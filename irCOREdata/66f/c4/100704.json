In 181Re, two t-bands are found to be energetically\nfavored relative to the usual rotation-aligned s-bands, presenting an alternative form of cold nuclear\nrotation. Interactions between the bands are weak, and unambiguous comparisons with tilted-axis-\ncranking calculations can be made. [S0031-9007(97)03669-7]\nPACS numbers: 21.10.Re, 21.10.Jx, 23.20.Gq, 27.70.+qRotational excitations in atomic nuclei have long been\na source of information about the underlying nucleonic\nstructure. A dramatic increase in apparent moment of\ninertia, known as backbending, was first discovered [1] in\n160Dy at an angular momentum of I \u00f8 16h\u00af, and is now\nwell established as a general feature of nuclear rotation.\nIn well deformed, axially symmetric nuclei, backbending\nhas been understood [2] to be due to the alignment of\nthe angular momentum of a pair of high-j nucleons along\nthe rotation axis, so that the mean angular-momentum\ncomponent along the symmetry axis (perpendicular to the\nrotation axis) is kKl \u00f8 0. The aligned structure (s-band)\nbecomes favored in energy at high spin and crosses the\nnonaligned structure (g band).\nIn the A \u00f8 180 mass region, where backbending is\ndue to a pair of i13y2 neutrons, it has been proposed\n[3,4] that a new structure arises due to the Fermi-aligned\n[4,5] coupling scheme which is active in the middle of\nthe neutron shell (N \u00f8 104). In this scheme the nucleon\nangular-momentum precesses about an axis lying between\nthe rotation and symmetry axes. The projections of the\nangular momentum onto the symmetry axis, K , and the\nrotation axis, i, are both localized at a nonzero value.\nThis differs from the strong-coupling scheme in which the\nnucleon angular-momentum precesses about the nuclear\nsymmetry axis resulting in good K , with kil \u00f8 0. States\nformed from a pair of Fermi-aligned nucleons have K \u00f8\njK1 6 K2j and i \u00f8 i1 1 i2, resulting in the usual s states,\nhaving K \u00f8 0, and also t states having large K and a\ntotal angular momentum tilted between the rotation and\nsymmetry axes. The s- and t-bands compete for \u201cyrast\u201d\nstatus (the lowest energy for a given angular momentum)\ncorresponding to cold nuclear rotation. The nature and\nextent of this competition is not yet understood, and\nthe possibility of there being large-amplitude high-K\ncomponents in the yrast bands of nuclei with N \u00f8 1040031-9007y97y79(4)y605(4)$10.00is contrary to the usual interpretation of backbending as\nintrinsically a low-K phenomenon.\nEvidence for the role of t-band structures in backbend-\ning has been observed in 179,180W [3,6] and 181,182Os [7]\n(with proton numbers Z \u00ad 74, 76, respectively). How-\never, only in 179W are the band interactions sufficiently\nweak to enable a clear signature to be obtained of the high-\nK band crossing, and in this unique case a chance near de-\ngeneracy at the band crossing could be responsible for the\nspecial features. Furthermore, rotational models [4] have\nfailed to reproduce the band crossings in 179W. Conse-\nquently, the generality of t-bands being a significant struc-\ntural feature in the A \u00f8 180 region has been in doubt.\nAs yet no evidence for t-bands has been found in odd-\nZ nuclei. Apart from the need for additional information\nabout t-bands, the odd proton can be expected to enhance\nM1 transitions, and allow M1yE2 branching ratios to\nbe measured for rotational states with the potential of\nproviding new structural information. Odd-Z t-bands\nwould also have different pairing and residual spin-spin\ninteractions compared to the odd-N and even-even cases,\ntesting the concepts that have so far been proposed [3,4].\nAn experiment to investigate the Z \u00ad 75 nucleus 181Re,\nan isotone of 180W and 182Os, with N \u00ad 106, was car-\nried out at the Australian National University 14UD tan-\ndem accelerator. An 11B beam of energy 77 MeV was\nincident on a self-supporting 5 mgycm2 176Yb target. The\nbeam energy was chosen to maximize production of high\nangular-momentum states in the 176Ybs11B, 6nd181Re reac-\ntion. Gamma rays were detected using the CAESAR ar-\nray of six Compton-suppressed germanium detectors and\ntwo unsuppressed planar LEPS detectors. The beam was\nbunched and chopped to give 1 ns wide pulses separated by\n1.7 ms. This allowed measurement of g-ray coincidences\nacross isomers with half-lives of up to 10 ms in strongly\npopulated cases. A total of 3 3 108 gg coincidences was\u00a9 1997 The American Physical Society 605\nVOLUME 79, NUMBER 4 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 28 JULY 1997recorded\u2014including energy and time relative to the beam\npulse for each g ray. In addition, singles-g-ray energy and\ntime measurements were performed in which a beam with\n1 ms pulses separated by 20 ms was used, allowing the\nobservation of longer half-lives. The beam-pulsing and\ntime information allowed highly sensitive measurements\nof g rays above and below isomers, which proved vital\nin deducing the level structure. 181Re has a complex de-\ncay scheme with two strongly populated long-lived iso-\nmers with half-lives of 1.4 and 11 ms, three isomers having\nhalf-lives of ,100 ns, and one short-lived isomer with a\nhalf-life of ,20 ns.\nA complementary data set was obtained at the Niels\nBohr Institute Tandem Accelerator Laboratory, for\nprompt (in-beam) events. The 150Nds36S, p4nd181Re re-\naction was employed at a beam energy of 166 MeV, with\nstacked targets of approximately 1 Mgycm2 total thick-\nness. The Nordball array, equipped with 20 germanium\ndetectors, and a \u201cSi-ball\u201d charged-particle array, consist-\ning of 21 DE detectors of 170 mm thickness, was used to\ncollect approximately 3 3 107 gg-particle coincidences.\nThe results are consistent with the CAESAR data. A\ndetailed comparison of the two data sets will be made in\na later full report on this work.FIG. 1. Partial decay scheme for 181Re, showing the rotational bands based on the 9y22f514g and 5y21f402g one-quasiparticle\nstates, the associated t-bands, and their decay paths. Energies are in keV.606Fourteen sequences of rotational states were identified\nbased on one, three, and five quasiparticle structures, of\nwhich three were known [8] previously. The partial decay\nscheme relevant to this Letter, shown in Fig. 1, focuses on\ntwo pairs of interacting one- and three-quasiparticle bands\nassociated with the 5y21f402g and 9y22f514g Nilsson\norbitals which are close to the proton Fermi surface. The\n5y21f402g band was known up to spin 252 h\u00af [8] but is now\nobserved up to spin 452 h\u00af. A new band based on an Ip \u00ad\n21y21 state at 1858 keV is observed up to spin 532 h\u00af. It\nhas a well defined bandhead which decays via a 164 keV\ntransition to a previously identified [8] Ip \u00ad s17y21d\nstate at 1694 keV. The band based on the 1858 keV state\ncrosses the Kp \u00ad 5y21 band at I \u00ad 25y2, where out-of-\nband transitions to the Kp \u00ad 5y21 band compete with\nin-band transitions.\nA second pair of interacting one- and three-quasiparticle\nbands is observed. The band based on the 9y22f514g\nNilsson orbital is now identified up to spin 432 h\u00af compared\nto the spin 232 h\u00af known from previous work [8]. The\nnew band based on the Ip \u00ad 25y22 state at 2225 keV is\nobserved up to spin 552 h\u00af. It has a well defined bandhead\nwhich decays via a 345 keV transition to a known [8]\n11 ms isomer at 1881 keV. The band based on the\nVOLUME 79, NUMBER 4 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 28 JULY 19972225 keV state crosses the Kp \u00ad 9y22 band at I \u00ad\n27\n2 h\u00af, where out-of-band transitions to the Kp \u00ad 9y22\nband compete with in-band transitions. Strong DI \u00ad 1\ntransitions are seen through each band.\nGiven the previous one-quasiparticle band assignments\n[8], the present spin and parity assignments of the\nhigher-spin levels are determined by the regularity of\nthe rotational sequences, the systematically competing\nDI \u00ad 1 and DI \u00ad 2 transitions, and a consistent set\nof g-g angular correlation (DCO) ratios. In particular,\nthe 514 keV (25y21 ! 21y21) and 544 keV (27y22 !\n23y22) interband transitions have stretched quadrupole\ncharacter. The assignments are also consistent with the\nband-crossing interpretation (see below) whereby close-\nlying states of equal spin and parity mix sufficiently to\nenable interband transitions to compete with collective\nintraband transitions.\nThe two pairs of bands behave in a similar way,\nas illustrated in Fig. 2 (top). In each case the one-\nquasiparticle band is crossed by what appears to be a\nband of the same parity and with an additional eight units\nof K (assuming that the K value is equal to the spin\nof the bandhead). Since the Fermi surface at N \u00ad 106\nFIG. 2. Energies and BsM1dyBsE2d ratios corresponding to\nthe bands shown in Fig. 1. The upper panels show experimen-\ntal energies, with an arbitrary rigid-rotor reference subtracted\nin order to highlight the band-crossing features. The middle\npanels show the corresponding energies from TAC calculations.\nThe lower panels show the experimental BsM1dyBsE2d ratios\n(symbols) for the energetically favored states, together with val-\nues from TAC calculations (full and dotted lines).is between the 7y21f633g and 9y21f624g Nilsson orbits,\neach of i13y2 character, it is reasonable to attribute the\nincrease in K to the excitation of this neutron pair coupled\nto Kp \u00ad 81. At each band crossing a moment-of-inertia\nincrease is indicated by the change in slope [Fig. 2\n(top)]. This corresponds to an alignment increase of\n,6h\u00af, due to the Fermi alignment of the high-j neutrons.\nThe crossing bands are therefore interpreted as t-bands,\ncomposed of two i13y2 neutrons and a spectator proton,\nanalogous to the t-bands found in the neighboring odd-\nN nuclei, 179W [3], and 181Os [7], where the spectator\nis a 7y22f514g neutron. A significant difference is that\nin 181Re the band crossings involve almost negligible\nperturbations of the level energies, with interaction matrix\nelements less than 8 keV. At first sight it appears\nsurprising that, with such a small interaction, each high-\nK band has strong g-ray branches to its partner one-\nquasiparticle band at the crossing. This is, however,\nconsistent with the K values discussed above, with band\ninteractions of only 4 keV (c.f. [3] for detailed discussion\nof the methods used to determine the interactions) and\narises because the high-K intraband transition strengths\nare strongly retarded by their small angular-momentum-\ncoupling (Clebsch-Gordan) coefficients.\nA consistent picture emerges of high-K t-bands that\nbecome yrast relative to their one-quasiparticle g-band\npartners. In each case the structural change at the band\ncrossing is the excitation of two i13y2 neutrons coupled\nto K \u00f8 8, where the approximation sign is used to\nacknowledge that the Fermi alignment leads to some\nspreading of the K distribution. This is precisely the\nsituation that has been modeled by tilted-axis-cranking\n(TAC) calculations [4] for odd-N 179W. The TAC model\nis in contrast to the usual principal-axis-cranking (PAC)\nmodel [9] in which the high-spin states are generated\nby cranking about an axis perpendicular to the nuclear\nsymmetry axis. The PAC model could not be expected to\ngive a consistent description of high-K rotational bands,\nsince these have a significant fraction of the angular\nmomentum aligned with the symmetry axis. However, the\nTAC model permits the total angular-momentum vector\nto be at an angle intermediate between the symmetry axis\nand the rotation axis. This additional degree of freedom\nis required if a cranking model is to be able to describe\nhigh-K structures. Nevertheless, in the application to the\nodd-N case, 179W [4], strong interactions between the\ncalculated bands resulted in ambiguities in the comparison\nwith experiment, and the calculated s-band appears to be\nlower in energy than the t-band at high spin, contrary to\nexperiment.\nTAC calculations have now been performed for odd-\nZ 181Re, using standard deformation and pair-gap param-\neters (\u00ab2 \u00ad 0.225, \u00ab4 \u00ad 0.046, Dp \u00ad 0.87 MeV, Dn \u00ad\n0.67 MeV). The calculated and experimental 181Re level\nenergies are compared in Fig. 2. Although no fitting has\nbeen attempted and the gradients are not well reproduced,607\nVOLUME 79, NUMBER 4 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 28 JULY 1997other qualitative features are in good accord with the data.\nAn unambiguous comparison between observed and cal-\nculated t-band crossings can be made for the first time.\nThe t-bands are calculated to become energetically fa-\nvored, as observed, and the gradual gradient decrease in\nthe unfavored g-band extensions can be identified with\ns-band crossings. The comparison between calculation\nand experiment shows a considerable improvement over\nthe 179W situation [4], which appears to be related to\nthe interactions between the 181Re bands being weaker\n(most likely due to less blocking of the neutron pairing\nin the odd-Z nucleus). The calculated t-band wave func-\ntions are also of interest. For example, close to the band\ncrossing, the t-band that crosses the 9y22f514g band has\nkKl \u00ad 12.2, which is close to the strong-coupling limit of\nK \u00ad 12.5 (for two i13y2 neutrons coupled to K \u00ad 8, to-\ngether with the K \u00ad 9y2 proton).\nThe present data contain many DI \u00ad 1 transitions from\nwhich estimates of the magnetic dipole strength can be\nmade. It is therefore possible for the first time to make\ncomparisons with the TAC model calculation of the\nM1 transition rates [4,10], relative to the collective E2\ntransitions, through the t-band crossings. This is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 2 (bottom), for the energetically favored\nsequences, i.e., for the states having the lowest energy\nfor a given spin, above the 9y22f514g and 5y21f402g\none-quasiparticle states. The TAC calculations (full and\ndotted lines) give a reasonable description of the data,\nthough in the absence of detailed level-energy agree-\nment, the quality of the transition-rate comparisons is dif-\nficult to judge. The poorer agreement for the 5y21f402g\nt-band may be due to interactions with another (in this\ncase unidentified) positive-parity sequence, possibly asso-\nciated with the observed 1694 keV intrinsic state. The\nrapid decrease with spin of the BsM1dyBsE2d ratio close\nto each bandhead can be understood as arising from the\ngeometrical factors (angular-momentum coupling coef-\nficients) associated with the K value, or, in the TAC\ncalculations, from the increasing tilt angle, u, where\nBsM1dyBsE2d ~ 1y sin2 u in the strong-coupling limit\n[10]. [Note that the experimental BsM1d values have been\nobtained assuming no E2 component in the DI \u00ad 1 tran-\nsitions; these E2 components are estimated to be less than\n10%, which is supported by measured g-ray angular dis-\ntributions where available.] The lack of detailed quanti-\ntative agreement for the t-bands may be, at least in part,\na consequence of the simplified assumption of equal neu-\ntron pairing for all bands. Reduced neutron pairing would\nbe expected in the t-bands. This would reduce the rota-\ntional g factors and increase the proton contribution to the\nM1 matrix element, but these effects have not yet been\nexplored in detail.\nThe involvement of t-bands in the explanation of\nanomalous (weakly hindered) K-isomer decays has608already been demonstrated [3] in 179W. The present\ndata, together with their qualitative description by the\nTAC model, suggest a more widespread influence of\nt-bands, which provide a mechanism for the intro-\nduction of large-amplitude, high-K components into\nA \u00f8 180 yrast bands. Hence, t-bands would have an\nimportant role to play in determining multiquasiparticle\nisomer decay rates. It is hoped that the new data for\n181Re will stimulate more detailed theoretical evaluation\nof the phenomenon, including the effect of residual\nspin-spin interactions which have not been included\nin the TAC calculations. Generalized Gallagher-\nMoszkowski rules [11] favor parallel intrinsic-spin\ncouplings for unlike nucleon pairs (n \" p \" and n # p #)\nand antiparallel couplings for like pairs (n \" n # and\np \" p #). Residual interactions in even-even nuclei would\ntherefore favor s-bands (n \" n #) over t-bands (n \" n \")\nwith regard to bandhead energies (by ,200 keV). How-\never, there is no such favoring for the 181Re, 9y22f514g \"\nand 5y21f402g \" s-bands (p \" n \" n #) compared to their\nrespective t-bands (p \" n \" n \") when all pair interactions\nare considered. Indeed, the higher spin of the bandhead\nfor the high-K coupling enables these t-bands to become\nyrast. Other couplings, such as to the 7y21f404g # proton,\nwould form energetically unfavored t-bands (p # n \" n \")\nwhich would not become yrast.\nIn summary, clear signatures have been found for two\nt-bands involving si13y2d2, K \u00f8 8 couplings in 181Re. In\neach case it is the t-band and not the s-band which gives\nrise to backbending in the associated yrast sequence. This\nis the first observation of t-bands in an odd-Z nucleus, and\nthe first observation of more than one t-band in a nucleus.\nTAC calculations provide a reasonable description of the\nexperimental data. It is suggested that t-bands are of more\ngeneral importance than has hitherto been recognized.\nExperiments at the ANU have been carried out through\naccess under the ANU-EPSRC agreement, and with the\nsupport of EPSRC Grant No. GRyJ95867.\n[1] A.
