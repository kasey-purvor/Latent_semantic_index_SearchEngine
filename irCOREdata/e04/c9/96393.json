Introduction1  \nThis paper is about the fundamental drivers of urban growth: in particular in a European institutional \nand geographic context. There is a powerful and rigorous US tradition analysing regional or urban \ngrowth in a neo-classical framework assuming full spatial equilibrium. A good exemplar is Glaeser \net al (1995). They build on the compensating differentials model of Roback (1982). Full spatial \nequilibrium implies that people cannot improve their welfare by moving from one location to another \nwhether that is between neighbourhoods in one city or from one city to another. Differences in \nprices, for quality constant houses, or wages, for productivity constant workers, signal differences in \nthe value of environmental amenities across space. People equalise real welfare, not even just real \nwages, across space, so they accept higher house prices and\/or lower wages to live and\/or work in \nmore desirable locations. So Glaeser et al (1995) conclude that since people vote with their feet, the \nbest measure of changing patterns of spatial welfare is differential rates of population growth as a \nresult of net migration: not differential rates of productivity growth, manifesting itself in different \nrates of output or GDP per capita growth. \n \nEmpirically the most important of these environmental factors leading to quality of life differences \nbetween regions seems to be climate (see Graves, 1976; 1980 and 1983; or 2003a & b; Rappaport, \n2007) but there is a more elaborate literature analysing spatial differences in the \u2018quality of life\u2019 \nbuilding on full spatial equilibrium as an underlying assumption. Gyourko and Tracy (1991), for \nexample, include in their estimates the implied value of differences in local public goods. Several \nrecent articles by Glaeser and associates (for example Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2006) implicitly use the \nassumption of full spatial equilibrium as support for an analysis of the causes of \u2018urban resurgence\u2019 \nand the rediscovery of the \u2018consumer city\u2019. They observe real wages have been falling in cities \nrelative to non-urban areas because urban productivity and wages have not risen as fast as urban \nhouse prices. Since city population(s) have been stabilising, however, they conclude that urban \nresurgence is more because of the rising attractiveness of cities as places to live (significantly \nbecause of falling urban crime rates) than because of increasing agglomeration economies driving \nfactor productivity growth in cities compared to non-urban areas. \n \nEurope is a continent of nation states with only recent and partial steps towards integration. It is, \nmoreover, a continent of geographically very sticky people. The reasons for Europeans\u2019 low \nresponsiveness to differences in opportunities across space seem complex. The costs of movement \nare high compared to the US, because of transactions costs and housing policies (social housing is a \nmuch larger fraction of the stock in most EU countries and place-specific and rent controlled housing \nties people to their existing locations). Probably more important, however, are differences in culture, \nlanguage and institutions. For whatever reason, in an earlier paper (Cheshire and Magrini, 2006) we \nshowed that while population movement across the EU of 12 between 1980 and 2000 did \nsignificantly respond to generalised differences in economic advantage (as reflected, for example, in \nthe systematic spatial effects of European integration or regional inheritances of old resource-based \nindustries), and also responded to climatic differences, the evidence was inconsistent with full spatial \nequilibrium. The response of population movement to economic factors was sluggish; net migration \nrates between comparably sized regions in the USA are fifteen times greater than in Europe \n(Cheshire and Magrini, 2006). Perhaps more telling, population movement responded strongly to \nclimatic differences but only to climatic differences within countries. There was no significant \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 3 \nmigration response to climatic differences measured across Europe as a whole. Moreover population \ngrowth interactions between regions were strongly impeded by national borders. \n \nThis finding provides additional interest to trying to understand better the drivers of urban economic \ngrowth \u2013 the main focus of this paper. It implies that Europe is not typified by full spatial equilibrium \nand even if migration flows did reduce spatial disparities, real differences in welfare between regions \nmay be strongly persistent. Differences in levels of real per capita GDP or in its growth, are unlikely \nto be fully offset by counterbalancing differences in environmental quality or amenities. This \ninvestigation of the drivers of economic growth differences across the city-regions of the EU has \nimplications for wider themes, therefore. It carries strong implications for whether it is reasonable to \nthink of a single European \u2018urban system\u2019; it sheds light on the mechanisms producing spatial \neconomic adjustment and how national borders still impede this while dense urbanisation and good \ntransport links facilitate it; it reveals an important limitation of the Tiebout hypothesis\n2\n; and it \nimplies that concern for spatial disparities in GDP per capita or growth, may be reasonable in \nEurope, if policy aims to reduce spatial welfare differences for similar individuals.   \n \nIn addressing questions of differential spatial growth the question immediately arises: what are the \nmost appropriate spatial units to look at? US urban scholars automatically use data for core-based \nmetropolitan regions (or CBSAs)\n3\n.  These were originally known as Standard Metropolitan Areas \n(SMAs) but precise criteria for defining them and the names applied have evolved over time. US \ntextbooks such as Mills and Hamilton (1994) or DiPasquale and Wheaton (1996) hardly discuss the \nreasons for using data for this standard urban concept or even alternative definitions of urban areas, \nexcept to mention the existence of administrative \u2018cities\u2019. A good review of US and European \nconcepts and definitions of urban areas and how US definitions have evolved over time is provided \nin Freeman (2005).  \n \nData for core-based city-regions have a number of critical advantages: criteria used to define them \nare uniform across the whole US, so while political boundaries compared to actual settlement \npatterns are highly variable, the data for CBSAs relate to comparable concepts of \u2018city\u2019; because \nCBSAs include both employment and the residents who hold the jobs, they are in economic terms as \nself-contained as spatial subdivisions of national economies are likely to be; they cover the whole \nurban area, so they abstract from patterns of residential segregation \u2013 they include all citizens, both \nrich and poor, and all ethnic groups. The data for these US core-based city-regions are also available \nas time series \u2013 for population going back to 1790 \u2013 for both constant definitional boundaries and \nboundaries which evolve as settlements evolved and commuting systems expanded.  \n \nSome European countries have data for consistent definitions of urban areas for long periods \u2013 the \nFrench data for a particular definition of the built-up area of cities - the agglom\u00e9ration - are available \nback to 1831 (Gu\u00e9rin-Pace, 1995); others have data for core-based functional definitions of \u2018city\u2019 \n(for example Germany); but unfortunately definitions vary greatly across countries and some \ncounty\u2019s definitions do not usefully translate to others. For example, in France, until recently the \nconcept of the agglom\u00e9ration corresponded quite closely to that of a city-region since land use \nplanning in France permitted continuous expansion of built-up areas and did not attempt to impose \ngrowth boundaries (unlike the British or Dutch systems) and urban centres in France are mainly \nsome distance apart. Applying the French agglom\u00e9ration concept to the very different legal and \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 4 \ngeographical setting of Belgium, however, ends up having just one continuous Belgian city \u2013 \nstretching from Antwerp to Li\u00e9ge. As a result it is not surprising that even some European urban \nscholars wanting to understand more about how cities work have turned to US data (one of many \nexamples would be Duranton and Puga, 2005). There is a large enough number of consistently \ndefined city-regions in the US for statistical analysis and the data are comparable and freely \navailable. \n \nThe analysis in this paper employs data for a specific definition of core-based city regions - Functional \nUrban Regions (FURs \u2013 see section 2) \u2013 in the EU of 12. More detail is given in Section 3 but the FUR \ndataset was first constructed as the foundation for a research project funded by the European \nCommission during the 1980s (and that drew on earlier work by Hall and Hay, 1980). The results of \nthis, together with details of how the FURs were defined and some of the data, were set out in Cheshire \nand Hay, 1989. This FUR dataset has been continuously updated and expanded and the analysis \nreported here uses the most recent version. In Appendix 2 we provide an illustrative map of these FURs \nand more detailed maps for two countries showing how their boundaries relate to those of the official \nadministrative regions.  \n \n2. Issues and approach \nIn a world characterised by full spatial equilibrium and a constant distribution of environmental \namenities the drivers of spatial population growth would be the direct complement of the drivers of \neconomic growth. Both processes are worth investigating but understanding one illuminates the \nother. The finding reported in Cheshire and Magrini (2006) that full spatial equilibrium is not a \nreasonable assumption in the context of European spatial development therefore focuses additional \ninterest in understanding better what factors drive urban economic growth differentials \u2013 the subject \nof this paper.  \n \n The \u2018new economic geography\u2019, initiated by Krugman (1991), has re-awakened interest amongst \nmainstream economists in agglomeration economies; as a result, interest in cities and their \ncontribution to economic productivity has risen up the agenda. At the same time, internationalisation \nof the world\u2019s economy and European integration have created an interest in and focused more \npolicy efforts on, local economic development. Against this background we hope this paper makes a \nparticular contribution: to understanding the fundamental drivers of urban growth and the welfare \nimpacts differences in growth may generate; how such growth should be measured and the \nimplications of alternative measures; and how these forces play out in the particular European \ncontext of geographically sticky people, continuing national barriers to adjustment but dense \nurbanisation. At the same time we apply the tools of spatial econometrics to help understand and \ninterpret spatial economic processes rather than as simply diagnostic tools or providers of technical \nfixes.  \n \nIn developing and testing propositions about the sources of urban growth we draw as clearly as possible \non underlying theory. One contribution of this paper is to test \u2013 indirectly - whether local growth \npolicies have any positive impact on growth. We do this, however starting from a theoretical proposition \nin local public finance and treating the production of additional local growth as if it were the production \nof a local public good. When we explore the empirical results for evidence and sources of spatial \ndependence we attempt to provide an economic interpretation for those results, and draw implications \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 5 \nfor the extent of spatial disequilibrium in Western Europe and the claim that Europe is a \u2018network of \ncities\u2019 (Kresl, 2007 page 1).  \n \nOur conclusion is that city-regions in the EU behave like city-states, but city-states confined by national \nboundaries.  Their trajectories are influenced by conditions in their neighbours within their own \ncountries but they do not behave as simply the spatial units from which an integrated continental \neconomy is constructed. This implies that differences in GDP per capita across EU cities not only reflect \ndifferences in productivity but also differences in welfare. \n \nIn this paper while we are using cross sectional growth models, we are not taking the convergence \napproach of the numerous studies following Barro (1990) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991). For \nrecent surveys of the \u03b2-convergence literature see, for example, Durlauf and Quah (1999), Temple \n(1999) or Magrini (2004). We reject the \u03b2-convergence approach as uninformative and perhaps \nmisleading for both theoretical and empirical reasons. Theoretical reasons are discussed in Cheshire and \nMalecki (2004). The analysis done for this paper reinforces the empirical objections to the approach.  \n \nThe \u03b2-convergence approach includes the initial level of GDP p.c. as an independent variable (with a \nrange of additional control variables to account for differences in steady states and idiosyncratic \n\u2018shocks\u2019) and tests whether poorer nations\/regions at the start of the given period grow faster on average \nthan those that were richer. To the extent that they do, this provides a measure of their rate of \nconvergence. Where the observational units are subdivisions of national territories, such as regions, then \nthe standard approach is to include national dummies to control for all country-specific omitted \nvariables. On theoretical grounds our preference is not to use national dummies to control for country-\nspecific effects (such as the temporal incidence of the economic cycle, institutional or policy \ndifferences) systematically affecting FUR growth, but to include the rate of growth of the national \nterritories outside the areas of the major FURs. That major FURs do not exhaust national territories is \nthus turned to advantage, since it allows the estimation of a continuous variable (\u2018non-FUR growth\u2019) to \naccount for national specific factors in urban growth differentials. This is consistent with the underlying \nassumption in cross-sectional regression models that the observational units are representative of a \nhomogeneous statistical population. It also has the practical advantage of avoiding having to pool FURs \nfor those countries with only one or a very small number of major cities (such as Ireland, Denmark, \nGreece or Portugal).  \n \nWhat emerges is that our preferred variable not only statistically dominates national dummies but, once \nincluded, renders the initial level of FUR GDP p.c. non-significant and the parameter estimate unstable. \nIf both the initial level of FUR GDP p.c. and non-FUR growth are included as additional independent \nvariables of interest, in some models apparently (non-significant) convergence emerges; in others non-\nsignificant divergence emerges. Clearly including both the initial level of FUR GDP p.c. and the non-\nFUR growth variables introduces collinearity. The remedy for problems of collinearity, if additional \nobservations are not available, is to exclude the least satisfactory variable associated with the problem. \nSince we have both theoretical and empirical reasons for excluding it, therefore, we exclude the initial \nlevel of FUR GDP p.c. This is consistent with our aim which is to understand more fully drivers of \nurban growth differentials rather than to investigate \u03b2-convergence which we consider theoretically \nunsatisfactory anyway. Our underlying view is that regional growth differences are multivariate: the \nimpact of some drivers is towards convergence (e.g. factor mobility in sectors without economies of \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 6 \nscale) while the impact of others is towards divergence (e.g. those involving agglomeration or \neconomies of scale) and which of the convergence\/divergence effects dominates in any particular time \nperiod is an empirical issue. \n \nWe are interested in testing theoretically derived ideas about urban growth. For this we have three \ngroups of variables; two of these were tested in an earlier paper (Cheshire and Magrini, 2000) but now \nmore rigorously. The first group relates to the systematic spatial effects of European integration on \nurban growth. Concern about these goes back at least to Clark et al. (1969) and it is interesting to use as \nan independent variable the quantitative measures actually predicted by Clark before the impact of \nEuropean integration was significantly felt. Theoretical developments of New Economic Geography \n(summarised in Fujita et al. 1999) have given a significant boost to interest in this potential source of \ndifferential urban growth. In addition to the variable measuring Clark et al\u2019s (1969) change in regional \neconomic potential, associated with EU integration, we now introduce a \u2018peripherality\u2019 dummy, \nexploiting the insights gained testing for spatial dependence.  \n \nThe second group of variables we are interested in attempts to capture the role of R&D and highly \nskilled human capital in urban growth processes. It is admittedly a crude test but does show whether the \nevidence is or is not consistent with a spatialised adaptation of endogenous growth theory (see, for \nexample, Cheshire, 1995 or Magrini, 1998). In the revised data set used here we have new measures \nwhich prove slightly more significant and illuminating than results reported previously.  \n \nThe third area is entirely new; this is the relationship between systems of local and regional government \nand city growth performance. This relates to the wider issue of the provision of local public goods when \nthere is also the possibility of what might be called an \u2018anti-Tiebout\u2019 world (Tiebout, 1956) with \njurisdictional public good spillovers and geographically immobile people. In such circumstances, \noptimality may depend also on how jurisdictions are bounded. Local economic growth policies aim to \nincrease the rate of economic growth of the territory\/jurisdiction to which they are applied. If we \nsuspend our disbelief and assume such policies might influence growth rates \u2013 abstracting for the \nmoment from what form such policies might take \u2013 then it is clear that local policy makers would be \nproducing a local quasi-public good. So, the relevant issue is what factors favour the formation of more \neffective growth promotion \u2018clubs\u2019? The hypothesis advanced in Cheshire and Gordon (1996) was that \nsuch \u2018clubs\u2019 would be more likely to develop and be more strategically effective if the administrative \nboundaries of the jurisdiction more closely corresponded to those of the functional economic region. \nThe logic underlying this was that the more closely these boundaries coincided, the smaller would be \nspillover losses of growth gains to agents in surrounding jurisdictions and the lower would be the \ntransactions costs of forming a \u2018growth promotion club\u2019 because there would be fewer public sector \nagencies involved and a more obvious and powerful leading agency.  \n \nSince our FURs are designed to maximise self-containment\n4\n, they correspond to \u2018functional economic \nregions\u2019 and we are able, in effect, to test one of the basic propositions of fiscal federalism: that \u2018the \nexistence and magnitude of spillover effects clearly depends on the geographical extent of the relevant \njurisdiction\u2019 (Oates, 1999, page 1130). To test this we include as an independent variable a measure of \nthe extent to which the two sets of boundaries coincide for each FUR. If local growth promotion policies \nhave any positive effect then the expectation is that the more closely the two boundaries coincide the \nfaster a FUR\u2019s growth rate will be \u2013 other things equal. \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 7 \n \nSince we are analysing urban growth in a cross sectional model, we expect interactions between the \ngrowth performance of neighbouring cities. We have, therefore, paid particular attention to issues of \nspatial dependence. Contrary to the more orthodox spatial dependence literature (see, for example, Rey \nand Montouri, 1999 or Florax et al., 2003), we view indicated problems of spatial dependence as signs \nof omitted variable(s). If there is a problem of spatial dependence the model does not include variable(s) \nreflecting mechanisms that cause economic conditions in one FUR systematically to influence \ndevelopments in its neighbours. If these variables are not included, therefore, not only may parameter \nestimates be inconsistent (although there are econometric fixes available) but it should prompt \nresearchers to find suitable (spatial) variables reflecting the mechanisms giving rise to the spatial \ndependence. \n \nBoth theory and empirical evidence suggest that there are important spatial adjustment mechanisms and \nother spatially determined features of urban and regional economies. For example, labour markets and \nhousing markets adjust to price and real wage differences in ways conditioned on measures of \naccessibility. Both migration and commuting patterns are known to respond to spatial differences in \neconomic opportunities \u2013 whether of incomes or house prices \u2013 but the impact of a given differential in \neconomic opportunities declines as accessibility falls. Theoretical and empirical investigations of \nagglomeration economies, human capital and innovation suggest there are important spatial aspects of \nthese, too. These are all possible sources of spatial interaction between cities\u2019 economies and, if omitted, \nthey should plausibly cause spatial dependence.  \n \nOur results provide strong supporting evidence for this view. Models without variables reflecting spatial \nadjustment processes display significant problems of spatial dependence. However, when we include \nappropriate variables, discounted by distance between cities, these are statistically significant and \nindications of spatial dependence are eliminated.  \n \nIn addition, the sensitivity of our models to measures of spatial dependence varies with the particular \ndistance weights used. We interpret this, too, as providing insight into economic processes. We \nsystematically experiment with distance weights including \u2018distance\u2019 penalties for national borders. \nThese experiments confirm that problems of spatial dependence only reveal themselves if an additional \ndistance penalty to adjustment between neighbouring FURs is included for national borders, and that \nthis seems to be optimised, in some sense, if the penalty is set at 600 minutes. This, we judge, reinforces \nour earlier conclusion that urban systems in Western Europe still mainly adjust as a set of national urban \nsystems rather than as a unified EU urban system. European economic space is not a single integrated \nnetwork of cities. \n \n3. The data and methods \nThe basic method for defining the Functional Urban Regions analysed in this paper was to identify \nspatial units where there were at least 20 000 jobs and add to these all contiguous spatial units with a job \ndensity exceeding 12.35 jobs per hectare. These then define the \u2018city-cores\u2019 and for each of these, \nhinterlands were defined from which more commuters flowed to the core than to any other, subject to a \nminimum cut off level of commuting. They were defined on 1971 employment and commuting data\n5\n \nand as noted above are broadly similar to the Core Based Areas used in the US although FUR \nhinterlands tend to be extensive where there are no competing employment centres (examples are \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 8 \nLisbon or Dublin). FURs thus correspond to the economic spheres of influence of significant \nemployment concentrations. Here we are only analysing data for the largest FURs \u2013 those with a \npopulation of a third of a million in 1981 and a core exceeding 200 000 at some date since 1951. The \nunification of Germany means that comparable data for the current FUR of Berlin are only available \nsince 1990. So Berlin and the FURs of the former GDR are excluded. This leaves a total of 121 FURs. \n \nApart from the advantage of being economically self-contained, the great variability in the relationship \nbetween administrative and economic boundaries of European cities and regions introduces serious error \nand potential bias into data reported for administrative boundaries. The EU\u2019s Nomenclature des Unit\u00e9s \nTerritoriales Statistiques (NUTS) regions are a nesting set which tries to reconcile different national \nterritorial divisions. The largest are Level 1 regions; the smallest with reasonable data availability are \nLevel 3. The size of these NUTS regions \u2013 even within the same \u2018Level\u2019 and country \u2013 is highly \nvariable. A further problem is that no \u2018Level\u2019 is represented in every country: in many they exist only \nfor statistical reporting. Thus, the most widely used regions \u2013 Level 2 \u2013 do not exist in Germany or the \nUK. Particularly in Germany, this presents serious data problems because the Level 1 regions, \ncorresponding to the L\u00e4nder, have considerable independence and their own statistical services. In \naddition, Germany has not had a population census since 1987 and uses its own labour market regions \nfor most labour market data\n6\n.  \n \nOne of the variables most subject to distortion using NUTS boundaries is GDP p.c. because GDP is \nestimated at workplaces while people are counted where they live. Because people commute to work \nacross administrative boundaries, this means GDP p.c. is systematically overestimated for regions where \nthe administrative boundaries exclude significant dormitory areas. In reality, this happens for a large \nnumber of bigger European cities (Madrid and Paris are two exceptions if we take the Level 1 regions \nwhich contain them), so official figures tend to systematically overstate GDP p.c. for large cities. At last, \nthis distortion of GDP p.c. data has been recognised by Eurostat (Eurostat, 2005). Following the 1998 \nsplit of Greater London into two official regions\n7\n \u2013 Inner and Outer London \u2013 the absurdity of the \nresulting GDP p.c. measures \u2013 with Inner London having a reported per capita GDP 3.15 times the EU \nmean \u2013 became too great to continue to ignore.  \n \nThe FUR and NUTS region of Bremen provide an extreme example of how this distorts measured \ngrowth rates as well as levels of GDP p.c. as, over time, people move relative to jobs. Because of strong \npopulation decentralisation over the period, the growth of GDP p.c. is overstated by some 40% for the \n1980s if the Eurostat data for the NUTS Level 1 region identified as Bremen are relied on.  \n \nThe variables used are identified in Table 1. All variables are scaled so that estimated parameter \nvariables are of similar orders of magnitude to help presentation. Appendix Table 1 gives more detail, \nincluding the sources used and descriptive statistics. FUR growth in real GDP p.c. is estimated from \ncommon PPS values of GDP p.c. for Eurostat Level 3 regions. We estimate GDP p.c. for FURs using \nthe proportionate distribution of FUR population between Level 3 regions at the closest practical dates \nand applying these as weights to the relevant Level 3 GDP p.c.\n8\n To minimise the effects of measurement \nerror, we take the start and end points of the series as the means for the first and last three years. \nRegional GDP data have been published for most Level 1, 2 and 3 regions since 1978 although there is \nfragmentary earlier data. There are, however, gaps even since 1978 \u2013 data for Greek and Portuguese \nregions, for example, did not become available until the mid-1980s. In both cases, Eurostat data have \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 9 \nbeen supplemented with national data. For some countries \u2013 Italy for example \u2013 data for earlier years \nwere only published for Level 2 regions. National sources of value added for smaller spatial units have \nbeen used as necessary to disaggregate from Level 2.   \n \nTable 1: Variable Definitions \nNo Variable Name Description \n Constant  \n1 Population Size Population size in 1979 (natural logarithm) \n2 Population Density Density of population in FUR in 1979 (1000 inhabitants\/Km\n2\n)\n \n3 Coalfield: core Dummy = 1 if the core of the FUR is located within a coalfield \n4 Coalfield: hinterland Dummy = 1 if the hinterland of the FUR is located in a coalfield \n5 Port Size * Volume of port trade in 1969 (100 tons) \n6 Agriculture * \nProportionate share of labour force in agriculture in surrounding NUTS 2 \nin 1975 \n7 Unemployment * Unemployment rate (average as proportion of LF between 1977 and 1981) \n8 National Non-FUR Growth \nGrowth of GDP p.c. in the territory of each country outside the major \nFURs (annualised rate between 1978\/80 and 1992\/94) \n9 Policy Incentive * \nRatio of the population of the largest governmental unit associated with \nthe FUR to that of the FUR in 1981 \n10 Integration Gain \nChange in economic potential for FUR resulting from pre-Treaty of Rome \nEEC to post enlargement EU with reduced transport costs normalised. \n11 Peripherality  Dummy = 1 if the FUR is more than 10 hours away from Brussels \n12 University Students * Ratio of university students (1977-78) to total employment (1979) \n13 R&D Facilities * R&D laboratories of Fortune 500 companies per 1000 inhabitants in 1980 \n14 Unemployment Density  \nSum of differences between the unemployment (average as proportion of \nLF between 1977 and 1981) of a FUR and the rates in neighbouring FURs \n(within 2 hours), discounted by distance (with 10 hours time penalty for \nnational borders) \n15 University Students Density \nSum of university students per employees in neighbouring FURs (within \n2.5 hours), discounted by distance (with 10 hours time penalty for national \nborders) \n16 R&D Facilities Density \nSum of R&D laboratories per 1000 inhabitants in neighbouring FURs \n(within 2.5 hours), discounted by distance (with 10 hours time penalty for \nnational borders) \nNote: * denotes variables tried with a quadratic specification for reasons explained in the text: never entered as \nsquared value alone.  \n \n \nThe end point of our GDP series is 1994. Eurostat substantially revised the basis on which regional GDP \nwas estimated in 1995. It switched from a 1979 base for disaggregating national data (ESA79) to \n(ESA95). For the overlap year the differences between the two sets of values are remarkable \u2013 not even \ncountry totals coincide. Although some claim to bridge this discontinuity in regional GDP data, we have \nnot been able to do so to our satisfaction. So, our analysis finishes in 1994. We are thus analysing a \nperiod \u2013 1978-80 to 1992-94 \u2013 too short to correspond to a conceptual long run. This further reinforces \nour belief that we need to model a system in which real incomes can permanently (in the sense of any \nperiod we can observe) vary between cities.  \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 10 \n \nAll data are defined to common statistical concepts either weighting Eurostat data to estimate values for \nFURs (as with GDP p.c.) or collecting data directly from national statistical offices or common data \nproviders and adjusting where necessary to common definitions. There is necessarily imprecision where \nwe use estimated data but they have the merit of relating to functionally defined, economically self-\ncontained city-regions. The FURs, all being large metropolitan regions, are also substantially more \nhomogenous than either NUTS regions or countries. This is econometrically helpful and since they do \nnot exhaust national territories we can calculate the rate of GDP p.c. growth in the area of each country \noutside its major city-regions; as discussed above, this variable is \u2018non-FUR growth\u2019. This is a \ncontinuous variable and is a more elegant and useful control than national dummies for national specific \ndrivers of urban growth differentials. It is also consistent with our implicit claim that our observations \u2013 \nall the large city-regions of the EU of 12 \u2013 represent, in a statistical sense, a homogeneous population. \n \nThe analysis employs OLS but we test the results exhaustively for econometric problems. Since the \nobservations represent the population of West European city-regions, the force of the standard \nobjections to the use of cross sectional OLS for inference seem to be substantially mitigated. Compared \nto cross country \u2018growth regressions\u2019, our observations represent a relatively homogeneous population \nand data are more comparable. Our choice of spatial units should reduce or eliminate systematic spatial \nerror in the data, or \u2018nuisance\u2019 spatial dependence as Anselin and Rey called it (Anselin and Rey, 1991), \nand we make a strong effort to formulate variables to reflect causal mechanisms and minimise problems \nof endogeneity. As with all applied econometrics, however, in the end the credibility of the results is not \na categorical issue but depends on judgement. We are convinced multicollinearity is not a significant \nproblem and judge that this is also true with respect to endogeneity. But proving endogeneity is neither \npresent nor seriously distorting results is ultimately proving a negative and that is difficult. We \nnecessarily make compromises but believe that the departure from the ideal conditions is not so great \nthat the results are spurious for purposes of inference. \n \n4. Results \n4.1 The base model \nAs discussed above, our approach to testing the hypotheses relating to the role of European integration, \nhuman capital and R&D and arrangements for local government builds on previous work (Cheshire and \nMagrini, 2000). As the first step in our more elaborate strategy to investigate growth drivers we first find \na \u2018base model\u2019 (see Table 2) and test the resulting model for a range of econometric problems, including \nspatial dependence. Such tests show that while traditional standards for normality, functional form and \nheterskedasticity are satisfied, if the spatial weights matrix is formulated in an economically meaningful \nway (with an added time-distance penalty for national frontiers) there are indicated problems of spatial \ndependence which can be eliminated, without affecting the significance of other variables, by including \na spatial lag of the dependent variable. In a conventional spatial econometrics framework such a result \nmight have been considered satisfactory but we interpret the indications of spatial dependence as \nimplying that variables related to systematic spatial patterns of growth have been omitted.  \n \nSince the aim is to understand the drivers of differential patterns of spatial growth better we include the \nvariables designed to test the three hypotheses (Table 3) in the base model. Again exhaustive \nexperimentation with the spatial weights matrix suggests there are some problems of spatial dependence \n(Table 4). Instead of simply re-estimating with a spatial lagged model and stopping the investigation at \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 11 \nthis point, however, we include variables to reflect known information on drivers of differential spatial \npatterns of growth in the EU and on plausible spatial adjustment processes. Such variables are \nstatistically significant when included and eliminate all problems of spatial dependence without \nchanging other estimates. \n \nThis section explains the structure of the models and the reasons for variable inclusion. We try to make \nit self-contained but not too repetitive of previous published work. We concentrate on the results for the \nnew variables and the impact of spatial dependence. In all models, the dependent variable was the \nannualised rate of growth of FUR GDP p.c. at PPS from the mean of 1978\/\/80 to 1992\/4. The \u2018base \nmodel\u2019 includes a set of control variables and the non-FUR growth variable discussed above. As in \nprevious work the controls for industrial structure relate to measures of old resource-based industries \u2013 \nagriculture, coal mining and ports. These not only work better in statistical terms than broader measures \nof specialisation in manufacturing industry but, make better sense in economic terms and minimise \nproblems of endogeneity. Past dependence on the coal industry is measured by the geological presence \nof coal measures, so should avoid any hint of endogeneity, and specialisation in agriculture and the port \nindustry are both measured well before the start of the period to which the dependent variable relates.  \n \nOther controls are designed to reflect underlying (urban) economic theory and evidence. The log of \npopulation size is included with the expectation that larger cities would have grown faster because of \nproductivity gains in larger urban areas (see Costa and Kahn, 2000 for a convincing account of at least \none potential source for such gains). Dynamic agglomeration economies are another possible \nexplanation. Theory tells us that in an unregulated and unconstrained world, population density would \nbe a positive function of city size. Indeed population or employment density have been used in the \nliterature as variables to proxy for potential agglomeration economies. But there are severe regulatory \nconstraints applied in Europe influencing population density independently of city size. Rigid urban \ncontainment policies have, for example, been applied in the UK since 1947 and other countries, such as \nthe Netherlands, have policies for \u2018urban densification\u2019. So initial population density was included to \ncapture such impacts. Once agglomeration economies are controlled for with city size, cities with higher \ndensity will have higher costs of space and greater congestion. A negative relationship is expected. In \nour judgement, the main source of variation in initial population density is likely to be differences in the \nconstraint on urban land supply variations in land use regulation impose. Higher density, other things \nequal, signals a tighter constraint imposed on development. Topography and the inertia of inheritance \nembodied in the built environment no doubt contribute to differences in densities but probably less than \nland use policy which varies substantially both across countries and between cities (for recent evidence, \nsee Cheshire and Hilber, 2008). \n \nThe results for the base models are shown in Tables 2a & b which also report diagnostic statistics. All \nvariables are significant and have the expected sign and the adjusted R\n2\n is 0.56. Test statistics for the \nOLS model are generally satisfactory except those for spatial dependence. Table 2b reports the results of \nincluding a spatial lag. The results are effectively unchanged except that test results for spatial \ndependence are now satisfactory. \n \n \n \n \n \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 12 \nTable 2a:  Dependent Variable Annualised Rate of Growth of GDP p.c.

The theoretical reasons for \nexpecting a concentration of R&D activity and highly skilled human capital to have a positive impact on \nlocal economic growth follow the analysis of Romer (1990) adapted to a spatial context (see Magrini, \n1998). An extensive literature on the role of human capital in economic growth and the tendency for \ninnovation to be localised with respect to R&D has developed over the past ten years, so little \njustification seems necessary. They are reflected here by two variables. One used in previous work is the \nconcentration of the R&D facilities of large companies relative to population in each FUR. For some \nrecent evidence on the spatial diffusion of innovation see Barrios et al, 2007. The second is a new \nvariable, university students per employee.  Both these variables are measured for the start of the period \nto minimise problems of endogeneity. \n \nOur next hypothesis is that there is a relationship between systems of city government and city growth \nperformance: specifically that the more closely the administrative and functional boundaries of a city-\nregion correspond, the more likely it will be that effective local growth promotion policies develop. We \nconceive of \u2018growth promotion policies\u2019 in a much broader sense than as policies just designed to attract \nmobile investment. We would count as growth promotion policies: efficient public administration, \nreducing uncertainty and making decisions transparently and quickly; providing relevant infrastructure; \nmore effective co-ordination between public and private investment; providing relevant and effective \ntraining; and ensuring that land use policies are flexible and co-ordinated with infrastructure provision \nand the demands of private sector investors. They could also involve giving a higher priority to output \nand productivity growth compared to equity or environmental outcomes.  \n \nMore effective local growth promotion policies may not involve spending more, even on infrastructure, \nso a simple measure of local public expenditure is unlikely to capture the efficacy of growth promotion \nefforts even were such a variable available. Grand projects such as Bilbao\u2019s Guggenheim museum, \nLondon\u2019s Millennium Dome or a trophy metro system in Toulouse, are expensive but not necessarily \nproductive; efficient public administration and rapid public decision-making, clearly defined land use \npolicies and infrastructure planning, may cost less than their inefficient alternatives. \n \nAny \u2018output\u2019 of such policies \u2013 extra growth \u2013 is a local quasi-public good. It will be hard to exclude \nnon-contributing agents from any benefits policies generate: if policies paid for and implemented by the \ncentral city of a FUR increase output growth in its territory, it will be impossible to exclude commuters \nfrom surrounding jurisdictions from sharing the benefits, even though they pay no taxes within the \ncentral city. There will also be a zero opportunity cost in \u2018consumption\u2019 of any dividends the policy \nyields: if your rents rise, so do mine and that is not a cost to me; if your employment opportunities \nimprove that, too, is not a cost to mine. There is thus a classic problem of market failure so local growth \npromotion polices will be likely to be produced by government or some \u2018club\u2019 of actors, usually local \nand regional governments and private sector agencies in a public-private partnership. Such clubs face \nvarying problems of spillover losses and transaction costs. A proportion of the growth gains will leak \nout to agencies or residents of surrounding jurisdictions who are not members of the \u2018growth promotion \nclub\u2019. The relative size of such \u2018leaks\u2019 will vary with the size of the area the \u2018club\u2019 represents relative to \nthat of the whole FUR (which, as discussed, maximises the proportion of the benefits retained). The \ncloser the coincidence in the boundaries of the governmental unit within which such policies are \npursued with those of the economic region\/FUR within which their impact is largely contained, the \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 14 \nproportionately less will be these spillovers. In addition, the larger is the central unit of government \nrelative to the size of the self-contained FUR, the lower are likely to be the transactions costs in building \na \u2018growth promotion\u2019 club9. \n \nAny FUR is composed of one or more jurisdictions so a \u2018club\u2019 of jurisdictions (also usually including \nprivate sector actors) will have to be formed to implement growth promotion policies: in essence that is \nwhat regional development agencies are. If a \u2018club\u2019 forms it is reasonable to assume that the largest \njurisdiction within the FUR will always be a member. In our data set the largest jurisdiction in all FURs \nrepresents the historically oldest and central jurisdiction of the core or, in some cases, the whole core \ncity. The larger this is relative to the other jurisdictions within the FUR, the more dominant it is likely to \nbe and the more clout it will have; so the larger is the central jurisdiction relative to the FUR as a whole, \nthe lower are transactions costs likely to be. Whether an effective growth promotion club is formed for a \ncity-region is not, therefore, inevitable but will be conditioned primarily on the structure of the \nincentives faced by these governmental and other economic actors who might form a \u2018growth promotion \nclub\u2019.  \n \nEven if expenditures are very imperfectly related to outcomes, growth promotion policies cost resources \nand there will be transactions costs in forming and maintaining an effective club. The expected growth \ngains any club might achieve will vary with local circumstances and existing policies. The club\u2019s \nexpected gross payoff will be a direct function of the additional growth that a given club expects it can \ngenerate. Since a FUR\u2019s boundaries contain the maximum proportion of such benefits as might be \ngenerated by local growth promotion policies, for a given potential gross growth gain, the expected \npayoff for any growth club will fall as the size of its jurisdiction\/territory falls in relation to that of the \nrelevant FUR because the spillover losses to areas of the FUR not represented in the club increase. \nEqually, assuming other factors are constant, the expected net payoff would fall as the transactions costs \nincurred to form the club increase. Transactions costs will be positively related to the number of relevant \npotential members and the institutional dominance of the lead actor (which we can assume will be a \ngovernmental unit). Thus other things equal, expected net benefits will increase and transactions costs \nfall as the size of the largest effective governmental unit increases relative to the size of the FUR.  \n \nArguments such as these led Cheshire and Gordon (1996, page 389) to conclude that growth promotion \npolicies would be more likely to appear and be more energetically pursued where \u2018there are a smaller \nnumber of public agencies representing the functional economic region, with the boundaries of the \nhighest tier authority approximating to those of the region\u2026\u2019. \n \nWe can specify a variable closely reflecting this feature of FURs: the ratio of the total population of the \nlargest (relevant) jurisdiction representing the FUR to the population of the FUR as a whole. This will \nnormally be the jurisdiction with the largest population, representing the central administrative unit of \nthe FUR, but this is qualified by \u2018relevant\u2019: the jurisdiction must have significant powers of action. \nGiven the abolition of the Greater London Council in mid-period, the largest NUTS region with a \nterritory overlapping that of the London FUR during the period of our analysis was the South East \nRegion. But this was not a \u2018relevant\u2019 jurisdiction because it had essentially no powers10. The rules by \nwhich such \u2018relevant\u2019 local government units were identified were established before any models were \nestimated so that the variable could be defined blind of the data. These rules are set out in Appendix 1 \nand necessarily varied from country to country since the powers and structure of local governments vary \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 15 \nwidely across the EU. \n \nWe call this the \u2018policy incentive\u2019 variable because it is designed to measure the incentive to implement \npolicies promoting growth at the FUR level. Since one criterion used to select the \u2018relevant\u2019 \ngovernmental unit for each FUR was that it should have significant administrative and decision making \npowers, the Level 1 regions were potentially available for selection in countries with a regional level of \ngovernment. In practice, this meant that the value of the variable could range from only about 0.125 (in \nFrance) to over 2 (in Spain). We might further hypothesise that if the value of the variable were very \nhigh, so that the size of the \u2018relevant\u2019 unit of government substantially exceeded the size of the FUR, \nthen the incentive to generate growth promoting policies for the FUR might weaken. The interests of the \nFUR would begin to be lost in those of the larger unit which might favour rural areas or smaller centres. \nAs an illustration one might contrast Madrid, where the boundaries of the powerful regional government \nare only a little larger than those of the FUR with Aviles\/Gijon in Asturias. There the region is very \nmuch bigger than the FUR of Aviles\/Gijon and contains the smaller independent FUR of Oviedo. \nOviedo is not large enough to be in our data set but is the regional centre of government for Asturias. \nThus the growth policies of Aviles\/Gijon might actually suffer from the much larger size of the regional \njurisdiction containing it. This would imply a quadratic functional form with a maximum positive \nimpact for the policy incentive variable where the value was between 1 and 2.  \n \nTable 3 shows the results of adding variables to our \u2018base\u2019 model. Model 2 is directly comparable with \nthe OLS model reported in Table 2a but includes the additional variables to test the hypotheses \ndescribed above. The policy incentive variable is included in quadratic form but although the variable is \nsignificant the squared term is not. The variables measuring R&D activity and highly skilled human \ncapital are highly significant and the overall adjusted R\n2\n rises from 0.56 to 0.64. Full results of other \nmodels (for example, including the policy incentive in linear form and\/or a spatial lag) are available \nfrom the authors but the essential results are unchanged. \n \nTable 4 gives test statistics, including tests for spatial dependence. Two significant points emerge. The \nfirst is that there are no signs of classic econometric problems \u2013 multicollinearity, heteroskedasticity or \nnon-normality of errors. Spatial dependence is a potential problem, however. As is well known, a key \nissue in testing for spatial dependence is the specification of the \u2018proximity\u2019 of one observation to \nanother. There is no a priori basis for selecting distance weights. As is often the reality with applied \nwork, insight and experimentation are complementary. Our insight grew with experiment and tests were \nconducted using 28 different distance weight matrices, applying all the distance measures found in the \nliterature, including contiguity, crow-fly distance and road distance, in various formulations. Here, we \nreport only the results for distance measures which seem most reasonably to represent underlying spatial \nprocesses and which also induced the most measured sensitivity to spatial dependence.  \n \nTest statistic values for spatial dependence were highly sensitive to how distance was measured. We \ncould easily \u2018eliminate\u2019 indications of spatial dependence by just choosing a suitable measure of \n\u2018proximity\u2019. This, in itself, should be a warning but it suggested that a useful indicator of how to test for \nspatial dependence most rigorously was that the proximity measure made economic sense and indicated \nthe greatest problems, or most frequently indicated problems, of spatial dependence. Happily, measuring \ndistance as the inverse of time-distance between FURs, using the standard road freight software, \nincluding ferry crossings, not only seems to represent \u2018proximity\u2019 in an economically meaningful way \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 16 \nbut also always provided the greatest measured sensitivity to spatial dependence. Table 4 reports results \nfor two formulations \u2013 the inverse of time-distance and the inverse of time-distance squared.  \n \nTable 3: Dependent Variable Annualised Rate of Growth of GDP p.c.

Results for our preferred measure of proximity are perfectly acceptable for two \nrecommended test statistics, LM (error) and LM (lag), although the value of the Moran\u2019s I is suspect at \n10 percent. Cheshire and Magrini (2006) found that there was quality of life associated adjustment \nwithin but not between countries. The implication was that national borders represented substantial \nbarriers to spatial adjustment. This prompted us to include in the spatial weights matrix an additional \n\u2018time-distance penalty\u2019 for national borders. Here we have systematically tested border time-distance \npenalties from zero to infinity. The results were generally most sensitive to spatial dependence if \nnational borders were represented as an additional time-distance of 600 minutes. The test statistics for \nModel 2 illustrate this clearly. With that time penalty added to the distance weights matrix the key test \nstatistics for spatial dependence are significant. If an infinite time-distance penalty is imposed for \nnational borders then implied problems of spatial dependence are reduced. This implies that if \u2018distance\u2019 \nbetween FURs is represented in the most economically meaningful way, Model 2 really embodies \nproblems of spatial dependence. \n \nWe interpret these test results as indicating an underlying problem of omitted variables. We should not \nexpect the growth behaviour of a FUR to be independent of its neighbours; nor should we be surprised \nto discover that there are systematic differences in urban growth performance resulting from location. \n \nOur final set of variables is designed to test these explanations and further illuminate the drivers of \ndifferential urban economic growth rates. It has long been argued that location within Europe should \nhave systematic effects on patterns of spatial growth. From at least the contribution of Clark et al. \n(1969) there has been a powerful argument that the process of European integration systematically \nfavoured \u2018core regions\u2019 \u2013 those gaining most in terms of economic accessibility, the more centrally \nlocated. This provided the intellectual support for EU policies to reduce spatial disparities and develop \nstronger instruments of regional development as a complement to steps towards integration. More \nrecently, \u2018New Economic Geography\u2019 has produced formal models with essentially the same \nconclusions (see Fujita et al., 1999, for a survey).  \n \nAn early empirical attempt to estimate the spatial economic effects of European integration was the \ninfluential work of Clark et al. (1969). Using GDP data they estimated themselves for all regions for the \nyears 1960-64, Clarke et al (1969) estimated regional \u2018economic potential\u201911 for the six original \nmembers of the EEC and the then four candidate members, for three alternative states of the world: with \ntariffs at pre-Treaty of Rome levels; with all 10 countries having no tariffs on manufactures; and with no \ntariffs and two transport improvements \u2013 containerisation and roll-on roll-off ferries. Thus the change in \neconomic potential for each region associated with the reduction of trade and transport costs to be \nbrought about by European integration and anticipated technical progress provided a measure of these \nsystematic spatial economic impacts. The \u2018integration gain\u2019 variable used here is taken directly from \nClark et als\u2019 values, supplemented with the estimates for the regions of Spain and Portugal provided by \nKeeble et al. (1988), scaled to Clark et als\u2019 values. Values for Athens, Lisbon, Porto and Saliniki were \ninterpolated to provide coverage of all the major FURs of the EU of 12. Since our interest is in growth, \nwe use the change in the values of \u2018economic potential\u2019 from the pre-Treaty of Rome values to those \nestimated as being associated with an elimination of tariffs, the EU\u2019s enlargement of the 1980s and a \nreduction in transport costs following the introduction of roll-on roll-off ferries and containerisation. The \ntheoretical arguments as to why integration should favour core regions do not imply that the relationship \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 19 \nmeasured for the 1980s or the 1990s should necessarily be linear but experimentation suggested the \nlinear form reported here performed best in statistical terms. \n \nAs an additional variable to account for systematic spatial patterns in growth we include a \nstraightforward dummy for peripherality. There has been much discussion in the literature of the impact \nof peripherality. The \u2018integration gain\u2019 variable already accounts for the systematic effects of European \nintegration but peripheral regions may have common features (such as lower factor costs, for example). \nMore obviously, they have been recipients of regional aid from the EU. Although the impact of such aid \nhas been questioned (Midelfart and Overman, 2002, or Rodriguez-Pose and Fratesi, 2004) still it is \nunlikely to have been systematically negative. To avoid subjective judgements about what regions are \u2013 \nor are not \u2013 peripheral, this is formulated simply in terms of time-distance from Brussels: any FUR 600 \nminutes or more from Brussels is classified as peripheral.  \n \nModels 3 and 4 (see Table 3) include these variables. It will be seen that both are significant. There is an \napparent systematic integration gain effect. Perhaps more interesting is the fact that the peripherality \ndummy is not only significant but also positively signed. Offsetting for all other variables, including the \ndirect effects of \u2018integration gain\u2019, FURs more than 600 minutes from Brussels experienced faster \ngrowth in GDP p.c. than those nearer. Neither of these variables raises any significant endogeneity \nconcerns. \n \nModels 3 and 4 also include three variables (plus an additional control for the initial level of \nunemployment\n12\n) designed to reflect more localised spatial patterns of urban growth resulting from the \ninfluence of conditions in one city on the growth performance of its neighbour(s). Systematic \ninteractions between FURs\u2019 growth rates should decline with distance between them. In regions of \ndense urbanisation, such as the German Ruhr, Benelux countries, the British midlands or northern Italy, \none would expect the economic development of urban regions to be highly interdependent. The most \nobvious reason is the literature on labour market search behaviour and vacancy chains. If productivity, \nwages or job opportunities are relatively improving in one FUR, then economically active non-residents \nwho can access those opportunities at the lowest cost \u2013 who live nearest \u2013 will tend to do so. Migration \nis expensive but changes in commuting patterns respond to only small differences in opportunities \n(Gordon and Lamont, 1982 or Morrison, 2006). These variables are all measured as densities across the \nset of neighbouring FURs. In calculating the value of each density variable for any FURi the weight \nattached to the value of the variable in surrounding FURj-n is discounted by the inverse of time-distance \n(with the same 600 minute time-distance penalty for national borders as maximised the value of spatial \ndependence and an upper limit on time-distance to identify the members off the set FURj-n). This upper \nlimit was determined for each density variable by experiment but the results seem reasonable in terms of \neconomic behaviour. In all cases, the selected cut-offs worked best in an empirical sense: in the case of \nformulating the distance weights matrix to test for spatial dependence, they tended to produce the \ngreatest sensitivity to tests; in formulating the density variables to represent spatial adjustment \nprocesses, they produced the best results, both in terms of significance and eliminating indications of \nspatial dependence. \n \nThe first is the spatial density of unemployment. If a FUR\u2019s growth rate is negatively influenced by a \nconcentration of unemployment in it at the start of the period, then a concentration of unemployment in \nclosely surrounding FURs should also have a negative impact. Given the possibility of job search in \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 20 \nsurrounding areas we would expect higher unemployment not to be just localised, moreover, but if \nneighbouring FUR labour markets are accessible, we would expect unemployment rates for workers of \ncomparable skills to even out over the set of neighbouring FURs. Since job search areas and commuting \ndistances of the less skilled (over-represented among the unemployed) are relatively shorter, we should \nalso expect the influence of localised unemployment to be relatively short range and experiment showed \nthe best results were obtained applying a two hour time-distance to identify \u2018neighbouring\u2019 FURs. \n \nAs with job search, the literature on the spatial pattern of innovation shows a distance decay effect, with \npatents tending to be applied more frequently nearer to their point of origin. So, the impact of R&D with \nrespect to innovation is likely not to be purely localised but to be subject to a distance decay effect \n(Audretsch, 1998; Barrios et al, 2007). So R&D in one urban area should have some positive differential \nimpact on innovation and growth in neighbouring urban areas but that effect would diminish with \ndistance. An upper time-distance of 2.5 hours between FUR centroids to identify \u2018neighbouring\u2019 FURs \nworked best. This gives us our second spatial adjustment variable. \n \nThe third of these variables is the relative concentration of university students in neighbouring FURs at \nthe start of the period. An initially higher stock of university students within a given FUR directly \nincreases its growth performance (captured in our \u2018University Student\u2019 variable). Furthermore, this \nadditional growth will increase relative job opportunities and tend to suck in complementary labour, \nincluding high human capital labour, from surrounding FURs. Consequently, we expect a negative \nimpact on growth in a particular FUR of a stronger relative concentration of university students at the \nstart of the period in neighbouring FURs; moreover, we also expect the distance over which such an \neffect would be measured to be longer than with unemployment. As with the spatial effects of R&D \nconcentration, the best results were obtained if the cut off was set at 2.5 hours, to which was again added \na 600-minute national border time-distance penalty. \n \nThe results of including these variables to reflect systematic spatial patterns in FUR growth and spatial \nadjustment mechanisms between neighbouring FURs are set out in the final two columns of Table 3, \nwith the relevant diagnostic statistics in Table 4. The results for our \u2018policy incentive\u2019 variable are \nsignificant although the squared term is still not well defined - only significant at 10 percent. \nNevertheless, an F test shows that a quadratic functional form is significantly better at the 5 percent \nlevel. All other variables are significant at 5 percent and have the expected signs.  \n \nThe regression diagnostics indicate that there are none of the common econometric problems of cross \nsectional models. More interestingly, including the spatial variables eliminates any sign of spatial \ndependence. This supports our view that finding spatial dependence frequently derives from omitting \nvariables. We have formulated variables designed to measure factors leading to systematic spatial \npatterns in growth performance and interaction between neighbouring FURs and they are not only \nstatistically significant but eliminate all indications of spatial dependence. This suggests we should now \nnot only have consistent parameter estimates but better analytical insight into the drivers of urban \neconomic growth including how mechanisms of spatial adjustment modify growth performance in areas \nof denser urbanisation. \n \n \n \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 21 \nTable 5:  Growth Impact: effect on predicted growth of a change (+ or - 1sd) of an \nindependent variable  \n GROWTH IMPACT \n Model 4 \n + 1 std - 1 std \nPopulation Size 1.81% -1.81% \nPopulation Density  -1.34% 1.34% \nCoalfield: core -3.06% 3.06% \nCoalfield: hinterland -1.29% 1.29% \nPort Size * -2.68% 3.40% \nAgriculture * 3.74% -5.57% \nUnemployment  -1.70% 1.70% \nNational Non-FUR Growth 6.18% -6.18% \nPolicy Incentive * 2.97% -4.13% \nIntegration Gain 3.36% -3.36% \nPeripherality  4.16% -4.16% \nUniversity Students 1.92% -1.92% \nR&D Facilities 2.24% -2.24% \nUnemployment Density -1.26% 1.26% \nUniversity Students Density -2.69% 2.69% \nR&D Facilities Density 2.91% -2.91% \nNote:  * the effects of Port Size, Agriculture and the Policy Incentive variables are calculated through the estimated \nquadratic relationship \n \nFinally Table 5 shows the impact on growth performance of a change of one standard deviation in each \nindependent variable. Perhaps unsurprisingly the single greatest influence is the performance of the \neconomy outside the area of the major FURs. But other variables have substantial influence particularly \nwhen taken in groups of related variables such as those reflecting concentrations of R&D and highly \nskilled human capital or those relating to systematic spatial patterns and spatial interactions in densely \nurbanised areas of Europe. \n \n5. Conclusions \nOne conclusion is, therefore, that by including variables reflecting theoretically relevant spatial \nadjustment mechanisms it is possible effectively to eliminate problems of spatial dependence. So, a \nfinding of spatial dependence \u2013 at least in the context of recent patterns of European urban growth \u2013 \nlargely reflects model specification. If theoretically appropriate variables reflecting spatial processes are \nincluded, spatial dependence is eliminated. Testing for spatial dependence is itself, however, very \ndemanding. It was only when we realised the barrier that national borders represented for labour \nmobility (Cheshire and Magrini, 2006) and experimented with time penalties for national borders in the \ndistance weights matrix, that tests revealed any problems of spatial dependence in our models of GDP \np.c. growth.  \n \nModels 3 and 4 should provide consistent estimates and support the interpretation that they are a \nsufficiently good approximation of the underlying economic processes which generated our dependent \nvariable, FUR growth rates in real GDP p.c., to provide insight into causal processes \u2013 so we can \nconclude that the evidence supports the main hypotheses summarised in the introduction:  \n1. Local differences in human capital and R&D activity are important factors in explaining \ndifferential rates of urban economic growth; \n2. European integration has had a significant impact in accelerating growth in regions gaining most \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 22 \nin terms of economic potential \u2013 mainly \u2018core\u2019 regions \u2013 but at the same time, offsetting for all \nother factors including these systematic impacts of integration itself, peripheral regions, on \naverage, grew faster relative to the rest; and \n3. Administrative and government arrangements for cities systematically influence their economic \ngrowth performance. Where there is a jurisdiction approximating the boundaries of an \neconomically self-contained city-region, growth is stronger, other things equal. This is consistent \nwith the expectations conceptualising the promotion of growth as the provision of a local public \ngood and the resulting advantage in forming an effective \u2018growth promotion club\u2019 of local actors \nsince spillover losses and transactions costs are minimised. \n \nWe stress that policies encouraging local economic growth are not conceived as being just geared to \ninward investment nor even, necessarily, with explicitly promoting growth at all. They may consist of \nefficient local public administration, avoidance of waste and a focus on activities that government at an \nurban level can effectively influence, such as the supply of skills or infrastructure, rather than \nredistribution. We cannot measure these factors comparably across the urban areas of the EU as a \nwhole. The variable used in the present paper seems justified on theoretical grounds but is an indirect \nmeasure, reflecting not the policies themselves, but the incentive and capacity to generate such policies \nfaced by local actors. This variable is significant even in a very simple model but more fully specified \nmodels and further testing confirms its statistical significance and suggests a quadratic functional form. \nSo, for growth promotion, the optimal size of government areas associated with city-regions is perhaps a \nlittle larger than the area covered by the functional economic boundaries. \n \nThe results also support the conclusion of Cheshire and Magrini (2006) that an assumption of \u2018full \nspatial equilibrium\u2019 is not appropriate in Europe with its geographically immobile population. Moreover \nit also implies it is inappropriate to argue there is one unified European urban system. National borders \nstill represent significant obstacles. We only observe indications of spatial dependence if a substantial, \n600-minute, time-distance penalty is added where FURs are separated by national boundaries. A \ncomparable effect is revealed in specifying variables to reflect process of spatial interaction between \ngeographically neighbouring cities. Conditions in cities geographically close to each other \u2013 common in \ndensely urbanised Europe \u2013 do significantly influence economic growth patterns in each other: but not if \nthey are separated by a national border. Borders seem, for example, to eliminate the tendency for \ninnovations to be localised. The nature of our methodology, of course, does not allow us to discriminate \nso that is consistent with the barrier represented by a national border being greater in some contexts and \nless in others. The results, therefore, lend further support to the conclusion that in a European context of \nrestricted labour mobility and continuing national border effects, income growth rather than population \ngrowth is a more appropriate indicator of welfare improvements in a city.  \n \nThe empirical results also provide support for the theoretical work of Magrini (1998) on the significant \nrole of human capital in regional economic growth. In models investigating urban population growth \nneither concentrations of highly skilled nor of R&D establishments had any influence (Cheshire and \nMagrini, 2006). As drivers of economic growth we find they are highly significant.  It may be stretching \nour results rather far but this is consistent with self selection in migration with less productive workers \nmore influenced by climate (not significant in explaining difference in rates of economic growth) in \nchoosing where to live and the highly skilled by wages and employment opportunities. The results also \nprovide indirect evidence supporting the increased importance of agglomeration economies since the \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 23 \nlate 1970s and the negative impact on economic performance of increasing urban density. There was a \nsystematic tendency for larger cities to have a faster rate of economic growth but a negative effect \u2013 \nonce size and other factors were allowed for \u2013 of density. This is interesting in the debate about the \nsources of agglomeration economies since it implies that it is not density per se that is conduce to \nagglomeration economies but opportunities for productive interactions. While density rises with city \nsize it is a negative since it reduces the propensity for productive interactions other things equal by \nraising congestion and the price of space. \n \nThe results do not identify strong policy levers with which to boost a city\u2019s rate of growth. It does not \nfollow, for example, that if in the late 1970s every city had been endowed with the same proportion of \nuniversity students per employee they would all have grown at the same rate as the actually best \nendowed with universities did. While these differences were one factor in explaining growth differences \n\u2013 and that helps understand what was going on \u2013 there is no necessary symmetry about the impact of \ngiving all cities the same sized relative university sectors. It is probable that the unobserved \ncharacteristics of the cities with the highest ratios of university students were, and still are, different in \nimportant ways from cities with the lowest ratios; and were not independent of the concentration of \nuniversities in them. Nor is it possible to think in practical terms of providing all cities with equally high \nratios of university students per employee and maintaining a constant quality of university students (and \nstudents who then disproportionately join the local labour force).  \n \nIt is perhaps more plausible to think of the findings on the policy incentive variable as identifying a \n\u2018policy lever\u2019. Local and regional government boundaries and functions could be restructured and, if an \nimportant element of the disadvantage FURs with fragmented local government structures face in \neffectively promoting growth, results from spillovers and transaction costs, the outcome should be more \neffective policies all round. A problem is that, of course, \u2018effective\u2019 local growth promotion policies at \npresent, in circumstances in which not all city regions are equally well endowed with the incentive to \ndevelop them, may be significantly competitive and diversionary. Some local growth may be zero sum. \nThe success of cities endowed with beneficial systems of government may significantly be a function of \nthe poor performance of those less favourably placed. It does not follow that all policies designed to \npromote local growth are zero sum, however. It is reasonable to expect that there could be net efficiency \ngains for the EU\u2019s urban system as a whole if city government boundaries were aligned more closely \nwith those reflecting economically relevant patterns of behaviour and spatial economic organisation.  \n \nThis also should remind us of the limitations of the Tiebout hypothesis (1956). That is an important and \ninfluential idea but it is elaborated in a world in which local public policies have no spillovers beyond \nthe jurisdiction in which they are implemented and people are perfectly mobile. \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 24 \nReferences \nAnselin, L., Rey, S.J.

Elsewhere in France the central Commune was \nselected except for those FURs for which a Communit\u00e9 Urbaine exists; in \nthose cases the Communit\u00e9 Urbaine was selected \nGreece The central Municipality; \nIreland The County Borough (of Dublin); \nItaly The central Commune was selected in all cases. Unlike the situation in France \n(Paris) or Germany (Bremen and Hamburg) there is no NUTS 1 or 2 region \ncorresponding to any city nor is there any city with a city wide tier of \ngovernment (such as the Communit\u00e9 Urbaine). \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 27 \nThe Netherlands The central Municipality (as Italy); \nPortugal The central Municipality (as Italy); \nSpain Where there was one major FUR in a Communidad Autonoma (a NUTS 2 \nregion), the Communidad Autonoma was selected; where there was more than \none major FUR in the Communidad Autonoma but only one in the Provincia (a \nNUTS 3 region), the Provincia was selected; where there was more than one \nmajor FUR within a Provincia then the central Municipio was selected; \nUnited Kingdom In England, the District was selected except in London where Inner London \nwas used; in Scotland, the regions of Lothian and Strathclyde were taken and \nfor Belfast the NUTS 1 region of Northern Ireland was the government unit \nidentified. \n \nThe only case, then, for which no obvious rule was available, was that of London because of the \nabolition of London-wide government in the middle of the period. In 1985, local government powers \nwere re-assigned down to the 32 boroughs and up to committees of boroughs and to central government. \nThere were further changes to this system in the later part of the period when the Government Office for \nLondon was set up.  The only stable unit of government relating to London was the City of London or \nthe individual London boroughs but there was a regional authority \u2013 Greater London \u2013 for some of the \nperiod. The selection of Inner London - not really a governmental unit at all - represented no more than \nthe most reasonable compromise. We tested alternatives and as might be expected, substituting the value \nfor the largest borough or the GLC as a whole made no material difference to the results reported here. \n \n \nAppendix 1 Table 2: Sources for other data \nVariable  \nNumber \n \n1 National Censuses of population or \u2013 where unavailable \u2013 national registration data \n2 Area from administrative maps \n3 Oxford Regional Economic Atlas, Oxford: OUP, 1971 \n4 Oxford Regional Economic Atlas, Oxford: OUP, 1971 \n5 \nHanbusch der Europaischen Seehafen Band II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX & X Hamburg: \nVerlag Weltarchiv, various dates from 1968 \n6 Eurostat NUTS2 data \n7 Estimated from Eurostat NUTS3 data \n8 GDP data from Eurostat: see text for further explanation. \n9 See text and above for details. \n10 Estimated from Clark et al 1969 and Keeble et al 1988 \n11 Time distance measured using standard road freight software: Microsoft \n12 \nUniversity Students taken from The International Association of Universities, International \nHandbook of Universities, 1978, (seventh edition), London: The Macmillan Press; Association of \nCommonwealth Universities, Commonwealth University Yearbook 1979, 1978, (fifty-fifth \nedition) London: The Association of Commonwealth Universities; and The World of Learning \n1978-1979, 1978, (twenty-ninth edition), London: Europa Publications: total employment \nestimated from Eurostat data \n13 \nR&D laboratories of Fortune top 500 companies as reported in Directory of European Research, \nLondon: Longman, 1982  \n14 \nUnemployment as per variable 7: time-distances here and elsewhere from standard road freight \nsoftware - Microsoft. \n15 University Students as per variable 12: time-distance as elsewhere \n16 R&D Facilities  as per 13: time-distances as elsewhere \n \n \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 28 \nAppendix 1 Table 3: Descriptive Statistics \nVariable  Mean S.D.

This paper draws on work undertaken for a project within the ESRC\u2019s Cities Initiative under Award L 130251015 \nwhose support is gratefully acknowledged. \n2\n Tiebout (1956) is one of the most highly cited papers in local public finance and in applied urban economics. This \nanalyses a world in which people can vote with their feet for the package of local public goods and services which best \nsuits their incomes and preferences and shows that under the assumption of full spatial equilibrium and no local public \npolicy spillovers competition between local jurisdictions can produce optimal sets of local public goods. The issue here is \nthat in the context of European systems of local government we need to consider a world in which people are not \nperfectly mobile and there may be important classes of local public goods which have spatial spillovers associated with \ntheir consumption and\/or their production. \n3\n Now known as Core-Based Statistical Areas \u2013 or CBSAs. The responsibility for this system of urban definitions rests \nwith the Office of Management and Budget (2000). \n4\n As noted they are defined so as to include significant geographical concentrations of jobs and all residents who \ncommute to that employment centre. Thus in the short term all residents within a given FUR will benefit from \nemployment or income growth within it; and the boundaries of the FUR will include the great majority of potential \nbeneficiaries from growth. This is a \u2018short term\u2019 view and excludes induced migration in response to changing \nemployment prospects or wages and also excludes trade and capital flows.  Arguably growth promotion agencies are \nmotivated by short run factors (\u2018a week is a long time in politics\u2019); certainly results in the conceptual short run are likely \nto be extremely influential. But since no data are available for sub national trade or capital flows, from a practical point \nof view it is reasonable to argue that FURs are the closest spatial units to self-contained economic regions one can \nconstruct a data set for and are the most economically self-contained subdivisions of national territories which exist. \n5\n There are arguments both for and against using fixed boundaries. An argument against is that actual boundaries change \nover time as the location of employment and people changes. The impact of such changes has been investigated for a \nsubset of 25 FURs in the course of an INTERREG IIB Project (GEMACA, 2003). Details are available from the authors \nbut the range of changes in total population estimates for 1991 using first boundaries defined on 1971 employment and \ncommuting then boundaries defined on 1991 data was mainly from 5 to 10 percent. London was an outlier with \npopulation some 35 percent greater on its 1991 patterns of employment location and commuting. Changes in estimated \nemployment were always considerably smaller than for population. In practical terms we can anyway do no better than \nuse the fixed if obsolescent boundaries.  \n6\n Since 1999 a uniform statistical system for German Kreise \u2013 Level 3 regions \u2013 has been established, INKPAR, but this \nis too recent for our purposes. \n7\n The FUR of London used here was nearly 30% larger in population terms than the NUTS Level 1 region of Greater \nLondon. \n8\n To illustrate this process of estimation with the example of Bremen: the population of our FUR was divided between \nseven NUTS 3 regions for which we had Eurostat GDP p.c. data. In 1991, the proportionate distribution of Bremen\u2019s \npopulation between these NUTS regions was 0.4345, 0.1508, 0.1128, 0.0942, 0.0767, 0.0713 and 0.0597. These \nproportions were applied as weights to each of the seven NUTS regions\u2019 GDP p.c. to estimate the value of GDP p.c. for \nUrban Growth Drivers in a Continent of Sticky People and Implicit Boundaries \n \n 34 \n                                                                                                                                                                    \nthe FUR of Bremen.  We also have the proportionate distribution of FUR populations between NUTS 3 regions as at \n1981. The FUR data for any year were estimated using population weights calculated from national population censuses \nor registration data closest in time to that for which the Level 3 regions\u2019 data (e.g. GDP p.c.) related. \n9\n This may be somewhat simplified. There may be political or cultural links between some cities which are strong enough \nto lend some sense of joint enterprise to development efforts. Glaswegians may be happier with the thought of residents \nof Edinburgh sharing in their growth gains than might be the case, for example, between the citizens of Brussels and \nAntwerp. But even to the extent that this is true it might be regarded simply as statistically random noise and so not bias \nour proposed measure. \n10\n During the period analysed there was a South East Regional Planning Council (SERPLAN) but this was effectively no \nmore than a forum for discussion. \n11\n The concept of \u2018economic potential\u2019 is an old measure dating from the work of Harris (1954) and measures the \naccessibility to income (in Clark et al. measured as total GDP) at every point in space allowing for full costs of transport \nincluding, where appropriate, tariffs. \n12\n The impact of this control variable is modest and has no significant effect on the estimated value of other coefficients. \n \n \n  \n"}
