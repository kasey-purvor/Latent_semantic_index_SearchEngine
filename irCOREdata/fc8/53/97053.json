This is often described\nas \u2018somatic evolution\u2019 because it requires a sequence of heritable\ngenetic changes. Classical models of carcinogenesis, such as the\nFearon\u2013Vogelstein diagram (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990), consist\nof accumulating alterations in oncogenes, protooncogenes, tumour\nsuppressor genes, and senescence pathways that increase growth-\npromoting signals and decrease growth inhibitors.\nWe have proposed (Gatenby and Gillies, 2004) that traditional\nconceptual models do not completely capture the underlying\nDarwinian dynamics because they implicitly assume that the\nselective pressures are internal to the cells themselves, for example\nresistance to apoptosis. Hence, they rarely define the specific\nmicroenvironmental selection forces and their dynamical interac-\ntions with cellular phenotypic properties, which is a fundamental\nrequirement of a complete model. This led to application of formal\nevolutionary mathematical models to carcinogenesis in an effort\nto define specific environmental selection forces and their\ninteractions with a range of cellular phenotypes. Model simula-\ntions demonstrated a previously unknown era of carcinogenesis\ndominated by hypoxia (Gatenby and Vincent, 2003; Gatenby et al,\n2005). This has led to the hypothesis that adaptation of hypoxia\nand acidosis are necessary steps in the later phase of the\ncarcinogenesis sequence (Figure 1).\nThe proposal is based on recognition that somatic evolution of\nepithelial cancers occurs entirely within a space contained by a\nbasement membrane. This anatomic constraint results in separa-\ntion of the evolving tumour cells from the underlying stroma\nincluding blood vessels so that carcinogenesis occurs in an\navascular environment. This enforces diffusion-reaction kinetics\nthat limits substrate delivery to and metabolite removal from\ntumour cells as proliferation carries them progressively into the\nlumen. As a result, tumour cell proliferation even following\nmultiple oncogene and tumour suppressor gene mutations may be\nlimited by regional variations in oxygen, glucose, and H\u00fe . In the\nproposed carcinogenesis model, cellular adaptations to these\nenvironmental selection forces drive additional somatic evolution\nthat is necessary for formation of an invasive cancer. Specifically,\nregional hypoxia promotes upregulation of glycolysis to maintain\nATP production despite hypoxia, and acidosis promotes upregula-\ntion of Na\u00fe \/H\u00fe exchangers (NHEs) or mutations in apoptotic\npathways to reduce acid-mediated toxicity (Park et al, 1999;\nWilliams et al, 1999).\nReceived 20 April 2007; revised 6 July 2007; accepted 10 July 2007;\npublished online 7 August 2007\n*Correspondence: RA Gatenby, Department of Radiology, University\nMedical Center, 1501 North Campbell Avenue, Tucson, AR 85724, USA;\nE-mail: rgatenby@radiology.arizona.edu\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2007) 97, 646 \u2013 653\n& 2007 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved 0007 \u2013 0920\/07 $30.00\nwww.bjcancer.com\nT\nra\nn\nsla\ntio\nn\na\nl\nT\nh\ne\nra\np\ne\nu\ntic\ns\nWe propose that the final outcome of this evolutionary sequence\nis a population with constitutive upregulation of glycolysis and\nthe ability to survive and proliferate in acidic conditions that\nwould ordinarily induce quiescence or death. This constitutes a\nsignificant adaptive advantage because the phenotype creates an\nacidic environment (through upregulation of glycolysis) that is\ntoxic to its competitors but less so to itself. We propose that this\nadaptive advantage promotes clonal expansion and invasive\nbehaviour and that these adaptations are necessary for evolution\nof invasive epithelial cancers. The legacy of these evolutionary\nevents is aerobic glycolysis (Warburg, 1930; Cherk et al, 2006)\nmanifested by increased glucose uptake observed in FdG PET (F18-\nFluorodeoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography) scans in\nthe overwhelming majority of primary and metastatic human\ncancers (Czernin and Phelps, 2002; Gambhir, 2002).\nThis conceptual model is supported by experimental observa-\ntions of upregulation of cellular responses to hypoxia in regions of\nDCIS most distant from the basement membrane. This includes\nupregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and related\nproteins such as carbonic anhydrase IX and GLUT-1 (Wykoff\net al, 2001; Brown et al, 2002). Furthermore, in vivo studies with\nFdG PET have demonstrated the transition from DCIS to invasive\nTumour\nstage\nA\nB\nNormal\nepithelium\nInterstitial\nneoplasia\nCarcinoma\nin situ\nInvasive\ncarcinoma\nMetastatic\ndisease\nPhysiological\nstate\nInitiation Intermittant\nhypoxia\nHIF1\u0001\nstabilisation\nGlycolytic\nphenotype\nAcidosis Motility Degradation of\nbasement\nmembrane and \nvascularisation\nVEGF\nSelectionMetabolismInductionSelectionProliferationProcess\nModel\nGlucose diffusion limit\nO2 diffusion limit\nBasement\nmembrane\nBlood vessel\nStroma\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1N\nor\nm\na\nliz\ne\nd \ngl\nuc\nos\ne \nan\nd \nox\nyg\nen\n c\non\nce\nnt\nra\ntio\nn\nN\nor\nm\na\nliz\ne\nd \nH+\n \nco\nn\nce\nn\ntra\ntio\nn\n0.0\n0\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n5 10\nDistance from basement membrane in cell diameters\nO2\nH+\nGlucose\n15 20 25\nFigure 1 (A) (from Gatenby and Gillies (2004) with permission). The evolution of breast cancer over time is shown left to right. Initial heritable changes in\noncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, and senescent pathways result in unconstrained proliferation into the lumen and away from the basement membrane.\nHowever, since the cells remain separated from their blood supply by the intact basement membrane, proliferation is eventually limited by hypoxia. This\npromotes a switch to glycolytic metabolism that eventually becomes fixed due to normoxic\u2013hypoxic cycles. The glycolysis leads to increased extracellular\nacid concentrations that produces toxicity through apoptosis and necrosis. This promotes evolution of a phenotype resistant to acid-induced toxicity. This\npopulation rapidly expands because it creates an environment that (1) is toxic to other populations that remain vulnerable to acid-induced toxicity and (2)\npromotes invasion. We hypothesise that this allows the population to breech the basement membrane and form an invasive cancer. Note that the original\nmodel assumed central tumour necrosis was caused by a decrease in glucose concentration. The model simulation\u2019s lower panel, however, demonstrates\nthat this component of the hypothesis is incorrect since small declines in glucose concentrations are observed. Instead, it appears that central necrosis is due\nto a combination of hypoxia and acidosis. (B) Oxygen, glucose, and H\u00fe concentrations in DCIS based on diffusion reaction mathematical models; y-axis is\nnormalised concentrations and x-axis is distance from the basement membrane in cell diameters (assuming a typical diameter of 25 mm). Oxygen\nconcentrations (red line) decline steeply with distance from the basement membrane resulting in severe hypoxia in regions only 5\u201310 cell layers from the\nmembrane. Despite upregulation of glycolysis, glucose concentrations (green line) decline only modestly with distance. A steep increase in H\u00fe\nconcentrations is observed (blue line). This predicts hypoxia and acidosis will be commonly observed in ductal tumours greater than about 250 mm in\ndiameter. However, proliferation should not be limited by glucose concentrations.\nHypoxia and acidosis in breast carcinogenesis\nRA Gatenby et al\n647\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2007) 97(5), 646 \u2013 653& 2007 Cancer Research UK\nT\nra\nn\nsl\na\nti\no\nn\na\nl\nT\nh\ne\nra\np\ne\nu\nti\nc\ns\nbreast cancer and colonic polyps to invasive colon cancers are\ninvariably associated with a marked increase in tumour glucose\nuptake (Yasuda et al, 2001; Abbey et al, 2005).\nExplicit testing of the hypothesis in breast cancer through\ncontinuous observation of premalignant lesions in vivo is not\nfeasible. Therefore, we initially examined our hypothesis using\nmathematical models to reproduce the nonlinear intra- and\nextracellular dynamics. Modelling simulations were then compared\nto cellular evolution in hypoxia and acidic regions of large (5\u2013\n10 mm in diameter) multicellular spheroids maintained in culture\nfor 30 days. The diffusion reaction kinetics of spheroids mimics\nthose of intraductal tumour. To detect evolution of constitutive\nupregulation of glycolysis, we stained specimens for GLUT-1 since\nprior studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between\nGLUT-1 expression and increased glucose flux as measured by FdG\nPET (Brown et al, 1996, 2002). The presence of regional acidosis\nwas defined by increased expression of NHE-1, which is primarily\nresponsible for extrusion of H\u00fe ions in MCF-7 and other breast\ncancer-derived populations (Bischof et al, 1996; Turturro et al,\n2004). Finally, we examined clinical specimens of DCIS and\ninvasive cancer to detect evidence for cellular response to hypoxia\nand acidosis similar to those predicted in the mathematical models\nand observed in the spheroids.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMathematical modelling\nA hybrid cellular automaton model (Patel et al, 2001; Anderson,\n2005; Smallbone et al, 2005) is used to simulate carcinogenesis on\na mucosal surface in which the mutant cells are separated from\nthe blood supply by an intact basement membrane. This two-\ndimensional model is composed of an array of automaton elements\nwith a specific rule-set governing their evolution, as well as oxygen,\nglucose, and H\u00fe fields, each satisfying reaction-diffusion equa-\ntions. Each automaton element corresponds to a normal cell,\ntumour cell, or a vacant space. Although normal and tumour\nepithelial cell diameter is variable, we assume each automaton\nelement, and hence each tumour cell has constant diameter of\n25mm. A detailed description of the mathematical methods has\nbeen published (Smallbone et al, 2006). The mathematically\ninclined reader is referred to that publication and the Supplemen-\ntary Appendix for a full accounting of these results.\nBriefly, the model reproduces the geometry of epithelial surfaces\nby assuming that the bottom edge of the array represents the\nbasement membrane. Beyond the membrane we assume the\nstroma is sufficiently well-vascularised such that oxygen and\nglucose concentrations as well as pHe remain fixed at their normal\nextracellular values.\nInitially, the automaton consists of a layer of a normal epithelial\ntissue and is vacant elsewhere. We assume it to be normal\nepithelium growing in a monolayer along the basement membrane.\nCellular metabolism in the normal epithelial layer is aerobic since\nthe cell layer possesses a normal oxygen concentration. Similarly\nlocal pHe is physiologic (i.e. 7.4). Cells will undergo proliferation\nand death in response to microenvironmental and intracellular\nconditions. If oxygen and glucose concentrations are too low,\nthen the cellular production of ATP drops below maintenance\nrequirements and the cell undergoes apoptosis. Similarly, cells\nundergo apoptosis in response to an acidic pHe or randomly due to\nsenescence or loss of contact with the basement membrane.\nConversely, cells that have sufficient ATP (and an adjacent site is\nunoccupied) may proliferate to fill that site.\nTo initiate carcinogenesis, we assume that the cells may begin\nto randomly undergo three possible heritable changes through\nmutations or epigenetic changes. Possible cellular phenotypic\nproperties include:\nNormal These cells proliferate under normal tissue controls so\nthat, for example, they undergo death from senescence and\napoptosis when no longer in contact with the basement membrane.\nThus, cellular proliferation is limited to replacement of sites that\nare vacant due to cell death. This phenotype typically uses aerobic\nmetabolism of glucose but may use anaerobic glucose metabolism\nso that ATP production continues (although at a lesser rate) under\nhypoxic conditions. The population has limited tolerance for\nacidic pHe and is assumed to undergo apoptosis at pHe of less\nthan 6.8.\nProliferative This phenotype is released from normal tissue\ngrowth constraints. This is meant to mimic mutations in\noncogenes, senescent pathways, and tumour suppressor genes in\nconventional carcinogenesis models. It allows proliferation even\nwhen not in contact with the basement membrane (i.e. anoikis-\nresistance) and increased crowding (i.e. resistance to contact\ninhibition). For purposes of analysis, we assume that these changes\ndo not alter metabolism or the toxic effects of hypoxia or acidosis;\nwe acknowledge, however, that mutations in some genes (such as\nc-myc) will have dual effects on both proliferation and cellular\nmetabolism.\nGlycolytic These cells have constitutive upregulation of glycolysis\nwith consequent increase in glucose uptake and acid production\nunder all conditions including normoxia.\nAcid-resistant These cells proliferate under local pHe conditions\nthat would produce apoptosis in normal cells. Mechanisms for\nincreased tolerance may include mutations in apoptotic pathways\n(such as caspase or p53) or upregulation of NHE-1.\nThese mutations give rise to eight non-normal phenotype\ncombinations, and thus eight competing cellular populations and\nmultiple potential evolutionary pathways.\nTumour spheroids\nWe tested the predictions of the model using large tumour\nspheroids that recapitulate the diffusion reaction dynamics of\nsubstrate delivery and metabolite excretion. By maintaining the\nspheroids in microgravity (Doolin et al, 1999; Clejan et al, 2001;\nDabos et al, 2001), we find they reliably achieve diameters of\n5\u201310 mm. This size has three advantages: (1) it is similar to the\ndiameter of many clinical lobular and ductal carcinoma in situ\ntumours; (2) it is much greater than the predicted diffusion limit of\noxygen so that central regions of hypoxia and acidosis will develop;\n(3) it contains a larger number of cells than conventional\nspheroids, increasing the probability that evolution driven by rare\nmutations will be manifested during the 30-day observation\nperiod.\nTo observe specific evolutionary patterns predicted by the\nmathematical models, we studied MCF-7 cell line because it\npossesses two of the three heritable attributes used in the\nmathematical models: (1) it is hyperproliferative (e.g. it exhibits\nanchorage independent growth (Zugmaier et al, 1991)) and (2) it is\nresistant to acid-induced toxicity such that it remains proliferative\nin culture conditions even at pH of 6.5 (Figure 2). Under normal\nculture conditions, however, the MCF-7 cells do not exhibit\nconstitutively upregulated glycolysis (Figure 2). Because of these\nphenotypic properties, we anticipate that under hypoxic and acidic\nconditions, MCF-7 cells will evolve phenotypes with constitutive\nupregulation of glycolysis, and that growth of these populations\nwill exhibit a distinctive pattern predicted by model simulations\n(Figure 2, lower row) with focal nodules of glycolytic cells growing\nin the normoxic region of the spheroid. Finally, MUC-1 stains\nof MCF-7 spheroids demonstrated a basement membrane-like\nstructure around the outer edge, further recapitulating ductal\nanatomy.\nHypoxia and acidosis in breast carcinogenesis\nRA Gatenby et al\n648\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2007) 97(5), 646 \u2013 653 & 2007 Cancer Research UK\nT\nra\nn\nsla\ntio\nn\na\nl\nT\nh\ne\nra\np\ne\nu\ntic\ns\nThe spheroids were formed as follows: Confluent cell mono-\nlayers were incubated with 0.25% (w\/v) trypsin (Sigma, UK) and\n0.02% (w\/v) EDTA (Sigma, UK) for 4 min at 371C. Complete media\nwere added to this mixture to inhibit enzyme activity. The cell\nsuspension was passed through a 24-gauge needle, six times to\nensure a single cell population. A 10 ml High Aspect Ratio Vessel\n(HARV; Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA) was seeded at 2\u0002 106\ncells ml\u00031 in a Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS, Austin, TX,\nUSA) rotated at 15 r.p.m. at 371C in a humidified atmosphere of\n5% CO2 in air. The rotation speed allowed the formed aggregates\nto remain stationary relative to the observer. The media in the\nHARVs was replenished 50 : 50 every other day. A constant\nconcentration gradient was obtained by continuous stirring of\nthe media.\nSpheroids were removed 1, 15, and 30 days after initiation. Each\nspheroid was fixed and stained for GLUT-1 and NHE-1.\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemical staining for glucose transporter GLUT-1\nwas performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody against the\nC-terminal portion (Abcam, inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). The\nNHE-1 antibody is a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\nThe formalin fixed, paraffin embedded spheroids were sectioned\nat 3 mm and baked for one hour at 601C. Immunohistochemistry\nwas performed using the Discovery XT Automated Staining\nplatform (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc, Tucson, AR, USA).\nDeparaffinisation and antigen retrieval of tissue sections was\nperformed online. Antigen retrieval was performed on the Ventana\ninstrument with a borate buffer (pH 8) 40 min at 951C. Once the\ntissue is conditioned in this way, several blocking steps occur on\nthe instrument. Primary antibody is applied by hand at a 1 : 800\ndilution. (60 min incubation at 371C). Primary antibodies were\nvisualised using VMSI validated detection and counterstaining\nreagents. Images were captured using an Olympus BX50 camera\nwith an RT SPOT (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights,\nMI, USA). Images were standardised for light intensity. Staining\nwas performed with primary antibody in the spheroids and clinical\nspecimens as negative controls. In GLUT-1 staining of clinical\nspecimens, red blood cells were used as positive controls.\nClinical specimens\nPathological specimens from 20 breast biopsies containing DCIS\nwere subjected to immunohistochemical stains with IRB approval.\nOf these, five also contained regions of microscopic or\ngross invasive cancer. Eight of the specimens were also stained\nfor NHE-1. In this study, we were interested in finding evidence for\nFigure 2 Simulations from the mathematical model described in the text showing potential evolutionary pathways in carcinoma in situ. Simulations start\nwith a single layer of normal epithelial cells (grey cells) on a basement membrane (A). All simulations found that initial growth occurred only when mutations\nproduced a hyperproliferative phenotype (pink cells) (B) through mutations in oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, etc. Growth into the lumen eventually\nceased, however, due to hypoxia and acidosis (Figure 1B). Without additional cellular evolution, this population remains limited. Additional growth occurred\nfollowing two possible sequences: (1) heritable changes that upregulate glycolysis. This population with constitutive upregulation (green cells) (C) allow this\nnew population to replace the hyperplastic cells and to extend further into the lumen. However, clonal expansion is eventually limited by acid-mediated\ntoxicity. This promotes evolution of a glycolytic, acid-resistant phenotype (yellow cells) which rapidly replaces all other extant populations in a highly\naggressive, infiltrative pattern extending to the basement membrane and farther into the lumen (D). (2) A second pathway begins with development of an\nacid-resistant population (blue cells). This population expands and replaces many of the hyperplastic population (E) but growth remains limited by hypoxia\npromoting emergence of a phenotype with upregulated glycolysis and acid resistance (yellow cells) identical to the population in (C). However, unlike in (C),\nthis phenotype initially grows into the normoxic region forming nodules of varying size (F). These eventually coalesce into a pattern essentially identical to\nthe appearance in (D).\nHypoxia and acidosis in breast carcinogenesis\nRA Gatenby et al\n649\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2007) 97(5), 646 \u2013 653& 2007 Cancer Research UK\nT\nra\nn\nsl\na\nti\no\nn\na\nl\nT\nh\ne\nra\np\ne\nu\nti\nc\ns\nphenotypic adaptation to hypoxia and acidosis rather than the\nmechanism (i.e. activation of HIF, myc, akt, or some other\npathway). For this reason, immunohistochemical analysis for\noverexpression of those pathways was not included in the\nprotocols.\nRESULTS\nModelling\nThe model simulation demonstrates that, dependent on oxygen\nconsumption and cells size, significant hypoxia and acidosis will\noccur in DCIS within about 100 mm of the basement membrane\n(Figure 1). This is somewhat less than the 160 mm predicted by\nThomlinson and Gray (1955) or shown by Helmlinger et al (1997)\nand may have been a consequence of the dimensionality. While the\ncurrent simulations assumed a line source of oxygen, the above\nmeasurements were performed in vivo and thus oxygen could\ncome from multiple sources.\nSince 100 mm represent only about five cell layers, it is clear that\nhypoxia will typically occur in any large (i.e. several mm in\ndiameter) tumour-filled breast duct or lobule. This is consistent\nwith prior studies showing increased carbonic anhydrase IX\nexpression (indicating hypoxia and acidosis) is typically observed\nin central regions of DCIS (Wykoff et al, 2001). An unexpected\nfinding of the simulation was the steep increase in H\u00fe\nconcentrations within the hypoxic regions. This is in distinction\nto the glucose concentrations that decrease only slightly. Thus, the\nsimulations indicate that growth inhibition and ultimately necrosis\nin the central regions of DCIS is the result of both hypoxia and\nacidosis, and that reduced glucose concentration probably does\nnot play a role. This requires a change in our original hypothesis\n(Gatenby and Gillies, 2004) which assumed central necrosis in\nDCIS was caused by limited glucose diffusion.\nThe simulations demonstrate that anaerobic metabolism com-\npensates for decreased efficiency in ATP production with increased\nglucose flux. This adaptation, in turn, requires increased expression\nof membrane glucose transporters. Interestingly, we find that, even\nin the presence of oxygen, the anaerobic phenotype produces ATP\nat a slightly greater rate than aerobic metabolism. This slight\nadvantage, however, is negated under aerobic conditions by the\nincreased acid production that results in toxicity and, therefore,\ndecreases cellular fitness. Under hypoxic conditions, the advantage\nof anaerobic metabolism greatly increases because it can maintain\nnormal ATP production while it decreases considerably in the\nnormal (aerobic) phenotype. Interestingly this suggests that acid-\ninduced toxicity may serve as an important mechanism by which\nmulticellular tissue enforces aerobic metabolism on individual cells.\nFigure 2 shows temporal evolutionary patterns observed in\nmodel simulations. Initially, normal epithelial cells (grey) line the\nbasement membrane. In the first stage of carcinogenesis, only\nthose mutations that resulted in a relaxation of normal cell\u2013 cell\ngrowth constraints (pink) allowed growth. Mutations that changed\nglucose metabolism or acid tolerance conferred no proliferative\nadvantage so that neither phenotypic trait was maintained in the\nintraductal populations.\nThe simulations demonstrate that alteration in growth regula-\ntors are necessary but not sufficient to form a cancer because\nproliferation eventually ceases as clonal expansion moves cells\nfurther into the lumen. This results in cessation of growth by\nhypoxia and acidosis.\nDuring multiple simulations, cellular adaptation to these\nenvironmental selection forces followed two evolutionary pathways.\nIn one (Figure 3, middle row), the glycolytic phenotype occurs\nfirst and becomes dominant (green). This population because of\nits increased expression of glucose transporters and increased\nglycolytic capacity produces substantially more ATP in hypoxic\nconditions and, so, has a competitive advantage. As demonstrated\nin Figure 3, the glycolytic cells replace the hyperplastic population\nin the hypoxic tumour regions. Note, however, that the total\nnumber of cells within the system has decreased because the\nincreased glycolysis has resulted in higher levels of acidity, in turn\ninducing cell death. Further adaptation occurs to an acid-resistant\nphenotype (Figure 3, middle right). This population expands\nrapidly replacing the normal, hyperplastic, and hyperplastic plus\nglycolytic populations and invades into the normoxic region. This\nis because the population continues to use glycolytic pathways and\nproduce local acidosis even in the presence of oxygen causing all\ncells with normal acid tolerance to die off.\nThe second evolutionary pathway begins with emergence of the\nacid-resistant phenotype (blue cells in Figure 2 lower row). This\nallows proliferation in the acidic regions (which are also hypoxic),\nthus, confers a proliferative advantage permitting population\nexpansion. A subsequent mutation that increases glycolysis generates\nmore ATP allowing this population to expand initially in the\nhypoxic region. However, this phenotype appears to have only a\nmodest adaptive advantage compared to the glycolytic, proliferative\nphenotype. This produces slow population growth in a distinctive\nnodular pattern as demonstrated in Figure 3 (lower right panel).\nSpheroids\nAll three spheroids harvested at day 1 exhibited evidence of\nhypoxia in the core with upregulation of GLUT-1 in cells about\n100\u2013 50 mm from the edge representing an adaptation to hypoxia\n(Figure 4). Staining for NHE-1 was observed throughout all of the\ncells of the spheroid at all time points so that there was no evidence\nof regional or temporal variations in NHE-1 (Figure 4). In two (of\nthree) spheroids harvested at day 15 following initiation and two\n(of three) spheroids harvested at day 30, cells exhibiting increased\nGLUT-1 were observed in the periphery of the spheroid (Figure 4)\nwhich is normoxic base on both the simulations and the absence\nof increased GLUT 1 expression on the spheroids at day 1. In each\nspheroid, the nodules varied in size \u2013 a pattern remarkably similar\nto the model simulations. GLUT-1 and HIF-1a were co-expressed\n(not shown) indicating that increased glycolysis was regulated by\nstabilisation of HIF-1a.\nClinical specimens\nTwenty clinical specimens with DCIS were reviewed for evidence of\ncellular adaptations predicted by the mathematical model and\nCe\nll n\nu\nm\nbe\nr\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nA B\nNormoxia\nHypoxia\nControl\npH 6.5\nAnoxia\nG\nlu\nco\nse\n c\non\nsu\nm\npt\nio\nn\n(\u0002m\no\nl\/m\nin\n\u2013\n1 \/m\ng \npr\not\nei\nn\u2013\n1 )\n120\n90\n60\n30\n0\nMCF-7 MCF-710T 10A\nFigure 3 (A) Cultured MCF-7 cells exhibit a low level of glucose\nmetabolism under normoxic conditions.

In all but one of the samples, tumour cells\nwith upregulated GLUT-1 were observed in at least some regions of\nDCIS. In all 19 samples, increased GLUT-1 expression was present\nin the central regions of intraductal tumours (Figure 5). In 17 of 19\nspecimens cells with upregulated GLUT-1 were also observed in\nthe peripheral (presumably normoxic regions) of some of the\nintraductal tumours. In all of these cases, the cells formed clusters\nsimilar in pattern to the model simulations and spheroids\nsuggesting that adaptation to acidosis typically precedes constitu-\ntive upregulation of glycolysis. This differs from the modelling\nresults in which upregulated glycolysis preceded development of\nacid resistance in most simulation. The reason for this will be the\nsubject of further study.\nIn four specimens, a focus of microinvasive tumour was\nobserved adjacent to a tumour-filled duct. In each of these cases,\nthe cells in the invasive tumour demonstrated upregulated GLUT-1\nas did the cells in the periphery of the DCIS immediately adjacent\nto the focus of microinvasion. Upregulation of GLUT-1 was\nobserved in cells within four of five invasive cancers (Figure 5).\nThe cellular expression of GLUT-1 was often both membranous\nand cytoplasmic \u2013 a pattern previously observed (Brown et al,\n2002).\nRegions of cells with increased expression of NHE-1 were\nobserved in all eight specimens examined (Figure 6). In DCIS, the\ndistribution typically showed areas of increased expression both\ncentrally and in the periphery. Distinctive nodules such as those\nseen in GLUT-1 distribution were not observed. In the four cases\nof microinvasion, upregulated NHE1 expression was observed\nboth in the invasive cells and in the DCIS cells immediately\nadjacent to the foci of microinvasion. In all three cases of invasive\ncancer examined, NHE-1 was upregulated diffusely in the tumour\ncells.\nDISCUSSION\nWe propose regional variations in substrate and metabolite\nconcentrations in DCIS initiate cellular adaptations necessary for\nemergence of invasive breast cancer (Gatenby and Gillies, 2004).\nThe hypothesis is framed mathematically using a modified cellular\nautomata approach. The reaction\u2013diffusion simulations support a\nkey element of the hypothesis by demonstrating severe hypoxia\nwithin about five cell layers of the basement membrane in DCIS.\nHowever, the results do not support the original hypothesis that\na decrease in glucose concentrations leads to central necrosis.\nRather, we find that glucose concentrations decline only mildly\nwith distance from the basement membrane while acid concentra-\ntions increase more than originally expected.

The latter is necessary for breeching the basement\nmembrane and transition to invasive cancer.\nThe model simulations predict a distinctive pattern of nodular\ngrowth when populations with constitutively increased glycolysis\nemerge following mutations in a dominant population that is acid\nresistant.\nWe examined this prediction by observing the evolutionary\ndynamics of MCF-7 cells growing in spheroids under microgravity\nconditions. The spheroids, which measure 5 \u201310 mm in diameter,\nmimic the diffusion reaction kinetics in DCIS. At baseline, the\nMCF-7 cells are resistant to acid-induced toxicity but do not\nexhibit constitutive upregulation of glycolysis. We demonstrate\nevolutionary dynamics in which upregulation of GLUT-1 is\ninitially observed only as an adaptation to hypoxia. Over time,\npopulations of GLUT-1-positive cells are observed invading into\nthe peripheral normoxic regions of the spheroids. The prolifera-\ntion of clones of cells with upregulated GLUT-1 under physiologic\nconditions is consistent with our hypothesis that this phenotype\nconfers a proliferative advantage. The nodular growth pattern is\nremarkably similar to the modelling predictions also supporting\nthis hypothesis. Demonstration of a proliferative advantage to the\nglycolytic phenotype even under normoxic conditions provides a\nFigure 5 Examples of GLUT-1 distribution in DCIS and invasive breast cancer.

(D) Show populations of cells with increased GLUT-1 expression in the periphery of DCIS adjacent to foci of microinvasion in which the cells also\nhave increased GLUT-1 expression.

Some cells with\nstrongly increased NHE-1 expression, however, are extending into the normoxic region where there is a focal bulge into the basement membrane. In (B),\nthere is a population of cells exhibiting increased NHE-1 expression in the periphery of DCIS adjacent to a focus of microinvasion which also exhibits\nincreased expression of NHE-1.

In addition, in 17 of 20 cases,\nwe also observed some populations with upregulated GLUT-1\nin the peripheral, normoxic regions of DCIS. Regions of increased\nNHE-1 expression were also observed in all of the DCIS specimens\nexamined. The results are consistent with our hypothesis\nthat hypoxia and acidosis occur frequently in DCIS, and\nthat cellular adaptations confer an adaptive advantage that\nallows subsequent spread into regions that are normoxic with\nnormal pHe.\nAll of the invasive cancers examined demonstrated cells with\nincreased NHE-1 expression and four of five contained cells with\nupregulated GLUT-1. The latter value is slightly greater than the\n61% of invasive cancers with increased GLUT-1 previously\nreported (Brown et al, 2002). These results support the hypothesis\nthat the glycolytic, acid-resistant phenotype is important in\ntransition from DCIS to invasive cancer. The absence of universal\nobservation of upregulation GLUT-1 in invasive cancer may\nindicate that aerobic glycolysis is not always necessary for invasive\nphenotype. Alternatively, some breast cancer populations may\nmaintain increased glycolysis through upregulated of GLUT-3 or\nuse fatty acids rather than glucose as their dominant carbon source\n(Liu, 2006).\nThere are several limitations in the current study. We cannot\nwith certainty know that the peripheral regions of the DCIS lesions\nare uniformly well oxygenated and, thus, it is possible that\nupregulation of GLUT1 and NHE-1 are adaptive (to regional\nhypoxia) rather than constitutive. Furthermore, the sample size is\nrelatively small and the data descriptive and non-quantitative.\nFinally, we do not know if similar dynamics are seen in other\npremalignant lesions such as colon adenomas. However, the\nempirical results in combination with the mathematical modelling\nsimulations do support the hypothesis that the hypoxia \u2013glyco-\nlysis\u2013acidosis cycle does occur in somatic evolution of breast\ncancer and that further investigation is warranted.\nSupplementary Information accompanies the paper on British\nJournal of Cancer website (http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc)\nREFERENCES\nAbbey CK, Borowsky AD, McGoldrick ET, Gregg JP, Maglione JE, Cardiff\nRD, Cherry SR (2005) In vivo PET imaging of progression of\ntransformation in a mouse model of mammary neoplasia.
