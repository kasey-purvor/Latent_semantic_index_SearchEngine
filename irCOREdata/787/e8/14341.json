The main force behind these changes has been the dramatic increase in the number\nof students without a commensurate increase in teaching staff. Typically, many Design\ndepartments are now teaching at student-staff ratios of up to 50:1 compared with the 10:1\ntypical of Design courses only a few years ago. With the more recent reductions in higher-\neducation funding, combined with the added pressures on staff to raise their research profile\nand also become income generators, the problems relating to increased student numbers have\nbeen further exacerbated. The authors of this paper believe that in the current educational\nclimate, the only way to maintain and promote the quality of the educational provision is to\nmake teaching and learning more productive and efficient by harnessing modern technology.\nEarlier this year, we developed an online learning resource on a lecture entitled Contemporary\nCrafts, based on a platform provided by a TLTP project, STILE (Students' and Teachers'\nIntegrated Learning Environment), and put it into use for an undergraduate introductory design\nmodule, Contextual Basis of Design. The work was initiated with two objectives:\n1. It was expected that an intensive short-term effort to build the online resource would\nbring about significant long-term benefits by reducing both the costs and staff time\ninvolved in the management, delivery and updating of the course materials.\n2. It was intended that student support would be improved by providing them with flexible\naccess to learning resources which included lecture notes, bibliography, lecturer\ninformation, and a large number of images with explanations. These visual materials\n69\nZhengmai Zhao et al Online learning for design students\nwere regarded to be particularly important for students to better understand the subject\nmatter, but students had previously had only a limited access to them.\nIn order to improve the learning resource itself, and to find the most appropriate way to\nincorporate it into existing pedagogical practice, an exploratory study was carried out. In this\npaper, a description of the online resource will be provided, along with a report on results from\nthe study, and a discussion of some issues raised from the initial experience.\nThe online resource\nThe World Wide Web provides an excellent platform for developing, organizing and\ndisseminating learning resources due to its unique combination of features: universal\nreadership, hypertext and multimedia capabilities (Berners-Lee et al, 1994). Once information\nis made available on the Web, it is accessible from any computer connected to the Internet\nworld-wide, which allows a highly flexible access to the learning resource. Documents on the\nWeb can be organized in hypertext form. This means two things: (1) the provider can build a\nresource in a non-linear fashion, and expand the resource by integrating new material using\nhypertext links; and (2) the reader can escape from the sequential organization of the pages to\npursue a thread of his or her own, something which offers unusually high levels of learner\ncontrol. The multimedia capability of the Web makes it possible to incorporate resources in a\nvariety of forms including text, visuals, sound, and graphics. It is due to these attractive\nfeatures that the educational community has been putting great efforts to make learning\nresources available through the Web (Blumberg, 1994; Rebelsky, 1994). STILE (Ruggles et al,\n1995; Zhao et al, 1995), one of TLTP Phase I projects funded jointly by the four UK higher-\neducation funding bodies (HEFCE, HEFCW, SHEFC, and DENI), is more ambitious in\nmaking educational resources available through the Web. It involves four UK universities,\ninitially bringing together the expertise of the University of Leicester and Loughborough\nUniversity of Technology, and then being extended in its second year to De Montfort\nUniversity and the Open University. STILE aims to establish a powerful Web-based learning\nenvironment with three main features:\n\u2022 the provision of a large, extensible resource-base with special reference to images covering\na broad range of disciplines;\n\u2022 the means to locate and access relevant information efficiently; and\n\u2022 the means to facilitate a more flexible approach to learning, including group work and\ndistance and collaborative learning.\nWe decided to develop an online resource within the STILE framework due to its simple\nmodel, consistent interface and range of tools which makes both the access to and the\nprovision of information relatively easy. Additional important reasons for adopting STILE\nwere that the STILE software is freely available to all UK higher-educational institutions, and\nthat the project provided the necessary technical and financial support.\nThe conceptual model of a STILE resource-base can be thought of as a network of pieces of\ninformation. Each piece of information is either a resource (something to be found and used) or\nindexing information (something to assist in finding the desired resource). The indexing\ninformation is also referred to as topics. A topic represents a particular subject area. Subject\n70\nVolume 4 Number I\nareas can be anything general, specific, material or abstract. In terms of this particular study,\ntopics include Contemporary Crafts, Craftperson, Slides of Contemporary Crafts, and Glass.\nThe resources are actual teaching and learning materials. In this study, images and\nbibliographies are considered as primary resources. Figure 1 illustrates the STILE abstract\nmodel, where the shaded circles represent topics which form a topic net, the boxes represent\nresources which hang on the topic net, and the dashed arrows represent links to external\nrelevant information. The resource-base holds a hierarchical structure, with more general\ntopics being placed at a higher level in the hierarchy.\nFigure I:\nThe STILE abstract\nmodel\nIt is rather natural that the STILE model is realized on the Web because both STELE and the\nWeb consist of networks of linked information. Each STILE topic is represented as an HTML\n(HyperText Markup Language) document, each resource is represented as a file the Web can\nhandle, and links of information are represented using hypertext links. Navigation of the STELE\nresource-base can be performed by following the hypertext links. This method of locating\ninformation is simple, but can be slow since it proceeds only one step at a time through the\nnetwork. More effective navigation of the topic net is possible using the STILE navigation tools.\nOne such tool allows navigation at the topic-title level rather than the actual topic document\nlevel. The major advantage of this functionality is that it makes parallel navigation possible, i.e.,\nmore than one link can be followed at a time, thus speeding up the process of locating\ninformation. Another useful navigation tool is the topic-title search engine. Given a word or\nphrase, the search engine will gather all topics in the current resource-base which include the\ngiven word or phrase in their titles, and display them in the order of relevance.\nThe process of building the STILE resource-base featured in this study began with design of\nthe structure. This work included the identification of the indexing information (topics), the\n71\nZhengmai Zhao et al Online learning for design students\nactual information the students would require (resources), and the structure of the topic\nnetwork. Then topic information, in plain-text format, was marked up using an extremely\nsimple but function-limited markup language called Trivial MetaLanguage, and converted into\nthe topic network using the STILE batch conversion tool. Following that, the STILE browser-\nbased editor was used to link resources (mainly images in GIF format) into the topic net, and to\nmake necessary modifications to the resultant resource-base. The combination of batch\nconversion tool and interactive editor enabled a standard STILE resource-base to be built\nwithout the need to learn how to write HTML documents.\nEvaluation\nObjectives\nThe main purpose of the evaluation was to see how the online resource on the lecture entitled\nContemporary Crafts worked in a real educational situation so as to improve both the system\nitself and the way it is integrated into pedagogical practice. Due to the ill-defined goal of the\nevaluation, an exploratory evaluation strategy was employed. More specifically, an attempt\nwas made to examine the effectiveness of the resource-base in terms of the product of using\nthe resource-base, the process of interacting with the system, and the attitude towards the\ninnovation.\nParticipants\nTwelve out of 168 undergraduate students who were taking the introductory design course\nContextual Basis of Design were requested to participate in the study. They were chosen\nbecause they were assigned the seminar presentation topic concerned with the subject of\nContemporary Crafts (all other students were allotted seminar presentations against lectures\nnot on the Web). It must be noted that the allocation of seminar topics was conducted\nrandomly. Each chosen student used the resource-base, completed questionnaires, and attended\ninterviews.\nProcedure\nShortly before the lecture on Contemporary Crafts, the chosen students were introduced to the\nonline resource as a study reference in addition to the lecture. They were each provided with\nflexible access to the resource through about 20 PCs with high bandwidth connection to the\nInternet in the university library. Since the online material was intended as a flexible learning\nresource, the students were supposed to access it whenever they wanted. Obviously because of\nthis, it was impractical to observe in person how the students exactly interacted-with the system.\nAs an alternative, an attempt to elicit such information was made using a combination of self-\nreporting and an automated user-access log. At the very beginning of the study, a questionnaire\ndeveloped by Draper et al (1994) was used to measure the students' previous experience with\ncomputers. The students were also given another questionnaire that they were required to hand\nin by the end of the evaluation. This questionnaire, adapted from Shneiderman's QUIS tool\n(Shneiderman, 1992), covered a range of issues including use of the system, overall reactions to\nthe system, system capabilities, process of learning to use the system, and efficiency of using\nthe system. Every student who took the course was requested to give a seminar presentation on\nan allotted topic about a month after the related lecture was given. The assessment data of all\n72\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nstudents' presentations was available for the subsequent comparison. After all the chosen\nstudents made their presentations, structured interviews were conducted.\nResults and discussion\nAccording to the students' self-report, they used the online resource twice on average, and the\naverage length of each session was 25 minutes. These figures were consistent with the data\nautomatically captured in the server log file. The students reported that they used the resource\nfor reviewing the lecture, preparing for seminar presentation, and seeking new ideas. They also\nreported that curiosity of this new learning technology served as an important initial driving\nforce for them to start using the system.\nAnalysis of questionnaires and interview protocols showed that the overall reaction to the\nsystem was generally positive. The system was regarded by the students as being useful,\nenjoyable to use, and easy to use once they had mastered the basic skills needed to use the\nsystem. Most of the students found it easy to find the information they wanted, and to navigate\naround the system. However, their responses towards how easy it was to learn to operate the\nsystem were rather diverse. A further investigation of the students' computer experiences\nsuggests a link exists between their skills of using computers and their response to this issue. It\nwould appear that those students who felt more confident with computers found it easier to\nlearn to operate the system.\nThe students listed a range of benefits from the system. First, the system served as a backup to\nthe lecture, which gave the students an opportunity to review the lecture in more detail. More\ninterestingly, some of the students said that having known the lecture was online, they could\nconcentrate better on the interaction with the tutor during the lecture itself without being\nworried about taking detailed notes, and that it had the potential to significantly change the\nway in which they would respond to lectures in the future. Second, the system provided greater\nflexibility of access to the material, with respect to time, place, pace, and sequencing. The\nstudents liked the possibility of accessing the material in their own time and at a place\npreferable to them. They did not have much choice of place, since none of them had access to\nthe Web anywhere except in the university library. However, they saw this as a great potential\nbenefit of the system. They appreciated the control provided by the system in terms of the pace\nand sequencing when browsing through the material, especially in the investigation of the\nvisual material. Access to primary materials, images of crafts for instance, is vital for design\nstudents to obtain artistic feeling, critical thinking, and creative inspiration. In this particular\ncase, the lecturer had a large collection of slides and only one hour to show them. With the\nsystem, the students were now happier to have more flexible access to them. As one of\nstudents commented during the interview: 'It's just good to get down to a little bit and study it\nand then go on to the next when you're ready, rather than have a quick look and just walk out'.\nIn addition, some of the students felt that they became more engaged in the learning process\nwhen interacting with the system than when sitting in lectures. Finally, the students, especially\nthose with little computer experience, felt more confident in learning with technology-based\nsystems after using the system.\nThe overwhelming dissatisfaction expressed by the students was with the slow response rate of\nthe system. The length of time to display an image, with an average size of 50KBytes,\nsometimes became intolerable due largely to the low capacity of the university network\n73\nZhengmai Zhao et al Online learning for design students\nservice. In addition, a richer resource-base was strongly demanded for future use. The system\ndid not include links to any materials by others because the subject-author could not find any\nrelevant external resources. A number of improvements were also suggested by the students\nincluding the provision of more explicit online help, a full-text search engine, a printing-out\nfacility, and a multiple-windows capability so that comparisons between images could be made\nmore easily.\nEvery student's seminar presentation was monitored by using a common mark sheet, and a\ngroup discussion about its positive and negative aspects was carried out immediately after each\npresentation. The presentations by the students chosen to participate in our study seemed better\nthan those of the remaining students. Ninety-one per cent of the chosen students obtained a\ngrade of A or B, while only 82% of the remaining students reached such a grade. In contrast to\n21% of the remaining students receiving an A grade, the percentage of the chosen students\nreceiving a top grade was as high as 36%. However, the results of the Mann-Whitney U test\nshow that there is not a significant difference in the grades of seminar presentations between\nthe chosen students and the remaining students (NA= 11, NB= 144, U = 592, z = 1.39<1.96).\nAs mentioned early in this section, an attempt was made to obtain the information in relation to\nthe students' interaction with the system by using a combination of self-report and automated\nuser-access log. It was found that the students could explain the basic strategy with which they\ndealt with the system, e.g., systematically covering all contents or selectively picking up points\nwhich looked interesting to them. However, they were not able to recall the detail of their\nbehaviour. For example, they had difficulty detailing where they got lost even though they\nreported disorientation in their navigation, which could be very useful information in terms of\nimproving the structure of the material. Moreover, it was not realized until quite late that the\ninformation captured in the Web server access-log file was not adequate to determine the\nstudents' actual navigational tracks because of Web client-side cacheing. Simply speaking, a\nWeb browser, which is the interface to the system, can store in its local cache a certain number\nof Web pages previously requested by its users. Every time a request for a Web page is made\nby a user, the browser checks to see if the page is in its cache. If not, the browser sends a\nrequest over the network and then stores the received page in the cache. Otherwise, it picks up\nthe page from the cache without requesting the server to provide that page. In such a case, the\nserver access-log file will not include this user request. Obviously, the cacheing function is\nable to save time and cut down traffic over the network. However, it posed a problem for this\nstudy in its attempt to find how the material on a server is accessed by a user.\nThe evaluation effort described so far concentrated on only one, but probably the most\nimportant one, of our objectives for using the online resource, that is, to facilitate student\nlearning. The other longer-term objectives were to reduce the cost and staff time spent on the\nmanagement of course materials. The related questions concerned how easy it was for the tutor\nto put original resources into the system and to update them afterwards. Compared to the\nevaluation of student use of the system, the assessment of ease of use for the tutor to deliver\nresources through the STILE platform was more straightforward. Experience from this study\nshowed that the maintenance of the resource-base was relatively easy through the use of the\nSTILE browser-based editor. However, it was still not easy, especially for a non-UNIX user to\nbuild a STILE resource-base even though HTML programming skills were not necessary. As\ndescribed earlier, to build the resource-base, a bulk conversion of our topic network was\ncarried out from a marked-up file using the STILE batch conversion tool. For a non-UNIX\n74\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 1\nuser, extra skills such as file transfer over the network and a basic working knowledge of\nUNIX are needed to fulfil this task. This is because the current STELE conversion tool works\nonly under the UNIX environment. Once the topic network was established, the resources\n(mainly images of crafts) were mounted onto the topic-net using the STELE browser-based\neditor. This task was easy but tedious because there were a quite large number of images which\nhad to be linked into the topic-net one by one. There are two suggestions to ease this difficulty.\nFirst, to improve STELE's authoring facility to allow platform-independent mass conversion\nenabling the system to convert not only pure topic networks but also to include references to\nresources from bulk data. Second, for potential STELE resource providers who are computer\nilliterate, to improve their computing skills simply because it is unrealistic to expect to gain\nbenefit from a new technology without a basic technical understanding.\nConclusions and further work\nThe online resource-base has proved to be successful in demonstrating its great potential in\nmeeting our proposed objectives, that is, improvement of the support for Design teaching and\nlearning. The students revealed in the study a great appreciation of the high degree of learner\ncontrol provided by the system, and expressed a strong demand for more information online\nconcerning the subject area. From the tutor's perspective, the maintenance of the existing\nresource-base has been made relatively easy by the use of the STELE browser-based editor\nalthough the current conversion tool still needs real improvement. Nevertheless, this\nexperience has also raised a range of issues that need to be thoroughly addressed before the\ninnovation can be fully applied to existing teaching and learning activities. Some of these are\nhighlighted below, and might be of general interest to those in a similar situation.\nThe university's IT infrastructure particularly for online access to learning resources needs to\nbe urgently improved, which includes updating the network capacity and the establishment of\nspecialized computer labs for online resource delivery. This has an implication for the way in\nwhich the university allocates its resources. A shift from teaching to learning, and a consequent\nshift in resources from teaching resources to learning resources, might be essential.\nNew strategies and skills need to be developed for both students and tutors. For students,\nconsulting information from an online system is different from consulting information from\nconventional printed materials. Likewise, for tutors, delivering information in hypertext form\nrequires different abilities from those they have already developed.\nTeaching styles need to change in order to make effective use of such innovations. In this case,\nit might be possible to rely heavily on the online system for information delivery so that more\nstaff time can be devoted to actual student contact in helping students develop the practical\nskills of designing and making things.\nGuidance on the use of copyright materials should be made available to the academic staff who\nwant to provide educational resources online. Unless the materials are owned by the provider,\ncopyright clearance is necessary for their use or even their adaptation. The lack of knowledge\nof dealing with copyright appears to be a restraining force in making educational resources\navailable online.\nFurther work on the use of the online learning resource will concentrate on three areas. The\nfirst area of work will be to include more information in the resource-base. The contents of the\n75\nZhengmai Zhao et al Online learning for design students\nresource-base will gradually expand to include the whole module of Contextual Basis of\nDesign; links to relevant external resources will be added; materials such as previous students'\nseminar presentations and transcriptions of group discussions may be integrated; and the use of\ndigital video, animation, and 3D objects will also be explored. The second area will involve\nencouraging students to become not only information consumers but also information\nproviders, and to make use of communication facilities supplied by the STILE platform.\nFinally, the possibility of replacing facts-based lectures with a well-built online resource\nsystem will be further investigated.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to express their gratitude to all members of STILE project team and those\nstudents who participated in the study described here.\nReferences\nBerners-Lee, T., Cailliau, R., Luotonen, A.
