INTRODUCTION\nA few years ago Konopelchenko, together with his collaborators,1,2 introduced the subject of\nWeierstrass representations of surfaces immersed in multidimensional spaces. This has generated\nquite a lot of interest3,4 and has led to the connection with the CPN21 harmonic maps. Exploiting\nthis connection, we have recently proposed a generalization of these ideas to the CP2 ~Ref. 5! case\nand, more recently, managed to generalize it further\u2014to the CPN21 case.6\nThese generalizations lead to the study of immersed surfaces, whose metric is then related to\nthe properties of the corresponding harmonic maps. In the CP1 case all harmonic maps ~from S2)\nare holomorphic ~or antiholomorphic! and, as the induced metric is characterized by the holomor-\nphic component of the energy, this characterization is complete. This is also the case for the\nholomorphic CPN21 maps.\nIn the CPN21 case ~for N.2) there are harmonic maps which are not holomorphic7 and for\nthem the above mentioned construction6 is not complete, as in the general case we would expect\nthe maps to be characterized by the total energy. Hence a further generalization is called for and\nsuch a generalization is provided in this article.\nIn the next section we briefly review the CPN21 harmonic maps ~using the formalism as given\nin Ref. 7! and in the following sections relate these maps to the various versions of the Weierstrass\nproblem.\nII. CPN\u00c01 HARMONIC MAPS\nA. Formulation\nThe CPN21 models are, in fact, a generalization of the, perhaps the simplest, sigma model,\nnamely, the S2 model\u2014also called the vector O(3) model. The CPN21 models involve maps from\nR2, or S2 if a nontrivial topology is required, to CPN21, i.e.,\na!Electronic mail: grundlan@crm.umontreal.ca\nb!Electronic mail: w.j.zakrzewski@durham.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS VOLUME 44, NUMBER 8 AUGUST 2003\n33700022-2488\/2003\/44(8)\/3370\/13\/$20.00 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

Is this problem related to the harmonic maps of the previous\nsections, presumably corresponding to the case of CP1?\nThis is indeed the case as has been discussed in Ref. 4. To see this we put\nw 5\nc\nf\u00af\n~41!\nand note that\nc 5w\n~]\u00afw\u00af !1\/2\n11uwu2 , f 5\n~]w !1\/2\n11uwu2 ~42!\nsatisfy ~40!. In fact, one can show that ~19! and ~40! are equivalent.\nMoreover, we can introduce three real quantities:\nX15iE\ng\n@c\u00af 21f2#dz2@c21f\u00af 2#dz\u00af ,\nX25E\ng\n@c\u00af 22f2#dz 1 @c22f\u00af 2#dz\u00af , ~43!\nX3522E\ng\nc\u00af fdz 1 cf\u00af dz\u00af ,\nwhere g is any curve from a fixed point to z. Then, it is easy to show that if c and f satisfy ~40!,\nthe functions Xi do not depend on the contour of the curve g but only on its endpoints.\nFurthermore, if we treat Xi as components of a vector rW5(X1 ,X2 ,X3) and introduce the\nmetric\ngzz 5 ~]rW ,]rW !, gz\u00afz\u00af 5 ~]\u00afrW ,]\u00afrW !, gzz\u00af 5 ~]rW , ]\u00afrW !, ~44!\n3375J.

Note that ~45! is a term in the general expression for the energy density of the CP1\nmap. However, as all harmonic maps on S2 satisfy w5w(z),7 we note that gzz\u00af is the total energy\ndensity of this map. ~We are assuming here that we are not dealing with antiholomorphic maps, as\nin this case we simply interchange the roles of z and z\u00af .)\nIV. A GENERALIZED WEIERSTRASS REPRESENTATION IN RM\nHaving observed that the Weierstrass problem is related to the equations of the CP1 model,\nwe have in Refs. 5 and 6 presented a CPN21 generalization of the Weierstrass problem. Our\ngeneralization was based on the observation that for a generalized Weierstrass system in multi-\ndimensional spaces we need a set of w i and c i which generalize the w and c of the CP1 case.\nThen we noted that the quantities w i\n2\n, i52, . . . ,N , defined in ~33!, provide such a choice as\n~37! is a natural CPN21 generalization of ~42!.\nWhat should we take for the functions c i? In Ref. 6 we argued that ~41! suggested that we put\nc i 5 f i w\u00af i ~46!\nwith no summation over the indices i52, . . . ,N . Then, to complete the generalization of the\nWeierstrass system in multi-dimensional spaces, we need relations which would be analogs of\n~40!, i.e., we need to prescribe the first derivatives ]\u00afw i and ]c i in terms of w i and c i .\nNote that from ~46! we have\n]c i 5 ]~ f i w\u00af i! 5 ] f i w\u00af i 1 f i ~]\u00afw i!. ~47!\nSo, we are left to specify ]\u00afw i in terms of w i , f i and their derivatives. To do this, in Ref. 1, we\nnoted that from ~36! we had\n]\u00afw i\n2 5 2\nf i~ f\u00afl ] f l!\nA3 ~ f\u00afk ]\u00af f k 1 f k ]\u00af f\u00afk!\n1\n1\nA2 @~11u f u\n2!]]\u00af f i2~ f\u00afk]\u00af f k!] f i2~ f k]\u00af f\u00afk!] f i2]\u00af f i~ f\u00afk] f k!2 f i~]\u00af f\u00afk] f k!2 f i~ f\u00afk ]]\u00af f k!# .\n~48!\nHowever, Eq. ~10! allowed us to eliminate the second derivatives ]]\u00af f i from ~48! and also we\nnoted that all the terms involving first derivatives ]\u00af f and ] f\u00af in ~48! canceled.

Moreover, it is easy to check that the system of\nequations ~53! reduces to Eq. ~19! when N52.\nV. A MODIFIED GENERALIZED WEIERSTRASS REPRESENTATION\nThe generalized Weierstrass representation given in the previous section leads to pairs of\nfunctions w i , c i , i52, . . . ,N , and, as discussed in Ref. 6, to a geometric interpretation in terms\nof surfaces in RM for which their metric is given by uDzu2 @as in the CP1 case\u2014see ~45!#. This is\nthe case for the holomorphic solutions but we know7 that CPN21 models have harmonic maps\nwhich are not holomorphic ~even CP1 has such maps; in this case, antiholomorphic maps, but\nthese can be considered to be complex conjugates of holomorphic ones!. But for CPN21, N.2,\nwe have also maps which are neither holomorphic nor antiholomorphic. So can we generalize the\nWeierstrass problem differently to bring out this property?\nIn fact, our discussion of the CPN21 models does tell us what to do. We should use both w i\nand F i . Thus we should consider a larger problem and use F i , w i, and f i .\nThen taking ~36! and repeating the steps as in ~48! ~and using w2 and F2) we get\n]\u00afw i\n2 5 2Aw i\n2~w\u20202\u0095 f ! 2 f i@~w\u20202\u0095w2! 1 ~ f \u2020\u0095w2!~w2\u2020\u0095 f !# , ~54!\n]\u00afF i\n2 5 2AF i\n2~ f \u2020\u0095F\u00af 2! 2 f\u00afi@~F\u20202\u0095F2! 1 ~ f \u2020\u0095F\u00af 2!~F\u00af \u20202\u0095 f !# . ~55!\nThese equations should then be supplemented with the expressions for ] f and ] f\u00af .

The equations fall into two sets ~those involving ] f i and w j and those involving ] f\u00afi and\nF j). Both sets are equivalent to the same equations for f i , namely, ~10!.\n~ii! Instead of taking f i we could introduce, in analogy with ~46!, new functions c i and C i by,\nsay, c i5 f iw\u00af i and C i5 f iF\u00af i . Then our set of functions would effectively decouple.\n~iii! One can consider what happens when f i are holomorphic; i.e., ]\u00af f i50. Then, as is easy to\ncheck, f \u2020\u0095F\u00af 250, which in turn shows that uF2u250, thus demonstrating that F i250, and\nwe are left with ~54! and ~56! for f i , w j , i.e., with the previous system ~53!.\nVI. GEOMETRICAL ASPECTS\nNext we consider some geometrical aspects of our procedure. This requires the introduction of\na real vector XiPRM which is a generalization of the vector ~43! constructed for CP1. In Ref. 6\nwe have introduced such a vector and showed that its properties generalize those of ~43!.\nHowever, our approach here generalizes the discussion in Ref. 6 and elucidates some of the\npoints made there. Namely, in our new construction we exploit the matrices M and L . We\nintroduce two matrices\nV 5 E\ng\nM dz\u00af 1 E\ng\nM \u2020 dz ~57!\nand\nW 5 E\ng\nL dz\u00af 1 E\ng\nL\u2020 dz , ~58!\nand for the components of our vectors we take individual entries of each matrix. As Tr M5Tr L\n50 we see that V and W have, each, only N221 independent entries so our construction gives us\ntwo vectors in RN\n221\n.\nNotice also that W and V do not depend on the contour of integration g. This follows from the\nfact that for an integral\nZ 5 E\nG\nF~z ,z\u00af ! dz 1 F\u00af ~z ,z\u00af ! dz\u00af\nto be independent of the integration contour G the condition is that F and F\u00af must satisfy\n]\u00afF 5 ]F\u00af ,\nwhich is the case for V and W due to, respectively, our conservation laws ~27! and ~28!.\nOf course we can reexpress our vectors V and W in terms of the Weierstrass functions w i , F j\nand f k or in terms of w i , c j , Fk, and C l .\nNote that in the CP1 case the matrix W is given by\n3378 J.

In the CP1 case, as shown in Ref. 5, we\ncan restrict ourselves to a vector with only three components. So we add both contributions and\nconsider an N221 component vector given by all the entries ~except the top left hand corner one!\nof the matrix\nX 5 E\ng\n~M1L ! dz\u00af 1 E\ng\n~M \u20201L\u2020! dz . ~61!\nNext we calculate the components of the induced metric\ngab 5 (\nlk\n]Xkl\n]a\n]Xlk\n]b\n, ~62!\nwhere a and b are z or z\u00af .

However, they do, in fact, vanish on the\nsolutions of the CPN21 model, i.e., on the vectors f which satisfy ~10!, at least those that are\ndefined on S2. To see this we note that\ngz\u00afz\u00af 5\n2u f u2~]\u00af f \u2020\u0095]\u00af f ! 1 ~]\u00af f \u2020\u0095 f !~ f \u2020\u0095]\u00af f !\nu f u2 ~71!\nand gzz is its complex conjugate.\nHowever, all solutions of ~10! defined on S2 are7 of the type\nf 5 P1k g , ~72!\nwhere g is a holomorphic vector, i.e., g\u00deg(z\u00af ), and k is some integer taken from the set\n$0,1, . . . ,N21%, and P1\nl g is defined by the successive, i.e., P1\nl g5P1(P1l21g), repetition of the\noperation\nP1h 5 ]h 2 h\n~h\u2020\u0095]h !\nuhu2 . ~73!\nThen, as is known,7 P1\nk g satisfy\n~P1\nl g !\u2020\u0095P1k g 5 0 if k\u00del , ~74!\n]P1\nk g 5 P1\nk11g 1 P1\nk g\n~P1\nk g\u2020\u0095]P1k g !\nuP1\nk gu2\n, ~75!\n]\u00afP1\nk g 5 2P1\nk21g\nuP1\nk gu2\nuP1\nk21gu2\n. ~76!\nThus (]\u00af f \u2020\u0095]\u00af f )50 and ( f \u2020\u0095]\u00af f )50 and so we see that gzz50 ~and so also gz\u00afz\u00af50).\nVII.

However,\nit is clear that this possibility to gather both terms into one expression does not generalize to\nhigher CPN21 models.\nVIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe main aim of this article has been to derive a generalization of the Weierstrass system to\nthe CPN21 case for which the metric of the induced surfaces is determined by the energy density\nof the corresponding harmonic map.\nThis has led us to introduce a set of 3N complex functions w i , F j and f k which are required\nto satisfy a system of four classes of first order equations and which are equivalent to the full\nsystem of equations of the CPN21 model.\nWe have also introduced a set of (N221) real quantities Xi , which can be treated as coordi-\nnates of a surface immersed in RN221 and we have shown that the induced metric of our map is\ngiven by\nds25~ uDzu21uD\u00af zu2! dz dz\u00af . ~86!\n3381J.
