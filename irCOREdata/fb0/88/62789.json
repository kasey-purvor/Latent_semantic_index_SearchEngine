The\nCaledonian-Appalachian Orogen (C-AO) is marked by\na ,50 m.y. period of granite intrusions with associated\nmolybdenite mineralisation systems. This study com-\nbines Re\u2013Os molybdenite and U\u2013Pb zircon geochronol-\nogy with fluid inclusion studies to investigate the timing\nand nature of molybdenite mineralisation associated\nwith the Shap, Skiddaw and Weardale granites from the\nnorthern England sector of the Acadian phase of the C\u2013\nAO (Fig. 1). These three granites represent three of six\ngranite intrusions considered to be components of the\nLake District batholith (Ennerdale, Eskdale, Threlkeld;\nFig. 1). These intrusions reflect, in part, the evolution of\nthe northern part of eastern Avalonia34\u201345 (and refer-\nences therein) and the geochronology to be presented\nhere can yield important information on the timing of\ntectonism during the Acadian phase of the C\u2013AO in the\nnorthern England region. The results are further\ndiscussed in the context of granite-related molybdenite\nsystems present in the western Ireland (Connemara)\nsector and in regard to the timing and duration of\nmagmatism and also the tectonic setting of the C\u2013AO.\nShap, Skiddaw and Weardale intrusions\nand associated mineralisation\nThe Shap granite\nIntruded into Ordovician volcanics and Silurian sedi-\nments (Fig. 1), the Shap granite is a composite intrusion,\nrepresenting three stages of magmatism.

All stages\ncontain mafic enclaves. Sulphide mineralisation (pyrite\u2013\nchalcopyrite\u2013bornite\u00a1molybdenite) in the Shap granite\nis both disseminated and quartz vein-hosted. Quartz\nveins are 1\u20132 cm thick, dip steeply to the east and post-\ndate all stages of the Shap granite. The ore mineral\nassemblage consists of chalcopyrite\u2013pyrite\u2013bornite\u00a1-\nmolybdenite. Molybdenite in some cases is the pre-\ndominant ore mineral occurring with minor\nchalcopyrite, pyrite and bornite as both disseminations\nand in veins. No evidence was observed to determine the\nsulphide paragenesis. Quartz veins are bereft of an\nalteration selvage; however, matrix biotite and plagio-\nclase are partially altered to chlorite and sericite\nrespectively.\nSeveral studies have presented determinations for the\nemplacement age of the Shap granite (Fig. 2).\nUncertainties for all ages noted below are at the 2s\nlevel. Whole-rock (stages one and two), feldspar and\nbiotite Rb\u2013Sr data yield an isochron age of 394\u00a13 Ma\n(n522).71 In contrast, Rundle52 reported a Rb\u2013Sr age\nusing whole-rock data (stages two and three intrusion)\nof 381\u00a18 Ma. A recent single crystal Rb\u2013Sr feldspar\nstudy yields an age of 405\u00a12 Ma.13 K\u2013Ar biotite\nanalyses from the stage two granite yields a mean age\nof 397\u00a17 Ma; however, individual analyses range from\n394\u00a112 to 403\u00a112 Ma (n53).71 A discordia of U\u2013Pb\ndata for three multi-grain zircon fractions yield an upper\nintersection age of 390\u00a16 Ma.51 Based on the agree-\nment of this age with a mean of 21 Rb\u2013Sr and K\u2013Ar\nages,8 the U\u2013Pb age was suggested to reflect the age of\nemplacement for the Shap granite. Molybdenite from\nthe Shap granite was used in one the first Re\u2013Os\nmolybdenite studies, which determined an age of\n430\u00a120 Ma, using a decay constant of 1?611610211\na21.31 Using the currently accepted decay constant\n(1?666610211 a21),57,58 an age of 415?2\u00a119 Ma is\ncalculated. Though all the age determinations overlap\nwithin uncertainty, there is a significant degree of\ndisparity between the nominal ages (Fig. 2).\nThe Skiddaw granite\nThe granite is genetically and spatially related to the W\nmineralisation of the Carrock Fell deposit. Intruded into\nthe early Ordovician metasediments of the Skiddaw\ngroup, the Skiddaw granite outcrops are restricted\nto three localities (Sinen Gill, Caldew Valley and\nGrainsgill).59 The latter represents the slightly smaller,\nthough heavily mineralised and hydrothermally altered\noutcrop (Fig. 1). Unaltered, the Skiddaw granite is\nmedium-grained and comprises plagioclase, orthoclase,\nbiotite and quartz. Mineralisation is confined to the\nnorthern margin of the granite in Grainsgill and occurs\nin a series of steeply dipping N\u2013S quartz veins typically\n(0?5 m in thickness (Harding, Smith and Emerson\nveins, Fig. 1).3,59,60 Barren early quartz veins are cross-\ncut by the main ore-bearing N\u2013S trending quartz veins\nthat carry wolframite\u00a1scheelite.59 Alteration associated\nwith this mineralisation is minimal, with the exception\nof a greisen assemblage in the granite which also\ncontains arsenopyritezpyritezapatite. Post-dating the\nlatter is sulphide mineralisation (arsenopyrite, pyrite,\nchalcopyrite, molybdenite, sphalerite, bismuth) that\noccurs in quartz stringers in fractures of the veins and\ngreisen zones.3 Calcite\u00a1siderite\u00a1fluorite veining post-\ndates sulphide mineralisation.

Magmatic biotite from\nSinen Gill yield a mean K\u2013Ar biotite age of 399\u00a16 Ma.9\nOverlapping within uncertainty are slightly younger K\u2013\nAr ages (392\u00a14 Ma) for magmatic biotite from Sinen\nGill and Caldew Valley, which are interpreted to record\nthe final cooling of the Skiddaw granite.59 In accord\nwith these ages is an Rb\u2013Sr isochron age (398\u00a18 Ma)\ndetermined from K-Feldspar from altered granite;\nhowever, Rb\u2013Sr whole-rock data yield a younger age\nof 383\u00a14 Ma.52 Younger ages are also reported for\nhydrothermal muscovite from greisen at Grainsgill and\nof the Harding vein (mean age of 387\u00a14 Ma),52 which\noverlaps, within uncertainty, with a Rb\u2013Sr fluid inclu-\nsion age (392\u00a15 Ma) obtained from both early and late\nphases of quartz veining.62\nThe Weardale granite\nThis granite is a concealed body beneath the\nCarboniferous rocks. It is intersected at 390?5 m below\nthe surface in the Rookhope borehole. The boundary\nbetween the Weardale granite and Carboniferous sedi-\nments is marked by a soil-like quartz\u2013mica-rich mud-\nstone, which is suggested to represent the weathered\nsurface of the granite20 (and references therein). The\nCarboniferous sediments are not metamorphosed, sug-\ngesting that the granite pre-dates the Carboniferous\nrocks. The granite is medium-grained and consists of\nmuscovite, biotite, plagioclase, orthoclase and accessory\nmagnetite\u2013ilmenite, zircon and monazite. Quartz and\nmica define a flat lying fabric, which is suggested to\nrepresent the apex of a cupola.20 The granite contains\nveins of quartz pegmatite and aplite, a number of which\nare tourmaline-bearing.20 At 447 m, a 3 cm wide\nmolybdenite bearing quartz pegmatite vein cuts the\ngranite fabric. Molybdenite mineralisation is accompa-\nnied by chalcopyrite, minor bornite and pyrite (Fig. 1).\nNo tourmaline is observed in the quartz and the\nrelationship between tourmaline and molybdenite\nmineralisation is not known. An alteration selvage is\nabsent; however, plagioclase and biotite show minor\nalteration to sericite and chlorite respectively.\nEarly age determinations have been presented from\nRb\u2013Sr and K\u2013Ar muscovite analyses, which range from\n356\u00a112 to 392\u00a16 Ma.16,26 A more recent Rb\u2013Sr whole-\nrock analyses from 564 to 776 m was used to suggest\nthat the emplacement age of the Weardale granite was\n410\u00a110 Ma, intrusion of post-pegmatite vein aplites at\n390\u00a18 Ma, and that hydrothermal activity continued to\n365\u00a18 Ma.32\nSamples and analytical protocols\nSamples\nThree molybdenite-bearing quartz veins were sampled\nfrom the Shap (DS1-06), Skiddaw (DS4-06) and\nWeardale (SSK0576) granites (Fig. 1). Suitably sized\nportions of each sample were used for Re\u2013Os geochro-\nnology and fluid inclusion studies. An additional sample\n(DS6-06) of disseminated molybdenite from the Shap\ngranite was also used to determine a Re\u2013Os age.

B) 2008 VOL 117 NO 1\nShap granite, molybdenite mineralisation occurs dis-\nseminated (DS6-06) and within about 1\u20132 cm quartz\nveins (DS1-06). Molybdenite is present as ,1 cm\ndiameter rosettes, with individual grains of a 2\u20135 mm\n(Fig. 4), and is associated with minor chalcopyrite.\nIn the Skiddaw granite, the molybdenite sample (DS4-\n06) from the Carrock deposit was taken from the surface\nspoil near the adit to the Emerson vein (Fig. 4). The\nspoil consists largely of quartz vein and gresiened\nSkiddaw granite (Fig. 4) and is taken to represent the\nmineralisation of the Emerson vein. It is a 3 mm quartz\nmolybdenite-bearing stringer that cross-cuts a greisen\naltered rock and is considered to represent sulphide\nmineralisation that post-dates the primary W-bearing\nmineralisation.3 Molybdenite is fine-grained (,1 mm)\nand occurs as single grains throughout the stringer with\nminor chalcopyrite and pyrite. Minor muscovite altera-\ntion is also associated with the quartz stringer, which\noccurs as 1\u20132 mm rosettes within and on the selvages of\nthe stringer. Because the molybdenite post-dates the\nmain W-bearing mineralisation, two ,8 kg samples of\nthe Skiddaw granite were taken from separate localities\nat Sinen Gill (SK-1) and Caldew Valley (SK-2) for U\u2013Pb\nzircon geochronology (Fig. 1).\nIn the Weardale granite, molybdenite has only been\nobserved at 447 m in a quartz pegmatite vein in the\nRookhope core (SSK0576, Fig. 4). Molybdenite is the\npredominant ore mineral in this pegmatite vein occur-\nring as ,1 cm rosettes with 2\u20135 mm grains, and isolated\ngrains (Fig. 4).\nAnalytical protocols\nThe Re\u2013Os geochronometry was performed in the\nNorthern Centre for Isotopic and Element Tracing\n(NCEIT) at Durham University. Using conventional\nmineral separation protocols (porcelain disc milling,\nFRANTZ magnetic separation, heavy liquid, water\nfloatation) molybdenite (z44\u2013210 mm fraction) was\nisolated from whole-rock and quartz vein samples.53\nIsotope dilution, using a mixed tracer solution\ncontaining isotopically enriched 185Re and isotopically\nnormal Os, in the form of a gravimetric and isotopic Os\nstandard, was used to determine the isotopic abundance\nof 187Re and 187Os in analysed molybdenite.

The annealed, cleaned bulk\nzircon fraction was then chemically abraded in 200 mL\n29 N HF and 20 mL 8 N HNO3 at 180uC for 12 h\nfollowing a modified chemical abrasion technique to\nremove portions of grains which have suffered Pb-loss.42\nChemically abraded zircons were washed several times\nin ultra-pure water, in warm 3 N HCl for several hours\non a hot-plate, rinsed again in ultra-pure water and 8 N\nHNO3 and split into single grain fractions ready for\ndissolution. A mixed 205Pb\u2013235U tracer was used to spike\nall fractions. Representative fractions were checked in\ncleaned PMP beakers under fibre optic light to check for\ncomplete dissolution. Dissolved, spike-equilibrated sam-\nples were not subjected to ion-exchange procedures but\nwere converted to chloride and loaded onto degassed\nrhenium filaments in silica gel following a procedure\nmodified after.46 Isotope data were collected using a\nThermo Electron Triton equipped with a new generation\nof MassCom secondary electron multiplier.48 A mini-\nmum of 100 ratios were collected for Pb and 60 for U.\nPb ratios were scrutinised for any evidence of organic\ninterferences which were determined to be negligible.\nUncertainties were calculated using numerical error\npropagation.38 Isotope ratios were plotted using\nIsoplot version 3,39 and error ellipses and ages presented\nreflect 2s uncertainty. Total procedural blanks were\nbetween 0?2 and 0?6 pg for Pb and 0?1 pg for U.\nSamples were blank corrected for Pb, and any residual\ncommon Pb was corrected using a Stacey-Kramers\ncommon lead composition.67\nFluid inclusion petrography and microthermometric\nanalyses of the samples were conducted at the Geofluids\nResearch Laboratory, NUI, Galway. Heating and\nfreezing runs on doubly polished fluid inclusion wafers\n(,100 mm thick) were performed using a calibrated\nLinkam THMS600. Calibration with precision of\n\u00a10?2uC at \u201356?6uC and \u00a11uC at 300uC was conducted\nusing synthetic H2O and CO2 standards. Following\nprocedures outlined by Shepherd et al.,61 the tempera-\nture of first ice melting TFM, the temperature of last ice\nmelting TLM and the temperature of homogenisation TH\nwere measured in two-phase liquidzvapour inclusions\nhosted in quartz in all wafers. Fluid salinities were\ncalculated using TLM and the equations of Ref. 6. In\naddition, clathrate melting temperatures recorded in\nsome of these two-phase inclusions were used with the\nequations of Ref. 18 to calculate their fluid salinities.\nLaser Raman microspectroscopy (LRM) was used to\ndetermine the non-aqueous chemical species present in\nfluid inclusions. Analyses were conducted at CREGU\nTable 1 Re\u2013Os isotope data for molybdenite from Shap, Weardale and Skiddaw granites\nSample Weight, mg 187Re*, ppm SD 187Os*, ppb SD Age{ SD\nHLP-5\n1 11 174.3 \u00a10.8 637.6 2.8 219.2 0.9\n2 11 174.6 \u00a10.8 641.4 2.9 220.0 0.9\n3 10 173.5 \u00a10.9 638.6 2.9 220.6 0.9\nWeardale\nSSK0576 45 59.30 \u00a10.19 394.8 1.0 398.3 1.6\nSkiddaw\nDS4-06 70 0.47 \u00a10.003 3.1 0.02 392.3 2.8\nShap\nDS1-06 31 9.51 \u00a10.03 64.5 0.2 405.5 1.7\nDS6-06 21 9.61 \u00a10.06 65.1 0.2 405.2 1.8\nShap{ 9000 11.20 \u00a10.40 77.8 2.3 429.31 19.9\n415.2\" 19.3\nAll uncertainties are quoted at the 2s level.\nHLP-5 is an in-house control molybdenite powder (see text for discussion).\n*Re and Os concentrations and Re\u2013Os age recalculated using uncertainties in Re and Os mass spectrometer measurements,\nstandard and spike Re and Os isotopic compositions, and calibration uncertainties of 185Re and 187Os.\n{Age calculated using the decay constant l187Re51?666610211\/year, without uncertainty.58\n{Re\u2013Os isotope data taken from Ref. 10.\n1Age established using 187Rel51?612610211\/year.31,57,58\n\"Age established using 187Rel51?666610211\/year.31,57,58\nSelby et al.

A\nholographic grating with 1800 grooves per millimetre\nwas used. An exciting radiation at 514?4 nm was\nprovided using an ionized Ar\u2013Ar laser. The laser was\nfocused on inclusions using an Olympus microscope\nwith an 680 objective. The mole fraction of gaseous\nspecies was calculated using the procedure described by\nRef. 19. Bulk fluid inclusion parameters and molar\nvolumes were calculated using the LRM results in\ncombination with the microthermometric data for each\ninclusion (analysed by LRM), and the computer\nprograms CLATHRATES1 and FLUIDS.2\nResults\nRe\u2013Os molybdenite geochronology\nMolybdenite from the Shap, Skiddaw and Weardale\ngranites show considerable differences in 187Re and\n187Os abundances (Table 1). The Weardale sample\n(SSK0576) has the highest 187Re (59 ppm) and 187Os\n(395 ppb) abundances, with Shap molybdenite (DS1-06,\nDS6-06) possessing significantly lower values of,9 ppm\n187Re and 65 ppb 187Os, and the molybdenite from the\nCarrock Fell deposit (Skiddaw, DS4-06) containing very\nlow 187Re (500 ppb) and 187Os (3?1 ppb) contents.\nThe 187Re and 187Os systematics for all samples are\nused to calculate model ages with the decay constant of\nRef. 58. Two molybdenite samples from Shap yield\nmodel Re\u2013Os ages of 405?5\u00a11?7 and 405?2\u00a11?8 Ma\n(Table 1). The Weardale and Skiddaw molybdenite\nsamples yield Re\u2013Os ages of 398?3\u00a11?6 and\n392?3\u00a12?8 Ma respectively (Table 1). All the Re\u2013Os\nages are outside the limits of uncertainty and therefore\nrecord distinct events in relation to the processes\nassociated with the Shap, Weardale and Skiddaw\ngranites.\nSkiddaw granite U\u2013Pb zircon geochronology\nA total of eight single grain fractions, four from Sinen\nGill and three from Caldew Valley, were utilised for\nU\u2013Pb geochronology. These grains all possess high\nU abundances (549\u20134384 ppm; Table 2); seven grains\noverlap within error to give a concordia age\nof 398?8\u00a10?4 Ma (concordance and equivalence:\nMSWD51?5, probability50?11; Fig. 5), with a single\ngrain from the Caldew Valley (SK-2) sample slightly\ndiscordant due to Pb-loss (not shown). This is taken as\nthe emplacement age of the granite. Previous attempts at\ndating the Skiddaw granite from these same localities\nwere problematic in that multi-grain fractions of zircon\nshowed signs of inheritance (J. Evans, personal com-\nmunication, 2007; unpublished BGS data). In the case of\nthis study, single acicular grains were selected and so\ninheritance was avoided. Furthermore, previous\nattempts at dating the Skiddaw granite using the U\u2013Pb\nzircon technique utilised the air-abrasion35 technique to\nminimise the effects of Pb-loss. This would have\ninherently meant that delicate acicular zircons such as\nthose used in this study would not have been previously\nused as they would have been destroyed by the air\nabrasion process. It is also noteworthy that chemical\nabrasion has the effect of dissolving magmatic inclusions\nand so reducing the common lead content.42 T\na\nb\nle\n2\nU\n\u2013\nP\nb\nzi\nrc\no\nn\nID\n-T\nIM\nS\nd\na\nta\nfo\nr\nth\ne\nS\nk\nid\nd\na\nw\ng\nra\nn\nit\ne\nS\na\nm\np\nle\nF\nra\nc\nti\no\nn\nW\ne\nig\nh\nt,\nmg\nU\n,\np\np\nm\nC\nm\n\u2013P\nb\n{ ,\np\np\nm\nR\na\nti\no\ns\nA\ng\ne\n,\nM\na\n2\n0\n6\nP\nb\n\/2\n0\n4\nP\nb\n{\n2\n0\n7\nP\nb\n\/2\n0\n6\nP\nb\n*\n2\ns\n,\n%\n2\n0\n6\nP\nb\n\/2\n3\n8\nU\n*\n2\ns\n,\n%\n2\n0\n7\nP\nb\n\/2\n3\n5\nU\n*\n2\ns\n,\n%\nR\nh\no\n2\n0\n7\nP\nb\n\/2\n0\n6\nP\nb\n2\ns\n,\na\nb\ns\n2\n0\n6\nP\nb\n\/2\n3\n8\nU\n2\n0\n7\nP\nb\n\/2\n3\n5\nU\nS\nK\n-1\nZ\n1\n2\n. 6\n5\n4\n9\n0\n. 9\n5\n9\n9\n1\n0\n. 0\n5\n4\n6\n8\n0\n. 0\n9\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n8\n0\n0\n. 1\n6\n0\n. 4\n8\n1\n7\n8\n0\n. 1\n8\n0\n. 9\n3\n3\n9\n9\n. 3\n2\n. 1\n3\n9\n9\n. 7\n3\n9\n9\n. 6\nZ\n2\n1\n. 2\n4\n3\n8\n4\n0\n. 7\n3\n0\n3\n8\n8\n0\n. 0\n5\n4\n7\n7\n0\n. 0\n7\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n8\n0\n0\n. 1\n7\n0\n. 4\n8\n1\n8\n3\n0\n. 1\n8\n0\n. 9\n4\n4\n0\n2\n. 9\n1\n. 5\n3\n9\n8\n. 7\n3\n9\n9\n. 3\nZ\n3\n1\n. 3\n1\n5\n3\n4\n0\n. 6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n8\n0\n. 0\n5\n4\n7\n5\n0\n. 0\n9\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n8\n0\n0\n. 1\n7\n0\n. 4\n8\n1\n6\n1\n0\n. 1\n9\n0\n. 8\n9\n4\n0\n2\n. 0\n2\n. 0\n3\n9\n8\n. 7\n3\n9\n9\n. 2\nZ\n4\n1\n. 0\n3\n1\n3\n7\n0\n. 5\n2\n4\n4\n4\n6\n0\n. 0\n5\n4\n7\n5\n0\n. 0\n9\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n8\n1\n0\n. 1\n7\n0\n. 4\n8\n1\n7\n0\n0\n. 1\n9\n0\n. 8\n9\n4\n0\n2\n. 2\n1\n. 9\n3\n9\n8\n. 7\n3\n9\n9\n. 2\nZ\n5\n1\n. 3\n3\n2\n1\n5\n0\n. 2\n6\n9\n3\n1\n1\n0\n. 0\n5\n4\n7\n1\n0\n. 0\n6\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n7\n7\n0\n. 1\n7\n0\n. 4\n8\n1\n0\n8\n0\n. 1\n8\n0\n. 9\n3\n4\n0\n0\n. 6\n1\n. 4\n3\n9\n8\n. 5\n3\n9\n8\n. 8\nS\nK\n-2\nZ\n1\n1\n. 0\n2\n3\n4\n9\n1\n. 0\n8\n8\n7\n1\n0\n. 5\n4\n7\n6\n5\n0\n. 0\n6\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n8\n0\n0\n. 1\n8\n0\n. 4\n8\n1\n9\n5\n0\n. 1\n8\n0\n. 9\n3\n4\n0\n2\n. 7\n1\n. 4\n3\n9\n8\n. 7\n3\n9\n9\n. 3\nZ\n3\n0\n. 8\n1\n6\n7\n3\n0\n. 3\n1\n9\n4\n0\n2\n0\n. 5\n4\n6\n9\n2\n0\n. 0\n7\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n7\n6\n0\n. 1\n9\n0\n. 4\n8\n0\n8\n2\n0\n. 2\n1\n0\n. 9\n0\n3\n9\n9\n. 6\n2\n. 0\n3\n9\n8\n. 5\n3\n9\n8\n. 6\nZ\n5\n1\n. 0\n1\n1\n9\n9\n1\n. 7\n2\n8\n4\n7\n0\n. 5\n4\n7\n0\n9\n0\n. 0\n9\n0\n. 0\n6\n3\n8\n1\n0\n. 1\n7\n0\n. 4\n8\n1\n3\n0\n0\n. 1\n7\n0\n. 8\n9\n4\n0\n0\n. 4\n1\n. 9\n3\n9\n8\n. 7\n4\n0\n0\n. 0\nA\nll\ne\nrr\no\nrs\na\nre\n2\ns\n(p\ne\nr\nc\ne\nn\nt\nfo\nr\nra\nti\no\ns\n;\na\nb\ns\no\nlu\nte\nfo\nr\na\ng\ne\ns\n).\n*\nC\no\nrr\ne\nc\nte\nd\nfo\nr\nb\nla\nn\nk\nP\nb\n,\nU\na\nn\nd\nc\no\nm\nm\no\nn\nP\nb\n.6\n7\n{ M\ne\na\ns\nu\nre\nd\nra\nti\no\n,\nc\no\nrr\ne\nc\nte\nd\nfo\nr\ns\np\nik\ne\na\nn\nd\nP\nb\nfr\na\nc\nti\no\nn\na\nti\no\nn\n.\n{ T\no\nta\nl\nc\no\nm\nm\no\nn\nP\nb\nin\na\nn\na\nly\ns\nis\n,\nc\no\nrr\ne\nc\nte\nd\nfo\nr\ns\np\nik\ne\na\nn\nd\nfr\na\nc\nti\no\nn\na\nti\no\nn\n(0\n?0\n5\n%\n\/a\nm\nu\n).\nSelby et al. Geochronology and fluid inclusion studies of molybdenite mineralisation\nApplied Earth Science (Trans. Inst. Min. Metall. B) 2008 VOL 117 NO 1 17\nFluid inclusions\nThe fluid inclusion petrographic study adopted the\nconcept of fluid inclusion assemblages (FIA) described\nby Goldstein,27 an approach that places fluid inclusions\ninto assemblages interpreted to have been trapped at\naround the same time. Three types (types 1, 2 and 3) of\naqueous fluid inclusion have been recognised in all three\nsamples based on phases present at room temperature\nand their microthermometric behaviour (Table 3 and\nFig. 6). Type 1 inclusions are vapour-rich, degree of fill\nF is 0?18\u20130?62 (F5 vol. liquid\/vol. liquidzvapour).\nType 2 are liquid rich, F50?47\u20130?87. The majority of\ntypes 1 and 2 fluid inclusions form trails that do not\ncrosscut crystal boundaries and are classified here as\npseudosecondary based on the criteria of McCandless\net al.40 In addition, a number of types 1 and 2 inclusions\nare hosted in clusters within the cores of quartz crystals.\nThe authors interpret types 1 and 2 to constitute one\nFIA in each of the quartz vein samples from Shap and\nSkiddaw. In the Weardale pegmatite vein, the vapour\nrich type 1 inclusions are uncommon and type 2\ninclusions invariably occur in annealed fractures without\ntype 1.\nThe temperature of the first ice melting TFM in type 1\n(only recorded in the Skiddaw sample) and type 2\ninclusions occurs between 219?5 and 223?7uC indicat-\ning the dominant presence of NaCl in solution. The\ntemperature of last ice melting TLM in types 1 and 2\ninclusions (from 20?1 to 25?2uC) was used to calculate\nfluid salinities in equivalent wt-%NaCl (eq. wt-%NaCl).\nThe range of salinities for types 1 and 2 are broadly\nsimilar, i.e. 0?2\u20138?1 eq. wt-%NaCl (Table 3).\nIn both the Shap and Skiddaw vein samples (DS1-06\nand DS4-06), clathrate melting between z5?8 and\nz10uC was observed in some type 1 (DS1-06 only)\nand type 2 inclusions. This indicates the presence of non-\naqueous phases in types 1 and 2 inclusions (see the\nsection on \u2018Laser Raman microspectroscopy\u2019), which\ncan affect calculated fluid salinities.30 Clathrate melting\ntemperatures and bulk fluid inclusion composi-\ntions were used to calculate fluid salinities of 3?3 to\n4?7 eq.wt-%NaCl, within the range calculated from TLM\nvalues.\nHomogenisation to the vapour phase takes place\nbetween 312?4 and 445?6uC in type 1 inclusions, whereas\nin type 2, homogenisation is to the liquid phase and\ntakes place between 246 and 425uC (Fig. 7 and Table 3).\nOn heating and before homogenisation, several types 1\nand 2 inclusions in all samples decrepitated between\n230?4 and 438?6uC (Table 3).\nType 3 fluid inclusions are liquid rich, F5 0?71\u20130?99,\nand unlike types 1 and 2, occur along annealed fractures\nthat cross-cut crystal boundaries and are considered to\nbe secondary in origin. They occur in all three vein\nsamples. Their TFM values range between 219?4 and\n225?2uC, thus are interpreted to reflect the dominance\nof NaCl in solution. TLM values range from 20?2 to\n24?9uC, yielding salinity values between 0?4 and 7?7 eq.\nwt-%NaCl (Fig. 8). Homogenisation to the liquid phase\noccurs between 86?6 and 296?7uC.\nLaser Raman microspectroscopy\nLaser Raman microspectroscopy (LRM) of types 1 and\n2 inclusions in the three vein samples from the Shap,\nSkiddaw and Weardale granites revealed the presence, in\n5 U\u2013Pb zircon Concordia plot for the Skiddaw granite\nSelby et al.

The Re\u2013Os ages suggest\nthat magmatism and mineralisation occurred contem-\nporaneously and ,8 m.y. earlier than previously con-\nsidered (Fig. 2). The previous U\u2013Pb, Rb\u2013Sr and K\u2013Ar\nage determinations likely reflect disturbance to the\nisotope systematics. The latter maybe accounted for by\nthe alteration of matrix megacrysts, plagioclase and\nbiotite to sericite and chlorite respectively, which is not\nobserved in megacrysts within enclaves.10 Remarkably,\ngiven the employed analytical protocols at the time, the\nrecalculated 1964 Re\u2013Os molybdenite age31 is within\nuncertainty of the new Re\u2013Os age (Fig. 2).\nThe new Re\u2013Os molybdenite age (405 Ma) allows for\nthe reinterpretation of a recent Rb\u2013Sr dataset from a\nsingle plagioclase-rimmed K-feldspar megacryst within a\nmafic inclusion (enclave).13 The isochronous behaviour\nof the Rb\u2013Sr data (405\u00a12 Ma), which requires the\nsample set to possess identical initial Sr isotope\ncompositions, was not considered to reflect the timing\nof emplacement of the granite because the K\u2013Ar\n(397\u00a17 Ma) and U\u2013Pb (390\u00a16 Ma) determinations\nwere considered reliable.13 Subsequently, the Rb\u2013Sr data\nwere used to show that the initial Sr isotope composition\nat 397 Ma of the K-feldspar (0?70762 and 0?70767) was\nmore radiogenic than the plagioclase rim (0?70722 and\n0?70739). This feature was considered to reflect that the\nK-feldspar formed in a more evolved granitic magma\nand interacted with a less evolved, mafic magma during\nthe crystallisation of plagioclase, supporting magma\nmixing events.10 However, the initial Sr isotope compo-\nsitions calculated at 405 Ma (Sr405Ma) are almost\nidentical (core inner: 0?70713, outer core: 0?70714, inner\nrim: 0?70713, outer rim: 0?70716), which match two of\nthe three Sr405Ma values for a K-feldspar megacryst in a\nbasic enclave reported by Cox et al.10 As a result, the\nSr405Ma data demonstrate that there was only minor Sr\nisotopic heterogeneity in the magmas associated with the\nShap granite and that the initial Sr composition is less\nradiogenic (more juvenile) than previous determinations\n(cf. 0?70767).71 This re-interpretation of the Rb\u2013Sr data\nfurther stresses that the absolute age and its uncertainty\nfor granite emplacement is critical when applying Rb\u2013Sr\ndata to calculate initial isotopic compositions to\nevaluate magma sources and processes in ancient\nsystems.14,63\nThe Skiddaw granite\nThe emplacement age for the Skiddaw granite is given\nby a zircon concordia age of 398?8\u00a10?4 Ma (Fig. 5).\nThis is in agreement with previous age constraints;\nhowever, it is considerably more precise: 398\u00a18 Ma for\nRb\u2013Sr K-feldspar from greisen-altered granite,52 and\n399\u00a16 Ma for K\u2013Ar biotite9 (Fig. 4). Molybdenite\nfrom a quartz\u2013molybdenite\u2013pyrite\u2013chalcopyrite vein\npost-dating pervasive greisen alteration yields a Re\u2013Os\nage of 392?3\u00a12?8 Ma (Table 1). This age is within\nuncertainty of the K\u2013Ar ages for greisen muscovite\n(387\u00a14 Ma,52,59 and a Rb\u2013Sr fluid inclusion age of\n392\u00a15 Ma,62 determined from the analysis of early and\nlate stage quartz veins associated with sulphide miner-\nalisation. The Re\u2013Os age also agrees within uncertainty\nof a mean K\u2013Ar age (394\u00a18 Ma) interpreted to\nrepresent the final cooling of Skiddaw granite52,59\n(Fig. 3). Whole-rock Rb\u2013Sr analysis of altered granite\nyields a younger age (383\u00a14 Ma).\nThe disparity between U\u2013Pb and Re\u2013Os ages\n(398?8\u00a10?4 and 392?3\u00a12?8 Ma) suggests that the\nSkiddaw granite was emplaced several million years\n(,5 m.y.) before the sulphide mineralisation dated here.\nHowever, the Re\u2013Os age does not negate the Skiddaw\ngranite being the progenitor of the early stage (,0?5 m\nquartz Harding, Smith, Emerson veins) mineralisation\nof the Carrock W deposit.\nMagmatic-hydrothermal systems are typically only\nsustained by a single intrusive event for a maximum of\n800 k.y. and this duration drastically declines with an\nincrease in permeability of the country rock.11 However,\nminor chloritised magmatic biotite away from the\nmineralised zone (Sinen Gill) yield K\u2013Ar ages\n(392\u00a18 Ma) that nominally agree with the timing of\nmineralisation may reflect the final cooling of the\ngranite.59 Therefore, either the Skiddaw granite is a\nmore complex intrusion than exposed, representing\nmultiple magmatic-hydrothermal pulses or a separate\nhydrothermal (non-magmatic) pulse occurred at\n,392 m.y. as indicated by the Re\u2013Os age for sulphide\nmineralisation (see below).\nThe Weardale granite\nMolybdenite from a pre-aplite pegmatitic quartz vein\nyields a Re\u2013Os age of 398?3\u00a11?6 Ma. The Re\u2013Os age\nsuggests that the emplacement of the Weardale granite\nand mineralisation occurred ,10 m.y. later than pre-\nviously determined based on Rb\u2013Sr wholerock analy-\nsis.32 The age for the aplite are based on determinations\nof one sample using the Sr initial composition\n(0?706\u00a10?002) from the regression of the granite\nwholerock data (390\u00a18 Ma.32 However, this age is\nbased on one of two reported present day 87Sr\/86Sr\nvalues (0?8656\u00a10?0028). The second 87Sr\/86Sr value\n(0?8683\u00a10?0014), not discussed,32 yields an apparent\nage of 397\u00a18 Ma.

In addition,\nthough within uncertainty, the reporting of two present\nday 87Sr\/86Sr values (DH7, 11)32 may suggest some\nuncertainty in the Sr data reported by Holland and\nLambert32 and subsequently the determined Rb\u2013Sr age\nfor the Weardale granite.\nFluids (types 1\u20133) in the Mo-bearing veins from\nShap, Skiddaw and Weardale granites\nThe Mo-bearing veins from each of the three granites\ncontain a similar range of fluid inclusion types, i.e. types\n1\u20133. Microthermometry of all three types indicates\nsimilar fluid salinities that range between ,0 and\n,8 eq. wt-%NaCl. TH histograms (Fig. 7) for types 1\u2013\n3 fluid inclusions indicate a progressive decrease in\nhomogenisation temperatures from type 1 (,450uC)\nthrough to type 3 (,150uC). Bivariate plots of TH versus\nsalinity, however, show no obvious correlations between\nsalinity and homogenisation temperatures (Fig. 8).\nSignificant differences in fluid compositions between\nthe three veins are revealed, however, by combining the\nLRM data with the microthermometric data.\nVapour-rich type 1 and liquid-rich type 2 inclusions in\nthe Shap and Skiddaw veins are found in the same FIA\nand TH measurements from coexisting types 1 and 2\ninclusions are identical (\u00a110uC). This suggests that\ntypes 1 and 2 inclusions were trapped from immiscible\nfluids (i.e. boiling) during vein emplacement and Mo\nmineralisation.\nThe non-aqueous phases in types 1 and 2 inclusions\nfrom the Shap vein are dominated by CO2 (89?5\u2013\n99 mol.-%) with low abundances of N2 (,10 mol.-%)\nand CH4 (,1 mol.-%; Table 3 and Fig. 9). The presence\nof CO2 combined with the low levels of N2 in these fluids\n(mean54?5 mol.-%) suggests that these fluids are mag-\nmatic in origin.33 A predominant magmatic origin for\nmineralising fluids is also supported by L34S values for\nsulphide minerals from 21 toz5\u00f8,36 consistent with I-\ntype magmas.37\nThe types 1 and 2 inclusions in the Skiddaw vein\ncontain relatively high abundances of CH4 (up to\n15 mol.-%) and N2 (up to 44 mol.-%) in comparison to\nthe Shap vein (Table 3 and Fig. 8). The high N2 content\nin these fluids indicates an influx of metamorphic\nfluids.33 Nitrogen enrichment is also a feature in the\ngreisen altered Skiddaw Granite and this together with\nthe recorded decrease in countryrock N2 from\n.800 ppm (2?5 km away from the contact) to\n,410 ppm ,0?5 km from the contact5 is further\nevidence of countryrock involvement in fluid composi-\ntions. The latter may also be suggested by the sub-ppm\nRe concentrations [0?75 ppm (0?47 ppm 187Re), Table 1]\nin molybdenite from the Carrock deposit (DS4-06). For\nexample, low Re-bearing (,5 ppm) molybdenite asso-\nciated with W and Sn mineralisation is common to\nmetamorphic-related environments and ore-fluids.60\nHowever, molybdenite associated with magmatic-related\nmineral systems typically has high Re concentrations\n(tens to thousands of ppm) (cf. Refs. 40 and 56, and\nreferences therein,4,60 and references therein and the\nShap and Weardale granites of this study).\na trapping conditions of types 1 and 2 inclusions in\nsamples DS1-06 (Shap) and DS4-06 (Skiddaw): shaded\narea represents estimated trapping pressures; trapping\nconditions calculated according to the equation of\nstate of Ref. 18; b isochores constructed from indivi-\ndual type 2 FIA in sample SSK0576 (Weardale)\n10 Pressure\u2013temperature space showing trapping tem-\nperatures and pressures for types 1 and 2 inclusions:\narrow represents isobaric cooling during fluid evolu-\ntion; FIA (1): TH5395uC, salinity54?65 eq. wt-%NaCl;\nFIA (2): TH5380uC, salinity54?96 eq. wt-%NaCl; FIA\n(3): TH5350uC, salinity52 eq. wt-%NaCl; FIA (4):\nTH5300uC, salinity50?18 eq. wt-%NaCl; FIA (5):\nTH5290uC, salinity51?57 eq. wt-%NaCl\n9 CO2 v.

Geochronology and fluid inclusion studies of molybdenite mineralisation\nApplied Earth Science (Trans. Inst. Min. Metall. B) 2008 VOL 117 NO 1 23\nType 1 inclusions are very rare in the Weardale\ngranite\u2019s Mo-bearing quartz pegmatite vein. The type 2\ninclusions invariably occur in annealed fractures.\nFurthermore, the lack of obvious clathration in types 1\nand 2 inclusions coupled with the LRM data for type 2\ninclusion fluids indicates significant differences in their\nfluid composition to those recorded in the Shap and\nSkiddaw veins. However, the types 1 and 2 inclusions\nare found in pseudosecondary trails and represent fluids\npresent during the crystallisation of this pegmatite. As\ntype 1 inclusions make up only ,3% of the total fluid\ninclusion population, fluid boiling in the Weardale\ngranite was relatively minor and this may be related to\nthe lack of gaseous species within mineralising fluids (as\nindicated by LRM). Based on the petrographic setting of\ntype 2 inclusions, they are interpreted as representing\nlate-stage magmatic fluids containing little or no non-\naqueous species.\n11 Diagram showing the timing relationships between magmatism () and mineralisation (f5molybdenite, &5sulphide)\nacross the northern England and Irish sector of the Appalachian-Caledonian orogen: timing of the main Acadian\ndeformation front is pre-405 Ma, but was episodic throughout the Emsian; magmatism in the north of the Iapetus\nsuture was initiated when orogen parallel structures (e.g. Great Glen and Southern Upland Faults) were active;68 time-\nscale after Gradstein et al.29\nSelby et al. Geochronology and fluid inclusion studies of molybdenite mineralisation\n24 Applied Earth Science (Trans. Inst. Min. Metall. B) 2008 VOL 117 NO 1\nThe salinities of type 3 inclusion fluids from all three\nveins are similar to the salinities of types 1 and 2\ninclusion fluids. However, their homogenisation tem-\nperatures are relatively low (Fig. 8). Furthermore, type 3\ninclusions are confined to annealed fractures reflecting\nlower temperature fluid influxes that may be meteoric in\norigin and similar to meteoric fluids recorded in other\nlate-Caledonian granites.12,24,49\nP\u2013T modelling of fluid trapping conditions\nThe presence of vapour-rich (type 1) and liquid-rich\n(type 2) inclusions in the Shap and Skiddaw veins may\nreflect fluid boiling. This may also be true in the case of\nthe Weardale vein although type 1 inclusions are rare. If\nit is assumed that boiling occurred in the Shap and\nSkiddaw veins, then TH equates to the true trapping\ntemperature TT of the fluids. In addition, trapping\npressures of inclusions can be calculated using the\nvolume and bulk composition of fluids (Table 3).\nTrapping temperatures and pressures of types 1 and 2\ninclusions in the Shap and Skiddaw veins were\ncalculated18 and are plotted in Fig. 10a. Calculated\ntrapping pressures (assuming a hydrostatic pressure\ngradient of 98?1 bar km21;61 for the Shap and\nSkiddaw, veins\u2019 inclusions are between 300 and 620 bars\n(3\u20136?3 km) and 375\u2013475 bars (3?8\u20134?9 km) respectively.\nThese emplacement depths are consistent with fluid\ninclusion data from wolframite-bearing quartz veins in\nthe Skiddaw granite, which indicates that mineralisation\noccurred at depths .1?4 km.3\nThe rarity of vapour-rich type 1 inclusions in the\nWeardale vein is considered to reflect the absence of\nboiling and therefore, a pressure correction is required to\ndetermine the fluid trapping conditions. In Fig. 10b,\nisochores were constructed for individual type 2 FIA\nusing the program FLUIDS.2 Assuming that the\nWeardale granite was emplaced at a similar crustal level\nto the Shap and Skiddaw granites (3\u20136?3 km), then type 2\ninclusions were trapped at lithostatic pressures of 1\u2013\n1?7 kbars and were trapped at progressively lower\ntemperatures (about 650\u2013350uC) during isobaric cooling.\nImplications\nNew Re\u2013Os molybdenite ages indicate that emplace-\nment and mineralisation of the Shap, Skiddaw and\nWeardale granites occurred during the upper Early\nDevonian (Emsian) and not during the lower Middle\nDevonian (Eifelian) (Fig. 11). However, mineralisation\nassociated with the Carrock deposit (Skiddaw granite),\nin part, occurred during the Eifelian (Fig. 11).\nAdditionally, the Shap granite has long been recognised\nto post-date deformation (main cleavage development)\nas shown by contact metamorphic minerals, at several\nlocalities, occurring in random orientation across the\ncleavage of the country rocks.7 In contrast, in the\nSkiddaw, aureole andalusite both pre- and post-dates\nthe main cleavage.64 Previous attempts to constrain the\ntiming of the Acadian tectonometamorphic events have\nbeen less definitive in northern England and Wales\nbecause of: the range in Rb\u2013Sr, K\u2013Ar and Ar\u2013Ar ages;\nthe behaviour of the isotopic systems; and the inter-\npretation of the ages.17,21,22,43 Broadly, K\u2013Ar and Ar\u2013\nAr ages suggest apparent contemporaneous deformation\nat 400 Ma.17,21,22,43,65 The Re\u2013Os and U\u2013Pb ages of this\nstudy establish the non-synchronous development of\ncleavage of the Acadian deformation front in the Lake\nDistrict occurred before , 405 Ma (emplacement of the\nShap granite) and continued episodically throughout the\nEmsian (,398 Ma, Skiddaw granite; Fig. 11).\nThe broad timing and fluid characteristics of the\ngranite emplacement and Mo-mineralisation in the\nShap, Skiddaw and Weardale granites coincide with\nthat of the Irish sector of the C-AO (Fig. 11). For\nexample, combined fluid inclusion data and U\u2013Pb and\nRe\u2013Os geochronology have shown that granite-related\nmolybdenite mineralisation in the Connemara region\nwas accompanied by aqueous\u2013carbonic fluids in the\nOmey Granite at ,422 Ma and later, in the western\nsector of the Galway Batholith at ,410 Ma (Murvey)\nand ,407 Ma (Mace Head).25,28,49 Further magmatism\nand W\u2013Sn\u2013sulphide mineralisation is associated with the\n,405 Ma Leinster granite, SE Ireland.49,50\nThe diachronous granite emplacement between north-\nern England and Irish sector of the C-AO during the\nAcadian phase may relate to the oblique \u2018soft\u2019 collision\nplate convergence of eastern Avalonia with\nLaurentia15,66 associated with sinistral transtension\nduring the Emsian.15,65 For example, in the\nConnemara region, granite-related Mo-mineralisation\nsystems were initiated when orogen parallel structures\n(e.g. Great Glen and Southern Upland Faults) were\nactive.15 They continued as part of the stitching Galway\nBatholith\u2019s evolution (410\u2013380 Ma) when these major\nlineaments had ceased to be active.23 In contrast, south\nof the Iapetus suture granite systems of northwest\nEngland and southeast Ireland were emplaced following\nthe main Acadian deformation front.65\nConclusions\nMolybdenite Re\u2013Os and U\u2013Pb zircon geochronology\nand fluid inclusion data presented in this study define the\ntiming and fluid characteristics associated with sulphide\nmineralisation in the Lake District, and the nature and\nrelationship between mineralisation and magmatism.\nThe Re\u2013Os ages for mineralisation in the Shap\nGranite range are 405?2\u00a11?8 Ma (disseminated molyb-\ndenite) and 405?5\u00a11?7 Ma (vein-hosted molybdenite).\nThese ages are older than previously published U\u2013Pb,\nRb\u2013Sr and K\u2013Ar age constraints and indicate that\nmineralisation and magmatism occurred during the\nEmsian. Fluid inclusion analysis shows that mineralisa-\ntion in the Shap Granite is associated with the boiling of\nCO2-rich late magmatic fluids between 300 and 450uC,\nat hydrostatic pressures of between 440 and 620 bars.\nZircon U\u2013Pb geochronology yields an emplacement\nage of the Skiddaw granite at 398?8\u00a10?4 Ma.\nMolybdenite mineralisation that post-dates the main\nW mineralisation yields a Re\u2013Os age of 392?3\u00a12?8 Ma.\nThe non-aqueous compositions of mineralising fluids\nand Re concentrations in molybdenite are consistent\nwith a non-magmatic source for sulphide mineralisation,\nin contrast to earlier W mineralisation.3,59 Instead,\nmineralising fluids extensively interacted with the\nsurrounding country rocks, becoming enriched in\nisotopically heavy sulphur, N2 and CH4. The elevated\nnon-aqueous component of these fluids (up to 12?5 wt-%)\nfacilitated boiling between 275 and 400uC and at\nhydrostatic pressures of 375\u2013475 bars.\nMineralisation in the Weardale granite is hosted in a\nmolybdenite bearing quartz pegmatite vein, and yields a\nRe\u2013Os age of 398?3\u00a11?6 Ma. No evidence for fluid\nSelby et al. Geochronology and fluid inclusion studies of molybdenite mineralisation\nApplied Earth Science (Trans. Inst. Min. Metall.

Acadian deformation was episodic\nand diachronous beginning before the emplacement of\nthe Shap Granite at ,405 Ma, and continued episodi-\ncally throughout the Emsian (,398 Ma, emplacement\nof the Skiddaw granite). This study confirms the notion\nthat the timing of magmatism in northern England also\ncoincides with that of the Irish sector of Avalonia.\nAcknowledgements\nD.
