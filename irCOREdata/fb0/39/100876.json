INTRODUCTION\nAircraft engines of the future will operate at higher effi-\nciency and speed. Alloys based on molybdenum silicides are\npromising candidates for such applications owing to their\nhigh-temperature strength, environmental resistance, and low\ndensity. Monolithic MoSi2 has been studied extensively and\nhas been used in furnace heating elements for many years.\nWhile it has excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance,\nit suffers from catastrophic \u201cpest\u201d oxidation at intermediate\ntemperatures, spalling of its protective SiO surface layer dur-\ning thermal cycling, and insufficient room-temperature duc-\ntility and high-temperature creep strength for turbine blade\napplications.\nThere is experimental evidence that alloying MoSi2 with\nAl can improve the oxidation behavior, due to the formation\nof a dense Al2O3 surface layer,1,2 and, in low concentrations,\nthat it can improve the room-temperature ductility.3\u20135 The\nductilizing effect of Al, which has also been predicted by ab\ninitio calculations,6 is often attributed to Al weakening the\nMouSi bonds and introducing a more metallic nature to the\nbonding. With increasing Al additions MosSi1\u2212xAlxd2 alloys\ntransform from C11b through C40 to C54 crystal structures\nssee Fig. 1d.7\u20139 In a previous study we showed that these\ntransformations are driven, via the band energy, by the rela-\ntive shape of the densities of states sDOSd of the topologi-\ncally similar C11b, C40, and C54 structures.10\nThere is also interest in eutectic alloys such as\nMoSi2uMo5Si3 and Mo5Si3uMo3Si and multiphase\nMouSiuB alloys, containing the Mo3Si sA15d and Mo5Si3\nsD8md phases ssee Fig. 1d, which may have better room- and\nhigh-temperature mechanical properties than the monolithic\nsilicides.11\u201313 The A15 and D8m crystal structures are related\nthrough a Hyde rotation under which identical structural\nunits are rotated through an angle p \/4 sRef. 14d. The bond-\ning environments and the resultant DOS of Mo3Si and\nMo5Si3 are thus similar and are dominated by nearest-\nneighbor MouMo and MouSi bonds in contrast to the\ndisilicides which have nearest-neighbor MouSi and SiuSi\nbonds.15\nIn this study we investigate the electronic structure of\nvarious MouSisuAld alloys using valence-band x-ray pho-\ntoelectron spectroscopy sVBXPSd, which gives a spectrum\nroughly proportional to the occupied DOS. While this signal\nobviously contains information about the bonding in the ma-\nterial, the angular momentum character of the electronic\nstates, which is necessary knowledge for a simple chemical\npicture of the bonding,16 is hidden. The spectrum may also\ndiffer in structure from the ground-state DOS to an unknown\ndegree due to the influence of the valence hole left by the\nejected photoelectron. It is useful, therefore, to compare\nVBXPS spectra with electronic structure calculations based\non density-functional theory sDFTd, which, in addition to the\nFIG. 1.

In this paper, using just such a combination\nof experiments and theory, we focus on the effect of Al con-\ncentration along the pseudobinary MosSi1\u2212xAlxd2 and the or-\ndered binary phases MoSi2, Mo3Si, and Mo5Si3.\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nA. Alloy preparation and characterization\nWe produced alloys with nominal compositions listed in\nTable I by clean arc melting and casting in water-cooled\ncopper crucibles using Mo pellets of 99.7% purity, small\npieces of polycrystalline Si of 99.99% purity, and Al bars of\n99.99% purity.\nWe measured the compositions of the as-cast alloys using\nelectron probe microanalysis sEPMAd on a Jeol JXA 8600\nSuperprobe equipped with an Oxford Instruments ISIS\nenergy-dispersive x-ray detector. Measurements performed\nover large areas of the ingots revealed deviations of less than\n2 at. % from the nominal compositions ssee Table Id.\nThe phase constitution and microstructures were studied\nusing a combination of x-ray diffraction sXRDd and EPMA.\nXRD measurements were made using a Cu Ka source and a\nPhillips Diffractometer scanning 2u between 20\u00b0 and 120 at\n1\u00b0 \/min, step size 0.1\u00b0. The main phases present are summa-\nrized in Table I. In addition to the main phase, because of the\nsmall deviations from the nominal compound compositions,\nmost alloys had small quantities of secondary phase present:\nalloy 1 had approximately 15 vol % D8m, alloy 2 approxi-\nmately 10 vol % A15, alloy 3 less than 5 vol % D8m, alloy 4\nless than 5 vol % C11b, alloy 6 less than 10 vol % Mo3Al8,\nand alloy 7 less than 5 vol % C40.\nB. Valence-band XPS\nThe Al Ka shn=1486.6 eVd monochromated source\navailable on the Scienta ESCA 300 spectrometer at the Na-\ntional Centre for Electron Spectroscopy and Surface Analysis\nsNCESSd, CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, was used to acquire\nvalence-band spectra. The samples were mechanically milled\nin situ prior to analysis.17 The spectra were acquired with\nanalyzer pass energy of 150 eV on 0.8-mm entrance slits and\nstep size 0.05 eV with the sample surface normal to the ana-\nlyzer electron optics. The instrumental resolution was\n0.35 eV. Both the data acquisition and subsequent analysis\nwere performed using the PC-based SCIENTA software. Peaks\nwere fitted using Voigt functions on a Shirley background\nwith both the peaks and background being optimized during\nthe peak fitting process.\nC. Electronic structure calculations\nWe carried out self-consistent tight-binding linear muffin\ntin orbital18 sTB-LMTOd calculations for the ordered phases\nMoSi2 sC11bd, Mo5Si3, and Mo3Si using experimentally de-\ntermined crystal parameters.19 For the MosSi1\u2212xAlxd2 alloys\nwe used the spin-polarized relativistic Korringa-Kohn-\nRostocker sSPRKKRd code.20,21 The sSi,Ald sublattice was\nconsidered to be randomly substituted and treated within the\nself consistent coherent potential approximation sCPAd.22\nAll the calculations were carried out using a minimal\nsspdd basis set and well-converged k-point sets. In each case\nwe calculated the total, Mo d, Si p, and, where appropriate,\nAl p DOS. The SPRKKR calculations were carried out in fully\nrelativistic mode. For the purpose of comparison with the\nexperimental data we simulated VBXPS spectra by adding a\nphenomenological, energy-dependent broadening to the oc-\ncupied part of the total DOS using a Lorentzian function\nwith full width at half maximum D=0.5 eV+0.1uEu, where E\nis the energy relative to the Fermi energy in eV.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Mo\u0084Si1\u2212xAlx\u00852 calculations\nThe calculated partial DOS for MosSi1\u2212xAlxd2 in the C11b,\nC40, and C54 structures is shown in Fig. 2. The three struc-\ntures consist essentially of different stacking sequences of\nhexagonal layers: C11b has ABAB stacking, C40 ABCABC\nstacking, and C54 ABCDABCD stacking. Examining the to-\ntal and partial DOS of the three structures at zero Al content\nsx=0d one sees that this structural similarity leads to a simi-\nlar DOS structure: a dominant nearest-neighbor Mo-d-Si-p\nhybridization peak around or just below \u22123 eV, a smaller\nnearest-neighbor Si-p-Si-p hybridization peak around\n\u22126 eV, and a small second-nearest-neighbor Mo-d-Mo-d\nTABLE I.

For simplicity,\nin the remainder of the discussion we shall refer to the Mo d\nstates as d and the Si p states, correspondingly, as p.\nFrom a chemical bonding point of view, since a given\natom has the same number and type of first and second near-\nest neighbors in any of the three structures, the differences in\nthe DOS between C11b, C40, and C54 must arise from the\nangular dependence of the bond order rather than pairwise\ninteractions as we demonstrated using a tight-binding model\nin a previous study.10 In agreement with our previous find-\nings for x=0 we observe the largest changes going from\nC11b to C40 and smaller ones going from C40 to C54. The\ntrends are a broadening of the main p-d peak and the smaller\np-p peak in C11b, which becomes more of a shoulder in C40\nand C54, and an enhancement of the d-d shoulder in C11b,\nwhich becomes a well defined peak in C40 and C54.\nThe behavior observed with increasing Al content sin-\ncreasing xd is essentially a rigid band effect: the DOS struc-\nture changes little and the Fermi energy sEFd moves down,\nrelatively speaking, due to the reduced electron concentra-\ntion. The notable exception is the case of C11b where the d\n-d shoulder becomes a steadily more pronounced peak with\nincreasing Al. This change with Al concentration is not seen\nin C40 and C54 for which the d-d states are an isolated peak\nalready at x=0. In a previous paper we showed that the\nsecond-nearest-neighbor dds interaction contributes signifi-\ncantly to the stability of the C11b structure relative to C40.10\nIn other words, the d-d states have a less bonding sor more\nnonbondingd nature in C40 than they do in C11b. Hence, we\ninfer that the appearance of the isolated d-d peak in the C11b\nDOS is symptomatic of these states acquiring a more non-\nbonding nature with increasing Al concentration. However,\nthis effect only becomes significant above the concentration\nat which C11b MoSi2 becomes unstable and thus is probably\nnot relevant to the discussion of bonding and mechanical\nproperties which follows.\nDiscounting the small effect described above for C11b,\nour calculations suggest that non-rigid-band effects are not\nimportant in describing the changes in the bonding as a func-\ntion of Al concentration for a given structure. In a previous\npublication we published a plot of the interatomic bond or-\nders for C11b MoSi2 versus electron concentration in a rigid\nband model sFig. 5 of Ref. 10d. The dominant contributions\nto the bond energy were all maximal at the electron concen-\ntration corresponding to MoSi2 and, of these, the most pro-\nnounced maximum was for the nearest-neighbor pds bond\nbetween Mo and Si. The reduction of electron concentration\ninduced by Al additions to the system will, therefore, inevi-\ntably decrease the strength of the covalent MouSi bonds,\nwhich should lead to more ductile behavior. Previous calcu-\nlations of a simple ductility criterion based on DFT total\nenergy calculations have borne this out.6 As to the question\nof whether the metallic nature of the bonding is increased, it\nis obvious from Fig. 2 that the total density of states at EF, a\ngood approximate measure of the metalicity, increases with\ndecreasing electron concentration. Hence, we find our results\nin good agreement with the received wisdom that addition of\nAl to MoSi2 weakens the MouSi bonds and introduces a\nmore metallic character to the system.\nB. MoASi calculations\nThe total and partial DOS for C11b MoSi2, D8m Mo5Si3,\nand A15 Mo3Si are shown in Fig. 3 and are in good agree-\nment with those published previously.15 The structure of the\nMoSi2 DOS has already been discussed in Sec. III A. The\nDOS of the A15 Mo3Si and D8m Mo5Si3 alloys are similar\ndue to the close relationship between their crystal structures.\nFIG. 2.

Nearest-neighbor p-d-hybridized states appear at lower\nenergies around \u22125 eV. Due to the greater number of\nMouMo nearest-neighbor bonds, the DOS of Mo3Si is\nmore skewed toward the high-energy region where the\nd-d-hybridized states appear.\nThere is a large gap of around 2 eV centered at \u22128 eV in\nthe DOS of Mo3Si and a pseudogap of a similar nature in the\nDOS of Mo5Si3. In both structures there is an isolated peak\nof predominantly Si s character near \u221210 eV, the center of\nweight of which is slightly lower in energy in the case of\nMo3Si. The isolation of the Si s peak from the rest of the\nDOS is due to the absence of SiuSi nearest neighbors in\nMo5Si3 and Mo3Si. The gap, or pseudogap in the case of\nMo5Si3, appears roughly where the p-p-hybridized peak ap-\npears in MoSi2. Without Si nearest neighbors to hybridize\nwith, the Si p states hybridize instead with abundant nearest-\nneighbor Mo d states and the Si 3s states, which have a\ndeep-lying on-site energy,15 appear isolated at \u221210 eV.\nC. Valence-band XPS\nThe experimental VBXPS spectra are displayed with\nthose simulated using the broadened total DOS from the cal-\nculations in Fig. 4.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 075114 s2005d\n075114-4\nInspecting the experimental results from the\nMosSi1\u2212xAlxd2 alloys the effect of the phase transformation\nfrom C11b to C40 can be seen clearly going from alloy 3 to\nalloy 4: the shoulder at EF is more enhanced in alloy 2, due\nto the sharp nonbonding d-d peak of the C40 DOS, and the\nmain p-d bonding peak is broader fcf. sC11b ,x=0.0d\n\u2192 sC40,x=0.1d in Fig. 2g. This is due to different angular\ncharacter in the p-d and p-p bond orders between C11b and\nC40. As we discussed in a previous paper the phase transfor-\nmation from C11b to C40 is driven by the reduced electron\nconcentration mainly through the nearest-neighbor MouSi\npdp bond energy difference between the two structures and,\nto a lesser extent, by the second-nearest-neighbor dds bond\nwhich was discussed in Sec. III A. In the isostructural alloys\n4\u20136 the quasi-rigid-band effect discussed in Sec. III A can be\nseen: there is a continuous rise in the shoulder at the top of\nthe valence band with Al concentration as EF shifts out of the\npseudogap and into the main peak and the width of the spec-\ntrum decreases fcf. C40 sx=0.1\u21920.5d in Fig. 2g. The phase\ntransformation from C40 to C54 between alloys 6 and 7 is\nbarely distinguishable in the experimental spectra but there is\na slight smoothing out of the bumps at \u22129 and \u22125.5 due again\nto a change in the angular character of the bonding fcf.\nsC40,x=0.5d\u2192 sC54,x=0.6d in Fig. 2g.\nThe differences between the experimental VBXPS spectra\nof MoSi2 salloy 3d and the other alloys, Mo5Si3 salloy 2d and\nMo3Si salloy 1d, are marked, reflecting the DOS structures\ndiscussed in Sec. III B. The skewing of the DOS toward EF\nin Mo3Si, relative to Mo5Si3, is noticeable in the experimen-\ntal spectrum as is the slightly lower energy of the Si s peak.\nThe agreement between the experimental and theoretical\nspectra is quite good in general. Practically all of the fine\nstructure in the experimental spectra is reproduced in the\ntheoretical ones although the positions of the peaks do not\nalways agree very well, particularly for Mo3Si and Mo5Si3.\nOne acknowledges that the broadened total occupied DOS\nmust be considered only a first approximation to the VBXPS\nspectrum. A rigorous treatment would require the calculation\nof the photocurrent starting from Fermi\u2019s golden rule,23\nwhich might result in some renormalization of the peak\nstructure as a function of energy and band character. Even\nthen, the perturbation caused by the valence hole would not\nbe taken into account, which may affect the distribution of\nstates significantly. This effect may explain the consistent\nunderestimation of the shoulder height at EF in all of the\nsimulated spectra.\nFinally, one must consider the nature of the XPS experi-\nment itself. Although the kinetic energies of the valence-\nband electrons are rather high s1470\u20131487 eVd, the depth of\nanalysis is still determined by the attenuation lengths of the\noutgoing electrons. The analysis depth, even at these kinetic\nenergies, will still be significantly less than 10 nm and one\nmust recall that the signal decays exponentially as a function\nof depth. In other words, the XPS analysis is very sensitive\nto surface condition. One obvious possibility for the discrep-\nancy between the experimental data is the presence of ad-\nsorbed oxygen, carbon, or other adventitious material on the\nsurface. This was not evident from the XPS survey spectra\nand, given the excellent agreement between experiment and\ntheory for some of the MouSiuAl alloys, this is not\nthought to be an issue. More likely it is due to slight devia-\ntions from the exact intermetallic composition which give\nrise to the minor components in the microstructure discussed\nin Sec. II A. This feature, and other variations in the compo-\nsition and stoichiometry at the surface, may well give rise to\nthe slight discrepancies observed between the experimental\nand the theoretical data in certain circumstances.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have investigated the electronic structure of\nMosSi1\u2212xAlxd2 and MouSi alloys using a combination of\nvalence-band XPS spectroscopy and density-functional\ntheory. We have explained the electronic origins of the fea-\ntures of the experimental spectra. In particular, for the\nMosSi1\u2212xAlxd2 alloys one sees, with increasing Al concentra-\ntion, a quasi-rigid-band effect as EF decreases and noticeable\nchanges in the shape of the spectrum as the stable phase\ntransforms from C11b to C40 and, to a lesser extent, to C54.\nBased purely on rigid band arguments, we conclude, in\nagreement with previous studies, that Al additions weaken\nthe MouSi bonds, which might explain the improved duc-\ntility found in Al-alloyed MoSi2.\nFor MoSi2, Mo5Si3, and Mo3Si with increasing Mo one\nobserves a broadening of the main peak due to nearest-\nneighbor d-d hybridization, increased d-d hybridization rela-\ntive to p-d resulting in skewing of DOS towards EF, and the\nappearance of an isolated Si 3s peak at \u221210 eV. The agree-\nment between the experimental and simulated spectra is\nquite good and, where it is less good, we have discussed\npossible reasons including possible shortcomings of the\ntheory and experimental setup.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank EPSRC for funding\nsGrant Nos.
