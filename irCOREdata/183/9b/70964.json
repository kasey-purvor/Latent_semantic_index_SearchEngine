To fund its open access policy, and to\nenable it to continue to serve the plant sciences community, Plant Methods will be introducing an\narticle processing charge (APC) from March 1st 2006. This charge will cover the costs of making\nthe article freely and universally accessible online and the costs involved in its inclusion in PubMed\nand its archiving in public repositories. In some circumstances, waivers of the APC may be granted\nand authors whose institutions are BioMed Central members will incur no, or reduced, charges.\nIntroduction\nPlant Methods is breaking new ground in plant science\npublishing by providing an open access outlet for refereed\narticles specifically devoted to technological innovation\nin plant biology. Plant Methods is published by BioMed\nCentral and all its content is universally and freely availa-\nble online to everyone, its authors retain copyright, and it\nis archived in PubMed Central [1].\nThe traditional model for scientific publishing is that\nreaders pay to access articles, either through subscriptions\nor by paying a fee each time they download an article.\nThese access charges inevitably limit how many will be\nable to read, use and cite the articles. Furthermore, while\nthe perception may be that traditional journals do not\ncharge authors for publication, it is common for them to\nlevy a fee for colour figures \u2013 and many additionally\nimpose page charges.\nWhy open access?\nOpen access changes the way in which articles are pub-\nlished. First, all articles become freely and universally\naccessible online, and so an author's work can be read by\nanyone at no cost. Second, the authors hold copyright for\ntheir work and grant anyone the right to reproduce and\ndisseminate the article, provided that it is correctly cited\nand no errors are introduced [1]. Third, a copy of the full\ntext of each article is permanently archived in an online\nrepository separate from the journal. Plant Methods' arti-\ncles are archived in PubMed Central [3], the US National\nLibrary of Medicine's full-text repository of life science lit-\nerature, and also in repositories at the University of Pots-\ndam [4] in Germany, at INIST [5] in France and in e-Depot\n[6], the National Library of the Netherlands' digital\narchive of all electronic publications.\nOpen access has four broad benefits for science and the\ngeneral public.\n\u2022 First, authors are assured that their work is disseminated\nto the widest possible audience, given that there are no\nbarriers to access their work. This is accentuated by the\nauthors being free to reproduce and distribute their work,\nfor example by placing it on their institution's website.\nPublished: 03 March 2006\nPlant Methods2006, 2:6 doi:10.1186\/1746-4811-2-6\nReceived: 23 February 2006\nAccepted: 03 March 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.plantmethods.com\/content\/2\/1\/6\n\u00a9 2006Forde and Roberts; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 2\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPlant Methods 2006, 2:6 http:\/\/www.plantmethods.com\/content\/2\/1\/6Open access journals reach a much larger set of readers\nthan any subscription-based journal, in print and online\n[7]. Some studies have suggested a correlation between\nopen access, higher downloads and higher citations, lead-\ning to a higher Impact Factor [8].\n\u2022 Second, the information available to readers will not be\nlimited by their library's budget, and the widespread avail-\nability of articles will enhance literature searching [9].\n\u2022 Third, the results of publicly funded research will be\naccessible to all taxpayers and not just those with access to\na library with a subscription. As such, open access could\nhelp to increase public interest in, and support of,\nresearch.\n\u2022 Fourth, a country's economy will not influence its\nresearchers' ability to access articles because resource-poor\ncountries (and institutions) will be able to read the same\nmaterial as wealthier ones.\nThe APC payment\nTo fund its open access policy, authors of articles accepted\nfor publication in Plant Methods will be asked to pay an\narticle-processing charge (APC) of \u00a3750. This will apply to\narticles submitted from March 1st 2006. These APCs will\nallow continued open access to all of Plant Methods' arti-\ncles. Waiver requests will be considered by the Editor-in-\nChief on a case-by-case basis. If an author is affiliated to a\nBMC member institute, the institute will cover all or a por-\ntion of the APC. Current member institutions are listed\nhere http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/inst\/. No charge is\nmade for articles that are rejected after peer review. Many\nfunding agencies have also realized the importance of\nopen access publishing and have specified that their\ngrants may be used directly to pay APCs http:\/\/\nwww.biomedcentral.com\/info\/authors\/apcfaq#grants.\nWhat the APC covers\nThe APC pays for efficient and thorough peer review, for\nthe article to be freely and universally accessible in various\nformats online, and for the processes required for inclu-\nsion in PubMed and archiving in PubMed Central, e-\nDepot, Potsdam and INIST. Although \u00a3750 may seem\nexpensive, it must be remembered that (unlike other jour-\nnals) Plant Methods will not levy additional page or colour\ncharges, which in other journals can easily exceed \u00a3750.\nIndeed, with the article being published online only, any\nnumber of colour figures and photographs can be\nincluded, at no extra cost.\nFree access versus open access\nAlthough several journals now offer free access to their\narticles online, this is different from open access (as\ndefined by the Bethesda Statement [10]). Journals often\ndelay free access for 6\u201312 months, and even when the full\ntext is available, readers are not allowed to reproduce and\/\nor disseminate the work because of restrictions imposed\nby the copyright policy. That said, Plant Methods and other\nBioMed Central journals are not alone in the move to\nopen access funded by APCs. For example, the Public\nLibrary of Science has set up new open access journals,\nand have elected to set APCs of US$1500 for each\naccepted article [11]. Given that the Public Library of Sci-\nence has used television advertising to promote journals\n[12], the high profile of these journals will raise awareness\nof open access and encourage researchers in all disciplines\nto understand and accept open access, with APCs as an\nacceptable method to fund it.\nConclusion\nIt is only through the instigation of article processing\ncharges that Plant Methods will be able to continue serving\nthe community of plant biologists by promoting techno-\nlogical innovation in the plant sciences. If you have\nrecently devised a novel protocol or research tool that you\nthink may be of value to other plant biologists, we invite\nyou to support this exciting new initiative by submitting\nyour paper to Plant Methods.\nAbbreviations\nAPC = article-processing charge.\nReferences\n1.
