To date, international seismic codes [1,2] do not give a method for generating the \ntime-histories imposing only the matching of the mean simulated response spectrum \nwith the target one according to certain spectrum compatible criteria. As a consequence, \nseveral methods have been proposed in literature coping with the generation of spec-\ntrum compatible accelerograms. Earlier contributions on this subject can be found in \n[3]. Based on either a deterministic or stochastic approaches two main parallel strategies \nare usually adopted for defining suitable earthquake time histories. Namely, based on a \ndeterministic approach the spectrum compatible accelerogram is usually determined via \nan iterative alteration of the frequency content of synthetic or recorded time-histories. In \nreference [4] a single spectrum compatible accelerogram using an artificial deterministic \nsignal resulting by the superposition of a number of harmonics with amplitude scaled so \nas to mach the target response spectrum has been determined. Neural network based ap-\nproach for generating accelerograms through the knowledge of the inverse mapping \nfrom response spectra to earthquake accelerograms is proposed in [5]. Wavelet-based \nmethods modifying recorded accelerograms such that those are compatible with a given \nresponse spectrum can be found in [6-8].  \nDeterministic-based approach possesses the advantage to lead generally to spectrum \ncompatible accelerograms nonstationary in both amplitude and frequency; on the other \nhand it suffers the major drawback to produce a single spectrum compatible accelero-\ngram from and individual recorded signal. Therefore since for design purpose it is re-\n 3\nquired [1,2] the use of a number of accelerograms the application of a deterministic ap-\nproach could be prohibitive whereas few records are allowable. \nFurthermore, being the response spectrum determined smoothing and averaging the \nresponse spectra pertinent to a number of recorded signals and due to the widely recog-\nnized random nature of the seismic action, stochastic approach appears more attractive. \nIn this regard, many common approaches rely on modeling the seismic action as a reali-\nzation of a stationary or quasi-stationary stochastic process. Moreover, in the framework \nof stochastic dynamics, spectral representation of random processes is usually preferred. \nAccordingly, by modeling the seismic input as a stationary Gaussian process, the spec-\ntrum compatible power spectral density is first determined. Vanmarcke and Gasparini \n[9] pointed-out the fundamental relationship between the response spectrum and the \npower spectral density of the input via the so-called \u201cfirst passage problem\u201d. Based on \nthis relationship various procedures have been proposed in literature for determining the \nspectrum compatible power spectral density. (see e.g. ref. [9-18]). An iterative scheme \nto generate seismic ground motion time histories at several location on the ground sur-\nface that are compatible with prescribed response spectra correlated according to a giv-\nen coherence function has been proposed in [19]. After determining the power spectral \ndensity of the base acceleration, samples of spectrum compatible time histories can be \nsimulated through the superposition of harmonics with random phase [20]. Even if the \nabove described approaches represent the seismic action reliably reflecting its inherent \nrandom nature, it suffers the major drawback of neglecting the nonstationary characte-\nristics of the real records.  Remarkably, it is well known that the dynamic response of \nnonlinear structures is highly influenced by the nonstationary behavior of the input \n[21,22]. Thus, more reliable simulations have to take into account the time variability of \n 4\nboth intensity and frequency content of the ground motion. Considering an earthquake \ntime history as a realization of a nonstationary stochastic process Spanos and Vargas \nLoli [23] derived an approximate analytical expression of the spectrum compatible evo-\nlutionary power spectrum. The simulated time-histories are iteratively adjusted a post-\neriori in order to match the response spectrum. Generation of nonseparable artificial \nearthquake accelerograms has been also proposed in [24]. The method assume an em-\npirical model of the evolutionary power spectral density function possessing the feature \nthat high frequency component are magnified in the early part of the process and the \niterative correction of the simulated accelerograms. Nonstationary characteristics from \nrecorded earthquakes have been taken into account in [25] by means of phase spectrum \nfor generating spectrum compatible signals. Ensemble of spectrum compatible accele-\nrograms using stochastic neural networks has been proposed in [26]. Recently, the pro-\ncedure originally established in Spanos and Vargas Loli [23] has been modified by Gia-\nralis and Spanos [27] by means of the use of harmonic wavelets transform for iteratively \nimprove the matching between the target and the simulated response spectra.  \nIn this paper a method based on the spectral representation of stochastic processes is \nproposed. The method assumes that the ground motion is modeled by the superposition \nof two contributions: the first one is a fully-nonstationary counterpart modeled by a rec-\norded earthquake, that takes into account the time variability of both intensity and fre-\nquency content; the second one is a corrective term represented by a quasi-stationary \nprocess adjusting the response spectrum of the nonstationary signal in order to make it \nspectrum compatible. Remarkably, the simulated earthquakes do not require any further \niterative correction leading the proposed procedure very handy and competitive from a \ncomputational point of view. Therefore, the influence of the corrective term on the non-\n 5\nstationary behavior of the original recorded signal has been scrutinized via a pertinent \nstudy of the mean instantaneous energy and frequency of the spectrum compatible \nearthquakes. Various examples show the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed \nmethod. \n \n2 GENERATING QUASI-STATIONARY SPECTRUM COMPATIBLE \nEARTHQUAKES \nAssume that a target pseudo-acceleration response spectrum 0( , )RSA \uf077 \uf07a (for a given \nnatural frequency, 0\uf077 , and damping ratio, \uf07a ) is specified. The problem of simulating \nspectrum compatible earthquakes is addressed on a probabilistic basis under the as-\nsumption that an earthquake time history is considered as a realization of a random \nprocess. In this section the simplest hypothesis of zero-mean stationary Gaussian ran-\ndom process, fully defined by the so-called power spectral density function, is assumed. \nAccordingly, the problem is recast to determine the power spectral density function \nwhose response spectrum match the target one. This can be pursued via the following \nfirst crossing problem [9]  \n2\n0 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 0, 0( , ) ( , 0.5; ( , ), ( , ), ( , )) ( , ) ,U s U U U URSA T p\uf077 \uf07a \uf03d \uf077 \uf068 \uf03d \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a    (1) \nwhere U\uf068  is the peak factor given by the equation \n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d1 22ln 2 1 ln 2.U U U UN exp N\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf068 \uf03d \uf02d \uf02d\uf064 \uf070\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0eb \uf0fb\uf0eb \uf0fb ,               (2) \nwith \n 6\n\uf028 \uf029 12, 0\n0, 0\n( , )\nln\n2 ( , )\nUs\nU\nU\nTN p \uf02d\n\uf06c \uf077 \uf07a\uf03d \uf02d\uf070 \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a ,               (3) \nand  \n2\n1, 0\n0, 0 2, 0\n( , )\n1\n( , ) ( , )\nU\nU\nU U\n\uf06c \uf077 \uf07a\uf064 \uf03d \uf02d \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a ,               (4) \nwhere sT  is the time observing window, and p  is the not-exceeding probability.

No rules \nhave been imposed regarding the duration, the input energy, the stationary or nonsta-\ntionary behaviour of the simulated time-histories. On the other hand, the importance of \nnon-stationary frequency content on the response of nonlinear structures has been mani-\nfested in various studies [21,22]. Thus, more reliable simulations have to take into ac-\ncount the time variability of the frequency content of the ground motion.  \n 9\nAccording to that, in this paper a new strategy for simulating spectrum compatible \nfully nonstationary earthquakes is proposed. To this aim, it is assumed that the nonsta-\ntionary spectrum compatible earthquake is modeled by the superposition of two contri-\nbutions: the first one is a fully-nonstationary known counterpart modeled by a recorded \nearthquake, that takes into account the time variability of both intensity and frequency \ncontent; the second one is a corrective term represented by a stationary zero-mean \nGaussian process adjusting the response spectrum of the nonstationary signal in order to \nmake it spectrum compatible. That is, \n( ) ( ) ( )R Sg g gu t u t u t\uf061\uf03d \uf02b\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026 ,              (13) \n \nwhere )(tu Rg\uf026\uf026  is the recorded (R) earthquake time history that is assumed known, \uf061 is a \nscaling coefficient  and ( )Sgu t\uf026\uf026  is the stochastic (S) corrective term whose power spectral \ndensity has to be determined. Accordingly, let consider the equation governing the mo-\ntion of a single-degree-of-freedom system \n2\n0 0( ) 2 ( ) ( ) ( ( ) ( ))\nR S\ng gu t u t u t u t u t\uf07a\uf077 \uf077 \uf061\uf02b \uf02b \uf03d \uf02d \uf02b\uf026\uf026 \uf026 \uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026 .

(17) \nAccordingly, the response spectrum 0( , )RSA \uf077 \uf07a  of the ground motion  ( )gu t\uf026\uf026  given in \neq.

The latter can be approximately determined through the \nfirst crossing problem given by the equation \n0\n2\n0 0 0 0 0 00, 0, 1, 2, 0,\n( , )\n( , 0.5, ( , ), ( , ), ( , ), ( , )) ( , )S S S S S S\nS\nsU U U U U U\nRSA\nT p\n\uf077 \uf07a\n\uf077 \uf068 \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a \uf06c \uf077 \uf07a\uf03d \uf03d\n              (19) \nformally analogous to eq.

However, in the case in which the response spectrum \nof the natural accelerograms lies very below the target response spectrum equation (22) \ncan be again retained for reducing the influence of the corrective term on the overall \nmodel. \nTherefore, modifying the solution proposed in [17] the power spectral density of the \ncorrective stochastic stationary process )(tu Sg\uf026\uf026  is given by \n\uf028 \uf029 0 0\ng\nS\nu lG \uf077 \uf03d \uf0a3 \uf077\uf0a3 \uf077\uf026\uf026 ,                 (23) \n 12\n2 2 2 1\n2\n11\n2 2 2 1\n2\n1\n( , ) ( , )4( ) ( )\n4 ( , )\n( , ) ( , ) ( ) ,\n( , )\ng g\nS\ng\nS\nR i\nS Si i\nu i u j\nji i iU\nR i\nSi i\nu j l\njiU\nRSA RSAG G\nRSA RSA G\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf077 \uf07a \uf02d\uf061 \uf077 \uf07a\uf07a\uf077 \uf03d \uf02d\uf044\uf077 \uf077\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf077 \uf070\uf02d \uf07a\uf077 \uf068 \uf077 \uf07a\uf0e8 \uf0f8\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf077 \uf07a \uf02d\uf061 \uf077 \uf07a\uf0b4 \uf02d\uf044\uf077 \uf077 \uf077 \uf03e \uf077\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf068 \uf077 \uf07a\uf0e8 \uf0f8\n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026\n\uf026\uf026\nU\n  (24) \nwith SU\uf068  approximately posed equal to U\uf068 defined in eq.

Depending on the rec-\norded earthquake time history iterative improvement of the power spectral density of the \ncorrective term could be necessary for satisfying code provisions.

The nonstationary be-\nhavior relies on the recorded signal that would be chosen so as to reflect local geotech-\n 13\nnical and seismological characteristics. The spectrum compatible criteria are satisfied by \nthe superposition of the corrective quasi-stationary Gaussian random process whose \npower spectral density have been determined through a handy recursive formula. \n \n4 INFLUENCE OF THE CORRECTIVE TERM \nIn previous sections it has been proposed an approach for generating fully nonstatio-\nnary spectrum compatible earthquakes. By the proposed approach recorded time-\nhistories are modified via a corrective term enhancing the frequency content of the orig-\ninal signal. In order to clarify how the corrective term modify the nonstationary content \nof the signal two parameters are scrutinized, namely the mean instantaneous energy and \nfrequency [29]. The term instantaneous implies that both energy and frequency are va-\nluated locally so as to describe their evolution in time. Specifically, it can be shown [30] \nthat the mean instantaneous energy ( )E t  can be determined directly by the knowledge \nof the evolutionary power spectral density function ( , )\ngu\nG t\uf077\uf026\uf026  of the ground motion \nprocess by the equation \n0,\n0\n( ) ( ) ( , )\ng gu u\nE t t G t d\n\uf0a5\n\uf03d \uf06c \uf03d \uf077 \uf077\uf0f2\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026                       (27) \nwhere the brackets stands for mean value. Taking into account eq (13) and owing to the \nstatistical independence of the random corrective term and the deterministic recorded \nearthquake, the following equation holds \n\u02c6( , ) ( , ) ( , )\ng g g\nR S\nu u uG t G t G t\uf077 \uf077 \uf077\uf03d \uf02b\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026 .

Furthermore, using equation (27) after simple algebra \nit can be shown that  \n( ) ( ) ( )R SE t E t E t\uf03d \uf02b                               (30) \nwhere ( )RE t  is the mean instantaneous energy of the recorded signal given by the \nequation \n0\n\u02c6( ) ( , )\ng\nR R\nuE t G t d\n\uf0a5\n\uf03d \uf077 \uf077\uf0f2 \uf026\uf026                               (31) \n \nwhile ( )SE t  is the mean instantaneous energy of the corrective term given by the \nequation  \n2\n0,\n0\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\ng g\nS S S\nu uE t t t G d\n\uf0a5\n\uf03d \uf06c \uf03d \uf06a \uf077 \uf077\uf0f2\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026  ,                     (32) \nEquation (30) emphasizes that the corrective term provides an increment of the origi-\nnal energy of the recorded signal, strictly related to the amplitude of the signal, measur-\nable by the knowledge of equation (32). \nIn order to scrutinize the variation of the frequency content with respect to time the \nmean instantaneous frequency is introduced [29, 33, 34], \n 15\n0\n0\n( , )\n( )\n( , )\ng\ng\nu\nu\nG t d\nt\nG t d\n\uf0a5\n\uf0a5\n\uf077 \uf077 \uf077\n\uf077 \uf03d\n\uf077 \uf077\n\uf0f2\n\uf0f2\n\uf026\uf026\n\uf026\uf026\n                           (33) \nBy using the same arguments to determine the mean instantaneous energy, after simple \nalgebra it can be shown that  \n( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) ( )\nR R S S\nR S\nt E t E t\nt\nE t E t\n\uf077 \uf02b \uf077\uf077 \uf03d \uf02b                       (34) \nwhere ( )R t\uf077  is the mean instantaneous frequency of the original record given by the \nequation \n0 0\n0 0\n\u02c6( , ) ( , )\n( )\n\u02c6( , ) ( , )\ng g\ng g\nR R\nu u\nR\nR R\nu u\nG t d G t d\nt\nG t d G t d\n\uf0a5 \uf0a5\n\uf0a5 \uf0a5\n\uf077 \uf077 \uf077 \uf077 \uf077 \uf077\n\uf077 \uf03d \uf0ba\n\uf077 \uf077 \uf077 \uf077\n\uf0f2 \uf0f2\n\uf0f2 \uf0f2\n\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026\n\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026\n                   (35) \n \nwhile S\uf077  is the mean instantaneous frequency of the quasi-stationary corrective term, \nclearly independent with respect to time.

Equation (34) \nshows that the nonstationary frequency content of the original record manifested \nthrough the evolution of the mean instantaneous frequency ( )R t\uf077 , is modified due the \nadding of the corrective term in a weighted mean sense. As a consequence the more the \n 16\nmean instantaneous energy content of the corrective term is negligible the more the lo-\ncal nonstationary behavior of the simulated spectrum compatible earthquakes tends to \nthat one pertaining to the original record. \n \n5 NUMERICAL RESULTS \nIn this section the proposed method for generating fully nonstationary spectrum compat-\nible earthquakes is applied to the target response spectrum defined in Eurocode 8 [2]. \nSpecifically, for a 5% damping ratio the response spectrum is given by the equations  \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 2\n1 1.5 0\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5 4\ng B\nB\ng B C\nC\ng C D\nC D\ng D\nTRSA T a S T T\nT\nRSA T a S T T T\nTRSA T a S T T T\nT\nT TRSA T a S T T s\nT\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf03d \uf02b \uf0a3 \uf0a3\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0eb \uf0fb\n\uf03d \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf03d \uf0a3 \uf0a3\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0eb \uf0fb\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf03d \uf0a3 \uf0a3\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0eb \uf0fb\n              (37) \n \nAccording to Eurocode 8, consistency (i.e. spectrum compatibility) is considered to be \nachieved if the condition \n\uf0b2 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029max 100 10%\nRSA T RSA T\nRSA T\n\uf0ec \uf0fc\uf02d\uf0ef \uf0ef\uf0b4 \uf0a3\uf0ed \uf0fd\uf0ef \uf0ef\uf0ee \uf0fe\n              (38) \nis satisfied over the range of periods between 10.2T  to 12T ; 1T  being the fundamental pe-\nriod of the structure under study in the direction where the accelerogram is applied;  and \nif \n 17\n\uf0b2 \uf028 \uf0290 gRSA a S\uf03e ,              (39) \n\uf0b2 \uf028 \uf029RSA T  being the mean response spectrum from at least three simulated earthquakes.  \n \n5.1 Example 1 \nIn this numerical example Type B soil (deposits of very dense sand, gravel, or very stiff \nclayground) and Type 1 seismicity has been selected.

The first record corresponds to the SOOE (N-S) component of \nthe Imperial Valley earthquake of May 18, 1940, recorded at El Centro site. The second \nrecord is the NOOW (N-S) component of the san Fernando earthquake of February 9, \n1971, recorded at Orion Boulevard site, extensively studied in reference [31]. \n \n5.1.1 EL CENTRO 1940, NORTH-SOUTH COMPONENT \n \nEl Centro (1940) earthquake is used first. Pertinent ground motion time history is plot-\nted in Figure 1a. In order to apply the proposed procedure the duration of the time ob-\nserving window sT  has to be set along with the parameters of the modulating function \ndefined in equation (12). These parameters can be determined through the so called Hu-\nsid function [36] defined by the equation \n 18\n2\n0\n2\n0\n( )\n( ) ; 0 ( ) 1\n( )\nf\nt\nR\ng\nt\nR\ng\nu t dt\nt t\nu t dt\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf0eb \uf0fb\n\uf03d \uf0a3 \uf0a3\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf0eb \uf0fb\n\uf0f2\n\uf0f2\n\uf026\uf026\n\uf026\uf026\nH H ,              (40) \n30ft s\uf03d  being the duration of the recorded earthquake ground motion. Accordingly, \nthe duration of the strong motion phase, that will be assumed coincident to duration of \nthe time-observing window, is 2 1sT t t\uf03d \uf02d , where 1t  and 2t  are the time instants in which \n( )tH  is equal to 0.05 and 0.95, respectively. Figure 1b shows the evolution of the Hu-\nsid function. Pertinent parameters are: 1 1.65t s\uf03d , 2 25.51t s\uf03d  and 23.86ssT \uf03d . Fur-\nthermore the parameter \uf062  defining the decay of the modulating function after 2t  has \nbeen set equal to 23 \/( )ft t\uf02d  so reducing the amplitude of the simulated signal of about \n95% for ft t\uf03d . Since the response spectrum of the recorded earthquake lies below the \ntarget one no scaling coefficient have been used for this example (i.e. 1\uf061 \uf03d ). \nThe stationary power spectral density function of the corrective stochastic process has \nbeen then determined via the proposed procedure and depicted in Figure 2. Just five ite-\nrations has been required for satisfying equation (38).  One hundred spectrum compati-\nble artificial earthquakes have been simulated by using equation (25) setting 400aN \uf03d  \nand 0.25 \/rad s\uf077\uf044 \uf03d  .  Three trajectories are plotted in Figure 3 manifesting the ran-\ndomness of the simulated accelerograms.  \nIt is noted that the simulation of artificial accelerograms could lead to velocity and dis-\nplacement trajectories possessing unrealistic drift. This phenomenon, widely addressed \nin literature for real earthquakes [36], have been also manifested in previous studies on \nthe simulated accelerograms (see e.g.[14],[27]). It has to be emphasized that the correc-\n 19\ntion of this physically unrealistic drift is crucial for the analysis of nonlinear behaving \nstructures as well as linear behaving structures with very long period [14, 27]. To date \nthere is no unique criterion for correcting the artificial accelerograms. A comparative \nstudy of many common techniques applied for correcting real earthquakes have been \npresented in [36].  Herein, a modified version of the second order polynomial baseline \ncorrection presented in [14] has been applied in this paper. Specifically, each individual \nsimulated trajectory ( ) ( )kgu t\uf026\uf026  is modified as follows  \n( ) ( ) 2\n0 1 2\u02c6 ( ) ( ) ( )\nk k\ng gu t u t a a t a t\uf03d \uf02d \uf02b \uf02b\uf026\uf026 \uf026\uf026                       (41) \nwhere the coefficients 0a , 1a , and 2a  of the polynomial have been herein determined \napproximating ( ) ( )kgu t\uf026\uf026  in a least square sense. It is noted that this approach can be re-\ngarded as an application of a low band filter to the simulated trajectory ( ) ( )kgu t\uf026\uf026 . Figure 4 \nshows the physical reliable behavior of both velocity and displacement trajectories \ncomputed from a selected corrected accelerograms.  \nIn order to check the suitability of the simulated artificial earthquakes according to \nEC8 provisions in Figure 5 the mean response spectrum is compared with the target re-\nsponse spectrum. The perfect matching manifests the accuracy of the proposed proce-\ndure and the suitability of the generated artificial accelerograms for design purposes.   \nFor sake of clarity Figure 6 shows the flow chart of the procedure proposed for simulat-\ning the spectrum compatible accelerograms. \nThe nonstationary features of the artificial spectrum compatible earthquakes have been \nthen scrutinized through the study of the joint time frequency power spectral density \nfunction. According to equation (28) the joint time-frequency power spectral density \nfunction is given by the superposition of two contributions. The first one is given by the \n 20\njoint-time frequency distribution of the nonstationary natural accelerogram while the \nsecond one is given by the separable power spectrum of the random corrective term. \nThe former contribution can be determined through various approaches (Short Time \nFourier Transform, Wavelets Transform, etc.).  A comprehensive study on the current \nprocedures can be found in [29, 32, 33]. The analytical model proposed for the El Cen-\ntro 1940 earthquake proposed by Conte and Peng [31] is used in this paper and depicted \nin Figure 7a. Figure 7b shows the separable power spectral density function of the cor-\nrective term determined through equations (12), (23), (24) and (29) while, in Figure 7c \nthe spectrum compatible evolutionary power spectral density function of the artificial \nground motion acceleration determined by the proposed approach through equation (28) \nis depicted. Furthermore, the mean instantaneous energy (Figure 8) and frequency (Fig-\nure 9) have been evaluated by using equations (30) and (34). Remarkably, the time va-\nriability of both these quantities manifests the fully nonstationary behavior of the spec-\ntrum compatible artificial accelerograms preserving also similar shape (distribution of \npeaks and valleys) of that determined for the original earthquake record. \n \n \n5.1.2 ORION BOULEVARD 1971, NORTH-SOUTH COMPONENT \n \nThe proposed procedure for simulating fully nonstationary spectrum compatible earth-\nquakes has been also applied to the Orion Boulevard 1971 earthquake record. Ground \nmotion acceleration time history along with Husid function is depicted in Figures 10. \nPertinent estimated parameters are: 1 3.94t s\uf03d , 2 18.88 t s\uf03d  and 14.94ssT \uf03d . The sta-\ntionary power spectral density function of the corrective stochastic process has been \n 21\nthen determined and depicted in Figure 11. Also in this case one hundred samples of the \nspectrum compatible artificial earthquakes have been simulated. Three of these trajecto-\nries are plotted in Figure 12. Evidence of the effectiveness of the baseline correction \nadopted can be found in Figure 13. The mean response spectrum has been then com-\npared with the target response spectrum in order to check the suitability of the simulated \nartificial earthquakes according to EC8 provisions. Remarkably, the perfect matching \nshowed in Figure 14 manifests the efficiency of the proposed procedure and the suitabil-\nity of this second set of artificial accelerograms for design purposes.  \nTime variability of the spectral content of both original and modified spectrum compat-\nible earthquakes is shown in Figures 15. Due the strong nonstationary characteristics of \nthe Orion Boulevard 1971 ground acceleration record the influence of the corrective \nterm is herein more evident. Nevertheless, the spectrum compatible artificial earth-\nquakes still preserve fully nonstationary characteristics as shown in Figures 16 and 17. \n \n \n5.2 Example 2 \nThe two numerical examples shown in previous section posses the common characte-\nristic that the response spectrum of the recorded accelerograms lies below the target re-\nsponse spectrum. Since the response spectra of both the accelerograms are very close to \nthe target one at some frequencies, no scaling parameter has been used (i.e. 1\uf061 \uf03d ). In \nthis numerical example the case in which the response spectral coordinates of the origi-\nnal recorded accelerogram attain higher values from the target spectrum at some fre-\nquencies\/natural periods (for which the scaling parameter 1\uf061 \uf03c  is required) and the \ncase where the response spectral coordinates of the original recorded accelerogram lies \n 22\nvery below the target spectrum is addressed. Type A (Rock or other rock-like geological \nformation, including at most 5 m of weaker material at the surface.), and Type D (De-\nposits of loose-to-medium cohesionless soil, or of predominantly soft-to-firm cohesive \nsoil) have been selected for this purpose. El Centro 1940 ground acceleration record has \nbeen also selected. For both cases the parameter \uf061 has been determined through equa-\ntion (22) obtaining 0.44\uf061 \uf03d  and 1.16\uf061 \uf03d  for Type A and Type D response spectrum \ncases, respectively. Clearly, the value 0.44\uf061 \uf03d , manifests that the response spectrum of \nEl Centro 1940 earthquake attains values higher about twice the value the target re-\nsponse spectrum for a given natural frequency. After scaling the recorded accelerograms \nthe procedure is applied. Figure 18 shows the accuracy of the proposed approach also in \nthese cases. The joint time-frequency distribution of the El Centro 1940 earthquake is \nshown in Figures 19 and 20 pertaining Type A and Type D response spectra, respective-\nly. By the comparison of Figures 19(a) and 19(b) it is observed that the corrective term \nrepresents the major contribution to the whole spectrum compatible power spectral den-\nsity function. By the exam of Figures 20(a) and 20(b), on the other hand, the contribu-\ntion of the corrective term appears comparable with the scaling joint time frequency dis-\ntribution of the El Centro 1940 earthquake. This is clearly related to the different target \nresponse spectra considered. Furthermore, by the exam of Figures (19) and (20) it can \nbe appreciated as the corrective term modifies the original time variability of both mean \ninstantaneous energy and frequency. Specifically, the greater is the energy content of \nthe quasi stationary corrective term, such as in the case response spectrum A, the greater \nis the difference between the original and the modified mean instantaneous energy and \nfrequency functions. \n \n 23\n6 CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper a method for generating fully nonstationary spectrum compatible earth-\nquakes has been proposed. The method is based on the spectral representation of sto-\nchastic processes. Specifically, it is assumed that the ground motion is modeled by the \nsuperposition of two contribution: the first one is a fully-nonstationary counterpart \nmodeled by a recorded earthquake that takes into account the time variability of both in-\ntensity and frequency content; the second one is a corrective term represented by a sta-\ntionary process adjusting the response spectrum of the nonstationary signal in order to \nmake it spectrum compatible. The corrective term is determined using a handy recursive \nformula determining the pertinent power spectral density function. The method is quite \nversatile and it has provided accurate results in all the cases analyzed.  \nRemarkably, the simulated earthquakes do not require any further iterative correction \nleading the proposed procedure very handy and competitive from a computational point \nof view. Moreover the method allows to determine the evolutionary spectrum compati-\nble power spectral density that can be used for reliability studies.  \nThe influence of the corrective term on the nonstationary characteristics of the origi-\nnal record has been studied by the mean of both instantaneous energy and frequency \ntime evolution. Interestingly, two sets of artificial earthquakes possessing quite different \nnonstationary characteristics and fulfilling Eurocode 8 provisions have been determined. \nAccordingly, both sets can be used for design purpose. Future works will be aimed to \nstudy the influence of this multiple solutions on the seismic assessment of structures.  \n \n \n \n 24\nREFERENCES \n \n[1] International Conference of Building Officials, Uniform Building Code, Vol. 2, \n1997. \n[2] European Committee for Standardization, Eurocode 8: Design of structures for \nearthquake resistance -Part 1: General rules, seismic actions and rules for build-\nings\u00b8 Brussels, Belgium 2003. \n[3] Ahmadi G.
