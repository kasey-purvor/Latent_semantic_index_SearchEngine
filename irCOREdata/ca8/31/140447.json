Introduction \nThe United Kingdom (UK) is subject to a legally binding European target to \nobtain 15% of its energy requirements (heat, electricity and transport) from \nrenewable technologies by 2020 (BWEA, 2008a; DECC, 2009c). \nFurthermore the Climate Change Act (HM Parliament, 2008a) imposes a \nlegally binding target, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 20% of 1990 \nlevels by 2050. The generation of electricity from renewable sources is being \n 3 \nseen as fundamental to achieving these targets (DECC, 2009c; Venables, \n2008). \nClimate change is one of three key drivers for renewable electricity \ngeneration; the others are security of supply and affordability (Fig. 1.) (DTI, \n2007; Sellick, 2008). Additional pressure comes from the age of the existing \nfossil and nuclear electricity generating fleet, which needs to be replaced \nwithin 50 years (Clarke, 8th June 2009). Furthermore the UK\u2019s energy needs \nare forecast to grow, requiring an additional 30-35GW of new capacity by \n2030 (DTI, 2007). \n \nFig. 1.  The drivers for renewal energy (adapted from (DTI, 2007; Sellick, 2008)) \nThe UK has some of the best offshore wind resources in the world \n(Sustainable Development Commission, 2005), and offshore wind farms are \nbeing heralded as major contributors to the UK\u2019s electricity generation mix \nafter 2010 (BWEA, 2008a; DECC, 24\/6\/09). Wind turbine technology is a \nproven technology and has been applied offshore with some success. \nFollowing two rounds of licensing in 2000 and 2003, the UK has the largest \nClimate \nChange \nSecurity of supply \no \n \n  \nof supply \nAffordability \n 4 \nfleet of operational wind farms in the world (BVG Associates, 2009), with a \ngenerating capacity of almost 600MW (BWEA, 2008b).  \nRound 1 and 2 development, however, has not proceeded at the rate initially \nenvisaged; this required some 4.5-5.5GW of operating capacity by 2010 \n(Burke, 2004; DTI, 2002). If the UK is to achieve its 2020 target, a step \nchange in the rate of development is needed. The challenges facing \ndevelopment are complex, but fall broadly into five categories: project \neconomics, technical constraints, supply chain capacity, social effects, \nnamely to amenity and aesthetics, and environmental impacts (Sustainable \nDevelopment Commission, 2005; Haggett, 2008). The legal framework for \noffshore wind farm development consent must address all these aspects.  \nThe third round of offshore wind farm leasing was announced by The Crown \nEstate on 4th June 2008, with a target of a further 25GW of installed \ngenerating capacity by 2020 (The Crown Estate, 2008b). On the 24th June \n2009, following consultation on the Strategic Environmental Assessment \n(SEA) for UK Offshore Energy (DECC, 2009b) the UK government gave the \ngo ahead to proceed with this third round in England and Wales (DECC, \n24\/6\/09; Lord Hunt of Kings Heath OBE, Jun 2009), with a view to granting \nleases by the end of 2009 (The Crown Estate, 2009). These ambitious plans \nrepresent a \u00a3100bn challenge and opportunity (Clarke, 8th June 2009) for \nthe UK economy, and a potential 70,000 jobs in a new industry (DECC, \n24\/6\/09; Carbon Trust, 2008). \nRound 3 wind farms will be subject to a different consenting process from the \nearlier rounds. The Planning Act 2008 (HM Parliament, 2008b) and the \n 5 \nMarine and Coastal Access Bill (DEFRA, 2008b) will provide a new legal \nframework for the consents process. \nThis paper will present the findings of a research project looking at the \ndevelopment of the offshore wind industry in England. The research focus \nwas the legal framework for consents for offshore wind farms, and its \nimplications for the rate of development, to date and into the future. The aim \nwas to answer the question: \nIs the legal framework for consents helping or hindering offshore wind \nfarm development, and achievement of the targets for renewable \nenergy generation? \nThe approach adopted was to: \n explore the experience to date of the licensing and consenting \nprocess for offshore wind farms in Rounds 1 and 2;  \n gain an understanding of and explain the future consents process for \nRound 3;  \n identify, categorise and consult stakeholders in the process, and \nanalyse their perceptions of the consents process; \n assess whether the new process will successfully address shortfalls in \nthe earlier process.  \nDue to differing legal regimes in the devolved assemblies in the UK, the \nproject focussed on offshore wind farm development in England. \n 6 \nThe research methodology is described in the next section. Our findings are \nset out in the following section, which presents the time frame for offshore \nwind projects and the results of stakeholder analysis for the consents \nprocess. An analysis of the legal framework for future consents, including \nprocess diagrams for the current and future consenting processes, follows, \nand then the results of a survey of stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of the consents \nprocess are described. The findings are discussed in the subsequent section \nbefore conclusions are drawn and further work recommended. \n2. Methodology \nInternet research sought to construct a time frame for the consents process \nfor Round 1 and 2 projects including forecast completion date for incomplete \nprojects. Primary data sources consulted included the websites for wind farm \ndevelopers and news archives. Whilst this approach the gave increased \nunderstanding of the extent of offshore wind farm development in England \nand Wales, due to time limitations and lack of data in the public domain, it \nwas only possible to construct a typical timeline, rather than detailed time \nlines for each project. \nRound 3 wind farm projects will be subject to a different legal regime to \nrounds 1 and 2. To gain a full understanding of the new consents regime, an \nanalysis of the Planning Act 2008, and the Marine and Coastal Access Bill \nwas undertaken. Drawing on the Government\u2019s own guidance that \nregulations should be written so that they are easily understood, \nimplemented and enforced; that regulators should be accountable for the \n 7 \nefficiency and effectiveness of their activities; and that regulatory activity \nshould allow, or even encourage, economic development (Hampton, 2005), \nThis analysis sought to identify whether the new legal framework addresses \nthe shortfalls in the previous consenting process identified by stakeholders in \ninterview. \nStakeholder organisations were identified through the literature review and \ninternet research. These were recorded in a stakeholder analysis tool \ndeveloped for the UK Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme \n(Graves and Morris, 2007). Using an \u201canalytical categorisation\u201d approach \n(Reed et al., 2009), stakeholders were ranked by consideration of the \nquestion:  \n\"Which individuals and organisations (i.e. stakeholders) have \"Interest \nin\" and \"Influence over\" over the leasing and consents process for \noffshore wind farms?\u201d  \nRankings were made in accordance with the criteria defined by (Graves and \nMorris, 2009). Through this process it was possible to identify the \u201ckey \nplayers\u201d and \u201ccontext setters\u201d in the consents process in addition to the \n\u201csubjects\u201d and \u201ccrowd\u201d (Reed et al., 2009). This approach facilitated the \nidentification of organisations for subsequent interview, with the intention that \neach of these groups be represented. \nTo gain an understanding of perceptions of the consents process across the \nindustry, a series of telephone interviews was conducted. The questionnaire \ncomprised three sections. The first section comprised closed and open \n 8 \nquestions to confirm the respondent organisation\u2019s interest in and influence \nover the consents process, and hence their position on the stakeholder \nanalysis plot. The second section comprised open questions to investigate \nthe respondent organisation\u2019s experience of the consents process during \nround 1 and 2. The open questions gave respondents freedom to answer in \ntheir own words and flexibility to speak about issues of specific concern to \ntheir organisation, which may not be relevant to all stakeholders (Gill and \nJohnson, 2002). Further open questions in the third section sought to \nunderstand the perceptions of the new process for round 3, both in terms of \nimprovements and limitations. \nInterviews were conducted by telephone rather than face to face, to reduce \ntravel costs and time demand (Robson, 2002). Organisations were selected \nto be representative of a cross section of stakeholders at various interest and \ninfluence levels, from each of the groups of \u201ckey players, context setters, \nsubjects and crowd\u201d (Reed et al., 2009; Graves and Morris, 2009). An initial \nemail introduced the survey and expectations, and requested to arrange a \ntelephone interview with the relevant representative of the stakeholder \norganisation. Due to potential commercial sensitivities, the initial email \nincluded assurance that respondents might remain anonymous in the final \nthesis documents (Gill and Johnson, 2002). \nTelephone interviews were conducted with organisations responding \npositively to the request, and followed the questionnaire. Where interesting \nthemes were identified, these were explored more deeply using structured \ninterview techniques (Robson, 2002). Whilst telephone interviews allowed \n 9 \ndata to be collected from a range of geographically dispersed stakeholders, \nat relatively low cost, the disadvantages of this method of data collection are \nthat it is more difficult to build rapport, and there may be problems with \ninterpretation when compared to face to face interviews (Robson, 2002).  \nData collection took place from late June to mid August 2009. Following the \ngo-ahead to Round 3 on 24th June, this was a busy time in the offshore wind \nindustry, as well as being a holiday period. This may account for some of the \ndifficulties experienced in arranging telephone interviews with stakeholder \norganisations. As a back-up to telephone interviews, an online version of the \nquestionnaire was developed. This was offered as an alternative to \ntelephone interviews towards the end of the data collection period. The \nonline questionnaire provided a means to obtain data from a broader range \nof stakeholders; however this data was more limited than that provided from \ntelephone interviews, due to the lack of personal interaction and involvement \n(Robson, 2002).  \nThe bulk of the data collected was qualitative data, which was subject to \nanalysis by the following steps (Robson, 2002; Miles and Huberman, 1994):  \n transcribing of interview; \n summarising of contact; \n coding interview responses; \n analysis of responses. \nFollow up emails were sent to a selection of stakeholders to validate theories \ndeveloped from the survey findings. \n 10 \n3. Findings \nTime frame for offshore wind farm development \nInternet research provided data to compile the projected growth in offshore \nwind generating capacity from rounds 1 and 2 wind farms, against \nGovernment targets (Fig. 2.);  \n \nFig. 2.  Projected growth of offshore wind energy capacity of the UK from \nRound 1 and 2 projects (as envisaged at August 2009). Compiled from \nproject completion dates established through internet research.  \nThis confirms the expectations of the industry (BWEA and Garrad Hassan, \n2009b). The rate of offshore wind farm construction will increase significantly \nover the next five years, with the final capacity from Round 2 coming on line \nby 2015. The total capacity at this time is forecast to be of the order of 8GW. \n 11 \nUsing the same data, a summary time line for Round 2 wind farms has been \ncompiled (Fig. 3.).  \n \nFig. 3.  Summary of timeline for Round 2 offshore wind projects \nOur observations from the timeline for Round 2 projects are: \n it took approximately two years to submit the earliest consent \napplications; \n consent applications and environmental statements (ES) are still to be \nsubmitted for a small number of  projects, with the last forecast to be \nsubmitted in 2010; \n the earliest consent was granted in 2006, and  it has taken around two \nyears to grant consent; on this basis, consent for the final wind farm \nmay not be granted until 2012; \n construction starts approximately two years after gaining consent, and \nconstruction may take a further two years to complete.  \nDec 2003 \nAgreement \nfor lease \n2006 -2012 \nConsents \ngranted \n2008 \u2013 2014 \nStart \nconstruction \n2010 \u2013 2015 \nFinish \nconstruction \n2015 \nRound 2 \ndelivered \n2005 - 2010 \nSubmission of \nenvironmental \nstatements \n 12 \nBy comparison Round 1 wind farms, considered as demonstration projects, \nexperienced a faster consenting process and much shorter overall project \nduration (BWEA, 2008a). \nAnalysis of the legal framework for the consents process \nThe consents process for Round 1 and 2 offshore wind farms has been \ndescribed in detail by Dower et al., 2002; Gray et al., 2005; Pettersson, 2008; \nScott, 2006; Trinick, 2006 and others. There are two possible consenting \nroutes: section 36 of the Electricity Act (HM Parliament, 1989) or section 3 of \nthe Transport and Works Act (HM Parliament, 1992). The majority of Round \n1 and 2 consent applications have been made under the section 36 route, \nsince the amendment of the Electricity Act, by the Energy Act (HM \nParliament, 2004), to allow for the creation of exclusion zones around \noffshore wind farm installations.  \nA process diagram of the section 36 consents process has been derived and \nis presented in Fig. 4.This clearly shows the complexity of the current \nprocess. Offshore wind farms require some six separate consents, \ndepending on the extent of the development, which are considered by four \ndifferent consenting bodies. There is potential that the different consenting \nbodies will reach different decisions on whether to grant consent, and the \ntimescales are inconsistent (DEFRA, 2008a). Although there is an intention \nto bring the consideration of consents for offshore works together at a \nnational government level (Pettersson, 2008), the onshore works fall within \nthe jurisdiction of local planning authorities. This can result in delays to \n 13 \nprojects, when local authorities decline planning permission, which may then \nbecome subject to public enquiry (Jay, 2008). \nRound 3 projects will be subject to a different consenting regime to their \npredecessors. The Planning Act (HM Parliament, 2008b) and the Marine and \nCoastal Access Bill (DEFRA, 2008b), currently under consideration by \nParliament, provide a new legislative framework for the consents process. \nThe generating capacity of the wind farm determines which legislation is \napplicable to a given consent application. Developments with a capacity \ngreater than 100MW will be subject to consideration and decision by the \nInfrastructure Planning Commission under the Planning Act 2008, whilst \nsmaller projects will be determined by the Marine Management Organisation \nunder the Marine and Coastal Access Bill. The introduction of different \nconsenting regimes, with different decision making bodies,  for developments \nof different sizes decreases consistency, integrity and uniformity, and  \nbreaches the best practice requirements for permitting regimes as set out by \n(DEFRA, 2009).  \n 14 \n \nFig. 4.

The Act seeks to improve the \nconsenting process by reducing the number of consents required and \nelevating planning decision-making from local level to national level, and \nhence reduce time and costs associated with obtaining development \nconsent (Pitt, 2009). Under section 15(3) of the new Planning Act, large \noffshore wind farms, with capacity greater than 100MW, will be considered \nNationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP). The majority of Round \n3 projects will have capacity greater than 100MW (Wilson and Triggs, \n2008), so will require development consent under this Act. This cut-off \nfigure of 100MW appears somewhat arbitrary; with current technology this \ncould be achieved with as few as 30 turbines. \nPart 1 of the Act establishes a new body, the Infrastructure Planning \nCommission (IPC), with responsibility for making planning decisions for \nNSIP. The IPC will be independent of government and able to make \n\u201ctransparent, expert, accountable and ethical decisions\u201d (Pitt, 2009). The \nIPC will be guided by National Policy Statements (NPS) (HM Parliament, \n2008b) part 2), which set the policy framework for planning decisions in \nspecified fields of development, namely: energy, transport, water, waste \nwater and waste (section 14(6)). NPSs will be prepared by the Secretary \n 16 \nof State with responsibility for the field of development, and must take into \nconsideration the requirement to achieve sustainable development.  \nIn defining the NPS, there is a duty on the Secretary of State to carry out \nappropriate consultation and publicity (section 7). In defining the \nconsultation requirements, the Secretary of State must consult with local \nauthorities affected by the NPS (section 8).  With respect to offshore wind \nfarm development, however, it is unclear which local authorities will be \nconsulted. The Act refers to local authorities where development is to be \nmade, and those neighbouring them, however local authority jurisdiction \ndoes not extend offshore (Jay, 2008). There is potential that all local \nauthorities along the coast could be affected by offshore wind farm \ndevelopments, which represents a vast constituency for consultation in \npreparing the NPS. Local authorities representing ports or industrial areas \nare liable to be supportive of offshore wind where they benefit the local \neconomy. By contrast, those in areas dependent on tourism may be \nconcerned about negative effects on the local economy. These conflicts \nwill need to be managed within a context of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment, as defined in section 10 of the Act, namely the mitigation of \nclimate change and the achievement of good design. The need to mitigate \nclimate change implies a predisposition to decisions in favour of offshore \nwind. \n 17 \nA process diagram of the future consents process for offshore wind farms \nhas been derived (Fig. 5). The significant differences compared to the \nprocess for Rounds 1 and 2 are: \n zonal development agreements (ZDA) between The Crown Estate \nand developers, with the Crown Estate acting in partnership with \ndevelopers in obtaining development consent (The Crown Estate, \n2008a); \n formal acceptance of the consent application by the IPC only after \ncompletion of all statutory consultations and provision of all required \ndocuments (part 5 chapter 2); \n development consent replaces requirement to obtain consents \nunder s.36 and s.37 of the Electricity Act 1989, and planning \npermission (section 33 (1a,  h)); \n defined timescales of 6 months for examination of the application \n(section 98) and 3 months for decision on the application (section \n107). \n 18 \n \nFig. 5.

The process seems easier for \nstakeholders to understand, and to be integrated; it is more linear with \nfewer stages and fewer actors. There are, however, a number of concerns \nabout its detailed application, particularly with respect to the time frames \nfor the various stages of the process.  \nThe emphasis is on the developer, in partnership with The Crown Estate, \nto complete the pre-application process including full consultation and \nenvironmental assessment, before the application for development will be \naccepted for consideration by the IPC. Section 42 imposes a duty to \nconsult local authorities about proposed developments, and developers \nare also required to consult with local authorities with respect to how they \nplan to consult local communities (section 47). There is no definition of \nconsultation (UKELA, 2009), which may lead to different approaches by \ndifferent developers, and subsequently challenges to the process. It is to \nbe hoped that the involvement of the Crown Estate will provide some \nconsistency of approach.  \nAs with consultation for the NPS, the extent of involvement of local \nauthorities in the pre-application phase is unclear. Again the Act refers to \nlocal authorities where development is to be made, and those \nneighbouring them. The same conflicts with regards to industrial and \ntourist economies apply. Furthermore, the visual impact of the large wind \nfarms planned for Round 3 may affect a number of different local \n 20 \nauthorities along a coastline, presenting potential for considerable local \npolitical conflict, and challenge to the process. The visual impact of \noffshore wind farms on coastal communities is a complicated issue and \nwidely discussed in the literature (Haggett, 2008; Jay, 2008; Ladenburg \nand Dubgaard, 2007; Ladenburg, 2008; Ladenburg and Dubgaard, 2009; \nLadenburg, 2009b; Ladenburg, 2009a; Santora et al., 2004)  \nTimescales for publicising and consulting on the development proposal \nare also unclear (section 48). Section 45 specifies a minimum time frame \nfor consultation with local authorities of 28 days, but no maximum time \nframe. Section 47 similarly specifies 28 days consultation with local \nauthorities on how they intend to consult local people, but is silent on the \ntime frame for public consultation. Furthermore section 48 is silent on the \ntime frame for publicity. This opens a further possibility for legal challenge \nto the process. \nWhilst there is an objective for the IPC to decide development consent \napplications within a 9 month time frame (sections 98 and 107), there is \nsubstantial flexibility to extend this. Section 55 allows the IPC 28 days to \ndecide whether to accept an application. Thereafter, section 88 allows for \nan initial assessment meeting, with no real time limitations, which sets the \nstart date for the 6 month examination phase. There is potential for this \nmeeting to extend over more than one day, in which case it is the last day \nthat sets the start date. Both consideration and decision phases may be \nextended by the appropriate authority under sections 98(4) and 107(3) \n 21 \nrespectively. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce further uncertainty into the time \nframes for the consents process, by allowing for suspension of the \nprocess and intervention by the Secretary of State. These provisions \nreduce the potential for the IPC to be accountable for ensuring that its \nactivities are effective and efficient, as required by the government\u2019s own \nguidance on better regulation (Hampton, 2005).  \nIn parallel to the application for consent to the IPC, the developer may also \nbe required to apply to the MMO for a Marine Bill License for wind farms of \ncapacity greater than 100MW, although this may be deemed under the \nPlanning Act development consent. The Marine Bill will be considered \nfurther in the following section. \nThe Marine and Coastal Access Bill \nConsent applications for Round 3 offshore wind farms with capacity less \nthan 100MW will be subject to the provisions of the Marine and Coastal \nAccess Bill (DEFRA, 2008b). The Bill introduces similar reforms to marine \nplanning as the new Planning Act does to land based planning (Wilson \nand Triggs, 2008). It seeks to address the increasing anthropogenic \ndemands on marine resources, including navigation, oil and gas, dredging \nfor aggregates and fisheries, as well as offshore renewable energy and \nMarine Conservation Zones. \nPart 1, Chapter 1 of the Bill proposes the establishment of a new \norganisation, the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), with \n 22 \nresponsibility for managing the marine environment around England. The \nMMO would also be responsible for the entire UK offshore area, for those \nfunctions not devolved to the National Assemblies. These responsibilities \nwill include research, regulation, planning, harbour construction and \nalteration consents, and Marine Act licensing. In creating this new body, \nthe Bill goes against the recommendation of the Hampton Review that \nactivities be undertaken by existing organisations where possible \n(Hampton, 2005).  \nPart 4 of the bill seeks to simplify the license regime by consolidating two \nof the six consents currently required, those under Food and Environment \nProtection Act (FEPA) section 5 (HM Parliament, 1985) and Coast \nProtection Act (CPA) section 34 (HM Parliament, 1949), into one Marine \nAct license. For offshore renewable energy installations, Part 1 Chapter 2 \nof the Bill transfers Electricity Act section 36 licensing to the MMO so it can \ngrant all necessary consents for small offshore energy projects (less \nthan100MW). The transfer of Electricity Act consenting to a body with no \ndirect responsibility for electricity generation appears flawed, even if only \nfor small scale projects. There appears to be a conflict of interest between \nthe MMO\u2019s role in managing the marine environment overall and this \ninvolvement in consenting.  \nOne of the significant changes to be brought in with the bill will be the \nintroduction of marine planning (part 3). Long term objectives will be \noutlined in a Marine Policy Statement (MPS), on which the MMO will base \n 23 \nits decisions, much as the IPC will base its decisions on NPS.  The MPS \nwill provide a framework for regional marine plans (section 49), which will \ncontain the policies for sustainable development within the area to which \nthey apply. The MPS will consider all aspects of the marine environment \nand its use, and will need to be consistent with the NPS. \nIt is intended, that the IPC and MMO will work closely on all offshore \nrenewable energy projects (DEFRA, 2008a). Under section 23 of the Bill \nthe MMO is made a statutory consultee for all IPC development consents \nand the MMO will be responsible for enforcement of development \nconsents approved by the IPC. This implies a significant role for the MMO, \nwhich will need to be structured to support this. \nStakeholder Analysis \nForty different organisations or groupings of organisations, having a stake \nin the offshore wind farm consents process, were identified from the \nreview of the literature and internet research. These were ranked for \ninterest in and influence over the process. The results of this initial ranking \nare shown in Fig. 6, which divides the stakeholders into the different \nstakeholder groups: key players, context setters, subjects and crowd. \nStakeholders are further categorised by the nature of their activity: \ngovernment, industry, NGO, local interest and other user.  \nKey players are the major actors in the offshore wind farm consenting \nhence determining the success of the process (Graves and Morris, 2009). \n 24 \nThe key players were identified to be regulators or consenting authorities \n(government), developers (industry) and statutory environmental \nconsultees (NGOs). \nContext setters have a low level of interest on offshore wind farm \ndevelopment, but represent a significant risk to the process where they are \nin disagreement with the objective, as they have high level of influence \n(Reed et al., 2009). They include aviation interests (other users), other \ngovernment bodies, and the transmission and distribution network \noperator (industry).  \nSubjects have a high level of interest in the consents process, but have \nlittle influence over it (Reed et al., 2009; Graves and Morris, 2009). They \nmay be either supportive or unsupportive to the process. Supporters \ninclude consultants to developers for the consents process and trade  \n \n 25 \n \nFig 6:  Plot of stakeholder interest in and influence over the consents process for offshore wind farms, with stakeholders \ncategorised by role, and stakeholder group \nBIS\nBWEA\nRSPB\nCAA\nCommercial fisheries\nDCLG\nDECC\nConsultants - consents\nDEFRA\nDfT\nDevelopers\nEnvironment Agency\nEWEA\nMFA\nCivil contractors\nIMO\nJNCCLeisure sailors\nLDAs\nLocal businesses\nLocal Fishermen\nLocal planning authority\nLocal population\nSupport vessels\nComponent suppliers\nPorts\nConsultants - technical\nMoD\nLocal protest groups\nNFFO\nNational Grid\nNatural England\nOFGEM\nParish council\nShipping Lines\nJacking vessels\nThe Carbon Trust\nThe Crown Estate\nO&M contractors\nTurbine manufacturers\nInfluence\nIn\nte\nre\ns\nt\n \n \n \nContext setters \nCrowd \nSubjects \nKey players \n Industry  Local interest  Government       Other User  NGO \n 26 \n organisations (industry), local development agencies (LDAs) and ports \n(local interest).

A comparison of the initial \nassessment and with the stakeholders self assessment is given in Table 1. \nThe rankings from the original assessment were largely confirmed except \nfor the following significant movements: \n developers move from being key players to subjects; \n local planning authorities move from key players to crowd;  \n ports move from subjects to crowd. \n \n 27 \nTable 1: Comparison of stakeholder groups between initial assessment and stakeholder self assessment of interest in and \n influence over the consents process for offshore wind farms, with analysis of survey respondents by stakeholder group \n \nKey players Context setters Subjects Crowd\nInitial assessment DECC\nMFA\nDevelopers\nLocal planning authority\nDEFRA\nThe Crown Estate\nEnvironment Agency\nBIS\nJNCC\nNatural England\nOFGEM\nDfT\nDCLG\nCAA\nNational Grid\nMoD\nBWEA\nEWEA\nConsultants (consents)\nThe Carbon Trust\nPorts\nLocal fishermen\nLeisure sailors\nParish council \nLocal population\nLDAs\nO&M contractors\nLocal businesses\nLocal protest groups\nJacking vessels\nNFFO\nCivil contractors\nConsultants (technical)\nCommercial fisheries\nComponent suppliers\nShipping lines\nSupport vessels\nIMO\nTurbine manufacturers\nStakeholder self assessment DECC\nMFA\nBWEA\nDEFRA\nThe Crown Estate\nEnvironment Agency\nJNCC\nNatural England\nDfT\nDCLG\nCAA\nNational Grid\nMoD\nBIS\nDevelopers\nEWEA\nConsultants (consents)\nThe Carbon Trust\nLocal fishermen\nLeisure sailors\nParish council \nLocal population\nLDAs\nRSPB\nNFFO\nO&M contractors\nLocal businesses\nLocal protest groups\nJacking vessels\nCivil contractors\nConsultants (technical)\nCommercial fisheries\nComponent suppliers\nShipping lines\nSupport vessels\nIMO\nTurbine manufacturers\nPorts\nOFGEM\nLocal planning authority\nNumber of respondents 6 2 5 7\nNote: stakeholder group for number of respondents assigned on basis of initial assessment\n With regard to Round 1 and 2 the issues cited most frequently by \nstakeholders as causing delay to the consents process were: \nenvironmental assessments and procedures (key players & subjects), \ninfluence of other users and consultation. Specifically the division of the \nconsenting process, between local decision makers and national \nauthorities was the most cited issue for the process. The impact on radar \nwas the major issue associated with other users such as aviation and \nshipping. There was, however, a general consensus that lessons have \nbeen learnt from the consents process for Round 1 and 2, and the issues \nare now largely understood by all parties. \nAlthough delay to project timeframes was the main concern amongst \nstakeholders, other factors were consent conditions and increased costs \nwith negative impact on the economic viability of the project. Supply chain, \ntechnical (e.g. the grid) and environmental impact were also raised by \nsome stakeholders. \nWith regard to perceptions of the new consents process for Round 3, most \nof the stakeholders who responded could see improvements in \nprocedures, the time frame for considering and deciding the application, \nand greater consistency on the basis of the NPS and a single consenting \nauthority. \nHowever there were also views that there was scope for further \nimprovements to the new consents process \u2013 especially in the areas of \n process characteristics, environmental assessment, procedures and \nconsent conditions. On the wider policy side, two particular issues were \nraised: (a) continuation of the Renewables Obligation, whereby power \nsuppliers pay a penalty for each unit of electricity generated from non-\nrenewable sources, which are then recycled as subsidies for development \nof renewables (Klessmann et al., 2008; Toke, 2003)),as a means for \nimproving the economic viability of projects; and (b) government support \nfor industrialisation of the sector, including ports and the supply chain. \n4. Discussion and analysis of findings \nThe research sought to develop an understanding of the legal framework \nfor offshore wind farm consents and its implications for development.  \nFrom Fig. 2, it is clear that to deliver all round 2 projects to achieve the \n8MW forecast for 2015 will require a step change in development, and a \nfurther step change to deliver the 25GW expected of round 3. Projects \nsuffer delays at every stage, not only at consenting.  \nTwo major causes of delay identified were environmental assessments \n(EA) and procedures. EA delays resulted from having insufficient \ninformation to support the application and environmental statements (ES), \nrequiring submission of supplementary environmental information, which \nmay require additional survey work. It is necessary to understand the \nenvironmental impact of a new industry (Santora et al., 2004) and \nconsultees argue that \u201cupfront effort at scoping of the EA would have \n prevented problems of the iterative process later\u201d. There are, however, \nconcerns from industry that \u201cdevelopers are made to collect data which \nare not strictly necessary for consents\u201d.  \nThe consents process itself is described by one respondent as \u201cincredibly \nlaborious\u201d.  Time tables are open ended and there is an impression that \nregulatory authorities can take as long as they like to make decisions.  \nIneffective communication between regulators and statutory bodies, high \nstaff turnover and the under-resourcing of consultees and regulators are \nalso contributing to the delays. Considering the complexity of the issues \ninvolved, however, the time frame is not considered unreasonable \u2013 and is \nmuch shorter than it could be for other infrastructure projects such as \nnuclear power stations. \nThe third most significant issue in the consents process is the \nrepercussions of development for other users of the sea, with the potential \nimpact on aviation of radar clutter caused by turbines, obstruction to \nhelicopter movements, and impacts on fishing and shipping being the \nmost important (Plant, 2004; Plant, 2003). These issues are known to the \nstakeholders in the process and mitigation measures are being \nimplemented (DECC, 2009a). \nDelayed consents increase the project risk profile and affect economic \nviability (Carbon Trust, 2008). They make it difficult to schedule resources \nand can impact on relationships between the different stakeholders. \n Furthermore, delays to consents can mean that milestones agreed in \nlease documents become unrealistic.  \nWhen consents have been granted, associated conditions can affect the \neconomic viability of the project. Time limitations on construction activities \nto avoid disturbance during herring spawning season, can have the effect \nof reducing the available construction time during any given year to 8 \nmonths \u2013 effectively increasing the construction time frame by one third. \nFurthermore these restrictions are applied inconsistently, respondents \nreport blanket conditions being applied to areas well outside the spawning \nareas. There is concern that the precautionary approach to consents \nconditions does not reflect reality and that conditions need to be adapted \non the basis of experience. \nThere is a relationship between delays in consenting and subsequent \ndelays to the project. As a growing industry with supply chain constraints, \none respondent observes that the offshore wind industry \u201cis a sellers\u2019 \nmarket and suppliers will not enter into negotiation with developers until \nthe project has consent.\u201d There is a further complication with respect to \ngrid connection, which must be planned well in advance of the project \ncoming on-line, but must be justified against a consented development \n(Carbon Trust, 2008). \nDelays to development are not solely due to the direct or indirect effects of \nthe consents process and consent conditions. Developers may choose to \n progress one development ahead of another for their own reasons, \nincluding internal programmes, policy or resources. Other critical factors \nidentified include investor confidence in current economic climate and the \nability of the supply chain to support the huge growth in demand for high \nspecification offshore turbines that is foreseen (Carbon Trust, 2006; \nRowley and Westwood, 2003). \nExpectations for round 3 consents process \nThe Planning Act 2008 does appear to streamline the consents process, \nas demonstrated by the process diagrams presented in Figs 4 and 5 of \nthis paper. This is confirmed by the majority of respondents, although one \ndid suggest \u201cit will only cause more confusion\u201d. \nThe implications of the process are summarised by one respondent\u2019s \nstatement as: \u201cmore upfront burden on developers, but a clear time frame \nfor consents\u201d. Indeed the onus being on the developer to prepare and \nconsult on the project proposal and the environmental statement prior to \nsubmitting the consent application to the IPC is considered by many to be \na significant improvement. Although there is concern that there is a lack of \nguidance on what needs to be submitted with an application. \nThe move away from the current consenting regime with multiple consents \nand consenting authorities (Trinick, 2006), to a single consenting authority \nwith responsibility for granting all required consents is considered to be a \nmajor improvement; central decision making should build up consistency \n and experience. The time frame for the IPC to consider and decide \nconsent is also viewed as an improvement. However, given the uncertain \napplication requirements, it is unclear whether the preparation of the \napplication plus the nine months to determine consent will represent any \nsignificant improvement to the overall project time line.  \nFurthermore there are a number of concerns about the detailed \nprocedures and operation of the IPC which are seen as overly complicated \nor bureaucratic. There is a lack of clarity about onshore elements such as \nland fall of power and substations, as the Planning Act was not written \nspecifically for offshore wind. Whilst the onshore elements are small they \ncan have disproportionate impact on the overall project (Jay, 2008). \nThe huge scale of round 3, together with other potential nationally \nsignificant infrastructure projects, represents a significant workload for a \nnew organisation. There is concern that the IPC will not have the capacity \nto consider and decide all applications in the required time frame, \nparticularly in the early years. It is considered essential the commissioners \nappointed by the IPC are of sufficient calibre and experience to make the \ndecisions required of them. The potential for problems resulting from the \ninexperience of new organisations \u201cwith new people of unknown calibre, \nworking to new rules and processes\u201d was a common observation. A further \nconcern is the possibility for legal challenge as the new system develops. \n Statutory consultees observe that there is an onus them to get industry to \ninvolve them early in the process. They and the Marine Management \nOrganisation (MMO), however, are faced with competing targets and \nobligations, particularly with their environmental responsibilities. \nFurthermore more and larger projects bring a greater risk of cumulative \nand in-combination effects, which need to be understood. The introduction \nof marine spatial planning under the Marine and Coastal Access Bill \n(DEFRA, July 2009) is welcomed as a means of addressing this, and \nenabling better understanding of potential impacts on other users \n(Douvere and Ehler, 2009). \nThe supply chain and the transmission grid are both confirmed as critical \nfactors for offshore wind farm development. There is no holistic, strategic \napproach to planning issues for development of the supply industry. \nManufacturers and other businesses may need to expand premises to \naccommodate the demands of the new industry. Consents for such \ndevelopments will remain in the hands of local decision makers, who may \nhave limited knowledge of the needs of the industry. Development of ports \nto support the industry is also a significant factor, and concern was \nexpressed that \u201cwind farms will get approved but ports will be left in the \nslow lane\u201d \nFurthermore a strategic approach to grid connection is needed (Farr, \n2009), as one respondent notes \u201cgood grid connections and a robust grid \nwill effect all power sources going forward\u201d. It is anticipated that the \n National Policy Statements (NPS) will provide a framework against which \nto package grid development work (Carbon Trust, 2008). \nPolitics and policy are significant factors in the success of the new system \nand the industry as a whole. In particular the need to continue the \nRenewable Obligation to improve the economic viability of projects (BWEA \nand Garrad Hassan, 2009a). NPS and Marine Policy Statements (MPS) to \nbe produced subsequent to the passage of the Marine and Coastal \nAccess Bill, will need to be consistent and provide a clear strategic \ndirection.  \nThe importance of the sector as a growth area of the economy is being \nrecognised in UK government policy (DECC, 2009c; DECC, 2009a). A \ngeneral election is, however, expected within the next year. The \nConservative party have stated that they will repeal the Planning Act \nshould they come to power (The Conservative Party, 2009), adding \nuncertainty to the future for the consents process and increasing the risk \nassociated with round 3 projects. \nStakeholder engagement \nSelf assessment by the stakeholders of their interest in and influence over \nthe consents process largely confirms the author\u2019s initial assessment. \nThere are, however, some notable exceptions which provide insight into \nstakeholder engagement. \n Government bodies largely fall into key players and context setters; they \nhave the institutional power of decision or veto to the consents. The IPC \nand the MMO will fall into this category when they are established. All \nstakeholders with local interest fall on the boundary of subjects and crowd, \nindicating that they have similar, medium levels of interest in the process, \nwhich effects their local environment, but feel powerless over it. \nThe self assessment of local authorities as members of the crowd, rather \nthan key players as anticipated, is surprising given their current role as the \nconsenting authority for onshore works. It suggests that local authorities \nconsider they have low interest in and influence over the consents \nprocess. The limits to their jurisdiction (Jay, 2008) partly explain this. \nFurthermore one respondent reported a case where a local authority had \nrefused planning permission for onshore works, only for that decision to be \noverturned by a higher authority. Another reason may be lack of \nengagement of local authorities by developers during the preparation of \ntheir consent application. Local authorities are, however, best placed to \nunderstand what is important to their communities (Jay, 2008). This \nreinforces the need for clarity about the role of local authorities in the \nfuture consents process. \nIndustry stakeholders, being divided between subjects and crowd, have \nvarying levels of interest in the process dependent on their position in the \nsupply chain. They consider they have little power or influence over the \n consents process and instead inherit the consequences of the process, \neither as delay to their project or conditions to the consent.  \nThe movement of developers from key players to subjects suggests that \nthey believe that they have less influence over the consents process than \nanticipated. This is a cause for concern. Under the future consents \nprocess developers will need to take greater responsibility for progressing \nthe pre-application phase and ensuring the completeness of the consent \napplications (DECC, 2009a). Failure to do so risks the application being \nrejected and significant delay to the project. \nThe movement of ports to crowd from subjects indicates that they have a \nlower interest than anticipated. They join the majority of other suppliers to \nthe industry. Ports, however, have a key role to play in future \ndevelopment, as highlighted by one respondent: \u201cports form the interface \nbetween manufacturing and offshore. Ports will need to develop to support \nwind farm developers, but the extent of development falls outside that \ndefined as being of national significance in the Planning Act.\u201d  Lack of \nconsideration for the development of such support facilities and the supply \nchain may result in the transfer of these activities to other countries, and a \nmissed opportunity for the UK economy (Carbon Trust, 2008).  \n5. Conclusion \nThe aim was to answer the question: \n Is the legal framework for consents helping or hindering offshore \nwind farm development, and achievement of the targets for \nrenewable energy generation? \nThe study found that the current consents process has contributed to the \nslow rate of development of offshore wind farms, both directly and \nindirectly. Direct impacts include delays to the project as a result of the \niterative submission of environmental data and increased costs for data \ncollection. Indirect impacts have included the inability to agree supply \ncontracts and grid connections until consents have been obtained, \nimplications of delays on personnel turnover and relationships for all \nstakeholder organisations and the effects of consents conditions on the \nconstruction programme and project economic viability. As a consequence \nof these impacts the UK is struggling to meet its target for renewable \nenergy generation. \nThe new consents process under the Planning Act 2008 and Marine and \nCoastal Access Bill is more streamlined. It consolidates the consents \nrequired into a single development consent, which is granted by a single \nconsenting authority, and provides a time frame for decision. There \nremain, however, many uncertainties about the detail of its operation. The \nprocedures are unclear, and there is potential within the legislation to \nextend the time frame for decisions. Moreover, there are serious concerns \nabout the capacity and capability of the key players, the Infrastructure \nPlanning Commission (IPC), the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) \n and statutory consultees to meet their obligations given the anticipated \ngrowth of infrastructure development in all fields. This has further \nimplications for the time frame. \nThe precise extent of local authority involvement must be clarified with \nsome priority. There is substantial risk of legal challenges to the new \nprocess as it develops, particularly from populations affected by \ndevelopments.  \nBy requiring the completion of the environmental assessment and \nconsultation prior to submitting an application for development consent, \nthe new process places the onus on developers to ensure the application \nis complete. Developers need to recognise that this makes them key \nplayers in the process and take responsibility for progressing the pre-\napplication phase for each project, if momentum is to be maintained. \nWithout this, it is unclear whether the time frame for consenting decisions \nunder the future legal framework will be any better. \nThe boundaries for associated development to be consented by the IPC \nneed to be clearly defined. Whilst this may increase the IPC\u2019s workload \nassociated with individual consent applications, it may take away the \nuncertainty associated with relying on local decision-makers.  Government \nneeds to take a holistic and strategic view of the industry and consider \nhow the consenting needs for associated development of ports and the \nindustrialisation of the sector should be supported. Without this vision it is \n difficult to see how their aspirations to achieve 70,000 new jobs and \n\u00a3100bn industry are to be realised.  \n6. Further work \nIn addition to the process diagram for the current and future consents \nprocess proposed by this paper, further work is required to clarify the \ndetailed requirements for future consents applications. This may help \naddress the lack of engagement with the process felt by developers. \nFurther work to investigate the reasons for this and how to improve \nengagement would also be useful. Guidance on the role of local \nauthorities affected by developments is also required.  \nAs round 3 progresses analysis of the actual time line for consent will \nconfirm or otherwise the effectiveness of the future process. In order to \nestablish whether the IPC will be able to achieve its aims of considering \nand deciding consents in the defined time frame, further work is required \nto assess the implications of all National Policy Statements, when issued, \non demand for consents for nationally significant infrastructure projects \n(NSIP). In addition, consideration needs to be given to the boundaries of \nassociated development for such projects and whether these extend to \ninclude planning and investment of support businesses and ports.  \n References \nBurke, M.
