Introduction \nThe current and foreseeable global economy demands that material conservation becomes a matter of \nincreasing importance. Erosion and corrosion are significant causes of wastage in many high \ntemperature applications where materials such as refractories are employed. This ultimately \nnecessitates the arduous and costly undertaking of replacing the affected refractory. It is therefore \nobvious that any means whereby the life of the refractory could be extended would be of great \ninterest to all engineers, for any reduction in the wear of the refractory could bring about significant \neconomic savings. This present work is concerned with establishing and comparing the erosion and \ncorrosion characteristics of a glaze generated on the surface of an Al2O3-based refractory by means of \na CO2 laser and a high power diode laser (HPDL). \nOn account of their physical and chemical stability at high temperatures, refractory materials find use \nin application areas such as linings for furnaces and incinerators. As part of their normal operating \ncycle, the linings must withstand, amongst other things, mechanical wear due to the movement of the \ncontents and chemical attack from heated solids, liquids and\/or gasses [1]. In addition, energy \nrequirements demand that the linings provide the optimum amount of heat insulation [2]. On the one \nhand, porous refractories will act as effective insulators since porosity is inversely proportional to \nthermal conductivity [3], but on the other, such materials are susceptible to penetration by corrosive \nreagents during operation. Indeed, it is known that denser refractories degrade less because \npenetration is hindered by their more closely packed structure [4]. The protection of refractories \nexposed to aggressive high temperature environments generally depends on the formation of an \neffective diffusion barrier layer which possesses superior erosion and corrosion properties to the \nbulk. Existing methods for providing improved erosion and corrosion protection for refractories are \nbased either on tailoring the manufacturing process or using a coating. Typically, tailoring of the \nmanufacturing process involves techniques for densification of the refractory material [2]. As for \ncoatings, established technologies using chemical, mechanical and\/or thermal methods are employed \nto apply surface layers [5, 6]. However, problems such as residual stress generation, low production \nrates, coating stability, microcracking and porosity are often attendant with these methods [7, 8]. \nThe relatively recent emergence of the technology of laser materials processing offers a viable \nalternative to the existing methods for improving the erosion and corrosion resistance of refractories. \nMoreover, many of the disadvantages associated with the existing methods may be eliminated due to \nthe operating characteristics of the laser technology. In particular, the surface treatment of materials \nwith lasers has the major advantage that a large amount of energy can be focused on a small area. \nThis very localised heating means that controllability of the melt depth is possible through the \nmanipulation of the laser operating parameters. Several successful studies have shown the feasibility \n 4 \nof using lasers to improve the surface characteristics of various ceramic and composite materials. The \nremelting of ZrO2-based protective ceramic layers using a CO2 laser [9] was shown to result in a \nmarked decrease in the level of structural defects. Further, the CO2 laser remelting of a number of \noxide ceramic coatings has been found to effect significant improvements in corrosion resistance \n[10], whilst the CO2 laser remelting of Al2O3 and Al2O3-TiO2 coatings yielded an increase in hardness \nand wear resistance [11]. The remelting of ZrO2-based protective ceramic layers plasma sprayed onto \na variety of bond coats using continuous wave (CW) and pulsed CO2 lasers [12, 13] revealed that the \npulsed laser produced less cracking. The laser melting of plasma sprayed ceramic coatings based on \nAl2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 using CW and pulsed CO2 lasers [14] revealed that the extent of cracking was a \nfunction of the total energy input to the surface and the thermophysical properties of the ceramic \ncoatings. After excimer laser treatment of the surface of Al2O3, Cappelli et al. [15] noted changes in \nthe surface chemistry and morphology of the material, whilst Wu et al. [16] found that excimer laser \ntreatment of Al2O3-SiC occasioned surface smoothing and an increase in the toughness of the \nmaterial. The surface glazing of mullite with a HPDL by Schmidt and Li [17] resulted in a glaze that \nexhibited good adherence to the bulk ceramic but was severely cracked. To date, many studies have \nbeen carried out to investigate the laser surface processing of concrete. As part of nuclear plant \ndecommissioning, Li et al. [18-21] conducted research to determine the workability of several laser \ntechniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete surfaces. Work by Sugimoto et \nal. [22] focused upon modifying the surface appearance and surface properties of cement based \nmaterials using a high power CO2 laser. The resultant physical characteristics and mechanical \nbehaviour of the post-process cement based materials was later fully characterised by Wignarajah et \nal. [23]. Borodina et al. [24] has carried out investigations into the structural changes within the \ncomposition of zirconia concrete caused by surface exposure to CO2 laser radiation. More detailed \nand comprehensive studies conducted by Lawrence and Li have investigated the feasibility and \ncharacteristics of HPDL generated glazes on the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of concrete \n[25, 26]. In further work Lawrence and Li studied the generation and carried out a comparison of the \nglazes generated with both CO2 and HPDL\u2019s [27, 28]. In contrast, investigations into the laser \nprocessing of refractories are few in number. Work by Bradley et al. examined the surface treatment \nof alumina-based refractories with CO2 and HPDLs [29, 30] and a xenon arc lamp [31], whilst \nLawrence and Li [32] studied the laser beam interaction characteristics of the Al2O3-based refractory \nconsidered in this work. \n \n \n 5 \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1 Material details \nThe material used in the experiments was an Al2O3-based refractory containing various impurities. \nThe composition by weight of the refractory is as follows: Al2O3 (83.5%), SiO2 (9%), Cr2O3 (4.5%), \nP2O5 (1.6%), Fe2O3 (0.4%), TiO2 (0.3%), MgO (0.3%), NaO2 (0.2%), CaO (0.1%) and K2O (0.1%). \nThe refractory material studied is used commercially as a lining in industrial furnaces and \nincinerators. The refractory was obtained (from Cleanaway) in the form of blocks (200 x 200 x 100 \nmm\n3\n). The as-received blocks typically contained 12% porosity with aggregates of 1 to 3 mm in size \nbeing evenly distributed throughout the bricks. Furthermore, small sized cracks and porosities were \ngenerally visible on the surfaces of the as-received samples. For the purpose of experimental \nconvenience the as-received refractory blocks were sectioned into small cubes (20 x 20 x 10 mm\n3\n) \nwith only two-thirds being laser treated. The selected refractory samples were treated with both lasers \nat room temperature and in normal atmospheric conditions. \n2.2 Lasers and the processing procedure \nThe lasers used in this work were a CO2 laser (Rofin-Sinar, RS1000) emitting at 10.6 \u00b5m with a \nmaximum output power of 1 kW and a HPDL (Diomed, D120) emitting at 810\u00b120 nm with a \nmaximum output power of 120 W. The CO2 laser beam was delivered to the work surface by focusing \nthe beam through a 125 mm focal length KC1 lens to give a stable diverging beam. The HPDL beam \nwas delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 1 mm core diameter optical fibre, the end of \nwhich was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly. Both lasers were operated in the continuous \nwave (CW) mode and produced a multi-mode beam. The defocused laser beams were fired across the \nsurface of the samples (the as-received Al2O3-based refractory) by traversing the samples beneath the \nbeams using the x- and y-axis of CNC gantry tables. In both instances the laser optics were protected \nby means of a coaxially blown O2 shield gas jet a rate of 10 l\/min. In order to study accurately the \ndiffering effects of the two lasers, the power density of each was set at 2 kW\/cm\n2\n, whilst the traverse \nspeed was fixed at 120 mm\/min. Further characterisation of the laser generated glazes was achieved \nby using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis \n(EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. \n2.3 Wear testing procedure \nTo determine the wear resistance characteristics of the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes on the \nsurface of the Al2O3-based refractory, and also those of the as-received surface, wear tests were \nconducted in accordance with Fig. 1. All the samples, as-received and laser treated, were weighed \nand then clamped individually in the vice of a common shaping machine. A steel abrader was \n 6 \nattached to the floating head of the shaping machine and moved cyclically back and forth across the \nas-received and laser glazed Al2O3-based refractory surfaces. The total distance moved in one cycle \nwas 6 mm while the traverse speed was 180 mm\/min. By applying weights to the floating head a \nfrictional force of 60 N was generated. The samples were subjected to the frictional force for 8 h, \nbeing removed from the machine and weighed at 2 h intervals. \n3. Results \n3.1 Wear characteristics in normal environmental conditions \nIn the main, the resistance of any material to erosion (wear) is related primarily to the hardness of the \nmaterial in comparison with that of other materials with which it comes into contact [33]. However, \nwear resistance is not directly proportional to hardness, nor does it always increase with hardness \n[34]. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for the CO2 and the \nHPDL generated glazes, as well as those for the as-received Al2O3-based refractory surfaces. As is \nevident from Fig. 2, the wear resistance of both the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes displayed a \nsignificant increase in wear resistance over the as-received surface, with the weight loss being \napproximately 1.5 times lower after 4 h, and 3 times lower after 8 h. \n3.2 Wear characteristics in corrosive environments \nTo obtain an idea of how the corrosion resistance of the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes compared \nwith that of the as-received surface, corrosion resistance tests based upon BS 6431 [35] were \nconducted using nitric acid (HNO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The experiments were carried \nout by dropping small amounts of the corrosive agents, in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, \n20% and 10%, on to the as-received and laser glazed surfaces of the Al2O3-based refractory at hourly \nintervals for 4 h. Thereafter the samples were examined optically and subjected to the mechanical \nwear test described earlier and shown in Fig. 1. It is worth mentioning that high concentrations of the \ncorrosive agents were used to simply accelerate the tests.  \nBoth reagents in the concentrations 80% and 60% were seen to attack immediately the as-received \nsurface of the Al2O3-based refractory with a similar degree of severity. In marked contrast, both laser \nglazed surfaces displayed no discernible change in either morphology or microstructure. The \nvariation in wear resistance of the as-received surface of the Al2O3-based refractory when exposed to \nthe reagents with an 80% concentration is shown in Fig. 3. As is clearly apparent from Fig. 3, the \nwear resistance of the refractory is significantly affected when exposed to a corrosive environment. \nAs one can see, the weight loss of the as-received sample was approximately 4 times higher than \neither laser glaze after 4 h and approximately 10 times higher after 8 h for the HNO3. In the case of \n 7 \nthe NaOH, the weight loss was slightly less after both 4 and 8 h. Conversely, as can be seen in Table \n1, only a marginal increase in the wear rate was observed for both laser treated surfaces. \n4. Discussion \n4.1. Comparative analysis of the as-received surface and the CO2 and high power diode laser glazed \nsurfaces \nIt is clear from the results of the wear tests that the wear resistance characteristics of the Al2O3-based \nrefractory are greatly improved after surface glazing with either the CO2 or the HPDL. This \nimprovement in wear rate was especially apparent when the tests were conducted in corrosive \nenvironments. The marked difference in wear rate between the laser glazed and as-received Al2O3-\nbased refractory, in both normal and corrosive environments, can be attributed completely to the \ndifference in structure of the surfaces. In the as-received condition, the surface of the Al2O3-based \nrefractory is comprised of a porous, randomly ordered structure, whereas the laser glazed surfaces \nconsist of a much more dense and consolidated structure that contains fewer cracks and porosities. \nCoupled with this is the fact that the laser generated glazes are considerably harder than the as-\nreceived surface of the Al2O3-based refractory, a respective value of around 6 compared to 2 on the \nMohs scale. These two major alterations in the nature of the surface of the Al2O3-based refractory \nwill subsequently provide the laser generated glazes better wear resistance over an as-received \nsurface. In addition to the improvements in the wear resistance of the Al2O3-based refractory realised \nafter laser surface treatment, a marked difference in the corrosion resistance of the material was \nobserved after laser treatment also. Since the structure of the laser generated glazes is much more \ndense and consolidated with fewer porosities, the glaze will naturally posses a greater resistance to \ncorrosive reagents than the porous structure of the as received surface of the Al2O3-based refractory.  \n4.2. Comparative analysis of the CO2 and high power diode laser glazed surfaces \nAs is evident from both Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, there is a distinct difference in the performance of the CO2 \nlaser generated glaze and the one resulting from HPDL interaction. Such differences in performance \ncan be accounted for by the differing microstructural characteristics of the two glazes. Whereas the \nmicrostructure produced in the HPDL generated glazes consisted of fine needle-shape grains in a \nmulti-directional lattice (see Fig. 4(b)), that of the CO2 laser generated glazes took the form of a \nregular distributed coarse columnar structure (see Fig. 4(a)). Naturally the coarser microstructure of \nthe glaze resulting after CO2 laser treatment will have an adverse effect on the erosion and corrosion \nresistance of the Al2O3-based refractory. In addition, as one can see from the cross-sectional analysis \nof both of the laser generated glazes shown in Fig. 5, considerably more cracks are visible in the \n 8 \nglaze produced after CO2 laser interaction than that generated with the HPDL. Also, it is worth \nremarking that many of the cracks in the CO2 laser generated glaze extend from the surface through \nthe entire cross-section of the glaze and beyond the glaze\/substrate interface.  \nThe principal reason behind these microstructural differences, and the resulting variations in the \nerosion and corrosion performance of the laser generated glazes, is the differing rates of solidification \nensuing from interaction of the Al2O3-based refractory surface with the two lasers. Because the \nwavelengths of the two lasers are very different (10.6 \u00b5m for the CO2 and around 810 nm for the \nHPDL), then it follows that the beam absorption characteristics will be different. Indeed, Lawrence \nand Li [32] found that the length to which the beams of the CO2 and the HPDL were absorbed by the \nAl2O3-based refractory were around 345 \u00b5m and 198 \u00b5m respectively. Based on these figures it is \nreasonable to assume that since the CO2 laser beam is absorbed to a greater depth, then the melt depth \nwill be more and the resulting meltpool will be larger and will therefore cool at a slower rate than that \nof the HPDL generated meltpool. Such a observation was made during similar investigations on \nordinary Portland cement (OPC) carried out by Lawrence and Li [36, 37]. If one considers the \ntheories of constitutional supercooling and morphological stability [38-41], which are illustrated \nschematically in Fig. 6, then it is apparent that the temperature gradient and the solidification rate of a \nmeltpool govern the resulting microstructure of the solidified material. So, increasing the gradient-\nrate (G\/R) ratio causes a progressive change in the solidification characteristics, ranging from fully \ndendritic to cellular-dendritic to cellular and finally to planer front growth. On the other hand, \nincreasing the cooling rate (T=G.R) gives rise to shorter diffusion paths and finer structures. More \nsuccinctly, G\/R controls the character of the resultant microstructure, whereas the product, G.R \n(cooling rate, T) determines the scale of the microstructure. Clearly the faster rate of cooling \nexperienced by the surface of the Al2O3-based refractory after HPDL interaction effected the \nobserved finer microstructure, whilst the slower cooling rate of the Al2O3-based refractory after CO2 \nlaser treatment was responsible for the more coarse microstructure.  \nOwing to its larger size, the peak temperature of the meltpool resulting from interaction of the CO2 \nlaser with the surface of the Al2O3-based refractory will be higher than that present in the HPDL \ngenerated meltpool. This higher temperature will consequently produce higher thermal stresses. The \nthermal stress, \u03c3, induced by a thermal gradient can be calculated using the Kingery equation: \n                 \u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (1) \nwhere, E is Young\u2019s modulus, \u03b1 is the coefficient of thermal expansion and \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. \u2206T is \nthe difference between the critical temperature (below which stresses can no longer be relieved) and \nambient temperature. So, as one can see from (1), the higher value of \u2206T experienced by the CO2 \n 9 \nlaser generated meltpool will inherently have resulted in an increase in \u03c3. Moreover, the obvious \ncracking that has taken place in the CO2 laser generated glaze indicates that the induced level of \u03c3 \nwas in excess of the fracture strength of the Al2O3-based refractory. By the same token, the absence \nof any discernible signs of cracking in the HPDL generated glaze suggests that the value of \u2206T \nexperienced in the meltpool was sufficiently low enough not to raise \u03c3 above the fracture strength of \nthe Al2O3-based refractory. However, this assertion for the increased occurrence of cracks in the CO2 \nlaser generated glaze is in contradiction to the theory that a high cooling rate inherently induces \nthermal stresses which in turn can lead to crack development in order to relieve the generated thermal \nstresses.  \n4.3. Life characteristics of the as-received surface and the CO2 and high power diode laser glazed \nsurfaces \nThe all-round superior erosion and corrosion attributes of the laser generated glazes over the as-\nreceived Al2O3-based refractory surface implies that the life characteristics of the laser glazes may \nalso surpass those of the as-received Al2O3-based refractory. But in any analysis of the wear life of \nthe materials, the in-situ relative thickness of the laser generated glazes and the as-received Al2O3-\nbased refractory must be considered in order to give a true interpretation of the actual life \ncharacteristics. This is particularly true when considering the wear resistance (with and without \nexposure to corrosive chemical agents). Accordingly the increase in wear life can be given by \n Increase in wear life =  \nLaser glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n (2) \nwhere, \n)\/h(mg\/cm rateWear \n(cm) Thickness . )(mg\/cmDensity \n = lifeWear \n12\n3\n (2a) \nTable 1 summarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the laser generated glazes \nover the as-received Al2O3-based refractory. As is clearly evident from Table 1, both laser treated \nsurfaces brought about an increase in the wear life of the Al2O3-based refractory, regardless of the \nenvironment. More specifically, it can be seen that the increase in wear life of the laser generated \nglazes over the as-received Al2O3-based refractory surfaces varied markedly depending on the \nworking environment, naturally becoming more pronounced in the corrosive conditions. Furthermore, \nit is interesting to see that, despite the fact that the glaze thickness was less, the wear life of the \nHPDL treated surface exceeded that of the CO2 laser treated surface in all the test environments. \nFrom this finding it appears that the finer, more densely packed and less cracked microstructure of \n 10 \nthe HPDL generated glaze played a significant role in protecting the bulk of the Al2O3-based \nrefractory. \n4. Conclusions \nLaser treatment of the surface of an Al2O3-based refractory with CO2 and HPDL radiation was seen to \nenhance the erosion and corrosion characteristics of the material. Moreover, laser surface treatment \nwas found to effect an increase in the wear life of the Al2O3-based refractory in both normal and \ncorrosive (NaOH and HNO3) environmental conditions. Under normal conditions the wear rate of the \nas-received Al2O3-based refractory surface was 7.13 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n, increasing greatly to 51.25 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n \nand 78.75 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n when exposed to NaOH and HNO3 respectively. In contrast, only very minor \nincreases in the wear rate were experienced by both laser treated surfaces when tested in the \ncorrosive environments. Life assessment testing revealed that the CO2 laser generated glaze had an \nincrease in wear life of 1.13 to 11.79 times over the as-received surface of the Al2O3-based refractory \ndepending upon the environment. Likewise the HPDL generated glaze increased the wear life of the \nAl2O3-based refractory by 1.27 to 13.44 times depending upon the environment. The generation of \nsurfaces with improved morphology and microstructure which are more resistant to wear in normal \nand corrosive environments is cited as the reason for the observed improvements in the wear rate and \nwear life of the Al2O3-based refractory after surface treatment with both lasers. More specifically, the \nimprovements can be attributed to the fact that after laser treatment, the microstructure of the Al2O3-\nbased refractory was altered from a porous, randomly ordered structure, to a much more dense and \nconsolidated structure that contained fewer cracks and porosities. What is more, resulting from the \ndifferent rates of solidification brought about by differences in the wavelengths of the two lasers, \ndissimilar microstructures were subsequently generated. Indeed, despite the fact that the glaze \nthickness was less, the wear life of the HPDL treated surface exceeded that of the CO2 laser treated \nsurface in all the test environments owing to its finer, more densely packed and less cracked \nmicrostructure. It is believed that the economic and material benefits to be gained from the \ndeployment of the laser-based technique for generating such an effective and efficient coating on the \nsurface of the Al2O3-based refractory could be significant.  \n \n 11 \nReferences \n1.
