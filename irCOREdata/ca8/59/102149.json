Peak emission currents of 65 nA\nare measured. The carbon nanotubes being grown at low temperature by the chemical vapor\ndeposition method are defective with poor thermal conductivity. We believe it is crucial for the\nthermal conductivity to be poor in order to obtain significant thermionic emission from the carbon\nnanotubes. This allows for the carbon nanotube during electron emission to be at high temperatures,\nand thus give higher emission efficiencies. At the highest emission current levels we estimate the\ntemperature of the nanotubes to be approximately 2900 K. \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics.\n[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1790597]\nThe superior mechanical, thermal, and electrical proper-\nties of carbon nanotubes make them candidate materials for\nmany future technological applications. In particular, their\nability to carry electrical currents three orders of magnitude\nhigher than noble metals has lead to the suggestion that they\nmay make excellent nanometer-scale wires and intercon-\nnects, as they avoid the electromigration problems associated\nwith metal wires of similar dimensions.1 Indeed, the high\ncurrent carrying capacity of multiwall nanotubes has been\namply demonstrated in recent years2 and furthermore, studies\nof the failure mechanisms at these limits reported.3 In this\nstudy we investigate the high-energy transport regime in car-\nbon nanotubes, and in particular report the observation and\nmeasurement of substantial thermionic electron emission\nfrom individual multiwall carbon nanotubes.\nStudies of electrical properties of individual nanotubes\nare experimentally problematic, owing to the length scales\ninvolved. In order to address these problems there appears to\nbe two distinct approaches being developed. First, nanotube\ndispersions can be deposited onto suitable substrates, and\nthen using atomic force microscopy (AFM) individual nano-\ntubes can be isolated, and placed onto conductive tracks to\nprobe the electrical properties.4 Second, in situ manipulation\nof individual nanotubes can be performed in a suitably modi-\nfied scanning electron microscope (SEM), where nanotubes\nare selected and manuevered between sharpened tungsten\ntips.5 While both of these approaches offer certain advan-\ntages over the other, the (SEM) manipulation method allows\nelectrical properties to be determined during the manipula-\ntion process, and the ability to arrange nanotubes in three-\ndimensional space, rather than the two offered by dispersions\nof nanotubes lying on substrates. It is for this reason that the\nSEM manipulation method is the one that we have\ndeveloped6 and have used to perform the measurements re-\nported here.\nIndividual multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs),\ngrown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD),7 with typical\ndiameters of 50\u2013100 nm, still on their substrates were se-\nlected and manipulated in situ, in real time, in a SEM, using\ntwo sharpened tungsten tips electrically connected to two\nvoltage-current source meters, see Fig. 1. Each nanotube was\nremoved from the substrate and connected between the two\ntips, where a series of I-V data was collected, while still\nunder high vacuum in the SEM (better than 2310\u22126 Torr).\nTypical I-V for one of the nanotubes is shown in Fig. 2,\nwhere it can be seen that with a bias of less than +5 V,\ncurrents in excess of 30 mA are observed, corresponding to a\ndissipated power of greater than 150 mW.\nA frequent observation when the dissipated power is ap-\nproximately 100 mW or greater is that the secondary electron\nSEM signal is degraded as the voltage across the tube is\nraised, see Fig. 3. This continues until ultimately the image is\nlost and the Everhart-Thornley (ET) detector is completely\nflooded. However, subsequent reduction of the voltage across\nthe nanotube restores the SEM image. Additionally, with no\nSEM beam, but the ET detector active, we still observe a\nsignificant signal arriving at the detector, resulting in com-\nplete flooding when high power is dissipated across the\nnanotube. With a nanotube acting as a wire connection be-\ntween two much larger tips, clearly the only source of elec-\ntrons can be from thermionic emission, resulting from the\na)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ns.silva@surrey.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

To mea-\nsure this a simple copper wire detector connected to a Kei-\nthley 238 current-source meter was placed in the SEM cham-\nber near to the stage, and the tips with interconnected\nnanotube, were manuevered to within 10 mm of the wire.\nThe copper wire was then biased to +100 V as current is\nincreased through the nanotube. As the nanotube current is\nallowed to rise the copper wire begins to detect thermionic\nemission from the tube. Typically we observe 25 pA of ther-\nmionic emission current at around 20 mA nanotube current,\nrising rapidly to almost 65 nA for a rise of only 8 mA carried\nin the tube, see Fig. 4. For the nanotubes studied here, being\ntypically 10 mm long and 100 nm diameter, this corresponds\nto an emission current density slightly over 2 A\/cm2. This\nvalue is regarded as the benchmark for good thermionic\nemitters. Using the Richardson-Dushman thermionic emis-\nsion equation8,9 and making the assumption that the nanotube\nhas only a negligible temperature gradient along the length\nof the tube, we estimate emission starts at 2150 K continuing\nto a peak temperature of just under 2900 K. This value ap-\npears credible, as for significant thermionic emission to take\nplace the nanotube must first be hot enough for thermionic\nemission, but at the same time lower than 3100 K, where\nthermal vaporisation would occur.\nApplying a simple heat transfer analysis based on dissi-\npative self-heating,10 in a wire 10 mm long, 100 nm diam-\neter, dissipating 150 mW, provides an alternative approxima-\ntion of the temperature of the nanotube. Difficulty arises with\nthis method though as an accurate thermal conductivity, K, is\nrequired. Experimental values vary widely from 200 (Ref. 3)\nto 25 Wm\u22121 K\u22121 (Ref. 11) for MWNTs, which if applied here\nreveal temperatures ranging from 450\u20131300 K at peak ther-\nmionic emission. To obtain reasonable agreement between\nthe heat transfer and thermionic emission analysis would re-\nquire a thermal conductivity as low as 10 Wm\u22121 K\u22121. The\nnanotubes studied here, being grown by CVD at low tem-\nperatures, would be expected to be very defective, and hence,\nthermal conductivity poor (as was the case in Ref. 11). Of\nfurther note is that fact that most thermal conductivity values\nfor MWNTs are from experiments conducted at temperatures\nof 300 K or less, where in our case the thermionic emission\ncurrent suggests we are in excess of 2500 K where it would\nbe expected that thermal conductivity is considerably lower.\nIt is well known that in the case of black-body radiation, the\nhigher the temperature the more efficient the emission pro-\ncess. This leads to the apparent contradictory notion of a\nbetter thermionic emitter being made available with defec-\ntive nanotubes, as opposed to high crystalline quality tubes.\nThe key factor being that high-quality nanotubes with their\ncorresponding high thermal conductivity would make poor\nthermionic emitters. This may be the reason why this obser-\nvation of thermionic emission has not been reported previ-\nously, as most high-energy studies have concentrated on high\nquality nanotubes.\nFIG. 2.

We have observed no significant\nchanges in our experiments, over the duration of several\nminutes, and a further study is underway to investigate both\nthe longer-term stability, and the relationship between nano-\ntube crystalline quality and thermionic properties.\nIn summary, we have observed significant thermionic\nemission from individual MWNTs. This emission is probably\nmade possible due to the MWNTs being grown at low tem-\nperature, and are therefore defective, resulting in a poor ther-\nmal conductivity. This raises the possibility of using similar\nMWNTs as miniature electron sources for e-beam and x-ray\ninstruments and display applications.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the EPSRC U.K.\nfor providing funding in the form of a Portfolio Partnership\nAward and the Carbon Based Electronics Programme award.\n1Electromigration and Electronic Device Degradation, edited by A.
