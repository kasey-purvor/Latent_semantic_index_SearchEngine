The paper explores different dimensions of power that emerged during the project \u2013 sources of power, power as resistance, reasons for the power struggle, and power as exercised, We conclude that, while power issues in ISD projects are by no means a new phenomenon, these power issues were exacerbated in this IOIS project due to the project governance structures necessary to coordinate several organisations.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Paper presented at the 17th European Conference on Information Systems in Vienna, 8-10 June 2009.
