The paper discusses\nsome fundamental issues in the production of computer-based materials, and considers them in the context\nof an on-going evaluation of an Internet courseware project.\nAlthough most instructional systems arise from enthusiasm for realizing an educational goal, all too often\nthe educational problems the educator is trying to address are overshadowed by system design\nconstraints. Often, the subordination of educational issues to implementation issues reflects an inadequate\nunderstanding of how pedagogic requirements map onto system design decisions - and at what cost. It is\nall too easy to become engrossed in the challenges of implementation (in what is possible), especially if the\npedagogic motivations (what is desirable) are not clearly established, and if their attendant instructional\nstrategies are not firmly specified. Focusing on what is possible tends to lead to simple translations of\nexisting materials into a new medium, whereas reflecting on what is desirable has the potential of\nidentifying underlying goals and supporting them through transformation of practice into a form that\nexploits the particular advantages of an alternative technology.\nThis familiar story is characterized in the experiences of the EONT project, described in this paper, which\nbegan as an initiative to transform paper-based materials into Internet courseware. These issues are exam-\nined in the context of a comparison of two generations of systems developed for an HCI course. The first\nsystem, although it set out with ambitions to address specific learning requirements, was overtaken by\nimplementation issues. The specification and resulting product, a fairly direct translation of existing\nmaterials, were a realization of the possible. In contrast, the second system began with an analysis of peda-\ngogic problems with a particular attempt to address structure issues such as access. These goals were\nanalysed, categorized and prioritized to provide some coherence to the desirable instructional design driving\nthe implementation. The conclusion from these experiences illustrate that particular attention to pedagogical\ndesign is not the only factor in improving Internet courseware: it is necessary to strive for an on-going\ndialogue between educator and developer to achieve a prioritized set of agreed goals which guards against\nthe pragmatics of real-world development producing the least important and easiest options first.\nDrawing back from technological opportunism\nThe popularity of the Internet has infected education, particularly distance education,\nwith technological opportunism. Educators feel the 'technology pull' of Web applications\nand want to experiment. I have talked to colleagues from around the world, and their\nstories about new developments usually start with the technology, for example: 'We wanted\n70\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nto see what we could do with Java.' Reinhardt (1995, 55) predicts an optimistic future with\nimproved educational productivity and qualitatively changing learning profiles - he\npredicts an improvement in learning due to technology alone. But do simple Internet\ntranslations of existing materials offer anything more to the student, or do we need other\nstrategies for the effective exploitation of the Internet for teaching?\nOne of the difficulties, both in developing and in evaluating Internet courseware, lies in the\nrelationship between technology and pedagogy. We reassert the familiar argument that\n'technology pull' should be subordinated to 'pedagogic push'. The rise of technology has\nnot changed the fundamental educational issues:\n\u2022 How can we identify students' needs and address them effectively?\n\u2022 How can we accommodate student diversity, particularly when we are remote from our\nstudents?\n\u2022 How can we maximize individual feedback within the constraints of ever-decreasing\nresources?\nThe hope is that we can address such issues with new tools, that we can add value through\nnew media. But we have yet to understand the costs of new tools.\nCognitive cost. We have been indoctrinated into book use over years; the book 'interface' is\nlearned and made familiar through many instantiations throughout our lives. But Internet\npresentation carries a new cognitive overhead: the acquisition of the many-layered interface\n(operating system, network software, applications, 'documents', etc.). 'Sexy' is not the same\nas 'effective'; sometimes simple, familiar mechanisms work better. Experience has shown\nthat it is easy to propose an electronic solution that is more expensive and time-consuming\nthan the paper-based system it is supposed to improve upon (Pilgrim and Leung, 1996).\nDesign cost. Although most instructional systems arise from enthusiasm for realizing an\neducational goal, all too often the educational problems the educator is trying to address\nare overshadowed by system design constraints. The subordination of educational issues to\nimplementation issues often reflects an inadequate understanding of how pedagogic\nrequirements map onto system design decisions - and at what cost.\nIt is all too easy to become engrossed in the challenges of implementation (what is\npossible), especially if the pedagogic motivations (what is desirable) are not clearly\nestablished, and their attendant instructional strategies are not firmly specified. Focusing\non what is possible tends to lead to simple translations of existing materials into a new\nmedium, whereas reflecting on what is desirable has the potential of identifying underlying\ngoals and supporting them through transformation of practice into a form that exploits\nthe particular advantages of an alternative technology. In the sections that follow, these\nissues are examined in the context of an on-going evaluation of an Internet courseware\nproject, through a comparison of two generations of systems developed for an HCI\n(Human-Computer Interaction) course.\nThe OU's interest in the Internet\nAs a distance-teaching university, the Open University (OU) is keen to investigate the use\nthe Internet for teaching. We have been investigating its use as a communication medium\n71\nUndo Carswell Possible versus desirable in instructional systems: who's driving?\nfor more than three years, including considering the impact of the Internet as a\npresentation medium (Thomas et al, 1998). OU course materials differ in nature from\nthose of conventional universities: they typically involve a three-year development\nprogramme producing materials which have a five- to eight-year life cycle. Hence, they have\na high initial production cost which is amortized over a number of years of large-scale\ndissemination. While this system produces high-quality materials, it also tends to be slow-\nmoving and conservative. Superficially, the Internet appears to afford a feasible\nopportunity to produce courses more quickly and flexibly. Materials could be placed on\nthe Web, allowing ready updates without the overheads of publishing and warehousing,\nand students could use them as and when required. However, merely using the Internet as a\npublishing medium is inadequate support for distance education. Where is the teaching?\nWhen development issues dominate\nAs part of our on-going research into teaching via the Internet, we collaborated with\nEuropean partners in a project to investigate whether there would be real gains for\ndistance-learning students using Web-based learning materials (EONT: an Experiment in\nOpen and distance-learning using New Technologies). Our research had already shown\nthat using the Internet as a communication medium neither improved nor impaired\nlearning outcomes despite anecdotal claims to the contrary (the research was presented in\na paper given at the ACM SIGCSE\/SIGCUE conference, ITiCSE '97, Uppsala, Sweden,\nJune 1997), but its real and often understated value lay in the flexibility it provided\nstudents. Pursuing these observations, we were keen to establish what materials could and\nshould be offered, and where any authentic benefits lay for the student.\nThe project aimed to address pedagogic issues; there was enthusiasm about the dual\npotential to provide something innovative for our students while addressing the publishing\nproblem of quickly-dating material. However, in the absence of a clear and strongly-driven\npedagogy design plan, the project yielded to the overwhelming push of the technology, and\nwas shaped by its limitations and resource implications. These were twofold:\n\u2022 choice of tool - this was driven by project-political issues, thus the design was\nconstrained by a tool rather than a tool chosen to fit the design\n\u2022 getting it done - it was more important to have the materials in this form than it was to\nget it right.\nThe resulting courseware consisted of basic HTML documents with some marginal\nimprovements. It had lost the functionality and richness of a well structured book. Such a\ntranslation was not the initial aim; it became apparent that the implementation constraints\nhad produced 'could be' instead of 'should be' Internet courseware. This outcome is an\nexample of the possible, when implementation drives the design.\nHowever, while this was a disappointment in design terms, it was useful as a research tool.\nThis 'pure' translation provided a baseline for comparisons to the original paper-based\ncourse material and to a second phase of development.\nWhat the students thought\nWhile we understood that there were limitations to this basic book-to-internet translation,\n72\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nit was important to understand from a student perspective if there were any gains in this\ntype of presentation. A group of typical users participated in an informal evaluation in\nwhich the interface was assessed and users performed set tasks in order to provide some\ninsight into students' methods and requirements. The overwhelming feedback from\nstudents was their lack of preference for this format; they did not anticipate using the\ncourseware very often. The only perceived value was as a source of reference and only then\nif they were near the computer. Some of their concerns are characterized below.\n\u2022 Not optimized for usefulness. While the software was considered easy to use, it was not\nconsidered useful. It lacked the maturity of a well-structured book which could support\na variety of access strategies through devices such as the headings, index, glossary, and\ntable of contents. Students disliked reading text on screen.\n\u2022 More cross-referencing required. Again, this appeared to be a structural issue; the cross-\nreferencing would provide students with a variety of routes to the information.\n\u2022 Cannot see different components simultaneously. When using a book, students had the\nability to 'look' at different sections at one time, e.g., flicking between the sections\n'book-marked' with their fingers. This sort of quick swapping was not supported by the\nInternet version.\n\u2022 Not enough interactivity. The materials suffered from a general lack of interactivity (as\nis common in most courseware). However, the students viewed access as interaction:\nmoving readily through relevant information would allow them to engage with the\nmaterial. Hence, more sophisticated interactivity seemed to be less important than the\nprovision of an adequate structure to support flexible and responsive access.\n\u2022 Unexpected aesthetics. Students expect text, colours and screen layout to conform to a\nfamiliar range which they have experienced, i.e., they expect conformance to stereotype.\nThis group of evaluators was experienced with Microsoft products and common Web\nbrowsers, and they expected features which looked like familiar widgets to behave like\nfamiliar widgets. Unusual colours and behaviour inconsistent with stereotype were\nfound to be jarring.\n\u2022 Inconsistent interface. This complaint was mentioned repeatedly throughout the\nnavigation of the software. After coming to terms with the meaning and functionality\nof icons, students (predictably) experienced frustration and difficulty when the icons\ndid not behave in a similar fashion in different contexts. However 'inconsistent\ninterface' was also used to describe inconsistency with stereotype-students accustomed\nto a particular interface characterised the unfamiliar interface as inconsistent.\nThis review highlighted some interesting issues. First, little-to-no-benefit was identified by\nthe evaluators as accruing from a basic translation of print to electronic form. The\nstudents indicated its likely usefulness as minimal. The Internet was not appealing as a\npublishing medium. Its main disadvantages were the overhead of understanding and\nbecoming familiar with the interface, and the undesirable requirement to read volumes of\ntext on screen (or alternatively to bear the cost of printing).\nSecond, making the structure of the material (both interface and content) evident is\nimportant. The students expected the Internet courseware to offer improved functionality.\n73\nLinda Oirswell Possible versus desirable in instructional systems: who's driving?\nBooks have the advantages of portability and familiarity over a computer; students\nexpected other added-value factors in compensation, such as more flexible structure,\ninteractivity, and improved access to information.\nPedagogic push\nWe decided to discard the first piece of courseware and begin again, with a resolve to let\nthe pedagogy drive the design. For the second system, we adopted a principled approach to\nthe design of web-based materials by concentrating on student requirements, starting with\nthe issues of structure and access identified in the first evaluation. The responses had\nemphasized that access should be flexible (supporting many routes and strategies) while\nusing obvious, consistent mechanisms.\nSupporting flexible access while providing clear insight into underlying structure appeared\nto be a sensible approach to addressing individual student needs. The Internet is heralded\nas a mechanism for flexible learning modes which can support student diversity (Steeples et\nal, 1996) (Watabe, Hamalainen and Whinston, 1995). Here, then, might be a point at which\ntechnology serves pedagogy. We reviewed the literature on learner traits and more\nparticularly on cognitive controls and cognitive styles as a means to understanding how we\ncould structure information for different types of learners. We examined these dimensions\nto provide insights into how learners process, reason, gather and organize information.\nCognitive controls\nCognitive controls are derived from our mental abilities and form patterns of human\nthinking or reasoning in individuals. Each cognitive control is a separate representation of a\npattern of thinking. Cognitive controls differ from cognitive styles in that they are psycho-\nanalytical and regulate perception. These influence an individual's perception of\nenvironmental stimuli (Jonassen and Grabowski, 1993). Cognitive styles are tendencies that\ndefine learner traits and reflect an individual's perceptual habits and are stated in terms of\ntypical performance. Field dependence\/independence is one cognitive control that provides\ninformation on how students differ in their preference for information structuring.\nField dependence\/independence\nThis is the most extensively researched cognitive control and is the most prescriptive of\nlearning and instructional outcomes. FD\/I describes the degree to which a learner's\nunderstanding is influenced by the surrounding contextual or perceptual field (Liu and\nReed, 1994). Field dependents find it difficult to separate important from unimportant\ninformation; what they are looking for is often masked by the surrounding information.\nThey will store information and encode it without reordering, restructuring or revision.\nField independents, on the other hand, are more likely to recognize, restructure, or\nreorganize information to their own needs. They have an articulated cognitive style as they\nprefer to create their own models for understanding the domain. They are better at\nexpressing their own knowledge as they impose their own structures on it. Most learners\nfall somewhere in between, and share aspects of each in different concepts. FD\/I is not a\nstatic trait and changes over a learner's life span from generally field dependent, as a child,\nto field independent, as an adult and gradually decreasing in field independence in later\nyears (Jonassen and Grabowski, 1993). Field independence also seems to increase with the\namount of formal education. However, this demonstrates that FDs have more difficulty in\n74\nALT-] Volume 6 Number I\nimposing their own structure on information and would likely benefit from some already\nprovided structure upon which they could, at least initially, rely.\nCognitive styles\nCognitive styles can be described as consistent characteristics of the learner (which develop\nas a result of underlying personality trends) which indicate how they process information\n(Riding and Cheema, 1991). Learners differ in how they process information and interact\nwith their environment; these are not cognitive controls and abilities (although they are\nlinked to them) but preferences which reflect personality traits. For example, abilities are\ncompetencies which are stated in terms of maximal performance; styles are propensities\n(tendencies or inclinations) which are described in terms of typical performance. The value\nof such traits is in the recognition of individual differences and the preferences that\nlearners may display in processing information. Such knowledge can help develop\nstrategies to support appropriate structuring of information and flexibility in learning\n(Messick, 1984). There are two different cognitive styles which we will consider for\ndifferent reasons. One (visualizer\/verbalizer) indicates how learners gather information,\nand the other (seralist\/holist) indicates how they organize information.\nVisualizer\/verbalizer. This ^ describes learner preferences for processing information either\nby seeing (through diagrams, graphics, or illustration) or through words (either by reading\nor listening). Visualizers tend to think more concretely, preferring pictures, diagrams, etc.\nto augment text-based material. Verbalizers are more objective about information they are\nlearning. Some learners are equally comfortable with both modes, and the differences in\nthis cognitive style are not as great as others. There are alternative classifications for this\ndimension such as high and low imagery (Jonassen and Grabowski, 1993). This dimension\nalso has a relationship with FD\/I: visualizers are more field dependent, whereas verbalizers\nare more field independent.\nSeralist\/holist. This is a bi-polar dimension which describes the extent to which a learner\nselects and represents information. Holists use global, thematic approaches to learning and\nfocus on several aspects of the same subject at the same time. They have many goals and\nworking topics that span different levels of the hierarchical structure. They use complex\nlinks to relate different levels of information, and establish an ordering essentially top-down\nin approach. Pask (1976) describes a holist's deficiency as inability to focus on detail.\nSerialists use a bottom-up operations approach to learning; they focus narrowly on detail\nbefore conceptualizing an overall picture. They use simple links between concepts and use\nthese to develop objective, logical arguments. Pask identified deficiencies in serial learning\nas ignoring important connections. Versatile learners will employ both serialist and holist\nlearning strategies and will be able to resolve conflict over several opposing theories by using\nglobal and detailed approaches. They succeed in achieving a full or deep understanding that\nis comprised of both descriptions and procedures, and are proficient at learning from all or\nmost modes of instruction. FD\/I has a relationship with this dimension also: holists are\nrelated to field dependents; serialists are related to field independents.\nThe pedagogical goals\nAll three dimensions described are linked in several ways. First, they are connected by their\nassociation with information processing, reasoning, gathering and organizing. Second, the\n75\nLinda Carswell Possible versus desirable in instructional systems: who's driving?\nimplications for improvement strategies for some of these types of learners are the\nstructuring of information. And third, there is a relationship between the FD\/I dimension\nand the serialist\/holist dimension, and the FD\/I dimension and the visualizer\/verbalizer\ndimension (Ford, 1995). It is clear in examining these dimensions that some types of\nlearners can benefit from structure.\nBut what kind of structure should be provided? By analysis, we derived three categories of\ninformation structuring: access, concept ordering, and information representation. We chose\nto focus on accessing information in the second phase of development; the main\neducational objectives were to develop strategies which would address the 'deficiencies' of\nfield dependents, holists and visualizers by focusing on the access aspects of structuring\ninformation.\nInstructional strategies for software implementation\nHaving identified the particular educational objectives of the second prototype, the next\nstep was mapping them onto some kind of instructional design strategy: deciding what the\nstructuring and access devices would look like and how they would operate. We brain-\nstormed, and reviewed other courseware products for ideas - especially those that provided\nmultiple information access routes such as Encarta. From this exploration, we drew a list\nof access mechanisms which could be mapped onto our pedagogical objectives. In\naddition, we planned to address the interactivity issue by providing a non-functional icon\ndrawing tool, to allow HCI students to develop interfaces.\nThe developer was excluded from our initial planning as a deliberate tactic to debate our\nideas without regard to technical constraints. The desire was to examine what it was we\nwere trying to achieve, and how and why this might improve the learning materials for the\nstudents - to make pedagogy drive and technology serve.\nSubsequently, after several meetings, the developer was involved and a specification was\ndrawn up of the types of innovations we wanted to include in our design. More specifically,\nit enumerated the types of structure that would meet our pedagogical requirements:\nglossaries of terms, contents list, definitions, index, keyword searching, pop-up windows,\nannotations, navigational aids (with typical menus, etc.) to support flexible and speedy\naccess to information, and searches specifically matched to topic or assignment. The plan\nwas pedagogically-driven, supported by a good working relationship with the developer\nand agreed a set of goals.\nHowever, while, superficially, communication with the developer was fine, at a deeper level\nthere were major communication problems. The expectations of the 'woolly' educator were\nat odds with the developer's priority for demonstrable productivity. The problem lay not\nwith the pedagogic plan, but with the failure to articulate that plan as prioritized imple-\nmentation goals. As the project proceeded and deadlines approached for the completion of\nthis phase, it became apparent that, while there were major improvements, all was not as\nwe had hoped. The developer focused on capturing the content first and then began\nimposing the structure, whereas the innovations in structure and access mechanisms were\nthe educators' priority. The developer's pragmatic approach meant that less important\nalbeit high-volume aspects were completed first, leaving the innovations to last. Therefore,\nsome goals were neglected because time and financial resources were exhausted. The\ntypical problems could be summarized as:\n76\nALT-] Volume 6 Number I\n\u2022 the developer's desire to revert to familiar tried and tested solutions - the developer\ndoes not want to be credited with a failure;\n\u2022 the developer's desire to complete specific tasks first based on technical arguments - the\neducator lacks technical expertise or experience to know whether such arguments are\nvalid, and usually succumbs to the developer's wishes;\n\u2022 the educator's inability to articulate a specification with a set of prioritized goals -\ndevelopers will make their own set of prioritized goals, which is to produce something\nthat is tangible and works;\n\u2022 the educator lacks experience in developing teaching materials in this medium - this\nleads to confusion and a lack of confidence.\nWe had avoided the normal pitfalls of development seduction: trying to do everything at\nonce, trying to produce a universal system, one-more-feature disease, doing things because\none can (and mistaking that for progress). However, the project was jeopardized by the\ndifference of perspective and of objectives between developer and educator.\nThe lessons are that educator and developer need to prioritize components of the\nspecification and articulate that agenda as implementation priorities. The educator needs\nto 'hold onto the reins', especially ensuring that, when reality intervenes with constraints,\ndecisions are based on educational priorities, rather than technical convenience. The\ndeveloper's strategies tend to overlook pedagogic reassessment when compromises are\nrequired.\nDiscussion\nOverall, the project provides an essential lesson on the importance of sustaining\neducational priorities through all phases of design and implementation. The first phase of\nthe project was guided by what was technically and practically possible; pedagogy followed\ntechnology. This seems to be an illustration of one of the fundamental problems with\nInternet developments: people do things because they can within the constraints of budget,\ntime, and experience. Instead of looking for solutions to things we want or need and really\npushing the technology to come up with solutions (educational push), we accept available\ntechnical offerings and succumb to technology pull.\nThe first phase of the Internet courseware, largely a direct translation of the original\npaper-based materials, illustrated that there are real questions about the value of a simple\ntranslation of paper-based learning materials into HTML documents. Although it was a\ndisappointment in terms of design, it gave us a baseline for comparison so that we could\ninvestigate the value of simple translation. Just moving material onto the Web incurs\nadditional overheads for students; we have a culture of book use inculcated over years, but\nwe do not yet have a comparable culture of Web-page access and Web-page usage. Students\nwho come to this naively have the burden - the extra cognitive load - of developing new\nstrategies for coping with accessing Internet-based material as well as having the material\nin this alternative form. The structure of the material, or lack of it, may increase the\ncognitive load further: students spend more time trying to understand how to access the\ninformation than using it (Molnar and Sharda, 1996).\n77\nLinda Carswell Possible versus desirable in instructional systems: who's driving?\nThe second phase of the project was intended to be pedagogically driven. The educational\ngoals were identified through analysis and experience; the second phase aimed to address\nparticularly the deficiencies of the previous Internet presentation. An analysis of the\nliterature provided us with a framework for understanding what types of students could\nbenefit from enhanced structuring and how that structure should be manifest. This match\nbetween the students' requirements and the literature forms a sound basis for design\ndecisions and warrants further scrutiny.\nThe second phase of the project was notionally guided by what was desirable educationally.\nOur difficulty was in mapping design decisions to implementation priorities. The\ndifficulties here gave us reason to reflect on why so many high-minded educational projects\nseem dominated by technical convenience - and especially to consider the quality of the\ndialogue between the educator and the developer. The educator has some educational goals\nand notionally some technical aspirations. The developer has technical knowledge, includ-\ning a knowledge of constraints. In the absence of a clear educational vision which is\ncarried into the management of the technical development, the developer ends up leading\nthe project. Inevitably the developer leads the project into decisions which are productive -\nfrom the development perspective. Developers will aim for familiar, 'reliable' solutions,\ninstead of reaching for the kind of infrastructure, support structure and tools that actually\nprovide added value. The tendency to settle for safe-but-possible courseware may account\nfor why so many projects which set out with enthusiasm and ambition turn out to be so\nmundane.\nThe EONT project demonstrates the importance of the educator-developer dialogue. The\nlesson is that the educator must develop the leadership to overcome the conservatism of\ndevelopers, and to set and maintain a pedagogically-driven agenda. It is not sufficient to set\nthe project aims from a pedagogical perspective: there is a need also to prioritize\nimplementation objectives. All initial objectives may not be realizable. The advantage of\nsetting priorities on implementation goals means that the aspects of the design most\nimportant from a pedagogical perspective can be tackled first, and if the project fails to\ncomplete all its intended goals then the result will at least include some of the more\ndesirable and innovative features.\nConclusion\nFervour for the Internet is a catalyst to experiment with a new technology that may address\nsome of our educational needs. Although we all set out with ambitions to address specific\nlearning requirements, if we lack a clear pedagogical plan, implementation issues\ndominate. Given our inexperience in this area and the all-too-familiar seduction of 'sexy'\ntechnology, we produce the possible: translations which are mundane and offer little\nimprovement over their printed counterparts.\nWhile the EONT project was limited from a pedagogical perspective, its lessons are clear.\nWe need to start from pedagogical aims and look for added value in areas that matter (that\nmatter to students, that affect learning). A pedagogical plan which is founded on the\nliterature, analysis of experience, and students' requirements is a principled framework for\ndesign. However, a pedagogical plan is not enough to ensure a wholly successful product.\nIn the absence of a prioritized set of implementation goals, the developer concentrates on\n78\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nthe more realizable goals first, often the less innovative, mundanely high-volume aspects\nsuch as content. In the real world, with resource constraints, innovations left to the end\nmay never actually be completed. Addressing this issue requires the development of an\neducator-led, continuing dialogue with the developer.\nWe need to be aware of development hazards and be sure that pedagogy drives the design.\nWe need to develop a continuing dialogue with the developer and prioritize goals to ensure\nthat the most desirable features of the design are completed first, not last. And we need to\nhave respect for modest gains: not all our dreams are realizable in one project.\nWe must analyse our existing processes deeply and critically in order to provide fully - and\nappropriately - realized Internet teaching that serves learning at least as well, and at least\nas economically, as conventional methods. This paper takes the pragmatic stance that the\nkey to successful application of technology in education is good teaching: making\ntechnology a cost-effective servant of pedagogy.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to express my thanks in particular to Marian Petre and Laurie Keller for their\nediting assistance, and to the other members of the EONT Research Team: Marian Petre,\nDebbie Stone, Mark Woodroffe.
