INTRODUCTION\nI N THE continuous casting of steel [1], control of moltensteel delivery through the pouring nozzle, that is, a sub-\nmerged entry nozzle (SEN) (see Fig. 1), is critical to ensure an\noptimum laminar flow pattern in the casting mold and stable\nmeniscus. The flow regime in the SEN influences the billet sur-\nface quality, cleanliness, and hence the value of the cast product.\nThis is particularly important for casting low carbon aluminum\nkilled steel as the flow profile is readily disrupted by the clog-\nging problem due to the deposition of aluminum oxide particles\non the inside of the SEN wall and exit ports [2], [3]. Achieve-\nment of a stable and quiescent flow between the tundish and\nManuscript received December 19, 2003; revised October 15, 2004.

Location of the submerged entry nozzle in the continuous casting\nprocess, where the position of noncontact electromagnetic sensor is also shown.\ncasting mold is determined by a number of interrelated casting\nparameters, including steel mass flow rate, tundish metal level\n[4], pouring nozzle diameter [2], argon gas flow rate [5], and the\namount of clogging within the stopper\/slide gate and pouring\nnozzle. Typical examples of steel flow patterns within an SEN\nare annular flow (a stream with a central air gap), central stream,\nand bubbly flow (argon bubbles with the stream) with the pos-\nsible transition between flow modes during casting depending\non the flow rate of steel and gas for the given casting conditions.\nAn online flow visualization approach utilizing rugged and non-\ninvasive sensors would be highly desirable.\nMuch effort has been made in developing a wide variety of\ntomographic techniques for industrial process applications over\nthe past two decades. For example, the use of X-rays can be\nconsidered as a proven method to visualize the flow of liquid\nsteel [6], [7]. However, X-rays suffer from the inherent haz-\nards of radiation and size of the equipment. Electrical tech-\nniques have received much attention recently for a number of\nprocess applications, especially online monitoring and control,\nthus providing inexpensive and nonintrusive imaging systems\nwith low, but sufficient, image resolution of the internal mate-\nrial distributions within the processes [8], [9]. Electromagnetic\ninductance tomography (EMT), which requires custom data ac-\nquisition system and physical inductive sensors, uses magnetic\ncoupling between sensors to provide images that represent the\ndistributions of electrically conductive and magnetically perme-\nable material within the object space. This relatively new tomo-\ngraphic technique has been researched for the similar problem\nof imaging molten metal solidification [10], [11]. Eddy-current\ntechniques have also been utilized in monitoring phase trans-\nformation of steel samples in a hot strip mill [12] and character-\n1530-437X\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nMA et al.: ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNIQUES FOR IMAGING CROSS-SECTION DISTRIBUTION 225\nizing the Bridgman crystal growth processes by monitoring the\nliquid\u2013solid interface shape and location [13].\nThis paper focuses on molten steel flow profile imaging\nin the continuous casting nozzle based on a prototype EMT\ninstrument. Previous investigative research using a sensor array,\nconsisting of a single transmitter and three pairs of balance\ncoils, has shown that the type of flow profile and flow rate\nhas differentiable effects upon the coil outputs [14], [15].\nCentral stream flow causes a relatively small signal change in\nsensor voltage due to the small volume of metal available for\neddy-current induction. Bubbly and annular flows are generally\nlarge steel bodies, which increase eddy currents, hence signal\nchanges. Bubbly and annular flows can be differentiable at\nincreased operating frequencies as bubbles in the bubbly flow\nimpede the induced eddy-current flow at high frequencies.\nPrevious tests have also shown that a significant reduction in\nthe flow rate produces a partial flow in the pouring nozzle,\nwhich results in large variances in signal, as large cavities are\nsporadically present in the sensor space.\nThe design of such an instrument must consider the effects\nof the environment upon the sensor and hence the instrument\nsystem. The operational temperature, which varies between\n1000\u20131500 C, demands that the sensor array should be low\ncost, easily maintainable, and constructed from materials\ncapable of enduring such high temperatures. Low-input capac-\nitance is essential in order to maximize the resonant frequency.\nHowever, long cables, which are generally required between\nthe sensor array and instrument during hot trails, introduce\nextra input capacitance, thus reducing the resonant frequency\nof the system. The pouring nozzle wall will induce eddy cur-\nrents when an alternating magnetic field is incident due to the\nmaterial being electrically conductive; this affects the selection\nof the optimum excitation frequency.\nThis paper starts with an overview of electromagnetic\nimaging techniques. The construction of the sensor array and\nassociated electronics are then discussed, followed by sen-\nsitivity map analysis and a description of the applied image\nreconstruction algorithm. Images, as reconstructed from cold\nsample measurements and hot pilot plant trials, are presented.\nThis paper will be the first to present tomographically recon-\nstructed images of real molten steel flows through a submerged\nentry nozzle. The aim of such a system is to determine, and\nultimately visualize, steel flows within the SEN from which\nflow regime knowledge is created, thus enabling improved\ncontrol over casting conditions.\nII. EMT\nEMT, also termed mutual inductance tomography (MIT) [16],\n[17], maps spatial distribution of electrical conductivity or mag-\nnetic permeability through the measurement of magnetic cou-\npling between inductive sensors. The underlying principle be-\nhind the technique can be described generally as follows: The\nobject space is energized with a sinusoidally varying magnetic\nfield created through excitation coils. Electrically conductive or\nferromagnetic objects inside the space causes distortion to the\nmagnetic field due to induced eddy currents in the test objects.\nThe resultant field changes are measured on the object space\nperiphery with an array of detection coils. The corresponding\nvoltage measurements are fed into a PC host computer. Based\non a series of measured coil outputs and through utilizing re-\nconstruction algorithms, the PC computer is able to produce\nan image of the internal material distribution. Molten steel is\na conductive media as the temperature exceeds the Curie point\nand cannot be detected magnetically as it displays no magnetic\nproperties [12]. The electrically conductive molten steel causes\na reduction in the detected signal due to Faraday\u2019s law and there-\nfore only the electrical conductivity is imaged.\nFor EMT, the forward problem is to predict the sensor\noutputs for a given material distribution with known electro-\nmagnetic properties. Analytical approaches are suitable for\nsolving forward problems for ideal geometries with simplified\nassumptions; numerical approaches, such as finite-element\nmethods (FEM), are used to calculate approximately the\nforward problems in the general case. The inverse problem,\nthrough the utilization of image reconstruction techniques, is\nto convert the measured data into an image which represents\nthe original material distribution. The reconstruction problem\nof conductivity mapping in EMT is an ill-posed and ill-condi-\ntioned problem as the number of pixels in an image is usually\nmuch larger than the number of the limited measurements. This\nproblem is further complicated by the soft field effect, whereby\nthe object material affects both the magnitude and direction\nof the interrogating field. Therefore, the measured induced\nvoltage is a nonlinear function of electrical conductivity of\nthe test objects. There is no direct approach to solving this\ninverse problem. It is generally necessary to use nonlinear\nreconstruction methods such as the regularized Gauss\u2013Newton\nmethods to achieve desirable images where each step in such\nan iterative method is treated as a regularized linear step [18].\nHowever, assumptions are made of the system that simpli-\nfies the image reconstruction problem. Assuming the system to\nbe linear so that pixel interactions are ignored, which is a very\ncoarse approximation to reality, the system is described by a ma-\ntrix equation\n(1)\nwhere is the measurement data and the image pixel values.\nVector contains elements, the total number of pixels in the\nobject space, whereas vector contains elements, which rep-\nresents the total number of independent measurements, i.e., the\nnumber of unique coil pairs to be measured. The two-dimen-\nsional matrix of rows and columns contains the sensi-\ntivity coefficients, which reflect the response of each pixel to a\nparticular measurement.\nFor the image reconstruction problem as described in (1), the\npixel contrasts in need to be solved as the measured vector\nand the sensitivity matrix are already known. However, a\nreconstruction algorithm is required as the inverse of matrix\nis not directly available. There is a range of possible EMT re-\nconstruction algorithms [19]; however, for this project, a Simul-\ntaneous Increment Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) was em-\nployed, which is detailed in the following section.\n226 IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, VOL. 5, NO. 2, APRIL 2005\nFig. 2. Block diagram of the experimental system. The system consists of a sensor array, data acquisition unit, associated conditioning circuitry, and a PC\ncomputer, which were purposely designed and constructed for hot trials.\nIII. EMT IMAGING SYSTEM\nA. Experimental System\nThe initial investigative system based on an impedance\nanalyzer approach proved that the use of electromagnetic\napproaches to visualize simple geometries was possible [14],\n[15]. However, an automated system is required for hot pilot\nplant trials. The instrument system, as schematically illustrated\nin Fig. 2, was designed and constructed to achieve the hot test\naims. The 5-kHz 10-V ac signal is provided from a Hewlett\nPackard waveform generator. The conditioning electronics\nconvert the 5-kHz voltage source to a current signal, which\nis driven at 300 mA to provide the coil excitation signal. The\nconditioning electronics also performs the demodulation of\ncurrent signal and induced voltages from the detection coils\nwith respect to excitation waveform, producing in-phase and\nquadrature dc components. The data acquisition unit has three\ntasks: the switching of the excitation signal via reed relays to\neach coil sequentially, control over amplitude gain selection\nof 1, 56, 226, and 362 depending on the detection coil posi-\ntion relative to excitation coil, and converting the resolved dc\ncomponents to digital signals. The data acquisition software is\nrealized in Visual C++ making use of the Microsoft Foundation\nClass (MFC) library in conjunction with General Purpose Inter-\nface Bus (GPIB) and Virtual Instrument Software Architecture\n(VISA) library to facilitate nine-channel data loggings (excita-\ntion current and eight detection voltages). A Pentium-based PC\ncomputer operating the online acquisition software takes the\nreadings via a GPIB link and stores the data in formats suitable\nfor retrieval by software packages such as MATLAB for further\nimaging processing. The system has a frame acquisition rate of\napproximately 1.35 s.\nIn order to select the optimum excitation frequency, the pen-\netration effect of eddy currents into the pouring nozzle, which\nis typically graphite-alumina, must be considered. The elec-\ntrical conductivity of graphite is kS\/m compared to\nMS\/m for steel at room temperature and kS\/m\nfor molten steel at 1500 C. The penetration of eddy currents\ninto the pouring nozzle is frequency dependent. It was found\nthat the nozzle attenuated the eddy-current signal at frequen-\ncies above 10 kHz. To avoid significant eddy-current losses in\nthe nozzle walls, its operating frequency should be limited to\nbelow 10 kHz. Therefore, 5 kHz was selected as the operating\nFig. 3. Photograph of the physical sensor and nozzle model.\nfrequency at which the skin depth was 26.9 mm for graphite so\nthat the nozzle had a negligible effect compared to the nozzle\nwall thickness (17 mm). In the meantime, the skin depth for\nmolten steel at 1500 C was 8.0 mm, which was comparable\nwith object space size to ensure that a sufficient volume of steel\nwas probed.\nThe main sensor array components are eight coils, which\nwere chosen as a compromise between system complexity and\nimage resolution. Each coil was wound with copper wire (50\nturns, 50-mm diameter each) and equally spaced at 45 intervals\naround the periphery of the SEN to preserve symmetry. Each\ncoil, together with its associated electronics, can be multiplexed\nbetween excitation and detection tasks as directed by the PC\ncomputer. At each projection, one coil is energized while the\nremaining seven coils act as detectors. The quadrature signals\nare measured as they provide larger voltages, hence improved\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Coils are energized in sequence to\nprovide a total of eight projections and hence 56 measurements.\nHowever, only 28 independent measurements are used for each\nframe image reconstruction due to sensor coil reciprocity.\nFig. 3 shows a photograph of the physical sensor and nozzle\nmodel. The nozzle has an inner diameter of 70 mm, which rep-\nresents the maximum area to be visualized. Naturally, the ma-\nterials for sensor array construction must be carefully selected\nto endure the high temperatures during hot tests. A machinable\nceramic material (Duratec 750) was used to construct the coil\nMA et al.: ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNIQUES FOR IMAGING CROSS-SECTION DISTRIBUTION 227\nFig. 4. Four measured primary sensitivity maps for a symmetrical eight-coil sensor array system, all dimensions in X and Y directions are in millimeters.\n(a) Sensitivity map for excitation coil 1 and detection coil 2.

(d) Sensitivity map for excitation coil 1 and detection coil 5.\nformers, array base, and enclosure as shown in Fig. 3, which\noperated at 1000 C. Silicone sealant was utilized to bond the\nsensor array as it also had a high temperature rating (300 C).\nAfter assembly, the coils were boxed with a central area empty\nto accommodate the nozzle. An air supply was applied to the en-\nclosure passing through the coils for cooling; the internal tem-\nperature was monitored.\nB. Sensitivity Maps\nThe sensitivity maps, which are dependent on the material\ndistribution in the sensor array, show spatial sensitivity of a par-\nticular excitation-detection coil combination to pixel perturba-\ntions within the object space. Sensitivity maps are widely used\nto solve the inverse problems in image reconstruction, as they\ndescribe the unique conductivity distribution to pixel perturba-\ntions for the given sensor array. These maps can be calculated\nby either analytical approximation [20], numerical approaches,\nor by experimental measurements. In this case, sensitivity maps\nwere produced using direct measurements and compared with\nFEM simulations.\nIn the experimental measurements, a copper rod (\nMS\/m) of 12.5-mm diameter was used to represent the pixel\nperturbation. The rod was placed and moved upon a 10-mm\ngrid inside the nozzle model. A square area of 49 pixels, a\n7 7 matrix, was therefore required to describe the nozzle\u2019s\n70-mm diameter circular space; this required 37 individual\nrod positions. Only perturbations with respect to empty space\nwere considered. The response to empty space, under identical\nexcitation conditions, was subtracted from the outputs of a\ndetector coil when the target rod was present, i.e., (1) becoming\n; thus, only net effects caused by the target object\nwere recorded. To minimize the unwanted interference effects,\nnine scans were taken upon the detection coil voltage for each\nperturbation for averaging purposes. Impedance changes were\ncalculated by dividing the averaged voltage changes and the\nassociated current readings.\nIn image reconstruction, it is normally necessary to calcu-\nlate the primary sensitivity maps due to sensor array symmetry,\nand all of the other maps can be derived from these by rota-\ntional transformations. Fig. 4 shows four primary maps for the\neight-coil sensor array, which represent the changes in the imag-\ninary component of the mutual impedance of each coil pair. The\ninitial maps have 37 pixels; hence, the maps have been smoothed\nand interpolated for adequate presentation. This process consists\nof a square 7 7 matrix generation from the initial 37 pixels\nby placing corner pixels via simple averaging of the nearest\npixels, followed by both and direction interpolations onto\na 200 200 pixel grid using cubic spline operations. A circular\nmap is finally constructed using 31 415 pixels of the available\n200 200 pixels. The smoothness in the shape of the maps illus-\ntrates the minimal effect of noise upon the system. As expected,\nfor opposite coils (1 and 5, refer to Fig. 3 for coil positions), a\ndistinctive saddle shape is observable. The map shapes of other\ncoil pairs (1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4; see Fig. 3) show that the\nincrease in the magnetic field coupling is apparent when the per-\nturbation approaches the coils.\nFor the comparison, the sensor array, as shown in Fig. 3,\nwas simulated using Maxwell (Ansoft Corporation), which is\n228 IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, VOL. 5, NO. 2, APRIL 2005\nFig. 5. Simulation sensitivity maps of coil pairs when coil 1 is excited using Maxwell (Ansoft Corporation). All dimensions in X and Y directions are in\nmillimeters. (a) Neighboring coil pairs 1 and 2 and (b) opposite coil pairs 1 and 5.\na three-dimensional (3-D) finite element package, to create the\nsimulated sensitivity maps. This simulation software offered a\npiecewise solution to field problems by splitting the problem\ninto a series of small tetrahedral elements over which the field\nvalues are approximated. A problem region was solved of five\ntimes the size of the sensor model to ensure that the applied\nboundary conditions did not over constrain the solution. The sur-\nrounding air was assigned by the material property of a vacuum.\nA total of 21 558 tetrahedral elements were meshed to ensure\nthat the simulations converged to 0.5% error.\nAs with the experimental method, a 12.5-mm diameter\ncopper rod was used as the target object and moved upon a\n10-mm grid inside the nozzle. At each rod position, the coils\nwere excited with a 5-kHz 300-mA sinusoidal current; Maxwell\ncalculated the induced voltages on the sensing coils under each\nexcitation both with and without a perturbation object inside,\nrespectively. The time expense required for computing a full\ncollection of 56 maps on a Pentium PC (2.20 GHz CPU, 2.0\nGB RAM) was approximately 81 h. This meant that an average\ntime of approximately 90 min was taken for one sensitivity\nmap calculation, which was much longer than the experiment\nmethod.\nFig. 5 shows the simulated sensitivity maps, as the examples,\nbetween neighboring coil-pair (coil 1\u20132) and opposite coil-pair\n(coil 1\u20135). The shape similarity between the simulated and ex-\nperimental maps can be measured in terms of cross-correlation\ncoefficients. Unrelated maps result in a correlation coefficient\nof zero, whereas equivalent maps have a correlation coefficient\nof one. The correlation coefficients between Figs. 4(a) and 5(a)\nand Figs.4(d) and 5(b) are 0.8526 and 0.8105, respectively. In\naddition, the normalized dot division of the simulated and exper-\nimental maps shows that all the dot values are between 0.5 and\n1.0. All of these indicate that the simulated and experimental\nmaps for the same coil pair are in good agreement. The differ-\nences are mainly due to the significant approximations made\nin the simulation, for example, a single stranded turn for coils\nin the simulation system rather than 50 turns for coils in the\nreal system, and the gain control, which is normally used in\nthe instrument system for the induced voltage amplification de-\npending on the coil pair position relative to the nozzle.\nThe final sensitivity matrix represents an amalgamation of a\nseries of the sensitivity maps and has dimensions of 28 49,\nwhere 28 represents elements in matrix and 49 denotes\nelements in matrix . An experimental sensitivity matrix was\nemployed during image reconstruction.\nC. Image Reconstruction\nThe SIRT reconstruction algorithm involves an iterative\nprocess to solve the equation as described in (1) for when\nand are known. The iterative algorithm at step is described\nby\n(2)\nwhere represents the backward projection matrix and is the\nrelaxation factor that controls the convergence speed of the algo-\nrithm. Matrix could use heavily regularized inverse matrices,\nfor example, based on truncated singular value decomposition\n(SVD) [18]. However, in this case, a normalized transposition\nof is used, namely ( ), as it is\na simplistic method for converting measurements into images.\nAn initial guess is made for . As only conductive media\nis present, nonnegative constraining is used to limit the value\nof each pixel to lie between zero and one, where the maximum\nvalue of one corresponds to a full element and values between\nzero and one to partially filled elements [15].\nCold samples were initially employed to determine the ability\nof the system and reconstruction algorithm in distinguishing be-\ntween differing areas of conductivity. Titanium rods (electrical\nconductivity MS\/m) were used as test phantoms for\nreal problem imitation. Three titanium rods with known sizes\nof 19-, 25-, and 35-mm diameters were placed at different po-\nsitions within the nozzle. Fig. 6 shows the responses in time\nsequence of coil 5 acting as a detector under excitation of coil\n1, as an example, to three rods at different positions. It is evi-\ndent that a larger rod causes larger signal changes in the induced\nvoltage due to larger eddy-current losses. For a given phantom,\nthe smallest signal change is found at the center position; this is\nin agreement with previously presented sensitivity maps. A dif-\nference in signal between positions 1 and 3 for the largest rod is\npossible due to misalignment during these tests.\nFig. 7 shows images of three rods placed in different posi-\ntions in the pouring nozzle by utilizing the measured coil out-\nputs in conjunction with the SIRT algorithm, where and the\nMA et al.: ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNIQUES FOR IMAGING CROSS-SECTION DISTRIBUTION 229\nFig. 6. Coil outputs in time sequence for small (19-mm diameter), medium\n(25-mm diameter), and large (38-mm diameter) rods placed at three different\npositions within the nozzle. Larger rod causes larger signal changes of the\ninduced voltage due to larger eddy-current losses, and central position suffers\nfrom the least spatial resolution.\nnumber of iterations are 0.01 and 2000, respectively, which are\nthe case dependent. From these images, there is good accuracy\nbetween real and estimate rod positions. The relative sample\nsize can be inferred by comparing the pixel value differences\nof the three rods. As a further example, Fig. 8 shows an image\nof three copper rods (two 19-mm-diameter rods and one small\n12.5-mm-diameter rod) placed within the nozzle. The inference\nof the sample size becomes difficult as the magnetic field cou-\npling between rods complicates the problem more than in the\nsingle-rod case. However, the position predictions are in good\nagreement with the real positions.\nIV. HOT PLANT TRIAL RESULTS\nHot casting trials were undertaken using the heavy pilot\nplant facilities at Corus Teesside Technology Centre. The trial\narrangement is shown in Fig. 9. The sensor array was placed\naround a transparent quartz glass tube, which was positioned\noff center (top right), within a standard slab caster SEN and\nconnected to the EMT instrument through long thermally\nshielded cables, which suffered no degradation of signal over\nthe required 7 m. Molten steel was supplied from a 4-ton\nnominal capacity electric arc furnace via a stoppered ladle to\na tundish and then passed to a pseudo-casting mold via the\nglass tube to enable submerged pouring to be simulated. Two\nscans were taken for averaging purposes, which resulted in\na sampling rate of 2.70 s\/frame. Casting was maintained for\napproximately 220 s. During data loggings, flow patterns were\nalso observed and recorded using video.\nFig. 10 shows the sensor outputs throughout casting for the\ncases of a neighboring coil-pair (coil 1\u20132) and an opposite\ncoil-pair (coil 1\u20135). The short step changes of the detected\nsignal are the indicators of casting commencing and casting\nstopping during pouring. Two breaks in casting are observed in\nthe illustration, which were manually established by controlling\nFig. 7. Images of small (19-mm diameter), medium (25-mm diameter), and\nlarge (38-mm diameter) titanium rods: (a) small rod at (0,0), (b) medium rod at\n(\u000020,0), and (c) large rod at (20,0).\nthe stopper rod. Thermal drift is apparent in the detected signal\ncompared with the coil response to cold samples as shown in\nFig. 6; this is possibly caused by the combination of drift of the\nsensing electronics and thermal variations in the EM properties\nof the support materials. The resultant signal appears as if a\nthermal-free signal is superimposed on a background signal,\nwhich changes exponentially with casting time. This back-\nground signal is thereby numerically fitted with an exponential\ncurve and then subtracted from the original detected signal to\n230 IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, VOL. 5, NO. 2, APRIL 2005\nFig. 8. Images of two copper rods (19-mm diameter at (\u000020, 10) and (10,\n\u000010), respectively) and one small copper rod [12.5-mm diameter at (20, 10)]\nwhen placed within nozzle simultaneously.\nFig. 9. Hot casting trials using the pilot plant facilities at Corus Teesside\nTechnology Centre.\nachieve a thermal-free signal. All sensor outputs are treated\naccordingly to remove thermal effects.\nThe thermally compensated outputs are arranged in a matrix\nsuch that the rows represent the time sequence, i.e., image frame\nindex, and the columns the coil-pair measurements respectively.\nImages of steel flow profiles are then produced by utilization\nof the reconstruction algorithm with iterations\nand nonnegative constraining. More iterations are used due to a\nreduction in the SNR of hot trial signals. A selection of results\nis shown in Fig. 11. The images are shown in sequence from left\nto right and then top to bottom with a common gray scale. All\nimages adequately predict the position, i.e., the upper right side\nof the SEN. The two breaks in the pour at approximately 65 and\n140 s are clearly visible. The changes of steel flow profiles can\nFig. 10. Display of the detected signals during hot trial and thermal drift effect\nremoval: (a) coil 2 excited by coil 1 and (b) coil 5 excited by coil 1.\nbe differentiated in terms of the variation in grey level which\nlies at the right of each image.\nIt is evident that these images provide a good representation\nof the steel flow profile changes through the SEN during casting.\nThe results were consistent with video recording of an exposed\nsection of the steel flow. Consequentially, the hot trial results\ndemonstrate that the electromagnetic sensing technique can be\nused to monitor and visualize the real molten steel flow through\na pouring nozzle.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe paper has presented an EMT system, which is composed\nof an eight-coil sensor array, a data acquisition unit, the asso-\nciated conditioning circuitry, and a PC-based computer. The\nsystem has been purposely designed and constructed for hot\nplant trials. A suitable excitation frequency is selected for the\nMA et al.: ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNIQUES FOR IMAGING CROSS-SECTION DISTRIBUTION 231\nFig. 11.

Images from the cold sample tests show that\nthe object position can be discriminated and the inference of\nthe relative object size is possible. The promising results from\nthe preliminary pilot plant trials demonstrate that the EMT ap-\nproach can be utilized to monitor and visualize real molten steel\nflow through a pouring nozzle.\nThe present system uses a simple reconstruction algorithm for\nimage reconstruction and has a low data acquisition rate (1.35 s\nper frame). An improved EMT system is under development to\nincrease acquisition speed, decrease system size, improve reso-\nlution, and present the images in real time. An improved recon-\nstruction algorithm, based on nonlinear regularised techniques,\nsuch as Gauss\u2013Newton methods, is also being formulated for\nhot trial measurement data. Also, as single frequency excitation\nhas been shown to inadequately resolve complex flow regimes,\na multifrequency measurement approach and a subsequent in-\nversion algorithm is required to offer a solution capable of vi-\nsualizing complex annular and bubbly flows within the nozzle.\nNevertheless, it is believed that the EMT application holds sig-\nnificant promise for the future industrial process.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank M.
