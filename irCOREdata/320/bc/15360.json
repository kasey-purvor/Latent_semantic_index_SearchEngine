In the deeper reservoirs, gas is trapped hydrodynamically by high lateral 9 \noverpressure gradients. We have analysed overpressure and compaction in this field by using 10 \nwireline log, pressure, temperature, and vitrinite reflectance data. The top of overpressure is 11 \nlocated below 3 km burial depth, below the depth range for transformation of discrete 12 \nsmectite to mixed-layer illite\/smectite. Density-sonic and density-resistivity crossplots for 13 \nmudrocks show reversals within the transition zone into hard overpressure below 3.5 km 14 \ndepth. Vitrinite reflectance measurements indicate that the start of unloading coincides with 15 \nthe onset of gas generation. Moreover, mudrock density continues to increase with depth in 16 \nthe overpressured section to values above 2.6 g cm-3. We conclude that gas generation and 17 \nchemical compaction are responsible for overpressure generation, contradicting previous 18 \ninterpretations that disequilibrium compaction is the principal mechanism for generating 19 \noverpressure in the Lower Kutai Basin. The particular circumstances which make our radical 20 \ninterpretation plausible are that it is a warm basin with lateral reservoir drainage, so the 21 \noverpressured mudrocks are probably overcompacted as a result of diagenesis. 22 \n 23 \nKEYWORDS: Lower Kutai Basin, overpressure, unloading, gas generation, compaction  24 \n25 \n 2\nIntroduction 26 \nOverpressure in Cenozoic basins is commonly associated with the inability of fluid to escape 27 \nrapidly enough to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium during ongoing burial. As a consequence, 28 \nthe sediments retain higher porosities than they would do if the pore pressure were 29 \nhydrostatic. This process is referred to as disequilibrium compaction (Swarbrick et al. 2002). 30 \nDisequilibrium compaction was recognized as a primary mechanism for generating 31 \noverpressure in the US Gulf Coast region over 40 years ago (Pennebaker 1968; Reynolds 32 \n1970). Since then, disequilibrium compaction has been diagnosed as the cause of overpressure 33 \nin many sedimentary basins worldwide, including the Neogene prodelta mudrocks of the 34 \nBaram Delta, Brunei (Tingay et al. 2009).  35 \n 36 \n More recent work in overpressure analysis has shown the importance of other 37 \noverpressure generating mechanisms apart from disequilibrium compaction, even in Neogene 38 \nsequences. These overpressure generating mechanisms, such as gas generation, clay 39 \ndiagenesis, aquathermal pressuring and pressure transference, can be classified as unloading 40 \nmechanisms (Bowers 1995). Some examples of basins where these mechanisms have been 41 \nshown to be active are Haltenbanken and the Northern North Sea (Hermanrud et al. 1998; 42 \nTeige et al. 1999, 2007), the Eugene Island area of the Gulf of Mexico (Bowers 2001), and 43 \nthe inner shelf sequence of the Baram Delta (Tingay et al. 2009). 44 \n 45 \n The Peciko Field is located within Miocene strata in the Lower Kutai Basin, 46 \nKalimantan, Indonesia (Fig. 1). A transition zone into hard overpressure is encountered in the 47 \nfield at depths of 11,000\u201314,000 ft (3350\u20134250 m). The primary mechanism responsible for 48 \noverpressure generation in this area has previously been interpreted to be disequilibrium 49 \ncompaction (Bois et al. 1994; Bates 1996; Burrus 1998).  50 \n 3\n 51 \n The principal objective of the work reported here was to determine whether 52 \ndisequilibrium compaction really is the mechanism responsible for generating overpressure in 53 \nthe Peciko Field. A secondary aim was to find a method which can be used during drilling 54 \nmudrock sections to estimate overpressure for wider application in the basin. By analysing 55 \nwireline log data in the mud-rich intervals, we show that overpressure is generated by 56 \nunloading mechanisms, probably including both gas generation and clay mineral diagenesis, 57 \nand not disequilibrium compaction. Our interpretation is radically different from that of 58 \nprevious workers, who have all concluded that the principal mechanism for generating 59 \noverpressure was disequilibrium compaction. 60 \n 61 \n In the following sections, we give background on the geology of the basin, 62 \noverpressure distribution, and wireline log responses to overpressure before presenting our 63 \nanalysis of log, pressure, temperature, and vitrinite reflectance data. We then discuss the 64 \nimplications for overpressure generation mechanisms and, in reaching our conclusions, 65 \ncomment on the particular circumstances in the Lower Kutai Basin which make it a rewarding 66 \nbasin to study for understanding overpressure generation and chemical compaction in mud-67 \nrich sedimentary successions. 68 \n 69 \nGeological background and overpressure distribution 70 \nTectonically, the Lower Kutai Basin has experienced several episodes of rift, sag, and 71 \ninversion resulting from interaction between the Eurasia plate to the north, the Pacific Plate to 72 \nthe east, and the Australian Plate to the south (Moss & Chambers 1999). The main inversion 73 \nepisodes have occurred from the Middle Miocene to the present, and have been responsible 74 \nfor the development of anticlinal structures (Chambers et al. 2004). The major structural 75 \n 4\nfeature is the Samarinda Anticlinorium, consisting of a series of anticlines and synclines with 76 \naxes oriented approximately north\u2013south. This anticlinorium is highly folded and faulted on 77 \nthe onshore area, whereas dips are gentle in the shallow water and deep offshore areas. The 78 \nmain north\u2013south anticlinal folds are the Onshore Axis, Internal Axis, Median Axis, External 79 \nAxis, and Offshore Axis (Fig. 1). The Peciko Field is located on the Median Axis. 80 \n 81 \n According to Allen & Chambers (1998), the thickness of the Neogene section in the 82 \nbasin, which comprises deltaic sediment sourced by the Mahakam River in eastern 83 \nKalimantan, may reach about 14 km in the depocentre. The Mahakam Delta is a fluvial-tidal 84 \nmud-dominated delta that has been prograding from the Early Miocene to the present day. 85 \nStratigraphically, the productive interval in the Middle\u2013Upper Miocene succession is the 86 \nTunu Main Zone, and the hydrocarbons present are mainly gas. The Tunu Main Zone is sub-87 \ndivided into six intermediate stratigraphic units, of which only the uppermost five are present 88 \nin the Peciko Field. They have an average thickness of 300\u2013400 m, based on the presence of 89 \nthird-order maximum flooding surfaces. The intermediate stratigraphic units are further sub-90 \ndivided into several smaller stratigraphic units, based on the presence of local flooding 91 \nsurfaces. The reservoirs in this field are dominantly distributary mouth bars (Samson et al., 92 \n2005). The dimensions of individual mouth bars are 1\u20133 m thick and 1500\u20134000 m wide, and 93 \nstacked mouth bars attain thicknesses of 10\u201330 m (Fig. 2a). Figure 2b is a schematic cross-94 \nsection of the field which illustrates the stacked nature of the gas reservoirs and the tilted gas-95 \nwater contacts in the deeper overpressured accumulations. 96 \n 97 \nThe burial history of the Tunu Main Zone in this field (Fig. 3) shows that the 98 \nsedimentation rate during the last 8 My has been fairly constant at around 300 m My-1. This 99 \nongoing deposition of fine-grained sediment has previously been interpreted as being 100 \n 5\nresponsible for the generation of overpressure by disequilibrium compaction in this area (Bois 101 \net al. 1994; Bates 1996; Burrus 1998). 102 \n 103 \n The inversion episodes have caused almost all of the Neogene sedimentary layers to 104 \ncrop out in the onshore and coastal areas. Consequently, overpressure can bleed off laterally 105 \non the basin scale, depending on the degree of reservoir connectivity. This process is known 106 \nas lateral reservoir drainage (O\u2019Connor & Swarbrick 2008). The occurrence of lateral 107 \nreservoir drainage in the Peciko Field was identified by Grosjean et al. (1994) and Lambert et 108 \nal. (2003). The lateral overpressure gradients are sufficiently large to create hydrodynamic 109 \ntraps for gas. For example, in stratigraphic unit 3 the lateral overpressure gradient reaches 150 110 \npsi km-1 (Fig. 4a). Given a gas density of 0.2 g cm-3, the gas-water contact has a tilt of up to 111 \n7\u00b0. There is ample field evidence of tilted accumulations of gas in the deeper reservoir 112 \nintervals of the Peciko Field.  In these reservoirs, the gas accumulations are displaced down-113 \ndip on to the northern flank of the structure, as shown schematically in Fig. 2b, and the gas 114 \ncolumn in crestal wells is either very thin or absent (Fig. 4b). A south\u2013north cross-section 115 \n(Fig. 5) shows that both top of overpressure and the top of the pressure transition zone deepen 116 \nto the north, where the strata are more sand-rich.   117 \n 118 \n Information about source rocks in the Lower Kutai Basin generally, and in the Peciko 119 \nField specifically, has been provided by Oudin & Picard (1982), Schoell et al. (1985), Burrus 120 \net al. (1992), Paterson et al. (1997), Duval et al. (1998), and Lambert et al. (2003). The main 121 \nsource rocks in the area are organic-rich mudrocks, coal beds, and even sandy facies 122 \ndeposited in fluvial, deltaic top, tidal plain, and delta front settings. They are mostly classified 123 \nas Type III source rocks. Although the organic-rich mudrocks are gas prone, Lambert et al. 124 \n(2003) reported that the oil-generative potential of the Type III organic matter is unusually 125 \n 6\nhigh. The contribution to hydrocarbon generation from marine mudrocks, located in the 126 \ndeepwater Makassar Straits and in the deeper part of fields surrounding Mahakam Delta, is 127 \nthought to be negligible because their organic content is low. Interestingly, isotopic analysis 128 \nperformed by Lambert et al. (2003) showed that the threshold for both gas and oil maturation 129 \ncorresponds to a vitrinite reflectance of 0.6%.  130 \n 131 \nWireline log responses to overpressure 132 \nThere are several candidate mechanisms for generating overpressure in the Lower Kutai 133 \nBasin, including disequilibrium compaction, clay diagenesis, gas generation, and lateral 134 \npressure transfer. Wireline log analysis can help to distinguish between these mechanisms 135 \n(e.g. Bowers 2001; Katahara 2006).  136 \n 137 \n When a mud-rich sedimentary succession cannot dewater rapidly enough for the pore 138 \npressure to remain hydrostatic during burial, its porosity is greater than that it would be if the 139 \npore pressure were hydrostatic, and the overpressure is said to be caused by disequilibrium 140 \ncompaction. Where overpressure has been generated by disequilibrium compaction in a 141 \nuniform mudrock succession, with virtually no loss of pore fluid, the porosity remains 142 \nconstant and the pore pressure-depth profile becomes parallel to the vertical stress-depth 143 \nprofile. 144 \n 145 \n Where overpressure has been generated by an unloading mechanism such as clay 146 \ndiagenesis, gas generation or lateral transfer, the pore pressure can increase more rapidly with 147 \ndepth than the vertical stress (Fig. 6). In such circumstances, the density usually continues to 148 \nincrease with depth through the overpressured mudrocks, while the sonic log trend reverses, 149 \nmoving towards higher sonic travel time with increasing depth. The resistivity log trend also 150 \n 7\nreverses, moving towards lower resistivity with increasing depth. These responses can be 151 \nexplained by the concept of storage pores and connecting pores (Bowers & Katsube 2002). 152 \nWhen pore pressure in a mudrock increases due to fluid expansion, the unloading response is 153 \nessentially elastic and results in only a very small increase in porosity. Because the density 154 \nlog measures the bulk porosity of the mudrock, it is barely affected by the fluid expansion. 155 \nThe increase in porosity that does occur during fluid expansion is predominately due to the 156 \nopening of flat connecting pores, because they are more compliant than the storage pores. The 157 \nsonic and resistivity log responses are sensitive to the opening of connecting pores because 158 \ntheir opening reduces the bulk modulus and rigidity and increases the conductivity.  159 \n 160 \nData analysis 161 \nThe Peciko Field was developed using the concept of hydrodynamic trapping (Grosjean et al. 162 \n1994; Lambert et al. 2003), and a campaign of reservoir pressure measurements for 163 \nhydrodynamic analysis purposes has resulted in an excellent pressure database. On average, 164 \nthere are around 70 RFT points in each well. These pressure data are very useful for 165 \noverpressure analysis because they can be used both to determine overpressure distribution 166 \nand to calibrate methods of pore pressure estimation. 167 \n 168 \n We have analysed data from the discovery well, PEC-1, and 16 appraisal wells in the 169 \nPeciko Field, most of which have terminated at the pressure transition zone into hard 170 \noverpressure. Here, we present data from three wells, PEC-1, NWP-9, and NWP-16 (Fig. 2a), 171 \nto illustrate our findings. PEC-1 was chosen as a typical example of a well on the crest of the 172 \nstructure and because source rock maturation data are available from it, although it does 173 \ncontain a relatively small number of RFT points and no density log was run in this early well. 174 \nNWP-9 was chosen because it encounters the highest overpressure value in the Peciko Field 175 \n 8\nand shows a clear unloading response on density-sonic and density-resistivity crossplots. 176 \nNWP-16 is located downflank in the northern part of the field where the top of overpressure is 177 \ndeeper and the geothermal gradient is slightly lower (Fig. 3). It is the deepest well in the field 178 \nand was chosen to make a comparison of the wireline log responses with those from well 179 \nNWP-9. 180 \n 181 \nPrior to analysing the wireline response to overpressure, it is necessary to discriminate 182 \nmud-rich intervals from more silty and sandy intervals from the given set of wireline logs. 183 \nDiscrimination was done by cross-plotting density against the difference between neutron 184 \nporosity and the porosity estimated from the density logs (Fig. 7), as done by Katahara 185 \n(2006). To infer porosity from the density log, a matrix density of 2.75 g cm-3 and a fluid 186 \ndensity of 1.05 g cm-3 were arbitrarily assumed. An arbitrary threshold value of 0.18 was 187 \nchosen (i.e., NPHI \u2013 DPHI > 0.18) to ensure that our pressure analysis was consistently 188 \nperformed in the mud-rich intervals, although tests showed that estimated pore pressures in 189 \nthe mudrocks had low sensitivity to the choice of threshold value. 190 \n 191 \n The pressure-depth plot for well PEC-1 (Fig. 8a) is typical of wells in this field, except 192 \nthat the top of overpressure is located at slightly greater depths further north (Fig. 3). The 193 \noverpressure initially increases slowly with depth below the top of overpressure at ~9500 ft 194 \n(~2900 m) and then more rapidly through a transition zone into hard overpressure. The top of 195 \nthe transition zone is at ~11,300 ft (~3450 m). The top of transition zone is picked at the depth 196 \nwhere vertical effective stress starts to decrease as depth increases. 197 \n 198 \n According to Lambert et al. (2003), the maturity threshold for gas generation 199 \ncorresponds to a vitrinite reflectance value of 0.6%.  Well PEC-1 is the only well in the 200 \n 9\nPeciko Field from which vitrinite reflectance data are available (Fig. 8b). There is a 201 \ncorrelation between the top of the transition zone into hard overpressure and the vitrinite 202 \nreflectance value of 0.6%. Four data points in the interval 10,000\u201312,000 ft (3050\u20133650 m) 203 \nhave vitrinite reflectance values below the general trend. There is no other available 204 \ninformation to indicate whether they are reliable, but there is a possibility that these values 205 \nwere obtained from fragments due to caving, and not cuttings from the drill bit. 206 \n 207 \n The pressure-depth plot for well NWP-9 (Fig. 9) indicates that the top of overpressure 208 \nis at a depth of ~11,000 ft (~3350 m), although there is a good RFT measurement showing 209 \n~300 psi (~2 MPa) of overpressure in an isolated sand body at ~10,000 ft (~3050 m) depth. 210 \nThe top of the transition into hard overpressure is around 12,000 ft (3650 m) depth, where 211 \nreversals can be seen in the trends of both the sonic and resistivity logs through the mudrocks.  212 \nThe density log, by contrast, shows no obvious reversal, but it shows consistently high values 213 \nof density, around 2.6 g cm-3, in the depth interval 11,000\u201313,000 ft (3350\u20133950 m).  214 \n 215 \n The pressure-depth plot for well NWP-16 (Fig. 10) appears to converge slightly 216 \ntowards the lithostatic gradient with increasing depth, but it is not clear whether the well has 217 \nentered the expected transition zone into hard overpressure. The wireline logs appear to 218 \ndisplay asymptotic trends towards the bottom of the well, without any clear indication of 219 \nreversals, although it is possible that the trends of both sonic and resistivity logs are on the 220 \npoint of reversing at the bottom of the well.  221 \n 222 \n Crossplots of density against sonic and resistivity log values for mudrocks in well 223 \nNWP-9 are shown in Fig. 11, with data points colour-coded at intervals of 1000 ft (305 m). 224 \nThe smectitic and illitic compaction trends, introduced by Dutta (2002) and adopted by 225 \n 10\nKatahara (2006), are shown on the density-sonic crossplot for reference. The smectitic 226 \ncompaction trend is followed by mudrocks with a high proportion of discrete smectite.  The 227 \nillitic compaction trend is followed by mudrocks in which all the discrete smectite has been 228 \ntransformed into mixed-layer illite\/smectite. Both crossplots show clear unloading responses 229 \nstarting at a depth of ~12,000 ft (~3650 m). The data points coloured red in the deepest 230 \ninterval show changes in trend, with increased sonic transit time and decreased resistivity but 231 \nno decrease in density. These observations provide clear evidence that the generating 232 \nmechanism for hard overpressure is an unloading process. Data points in the depth range 233 \n5000\u201312,000 ft (1500\u20133650 m) on the density-sonic crossplot fall on, or close to, the illitic 234 \ncompaction trend. The average geothermal gradient is around 0.0094 \u00b0C ft-1 (0.031\u00b0C m-1) 235 \nwith a surface temperature of 30\u00b0C, giving an estimated temperature of nearly 80\u00b0C at 5000 ft 236 \n(1500 m) depth, sufficient for discrete smectite to have disappeared (Hower et al. 1976; Boles 237 \n& Franks 1979). 238 \n 239 \n Clauer et al. (1999) investigated clay mineralogy in the Tunu Field, which is located 240 \non the Median Axis north of Peciko (Fig. 1) so the clay mineralogy in the two fields may be 241 \nexpected to be similar. At sampling depths below 7700 ft (2350 m), they found that the clay 242 \nfraction consists of mixed-layer illite\/smectite, kaolinite\/dickite, detrital illite and chlorite. 243 \nThis clay mineral composition is consistent with the illitic compaction trend observed below 244 \n~5000 ft (~1500 m) (Fig. 11). The fact that the density-sonic crossplot follows an illitic 245 \ncompaction trend over the hydrostatically pressured depth interval of 5000\u201311,000 ft (1500\u2013246 \n3350 m) indicates that excess water which may have been released by the transformation of 247 \ndiscrete smectite to mixed-layer illite\/smectite has dissipated and does not contribute to 248 \npresent-day overpressures. However, clay diagenetic reactions that continue to be active at 249 \nhigher temperatures, including ongoing illitization of mixed-layer illite\/smectite and the 250 \n 11\nconversion of kaolinite to illite (Bj\u00f8rlykke 1998), and also quartz dissolution and precipitation 251 \n(Bj\u00f8rkum 1995), probably do contribute to present-day overpressures. 252 \n 253 \n Composite density plots for mudrocks in all 16 NWP wells (Fig. 4a) are shown in Fig. 254 \n12, without and with the data points from the overpressured intervals in each well. The 255 \ndensity continues to increase smoothly below the top of overpressure, even though the vertical 256 \neffective stress reaches its maximum value at the top of overpressure in each well. Thus, 257 \ncompaction appears to continue with increasing depth, independent of the vertical effective 258 \nstress. This plot constitutes strong evidence for ongoing chemical compaction below the top 259 \nof overpressure, and for discounting disequilibrium compaction as a mechanism that 260 \ncontributes to the generation of overpressure in this field. Given the high average density, in 261 \nexcess of 2.6 g cm-3 below 12,000 ft in all wells (Fig. 12), our preferred interpretation is that 262 \nthe mudrocks in the overpressured intervals have become overcompacted by diagenetic 263 \nprocesses, i.e. overcompacted in a mechanical sense due to the chemical compaction 264 \nprocesses.  265 \n 266 \nImplications for overpressure generation 267 \nPressure-depth plots show that the top of overpressure is at depths of 9500\u201312,000 ft (2900\u2013268 \n3650 m), corresponding to estimated temperatures of 120\u2013140\u00b0C, and that there is a transition 269 \nzone into hard overpressure at depths of 11,500\u201314,000 ft (3500\u20134250 m), corresponding to 270 \nestimated temperatures of 140\u2013160\u00b0C. These depths to the top of overpressure are relatively 271 \nlarge in comparison to other Neogene basins worldwide, as summarized by Swarbrick et al. 272 \n(2002). For example, in the Malay Basin where the sedimentation rate is around 800 ft My-1 273 \n(240 m My-1), about 20% less than the sedimentation rate over the last 8 My in the Lower 274 \nKutai Basin, the top of overpressure is around 3200 ft (975 m) depth. Presumably, the top of 275 \n 12\noverpressure in the Lower Kutai Basin is so deep because of lateral reservoir drainage 276 \n(Grosjean et al. 1994; Lambert et al. 2003). Inversion started in Middle Miocene times and 277 \nhas continued to the present day with uplift centred on the onshore area (Chambers et al. 278 \n2004). Unpublished net-to-gross (NTG) maps for the Median Axis region of the Lower Kutai 279 \nBasin show a progressive upward increase in NTG at the Peciko Field from stratigraphic unit 280 \n5 up to stratigraphic unit 3 (Figs 2b and 5), which is consistent with effective lateral drainage 281 \nabove the overpressured zone. 282 \n 283 \n Within the transition zone into hard overpressure in well NWP-9, both density-sonic 284 \nand density-resistivity crossplots show clear unloading responses (Figs 9 and 11). Clay 285 \ndiagenesis may contribute to the present-day overpressure in the Peciko Field. In the 286 \nhydrostatically pressured succession, data on the density-sonic crossplots lie on the illite-rich 287 \ncompaction trend below ~5000 ft (~1500 m), and remain on this trend in the zone of low 288 \noverpressure (Fig. 10). Although discrete smectite is likely to have disappeared by 5000 ft 289 \n(1500 m) burial depth, where the temperature approaches 80\u00b0C, illitization of mixed-layer 290 \nillite\/smectite is ongoing at greater depths to much higher temperatures (Hower et al. 1976; 291 \nBoles & Franks 1979). Kaolinite transforms to illite at temperatures ~130\u2013140\u00b0C in basin 292 \nsettings (Bj\u00f8rlykke 1998) and can contribute to overpressure both through the release of free 293 \nwater by the reaction and by transferring load from the grains to the pore fluid as mineral 294 \ngrains are dissolved (Bj\u00f8rlykke & Hoeg 1997). This temperature range roughly corresponds 295 \nto that estimated at the depth of the transition zone into high overpressure. Furthermore, the 296 \ndissolution of kaolinite and precipitation of illite may reduce porosity and permeability at this 297 \ndepth, and thereby help to maintain high overpressure in the deeper strata.  298 \n 299 \n 13\n Gas generation seems likely to be another unloading process responsible for the hard 300 \noverpressure, generated both directly from kerogen and from oil cracking to gas. According to 301 \nLambert et al. (2003), gas generation starts at a vitrinite reflectance of 0.6%. We have one set 302 \nof vitrinite reflectance data in the Peciko Field, i.e. in PEC-1 where there is a correlation 303 \nbetween high overpressure and vitrinite reflectance values above 0.6% (Fig. 7). Oudin & 304 \nPicard (1982) found that there is a good correlation between the top of hard overpressure and 305 \nthe increase in vitrinite reflectance in the Handil Field (Fig. 13), and Bates (1996) found a 306 \nsimilar correlation in the Nilam Field (Fig. 14). However, they did not draw any conclusions 307 \nabout overpressure generation mechanisms from the vitrinite reflectance data. We note that 308 \nthe data in each of those two wells show a strong correlation between the depth of transition 309 \ninto hard overpressure and the onset of gas generation, assuming that the threshold for gas 310 \ngeneration corresponds to a vitrinite reflectance of 0.6%. 311 \n 312 \n To the south and east of the Peciko Field, the sands within the Tunu Main Zone peter 313 \nout as the depositional environment changes from the shelf break setting to deep marine. 314 \nSince the organic carbon content of the deep marine sediment is low and its potential for 315 \nhydrocarbon generation is negligible, there is unlikely to be significant lateral transfer of 316 \noverpressure generated by gas generation in the synclinal area to the southeast, but there may 317 \nbe lateral transfer of overpressure generated by diagenetic reactions.  318 \n 319 \n In all wells with density logs, NWP-1 to NWP-16, the logged density values continue 320 \ngradually to increase downwards through the zone of low overpressure (Fig. 12), which is 321 \nconsistent with ongoing chemical compaction. The top of overpressure is located deep within 322 \nthe chemical compaction zone, where the effective stress appears to have no influence on 323 \ncompaction and the mudrocks are likely to be stiffened by chemical compaction so that they 324 \n 14\nare overconsolidated (Bj\u00f8rlykke & Hoeg 1997; Bj\u00f8rlykke 1998, 1999). Consequently, we 325 \nattribute the origin of the low overpressures, above the transition zone into hard overpressure, 326 \nto passive transmission of pore fluid from the highly overpressured zone below.   327 \n 328 \nConclusions 329 \nHard overpressure in the Peciko Field is generated by unloading mechanisms. The top of 330 \noverpressure is much deeper than the depth range where transformation of discrete smectite to 331 \nmixed-layer smectite\/illite occurs, so the disappearance of smectite does not contribute to the 332 \nobserved overpressure. The causes of the hard overpressure in the Peciko Field are likely to 333 \nbe gas generation, illitization of mixed-layer illite\/smectite, conversion of kaolinite to illite, 334 \nand dissolution and precipitation of quartz. We suggest that expulsion of fluid resulting from 335 \ngas generation and diagenesis in the zone of high overpressure maintains the hydrodynamic 336 \nflow through the reservoir layers containing gas accumulations. 337 \n 338 \nCompaction continues below the top of overpressure, independent of vertical effective 339 \nstress, in all 16 wells where density logs have been run. This observation is clear evidence of 340 \nongoing chemical compaction. The origin of the low overpressure above the transition zone 341 \ninto high overpressure is probably due to vertical transfer from below. The transition zone 342 \ninto hard overpressure can be recognized from sonic and resistivity log reversals, whether by 343 \ndirect inspection of the logs or by crossplotting their responses against the density log. 344 \n 345 \nThe high mudrock densities, greater than 2.6 g cm-3, at the top of overpressure indicate 346 \nthat the mudrocks are overcompacted. Therefore, our preferred interpretation is that 347 \ndisequilibrium compaction does not contribute to the overpressure. This conclusion is 348 \nradically new because all other studies of overpressured Neogene basins have suggested that 349 \n 15\ndisequilibrium compaction has contributed to the overpressure, either directly or indirectly by 350 \npressure transference. The particular circumstances in the Lower Kutai Basin which make our 351 \ninterpretation plausible are that it is a warm basin with lateral reservoir drainage. 352 \nConsequently, the top of overpressure is unusually deep for a mud-rich sequence that has 353 \nundergone rapid burial over the last 10 My.  354 \n 355 \nAcknowledgements 356 \nWe thank Total Indonesie for funding and data and Guillaume Smagghe for ongoing support 357 \nand a critical review.

Circle diameter is proportional to reservoir layer \nthickness in each well. Structural contour interval is 82 ft (25 m).   \nFigure 5. South\u2013north vertical section through the Peciko Field along the line marked in Fig. \n4a showing the general trend of overpressure with depth.\nFigure 6. Pressure-depth plot (right) with sonic and density log responses expected for a \nmudrock succession where overpressure is generated by an unloading process. Below the top \nof overpressure, the reversal in the trend of sonic transit time does not indicate abnormally \nhigh porosity because density continues to increase with depth. \nFigure 7. Crossplot of density against the difference between neutron and density porosities \nestimated from wireline logs in well NWP-9.  NPHI \u2013 DHPI = 0.18 was arbitrarily chosen as \nthe mudrock cut-off.   \nFigure 8. (a) Pressure-depth plot for well PEC-1. (b) Vitrinite reflectance data showing that \nthe threshold value of 0.6 % for gas generation, as determined by Lambert et al. (2003), \ncoincides with the top of the transition zone into hard overpressure. The encircled data points \nare outliers from the trend and so may contain errors.  \nFigure 9. Pressure-depth plot for well NWP-9 with density, sonic, and resistivity log data for \nthe mudrocks.  \nFigure 10. Pressure-depth plot for well NWP-16 with density, sonic, and resistivity log data \nfor the mudrocks.  \nFigure 11. Crossplots of density against sonic transit time and resistivity for well NWP-9. \nData points on unloading trends are encircled in blue.\nFigure 12.
