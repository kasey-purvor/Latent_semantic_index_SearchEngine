More recently, trypanosomes have\nalso emerged as useful model organisms for studying the\nconstruction and remodelling of the cytoskeleton and, in\nparticular, the biogenesis of the eukaryotic flagellum (Gull,\n1999; McKean et al., 2003; Vaughan and Gull, 2003).\nThe basic cellular architecture of all trypanosomatid cells is\nstrikingly similar, with cellular morphology being defined\nlargely by an array of subpellicular microtubules that are cross-\nlinked to each other and to the plasma membrane (Gull, 1999).\nAll trypanosomatids contain a precise organization of\nsingle-copy organelles, such as the nucleus, mitochondrion,\nkinetoplast (containing the mitochondrial genome), basal body\nand flagellum. In trypanosomatids, the flagellum beats from tip\nto base, with anterior and posterior poles of the cell defined\naccording to their position during motility (Robinson et al.,\n1995).\nMany detailed cytological studies on trypanosome\nmorphogenesis have been undertaken on the procyclic\n(trypomastigote) forms of the African trypanosome T. brucei\n(Ogbadoyi et al., 2003; Robinson and Gull, 1991; Robinson et\nal., 1995; Sherwin and Gull, 1989a; Sherwin and Gull, 1989b).\nAlthough these studies can be seen as providing a model\nfor understanding trypanosome morphogenesis per se,\nfundamental differences do exist between species and also\nbetween distinct developmental forms of the same species\nduring life-cycle alternations between the mammalian host and\ninsect vector. In trypanosomatid biology, classical descriptive\nterminology is largely based on the relative positioning of the\nkinetoplast and nucleus within the cell body (Hoare and\nWallace, 1966; Robertson, 1912; Robertson, 1913). However\nit should be emphasized that, although the same developmental\nform may occur at distinct stages of the life cycle (of the same\nor different trypanosome species), it does not necessarily\nfollow that such forms have identical morphogenetic or cell-\ncycle regulatory mechanisms.\nProcyclic trypomastigote forms of T. brucei at the beginning\nof their cell cycle possess a single flagellum that exits the cell\nbody near the posterior end through an invagination of\nthe plasma membrane known as the flagellar pocket.\nSubsequently, as the flagellum extends towards the anterior\nend, it follows a clearly defined left-handed helical path\n(Sherwin and Gull, 1989a). The flagellum is, for most of its\nlength, attached to the cell body via a specialized attachment\nregion called the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ) (Kohl et\nal., 1999). The FAZ consists of a series of filaments and\n1641\nThroughout its elongation, the new flagellum of the\nprocyclic form of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma\nbrucei is tethered at its tip to the lateral aspect of the old\nflagellum. This phenomenon provides a cytotactic\nmechanism for influencing inheritance of cellular pattern.\nHere, we show that this tethering is produced via a discrete,\nmobile transmembrane junction \u2013 the flagella connector.\nLight and electron microscopy reveal that the flagella\nconnector links the extending microtubules at the tip of the\nnew flagellum to the lateral aspect of three of the doublet\nmicrotubules in the old flagellar axoneme. Two sets of\nfilaments connect the microtubules to three plates on the\ninner faces of the old and new flagellar membranes. Three\ndifferentiated areas of old and new flagellar membranes\nare then juxtaposed and connected by a central interstitial\ncore of electron-dense material. The flagella connector is\nformed early in flagellum extension and is removed at the\nend of cytokinesis, but the exact timing of the latter event\nis slightly variable. The flagella connector represents a\nnovel form of cellular junction that is both dynamic and\nmobile.\nMovies available online\nKey words: Trypanosome, Flagellum, Morphogenesis, Cell junction,\nFlagella connector, Cytotaxis\nSummary\nThe flagella connector of Trypanosoma brucei: an\nunusual mobile transmembrane junction\nLaura J.

Both the PFR and the microtubule-based axoneme\nhave been shown to have roles in flagellar motility in T.\nbrucei. Importantly, as the new flagellum elongates, strict\ncytological positioning rules apply, so that the new flagellum\nis always located to the left of the old flagellum when the cell\nis viewed from the posterior end (Sherwin and Gull, 1989a).\nRecently, a mechanistic explanation for this conserved\ncytological positioning has been described, with electron-\nmicroscopy (EM) studies revealing that in procyclic\n(trypomastigote) forms of T. brucei the new flagellum is\nphysically tethered to the old flagellum by a structure termed\nthe flagella connector (Moreira-Leite et al., 2001). The\nflagella connector connects the distal tip of the new flagellum\nto the lateral aspect of the old via what appears to be a highly\nunusual cell-cell functional complex. Significantly, the\nposition of the flagella connector is not fixed because, as the\nnew flagellum elongates, the flagella connector migrates\nalong the old flagellum towards the distal tip. The physical\nconnection afforded by the flagella connector ensures that the\nelongating new flagellum traces the same helical path along\nthe cell as the old flagellum and undoubtedly influences\ninternal cytoskeletal arrangements. This reproduction of\nflagella high-order positioning and cell architecture by an\nexisting cytological structure (the old flagellum) represents\nan example of the epigenetic phenomenon of cytotaxis\n(Beisson and Sonneborn, 1965; Sonneborn, 1963; Sonneborn,\n1964).\nThe flagella connector must be a structure that can link the\ngrowing microtubules at the tip of the new flagellum to the\nlateral aspect of microtubules in the old flagellum and, in doing\nso, must entail a link across two flagellar membranes.\nIn this paper, we provide a detailed structural\ncharacterization of the flagella connector using high-\nresolution EM and also provide a conceptual model for\nthe ultrastructural organization of the flagella connector.\nFurthermore, we describe the characterization of a\nmonoclonal antibody with specificity for the flagella\nconnector that has enabled direct visualization of the temporal\nevents of flagella connector acquisition and loss during the\ntrypanosome cell cycle. Both these light and EM studies\nindicate that the flagella connector is assembled very early\nduring the formation of the new flagellum at a specific point\nbefore its exit from the flagellar pocket. By contrast, the direct\nmicroscopic observation of live cells undergoing cytokinesis\nsuggests that the timing of flagella connector separation is\nvariable. Intriguingly, despite the apparent importance of this\nstructure to morphogenesis in procyclic-form trypanosomes,\nwe have so far been unable to find evidence for this same\nstructure in other developmental forms, thus raising\ninteresting questions about the particular requirement for such\nmorphogenetic patterning in the procyclic trypomastigote\nforms of T. brucei.\nMaterials and Methods\nCulture of trypanosomes\nProcyclic T. brucei 427 cell line was cultured in SDM 79 medium\nsupplemented with 10% foetal calf serum at 28\u00b0C (Brun and\nSchonenberger, 1979). Cultures of bloodstream form T. brucei (Wirtz\net al., 1999) were grown in HMI-9 at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 (Hirumi and\nHirumi, 1989).\nImmunolocalization studies and antibodies\nTrypanosomes were settled onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides,\ncytoskeletons prepared by extraction with 1% NP-40 in 100 mM\nPIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA and fixed\nin methanol at \u201320\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Cells were double labelled with\nanti-PFR monoclonal antibody L8C4 (IgG) and AB1 (IgM)\n(recognizing the flagella connector), and developed with secondary\nantibodies FITC-conjugated (IgG, Sigma) and TRITC-conjugated\n(IgM, Chemicon). Cells were embedded in Vectashield with DAPI\n(4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories, USA). Slides\nwere examined on a Leica DMRX microscope, captured on a CCD\ncamera and processed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe).\nPreparation of cells for EM\nCells were prepared for scanning EM (SEM) and transmission EM\n(TEM) essentially as described previously (Moreira-Leite et al., 2001;\nSherwin and Gull, 1989a). Immunolocalizations at the EM level were\nperformed as described previously (Scott et al., 1997; Sherwin and\nGull, 1989b; Woods et al., 1989) except that, in some circumstances,\nmethanol fixation or unfixed cytoskeletons were used.\nVideo images of live trypanosomes\nVideo sequences [see Movies 1-4 (http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/\nsupplemental\/)] were made on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope\nequipped with differential interference contrast optics using a\nPhotometrics Coolsnap FX camera and processed in Metamorph\n(Universal Imaging).\nResults\nVisualization of the flagella connector structure\nnegative-stain TEM\nThe major morphological events occurring during the cell cycle\nof procyclic trypanosomes are shown schematically in Fig. 1A.\nAt the beginning of the cell cycle (G1), a trypanosome cell\npossesses a single kinetoplast, nucleus and flagellum (1K1N).\nAs the new flagellum elongates along the length of the cell\nbody, it follows a path defined by the old flagellum because of\nthe physical connection afforded by the flagella connector\n(Moreira-Leite et al., 2001).\nFurther examination of dividing cells by negative-staining\nTEM on detergent-extracted whole-mount cytoskeletons has\nproduced a series of high-resolution images of the flagella\nconnector. In Fig. 1B,C, negative staining allows the\nvisualization of three different areas of electron transparency\nseparated by two areas of stain penetration, which describes a\ntrilaminar structure. The overall width of this trilaminar\nstructure is ~90nm (Fig. 1C). The central core layer 2 is ~18\nnm wide and is the thickest of the three layers. The layer closest\nJournal of Cell Science 117 (9)\n1643Trypanosome flagella connector\nto the old axoneme (layer 3) is the next thickest layer at ~16\nnm, with the layer closest to the tip of the new flagellum (layer\n1) being the thinnest at ~13 nm. This layer is connected to the\ntip of the new axoneme by a set of filaments. There is therefore\na pronounced asymmetry in the structure and interactions of\nthe trilaminar core structure and the axonemes of the new and\nold flagella.\nThe trilaminar core structure of the connector extends for\n~400 nm, running parallel to the axis of the microtubules of\nthe old flagellum. Overall, the filaments and trilaminar\nstructure present a roughly triangular appearance for the\nflagella connector in these types of negative stain preparations.\nSignificantly this structure has only ever been observed at the\nend of the new flagellum; it is not present, nor have we ever\nobserved any structural remnants, at the end of the old\nflagellum (Fig. 1D).\nVisualization of the flagella connector by thin-section\nTEM\nWe then asked whether it would be possible to visualize the\nflagella connector structure by thin-section EM. Although\ntrypanosomes are biflagellate for approximately half of the cell\ncycle (possessing an elongating \u2018new\u2019 flagellum and a fully\nelongated \u2018old\u2019 flagellum) (Sherwin and Gull, 1989a;\nWoodward and Gull, 1990), there is no easy way to enrich for\npreparations of the flagella connector. Therefore, trypanosome\ncells were simply fixed and processed for analysis by thin-\nsection EM and an extensive search undertaken for the flagella\nconnector structure. This approach generated several images\nthat revealed a significant set of additional features to those\nalready recognized in cytoskeletal preparations.\nBecause of the strict cytological positioning rules that apply\nduring trypanosome morphogenesis, the new flagellum is\nalways present on the left-hand side of the old flagellum when\nthe cell is viewed from the posterior end. In electron\nmicrographs, this polarity can be determined because of the\naxial polarity of the outer microtubule doublets and associated\ndynein arms (Sherwin and Gull, 1989a). All micrographs in\nFig. 2 are oriented such that the old flagellum is on the right\nand the new flagellum is on the left. The flagella connector was\nonly observed when a section passed through the distal tip\nof the new flagellum (Fig. 2A). Structural clues in the\nmicrographs allow us to know that such sections are at the\ndistal tip of the new flagellum as there is no accompanying PFR\nin the new flagellum, no underlying FAZ connection to the cell\nbody and often no full set of microtubules. These are the\nexpected features given the timing of morphogenesis of each\ncomponent determined previously (Kohl et al., 1999).\nThe flagella connector can be seen in Fig. 2A as a region\nwhere the membranes of the new and old flagella are\njuxtaposed and have a greater electron density and more linear\nprofile. The increased electron density of the membranes is\norganized in three distinct zones, each associated with plate-\nlike areas of electron density within both the old and the new\nflagella (Fig. 2A, Fig. 3). We observe that the three plates\nFig. 1. Visualization of the\nflagella connector at the distal tip\nof the new flagellum. (A) The\ncell cycle of procyclic\ntrypanosomes. At G1,\ntrypanosomes posses a single\nkinetoplast and a single nucleus\n(1K1N) with a single attached\nflagellum. During the cell cycle,\nnew flagellum elongation\ncoincides with kinetoplast\nduplication and segregation\n(2K1N). The new flagellum is\nphysically attached to the old\nflagellum via the flagella\nconnector. Following mitosis\n(2K2N) and the initiation of\ncytokinesis, this connection is\nreleased.

(C) The\nflagella connector consists of a\ntrilaminar core structure\ncomposed of three distinct layers\nof electron density (layers 1,2,3)\nand filamentous extensions (marked with a bar) extending to the tip of the new flagellum. This gives roughly an overall triangular appearance.\n(D) No flagella connector structure is evident at the tip of the old flagellum. Scale bars, 200 nm (B), 100 nm (C,D).\n1644\nwithin the old flagellum are more extensive (~20 nm wide) than\nthose of the new (~15 nm wide), again emphasizing the\nasymmetric nature of the flagella connector. Behind these\nplates, we can observe electron-dense filamentous extensions\nleading back to specific axonemal microtubules. Owing to the\ninvariant linkages between specific outer doublets of the\naxoneme and the PFR (Sherwin and Gull, 1989a), we can\nunambiguously assign these connections to axonemal outer\nmicrotubule doublets 7, 8 and 9 in the old flagellum. It is more\ndifficult to assign the connections between the three plates in\nthe new flagellum to particular axonemal doublets because of\nthe absence of a PFR at this region.\nThe intraflagellar plates and the specialized flagellar\nmembrane zones are reflected in three further discrete zones of\nelectron-dense material between the opposing flagellar\nmembranes. Each of these interstitial zones is symmetrical and\ncontains three separate layers of electron-dense\nmaterial running parallel to the membranes with the\ncentral layer having a greater electron density than\nthe two outer layers. The interstitial zone is around\n32 nm wide.\nBased upon the analysis of many thin section and\nnegative staining transmission electron\nmicrographs, we have constructed a schematic\ninterpretation of the ultrastructure of the flagella\nconnector (Fig. 3).

Between the membranes of the new and the old\nflagellum, we propose the existence of transmembrane protein\ncomponents linking the membranes of the new and old\nflagellum via the interstitial central material. Our current\nevidence indicates that the flagella connector involves\nintraflagellar connections to axonemal outer doublets 7-9 of the\nold flagellum.\nMonoclonal antibody AB1 defines the flagella connector\nIn an attempt to understand further the temporal events\nassociated with the morphogenesis of the flagella connector\nduring the cell cycle, we produced a monoclonal antibody\nspecific for the flagella connector structure. Over the years,\nexperience has shown that mice often produce\n(natural) antibodies that detect the cytoskeletal\nstructures of trypanosomes. These are often IgM\nantibodies and such an antibody was indeed\nrecognized serendipitously in a screen for\nanti-trypanosomal-cytoskeleton antibodies. This\nmonoclonal antibody was termed AB1 and has\nbeen characterized as an IgM that recognizes the\ntip of the new flagellum but not the tip of the old.\nWe then asked whether this monoclonal\ndetected the tip of the axoneme of the new\nflagellum or the flagella connector structure.\nWhole-mount cytoskeletons were fixed and\nprepared using a range of methods for immunogold\nlocalization of AB1 by electron microscopy. In all\npreparations, the immunogold labelling shows that the\nantibody detects a central component of the flagella connector\n(Fig. 4). The fix and blocking reagents used in such whole-\nmount EM techniques obscure the structures involved and so\nwe have been unable to obtain a higher definition. To date, we\nhave also not been able to use this antibody successfully to\nlabel sections using pre- or post-embedding techniques, or in\nwestern blots (often a characteristic of these natural IgM\nantibodies).\nTiming of flagella connector formation\nAB1 is an extremely useful probe for studying flagella\nconnector morphogenesis during the cell cycle using\nimmunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). Trypanosome cells\nFig. 4. Immunogold EM with the AB1 monoclonal\nantibody.

Scale bars, 2 m m.\n1647Trypanosome flagella connector\nimmunofluorescent signal of the AB1 monoclonal is seen near\nthe kinetoplast at a position just above the basal body (Fig. 5B).\nWe judge that the AB1 signal is internal to the flagellar pocket\nbecause there is a gap between the AB1 signal and the start of\nthe PFR in the old flagellum, which runs alongside the\naxoneme but only after the flagellum has emerged from the\nflagellar pocket.\nWe were interested to determine whether this\nimmunofluorescent signal was indeed an indication of the\npresence of the flagella connector at an early stage in the cell\ncycle. Hence, we conducted an extensive search using thin-\nsection EM for sections of trypanosomes in which two flagella\nwere present within a single flagellar pocket. Although\neventually each flagellum exits from its own pocket, the newly\nelongating flagellum initially emerges from the same flagellar\npocket as the old flagellum. Consequently, the presence of two\nflagella in a single pocket (Fig. 2C) represents a very early\nstage in the biogenesis of the new flagellum. Although this is\na glancing section, it is clear that the flagella connector\nstructure (represented by an asterisk) is present between the\nnew flagellum and old flagellum at a position just above the\ntransition zone of each flagellum. This indicates that the\nflagella connector is formed concomitant with the formation of\nthe new flagellar axoneme or potentially even before axonemal\nnucleation.\nIn cells with an elongated new flagellum that has exited the\nflagellar pocket the AB1 signal is seen at the expected position\nof the flagella connector \u2013 at the tip of the new flagellum and\nalongside the lateral aspect of the old flagellum (Fig. 5C). The\nconnector is still present in post-mitotic cells 2K2N (Fig. 5D).\nHowever, in cells that are clearly post-mitotic and in which a\ncytokinesis furrow is well advanced, no connector signal is\nvisible, indicating that the flagellar connector (as defined by\nthe AB1 signal) is removed at a late stage in the cell cycle (Fig.\n5E).\nTiming of flagellum detachment during cytokinesis\nIn order directly to address the issue of when physical detachment\nof the flagellar connector occurs, we analysed live cells that were\njudged to be at a late stage in the cell cycle. In such cells, the\ncleavage furrow had already been initiated and was clearly visible\nbetween the two daughter cells. Four such movies are presented\nonline (http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/supplemental\/). These examples\nshow that the flagellum-flagellum detachment does not occur at\na single precise point in the cell cycle but rather that there is some\nvariation. Detachment can occur at various points between mid-\nto late cleavage and post-cleavage stages. In Movies 1 and 2,\nflagellum-flagellum detachment occurs at an early stage during\ncytokinesis. In these movies, the daughter with the new flagellum\nis always at the posterior end and it can be seen that these\ndaughters have a highly motile anterior end, even though the new\nflagellum remains initially attached to the old flagellum via the\nflagellar connector (http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/supplemental\/). The\ncleavage furrow is well advanced in cells in Movies 3 and 4 but\nthe cells remain attached at the flagellar connector. The timing of\ndetachment is variable. Movie 1 shows two cells in which\nflagellum-flagellum detachment takes place before completion\nof cytokinesis, whereas Movie 4 shows two cells that have\ncompleted cytokinesis but remain attached by the flagella\nconnector and only subsequently detach when the flagella\nconnector linkage is broken.\nFlagella connector \u2013 cell-type and species-specific\ndifferences\nThe presence of the flagellar connector influences the shape\nand morphogenesis of the procyclic trypanosome cell because\nit is clear that, although basal bodies move apart before\nmitosis, the tip of the new flagellum remains attached to the\nside of the old flagellum (Fig. 6A). However, the morphology\nof different trypanosomatid cell types varies both between\nspecies and also within the same species. We therefore asked\nwhether the strict organization of the old and new flagella also\noccurred in the bloodstream trypomastigote cell cycle of T.\nbrucei. Both procyclic (tsetse midgut) forms and mammalian\nbloodstream forms of T. brucei are trypomastigotes. The term\n\u2018trypomastigote\u2019 refers to trypanosome forms with an attached\nflagellum for much of the cell length and a kinetoplast\nposterior to the nucleus. One crucial difference between\nprocyclic trypomastigotes and bloodstream trypomastigotes is\nthat, in procyclics, the post-mitotic nuclei occupy a position\non either side of the previously segregated kinetoplasts (Fig.\n7). This contrasts with bloodstream trypomastigotes, in which\nboth the kinetoplasts are positioned posterior to the nuclei\nthroughout division. It is evident from the scanning electron\nA         B        C       D  \nE      F        G       H\nFig. 7. Cartoon of the cell cycle in T. brucei trypomastigotes. (A-D) Procyclic form. (E-H) Bloodstream forms. Apart from differences in cell\nshape between the two forms, the segregation of the kinetoplast is more limited in the bloodstream form (G) than in the procyclic form (C).\n(D) In the procyclic form, the new kinetoplast and nucleus are located towards the posterior end of the cell, but the orientation of the nuclei in a\npost-mitotic bloodstream cell are not in the same configuration (H). The two kinetoplasts are located at the posterior end of the cell and the\nnuclei are both located anterior to the kinetoplast.\n1648\nmicrographs of bloodstream-form trypomastigotes (Fig.\n6B,C) that the tip of the new flagellum is located close to the\nlateral aspect of the old flagellum in bloodstream forms but\ndoes not appear to contact it directly as it does in procyclic\ntrypomastigotes (Fig. 6A-C). Although the bloodstream\ntrypomastigotes sometimes exhibited a small structure at the\nnew flagellum tip, this was often also seen at the tip of the old\nflagellum (Fig. 6B), suggesting that it did not represent a\nflagella connector. We asked whether we could visualize the\ncanonical flagella connector structure by negative staining of\nbloodstream-form whole-mount cytoskeletons (Fig. 6D).\nAlthough some amorphous material was sometimes associated\nwith the tip of the new flagellum, it did not reveal a convincing\nstructure with the complexity of the procyclic flagella\nconnector. Moreover, the orientation of the new flagellum\nappears to be slightly different to that of the old, in that the\ntip of the new axoneme most often lies close to the PFR of\nthe old flagellum (Fig. 6D) rather than close to the axoneme\nas in procyclic cells (Fig. 1B). We also asked whether we\ncould detect the AB1 monoclonal signal in the bloodstream\ntrypomastigotes, but we were unable to do so in cells at any\nstage of the cell cycle (Fig. 6E). Therefore, although the new\nflagellum of bloodstream trypomastigotes maintains a position\nclose to the old, we cannot define the presence of a canonical\nflagella connector structure as defined in the procyclic\ntrypomastigotes.\nWe then studied two proliferative forms of related parasitic\nprotozoa, the epimastigote form of T. cruzi and the\npromastigote form of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis. In\nneither of these cases could we find any evidence for a flagella\nconnector of any type (Fig. 6F,G). Electron micrographs of\nT. cruzi epimastigote cytoskeletons, which possess a semi-\nattached flagellum, show that the new flagellum is relatively\nfree from the old even at an early stage of the cell cycle (Fig.\n6F); this was also the case for the dividing promastigote cells\nof L. mexicana, which possess a free flagellum (Fig. 6G).\nDiscussion\nStructural characterization of the flagella connector\nThe flagella connector of procyclic form T. brucei represents a\ncomplex membrane-membrane connection with some initial\nsimilarities to other cell-cell junctions that have been well\ndescribed in higher eukaryotic systems such as desmosomes\nand tight junctions. However, although junctions such as\ndesmosomes represent specialized morphological structures\nthat facilitate the intercellular anchoring of adjacent cells\n(Burdett, 1998; Kitajima, 2002) and other metazoan junctions\nfunction as occluding or communicating junctions, the flagella\nconnector represents a connection between two discrete\nmembrane-bound compartments of the same cell.\nOur electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations\nindicates that the flagella connector is composed of an\nasymmetric central core of three electron-dense components.\nEach of the two electron-dense, outside layers of this trilaminar\nstructure is linked to axonemal microtubules via filaments.\nThin section EM however, reveals that the flagellar membranes\nare locally differentiated within a set of three discrete regions\nand each of these presents a further electron-dense, interstitial\nstructure between the two juxtapositioned flagellar\nmembranes.\nThe interstitial connections could represent transmembrane\ncomponents from each flagellar membrane interacting with\neach other at the centre of the intermembrane space, thus\nexplaining the greater electron density found at the centre of\nthe intermembrane space. The model would suggest that the\ncytoplasmic \u2018tail\u2019 of the flagella connector transmembrane\ncomponents is associated with the electron-dense plates\ninternal to each flagellum. These plates then make connections\nto specific microtubule outer doublets of the axoneme via\nfilamentous connections.\nThe flagella connector structure is not symmetrical. When\nviewed in cross section, an asymmetrical relationship exists\nbetween the trilaminar core of the flagella connector and the\nnew\/old axonemes. This asymmetry might indicate that the\nelectron-dense plates internal to the old and new flagella are\ncomposed of different structural components. These\ndifferences presumably reflect the different roles on both sides\nof the connector, with one side always maintaining a tight\nconnection to the lateral aspect of the existing microtubules of\nthe old flagellum, while the other connects to the extending tip\nof the new flagellum. The flagella connector is a strong tether\nbut must also be flexible enough to cope with flagellar beating,\nallowing the junction to be dynamic in the membrane while\nanchored to the microtubules. This type of flexibility\nis observed in live cells [see supplementary data\n(http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/supplemental\/)] where the tip of the\nnew flagellum is highly motile and often seen in different\norientations, sometimes running parallel to and sometimes\nperpendicular to the old flagellum.\nOther axonemal tip structures\nThe flagella connector is linked to the distal tip of the axoneme\nof the new flagellum, where the \u2018plus\u2019 ends of the new\naxonemal microtubules are located. It is therefore suitably\npositioned to act as a capping structure for the new flagellum\nduring elongation. However, several lines of evidence suggest\nthat the flagella connector is not an axonemal cap, or at least\nthat it does not act uniquely as a capping structure. In many\nsystems both the central pair and the outer doublet\nmicrotubules are linked to flagellar membranes by a central\nmicrotubule cap and distal filaments. First, axonemal capping\nstructures are linked to the \u2018plus\u2019 ends of all axonemal\nmicrotubules (Dentler, 1990; LeCluyse and Dentler, 1984).\nOur EM evidence suggests that the flagella connector is\nprobably connected to a subset of axonemal microtubules\nbecause the flagella connector frequently appears to be linked\nonly to those axonemal microtubules that are closer to the old\nflagellum. Second, axonemal caps are believed to have a role\nin controlling microtubule dynamics at the distal end of\nthe axoneme. They form during axonemal growth but are\nmaintained after ciliary and flagellar elongation, and are\npresent in the mature appendages (Dentler, 1990). By contrast,\nboth our EM and immunofluorescence data indicate that the\nflagella connector is not present on the mature (old) flagella of\nT. brucei, supporting its role as a cytotactic transducer rather\nthan a structure involved per se in flagellum dynamics.\nAxonemal cross-linking at the flagella connector\nThe three flagella connector domains in the membrane of each\nJournal of Cell Science 117 (9)\n1649Trypanosome flagella connector\nflagellum oppose each other and are linked to specific outer\ndoublet microtubules of the flagella axonemes. In turn, each of\nthese three domains is cross-linked to particular axonemal\nouter doublets, one set belonging to the new flagellum and\nanother set belonging to the old flagellum. As a consequence,\nsix axonemal outer doublets are involved in the flagellum-\nflagellum attachment. Our evidence suggests a model in which\naxonemal outer doublets 7-9 from the old flagellum and three\n(as yet unspecified) outer doublets from the new flagellum are\ninvolved in the flagella connector cross-linking.\nIt should be realized that some form of axonemal cross-\nlinking has been described in other systems, often for apparent\nimposition of co-ordinated or synchronized beating (Dentler,\n1990). In ctenophores, for instance, axonemal cross-linking is\nobserved in both macrocilia and the ciliary swimming plates,\nwhere it aids in the generation of synchronized beating. In\nmacrocilia, 200-250 identically oriented axonemes are directly\ncross-linked to each other and enclosed by a single unique\nmembrane (Tamm and Tamm, 1985). The situation in the\nswimming plate is more similar to that found at the flagella\nconnector, because the axonemes are linked to the ciliary\nmembrane and the membranes interact with each other\n(Dentler, 1981).\nThe flagella connector appears to be localized perpendicular\nto the plane of beating, at least in the old flagellum, in which\nouter doublet microtubules 7, 8 and 9 seem to be linked to the\nmembrane. Significantly, this does not disrupt the motility of\nthe old flagellum, which implies that either the structure of the\nflagella connector is flexible enough to accommodate the\nsliding between doublets 7-9 or that the contacts between outer\ndoublets 7-9 and the membrane at the flagella connector are\ntransient.\nHowever, an important difference between the flagella\nconnector and the axonemal cross-linking that occurs in\nctenophores is that the flagella connector mediates a singular\nattachment: it does not link the flagella to each other\nthroughout their length, but solely at one specific, but different,\nsite in each flagellum.\nTemporal events of flagella connector formation and\nremoval\nBoth immunofluorescence and the EM data indicate that the\nflagella connector is produced very early in the trypanosome\ncell cycle, before the new flagellum exits the flagella pocket.\nLongitudinal sections through the flagella pocket show that the\nflagella connector is present between the new and old flagellum\nimmediately above the transition zone of the new flagellum.\nThe transition zone of the basal body is the region responsible\nfor the nucleation of the axonemal central pair microtubules,\nC1 and C2. Although it is difficult to be categorical, the\njuxtaposition of the flagella connector and the transition zone\nsuggests that flagella connector formation might be almost\ncoincident with the nucleation of the flagella axoneme. Our\nmodel would certainly be consistent with this interpretation,\nalthough prior nucleation of the flagellar axonemal outer\ndoublet microtubules would be required to \u2018hard wire\u2019 the\nintraflagellar connections.\nIn trypanosomes, the new flagellum is produced by the\nelongation and maturation of the probasal body, a structure that\nlies immediately alongside the mature basal body, subtending\nthe old flagellum (Gull, 1999; Sherwin and Gull, 1989a;\nVaughan and Gull, 2003). As the probasal body elongates, it\nprotrudes through the plasma membrane of the flagellar pocket\nalongside the old flagellum. Although we have not visualized\nthis event, it appears to be mechanistically reasonable that\nconnections between the two flagella form as consequence of\nthis initial elongation event, rather than relying upon the de\nnovo association of two flagellar membranes within the pocket.\nAlthough a greater understanding of flagella connector\nformation awaits the understanding of these early-stage\nflagella, our present model provides a firm basis for further\nstudies in that it gives the first overall description of the\nstructural organization and components.\nDirect microscopic observation of cells in division [see\nMovies 1-4 (http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/supplemental\/)] suggests\nthat the precise timing of flagella connector removal might be\nvariable relative to cytokinesis in T. brucei. Although the\nsignificance of this variation might ultimately be trivial, it is\nclear that daughter cells are unable to complete cell separation\nuntil the flagella connector attachment is broken. An important\nquestion to be resolved is therefore the mechanism by which\nthis highly ordered and previously robust connection is\nsevered. Clues might be derived from studies on cultured\nepithelial cells, in which desmosomal assembly and\ndisassembly appears to be regulated by Ca2+ acting through\nreversible protein phosphorylation involving both protein\nkinases and phosphatases (Kitajima, 2002). The involvement\nof protein phosphorylation in flagella connector assembly and\ndisassembly certainly warrants further study but, as yet, the\nmechanism of flagella connector severing remains solely a\nmatter of conjecture.\nFlagella connector \u2013 an unusual mobile junction\nAlthough the flagella connector forms within the flagellar\npocket of the trypanosome, the flagella connector is observed\nto migrate along the old flagellum as the new flagellum\nelongates. The EM data and the model we have constructed\nindicate that the flagella connector connects outer doublets of\nboth the new and old flagellum, with outer doublets 7-9 of the\nold axoneme acting to guide the new flagellum along the cell\naxis occupied by the old flagellum. Conceptually, the flagella\nconnector can be visualized as a railway bogey moving along\na three-track line. However, at present, we are unable to\ndetermine whether the flagella connector has an active or a\npassive role in this process. It is possible that the flagella\nconnector actively moves along the microtubules as a result of\nthe activity of microtubule plus-end-directed motors such as\nkinesin (Kull, 2000), or movement along the outer doublets\nmight be passive, resulting from the microtubule outgrowth of\nthe new flagellum. We imagine that the rate of connector\nmovement matches the extension kinetics of the new flagellum\n(Robinson et al., 1995). Whatever mechanism is responsible\nfor flagella connector movement, this structure is a highly\nunusual junctional complex. Although cell-cell junctions are\nclearly not unusual in biology, such structures are not\nthemselves directly associated with mobility.\nIt should also be realized that flagellum junctional complexes\nhave previously been described in trypanosomatids, where they\nmediate attachment of flagella to host surfaces. At the site of\ncontact, the flagellar membrane is observed to expand and\n1650\nabundant filamentous material is present, contacting electron-\ndense plaques internal to the membrane and lining the region\nof attachment (Beattie and Gull, 1997; Tetley and Vickerman,\n1985; Vickerman, 1985; Vickerman et al., 1988). Although\nthese junctions have been referred to as \u2018desmosomes\u2019 or \u2018hemi-\ndesmosomes\u2019, there is also no evidence to indicate that they\nare biochemically related to the desmosomes and hemi-\ndesmosomes found in higher eukaryotes.\nAre these flagellum attachment structures related to the\nflagella connector? Although certain components could be\nshared between the flagella connector and these flagellum\nattachment complexes, the two structures differ in certain key\nrespects. For instance, the attachment complexes do not have\nthe characteristic trilaminar core structure of the flagella\nconnector and, more importantly, they do not exhibit the overt\nmobility demonstrated by the flagella connector.\nBiochemical complexity of the flagella connector\nThe electron micrographs presented in this study suggest that\na high degree of structural sophistication exists in the flagella\nconnector that is likely to be reflected in biochemical\ncomplexity. In addition to the filamentous connections between\nmicrotubule outer doublets and the internal face of the flagellar\nmembrane, transmembrane linkages are also in evidence\nlinking the two flagella. Moreover given that the flagella\nconnector is mobile, motor proteins capable of progressing this\njunctional complex along the old flagellum are likely to be an\nimportant component of the flagella connector assembly.\nAlthough the biochemical composition of the flagella\nconnector remains unknown at present, antibodies such as AB1\ndo suggest a way forward with regards to biochemical\ncharacterization of the flagella connector. Unfortunately, AB1\n(an IgM monoclonal) does not blot, making standard\napproaches (such as expression library screening) unsuitable.\nWe are therefore currently raising new antibodies to\ncytoskeletal fractions of T. brucei and screening for flagella-\nconnector-specific antibodies that also recognize T. brucei\nproteins in immunoblotting. The identification of constituent\nflagella connector proteins will of course then enable us to\ninvestigate the functional role of such proteins. The molecular\nablation of T. brucei proteins by RNAi techniques shows great\nutility in trypanosome research and has already proved to be\nextremely informative in elucidating the structural basis of the\naxoneme and the PFR in T. brucei (Bastin et al., 1998; McKean\net al., 2003).\nSpecies- and stage-specific assembly of the flagella\nconnector\nAt present, we are unclear about why the canonical flagella\nconnector structure that we have described for the procyclic\nform of T. brucei is not present (or is not so easily visualized)\nin bloodstream trypomastigote forms or in other forms such as\nepimastigotes or promastigotes of other trypanosomatids such\nas T. cruzi or Leishmania. Because the basic structure of the\nflagellum does not vary significantly, one explanation might lie\nin differences in morphogenetic patterning that exist between\ndistinct morphological forms of trypanosomatids (Vickerman\nand Preston, 1976). Trypomastigote forms of T. brucei\nrepresent an extreme structural case in which the external\nflagellum is attached to the cell body for most of its length and\nso influences the internal cytoskeletal architecture of the cell.\nThe components and principles of the construction of this\ncytoskeleton, including the contribution of templating and\ncytotactic phenomena, have been rehearsed previously (Gull,\n1999; Moreira-Leite et al., 2001; Robinson et al., 1995;\nSherwin and Gull, 1989a; Sherwin and Gull, 1989b;\nWoodward and Gull, 1990). Thus, in procyclic trypomastigote\nforms of T. brucei, the flagellum-FAZ complex has a central\nrole in cell morphogenesis and so, at this stage, the flagella\nconnector can easily be interpreted as being crucial for the\ninheritance of cell shape and polarity. By contrast, in T. cruzi\nepimastigotes, in which the FAZ is confined to the anterior end\nof the cell, flagellum attachment is not required for efficient\ncell division (Cooper et al., 1993). In the same manner, the\npromastigotes of Leishmania have a free flagellum that\nemerges from a pocket at one pole of the elongated cell.\nHowever, trypomastigote bloodstream forms of T. brucei do\nhave a long flagellum extending from posterior to anterior and\nconnected to the cell body throughout most of its length.\nCuriously, although the distal tip of the new flagellum remains\nclose to the old flagellum during cell duplication, we have found\nno evidence of the canonical flagella connector structure. Are\nthere differences between bloodstream forms and procyclic\ntrypomastigotes that explain this different requirement for the\nflagella connector? First, it should be realized that the shape of\nbloodstream and procyclic cells are strikingly different. As a\nconsequence, expansion of the subpellicular cortex during cell\nduplication differs between bloodstream and procyclic forms.\nIn particular, it appears that the cortical area between the new\nand the old flagella suffers less expansion during cell division\nof the bloodstream form. The limited remodelling and\nexpansion of the subpellicular cortex that takes place during\nbloodstream-form division might allow the new internal\ncytoskeleton to be formed in the correct direction without the\naid of a positional clue provided by the old flagellum via the\nflagella connector. By contrast, the flagella connector might\nbe required to guarantee the fidelity of new cytoskeletal\npositioning in the context of the more extensive subpellicular\ncortex expansion observed in dividing procyclic cells.\nAnother important morphogenetic difference between\nprocyclic and bloodstream forms of T. brucei relates to\nkinetoplast positioning during cell division. In bloodstream\nforms, kinetoplasts undergo only limited segregation but, in\ndividing procyclic forms, one kinetoplast (associated with the\nnew flagellum) undergoes substantial migration to the posterior\nend of the cell. Mitosis then places one daughter nucleus into\nthe gap opened up by this movement (see Fig. 7 for contrasting\nstyles of organelle positioning). Attachment of the new\nflagellum to the old in the procyclic trypomastigote form might\nbe required for the extensive kinetoplast\/basal-body migration\nand internal cytoskeletal remodelling but not for the limited\nkinetoplast movement in the bloodstream form. These\nconjectures however, have the caveat that the track along\nthe cell followed by the new flagellum in bloodstream\ntrypanosomes is not random and there might well be a variant\nof the connector phenomenon operating.\nThese studies clearly raise important questions regarding the\ncurrent terminology of cell types and morphogenesis in\ntrypanosomes. Although both procyclic and bloodstream forms\nof T. brucei are defined as trypomastigotes, different structural\nJournal of Cell Science 117 (9)\n1651Trypanosome flagella connector\nmechanisms appear to operate to safeguard the fidelity of cell\nshape determination and the segregation and polarized\nlocalization of cytoplasmic organelles during cell duplication.\nNo doubt the burgeoning use of RNA interference to ablate\nexpression of proteins and produce phenotypes will see\ninteresting variations appear between cell cycle control and\ncytoskeletal morphogenesis in these different forms of the\nparasite.\nThis work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust and\nBBSRC.
