In the case of more general nonlinearities,\nincluding g(x) = x2 (describing the varactor equation), we find that there is at least one trajectory\nwhich describes a local attractor.\n1 Introduction\nConsider the ordinary differential equation\nx\u00a8+ \u03b3x\u02d9+ x2p+1 = f(\u03c9t), (1.1)\nwhere p \u2208 N, \u03c9 \u2208 Rd is the frequency vector, f(\u03c8) is an analytic quasi-periodic function,\nf(\u03c8) =\n\u2211\n\u03bd\u2208Zd\nei\u03bd\u00b7\u03c8f\u03bd , (1.2)\nwith average \u3008f\u3009 \u2261 f0 6= 0, and \u03b3 > 0 is a real parameter (dissipation coefficient). Here and henceforth\nwe denote with \u00b7 the scalar product in Rd. By the analyticity assumption on f there are two strictly\npositive constants F and \u03be such that one has |f\u03bd | \u2264 F e\u2212\u03be|\u03bd| for all \u03bd \u2208 Zd.\nIf d > 1 we shall assume a Diophantine condition on the frequency vector \u03c9, that is\n|\u03c9 \u00b7 \u03bd| \u2265 C0|\u03bd|\u2212\u03c4 \u2200\u03bd \u2208 Zd \\ {0}, (1.3)\nwhere |\u03bd| = |\u03bd|1 \u2261 |\u03bd1| + . . . + |\u03bdd|, and C0 and \u03c4 are positive constants, with \u03c4 > d \u2212 1 and C0 small\nenough. Note that for d = 1 the condition (1.3) is automatically satisfied for all \u03c9.\nIn this paper we want to show that for \u03b3 large enough the system (1.1) admits a global attractor\nwhich is a quasi-periodic solution with the same frequency vector \u03c9 as the forcing f . This will be done\nin two steps: first we prove that for \u03b3 large enough there is a quasi-periodic solution x0(t) with frequency\nvector \u03c9 (cf. Theorem 1 in Section 2); second we prove that, again for \u03b3 large enough, any trajectory is\nattracted by x0(t) (cf. Theorem 2 in Section 3).\nIn particular, this solves for the system (1.1) a problem left as open in [12]. Indeed in [12] we considered\na class of ordinary differential equations, including (1.1), and proved existence of a quasi-periodic solution\n1\nwith the same quasi-periodicity as the forcing, but we couldn\u2019t conclude, not even locally, that this was\nthe only solution with such a property. The result stated above gives an affirmative answer to this\nproblem for the system (1.1), by showing that the quasi-periodic solution x0(t) is unique; cf. Theorem 3\nin Section 4.\nThis uniqueness result holds for the more general systems studied in [12], including the resistor-\ninductor-varactor circuit, or simply varactor equation, described in [12, 4]. In that case the solution x0(t)\nis not a global attractor, but it turns out to be the only attractor in a neighbourhood of the solution\nitself.\nMore precisely the situation is as follows. We can consider systems described by\nx\u00a8+ \u03b3x\u02d9+ g(x) = f(\u03c9t), (1.4)\nwhere f is given by (1.2) and g is an analytic function. The case g(x) = x2 corresponds to the varactor\nequation studied in [4]. Studying the behaviour of the system (1.4) for \u03b3 large enough suggests to\nintroduce a new parameter \u03b5 = 1\/\u03b3, in terms of which the differential equation (1.4) becomes\n\u03b5x\u00a8+ x\u02d9+ \u03b5g(x) = \u03b5f(\u03c9t), (1.5)\nand study what happens for \u03b5 small enough.\nIf we assume that there exists c0 \u2208 R such that g(c0) = f0 and g\u2032(c0) := \u2202xg(c0) 6= 0, then the\nsystem (1.5) admits a quasi-periodic solution x0(t), analytic in t, with the same frequency vector \u03c9 as\nthe forcing f , and furthermore x0(t) = c0 + O(\u03b5). This was proved in [12], where the solution x0(t) was\nexplicitly constructed through a suitable summation of the perturbation series\nxP (t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03b5kx(k)(\u03c9t), x(k)(\u03c8) =\n\u2211\n\u03bd\u2208Zd\nei\u03bd\u00b7\u03c8x(k)\u03bd , (1.6)\nfor a function formally solving the equations of motion.\nAs a drawback of the construction we were not able to prove any uniqueness result about x0(t).\nIn fact, in principle, there could be other quasi-periodic solutions near x0(t), possibly with the same\nfrequency vector \u03c9. Neither could we exclude the existence of other solutions reducing to c0 as \u03b5\u2192 0 or\neven admitting the same formal expansion (1.6) in powers of \u03b5. In this paper, under the further positivity\ncondition g\u2032(c0) > 0, we eliminate these possibilities, and we prove that there exists, in the plane (x, x\u02d9),\na neighborhood B of the point (c0, 0) where (x0(t), x\u02d90(t)) is the only stable solution of (1.5). Moreover\nit turns out to be asymptotically stable, that is it attracts any trajectory starting in B. Therefore, this\nallows us to formulate a strengthened version of the theorem proved in [12]; cf. Theorem 4 in Section 4.\nIn general the neighbourhood B can be very small. In [2] we show that in specific cases, in particular\nin the case g(x) = x2, one obtains improved estimates of B.\nMore formal statements of the results will be formulated in the forthcoming sections. Some open\nproblems will be discussed at the end. Here we confine ourselves to noting that, while in the case of\nperiodic forcing standard techniques, like those based on Poincare\u00b4 sections [15, 18], could be applied, this\nis not the case for quasi-periodic forcing, where no Poincare\u00b4 maps can be introduced.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Sections 2 and 3 are devoted to the global study of\nthe system (1.1) for \u03b3 large enough, whereas in Section 4 we draw the conclusions. In Section 5 we pass\nto the study of the system (1.4), and we prove existence of a local attractor under the non-degeneracy\nconditions mentioned after (1.5). Finally, in Section 6 we mention some open problems, and possible\ndirections of future research.\n2 Existence of the quasi-periodic solution\nFirst we show that for \u03b3 large enough there exists a quasi-periodic solution x0(t). The proof of existence\nof a periodic solution in the case of periodic forcing is relatively easy, whereas in the case of quasi-periodic\n2\nforcing to prove existence of a quasi-periodic solution becomes a little more subtle. By using a formal\npower series expansion, as we do, we need to introduce a suitable summation of the series: this requires\na careful multiscale analysis and employs techniques of renormalisation group theory. The analysis is\nexplicitly performed in [12], and uses ideas and notions introduced first in [8] and exploited in [9, 11, 10]\nin similar contexts. The periodic solutions can be proved to be Borel summable at the origin [12];\nBorel summability also holds in the quasi-periodic case for two-dimensional frequency vectors of constant\ntype [13]. In [13] it is also shown that the results on the existence of periodic or quasi-periodic solutions\ncan be extended to any frequency vector which satisfies the Bryuno condition (weaker than the standard\nDiophantine condition (1.3) usually assumed).\nTheorem 1 Consider the equation (1.1), with f a non-zero average quasi-periodic function analytic in\nits argument and with \u03c9 satisfying the Diophantine condition (1.3). There exists \u03b30 > 0 such that for\nall \u03b3 > \u03b30 there is a quasi-periodic solution x0(t) with the same frequency vector as the forcing term.\nSuch a solution extends to a function analytic in 1\/\u03b3 in a disc D of the complex plane tangent to the\nimaginary axis at the origin and centered on the real axis. Furthermore, x0(t) = \u03b1 + O(1\/\u03b3), where\n\u03b1 = f\n1\/(2p+1)\n0\n6= 0.\nProof. We can apply the results of Section 7 in [12]. If we set g(x) = x2p+1, then g(c0) = f0 yields\nc0 = f\n1\/(2p+1)\n0\n, so that g\u2032(c0) 6= 0 as by assumption one has f0 6= 0. Both the existence of the analyticity\ndomain D and the form of the solution itself follow from the analysis in [12].\nIf \u03b3 is large enough, say \u03b3 > \u03b30 \u2265 \u03b30, then the solution x0(t) is of definite sign. In the following we\nshall assume that this is the case: hence x0(t) 6= 0 for all t \u2208 R.\n3 Convergence to the quasi-periodic solution\nGiven the quasi-periodic solution x0(t) one can write x(t) = x0(t)+\u03be(t), with \u03be(t) satisfying the differential\nequation\n\u03be\u00a8 + \u03b3\u03be\u02d9 + \u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) = 0, (3.1)\nwhere we have defined\nF (\u03be, x) :=\n1\n\u03be\n(\n(x+ \u03be)2p+1 \u2212 x2p+1) = 2p\u2211\nj=0\n(\n2p+ 1\nj\n)\n\u03be2p+1\u2212jxj . (3.2)\nWe can write (3.1) as {\n\u03be\u02d9 = y,\ny\u02d9 = \u2212\u03b3y \u2212 \u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)),\n(3.3)\nthat is z\u02d9 = \u03a6(z), if we define z = (\u03be, y) and \u03a6(z) = (y,\u2212\u03b3y \u2212 \u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)). We denote by \u03d5(t, z0) the\nsolution of (3.3) with initial datum z0. Define also P (\u03be, t) := F (\u03be, x0(t)) and Q(\u03be) := F (\u03be, \u03b1) and set\nR(\u03be, t) := P (\u03be, t)\/Q(\u03be).\nHere we prove the following result.\nTheorem 2 Consider the equation (3.1), with x0(t) the quasi-periodic solution of (1.1) given in Theorem\n1. There exists \u03b31 > 0 such that for all \u03b3 > \u03b31 all trajectories in phase space converge toward the origin\nas time goes to infinity.\nThe proof will pass through several lemmata.\nLemma 1 Assume \u03b3 > \u03b30 so that x0(t) exists and x0(t) 6= 0 for all t \u2208 R. There exist two positive\nconstants R1 and R2 such that R1 < R(\u03be, t) < R2 for all \u03be \u2208 R and for all t \u2208 R.\n3\nProof. By (3.2) we can write\nF (\u03be, x) = (2p+ 1)\n\u222b 1\n0\nds (x+ s \u03be)\n2p\n, (3.4)\nso that F (\u03be, x) \u2265 0 for all (\u03be, x) \u2208 R2. Moreover F (0, 0) = 0 and F (\u03be, x) > 0 for all \u03be \u2208 R if x 6= 0,\nand lim|\u03be|\u2192\u221e F (\u03be, x) = \u221e for all x \u2208 R. Hence for \u03b1 6= 0 and \u03b3 > \u03b30, one has both P (\u03be, t) > 0 and\nQ(\u03be) > 0, hence also R(\u03be, t) > 0 for all (\u03be, t) \u2208 R2. Moreover lim|\u03be|\u2192\u221eR(\u03be, t) = 1 for all t \u2208 R, so that\nthe assertion follows.\nLemma 2 Consider the equation (3.1), with x0(t) the quasi-periodic solution of (1.1) given in Theorem\n1. There exists \u03b32 > 0 such that for all \u03b3 > \u03b32 there is a convex set S containing the origin such that\nany trajectory starting inside S tends to the origin as time goes to infinity. One can take S such that\n\u2202S crosses the positive and negative y- and \u03be-axes at distances O(\u03b32) and O(\u03b32\/(p+1)) from the origin\nrespectively.\nProof. Rescale time through the Liouville transformation\n\u03c4 =\n\u222b t\n0\ndt\u2032\n\u221a\nR(\u03be(t\u2032), t\u2032), (3.5)\nwhich is well-defined by Lemma 1. Then, if we introduce the coordinate transformation \u03c8 : (\u03be, y) \u2192 (v, y)\nby setting \u03be(t) = v(\u03c4(t)) and y(t) =\n\u221a\nR(\u03be(t), t)w(\u03c4(t)), equation (3.3) is transformed into\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3v\n\u2032 = w,\nw\u2032 = \u2212 w\u221a\nR\n(\n\u03b3 +\nR\u2032\n2\n\u221a\nR\n)\n\u2212 v Q(v), (3.6)\nwhere primes denote differentiation with respect to \u03c4 , Q(v(\u03c4)) = Q(\u03be(t(\u03c4)) and R = R(v(\u03c4), t(\u03c4)) =\nR(\u03be(t(\u03c4)), t(\u03c4)).\nThe autonomous system {\nv\u2032 = w,\nw\u2032 = \u2212v Q(v), (3.7)\ncan be explicitly solved: all trajectories move on the level curves of the function\nH(v, w) =\n1\n2\nw2 +\n\u222b v\n0\ndv\u2032 v\u2032Q(v\u2032). (3.8)\nIn (3.6) one has R\u2032\/\n\u221a\nR = R\u02d9\/R, with R\u02d9\/R = P\u02d9 \/P \u2212 Q\u02d9\/Q, and it is easy to see (Appendix A) that there\nare two \u03b3-independent positive constants B1 and B2 such that\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 R\u02d92R\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < 1\u03b3 (B1 +B2|w|) . (3.9)\nIf \u03b3 satisfies \u03b32 > 2B1 we can define w\u02dc as\nw\u02dc =\n\u03b32 \u2212B1\nB2\n>\n\u03b32\n2B2\n, (3.10)\nso that \u03b3 := (\u03b3 +R\u2032\/2\n\u221a\nR)\/\n\u221a\nR > 0 for |w| \u2264 w\u02dc.\nConsider the compact set P\u02dc whose boundary \u2202P\u02dc is given by the level curve H(v, w) = w\u02dc2\/2 of the\nsystem (3.7). Such a curve crosses the w-axis at w = \u00b1w\u02dc = O(\u03b32) and the v-axis at v = O(\u03b32\/(p+1)).\nIf we take an initial datum (v(0), w(0)) \u2208 P\u02dc then the dissipation coefficient \u03b3 in (3.6), even if it changes\n4\nwith time, always remains strictly positive. Moreover H \u2032 = \u2212\u03b3w2 \u2264 0 and H \u2032 = 0 only for w = 0, and\nfor w = 0 the vector field in (3.6) vanishes only at v = 0, because Q(v) > 0 for all v (cf. the proof of\nLemma 1). Then we can apply Barbashin-Krasovsky theorem [1, 17], and conclude that the origin is\nasymptotically stable and that P\u02dc belongs to its basin of attraction.\nLet P(t) be the time-dependent preimage of P\u02dc under the transformation \u03c8. By Lemma 1 if \u03b3 is large\nenough there is a compact set S \u2282 P(t) for all t \u2208 R, such that the boundary \u2202S crosses the positive\nand negative y- and \u03be-axes at a distances of order \u03b32 and \u03b32\/(p+1) from the origin, respectively. All\ntrajectories starting from points inside S are attracted by the origin.\nLemma 3 Consider the curve g(\u03be, t) = \u2212\u03b3\u22121\u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) in the plane (\u03be, y). There exists \u03b33 > 0 such\nthat for \u03b3 > \u03b33, outside the set S defined in Lemma 2, one has\n\u2212 1\n2\u03b3\n\u03be2p+1 \u2265 g(\u03be, t) \u2265 \u2212 2\n\u03b3\n\u03be2p+1 (3.11)\nfor all t \u2208 R.\nProof. Consider \u03be \u2265 0 (the case \u03be < 0 can be discussed in the same way). By (3.2) one has\n\u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) = \u03be\n2p+1 +\n2p\u2211\nj=1\n(\n2p+ 1\nj\n)\n\u03be2p+1\u2212jxj0(t),\nand, if \u03b3 is sufficiently large so that |x0(t)| < 2|\u03b1|, then for \u03be \u2265 2|\u03b1| the sum can be bounded by\n22p+1(2|\u03b1|) \u03be2p \u2261 Cp\u03be2p. Hence one has\n1\n2\n\u03be2p+1 \u2264 \u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) \u2264 2\u03be2p+1, (3.12)\nas soon as \u03be \u2265 2Cp (note that if \u03be \u2265 2Cp then one has automatically \u03be \u2265 2|\u03b1|). Next, we want to show\nthat the latter inequality is satisfied outside S.\nConsider the intersection of the graph of g(\u03be, t) with \u2202S. Let II be the quadrant {(\u03be, y) \u2208 R2 : \u03be \u2265\n0, y < 0}; cf. figure 1. The curve \u2202S\u2229II is below the line\ny1(\u03be) = y0\n(\n1\u2212 \u03be\n\u03be0\n)\n, (3.13)\nwhere y0 := \u2212b\u03b32, with b > 0, is the y-coordinate of the point at which \u2202S crosses the y-axis, and\n\u03be0 := a\u03b3\n2\/(p+1), with a > 0, is the \u03be-coordinate of the point at which \u2202S crosses the \u03be-axis. On the other\nhand the graph of g(\u03be, t) in II is above the curve\ny2(\u03be) = \u2212 2\n\u03b3\n(\u03be + 2|\u03b1|)2p+1 , (3.14)\nbecause in (3.2) one has \u03beF (\u03be, x) \u2264 |x+ \u03be|2p+1 + |x|2p+1.\nAs a consequence in II the two curves \u2202S and g(\u03be, t) cannot cross each other for \u03be \u2208 (0, a\u03b3\u03b2\/2], with\n\u03b2 \u2264 2\/(2p+ 1). The latter assertion can be proved by reductio ad absurdum. First note that a\u03b3\u03b2 \u2264 \u03be0\nfor \u03b3 large enough. Suppose that there exists \u03be \u2264 a\u03b3\u03b2\/2 such that y1(\u03be) = y2(\u03be). Then one has\nb\n\u03b32\n2\n\u2264 b\u03b32\n(\n1\u2212 \u03be\n\u03be0\n)\n=\n2\n\u03b3\n(\n\u03be + 2|\u03b1|)2p+1 \u2264 4\n\u03b3\nmax{\u03be, 2|\u03b1|}2p+1 (3.15)\nthat is b\u03b33 \u2264 8 max{\u03be, 2|\u03b1|}2p+1, which is not possible if \u03b2 \u2264 2\/(2p+ 1) and \u03b3 is large enough.\nTherefore in II the graph of g(\u03be, t) can be outside S only for \u03be > a\u03b3\u03b2\/2, which is greater than 2Cp\nfor \u03b3 large enough. Hence (3.12) is satisfied outside S, so that (3.11) follows.\n5\ny0\n\u03be0\ny\n\u03be\ny1(\u03be)\ny2(\u03be)\n\u03be\n\u2202S\nFigure 1: Construction used in the proof of Lemma 3.\nLemma 4 Consider the equation (3.1), with x0(t) the quasi-periodic solution of (1.1) given in Theorem\n1. There exists \u03b34 > 0 such that for all \u03b3 > \u03b34, if z \/\u2208 S,then either \u03d5(t, z) enters S or crosses the y-axis\noutside S in a finite positive time.\nProof. Consider the four quadrants\nI = {(\u03be, y) \u2208 R2 : \u03be > 0, y \u2265 0}, II = {(\u03be, y) \u2208 R2 : \u03be \u2265 0, y < 0},\nIII = {(\u03be, y) \u2208 R2 : \u03be < 0, y \u2264 0}, IV = {(\u03be, y) \u2208 R2 : \u03be \u2264 0, y > 0}. (3.16)\nIn I one has \u03be\u02d9 \u2265 0, y\u02d9 < 0, in II one has \u03be\u02d9 < 0, in III one has \u03be\u02d9 \u2264 0, y\u02d9 > 0, and in IV one has \u03be\u02d9 > 0. It is\neasy to see that each trajectory starting in I enters II and each trajectory starting from III enters IV in\na finite time (see Appendix B).\nConsider now an initial datum z in II but not in to S. Let C1 be a continuous curve \u03be \u2192 y(\u03be) in II\nsuch that y\u02d9 < 0 for z in II above C1; cf. figure 2. Existence of such a curve follows from Lemma 3, which\nalso implies that C1 is decreasing outside S (see Appendix C). The curve C1 divides II into two sets IIa\nand IIb, with IIa above IIb. Denote by T1 and T2 the parts of IIa and IIb, respectively, outside S. Hence\nfor z \u2208 T1 the trajectory \u03d5(t, z) either enters S or enters T2. In the latter case it cannot come back to\nT1, hence y(t) \u2264 y, if (\u03be, y) = C1 \u2229 \u2202S. This means that if the solution does not enter S then it has to\ncross the vertical axis and enter III.\nAnalogously one discusses the case of initial data z in IV, outside S: their evolution leads either to S\nor to I. Hence the lemma is proved.\nLemma 5 Consider the equation (3.1), with x0(t) the quasi-periodic solution of (1.1) given in Theorem\n1. There exists \u03b35 > 0 such that for all \u03b3 > \u03b35 and for all z \/\u2208 S on the vertical axis, either \u03d5(t, z) enters\nS or the trajectory \u03d5(t, z) re-crosses the vertical axis at a point z1 which is such that |z| \u2212 |z1| > \u03b4 for\nsome positive z-independent constant \u03b4.\nProof. Fix an initial datum z \/\u2208 S on the vertical axis. This means that at t = 0 one has z = z(0) =\n(0, y(0)) outside S. Assume for concreteness y(0) > 0 and set y(0) = 1\/\u03b5p+1, with \u03b5 > 0. As z(0) \/\u2208 S\nthere exists a constant C2 such that \u03b3\n2\u03b5p+1 \u2264 C2. Consider the change of coordinates\nX = \u03b5\u03be, Y = \u03b5p+1y, T = \u03b5\u2212pt.

Note that Y (0) = 1 and XF (X, \u03b5x0(\u03b5\npT ) =\nX2p+1 +O(\u03b5X2p). Call S the image of S under the transformation (3.17); cf. figure 3.\nWe can rewrite the system (3.18) as{\nX \u2032 = Y,\nY \u2032 = \u03a8(X,Y ) \u2261 \u03a81(X,Y ) + \u03a82(X,Y ) + \u03a83(X,Y ),\n(3.19)\nwith \u03a81(X,Y ) = \u2212XF (X, \u03b5x0(0)), \u03a82(X,Y ) = \u2212X (F (X, \u03b5x0(\u03b5pT ))\u2212 F (X, \u03b5x0(0))), and \u03a83(X,Y ) =\n\u2212\u03b3\u03b5pY .\nIf we replace \u03a8(X,Y ) with \u03a81(X,Y ) in (3.19) the trajectory moves on the level curve \u0393 = {(X,Y ) \u2208\nR\n2 : H(X,Y ) = 1\/2} for the function\nH(X,Y ) =\n1\n2\nY 2 +\n\u222b X\n0\ndXXF (X, \u03b5x0(0)) (3.20)\nand crosses the vertical axis at the point (0,\u22121), hence at the same distance from the origin as at t = 0.\nBy Lemma 3 there exists in II a curve C2, decreasing outside S, such that \u2212\u03b3\u03b5pY \u2265 \u03a8(X,Y ) \u2265 \u2212\u03b3\u03b5pY\/2,\nfor Y in II below C2 (see Appendix C). Such a curve can be chosen in such a way that it crosses the level\ncurve \u0393 in a point P = (XP , YP ), with XP = 2D1(\u03b3\u03b5\np)1\/(2p+1), for some constant D1 (see Appendix C).\nNote that the time T1 necessary to reach such a point is of order 1.\nIf we take into account the component \u03a82(X,Y ) of the vector field in (3.19), we can move from P at\nmost by a quantity of order \u03b5p+1. Indeed, as long as the motion remains close to that generated by the\nvector field \u03a81(X,Y ), one has\n|F (X, \u03b5x0(\u03b5pT1))\u2212 F (X, \u03b5x0(0))| \u2264 D\u20322\u03b5 |x0(\u03b5pT1)\u2212 x0(0)| \u2264 D\u2032\u20322\u03b5p+1, (3.21)\nfor suitable positive constants D\u20322 and D\n\u2032\u2032\n2 , so that the points reached at time T1 by moving according\nto the vector fields \u03a81 and \u03a81 + \u03a82 cannot be more distant than D2\u03b5\np+1 for some constant D2. This\nfollows from the fact that the system is quasi-integrable, so that in a time of order 1 the action variable\ncan change at most by a quantity of order of the perturbation as bounded in (3.21); see Appendix D.\n7\nYX\n1\nC2\n\u2202S\nS\n\u22121\nP\nQ\nY (T3)\n\u0393\n(X(t), Y (t))\nFigure 3: Construction used in the proof of Lemma 5.\nFinally the component \u03a83(X,Y ) points inward along the full length of the curve \u0393. Define T2 as the\ntime at which the the trajectory of the full system (3.19) crosses the curve C2 in a point Q near P . Of\ncourse T2 is near T1, and so is of order 1, andX(T2) \u2265 XP \/2 by construction, while Y (T2) \u2265 YP\u2212D2\u03b5p+1,\nwith YP > \u22121.\nFrom time T2 onwards, we have {\nX \u2032 = Y,\nY \u2032 \u2265 \u2212\u03b3\u03b5pY\/2, (3.22)\nas long as the motion remains below C2. The latter property is easily checked to hold (see Appendix\nC). Then the trajectory crosses the vertical axis and meanwhile, at least, moves upward in the vertical\ndirection by a quantity \u03b3\u03b5pXP \/2 = D1\u03b3\u03b5\np(\u03b3\u03b5p)1\/(2p+1).\nTherefore when the trajectory again crosses the vertical axis, this happens at a time T3 such that\nY (T3) \u2265 YP \u2212 D2\u03b5p+1 + D1\u03b3\u03b5p(\u03b3\u03b5p)1\/(2p+1) > \u22121 + \u2206Y , with \u2206Y = D1\u03b3\u03b5p(\u03b3\u03b5p)1\/(2p+1) \u2212 D2\u03b5p+1 \u2265\nD2\u03b5\np+1, where the latter inequality holds provided (\u03b3\u03b5p)1+1\/(2p+1) \u2265 2D2\u03b5p+1, that is provided\n\u03b32(p+1) \u2265 D0\u03b5p+1, D0 = (2D2)2p+1. (3.23)\nSince \u03b5p+1\u03b32 \u2264 C2, inequality (3.23) is satisfied if \u03b32(p+1) \u2265 D0C2\u03b3\u22122, which requires \u03b32(p+2) \u2265 D0C2,\nthat is \u03b3 \u2265 (D0C2)1\/2(p+2), with D0 = (2D2)2p+1 Under this condition one has |Y (0)| \u2212 |Y (T3)| =\n1\u2212 |Y (T3)| \u2265 \u2206Y \u2265 D2\u03b5p+1, so that, in terms of the original coordinate y, one has |y(0)| \u2212 |y(t3)| \u2265 D2.\nThen, if the trajectory crosses the vertical axis once more in the positive direction (and this necessarily\nhappens if it does not enter S, by Lemma 4), this occurs at a time t4 such that |y(0)| \u2212 |y(t4)| \u2265 2D2,\nwhere we recall that the constant D2 is independent of the initial datum y(0). Simply one can repeat the\nargument above by taking (0, y(t3)) as initial datum and calling t4 the time of crossing of the positive\n8\n\u03be-axis. This means that the trajectory either enters S or, after a complete cycle, moves closer to the\norigin by a finite positive distance \u03b4 = 2D0.\nLemma 6 Consider the equation (3.1), with x0(t) the quasi-periodic solution of (1.1) given as in Theorem\n1. There exists \u03b36 > 0 such that for all \u03b3 > \u03b36 for all z \/\u2208 S there is a finite time t(z) such that\n\u03d5(t(z), z) \u2208 S.\nProof. Consider z \/\u2208 S. By Lemma 4 either \u03d5(t, z) enters S or there exists a time t1 such that \u03d5(t1, z)\nis on the vertical axis outside S. Hence, without loss of generality, we can consider only initial data\nz = (\u03be, y) outside S such that \u03be = 0. Assume y > 0 (if y < 0 the discussion proceeds in the same way):\nwe can apply Lemma 4 and we find that, as far as the trajectory does not enter S, at each turn it gets\ncloser to S by a finite quantity. Hence sooner or later it enters S.\nTheorem 2 follows from the lemmata above: it is enough to take \u03b31 = max{\u03b30, \u03b32, \u03b33, \u03b34, \u03b35, \u03b36}, so\nthat all lemmata apply.\n4 Uniqueness of the quasi-periodic solution\nLet \u03b3 be \u03b3 > max{\u03b30, \u03b31}. Then there exists a quasi-periodic solution x0(t) for the system (1.1), and\nsuch a solution is a global attractor.\nIn [12] we explicitly constructed a solution x0(t) with the properties stated in Theorem 1. Such a\nsolution turns out to be Borel summable for d = 1. In general the solution is obtained from the formal\nseries through a suitable summation procedure. Since Theorem 2 implies that if there exists a quasi-\nperiodic solution x0(t) this has to be unique, we can conclude that for real \u03b3 large enough there exists a\nunique quasi-periodic solution x0(t) with the same frequency vector as the forcing f . By setting \u03b5 = 1\/\u03b3,\nin the complex \u03b5-plane, there is a solution x1(t) which is analytic in a domain containing a disk D with\ncentre on the real axis and tangent at the origin to the imaginary axis. For real \u03b3 such a solution coincides\nwith x0(t) (as the latter is the only one), hence, by uniqueness of the analytic continuation, the function\nx1(t) is the only solution of (1.1) in all the domain D. In particular it is the only one which admits the\nformal expansion given by perturbation theory.\nWe can summarise the discussion above through the following statement.\nTheorem 3 Consider the equation (1.1), with f a non-zero average quasi-periodic function analytic in\nits argument and with \u03c9 satisfying the Diophantine condition (1.3). There exists \u03b30 > 0 such that for all\nreal \u03b3 > \u03b30 there is a unique quasi-periodic solution x0(t) with the same frequency vector as the forcing\nterm. Such a solution describes a limit cycle in the plane (x, x\u02d9) which is a global attractor.\nNote that the hypotheses made in Theorem 1 are more restrictive than those considered in [12]. In\nparticular we have excluded both polynomial nonlinearities and monomial nonlinearities with even degree.\nWe come back to this in the next section.\n5 Local attractors for more general nonlinearities\nIn the previous analysis, the restriction to monomials only resulted in a strictly positive function R(\u03be, t),\nwhich was used to construct the positively invariant set S. We leave as an open problem the study of\nwhat happens if the nonlinearity x2p+1 in (1.1) is replaced with\ng(x) =\n2p+1\u2211\nj=1\naj x\nj , aj \u2208 R, a2p+1 > 0. (5.1)\n9\nFor d = 1 and \u03b3 = 0 it is known that all motions are bounded, also replacing the constants aj with\nperiodic functions [6, 14, 5]. The same holds for d > 1 [16]. One could expect that the presence of friction\ntends to contract phase space toward some periodic solution (which certainly exists for \u03b3 large enough,\nas proved in [12]), but our results do not allow us to treat, in general, such a case.\nIf the nonlinearity x2p+1 is replaced with an even monomial x2p, with p \u2208 N, then, under the further\ncondition that f0 > 0, there is a quasi-periodic solution x0(t): again this follows from [12]. In such a case\nx0(t) is not a global attractor, as there are unbounded solutions; cf. for example [4] for p = 1. Still one\ncan prove that the solution found in [12] is unique, in the sense that it is the only attractor in a neighbour\nof the solution itself, and it is a local attractor. The same result holds, more generally, for any analytic\ng(x) in (1.4) such that g(c0) = f0 and g\n\u2032(c0) > 0 for some c0 \u2208 R. A more formal statement is as follows.\nTheorem 4 Consider the equation (1.4), with f , given by (1.2), and g both analytic in their arguments,\nand with \u03c9 satisfying the Diophantine condition (1.3). Assume that there exists c0 \u2208 R such that\ng(c0) = f0 and g\n\u2032(c0) := \u2202xg(c0) > 0. There exists \u03b30 > 0 such that for \u03b3 > \u03b30 there is a unique\nquasi-periodic solution x0(t) which has the same frequency vector as f , reduces to c0 in the limit \u03b3 \u2192\u221e,\nand extends to a function analytic in a disk with center on the positive real axis and boundary tangent\nto the vertical axis at the origin. Furthermore, there exists \u03b31 \u2265 \u03b30 such that for \u03b3 > \u03b31 there is a\nneighbourhood B of the point (c0, 0), containing the orbit described by x0(t), with the property that all\ntrajectories starting in B are attracted to the cycle described by x0(t) in the plane.\nProof. The existence of a quasi-periodic solution x0(t) with the same frequency vector \u03c9 as the forcing\nwas proved in [12]. As a byproduct of the proof, one can write x0(t) = c0 + x1(\u03c9t), with x1(\u03c8) analytic\nin \u03c8 and of order \u03b5, if \u03b5 = 1\/\u03b3 (that is for \u03b5 small enough one has |x1(\u03c8)| \u2264 C|\u03b5| for all \u03c8 and for a\nsuitable C). Therefore we can write x(t) = x0(t) + \u03be(t), where \u03be(t) satisfies the differential equation\n\u03be\u00a8 + \u03b3\u03be\u02d9 + \u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) = 0, (5.2)\nwith\nF (\u03be, x) =\n1\n\u03be\n(\ng(x+ \u03be)\u2212 g(x)\n)\n= \u2202xg(x) +O(\u03be). (5.3)\nThen we can write (5.2) as a system of first order differential equations,{\n\u03be\u02d9 = y,\ny\u02d9 = \u2212\u03b3y \u2212 \u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)),\n(5.4)\nand define R(\u03be, t) = F (\u03be, x0(t))\/F (\u03be, c0). It is easy to see that one has lim\u03be\u21920R(\u03be, t) = 1 +O(\u03b5), so that\nfor \u03b5 small enough one has R1 < R(\u03be, t) < R2, for two suitable positive constants R1 and R2.\nThen we can rescale time and variables by setting\n\u03c4 =\n\u222b t\n0\ndt\n\u221a\nR(\u03be(t\u2032), t\u2032), \u03be(t) = v(\u03c4(t)), y(t) =\n\u221a\nR(\u03be(t), t)w(\u03c4(t)), (5.5)\nwhich transforms the system (5.4) into\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3v\n\u2032 = w,\nw\u2032 = \u2212 w\u221a\nR\n(\n\u03b3 +\nR\u2032\n2\n\u221a\nR\n)\n\u2212 v F (v, c0),\n(5.6)\nwhere primes denote differentiation with respect to \u03c4 .\nIf we neglect the friction term in (5.6) we obtain the autonomous system{\nv\u2032 = w,\nw\u2032 = \u2212vF (v, c0)) = \u2212\u2202xg(c0) v +O(v2),\n(5.7)\n10\nwhich admits the constant of motion\nH(v, w) =\n1\n2\nw2 +\n1\n2\n\u2202xg(c0) v\n2 +O(v3), \u2202xg(c0) > 0. (5.8)\nHence the origin is a stable equilibrium point for (5.7), and the level curves for H are close to ellipses\nin a neighbourhood P\u02dc of the origin. It is easy to check that in P\u02dc the coefficient of the friction term is\nstrictly positive, for \u03b3 large enough, because R\u2032\/2\n\u221a\nR is (in P\u02dc) less than a constant. Hence we can apply\nBarbashin-Krasovsky\u2019s theorem and conclude that the origin is asymptotically stable and P\u02dc belongs to\nits basin of attraction. If we go back to the original variables (\u03be, y) we find that P\u02dc is transformed back to\na time-dependent set P(t). But the dependence on t of P(t) is very weak (as R is close to 1 for \u03b3 large\nenough), so that there exists a convex set S \u2282 P(t) for all t \u2208 R. Hence any trajectory starting from S\nis attracted toward the origin. In terms of the variables (x, y), using once more that the solution x0(t)\nis close to c0 within O(\u03b5), we can say that, for \u03b5 small enough (that is for \u03b3 large enough) there exists\na neighbourhood B of the point (c0, 0) such that it contains the cycle described by the quasi-periodic\nsolution x0(t) in the plane (x, x\u02d9), and any trajectory starting from B is attracted by such a cycle.\nIn particular the solution x0(t) is the only quasi-periodic solution which tends to c0 as \u03b5\u2192 0, and for\n\u03b5 > 0 small enough, say \u03b5 < \u03b50, it is the only one which admits the formal power expansion (1.6). Such\na solution was proved in [12] to be analytic in a domain D containing the interval (0, \u03b50), hence by the\nuniqueness of the analytic continuation, we can conclude that x0(t) is unique in all D.\nBy looking at the proof of Theorem 4, we see that it proceeds along the same lines of the proof of\nLemma 2 in Section 3. By using the definitions of [7], Theorem 4 says that the orbit described by x0(t)\nis an attracting set \u2013 and an attractor \u2013 with fundamental neighbourhood B. (Note however that in the\nextended phase space (x, x\u02d9, t) the attractor is not a bounded set, unlike the cases considered in [7]).\n6 Conclusions, extensions and open problems\nWe conclude with a list of open problems (some of which have already been mentioned in the previous\nsections).\nThe first one concerns possible extensions of the proof of Theorem 3 to the case of more general\npolynomials of the form (5.1). A natural question is: under what conditions is there still a global\nattractor, in these cases, when the dissipation coefficient is large enough?\nA characterisation of the set B can be given in some concrete cases, such as that of the varactor\nequation mentioned in Section 1. In [2] we show that we can improve the estimate by obtaining a set\nwhose size increases linearly in \u03b3 in the vertical direction, but in such a way that it is still expected to be\nstrictly included inside the actual basin of attraction. It would be worthwhile to attempt constructions\nof sets contained inside the basins of attraction that are as large as possible.\nWe also leave as an open problem for the varactor equation the proof that any bounded solution is\nattracted by x0(t). On the basis of numerical simulations, we conjecture that this is the case.\nAnother interesting problem is whether one can weaken the hypotheses on the function g, both for\ndetermining the existence of a quasi-periodic solution with the same frequency vector as the forcing and,\nin that case, for proving its uniqueness and attractivity.\nFinally, extensions to higher dimensional cases would be desirable.\nA Proof of (3.9)\nOne has P\u02d9 = \u2202\u03beP \u03be\u02d9 + \u2202tP and Q\u02d9 = \u2202\u03beQ \u03be\u02d9, so that\nP\u02d9\nP\n\u2212 Q\nQ\n=\n(\n\u2202\u03beP\nP\n\u2212 \u2202\u03beQ\nQ\n)\n\u03be\u02d9 +\n\u2202tP\nP\n=\n\u2202\u03beP \u2212 \u2202\u03beQ\nP\n+\n\u2202\u03beQ\nPQ\n(Q\u2212 P ) + \u2202tP\nP\n. (A.1)\n11\nOne can write\n\u2202tP =\n2p\u2211\nj=1\n(\n2p+ 1\nj\n)\nj\u03be2p+1\u2212jxj\u221210 (t) x\u02d90(t),\nQ\u2212 P =\n2p\u2211\nj=1\n(\n2p+ 1\nj\n)\n\u03be2p+1\u2212j (\u03b1\u2212 x0(t))j ,\n\u2202\u03beP \u2212 \u2202\u03beQ =\n2p\u2211\nj=1\n(\n2p+ 1\nj\n)\n(2p+ 1\u2212 j) \u03be2p\u2212j (x0(t)\u2212 \u03b1)j , (A.2)\nwhere x\u02d90(t) = O(1\/\u03b3) and x0(t)\u2212 \u03b1 = O(1\/\u03b3).\nFinally |x0(t)| \u2264 2|\u03b1| for all t \u2208 R if \u03b3 is large enough, and both \u03be2p+1\u2212j\/P and \u03be2p+1\u2212j\/Q tend to\nzero as \u03be \u2192\u221e for j \u2265 1. Hence (3.9) follows, with the constants B1 and B2 depending on p but not on\n\u03b3.\nB Initial data in I and III\nTake an initial datum z = (\u03be, y) in I. If y = 0 then \u03be\u02d9 = 0 and y\u02d9 = \u2212\u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) < 0, so that the trajectory\nenters II. If y > 0 then \u03be\u02d9 > 0 and y\u02d9 < 0.\nMoreover \u2202\u03be(\u03beF (\u03be, x)) = \u2202\u03be(x + \u03be)\n2p+1 = (2p + 1) (x + \u03be)2p \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 R, so that, by using the\nfact that \u03be(t) \u2265 \u03be(0) as long as (\u03be(t), y(t)) remains in I, one has in I\n\u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) \u2265 inf\nt\u2208R\n\u03beF (\u03be, x0(t)) \u2265 \u03be(0) inf\nt\u2208R\nF (\u03be(0), x0(t)) \u2265 c > 0, (B.1)\nwhere we used that F (\u03be, x) is strictly greater than a positive constant for x 6= 0 (see the proof of Lemma 1).\nTherefore we obtain\ny\u02d9 \u2264 \u2212\u03b3y \u2212 c, (B.2)\nwhich implies that y(t) reaches the \u03be-axis in a finite time.\nAnalogously one discusses the case of initial data z in III.\nC On the curves C1 and C2\nCall T the subset of II outside S.\nDefine C1 as a continuous curve in II such that in T it is given by the graph of the function \u03be \u2192\n\u2212\u03be2p+1\/4\u03b3. In (3.3) one can write y\u02d9 = \u03b3(\u2212y+ g(\u03be, t)), with g(\u03be, t) defined in Lemma 3. By Lemma 3, in\nT one has g(\u03be, t) \u2264 \u2212\u03be2p+1\/2\u03b3, so that at all points in T above C1 one has\n\u2212y + g(\u03be, t)) = |y|+ g(\u03be, t) \u2264 1\n4\u03b3\n\u03be2p+1 \u2212 1\n2\u03b3\n\u03be2p+1 \u2264 \u2212 1\n4\u03b3\n\u03be2p+1,\nhence y\u02d9 < 0.\nDefine C2 as a continuous curve in II such that in T it is given by the graph of the function \u03be \u2192\n\u22124\u03be2p+1\/\u03b3. By Lemma 3, one has g(\u03be, t) \u2265 \u22122\u03be2p+1\/\u03b3, so that in all points of T below C2 one has\ny \u2264 \u22124\u03be2p+1\/\u03b3 \u2264 2g(\u03be, t), hence \u2212\u03b3y \u2265 \u03b3(\u2212y+ g(\u03be, t)) \u2265 \u2212\u03b3y\/2, so that \u2212\u03b3y \u2265 y\u02d9 \u2265 \u2212\u03b3y\/2. In terms of\nthe rescaled variables (X,Y ) this yields Y \u2032 \u2261 \u03a8(X,Y ), with\n\u2212\u03b3\u03b5pY \u2265 \u03a8(X,Y ) \u2265 \u2212\u03b3\u03b5pY\/2, (C.1)\nas asserted after (3.20).\n12\nThe point P is given by the intersection of the curve Y1(X) = \u22124X2p+1\/\u03b3\u03b5p withe the level curve \u0393.\nHence\n1\n2\n=\n1\n2\n(\n4X2p+1P\n\u03b3\u03b5p\n)2\n+X F (X, \u03b5x0(0)) =\n24p+1\n\u03b32\u03b52p\nX4p+2P +X\n2p+1\nP +O(\u03b5X\n2p),\nhence XP = O((\u03b3\u03b5\np)1\/(2p+1)).\nNow consider the solution of (3.19) with initial datum Z(T2) = (X(T2), Y (T2)). We want to check\nthat the solution remains below C2 until it crosses the Y -axis. The solution of{\nX \u2032 = Y,\nY \u2032 = \u03a8(X,Y ),\n(C.2)\nwith \u03a8(X,Y ) satisfying the bounds (C.1), moves below the line with slope \u2212\u03b3\u03b5p passing through Z(T2),\nthat is below the line of equation Y = Y1(X) := Y0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b5pX , with Y0 determined by the request that\nfor X = X \u2261 X(T2) one has Y0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b5pX = \u22124X2p+1\/\u03b3\u03b5p, where the graph of \u22124X2p+1\/\u03b3\u03b5p describes\nthe curve C2 in the coordinates (X,Y ). By using that X is close to XP one realises that Y0 has to be\nnegative. In turn this implies that the line of equation Y = Y1(X) is below the curve C2, so that also the\nassertion after (3.22) is proved.\nD Variations in finite times for quasi-integrable systems\nThe system obtained from (3.19) by replacing \u03a8(X,Y ) with \u03a81(X,Y ) is an integrable Hamiltonian\nsystem, with Hamiltonian (3.20). For \u03b5 = 0 the Hamiltonian reduces to\nH0(X,Y ) =\n1\n2\nY 2 +\n1\n2p+ 2\nX2p+2, (D.1)\nwhich can be written in terms of the action-angle variables (I, \u03d5) as H0(X,Y ) = H0(I) = cpI(2n+2)\/(n+2),\nwhere cp is a suitable p-dependent positive constant. By taking into account the other terms of the vector\nfield, we obtain\nH(X,Y ) = H(I) = cpI(2n+2)\/(n+2) +O(I(2n+1)\/(n+2)). (D.2)\nThe equations obtained by adding to \u03a81(X,Y ) the vector field \u03a82(X,Y ) are still Hamiltonian, and are\ndescribed by the non-autonomous Hamiltonian H(I) +H1(I, \u03d5, t), with H0 given as in (D.2) and H1 of\norder \u03b5p+1 as long as the action variables remain of order 1.\nThe corresponding equations of motion are{\nI\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202\u03d5H1(I, \u03d5),\n\u03d5\u02d9 = \u03c90(I) + \u2202IH1(I, \u03d5),\nwith \u03c90(I) = \u2202IH0(I). Then one immediately realises that in a time of order 1 the action variables\nremain close to their initial values. In turn this implies that also the angle variables are changed by order\n\u03b5p+1 with respect their unperturbed values. In terms of the original coordinates (X,Y ) this means that\nthe solution remains within a distance O(\u03b5p+1) with respect the unperturbed value.\nReferences\n[1] E.A. Barbas\u02c7in, N.N.
