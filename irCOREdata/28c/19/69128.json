Introduction \nIn common with geographical inquiry more generally, questions of power have long \nbeen fundamental to research in economic geography.  For instance, investigations \ninto the fundamentally uneven nature of economic development point to the enduring \npower asymmetries between different places and actors within the global space \neconomy (see Storper and Walker, 1989).  Meanwhile, the extensive literature on \nworld and global cities has identified certain cities as particularly powerful actors in \nchoreographing the transnational flows of knowledge, people and capital that \ncharacterise the contemporary global economy (Beaverstock et al 2000; Sassen, \n2001).  However, whilst questions of power are implicitly central to these literatures, \npower has only rarely been placed centre stage.  This oversight has started to be \naddressed through an explicit focus on power by authors such as John Allen (2003) \nand in work beyond geography such as Stewart Clegg\u201fs (1989) research in \nManagement Studies. These developments have stimulated a more careful \nconsideration of power relations by economic geographers over recent years.  Indeed, \nthis renewed and explicit focus on questions of power is particularly evident in work \nthat develops relational and production network approaches to understanding uneven \neconomic development (see Yeung, 2005; Henderson et al 2002 respectively). \n \nInspired by this resurgence of explicit considerations of power within economic \ngeography, the papers in this Special Issue stem from two sessions organised at the \n2006 RGS-IBG Annual Conference in London. The aim of these sessions was to use \ndetailed empirical research from a range of geographic and economic contexts to \ndevelop understandings of power and the relationship between organisations, power, \nspace and place. Echoing this focus, in this Introduction we consider how \n2 \n \nunderstandings of power within economic geography, particularly from a relational \nperspective, have been developed to date.  We then consider the questions this raises \nfor research into the organizational geographies of power in the future.  We focus on \nwork in relational economic geography, including recent work on global production \nnetworks because, as we discuss in more detail below, these literatures have been \ncentral to the development of the theoretical foundations that facilitate more \nsophisticated analyses of power in economic organisations from a geographical \nperspective. \n \nWe develop our arguments over four further sections.  First, we consider the central \ninsights developed by recent theorisations of power within geography and the social \nsciences as they relate to our focus on organisations.  Second, we explore how these \nanalyses have been developed within relational economic geography.  Third, we \nprovide an example of how these analyses have been advanced by focusing on \neconomic geographical research into processes of neoliberalisation. Finally, we reflect \non the consequences of this development for economic geographers and other \nresearchers interested in the intersections between organisations, power, space and \nplace. \n \n2. Theorising the geographies of power  \nIn order to consider the study of power in an organisational context we take as our \nstarting point the work of Stewart Clegg (1989) and in particular his important \ndistinction between what power is and what power does.  Whilst these two facets are \nclearly co-constitutive, the distinction made by Clegg has significant consequences \nfor research agendas focused on the geographies of power in an organisational \n3 \n \ncontext.  Beginning then with questions of what power is, Clegg (1989) adopts a \nrelational approach and identifies three elements that combine to (re)produce power \nrelations.  First, he points to the importance of agency and the ways in which the \narticulations of actions, practices and points of resistance define power and its nature.  \nSecond, he draws attention to the structural dimensions of power in the form of the \ninstitutional and societal conditions that inform the behaviours and practices of these \nactors.  Third, he identifies the important role of organisations, understood as social \ncollectives, that can both benefit from and yet also enable the creation of power. This \nanalysis of power is instructive because, rather than conceiving of power as an \ninanimate \u201ething\u201f, Clegg\u201fs (1989) work provides an early example of the ways in \nwhich power can be understood as a two-way process with the relations between \nactors and structures forming the key unit of analysis. \n \nHowever, whilst Clegg\u201fs analysis is valuable for developing understandings of the \nways in which power relations are constituted in an organisational context, his work \nlacks an explicit focus on the geographical dimensions and implications of power.  In \nthis respect we turn to the seminal contribution of John Allen (2003).  Allen (2003) \ndraws attention both to the different forms that power takes and the variable spatial \nreaches associated with each form. In terms of our focus on the intersection between \norganisations, space, place and power, the distinction made between two types or \n\u201emodalities of power\u201f as synthesised by Allen (2003) is particularly important. \n \nThe first such modality identified by Allen (2003) is a \u201ecentred\u201f form or power in a \nLatourian (1986) sense.  This is an instrumental form of power that is held by certain \nactors and used by them over others.  As such, in this version, power is a \u201ething\u201f that \n4 \n \nis possessed by individuals who are deemed powerful by others by virtue of them \n\u201eholding\u201f power.  Allen (2003) argues that this form of power can be thought of as \n\u201epower as capacity\u201f such that actors can hold power but may or may not choose to use \nit.  Significantly, even when actors do not use their power, in this form of power, they \nare still widely regarded as being powerful.  In many respects, it is this type of power \nthat has implicitly at least dominated accounts of power in economic geography until \ncomparatively recently with certain actors being identified as being structurally \npowerful (following Clegg, 1989) and widely being seen as holding power and using \nit over other actors.  Examples would include the headquarters of a transnational \ncorporation (TNC), multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF as \nwell as particular places such as London as a leading financial centre. \n \nHowever, a second modality of power identified by Allen (2003) follows the insights \nof Clegg (1989) much more closely by focussing on how actors derive and reproduce \npositions of power for themselves within the global space economy.  Allen (2003) \nterms this \u2018power through mobilization\u2019.  He argues that this is a much more subtle \nversion of power that is reproduced relationally through networks, thereby focussing \nattention on \u201ehow power is produced in and through social interaction\u201f (Allen 2003: \n40).  This approach to power is heavily influenced by the work of Castells (1996) and \nFoucault (1982) and points to the ways in which power is not always a \u201ething\u201f that can \nbe held and deployed in a hierarchical sense. Rather, in this modality, power emerges \nthrough, and is inseparable from, social and economic actions and tactics designed to \nconstruct power where it might not already exist. Examples include attempts by a \nTNC to manufacture relations which allow control of a subsidiary when structural \n5 \n \npower relations are weak or do not exist because the subsidiary is financially and \norganisationally autonomous.  \n \nCrucially for our interest in the geographies of power, in this account of power Allen \n(2003) goes beyond Clegg\u201fs (1989) relational approach to consider the geographies of \n\u201epower through mobilization\u201f. Allen argues that power is a force that is dependent on \nhow different actors internalize meaning and are enrolled into the networks of others \nthrough their social practice.  Following work developing topological spatial \nimaginations (e.g. Amin, 2002), power is, therefore, not necessarily conceptualised as \nbeing restricted to one spatial scale but shown to typically cross cut and reproduce \nboth the local and the global depending on the practices associated with power \nthrough mobilization.  Indeed, in order to tease out the geographical implications of \nsuch networks, Allen (2003) argues that attention needs to be paid to the ways in \nwhich organisations are able to enrol other actors into their networks and reproduce \npositions of power by doing this since it is this net-work that determines the ways in \nwhich power \u201eflows\u201f geographically.  \n \nAllen (2003) clarifies this point by identifying a range of different forms of power that \nemerge depending on an actor\u201fs strategies and the way in which they mobilize \nstructural resources and enrol other actors into their aims.  Following Clegg\u201fs (1989) \nemphasis on what power is, Allen (2003) argues that the types of power that emerge \nthrough these practices include authority, coercion, domination, inducement, \nmanipulation and seduction.  Importantly, for our arguments here, each of these has \ndistinct geographies that derive from the ways in which power is mobilized.  For \nexample, Allen (2003) suggests that domination is usually mobilized by actors \n6 \n \noperating \u201efrom the centre\u201f, headquarters in a TNC for instance, whereas seduction or \ninducement may involve \u201emulti-level\u201f mobilizations involving spatially dispersed \nactors, in multiple subsidiaries of a TNC as well as at headquarters for example. This \nsuggests certain forms of power may \u201etravel\u201f better than others, with domination \nexercisable at a distance whereas authority or seduction might require negotiations \nbetween co-present parties. Hence the geographies of power for Allen are topological, \ndetermined by the type of power at work and the geographies and practices of the \nactors mobilizing this power.       \n \nThis clearly has implications for the second question posed by Clegg (1989) \u2013 what \ndoes power do? It suggests that power does different things depending on how the \nmodalities of power and their spatiality lead to the construction of different forms of \npower relations that are grounded differently as power mobilizations are worked out \nin different places. To date geographers have tended to emphasise the negative \nimpacts of power.  Power is frequently seen as something used for exploitation or to \nforce other actors to behave in a way against their will.  For example, this can be seen \nin early work on the core-periphery model as well more recent accounts of the power \nof neo-liberal organisations such as the IMF. This is clearly an important element of \npower but, by adopting a relational understanding of the multiple modalities of power, \nit is possible to consider how power can also be a positive force and act as an enabler \nfor more \u201ejust\u201f economic development.  Examples here, although modest in their \ninfluence, would include modalities of power \u201eworked out\u201f in supply chain changes \nand associated with the growth of the fair trade movement (Clarke et al 2007) or the \npower consumer activists have had over the exploitation of workers in sweatshops. \n \n7 \n \nOne of the main remaining challenges is, then, to couple these theoretical \ndevelopments in understandings of power with empirical analysis of the nature and \neffects of power relations.  This special issue aims to begin to tackle this challenge by \ndrawing on work in \u201erelational economic geography\u201f and \u201eproduction network \napproaches\u201f (see Boggs and Rantisi, 2003; Henderson et al 2002 respectively).  As \nsuch, in the rest of this introductory paper we consider what can be learned from \ninterrogating the relational geographies of power that are central to contemporary \neconomic life through these literatures and how this might re-orientate future research \nin economic geography. \n \n3. Relational approaches to the spatialities of power \nRelational approaches begin with the belief that understanding the spatiality of \neconomies requires a balanced analysis of both structures and agency because \n\u201cEconomic decisions and their consequences are always shaped by the structure of \nsocial relations with other actors and shared institutional conditions\u201d (Bathelt and \nGl\u00fcckler, 2005, 1546). Similarly, the global production networks approach \nemphasises the importance of conceptualising the networks that underlie economic \nactivity as \u201cboth structural and relational. Networks are structural in that the \ncomposition and interrelation of various networks constitute structural power \nrelations, and they are relational because they are constituted by the interactions of \nvariously powerful social actors\u201d (Dicken et al., 2001, 94, original emphasis). In \nterms of power, both approaches draw on the work of Allen (2003) outlined above \nand emphasize the importance of research that seeks to \u201cunpack what power is in \nrelational terms, but more importantly also to demonstrate how heterogeneous \nconfigurations of power relations (i.e. relational geometries) can generate certain \n8 \n \nemergent effects\u201d (Yeung, 2005, 6). As such, relational and production network \napproaches implicitly take into account the importance of studying both what power is \nand what it does through a focus on the spatiality of social action and interaction.  Put \nbroadly, in terms of what power is, these literatures emphasise power as a form of \nmobilized,  spatialized social interaction and negotiation.  Meanwhile, in terms of \nwhat power does, they emphasise how power (constructed) through mobilization has \nspatially contingent effects in terms of change, control or inequality. Both of these \nissues and the way the relational and production network approaches deal with them \nare explored below.  \n \n3.1 What power is and does: practice and situated mobilizations \n \nIn terms of the modalities of power, the relational and production network approaches \nemphasise: first, the organisational practices, strategies and negotiations that a range \nof economic actors deploy to render ideas, values or positions powerful and \ninfluential; second, how such practices are \u201ereceived\u201f by network relations; and, third, \nthe spatially and temporally variable nature of the first and second. As a result, it is \nstressed that \u201cEach of the major sets of actors in the global economy is involved in \nboth cooperation and collaborations on one hand and in conflict and competition on \nthe other\u2026Such apparently paradoxical behaviour should warn us against assuming \nthat relationships between certain actors are always of one kind\u2026these various actor-\nnetworks are imbued with an ever-changing mixture of both kinds of relationship\u201d \n(Coe et al., 2008, 18).  Spatially, such an approach echoes Allen\u201fs (2003) call for \nresearch into power relations to invoke a topological imaginary that appreciates \nrelational forms of spatiality so as to avoid local fetishes in which metric forms of \n9 \n \nproximity are considered most influential (see also Amin 2002; Massey 2005).  \nRelational economic geography, therefore, emphasises the multiple connections and \nentanglements that actors draw on as part of attempts to exercise and construct forms \nof power. Such a topological imaginary recognises the always contingent and multiple \nentanglements and networks of social practice that makeup different modalities of \npower and which lead to spatially and temporally different outcomes both in terms of \nthe nature of power and its effects. \n \nIn order to understand the tactics deployed by organisations as part of attempts to \nconstruct and exercise power through such relational networks and the ensuing \n\u201ecooperation, collaboration and conflict\u201f, Jones (2008) suggests that we adopt a \npractice-based approach (see also Faulconbridge, 2007). For Jones, a focus on \npractice means a focus on what people do and the way this is influenced by \n\u201cconventional economic factors (price, costs etc.), and also unconventional ones \n(organizational culture, personal friendships, social norms)\u201d (Jones, 2008, 79).  This is \nimportant because it allows the complex social constructions associated with, in \nparticular, power through mobilization to be unpicked. In addition, a practice-based \napproach helps avoid analyses that neglect spatiality because it focuses explicitly on \nthe multiple spatial entanglements that help define what actors do and the strategies \nadopted. \n      \nUnderstanding \u201ewhat power is\u201f using a practice-based approach whilst emphasising \nmicro-scale social action does, however, have some dangers. First, a practice-based \napproach should not neglect the influence of structure. Power relations may in part \ndraw on forms of resource-based power. Structural influences may be the preeminent \n10 \n \nform of power-relation in some organizations (e.g. a TNC in which financial \nstructures given headquarters control of each subsidiaries resources). Second, a \npractice-based approach should also be sure not to neglect the question of what power \ndoes. Indeed, one of the greatest dangers of a practice-based approach is that it can \ntell us much about what different actors do, how they interact and the collaborations \nand conflicts that go on as part of the modalities of power, but little about the long-\nterm impacts. However, this need not be the case so long as we trace through how \ncollaboration or conflict leads to change in the short-, medium- or long-term. In fact, \nif both structure and its influence on power and the impacts of what power does are \nincorporated, the practice-based approach provides one of the most powerful tools for \nexplaining the way power relations work and what they do rather than just identifying \nwhen power relations cause change, inequality or other effects. This means using the \npractice-based approach to look at the exploitation of structural power, the strategies \nadopted by actors as part of mobilizations of power, but at the same time also using it \nto tease out the way spatially contextual variables influence the internalization and \nenrolment process associated with mobilizations and reactions to all forms of the \nexercise of power, collaborative or conflictive, because this will help us understand \nthe impacts of these reactions on what power actually does.  \n \nTo highlight the value of this argument it is worth considering examples of the way \ngeographers have already developed such ideas. As Allen (2003) sets out, the idea of \nmobilizations of power is drawn from the work of Foucault (1980) on \ngovernmentality with discourse being one technique associated with the construction \nof subjectivities, i.e. the internalization of ideas and enrolment of actors leading to the \nconstruction of power relations. It is to questions of discourse and power that we, \n11 \n \ntherefore, now turn as part of further consideration of how economic geographers \nhave conceptualised power to date. \n \n4. Spatialities of power and discourse: the case of neoliberalization \nEconomic geographers have extensively explored the way discourse has been used to \n\u201egovern\u201f different actors (see for example Coe and Kelly, 2002; Kelly, 2001; Wong \nand Bunnell, 2007, Larner, 2007).  Here we focus on one strand of this work \u2013 on \nneoliberalism - which reveals the value of analyses that prioritise agency by \nconsidering the practices of power, the spatial influences on the social negotiations \ninvolved in power through mobilization and the ultimate impact of such power \nrelations.   \n \nIn relation to neoliberalism, there is now an expansive body of work which reveals the \nway neoliberal logics have been \u201erolled-out\u201f as part of discursive strategies which \nseek to convince different governments and other actors of the legitimacy of post-\nKeynesian economic policies (see Larner, 2000; Peck and Tickell, 2002). Here we can \nonly summarise the arguments put forward in existing work in relation to questions of \nthe modalities of power. We focus on three of the most important insights. First, in \nrelation to the modalities of power, the practices of agents promoting neoliberalism \nhave been shown to be associated with forms of governmentality that seek to \nreproduce particular identities and understandings of economic regulation. As Larner \n(2000, 14) notes, this means studying the \u201emessy actualities\u201f of the way different \nagents seek to construct both themselves and their logics positions of power in \nrelations with governments and others that they wish to convert to neoliberal \ndoctrines. Moreover, as Peck and Tickell (2002, 393) suggest, this means analysing \n12 \n \n\u201eactualities\u201f which are made up of \u201cwebs of interlocal and interorganizational \nrelations\u201d. So understanding how neoliberal logics and actors gain power actually \nrequires study of the spatialities of the practices of those actors and the resultant \nentanglements that influence those practices. These entanglements or networks reach \ntrans-locally as the logic of neoliberalism and the strategies that underlie its power \ndraw from connections that reach across scales and which draw on the structural \ninfluence of organizations such as the World Bank and particular states but also the \ndiscursive value of insights from think-tanks, academics, business schools and \nconsultants (Dezalay and Garth, 2002; Swain, 2006). Understanding how such \nspatially diverse networks of association render neoliberalism powerful has been \ncentral to explaining its worldwide travels.   \n \nSecond, work on neoliberalism has shown the importance of studying the spatiality of \nthe interactions associated with the exercising and mobilization of power\u2013 i.e. \ninteractions at a distance or in situ \u2013 and the outcomes of variations in the spatiality of \nthese interactions.  This follows Allen\u201fs (2003) argument that different forms of \npower \u201etravel\u201f better than others. As Larner (2000, 6) argues, those promoting \nneoliberalism have developed a number of strategies which have effectively overcome \nthe difficulties of constructing power relations at a distance and exercising their \ninfluence across space. As she writes, \u201cNeoliberalism is both a political discourse \nabout the nature of rule and a set of practices that facilitate the governing of \nindividuals from a distance\u201d. However, other tactics are associated with power \nrelations that rely on in situ, face-to-face encounters. For example, Swain (2006) \nshows how travelling experts rely not on discursive strategies but more structural \nforms of power (i.e. their legitimacy as role models from the heartlands of \n13 \n \nneoliberalism). Hence this suggests that it is essential that we analyse how particular \nmodalities of power relate to particular spatialities as part of attempts to recognise \nthe heterogeneity in modalities, forms, spatial reach and effects of power relations.  \n \nThird, work on neoliberalism also reveals how, when all forms of power are \nexercised, they are affected by geographically contingent agency and structure which \nare inseparable. One of the main contributions of geographical work on neoliberalism \nhas been to reveal the constantly mutating, reforming and geographically variable \nnature of neoliberal projects. For example, discourse-based power relations that allow \ncontrol at a distance lead to different outcomes when the agents constructing and \nexercising this power interact with agents in different places that are part of situated \nnetworks of association.  Moreover these interactions influence the internalization and \nenrolment associated with discursive power and ultimately the effects of power \nrelations. As Brenner and Theodore (2002, 368) argue: \n\u201cit is important to underscore that the processes of neoliberal localization\u2026unfold in \nplace-specific forms and combinations within particular local and national contexts. \nIndeed, building upon the conceptualization of actually existing neoliberalism \ndeveloped here, we would argue that patterns of neoliberal localization in any \nnational or local context can be understood adequately only through an exploration of \ntheir complex, contested interactions with inherited national and local regulatory \nlandscapes\u201d. \n \nThis reveals, then, the importance of structures alongside agency with place-specific \nstructures - in the case of neoliberalism ranging from incumbent institutional regimes \nof governance and economic regulation to already existing discourses relating to \n14 \n \nwelfare or employment - influencing what power does in any one place at any one \ntime. \n \n5. Developing organisational geographies of power \nBased on this brief discussion of the way power has been theorised in relation to \nrelational economic geographical approaches and work on neoliberalism, four \ninterrelated issues emerge that need considering in any attempt to better theorise \norganisational geographies of power. We exemplify these points with reference to the \nwork of TNCs from a relational economic geography perspective but the arguments \nare equally valid for other types of organization operating at national or international \nscales. \n \nFirst, it is important to examine the practices associated with power through \nmobilization and, in an organizational context, the different actors involved in \ndeveloping and deploying such practices. So, for example, in a transnational \ncorporation, who is involved in attempts to control, from a distance, subsidiaries and \nwhat strategies do these actors develop to do this? Second, it is important to examine \nthe spatiality of the networks that influence these practices and the different \nassociations, that may well transcend scales and organizational boundaries, which \nhelp construct positions of power. In a TNC, how do UK-based actors\u201f strategies to \ncontrol a subsidiary in Spain draw on insights gained from business schools in the US, \nthe approach of a rival firm based in Germany, the experience of another manager in \nthe firm\u201fs Singapore subsidiary and the personal relationships of a manager in the \nSpanish subsidiary with a colleague based in the UK?  Third, it is important to \nconsider the spatiality of the exercising of power. This implies a focus on questions \n15 \n \nabout the differing roles of control at a distance (virtually) and control through \nproximity (in person), their relationship to different modalities of power and their \ndiffering effects. Why, how and with what effects does discourse get used by actors \noperating at a distance (through documents and telephone calls) as part of control \nthrough coercion whilst instructions are given only by actors in proximity (face-to-\nface) as part of control through authority? Fourth, it is essential to consider how the \neffects of power are determined by the way the enrolment of agents who internalise \nmeanings is influenced by situated structures. Why and how do workers in the \nSpanish subsidiary react differently to workers in the Italian subsidiary when either \ndiscourse or instruction are used to encourage participation in training events deemed \nimportant by the firm?  \n \nEach of the papers in this special issue begins to address some of these questions \nthrough empirical analysis of a range of economic sectors and geographical contexts.  \nIn her paper, Sally Weller considers how different modalities, spatialities and scales \nof power were articulated during the collapse of one of Australia\u201fs leading airlines, \nAnsett Airlines.  In addition to positioning transport firms more centrally within \neconomic geographical analysis, her work points to the importance of considering the \nmultiple and relational positioning of economic agents within networks in order to \nconsider both the reproduction of power relations and their effects.  Moreover, her \ncase study also identifies the role of the state as an actor in shaping organisational \ngeographies of power.  Faulconbridge et al.\u2019s paper shifts both the geographical \ncontext and theoretical focus of the special issue by exploring how executive search \nfirms in Europe have carved out a powerful position for themselves in both corporate \nlabour management processes and within elite labour markets more generally.  Their \n16 \n \nanalysis points to the discursive strategies utilised by headhunting firms to achieve \nthis and the geographical consequences as individuals seek to obtain positional \nadvantage within such labour markets by emphasising their geographical \ndifferentiation.  Meanwhile, Jones and Search focus on the geographical construction \nof power relations within the UK-based private equity industry.  Their analysis \nfollows recent work in relational economic geography to identify different forms of \nproximity that are important in reproducing power relations ranging from cultural, \nthrough virtual to organizational proximity. \n \nTaken together, these papers provide clear examples of the value of adopting a \nrelational and practice based approach in order to develop further understandings of \nthe complex relationship between questions about what power is and does, the tactics \nof organisations, and space and place. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe sessions that the papers which make up this special issue were drawn from at the \n2006 RGS-IBG Annual Conference were kindly sponsored by the Economic \nGeography Research Group.
