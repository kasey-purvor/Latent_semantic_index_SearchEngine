Transformative \nefforts to \u2017Reinvent Government\u2018 (Osborne and Gaebler 1992) in the United States (US) and \n\u2017modernize public services\u2018 (Newman 2001) in the United Kingdom (UK) are exemplary of \npolicies seeking to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of public-service delivery.  In \npursuit of this aim, policies addressing the structures of public-service delivery\u2014the way public \nservices are organized\u2014have accompanied policies addressing the agency of public servants\u2014the \nskills and attributes of the individuals employed in public services.  Often, these two approaches \nto public-service reform are seen as mutually dependent.  Organizational reforms may give rise to \nnew roles necessitating new skills sets; the broadening of public service staff\u2018s skills may in turn \nallow them to act more dynamically and autonomously in identifying opportunities for service \nimprovement and acting upon them. \nThis apparent synergy between structural reconfigurations and upskilling individuals as \nagents of reform, however, is not always so straightforward in practice.  Many commentators \nhave noted the contradictions inherent in certain organizational changes within the public \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n2 \nservices, and the inhibitive effect these have on the possibilities for collaboration and joined-up \nservice provision in reformed public services.  In particular, there is the well documented tension \nbetween hierarchies, markets and networks.  The collaborative network, as an organizing \nprinciple for public-service provision which might bridge gaps between state agencies and assist \nin addressing social problems that defy the efforts of a single agency (Jennings and Ewalt 1998; \nProvan and Sebastien 1998; Huxham and Vangen 2000), clashes with traditional top-down \nhierarchical organizational forms, and with the increasingly prominent role of markets and quasi-\nmarkets in national contexts subject to the Anglo-American influence (Hood et al. 2000; Ferlie et \nal. 2003; Currie and Suhomlinova 2006).  In the UK, a policy focus on networks has coexisted \nwith the reinforcement of a hierarchical performance-management regime and the increasing \nmarketization of public-service provision, mirroring developments elsewhere (Kickert and \nKoppenjan 1997; Tenbensel 2005).  \nIn this paper we empirically examine the degree of convergence (or otherwise) between a \nparticular structural reform\u2014the centrally mandated network\u2014and a particular facet of individual \nagency\u2014leadership of change\u2014which have both been central to government reform policies, in \nthe UK and elsewhere.  Networks and leadership have been advocated as means of reinvigorating \nstate-run services, especially in the US, the UK, and developed-world countries subject to Anglo-\nAmerican influences such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand (Kickert et al. 1997; O\u2018Toole \n1997; Shortell et al. 2000; Agranoff and McGuire 2001; Hennessey 1998; Kakabadse et al. 2003).  \nIn theory, leadership and networks should complement each other, with the looser organization \nand less hierarchical ordering logic of the network allowing leadership of change, distributed \namong network members rather than led from a single organizational apex, to flourish.  This \nwould affirm the findings of Denis et al. (1996) on the potential of distributed leadership in \ncomplex organizations with plural, ambiguous aims (cf. Bryson and Kelley 1978).  In practice, as \nwe set out in the sections that follow, this may not be the case.  Moreover, as we explore in the \nempirical section of this paper, in the ever more complex and unstable context of networks in the \nNational Health Service (NHS) in England,1  both the possibilities of distributed leadership and \nthe barriers it faces are increasing.  Drawing on a wider comparative study of the implementation \nof pilot cancer-genetics services in the NHS, we focus on the divergent courses of two case-study \nsites in which similar service reforms were introduced, highlighting the importance of differences \nin network organization and leadership style, and both the synergies and incongruities between \nthese.  Our analysis suggests that in itself, the structural reform of the network does little to \nachieve public-service reconfiguration.  It does, however, create a \u2017space\u2018 within which a certain \nenactment of leadership might be effective in linking diverse actors across organizational \nboundaries in pursuit of joint agenda.  To the extent that the network competes with other \norganizational forms and modes of governance, however, this space is a constricted one; \nconsequently there are limits to the effectiveness of the leaders and their agency, at the points \nwhere the network overlaps with other organizational forms (hierarchies and markets), which \nhave their own norms of influence and authority which differ from those which are effective \nwithin the network. \nWe continue first by reviewing the policy and academic literature on networks and \nleadership, before describing the specific empirical field in which our study was located.  We then \npresent our methods and findings, before discussing the theoretical and policy implications of \nthese. \n                                                 \n1 We refer throughout this paper to the public services in England only, since policies in the \ndevolved administrations of the other three nations of the United Kingdom have diverged \nsignificantly from English public-service reforms, particularly in relation to health-service \nreorganization. \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n3 \nNetworks and leadership: theory and policy in the public services \nThe increasing attention paid to the role of networks and leadership in public administration has \nits roots in the waves of reforms to public services over recent decades often grouped under the \nheading \u2017New Public Management\u2018 (Ferlie et al. 1996; Peters and Pierre 1998; Hood and Peters \n2004).  Though all characterized by efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public \nservices, these reforms were heterogeneous in nature.  The evolution of the approach, \nexemplified in approaches such as \u2017Reinventing Government\u2018 and \u2017modernization\u2018 that aim for a \nmore totalizing, transformative effect on public services, has precipitated an increasing need for \nnew organizational forms and new forms of leadership.  As Ferlie et al. (1996: 13) have it, this \nmodel of New Public Management that emerged from the 1990s onward moves away from \nhierarchical forms and leadership approaches towards \u2015new management styles, such as \nmanagement by influence; an increased role for network forms of organization; stress on strategic \nalliances between organizations as a new organizational form.\u2016  Collaborative organizational \nforms and associated new forms of leadership have gained currency among governments of many \ndeveloped-world countries (Scharpf 1993; Provan and Milward 1995; Kickert et al. 1997; Rhodes \n1997; Agranoff and McGuire 2003; Hall and O\u2018Toole 2004; Meier 2004).  In the UK, the public-\nservice network has been seen as a means of \u2017joining up\u2018 service provision even as hierarchy and \nmarket have remained, and indeed been strengthened, as modes of governance.  Though the \nnotions of the intra- and inter-organizational network are founded in the private sector (see \nNohria and Eccles 1992; Reed 1992), there is a growing literature on their role in public-service \nprovision (Provan and Milward 1995; Ferlie and Pettigrew 1996; O\u2018Toole 1997; Peters and Pierre \n1998; Rashman and Hartley 2002).  Private-sector networks are largely explained in terms of \nreduced transaction costs and interdependence between firms, but for public-service \norganizations, network-level outcomes for clients are additionally seen as a motivation for \nintegration (Provan and Sebastian 1998).  In the literature, moreover, networks are seen as more \nflexible and adaptable in the face of organizational turbulence, as opposed to hierarchies which \norient towards stability (Thompson et al. 1991), though empirical evidence for this is not strong \n(Bate 2000; Rashman and Hartley 2002). \nNetworks have had a particular appeal for policymakers under \u2017new Labour\u2018 governments \nin the UK since 1997, as an adaptable organizational form which combined the dynamism of the \nmarket with the co-ordination of the hierarchy in delivering the \u2017modernization\u2018 of public \nservices.  By facilitating joined-up working across professional and organizational boundaries, and \nby assisting the sharing of knowledge, good practice might be translated into rapid service \nimprovement, spread across the public services. As we will see in the next section, though, the \nreality of the implementation and practice of organizational networks is not quite so \nstraightforward. \nAlongside this focus on the reconfiguration of organizations and the relationships between \nthem, efforts at public-service reform have also been based on complementary attempts to \ntransform the workforce and its capacities: empowering public-service employees to act \nintelligently and autonomously within the enabling structures of networked organizations to \neffect change.  The \u2017Reinventing Government\u2018 initiative of the Clinton-led administration of the \nUS is exemplary of the expectations placed on this synergy, as a means of \u2015[changing] the culture \nof our national bureaucracy away from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and \nempowerment.\u20162  In the UK, new Labour\u2018s ambitions for \u2017modernization\u2018 similarly envisaged a \npublic-service workforce empowered to act intelligently and autonomously to effect change \nwithin the new organizational forms (Currie et al. 2005). \nWithin such policies, \u2017leadership\u2018 has been an ongoing emphasis.

The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n4 \nthe private sector has tended to give precedence to transformational leadership, embodied in a \nsingle, heroic figure at the apex of an organization, as both a subject of study and a prescription \nfor effectiveness (Bryman 1992; 1999).  Such norms and ideals of leadership have to some extent \npermeated public-service leadership policy (Currie et al. 2005), but there is recognition also \n(among academics and policymakers) of the limits to this model in the more pluralistic and \npolitical context of the public services.  For Heifetz (1994), leadership theory premised on the \nidea of a single inspirational leader is inapplicable to the public services, and attempts to \nconceptualize public-service leadership in this way serve only to perpetuate this myth.  Rather, \nleadership is about \u2017adaptive work\u2018 which requires buy-in and enactment by individuals at all \nlevels of an organization.  In the policy and practice of leadership in the public services, then, \nthere is an onus on distributed leadership, \u2015from apex to front line\u2016 (Hartley and Allison 2000, 39), \neven as power and responsibility are formally concentrated in the roles of the heads of public-\nservice organizations.  Arguably, the need for distributed leadership is all the more pronounced in \npublic-service networks, since \u2015the notion of a leader with a hierarchical relationship to followers \ndoes not apply in collaborations, so the potential for exercising \u2017decisive leverage\u2018 by virtue of a \nformal position is reduced\u2016 (Huxham and Vangen 2000, 1167; cf. O\u2018Toole 1997).   \nWhilst the need for an understanding of leadership as distributed within public-service \norganizations, and especially networks, is accepted, exactly what constitutes distributed leadership \nis less obvious, and the subject of ongoing clarification in the literature.  Van Wart (2005) offers a \ntypology of distributed leadership, variously emphasizing the deliberate delegation of leadership \nfrom the top down through \u2017substitutes for leadership\u2018 and \u2017superleadership\u2018, and the more \n\u2017organic\u2018 growth of \u2017self-leadership\u2018 and \u2017self-managed teams\u2018.  In all cases, though, shared \nleadership ultimately requires both a willingness to cede leadership to others on the part of \norganizational heads, and the capacity of other actors to take it on (van Wart 2005, 372-3).  As \nCrosby and Bryson (2005, 29) suggest, \u2015potential for effective leadership lies alike with those who \ndo and do not have formal positions of power and authority.  Indeed, this view of leadership may \nbe most useful in reminding those with little authority how powerful they can be through \ncollaboration [\u2026] and in reminding those in a supposedly powerful position just how much they \nrely on numerous stakeholders for any real power they have.\u2016 \nThus even if we accept Bennett et al.\u2018s (2003, 7) notion of distributed leadership as \u2015the \nproduct of concertive or conjoint activity, [\u2026] an emergent property of a group or network,\u2016 it is \nimportant to recognize that such emergence occurs within the boundaries set by other parties, \nincluding those in whom leadership is traditionally concentrated.  Furthermore, distribution of \nleadership emphatically does not imply equal spread of leadership among all parties.  Power and \ninfluence may remain concentrated in certain \u2017nodes\u2018 of leadership, who \u2015lead up and out rather \nthan down\u2016 (Crosby and Bryson 2005, 32).  This is, indeed, the finding of Vangen and Huxham \n(2003), who find that the leadership qualities required by network managers are as much about \n\u2017thuggery\u2018\u2014manipulation and politicking\u2014as about facilitation and mobilization.  These \ncontours of distributed leadership\u2014in particular, its relation to traditional top-down authority, \nand its potential concentration in new nodes of power\u2014are important to acknowledge in an \nunderstanding of the role of leadership in networks.  As with transformational leadership, \ndistributed leadership is seen in the literature as having the potential to improve organizational \nperformance (Rainey and Steinbauer 1999; Denis et al. 1996; 2000; Pearce and Conger 2003). \nGovernment policy in England has emphasized the centrality of leadership in the \nmodernization of all fields of public services (Cabinet Office 1999).  Calls for individualistic \nleadership from the top and distribution of leadership co-exist in government policy, so that in \nhealth, for example, programs supporting transformational leadership from organizational heads \nare accompanied by efforts to empower staff and \u2015lead change through people\u2016.3 \n                                                 \n3 See, for example, http:\/\/www.nhsleadershipqualities.nhs.uk\/, accessed 18 September 2007 \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

To this \nextent, then, the logic of these approaches to public service reform is evident.  As we see in the \nnext section, however, the practice is not so clear cut. \nNetworks and leadership: obstacles and impediments \nIn implementing networks in the public services, certain practical difficulties come to light.  First, \nand most obviously, the resilience of the hierarchy and the increasing role of the market in many \nnational contexts mean that networks have coexisted alongside two other organizational forms, \nwith certain consequent tensions.  Top-down performance management and quasi-market-based \ncompetition have the potential to drive a wedge between individuals and organizations in a way \nthat is inimical to the collaborative ideals of the network (Ferlie and Pettigrew 1996; Currie and \nSuhomlinova 2006).  To the extent that their performance is managed according to their core \nduties, and judged in competition with their colleagues, professionals will tend to orient towards \ntheir own silos rather than reach out to foster collaborative relationships which may not benefit \nthem.  The same is true of organizations (Hood et al. 2000; McNulty and Ferlie 2002; Ferlie et al. \n2003) and is reflected in various national contexts where network-based reforms coexist with \nother organizational forms, such as Australia (Ryan and Walsh 2004), the Scandinavian countries \n(Christensen et al. 2007), the Netherlands (Kickert et al. 1997; Brandsen and van Hout 2006) and \nthe US (Provan et al. 2004).  Competition between organizations in contexts governed by market \nor quasi-market relations, as exhibited for example in managed care networks in the US, will have \na similarly divisive effect (Shortell et al. 2000), with the risk that agencies relapse into \nrelationships based on contracting rather than collaboration (Brandsen and van Hout 2006; Keast \nand Brown 2006). \nFurthermore, many public-service fields, such as health and education, are professional \nbureaucracies in which these kinds of difficulties are compounded (Riccucci 2005).  Each \nprofession has its own pervasive socialization, which might work against a network orientation in \na number of ways: a professional knowledge domain that is esoteric, to some extent tacit, and \ndifficult to share (Currie and Suhomlinova 2006); a career pathway that tends to be based on \nspecialization rather than broadening of knowledge (Nancarrow and Borthwick 2005); and a \nplace in a well established and institutionalized hierarchy of professions and subprofessions (Bate \n2000).  Consequently professions have long been acknowledged as averse to managerial \ninterventions (e.g. Lipsky 1980; Riccucci 2005). Notably for our empirical field, physicians are \noften characterized as the quintessential autonomous profession (e.g. Riccucci 2005), and tend to \nbe individualistic in their practice and attitude towards integration (Shortell et al. 2000).  \nFurthermore, the status, power, and expertise of the medical profession mean that any set of \norganizational reforms requires the compliance of physicians for its effectiveness (Greco and \nEisenberg 1993; Shortell et al. 1998).  This is arguably all the more so in the NHS, where in \ncontrast to the relative erosion of medical power and autonomy in the US (Hafferty and Light \n1995), physicians have retained an authority that gives them power of veto over NHS \nadministrators in regard of any organizational reconfigurations that they do not welcome \n(Harrison et al. 1992; Ferlie and Pettigrew 1996; Bate 2000). \nMoreover, there is the risk that, in insisting that organizations adopt a more networked \nform, policymakers undermine the very essence that makes the network a functional \norganizational form in the first place.  If they rely for their effectiveness and dynamism upon \ntheir voluntaristic, informal and organic nature, then efforts to impose networks may have \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

In particular, as Kickert and Koppenjan (1997: 39) point out, in \nnetworks, \u2015government is not the single dominant actor that can unilaterally impose its will.  \nHierarchicial, central top-down steering does not work in networks.\u2016  Rather, governance \nmechanisms must fit within the network structure (Bruijn and Heuvelhof 1997).  Yet the ongoing \ninfluence of top-down performance management regimes, so strong in countries such as the UK \nwhere vertical accountability remains characteristic of public services, may militate against this \nneed, to the extent that the network may become little more than an instrument of surveillance \nand performance management, to the detriment of collaborative efforts by network managers \nand members (Addicott et al. 2007). \nThe necessity of more lateral means of governing and guiding networks towards common \naims creates particular challenges for the leader within the public-service network.  The widely \nnoted ambiguity of objectives, power and accountability that characterizes the public sector as \ncompared to the private sector (Heifetz 1994; Denis et al. 1996; 2000) is compounded, as we \nhave seen, by the network.  This suggests a need for the distribution of leadership across \nindividuals in collaborating organizations.  However, organizational objectives are frequently set \nby stakeholders external to networks, such as policymakers.  This complicates any such effort to \npluralize change agency and distribute leadership, since actors across networks will be constrained \nin their actions by the parameters set by these external stakeholders (Currie and Lockett 2007), \nwhich may not encourage collaborative activity.  Furthermore, the hierarchical order of \nprofessions\u2014in health, for example, the ongoing subservience of nursing to medicine, at least in \nthe view of many physicians, and the endurance of intra-professional hierarchies and power \nrelationships (for example between surgery and medicine) (Currie and Suhomlinova 2006)\u2014is \nalso likely to, at best, complicate any effort to distribute leadership beyond traditional leaders. \nNetworks and leadership: transforming structure and agency? \nThe preceding section indicates the difficulties of establishing both networks and corresponding \nmodes of leadership in public services characterized by the co-existence of other organizational \nforms and various tensions between professions and policy aims.  Ostensibly, distributed \nleadership and networked organizational forms seem well suited to each other, but the \ncomplications of the public-services context mean that their effectiveness and synergy in \neffecting service reform are compromised.  Equally, however, each policy might have the \npotential to surmount the difficulties presented by the contingencies of the public services, by \nreconfiguring power relationships to foster a more dynamic organization than one governed by \nhierarchy or competition. \nWhat is suggested in particular is the need for an enactment of leadership that seeks to \nengage a multiplicity of stakeholders, facilitating and consolidating change by concentrating on \nprocesses and outcomes together (Huxham and Vangen 2000; Vangen and Huxham 2003).  Even \nas this suggests a distribution of leadership, it also implies personal investment by those charged \nwith network leadership tasks: as Huxham and Vangen (2000, 1171) have it, \u2015it is paradoxical that \nthe single-mindedness of leaders appears to be central to collaborative success.\u2016  At the same \ntime, though, in a professional bureaucracy characterized by looseness of accountability and \npractitioner autonomy, there is a need to engage professionals for organizational change to be \nachieved and consolidated (Shortell et al. 2000; Riccucci 2005).  Any change needs to ensure that \n\u2015organizational players are empowered enough to be able to avoid the frustration and chaos that \nleads to the reassertion of pervious forms and processes\u2016 (Ferlie et al. 1996, 14).  \nIn other words, the structural change of the network is reliant on the agency of leaders\u2014\ndistributed or otherwise\u2014in making it functional, since \u2015formal bureaucratic structure, as defined \nby rules and regulations, has little impact on the behaviors of front-line workers\u2016 (Riccucci 2005, \n64).  For all the collaborative rhetoric of the network form, then, it will have little tangible impact \non practice in the absence of effective leadership.  In making this rhetoric reality, leaders can, \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

Structures, for \nexample, \u2015normally emerge out of the practical reality of the tasks that they tackle\u2016 (Huxham and \nVangen 2000, 1167), so that even within an overarching organizational structure, certain \n\u2017substructures\u2018 might be assembled in pursuit of the leader\u2018s task.  Similarly, O\u2018Toole (1997, 48) \nsuggests to network managers the possibilities of a number of routes to influence: \u2015find ways to \nshift network membership toward more supportive coalitions; locate key allies at crucial nodes; \ntry to alter agreements between the parties to heighten program salience; and buffer well-\nfunctioning arrays to limit uncertainty and complexity.\u2016  Crosby and Bryson (2005) indicate the \npotential for influence in networks through \u2017forums\u2018, \u2017arenas\u2018 and \u2017courts\u2018, each subject to their \nown rules of conduct and therefore amenable to particular enactments of leadership.  These are \nthe concrete opportunities within inter-organizational collaborations for leaders to be effective, \nfor example through visionary leadership, \u2015creating and communicating shared meaning\u2016 in \nformal and informal network forums that inseminate ideas, and political leadership, \u2015making and \nimplementing decisions\u2016 in the legislative and executive arenas that determine formal policy \n(Crosby and Bryson 2005, 35). \nWhilst the nature of the structures, processes and participants of the network will vary, and \nwith them the opportunities for influence, what these ideas do encompass is an emergent image \nof what the effective leader within a network might look like, in terms of skills, style and \npersonality.  The remainder of this paper considers this question, as well as the more general \nquestion of the interaction between the structural reform of the network and the agency of \nleaders in achieving change.  In the next section, we introduce the specific field in which we \nconducted our fieldwork, and describe the service reform that the pilots studied attempted to \nintroduce into this context. \nCancer networks in the NHS, modernization and service reform \nAlthough in the UK networked public services are often characterized by commentators as being \na particular feature of policies of new Labour governments since 1997, the form has earlier roots.  \nReflecting wider trends for networked organization in the policies of various developed-world \ncountries, UK public services were already moving towards networked governance in the early \n1990s under the previous Conservative administration (Newman 2001).  To this extent, networks \ncan be seen as a logical development of the New Public Management policies prevalent across \ndeveloped-world governments, especially those subject to Anglo-American influences (Ferlie et \nal. 1996; Kickert et al. 1997; O\u2018Toole 1997).  In the UK, health policy was an early adopter of the \nnetwork principle, with \u2017managed clinical networks\u2018 introduced in a variety of specialties, \nincluding cancer, in the NHS from the mid-1990s, mirroring trends towards networked health-\nservice delivery in Europe (Wijngaarden et al. 2006) and the US (Shortell et al. 1994). \nThough funded from general taxation and offering universal access to British citizens, the \nNHS is far from a monolithic public-service organization.  In common with other fields of \npublic-service provision, the introduction of the internal market to the NHS in the early 1990s \ncreated an increasingly fragmented organizational scene.  From a system based on geographically \ndetermined organizational divisions, the NHS was subdivided into purchaser and provider \n\u2017trusts\u2018, each effectively an organization in its own right, with autonomy over its human resources \npolicies, contracting arrangements, and finances, and the potential (in theory) for bankruptcy \n(though the political unacceptability of hospital closures ensured that in practice this was rarely \nthreatened, with mergers and takeovers a more palatable alternative).  As with public-service \nnetworks elsewhere in Europe and the world (Kickert et al. 1997), then, the network represented \none means of mediating such organizational fragmentation: effectively, managed clinical networks \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n8 \nin the NHS were to be inter-organizational in character (between autonomous NHS trusts), albeit \ntechnically within a single overarching organization, the NHS. \nIn relation to cancer, the 1995 Calman-Hine report envisaged new service structures in \nEngland and Wales \u2015based on a network of expertise in cancer care reaching from primary care \nthrough Cancer Units in district hospitals [acute secondary-care hospitals] to Cancer Centres \n[specialist tertiary-care facilities]\u2016 (Department of Health 1995, 7).  The vision here was of a \nnetwork that would coexist with the emerging internal market in healthcare, by encouraging \ncompeting providers to work together with purchasers to reduce duplication of services and \npromote clearer patient pathways.  Good practice was to spread across the network through \nleadership from the medical lead in collaboration with colleagues across the network.  In the \ninterests of better clinical outcomes, though, concentration of expertise was also on the agenda, \nwith cancer units needing a critical mass of patient throughput to maintain surgical sub-\nspecialization, and expertise in rarer cancers and specialist diagnostic and treatment processes to \nbe concentrated in cancer centers.  Consequently, while they were intended to be collaborative \nventures between the different partners in the networks, \u2017big players\u2018 in the networks\u2014hospitals \nwith much to gain or lose from the concentration of resources\u2014have in many places come to \ndominate their agenda over smaller hospitals and primary care organizations.  From the start, \ncancer networks were intended to promote both service rationalization and collaboration\u2014with all \nthe potential tensions this could create.  However, as Addicott et al. (2007, 95) point out, in \nrecent years the role of cancer networks has been significantly managerialized, becoming \u2015largely \nfocused on the structural configuration of services, performance targets and workforce \nplanning.\u2016  In four of the five cancer networks they study, a preoccupation with meeting top-\ndown performance-management agenda meant that collaboration was limited. \nDespite their government-driven mandate, cancer networks mirrored the function of two \nrather different network forms in the US.  First, they reflected the role of integrated networks of \nhealth-care providers that emerged in response to the market pressures created by the advent of \nmanaged care, as a means of rationalizing services and offering cost-effectiveness through \neconomies of scale (Shortell et al. 1994).  Second\u2014and as Addicott et al. (2007) point out, in \ntension with the first role\u2014they also serve a function similar to that of the community clinical \noncology programs and special populations networks funded by the National Cancer Institute, \nwith their aim of fostering knowledge-sharing relationships between research institutions and \ncommunity-based intervention, education and research projects (McKinney et al. 1993; Baquet et \nal. 2005). \nThis was the context faced by the pilot program of cancer-genetics services cosponsored \nby the Department of Health and Macmillan Cancer Support,4 which sought to improve \nprovision in this field by introducing a structured care pathway for those with a suspected family \nhistory of cancer.  The Harper report (Department of Health 1998) identified inequalities, \ninefficiencies and poor practice in cancer-genetics provision, and suggested a division of labor \nand flow of knowledge between primary care, cancer units and cancer centers which mirrored the \nset-up of cancer networks.  This would result in smoother patient experiences, and the \nelimination of poor practice, such as inaccurate risk assessments resulting in unnecessary \nscreening (if genetic risk is overestimated) or inappropriate reassurance (if underestimated). An \nexpert group convened by Macmillan and the Department of Health operationalized this in a \nframework known as the \u2017Kenilworth model\u2018, and in turn, this was adapted to local conditions \nand piloted in seven locations across England.  With endorsement from an expert committee \ncomprising policymakers, hospital clinicians, family physicians (GPs), nurses, service users and \n                                                 \n4 Macmillan is a British cancer charity with a particular interest in contributing to improving the \nmanagement of cancer, and ensuring an improved patient experience by working towards more \njoined-up cancer provision within the NHS, and between NHS and other providers of care. \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n9 \nothers, it had credibility and a degree of \u2017top-down push\u2018, though it was not mandated; rather, the \nexpectation was that each pilot would shape the care pathway in accordance with the \nparticularities of its own locality.  \nIn principle, then, the Kenilworth model represented just the kind of improvement to and \nrationalization of service organization that cancer networks were designed to help to achieve and \nreproduce.  In terms of innovation diffusion, the overall setting augured well.  With the change \nagency of Macmillan and the Department of Health behind it, the innovation of the Kenilworth \nmodel seemed to have some leverage behind it, and addressed an identifiable problem (Rogers \n2003).  Given the preceding discussion, however, there are clear obstacles to the operation of \nnetworked collaboration, and to leadership, that might confound uptake and establishment of the \nnew care pathway.  In the remainder of this paper, we compare the trajectories of two of the \nKenilworth pilots, considering the roles played by leadership and by the cancer networks in \nwhich they were located in their course.  The degree of success of the two pilots was divergent, as \nassessed in terms of two key outcomes: throughput of patients, and whether the model was \nsustained beyond the pilot period.  \u2017Derton\u2018 had a throughput that was several times that of \n\u2017Nottley\u2018; the project (and therefore the Kenilworth-based care pathway) in Derton was sustained \nwith local money following the pilot period, while Nottley\u2018s project and pathway were not.5 \nMethods \nThese two cases were among 11 that were selected as case studies for a wider evaluation of a \nprogram of pilot genetics services in the NHS.  This program encompassed 28 government-\nfunded pilots working in various clinical areas, including the seven cancer-genetics pilots working \nto implement the Kenilworth model in different localities.  The pilots followed a genetics white \npaper (Secretary of State for Health 2003), which set out the aim of \u2017mainstreaming\u2018 genetics \nknowledge and practice in everyday NHS provision.  The pilots were to be one means of \nachieving this ambition. \nThe brief of the evaluation was to identify the barriers and facilitators faced by the pilots in \nrealizing this aim.  In pursuit of this, a comparative-case-study approach was adopted, using \nqualitative methods to facilitate intra- and inter-case analysis to illuminate key differences of \ncontext and mechanism that give rise to differences of outcome.  This enables generalization \nthrough process analysis and the development of theory (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2003).  More \ngenerally, where quantitative approaches permit the statistically based identification of apparent \ncorrelations between cause and effect, qualitative methods such as these are particularly useful in \nelucidating the mechanisms which give rise to such correlations (Lee 1999; Silverman 2004).  As \nsuch, they are well suited to the study of processes within organizations (Pettigrew 1997; Langley \n1999): in this case, the establishment of service reform within a network and the enactment of \nleadership in facilitating this.  Our study thus addresses the gap identified by Bryman (2004) in \nrelation to research on leadership, by adopting a qualitative approach which does not simply \nattempt to replicate quantitative research in identifying the key variables on which effectiveness \nrests, but rather focuses on the mechanisms in given contexts (such as the network) that give rise \nto certain outcomes. \nOur selection of 11 case studies from 28 funded pilots was theoretically guided (Eisenhardt \n1989).  The intention was to select a sample that was representative of the variation present \namong the 28 pilots in terms of a number of variables.  These included clinical field, host \norganization (primary care organization (PCT), \u2017mainstream\u2018 clinical department in a hospital, \nspecialist genetics centre), profession of pilot lead (medical geneticist, mainstream physician, GP, \n                                                 \n5 We use pseudonyms and do not give exact figures regarding patient throughput here, in order to \nprotect the identities of our case-study sites, in accordance with the terms of ethical approval for \nthe wider evaluation from which this paper derives. \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

Potential cases were assessed by members of the research team on the basis \nof documentary materials provided by the pilots, and preliminary interviews with pilot leads in \nevery site.  Following this, the research team selected its sample of 11, which included four (of a \ntotal of seven) cancer-genetics pilots aiming to implement the Kenilworth model.  The focus of \nthis paper is on the pilots in Derton and Nottley, which were both based in hospitals and served \nareas covered by their cancer networks.  The other two cancer-genetics cases were considerably \nsmaller in scale, each serving the population of the single PCTs which hosted them, and therefore \nengaging less with the wider cancer networks.  Whilst the issues relating to cancer networks in \nthis paper are specific to Derton and Nottley\u2014since no other pilot among the 11 cases was \nembedded within a network in this way\u2014other findings presented (for example, the range of \nleadership behaviors exhibited) have much in common with the wider findings in the other case-\nstudy sites. \nIn each case-study site, our research included a number of qualitative methods: in-depth \ninterviews with pilot stakeholders, participant and non-participant observation of meetings at \npilot and program level, and documentary analysis.  The interviews covered a number of issues, \ngrouped under the following headings: collaborative working, information technology, human \nresources management, leadership, user involvement, knowledge management, organizational \nculture, policy.  Whilst the interview schedule included a number of possible questions under \neach heading, in line with in-depth interview methodology, the interviewers tended to use these \nas prompts only, deviating from the list of questions to discuss issues as they were relevant to \nrespondents and their organizational contexts, but seeking to frame questions as openly as \npossible so as not to \u2017lead\u2018 interviewees (Silverman 2004).  In the course of observational \nresearch, we paid particular attention to exchanges of knowledge between involved parties, and \nbarriers identified in the course of meetings to collaboration and service reform in their \n\u2017mainstreaming genetics\u2018 ambitions.  Documentary analysis encompassed bid documents, reports \nto sponsors and evaluation reports, and focused on the same issues as those explored through \ninterviews and observation, with particular attention paid to change through time. \nSome 88 interviews have been conducted across the 11 sites, including 12 each in Derton \nand Nottley.  Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed in their entirety, and lasted between \n40 minutes and three hours.  In Derton and Nottley, similar respondents were interviewed, \nreflecting the similar aims and organizational contexts of the two pilots.  They included pilot \nleads (medical geneticists in both cases), nurses and genetic counselors involved in delivering the \npilots, primary-care based practitioners such as GPs, managers and clinicians within the cancer \nnetworks and the host hospitals, and service users involved as members of the projects\u2018 steering \ngroups.   Data drawn from observation and documentary-analysis activities both informed these \ninterviews and complemented them, by illuminating the approaches taken to establishing service \nreform within wider networks, and the barriers encountered in attempting this. \nWe undertook an iterative analysis process, rereading and coding transcripts, notes and \ndocuments, generating themes, and cross-checking these through discussions between authors.  \nThematically related parts of the embedded analysis in each data source were grouped together.  \nEach of the three authors had engaged in fieldwork, and all three engaged in analysis.  In Derton, \nGPM developed an initial analysis which was checked by GC; in Nottley, RF developed an initial \nanalysis which was checked by GPM.  We discussed the coding of transcripts, document and \nmeeting notes with each other, ensuring inter-researcher reliability of interpretation and \nenhancing analysis.  Subsequently, the analysis agreed across the authorial team for each case was \nconsidered against the over-arching research questions.  As a means of triangulating this analysis, \nfindings were presented to both the commissioners of and participants in the research, providing \na check on the authenticity of our analysis (Yin 2003). \nIn presenting qualitative analysis, a number of approaches are possible, each seeking in its \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

Our approach in this \npaper involves presenting the narratives from the two cases examined in turn: in-depth \ndescriptions that deploy the primary data to illustrate the dimensions of leadership in the \nestablishment of service reform they emerged in the cancer networks of Derton and Nottley, \nwhich reflect many of the key findings from the other nine case-study sites.    \nResults: Derton \nThis pilot was led by a specialist geneticist, but he was keen to ensure that the service was \ndelivered through and \u2017owned\u2018 by the cancer network, which covered three acute hospitals \n(comprising two cancer units and one cancer centre) and 10 PCTs.  Genetics provision here had \npreviously been delivered from another hospital, some 40 miles from the cancer center: \nconsequently patients and clinicians in the network had seen genetics as a remote specialty, its \nperceived esoteric knowledge compounded by its geographical distance.  Recently, however, a \nnew genetics \u2017satellite unit\u2018 had been set up in the hospital that hosted the cancer centre, and the \ngeneticist leading the project had been appointed to a post here with a view to improving genetics \ncoverage in this underserved area.  The prior inaccessibility of cancer-genetics expertise had led \nto the setting up of a plethora of local protocols within the network for dealing with suspected \ninherited cases of cancer. \nThis variation, together with the arrival of the genetics satellite unit two years earlier, had \ncreated the political will within the cancer network for a more coherent way of dealing with \nsuspected family histories of cancer, and an opportunity to do something about it.  A colorectal \nsurgeon (and, notably, the current medical director of the cancer network) described the \ndissatisfaction with the incumbent system: \n\u2015The ones with the really high risk we would have sent to [the genetics service], obviously.  \nBut there\u2018s a lot of them who didn\u2018t fit the high-risk criteria, for example for bowel cancer, \nand we give them advice which\u2014you\u2018re not quite, 100 percent sure whether it is \nscientifically based.\u2016 \nColorectal surgeon \nClinicians in cancer-related specialties outside genetics had taken on responsibility for genetic risk \nassessment.  But they encountered criteria for assessing genetic risk in breast, bowel and ovarian \ncancer which were far from universally agreed upon, and limited access to specialist clinical \nknowledge which might assist adjudication.  Here, then, was a potentially receptive structure in \nterms of the attitudes of the network\u2018s members, with political will exemplified by the attitude of \nthe colorectal surgeon and medical director of the network quoted above. \nHaving taken up responsibility for genetic risk assessment reluctantly, existing services had \nnevertheless grown into an important part of cancer-service provision locally.  Growing patient \nnumbers and dissatisfaction over the variation in protocols saw the issue rise in importance \nwithin the cancer network, for practitioners and managers alike.  Increasing numbers of patients \nwere being admitted to screening services, without a \u2017proper\u2018 (i.e. universally agreed) system of \nweighing the benefits and risks that might accrue from this radiation exposure.  Moreover, this \nwas without the explicit agreement of the primary-care purchasers who paid for the service, and \nthis was a concern for the hospitals providing the service, who feared that in the absence of an \nagreed contract, funding might be withdrawn.  As with the attitudes of clinicians, the \norganizational context too, then, was potentially receptive to the kind of change in care pathways \naugured by the Kenilworth model. \nConsequently\u2014and in contrast to the experience of Nottley below, and indeed of other \ncase-study sites not detailed here\u2014the cancer network was proactive in seeking to establish the \npilot as an integral part of local cancer care pathways, as a means of solving these issues.  The \npilot\u2018s lead clinician, meanwhile, was acutely aware of the need to ensure ownership by the \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

He sought \nto ensure \u2017ownership\u2018 of the service by the network, and adopted a highly dialogical and \ndiplomatic stance in putting his ideas to colleagues within the network: \nLead: [Previously] there was no continuity, and no discussion between genetics and the \nsurgeons. I think if any lesson\u2018s come out of this project, it\u2018s that this sort of very \ndetailed day-to-day discussion underpins a successful service.  If you don\u2018t have that \nnetworking, then you can\u2018t sustain a service. \nGPM: The discussion between geneticists and their referrers? \nLead: Yes, the stakeholders, the ability to sit down with somebody and explain exactly what \nyou want to do, and for them to be able to pick up the phone and say, \u2017I\u2018ve got this \npatient: what do you think?\u2018, any different niggles that happen.  If you\u2018ve got \nsomeone who\u2018s not happy, it\u2018s easy to go and see them or pick up the phone: it\u2018s just \nsimple human communication. \nLead (clinical geneticist) \nThrough these kinds of forums, in Crosby and Bryson\u2018s (2005) lexicon, the clinical lead provided a \nvision in a politically sensitive way.  These dialogical, quiet leadership skills had some success in \npaving the way for the service reform, as confirmed by the geneticist\u2018s new colleagues: \n\u2015It sounds a bit like I\u2018m blowing [his] trumpet, but seriously, he was a knight in shining \narmor, and was really swamped with demands from people like me, who wanted to have \nthis pathway set up, like, yesterday.  It was very efficient very quickly.  And [he] is a \nparticularly good public-relations individual: his ability to make complicated genetics \nunderstandable is almost unique.\u2016 \nGynecological oncologist \nIn persuading physicians in these forums, then, a \u2017quiet\u2018 approach to leadership was important, \nalongside firm, quantitative evidence of the potential benefits of the service reform in terms of \npatient outcomes and conforming to national guidance on risk assessment: \u2015speaking their \nlanguage,\u2016 as the pilot lead put it.  In Crosby and Bryson\u2018s (2005) terminology, this was about \nvisionary leadership using forums adroitly in order to create a compelling, shared vision of service \nreform, and utilizing existing \u2015norms of relevance and pragmatic communication, media and \nmodes of argument\u2016 (Crosby and Bryson 2005, 120) to good effect. \nCredibility with physicians, through quiet leadership and the language of clinical audit, was \nhowever only one aspect of consolidating the place of the service within the network.  Equally \nimportant was winning over the nurses who had taken on responsibility for risk assessment under \nthe extant system, on whom the pilot relied for much of its throughput.  This rather different \nprofessional group necessitated a different approach, requiring that the entire pilot team be \nversed in the arts of quiet leadership and negotiation.  So one of the pilot\u2018s nurses took on the \ntask of delicately persuading other nurses about the improvements that the new system might \nbring, deploying her understanding of \u2015nursing culture,\u2016 as she put it. \nThus the pilot team members adapted their leadership to the different constituencies to be \npersuaded.  \u2017Objective evidence\u2018 was a key means of convincing medical specialists.  Nurses, as \nthe delivers of the service, were generally more concerned about the effects of the new model on \nthe patient experience.  Persuading each group, though, was crucial to the pilot\u2018s success, and \neach group could be engaged through its own informal and formal forums, with their own \nunwritten rules of engagement.  And once key physicians and nurses elsewhere in the network \nhad been convinced of the worth of the new system, they themselves were likely to spread \nacceptance among their colleagues.  A breast-care nurse specialist in one of the cancer units, who \nhad previously taken on much of the local risk-assessment work, explained how her colleagues \nhad had concerns that the new care pathway was \u2015just a way of getting people out of the system.\u2016  \nFollowing her own discussions with the lead nurse on the pilot, she was now convinced of its \nworth, and had been instrumental in persuading other nurses in the unit, acting as a \u2015link\u2016 \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

In this way, the initial visionary work of the pilot team \nmembers as leaders gave rise to a more diffuse leadership, in Huxham and Vangen\u2018s (2000) terms \nenacted through the structures and processes of the network as well as embodied in the wider \nparticipants beyond the core leaders from the pilot team. \nThe success of this process also rested on the effective structure of the cancer network, \nrecognized by respondents as being functional, democratic and consensual, at least compared \nwith others.6  Prior to the start of the pilot, the network had convened a \u2017visioning event\u2018, \nattended by stakeholders (physicians, nurses, managers, patients, others) from every hospital and \nPCT in the network, and this was seen to have promoted the sense of \u2017network ownership\u2018 so \ndesired by the pilot lead.  This, then, had provided an important forum for the development of a \ncollective vision.  More generally, the pilot lead highlighted the role of the network in establishing \nthe service across the cancer units, citing the leadership of one network manager in particular: \n\u2015When I met her, I thought, \u2017Goodness, this woman is so networked!\u2018  She\u2018s been a senior \nnurse for years and she knows everyone.  She knows the system: she\u2018s got an amazing \nknowledge of how to exert mild pressures here and there to achieve different aims.\u2016 \nLead (clinical geneticist) \nAlongside the receptive structural context provided by the network and its forums, and the \ndelicate, visionary leadership work of the pilot team, the pilot\u2018s establishment also rested on the \nslightly more directive leadership enacted by this manager.  Occasionally, individual clinicians \nwere reluctant to accept the implications of the pilot for their own practice, despite the efforts of \npilot staff through quiet leadership and audit evidence.  On such occasions, the consensus of the \nwider network, once achieved, could be deployed as a means of persuasion in its own right, as the \nmanager explained: \n\u2015The objectivity of the network is useful to say, \u2017You\u2018re not supposed to be doing that kind \nof work on patients\u2018: we bring intelligence from elsewhere in the network. [\u2026] Often just \nby bringing that objectivity, it can be made to work, by bringing in other clinical views.\u2016 \nCancer-network manager \nIn these ways, the collaborative rhetoric of the notional \u2017network\u2018 was made real.  Where \ncollegiate, professional leadership through the network\u2018s structures and processes did not \nsucceed, a certain amount of more directive, manipulative, even \u2017thuggish\u2018 (Vangen and Huxham \n2003) leadership could fill in, using this \u2015objectivity\u2016 of the network as a tool of persuasion of \nmore reluctant actors. \nThe network itself, then, and the shrewd and varied leadership tactics of various agents \nwithin it, was effective at gaining sign-up willingly or reluctantly from a range of hospital \npractitioners.  Engaging with primary-care practitioners, though, was less straightforward.  \nCrucially, primary-care stakeholders were not such central actors in the network, with its \nmandated focus on service rationalization.  The pilot had held various educational and publicity \nevents for GPs and community nurses, but ensuring longer-term engagement was a challenge.  \nNotably, there were fewer forums at which primary-care actors might be engaged; furthermore, \nthere were fewer obvious common interests between the pilots and GPs, on which visionary \nleadership might draw.  To this extent, primary-care practitioners were on the fringes of the \nnetwork, both in terms of its \u2017infrastructure\u2018 and in terms of the commonalities of interest on \nwhich it was built. \nSimilar difficulties were present in the pilot\u2018s efforts to obtain ongoing funding, which \ninvolved dealing with purchasers who were also based in primary care.  Though it had sign-up \u2017in \nprinciple\u2018 from purchasers from the start, making post-pilot financial arrangements was not \nstraightforward.  Notably, although formally included in the network, those in charge of \n                                                 \n6 As one cancer network manager here confided: \u2015I\u2018ve been to other networks where they haven\u2018t \ngot relationships with hospitals: they\u2018re not allowed in through the doors.\u2016 \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n14 \npurchasing decisions in primary care were also responsible for funding a range of services beyond \ncancer.  Consequently, negotiations about ongoing funding were subject to a range of \nconsiderations emanating from outside the cancer network.  In Crosby and Bryson\u2018s (2005) \nterms, this arena was one which was subject to a range of different authorities and influences, \nincluding not only competing services but also centrally determined guidance on funding \npriorities.  Furthermore, reorganization and management changes within primary care meant that \nnot all purchasers were willing to follow through on their original commitment to the pilot; and \nindeed only about half the PCTs in the network eventually funded the service and care pathway \non an ongoing basis.  This partial success highlights the fact that the structure of the network, \nand the styles of leadership this facilitates, is limited where it meets other principles of \norganization and governance, a theme which we will take up in the discussion.  And as we \ndiscover in the next section, this space of operation can be even more constricted by the \noverlapping imperatives of other organizational forms. \nResults: Nottley \nThis was a joint pilot led by two geneticists at neighboring hospitals, part of a large cancer \nnetwork containing six hospital trusts and covering a total population of around two million \n(twice that of the network in Derton).  The pilot involved two, largely separate, projects aimed at \nincreasing the accessibility of cancer genetics in primary care.  Here we focus on one of these\u2014\nwhich used advertising in GPs\u2018 surgeries to attract self-referrals from concerned individuals, \nespecially those from \u2017hard-to-reach\u2018 ethnic-minority backgrounds\u2014though many of the issues \nwe raise apply to both.  In common with Derton, both projects followed the core principles of \nthe Kenilworth model to rationalize care pathways.  Given the primary-care focus, however, the \nprincipal constituencies to whom they needed to appeal were quite different.  The catchment of \neach project was also smaller than in Derton, partly because of concerns about the risk of \noverwhelming the genetics service with new referrals by \u2017opening the door\u2018 in primary care. \nAs in Derton, the pilot had obtained sign-up from the cancer network, but here the \nnetwork was somewhat less proactive in encouraging and spreading the work of the two projects.  \nThere was a sense that the cancer network was preoccupied with conforming to central-\ngovernment targets, and with the need to find funding for existing services from cash-strapped \npurchasers: \n\u2015Because it hasn\u2018t got a definitive work stream or target attached to it, no-one has said to \nme in the three-and-a-half years I\u2018ve been here, \u2017Account for what you\u2018re doing on cancer \ngenetics\u2018\u2014and they ask me that about lots of other things.  I\u2018ve got to have action plans on \na million things, but cancer genetics isn\u2018t one of them. [\u2026] If I go to the [purchasers] with \nany service development, unless it is linked to a target or is completely unavoidable, they \njust say, \u2017You must be mad.\u2018  What they say\u2014which is true\u2014is: \u2017We haven\u2018t got the money \nto run the services we\u2018ve got: why would we fund new services?\u2018\u2016 \nCancer network manager \nCompared to Derton, the network seemed much more governed by hierarchical principles\u2014\nespecially conformity to centrally determined priorities\u2014and this was reflected in the nature of \nthe leadership enacted by this network manager and others. \nThe pilot thus sought to forge its own relationships with primary-care practitioners and the \ntarget communities, but with mixed success.  The project successfully negotiated space in the \npremises of a number of GP practices to carry out its surgeries and to display advertising \nmaterials.  But contact with GPs went little further than this, due to difficulties similar to those \nexperienced by the pilot staff in Derton, around the lack of buy-in from primary-care \nprofessionals.  So pilot staff decided to concentrate on self-referrals, exempting GPs from the \ncare pathway and avoiding the need to bring them onboard.  However, engaging the target \ncommunities in the pilot also proved problematic, and so efforts to increase uptake from \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n15 \nminority-ethnic groups had only marginal success: \nAdministrator: It\u2018s always been the aim but it hasn\u2018t necessarily come to the outcome we \nwould like. \nRF: In terms of? \nAdministrator: Because gaining access to some ethnic minorities is very difficult.  I still \nthink there\u2018s a lot of understanding yet to be achieved as to why we don\u2018t get these \npeople coming forward. \nWith little experience of such community-engagement strategies, inseminating interest among the \npublic was problematic. \nEfforts, then, to engage the key stakeholders\u2014potential patients and GPs\u2014were marginal, \nby accident and design respectively.  This was in contrast to Derton, where the cancer network \nenabled the pilot to gain buy-in from clinicians within hospitals whose direct importance to the \nservice (as referrers) matched their indirect influence (in creating a critical mass of consensus and \nsupport among the powerful constituents of the network).7  An absence of common interest was \nexacerbated by the absence of the opportunities for effective leadership that the structures and \nprocesses of the network might provide.   Over time in Nottley, the realization dawned that given \na relatively low throughput of self-referrals, buy-in from primary-care practitioners (especially \nGPs, with their influence on purchasing decisions) was something that the project needed after \nall: \nGPM: Is it an issue if GPs don\u2018t know about it?  Do they need to know? \nGenetic counselor: Yeah, they do.  For any possibility of extending the service, they do.  \nEvery person we\u2018ve seen has had a letter, [\u2026] copied to their GP, so the GP knows \nthey\u2018ve been seen as part of the project.  But it\u2018s just along with the other thousand \n[things] they look at per day!  That\u2018s the side that has been a little disappointing, I \nthought we might get more involvement and a bit of ownership of the project \namongst the practice nurses, and the other staff in the GP surgeries.\u2016 \nPilot genetic counselor \nThe pilot staff had little experience of engagement with primary care, with its rather different set \nof pressures, policies and relationships.  The same culture shock had affected Derton to some \nextent, but there the project could rely on the proactive work of the cancer network or amenable \ngroups of hospital-based stakeholders.  Within Nottley, the structure of the network did not \nsupport the pilot team\u2018s forlorn efforts at influencing practitioners.  The managerial priorities of \nthe network were compounded by the fact that primary-care practitioners, though formally part \nof the network, were also subject to many other pressures and priorities. \nFurthermore, the pilot staff lacked experience of the competitive funding mechanisms for \nthis kind of project, being based in a specialist genetics department which received its funding \nthrough separate arrangements.  Bidding for money from mainstream purchasers was thus a \nforeign experience for the project lead, and the departmental business manager.  So, as a cancer-\nnetwork manager explained, the pilot was \u2015outside the mainstream cancer community\u2016 of the \nwider hospital, and therefore marginal to cancer clinicians, the cancer network, and purchasers.  \nThe manager continued that although she wanted the project to work, \u2015in terms of my overall \njob [in the cancer network]\u2014the things I am meant to lose sleep about\u2014it is quite a small part.\u2016  \nThe pilot, then, found itself falling between stools.  To use Crosby and Bryson\u2018s lexicon, it was \nestranged from the core concerns of the cancer network, and the opportunities for effecting \nvisionary leadership through the network\u2018s forums.  Like Derton, it was also estranged from the \nprimary-care-based purchasers.  Unlike Derton, though, it lacked the critical mass of support \n                                                 \n7 It was also in contrast to another case-study site not detailed here, where mobilization of \ninvolved service users had seen a proactive publicity campaign resulting in large numbers of self-\nreferrals and sustained media coverage for the service. \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

The absence of money or political will across the cancer network led \nthe project lead to surmise, rather gloomily, that proactive efforts to lead this kind of reform were \ndoomed to failure.  It would only be when genetics centers began to place directive limits on the \nnumbers of referrals that purchasers would be forced, reactively, to engage with the need for \nreformed care pathways and effective demand management. \nDiscussion \nThe divergent trajectories of these ostensibly similar service reforms, based on a common care-\npathway model, can be traced to a number of interacting factors.  Both sought to introduce \nservice-delivery reforms to improve client focus, and differences in the adaptation of this \nambition to existing provision were significant in this divergence in themselves.  However, the \ndivergent trajectories also related to differences in the contexts of the two pilots\u2014particularly the \nnetworks\u2014and the agency of those seeking to implement them\u2014notably, the presence or \nabsence of particular forms of leadership among pilot staff and wider stakeholders. \nIn both cases, the pilot staff attempted to draw on the resources of networks that should, \nin principle, be supportive of organizational reforms to rationalize care pathways, improve patient \noutcomes and reduce inconsistency of provision.  In practice, though, and reflecting the findings \nof Addicott et al. (2007), the network in Nottley was dysfunctional in this regard, with a focus on \nperformance management and efficiencies that squeezed out any non-mandated initiatives.  In \nDerton, the cancer network was more supportive of the pilot.  In part, this seemed due to the \nmore productive relationships already present, but it was notable also that the issue addressed by \nthe pilot was already high on the political agenda\u2014not least, due to financial concerns.  This \nconfirms the important point made by Van de Ven and Rogers (1988), that we should not \noveremphasize the role of organizational resistance in impeding innovation diffusion.   Rather, it \nmay be more instructive to view organizational resistance as the aggregate resistance of members, \nor the inappropriateness of the innovation to the core concerns of the organization, as seemed to \nbe the case in Nottley (Van de Ven and Rogers 1988).  In Derton, in contrast, the pilot was \naligned with the managerial agenda of the wider network, indicating that the susceptibility of \nnetworks to top-down pressures (Keast and Brown 2006; Addicott et al. 2007) is not necessarily \nan obstacle to collaboration within them (cf. Provan and Milward 1995; Moynihan and Ingraham \n2003; Olsen 2006)\u2014provided those concerned know which \u2015mild pressures\u2016 to exert, as the lead \nhere put it.  Rather, there was complementarity between the collegiate, \u2017quiet\u2018 leadership \nembodied by the pilot team and the slightly more directive leadership deployed by the network \nmanager, who recognized the synergy between the aims of the network and those of the pilot.  \nHere we echo the findings of various authors about the diversity of skills needed by leaders in \nnetworked settings (Riccucci 1995; Huxham and Vangen 2000; Vangen and Huxham 2003), the \nimportance of influential champions to innovation diffusion (Rogers 2003), and indeed the need \nfor leaders with different skills and organizational positions in relation to different leadership \ntasks (Shortell et al. 2000; Crosby and Bryson 2005).  Furthermore, we highlight that public-\nservice networks in particular, with diffuse objectives and loci of power, may require this \ncombination of leadership styles, and all the more so if they are professional bureaucracies with \nthe extant complexities of power and accountability that these entail.  Especially important in this \ncontext was the ability of the pilot team to make their service relevant to the concerns of others, \nincreasing the likelihood of acceptance (Harrison 1998; Ferlie et al. 2005; Fitzgerald and Dopson \n2005) by creating, as Crosby and Bryson (2005, 115) have it, \u2015communal stories that help diverse \nstakeholder groups develop a sense of what they have in common with each other and what they \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n17 \nmight do to tackle common problems and create a better future.\u2016  This was a crucial way in \nwhich heterophilous links, in Rogers\u2018 (2003) terms, were created to ensure that the Kenilworth \nmodel was adopted and accepted by diverse stakeholders.  \nEvident in Derton was the way in which the structure of the network facilitated effective \nleadership through formal and informal forums which provided pilot members with the \nopportunity to foster a collective vision with other actors, mirroring closely the role for visionary \nleadership articulated by Crosby and Bryson (2005).  Through the work of the pilot team in \nengaging with others through these forums, and the directive leadership of the network manager, \nthey were able to make effective use of the three \u2017leadership media\u2018 identified by Huxham and \nVangen (2000): the structure of the network provided a normative tool that could be used to \nbring \u2017deviant\u2018 practitioners into line; the processes of the network offered the opportunity for \nthe development of a shared vision; and, crucially, through other participants in the network, the \nvision was spread further and became established across diverse stakeholders.  Central to this, \nthen, was not just the quiet, distributed leadership within the pilot, but also the quiet, dispersed \nleadership (Buchanan et al. 2007b; cf. Hartley 2005) of stakeholders in the wider network.  The \nformer was to some extent under the control of the project, whereas the latter was more diffuse, \nbut nevertheless important to widespread uptake.  To this extent, then, the agency of the leaders \nrelied on the structures (and processes and participants) of the network.  This finding also reflects \nthe intimations of Alexander et al. (2001) on the importance of what they call \u2017collateral \nleadership\u2018 among both staff and community groups in the community-care networks they study, \nas a complement to\u2014not a substitute for\u2014more vision-based leadership.  Our findings here \nconverge with and develop existing literature in Europe and North America on distributed \nleadership in health-care settings (Denis et al, 2000; Huxham and Vangen 2000; Buchanan et al. \n2007a), local government (Hartley and Allison 2000) and education (Leithwood et al. 1999; \nSpillane et al. 2001; Gronn 2002).  These studies illustrate the importance of subtle, distributed \nforms of leadership in settings characterized by the ambiguity of objectives and power \nrelationships that typifies public-service organizations, particularly professional bureaucracies.  \nOur study shows how, with the added complication of the inter-organizational network, multiple \nforms of distributed and dispersed leadership are required to engage and inculcate diverse, \npowerful stakeholders, given the powerlessness to achieve change of any single actor or group of \nactors.  This combination of leadership styles\u2014and, perhaps more importantly, leaders\u2014seems \nfrom our study crucial to achieve transformative change in such a context. \nThus the structures, processes and participants of the network were essential resources for \nthe effectiveness of leadership.  It is in this sense, perhaps, that, as O\u2018Toole (1997, 49) has it, \nthere is a need for \u2015a consideration of networks as causal forces in the administrative setting.\u2016  \nCertainly, the efficacy of leadership in Derton relied in part on the opportunities and normative \nframework provided by the network.  However, what is also clear, from the comparison with \nNottley in particular, is the impotence of the network form in itself.  Without the will and the \nagency of its actors, as expressed through leadership at various organizational levels, the network \nhas no causal force.  Formal structures, as scholars such as Lipsky (1980), Sandfort (2000) and \nRiccucci (2005) have found, have little determining effect on the behavior of front-line staff, \nespecially where those staff enjoy professional autonomy.  As Sandfort (2000) suggests, it is the \ninformal structures of professionals\u2018 collective schemas of understanding that are determinant of \nbehavior, not the reconfiguration of formal, organizational structures.  As such, transformative \nagency is crucial, embodied in leadership of some form, even as leaders employ the structures, \nprocesses and participants of the network in achieving their ends.  To this extent, the \npolicymakers seem correct in their assessment of the need for complementarity. \nHowever, what our findings also illustrate are the limits to the space in which this \nsynergistic relationship between structure and agency can operate.  In Nottley especially, but to \nsome extent also in Derton, the influence of coexisting structural forms was always present.  This \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.

The division between \nprimary-care and hospital physicians has been noted as a significant barrier to integration \nelsewhere (Grumbach et al. 1999; Shortell et al. 2000).  The purchaser-provider split is a \nubiquitous one in networks in any field which is at least partly characterized by a contractual, \nmarket or quasi-market relationship (Kickert et al. 1997).  Though formally part of the network, it \nwas clear in both sites that physicians and purchasers were susceptible to neither the principles of \ncollaboration nor the performance of leadership in the way that the network\u2018s more central \nstakeholders were.  It is evident, then, that the space created for effective leadership by the \nstructural intervention of the network is a partial, constricted one, that is less open in the margins \nof the network where there are competing pressures on behavior from other organizational \nforms, such as hierarchical performance management and competition between providers.  \nCrosby and Bryson (2005) recognize this when they identify the rather different leadership skills \nrequired in arenas and courts as compared to forums.  Notable in relation to their example of the \nAfrican-American Men Project in Minnesota was the administrative, decision-making power \nborne by a key leader as an elected official, enabling him to enact political leadership in the \nexecutive arenas concerned (Crosby and Bryson 2005).  Nottley\u2018s lack of such political leadership \nsaw it fail in its bid for resources in the arena of the purchasing decision-makers; Derton\u2018s project \nalmost met a similar fate, saved only by the collective political clout of the network\u2018s powerful \nstakeholders.  The more general, theoretical point in relation to Crosby and Bryson\u2018s (2005) \ncategorization of effective leadership strategies is that while forums may be susceptible to the \nshaping influence of leaders within a network, arenas and courts frequently are not.  As such they \nrequire not just a different style of leadership, but potentially also a different set of leaders \naltogether, with legitimacy and leverage within their domains. \nOur contribution to theory may thus be summarized as follows.  The need for distributed \nleadership, highlighted in the literature in relation to various public-service professional \nbureaucracies, is compounded by the inter-organizational network form.  Leadership needs to be \ndispersed as well as distributed, to engage diverse, powerful stakeholder groups, and this implies a \nvariety of leaders as well as leadership styles.  The inter-organizational network itself is ineffective \nas a means of achieving change, but it does provide the space and the media for leaders to effect \nchange.  However, this space is a constricted one, and at its boundaries are other organizational \nforms, with their pressures on actors and corresponding norms of behavior.  Consequently \ndistributed and dispersed leadership are often not enough to achieve change, if change rests also \non the decisions and behaviors of those governed by the pressures of these other organizational \nforms.  The arenas and courts outside the network, in Crosby and Bryson\u2018s (2005) terms, may \nrequire not only a different form of leadership, but also a different tranche of leaders.  This last \npoint may relate especially to countries such as the UK and much of continental Europe, where \nthe remnants of traditional, centralized systems coexist alongside the network form, though as we \nhave seen, it is also relevant in relation to the coexistence of networks and markets. \nOn a practical level, certain specific lessons for the health sector also have broader \nimplications for the operation of public-service networks more generally.  In the health services \nof the UK, US and other countries, \u2015the relative power of specialists has diminished as primary \ncare physicians have assumed a more central role as the initial contact point with patients and as \nmajor decision makers regarding referrals to specialists and sites of care throughout the system\u2016 \n(Shortell et al. 2000, 79).  In the UK, policymakers are currently seeking to consolidate this new-\nfound power of primary-care physicians and purchasers, so that they might become the drivers of \nhealth-service change.  However, evident from both these studies was the degree to which \nprimary-care actors were sidelined within the networks and in service reform.  The marginality of \nthis locus of power was instrumental in Nottley\u2018s failure and almost derailed Derton\u2018s project \ntoo, and in more general terms, the need for policymakers to align incentives and levers, through \nintegration or centralization within the network, is strong (Provan and Milward 1995; Milward \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review. The definitive publisher-authenticated \nversion is available online at http:\/\/jpart.oxfordjournals.org\/. \u00a9 2009 The authors \n \n19 \nand Provan 1998; Provan et al. 2004; Keast and Brown 2006).  Client-level networking between \npractitioners (Provan and Sebastian 1998) needs to be supported by organizational integration \nthat supports practitioners\u2018 efforts and enables the establishment of change in the face of \nprevailing institutional pressures.  Inter alia, this means that notwithstanding their contractually \nbased relationship, organizations on both sides of purchaser-provider relationships need to be \nincorporated in the structures, and inculcated in the ethos, of the network. \nConclusion \nOur study is based on relatively thin empirical data, and so should be interpreted cautiously, \nespecially in terms of the additions to existing theory suggested.  Many of the findings, though, \nconfirm existing evidence; moreover the findings on the importance of distributed leadership \nfrom these two case studies are mirrored in data from our wider study of 11 sites.   Our findings \nindicate that despite the well documented obstacles to networked governance and distributed \nleadership in the public services, a careful alignment of objectives with managerial agenda can \nbring success to reforms in service provision.  A combination of clear benefits to wider \nstakeholders within the network, and distributed and dispersed leadership, can give rise to \neffective collaboration and establishment of reforms, through structural integration and the \nharnessing of agency.  To this extent, policies invoking structure and agency were indeed \nsynergistic.  However, the relationship was a contingent one, illustrating how network-based \nreforms to organizational structure are both potentially powerful and simultaneously impotent: \npowerful in creating a space within which certain enactments of leadership might flourish and \nachieve service reform; impotent as instruments of that reform in themselves, as a means of \nchanging practice in the face of the much more powerful, informal structures that are \ndeterminant of behavior (Sandfort 2000; Riccucci 2005).  Furthermore the space for effective \nleadership created was a limited one, which became more and more constricted in the face of \ncoexistent organizational forms and modes of governance.  Networks compound the need for \ndistributed leadership in public-service contexts since they introduce new loci of power that \nmight be influenced by a more dispersed form of leadership.  However, the coexistence of \nnetworks alongside other organizational forms constricts the effectiveness of this mode of \nleadership, and it is likely that in many settings, complementary modes of leadership that \nconform with the requirements of these other organizational forms may be required. \nOur study adds to a growing literature on the practice of leadership and the role of \nnetworks in public-service organizations, and brings these literatures together to highlight the \npotentials for and impediments to leadership in public-service networks.  As we noted in our \nopening section, as policies focused on transforming the structures of public-service provision \nand the agency of public servants respectively, networks and leadership seem to some extent \ncomplementary.  The tangible success of distributed, quiet leadership, and dispersed change \nagency, in one case, indicates how these two policies can indeed work synergistically.  The less \nsuccessful efforts of the second case, illustrate the fragility of this complementarity. \nIn terms of policy, our study reaffirms the importance of carefully aligned policy levers that \nensure that organizations within networks have drivers which incline them towards networked \ncollaboration rather than operation within their silos.  In health, the gap between hospital and \nprimary care would seem to be a particularly important one in terms of divergent drivers and ill-\naligned incentives, reflecting the uneven influence of network-based organizational forms in \nother sectors, especially those characterized by market or quasi-market relationships.  For \norganizations and practitioners, then, the key message is around ensuring the functionality of \nnetworks, and the importance of locating those crucial change agents whose influence might be \nharnessed towards service reform.  Finally, we hope our study illustrates the distinctive \ncontribution of qualitative study (cf. Bryman 2004), even as it highlights the need for further \ninvestigation of the processes by which individual agency interacts with structural reconfiguration \nThis is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in Journal of \nPublic Administration Research & Theory following peer review.
