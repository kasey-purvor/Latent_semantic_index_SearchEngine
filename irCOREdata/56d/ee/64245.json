The complexity is 30 \nconfounded by its spatial heterogeneity both over the Earth\u2019s land surface but also with depth. 31 \nSoil is a continuum covering the earth\u2019s surface, not a discrete set of entities, and most soil is 32 \nbelow ground and not readily visible (Buol et al. 2003).  The complexity of the natural systems is 33 \nmanifested in the subject of soil science, which involves the study of complicated interrelated 34 \nand interdependent processes (Shainberg 2000). Soil science is interdisciplinary and includes 35 \nsoil physics, soil chemistry, soil pedology, and soil biology. 36 \nSoil degradation is the long term decline in soil\u2019s current or future productivity and its 37 \nenvironment moderating capacity (Lal 1994; Lal 1997; Lal 2001; Oldeman 1988). The main soil 38 \ndegradation processes include soil erosion by water and wind, development of extreme soil 39 \nreaction (acidification, salinisation\/alkalization), physical degradation (structural destruction, 40 \ncompaction, extreme moisture regime), biological degradation, unfavourable changes in the 41 \nnutrient regime, decrease of buffering capacity, and contamination from natural or 42 \nanthropogenic sources (Blum 1997; V\u00e1rallya 1989). Major threats for soil in Europe, highlighted 43 \nin the EU soil thematic strategy, are erosion, decline in organic matter, local and diffuse 44 \ncontamination, sealing, compaction, decline in biodiversity, salinisation, floods and landslides 45 \n(European Commission (EC) 2006b). Soil degradation normally signifies a change or 46 \ndisturbance of soil quality, implying decline in quality and capacity of soil through natural or 47 \nanthropogenic perturbations (Johnson et al. 1997; Lal 2009).  48 \nThere is a move toward protection of soils to the same extent as water and air and to promote 49 \nsustainable use of soil (Blum 2003; Quevauviller and Olazabal 2003). This increased 50 \nimportance of soil in environmental disciplines has occurred for a number of reasons. The 51 \ndrivers for this rise has been a proliferation of contaminated land legislation, soil geography and 52 \nsoil-geographical zoning, agricultural soil management zone identification, and environmental 53 \nimpact assessments and strategic environmental assessment taking into account soil quality, 54 \ntheir characterisation and management (Fleming et al. 2000; Glasson et al. 2005; Nathanail and 55 \n \n \nBardos 2004; Urusevskaya 2007; Wood 2003). Soil is the basis of economic and cultural 56 \nactivities; however the economic value of soil has not adequately been recognised (G\u00f6rlach et 57 \nal. 2004). Due to the fundamental link between soil and the economy there are many economic 58 \nactivities that depend both directly and indirectly on soil quality including agriculture, industry 59 \nand tourism. These economic activities could benefit from development of soil quality 60 \nassessment methods, action prioritisation systems, and more generally from sustainable soil 61 \nuse and conservation.  62 \nCountries including the USA, Japan, Canada, Australia, Brazil and a number of developing 63 \ncountries have established soil protection policies (European Commission (EC) 2006a). 64 \nLegislation aiming to protect soils in Europe includes the soil thematic strategy (European 65 \nCommission (EC) 2006b), and the proposed soil framework directive (European Commission, 66 \n2006b). In addition in the UK reform to the cross compliance good agricultural and 67 \nenvironmental condition (GAEC) standards is taking place to strengthen soils protection 68 \n(Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2009),and a code of practice for 69 \nthe sustainable use of soils on construction sites has been developed  (Department for 70 \nEnvironment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2008).  71 \nA number of EU member states have legislation that alludes to soil protection; however the 72 \nmajority of this is focused on soil contamination. A number of states do have policies addressing 73 \nbroader soil protection issues including Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. These states are 74 \nsome of the most advanced states for soil protection in EU, and found in a survey in 2003 to be 75 \nthe only states with a specific legally binding definition of soil (Van-Camp et al. 2003).  The 76 \nNetherlands have a number of policies to address long term protection, management and 77 \nsustainable use of soils including the 1987 soil protection act (amended 2008) (VROM (The 78 \nNetherlands Ministry of Housing, Physical Planning and the Environment) 1986), the 2003 Soil 79 \nPolicy Letter (van Geel 2003) and the 2009 soil remediation circular (VROM (The Netherlands 80 \nMinistry of Housing, Physical Planning and the Environment) 2009). German policy for the 81 \nprotection of soils include the 1998 Federal Soil protection act (Federal Ministry for the 82 \nEnvironment Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety 1998), and the 1999 Federal Soil 83 \n \n \nProtection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance (Federal Ministry for the Environment Nature 84 \nConservation and Nuclear Safety 1999). There are a number of government agencies that have 85 \nbeen established for soil protection, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural 86 \nResources formally established in 1975 and the Federal Environment Agency Soil Protection 87 \nCommission (KBU) in 2004. The Public Waste Agency of Flanders (OVAM) of the Flanders 88 \nregion of Belgium developed a soil remediation and protection decree in 2007, replacing a 89 \nprevious version of 1995 (Public Waste Agency of Flanders (OVAM) 2007). The Flemish 90 \ngovernment approved the 'Order of the Flemish Government establishing the Flemish regulation 91 \non soil remediation and soil protection' that accompanied the decree in December 2007 92 \n(Flemish Government 2007), replacing the previous version of 1995.  93 \nThe soil framework directive proposes integration of soils into all policy making, prevention of 94 \ndegradation and pollution of soils, implementation of risk\/priority areas and action programmes 95 \nfor erosion, compaction, loss of organic matter, salinisation, acidification and landslides, 96 \nlimitation and containment of soil sealing, and identification and remediation of contaminated 97 \nsites (de Souza 2009). The proposed directive will require identification of risk areas on the 98 \nbasis of common elements, encouraging use of existing monitoring schemes with a move 99 \ntoward development of a harmonised monitoring approach (European Commission (EC) 100 \n2006c). There is general support for a Framework directive on soil protection, with the majority 101 \nof states holding the view that the proposed directive will fill a gap in Union environmental 102 \nlegislation and provide a more holistic approach to soil protection (Council of the European 103 \nUnion 2010). Development of the soil framework has, however, been slow for a number of 104 \nreasons including problems agreeing on an approach for identifying geographical \u201crisk areas\" or 105 \n\"priority areas\" (ENDS Europe 2007). A knowledge based approach to soil monitoring aimed at 106 \ndelivering soil protection and sustainable use is introduced and required by the soil thematic 107 \nstrategy (Blum et al. 2004a; Blum et al. 2004b; Quevauviller and Olazabal 2003).  108 \nDespite the relatively recent introduction of policies for its protection, soil is an environmental 109 \nmedium that is often neglected, because there is not widespread understanding of the 110 \nimportance it has for ecosystems and the economy (Dimas and Gnacadja 2008). Despite the 111 \n \n \nincrease in environmental awareness, the same cannot be shown of the general society\u2019s 112 \nattitude toward soil {160 Ferreira, M. da G. de V. X. 2006}}.  The public\u2019s knowledge of, and 113 \ninterest in other environmental media such as air and water are higher than of soils. For the 114 \ncase of air, the level of knowledge is mainly because of the impact on public perception of the 115 \nhistory of air pollution and dramatic local events (Brimblecombe 2001). Similarly, water is 116 \nperceived as very important and has played its part in both historical and current conflicts 117 \n(Gleick 2008). The link between human health and both air and water quality has been a driver 118 \nfor developing public perception and the need for environmental regulations.   119 \nEven when conflicts have been associated with the availability of arable land and farm 120 \nproduction, soil has never properly understood or perceived as important. On the contrary, soil 121 \nhas often been pushed to the background in public commitment to environmental conservation. 122 \nThis is in part due to the unaddressed problem of clearly defining soil, and the more 123 \ncomplicated issue of defining or assessing its quality. The links to the environment and human 124 \nhealth are not evident for soil to the same extent as water and air. Soil is often taken for granted 125 \nand often mistakenly confused with dirt. There is a need for defining and communicating a 126 \nricher, more broadly nuanced, and positive societal value of soil and its quality.  127 \nIn an effort to protect soils through encouraging development of soil protection policy and 128 \nlegislation there is a need to clearly define soil and in order to assess the state of degradation to 129 \nunderstand the term soil quality. This paper aimed to increase understanding of soil and soil 130 \nquality through review of the definition of soil and developments in the definition of soil quality 131 \nand its assessment. The paper summarises concerns that have emerged following a phase of 132 \ndevelopment since the initial definition of soil quality in the 1970\u2019s. The historical review was 133 \nundertaken to understand the difficulties in defining soil quality as well as problems and 134 \nconcerns with assessment of soil quality. The review incorporates major concerns and unease 135 \nin the field of soil quality and developments in the field of environmental protection to refine the 136 \ndefinition of soil quality. This work has suggested development of a complimentary method to 137 \ninform and prioritise further detailed assessment of soil\u2019s quality.   138 \n \n \nThis review is particularly relevant due to the simultaneous development of a number of country 139 \nspecific legislative instruments for soil protection and particularly with the emergence of 140 \nEuropean legislative drivers.  The work has relevance to the situation surrounding the proposed 141 \nframework directive on soil protection. As such the concepts presented in this work have 142 \npotential EU- wide application, with relevance at member state level but more importantly for 143 \nharmonisation across states.    144 \nSoil and Soil Quality 145 \nThere is some variability in the definition of soil; a selection of definitions is presented in Table 146 \n1. An early legislative definition by the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Physical Planning and 147 \nthe Environment (VROM) is a simple statement about the physical nature of the soil; a definition 148 \nvery similar to that of the Public Waste Agency of Flanders. The German Federal Ministry for 149 \nthe Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety definition is more detailed than that 150 \nof the Netherlands and Flanders, and includes not only the physical components of soil but 151 \nreference to soil\u2019s function. The Soil Science Society of America provides the definition that is 152 \naccepted by the US Department of Agriculture and this definition of soil demonstrates the 153 \ncomplex and multifaceted nature of soils (Soil Science Glossary Terms Committee 2008) The 154 \ndefinition as used by the Environment Agency of England and Wales (EA) introduces the idea 155 \nthat soil is often seen as a resource, and therefore can be exploited (Environment Agency 156 \n2004). The definition in the proposed soil framework directive (in the proposal of the Czech 157 \npresidency) text is restricted to the chemical, physical and biological aspects of the soil, not 158 \nmentioning function or economic production.  159 \nTable 1 Definitions of soil in legislation and literature. 160 \nA lot of research has been undertaken to understand soil and describe its characteristics in 161 \nmore general terms. For example, the chemical function of soil has been assessed on national, 162 \nregional and local levels by use of geochemical mapping (Barraclough 2007; Johnson et al. 163 \n2005). The technique was developed in the 1950\u2019s to give information on the spatial distribution 164 \nof chemical elements and compounds at the earth\u2019s surface (Johnson and Ander 2008). In 165 \n \n \ngeneral, there has been a great deal of work to investigate simplified functions and processes of 166 \nsoil science; these however are regularly limited to the specific sub discipline such as soil 167 \nphysics, soil biology or soil chemistry. There is a need to review the advances and development 168 \nin the term soil quality, to define how the term relates to the uses of land and to anthropogenic 169 \nactivities.  170 \nThe potential effects upon other media from the soil system have the ability to influence 171 \ncompliance with regulatory standards such as the European Union Water Framework Directive 172 \nwhich sets controls on the diffuse pollution from soil (European Commission (EC) 2006b).  A 173 \nmethod for prioritisation of impacts to groundwater from soils on a city wide scale is being 174 \ndeveloped by the British Geological Survey that takes into account factors including soil 175 \nproperties and soil metal concentration from urban soil survey data (\u00d3\u2019Dochartaigh et al. 2009).  176 \nDespite the great deal of research into specific aspects of soil\u2019s quality, most of this work 177 \ndefines and assesses soil quality based on different simplified functions and processes of soil 178 \nitself. An example of this is the agricultural land classification developed implemented in the UK 179 \nto assess quality of agricultural land taking into account climate, site and soil characteristics and 180 \nthe interactions between them (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 1988). Another 181 \nexample is the great increase in research into, and investigation of, contaminated land since the 182 \n1970\u2019s. This was mainly a reaction to a number of high profile contamination incidents that 183 \nattracted media attention, such as Love Canal and Times Beach in the USA, Lekkerkerk in the 184 \nNetherlands, Minimata in Japan, and incidents in the UK such as the landfill gas explosion at 185 \nLoscoe, redevelopment of a munitions factory in Enfield, the detection of hexachlorobutadiene 186 \nin houses in Cheshire, and The Corby Litigation Group v Corby District Council case concerning 187 \nreclamation of a former steel works in Corby (Nathanail and Bardos 2004; Williams and 188 \nAitkenhead 1991).  The increase in contaminated land research is also due to an increase in 189 \ndevelopment of Brownfield sites, inclusion of contaminated land as a consideration in the 190 \nplanning process, and a willingness of companies to identify environmental liabilities (Alker et al. 191 \n2000; Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2002; Harrison and Hester 192 \n2001).  193 \n \n \nContaminated land has the potential to pose serious environmental risks, including surface and 194 \ngroundwater contamination, and risks to human health and safety (Balasubramaniam et al. 195 \n2007). Although likely to be covered in future holistic soil protection regimes contaminated land 196 \nis just one aspect of soil quality. It has traditionally had a separate legislative area with its own 197 \nrelated legislation and policy, independent from that of soil science and soil quality. 198 \nEnvironmental standards used to assess contaminated land should not be confused with 199 \nassessment of soil quality. The contaminated land legislative area includes not only legislation 200 \nspecific to contaminated land but also general environmental, waste and resources, health 201 \nprotection, and planning and building control.  Exhaustive lists of contaminated land legislation 202 \nare available from state governments; however examples of the main acts relating to 203 \ncontaminated land in a number of European states are detailed in Table 2.  204 \nTable 2 Examples of main contaminated land legislation in EU member states 205 \nThere are some states with legislation specific to contaminated soil, and a number of states that 206 \nhave overarching soil protection legislation; however these still focus to a large extent on soil 207 \ncontamination. The legislative framework in EU member states has similarities in investigation 208 \nof presumed contamination; mostly following a similar stepwise approach with preliminary 209 \ninvestigation followed by detailed investigation and remediation (Provoost et al. 2006). Soil 210 \ncleanup standards are seen as a trigger for detailed investigation and remediation, however 211 \nthese values vary in derivation and application across member states.  For the case of soil 212 \nquality indicators, apart from contaminant concentration, trigger values for action have mostly 213 \nnot been adequately researched and there is a lack of implementation so far within member 214 \nstates (UK Soil Indicators Consortium 2006). 215 \nTo support development of national contaminated land management programmes, a likely 216 \nrequirement of the EU SFD (European Commission (EC) 2006c) a driver-pressure-state-impact-217 \nresponse (D-P-S-I-R) framework has been suggested to provide an information framework to 218 \nsupport interventions on contaminated land management at a national level and the source- 219 \npathway- receptor model to provide guidance at a site level (Rodrigues et al. 2009). This 220 \n \n \nmethod would meet the requirement in the proposed SFD of identification of contaminated sites 221 \nbut would not go so far as to meet the requirement to identify geographical risk or priority areas. 222 \nHowever, this identification will not be carried out by environmental policy itself and is likely to 223 \nrequire the development and use of additional tools.   224 \nPresence of contaminants from diffuse sources potentially present below traditional risk 225 \nscreening levels should not be overlooked. Although through risk assessment the presence of 226 \nthese contaminants is not necessarily considered a threat to human health, their presence can 227 \nimpact upon other aspects of soil quality such as soil biodiversity (van Straalen and van Gestel 228 \n2008). Diffuse pollution of soils also has the potential to exacerbate the impact of other soil 229 \nquality aspects such as erosion, leaching and run off and ultimately upon a number of soil 230 \nfunctions (Quevauviller 2007).  231 \nSoil quality needs to include such contamination aspects, within a holistic assessment approach 232 \nthat includes other aspects of soil quality. As previously stated, soil degradation can be defined 233 \nas a decline in soil quality, and major soil degradation processes are erosion, decline in organic 234 \nmatter, local and diffuse contamination, sealing, compaction, decline in biodiversity, salinisation, 235 \nfloods and landslides. Ultimately extreme degradation leads to desertification, an advanced 236 \nstage of land degradation where the soil has lost part of its capability to support human 237 \ncommunities and ecosystems (European Environment Agency (EEA) 1999). These soil 238 \ndegradation processes can, therefore, be seen as key threats to decline in soil quality and seen 239 \nas a key focus of the definition, identification and assessment of soil quality.  240 \nHistorical Review of Assessment of Soil Quality 241 \nProposals to assess soil quality emerged initially in the USA. An early proponent of the concept 242 \nwas Alexander (Alexander 1971) who first suggested developing soil quality criteria. The 243 \ndevelopment of the definition of soil quality over time is detailed in Table 3.  244 \nTable 3 Development of the definition of soil quality  245 \n \n \nThe report \u201cA framework for land evaluation\u201d by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of 246 \nthe United Nations defined land quality as \u201ca complex attribute of land which acts in a distinct 247 \nmanner in its influence on the suitability of land for a specific kind of use\u201d (Food and Agriculture 248 \nOrganisation (FAO) 1976). The FAO report introduced the idea that land quality is complex and 249 \nshould be assessed in relation to the specific function that the land serves Carter et al. (Carter 250 \net al. 1997) outlined the differences between land and soil quality whereby soil quality is more 251 \nrestrictive than land quality but frequently incorporates the same emphasis on use.  252 \nWarkentin and Fletcher (Warkentin and Fletcher 1977) developed soil quality as initially 253 \nsuggested by Alexander (Alexander 1971) by integrating the relationship of soil quality with the 254 \nland function. The authors stated that assessment of soil quality was needed to facilitate better 255 \nland use planning because of the increasing number of functions that soil resources must either 256 \nprovide or accommodate. Warkentin and Fletcher (Warkentin and Fletcher 1977) recognised 257 \nthe value of soils in the biosphere and stated that soils have not only current use value but also 258 \nshould have an intrinsic value. The relationship between soil quality and environmental quality is 259 \nevident in the Anderson and Gregorich (Anderson and Gregorich 1984) definition. 260 \nLarson and Pierce (Larson and Pierce 1991) along with their definition of soil quality suggest a 261 \nminimum data set of soil parameters which could be used to express the 'health' of a soil. The 262 \nLarson and Pierce (Larson and Pierce 1991) definition introduces soil health, a term that can be 263 \nused interchangeably with the term soil quality. The term soil quality, however, is one used 264 \nmore regularly by soil scientists and soil health used by other parties. The phrases, although 265 \nused interchangeably, do however have different emphasis. Karlen et al. (Karlen et al. 1997b) 266 \nstate that soil quality can be viewed as an inherent characteristic of the soil, or as the condition 267 \nor \u201chealth\u201d of the soil. However, the difference in emphasis between soil health and soil 268 \ncondition was highlighted in Mausbach and Tugel (Mausbach and Tugel 1995) with soil health 269 \ndiffering from soil condition whereby soil health \u201cis the ability of the soil to perform according to 270 \nits potential. Soil condition changes over time due to human use and management or to unusual 271 \nnatural events\u201d.  272 \n \n \nSeybold et al. (Seybold et al. 1998) suggested that soil quality evokes various responses 273 \ndepending on scientific and social background. To the land manager and farmer, soil quality is 274 \noften viewed as that of soil health (Romig 1995). Soil health is a term preferred by some as it 275 \nportrays soil as a living, dynamic system whose function is mediated by a diversity of living 276 \norganisms that require management and conservation (Doran and Zeiss 2000). Doran and 277 \nZeiss (Doran and Zeiss 2000) state that the term soil quality is associated with a soil\u2019s fitness for 278 \nuse and the term soil health is associated with the capacity of a soil to function as a vital living 279 \nsystem, to sustain biological productivity, promote environmental quality and maintain plant and 280 \nanimal health.  281 \nPierce and Lal (Pierce and Lal 1992) differentiated between the intrinsic properties of a soil as 282 \ndetermined by the soils development and degradation processes, and the soils productivity 283 \ndescribing the efficiency in use and management of resource inputs.   284 \nThe classification of soil quality as \u201cfitness for use\u201d aligns soil quality assessment with soil 285 \nfunction (Pierce and Larson 1993). Assessment of soil quality requires the intended soil use to 286 \nbe determined in order to establish the soils capacity to function (Schoenholtz et al. 2000). 287 \nRecent and proposed soil protection policy requires action on threats to soil with regard to the 288 \nsoil function (Blum et al. 2004a; de Souza 2009). Carter et al. (Carter et al. 1997) suggested a 289 \nframework for evaluating soil quality that includes describing each soil function on which quality 290 \nis to be used, selecting soil characteristics of properties that influence the capacity of the soil to 291 \nprovide each function, choosing indicators of characteristics that can be measured, and using 292 \nmethods that provide accurate measurement of those indicators.  293 \nThe Doran and Parkin (Doran and Parkin 1994) definition includes not only soils ability to 294 \nfunction, but includes key soil functions in the definition. A widely used definition of soil quality is 295 \nthat of Karlen et al. (Karlen et al. 2001), the product of a Soil Science Society of America 296 \n(SSSA) Ad Hoc Committee on Soil Quality (S-581). The result of the committee on soil quality is 297 \nclearly based upon the Doran and Parkin (Doran and Parkin 1994) definition.  The Karlen et al. 298 \n(Karlen et al. 1997a) definition is used widely by the United States Department of Agriculture 299 \n \n \nincluding in their recent technical note (USDA- NRCS 2008). The definitions from both Doran 300 \nand Parkin (Doran and Parkin 1994) and Karlen et al. (Karlen et al. 1997b) include dynamic soil 301 \nquality, a term that refers to the condition of soil that is changeable in a short period of time by 302 \nhuman impact including agricultural management practices (Idowu et al. 2008; Seybold et al. 303 \n1998).  304 \nPatzel et al. (Patzel et al. 2000) attempted to make a distinction between soil fertility and soil 305 \nquality for the German language literature. The distinction of soil quality from soil fertility was 306 \nrecommended to prevent ideal attributes in soils being included in the definition of soil fertility 307 \nand to reduce confusion associated with the two terms as has been seen in the USA.  308 \nIn the USA the establishment, in 1993, of a Soil Quality Institute (SQI) provided the United 309 \nStates Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) with 310 \nan emphasis on soil quality. The SQI has a mission to develop and disseminate tools for soil 311 \nquality assessment (Ditzler and Tugel 2002). 312 \nIn summary soil quality has developed from the suggestion by Alexander (Alexander 1971) that 313 \nsoil quality criteria should be developed, later in the 1970\u2019s it was suggested that soil quality 314 \nshould be evaluated in relation to land function (Warkentin and Fletcher 1977). The interaction 315 \nwith holistic environmental quality, water and air quality was discussed in the mid 1980\u2019s 316 \n(Anderson and Gregorich 1984).  There was much discussion of the subject in the 1990\u2019s 317 \nincluding suggestion of minimum data sets for assessment, discussion about the differences 318 \nbetween soil health and soil quality, and a differentiation between the intrinsic properties of a 319 \nsoil and soils productivity as a result of management practices (Doran and Zeiss 2000; Karlen et 320 \nal. 1997b; Larson and Pierce 1991; Mausbach and Tugel 1995; Pierce and Lal 1992; Romig 321 \n1995; Seybold et al. 1998). Doran and Parkin (Doran and Parkin 1994) and  Pierce and Larson 322 \n(Pierce and Larson 1993) developed the definition further by including key soil functions, the 323 \nfitness for use and the dynamic state of soils in the definition of soil quality, which clearly 324 \ninspired later definitions (Karlen et al. 1997b; USDA- NRCS 2008), and soil protection policy 325 \n(Blum et al. 2004a; de Souza 2009).  326 \n \n \nConcern over the definition of soil quality 327 \nDespite formation of a soil quality institute in the USA and a large amount of discussion 328 \npredominantly attempting to define soil quality, consensus amongst the scientific community on 329 \na precise definition of soil quality has not been reached (Ditzler and Tugel 2002). This is likely to 330 \nbe due to the innate difficulty\n \nin the definition of soil and the complex nature (i.e.,\n \nscientific, 331 \npersonal, and social) of environmental concerns (Carter 2002). 332 \nFollowing the large amount of work to define soil quality, there has more recently been some 333 \ndispute about the relevance and impact of soil quality. MacEwan and Carter (MacEwan and 334 \nCarter 1996) and Carter (Carter 2002) stated that although soil quality\n \ndescribes an objective 335 \nstate or condition of the soil, it also\n \nis subjective, evaluated partly on the basis of personal\n \nand 336 \nsocial determinations. Doran and Parkin (Doran and Parkin 1996) described that in the 5 years 337 \npreceding the publication there had been concern about deficiencies in the basic understanding 338 \nof soil quality and a lack of a mechanistically based soil quality methodology, particularly of the 339 \nsoil biota.  340 \nSojka and Upchurch (Sojka and Upchurch 1999) expressed concern over the move in soil 341 \nscience from value neutral tradition of edaphology, and specific problem solving to paradigm 342 \nbased on variable and often subjective societal perceptions of environmental holism. Sojka and 343 \nUpchurch (Sojka and Upchurch 1999) suggested that although soil quality does acknowledge 344 \nthe variable soil functions it fails to integrate simultaneous, diverse and often conflicting soil 345 \nfunctions and emphasises the importance of understanding rather than rating of the soil 346 \nresource. Conflicts occurring for example between agricultural production or use as a platform 347 \nfor construction and functioning as an environmental buffer and store of water.   348 \nConcerns expressed by Karlen et al. (Karlen et al. 2001) emphasise the lack of inclusion of soil 349 \nfunctions and meaningful indicators for those functions. Karlen et al. (Karlen et al. 2001) 350 \ndiscussed the difficulty in interpreting indicators for various soil functions that can be used to 351 \ntrack soil quality over time. Letey et al. (Letey et al. 2003) expressed that soil quality has a 352 \ndysfunctional definition, that there are problems in the approach to quantification of soil quality. 353 \n \n \nLetey et al. (Letey et al. 2003) agreed with Sojka and Upchurch (Sojka and Upchurch 1999)who 354 \nstated there is a failure of soil quality to integrate simultaneous soil functions which often require 355 \ncontradictory soil properties and management, for example high levels of mineralisable 356 \nnitrogen\/ low levels of nitrate nitrogen and levels of available nitrogen to crops (Karlen et al. 357 \n1997b).   358 \nSojka et al. (Sojka et al. 2003) expresses many of the concerns in earlier literature including 359 \nthose about the elusiveness and value-laden nature of the soil quality definition. The work 360 \nreiterates concerns expressed by earlier studies into the often multiple functions of soils that 361 \noccur simultaneously and that development of soil quality assessment has diverted research 362 \nand management away from developing improved management to solve problems.  363 \nThere have been issues defining the boundaries of assessment when evaluating soil quality. 364 \nRather than focusing on ability to carry out specific functions increasingly issues such as the 365 \nenvironmental cost of agricultural production and the potential for reclamation of degraded soils 366 \nis considered when discussing soil quality (Singer and Ewing 2000).  367 \nSoil Functions  368 \nAs described by critics of soil quality, soil can have multiple functions. Sojka and Upchurch 369 \n(Sojka and Upchurch 1999) describe how soil performs several functions simultaneously not 370 \nseveral functions separately.  Letey et al. (Letey et al. 2003) described how soil may perform 371 \nwell for one function and badly for another function that is occurring simultaneously. Letey et al. 372 \n(Letey et al. 2003) describes how Karlen (Karlen et al. 1997a) acknowledged problems with 373 \nassessing soils multiple functions when reviewing Doran and Werner (Doran and Werner 1990) 374 \nwhere the soil management was affecting the rating and performance of two functions.  375 \nThere is considerable overlap in the functions of soil as expressed in the literature, though 376 \nexpressed in different wording the soil functions expressed by different sources cover the same 377 \nareas:  378 \n \n \n\uf0b7 Maintains biological activity and productivity (Doran and Parkin 1994; Karlen et al. 379 \n1997b), serves as a medium for plant\/food\/fibre growth (European Commission (EC) 380 \n2006b; Larson and Pierce 1991; Loveland and Thompson 2002), supports plant 381 \nproductivity\/yield (Karlen et al. 1997b), supports human\/animal health (Doran and 382 \nParkin 1994; Karlen et al. 1997b);  383 \n\uf0b7 Acts as a biodiversity and gene pool (European Commission (EC) 2006b; Lal 1997; Lal 384 \n1998; Montanarella 2008) 385 \n\uf0b7 partitions and regulates water\/solute flow through the environment (Karlen et al. 1997a; 386 \nLarson and Pierce 1991);  387 \n\uf0b7 serves as an environmental buffer or filter (European Commission (EC) 2006b; Larson 388 \nand Pierce 1991; Loveland and Thompson 2002), maintains environmental quality 389 \n(Doran and Parkin 1994; Karlen et al. 1997a)(Karlen et al. 1997a){{181 Karlen, D.L. 390 \n1997}}(Karlen et al. 1997a);  391 \n\uf0b7 cycles nutrients, water, energy and other elements through the biosphere (Karlen et al. 392 \n1997a);  393 \n\uf0b7 supports socioeconomic structure, cultural and aesthetic values, (Lal 1998) and a 394 \nplatform for human activities and landscape (European Commission (EC) 2006b; 395 \nSombroek and Sims 1995)(Sombroek and Sims 1995){{231 Sombroek, W.G. 396 \n1995}}(Sombroek and Sims 1995);  397 \n\uf0b7 an archive of heritage (European Commission (EC) 2006b; Lal 1998; Sombroek and 398 \nSims 1995).  399 \nLal (Lal 2007) reviewed the scientific literature and classified soil function research into the 400 \nthemes of food security, bio fuels production, waste disposal, carbon, farming, and water 401 \nresources.  402 \nThe soil functions that have been suggested in the literature generally fit in with the definition of 403 \necosystem services, the benefits that human beings gain from natural ecosystems as defined 404 \nby Daily (Daily 2000). Ecosystem services can be categorised as the production of goods, 405 \n \n \nregeneration processes, stabilizing processes, life fulfilling processes, and preservation of 406 \noptions (Daily 2000).  407 \nSoil quality has connections to other environmental mediums, and the biological systems that 408 \nare supported by the soil. The interconnections can be described as direct or indirect, as 409 \ndetailed in Figure 1.  410 \nFigure 1 Connections between soil health and the environmental and biological systems supported by soil. Direct 411 \n(1a-1d) and Indirect (2a-4a) quality and health connections of soil to air, water, plants, animals, and people (after, 412 \nHarris et al., 1996).  413 \nThe ecological risk assessment process (also referred to as environmental risk assessment) 414 \nevaluates the potential significance of impacts in regard to likely effects upon ecological 415 \nreceptors as the result of exposure to a stressor (Hope 2006; Suter 2007). Ecological risk 416 \nassessment includes evaluation of ecological aspects for each soil use to formulate soil 417 \nscreening values based upon soil use (European Chemicals Bureau 2002; Quercia et al. 2002).  418 \nToxicity of contaminated soils has become a major focus in ecological risk assessment, and can 419 \nbe used to set generic or site-specific soil quality guidelines and for guiding on-site 420 \ncontamination mapping and remediation (Burns et al. 1996; Suter 2000). Toxicity data informing 421 \necological risk assessment can be comprised of single-chemical or single material data; 422 \nambient media toxicity, site-specific insitu or laboratory toxicity tests of contaminated media; or 423 \nbiological survey, site specific sampling or observations of organisms, populations or 424 \ncommunities in contaminated areas(Suter 2000). Increasingly use of single bioassays have 425 \nbeen found not to provide a full enough picture of the quality of the environment, therefore 426 \nbattery tests of a number of bioassays of different animal and plant species from different 427 \ntrophic levels have been used to reduce uncertainty(Bierkens et al. 1998; Juvonen et al. 2000). 428 \nAlthough bioassays have been used extensively in assessing the effects of contaminants in soil, 429 \nuse in assessment of other aspects of soil quality have been limited (Schloter et al. 2003; 430 \nSeybold et al. 1998). It has been suggested that bio assays should not be used as the only 431 \nmeasure of soil quality. The response of a bioasay is a function of many confounding non-soil 432 \nfactors in addition to soil quality. Soil sustainability and the effects of management should be 433 \n \n \ndetermined by measuring soil properties and processes directly (Burger 1996; Seybold et al. 434 \n1998).   435 \nSoil Quality Indicators 436 \nSoils have chemical, biological and physical properties that interact in a complex way to give 437 \nsoil its capacity to function (Seybold et al. 1998). Owing to the wide scope of functions 438 \nencompassed in the definition of soil quality, it is not possible to directly assess soil quality 439 \n(Burger and Kelting 1999; Ditzler and Tugel 2002; Doran and Parkin 1994). Existing methods 440 \nhave first identified the functions of interest and selected indicators to observe and measure, 441 \ninferring the ability of the soil to perform that function (Ditzler and Tugel 2002). The use of 442 \nindicators of soil quality has been discussed widely in the literature and minimum data sets 443 \nsuggested in a number of studies (Arshad and Cohen 1992; Bouma 1989; Doran and Parkin 444 \n1994; Larson and Pierce 1991).  445 \nCommon to the minimum data sets of soil quality indicators suggested in the literature is that 446 \nthey include a combination of physical, chemical and biological soil properties. This suggests 447 \nthat for a soil to function effectively all three factors must be addressed, as illustrated in Figure 2 448 \n(Ditzler and Tugel 2002; Stenberg 1998). These classes of properties match the physical, 449 \nchemical and biological soil degradative processes, mechanisms that set in motion the 450 \ndegradative trends (Lal 1997). Typically soil assessment has looked at chemical properties, 451 \nmeasured using chemical indicators, or has looked at properties and indicators specific only to 452 \nthe function of interest.  Holistic soil quality attempts to integrate the three types of soil 453 \nproperties (Karlen et al. 2003). There is rarely an exact match between function and indicator, 454 \nwith a function often supported by a number of soil properties and a soil property or process 455 \nbeing relevant to several soil attributes or functions simultaneously (Schoenholtz et al. 2000). 456 \nCorrespondingly categories of soil properties (chemical, biological, physical) do not exactly align 457 \nwith the soil functions. The complex interactions between soil properties, indicators, and soil 458 \nfunctions require that for assessment of soil quality integration of soil properties into the soil 459 \nproperty categories is necessary.  460 \n \n \nFigure 2 Relationship between soil quality factors, soil quality and environmental quality (after Andrews et al., 461 \n2002).  462 \nBurger and Kelting (Burger and Kelting 1999) suggested that good indicators should have the 463 \nfollowing features: 464 \n\uf0b7 possess an available baseline against which to compare change; 465 \n\uf0b7 provide a sensitive and timely measure of a soil's ability to function; 466 \n\uf0b7 be applicable over large areas but specific enough to be sensitive; 467 \n\uf0b7 be capable of providing a continuous assessment; 468 \n\uf0b7 be inexpensive, easy to use, collect, and calculate; 469 \n\uf0b7 discriminate between natural changes and those induced by management; 470 \n\uf0b7 be highly correlated to long-term response; and 471 \n\uf0b7 be responsive to corrective measures. 472 \nThe increase in the value of basic data by using it to estimate more expensive and laborious to 473 \nobtain data were named by Bouma (Bouma 1989) as pedotransfer functions (PTFs) and defined 474 \nas translating data we have into what we need. Computer programs such as Soilpar (Acutis and 475 \nDonatelli 2003) and Rosetta (Schaap et al. 2001) were developed to estimate the soil hydraulic 476 \nproperties from surrogate soil data such as soil texture, bulk density, organic carbon, soil pH, 477 \nand cation exchange capacity. Pedotransfer functions were the basis for the development of soil 478 \ninterference systems (SINFERS) that take measurements known with a level of certainty and 479 \ninfer data that is not known with minimal inaccuracy using logically linked predictive functions 480 \n(pedotransfer functions) (McBratney et al. 2002).  481 \nRisk Based Approach to Soil Quality 482 \nRegulatory bodies are increasingly using risk based approaches to environmental decision 483 \nmaking (Pollard et al. 2002).  Such risk based decision making does, to some extent, include 484 \nsoil quality, however this is predominantly in the assessment and management of soil 485 \ncontamination, just one part of soil quality. Although use of risk based methods have not been 486 \nextensively used to assess other aspects of soil quality, the methods and decision making 487 \nprocesses have potential for wider application in soil quality assessment.  488 \n \n \nIn such current soil contamination risk based assessment the effect of contaminants on humans 489 \nand ecosystems is investigated, rather than using the total contaminant concentration in the soil 490 \n(Madej\u00f3n et al. 2006). The source- pathway- receptor pollutant linkage is used in environmental 491 \nrisk assessment and used extensively in the assessment of risks from contaminated land 492 \n(Nathanail and Bardos 2004). In assessment of risk from contaminated land a potential for risk 493 \nexists if there is a source of contaminants, a receptor sensitive to the contaminant at the level of 494 \nexposure present, and a pathway linking the two. A potential risk is said to exist, only if all three 495 \n(source, pathway and receptor) elements are present (Hardisty and \u00d6zdemiro\u01e7lu 2005).  496 \nDefinition of a soil\u2019s quality in terms of the source- pathway- receptor linkage allows potential for 497 \nassessment in terms of the risk posed to or from soil to other environmental mediums, and 498 \nallows the inclusion of soils often multiple functions. Although a function of soil is to act as an 499 \nenvironmental filter (European Commission (EC) 2006b; Larson and Pierce 1991; Loveland and 500 \nThompson 2002) soil has the ability to act as a source, a pathway and a receptor to 501 \ncontaminants. All three aspects being affected by indicators of properties regularly used to 502 \ndetermine soil quality, the linkage, processes and properties are detailed in table 4.  503 \nTable 4 Interaction between risk linkage, soil process, and soil properties  504 \nA contaminant is a substance that is not naturally present in the environment or is present in 505 \nconcentrations with the potential to adversely alter an environment (Saunier and Meganck 506 \n2009). Soil can act as a primary source of contamination, that is a direct flux, or a secondary 507 \nsource by the release of contaminants that have previously affected the soil. The potential of 508 \nsoil to act as a source is highly variable due to the heterogeneous nature of the soil both with 509 \nregard to controlling soil properties but also the chemicals present and their concentration.  The 510 \nnature of soils being dynamic means that there is a flux of chemicals across soil depths (i.e. 511 \nmovement from topsoil to sub soil and the opposite) and spatially. There are constant changes 512 \nin the soil state due to natural leaching processes and interactions\/ fluxes between soil water, 513 \nsoil gas and the organic and mineral components of soil.  514 \n \n \nSoils functioning as a source can occur when water travels through the soil matrix, combined 515 \nwith carbon dioxide to form a weak carbonic acid, acting as a pathway. As the weak carbonic 516 \nacid moves through soil, small amounts of naturally occurring minerals and man-made 517 \nchemicals held within the soil matrix are dissolved and held in solution, a process known as 518 \nleaching (Neung-Hwan and Richter 2004).  Potential receptors can include ground and surface 519 \nwaters, drinking water, humans, animals, services, industrial processes, and household 520 \nappliances. Calcium and magnesium leached from the soil is a cause of \u201chard water\u201d making 521 \nsoaps and detergents less effective and effecting water-using appliances (Boyd 2000). In small 522 \ndoses fluoride, iron, and copper can be beneficial to human health but in larger doses can be 523 \nharmful (Bogden and Klevay 2000). Elements such as lead, arsenic, and mercury are of 524 \nconcern to human health (Alloway 1994). Although carbonic acid is the main leaching agent in 525 \nnatural systems leaching is dependent on the type, quantity and characteristics of the leaching 526 \nagent; there are many natural and anthropogenic lixiviation agents including sulphuric acid, and 527 \nhumic or fulvic acids (Johnson et al. 1979). Alternative leaching agents have been researched 528 \nextensively in the remediation of contaminated soils (Dirilgen et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 1979). 529 \nCommon soil properties that determine the rate and quantity that material is leached from soils 530 \ninclude the cation exchange capacity (C.E.C.), crop\/ plant cover, soil texture, soil permeability, 531 \nsoil organic matter, soil pH. Leaching is also dependent on climatic factors such as temperature 532 \nand precipitation. Due to the number of controlling factors and the large variability in these 533 \nproperties soils have a resultant highly variable susceptibility to leaching,  534 \nIn addition, soil can act as a source of contaminants through pathways such as the ingestion of 535 \nplant or animal products that have assimilated contaminants from the soil, with humans or 536 \nanimal health as receptors (Collins et al. 2006; Earl and Kearney 2000; Michaud et al. 1991; 537 \nSj\u00f6str\u00f6m et al. 2008). Soil properties which affect the bioavailability of contaminants include soil 538 \npH, soil texture, soil C.E.C., soil organic matter, porosity, bulk density, water content, hydraulic 539 \nconductivity, and soil temperature (Chiou et al. 2001; Hung and Mackay 1997; Massas et al. 540 \n2002; Ryan et al. 1988; Topp et al. 1986; Trapp and Matthies 1995; Travis and Arms 1988). 541 \nPlants can modify the rhizophere by production of organic acids and therefore may exclude or 542 \naccumulate contaminants selectively (Glick 2004).  543 \n \n \nThere is also potential for the ingestion of contaminated soil directly by humans (especially 544 \nchildren) and animals (Beyer and Connor, E. E. Gerould, S. 1994; Calabrese et al. 1997). In this 545 \ncase the soil would be a source and a pathway to the receptor. In this case a physiologically 546 \nbased extraction test (PBET) can relate bioavailability to soil properties such as pH, C.E.C., Fe- 547 \nand Mn-oxide content, particle size distribution, and total organic and inorganic C, water 548 \ncontent, bulk density, porosity (Stewart et al. 2003a; Stewart et al. 2003b; Thompson et al. 549 \n1992). The atmosphere can act as a pathway of contaminants from a soil source where there is 550 \na vapour transfer of contaminants to a receptor of humans, animals or buildings (Cowherd et al. 551 \n1985; Jury et al. 1990; Little et al. 1992).  Soil vapour transfer is influenced by climatic and 552 \nmeteorological factors as well as soil properties of total porosity unsaturated zone, water filled 553 \nporosity unsaturated zone, organic carbon fraction, soil dry bulk density, soil permeability, 554 \nmoisture content, soil texture as well as soil temperature (Evans et al. 2001; Fischer et al. 555 \n1996). Besides vapour transfer of contaminants other soil to atmosphere transfers exist such as 556 \nradon. Radon-222 is a natural radioactive gas that is produced from the decay of radium 557 \n(\n226\nRa), itself produced from the decay of uranium, found naturally in small, but hererogenous, 558 \nquantities in all soils and rock (Appleton 2007).  Exposure to radon indoors is the largest 559 \ncontributor to radiation exposure  and has been linked to lung cancer (Darby et al. 1998; Miles 560 \nand Appleton 2005). Soil gas has been identified as the main source of indoor radon (Nazaroff 561 \nand Sextro 1989). Radon potential is the result of a combination of the properties of the soil, 562 \nand the underlying geology such as the radium concentration and its distribution in the soil, the 563 \nsoil porosity, permeability, moisture content and also meteorological variables (Winkler et al. 564 \n2001).  565 \nSoil, as mentioned above, has the potential to act as a pathway. An example of this is the 566 \ncreation of soil particulate matter by the process of wind erosion (Cave et al. 2009; Macleod et 567 \nal. 2006). The particulate matter can carry contaminants to receptors such as humans or other 568 \norganisms. Soil properties affecting wind erosion include soil erodible fraction, soil crust, soil 569 \nroughness, soil texture, and bulk density, plant factors that can affect wind erosion include 570 \ngrowing crops and flat and standing residues in addition to climatic factors (Fryrear et al. 1998; 571 \nFryrear et al. 2000). Another example is the soil migration, plant uptake and volatilisation of 572 \n \n \nradio-selenium material through from contaminated groundwater, dependent on the soil redox 573 \nstatus (Ashworth and Shaw 2006).  574 \nSoils can also be a receptor, especially when they are perceived as a product, or a media that 575 \nneeds to be protected from pollution. Sources of soil contamination are diverse and can be 576 \ndefined as point source or non point source (Rawlins et al. 2005). Point sources are those 577 \nwhere the source of pollution is clearly identifiable and can be traced back to the specific source 578 \nsuch as leakages from underground storage tanks (Naidu et al. 2006a). Point source pollution is 579 \ntypically associated with acute pollution incidents and the assessment of this falls under the 580 \nremit of traditional contaminated land investigation. With an increase in environmental 581 \nlegislation and environmental awareness since the 1970s and 1980s point source pollution has 582 \ncome under increasingly strict control. There has consequently been an increasing emphasis on 583 \nnon point source pollution. The historic definition of soil quality has related to non-point or 584 \ndiffuse pollution and its effects on the ability of soil to function. The effects of anthropogenic 585 \ncontamination can be assessed through monitoring of soil quality indicators over time.   Non 586 \npoint source pollution of soils is where there is no obvious single point source of discharge and 587 \nthe contamination is widespread in nature (Naidu et al. 2006b). This type of contamination, 588 \nwhen compared to point source contamination, can typically be described as chronic pollution 589 \nand can be associated with a decline in soil quality. Non point contamination sources that have 590 \nthe potential to effect upon soils ability to function can include aerial transport and deposition of 591 \ncontaminants from a number of anthropogenic activities such as transport and heavy industry 592 \n(Facchinelli et al. 2001) fertiliser and pesticide application (Mostaghimi et al. 2001; Torbert et al. 593 \n2002), and use of soil amendments (Voulvoulis and Lester 2006). The susceptibility of soils to 594 \nact as a receptor to contaminants depends not only on the presence of point or diffuse sources 595 \nof pollution and the concentration of contaminants but on a number of soil properties and other 596 \nfactors. Susceptibility of soils to act as a receptor can be defined as the potential of soils to be 597 \neffected by contaminants, this either by limiting build up of contaminants, by buffering 598 \ncontaminants, or degrading them (Glazovskaya 1990; Karlen et al. 2001).   599 \nDiscussion 600 \n \n \nThe range of definitions of soil quality has developed since its initial inception by Alexander 601 \n(Alexander 1971), notably by the inclusion of consideration of the soil function. Since the initial 602 \nactivity however, development has slowed and there have been a number of challenges to the 603 \ndefinition of soil quality. Recent concerns are due to the failure of soil quality assessment to 604 \nintegrate simultaneous soil functions which often require contradictory soil properties and 605 \nmanagement (Letey et al. 2003; Sojka and Upchurch 1999; Sojka et al. 2003).  606 \nSoil quality should not be defined solely by the ability of soils to perform a single function (Sojka 607 \nand Upchurch 1999). It should include the potential to perform the multiple functions that are 608 \ndesired of it, by humans, ecosystems and to be able to successfully provide ecosystem 609 \nservices. It should also encompass that the soil can act as a source or pathway to other 610 \nenvironmental media or soil functions.  611 \nSuch a multiple functional soil quality definition takes into account the growing need for 612 \nassessment of soil quality to incorporate the multiple and possibly conflicting functions of soils 613 \n(Letey et al. 2003). Therefore soil quality assessment should be improved to meet changes in 614 \nattitudes to soil and the environment being more than just a resource.  615 \nSoil quality assessment, taking into account the multiple functions that soil provides, normally 616 \nutilises a selection of indicators specific to the soil functions of interest (Ditzler and Tugel 2002). 617 \nTo that extent, dynamic indicator systems, whether selected using expert opinion or other 618 \nmethods such as principal component analysis, can create a good data set for assessment of 619 \nsoil quality. However even then, such methods cannot effectively compare soil quality between 620 \ndifferent soils of different functions. In addition, they often require indicators which are 621 \nexpensive and difficult or laborious to collect data for. Although there may be conflicting 622 \nfunctions that soil is required to carry out, there is a notion that this does not happen in many 623 \ncircumstances and that simultaneity of soils functions can take place. While soils function may 624 \ndetermine ideal values for soil properties, there is overlap between the soil properties necessary 625 \nfor the assessment of the ability to carry out a specific function and these properties can be 626 \nincluded in a minimum dataset. 627 \n \n \nFollowing a risk based approach such methods could be used initially to rank sites according to 628 \na specified soil function, but could not allow for the identification and prioritisation of areas for 629 \nfurther investigation required for cross functional improvements. To improve such a screening 630 \nstep, cross functional indicators could be developed to enable ranking and prioritisation across 631 \ndifferent soil functions to inform further detailed investigation and risk assessment. The use of 632 \nsoil indicators in soil protection and soil quality assessment in legal frameworks is currently 633 \nlimited across Europe. The European environment agency has mapped soil quality of some 634 \nsouthern European states, using indices based on soil parent material, soil depth, soil texture 635 \nand the slope of the land surface. The indicator system appears to focus on desertification, 636 \nwhere the soil has lost part of its capability to support human communities and ecosystems 637 \n(European Environment Agency 2009).  The UK Environment Agency undertook research into 638 \nsoil quality indicators, and suggested using total above-ground biomass production, total below-639 \nground soil organic carbon, topsoil pH, buffering capacity, keystone species, soil microbial 640 \ndiversity, soil surface condition, extent and depth of ploughing, area of land taken for mineral 641 \nworkings (Loveland and Thompson 2002; Merrington et al. 2006). In a review of this work in 642 \n2006, the minimum data set was revised to soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, Olsen P, 643 \navailable and total copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn), bulk density, and pH. This minimum 644 \ndataset has a bias toward soils chemical factors.   645 \nThe cross functional indicators should collect information on soils chemical, physical and 646 \nbiological properties and the associated factors that determine soils quality. Specific indicators 647 \nused would depend on the method of data collection, sampling strategy, available resources, 648 \ndesired decision making output, and scale of application. Assessment must take place if a 649 \ndesired level of data quality will be met for indicators selected to allow adequate evaluation of 650 \nthe soil quality.  However independent of factors controlling the amount of information collected 651 \nthere is a minimum dataset that will be required for assessment of soil quality. The minimum 652 \ndataset is likely to include pH, soil texture, organic carbon, infiltration rate, root presence, plant 653 \ncover, soil odour, soil organism presence and diversity, soil colour, evidence of anthropogenic 654 \ndisruption (i.e. presence of construction material, coal\/ soot) and penetrability. In addition 655 \nimportant information about landuse and habitat will provide useful information. This information 656 \n \n \nwill likely provide more useful information when investigated spatially and not necessarily at a 657 \nsite specific level. The scale at which these indicators would be applied depends on the spatial 658 \nvariation of soil properties, and research into this should be undertaken in the design stage of 659 \nthe system. Such method should be built upon significant experience of the use of screening 660 \ntools in environmental and other applications.  661 \nDetailed environmental assessment is often informed by the use of screening tools. Screening 662 \ntools are generally designed to gather a large amount of information quickly and at a low cost. 663 \nScreening tools are used extensively in many areas including healthcare, product development, 664 \ninternational development, and environmental quality (Calantone et al. 1999; Department for 665 \nInternational Development (DFID) 2003; Elmore et al. 2005). Screening tools used in the 666 \nenvironment include flood risk (Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG) 667 \n2006), site prioritisation and regulation (Environment Agency 2009), contaminated land 668 \n(Environmental Protection Agency 1996; Pollard et al. 2004), air quality (Department of the 669 \nEnvironment (DoE) 1997) , water quality (Alvarez-Guerra et al. 2009), environmental fate 670 \n(Duarte-Davidson and Jones 1996; Wilson et al. 1996)and chemical risk (Pan et al. 2009). 671 \nSimilarly, the development of a ranking and prioritisation method for soil quality assessment has 672 \nthe potential to help toward implementing current and future soil regulation, for example the soil 673 \nthematic strategy (European Commission (EC) 2006b) and the likely requirements of the SFD 674 \n(European Commission (EC) 2006c; Van-Camp et al. 2004). The development of cross 675 \nfunctional soil indicators could facilitate direct comparison of soils and as such allow 676 \nprioritisation of soils flagged for further attention. Such indicators should be standard for every 677 \nsoil assessed, allowing expert knowledge of the methodologies by personnel carrying out 678 \nmultiple assessments with a resulting decreased level of error. The output of such assessment 679 \nshould still provide all the information incorporated and not just be a single index figure of soil 680 \nquality. It should aim to provide evidence collated into a number of indices; that could be used 681 \nby specialists to inform further decision making.  682 \nThe selection of cross functional soil indicators, development of their indices and methods for 683 \ninterpreting them are all very challenging tasks.  The use of Pedotransfer functions as predictive 684 \n \n \nfunctions of certain soil properties when determining soil quality indicators could support 685 \nefficient assessment of soil quality (Bouma 1989; Jana et al. 2007). For example, soil name, 686 \ntopsoil textural class, land use, and mean temperature are often used to facilitate the estimation 687 \nof the topsoil organic carbon (Daroussin and King 1999). A compiled cross functional soil 688 \nindicator dataset could also be complemented by data from other sources to make estimates of 689 \nother soil properties. Use of soil inference systems can be used to make estimates of 690 \nexpensive, difficult to obtain or unavailable indicators from the less expensive and easier to 691 \nobtain broad soil indicators (McBratney et al. 2002).  692 \nIn addition, previous soil quality assessment methodologies have not assessed soil organisms 693 \nin the same detail as soil physical and chemical properties. The presence and types of soil 694 \norganisms can facilitate cross functional screening indicators and their use has great potential in 695 \nsoil quality assessment and remediation (H\u00e9ry et al. 2008; Singer et al. 2001). Such as 696 \napproach is in accordance with other environmental quality assessments that incorporate 697 \necological risk in their frameworks (Ashton et al. 2008).  698 \nThe system of prioritisation of soils using measurement of cross functional indicators suggested 699 \nin this paper does not aim to replace current methodologies that are required for risk 700 \nassessment.  It is not an alternative to the Triad approach that requires the simultaneous and 701 \nintegrated deployment of chemical, toxicological and ecological lines of evidence for risk 702 \nassessment (Chapman 1986; Rutgers et al. 2001).  On the contrary, the results of this 703 \nscreening step aim to support the weight of evidence approach (Burton et al. 2002; Chapman et 704 \nal. 2002; Interdepartmental Group on Health Risks from Chemicals 2002) by identifying areas of 705 \nconcern, focusing risk assessment investigations to reach a conclusion about an environmental 706 \nsystem or stressor. 707 \nSuch a screening option has also the potential to facilitate long term soil quality monitoring 708 \nprogrammes. Although soil surveys have been carried out, these generally are not repeated in 709 \ntime and therefore qualify as inventories rather than monitoring programs (Department for Food 710 \nand Rural Affairs (DEFRA). 2003). Monitoring programs currently generally rely on repeat visits 711 \nto a number of preselected sites e.g. Countryside Survey (Carey et al. 2008) and the 712 \n \n \nEnvironmental Change Network (Environmental Change Network 2009). Existing monitoring 713 \nand inventory programs, especially those carried out before 1990, have largely omitted urban 714 \nsoils due to the emphasis of the programs use on mineral extraction, wanting to exclude 715 \nanthropogenic pollution (Johnson and Ander 2008). There are also issues with difficulty of 716 \naccessing sites, and the heterogeneity of the urban environment. A prioritisation method that 717 \nrepeats surveys over time has the potential to be used to monitor soils and to provide data for 718 \nareas where lacking from other programs, however will not replace existing monitoring 719 \nprograms. Such methods have the potential to fill in gaps in existing monitoring regimes and 720 \ninform the need for further function specific assessment, potentially providing useful information 721 \nto meet current and future regulations relating to soil and their protection. Methodologies to 722 \nassess the impacts of land management practices and pollution on soil need to be developed, 723 \nwith this leading to practices preventing and managing degradation of soils. Broad cross 724 \nfunctional indicators might be more appropriate for such use.   725 \nSoils do not have a static state and properties can vary significantly both spatially over small 726 \ndistances, and over time. Due to the dynamic state of the system a single measurement in 727 \nspace or time can be problematic in evaluation. There is a need to assess the dynamics of soil 728 \nquality associated with varying soil properties and intrinsic cycles and trends associated with the 729 \nspatial and temporal variability of soil properties and soil quality, which can be evaluated using 730 \nmethods such as control charts (Larson and Peirce 1994). There is a need to relate clearly how 731 \nthe dynamic state of soils influences its ability to function, and ultimately the soil quality. Use of 732 \nsuggested cross functional soil quality indicators could allow repeat measurements can be 733 \naffordably collected. Collection of repeat indicator measurements can allow determination of 734 \nhow spatial and temporal variability of soil properties can influence soil quality. It is with this 735 \nknowledge that it can be adequately determined if soil quality is changing due to natural 736 \nvariation or is in fact subject to decline.  737 \nScreening methodologies could be developed with the potential to act as the basis for collection 738 \nof soil characteristics by non specialists, allowing for even more cost effective, relatively quick, 739 \neasy screening of soil characteristics. Use of a larger group of personnel makes regular 740 \n \n \nrepeated measurements of soils more feasible than solely using experts; however it would 741 \nrequire considerable organisation and commitment from participants to provide more than just 742 \none off data. This could however be accomplished using keen specialist groups.    743 \nIn general, based on the review undertaken in this work, further research is required to develop 744 \nan effective methodology\/ framework for soil quality assessment under emerging regulatory 745 \nrequirements. As discussed, research is needed to better establish the spatial and temporal 746 \nvariation in soil properties this allowing the scale of application of soil quality assessment 747 \nmethods to be determined. There is a clear need to establish the relationship between soil 748 \norganisms, soil properties and soil quality; this has the potential benefit of identifying organisms\/ 749 \nspecies that can be used as holistic bioindicators of soil quality or of more specific threats for 750 \nexample soil contamination. There is an ongoing need to establish linkages between soil 751 \nindicators, effectively allowing further development of pedotransfer functions allowing the most 752 \nresource efficient establishment of soil properties. Development of a method for assessment of 753 \nthe collected information needs to build upon the significant application of environmental risk 754 \nassessment and screening decision making; research will need to draw upon expert knowledge 755 \nof the soil system and interactions between the biological, chemical and physical factors. 756 \nMethodology development will need considerable calibration with existing datasets and field 757 \ntesting in a range of situations from severely degraded sites to those considered pristine. 758 \nAs well as soil regulation, screening and prioritisation of sites could have the ability to fit well 759 \nwith the modern needs of environmental protection and policy, complimenting the recent move 760 \nto a holistic approach to environmental appraisal.  761 \nConclusion 762 \nThere are a number of new and emerging regulations which aim to protect soils and prevent soil 763 \ndegradation. Soil degradation is often seen as closely related to, and effecting, soil quality.  In 764 \norder to protect soils from a decline in soil quality and ultimately from soil degradation it was 765 \nnecessary to improve the understanding of the terms soil and soil quality and to review how soil 766 \nquality is assessed.   767 \n \n \nThis paper has reflected that assessment of soil quality that has integrated soils function has 768 \nnot achieved consensus in the scientific community. Assessment of soil quality with respect to 769 \nits function can rely on expensive and time consuming methods. The use of different indicators 770 \nchosen dependent on the soil function is potentially challenging with regard to comparison of 771 \nquality between soils with different functions. A method to evaluate and prioritise further 772 \ninvestigation and risk assessment could be developed that uses cross functional indicators.  773 \nUse of cross functional indicators could prove a more effective method to assess soils ability to 774 \nmeet the multiple and often conflicting requirements of it. The use of indicators in this way 775 \nshould significantly contribute to the knowledge based approach to soil monitoring and inform 776 \nsoil protection and sustainable use.  777 \nA standardised methodology for the assessment and comparison of many soils with different 778 \nand multiple soil functions requires the development of set of a broad soil indicators. Indicators 779 \nthat are selected for inclusion in a site identification and prioritisation method should be cross-780 \nfunctional, that is applicable to many soil functions. Soil quality indicators currently in use in 781 \nexisting soil quality assessment tools and monitoring programmes should be assessed for their 782 \nability to act as cross-functional indicators and inclusion in Pedotransfer functions.  783 \nThe use of screening methods using broad soil indicators that do not rely upon specific soil 784 \nfunctions has the ability to fit well with the modern needs of monitoring within soil regulation, as 785 \nwell as general environmental protection and policy. It has the potential to provide information to 786 \nassist in compliance with legislation requiring monitoring or identification of geographical 787 \nrisk\/priority areas such as the proposed EU Soil Framework Directive and the EU Soil Thematic 788 \nStrategy. Such methods could highlight areas requiring further attention and threat dependent 789 \nassessment for example detailed identification of areas requiring special protection from 790 \nerosion, organic matter decline, compaction, salinisation, landslides, and acidification, using 791 \nindicators specific to the threat in question. There have been problems reaching agreement on 792 \nthe content of the proposed Soil Framework Directive partly because of the different methods 793 \nused in European member states and the requirement to identify risk\/priority areas requiring 794 \nspecial protection from erosion, organic matter decline, compaction, salinisation, landslides and 795 \n \n \nacidification. A systematic approach to identification of areas of concern could help with this 796 \nrequirement and allow progress to be made on development of the directive. 797 \n \n \nAcknowledgements 798 \nThe authors wish to acknowledge the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 799 \n(EPSRC) for a PhD studentship and the Big Lottery Fund for facilitating collaboration between 800 \nImperial College London, the Environment Agency, British Geological Survey and ERM.   801 \n \n \nTable 1 Definitions of soil in legislation and literature 802 \nSoil Definition Jurisdiction Reference \nThe upper layer of the earth's crust, as far as this \nlayer fulfils the soil functions, and including its liquid \ncomponents (soil solution) and gaseous components \n(soil air), except groundwater and beds of bodies of \nwater \nGermany Federal Ministry for the \nEnvironment Nature \nConservation and Nuclear \nSafety 1998 \nThe solid part of the earth including liquid and \ngaseous compounds and organisms therein \nNetherlands VROM (The Netherlands \nMinistry of Housing, \nPhysical Planning and the \nEnvironment) 1986 \nSoil is the zone where plants take root, the foundation \nfor terrestrial life and the basis for a large amount of \neconomic production and varies in depth from a few \ncentimetres to several meters \nUK Environment Agency 2004 \nSolid part of the earth, including the groundwater and \nthe other components and organisms that are present \nin it \nBelgium \u2013 Flanders Public Waste Agency of \nFlanders (OVAM) 2007 \nSoil is generally defined as the top layer of the earth\u2019s \ncrust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, \nwater, air and living organisms \nEU European Commission \n(EC) 2006b \nThe top layer of the Earth\u2019s crust situated between the \nbedrock and the surface.
