Not because\nof any misguided sentimentality, but simply because the UK\u2019s Research Assessment\nExercise (RAE) seems to have caused us serious problems. Grainne Conole, in her last\neditorial, reflected on some of the lessons learnt from the RAE; one thing that this issue has\ntaught me is that the researchers affected by the exercise either rushed to say all they could\nbefore the deadline or else have worn themselves out with all their writing and don\u2019t want\nto do it any more. It\u2019s fortunate for us that ALT-J is an international journal, rather than\nbeing tied entirely to one nation\u2019s policy initiatives.\nOur peer reviewers do a thankless job \u2013 asked to write considered feedback on papers\nwithout recognition or reward. As editors, we\u2019re truly grateful to them. In the time in which\nI\u2019ve been editing the journal, they\u2019ve consistently driven up the standards of the articles that\nwe have published. We have had an active policy of trying to help authors improve their\nwork \u2013 of providing rich feedback rather than outright rejection. The vast majority of\npublished articles have been resubmitting; none are accepted without any changes. It\u2019s the\nreviewers\u2019 feedback that is the driving force behind this process of improvement.\nGenerally, this policy has served us well. However, this together with the shortage of\nsubmissions from the UK, has resulted in the substantial delays that have plagued this issue.\nWe could not meet the deadline for this issue and preserve the quality of articles that we\nhave aspired to in recent years. In consultation with the Association for Learning Technology\nand our publishers, we agreed that it would be better for this issue to be late than to be poor.\nSo whilst the issue might be late, the articles we have waited to bring together raise\nsome important questions. Lam, McNaught, and Cheng explore the processes of know-\nledge building within the research community. The widespread production of case studies\nin e-learning can be a good way of drawing new researchers into that community, but it can\nbroaden our understanding of issues without deepening it. This paper explores some ways\nin which that depth can be discovered by making connections across case research.\nAnother taken-for-granted issue in much research in this area is the contrast between on-\ncampus and distance students. There is certainly evidence to demonstrate the different\nexperiences these groups have. However, Woo et al. show how changing social practices\nand use of new technologies can disrupt such differences, so that students begin thinking\ndifferently about how they participate in campus-based activities. Staff were also prompted\nto rethink assumptions about distance students as receiving a \u2018second best\u2019 experience.\nThings are much more complicated than our convenient binaries suggest, and it is helpful\nto be reminded of this.\nWe have two articles in this issue that revisit the perennial issue of change within\nHigher Education Institutions. Salmon, Jones, and Armellini describe the action research\nwork that has led to a participative workshop format for academic development being form-\nalised and shared across the sector. Ooms et al. explore the role of e-developers, and report\nthat things that might often be overlooked \u2013 specifically, their personalities, and their role\n60  Editorial\nin sustaining communication \u2013 are important to the success of the projects with which they\nwork. Importantly, both articles strive to make academic development more meaningful by\norganising their initiatives around the problems academics face in their work (rather than\nthrough decontextualised programmes of workshops, say). Student-centred learning is an\nextremely popular idea, but perplexingly, the notion that we should treat our colleagues in\nthe same way when they are learning things often seems to be overlooked, so these\nexamples of practice are helpful in redressing that balance.\nFinally, Gakhal and Bull describe a case study of an intelligent tutoring system that\npromises to illuminate aspects of another popular term: personalisation. Such systems were\nalways predicated on the idea that instruction and support should be tailored to the needs of\nindividual learners; systems supporting personalisation have been around for decades.\nHowever, this one incorporates an open learner model, providing users with a degree of\ncontrol over the ways in which information is managed and presented.\nBetween them, these articles offer a view of the field that is complex, messy and\ngrounded in social practices. Personally, I think that\u2019s a good note on which to end my\ninvolvement as editor.\nSo, where does all this leave ALT-J? We are lucky to have Frances Bell and Rhona\nSharpe taking over as editors. They will bring new ideas and new energy to the journal. For\nall their wisdom and expertise, though, they will face some difficult challenges. It falls to\nall of us who read the journal to help them \u2013 by writing, and encouraging others to write.\nWhether it\u2019s a colleague describing something interesting they\u2019ve tried out, or a project\npresentation, or a coffee conversation that got you thinking, consider suggesting to people\nthat they try and turn it into an article. Journals are, after all, about conversations within\ncommunities \u2013 if we keep talking, perhaps we can even overcome the problems that initia-\ntives such as the RAE cause.\nMartin Oliver\nInstitute of Education, London, UK\n"}
