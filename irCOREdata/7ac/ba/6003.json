There were many\nconsiderations too complex to address in the paper and we accept the danger of\noversimplification. Our summary of the RESULTs Network development was\neffectively a first attempt to match human values and behaviours to technical systems.\nGunn suggests that a key element missing from our scenario is in having \u2018a compelling\nreason for users to access the resources and participate in the communities provided\u2019.\nThe factors at play in terms of \u2018motivation to participate\u2019 were extensively researched\nin the user participation study. A full reading is available in Beetham (2001). Never-\ntheless, there remains an important question about the process of adoption and\nparticipation. I would like therefore to take up the challenge of considering further the\nidea that communities of practice must \u2018evolve\u2019 and cannot be \u2018created\u2019.\nFirstly, the issue of access to technology for educational use was raised, and in partic-\nular the need for operational capability as well as physical capability. One assumes that,\nfor a facility designed for resource exchange and support for users of learning technologies\n(from whence the acronym RESULTs arose), most practitioners in this field would\nbe expected to be familiar with a web environment. I would agree, however, that a\nlack of competent interaction is a highly significant factor in the early adoption and\nparticipation of RESULTs. There may well be huge variation in the levels of\nconfidence and ability of potential users, not in terms of operating the technology\nitself but in negotiating the various modes of interaction with resources and with other\n*Centre for Academic Practice, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.

While the functionality was put forward by a wide range\nof potential end-users\u2014and the authors represented four different \u2018types\u2019 of learning\ntechnologist\u2014the technical manifestation of that functionality may appear over-\nwhelming to even the most competent web users. We attempted to build in highly\ninnovative features, resulting in a high level of technical wizardry (although I would\nargue that this was based on a set of quite unique portal concepts) at the cost of a\nweak level of participation. For this reason, I agree that a successful participation\nprocess is likely to be much more one of evolution than one of creation. The environ-\nment for a community of practice was created, but the community would need to\nevolve to take advantage of it.\nSecondly I will consider semantic capability, that is, the ability of the portal system\nto accommodate the differences in language and practice inevitable in a community\nof practice as wide and with such varied expertise as \u2018users of learning technologies\u2019.\nThere is a wide range of issues involved in how users can exchange and integrate both\ninformation and resources between databases, given that each may have its own\nstructure or taxonomy. We have tackled this issue separately in a recently submitted\npaper (Richardson et al., submitted), which clarifies the issues concerning interoper-\nability of data systems and user-defined taxonomies and also provides suggestions for\nnew technical approaches. \nAccepting that the process of people using such a portal is one of evolution rather\nthan creation, the rate of such evolution might depend on two key elements: firstly,\nthe orientation to one\u2019s own development (see Land, 2000) and, secondly, the luxury\nof time (which funded projects rarely have) for diffusion models of innovation (e.g.\nHavelock\u2019s stepping stones approach; 1973). Both point towards the need to build in\n\u2018a kind of accumulative osmosis via good contacts and personal contact, identifying\nchampions or nurturing champions, bring others along\u2019. Some transitional processes\nmay have helped deal with the complexities of expert and non-expert levels of compe-\ntence with portal environments, coupled with a scaffolding model of support for\nadding new users as part of the evaluation process. A national champion or home\nmight have made facilitation of the process a longer-lived venture. I would question\nthe extent to which induction, orientation and other such comfort-giving interaction\nby the project team might have assisted this journey for potential participators. Berg\nand \u00d6stergren (1979), for example, advocate that \u2018innovations cannot be inserted\nfrom outside: they have to be created anew within the system, by those who are\nmembers of it.\" \nThe debate around our paper serves the learning technology community well in\nthat attention is given to the role of learning technologists (in the broadest sense) as\nimportant drivers in the development process. RESULTs built a learning technology\nportal to a well-researched, targeted and tested user specification. Response to\nfunctionality was very positive. But users came to the RESULTs Network much more\nas consumers (wanting access to resources) than contributors (wanting to participate\nin a community of practice). In this way, the learning technology community acted\nin much the same ways as academic staff do in relation to embedding change\n(Oliver & Dempster, 2003). Certainly, the importance and evolving experience of the\n Creeting virtual communities of practice for learning technology in higher education:\n \n101\n                    \u2018inter-relationship between expert and non-expert users and learning technology\u2019 is\nan area worthy of further study.\nPerhaps the learning technology community has not yet reached the point we had\npredicted in our proposal for this project. This indicated a gap in both relevant and\nvalued resources and in opportunities to share practice and materials. In conclusion,\nwe would agree with Gunn, recognising that you can create a \u2018watering hole\u2019 and\npossibly bring your \u2018horses\u2019 to it, but you cannot necessarily make them \u2018drink\u2019.\nAt least not until they get very thirsty! (Is that a form of evolution or just a bad\nmetaphor?) The point is summed up eloquently by Machiavelli: \nIt must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of\nsuccess, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new system. For the initiator\nhas the enmity of all who would profit by the preservation of the old institution and merely\nlukewarm defenders in those who should gain by the new ones.\nReferences\nBeetham, H.
