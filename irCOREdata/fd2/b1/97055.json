K. Maini et al.\n1. Introduction\nReaction-diffusion equations of the form\nv\u03c4 = (\u03a6(v))xx + f(v), x \u2208 R, \u03c4 \u2265 0 (1.1)\nwith \u03a6(0) = 0,\u03a6 monotone increasing, have been widely used in the literature (see,\nfor instance, Ref. 12 and the references therein) in order to describe the spatial\ndispersion of a population. In (1.1) v(x, \u03c4) denotes the population density at time\n\u03c4 and location x; the reaction term f(v) accounts for the rate at which individuals\nenter the population due to births and deaths, while the diffusion term \u03a6(v) repre-\nsents the dispersal of the population. In writing (1.1) it is assumed that births and\ndeaths do not depend on time and location.\nEquation (1.1) with \u03a6 increasing cannot model frequently observed phenomena\nsuch as swarming or local grouping of individuals since it describes the case in which\nall the individuals migrate toward regions of lower density.\nSeveral authors have recently proposed various mathematical models aimed at\ndescribing the phenomenon of aggregation of populations.3,7,13,15 In most cases the\nfunction \u03a6 is assumed to be monotone increasing in (0, \u03b2) and monotone decreasing\nin (\u03b2, 1), \u03b2 being a suitable critical value of the density v. In this way the term \u03a6\ntakes into account both the dispersal of individuals due to random motion and the\ntendency of the population to crowd. When the density is small, dispersal prevails,\nwhile for population densities beyond the critical value \u03b2 the tendency to aggregate\nbecomes predominant. This paper is devoted to the investigation of Eq. (1.1) under\nthis condition of aggregation-diffusion on the term \u03a6.\nParticular cases of (1.1) have been derived and partially analyzed in Refs. 7, 9,\n13 and 15, but several open problems remain. Indeed, the initial-boundary value\nproblem associated with (1.1) can be ill-posed1,2; however, in Ref. 13 existence and\nuniqueness of a global solution are shown for the perturbed equation, obtained\nfrom (1.1) by adding a regularizing term (\u03bbvt \u2212 \u03bbf(v))xx with \u03bb > 0. It is worth\nremarking that the discrete model underlying (1.1) is well-posed,7,15 and numerical\ncomputations show a good agreement between the information obtained in the dis-\ncrete setting and the predictions derived from (1.1). We refer the reader interested\nin the problem of well-posedness of (1.1) to the discussion presented in Ref. 9 and\nto the references therein.\nExistence and properties of traveling wave solutions (denoted t.w.s. from now\non) between the stationary states 0 and 1, for Eq. (1.1) with an aggregation-diffusion\nterm \u03a6 and a Fisher\u2013KPP (monostable) reaction term f , i.e. satisfying f(v) > 0 in\n(0, 1), f(0) = f(1) = 0, have been analyzed by the authors in Ref. 9. T.w.s. play a\nrelevant role in the study of reaction-diffusion equations, since in some cases4,8 they\nattract solutions whose initial datum is not too far from the wave profile. In our\ncontext of possible ill-posedness of the initial value problem for Eq. (1.1), t.w.s. are\nregular solutions whose profile seems in good agreement with the numerical inves-\ntigations done in Ref. 13 for the perturbed dynamic. The existence of a threshold\nvalue c\u2217 was proved in Ref. 9 such that (1.1) supports t.w.s. with speed c if and\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\nAggregative Movement and Front Propagation for Bi-Stable Population Models 1353\nFig. 1. Possible t.w.s. solutions for Eq. (1.1) with critical wavespeed (see text for details).\nonly if c \u2265 c\u2217. The properties of such fronts have also been investigated. Indeed, the\npossible degeneracy of the diffusion-aggregation term (occurring when \u03a6\u02d9(0) = 0\nand\/or \u03a6\u02d9(1) = 0) causes the appearance of fronts which attain the equilibria 0\nand\/or 1 at finite times. When c > c\u2217 the dynamics admit only classical (i.e. front-\ntype) t.w.s., instead, for c = c\u2217 one of the four possible types of t.w.s. illustrated\nin Fig. 1 appears and we refer to the following section for their definition.\nWe underline that reaching the equilibrium 1 at a finite time is typical of\ndiffusion-aggregation processes, since this does not occur in the case of reaction-\ndiffusion equations (with positive diffusion), even if \u03a6\u02d9(1) = 0.10 Dynamics exhibit-\ning such phenomena are generally said to have the properties of finite speed of\nsaturation (when the t.w.s. attains the equilibrium 1 at a finite time), and\/or finite\nspeed of propagation (when the t.w.s. reaches the equilibrium 0 at a finite time). In\nthe context of merely diffusive processes, Gilding and Kersner5 proved that when\na right-compact profile appears (i.e. a t.w.s. of sharp type (I) or (III), see Fig. 1),\nthen all the solutions v(x, \u03c4) of (1.1), with initial condition v(x, 0) having compact\nsupport, maintain a uniformly bounded support for all \u03c4 in a right neighborhood of\n0. In other words, a population initially localized in an arbitrarily bounded region\ndiffuses in the habitat with finite speed. Due to this property, degenerate reaction-\ndiffusion equations are appropriate models for biological diffusion. It is open to\nquestion whether the appearance of right-compact supported t.w.s. induces the\nsame property in aggregation processes (1.1).\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\n1354 P. K. Maini et al.\nThe aim of this paper is to analyze front propagation when the reproduction rate\nsatisfies the Allee effect,13 that is when there is a critical value \u03b1 of the population\ndensity such that below it the death rate is higher than the birth rate, while above\nit the opposite situation occurs. Formally, this means that f is a bi-stable reaction\nterm satisfying\nf(0) = f(\u03b1) = f(1) = 0, f(v) < 0 in (0, \u03b1), f(v) > 0 in (\u03b1, 1) (1.2)\nfor some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). Jointly with Ref. 9, this investigation begins with a theory\non the existence of t.w.s. and illustrates their properties in diffusion-aggregation\nprocesses. What is relevant in the present case (i.e. when f(u) satisfies (1.2)), is\nthat the existence of wavefront connections between the stationary states 0 and 1\nis no longer guaranteed, but depends on the relative behavior of \u03b1 and \u03b2. Indeed\n(see Theorem 2.1), necessary conditions for the existence of t.w.s. are\n\u03b1 < \u03b2 and\n\u222b \u03b2\n0\nf(u)\u03a6\u02d9(u)du > 0.\nMoreover, such conditions are not sufficient since the existence of t.w.s. connecting\n1 to 0 is also linked, in some sense, to the existence of heteroclinics connecting 1 to\n\u03b2 and \u03b2 to 1. This is shown in Theorem 3.1, where we also prove that the admissible\nwave speed is unique and we give a criterion to classify the resulting t.w.s. into one\nof the four types described above.\nAs is natural, the necessary and sufficient condition stated in Theorem 3.1 has\nan implicit form, since it involves the wave speeds between 0 and \u03b2 and between\n\u03b2 and 1. So, in Theorem 3.2 we give some simple explicit conditions ensuring the\nvalidity or not of the necessary and sufficient condition of Theorem 3.1, and then\nthe existence or non-existence of t.w.s. An example completes the discussion.\nThe main tools used for our investigation are based on upper\u2013lower solutions\nand comparison techniques in the phase plane. Indeed, due to the mild regularity\nassumptions on the coefficients, the usual methods from dynamical systems theory\ncannot be applied in this context.\n2. Preliminaries and Necessary Conditions\nAs usual, a t.w.s. for Eq. (1.1) is a solution having the form v(\u03c4, x) = u(x\u2212 c\u03c4) for\nsome constant c. The wave profile u is a solution of the equation\n(D(u)u\u2032)\u2032 + cu\u2032 + f(u) = 0, 0 \u2264 u \u2264 1 (E)\nwhere (\u2032) stands for derivation with respect to the wave coordinate t = x \u2212 c\u03c4 ,\nD(u) := \u03a6\u02d9(u) \u2208 C1([0, 1]). As illustrated in the Introduction, our study concerns\ndynamics for which D(u) satisfies\n(u\u2212 \u03b2)D(u) < 0 in (0, 1)\\{\u03b2} (2.1)\nfor some given \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1), and f \u2208 C[0, 1] satisfies (1.2) with \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\nAggregative Movement and Front Propagation for Bi-Stable Population Models 1355\nA function u is a solution of (E) in its maximal existence interval I = (a, b) \u2286 R\nif 0 \u2264 u(t) \u2264 1 in I, u \u2208 C1(I), D(u)u\u2032 \u2208 C1(I), and u satisfies (E) in I. We are\ninterested in the existence of solutions of (E) satisfying the boundary conditions\nu(a+) = 1, u(b\u2212) = 0 (2.2)\nlim\nt\u2192a+\nD(u(t))u\u2032(t) = lim\nt\u2192b\u2212\nD(u(t))u\u2032(t) = 0. (2.3)\nWe start our investigation by analyzing the properties of the possible solutions\nu of Eq. (E) satisfying (2.2) and (2.3).\nProposition 2.1. Let u be a solution of (E) satisfying (2.2). Then\na = \u2212\u221e implies lim\nt\u2192\u2212\u221eD(u(t))u\n\u2032(t) = 0,\nb = +\u221e implies lim\nt\u2192+\u221eD(u(t))u\n\u2032(t) = 0.\nProof. Assume, for instance, a = \u2212\u221e. Let T1 := sup{t : u(\u03c4) > M = max{\u03b1, \u03b2}\nfor every \u03c4 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, t)} and define the functions\nG(u) :=\n\u222b u\nM\nD(s)f(s) ds, \u03a3(t) :=\n1\n2\n[\nD(u(t))u\u2032(t)\n]2\n+ G(u(t)),\nfor u \u2208 (M, 1), t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, T1). Since u satisfies (E), it follows that\nd\ndt\n\u03a3(t) = \u2212cD(u(t))(u\u2032(t))2,\nwhich has the same sign as c, when c \u0006= 0, since u(t) > M in (\u2212\u221e, T1) and then\nD(u(t)) < 0. Hence \u03a3(t) is monotone for t < T1 and limt\u2192\u2212\u221e\u03a3(u(t)) exists, being\neither finite or infinite. Since\nlim\nt\u2192\u2212\u221eG(u(t)) =\n\u222b 1\nM\nD(s)f(s) ds \u2208 R,\nthe existence of limt\u2192\u2212\u221eD(u(t))|u\u2032(t)| =: \u0005 \u2208 [\u2212\u221e, 0] follows. If \u0005 < 0, tak-\ning into account that u(\u2212\u221e) = 1, D(1) \u2264 0, we obtain the existence of\nlimt\u2192\u2212\u221e |u\u2032(t)| =: \u00051 > 0 (possibly \u00051 = +\u221e) which is impossible since u is\nbounded. Therefore \u0005 = 0 and the statement follows.\nThe case b = +\u221e can be treated by means of an analogous argument.\nIn view of the previous proposition, if u is a solution of (E) and (2.2) such that\na = \u2212\u221e (b = +\u221e), then the corresponding condition in (2.3) is automatically\nsatisfied. On the other hand, if u is a solution of (E) satisfying (2.2)\u2013(2.3) and\nsuch that a > \u2212\u221e [b < +\u221e], then limt\u2192a+ u\u2032(t) \u0006= 0 [limt\u2192b\u2212 u\u2032(t) \u0006= 0]. Indeed, if\nu\u2032(a+) = 0 [u\u2032(b\u2212) = 0], then the function which is equal to u in I and identically 1\nin (\u2212\u221e, a] [identically 0 in [b,+\u221e)] is still a solution of (E), in contradiction with\nthe definition of I as maximal existence interval.\nIf I = R the solution u is called a front-type solution, or classical solution. Notice\nthat, as an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.1, the present definition reduces\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\n1356 P. K. Maini et al.\nto the usual one,10,14 since in this case both the conditions in (2.3) are implied by (E)\nand (2.2). However, in our present general setting, due to the possible degeneracy\nof Eq. (E) at the equilibria (when D(0) = 0 and\/or D(1) = 0), other types of\nsolutions can appear, attaining the equilibria at finite values with negative (possibly\ninfinite) slope; we will call them sharp solutions, distinguishing three different types\ndepending on the existence interval. If I = (\u2212\u221e, b), the solution u is called sharp of\ntype (I) and it is right compactly supported. If I = (a,\u221e), the solution u is called\nsharp of type (II) and it is left compactly supported. If I = (a, b) the solution u is\ncalled sharp of type (III) and it is compactly supported (see Fig. 1). Throughout\nthe paper (a, b) will always denote the maximal existence interval of a solution u(t)\nof Eq. (E).\nThe following result provides necessary conditions for the solvability of problem\n(E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3).\nTheorem 2.1. If Eq. (E) admits solutions satisfying conditions (2.2)\u2013(2.3), then\n\u03b1 < \u03b2, c > 0,\n\u222b \u03b2\n0\nf(u)D(u) du > 0. (2.4)\nMoreover, if u(t) is a solution, then u\u2032(t) < 0 whenever 0 < u(t) < 1.\nProof. The proof will proceed by steps. Let\nT1 := sup{t \u2208 (a, b) : u(\u03c4) > max{\u03b1, \u03b2} for every \u03c4 \u2208 (a, t)},\nT2 := inf{t \u2208 (a, b) : u(\u03c4) < min{\u03b1, \u03b2} for every \u03c4 \u2208 (t, b)},\n\u03c41 := inf{t \u2208 (a, T1) : u(\u03c4) < 1 for every \u03c4 \u2208 (t, T1]},\n\u03c42 := sup{t \u2208 (T2, b) : u(\u03c4) > 0 for every \u03c4 \u2208 [T2, t)}.\nOf course, u(T1) = max{\u03b1, \u03b2}, u(\u03c4+1 ) = 1, u(T2) = min{\u03b1, \u03b2}, u(\u03c4\u22122 ) = 0,\nu\u2032(T1) \u2264 0, u\u2032(T2) \u2264 0.\nStep 1. If u is a solution of (E) satisfying (2.2)\u2013(2.3), then\n(i) u\u2032(t) < 0 in (\u03c41, T1) \u222a (T2, \u03c42);\n(ii) if \u03c41 > a then a = \u2212\u221e and u(t) \u2261 1 in (\u2212\u221e, \u03c41);\n(iii) if \u03c42 < b then b = +\u221e and u(t) \u2261 0 in (\u03c42,+\u221e).\nFirst let us prove that u\u2032(t) \u2264 0 whenever t \u2208 (a, T1) \u222a (T2, b). To this aim,\nassume by contradiction that u\u2032(t\u2217) > 0 for some t\u2217 \u2208 (T2, b). Since u(b\u2212) = 0,\nwe deduce the existence of a value t0 > t\u2217 such that u\u2032(t0) = 0 and u\u2032(t) > 0 in\n(t\u2217, t0). Of course, we have 0 < u(t0) < \u03b1, so put h(t) := D(u(t))u\u2032(t). By (E) we\nhave h\u2032(t0) = \u2212f(u(t0)) > 0, i.e. h(t) is increasing in a neighborhood of t0, with\nh(t0) = 0. Since D(u(t0)) > 0 we have that u\u2032(t) < 0 in a left neighborhood of t0,\nin contradiction with the definition of t0, so u\u2032(t) \u2264 0 for every t \u2208 (T2, b).\nLet us now assume, again by contradiction, that u\u2032(\u03c4\u2217) > 0 for some \u03c4\u2217 \u2208\n(a, T1). Put \u03c40 := sup{t : u\u2032(\u03c4) > 0 for every \u03c4 \u2208 (\u03c4\u2217, t)}. Of course, \u03c40 < T1 and\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\nAggregative Movement and Front Propagation for Bi-Stable Population Models 1357\nu\u2032(\u03c40) = 0. Note that u(\u03c40) < 1. Indeed if u(\u03c40) = 1, then integrating (E) in (t, \u03c40)\nand taking into account that f(u) > 0 for u \u2208 (\u03b1, 1), we obtain that there exists\nthe limit limt\u2192a+ D(u(t))u\u2032(t) =\n\u222b \u03c40\na\nf(u(t)) dt > 0, in contradiction with condition\n(2.3). So, \u03b2 < u(\u03c40) < 1 and then h\u2032(\u03c40) = \u2212f(u(\u03c40)) < 0, i.e. h(t) is decreasing\nin a neighborhood of \u03c40, with h(\u03c40) = 0. Since D(u(\u03c40)) < 0, this means that\nu\u2032(t) < 0 in a left neighborhood of \u03c40, in contradiction with the definition of \u03c40.\nHence, u\u2032(t) \u2264 0 for every t \u2208 (a, T1).\nBy the same argument used above, it is easy to prove that if u\u2032(t0) = 0 for\nsome t0 \u2208 (\u03c41, T1) \u222a (T2, \u03c42), then u\u2032(t) > 0 in a right neighborhood of t0, in\ncontradiction with what was proved above, and (i) follows. Now, if a < \u03c41, since\nu(a+) = u(\u03c41) = 1, u\u2032(t) \u2264 0 in (a, \u03c41), then necessarily u\u2032 \u2261 0, u \u2261 1 in (a, \u03c41) and\na = \u2212\u221e, since I = (a, b) the maximal existence interval of the solution. The case\n\u03c42 < b is analogous.\nStep 2. If problem (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3) is solvable, then \u03b1 < \u03b2.\nLet us assume \u03b1 = \u03b2. Since u\u2032(t) < 0 in (\u03c41, T1) \u222a (T2, \u03c42), there exists the\ninverse functions t1 = t1(u) : (\u03b1, 1) \t\u2192 (\u03c41, T1), t2 = t2(u) : (0, \u03b1) \t\u2192 (T2, \u03c42). Let\nz1(u) := D(u)u\u2032(t1(u)), u \u2208 (\u03b1, 1) and z2(u) := D(u)u\u2032(t2(u)), u \u2208 (0, \u03b1). Clearly\nz1(u) > 0 in (\u03b1, 1), z1(\u03b1+) = 0 since D(\u03b1) = 0, z1(1\u2212) = 0 by (2.3) if \u03c41 = a or\nby Step 1 if \u03c41 > a. Similarly, z2(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b1), z2(\u03b1\u2212) = 0 since D(\u03b1) = 0,\nz2(0+) = 0 by (2.3) if \u03c42 = b or by Step 1 if \u03c42 < b. Further, both z1 and z2 satisfy\nthe equation\nz\u02d9(u) = \u2212c\u2212 f(u)D(u)\nz(u)\n(2.5)\nin (\u03b1, 1) and (0, \u03b1) respectively. Multiplying by z(u) and integrating the equality\nzj z\u02d9j = \u2212czj \u2212 f(u)D(u), in (\u03b1, 1) if j = 1, and in (0, \u03b1) if j = 2, we obtain\nc =\n\u2212 \u222b \u03b1\n0\nf(u)D(u) du\u222b \u03b1\n0 z2(u) du\n=\n\u2212 \u222b 1\n\u03b1\nf(u)D(u) du\u222b 1\n\u03b1 z1(u) du\n.\nSince f(u)D(u) < 0 and z1(u) > 0 in (\u03b1, 1) while f(u)D(u) < 0 and z2(u) < 0 in\n(0, \u03b1), we obtain a contradiction.\nAssume now, again by contradiction, \u03b1 > \u03b2. By means of the same argument\nas previously, consider the inverse functions t1 = t1(u) : (\u03b1, 1) \t\u2192 (\u03c41, T1), t2 =\nt2(u) : (0, \u03b2) \t\u2192 (T2, \u03c42), and the functions z1(u) = D(u)u\u2032(t1(u)), u \u2208 (\u03b1, 1) and\nz2(u) = D(u)u\u2032(t2(u)), u \u2208 (0, \u03b2). Since z2 satisfies (2.5) in its existence interval,\nintegrating the relation z2(u)z\u02d92(u) = \u2212cz2(u)\u2212 f(u)D(u) in (0, \u03b2) we obtain\nc =\n\u2212 \u222b \u03b2\n0\nf(u)D(u) du\u222b \u03b2\n0 z2(u) du\n< 0\ntaking into account that f(u)D(u) < 0, z2(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b2). Further, z1(u) > 0 in\n(\u03b1, 1) and from (2.5), z\u02d91(u) > \u2212c > 0 in (\u03b1, 1), in contradiction with the boundary\nvalue z1(1\u2212) = 0.\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\n1358 P. K. Maini et al.\nStep 3. If problem (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3) is solvable, then c > 0.\nWith the same argument as above consider the inverse function t1 = t1(u) :\n(\u03b2, 1) \t\u2192 (\u03c41, T1), and z1(u) = D(u)u\u2032(t1(u)), u \u2208 (\u03b2, 1). Since z1(u) > 0 in (\u03b2, 1), it\nsatisfies (2.5) in this interval, and z1(\u03b2+) = z1(1\u2212) = 0, so integrating the relation\nz\u02d91(u)z1(u) = \u2212cz1(u)\u2212 f(u)D(u) on (\u03b2, 1), we obtain\nc =\n\u2212 \u222b 1\u03b2 f(u)D(u) du\u222b 1\n\u03b2 z1(u) du\n> 0.\nStep 4. If u is a solution of problem (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3), then u\u2032(t) < 0 for every\nt \u2208 (\u03c41, \u03c42).\nLet us consider the function z2(u) = D(u)u\u2032(t2(u)), u \u2208 (0, \u03b1) defined in\nStep 2. We have z2(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b1) and z2(0+) = 0. Moreover, by (2.5) we\nhave z\u02d92(u) < \u2212c < 0 in (0, \u03b1) and so z2(\u03b1\u2212) < 0. Since D(\u03b1) > 0, this implies\nu\u2032(T2) < 0. Moreover, since u(T1) = \u03b2 and D(\u03b2) = 0, we immediately get\nh\u2032(T1) = D\u02d9(\u03b2)[u\u2032(T1)]2, where h was defined in Step 1, and from (E) it follows that\nD\u02d9(\u03b2)[u\u2032(T1)]2 + cu\u2032(T1) + f(\u03b2) = 0. Hence, since f(\u03b2) \u0006= 0 and u\u2032(T1) \u2264 0, we get\nu\u2032(T1) < 0. Note that the same argument shows that u\u2032(t) \u0006= 0 whenever u(t) = \u03b2.\nAssume now, by contradiction, that J0 := {t \u2208 (T1, T2) : u\u2032(t) = 0} \u0006= \u2205. Let\ns1 = min J0, s2 = maxJ0. Notice that if t0 \u2208 J0 with u(t0) \u2208 (0, \u03b1) \u222a (\u03b2, 1), then\nit is a proper local minimum for u, while if u(t0) \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2) then it is a proper local\nmaximum for u. Further, u\u2032(s) \u0006= 0 for every s such that u(s) = \u03b2. Therefore\nu(s1) \u2208 [0, \u03b1], while u(s2) \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2) or u(s2) = 1. So, in particular, s1 \u0006= s2.\nLet us now show that u(s2) \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2). To this aim, assume by contradiction that\nu(s2) = 1. Since in (\u03b2, 1) there can only be minima for u(t), there exists an interval\n(s3, \u03c33) \u2286 (s1, s2) such that u(s3) = \u03b2, u(\u03c33) = 1, u\u2032(t) > 0 in (s3, \u03c33). Let us\nconsider the inverse function t3(u) : (\u03b2, 1) \t\u2192 (s3, \u03c33) and let \u03b63(u) := D(u)u\u2032(t3(u))\nfor u \u2208 (\u03b2, 1).\nWe have that \u03b63 is a solution in (\u03b2, 1) of Eq. (2.5), with \u03b63(\u03b2) = 0 since D(\u03b2) = 0,\nand \u03b63(1\u2212) = 0 since u\u2032(\u03c33) = 0. So, integrating the equation \u03b6\u02d93\u03b63 = \u2212c \u03b63 \u2212\nf(u)D(u) in (\u03b2, 1) we obtain\nc =\n\u2212 \u222b 1\u03b2 f(u)D(u)du\u222b 1\n\u03b2\n\u03b63(u)du\n.\nSince \u03b63(u) and f(u)D(u) are both negative in (\u03b2, 1), this implies c < 0 in contra-\ndiction to Step 3; therefore u(s2) \u2208 (\u03b1, \u03b2).\nSince u\u2032(t) < 0 in (T1, s1) and in (s2, \u03c42), then there exist the inverse func-\ntions t1(u) : (u(s1), \u03b2) \t\u2192 (T1, s1) and t2(u) : (0, u(s2)) \t\u2192 (s2, \u03c42). Let z1(u) =\nD(u)u\u2032(t1(u)) for u \u2208 (u(s1), \u03b2), and z2(u) = D(u)u\u2032(t2(u)), for u \u2208 (0, u(s2)).\nThen both z1 and z2 are negative and satisfy (2.5) in their existence interval. Since\nu\u2032(s1) = u\u2032(s2) = 0, then z1(u(s1)+) = 0 = z2(u(s2)\u2212); further z1(\u03b2\u2212) = 0 since\nD(\u03b2) = 0, and z2(0+) = 0 since if \u03c42 < b we have u\u2032(\u03c42) = 0, while if \u03c42 = b it\nfollows from (2.3).\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\nAggregative Movement and Front Propagation for Bi-Stable Population Models 1359\nIf u(s1) > 0, a point u\u00af \u2208 (u(s1), u(s2)) \u2282 (0, \u03b2) should exist such that z1(u\u00af) =\nz2(u\u00af) < 0, but this is impossible, since (2.5) has the uniqueness property for Cauchy\nproblems with initial data different from zero.\nIf u(s1) = 0, then z1 and z2 should be two negative solutions of Eq. (2.5) in\ntheir existence intervals, (0, \u03b2) and (0, u(s2)) respectively, with 0 = z2(u(s2)\u2212) >\nz1(u(s2)). So, again by the above-mentioned uniqueness property for Eq. (2.5), we\ndeduce that z1(u) < z2(u) for every u \u2208 (0, u(s2)).\nPut \u03b6(u) := z1(u) \u2212 z2(u), u \u2208 (0, \u03b1], we have \u03b6(0+) = 0 (since z1(0+) =\nz2(0+) = 0), \u03b6(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b1] and \u03b6\u02d9(u) = \u03b6(u)f(u)D(u)\/(z1(u)z2(u)).\nLet F (u) := exp\n(\u222b \u03b1\nu\nf(v)D(v)\nz1(v)z2(v)\ndv\n)\n, u \u2208 (0, \u03b1]. Since f(u)D(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b1),\nthere exists F (0+) \u2208 [0, 1). Moreover ddu\u03b6(u)F (u) = 0, hence \u03b6(u)F (u) \u2261 0 in (0, \u03b1].\nAs F (u) > 0, this implies \u03b6(u) \u2261 0 in (0, \u03b1], a contradiction, and this concludes the\nproof of Step 4.\nStep 5. If problem (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3) is solvable, then\u222b \u03b2\n0\nf(u)D(u) du > 0.\nSince u\u2032(t) < 0 in (\u03c41, \u03c42), we can consider the inverse function t(u) : (0, 1) \t\u2192 (\u03c41, \u03c42)\nand z(u) = D(u)u\u2032(t(u)). Of course, z \u2208 C1(0, 1), z(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b2) and z satisfies\n(2.5) in this interval. Further, z(0+) = D(0)u\u2032(\u03c42) = 0 if \u03c42 < b, while if \u03c42 = b then\nz(0+) = 0 by (2.3).

Again we divide the proof into several steps.\nStep 1. There is a bijection between the set of solutions of problem (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3),\nmodulo translation of the origin, and the functions z \u2208 C1(0, 1), satisfying (2.5) in\n(0, \u03b2)\u222a(\u03b2, 1), and such that z(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b2), z(u) > 0 in (\u03b2, 1), z(0+) = z(1\u2212) = 0.\nIn Step 5 of Theorem 2.1, we proved that if u is a solution of problem (E), (2.2)\u2013\n(2.3), then the function z(u) = D(u)u\u2032(t(u)) (where t(u) is the inverse function of\nu(t), t \u2208 (\u03c41, \u03c42)) is in C1(0, 1), and satisfies (2.5) in (0, \u03b2). Moreover z(u) < 0 in\nthis interval, and z(0+) = 0. One can immediately check that z(u) satisfies (2.5)\nalso in (\u03b2, 1), z(u) > 0 in this interval, and z(1\u2212) = 0.\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\nAggregative Movement and Front Propagation for Bi-Stable Population Models 1361\nVice versa, let z \u2208 C1(0, 1), satisfying (2.5) in (0, \u03b2) \u222a (\u03b2, 1), and such that\nz(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b2), z(u) > 0 in (\u03b2, 1), z(0+) = z(1\u2212) = 0. First note that if\nD\u02d9(\u03b2) \u0006= 0 then z\u02d9(\u03b2) > 0, while D\u02d9(\u03b2) = 0 implies z\u02d9(\u03b2) = 0.

Maini et al.\nu is a solution of (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3) in (\u03c41, \u03c42). If we denote by I = (a, b) the maximal\nexistence interval of u(t) as a solution of (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3), then the values \u03c41, \u03c42\nhave the same meaning as at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 2.1.\nStep 2. Equation (E) admits solutions satisfying conditions (2.2)\u2013(2.3), if and only\nif c\u22171 \u2265 c\u22172.\nBy virtue of Step 1, the solvability of problem (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3) is equiva-\nlent to the existence of functions z \u2208 C1(0, 1), satisfying (2.5) in (0, \u03b2) \u222a (\u03b2, 1),\nsuch that z(0+) = z(1\u2212) = 0 and z(u) < 0 in (0, \u03b2), z(u) > 0 in (\u03b2, 1).\nObserve now that the existence of negative solutions of (2.5) in (0, \u03b2), satisfying\nz(0+) = z(\u03b2\u2212) = 0 is equivalent to the existence of solutions for (3.2) satisfying\nu(\u2212\u221e) = \u03b2, u(+\u221e) = 0.11 Similarly, it is easy to check that the existence of\npositive solutions of (2.5) in (\u03b2, 1), satisfying z(\u03b2+) = z(1\u2212) = 0 is equivalent to\nthe existence of negative solutions of the equation\nw\u02d9 = \u2212c\u2212 g\u02dc(s)\nw(s)\n, s \u2208 (0, 1\u2212 \u03b2)\nsatisfying w(0+) = w((1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u2212) = 0; indeed it suffices to put w(s) = \u2212z(1 \u2212 s)\n(recall that g\u02dc(s) = \u2212g(1 \u2212 s)). Further, this is equivalent to the existence of C2-\nsolutions u(t) of (3.4), satisfying u(\u2212\u221e) = 1\u2212\u03b2, u(+\u221e) = 0. Therefore, if problem\n(E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3) is solvable for some c, then c = c\u22171, and c\n\u2217\n1 \u2265 c\u22172.\nVice versa, if \u03b1 < \u03b2 and\n\u222b \u03b2\n0\nf(u)D(u) du > 0, then c\u22171 and c\n\u2217\n2 exist and assuming\nc\u22171 \u2265 c\u22172, then for c = c\u22171 there exists a positive function z2 \u2208 C1(\u03b2, 1), solution of\n(2.5) in (\u03b2, 1), satisfying z2(\u03b2+) = z2(1\u2212) = 0 and there exists a negative function\nz1 \u2208 C1(0, \u03b2), solution of (2.5) in (0, \u03b2), satisfying z1(0+) = z1(\u03b2\u2212) = 0. In order\nto conclude the proof, it is sufficient to show that the function z(u), defined by\nz(u) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nz1(u), u \u2208 (0, \u03b2)\n0, u = \u03b2\nz2(u), u \u2208 (\u03b2, 1)\nsatisfies z \u2208 C1(0, 1). To this aim, assume by contradiction\nlim sup\nu\u2192\u03b2+\nz(u)\nu\u2212 \u03b2 := D\n+z(\u03b2) > D+z(\u03b2) := lim sup\nu\u2192\u03b2\u2212\nz(u)\nu\u2212 \u03b2\nand fix \u03bb \u2208 (D+z(\u03b2), D+z(\u03b2)). Let (un)n be a decreasing sequence converging\nto \u03b2, such that\nz(un)\nun \u2212 \u03b2 = \u03bb, and\nd\ndu\n(\nz(u)\nu\u2212 \u03b2\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nu=un\n\u2264 0.\nSince ddu\nz(u)\nu\u2212\u03b2 =\n1\nu\u2212\u03b2 (z\u02d9(u)\u2212 z(u)u\u2212\u03b2 ), we have z\u02d9(un) = \u2212c\u2212 g(un)\u03bb(un\u2212\u03b2) \u2264 \u03bb. Passing to\nthe limit as n \u2192 +\u221e, since \u03bb > 0, we get \u03bb2+c\u03bb+ g\u02d9(\u03b2) \u2265 0. Similarly, if we choose\na decreasing sequence (vn)n converging to \u03b2, such that\nz(vn)\nvn \u2212 \u03b2 = \u03bb, and\nd\ndu\n(\nz(u)\nu\u2212 \u03b2\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nu=vn\n\u2265 0,\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\nAggregative Movement and Front Propagation for Bi-Stable Population Models 1363\nwe can deduce that \u03bb2 + c\u03bb + g\u02d9(\u03b2) \u2264 0. Therefore, we obtain \u03bb2 + c\u03bb + g\u02d9(\u03b2) = 0\nand a contradiction follows from the arbitrariness of \u03bb \u2208 (D+z(\u03b2), D+z(\u03b2)). This\nproves the existence of the limit limu\u2192\u03b2+ z(u)\/(u\u2212 \u03b2) \u2208 [0,+\u221e]. If D\u02d9(\u03b2) \u0006= 0, from\n(2.5) we deduce\nz\u02d9(\u03b2+) = \u2212c\u2212 f(\u03b2)D\u02d9(\u03b2) lim\nu\u2192\u03b2+\nu\u2212 \u03b2\nz(u)\n.\nNotice that, if limu\u2192\u03b2+ z(u)\/(u\u2212\u03b2) = 0 (+\u221e) then z\u02d9(\u03b2+) = +\u221e (0) and this is not\npossible. Hence z\u02d9(\u03b2+) exists and it has the real value 12 (\u2212c+\n\u221a\nc2 \u2212 4f(\u03b2)D\u02d9(\u03b2)). On\nthe other hand, if D\u02d9(\u03b2) = 0, by what we proved in Step 1 we get limu\u2192\u03b2+\nD(u)\nz(u) =\n\u2212 cf(\u03b2) . Hence, from (2.5) we deduce that z\u02d9(\u03b2+) = \u2212c \u2212 f(\u03b2) limu\u2192\u03b2+ D(u)z(u) = 0.\nSimilarly one can prove the existence of the limit z\u02d9(\u03b2\u2212), coincident with z\u02d9(\u03b2+).\nConsequently Eq. (E) with c = c\u22171 admits a solution satisfying (2.2)\u2013(2.3).\nFinally, the uniqueness of the solution (up to translation) derives from the\nuniqueness of the solutions of Eqs. (3.2), (3.4) satisfying the prescribed boundary\nconditions.\nStep 3. Characterization of the t.w.s.\nLet u(t) be the solution of problem (E), (2.2)\u2013(2.3) with c = c\u22171 as shown in\nStep 2. In order to distinguish what kind of solution u(t) is, we need to calculate\nu\u2032(a+) = lim\nt\u2192a+\nu\u2032(t) = lim\nu\u21921\u2212\nz(u)\nD(u)\nand\nu\u2032(b\u2212) = lim\nt\u2192b\u2212\nu\u2032(t) = lim\nu\u21920+\nz(u)\nD(u)\n,\nwhere z(u) is the associated first-order dynamics (see Step 1) satisfying z(0+) =\nz(1\u2212) = 0. When D(1) \u0006= 0, it follows that u\u2032(a+) = 0 hence a = \u2212\u221e and the\nsolution is classical for u near its value 1. Similarly, D(0) \u0006= 0 implies u\u2032(b\u2212) = 0\nhence b = +\u221e and again the solution is classical near u = 0. Consequently, when-\never D(0)D(1) \u0006= 0, both a = \u2212\u221e and b = +\u221e are valid, hence u(t) is a front-type\nsolution.\nConsider now the case when D(1) = 0. Since c\u22171 \u2265 c\u22172, the following problem is\nuniquely solvable\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nw\u02d9(s) = \u2212c\u22171 +\nf(1\u2212 s)D(1\u2212 s)\nw(s)\n, s \u2208 (0, 1\u2212 \u03b2)\nw(s) < 0\nw(0+) = w((1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u2212) = 0\nwith w(s) defined as in Step 2. Reasoning as in Ref. 10, Lemma 5 (see also Ref. 9,\nTheorem 4) it is possible to prove that the limit w\u02d9(0) = lims\u21920+ w(s)\/s exists and it\nis 0 or \u2212c\u22171. In particular, w\u02d9(0) = 0 if and only if c\u22171 > c\u22172 (see Ref. 10, Corollary 11).\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\n1364 P. K. Maini et al.\nFirst assume c\u22171 > c\n\u2217\n2 and show that, in this case, u\n\u2032(a+) = 0. Indeed, this is trivial\nwhen D\u02d9(1) \u0006= 0 since z(u) = \u2212w(1 \u2212 u) implies z\u02d9(1) = 0 and\nu\u2032(a+) = lim\nu\u21921\u2212\nz(u)\nu\nu\nD(u)\n.\nInstead, when D\u02d9(1) = 0 according to the proof of Theorem 4 in Ref. 9, we have\nu\u2032(a+) = lim\nu\u21921\u2212\nz(u)\nD(u)\n= lim\ns\u21920+\nw(s)\nD(1\u2212 s) = 0. (3.11)\nConsequently a = \u2212\u221e and again when D(0) \u0006= 0 the solution u(t) is of front-type.\nNow consider c\u22171 = c\u22172. Since z\u02d9(1) = w\u02d9(0) = \u2212c\u22171, we obtain\nlim\nt\u2192a+\nu\u2032(t) = lim\nu\u21921\u2212\nz(u)\nD(u)\n= lim\nu\u21921\u2212\nz(u)\nu\u2212 1\nu\u2212 1\nD(u)\n= \u2212 c1\u2217\nD\u02d9(1)\n,\nwith the obvious meaning that it is \u2212\u221e when D\u02d9(1) = 0. Therefore a > \u2212\u221e and\nwhen D(0) > 0, b = +\u221e hence u(t) is a sharp solution of type (II).\nIt remains to consider the case when D(0) = 0. Since z(u) satisfies (2.5) in (0, \u03b1)\nwith c = c\u22171, we obtain\nlim\nu\u21920+\n[\nz\u02d9(u) + c\u22171\n]z(u)\nu\n= lim\nu\u21920+\n\u2212f(u)D(u)\nu\n= 0.\nWe recall that z(u) and f(u)D(u) are negative in (0, \u03b1), so by (2.5) it follows that\nz\u02d9(u) < \u2212c\u22171 in (0, \u03b1); this implies limu\u21920+ z\u02d9(u) = \u2212c\u22171, since at u = 0 we have\nz\u02d9(0) = 0 or z\u02d9(0) = \u2212c\u22171. Therefore\nlim\nu\u2192b\u2212\nu\u2032(t) = lim\nu\u21920+\nz(u)\nD(u)\n= lim\nu\u21920+\nz\u02d9(u)\nD\u02d9(u)\n= \u2212 c\n\u2217\n1\nD\u02d9(0)\nwith the obvious meaning that the limit is \u2212\u221e when D\u02d9(1) = 0; in every case\nb < +\u221e. Consequently, when c\u22171 > c\u22172 or c\u22171 = c\u22172 but D(1) < 0, then a = \u2212\u221e and\nu(t) is sharp of type (I) while when c\u22171 = c\n\u2217\n2 and D(1) = 0 also a > \u2212\u221e implying\nthat u(t) is sharp of type (III).\nAs is natural, the necessary and sufficient condition stated in the previous result\nhas an implicit form, since the values of the constants c\u22171 and c\n\u2217\n2 are unknown in\ngeneral. So, in order to make it applicable, we now give some simple conditions,\ndirectly expressed in terms of the coefficients D(u) and f(u), ensuring the validity\nof condition (3.6).\nTheorem 3.2.

From the estimates (3.3), (3.5) of the critical values c\u22171, c\n\u2217\n2, it follows imme-\ndiately that a necessary condition for (3.6) to be satisfied is that\nlim\nu\u21921\u2212\nf(u)D(u)\nu\u2212 1 < supu\u2208(\u03b1,\u03b2]\nf(u)D(u)\nu\u2212 \u03b1 .\nAssume now that all the conditions in (2.4) are satisfied and (3.13) holds. In Ref. 11,\nLemma 4, it was proved that for every c > 0 there exists a unique negative solution\nzc of Eq. (2.5) in its maximal existence interval (0, uc), such that zc(0+) = 0 and\n\u03b1 < uc \u2264 \u03b2. Moreover, if c1 < c2 then uc1 \u2264 uc2 and zc1(u) > zc2(u) in (0, uc1).\nFor every c > 0 let kc := c\n\u221a\n\u03b2 +\n\u221a\nc2\u03b2 + 2m and \u03c6c(u) := \u2212kc\u221au, u \u2208 (0, \u03b2).\nSince k2c = 2ckc\n\u221a\n\u03b2 + 2m > 2ckc\n\u221a\nu + 2m, we have\n\u03c6\u02d9c(u) = \u2212 kc2\u221au < \u2212c\u2212\nm\nkc\n\u221a\nu\n\u2264 \u2212c + g(u)\nkc\n\u221a\nu\n= \u2212c\u2212 g(u)\n\u03c6c(u)\n,\ni.e. \u03c6c is a lower-solution for Eq. (2.5) in (0, \u03b2). Hence, by results proved in Ref. 11,\nLemma 3, we get \u03c6c(u) \u2264 zc(u) in (0, uc). Moreover, since \u03c6c is a strict lower-\nsolution, we have \u03c6c(u) < zc(u) in (0, uc). Indeed, if \u03c6c(u\u00af) = zc(u\u00af) for some u\u00af \u2208\n(0, uc), then \u03c6\u02d9c(u\u00af) < \u2212c\u2212 g(u\u00af)\u03c6c(u\u00af) = \u2212c\u2212\ng(u\u00af)\nzc(u\u00af)\n= z\u02d9c(u\u00af), implying \u03c6c(u) > zc(u) in a\nleft neighborhood of u\u00af, a contradiction.\nHence, integrating equation z\u02d9c(u)zc(u) = \u2212czc(u)\u2212 g(u) in (0, uc) we obtain\n0 \u2264 z2c (u\u2212c ) = \u22122c\n\u222b uc\n0\nzc(u) du\u2212 2\n\u222b uc\n0\ng(u) du\n< 2ckc\n\u222b \u03b2\n0\n\u221a\nu du\u2212 2\n\u222b uc\n0\ng(u) du\n=\n4\n3\nckc\u03b2\n3\/2 \u2212 2\n\u222b uc\n0\ng(u) du,\ni.e. \u222b uc\n0\ng(u) du <\n2\n3\nckc\u03b2\n3\/2 for every c > 0.\nTherefore, if\n2\n3\nckc\u03b2\n3\/2 \u2264\n\u222b \u03b2\n0\ng(u)du, (3.14)\nnecessarily we have uc < \u03b2 implying c < c\u22171. Note that for c = 2\n\u221a\n\u03c3 inequality\n(3.14) then reduces to (3.13), which then implies that 2\n\u221a\n\u03c3 < c\u22171. Therefore, by\n(3.5) we obtain c\u22172 < c\u22171 and by virtue of Theorem 3.1 we get the assertion.\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\n1366 P. K. Maini et al.\nExample 1. Let us consider the equation\n((\u03b2 \u2212 u)u\u2032)\u2032 + cu\u2032 + f(u) = 0 (3.15)\nwhere 0 < \u03b2 < 1 and\nf(u) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nu(\u03b2 + u)(u2 \u2212 \u03b12), u \u2208 [0, \u03b2]\nf(\u03b2) u \u2208 [\u03b2, u0]\na2\n4\n1\u2212u\nu\u2212\u03b2 , u \u2208 (u0, 1]\nwith 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2\/\n\u221a\n3, a > 0 and u0 = u0(a) \u2208 (\u03b2, 1) is the solution of the linear\nequation\na2\n4\n(1 \u2212 u) = f(\u03b2)(u \u2212 \u03b2).\nOf course, f(u) is well-defined and continuous on all [0, 1]; moreover it satisfies\nf(u)(u\u2212\u03b1) > 0 in (0, 1)\\{\u03b1}. Consequently, (3.15) is a diffusion-aggregation process\nwith a Nagumo-type reaction term, depending on the parameter a.\nEquation (3.15) has a unique connection from its stationary states 0 and \u03b2.6 Its\nspeed c\u22171 is the same as the speed of the unique wave connection, in [0, \u03b2], of\nut = uxx + u(\u03b22 \u2212 u2)(u2 \u2212 \u03b12).\nNotice in fact that the wave profile can be obtained, in both cases, from the solutions\nof the following singular boundary value problem\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3 z\u02d9(u) = \u2212c\u2212\nu(\u03b22 \u2212 u2)(u2 \u2212 \u03b12)\nz(u)\nz(0+) = z(\u03b2\u2212) = 0.\n,\nConsequently, by Ref. 6, Example 15, we get\nc\u22171 =\n\u03b22 \u2212 3\u03b12\u221a\n3\n.\nThe constraint on \u03b1 assures that c\u22171 > 0. It is also easy to see that\n\u222b \u03b2\n0 f(u)(\u03b2 \u2212\nu) du > 0.\nIn the interval [\u03b2, 1], Eq. (3.15) supports infinitely many waves with a minimum\nspeed c\u22172 satisfying (3.5) where g(u) is defined in [\u03b2, 1] as follows\ng(u) =\n{\nf(\u03b2)(\u03b2 \u2212 u), u \u2208 [\u03b2, u0],\na2\n4 (u\u2212 1), u \u2208 (u0, 1].\nSince g is convex in [\u03b2, 1] we get c\u22172 = 2\n\u221a\ng\u2032(1) = a. According to Theorem 3, all\nthe cases occur, concerning the existence of a wave connection, on varying of the\nparameter a. In particular, when\n\u03b22 \u2212 3\u03b12\u221a\n3\n\u2265 a,\nAugust 14, 2007 15:33 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00230\nAggregative Movement and Front Propagation for Bi-Stable Population Models 1367\n(3.15) has a unique wave connection from 0 to 1 with speed c\u22171. Its profile is of\nfront-type, since D(u) does not vanish in u = 0 and u = 1. Instead, in the opposite\ncase when\n\u03b22 \u2212 3\u03b12\u221a\n3\n< a,\n(3.15) does not support a wave connection from 0 to 1.\n4. Final Discussion\nIn this paper, we have used upper and lower solutions and comparison techniques\nin the phase plane to investigate front propagation in a reaction-diffusion equation\nwhere the diffusion coefficient changes sign, while the reaction term is bi-stable.\nWhile the latter is a well-known model for the Allee effect, and the former can\ndescribe aggregation-diffusion, our goal is not to apply our results to a specific\nbiological\/ecological example, rather it is to extend the mathematical results avail-\nable for such equations. Travelling wave phenomena arise in models for many areas\nof application, including population dynamics, morphogenesis, wound healing and\ncancer growth. In some of these cases, the models can be caricaturised such that\nthey do have a complicated functional form of diffusion coefficient which changes\nsign. In such cases, our model may well capture the essence of the phenomena and\nour results may transfer across.\nDue to the sign change of the diffusion term D at the point \u03b2, the model supports\na system of wave connections from 1 to \u03b2 and from \u03b2 to 0. However, only when\n\u03b1 < \u03b2 (\u03b1 being the value at which the reaction term changes its sign) do there\nexist connections with the same positive wave speed. In this case, it is possible to\n\u201cglue\u201d them together, resulting in a wave between 1 and 0. As a consequence of this\nanalysis, a population can eventually propagate throughout its habitat (i.e. a front\nbetween 1 and 0 exists) only when aggregating movements prevail over random\ndispersion in a range of values where the population is increasing.\nAs far as we know, the description of the behavior of this system when random\ndispersion and the Allee effect are active together, is still an open question.\nReferences\n1.
