Most major and minor news \norganisations have established an online presence and rapidly growing numbers of \ninternet users increasingly tune in online for their news information (Pew Research \nCentre, 2000). One of the most significant phenomena to occur within this context is \nthe arrival of personalised news sites often produced by individuals with no formal \ntraining in journalism (Allan, 2006). Any news consumer can now be a news \nprovider. These privately produced web-based news logs may offer a personal view \non specific issues, current news events or on the status of mainstream news reports. \nWeblogs of \u201eblogs\u201f as they have come to be known have, within a short space of time, \nbecome established as a form of citizen-based journalism with a growing influence in \nthe wider sphere of news provision (Albrecht, 2006).  \n          Blogging, as it originally emerged, was about more than just news provision. \nMany bloggers are not involved in the discussion of news. Their sites represent \npersonal diaries or forums in which they talk about subjects of personal interest. The \ntechnology has also been utilised, however, to enable ordinary people (and some \nprofessional journalists) to sound off about current issues and events and to become \ninvolved, publicly, in debates about political affairs. Blogs have thus democratised the \nnews. They have opened up the news environment such that everyone has access to a \npublic platform on which they can voice their opinions to mass audiences around the \nworld and engage in networked debates with others (Albrecht, 2006).  \nThe increasing importance of blogs in the context of news has been manifest in \na number of ways \u2013 in terms of the numbers of news blogs that have emerged, the use \nof blogs by mainstream news organisations, and the role they have played in checking \nthe veracity of news stories published by the major news media and in some cases \n 4 \nfinding their inaccuracy to be debatable with sometimes devastating consequences \n(see Allan, 2006).  \nPositioning news blogs in relation to other kinds of blogs is an important \nstarting point, but it is equally important to position news blogs in relation to news \nand journalism.  Debates about the relative merits of news blogs compared to \nconventional journalism are quite extensive with quite stridently oppositional \nviewpoints apparent, even where there is agreement about claims for distinctiveness \nof news blogs (Berlind, 2005; Matheson, 2004; Robinson, 2006).   \nIn considering the implications of news blogging for news provision in general, \nthere are two particularly critical positions that have been articulated.  First, the \nemergence of independent blogs can lead to a loss of control by traditional news \norganisations that could lead to shift away from journalism that is healthy for \ndemocracy.  Some sites may label themselves as news sources, but are actually little \nmore than online platforms for self-interested groups that have a specific agenda other \nthan the provision of accurate and impartial news (see Kovach and Rosensteil in \nBowman and Willis, 2003, p.11).  \nSome mainstream journalists regard (non-journalist) bloggers \u201eas self-interested \nor unskilled amateurs\u201f (Bowman and Willis, 2003, p.13). This is because they (are \nperceived to) have no editorial oversight, no journalism training, and no respect for \nthe profession\u201fs rules and standards (Lasica, 2003, p.70).  Second, in contrast to this, \nis the position that blogging and related developments are good for journalism and \ngood for democracy.  They represent a world in which audiences are no longer \npassive, where there is an increased range of perspectives and a decentralization of \ncontrol over news production and dissemination. According to one commentator \u201eif \nmodern American journalism has been a lecture, it is evolving into something that \n 5 \nincorporates a conversation and seminar\u201f (Dan Gilmour in Bowman and Willis, 2003, \nvi).   \nBloggers, and their proponents regard mainstream journalists \u201eas an arrogant, \nexclusive club that puts its own version of self-interest and economic survival above \nthe societal responsibility of a free press.\u201f (Bowman and Willis, 2003: 13).  In this \ncontext, news blogs are virtuous because knowledgeable bloggers (and those that \nrespond to them) can correct errors and add detail to stories, blogs provide a wider \nrange of opinions and perspectives than traditional media, and blogs can alert \njournalists to new stories and initiate stories. \nBlogging and News \nThere are conflicting positions about the concept of news blogging. One issue that can \nbe debated is whether \u201enews blogs\u201f can be considered as genuine sources of \u201enews\u201f at \nall. If they can, another issue concerns whether there are specific conditions that must \nbe in place for blogs to qualify as \u201enews. Resolving this debate begs the question of \nwhat are the critical aspects of news that blogs must observe to be classified as news \nproviders. For instance, must news blogs be produced only by reputable news \nagencies and providers or professional journalists to be regarded as credible news \nsources? Are there restrictions in terms of the types of content reported or formats of \npresentation adopted to permit a blog to be treated as a legitimate source of real news? \nOr has the time come to introduce a new taxonomy for \u201enews\u201f and the ways it can be \nprovided?    \nThis analysis of blog sites is likely to be informed by studies of online news \nprovision in general. Here there have been debates about the status of online news \nsources, discussions about the increasingly diverse ways in which news can be \nprovided online compared with more traditional print and broadcast platforms, and \n 6 \nanalysis of the emergence of new suppliers outside the established mainstream \n(Abdulla, Garrison, Salwen, Driscoll, & Casey, 2005; Allan, 2006). Have new and \nalternative forms of news provision emerged that have equal legitimacy to the major \nand best known news suppliers? Or do some online providers of content adopt the \nguise of being news suppliers, but without being the genuine article? If this is the \ncase, how do we tell the difference between genuine news and that which is not?   \nThe legitimacy of news suppliers is founded upon reputation that is, in turn, \ngrounded in performance over time. Thus, in understanding what comprises genuine \nnews, we must examine online news provision in the broader context of news in \ngeneral. Can the information value of online news sources through reference to the \nwider provision of news by offline as well as online media?  \nOne position is that the best news derives from high quality journalism. One of \nthe critical issues in determining the quality of journalism is the degree to which it \nobserves standards of objectivity. That is not to say that there is no place for opinion. \nIndeed, some analysts have argued that news provision can be enhanced by highly \ninformed opinion and that this is a direction that could increase the competitiveness of \nestablished offline news providers in the future (Hargreaves & Thomas, 2002). It is \nalso true that online news providers operating in the print arena include editorials and \ncommentaries as routine and quite legitimate aspects of their news services, and yet \nthese elements comprise opinion as much as factual reporting.  Blogging may \ntherefore be conceived, in respect of personal opinion blogs on current issues, as the \nonline equivalents of long-established \u201eop-eds\u201f (opinion columns and editorials) of \nprint newspapers. Even though many people may turn to mainstream news media for \naccounts of events or issues of major importance, they can now also explore blogs as \nalternative sources of analysis of these events and issues (see Lasica, 2003).      \n 7 \nIn Search of the Defining Attributes of News \nThe legitimacy of news sources is ultimately a matter of branding. Does a particular \nnews brand have credibility among news professionals and also among news \nconsumers? The analysis of news blogs therefore must, in part, involve an analysis of \nthe way news audiences engage with these information (or opinion) providers.  \nIn general, the authenticity of news is linked to its credibility. News reporting \nshould strive to attain the highest standards of credibility \u2013 a concept that embraces \nnotions of trustworthiness and reliability (Rosengren, 1977).  Elsewhere, it has been \nargued that objectivity is a key performance criterion. Objectivity in news means that \nit should be free from bias and that it should be factual. The factuality of news is \ndetermined by its truthfulness and its relevance, while impartiality is defined by \nneutrality and balance in news coverage (Westerhahl, 1983).   \nThese terms have been further elaborated. McQuail (1992), for example, \nidentified factualness, accuracy and completeness as key defining aspects of the \ntruthfulness of news. Thus, fact should be clearly differentiated from opinion. News \nreports should correspond with separately verifiable versions of reality. Reports \nshould also provide sufficient detail about stories that news consumers receive an \naccurate impression about what happened. \u201eRelevance\u201f was a further key concept in \nthat the news can only have value to consumers if it touches upon or deals with \nmatters that are of current concern to them.   Relevance is a complex concept, \nhowever, because it must be defined through reference to particular receiver \ncommunities. For whom is the news relevant? \nThe degree of impartiality observed by news can be operationally determined at \na number of levels. In the first instance, bias may occur in the news stories selected \nfor coverage. Thus, impartiality conceived as a lack of balance in the way events and \n 8 \nissues are covered may be determined by whether certain types of news are preferred \nover others by news providers. Then, there may be bias within the stories selected \nwith more attention being given to specific sources or to particular points of view than \nto others (Gunter, 1997). \nDetermining the impartiality of news can also be ascertained through a number \nof modes of analysis. One taxonomic classification of approaches distinguished \nbetween output criteria, external criteria, professional criteria and audience criteria \n(Gunter, 1997).   \nOutput criteria analysis has focused upon the content of news and embraces the \nuse of methodologies such as content analysis and discourse analysis to examine \nbiases in relation to the use of sources (Donohue, Olien & Tichenor., 1985; Tutt, \n1992), biases in choice of words or phrases in reports (Graber, 1976; van Dijk, 1991), \nand the use of different presentational styles and, in particular, the choice of news \npictures and way they are used to support the news narrative (Kepplinger, 1983; \nNimmo & Combs, 1985; Robinson & Levy, 1985). In terms of the traditional aspects \nof news reporting and presentation, early comparisons between offline and online \nnews found few differences, with the same conventions being observed in both \nspheres (Gubman & Greer, 1997). Some online news operators, however, were \nobserved quickly to become more sophisticated in their presentation of news online as \nthe full potential of the new technology was realised (Kamerer & Bressers, 1998; \nPeng, Tham & Xiaming, 1999). Yet in some markets, the interactive capabilities of \nthe internet were still not always fully realised among online trail-blazers (Massey & \nLevy, 1999).   \nExternal source criteria are concerned with the search for accuracy and \ntruthfulness in news reporting by counter-checking the facts provided against \n 9 \nindependent sources of evidence. These sources of verification may comprise \nindependent experts (Berry, 1967; Tillinghast, 1983) or direct observation of events \nthat can then be compared with their representation in news reports (Halloran, Elliott \n& Murdock, 1970; Altheide & Snow, 1979). Comparisons can also be made between \nreports of the same events provided by different news providers to determine the \nextent to which they tally or differ from each other (McQuail, 1977).Verification of \nfacts and details of stories is an essential process underpinning good journalism \n(Newhagen & Levy, 1998). In the context of the internet where vast amounts of \ninformation are in circulation and a central part of the ethos is relentless updating, \nthere may be pressures or temptations to take short-cuts. Within the blog context, \nhowever, it has been argued that bloggers check out each others\u201f facts and do so very \nquickly so that inaccuracies are rooted out and not tolerated for very long (Allan, \n2006).    \nProfessional criteria refer to the gate-keeping role that journalists and their \neditors play in selecting stories for coverage. Story selection is determined by \nnewsworthiness criteria that are often intuitively applied (Gans, 1979). There is \nevidence, however, that certain types of story are more likely to be selected than \nothers for a range of reasons associated with beliefs among news providers about \nwhat will attract an audience (Bogart, 1979). Some commentators have argued that \nthis \u201enews values\u201f orientation has often led to disproportionate focus on bad news \n(Haskins, 1981; Haskins & Miller, 1984).   In the internet context, as examined \nfurther below, the professionalism of news produced online has been questioned \nparticularly in relation to fact checking (accuracy) and the impact of new forms of \nstory-telling on the established norms and integrity of journalism (Deuze, 2005; \nOnline News Association, 2002; Ruggerio, 2004)     \n 10 \nAudience criteria derive from research conducted amongst news consumers. \nMedia researchers working in this area have surveyed public opinion about the \nperceived credibility or impartiality of news channels (Gunter & McLaughlin, 1982;  \nGunter, Sancho-Aldridge & Winstone, 1994),  news suppliers or \u201ebrands\u201f (Gunter, \n2005), and the impact of news presentation and narrative features on audience \nmemory and understanding of news (Gunter, 1987; Robinson & Levy, 1985). Other \nresearch has studied the impact of the way stories are written and emphasise specific \npoints of view on audience perceptions of issues (Entman, 1991, 1993; Iyengar, \n1990).    \nThese credibility judgements have, to some extent, been observed among online \nnews consumers. The credibility of online news is linked both to the specific news \nprovider and its reputation (Center for the Digital Future, 2005; Pew Research Centre, \n2000) and to a holistic perception of the internet as a medium (Choi, Watt, & Lynch, \n2006). The remainder of this paper will focus on audience criteria in relation to rating \nnews credibility and in turn for determining the significance of blogs as genuine news \nproviders. \nOnline Versus Offline News Credibility \nFor many years the mainstream news media have commanded a significant level of \npublic trust. Objectivity has represented a core principle in professional journalistic \npractice (McQuail, 1982). While political partisanship has flavoured the perspectives \nof print media, news broadcasters have been further constrained by the need to \nobserve strict conditions of balance and neutrality in their news provision. Among the \npublic service broadcasters in countries such as the United Kingdom, the requirement \nto ensure that news is presented with due impartiality is enshrined in broadcasting \nlegislation and the charters and licences of the broadcasters. Such principles have \n 11 \ncontributed significantly to how much these mainstream news sources have come to \nbe trusted by the public.  \nIn comparisons between news media, television has frequently emerged as more \ntrusted than other news media, especially print media. It has been identified as the \nmost objective news media (Finberg, Stone & Lynch, 2002), and the medium to \nwhich people turn first for coverage of major national and international news (Gunter, \nSancho-Aldridge and Winstone, 1994). It is also the medium people said they would \ntrust most if faced with conflicting reports in television and newspapers (Lee, 1975; \nRubin, 1983).  \nCritical incidents can call into question the reliability of even the most trusted \nnews institutions, as the BBC discovered in 2003 after one of its premier radio news \nbroadcasts contained a report questioning the veracity of the UK government\u201fs case \nfor the Iraq war that turned out to be based on inaccurate details. A subsequent public \nenquiry criticised the BBC editorial procedures on this occasion and also called for \nmore sweeping changes to BBC journalistic controls and practices and to the \ngovernance of the Corporation. Public opinion surveys found that confidence in the \nBBC had been shaken at least temporarily and that a number of key individuals \ninvolved in this case have behaved improperly (Gunter, 2005). Even so, significant \nmajorities of people still trusted the major news organisations in the UK and saved \ntheir distrust for those news brands that were traditionally regarded as more partisan \nanyway (Gunter, 2005). \nIn some news markets, however, trust even in the major broadcasters has waned. \nResearch conducted by the Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press in 2006 \nreported that only minorities of the US public said they believed all or most of what \nthey saw on NBC News (23%; down from 30% in 1998), ABC News (22%; down \n 12 \nfrom 30%), or CBS News (22%; down from 26%), in every case a reduction in \nprevalence of trust over time. Even CNN fared little better, with its approval rate \nfalling from 40% in 1998 to 26% in 2006 (Crupi, 2006). Print news media have also \nexperienced a fall in public trust. American research revealed a sharp drop in the \npercentages of people who said they believed what they read in newspapers from 84% \nin 1985 to 59% in 2006 (Pew Research Centre, 2006).  \nThe emergence of the internet as a news source since the mid-1990s has altered \nthe news landscape and introduced people to an alternative news reception platform, \nalthough one that is not totally disconnected from established news media. A number \nof comparisons of the relative perceived credibility of online and offline news have \nbeen published, but their findings reveal a complex picture of disparate and volatile \nopinions. Some studies of credibility perceptions have also been carried out among \nmedia professionals who have been invited to give their own opinions and to estimate \nthe nature of public opinion (Middleburg\/Ross Media Survey, 2002; Weaver, Beam, \nBrownless, Voakes, & Wilhoit, 2003).  \nAt the turn of the millennium, internet news was found still to lag behind \nnewspapers, television and radio in perceived credibility terms (Flanagin & Metzger, \n2000; Kiousis, 2001). Over time, though, the internet has caught up with the \nmainstream media in platform comparisons (Online News Association, 2002). \nPerceptions of lack of accuracy or bias in internet news provision have arisen from \nobservations that standards of fact and source checking are less stringent than they are \nin the case of mainstream offline news provision by major news broadcasters and \nnewspapers (Abdulla, Garrison, Salwen, Driscoll, & Casey, 2004; Bucy, 2003; \nSundar, 1999).     \n 13 \n        In the UK, comparisons between levels of public trust in mainstream \nbroadcast news sources and the internet as a news source saw the internet trailing. In \n2006, clear majorities said they would place trust in news on BBC (85%) and ITV \n(785), the two biggest public service news providers, a narrow majority ((56%) said \nthey would trust Channel 4, and a minority (42%) expressed their trust in Five News.  \nThe internet commanded the trust of markedly fewer people (29%). What is \nsignificant about these results, however, is that in every case, the extent of public trust \nin news on the mainstream public service television operators\u201f services declined in \n2006 compared with 2002, while prevalence of trust in the internet over that period \nincreased (Ofcom, 2007).        \n      In the United States, research among a sample of internet users found that \nnot only was online news preferred to offline news, but it was also trusted as much. \nAmong this sample, the medium obtaining the most prevalent endorsement as the \n\u201emost credible\u201f news source was newspapers (35%), with the internet on level \npegging with television (18% each) (Bello Interactive, 2004). The most preferred \nonline news source varied, however, with the type of news being considered. For local \nnews, for example, a web site associated with a local newspaper (by 48%) was \npreferred ahead of  one provided by a local TV station (42%). For sports news, a local \nnewspaper site was again the most often preferred (by 51%). For international news, a \nnational TV network site (33%) was preferred ahead of a national newspaper web site \n(21%). These findings reveal that news source preferences and perceptions can be \naffected not only by the impressions about the credibility of a news medium, but also \nof a news brand. Moreover, specific news sources may be regarded as authoritative in \nrespect of one type of news and not another (Bello Interactive, 2004). \n 14 \nComparisons of the credibility of major news media have sometimes focused on \ntheir coverage of specific events. In this type of case, the pre-existing orientations of \nnews consumers can represent powerful mediators of judgements about news media \nperformance. One online survey of the responses of US citizens to coverage of the \n2003 Iraq war found that the relative credibility of the internet and other media as \nnews sources varied with whether respondents supported or opposed the war. Among \nsupporters of the war, television was regarded as the most credible war news source \nahead of the internet. Opponents to the war, in contrast, rated the internet as the most \ncredible medium, followed by newspapers, television and finally radio. Television \nwas judged in a separate analysis to have been mostly supportive of the war. In \nconsequence war supporters regarded it as a significantly more credible source than \ndid war opponents. The internet was seen as carrying both anti-government and pro-\ngovernment material in relation to the war, and offered war opponents more content \nsupportive of their perspective (Choi, Watt & Lynch, 2006).     \nIn view of the observation about making comparisons between news sources, it \nis questionable when investigating the credibility of online news just how useful \nblanket comparisons between the \u201einternet\u201f and other mass media can be. Equally, \ncomparisons between the \u201einternet\u201f as a general news source and specific TV news \nchannels or newspapers may be meaningless. Such comparisons may have more \nmeaning in special cases such as the nature of reporting in different media of major \nevents, such as wars ((Choi et al., 2006). What could be more significant, however, is \nto determine the perceived credibility of specific news suppliers identified by brand \nname, whether they operate in the offline or online world. \nHaving said that, research with news professionals has revealed that many \njournalists believe that online news sites fail to meet the same journalistic standards as \n 15 \nthose found in mainstream print and broadcast news (Online News Association, \n2002). This judgement was made independently of any distinctions by news brand. \nThis perception is reinforced by the admission of some online news editors, that less \ntime is spent verifying facts with online posts compared with news intended for \npublication via a mainstream, conventional news medium (Arant & Anderson, 2001). \nYet journalists who work for online news providers place greater trust in web-based \nnews sources that more traditional sources in terms of perceived source accuracy, \nbelievability, fairness and overall credibility (Cassidy, 2007).   \nAt the same time, the negative views of online news voiced by news \nprofessionals may represent a defensive reaction to a new medium perceived as a \nthreat to traditional journalistic values and procedures.  Changes to established \njournalism practices are certainly encouraged by online news because the available \ntechnology allows for different forms of news presentation and allows for a different \nquality of (interactive) engagement with news audiences (Deuze, 2001). The internet \nalso invites news audiences to become news suppliers or even publishers in their own \nright. Some professional journalists are uneasy about the impact of amateurs on the \nquality of content that is published as \u201ejournalism\u201f and the eventual knock-on effect \non the reputation of the profession (Ruggiero, 2004). \nEven the opinions of journalists have been found to vary and to have changed \nover time. Journalists have been observed increasingly to use the internet as a news \ngathering tool and to utilise online sources (Weaver et al., 2003). Further, in \ncomparisons of perceptions of journalists who worked for print and online \nnewspapers, the latter held the internet in significantly higher esteem as a credible \nnews source than did the former, although even those working in print journalism did \nnot dismiss online sources as totalling lacking in credibility (Cassidy, 2007). \n 16 \nAs a news source, the reputation of the internet remains fluid. Ultimately, the \ncredibility of news, whether derived online or offline, is mediated by the reputation of \nthe supplier \u201ebrand\u201f and the relative neutrality or partisanship of news consumers in \nrelation to specific news issues. It may be less insightful to conceive of the internet as \na single news \u201emedium\u201f and instead to think about it as being a repository of news \ncontent provided by a multitude of suppliers. In that respect, the focus, in terms of \ncredibility should be placed on specific news suppliers. This view has been reinforced \nby empirical evidence from news audiences. Internet users have been found to trust \nonline news produced by established and well-known news providers more than that \ngenerated by independent online news sources (Center for the Digital Future; Pew \nResearch Centre, 2000). Even more poignantly, with major news brands, their online \nnews provision is trusted more than their traditional news provision (Rainie, Fox & \nFallows, 2003).   \nThe research reviewed in this section that has compared the internet as a \nmedium with other news media may provide some insights into initial stereotyped \nimage formation about the \u201ecommunity\u201f of online news, but did not single out blogs \nas a particular type of online news supplier. In view of the apparent significance of \nnews \u201ebrand\u201f to news credibility, this is an important omission.                \nNews, Blogs and Credibility  \nThe blogging phenomenon as it occurs in relation to news has opened up many fresh \nopportunities for new news suppliers and established news providers to reach \naudiences for news. Different sources of evidence have been considered in \ndetermining whether blogs are credible news sources. First, the extent to which blogs \nare used has been taken as one type of evidence. The volume of traffic blogs attract is \nindicative of their significance as news providers on the self-evidence grounds that if \n 17 \nthey had nothing useful to contribute, no one would use them. Second, the responses \nof users to blogs in terms of judgements about the accuracy, authority, believability, \ncomprehensiveness, and timeliness of their content provide another indication of \ncredibility. Third, the nature of the source behind a blog and the transparency of their \nagenda represent a further indicator of credibility. \nIt has been argued that more people are turning not just to the internet, but to \nblogs because they are losing faith in mainstream news media. The fact that many \nqualified journalists have joined the community of bloggers has eroded the distinction \nbetween journalists and bloggers. Even so, users must be able to trust bloggers \u2013 even \nif they are also professional journalists. Citizen journalists also have to earn \ncredibility. The hope must then be that quality will rise to the top and that blogs \nconveying news have the same credibility as that attached to mainstream news \nproviders (Berlind, 2005).     \nAny consideration of the significance of the \u201eaudience\u201f in connection with \nblogs, however, is complicated by the fact that members of the audiences for blogs are \noften producers of news as well as its recipients. Traditionally, of course, it is nothing \nnew for professional news providers to monitor each other\u201fs news agendas and to \ngauge the newsworthiness of issues and the best presentation practices from the \noutputs of competitors. With blogging, however, the status of news producers has \nbeen opened up to anyone to join in. Bloggers may follow and feed off one another, \nand bloggers and professional news media may also follow and feed off each other. \nProducers are audience members and audience members increasingly have become \nproducers of news. \nThe Use of Blogs as News Sources \n 18 \nThere is ample anecdotal evidence about the spread of news blogs, especially \nfollowing the events of 11 September 2001 (see Allan, 2006). At that time, bloggers \nfilled a niche left by the mainstream news media. There was unprecedented demand \nfor up-to-the-minute information about the dramatic events of that day which even \nmajor news agencies own web sites could not cope with. Bloggers offered not just \nalternative sources but sources that were at least accessible. \nA number of agencies have published statistics on the spread of blogs and \nblogging behaviour, but these have rarely separated out blogs devoted exclusively or \nprimarily to news. One online source collated data on blogging from a variety of \nagencies since 2001 (Caslon.com, 2006). Caslon noted that Wired News had found \n41,000 bloggers in January 2002 using Blogger to create weblogs. By mid-2006, this \nnumber had grown to 500,000+. Another blog auditor, Blogcount, reported between \n2.4 million and 2.9 million active blogs in June 2003. Perseus apparently claimed \nthere were 4.1 million blogs by October 2003. Technorati tracked down 2.4 million \nblogs in May 2004, but this figure has increased dramatically by June 2005 to 11.7 \nmillion.    \nSystematic audience research studies of the use of news blogs have so far been \nrare. Perhaps the most substantive data have derived from the Pew Internet and \nAmerican Life Project. Data published by Pew in 2006 indicated that nearly four in \nten (39%) American internet users reportedly read blogs. Fewer than one in ten (8%) \nsaid they actually kept a blog (Lenhart & Fox, 2006). Nonetheless, this still amounted \nto 12 million American bloggers in total.  \nA small-scale survey was conducted by Pew that focused on bloggers indicated \nthat one in twenty (5%) indicated that they maintained blogs with news or current \naffairs themes. The most popular types of blogs concerned the bloggers\u201f personal life \n 19 \nexperiences (37%). Thus, in the United States, fewer than half of one per cent of \ninternet users reportedly produced news blogs (Lenhart & Fox, 2006).  \nOver half of bloggers (54%) were aged under 30 years whereas fewer than one \nin four (24%) of American internet users fell in this age bracket. Hence, bloggers \u2013 in \nthe United States at least \u2013 have a younger age profile than do internet users in \ngeneral. Interestingly, bloggers were evenly split in terms of gender. \nBlogging takes up time. Nearly six in ten US bloggers (59%) said they spent \nbetween one and two hours a week working on their blogs. One in ten spent more \nthan 10 hours a week on this activity. \nAlthough just five per cent of US bloggers said they produced sites with news or \ncurrent affairs themes, a far higher percentage (34%) considered their own blog as a \nform of journalism. More than half of all bloggers (56%) also reported spending extra \ntime on verifying facts before posting content to their blogs. \nBloggers are reliant on the internet for their news. Compared with under three in \nfour internet users in general (74%), over nine in ten (95%) of bloggers said they get \nnews from the internet. Bloggers (72%) were also proportionately more likely than \ngeneral internet users (58%) to go online for news about politics. A significant \nminority of American bloggers (45%) said they preferred to get their news from \nsources that do not have a particular political point of view \u2013 largely in line with \ngeneral internet users. It also emerged that many bloggers seek out sources of political \nnews and commentary that challenge their own viewpoint (24%), while others (18%) \nseek out sources that share their political opinions. One of the clearest differences \nbetween bloggers and internet users in general emerged in relation to their respective \nuse of blogs as news sources. Proportionately five times as many bloggers (47%) as \n 20 \ngeneral internet users (9%) said they get their news from blogs (Lenhart & Fox, \n2006).   \nThe Pew research also found that news-seeking bloggers and general internet \nusers were very similar in their respective levels of endorsement of online news as a \nconvenient source to use (42% and 40%) and both found online news sources \nappealing to similar degrees because the provide a more diverse array of viewpoints \nagainst which to check out stories (28% and 29% respectively). What is also clear \nhowever is that blogs represent a specific category of online news source that attract \nother bloggers proportionately much more often than non-blogging internet users.  \nCaslon.com (2006) reported research in the United Kingdom by the British \nMarket Research Bureau conducted in April 2006 that found that seven in ten people \nsurveyed (70%) had heard of blogging. The same survey also found that just two per \ncent of UK internet users had published blogs and one in ten (10%) said they viewed a \nweblog once a month or more. It is not clear from these results to what extent blog \nusers visited news blogs. \nThe same online source reported a further survey conducted among internet \nusers in the UK by  Metro and Telegraph Media that found that one in seven \nrespondents (13% claimed to have read a blog in the preceding week (Caslon.com, \n2006). This figure was lower than equivalent comparison figures obtained for the \nUnited States (40%) and France (25%), but higher than Denmark (12%). More \nrelevant to this review, the same study found that 12 per cent of UK readers had read \na newspaper blog during the week they were surveyed, lower than the equivalent \nfigure for the United States (24%) but higher than France (10%) and Denmark (9%). \nIn more general terms, around nine out of ten UK internet users (89%) said they had \nused a website for news in the past week (compared with 95% in US, 81% in France \n 21 \nand 78% in Denmark). What is significant here is that the data seem to indicate that \nblogs produced by established news providers are attracting much of the news blog \ntraffic. \nPerceptions of Blogs as News Sources       \nOne central aspect of impression formation about news sources is their credibility. \nThis is a factor taken into account by news consumers when judging the quality of \njournalism normally associated with established news brands. It has been recognised \nby news producers as having important implications for business success (Schweiger, \n2000). If the quality of journalism of a news supplier is called into question publicly \nfor reasons of accuracy of reporting, behaving in a non-ethical fashion or presenting \nnews in an unattractive fashion, the credibility of the news brand can suffer (Arant & \nAnderson, 2000; Lasica, 2001). Credibility attaches to media platforms as well as to \nspecific news suppliers. \nIn the traditional offline context, \u201ebrands\u201f have tended to be associated with \nplatforms. In other words, specific news providers tended to work primarily in one \nmedium only, with the exception of a provider such as the BBC that operated within \ntwo media (television and radio) in the broadcasting sector. With the emergence of the \nonline world, the news media landscape has radically altered. Today major news \nproviders more often than not operate across more than one platform. Newspapers and \nbroadcast news suppliers compete directly against each other on the internet. \nHowever, there is evidence that the reputation of established news brands can follow \nthem from the offline to the online world (Gunter, 2005).         \nA number of researchers have made comparisons between the internet and other \nmedia in terms of their relative credibility as news sources. One of the key \nobservations about the internet is that information can be uploaded and published \n 22 \nwithout necessarily having to go through a rigorous editorial and fact-checking \nprocess (Johnson & Kaye, 1998). With other major newspapers such as television, \nradio and newspapers, published news has been carefully selected and checked. This \ndifference raises questions about the veracity of online news from unknown news \nbrands or from sources that deploy uncertain quality control procedures (Flanagin & \nMetzger, 2000).  \nThe relative credibility ratings of different media have been found to vary \nbetween countries. Despite the greater trust placed in television as a medium than any \nother within the UK (e.g., Gunter et al., 1994), in Germany, newspapers were rated as \nmore credible than television (Schweiger, 2000). Meanwhile the German public rated \nthe internet as having similar credibility to television and newspapers across a range \nof credibility ratings (Schweiger, 2000). In the USA, evidence has emerged that \npeople rate newspapers more highly than television or the internet in terms of their \nrespective credibility levels. News on the internet, however, was trusted more than \ntelevision news (Kiousis, 1999).  \nAlthough the public may have begun to accept online news as a credible news \nsource, journalists themselves have been found to disagree with this view. Media \nprofessionals have voiced scepticism about the credibility of online news sources, \nwhile recognising that such sources have captured public trust (Finberg, Stone & \nLynch, 2002). What has emerged from research into public trust in news in the UK is \nthat the most trusted news sources, whether offline or online, are those with the \nlongest established brands (Gunter, 2005). Hence, one wonders how meaningful it is \nto ask people to rate \u201emedia\u201f in terms of credibility when each specific medium \u2013 \nwhether television, radio, newsprint or the internet \u2013 provides a platform for a \nmultitude of different news providers. Even more sophisticated approaches to \n 23 \nassessing perceived credibility of news media utilising a range of different ratings \n(e.g., accuracy, balance, believability, bias, fairness, factuality, honesty, objectivity, \nreliability, sensationalism, timely, trustworthiness, etc) still focus on each medium as \nif it is a homogenous news supplier, which it is not (see Abdulla, Garrison, Salwen, \nDriscoll, & Casey, 2005; Gaziano & McGrath, 1986; Johnson & Kaye, 1998, 2000; \nSundar, 1999).   \nTrust in Blogs \nA question that applies to all online information sources is, \u201ehow much can the \ninformation provided be trusted?\u201f The answer to this question will play a critical part \nin determining the reputation of any news sources, whether it operates online or \noffline.  This principle may apply to blogs as well especially given their highly \npersonal and opinionated nature and the fact that anyone can create a blog and publish \ntheir thoughts on any subject they like, regardless of whether they are qualified to do \nso.  The more prominent and influential news blogs become, the greater the \nimperative will be to know whether they can be trusted \nConcerns about news blogs\u201f reputation can be set against broader questions \nabout credibility of any media outlets with audiences. Public trust in news sources can \nbe mediated by their experiences and contingent perceptions linked to the news \nmedium through which those sources operate as well as by their experiences with \nspecific news brands. Thus, trust in the information supplied by blogs may partially \nbe grounded in general perceptions about the internet as a news medium. In addition, \nspecific blogs may establish a brand image defined by the credulity and accuracy of \nthe information they usually supply. \nMany studies so far have looked at blogs as a generality, whereas a more \naccurate impression of their reliability may be gleaned from a closer examination of \n 24 \nspecific brands. Previous research has shown that both media and brands invoke \nvarying degrees of public trust in the context of news provision. Television has \ncommanded more trust from the public that newspapers, for example (Gunter, \nSancho-Aldridge & Winstone, 1994). Even among television news suppliers, \nhowever, trust in them as news sources can vary (Gunter, 2006). Once trust is \nestablished, however, even severe criticisms of news brands cannot shake public \nconfidence \u2013 at least for very long. This observation was underpinned by surveys of \npublic opinion concerning the trustworthiness of the BBC and other major news \n\u201ebrands\u201f in the aftermath of the Hutton enquiry in the UK during 2004 and 2005 \n(Gunter, 2005). \nWhile the internet in general has some way to go before it commands the level \nof trust of longer-established media such as television and the quality press, within the \nonline environment, trust levels vary with the brand of the supplier. Established news \nbrands offline that have migrated online tend to command greater trust than newer \nonline-only brands (Gunter, 2006). \nThere are signs, however, that the gap in trust in the internet and other longer-\nestablished media is eroding, at least in some media markets. By 2005, the \nproportions of American online users who felt they could trust news most or all of the \ntime in newspapers and television news broadcasts (56%) and on news web sites \n(54%) hardly differed at all (Consumer Reports Web Watch, 2005). However, it is \nlikely than many of the same brands were being compared here in their offline and \nonline guises. Perhaps more significantly, consumer advice web sites (31%), \ncorporate web sites (29%) and blogs posted by individuals (12%) were far less likely \nto be regarded as accurate and reliable most or all of the time. Indeed, in respect of \n 25 \nblogs, most respondents (57%) felt that these could be regarded as accurate and \nreliable only sometimes or never. \n Research by the Center for Digital Future at USC Annenberg School confirmed \nthe above findings with only a minority of web users surveyed (12%) saying they felt \nthat most or all information posted on web sites by individuals was accurate and \nreliable. In contrast, a significant majority (79%) recorded an opinion or trust in the \ninformation on web sites set up by established news organisations such as The New \nYork Times and CNN (Center for Digital Future, 2005).    \nThere are mixed opinions emerging specifically about blogs, however. It may be \nunfair to compare them directly in trustworthiness terms with larger and longer-\nestablished news brands. This may be the case especially if we conceive of the role of \nblogs as being different from that of mainstream news organisations. Research in the \nUnited States, for example, has indicated a demand for opinionated commentary that \nmakes no pretence at impartiality.  One survey of 3,747 regular web users in the US \n(predominantly white, male and wealthy) found that for such users blogs are \nperceived to be the most reliable information outlet, partly because they offer more \n\u201edepth and thoughtful analysis\u201f  than traditional media (Johnson and Kaye, 2004: \n633). \nWhile online news consumers may seek opinion as well as fact, there is \nmounting evidence that they need to know which it is they are confronted with on \nspecific web sites. Most online users, for instance, consider that it is important that \nnews web sites clearly advertising content from news content (Consumer Reports \nWeb Watch, 2005).    \nTechnorati Japan and Edelman Japan (2006) surveyed Japanese bloggers. In this \nsurvey they asked bloggers about how much they trusted online sources when seeking \n 26 \nto find out about products. The most trusted sources were corporate web sites of \nmanufacturers (by 70.4% of bloggers), followed by a corporate news release (62.9%), \nand then a long way back in the rank order, business blogs (28.6%), a blog by a \ncompany employee (19.7%), and then other general blogs (15%). \nComparisons with data from bloggers in North America and Western Europe \nindicated different patterns of trust in online sources among Japanese bloggers than \namong those in the west.  In the west, the most trusted online sources were general \nblogs (62.9%), followed a long way back by corporate websites (26.2%). Other \nsources commanded little trust: business blogs (6.1%) and corporate news releases \n(4.9%).   \n  Trammell, Porter, Chung and Kim (2006) examined the use of blogs by \ncommunications professionals via an online survey of journalists and public relations \npersonnel. Those individuals who used blogs more often also attached greater \ncredibility to them. Banning, Trammell and Trammell (2006) reported on links \nbetween credibility, the third-person effect and blog use. A national telephone survey \nwas conducted with 575 respondents. Blog authors felt that blogs had greater \ncredibility than did non-bloggers. Such findings are consistent with the opinions of \nonline versus offline journalists about the credibility of online news sources. Those \nwho worked within the medium trusted it more than those who did not (Cassidy, \n2007).   \n \nWho and What to Trust? \nPeople tend to trust the news media they opt to use or use most often. For instance, \nonline news users have been found to trust online news more than television news \nviewers trust television news and more than newspaper readers trust newspapers \n 27 \n(Abdulla, et al., 2005). Such research is limited in what it reveals about trust in news \nsources because it focused on generalised perceptions about news media and not \nabout sources that operate within those media. Nonetheless, it does represent part of \nmounting evidence that growing numbers of people are turning to online news and do \nso because it is trusted and because it is current and up to date.  \nIn their search for current and authoritative news, news consumers demand both \nalternative perspectives in news presentation and delivery and also news they can \ntrust. Well known brands have an advantage in that they enjoy long-established \nreputations that pull consumers to their news outputs, whatever the platform on which \nthey operate.  \nThe need for assurances about the quality of online news has been reinforced by \ncases where even supposedly mainstream news providers have been duped in \ncyberspace. One prime example of this sort was the case of 15 year-old Tom Vandetta \nwho posted fake online press releases claiming to be Google\u201fs youngest employee. \nHours after posting this release, he found through leading news search tool, Digg, that \nit had become established as a news story on the internet, with even Google news \ndisplaying a reference to it. The story was later exposed as a fake, but it also exposed \na credibility problem for the Google News system (Hedger, 2006).     \nA paradox is found in the apparently contradictory positions that news \ncredibility can be strengthened if the source is a well-known news brand and yet the \nemergence of blogs has been driven in part by an appetite for alternative to \nmainstream news sources. There is evidence that blogs can become trusted without \nalignment to the mainstream and that blogs directly associated with major news \norganisations may lack public confidence because for some it is part of the intrinsic \ndefinition of blogs that they are not part of the mainstream. Yet, there needs to be \n 28 \nsome way of judging the authority of blogs and this must ultimately derive from \nevidence of the authority and agenda transparency of the source. \nEstablished brands have great power to authenticate online news sites. Among \nonline news users in the UK, many sought out the sites operated by the big news \nbrands of the television stations they usually watched or newspapers they usually \nread. These news providers were also the most trusted. Among newer online news \nsuppliers, again the big brands fared best. Although not yet attaining the heights of \npublic trust enjoyed by certain major news broadcasters and newspapers, Google \nnews and Yahoo News attracted patronage that surpassed that of some longer \nestablished offline news suppliers (Gunter, 2006). Blogs, of course, must tread a \ndelicate balance between display of signs of credibility and distinctiveness from the \nmainstream of news provision.   \nThe willingness of blog authors to disclose their identity and motivations can go \na long way towards enhancing their credibility. This information, in turn, establishes \ntheir quality as news sources. For some writers on this subject, authority underlines \ncredibility.  In a comparison of blogs produced by clearly identified authoritative or \nexpert sources on selected issues versus those produced in the same domain by \nauthors who did not disclose their identity or qualifications, evidence emerged that the \nformer produced blogs with more unquoted content and more links to other news \nsources, and were much more likely to present posted comments from others on their \nsites (Ulicny & Baclawski, 2007).         \n \nDo Blogs have to be Mainstream to be Credible as News? \nThe significance of established and mainstream news providers in the blogosphere is \nfurther underlined by the observed centrality of traditional news media outlets to the \n 29 \nactivities and influences of blogs.  Rather than producing news themselves, many \n\u201enews\u201f blogs essentially provide distinctive kinds of contents that relate to, comment \non, interrogate, analyse, and sometimes, seemingly when mainstream news media \nomit information, or make factual mistakes, influence the agenda of mainstream \nmedia news news.  In that sense, the term of \u201ej-blog,\u201f for journalism-blog, would seem \na more pertinent classification of these kinds of blogs, as news reporting is only one \nkind of journalism.   \nA potential emerging relationship between mainstream news media and news \nblogs in terms of routines of news reporting, however, cannot be systematically \nappraised through a focus on detailed examination of a few high profile news events.  \nPartly this is because, as Robinson (2006) usefully notes, some blogs \u201eare \u201espot \nblogs\u201f, meaning they are created for one particular event or story\u201f p. 70) quite often in \nrelation to a major crisis or other high profile event (like an election), and thus may \nnot be typical. \nIn order to appraise news blogs in more routine context, a trend is evident in \nstudies that examine blogs through a variety of conventional models of news and \njournalism.  One of these approaches has been to look at one particular j-blog, and try \nto analyse it in relation to established conventions of journalistic practice and theory.  \nMatheson (2004), for instance, attempted this in relation to the British national \nnewspaper, The Guardian\u201fs blog, monitored for a month in 2002 (p. 447).  \nMatheson\u201fs analysis focused on evidence of the \u201erules, routines, and procedures\u201f that \ncharacterised the news blog through looking at aspects of \u201elayout, style, voice, textual \ncoherence and forms of hypertext reference, and most particularly by implicitly \ncontrasting these with the textual practice of Anglo-American print news\u201f (Matheson, \n2005, pp. 447-448).   \n 30 \nMatheson (2004) highlights how debates about news blogs are routinely \ncouched in traditional concerns within journalism, including their role as \u201ea space for \njournalistic thinking for which institutional journalism provides little room\u2026 a \nchallenge to corporate journalism; and\u2026 as a democratic, interactive space\u201f (p. 451).  \nMatheson\u201fs (2004) analysis of The Guardian weblog does not sit within that \ntraditional critical framework, instead seeing the blog as responding to new media \n\u201ealong three dimensions: the establishment of a different interpersonal relation, of a \ndifferent authority and of a journalism focused upon connection rather than fact\u201f \n(p.453).  These responses indicate changes, in this case within an established \ntraditional news organisation, in how journalists relate to their audience, their sense of \nprofessional authority, and the markers of credibility, authority and trust.  Instead \nthen, of seeing blogs simply as a kind of binary opposite (either it is journalism or it is \nnot), Matheson (2004) suggests that \u201ethe weblog is grounded in traditional notions of \nthe role of the journalist, but provides evidence of those notions undergoing some \nchange\u201f (p. 460) (see also Rosen, 2005 for a discussion of the blogging\/journalism \nrelationship along these lines.).  \nA study by Robinson (2006) study in some ways extends Singer\u201fs, but looked in \nmore qualitative depth at a range of mainstream media blogs.  He identified seven \ndifferent forms of news blog: \u201ea reporter\u201fs notebook of news tidbits and incidentals; a \nstraight column or opinion for the Web; a question-and-answer format by editors; a \nreadership forum; a confessional diary written by the reporter about his or her beat; a \nround-up of news summaries that promote the publication; and a rumour-mill blog \nthat the report uses as an off-the-record account\u201f (Robinson, 2006, p. 70).  \nIn fact, within the variety of types of content offered by blogs \u201erarely do blogs \ncontain news\u201f in the sense of conventional definitions (Robinson, 2006, p.76).  \n 31 \nInstead, echoing the ideas of Matheson and others, Robinson suggests the emergence \nof a post-modern form of journalism, which is more \u201enonlinear and interactive\u201f, and \ninvolve breaking the boundaries of conventional news reporting through things like \nfirst person narration, contradictions, speculation and so on (Robinson, 2006, p. 78).  \nHowever, Robinson (2006) saw these developments within mainstream media outlets \nas a kind of \u201ecorporate answer\u201f to independent blogs and as a \u201eway for journalists to \nreclaim journalism\u201f standards (p.79).  Like Singer then, Robinson saw mainstream \nmedia j-blogs as a kind of appropriation and normalising of the potential of blogs \nwithin conventional journalism.  For instance, j-blogs in the study were found to \nattempt \u201enews repair\u201f through criticising non-journalists\u201f blogs (Robinson, 2006, p. \n80).  So, whilst differences and developments are evident in j-blogs, these are very \nmuch \u201eframed in tradition\u201f (Robinson, 2006, p. 81). \nAn emergent view is that blogs may not offer \u201epure\u201f news but they have an \nimportant role to play in assisting news consumers to organise, interpret and make \nsense of the growing volumes of news that the internet has facilitated. This objective \nis being achieved by opening up opportunities for news consumer to engage more \ndirectly with traditional news producers and to join the latter if not as bona fide news \nproducers to have to chance to respond directly and publicly to the news from \nprofessionals and to serve as news fact checkers. The most influential bloggers are \nthose who have, among other things, established a reputation for being helpful in \nthese respects. Such developments underline a sea change in journalism whereby \njournalists not longer have sovereignty over content creation (see MacKinnon, 2005). \nInstead, blogs have created a new public discourse around news that has opened up \nthe formation and framing of news reports to a wider constituency that now has the \npower to change news.           \n 32 \nReferences \nAbdulla, R.
