Introduction\nIn the last decades both civil and military aircraft have been operated at service lives\nwell beyond their original design life. Due to military budgetary constraints and civilian \nindustry requirements, all of these older aircraft either have encountered ageing \nproblems, such as fatigue cracking, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) or corrosion \uf05b1, 2\uf05d. \nFatigue cracks often initiate from impact damage occurring during pre-flight and taxiing \noperations, dropped tools during maintenance, runaway debris, hail or bird strike \uf05b3, 4\uf05d. \nSuch damaged structures are frequently required to remain i  service for extended \nperiods, despite the occurrence of damage. In design of new aircraft structures, lower \ndensity and higher operational stress levels are often required to achieve the desired \nweight. Use of welding [5] can give economy of construction. However, both use of \nhigh strength materials and of integral welded structures make achievement of fail\nsafety and damage tolerance difficult. Regulators can penalise such structures by \nimposition of extra design safety factors. Airworthiness regulations require the damage \ntolerance and fail safe philosophy to be adopted \uf05b6, 7\uf05d. For such reasons, the use of \ncrack retarder devices to stop or limit fatigue crack growth is a possibility to improve \nfail safety and damage tolerance. In aircraft repair, mechanically fastened metallic \nreinforcements with either bolts or rivets have been used successfully for many years. \nHowever, they introduce additional stress concentrations into the damaged area. Holes \nmust be drilled for mechanical fasteners and may also damage internal components \nduring the repair. Use of bonded repairs and crack retardation methods may be the \neasiest and cheapest solution to overcome these problems. Use of adhesively bonded \nPage 3 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nrepair with either metal or composites patches on 2024-T3 has received a lot of attention\n\uf05b8, 9\uf05d. Disadvantages include material compatibility problems. Boron\/epoxy and \ncarbon\/epoxy have lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than aluminium, thus \ncausing residual stresses in the repair. Moreover, the presence of graphite could create \ngalvanic corrosion problems. As a consequence of these problems, other patch\nmaterials, such as titanium or fibre-metal laminates (FML) such as GLARE have been \ninvestigated, showing their effectiveness in retarding or arresting the crack \uf05b10, 11\uf05d.\nFMLs combine good fatigue performance with the excellent impact resistance \uf05b2, 12-\n20\uf05d. The use of FMLs as crack retarders may help to improve the damage tolerance of \nstructures and a number of recent papers have demonstrated the benefits of following \nthis approach, e.g. \uf05b21\uf05d. Schijve \uf05b22\uf05d showed that thin straps of aramid reinforced \naluminium laminate (ARALL) bonded to aluminium panels are effective as crack \nstoppers in thin structures. The effect of the crack retarder on crack growth rate could be\nquantified using the global stiffness ratio \uf06d, defined as:\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n\uf02b\uf03d StrapStrapAlAl\nStrapStrap\nAEAE\nAE\uf06d (1)\nwhere EStrap, EAl and AStrap, AAl correspond to the elastic modulus and cross section areas \nof the strap and aluminium substrate, respectively. Heinimann et al. \uf05b23, 24\uf05d\ninvestigated GLARE bonded to AA7085-T7651 plates and showed that crack growth \nlife can be improved by a factor of 2 to 4. Zhang et al [25, 26, 27] noted that in addition \nto the stiffness ratio \u03bc, the effects of the strap are a function of  residual stresses arising \nin the strap bonding process and out of plane bending caused by the single sided strap \napplication.    Although the impact resistance and damage tolerance of FMLs have been \nPage 4 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nextensively investigated over the years, there is limited published work on post-impact \nfatigue response of bonded retarders \uf05b28-31\uf05d. \nThe work reported in this paper investigates the effect of impact damage on crack \nretardation performance of GLARE 1 straps bonded to a 5 mm thick aluminium \nsubstrate. The impacts were made to the substrate on the opposite side to the bonded \nlayer. The effects of the impact on damage in the GLARE and in the adhesively bonded \nlayer were determined, along with the post impact performance of the bonded strap as a \ncrack retarder.\n2. Experimental procedure\n2.1. Materials and test configurations\nThe aluminium alloy 7085-T7651 was chosen as the substrate. Table 1 summarises the \n7085 tensile strength properties [32]. Fig. 1 shows the substrate microstructure viewed \nalong the three principal directions. The substrate was 5 mm thick. GLARE 1-3\/2 was \nchosen as the crack retarder strap material. GLARE 1-3\/2 consists of three layers of \n7475-T761 aluminium alloy and two layers of 0\u00b0\/0\u00b0 glass-reinforced epoxy pre-preg. It\nwas 1.78 mm thick. In Table 2 the tensile properties of the GLARE 3\/2 are listed [31].\nFig. 2 shows the transverse-cross section view of the GLARE material. FM\uf0e2 94 \nmodified epoxy adhesive film, supplied by Cytec, was chosen to bond the GLARE to \nthe substrate. This is the same adhesive as used to bond the aluminium and glass fibre \nlayers of the GLARE together. Details of the mechanical performance can be found at \n[33]. The specimen configurations used for this study are shown in Figures 3 and 4. For \nimpact tests (Fig. 3) the GLARE (115 \u00d7 65 mm \u00d7 1.78 mm thick) was bonded in the \nmiddle of rectangular plates (150 \u00d7 100 mm \u00d7 5 mm thick). For the fatigue crack \nPage 5 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\ngrowth tests (Fig. 4) the straps (200 \u00d7 25 mm \u00d7 1.78 mm thick) were bonded to single \nedge notch tensile (SENT) aluminium plates (400 \u00d7 140 mm \u00d7 5 mm thick). The edge \nof the GLARE strap was  20 mm from the notch tip (37 mm from the SENT plate edge).\nThe global stiffness ratio of the fatigue samples as calculated using equation 1 was \n0.056. The surface of the substrate was etched with a sulphuric acid\/sodium dichromate \nbath held at 60\u00b0C prior to applying the adhesive. The specimens were bonded following \nmanufacturers instructions and cured 1 hour at 125 \uf0b0C. After cure the specimens were\ninspected using an ultrasonic phased array C-scan to confirm their bond quality prior to \nimpact and fatigue tests. The hot cure process will introduce tensile residual stresses \n[26] into the substrate; modifying the changes in crack growth rate in all the samples\nidentically.\n2.2. Mechanical Test methods\nImpact tests were performed with an instrumented falling\u2013weight machine fitted with a \nsecond strike preventer. The specimens were clamped within a steel frame having a \nrectangular aperture and struck at the centre of the aluminium substrate by a \nhemispherical tup 20 mm in diameter. The total mass of the impactor was 2.54 kg. A \nrange of impact energies between 10 - 50 J were achieved by changing the drop height. \nFour specimens were tested at each energy level. After impact specimens were scanned \nultrasonically using a phased array probe located on the substrate side to assess the \nextent of damage sustained to the interface and to the GLARE. Samples were then \nsectioned through the mid plane of the impact, polished and finally examined by \nmetallographic microscopy and SEM to observe the damage patterns and failure \nmechanisms. \nPage 6 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\nFatigue crack growth tests were performed on a 250 kN servo hydraulic machine \nequipped with digital control. Specimens were subjected to fatigue loading at 8 Hz and \nR ratio of 0.1. The starting load range of 46.75 kN, was progressively reduced so that as \nthe crack tip encountered the edge of the strap, the nominal \uf044K was 10 MPa\uf0d6m. Once \nthis condition was reached, the loads were kept constant until the tests finished. Two \nfatigue specimens were impacted before fatigue testing using the procedure previously \ndescribed. They were struck on the substrate so that an indentation opposite the middle \nof the strap was produced. A further specimen was tested without prior impact. Fatigue \ncrack growth rates were compared with those produced in a 7085 sample tested without \na bonded GLARE strap. Crack lengths were measured  using a travelling microscope to \ncalibrate an electrical potential crack length measurement system. The accuracy of crack \nlength measurement was \u00b1 0.2 mm. Delamination damage produced by impacts and by \nfatigue crack growth was measured using an ultrasonic phased array C scan applied to \nthe substrate side of the sample. After testing samples were examined in the SEM.\n3. Results\n3.1. Impact behaviour\nThe response to the impact is described in terms of force-time curves produced by \ndifferent impact energies (Fig. 5). Peak forces during impact ranged from 10 kN for 10 J\nimpacts to about 25 kN in the case of the specimens impacted at 50 J. All the curves \nshow pronounced oscillations throughout and, unlike the corresponding curves for \npolymer matrix composites, do not exhibit any sudden load drops. Each load transient \nwas less than 2 ms in duration. The period of oscillation in each test was  0.2 ms,\nindependent of the impact energy. The maxima and minima of each oscillation occurred \nPage 7 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nat approximately the same time, as indicated by the arrow markers in Figure 5. The \nmaximum force occurred at the same time after impact (0.8 ms) for all impact energies.\nFig. 6 shows a graph of the maximum force obtained from the force\u2013time curves versus\nthe impact energy. Over the range of energies studied, the trend is linear. \n3.1.1. Impact damage- visual observations on the external surface\nThe impact produced an approximately circular indentation on the substrate outer \nsurface (see Fig. 7). On the GLARE side of the sample the external surfa e developed a \nlocal bulge opposite the impact site; it was roughly elliptical shape with the long axis \noriented along the glass reinforcement direction. The dent and bulge areas were \nmeasured using an optical microscope. Table 3 shows the optically detectable damage \nareas produced on the substrate and on the GLARE sides of the sample. Surface damage \non both sides increases with increasing impact energy. For the greatest impact energies, \nthe bulge area produced on the GLARE side is approximately 5 times greater than the \ndent area on the substrate. C-scan measurements revealed that the damaged areas in \nGLARE had a roughly elliptical shape as shown in Fig. 8. Figure 9 shows a plot of the \nimpact damage area as measured using ultrasound and shows that the damage area  \nincreases with increasing impact energy, reaching 800 mm2 after 50 J impact. This is \nalmost a factor of 10 times greater than the damage area visually detectable listed in \nTable 3.\n3.1.2 Impact damage- observations on sections through the impacts \nFor all specimens fibre failure and matrix cracking were found in the two glass layers \nwithin the GLARE. Figures 10 and 11 show examples of fibre fracture and matrix \nPage 8 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\ncracking within the glass layer furthest from the substrate. For a 50 J impact, the \npercentage of fibres cracked was about 60% of the total in the first glass layer, and\nabout 90% in the second layer. Cracks occurred both along and through the fibre. The \nmatrix cracks were not located directly beneath the impact area, but  started towards the \nedges of the damage. Fibre cracking was observed transverse, longitudinal and at 45\u00b0\nwith respect to the fibre axis, as shown in Fig. 12. No delaminations were found at the \naluminium\/epoxy interfaces within the GLARE. No delaminations were found at the \ninterface between the substrate and the outer GLARE aluminium layer. All damage \nappeared to be confined to the glass layers within the GLARE laminate.\n3.2. Fatigue crack growth tests\nFigure 13 shows crack growth rates plotted against crack length for a sample with a \nbonded strap compared with growth rates from the substrate alone. Maximum \nretardation effect is found at the first strap edge where there is a reduction in growth rate \nof a factor of 5 for the unimpacted specimen. In addition, there appears to be a reduction \nin growth rate in the zone before the crack tip had reached the strap edge. While the \ncrack tip was under the strap further reductions in growth rate occurred. As the crack tip  \npassed the second strap edge the growth rates were about a factor of 2 less than those \nfound in the substrate alone. Fig. 14 shows plots of crack length vs. cycles for \nunimpacted samples and for samples impacted at 10 J and 30 J. Before the first strap \nedge is approached, the behaviour of the samples are similar. Once the strap edge is \nreached behaviour differences are observed. In particular, the unimpacted specimen \nshows a longer fatigue life than the impacted specimens. The specimen impacted at 30 J \nhas the shortest crack growth life, with a reduction in fatigue life of about 30.5%\nPage 9 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\ncompared with the unimpacted one. For the specimen impacted at 10 J the reduction is \nabout 12.5%.\n3.2.1. Delamination development in fatigue\nWhen the substrate fatigue crack encountered the strap edge, it did not propagate \nthrough the GLARE but instead promoted a delamination between the outer aluminium \nlamina bonded to the substrate and the first glass layer within the GLARE. This was \nobserved in all fatigue specimens. The extent of this delamination was measured by \nultrasonic phased array C scan. Figure 15 shows the increase in delamination area \nproduced as the substrate crack length increases. A small delamination developed as the \ncrack tip approached the strap edge, this increased markedly when the crack tip tunneled \nunder the strap and  continued to increase in size as the crack tip moved beyond the \nstrap.\n3.2.2. Fracture surface observations\nThe fatigue fracture surface of the unimpacted specimen is shown in Fig. 16. The \nsubstrate fatigue fracture propagated into the first aluminium layer of the GLARE, \nfracturing that completely. The main delamination propagated between the first \naluminium layer and the first grp layer within the GLARE, separating the aluminium \nfrom the rest of the GLARE. A subsidiary delamination  developed between the \nsubstrate and the FM94 adhesive bonding the outer GLARE layer to the substrate. This\nis visible in Fig. 17.\n4. Discussion\nPage 10 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\n4.1. Impact behaviour\nLoad changes during impacts on polymer composite materials \uf05b34\uf05d and FMLs \uf05b35, 36\uf05d\ncan be characterised by an initial rise in load to a maximum value of load followed by a \nsudden sharp drop in the load, indicating the presence of failure, such as a delamination \n[35] or a puncture related to a full penetration. This point represents the damage \ninitiation threshold force. After puncture the impact energy is not fully recovered as for \nan elastic event but it is almost all converted to deformation, internal damage and \ncracking. Lower frequency oscillations observed on the load \u2013 time traces in this work \nare mainly derived from dynamic resonances and vibrations. For the specimens studied \nhere, obvious load drops did not occur. Rather for each impact energy tested only minor\ndrops were observed. They could not be distinguished from the dynamic oscillations. It \nwas observed in the sectioning & microscopy studies that fibre failure and matrix \ncracking occurred after impact. Any loading discontinuities associated with their \nformation may have been obscured by the size of the transient oscillations. The contact \nperiod of (1.5 ms) of each impact was found to be in agreement with that observed in \ntests on similar laminates, such as ARALL \uf05b18, 19\uf05d, carbon fibre and GLARE 3-2\/1 \n\uf05b37\uf05d, when impacted in the range 1.7 J\u201352 J. The maximum force obtained here was \ngreater than previously observed by a factor two. This may be a consequence of the \nlarge (5 mm) thickness and consequent rigidity of the substrate.\nIt is important to note that C-scanning studies (Fig. 9) show that damage was formed \neven after 10 J and 20 J impacts and that the internal damage extended further than the \nsize of the visible dent (Table 3). Similar behaviour was observed by Wu in testing \nGLARE 5-2\/1 and GLARE 4-3\/2 laminates when directly impacted in the range 7\u201340 J\n\uf05b31\uf05d and after chemically removing the outer aluminium layers. In this research, \nPage 11 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nsignificant delaminations between the non impacted aluminium layer and the glass \nlayer, together with a plastic deformation around the point of the impact, were observed. \nIn addition, cracking of the fibre and matrix were found. Fibre failure and matrix \ncracking were found after impact in all of the specimens tested in this study. Figures 10-\n12 also reveal matrix cracking is not located directly beneath the impacted area, but \ninstead started from the edges of the damage area. This behaviour is consistent with the \nobservation in the typical polymer matrix composite when impacted at a low velocity \n\uf05b38-40\uf05d. \n4.2. Fatigue behaviour\nThe application of the thin strap of GLARE 1-3\/2 shows benefit to fatigue life and to \ncrack propagation resistance of up to a factor of 5. Similar behaviour was found by \nHeinimann et al. \uf05b23\uf05d in testing 2.29 mm thick 6013-T6 and 6.35 mm 7085-T7651 \npanels reinforced with such laminate, and by Zhang et al. [25-27] in fatiguing 7085-\nT7651 reinforced with a variety of bonded straps. There are a number of reasons for this \nbehaviour. There is modification of the local substrate stress due to the strap taking \nsome of the applied load away from the substrate. In addition, the presence of the strap \nreduces the effective stress intensity factor at the crack tip due to the bridging effect \nwhen the crack propagates through and past the strap. The stiffness and geometry of \nboth the strap and the substrate, i.e. stiffness ratio also affects the fatigue behaviour \n\uf05b22\uf05d, and these parameters produce a reduction of the growth rate when the crack tip is \nunder and beyond the strap. When the crack tip first encounters the strap edge and \npropagates under it, a delamination develops at the interface between the strap and the \nsubstrate, thus reducing the stiffness ratio and effectiveness of crack bridging. Therefore\nPage 12 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\ndelamination crack growth will gradually reduce effectiveness of the strap. The \nadhesive cure temperature cycle is responsible for creation of tensile residual stresses in \nthe substrate [25-27]; these will counter the beneficial effects of the strap \uf05b25, 26, 41\uf05d. \nIn the case of this work it was observed that the major delamination occurred within the \nGLARE rather than between the outer layer of the GLARE and the substrate, the outer \naluminium layer of the GLARE being severed via fatigue crack growth.\nIntroduction of impact damage in GLARE due to substrate impact caused a reduction in \nfatigue life and increased crack growth rate. These effects are believed to be because the \nstrap stiffness will be reduced by the fractured glass fibres. The sample stiffness ratio\nwill hence also be reduced. In addition, the impacted strap could have produced an \nincreased stress intensity factor via reduced load transfer from the substrate to the strap \n\uf05b42\uf05d, caused again by a reduction in the GLARE stiffness. \nAll the specimens tested in fatigue showed the same trend failure mode behaviour. In \nparticular, the substrate crack cut through the FM94 adhesive and the outer aluminium \nlayer of GLARE as a Mode I fatigue crack, the major delamination developing at the \nfirst glass fibre\/epoxy layer of GLARE. A secondary delamination could be seen at the \nsubstrate\/ FM94 interface as shown in Figure 17, but this did not cause the failure of the \nstrap and was evidently propagating slower than the delamination within the GLARE.\nDelamination occurring on the latter interface could explain the fluctuations found in \nthe measured fatigue crack growth rates. As other GLARE interfaces do not contribute \nto the delamination process, the crack bridging process occurring when the crack tip is \nbeyond the strap was controlled in part by the properties of the first aluminium\/glass \nfibre interface, as well as by strap stiffness. Increasing the delamination resistance of \nany other interface will not improve retardation behaviour further.\nPage 13 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\n5. Conclusions\n1. Impacts on the aluminium substrate of bonded GLARE aluminium hybrids with \nenergies between 10 J - 50 J, results in significant internal damage to both glass layers \nin the GLARE . The damage consists of fibre fractures splintering and matrix cracking.\n2. No delamination between the substrate and GLARE was detected after impact, even \nat the highest energy levels. There was none at the interface between the aluminium and \nadhesive within the GLARE. Damage to the GRP could be detected even at the smallest \nimpact energy of 10 J. \n3. In fatiguing unimpacted bonded GLARE reductions in crack growth rate up to a \nfactor of 5 were observed. After the impact, the retardation effect was a factor of 2. \nAcknowledgements \nThanks are due to the Italian Air Force for making financially possible the attending of \nthe MSc Advanced Materials at the Cranfield University (UK), Alcoa for AA 7085 and \nGTM for the GLARE.\nReferences\n\uf05b1\uf05d Committee on Aging of US Airforce Aircraft, \u201cAging of US aircraft\u201d, National \nMaterials Advisory Board,  Publication NMAB-488-2, National Academy Press, \nWashington DC 1997.\n\uf05b2\uf05d L.
