Injection commenced at Sleipner \nin 1996 with CO2 separated from natural gas being injected into the Utsira Sand, a \nmajor saline aquifer of late Cenozoic age. CO2 injection is via a near-horizontal well, \nat a depth of about 1012 m bsl, some 200 m below the reservoir top, at a rate \napproaching 1 million tonnes (Mt) per year, with more than 11 Mt currently stored.  \n \nA comprehensive time-lapse surface seismic programme has been carried out, with \n3D surveys in 1994, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. Key aims of the seismic \nmonitoring are to track plume migration, demonstrate containment within the storage \nreservoir and provide quantitative information as a means to better understand \ndetailed flow processes controlling development of the plume in the reservoir. \n \nThe CO2 plume is imaged as a number of bright sub-horizontal reflections within the \nreservoir, growing with time (Figure 1). The reflections mostly comprise tuned \nwavelets arising from thin (mostly < 8 m thick) layers of CO2 trapped beneath very \nthin intra-reservoir mudstones and the reservoir caprock. The plume is roughly 200 m \nhigh and elliptical in plan, with a major axis increasing to over 3000 m by 2008. As \nwell as its prominent reflectivity, the plume also produces a large velocity pushdown \ncaused by the seismic waves travelling more slowly through CO2-saturated rock than \nthrough the virgin aquifer. \n \nThis paper summarises some of the quantitative methods that have been applied to the \nSleipner seismic datasets.  \n \n \n2  \n \nFigure 1. Time-lapse seismic images of the Sleipner CO2 plume. North \u2013 south inline \nthrough the plume (top); plan view of total reflection amplitude in the plume (bottom). \n \nQuantitative interpretation. Quantitative verification of the whole plume is not a \nregulatory requirement for CO2 storage, but is an interesting technical challenge \nnonetheless. Early interpretive work on reflection amplitudes and velocity pushdown \nderived a 3D saturation model for the 1999 dataset which contained around 85% of \nthe known injected CO2 whilst maintaining a satisfactory match with the seismic data \n(Chadwick et al., 2005). Flow simulations suggest around 10 % of the free CO2 would \nhave dissolved into the aqueous phase (thereby becoming seismically invisible), so \nthis may be considered a satisfactory result. The more recent Sleipner datasets are \nbecoming more difficult to quantify in their entirety, as with time, reflectivity in the \ndeeper plume is fading and velocity pushdown is becoming more difficult to map \n(Figure 1). This may signify real and significant changes in CO2 distribution in the \ndeeper part of the plume or, alternatively, may arise from seismic imaging effects \narising from generally increasing CO2 saturations within the plume envelope.  \n \nA general tendency of CO2 to progressively accumulate in the upper part of the \nreservoir is evident (Figure 1). The topmost layer of the plume is particularly clearly \nimaged, mappable via its strong reflectivity (Figure 2 left). CO2 first reached the \nreservoir top in 1999, growing to an accumulation of considerable lateral extent by \n2001 and continuing to expand thereafter. Lateral migration was strongly controlled \nby the top reservoir topography, exemplified by a north-trending linear finger of CO2 \nmigrating along a narrow sedimentary ridge in the basal topseal surface (Figure 2 \ncentre).  \n \n \nFigure 2. The topmost CO2 layer in the Sleipner plume. Left: Map of seismic \namplitudes in 2006. Centre: 3D view (looking north) of the top Utsira Sand surface \n(mapped on the baseline 1994 dataset) showing the CO2 - water contacts in 2001 \n(red), 2004 (purple and 2006 (blue). Right: Topmost layer thicknesses in 2006, \nderived from structural analysis. \n \nEarlier quantitative work has utilised the relationship of reflection amplitude to CO2 \nlayer thickness. An alternative way of estimating the thickness of the topmost CO2 \n3  \nlayer is by topographic analysis of the reservoir top (Figure 2 centre), the outer limit \nof CO2 reflectivity at this level corresponding to the CO2 - water contact (CWC). \nAssuming the layer to be ponded buoyantly beneath the topseal, the form of the fluid \ncontact at its base was constructed by fitting a smooth subhorizontal surface through \nthe elevations of the CWC (the surface is not perfectly horizontal because it is \nconstructed in two-way time, not depth and also because of significant fluid dynamic \neffects). The two-way time thickness of the topmost layer was then calculated by \nsubtracting the elevations of the reservoir top from the corresponding elevations of the \nCWC. These were then converted to depth thicknesses by assuming an appropriate \nvelocity model for the overburden (Figure 2 right). Uncertainty in these structurally-\nderived thicknesses relate mainly to uncertainties in overburden velocities, but it is \nalso clear that layer reflectivity extends into areas where the structurally-derived layer \ndoes not, most notably south of the injection point (Figure 2). This is because the \nstructural analysis does not allow CO2 to be present wherever the constructed CWC is \nshallower than the topseal. In reality the CO2 layer is a dynamic entity with significant \nhorizontal flow and likely supplied from below by a number of feeders, some of \nwhich may lie beneath topographically \u2018overdeepened\u2019 areas in the topseal. \n \nThe saturation of CO2 within the topmost layer can be estimated using measured \ncapillary pressures for the Utsira Sand, and from this CO2 volumes within the layer \ncan be calculated. Based on these volumes, flow simulations of layer growth have \nbeen history-matched against the observations and understanding of flow processes \nwithin the reservoir has been improved (e.g. Chadwick et al. 2009). \n \nModel-based inversion. Stratigraphic inversion is used to better characterize \nreservoirs by integrating various kinds of information obtained at different scales, \ncombining geological (e.g. well-log and sedimentological data) and geophysical \ninformation (e.g. vertical seismic profiles, picked seismic horizons) in a target-\noriented inversion process.  \n \nA post-stack stratigraphic inversion of the 1994 and 2006 datasets was used to obtain \nacoustic (P-wave) impedances for the Sleipner plume (Del\u00e9pine et al., 2009). Pre-\nstack inversion allows derivation of a more complete elastic model, parameterized by \nboth P- and S-wave impedances. Elastic properties are important for subsurface \ncharacterization as they can be used in favourable cases to determine additional \npetrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability. \n \nWe present here results obtained from a model-based pre-stack inversion applied to \nthe 1994 (baseline) and to the 2006 (after injection of 8.4 Mt of CO2) time-lapse \nseismic datasets. The pre-stack data considered in our inversion fall into three angle \nclasses built from  partial stacks according to incidence angle: \"near\" (6\u00b0 to 16\u00b0),  \n\"mid\" (17\u00b0 to 27\u00b0) and \"far\" (28\u00b0 to 38\u00b0).  The pre-stack inversion methodology \ncomprises three steps: \n \nWell-to-seismic calibration. This step aims to find optimal wavelets which ensure \nconsistency between well log data and surface seismic data through the Aki and \nRichards approximation. For each vintage three optimal wavelets were derived, one \nfor each angle class, to compensate for issues in pre-processing and to correct for \npropagation effects in the overburden.   \n \n4  \nA priori model building. Pre-stack stratigraphic inversion requires an a priori multi-\nparameter elastic model parameterized as P- and S-wave impedances. Interpreted \nhorizons picked from the seismic data were used to define the structural and \nstratigraphical framework (Figure 3). Within each unit sedimentological constraints \nwere used to compute correlation surfaces. Calibrated elastic impedance and density \nlog information was then integrated into the model by extrapolation along the \ncorrelation surfaces. \n \nFigure 3. P-wave and S-wave optimal impedances obtained after pre-stack inversion \nof the 2006 vintage (crossed planes: XL1097, IL1880 and time slice: t=1052 ms), \nshowing the picked top and base Utsira Sand. The impedance log derived from \nexploration well 15\/9-13 is shown for comparison (right). Vertical distributions of \nacoustic impedance obtained at a selected crossline XL1145 (left). \n \nJoint pre-stack stratigraphic inversion of all angle classes. The pre-stack \nstratigraphic inversion algorithm described by Tonellot et al. (2001) was applied to a \n750-1400 ms time window. Strong weighting was given to the a priori information, \nby stipulating high correlation length values, because the geological layers are \nrelatively flat and there is only weak lateral variation of impedance outside of the CO2 \nplume. Results after 50 iterations show the optimised 3D distribution of P- and S-\nwave impedances (Figure 3). Impedances inferred from the nearby well 15\/9-13 show \ngood correlation with the cross-section along XL1097. The optimised P- and S-wave \nimpedance model was used to compute synthetic seismic data for each angle class \n(Figure 4). For the section along inline IL1850, a good fit is observed between real \nand synthetic data for both the near and far angle classes in terms of amplitude and \nwaveform in the middle of the plot (on both sides of the red line). \n \n5  \n \nFigure 4. Comparison between observed and synthetic data computed after pre-stack \ninversion of the 2006 vintage: vertical slice at inline position IL1850 for the \"near\" \nangle and \u201cfar\u201d angle partial stacks. \n \n \nDiscusson of results. Within the impedance cube on XL1145 (Figure 3), the CO2 \nplume is seen clearly as a strong reduction in P-wave impedances, locally to less than \n2500 m.s-1.g.cm-3 , compared with around 4000 m.s-1.g.cm-3 in the virgin aquifer. \nRock physics analysis on an Utsira Sand model containing CO2 at medium to high \nsaturations gives P-wave impedances similar to those calculated for the upper part of \nthe CO2 plume (Figure 3). However, determination of unique CO2 saturations from \nimpedance values remains very challenging. \n \nWell logs reveal several thin mudstones within the Utsira Sand. The thickest of these, \nlocated just below the top of the reservoir, has a thickness of 5 m or more and is \nvisible on the impedance displays (Figure 3). The other intra-reservoir mudstones are \nbelow seismic resolution, but they can be delineated if the two following conditions \nare met: they are illuminated by CO2 trapped beneath them, or their separation in \ndepth is large enough relative to the dominant wavelength of the seismic data. Thus \nwe also observe a mudstone layer at around 940 ms on the P-wave impedance display \nwhich overlies a significant accumulation of trapped CO2.  \n \nThe time-lapse seismic data show a progressive attenuation of seismic events beneath \nthe CO2 plume which increases with time (Figure 1). Attenuation of a strong \nreflection at around 1300 ms was noted by Clochard et al. (2009). This effect is \nreduced on the P-wave impedances result (Figure 3 left) because the inversion process \nis a trade-off between the seismic data and a priori geological knowledge. Indeed, the \ninversion of P-wave seismic data alone is unable to fully recover the S-wave \nimpedance, so the process gives more weight to the a priori S-wave model resulting \nin S-wave impedances with very little attenuation. \n \nThe pre-stack inversion results were compared to those of post-stack inversion \n(Clochard et al. 2009). The pre-stack inversion seems better able to characterize some \nparts of the reservoir, particularly the sand unit between the reservoir top and the \nuppermost intra-reservoir mudstone. In the 1994 pre-stack inversion, the average \nseismic bandwidths of the \u201cnear\u201d, \u201cmid\u201d and \u201cfar\u201d angle classes are: 14-64 Hz, 15-61 \n6  \nHz and 13-56 Hz, respectively at -6 dB. In the post-stack case the average seismic \nbandwidth is 14-59 Hz. In addition, the pre-stack inversion process combines the long \nwavelengths of the seismic impedances (derived from well log data and stacking \nvelocities) with seismic data sorted according to angle classes. It thus covers a \nfrequency bandwidth from 0 to 64 Hz, with resolution superior to that obtained by \npost-stack inversion. \n \nAncillary quantitative tools. A number of quantitative methods do not in themselves \naddress analysis of the whole plume, but can provide valuable ancillary information in \nunderstanding and quantifying CO2 distributions. \n \nSpectral decomposition. Frequency tuning of the seismic wavelet can be used to \nextract layer thicknesses from seismic data. To do this for an individual CO2 layer \nhowever, requires a very short analysis window. To this end, spectral decomposition \nalgorithms incorporating the quadratic Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and the \nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) have been developed. After rigorous testing \non synthetic data, the algorithms are being applied to the Sleipner datasets, \nconcentrating on the topmost layer of CO2. An east-west cross-section shows strong \nfrequency tuning in the tongue of CO2 trapped beneath the north-south trending ridge \nin the topseal (Figure 5). The CO2 layer beneath the axial part of the ridge shows \ntuning at about 35 Hz, whereas the beneath the flanks it tunes at about 65 Hz and \npossibly up to 75Hz. These frequencies correspond to temporal layer thickness from \nabout 15 ms beneath the ridge crest to around 6 ms on the flanks.  Combining these \nfigures with independent constraints on the true thickness of this layer (see above) \nsuggest layer velocities in the range 1200 to 1500 ms-1, consistent with rock physics \nestimations. Work is in progress to further quantify CO2 layer thicknesses and \nvelocities in this layer. \n7  \n \nFigure 5. Frequency tuning on the topmost CO2 layer in the Sleipner plume.  \n \nAVO analysis. Constrained AVO analysis is being used to estimate the thickness of \nthe CO2 layers.  This is non-trivial because the CO2 collects in thin layers of variable \nsaturation, beneath mudstone beds that are between one and a few metres thick.  \nConventional AVO methods, using linear approximations to the Zoeppritz Equation, \nfail when applied to thin layer reflections due to interference between reflections \nwithin the layer.  Here, we obtain AVO reference curves R(\u03b8) by using reflectivity \nmodelling which takes into account these interference effects. Optimal basis functions \n(f1, f2\u2026) are obtained from the reference curves using a singular value decomposition, \nwhich results in the linear approximation: \n \n1 1 2 2( ) ( ) ( ) ...R C f C f\uf071 \uf071 \uf071\uf0bb \uf02b \uf02b  \n                                    \nwhere C1 and C2 are coefficients parameterising the equation (Causse et al., 2007).  \nCross-plots of these coefficients can potentially be used for classification and \ndetermination of layer thickness, as will be shown below, provided different classes of \nreflector show sufficient separation. \n \nReflectivity modelling requires knowledge of seismic velocities, densities, and layer \nthicknesses and the modelled reference curves need to cover the range of variability in \nthe reservoir.  The ranges in the properties of the mudstone and brine saturated sand \nlayers were obtained from well logs. Properties with CO2 present were calculated \nusing an equation-of-state and different rock physics relations for different types of \n8  \nfluid mixing (uniform to patchy).  Uncertainties in measurements of pressure and \ntemperature are accounted for by choosing values from a normal distribution. \n \nSaturation profiles for the CO2 layers, calculated from capillary pressure data, show \nvariable CO2 saturations with depth. In the reflectivity modelling this is approximated \nas multiple thin layers, each with a constant saturation. \n \nFigure 6 shows a sample set of reference curves for different CO2 layer thicknesses. \nFor each assumed CO2 layer thickness all other parameters are varied randomly \nwithin ranges reasonable for Sleipner. As the CO2 layer thickness increases, the \nreflection coefficients first become more negative, with a minimum value at a \nthickness of 7.5 m, similar to the tuning thickness from Chadwick et al. (2005).  Then, \nthey become more positive again and therefore overlap with the coefficients of some \nof the thinner layers.  \n \n \nFigure 6. Top:  Reference AVO curves for varying thicknesses (colour-coded) of a \nCO2 layer beneath a 5-m thick shale layer. Bottom: Cross-plot of coefficients C1 and \nC2 of the basis functions describing the reference curves in (a).  \n \nFigure 6 shows the cross-plot of C1 and C2 for these reference curves. The coefficients \nof the 2.5-m and 7-m thick layers are clearly separate from each other and from the \nother thicknesses, and can thus be used as a classification criterion. The other \ncoefficients plot in close proximity to each other and classification is more difficult.  \nFor thicknesses above 12.5 m, the coefficients barely change and plot on top of each \n9  \nother.  Provided that estimated velocities, densities and overlying layer thicknesses are \nsufficiently precise, we would expect that C1 and C2 obtained from real data fall on \nthe modelled values. However, due to the non-uniqueness of the modelled \ncoefficients, classification would be limited, particularly for thicknesses larger than \nthe tuning thickness.  Work to obtain better estimates of parameters and to classify \nreal data from the Sleipner plume is ongoing. \n \nExtrema signal classification. The flow of CO2 within the Utsira Sand is mostly \nbuoyancy driven and as observed on the time lapse seismic, several thin intra-\nreservoir mudstones significantly retard the migration of CO2 towards the reservoir \ntop. In order to improve the predictive qualities of reservoir flow models, it is \nimportant to map the geometry of these mudstones as accurately as possible. This is a \nchallenging task, because well-logs show that the mudstones are generally not much \nmore than a metre thick and thus hardly seismically detectable.  \n \nUp to now, in the absence of better constraints, geological models of the Utsira Sand \nhave assumed that the deeper mudstone layers are structurally conformable with the \nbase of the shallowest intra-reservoir mudstone, which at more than 5m thick, is \nseismically detectable. This is clearly a simplification, so renewed effort is being \nmade to detect and map the intra-reservoir mudstones by applying a technology called \nextrema classification (Borgos et al. 2003). Data preconditioning comprised multiple \nremoval by predictive deconvolution, followed by a noise reduction scheme that \nsmoothed the seismic signal along the reflectors, while preserving stronger \ndiscontinuities that might correspond to faults. Extrema classification applied to the \n1994 (baseline) dataset was used to generate horizon patches for all events (peaks and \ntroughs). Horizon patches characterized by similar seismic waveform attributes at the \nextrema were then aggregated into fully interpreted horizons. These horizons are \ntentatively inferred to correspond to the thin intra-reservoir mudstones.  \n \n \n \n10  \nFigure 7. Left: Map view of a new intra-reservoir horizon interpreted from extrema \nanalysis of the 1994 baseline dataset ( depth contours in black with colourscale). \nSuperimposed are the outline of the 2001 (light blue) and 2006 (red) CO2 layers \nponding beneath this surface. Right: The corresponding surface with a topography \nwhich is conformable with the shallowest intra-reservoir  mudstone. \n \n \nA horizon interpreted by extrema classification is shown in map view (Figure 7). \nSuperimposed on this are the limits of the CO2 layer trapped beneath the horizon for \nthe 2001 and 2006 surveys. It is clear that development of the CO2 layer broadly \nfollows the topography of the horizon. The mapping match is not perfect suggesting \nthat layer spreading may also influenced by other factors such as variable \npermeability or porosity. Yet, it seems clear that the new horizon interpretation gives \na better result than mere translation of the topography of the shallowest intra-reservoir \nmudstone. It is hoped that more intra-reservoir horizons can be detected and mapped \nin this way and may perhaps contribute to improved reservoir flow modelling.   \n \nThe path forward. Quantitative analysis of the time-lapse seismic at Sleipner is \nongoing. The prevalent thin-layer (tuned) reflectivity renders conventional application \nof techniques such as AVO and trace inversion challenging. Quantitative \ninterpretation can yield direct estimates of CO2 layer thicknesses, which, when \nintegrated with spectral decomposition and constrained AVO can yield improved \nestimates of layer velocities. Recent work on the Sleipner data using whole waveform \ninversion in the frequency domain has the potential to further improve resolution of \nthe inversion tool. Work on common-focus point processing and velocity tomography \nis also in progress.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nBorgos, H.
