This study aimed to\ntest the feasibility and acceptability of the recruitment, allocation, measurement, retention and intervention procedures of a\nrandomised controlled trial of an intervention to improve physical activity and dietary practices amongst obese adults with\nadditional obesity related risk factors.\nMethod: Pilot single centre open-labelled outcome assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial of obese (Body Mass Index\n(BMI)$30 kg\/m2) adults (age$18 y) with obesity related co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance\nor hypertension. Participants were randomly allocated to a manual-based group intervention or a leaflet control condition in\naccordance to a 2:1 allocation ratio. Primary outcome was acceptability and feasibility of trial procedures, secondary\noutcomes included measures of body composition, physical activity, food intake and psychological process measures.\nResults: Out of 806 potentially eligible individuals identified through list searches in two primary care general medical\npractices N= 81 participants (63% female; mean-age = 56.56(11.44); mean-BMI = 36.73(6.06)) with 2.35(1.47) co-morbidities\nwere randomised. Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) was the only significant predictor of providing consent to\ntake part in the study (higher chances of consent for invitees with lower levels of deprivation). Participant flowcharts,\nqualitative and quantitative feedback suggested good acceptance and feasibility of intervention procedures but 34.6% of\nrandomised participants were lost to follow-up due to overly high measurement burden and sub-optimal retention\nprocedures. Participants in the intervention group showed positive trends for most psychological, behavioural and body\ncomposition outcomes.\nConclusions: The intervention procedures were found to be acceptable and feasible.

Excess body weight is associated with a\ncluster of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors [4] and there is\ncompelling evidence linking obesity to the risk for cardiovascular\ndisease [5,6], type 2 diabetes mellitus [7,8], cancer [9,10] and other\nconditions [11] resulting in considerable disability [12], premature\nmortality [13] and health service costs [14]. Obese individuals with\nadditional obesity-related risk factors (e.g., impaired glucose\ntolerance) and secondary conditions (e.g., Type 2 diabetes mellitus)\nhave a higher risk for further ill health, consume more health service\ncosts and would therefore benefit most from effective interventions\ntargeting food intake, physical activity and weight loss.\nA recent systematic review of 44 Randomised Controlled Trials\n(RCTs) of behavioural interventions for obese adults with\nadditional obesity-related risk factors and\/or co-morbidities\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23040\nshowed that interventions targeting both, dietary and physical\nactivity changes, result in consistent improvements in weight and\nweight-related cardiovascular disease risk factors [15]. However,\nthe effects of these interventions are smaller compared with\nsystematic reviews not limiting study inclusion to participants with\nadditional risk factors [16,17]. This suggests that achieving\nbehaviour change, consequent weight loss and risk reduction is\nmore difficult amongst individuals who have already developed\nadditional risk factors and obesity related disease.\nIntervention Development\nInterventions for health should be based on best evidence and\ntheory to optimise their effectiveness and understand how and why\ninterventions do or do not work [18,19,20,21]. However, previous\nweight loss interventions have rarely been systematically developed\nand published reports do not describe if and how evidence or\nrelevant theory informed the content or delivery of weight loss\ntreatment [22]. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical\nExcellence obesity guidelines suggest that obesity research needs to\nidentify what \u2018elements make an intervention effective and\nsustainable\u2019 p. 63 [23]. The current paper reports a randomised\nfeasibility trial of an intervention resulting from a systematic,\nevidence-informed development process in line with recent\nguidelines and methodologies for developing complex interven-\ntions for health [18,19,24].\nWe conducted a systematic review of 44 RCTs of behavioural\ninterventions targeting dietary and\/or physical activity changes in\nobese adults with additional obesity-related co-morbidities (e.g.,\nType 2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease) or risk factors\nfor co-morbidities (e.g., impaired glucose tolerance or hypercho-\nlesterolaemia), representing a total of more than 10,000 partici-\npants [15]. Each of the usually complex interventions included in\nthe review was thoroughly characterised in terms of a) modes of\ndelivery (e.g., face-to-face versus computer delivered, individual\nversus group setting), b) use of theory in defining the content and\nintermediate targets of intervention techniques and\/or the\ncombination and sequence of their delivery and c) the use of\nbehaviour change techniques (e.g., goal setting, provision of\nknowledge, etc) based on a recent reliable taxonomy of behaviour\nchange techniques [25,26]. Meta regression was used to identify\nintervention features associated with intervention effectiveness\n[27]. The review found that neither the mode of intervention\ndelivery nor the timing of the active intervention period were\nassociated with effectiveness in achieving weight loss, whereas\ninterventions with more frequent contact with participants\nachieved higher weight loss. Studies recruiting from clinical\nsettings were less effective than studies recruiting from community\nsettings and marginally less effective than studies recruiting\nthrough general practice. No significant associations between the\nnumber of behaviour change techniques utilised and effectiveness\nwere found. However, studies utilising techniques of intention\nformation\/goal setting, self-monitoring of behaviour, action planning, barrier\nidentification\/coping planning, review of behavioural goals, prompting practice,\nplanning contingent rewards; relapse prevention were more effective in\nachieving weight loss. Moreover, the review found that studies\nusing behaviour change techniques congruent with Self-Regula-\ntion Theory [28,29], Social Cognitive Theory [30], Social\nComparison Theory [31] were more effective than studies using\nother techniques, suggesting these theories as a useful framework\nfor the development of a new intervention. Based on this evidence,\na draft intervention manual was developed involving the clinical\nexpertise of physicians caring for obese adults, dieticians, health\/\nclinical psychologists, and nutritionists. Intervention materials\ndeveloped were informed by publicly available materials of\nsuccessful trials included in the review [32], previous RCTs of\nthe researchers [33,34,35] and the UK Health Trainer manual\n[36]. A comprehensive training programme was developed for\ndelivery by health professionals.\nPilot studies\nAcceptability and feasibility of the draft intervention materials\nand procedures were tested in an initial pilot study without\noutcome measurement in a group of 12 adults participating in a\ncommunity-based public weight management programme where\nthe intervention was found acceptable and popular amongst\nparticipants. Subsequently, an open, uncontrolled before-and-after\npilot study with consecutive recruitment of eight small groups of\nusers of an urban hospital-based obesity clinic (N= 74) was\nconducted. This open pilot allowed systematic intervention\nadaptation and refinement in accordance with ongoing feedback.\nOngoing quantitative and qualitative assessments of acceptability\nand satisfaction were collected from participants and measures of\nacceptability and feasibility by the research nurse delivering the\nintervention. Overall satisfaction was 94.5% and participants\nshowed positive changes in physical activity and weight pre-post\nstudy and trends toward improved dietary practices. Minor\nchanges reflecting participants\u2019 and facilitators\u2019 feedback were\nmade, further improving the intervention (e.g., materials were\nadapted, the duration of sessions was increased from 60 to\n90 minutes and a follow-up session was added) [37].\nBased on the evidence from this systematic development\nprocess, the current study aimed to test feasibility and acceptability\nof procedures for recruitment, allocation, measurement, retention,\nand for the intervention to inform a definitive RCT of this novel,\nsystematically developed intervention for obese adults with\nadditional obesity-related risk factors and co-morbid conditions.\nWe pre-specified the following criteria for considering the protocol\nviable for a definitive RCT without modification: a) a recruitment\nrate of at least 10% of eligible patients (based on typical rates for\nstudy recruitment through general medical practices in the region),\nb) attrition rates of less than 20% (based on systematic review\nevidence and typical risk of attrition bias considerations [15,38]\nand compliance rates (group attendance and material completion)\nof 60% (based on open pilot study [37]). If these targets were not\nmet, modifications to the protocol in the light of the study\u2019s\nfindings and potentially further pilot work would be required.\nMethods\nThe protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist\nare available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and\nProtocol S1.\nEthics\nThe study protocol (Protocol S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 and\nS9) was approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics\nCommittee (REC 09\/S0801\/54), 28th May 2009.

Exclusion criteria were: current\ntreatment for cancer, dementia or significant psychiatric illness,\ninability to give informed consent, inability to comply with trial\nprotocol (e.g. terminally ill, housebound) and insufficient language\nskills to complete consent procedures.\nStudy setting\nThe Clinical Research Facility of the University of Aberdeen,\nset up at the central hospital site for ambulatory clinical research\nsuch as clinical trials staffed with specifically trained research\nnurses.\nInterventions\nParticipants were randomly allocated to either a face-to-face\ngroup behaviour change intervention focusing on dietary and\nphysical activity changes for weight loss, or a control group.\nFace-to-face group intervention\nThis manual and material-based intervention (Intervention\nManual S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6) consisted of five weekly group\nsessions, and one follow-up session (week 8). Sessions lasted\n,90 min and were delivered by one researcher with 7 years of\nexperience, a BA in Midwifery, a BSc in Environmental Health\nand an MSc in Public Health and current training in research\nmethods and communication skills. Participants missing sessions\nwere sent materials and details of the next meeting. Facilitator\ntraining consisted of three 4 h workshops delivered by VAS, SUD\nand FFS.\nIntervention participants completed self-selected weekly goals\nbetween sessions, kept a behavioural diary and used a provided\npedometer (HJ-113 piezoelectric pedometer-Omron Healthcare\nLtd. Milton Keynes, UK). The intervention comprised of\nevidence-based behaviour change techniques (BCTs) [25,26]\nfound to be associated with effective physical activity and dietary\ninterventions for the target population [27], including intention\nformation\/goal setting, self-monitoring of behaviour, action planning, barrier\nidentification\/coping planning, review of behavioural goals, prompting practice,\nplanning contingent rewards and relapse prevention. These were delivered\nthrough facilitator advice as well as paper and pencil materials\nused during the sessions. Participants were asked to complete and\nreturn weekly booklets which formed the basis of small group\ndiscussions with the facilitator based on the prior reading of\nsubmitted booklets.\nParticipants in both groups received two British Heart\nFoundation (BHF) booklets: a) \u2018So you want to lose weight for\ngood\u2019- including information on portion sizes, a daily eating plan\nand a section to track progress, and b) \u2018Get Active\u2019, including\nrecommendations and types of safe physical activity, outlines\npositive health benefits of physical activity and briefly addresses\nbarriers.\nControl group\nParticipants received standard care and two BHF leaflets as\ndescribed above by post.\nMeasurement\nOutcome and process measures were taken before randomisa-\ntion (Time 1) and six months later (Time 3), using a combination\nof face-to-face measurement by a research nurse (anthropometric\nand performance measures) and postal questionnaires (self-reports\nof food intake, physical activity; and psychological process\nmeasures). The postal questionnaire was repeated three months\nfollowing randomisation (Time 2).\nAcceptability and feasibility\nThe primary outcome for this study was acceptability and\nfeasibility of procedures for recruitment, allocation, measurement,\nretention and for the intervention procedures. Recruitment rates\nwere measured as rate of invited participants consenting\/eligible\nand are reported in a CONSORT participant flow chart (Figure 1).\nAcceptability of allocation procedures was assessed examining\nreasons for dropout in discontinuing participants and comparing\nattrition rates between both conditions. Suitability of measurement\nprocedures was evaluated based on completion rates and, where\napplicable, psychometric information about reliability. Attrition\nrates were established as discontinuation of intervention and loss to\nfollow-up measurement for both conditions. We also recorded\ncompletion of intervention materials as an indicator of participa-\ntion. We attempted fidelity assessment through audio-recordings\nof intervention sessions. However, these recordings are not\navailable as the facilitator perceived manual recordings as\nobtrusive to the proceedings and discontinued the recording.\nTrial outcomes\nIn addition to acceptability and feasibility, we measured the\nfollowing anthropometric and performance outcomes relevant for\na full trial: weight in kg, height in cm, waist circumference, waist-\nto-hip ratio, %body fat (Omron BF306 handhold body fat\nmonitor), blood pressure, resting heart rate and the 6-minute\nwalk test [39] to assess fitness were all objectively measured at\nTime 1 and Time 3 by an experienced research nurse using\nstandard operating procedures in the Clinical Research Facility,\nAberdeen of University. Dyspnea and fatigue pre and post\n6 minute walk test were measured on a standard 10 point Borg\nscale [40].\nQuestionnaires administered at Time 1, Time 2 and Time 3\nincluded self-reported physical activity [41], walking in min\/day\nand dietary intake through a validated food frequency question-\nnaire [42]. Process measures included a Theory of Planned\nBehaviour (TPB) questionnaire [43], Action Planning and Coping\nPlanning Scales [44], and the Action Control Scale [45] for\nphysical activity and adherence to a healthy weight loss diet as well\nas the ENRICHd Social Support Scale [46] and a shortened\nversion of the Illness Perception Questionnaire\u2013R (IPQ-R PS)\n[47,48].\nSample size\nThe study aimed to recruit 90 participants as this gives precision\nof at least 5 percentage points on any estimated acceptability\/\nfeasibility proportion (i.e. the 95% confidence interval limits\naround the estimated proportion of, for instance, willingness to be\nrandomised 610%) [49].\nRandomisation\nIndividual computer generated randomisation to intervention\nor control condition in a 2:1 ratio, using a secure centralised web-\nbased randomisation system provided by the Health Services\nResearch Unit (HSRU), connected to a database with appropriate\nIntervention for High Risk Obese Adults\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23040\nuser level security. Randomisation was performed by FFS.\nParticipants were informed about condition allocation by KR\nwithout involvement of the outcome assessor.\nBlinding\nParticipants and intervention facilitator were aware of condition\nallocations. The outcome assessor was blinded to allocation.\nReturning participants at Time 3 assessment were asked not to\ndisclose allocation. The assessor was instructed to remind\nparticipants not to disclose study group allocation.\nStatistical analyses\nWe describe the response rates to invitation, recruitment and\nadherence using proportions for the whole pilot group, and by\nintervention group at each time point. We investigated the\ncompletion patterns of materials. Reliability of instruments was\nassessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha over the whole pilot group\nirrespective of treatment allocation. Logistic regression analysis\nwas used to investigate if invitees who provided consent to\nparticipate differed from those who did not in terms of\ndemographics, clinical variables, general practice or post code\nlinked Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation deciles (SIMD) [50].\nWe originally planned to use the intervention group data to explore\nany potential clustering due to the intervention being delivered to\ngroups of participants and estimate an intra-cluster correlation to\ninform power calculations for any future RCTs. However, given the\nloss to follow-up it was not feasible to calculate the correlations. No\nclustering occurred in the control group. Effect size for the main\noutcome was explored using analysis of covariance.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the CONSORT flowchart for this study.\nEight hundred and six eligible individuals, aged between 19\u201389\nyears (mean=57.3, SD=15.2) were identified, and sent a study\ninvitation. 260 (32.3%) invitees responded and 133 (51.2%)\nprovided informed consent. The procedures did not allow checking\nof the percentage of invitees who received the invitation letter. Due\nto the initially high consent rates, it was decided not to send\nreminders to invitees as 133 consents were considered sufficient to\nreach the target of n= 90 participants randomised. A multiple\nlogistic regression analysis examined if consent was related to\ngender, age, SIMD, or type and number of obesity related co-\nmorbidities\/risk factors (Table 1). SIMD emerged as a significant\npredictor (p= .007) for providing consent to take part in the study;\nfor every increase in SIMD score (indicating lower deprivation\nlevels), the odds of participation increased by 1.3 times.\nConsenting participants were sent a baseline questionnaire,\nwhich was returned by 106 individuals who received invitations to\nattend baseline assessment. Twenty-five participants were exclud-\nFigure 1.

The remaining 81 participants were\nrandomised. These participants had Type 1 diabetes (n = 1;\n1.2%), Type 2 diabetes (n = 17; 21%), IGT (n= 9; 11.1%),\nhypertension (n= 47; 58.0%), heart disease (n = 15; 18.5%),\ncerebrovascular disease (n = 2; 2.5%), rheumatoid\/osteo-arthritis\n(n = 20; 24.7), hyperlipidaemia (n = 13; 16%) and COPD\/Asthma\n(n = 22; 27.2%); n= 44 (54.3%) participants were regular statin\nusers.\nTable 2 shows the pre-randomisation baseline characteristics.\nThe total sample was on average 56.6 years (SD=11.4), 63%\n(n= 51) female, BMI of 36.73 kg\/m2 (SD=6.1) and were\ndiagnosed with 2.4 (SD=1.5) additional risk factors\/comorbidi-\nties. Mean SIMD decile was 4.8 (SD=3.1; range 1 [lowest level of\nsocial deprivation]-10[highest level of deprivation]).\nBaseline characteristics of control and intervention\ngroups\nParticipants allocated to the control condition were more likely\nto be female (71.4% vs. 58.5%), older (Mcontrol = 61.0 years vs.\nMintervention = 54.4), shorter (Mcontrol = 164.6 vs. Mintervention =\n166.0), lighter (Mcontrol = 93.8 kg vs. Mintervention = 104.8 kg), and\nwith a smaller waist circumference (Mcontrol = 111.1 cm vs.\nMintervention = 115.9 cm). Since group allocation was randomised,\nno p-tests for differences were conducted as the null-hypothesis of\np-tests stating that both groups are taken from the same\npopulation, is already given. Due to an oversight, one participant\nwith a BMI of 25.7 was included in the study and randomised to\nthe control group. This participant did not provide follow-up data.\nFour participants had a BMI.50 (50.2; 51.0; 56.6; 61.2) and were\nall randomised to the intervention condition. Intervention\nparticipants reported higher fat, alcohol and calorie intake, and\nslightly lower levels of baseline physical activity compared to\ncontrol participants. Since the randomisation procedure was\nrobust and not compromised, these differences are most likely\ndue to chance and a result of the small sample size, particularly in\nthe control condition as a result of the unbalanced randomisation\n(2:1).\nIntervention procedures and participation\nOf 53 participants randomised to the intervention 49 were\nallocated to one of seven groups ranging from 4\u20139 participants.\nReasons for initial dropout were \u2018too busy\u2019 (n = 2), \u2018leaving the\ncountry\u2019 (n = 1) or \u2018no reason\u2019 (n = 1). Of 49 allocated participants\n40 attended at least 1 session. Reasons for not attending a single\nsession were \u2018not known\u2019 (n = 3), \u2018illness\u2019 (n = 2), \u2018too busy\u2019, \u2018family\ncrisis\u2019, \u2018no reason\u2019, and \u2018transport\u2019 (all n = 1). Of the 40 attending\nparticipants a further 6 did not complete the intervention due to\n\u2018illness\u2019 (n = 3), \u2018too busy\u2019 (n = 2) and \u2018family crisis\u2019 (n = 1). Total\nloss to follow-up in the intervention group was n= 21 (39.6%),\nattrition amongst those who attended at least one session was 15%.\nIn the control intervention, three participants (10.7%) discon-\ntinued study participation explicitly referring to disappointment\nabout their allocation. During initial telephone contacts, anecdotal\nevidence suggested that participants intended to drop out if\nallocated to the control condition (labelled written information\nintervention). It was not possible to obtain a reliable measure for\nparticipants reading the leaflets sent to them.\nSession attendance\nOf n= 49 allocated participants the average attendance was 3.8\n(SD=2.4), equalling an average attendance of 64.2% of allocated\nsession slots. Participants completing the intervention attended an\naverage of 5.2 (SD=1.2) sessions. Twenty-one participants\nattended all 6 scheduled sessions (43%). The majority of\nparticipants attended session 1 (n = 40, 81%), with numbers\nreducing to 34 (69%), 32 (65%), 29 (59%), 29 (59%) and 23 (47%)\nfor sessions 2 to 6 respectively. Due to facilitator illness, session 6\nhad to be rescheduled once with only half the participants (n = 3)\nreturning for the final session.\nThe original intention for this feasibility trial was to form groups\nof 10 but due to limited staff capacity, initial assessment and\nconsequently randomisation was slow. In order to avoid longer\nwaiting times, smaller groups were formed. Since not all\nparticipants attended, some groups were too small (e.g. n = 4).\nAttendance varied by intervention group. The two groups with the\nlowest attendance had the lowest number of participants scheduled\nTable 1.

Group 6, experienced parking problems\nwith the parking attendant refusing to accept valid parking\npermits, leading to 3 participants not being able to attend the\nsessions and subsequently dropping out. Scotland experienced a\nsevere winter with considerable snowfall and disruption to traffic\nand public transport during the main period of intervention\ndelivery. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this made attendance at\nsessions difficult, and may have contributed to attrition.\nMaterial completion\nOf 49 allocated participants the average number of intervention\nbooklets returned was 2.9 (SD=2.1) out of 5, an average booklet\nreturn of 58%. Participants returned .50% of booklets for all\nsessions except 5. Participants attending a session returned 77.6%\n(SD=12.8) of received booklets. Lowest returns were noted for\nsessions 1 (67%) and 5 (61%). For session 1, the majority of\nunreturned booklets (n = 5, 38%) was in the first group, with the\nfacilitator not explicitly mentioning the need to return booklets.\nThe increase for booklets participants received in session 5 could\nhave resulted from the longer interval between sessions 5 and 6.\nProcess measures, psychometric properties and\ncompletion of questionnaires\nAt baseline, completion of the questionnaire was a prerequisite\nfor randomisation. Postal questionnaires containing self-reports of\nbehaviour and psychological process measures were returned at\nTime 2 by n=42 (51.9%) and at Time 3 n=48 (59.3%) participants\nindicating that a postal questionnaire might be a limited method to\nobtain process measures from all participants. Not all participants\ncompleted the self-report of behaviour. The Godin Leisure Time\nPhysical Activity Index [41] was available at Time 2 from n=30\nand Time 3 from n=37 participants. Data for the Food Frequency\nQuestionnaire [42] were available for n= 41 at Time 2 and n=26\nat Time 3. There was anecdotal evidence from participants who\nreceived telephone calls reminding them about returning the\nquestionnaire that the food frequency questionnaire in particular\nwas perceived as unduly lengthy and complicated.\nTable 3 shows that participants at baseline attributed their obesity\nmore often to energy balance behaviours than to emotional\/\npsychological, genetic or external causes.

This reduction in numbers\nsuggests that the baseline questionnaire was not sufficiently\nacceptable to participants. Of 106 participants who returned the\nbaseline questionnaire, an unexpectedly high number could not be\nrandomised; due to inaccurate\/outdated GP medical records,\nparticipants withdrawing or inability to contact patients. Therefore\n81 (10.0% of those initially invited), rather than 90 individuals\nwere randomised. These figures can inform estimates of the\nnumber of invitations required for a definitive trial.\nWe also found that people from more deprived neighbourhoods\nwere slightly less likely to consent to taking part in this research.\nThis small effect replicates prior research [51]. More research is\nneeded to understand the mechanisms between this common\neffect and more extensive user involvement in the development of\nrecruitment procedures might help further decreasing social\ninequalities in participation in randomised trials [52]. Overall,\nthese findings suggest a) sending reminders to invitees b)\ndecreasing the measurement burden and c) involving users in\nthe redraft of participant information procedures to reduce bias in\nsocio-economic status for a definite RCT.\nFeasibility, acceptability and reliability of outcome\nmeasures\nAll main outcome measures taken in a face-to-face setting in the\nClinical Research Facility were found to be acceptable and feasible\nto participants and staff conducting the measurement as indicated\nby completion rates. The study found clear limitations in taking\nmeasures by postal questionnaires. The response rates for the\nquestionnaires at Time 2 and Time 3 were lower than for the\nanthropometric and performance assessment conducted face to\nface. While there were relatively few missing values for the\npsychological process variables measured in the same question-\nnaire, outcome data for physical activity and diet at Time 3 were\navailable for .50% of the initial sample. The Food Frequency\nQuestionnaire was long and required detailed reporting for a day\u2019s\nworth of dietary intake. The high levels of missing values for the\nGodin Leisure Time Physical Activity Index were more unex-\npected as this measure has frequently been used in similar\npopulations before. Overall, the questionnaire might have been\ntoo long and in parts too complicated for participants. For a future\ntrial, it would be advisable to collect the behavioural outcome data\nface-to-face and to reduce the measurement burden through\nprocess measures.\nThe psychological process measures showed better completion\nrates and reliability. These measures are acceptable and feasible.\nOn the IPQ-R PS, participants reported low levels of coherence\n(e.g., understanding their obesity problem) and low perceptions\nof personal control over their obesity. The intervention addresses\nthe latter, by targeting people\u2019s sense of control over their food\nintake and physical activity, but not the former, since education\nand provision of information where not found to be effective\ntechniques in the systematic review informing this intervention\n[27]. However, in the light of this evidence, it might be sensible\nto add an advice session to the intervention to ensure the\nnecessary and accurate knowledge and feeling of control over\ntheir weight problem. Motivation to engage in physical activity\nand dietary changes was generally high, and slightly more\nfavourable for diet than for physical activity. Generally,\nparticipants reported low baseline levels of self-regulation and\nplanning. These factors were explicitly targeted as part of the\nintervention and were addressed extensively during training of\nthe group facilitator.\nFeasibility and acceptability of trial and intervention\nprocedures\nImportant lessons about the trial procedures were learned.\nOverall loss to follow-up of 34.6% is unacceptably high to proceed\nto a full RCT. In addition to the excessive measurement burden\nintroduced through the food frequency questionnaire, specific\nissues in both conditions were identified as contributing to\nattrition. Some participants allocated to the control condition\ndropped out of the trial because they were disappointed not to be\nallocated to the face-to-face intervention. Consequently, for a full\ntrial, a more attractive control intervention or a waiting list design\nshould be considered.\nFor the behaviour change intervention group, patterns of\nretention were more complex and two main challenges emerged.\nFirstly, out of 53 individuals allocated to the intervention only 49\nwere available to be scheduled for an intervention group meeting.\nThe relative small scale of this pilot study did not allow offering\nmore alternative time slots for group sessions and in a future\ndefinitive trial it would be critical to either clarify the times of\ngroup sessions at the invitation stage, or to match group sessions to\nthe availability of participants. Secondly, only 40 participants\nattended at least one meeting. The fact that nearly 20% of those\nwho agreed to attend a session at a particular time never attended\na single meeting indicates a substantial problem frequently\nobserved in health service delivery and clinical trials that\nindividuals do not attend scheduled appointments. Recently,\nseveral studies have shown that inexpensive theory based\nintervention based on simple planning interventions, letters or\nleaflets may be effective in improving attendance [53,54] and for\nthe present line of research it might be sensible to explicitly add an\nintervention focussing on attendance to the first meeting in order\nto improve participation. For those participants who attended at\nleast one meeting, the intervention was found to be highly\nacceptable as indicated by intervention retention and material\ncompletion. Smaller groups had higher attrition, and the group\nfacilitator reported better group dynamics in larger groups. The\nfact that it was not found feasible in this small scale study to form\nlarger groups due to the relatively small number of participants,\nmight have further increased attrition. In the future conducting a\nlarger scale trial with more participants and sufficient staff time\nwould enable the composition of larger groups. In addition,\nparticular events (facilitator illness; parking problems, major snow\ndisruptions, small groups, pandemic swine flu) had an impact on\nthe study. Where no particular events impacted on the\nproceedings, the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention\nprocedures were high, replicating the prior pilot study in\nsecondary care. Material completion rates were high, indicating\nintervention engagement as intended.\nThis study has shown that there are sufficient numbers of\npotential participants living in the geographic area served by two\nprimary care medical practices meeting the eligibility criteria to\nconduct a definitive RCT of the intervention delivered in this\nstudy. The main implications for a full trial are twofold. First, it\nwould be advisable to hold intervention sessions in a community\nrather than hospital setting, reducing travel and parking problems.\nSecond, it is critical to ensure availability of sufficient staff for a\nfuture trial, an issue which proved problematic in this feasibility\nstudy. Limited capacity in baseline assessment resulted in slow\nparticipant intake and smaller than expected intervention group\nsizes. Limited capacity in staff delivering the intervention resulted\nin several sessions being cancelled due to illness of the facilitator.\nBoth factors were associated with attrition. In this regard,\nmanaging a larger trial using similar method might indeed prove\neasier to manage.\nIntervention for High Risk Obese Adults\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 August 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e23040\nChanges in outcomes\nDespite robust randomisation procedures we found consider-\nable imbalances between intervention and control groups. In\nparticular, the intervention group included participants who were\nmore obese and more men, reflecting the small scale nature of this\nstudy. In a definitive trial a minimisation procedure with BMI\nincluded in the minimisation variables should be used to allocate\nparticipants to groups.\nFor all objectively recorded outcomes of body composition and\ncardiovascular function, positive changes favouring the interven-\ntion were observed. Intervention participants lost on average\n2.58 kg (3.91) of weight at 6 months and 4.24 cm (4.12) waist\ncircumference. Only changes in 6 Minute Walk Test performances\ndid not show a trend favouring the intervention group, although\ntrends favouring the intervention group for pre-post changes in\ndyspnoea and fatigue were found. The study was not powered to\ndetect group differences, therefore trends should not be over-\nemphasised even though the intervention group lost significantly\nmore waist circumference than controls. The weight change is\nslightly lower compared to the mean weight difference of our\nsystematic review which includes considerably more intensive\ninterventions. Further trends for increased physical activity\nfavouring the intervention and decreased calorie intake in both\ngroups were found based on very small sample sizes.\nConclusion\nWe found that a protocol for a RCT of a relatively brief six\nsession behaviour change intervention for obese adults with\nadditional risk factors based on a systematic and evidence based\ndevelopment process needs further modification to be viable for a\ndefinitive effectiveness trial. Based on the data from this feasibility\ntrial, changes to recruitment, measurement and retention\nprocedures are proposed.\nThe intervention procedures were shown to be acceptable to\nparticipants attending at least one session and trends in changes in\noutcome variables favoured the intervention group but the trial\nthat was not powered to detect group differences. Methods to\nfurther improve feasibility and acceptability of the trial procedures\nwere identified and will be implemented in a subsequent definitive\nRCT.\nSupporting Information\nChecklist S1 CONSORT Checklist.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S1 Protocol Main Document.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S2\nProtocol appendix 1: General Practice Invitation Letter; version 1.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S3\nProtocol appendix 2: General Practice Fact Sheet; version 2.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S4\nProtocol appendix 3: Patient Invitation from GP; version 2.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S5\nProtocol appendix 4: Participant Information; version 4.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S6\nProtocol appendix 5: Reply Slip; version 2; 21 07 2009.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S7\nProtocol appendix 6: Consent Form; version 3.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S8\nProtocol appendix 7: Standard Operating Procedures for Blood\npressure and Heart Rate Measurement, Clinical Research Facility,\nUniversity of Aberdeen.\n(DOC)\nProtocol S9\nProtocol appendix 8: 6 Minute Walk Test Standard Operating\nProcedures.\n(DOC)\nIntervention Manual S1 Intervention Manual Session 1.\n(PDF)\nIntervention Manual S2 Intervention Manual Session 2.\n(PDF)\nIntervention Manual S3 Intervention Manual Session 3.\n(PDF)\nIntervention Manual S4 Intervention Manual Session 4.\n(PDF)\nIntervention Manual S5 Intervention Manual Session 5.\n(PDF)\nIntervention Manual S6 Intervention Manual Session 6.\n(PDF)\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to thank Dale Sherriff for delivering the intervention and\nCarol Burman for conducting the assessments in the Clinical Research\nFacility in Aberdeen, as well as all the participants for supporting this\nresearch.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: FFS VA-S SUD AA MJ PM\nCRR.
