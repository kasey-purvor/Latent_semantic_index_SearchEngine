Developments have been technology-led, and the major\nuse of the network has been for administration. The Computer-Supported Experiential Learning\nProject has been designed to refocus upon the curriculum, and to encourage academic staff to use\nthe network technologies for teaching and learning. The broad aim of the project is to investigate\nand systematically evaluate the appropriate use of technology to improve the quality of learning.\nThe curriculum model\nThe theoretical framework for the research is a well-established curriculum model developed by\nKolb (1984) which links theory and practice (see Figure 1). This model is relevant in a range of\n39\nMan Stale\/ and Diana Eastcott Computer-supported experiential learning (Phase One - staff development)\nConcrete\nexperience\nActive Reflective\nexperimentation observation\nAbstract\nconceptualisation\nFigure l:The Kolb Learning Cycle\neducational contexts from continuing professional development to vocationally orientated\nundergraduate courses. It has been used effectively by the authors of this paper on a wide range\nof staff development programmes.\nThe crucial elements of this model are the links it makes between theory and practice; or, in the\nwords of Kolb, between 'concrete experience' and 'abstract conceptualization'. It is common\nfor university courses to be described as either practical or theoretical. Similarly, it is often said\nthat theories are taught at university but 'real' learning is what happens out in the workplace.\nHowever, it is not sufficient just to have an experience in order to learn. Equally, it is not\nsufficient simply to learn new concepts. This learning must be tested out in new situations. The\nlearner needs to make the link between theory and action by planning for that action, carrying it\nout, and then reflecting upon it, relating what happens back to the theory.\nExperiential learning in the context of the model designed by Kolb involves a systematic,\ncyclical sequence of learning activities. The cycle may be entered by the learner at any point,\nbut its stages must be followed in sequence. The interesting pedagogical issue is to develop\nappropriate learning and teaching strategies at each stage of the cycle. In other words, to\nprovide structures which help learners to link theory and practice.\nThe 'reflective observation' and 'active experimentation' stages of the cycle are crucial.\nReflective observation is the process of reflecting on an experience and making sense of it.\nBased on the work of Schon (1987) on the reflective practitioner, this stage of the learning cycle\nacknowledges the complexity of professional working practices where each decision is made in\nrelation to the individual's own repertoire of examples, values, commitments and knowledge. In\nreality, reflection overlaps with the 'abstract conceptualization' stage of the cycle where new\nideas and knowledge help the learner to have insights and to understand situations in a different\n40\nALT-} Volume 7 Number I\nway. The active experimentation stage of the cycle is the point where the learner plans how to\nmake the link between theory and action. Concrete experience is therefore the practice of trying\nout the ideas in the workplace.\nThe stages of the cycle are by no means clear-cut. Considerable overlap can occur, as noted\nabove. Work on learning styles (Kolb, 1974; Honey and Mumford, 1986) indicates that just as\nthere is seen to be a division between theory and practice in education, so individuals may have\nparticular preferences in their learning. Distinct styles of learning associated with the four\nstages of the experiential learning cycle have been identified, some learners being stronger at\nthe 'practical' aspects, others at the 'theoretical' part of the cycle.\nApplication of technology to the curriculum model\nThe application of Kolb's model to Phase 1 is described in terms of abstract conceptualization,\nconcrete experience, active experimentation and reflective observation.\nAbstract conceptualization\nAcademic staff spend considerable tune in lectures expounding facts, theories, and concepts to\nstudents that constitute the knowledge base of a subject. The effectiveness of lectures has often\nbeen questioned (Bligh, 1972; Gibbs, 1982), and it is suggested that precious time with students\ncould be better spent elsewhere in the Kolb Cycle. A subject knowledge base can be constructed\nas a Web (or intranet) site that students access in their independent learning time. That is not to\nsuggest 'discovery' learning, where students discover things for themselves in a haphazard way\n(e.g. surfing the net), but rather a focused pursuit of knowledge. Key to this pursuit of\nknowledge are the learning activities within the site that students must do for real in the\nconcrete experience stage of the cycle. In this way, the students' learning is being 'driven' by\nactivities and problems, as described by Boud (1991).\nElton (1996) has suggested that we should not always expect students to be intrinsically\nmotivated by our subject, and that students' intrinsic motivation will improve as they gain a\nsense of achievement or progress. Therefore, it is suggested that this stage of the cycle could\ninclude some formative computer-assisted assessment (CAA), so that students can check their\nunderstanding of key issues before putting theory into practice.\nConcrete experience\nIn the post-Dearing age of lifelong learning it seems likely that work-based learning will grow,\nand links between theory and practice will need to be more explicit. Experiencing 'real world'\nproblems is crucial to this model, and it is envisaged that where possible learning activities\nembedded within the Web site can be performed in a working environment. Where this is not\npossible (as in many full-time undergraduate programmes) it is suggested that academic staff\ncreate 'substitute experiences' such as role-plays, mock courts, client briefings etc. In this way,\nclass-contact time is shifting from conceptualizing to experiencing. Whilst the authors\nacknowledge that some experiences can be simulated by computer, this is considered to be a last\nresort, used only wliere real experiences are too dangerous, expensive, or not practical.\nActive experimentation and reflective observation\nIt is at these stages of the cycle that computer-mediated communication (CMC) is of particular\nimportance. In active experimentation students can email their online tutor or mentor concern-\ning their plans for putting theory into practice. The online tutor can individually guide and\n41\nAlan Stale\/ and Diana Eastcott Computer-supported experiential teaming (Phase One - staff development)\nC M O M IbHcd) \u00bb die thon\nimAadowrt.aaniytaied'wiattopi.\n\u2022 t \u00abpplyi\u00abt I IKOIT 10\npractice with tvtor by\nE-asall - private 1:1\nvhich allows may 10\noust? comnaaicatioa.\n(taBcti\u00bbbc\u00abik,elKtnaic\nNew Has sad eoaospa andopod m WWW style\npifes. todod\u00abe aaWnse tot camma* mdon H\nwledse.

Reflective observation is well suited to online conferencing, where\ngroups of students can work co-operatively to reflect upon how the theories worked in practice,\nand how the different contexts in which students have been working have influenced this.\nOnline conferencing is particularly suited to this, due to its asynchronous nature, which gives\nstudents time to think and make a considered contribution, unlike many face-to-face\ncommunications (McConnell, 1994). The member of academic staff is now functioning as a\ngroup facilitator as opposed to an individual mentor.\nIn summary, several technologies are being suggested, each having a specific purpose and place\nin the cycle. This is illustrated in Figure 2.\nInstigating organizational change\nRather than simply telling academic staff about this model, it was decided that all academic\nstaff within the University should have opportunity to experience it for themselves. An intranet\nsite was developed using Microsoft Front Page, that contained ideas and theories about\nteaching, learning and learning technology. This included practical activities and small-scale\nexperiments that staff could try out for real in their classes, i.e. putting theory into practice. The\nsite also contained email links to a team of online mentors who could be contacted for help and\nsupport. All staff visiting the site were initially asked to register their name and faculty. Staff\nwere also given the opportunity of taking part in several online discussion forums, one designed\nto reflect upon their experiments, and several others such as 'Rumours Central', created purely\nto entice staff into using the technology. This phase of the project lasted fifteen weeks, after\n42\nAu-J Volume 7 Number I\nwhich all staff not taking part were sent a questionnaire to establish the reasons for not\nparticipating, and their attitudes to learning technologies.\nParticipation\nIn total 59 staff participated in the project to some extent For some, this simply meant browsing\nthe site and registering. Others went on to use the online mentoring facility or discussion forums.\nAnalysis of the questionnaire revealed that another 30 staff visited the site but did not register.\nThe participants were from all faculties that have access to the network, indicating wide-\nranging interest in using learning technologies. The Vice-Chancellor and one Pro-Vice-\nChancellor participated, revealing senior management commitment However, only three\nmanagers (Deans, Associate Deans, Heads of Departments, and Heads of Schools) participated.\nAll other participants were lecturing staff.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that it is the younger staff that are attracted to learning\ntechnologies, and older staff demonstrate resistance to new technologies and changing work\npractices. This project did not substantiate this, as there was no significant difference between\nthe ages of those staff that participated, and those that did not. A gender bias did emerge though,\nas only 18.6 per cent of the participants were female, in a target population that was 39.8 per\ncent female.\nVery few staff used the online mentoring facility to assist putting theory into practice, although\nthere was considerable dialogue with one member of staff who was redesigning a course\nmodule. Many staff went straight to the discussion forums, and what follows is an analysis of\nthese. It can be clearly seen from Figure 3 that although staff started to participate as soon as the\nproject started, this soon diminished, reaching a low during Easter. Readvertising the project\nwith a sample of a 'rumours' discussion including a response from the Vice-Chancellor\nprovoked more response, but without doubt the greatest level of participation occurred after\n'Learning Technology Week', a week of awareness-raising events that brought staff together\nface-to-face.\nThis pattern of participation demonstrates the nature of online conferencing. Clearly, interest\nwanes and, unless there is some personal value to be obtained, participation will drop. Staff had\nno motive to participate other than curiosity; there was no assessment or certification to\nencourage participation. It is also worth noting how the face-to-face events generated interest\nand raised motivation.\nAn analysis of discussion entries per member of staff revealed that the discussions were\ndominated by one of the authors and a small group of staff. This pattern is similar to face-to-\nface discussions, with a small number of students frequently dominating events (Gibbs, 1992).\nWhile most staff only posted one or two messages (a tentative foray into the online world),\nsome staff really got involved. In several instances, these staff were not academic staff, but\ntechnical support staff who had found out about the project and instantly realized the\napplication to their area. Hence the 'technical queries' and 'intranet developments' discussion\nforums developed nicely. The discussion forum concerning teaching and learning issues was\nless spontaneous and needed considerable prompting from the authors. The rumours discussion\nforum was also slow to develop, with staff tending to read contributions but being reluctant to\nadd new ones. The greatest discussion in the rumours forum followed an example given by the\n43\nNan Staley and Diana Eastcott Computer-supported experiential learning (Phase One - staff development)\nComputer Supported Experiential Learning Project\n50\n45\n40\n35\n20\n15\n10\n5\n-No. of Staff Registered for Project\n-No. of Discussion Entries\nAdvertise\nProject\n1 LesmiflQ TechnnJwiLvWpjikJ %\nN \" T Y \"\n1 Re-Advertise 1\n\\\n^\nV L Easter .\nSi \u2022\u2022*.

Clearly,\nwhilst many of these discussions were light-hearted, they did entice staff to use the technology.\nOf the staff that did not participate in the project, 26.7 per cent completed a questionnaire\ndesigned to establish their views on learning technology. The major reason for not taking part in\nthe project was time (73.6 per cent of respondents). One respondent in particular expressed the\ntime demands that are placed upon academic staff:\nToo busy with full teaching, research, and admin load + HEFC + course revalidation + new\ncourse developments.\nOne barrier to the uptake of learning technology is therefore time, especially when one\nconsiders the 'up-front' investment in time that learning technology demands. Other barriers\nincluded problems of access to, and reliability of, the technology.\nOnly 9 per cent of respondents indicated that they were not interested in the project, and the\nattitude to learning technology was very encouraging. Few staff considered that their careers are\nthreatened by the technology. Most staff were interested in applying the technology to their\nteaching and learning and believed that learning technology would enhance the quality of\nstudent learning. The only other barrier that was identified was that of technical support, which ,\nis aptly summed up by one respondent:\n. . . this creates a huge barrier to encouraging me to do anything involving technology in my\nteaching and learning. If the IT environment improved, and the support culture existed, I\nwould get more involved. At present, I bang my head against a brick wall.\nOutcomes\nPhase 1 of the project has raised awareness, and actively involved academic staff in\nusing learning technology applied to an established curriculum model. It has encouraged\n44\nAa-J Valume 7 Number I\napproximately 40 staff to embed the use of learning technology in their own course modules in\nPhase 2 of the project. Training and support of the Learning Methods Unit will continue during\nthis phase. Phase 2 will evaluate fifteen learning technology projects across most faculties in the\nuniversity.\nReferences\nBligh, D. (1972), What's the Use of Lectures?, Penguin.\nBoud, D.
