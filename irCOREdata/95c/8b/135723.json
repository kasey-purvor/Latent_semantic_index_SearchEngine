We therefore investigated the role of intramelanosomal pH as a possible control mechanism for melanogenesis. To do this we examined the effect of neutralizing melanosomal pH on tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis in 11 human melanocyte cultures and in 3 melanoma lines. All melanocyte cultures (9 of 9) from Caucasian skin as well as two melanomacell lines with comparable melanogenic activity showed rapid (within 24 h) increases in melanogenesis in response to neutralization of melanosomal pH.

In summary, our findings show that: (i) near neutral melanosomal pH is optimal for human tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis; (ii) melanin production in Caucasian melanocytes is suppressed by low melanosomal pH; (iii) the ratio of eumelanin\/phaeomelanin production and maturation rate of melanosomes can be regulated by melanosomal pH. We conclude that melanosomal pH is an essential factor which regulates multiple stages of melanin production.
