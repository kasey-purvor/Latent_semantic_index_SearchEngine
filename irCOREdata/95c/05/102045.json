INTRODUCTION\nIf the field electron emission ~FE! theory assumed when\nextracting an emission area from a Fowler\u2013Nordheim ~FN!\nplot differs from the correct theory, then incorrect area values\nmay be derived. Forbes and Jensen showed this when ana-\nlyzing FE from a hemiellipsoidal emitter.1 However, the need\nto integrate emission current density over the emitter surface\nobscured this conclusion. This note illustrates the effect more\nclearly, by using a flat emitter surface, free-electron theory\nand several models for the tunneling barrier.\nWe use an arbitrary value (10214 m2) for the \u2018\u2018true emis-\nsion area\u2019\u2019 A true , and simulate FN-plot data using three mod-\nels, namely an elementary triangular ~ET! barrier, the stan-\ndard image-rounded \u2018\u2018Schottky\u2013Nordheim\u2019\u2019 ~SN! barrier,\nand a \u2018\u2018quadratically enhanced\u2019\u2019 ~QE! barrier discussed be-\nlow.\nThe resulting FN plots are then analyzed, as if experimen-\ntal data, using a linear regression program in the \u2018\u2018XGRACE\u2019\u2019\nsoftware package. This yields the slope S and intercept ln$R%\nof the FN plot, together with their standard errors. Since a\nFN plot is, in principle, slightly curved ~except for the ET\nbarrier!, these standard errors relate to the fitting of a straight\nline to well-defined data points lying on a slight curve. ~With\nreal experimental data, the standard errors would relate\npartly to experimental variability and measurement error.!\nThe values of R and S are then fed into spreadsheets de-\nveloped from the one described in Ref. 2. These spreadsheets\nimplement the iterative emission-area extraction procedure\nof Ref. 3, and yield an estimate Aest of emission area, to-\ngether with uncertainty limits. For experimental data, these\nlimits would relate to uncertainty about the emitter work-\nfunction and current-density values applicable to the experi-\nments. We pretend that an equivalent lack of knowledge ap-\nplies to our simulated data.\nEach spreadsheet uses a specific barrier model. Two\na!Electronic mail: r.forbes@surrey.ac.uk1222 J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 22\u00843\u0085, May\u00d5Jun 2004 1071-1023\u00d5200spreadsheets have been developed, based on the ET barrier\nand the SN barrier. One can then investigate how Aest com-\npares with A true , for various combinations of the barrier\nmodels used in the FN-plot simulations and the spreadsheet\nanalyses. The ratio Aest \/A true is a measure of the consistency\nof a simulation and analysis process, and should be close to\nunity if the process is self-consistent. We show in Sec. IV\nthat, if the models used in simulation and analysis are sig-\nnificantly different, then Aest \/A true can differ significantly\nfrom unity.\nAn alternative demonstration of this uses the single-step\narea-extraction procedure, based on Eq. ~11! below, that is\ndescribed in outline in Ref. 3. We discuss this in Sec. III.\nII. THEORY\nAll three barrier models used generate variants of the gen-\neralized ~phenomenological! FN equation introduced in Ref.\n3. This may be written as\nI5lAaf21F2 exp@2mbf3\/2\/F# , ~1!\nwhere f and F are the local work function and the barrier\nfield, a and b are the usual universal FN constants,3 A is\nemission area, and l and m are the generalized correction\nfactors introduced in Ref. 3. In FN coordinates, where\nln$I\/F2% is plotted against 1\/F , Eq. ~1! becomes\nln$I\/F2%5ln$lRel%1mSel\/F , ~2a!\nwhere\nRel[Aaf21, Sel[2bf3\/2. ~2b!\nThe parameter m is usually a function of F, so usually Eq.\n~2! represents a slightly curved line. Further ~except for plots\nassociated with the elementary triangular barrier!, it is\nknown that, as 1\/F reduces toward zero, a theoretical FN plot\nstops at the value 1\/Fb , where Fb is the barrier-field value at\nwhich m(F) ~and, hence, the barrier! becomes zero. The\nvalue of the \u2018\u2018constant\u2019\u2019 @ ln$lAaf21%# in Eq. ~2a! is thus\ngiven by the value of ln$I\/F2% at 1\/F51\/Fb , not by its value12224\u00d522\u00843\u0085\u00d51222\u00d55\u00d5$19.00 \u00a92004 American Vacuum Society\n1223 Forbes et al.: Extraction of emission area from Fowler\u2013Nordheim plots 1223at 1\/F50. However, an experimental plot will stop before\n1\/F reduces to 1\/Fb , because usually emitter melting or ex-\nplosion would intervene, so the value of ln$I\/Fb\n2% is difficult\nor impossible to identify from the FN plot.\nFor all these reasons, an experimental FN plot ~with its\nassociated regression line! is best modeled by a tangent to\nEq. ~2!. These tangents have the form\nln$I\/F2%5ln$R%1S\/F5ln$rRel%1sSel\/F , ~3!\nwhere ln$R% and S are the predicted intercept and slope of the\ntangent, and r([R\/Rel) and s([S\/Sel) are the correspond-\ning intercept and slope correction factors, given in terms of l\nand m by3\ns5m2Fdm\/dF , ~4a!\nr5l exp@Seldm\/dF# . ~4b!\nFrom Eqs. ~2b! and ~3!, it can be shown that\nRS25Aab2rs2f2[AC2G , ~5!\nwhere the universal constant C2@[ab2>7.192 489\n31013 A m22 eV2# , and the emission-area extraction func-\ntion G@[rs2f2# are defined by this equation. The param-\neters r and s vary with the point at which the tangent is\ntaken: r, s, and G are functions of f and F. Alternatively, and\nbetter, r, s, and G can be regarded as functions of f and the\nemission current density J.\nThe values of r, s, and G also depend on the emission\nmodel used. In particular, for the elementary FN theory, r\n5s51; for the standard FN theory, s is about 1 but r is of\norder 100.3\nFor the elementary and standard FN theories, parameter\nvalues can be calculated from conventional \u2018\u2018analytical\u2019\u2019\nformulas2,4 including ~for the standard FN theory! a\nformula2,5 for evaluating complete elliptic integrals that is\naccurate to two parts in 108.\nHowever, parameters for other models or barriers must be\ncalculated numerically. A simple option for any metal free-\nelectron theory is as follows.6 The probability D of electron\nescape through a barrier defined by the quasiclassical elec-\ntron potential energy V(x) can be written in terms of the\n\u2018\u2018Gamow exponent\u2019\u2019 G by\nD5exp@2G# . ~6a!\nIn the Jeffreys\u2013Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin approximation,7\nG is given by\nG5$~8m !1\/2\/\\P%E V1\/2dx , ~6b!\nwhere m is the free-space electron mass, \\P is Planck\u2019s con-\nstant divided by 2p rad, and $(8m)1\/2\/\\P% is a universal\nconstant ~for electrons! of value 10.246 34 eV21\/2 nm21.\nFor the ET barrier, one writes V5h2eFx , where h is the\nbarrier height and e is the elementary positive charge, and\nevaluates Eq. ~6b! analytically, obtaining\nG5Gel5bh3\/2\/F . ~7!JVST B - Microelectronics and Nanometer StructuresFor a more general barrier, one evaluates the JWKB inte-\ngral in Eq. ~6b! numerically and writes the result as G\n5nGel, where n is a correction factor defined by this equa-\ntion. The corresponding emission current is then evaluated\nfrom the \u2018\u2018general-barrier FN equation\u2019\u2019:6\nI5tF\n22Aaf21F2 exp@2nFbf3\/2\/F# , ~8a!\nwhere t is a correction factor defined by\nt5n1hdn\/dh , ~8b!\nand nF and tF are the values of n and t evaluated for h\n5f . Obviously, tF\n22 and nF are specific instances of the\nparameters l and m in Eq. ~1!.\nThe elementary FN theory can be derived from Eq. ~8! by\nputting t5n51, and the standard FN theory by substituting\nfor n and t the well-known special FE elliptic functions n\nand t.2,4 Our third model, involving a QE barrier was defined\nby writing\nVn5h2eFx2e2\/16pe0x1~eF\/at!x2, ~9!\nwhere e0 is the electric constant, and at is a parameter ~the\n\u2018\u2018tip radius\u2019\u2019! that was made equal to 10 nm. Values of emis-\nsion current I, as a function of field, were then evaluated for\nus by Koh and Yap as part of their BEng projects. They used\nEqs. ~6! to ~9! above and a program initially developed by\none of us ~J. H. B. D.!. These values provided the simulated\nFN plot for the QE barrier.\nWe note in passing that the precision of the integration\nprogram, estimated as about one part in 1015, is much better\nthan the precision of the usual formulas2,5 for the approxi-\nmate evaluation of complete elliptic integrals. So, it is more\nprecise to use the integration program for the SN barrier, too.\nIt thus seems likely that use of these elliptic-integral formu-\nlas, and the associated tiresome mathematics,2,4 may become\nobsolete in the context of FE.\nIII. ILLUSTRATION USING THE SINGLE-STEP\nFORMULA\nFor a simulated FN plot based on a chosen emission\nmodel and a chosen value A true of an emission area, and for\ngiven work-function and field values ~hence, known values\nof J and I!, we know the true values of emission area and of\nr, s, G, R, and S, and can rearrange Eq. ~5! as\nA true5RcSc\n2\/C2G true , ~10!\nwhere G true , Rc , and Sc are known correct values for the\nemission process responsible for the FN-plot data and for the\nf, J, and I values involved. @One would normally consider a\nfield ~and corresponding J and I values! near the middle\npoint of the data range, because a linear regression fit is best\nmodeled by a tangent to Eq. ~2! taken near this middle\npoint.#\nWith experimental data, or with simulated data where we\npretend we have no information other than the data points,\nwe are presented only with \u2018\u2018empirical\u2019\u2019 values (Re and Se)\nof R and S obtained by linear regression or manual line fit-\nting. There are then several difficulties that may prevent us\n1224 Forbes et al.: Extraction of emission area from Fowler\u2013Nordheim plots 1224from reliably extracting the emission area. ~1! We may not\nknow the true emission model. ~2! There may be uncertainty\nabout the relevant value of local work function f. ~3! Usu-\nally, we do not know to which current-density ~J! value ~\u2018\u2018in\nthe middle of the data range\u2019\u2019! the values Re and Se corre-\nspond. Also, if there is no reliable knowledge concerning\nemission area, then we cannot reliably convert measured cur-\nrent into true local current density J.\nTherefore, we seek to restrict the error ~in estimating the\nemission area! that results from uncertainty in f or J, by\nmaking an estimate Aest of the emission area from the for-\nmula\nAest5ReSe\n2\/C2Gmodel , ~11!\nand placing uncertainty limits on Gmodel . These limits are\nderived from calculations using the assumed emission model\nand assumptions about the possible ranges of f and J.\nFor example, consider analyzing FN plots from metals\nusing the standard FN theory. If we assume that 3.5<~f\/\neV!<6.5 and 105<(J\/A m22)<1012, then Ref. 3 shows that\nwe need to take Gmodel(5Gst)52000 eV2650%.\nExperimental data are usually measured\/reported as a\nfunction of voltage or macroscopic field, because the barrier\nfield is not easily measurable. The use of the product ReSe\n2 in\nEq. ~11! ensures that conversion factors or enhancement fac-\ntors drop out of the theoretical argument,3 certainly in regard\nto first-order effects. This means that normal experimental\ndata can be analyzed using the methods discussed here.\nHowever, for the present investigations, it is easier to use the\nbarrier field as the independent variable.\nThe above approach restricts the uncertainty about f and\nJ values, but does not deal with the uncertainty about the\nemission model. Consider, for simplicity, a hypothetical situ-\nation in which the correct emission model is a free-electron\nmodel based on the ET barrier, but the empirical data are\nanalyzed using the standard FN theory. As before, take the\nuncertainty in the work function as 3.5<~f\/eV!<6.5. For the\nelementary FN theory, r5s51, so from the definition of G\nvia Eq. ~5!, this range of f leads to the range 12\n<(Gel \/eV2)<42, and the \u2018\u2018correct\u2019\u2019 substitution into Eq.\n~11! should be Gmodel(5Gel)527 eV2655%. Clearly, if in-\nstead the analysis uses the \u2018\u2018incorrect\u2019\u2019 standard FN theory,\nwhich takes Gmodel(5Gst)52000 eV2650%, then this would\nproduce an emission-area estimate that is too small by a fac-\ntor of about 75.\nIV. ILLUSTRATION USING ITERATIVE\nPROCEDURES\nA. Methods\nThe uncertainties about f and J values, but particularly\nthose about J values, can be reduced by using an iterative\nprocedure as outlined in Ref. 3. This is based on knowing a\n\u2018\u2018typical midrange current\u2019\u2019 Imid for the experimental or\nsimulated FN-plot data. An assumption in the discussion in\nSec. III is that there is initial uncertainty by a factor of up to\n103.5 in our knowledge of J. This, and the uncertainty in f,J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B, Vol. 22, No. 3, May\u00d5Jun 2004lead ~for analyses using the standard FN theory! to an uncer-\ntainty of 650% in the estimated emission area. If we com-\nbine this result with the known current value Imid , using the\nformula J5Imid \/Aest , then ~much-tighter! limits on J are ob-\ntained, and these in turn yield a smaller uncertainty in Aest .\nThe process may be iterated until the result converges, usu-\nally after about five steps: The effect is to reduce the uncer-\ntainty in the area-estimate Aest .\nFor the standard FN theory, the iteration can be carried\nout using Table II in Ref. 3, but, in general, the iteration is\nbetter implemented via a spreadsheet similar to that dis-\ncussed in Ref. 2. This enables precise values of G to be\ncalculated for the four limiting pairs of (f ,J) values, using\nthe emission model embedded in the spreadsheet.\nAs already indicated, sets of simulated FN-plot data were\nprepared for three free-electron emission models, using ET,\nSN, and QE barrier models, taking in each case a \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019\nemission-area A true of 10214 m2. These sets were prepared\nfor each of three work-function values, namely 4 eV, 4.5 eV,\nand 5 eV.\nThese data sets were then analyzed using two spread-\nsheets, one with the elementary FN theory embedded in it,\none with the standard FN theory. Each dataset\/spreadsheet-\nanalysis combination leads to a mean emission-area estimate\nAest , and a consequent value of the ratio Aest \/A true . Values\nof these ratios are shown in Table I, for analyses using the\n\u2018\u2018standard\u2019\u2019 spreadsheet, and in Table II, for analyses using\nTABLE I. Mean values of the area ratio Aest \/A true , and associated uncertain-\nties, for simulated FN-plot data analyzed using the standard spreadsheet.\nThe upper error limits are associated with uncertainty relating to f and J;\nthe lower error limits ~if present! relate to the regression fit.\nFN-plot data\nsource\nf5\n4 eV 4.5 eV 5 eV\nElementary data 0.0089 0.011 0.013\n65.5% 65.5% 65%\nStandard data 0.42 0.49 0.56\n62.5% 62.1% 62.0%\n63.8% 64.6% 64.7%\nQE data 1.12 1.69 2.94\n61.5% 60.8% 60.8%\n612% 614% 618%\nTABLE II.

The first is the residual uncer-\ntainty associated with the iteration, after convergence has\noccurred, and relates to uncertainties in f and J. The second,\nwhere given, relates to regression fitting of a straight line to\n\u2018\u2018curved\u2019\u2019 data, and is the standard percentage error in (RS2),\nevaluated using conventional techniques but ignoring the\ncorrelation between the values of R and S.\nIn the iterations that led to Table I, no attempt was made\nto optimize the \u2018\u2018typical midrange emission current\u2019\u2019 Imid for\nthe data set being used. Imid is a changeable parameter in the\nspreadsheets, but was left unchanged at ~for historical rea-\nsons! a value of 0.192 mA. In comparison with other effects,\nresults were not expected to be sensitive to the value of Imid\n~but, see below!.\nIn Table II, the spreadsheet uncertainty derives solely\nfrom the arbitrary assumption made about the uncertainty in\na work function @3.5<~f\/eV!<6#, which is the same in all\ncases.\nB. Results and discussion\nThe central result that stands out from Tables I and II is\nthat, if there is a large difference between the emission model\nused in the simulation and the emission model used in the\nemission area extraction procedure, then the ratio Aest \/A true\ncan be significantly different from unity and, consequently,\nthere may be a serious error in the estimate of emission area.\nIn this context, the SN and QE barrier models are relatively\nclose to each other, and both are significantly different from\nthe ET barrier model. It is seen that the standard spreadsheet\nyields area ratios near unity for the SN and QE simulated\ndata, but ratios close to 0.01 for the ET simulated data. By\ncontrast, the elementary spreadsheet yields ratios close to\nunity for the ET simulated data, and ratios of between 50 and\n400 for the SN and QE simulated data.\nAlthough the SN and QE barrier models are relatively\nclose, the standard spreadsheet handles the SN data in a\nslightly more consistent manner than it does the QE data.\nTwo features of the stated error limits in Table I deserve\ncomment. First, the \u2018\u2018regression fitting\u2019\u2019 error component is\nnoticeably higher for the QE simulated data than for the SN\nsimulated data. This is because the FN plot of the QE simu-\nlated data is noticeably more curved than that of the SN\nsimulated data.8 This suggests the tentative possibility that, if\nerrors of experimental measurement could be kept very low\n~which is a big \u2018\u2018if\u2019\u2019!, and if there were no other distorting\nfactors, then something about the nature of the barrier\n~and\/or the size of the emitting object! might be learned from\nthe curvature of an experimental FN plot.\nSecond, when the SN simulated data is analyzed using the\nstandard spreadsheet, then one might hope that the resulting\nAest \/A true should be very close to 1. In fact, derived ratios are\naround 0.5. The combined error limit ~due to both sources of\nerror! is, however, typically about 67%. So, in statistical\nterms, the derived ratios are significantly different from 1.0JVST B - Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures~if the method of error estimation is adequate!. This implies\nthat the procedures described here are not completely self-\nconsistent, and suggests that some relatively small discrep-\nancy remains to be determined.\nFinally, we note that, in all cases, the ratio Aest \/A true in-\ncreases as the assumed work-function value increases. The\nreason for this is not currently understood, but might be as-\nsociated with the effect discussed next.\nV. INFLUENCE OF THE VALUE OF Imid\nWhen analyzing SN simulated data using the standard\nspreadsheet, it was noticed by two of us ~H. S. S. and N. H.!\nthat the derived value of Aest was slightly dependent on the\nvalue of Imid . More systematic exploration yielded results\nsuch as those in Table III, which relate to the f54.5 eV data\nset. Table III shows that, as Imid increases from 1.92\n31027 A to 0.192 A, Aest increases from 4.9310215 m2 to\n1.5310214 m2. Obviously, this range contains the \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019\nemission area 10214 m2.\nThe midrange current for the data set is about 5\n31024 A; from Table III, the corresponding emission area is\nabout 8310215 m2. The corresponding ratio value Aest \/A true\nnow becomes 0.8, rather than the 0.49 shown in Table I. This\nsuggests that we may have discovered the main cause of the\nresidual inconsistency remarked earlier in Table I. It suggests\n~not surprisingly! that, for self-consistency in the procedures\ndiscussed here, it is necessary to use in the spreadsheet an\nImid value corresponding to the actual midrange current of\nthe FN plot.\nVI. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS\nThe main conclusion to be drawn from this work is a\nstrong confirmation that, in the extraction of emission area\nfrom experimental FN plots, it is highly important to use an\nemission model that corresponds well to the actual emission\nphysics of the situation. This is not a new conclusion, but the\nsimulations here do seem to bring out the effect much more\nclearly than some previous work.\nAdmittedly, the difference between the \u2018\u2018real\u2019\u2019 barrier\nencountered in a FE process and the standard SN barrier\nmay be less extreme than the difference in the model ~be-\ntween the standard SN barrier and the ET barrier! that is\nresponsible for the numerical effects discussed here.

When using Eq. ~11!, the\nbest result is obtained if the G value used corresponds to a\ncurrent density in the midrange of the experimental data, and\n~2! when using an iterative procedure that relies on convert-\ning preliminary estimates of emission area to revised esti-\nmates of current density, it is best to use a \u2018\u2018typical current\u2019\u2019\nin the midrange of the experimental data. There is scope for\nfurther work to determine how best to choose these midrange\nvalues.\nThere also seems a ~remote! theoretical possibility that\ninteresting information might be derived from study of theJ.
