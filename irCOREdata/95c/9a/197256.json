An HPLC method for tricin was modified and validated to permit measurement of PMF in mouse plasma and intestinal mucosa. HPLC analysis was carried out on a Hypersil-BDS C18 column with detection at 324 nm and tricin as internal standard. The assay was linear in the range of 100\u20132000 ng\/mL plasma and 1.0\u201340 \u00b5g\/mL mucosa. PMF in plasma was efficiently extracted using solid-phase columns. In the case of mucosa organic solvent protein precipitation displayed satisfactory accuracy and precision. The assay recovery at low, medium and high concentrations was between 85 and 103% for both biomatrices, with a relative standard deviation of <15%. The lower limits of quantitation for plasma and mucosa were 100 ng\/mL and 1.0 \u00b5g\/mL, respectively.
