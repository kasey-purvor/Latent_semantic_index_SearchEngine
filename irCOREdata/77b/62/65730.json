We first of \nall look at the theoretical background to representations in mathematics. In \nparticular, we look at the use of the array representation for reasoning with and \nunderstanding multiplication. We then describe some preliminary work that we have \ncarried out, examining Year 4 and Year 6 pupils\u2019 use of the array representation for \nmultiplication calculations. Using a novel methodological approach of recording \nchildren\u2019s workings on a computer, we observed that the array representation can be \na powerful tool for supporting work in multiplication. At the same time, we also \nobserved pupils who were unable to access the mathematical meanings of the \nrepresentation. Further work is needed to understand such difficulties when \ndeveloping the use of the array as a tool for mathematical understanding. \nINTRODUCTION \nDuring primary education, pupils are introduced to a number of big ideas \u2013 for \nexample, addition and subtraction in early primary, and multiplication and division in \nlater primary. In teaching addition and subtraction, there has been a clear use of \nrepresentations such as number squares and number lines, with number lines being \nthe most appropriate representation for demonstrating the characteristics of these \noperations. In the renewed Primary Framework for mathematics in England and \nWales (DfES, 2006), teachers are encouraged to use the array representation for \nmultiplication when introducing pupils to the distributive law. However, how will \nchildren be expected to respond to this particular representation? This is the question \nthat we will explore in this paper. \nROLE OF REPRESENTATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL LEARNING \nResearchers such as Gray et al. (1997), Krutetskii (1976), Carpenter et al. (1999), \nGravemeijer (1991) and Thompson (1999) have all discussed the importance of \nrepresentations in developing mathematical competence. Representations in \nmathematics education refer to both internal and external manifestations of \nmathematical concepts. Hiebert and Carpenter (1992) state that communicating \nmathematical ideas requires external representations (so spoken language, written \nsymbols, pictures or physical objects), whereas to think about mathematical ideas \nrequires internal representations. Goldin and Shteingold (2001) also identified \ncomputer-based microworlds as external representations, and students\u2019 personal \nsymbols, their natural language, visual imagery, spatial representation and problem-\nsolving strategies and heuristics as internal representations. \nThere are a variety of ways in which external representations can be used in the \nlearning of mathematics. First of all, concrete representations can be used to \u2018mirror\u2019 \n 2 \nthe structure of a particular concept (Boulton-Lewis, 1998). In turn, they are easier to \ntalk about than language-based or symbol-based procedures, and also allow the \nteacher to access, to some degree, the cognitive processes of students (Hall, 1998). \nRepresentations can be used in problem solving situations to make sense of situations \nand to structure thinking and approaches to solutions (Fennell and Rowan, 2001).  \nGoldin and Shteingold\u2019s (2001) work on representations suggests that \nrepresentational systems are important to the learning of mathematics because of the \ninherent structure contained within each representation. This structure can shape or \nconstrain learning. Furthermore, different representations emphasise different aspects \nof a concept and so the development of an understanding of a particular concept \ncomes from having a range of representations and being able to move both within and \nbetween them. \nWe identify two important characteristics that are required by a representation, \nparticularly for the young learner: \n\u2022 consistency, both as we move from one operation to another and as the \nnumber domain extends through natural numbers, integers and rational \nnumbers. \n\u2022 transparency, so that the characteristics of the operation are clearly available \nfor the learner to visualise and use. \nHowever, Harries and Suggate (2006) suggested that representations are not self-\nevident, but they need to be worked on so that the essence of the representation is \nunderstood. As Mason (2005) has written: \nTo get much educational benefit, students need to be active in processing images; they \nneed to work on images, not just look at them. They need to probe beneath surface \nreactions. Working on and with mental imagery supports this development (p 78). \nKaput (1991) took the view that the way the learner understands notation and \nrepresentations determines the way in which mathematical thinking can develop. He \nsuggested that mathematical notation acts in a similar way to the architecture of a \nbuilding in that it constrains and\/or supports our experience. He maintained that the \nability to see links between different representations (both iconic and symbolic) is a \npowerful problem-solving tool, and he suggested that linking notational systems helps \npupils to extend their reasoning processes from concrete to more abstract systems \n(Kaput 1994): \nAll aspects of a complex idea cannot be adequately represented within a single notation \nsystem, and hence require multiple systems for their full expression (p 530). \nThese ideas from Mason and Kaput suggest that we need to explore ways in which \nyoung learners can explore representations and how this exploration may be a way in \nwhich understanding is developed. \n 3 \nUNDERSTANDING, REASONING AND REPRESENTATIONS \nThe previous discussion touched upon the fact that using representations can develop \nchildren\u2019s understanding of mathematics. Before we examine how we can represent \nmultiplication, let us consider in more depth the link between representations of \nmathematical concepts and how we come to understand these concepts. We begin by \nexamining some definitions or explanations of \u2018understanding\u2019 in mathematics. \nSkemp (1976) identified two types of understanding: relational and instrumental. He \ndescribed relational understanding as \u2018knowing both what to do and why\u2019 (p 2), and \nthe process of learning relational mathematics as \u2018building up a conceptual structure\u2019 \n(p 14). Instrumental understanding, on the other hand, was simply described as \u2018rules \nwithout reasons\u2019 (p 2). \nNickerson (1985), in examining what understanding is, identified some \u2018results\u2019 of \nunderstanding: for example, agreement with experts, being able to see deeper \ncharacteristics of a concept, looking for specific information in a situation more \nquickly, being able to represent situations, and envisioning a situation using mental \nmodels. However, he also proposed that \u2018understanding in everyday life is enhanced \nby the ability to build bridges between one conceptual domain and another\u2019 (p 229). \nLike Skemp, Nickerson highlighted the importance of knowledge and of relating \nknowledge:  \nThe more one knows about a subject, the better one understands it. The richer the \nconceptual context in which one can embed a new fact, the more one can be said to \nunderstand the fact (p 235-236).  \nHiebert and Carpenter (1992) specifically defined mathematical understanding as \ninvolving the building up of the conceptual \u2018context\u2019 or \u2018structure\u2019 mentioned above. \nThe mathematics is understood if its mental representation is part of a network of \nrepresentations. The degree of understanding is determined by the number and strength of \nits connections. A mathematical idea, procedure, or fact is understood thoroughly if it is \nlinked to existing networks with stronger or more numerous connections. (p 67) \nTherefore, this idea of understanding being a structure or network of internal \nmathematical ideas or representations comes out clearly from the literature.  \nIn discussing understanding, we have to be clear as to whether we are referring to \nunderstanding as an action or as a result of an action. Sierpinska (1994) clarified this \nby putting forward three different ways of looking at understanding. First of all, there \nis the \u2018act of understanding\u2019 which is the mental experience associated with linking \nwhat is to be understood with the \u2018basis\u2019 for that understanding. Examples of bases \ngiven by her were mental representations, mental models, and memories of past \nexperiences. Secondly, there is \u2018understanding\u2019 which is acquired as a result of the \nacts of understanding. Thirdly, there are the \u2018processes of understanding\u2019 which \ninvolve links being made between acts of understanding through reasoning processes, \nincluding developing explanations, learning by example, linking to previous \n 4 \nknowledge, linking to figures of speech and carrying out practical and intellectual \nactivities. Sierpinska (1994) saw these processes of understanding as \u2018cognitive \nactivity that takes place over longer periods of time\u2019 (p 2). In making links between \nunderstandings of a mathematical concept through reasoning, for example, showing \nwhy 12 \u00d7 9 gives the same answer as 9 \u00d7 12, we further develop our understanding of \nthe concept. This third process is important in that we can make the link between \nunderstanding and reasoning. We see reasoning as the process of linking between \ndifferent representations of a mathematical concept, internally or externally. In the \nabove example, we are using reasoning to link between 12 \u00d7 9 and 9 \u00d7 12. Thus, we \ncan use the following definitions for understanding and reasoning: \n\u2022 to understand mathematics is to make connections between mental (internal) \nrepresentations of a mathematical concept;  \n\u2022 to reason is to make connections between different representations (internal or \nexternal) of a mathematical concept, through formal (for example, logic, proof) \nor informal (for example, through examples) processes. \nWe can therefore see the close links between understanding and reasoning, and why, \nin establishing links through reasoning, we might develop understanding of \nmathematical concepts. We have also established some connection between the \ninternal representations that make up our understanding and the external \nrepresentations that we use to communicate mathematics. Going back to the ideas of \nMason and Kaput earlier, by encouraging children to explore and reason between \nrepresentations, what we are doing is providing the opportunity for understanding to \ndevelop. \nUSING REPRESENTATIONS TO ILLUSTRATE MULTIPLICATION \nIn thinking now about visual representations of multiplication, we can use the above \nideas about representations and reasoning, and relate these to aspects of \nmultiplication that we would like children to understand. \nNunes and Bryant (1996) stated that a commonly held view of multiplication and \ndivision is that they are simply \u2018different arithmetic operations \u2026 taught after they \nhave learned addition and subtraction\u2019 (p 144). However, they suggest that this is too \nlimited a view and that in actual fact \u2018multiplication and division represent a \nsignificant qualitative change in children\u2019s thinking\u2019 (p144). Whilst addition and \nsubtraction can be thought of as the joining of sets, multiplication is about replication. \nAnghileri (2000) concurs with these ideas and suggests that addition and subtraction \nare unary operations with each input representing the same kind of element \u2013 3 \nblocks added to 4 blocks or 3 oranges added to 4 oranges \u2013 and the second input \nbeing a means of identifying a termination point. However, she suggests that pupils \nneed to view multiplication as a binary operation with two distinctive inputs. The first \ninput represents the size of a set (say, the number of oranges in a particular set) and \nthe second represents the number of replications of that set (how many sets of \n 5 \noranges). In this way the two numbers represent distinct elements of the \nmultiplication process. \nThe important aspects of multiplication which are discussed by Anghileri (2000) \namongst others are: \n\u2022 replication (rather than joining as in addition\/subtraction); \n\u2022 the binary rather than unary nature of multiplication, and the notion of two \ndistinct and different inputs; \n\u2022 commutativity for multiplication but not division; \n\u2022 distributivity. \nWhen considering ways of representing multiplication visually, we need to consider \nhow the representation might both show the above characteristics and also aid the \ncalculation process. Wittmann (1998, 2002, and 2005) in his work on representations \nconsiders two aspects. First, he suggests that a representation needs to facilitate the \nprocesses of mathematising, exploring, reasoning, communicating. Second, he \nsuggests three criteria that need to be satisfied by a representation for a particular \ndomain of teaching: a limited and compatible set of representations should be used, \nthe representations should capture the fundamental ideas of the domain being \nconsidered, and they should be available in both large demonstration format and \nsmall personal use format. \nSome of the common representations applicable for multiplication are shown below, \nand to varying degrees they satisfy the aspects considered by Wittmann.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Plates of strawberries representation \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Number line representation \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Beads on a string representation \n 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Array representations 1 (left) and 2 (right) \nIn order to see how well the different representations highlight the important aspects \nof multiplication, we need to \u2018interrogate\u2019 the representations to see how easily we \ncan in particular reason these aspects, and therefore, we hope, come to understand \nthese aspects as part of multiplication. \nINTERROGATING REPRESENTATIONS OF MULTIPLICATION \nIf we explore the nature of these representations, then some points which might be \nidentified are: \n\u2022 all the representations clearly show the element of replication which is a key \naspect of multiplication; \n\u2022 there are two inputs in each representation \u2013 for example, plates and \nstrawberries or rows and columns; \n\u2022 the groupings in the different representations vary from \u2018platefuls\u2019 or a whole \ngroup, to a grouping in which 5 seems to be a key (for example, in array 2); \n\u2022 both the array representations show the commutative nature of multiplication \nthrough a transformation of the representation; \n\u2022 the distributive law is clearly shown in array 2, and can be shown in array 1; \n\u2022 all the representations aid calculation but in different ways. All the \nrepresentations encourage one-to-one counting and counting in groups. Only \nthe arrays can be used for calculations involving the distributive law.  \nGiven these identified features of the representations, we contend that in order to \nencourage pupils to develop their thinking about multiplication as a binary operation, \nthe array representation needs to be used, with rows and columns representing the \ntwo inputs. Also, the array representation is advantageous in that it a useful for \nshowing a number of properties concerning multiplication. It is clear that the array \nrepresentation shows the commutative property of multiplication (Anghileri, 2000). \nSwapping the \u20187\u2019 and the \u20186\u2019 in Figure 4 simply changes the orientation of the array \nthrough a transformation. Also, the representation (especially with the additional \nspaces inserted) makes clear why the distributive law applies to multiplication. 7 \u00d7 6 \n 7 \nis equal to 7 \u00d7 (5 + 1) or (5 + 2) \u00d7 (5 + 1). Thus, the 7 times table could be seen as the \n(5 + 2) times table in this case.  \nThe way in which the distributive law is illustrated through this representation \nprovides a link between what might be called informal methods and a written method \nof performing the multiplication calculation. The grid method is a natural extension \nof the method which can be employed using the particular array discussed above.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Linking the array representations with the grid method \nThus, this representation has the potential to show the nature of multiplication, \nillustrate the important features of the operation, and facilitate ways in which the \ncalculation can be implemented both informally and as a written method. By \nencouraging children to reason the above links based on this external representation, \nwe would hope that understanding can be developed in multiplication. For these \nreasons we would consider that the array as portrayed above is what Wittmann (2002) \ncalls a Substantial Learning Environment, since: \n\u2022 it demonstrates and represents the key elements of the concept of \nmultiplication and provides an environment for locating this concept; \n\u2022 it facilitates the exploration of ideas beyond just multiplication in that it allows \nthe demonstration\/exploration of the nature of commutativity and \ndistributivity. Further it is a rich focus for discussion about the nature of and \nthe process for calculating multiplication; \n\u2022 it is adaptable to classroom use either with or without ICT and it encourages \nflexible ways of performing calculations; \n\u2022 it has clear mathematical and pedagogical strengths and so is a rich \nenvironment for research \nEXAMINING PUPILS USE OF THE ARRAY REPRESENTATION \nHaving examined some of the theoretical issues involved, let us now look at two case \nstudies looking at children\u2019s use of the array representation. In these studies, the \nfocus was on the use of the array for calculating purposes. These case studies came \nfrom research that we carried out involving a Year 4 class and a Year 6 class in a \nprimary school in the North East of England. The classroom sessions were based \naround pairs of pupils using a Macromedia Flash computer program, incorporating \nthe array representation of multiplication. The reason we used a computer program \n5 1 \n5 \n2 \n 25  5 \n10 2 \n 8 \nfor children\u2019s work is that it enabled us to use a novel methodology for examining \nchildren\u2019s mathematics. During the working in pairs and using the Flash program to \ndo problems on the computer, all the actions carried out by the children on the \ncomputer were recorded using Camtasia recording software. As children were each \nwearing a headphones and microphone set, the dialogue of children as they worked \non the multiplication problems was also recorded along with their computer actions. \nTherefore, a rich amount of qualitative audiovisual data, showing the dynamic \nprocess of children using the array representation, was obtained. This therefore \nenabled us to observe pupils as they 'construct their mathematical ways of knowing \nas they interact with others' (Cobb et al, 1992, p 17) whilst they used the array \nrepresentation for multiplication. We provide here instances from the data that \nprovided some insight into how pupils were using the array representation. For each \nyear group, we make some general comments based on this preliminary study before \ngoing on to discuss one specific example in each case.  \nIn the Year 6 group there were twenty four pupils working in pairs. All had \nexperience of multiplication and knew many of their tables.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6: The array showing all multiplications up to 20 \u00d7 15 \n\u2022 For all pupils the diagram above did not pose any problems and they were all \nable to identify multiplication as \u2018rows\u2019 by \u2018columns\u2019. \n\u2022 Even when they knew the answer from memory they still seemed to take an \ninterest in devising methods to calculate the total number of coloured circles. \n\u2022 All pupils used the structure of the diagram to count in 25s, 5s and 1s as a \nmechanism for working out the answer. \n\u2022 Some pupils used a method of mentally moving rows of 5 in order to complete \nblocks of 25. \n\u2022 There was constant discussion about what they were doing and why. For \nexample, in the calculation 18 \u00d7 9, the pupils discussed how they could start \nfrom 18 \u00d7 10 and then take away the bottom row, that is, take away 5, 5, 5 and \n3. \n 9 \n\u2022 There was evidence of pupils using the commutative law in order that they \ncould show 14 \u00d7 18 on the diagram (which would not fit as 18 \u00d7 14). \n\u2022 There was some evidence (see below) of pupils being able to use the \ndistributive law. \nThe points made above are illustrated by the specific example below concerning the \nway in which James and Tom worked with the programme. \nJames and Tom (Year 6) \nJames and Tom were using a programme which asked them to do a multiplication \ncalculation using the array. The numbers were entered as rows and columns, and then \nwe were interested in how they would do the calculation. The two diagrams below \nillustrate the strategies used.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7: Screenshots from James and Tom\u2019s use of the array \nFirst of all, with encouragement from the teacher, the pupils focussed on the 25 block \nand used that as a starting point for counting, using the language \u2018that\u2019s five 5s\u2019, and \nsometimes using the pointer to indicate the block. Again with strong teacher input, \nthey filled in blank counters to make up another block of 25. For example, in the left-\nhand figure above, by moving one line of 5 down to the bottom of the array. Finally \nthey counted the rest as a 5 and four 2s. However in the second example, where there \nwas no teacher input, we saw what could be viewed as a more sophisticated and \nextendable strategy which used the distributive law. This time, the conversation went \nas follows: \nGot 100 \u2026 50, 50, 100. And then 4 times 5 equals 20. And another. 3 times 5 equals 15; \nand 3 times 4 is 12; so two 15s, 12, and two 20s, and 100. So that\u2019s 182. \nThis time, not necessarily intentionally, the pupils had calculated (5+5+4) \u00d7 (5+5+3) \nby taking appropriate sections of the array. Hence they were demonstrating the use of \nthe distributive law. \nThus for the Year 6 pupils, seeing multiplication within this array was not a problem. \nThey used their prior knowledge to identify the calculation required and used the \n 10 \narray structure to calculate the answer. It was an environment which encouraged them \nto talk about what they were doing and why they were doing it. \nIn the Year 4 group, there were again 24 pupils working in pairs but they had more \nlimited experience of multiplication and there was more variation in the way in which \nthey responded to the questions asked. For them: \n\u2022 The requirement to mathematise the idea of multiplication within the array \nrepresentation did sometimes cause difficulty, especially when they knew the \nanswer and so were trying to represent this \u2018answer\u2019 in terms of 10s and units, \nrather than \u2018so many equal groups of \u2026\u2019. \n\u2022 The environment again encouraged discussion about how the representation \nworked and the pupils explored ways in which the total number of coloured \ncounters could be efficiently counted. \n\u2022 There was limited evidence of the use of the commutative law or the \ndistributive law. \nSome of these points are illustrated by the work of Anna and Beth below. \nAnna and Beth (Year 4 pupils) \nAnna and Beth were using a program where we had asked them to use an \u2018L-shape\u2019 \nwith an array (see Figure 8 below) to do multiplication problems. The idea was to \nmove the bars at the right and bottom of the array until the L-shape \u2018captured\u2019 the \nrequired calculation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8: Screenshots from Anna and Beth\u2019s use of the array \nFirst of all, they were asked to do the problem 11 \u00d7 6. They knew the answer to be \n66. However, they then struggled for a few minutes in moving the L-shape so that \nonly 66 squares were enclosed. They did not associate the dimensions of \u201811\u2019 and \u20186\u2019 \nwith the dimensions of the required array. This was despite the fact that they had used \na similar program in a previous session, where they typed in the two numbers being \nmultiplied to produce an array of highlighted counters (see the Year 6 example). \nEventually, by accident, they placed the L-shape in the correct position and complete \nthe question by writing \u201811\u2019 for the number of rows, \u20186\u2019 for the number of columns, \nthen \u201866\u2019 for the answer. They then tried 14 \u00d7 7. They began by trying to calculate the \n 11 \nanswer first (incorrectly getting 104), then tried to show 104 on the array. They again \nmade no association between the array and the multiplication sum. After about eight \nminutes of moving the L-shape around the array, one of the researchers intervened. \nHere Anna and Beth are clearly struggling to use the environment to explore what the \ncalculation 11 \u00d7 6 would look like in this representation. The difficulty they have is \nmathematising within this structure which requires them to think in terms of rows and \ncolumns, rather than the answer in terms of tens and units. Nonetheless it provides a \nclear opportunity for discussion about multiplication. \nCONCLUSIONS \nOn the basis of this small preliminary study, the following points can be made. \nFirstly, the representation can provide a focus for discussion and reasoning of the \ncalculation being considered. Secondly, the array can provide a representation of \nmultiplication that not only emphasises the replication element of multiplication, but \ncan also be used to aid the calculation of the total. Thirdly, the pupils could be \nimaginative in their use of the array to calculate the total number of counters. They \nseemed to see it as a counting exercise and sought ways to make this exercise \nefficient, by using the 5 by 5 block as a kind of benchmark from which to work. \nThere is a sense, of course, in which this could be seen as a distraction since the \ncalculating exercise then loses the element of replication. Fourthly, the distributive \nelement of multiplication can be used to perform the calculation and this could be an \nimportant developmental point. \nHowever, we do need to be careful to examine how the pupils see the representation \nthemselves. As in the case of the Year 4 pupils, we cannot take for granted how the \nchildren will interpret the representation. Further work now needs to be undertaken to \ngain a better understanding of how pupils reason with a representation and in \nparticular how they make sense of the array in the context of multiplication: whether \nit encourages the development of informal strategies, whether it provides an \nimportant link to a more formal method such as the grid method, and whether it can \nbe used to represent a range of word problems. Also, more work will be required in \ntrying to develop a clear sense of progression within this field of representations and \nmultiplication. \nIn our discussion above, we have also examined the potential of reasoning with the \narray representation. From our observations, we conclude that this particular form of \nthe array has the potential for supporting reasoning in multiplication, but we have to \nbe aware of the problems as well. For example, the Year 4 pupils needed to realise \nthat the representation was not just showing a particular number but an operation as \nwell. This therefore placed a restriction on the way in which the representation should \nhave been reasoned with. Furthermore, the Year 6 pupils would need to be \nencouraged to think about methods that were extendable. More work now needs to be \ndone to explore the possibility of developing a pedagogy based on the idea of \nunderstanding through reasoning, using representation as the medium through which \n 12 \nthe reasoning can be focused. However, this paper has shown how we can use the \narray to reason, and therefore how we can possibly use it to develop understanding in \nmultiplication. \n \nREFERENCES \nAnghileri, J.
