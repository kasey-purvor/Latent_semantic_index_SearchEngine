We investigate an omega-band event that took\nplace above northern Scandinavia around 02:00\u201302:30 UT\non 9 March 1999. In our analysis we use ground based\nmagnetometer, optical and riometer measurements together\nwith satellite based optical images. The optical and riome-\nter data are used to estimate the ionospheric Hall and Peder-\nsen conductances, while ionospheric equivalent currents are\nobtained from the magnetometer measurements. These data\nsets are used as input in a local KRM calculation, which gives\nthe ionospheric potential electric field as output, thus giving\nus a complete picture of the ionospheric electrodynamic state\nduring the omega-band event.\nThe overall structure of the electric field and field-aligned\ncurrent (FAC) provided by the local KRM method are in\ngood agreement with previous studies. Also the E\u00d7B drift\nvelocity calculated from the local KRM solution is in good\nqualitative agreement with the plasma velocity measured by\nthe Finnish CUTLASS radar, giving further support for the\nnew local KRM method. The high-resolution conductance\nestimates allow us to discern the detailed structure of the\nomega-band current system. The highest Hall and Pedersen\nconductances, \u223c50 and \u223c25 S, respectively, are found at the\nedges of the bright auroral tongue. Inside the tongue, con-\nductances are somewhat smaller, but still significantly higher\nthan typical background values. The electric field shows a\nconverging pattern around the tongues, and the field strength\ndrops from \u223c40 mV\/m found at optically dark regions to\n\u223c10 mV\/m inside the areas of enhanced conductivity. Down-\nward FAC flow in the dark regions, while upward currents\nflow inside the auroral tongue. Additionally, sharp conduc-\ntance gradients at the edge of an auroral tongue are associated\nwith narrow strips of intense FACs, so that a strip of down-\nCorrespondence to: H. Vanhama\u00a8ki\n(heikki.vanhamaki@fmi.fi)\nward current flows at the eastern (leading) edge and a similar\nstrip of upward current is present at the western (trailing)\nedge. The Joule heating follows the electric field pattern, so\nthat it is diminished inside the bright auroral tongue.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Electric fields\nand currents)\n1 Introduction\nOmega-bands are meso-scale (usually 400\u20131000 km) undu-\nlations in the poleward boundary of diffuse auroras. They\ntypically appear in the morning sector of the auroral oval and\nduring the recovery phase of auroral substorms. The east-\nward propagating auroral tongues interleaved with dark re-\ngions resemble the Greek letter , which has given the name\nfor this quasi-periodic phenomenon.\nThe ionospheric electrodynamics of omega-bands has\nbeen studied in several papers (see e.g. Wild et al., 2000;\nAmm et al., 2005, and references therein), which all sup-\nport the overall picture of a sequence of upward and down-\nward field-aligned currents (FACs) located in the bright and\ndark regions of the structure, respectively. As the band struc-\nture with its relatively stationary current system moves above\nground-based magnetometers, Ps6 type magnetic pulsations\n(period 4\u201340 min) are observed. The typical eastward drift\nvelocity of omega-bands varies between 0.4\u20132 km\/s.\nThe magnetospheric processes causing the field aligned\ncurrent (FAC) system of omega-bands has also been ad-\ndressed in several papers, but the general consensus about\nthe primary source is still missing. Opgenoorth et al. (1994)\nassociate omega-bands with energetic particle precipitation\nin the morning sector and suggest that both these phenomena\nhave their origin at the outer edge of the ring current region.\nIn the simulation of Yamamoto et al. (1997) diffuse auroras\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3368 H. Vanhama\u00a8ki et al.: Electrodynamics of an omega-band\nare associated with a torus of hot plasma in the near-Earth\nmagnetosphere and omega-bands are caused by the electro-\nstatic interchange instability which can grow at the poleward\n(tailward) edge of the torus region during the substorm recov-\nery phase. The 2-dimensional MHD-simulation runs by Jan-\nhunen and Huuskonen (1993) suggest that also the Kelvin-\nHelmholtz instability can cause some structures in the mag-\nnetic vorticity and FACs which resemble omega-bands.\nIn the omega-band cases analysed by Opgenoorth et al.\n(1983) and Amm (1996) the patterns of the converging (di-\nverging) electric field within the auroral (dark) -regions\nare symmetric with respect to the vertical central axis of the\ntongue. Consequently, the superposition of omega-band and\nthe morning sector electrojet appears as periodic undulations\nin the direction of horizontal total current. In a more re-\ncent case study presented by Amm et al. (2005) the effect\nis clearly different: In the presence of an omega-band the\nwestward electrojet gets (partially) interrupted by alternat-\ning sheets of upward and downward FACs. The structure of\nelectric field is a crucial factor to cause this behaviour. The\nfield is not symmetric at the flanks of the auroral tongue, but\nhas clearly smaller deviation in the East-West direction at the\nwestward flank than in the eastward flank.\nIn the above described studies the magnetic and electric\nfield observations have been used as the primary input data.\nOptical data have been used as reference information for\nmapping the deduced current and field structures against the\nvisual structures. In the method of characteristics (e.g. Amm\net al., 2005) optical data can also be used to estimate the Hall\nto Pedersen conductance ratio. In the present study we will\nrevisit the omega-band electrodynamics once again with a\nmethod that uses magnetic, optical and riometer data as in-\nput for the calculation of electric fields and currents. Our\nprocedure is a variant of the widely known KRM-method\n(Kamide et al., 1981), which has been modified by Van-\nhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007) for meso-scale analysis. We also\nutilize some semi-empirical models connecting observations\nof auroral luminosity and riometer absorption with height in-\ntegrated conductance values (Senior et al., 2008).\nThe purpose of this paper is two-fold: Firstly, we want to\npresent the first case study where the local KRM technique\ndeveloped by Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007) is applied to real\ndata. This demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of\nthe new analysis method, e.g. in respect to input data require-\nments. Secondly, we want to verify the reliability of the lo-\ncal KRM method against direct electric field measurements.\nVanhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007) verified the new method using\nsynthetic examples of typical ionospheric current systems,\nbut in this study we compare the calculated electric field with\ndirect measurements done by a coherent scatter radar.\nIn Sects. 2 and 3 we introduce our data analysis methods\nand the input data in more detail. Section 4 describes our\nevent (9 March 1999, around 02:00 UT) and Sect. 5 shows\nthe results from its analysis. The main findings of this study\nare discussed and summarised in Sect. 6.\n2 Data and analysis methods\n2.1 Ionospheric equivalent currents\nWe use magnetic data from the IMAGE magnetometer net-\nwork, shown in Fig. 1. The ground magnetic measurements\nare converted into ionospheric equivalent currents with the\nSECS method, introduced by Amm and Viljanen (1999) and\ncarefully tested by Pulkkinen et al. (2003). The background\nmagnetic field is almost vertical in the area of the IMAGE\nnetwork (inclination is \u223c73\u25e6 in the southern parts), so we\nmay assume that the equivalent currents are equal to the\ndivergence-free part of the true ionospheric current (see e.g.\nSect. 2.4.2 of Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993).\nOur analysis area is located at the northern mainland part\nof the IMAGE network, where the magnetometer network is\ndensest. Consequently, we are able to calculate the equiva-\nlent current with spatial resolution of 0.4\u25e6 in latitude and 1.0\u25e6\nin longitude. This corresponds to a 45\u00d740 km grid at latitude\n69\u25e6 N. The temporal resolution of the magnetic data is 10 s.\nIt should be noted that we have not separated the ground\nmagnetic field into internal and external parts. During mag-\nnetically active periods significant part of the ground mag-\nnetic disturbance may be caused by internal induced currents\n(up to 40% during substorm onset, Tanskanen et al., 2001).\nHowever, the internal part of the magnetic field is gener-\nally much smoother than the external part. This means that\nour estimates of the ionospheric equivalent current may have\nslightly too large magnitude, but the spatial structure should\nbe correct.\n2.2 \u201cEnergy map\u201d conductance estimates\nKosch et al. (2001) introduced a method to derive maps\nof the characteristic energy of precipitating electrons from\ncosmic noise absorption (CNA) and auroral optical inten-\nsity at 557.7 nm. Senior et al. (2008) extended this \u201cenergy\nmap\u201d method so that also the flux of the precipitating elec-\ntrons can be determined, assuming that the electrons have a\nMaxwellian energy spectrum. When both the characteristic\nenergy and total energy flux of the precipitation are known,\nthe ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductances can be cal-\nculated by using the Robinson formulae (Robinson et al.,\n1987). These conductance estimates will be referred to as\n\u201cemap\u201d estimates.\nIn this study we use CNA measured by the IRIS imaging\nriometer (Browne at al., 1995) located at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL\nin Fig. 1) and intensity-calibrated optical images from the\nDigital All-Sky Imager (DASI, Kosch et al., 1998) located\nat Skibotn (roughly between KIL and TRO in Fig. 1). The\nconductance estimates have high temporal (10 s) resolution\nin the area of 220\u00d7220 km over the IRIS and DASI instru-\nments. There are some time-steps when the emap estimate\nis not available for the whole analysis area. This is caused\nby the inherent uncertainty in estimating the quiet-day noise\nAnn.

The emap estimate is given in a\n10\u00d710 km grid, but the true spatial resolution of the estimate\nis variable, mainly due to the IRIS CNA measurements. IRIS\nhas about 18 km resolution near the zenith over Kilpisja\u00a8rvi,\nbut the resolution decreases with increasing distance from the\nzenith. The DASI optical data are stored at 10 km resolution,\nand in the energy-map calculations the CNA measurements\nare interpolated onto the same 10 km grid.\nSenior et al. (2008) compared the emap estimates and two\nother methods of determining conductances using riometer\nor optical data against EISCAT incoherent scatter radar mea-\nsurements for two separate events. They found that for this\nparticular event (9 March 1999) the DASI auroral 557.7 nm\nintensity values had to be scaled by a factor of 2.8 in order to\nmatch the EISCAT conductance measurement. The reason\nfor this scaling is unclear, but possibly it was a calibration\nproblem with the DASI instrument at this time. Senior et al.\n(2008) concluded that the emap method gave the best Hall\nconductance estimates (correlation 0.97\u20130.98 with EISCAT\nmeasurement), while the Pedersen conductance estimates ob-\ntained with the emap method were only slightly worse (cor-\nrelation 0.88\u20130.90). During the studied intervals the EIS-\nCAT measurements were available mostly in the magnetic\nfield aligned direction, but Senior et al.

Geophys., 27, 3367\u20133385, 2009\n3370 H. Vanhama\u00a8ki et al.: Electrodynamics of an omega-band\n2.3 UVI conductance estimates\nThe Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI) instrument onboard the PO-\nLAR spacecraft measures the auroral UV emission within\nthe Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band at 140\u2013180 nm. Ger-\nmany et al. (1997, 1998a,b) describe the method used to esti-\nmate the ionospheric conductances. Here we give just a brief\noutline.\nThe LBH band is divided into short and long wavelength\nparts, LBHS at 140\u2013160 nm and LBHL at 160\u2013180 nm, re-\nspectively. At altitudes below \u223c150 km, emission in the\nLBHS band experiences larger absorption due to atmospheric\nO2. Thus the ratio between the LBHS and LBHL intensities\ndepends on the altitude of the UV emission and can be used\nto estimate the characteristic energy of the precipitating elec-\ntrons. The longer wavelength emission in the LBHL band\nis not significantly absorbed and is used to estimate the to-\ntal precipitating energy flux in the energy range 0.1\u201320 keV.\nThe ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conductances can be cal-\nculated by using the Robinson formulae (Robinson et al.,\n1987). These conductance estimates are will be referred to\nas \u201cUVI\u201d estimates.\nThe nominal spatial resolution of the UVI instrument is\n\u223c40 km at apogee, but due to wobbling of the POLAR de-\nspun platform the resolution is reduced to \u223c360 km in one\ndirection. The temporal resolution of the UVI conductance\nestimate (the time required to take both LBHS and LBHL\nimages) is 184 s for this specific event.\nAksnes et al. (2002) have shown that conductance esti-\nmates derived from only UVI data may underestimate the\nHall conductance by several tens of percent. This is caused\nby the limited sensitivity to precipitating electrons with ener-\ngies over 20 keV, which contribute to the Hall conductance.\nMost of the Pedersen conductance is caused by lower energy\nelectrons and therefore the uncertainty in 6P is significantly\nsmaller.\n2.4 Electric field measurements\nOur analysis area is situated within the field of view of the\nSTARE coherent scatter radar system (see e.g. Nielsen et al.,\n1999). STARE was still in operation during the event (it was\ndecommissioned in 2005), but unfortunately there are no us-\nable data for this period.\nAlso the CUTLASS coherent scatter radar system (see e.g.\nLester et al., 2004) operates in this area. CUTLASS con-\nsists of two separate radars, one in Finland and the other\nin Iceland, that have an overlapping field-of-view. During\nthe omega-band event only the Finnish radar received iono-\nspheric backscatter from our analysis area. This means that\nwe measure only the line-of-sight component of the plasma\nvelocity, as seen from the Finnish radar.\nDuring this event the CUTLASS radar operated in stan-\ndard scan mode, meaning that the spatial resolution along\neach radar beam is 45 km and the whole field-of-view is\nscanned every 2 min. Each radar beam is integrated for 7 s,\nbeginning from the westernmost beam. In Sect. 5.3 we com-\npare the E\u00d7B drift velocity calculated from the KRM elec-\ntric field (see Sect. 3.1) against the line-of-sight radar mea-\nsurement.\n3 Calculating the ionospheric electric field\n3.1 Local KRM method\nThe ionospheric electric field can be calculated with the local\nKRM method introduced by Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007),\nusing the equivalent currents and conductance estimates as\ninput data. The local KRM method uses the same input data\nas the traditional KRM method introduced by Kamide et al.\n(1981), but the mathematical formulation is quite different.\nThe traditional KRM method can be used only in global (or\nhemispherical) studies, because in local scale studies the un-\nknown boundary conditions at the edges of the analysis area\nmay cause large uncertainty in the solution (Murison et al.,\n1985). The new method developed by Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm\n(2007) overcomes this difficulty by the different mathemati-\ncal approach. In the meso-scale test cases considered by Van-\nhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007) the new local KRM method gave\nmuch more reliable results than the traditional KRM method.\nIt should be noted that in the local KRM method the iono-\nspheric electric field is assumed to be a potential field, which\nmeans that inductive effects are neglected. Vanhama\u00a8ki et al.\n(2007) showed that inductive effects may be locally impor-\ntant in some dynamical auroral systems. Their analysis in-\ncluded a data-based model of an omega-band (constructed\nby Amm, 1996), and the results indicated that in some rel-\natively small (<100 km) \u201chot-spots\u201d the induced rotational\nfield may contribute up to \u223c25% of the total electric field.\nHowever, when considered over the whole analysis area the\ninductive effect should be smaller than 1%.\nThe local KRM formulation presented by Vanhama\u00a8ki and\nAmm (2007) makes use of Cartesian geometry. This is\na very reasonable approximation in the emap data area of\n220\u00d7220 km. With the UVI conductance estimates we cal-\nculate the ionospheric electric field at area 66\u25e6\u201372\u25e6 N, 16\u25e6\u2013\n30\u25e6 E, which correspond to about 700\u00d7600 km. Even in this\nlarger area the curvature of the Earth may be neglected quite\nsafely. It should be noted that in principle the local KRM\nmethod may also be formulated in spherical geometry, as in-\ndicated by Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007), enabling study of\nlarger scale current systems.\nVanhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007) tested the local KRM method\nusing several realistic, data-based models of typical auroral\ncurrent systems, including an electrojet, westward travelling\nsurge and omega-band. Although the local KRM method\nperformed better than the previous analysis methods, the er-\nrors in the solution were not too small. For example, in\nthe omega-band case the local KRM method had 43% error\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3367\u20133385, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3367\/2009\/\nH.

Example of the original emap conductance data for one time step (panels on the right). In order to be used in the local KRM method\nthe conductance data is extrapolated to a larger grid and smoothed to match the spatial resolution of the equivalent current data (panels on\nthe left).\n(using the error definition of Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm, 2007)\nin the electric field. However, Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm (2007)\nconcluded that the overall structure of the solution, e.g. the\ngeneral locations of upward and downward FAC, was quite\nreliable even if the exact numerical values were questionable.\nWe recommend that the same precaution is used when inter-\npreting the results shown in Sect. 5.\nIn the present study some additional caution should be\nused, when interpreting the KRM results obtained using the\nemap conductance estimates. The reason is that the emap\nconductance estimate has much better spatial resolution than\nthe J eq data (see Table 1), and consequently it contains more\nsmall scale structures. In the local KRM method this dis-\ncrepancy, where small scale conductance gradients are not\nmatched with changes in equivalent current, may result in\nspurious small scale structures in the FAC and, to a lesser ex-\ntent, also in the electric field. This happens because the elec-\ntric field is partially limited by the condition that it must be\ncurl-free, but the FAC pattern, together with associated curl-\nfree horizontal current, is the free parameter that is adjusted\nso that Ohm\u2019s law, ground magnetic observations and condi-\ntion\u2207\u00d7E=0 are satisfied. We try to mitigate the situation by\naveraging the emap conductance estimate so that it matches\nthe resolution of J eq data more closely, as discussed in the\nnext section. However, some differences remain and the FAC\nresults displayed in Sect. 5 may contain some artificial fea-\ntures.\n3.2 Data processing\nWe will apply the local KRM method to two data sets: 1) The\nlarge scale structure of the omega-band is obtained by using\nground-based equivalent current J eq and the UVI conduc-\ntance estimate as input data, while 2) the small scale structure\nis obtained by combining J eq with emap conductance esti-\nmate. These data sets have very different native spatial and\ntemporal resolutions, as summarized in Table 1. It should\nbe further noted that during this event the POLAR space-\ncraft was near apogee and Scandinavia was near the limb of\nthe area visible to UVI, so the spatial resolution given in the\ntable may be optimistic (see http:\/\/uvi.nsstc.nasa.gov\/ for on-\nline images).\nThe equivalent current data and emap conductance esti-\nmates are calculated in geographical coordinate system, but\nthe UVI conductance estimate is given in apex geomag-\nnetic coordinates (Richmond, 1995). When we transform\nthe UVI data to the geographical coordinate system we as-\nsume that the difference between apex coordinates and alti-\ntude adjusted corrected geomagnetic coordinates (AACGM,\nBaker and Wing, 1998) is negligible. Gasda and Richmond\n(1998) noticed that at auroral latitudes (68\u25e6 MLAT), the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3367\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3367\u20133385, 2009\n3372 H.

Eastward\ncurrent is positive and the black line is the zero-current contour.\nmaximum difference between the apex magnetic latitude at\n110 km and corrected geomagnetic latitude at ground level\nis 0.17\u25e6, which is smaller than the UVI resolution. The UVI\ndata are integrated for 184 s, while the equivalent current data\nhas time resolution of 10 s. In the KRM calculation we sim-\nply took the instantaneous equivalent currents at the middle\npoint of the UVI integration period, without averaging J eq\nin time.\nIn order to make full use of the equivalent current data in\nthe large scale KRM calculation, the UVI conductance esti-\nmate is interpolated to the denser J eq grid (see Table 1). In\nthe latitudinal direction the UVI resolution is already close\nto that of J eq data, but in the longitudinal direction the UVI\nconductance estimate is heavily interpolated. This means\nthat UVI data underestimate the amount spatial structure, es-\npecially in the longitudinal direction where the real UVI res-\nolution is comparable to the size of individual -tongues.\nAs a result, most of the electric field and FAC structure in the\nlarge scale KRM calculation, where UVI-based conductance\ndata is used, stem from the equivalent current data. In this\ncase the KRM algorithm does not generate artificial struc-\nture as happens in the opposite case where conductance data\nhas more spatial structure than the equivalent current (see\ndiscussion of emap conductance data below).\nAlso the emap conductance estimate used in the more de-\ntailed small scale KRM calculation is processed, as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 2. The emap estimate is given in a 21\u00d723\ncell grid, with \u223c10 km resolution. Due to the shape of the\nIRIS field-of-view the conductance estimate is not available\nin some grid cells at the corners of the area. The present\nversion of the local KRM algorithm requires a regular rect-\nangular grid, so we extrapolated the missing values using\nthe nearest cells. Furthermore, in order to minimize possi-\nble boundary effects in the local KRM calculation, we ex-\ntrapolated the conductance data 4 grid points (\u223c40 km) out-\nwards in all directions. The local KRM calculations were\nperformed in this larger 29\u00d731 cell grid, but the results are\nshown only for the original area. Those time steps where\nany part of the emap conductance estimate is unavailable (see\nSect. 2.2) were omitted from the analysis.\nThe emap conductance data has\u223c10 km spatial resolution,\ncompared with the \u223c50 km resolution of the equivalent cur-\nrent data. In this case we found that simply interpolating\nJ eq to the denser grid produced unrealistic results in the lo-\ncal KRM method. Apparently the local KRM method does\nnot work reliably when the conductance data has more small\nscale structure than the J eq data, although in the opposite\ncase (with UVI data) it seems to work quite well. Conse-\nquently, in addition to interpolating the J eq data to the emap\ngrid, we also smoothed the emap conductance data by tak-\ning running 5-cell (about 50 km) spatial averages. This way\nboth data sets have roughly the same spatial resolution, and\nthere is also a sufficiently large number of grid points in the\ncalculation area. However, even after the averaging the emap\nconductance data has more small scale structure than the J eq\ndata, which results in spurious small scale structures in the\nFAC results displayed in Sect. 5. We try to identify these\nspurious features when discussing the results.\n4 Description of the event\nThe early morning hours of 9 March 1999 were magnetically\nactive since the recovery phase of a moderate substorm (AE\n\u223c700 nT) was going on. The first onset of the substorm took\nplace in the Fennoscandian sector around 21:00 UT (MLT\n\u2248UT+2.5) on 8 March. Inspection of the AE-index (data not\nshown here) reveals that in global scale the first onset of this\nsubstorm took place already around 19:30 UT. In the latitude-\nversus-time plot of equivalent currents (Fig. 3) the onset at\n21:00 UT is visible as a sudden intensification and poleward\nAnn.

After 21:30 UT the currents\nstarted to drift slowly equatorward which typically happens\nduring growth phase but in this case the drift was only tem-\nporary and local as the next stronger onset took place at\n22:00 UT. This second intensification propagated more pole-\nwards than the first one and reached also the IMAGE stations\nin Svalbard (magnetic latitude\u223c75\u25e6). After 23:00 UT the re-\ncovery phase started, and consequently the westward electro-\njet weakened and narrowed. The electrojet activity woke up\nagain at the arrival of the omega-band around 01:45 UT and\nthe current fluctuations lasted until 03:00 UT. The IMAGE\nmagnetograms in Fig. 4 show Pc6-type activity during this\nperiod, with at least two wave periods clearly discernible in\nall three magnetic field components. The amplitude of the\npulsations (\u2264400 nT) is larger in the Z and Y components\nthan in the X component (X not shown).\nAll-Sky Camera observations from station KIL (see Fig. 1)\nreveal that the auroral tongues in our omega-band event were\nnot similar with each other. The sky was partly cloudy above\nKIL until 01:40 UT but after that the visibility improved so\nmuch that the first -tongue is clearly visible in the KIL\nASC-images taken during 01:45\u201302:10 UT (data not shown\nhere). The first auroral tongue was very large and had rich\ninternal structure. In fact the electrojet behaviour (see Fig. 3)\nduring the passage of the tongue contains some features typ-\nical for substorm onset intensifications: strong poleward ex-\npansion of the electrojet region and eastward equivalent cur-\nrents in the southern stations (OUJ, HAN, NUR) simultane-\nously with the westward electrojet intensification. However,\nthe UVI images do not show a global expansion phase during\nthis time, so we interpret it as a pseudo-breakup that occurred\nsimultaneously with the omega-band event.\nIt is interesting to note that after the pseudo-breakup the\nomega-band activity continued as if nothing special had hap-\npened. The second large auroral tongue drifted above KIL\nduring 02:15\u201302:35 UT. This is covered in the ASC im-\nages shown in Fig. 5 and is more carefully analyzed in\nSect. 5. The drift speed inferred from the ASC images was\naround 1.2 km\/s, in the typical range for omega-bands.

Additionally, also the auroral intensity at 557 nm is shown in the middle left panel (cameras at ABK and\nKEV stations in Fig. 1, intensity is uncalibrated so no scale is shown). Here we use the UVI conductance estimate. The smaller area where\nthe emap conductance estimate is available is indicated by the red rectangle in the top left panel.\nThe electric field obtained from the large scale KRM\ncalculation shows a clear converging pattern on the east-\nward, northward and westward sides of the bright auroral\ntongue, which is typical for the omega-band (e.g. Untiedt\nand Baumjohann, 1993). The magnitude of E is around 40\u2013\n50 mV\/m in the dark regions of the omega-band, but drops\ndown to 10\u201320 mV\/m within the tongue.

The Hall and Pedersen conductance es-\ntimates derived from UVI data do show enhancement by a\nfactor \u223c2 in the general area of the omega-band. However,\none would expect to see enhanced conductances in the up-\nward FAC region and clearly diminished conductances in ar-\neas of strong downward FAC, but this is not the case in Fig. 6.\nMoreover, the areas of enhanced Hall and Pedersen conduc-\ntances are not completely overlapping, especially in the re-\ngion 70\u25e6\u201372\u25e6 N. These inconsistencies may be explained by\nthe limited spatial resolution of the UVI instrument (espe-\ncially in the longitudinal direction, see Table 1) and by the\nfact that the analysis area was near the limb of UVI image.\nHowever, the general structure of the omega-band seems to\nappear quite well in these results, indicating that in this case\nmost of the electric field and FAC structure seen in the KRM\nresults stems from the equivalent current data.\nThe current system of the omega-band is superposed on\ntop of a westward electrojet, and the equivalent current shows\nsinusoidal undulations around the bright and dark areas of the\nomega-band. The FAC shows alternating regions of upward\nand downward currents, so that upward current is located at\nthe bright tongue of the omega-band and downward currents\nflow in the dark area between the tongues. As a result, the\ntrue horizontal current density (shown as white arrows in the\nbottom right panel of Fig. 6) does not undulate as strongly\nas the equivalent current, but rather the westward current in-\ntensifies and diminishes alternatingly. However, in this event\nthe interruption of the westward electrojet is not as strong as\nin the event studied by Amm et al. (2005).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3367\/2009\/ Ann.

Similar to Fig. 6, but here we use the emap conductance estimate and time is 02:14:00 UT. Here the auroral 557 nm intensity is from\nKilpisja\u00a8vi station, corresponding to Fig. 5. The area shown in this figure is indicated by the red rectangle in the top left panel of Fig. 6.\n5.2 Small scale structure with emap conductance\nestimate\nFigures 7\u201310 show the more detailed view of omega-band\nelectrodynamics obtained using the emap conductance esti-\nmate in the local KRM method. These snapshots cover the\npassage of the second bright auroral tongue over the emap\nobservational area (see Fig. 6 for comparison with UVI data).\nIn Fig. 7 at 02:14 UT the analysis area is situated almost\ncompletely in the dark region between the first and second\ntongues. In the next figure, Fig. 8 at 02:18 UT the second\ntongue covers the western part of the area and in Fig. 9 at\n02:22 UT the tongue has moved eastward to cover the whole\nanalysis area. Finally in Fig. 10 the trailing edge of the\ntongue enters the analysis region, so that the North-West cor-\nner of the area is already in the dark region.\nThe more detailed view given in Figs. 7\u201310 supports the\noverall picture of omega-band electrodynamics presented in\nprevious studies and also in Fig. 6 using the larger scale UVI\ndata set. The Hall and Pedersen conductances are enhanced\nin the bright auroral tongue, while the electric field shows\na converging pattern around the tongue. Largest downward\nFAC flow in the dark regions (see Figs. 7 and 10) and upward\nFACS flow inside the auroral tongue (Fig. 9).\nAs discussed in Sect. 3, the emap conductance estimate\nhas better spatial resolution than the equivalent current data,\nwhich may lead to spurious small scale structures in the out-\nput of the local KRM method, especially in the FAC distribu-\ntion. For example, the rather small regions of intense down-\nward FAC near the North-West corners of the analysis area\nin Figs. 7 and 10 are somewhat suspicious. These \u201cblobs\u201d\nof downward FAC are situated in the dark low-conductance\nareas, which is natural enough, but in both cases the down-\nward FAC is associated with rather local conductance gradi-\nents that are not connected to the larger scale structure. Addi-\ntionally, distinct features near the edges of the analysis area,\nsuch as the small patch of downward FAC in the North-East\ncorner of Fig. 8, should be interpreted with caution, as they\nmay be spurious features produced by boundary effects or\nextrapolation of the conductance estimates.\nDespite the above cautions, there are some things we can\nsay about the internal structure of the omega-band. The con-\nductance gradient around the auroral tongue seem to be very\nsharp, as is evident in Figs. 8 and 10. It also appears that the\nlargest Hall and Pedersen conductances occur at the edges of\nthe auroral tongue. The Pedersen conductance shows a local\nminimum inside the tongue (see Fig. 9) and enhancement at\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3367\u20133385, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3367\/2009\/\nH.

These conduc-\ntance gradients are part of a larger structure and there are\nassociated features in the equivalent current data, so we may\nbe quite confident that they are real and not results of mis-\nmatched spatial resolution in the input data. Inside the auro-\nral tongue (Fig. 9) FAC is dominantly upward, as expected,\nalthough weak downward FAC are present at the western\nparts of the tongue. The different ionospheric sources of FAC\nare discussed in more detail in the next section.\n5.2.1 Components of FAC\nField-aligned currents are equal to the divergence of the hor-\nizontal sheet current, FAC=\u2207\u00b7J . Using ionospheric Ohm\u2019s\nlaw we can further decompose FAC into sum of three terms\nFAC = 6P\u2207 \u00b7E +\u22076P \u00b7E \u2212 (\u22076H \u00d7E)z. (1)\nHere we have assumed that the electric field is curl-free, as is\nthe case in the local KRM results.\nFigure 11 shows an example of the total FAC and of the\nthree different components at 02:18 UT. In this case there\nis a clear division so that the upward (negative) FAC stems\nfrom the divergence of the electric field, whereas the gra-\ndients of Hall and Pedersen conductance form the strip of\ndownward FAC. Comparison with the ASC image shown in\nFigs. 5 and 8 reveals that the North-South aligned strip of\ndownward FAC is located at the eastern (leading) edge of the\nauroral tongue. For other regions of the omega-band the FAC\ndivision is not shown, but inside the auroral tongue most of\nthe FAC is associated with\u2207\u00b7E, as the conductance gradients\nare rather weak there. At the trailing edge the conductance\ngradients are strong, but the upward FAC driven by \u22076H al-\nmost cancels the downward FAC associated with \u22076P , so\nthe narrow strip of upward FAC visible in Fig. 10 is driven\nmainly by \u2207\u00b7E.\nFigure 12 shows time series of the total upward and down-\nward FAC integrated over the emap data area, as well as\nthe division of FAC into different components. The area\nwhere the emap conductance estimate is available is about\n220\u00d7220 km, which is smaller than the spatial extent of the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3367\/2009\/ Ann.

Based on visual\ninspection of the time series of KRM results (as in Figs. 7-\n10, with 10 s resolution), we conclude that a major part of the\nvariations in Fig. 12 reflect spatial differences between vari-\nous parts of the omega-band, as they move over the area. This\nis shown in Fig. 12 by dividing the time series to five parts,\nlabelled A\u2013E. The transition from one region to another is\ngradual, so the times given in the figure are only indicative.\nHowever, there are also some real temporal variations in the\nFAC pattern, most importantly around 02:18 UT at the lead-\ning edge of the auroral tongue.\nAccording to Fig. 12 there is a net upward FAC in the\nemap data area during the whole omega-band event. The\ndownward FAC increases around 02:09\u201302:12 UT, when the\nprevious auroral tongue is giving way to the dark region of\nthe omega-band. However, at the same time also the upward\ncurrent increases, so that the net current does not change\nmarkedly. Around 02:16 the second bright auroral tongue\nbegins to cover the area, and the upward FAC decreases. At\nthe same time the downward current intensifies, so that in\nthe interval 02:18\u201302:21 UT the upward and downward cur-\nrents are nearly in balance. The decrease of upward FAC\nis mostly due to the movement of the omega-band, but the\nstrip of downward FAC at the leading edge of the tongue\n(see Fig. 8) intensifies markedly while moving eastward to-\ngether with the omega-band. The intensification is caused\nmainly by the changing direction of the equivalent current\nwith respect to the conductance gradient along the edge of\nthe auroral tongue. The abrupt decrease of downward FAC\nat 02:20 UT is caused by the leading edge of the tongue leav-\ning the analysis area. After this the downward current is very\nsmall and also the upward current stays almost constant as\nthe auroral tongue and the trailing edge move over the anal-\nysis area.\nThe middle and bottom panels of Fig. 12 show the rela-\ntive contributions of the three components in Eq. (1) to the\ndownward and upward FAC, respectively. The upward cur-\nrent shows a quite simple pattern, where the gradient of Hall\nconductance dominates in the beginning of the omega-band\nevent (i.e. at the trailing edge of the 1st tongue and in the dark\nregion between the tongues) while divergence of the electric\nfield is most important term during the latter half of the event\n(i.e. at the leading edge and within the tongue). The con-\ntribution from the gradient of Pedersen conductance remains\nbelow 25% for the whole period 02:06\u201302:30 UT. The tran-\nsition from \u22076H dominated upward FAC to \u2207\u00b7E dominated\noccurs around 02:16 UT, when the leading edge of the second\nauroral tongue begins to enter the analysis region.\nAnn.

Similar to Fig. 7, but for 02:28:00 UT.\nThe composition of downward FAC seems to be more\ncomplicated. During the interval 02:06\u201302:10 UT, i.e. when\nthe trailing edge of the first auroral tongue is leaving the anal-\nysis area, \u22076P is the most important contributor of down-\nward FAC. Around 02:10 UT the contribution from \u22076P\nstarts to decrease and \u2207\u00b7E becomes the dominant term for\nsome minutes, when the analysis area is covered by the dark\narea of the omega-band. As the leading edge of the second\nauroral tongue starts to move across the analysis area, the\ncontribution from \u22076H increases and reaches \u223c75% around\n02:20 UT, when the whole area is inside the tongue. At the\nsame time the role of \u2207\u00b7E as the source of downward FAC\ndecreases to almost zero. After about 02:20 UT there are\nlarge variations in the relative contribution from \u22076H and\n\u22076P , but the total amount of downward FAC is so small that\nthese variations probably are not meaningful.\n5.2.2 Joule heating\nIonospheric Joule heating PJoule=E\u00b7J is an important aspect\nof the energy flow in the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere\nsystem. Figure 13 shows a snapshot of the ionospheric\nelectric field, Pedersen conductance and Joule heating at\n02:18 UT, while Fig. 14 shows a time series of the Joule heat-\ning integrated over the emap data area as well as the corre-\nlation coefficients between Joule heating and Pedersen con-\nductance or electric field. The correlation coefficients are\ncalculated over the emap analysis area, separately for each\ntime step. Also here the time series reflects the properties of\nthe various parts of the omega-band, as they move over the\nanalysis area, rather than indicating temporal evolution of the\nomega-band as a whole.\nThe example shown in Fig. 13 demonstrates a strong cor-\nrelation between the Joule heating and electric field intensity,\nwhereas Joule heating and Pedersen conductance seem to an-\nticorrelate. The time series displayed in the upper panel of\nFig. 14 shows that the integrated Joule heating in the emap\nanalysis area has peak value of\u223c800 MW at 02:06 UT, when\nthe trailing edge of the first auroral tongue was about to leave\nthe area. During the passage of the second tongue the in-\ntegrated Joule heating decreased steadily, and reached mini-\nmum of\u223c100 MW around 02:20, when the analysis area was\ncovered by the bright auroral tongue. Afterwards Joule heat-\ning increased slowly, as the second tongue moved again out\nof the area.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 14 shows that the correlation\nbetween Joule heating and electric field or Pedersen con-\nductance changed markedly during the event.

This snapshot corresponds to the situation illustrated in Fig. 8.\nway to the dark area of the omega-band, the correlation\ncorr(PJoule, |E|) decreases to 0.15 while corr(PJoule, 6P ) in-\ncreases to 0.75. Around 02:14 there is a sharp transition,\nso that corr(PJoule, 6P ) changes sign from strong correlation\nto moderate anticorrelation and corr(PJoule, |E|) increases to\n0.95 in couple of minutes. This transition occurs when the\nanalysis area is still covered by the dark region, but the lead-\ning edge of the second auroral tongue is about to enter the\nanalysis area. During the rest of the event corr(PJoule, |E|)\nstays high, around 0.95. The correlation corr(PJoule, 6P ) re-\nmains around \u22120.5 during the time when the leading edge\nof the tongue moves over the anaysis area. Inside the au-\nroral tongue corr(PJoule, 6P ) is around zero, changing sign\nfrom about\u22120.4 to 0.4. The weak correlation between PJoule\nand 6P inside the auroral tongue is not surprising, as the\nconductance gradients in this region are rather weak, as is\nevident in Fig. 9. Behind the second auroral tongue Joule\nheating and Pedersen conductance again anticorrelate, so that\ncorr(PJoule, 6P ) reaches \u22120.5 around 02:28 UT, when the\ntrailing edge is in the middle of the analysis area.\n5.3 Comparison with CUTLASS measurements\nAs explained in Sect. 2.4, the Finnish CUTLASS radar mea-\nsured the line-of-sight plasma velocity during the omega-\nband event. We can calculate the same component of the\nE\u00d7B drift velocity from the local KRM results. The com-\nparison between CUTLASS measurements and local KRM\nresults is shown in Fig. 15 for 5 time steps in the interval\n02:06\u201302:22 UT. In this comparison we use the emap con-\nductance estimate as input in the local KRM method. The\nemap data area is covered by beams 4\u201310 of the CUTLASS\nradar, so that beam 4 intersects the area in the South-West\ncorner and beam 10 in the North-East corner. The local KRM\ndata shown in Fig. 15 is chosen from such time steps that cor-\nrespond to the integration time of CUTLASS beam 7 (in the\ncenter of the analysis area).\nThe time series at Fig. 15 begins at 02:06 UT, when the\neastern half of the area is filled with auroras related to the\nfirst auroral tongue (cf. Fig. 5. During the next time steps\nthe omega-band propagates eastward, so that at 02:10 UT the\nwestern half of the analysis area is covered by the dark region\nof the omega-band, at 02:14 UT the whole area is in the dark\nregion, at 02:18 UT the western half is covered by the second\nbright tongue and finally at 02:22 UT the tongue covers the\nwhole analysis area.\nWe see in Fig. 15 that there is a good qualitative agreement\nbetween the CUTLASS measurement and our local KRM re-\nsults. The plasma flow is first away from the radar, espe-\ncially at the eastern part of the analysis area, indicating an\neastward component of the electric field. The flow direc-\ntion changes towards the radar when the dark inter-tongue\nregion passes through the area around 02:14 UT, and finally\ninside the bright tongue the flow velocity is small, indicat-\ning also a suppressed electric field.

However, these differences do\nnot invalidate the general qualitative agreement.\n6 Discussion and conclusions\nWe have studied the electrodynamics of an omega-band event\nwith the local KRM method (Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm, 2007)\nthat uses magnetometer, riometer and optical data as input\nand generates the electric field as output. Magnetometer\ndata are used to estimate the ionospheric equivalent currents\nwhile optical and riometer data are used to estimate the iono-\nspheric conductances. The electric field obtained from the\nlocal KRM method together with the conductance estimates\ngives the spatial distribution of ionospheric currents (includ-\ning FAC) in the omega-band region. The omega-band se-\nquence (9 March 1999, 01:45\u201302:30 UT) studied in this pa-\nper consists of two discernible auroral tongues, the first of\nwhich was mixed with some pseudo-breakup type features.\nWe have used the second structure as a test case to evaluate\nthe consistency of our local KRM results with earlier omega-\nband studies.\nIn this study we have combined ground-based magnetome-\nter data with two separate conductance estimates that have\ncomplementary spatial resolution and extent. The satellite\ndata (UVI estimate, based on the UVI instrument onboard\nPOLAR) is used in a larger analysis area of 700\u00d7600 km\nand has spatial resolution of 360 km in longitude and 40 km\nin latitude. The ground-based conductance data (emap es-\ntimate, based on ASC and riometer data) is available at a\n220\u00d7220 km area with about 10 km resolution. These con-\nductance estimates have either been spatially interpolated\n(UVI) or averaged (emap) to the resolution of the equiva-\nlent current data (\u223c50 km). Even after averaging the higher\nspatial resolution of the emap conductance estimate over the\nequivalent current data may have caused some spurious small\nscale features to appear in the results. We have tried to iden-\ntify those in the text. On the other hand, the lower spatial\nresolution of the UVI estimate may have resulted in loss\nof detail in the large scale results. Conductance gradients\nin the UVI estimate are rather weak (\u22640.05 S\/km), which\nimplies a dominating role for equivalent currents in defin-\ning the distributions of electric field and FAC.

This\nsnapshot corresponds to the situation illustrated in Fig. 8\nUVI-based results of the omega-band current system are re-\nmarkably similar to the picture presented by Opgenoorth et\nal. (1983).\nIn our case the UVI-based conductance estimates are\nsystematically smaller than those from combined ASC\nand riometer data (emap estimates). Therefore the elec-\ntric field intensities in UVI-based results are roughly 1.5\ntimes larger than from ground-based data (\u223c50 mV\/m versus\n\u223c30 mV\/m). Previous studies do not help us in distinguish-\ning which of these values is more correct since the STARE\nradar has measured electric field values consistent with both\nestimates near omega-bands (Opgenoorth et al., 1983; Amm\net al., 2005). A test of the local KRM method with an ar-\ntificial omega-band model reveals that the method tends to\nyield too small electric field values (Vanhama\u00a8ki and Amm,\n2007). Consequently we suspect that the electric field inten-\nsities deduced both from UVI and emap conductances are\nunderestimates although the results from the latter method\nare surprisingly consistent with CUTLASS line-of-sight ve-\nlocity measurements in the dark region of the omega-band.\nIn this context it is important to remember that also different\nmeasurement techniques can yield different electric field es-\ntimates like in the case of Wild et al. (2000), where STARE\nmeasured significantly larger electric fields than CUTLASS\ndid in the same region.\nThe electric field and current patterns based on emap re-\nsults are more complicated than those from the UVI re-\nsults. The equivalent current varies rather smoothly in scales\n<200 km, while the emap conductances show large gradients\n(\u22640.7 S\/km) within the analysis area. Consequently, small\nscale structures appear also in our output data, especially in\nthe FAC patterns. In the dark regions where the electric field\nis large even small changes in the conductance may cause\nlarge FACs. Such FAC structures should be interpreted with a\ngrain of salt as they may be artefacts due to the different spa-\ntial resolution of the J eq,ion and conductance data sets used\nas input. The edges of the auroral tongues are safer areas\nto discuss and there our results show features quite similar\nto those found by Wild et al. (2000). A sheet of downward\n(upward) FAC resides at the eastern (western) edge of the\nauroral tongue while FACs inside the tongue are generally\nsmaller than at the edges. It is interesting to note that also\nthe omega-band event studied by Wild et al. (2000) was ac-\ncompanied with a simultaneous substorm intensification that\noccurred in the recovery phase of a previous substorm. Also\nthe omega-band event studied in this paper was associated\nwith pseudo-breakup type features.\nThe system of FAC sheets with alternating current direc-\ntions observed in our event has a much smaller effect on the\nbackground electrojet than found in the omega-band event\nof Amm et al. (2005), where the westward electrojet cur-\nrent is almost completely interrupted at the auroral tongue.\nIn our case the real horizontal currents follow quite closely\nthe behaviour of the equivalent currents, i.e. they show an\nundulating pattern, instead of a \u201cdashed line\u201d type electro-\njet like in the case of Amm et al. (2005). The current den-\nsity values in our FAC sheets are also much smaller than the\nvalues associated with the electrojet interruption. Also the\nspatial distribution of most intensive Joule heating regions\nis different in these two cases: while in the event of Amm\net al. (2005) strongest heating takes place in the tongues of\nhigh conductance, in our event heating is stronger within the\ndark region than inside the auroral tongue. We notice, how-\never, that the two tongues in our event have differences in\nthis respect: the heating rates associated with the first au-\nroral tongue are larger than those of the second tongue and\nof the dark region between the tongues. On the other hand,\nas the first tongue was combined with pseudo-breakup au-\nroras its higher Joule heating rates when compared to the\n\u201cpure\u201d omega-band tongue are not surprising. The lesson to\nlearn from our results is anyway that the spatial distribution\nof Joule heating in omega-bands cannot be deduced on the\nbasis of optical data alone.\nAnn.

Geophys., 27, 3367\u20133385, 2009\n3384 H. Vanhama\u00a8ki et al.: Electrodynamics of an omega-band\nThe exercise conducted in this paper has demonstrated that\nthe electrodynamics of omega-bands as deduced from opti-\ncal, riometer and magnetic data has the same main features\nas achieved with methods relying on radar observations. This\ngives some hope for more quantitative usage of all-sky cam-\nera data in the research of meso-scale electrodynamics asso-\nciated with magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling phenomena.\nIn addition to the spatial distribution of auroras also their in-\ntensities can be used when solving the ionospheric Ohm\u2019s\nlaw. Under certain conditions using auroral data instead of\nradar observations yields opportunities to see current and\nelectric field patterns with improved spatial resolution (i.e.\nscale sizes below 50 km). This opens new ways to investi-\ngate linkages between meso-scale and global phenomena in\nthose regions where dense magnetometer and all-sky camera\nnetworks reside in the field-of-view of SuperDARN radars.\nAcknowledgements.
