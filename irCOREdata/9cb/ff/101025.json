This can even prohibit lasing from\nthe ground state in some QD structures.3\u20135 Previous theoret-\nical studies6,7 suggested that the low gain arises because the\nbuilt-in piezoelectric field leads to the ground state hole\nwave function being elongated, with the matrix element then\nreduced due to lower overlap between the electron and hole\nwave functions. We show here that this is not the only reason\nfor low optical matrix element. The QDs in Refs. 6 and 7\nwere assumed to be pyramidal with a base to height aspect\nratio of 2. In real structures the typical QD shape is markedly\ndifferent, strongly influencing the electron and hole wave\nfunctions,8 and thereby modifying the optical matrix ele-\nment. Previous theoretical studies of InAs\/GaAs QDs either\ndo not contain calculations of the optical matrix element8,9 or\nconsider only one specific QD shape.10\nThe aim of this letter is to identify the factors determin-\ning the ground state optical matrix element in QDs, and its\ndependence on QD shape and size. In a bulk semiconductor\nthe optical matrix element decreases for transitions away\nfrom the Brillouin zone center, and also depends on the wave\nvector direction with respect to the light polarization. This\nfundamental property of semiconductors, as well as the pi-\nezoelectric effect, causes the matrix element in QDs to be\nvery sensitive to variations in the QD geometrical param-\neters, leading to a lower optical matrix element in QDs com-\npared to the maximum \u201cideal\u201d band edge value of a bulk\nsemiconductor.\nTo calculate the electronic structure of the QDs we use a\nplane-wave expansion method, assuming a periodic array of\n0003-6951\/2005\/87\u000121\u0002\/213106\/3\/$22.50 87, 21310\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Since the coefficients in Eq. \u00011\u0002 are\nnormalized, \u0005k,\u0001\u0006Ck,\u0001\n\u0001e,h\u0002\u00062=1, we immediately conclude from\nEq. \u00012\u0002 that the squared optical matrix element in a QD is\nalways smaller than that at k=0 in a bulk or quantum well\nmaterial.\nWe consider InAs QDs with a truncated pyramidal\nshape.8 The QD size and shape can be described by three\nindependent parameters; namely the QD height h, the aspect\nratio \u0001=bb \/h, and the truncation degree \u0005=bt \/bb \u0001the QD\nbottom and top are bb\u0003bb and bt\u0003bt squares, respectively\u0002;\nfor a full pyramid we have \u0005=0, while \u0005=1 for a QD box.\nFor the QDs under consideration the ground state matrix\nelement is much larger for light polarized in the QD x-y\nplane than it is for light polarized along the growth direction\nz. We therefore set the light polarization vector along the x\naxis. Keeping in mind the main application of the present\nstudy for gain calculations, we consider the quantity \u0006Mtot\u00062,\nwhich is the modulus squared of the optical matrix element\n\u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics6-1\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n213106-2 A.

Figure 1 shows the calculated varia-\ntion of \u0006Mtot\u00062 with dot height for five different shapes. \u0006Mtot\u00062\ninitially increases with dot height, in four of the five cases\nreaching a peak value beyond which it decreases rapidly. We\nalso note that in each case the value of \u0006Mtot\u00062 is noticeably\nsmaller than the maximum value of unity which might be\nexpected for an \u201cideal\u201d QD. The main aim of this letter is to\nidentify the causes of this behavior.\nIt can be seen from Eq. \u00012\u0002 that the magnitude of the\noptical matrix element is determined by two factors: \u0001i\u0002 the\ndependence of the bulk matrix element M\u0001\u0004 on k, and \u0001ii\u0002\nhow the coefficients Ck,\u0001\n\u0001e\u0002\nand Ck,\u0001\n\u0001h\u0002\noverlap in k space with\neach other and with M\u0001\u0004\u0001k\u0002. This overlap is very sensitive to\nthe QD size and shape. The hole wave function consists of\nmainly two components: a heavy-hole \u0001HH\u0002 contribution and\na light-hole \u0001LH\u0002 contribution \u0003each is represented by a sum-\nmation in Eq. \u00011\u0002 over the corresponding set of bulk states\u0004.\nFor the hole ground state, the admixture of LH bulk states is\ntypically about 10%\u201320%, depending on the QD geometry.\nWe therefore concentrate our analysis on the electron-HH\ncomponent. The dependence of the bulk matrix element\n\u0006M\u0001\u0004\u00062 on k for the electron-heavy-hole transition is illus-\ntrated in Figs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002 The optical matrix element is\ncalculated following the method developed in Ref. 14. For\nthe electron-heavy-hole bulk states, the maximum matrix el-\nement is achieved for a given \u0006k\u0006 when k is perpendicular to\nthe light polarization vector e=ex \u0003see Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004. In addition,\nthe bulk matrix element \u0006ME-HH\u00062 decreases quite rapidly as\n\u0006k\u0006 increases \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. For example when ky=0.46 nm\u22121\n\u0001which corresponds to a distance in real space of 2\u0006 \/k\n\b13.7 nm\u0002, the InAs bulk matrix element summed over spin\nstates is only 0.5 of its maximum value at k=0. This reduc-\ntion is due predominantly to band-mixing effects, and so is\nbest described in a k\u00b7p model that includes both the conduc-\ntion and valence bands, along with corrections due to other\nbands.14 The effect of decreasing matrix element with the\nin-plane momentum k\t is well-known in quantum well\nstructures.15 For example, the calculated optical matrix ele-\nment for E-HH transitions in an InGaAs quantum well de-\nFIG. 1.

The value of \u0006Mtot\u00062 is given in units of P0\n2 \u0003where P0 is the\ninterband momentum matrix element, P0= \u0001\u0007 \/m0\u0002\ns\u0006px\u0006x\u0007, see Ref. 11\u0004.

This effect is therefore considerably more pronounced\nhere than would be the case for bulk materials with larger\nband gap. The described properties of the E-HH bulk matrix\nelement have important consequences for the matrix element\nin QDs. As the QD height decreases, the characteristic size of\nthe electron and hole wave function in k space becomes\nlarger \u0003compare Figs. 2\u0001c\u0002 and 2\u0001d\u0002 with Figs. 2\u0001e\u0002 and 2\u0001f\u0002\u0004\nand the overlap in k space between Ck,\u0001\n\u0001e\u0002\n, Ck,\u0004\n\u0001h\u0002\n, and M\u0001\u0004\u0001k\u0002\nbecomes smaller: this can be clearly seen by comparing Fig.\n2\u0001b\u0002 with Figs. 2\u0001c\u0002\u20132\u0001f\u0002. The terms with larger \u0006k\u0006 \u0003and con-\nsequently a smaller average M\u0001\u0004 in Eq. \u00012\u0002\u0004 play a more\nimportant role in small QDs, leading to a reduction in the\nQD optical matrix element as the QD height decreases. Thus,\nthe trend of increasing \u0006Mtot\u00062 with h is a direct consequence\nof the k dependence of \u0006ME-HH\u00062 in a bulk semiconductor. We\ndiscuss later how this trend is interrupted for some QD\nshapes by piezoelectric effects, which lead to a sharp de-\ncrease in \u0006Mtot\u00062 beyond a critical value of h, see Fig. 1.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 that the unstrained bulk matrix\n2\nFIG. 2. \u0001a\u0002 Modulus squared of the optical matrix element for electron-\nheavy hole transitions \u0006ME-HH\u00062 in bulk unstrained InAs \u0001summed over de-\ngenerate spin states\u0002; units are the same as in Fig. 1, the light polarization\nvector is along the x direction. \u0001b\u0002 Contour plot of \u0006ME-HH\u00062 in the kx-ky plane\nfor bulk InAs; \u0001c\u0002\u2013\u0001f\u0002 Contour plot of the wave function coefficients \u0006Ck,\u0001\n\u0001e\u0002 \u00062\nand \u0006Ck,\u0001\n\u0001h\u0002 \u00062 in the kx-ky plane for QDs with \u0001=5, \u0005=0.75, and h=3 nm \u0001c\u0002,\n\u0001d\u0002 and h=9 nm \u0001e\u0002,\u0001f\u0002.

Interband optical transitions with\nex polarization require valence states with \u0006x\u0007 character. In\nthe unstrained bulk material, the HH state has no \u0006x\u0007 charac-\nter along the kx direction: therefore giving zero matrix ele-\nment, see Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. The anisotropy is reduced in quantum\nwell and in biaxially strained structures. The reduction in\nsymmetry splits the degeneracy of the HH and LH states at\nthe valence band maximum, thereby reducing the ability to\nmix \u0006z\u0007-like character from the LH states into the uppermost\nHH band. The relative contribution to the highest hole state\nof the \u0006z\u0007 Bloch components can then provide a quantitative\nmeasure of the anisotropy effect displayed in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002.17\nWhen the unstrained bulk HH band is averaged over all di-\nrections, the valence states have equal contributions of about\n33% from each of \u0006x\u0007, \u0006y\u0007, and \u0006z\u0007. The anisotropy observed\nin Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 is eliminated for a bulk material which is biaxi-\nally strained in the z direction, with the valence \u0006z\u0007 compo-\nnent then making nearly zero contribution to the uppermost\nvalence states. For the various QDs we considered the situ-\nation is between these two extreme cases and the \u0006z\u0007 terms\naccount for 7%\u201320% of the ground state hole wave function.\nThis is a significant contribution to the overall reduction in\nmatrix element, although not as large as might be expected\nbased on the bulk matrix elements presented in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002.\nThe piezoelectric field has previously been considered as\nthe main cause of a reduced matrix element in pyramidal\nQDs.6 Due to this field, the hole wave function becomes\nelongated and asymmetric in the x-y plane, leading to a de-\ncrease of the electron-hole overlap in real space. This situa-\ntion is illustrated in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. To demonstrate that the piezo-\nelectric field need not be the prime cause of a reduced matrix\nelement in medium-sized QDs \u0001with h\b5.5\u20136.5 nm\u0002, we set\nthe piezoelectric constants to zero in a test calculation on the\nQD of Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. The hole wave function is indeed more\nsymmetric without the piezoelectric field \u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004, which\nvisually increases the overlap between the electron and hole\nFIG. 3.

However, the calculated total matrix element\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to\u0006Mtot\u00062 increases only from 0.447 to 0.471 \u0001in units of P0\n2\n, see\ncaption to Fig. 1\u0002. The situation changes, however, when the\ndot size is increased. Depending on the dot shape, the hole\nwave function either remains nearly symmetric \u0003Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004 or\nbecomes strongly localized in two potential pockets \u0003Fig.\n3\u0001d\u0002\u0004. This localization leads to a steep drop in the matrix\nelement \u0006Mtot\u00062 beyond a critical dot size for some QD shapes\n\u0001see Fig. 1\u0002. The piezoelectric field creates two potential\npockets for holes, with the size and depth of these pockets\ndetermined by the QD geometry. In InAs QDs we find that\nthe piezoelectric potential pockets lose their ability to bind a\nhole for flat QDs \u0001\u0001=5, \u0005\b0.75\u0002, and the hole wave func-\ntion remains almost symmetric even for quite large QDs \u0001h\n=10 nm\u0002. The effect of the piezoelectric field on the optical\nmatrix element in large QDs then depends on the QD shape.\nFor many shapes this leads to a steep decrease of \u0006Mtot\u00062\nbeyond a critical QD height \u0001Fig. 1\u0002; however, for other\nshapes \u0001with a large aspect ratio \u0001 and truncation factor \u0005\u0002,\nthe piezoelectric field has little effect on the QD ground state\nmatrix element.\nIn summary, we have analyzed theoretically the ground\nstate optical matrix element in QDs. For many dots the k\ndependence of the bulk optical matrix element contributes to\na reduction in matrix element compared to that initially ex-\npected in an ideal QD. The magnitude of the matrix element\nis very sensitive to variations in QD size and shape. It should\ntherefore be possible to engineer the size and shape of QDs\nwith the aim to optimize the optical gain in QD lasers and\noptical amplifiers. In particular, \u201cflat\u201d QDs with a large as-\npect ratio have a larger matrix element. We conclude that,\ndepending on the QD geometry, the piezoelectric field may\neither have little effect on the ground state matrix element or\nelse will markedly reduce it, effectively switching off the\nground state optical transition in some QDs.\nThis work was supported by SFI \u0001Ireland\u0002.\n1D.
