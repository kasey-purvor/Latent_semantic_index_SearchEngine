Challenges to identity such\nas having to show others an unfit body, lacking\nconfidence and competence in core skills or\nappearing overly masculine were barriers to\nparticipation.\nIntroduction\nIt is generally accepted that physical activity\nconfers benefits to psychosocial health, functional\nability and general quality of life [1] and has been\nproven to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease\n[2] and some cancers [3]. Here, physical activity\nrefers to \u2018any bodily movement produced by skele-\ntal muscles that results in energy expenditure\u2019 [4].\nConditions associated with physical inactivity\ninclude obesity, hypertension, diabetes, back pain,\npoor joint mobility and psychosocial problems\n[5\u20137]. Physical inactivity is a major public health\nchallenge in the developed world and is recognized\nas a global epidemic [8]. Within the United States,\nthe rate of childhood obesity is expected to reach\n40% in the next two decades [9] and Type 2\ndiabetes is expected to affect 300 million people\nworldwide within the same time [10].\nThe UK government has set a target for \u201870%\nof the population to be reasonably active (for ex-\nample 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times\na week) by 2020\u2019 [8, 11] (p. 15). This target could\nbe described as ambitious; only 37% of men and\n24% of women in the United Kingdom currently\nmeet this benchmark [12]. The Health Survey for\nEngland (HSE) [13] found that the number of\nphysically inactive people (less than one occasion\nof 30-min activity per week) was increasing and\nthat this trend was consistent for both genders and\nPublic Health, University of Oxford, Rosemary Rue\nBuilding, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK\n*Correspondence to: S.

Conventionally, sport\nand forms of physical activity such as aerobics,\nrunning or gym work have been the focus of efforts\nto increase population activity levels. The HSE\nmeasure includes activities, such as gardening and\nhousework, which are not traditionally considered\nas physical activity. Sport England found that in\nthe 10-year period between 1987 and 1996 parti-\ncipation in traditional types of sport and phy-\nsical activity stagnated or fell in all groups other\nthan the 60- to 69-year old age group. This trend\nwas socially patterned by gender, socio-economic\nstatus, social class and ethnicity [15]. There are\nmany broad influences upon physical activity\nbehavior including intra-personal, social, environ-\nmental factors and these determinants vary across\nthe life course [4].\nAmbitious national targets and increased funding\nof community sport and physical activity projects\n(such as the Sports Hub in Regent\u2019s Park, London)\n[16] show that sport and physical activity is gaining\nsocial, political and health policy importance. The\nincreased interest in physical activity is welcome,\nbut the trend data hints that current interventions to\npromote sport and physical activity are inadequ-\nate. Further, it questions whether the evidence base\nsupporting physical activity policy provides an\nadequate understanding of the reasons for partici-\npation or non-participation in physical activity.\nHistorically, research into determinants of sport\nand physical activity participation has tended to\nadopt quantitative methods, which undertake cross-\nsectional surveys of pre-determined questions on\nindividual\u2019s knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about\nsport and physical activity. For example, the HSE\n[13] asks adults about activity in five domains:\nactivity at work, activity at home (e.g. housework,\ngardening, do it yourself maintenance (DIY)), walks\nof >15 min and sports and exercise activities.\nLarge studies such as these can successfully assess\nthe direction and strength of trends in participation\nbut are unable to explain how children and adults\nadopt, maintain or cease to participate in sport and\nphysical activity throughout their lives.\nAn alternative approach is required which is\nsensitive to the contextual, social, economic and\ncultural factors which influence participation in\nphysical activity [17]. Qualitative methods offer\nthis in-depth insight into individuals\u2019 experiences\nand perceptions of the motives and barriers to par-\nticipation in sport and physical activity [18] and\nare recognized as increasingly important in de-\nveloping the evidence base for public health [19].\nAlthough qualitative research is a blanket term for\na wide range of approaches, this type of research\ntypically aims to understand the meaning of in-\ndividual experience within social context. The data\nfor qualitative studies often come from repeated\ninterviews or focus groups, are generally more in-\ndepth and have fewer participants than quantitative\nresearch. Additionally, the inductive nature of\nqualitative research allows for theory to emerge\nfrom the lived experiences of research participants\nrather than the pre-determined hypotheses testing\nof quantitative approaches.\nThomas and Nelson [20] describe qualitative\nmethods as the \u2018new kid on the block\u2019 in sport and\nphysical activity research and a small body of\nqualitative research on sport and physical activity\nin the United Kingdom is known to exist. This\npaper aims to systematically examine published\nand unpublished qualitative research studies which\nhave examined UK children\u2019s and adults\u2019 reasons\nfor participation and non-participation in sport\nand physical activity.\nMethod\nThe review of qualitative research covered the\nperiod from 1990 to 2004. This 15-year period\nwas considered adequate to cover the most recent\nresearch on barriers and motivation to participa-\ntion in sport and physical activity. Research papers\nwere sourced in three ways. First, a wide range\nof electronic databases were searched, including\nMedline, CINAHL, Index to Thesis, ISI Science\nCitation Index, ISI Social Science Citation Index,\nPAIS International, PSYCHINFO, SIGLE and\nSPORTS-DISCUS. Second, relevant references\nfrom published literature were followed up and\nincluded where they met inclusion criteria.

This third step ensures inclusion of papers\nwhich may not be submitted to peer review journals\nincluding reports for government bodies such as\nSport England or the Department of Health. Search\nterms included \u2018sports\u2019, \u2018dancing\u2019, \u2018play\u2019, \u2018cycle\u2019,\n\u2018walk\u2019, \u2018physical activity\u2019, \u2018physical education\u2019 and\n\u2018exercise\u2019.\nPapers which met the following criteria were\nentered into the next phase of the review:\n(i) the aim of the study was to explore the\nparticipants\u2019 experiences of sport and physical\nactivity and reasons for participation or non-\nparticipation in sport and physical activity;\n(ii) the study collected information on participants\nwho lived in the United Kingdom; and,\n(iii) the study presented data collected using\nqualitative methods.\nTwo researchers (GC and SA) reviewed each\npaper independently. Results were compared and\ndiscrepancies discussed. Data were extracted using\na review schema developed by the research\nteam. In most cases, the original author\u2019s own\nwords were used in an attempt to convey the inten-\nded meaning and to allow for more realistic com-\nparison between studies.\nResults\nMore than 1200 papers were identified by the initial\nsearch strategy. A total of 24 papers were accepted\ninto the final stage of the review, with all but two\npublished during or after 1997. Half of the papers\n(12) reported research where data were collected in\ncommunity settings. Of the others, four were set in\ngeneral physician (GP) referral schemes (in which\nGPs refer patients to physical activity groups), three\nin schools, two in sports and leisure clubs and one\nin a group of three national sports governing bodies.\nTable I shows that studies described participants by\nsocio-economic status (working class, low income,\nprivate or public patient), ethnicity (South Asian\nand Black in one study, or Scottish, Pakistani,\nChinese, Bangladeshi in another) and level of exer-\ncise (Elite or other, participant or non-participant).\nTable I.

Of the nine that did, three\nused grounded theory, three used a feminist frame-\nwork, one used figurational sociology, one used\ngender relations theory and one used Sidentop\u2019s\nmodel of participation.\nThe age profile of participants was described\nin different ways although some grouping was\npossible (Table I). Two studies involved children\naged <15 years (5\u201315 years old and 9\u201315 years\nold), seven studies involved research with teenage\ngirls or younger women (aged between 14 and 24\nyears), 11 related to middle-aged participants (30\u2013\n65 years) and four reported on adults 50 years or\nolder. The results are organized in two sections:\nreasons for participation in physical activity and\nbarriers to participation in physical activity. Within\neach section, results are presented in order of the\nage group which participated in the study.\nReasons for participation in sport and\nphysical activity\nTable II summarizes the main findings of this\nreview. Although most people recognized that\nthere were health benefits associated with physical\nactivity, this was not the main reason for participa-\ntion. Other factors such as weight management,\nenjoyment, social interaction and support were\nmore common reasons for people being physically\nactive.\nYoung children\nParticipation for young children was found to be\nmore enjoyable when children were not being\nforced to compete and win, but encouraged to ex-\nperiment with different activities. MacPhail et al.\n[21] found providing children with many different\ntypes of physical activity and sport-encouraged\nparticipation. Enjoyment and support from parents\nwere also crucial [22]. Parents play a large role in\nenabling young children opportunities to be phys-\nically active and Bostock [23] found that mothers\nwith young children discouraged their children\nfrom playing in an environment perceived as\nunsafe. Porter [24] showed that parents are more\nsupportive of activity with easy access, a safe play\nenvironment, good \u2018drop-off\u2019 arrangements and ac-\ntivities available for other members of the family.\nTable II.

A number of studies [25\u201327] reported\npressure to conform to popular ideals of beauty as\nimportant reasons for teenage girls being physically\nactive. Flintoff and Scraton [28] interviewed very\nactive girls who described having learnt new skills,\nincreased self-esteem, improved fitness and de-\nveloped new social networks as motivation to be\nphysically active.\nSupport from family and significant others at\n\u2018key\u2019 transitional phases (such as changing schools)\nwas essential to maintaining participation [29].\nThose who continued participating through these\ntransitionary periods recalled the importance of\npositive influences at school in becoming and\nstaying physically active. For girls, having peers\nto share their active time with was important.\nAdults\nA wide range of adults were studied including\npatients in GP referral schemes, gay and disabled\ngroups, runners and South Asian and Black\ncommunities.\nAdults exercise for a sense of achievement, skill\ndevelopment and to spend \u2018luxury time\u2019 on them-\nselves away from daily responsibilities [30]. Non-\nexercisers recalled negative school experiences as\nreasons for not participating into middle age [31].\nStudies of GP exercise referral schemes found\nthat the medical sanctioning of programs was a great\nmotivator for participation [32]. Other benefits\nreported by referral scheme participants were the\nsocial support network created and the general\nhealth benefits of being active [30, 33].\nAmongdisabledmen, exerciseprovidedanoppor-\ntunity to positively reinterpret their role following\na disabling injury [34]. For this group, displaying\nand confirming their status as active and compet-\nitive was beneficial. Participants in this study\ndescribed the support network offered by partic-\nipation as the real value of physical activity and\nsport. In particular, meeting other disabled men\nand sharing similar experiences was a key moti-\nvator. The building of skills and confidence was\nanother motive for disabled men\u2019s participation in\nsport [35].\nThe enjoyment and social networks offered by\nsport and physical activity are clearly important\nmotivators for many different groups of people\naged between 18 and 50 years. The reasons for\nparticipation can, however, differ subtly between\npeople within a single group. For example, Smith\n[36] interviewed members of a running club and\nfound a distinction between \u2018runners\u2019 and \u2018joggers\u2019.\nRunners were elite members of the club and were\nmotivated by intense competition and winning.\nConversely, joggers did not consider themselves\ncompetitive in races but aimed to better their own\nprevious best time. Joggers were more motivated\nby the health benefits of running and the incre-\nased status afforded to them by non-exercisers who\nsaw them as fit and healthy.\nOlder adults\nHardcastle and Taylor [37] suggest that a complex\ninterplay of physical, psychological and envir-\nonmental factors influence participation among\nolder people. Older adults identified the health\nbenefits of physical activity in terms of reducing\nthe effects of aging and being fit and able to\nplay with grandchildren [38].\nWhile GP referrals [32, 39] encouraged the\nuptake of exercise in older age groups participation\nappears to be maintained through enjoyment and\nstrong social networks. This is exemplified by\nCooper and Thomas\u2019 [40] study of ballroom\ndancers in London. Social dancers described dance\nas helping them challenge the traditional expect-\nations of older people being physically infirm.\nParticipation over time was supported by the flexi-\nble nature of ballroom dancing. Different styles of\ndance provide more or less vigorous forms of\nactivity to suit the skills and limitations of each\ndancer. Equally important was the social network\nprovided by the weekly social dance encouraging\nthe maintenance of participation across major life\nevents such as bereavement through the support\nof other dancers in the group. Other studies also\nS. Allender et al.\n830\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/her.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nhighlight the importance of social networks in\nmaintaining participation [41].\nBarriers to participation in sport and\nphysical activity\nOn a simple level, barriers to participation in\nphysical activity include high costs, poor access\nto facilities and unsafe environments. Other more\ncomplex issues relating to identity and shifting\nsocial networks also have a great influence. There\nwere no studies reporting on the barriers to partici-\npation in sport and physical activity facing young\nchildren.\nTeenagers and young women\nNegative experiences during school physical\nactivity [physical education (PE)] classes were\nthe strongest factor discouraging participation in\nteenage girls [29]. For many girls, impressing\nboyfriends and other peers was seen as more im-\nportant than physical activity. While many girls\nwanted to be physically active, a tension existed\nbetween wishing to appear feminine and attractive\nand the sweaty muscular image attached to active\nwomen [25].\nA number of studies [27, 29, 42] showed that\ntight, ill-fitting PE uniforms were major impedi-\nments to girls participating in school sport. These\nconcerns over image and relationships with peers\nled to an increased interest in non-active leisure.\nFlintoff and Scraton [28] cited the disruptive\ninfluence of boys in PE class as another major\nreason for girls\u2019 non-participation. The competitive\nnature of PE classes and the lack of support for\ngirls from teachers reinforced these problems. Girls\nwere actively marginalized in PE class by boys and\nmany described not being able to get involved in\ngames or even getting to use equipment. Teachers\nwere found to be complicit in this marginal-\nization by not challenging the disruptive be-\nhavior of boys in class. Coakley and White\n[29] noted that boys were also disruptive out of\nclass and some boys actively discouraged their\ngirlfriends from participating in sport as it\nmade them look \u2018butch\u2019. Mulvihill et al. [22] and\nCoakley and White [29] both argue that gender\nstereotyping has serious negative effects on the\nparticipation of girls. Realistic role models for all\nbody types and competency levels were needed\nrather than the current \u2018sporty\u2019 types.\nOrme [42] found that girls were bored by the\ntraditional sports offered in PE. Mulvihill et al.\n[22] found that many girls were disappointed\nwith the lack of variety in PE and would rather\nplay sports other than football, rugby and hockey.\nBeing unable to demonstrate competency of a skill\nto peers in class also made people uncomfortable\nwith PE. Non-traditional activities such as dance\nwere more popular than traditional PE as they\nprovided the opportunity for fun and enjoyment\nwithout competition [28].\nCoakley and White [29] showed that the transi-\ntion from childhood to adulthood was a key risk\ntime for drop-out. Teenagers did not wish to be\nassociated with activities which they described as\n\u2018childish\u2019 and instead chose activities that were\nindependent and conferred a more adult identity\nupon them. One participant in this study described\nleaving a netball team of younger girls because it\nwas \u2018babyish\u2019. A number of young women inter-\nviewed by these researchers described their belief\nthat \u2018adult\u2019 women did not participate in physical\nactivity or sport.\nAdults\nAnxiety and lack of confidence about entering\nunfamiliar settings such as gyms were the main\nbarriers to participation in GP referral schemes. Not\nknowing other people, poor body image and not\nfitting in with the \u2018gym\u2019 culture were the prime\nconcerns of this group [33]. The adults reported in\nthe studies reviewed did not identify with role\nmodels used to promote physical activity and\npeople from this age group suggested that realistic\nexercise leaders would be more effective in en-\ncouraging participation [41]. The lack of realistic\nrole models was also a problem for members of the\nSouth Asian and Black community [43]. This group\ndid not see physical activity as a black or Asian\npursuit, but rather as white, middle-class, male\ndomain. The authors argue that there were few\nopportunities or facilities available to this group.\nUnderstanding participation in sport and physical activity\n831\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/her.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nSelf-perception is incredibly important in moti-\nvating people to participate in all types of physical\nactivity. The stigma attached to being socially dis-\nadvantaged was shown to decrease exercise among\nlow-income women in the Midlands [23]. Women\nin this study did not want others to see them\nwalking due to the social stigma attached with\nnot owning a car.\nArthur and Finch\u2019s [35] study of adults with\ndisabilities found that few relevant or positive role\nmodels existed. Disabled men reported a lack of\nknowledge about the appropriate types or levels of\nactivity in relation to their disability. Additionally\nthere were few opportunities to meet other people\nwho were active and disabled. This study also\nfound that the dominance of masculine stereotypes\nin sport was a particular challenge to participation\namong gay men. These men expressed concerns\nabout not fitting in and not being one of the \u2018lads\u2019.\nGay men reported withdrawing from organized\nsport due to feeling uncomfortable in the associated\nsocial situations [34].\nShaw and Hoeber\u2019s [44] discourse study of three\nEnglish sports governing bodies reinforced the\nnegative impact of macho culture in sport. Their\nstudy found that discourses of masculinity were\npredominant at all levels of the organization from\ncoaching to senior management. The use of gen-\ndered language was shown to actively discourage\nwomen from advancing in these organizations.\nDiscourses of femininity (characterized by loyalty,\norganizational, communicative and human re-\nsource skills) were associated with middle and\nlower management positions compared with\nmasculine discourses (centered on elite coaching,\ncompetition and the imperative to win), which were\nassociated with senior organizational roles.\nOlder adults\nSome older adults were unsure about the \u2018right\namount\u2019 of physical activity for someone of their\nage [38]. As in other age groups, the lack of realistic\nrole models in the community was a deterrent.\nExercise prescriptions were perceived as targeted\nat young people and not relevant to older groups.\nPorter [31] found that older people were anxious\nabout returning to physical activity and identified\ncost and time barriers as the main problems.\nDiscussion\nThis paper has reviewed the qualitative research into\nthe reasons for participation and non-participation\nof UK adults and children in sport and physical\nactivity. The review covered all qualitative papers\nrelating to sport and physical activity in the United\nKingdom from 1990 to 2004.\nAlthough we did find >20 studies, few studies\nmet the basic qualitative research quality criteria of\nreporting a theoretical framework [45]. It would\nappear that little theory is being generated empir-\nically and suggests that any understanding of\nreasons for participation and non-participation in\nphysical activity in the United Kingdom may be\nlimited.\nShaw and Hoeber [44] provide one example of\nthe benefits a theoretical framework brings to\nqualitative research in their analysis of the gendered\nnature of discourses in three national sporting\nbodies. Their feminist discourse analysis frame-\nwork directed the research toward the particular\nforms of language used in a specific social setting\nand the implications of this language for marginal-\nizing some groups while supporting the domin-\nance of others. The authors used this framework to\nshow how the masculine discourses used in senior\npositions actively reduced the career opportunities\nfor women, while men were shown to be actively\ndeterred from regional development officer posts\nby the feminine discourse surrounding these roles.\nMotivations and barriers to participation\nFun, enjoyment and social support for aspects of\nidentity were reported more often as predictors of\nparticipation and non-participation than perceived\nhealth benefits. For young children and teenage\ngirls in particular, pressure to conform to social\nstereotypes is a key motivator. Along with older\ngroups, children see enjoyment and social interaction\nwith peers as reasons to be physically active.\nAlthough girls report a willingness to be active,\nS. Allender et al.\n832\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/her.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nthis must be on their own terms in a safe non-\nthreatening environment.\nA clear opposition can be seen between girls\nwanting to be physically active and at the same time\nfeminine [25] and the strongmacho culture of school\nand extracurricular sport [46]. One area where the\nevidence base is strong is the negative impact which\nschool PE classes have on participation of young\ngirls. Changing PE uniforms, providing single\nsex classes and offering alternate, non-competitive\nforms of PE are easy, realistic ways in which PE\ncould be changed and which the research suggests\nwould improve long-term participation. Addition-\nally, teachers need to take a more active role in en-\nsuring that students are involved and enjoying PE\nclasses. There appears to be some change in this\narea. The Youth Sports Trust\/Nike Girls Project\n\u2018Girls in Sport\u2019 program involved 64 schools across\nEngland with the intention of creating \u2018girl-friendly\u2019\nforms of PE and with changing school practices\nand community attitudes [47]. Preliminary results\nshow changes in the style of teaching in PE, \u2018girl-\nfriendly\u2019 changing rooms, positive role models for\ngirls in sport, extended and new types of activities,\nrelaxed emphasis on PE kit and an emphasis on\nrewarding effort as well as achievement.\nA number of papers reviewed made the point that\nthe role models for children and young adults are\nusually beautiful and thin in the case of women and\nmuscular in the case of men. The desire to be thin\nand, in the case of girls, feminine, leads to increased\nmotivation to be physically active [28]. This desire\nis not as strong in older populations and from the\nmid-20s on, role models with a perfect body have\na negative effect on participation [43].\nWhile the masculine nature of organized and\nsemi-organized sport culture marginalizes women,\nthis review has shown that groups of men are also\nmarginalized. Robertson [34] has suggested a re-\nthinking of youth sports and in particular the links\nbetween sport and masculine identities. Identity\nformation is a key transition in adolescence, and\nthere is some evidence that physical activity\nadvances identity development. Kendzierski [48]\nreported that individuals with an exercise self-\nschema (self-perception as a physically active per-\nson) tended to be active more often and in more\ntypes of activity than those with a non-exercise\nschema (self-perception as not physically active).\nThis relationship between leisure activity and id-\nentity may also be dependent on gender and the\ngendered nature of activities [49]. Alternate models\nof sporting clubs, such as those in which children\ncan try a number of traditional and non-traditional\nsports in one place, could also provide improved\ntake up and maintenance of participation.\nImplications for the promotion of sport\nand physical activity\nWith the exception of the walking and cycling\naction plan, there appears to be little reference to\nempirical research on reasons for and barriers to\nparticipation in physical activity in government\npolicy [11, 50\u201355]. The Department for Culture,\nMedia and Sports (DCMS) acknowledge this gap\nin knowledge in their \u2018Game Plan\u2019 document:\n... throughout the sport and physical activity\nsector the quality and availability of data on\nfacilities, participation, long term trends, behav-\nioural and other factors is very poor [11] (p. 14).\nOur review has found some evidence of relevance\nto policy makers about why children and adults do\nor do not participate in sport and physical activity.\nDespite this there appears to be little reference to\nlarge population surveys and no reference to quali-\ntative research in policy documents. Similar find-\nings to those presented in this review have been\nobserved in studies conducted in other countries. A\nqualitative study of participation in physical activ-\nity in Australia found similar motivating factors\nsuch as fun, enjoyment and socializing with friends\nand similar barriers including time constraints and\nnegative pressure from peers [56]. Unless more\nrecognition is paid to these factors it is no surprise\nthat the effectiveness of current individual ap-\nproaches to promote physical activity will remain\nshort term and modest [57, 58]. Ongoing research\nfor physical activity in the United Kingdom needs\nto develop theoretical frameworks to underpin\nhealth promotion interventions, programs and\ncampaigns that draw on the existing evidence.\nUnderstanding participation in sport and physical activity\n833\n at O\nxford Journals on February 3, 2012\nhttp:\/\/her.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nLittle is known about the reasons why people\ndo and do not participate in physical activity and\nthe relationship between their levels of participa-\ntion and different stages in their lives. A number\nof the papers reviewed [29, 34, 35] found that sig-\nnificant shifts in the life course have implications\nfor participation in physical activity. A mix of\nquantitative and qualitative methods could build\nan evidence base to understand changes to sport\nand physical activity at critical transitional phases\nduring childhood, adolescence and adult life. This\nreview provides a starting point for new work.\nConclusion\nThis review has identified qualitative studies of\nthe reasons for and barriers to participation in sport\nand physical activity. Participation is motivated by\nenjoyment and the development and maintenance\nof social support networks. Barriers to participation\ninclude transitions at key stages of the life course\nand having to reorient individual identities during\nthese times. The theoretical and evidence base\ninforming policy and health promotion is limited\nand more work needs to be done in this area.\nCon\ufb02ict of interest statement\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1.
