Introduction \nThe measurement of gases at or near surface is likely to be a required part of monitoring at geological CO2 \nstorage sites. It is the ultimate test of leakage to the atmosphere from a site, helps reassure the public and regulators, \nand may be needed for accounting purposes. Although significant leakage from underground stores of CO2 is not \nexpected, it is important to study the effects of leaking gases on ecosystems in order to understand their potential \nimpact and to determine appropriate remediation strategies. Gas measurements at natural CO2 vents have been used \nto help understand the spatial and temporal distribution of gases and assess their impact on ecosystems. \n \nCommercial storage sites are likely to be of such a scale that the surface monitoring will be over at least tens of \nsquare kilometres. Also, by analogy with natural CO2 vents, the surface footprint of a gas leak may be less than 10 \nm across. In order to discover such small features in these large areas, rapid monitoring methods will be needed; \nconventional soil gas techniques that involve single point measurements are likely to be far too time consuming and \ncould miss leaks. \n \nCurrently available techniques for the near-surface measurement of gas concentrations include both field and \nlaboratory methods. Field measurements are usually quite rapid (a few minutes per observation) and can provide \ninstant results but tend to be of lower precision. Laboratory techniques, which can be carried out in a field laboratory \nor mobile facility, or in a fully fledged laboratory, are typically of higher precision but are more laborious and there \nis some delay in obtaining results. Both approaches usually only provide data for a single point This means that \nsurveying a larger area is only possible, within a reasonable time frame, using widely spaced sampling intervals. \n. \nStudies of sites of natural CO2 leakage have been undertaken over a number of years [1-6]. They indicate that gas \nvents can be restricted in size, and may have a surface expression of less than 10 m across. Features of this size \nwould be easily missed by point measurements; unless they were closely spaced. However, very close spacing \n \n* Corresponding author.

Areas of more diffuse venting can be 50-100 m across and provide a \nsomewhat larger target, albeit of lower intensity. \n \nIn order to cover large areas in a reasonable timeframe rapid methods are required. These ideally need to provide \ngood sensitivity and a dense coverage of closely spaced observations. Several new methods for rapid surveying of \nsurface gas concentrations have been tested in this study; open path laser, ground surface measurement techniques \nand hyperspectral remote sensing. These have been evaluated alongside existing techniques at two sites of natural \nCO2 seepage in Italy and Germany. The airborne hyperspectral work is described by Pearce at al [] and will not be \ndiscussed further here. The work formed part of wider ranging studies for the CO2Geonet Network of Excellence \n[7]and the CO2ReMoVe project, both funded through the European Commission \n2. Methods \nCommercial open path laser systems are available for CO2, CH4 and a range of other industrial gases [e.g. 8]. At \nthe start of this study (2006) CH4 systems were available as tripod-mounted (measuring the gas concentration in air \nbetween the instrument and a reflector on another tripod) and airborne or vehicle-mounted options (where the \nmeasurement is made over a fixed path length with the laser and reflectors deployed in a probe mounted on the \nvehicle). The CO2 system was only available as a tripod mounted configuration. Whilst the mobile CH4 system had \na reported sensitivity of 0.5-1 ppm, the sensitivity for the tripod-mounted CO2 equipment was quoted at 100 ppm. \n \nA tripod-mounted GasFinder2.0 CO2 unit (Boreal Laser Inc.) was tested over natural seeps of CO2 at sites near \nLatera, Italy. The results of these tests led to the commissioning of a new mobile open path CO2 laser system based \non a shorter wavelength tunable laser diode, with a reported sensitivity of 5-10 ppm and a completely redesigned \nprobe. This equipment was also tested at Latera, and near the Laacher See in Germany in September 2007. Based on \nearly experience of the system, modifications were made before further tests in Germany in July 2008. \n \nAnother potential method of rapid surveying was also trialed at Latera. This involved measurements of near-\nground gas concentrations at a slow walking pace with a portable pumped infrared analyzer. The results of these \ntrials were tested against more established soil gas methods, including measurements of CO2 flux and concentrations \nof a range of soil gases. \n \nFlux of CO2 was measured by the accumulation chamber technique using a West Systems flux meter with a \nLICOR LI820 CO2 analyzer and systems built by SUR, and BGR. Samples of soil gases, for field or laboratory \nmeasurement, were obtained using small diameter hollow steel probes or by drilling. Samples were collected at \nvariable depths of up to 1 m, depending on specific requirements and local conditions, such as the depth of the water \ntable. Field analysis of CO2, CH4 and other gases (O2, H2S, CO) was made using a variety of instruments with IR \nand electrochemical sensors including, Geotechnical Instruments GA2000, Draeger X-am 7000 and Multiwarn II \nand ADC LFG20. Radon was measured with a Pylon AB5 or an Algade system, both using ZnS scintillation cells, \nand He with an Alcatel 100HDS He mass spectrometer. Gas samples were also measured in the laboratory by gas \nchromatography\/mass spectrometry. To assist with the interpretation of data, weather observations were obtained \nusing a Campbell Scientific automatic weather station, providing data on air temperature, barometric pressure, wind \nspeed and direction, solar radiation and soil moisture content. Additional observations in Germany were obtained \nfrom local official and private weather stations. A Campbell Scientific eddy covariance system was deployed at the \nLaacher See in 2007 to measure CO2 flux near to the gas vents. \n3. Background on field sites \nThe Latera caldera is in central Italy, about 110 km NW of Rome. It formed by the collapse of a Quaternary \neruptive centre, dating back to about 0.8 Ma [9]. Carbon dioxide and other trace gases, probably produced by \nthermo-metamorphic reactions in carbonates at depth are being emitted at surface [4, 9]. The gas migration is \ncontrolled by faulting and gives rise to gas vents in areas of high flux or zones of more diffuse release to atmosphere \n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000  \nwhere flow rates are lower [9]. A number of vents occur in the caldera floor, where the gas is passing through tens \nof metres of alluvium before being finally emitted into the atmosphere. \n \nThe Laacher See is a flooded caldera in the East Eifel volcanic region of SW Germany. The lake was created \nfollowing the only known large explosive eruption in Central Europe during late Quaternary time (at about 12,900 \nyr BP) [10]. CO2 degassing from an underlying magma chamber has been known for many years, and helium and \ncarbon isotope data indicate a deep, mantle origin for the gases [11, 12]. Surface gas emissions are known, or \nsuspected, from several locations in and around the lake shore[11, 13]. They occur, at least in part, in areas of the \nlake that were drained as recently as 1844, following an early reduction in the water level in 1164. \n4. Results \nInitial tests of the tripod mounted open path laser system took place in summer 2005 over gas vents at Latera. A \nnumber of experiments were carried out. One involved measuring different paths across a gas vent. Each path was \nmeasured in turn for about 10 minutes and the process was repeated at 2 different heights, 61 cm and 143 cm, to \nassess vertical mixing and dilution effects. The concentrations measured were all above normal atmospheric levels \n(> 380 ppm) and showed the effect of the prevailing E to NE wind (Fig. 1). At higher CO2 levels there was greater \nvariation in the values, reflected by increased standard deviations, caused by wind-induced variable mixing of the \nescaping CO2. Another trial entailed setting the laser on one side of a small creek containing a strong CO2 vent and \nthe reflector on the other side of the creek at progressively increasing distance from the laser (16-100 m). The \nanomalous signal related to the vent steadily declined with increasing distance between laser and reflector until at \n100 m there was no difference between the observed concentration and that of background measurements well away \nfrom any vents. Since the laser measures the average gas content over the whole path length the short distance with \nelevated CO2 eventually becomes diluted to such an extent that the value is not distinguishable from background. \n \nThese results suggested that the original instrument would only be suitable for monitoring small sites, such as \naround a well head, and not for surveying large areas rapidly, due to the dilution of even strong CO2 emissions (up \nto 2 kg m-2 d-1). This indicated the need for a different approach for large areas using mobile equipment of higher \nsensitivity. \n \nThe first trials of the new mobile open path CO2 laser system were carried out at Latera and near the Laacher See \nin September 2007. The equipment in each case was mounted on a quad bike with gas data being recorded every \nsecond, in conjunction with positions from a GPS receiver, as traverses were made in areas of known or suspected \ngas vents. In the first deployment at Latera a survey of a field with known CO2 vents, including that used for the \ninitial static laser tests, was repeated on two separate days, 5 and 6 September 2007 (Fig. 2). The two surveys \nshowed similar patterns, detecting the two main known vents in the field and suggesting other areas of weaker gas \nemissions. The results were, however, different in some details. The anomaly related to the main vent was displaced \nfrom the vent itself on the repeat survey. Meteorological data, recorded on site, showed that this displacement was \nconsistent with the wind direction at the time; from the SW at up to 4-5 ms-1 on 6 September compared to up to 5-6 \nms-1 from a northerly direction on the previous day. The gas concentration at a point at any one instant is likely to \n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000 \nFig. 1.

To the north of the vent there is some shelter from tall trees, but the site is more \nopen to the south. There is also a possibility that some of the displacement could be due to positional error, as a \nsimple, low accuracy GPS receiver was used for the trial. The CO2 levels were also different from one day to the \nnext, but data are too sparse to infer whether this reflects short term variability or longer timescale (diurnal) changes. \nIn addition to the altered wind direction there was a slight increase in soil moisture content (from 19 to 21%) \nfollowing rain overnight and during the second day. The relative humidity of the air was thus higher on 6 September \n(32-42% compared with around 30%) although atmospheric pressure and temperature were little different. \n \n Almost 1.5 hours of static observations were made with the mobile system (Fig. 3), within an area of gas escape, \nbut not directly over a vent, during an airborne test of direct detection of CO2 using hyperspectral remote sensing \ntechniques. These showed marked short term changes in CO2 concentration similar to those observed on the \nrepeated traverses. The levels were generally well above the average atmospheric CO2 concentration probably \nreflecting higher overall values due to the venting of CO2 in the area. These results suggest, as with the static laser \nexperiments, that the variability of the readings may also be useful as an indicator of gas escape and could be \nparticularly helpful where more diffuse leakage is occurring, and pronounced anomalies might not be observed. \n \nA series of traverses, repeated in different directions, were also completed across the main gas vent (Fig. 4). \nThese showed the influence of short-term changes in the CO2 concentration at a given height. These can alter the \nmeasured contents over short periods (seconds to minutes). Nonetheless, the influence of the vent was seen on each \nprofile, albeit above a variable \u2018background\u2019 level. \nFig. 3. Gas concentrations in air measured with the mobile laser at one location during a remote sensing overflight at Latera, 5 September 2007  \nA similar quad bike was used to test the mobile laser equipment around the Laacher See in Germany although, \nbecause of slight differences between the bikes, it was possible to mount the laser probe closer to the ground (30 \ncm) than had been possible in Italy (60 cm). A number of fields on the western shore of the lake were surveyed with \nthe laser system. There was much less known about the gas concentrations and fluxes at this site, but the presence of \ngas vents was inferred from a small number of earlier measurements and from observed changes in the vegetation. \n \nFive fields along the lake shore (c 100,000 m2) were surveyed over the course of 3 days (20-22 September, \n2007), with one field, with 2 conspicuous gas vents, repeated on consecutive days to assess the reproducibility of the  \n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n12\n35\n09\n12\n37\n05\n12\n39\n01\n12\n40\n57\n12\n43\n50\n12\n45\n46\n12\n47\n42\n12\n49\n38\n12\n51\n34\n12\n53\n30\n12\n55\n26\n12\n57\n22\n12\n59\n18\n13\n11\n28\n13\n13\n24\n13\n15\n20\n13\n17\n16\n13\n19\n12\n13\n21\n08\n13\n23\n04\n13\n25\n00\n13\n26\n56\n13\n28\n52\n13\n30\n48\n13\n33\n07\n13\n35\n03\n13\n36\n59\n13\n38\n55\n13\n40\n51\n13\n42\n47\n13\n44\n43\n13\n46\n39\n13\n48\n35\n13\n50\n31\n13\n52\n27\n13\n54\n23\n13\n56\n19\n13\n58\n42\nTime (hhmmss)\nC\nO\n2 p\npm\nMean CO2\nMean atmospheric CO2\n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000 \nFig. 4.

There was good agreement between the repeat surveys both in terms of the concentrations of CO2 and the \npatterns observed. However, the CO2levels from the first 2 fields surveyed (the southernmost) were significantly \ndifferent although there were no appreciable changes in weather or soil conditions over this period. \n \nThe 2 principal gas anomalies seen (Fig. 5) were investigated with conventional soil gas concentration and flux \nmeasuring techniques. The vent centres were associated with concentrations of CO2 approaching 100 % at 60-80 cm \ndepth and flux rates ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 kg m-2 day-1. As at Latera these values drop to background within a \nshort distance (usually 10 m or less) from the vent centre. More diffuse anomalies were found to have \nconcentrations and fluxes that were lower but clearly above background, although this could not be established in all \ncases. This may suggest false positives or the difficulty in relocating the positions accurately with a handheld GPS. \n \nThe same fields were re-surveyed in July 2008 and the survey area was extended to include an area south of the \nlake. Preliminary data suggest very similar patterns to those obtained in 2007, with atmospheric gas anomalies over \nthe 2 known vents and further weaker features in the northernmost field closest to the lake. The latter were not \nassociated with bare soil or obvious vegetation changes and were harder to directly link to higher soil gas \nconcentrations and fluxes. However, fluxes ranged from 23-54 g m2 day-1 and concentrations up to 9.1 % CO2. By \ncomparison with values for sites with similar vegetation, but no CO2 escape (typically < 30 g m2 d-1 and < 4 %), the \nresults are suggestive of diffuse gas escape. \n \nInitial testing of the ground-surface measurement system involved an assessment of the effect of sampling height \non sensitivity.  To this end, a series of traverses were conducted across two gas vents at the Latera test site at 0, 10, \n20, and 50 cm above ground surface (Fig. 6); the surveys were performed at a slow walking pace, resulting in a \nsample spacing of about 75 cm. There was no indication of the weaker gas vent at heights greater than 10 cm, and \nthe response to the stronger vent declined markedly with height, so subsequent tests were all done at ground level. It \nwas found that the stability of the infrared detector was critical to differentiating areas with weak CO2 leakage from \nbackground. The time for the detector to return to background values and dilution were found to be significant, and \nthus new sensor types and general system design are being examined to try to minimize these effects.  Finally, to \nevaluate the potential of the method for rapid reconnaissance mapping, a series of parallel lines 10m apart (with 50 \ncm sample spacing) were measured over an area of about 80,000 m2; this mapping exercise took about 5 hours.  \nResults highlighted all known vents and located 2 vents that were previously unknown.  Work is ongoing to improve \nsurvey speed, test the instrument under different meteorological and plant growth conditions, and to better \nunderstand the detection limit of the method. \n5. Conclusions \nMobile open path laser techniques have been tested in areas of known CO2 release. They successfully identified \nzones of significant gas venting and located areas of weaker gas flux at lower concentrations. Early results suggest \nthat, in addition to obvious anomalous values, a statistical analysis of datasets could also be important. There \nappears to be a greater degree of variability in near surface atmospheric CO2 concentrations in areas of gas venting. \nThis is reflected in a higher standard deviation for these datasets compared with those from background areas. More \ncomparative data are needed from true background sites where no gas escape is occurring. Limited data from sites in \nthe UK show much reduced ranges of CO2 values compared with the volcanic terrains described here. It would be \nimportant to define the baseline gas concentrations at a storage site, prior to any CO2 injection, and to assess their \nvariability i.e. in different seasons and weather conditions. \n \nSimple, inexpensive surveying of near-ground atmospheric gas concentrations, with portable infrared analyzers, \nhas also been tested successfully and improvements to the design of the equipment are underway. Dispersion and \ndilution of CO2 emissions with height above the ground means that measurements should be made close to the \nground surface. The variability of concentrations with time suggests that rapid survey methods are perhaps best \nsuited to location of features requiring follow-up investigation with other techniques. \n \n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2010) 000\u2013000 \nA high level of positional accuracy is desirable when mapping gas concentrations as this makes verification of \napparent anomalies much easier. It is evident from natural CO2 vents that the target can be very small, perhaps only \na few meters across. The inherent accuracy of handheld GPS receivers is such that matching point observations to \nthe rapid survey results can be difficult; sub-meter positional accuracy is desirable and was used for our latest work \n \nSuch rapid methods have great promise for monitoring for CO2 leakage at sites of geological CO2 storage. It is \nnot envisaged that these techniques would remove the need for more conventional point measurements and sampling \nfor laboratory analysis as any anomalies identified with these methods would have to be verified and the source of \nthe anomaly defined. It is also possible that leakage may not be continuous, but vary over time due to subsurface and \nnear surface conditions (e.g. pressure variations). Discontinuous pulses of gas escape could be missed by rapid large \narea methods that provide only a snapshot series of observations. Thus there is likely to a need for continuous \nmonitoring at a number of locations, using methods such as eddy covariance or soil gas monitoring stations. These \nlocations would be chosen on the basis of the results from wide area surveys and using site-specific knowledge of \npotential pathways for gas migration from depth, such as indications of faults or fractures or well sites. \nReferences \n1.
