In the Atlantic Ocean the THC is associated with\nmeridional overturning in which a northward flow of light\nsurface waters is balanced by a southward flow of dense\ndeep waters. Since the surface waters are warm while\nthe deep waters are cool, this overturning transports heat\nnorthwards, and helps to maintain the climate at high lat-\nitudes.\nAlthough the THC is often characterised in terms of\na two-dimensional (zonal mean) meridional overturning\nstream function, in reality it has a complicated three-\ndimensional structure. The important density gradients\narise not simply in the meridional direction but also in\nthe zonal direction, as required to maintain approximate\ngeostrophic balance of the meridional flows. Furthermore,\nlocalised features such as overflows, and the southward\nflowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), are\nknown to play important roles.\nThe complex spatial (and temporal) structure of the\nTHC is one of the barriers to progress in understand-\ning ocean circulation. In the face of this complexity, it\nis reasonable to ask whether there may be efficient ways\nof representing the THC that retain some of the simplic-\nity of a meridional stream function (in particular, many\nfewer degrees of freedom than the full system) but provide\na more accurate representation of the three-dimensional\ndynamics. Besides their value for conceptual understand-\ning, efficient representations have found many applications\nin climate science, e.g. for identifying dominant modes of\nvariability, for comparing models with one another and\nwith observations, and for studies of predictability (e.g.\nKleeman et al. 2003).\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA), also known as\nEmpirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, is one of\nthe most common tools for the efficient representation of\nlarge data sets (Preisendorfer 1988). In climate science\nPCA is typically used to provide a representation of a\nspace-time data set in terms of a set of mathematically or-\nthogonal spatial functions (the EOFs), each of which is as-\n1\nE. Hawkins & R. Sutton: Variability of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation\nsociated with a time series or \u2018principal component\u2019 (PC).\nLike the EOFs, the PCs are orthogonal. The decomposi-\ntion provided by conventional PCA has the property that\nthe first EOF\/PC pair, or \u2018mode\u2019, accounts for the largest\npossible fraction of the total variance in the dataset, while\nsubsequent EOF\/PC pairs account for maximal variance\nsubject to the constraint of orthogonality to the lower or-\nder modes.\nIn this study we investigate the efficient representation\nof the Atlantic THC using PCA. Specifically, we use PCA\nto examine THC variability in a long control integration\nof a coupled climate model (HadCM3). Because we are\ninterested in the three-dimensional structure of the THC,\nwe use a 3D state vector.\nSeveral previous studies have analysed various aspects\nof THC variability in HadCM3 and have shown variabil-\nity over a wide range of frequencies. Vellinga and Wu\n(2004) presented a mechanism to explain multi-decadal\nTHC variations through slow advection of salinity anoma-\nlies from the tropical Atlantic to the North Atlantic. They\nargued that the salinity anomalies are generated by THC-\ninduced shifts in the location of the ITCZ and that, in the\nNorth Atlantic, these anomalies act to reverse the phase of\nthe oscillation by changing the upper ocean density. Dong\nand Sutton (2005) described an irregular, damped THC\noscillation with a period of 25 years in the same model. In\nthis case the mechanism for phase reversal involves chan-\nges in the strength of the subpolar gyre, which modulate\nthe transport of saline waters into the Nordic Seas. The\nsubsequent changes in the density of the Nordic Seas alter\nthe THC.\nMulti-decadal variability of the THC has also been\nstudied in other coupled climate models. For example,\nDelworth et al. (1997) described a 40-80 year oscillation of\nthe THC in the GFDL model which was found to be asso-\nciated with fluctuations in the Arctic, Greenland Sea and\nin the intensity of the East Greenland Current. Further\nwork (Delworth and Greatbatch 2000) described a mech-\nanism similar to that later found by Dong and Sutton\n(2005). Delworth and Greatbatch (2000) demonstrated\nthat the timescale was determined by the ocean but that\nsurface flux forcing by the atmosphere was important for\nexciting the THC variability. Jungclaus et al. (2005) anal-\nysed multi-decadal variability of the overturning strength\nand associated heat transport in the ECHAM5\/MPI-OM\nmodel. In this model, which has a relatively high resolu-\ntion at high latitudes, they found that variations in the\nAtlantic salt and heat transport drive circulation chan-\nges in the Nordic Seas. These circulation changes modu-\nlate the storage and release of freshwater from the Arctic.\nVariations in the freshwater export from the Arctic to the\nconvection regions in the Labrador Sea modulate the over-\nturning strength, which in turn alters the Atlantic salt and\nheat transports.\nThere is also evidence from observations of multi-decadal\nvariability that may be caused by the THC. In partic-\nular, variability of northern hemisphere SSTs (especially\nin the Atlantic), with periods of 60-100 years, is found in\nproxy reconstructions of the climate and in the instrumen-\ntal record (e.g. Delworth and Mann 2000, Knight et al.\n2005). Polyakov et al. (2007) describe observations of\nstrong multi-decadal variability in the Arctic region during\nthe past 100 years and suggest that these changes may reg-\nulate the thermohaline circulation. Identifying the causes\nof this variability will aid future climate projections.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we\nbriefly describe the relevant features of the model used and\nintroduce our indices for characterising the overturning\nand heat transport. The methodology used to estimate\nthe three-dimensional EOFs is described in Section 3 and\nthe results are presented in Section 4. We conclude and\ndiscuss our results in Section 5.\n2 Model description and data\nIn the subsequent analysis we use annual mean data from\nan extended control run (1600 years) of the Hadley Centre\nclimate model (HadCM3, Gordon et al. 2000). The model\ndetails are given in Gordon et al. (2000) and references\ntherein, and here we give a brief summary. HadCM3 is\na global coupled ocean-atmosphere model with an atmo-\nspheric resolution of 2.5\u25e6 \u00d7 3.75\u25e6 and 19 vertical levels.\nThe ocean component has a resolution of 1.25\u25e6 \u00d7 1.25\u25e6\nwith 20 vertical levels (shown in Table 1). The outflow\nfrom the Mediterranean is not explicitly resolved in the\nmodel. Instead it is parameterised by mixing between ad-\njacent grid boxes on either side of the Straits of Gibraltar,\nin the upper 1200m, with the parameter chosen to simu-\nlate a transport of 1 Sv from the Mediterranean into the\nAtlantic (Gordon et al. 2000). The model does not require\nflux adjustment to maintain a stable climate.\n2.1 The mean state\nThe mean state of HadCM3 in the control run is shown for\npotential temperature (Fig. 1a) and salinity (Fig. 1b). In\nthe upper ocean, the Labrador Sea and Arctic Ocean are\nrelatively cool and fresh, while lower latitudes are warmer\nand saltier. Transport of warm salty waters into the North\nAtlantic can be seen on the eastern side of the basin,\nassociated with the North Atlantic drift. It is relevant\nfor the work in this paper that on the western side of\nthe Nordic Seas cool, fresh, Arctic water flows southward\nover warmer, saltier waters that originate in the Atlantic.\nGamiz-Fortis and Sutton (2007) showed that the tempera-\nture and salinity contrast between these two water masses\nis somewhat too large in HadCM3 (\u223c 3\u25e6K, 1.5 psu) as\ncompared to observations (\u223c 0.5\u2212 1\u25e6K, 1.0 psu). Also of\nnote are the fresh \u2018bowl\u2019 in the Beaufort Gyre region of\nthe Arctic, and the salty water protruding into the Barents\nSea from the Atlantic.\n2\nE. Hawkins & R.

(2000) for an earlier\nWorld Ocean Atlas, the mean SST field in the model re-\nproduces most of the characteristics of the observations in\nthe World Ocean Atlas (Levitus et al. 2006) to within 1\u25e6C\nover much of the ocean. The largest discrepancies, of over\n3\u25e6C (and up to 6\u25e6C), are in regions of large SST gradi-\nents, including the North Atlantic Current (NAC) region\nwhere the model is too cool. Just to the north of Iceland\nthe model is too warm by \u223c 3\u25e6C. The mean SSS field is\nwell modelled to within 1 psu in most regions (Pardaens\net al. 2003). The model is too salty in the Gulf Stream\nregion (\u223c 2 psu) and along the Northern Russian coast\n(up to 8 psu), and too fresh in the Beaufort Gyre region\nof the Arctic Ocean (\u223c 2 psu). Below the surface in the\nAtlantic the model is generally too warm (\u223c 2\u25e6C) and too\nsalty (\u223c 0.5 psu).\n2.2 Definition of climate indices\nWe define an MOC index (MOI) from the control run as\nthe detrended annual mean streamfunction at a depth of\n996m in the latitude band 27.5\u25e6\u2212 32.5\u25e6N, which is where\nthe ocean heat transport reaches a maximum. This defi-\nnition of a MOI was used by Dong and Sutton (2005) and\nhas a mean value of 16.3 Sv. The standard deviation of\nthis index is 1.0 Sv. A wavelet analysis of the overturning\nstrength for HadCM3 is shown in Figure 4 of Vellinga and\nWu (2004) and shows there is significant power on decadal\nand centennial timescales.\nWe also define an ocean heat transport (OHT) index\nas the total northward heat transport averaged over the\nnorth Atlantic (0-70\u25e6N). The MOI and OHT index have\na correlation of 0.77 and are in phase. This correlation\nincreases to 0.93 for decadally filtered indices. It is found\nthat the MOI defined here has a higher correlation with\nthe OHT than an MOC index based on the maximum\nvalue of the streamfunction over the Atlantic basin (as\nused by some other authors), which has a correlation of\n0.60 with the OHT. This correlation is relevant as it is the\nheat transport rather than the strength of the overturning\nwhich is more closely related to the ocean\u2019s influence on\nmid-to-high latitude climate.\n3 Calculation of Three-dimens-\nional EOFs for the THC\nEmpirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) are a commonly\nused tool in atmospheric and oceanic science when at-\ntempting to reduce the dimensionality of observations or\nmodel data.\nThe data anomalies (usually as a function of time) are\nrepresented by a matrix D. Mathematically, the EOFs are\nthe eigenvectors of the covariance (or correlation) matrix\nof D, i.e. the eigenvectors of DTD (or DTD\/\u03c3m\u03c3n, where\n\u03c3 denotes the standard deviation of the anomalies). In\npractice, these eigenvectors are calculated using a singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD) of D rather than calculating\nthe (usually) large matrix DTD.\nMost commonly, fields with two space dimensions (lati-\ntude, longitude) are considered, but bivariate vertical EOFs\nhave also been examined (e.g. Gavart and De Mey 1997).\nHere we consider how this methodology can be extended\nto include an extra spatial dimension in the ocean, i.e. in-\ncluding latitude, longitude and depth simultaneously. The\ncalculation of three-dimensional EOFs is a simple exten-\nsion of the two-dimensional case. The state vector in-\ncludes the data anomalies from each depth level at every\nlatitude and longitude grid point. In addition, our state\nvector includes both potential temperature and salinity.\nThe resulting EOF represents a pattern where the covari-\nance or correlation is maximised jointly in the domain and\nbetween variables.\n3.1 Weighting EOFs\nIn an EOF calculation for atmospheric or oceanic vari-\nables it is usual to ensure that each unit surface area is\ntreated equally with respect to its contribution to the total\nvariance. On a regular latitude-longitude grid the areas of\neach grid box are not equal, but proportional to the cosine\nof the latitude, so a weighting must be applied to down-\nweight those regions with smaller grid box areas. For the\nthree-dimensional case we also have to consider that the\nthicknesses of the model depth levels are not uniform (see\nTable 1). To ensure that each volume of water is treated\nequally, the depth level thicknesses, as well as the latitude\n3\nE. Hawkins & R.

The model bathymetry is plotted as a thin black contour.\neffect just described, need to be considered. Furthermore,\nwhen considering the multivariate case it is also necessary\nto consider the relative weighting of the different variables.\nTo ensure that each volume of water is treated equally,\nthe anomalies are weighted by,\nwijk =\n\u221a\n\u2206zk cos(\u03c6j), (1)\nwhere i, j, k denote the longitude, latitude and depth di-\nrections respectively, \u03c6 is the latitude, and \u2206z is the depth\nlevel thickness.\nIn this particular case we are using salinity anomalies,\nS\u2032, and potential temperature anomalies, \u03b8\u2032, and are in-\nterested in the behaviour of the Atlantic THC. As density\nanomalies drive the variation of the THC we will use a\nweighting scheme which depends on the relative contribu-\ntion to local density for each grid point, hence\nv\u03b8\n\u2032\nijk = sgn\n(\n\u03b1ijk\n\u03b2ijk\n) \u221a\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b1ijk\u03b2ijk\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223, (2)\nvS\n\u2032\nijk = 1, (3)\nwhere \u03b1 is the thermal expansion coefficient and \u03b2 is the\nhaline contraction coefficient, calculated at each grid point\nby using the time mean values of S and \u03b8. The square\nroots in Eqns. 1 and 2 are required as we are estimating\nthe eigenvectors of the product DTD; the covariance (or\ncorrelation) matrix will thus have the latitude, level thick-\nness and density contribution weighting required. The sgn\n4\nE. Hawkins & R. Sutton: Variability of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation\nterm in Eqn. 2 is required as \u03b1 can be negative, so we take\nthe modulus of \u03b1\/\u03b2 inside the square root.\nThe total weight for each grid point is then the product\nof wijk and the appropriate vijk . The weighting is applied\nto D prior to carrying out the singular value decomposi-\ntion from which the EOFs are obtained. The EOFs are\nthen deweighted by the same factor before analysis to en-\nsure the data has real physical units.\n3.2 Normalisation of EOFs\nWhen using more than one variable, as in this example,\nit is necessary to remove the effect of the arbitrary choice\nof units. In the covariance case this is achieved by nor-\nmalising each field by the spatial average of the temporal\nstandard deviation of the field.\nWe first computed covariance EOFs and found that\nthey were dominated by variability in the upper ocean,\nand the leading PCs were not well correlated with the\nMOI. To highlight more deeply reaching basin-scale dy-\nnamics we therefore tried correlation EOFs. In a correla-\ntion EOF analysis, the state vector is normalised so that\nthe anomalies at each grid point have unit standard de-\nviation in time. This approach vastly improved the cor-\nrelation between the PCs and the MOI and so is adopted\nhere.\n3.3 Robustness of EOFs\nThe data considered are annual mean fields of potential\ntemperature and salinity which have been detrended using\na second order polynomial over the time period analysed.\nWe do not use the first 500 years of the control run to\nminimise the effects of spin-up in the deep ocean, and\nfind that using a second order polynomial to detrend the\ndata gives a significantly better correlation between the\nresulting principal components and the MOI. We use the\nremaining 1100 years (nominally the years 2350 - 3449) of\nthe control run to include as many multi-decadal cycles as\npossible.\nOur chosen domain is 20\u25e6S - 90\u25e6N and 100\u25e6W - 20\u25e6E\nto include most of the Atlantic (the small part of the Pa-\ncific in this region is masked out). We chose to use twelve\ndepth levels down to 1501m depth (1809m for the bottom\nof the level, see Table 1) in the EOF calculation so that\nmost of the primary overturning cell is included (see, e.g.\nFig 1a of Vellinga and Wu 2004). The two levels not in-\ncluded in the calculation are levels 2 (15m) and 4 (35m)\nand this is done due to computational constraints. The\nstrong coherency between levels near the surface (levels 1\nand 3 in the leading EOF have a spatial correlation of 0.98)\nmeans that the results are insensitive to this omission.\nIt is important to ensure that the estimated EOFs are\nrobust, and not an artifact of choices made for time pe-\nriod used, region chosen, depth level selection, detrending\nor weighting schemes. We therefore performed many tests\nincluding changing the lowest depth level included, the\nnumber of depth levels, the time period in the control run,\nthe order of the polynomial used for detrending and tried\ndifferent weighting schemes. Although the detailed results\ndiffer between these tests, all give a reasonably consistent\npattern for the leading EOF, and so we can be confident\nabout the robustness of this EOF. There is slightly more\nvariation in the second EOF (not shown), but these dif-\nferences are not enough to affect our later conclusions.\nThere is significant variation in the higher EOFs, which\nis not surprising as different weighting schemes, for exam-\nple, can easily give rise to rotations within the sub-space\nspanned by the leading eigenvectors. Consequently, we\nwill only consider the leading two EOFs further.\nFinally, if the calculation is repeated using density and\nspiciness (Flament 2002) as the variables in the EOF cal-\nculation (instead of temperature and salinity) the result-\ning PCs are also remarkably similar. This finding gives\nus more confidence that the method is representing the\nunderlying dynamics well.\n4 Results\n4.1 Bivariate three-dimensional EOFs\nWe present a bivariate correlation EOF analysis for 1100\nyears of potential temperature and salinity data on twelve\ndepth levels to 1501m depth. The calculated principal\ncomponent time series have been normalised to have unit\nstandard deviation, and the respective EOFs are scaled to\nmaintain total variance.\n4.1.1 Eigenspectrum\nFig. 2 shows the eigenspectrum (blue line) and accumu-\nlated fraction of variance explained (green line) for the\nfirst ten EOFs. The leading EOF accounts for around\n15% of the total variance, and the first ten EOFs together\naccount for just over 50%. Given the size of the state ma-\ntrix (1100\u00d7105150 elements), it is not surprising that the\npercentages of total variance explained are not large.\nThe red line in Fig. 2 shows the cumulative fraction of\nvariance of the decadally filtered MOI explained, at zero\nlag, by the first ten EOFs, and shows that only the first\ntwo PCs have a high correlation with the MOI at zero\nlag. In fact, these are the only PCs to have significant\n(> 99%) correlation with the filtered MOI at any lag up\nto \u00b150 years using a t-test (not shown). Note that at zero\nlag PC2 explains most variance of the MOI. However, as\nwe now discuss, if we vary the lag then the picture changes.\n5\nE. Hawkins & R.

There is multi-decadal1 variability in each PC,\nthough PC2 has more high frequency (decadal) oscilla-\ntions than PC1. The EOF analysis has naturally selected\nthe lowest frequency modes, since these explain the most\nvariance.\nFig. 3b shows PC1 and the decadally filtered MOI and\nOHT index. PC1 has been shifted to maximise the corre-\nlation (0.74) with the MOI, with the MOI leading the un-\nfiltered PC1 by 20 years. Allowing for the lag, this leading\nprincipal component thus explains 54% of the variance of\nthe MOI on decadal timescales. This correlation increases\nto 0.86 (74%) if considering a 30 year filtered MOI. The\ncorrelations are similar if using the OHT index rather than\nthe MOI.\nFor PC2, we find the largest (absolute) correlation on\ndecadal timescales of -0.61 when PC2 lags the MOI by\n1 year (not shown). The relationship between the two\nleading PCs is considered further in Section 4.1.4.\nThe higher modes (3 - 10) are mostly dominated by\nsurface and very deep ocean signals (not shown). One\nof the strengths of our EOF approach is that no prior\ninformation about the form of the MOC has been used,\nyet a high correlation is found with the MOI.\n4.1.3 EOF patterns\nThe structure of the leading EOF is shown in Fig. 4.2 It\nillustrates the temperature and salinity features present\napproximately 20 years after an MOI maximum, per unit\nchange in PC1. The features are extremely coherent over\nmany of the depth levels, especially near the surface and so\n1Note that the phrase \u2018multi-decadal\u2019 also includes centennial\nvariability.\n2The structure of the second EOF is not shown here, but can be\nseen later in the fourth row (\u03c8 = 3pi\n2\n) of Figs. 7, 8, with reversed\nsign.\nwe show only a representative subset of six levels. In fact,\nthere is a negligible difference in the patterns obtained if\nwe only use these six layers in the EOF calculation itself.\nThe figures show that in this phase most of the subpo-\nlar gyre is anomalously warm and salty near the surface\nwith a peak in the North Atlantic Current (NAC) region of\naround 0.3K and 0.1 psu, suggesting increased advection\nfrom the Gulf Stream region or a northward displacement\nof the NAC front. In the west at low latitudes there are\ncool, fresh anomalies which peak at around 666m (0.3K\nand 0.05 psu). In many regions the temperature and salin-\nity anomalies are density compensating, but an exception\nis found in the Labrador Sea at around 300m where the\nanomalies are both cool and salty, indicating high density.\nPositive density anomalies are also found in the Nordic\nSeas (where salinity variations dominate over variations\nin temperature, not shown). Thus at this phase there\nis an enhanced meridional density gradient between the\nhigh latitude North Atlantic and lower latitudes, consis-\ntent with the relatively strong state of the MOC (Thorpe\net al. 2001).\nThe section of the Arctic included in the analysis shows\nan intriguing fresh (and hence low density) anomaly (up\nto 0.25 psu) extending from the surface to a depth of\n300m. This anomaly suggests that variability in the Arc-\ntic may respond to, or be part of, the processes which\ngovern the multi-decadal variability of the MOC. Jung-\nclaus et al. (2005) argued that the Arctic Ocean plays an\nimportant role in MOC variability in the ECHAM5\/MPI-\nOM model, but this possibility has not previously been\nrecognised in HadCM3. (Wu et al. (2004) suggest that\nthe recent observed freshening trend in the North Atlantic\noriginates in the Arctic Ocean in HadCM3, but this is due\nto anthropogenic effects rather than the natural variability\ndiscussed here.) Polyakov et al. (2007) showed that obser-\nvations of the Arctic climate system over the past century\nhave considerable variability on multi-decadal timescales.\n6\nE. Hawkins & R.

The MOI and OHT index have been decadally filtered.\n4.1.4 PC1 - PC2 sub-space analysis\nTo examine further the relationship between the leading\nPCs it is useful to examine phase space diagrams for pairs\nof PCs. Fig. 5 shows this analysis for the PC1-PC2 sub-\nspace, where the PCs have been decadally filtered. The\nblue line represents a 214-year period (years 64 - 277)\nwhere there is a clear circular feature indicating that these\nPCs are oscillating in quadrature for this time period. The\nred line shows a 216-year period (years 875 - 1090) which\nshows another, larger, circular feature. The other time pe-\nriods are more noisy and are shown as grey lines and show\nno immediate sign of this coherent oscillation. Both of the\ncoherent oscillations last for about 1 14 cycles but start in\ndifferent regions of the sub-space. It is also interesting to\nnote that they occur at times when the PC variability has\nlargest amplitude. The black line in Fig. 5 indicates the\naxis of the MOI extrema, which is found by plotting the\nMOI against the phase of the oscillation in this sub-space\n(not shown). These results might indicate the presence of\ndifferent regimes of variability,3 and are of great interest\nfor predictability. Fig. 5 suggests, for example, that the\nevolution of the MOC may more predictable when starting\nfrom an extreme minimum in the MOC or a large nega-\ntive value of PC1, than it is for initial conditions located\nin other regions of the sub-space. Collins and Sinha (2003)\nalso suggested that there might be enhanced predictabil-\nity at certain phases of MOC variation in HadCM3. No\nsimilar features are seen in sub-spaces involving the higher\nPCs.\nTo understand whether this coherent oscillation is a\nconsistent feature of the variability, we analyse the sub-\n3For example, the figure could be evidence of a Hopf bifurcation;\nthe system transitions from a regime with a single equilibrium state\nto a regime with a limit cycle, excited by stochastic fluctuations\n(Dijkstra, personal communication).\nspace tendencies. Fig. 6 shows the same evolution (grey\nline) in the sub-space as in Fig. 5, and the arrows show\nthe mean sub-space tendencies, Tn, averaged over regions\nof the sub-space, where\nTn(t) = PCn(t+ 1)\u2212 PCn(t) (4)\nfor n = 1, 2, and t is the year. The mean vectors ([T1, T2])\nare plotted at the mean location in each particular region\nof the sub-space. The labelled contours indicate the num-\nber of points included in the meaning. The arrows show\na very coherent circular oscillation in the outer regions of\nthe sub-space as expected from Fig. 5. Surprisingly, the\nvectors are also coherent in the low amplitude, and more\nnoisy region near the centre of the sub-space. This finding\nsuggests that it may just be the amplitude of this circular\noscillation which changes over time. The time taken for\none complete orbit is roughly constant (\u223c150 years) with\namplitude, i.e. it resembles solid body rotation. Finer\nscale versions of the figure show similar consistency but\nare more noisy (not shown).\nWe do not have enough complete cycles to distinguish\nwhether the amplitude of the oscillation can take any\nvalue, or whether there are indeed different amplitude\nregimes. In either case the circular, low-frequency, os-\ncillation seems to a fundamental feature of the variability\nand merits further analysis.\n4.2 A mechanism for low frequency vari-\nability\nWe now analyse the evolution in the PC1-PC2 sub-space\nto identify the physical processes responsible for the co-\nherent oscillations identified above.\n7\nE.

Note:\nsalinity colour scale changes to smaller values for the bottom three levels.\n4.2.1 Evolution of anomalies\nAs these coherent oscillations are associated with multi-\ndecadal MOI variability, the higher frequency variability\ncan be effectively removed by assuming an simplified tra-\njectory in the sub-space. We therefore assume a circular\ntrajectory in the PC1-PC2 sub-space and combine the re-\nspective EOF fields for a particular phase, \u03c8, using\nEOF\u03c8 = cos(\u03c8)\u00d7 EOF1 + sin(\u03c8)\u00d7 EOF2. (5)\nwhere \u03c8 is defined relative to [PC1, PC2] = [1.0, 0.0]. The\nevolution of anomalies in the PC1-PC2 sub-space is shown\nfor temperature (Fig. 7) and salinity (Fig. 8), at a selection\nof depths.4 The phases shown are \u03c8 = [ 3pi4 , pi,\n5pi\n4 ,\n3pi\n2 ,\n7pi\n4 ],\nand thus cover 180\u25e6 of the oscillation. The initial phase is\nroughly at a minimum of the MOC, and the evolution thr-\nough to an MOC maximum is shown. Note that although\nwe will refer to these phases as the \u2018MOC\u2019 they are derived\nfrom the simplified circular trajectory. The reverse phases\ncan be obtained by simply changing the sign of the anom-\nalies. Note also that the length of time elapsed between\npanels is not necessarily constant. The anomalies in the\nArctic outside the sector 100\u25e6W - 20\u25e6E are not included\nin the EOF calculation but can be calculated by regress-\n4Fig. 16 is an animated version of these figures.\n8\nE.

These regression coefficients are included in\nthe plots for completeness.\nThese figures show that at an MOC minimum (top\nrow) the largest anomalies in the upper ocean are found in\nthe NAC region (cool and fresh), the Arctic (salty) and in\nthe Nordic seas where it is fresh and mostly cool. At 300m\nand below there are also prominent warm, salty anoma-\nlies extending from the Gulf of Mexico along the coast\nto South America. At 1500m and (less clearly) at 666m\nthese anomalies appear to extend continuously along the\nwestern boundary of the North Atlantic, reaching up to\nthe Labrador Sea. It is likely that the western boundary\nanomalies are related to the propagation of Kelvin-type\nwaves, which are excited by changes in deep water forma-\ntion in the North Atlantic. In particular, a reduction in\ndeep water formation, associated with a minimum in the\nMOC, is expected to lead to a deepening of isopycnals,\nisotherms and isohalines (Johnson and Marshall 2002). In\nregions such as along the coast of South America where\ntemperature and salinity decrease with depth (see Fig. 1),\nthis deepening will cause increases in temperature and\nsalinity at a fixed depth, as is seen in the Figs. 7 and\n8. The effects of similar deepening can be seen in North\nAtlantic water hosing experiments, e.g. see Fig 7 of Ottera\net al. (2004).\nAt and below 666m the western boundary anomalies\n\u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1 2\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n20\n20\n20\n20\n40\n40\n40\n80\n80\n0.1\u03c3\/yr\nPC1\nPC\n2\nFigure 6: The mean sub-space tendencies (arrows) of the\ntwo leading PCs, averaged over square regions of sub-space\nwith unit height and width.

The vector\ntendencies are centred on the mean position in each region\nof sub-space. The contours indicate the number of points\nincluded in the average in each region of sub-space. The\ngrey line is the phase space trajectory as shown in Fig. 5.\nThe cross is at [PC1, PC2] = [0, 0].\ncontrast with anomalies of opposite sign on the eastern\nside of the basin; these eastern anomalies stretch from\nmid-latitudes up into the Arctic. At 1500m there is a\nlarge low salinity anomaly that reaches west from Iberia.\nIt is unclear whether this feature is related to anomalous\nsalinity transport from the Mediterranean Sea. Also at\n1500m, on the southern side of the Denmark Strait there is\na small tongue of cool, fresh, water, which may be evidence\nof anomalies in the overflow from the Nordic Seas.\nAs the oscillation evolves from MOC minimum to MOC\nmaximum the large scale pattern of anomalies is gradually\nreversed. In many regions, e.g. the NAC, the evolution\nresembles a standing oscillation, but there are also some\npropagating features, e.g. at 666m the gradual extension\nof positive salinity and temperature anomalies from the\nnortheast Atlantic into the Arctic (also see the animated\nanomalies in Fig. 16). Polyakov et al. (2005) observed the\npropagation of temperature anomalies into the Arctic over\nseveral years in a similar manner.\nThe swings in temperature and salinity are associated\nwith swings in density. Vellinga and Wu (2004), following\nThorpe et al. (2001), showed that in HadCM3 the evo-\nlution of the density field, vertically integrated from the\n9\nE. Hawkins & R. Sutton: Variability of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation\nsurface to 800m is closely related to the evolution of the\nMOC. (Note that in HadCM3, 800m corresponds to the\nmaximum depth of the Denmark Strait). Fig. 9 shows this\nintegral; we see that the MOC minimum is associated with\nnegative density anomalies in the subpolar gyre, with the\nlargest anomalies found near the coast of Greenland in the\nLabrador Sea, Irminger Sea and on the western side of the\nNordic Seas. Positive anomalies are found further south,\nparticularly in the region of the subtropical gyre. Thus\nthere is a negative anomaly in the meridional density gra-\ndient. The lower panels show that this gradient gradually\nreverses sign as the MOC anomaly reverses. Interestingly,\nthe figure also shows large density anomalies in the Arc-\ntic Ocean, which peak at a similar time to the minima or\nmaxima in the MOC, and are out of phase with the vari-\nations in the subpolar gyre. These Arctic variations were\nnot discussed by Vellinga and Wu (2004).\nFig. 9 implies that the key question of what mecha-\nnism controls the variations of the MOC can be reduced\nto the narrower question of what controls the density at\nhigh latitudes on multi-decadal timescales. An answer to\nthis question was provided by Vellinga and Wu (2004).\nHowever, as we will discuss shortly, our analyses suggest\na mechanism which features some important differences\nfrom their proposal.\nTo understand the variations in vertically integrated\ndensity we now focus in detail on the western Nordic Seas;\nour analyses have shown that density variations in this re-\ngion are a precursor of changes in the MOC. Fig. 10 shows\nthe evolution of vertically integrated density anomalies on\nthe western side of the Nordic Seas at a latitude of 72.5\u25e6\nN, over a full cycle of the MOC variation. Also shown\nare the separate contributions to the variations in density\nthat come from variations in temperature and variations\nin salinity. The figure reveals a number of interesting fea-\ntures. First, the variations in density in this region lead\nthe MOC by pi\/4. Secondly, the variations in density are\ninfluenced both by variations in temperature and by vari-\nations in salinity, with salinity consistently making the\nlargest contribution. Thirdly, the contributions from tem-\nperature and salinity are not in phase. Perhaps surpris-\ningly, in view of their smaller quantitative contribution to\ndensity, the variations in temperature are in phase with\nthe variations in density, while the variations in salinity\nlag by pi\/4. (Hence the salinity in this region is in phase\nwith the MOC).\nThat variations in density in the western Nordic Seas\nlead variations in the MOC suggests that this region plays\nan important role in driving the MOC variability. Such\na scenario is plausible in view of the potential for density\nanomalies in this region to influence the overflows from the\nNordic Seas, to modulate deep water formation, and to ex-\ncite boundary disturbances that can propagate around the\nbasin. Fig. 10, however, indicates that the processes con-\ntrolling density in this region are quite complex, involving\na subtle interplay of temperature and salinity variations.\nOur next task, therefore, is to understand these variations.\n4.2.2 The role of convection in the Nordic Seas\nAs noted in the discussion of Fig. 1, in the western Nordic\nSeas, cool, fresh, Arctic water flows southward over warmer,\nsaltier, waters of Atlantic origin. Fig. 11 shows profiles of\ntemperature and salinity for this region, again at 72.5\u25e6N.\nPanels a and c show the time mean profiles. The cool,\nfresh surface waters are clearly seen, and the subsurface\ntemperature maximum, peaking at a depth of \u223c 300m,\nis another prominent feature. An important consequence\nof this subsurface maximum is that vertical mixing as-\nsociated with convection can raise surface temperature\n(Gamiz-Fortis and Sutton 2007).\nFig. 11b,d show the evolution of anomalous tempera-\nture and salinity profiles from MOC minimum to MOC\nmaximum. An obvious feature of the temperature profiles\nis the anti-phase variations between the near surface wa-\nters and the subsurface waters between 200\u22121000m. This\nvertical structure is precisely what one would expect as a\nresult of variations in vertical mixing, given the mean pro-\nfile in shown in panel a. At an MOC minimum the near\nsurface waters are anomalously cool and the subsurface is\nanomalously warm. As the cycle evolves, surface warming\nand subsurface cooling suggests a progressive increase in\nvertical mixing until shortly before the MOC maximum.\nThe phase (\u03c8 = 3pi2 ) when the temperature stratification\nis at a minimum is also the phase when sea surface tem-\nperatures are at a maximum (not just at 72.5\u25e6 N, but\nover most of the Nordic Seas, see Fig. 7). However, the\ncontribution of temperature anomalies to the vertically in-\ntegrated density (Fig. 10) is at a maximum because it is\ndominated by the subsurface cooling rather than the near\nsurface warming.\nIn the absence of any transport effects or surface flux\nanomalies, we would not expect changes in convection\nalone to alter the vertically integrated density. However,\nthis statement is only valid if one integrates down to the\nbottom of the layer in which mixing occurs. When com-\nputing Fig. 10 we only integrated down to 800m because\nthis depth corresponds to the bottom of the Denmark\nStrait in HadCM3, and deeper water masses are unlikely to\ndirectly affect the transports through the Strait. Fig. 11b,\nhowever, suggests that there is significant mixing to greater\ndepths. If the integral is extended in depth we find that\nthe contribution from temperature changes to the changes\nin vertically averaged density is further reduced relative\nto the contribution from salinity (not shown). This find-\ning is consistent with our suggestion that the variations in\ntemperature can be explained primarily by variations in\nvertical mixing.\nWe would expect the changes in vertical mixing to af-\nfect the salinity profiles as well as the temperature pro-\nfiles. In particular, in view of the mean structure shown\nin Fig. 11c, we would expect increases in vertical mixing\n10\nE. Hawkins & R.

Fig. 11d shows that, as the cycle evolves from\nMOC minimum to MOC maximum, increases in near sur-\nface salinity are seen initially, but subsurface decreases are\nnot (except a very small decrease from \u03c8 = 3pi4 to \u03c8 = pi).\nThis finding suggests that changes in convection are not\nthe only important process affecting salinity in this region.\nCloser inspection of Fig. 11d shows that below a few hun-\ndred metres salinity generally increases from MOC min-\nimum to MOC maximum. The most likely explanation\nfor these increases is that they reflect increased transport\nof Atlantic water into the Nordic Seas, in response to the\nprogressive acceleration of the MOC. Although this trans-\nport is concentrated at the eastern side of the basin, part\nof the Atlantic water subsequently spreads westward thr-\nough advection and lateral mixing.\nAn exception to the general pattern of subsurface salin-\nity increases is found in the initial stage following a MOC\nminimum (between \u03c8 = 3pi4 and \u03c8 = pi). During this inter-\nval there is a small decrease in salinity below about 500m,\n11\nE. Hawkins & R.

The model\nbathymetry is shown with a thin black contour.\nbut there are large increases near the surface. What is\nthe source of this additional salinity at the surface? The\nfact that the increases are found in the near-surface wa-\nters, suggests that the origin is likely to be the outflow\nof Arctic water in the East Greenland Current. Fig. 8\n(top row) shows that at an MOC minimum near surface\nsalinity in the Arctic is at a maximum. If the anomalous\ntransport of salinity out of the Arctic were (roughly) pro-\nportional to the salinity gradient between the Arctic and\nthe Nordic Seas, we would anticipate enhanced southward\ntransport of salinity into the Nordic Seas at this stage. A\nrigorous proof of the mechanism we propose would require\na complete budget analysis for salinity, temperature and\ndensity in the Nordic Seas. Unfortunately we lack the nec-\nessary diagnostics to perform such calculations. However,\nwe have been able to examine the salinity tendency due\nto advection. We found that 20 years before a maximum\nin the MOI the advective tendency shows positive values\nstretching along the northeast coast of Greenland, with\nnegative values in the Arctic north of Fram Strait (not\n12\nE.

This pattern supports our hypothesis of anoma-\nlous salinity advection out of the Arctic.\n4.2.3 Summary of mechanism\nWe can now summarise our understanding of the processes\nthat govern the density variations in the western Nordic\nSeas, beginning at an MOC minimum (these are also sum-\nmarised in a schematic diagram in Fig. 12):\n1. At the MOC minimum, enhanced transport of salin-\nity out of the Arctic in the East Greenland Current\ncauses surface salinity to rise. The increase in sur-\nface salinity promotes enhanced convection, causing\nsurface temperature to rise and subsurface tempera-\nture to fall. The vertically integrated density (down\nto 800m) increases (primarily due to the increase of\nsalinity, with additional contribution from the de-\ncrease in subsurface temperature), which causes the\nMOC to increase.\n2. The increase of the MOC causes increased trans-\nport of Atlantic water into the Nordic Seas. This\nincreased transport causes salinity to rise, further\nincreasing the vertically integrated density, and act-\ning as a positive feedback on the MOC.\n3. Phase reversal. The increase in the MOC is associ-\nated with a decay of the major near surface salinity\nanomaly in the Arctic, and thus we expect a decrease\nin the anomalous transport of salinity in the East\nGreenland Current. This decrease causes freshen-\ning of the near surface waters in the western Nordic\nSeas (as can be seen in Fig. 11d for phases between\n\u03c8 = 5pi4 and \u03c8 =\n7pi\n4 ), which progressively weakens\nconvection. The weakening of convection causes sea\nsurface temperature to fall and subsurface temper-\nature to rise (Fig. 11c at \u03c8 = 7pi4 ). The vertically\nintegrated density decreases (primarily due to the\n13\nE. Hawkins & R.

Sutton: Variability of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation\nincrease of subsurface temperature) and the MOC\nfollows.\nIn the above account the transport of salinity from\nthe Atlantic into the Nordic Seas provides a positive feed-\nback on the MOC, while the storage and release of salinity\nanomalies in the Arctic provides a delayed negative feed-\nback, and probably sets the dominant timescale. This pro-\nposed mechanism differs from that suggested by Vellinga\nand Wu (2004), in which the transport to high latitudes of\nsalinity anomalies generated in the tropical Atlantic pro-\nvided the delayed negative feedback and there was no role\nfor the Arctic. We have not attempted in this study to ex-\nplain the processes that control the build up and release\nof near surface salinity anomalies in the Arctic, except\nto assume that the release is approximately proportional\nto the anomalous gradient of surface salinity between the\nArctic and the Nordic Seas. We suspect that the build\nup of Arctic salinity anomalies is a lagged response to the\nchanges in the MOC. The evidence from Fig. 8 of deep\nsalinity anomalies propagating from the Nordic Seas into\nthe Arctic provides some support for this suggestion (also\nsee the animated anomalies in Fig. 16).\nA similar low frequency ocean mode, also excited by\nthe atmosphere, was found in the ECHAM5\/MPI-OM mo-\ndel (Jungclaus et al. 2005). The mechanism identified also\nrelies on changes in the storage and release of freshwater\nfrom the Arctic Ocean as the key feedback. There are\nstrong similarities in the evolution of their mode with that\ndescribed here (compare their Fig. 9 with our Figs. 7, 8).\nHowever, in HadCM3 the largest variability in convec-\ntion is found in the Nordic Seas, whereas in their model\nthe Labrador Sea is the main convection site and this re-\nquires differences in the mechanism. Delworth et al. (1997)\nalso described how variations in salinity in the Arctic and\nGreenland Seas can affect the THC in a coupled model.\nAn important question is whether this type of variabil-\nity is present in the real Arctic system. Polyakov et al.\n(2004) describe observed multi-decadal changes in prop-\nerties of the inflow of Atlantic water into the Arctic and\nhow these changes can further affect the outflows into the\nNordic Seas in a similar way to that described here, though\nthe observed time series last just one cycle and appears to\nbe influenced by anthropogenic signals.\n4.3 Ocean-atmosphere interactions and im-\npacts on climate\nThe mechanism we have described is an internal mode of\nocean variability. It is likely to be influenced by stochastic\nfluctuations arising in the atmosphere but does not rely on\nocean-atmosphere interactions for its existence (i.e. it is\nnot a coupled mode in the way that ENSO is). It does,\nhowever, have some weak impacts on climate. Fig. 13\nshows lagged regressions of SST, MSLP, surface air tem-\nperature and precipitation onto the leading principal com-\nponent, PC1, for the full 1100 years analysed. The partic-\nular lag shown is around 10 years before an MOC maxi-\nmum and is chosen to show the largest signals. The units\ngiven are per unit change in PC1.\nJust before an MOC maximum there is a general warm-\ning of the SSTs north of the equator, particularly in the\nNAC region (\u223c 0.3 \u2212 0.5\u25e6C) and in the Nordic seas (\u223c\n0.3\u22120.4\u25e6C), and a small cooling to the south of the equa-\ntor. There is a small, but statistically significant, MSLP\nreduction (\u223c 0.3mb) over the convection region in the\nNordic seas, which would project onto the positive phase\nof the NAO. This is also associated with a \u223c 1\u25e6C warm-\ning of the air temperature and a \u223c 6% decrease in the ice\nfraction (not shown) in the same region. There is also a\ngeneral warming of northern hemisphere air temperature\nof \u223c 0.1\u25e6C, which is enhanced to \u223c 0.4\u25e6C over the NAC.\nThe position of the Atlantic ITCZ varies roughly in phase\nwith the MOC, with a northward movement associated\nwith a high MOC. There is also increased precipitation\nover the warm convection region in the Nordic seas. The\nprecipitation anomalies in the tropics and in the Nordic\nseas are a few percent of the local mean values, consistent\nwith the general picture of weak impacts on climate.\nThe climate impacts illustrated in Fig. 13 are simi-\nlar to those identified in HadCM3 by Vellinga and Wu\n(2004) (their Fig. 6) and Knight et al. (2005, 2006). How-\never, these authors did not highlight the fact that SST\nand variations in the Nordic Seas lead the MOC. This fact\nis illustrated by the solid lines in Fig. 14, which shows\nthe cross-correlation between an index of Nordic Seas SST\n(averaged over the region 65\u25e6N - 80\u25e6N and 25\u25e6W - 0\u25e6W)\nand the MOI for different time periods. For the two pe-\nriods of coherent oscillations the maximum correlation is\nfound when the SST index leads the MOI by 5-8 years. In\nthe intervening period the cross-correlation shows a sim-\nilar asymmetry but is flat between about 0-5 years. The\npeak correlations are notably higher (0.88 and 0.62, as\ncompared to 0.44) for the two periods of coherent oscil-\nlation. The surface salinity in the same region leads the\nMOC by 10-20 years during the coherent oscillating pe-\nriods (dashed lines in Fig. 14), consistent with the idea\nthat the anomalous salinity transport from the Arctic is\nthe trigger for convection.\nThe idea that climate impacts at high latitudes lead\nrather than lag the MOC is at odds with the traditional\nidea that increased poleward heat transport by the ocean\nwill cause an accumulation of heat at high latitudes and,\nperhaps after some delay, an enhanced heat flux into the\natmosphere. However, the explanation of Fig. 14 follows\ndirectly from the mechanism outlined in Section 4.2.3. Be-\ncause of the subsurface temperature maximum, high SST\nin the Nordic Seas is a signature of convection. Further-\nmore, SST varies in phase with the vertically integrated\ndensity. It follows that SST provides a proxy for the vari-\nations in density that drive the MOC.\nAssociated with the SST anomalies in the Nordic Seas\n15\nE. Hawkins & R.

The associated warming of the atmosphere is\nlikely to be the cause of the negative SLP anomaly seen\nin Fig. 13b (see Gamiz-Fortis and Sutton (2007) for fur-\nther evidence and discussion). These air-sea interactions\nhave the potential to amplify convection through positive\nfeedbacks, as illustrated in Fig. 15. Convection leads to\nelevated SST, thus increasing the cooling of ocean surface\nand promoting further convection. This feedback could be\nenhanced by two further effects of raised SST: 1) melting\nof sea-ice, which exposes more ocean surface and thereby\nfurther enhances cooling; 2) the atmospheric response of\nnegative SLP, which will cause surface Ekman divergence\nand therefore upwelling in the ocean, which will in turn\nact to reduce stratification and further promote convec-\ntion. These postulated positive feedbacks are fast pro-\ncesses, and are therefore unlikely to be involved in setting\nthe timescale of the MOC variability in HadCM3; how-\never, they could play a role in setting the amplitude.\nDetailed comparison with observations is beyond the\nscope of this study, but it is interesting to note that the\npattern of high latitude warming seen in Fig. 13c shows\nconsiderable similarity to the pattern of observed warming\nbetween 1920 and 1940 that was described by Johannessen\net al. (2004) (see their Figures 2a and 2b). The similar-\nity supports the hypothesis that this warming was a fea-\nture of natural climate variability related to the Atlantic\nMOC (also see Delworth and Knutson 2000). (Bengtsson\net al. (2004) describe an alternative hypothesis in which\nthe focus is on regional air-sea interactions rather than\nbasin-scale MOC change.) Knight et al. (2005, 2006) de-\n16\nE. Hawkins & R.

Our key findings using HadCM3 can be summarised\nas follows:\n\u2022 The two leading modes explain nearly 60% of the\ndecadal variance of the MOI at zero lag. Allow-\ning for lags the leading mode alone can explain 54%\nof the decadal variance or 74% of the multi-decadal\nvariance of the MOI.\n\u2022 A trajectory plotted in the sub-space of the lead-\ning EOFs showed evidence of coherent oscillations.\nSuch episodes are of great interest for predictability.\nThere are therefore possible applications in terms\nof a future forecasting system for the THC, and po-\ntentially, socio-economic benefits through predicting\nthe climate impacts. This analysis also suggested\nthat there are may be different regimes of natural\nvariability of the THC in HadCM3, possibly due to\nthe presence of a bifurcation.\n\u2022 The mechanism identified to explain this multi-decadal\nvariability (see schematics in Fig. 12 and Fig. 15) is a\npurely ocean mode, controlled by changes in convec-\ntion in the Nordic seas. The essence of the proposed\noscillation is:\n\u25e6 convection in the Nordic Seas, likely triggered\nby anomalous salinity export from the Arctic,\ncreates high density anomalies which influence\nthe MOC,\n\u25e6 rapid positive feedbacks on convection associ-\nated with the effects of convection on SST, sea\nice and air-sea fluxes help maintain convection,\n\u25e6 the meridional density gradient rises, along with\nthe MOC. The acceleration of the MOC is as-\nsociated with increased transport of saline At-\nlantic water into the convection region, acting\ninitially as a positive feedback,\n\u25e6 the convection is capped by anomalous fresh\nwater, likely exported from the Arctic, and the\nphase is reversed.\nThis mechanism is different to that described by Vel-\nlinga and Wu (2004) who argued that a shift in the\nposition of the Atlantic ITCZ provided the neces-\nsary negative feedback on the low frequency MOC\nvariations in HadCM3.\n\u2022 The surface climate effects of this mechanism include\nchanges in SST, ice extent and air temperature, es-\npecially in the Nordic seas, a shift in the position\n17\nE. Hawkins & R. Sutton: Variability of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation\nof the ITCZ, as well as a weak feedback onto the\nNAO. Surprisingly, we have found that the surface\nclimate signals often lead changes in the overturning\nstrength.\n\u2022 There are qualitative similarities between these mod-\nelled climate signatures and observations of multi-\ndecadal variability in the atmosphere and ocean. De-\ntailed, more quantitative, comparisons are deferred\nto a future study.\nWe finally note that this study has used a global cli-\nmate model of moderate resolution and there are certainly\nimportant processes which HadCM3 does not resolve ade-\nquately. Applying the techniques developed here on higher\nresolution models will be valuable to explore the robust-\nness of the results. The identified potential predictability\nof this mode will be explored in a further paper.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Simon Tett for providing the HadCM3 control\nrun data and the two reviewers for their suggestions to\nimprove the paper.
