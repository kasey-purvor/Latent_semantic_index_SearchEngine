The \npresent most prominent changes we are witnessing and which have recently been confirmed by \nthe fourth IPCC summary report (IPCC 2007) are those caused by global climate change. Not \nleast important and related to climate change are the changes in the use of our environment and \nnatural resources. The Convention on Biological Diversity which was agreed in 1992, and more \nrecently, the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which carried out a first global \u2018scientific \nappraisal  of  the  condition  and  trends  in  the  world\u2019s  ecosystems  and  services  they \nprovide\u2019(Millenium  Ecosystem  Assessment  2005),  demonstrate  a  growing  international \nawareness in the importance of maintaining \u2018healthy\u2019 ecosystems to preserve life as we know it \ntoday.\nIn Europe several national and international legal mechanisms (e.g. Amsterdam Treaty \n1997,  Habitats  Directive,  EU Common Agricultural  Policy)  have  been  set  up  to  protect  the \nEuropean environment, ensure sustainable use of its natural resources and maintain an acceptable \nlevel of biodiversity.  Protection requires monitoring and so in Europe these mechanisms have \nencouraged  the  establishment  of  a  wide  range  of,  often  unconnected  national  and  regional, \nenvironmental  monitoring activities.  Without  a common method and\/or reference point it  has \nbeen difficult to consolidate or compare the findings of such activities to build up an overview of \nthe environmental changes occurring across Europe.\nGMES  (Global  Monitoring  for  the  Environment  and  Security, \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/gmes\/index_en.htm) and INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in \n4\n7\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\n100\n8\nthe  European  Community,  http:\/\/www.ec-gis.org\/inspire\/)  are  initiatives  which  began  shortly \nafter the start of the millennium. GMES is driven jointly by the European Space Agency and the \nEuropean Commission and aims to establish a European capacity for monitoring the environment \nby  2008.  This  involves,  amongst  others,  the  consolidation  of  existing  national,  regional \nmonitoring networks and the development of benchmark datasets. INSPIRE  recently delivered \nthe European INSPIRE directive, which entered into force on 15 May 2007, laying down rules \nfor  the  establishment  of  an  infrastructure  for  spatial  information  in  Europe,  \u2018in  support  of \nenvironmental policies and policies or activities which may have a direct or indirect impact on \nthe  environment\u2019.  With  the  establishment  of  a  global  commitment  to  the  Global  Earth \nObservation System of Systems (GEOSS) in 2005, GMES and INSPIRE became part of Europe\u2019s \ncontribution to GEOSS. \nThis  paper  gives  an  overview  of  a  European  Commission  funded  GMES  project \nBIOPRESS (\u2018Linking Pan-European land cover change to pressures on Biodiversity\u2019). The initial \nfocus of BIOPRESS was to produce a standardised historical (1950\u20132000) land cover change \nproduct that would be extendable to the pan-European level and to identify and report to GMES \nthe technical,  scientific, all aspects of data accessibility,  data quality,  organisational, legal and \ninstitutional  hurdles  encountered  at  each  stage  of  the  development  and  production  process. \nBIOPRESS also tested the hypothesis  that  remotely sensed derived land cover is suitable  for \nmonitoring habitats and biodiversity. The aim of this paper is to summarize the key steps and \nmain results  related to the land cover change work.  Further publications  from the team have \npresented specific methodological developments and more detailed results (e.g. Thomson et al. \n2007). \n5\n9\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n10\n2 Background\nThe  clearest  indication  of  a  change  in  the  environment  is  when  the  land  cover  changes. \nInformation on land cover and land cover change is believed to be one of the benchmark datasets \nwhich requires  a  common approach in  recording  across  countries  because of  its  value as  an \nenvironmental change indicator (Wickham et al. 2000; Weber and Hall 2001; Pereira and Cooper \n2006). At global, continental and regional level, land cover type products have and are being \nproduced which are different in terms of their spatial cover and scale and class definition, their \ncharacteristics  being  determined  by the purpose for  which  the were created  and the adopted \nmethod. The 1 km IGBP land cover map, for example, was the first global land cover map at a \n1 km resolution which was produced using satellite  imagery (i.e.  1 km Advanced Very High \nResolution Radiometer on board the NOAA satellite series) acquired in 1992-93 (Loveland and \nBelward 1997). Its 17 cover classes are restricted in number and detail by the source data used \nand its reliability varies with cover class as this map was specifically produced to establish the \nglobal distribution of the main forest types (Loveland et al. 1999). Subsequent global land cover \nmaps,  also  derived  from satellite  imagery,  are  the  1  km Global  Land  Cover  2000 database \n(derived from 1 km SPOT Vegetation sensor data on board the ENVISAT satellite) and the 1 km \nMOD12Q1 product (derived from the 1 km Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer on \nboard the TERRA and ACQUA satellites) (Friedl et al. 2002). Realising the varying needs of \ndifferent  user  communities  MOD12Q1  represents  the  globe  in  five  different  land  cover \nclassifications, one of which is the IGBP classification, another is an 11 class Plant Functional \nType classification. The 300 m GlobCover LC v2 product (Arino et al. 2005,  GlobCover Land \nCover v2 2008 database) is currently the most recently developed global product. It is derived \nfrom time series of MERIS - ENVISAT imagery acquired from December 2004 to June 2006 and \nexploits variations in phenology to distinguish thematic cover classes that are compatible with the \n6\n11\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n12\nFAO Land Cover Classification System, also referred to as the UN Land Cover Classification \nSystem (LCCS) (Di Gregorio and Jansen 1998). \nThe first land cover map produced for Europe is the CORINE land cover map (CLC) \nwhich again was derived from satellite imagery acquired in the 1990\u2019ies (i.e. 30 m Thematic \nMapper sensor on board the Landsat satellites). But this is where similarities end. The CORINE \nland  cover  map  (CLC1990)  is  produced  through  manual  interpretation  and  has  a  minimum \nmapping  unit  of  25  ha  for  area  features  and  minimum  width  of  100  m for  linear  features \n(Heymann et al. 1993). At its highest thematic level (level 3) it shows 44 classes which describe \nland cover and use.  CORINE land cover has recently been updated using Thematic  Mapper \nimagery acquired in 2000 and a CORINE land cover 2006 is currently under production. Another \nmore recent source of land cover and use data for Europe is provided by the Lucas Survey (Land \nUse\/Cover Area frame statistical Survey) which was first carried out in 2001-03 and repeated in \n2005-07.  In contrast with the satellite based approaches listed above this survey uses a statistical \nsampling framework (i.e a two stage sampling design based on an 18 km x 18 km grid and relies \non  field  surveys  and  aerial  photography  to  determine  the  class  membership  of  grid  points \n(Gosepath et al. 2003). Even though the grid point density is relatively high, LUCAS cannot \ndeliver spatial statistics.\nLand cover change can be determined using a wide variety of approaches which can be \ngrouped into three main categories: post classification comparison, updating or backdating from a \nbase line classification and direct detection of change by combining multi-temporal source data \n(i.e. mostly airborne or satellite imagery). (Coppin et al. 2004) provide a comprehensive review, \nincluding  technical  advantages  and  disadvantages,  of  the  post  classification  comparison  and \ndirect change detection approaches that have been developed to date. Both types of approaches \n7\n13\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\n173\n174\n14\ngenerally are based on automated image processing and classification techniques. Backdating or \nupdating from a baseline classification is very much associated with manual interpretation of \naerial or satellite imagery. The main issue with post classification comparison is that the accuracy \nof the change detection will be at best as good as the combined accuracy of the two independent \nclassifications (Coppin et al. 2004), while, backdating and updating are affected by the accuracy \nof  the  baseline  classification.  The  direct  detection  methods  are  designed  to  circumvent  this \nproblem, but rely more heavily on consistency (with respect to for example timing of acquisition, \nquality, sensor type) in the source data.  Although the general consensus is that reliable change \ndetection requires consistency in the used source data and classification system between time \npoints,  one small  advantage of post  classification comparison is that,  if  the independent  land \ncover products are based on different classification systems it still is possible to derive change \nstatistics provided that the classification systems are thematically linked (i.e. harmonised, (Wyatt \nand  Gerard  2001).  (Comber et  al. 2004;  Fisher et  al. 2006)  advocate  a  fuzzy,  probabilistic \napproach,  whilst  (Lepers et  al. 2005)  who  were  synthesising  global  land  cover  change \ninformation  and  were  dealing  with  49  different  data  sets,  would  adopt  the  definitions  of  a \nparticular data set which would vary with the type of change that was under scrutiny. The other \napproaches inherently assume the use of the same classification system at each time point. In this \ncase, the initial choice or design of a classification system (land cover and or use) is crucial as \nthere  is  no such thing as  a standardised  land cover  classification  system that  will  satisfy all \npossible  national,  European or global  stakeholders  concerned with environmental  monitoring. \nThe FAO land cover  classification  system based on a  system of attributes  (Di  Gregorio and \nJansen 1998) is one of the best attempts to date to provide a common but still flexible system. \nBoth IGBP and CORINE land cover are some of the few global\/continental land cover \nproducts  which  can  provide  change statistics  for  a  ten  year  period.  CLC2000 was produced \n8\n15\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\n16\nthrough  the  manual  updating  of  CLC1990.  In  this  case  the  updating  was  also  seen  as  an \nopportunity to correct for errors observed in the 1990 layer (Perdigao and Annoni 1997). As a \nresult CORINE updating produced simultaneously a CLC2000 layer, a corrected CLC1990 layer, \nand change detection statistics observed over a 10 year period. Table 1 below gives the change \nstatistics calculated for CLC thematic level 1, the lowest thematic level. The table shows that \n\u2018Agricultural  Areas\u2019 underwent the biggest changes: ~814 thousand ha (i.e. 0.2 % of the 359 \nmillion ha with CORINE coverage) was lost to \u2018Artificial Surfaces\u2019 and while in some areas of \nEurope  ~  406 thousand ha  was  converted  to  \u2018Forest  and  semi  natural  areas\u2019,  in  other  areas \n~ 368 thousand ha of \u2018Agricultural Areas\u2019 were reclaimed from \u2018Forest and semi natural areas\u2019.\nInsert Table 1\nWith respect to Europe, there have been three additional instances where change detection \nwas carried out for a period longer then ten years. Two of these activities focused on obtaining \nchange information for certain key areas of Europe: the European coastline (i.e 1970-1990, the \nLACOAST project, (Perdigao and Christensen 2000)) and the peri-urban zone of 25 large cities \n(i.e.1950-1990, the MURBANDY\/MOLAND project, (Lavalle et al. 2001; Lavalle et al. 2002) \nand were both based on the manual backdating of CLC1990 using MSS (Multi-Spectral Scanner \non board the early Landsat satellites) and aerial photography respectively. The LACOAST results \nshowed an urban gain along most parts of the European Coastline mainly at the cost of \nagricultural and forested areas (Figure 1).  MURBANDY\/MOLAND found a general increase in \nurban sprawl ranging from 25 % (Ruhrgebiet, Germany) to 270 % (Algarve, Portugal) of the \noriginal urban area recorded in the 1950s with an average of 117 % (Table 2). The average loss of \nnatural and agricultural land to urban sprawl was 22.0 % with Iraklion, Greece loosing the most \n(41.3 %) and Dresden, Germany the least (7.3 %). The third instance carried out manual \n9\n17\n200\n201\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n207\n208\n209\n210\n211\n212\n213\n214\n215\n216\n217\n218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\n18\nbackdating of CLC1990 with 1970s MSS imagery for four neighbouring Eastern European \nCountries, namely, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary (Feranec et al. 2000). The \nwork highlighted national variations, where, although deforestation was the most important \nchange for Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, the net amount of forest lost would vary from \n52.5 %, to 25.9 % and 10.1 % respectively. Both Romania and Slovakia witnessed substantial \nlosses and gains of intensively cultivated land, respectively 26.2 % and 23.5 % loss and 21.6 % \nand 34.3 % gain. This also occurred in Hungary and the Czech Republic, but to a lesser extend. \nInsert Figure 1\nInsert Table 2\nBIOPRESS\u2019s focus was to determine how past changes in land cover from 1950 to 2000 \nmay have impacted on habitats and their associated biodiversity.  Similarly to LACOAST and \nMURBANDY\/MOLAND a manual backdating approach was adopted, but the aim of BIOPRESS \nwas to capture overall patterns of change that had occurred in the main bio-geographical zones of \nEurope, with a focus on protected areas, and to develop ways of converting this information into \nmeasures of impact on biodiversity. Aerial photography was chosen as this was the only type of \ndata that remained consistent from the 1950s to the present.\n3 Methodology\nThe applied  method was designed to  produce land cover  change information  collected  in  an \noperational  and  consistent  manner  from  samples  which  are  representative  of  the  main  bio-\ngeographical  regions  of  Europe  and including  areas  of  importance  for  European biodiversity \n(NATURA 2000 sites - European (Commission 2003). Land cover is classified according to the \n10\n19\n225\n226\n227\n228\n229\n230\n231\n232\n233\n234\n235\n236\n237\n238\n239\n240\n241\n242\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n20\nCORINE Land Cover nomenclature with 44 classes at the highest level 3 (Heymann et al. 1993). \nChange was captured by means of \u2018backdating\u2019 where the older dataset is compared against the \nmost recent. There were two approaches with different scale of interpretation: \n\u2022 For regions (\u2018windows\u2019) of circa 30 km x 30 km in size, aerial photographs of the 1950s \nwere compared against CLC90. A minimum mapping unit of 25 ha was used which is in \nline with the standard CORINE Land Cover minimum mapping unit.\n\u2022 For transects  of  2  km x 15 km,  aerial  photography from 1950,  1990 and 2000 were \ninterpreted at a more spatially detailed minimum mapping unit of 0.5 ha.\nThe whole process involved 5 key steps: \n\u2022 the selection of NATURA 2000 sites to position the windows and transects, \n\u2022 the search, acquisition and pre-processing of aerial photographs, \n\u2022 the manual interpretation of the photographs \n\u2022 the assessment of the quality of the interpretation and \n\u2022 the  storage  of  interpretation  results  and  its  associated  data  and  metadata  in  a  central \ndatabase.\n3.1 Sampling of sites \nTo ensure that the results of the analysis of land cover change could be interpreted in the wider \nEuropean  context,  windows  and  transects  that  are  truly  representative  of  the  diversity  of \nEuropean biogeography would have to be selected.  However,  the diversity in land cover and \nrelated local landscape features across Europe is very high and not randomly distributed so that a \nrepresentative  sample  would  need  to  be  stratified  and large  in  size.  Several  external  factors \nconstrained the sampling strategy.  Budgetary constraints required an approach which aimed at \n11\n21\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n255\n256\n257\n258\n259\n260\n261\n262\n263\n264\n265\n266\n267\n268\n269\n270\n271\n272\n273\n274\n22\nensuring the highest benefit from a limited (i.e. affordable) number of sample sites. Stakeholders \nwere expecting the data  not only to describe general  patterns of change across the European \ncountryside, but also to provide comparisons between changes inside and outside protected nature \nreserves (i.e. NATURA 2000 sites). As a result the NATURA 2000 network became the starting \npoint from which the windows and transect sites were selected. The Biogeographical Regions \nMap of Europe (BRME) (http:\/\/www.eea.europa.eu) was used for stratification providing close \nlinkage to the Habitats Directive, Birds Directive, Emerald Network and NATURA 2000.\nDirect  access  to  the  NATURA  2000  database  which  contains  location  and  habitat \ndescription of all NATURA 2000 sites in Europe proved impossible because of restrictions on \naccess to this source. So, a super-set of 229 NATURA 2000 sites of European importance were \nidentified  by  an  external  expert  (Pierre  Devillers  of  the  Royal  Belgian  Institute  of  Natural \nSciences) with access to the database. Pierre Devillers used a combination of information within \nthe NATURA 2000 database and his expertise to select representative and important sites across \nEurope.\nNext,  a selection from the super-set  of 229 sites was made,  aimed at  (i)  generating a \nBRME area-weighted sample of 100 windows and (ii) representing as many of the 4 EUNIS \nAnnex-I  habitats  (http:\/\/eunis.eea.europa.eu\/introduction.jsp)  that  were  identified  by  the \nstakeholders,  as  possible  (i.e.  \u2018Freshwater  habitats\u2019,  \u2018Natural  and  semi-natural  grassland \nformations\u2019,  \u2018Raised  bogs  and  mires  and  fens\u2019  and  \u2018Forests\u2019).  In  cases  of  equal  number  of \nhabitats present per BRME region, window selection was done randomly. In parallel the partners \nset out to select between eight and ten transects per partner country (UK, Finland, Belgium, The \nNetherlands, Germany, Spain, and Slovakia) according to the following rules:\n12\n23\n275\n276\n277\n278\n279\n280\n281\n282\n283\n284\n285\n286\n287\n288\n289\n290\n291\n292\n293\n294\n295\n296\n297\n298\n24\n\u2022 Each transect is located inside a super-set  window site and contains at  least part of a \nNATURA 2000 site.\n\u2022 Select two representative transects for each of the four pre-defined Annex-I habitat types.\n\u2022 For additional transects, nationally important NATURA 2000 sites should be considered.\n\u2022 Transects should represent a gradient of pressures on land cover starting from the edge of \na NATURA 2000 site and bearing towards an intensively used area.\n3.2 Aerial photography\nThe search criteria for the aerial photography were:\n\u2022 Photo cover for the windows must include the NATURA 2000 centre point. \n\u2022 The location of the windows can be shifted and\/or rotated provided that the NATURA \n2000 centre  point  is  at  least  5 km from the edge of the photo cover.  The location of \ntransects can be shifted as long as selection criteria (see above) are not compromised.\n\u2022 The photographic coverage is at least 75 % of the window. Cloud coverage is less then \n10 % and imagery is snow free.\n\u2022 The  timeframe  for  windows  is  between  1943  and  1959  and  for  transects  between \n1943-1959, 1988-1992 and 1998-2002. \n\u2022 The scale of the photographs is between 1:25000 and 1:60000 and between 1:10000 and \n1:25000 for windows and transects respectively.\nIt was clear from the beginning that these preset criteria combined with external factors \nsuch as data availability,  accessibility and cost would affect the final number of windows and \ntransects. Also depending on the source of the photos, pre-processing was expected to involve \n13\n25\n299\n300\n301\n302\n303\n304\n305\n306\n307\n308\n309\n310\n311\n312\n313\n314\n315\n316\n317\n318\n319\n320\n321\n322\n26\nany number of the following steps: (1) scanning of hard copy, (2) introducing fiducial marks, (3) \northo-rectification, and mosaicking. \n3.3 Manual photo interpretation\nThe problem with most European data sets is that they are inconsistent across regions and\/or \ncountries. In this project one of the main steps taken to achieve consistency was the design of two \nmanuals for photo interpretation (Feranec et al. 2004; Feranec et al. 2004b): one clarifying the \nCLC level 3 class definition with respect to 1:25 000 a 1:60 000 scale panchromatic aerial photos \n(minimum  mapping  unit  of  25  ha)  and  providing  rules  for  backdating  CLC90  with  photos \n(windows), another describing the CLC level 3 classes with respect to 1:10 000 a 1:25 000 scale \nphotos (minimum mapping unit of 0.5 ha) and providing rules for change detection from photo\u2013\nto\u2013photo interpretation (transects). The other steps taken to ensure consistency were training of \nthe interpreters and quality assessment.\nThe interpretation approach adopted for the windows was to overlay the CLC90 polygons \non mosaics of 1950s photos and to focus on identifying change.  The original  1990s Landsat \nscenes from which CLC90 is derived were, where available,  used to distinguish real  changes \nfrom changes due to errors in the CLC90 database. Only the changes believed to be real were \nrecorded. The resulting output was a CLC50 to CLC90 change matrix for each window. The \napproach adopted for the transects was to interpret the most recent aerial photographs first and \nthen backdate (Figure 2). The first interpretation has polygons labeled with the land cover of \n2000 (CLC00). In the second interpretation, using the aerial photos of 1990 (CLC90), only new \nlines are added. The newly created polygons receive a label with the land cover of 1990 and also \n2000. For polygons that did not change, the attributes of CLC00 are copied to CLC90. When the \n14\n27\n323\n324\n325\n326\n327\n328\n329\n330\n331\n332\n333\n334\n335\n336\n337\n338\n339\n340\n341\n342\n343\n344\n345\n346\n347\n28\ninterpretation of 1990 is finished the same procedure can be followed for 1950 (CLC50). This \nensures that the interpreter only adds lines and creates polygons if the land cover has changed. \nThe results are polygons with multiple attributes which were used to produce change statistics. \nInsert Figure 2\n3.4 Quality Assessment\nQuality assessment provides a measure of accuracy of the interpretations. The general principle \nof  any  quality  assessment  (QA)  procedure  consists  of  comparing  the  obtained  results  with \nindependent data. However, especially for the 1950s, no comparable independent dataset exists, \nso  the  QA procedures  that  were  developed  aimed  at  establishing  a  measure  of  consistency \nbetween  interpreters.  For  the  windows,  an  independent  expert  (controller)  would  reinterpret \nsampled areas (5 km x 5 km verification units) that were identified within a selection of windows \nby placing a square grid 5 km x 5 km over the window area and looking for 5 km x 5 km areas \nwhich include the most  commonly occurring types  of land cover changes of the country the \nwindow represented  or  where  strange  and unexpected  types  of  changes  were  observed.  The \nwindows selected were those which showed the highest rate of change within one country. In \ntotal  circa 7 % of the total  area interpreted was verified.  The consistency R (%) for a given \nwindow was calculated as: R= A\/N*100 where A is the number of identical changes (i.e. in both \nsize and type) and N is the number of all changes in given window identified by controller and \ninterpreter.  A  window  is  rejected  and  returned  to  the  interpreter  for  improvement  when  its \nconsistency rate is below 85 %.\n15\n29\n348\n349\n350\n351\n352\n353\n354\n355\n356\n357\n358\n359\n360\n361\n362\n363\n364\n365\n366\n367\n368\n369\n370\n371\n30\nFor  the  transects,  a  more  extensive  approach  was  adopted  aimed  at  evaluating  the \nthematic, geometric and change detection aspects of the interpretation. Here 18 transects were \nreinterpreted six times using a point grid sample, each time by a different independent controller \nand five transects were reinterpreted fully by one independent controller. Only the results based \non the point reinterpretation that assess the consistency in class identification (i.e. thematic) and \nchange detection are included in this paper.  The thematic consistency between controller  and \ninterpreter was calculated by means of confusion matrices (Provost and Kohavi 1998). Cover \nclass consistency cp\u02c6 and overall thematic consistency p\u02c6 were calculated as follows:\n6*\n a\u02c6 c\nc\nc n\np =\nwhere ac is the number of grid point observation identified as class C on both occasions (by one \nof six controllers and interpreter), and nc is the total number of grid points identified as class C by \nthe interpreter. As one interpretation is controlled independently by six observers, it has to be \nweighted by the number of observers. \nand                                                         6*\na\u02c6\nn\np =\nwhere a is the number of grid point observations that identified the same class on both occasions \n(by one of six controllers and interpreter), and n is the total number of grid points. \nThe  consistency in  detecting  change was  done  by comparing  the  land  cover  changes \nstatistics  calculated  from the interpretation of the local  interpreter  and the controllers  for the \nperiods between 1950-2000, 1950-1990 and 1990-2000.\n4 Results\n4.1 Window and transect sites\n16\n31\n372\n373\n374\n375\n376\n377\n378\n379\n380\n381\n382\n383\n384\n385\n386\n387\n388\n389\n390\n391\n392\n393\n394\n32\nAerial photos of the 1950s were obtained, processed and interpreted for 73 window sites and 59 \ntransect sites. The 73 windows are distributed across 17 countries, 36 are located in the eight \npartner countries and 37 outside partner countries (Figure 3 and Table 3). The total interpreted \nwindow area is 59297 km2 and the total  interpreted transect area is 1807 km2.  While for the \ntransect sites full area coverage was achieved in most cases (i.e. 30 km2 per transect) the resulting \narea interpreted per window site depended on the available photo-coverage and CLC90 coverage \n(Figure 4). 36 of the 73 windows achieved more then 750 km2 coverage. The lowest coverages \nachieved were for windows in Hungary and Romania. The exceptionally large average size of \nwindows in Poland is caused by the merging of two partially overlapping windows into one.\nInsert Figure 3, Table 3 and Figure 4\nFigure 5 compares the relative area distribution per BRME zone, with the relative area \ndistribution achieved by transect and window sites and the relative number distribution of the \noriginal 229 super-set sites. Note that there are no transects within the Pannonian zone, although \nthere  are  windows. In general,  the Alpine and Atlantic  zones  are  over-sampled,  whereas  the \nBoreal  zone is  under sampled.  Note also that  the expert  was biased in his  selection towards \nNATURA 2000 sites located in the Mediterranean and the Pannonian zones. \nInsert Figure 5\nThe  variability  of  the  BRME zones  and  the  window  and  transects  sites  in  terms  of \nCORINE land cover class proportions was investigated in detail to assess the use of the BRME as \na spatial framework for extrapolating the land cover and land cover change data measured from \nthe  sites.   Figure  6  shows  that  the  sample  size  is  too  small  to  differentiate  between  the \nbiogeographical regions due to the large variability in land cover distributions within the regions \n17\n33\n395\n396\n397\n398\n399\n400\n401\n402\n403\n404\n405\n406\n407\n408\n409\n410\n411\n412\n413\n414\n415\n416\n417\n418\n419\n34\nand the sites. The use of the NATURA 2000 network as the focus for the sampling has also \ninfluenced the results returned by the windows and transects as both are biased toward semi-\nnatural conditions. As a result both the window and transect sites are less representative of the \nBRME zones as a whole than a random stratified sample would be.\nInsert Figure 6\nAlthough the BRME was considered to be the most suitable stratification for BIOPRESS \ngiven its wide user support and the small number of zones, the overall conclusion of the analysis \nwas that the nature of the BRME and BIOPRESS sampling scheme were not appropriate for \nextrapolation of land cover change results across Europe with any reasonable level of confidence. \nThe  real  issue  is  the  number  of  samples  and  their  distribution.  The  window areas  probably \nrepresent  no more  than  1.5 % of  Europe  which  is  inadequate  for  a  region  with  such varied \nlandscapes molded by nature and humans. At a workshop (Jongman, personal communication) a \nteam of experts estimated that approximately 5250 sites of 1 km2 in size distributed in a stratified \nrandom  manner  using  the  much  more  detailed  350  class  European  landscape  database  for \nstratification  (i.e.  LANMAP2  (Jongman et  al. 2006)  would  provide  a  statistically  reliable \nestimate of all European habitats (i.e 15 sites of 1 km2 per stratum). If the aim is to compare the \nsituation inside and outside protected nature reserves an additional sample set representative of \nthe nature reserves would have to be added. \n4.2 Quality of interpretation\nA total of 204 verification units were assessed located in 43 of the 73 windows. The average \nacceptable consistency rate achieved was 94 %. Table 4 gives the overall thematic consistency \ncalculated for the three time points and the three CLC classification levels, using the results from \n18\n35\n420\n421\n422\n423\n424\n425\n426\n427\n428\n429\n430\n431\n432\n433\n434\n435\n436\n437\n438\n439\n440\n441\n442\n443\n444\n36\nall grid points of all transects. As the resulting number of grid points differed between individual \ntransect,  a  transect  specific  weighting was assigned to  each point.  The weighting  factor  was \ndefined as the total transect area, divided by the number of validation points. The time point was \nfound to have no influence on thematic consistency. Increasing thematic detail at the other hand \nhas a high impact, causing a reduction in interpreter\u2019s consistency from 91 % at level 1 to ~ 54 % \nat level 3.\nInsert Table 4\nAt individual transect level, the thematic consistency shows the same trends as observed \nfor the overall thematic consistency.  However, due to the specific landscape characteristics of \nsome of the sites we found in some cases that interpretations at CLC level 1 and 2 achieved \nsimilar levels of consistency which were very different from the consistency achieved at level 3, \nwhilst other transects show similar consistency at level 2 and 3 (e.g. Table 5). Table 6 shows the \noverall consistency in detecting change at CLC level 3. In 77 % of the cases the local interpreter \nand the controllers agree on the changes. In 14 % of the cases the controller found changes that \nwere  not  detected  by  the  local  interpreter  and  9  % of  changes  are  identified  by  the  local \ninterpreter but not by the controller. \nOverall,  the  interpretation  team  managed  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  interpretation \nconsistency. This means that the team\u2019s interpretation of cover classes and their changes were \nfound to be either consistently correct or incorrect. At CLC levels 1 and 2 consistency is very \nhigh (~91 % and ~81 % respectively). At CLC level 3 only ~ 54 % of the time the interpreters \nagree on the cover class. The QA enabled us to identify which classes at what thematic level \nwhere prone to confusion. For example, the importance of the conversion between arable field \nand  grassland  is  expected  to  be  inflated  as  the  quality  assessment  highlighted  a  consistent \n19\n37\n445\n446\n447\n448\n449\n450\n451\n452\n453\n454\n455\n456\n457\n458\n459\n460\n461\n462\n463\n464\n465\n466\n467\n468\n469\n38\nconfusion  between grassland and  arable  fields.  The  main  causes  for  confusion  for  both,  the \nwindow and  transect  interpretations,  were  ambiguous  CLC class  definitions,  and  the  similar \nappearance of CLC classes on panchromatic aerial photography. An error propagation analysis \n(not shown here) based on the QA results also enabled us to establish that aerial photo quality \nwas another main factor introducing confusion. What we were not able to establish, due to lack of \nindependent reference data, is how often and in which cases interpreters agreed wrongly. \nInsert Table 5 & Table 6\n4.3 Observed land cover and land cover changes\nAlthough the size and location of the samples did not allow for an extrapolation across Europe to \nproduce a European map of change, the data collected still  produced some interesting results. \nTable  7 shows that the European landscape is  mainly a mixture of agricultural  land (~ 30 % \n+ ~ 10 % pastures), forests (~ 35 % + ~ 11 % semi-natural areas) with an increasing amount of \nurban fabric (~ 7 %).  Figures from the \u2018DOBRIS assessment\u2019  which were estimated from an \naggregated  (to  a  250  m  grid)  and  generalized  CORINE  land  cover  1990,  suggest  a  higher \nproportion of land covered by arable  land and a smaller  proportion covered by urban fabric: \nforest cover 33 %, arable land 24 %, extensive agriculture and mixed land use 24 %, permanent \ncrops 15 %, permanent grassland 2 % and urban areas 1 % (Stanners and Bordeau 1995). The \nagricultural areas have seen a decrease in areas of complex cultivation, whilst forested areas show \nan increase for all forest types (broadleaved, conifer and mixed forests) and a slight decrease in \ntransitional woodland and shrub (Figure 7). \nInsert Table 7, Figure 7, Figure 8\n20\n39\n470\n471\n472\n473\n474\n475\n476\n477\n478\n479\n480\n481\n482\n483\n484\n485\n486\n487\n488\n489\n490\n491\n492\n493\n40\nThe total  extent of land cover changes that have occurred within all windows account \nonly to an average of 10 % of the total  measured  area (the average is  taken from the three \nthematic interpretation levels). In other words, 90 % of the measured window areas have shown \nno change of land cover at all. Increasing the spatial resolution from 25 ha minimum mapping \n(windows) unit to 0.5 ha minimum mapping unit (transects) invariably led to an average of 2.8 \ntimes more area being identified as having changed. This increase represented on average 7 % or \n25 % of the total area when interpreted at level 1 (five cover classes: Artificial areas, Agricultural \nareas,  Forests  and  semi-natural  areas,  Wetlands,  Water  bodies)  or  level  3  (44 cover  classes) \nrespectively. An increase in thematic detail, from 5 cover classes in level 1, to 44 classes in level \n3,  not  only caused an increase  in the  amount  of change detected  but  also altered  the trends \nobserved in the annual rate of change (Figure 8). Where at level 1 the transect data is suggesting a \nslow down in the most recent ten years, at level 3 changes in the last ten years are more evident in \nparticular for Belgium, Germany and UK. The aggregated level 1 does not provide evidence of \nchanges happening at a finer thematic level as shown from the analysis done at level 2 and 3. \nThis suggests that many of the changes have occurred within the more general landscape level 1 \ncategories of build up, agricultural land and forest\/semi-natural land.  \nThe dynamics of the changes can be better  understood when analysing the land cover \nflows for the windows and transects. With a classification system of 15 (level 2) or 44 classes \n(level 3) theoretically 210 or 1892 different types of land cover change are possible. Figure 9 \nshow the largest cover flows observed in level 2 and level 3 from the windows (\u2265 10000 ha or 0.2 \n% of total interpreted area for 1950-1990) and transects (\u2265 1300 ha or 0.7 % of total interpreted \narea for 1950-1990; \u2265 300 ha or 0.2 % of total interpreted area for 1990-2000) in terms of total \narea changed. The most important land cover conversions were found to be the following:\n21\n41\n494\n495\n496\n497\n498\n499\n500\n501\n502\n503\n504\n505\n506\n507\n508\n509\n510\n511\n512\n513\n514\n515\n516\n517\n42\n\u2022 From heterogeneous agricultural areas (24 or 242, 243) to urban fabric (11 or 112), to \narable land (21 or 211) and to forest (31 or 311, 312).\n\u2022 From arable land (21 or 211) and pastures (23 or 231) to urban fabric (11 or 112) or \nindustrial, commercial, and transport units (12). \n\u2022 From  shrub  and\/or  herbaceous  vegetation  association  (32  or  324)  to  forests  (31  or \n311,312,313),  and  its  inverse  conversion,  i.e.  from forest  to  shrub and\/or  herbaceous \nvegetation association. \nThe increased spatial detail of the transects highlighted two additional conversion types: \n\u2022 From pastures (231) to shrub and\/or herbaceous vegetation association (324).\n\u2022 From arable (211) land to pastures (231) and its inverse conversion.\nThe importance of the latter  conversion highlighted may have been inflated by the consistent \ndifficulty  in  differentiating  grassland  from  arable  field  on  panchromatic  photography,  even \nthough rotation  between arable  crops  and grasslands  is  common practice  in  many European \ncountries. From the flows it is not clear how many of the inverse conversions observed relate to \nopposite changes which are occurring in different places or to areas which have been converted \nback to their 1950s state. Figure 10 shows the proportion of the interpreted transect area that \nunderwent  change twice subdivided into the proportion that  has reversed back to its  original \n1950s state (i.e. inverse conversion) and the proportion that changed into a different state twice \n(i.e. forward conversion).  At thematic level 2, Finland and Slovakia showed both, the largest \nproportion of interpreted area that underwent change twice and the largest  proportion of area \nshowing an inverse conversion. Interestingly at thematic level 3 the overall area proportions have \nincreased substantially for all countries except Finland, but more striking, for Finland the area \nproportion  undergoing  forward  and  inverse  conversion  is  reversed.  Further  investigation  and \ncomparison  of  the  Finland  and  Slovakia  cases  show different  patterns  of  change  which  are \ndependent on the history and economy of the region. For Finland, where forest management is a \n22\n43\n518\n519\n520\n521\n522\n523\n524\n525\n526\n527\n528\n529\n530\n531\n532\n533\n534\n535\n536\n537\n538\n539\n540\n541\n542\n44\nkey part of its economy, the inverse conversions at level 2 and the forward conversions at level 3 \nrepresent in most instances the same changes which are associated to a forest type \u2018A\u2019 (e.g. 313) \n\u2013 non-forest (324) \u2013 forest type \u2018B\u2019 (e.g. 312) conversion. Slovakia, at the other hand, shows a \nlarge  proportion  of  inverse  conversions  at  both  thematic  levels  2  and  3.  Here,  previously \ncollectivized and intensified arable land has, since 1990, slowly been reclaimed, abandoned or \nrestituted to co-operatives (Kuemmerle et al. 2006), which could explain the proportions of land \n(28 % and 4 % of land that underwent change twice \u2013 Figure 11) showing an inverse conversion \nfrom 242, \u2018complex cultivation\u2019 to 211, \u2018non-irrigated arable land\u2019 and back and 231, \u2018pastures\u2019 \nto 242 \u2018complex cultivation\u2019 and back. Forest management is likely to be the main explanation \nfor the transitions from 231 and 324, \u2018transitional woodland shrub\u2019 to 31*, \u2018forest\u2019 and back. \nInsert Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11\nTo determine  whether  characteristic  regional  patterns  of  change could be observed at \nEuropean level, the 1892 different types of possible land cover change (CLC level 3), observed \nfor the period 1950-1990, were translated into six specific environmental processes using a land \ncover flow to pressures conversion matrix: \n1. Agricultural  Intensification:  includes  agricultural  conversions  as  well  as  cases  in  which \nhuman-altered  areas  become  transformed  into  a  more  intensive  practice  by changing  the \nnatural cover.\n2. Land Abandonment: includes the cropping cessation and conversion into early successional, \nherbaceous habitats. The transition to woody, later-successional habitats has been considered \nas a Mediterranean extension of afforestation.\n3. Afforestation: includes the conversion of open (more or less natural) habitats into forests or \nmacchias.\n23\n45\n543\n544\n545\n546\n547\n548\n549\n550\n551\n552\n553\n554\n555\n556\n557\n558\n559\n560\n561\n562\n563\n564\n565\n566\n46\n4. Deforestation: we have distinguished deforestation from afforestation instead of considering \nthe first as a relaxation of the second. Both are in fact affecting biodiversity in different ways.\n5. Drainage:  in  a  broad  sense,  includes  all  changes  affecting  aquatic  habitats  that  are \ntransformed into more terrestrial ones: disappearance of wetlands, but also changes in rivers \nand  in  estuarine  areas.  We have  included  land  gain  from intertidal  and  sea  areas  in  the \nNetherlands, as well as the lost of peatlands drained due to agricultural practices or replaced \nby forests in Finland.\n6. Urbanisation: includes the transformation to urban covers but also to related covers (road \nsystem, leisure areas, construction sites, etc.)\nVariations  in  terms  of  these  pressures  (expressed  as  % window area)  at  play  in  the \nwindows were assessed by means of a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA, CANOCO 4.5). \nIn addition to individual  windows, the BRME regions (as the barycentre  of sets  of windows \nlocated within each region) and the six pressures (as barycentre of individual window scores) \nwere projected on the ordination plan. The first ordination plan shown on figure 12 explains 50 % \nof the variation in the proportion of land cover change accounted for by the six pressures. The \nfirst axis separates landscapes mainly affected by afforestation and deforestation, two pressures \nlocated close together on the plan; those are mainly found in Boreal and Alpine regions, two \nareas which are dominated by forest management activities. The second axis singles out changes \nassociated with agricultural activities, mainly abandonment and intensification which are located \nclose together on the plan and are mainly encountered in the Mediterranean region, suggesting \nthat in this region, the two processes occurred simultaneously but not necessarily in the same \nplace. The same pattern was found to have occurred in Romania (Feranec et al. 2000) which in \nBIOPRESS is classified as Continental or Alpine. Finally, urbanisation and drainage are shown \nto be more characteristic of the Continental and Atlantic regions.\n24\n47\n567\n568\n569\n570\n571\n572\n573\n574\n575\n576\n577\n578\n579\n580\n581\n582\n583\n584\n585\n586\n587\n588\n589\n590\n591\n48\nInsert Figure 12, Table 8\n5 Discussion \nBecause of the sampling size and a bias towards areas containing nature reserves, it  was not \npossible to produce statistical reliable estimates of land cover change for the six BRME regions \nof  Europe  based  on  the  BIOPRESS sites.  BIOPRESS was a  demonstration  project  testing  a \nmethodology  that  could  be  applied  to  monitoring  habitats  and  their  biodiversity  from  pan-\nEuropean land cover change on an operational basis if adequate sampling was provided. In this \ncontext, the project produced some interesting results. The degree of thematic detail and level of \nspatial  detail  of the land cover measured will  determine the type,  amount and rate of change \ndetected. It will also to a certain extent determine the reliability of the results, although other \nfactors such as clarity of definition and the quality of the source data will also play a role. The \noriginal choice of nomenclature used to define the land cover, the characteristics of the imaging \nsystem and the capability of this system to distinguish the classes defined by the nomenclature is \nimportant. For long term land cover change detection, consistency in methodology is key, so the \nsolution is either to have a nomenclature designed independent of the imaging system used or to \nrely on the long term availability of similar and affordable imagery (with respect to spatial and \nspectral resolution) (Duhamel 1998). \nBIOPRESS, LACOAST and MOLAND\/MURBANDY agree that Europe has witnessed \nan  increase  in  urban  sprawl,  mainly  in  the  form  of  discontinuous  buildup.  Interestingly \nBIOPRESS  found  that  this  is  mainly  at  the  cost  of  arable  land  (211,  231  or  242)  whilst \nLACOAST also highlights losses of forest to urban and MURBANDY losses of natural areas to \nurban. Bearing in mind that all three findings are based on biased samples \u2013 LACOAST having \n25\n49\n592\n593\n594\n595\n596\n597\n598\n599\n600\n601\n602\n603\n604\n605\n606\n607\n608\n609\n610\n611\n612\n613\n614\n615\n616\n50\nfocused on a 10 km coastline buffer coastline, MOLAND\/MURBANDY on large urban centers \nand  BIOPRESS  on  areas  near  or  surrounding  nature  reserves  -  the  results  suggest  that \nurbanisation is widespread across Europe but that the losers to urban sprawl will depend on the \nlocal context.\nThe BIOPRESS results show different types of changes dominating different regions in \nEurope.  These  are  likely  to  have  been  the  result  of  different  social,  political  and  economic \nprocesses. One particular  example was highlighted in this paper, showing hints picked up by \nBIOPRESS from the observed differences between Finland and Slovakia. Other more localized \nand detailed studies clearly demonstrate the importance of these processes at national and local \nlevel and their impact on the evolution of the local landscape. For example, (Kuemmerle et al. \n2006) found distinct differences in the economic and political processes and subsequent changes \nthat occurred following the breakdown of the Soviet Union between three neighbouring Eastern \nEuropean countries. (Mottet et al. 2006) who studied the land use history of eight farms in the \nFrench Pyrenees  confirmed  \u2018remoteness\u2019  to  be an important  generic  cause  of  land cover\/use \nchange in the European mountain areas but also detected local specific dynamics. A stratification \nof the European landscape should therefore, where relevant, take into consideration local social, \neconomic and political backgrounds (Jongman et al. 2006). \nThe  methods  implemented  by  BIOPRESS  (and  LACOAST  and  MOLAND\/ \nMURBANDY) are only able to determine conversions from one cover type into another. Land \ncover modifications, where \u2018more subtle changes affect the character of the land cover without \nchanging the cover itself\u2019, are generally more common than land cover conversions (Copin and \nLambin 2004) and often have a significant negative or positive impact on habitat  quality and \nbiodiversity.  A  good  example  of  land  cover  modification  is  the  case  of  agricultural \n26\n51\n617\n618\n619\n620\n621\n622\n623\n624\n625\n626\n627\n628\n629\n630\n631\n632\n633\n634\n635\n636\n637\n638\n639\n640\n641\n52\nintensification.  The \u2018agricultural  intensification\u2019 detected by BIOPRESS does not include,  the \nsubtle changes in, for example, ploughing frequency and fertilizer and pesticide use. Since the \nultimate aim of BIOPRESS was to assess how changes in the land cover had impacted on the \nhabitats  and  their  biodiversity,  the  original  idea  was  to  capture  some  of  the  subtle  changes \nthrough the integration of social and economic indicators with the land cover change matrices. \nHowever we soon found out that (i) there was very little of such data available for the 1950s, (ii) \nthe more recent data found for Europe varied significantly in spatial and temporal coverage, scale \nand semantics  and (iii)  many datasets  came with a price tag.  Another  GMES funded project \nEUROSION which required a wide variety of coastal related data experienced similar stumbling \nblocks (EUROSION 2003). Still,  BIOPRESS, in its second phase, was required to assess the \nimpact of land cover change on habitats and their biodiversity. Land cover type products derived \nfrom remote sensing are often listed as a \u2018biodiversity\u2019 or \u2018environmental\u2019 indicator suitable for \ndetermining trends in  habitats  and landscape level  biodiversity.  BIOPRESS demonstrated,  by \nincorporating the land cover change data into biodiversity impact tables (methods and results not \nshown  in  this  paper)  that,  although  data  such  as  the  CLC  product  can  provide  valuable \ninformation  with  potential  for  improvement,  there  are  clear  limitations  associated  to  this \napproach. \n \n6 Acknowledgements\nThe presented work was carried out in the framework of the BIOPRESS project \u2018Linking Pan-\nEuropean Land Cover Change to Pressures on Biodiversity\u2019 which was partially funded by the \nEuropean  Commission  DG  Research  under  the  \u2018Energy,  Environment  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment\u2019 programme of the Fifth Framework.

An analysis routine was established to randomly sample a set of 75 (30km x 30km) \ngrid cells which were then used as the population to derive mean CORINE land cover proportions \n(Agriculture, Forest and Semi-Natural) for each BRME zone of Europe. This routine was \nrepeated 1000 times for each BRME zone to represent the possible range of results that could \nhave been derived if different sets of windows or transects had been selected. The 1000 mean \nproportion results for each BIOPRESS land cover aggregation were sorted and the 50th and \n950th were extracted as estimates of the variability within the BRME zone. The figure shows the \nmean cover proportions and variability of (a) Agricultural classes against Forest classes and (b) \nAgricultural classes against Semi-natural classes. \n35\n69\n803\n804\n805\n806\n807\n808\n809\n810\n811\n812\n813\n814\n815\n816\n817\n818\n819\n820\n821\n822\n70\nTransects\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n1.1.2.
