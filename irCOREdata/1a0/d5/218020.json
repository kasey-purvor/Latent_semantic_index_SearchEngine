However, substantial variation exists in the compliance behaviour of democracies. How can this variation be explained?

Please cite the \nPublished Version.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \nA growing body of literature argues that democracies are more likely to comply with \ninternational agreements than authoritarian states (e.g. Gaubatz, 1996; Mansfield, \nMilner and Rosendorff, 2002; Smith, 1996). Such arguments often point to the \ndeterrent effect of democratic elections. Voters are believed to punish leaders who \nviolate international agreements by voting against them in the next election. This \nmakes it costly for democratically elected leaders to breach international agreements; \ndoing so reduces their chance of staying in office (McGillivray and Smith, 2000). \nElectorally minded leaders in democratic states therefore comply with international \nagreements to maximize their chances of re-election, according to conventional \nwisdom. The implication is that democratic states violate international agreements \nless frequently than authoritarian states.  \nHowever, significant variation in compliance behaviour exists amongst \ndemocracies. While some consistently comply with international agreements, others \nhabitually violate them. In fact, the most frequent violators of agreements negotiated \nwithin the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are high-functioning \ndemocracies with strong, credible opposition parties and regular competitive \nelections. This poses a puzzle for existing theories of democratic compliance, \nparticularly those that place primary importance on the deterrent effects of \ncompetitive elections. If elections deter non-compliance, as conventional wisdom \nsuggests, why do some democratically elected leaders violate international \nagreements more often than others?  \nA possible explanation is the significant variation in electoral competition that \nexists amongst democratic states. This variation is a result of the different rules used \nto elect leaders. In majoritarian systems, politicians need 50 percent plus one of the \nvotes in their electoral district to win (re)election; parties need to win a majority of the \n 3 \ndistricts to win control of the legislature. This engenders candidate-centred electoral \ncompetition where narrow interests have substantial political influence (e.g. Carey \nand Shugart, 1995; Persson & Tabellini, 2003). In contrast, proportional electoral \nrules (PR) engender party-centred competition. In these systems, parties work to \nmaximize their share of the national vote because this determines the number of \nlegislative seats the party will control. This variation in how democratic leaders are \nelected may help to explain why some democracies violate international agreements \nmore often than others. \nVirtually all international agreements have distributive consequences that \nmake some voters better off and others worse off (Tomz, 2002). For example, the \nWorld Trade Organization\u2019s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures \nrestrict the use of subsidies by member-country governments. Subsidies targeted to \nindividual industries or firms are explicitly banned by Articles 1 through 9.i These \nrestrictions are intended to increase economic efficiency and reduce costs to \nconsumers. Consumers, who constitute a large segment of countries\u2019 populations, \nbenefit from compliance with these rules. In contrast, narrow segments of the \npopulation, like domestic producers, lose out from compliance. Producers including \nindividual firms and industries would like to be able to earn rents from lucrative \ngovernment subsidies. They would prefer that their national government violate these \nrules. Non-compliance with this international agreement benefits narrow producer \ngroups; it serves their own self-interest. \nThis is an important point \u2013 one that has been largely overlooked in existing \nstudies of international compliance. If voters\u2019 preferences over compliance with an \ninternational agreement vary, the effect of democratic elections on compliance is \nambiguous. The impact of democracy will depend critically on the electoral incentives \n 4 \nfacing politicians and voter support for compliance. If, for example, compliance with \nan international agreement benefits broad-based groups, like consumers, then \npoliticians in proportional rule countries have relatively greater electoral incentives to \ncomply with the agreement. This is because the best electoral strategy for politicians \nand parties in proportional rule systems is to appeal to broad segments of the \npopulation in order to maximize the party\u2019s vote share (e.g. Carey and Shugart, 1995; \nPersson & Tabellini, 2003). Vote share determines the number of seats a party will \ncontrol in the country\u2019s legislature. By maximizing its vote share, a party maximizes \nits power in the legislature and its chances of being in government. This implies that \namongst democracies, those with proportional electoral rules are relatively more \nlikely to comply with international agreements that benefit broad segments of a \ncountry\u2019s population, such as the GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrow transfers. \nIn contrast, democracies with plurality (or majoritarian) electoral rules are \nrelatively more likely to violate GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrow transfers. By \nproviding narrow transfers, politicians can target benefits to constituents in their \ngeographically-defined district thereby increasing their chances of re-election (e.g. \nPersson & Tabellini, 2003). Parties competing in two-party majoritarian systems can \nuse narrow transfers to target benefits to key electoral districts.ii In this way, the \nprovision of narrow transfers maximizes the chances of electoral success for parties \nand politicians competing in majoritarian systems. The implication is that \ndemocracies with majoritarian electoral rules are more likely to violate GATT\/WTO \nrestrictions on narrow transfers, as compared to proportional rule democracies. \nInstances of non-compliance with GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrow \ntransfers amongst democratic member countries from 1980 to 2003 are analyzed here \nto assess the empirical validity of this argument. Consistent with expectations, \n 5 \nmajoritarian democracies are found to be more likely to violate GATT\/WTO \nrestrictions on narrow transfers, as compared to proportional rule democracies, \nholding all else equal. This finding is robust to the inclusion of numerous control \nvariables and model specifications.  \nThe main theoretical implication of this research is that the effect of \ndemocracy on compliance with international agreements is conditional rather than \ndirect. The consequences of democratic accountability depend critically on a \ncountry\u2019s electoral institutions and voters\u2019 interests. Democracy makes compliance \nmore likely when a state\u2019s electoral institutions privilege those voters that prefer \ncompliance. In contrast, democracy makes compliance less likely when electoral \ninstitutions advantage voters that favour non-compliance. This provides a possible \nexplanation for the previously unexplained variance in compliance behaviour amongst \ndemocratic states. The same mechanism that links regime type to compliance, namely \nelectoral competition, also explains variation in compliance amongst democracies.   \nThis research has important theoretical implications for several of the key \ndebates in International Relations including, for example, the degree to which the \ncauses of international political and economic trends are to be found at the domestic \nor international level (Frieden and Lake, 2000). While some International Relations \nscholars rule out explanations of international phenomena by reference to internal \ncharacteristics of the nation-state (e.g. Waltz, 1979), others argue that national \nconcerns can override global considerations. This research supports the latter view. A \ndemocratic state\u2019s compliance with international agreements depends critically on two \nkey internal characteristics: electoral institutions and voters\u2019 preferences over \ncompliance. Both the state (i.e. political institutions) and society play a significant \n 6 \nrole in countries\u2019 foreign economic policies, international relations, and compliance \nwith international agreements.  \nThe reminder of the paper is organized in six parts. Section 2 briefly discusses \nthe GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrowly targeted transfers. Sector 3 lays out the \ntheoretical argument as to why some democracies violate international agreements \nmore often than others. Section 4 describes the empirical tests of the theoretical \nexpectations derived in the previous section. The results of the empirical tests are \ndiscussed in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes the paper.  \nContext \nRestrictions on narrow transfers have long been the focus of multilateral \nnegotiations because they are believed to cause significant economic distortions. As \nearly as the Tokyo Round of 1979, narrowly targeted subsidies were regulated by \nGATT Articles VI, XVI and XXIII.iii Since then, restrictions on narrow transfers have \nbeen strengthened and expanded. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and \nCountervailing Measures (Articles 1 through 9) explicitly bans government subsidies \ntargeted exclusively to individual industries or firms. The use of narrowly targeted \ntransfers is implicitly restricted by other GATT\/WTO agreements that require general \nreductions in trade barriers and open market access. Under GATT\/WTO agreements, \nmember country governments are expected to refrain from privileging domestic \nproducers via narrowly targeted transfers and\/or trade barriers. \nCountries that choose to provide narrowly targeted transfers in violation of \nGATT\/WTO rules risk being filed against at the WTO\u2019s Dispute Settlement Body. \nThis entails potentially significant costs including international sanctions, the costs of \nparticipating in a GATT\/WTO dispute, reputation costs, and the costs of \ncompensating a plaintiff if ruled against by a Panel. Despite these costs, some \n 7 \ngovernments choose to provide narrow transfers in violation of GATT\/WTO rules. \nFor example, the United States\u2019 government imposed 30 percent tariffs on steel \nimports in March 2002. Within a few days, the European Union lodged a formal \ncomplaint with the World Trade Organization alleging that such tariffs were illegal. In \nNovember 2003, the WTO ruled that the American tariffs were illegal. Subsequently \nChina, the European Union, and Japan announced their intent to levy costly retaliatory \nsanctions against the United States (Mahncke, 2004). \nWhy would a democratically elected government choose to violate \nGATT\/WTO rules and risk costly international sanctions? Existing compliance \ntheories provide little insight. Democratic governments are generally expected to \ncomply with international agreements. Two key arguments are advanced in the \nliterature for why this may be the case. First, democracies may comply with \ninternational legal obligations because they share an affinity with prevalent \ninternational legal processes and institutions (e.g. Dixon, 1993; Slaughter, 1995). \nSecond, democracies may comply with international agreements because failure to do \nso entails costs for elected leaders (e.g. Leeds, 1999; McGillivray and Smith, 2000). \nThis argument rests on the critical assumption that voters punish leaders for violating \ninternational agreements by voting against them in the next election.iv Given these \narguments, how can the United States\u2019 decision on steel tariffs be explained and, more \ngenerally, the variation in compliance behaviour amongst democratic states?  \nTheory \nDemocratically elected governments violate international agreements when the \nelectoral benefits of doing so outweigh the domestic and international costs. The \ndomestic costs of providing an illegal narrow transfer include the actual budgetary \ncosts of the transfer, the opportunity costs of funding the transfer rather than some \n 8 \nother policy, and the potential economic distortions caused by the transfer.v The \ninternational costs of non-compliance include reputation costs and the potential costs \nof international sanctions. For example, extra duties (i.e. countervailing duties) can be \nimposed against illegally subsidized products. Such duties decrease the \ncompetitiveness of exports from defendant countries. Additionally, participation in the \ndispute settlement process entails resource costs, such as the financial, institutional, \nand human capital costs of litigating a dispute (Guzman and Simmons, 2005). \nAdditionally, governments must consider the potential costs of compensating the \nplaintiff if ruled against by a GATT\/WTO Panel. \nGovernments implement WTO-inconsistent policies when the electoral \nbenefits outweigh these costs. This is demonstrated by the United States\u2019 steel tariffs. \nDuring the course of the US presidential election campaign in 2000, George W. Bush \npromised to help the steel industry in Ohio and West Virginia in an attempt to win \nvotes in these key states. With the November 2002 midterm elections for the House of \nRepresentatives finely balanced, the Republicans needed to win the key steel-\nproducing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania (Read, 2005: 135). The US tariffs on steel \nwere an attempt by the Republican administration to win electoral support in key \nstates (Read, 2005). The electoral benefits of providing this illegal narrow protection \nfor the Republican Party appear to have outweighed the domestic and international \ncosts of violating GATT\/WTO rules.  \nThis illustrative example makes an important point; not all voters punish \nleaders for non-compliance with international agreements. Some voters will, in fact, \nreward leaders for violating international rules, as was the case in the key steel-\nproducing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. This point challenges a fundamental \nassumption in the domestic audience cost literature, namely that all voters value \n 9 \ncompliance and therefore punish leaders who violate international agreements. When \nvoters\u2019 preferences over compliance vary, the expected effect of democratic elections \non compliance is ambiguous.   \nDemocratically elected governments will provide illegal narrow transfers \nwhen the electoral benefits of doing so are substantial (i.e. when they outweigh the \ncosts). The electoral benefits of providing an illegal narrow transfer are more likely to \noutweigh the costs when politicians compete for (re)election under majoritarian \nelectoral rules in single-member districts. This is because of the unique nature of \nelectoral competition in countries with these electoral institutions, as demonstrated \nformally by theoretical models of electoral competition (e.g. Lizzeri and Persico, \n2001; Milesi-Ferreti et al., 2001; Persson and Tabellini, 1999, 2000, 2003).  \nIn such models, politicians and parties are assumed to be office-seeking. They \nwant to maximize their chances of re-election and to this end work to provide benefits \nto those voters most critical to their re-election chances. The identity of these voters is \ndetermined by the country\u2019s electoral rules. In majoritarian systems, the most \nimportant voters for a politician\u2019s re-election chances are those in the politician\u2019s \ngeographically-defined electoral district. Politicians need 50 percent plus one of the \nvotes in their electoral district to win (re)election in majoritarian systems. To secure \nthis outcome, politicians will work to provide narrowly targeted benefits those voters, \nfirms, and industries located in their district (e.g. Lizzeri and Persico, 2001; Milesi-\nFerreti et al., 2001; Persson and Tabellini, 1999, 2000, 2003).  \nThis incentive also exists for parties competing in two-party plurality rule \nsystems with single-member districts. In these systems, parties win control of the \nlegislature (and executive) district by district. To maximize their chances of winning \ncontrol, strategic parties target narrow transfers to key electoral districts. Because \n 10 \npoliticians and parties can use narrow transfers to target precisely those voters whose \nsupport they need to win re-election, these types of transfers are uniquely valuable in \ndemocracies with plurality electoral rules.vi  \nPlurality electoral rules tend to be closely associated with single-member \nelectoral districts. This empirical regularity provides further incentives for electorally \nminded politicians and parties to provide narrow transfers. Single member districts \ntend to be smaller than multimember districts (Powell and Vanberg, 2000). This \nincreases the influence of narrow, particularistic groups over elected representatives \n(e.g. Alt and Gilligan, 1994; Magee et al., 1989; Mansfield and Busch, 1995; \nMcGillivray, 2004; Rogowski, 1997).  McGillivray (2004: 28) provides the following \nillustrative example: An industry with 100 employees represents 10 percent of the \nelectorate in a district with 1,000 voters. The same industry represents only 0.1 \npercent of the electorate in a district of 100,000 voters. In the larger district, refusing \nto protect the industry is unlikely to affect the politician\u2019s re-election chances because \nthe industry is only 0.1 percent of the representative\u2019s electorate. In a district of \n100,000 voters, political representatives are forced to balance the interests of a greater \nvariety of industry groups. Given this, politicians elected via the smaller districts that \ntypically characterize countries with single-member districts have greater incentives \nto provide narrowly targeted transfers to their constituents.vii  \nDistrict size has been suggested as a possible explanation for the apparent \nprotectionist bias in majoritarian countries. For example, Magee, Brock and Young \n(1989) argue that larger electoral districts minimize the electoral incentives to provide \ntrade protection.viii Although the argument made here might be seen as a simple \nextension of existing arguments in the trade protection literature, a key question \nremains as to whether majoritarian democracies will provide WTO-inconsistent trade \n 11 \nprotections. Governments can (and do) provide protection from international trade in \nways that do not violate GATT\/WTO rules. For example, many countries\u2019 tariffs are \nset well below GATT\/WTO limits. Governments interested in providing protection \ncan do so by raising tariffs up to the agreed limit. Only by raising tariffs above this \nlevel do countries violate GATT\/WTO agreements. Why would countries choose to \nprovide illegal protection in violation of international agreements? This question is \nfundamentally distinct from the general question of why countries provide protection. \nThe argument made here suggests that governments choose to provide illegal narrow \ntransfers in violation of international agreements when the domestic electoral benefits \nof doing so outweigh the costs. This is more likely to occur in plurality rule \ndemocracies where narrow transfers provide unique and important electoral benefits \nto politicians facing competitive democratic elections.  \nIn proportional systems, politicians and parties have fewer electoral incentives \nto supply narrowly targeted transfers, even in the absence of international restrictions \n(e.g. Lizzeri and Persico, 2001; Persson and Tabellini, 2003; Rogowski, 1987, 1997). \nParties competing under proportional electoral rules do not win elections district by \ndistrict. In fact, no single district is critical to the electoral success of a party \n(McGillivray, 2004). Instead, parties work to maximize their aggregate vote share \nbecause this determines the number of legislative seats the party will control.ix By \ntargeting transfers to broad segments of the electorate, such as consumers, parties are \nable to \u201cbuy\u201d the electoral support of a wide range of voters dispersed across electoral \ndistricts. This is precisely the type of electoral support that is most beneficial to \nparties competing in multi-member districts under proportional rule. Because \nnarrowly targeted transfers provide relatively fewer electoral benefits to politicians \ncompeting in proportional rule systems, PR democracies are less likely to violate \n 12 \nGATT\/WTO rules on targeted transfers than plurality rule democracies, holding all \nelse equal. The following section describes the empirical tests of this theoretical \nexpectation. \nData and methods \nCompliance with standing, substantive rules embodied in international agreements is \ndifficult to measure. Using instances of non-compliance rather than compliance is a \nstraightforward way to overcome this difficulty.x Complaints filed with the \nGATT\/WTO Dispute Settlement Body over illegal narrow transfers are used to \nmeasure instances of non-compliance.xi The dependent variable is the cumulative \nnumber of complaints filed against a democratic GATT\/WTO member country over \nillegal narrow transfers in a given year (Complaints).  \nA vast majority of GATT\/WTO complaints are filed in response to an illegal \nnarrow transfer in the defendant country.xii This is confirmed by the fact that the \nmajority of all cases decided by a GATT\/WTO Panel yield a victory for the \ncomplainant country (Guzman and Simmons, 2005). Both developed and developing \ncountry complainants win approximately 90% of WTO cases (Guzman and Simmons, \n2005). This suggests that the variable Complaints is a valid measure of non-\ncompliance. In an attempt to further increase the validity of this measure, \nGATT\/WTO complaints that are explicitly political in nature and do not have at issue \nan illegal narrow protection are systematically excluded from the sample. For \nexample, the 1985 complaint filed by Nicaragua against the US in response to the \ntrade embargo imposed by the Reagan Administration is excluded. Excluding these \ntypes of complaints increases the validity of this measure. Additional coding criteria \nand sample restrictions are discussed in the appendix.  \n 13 \nDespite the restrictive coding criteria, it is possible that some complaints \nincluded in the sample were not filed in response to illegal narrow protection. These \ncases, if they exist, are \u2018false positives\u2019 (i.e. a complaint is observed where no \nviolation exists). This type of error will make it relatively more difficult to find \nevidence in support of the argument made here.  \nThis variable likely underestimates the frequency of non-compliant behaviour \nbecause not all instances of non-compliance engender a formal complaint. Filing a \ncomplaint entails costs for the plaintiff country. As a result, countries file complaints \nonly in select cases. A vast literature examines when and under what circumstances \ncountries chose to file a GATT\/WTO complaint. For example, Davis and Shirato \n(2007) argue that the characteristics of the affected export industry in the complainant \ncountry determine when WTO complaints are filed. Davis and Bermeo (2007) show \nthat the complainant country\u2019s domestic institutions and litigation experience play a \ncritical role in the country\u2019s decision to file a WTO dispute. Bown (2005) shows that \nexport stakes and retaliatory capacity account for much of the cross-national variation \nin dispute initiation.  \nThese studies and others suggest that the decision to file a complaint is not \nrandom. Although the decision is not random, it is unlikely to be influenced by a \ndefendant country\u2019s electoral rules. Plaintiff countries are no more likely to file \nagainst a majoritarian country with an illegal protection than a proportional country \nwith an illegal protection.xiii This is an important point. It suggests that any systematic \nrelationship found between a country\u2019s electoral rules and the number of complaints \nfiled against it is unlikely to be the result of selection bias.  \nGiven the discrete and non-negative properties of the dependent variable, it is \nappropriate to use an event count procedure to model the process underlying non-\n 14 \ncompliance with GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrow transfers. The negative \nbinominal model is used here because the count variable is overdispersed.xiv The \nnegative binomial model allows for this overdispersion and includes parameters for \nunobserved variance in the number of disputes across countries (King, 1989; Long, \n1997).  \nOne might argue that the zero inflated negative binomial model may be more \nappropriate for this analysis given that the modal number of disputes in any given \ncountry in any given year is zero. However, the large number of zeros in the count \nvariable may be the result of unobserved heterogeneity (Cameron and Trivedi, 1998; \nLong, 1997). Unobserved heterogeneity can cause both overdispersion and an \nincrease in the proportion of zeros. The negative binominal model can account for the \novedispersion and the excess zeros in the raw data. The negative binominal model \nresponds to the under prediction of zeros in the Poisson regression model by \nincreasing the conditional variance without changing the conditional mean (Long, \n1997). In contrast, zero modified count models change the mean structure to explicitly \nmodel the production of zero counts. This is done by assuming that zeros can be \ngenerated by a different process than positive counts. However, the theory advanced \nhere does not suggest that the zeros are generated by a different process. Given this, it \nis difficult to justify theoretically the use of the zero inflated negative binomial model. \nEstimating a zero-inflated negative binominal model does not produce dramatically \ndifferent results.xv In fact, no significant bias appears to be introduced by estimating \nthe more theoretically sound negative binominal model rather than the zero-inflated \nmodel. \nThe sample is an unbalanced panel of democratic GATT\/WTO member-\ncountries with yearly observations from 1980 to 2003. These data are used in a pooled \n 15 \ntime-series cross-section analysis with country-years as observations. The causal \nmechanism specified in the theoretical argument makes monadic predictions; \ngovernments in countries with majoritarian electoral rules and\/or single-member \ndistricts are more likely to implement WTO-inconsistent policies than governments in \nPR countries. As a result, majoritarian democracies are more likely to be named as \ndefendants in GATT\/WTO complaints than proportional rule democracies. The most \nappropriate unit of analysis for testing the empirical validity of this hypothesis is \nmonadic country-years.xvi  \nThe WTO replaced GATT as the organization overseeing the multilateral \ntrading system during the sample period (1995). Given this, a dummy variable coded \none for years during the WTO regime and zero otherwise is included in all estimated \nmodels. xviiixvii The base model also includes several addition control variables.  \nCountries with majoritarian electoral rules tend to have relatively larger economies, \non average. If a defendant\u2019s market size influences a plaintiff\u2019s decisions to file a \nformal complaint, as suggested by Gruzman and Simmons (2005), then a spurious \ncorrelation between majoritarian rules and complaints may exist. To minimize \nconcerns of a spurious correlation, defendant\u2019s market size measured by the country\u2019s \nGDP is included as a control variable in all estimated models.xix  \nPlaintiff, a dichotomous variable coded 1 if the country filed a complaint with \nthe GATT\/WTO Dispute Settlement Body in the previous year and 0 otherwise, is \nincluded to account for the possibility that some complaints are filed in retaliation for \nprevious complaints (Busch and Reinhardt, 2002).  \nExports, calculated as the amount of goods and services exported as a percent \nof GDP, is also included. International scrutiny of a country\u2019s compliance with \nmultilateral trade agreements likely increases as a country\u2019s exports grows. xx  \n 16 \nGDP per capita is included to account for the fact that developed countries \nhave historically used the GATT\/WTO dispute settlement procedures more often than \ndeveloping countries.  \nThe yearly rate of economic growth (Economic growth) is included to account \nfor the possibility that politicians in countries experiencing low or negative growth \nrates may face greater pressure to violate GATT\/WTO rules. Violating international \nrestrictions during times of adverse economic conditions may not entail the same \nreputation costs as doing so under normal economic conditions would (Drazen, 1997).  \nAlthough these control variables are not unrelated, standard tests show \nacceptable levels of multicolinearity.xxi Their inclusion in a single model does not \nintroduce undue bias. The results of the estimated models are reported in Table 1 and \ndiscussed in the following section.  \nResults \nAmongst democracies, the variation in compliance with GATT\/WTO agreements can \nbe explained, in part, by electoral institutions. Electoral institutions are robust \npredictors of non-compliance, as reported in Table 1.\nxxiii\nxxii  In Models 1 through 4, a \ncountry\u2019s electoral rule is measured using a simple dummy variable coded one if a \nmajority or all of the seats in the lower (or only) legislative chamber are elected via \nplurality electoral rules and 0 otherwise.   The effect of a country\u2019s mean district \nmagnitude is estimated in Models 5 through 8.xxiv Given the close correspondence \nbetween electoral rules and district magnitude, the two variables are not included \ntogether in the same model.  \n[Table 1 about here] \nAmongst high functioning democracies,xxv majoritarian electoral rules \nsignificantly increase the probability of violating GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrow \n 17 \ntransfers. Moving from a PR system to a majoritarian system increases the likelihood \nof non-compliance by nearly 7 percentage points in a single year. This effect is \nestimated using simulations via Clarify Software (King et al., 2000; Tomz et al., \n2001).xxvi On average, the expected number of violations in majoritarian democracies \nis 300 percent higher than in proportional rule (PR) democracies. \nDemocratic countries with single-member districts are also more likely to \nviolate GATT\/WTO rules regarding the provision of narrow transfers. Moving from \nan average sized multi-member district (i.e. one with 7 seats) to a single-member \ndistrict system increases the probability of non-compliance by more than 6 percentage \npoints in a single year. On average, the expected number of disputes in democratic \ncountries with single-member districts is 186 percent higher than in multi-member \ndistricts.  \nWhen the sample is expanded to include a broader group of democratic \ncountries,xxvii majoritarian electoral rules remain a robust predictor of non-\ncompliance, as reported in Models 3 and 4. Their estimated effect is slightly lower, \nhowever. Changing from a PR system to a majoritarian system increases the \nlikelihood of non-compliance in a given year by nearly 4 percentage points. Mean \ndistrict magnitude remains negatively related to non-compliance but no longer reaches \nconventional levels of statistical significance in the larger sample.  \nGiven the frequency with which the Unites States has been involved in \nGATT\/WTO disputes, readers might be concerned that the results reported here are \ndriven by the inclusion of the United States in the sample. However, this does not \nappear to be the case. When the United States is excluded, as in Model 2 Table 1, the \nestimated effect of Majoritarian actually increases slightly and remains statistically \n 18 \nsignificant at the 0.01 level. Mean District Magnitude also remains statistically \nsignificant but its effect is slightly smaller, as reported in Model 6 Table 1.   \nElectoral institutions remain robust to a number of additional \nspecifications.xxviii For example, both Majoritarian and Mean District Magnitude \nremain statistically significant when country size is measured using population rather \nthan GDP. Alternative lag structures matter little for the estimated coefficients for \nMajoritarian and Mean District Magnitude. This is perhaps unsurprising given that \nthese two variables change only very rarely over time.  \nSeveral other interesting findings deserve mention here. The WTO indicator \nvariable is positive and significant in 4 of the 8 models, namely those estimated using \nthe larger sample. This finding is consistent with previous studies that point to an \nincrease in the number of cases filed under the WTO regime (e.g. Petersmann, 1997). \nCountry size and income are also statistically significant in the more inclusive \nsample of democracies. Larger countries and those with higher per capita income are \nrelatively more likely to violate GATT\/WTO rules, all else equal. This may be \nbecause larger, richer countries are less sensitive to the international costs of non-\ncompliance. Alternatively, it may be that countries are more likely to file against big, \nrich defendants because there are relatively greater benefits to be gained from these \ncases (Gruzman and Simmons, 2005). This confirms the importance of controlling for \ncountry size. This is particularly important when estimating the effect of electoral \nrules on non-compliant behaviour. If large countries are more likely to be filed against \nand they are more likely to have majoritarian electoral rules, a spurious correlation \nbetween electoral rules and complaints may exist. However, by including measures of \ncountry size in all estimated models, the possibility of finding a spurious correlation is \nminimized.xxix \n 19 \nConclusion \nConventional wisdom suggests that democracies are more likely to comply with \ninternational agreements than autocracies. However, substantial variation in \ncompliance behaviour exists amongst democracies. To date, this variation has gone \nlargely unexplained. This article offers a possible account for the observed variance in \ncompliance with GATT\/WTO agreements among democracies. In a world where \ndemocracy is spreading, it is especially important to understand democratic states\u2019 \ncompliance with international agreements.  \nAmongst democracies, variation in compliance with international agreements \ncan be explained in part by electoral institutions. Democratic countries with \nmajoritarian electoral rules violate GATT\/WTO restrictions on the use of narrowly \ntargeted transfers, such as industry-specific subsidies, more frequently than countries \nwith proportional electoral systems. This is because majoritarian rules provide \npoliticians with electoral incentives to supply transfers to narrow, select segments of \nthe country\u2019s population. This incentive derives from the winner-takes-all \ncharacteristics of majoritarian electoral rules and the nature of electoral competition in \nsingle-member districts. In contrast, proportional electoral rules and multi-member \ndistricts generate incentives for politicians and parties to target benefits to broader \nsegments of the electorate. As a result, governments elected via proportional rules are \nmore likely to comply with GATT\/WTO restrictions on narrowly targeted transfers as \nthese restrictions tend to benefit consumers.  \nAlthough this research focuses on compliance with a particular international \nagreement, the theoretical implications are relevant for virtually all international \nagreements. This is because virtually all international agreements have distributive \nconsequences that make some voters better off and others worse off. Consider, for \n 20 \nexample, an international environmental agreement. Although such an agreement \ngenerates benefits for many (perhaps all) citizens, it entails substantial costs for some. \nFor example, producers using environmentally unfriendly technologies will find \ninternational environmental agreements costly. The theory advanced in this paper \nsuggests that when such groups are critical to leaders\u2019 electoral success, leaders will \nbe less concerned with (and committed to) compliance with international \nenvironmental agreements. This may explain, for example, the United States\u2019 refusal \nto ratify the Kyoto Protocol.  \nBecause virtually all international agreements have distributive consequences, \nsome voters will prefer non-compliance. Democracy may therefore make compliance \nless likely. The effect of democracy on compliance depends critically on the political \nimportance of voters that favour non-compliance. When a state\u2019s democratic \ninstitutions privilege \u2018non-compliance voters\u2019, violations of international agreements \nwill be more likely. In contrast, when electoral institutions privilege those voters that \nfavour compliance, democracy will make compliance more likely. In sum, the effect \nof democracy on compliance is conditional on a country\u2019s electoral institutions and \nthe interests of voters.  \nThis provides a potential explanation for the observed variation in compliance \nbehaviour amongst democracies. It also provides a possible reason for the mixed \nempirical evidence found to date on the effect of regime type on compliance. While \nsome studies show that democracies honour their international commitments more \nregularly than authoritarian states (e.g. Mansfield, Milner and Rosendorff 2002), \nothers find either a negative or a negligible correlation between democracy and \ncompliance. For example, Remmer (1998) finds little evidence of a positive \nrelationship between democracy and commercial cooperation. Simmons (2000) finds \n 21 \nthat amongst those countries that joined the International Monetary Fund before 1980, \ndemocracies showed a greater tendency to violate international commitments. The \ntheory advanced in this paper suggests a possible explanation for these mixed findings \nand an important avenue for future research. To better understand the effect of regime \ntype on compliance with international agreements, we must develop and test theories \nabout which voters prefer non-compliance and when they are likely to be electorally \ndecisive. This research takes an important first step in this direction. \nThis research makes several additional contributions. First, it demonstrates \nthat WTO-inconsistent policies are neither random nor uniform across states. The \nsupply of potential cases (i.e. WTO-inconsistent policies) is often taken as exogenous \nin studies of GATT\/WTO disputes (e.g. Davis and Shirato 2007).xxx However, this \nresearch suggests that to fully understand the pattern of GATT\/WTO disputes, one \nmust account for the likelihood of a WTO-inconsistent policy in the defendant state. \nThis depends in part on the country\u2019s electoral institutions.  \nSecond, this research confirms the increasingly common claim that \nmajoritarian democracies are relatively more protectionist than proportional rule \ndemocracies (e.g. Evans, 2009; Grossman and Helpman, 2005). The novel result \nreported here is that governments in majoritarian systems are willing to protect \ndomestic producers even when doing so violates their international obligations. The \ntheoretical implication is that national electoral concerns can at times override \ninternational considerations. This speaks to the ongoing debate in International \nRelations over the degree to which the causes of international political and economic \ntrends are to be found at the domestic or international level. This research \ndemonstrates the importance of domestic politics for compliance with international \nagreements. It appears that the nation-state remains a powerful and independent actor \n 22 \nwhose internal structures shape foreign economic policy and international relations, \ndespite the dramatic increase in international interdependence and the proliferation of \ninternational agreements. Kindleberger\u2019s (1969) pronouncement that \u2018the nation-state \nis just about through as an economic unit\u2019 appears to have been premature. \n 23 \nReferences  \nAllee, Todd (2009) \u2018Going to Geneva?

These \ninclude: (1) complaints over broad transfers and\/or policies that affect a wide range of \ngoods, producers, or industries, like, for example, the 1982 dispute over the value \nadded tax (VAT) threshold; (2) complaints related to the enforcement of intellectual \nproperty rights; (3) complaints filed against the European Community\/European \nUnion unless it is very clear which EC\/EU member the complaint was filed in \nresponse to; (4) complaints related to anti-dumping measures because anti-dumping \nmeasures are imposed in response to a foreign firm\u2019s policy rather than a foreign \ngovernment\u2019s policy; (5) complaints that are explicitly political in nature like, for \nexample, the 1985 complaint filed by Nicaragua against the US in response to the \ntrade embargo imposed by the Reagan Administration. Complaints over \ncountervailing duties are included only after carefully examining the GATT\/WTO \nPanel Reports to correctly identify the country initially accused of having an illegal \nnarrow transfer. Complaints filed by multiple countries over a single illegal narrow \ntransfer are counted only once against the defendant country. Two independent coders \nidentified the set of relevant disputes using these coding criteria. The percentage \nagreement between the two coders was approximately 98 percent.  \n \n  \n \n                                                 \ni There are, of course, exceptions. For example, agriculture is largely exempt from \nthese restrictions.  \n 30 \n                                                                                                                                            \nii A debate exists in the literature as to whether parties target swing districts or safe \ndistricts. See, for example, Cox and McCubbins (1986), Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) \nand Dixit and Londregan (1996). For this paper, the distinction is not critical. Both \narguments point to the importance of providing benefits to narrow, geographically-\ndefined constituencies in majoritarian systems. \niii Changes in negotiation rules implemented during the Kennedy Round (1964-67) \nmay, in fact, be viewed as the first attempt to limit narrowly targeted benefits. Under \nthe new rules, linear reductions in tariffs were negotiated rather than item-by-item \nreductions. \niv Another theory argues that democracies are relatively less likely to provide trade \nprotections (e.g. Mansfield, Milner and Rosendorff 2000; Milner and Kubota, 2005). \nAlthough the reasons given for this vary, the expectation is that democratically elected \nleaders have fewer incentives to provide protection than autocratic leaders.  \nv Additionally, voters that favour compliance may vote against leaders that violate \ninternational agreements in the next election thereby imposing \u2018domestic audience \ncosts\u2019 (Fearon, 1994). \nvi This has been suggested as a possible explanation for the apparent protectionist bias \nin majoritarian countries (e.g. Grossman and Helpman 2005; Willmann 2004). \nvii However, Karol (2007) finds no empirical support in the United States for the claim \nthat larger constituencies makes politicians less protectionist.  \nviii Single member districts also allow voters to assign credit for the provision of \ntargeted transfers. In multimember districts, voters do not know which of their \nrepresentatives to credit for providing targeted transfers (Ashworth and Bueno de \nMesquita, 2006). Voters observe the total amount of transfers provided to the district \nbut not the amount produced by individual legislators. This reduces the domestic \n 31 \n                                                                                                                                            \nelectoral benefits of providing narrowly targeted transfers in multi-member districts. \nAs such, politicians in multi-member districts may be unwilling to work to provide \nnarrow transfers in violation of GATT\/WTO rules because the costs of doing are \nlikely to outweigh the benefits. \nix However, Monroe and Rose (2002) show that districting matters for partisan \nelectoral outcomes in PR systems under certain circumstances.  \nx Leeds (2003) takes a similar approach by examining instances of non-compliance \nwith alliance commitments. \nxi Data are from Hudec (1993), Reinhardt (1996), Allee (2009) and the WTO (2005). \nThe coding criteria used to identify relevant disputes are detailed in the appendix. \nTwo independent researchers coded the complaints using to these criteria. The \npercentage agreement between the two coders was 98 percent. \nxii Eighty percent during the period from 1980-1994; sixty-six percent during 1995-\n2003. \nxiii However, majoritarian systems tend to be more frequent in large countries. The \nsize of a defendant country (or market) may influence plaintiff country\u2019s decisions to \nfile a formal complaint. To control for this, I include various measures of the \ndefendant countries\u2019 economic size in all estimated models (GDP and GDP per \ncapita). I also include measures of a defendant country\u2019s population and area in \nmodels run as robustness checks. Importantly, electoral rules remain a robust \npredictor of the number of GATT\/WTO complaints filed against a given country \ncontrolling for various measures of country\u2019s size. This minimizes the possibility that \nthe positive correlation between majoritarian electoral rules and WTO-inconsistent \npolicies is spurious.  \n 32 \n                                                                                                                                            \nxiv The mean value of Complaints is 0.17; the standard deviation is 0.55. Although the \nunconditional variance is greater than the unconditional mean, the dispersion \nparameter, alpha, closely approximates zero in several of the estimated models. When \nalpha is equal to zero, the negative binominal distribution is equivalent to a Poisson \ndistribution.  \nxv Exports are used to predict zero counts. Countries that export nothing to the global \nmarket arguably face little scrutiny of their domestic transfers. However, Exports is \nnot a robust predictor of the incidence of zeros. Importantly, the estimated coefficients \nfor the key variables of interest (Majoritarian and Mean District Magnitude) are very \nsimilar to those estimated using a negative binominal model; the standard errors are \nrelatively lower.  \nxvi Although dyadic studies have become increasingly common in the GATT\/WTO \nliterature, several recent papers question this trend. Rose (2008) argues that monadic \ntests may be more appropriate than dyadic tests for understanding the expected effects \nof the GATT\/WTO on countries\u2019 trade policy decisions. Similarly, Allee and Scalera \n(2009) make a strong case for using monadic rather than dyadic data to examine the \neffects of GATT\/WTO accession on domestic policy. Dai (2006) illustrates the \npotential pitfalls of testing monadic theories using dyadic data.  \nxvii A fully interacted model is also estimated to test for equality of coefficients across \nthese two regimes. The estimated coefficients for both Majoritarian and Mean \nDistrict Magnitude are remarkably consistent across the two regimes.  \nxviii All control variables are lagged one year. Alternative lag structures were tested. \nFor example, Plaintiff was lagged for two years rather than just one. However, this did \nnot significantly alter the key findings.  \n 33 \n                                                                                                                                            \nxix Population and area are used as alternative indicators of size. These results are not \nreported here but are available from the author upon request. Importantly, the key \nresults are robust to the inclusion of these alternative measures of country size.  \nxx Data on all economic variables come from the World Development Indicators \n(World Bank 2005).  \nxxi The variance inflation factor (VIF) is less than 4 for all variables included in the \nestimated models, as recommended by Huber et al. (1993). \nxxii These results are consistent with those reported by Davis (2008).  \nxxiii These data come from the Database of Political Institutions (Beck et al., 2001).  \nxxiv These data come from Johnson and Wallack (2005). Using a measure of mean \ndistrict magnitude taken from the Database of Political Institutions (Beck et al., 2001) \nproduced very similar results.  \nxxv Here, the sample includes only those countries with a Polity score greater than 8. \nxxvi For countries under the WTO regime that did not file a complaint in the previous \nyear. All quantitative control variables are set equal to their median values. \nxxvii Here, the sample is expanded to include all countries with Polity scores greater \nthan 6.  \nxxviii For example, electoral institutions remain robust predictors of non-compliance \neven when a measure of rule of law is included. Previous research demonstrates that \ncountries with strong rule-of-law traditions are more likely to comply with \ninternational agreements (Simmons 2000).  \nxxix Although countries self select into electoral rules, there is little reason to believe \nthat this non-random selection biases the reported results. Countries predisposed to \nprotection are no more likely to choose majoritarian electoral rules than proportional \nrules (Boix 1999). Instead, a country\u2019s selection of electoral rules depends critically \n 34 \n                                                                                                                                            \non ethnic and\/or religious fragmentation (Boix 1999, Rokkan 1970). Although \nfragmentation influences a country\u2019s choice of electoral system, it is unlikely to \ninfluence the country\u2019s trade policies. Thus, the possibility of a spurious correlation or \nselection bias is minimal. Further evidence of this is provided by empirical tests that \ninclude an indicator of the historical period during which the country adopted the \nelectoral rules in use at the time of the observation. If there are historical trends in \nelectoral institutions, then the period during which a country\u2019s electoral rules were \nchosen is likely correlated with the selection and therefore the conditional-\nindependence assumption is more credible when this variable is included in the \nestimated model. These results are available from the author upon request. Controlling \nfor the age of a country\u2019s electoral institutions, countries with majoritarian electoral \nrules are more likely to be named as defendants in GATT\/WTO complaints.  \nxxx A notable exception is Allee (2009).  \n"}
