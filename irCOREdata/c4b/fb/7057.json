Such applications usually provide large stores of information which can be\naccessed in a wide variety of ways. Typical access facilities provided within such applications\ninclude Boolean search engines and hypermedia (non-linear) browsing. These types of\napproach often centre on providing human-computer dialogues which are relatively low on\ninteraction. The interactive-laboratory approach, however, aims to limit the quantity of\ninformation presented, and instead to provide a highly interactive learning environment. In\nthe field of psychology, users are able interactively to design and deliver a broad range of\npsychological experiments. This paper details the approach, and describes how it can be used\nto teach psychology within a university environment. The way in which its effectiveness as a\nlearning tool can be evaluated is also discussed\nIntroduction\nEducational technology is currently receiving a great deal of attention and resource,\nparticularly in higher education. The reason for this is that higher-education\nestablishments are being required to deliver ever-increasing numbers of graduates on ever-\ntightening budgets. A number of approaches can be taken to counter the problems\nassociated with this situation. Some institutions are building ever-bigger lecture theatres to\nallow greater numbers of students to access the expertise of the teacher. But this approach\ntends to produce passive learning experiences when compared to the interactive learning\nwhich often takes place when only small numbers of students are addressed, and although\nsuch lectures are useful, within many subject domains the transmission of appropriate\nprocedural, experimental and practical skills is essential to useful learning experiences.\nAnother approach, as readers of this journal will know, centres on the use of computer\ntechnology for the dissemination of both skills and knowledge, since computer-based\nlearning applications can provide an interactive medium for learning experiences. Many\ntraditional paper-based learning-support materials are essentially static and unreactive:\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\ninformation is usually presented in a predetermined way with a fixed set of pedagogical\nobjectives. Although users are often able to override such objectives, interaction with\ntraditional learning materials is limited (see Richards, 1993), while interactive computer-\nbased learning environments are able to respond to the individual requirements of users\nfrom information elicited through the interaction process. In this way, a learner-centred\napproach can be adopted. Although this does not preclude teacher-centred approaches, it\nnevertheless allows individual users to tailor their learning experiences.\nRelated work\nA number of programs have been written which make use of an experimental laboratory\napproach to the teaching of psychology (see, for example, Chute, 1989; Tversky, 1990; see\nalso Cox et al, 1992). Several programs of this kind are reviewed in detail in Psychology\nSoftware News, for instance Laboratory in Cognition and Perception (Smith, 1990). This\ntypical application allows users to run experiments in a number of areas within the\ngeneral field of cognition and perception, and when the program is operating in advanced\nmode, users are able to set a number of parameters prior to running an experiment.\nResults are stored in files which can then be analysed fully at a later date. But this\napplication was designed for relatively primitive computing technology by today's\nstandards, as shown by the fact that although a colour monitor is recommended, all the\nexperiments are designed so that they can be delivered in monochrome. Today's\ntechnology allows far more ambitious uses of a laboratory approach. In particular,\nmultimedia provides a much broader scope for both the quality and the range of\nexperimental work that can be supported. In any case, the use of multimedia aside, such\napplications differ from the genuine interactive laboratory in the following ways:\n\u2022 they do not employ multiple pedagogic strategies;\n\u2022 student remediation strategies are usually not embedded;\n\u2022 neither existing laboratory materials nor experiment generators are integrated.\nObjectives\nThe principle objective in this area of my research, therefore, is to create highly interactive\nlearning materials which allow students to become actively engaged in the setting up and\ndelivery of psychological experiments. These experiments are to be controlled through the\nuse of graphical user-interfaces which will allow relatively naive computer users rapidly to\ndevelop, deliver and analyse data for a wide range of psychological theories and concepts,\nthe whole being enhanced through the use of multimedia technologies. In addition,\nappropriate existing software can be integrated into the system. This requires copyright\nclearance from authors and, of course, some changes may need to be made to such\napplications to allow their integration into the interactive laboratory, which means\nobtaining permission to make alterations to the source code. The resulting learning\nmaterials are being developed and integrated in close consultation with academic staff\nengaged in teaching psychology at Newcastle University.\nOf course, a major factor in the success of such software is the degree to which students\nuse, enjoy and learn from the approach that has been adopted. Simply providing\nstimulating and interactive learning environments does not guarantee success. Methods\n19\nStephen Richards Computer-based learning in psychology\nare required to monitor student take-up, continued use, and attitudes towards the\nmaterials and strategies used for its delivery. For these reasons, it is also the objective of\nmy current research to develop extensions to the system for monitoring who uses it, when\nthey use it and for how long.\nDevelopment environment\nA wide range of environments can be adopted for the development of interactive\nlaboratories. There are, however, a number of features which are potentially extremely\nimportant, and which I now outline, as well as the way in which the adopted environment\naddresses the problems of delivering the necessary facilities.\nHardware\nThe use of interactive computer-based learning materials in an educational environment\nrepresents a delicate balance between cost and power. Fortunately, the rapid reduction in\nthe cost\/power differentials of desktop computers has meant that appropriate\ntechnologies are now widely available. In the Psychology Department at the University of\nNewcastle, there has been a move towards the use of Macintosh networks. The principal\nstudent machine, therefore, will be based on new Macintosh LC475s which have already\nbeen installed in one of the laboratories. These are networked (along with the other\nMacintosh machines in the department) using Ethernet and AppleTalk.\nThe development machine (which will later act as a file server) is a Macintosh Centris\n660AV. This machine has a number of advantages for the development of the interactive\nlaboratory which stem from its in-built audio-visual capability, including integral audio\/\nvideo digital signal processing hardware and a multi-session double-spin CD-ROM drive.\nApple Macintosh machines have long been equipped with audio digital signal processing\nhardware as standard, something which has given Apple an advantage over IBM-\ncompatible hardware in the move towards multimedia. The audio circuitry is capable of\nproducing 16-bit stereo audio with sampling rates of 22.05, 24, 44.1 and 48 kHz. The\nCentris 660AV, however, has the additional capacity to take in analogue video signals\nand produce digital video files for delivery from hard disk. North American, UK, and\nEuropean video standards (NTSC, PAL and SECAM) are all supported. The video\nsource (which may be a camcorder, video cassette recorder, or videodisk) can be linked\nthrough either the composite video or the SuperVHS port. Film clips can then be\nrecorded to the hard disk in QuickTime digital video format. If the audio channel is also\nconnected, the audio stream is interleaved to form a digital audio\/video file. Such files can\nthen be delivered in software alone on machines which do not possess the specialized\nvideo hardware. As for CD-ROM, the multi-session capability of the drive in the Centris\n660AV means that CD-ROM discs can be written to more than once. This is a problem\nfor some drives as they are only able to read discs which have been written in a single\nsession, but such multi-session compatibility is essential for handling Kodak PhotoCD\ndiscs. It is possible to create a PhotoCD disc, then have additional images added at a later\ndate (hence the term m\u00ab\/f\/-sessionj.\nAuthoring\nMost of my development work so far for the interactive laboratory has been based\n20\nALTJ VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\naround HyperCard 2.19, though this has recently been upgraded to 2.2. This new release\nprovides significant increases in both power and flexibility, and in particular offers\nsupport for colour and multimedia. Colour was previously available to developers of\nHyperCard stacks only through the use of third-party executable commands and\nfunctions. Such facilities have now been included with HyperCard in the form of the\nColorTools extensions which allow PICT format graphics files to be imported and\nresized. In addition, ColorTools allows the colouring of HyperCard objects such as\nbuttons, fields, cards, and backgrounds. Multimedia support is provided through the\nintegration of QuickTime and ADDmotion tools. ADDmotion provides 24-bit colour\npaint, animation and sound extensions. The QuickTime extensions allow interleaved\ndigital video\/audio files to be controlled from within HyperCard. A wide variety of\nwindow types and control options can now be simply embedded within an application\nusing the toolkit provided. This means that video, animation and sound can now be\ncontrolled (with relative ease) from within HyperCard.\nExperiment generators\nIt is envisaged that the use of two experiment generators (MindLab and SuperLab) will be\nintegrated into the interactive laboratories. The modules that have been developed to\ndate, however, have made use only of SuperLab {SuperLab, 1991) which allows\npsychological experiments to be set up and delivered on a computer. Both visual and\nauditory stimuli can be presented, and reaction times can be recorded accurately through\na wide selection of input devices.\nOne of the features of SuperLab that makes it particularly useful in this type of work is\nthe file formats it produces. Two basic types of file are used: script and output. The script\nfile provides all the information SuperLab needs in order for it to run an experiment,\nwhile the output file stores a record of the stimuli presented, user-responses and reaction\ntimes. Both these files are tab-delimited text files. This means that a SuperLab-compatible\nscript file can be generated within other environments, then SuperLab invoked with the\ngenerated script file. In addition, although the output file is a Microsoft Excel file, it\nsimply consists of tab-delimited text and can therefore be imported into a wide range of\napplications.\nDesign, monitoring and pedagogic strategy\nAlthough an interactive-laboratory approach can be used to teach a variety of scientific\nsubjects, my current research is limited to teaching psychology. The following section\ntherefore describes the general design and implementation of an interactive laboratory for\npsychology.\nInterface design\nOne of the key problems with developing materials for teaching non-computing\ndisciplines can be the relative lack of computing skills exhibited by some of the potential\nusers. This is a particular problem with first-year students who may have little or no\ncomputing experience. Naturally, as part of any modern degree course in psychology, the\nuse of computer resources has become a necessity, something which can result in a\nsubstantial load for non-computer-literate students. I have therefore adopted a highly\n21\nStephen Richards Computer-based learning in psychology\ngraphical approach to user-interface design. The two principle interaction methods within\nany graphical user-interface are menus and icons. Although the interactive laboratory\nmakes use of both these strategies simultaneously, all essential navigation controls are\nprovided iconically at the base of the screen. This allows the completely naive user to be\nable rapidly to access the essential set of sub-functions without a significant learning\ncurve. A greater range and subtlety of interaction is available through the menus for users\nwho are more experienced.\nUser monitoring\nThe two most common methods used to address the problem of additional assistance for\nstudents experiencing learning problems are testing and interaction monitoring. Testing\ncan be effective when students obtain immediate feedback on their performance on\ncomputer-based tests embedded in the learning environment. The object of this strategy is\nthat it allows students to effect their own remedial action. But associated problems\ninclude de-motivation through poor attainment, lack of constructive personal feedback,\nand, in some cases, an inability to take appropriate remedial action. For these reasons, I\nhave opted for interaction monitoring. This can take many forms, ranging from recording\nevery interaction that the user makes within an application, to keeping a simple record of\nthe length of time spent using a particular part of the application. Where all interactions\nare recorded, a very large amount of information is generated which in itself can obscure\nthe identification of those students who may require remedial action. Thus, in the\ninteractive laboratory, a time-monitoring strategy using student log files has been\nadopted, implemented in such a way that when a teacher accesses student-monitoring\nJnteractiue lab ,\ntttademt l e g arc1 I \u2022 \" ( * '\n\u00a3C\nAtkinson Adeil 8\nDewson Anthony\nJones Andrew\nJones Brian\nLawson George\nNott Ken\nPeterson Steve\nRagworth Julie\nRichards Stephen\nSheldon Peter\nSmith Helen\nTomllnson Janet\nXanadu Steve\nUse the scrollbar on the \"Student names\"\nlist to bring your name Into view,\nSelect your name by clicking on It in the\nlist using the mouse.\nAfter a moment your password wil l be\nrequested.

This means that students who either fail to access a particular\nmodule, or who take a disproportionately long time to complete a particular module, can\nbe easily identified. (Such information is naturally held in protected files to prevent\nunauthorized viewing.)\n22\nALTJ VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nPedagogic strategies\nThree basic pedagogic strategies are implemented within the interactive laboratory. These\ninvolve the delivery of theoretical background information, the provision of instruction\nfor the various software tools, and interactive control of practical sessions.\nThe delivery of background information is based on a simple presentation. This involves\nseveral screens of information outlining the key features of research conducted in the\narea, and any details of how current methodology differs from the original work.\nHowever, in order to avoid long periods of reading from screen, information is kept to a\nminimum and relies on references to further reading.\nAt present, the training approach to the use of software tools supports only a brief\nintroduction to SuperLab. Users are provided with active learning facilities which allow\nthem to toggle between SuperLab and the instructional materials, thus providing real-\ntime training. In this way, they are led through the process of running experiments\ninteractively within a SuperLab session. Through the use of this technique, even students\nwho have no knowledge of SuperLab, and who are also low in computing experience, are\nable successfully to run experiments from within the SuperLab environment.\nThe educational approach to the laboratory sessions is based on an active learning\nstrategy. Naturally, the specific design of each laboratory session is specific to an\nindividual module, since the particular features of each experiment have a determining\neffect on the facilities and methods employed in the user-interface. Even so, the basic\nstrategy is to allow users to set up a wide range of experimental parameters. In this way,\nstudents can design their own experiment which they are then able to deliver through the\ncomputer. Results data is automatically collected into a file of their choice for later\nstatistical analysis.\n20 Rotation\nLobs Mania.\nF leoge Bight 30\nF Itlrrer Right 30\nF tilrror Left 60\nr leoge Right 60\nF Itlrror 180\nF lug* Left 120\nFfllrror Right SO\nF fllrror Right SO\nF l\u00bbooe Bight 90\ni Left\nt Blgh'\nSSL.\nF leage Right ISO\nF Jilrrsr Right ISO\nF leoge 180\nFR30\nFbfOO\nFbUO\nFB60\nFbiBO\nFt, 120\nFbBCO\nFMQ0\nFROO\n-OSSL\nFR1S0\nFMtSO\nF180\nDialogue\nDirection\nType\nLetter\ngjo_fe\nLeft \u2022\u00bb\u2022\n'T w\nF \u2022\nOK\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nTae aethods for setting up your\nexperiment or* available:\nDialogue; and Edit.

The experiment-generator approach involves the creation of\n23\nStephen Richards Computer-based learning in psychology\ninterfaces which allow the necessary parameters to be written to a SuperLab script.\nSuperLab is then invoked to deliver the stimuli and collect the data. The direct coding\napproach can involve the modification and use of existing software and\/or the complete\ncoding of new modules in HyperCard. In the following outline case studies, both of these\napproaches are illustrated.\nMental rotation\nA laboratory session has been produced which addresses the issues of mental rotation\nfollowing the work of Shepard and Metzler (1971). This experiment measures the time\ntaken (in milliseconds) to rotate an image or a mirror image mentally to its original\norientation. For the purposes of this experiment, SuperLab was integrated to deliver the\nexperimental stimuli and collect the resulting data. This was achieved by launching the\nrun-time version of SuperLab with a generated SuperLab script file from within a\nHyperCard stack.\nWithin the interactive laboratory, SuperLab script files are created from the parameters\nset by students. This is achieved through selecting the parameters required for each event\nwithin a particular experiment using a graphical user-interface. Once the parameters for\nall events have been set, they are then passed to SuperLab via the script file. At present,\nthe interactive laboratory supports up to 200 events within a single experimental\nadministration.\n'4 File Edit EHpertment TUB I 1 :\nBlocks Trials Stlmull\/Euents\nblock! o instructions\no1FR30\n\u00ab2FbR30\no 3FDL60\nO4FR60\n\u00bb5Fbl80\nO6F1120\no7FbR60\no instructions\ne 1\n\u00ab2\n\u00bb3\no4\no5\n06\no7\nF nirror Right 60\nF dln-cr Right 90\nF leoge Right 00\nF leoge Left 60\nF laoge Right ISO\nF ttlrrer Right ISO\nF laoge ISO\nFbfteO\nFbR90\nFB00\nFL60\nFR130\nFW1S0\nF180\nOiologus; and Edit.

This involved making use of an existing set of\nHyperCard stacks which were developed for the delivery of words and nonsense words\nusing digital audio techniques. A full description of the original work can be found in\nCox, Hulme and Brown (1992). In order to integrate this set of stacks, it was necessary to\nsupplement the original code so that students could be provided with a brief introduction\n24\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nto the background theory, and online instruction on setting up and running experiments\nusing the module. It was also necessary to embed the code for logging student interaction.\nFuture directions\nAlthough I have discussed the monitoring of student interaction in the context of\nremediation, such monitoring can of course also be used in the wider context of software\nevaluation. This provides one of the key issues to be addressed in the near future as the\nmodules go online in the teaching of psychology. In addition, although the use of text,\ngraphics and digital audio has been mentioned above, the full potential of multimedia has\nnot been addressed.\nMultimedia\nThe strict definition of multimedia is the use of a number of presentation modalities\nwithin a computing environment, but it is sometimes - indeed often - taken to mean the\nuse of digital motion video. Until very recently the use of digital video was almost\nprohibitively complex. More recently, however, improvements in hardware and software\ntools have meant that it can now be usefully employed in a wide range of applications\n(Richards and Barker, 1994).\nWithin the interactive laboratory, a number of uses for digital video are being\ninvestigated. Areas currently under investigation include eye-witness testimony and\nanimal behaviour experiments.\nIn the eye-witness testimony work, QuickTime movies will be used to deliver digital-video\nscenarios to subjects from a scenario library held on CD-ROM. Students will be able to\nselect a variety of approaches to gathering eye-witness testimonies via the computer which\nmay include multiple-choice, free-flow response, structured response, graphical\nrepresentations of evidence, and simulated identity parades.\nIt is envisaged that animal and human-behaviour experiments will be presented to\nstudents through the creation of an integrated behaviour-recording environment.\nEffectively, field studies will be simulated by presenting digital video clips from a resource\nlibrary, and students will be able to specify the behaviours to be recorded along with the\nassociated codes and key responses. Behaviour and timing information can then be\nrecorded by the student while viewing the selected digital video clip.\nEvaluation\nFormal assessment of the impact of the approach described in this paper to teaching\npsychology will be conducted over the coming year. In addition to measuring the overall\nimpact of the software, attempts will be made to identify the types of student who can\nbenefit from such an approach, and perhaps more importantly, the types of student for\nwhom such an approach may be inappropriate.\nA number of tools are under development to support this evaluation process. As already\nmentioned, the logging of student interaction is already in place and it is expected that\nthis will yield useful data. In addition, questionnaires are being formulated which will\naddress the use of such methods from both educationist and student perspectives.\n25\nStephen Richards Computer-based learning in psychology\nConclusion\nThe work described in this paper illustrates the way in which a number of pedagogic\napproaches can be implemented using computer-based learning materials. These include\nboth relatively passive information presentation and highly active learning strategies in\nthe form of interactive experiments and real-time training. In addition, the work\nillustrates ways in which computers can be used to augment traditional approaches to\nteaching psychology. In many instances, traditional teaching methods can no longer\nsupport the extremely large numbers of students now faced by the modern lecturer\nundertaking practical work. The interactive-laboratory approach can facilitate access to\nactive learning experiences.\nFinally, although the focus of the work described here has been within the field of\npsychology, it is clearly possible to apply the same techniques within a variety of disciplines.\nMultimedia could have a particularly large impact in this regard, allowing the creation of\nlife-like simulations which it otherwise may be difficult or impossible for students to access.\nAcknowledgements\nI acknowledge the University of Newcastle for funding through the Teaching Initiatives\nFund; Charles Hulme for permission to integrate the Short-Term Memory Experimenter\nwhich has been used in one of the modules; and both academic and technical staff in the\nDepartment of Psychology at Newcastle who have provided information, support,\nsuggestions and criticism.\nReferences\nChute, D.
