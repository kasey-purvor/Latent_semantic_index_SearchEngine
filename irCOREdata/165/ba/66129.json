INTRODUCTION\nThe interaction of thermodynamics with gravitation has\nbeen a subject of intense interest since the discovery of black\nhole entropy @1# and Hawking radiation @2#. The geometrical\nentropy associated with black hole horizons is thought to\nprovide an important clue to the quantum structure of space-\ntime, and many attempts have been made to parse the corre-\nsponding riddle. The approach most reminiscent of ordinary\nstatistical mechanics attempts to identify a collection of mi-\ncrostates whose counting reproduces this entropy. Despite\nsome successes, particularly in the context of string theory\n@3#, we are still far from having a concrete understanding of\nthese states in the regime where the classical geometrical\ndescription of a black hole is a good approximation to the\nunderlying physics ~and we do not aim to improve this situ-\nation in the present paper!.\nOther authors have tried to extend black hole entropy to\nmore general principles. In particular, the conjecture that the\nrelation between entropy and area extends to any event ho-\nrizon ~for example, to acceleration horizons in flat space! has\nbeen recently championed by Jacobson @4# and by Jacobson\nand Parentani @5# who studied the associated first law of\nthermodynamics.1 An interesting output of this line of rea-\nsoning is the suggestion @4# that horizon entropy arises be-\ncause gravity is thermodynamics ~or a special case thereof!.\nAdopting an alternative approach, a number of authors\n@7\u201310# have argued that the consistency of the second law of\nthermodynamics with a black hole entropy related to the area\nof the event horizon yields a general principle restricting the\nallowed entropy of any system, be it black hole, matter, or\nother.\nOur aim in this paper is to explore a new relation between\nhorizons and entropy, which we believe is relevant to the\ndiscussion above. We will show that the entropy associated\nwith a simple localized matter system in flat and otherwise\nempty space is not an invariant quantity defined by the sys-\ntem alone, but rather depends on which observer we ask to\nmeasure it. An inertial observer will assign the usual, naive\nentropy given by the logarithm of the number of internal\nstates. However, an accelerated observer ~who sees the ob-\nject immersed in a bath of thermal radiation! will find the\nobject to carry a different amount of entropy. Note that in the\ncontext we will consider both observers are able to describe\nthe object with the same degree of precision; the issue is not\nthat our object is partially hidden behind the Rindler horizon.\nIt is of course well known that the inertial and Rindler\nobservers already ascribe a different entropy to the\nMinkowski vacuum, as this is a thermal state with divergent\nentropy @11# from the Rindler point of view. Considering\nboth this fact and the background structures necessary for\nstandard discussions of thermodynamics, Wald has argued\nfor some time @12# ~see also the last part of @13#! that entropy\nis an extremely subtle concept in general relativity\u2014even for\nordinary matter systems\u2014and that we still lack the proper\nframework for a general discussion. Our results are in com-\nplete agreement with this philosophy and may be considered\na next small step in pursuit of this goal. In particular, we now\nlearn that the observer dependence of entropy is far more\nthan a simple shift of the zero point. What is perhaps surpris-\ning from the point of view of @12# is that the observers can\ndisagree on the entropy of a localized object even when they\nassign the same energy to all of its microstates.\nThe fact that an accelerated observer does not measure the\nusual naive entropy for an inertial matter system clearly has\nimportant consequences for thermodynamic discussions, and\n*Email address: marolf@physics.syr.edu\n\u2020Email address: dminic@vt.edu\n\u2021 Email address: S.F.Ross@durham.ac.uk\n1Other work with this theme includes @6# and references therein.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 69, 064006 ~2004!\n0556-2821\/2004\/69~6!\/064006~7!\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 064006-1\nour motivation for investigating these questions is closely\nrelated to recent explorations of such issues. Let us therefore\nrecall the recent progress @14,15# in clarifying issues related\nto the 2nd law as raised in @7\u201310#. To review the basic ques-\ntion, suppose one considers a black hole of temperature T\nand mass M. Classically, a mass M black hole will absorb\nany small object placed nearby.2 If an object ~obj! carries\nenergy Eob j into the black hole the associated increase in\nblack hole entropy will be dS5Eob j \/T by the first law. But\nwhat if the small object itself has more entropy Sob j than\nEob j \/T? Then such an absorption would violate the general-\nized 2nd law.\nBut let us also recall that @16# argues that the generalized\n2nd law will in general be satisfied when the system outside\nthe black hole can be described by quantum field theory in\ncurved spacetime. Though issues of divergences and back\nreaction prevent this from being a rigorous proof, it is at least\nhighly suggestive. If correct, then there are two logical alter-\nnatives. Either objects with Sob j.Eob j \/T cannot exist in any\nconsistent quantum field theory ~in curved spacetime!, or\nsome quantum effect must intervene to increase the entropy\nof the final state.\nThe latter conclusion was recently argued in @14,15#. The\nmain point was that for S.E\/T either ~i! thermally produced\nobjects macroscopically indistinguishable from that which\none is attempting to insert into the given black hole will play\nan important role in the thermal atmosphere of this black\nhole, or ~ii! the object of interest will be unable to freely\npenetrate this black hole\u2019s thermal atmosphere. There is a\nlarge overlap between the two cases; for example, the pres-\nence of similar objects in the thermal atmosphere can cause\nthe new object one introduces to experience a repulsive pres-\nsure. Such an effect might come either through an explicit\ninteraction or through statistical effects ~e.g., the Pauli exclu-\nsion principle!. This repulsive pressure can prohibit our ob-\nject from falling into the black hole.\nIn the case where our object can freely penetrate the ther-\nmal atmosphere, @15# suggested how quantum effects could\nstill alter the final state. The point is that, as mentioned\nabove, the thermal atmosphere must contain a significant\nnumber of such objects. This is argued @15# by computing the\nfree energy Fob j5Eob j2TSob j of such an object at the\nHawking temperature T and finding that Fob j is negative.\nSince the vacuum has zero free energy ~i.e., a greater\namount!, at temperature T our objects are more likely to exist\nthan not.\nSuppose now that the black hole were to come to equilib-\nrium ~say, if placed in a small reflecting cavity! with its\nthermal atmosphere. Such an equilibrium state would contain\na significant flux of objects directed toward the black hole.\nBut since there is equilibrium, it must be that similar objects\nare also radiated from the black hole at a significant rate.\nReference @15# argues that this will be the case even for large\nEob j \/T due to the fact that the entropy Sob j has been as-\nsumed even larger.\nThis effect appears to be sufficient to protect the second\nlaw when one drops a single Sob j.Eob j \/T object ~or a small\nnumber of such objects! into a black hole in otherwise empty\nspace. But there remains a final wrinkle to sort out: what if\nwe measure the flux of such objects being radiated from the\nblack hole and then arrange to beam our objects into the\nblack hole at a higher rate? Or, suppose we place the black\nhole in a reflecting cavity, let it reach equilibrium, and then\nsend in another object with more than eEob j \/T internal states?\nSince the density of such objects in equilibrium may al-\nready be high, this may require us to assume extremely weak\ninteractions. But this is not a problem in principle, and in the\npresent work we focus on the case of free fields. In the limit\nof a large black hole, the problem reduces to the study of a\nRindler horizon in flat spacetime. The equilibrium state is\njust the Minkowski vacuum which, however, appears ther-\nmally excited to uniformly accelerated ~i.e., Rindler! observ-\ners.\nHere, the observer dependence of entropy becomes cru-\ncial. We find that inertial and Rindler observers do not as-\ncribe the same amount of entropy to our object. Inertial ob-\nservers ascribe an entropy equal to the logarithm of the\nnumber of internal states, as expected. However, in the limit\nwhere the number of internal states n is large, a Rindler\nobserver ascribes only an entropy Sacc5Eacc \/T ,3 suggesting\nconsistency of the second law4 when such an object crosses\nthe event horizon. Thus, a consequence of our observer de-\npendence of entropy is that allowing an object to fall across\nan event horizon will plausibly respect the generalized sec-\nond law from the point of view of the accelerated observer\nwho remains outside of the horizon, no matter how many\ninternal states the object carries. However, our analysis stops\nshort of being a proof for reasons related to the unresolved\nissues with @16#; these are discussed further in the conclud-\ning section. ~The inertial observer, on the other hand, never\nloses sight of the object, so there can be no question of a\nviolation of the second law from their point of view.!\nWe will give a general argument for this observer depen-\ndence of the entropy in the next section. Our argument relies\nsimply on general points about thermodynamics and the re-\nlation of entropy to statistical ensembles. We will see that the\nRindler observer ascribes an entropy Sacc5Eacc \/T to the\nobject whenever it represents a small perturbation on the\nthermal state, which in particular will be true in the limit of\na large number of microstates. Section III then fleshes out the\ndetailed calculations in the case of free boson and free fer-\nmion fields. In particular, the relation between the Rindler\nenergy Eacc of the object and the inertially measured energy\nEinertial is calculated for a well-localized object. With the\nproper normalization of Eacc , and in the limit Einertial!T ,\n2Though classically such a black hole will have T50.\n3Here Eacc ~the energy measured by the accelerated observer! is\nthe Killing energy associated with the boost symmetry j ~i.e., the\nRindler time translation!. The associated temperature T is given by\nT5k\/2p where k is the surface gravity of j . As usual, the normal-\nization of j cancels so that Eacc \/T is independent of this choice.\n4Either the second law for black holes in the limit of a large black\nhole, or the \u2018\u2018stationary comparison\u2019\u2019 second law for asymptotic\nRindler horizons @5#.\nMAROLF, MINIC, AND ROSS PHYSICAL REVIEW D 69, 064006 ~2004!\n064006-2\none finds Eacc5Einertial as one would expect. However, for\nlarger T the answer can be rather different. We close with\nsome discussion in Sec. IV.\nII. ENTROPY AND OBSERVERS\nThe central point of this paper is to show that the entropy\nascribed to a localized physical system by different observers\ncan differ, even when both observers describe the region con-\ntaining the system with the same resolution. We exhibit this\nin a particularly simple context, considering the entropy of\nan object in flat space as seen by an inertial or a Rindler\nobserver. Note that we take the spacetime to be exactly flat\nand explicitly ignore any possible gravitational effects from\nthe objects we discuss. We will return to this point in Sec. IV.\nIn this section, we give a general argument suggesting that\nthe entropy measured by the Rindler observer will be\nbounded by Eacc \/T and strongly arguing for this result in the\nlimit of a large number of internal states. Here Eacc is the\nenergy associated to the object by the Rindler observer and T\ntemperature seen by this observer. In the following section,\nwe give some more detailed calculations for the case of\nsingle-particle excitations of free Bose or Fermi fields.\nFrom the inertial observer\u2019s point of view, the natural\nvacuum state is the Minkowski vacuum u0M&, and we de-\nscribe the excitation of this vacuum corresponding to the\npresence of some object ~in an undetermined microstate! by\nthe density matrix\nrM5\n1\nn (i51\nn\nu1M ;i&^1M ;iu, ~2.1!\nwhere the u1M ;i& denote Minkowski one-object states de-\nscribing the n possible microstates of our object. The entropy\nassigned to the object by the inertial observer is then as usual\nSM52Tr rMln rM5ln n . ~2.2!\nBut what entropy will a Rindler observer assign to this\nobject? Note that the answer is not given by 2Tr r ln r\nwhere r is the density matrix corresponding to rM from the\nRindler observer\u2019s point of view. This 2Tr r ln r would in-\nclude in addition a contribution from the background of ther-\nmal acceleration radiation that the Rindler observer may not\nwish to ascribe to the localized object. One way to define the\nentropy of the object from the Rindler observer\u2019s point of\nview is to ask what entropy is carried out of the visible\nRindler wedge when the object crosses the Rindler horizon.5\nThus, the appropriate Rindler notion of entropy Sacc carried\nby the object is the difference dS between the entropy in the\nvisible wedge when the object of interest is present and when\nit is not. Similarly Eacc5dE is the corresponding difference\nin Killing energies. We repeat that we work in the approxi-\nmation where gravitational back reaction is neglected and, in\nparticular, in which the horizon is unchanged by the passage\nof our object.\nWe therefore first consider the thermal density matrix rR0\nwhich results from tracing the Minkowski vacuum,\nu0M&^0Mu, over the invisible Rindler wedge:\nrR05Trinvisibleu0M&^0Mu. ~2.3!\nThis describes all information that the Rindler observer can\naccess in the Minkowski vacuum state. We wish to compare\nrR0 with another density matrix rR1 which provides the Rin-\ndler description of the state rM above, in which one object\n~in an undetermined microstate! is added to the Minkowski\nvacuum u0M&. The density matrix rR1 is hence\nrR15TrinvisiblerM5Trinvisible\n1\nn (i51\nn\nu1M ;i&^1M ;iu.\n~2.4!\nWe would like to compute the difference in energy\ndE5Tr@H~rR12rR0!# , ~2.5!\nand entropy\ndS52Tr@rR1ln rR12rR0ln rR0# , ~2.6!\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian of the system and, in both cases,\nthe sign has been chosen so that the change is positive when\nrR1 has the greater value of energy or entropy. The entropy\nof each state separately is well known to be divergent @11#.\nHowever, there is no reason to expect dS to be ill-defined in\nour context. Assuming that the object has some moderately\nwell-defined inertially-measured energy Einertial and is well\nlocalized, the energy measured by the Rindler observer will\nalso be reasonably well-defined and the difference\nrR1ln rR12rR0ln rR0 will have negligibly small diagonal en-\ntries at high energy so that the above trace will exist. In other\nwords, we may compute dS by first imposing a cutoff L ,\ncomputing the entropy (S0 ,S1) and energy (E0 ,E1) of the\ntwo states (rR0 ,rR1) separately, subtracting the results, and\nremoving the cutoff. We will see that the cutoff dependence\nis trivial in the approximation used below.\nLet us make the simplifying assumption that the object\nrepresents a small perturbation on the initial thermal Rindler\ndensity matrix rR0; that is, rR15rR01dr , where \u2018\u2018dr\n!rR0.\u2019\u2019 One expects this approximation to hold for ne2E\/T\n@1, in which case ~on average! there are already many ob-\njects similar to ours present in rR0. In particular, this ap-\nproximation should hold in the limit of large n with fixed\nE\/T . A somewhat more careful argument for this approxima-\ntion was explained to us by Mark Srednicki and is given in\nthe Appendix.\nWe therefore approximate dS by Taylor expanding around\nrR0,\n5The terms \u2018\u2018visible\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018invisible\u2019\u2019 Rindler wedge will always\nbe used in the context of what is in causal contact with our chosen\nRindler observer. Of course, the entire spacetime is visible to the\ninertial observer.\nNOTES ON SPACETIME THERMODYNAMICS AND THE . . .

This key result is\nindependent of any cutoff.\nThis result can also be understood on the basis of classical\nthermodynamic reasoning. The initial configuration rR0 rep-\nresents a thermal equilibrium. We wish to calculate the\nchange in entropy in a process which increases the energy by\nan amount dE . Whatever the nature of the object that we\nadd, this cannot increase the entropy by more than it would\nhave increased had we added this energy as heat. Since we\nconsider a small change in the configuration, the first law\nyields\ndS,dSmax5\ndE\nT . ~2.9!\nWe see that the process of adding a small object saturates\nthis bound, at least to first order in small quantities. We\nshould expect that if we relaxed the assumption that the ob-\nject represents a small change in the configuration, the result-\ning dS will satisfy but no longer saturate the integrated ver-\nsion of this bound.\nWe have found that the entropies ascribed to the localized\nobject by Minkowski and Rindler observers behave in quite\ndifferent ways. From the point of view of the Minkowski\nobserver, entropy and energy are independent; the object can\nhave an arbitrarily large entropy with fixed energy if it has\nsufficiently many internal states. On the other hand, from the\npoint of view of the Rindler observer, entropy and energy are\nlinked in a very general way by the bound ~2.9!. As we will\nsee in the examples in the next section, the Rindler entropy\nfor \u2018\u2018highly entropic objects\u2019\u2019 will be much smaller than the\ninertial entropy.\nNote that since it arises from a trace over the invisible\nRindler wedge, this restriction is generally correlated with\nthe presence of a horizon, to which we might want to assign\na geometric entropy. Thus, this reduction in the ascribed en-\ntropy is important for a complete understanding of attempts\nto violate the generalized second law using such highly en-\ntropic objects, as reviewed in the Introduction. We will return\nto such issues in Sec. IV.\nIII. CALCULATIONS FOR FREE FIELDS\nWe now explore two concrete examples to illustrate and\nelucidate the general discussion above. We consider a system\nof n free Bose or Fermi fields, and calculate the entropy of\nobjects described, from the inertial point of view, by a single-\nparticle density matrix uniformly distributed over the differ-\nent fields. Thus the inertial observer assigns the object an\nentropy Sinertial5ln n in each case.\nA. Bosons\nFor a system of n free bosonic fields, the Minkowski\nvacuum can be recast in terms of the Rindler data as the\nfollowing entangled state @17#:\nu0M&5)\ni51\nn\n)j ~12e\n2v j \/T!1\/2e2(v j\/2T)ai jL\n\u2020\nai jR\n\u2020\nu0Rindler& .\n~3.1!\nHere i labels the different fields, j labels a complete set of\nmodes u jL ,u jR of positive Rindler frequency v j for each\nfield, and the labels R and L refer respectively to the right\nand left Rindler wedges. Each mode uiL ,u jR of the ith field\nhas an associated annihilation operator aiL ,aiR which anni-\nhilates the Rindler vacuum u0Rindler& and satisfies a standard\ncommutation relation of the form aa\u20202a\u2020a51. The tem-\nperature T associated with the uniformly accelerating ob-\nserver of interest is given by T5a\/2p5k\/2p where a is the\nobserver\u2019s proper acceleration and k is the surface gravity of\nthe boost Killing field j that is normalized on our observer\u2019s\nworld line.\nSimilarly, the annihilation operator aiM for a Minkowski\nmode uM of the ith field can on general principles @17# be\nexpressed in the form\naiM5(j @~uM ,u jR!~ai jR2e\n2v j\/2Tai jL\n\u2020 !\n1~uM ,u jL!~ai jL2e\n2v j\/2Tai jR\n\u2020 !# , ~3.2!\nwhere (u ,v) is the Klein-Gordon inner product. For simplic-\nity we might suppose that we choose a mode uM with no\nsupport on the invisible Rindler wedge ~say, the left one! and\nfor which (uM ,u jR) is well modeled by a delta function; we\nwill return to the general case later in the subsection. In\nparticular, this simplification means that the Rindler fre-\nquency v of uM is reasonably well defined.6 For such a case\nthe above Bogoliubov transformation becomes\naiM5\n1\nA12e2v\/T\n~aiR2e\n2v\/2TaiL\n\u2020 !, ~3.3!\nwhere the normalization of aiM is fixed by the commutation\nrelation.

The superscript\ndiag indicates that we have written only the diagonal part of\nrR1 in the standard basis, which the reader will shortly see is\nall that contributes to dE and dS below. One can check\nexplicitly that rR1 is properly normalized so that its trace is\n1.\nThe change in the density matrix is thus dr5rR12rR0.\nAs in the previous section, we assume that this change is\nsmall, so that we can compute the change in entropy by dS\n52Tr\u0084dr(11ln r)\u0085. For noninteracting particles, the\nHamiltonian is H5( iNiv , so the average change in energy\nis\ndE5v TrS (\ni\nNidr D 5 v12e2v\/T . ~3.7!\nThis result is already of interest. Note that for v@T and\nunder the conditions of footnote 6, one finds dE5Einertial\n\u2019v . On the other hand, for v!T the background of objects\nin the thermal bath leads to an amplification reminiscent of\nthe effect of stimulated emission.7\nOn the other hand, the change in entropy is\ndS52Tr@dr~11ln rR0!#\n52TrFdrS 11C2 vNT D G5 dET , ~3.8!\nwhere in the second step we used that rR0 is thermal ~i.e.,\nrR05Ce2H\/T, where C is a c-number!; and in the final step\nwe use Tr dr50. It is clear that Eqs. ~3.7! and ~3.8! depend\nonly on the diagonal part of rR1 since the other factors in the\ntrace are all diagonal.\nThis expression obviously saturates the bound provided\nby the second law of thermodynamics in agreement with the\ngeneral arguments of Sec. II. The results are independent of\nthe number of species n due to the fact that both dE and dS\nare linear in dr , while dr is a normalized average over\nterms in which each field is changed independently. Thus for\nlarge n the Rindler observer will ascribe a much smaller\nentropy to the object.\nFinally, let us return to the case where more than one pair\nof Rindler modes contributes to Eq. ~3.2!. Since rM is qua-\ndratic in aiM , this leads to two sums over Rindler operators\nin Eq. ~3.5!. However, since Ni and (11ln rR0) are diagonal\nin the standard Rindler Fock basis, inspection of Eqs. ~3.7!\nand ~3.8! shows that only the corresponding diagonal part of\nrM will contribute to dE and dS . This diagonal part contains\nonly a single sum over modes, weighted by u(uM ,u jR)u2 or\nu(uM ,u jL)u2. In the case where the Minkowski mode has no\nsupport in the left wedge ~so that u(uM ,u jL)u250!, the effect\nis just as if each mode represented a separate field. But we\nhave seen that the final result is independent of the number\nof fields and, by the same logic, it is independent of the\nweighting given to the various fields in Eq. ~3.5!, so long as\nrM is properly normalized. Thus we again obtain Eqs. ~3.7!\nand ~3.8!. In fact, it is clear that spreading the support over\nmany modes only helps to justify our approximation as it\nincreases the effective number of fields. In the more general\ncase where the Minkowski mode function overlaps the invis-\nible wedge, the quantities dE and dS will be reduced in\nproportion to the probability that the object lies in the invis-\nible wedge but one again finds dS5dE\/T .\nB.

DISCUSSION\nWe have argued that inertial and accelerated observers\nnaturally ascribe different values to the entropy of a localized\nmatter system in flat Minkowski space, even if the system is\nfully visible to both observers and the observers describe the\nsystem with the same resolution. Certainly, the observers\nmeasure a different dS when the localized system is intro-\nduced or removed, and so must use different values when\nconsidering a thermodynamic accounting of such processes.\nThe results support the suggestions of @12# that entropy, even\nof ordinary matter systems, is a very subtle concept in gen-\neral relativity or quantum field theory in curved spacetime.\nWhat is surprising from the point of view of @12# is that\nour effect occurs even when the observers agree on the en-\nergy of each microstate. Our effect is in some sense due to a\n\u2018\u2018mixing\u2019\u2019 between the object considered and the thermal\nbackground seen by the Rindler observer. In particular, we\nargued that when the number of microstates n satisfies\nne2E\/T@1 the entropy assigned to our object by the accel-\nerated observer is dS5dE\/T . Note that in this regime a\nthermal ensemble of distinguishable particles would diverge,\nas each new particle would add an entropy ln n@E\/T. Thus,\nstatistics plays an important role and one cannot rely on any\nintuition built from the study of distinguishable particles.\nThe above sections provided general arguments as well as\nexplicit calculations for free fields. It is clear that the general\narguments apply equally well to static observers in the pres-\nence of a black hole or a cosmological ~e.g., de Sitter! hori-\nzon, and that the free field calculations would take a form\nthat is essentially identical. Our general arguments are quite\nsimilar to those of @16#, and our observer dependence of\nentropy provides an important physical mechanism behind\nsuch arguments. We note that the theorem derived in @16#\napplies rigorously in the context considered here in which\nthe temperature and the location of the horizon are held con-\nstant and the dependence on any cutoff is trivial.\nIn the black hole case, the result dS5dE\/T would apply\nto any static observer and would in general differ from the\nentropy assigned by a freely falling observer. It is therefore\ninteresting to return to the discussion of attempts to violate\nthe generalized second law ~i.e., including horizon entropy!\nby dropping an object with n@eE\/T microstates into a black\nhole. Suppose first that the object begins far away and that\nwe work in asymptotically flat space. Then the object will\nbegin in a region of space that is not in thermal equilibrium\nwith the black hole and where the effective local temperature\nvanishes. Here a static observer measures the object to have\nentropy ln n since there is no thermal bath. On the other\nhand, as the object approaches the black hole horizon one\nexpects that it enters a region which is ~nearly! at thermal\nequilibrium at the black hole temperature T as described by\nthe distant static observer. If the object acts like a free field,8\nwe have seen that at this point the static observer can ascribe\nonly an entropy S5E\/T to the object. Thus if nothing else\noccurs the second law will indeed have been violated. The\nimportant point, however, is that this will occur before the\nobject reaches the horizon itself. Thus, one expects that the\ngeneralized second law is protected by the same mechanism\nthat protects the ordinary second law. In the present case, one\nexpects to see a large flux of objects radiated by the black\nhole as, inverting the above argument, movement of highly\nentropic objects from the warm near-horizon neighborhood\ninto the cold region of space will dramatically increase the\nentropy.\nThe effect is similar to attempting to send a low frequency\nphoton ~with two internal states! into a hot cavity which is\notherwise at equilibrium\u2014many more photons will emerge.\nSending in a larger flux of photons does not help as a beam\nwith N photons does not in general have entropy N ln 2 un-\nless the photons are well separated, but well-separated pho-\ntons will never overpower the large outward flux. This latter\neffect is also important for AdS black holes which can be at\nequilibrium with the entire spacetime.\nAs with @16#, this result suggests that the generalized sec-\nond law holds whenever the region outside the black hole is\ndescribed by standard quantum field theory, regardless of\nwhether one imposes bounds of the forms suggested in\n@7\u201310#. However, both stop short of being proofs because\n8And thus falls freely so that the energy is constant in the test\nobject approximation.\nMAROLF, MINIC, AND ROSS PHYSICAL REVIEW D 69, 064006 ~2004!\n064006-6\nthey do not trace the actual dynamical changes as an object\nfalls through the horizon. The absorption of the object by the\nblack hole will change both the temperature and the size of\nthe horizon. Since a change of the horizon size in some sense\nimplies a change in the \u2018\u2018location\u2019\u2019 of the horizon, any proof\nbuilt without a detailed theory of quantum gravity would\nlikely require careful assumptions as to the treatment of\nmodes near the horizon which, by themselves, lead to a di-\nvergence in the total entropy 2Tr r ln r of the thermal bath\nseen by the accelerated observer @11#. For a finite ~as op-\nposed to infinitesimal! process, careful consideration would\nneed to be given to nonequilibrium issues.

This can be argued through a standard trick\nfrom statistical mechanics.9 One notes that the entropy\nS52Tr(r ln r) is 21 times the order e term in the expan-\nsion of Tr r11e5Tr ree ln r.\nLet us now compute the entropy of rR1. We note that this\ndensity matrix is an average of n terms, each identical to rR0\nexcept that the density matrix describing a certain subsystem\nhas been changed. The average is over the label telling us\nwhich subsystem has been changed. Thus, if rR0 takes the\nform rR05 ^ i51\nn A , then we may write\nrR15\n1\nn (i A ^ \u0095\u0095\u0095^ A ^ B ^ A ^ \u0095\u0095\u0095^ A ~A1!\nwhere again the index i tells us where to place the factor B.\nIt is straightforward to see that for integer k!n we have\nTr rR15@Tr~Ak21B !#k@Tr~Ak!#n2k1O~1\/n !, ~A2!\nsince the number of terms having more than one factor of B\nin the same subsystem are O(1\/n).
