Introduction \n \nIn the last few decades, Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have deeply affected the \nway business is performed and the way that organisations compete (Porter, 1985, 2001; Porter \nand Millar,1985). The tourism and travel industries were particularly affected by these \ndevelopments and in particular the way organisations distributed their tourism products in the \nmarketplace (Poon,1993; Buhalis, Tjoa, Jafari,1998; Buhalis, Schertler,1999; Fesenmaier, Klein, \nBuhalis, D. 2000; Sheldon, W\u00f6ber, Fesenmaier, 2001). Traditionally the travel distribution role has \nbeen performed by outbound travel agencies (OTAs), tour operators (TOs) and inbound travel \nagents or handling agencies (ITAs) (Buhalis and Laws, 2001). They were supported by Computer \nReservation Systems (CRSs), Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) or tour operators\u2019 Videotext \nsystems (Leisure Travel Networks) (Karcher,1997,1998; Bordat,1999). In addition, tour operators \nused teletext to display late deals and special offers directly to consumers\u2019 TV. These traditional \nelectronic intermediaries (or \u2018eMediaries\u2019), particularly GDSs, progressively consolidated their \nposition to four major systems, namely SABRE, AMADEUS, GALILEO, WORLDSPAN (K\u00e4rcher,1996; \nFrench, 1998; Copeland, 1991; Copeland and McKenney,1988; Truitt, Teye and Farris, 1991; \nArchdale, 1996; Sheldon, 1997; Hawkins, Leventhal, & Oden, 1996; WTO,1995). This was due to \ntheir predominance as the largest existing repositories of travel stock information, with backing \nfrom the travel suppliers that had created and funded them. This illustrated in Figure 1, where \nLeiper\u2019s (1985) tourism system is used to explain the ICT supported distribution channel. The \nfigure demonstrates that the tourism system is composed by the place of consumers\u2019 origin and \nthe destination, with a number of tourism firms offering their services. In the transit region there \nare transportation companies and traditional intermediaries supported by GDSs, Teletext and \nViewdata.  \n \nHowever, the Internet and electronic Commerce (eCommerce) developments in the late 1990s and \nthe adoption of Tourism as one of the prime B2B (Business to Business) and B2C (Business to \nConsumers) application has changed the situation rapidly (Buhalis,1998; O\u2019Connor,1999; Smith \nand Jenner,1998). The development of advent of the Internet as a universal and interactive means \nof communication, and a parallel change in consumer behaviour and attitude, have therefore \nshifted the traditional way tourism and travel products are distributed (Werthner and Klein,1999; \nO\u2019Connor and Frew,2000). Increasingly, consumers can undertake their entire tourism product \nsearch and booking on-line and therefore the role of eMediaries has been changing dramatically.  \n \nThe Internet is widely used as a means to deliver up-to-date content. As a result it created the \nconditions for the emergence of a wide range of new tourism eMediaries. The proliferation of \neMediaries followed a period of euphoria when a great member of players hoped that they will \ngenerate a high volume of profit by targeting the tourism industry. Tourism suppliers (particularly \nairlines, car rental and hotels chains) took advantage of the new opportunities and developed \neCommerce applications by allowing users to access directly their reservation systems. This \nincluded single supplier provisions, such as British Airways (www.britishairways.com), Marriott \nHotels (www.marriott.com), Avis (www.avis.com) as well as multi-supplier web pages that \nemerged to support airlines disintermediating travel agencies (e.g. www.opodo.com, \nwww.orbitz.com). In addition, several destinations developed Destination Management Systems \n(DMSs) to distribute their smaller properties and to present the destination as a holistic entity (eg \nwww.tiscover.com, www.holland.com). A number of web-based travel agencies also emerged (e.g. \nExpedia.com, ebookers.com, Travelocity.com) whilst off-line agencies developed their on-line \nprovision (e.g. www.thomascook.com, www.lunnpoly.com). Internet portals (e.g. Yahoo, Altavista, \nExcite) and vertical portals (or vortals) (e.g. www.ski.com, www.golfonline.com, www.tennis.com) \nalso developed on-line travel distribution, often by sourcing their travel content from external \nonline agents and suppliers. Media companies such as newspapers (travel.telegraph.co.uk) and \ntelevision networks (www.cnn.com\/travel) gradually integrated their off-line with their on-line \nprovision and expanded to include eCommerce capabilities on their sites. On-line last minute \nagencies emerged to enable distressed inventory to be distributed efficiently (e.g. \nwww.lastminute.com). Priceline.com reversed the pricing method and allowed passengers to \nsearch for suppliers that would be prepared to serve them for the amount of money that \nconsumers specified. Finally, a number of sites (e.g. www.QXL.com, www.ebay.com) specialised in \nthe sale of distress stock through auctions. The proliferation of eMediaries confused consumers \nand the industry as many marketing managers rushed to ensure that their products were \nrepresented in all distribution channels and realised the difficulty and cost of doing so. \n \nMost of these emerging eMediaries are new entrants often owned or powered by existing non-\ntourism organisations (e.g. Microsoft\u2019s Expedia). The major GDSs, following a period of inertia \nrealised the dramatic changes, are gradually entering the online market by developing interfaces \nfor consumers [e.g. Travelocity.com (owned by Sabre) and TRIP.com (owned by Galileo)], \nFigure 1: Old eTourism Intermediaries\nTransit Region\nTransportation\nTourism\nDestination\nRegion\nD\nM\nO\nF\ni\nr\nm\ns\nOrigin \nRegion\nOTA TO\nITO\nIntermediariesCo\nn\ns\nu\nm\ne\nr\ns\nGDS\nViedata\nTeletext\nalthough they are still less proactive than newer players (O'Connor, 1999; Buhalis, 1998,2000; \nRicher & O\u2019Neill-Dunne, 1999). In addition to the above Internet-based new eMediaries, there is a \ngradual emergence of further new eMediaries using mobile devices (mobile phones, palm tops etc \nas well as vehicle fitted devices) and interactive digital television. A framework identifying a \nnumber of new eMediaries based on the three emerging ePlatforms (Internet, mobile devices and \nIDTV) is demonstrated in Figure 2. Table 1 also demonstrates examples of traditional and new \neMediaries. \n \nAdvanced communication technologies the gradual commercialisation of IDTV (IDTV) and the \ngrowing availability of tourism products and services on mobile networks (mCommerce) will \nintensify competition further. Therefore, traditional eMediaries should re-assess the way they \nconduct business to ensure that they remain competitive and benefit from the emergent \nopportunities. Using innovative interfaces, traditionally eMediaries will be able to distribute their \nproducts to wider audiences and to enhance their position. This will be increasingly critical in a \nmarket that is focusing towards direct marketing and cost\/commission cuttings. However the ICT \ndevelopments will create major problems for organisations that fail to adopt and modernise, as \nnew eMediaries will be competing to maximise their market share by adding value and benefits for \nboth business and leisure end-users. This exploratory research aims to identify the future of both \nnew and traditional eMediaries, and the evolution of their business models as a result of the ICT \ndevelopments. The research also elaborates on the expected future of traditional and new \neMediaries and demonstrates the expected winners and losers in the tourism distribution channel. \n \nFigure 2: New eTourism Intermediaries\nTransit Region\nTransportation\nTourism\nDestination\nRegion\nD\nM\nO\nF\ni\nr\nm\ns\nOrigin \nRegion\nOTA TO ITO\nIntermediaries\nC\no\nn\ns\nu\nm\ne\nr\ns\nGDS\nViedata\nInternet\n Hotels and Airlines\neTravel Agencies\nSwitch companies\nDestination Systems\nLifestylers\nPortals and Vortals\nTeletext.com\nMedia eg CNN\nNewspapers\nmCommerceIDTV\nTeletext\nTable 1 Traditional eTourism Intermediaries vs. New eTourism Intermediaries \nTraditional \neTourism \neMediaries \nNew  \neTourism \neMediaries \nGDSs  \n Sabre, \n Amadeus, \n Galileo, \n Worldspan \nViewdata \nTeletext \nPrincipals \n Airlines \n www.flybmi.com \n www.airfrance.com \n www.opodo.com \n www.orbitz.com \n Hotels \n www.marriott.com \n www.oscar.gr \nDestinations \n www.tiscover.at \n www.holland.com \nSwitch companies \n www.utell.com \nTravel Agencies  \n www.lunnpoly.com \n www.expedia.com  \n www.travelocity.com \nLastminute Bookings \n www.lastminute.com \nPortals \n www.yahoo.com \n www.lycos.com \nVortals  \n www.tennis.com \n www.Igolf.com \nNewspapers \n Travel.telegraph.co.uk \nNews Media \n cnn.com \nAuction sites \n www.qxl.com \n www.ebay.com \n2. Methodology \n \nAs this is an exploratory research, a qualitative approach was adopted to enable the researchers to \nappreciate all aspects of the subject and to develop a set of critical variables. Extensive secondary \nresearch was used to revise the theoretical framework and also to identify critical areas deserving \nfurther investigation. Primary research included both qualitative and quantitative methods. As this \nis one of the most dynamic areas of both tourism and eCommerce, it was decided to concentrate \nthe primary research only on expert opinion as this would have enabled the identification of long-\nterm trends and provide the research with up-to-today and fairly unbiased evidence. All research \nactivity was undertaken in the UK. \n \nThe survey was conducted in three phases, using three primary research tools: an unstructured \ninterview-discussion, a questionnaire and an interview structure. Qualitative interviews with a small \nnumber of experts (mainly academics and consultants) helped to obtain more in-depth information \nand clarify points of debate. These experts were identified by their contribution to the literature \nand also their active participation in international tourism and IT conferences. An unstructured \ndiscussion enabled the researchers to interact with participants and to identify critical issues. \nBased on this activity a questionnaire was drafted, including a number of variables to record \nexperts views and beliefs. The questionnaire contained 14 questions, selected based on the \nbackground study, the secondary research and pilot interviews with a select number of experts. \n \nThe quantitative survey, allowed to quantify, relate and justify opinions and attitudes of a greater \nnumber of people. The questionnaire was e-mailed twice over the period of one month to a total \nof 62 experts and a total of 30 questionnaires were completed (response rate 49 percent). Quota \nand judgmental sampling methodologies were used to obtain a pool of possible expert \nrespondents. Experts were chosen as experts on their field and included participants from most \ntourism industry sectors, such as airlines, hotels, travel agencies, tour operators, as well as \nconsultants and leading academics in the area. The vast majority of the respondents work in the \nUK, although a few operate overseas. Questionnaire respondents were asked to indicate the level \nof agreement to particular statements. Given the exploratory nature of this research and the \nlimited number of experts on the field, the number of questionnaires and interviews was assessed \nas satisfactory.  \n \nFollowing the analysis of the unstructured interviews and questionnaires a further round of \nqualitative research was undertaken, mainly to qualify, support and appreciate the findings of the \nquantitative research. This research constituted by a set of follow-up telephone interviews with \nindustry experts, through which more in-depth opinions and comments on the subject were \nobtained. A standardised but open-ended approach to questioning was used. Certain areas were \nexplored in greater depth, through probing questions not originally included in the interview \nschedule. Notes were kept on all additional questions asked. Interviews were tape recorded and \ntapes were listened to at the analysis stage for further input. The interviewees\u2019 answers were not \ninfluenced by the interviewer\u2019s comments. Twenty people were contacted for telephone interviews \nof which 10 people were interviewed. This sample contained a well-proportioned cross-section of \nbusiness types: systems suppliers (3), online travel agents (2), a product supplier, a consultancy \nand GDSs\/Leisure Travel Networks (3). The interviews lasted between 30 minutes and 1 hour. \n \nThe adopted research methodology offered a great depth of knowledge on the research area and \nenabled the researchers not only to quantify a number of trends, as perceived by experts, but also \nto collect a great wealth of qualitative and exploratory information. \n \n3 Effectiveness of Modern eTourism platforms \n \nIt was considered vital to the purpose of this research to determine the advantages and \ndisadvantages of the emerging ePlatforms used by the new eMediaries, namely the Internet, m-\nCommerce and Interactive Digital TV, in order to produce a more meaningful comparison with \ntraditional distribution channels.  \n \n3.1 Internet Distribution \nSimilarly to Sheldon (1997) and Buhalis (1998), most respondents felt that the Internet gives \naccess to a great number of people, as well as offers the opportunity to develop closer \nrelationships with customers. Respondents felt that the Internet enables consumers to \ncommunicate with organisations on a 24 hours, 365 days a year basis and also it enables \norganisations to implement Customer Relationship Management programs enhancing the \nopportunities for interaction and a better understanding of both sides. This interaction generates a \nwhole range of new requirements for organisations, as they need to be accessible and available \nconstantly. Hence, calling centres and interactive teams have been developed by a wide range of \norganisations to support their Internet distribution. Although this is expensive to develop and \nmaintain, tourism organisations have reduced their distribution costs and overhead costs. This is \nbecause they can afford to pay less commission (or no commission in some airlines\u2019 case) to \nintermediaries and at the same time consumers do the manual work of data entry, instead of \nemployees of the company. The Internet was therefore identified as a clear beneficial distribution \nplatform for principals (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2 Advantages of Internet distribution for travel companies \n 1 \nStrongly \ndisagree\n2\nDisagree\n3\nNeutral\n4\nAgree \n5\nStrongly \nagree \nNo reply # of valid\nreplies \nMean STD \nGreater flexibility \nand convenience\n1\n3.3% \n7\n23.3% \n7\n23.3% \n15 \n50% \n 30 4.20 0.91 \nIncreased \npenetration and \nreach of \ncustomer base \n 1 \n3.3% \n5\n16.6% \n13 \n43.3% \n11 \n36.6% \n 30 4.13 0.81 \nLower \ndistribution costs\n3\n10% \n4\n13.3% \n13 \n43.3% \n10 \n33.3% \n 30 4.00 0.93 \nIncreased \ncustomer \ninteraction \n 2 \n6.6% \n7\n23.3% \n14 \n46.6% \n7\n23.3% \n 30 3.87 0.85 \nEasier to Identify \nand Target \nCustomer Base \n 2 \n6.6% \n9\n30% \n11 \n36.6% \n8\n26.6% \n 30 3.83 0.90 \nGlobalisation of \nproduct \n 2 \n6.6% \n12 \n40% \n7\n23.3% \n9\n30% \n 30 3.77 0.96 \nUse of \nMultimedia \n1\n3.3% \n6\n20% \n9\n30% \n4\n13.3% \n9\n30% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.48 1.22 \nThe Internet also enables principals to identify and target customers more accurately and \neffectively. A wide range of segmentation questions are often asked in the profiling of consumers \nand specific market segments are frequently diverted to specialised parts of the Internet provision. \nRespondents representing tour operators and leisure travel networks rated the globalisation of the \nselling process of the travel product highly. This may be explained by their increasing need to \nmass-customise their products. Transcending geographical borders allows them to penetrate \nforeign markets and to embrace a much wider consumer pool towards expanding their market \nshare. Respondents rated the \u2018use of multimedia\u2019 as the least important advantage of the Internet. \nThis can be explained by the current bandwidth restrictions, which do not allow the potential for \nmultimedia content diffusion to be fully realised by industry. However, qualitative research \ndemonstrated that great potential exists for the utilisation of multimedia to convey graphic \ninformation and animation about tourism products. This can include videos, maps, interactive \npresentations etc. Therefore, respondents anticipated that once the technical problems are \nresolved, tourism organisation would be able to take advantage of the enormous opportunities \nemerging through multimedia. Broad bandwidth and the Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line \n(ADSL) technology will be critical for allowing the transmission of digital information at high \nbandwidths on existing phone lines for supporting Internet users at home.  \n \nAs the respondents were tourism and technology professionals, they were expected to advocate \nICTs and to find few disadvantages on the Internet. Naturally therefore most respondents \ndisagreed with most of the Internet distribution disadvantages (Table 3). The greatest number of \npositive answers was for \u2018Lack of human contact during the interaction\u2019 and \u2018Lack of face-to-face \nup-sell\/cross-sell opportunities\u2019. Respondents felt that since on-line users do not have physical \ncontacts with the actual seller, it is more difficult for the seller to instigate further sales, or to lead \nthe customer to the purchase more expensive or additional products. However, evidence from \nScandinavian countries demonstrates that the Internet is more successful in cross-selling as \nconsumers can experiment add extra elements out of their own initiative and enquire on-line \nwithout being embarrassed to ask questions. Some interviewees also mentioned that actually the \nInternet is offering a better service and experience for the consumer as their interaction with \ntourism organisations can be more meaningful. Instead of meeting an inexperienced travel \nconsultant in the high street shop, after having struggled to park and waited in the queue for their \nturn, a number of travel companies already offer specialised support through their calling centres \nand enable consumers to ask specific questions to a product\/property\/destination specialist. \n \nTable 3 \u2013 Disadvantages of Internet distribution for travel companies \n1 Strongly \ndisagree \n2\nDisa- \nGree \n3 Neutral 4\nAgree\n5 Strongly\nagree \n# of \nvalid \nreplies \nMean Standard \nDeviation\nLack of human contact \nduring the transaction \n2\n6.6% \n8\n26.6% \n8\n26.6% \n10 \n33.3%\n2\n6.6% \n30 3.07 1.06 \nLack of face-to-face up-\nsell\/cross-sell \nopportunities \n7\n23.3% \n3\n10% \n8\n26.6% \n10 \n33.3%\n2\n6.6% \n30 2.90 1.27 \nVolatile customer base 7 \n23.3% \n10 \n33.3% \n5\n16.6% \n6\n20% \n2\n6.6% \n30 2.53 1.23 \nSecurity issues 6 \n20% \n10 \n33.3% \n10 \n33.3% \n4\n13.3%\n30 2.40 0.95 \nDanger of standard rather \nthan tailor-made products\n9\n30% \n7\n23.3% \n8\n26.6% \n5\n16.6%\n1\n3.3% \n30 2.40 1.17 \nAlienation of potential \ncustomers \n4\n13.3% \n16 \n53.3% \n10 \n33.3% \n 30 2.20 0.65 \nDifficult to market \neffectively \n14 \n46.6% \n6\n20% \n9\n30% \n1\n3.3% \n 30 1.90 0.94 \nDifficulty of keeping \nrecords up-to-date \n13 \n43.3% \n9\n30% \n7\n23.3% \n1\n3.3% \n 30 1.87 0.88 \nThe volatile customer base was often perceived as an opportunity, as experts claimed that \norganisations can expand their offering to new segments and geographical regions. Security issues \nwere still perceived as significant, but interviews suggested that increasingly consumers who use \non-line services appreciate the benefits and realise eCommerce is more secure than many other \nforms of purchasing. The alienation of potential customers was not perceived as a major problem. \nOff-line companies, such as Thomas Cook, only enhance their provision for their customers who \nwould like to go on-line, whilst their traditional markets are being maintained. On-line companies \nsuch as expedia.com had no off-line customers to alienate and therefore interviewees felt that was \nnot a problem.  \n \nThe technical capabilities of the competitive tourism organisations improve rapidly. Therefore the \nupdating and maintenance of databases is not seen as a major problem. More advanced and \nreliable technologies and database packages reduce the need for human operator intervention and \nallow greater precision in the quality of data. This has been achieved through the automation of \nproduct information updating processes and the use of \u2018intelligent\u2019 web forms, where user-entered \ndata can automatically be inserted in databases. In addition, the employment of ICT expects \ngradually reduces technical problems of this nature and supports organisations to concentrate on \ntheir business. Interviewees therefore felt strongly that there was no danger of \u201cstandard rather \nthan tailor-made products\u201d, \u201cdifficulty to market effectively\u201d and \u201cdifficulty of keeping records up-\nto-date\u201d. Instead they felt that the Internet offers more opportunities for differentiation, for \nmarket, products and services development and for taking advantage of records through data-\nwarehousing and data-mining for dynamic marketing. \n \n3.2 Interactive Digital Television Distribution (IDTV) \n \nInterviewees appreciated that although the technical capability for IDTV is already available, there \nare limited commercial applications hitherto. They clearly felt, however, that a new wave of \ntechnology will emerge within the next two years and that will have profound effects for the \ntourism industry. They anticipated that IDTV will revolutionise the travel distribution channel, as it \nwill enable easier access and will increase the number of users dramatically. The majority of \nrespondents agreed that IDTV is a \u2018Wide reaching, populist channel\u2019. Most households already \npossess a TV set, it is widely used and people have an affiliation with it. They frequently trust their \nfavourite TV channels for their information, news and political debate. IDTV will require a set-top \nbox, which in most cases can be obtained free with the subscription to a digital broadcaster\u2019s \nservices (Table 4). Thus, IDTV will be accessible to a greater portion of the population than the \nInternet and it will allow a greater penetration to the home market as well as to a greater age \nspectrum. Respondents also agreed that IDTV will probably inspire greater confidence to the on-\nline-buyer, as transactions could be perceived to be safer than they would be on the Internet.  \n \nInterviewees mentioned that IDTV based tourism distribution benefits from several factors:  \n \no It is a richer communication medium, offering multimedia presentations, video on \ndemand and more realistic footage of destinations and tourism facilities. \no It enables a more relaxed atmosphere than when using the Internet.  \no It is interactive and allows video on demand, with full motion pictures and sound. \no It presents content to the family\/group rather than simply to the individual and \ntherefore it will be more targeted to the home than the business market.  \no It does not need to be switched-on through a procedure. \no It is easy to use and people are already using it habitually. \no It is a commodity. \n \nThe relative low rating of most of the IDTV advantages though is related with the existing \ntechnical capability of the medium. Respondents felt that the medium has great potential but it is \nnot technically ready yet to fulfil them. \n \nTable 4 Advantages of IDTV as a distribution channel \n 1 Strongly \ndisagree \n2 Disagree 3\nNeutral \n4\nAgree \n5\nStrongly \nagree \n# of valid\nreplies \nMean Standard \nDeviation \nWide-reaching, populist \nchannel \n1\n3.3% \n2\n6.6% \n8\n26.6% \n8\n26.6% \n11 \n36.6% \n30 3.87 1.09 \nGreater consumer trust \ncompared to Internet \n1\n3.3% \n6\n20% \n9\n30% \n10 \n33.3% \n4\n13.3% \n30 3.33 1.04 \nGreater flexibility in \nmultimedia presentations\n2\n6.6% \n7\n23.3% \n7\n23.3% \n8\n26.6% \n6\n20% \n30 3.30 1.22 \nIncreased customer \ninteraction \n1\n3.3% \n11 \n36.6% \n11 \n36.6% \n5\n16.6% \n2\n6.6% \n30 2.87 0.96 \nSeveral respondents also disagreed with the concept of IDTV as a channel that increases customer \ninteraction. Despite the greater possibility for multimedia presentations, IDTV was seen as a \u201clean \nbackwards\u201d-type media. Customers can sit back and watch what happens on the screen and, to an \nextent, control it, but not necessarily interact and customise in the same way they would on the \nInternet. It will be the convergence between different technologies that will change the perception \nof TV from an entertainment unit to an interactive service station, offering entertainment, \ninformation and interaction with the external world. The introduction of the IDTV email for \nexample will gradually force viewers to change their attitude towards TV. \nSome interviewees predicted that by the year 2005 they expected that IDTV will dominate leisure \ntravel distribution. Table 5 illustrates the disadvantages of IDTV as a distribution platform. More \nthan half of respondents agreed that it is still developing technologically and, as such, it may not \nyet be fully functional and ready to be used in the home market on a large scale. Although IDTV \nusage is currently limited and can reach only a limited customer base, its customer base will \nexpand rapidly in the future. Interviewers explained that it is only a matter of time until the \ntechnology has developed to a degree that will enable the full capitalisation of the potential. They \nfelt that technological convergence and the expansion of commercial services on IDTV will enable \norganisations to take advantage of the full potential. ICT will become more advanced, \nincorporating an increasing number of eCommerce features that will render it superior to the \nInternet in terms of product information provision and ease of purchase.  \n \nTable 5 Disadvantages of IDTV as a distribution channel \n 1 \nStrongly \ndisagree\n2\nDisagree\n3\nNeutral\n4 Agree 5 \nStrongly \nagree \nNo reply # of valid\nreplies \nMean Standard \nDeviation \nTechnology still \nbeing developed \n1\n3.3% \n1\n3.3% \n8\n26.6% \n11 \n36.6% \n7\n23.3% \n2\n6.6% \n28 3.79 0.98 \nHigher cost to \nparticipate \n1\n3.3% \n3\n10% \n8\n26.6% \n10 \n33.3.% \n6\n20% \n2\n6.6% \n28 3.61 1.05 \nCurrently small \ncustomer base \ncompared to internet\n1\n3.3% \n4\n13.3% \n7\n23.3% \n9\n30% \n7\n23.3% \n2\n6.6% \n28 3.61 1.11 \nLess opportunity for \ncustomer interaction\n4\n13.3% \n8\n26.6% \n8\n26.6% \n7\n23.3% \n1\n3.3% \n2\n6.6% \n28 2.75 1.09 \nPotentially too much \nchoice \n3\n10% \n9\n30% \n10 \n33.3% \n5\n16.6% \n1\n3.3% \n2\n6.6% \n28 2.71 0.99 \nSecurity issues 6 \n20% \n12 \n40% \n9\n30% \n1\n3.3% \n 2 \n6.6% \n28 2.18 0.80 \nA significant number of respondents (mainly tour operators and high street travel agents) agreed \nthat high cost will prove to be a barrier for companies wishing to participate in IDTV marketing \nand distribution ventures. High entry cost barriers may favour exclusively larger brands, posing a \nserious obstacle to smaller companies, especially those operating exclusively on-line. However, \nwith a likely crossover between the Internet and IDTV, this situation may change. Security does \nnot seem to be a major concern for IDTV and a lesser problem than the Internet as the majority of \nrespondents replied negatively to the \u2018Security issues\u2019 options. This confirms the hypothesis that \nthe technology utilised for IDTV transactions will be more advanced than the one used on the \nInternet, as IDTV will operate in closed networks. \n \nThe majority of interviewees perceive IDTV as the \u201cnext big thing\u201d. They agreed that rather than \ndebating the role of the Internet vs. the one of IDTV, analysts and the tourism industry should \nconcentrate on how to take maximum advantage of the imminent technological convergence. The \nInternet and IDTV should be considered as enablers and ePlatforms for global travel distribution. \nWithin few years interviewees felt that the two platforms will be complementary and mutually \nreinforcing, developing the larger eTourism provision. They may potentially aim at different:  \n \n\u2022 markets and segments: higher socio-economic classes vs. lower income, \n\u2022 different times: morning\/noon\/evening\/night,  \n\u2022 geographical locations: countries\/regions \n\u2022 uses: business trips vs. leisure products and family holiday \n\u2022 locations of use: office\/home\/on the road  \n \nInterviewees clearly felt that the two platforms will run in parallel in the future. Naturally 90 \npercent mentioned the concept of convergence between the two technologies, enabling cross-\npromotion and cross-navigation. It is predicted therefore that tourism organisations will need to \ndistribute the same content through different ePlatforms. This convergence is going to take place \ngradually, and will be further enabled by the realisation of interconnectivity between Internet, \nIDTV and mobile devices. All electronic distribution channels will ultimately be running on \nenhanced and complementary Internet technologies. Interviewees expected that convergence will \nproduce seamless experiences for the user and it will enable each platform to perform best on its \nestablish strengths. The Internet will be a clear leader in the search, inventory development and \ntransaction front, whilst IDTV is expected to empower the multimedia element which will enable \nconsumers to download and watch real video footage from tourism destinations, products and \nservices. One interviewee suggested that IDTV will play a major role in the \u201cinspire\u201d stage, when \nconsumers are seeking inspiration before start searching for their tourism products and \nexperiences. \n \n3.3 Mobile and mCommerce Distribution \n \nAlthough the quantitative part of this research did not go into the issue of eMediaries based on \nmobile devices and mCommerce, a number of inferences emerged through the qualitative \nresearch. Interviewees felt that mobile devices will soon emerge as a major distribution ePlatform \nfor tourism. However, they felt that WAP has failed to fulfil expectations and there is a genuine \nmistrust currently by consumers. This is attributed to a marketing \u201cover-hype\u201d, which promised the \n\u201cInternet-on-the-go\u201d, developing expectations that could not be realistic with the current \ntechnology. Interviewees felt that until the 3rd generation (3G) mobile devices arrives sometime in \n2005 there will be limited opportunity for travel distribution through this platform.  \n \nIt is clear that the mCommerce will follow the Internet ePlatform, as a number of Internet-based \noperators will offer services through different platforms. Tourism providers already use WAP and \nSMS for distributing information, for allowing consumers to check flight arrivals and departures and \nfor checking in. Examples mentioned include airlines (e.g. Finnair: www.finnair.fi\/wap\/index.wml), \ndestinations (e.g. Tirol: wap.TIScover.at), electronic Travel Agencies (e.g. Expedia to Go: \nwww.expedia.co.uk) and hotels (e.g. Amari wap.amari.com). Interviewees felt that tourism \norganisations will expand their Internet provision to support mobile devices once the technology is \nin place to do that. They felt that the challenge really lies on developing content and information \nthat can be distributed through many different platforms. Perhaps mobile devices will be more \nuseful to business frequent travellers and to people that habitually purchase familiar tourism \nproducts, rather to novices that need to search and identify the most suitable product before \npurchasing. They also identified mCommerce as a great opportunity for last minute sales as well as \na medium enabling consumers to make change to reservations near to departure or arrival time.  \n \nIn addition, interviewees anticipated that telecommunication companies will develop on-line travel \nservices in partnership with electronic Travel Agencies and other suppliers. For example Genie has \nalready developed partnerships with Expedia.com, British Airways and Lastminute.com to enable \nWAP based tourism distribution. Perhaps the business model will need to change as consumers are \nwilling to pay for getting connected to WAP portals. Therefore tourism organisations may be able \nto charge telecommunication companies fees for content and therefore share their income from \nthe connection time. \n \nInterviewees felt that mCommerce will be a major change in the way tourism products are \ndistributed as it will support location dependent distribution. mCommerce will also enable \nconsumers to purchase products on the go and at the same time it will enable them to identify the \nlocally available products and services. Similarly mCommerce will allow organisations to target \nconsumers at their proximity and to provide special promotions, offers and services. However, they \nemphasised that the technical difficulties experienced by 3G developers may delay the \ncommercialisation of these services. \n \n4 The Future of eTourism intermediaries and Distribution Channels \n \nAttempting to predict the future of tourism distribution is a difficult task on its own. Aiming at \nassessing how tourism eMediaries will evolve is even more complex, as on the hand, technological \ndevelopments emerge rapidly and on the other, tourism distribution is also one of the most \ndynamic sectors of the industry. Some of the following issues are visioning the future and aiming \nto identify the major trends and issues. \n \n4.1 Distribution Channels and ePlatforms in a 5-Years\u2019 Span \n \nThe Internet, IDTV and mobile communication devices were clearly identified as the three most \nsignificant ePlatforms for the five-year span (Table 6). They empower consumers to obtain more \ninformation, in more detail, in a more independent manner, matching their increased knowledge \nabout destinations and products as well as their sophistication. Interviewees mentioned that \ntechnological convergence will enable tourism organisations to use the same content and \ninformation to distribute through all three platforms for different markets, users, times, locations \nand occasions. \n \nThe commercial introduction of the Internet has started a process of change in the travel product \nbuying habits of both leisure and business users. The Internet has, indeed, allowed more people to \naccess high quality information quickly and with minimum inconvenience. It also gave the \npossibility to purchase travel products on-line just as easily. In addition, it generated great service \nexpectations, as consumers anticipate to be served on a 24hours\/365days basis and at their own \nconvenience, rather than during the office hours of tourism providers. This trend towards the use \nof Internet for travel booking is therefore likely to expand and dominate. Several tourism suppliers \nand particularly no-frills airlines, such as Easyjet and Ryanair, already claim that the majority of \ntheir bookings and up to 80 percent is coming from consumers booking directly on-line. \nInterviewees believed that the initial business travel bias will eventually be followed by the leisure \ntraveller as more consumers will trust the Internet platform to arrange their inventory and as more \norganisations will develop their offering on-line. Besides on-line travel agents and suppliers, the \nInternet allows GDSs, which hold the most detailed travel stock databases available, to move \ncloser to end-users. They can do that by either working under their own name or by powering and \nin some cases owning on-line travel agents (e.g. Sabre\/Travelocity.com, Galileo\/Trip.com and \nWorldspan\/Expedia.com). \n \nSimilarly to the Internet with the business travel market, the introduction of IDTV is likely to have \na strong impact on the home\/leisure market. Interviewees expect an increasing quantity of on-\nrequest information and booking possibilities, available at the touch of a remote IDTV control \nbutton. The trend towards the use of mobile communication devices is mostly determined by the \ncommodification of mobile phones in the past few years, coupled with an increasing need to be \nable to obtain information while \u2018on the move\u2019. Already existing mobile technologies enable a \ncertain degree of interaction with tourism suppliers. For example, business travellers can received \ninformation on arrivals and departures as well as check-in through their mobile phone for a \nnumber of airlines, including British Airways, Swissair and Singapore airlines. The scheduled \nintroduction of advanced mobile technology will enable consumers to access enhanced \ninformation, such as customised travel schedules and booking facilities through their mobile \nphones. The development of the 3rd generation mobile phones incorporating GPRS and UMTS \ntechnologies will eventually support comprehensive mCommerce and mService.  \n \nThe conventional telephone also obtained a high percentage of positive votes. Interviewees felt \nthat despite increasing consumer confidence in on-line booking and support mechanisms, many \nconsumers may still feel happier to confirm their bookings or ask queries by calling a call centre \nand talking to an operator. In the case of the leisure market, the telephone was regarded an \nessential method to perform bookings, partly because the on-line Internet provision is not \nsufficiently developed yet and partly because the majority of the current consumers are not \ntechnologically advanced to undertake the purchase of packages on-line. As currently much of the \ntourism product advertising, carried out through advertisements in the press or even through cable \nchannels such as the TV Travel Shop channel, requires bookings to be made by telephone \ninterviewees felt that conventional telephone will keep playing an important role. This trend will \ncontinue. Hence, interviewees felt that the telephone will act as a step between face to face \ndistribution and fully on-line service. \n \nTable 6 \u2013 The most prominent eTourism distribution platforms and channels in 5 years \n 1 - \nStrongly \ndisagree\n2 \u2013\nDisagre\ne\n3 \u2013\nNeither \nAgree nor \nDisagree\n4 \u2013\nAgree \n5 \u2013\nStrongly \nagree \nNo \nreply \n# of valid\nreplies \nMean Standard \nDeviation\nEFuture Platforms \nInternet   1 \n3.3% \n7\n23.3% \n22 \n73.3% \n 30 4.70 0.53 \nInteractive TV 2\n6.6% \n7\n23.3% \n7\n23.3% \n14 \n46.6% \n 30 4.10 0.98 \nMobile \nPhones\/ \nPortable \ncommunicatio\nn devices \n \n3\n10% \n4\n13.3% \n12 \n40% \n11 \n36.6% \n 30 4.03 0.95 \neConventional Platforms \nConventional \ntelephone \n1\n3.3% \n1\n3.3% \n8\n26.6% \n10 \n33.3% \n9\n30% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.86 1.01 \nGDS  3 \n10% \n11 \n36.6% \n8\n26.6% \n6\n20% \n2\n6.6% \n28 3.61 0.94 \nHigh street \nshops \n1\n3.3% \n4\n13.3% \n11 \n36.6% \n8\n26.6% \n5\n16.6% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.41 1.03 \nSelf service \nkiosk \n1\n3.3% \n10 \n33.3% \n6\n20% \n9\n30% \n2\n6.6% \n2\n6.6% \n28 3.04 1.05 \nViewdata 9 \n30% \n11 \n36.6% \n3\n10% \n3\n10% \n 4 \n13.3%\n26 2.00 0.96 \n \nA further significant percentage of respondents believe that GDSs will still play an important role in \nthe 5 years\u2019 time frame. Although many new emerging competitors may pose a threat to the \nsupremacy of GDSs, they have reacted to the former by creating alliances with on-line travel \nagents and by offering a new range of products.  Hence interviewees felt that GDSs are already \nthe backbone for most Internet-enabled distribution and they predicted that their role will change \nfrom travel agency supporters to eMediary-facilitators, often working in the background. Others \nsuggested that GDSs initiatives to develop consumer interfaces will also strengthen their position. \n \nAs for the distribution channels that are going to lose ground in the next five years, the results of \nthe survey showed that respondents felt that, above all others, Viewdata is the distribution \nchannel that will not survive. There are four reasons behind this choice: Firstly, Viewdata is a tool \nprincipally used by high street travel agents and is not aimed directly at the consumer. Thus, if \ntraditional high street travel agents are partially disintermediated, as many believe they will be, \nthere will no longer be a profitable market for Viewdata to operate, and ultimately no conditions \nfor it to exist. Secondly, the Viewdata technology is regarded as rather outdated. Its interface is \nnot user-friendly, it is slow and information needs to be entered every time a query is made. For \nthis reason, competitive travel agents as well as competitive Viewdata providers (e.g. \nImminus\/Telewest) are expected to opt for new, more customisable, Windows-based systems that \nwill use Internet interfaces to facilitate interaction with tour operators and other suppliers. Thirdly, \nconsumers increasingly bring to travel agencies printouts from the Internet, either from the same \ncompany (e.g. ThomasCook.com) or competitors (e.g. Expedia.com) and request travel agencies \nto either match the offer they hold or to do the actual booking for them. Unless agencies have \nInternet compatible computers they will be unable to fulfil the demand. Finally tour operators will \neventually impose a move from legacy systems to more advanced technologies which will be \nunable to communicate with Viewdata terminals. This move would enable better functionality, \naccess to information available to consumers through the Internet, and interactivity.  \n4.2 Distribution Channels and ePlatforms in a 15-Years\u2019 Span \n \nSpeculating for a 15-year span is really dangerous in this fast-moving environment. However this \nsurvey aimed at exploring where experts felt that electronic tourism distribution will be going in \nthe long term, recognising the dangers of being helplessly outdated only few years later. The \nresults of this enquiry show an interesting correlation with the 5-year prediction results. From the \nresponses obtained (Table 7) the most evident change is in the Mobile phones\/Portable \ncommunication devices field. The overwhelming majority of respondents believed mobile \neMediaries will play an important role in tourism distribution in the next 15 years. Interviewees felt \nthat consumer will eventually have an even greater need to access information, and hence make \nbookings, from any place, individually, rather than from a static location. Users are expected to \nrequest and receive relevant travel information and holiday offers on mobile devices, from \noperators that offer this service. \n \nTable 7 - The most prominent distribution platforms and channels in 15 years \n 1 \u2013 \nStrongly \ndisagree \n2 \u2013\nDisagre\ne\n3 -\nNeither \nAgree \nnor \nDisagre\ne\n4 \u2013\nAgree \n5 \u2013\nStrongly \nagree \nNo reply # of \nvalid  \nreplies \nMean Standard \nDeviation \neFuture Platforms \nMobile \nPhones\/ \nPortable \ncommunicati\non devices \n 9\n30% \n18 \n60% \n3\n10% \n27 4.67 0.47 \nInteractive \nTV \n 1 \n3.3% \n2\n6.6% \n4\n13.3%\n20 \n66.6% \n3\n10% \n27 4.59 0.78 \nInternet  1 \n3.3% \n1\n3.3% \n8\n26.6%\n17 \n56.6% \n3\n10% \n27 4.52 0.74 \neConventional Platforms \nSelf service \nkiosk \n5\n16.6% \n5\n16.6% \n7\n23.3% \n7\n23.3%\n2\n6.6% \n4\n13.3% \n \n26 2.85 1.23 \nHigh street \nshops \n2\n6.6% \n10 \n33.3% \n8\n26.6% \n5\n16.6%\n1\n3.3% \n4\n13.3% \n26 2.73 0.98 \nConventional \ntelephone \n5\n16.6% \n5\n16.6% \n10 \n33.3% \n4\n13.3%\n2\n6.6% \n4\n13.3% \n26 2.73 1.16 \nGDS 2 \n6.6% \n12 \n40% \n5\n16.6% \n6\n20% \n1\n3.3% \n4\n13.3% \n26 2.69 1.03 \nViewdata 23 \n76.6% \n1\n3.3% \n1\n3.3% \n 5\n16.6% \n25 1.12 0.43 \nAnother interesting result emerging from the survey is a marked decrease in positive answers for \nthe Internet, which could be correlated to a slight increase in positive answers for IDTV. A \ncrossover between the Internet and IDTV might result to a greater penetration of the home \nmarket. This may justify an increase in the use of IDTV as a distribution channel for leisure users, \nwith the Internet remaining, through the use of intranets and extranets, as an established \ndistribution channel for business-to-business travel solutions. Interviewees felt that capabilities of \nboth mobile devices and IDTV will outperform the Internet but several mentioned that in 15 years \ntime it will be difficult to separate the different ePlatforms. \nRespondents felt that self-service kiosks and high street shops may still perform a role and \ninterviewees felt strongly that high street travel agencies will continue exist. They anticipated \nhowever that they will change to holiday shops providing a holiday experience, integrated and \ncomprehensive service and a much more personalised advice. GDSs as well as Viewdata systems \nand the conventional telephone recorded a higher negative response rate than in the five year \ntime frame. This indicates that these more conventional forms of distribution are likely to be \nbypassed or radically change their operations in order to serve a more \u2018wired\u2019 and sophisticated \nmarketplace. While GDSs were not expected to be driven out of the market, experts felt that their \nrole is expected to change dramatically to provide the backbone for the travel distribution and to \npower tourism eMediaries solutions and services, rather than support travel agencies. \n \n5 The Changing Role of the Traditional Travel eMediaries \n \nThe need for modernisation and the entrance of new competitors in the market influence the \nfuture of traditional electronic distribution channels (Table 8). Traditional eMediaries (GDSs, \nViewdata, Teletext) therefore need to change roles and to develop new competencies. Many \nrespondents believe that GDSs, leisure travel networks and tour operators will move one step \ncloser to the consumer, and sell directly to them. GDSs will retain their role as suppliers of booking \nsystems to travel agents but their core competencies will probably shift from this role. \nInterviewees felt that the future of GDS lies in providing the backbone to future eMediaries. Their \nestablish procedures for inventory building, ticketing, income clearing and distribution to suppliers \nare in the centre of eCommerce for the tourism industry. \n \nMany interviewees also felt that traditional travel eMediaries will start distributing more than just \ntravel products in order to add value to their offering, by providing content and ancillary services. \nInterviewees felt that personalising the tourism product will be critical for the successful \neMediaries of the future. This will be achieved by outsourcing several functions and services to \nexternal companies and through establishing partnerships with other suppliers insourcing elements \nthat can add value for the customer. They will need therefore to develop and offer \u2018one-stop-\nshops\u2019 for users. This will enable them to maximise revenue from their customers, while at the \nsame time maintaining an edge against Web portals such as Yahoo! and other new comers to the \ntravel retail market, such as vortals and auction sites. They will also develop their ability to cross-\nsell travel-related products (such as travel guides, accessories etc.). This will be particularly \nfeasible for GDSs that own or have realised collaborations with on-line travel agents. \n \nMost interviewees (70 percent) suggested that instead of the widely reported disintermediation of \nthe traditional distribution channels they expected a re-intermediation. As new on-line travel \nagencies enter the market offering value-added products and customisable user features, many of \nthe traditional eMediaries will reinvent themselves to adopt to the new realities.  \n \nTable 8 Statements on the Changing Role of the eTourism intermediaries \n 1 \nStrongly \ndisagree\n2\nDisagre\ne\n3\nNeutra\nl\n4\nAgree \n5\nStrongly \nagree \nNo reply # of \nvalid \nreplies \nMean Standard \nDeviation\nThe traditional travel \neMediaries will \nincreasingly sell directly \nto the customer  \n 2 \n6.6% \n5\n16.6%\n13 \n43.3% \n9\n30% \n1\n3.3% \n29 4.00 0.87 \nThe traditional travel \neMediaries will start \ndistributing more than \njust travel products \n 3 \n10% \n10 \n33.3%\n8\n26.6% \n7\n6.6% \n2\n6.6% \n28 3.68 0.97 \nOn-line travel agents will \nincreasingly connect \ndirectly with travel \nsuppliers, bypassing the \nGDSs \n 1 \n3.3% \n14 \n46.6%\n8\n26.6% \n6\n20% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.66 0.84 \nThe GDSs will be \nincreasingly bypassed by \ntravel suppliers \ndistributing directly on \nthe Internet \n 6 \n20% \n11 \n36.6%\n9\n30% \n3\n10% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.31 0.91 \nThe Leisure Travel \nNetworks will increasingly \nbe bypassed by direct \ndistribution on the \nInternet \n1\n3.3% \n5\n16.6% \n11 \n36.6%\n8\n26.6% \n4\n13.3% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.31 1.02 \nThe traditional travel \neMediaries will become \nless concerned with \nservicing travel agents \n 7 \n23.3% \n10 \n33.3%\n8\n26.6% \n4\n13.3% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.31 0.99 \nThe traditional travel \neMediaries will \nincreasingly be bypassed \nby tour operator \nreservation system \nsuppliers developing their \nown distribution systems \n3\n10% \n5\n16.6% \n12 \n40% \n7\n23.3% \n2\n6.6% \n1\n3.3% \n29 3.00 1.05 \nWhile traditional off-line agencies will progressively lose a share of their market, there will always \nbe a need for an aggregator of holiday packages, flights and travel advice. Thus traditionally \neMediaries will need to modernise and use on-line tools to address the emerging market. Teletext \nwas mentioned by one interviewee as a prime example of an organisation that is gradually \nmigrating on the Internet, enhancing their service and attracting new customers. High street \nagents are expected to retain a larger market share in low-margin package holidays. This is likely \nto remain unchanged until Interactive Digital TV becomes more widespread. However, \ninterviewees predicted that flight bookings will be increasingly served by on-line agencies and \nairlines selling directly to consumers, using their own on-line reservation systems. Customer \nRelationship Management systems, special offers and frequent flyer clubs will all offer incentives to \nconsumers to purchase flights directly. Therefore interviewees predicted that the successful \neMediaries of the future will adopt a \u201cclicks and mortal\u201d strategy where a \u201cclick-in\u201d (Internet and \nmCommerce), \u201ccall-in\u201d (supported by calling centres) and \u201cstep-in\u201d (high street presence) will \ndominate. \n \n6. Conclusions: The Rise of New eMediaries and the future of traditional eMediaries \nThe use of new distribution channels and the launch of value-added services and features across \nall ePlatforms and distribution channels are clearly identified as the main factors affecting the \ncompetitiveness of all tourism intermediaries. New eMediaries (e.g. on-line travel agents, portals) \nin the electronic distribution market challenge traditional eMediaries (e.g. GDSs and Viewdata) as \nthey gradually penetrate the marketplace, gain direct access to consumers and increase their \nmarketshare. The timely delivery of relevant, content-rich information was identified by \ninterviewees as one of the main differentiating factors in the on-line market. Traditional \neMediaries, in contrast, offer limited added-value features, content, availability information and \nbooking functionality. Respondents clearly indicated that they anticipate that new eMediaries will \nbe taking advantage of their capabilities and will increase their presence in the marketplace. In \ncontrast, traditional eMediaries will have to either modernise and adopt to the new realities by \ndeveloping their on-line presence or face significant loses in their market share and value. \n \nThe commercial introduction and subsequent potential take-off of tourism services based on IDTV \nand mobile technology will enable new eMediaries to achieve a further penetration of both the \nhome and business markets. The eminent convergence of the Internet, IDTV and mobile \ntelephony will provide a further competitive advantage for new eMediaries as they will be adopting \na multi-platform approach to serve different users at different times and situations. \n \nHowever, the proliferation of new eMediaries, coupled with weaknesses in the current business \nmodel of many of these, may hinder their competitiveness. Companies developing tourism \napplications to become available through the Internet, IDTV and mobile devices are often young \nand inexperienced in this market. Their links with suppliers may therefore be volatile, especially if \nthey are not able to achieve significant volume of bookings within a fairly short time. Drawing \nfinancial resources for developing systems is also a major resource issue as successful eMediaries \nnormally do not break even for at least 4-5 years. New eMediaries need to develop their distinct \nbranding and establish their presence in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Moreover, \nalthough the cost of start-up for on-line businesses can be relatively low, adopting a multi-channel \nstrategy and expanding into IDTV and mobile platforms may prove prohibitively expensive for \nmany small companies.  \n \nNew eMediaries currently have a competitive edge over traditional eMediaries, on the on-line \nmarket. However, tourism suppliers, such as airlines and hotel chains, as well as destinations and \ntraditional intermediaries such as travel agencies and tour operators bring resources together and \ndevelop their on-line provision. New eMediaries therefore need to building relationships with \nsuppliers and to use the entire range of ePlatforms to service their customers. Provided that the \nright alliances are made, this would also minimise costs and maximise revenues through \ncommissions. eTourism is still in its infancy and it is widely predicted to be one of the most rapidly \nexpanding industries on-line. Inevitably new eMediaries will therefore go through a natural \nselection process, which will separate the stronger players \u2013 ones with sound business models, \nstability and the possibility to expand on all distribution channels and platforms available \u2013 from \nthose that will fail. Success will probably depend on the ability of organisations to target the most \nappropriate niches and to form partnerships that enhance fulfil the need of the marketplace, image \nand increase market share. Being able to fulfil customer expectations and providing comprehensive \nand coherent service will be critical.  \n \nDisintermediation poses a threat to traditional eMediaries. In the case of Viewdata, respondents \nbelieved that it is going to be gradually phased out in the next five years. Teletext has already \nestablished its online presence on the Internet and therefore it is already refocusing its \ndistribution. However innovative traditional eMediaries can also take advantage of their established \nbrands and develop their on-line presence to communicate directly with their clientele. The results \nshowed that a significant cross-section of respondents believed GDSs run the risk of being \nbypassed by smaller inventory services, such as those utilised by web-based travel agents and \nsuppliers. These, although more limited in terms of information, are much cheaper to run than the \nGDSs. However, respondents believe that GDSs would still play an important role in the next five \nand fifteen years. The rapid technological developments and the emergence of the Internet \ndemonstrate that they will need to modernise and refocus their operations if they are to survive in \nthe future. Two possible compatible rather than mutually exclusive currents of thought were \nidentified: \n \n\u2022 Firstly, those who believe that GDSs are destined to give up much of their current powers and \nsupremacy and will simply become high-speed switches or host systems on behalf of travel \nsuppliers. GDSs should be regarded not as distribution channels but as enablers, providing \ninterconnectivity between suppliers and travel distributors. Some interviewees supported \ntherefore that GDSs will probably re-emerge as the backbone of the tourism distribution, \nsupporting a entire range of eMediaries with a distribution mechanism. Smaller GDSs will \nprobably be consolidated, hence reducing the number of large players in the market to only \ntwo or three globally. \n\u2022 Secondly, some interviewees felt that GDSs have the potential to capture a significant share of \nthe direct-to-customer market and to establish themselves as providers of travel products with \nan emphasis on the business market. They suggested that GDSs should also adopt a multi-\nchannel distribution approach, endorsing and supporting all the technologies chosen by \ncustomers and developing their on-line presence. This can be achieved by interfacing legacy \nsystems for the front-end Internet sites and by introducing more content rather than just \nproviding a repository service for travel itineraries. \n \nThere is one point that all respondents agreed upon: there is great change ahead and only \ncompetitive, flexible and dynamic eMediaries will use both old and new ePlatforms to survive and \nexpand in the future. Mergers, alliances, partnerships, re-developments will all be used regularly to \nenable partners to remain competitive. Inevitably there will be several winners who will use all \navailable ePlatforms to deliver products in the most suitable way for their market segments. \nHowever, a large proportion of players will fail to modernise fast enough to develop suitable \nbusiness models and market propositions. These players will probably suffer catastrophic \nconsequences. The only winner in the future will be the consumer as well as principals and \nintermediaries that will adopt a dynamic, flexible and innovative strategic and tactical \nmanagement.  \n \nReferences \n \nArchdale, G.
