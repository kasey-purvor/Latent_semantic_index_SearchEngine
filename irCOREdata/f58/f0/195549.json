Introduction\nT HIS paper reports on an experimental investigation of fluc-tuating pressures and base pressure variation on a circular\ncylinder in crossflow over the subsonic speed range. The initial\ncontext andmotivation emerged fromwork on a family of gas turbine\nnozzle vanes with a blunt trailing edge [1]. Denton and Xu [2]\nestablished that for such blades this area of reduced static pressure\naround the trailing edgewas amajor contributor to total pressure loss.\nTurbine blades with a thick trailing edge, such as those investigated\nby Carscallen et al. [3], had a high loss penalty associated with the\ntrailing edge. This loss penalty was greater than would have been\nexpected from a simple backward-facing step and had been\nquantified by Deych et al. [4] and Craig and Cox [5].\nThe high losses remained unexplained until high-speed schlieren\nphotography was applied to cascades [6]. In subsonic flow past a\nblunt trailing-edged turbine blade, or past the more straightforward\ngeometry of a circular cylinder, periodic vortex shedding is almost\nalways present up to a Mach number of about 1.2. Vortex shedding\nwas found to be present in the wakes of blades with thick trailing\nedges, often associated with pressure waves propagating upstream\nalong the blade surfaces, when the local freestream flow was\nsubsonic [6]. Hoerner [7] previously correlated base drag for airfoils\nand backward-facing steps; he found that the base pressure of an\nairfoil was consistently lower than that of an equivalent backward-\nfacing step. He attributed this discrepancy to the existence of a von\nK\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street in the wake of the airfoil. For turbine blades,\nCicatelli and Sieverding [8] conducted an investigation into the effect\nof vortex shedding on the surface pressure distribution around the\ncylindrical trailing edge of a linear cascade turbine stator blade using\na surface-mounted pressure transducer. They found that the pressure\nin this region fluctuated by as much as 8% of the downstream\ndynamic head near separation and by 4.8% in the base region. This\nseemed to indicate that the instantaneous base pressure could be\nsignificantly different from the time-averaged value, giving poor\ncomputational results if steady-state methods, such as conventional\nReynolds-averagedNavier\u2013Stokes, were used. It has been concluded\n[9] that, for bluff body flows, \u201ccalculation methods which neglect\nbase pressure effects are incapable of accurately calculating the flow\npatterns or the total pressure loss.\u201d\nPresented as Paper 4305 at the 38th AIAA Fluid Dynamics Conference,\nSeattle, WA, 23\u201326 June 2008; received 12 September 2008; revision\nreceived 7 April 2009; accepted for publication 26 April 2009.

Member AIAA\nAIAA JOURNAL\nVol. 47, No. 9, September 2009\n2121\nDespite the importance of trailing-edge vortex shedding for\nturbine blading, this problem is amore general one. It was considered\nimportant to reduce the study to the most significant variables and to\nattempt to address the problem in a relatively generic form. For this\nreason it was decided to simplify the boundary conditions to an\nisolated and rigidly mounted circular cylinder in subsonic crossflow.\nThe base pressure is known to be strongly dependent on the Mach\nnumber. At supersonic speeds, the main cause of low base pressure is\nthe strong spatial variations of pressure through shocks and\nexpansions; this tends to be a relatively steady process. At subsonic\nspeeds, shocks only play a role as the velocity reaches critical levels.\nIn general, the unsteady process of vortex shedding is more\nimportant. These are, therefore, two quite distinct flow regimes. This\ninvestigation focuses exclusively on the subsonic speed range and the\nattendant flow fluctuations.\nThe classical von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street is the most usual shedding\nmode at subsonic speeds and results in predictable configuration and\nfrequency characteristics. These vary with the thickness of the\nboundary layers at separation and, therefore, with Reynolds number.\nUnlike in the case of a turbine blade, the time-averaged boundary\nlayers on either side of the circular cylinder are symmetrical and\nsufficiently thin not to smear the shed vortices.\nIn the current investigation [10], wake traverses of total pressure\nand temperature were taken and will be the subject of a further\npublication. In addition to the wake traverses, surface pressure\nreadings from around the cylinder were also taken in an effort to\nincrease the understanding of the vortex shedding and its relationship\nwith the base pressure of circular cylinders.\nData on the flow past circular cylinders at high subsonic speeds\nare quite limited, and the purpose of this paper is to extend that\nrather sparse data set. Systematic modeling is ultimately required,\nhowever. This calls for a greater physical understanding of the\nrather complex phenomenon of vortex shedding and its effect on the\nsurface pressure fluctuations in the periodically separated flows of\nthe base region.\nII. Facility and Instrumentation for Circular\nCylinder Testing\nThe National Research Council (NRC) 1.5 m trisonic blowdown\nwind tunnel in Ottawa was used for this investigation, with a two-\ndimensional flow working section fitted. The test section, shown in\nFig. 1, was 0.381 mwide by 1.524 m high and 3.581 m long. The air\nsupply comprised three 143 m3 tanks that could be pressurized up to\n2.13 MPa (21 atm). In this mode, the wind tunnel had a discharge\nMach number range of 0.1\u20130.9 and was run at a constant Reynolds\nnumber of 6:83\u0001\u00020:03\u0003 \u0004 105. The Reynolds number was based on\nthe cylinder diameter and freestream inflow velocity. The operating\nReynolds number range and run time were dependent on the Mach\nnumber and set by adjusting the total and static pressure of the test\nsection. Blowdown operation resulted in the freestream total\ntemperature dropping over the course of each run as the air in the\nsupply tanks expanded. The model was mounted 2.388 m down-\nstream of the end of the contraction on reinforced mounts in a three-\ncomponent balance. Because of the method of reinforcement, the\nbalance could not be used tomeasure the forces acting on the cylinder\nbut it did provide a convenient means of rotationally indexing the\ncylinder. The balance could be rotated through a range of\u000255 deg at\na rate of 15 deg =s. Tunnel-wall boundary-layer control was applied\nusing ejector-augmented sidewall suction through 0:602 \u0004 0:452 m2\nporous plates.\nTwo series of tests were conducted, in 2000 and 2002, respec-\ntively, and the results of the surface pressure measurements were\ndesignated accordingly. All cylinder surfaces were polished to a\nhydraulically smooth finish. In the 2000 series of tests, the model\nwas an aluminum circular cylinder with a diameter of 37.26 mm\nand a span of 381 mm. A single 0.062-in.-diam Kulite XCQ-062-\n25D ultraminiature pressure transducer was mounted so that the\nB screen, which covered the pressure sensitive diaphragm, was\nflush with the cylinder surface at midspan. For the 2002 series,\nsimilar-sized steel cylinders were used and four 0.093-in.-diam\nEntran transducers were mounted at equally spaced distances\naround the circumference.\nIn the 2000 series of tests, the freestream turbulence level\nincreased from 0.24% at Mach 0.4 to 0.26% at 0.6 and 0.34% at 0.8.\nSubsequent modifications have reduced these levels marginally for\nthe 2002 series.\nA tube-mounted Kulite XCQ-062-25D ultraminiature pressure\ntransducer was carried in a wake probe used for traversing\ndownstream of the cylinder. The pressure transducer was mounted in\na conventional pitot configuration for total pressure measurement\nsuch that its face pointed directly into the flow. The sensitivity to flow\ndirection was that of a conventional pitot tube, giving a 1% error\nfor a 10 deg misalignment. The probe sting was mounted for wake\ntraverse using a triangulated support. The sting and support were\ndesigned so that the probe tip would be 6 cylinder diameters or\n223.6 mm downstream of the model\u2019s leeward-most point, as shown\nin Fig. 1.\nCross sections of the cylinders used for the 2000 and 2002 test\nseries are shown schematically in Fig. 2. Surface pressure measure-\nments were taken in 5 deg increments from 10 deg below the leading\nedge to 10 deg below the trailing edge. The forward stagnation point\nwas the zero location, and the azimuthal orientation was such that the\nangle increased in a clockwise direction. The cylinder could be\nrotationally indexed, thusminimizing the number of surface pressure\ntransducers required. Data were taken for 2 s at each position. Each\nsurface pressure traverse was taken over two blowdowns. In the first\nof these, the cylinder was traversed from 10 deg below the leading\nedge to around 100 deg above it. The second traverse covered the 80\u2013\n190 deg locations.\nAlongside each surface pressure reading, a 2 s record was taken\nfrom the wake probe pressure transducer that acted as a phase\nreference. Phase reference locations were chosen for pressure\nmeasurementswith strong signals thatwere dominated by the vortex-\nshedding fundamental frequency. The signals were low-pass filtered\nat 40 kHz, for antialiasing, before being recorded at a sample rate of\n100 kHz directly onto the PC through National Instruments data\nacquisition cards.\nIII. Results and Discussion\nA. Surface Pressure Distribution\nFigures 3 and 4 show time-averaged surface pressure distributions\nfor the circular cylinders, taken from the 2000 and 2002 series of\ntests, respectively.

However, at\nMach 0.6 there are considerable differences between the results of the\ntwo series. These are most significant over the azimuthal angle range\nfrom 90 to 110 deg. Themost probable cause of such a difference is a\nchange in the way the circular cylinder was instrumented in the two\nexperiments. In the 2000 series, one surface pressure transducer was\nused, located as sketched in Fig. 2, whereas in the 2002 series four\npressure transducers were used, evenly distributed around the\ncylinder circumference at midspan. As the cylinder is rotated to\nmeasure the surface pressure at different azimuthal angles, the\npositions of the pressure transducers change the effective geometry\nof the test model. Specifically, whereas in the 2000 series the flow\nsees a smooth cylindrical surface upstream of the measurement\nlocation, in the 2002 series the flow is perturbed by the presence of\nthe upstream pressure transducer. This is likely to have affected the\nboundary-layer tripping, as will be discussed in Sec. III.D. The\ntripping of the cylinder surface boundary layer affects its separation\nand the pressure recovery on the leeward surface over the Mach\nnumber range from 0.5 to 0.7. Figures 3 and 4 indicate that the flow is\nparticularly sensitive at Mach 0.6.\nB. Drag and Base Drag Coefficients\nThe change in base pressure distribution at Mach 0.6 can best be\nquantified byfinding the coefficients of formdrag,CD, and base drag,\nCBD, defined in Eqs. (3) and (4), for the various profiles and plotting\nthem against the Mach number, as in Fig. 5.\nCD \u0005\nZ\n\u0001\u0005180\n\u0001\u00050\nCp cos \u0001 \u0007 d\u0001 (3)\nCBD \u0005\nZ\n\u0001\u0005180\n\u0001\u0005sep\nCp cos \u0001 \u0007 d\u0001 (4)\nThis method of calculating profile drag includes contributions\nfrom formdrag only and neglects skin friction and drag created by the\nloss of total pressure across any local shockwave that may be present\naround the cylinder surface. At aReynolds number of 6:83 \u0004 105, the\ncontribution to the profile drag from skin friction drag is very small\n[11].Given that theflow is subsonic and transonic, the contribution to\nthe drag by total pressure loss through shocks will be small, although\nit will increase, alongwith the discrepancy caused by neglecting it, as\nthe Mach number approaches unity.\nC. Compressible Flow Regimes\nBefore considering the differences between the two sets of data, an\nexplanation of the changes in CD over the Mach number range will\ngive insight into the reason for the differences. From Fig. 5 it can be\nseen that both CD and CBD start low and then rise to a maximum at\nMach 0.6, before falling off at Mach 0.7 and then rising again slowly\nat the higherMach numbers. These variations over theMach number\nrange are compatible with the compressible flow regimes described\nby Zdravkovich [11], namely, shockless, intermittent shock wave,\npermanent shock wave, and wake shock wave. Figure 6 is adapted\nfrom the work of Dyment et al. [12] (Mach 0.45 and 0.64) and\nFig. 4 Pressure distributions from the 2002 series data.\nFig. 5 Drag and base drag coefficients over theMach number range of\n0:4 \u0001 Ma \u0001 0:95.\n2124 ACKERMAN ETAL.\nDyment and Gryson [13] (Mach 0.80 and 0.90) and illustrates the\ndifferent regimes.\nAt Mach 0.4, the flow is in the shockless regime and, therefore, is\nstrongly Reynolds-number dependent; it is this that determines CD.\nIn this case, given the Reynolds number used in the test, the flow falls\ninto the transitional boundary layer 3 (TrBL3) subsonic regime [11].\nThis explains the lack of vortex shedding and lowCD observed at this\nMach number: \u201cFurther increase in Re [into the TrBL3 regime]\nbrings transition to the primary laminar separation line in an irregular\nmanner. This leads to the disruption and fragmentation of separation\nbubbles along the span of the cylinder. The irregularly fragmented\nseparation line prevents eddy [vortex] separation. . .\u201d [11]. The lack\nof vortex shedding permits the high level of pressure recovery, seen at\nMach 0.4 in Fig. 4, which results in the low CD.\nBetweenMach 0.4 and 0.5 the flow becomes critical; local regions\nof flow about the cylinder become momentarily supersonic and the\nflow enters the intermittent shock wave regime. The oscillating\nflowfield present in this regime, which results in the flow being\nsupersonic only on one side of the cylinder at a time, leads to\nincreased pressure fluctuations compared with the previous Mach\nnumber. This can be clearly seen in the change in the rms level and the\nmaximum and minimum pressure levels seen in Fig. 4, at freestream\nMach numbers of 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. The surface pressure\ncoefficient at which the local isentropic Mach number is unity for a\nMach 0.4 inflow is lower than the minimum surface pressure\ncoefficient reported in Fig. 4. Hence, theMach 0.4 inflow of the 2002\nseries is subcritical. Similar considerations indicate that the flowwas\nmomentarily supersonic for an inflow Mach number of 0.5.\nAs the freestream Mach number increases beyond the critical\nlimit, the region behind the cylinder in which the vortices are formed\nshortens. The increase inCD leading up to Mach 0.6 is a result of the\ncommencement of vortex shedding, the shortening of the vortex-\nshedding region with increasing Mach number, and the formation of\nthe local shockwaves as the intermittent shockwave regime strength-\nens. Beyond around Mach 0.65 the flow enters the permanent shock\nwave regime, shown in Fig. 6c. The permanent shock wave regime\nfeatures the movement of the location of formation and the shedding\nof the vortices downstream of the cylinder surface. The vortices and\nthe shocks are a coupled system. The shocks are inevitable but they\ncouple with a free shear layer, oscillating longitudinally with the\nshocks, to give vortex roll up and shedding. This lengthens the\nformation region, increases the pressure recovery, and gives a\nslightly earlier separation. This, in turn, leads to the reduction in CD\nat Mach 0.7.\nAt just below Mach 0.8, the flow typically enters the wake shock\nwave regime. This occurs at a slightly higher Mach number in\nDyment and Gryson [13]. Once the flow enters the wake shock wave\nregime, at just belowMach 0.8, the vortex formation region becomes\nelongated; a normal shock grows at the point of vortex roll up, and the\ndrag on the cylinder increases. This increase can be seen in Fig. 5. As\nthe flowmoves further into the wake shock regime at Mach 0.95,CD\nagain increases slightly and no vortex shedding is detected on the\nsurface of the cylinder.\nFigure 5 also highlights the discrepancy in CD between the two\nsets of results at Mach 0.6.

These differences are small, approximately 7\nand 5% of the overall CD at Mach 0.5 and 0.7, respectively, and can\nbe attributed to experimental error and the slight change in Reynolds\nnumber, as the Mach number has not yet increased sufficiently to\nremove all Reynolds number effects. However, at Mach 0.6 the\ndifference is 0.31; this is quite considerable when one recalls that at\nMach 0.4CD is 0.41, suggesting that there is a difference between the\nboundary-layer flows in the 2000 and 2002 series results.\nD. Pressure Distributions\nTo aid the investigation into the CD discrepancy, the 2000 series\npressure profiles are shown in Fig. 7 with the 2002 series profiles\nsuperimposed for Mach numbers of 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7.\n1. Base Pressure Data\nIn Fig. 7, at Mach 0.5, the 2002 series time-averaged surface\npressure distributions, denoted by open circles, follow closely the\n2000 series distributions from the upstream stagnation point\n(\u0001\u0005 0 deg) to an azimuthal angle of about 100 deg. In the range of\n100 deg \b \u0001 \b 130 deg, there is a greater static pressure recovery\nin the 2002 series data than in the 2000 series data. The difference\nindicates the presence of an early laminar separation in the 2000\nseries tests, whereas the separation in the 2002 series tests is delayed\nby about 10 deg of azimuth. This effect is more pronounced at Mach\n0.6 (Fig. 7), at which the flow separates at \u0001\t 90 deg, causing a\nreduction in base pressure that affects the entire leeward face\n(90 deg \b \u0001 \b 180 deg). This separation is accompanied by a\nlarger excursion between the minimum and maximum pressure\ncoefficients, indicated by the dashed lines. This is indicative of very\nstrong vortex shedding in the 2000 series tests. The Mach 0.7\npressure distribution (Fig. 7) also shows a greater pressure recovery\nat \u0001\t 95 deg for the 2002 series tests. This shows that for all three\nMach numbers the boundary layer at separation is mostly laminar\nwhereas the cylinder boundary layer during the 2002 series tests is\neither turbulent or undergoing transition at separation. This would\nlead to an irregularly fragmented separation line in the 2002 series, a\nfeature of the TrBL3 regime highlighted in Sec. III.C, as compared\nwith a more uniform separation and greater spanwise coherence in\nvortex shedding in the 2000 series. This produces the greater surface\npressure fluctuation amplitude recorded in the 2000 series test that is\nindicative of stronger shedding.\n2. Boundary-Layer Tripping\nThe tripping of the boundary layer into a turbulent or transitional\nstate may have happened in one of two ways. The first possibility is\nthat a change in the running conditions of the facility itself between\nthe two sets is the cause of the change. However, the freestream\nReynolds numbers for the 2000 and 2002 series tests are virtually\nidentical, at 6:86 \u0004 105 and 6:80 \u0004 105, respectively. Measurements\ntaken during the latter set of tests are thought to be those of a cylinder\nwith a tripped boundary layer. Tests of the freestream pressure\nfluctuations conducted on the facility indicate that the fitting of a new\ncontrol valve port ring shortly after the 2000 series tests actually\nFig. 7 Pressure distributions for the 2000 and 2002 series tests.\n2126 ACKERMAN ETAL.\nreduced the freestream turbulence by a small margin. This means\nthat, if the only changes between the tests are those to freestream\nconditions, the boundary layer should have been more laminar\nduring the 2002 series tests than in the 2000 series tests. Clearly, this\nis not the cause of the change in separation position and pressure\nrecovery between the two sets of data.\nThe second possibility is that the presence of four pressure\ntransducers positioned around the midspan of the cylinder in the\n2002 series of tests, shown in Fig. 2, may have tripped the boundary\nlayer. The 2000 test series only has a single transducer of smaller\ndiameter. The presence of the pressure transducers on the surface of\nthe cylinders presents flat spots, the transducer diaphragm making\nthe surface curvature discontinuous. Although this is minimized by\nfitting each transducer so that the face is flush with the upstream and\ndownstream edges of the mounting hole, discontinuities are inevita-\nbly formed, with the larger transducer creating the larger discon-\ntinuities. Because of the larger diaphragm diameter, the presence of\nthe transducers creates discontinuities in the surface curvature that\nare larger for the Entran transducers of the 2002 series.\n3. Shock\/Shear-Layer Interactions\nBy themselves, the discontinuities may or may not cause the\nboundary layer to become transitional or turbulent. However, when\none considers that the critical Mach number for a circular cylinder is\njust above 0.4, then at the higher Mach numbers of the 2002 series\nthese discontinuities may well cause the creation of local shock\nwaves that cause the boundary layer to trip. This is illustrated\nschematically in Fig. 8.During the 2000 series of tests, therewas only\none transducer on the cylinder surface and the discontinuity caused\nby it was small. This means that any alteration to the boundary layer\nas a result of shock waves stemming from this small discontinuity\noccurred after the flow had passed over the transducer. Because any\neffect this has on theflow is not easily communicated upstreamdue to\nthe flow being sonic, the readings taken are effectively those of a\nlaminar boundary layer with shock-induced laminar separation.\nThis was not the case for the 2002 series of tests. The windward-\nfacing transducers on the cylinder used for the 2002 series tests\nensure that the flow seen by the leeward transducers would always be\ntripped, even with the four pressure transducers placed at an\nazimuthal position other than the symmetric 45 deg orientation\nshown in Fig. 2. Thus, the leeward readings are all of a tripped\nboundary layer with shock-induced turbulent separation. Given that\nthe cylinder wake is mostly determined by the location of flow\nseparation, the flow asymmetry caused by the rotation of the four\npressure transducers in the 2002 series tests should be less of an\ninfluence on the aerodynamic loads compared with the location of\nflow separation. Therefore, as long as the boundary layer is tripped\nupstream of its separation point, the main flow wake should be\nessentially insensitive to the rotation of the four pressure transducers.\nIt would seem, then, that the most likely cause of the differences in\nCD and CBD between the series of tests is the presence of dis-\ncontinuities in the surface curvature due to the extra transducers.\nAlthough this means that the exact flow conditions for the two sets of\nresults differ, it also means that data exist for vortex shedding from a\ncircular cylinder with both a purely laminar boundary layer and a\ntripped turbulent or transitional boundary layer. This should be borne\nin mind during the subsequent discussion of the results.\nDespite the differences between the drag coefficients and base\ndrag coefficients taken from the 2000 and 2002 series, both sets\ndisplay the same trend. As the vortex shedding becomes established,\nat Mach 0.5 and 0.6, there is a significant rise inCD andCBD. Above\nMach 0.6, the coefficients fall off at Mach 0.7 and then, in the case of\nCD, rise slowly; in the case of CBD, they fall slowly. The large\ndifference between the coefficients atMach 0.6 andMach 0.7may be\nattributed to the change in flow regime from intermittent shock wave\nto permanent shock wave at around Mach 0.65. Given that the\ncoefficients do not change much after Mach 0.7, it can be deduced\nthat the change in the coefficients betweenMach 0.6 and 0.7 is due to\nthe flow around the cylinder containing supersonic regions through-\nout the vortex-shedding cycle. The slight changes after Mach 0.7 are\ndue to delayed separation and greater pressure recovery.\n4. Surface Pressure Fluctuations\nAnother point of difference between the two sets of data is the rms\nlevels of the phase-averaged and rawCP atMach 0.6. The 2000 series\nresults have a notable drop in the level of the rms between the raw and\nphase-averaged data, which does not occur in the 2002 series data for\nMach 0.6 shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The cause of this is the use of wake\npressure readings as a phase reference during the 2000 series results.\nAlthough thewake readings do provide a reasonable phase reference,\nthere is a greater level of jitter in the wake pressure reading than in\nthose readings taken on the cylinder surface. This has the effect of\nslightly smearing the phase-averaged data, resulting in a lower rms of\nthe fluctuations; some of the fluctuation feeds into the variance of the\nphase average in the data processing. This means that, although the\n2000 series phase-averaged CP are valid data, they are not of such\nhigh quality as the 2002 data. Specifically, in the 2000 series data,\nsome of the physical rms fluctuation due to the flow unsteadiness\nfeeds instead into the variance of the phase locked average in the data\nprocessing.\nAnother flow feature that shows up clearly in Fig. 7 is the drop in\nthe level of pressure fluctuation on the windward side, forward of\naround the 60 deg azimuth, as theMach number increases. Inspection\nof Figs. 3 and 4 shows that this is generally true from Mach 0.5\nupward. It is caused by the strengthening of the intermittent and,\neventually, permanent supersonic regions on the surface of the\ncylinder along with the attendant surface shockwaves up to thewake\nshock waves regime. The presence of supersonic regions prevents\npressure fluctuations from being communicated upstream during the\nhalf period that it is not supersonic; this results in sizable surface\npressure perturbations. Thus, in the intermittent shock wave regime\nduring the first half of the shedding cycle, the pressure fluctuations\ncanmove forward over one half of the surface and, during the second,\nthey can move forward over the other half. The ability to prevent the\nfluctuations from moving forward is dependent on the size of the\nsupersonic regions and, therefore, increases with the freestream\nMach number as these regions grow.\n5. Isentropic Mach Number Distributions\nThe cessation of pressure fluctuations over the windward side of\nthe cylinder at Mach 0.7 indicates that localized areas of supersonic\nflow are, or are nearly, permanent. This is evidenced in Fig. 9; at\nMach 0.6, the time-averaged isentropic Mach number reaches a\nmaximum just above unity and remains there. This indicates that the\nintermittent shock waves are indeed present for only half of a vortex-\nshedding cycle, allowing the movement upstream of pressure\nfluctuations during the half of the vortex-shedding cycle that is not\nsupersonic, resulting in sizable surface pressure fluctuations. At\nMach 0.6, the maximum isentropic Mach number about the leeward\nsurface appears to reach a very high value at some points. Low values\nof surface static pressure are observed, but the very high apparent\nisentropic Mach numbers are an artifact of the data reduction\nprocedures.\nAt Mach 0.7, the time-averaged isentropic Mach number\naccelerates to well above unity, indicating that the flow on both\nsides of the cylinder remains supersonic for a significant proportion\nof the time. While the flow on both sides of the cylinder is sonic,\nthere can be no, or in practice very little, communication of pressure\nfluctuations upstream, thus reducing the maximum and minimum\ninflow turbulent\nflat\nshock\nexpansion fan\nlaminar\nlayer\nFig. 8 Schematic representation of the effects of the pressure\ntransducer on the boundary layer.\nACKERMAN ETAL. 2127\nlevels of isentropic Mach number on the windward face. This is\nshown in Fig. 9 by a reduction in the width of the region delimited\nby the maximum and minimum isentropic Mach numbers, in the\nrange of 0 deg \b \u0001 \b 60 deg, as the Mach number increases from\n0.6 to 0.7.\nE. Vortex Formation and Shedding\n1. Shedding Frequency\nThe changes in flow features and vortex-shedding mechanisms\ncan be seen from the changes in vortex-shedding frequency with\nfreestream velocity and Mach number, Fig. 10a. From Gerrard [14],\nthe shedding frequency may be viewed as the result of a balance\nbetween the size of the formation region and the thickness and state\nof the shear layers feeding into it. Figure 10a shows that the rate of\nincrease in the fundamental vortex-shedding frequency between\nMach 0.6 and 0.8 remains linear. Above Mach 0.8, the rate of\nincrease in vortex-shedding frequency with freestream velocity\nincreases and, belowMach 0.6, initially decreases and then increases\ndown to Mach 0.4. This seems to indicate that either the amount of\nfluid entrained into each vortex remains the same throughout the\nMach 0.6\u20130.8 range or the rate of entrainment and the amount offluid\nentrained changes in such a way as to create a linear increase in\nshedding frequency. BelowMach 0.6 and aboveMach 0.8, either the\namount of fluid entrained per vortex changes nonlinearly, or the rate\nof entrainment changes nonlinearly, or both. The nonlinear increase\nin shedding frequency atMach 0.5 is further explored by considering\nthe possibility of flow\/acoustic coupling in the wind-tunnel test\nsection. The tunnel acoustic modes closest to the vortex-shedding\nfrequency are the second transversal mode at 892 Hz and the\ncomposite of the first transversal mode and the sixth flow-normal\nmode at 804 Hz. These acoustic modes are rather remote from the\nvortex-shedding frequency at Mach 0.5, so that flow\/acoustic\ncoupling is unlikely to have occurred at Mach 0.5.\nThe apparently linear increase in shedding frequency between\nMach 0.6 and 0.8 is interesting as, in this Mach number range, the\nflow regime changes twice, from intermittent shock waves to\npermanent shock waves and then to wake shock waves, although the\nfinal change in regime has only just occurred at Mach 0.8. The\nformation of vortices, the subsequent increase, up until just over\nMach 0.6, and then reduction in their strength and the increase in\nfrequency at which they are shed is very complex and dependent on a\nnumber of variables.\nA possible reason for the cessation of the linear increase in shed-\nding frequency aboveMach 0.8 can be found in theflowvisualization\nof Dyment and Gryson [13]. From their flow visualization at Mach\n0.8 and 0.9, the vortex formation region can be seen to lengthen by\naround two-and-a-half times. This suggests that when the permanent\nshock wave regime first appears there is initially little change in the\nformation of the vortices.\nAs the flowmoves further into the regime, the differences between\nit and the intermittent shock wave regime become more apparent as\nthe flow features become stronger. Accordingly it seems reasonable\nto expect the nonlinear increase in shedding frequency to be related to\nthe extension of the vortex formation region. Above Mach 0.9, the\nvortex formation becomes yet more complex as the shear layers start\nto converge, causing the vortex formation region to thin. However, as\nnoted next, at this Mach number it is impossible to determine the\nStrouhal number from surface pressure measurements and so the\nchanges here are unknown.\n2. Frequency Spectra\nThe fundamental shedding frequencies are taken from frequency\nspectra of the data created using MATLAB\u2019s\u00ae psd function. A\nsample of these for eachMach number, taken at an azimuth of around\n85 deg, is given in Fig. 11.\nIt is worth noting that there is very little difference in the vortex-\nshedding frequencies found in the 2000 and 2002 series of tests. For\nexample, at Mach 0.6, at which the biggest differences between the\ntwo series are found, the vortex-shedding frequencies are 928 and\n944Hz for the 2000 and 2002 series results, respectively, a difference\nof just 16 Hz or 1.7%. At Mach 0.5 and 0.7, the differences between\nthe two series are 18 Hz or 2.1% and 30 Hz or 2.7%, respectively.\nThis indicates that, although the difference in boundary-layer state\ndoes have some effect on the vortex-shedding frequency, it is very\nsmall.\nIt should also be noted that at the Reynolds number used in these\ntests there should be no vortex shedding at all when the flow is fully\nsubsonic, as it falls into the TrBL3 regime [11]. Indeed, from a quick\ninspection of the frequency spectra for Mach 0.4, it appears that this\nis the case. However, a closer inspection of the data reveals that there\nis a broad increase in the power spectrum magnitude in the region of\nFig. 9 Isentropic Mach number distribution for 2000 series results.\n2128 ACKERMAN ETAL.\naround 550\u2013670 Hz at azimuths of around 80\u201390 deg. Also, a closer\ninspection of the time-resolved data, from around 80 to 90 deg,\nindicates occasional sinusoidal fluctuations with wavelengths that\nmatch this broad frequency range. From this it is inferred that there is\nweak intermittent shedding of vortices at this Mach number. The\nReynolds number used is very near the upper boundary of the TrBL2\nflow regime, within which vortex shedding does occur. Furthermore,\nthe authors have ample evidence of vortex shedding occurring\nbehind turbine blades under these conditions and much further into\nthe transonic regime [3].\nAt Mach 0.5, the fundamental vortex-shedding mode is accom-\npanied by two harmonics with about a 20 dB logarithmic decrement\nper octave, whereas, at Mach 0.6 and 0.7 there are just the funda-\nmental vortex-shedding mode and one harmonic. The presence of a\nhigher number of harmonics at Mach 0.5 correlates with the\nnonlinear variation of the Strouhal number over this Mach number\nrange, observed in Fig. 10b, confirming the greater complexity of the\nfluid dynamic instability at this Mach number.\n3. Strouhal Number\nThe frequency data are too sparse to fit a curve that allows for the\nnonlinear behavior with changing Mach number. However, further\ninsight can be gained into the behavior of the vortex-shedding\nfrequency through inspection of the nondimensionalized vortex-\nshedding frequency, the Strouhal number. When plotted against the\nMach number, as in Fig. 10b, the changes in Strouhal number\nconfirm the indications given by the changes of shedding frequency\nregarding the shedding mechanisms. This is because, as well as\nnormalizing the data with respect to the cylinder diameter and\nfreestream velocity, the Strouhal number is also the product of the\nfirst derivative of shedding frequency with respect to freestream\nvelocity and the cylinder diameter. Thus, any change in the rate of\nincrease of the fundamental vortex-shedding frequency with the\nfreestream velocity becomes clear when the Strouhal number is\nplotted against the Mach number.\nAs the Mach number increases from 0.4 to 0.5 the Strouhal\nnumber, St, rises from 0.182 to 0.192 as the intermittent shock wave\nregime is established. St then falls off significantly from around 0.19\ndown to about 0.176 between Mach 0.5 and 0.6 as the local\nsupersonic regions become stronger. The Strouhal number then\nremains fairly constant through the intermittent shock wave and\npermanent shock wave regimes, confirming the linear increase of\nshedding frequency in this region, before increasing to 0.217 atMach\n0.9 as the wake shock wave regime strengthens.\nThese findings are supported by the circular cylinder results of\nMurthy andRose [15] and theflat platework ofHeinemann et al. [16]\nthat are plotted alongside the results of the 2000 and 2002 series tests.\nThe results from Murthy and Rose are broadly similar to those from\nthese tests, although they do not show an increase in Strouhal number\nat Mach 0.5. They do report that their findings at Mach 0.4 show a\nbroadband increase in the frequency spectra, indicating that they had\nFig. 10 Vortex-shedding frequency across the experimental range: a) fundamental shedding frequency as a function of freestream velocity, and\nb)Strouhal numberover theReynoldsnumber rangeof 0:83 \u0002 105 < Re> 5 \u0002 105.Open symbols:Murthy andRose [15],flatplate:Heinemannet al. [16].\nACKERMAN ETAL. 2129\nsimilar results to these but interpreted them differently. It is also\ninteresting that at high Mach numbers Murthy and Rose found that\nthe Strouhal number could either rise or fall. This would indicate that\nthe vortex shedding at this Mach number is unstable, confirming the\nfindings of Carscallen et al. [3]. Thework of Heinemann et al. [16] is\npresented by way of comparison between thewake flow of flat plates\n(and, by extension, airfoils and the blades of turbines and compres-\nsors) and that of circular cylinders. Although it is clear from the\npatterns formed by the different sets of data that the flow regimes for\nthe two types of flow have different limits, this is to be expected\ngiven the low critical Mach number of circular cylinders. Regardless\nof the differences, the similarity between the two sets of data is\nencouraging.\nAnother point of interest is that from the data in Fig. 10b there is\nlittle difference in the Strouhal number from the data taken at\ndifferent Reynolds numbers but the same Mach number. This indi-\ncates that, once the flow around a circular cylinder has become\ncritical, the Reynolds number ceases to be amajor determining factor\nin the flow. It is also interesting to note that few Strouhal number data\nare given in the literature for Mach numbers above 0.9. Although\nZdravkovich [11] states that no vortex shedding is found aboveMach\n0.9, the flow visualization [13] that he used at Mach 0.95 indicates\nthat vortex shedding does occur up to that Mach number. The 2000\nseries surface pressuremeasurements atMach 0.95 show no periodic\nfluctuation. This can be seen from the low rms level and maximum\nand minimum pressures at Mach 0.95 in Fig. 3. The salient feature is\nthat at Mach 0.95 a strong oblique shock forms at the confluence of\nthe free shear layers from which the vortices are formed and shed\n[13]. It seems likely, then, that the supersonic region of flow\nresponsible for this shock prevents pressure fluctuations from\nmoving upstream to the cylinder surface where they could be\ndetected.\nF. Summary\nIn summary, it may be said that, at Mach numbers above 0.6, the\nbase drag and drag coefficients begin to fall with increasing Mach\nnumber until theflowenters thewake shockwave regime.Once there,\nthe drag and the base drag coefficients begin to rise again. In a similar\nvein, the Strouhal number remains approximately constant from\nMach 0.6 up to Mach 0.8, at which the wake shock wave regime\nbegins. It would seem, then, that the mechanism responsible for the\nformation of large scale vortices downstream of the cylinder remains\nthe same through the intermittent shock wave and permanent shock\nwave regimes but that, once the steadier near wake of thewake shock\nwave regime is established, the mechanism changes, leading to\nincreased base drag, despite an increase in pressure recovery.\nThe change inmechanism can be seen from the change in behavior\nof the time-resolved data both in the time and frequency domains.\nAlthough the magnitude of the pressure coefficient fluctuations\naround the surface of the cylinder fall in the Mach number range of\n0.5\u20130.7, the behavior remains the same. The behavior then changes at\nMach 0.8. This is marked by a sudden clearing up of the signal,\naccompanied by a significant drop in the surface pressure fluctuation\namplitude. The new behavior, as described in Sec. III.C, indicates a\nchange of mechanism. This is characterized by the disappearance of\nFig. 11 Frequency spectra of surface pressure results taken at azimuths of 83.21 deg (2000 series) and 84.21 deg (2002 series).\n2130 ACKERMAN ETAL.\nanypressurefluctuations on thewindward face of the cylinder, that is,\nbefore separation, and an increasingly sharp rise in the frequency\ncontent during and after separation, indicating a reduction in the\nmovement of the separation shocks.\nThe results also show that the state of the boundary layer before\nseparation has little effect on the drag and base drag coefficients\nexcept at Mach 0.6. A possible explanation for this is the strength of\nthe intermittent shock wave regime at Mach 0.6. Below this Mach\nnumber, the regime is still establishing itself and, above it, it is\neradicated by the formation of the permanent shock wave regime.\nMach 0.6 is where the difference in the boundary-layer state has the\ngreatest effect on the flow immediately before, during, and just after\nseparation, resulting in the greatest, and indeed only significant,\ndifference between the values of drag measured for the two series of\ntests. Itwould seem, then, that themechanism for the formation of the\nvortices has a very significant impact on the base drag of the cylinder.\nIV. Conclusions\nTime-resolved pressure distributions give information on the\nlocation and strength of surface pressure fluctuations on a circular\ncylinder in crossflow over the subsonic speed range. The corre-\nsponding drag and base drag coefficients are presented. Data on\nStrouhal number variation over the subsonic speed range are also\nprovided and are compared with measurements by other authors.\nMeasurements have been collected in two measurement cam-\npaigns, in which the instrumentation changed from a single surface\npressure transducer mounted on the cylinder midspan in the 2000\nseries to four surface pressure transducers evenly spaced around the\ncircumference at midspan in the 2002 series. As a result, sets of data\nhave inadvertently been producedwithout andwith a boundary-layer\ntrip.\nThe state of the boundary layer on the cylinder surface influences\nthe vortex shedding. Specifically, the disturbance introduced by the\npresence of the upstream pressure transducers in the 2002 series is\nthought to promote an early transition, leading to a turbulent bound-\nary layer that is more tolerant of the adverse pressure gradient on the\ncylinder leeward surface; this delays boundary-layer separation. As a\nresult, the thickness of the wake and the size of the vortex formation\nregion are reduced and the Strouhal number is affected.\nConsequently, the crossflow about a circular cylinder changes\nsignificantly at higher subsonic velocities and into the transonic\nrange. The flow regime changes a number of times, resulting in a\nlarger excursion between the minimum and maximum pressure\ncoefficients. This is indicative of very strong vortex shedding in the\n2000 series tests. The changing strength of the vortices can also be\nseen, at Mach numbers above 0.6, to reduce the base pressure deficit\nand, hence, the drag coefficient up to aMach number of 0.9, at which\nthe onset of permanent sonic flow increases the drag acting on the\ncylinder. At this higher Mach number, a normal shock develops\nacross the wake downstream of the cylinder that becomes the\nlocation of the onset of disturbances at Mach 0.9. As vortices form\ndownstream of the normal shock, their pressure perturbation cannot\ntravel upstream through the supersonic flow toward the circular\ncylinder surface, where the surface pressure fluctuation amplitude is\nattenuated with respect to that atMach numbers between 0.5 and 0.8.\nThis paper has concentrated on providing some detailed data on\npressure fluctuations rather than attempting to produce universal\ncorrelations. It was considered more important to provide detailed\ninformation and physical explanations of the various configuration\nchanges when possible. This should be of assistance in eventually\nproviding a more general model of vortex shedding on a circular\ncylinder in crossflow over the subsonic range and its effects on\nparameters such as base pressure.\nAcknowledgments\nA research grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council is gratefully acknowledged.
