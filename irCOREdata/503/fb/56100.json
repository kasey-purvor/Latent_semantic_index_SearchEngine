Benham, F. M. McEvoy and K. E. Rollin \n \nAbstract \nThis study provides an assessment of the potential for stratiform massive sulphide mineralisation in two parts of south-west \nEngland, the Central Area between Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor, and North Devon. The Central Area was selected on the basis of \nits tectonic, stratigraphical and lithological similarities with the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) where numerous volcanogenic massive \nsulphide (VMS) deposits occur. North Devon is considered prospective on account of its similarities to the Harz Massif in \nGermany that hosts the major polymetallic sedimentary exhalative (Sedex) deposit at Rammelsberg. More than 60 stratiform \nmineral occurrences are known in the two areas and previous exploration, including extensive drainage geochemical surveys, \ngeophysical surveying and drilling, has revealed stratiform mineralisation at some localities, including at Egloskerry, near Bodmin \nMoor, where up to 10% Pb over 4.5 metres was recorded.  In North Devon, stratiform mineralisation has been recorded from a \nborehole at Honeymead Farm, and further evidence of potential is provided by a distinct aeromagnetic anomaly parallel to the \nregional strike over the upland areas of Exmoor. \nThe potential for the occurrence of stratiform sulphide deposits in North Devon and the Central Area has been assessed by GIS-\nbased prospectivity analysis software, Arc-Spatial Data Modeller (Arc-SDM), using knowledge-driven and data-driven modelling \ntechniques. This analysis used both new and legacy multivariate datasets including geophysics (aeromagnetic and gravity), \ngeochemical data, mineral occurrences, and digital 1:50 000 geological linework. This has confirmed known occurrences as well \nas identifying new targets for stratiform mineralisation. Zones of high prospectivity in the Central Area occur along the northern \nedges of Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor, in the intervening ground underlain by Lower Carboniferous strata, and in the Lower \nCarboniferous strata on the eastern side of Dartmoor. In North Devon prospective areas were identified at a number of localities in \nthe Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous strata, with the highest potential occurring along strike from Combe Martin near \nHoneymead Farm. \n \nAntony Benham (for correspondence, abenham@bgs.ac.uk), and Fiona McEvoy (fmcevoy@bgs.ac.uk) are Economic Geologists \nat the British Geological Survey, Keyworth, Nottingham, NG12 5GG, UK. Keith Rollin formerly worked as a Principal \nGeophysicist at the BGS.  \nKeywords: Stratiform massive sulphide, prospectivity analysis, south-west England \n \nIntroduction \nSouth-west England (Figure 1) has a long history of metal mining from pre-Roman times. The main products were tin and copper, \nwith subordinate lead, zinc, silver, arsenic, antimony, sulphur, iron and manganese. Over 1500 named mines are recorded in the \nregion 13. Most produced cassiterite and\/or chalcopyrite from hydrothermal quartz veins and stockworks in, or close to, the \nHercynian granites. However, not all the exploited mineralisation was of lode type; modern ore deposit models have permitted re-\nexamination of the former mining districts in relation to a variety of deposit types and commodities.  \nThis study is aimed at assessing the potential for the discovery of stratiform massive sulphide mineral deposits in two areas using \nGIS-based prospectivity analysis. The area between Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor, the Central Area (Figure 1), was selected for \nstudy because it has known occurrences of stratiform mineralisation and because it provides a broad geological analogy with the \nIberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) of southern Spain and Portugal where major deposits of this type have been worked for many centuries \n21. In the second study area in northern Devon (Figure 1), a thick shallow-marine Devonian sequence occurs that is comparable to \nthe Harz Massif in Germany which hosts the major polymetallic sulphide deposits at Rammelsberg 19.  \n 2\nProspectivity analysis involves the analysis of multiple digital datasets such as geophysics, geochemistry and geology that are \nintegrated into a single prospectivity map that identifies favourable areas for new deposits based upon the parameters of a \nparticular mineral deposit model. In 2001, Rollin et al. undertook a preliminary prospectivity analysis for stratiform base-metal \nsulphides in south-west England 29. This study focused on Devon and east Cornwall and involved the use of 1:250 000 digital \ngeology and a BGS-developed prospectivity-modelling package known as XMAP.  \nThe present investigation concerns two areas that are regarded as favourable for the occurrence of stratiform base-metal sulphide \ndeposits (Figure 1): the Central Area, located between the Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor granites, and the North Devon area, \nlocated along the north Devon coast extending into Somerset and inland as far as Barnstaple. This present study utilises an \nimproved prospectivity methodology, the Spatial Data Modeller tool used with Arcview (Arc-SDM). It also uses new data \nintegrated with legacy data within a framework provided by modern published mineral deposit models for stratiform base-metal \nsulphide deposits. The key items of data incorporated into the new prospectivity analysis are: legacy aeromagnetic data digitised \nand interpreted with new procedures, revised geological models and new digital 1:50 000 geological data, new drainage \ngeochemistry data, and mine and mineral occurrence data held in the BGS Mineral Occurrence Database (MOD).  \nGeology \nSouth-west England has a complex geological history and the region lies in the outer and northernmost zone of the Variscan \norogen, the Rhenohercynian terrane. The nature of the basement to the Rhenohercynian zone is uncertain: in the north a series of \nstacked thrusts that have affected Devonian and Carboniferous strata probably rest on a basement that is part of the Avalonian \nterrane (Figure 1). The most southerly point in the south-west is the Lizard peninsula, a fragment of Devonian oceanic floor of \nmainly ultrabasic rocks, most of which have been altered to serpentinite. This may be linked to the Start series of schists and \ngneisses (in Devon) by a series of thrusts and marks the edge of the Amorican Terrane. \nLower Devonian sedimentary rocks in the Central Area are separated from those in North Devon by a broad zone of fine-grained \nsedimentary Carboniferous rocks (the Culm Basin) in central Devon (Figure 1). In the south-west of the basin, the Lower \nCarboniferous succession consists of a thin sequence of black shales, calcareous mudrock and bedded chert, with some tuffs and \nspilitic lavas. The Upper Carboniferous is a thick succession of interbedded turbidite sandstones and mudrocks known as the Culm \nMeasures. These rocks have undergone low-grade metamorphism and Variscan deformation; they underlie most of Devon and \nCornwall to the north of the Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor granites. \nCentral Area \nThe large granitic bodies of Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor dominate the Central Area (Figure 1). These were emplaced over an \ninterval of approximately 30 Ma commencing at the Permian-Carboniferous boundary and they form part of the Cornubian \nbatholith that extends from Dartmoor through Cornwall to the Isles of Scilly 33. The economic importance of these rocks is well \nknown due to their association with mineral deposits that have been exploited since pre-Roman times.   \nThe geology between the Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor granites is composed of a complex series of parautochthonous and \nallochthonous sequences of Carboniferous and Middle and Upper Devonian sandstones and slates that have been thrust northwards \ninto nappes during the Variscan orogeny (Figure 1). Within these nappes and the parautochthon there are more than 30 named \nformations spanning the stages from Famennian to Namurian including many formations with black shale members and cherts. \nStratiform manganese silicate-carbonate mineralisation derived from contemporaneous submarine hydrothermal activity occur \nwithin the chert beds. \nThe central belt between Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor includes prospective host formations for stratiform sulphide deposits in both \nparautochthonous and allochthonous sequences. Commercial drilling near Egloskerry (Figure 2) in rocks of Late Devonian to \nEarly Carboniferous age identified stratiform lead-zinc mineralisation 16. \n 3\nNorth Devon \nIn North Devon (Figure 1) transitions between marine and non-marine conditions dominate the stratigraphy. The Middle to Late \nDevonian boundary occurs above a sequence of fluvial and deltaic sandstones, within a marine sequence dominated by shales or \nmudstones, with thin limestone beds in the lowest part. The thickness of the sandstone and shale units is difficult to measure due to \nstructural repetition and the lack of zonal fossils, but some formations in the area are in excess of several hundreds of metres. The \noldest strata exposed belong to the marine Lynton Formation (Figure 3). These are conformably overlain by the Hangman \nSandstone Formation that marks a major regressive and transgressive event. This formation is in turn is overlain by the Ilfracombe \nSlate Formation (subdivided by later BGS mapping into the Kentisbury Slates Member, the Lester Slates and Sandstones Member, \nand the Wild Pear Slates Member).  \nIn the Combe Martin district the Ilfracombe Slate Formation contains lead-zinc-silver deposits that provided the basis of the \nhistoric mining industry in that area 32. The mines probably date back to the 13th century 9 and have been closed and re-opened \nseveral times since, with production finally ceasing in the 1940s. Along strike to the east, drilling at approximately the same \nstratigraphic level at Honeymead Farm (Figure 3) identified disseminated Fe-sulphide (pyrrhotite) mineralisation beneath Exmoor \n14. \n \nPrevious investigations for stratiform base-metal sulphide deposits \nExtensive exploration activity, ranging from regional reconnaissance surveys to detailed investigations, has been carried out in \nboth areas of study. The DTI-funded Mineral Reconnaissance Programme (MRP), carried out by the BGS from 1971\u20131996, \nproduced 37 reports and data releases related to south-west England. In addition there are 51 reports on commercial exploration \nwork carried out under the Mineral Exploration and Investment Grant Act (MEIGA) that operated from 1971-1984. The BGS \n1:10 000 scale mapping programme and associated regional gravity and aeromagnetic surveys 6, 7 also provide a large amount of \nrelevant data that underpins exploration and assessment of the mineral resources in the region. The most recent study related to \nbase-metal mineralisation assessed the potential for the occurrence of stratiform base-metal sulphide mineralisation in Devon and \neast Cornwall using knowledge-based prospectivity analysis 29. \nCentral Area \nRegional reconnaissance geophysical surveys carried out by BGS in the 1950s identified a prominent high frequency aeromagnetic \nanomaly in the central area of Devon and east Cornwall 7 which approximately follows the mapped outcrop of Lower \nCarboniferous strata along the northern margins of the Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor granites (Figure 2). The form of the magnetic \nanomaly indicates that its source has a strong Natural Remnant Magnetisation (NRM) vector. The most important ferromagnetic \nmineral in the area was shown to be pyrrhotite that has a Curie temperature in the range 270\u2013330\u00b0 C. The pyrrhotite appears to \nhave been formed at about the time of granite intrusion, either by metasomatism 10 or by recrystallisation of syngenetic pyrite 3.  \nA strong geochemical soil anomaly was identified in 1981 by RioFinex at Egloskerry, two miles west of Launceston, Cornwall \n(Figure 2). Anomalous Pb values in soils, in excess of 4000 ppm, occurred at two localities that were subsequently drilled. Zinc, \nand to a lesser extent Cu and Mn, were also enriched at these sites. In one borehole significant lead mineralisation was intersected \nwith 10% Pb over 4.5 m (4.1 m true thickness) in a 45 m thick laminated siltstone unit forming part of the Lower Carboniferous \nvolcano-sedimentary sequence. Other boreholes in the area intersected 1-2% combined Pb and Zn over 1-2 m. \nIn the Bovey Tracey area of east Dartmoor (Figure 2), MRP drilling investigated geophysical anomalies associated with clusters of \nsoil geochemical anomalies 2. This identified disseminated and thin, discontinuous stratabound veinlets of sulphides in shales, \ncherts and tuffs close to the Lower\u2013Upper Carboniferous boundary. Galena and sphalerite with minor chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite \n 4\nand loellingite are associated with pyrite, quartz and siderite. Chemical analysis of this drillcore revealed high Zn values in some \nsections, one containing 2% Zn over 3 m. Finely disseminated galena and sphalerite had not been reported previously from the \nTeign Valley and their discovery indicated potential for this type of deposit in the condensed Lower Carboniferous sequence of \nthis district. The results of these and other investigations carried out in this area are summarised in Table 1.  \nNorth Devon \nDrainage geochemical surveys over Exmoor and the Brendon Hills (Figure 1) carried out by the MRP in the mid-late 1980s \nidentified several areas of anomalous Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, Sb, and Ba 17. Some of these anomalies relate to vein-style mineralisation, \nbut others may reflect stratiform base-metal and barytes mineralisation. \nRegional aeromagnetic surveys carried out by the BGS in the 1950s identified a distinct aeromagnetic anomaly with an amplitude \nof about 60 nT trending west-north-west\u2013east-south-east over the upland areas of Exmoor approximately following the boundary \nbetween the Ilfracombe Slates and the Morte Slates (Figure 3). A less prominent linear anomaly to the south occurs over the upper \npart of the Morte Slates, with maximum amplitudes in the west. Detailed soil geochemical studies over the aeromagnetic \nanomalies identified minor Zn-Pb enrichments in some areas and a general association of Zn in soil with the magnetic anomaly 17. \nAt the site of one of these anomalies, Honeymead Farm (approximately 25 km south-east of Combe Martin), two boreholes were \ndrilled as part of the BGS mapping programme 14. These identified pyrrhotite mineralisation in the form of disseminations on the \ncleavage faces as well as pyrite occurring as fine disseminations in sandstones, with calcite in tension gashes and minor veins.  \nThe results of the principal investigations carried out in this area are summarised in Table 1. \n \nProspectivity Analysis \nMineral deposit models are syntheses of large amounts of data that provide an essentially qualitative basis for exploration and \nresource assessment. Such models can be used to identify the key exploration criteria for a particular type of deposit and thus form \nthe basis for analysis of the mineral potential of a region. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have become the standard \nplatform in mineral exploration to coordinate and manage these datasets. GIS facilitates the querying and analysis of the data to \ndetermine which parameters are critical or subsidiary to the mineralisation process and allows the structured integration and \nmodelling of these often-voluminous datasets to look for patterns and associations that may otherwise not be apparent. Data \nintegration models in GIS are divided into two categories, data-driven models (Weights of Evidence modelling and logistic \nregression) and knowledge-driven models (Fuzzy Logic and neural network)5. Data-driven approaches such as Weights of \nEvidence are probability-based techniques for mapping mineral potential using the spatial distribution of known mineral \noccurrences. The approach aims to relate or \u2018train\u2019 all specified datasets to known occurrences of the particular deposit type within \nthe region and, by association, highlight those data relationships which closely mimic the patterns at the known occurrences. \nWeights are estimated from the measured association between known occurrences and the values on the maps to be used as \npredictors. The output of Weights of Evidence modelling is a map of posterior probability, or the degree to which each pixel \nresembles one or more of the training points (the known occurrences).   \nWeights of Evidence modelling has been applied to variety of deposit types worldwide including favourability mapping for \nvolcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits in Manitoba 43, porphyry copper deposits in northern Iran 35, tin-tungsten-uranium \nmineralisation in Nova Scotia 41, and diamond exploration at Lac de Gras, Northwest Territories 42.  \nKnowledge-driven analyses establish the relationship between the spatial exploration datasets and the exploration model and are \noften employed in regions without known mineral occurrences with which to \u2018train\u2019 the exploration datasets.  Knowledge-driven \ntechniques such as Fuzzy Logic are subjective in that the \u2018explorationist\u2019 determines the relative significance of the exploration \ndatasets and assigns a significance weighting based on the exploration model. Knowledge-based prospectivity mapping is \n 5\nachieved by extracting the spatial relationships from exploration datasets on the basis of the exploration model, quantifying these \nspatial relationships and integrating them using mathematical operators chosen by the user. The output of Fuzzy Logic modelling \nis a map of mineral potential. This can be directly compared with the posterior probability map generated by the Weights of \nEvidence model allowing the user to compare the utility of each model for a particular study. Fuzzy Logic prospectivity analysis \nhas been applied over a number of different deposit types throughout the world, examples being Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) \nmineralisation 12, porphyry copper deposits in northern Iran 36, and orogenic gold deposits in the Yilgarn Block, Western Australia \n15.  \nVarious techniques can be applied to generate mineral potential maps within a GIS environment. Arc-Spatial Data Modeller \n(SDM) software 18, developed by the United States Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada, provides the ability \nto conduct both data-driven and knowledge-driven analysis. All these methods combine two or more evidential themes to generate \na response theme that is a map that predicts favourable locations for mineral deposit occurrences.  \nProspectivity analysis is based on a general series of procedures, which can be grouped into five key stages: \n1) A review of the mineral deposit model; \n2) Determination of the key exploration indicators from the mineral deposit model; \n3) Review of dataset availability for the area under investigation, data processing, interpretation and analysis to extract \nthe key indicators; \n4) Assignment of weightings, zones and styles of influence to key indicators (expert parameterisation); and  \n5) Calculation of prospectivity using knowledge-driven or data-driven methods \nFor a detailed explanation of the mathematics underlying both Weights of Evidence and Fuzzy Logic the reader is referred to \nBonham-Carter 5.   \n \nMineral Deposit Models and Key Exploration Criteria \nExploration criteria are defined on the basis of mineral deposit models built from a knowledge of similar deposits world-wide, \nmodified by specific features of any known local mineralisation in the area being assessed. The degree of confidence and value \nthat can be attached to the prospectivity maps depends on the availability, quality and relevance of the data, together with the \nreliability of the exploration model.  \n \nRollin et al. identified many geological similarities between the Central Area between Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor and the Iberian \nPyrite Belt (IPB) in southern Spain and Portugal, where numerous VMS deposits occur 29. They also compared the geological \nenvironment of the Exmoor district to the setting of the major Sedex-type polymetallic sulphide deposit at Rammelsberg in \nGermany. Exploration criteria for both deposit types include essential general parameters and specific local features which \ncontribute to favourability. Many essential parameters for both deposit classes are present, although the extent and distribution of \nmany are poorly known. \n \nIPB-type model and parameters \nVMS deposits form on or close to the seafloor from venting metal-rich solutions. They occur in a range of tectonic settings \ncharacterised by the presence of submarine volcanic rocks. Mineralisation typically occurs in a volcanosedimentary succession \nthat includes bimodal piles of rhyolite-basalt lavas, tuffs and breccias with varying quantities of interbedded clastic sediments, \ncommonly fine-grained (mudstones) ocean-floor deposits.  The IPB is the largest accumulation of VMS mineralisation in the \nworld with more than 80 known deposits containing sulphide resources (ore mined and reserves) in excess of 1700 Mt totalling 4.6 \n 6\nMt Cu, 13 Mt Pb, 34.9 Mt Zn as well as substantial tonnages of Au and Ag 21. The IPB mineralisation is dominated by pyrite and \nthe VMS deposits typically comprise a concordant lens of massive sulphide, containing at least 60% sulphide, which is underlain \nby a discordant stockwork or stringer zone of vein-style mineralisation enclosed within a pipe of hydrothermally altered rock. A \ndeposit may comprise several individual massive sulphide lenses and their associated stockwork zones. Mineralisation tends to \noccur at a single stratigraphic interval within which several individual deposits may be developed. \n \nThe IPB formed in a basin located at the passive margin of an exotic terrane that suffered a northward oblique subduction and later \ncollision with the autochthonous Iberian Terrane during the Variscan times 39. Remnants of this exotic terrane include the South \nPortuguese Zone (SPZ) that hosts minor IPB-equivalent mineralisation in the Variscan Arc of south-west Ireland and south-west \nEngland 27, 24. The succession in the IPB can be divided into three units (Figure 4): \n \n1. The Devonian pre-volcanic phyllite-quartzite (PQ) group of monotonous shales and sandstones, with an increasing proportion \nof sandstones in the upper part of the sequence of Upper Famennian age. \n2. The volcano-sedimentary complex (VSC) comprises a series of felsic and mafic volcanic episodes. Felsic volcanic rocks are \ncommonly pyroclastic and may be subaerial or shallow-marine facies. The mafic rocks are either submarine volcanic or sub-\nvolcanic in origin. \n3. The post-volcanic Lower Carboniferous Culm Group (CG) comprises turbiditic sediments filling a subsiding basin. \n \nThe Central Area shares lithological and stratigraphical similarities with the IPB as illustrated in Figure 4. Both regions comprise a \nseries of alternating fine-grained sediments and volcanic rocks formed in a submarine environment. The Milton Abbot Formation \nand the Tintagel Volcanic Formation contain reworked volcanic rocks interpreted as analogous to the basic lavas and tuffs of the \nIPB. The Meldon Chert Formation and the Crackington Formation are also comparable to lithologies within the IPB. \nIberian Pyrite Belt-type deposits are dominated by Fe and S and most are zinc-lead-copper type, with typical ore grades of 2% Zn, \n1% Pb and 0.5% Cu, though locally Cu grades exceed 1%. Most deposits have relatively low Au contents, typically about 1\u2013\n1.5 ppm, with Ag contents mostly in the range 20\u201360 ppm. Ore-element zoning is not common in the IPB. The sulphide deposits \nare stratigraphically associated with detrital and volcaniclastic horizons overlying the felsic volcanic rocks. They are directly \nrelated to black shale horizons that range from 5 m to more than 200 m thick. It has been suggested that most of the massive \nsulphide was emplaced close to the hydrothermal feeder zone 31. \nExploration criteria for IPB-type deposits, including both the essential general parameters and more specific local features and \ntheir significance, are summarised in Table 2, where their presence in the Central Area in also indicated. \n \nSedex-type model and parameters \nSedimentary exhalative (Sedex) deposits are syngenetic massive sulphide deposits hosted by marine sedimentary rocks and were \nformed by submarine exhalative fluids during basin development. They typically form within restricted marine basinal \nsedimentary sequences in an epicratonic tectonic setting, similar to North Devon. They contain the largest proportion of lead and \nzinc resources of any class of deposit in the world. Sedex deposits provide more than 25% of global zinc and lead production and \nare typically an order of magnitude larger than VMS deposits. \n \nThey are typically stratabound, tabular to lens shaped and are composed of many beds of sulphide and\/or barytes laminae 22. The \nlenses are frequently stacked and more than one horizon may be economic. The orebody may be part of a sedimentary succession \noften hundreds of metres thick, and the lenses may persist horizontally for tens of kilometres. Deposits occur in anoxic basinal \n 7\nsediments capping syn-rift sequences in failed intracontinental rifts or in fault-bounded grabens on rifted continental margins. \nThey commonly have a close spatial and temporal relationship with mafic volcanic rocks that vary from tholeiitic to alkaline in \ncomposition but felsic volcanic rocks are uncommon. The host facies are typical of anoxic, starved-basin environments, including \ncarbonaceous cherts, shales, siltstones and coarser clastic rocks, breccias and carbonates. The depositional environment is \ninterpreted as restricted second- and third-order basins within linear marine, fault-controlled trough and basins. Water depth varies \nfrom deep marine to shallow water restricted shelf conditions. The majority of Sedex deposits occur in Middle Proterozoic and \nDevonian\u2013Lower Carboniferous strata. \n \nThe stratigraphical and tectonic setting of the Devonian sediments on Exmoor may be compared with those of the Harz basin \nwhich hosts the major Sedex copper-lead-zinc-barytes deposit at Rammelsberg. This deposit, now exhausted, was worked for over \n1000 years. The estimated total tonnage extracted was about 30 Mt with an average grade of 14% Zn, 6% Pb, 2% Cu, 140 g\/t Ag, \n1 g\/t Au and 20% barytes 19. The Rammelsberg deposit is hosted by the Middle Devonian (Eifelian) Wissenbach shale (Figure 5) \noccurring along a structural line that marks rapid changes in the thickness of dark shales and is the focus of mafic volcanic rocks \nthat occur in the thicker part of the unit. The lateral equivalent of the ore horizon has been recognised up to 7 km from the \nRammelsberg deposit. \n \nThe Harz basin and North Devon are both underlain by alternating sequence of shales and sandstones of Middle to Late Devonian \nage (Figure 5). These formations were deposited in anoxic marine basins in the Rhenohercynian Zone of the Variscan orogen. The \nore horizon of the Rammelsberg deposit is broadly equivalent to the Combe Martin Slates Formation that hosted much of the lead-\nzinc-silver mineralisation at Combe Martin. \n \nGeochemical anomalies are commonly present around Sedex deposits and may be zoned with lead enrichment closest to the vent \npassing outwards into more zinc-rich facies. Copper and Mn anomalies may also be found around the deposit, while Ba anomalies \nmay also occur in the more distal facies. \nExploration criteria for Sedex deposits, including both the essential general parameters and more specific local features and their \nsignificance are summarised in Table 3, where their presence in North Devon is also indicated. \n \nData and exploration criteria \nThe key exploration criteria for IPB-type (Table 2) and Sedex (Table 3) mineral deposits determined the selection of datasets for \nintegration into the prospectivity analysis. The data classes utilised were geology, stream-sediment geochemistry, geophysics \nincluding both aeromagnetic and gravity data, mineral occurrences and regional structure.   \nGeology \nThe study region covers more than twenty British Geological Survey 1:50 000 geological map sheets. Many of these sheets were \noriginally surveyed between 1870\u20131900 but some sheets have since been revised and all are available digitally and fully attributed.  \nRollin et al. used 1:250 000 scale digital geological linework in their prospectivity analysis in south-west England as the digital \ncapture of the 1:50 000 linework had not been completed 29.  The recent release of this dataset was one of the key driving forces \nbehind this study.   \nIn the Central Area, the Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous sequences have been divided into numerous formations \nseparated by tectonic boundaries. By analogy with the IPB, chert and black shale horizons identified in many of these formations \nare important target lithologies for massive sulphide deposits.  Elsewhere, the geological linework has been generalised in part due \nto the semi-regional resolution of the prospectivity mapping.  \n 8\nThe Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous sequences in north Devon shares many similarities with that of the Harz Massif of \nGermany, host to the Rammelsberg deposit. The ore horizon in the Rammelsberg deposit is the Wissenbach Shale, a dark grey \nshale and sandstone sequence of Eifelian age (Middle Devonian). The Eifelian Hangman Grits in Devon although more \narenaceous than the Harz Eifelian sequences, are overlain by the Ilfracombe Slates, which are primarily grey slates with minor \nsandstone (Figure 4). Recent mapping in the Combe Martin area has led to the Ilfracombe Slates Formation being subdivided into \nthe Wild Pear Slates Member, the Lester Slates and Sandstone Member and the Kentisbury Slates Member (Figure 9). Further to \nthe east over parts of Exmoor and the Brendon Hills, the Ilfracombe Slates Formation is undifferentiated. \nStructure \nSouth-west England has undergone major thrusting and faulting during the Variscan orogeny and consequently there are a large \nnumber of structural lineaments present in both study areas. The identification of basement lineaments, that represent deep faults \nthat may have acted as a conduit for mineralising fluids, is important in the definition of prospective areas.   \nIn a description of the key features and evolution of one of the IPB\u2019s most important deposits at Neves-Corvo in Portugal, Relvas \net al. 26 highlighted the requirement for a fault-controlled, seawater-dominated convection cell system to drive hydrothermal \nactivity and for scavenging deeper, multi-sourced metal-rich fluid contributions. Deep fault systems, like those bounding subsiding \nbasins, assist in stabilising long-lived paths of fluid flow. At the Feitais deposit in Aljustrel, southern Portugal, copper stockworks \nunderlie the thicker sections of the deposit and appear to be spatially associated with growth faults that controlled basin geometry. \nThese faults also influenced the distribution of tuffaceous and cherty (exhalative) units that overlie the sulphides 11. \nThe Central Area is transected by a dominant north-north-west trending fault set and a less prominent but potentially significant \nnorth-north-east fault set recorded by both field mapping and from the interpretation of regional gravity and aeromagnetic data. \nThe latter fault set can be seen as lineaments in images of the gravity and magnetic data for the UK and surrounding countries 6, 7 . \nRollin et al. suggested that these structures might influence the genesis of IPB style mineralisation in the Central Area 29. In North \nDevon, structural mapping and geophysical interpretation of data has not been comprehensively recorded and only limited data is \navailable, in particular for the area around Exmoor.   \nGeophysics \nGravity and aeromagnetic datasets were incorporated into the prospectivity analysis. Regional gravity data collected as part of a \nnational survey by the BGS have a distribution of about one station per km2. Detailed gravity surveys have also been carried out at \nseveral localities across the region as part of the MRP programme 38 and to support the BGS mapping programme 28. Stratiform \nmassive sulphide deposits are commonly associated with a small (typically 1-2 mGal) positive residual anomaly although some of \nthe IPB deposits have associated small high-frequency residual anomalies up to 4 mGal 29. Although the regional gravity survey of \nthe UK is undersampled compared with exploration practice in the IPB, an attempt was made to identify residual anomalies that \nmight be targets for further exploration 30. \nRegional aeromagnetic data collected by the Hunting Group for the BGS in 1957-58 was used to calculate the residual magnetic \nanomalies with the aim of accentuating the higher frequency components of the observed data. This residual magnetic anomaly \nhas been used in the prospectivity analysis of both areas. In addition, the analytic signal magnitude was calculated to give an \nindication of the position of the source of the magnetism regardless of the direction of the total magnetisation vector. These \nanomalies represent magnetic pyrrhotite and may also be indicative of primary stratiform sulphide mineralisation. Many of the \nlarger postulated magnetic sources identified by the analytic signal have not yet been tested by drilling. Only the Wilsey Down \nborehole is sited on or close to a local maximum in the analytic signal field, and drilling here identified substantial thicknesses of \ndisseminated pyrrhotite (Table 1). In the Central Area, the magnitude of the analytical signal of the residual magnetic field has \nbeen used to indicate sources for the magnetised zone north of Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor.  \n 9\nGeochemistry \nIn addition to the MRP survey data, stream-sediment sampling was recently carried out in the catchment of the River Tamar (920 \nkm2) area as part of the national Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) regional geochemical mapping \nprogramme. Nearly 500 sites were sampled and analysed for 45 elements including Zn, Pb, Cu and Mn with maximum values of \n1901 ppm for Zn and 8000 ppm Cu recorded in the region 25. \nThe pathfinder elements Pb, Zn Cu and Mn were selected for delineating areas of potential Sedex style mineralisation in North \nDevon. However, the legacy of past mining activity locally presents a significant problem for the application of stream-sediment \ngeochemistry to exploration in the Central Area. Background values for Cu and Mn in the Lower Carboniferous rocks are much \nhigher than in other groups with the geochemical data indicating multi-modal distributions reflecting the populations from various \nlithologies, mineralisation and contamination. This has been taken into account in the prospectivity analysis by adjustment of the \nthreshold (95% values) values for Cu, Pb and Zn in stream-sediment samples collected over Lower Carboniferous rocks. Mine \nworkings and mineral occurrence data have been incorporated into the prospectivity analysis in two ways. Firstly, many of the \nmanganese mines represent stratiform deposition of oxide ores that may be lateral equivalents of base-metal sulphide deposits. \nAccordingly, in addition to known occurrences of stratiform base-metal mineralisation, the presence of manganese mineralisation \nhas been used as positive evidence to support the potential occurrence of sulphide ores. Secondly, the mines in the area provide \nevidence for the occurrence of various metals in hydrothermal vein systems. These data have been used to filter the drainage \ngeochemical data in an attempt to remove the influence of vein mineralisation. In practice, geochemical anomalies for Cu, Zn and \nPb have been excluded from the prospectivity analysis if the sample site is located within 2 km of a mine working which records \none or more of these elements as either a main or secondary commodity. \nIn addition to Cu, Zn and Pb, Mn was incorporated into the prospectivity analysis with high values occurring over Lower \nCarboniferous rocks in the Teign valley and in the central zone near Launceston and Tavistock 29. Manganese values over Middle \nDevonian rocks are generally low. The main exploration criteria utilised in the prospectivity analysis for IPB deposits in the \nCentral Area are summarised in Table 4. \nProspectivity mapping in the Central Area and North Devon \nThe Weights of Evidence method was applied to the prospectivity analysis for IPB-type deposits in the Central Area. Forty-seven \npolymetallic stratiform mineral occurrences were used to \u2018train\u2019 the various exploration datasets for the area. Fuzzy Logic \nprospectivity analysis was carried out for Sedex deposits in North Devon. The Fuzzy Logic method of analysis was selected as the \nmodelling technique due to the lack of known mineral occurrences in the North Devon area.  \nWeights of Evidence modelling: Central Area \nBedrock lithology, residual aeromagnetic and gravity anomalies, aeromagnetic analytical signal, geophysical lineaments, stream- \nsediment geochemistry and mapped structures, selected as the key exploration criteria, were gridded, processed and reclassified to \ngenerate binary-class evidential maps described below (Table 4). The known mineral occurrences were divided into two subsets: \nthe training and the validation subsets.  \nInspection of inter-element correlations showed that As and Sb should not be used in the analysis, whereas Mn, Pb, Zn, Ba and Cu \nwere sufficiently uncorrelated and thus acceptable for integration using Weights of Evidence. In order to convert the data into a \nbinary evidential theme, each theme is integrated with the training point theme and the spatial relationship between both is \ncalculated to derive a suitable cut-off value. This relationship is termed the \u2018contrast\u2019 and the greater the value, the stronger the \nrelationship between the exploration model data layers and the evidential theme. The contrast value can be positive, indicating a \nspatial correlation with the associated with the mineralisation, or negative, indicating that no relationship exists between the two \n 10\nthemes. The contrast sign is used to reclassify the theme into a binary-class layer of true (positive contrasts) and false (negative \ncontrasts). The contrast values for each class of the evidential maps were computed using the training subset only. Pairwise test of \nconditional independence was carried out on all 11 binary evidential themes using Arc-SDM.    \nThe key predictor factors determined for IPB mineralisation in the Central Area, represented by positive contrast values are shown \nin Table 5. They are black shales and chert horizons, Mn in stream sediments and mapped regional structures.  The strongest \noverall predictor, lithology, returned a range of values reflecting the varying prospectivity of each lithology for IPB type deposits.  \nThe strongest contrast values are from slate and chert formations within the study area, agreeing strongly with the IPB mineral \ndeposit model.   \nThe contrast values of the binary-class evidential maps were combined and threshold values determined to generate a rank \nfavourability map for IPB-type deposits (Figure 8). A comparison of the spatial distribution of the predicted high favourability \nareas and the validation subset showed that most of the validation subset fall in the areas of high favourability. In addition, several \nnew areas with high favourability were mapped. \nFuzzy Logic Modelling: North Devon Area \nBedrock lithology, aeromagnetic analytical signal, magnetic and gravity lineaments, stream sediment geochemical anomalies and \nmapped structures were selected as the key exploration parameters for the prospectivity analysis for Sedex deposits in North \nDevon.  Known mineral occurrences were included as an evidential theme as Fuzzy Logic does not require known occurrences of \nmineralisation to be used as training.  \nIn Fuzzy Logic, multiclass themes such as maps are classified on the basis of their mineral favourability using a fuzzy concept that \nallows favourability to be assigned on a continuous scale from 0.0 (non-membership) to 1.0 (full membership)5. For example, As \nvalues in a geochemical dataset may be divided according to percentile values, such that values above the 75% level in the \ncumulative dataset might be considered anomalous (Fuzzy set membership = 1.0) while values below the 25% level might be \nconsidered not anomalous (Fuzzy set membership = 0.) Values between 25% and 75% would therefore be assigned values on a \nscale from 0.1 to1.0.  \nEach evidential theme in the Sedex exploration model was assigned a fuzzy membership or significance value on the basis of the \nmineral deposit model (Table 6 and 7). The weighting applied is dependent on the relative importance and reliability of one data \nset against another.  Areas with an absence of any favourable features, primarily due to a lack of sufficient data were assigned a no \ndata value (-99), the use of which signifies that the data has no impact on the model. \nA structural proximity analysis (\u201cbuffering\u201d) was performed on linear features (faults, lineaments) and point themes (mineral \noccurrences) enabling a cumulatively decreasing weighting to be applied with distance from the feature. Features in each of the \nthree themes were buffered at 500 m intervals. The fuzzy membership assigned to each buffer within each theme is presented in \nTable 7. Areas of known mineralisation were assigned the greatest fuzzy membership decreasing with distance from the \noccurrence. \nThe North Devon prospectivity map was created by combining each evidential theme using fizzy logic operators in a series of \nsteps, as depicted in the schematic inference model (Figure 6). Fuzzy memberships from each theme were combined using fuzzy \noperators to produce a gradational map of the mineral potential of the terrain.  Five operators have been found to be useful for the \ncombination of exploration datasets 1: fuzzy AND, fuzzy OR, fuzzy algebraic product, fuzzy algebraic sum (FAS) and fuzzy \ngamma operators. The Fuzzy Logic operators used to combine the fuzzy sets were selected on the basis of the relationships of the \ndata layers and on the interdependence of the data. In the first level of the model (Figure 6) the fuzzy OR operator was used to \ncombine the geochemical elements Zn and Mn, and Pb and Cu in stream sediments; the results were then incorporated into the \n 11\nsecond level of the inference model.  The OR operator is used when two map patterns represent the same level of evidence, and \nthe combinations suggest evidence at higher probability 40.  The second level of the model combined the evidential themes using \nFAS to output a map of the potential for Sedex mineralisation in the North Devon area. FAS is the complement to the algebraic \nproduct and its use yields results larger than or equal to the largest contributing fuzzy membership value.  Two pieces of evidence \nthat both favour a hypothesis reinforce one another and the combined evidence is more supportive than either piece of evidence \ntaken individually 5.   \n \nResults \nCentral Area \nThe results of the prospectivity analysis for the Central Area are presented in Figure 8. Key features of the main target areas for \nIPB deposits are summarised in Table 8 and are described below. \n \nA. Along the northern edge of the Bodmin Moor granite. This area contains numerous formations with black shales, many \nthrusts and east-west trending faults, and several known occurrences of stratiform mineralisation. Manganese anomalies \nin drainage samples are widespread, while local high tenor stream-sediment anomalies for Zn are also present. There are \nalso several zones where the magnitude of the analytic signal of the magnetic anomaly exceeds 350 nT\/km.  \nB. To the west of the Dartmoor granite in the Chillaton area (Figure 2). This area also contains numerous formations with \nblack shales, many thrusts and has the highest concentration of known occurrences of stratiform mineralisation in the \nregion, where prospective targets occur in the thrust-and-nappe terrane of the Lower Carboniferous strata associated with \nminor positive gravity anomalies. The residual gravity anomalies either side of the Bovey Tracy basin (and at Tavistock) \ncover a larger region and are more likely due to structure in the basement and to data sampling around the Dartmoor \ngranite than to features in the thrust sequence. \nC. Immediately north of Tavistock, to the west of the Dartmoor granite, is a prospective area that is not related to any \nexisting mineral occurrences (Figure 2). This area is underlain by Lower Carboniferous sediments and minor volcanic \nrocks.  \nD. To the east of Okehampton, near Dunsford (Figure 2), is an area where the prospectivity is based on shallow magnetic \nanomalies data and a significant maximum in the analytic signal of the residual magnetic data. This suggests prospective \nterrain beneath Upper Carboniferous strata on Whiddon Down. This area also has the highest Zn and Pb anomalies in the \narea with 4000 and 2100 ppm respectively. It also includes four manganese occurrences and has chert, shale and volcanic \nformations. \nE. Around Ilsington to the east of the Dartmoor granite (Figure 2). The geology of this area contains a number of chert, slate \nand volcanic formations and there is one known manganese occurrence. The area also has an anomalous analytic signal \nvalue of 525 nT\/km and a Pb geochemical anomaly of 1000 ppm. \nNorth Devon \nIt is more difficult to generate a reliable prospectivity map for the Exmoor area because of the paucity of available data. Particular \nrelevance has therefore been placed on geology and stream-sediment geochemistry. Key features of prospective areas for Sedex \ndeposits in north Devon are shown in Figure 10 are summarised below in Table 9. \n \n 12\nA. Along the boundary between the Ilfracombe Slates Formation and the Morte Slates Formation, parallel to the \nregional strike. This area is prospective due to the presence of shallow-source linear magnetic anomalies together \nwith drainage geochemical anomalies for Zn, Mn and locally Pb. Previous ground investigation of the magnetic \nanomalies and subsequent drilling at Honeymead Farm (Figure 3) has also indicated significant pyrrhotite \nmineralisation interpreted as forming from syngenetic pyrite 14. The historical lead-zinc-silver mining area around \nCombe Martin has, however, not been highlighted as prospective for Sedex deposits. This may be due to the style of \nmineralisation worked there not being of Sedex-type since mineralisation observed at Lester Point near Combe \nMartin (Figure 3), consists of thin and discontinuous galena veins not consistent with a stratiform sulphide deposit. \nThe lack of a gravity anomaly in the Combe Martin area may also be because most of the lead mineralisation has \nbeen worked out. \nB. The anomaly in the Brendon Hills area is related to barytes vein deposits in the area and associated anomalous Ba \nvalues recorded from MRP geochemical sampling 17. Sedex deposits typically contain high Ba values with up to 20 \n% at Rammelsberg, and the lenses may be laterally persistent for tens of kilometres. This may therefore indicate that \nthe area is a distal part of a sequence occurring along strike from Sedex-type massive sulphide mineralisation. \nC. An anomaly in the North Molton area (Figure 3) may represent geochemical anomalies relating to mines that were \nactive until the 19th century and worked a variety of ores including copper minerals, galena, sphalerite, siderite or \nhaematite and sometimes barytes 14.  \nD. The prospective area approximately 8 km south-west of Combe Martin is centred on a regional gravity and magnetic \nanomaly at West Down. This anomaly was verified by BGS ground magnetic surveys that indicated a positive \nanomaly of amplitude up to 250 nT due to a body up to 100 m wide at a few tens of metres depth 14. The gravity \nanomaly has since been confirmed by high-resolution gravity surveying which identified a positive anomaly of about \n1 mGal coincident with the magnetic anomaly 8. The anomaly has not been tested by drilling but may represent \ndisseminated pyrrhotite with remnant and induced magnetisation as identified from the drilling of a similar anomaly \nat Honeymead Farm. \n \nConclusions  \n1. Comparison of the geology and mineral deposits of the Iberian Pyrite Belt in Spain and Portugal with those in south-west \nEngland suggests potential for similar stratiform VMS zinc-copper-lead deposits in the (allochthonous) Devonian-\nCarboniferous volcano-sedimentary sequence (VSC) in the Central Area of Devon and east Cornwall. Stratiform \nmineralisation is known to occur at three stratigraphical horizons and at over 60 sites in the East Cornwall\u2013Devon project \narea. Economic mineralisation may be present in these horizons but available data does not provide clear targets for \ndrilling. \n2. By analogy with the geological setting and mineral deposits of the Harz Massif in Germany, there is potential in the \nExmoor district of North Devon for the occurrence of sedimentary exhalative (Sedex) polymetallic (zinc-copper-lead-\nsilver) mineralisation. Evidence from Combe Martin and from drilling at Honeymead Farm, approximately 25 km along \nstrike, provides support for this hypothesis. \n3. Weights of Evidence and Fuzzy Logic prospectivity analysis have been carried out over the two target areas on the basis \nof exploration models for IPB VMS and Sedex deposit types. This has involved the integration of multivariate geological, \ngeophysical, geochemical and mineral occurrence data and has successfully identified several new targets for stratiform \nbase-metal sulphide mineralisation. The main prospective areas are: (i) in the central region along the northern edges of \n 13\nBodmin Moor and Dartmoor and in the intervening ground underlain by Lower Carboniferous strata; (ii) in the Upper \nDevonian and Lower Carboniferous rocks on Exmoor; (iii) in the Lower Carboniferous strata on the eastern side of \nDartmoor. \n4. Underpinning the evaluation of the area to the north of Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor is the assumption that the high-\nfrequency magnetic anomalies present are primarily related to stratiform sulphide mineralisation within the Fammenian-\nVisean sequence subsequently recrystallised to pyrrhotite at the time of granite intrusion. Modelling of these data suggest \nshallow sources for these magnetic anomalies, and drilling has not tested most of these. The main uncertainty is that low \nconcentrations of pyrrhotite can maintain a high NRM intensity so that large magnetic anomalies may be due to only a \nfew per cent sulphide; however, this can only be determined through drilling. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Director of the British Geological Survey (NERC).
