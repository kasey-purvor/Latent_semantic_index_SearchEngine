As with other forms \nof technical and scientific knowledge, it is made in ongoing, everyday practices and places \n(see discussions in the field of Science Studies, for example Latour, 1987; Rosenberg and \nHarding, 2005): at shareholder meetings, in design studios, in science fiction stories (e.g. \nBloomfield, 2003; Cochrane, 1997: 77-78). The future is always situated, particular to the \nplaces where it is made. So what happens to the future when its sites of production move \nfrom place to place? What is the effect of landscape and environment on future-making? This \npaper explores the generative effect of place on futures for one particular case: the UK \nmobile telecoms industry. It considers situated futures in the sense of both the \nepistemologies and the landscapes of future-making (Haraway, 1991).  \n \nIn 2000, five consortia spent \u00a320 billion on UK radio spectrum licences for the 3rd Generation \nof mobile telephony, or 3G; despite the technology, the network infrastructure and handsets, \nstill being in development. 3G was a story, a highly influential story of the future told in \ndiagrams on PowerPoint charts, in technological standards meetings, and (most crucially) in \neager predictions of revenue. Analysts have suggested that the auction of 3G radio spectrum \nlicenses, which occurred across Europe, led to a global economic slowdown (Cheng et al., \n2003). Others estimate that over a million workers were forced to leave the mobile telecoms \nindustry as a direct effect of the auctions, which may have created over \u00a3370 billion in \ncorporate debt (ibid).1 Stories of the future matter in mobile telecoms.  \n \nTelling stories of the future is always a social, material, and political practice. It always has \neffects; it is always non-innocent (Haraway, 1997). In using the trope of story I am intending \nto evoke its performativity. Stories can rehearse and stabilise particular futures, and in so \ndoing make others absent. For example, the Victorian science fiction story of a global \n4 \nelectronic brain, an intelligent planet, as told by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1851, inspired \nMarshall McLuhan to tell his story of the global electronic village, a story which continues to \nbe reproduced as potent vision of a global telecommunications network (Kaku, 1998: 43-44; \nMcLuhan, 1964). But arguments and critical accounts are also stories, with a particular \nliterary form (Ashmore, 1989), therefore it matters what versions of the future are told in \nsocial science and other literatures. This paper attempts, not only to create a critical account \nof the future, but also to rehearse other futures. \n \nMethods \nIn her important paper on the partial nature of objectivity, Donna Haraway argues that \ntechnoscience knowledges are always situated rather than floating nowhere, and therefore \nalways have a partial rather than universal perspective (Haraway, 1991). Following the \nenlightenment analogy of light as knowledge, Haraway then develops the optical metaphors \nof reflection and interference as differing methods for knowledge-making: the mirrored \nreflection of critique versus a generative interference (Haraway, 1994, 1999). Knowledges are \na material-semiotics, they are stories that make a difference to the world. And they are made \ndifferently with different methods. The point of this refiguring of knowledge \u2018is not to just \nread the webs of knowledge production; the point is to reconfigure what counts as \nknowledge in the interests of reconstituting the generative forces of embodiment\u2019 (Haraway \n1994: 62). \n \nBriefly, reflection occurs when light waves collide with the surface of a solid and are reflected \naway; the light waves are simply displaced, and remain unchanged. Critical debates that \nreflect back and forth between the same dichotomy (nature-culture or subjective-objective, \nfor example) reproduce and retain the same dichotomous configuration. This endless \nmirroring can often participate in the stabilising of existing hegemonies. Resonating with \nthese concerns have been recent calls in the social sciences for methods that move beyond \ndeconstructive critique, towards a generative critique that cares for, and is concerned with, \nits real-world effects (Latour, 2004; Law, 2004). \n5 \n \nIn contrast, interference occurs when light waves meet in a place, when they superpose and \nadd together constructively and destructively. It creates a pattern of light and dark, partial \nand fragmentary points of knowledge; knowledge made in pieces, in moments, in fragments \nof evidence. The pattern of superposition is specific to a place: shift either light wave slightly \nand their relationship changes, the pattern changes. Knowledges made through interference \nare made differently in different places, in the double sense of both topographic place and \nepistemological location. Location and partiality are therefore central to interference; in \ninterference methods, the knowledge created is always partial and explicitly dependent on its \nlocation. For example, in writing ethnography from diverse ethnographic evidence, which \nalways comprises incomplete parts that are not part of any whole (Strathern, 1991). Or in \narchaeological knowledges, which alter as an archaeologist moves through parts of an \nexcavation or monument (Turnbull, 2002); as Tim Ingold says so succinctly \u2018we know as we \ngo, not before we go\u2019 (Ingold, 2000b: 230). Moreover, interference as a metaphor for \nmethod also makes visible and germane both knowledges (light) and the creative work \nnecessary to connect them into a meaningful account (pattern). Interference methods \nacknowledge the always generative work of weaving partial knowledges together; that such \ncreativity is an inseparable part of doing empirical work. In the words of Haraway, \u2018what if \nthe study and crafting of fiction and fact happened explicitly, instead of covertly, in the same \nroom, and in all the rooms?\u2019 (Haraway, 1997: 110).  \n \nThis paper weaves two ethnographic accounts of the future in the UK mobile telecoms \nindustry.2 Both accounts are based on evidence collected during a four month ethnography of \nvarious sites of future-making in the industry. The first account practices a method of \nreflection, and creates a generative critique of the evidence. The second account performs an \ninterference, and shifts the location of the evidence to explore the effect of place on future-\nmaking. This second account is perhaps one answer to Haraway\u2019s question above: it is highly \ninventive as well as rigorous and empirical, due to its explicit rather than covert distinction \n6 \nbetween partial evidence and creative work (for further discussion of this method see Watts, \n2005, 2007). \n \nA Reflection \nI had negotiated permission to attend a closed industry association meeting, a gathering of \ncompany representatives to discuss 3G trends in mobile telecoms.  \n \nIt was a very dim December morning in 2003, and the local bus service abandoned me in a \ncul-de-sac of heavily-roofed corporate boxes, squatting besides a dual carriageway; an \nelectricity pylon buzzing overhead.  \n \nI was within an area known as the M3\/M4 Triangle, a region defined by four lines of \nmovement: the M25 London orbital motorway to the east, the M3 motorway to the south-\nwest, the M4 motorway to the west, and the vertical line of the Heathrow flight-corridor \nabove. The author J. G. Ballard had long regarded this Heathrow suburbia, its walled-in\/off \nemployees and car-enclosed lives, as a landscape where mundane corporate life slipped \neasily into psychosis (Ballard, 1973, 2006). It was here that the futures of the mobile \ntelecoms industry were being made. Here were the walled campuses and UK headquarters of \ncorporations such as Motorola, Sony Ericsson, Nokia, O2, Vodafone, Nortel, and Microsoft.  \n \nThe directions to the meeting took Ballard\u2019s view, and assumed I would arrive by car - the \nlocation was given in motorway and road junctions. Taking the bus and walking was an act of \ninsurrection, a rising up onto my feet. In his work on the inseparability of world-making and \nlandscape, Tim Ingold remarks that \u2018through walking\u2026 landscapes are woven into life, and \nlives are woven into the landscape, in a process that is continuous and never-ending\u2019 (Ingold, \n2004: 333). Movement makes a difference to how landscapes and lives are made; movement \nby car weaves together a very different landscape compared to walking for example (ibid; \nEdensor, 2003).  \n \n7 \nPeople did not walk or hike in the mobile telecoms industry; they did not experience beneath \ntheir boot-soles, as I did, the trimmed grass or the disused pavement that began and led \nnowhere. Their landscape was a cambered strip of tarmacadam. The optical fibres beneath \nmy feet (I noted the telecoms manhole covers as I walked) and the radio signals within the \nair, allowed bits of people, binary-encoded life, to move through this landscape far more \neasily than I. My mobile phone was at full reception strength, the mobile telephony network \nunimpeded by the paved world around me. \n \nThis corporate location floated like a mirage above its heavily-manicured landscape of grass \nlawns and parking spaces (Ingold, 2004). The topography of the Thames river valley had \nbeen flattened into submission, made subservient, bulldozed, offering almost no resistance to \neither the embodied or electronic movement of the industry; rather it enabled the movement \nof high-speed automobile, aeroplane, and wired\/wireless communications. The landscapes \nthat were woven through the futures of the mobile telecoms industry (and the futures that \nwere woven through these landscapes) had a politics that were isotropic, flat and unresisting. \n \nAlong with twenty or so other attendees of the meeting, I was called in to a long room with a \nvast boardroom table around which we sat, as though for dinner. Head down to my \nethnographic notebook, I listened and wrote.  \n \nThe director of the industry association set the tone: \n \nOnce bandwidth increases\u2026 the sky\u2019s the limit\u2026 the only limit is our imagination,3 \n \nhe said. \n \nThe future was being mapped onto a line of increasing bandwidth. More bandwidth implied \nbroader (and broadband) possibilities. 2nd Generation, 2G, systems had generally only \nallowed 9.6 Kbps, whereas 3rd Generation, 3G, systems permitted 384 Kbps, a vast \n8 \ndifference. The numbers mattered. 2G was considered very limited (the speed for \ndownloading information was more than five times slower than a typical dial-up modem over \na landline). 3G was envisioned as limitless, constrained only by the imagination of those \npresent. The future was being technologically determined by how fast information could be \nsent to a mobile device. Time and technology were being made into a linear progression; \nmore bandwidth was the future, less bandwidth was the past.  \n \nThe director handed over to an analyst from one of the large multinational consultancies, \nwho were crucial participants in the reproduction of futures in mobile telecoms. She ran \nthrough a series of PowerPoint charts, which predicted future revenue growth for 3G, \nsubscriber numbers, handset sales, volumes of video messages. Yet, although the y-axis \nmetamorphosed from one radically different unit to another, all the graphs retained the same \nshape: an exponential line, an asymptotic curve reaching ever-upwards over time. No matter \nthe politics, economics, materials or labours involved, the future always had the same shape, \nit was always an exponential curve. The sky was indeed the mathematical limit.  \n \nBy 2006 there will be 2 billion 3G subscribers worldwide,  \n \nshe divined from one particular curve. An act of prophecy that I now note over-estimated by \na factor of four.4 Although more accurate than a prediction in 2004, which over-estimated 3G \nsubscription by a factor of one hundred and sixty.5 In retrospect, the story of 3G was wildly \noptimistic, more fantasy and financial desire than actual fact. The shape of the future, that \nexponential line, did not seem to fit the evidence in practice. \n  \nBut it was at another of the association\u2019s meetings, later that year, where I heard the specific \nvision which this line led towards. \n \nIt was an overcast but sticky midsummer day as the taxi leaped over the ramps towards the \ngolf club house, only minutes from the M25 motorway. The cab pulled up to the door and the \n9 \ntaxi driver announced in passing that the country house fa\u00e7ade was an old Victorian \nsanatorium; and I was flung back into Ballard\u2019s world of the landscapes of suburban \npsychosis. In following the signs to the conference suite, I passed a large printed tapestry of \na knight-in-shining-armour, a set of decorated plate armour, and a billiards room, the d\u00e9cor \nof a suburban fantasy of an English country house. \n \nToday was the annual forecasting event for the membership. Forty men and four women \n(according to my tally) sat on gold-painted chairs at one end of the pseudo-Georgian \nconference room, before a felt-covered table with a whining projector pointed towards a \nsmall portable screen. It was hot and humid. \n \nOne of the forecasters made a series of predictions concerning future technologies of \nimportance to mobile telecoms: \n \nFuel cells [are the] alternative power technology\u2026 Key drivers are Moore\u2019s Law\u2026 \nprocess and power goes up at an exponential rate\u20266  \n \nThere it was, the key driver of exponential growth named: Moore\u2019s Law. This was the oft-\nmisquoted prediction by Intel founder, Gordon Moore, of the exponential doubling of \ncomponents per integrated circuit year on year (Moore, 1965). Since that publication over \nforty years ago, and in the rehearsal of the pervasiveness of silicon technology, Moore\u2019s Law \nhad become synonymous with the exponential growth of almost any system in the high-tech \nindustry. Moore\u2019s Law pulled the future of the mobile telecoms industry into a linearity of \nthought: no rhizomes, no regions, no other topology. This relational shape, as a line, had a \npolitics (Law, 2002). It was predictable and safe; just follow the curve, you can\u2019t miss. As \ntime moved forward on the graph, mobile telecoms technologies and revenue all increased \nexponentially. The predictions by the analysts might be hopelessly optimistic but given \nsufficient time, and without deviation from the curve, they would eventually be right.  \n \n10 \nSo, to make a successful investment on the basis of Moore\u2019s Law required careful pruning \naway of any other possibilities, so that only the line remained; a self-fulfilling prophecy. At \nthis meeting there were no other futures discussed, although concerns over the cost of the \nauctions were raised. 3G was a fait accompli for there were no other shapes, no other \nfutures, imagined. The 3G licenses were a necessity to participate in making that future, with \nits predicted revenue, present. No matter the actual extraordinary financial losses and social \neffects of the relentless move along the line from 2G to 3G, no matter the doubts. It had not \nsurprised me when a 4th Generation, 4G, mobile telecoms future began to be discussed; \nanother step on that insatiable line.7 \n \nBut then the next analyst took to his feet, and I began to write again in my ethnographic \nnotebook. He spoke passionately concerning a limitless future mobile network \u2013 this was \nwhere the line was leading: \n \n[Current network] is not good enough. We really need to download the attachments. \nWe really need that always on, anytime, anyplace, anywhere. [Three-and-a-half \nGeneration network] in 2008 is the next big thing\u2026 Real life high quality TV on our \nmobile\u2026 \n \nThis was the vision of the industry: \u2018anytime, anyplace, anywhere\u2019 mobile \ntelecommunications. Time and place would be made irrelevant; the planet would become a \nsingle network, a global system of wireless intelligence. It was that centuries old and familiar \nvision discussed earlier, a re-wording of Hawthorne\u2019s Victorian imaginary rehearsed and \nreproduced by Marshall McLuhan. In this vision the social and material landscape had been \novercome, colonised or bulldozed, but imagined as though flat; as though the planet were \ndevoid of landscapes that resist mobile telephony infrastructure and transmission: mountains \nand sea, jungle and desert, dispersed populations. Sitting here in this pseudo-Georgian \ncountry house, formerly a Victorian asylum, I could look out of the sash window and see the \nneat lines of cut grass, canal, and electricity cables. In this suburban landscape such a future \n11 \nmade sense, was possible. A future of anytime, anyplace, anywhere mobile telecoms was \nwoven through this landscape of 24-hour motorway services with wi-fi access, and vast \nconcrete airport terminals with extra cellsites to boost mobile phone signal. Here a future \nmobile network that was always on, anywhere, was almost present, so close, so un-\nimaginative. 2G to 3G to 4G. Follow the line. Linear movement, linear future, linear time. This \nsuburban landscape and its predictable future were woven together. I felt haunted by J. G. \nBallard:  \n \nI would sum up my fear about the future in one word: boring. And that's my one \nfear: that everything has happened; nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever \ngoing to happen again... the future is just going to be a vast, conforming suburb of \nthe soul. (Ballard, 1984) \n \nAn Interference \nThe sky was filled with grey clouds of luminous water. Rain hung in the air, a metallic \natmosphere above the surface of the loch. Here, on the archipelago of Orkney, where the \nAtlantic and North Sea met above Scotland, I was closer to the Arctic Circle than to London, \ncloser to Norway than to France.  \n \nI stood, watching, sheltered inside the grass-covered dome of Sand14, a design company \nworking on a future for mobile telecoms. Through the studio window the distant black edges \nof the prehistoric stone circle of the Ring of Brodgar had been filed and softened by the rain. \nFive minutes walk away, just out of sight, were the remnants of another stone circle, three \ntowering shards of flagstone stabbed into the earth. And on the hills all around were more \nprehistoric standing stones, hidden within the mist. Sand14 was located at the heart of a \ncontinuing four thousand year-old architectural project. The temporality of the landscape was \nsuffused with the long dur\u00e9e, with technologies that had endured, and would endure (Ingold, \n2000a).  \n \n12 \nBut this company was not bricks and sods of earth, but a literary experiment. It was an \ninterference into future-making, a superposition of Orkney and ethnographic evidence \ncollected elsewhere. For Orkney was a place where my mobile phone signal seemed so \nerratic as to rise and fall with the wind; where even television struggled through the hills and \nover the water between the islands. This landscape resisted radio signals; \u2018anytime, \nanywhere, anyplace\u2019 was meaningless. Here, perhaps, other futures might be imagined. \n \nIn the low-lit foyer of Sand14 the social researcher, Anne, sat hunched into a round red \nfleece ball, concentrating on video footage from her research. She rotated and gave me a \nbroad smile, her wide-frame bouncing with energy. She pointed to a freeze-frame image of a \nwooden drawer. It was stuffed with flattened photographs, a surface of faces and yellowing \ncolour. \n \n[How do people] access something you hand on from generation to generation\u2026 \nDigging slides up, boxes of prints from the attic. That\u2019s an experience we should \nunderstand. That nostalgic experience,8 \n \nshe said.  \n \nI nodded, scribbling in my notebook. \n \nAnne rotated back to the image. \n \n[We need to] help create living memories\u2026  \n \nshe murmured. \n \n13 \nLater, as the atmosphere transmuted from steel to titanium in the early dusk, we joined \nSimon, the mechanical engineer, for a walk down the isthmus towards the Ring of Brodgar \nstone circle.  \n \nThe wind was a slow, buffeting chill, and the white stars of hemlock in the verge tossed back \nand forth in the wet air. Simon and Anne, in dark suits of waterproof clothing, walked \npurposely ahead, chatting, and I listened as their words were blown back along the road. \n \n\u2018It\u2019s nothing to do with the quality of the image,\u2019 Anne was saying. \u2018Not really. You can keep \nyour megapixels and bandwidth. It\u2019s sharing the stories with everyone else\u2026\u2019 \n \n[So] how to create an experience for your senses? \n \nasked Simon.  \n \nIt\u2019s the qualitative part of what sharing is all about\u2026 It\u2019s the magic of sharing. \n \nWe rose up on the isthmus between the lochs, off the road. The stones on the near horizon \nformed a suture between hilltop and heavy cloud. \n \nAs we crossed the line of stones, we stepped from grass into heather. All around us the \nground slipped away, so that the distant hills and lochs around the isthmus seemed to \nencircle us; an orchestration of earth, sea, stone and sky that created an extraordinary \nexperience of a circular landscape, as though the world spun around this monumental axis \n(Richards, 1996).  \n \nWe walked clockwise around the inside of the circle, up the slope, whilst Anne and Simon \ntalked on. At the fragments of one fallen stone they slowed. The flagstone lay flat and \n14 \nsevered on the ground, and a small green sign read: this stone was struck by lightning on 5th \nJune 1980 and shattered. \n \nSimon crouched down to touch the splashes of lichen, spikes of white hair pointing down \nfrom his woollen hat; he drew his fingers along a gouge between the bedding planes. \n \n\u2018It\u2019s as if the stone\u2019s remembered the lightning,\u2019 he said, looking up. \u2018And we\u2019re here, reading \nthat memory, written in the shattered fragments.\u2019 \n \nAnne stood chin to chest, gold-rimmed glasses cast downwards at the stone. \u2018That\u2019s what we \nneed,\u2019 she mused. \u2018A stone that remembers a moment. A moment in stone that can be \npassed on from generation to generation \u2013 a mobile telecommunications that endures \nthrough people.\u2019 \n \nA few months later, the group had translated those insights into a shape to hold a mobile \ntelecoms future; a three dimensional shape of a future they named the Camerastone. \n \nThe prototype was an oddly sculptured polished-stone ball, with six thick nodules extruded \nfrom opposing sides (facing left, right, front, back, up, and down) \u2013 a shape inspired by \nprehistoric artefacts found nearby. From the base of the stone a tangle of ribbon cables \nthrashed their way uncomfortably towards the back of a PC tower.  \n \nCarefully, I moved the ball and tried pushing the dial at the base. The smooth nodules on the \nother five sides made my fingers slide up and down as I grasped its cool surface.  \n \n\u2018I think you\u2019ll need to rock it,\u2019 suggested one of the illustrators sitting nearby, reminding me \nthat the device was kinetically powered; movement was intrinsic to the workings of the \nCamerastone. She leaned over and held out her hand, twisting it back and forth to show me.  \n \n15 \nI gripped the stone and rocked it back and forth a few times, feeling it come to life. Then I \nbent to peer into one of the nodules, through a lens, and into a bright LCD screen.  \n \nOn the screen, as though through a telescope, there was a vision of a heather-encrusted \ndomed mountain, scree slopes falling out of frame. I looked in to the other screens around \nthe surface of the ball, and saw the same mountain from the other four directions; one side \nfalling towards pasture and sea, an image taken from a ferry or boat. And then I looked in \nthe top of the stone, and there was a photograph of a well-wrapped person standing on the \nstone summit of the mountain before a seascape of gold-green islands falling over a far \nhorizon. It was a seductive experience, as if the mountain had been miniaturised, was some \ntiny other universe caught inside the scrying glass of the Camerastone. It was like looking in \nto another time. \n \nIn a design meeting many weeks earlier I had heard how they had produced, not just this \nprototype, but also a series of plastic models of the Camerastone (replicated on their 3D \nprinter). Anne, the social researcher, had been handing these out all over the islands. Across \nOrkney, jewellers and architects, grandmothers and teenagers, had been inspired by the \nshape and initial concept of the model. But each had transformed the Camerastone into \nsomething slightly different.  \n \nA jewellers had electro-plated and etched their model, creating a show-piece in a display of \nphoto-frames. Their future object held images and videos of a family close together; \neveryone in the family could have their own Camerastone, linked and updated constantly. An \nelderly lady called it a wishing stone, and hoped friends and family could send her pictures of \ntheir lives into which she could peek from time to time (after rubbing the stone like a magic \nlamp to switch it on). An American tourist at the cathedral had said she would buy one if it \ncontained an experience of the building, a little world that she could take with her, leave in \nthe bottom of a drawer, and then rediscover years later. And the local newspaper was awash \n16 \nwith letters suggesting links with social networking internet sites, with ideas for how to create \nfantasy worlds within the stone, with stories of hand-knitted covers. \n \nThere was no single Camerastone as a technological future, but only multiple instances of the \nCamerastone, over which Sand14 did not lay intellectual claim but rather perpetuated, \ninspired, and made possible. It was not one future, but many mutating futures. \n \nHowever, Sand14\u2019s approach foundered in one crucial respect: how to communicate those \nmultiple futures back into the mobile telecoms industry. As Anne had noted, the Camerastone \nwas embedded here on the islands. You could not simply move it somewhere else. The \nCamerastone futures were inseparable from the lives and imaginations of the many people \nand businesses who made them. The industry would therefore have to travel to Orkney to \nunderstand those futures. But she did have a suggestion. \n \n\u2018Invite them to the Ring of Brodgar,\u2019 she proposed. \u2018Show them how the stone circle has to \nbe there, in that place, otherwise the stones and hills no longer create that special experience \nof a circular world. Shift those stones anywhere else and the skyline is all in the wrong place. \nIt\u2019d be nothing more than some misshapen flagstones, not that wonderful orchestration of \nearth, sea, and sky. If you wanted to move the Ring of Brodgar you\u2019d have to completely \nchange the architecture. It\u2019s a local technology, see. The technology of the stones and the \nlandscape are irreducible \u2013 you cannot separate them out.\u2019 \n \nShe gave her wise smile. \u2018It\u2019s the same with the Camerastone. The Camerastone and the \nRing of Brodgar are both enduring, local technologies. They\u2019re both part of the landscape.\u2019 \n \nConclusions \nTwo shapes for the future of mobile telecoms are made present in this paper, in two different \nplaces: the line of Moore\u2019s Law close to London Heathrow, and the mutable Camerastone on \n17 \nthe islands of Orkney, Scotland. Yet, as Tim Ingold might say, those futures are woven into \ntheir landscapes, as the landscapes are woven into those futures.  \n \nThe shape of Moore\u2019s Law is a fixed and unchanging future, an exponential line perhaps forty \nyears old. It is a universal story that is understood to hold anywhere, anytime in the world; \nan immutable mobile, so to speak (Latour, 1987: 223-228). It is also a story intrinsic to a \nlandscape where mobile telecoms networks are themselves experienced as pervasive and \neverywhere.  \n \nThe shape of the Camerastone, by contrast, is a solid object, but one whose story shifts and \nmutates as it moves from person to person, from jeweller to tourist. It is locally specific, \nalways changing as it moves. The Camerastone, it might be said, is a mutable mobile. This \nlocated future is intrinsic to a landscape where telecoms networks are experienced as patchy \nand localised.  \n \nMarianne de Laet and Annemarie Mol have developed a detailed case study of a mutable \nmobile (de Laet and Mol, 2000). In their closely argued study they note several \ncharacteristics of a mutable mobile technology: its boundaries are vague and moving; it is \nvariable over time; and it endures through local adaptation (rather than universal stability). \nAnd in their particular case, it achieves much of this through its status as an open and public \ndomain technology. \n \nThe Camerastone, as a possible future, fulfils all of these criteria. First, as an object it is \ninseparable from the social networks who are inspired by, and imagine its use, in everyday \nlife. Its boundaries as an object do not simply end at the edge of the stone shape but must \ninclude those people who participate in creating it as a future. Sand14 do not provide both \nobject and future, they seed the object, which then gathers futures; it is future-tropic. \nSecondly, the Camerastone is not a fixed future but a series of ongoing and changing futures, \nconstantly re-told and re-made over time. It does not hold still but continually inspires new \n18 \nfutures. And finally, the future that is the Camerastone is part of the lives and landscapes in \nwhich it is imagined. It endures because it is able to alter and adapt to different business \nideas, and different inspirations. This is why the Camerastone is so difficult to transport, since \nit is not a neat, well-bounded future, but is locally entangled, and constantly being re-\ninvented. For these reasons I would argue that the Camerastone is what de Laet and Mol call \na fluid technology \u2013 and it creates a fluid future in contrast with the fixed future of Moore\u2019s \nLaw. \n  \nThe shape of the Camerastone and of Moore\u2019s Law are the effect of two methods, which \ncreate two very different stories of future-making. These stories are not written to obfuscate \nthe future: \u2018telling a story\u2026 is not like unfurling a tapestry to cover up the world, it is rather a \nway of guiding the attention of listeners or readers into it\u2019 (Ingold, 2000a: 190). These stories \nguide attention to the inseparability of landscapes and future-making more generally. They \nsuggest that different places - their temporality, topography, sociality, and sensory \nexperience \u2013 may lead to very different everyday practices, and therefore the creation of very \ndifferent futures. Place interferes with how futures are imagined and made. Rather than \nglobal futures as universally the same, situated futures are located in landscapes and \nepistemologies around the globe, and are not everywhere the same, do not have to be fixed \nor linear, and they do not have to be predictable or boring.\n19 \nEndnotes \n1.
