Lessons learned have \ninformed the development of regional and federal mental health policies.\nConclusion A multifaceted and comprehensive programme can be effective in overcoming organizational barriers to the \nintroduction of evidence-based multisectoral interventions in one Russian region. This can help facilitate significant and sustainable \nchanges in policy and reduce institutionalization.\nBulletin of the World Health Organization 2007;85:858\u2013866.\nUne traduction en fran\u00e7ais de ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9 figure \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019article.

Following the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, this region experienced \nincreased mental illness and high suicide \nrates along with widened socioeconomic \ninequalities, high mortality from alcohol \nand tobacco-related diseases, rapidly ris-\ning HIV incidence and declines in life \nexpectancy.6\u201310\nThe WHO Global Burden of Dis-\nease study \u2013 which used limited data \nfrom the Russian Federation11 \u2013 esti-\nmated unipolar depression to account \nfor 4% of the country\u2019s total burden \nof disease in 2002.12 The suicide rate \npeaked in the mid-1990s, when for \nmen aged 50\u201354 years this was over \nsix times that seen in the United States \nof America: 139 and 22.5 deaths per \n100 000 population, respectively.13 In \n2002, Russian men had the second-\nhighest rates of suicide in WHO Euro-\npean Region, with rates of 69.3 per \n100 000 males and 97.2 per 100 000 \nin the 45\u201354 year old age group.13,14 \nBetween 1990 and 2000, the number \nof individuals registered as disabled \nbecause of mental illness increased by \n17.4% to reach 861 650. This accounts \nfor 20% of all people registered as dis-\nabled in the Russian Federation.15,16\nThe isolation of Russian psychiatry \nduring Soviet times and limited fund-\ning of mental health services severely \ncurtailed access to new evidence.17,18 \nConsequently, most practitioners lack \nthe knowledge and skills required to \ndeliver a range of effective medical and \npsychosocial treatments necessary for \ncommunity-based care.\n859Bulletin of the World Health Organization | November 2007, 85 (11)\nResearch\nMental health reform in the Russian FederationRachel Jenkins et al.\nMoreover, despite the high bur-\nden of mental illness globally, the \nMillennium Development Goals do not \ndirectly include targets for mental disor-\nders; thus these illnesses attract meagre \ninvestment by international donors.19 \nConsequently, donor investment to re-\nform mental health services in eastern \nEurope, when available, has been sparse, \nshort-term and unisectoral.20\nAlthough a Declaration and Action \nPlan endorsed by all WHO European \nMember States prioritized mental health \nin Helsinki in 2005,21,22 the Russian \nFederation and post-communist coun-\ntries have yet to introduce reforms to \nenable innovative treatments to be em-\nbedded in routine care.23,24\nWe summarize the main interven-\ntions employed and outcomes achieved \nby a research project funded by the \nUnited Kingdom (UK) Department for \nInternational Development. This proj-\nect adopted an integrated and multifac-\neted approach to mental health reform \nin the Russian Federation that aimed to \npromote social inclusion of people with \nmental illness.\nMethods\nThe study was implemented be-\ntween 2002 and 2004 in Sverd-\nlovsk oblast (available at: http:\/\/\nwww.iop.kcl .ac.uk\/departments\/\n?locator=430&project=10256) in three \npilot areas: urban, semi-urban and rural. \nIt was directed by a multidisciplinary \ngroup of UK-based and Russian profes-\nsionals led by the Institute of Psychiatry \nin London and the government of the \nSverdlovsk oblast,1 in collaboration \nwith the Russian Federal Government, \nWHO, and local municipalities and \nuniversities.\nWe employed action research,25 us-\ning qualitative and quantitative methods \nof enquiry in three interlinked stages. \nWe paid particular attention through-\nout to participation of local researchers \nand stakeholders, and to reflexivity and \nmethodological relativism to avoid cul-\ntural bias and understand behaviours \nand practices in the Russian context.26,27 \nData emerging from the study were \nregularly discussed at individual meet-\nings and workshops with local collabo-\nrators and key stakeholders to reinforce \nour inductive approach and triangulate \nfindings.\nIn stage one, published data and \ndocuments on mental health issues in \nthe Russian Federation were analysed to \nunderstand the local context. In stage \ntwo, we undertook a rapid situational \nassessment, an approach tailored from \nprevious similar work in mental health \n(for example, see www.mental-neuro-\nlogical-health.net) and communicable \ndiseases,28\u201331 which included site visits, \ndiscussions with key stakeholders and \nkey informant interviews to explore \ncontextual and health system barriers \nto change and care delivery, especially \nthose factors which hindered intersec-\ntoral approaches and the engagement \nof users and nongovernmental organi-\nzations (NGOs) in the planning and \ndelivery of care. These were augmented \nby focus groups, direct observation of \nclinical practice, and further examina-\ntion of documents and routine data.\nThe data emerging from the sec-\nond stage informed the third stage of \nthe study, which lasted two years and \nincluded the design and implementa-\ntion of three major organizational and \noperational interventions aimed at: \ndeveloping new structures to enhance \nintersectoral working, strengthening \ninteragency collaboration, developing \ncommunity-based services as alterna-\ntives to institution-based treatment and \ncare, increasing the availability of social \nrehabilitation, and fostering meaning-\nful involvement of users and NGOs \nin care processes. First, we developed \nfederal- and oblast-level policy dialogues \nand created intersectoral steering com-\nmittees (ISCs) at oblast and municipal \nlevels to coordinate access to health, \nsocial care, housing, employment and \nother support services for clients with \nmental illness. Second, we established \nand trained multidisciplinary spe-\ncialist teams (available at: http:\/\/\nwww.iop.kcl .ac.uk\/departments\/\n? l o c a t o r = 4 3 0 & p ro j e c t = 1 0 2 5 6 ) \nat each pilot site, and trained so-\ncial workers (available at: http:\/\/\nwww.iop.kcl .ac.uk\/departments\/\n?locator=430&project=10256) and \ngeneralist doctors to recognise and \nmanage mental disorders. Training \nprogrammes, which included contem-\nporary training materials and WHO \nmental illness guidelines,32\u201334 were itera-\ntively refined through ongoing analyses, \nparticipant feedback, and emerging \nneeds articulated by local collaborators \nand trainers. Third, through training \nand technical support, we enhanced the \ncapacity of NGOs in advocacy, service \ndelivery and governance (available at: \nhttp:\/\/www.iop.kcl.ac.uk\/departments\/\n?locator=430&project=10256). We used \ninterviews, focus group discussions, \ndirect observations of clinical practice, \nteamwork and intersectoral liaison to \nunderstand how our interventions in-\nfluenced policy and practice.\nWe assessed the effectiveness of \ntraining using validated questionnaires \ncomparing pre- and immediate post-\ncourse assessment of knowledge, fol-\nlowed by interviews and focus group \ndiscussions to ascertain if knowledge \nand skills gained were applied when \nplanning and delivering services.\nWe used routinely collected data \nfrom the regional Health and Social \nProtection ministries to measure service \nutilization by mentally ill clients, the \nnumber of dedicated beds for treating \npatients with mental illness, and admis-\nsion\/readmission rates. There were no \nroutinely collected patient-level data on \noutcomes.\nResults\nThe health system context\nMental health has traditionally been a \nlow priority within the Russian health \nsystem. While landmark legislation in \n1992 guaranteed the rights of indi-\nviduals with mental health problems, \nresources to support the system\u2019s mod-\nernization have been insufficient. In the \nmid-1990s, the federal Urgent Measures \nfor Improving Psychiatric Care pro-\ngramme received only 0.2% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in funding \nand could not be implemented, while \nit has been contended that in some in-\nstitutions in the late 1990s there were \ninsufficient funds to provide adequate \nnutrition for inpatients.35 The need to \nfurther improve mental health services \nwas recognized in the federal Psychiatric \nCare Network Reorganization pro-\ngramme for 2003\u20132008. This initia-\ntive set objectives of improving access \nto services and conditions in mental \nhealth hospitals; expanding outpatient \nservices, day-care facilities and sheltered \nworkshops; and bringing psychiatric \ndispensaries closer to patients\u2019 homes.\nThe federal health ministry devel-\nops legal and regulatory frameworks, \nstrategies and policy guidance for deliv-\nery of all specialist health programmes, \nincluding mental health, which are used \nby oblasts to develop local strategies. \nThey, along with municipal administra-\ntions, are responsible for most mental \nhealth services.\n860 Bulletin of the World Health Organization | November 2007, 85 (11)\nResearch\nMental health reform in the Russian Federation Rachel Jenkins et al.\nCare remains predominantly \ninstitution-based, provided in 2004 \nthrough 279 psychiatric hospitals and \n110 inpatient departments within 171 \npsychiatric dispensaries,36 each serving \na population of approximately 25 000. \nSpecialist psychiatric units serve people \nwho also have tuberculosis. Care can \nbe provided in psychiatric departments \nwithin general hospitals as well. The \nRussian Federation continues to have \none of the highest levels of psychiatric \nbeds per capita in Europe at 113.2 \nper 100 000 population, or more than \n161 000 beds in 2005.37 Ambulatory \ncare is provided through 171 psychiatric \ndispensaries, 2271 psychoneurological \ndoctors\u2019 offices, 12 psychotherapeutic \ncentres and 1117 psychotherapeutic of-\nfices. There are 15 287 places in day-care \nhospitals, but community-based treat-\nment and care facilities are very limited. \nWhile psychiatrists are numerous (13.3 \nper 100 000), there are few social work-\ners (1.2 per 100 000).38\nIndividuals who do not respond \nwell to treatment at dispensaries may be \nadmitted to long-term social care institu-\ntions (internats), where they remain in-\ndefinitely. These internats, managed by \noblast Social Protection ministries, pro-\nvide places for approximately 125 000 \npeople.38\nMental health services are predomi-\nnantly funded through government \nbudget transfers and allocated by oblast \nfinance ministries, largely on the basis \nof historical expenditure and available \ninfrastructure rather than according to \npopulation need or the burden of men-\ntal illness. Psychiatric hospitals absorb a \nhigh proportion of this budget but meet \na relatively small proportion of popula-\ntion need. Funds are \u201clocked\u201d within \nthese long-stay institutions, which have \nperverse incentives to maintain high \nbed-occupancy levels as they are paid \nby bed-days. Regulations prevent re-\nsource transfers or budget-pooling to \ncoordinate provision across sectors, for \nexample to invest in social housing, \nsupported employment or vocational re-\nhabilitation services. These regulations \nprevent interaction between different \nspecialist health-care programmes, gen-\neral health services and social protec-\ntion sectors,39\u201341 and constrain NGOs \nfrom playing roles in planning and care \ndelivery.\nAbsence of contemporary training \nmaterials and evidence-based guide-\nlines hinder effective care. The lack of \nmultidisciplinary teams prevents indi-\nvidualized multi-axial assessment and \ntreatment. Intersectoral collaboration \nbetween health, social protection, \nemployment and housing agencies is \nlimited not by explicit government \nprohibitions, but rather because agency \nstaff members are wary of interdepart-\nmental or intersectoral communication \nthat might be construed as political. \nCivil society resources are few, and fam-\nily care-givers are isolated from wider \nnetworks of support. This encourages \nfamilies to accept their relatives\u2019 place-\nment in internats, particularly as they \nthen bear no financial responsibility for \nlong-term care costs.\nImpact of interventions\nOrganization, regulation and \nservice delivery\nThe situational analysis identified sev-\neral attitudes and beliefs likely to im-\npede change. The first of these is reliance \non a narrow model of mental disorders \nthat focuses primarily on the medi-\ncal treatment of psychiatric symptoms \nand underestimates psychological and \nenvironmental factors\u2019 effect on illness \ncourse and outcome. The second factor \nis therapeutic pessimism concerning the \npossibility of recovery from severe and \nenduring mental illness, and an associ-\nated belief in the necessity for long-term \nprotective institutional care for most \npatients. The third impediment is a hi-\nerarchical approach to clinical decision-\nmaking where the psychiatrist assumes \nresponsibility for directing assessment \nand treatment activities, limiting input \nfrom other disciplines. Finally, there \nis an incorrect belief that proposed \nchanges to the service structure and \nclinical practice would contravene exist-\ning legal or regulatory guidelines, that \ntreating mental health problems in \nprimary care is not allowed, and that \ncommunity social workers are forbid-\nden to care for people with mental \nillness. Analysis of regulatory and legal \ndocuments and subsequent clarification \nwith Russian lawyers revealed no such \nlegal or regulatory barriers. Communi-\ncating these findings to key stakeholders \nwas a critical step in dispelling myths \nabout barriers to reform and in secur-\ning support.\nThe project established intersec-\ntoral collaboration at strategic and \noperational levels. At the strategic level, \nintersectoral collaboration and coordi-\nnation was achieved through the ISCs \n\u2013 now well-established with high-level \npolitical support, chaired by the health \nminister at oblast level and by mayors \nat the municipal level. At the opera-\ntional level, multidisciplinary specialist \nteams that include psychiatrists, social \nworkers, nurses, psychologists and occu-\npational therapists have been established \nat the three pilot sites. They undertake \nmulti-axial assessments, develop care \nplans, initiate treatment and rehabilita-\ntion programmes for clients to ensure \ncommunity-based care with minimal \nhospitalization, regularly review prog-\nress of clients and revise treatment pro-\ngrammes, and intensively work at the \nstart of an illness episode to prevent \nsocial exclusion, job loss and adverse \naffects on families.\nThe ISCs, which meet at least once \nevery three months, analyse problems \nto inform policy. They have established \nhostels and social housing, created shel-\ntered work opportunities and fostered \nclose working links between multidis-\nciplinary specialist teams and medical, \nsocial and educational assessment com-\nmittees.2 They also have assisted in de-\nveloping social services for people with \nmental illness living in the community, \nand encouraged the inclusion of NGOs \nas an integral part of service delivery.\nReturn to employment is a criti-\ncal component of social inclusion. \nThe project worked with federal- and \nregional-level officials to establish return-\nto-work programmes. For example, \nthe Federal Employment Service has \nset up a federation-wide programme \nto encourage people with disabilities \nback to work. Hitherto, in Sverdlovsk \nat least, this programme had largely ig-\nnored people with mental illness, so the \nproject worked with the oblast Ministry \nof Social Protection and the Federal \nEmployment Service in Sverdlovsk to \nestablish an initiative to help people \nwith mental illness return to work. At \nregional level, municipal employment \nofficers are now invited to participate in \nmunicipal and oblast ISCs and to share \njob vacancies with mental health teams, \nand employment centres collaborate \nwith mental health services to provide \nongoing support to clients.\nThe project has strengthened verti-\ncal links between the federal and oblast \nhealth ministries in relation to mental \nhealth. Joint meetings in Sverdlovsk and \nMoscow were held to discuss project \nimplementation, mental health policy \nand broader social, employment and \n861Bulletin of the World Health Organization | November 2007, 85 (11)\nResearch\nMental health reform in the Russian FederationRachel Jenkins et al.\nhousing policy issues affecting mental \nhealth care. These meetings led to a \nfederal mental health policy within \nthe Prevention of and Struggle Against \nSocially Significant Diseases 2007\u20132011 \nframework. Collaboration with the \nMinistry of Social Protection has led to \nthe appointment of municipal social \nworkers to aid people with mental ill-\nness.\nImpact of training and \ndevelopment\nForty-six generalist physicians com-\npleted the training course on mental \nhealth offered by the project, with a \nfurther 204 physicians trained by local \nstaff. By 2012, another 927 physicians \n(223 general practitioners and 704 \npolyclinic-based district physicians) in \nthe oblast will receive this training.\nNinety-three mental health workers \ncompleted the project specialist training \nprogrammes with significant resulting \nknowledge gains (Table 1). While the \nUK-based trainers instructed cohorts 1 \nand 2, cohort 3 was taught by Russian \ntrainers selected from previous cohorts. \nThe Russian-trained cohort achieved \nknowledge gains comparable to those \nachieved by previous cohorts, indicating \nthat they were able to effectively repro-\nduce the training. Key informant inter-\nviews and focus groups demonstrated \nthat the specialist training programme \nhas helped foster enduring changes \nin practice. It did this by creating a \ncritical mass of practitioners capable of \ndelivering multidisciplinary assessment \nand treatment as routine care, and by \ntraining members of the local clinical \nand academic workforce to replicate the \ntraining programme, enabling wider \nknowledge of novel treatment ap-\nproaches.\nThis training programme has been \nincorporated into the curricula of the \noblast medical college and oblast medical \nacademy, which train nurses, psychiatric \nnurses, general doctors, psychiatrists, \nsocial workers and psychologists. The \nprogramme has particularly influenced \nthe advanced training course developed \nby the oblast medical college for re-\ntraining nurses as social workers, which \nis now used throughout the Russian \nFederation. The fifty-three municipal \nsocial workers trained by the project \n(http:\/\/www.iop.kcl.ac.uk\/departments\/\n?locator=430&project=10256) were \nsubsequently integrated with local inter-\nsectoral and multidisciplinary teams.\nTable 1.

Workshops with the federal Min-\nistry of Health and Social Protection \nand three conferences with the Russian \nPsychiatric Association showcasing the \nSverdlovsk project transferred the ex-\nperience in Sverdlovsk to other Russian \noblasts. Human resource development \nundertaken by the project is summa-\nrized in Table 2.\nService utilization, efficiency \nand access\nService delivery approaches are shifting \ntowards community-based care in all pi-\nlot sites, giving patients improved access \nto social rehabilitation programmes and \nindustrial rehabilitation workshops, as \nwell as to hostels for formerly institu-\ntionalized patients. Establishing sup-\nported housing proved particularly dif-\nficult, with only one pilot site creating a \nsmall number of places. Self-help groups \nhave been established in all the pilot \nsites. In pilot sites 2 and 3, the number \nof individuals with psychosis who have \nobtained employment has substantially \nincreased. These two pilot sites now \nroutinely gather client satisfaction data, \nand more clients receive multi-axial care \nplans. (Table 3).\nTable 4 shows admissions and re-\nadmissions levels in the pilot sites and \nSverdlovsk oblast from 2001 through to \n2006, two years after the project ended. \nWhile there has been little change in \nthe number of beds available, admission \nrates between 2001 and 2004 fell in all \npilot sites. These data must be treated \nwith caution, partly because of the avail-\nability of new population census data for \nthe Russian Federation from 2002 and \nchanged municipal catchment areas, \nwhich in pilot site 3 artificially reduced \nthe admission rate. Pilot site 1 merged \nwith another facility during the project, \nmeaning that the full impact of reduc-\ntion in bed use cannot be identified.\nNonetheless, the number of admis-\nsions in pilot site 1 fell from 2323 to \n988, a 57% decrease, while in pilot site \n2 these decreased from 3358 to 3178, \na 5.3% decrease. Moreover, reductions \nin admissions were maintained in two \nsubsequent years. In the entire oblast, \nbetween 2001 and 2004 admissions \nincreased from 26 501 to 27 197 before \ndeclining to 24 636 by 2006. By 2006 \nrates of readmission in all three pilot \nsites were below the readmission rate \nobserved in the oblast as a whole.\nImpact on NGO involvement\nTraining and capacity building of eight \nNGOs enabled their further develop-\nment and integration as care providers. \nSeven of these had established self-help \ngroups, and all had developed employ-\nment programmes or programmes that \noffered people more meaningful activity, \neven if they were not able to earn a real \nincome. NGOs successfully implement-\ned grant funded projects to create eight \nnew employment and housing projects \nacross the oblast.\nBy the project\u2019s end two new NGOs \nwere established. The ISCs also involved \nboth NGO activists and users, acknowl-\nedging their importance and raising \ntheir profile as care providers; this was a \nfundamental shift from the deep-rooted \nsuspicion about NGOs revealed in the \ninitial situation analysis.\n862 Bulletin of the World Health Organization | November 2007, 85 (11)\nResearch\nMental health reform in the Russian Federation Rachel Jenkins et al.\nTable 2.

Despite per-\nceived legal, structural and financing bar-\nriers that prevent flexible use of financial \nand human resources, it is possible in the \nRussian Federation to develop intersec-\ntoral and multidisciplinary approaches \nto manage mental illness.\nWe show that demonstrable im-\nprovements in pilot projects can be used \nto disseminate good practice and to \ninform policy at regional and federal \nlevels. For example, while the regional \ngovernment in Sverdlovsk has indicated \nits commitment to scale up the project \nfrom pilot sites to cover the whole \nregion, the Russian government has ar-\nranged for wider dissemination of proj-\nect outcomes and materials across the \nfederation, including project guidelines \nfor developing mental health policy and \nfor treating mental illness in a primary-\ncare setting.\nThe study has shown that within \nexisting regulations and organizational \nstructures in the Russian Federation it \nis possible to establish ISCs to encour-\nage intersectoral planning, modify care \napproaches to develop alternative com-\nmunity-based service models delivered \nby multidisciplinary teams, improve so-\ncial rehabilitation coverage, and extend \nemployment and housing opportunities \nfor people with mental illness.\nReplicating this progress across all \n89 regional divisions in the Russian \nFederation will be challenging, but the \nHigh Level Working Group for Tubercu-\nlosis Control in the Russian Federation \nconvened by WHO has demonstrated \nthat cross-learning among regions and \nbetween the regional and federal levels \nis possible.42\nThe long-term impact of mental \nhealth training will be influenced by the \nextent to which the trained physicians \nremain in primary care, which needs \nstrenghening.43 Yet the pilot sites\u2019 expe-\nriences show that primary health care \nand community-based approaches are \npossible.44\nIn spite of these achievements, five \nkey barriers need to be addressed if the \nRussian Federation is to shift away from \n863Bulletin of the World Health Organization | November 2007, 85 (11)\nResearch\nMental health reform in the Russian FederationRachel Jenkins et al.\nTable 4.

This provides perverse \nincentives for health-care providers to \nmaintain existing beds and hospitalize \npatients with mental illness. Existing re-\nsource allocation and provider payment \nsystems should be changed to ensure \nefficient providers are not penalized for \ndownsizing capacity.\nSecond, the Russian regulations \nstipulate periods of hospitalization for \npatients with mental illness. These need \nrevising, combined with economic in-\ncentives to discourage undue delays in \ndischarging individuals from inpatient \ncare.45\nThird, downsizing the hospital sec-\ntor and shifting to community-based \ncare require reducing or redeploying \nstaff. This is politically difficult to \nachieve and requires carefully designed \nhuman resource policies.\nFourth, because community-based \nservices for mentally ill patients and so-\ncial support for the unemployed major-\nity of these patients are underdeveloped, \nit is difficult to rapidly implement lower-\ncost and therapeutically more effective \nalternatives to inpatient care. Investment \nis needed to develop these sectors.\nFifth, financing regulations in the \nRussian Federation prevent pooling of \nsectoral budgets and shifting funds from \nhealth sectors to social protection sec-\ntors. Revision is required in regulations \nthat discourage multisectoral policies \nand co-financed community-based in-\nterventions that encourage deinsitution-\nalization and develop community-based \nsupports.\nThe Russian Federation has de-\nclared its commitment to mental health \nreform.21,46 The recent merger of the \nfederal ministries of health, labour and \nsocial protection facilitates coordinated \nplanning, resource pooling and inte-\ngration of health and social protection \nservices to address the complex needs of \npeople with mental illness. In the short \nterm, the constraints identified above \npose a challenge to attaining rapid and \nsubstantial improvements, but with \nstrong leadership these changes are \nfeasible.\nCurrent policies that focus on \npopulation health47 need to embrace \nmental health along with the more \nvisible factors that have contributed \nto the demographic crisis in the Rus-\nsian Federation.10,48 Embedding mental \nhealth in primary health care services \ncreates the opportunity to benefit from \nthe Presidential Priority Health Project, \nwhich is injecting approximately US$ 4 \nbillion per year to the primary health \ncare system over three years.49\nWe tried to address our study\u2019s \nlimitations. We were unable to measure \noutcomes, because our sponsor\u2019s chang-\ning priorities reduced funding in the \nfinal year these studies were planned. \nWe used routinely available data to as-\nsess results instead. We used qualitative \nresearch with theoretical rather than \nrandom sampling of stakeholders.\nOur findings nonetheless have im-\nportant implications for mental health \ncare in the Russian Federation and the \nwider region where similar systems ex-\nist. Introducing community-based care \nand using existing resources more effi-\nciently require reform of health system \nstandards and of regulations related to \nplanning, financing and clinical care. \nSuch changes take time, and reforms \nshould focus on carefully developed \nmedium- to long-term system improve-\nments rather than short-term fixes that \ncannot be sustained.  \u25a0\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\nR\u00e9forme de la sant\u00e9 mentale dans la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de Russie : d\u00e9marche int\u00e9gr\u00e9e favorisant l\u2019int\u00e9gration \nsociale et le r\u00e9tablissement des malades\nObjectif Faciliter la r\u00e9forme de la sant\u00e9 mentale dans une r\u00e9gion \n(oblast) russe par une approche syst\u00e9matique de la conception et \nde la mise en \u0153uvre des politiques dans ce domaine.\nM\u00e9thodes Les auteurs ont entrepris un programme de \nrecherche pragmatique sur trois ans, couvrant trois sites pilotes et \ncomprenant une s\u00e9rie d\u2019interventions selon plusieurs axes : \n\u00e9valuation de la situation pour fournir une base \u00e0 la planification, \nmaintien d\u2019un dialogue politique aux niveaux f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et r\u00e9gional \npour catalyser le changement, introduction d\u2019une collaboration \nmultidisciplinaire et intersectorielle \u00e0 tous les niveaux, organisation \nde formations pour am\u00e9liorer les comp\u00e9tences des professionnels \net aide aux organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) dans la \nmise au point de nouveaux mod\u00e8les de soins.\nR\u00e9sultats Les programmes de formation d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s dans le \ncadre de ce processus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9gr\u00e9s aux programmes de \nformation classiques, avec comme cons\u00e9quence une am\u00e9lioration \nmesurable des comp\u00e9tences du personnel.
