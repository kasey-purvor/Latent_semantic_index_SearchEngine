In a graptolite fauna from Slieve Gallion, the \npresence of Isograptus victoriae lunatus, the index fossil of the victoriae lunatus \ngraptolite zone, indicates a correlation with the Australasian Castlemainian (Ca1) \nStage.  The U-Pb zircon age of 473 \u00b1 0.8 Ma dates a volcanic arc-related rhyolite \nbody that sits stratigraphically below graptolitic mudstones of Slieve Gallion.  The U-\nPb isotopic and biostratigraphical age constraints match closely with an interpolated \nage for the base of the Middle Ordovician (Sadler & Cooper 2004), and indicate a \nWhitlandian age for the upper Tyrone Volcanic Group, which supports the regional \ncorrelation with the Ballantrae Complex, Midland Valley Terrane, Scotland. \n \n \nThe Tyrone Igneous Complex extends over an area of approximately 350km\n2\n of \nCounties Tyrone and Londonderry in Northern Ireland.  It is recognised as part of the \nbasement of the Midland Valley Terrane of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland \n(Fig. 1a) (Bluck et al. 1992). A strong regional link has been made between the \nTyrone Igneous Complex and the Ballantrae Complex of Girvan (Bluck 1985), which \ntogether compose the Tyrone-Girvan sub-terrane.  In a broader context, the Tyrone \nIgneous Complex appears to fit most closely with the Notre Dame Subzone of the \nDunnage Zone of Newfoundland, as described in Van Staal  et al.  (1998). \n 2\n  Although the distinctive array of igneous and sedimentary lithologies present in the \nTyrone Igneous Complex was recognised by the Geological Survey of Ireland in the \n19\nth\n Century, it was Hartley (1933) who first appreciated the lithological and \nstratigraphical similarities between it and the Arenig Ballantrae Igneous Group in the \nGirvan area of southwest Scotland.  This correlation was apparently dispelled when \nHartley (1936) reported very rare graptolites from \u201cblack shales\u201d in the upper part of \nthe Tyrone Igneous Complex on Slieve Gallion, which appeared to indicate a \nLlandeilo-early Caradoc age.  Remapping of the Pomeroy area by the Geological \nSurvey of Northern Ireland (1979), led to the recognition of the two groups of rocks \nthat now constitute the Tyrone Igneous Complex, namely the structurally lower \nTyrone Plutonic Group overlain by the Tyrone Volcanic Group (Fig. 1b).  The \nresurvey also identified the varied lithologies and temporal array of the major \nintrusive bodies that are present.  However, no new evidence for the age of the Tyrone \nIgneous Complex was forthcoming and indeed the possibility of a Dalradian age for \nthe basal Plutonic Group was suggested (Geological Survey of Northern Ireland \n1979). \n  The geological significance of the Tyrone Igneous Complex again changed with the \nseminal work of Hutton et al. (1985), who recognised the ophiolitic affinity of the \nTyrone Plutonic Group, and demonstrated a basic igneous association of layered, \nisotropic and pegmatitic gabbros, doleritic sheeted dykes and rare basaltic pillow \nlavas.  In the overlying Tyrone Volcanic Group they identified the components of a \nvolcanic arc sequence, comprising pillow lavas, tuffs of basic to intermediate \ncomposition, rhyolites, chert, siltstone and dark grey mudstone representing up to \nthree volcanic cycles.  Further graptolite specimens discovered by Hutton & Holland \n(1992) at the locality on Slieve Gallion pointed to a much older age for the Tyrone \nVolcanic Group within the Ordovician than proposed by Hartley (1936), but were still \nsomewhat indefinite, being long-ranging forms of Arenig-Llanvirn age. \n  Though individually fault-bound, the Tyrone Plutonic Group and Tyrone Volcanic \nGroup are considered to be contemporaneous (Hutton & Holland 1992; Parnell et al. \n2000), and are pinned together by a suite of volcanic arc-related intrusions of Arenig \nto Llanvirn age (Noble et al. pers. comm.).  A tonalite intrusion belonging to this \nsuite, located at Craigballyharky northeast of Pomeroy (Fig. 1b), with a published U-\nPb zircon age of 471\n+2\n\/\n- 4\n (Hutton et al. 1985), intrudes and mixes with gabbro (Angus \n1962, 1977) thought to belong to the Tyrone Plutonic Group ophiolite. Such magma \n 3\nmixing demonstrates that the gabbro was still molten at the time of tonalite intrusion, \nand hence an Arenig age for part of the Tyrone Plutonic Group is conceivable. \nThis paper provides a more refined biostratigraphical age for mudstones within the \nTyrone Volcanic Group, and presents a high precision U-Pb isotopic age for an \nunderlying volcanic arc-related rhyolite body. \n \nBiostratigraphy \n \nPrevious biostratigraphy \nBiostratigraphical evidence for the Ordovician age of the Tyrone Volcanic Group of \nthe Tyrone Igneous Complex has been based solely on small collections of \nfragmentary graptolites from one locality in the Sruhanleanantawey stream at IGR \n27905 38790 (Fig. 1b). The stream section, on the northwest slopes of Slieve Gallion \n[from IGR 2788 3886 to IGR 27901 38785], exposes a variety of lithologies including \ngreenish grey tuffs and lava with hornblende and feldspar phenocrysts, chert, light \ngrey, thin bedded tuffaceous siltstone and dark grey, thin to medium bedded mudstone \nwith variable amounts of tuffaceous debris and pyrite. \n  The graptolite specimens discovered by Hartley (1936) were identified as \nDicranograptus (most probably Dicranograptus rectus), and Climacograptus which \nindicated an upper Llandeilo to lower Caradoc age and a correlation with volcanic \nrocks at the base of the succession in North Co. Down in the Southern Uplands-\nDown-Longford Terrane (Fig.1a; Anderson et al. 2004).  Further graptolite specimens \ncollected by Hutton in the 1980\u2019s were identified (Hutton & Holland 1992) as \nTetragraptus serra (Brongniart) and Sigmagraptus s.l.  The age defined by these \ngraptolites is somewhat indefinite since the former is recorded throughout the Arenig \nand possibly the early Llanvirn (VandenBerg & Cooper 1992), whilst the \nSigmagraptus, though likely of Arenig age, are too fragmentary to be identified with \ncertainty.  However, the evidence provided by Hutton and Holland clearly \ndemonstrated that the Tyrone Volcanic Group was much older than previously \nenvisaged by Hartley and was broadly attributable to the Arenig-Llanvirn. \n \nNew biostratigraphy  \nIn order to improve biostratigraphical control for the Tyrone Volcanic Group, a search \nfor additional fossil evidence was undertaken.  Although no new fossiliferous \n 4\nlocalities were found, the historical locality on Slieve Gallion was recollected and \nmore than twenty graptolites and a brachiopod were recovered that now form the basis \nof this study.  Most of the new graptolite specimens collected are fragmentary and \nslightly deformed (the eccentricity of the strain-ellipse in the plane of bedding is \nestimated to be about 1.2:1), but it has been possible to identify the forms listed \nbelow: \n \nLarge dichograptid stipe fragments (=Dichograptus?), Text-fig. 2b \nBranched dichograptid fragment [indet.], Text-fig. 2c \nDidymograptellus nitidus (J. Hall), Text-figs 2d-f, g?, k? \nIsograptus victoriae lunatus Harris, Text-figs 2h, i, j \nLingulate brachiopod [umbo lies just forward of the posterior margin] \n \n  In addition, the specimens collected by Hutton & Holland (1992) were re-examined.  \nThe thin stipes formerly identified as Sigmagraptus are presumably referable to the \nSigmagraptidae, but could not be identified more closely.  Further preparation of the \nspecimen identified by Hutton and Holland as Tetragraptus serra revealed five stipes \nand it is now considered to be a pentad example of Dichograptus octobrachiatus \n(Text-fig. 2a). \n  Based on the identification of graptolites in the new collection, the fossiliferous \nmudstones of Slieve Gallion can be assigned to the Isograptus victoriae lunatus Zone \nof the Australasian graptolite succession (VandenBerg & Cooper 1992) and to the \nlowest Ca1 subdivision of the Castlemainian Stage (Table 1); the base of this division \nlies very close to the triangulatus conodont zone, which is now taken internationally \nto represent the base of the Middle Ordovician (Cooper 1999).  In terms of the British \nsuccession this horizon is approximately equivalent to a level at the top of the \nWhitlandian Stage of the Arenig. \n  The Castlemainian (Ca1) graptolites from Slieve Gallion are younger than other \nfaunas so far recorded in the Ballantrae Complex (Ingham 2000), with the exception \nof the latest Castlemainian (Ca4) assemblage from the North Ballaird Borehole (Stone \n& Rushton 2003; Maletz, Stone & Rushton 2004).  The latter fauna is rich in \nisograptid graptolites and is typical of deep-water assemblages in the low latitude \n\u2018Pacific Province\u2019 (Cooper et al.  1991).  The fauna from Slieve Gallion is much less \nrich, but the presence of isograptids and sigmagraptine fragments reflects the Pacific \n 5\nProvince rather than the \u2018Atlantic Province\u2019, though only weakly because isograptids \ndo occasionally reach deep-water sites in the Atlantic Province (e.g. in the Skiddaw \nGroup of the English Lake District and in North Wales), whilst Didymograptellus \nnitidus and Dichograptus octobrachiatus are regarded as pandemic and not restricted \nto a particular province (Cooper et al. 1991). \n \n \nAssessment of the graptolite fauna \n     Stratigraphically the most significant find is Isograptus victoriae lunatus Harris \n(Figs. 2h?, i?, j).  A juvenile proximal end from a cherty layer is flattened but is \nrelatively undeformed (Fig. 2j).  A fragmentary stipe on the same block that shows \nproximal curvature (Figs. 2h, i) is referred to the same species, but with some reserve.  \nThe sicula is 2.9 mm long, of which the supradorsal part is 0.6 mm wide and 1.4 mm \nlong; sicular aperture 0.55 mm wide; ventral notch wide, 0.6 mm deep; nema \npreserved for nearly 1 mm.  Stipe width at th2 is 1.4 to 1.5 mm, and this width is \nmaintained on the longer stipe fragment which has a 2-theca repeat distance of 1.4 \nmm (equivalent to about 7 thecae in 5 mm).  There are 2 pairs of pendent thecae.  \nThese specimens therefore agree with I. victoriae lunatus (Cooper 1973, p. 59, text-\nfig. 8), and most of the dimensions lie close to the mean for the subspecies (Cooper \n1973, table, p. 112). The small number of pendent thecae is not matched by other I. \nvictoriae subspecies. \n  In Australasia I. victoriae lunatus is confined to Ca1 of the Castlemainian, \n(VandenBerg & Cooper 1992, p. 62), and it is used as a zonal fossil for the correlative \nlevel in western Newfoundland (Williams & Stevens 1988).  This lies within the \nmuch longer reported ranges of the other species now recorded from the Slieve \nGallion site.  The top of the victoriae lunatus graptolite zone, the lowest of four zones \nof the Castlemainian (VandenBerg & Cooper 1992, p. 42), is correlated \napproximately with the top of the Whitlandian Stage of the British succession, and the \nbase of the zone is used to recognise the base of the Middle Ordovician in graptolite-\nbearing successions. \n   Dichograptus octobrachiatus (J. Hall), Figs 2a, b?  Preparation of the specimen in \nthe collections of Trinity College, Dublin, no. TCD.28759a-d (counterparts) shows \nthat it has five stipes and it is now identified as a pentad form of Dichograptus \noctobrachiatus.  This species most commonly has eight stipes, but Elles & Wood \n 6\n(1902, p. 78, pl.10b, d, e) recorded specimens with 7, 6 or 5 stipes.  The specimen in \nFig 2a agrees best with D. octobrachiatus, examples of which were described by \nWilliams & Stevens (1988); their text-fig. 14B shows a specimen with comparably \nclose initial branching.  Other robust species such as D. octonarius (Hall, 1865, pl. 10, \nfigs 1, 2) and D. solidus Harris & Thomas (Cooper & Fortey 1982, fig. 13) have the \nthecae more widely spaced.  The stratigraphical range of  D. octobrachiatus is long: \nVandenBerg & Cooper (1992, p. 59) record its range in Australasia from the base of \nthe Bendigonian to the middle of the Darriwilian (basal Arenig to mid-Llanvirn). \n   Didymograptellus nitidus (J. Hall), Figs 2d-f, g?, k?.   Maletz (1994) transferred this \nspecies from the genus Expansograptus or subgenus Didymograptus \n(Expansograptus), where it was formerly placed, to his revised concept of \nDidymograptellus Cooper & Fortey (1982, p. 220).  In the new collection are two \nslender horizontal specimens of Didymograptellus (Figs 2d, 2e) that can be referred to \nD. nitidus, and a more doubtful robust specimen (Fig. 2k) that is poorly preserved \nproximally.   The stratigraphical ranges recorded for D. nitidus in different regions are \nnot consistent, possibly reflecting uncertainties surrounding the identification of some \nof the recorded material.  According to Williams & Stevens (1988, text-fig. 3) D. \nnitidus ranges through the Bendigonian and Chewtonian, not reaching the lunatus \nZone at the base of the Castlemainian.  VandenBerg & Cooper (1992, p.60) give its \nrange through the Chewtonian and into the lower half of the Castlemainian.  In \ncontrast, the British material referred to nitidus by Elles & Wood (1901) occurs in \nstrata of equivalent age to the mid- to late Castlemainian (Ca2-3) and early Yapeenian \n(Ya1).  D. nitidus appears, therefore, to indicate only an undifferentiated Arenig age. \n \nU-Pb Dating \nSample location and selection \nThe sample of very fine grained, flow-banded rhyolite analysed (MRC 290) was taken \nfrom a northeast-southwest orientated, elongate (15 km by 0.5 km), sheet-like body \nthat stretches from the Fernagh Townland, 8 km southeast of Sixmilecross, through \nCashel Rock to near Formil Hill 3 km east of Greencastle (Fig. 1b). This rhyolite body \nand other similar bodies are enclosed within a sequence composed predominately of \nbasic to intermediate pillow lavas and tuffs.  However, exposure in the study area is \nlimited so there is uncertainty as to whether or not they are intrusive, extrusive or \nboth.   At Cashel Rock (Fig. 1b), rhyolite has a clearly intrusive contact with tonalite, \n 7\nwhereas at Beaghbeg, another rhyolite body demonstrates brecciation and mixing at \nits margin with the background tuffs. Given these relationships and textural \ncharacteristics, the interpretation is that the rhyolite bodies were high-level and syn-\ndepositional so that both intrusive and extrusive contacts would be expected. \n  In terms of composition, and despite its grain size, the rhyolite was an obvious target \nfor zircon U-Pb isotopic dating.   The body also sits structurally and stratigraphically \nlower than graphitic pelite and black chert bearing localities at Mountfield quarry and \nBroughderg that are thought to represent the top of the third volcanic cycle, and \nequate with the Slieve Gallion site where biostratigraphical constraint has been \nestablished.  The sample site was located at Formil Hill [IGR 2617 3819] in a well- \nexposed area close to the middle of the body. \n \nAnalytical Techniques \nZircon fractions were analysed by Isotope Dilution Thermal Ionization Mass \nSpectrometry (ID-TIMS) at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory (NIGL). \nAnalytical procedures are described in Noble et al. (1993). Zircon crystals were \nseparated from <355\u00b5m whole rock fraction using standard vibrating-table, specific \ngravity and magnetic techniques.  Crystal fractions for analysis were picked by hand \nunder a binocular microscope. A bulk zircon fraction was annealed at 800\no\nC in quartz \nglass beakers for 48 hours. The zircon crystals were ultrasonically washed in 4N \nHNO\n3\n, rinsed in ultra-pure water, then further washed in warm 4N HNO\n3\n prior to \nrinsing with distilled water to remove surface contamination. The annealed, cleaned \nbulk zircon fraction was then chemically abraded in 200\u00b5l 29N HF and 20\u00b5l 8N \nHNO\n3\n at 120\no\nC for 12 hours following a modified chemical abrasion technique to \nremove portions of grains which have suffered Pb-loss (Mattinson 2005). Chemically \nabraded zircons were washed several times in ultra-pure water, in warm 3N HCl for \nseveral hours on a hot-plate, rinsed again in ultra-pure water and 8N HNO\n3\n and split \ninto single grain fractions ready for dissolution. A mixed \n205\nPb \u2013 \n235\nU tracer was used \nto spike all fractions. Dissolved, spike-equilibrated samples were not subjected to ion-\nexchange procedures but were converted to chloride and loaded onto degassed \nrhenium filaments in silica gel following a procedure modified after Mundil et al. \n(2004). Isotope data were collected using a Thermo Electron Triton equipped with a \nnew generation of MassCom Secondary Electron Multiplier (Noble et al. 2006). A \nminimum of 100 ratios were collected for Pb and 60 for U. Pb ratios were scrutinised \n 8\nfor any evidence of organic interferences which were determined to be negligible. \nErrors were calculated using numerical error propagation (Ludwig 1998). Isotope \nratios were plotted using Isoplot version 3 (Ludwig 1999), and error ellipses reflect 2\u03c3 \nuncertainty. Total procedural blanks were 0.2pg for Pb and 0.05pg for U. Samples \nwere blank corrected for 0.2 pg of Pb, any residual common Pb was corrected using a \nStacey-Kramers common lead composition (Stacey & Kramers 1975). \n \nResults \nFour single grain zircon fractions were analysed (Table 2). Total amounts of \nradiogenic Pb were in the 50 to 200 pg range. Of the four fractions analysed, one lies \nwith the ellipse centroid below concordia but overlapping with the Concordia curve at \n2 Sigma limits. Evidently, the effects of Pb loss were not totally removed by \nchemically abrasion at 120\no\nC.  Higher temperature chemical abrasion may have \ncompensated for this, but it would also result in less Pb being available for the final \nanalysis. Given the relatively small single grain fractions prepared for analysis, it was \ndecided to use a lower temperature for the chemical abrasion procedure. The \nremaining three single zircon fractions gave concordant analyses which overlap \nwithin error to give a concordia age of 473 \u00b1 0.8 Ma. \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThe presence of Isograptus victoriae lunatus in the graptolite fauna from the Tyrone \nVolcanic Group provides the biostratigraphical evidence for correlation with the basal \ndivision of the Australasian Castlemainian (Ca1) Stage of the Arenig.  \n  Sadler & Cooper (2004, p. 49) tabulated several control points for the correlation of \nreliable isotopic ages with Ordovician stratigraphical constraints; they provided a \nregression line (Sadler & Cooper 2004, fig. 3.1) from which model ages of the \ndivisions of the Ordovician may be inferred.  Although their regression line is well \nconstrained in the Llanvirn and Caradoc series, age-dating of the earlier Ordovician is \nbased largely on two good data points.  One is an age of 469 \n+5\n\/\n-3 \n Ma (Tucker & \nMcKerrow 1995) for the Undulograptus austrodentatus Zone in the lower \nDarriwilian, equivalent to an horizon in the late Arenig; the other is a basal Tremadoc \nage of 489 \u00b1 0.6 Ma (Landing et al. 2000).  \n 9\n  On Sadler & Cooper\u2019s regression line the age of the base of the Middle Ordovician, \nthough not supported by data-points, is interpolated at approximately 472 Ma.  The \nrhyolite body in the Tyrone Volcanic Group, which underlies tectonised mudstones \nthat are correlated with the early Castlemainian graptolitic strata, gave an isotopic age \nof 473.0\u00b10.8 Ma.  Our results therefore afford a data-point for placing the base of the \nMiddle Ordovician a little later than 473 Ma, very close to what is suggested by \nSadler & Cooper\u2019s line.  In terms of the British Ordovician, this points towards a \nWhitlandian age for much of the Tyrone Volcanic Group.  In Girvan, the age control \nfrom graptolites of the Balcreuchan Group of the Ballantrae Complex (Stone & \nRushton 1983) shows it to have been deposited mainly during the Bendigonian and \nChewtonian stages (see Table 1), correlated by Ingham (2000) approximately with the \nMoridunian and Whitlandian Stages of the basal to middle Arenig.  When other \nsimilarities are taken into account, including the presence of lavas, agglomerates, \ntuffs, and cherts, the correlation between the Balcreuchan Group and Tyrone Volcanic \nGroup is strong. \n  Also worthy of note is that the ophiolitic rocks of the Ballantrae Complex are \npredominantly from deeper within the ophiolite sequence than those seen in the \nTyrone Plutonic Group.  It is possible therefore, that we are seeing parts of the same \nophiolite that have been obducted at different structural levels.  The recent \nreassessment of the age and proposal of an obducted ophiolite model  for Highland \nBorder Complex of Scotland (Tanner & Sutherland 2007), which shares a similar \nposition as the Tyrone Igneous Complex at the northern margin of the Midland Valley \nTerrane, supports such a hypothesis. \n \n \nConclusions \nThe refined biostratigraphical age presented herein correlates the top of the Tyrone \nVolcanic Group at Slieve Gallion with the lower Castlemainian Stage (Ca1) of the \nArenig. \n  The model age inferred by Sadler & Cooper (2004) for the Ca1 horizon at the base \nof the Middle Ordovician, concurs with a high precision U-Pb zircon age of 473 \u00b1 0.8 \nMa that has been produced for a volcanic arc-related rhyolite from the Ordovician \nTyrone Volcanic Group of the Tyrone Igneous Complex. \n 10\n When compared with the regression line of Sadler & Cooper, the 473 \u00b1 0.8 Ma \nzircon age for the Tyrone Volcanic Group rhyolite body sits just below the base of the \nMiddle Ordovician within the Chewtonian Stage.  This is consistent with the \ncorrelation of the overlying graptolitic mudstones of Slieve Gallion to the \nAustralasian Castlemainian (Ca1). \n  The isotopic and biostratigraphical age constraint now available point towards a \nChewtonian-early Castlemainian (= Whitlandian) age for much of the Tyrone \nVolcanic Group, and supports the regional correlation with the Ballantrae Complex of \nGirvan. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nJohn Cobbing is thanked for sharing his regional knowledge of the Tyrone Igneous \nComplex.
