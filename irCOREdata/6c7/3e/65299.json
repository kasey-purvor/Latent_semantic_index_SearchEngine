The major idea behind this paper is to \ndemonstrate and critically assess the possibility of emerging economies re-shaping the \nfuture financial system. Shanghai and Dubai will be used to understand the meaning \nof a government-supported international financial center project. This paper will first \nassess the challenge of the current financial turmoil in relation to financial \nglobalization. Second, Shanghai and Dubai will be used to illustrate their effort\u2014both \nbefore and after the financial crisis\u2014in the establishment of an international financial \ncentre with a view of the challenge toward the current financial system. Finally, I will \nendeavor to draw some parallels\/differences of the responses or measures taken by the \ncountries that were affected by the financial crisis in Asia in 1997 to examine the \npossibility and shortcomings of government-backed financial policy in connection \nwith the global financial architecture. \n \nKey words: Dubai International Financial Center, Financial intermediaries, Global \nFinancial Centers Index, Regulation, Shanghai International Financial Center \nIntroduction \nGlobal market confidence shattered as a result of a chain of huge financial collapses. \nTwo of the U.S. housing mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (sharing 50 \npercent of the U.S. housing mortgage market share) had been nationalized by the U.S. \ngovernment in early September 2008. Then, Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest \ninvestment bank in the U.S., was forced to go bankrupt in the middle of September \n2008. Immediately after that, the largest insurance company, American International \nGroup (AIG) was bailed out by the Federal Reserve with U.S.$85 billion. According \nto the Editorial comment from the Wall Street Journal, after Morgan Stanley and \n 2 \nGoldman Sachs returned to commercial banking, it spelt the end of the Wall Street: \n\u2015And so, in a single week, the era of the independent investment bank has ended. \nWall Street as we\u2018ve known it has ceased to exist.\u2016 (The Wall Street Journal 2008: \n15). According to the estimation of the National Institute of Economic and Social \nResearch (NIESR), the total cost of the sub-prime housing crisis will be in the range \nof U.S.$400 to U.S.$600 billion (NIER 2008: 9). The global growth was expected to \nreduced from 5.0 percent in 2006 to 4.2 percent in 2008 (ibid.: 10). In the final quarter \nof 2008, the global trade in goods and services actually declined by 6.7 percent! The \nNIESR yet expected that by the end of 2010, global growth should return to 2.1 \npercent. (NIER 2009: 10-11) \n \nIn respond to the global financial crisis, it appeared that all the leading economies \ntried to come up with some solution to rescue the global market. All the Group of \nSeven (G7) financial ministers agreed on October 10, 2008 in Washington that the \nconfidence of the financial market in the world should be restored immediately and \none of the broadly agreed measures was to take the ownership of banks by injecting \nmoney directly from the government. According to Willem Buiter, Professor of \nEuropean Political Economy, London School of Economics, guarantee, especially \ngovernment guarantee of banking liabilities is essentially (Buiter 2008) Such a \ndramatic agreement resulted from the tumbling of almost all financial centers of the \nworld did not seem to be able to boost market confidence because the original \nU.S.$700 billion bail-out plan was not especially effective. Dow Jones dropped by 20 \npercent within a week from October 6-10, 2008 and the Tokyo Nikkei Index dropped \n24 percent concomitantly.  \n \nAnother major global cooperation was made through the London Summit on April 2, \n2009 (or G20 Summit).\n2\n The Summit agreed to throw another U.S.$1,100 billion to \nboost the global economy, to help ailing economies through further help from the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), to provide more supervision of multinational \ninstitutions and strengthen regulations, to increase trade, to eradicate tax haven and to \nreform the IMF. (Grice and Morris 2009: 2-3) During the Summit, Barack Obama, the \nPresident of the United States, declared, \u2015After weeks of preparation, we have agreed \non a series of unprecedented steps to restore growth and prevent a crisis like this from \nhappen again.\u2016 (Financial Times, April 3, 2009, p. 4). The Summit set a standard of \n 3 \nagreement and also generated some solidarity among leading economies. They also \nagreed to rejoin in Pittsburgh in September 24-25, 2009 for another G20 Summit. \nNevertheless, some economic sectors of individual countries were still suffered as a \nresult of the crisis. One other noticeable examples was that the largest carmaker in the \nU.S., General Motors, filed for Chapter 11 protection and was officially bankrupt on \nJune 1, 2009,  resulting in a total losses of U.S.$81 billion. (Clark 2009) \n \nThe current financial crisis has demonstrated the problem of the existing international \nfinancial architecture. According to Roger C. Altman, \u2015The financial and economic \ncrash of 2008, the worst in over 75 years, is a major geopolitical setback for the \nUnited States and Europe.\u2016 (2009: 2) Yet, it also signals to a number of emerging \neconomies that there is window of opportunity for them to help create a new order of \nglobal financial architecture. Among the others, the \u2015international financial outreach\u2016 \nof Shanghai and Dubai presents some opportunities and challenges. For one thing, \nthey are determined to greatly enhance their international financial power. As a result \nof this, at the moment of global bail out, the world may need to take into \nconsideration how to engage, if not accommodate, two emerging economies which \nhave long been reliant on the development of state driven financial centers. This paper \nwill first illustrate the interaction between financial liberalization and globalization, \nand followed by using the Global Financial Centres Index 3 (GFCI3) report in 2008 \nto assess the international financial standard between Shanghai and Dubai against \nother financial centers. In addition, I shall discuss the current development of \nShanghai and Dubai with a view to looking at the respective government\u2018s policies of \ncreating their own model of international financial centre before and after the \nfinancial crisis. We will evaluate the responses of the leading economies under the \ncurrent financial crisis with a view to compare the responses that were carried out a \ndecade ago among other Asian economies.  \nFinancial Globalization and the Emerging Financial Centers  \nGlobalization emerged in the period between the latter half of the 19th century and the \ninitial years of the 20th century (1850\u20141914) (O\u2018Rourke and Williamson 1999: 5). \nThe notion of globalization is not new but the outcomes of globalization, such as \nstandardization, marketization and norms adherence, nevertheless, penetrate and \n 4 \nprecipitate into every country, requiring mutual inter-dependence and assimilation to \ntake place. Karl Polanyi\u2018s (1944) ground-breaking book The Great Transformation \nset forth a classical literature in studying the power of transformation, the pattern of \nchange and the facilitation of market economy in the 19th century. The \u2015self-\nregulating\u2016 nature of market behavior actually energized the world toward an \nastonished new page (ibid.: 3). In addition, as argued by Edward J. Nell: \n \nNot that market outcomes are optimal, [italic in original] but rather that they \nhave a certain objectivity and reflect robust good sense. If you pay attention to \nthe market signals, you ought to do all right; if you don\u2018t you will run a serious \nrisk of going under. (1996: 51) \n \nThe momentum of market and the dynamic force of liberalism energize the world to \ngrow in an unprecedented manner. Empirical studies and research recently attribute \nthe transformation of the global economy to the market impetus and the force behind \nit (Chandler 1990). \n \nAs far as international finance is concerned, the U.S. was first confronted with a \nsetback in the 1970s when Nixon announced the collapse of the Bretton Woods \nSystem in 1971 (Gilpin 1987: 134). However, the inability to maintain the Bretton \nWoods System in the early 1970s (U.S. dollars pegged with gold) gave rise to the \nfoundation of our current volatile financial infrastructure. (Komiya et al. 1988: 318). \nAlthough the U.S. financial leadership has been challenged after the 2007-09 financial \ncrisis, the relative decline of the U.S., especially in global finance, is more \ncomplicated. As Beeson and Broome put it clearly, \u201cAs a result, the negative \nexternalities that are potentially generated by U.S. hegemonic influence are likely to \ncome more sharply into focus, especially if scholars examine the complex nature of \nAmerican power in the contemporary era without pigeon-holing such debates into \nideological clich\u00e9s or limited discussions about relative U.S. hegemonic decline.\u201d \n(2009: 5) \n \nDifferent from military might, in the reign of international finance, no state can \nsingle-handedly create a financial hegemony. Benjamin Cohen wrote a decade ago \nwarning that: \u2015Currency spaces now are shaped not by political sovereignty but by the \n 5 \ninvisible hand of competition\u2013governments interacting together with societal actors in \nthe social spaces created by money\u2018s transactional networks\u2016 (Cohen 1998: 5). After \nalmost a decade, in Territory, Authority, Rights: From Medieval to Global \nAssemblages, Saskia Sassen further contended the tension between globalization and \nnation-state by reminding us that \u2015For today\u2018s globalizing dynamics to have the \ntransformative capacities they evince entails far deeper imbrications with the \nnational \u2013 whether governments, firms, legal systems, or citizens \u2013 than prevailing \nanalyses allow us to recognize\u2016 (2007: 1). Financial globalization was made more \nsalient through the latest technology and the facilitation of various intermediaries, \nmutual funds and hedge funds, apart from the subsidiary of various banking sectors. \nAccording to John Eatwell, \u2015Liberalization has been accompanied by extraordinarily \nrapid technical progress \u2013 in data processing and financial modelling \u2013 that has \ntransformed financial markets\u2016 (2008: 83). In time, such dynamism of the \nglobalization of finance eventually brought about two divergent views on the \ngovernance of global finance. \n \nAcademicians such as Robert Shiller (2000) used Irrational Exuberance to describe \nthe rocketing of stock prices in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. He attributed the \ncauses to the financial chaos from the confluence of a cluster of reasons such as the \navailability of internet, irresponsible financial analysts, the increase of pension fund \nand the mutual fund, coupled with the baby boom in the United States. Yet, George \nSoros, the founder of the Quantum Fund, disagreed with the academics by challenging \nthe foundation of the economic theory.\n3\n He argued that:  \n \nIn my view there is no such thing as equilibrium in financial markets because \nmarket participants are trying to discount a future which is itself shaped by \nmarket expectations. \u2026 they are shooting at a moving target rather than \ncounting a future equilibrium. \n(Soros 1997: 2) \n \nHis assumptions are that economic agents are not perfect and knowledge is costly. \nTherefore changes are inevitable. He further contended: \n \n 6 \nI cannot change them [rules that govern financial market] unilaterally. If I \nimpose the rules on myself but not on others, it would effect my own \nperformance in the market but it would have no effect on what happens in the \nmarkets because no single participant is supposed to be able to influence the \noutcome. \n(Soros 1998: xxv) \n \nHe simply called the financial market a \u2017reflexive\u2018 event. His latest comment on the \ncurrent financial crisis is that:  \n \n\u2015The international financial system also needs repairing but there are grounds \nfor optimism. Europe has realized that it needs to complement the euro with a \ngovernment safety net for interbank credit. And the International Monetary \nFund is finding a new mission in protecting countries at the periphery from the \nstorm at the centre.\u2016 (Soros 2008)  \n \nIf we go back to his motto, changing is everything and no one can dominate in the \nfinancial market. We are now actually watching a game of redistribution of financial \npower between the state and the market witnessing the current financial market. Of \ncourse, Soros has been criticized by many that his so-called theory was not new but \nsome sort of personal reflections and most of them are within the scope of neo-\nliberalist doctrine. We will turn to the analysis of two emerging financial centers: \nShanghai and Dubai. \nImportance of Shanghai and Dubai as International Financial Centers \nIn March 2008, Y\/Zen Group, commissioned by the City of London, came up with the \nGlobal Financial Centres Index 3 (GFCI3) report.\n4\n The report used five key areas for \nthe construction of the index. They are: people, business environment, market access, \ninfrastructure and general competitiveness. As a result, London ranked number 1 \n(rating of 795) and New York ranked number 2 (rating of 786). Both therefore are \nconsidered as not just international financial centers but global financial centers \n(GFCI3 2008: 16). The rest of the financial centers were categorized to fulfill various \nroles for international, niche, national and regional purposes. Hong Kong, ranked \nnumber 3, had a rating of only 695, far away from even New York. In other words, in \n 7 \nthe reign of financial and global monetary competition, no one can rival these two \nfinancial hegemonies. Yet, if we move down from the ladder, the competition among \nthe rest of financial centers is as severe as that between London and New York.  \n \nMost important of all, according to the report, three financial centers will become \n\u2015significantly more important over the next two to three years\u2016. They are Dubai \n(ranked 24 and rating of 585), Shanghai (ranked 31 and rating of 554) and Singapore \n(ranking of 4 and rating of 675) (ibid.: 6). If we do not take Singapore into \nconsideration (which should link with Hong Kong more closely), it is intriguing to \nstudy Dubai and Shanghai because their rating had increased by 10 and 27 points \nrespectively from the last GFCI2 in 2007. As far as the report is concerned, \u2015A \nmovement of between 10 and 30 points signifies that the competitiveness of a \nfinancial centre needs to be watched\u2016 (ibid.: 13). Dubai\u2018s financial status, according \nto the report, is less sensitive to change. The GFCI3 indicated that it has been \nevolving toward a mature and stable market in the coming two to three years. On the \ncontrary, Shanghai, although changed rapidly in terms of rating (increasing by 27 \npoints), it might be more volatile and susceptible to global changes. Yet, the report \nagreed that these two financial centers are very dynamic in terms of stability. \n \nDevelopment of Shanghai as International Financial Center \n \nShanghai\u2019s Financial Status before the 2008-09 Financial Crisis \nBefore the establishment of the People\u2018s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, Shanghai \nhad already been a banking and financial center. Under the semi-colonial status, \nShanghai in the 1930s was considered as very liberal and a land of opportunity in \nChina. Yet, after 1949, the PRC banned any activities that were considered as \ncapitalist. Among the other cities, Shanghai was hit hard because of its capitalist and \nfinancial status. After China re-opened its doors in 1978, the idea of locating \nShanghai as financial center was first initiated by the paramount leader Deng \nXiaoping when he visited Shanghai on January 28, 1991. The following year, he also \npaid visit to Shenzhen (the Southern tour) to re-confirm China\u2018s initiative in opening \nits market and sustaining economic reform. He mentioned that  \n 8 \nFinance is very important. It is the centre of modern economy. If finance can be \nhandled well, it will activate the whole economy. In the past [in the 1930s] \nShanghai was a financial centre, a place for free exchange of currency, and it \nhas to be the same in the future. If China has to achieve international financial \nstatus, we need Shanghai. Although it is something in the future, we should \nbegin now. \n(Deng 1993: 366)  \n \nThe 14\nth\n National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party formally named \nShanghai an \u2017international economic, financial and trade centre\u2018 in 1992. Pudong was \ndesignated to be a new economic zone and Lu Jia Zui the Central Business District \n(CBD). Yet, even before 1992, shares were traded in Shanghai in 1984, and the \nPeople\u2018s Bank of China established an \u2017over-the-counter\u2018 market in Shanghai and the \nShanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) was officially opened on December 19, 1990 \n(Gamble: 2003: 167\u2013168) \n \nEver since the mid-1990s, both the central and municipal governments have been \nworking together to attract domestic and foreign companies to invest in Shanghai. In \norder to make it a success, Shanghai\u2018s financial center, considering as a strategic \ninitiative, was directly placed under the central government\u2018s control. The Financial \nWork Party Committee (FWPC) was established in March 2000 under Shanghai \nMunicipal Party Committee and the Financial Services Offices (FSO) was under \nShanghai Municipal Government. Both bodies are directly under the State Council in \ncharge by Chinese Vice Premier (Heilmann 2005: 651).  Even Hong Kong, which has \nalways been an international financial center, was hugely mocked by Zhu Rongji\u2018s, \nChinese Premier, comment that (Freudian slip or subconscious feeling!) Shanghai was \nlike New York and Hong Kong was like Toronto. In other words, Shanghai was \nbestowed such extraordinary power both from the central government as well as from \nthe party. Recently, Wen Jiabao, China Premier, pointed out that financial \ndevelopment is the key to Chinese economic competitiveness (Nie et al. 2008: 115). \n \nIn 2005, Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences completed a report \u2015Assessment of \nthe Financial Ecological Environment on Chinese Cities\u2016 which assessed 50 big cities \nin China by using different financial variables. Shanghai ranked as the top financial \n 9 \ncity.\n5\n Local companies began to set up new headquarters in Shanghai as a result of the \ngovernment\u2018s incentive. According to Sebastian Heilmann, in time, \u2015Shanghai\u2018s \nemergence as the main center of financial business in China was seen as a threat to the \ngrowth of local financial industries in other parts of China\u2016 (Heilmann 2005: 649). \nShanghai\u2018s GDP recorded U.S.$128.8 billion in 2006, and per capita GDP was \nU.S.$7,000 in the same year. (China Daily, February 10, 2007) In 2007 the value of \nthe stock market in Shanghai was U.S.$326,272 million (GFCI3 2008: 43). Until \nDecember 2006, there were 94 foreign banks having branches in Shanghai, with \napproximately U.S.$60 billion capital values (Hugang jinji 2008: 33). Domestically, \nuntil February 2007, 25 out of the 55 Chinese mutual funds established offices in \nShanghai, and four out of nine insurance companies operated offices in Shanghai \n(ibid.: 35). On March 14, 2006, during the Fourth Plenary Session of China\u2018s Tenth \nNational People\u2018s Congress, \u2017Shanghai International Financial Centre 2010 Blueprint \n(2010 guihua)\u2018 was formally included in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) \n(Fan 2006: 708). \n \nAs far as Shanghai\u2018s future development is concerned, according to Liu Gang of \nGuangdong Business School, there are three stages of development. Immediately, \nShanghai should keep its financial status in China by increasing the percentage of \nfinancial contribution in the GDP. Such measures can be worked out initially with the \nlocal financial intermediaries. In the medium term, regulation and financial \ninfrastructure should meet international standards. Government should provide more \nprofessional training and to gradually open up the renminbi or yuan (Chinese currency) \nmarket. In the long run, Shanghai should be considered as a regional financial center, \ncompeting with Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. By that time, the financial market \nshould be completely opened and government\u2018s (especially local government) \nintervention should be kept to minimum (Liu 2007: 153). Yet, internationalization, \nlimited financial products, regulations and limited financial professionals are the \nmajor elements that Shanghai has to improve to narrow the gap from other \ninternational financial centers (Duan 2005: 18). With the construction of the Shanghai \nWorld Financial Center (new tenants began to move in from June 2008), Shanghai\u2018s \ninternational financial center\u2018s status is going to climb to new heights, especially in \nthe provision of state-of-the-art infrastructure and financial hardware.   \n \n 10 \n \nChallenge of Shanghai as International Financial Centre after the 2008-09 \nFinancial Crisis \n \nTo many surprise, the first move of China after the financial meltdown in Wall Street \nin late 2008 was not to respond to the international financial environment but to \nstabilize internal financial stability. One of the major measures was to announce a 14-\npoint of support to Hong Kong\u2018s economy, including the crucial point of letting \ncompanies to conduct cross border trading of Chinese currency (yuan). (South China \nMorning Post, December 20, 2008, Business B1). According to Donald Tsang, Hong \nKong\u2018s Chief Executive, \u2017The motherland, China, will always be the strongest \nsupport.\u2018 (Chan: 1). Of course, the launching of 14-point of support to Hong Kong \nwas also a compensation to Hong Kong as a result of the losing of visitors\/travelers \nfrom Taiwan because of the re-linkage between China and Taiwan.  \n  \nSecondly, China quickly slipped into the chaos and tried to first discredit the U.S. \ndollars in the London Summit. China pledged potential help to the international \nfinancial market by offering U.S.$95 billion yuan to the International Monetary Fund. \nYet, China also wanted to use Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to partly supersede the \nreceding of the power of the U.S. dollars in the international finance. (Evans-Pritchard\n \n2009) Yet, finally, more importantly, the biggest financial initiative after the financial \ncrisis was Shanghai\u2018s financial status. On April 14, 2009, Chinese State Department \nreleased Document 19 which was to officially developed Shanghai as an international \nfinancial center and international transshipment center. In general, according to the \narchitecture of the State Department, Shanghai should be developed as an \ninternational financial center trading in Chinese currency and to accomplish Chinese \neconomic growth by 2020.\n6\n  \n \nWhat about the challenges to other cities in China? In a recent visit to Shanghai \nbetween May 10 to 16, 2009, I attended the Shanghai Forum 2009. Beijing was not \nparticularly happy about Shanghai as the international financial center, according to a \nsenior colleague at Fudan University. He explained that Chinese banking industry \nplayed a key role in Chinese financial development and the big four state-owned \nbanks (Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank and \n 11 \nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China) have the headquarters in Beijing. \nTraditionally, banking was considered to be the linchpin of finance and the central \ngovernment has overarching control from the policy incentive in Beijing. The new \nstatus of Shanghai as an international financial center empowered Shanghai\u2018s ability \nto diversify its financial products to stocks, futures, derivatives and other new \nproducts, which reinforced Shanghai\u2018s regional power, reducing further the ways of \ncontrol from the central government.\n7\n  \n \nMore importantly, the central government\u2018s \u2015special attention\u2016 to be paid to Shanghai \ninevitably develops a sense of \u2017moral hazard\u2018 resulting in further possible corruption \ncases and maladministration. Not to mention corruption, government\u2018s \u2015special care\u2016 \nmay generate inefficiency and lower Shanghai\u2018s competitiveness. As Annalee \nSaxenian has demonstrated in the comparative study of the high tech centers in the \nEast coast (the route 128) and the Silicon Valley in the U.S., the special attention from \nthe government (more government contracts and projects were given to route 128) \nmay actually retard the ability to innovate and to face the market competition \n(Saxenian 1996). According to Liu Mingkang, Chairman of China Banking \nRegulatory Commission (CBRC), \u2015Shanghai\u2018s financial sector only has about \n100,000 professionals, compared with some 400,000 on Wall Street and more than \n250,000 in London.\u2016 (Xinhua 2008) Obviously, such numbers of financial \nprofessionals will not be able to boost Shanghai\u2018s financial status to rival as \nestablished international financial center. \n \nIn addition, it affects the role of Hong Kong which has always been relying almost \nentirely on housing and financial activities to support its economic structure. Before \nthe financial crisis, said Frank Gong, chief economist for China at J P Morgan Chase \nin Hong Kong, \u2015it (Shanghai) can\u2018t compete with even its regional rival, Hong Kong, \nas long as rulers in Beijing refuse to make the currency fully convertible and restrict \nforeign investment in China\u2018s U.S.$400 billion domestic stock market.\u2016 (Mellor 2005) \nAfter the crisis and the granting of the official status of Shanghai, the general \nresponse from Hong Kong was that the central government was biased toward \nShanghai and more and more future policy initiatives will be shifted to Shanghai as a \nresult. (Hong Kong Economic Journal, May 18, 2009, p. 2). Nevertheless, given the \neconomic rise of China, international investment in Shanghai will be manifested by \n 12 \nthe future potential of Chinese market. It appears that one of the lessons from the \ncurrent crisis is that Shanghai is being transformed to not just to serve the fund-raising \nrequirement for the Chinese government, but also given real incentives and to \ngradually compete with the rest of the global financial centers.    \n \nDubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) \nDIFC before the 2008-09 Financial Crisis \nOn December 1, 1971, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qairain, Ras al \nKhaimah and Fujairah, those former sheikhdoms, came together to formulate a new \npolitical entity called the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Pacione 2005: 256). Although \nAbu Dhabi was considered as the administrative center, Dubai is in effect the \neconomic center of the UAE. The ruling body, a Supreme Council, is composed of the \nleader from each of the seven emirates, with the head of state represented by Abu \nDhabi and the prime minister from the ruler of Dubai, as a general rule (Bhatti et al. \n2006: 1)  The idea that Dubai has, for decades, been considered to be the \u2017city of \nmerchants\u2018 stemmed from its strategic location near the mouth of the Gulf as well as \nits geographical position as the hub for boats coming back and forth from Persia, \nIndia, China and East Africa (Al-Sayegh 1998: 87\u201388). At the turn of the twentieth \ncentury, Dubai occupied one of the world\u2018s largest pearl shipping industries (ibid.: 89). \nIn other words, the natural port facilities, the pearl industry and the commercial know-\nhow perpetuated Dubai\u2018s merchant status in the Gulf for decades.  \n \nOil in Dubai, however, was found only in the early 1960s, and, from the very \nbeginning, the government had realized that it was not sustainable in relying on oil \nalone, of which production actually peaked at about 420,000 barrels per day in 1991 \n(Pacione 2005: 257 and Davidson 2008: 101). To keep the economy growing and to \nperpetuate Dubai\u2018s economic development, its leader began to initiate various \neconomic development projects in order to diversify its economy. One of the major \neconomic projects was to develop Dubai\u2018s infrastructure in order to enhance its future \ncompetitiveness: \nIn the mid-1980s, \u2026 Dubai\u2018s crown prince, Sheikh Maktum bin Rashid Al-\nMaktum, together with his two eldest brothers, Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al-\n 13 \nMaktum and Sheikh Muhammad bin Rashid Al-Maktum, met to discuss the \nemirate\u2018s future direction. At a time when other governments in the Gulf were \nreacting to the war by increasing their overseas investments in the West, the Al-\nMaktum family decided the best solution was to buck the trend by making a \ncommitment to invest in their own domestic infrastructure so that Dubai would \nbe able to support and enhance its existing re-export oriented commercial sector \nwhile also facilitating broader diversification away from oil in the future. \n(Davidson 2008: 106) \n \nAirports, hotels, apartments and huge housing projects dominated the headlines of the \nnewspapers in the late 1990s and early 2000s and physically dominated Dubai\u2018s \nskyline. Burj al Arab hotel, Palm Jumeirah and the World (and more recently the \nUniverse) projects are not just infrastructures; they are textbook cases which \nfrequently occupied the Discovery Channel! According to a researcher at the Gulf \nResearch Centre, the government of Dubai is very successful in marketizing the \nimage of Dubai or repackaging Dubai as the city of future.\n8\n  My understanding is that \nit is easier said than done. But, Dubai seems to be able to make use of its huge \nresources base to make a case to be successful. More recently, the Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 1996\u20132010 is to allow Dubai to enjoy the status of \u2017developed \neconomy\u2018 as soon as possible (Pacione 2005: 257). It appears that Dubai\u2018s success is \ncontradictory to the general development pattern of the Middle East as a whole, which, \naccording Robert Looney, has systematically lagged behind the world economic \ngrowth. \u2015For the last thirty years\u2016 he contended, \u2015most of the region has essentially \n\u2017de-globalized\u2018 at a time when its population was doubling\u2016 (Looney 2005: 175). As \none of the key economic development projects, Dubai International Financial Centre \n(DIFC), (contrasting from Shanghai incremental development) deserves much \nattention because of its scale, structural differences, government incentive and \nregional importance. \n   \nDIFC was established in September 2004 to challenge some world established \nfinancial centers (London and New York) to provide securities, equities, fixed income \nand Shariah-compliant (Islamic) securities. One of the characteristics is that it has its \nown legal and regulatory system which has been built upon Common Law system \n(Chance 2008: 51). According to the IMF assessment report of the DIFC in May 2007, \n 14 \nDIFC was a \u2015geographic and legal jurisdiction within the emirate of Dubai\u2016 (IMF \n2007: 4). The constitution of the UAE was amended in 2004 to allow a \u2017financial free \nzone\u2018 to be established. The Federal Law No. 8 clearly pointed out that the financial \nservices and banking facilities of the zone cannot be carried out in local currency. In \naddition, Federal Decree No. 35 also pledged 110 acre of land for DIFC (ibid.). Other \nthan criminal law, all the activities of DIFC will be governed under the UK common \nlaw system, including insolvency law, trust law, personal property law, and \nemployment law. Regulation and monitoring of DIFC is under Dubai Financial \nServices Authority (DFSA), which is also responsible for the registration of \nprofessional services provided within DIFC, such as accountants and lawyers, etc. \n(ibid.: 5). In addition, within the DIFC, the Dubai International Financial Centre \nAuthority (DIFCA) is responsible for economic planning and development as well as \ncompany registration, administration, company law and data protection (ibid.). \n \nDIFC focuses on six primary services: banking, capital markets, asset management, \nIslamic finance, reinsurance and back office operation (Bhatti et al. 2006: 5). Such \nbroad range of services is buttressed with the openness and the transparency of DIFC. \nAmong all the international financial centers listed in the GFCI3, one of the key \nissues is the time zone advantage. This is why London, New York and Hong Kong are \nso important because they spanning eight hours from one another, meaning that they \ntrade for 24 hours a day. Dubai enjoys the same advantage, spanning equal amount of \nhours between Asia and Europe. After the Dubai International Financial Exchange \n(DIFX) was officially operational in September 2005, global big financial firms \nflocked in. Lloyds TSB established in December 2005, Deutsche Bank opened its \nbranch in March 2006 and Morgan Stanley began operation almost at the same time. \nTrading volumes increased tremendously from U.S.$7.9 billion in 2000 to \nU.S.$100.69 billion in 2006 (Saidi 2008: 23). To diversify financial products, DIFX \nwill begin to list equities derivatives from November 2008 to enhance liquidity and to \nattract more investors (Gulf News (Business) October 23, 2008, p. 1). DIFX also \nconsiders a \u2015\u2017fast track\u2018 process for U.S. companies to have a secondary listing in \nDubai\u2016 (ibid). With the help of the latest technology such as Securities Settlement \nSystem (SSS) and the rapid growth of the stock exchange, Dubai has enormously \nsecured its role to provide a safe and stable financial status market in the Gulf region \n(ibid.: 25). Other than financial services, various business schools began establishing \n 15 \nnew offices in DIFC to achieve first move advantage. For instance, Cass Business \nSchool of City University London opened a new office in late 2008 in DIFC to offer \nExecutive MBA programme. \n \nNevertheless, Dubai\u2018s financial status has been increasingly challenged by the \nmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). For example, Qatar allowed \nforeign players to conduct local business. Saudi Arabia\u2018s geographical location and its \nmarket size give rise to its future potential to challenge Dubai (Bhatti et al. 2006: 19). \nAs a whole, the GCC may need to further develop and diversify its financial sector \nbecause they have pegged their currencies with U.S. dollars and the government is \njust having too much revenue. Both factors are not necessarily beneficial to develop \nforeign exchange rate based financial products or even government bond market. Yet, \nthe financial sector of the GCC should be able to support beyond GCC countries. \nAlthough Dubai is already enjoying significant advantages (such as brand name, life \nstyle, political stability, financial infrastructure, regulation and level of globalization), \nit should not procrastinate. Obviously, the revenue and government asset in Dubai, \nhowever, serve as counterweight to off-set some factors which may lead to better \nconfidence building. Other than financial product development, the key question of a \nfinancial center perhaps is the ability to withstand the global financial challenges. \n \nDubai enjoyed lots of advantages. Other than those mentioned before, Dubai\u2018s \ncorporate tax is very low (14.4 percent), which can rival many competitors (GFCI3 \n2008: 40). In Dubai, given the depletion of oil, financial services (increasingly \nimportant) are still in competition with other government investment, tourist industry, \nmega property projects, etc. Dubai is having a diversified development strategy, \nwhich means government attention may be less concentrated, resulting in a possible \nless resolute support when facing the financial crisis. In addition, argued by Mishkin, \nGood institutions, however, need to be home grown; \u2026 The development of \ngood institutions in the advanced countries took hundreds of years as they grew \nand adapted to local conditions. Poor countries must ultimately develop their \nown institutions, and the citizens of these nations must feel they have ownership \nof those institutions or else the institutions will be ineffective and short-lived. \n(2006:13) \n \n 16 \nDIFC is like one country having two systems. Natural alienation therefore derives \nbetween the DIFC and the rest of the society, which is not especially healthy. How \nwell DIFC can integrate Dubai\u2018s social and economic environment? With the \nopportunities from the oil, financial centers and real estates, moreover, \u2015many \nnationals themselves have become rentiers in their own right, as the diversifying \neconomy has provided them with opportunities to become landlords\u2016 (Davidson 2008: \n178). That will translate into an ethos of procrastination and inefficiency. In the long-\nrun, Dubai may lose its competitiveness. \n \nDIFC after the 2008-09 Financial Crisis \nAccording to the analysis of the IMF, the plunge of the oil prices as a result of the \nfinancial crisis, hit hard the economies of the Middle East. The fact is that, according \nto the World Economic Outlook, April 2009, \u2015Among the oil-producing countries, the \nsharpest slowdown is expected in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), \u2026 A major \nfinancial center, UAE will also suffer from the contraction in global finance and \nmerger and acquisition activity.\u2016 (IMF 2009: 91)  \n \nNot only the Middle East in general and the UAE in particular did not live up to the \nexpectation of many developed countries to come to rescue the global financial \nturmoil, but also did they turn to more in-ward looking strategies. Before the first G20 \nSummit in November 2008 in Washington, Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister of the \nUK, paid visit to the Gulf States (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE) to persuade the \noil-rich countries to contribute to the IMF in the G20 Summit in Washington. Yet, \nKing Abdullah of Saudi Arabia did not pledge any contribution during the Summit, \nbut blamed the unregulated global financial institution. As a result, he announced a \nfive-year development project of UD$400 billion to establish Saudi\u2018s infrastructure. \n(Momani 2009: 17) Similarly, other Gulf States (including UAE) followed suit and \nannounced their own domestic stimulation plan. In fact, even from the social level, the \ngeneral public of the Gulf did not support the injection of money to the IMF. Between \nNovember 18 to 24, 2008, a survey was conducted across the Gulf and the Middle \nEast on the opinion of the injection of money to the IMF, among the 1,119 \nrespondents, 65 percent disagreed, 18 percent agreed and 17 percent did not know. \n(ibid, 19) \n \n 17 \nAlthough the Gulf Central Bank (GCB) has long been perceived among the member \nstates, the financial crisis inevitably compounded the move toward a much closer \nmonetary union. The Ministry of Economy and Finance from the GCC met on \nSeptember 17-18, 2008 and recommended the proposal for the Gulf Monetary Union \n(GMU), which was approved in Muscat in December 2008. (Saidi and Scacciavillani \n2009: 25) Some key institutional frameworks of the GMU are as follows: \n1. Inflation rates should not exceed by more than 2 percent the weighted \naverage of inflation rates in the GCC. \n2. Average short-term interest rates should not exceed by more than 2 percent \nthe average of the lowest three rates. \n3. Foreign exchange reserves should cover goods imports for at least four \nmonths. \n4. Annual fiscal deficit should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product. \n5. The public debt ratio should not exceed 60 percent of GDP for the public \ngovernment and 70 percent of GDP for the central government. \n6. The GCC currencies should maintain a fixed peg to the U.S. dollar. \n(ibid: 27-28) \n \nThe deadline for a common currency in the GCC should be in January 2010, yet, \nincentive among the member states in the Gulf is not particularly strong. According to \nthe assessment of the Gulf Research Council, everything is a big change. The switch \nover from national currency to common currency, the implementation of the monetary \nunion and the legal aspects all require time and adjustment of the member countries. \n(The GRC Economic Research Bulletin 2008: 27) As we have discussed, the Gulf \nstate did not feel strongly to help the international financial system after the financial \ncrisis. Yet, a sense of regionalism has been geared up because of the global financial \ncrisis.   \n \nShanghai and Dubai as Emerging Financial Powerhouses? \n \nDeveloping countries and emerging economies face a dilemma in terms of financial \nliberalization and the opening of the domestic financial market. According to Louis \nPauly,  \n 18 \nThey discovered too that such movements could be triggered not only by any \nobjectively reasonable loss of confidence by those investors in the integrity of \ndomestic financial institutions or in the value of the national currency; they \ncould be triggered by confidence-sapping shocks originating far away. \n(2008: 267) \n \nTo make profit and to do well in the financial industry, emerging countries should be \nable to establish a financial institution that can support the international financial \nsystem (Mishkin 2006: 12). Shanghai and Dubai therefore can set an example to the \nglobal financial market that emerging financial centers can become responsible stake-\nholders to shoulder global financial system. Shanghai has developed the state-of-the-\nart infrastructure and government incentives (as international financial center in China \nin 2020). Dubai has been able to use the Common Law system in the DIFC to \nfacilitating any economic transaction. Those are good signs to bring international \nfinancial system back into the soul of the emerging financial center.  \n \nOne key challenge behind Shanghai and Dubai is that they are all back up by the \ngovernment. The central question investor will ask is that will the government \nintervene the financial center at will? What would be the benefit of having certain \nlevel of government back up? We may want to take the clock back to the Asian \nfinancial crisis in 1997 and to locate any lessons. \n \nMore and more literatures nowadays suggest that a certain degree of government \nintervention was essential to restore confidence of the societies that were bombarded \nheavily by the Asian financial crisis. According to Stefanie Walter\u2018s study, only Hong \nKong was successful in defending its exchange rate stability whilst keeping away the \nmoney speculators between July 1997 and August 1998. Hong Kong relied heavily on \nits financial and banking sector which contributed almost 85 percent of its GDP (2008: \n428). In facing the financial crisis, Hong Kong Monetary Authority faced a dilemma, \neither to follow the purely market force by de-linking the pegging exchange rate \nbetween Hong Kong dollars and U.S. dollars or to heavily intervene in the stock \nmarket and to use a visible hand to safeguard the exchange rate. In balancing the cost \nand benefit, the Hong Kong government determined to go for intervention because \n\u2015Policymakers were aware of the private sectors preferences\u2026 During that year the \n 19 \nauthorities made it clear that exchange rate stability was their top policy priority\u2016 \n(Walter 2008: 429). \n \nThe experience of far reaching consequences of the Asian financial crisis and \nsuccessfulness of Hong Kong are useful in creating a platform for our discussion of \nthe development of the international financial centers in Shanghai and Dubai. The \ncentral argument is that only when financial services have reached to a critical mass -\nare international financial centers strategically important to governments and the \n\u2017national interest\u2018 and thus necessary to safe-guard in an emergency. Of course, the \ncollapse of the Northern Rock in the United Kingdom and its eventual taken over by \nthe government proved something wrong about the myth of \u2017too big to fail\u2018. The \ncurrent global financial crisis suggests that state rescue plans and direct \u2017buy-in\u2018 from \nthe banking sectors are dramatic measures which are needed at such a critical juncture, \njustifying some degree of the presence of the government in the financial system. \nThese seem to be emerging issues in relation to derive a useful platform between \ngovernment support and market incentive in the future global financial development. \n \nConclusion \n \nIn a nutshell, both Shanghai and Dubai are considered to have advantages in some \ntangible factors, such as tax incentive, infrastructure and volume of trading. Their \ncreation of international financial centers needs further testing to see whether they can \nperform well in the sea of financial market. The 2008-2009 financial crisis in the U.S. \nwas perceived very differently between Shanghai and Dubai. Shanghai has become \nmore proactive in creating its status as international financial center. Dubai has \nbecome more conservative and looks more in-ward, with a view to further develop its \nregional strength by expanding the GCC Monetary Union. Whether there is any \nfundamental change of the structure of the international financial system after the new \nglobal financial crisis is not yet materialized. Nevertheless, after a topsy-turvy global \nfinancial crisis from the Wall Street in October 2008, according to Jonathan Garner \nand other Morgan Stanley strategies, \u2017We believe the world economy is in a painful \ntransition to becoming emerging markets-led.\u2018 For the time being, therefore, our cases \nof Shanghai and Dubai will certainly make a good argument about how and in what \n 20 \nways financial centers can achieve a balance between money, market and state \ninvolvement in the coming new era of the global financial system. \n \n 21 \n \nNotes: \n \n                                                 \n1\n Various versions of this paper was presented in the East Asia\u2013Gulf Workshop co-\norganized by the Centre for the Advanced Studies of the Arab World (CASAW) at \nDurham University and the Gulf Research Center on October 22\u201323, 2008 in Dubai \nand China in the Arab World and Emerging East Asia-Middle East Nexus Workshop \norganized by CASAW on September 29-30, 2009 at Durham University, United \nKingdom.

See (The Independent, April 3, 2009, p. 8) \n \n3\n George Soros was born in 1930 in Budapest, Hungary. He graduated at London \nSchool of Economics in 1952, influenced hugely by Karl Popper. He emigrated to the \nUnited States in 1956. By 1969, his Quantum Fund was launched. It was a huge \nsuccess. For instance, if you invested U.S.$1,000 in 1969, you could obtain \nU.S.$2,150,000 in 1994, a compound growth of 35 percent. In 1979, He launched \nOpen Society Fund (donated $350Mn in 1996). One of his most famous (you may say \nnotorious) moves was to speculate on British Sterling in 1992, earning U.S.$1 billion \nin just a few days. After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, he was condemned by then \nMalaysia\u2018s Prime Minister bin Mahathir in a World Bank meeting in Hong Kong in \nSeptember 1997 as a menace. Starting from 2002, he was investigated by the U.S. \ngovernment. He has been a prolific writer in condemning the government of George \nW.
