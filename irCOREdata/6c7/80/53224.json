Introduction \nThe knowledge of how far a laser beam is absorbed by a material\u2019s surface is of fundamental interest, \nsince the outcomes of many laser processing procedures are intrinsically influenced by this \nparameter. Indeed, such information is essential to scientists and engineers interested in the laser \nprocessing of concrete. To date, many studies have been carried out to investigate the laser \nprocessing of cement and concrete. Most of the research, however, has concentrated on the laser \ncutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using high power CO2 lasers [1-3], the sealing\/fixing \nradioactive contamination onto concrete surfaces [4-7] and the production of novel surfaces [8-10] by \nmeans of CO2 laser glazing of the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of the concrete. In all of \nthese studies, however, spallation and excessive cracking and porosity formation were found to be \nmajor problems undermining the performance of the laser glazed region. In contrast, the treatment of \nthe OPC surface of concrete using a high power diode laser (HPDL) has been shown to effect a glaze \nthat does not suffer from spallation or display excessive cracking and porosity formation [11-13]. It is \nbelieved that the absorption length of the laser radiation for the OPC surface of the concrete has a \nsignificant influence on these observed differences in performance.  \n2. Experimental procedures \nIn this work a CO2 laser (Rofin-Sinar) emitting at 10.6\u00b5m with a maximum output power of 1 kW and \na HPDL (Diomed) emitting at 810\u00b120nm with a maximum output power of 60 W were employed. \nThe CO2 laser beam was delivered to the work surface by focusing the beam through a 150 mm focal \nlength KC1 lens to give a stable diverging beam. The HPDL beam was delivered to the work area by \nmeans of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 \nfocusing lens assembly. In both instances the laser optics were protected by means of a coaxially \nblown Ar shield gas jet a rate of 5 l min-1. Both lasers produced a multi-mode beam. The laser \nfluences were set such that no melting occurred. The absence of melting was verified by subjecting \nthe irradiated areas to an X-ray diffraction (XRD) to ensure the OPC retained its crystallinity. In \norder to obtain results of a practical and useful nature the cement used in the experiments was the \ncommon \u2018as cast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete. In this case the OPC surface of the concrete had a \nthickness of 2.5 mm. For the purpose of experimental convenience the as-received concrete blocks \n  4 \nwere sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x 20 mm) prior to laser treatment. The cement was treated \nwith both lasers at room temperature and in normal atmospheric conditions.  \n3. Results and discussion \nAs one can see from figure 1 and figure 2, the ablation depth rate per shot, h, for the OPC surface of \nthe concrete irradiated with both lasers was seen to exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the laser \nfluence, E. An optical profiling system (ProScan) was employed to determine the values of h for the \nvarious values of E. It is evident from both figure 1 and figure 2 that a threshold for discernible \nmaterial removal exists, with the minimum required fluence being approximately 68 J cm-2 for the \nCO2 laser and approximately 135 J cm\n-2 for the HPDL. Although this approach has been adopted \npreviously to examine pulsed lasers (excimer) and shown to be sound [14], the technique has also \nbeen used to investigate continuous wave (CW) lasers [15]. Moreover, the distinct linearity of the \ndata points further validates the use of this approach for the examination of CW lasers. It is important \nto note that this would assume a minimum conduction loss. However, concrete has relatively low \nthermal conductivity, thus it is reasonable to suppose the laser power densities used were high \nenough and the pulses short enough to minimise the thermal conduction loss. \nSince the energy deposition profile will be governed by the optical absorption coefficient, \u03b1, then the \ndepth of material removed per shot, h, is given by Beer-Lambert\u2019s law: \n h\nE\nE\nt\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n1\n\u03b1\nln  (1) \nwhere, Et, is the threshold value of the fluence at which significant material removal occurs and is \ndefined as [14] \n \n( )\nE\nH C T\nR\nt\np d=\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c1\n\u03b1 1\n (2) \nHere, H is the latent heat of fusion, \u03c1 the density, Cp the specific heat and R the reflectivity. Td is \nsome critical temperature at which rapid thermal degradation of the material occurs leading to the \nproduction of volatile fragments within the thermal time scale of the experiments. It is important to \nnote that (1) takes no account of absorption of incident radiation by the plume of removed material \nand likely changes in the material\u2019s level of absorption as removal progresses. Nonetheless, as the \n  5 \nwork of Andrew et al. [14] and Schmidt et al. [15] demonstrated, this simple form of the expression \nis quite adequate as a first approximation. By rearranging (1) in terms of the absorption length, 1\/\u03b1, \nthus: \n \n1\n\u03b1\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\nh\nE\nE\nt\nln\n (3) \nthen it is possible to determine the absorption length of both CO2 and HPDL radiation into the OPC \nsurface of the concrete. By introducing the ablation depth rate per shot, h, and the corresponding \nvalue of laser fluence, E, for each data point into (3) it was possible to calculate the average \nabsorption length for each laser under the actual experimental conditions. These were found to be \n1\/\u03b1=470\u00b122 \u00b5m for the CO2 laser and 1\/\u03b1=177\u00b115 \u00b5m for the HPDL. \n4. Conclusions \nBy employing Beer-Lambert\u2019s law, the laser beam absorption lengths of CO2 and a high power diode \nlaser (HPDL) radiation for concrete were determined. The absorption lengths for concrete of CO2 and \na HPDL radiation were 470\u00b122 \u00b5m and 177\u00b115 \u00b5m respectively. The principal factors that may \ninfluence the melt depth differences are arguably the absorption length and the actual absorptivity of \nthe OPC surface of the concrete. But, absorptivity measurements made at room temperature using \nspectrometers suitable for each laser wavelength revealed that the OPC surface of the concrete \nabsorbed around 75% of CO2 laser radiation and around 69% of HPDL radiation. Thus, since these \nfigures are similar, it is reasonable to assume that absorption length is the principal influence on the \nmelt depth. \n \n  6 \nReferences \n1.
