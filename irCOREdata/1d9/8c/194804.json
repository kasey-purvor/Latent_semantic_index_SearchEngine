INTRODUCTION\nThe existence in spiral galaxies of off-nuclear X-ray sources\nwhose luminosities appear significantly larger than the Ed-\ndington limit for a 1 M, object has been known for some time\n(Fabbiano 1989). These sources are distinct from the weak\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) present in many spiral galaxies\nknown as LINERs (Ho et al. 1997), although in at least one\ncase (M33; see Dubus et al. 1997) they may be confused with\nAGNs. Recently, considerable effort has been devoted to in-\nterpreting the properties of these ultraluminous compact X-ray\nsources (ULXs; e.g., Makishima et al. 2000 and references\ntherein). A key to understanding their nature may be that they\nappear to occur preferentially, although not exclusively, in\nregions of star formation (Zezas, Georgantopoulos, & Ward\n1999; Roberts & Warwick 2000; Fabbiano, Zezas, & Murray\n2001). In this Letter, we investigate models for the ULXs.\nBright, nonnuclear X-ray point sources in galaxies are di-\nvided into two groups: (1) accreting neutron stars and black\nholes and (2) young supernova remnants. The luminosities of\nthe first group, but not the second, are constrained by the Ed-\ndington limit:\n4pGM m c1 p 38 \u00011L \u0001 L \u0001 \u0001 1.3# 10 m ergs s , (1)X Edd 1\njT\nwhere jT is the Thomson cross section and is the accretorm1\nmass in units of solar mass. This constraint applies to anyM1\nnonexplosive source, whether powered by accretion or other\nmeans such as nuclear burning.\nEvasions of the limit are possible but rare. In the transient\nsystem A0538\u000166, a magnetic neutron star accretes from the\nwind of a Be-star companion. The system sometimes has super-\nEddington luminosities ergs s\u00011 (White & Carpenter39L \u0001 10X\n1978), but these may result from the reduction in the electron-\n1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, University\nRoad, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK; ark@star.le.ac.uk.\n2 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cam-\nbridge, MA 02138.\nscattering cross section below jT in the \u223c1011 G magnetic field\nof the neutron star pervading the accretion columns. Thus, if\nwe regard the observed variability of ULXs as ruling out the\nidentification as supernova remnants, a straightforward inter-\npretation as nonexplosive sources requires black holes with\nmasses M,, accreting at rates that on occasionM \u0002 50\u20131001\ncan exceed \u223c10\u00016 M, yr\u00011. As we shall see, while individual\nULXs could harbor such masses, there are major difficulties\nwith such a picture as an explanation for the ULXs as a class.\nAccordingly, we consider models in which the X-ray emission\nis assumed to be significantly beamed. In this case, ULXs may\ncorrespond to a relatively short-lived but common epoch of the\nevolution of close intermediate- or high-mass X-ray binaries,\nperhaps the thermal-timescale mass transfer phase following\nthe normal X-ray phase.\n2. LUMINOSITIES, LIFETIMES, MASSES, AND BIRTHRATES\nWe first consider the restrictions placed by observation on\naccretion models for the ULXs. We assume that a compact\nobject of mass accretes from a mass reservoir (e.g., a com-M1\npanion star) of mass . We denote the mean observed numberM2\nof ULXs per galaxy as n, the beaming factor as b (pQ\/4p,\nwhere Q is the solid angle of emission), the duty cycle (which\nequals the time that the source is active as a fraction of its\nlifetime) as d, and define an \u201cacceptance rate\u201d a as the ratio\nof mass accreted by to that lost by , i.e., the mean ac-M M1 2\ncretion rate . We further define as the ap-\u02d9 \u02d9M p a(\u0001M ) L1 2 sph\nparent X-ray (assumed bolometric) luminosity of a source,\ngiven by the assumption of isotropic (spherical) emission, and\nlet . From these definitions, it follows40 \u00011L p L \/10 ergs s40 sph\nthat the luminosity\n40 \u00011Lp bL p 10 bL ergs s (2)sph 40\nand the minimum accretor mass, if the source is not to exceed\nL110 ULTRALUMINOUS X-RAY SOURCES Vol. 552\nthe Eddington limit, is\n2M \u0002 10 bL M .

(8)6t bd 10 m a m a2 2\nIt is important to note here that the required birthrate is in-\ndependent of beaming (and the duty cycle): the greater intrinsic\nsource population N required by beamed sources with bd ! 1\n(see eq. [4]) is compensated by their longer lifetimes (see\neq. [7]).\n3. UNBEAMED MODELS\nFor an unbeamed model, we set and recover frombp 1\nequation (3) the requirement that . We note im-2M \u0002 10 L1 40\nmediately that some ingenuity is required (see Makishima et\nal. 2000) to make these masses compatible with the charac-\nteristic observed X-ray temperatures of 1\u20132 keV, whereas these\nare natural values for the lower masses that we shall find below\nfor beamed models. With , equation (5) gives \u0002\u02d9bp 1 Mactive\n. This effectively forces the mass reservoir to\u00016 \u0001110 L M yr40 ,\nbe a companion star; except for extremely high black hole\nmasses , Bondi accretion from even a rel-4M \u0002 3# 10 M1 ,\natively dense part of the interstellar medium (ISM) is inade-\nquate, giving a rate of\n2 \u000124 \u00013m (r\/10 g cm )100\u000111 \u00011\n\u02d9M \u0001 1# 10 M yr , (9)Bondi ,2 2u \u0002 c10 10\nwhere M,, r is the mass density of the ambientm p M \/100100 1\nISM, and u10 and c10 are the relative speed of the hole and local\nISM and the local ISM sound speed, respectively, both in units\nof 10 km s . While individual ULXs might contain black holes\u00011\nof masses , it seems improbable that gal-4M \u0002 3# 10 M1 ,\naxies like the Antennae should contain about 10 accreting ex-\namples. Unbeamed models for the ULX class thus have to\ninvoke a class of extremely massive X-ray binaries. As we\nshall see, this may be a potential problem. Accepting that suit-\nable binaries could in principle form, there are the usual con-\nstraints familiar from low-mass X-ray binary evolution (see\nKalogera & Webbink 1996). Particularly important are that\n(1) the binary must be wide enough so that the progenitor of\nthe compact star (here an \u223c100 M, black hole) is able to fit\ninside its Roche lobe (otherwise it will provoke common-\nenvelope evolution) and (2) the binary must be able to provide\nthe inferred minimum accretion rate . The\u00016 \u00011\u02d9M \u223c 10 M yr1 ,\nfirst constraint immediately sets a scale since main-sequence\nstars of masses \u0002100 M, have radii \u0002103 R, (e.g., Stothers\n& Chin 1999). Using Kepler\u2019s law and assuming ,M k M1 2\nthis implies binary periods\n\u00010.5P \u0002 1m yr. (10)100\nWe can compare this with the critical period beyond which the\naccretion disk around the black hole cannot be thermally stable,\nand the system must therefore be transient. From King (2000),\nwe find that\n1\/8 1\/8P \u223c 4m m days. (11)crit 100 2\nWe see that unbeamed ULXs must be transient. Hence, the in-\nferred now refers to the outburst state only:\u00016 \u00011\u02d9M \u223c 10 M yr1 ,\nthis is advantageous since persistent mass transfer rates \u0001 of\u02d9M2\nthis order would have been difficult to explain. To fill the Roche\nlobe in a binary with the period given by equation (10) requires\nan extended star (note that the binary period essentially fixes the\nmean density of this star uniquely; see, e.g., Frank, King, &\nRaine 1992). From the formulae of King (1988; see Ritter 1999),\nwe see that an evolved star with a helium core mass M \u223cc\nwill fill the Roche lobe, independently of the total0.4\u20130.5 M,\ndonor mass . Mass transfer is driven by the nuclearM 1 M2 c\nexpansion of the star, at the rate of\n\u00017 0.93 1.47 \u00011\n\u02d9\u0001M \u0001 1# 10 P m M yr , (12)2 yr 2 ,\nwhere is the binary period in years (see eq. [7] of King,Pyr\nKolb, & Burderi 1996). Thus, even a duty cycle d as long as\n10% would yield mean accretion rates of the required order;\ni.e., during outbursts.\u00011 \u00016 \u00011\u02d9 \u02d9 \u02d9M p M p M d \u223c 10 M yr1 active 1 ,\nHowever, applying the simple irradiated-disk theory of King\n& Ritter (1998), we predict that the accretion rate should\u02d9Mactive\ndecay linearly from its initial peak down to zero on a 10\u201320 yr\ntimescale. This is not easily compatible with a comparison of\nROSAT and Chandra data. This may not be a crucial objection\nto this type of unbeamed model for ULXs; the theory of outbursts\nin large irradiated disks is complicated, even without adding\nfurther difficulties such as radiation-induced disk warping.\nA more serious objection to unbeamed models is the one\ntouched on above, namely, that they require an \u223c100 M, black\nhole to coexist in a binary with an evolved companion star.\nMass loss from very massive stars with nonzero metallicity is\nusually thought to be so strong that the final black hole mass\nis much smaller than the initial stellar mass (see Baraffe, Heger,\n& Woosley 2001 for a recent view and Papaloizou 1973 for a\npossible objection). Assuming coeval formation of the two stars\nin the binary rules out a primordial origin for the black hole\nprogenitor and would thus require a progenitor with a mass\nk100 M,. If the initial mass function within the stellar clusters\nis close to that of Salpeter, we conclude that the number of\nstars formed having masses \u2265100 M, is a factor of \u223c100 lower\nNo. 2, 2001 KING ET AL. L111\nthan the number of stars having initial masses in the range\n. We would therefore expect X-ray bi-10 M \u2264 m \u2264 100 M, ,\nnaries containing neutron stars and lower mass black holes to\noutnumber markedly those containing higher mass black holes.\nThe X-ray luminosities of the systems observed in the Antennae\n(Fabbiano et al. 2001) contradict this, assuming that all systems\nare unbeamed, although the number of low-luminosity systems\nis not currently well known.\nAlternatively, an \u223c100 M, black hole may have only re-\ncently gained a new stellar partner. Such black holes may be\nproduced within dense clusters through the merger of lower\nmass black holes (see, e.g., Lee 1993, 1995). Indeed, this has\nbeen proposed as the origin of the moderate-mass black hole\ninferred to be present in the central regions of M82 (Matsushita\net al. 2000; Matsumoto et al. 2001; Kaaret et al. 2001). Al-\nthough it is possible that a moderate-mass black hole produced\nin a central cluster of M82 has gained a stellar companion by\nsome dynamical process (tidal capture or via an exchange en-\ncounter involving a binary), this scenario is unlikely to work\nfor the systems observed in the Antennae, where the ULXs are\nobserved to be strongly associated with the young star clusters\nthat are located some distance from the galactic nuclei (Fab-\nbiano et al. 2001). Any massive black hole would therefore\nhave to be formed within these stellar clusters and not within\nthe nuclear clusters. To produce moderate-mass black holes\nwithin a cluster via the successive merger of lower mass ob-\njects, the potential well of the cluster has to be sufficiently deep\nto retain the black holes. This can be the case for a stellar\ncluster in the nucleus of a galaxy but is not true for globular\nclusters in which the typical escape speed is far too low to\nretain black hole binaries as they are hardened via encounters.\nThis has been suggested as the reason for the absence of black\nhole binary systems in globular clusters (Sigurdsson & Hern-\nquist 1993; Kulkarni, Hut, & McMillan 1993).\nA population of \u223c100 M, black holes originating from a\nmuch earlier generation of effectively zero-metallicity stars\nseems unlikely to explain the ULXs observed in the Antennae\n(Fabbiano et al. 2001) since these black holes would be dis-\ntributed throughout the galactic halo, and so the probability of\npicking up stars from the young stellar clusters via dynamical\nencounters within the last \u223c107 yr is extremely low.\n4. BEAMED MODELS\nSince unbeamed models run into difficulties because of the\nrequired black hole mass of \u223c100 M, and the need for a com-\npanion, we consider the effect of assuming that the observed X-\nrays are mildly beamed. The simplest candidate mechanism is\nthe idea that the accretion disk around an accreting black hole\nhas a much lower scattering optical depth over a restricted range\nof solid angles (e.g., the rotational poles) than in other directions.\nAlmost all the emitted X-rays would therefore emerge in these\ndirections. A beaming factor would bring the requiredb \u0001 0.1\nminimum accretor mass (see eq. [3]) into the range of M1 \u0001\n10 M, commonly found in dynamical measurements of X-ray\nbinaries, particularly quiescent soft X-ray transients (e.g., Charles\n1998), while would bring down to neutron starb \u0001 0.01 M1\nvalues. In addition, this kind of disk geometry, i.e., a thick disk\nwith a central funnel, may actually radiate a total luminosity in\nexcess of the Eddington limit (Jaroszynski, Abramowicz, &\nPaczyn\u00b4ski 1980; Abramowicz, Calvani, & Nobili 1980). Thus,\nsuch modest b-values may allow quite large apparent luminos-\nities for perfectly standard black hole or neutron star masses.\nThe obvious implication is that beamed ULXs might represent\nsome short-lived phase in the evolution of a large class of\nX-ray binaries; from equation (7), we find that t \u0001\nyr.710 m a\/(b\/0.1)d2\nA good candidate for such a phase is an episode of thermal-\ntimescale mass transfer. These are extremely common, occur-\nring when the donor has a radiative envelope and either (a) is\nsomewhat more massive than the accretor and\/or (b) first fills\nits Roche lobe as it expands across the Hertzsprung gap. In\ngeneral, both cases give rise to highly super-Eddington mass\ntransfer rates. Case a is unavoidable, for example, in any neu-\ntron star binary with an intermediate mass (\u223c2\u20134 M, donor);\nKing & Ritter (1999) and Podsiadlowski & Rappaport (2000)\nshow that Cygnus X-2 is a survivor of such an episode, in\nwhich \u0001 reached values of order \u223c10\u00016 M, yr\u00011 and the\u02d9M2\nexcess mass transfer is simply blown away from the system\nrather than resulting in common-envelope evolution (see also\nKing & Begelman 1999 and Kolb et al. 2000). Case b requires\nonly a reasonably wide binary separation after formation of the\ncompact star and clearly benefits from a large initial phase\nspace. Either case a or case b is also the likely path for all\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries such as Cyg X-1 once the current\nwind-fed X-ray phase ends.\nUntil recently, it has generally been assumed that thermal-\ntimescale episodes are unobservable because they are short and\nthat, without beaming, X-rays could not emerge from the super-\nEddington accretion flow at all. We investigate here the pos-\nsibility that ULXs could be systems in this phase, where beam-\ning allows us to see the X-rays.\nThe thermal-timescale mass transfer rate from a donor near\nthe upper main sequence is roughly (see King & Begelman\n1999)\n\u00018 2.6 \u00011\n\u02d9\u0001m \u0001 3# 10 m M yr . (13)2 2 ,\nComparing with the Eddington accretion rate, we can calculate\nan acceptance rate of\n\u00012.6ap 0.43m m (14)1 2\nand thus a lifetime (assuming )dp 1\n6 \u00011 \u00011 \u00011.6t \u0001 4.3# 10 (b\/0.1) L m m yr (15)40 1 2\nand birthrate\n\u00016 \u00011 1.6 \u00011B \u0002 2.3# 10 n(b\/0.1)L m m yr (16)40 1 2\nper galaxy. In particular, for a system like Cyg X-2, which has\nM, and M, (King & Ritter 1999; Podsiad-m \u0001 1.4 m \u0001 31 2\nlowski & Rappaport 2000; Kolb et al. 2000), we get a required\nbirthrate\n\u00016 \u00011B \u0002 1# 10 n(b\/0.1)L yr . (17)40\nWe may compare this with the Galactic birthrate of \u223c10\u00016 to\n10\u00017 yr\u00011 deduced for Cyg X-2\u2013like systems (King & Ritter\n1999; Podsiadlowski & Rappaport 2000; Kolb et al. 2000). For\na high-mass black hole system like Cyg X-1, both andm1\nare probably significantly higher, raising B by as much asm2\nan order of magnitude. However, the short X-ray lifetime of\n\u223c105 yr of this X-ray phase requires a correspondingly high\nGalactic birthrate of approximately a few times 10\u00015 yr\u00011, again\nallowing a significant ULX population. X-ray binaries reach\nL112 ULTRALUMINOUS X-RAY SOURCES Vol. 552\nthe thermal-timescale phase in a timescale comparable with the\nmain-sequence lifetime of the donor. Thus, ULXs descending\nfrom high-mass X-ray binaries would naturally be associated\nwith a young stellar population, as required by observation.\nA possible example of a ULX in the Galaxy is GRS\n1915\u0002105, where ergs s\u00011 (e.g., Belloni et al.39L \u223c 1# 10X\n1997). Since this is a microquasar, with a radio jet axis at about\n70\u0002 to the line of sight (see Mirabel & Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez 1999), only\nmild beaming ( ) is possible, even assuming that we viewb \u223c 0.6\nthe system at the edge of the X-ray beam. However, this is\nindeed sufficient to reduce the luminosity to sub-Eddington\nvalues. Moreover, such a geometrical alignment is quite rea-\nsonable since it offers an explanation for the very unusual long-\nterm behavior of GRS 1915\u0002105. The system was not detected\nin X-rays until 1992, and since then it has remained persistently\nbright with only short interruptions. The usual explanation that\nthis is an accretion disk instability, prolonged by self-irradiation\nby X-rays (see King & Ritter 1998), would require an im-\nplausibly large disk mass. An attractive alternative is that the\nX-ray light curve reflects slight changes in the X-ray beaming,\nwhich would have decreased enough in 1992 to allow us to\nsee the X-rays.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have considered models for the ULX class and reached\nthe following conclusions:\n1. Unbeamed models probably require a black hole of\nM, in an \u223c1 yr binary orbit with an evolved donorM \u0002 1001\nstar. Forming such a system presents considerable difficulties,\nand even then the likely transient behavior of the accretion disk\nin such a wide system is hard to reconcile with observation.\nIt is still possible that an individual ULX may contain a very\nmassive black hole ( M,), perhaps accreting4M \u0002 3# 101\nfrom the ISM.\n2. The assumption of mild beaming ( ) reducesb \u223c 0.1\u20130.01\nto values already observed for Galactic X-ray binaries andM1\nsuggests that ULXs represent a short-lived phase of their evo-\nlution. The most likely candidate for this is the thermal-timescale\nmass transfer episode that is inevitable in a very wide class of\nintermediate- and high-mass X-ray binaries. This in turn suggests\na link to the Galactic microquasars (see the remarks by A. R.\nKing quoted in Mirabel & Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez 1999). The short donor\nlifetime in high-mass X-ray binaries would explain why ULXs\nare associated with young stellar populations.\nThe major theoretical uncertainty for the second conclusion\nis whether or not beaming is a natural consequence of high\naccretion rates. Only large numerical simulations can address\nthis question. For this type of model, it is perhaps encouraging\nto know that not only are the X-ray spectra fairly similar to\nthose of Galactic black hole systems but that Kubota et al.\n(2001) observed X-ray spectral transitions typical of such a\nsource in two ULXs. The same type of spectral and timing\nvariability has also been seen in the X-9 source in the M81\nfield (La Parola et al. 2001). There are several possible ob-\nservational tests of these ideas. First, continued X-ray moni-\ntoring with a view to detecting possible changes in beaming\ngeometry is clearly worthwhile. We note, however, that X-ray\neclipses are unlikely in any beamed model, assuming that the\nX-ray beam axis is normal to the binary plane. Optical iden-\ntifications of ULXs might allow at least two kinds of test: If\nthe total X-ray luminosities really are as large as predicted if\nthere is no beaming, one might expect to detect photoionization\nnebulae around ULXs. If, on the other hand, ULXs are beamed,\nand thus of normal stellar mass, one might hope ultimately to\ndetect a spectroscopic period (say tens of days) in a ULX within\nthe Local Group.\nWe thank Mike Garcia, Jim Pringle, Hans Ritter, Tim Roberts,\nRashid Sunyaev, and Pete Wheatley for discussions.
