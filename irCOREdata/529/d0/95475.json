This paper reports on community perceptions of a 3-year project which sought to train and support volunteer health workers in a rural community in South Africa. Given the growing emphasis on involving community voices in project research, we conducted 17 discussions with 34 community members, including those involved and uninvolved in project activities \u2013 at the end of this 3-year period.

However, discussions suggested that it was unlikely that these efforts would be sustainable in the long term, due to lack of support for volunteers both within and outside of the community.
