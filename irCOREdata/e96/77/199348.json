Reduced form models have become important tools in the\nrisk management of credit risk [for background references see Jarrow and Yu\n(2001) and Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002)]. One reason for this is that they\nusually provide a better fit to market data than structural models do [see Jones,\nMason and Rosenfeld (1984), Jarrow, van Deventer and Wang (2002) and Eom,\nHelwege and Huang (2000)]. Reduced form models take a firm\u2019s default process\nas exogenous with the time of default a stopping time. When in addition the time\nis totally inaccessible, the market cannot predict the time of default. Yet, managers\nworking within a firm surely know when default is imminent. From a manager\u2019s\nperspective, default is an accessible stopping time (predictable). Usually, in the\nstructural approach default occurs when the firm\u2019s value, a continuous sample\npath process, hits a barrier. This formulation is consistent with the manager\u2019s\nperspective but inconsistent with reduced form models.\nDuffie and Lando (2001) link the two perspectives by introducing noise into the\nmarket\u2019s information set, transforming the manager\u2019s accessible default time from\nthe structural approach into the market\u2019s inaccessible default time of a reduced\nform model. Duffie and Lando postulate that the market can only observe the\nfirm\u2019s asset value plus noise at equally spaced, discrete time points (and not\ncontinuously). And, when default occurs, the market is immediately informed.\nThis noise generates the market\u2019s surprise with respect to default, because the\nReceived November 2002; revised March 2003.\nAMS 2000 subject classifications. 60H60, 60G46, 91B28.\nKey words and phrases.

Kusuoka (1999) extends Duffie and Lando\u2019s model\nto continuous time observations of the firm\u2019s asset value plus noise. Kusuoka\u2019s\nsolution is an application of continuous time filtering theory.\nThis approach to constructing a reduced form credit model presumes that\nthe market has the same information set as the firm\u2019s management, but with\nnoise appended. (Filtering theory was originally formulated for electronic signal\nprocessing where the physical problem corresponds to a situation where an\nelectronic signal is received with noise and the noise needs to be \u201cfiltered\u201d out.)\nAn interpretation is that accounting reports and\/or management press releases\neither purposefully (e.g., Enron) or inadvertently add extraneous information that\nobscures the market\u2019s knowledge of the firm\u2019s asset value. Management knows\nthe firm\u2019s value (because this knowledge determines default), but they cannot\n(or will not) make it known to the market. The market\u2019s task is to remove this\nextraneous noise. Although possible in many situations, this characterization of\nmanagement\u2019s information versus the market\u2019s is not exhaustive. An alternative\nand equally plausible characterization is that the market has the same information\nas a firm\u2019s management, but just less of it. Accounting reports and\/or management\npress releases provide just a reduced set of the information that is available.\nConsistent with this alternative perspective, we provide a second approach to the\nconstruction of a reduced form credit risk model from a structural model. In our\napproach, the firm\u2019s cash flows, a continuous sample path process, provide the\nsufficient statistic for default. If the firm\u2019s cash flows remain negative for an\nextended period of time, the firm after exhausting both its lines of credit and\neasily liquidated assets, defaults. Management observes the firm\u2019s cash flows.\nIn contrast, the market observes only a very coarse partitioning of the manager\u2019s\ninformation set. The market knows only that the cash flow is negative; the firm\nis experiencing financial distress and the duration of the negative cash flow event,\nnothing else. This information structure has default being an accessible stopping\ntime for management, but an inaccessible stopping time for the market, yielding\nthe reduced form credit risk model.\nTo illustrate the economic concepts involved, this paper concentrates on devel-\noping a specific example to obtain analytic results. The analytic results solidify\nintuition and make the economic arguments more transparent. Generalizations and\nextensions will be readily apparent once the example is well understood. It is our\nhope that this paper will motivate additional research into this area. Our example\nprovides an explicit representation of the firm\u2019s default intensity using an Az\u00e9ma\u2019s\nmartingale [see Emery (1989)]. To illustrate the usefulness of this result, we com-\npute the value of a risky zero-coupon bond using excursion theory of Brownian\nmotions. For another application of excursion theory to option pricing see Ches-\nney, Jeanblanc-Picqu\u00e9 and Yor (1997).\nAn outline for this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the structural model.\nSection 3 presents the reduced form model, Section 4 values a risky zero-coupon\nbond in the reduced form model, while Section 5 concludes the paper.\nCREDIT RISK AND PARTIAL INFORMATION 1169\n2. The structural model. We consider a continuous trading economy with\na money market account where default-free zero-coupon bonds are traded. In this\neconomy there is a risky firm with debt outstanding in the form of zero-coupon\nbonds. The details of these traded assets are not needed now, but will be provided\nlater as necessity dictates. The market for these traded securities is assumed to be\narbitrage free, but not necessarily complete.\nWe begin with a filtered probability space (\u0001,F , (Ft )0\u2264t\u2264T ,Q) satisfying the\nusual conditions. Time T > 0 is the final date in the model. The probability Q\nis an equivalent martingale probability measure under which the normalized prices\nof the traded securities follow a martingale. Normalization is by the value of the\nmoney market account. The no-arbitrage assumption guarantees the existence, but\nnot the uniqueness of such a probability measure [see Duffie (1996)].\n2.1. Management\u2019s information. Let X be the cash balances of the firm,\nnormalized by the value of the money market account, with the following\nstochastic differential equation:\ndXt = \u03c3 dWt, X0 = x(2.1)\nwith x > 0, \u03c3 > 0, and where W is a standard Brownian motion on the given\nprobability space.\nThe cash balances of the firm are initialized at x > 0 units of the money\nmarket account. One should interpret this quantity as the \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201coptimal\u201d\ncash balances for the firm. An optimal cash balance could exist because if the\nfirm holds too much cash, it forgoes attractive investment projects and incurs\nincreased tax liabilities, while if it has too little cash, it increases the likelihood\nof bankruptcy and the occurrence of third party costs [see Brealey and Myers\n(2001) for related discussion]. The firm attempts to maintain cash balances at this\ntarget level, but fluctuations occur due to its operating needs, for example, meeting\npayrolls, paying suppliers, receiving payments from accounts receivable, and so\non. However, without loss of generality, to simplify the presentation we assume\nthat x = 0 and \u03c3 = 1, as well.\nUnder the martingale measure, cash balances have no drift term. Under the\nempirical measure, however, one would expect that the cash balances should drift\nat the spot rate of interest. This is consistent with the firm holding its cash balances\nin the money market account and trying to maintain the target level balance.\nThe firm\u2019s management observes the firm\u2019s cash balances. Cash balances can be\npositive, zero or negative. Negative cash balances correspond to situations where\npayments owed are not paid, and the firm is in financial distress.\n2.2. The default process. Let Z := {t \u2208 [0, T ] :X(t) = 0} denote the times\nwhen the firm\u2019s cash balances hit zero. When the cash balances hit zero, the\nfirm has no cash left for making current payments owed. The firm is in financial\ndistress. With zero or negative cash balances, debt payments can only be made by\n1170 \u00c7ETIN, JARROW, PROTTER AND YILDIRIM\nliquidating the firm\u2019s assets or by accessing bank lines of credit. The firm can exist\nwith negative cash balances for only a limited period of time. We now formalize\nthis default process.\nAssociated with the zero set, we define the following function:\ng(t) := sup{s \u2264 t :Xs = 0}.\nThe random time g(t) corresponds to the last time (before t) that cash balances hit\nzero. Let\n\u03c4\u03b1 := inf\n{\nt > 0 : t \u2212 g(t) \u2265 \u03b1\n2\n2\n, where Xs < 0 for s \u2208 (g(t\u2212), t)\n}\nfor some \u03b1 \u2208 R+ be the random time that measures the onset of a potential default\nsituation for the firm. Formally, \u03c4\u03b1 is the first time that the firm\u2019s cash balances\nhave continued to be negative for at least \u03b12\/2 units of time. The constant \u03b1 is\na parameter of the default process (that could be estimated from market data).\nWe let \u03c4 denote the time of default. We assume that\n\u03c4 := inf{t > \u03c4\u03b1 :Xt = 2X\u03c4\u03b1}.\nDefault occurs the first time, after \u03c4\u03b1 , that the cash balances double in\nmagnitude. The intuition is that after being below zero for a long time, the firm\nuses up all its slack (lines of credit, etc.) to meet its debt payments. If it ever\nhits 2X\u03c4\u03b1 afterwards, it has no slack left, so it defaults. The doubling in absolute\nmagnitude of the cash balances prior to default is only for analytic convenience,\nand it has no economic content. The generalization of this assumption is a subject\nfor future research. The above process is what the firm\u2019s management observes.\n3. The reduced form model. This section studies the structural model under\nthe market\u2019s information set. It is shown here that the bankruptcy process, as\nviewed by the market, follows a reduced form model where the indicator function\nof the default time is a point process with an intensity.\nIn contrast to the manager\u2019s information, the market does not see the firm\u2019s cash\nbalances. Instead, until the firm has had prolonged negative cash balances for a\ncertain time, that is, until random time \u03c4\u03b1 , the market only knows when the firm has\npositive cash balances or when it has negative or zero cash balances, and whether\nthe cash balances are above or below the default threshold 2X\u03c4\u03b1 afterwards. In this\nrespect, we introduce a new process:\nYt =\n{\nXt , for t < \u03c4\u03b1,\n2X\u03c4\u03b1 \u2212 Xt, for t \u2265 \u03c4\u03b1.\nNote that Y is also an F -Brownian motion and\n\u03c4 = inf{t \u2265 \u03c4\u03b1 :Yt = 0}.\nCREDIT RISK AND PARTIAL INFORMATION 1171\nLet\nsign(x) =\n{1, if x > 0,\n\u22121, if x \u2264 0.\nSet G\u02dct := \u03c3 {sign(Ys); s \u2264 t} and let (Gt )0\u2264t\u2264T denote the Q-complete and right\ncontinuous version of the filtration (G\u02dct )0\u2264t\u2264T ; (Gt )0\u2264t\u2264T is the information set\nthat the market observes. As seen, the market\u2019s information set is a very coarse\nfiltering of the manager\u2019s information set. In essence, the market observes when\nthe firm is in financial distress, and the duration of this situation.\nGiven this information, the market values the firm\u2019s liabilities by taking\nconditional expectations under the martingale measure Q. This valuation is studied\nin the next section.\nWe now derive the intensity for the default time as seen by the market. Let\nY\u02dct = 2\/\u221a\u03c0Yt . Then signs and zero sets of Y and Y\u02dc are the same. Define Mt :=\nE[Y\u02dct |Gt ]. Then, M is the Az\u00e9ma\u2019s martingale on (\u0001, (Gt )0\u2264t\u2264T ,Q). [Note that\nAz\u00e9ma\u2019s martingale has already been used in finance, but in a diferent context;\nsee Dritschel and Protter (1999).] Its quadratic variation satisfies the following\n\u201cstructure equation\u201d:\nd[M,M]t = dt \u2212 Mt\u2212 dMt.(3.1)\nAz\u00e9ma\u2019s martingale is a strong Markov process. For an extensive treatment\nof Az\u00e9ma\u2019s martingale and the structure equation, see Emery (1989). We also have\nthe following formula for M :\nMt = sign(Yt)\n\u221a\n2\n\u221a\nt \u2212 g\u00aft ,(3.2)\nwhere g\u00aft := sup{s \u2264 t :Ys = 0}. It is easily seen that \u03c4 can be equivalently\nwritten as\n\u03c4 = inf{t > 0 :\u0006Mt \u2265 \u03b1}.\nTherefore, \u03c4 is a jump time of Az\u00e9ma\u2019s martingale, hence it is totally inaccessible\nin the filtration (Gt )0\u2264t\u2264T . Also note that \u03c4\u03b1 = inf{t > 0 :Mt\u2212 \u2264 \u2212\u03b1}.\nHowever, \u0006Mt = \u2212Mt\u22121[Mt\u2212\u0005=Mt ]. So, \u03c4\u03b1 \u2264 \u03c4 a.s. Furthermore, \u03c4\u03b1 is a\npredictable stopping time which implies Q[\u03c4 = \u03c4\u03b1] = 0. Hence, \u03c4\u03b1 < \u03c4 a.s.\nDefine Nt := 1[t\u2265\u03c4 ]. By the Doob\u2013Meyer decomposition [see, e.g., Protter\n(1990), page 90], there exists a continuous, increasing, and predictable (also known\nas locally natural) process, A, such that N \u2212 A is a G-martingale which has only\none jump, at \u03c4 , and of size equal to 1.\nTHEOREM 3.1. \u03c4 has a G-intensity, that is, A is of the form At = \u222b t\u2227\u03c40 \u03bbs ds.\nFurthermore, \u03bbt = 1[t>\u03c4\u03b1]1\/(2[t \u2212 g\u00aft\u2212]) for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4 , and \u03bbt = 0 for t > \u03c4 .\n1172 \u00c7ETIN, JARROW, PROTTER AND YILDIRIM\nPROOF. Let At = At\u2227\u03c4 . Then\nHt := Nt \u2212 At =\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nhs dMs(3.3)\nfor some G-predictable process hs since M possesses the predictable representa-\ntion property. [This is proved in Emery (1989).] Since A is continuous and of finite\nvariation, and N is a quadratic pure jump semimartingale, we have\n[H,H ]t = [N,N ]t = Nt.(3.4)\nAlso,\n[H,H ]t =\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s d[M,M]s\n(3.5)\n=\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s ds \u2212\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2sMs\u2212 dMs,\nwhere the second equality follows from (3.1). Combining (3.3)\u2013(3.5) yields\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s ds \u2212\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s Ms\u2212 dMs \u2212 At =\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nhs dMs,\nwhich implies\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s ds \u2212At =\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s Ms\u2212 dMs +\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nhs dMs.(3.6)\nThe left-hand side of the previous expression is continuous. Hence\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\n(h2sMs\u2212 + hs) dMs = 0.(3.7)\nWe compute the predictable quadratic variation to get\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s (hsMs\u2212 + 1)2 ds = 0.(3.8)\nThe optional sampling theorem implies that (N \u2212 A)t\u2227\u03c4\u03b1 = 0, since N = 0 before\nand at \u03c4\u03b1 . Therefore we get h = 0 on [0, \u03c4\u03b1]. On the other hand, (3.8) gives hs = 0\nor hs = \u22121\/Ms\u2212 on [\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4 ]. But (3.3) implies hs cannot be identically 0 on (\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4 ],\nand we see that hs = \u22121[s>\u03c4\u03b1]1\/Ms\u2212 satisfies (3.7). Therefore we deduce a version\nof H which is given by\nHt = \u2212\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\n1[s>\u03c4\u03b1]\n1\nMs\u2212\ndMs\nand thus H jumps only at \u03c4 and its jump size is given by\n\u0006H\u03c4 = \u22121[\u03c4>\u03c4\u03b1 ]\n1\nM\u03c4\u2212\n\u0006M\u03c4 = \u2212 1\nM\u03c4\u2212\n(\u2212M\u03c4\u2212) = 1.\nCREDIT RISK AND PARTIAL INFORMATION 1173\nTherefore, (3.6) and (3.7) together imply\nAt =\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\nh2s ds\n=\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0\n1[s\u2265\u03c4\u03b1]\n1\nM2s\u2212\nds. \u0001\nWe choose the intensity equal to 0 after time \u03c4 , although other choices might\nbe possible since we are dealing with\n\u222b t\u2227\u03c4\n0 \u03bbs ds. This theorem shows that under\nthe market\u2019s information set, default is given by a totally inaccessible stopping\ntime, generating a reduced form model from the market\u2019s perspective. We have\nan explicit representation of the intensity process as given by \u03bbt = 1[t>\u03c4\u03b1]1\/(2[t \u2212\ng\u00aft\u2212]). The firm\u2019s default intensity is zero until time \u03c4\u03b1 is reached. After time \u03c4\u03b1 , the\ndefault intensity declines with the length of time that the firm remains in financial\ndistress (t \u2212 g\u00aft\u2212). The interpretation is that the longer the firm survives in the\nstate of financial distress, the less likely it is to default. Presumably, the firm\nis more likely to recover and not reach the default magnitude of cash balances\ngiven by 2X\u03c4\u03b1 . With this intensity, the market can value risky bonds and credit\nderivatives. This valuation is discussed in the next section.\n4. Valuation of a risky zero-coupon bond. Perhaps one of the most\nimportant uses of reduced form credit risk models is to price risky bonds and\ncredit derivatives. This section studies the pricing of risky zero-coupon bonds.\nLet (St )t\u2208[0,T ] denote the price process of a risky zero coupon bond issued by\nthis firm that pays $1 at time T if no default occurs prior to that date, and zero\ndollars otherwise. Then, under the no arbitrage assumption, S is given by\nSt = E\n[\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b T\nt\nru du\n)\n1[\u03c4>T ]\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Gt\n]\n1[\u03c4>t],(4.1)\nwhere ru is the instantaneous interest rate at time u, and E refers to the expectation\nunder risk neutral probability law.\nTo facilitate the evaluation of expression (4.1), we will assume that interest rates\nare deterministic. In this case, the price of the risky bond becomes\nSt = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b T\nt\nru du\n)\nE\n[\n1[\u03c4>T ]\n\u2223\u2223Gt]1[\u03c4>t].(4.2)\nLet Vt = 1[t<T ]E[exp(\u2212 \u222b Tt \u03bbu du)|Gt ], where \u03bb is the intensity process as given\nin Theorem 3.1. Duffie, Schroder and Skiadas (1996) give the following formula\nfor E[1[\u03c4>T ]|Gt ]:\nE\n[\n1[\u03c4>T ]\n\u2223\u2223Gt ]= Vt \u2212 E[\u0006V\u03c4 |Gt ] on [t < \u03c4 ].\nThe rest of this section is devoted to the computation of this conditional\nexpectation.

To find the Laplace transform of this density we introduce the\nfollowing martingale as in Chesney, Jeanblanc-Picqu\u00e9 and Yor (1997):\nNt := \b(\u2212 \u03bb\u00b5t\u2227\u03c4\u03b1 ) exp\n(\n\u2212\u03bb\n2\n2\n(t \u2227 \u03c4\u03b1)\n)\n,\nCREDIT RISK AND PARTIAL INFORMATION 1177\nwhere \u00b5t = Mt\/\n\u221a\n2 and \b(z) = \u222b\u221e0 x exp(zx \u2212 x2\/2) dx. Using the optional\nstopping theorem, we obtain\nE\n[\n\b\n(\u2212 \u03bb\u00b5\u03c4\u03b1) exp\n(\n\u2212\u03bb\n2\n2\n(\u03c4\u03b1)\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223Gt\n]\n= \b(\u2212 \u03bb\u00b5t\u2227\u03c4\u03b1 ) exp\n(\n\u2212\u03bb\n2\n2\n(t \u2227 \u03c4\u03b1)\n)\n,\nwhich in turn implies\n1[t>\u03c4\u03b1 ]E\n[\nexp\n(\n\u2212\u03bb\n2\n2\n\u03c4\u03b1\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223Gt\n]\n= 1[t>\u03c4\u03b1]\n\b(\u2212\u03bb\u00b5t) exp((\u2212\u03bb2\/2)t)\n\b(\u03bb\u03b1\/\n\u221a\n2 )\n.\nUsing relatively standard software, one can invert this Laplace transform and\ncompute the expectations given in expressions (4.3)\u2013(4.12).\nFor time 0, using expression (4.12) and rearranging the terms give\nS0 = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b T\n0\nru du\n)(\n1 \u2212\n(\nQ[\u03c4\u03b1 \u2264 T ] \u2212 E\n[\n\u03b1\/\n\u221a\n2\u221a\nT \u2212 g\u00af\u03c4\u03b1\n1[\u03c4\u03b1\u2264T ]\n]))\n.(4.13)\nThis is the price of the risky zero coupon bond at time 0. The interpretation of\nthe last term in this expression is important. Default occurs not at time \u03c4\u03b1 , but at\ntime \u03c4 . The default time \u03c4 is, therefore, less likely than the hitting time \u03c4\u03b1 . The\nprobability Q[\u03c4\u03b1 \u2264 T ] is reduced to account for this difference.\nUnfortunately, the law of \u03c4\u03b1 is only known through its Laplace transform, which\nis very difficult to invert analytically. See Chesney, Jeanblanc-Picqu\u00e9 and Yor\n(1997) in this respect, which gives the following formula:\nE\n[\nexp\n(\n\u2212\u03bb\n2\n2\n\u03c4\u03b1\n)]\n= 1\n\b(\u03bb\u03b1\/\n\u221a\n2 )\n.\nInverting this Laplace transform yields the law for \u03c4\u03b1 , and given the law for \u03c4\u03b1 ,\nexpression (4.13) is easily computed.\n5. Conclusion. This paper provides an alternative method for generating\nreduced form credit risk models from structural models. The difference from\nDuffie and Lando (2001) is that instead of using filtering theory to go from\nthe manager\u2019s information to the market\u2019s as in Duffie and Lando, we use a\nreduction of the manager\u2019s information set. This modification is both conceptually\nand mathematically a different approach to the topic. Indeed, the perspective\nfrom filtering theory is that the market\u2019s information set is the same as the\nmanager\u2019s, but with additional noise included. The perspective from reducing\nthe manager\u2019s information set is that the market\u2019s information set is the same\nas the manager\u2019s, but the market just knows less of it. It would be interesting\nto investigate more complex structural models than those used herein and more\ncomplex information reductions.\n1178 \u00c7ETIN, JARROW, PROTTER AND YILDIRIM\nAcknowledgment.
