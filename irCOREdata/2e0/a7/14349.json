At present, the\ndirection of the pendulum is towards active learning, exploratory learning and so forth, and the\nwobbles I detect from time to time probably do not indicate an imminent swing in the opposite\ndirection among educationists, since these wobbles are mostly caused by politicians.\nRunning parallel with this move towards learning centred on partnership, interactivity and\ndiscovery are the developments in learning technology with which ALT is so deeply\nconcerned. But user-expectations are still largely ahead of what the technology can actually\ndeliver. And herein lies the heart of the problem of the relationship between changing\neducation and changing technology. Current educational thinking makes ever-increasing\ndemands on a technology which, as often as not, is unequal to the task. Hence the lack of full-\nscreen, full-motion, fully interactive video in multimedia CAL software. Hence the inability of\nmost examples of such software to distinguish between a serious student error and little more\nthan a slip of the finger on the keyboard, let alone to see subtle implications in errors,\nimplications which human teachers might easily sense. Hence the difficulties encountered in a\nnumber of Internet-related learning schemes: the supposed information superhighway can in\nreality be more like an information B road.\nSo while I was hardly astonished that the majority of the papers given at the conference dealt\nin one way or another with changes in technology and\/or reflected present trends in\neducational thinking, I was a little surprised that so few of them directly addressed what for me\n5\nGabriel Jacobs Editorial\nwas the central implication of the conference's theme: the complex and potentially uneasy\nrelationship between the two kinds of change.\nMany papers described pieces of high-risk software - high-risk because it teeters on the edge\nof the capabilities of the technology available to most people, and because its effectiveness is\nas yet unproven. The history of information-delivery technology shows that as soon as a new\nform of it appears (chalk and slate, the printing press, tape recorders, overhead projectors,\nvideo tapes, computer-controlled presentations, data communications . . . ) , teachers try to take\nadvantage of its educational possibilities, with varying degrees of success. There is of course\nnothing intrinsically wrong in the desire to tread new ground; after all, if Columbus had waited\nuntil it was perfectly safe to travel by sea, he would not have found America. On the other\nhand, we are dealing here not with, say, medical research where doctors try out risky\ntechniques on patients who would otherwise die because there is no alternative treatment, but\nrather with an area offering a whole range of well-tried methods.\nChanging education is not always a consequence of changing technology, nor vice-versa. The\nlinks between the two, inextricable though they are, are far from straightforward, and we who\nconsider ourselves at the forefront of educational thinking should constantly be on our guard\nagainst the dangerous view that they must necessarily move forward hand in hand. Who dares\nwins may be the motto of the SAS, but we are not in their business.\nGabriel Jacobs\n6\n"}
