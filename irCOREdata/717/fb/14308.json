The globalization of higher education should stress the importance of\nthe tools for developing countries that provide self-produced appropriate higher education for\nthemselves, and remove cynical profiteering\nAn introduction - why globalize?\nThere has been an increase in the level of commerce that transcends national boundaries.\nBusinesses no longer rely on local markets as acceptable, safe areas to do business. The\nemphasis is on globalization. Failing to globalize will result in the decline of a commercial\nactivity, and a 1990 survey among businesses found that 40 per cent of them considered the\nexpansion of the global market required increased production capacity and speed\n(Peppard, 1993).\nGlobalization has been heralded by the development of free trade associations. All of these\ndevelopments have been founded on the basis of international trade, with some\nassociations going further in their evolution than others. The growth in genuine global\ntrade has undoubtedly been influenced by the impact of information technologies. The\nincrease in cross-border financial transactions has been eased through newly introduced\nfinancial systems. New technology means that mass produced goods can be customized to\nsuit a particular market (Wheelwright and Clark, 1992), evident in industries as diverse as\ncar and software development.\n6\nALT-] Volume 6 Number I\nEducation has shown parallels. British education has always attracted an overseas\naudience. Anecdotal evidence shows that many overseas students come from former British\ncolonies, as well as the Gulf States and China.\nWhy this interest in British education? Is the UK system of higher education among the\nbest in the world? Former colonial states have systems of education (along with civil\nservices) based on a UK model, allowing for easier integration of learning, and an\navailable pathway. UK red-brick universities have been noted for engineering and research\nreputation, vital skills in a developing country.\nCost, distance, and time away from home have been barriers to entry for all but a few\nprivileged individuals. The vast majority of overseas students who study in the UK do so\nbecause they can afford it through personal wealth, or through rare financial aid. Despite\nhigh numbers of overseas students studying in UK universities, the percentage of students\nfrom each country who have the opportunity to study is small. It seems important to make\nlearning available to more students in particular overseas countries. Historically, this has\nbeen difficult and costly. Approaches to home-country learning have included visiting\nlecturers and franchised courses.\nThe first choice relies on availability (and willingness) of academics for overseas duties.\nThere are issues relating to travel, cost and time. An academic overseas is not available as\nan academic at home, causing concern at the home institution. Franchisement poses\ndifferent problems, discussed later.\nThe need to encourage learning overseas still exists. The quality of learning experience that\nUK academia provides could be extremely high. The existing need for skills in engineering\nand sciences can only be a benefit for emerging economies if such a need is fulfilled.\nThere are other factors that spur UK institutions into developing courses in emerging\neconomies. UNESCO (1995) reports that higher education should consider pro-activity in\nan international environment. Gordon (1995) notes that traditional 'cottage industry'\nlecturing academics are disappearing, replaced by more efficient and effective ways of\ndissemination. As American-led fast-food outlets have globalized eating habits and\nconsumption, so the development of a postmodern McUniversity emerges to lead learning\nconsumption (Ritzer 1996). Here is the development of 'education as a product' (Plater,\n1995) rather than a difficult-to-define something else. A product can ultimately be sold!\nTechnology for mass education\nThere are issues that determine the nature of global education relating to the evolution of\nthe university environment in the next century:\n\u2022 university education as a mass production system;\n\u2022 information technology for distance learning;\n\u2022 the 'consuming' of education.\nCommunications and network technologies already impact on the development of mass\nglobal education. There are a number of courses that are offered via the Internet, and the\nUS experience of delivering undergraduate courses is highly developed (Brittingham and\nDavid Bird and Brian Nicholson A critique of the drive towards the globalization of higher education\nCook, 1995). The consumerist outlook of students means that the delivery of learning has\nbecome akin to other daily experiences, such as surfing on the Internet, channel-hopping\non television, or eating fast food (Ritzer, 1996). Plater (1995) recognizes that Western\nstudents are becoming consumers who see education as a product.\nTo add to the increasing 'consumption' of education, technologies such as broadcast\nmedia, mixed-media CD-ROM, cable television, and the World Wide Web have allowed the\nbeginnings of entertainment-based education. Academics have partnered with\ncommunication businesses such as CNN and MTV to produce materials for global\ndistribution.\nPlater (1995) suggests that:\nTechnology will change forever the dominant model of synchronous, time-linked\ninteraction that has made teaching and learning complementary and interdependent.\nLearning will no longer depend on a faculty member's teaching.\nThis suggests that the movement of knowledge becomes a one-way affair. Interaction with\nacademics becomes almost zero. Students become expected to produce work on their own.\nThere is a level of impersonality associated with this mode of education: the reward is\nlower costs.\nThe critique\nThe purpose of this critique is to develop an anti-narrative of the story. The reader needs\nto develop a sensible judgement about the validity or not of the pregnant concept of global\ndistance learning. The argument focuses around the role of education in a global network,\ntacit knowledge and discussions about cultural imperialism. It is necessarily provocative.\nThe intention is to raise issues around whether the globalization of education via\ntechnology-based distance learning is at best a naive technological fix and at worst an\nexample of an extreme form of capitalism riding on a wave of technological utopianism.\nIt can be argued that educational institutions are capturing the 'wave' of technological\noptimism in order to exploit an opportunity, and that this leads to an impoverished\neducation. Iacono and Kling (1996) remark that, increasingly, computer technologies are\nlinked to all socially valuable behaviour, and are singled out as the panacea of all social\nproblems. Technology is seen as enabling an efficient means by which 'education' can be\ndelivered anywhere in the world, requiring the commodification of education via\", for\ninstance, a technological fix of distance learning via the Internet. It is questionable whether\nthis 'product' can represent education rather than simple training. Many aspects of\nknowledge are regarded as tacit (Polyani, 1973; Schon, 1983). It is well known that tacit\nskills can be transferred only through a process of socialization (master to apprentice). In a\ntechnology-based distance learning environment, when time and space separate the\nlearners, it is questionable where and when this process of socialization will happen to\nenable the learners to draw on this source of tacit knowledge. This approach to education\nimplies a view of the learner as a 'black box', limiting education to the exchange of\nconcrete explicit symbols, reducing the experience to vocational training.\nSir Ron Dealing (1997) makes the point that franchising agreements between British\nuniversities and those in other countries have been seen to fail. Courses that are franchised\n8\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nout to educational establishments overseas suffer from poorer-quality levels of teaching\ndue to academics that are not as able as those in the home country. Levels of quality\nassurance may not be as stringent due to the hands-off nature of franchise management.\nStudents taken on by the franchise might not be as able as those taken on by the UK\nUniversity, and this can have adverse effects on issues such as the reputation of qualifica-\ntion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the educational experience of students on overseas\nfranchised courses does not match that of overseas students who come to study in the UK.\nThere are few guarantees that similar debacles will not occur with the delivery of education\nto developing countries via technology. Similarly there are no guarantees in a free market\nthat quality products will emerge and customers will appreciate that what they are buying\nis not 'education' from a British university. In the absence of standards, there is complete\nreliance on the ethics of the education-providers in delivering an appropriate quality\n'product* for their developing country-based 'customers'. Examples of profiteering exist,\nwith disturbing evidence that foreign universities in India prefer to team up with\nprofessional institutes that are not part of the higher-education system. These attract rich\nstudents of less merit, and degrees are often unrecognized (Powar, 1997).\nEducation as a cultural force\nWhat about the problematic notion of cross-cultural education via technology-based distance\nlearning? Education is viewed by many as reinforcing the cultural underpinnings of a nation\nstate. Dearing (1997) points out that education is a 'guardian or transmitter of culture'. The\nschool education system in particular is seen both as the structural foundation for a culture,\nand as providing an awareness of a large proportion of the 'social glue' of society.\nNations attribute great relevance to education policy. Witness the attention given to the\nNational Curriculum in the UK and debates over assessment and discipline. Higher\neducation has a somewhat different tradition, but historically reflects the power relations\nand level of individuality of a culture.\nNations in the developing world fear the increase of cultural, economic and political\nimperialism by powerful developed nations, and the loss of language and traditional ways\nof life. The Macbride report on the New World Information and Communication Order\n(NWICO) in 1980 sought to bring about a more equitable system of information flows\nbetween developed and developing nations. The ability of foreign broadcasters to beam\npoor-quality TV and satellite into countries regardless of the wishes of a country is a\nwarning of the implications of unregulated education via the Internet. This can only offer\nvariable quality in tandem with a threat to cultural integrity, which could be described as\nelectronic cultural imperialism (Martin 1995).\nProblems of technology-based distance learning across cultures\nThe final argument draws on the work of Hofstede (1992) who has been concerned with\nunderstanding cultural differences between nations. This research has been used by a large\nnumber of studies into cross-cultural dimensions of organizations (Kedia and Bhagat,\n1988; Erez and Earley, 1993), and has been shown to be useful for thinking about national\ncultural issues across disciplines. These findings should provoke discussion concerning the\nproblematic nature of cross-cultural education using technology-based distance learning.\nDavid Bird and Brian Nicholson A critique of the drive towards the globalization of higher education\nThe Hofstede framework includes the following dimensions of national culture:\n\u2022 Power distance has to do with the extent to which people expect their superiors to think\nfor them, the inequality of power between higher- and lower-level persons, and the\ndegree to which that inequality is accepted.\n\u2022 Uncertainty avoidance has to do with the extent to which the members of a culture feel\nthreatened by uncertain or unknown situations, and the extent to which future\npossibilities are defended against or accepted.\n\u2022 Individualism has to do with the relative importance of individual goals compared with\ngroup goals and the degree of interdependency among members of a society\n\u2022 Masculinity has to do with the extent to which a society values achievement of results,\nheroism, assertiveness and material success. In a masculine society, sympathy is with\nthe winner and fighters; feminine cultures indicate more sympathy with the meek and\nunderdog. Masculine societies are said to 'live to work', feminine societies 'work to\nlive'.\nEach dimension is typified by particular characteristics and each country is categorized on\nthe extent to which the population exhibits these characteristics on a sliding scale from\nhigh to low. This allows direct comparisons and tentative indications of the dominant\nnational characteristics of a given group reflecting what Hofstede refers to as 'mental\nprogramming'.\nConsider Hofstede's remarks on education within 'power distance' and 'individualism':\nPower Distance. In a large power-distance situation in countries such as Malaysia or India,\nthe educational system is highly personalized especially at university. What is transferred is\nnot impersonal truth but the personal wisdom of the teacher. The power of inspiration is\nkey; the teacher is known as a 'guru' in India and Indonesia, a term derived from Sanskrit\nfor 'weighty' or 'honourable'. This term defines the relationship, seen as spiritual and\npersonal with the quality of learning wholly dependent on the teacher. This contrasts with\nsmall power distance cultures such as the USA or Britain where the educational process is\nstudent-centred, with a premium on student initiative and with students finding their own\nintellectual paths. The emphasis is on personal initiative, and it is one which is common in\nthe design assumptions of technology-based distance learning, as the teacher and learner\nare separated by time and space. Designs rely on self-motivation and a culturally developed\nsense of independence, absent in a large power distance country.\nIndividualism. Consider Hofstede's comments on individualism and collectivism. Collect-\nivist countries include countries such as Malaysia, Taiwan and Korea; individualist\ncountries include Britain, the USA and Canada. A typical complaint from teachers of\nstudents from collectivist countries is that they do not speak up in class and will also\nhesitate to speak up in larger groups, it being seen as inappropriate to speak up without the\nsanction of the group. This is seen as problematic particularly if the technology-based\ndistance learning attempts to incorporate some innovation such as groupware to overcome\nthe problems of participation. There is a danger that students will again not contribute in\nways expected by the educator. Hofstede points out crucial differences with regard to the\npurpose of education between individualist and collectivist societies:\n10\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nIn the former it aims at preparing the individual for a place in a society of other\nindividuals. This means learning to cope with new unknown unforeseen situations.\nThere is basically a positive attitude to what is new. The purpose of learning is less to\nknow how to do as to know how to learn. In the collectivist society there is a stress on\nadaptation to skills and virtues necessary to be an acceptable group member. Learning\nis seen as a one-time process to learn how to do things in order to participate in society.\nNational philosophy and character of learning are viewed as different between cultures.\nInterestingly, those countries that are high on both of the dimensions mentioned include\nTaiwan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore, supposedly ripe markets for distance education.\nSmith (1993) found that there were real problems that came to light when distance-learning\ntechnologies were used in India. Issues he identified included:\n\u2022 rigidity in the learning model (i.e. the model for learning was not flexible enough for the\nvariety and culture of learners);\n\u2022 poor accessibility;\n\u2022 a failure to be accepted as rigorous in the academic world.\nConclusions and implications for the development of cross-cultural\ndistance learning\nWe have addressed a number of issues regarding the globalization of higher education, and\nhave considered the motivation for global higher education, problematic issues of quality,\nthe role of education, tacit knowledge and arguments on cross-cultural issues.\nThere is the need for standards of quality for technology-assisted distance education,\nespecially when delivered to other countries, and for course designers to be sensitive to\ndiffering learning styles across cultures, and to consider tailoring materials via\ncollaborative development and providing local support for the learning process.\nFrom a pessimistic perspective it could be argued that the globalization of education is\nbeing carried on a wave of techno-optimism coupled with a scramble to exploit new\nmarkets. From a pragmatic perspective this uncritical view of the potential of global higher\neducation poses significant threats to the future integrity and reputation of Western\ntechnology-assisted distance learning.\nReferences\nBrittingham, B. and Cook, C.M.
