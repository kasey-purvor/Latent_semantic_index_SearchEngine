COTTAGE \nINDUSTRY, SOCIAL CHANGE, AND \nINDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION \nI \nSmall-scale, traditional local handicrafts had always existed in rural areas, but in \nthe period from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century a new economic development \noccurred in many regions to which considerable attent.ioin is now being paid. TIhere \nwas an expansion of rural industry without major changes in the techniques or scale \nof production. This developmental phase has recently been termed 'proto- \nindustrial' - a form of 'Industrialization before industrialization' which it is \nclaimed holds the key to the question of why the industrial revolution took place.1 \nDrawing on the work of'Braun and others, the theory of proto-industrialization was \noriginated by Mendels in his work on Flanders2 and has been further developed \nparticularly by Medick, Kriedte and Schlumbohm of the Max-Planck Institut fhr \nGeschichte in Gottingen as a way of explaining the transition both from feudalism \nto capitalism, and from a traditional society of peasant agriculture to the modern \nindustrial world. As a description of the nature of expanding rural industry during \nthis period, and as an explanation of industrialization, the theory put forward in \nIndustrialization before ind2ustrialization is very wide-ranging over time and space, and \nhas invited much discussion. We intend here to consider and appraise this concept \nand the arguments made for its importance. \nProto-industry occurred in the countryside among peasant farmers and serni- \nproletarianized workers in need of an incomc supplement. It was however controlled \nby urban capital, which integrated it into a new set of regional, supra-regional and \ninternational markets.3 I'he goods produced were mainly textiles with their mass \nmarket potential, but industrial activities included gloving, straw-plaiting, glass- \nmaking, leather and metal working. Previously, petty producers had commonly \nowned the means of production, and sold their products locally or to a middleman, \nbut proto-industry made them much mor-e dependent o01 capital and upoIl \nentrepreneurial commission. Proponents of proto-industrial theory stress that in \nI P. Kriedtc, H. Mcdick and j. Schlumbohm, Industrialization before industrialization (Cam- \nbridge, I98I). Translated by B. Schempp, first published as Ihdustrialisierung vor der Industrial- \ni.sieruyng (Gdttingen, 1977). (Henceforth KMS). \n2 F. F. Mendels, 'Proto-industrialization: the first phase of the induistrializatioin process', \n.7nl qf Economic History, xxxii (1972). The work of Mendels and of Kriedtc, Mccdick and \nSchlumbohm cannot be seen as part of the same intellectual tradition. The former is influenced \nby modernization theory, and the latter espouisC various forms of Marxism. The criticisms of \nthis article are directed at aspects of proto-industrial theory held by all its exponent.s. \n3 KMS, pp. 2-- 3. \n473 \n474 HISTORICAL JOURNAL \nEngland in particular there was a 'reorganization of rural relations of production \naccording to the laws of the market' from the sixteenth century onwards.4 \nFurthermore, and drawing on the classical economic theory that markets overseas \nincorporated productive resources more effectively than did local markets, it is \nargued that 'foreign trade was not only the \" handmaiden \" of proto-industrialization, \nbut, indeed, its \" engine of growth\" '.5 Such a wider market acted as a powerful agent \nof social and demographic change, having far-reaching effects on an economically \ntraditional form of production, still based on conservative inclinations among rural \nproducers who wished to maintain intact their family economies. \nProto-industry is held to be specifically but not completely capitalist, an \nadaptation of capital to existing conditions of labour availability. Untrammelled by \nurban guild and company restrictions, rural workers were particularly attractive to \nentrepreneurs since they often had a subsistence base in agriculture and could thus \nforgo part of their wages, which were extracted as surplus by the capitalist.6 \nThroughought Europe, the theory argues, merchant capital exploited an impover- \nished 'peasantry' who were responding to subsistence needs in the way predicted \nby Chayanov for Russia: when labour input of land had increased to the point where \nmarginal returns to additional inputs were negligible the family would turn to \nnon-agricultural work.' The peasant family was a self-exploitative entity searching \nfor day-to-day subsistence without any calculation of the cost of its labour.8 The \n'total labour force' of the family was applied in an attempt to maximize use values \nrather than exchange values, to augment gross product rather than net profit.9 \nThe theory of proto-industrialization has it that maximum total labour income \nwas achieved by the joint working capacity of husband and wife plus a large number \nof economically productive children.'0 Proto-industrial workers are believed to have \nhad an earlier age at first marriage than their traditional agricultural counterparts, \na higher proportion ever married and consequently higher fertility and population \ngrowth rates.\" The reason for this is thought to be that 'generative reproduction \namong the landless and land-poor industrial producers was no longer tied to the \n\"social reproduction\" of a relatively inflexible rural property structure'.'2 'The \nfamily engaged in domestic industry reproduced itself in such numbers in order to \nsubsist through its labour, and not primarily to consume \"surpluses\", still less to \naccumulate them. \"13 Proletarianization of labour freed more people ' from traditional \ncontrols which had previously been effective measures of maintaining an optimum \npopulation size'.'4 ' Children necessarily counted as labour power... they were also \n\" living capital\" that served to support the parents during their old age. \"\" Because \nof this it was necessary to have children early and frequently, and to retain them \n4 KMS, p. 21. 5 KMS, P- 34- \n6 KMS, p. 23- 7 KMS, pp. i6, 26. \n8 P.

T hus in \nproto-industrial areas rates of population growth are presumed to have been faster \nthan in strictly agricultural regions, populatiorn density greater and household size \nlarger.', Proto-industry broke a previous demographic homeostasis: 'population and \ndomestic industry grew jointly, reinforcing each other's extension'.Y7 These \ndemographic changes were accelerated as 'merchant capital, by drawiilg an \nessentially pre-capitalist social formation -- namely peasant society -- into its sphere, \npromoted the process of accumulation and became the pacemaker of the general \nacceptance of the market principle '.18 The social consequences of this were \nconsiderable, and apparently included far-reaching changes in familial relations and \nthe disappearance of 'traditional' sexual divisions of labour.'9 \nWhile unable fully to discuss all the features of proto-industrial theory, we shall \nconsider some of the problems in this explanation of social and economic change \nin the early modern world. Kriedte has written that: \nThe introduction of a new terin to characterize a specific stage in socio-economic (developmenelt \nis justified only if it can be operationalized. It must be possible to assign to it empirically \nverifiable indicators.20 \nHis own criterion of proto-industry stressed that the level of industrial income \nshould exceed that from agricuilture, and that production must be mainly for non-local \nmarkets.2' Both Mendels aild Kriedte have stressed that the existenec of (often \nsubstantial) proportions of non-agricultural workers involved in rural domestic \nindustry (found in parts of Europe from the twelfth century if not earlier) is not by \nitself a sufficient indicator.22 And the latest of a range of definlitions from Mendels \nhas emphasized that the market should be located outside the region of production; \nthat production should bc by precariously self-subsistent peasan-ts, although the \nprocess was organized from, and the product sometimes finished in, towns; and that \nthere should be a 'symbiosis of rural industry with the regional development of \ncommercial agricuilture'.23 These definitions provide a reasonably concrete starting \npoint. However, it must be said straight away that it is difficult to estimate either \nearnings or production, as criticisms of J. U. iNef's theory of an 'industrial revolu- \ntion' in the sixteenth century have shown.24 It is harder still to determine the \nprop)ortion of' Iproduction for supra-regional and international markets '.25 At what \nstage for examp)le did the market transcend purely local horizons and thus promote \nproto-industrial development? Population patterns, at least, can usually be qjuanti \nfied; but without necessary evidence on many 'hard' economic aspects, advocates of \nthe theory have often been constrained to a range of measures indicative simply of \n'the destabilization of the traditional social structure .'26 \na KMS, pl. 82. \n17 S.

According to Medick et al. 'protoindustrialization could establish itself \nonly where the ties of the feudal systemn hadl either loosened or were in the process \nof full disintegration'.27 In parts of central Russia the shift after about I76o from \nlabour services to payment iri caslh or kind was associated with a sharp rise in \nparticip)ationl in cottage industry.28 However, this was not always the case, arid \nKriedte points to the example of the feudal lords (Gutssherren) oIn the Silesian border, \nwhere linen production was drawn into the system of feudal obligations.29 Bohemian \nindustrial commodity production was fitted into the structure of feudal exp)loitation \nand was used to preserve feudal relations.3z) Side by side with feudal landlords we \ncan nevertheless detect successful serf-capitalists or kulak-type peasant middlemen.3' \nFurther, the serf system favoured cottage industry over concentrated manufactures, \nwith the result that factories did not rep)lace domestic labour until the twentieth \ncentury.32 In -arts of eighteenth and nineteenth-century Russia rural domestic \nproduction c.ompeted successfully with large, concentrated manufactories.3 Finally \nthere was little regional specialization of agriculture anid inidustry since industrial \ncommodity production was located in the same household as agriculture.34 \nNor do the cdemographic predictiolns of proto-industrial theory work outside \nnorthwestern Europe, since before the nineteenlth cerntury in eastern and southern \nEurope age at first marriage for women was usually already low --- typ)ically I 7---2 \ncomp)ared to 23---27 in northwestern Europe --- proportions never married were low, \nmigration by inidividuals was restricted and households were large.35 Intensification \nof industrial commodity production in eighteenth-aiid nineteenth-century Japan \nand Russia was not associated with a fall in the age of marriage or greater population \ndensity.36 Mean household size was actually smaller in industrial regiorns of Russia \ncompared to agricultural ones.37 Land was made available by the commnunity in \nRussia, so that there was no constraint creatcd by the need to wait for inheritance, \nfrom whichi young couples could be freed by industrial employmnent opportunities.38 \nIn Russia as in Japan family and community control over individuals remained \nstrong, and the division of labour betweerl (predominantly female) industrial \nproduction and (largely male) agricultural proCductiorl remained a prominent \n27 KMS, I. 6. \n28 R.

The first crucial asp)ect of the theory concerns the agrarian I)reconditions \nof I)roto-industry, which is seen emerging in the high middle ages as a result of the \ndeveloping division of labour, social I)olarization, intensified market transactions, \nthe development of towns and I)oI)ulation increase.41 The work of Joan Thirsk in \nI)articular stressed the I)astoral context of cottage industry, arguing that I)asture and \nup)land areas were unable to I)rovide as full emp)loyment as mixed or cereal-producing \nregions, and were thus p)articularly recel)tive to cottage industrial by-employments.42 \nProtagonists of I)roto-industrial theory have adopted this argument, along with the \nassociated stress on the need for by-employments where partible inheritance customs \nhad led to subdivision of I)easant holdings and allowed I)opulation to grow to a level \nof unstable subsistence.43 For Mendels 'the most significant aspect of I)roto- \nindustrialization concerns the I)articil)ation of peasant I)o)ulations in handicraft \nproduction for the market'.\" Kriedte too argues that 'the subsistence farm must \nbe considered as the agrarian basis of I)roto-industrialization', and finds 'the rural \nindustries of Europe concentrated in barren mountain regions'.45 The theory is \npredicated on the assumption of subdivided peasant holdings in pastoral and infertile \nupland regions: a premise which is important both for subsequent demographic and \nsocial structural predictions and for attempts to connect I)roto-industrial growth with \nthe development of commercial agriculture. \nNow the problem that arises here is that much rural domestic industry, including \nthat of a proto-industrial nature, could be located in very different environments, \nmany of them not p)astoral and up)land. In England alone one thinks of the East \n9 0.

Even the Suffolk woollen industry was not located in wood-pasture areas, \nand only half of thc Suffolk villages active in thc industry lay in a pastoral region. \nThc rest were in a sheep--corn district. All such industries were proto-industrial in \nthat they produced for non-local markets. In Scotland thc pressure of population \non scarce economic resources produced a greater involvement in linen-yarr \nproduction in the Highlands during thc eighteenth century, but therce was also a \nsubstantial amount of spinning and manufacture in rural areas and small towns such \nas Kilmarnock, set in thc rich arable land of thc Western Lowlands.46 SuCh contrary \nexamples are common too on thc continent, and raise obvious doubts about thc exact \nagrarian preconditions of proto-industrialization. Kriedte, Medick and Schlumbohmn \nseem to recognize thc many exceptions, but these do much to vitiate thc thcory at \nan early stage. \nTheir discussion of this (as of many other) issues is indeed replete withl qualifi- \ncatory phrases,47 and there are frequently more exceptions than they admit. At thc \nsame time, many of thc different agrarian preconditions and contexts they list arc \nthcoretically quite incompatible. They include conditions of seasonal (winter) \nunemployment associated with arable and commercial farming; generalized struc- \ntural unemployment; the predominance of subsistence and strictly peasant farms; \n'barren mountain regions'; commercial stock-raising districts; situations where \nthere had been a subdivision of holdings; places where money rents were rising; \npoor-soiled and less productive pastoral districts; population growth; areas near \ntowns with labour shortages, sometimes with guild and company controls to be \nescaped; areas with chcap raw materials, or with low taxes and\/or prices; districts \nfaced with different forms of agricultural depression; rising rural real wages or \nwages above subsistence requirements; 'a labour system that was still essentially \nfeudal... in which \"property rights\" were not fully assured' ;48 rural areas proxi- \nmate to ports; districts with marketing and transport facilities; a 'more open and \nflexible social order' than obtained where 'tthe collective controls of thc village were \nstill unbroken', and so on.49 The thcory aims to delineate and typify in a certain \nform the nature of expanding rural industry, but in this regard almost every con- \nceivable European agrarian context is encompassed. As Kriedte eventually admits: \n'Despite what was said earlier, those forms [agrarian preconditions] could vary \ngreatly'.50 Thc authors acknowledge regional diversity, but from thc start force it \ninto a very limiting thcoretical framework. \nNevertheless, thc consistent emphasis in proto-industrial thcory is thc need for \nindustrial commodity production among peasant smallholders whose relatively \nunproductive upland holdings have become fragmented, and where demographic \npressure on limited resources was acute. Proto-industry is said to be thc 'child of \npoverty'; and because of their foothold on thc land and non-capitalist mentality \n46 R. A.

Despite demand for their products, \nearnings apparently remained desparately low, especially in thc final stages when \nproto-industry was glutted by its own demographic repercussions, and threatened \nby thc factory system to which its course of development apparently led it. \nHowever, we should strcss that proto-industry often emerged during periods of \nrising real wages, and indeed frequeritly enhanced thc wages of industrial commodity \nproducers particularly before thc late eighteenth century. For example, it allowed \na higher standard of living in parts of Belgium,5\" or among thc hand and framework \nknitters in Leicestershire;52 or in the metal and weapons trade around Li~ge;53 or \nfor thc English handloom weavers until late in thc eighteenth century.54 In pillow \nlace and straw plait too, earnings (especially for women) could be considerably \nenhanced,55 and this was also true for some glove-making areas. Thc presenice of \nrural domestic industry could also maintain familial income during periods wlhen \nagricultural real wages were commonly falling, as for example in thc hosiery districts \nof thc southern Midlands of England after about I 770.56 Real wages in cereal- \nproducing areas of southern England often fell sharply in areas lacking cottage \nindustry.57 All this suggests that proto-industrial areas were not necessarily fearful \npoverty traps; and that thc emphasis given to proto-industry as a major explanation \nof continued pauperism is overdrawn and simplistic in ignoring many other factors.58 \nThc arguments of Medick et al. that proto-industry developed from and perpetuated \na specific context of agrarian poverty through the relationship of population to the \nneeds of capitalist production singularly fail to take cognizance of the actual \nexperience of proto-industrial regions. \nIII \nLet us turn to the demographic components of thc thcory.

Thc same phenomenon can be recognized in \nthc eighteenth century for all regions of continental Europe wsherc cottage industry \nor proto-industry generally played dominant roles as sources of livelihood. '61 Indeed \nit did. In thc canton of Zurich in i634 population density was 46 per square \nkilometre in farming regions and 53 in upland industrial commodity production \nareas; by I 792 thc density in proto-industrial parts had risen faster than agricultural: \nto Io08 compared to 73.62 Thc comparatively less fertile mountain areas of Bohemia \nhad population densitics 30 per cent higher than thc national average, due to rural \ndomestic industry.63 By thc late eighteenth century proto-industrial areas of Ireland \nhad comparatively dense populations,64 while mono-industrial (textile) regions of \nGermany such as Minden and Ravensburg had faster rates of population increase \nthan thc more diverse industrial area of Mark.65 A similar pattern can be found in \nparts of England, Scotland, Holland and Flanders.66 Yet these densities were not \nunique to proto-industrial areas. Thc three eastern provinces of Prussia with thc \nhighcst crude birth rates in the late eighteenth century had almost no industry, but \nthere had been a 'r6am6nagement de l'conomic domaniale'.67 Parts of wiholly \nagricultural central Finland saw a doubling of population between I 72O and I 770.68 \nThc count of Tecklenburg, a large-scale cloth producer, had population densities \non his estates very similar to neighbouring areas wihich were wiholly agrarian.69 In \nEngland thc agrarian south moved from having among the lowest birth rates of any \nEnglish region in thc early eighteenth century to having thc second highcst in thc \nearly nincteenth century. Thc region was certainly not one of expanding cottage \nindustry.70 In other words proto-industry does account for population increase and \ndensity in some areas, but cannot be used as a general explanation of thc \neighteenth-century population rise. Population growtth and high densities may occuI \nfor reasons wihich have little to do with industrial commodity production. \nOf course it is possible that thc mechanisms behind demographic change may have \nbeen different in areas of rural domestic industry.

Proto-industrial workers therefore married earlier than their \nagricultural counterparts, and since more of the vwoman's childbearing years were \nutilized population would rise.7' Significant differences can certainly be detected in \nthc demographically crucial age at first marriage for women between some cottage \nindustrial and agricultural populations. At Comines in north-east France for thc \nyears I 739-89 thc mean age at first marriage for brides involved in textile production \nwas 25-3 years, wihile for peasant brides it was 28.72 Four agricultural villages in \nFrench Flanders during thc period I690-- I799 had female marriage ages ranging \nfrom 27 6 to fully 30, but in two proto-industrial villages in this region ages were \n22-4 and 23 7.73 \nHowever, thc picture is not as simple as it may appear. In a group of villages in \nthc Thimerais, situated between Chartres and Dreux, the rate of increase in age at \nfirst marriage for women marrying laboureurs (big farmers) over thc eighteenth \ncentury was much less than forjournaliers - mainly weavers and labourers.74 During \nthc I 720s laboureur women were marrying on average at 23- I years, but by I 760--89 \nthis had risen to 25-2. For journaliers thc comparable increase was 2I-9 to 26 3. At \nthc same time, though not dealing with specifically proto-industrial communities, \nthc work of John Knodel on eighteenth- and nincteenth-century German villages \ncasts serious doubt on thc connexion between proletarianization and population \nincrease through thc mechanisms of nuptiality and fertility. He finds that farmers' \nwives were almost invariably younger wihen they first married than were thc wives \ncither of artisans or of cottagers and unskilled labourers.75 These differences in thc \ndemographically crucial female age at marriage are consistent over time and across \nall villages studied. Lastly, by comparing two villages in the Basse Meuse region \nof Belgium wihich mixed agriculture with mining and metal working, with one in \nthc Pays de Herve wsherc agricultural changes during thc eighteenth century \nincreased involvement in spinning and weaving woollen cloth, G(uttman and \nLeboutte found that thc predictions were cither seriously attenuated or not \nfulfilled.76 There was no significant fall in thc female age at first marriage in thc \nproto-industrializing village of Thimister until thc fertility transition in thc late \nnincteenth century.

The demographic c hanges \ndiscussed by Mendels, Levine and others are not exclusively, nor perhaps generally, \nassociated with proto-industrialization. \nThc need for a wider comparative context is illustrated in thc demiographic work \nof Levine.77 Mendels rather boldly asscrts that 'thc demographic aspects of the \nhypotheses were fully tested out by David Levine on some English parishes'.78 Yet \nLevine's work is marred by thc narrowness of his key comparison of demographic \npatterns in thc proto-industrial village of Shepshed in Leicestershire with those of \nthc nearby agricultural parish of Bottesford. He argued that thc opportunity of \nnon-agricultural employment resulted in thc estrangement of growing numbers in \nShepshed from traditional Malthusian preventive checks, removing thc disincentive \nto early marriage.79 Since increased fertility, largely caused by a fall in marriage \nage, was thc main engine of population growtth in England between I 7oo and i850, \nhis demonstration that in Shepshed female age at first marriage fell by more than \nfive years between thc seventeenth century and the second quarter of thc nincteenth \ncompared to only one or two years at Bottesford seems to point to thc causes of \npopulation growtth before and during thc industrial revolution.80 However, if we \ncompare thc experience of Shepshed women and those from Gedling, anotherpossibly \nproto-inidustrial communiity which had some framework knitting, with thc mean age \nat first marriage for eleven English parishes wsherc family reconstitution studies have \nbeen completed, we find that it was much less distinctive than Levine believed (see \nTable i). These eleven parishcs cover a wide range of economic types, but \nsignificantly they had comparatively little involvement in proto-industry. \nTable i .

Thc rate of fall in age at marriage is \nactually less between thc late seventeenth and late eighteenth century at Shepshed \nand G(edling than in thc eleven 'traclitional' communities. \nAt thc same time thc period of thc greatest proletarianization during thc early \nnincteenth century in England as a wlhole did not see a quickening ofr nuptiality, \nbut rather a fall in fertility. This fertility decline after i8i5 was not thc result of a \nfundamentally different response to economic trends among thc increasing numbers \nof proto-industrial workers in thc population. Rather it was to be expected from thc \nexperience of earlier generations wihen real wages fell.82 Thc relationship between \nnuptiality and fertility and variationis in real wages is important, and in England \nit has been argued that they were closely connected. In thc long term wshen real \nwages rose so too did nuptiality, albeit with a lag of thirty or forty years, thc level \nfalling again with a similar lag wlhen real wages were stagnant or dropping.83 \nHowever, for Medick et al. the relation of fertility to the standard of living is seen \nvery differently. For them it was low wages which encouraged early marriage, since \nindustrial producers were fighting for subsistence and needed to increase production \nby using more family members. Marriage remained early and wages low in this \nvicious circle. Similarly, Mendels argued that wihen grain prices fell and linen prices \nrose in Flanders population also rose, and that it did not decline when real wages \nfell.84 Thc problem here in part is to explore and distinguish between short- and \nlong-term relationships.85 Proto-industrial thcory does not do this. Its advocates see \nthe demographic effects of falling real wages or adverse internal terms of trade as \nan unprecedented break from previous relationships between population and \nresources. This seems dubious in England, wsherc it is possible that thc immiscration \nwhich occurred after about I770 'is wihat might be expected in view of previous \npre-industrial national experience, and did not represent a new or unlooked for turn \nof vents .86 \nThere are also problems with Levine's discussion of illegitimacy, taken over by \nproto-industrial thcory. Following thc arguments of Scott and Tilly,87 he argued that \nwhere women had more opportunities for employment (as supposedly in proto- \nindustrial households), and wlhere a greater proportion of thc population was no \nlonger dependent on inheritance for its life chances, therce would be more repetitive \n82 E.

Problems in proto-industrial thcory arising from too narrow a demographic \ncontext also occur in Medick's discussion of seasonality. In traditional rural society \ntherce was a peak in baptisms during thc winter months and a trough during thc \nsummer. Rural domestic industry is said to have reduced these variations, since 'tthc \nreproductive behaviour of proto-industrial populations had detached itself from thc \nrhythms of the agricultural year.'90 Medick points to a similar pattern in 'larger \ncities' from thc seventeenth century,9' but in thc early seventeenth century, London \n(one of thc largest cities in Europe) shared seasonality of baptism patterns with a \nlarge sample of mainly rural parishcs in England.92 Once set in a wider context, an \noccupationally specific explanation alone of these seasonal patterns is hard to \nmaintain: thc same secular trends towards an evening-out of peaks and troughs in \nbaptisms over thc year is visible from thc sixteenth to thc nincteenth century.93 Thc \nprocess quickens after I 750 in England but is apparent in most parishcs well before \nthat date. Changes attributed to proto-industrial development were happening more \nwidely, and in very different con texts.94 \nIv \nAssociated with demographic changes, a number of broadly social structural ones \nare held to have occurred. In order to maximize gross family output, children were \nretained longer in thc 'ganze Haus' among industrial families than in peasant and \nother households.95 Kin might also be used to swell the family labour force, since \nthc marginal cost of including them in thc household was small.96 The result was \nthat 'the average household size of thc rural cottage workers was significantly higher \n88 Levine, Family formation, pp. I27 45; M.

First thc \nhousehold sizc of proto-industrial produccrs was not always 'significantly higher'. \nDamask wcavcrs at Lisburn in Ircland for cxamnplc (i 820- I), actually had a smaller \nhouschold sizc than other wcaving houscholds, and smaller than thosc whosc hcads \nwerc not involved in textiles.98 For southern Flanders in I796 Vandenbrockc has \nshown that wagc-carning textilc workers had a mcan household sizc of only 4- I \npersons, compared to 5'4 for farmers and 4-8 for traditional craftsmcn and \ntradesmcn. The composition of the proto-industrial houscholds diffcred only in the \nlower number of scrvants they contained: the mcan number of rcsident kin and \nchildrcn was almost cxactly the samc as for indepcndent artisans.99 Similarly \nwcavcrs in the industrial quartcr of Bruges in I8I4 had a houschold sizc and \ncomposition which was vcry much in linc with other low-status groups.100 In- \nvolvemcnt in proto-industry did not invariably produce a distinctive houschold \nsizc and composition.101 \nSccondly, the model of the proto-industrial houschold 'takes littlc account of \nintcrnal lifc-cyclc changes within the family system of textile production'*102 E ven \nin periods of rising population it must frequently havc becn impossiblc for industrial \ncommodity producers to cmploy only, or cven mainly, their own children or kin.103 \nSome sort of recoursc to the (activc) market in wage labour in northwestcrn iEurope \nwould havc becn necessary.

Such 'familial' occupations \n(of which proto-industrial employments were a small subset) were clearly differentiated from \nthe smaller families with occupations where the man worked away from home, or where his \nwork commonly disallowed the participation of family members (Snell, Social change and agrarian \nEngland, ch. 7). In this as in other aspects, proto-industrial thcory needs to pay more \ncomparative attention to the large numbers of traditional artisans, who shaded gradually into \nthe category of 'proto-industrial' workers.

Wcalth flowed from the younger \nto the older gencrations; In the canton of Zurich among familics who rctained an \nintcrcst in the land 'childrcn turned their carnings as a mattcr of coursc ovcr to the \ncconomic unit of the family'.107 In landless familics too, childrcn apparcntly \ncontinued to pay part of their carnings for board and lodging.108 \nNow the requisitc cconomic and moral controls ovcr the younger gencration \ncxercised by 'patriarchal domination'109 and buttrcssed by a poorly developed \nwage-labour market might bc availablc in mcditcrrancan and castcrn Europc, but \nwerc ccrtainly not in England nor indecd much of northwestcrn Europc.110 \nProto-industrial thcory is incorrect to claim otherwisc.

But the sort of traditional familial mcntality said to have broken \ndown becausc of proto-industry was largely absent from intcrpersonal rclations in \nEnglish socicty from at lcast the sixtcnth century.119 The samc may well bc truc \nof much of northwestcrn Europc. In the English context argumcnts for a growth \nof affcctivc individualism, a 'risc of romantic lovc' and a transformation of 'crotic \nconsciousncss' duc to the 'liberating' cffccts of proto-industry arc highly dubious.120 \nFinally social changes in the role of womcn are said to havc occurred - an carlicr \n(supposedly rigid) division of labour betwecn the sexes becoming blurred becausc \nof thc new joint inputs of husband and wifc to the family budget. Levine for cxamplc \nclaims that 'becausc wages werc so low in the framework knitting industry it was \nvcry difficult for a family to survivc on the husband's carnings alonc', and the themc \nis strcssed by Mcdick.121 An 'inncr structural changc' occurred, manifcsted 'in the \ntransformation of the division of labour betwcen the sexes, of the configuration of \nroles within the family, and of I.thc] social charactcr of the wholc family '.22 This \ncould go so far under proto-industry 'as to crasc the traditional division of labour \nbetween the sexes and age groups '*123 Proto-industry could cven lcad to 'thc revcrsal \nof traditional roles... the necessitics of production compcllcd womcn to neglect \nhouschold \"dutics\" '.124 Thcsc changes in the sexual division of labour arc held to \nhavc becn closcly bound up with thosc in affcctive and sexual behaviour. 125 \nHowevcr, from the work of Alicc Clark, Pinchbeck, Richards, Sncll and others it \nis clcar that womcn in England beforc the ninctcnth century took part in a widc \nrangc of cmploymcnts, which becamc progrcssively limited to mcn by and during \nthe ninctcnth century.126 In agriculturc and the artisan trades morc gencrally the \nperiod aftcr about I 750 saw a reduction of participation rates for womcn, a changc \naway from carlicr and morc sexually shared work-allocations, which werc themsclves \nduc both to traditional family production and to labour shortages consequent on \ndemographic stagnation and a high lcisurc prefcrcncc. \nThe lack of a sexual division of labour in proto-industrial occupations followed \na similar pattcrn to carlicr artisan family cconomics: womcn in England had becn \napprcnticed to many other trades besides framework knitting or wcaving.127 Therc \nwas nothing novel in their cmploymcnt in cightcnth-century proto-industrial \noccupations.'28 Similarly womcn worked widely in the old-stylc textilc and other \n11 R.

Therc \narc threc main posited connexions: proto-industry provided the opportunity for the \naccumulation of capital which could bc used for investmcnt in the factory system; \nby incrcasing population it provided a labour forcc for industrialization; and \novcrscas markets were secured for their (supposedly all-important) role in absorbing \nfactory producc. \nThe problem raised by Kriedtc of 'assigning cmpirically vcrifiablc indicators' to \nproto-industry is cspecially marked here. Dcbatc on industrialization in Europc is \nstill hindered by paucity of cmpirical data on such aspects as rcal wages and the \nclass, regional and sexual location of the homc market; the rclativc proportions of \ndomestic industrial product absorbed by the homc or ovcrscas market; or the \nsources of labour and capital for factories. Britain is frequently held up as a 'clas- \nsic casc' of the industrializing aspect of proto-industrial theory, and it is fortunatc \nthat its cxpericncc is among the best documcnted. First, it is difficult to asscss the \nthcsis that 'A group of merchant-manufacturcrs, middlemen, and sometimes small \nartisans cmerged who became the agents of industrialization, backed by capital \nwhich they had accumulated during proto-industrialization '.3 Therc is limited \ncvidencc that the transition from handloom to power wcaving was facilitated by in- \nvestmcnt in the lattcr from somc handloom manufacturcrs, especially in the I 82os \nalthough thc thcory would havc this happcning carlicr and on a larger scalc. Somc \nhandloom wcavcrs werc also employed by master spinncrs.132 Howevcr, the long \nand socially unfortunatc persistencc of both forms of production alongsidc each \nother is not suggestivc of cntreprcncurial agreemcnt on the bencfits of changes in \ntechnology or the rcorganization of production. As latc as I830 therc werc about \n6o,ooo power looms in England and Scotland, but still 240,ooo handlooms.133 Nor \nwas therc much ovcrlap by region of handloom and factory power-loom wcaving \nwhich is contrary to proto-industrial theory.134 4Wc should note that this industry is \nputting-out system for thc production of' linen yarn rncn l:)ecame incrcasingly involved in \nagriculturc alonc, whilc women and children werc almost wholly working at spinning.

Somc such connexions did cxist, but they should riot \nbc ovcrdrawn from the prcsent scanty cvidencc. For somc other industrics therc is a \nsuggestion of intcrrclationships, but a gencral or cven predominant association can- \nnot bc substantiated. Sources of capital accumulation werc probably cxtremcly \ndivcrsc.1`36 \nIf the connexion betwecn proto-industrial capital accumulation and industrial- \nization is much less clcar than Mcdick and others assumc, the view that factory \nlabour was mainly comprised of thosc who had migrated from proto-industrial forms \nof production is altogether dubious. In many cascs of coursc - handloom weavers, \nlacc makers or stockingers comc to mind - proto-industrial workers werc cntircly \nantagonistic to the factory both for rcasons of culturc and cconomic intcrcst. The \npoint is repeatedly bornc out in Samucl Bamford's autobiographics.136 Power-loom \nwcaving derived its labour almost cxclusively from sources outsidc handloom-wcaving \nfamilics, and from diffcrcnt arcas. And the common regional scparation of the \nfactory from proto-industrial regions (partly a mattcr of anti-Ludditc cxpedicncy), \ncouplcd with the prevalencc of vcry localized migration ficlds further militates \nagainst this cmphasis on the connexion of proto-industry to thc factory via labour \nsupply. 137 \nFurther it is strcssed that proto-industry crcated, supplied and prepared ovcrscas \nmarkets which werc to bc crucial in the success of the factory system. Kriedtc allows \nthe importancc of a 'strong domestic market' in England's cconomic success, but \nacccpts too rcadily argumcnts which underplay the rolc of this cightcnth-century \nhomc market in favour of what now seems to bc too carly and cxcessivc an cmphasis \non forcign tradc.311 Hc writes of the way 'Ovcrscas, markets for the products of \nEuropean proto-industrics seemcd to bc without limit. It was in this way that the \ncurrcnt of demand camc into being which helped givc risc to the new system of \nproduction. '139 Now it is undeniablc that forcign tradc becamc incrcasingly \nimportant for British industrialization aftcr about i8oo; but for carlicr periods this \nargumcnt is much less convincing. Exports werc an unstablc basis for industrial- \nization in the cightcnth century, pronc to fluctuations cspecially in timc of war.140 \nThe significancc of the growth of the cxport trade was limited by the purchasing \npower of British colonial customers, which in turn was constrained by what they \ncould carn from cxports to Britain. Pcriods of accclerated growth of forcign tradc \n( I 725- 50 and I 780-I 8oo) werc associated with advcrsc shifts in the tcrms of tradc. \n135 A nicat illustrationi of' thc problems of idecitifyiiig 'proto-inidustrial regionis' anid of' \nasscssing thc social impact of proto-industrial production is provided by Arthur Young's \ndescription of Kcndal in Cumbria in thc sccond half of thc cightccnth ccntury.

The ratc of' growth of' cxports was actually declining during \nthe crucial period aftcr I 745, when the growth of'nct imports was much morc marked \nthan- was the casc for cxports. For such rcasons, it has becomc clcar in recent years \nthat the reasons for British economic growtlh after 174.5 must be sought primarily \nat homc. Discussion has shifted to an asscssment of'thc regional, class and cven sexual \nspecificity of the homc market, cspecially in the agricultural sector: a historiographical \ntrcnd ignored by proto-industrial thcory with its overwhelming strcss on the rolc \nof cxports.141 \nFinally, it was the case that many regions of proto-industry (perhaps most) \n'dc-industrialized', and that industrialization occurred in many arcas which had \nlittlc or no cxperiencc of proto-industry. Both points raisc scrious problems for the \nthcory's main prctension: to cxplain how industrialization occurred. Mcdick, \nKriedtc and Schlumbohm's attempts to rcconcilc dc-industrialization with their \nthcory lack conviction. De-industrialization is held to bc an 'cxtremc casc', but \njudging from the cxpericncc of a widc rangc of cottagc industrics in East Anglia, \nKcnt, Sussex and other arcas of southern ELngland, or parts of Lancashirc and \nChcshirc, Wales, Ircland, Scotland, Flanders, Hcssc, cast Wcstphalia, Silesia, \nWiirttemberg, Normandy, parts of Francc (to say nothing of arcas outsidc north- \nwestcrn Europc), dc-industrialization might seem to havc becn the uiszuail pattcrn for \nproto-industrial regions. In all thcsc cascs (as where the factory cmerged from a \nnon-proto-industrial milicu) the theory has littlc credibility. \nThe cxplanations offcred for thcsc 'cxtremc cascs' do littlc to avoid this verdict. \nApparcntly thc conditions crcated by proto-industry \nwere not however suflicient to actually introduce the process of industrialization. For the \ndomestic system of production to be pushecd inito industrialization, a certain general framewor-k \nwas necessary [besides the defininig features of proto-industry I ... If'that framework was lacking \nor insufficiently developed ...the system would collapse altogether, withlout succeeding at \nindustrializationi. 1412 \nBut in such a form this is less a rigorous thcory than an exercisc in tangential \nhistorical possibility. Onc could construct altcrnativc 'tthcorics' by cmphasizing any \nonc of a widc rangc of other factors, and similarly excusc failurc by plcading the \nabsencc of a 'ccrtain gencral framework'. When discussing the causes of industrial- \nization it would seem more helpful to consider the relations betwecn all the factors \nin the specific regional frameworks from which it cmerged. Morcovcr, it seems \nillogical to build a 'thcory' by isolating as the sine qzu(a non of industrialization oiwc \nfactor which sometimes occurred among many others, and cxplaining its failurc to \noccur by the absencc of the others. And when industrialization occurred in the \nabsencc of proto-industry no doubt the other factors werc paramount, so perhaps \nthey should always reccive primary attention. \nTwo other considerations arc raised to try to reconcilc dc-industrialization with \nthe thcory of industrialization. First, wherc proto-industry 'rcsulted in an ovcr-supply \nIll The stress oni overseas markets is of'course tied up with theories about the crucial role \nof'coloiiial trade in overcominig 'the limitations of'the internal market', anid stimulatilng 'the \nutilizationi of'herctofore idle resources', KMS, p. 34. It is also liniked to the thcsis of'progressive \nimmiscratioIn followinig upoIn the progress of'inidustrial capitalism, a view which further detracts \nf'rom consideration of' a broadly based home market. \n112 KMS, pp. I45 6. \nHIS'T'ORIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW 49I \nof labour power, it arrcsted the introduction of capital-intensivc tcchniques; and \nbccausc it favoured the extcnsion of production, it thrcatened to freezc thc forces \nof productioin at the CXiStinIg levce'.143 The problem herc is obvious. Aftcr all, \novcrabundancc of labour is assumed to bc onc of thc cssential precoinditions for the \nagrarian gencsis of proto-industry, and such an ovcr-supply of labour is said to have \nbecn perpetuated by the InCw demographic dynamic crcated by proto- \nindustrialization itsclf. 'Proto-industrialization can bc described as \" cconomic \ndevelopmcnt with unlimited supplics of labour\" '44 It seems contradictory to \ncxplain away the failurc of proto-industrialization in terms alrcady used to definc \nits origins and developmcnt. The unnoticed corollary is that if unlimited labour \nsupplics wcrc necessary for the inccption of rural domestic industry but werc also \nfatal to it, transition to factory production was thcorctically impossiblc. This is hardly \na viablc explanation of industrialization but could bc of thc morc usual development: \ndc-industrialization.'45 Sccondly, competition from Britain is blamed for dc- \nindustrialization. 'British competition had become a serious threat to the industries \non the continent. . . EIngland had gained the upper hand over them in the struggle \nfor the \" appropriation of 'forcign' purchasing power \" '.146 No doubt this did affcct \nmany European arcas and industrics. But what of all the cxamples of dc- \nindustrialization in Britain, ignored by Mcdick el al.? Given the thcory's strict \ncmphasis on ovcrscas markets, this explanation becomes less than adequatc was \nBritain competing against itsclf for colonial markets? Of coursc, the competition \nwhich undercuit southern English rural industrics was largely intcrnal and mainly \naffected them on the homc market. But the cxtent of the lattcr is hcavily underplayed \nby the thcory, as wc saw. Bccausc of this if fails adequatcly to reconcilc itsclf with \nBritish dc-industrialization. \nVI \nTherc arc too many inconsistencics in proto-industrial thcory and too many \nexceptions in practice to dcal with fully in a short articlc. Thcsc problems scriously \nlimit its heuristic valuc. The telescoped and simplistic picture of' traditional socicty \nin carly modern Ejuropc offered by Mcdick and others, for example, has becn shown \nto bc vcry dubious in the casc of FEngland.'47 Another scrious omission is the \nprevalencc of industrial commodity production within towns, not just controllcd by \n113 KMS,lS, p.

The textile towns of the Paris basin had a much faster \nrate of population growth than the surrounding countryside in the eighteenth \ncentury,'5' and the same was true of many contemporary English manufacturing \ntowns before 1780.152 Similarly proto-industrial thcory exaggerates the restrictive \nnature of the guilds in late seventecnth- and eighteenth-century England. Therc were \na smaller number of gildated towns than is implied, and it is also becoming clear \nthat thc institutions of guild, companiy and apprenticeship survived much longer \nthan is often thought well into the period of more marked British economic \ngrowth.'53 They certainly proved more flexible and less inhibitive of urban labour \nsupply than proto-industrial thcory allows. The growth of towns was probably a \nmore potent force promoting agricultural improvement, regional market integration \nand the development of the factory system than was proto-industrialization. \nThe problems abound, and they arc serious ones which severely limit the claims \nof proto-industrial thcory. It is important to construct thcoretical frameworks, but \nin so doing we muist take account of a much wider range of factors in accounting \nfor economic growth and capital formation. Tlhere is little reason why cottage \nindustry should receive prime attention. Many of the points madc about the \n'agricultural origins of industry' are hardly new. Therc has been a lively stimulation \nof research, but we are still little closer to a general or thcoretical understanding \nof the transition from an agrarian to an industrial world. For this reason, \nproto-industi'ial thcory will have to be abandoned, and replaced by a less schematic \nand limiting approach which takes more account of the diversity of European social \nand economic development in thc passage to industrialization. \nIJNIVERSIT'Y OF ST' ANT)REWS RAB HOUJST'ON \nIJNIVERSIT'Y OF YORK K.
