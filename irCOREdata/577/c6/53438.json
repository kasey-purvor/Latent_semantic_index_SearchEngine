INTRODUCTION \n \nBandpass SDMs have many industrial and engineering \napplications because many systems are required to \nperform analog to digital conversions on bandpass signals \n[1]. By using bandpass SDMs, simple and relatively low \nprecision analog components could achieve the \nobjectives. Because of this advantage, this area draws \nmuch attention from the researchers in the community. \nConsequently, some methods for the analysis [3], [4] and \ndesign of bandpass SDMs have been proposed [2]. \nSince the quantization and feedback in bandpass \nSDMs introduces nonlinearities, limit cycles [3] and \nchaos [4] may occur. Some researchers utilize the \nnonlinear behavior in order to suppress unwanted tones \nfrom the quantizers [6]. The most common existing \nmethod is to place some unstable poles in the system \nmatrices, so that chaotic behaviors will be exhibited in \nthe systems, and the rich frequency spectra of these \nchaotic output signals break down the dominant \noscillations at the outputs. However, by placing some \nunstable poles in the system matrices, the stability of the \nsystems is degraded. \nIn the practical situation, there are leakages on the \nintegrators [5]. This originates from the internal \nresistances of the components. Even though the leakages \nmay sometimes be negligible, engineers and circuit \ndesigners may impose leakage on the integrators so as to \nimprove the stability of the overall systems. Therefore, \nthe eigenvalues of the system matrices are strictly inside \nthe unit circle, and the system matrices are actually \nstrictly stable. \nAlthough there are some analytical results on the \nbandpass SDMs [4], most analysis is based on marginally \nstable system matrices only. For the bandpass SDMs with \nstrictly stable system matrices, the existing results are \nprimarily concerned with limit cycles, but not with fractal \nbehavior. Intuitively, systems with stable system matrices \nwill cause the trajectories to converge to some fixed \npoints, and fractal behaviors would not occur. In this \npaper, we show that fractal behavior may also occur, and \nprovide a justification for this and an analysis of its effect. \nThe organization of the paper is as follows. The \nanalytical and simulation results of bandpass SDMs with \nstrictly stable system matrices are given in Section II. \nDiscussion and conclusion are given in Section III. \n \n2. ANALYTICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS \n \nThe bandpass SDMs in [7] with leakages can be modeled \nas follows: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kkkk CuBsAxx \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\uf02b1  for 0\uf0b3k , (1) \nwhere \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05dTkxkxk 21\uf0bax  is the state vector function \nof the system, \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05dTkukuk 12 \uf02d\uf02d\uf0bau  is a vector \ncontaining the past two consecutive points from the input \nsignal \uf028 \uf029ku , \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\n\uf0ba\n\uf071cos2\n10\n2 rr\nA  (2) \nis the system matrix of the system, and \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02d\n\uf0ba\uf0ba\n\uf071cos2\n00\n2 rr\nCB , (3) \nwhere B is the matrix associated with the nonlinearity, C \nis the matrix associated with the input, and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05dTkxQkxQk 21\uf0bas  for 0\uf0b3k , (4) \nin which the superscript T  denotes the transpose operator, \n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf02d\n\uf0b3\n\uf0ba\notherwise\ny\nyQ\n1\n01 , (5) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d0\\,\uf070\uf070\uf071 \uf02d\uf0ce  and 10 \uf03c\uf03c r . As opposed to standard \nlowpass SDM systems, bandpass SDMs are designed to \noperate on high-frequency narrowband signals by shaping \nthe noise from some frequency 0f  [4], where \n\uf070\n\uf071\n20\nsff \uf03d , \nin which \nsf  denotes the sampling frequency. At the \ndesired frequency 0f , it has noise transfer function zero \nand signal transfer function one [4]. When \n\uf07b \uf07d\uf070\uf070\uf071 ,0,\uf02d\uf0ce , the system is either a lowpass SDM or a \nhighpass SDM, which is out of the scope of the paper. \nThe leakage of the system depends on the values of r . If \nr  is closer to 0, then the poles are closer to the origin and \nthe leakage is more serious. If r  is closer to 1, then the \npoles are closer to the unit circle and the leakage is less \nsignificant. For an ideal bandpass SDMs, 1\uf03dr , the \nsystem reduces to that described in [7], and the system \nmatrices are marginally stable. The value of \uf028 \uf029ks  can be \nviewed as symbols, \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d\uf07b \uf07dTTTTk 11,11,11,11 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf0ces  (6) \nfor 0\uf0b3k , and \uf028 \uf029ks  is called a symbolic sequence. \nIn this paper, we only consider the cases when \uf028 \uf029kx  \nand \uf028 \uf029ku  are real signals, that is \uf028 \uf029 2\uf0c2\uf0cekx  and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0c2\uf0ceku . We also assume that \uf028 \uf029ku  is a constant input, \nthat is \uf028 \uf029 uu \uf03dk  for 0\uf0b3k . \n \n2.1.

That implies that all the fixed \npoints (more than or equal to 2) cannot be in the same \nquadrant. For example, if 2\uf03dM , then there are two \nfixed points on the phase plane and these two fixed points \nare located in different quadrants. \nThe significance of Lemma 1 is that it provides \nuseful information for estimating the periodicity of the \nsteady state of output sequences via the phase portrait. \nMoreover, Lemma 1 provides useful information to the \nSDM designers to determine the set of initial conditions \nwhich leads to limit cycle behavior. \nIt is worth noting that although the state vector is \nconverging to a periodic orbit, it never reaches these \nperiodic points. That means, the state vector is aperiodic \neven though the output sequence is eventually periodic. \nThis result is different from the case when 1\uf03dr  and \uf071  is \na rational multiple of \uf070 . \nMoreover, although \uf02aix , for 1,,2,1 \uf02d\uf03d Mi \uf04c , \ndepends on \uf028 \uf029is , for 1,,2,1 \uf02d\uf03d Mi \uf04c , it does not depend \non \uf028 \uf0290x  directly. That is, the fixed points leading to a \ngiven symbol sequence are not directly depended on the \ninitial conditions. \nWhen 1\uf03dM , the output sequence will become \nconstant and there is only one single fixed point on the \nphase portrait. The trajectory will converge to this fixed \npoint, denoted as \uf02ax . The significance of this result is \nthat it allows SDM designers to determine the set of \ninitial conditions so that limit cycle behavior is avoided. \nIt is worth noting that the state vectors of the \ncorresponding linear system will converge to \n\uf028 \uf029 CuAI 1\uf02d\uf02d , which is not the same as that of \uf02ax . \nComparing these two values, there are DC shifts and the \nDC shifts are exactly dropped at the output sequences, \nthat is: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n0\n11\nkBsAIxCuAI\n\uf02d\uf02a\uf02d \uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf02d , (21) \nin which \n\uf028 \uf029\n0k\nk ss \uf03d  for 0kk \uf0b3 . (22) \nIn addition, this phenomenon is quite different from the \ncase of lowpass SDMs. In such a situation, the average \noutput sequence will approximate the input values even \nthough limit cycle behavior occurs. \nAlthough the nonlinearity is always activated, the \nrate of convergence only depends on r  when the output \nsequence becomes steady. This is because the DC terms \ndo not affect the rate of convergence. However, if we look \nat the transient response of the system, that is, the time \nduration when the output sequence is not constant, the \nsystem dynamics could be very complex. \nFigure 1 shows the response of the state variables of \na bandpass SDM with \n9999.0\uf03dr , \uf028 \uf029158532.0cos 1 \uf02d\uf03d \uf02d\uf071 , \uf05b \uf05dT113.0\uf02d\uf03du  \nand \uf028 \uf029 \uf05b \uf05dT5.000 \uf03dx .

Fractal Behaviors \n \nIntuitively, fractals would not be exhibited on the phase \nplane when the system matrices of the bandpass SDM are \nstrictly stable. However, if \n\uf046\uf0b9\uf058\uf0c2\uf0ba\uf058 1\n2\n2 \\ , (25) \nin which \uf046  denotes the empty set, then there exists some \ninitial conditions which would not result in the \nconvergence of the periodic output sequences. Since \n\uf028 \uf029 20 \uf058\uf0ce\uf022x , there does not exist \uf07b \uf07d00 \uf055\uf02b\uf0ce Zk  such that \n\uf028 \uf029 10 \uf058\uf0cekx , the region 1\uf058  in the phase plane has to be \nempty. As a result, a fractal pattern would be exhibited on \nthe phase plane. As the output sequences corresponding \nto limit cycle behaviors are eventually periodic, the output \nsequences for \uf028 \uf029 20 \uf058\uf0ce\uf022x  are aperiodic. \nFigure 3 shows the state trajectory of a bandpass \nSDM with \n6101 \uf02d\uf02d\uf03dr , \uf028 \uf029158532.0cos 1 \uf02d\uf03d \uf02d\uf071 , \uf05b \uf05dT113.0\uf02d\uf03du  \nand \uf028 \uf029 \uf05b \uf05dT5.000 \uf03dx . (26) \n \nFigure 3. The phase portrait when output sequences are \naperiodic. \nIt can be seen from the figure that fractal pattern is \nexhibited on the phase plane and the trajectories neither \nconverge to the boundaries of the trapezoids nor any fixed \npoints in the phase portrait. Measurements of the fractal \ndimension [8] are estimated at 1.78 for the box counting \ndimension, 1.75 for the information dimension, and 1.72 \nfor the correlation dimension. \nOne possible implication of the results obtained in \nthe paper is that it is not necessary to place unstable poles \nin the system matrices of bandpass SDMs to generate \nsignals with rich frequency spectra in order to suppress \nunwanted tones from quantizers. It is shown in this paper \nthat fractals can be generated via system matrices with \nstrictly stable poles. Since the output sequences are \naperiodic, which consist of rich frequency spectra, the \nunwanted tones could be suppressed using these aperiodic \nsignals without the tradeoff of the stability of the systems. \n \n3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n \nIn this paper, we account for the occurrence of fractal \npatterns for bandpass SDMs with strictly stable system \nmatrices. If the sets of initial conditions corresponding to \nthe eventually periodic output do not cover the whole \nphase plane, then fractal patterns would be exhibited. \nSome interesting results are found. First, for a periodic \noutput sequence, the limiting period of the state space \nvariables must equal the period of the symbolic sequence. \nThis implies that all the periodic points cannot be in the \nsame quadrant. If the state vector converges to some fixed \npoints on the phase portrait, these fixed points do not \ndepend on the initial condition directly. \nOne implication of the results obtained in this paper \nis that we can generate signals with rich frequency \nspectra by using strictly stable system matrices in order to \nsuppress unwanted tones generated by the quantizers. \nThus limit cycles may be avoided without a tradeoff in the \nstability of the bandpass SDM. \n \n4.
