Standard economic theory links the \ninterest rate for maturity T to the willingness of a representative agent to substitute consumption \nbetween times 0 and T. The standard model contrasts sharply with a more informal view based \non investors\u2019 preferred habitat, proposed by John Culbertson (1957) and Franco Modigliani and \nRichard Sutch (1966). According to the preferred-habitat view, there are investor clienteles with \npreferences for specific maturities, and the interest rate for a given maturity is influenced by the \ndemand of the corresponding clientele and the supply of bonds with that maturity. For example, \nthe typical clientele for long-term bonds are pension funds. An increase in their demand would \nbe expected to raise prices of long-term bonds and thus lower long-term interest rates. In short, \npreferred habitat implies that there is price pressure in the bond market. \nWhile the preferred-habitat view has intuitive appeal, it has not entered into the academic \nmainstream, typically being relegated to a paragraph in MBA-level textbooks. One reason for \nthis is the mixed findings in early empirical studies of the term structure.  Specifically, between \n1962 and 1964, the US Treasury and Federal Reserve raised the supply of short-term government \ndebt while simultaneously lowering the supply of long-term debt. This program, known as \nOperation Twist, aimed to raise short-term interest rates, and so improve the balance of \npayments, while also lowering long-term rates to stimulate private investment. A number of \npapers evaluated Operation Twist, and while they reached different conclusions, none found \n                                                 \n* Greenwood: Harvard Business School, Baker Library 267, Soldiers Field, Boston MA 02116, USA (email: \nrgreenwood@hbs.edu), and NBER; Vayanos: Department of Finance A350, London School of Economics, London \nWC2A 2AE, UK (email: d.vayanos@lse.ac.uk), CEPR and NBER.

This lack of evidence reflected poorly on the preferred-\nhabitat view, on which the success of the program was predicated. \nA second reason why the preferred-habitat view has not received much academic attention is \ntheoretical. An extreme version of preferred habitat is that the interest rate for a given maturity \nevolves independently of other maturities. If interest rates for nearby maturities were very \ndifferent, then arbitrageurs could realize unbounded profits by exploiting these differences (John \nCox, Jonathan Ingersoll and Stephen Ross (1985)).  \nIn this paper we argue for the relevance of the preferred-habitat view by presenting two \nrecent episodes that strongly support it: the UK pension reform of 2004, and the US Treasury\u2019s \nbuyback program of 2000-2002.1 Building on our other work (Robin Greenwood and Dimitri \nVayanos (2010), Vayanos and Jean-Luc Vila (2009)), we then explain how these episodes can be \nunderstood within a modern theory of preferred habitat. We conclude by discussing the relevance \nof preferred habitat for central bank policies during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. \nIn the episodes that we consider, long-term interest rates experienced large and long-lasting \nshifts because of a regulation-induced change in the demand of a long-maturity clientele in one \ncase, and a government-induced change in the supply of long-term bonds in the other. Thus, a \nbroader message of our analysis is that term-structure movements cannot always be understood \nin terms of changes in expected short-term interest rates, inflation or other macroeconomic \nvariables, but that shifts to clientele demand and bond supply are also an important driver. \nI. The UK Pension Reform of 2004 \n                                                 \n1 Our account of the buyback episode draws on Kenneth Garbade and Matthew Rutherford (2007), who provide a \ngeneral discussion of Treasury buybacks in historical context. \n -3-  \n \nPension reform in the UK over the past twenty years evolved in two major stages. The first \nstage was motivated by the failure of a large corporate pension fund during the early 1990s. The \nPensions Act of 1995 instituted minimum funding requirements, to ensure that pension plan \nmembers could be paid in full even if the sponsoring firm went bankrupt. The funding \nrequirements coincided with accounting reforms that linked the valuation of pension liabilities to \nmarket-based discount rates. The combination of the funding requirements and the accounting \nchange created demand for long-dated assets, lowering bond yields. Because this exposed \nweakness in many pension plans, the act was perceived as exerting undue influence on plans\u2019 \ninvestment policy. At the behest of the pension industry, the regulations were ultimately \nabandoned in the early 2000s.  \nWe focus on the second stage of reform: the Pensions Act of 2004. This legislation created a \ngovernment fund which would serve as a lifeboat for bankrupt schemes. At the same time, a new \npensions regulator was given the power to take over funds that were perceived to be at risk of not \nmeeting their obligations. One of the criteria used by the regulator to determine whether \nintervention was necessary was a plan\u2019s \u201caccounting deficit,\u201d the difference between the market \nvalues of a plan\u2019s assets and its liabilities. Because pension benefits were fixed and could be \nexpected to grow with inflation, the present value of pension liabilities was linked to the price, \nand thus the prevailing yields, of long-term inflation-linked government bonds. Pension funds \nrunning an accounting deficit were said to be \u201cunderfunded.\u201d \nThe best hedge for pension liabilities is the asset providing the discount rate used to calculate \nthe value of these liabilities.  Thus, underfunded pension plans could reduce the volatility of the \ngap in value between their assets and liabilities by buying government bonds. The Pensions Act \n -4-  \n \nof 2004 instituted fines for underfunded pension plans, providing strong incentives to buy more \nlong-term government bonds.  \nFigure 1 shows that as a consequence of the reform, pension funds increased their exposure \nto long-term government bonds and reduced that to equities. Between the first quarter of 2005 \nand the last quarter of 2006, pension funds bought approximately \u20a411 billion of inflation-linked \nbonds and bonds with maturities longer than 15 years. This understates their demand for long-\ndated assets, however, as pension funds swapped as much as \u20a450 billion of interest rate exposure \nin 2005 and 2006 to increase the duration of their assets.2 The net increase in pension funds\u2019 \ndemand for long-dated assets is substantial compared to approximately \u20a473 billion of net \ngovernment issuance of inflation-linked and long-term bonds between April 2005 and March \n2007. \n-\u00a350\n-\u00a340\n-\u00a330\n-\u00a320\n-\u00a310\n\u00a30\n\u00a310\n\u00a320\n\u00a330\nDec-02 Dec-03 Dec-04 Dec-05 Dec-06\nN\net\n P\nur\nch\nas\nes\n (b\nill\nio\nns\n)\nShort-term Bonds Long-term Bonds Equities\nCumulative Net Purchases of:\n \nFigure 1.

The figure plots yields to maturity on a variety of inflation-linked government \nbonds. The spread between the 2035 and 2016 bonds turned negative in October 2003, and \ndecreased throughout 2004 and 2005 to reach an all time low of -0.49% in January 2006.  At that \ntime, the 2035 and 2055 bonds were yielding 0.72% and 0.48%, respectively, which are \nextremely low relative to the historical average of 3% of long real rates in the UK. This inversion \nof the term structure is hard to rationalize based on the expectations hypothesis: one would have \nto argue that expectations about short-term interest rates past 2016 dropped sharply during 2004 \nand 2005, and to levels below 0.5%.  The spread between the 2035 and 2016 bonds reached a \nnew all time low of -0.68% in December 2006.

Real yields on selected U.K. inflation-linked government bonds, December 2002-December 2006.  \nIn response to the change in yields, pension-fund managers lobbied the government to \nexpand the supply of long-term debt, claiming that long-term interest rates reflected a pension-\n -6-  \n \nfund demand-driven bubble. The U.K. Debt Management Office appears to have agreed with this \nassessment\u2014it attributed the drop in long-term yields to \u201cstructural\u201d demand, and acknowledged \nthat \u201clong conventional yields fell to 50-year lows reportedly reflecting sustained purchases of \nlong-dated gilts by the pension industry.\u201d3 In 2005, the government agreed to issue nominal and \ninflation-linked bonds with initial maturities of up to 50 years, simultaneously shifting the \noverall mix of maturities: 55% of total bond sales between April 2005 and March 2006, and 68% \nof total bond sales between April 2006 and March 2007, were long-term or inflation-linked, \ncompared to 45% between April 2004 and March 2005, and 36% between April 2003 and March \n2004.  \nII. Treasury Buybacks of 2000-2001 \nThe US Treasury announced during the fall of 1999 that it was considering a program to buy \nback long-term bonds. The impetus for this decision was that following a few years of budget \nsurpluses, reduced government financing requirements had led to smaller and fewer new bond \nlistings. And because short-term debt had been retiring without being replaced, the average \nmaturity of outstanding debt had increased. Treasury officials argued that buybacks would \n\u201cenhance our ability to exert greater control over the maturity structure of outstanding debt [and] \nwill provide us the option of managing the maturity structure of the debt by selectively targeting \nthe maturities of debt to be repurchased.\u201d4 The final rule was adopted on January 19, 2000, \nalthough Treasury Secretary Summers announced its arrival a few days sooner, on January 13, \n2000. \n                                                 \n3 UK Debt Management Office Annual Review 2005-06, p.4. \n4 U.S. Treasury Press Release August 4, 1999. http:\/\/www.ustreas.gov\/press\/releases\/ls43.htm. \n -7-  \n \nBetween March 2000 and December 2001 the Treasury conducted 42 buybacks covering 42 \nlong-term bonds with a combined face value of $63.5 billion. This was approximately 10% of \nthe December 1999 outstanding value of marketable long-term government bonds of $644 \nbillion, and approximately 2% of all marketable interest-bearing government debt.  The \nweighted-average remaining maturity of repurchased bonds was approximately 18 years, ranging \nfrom the 11.75% 2010 bond to the 6.125% 2027 bond.  \nFigure 3 shows the dramatic effects of the buybacks on the term structure. Prior to the \nannouncement of the final rule, on January 18, the spread between the 20- and the 5-year spot \nrates was 0.26%. Three weeks later, on February 8, the spread had decreased to -0.39%, a drop \nof 0.65%. The sharp drop in the spread was mainly driven by the 20-year spot rate, which fell by \n-0.58%; the 5-year spot rate rose by 0.07%.  \n5.80\n6.00\n6.20\n6.40\n6.60\n6.80\n7.00\n3-\nJa\nn\n10\n-J\nan\n17\n-J\nan\n24\n-J\nan\n31\n-J\nan\n7-\nFe\nb\n14\n-F\neb\n21\n-F\neb\n28\n-F\neb\n6-\nM\nar\n13\n-M\nar\n20\n-M\nar\n27\n-M\nar\nYi\nel\nd \n(%\n)\n1-year bond 5-year bond 10-year bond 20-year bond\n \nFigure 3. Yields on 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year zero-coupon bonds, January \u2013 March 2000. \nWhile the buybacks targeted only bonds with maturities of 9 years or longer, they appear to \nhave impacted the yields on intermediate-term bonds as well. The spread between the 5- and the \n1-year spot rates dropped from 0.43% on January 18, to 0.33% on February 8, then to -0.11% on \n -8-  \n \nMarch 31. Thus, while the buybacks had larger and more immediate effects on long-term interest \nrates, they appear to have contributed to a more general inversion of the term structure.  \nIII.  Theory \nThe episodes described in Sections I and II are hard to rationalize within the standard \nrepresentative-agent model: to explain the decrease in long-term interest rates, one would have to \nargue that the UK pension reform or the US Treasury buybacks signaled significant drops in \naggregate consumption 20-30 years into the future.5 On the other hand, both episodes support the \npreferred-habitat view: the UK pension reform was a positive shock to the demand for long-term \nbonds, while the US Treasury buybacks were a negative shock to the supply of long-term bonds. \nConsistent with the preferred-habitat view, long-term rates fell relative to short-term rates. \nA salient feature of these episodes is that the effects of demand and supply shocks were not \nisolated to the specific maturities of the shocks\u2019 location. For example, while the Treasury \nbuybacks targeted only bonds with maturities of 9 years or more, their effect on rates extended to \nthe 5-year maturity. Similarly, while the effects of the UK pension reform were most pronounced \nfor the longer maturities, the spread between the yields of intermediate- and short-term bonds \nnarrowed as well. One would expect such effects because bonds with nearby maturities are close \nsubstitutes\u2014therefore arbitrageurs transmit shocks local to one maturity to nearby maturities.  \nCharacterizing how demand and supply shocks manifest themselves in an arbitrage-free term \nstructure requires a formal model of preferred habitat. Vayanos and Vila (2009) develop such a \nmodel, which Greenwood and Vayanos (2010) extend to accommodate shocks to debt maturity \nstructure. The term structure in the model is determined through the interaction between investor \nclienteles who prefer bonds with specific maturities, and risk-averse arbitrageurs. Without \n                                                 \n5 Or, in the spirit of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure, one would have to argue that these episodes \nsignaled significant drops in short-term interest rates in the distant future.  \n -9-  \n \narbitrageurs, the term structure would exhibit extreme segmentation: the yield for a given \nmaturity would be influenced only by the demand of the corresponding clientele, and would \nevolve independently of other maturities. Such segmentation does not happen in equilibrium, \nhowever. Arbitrageurs intermediate across maturity markets, buying bonds with maturities for \nwhich clientele demand is low, and selling bonds with maturities for which demand is high. \nTheir presence ensures that bonds with nearby maturities trade at similar prices.  \nIn bridging markets across different maturities, arbitrageurs face both fundamental and non-\nfundamental risk. The fundamental risk is that the short-term interest rate rises (falls) in the \nfuture, thereby flattening (steepening) the term structure. The non-fundamental risk is that there \nwill be shocks to the demand for bonds with particular maturities. Because arbitrageurs are risk \naverse, they receive compensation for accommodating demand shocks. If arbitrageurs\u2019 risk \naversion is low, then changes in short-term interest rates are the dominant source of risk, and \ndemand shocks affect the term structure by altering the market price of short-rate risk. This in \nturn implies that the specific location of demand effects is unrelated to that of the underlying \nshocks: bonds most sensitive to the shocks are those most sensitive to changes in the market \nprice of short-rate risk. If arbitrageurs\u2019 risk aversion is high, however, then multiple risk factors \nbecome relevant. In this case, arbitrageurs are less able to intermediate across maturity markets, \nand demand effects become more local. \nIV.  Policy Implications \nThe preferred-habitat view of the term structure is particularly relevant in the context of \nrecent central bank policies. In the midst of the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, central \nbanks around the world conducted unprecedented open-market purchases of long-term \nsecurities\u2014all with the hope of influencing long-term bond yields. The largest of these programs \n -10-  \n \nwas the Federal Reserve\u2019s asset purchase program, which initially targeted government-backed \nagency securities and agency-backed mortgage-backed securities, and later expanded to include \nlong-term government bonds.  \nRemarkably, the motivation for these government purchase programs was similar to that of \nOperation Twist, suggesting a revival of policy interest in the preferred-habitat view. For \nexample, the December 2008 minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) outline \nBoard members\u2019 view that purchases would reduce interest rates on long-term instruments, \nwhich in turn would stimulate private borrowing and investment.  \n2.50\n2.60\n2.70\n2.80\n2.90\n3.00\n3.10\n3.20\n3.30\n3.40\n3.50\n-2 -1 +0 +1 +2\n20\n-y\nea\nr y\nie\nld\n -\n1-\nye\nar\n yi\nel\nd \n(%\n)\nDays from Announcement\nMarch 18, 2009 \nNovember 25, 2008\nDecember 15, 2008\n \nFigure 4.

All three events were \n -11-  \n \naccompanied by a drop in the spread, with the average drop being 0.30%. Moreover, the drop \nwas mainly driven by the 20-year yield, which fell by an average of 0.33%. \nWhile a theory of preferred habitat is useful for evaluating these recent central bank \ninterventions, there remain important empirical challenges. First, developing precise quantitative \nestimates of the price impact of supply and demand shocks on the term structure is difficult \nbecause shifts to the supply and demand for bonds are infrequent, and because the availability of \narbitrageur capital may fluctuate over time. A second and related challenge is that the desirability \nof central bank intervention depends in large part on whether supply shocks have transitory or \npermanent effects on interest rates. If the effects are only transitory, then government actions to \nalter the term structure are expensive. Yet, to distinguish between transitory and permanent \neffects would require the econometrician to identify numerous exogenous shocks to bond supply \nor demand. A third challenge is that one must account for segmentation not only across \nmaturities, but also across types of bonds, e.g., Treasuries, mortgage-backed and corporate. For \nexample, announcement effects of the Federal Reserve buybacks differed between mortgage-\nbacked securities and Treasury bonds, suggesting segmentation between the two markets (Xavier \nGabaix, Arvind Krishnamurthy and Olivier Vigneron (2007), Krishnamurthy and Annette \nVissing-Jorgensen (2009)).  \n -12-  \n \nReferences \nCox, John C., Jonathan Ingersoll and Stephen A.
