A common theme that appears to have \nchanged little (Ackoff, 1989; Dearing, 1997; Conaway et al, 2005; Falconer, 2006) is \nthat students are very keen on using the Internet for entertainment, peer \ncommunication, and for secondary sources of data.  Researchers (Lissenburgh, 1999; \nHamilton and Scandura, 2003; Macfayden, 2005) claim that, in some cases, students \nassume the information does not exist if it is not available on the Internet.  \n \nAlthough students are familiar with Internet technology, some researchers (Gladstone, \n2000; Wang and Ahmed, 2003; Hannon and D\u2019Netto, 2007) argue that students often \nlack the specific skills that would enable them to use it more effectively. It could be \nthat students are not clear of the benefits from the outset (Ashraf, 2009). A recent \nsurvey (Student Expectations Study, 2007) reported that, whilst many current and \nprospective students are comfortable with the learning technologies both used and \navailable, this new generation of students like to see the concrete benefits of \ntechnology usage and implementation, i.e. that work is recognised and contributes to \nfinal grade assessment.    \n \nThis paper will review e-learning and IT as learning technologies in order to evaluate \nif they can be used to replace the traditional style lecture.  \n \nEvidence of Internet use \n \nAccording to the 2005 Oxford Internet survey ninety two percent of people go on line \nto check emails, seventy four percent buy on line and forty three percent play games, \nforty two percent look for jobs.  However, only twenty one percent use it for distance \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n2\nlearning purposes.  Even use of the internet to download to watch videos and listen to \nthe radio achieved an almost ten percent better score than distance learning. It is also \nevident that there has been a decline in the number of people developing websites, \nand using the Internet for creative purposes. Another finding which is disappointing \nfor learning purposes is that twenty percent read less due to the advent of the Internet.  \nThis suggests the internet is not a perfect substitute for knowledge, and that lecturers \nneed to encourage both means to foster more creativity.

Twenty fundamental reasons why we go online (Oxford Internet Survey, 2005)  \n \nKnowledge Transfer using E-Learning and Learning Technologies in HE  \n \nResearch indicates (Hannon and D\u2019Netto, 2007; Owens, 2002, 2006; Macfayden, \n2005; Wang and Ahmed, 2003) that E-Learning is perceived as a key enabler to \nKnowledge Transfer (KT) within the HE sector.  E-learning can be used to facilitate \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n3\nKT in a number of ways, as set out in Figure 1.  The successful introduction and \nimplementation of e-Learning into existing and new units at Higher Education \nInstitutes (HEI\u2019s) is heavily influenced by the institution\u2019s ability to deliver \nknowledge based products.  Also research indicates (Conaway et al, 2005; \nGoodfellow and Lea, 2007) HEI\u2019s need to be effective at managing any number of \nstrategic issues that may arise as part of the development of KT though e-Learning \nproducts. \n \n \nIndustry e-Business \nEducation Knowledge Transfer \nSupport Structure \n\u2022 Tutor, Lecturer, Mentor, Learning Network, Friend, & \nTrainer \nSource \n\u2022 On-line \n\u2022 Internet \n\u2022 Intranet \n\u2022 CD-ROM \n\u2022 DVD \n\u2022 TV & Video \n\u2022 Books etc\u2026 \n\u2022 Self-Discovery \n\u2022 Action Learning \n\u2022 Lecture \n\u2022 Seminars \n\u2022 Job Shadow \n\u2022 Role Play \n\u2022 Discussion Groups etc\u2026\nRecipient \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         Figure 1 Model of Knowledge Transfer Education to Business (Owens and McManus, 2004) \n \nThe most significant strategic issues (Conaway et al, 2005) to consider when \nimplementing e-Learning as a tool for KT through traditional and independent study \nwithin the HE sector are:   \n\u2022 Identifying the customer service imperative for each stakeholder or institute \ninvolved in an e-Learning initiative. \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n4\n\u2022 Appreciating the advantages and disadvantages of incremental KT through e-\nLearning in HE. \n\u2022 Understanding the value of national, integrated approaches to e-Learning and \nKT in HE. \n\u2022 Understanding the need to develop user support systems, to underpin e-\nLearning and KT developments. \n\u2022 Working within technological and financial limitations associated with HEI\u2019s \n\u2022 Successful internationalisation of University Education.  \n \nDeveloping KT schemes with the aid of e-Learning is expensive both in time and \nmoney (Owens and McManus, 2004).  Consequently, before making the investment, \nHEI\u2019s may prefer to establish if it is worthwhile (Goodfellow, 2005).  It may therefore \nbe beneficial to have a strategy in place for sustaining and embedding the institutes \nproposed KT and e-Learning developments.  Owens and McManus (2004) suggest \nthere are two schools of thought when considering the integration of KT and e-\nLearning.   \n \n1. The exploration of technologies currently known and understood to produce \nsound learning and teaching KT through the model (see figure 1).  Where the \ncurrent technologies available in the HEI do not allow this, then both internal \nand external developers should be encouraged to assess if new technologies \nare necessary, in order to provide a feasible solution for all parties involved in \nthe KT process.   \n2. To examine the current technologies within the HEI and explore the \npossibilities for innovation that can lead to the development of new \npedagogies and enhance the KT process in the model.  This school of thought \nbelieves that the potential of the technology that currently exists has not yet \nbeen fully investigated.  Thus, it focuses on the premise of embedding new \npractices before moving onto new technologies to assist the KT process.    \n \nLearning Technologies \n \nResearch (Gladstone, 2000; Reeder et al, 2004; Weller, 2004) suggests that academics \nhave accepted the idea that Information Technology (IT) can be effectively used for \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n5\nteaching and learning. According to Roberts (2004), students increasingly expect the \npresence and use of IT in Higher Education (HE). In some environments the high \npenetration of IT has become the norm or at least one of the indicators of the quality \nof a university or faculty (Lanham and Zhou, 2003). Alexander (2002) claims new \nstudents expect the institutions to offer up-to-date IT and Internet access. Further \nstudies suggest (Goodfellow, 2004; Goodfellow and Lea, 2007) that some institutions \nare using IT as a competitive advantage in order to attract more students in an \nincreasingly competitive HE market. More and more, students expect lecturers to use \nIT for teaching and learning (Goodyear and Jones, 2003). This is particularly true for \nmature and distance learning students who are often in full-time employment and \nfrom a working environment, where IT is a fundamental tool (Lanham and Zhou, \n2003).  \n \nAn Evaluation of some of the Learning Technologies available \n \nLearning technology can effectively assist teaching when it is seen as one of a set of \nactivities aimed at supporting students\u2019 learning (Akgun et al, 2003; Boyce, 2003; \nChou, 2003). This approach corresponds to the level three of Biggs\u2019 student-centred \ntheory about teaching (Biggs, 1999). Here, student learning depends on the student\u2019s \nability, prior knowledge and accessible new knowledge on the academic subject\/field, \nincluding teacher responsibility, decision-making and good management. Therefore, \ngood teaching, including the use of learning technologies, involves an awareness of \ncontextual dependency of learning and teaching (Borstorff and Lowe, 2007; Falconer, \n2006; Goodfellow, 2005; Gosper et al, 2008). \n \nThe evaluation of learning technologies includes examining the intentions, \nimplementation process and the outcomes of technology use (Hannon and D\u2019Netto, \n2007). According to Jackson (1998) and Sims and Jones (2002) the purpose of \nevaluating learning technologies is to provide the designer or user with enough \nevidence on which to make confident judgements regarding the effectiveness of the \ninnovation.  He also claims that the match between the intentions and outcomes \ndetermines the success; therefore it is important that the intentions add value to \nstudent learning. According to Elkin (2005) success can also lead to further expansion \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n6\ninto the international education market where specialist focus on Europe should lead \nto a niche market for UK and EU Higher Education providers. \n \nExisting research suggests (Jackson, 1998; Gladstone, 2000; Falconer, 2006, \nGoodfellow, 2007; Gosper et al, 2008) learning technologies can be evaluated against \nintended outcomes such as ease of use, efficiency, student preferences, technology \nattractiveness, and cost effectiveness.  \n \nUsing IT for teaching and Learning \n \nBorstorff and Lowe (2006) claim the introduction of IT represents an additional \nburden on lecturers\u2019 timetables, as it requires co-ordination and integration of the \nactivities in the teaching programme. In order to be effective, IT must reflect the \ncurrent constructivist-learning model that over the last few decades evolved from \nbehaviourist and objectivist models (Fry et al, 1999; Borstorff and Lowe, 2007). \nAbove all, IT-enabled learning must foster interaction and dialogue between the \nlearner(s) and the teacher (Goodfellow, 2005). Research (Institute of Teaching and \nLearning Seminar, 2003; Roberts, 2004; Goodfellow and Lea, 2007) suggests that \nlearning using IT can be enhanced in all sorts of ways, including hearing, seeing, as \nwell as participating in activities such as a game or quiz.  \n \nHannon and D\u2019Netto (2007) argue that the potential of learning technologies to \nimprove learning depends on the context of learning and assessment. The context is \ndefined by the combination of its elements that include the students, lecturers, \ninstitution, teaching material, style and method. Research by Ashraf (2009), \nGoodfellow (2007) and Gosper et al (2008) claim the majority of studies in this area \nfail to provide solid evidence of increased effectiveness of the IT for teaching and \nlearning.  As discussed earlier (Student Expectations Study, 2007), when considering \ntechnology, there should perhaps be a manner of caution in adoption and utilisation.  \nThis is because HEI\u2019s cannot assume that presenting new technologies automatically \nmakes their institutions \u201cyouth friendly\u201d, this new generation would like to see some \nconcrete benefits of technology.  Additionally, Gosper et al (2008) report that IT for \nteaching and learning contributes to a \u201cblurring\u201d of the boundaries between \ntraditional (full-time) and non-traditional (part time, distance learning) students.  This \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n7\nis primarily because its introduction is more than solely a teaching issue as it can \naffect the design of the unit and programme, as well as having professional and \norganisational development implications. \n \nThe literature indicates that students are enthusiastic (Jackson, 1998; Roberts, 2004) \nabout the IT, and they take the medium more seriously when their work is assessed \n(Fry et al, 1999; Borstorff and Lowe, 2004). However, both Hannon and D\u2019Netto \n(2007) and Goodfellow (2007) state IT fails to enable the achievement of significantly \ndifferent learning outcomes. They also suggest that organisational and logistical \nproblems combined with technical difficulties mean that the IT cannot always be used \nto its full potential. In order to work more effectively, learning technologies must be \nfully embedded in a course and students must be provided with the adequate skills and \nsupport (Falconer, 2006; Turban et al, 2000). \n \nMethodology  \n \nThe fieldwork for this research took place at two UK HEI\u2019s; Lincoln Business School \n(LBS), University of Lincoln and Buckinghamshire Business School (BBS), \nBuckinghamshire New University. A number of units that included IT-based learning \nwere identified at both HEI\u2019s.   \n \nThree units that offered similar content and level were selected for this study.  All the \nunits include a web site aimed at supporting students\u2019 learning.  The site gives the \nlecturer some degree of flexibility in terms of inclusion of teaching material, and \nsetting up the discussions despite being fairly standardised. The cohort for this study \nincludes both undergraduate and postgraduate students studying fulltime at both \nHEI\u2019s. \n \nThe fieldwork included an unstructured interview\/discussion with the lecturer for each \ncohort and a questionnaire for the students. The discussion with the lecturer aimed to \nidentify the main issues related to use of the web site that emerged during the \nsemester.  The issues identified through this discussion formed the basis for the \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n8\nquestionnaire distributed to the students towards the end of the semester.

Although \nstandardised to some extent, the web site offers a certain degree of flexibility. The \nlecturer was able to publish the lecture notes, the syllabus, the module outline, the \nassessment brief and any other text material. The related web links could be edited at \nthe discretion of the lecturer who has the control over the content of the web site. \nAdditionally, the lecturer could set up a discussion area by proposing a topic and \nencouraging student participation. Typically, the lecturer posted a question related to \nthe lecture on a weekly basis. The students could respond or comment on the topic \nand get the lecturer\u2019s feedback. The students could see the contributions of their \nfellow students but could not address the comment to one particular student. Similar \nto research by Chou (2003), the communication channel corresponded to the \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n9\ninteractive of one-to-many model. Each participant was identified through a username \nand a password.   \n \nThe discussion with the lecturer allowed for identification of main themes and items \nthat were then included in the questionnaire.  For example, ascertaining how often the \nstudent accessed the discussion area, if they found it helpful, and if they contributed.  \nThe feedback helped to build a picture of the level of interaction between the student \nand the lecturer using internet-based learning.  Once the questionnaire had been \ndrafted, it was reviewed by the lecturer, and the final version administered to students \nduring one of the last sessions in semester one.  This is similar to Goodfellow\u2019s \n(2007) thoughts on encouraging links between the two parties involved in the learning \nprocess.    \n \nQuestionnaires   \n \nThe following results combine the findings from both LBS and BBS across all levels \ninvestigated.   \n \nFeedback from Certificate in Management Studies (CMS) for the Operations \nManagement module at LBS and BBS.   \n \nThese students scored the lowest usage rate of the three groups involved in this \nresearch. Only twenty one percent of respondents at LBS and nineteen percent of \nrespondents at BBS log on to the web site at least once a week. Approximately two \nthirds of the students at the two institutes visit the web site once per month or less, or \nnot more than five times in a semester.  \n \nWhen the students log on they mostly look at the lecturer\u2019s questions but only one in \nfour contributes to the discussion. Across both institutes approximately two thirds \nlook at the contributions of other students and use the web links. Less than half use \nthe web based lecture notes and less than a third use other material related to the \nassessment.  This finding is not surprising as it supports the common view (Fry et al, \n1999; Borstorff and Lowe, 2007), that the student will only take this medium of study \nmore seriously if it is assessed.  Hannon and D\u2019Netto (2007) comment that the real \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n10\npotential of learning technologies to improve the student\u2019s learning experience \ndepends upon the context of learning and assessment.  \n \nAt both institutes, the majority of students feel the web site helps their learning, \nmakes it easier to keep up to date with the lectures, offers the opportunity to discuss \nquestions with the lecturer, and ask for clarifications.  The use of the website therefore \npromotes efficiency, effectiveness, ease of use and attractiveness as a mode of \nlearning (Jackson, 1998; Gladstone, 2000; Falconer, 2006, Goodfellow, 2007).   \n \nHowever, a large majority of students at both institutes do not think the web site gives \nthe lecturer a tool to monitor their learning, nor themselves the opportunity to show \nhow much they study.  This is supported by both Goodfellow (2005) and Ashraf \n(2009), who identified this to be a particular constraint.  They suggest more \ndevelopment needs to be undertaken with this mode of learning in order to achieve its \nfull potential for both lecturers and students.  The implications for students who are \ntechnically competent is that the use of web-based interaction may deliver \u2018concrete\u2019 \nbenefits which involves measuring their level of understanding and improvement. \n \nAnother common finding from both institutes was that the vast majority would like \nthe web site to contain more assessment\/learning-related material.  There were \ndiffering views on whether web-based activities should be included as part of a broad \nportfolio of activities, or be subject to formal assessment.  Approximately half the \nstudents welcome the inclusion of web-based work as part of a broad portfolio, where \nthe work is assessed solely on a pass\/fail basis.   However, less than a third would like \nweb-based activities to be formally assessed and included as part of the final grade.   \nThis is similar to findings from Hannon and D\u2019Netto (2007), who suggest this mode \nof learning should be part of the student\u2019s assessment.  Finally, approximately half of \nthe respondents would like the web site to be more enjoyable to use. \n \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n11\nFeedback from the BA 3 Strategic Management module at LBS and BBS.   \n \nAlmost two thirds of the students at each institute visit the web site at least every \nother week. They predominantly use the lecture notes, look at the lecturer\u2019s questions, \nand at the contributions from other students. However, only seventeen percent at LBS \nand fourteen percent at BBS have ever contributed to the discussion on the web site.   \n \nSimilar to earlier findings with the CMS cohort, the students at both institutes felt that \nthe web site helps their learning; makes it easier to keep up to date with the lectures, \noffers the opportunity to discuss questions with the lecturer, and to ask for \nclarifications. Approximately one in four at LBS and one in three at BBS agree that it \nshould be part of the portfolio of activities.  However, an interesting finding was that \nthe majority of students studying this module at both institutes agreed that web-based \nwork should not be formally assessed for this module at this level of study.  This did \nnot follow earlier trends in this research, nor the literature (Hannon and D\u2019Netto, \n2007), where students would prefer to see it as part of their assessment.  A possible \nexplanation for this could be that, as this group comprised level three students, they \nwere more aware of the significance of grade at this stage of their degree programme.  \nThey perhaps preferred the familiarity and \u2018concrete benefits\u2019 (Student Expectations \nStudy, 2007) of the traditional assessment methods.   \n \nThe vast majority of students at both institutes were of the opinion that they would \nuse it more often if there was more material related to the module assessment.  This \nfinding is similar to previous research (Falconer, 2006, Goodfellow, 2007) whereby \nrelevance to the course and supporting the teaching curriculum. \n \nFeedback from the BA 2 Management of Operations module at LBS and BBS.   \n \nIt was both an interesting and common finding at both institutes that almost half (forty \nnine percent LBS and forty seven percent BBS) of the students use the web site on a \nweekly basis.  This was perhaps an expected finding at level three undergraduate, \nrather than level two undergraduate because of the maturity of the student towards \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n12\nlearning and, the weighting of the degree programme at the final level in England and \nWales.  \n \nSimilar to the previous two cohorts, these students mostly use the lecture notes; they \nlook at the lecturer\u2019s questions and use the web links.  Across both institutes,  \napproximately half the respondents think the web site helps their learning and that it \nmakes it easier to keep up to date with the lectures.  This is a finding supported by \nGoodyear and Jones (2003), who identify that there is a clear expectation by students \nto use IT for teaching and learning.  One in three at LBS and one in four at BBS \nthought that it offered them the opportunity to have discussions with the lecturer, ask \nquestions, to show how much they study, and that it should be part of the portfolio. \nHowever, only one in four at both institutes thought it should be assessed. \n \nThe students at both institutes were of the opinion they would use the web site more \noften if it counted towards the final mark, if there was additional learning material and \nif there was more material related to the assessment.  Another common finding was \nthat the lecturer should promote the web site more convincingly during the lectures \nand seminars. It should also be easier to use and it should be part of the portfolio of \nactivities. \n \nFindings \nThe key findings from the survey of students are summarised in Table 3.

Assessment could \nconsist of a small component of the unit\u2019s total marks. For example, there were \npositive aspects for including the web-based work in the portfolio of activities, and a \nsmall minority of students supported making it count toward their final mark. \nHowever, students said they would be more likely to undertake work that they would \nbe rewarded for, which suggests that some kind of assessment of web-based activity \ncould promote use of e-learning.  Macfayden (2005) claims that this is part of human \nnature and that the students will not do anything unless they clearly benefit through a \ncontribution to their grade.   \n \nEducation is on the threshold of being transformed through the application, \nintegration and utilisation of learning technologies in UK HEI\u2019s.  However, it has \nbeen on the threshold for some time now (Laurillard, 2008).  Personalisation, \nflexibility of delivery and inclusion of a wider participation are cited (Laurillard, \n\u00a9 Owens J D and Price E (2010) \nEducation and Training Journal, vol. 52, no. 2, pp 128-139. \n14\n2008) as being key ambitions for learning technologies in education.  However, \nperhaps we should not fully enter the route of making HE \u201ctechno friendly\u201d institutes, \nbecause as discussed the current generation want to see the concrete benefits (Student \nExpectations Study, 2007) of \u201cclick and mortar\u201d (Ashraf, 2009) learning before they \nsign up.  The contributions of Internet learning should therefore count towards the \ncompletion of only part of the module (Goodfellow, 2005). \n \nConclusion \n \nAn encouraging thought (from a traditional perspective) is that, for now, it appears \nthis mode of learning will act only in a supportive capacity to the traditional teaching \nand learning approach at HEI\u2019s.  So, in an attempt to address the question, \u201cIs E-\nLearning replacing the traditional Lecture?\u201d  the indication from this research is not \nat the moment.  From a wider perspective it is impossible to say but it may not be as \nfar away as we think.  Ashraf (2009) claims that, by the end of 2010, more than fifty \npercent of all courses offered will be a hybrid of face-to-face and online learning and \nmore than eighty percent of students will use mobile technology as a tool for learning.  \n \nReferences \n \n \n\u2022 Ackoff, R L (1989).
