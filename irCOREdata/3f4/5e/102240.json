Traditionally work has focused on materials with the fluorite (e.g. doped \nZrO2, CeO2) or perovskite (e.g. doped LaGaO3) structures [1]. Such materials are \ntypically doped with aliovalent cations with the aim of introducing oxygen vacancies, \nand oxide ion conduction can then proceed via these vacant sites. The detailed \nresearch on fluorite and perovskite systems has essentially reached the state of the art \nthat can be achieved in such structures. Therefore the search for new electrolytes has \nnow begun to target alternative structures, and in this respect apatite-type materials \nhave been attracting significant interest. \nResearch interest in this area has grown following the initial reports by Nakayama et \nal. of high oxide conductivities (>10-3Scm-1 at 500\u00b0C) in rare earth silicates, Ln10-\nxSi6O26+y, with the apatite structure [2-18]. The structure of these materials is shown \nin figure 1. It consists of isolated SiO4 units with the rare earth cations located in 9 \ncoordinate and 7 coordinate channel sites. The remaining oxide ions occupy one-\ndimensional channels running through the structure, which are considered as vital for \nthe high oxide ion conduction in these materials.  \nInitial work in this area assumed that the conduction was mediated by oxide ion \nvacancies as for the fluorite, and perovskite systems. However, the weight of \nexperimental and theoretical evidence indicates that these apatite-type materials \nconduct via an interstitial mechanism [19-23]. The presence of oxygen interstitials has \nbeen linked to the high observed conductivity in both oxygen excess samples, e.g. \n 4 \nLa9BaSi6O26.5, and compositions showing vacancies on the La sublattice, e.g. \nLa9.33Si6O26. In contrast samples which are fully stoichiometric, e.g. La8Ba2Si6O26, \nshow poor conductivity due to a lack of interstitial oxygen site occupancy [9, 16-18].  \nComputer modelling and neutron powder diffraction studies have contributed \nsignificantly to the further understanding of these materials. The modelling studies \nidentified a new energetically favourable interstitial oxide ion position at the \nperiphery of the oxide ion channels, in the vicinity of the SiO4 groups [19,20]. \nExperimental studies have provided confirmation of this position, with Leon-Reina et \nal. showing occupation of a similar site in neutron diffraction studies of the \nLa9.33+x(Si\/Ge)6O26+3x\/2 systems, and Kharton et al.  reporting penta-coordinated Fe3+ \nin M\u00f6ssbauer studies of La10Si5FeO26.5 [21-24]. Moreover, the modelling results \nfurther suggested a complex sinusoidal conduction pathway down the channels. This \npathway involves migration across the face of a silicate tetrahedral unit, coupled with \nconsiderable local relaxation of the silicate substructure (figure 2). Experimental \nobservations of relevance to this proposed importance of the silicate substructure \ninclude the differing effects of rare earth vs Si site doping outlined below, and recent \nsolid state 29Si NMR studies, which have shown a correlation between the silicon \nenvironment and the observed conductivity [25].  \nIn terms of doping studies, a wide range of dopants have been reported [17, 23-39], \nRare earth site: Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Bi, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu \nSi site: Ge, Ti, P, B, Al, Ga, Mn, Co, Fe, Mg, Zn, Ni, Cu   \nInitial studies showed that doping with lower valent ions, e.g. B3+, Al3+, Ga3+, on the \nSi site, while maintaining oxygen stoichiometry, i.e. La9.33+x\/3Si6-xMxO26 (M=B, Al, \nGa), leads to an enhancement in the conductivity. In contrast similar doping with \nlower valent ions on the La site, i.e. La9.33-x\/3M2x\/3Si6O26 (M=Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) \n 5 \nproduces no such enhancement but rather tends to lower the conductivity [31]. Aside \nfrom noting the importance of the Si site in the conduction process, the origin of this \ndifferent behaviour has still not been fully explained, and so requires further study. \nMost recently, it has been reported that Mg, Zn doping on the Si site, i.e. La9.33+2x\/3Si6-\nxMxO26 (M=Mg, Zn) also produces a similar large enhancement in conductivity [34, \n35, 38]. Transport measurements have indicated that the conductivity is indeed due to \noxide ions [34]. Mg doping is particularly interesting as this dopant can also be \nsubstituted onto the La site, i.e. La9.33-x\/3Mg2x\/3Si6O26, in this case leading to a \nreduction in conductivity. Thus Mg is an ambi-site dopant in La9.33Si6O26, substituting \non either site depending on the starting composition. It therefore provides an ideal \nprobe for the systematic investigation of the differing effects of La versus Si site \nsubstitution. With this in mind we report here a neutron powder diffraction structural \nstudy for 4 Mg doped samples, all having the same nominal oxygen content (O26), to \ninclude 2 samples doped only on the Si site, La9.5Si5.75Mg0.25O26, La9.67Si5.5Mg0.5O26, \none sample doped only on the La site, La9Mg0.5Si6O26, and one sample doped on both \nthe La and Si site, La9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26. The neutron diffraction work is supported \nby atomistic simulation studies of the local perturbations caused by a Mg dopant on \nthe La and Si sites, and the results are correlated with conductivity measurements.  \n \nExperimental \n \n \nFour Mg doped samples were synthesised, La9.5Si5.75Mg0.25O26, La9.67Si5.5Mg0.5O26, \nLa9Mg0.5Si6O26, La9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26. The samples were prepared from the dried \nstarting materials La2O3, SiO2, MgO. Stoichiometric mixtures were intimately ground \n 6 \nand heated for 16 hours at 1350\u00baC with a second firing at 1400-1500\u00baC for a further \n16 hours. Between firings the samples were reground to ensure homogeneous reaction, \nwith phase purity being examined using a Seifert 3003TT powder X-ray \ndiffractometer.  \nConductivity measurements were performed using AC impedance spectroscopy \n(Solartron 1260 Impedance Analyser). Dense samples for measurement were prepared \nby pressing into 13mm diameter pellets and firing for 2 hours at 1550-1650\u00baC. Pt \nelectrodes were then affixed to the pellets using Pt paste and the pellet fired again, at \n850\u00baC for 30 mins, to give good electrical contact between sample and electrode. \nTime of flight neutron diffraction data were recorded on diffractometer HRPD at the \nISIS facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. All structural refinements employed \nthe GSAS suite of Rietveld refinement software [40]. \nThe computational studies of the local distortions introduced by a Mg dopant on the \nLa and Si sites were performed using well established atomistic techniques, as \nembodied in the GULP code [41]. These methodologies are extensively documented \nelsewhere [42], so only a brief summary is given here. The calculations are based on \nthe Born model in which interactions between ions are evaluated in terms of long \nrange Coulombic terms and short-range interactions which take account of Pauli \nrepulsion and Van der Waals effects. To model these short-range interactions, the \nBuckingham potential was used: \n \n6\/)\/exp()( ijijijij rCrArV \u2212\u2212= \u03c1  (1) \n \nwhere r is the interatomic separation and A, \u03c1 and C are empirically derived \nparameters. A well established three-body term for the angle-dependant [SiO4] \n 7 \ntetrahedral unit was used [19,20]. Because charged defects will polarise other ions in \nthe lattice, it is important to include a good description of ionic polarisability in the \nmodel. The shell model was used in this work, which describes each ion in terms of a \nseparate core connected to a mass-less shell via a harmonic spring. \nAn important feature of these simulations is the treatment of lattice relaxation around \nthe dopant Mg2+ ion. The Mott-Littleton approach was employed, in which the crystal \nlattice is partitioned into two regions: the immediate environment surrounding the \ndefect is relaxed explicitly, whilst the remainder of the crystal, where the defect forces \nare relatively weak, is treated by more approximate quasi-continuum methods. In this \nway the local relaxation is effectively modelled and the crystal is not considered \nsimply as a rigid lattice. \nInteratomic potentials were transferred directly from our previous study of \nLa9.33Si6O26, which accurately reproduce the observed complex structure [19,20]. For \nthis work, calculations were based upon a 1x1x3 supercell (124 atoms) of the \nLa9.33Si6O26 crystallographic unit cell, with periodic boundary conditions applied to \ngenerate the full crystal. The La vacancies were placed on the La1\/La2 sites in \naccordance with previous experimental and simulation work, and the lattice was then \nallowed to relax to find the lowest energy configuration. This structural model was \nthen used for the local structure analysis on incorporation of Mg2+  dopant ions onto \nthe Si and La sites. \n \n \nResults  \n \n 8 \nX-ray powder diffraction showed that the four samples, La9.5Si5.75Mg0.25O26, \nLa9.67Si5.5Mg0.5O26, La9Mg0.5Si6O26, La9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26, were successfully \nprepared confirming that Mg is an ambi-site dopant, which can be substituted onto \nboth the La and the Si site. The bulk conductivity data  (table 1) shows that doping \nMg  onto the Si site results in an enhancement in conductivity of an order of \nmagnitude while doping onto the La site reduces the conductivity by a similar amount, \na result which accords well with previous reports [34,35,38]. The sample, \nLa9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26, doped on both sites displays a conductivity similar to \nundoped La9.33Si6O26 as the two effects counterbalance each other. . \n \nStructure determination \n \nInitial Rietveld analysis of the diffraction data focussed on the determination of the \nappropriate symmetry for the Mg doped systems. In accordance with previous studies \non apatite type materials, two space groups were examined: P63\/m, and P63, with the \nassignment being based on the residual R-factors.  For all four samples an improved \nfit was obtained by lowering the symmetry to P63. There was no evidence for any \nanisotropic peak broadening observed previously for Co doping on the Si site [32]. \nThe Mg occupancies of the La, Si site were fixed at the value expected from the \nstarting composition. In accordance with previous experimental observations, and \npredictions from modelling, the 6c La3 site was found to be fully occupied by La, \nwith La non-stoichiometry preferring the [1\/3,2\/3,z] La1\/La2 positions. The \noccupancies of these two sites were refined with the constraint that the final \nstoichiometry equalled the starting composition of the material. For the samples with \nMg on the La site, La9Mg0.5Si6O26, La9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26, the presence of both \n 9 \ncation vacancies and dopant complicates the location of the dopant. Therefore, in the \ninitial stages of the refinement, the Mg was distributed statistically over the La1\/La2 \nsites. An inspection of the bond distances showed a significant difference in the La2-\nO distances compared to samples without Mg doping on the La site. The bond length \nchanges were consistent with modelling predictions for Mg substituting on this site \n(see later) and therefore the results suggested that Mg preferentially occupies the La2 \nsite in La9Mg0.5Si6O26, La9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26. In the final refinement of these two \nsamples, therefore, the Mg was assumed to all be located on the La2 site. The number \nof cation vacancies on the La1\/La2 sites was then refined.   \nIn terms of the oxygen positions, the occupancy of the channel oxygen (O5) site was \ninitially varied. In all cases, the refined site occupancy dropped below 1.0 with a \nvalue lieing between 0.84-0.90. Along with this reduced site occupancy, the \nanisotropic thermal displacement parameter U33 for O5 in all samples were very high. \nThis suggested that there were significant displacements of the oxygens in the O5 site \ninto interstitial positions. Therefore a number of refinements were performed to try to \nfind the location of the remaining oxygens. Difference fourier maps suggested the \npresence of small levels of unfitted scattering along z close to the centre of the \nchannels, as well as at the periphery, close to the silicate groups, in positions similar \nto those reported by previous modelling and neutron diffraction studies. Attempts to \nrefine occupancy in these positions were, however, unsuccessful, which may be \nrelated to the resultant small occupancies of these sites. Therefore in the final \nrefinements, no interstitial sites were included and the occupancies of the O5 site were \nfixed at 1.0 in order to achieve electroneutrality. \nFinal refined structural data are given in table 2, with selected bond distances in table \n3. The neutron diffraction profiles are shown in figures 3-6. \n 10 \nTo supplement the neutron diffraction studies, the local bond length changes \naccompanying the Mg doping were determined from atomistic simulations. These \nlocal bond length changes are shown in table 4. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe calculated cell parameter data (table 2) were all in agreement with those expected \nfrom the dopant size. For example, doping Mg onto the La site (La9Mg0.5Si6O26) \nresults in a decrease in cell size compared to La9.33Si6O26 due to the smaller size of \nMg2+ compared to La3+. Similarly substitution on the Si site (La9.5Si5.75Mg0.25O26, \nLa9.67Si5.5Mg0.5O26) results in a significant increase in the cell size as Mg2+ is larger \nthan Si4+. The sample doped with Mg on both sites (La9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26) has cell \nparameters in between those of the single site doped samples La9Mg0.5Si6O26 and \nLa9.67Si5.5Mg0.5O26. \nAll four Mg doped samples were refined with space group P63. The lowering of \nsymmetry from P63\/m to P63 leads to a splitting of some of the crystallographic sites, \nand there was evidence for ordering of La vacancies\/Mg in the split La sites. In \nparticular Mg was shown to occupy the La2 (1\/3, 2\/3, \u22480.5) position in preference to \nLa1 (1\/3, 2\/3, \u22480.0). In addition the former site generally contained more cation \nvacancies than the latter.  For example in the case of the sample \nLa9.33Mg0.5Si5.5Mg0.5O26, the occupancy of the La1 site refined to 1.0 indicating no \nvacancies on this site, with all the vacancies correspondingly on the La2 site.  \nA comparison of the bond distances for the Mg doped samples shows that on doping \non the Si site an expansion of the tetrahedra is observed (table  3) in agreement with \n 11 \nthe larger size of Mg2+ compared to Si4+. Atomistic simulation studies indicate that \nMg doping results in a large local distortion, with the predicted Mg-O bond distances \nranging between 1.84 and 1.96 \u00c5 (table 4). This corresponds to an average 17 % \nexpansion in the tetrahedra.  \nIn the case of Mg doping on the La site, the observed data show that the La2-O bond \ndistances change significantly,  indicating that Mg substitutes preferentially on this \nsite. From the data it can be seen that six of the bonds (La2-O1, O2) shorten while \nthere is a lengthening of the remaining three (La2-O4). This has the effect of creating \nfurther distortion in the coordination of this site, such that the original distorted nine \ncoordination environment approaches six coordination, with the remaining three \nbonds being very long. The neutron diffraction results are in complete agreement with \natomistic simulation predictions, which show that the introduction of the small Mg2+ \ncation on the La site causes a large change in the bond distances (table 4) resulting in \nan effective 6 coordination for the Mg.  \nApart from the bond distance and cell parameter changes due to the dopant Mg, \nreported above, there are no other significant structural differences between the four \nsamples. In all four samples, very high thermal displacement parameters are observed \nfor the O5 channel oxygen site consistent with previous structural studies of apatite-\ntype rare earth silicates\/germinates [9, 21-23]. These thermal displacement parameters \nare highly anisotropic, with U33 (corresponding to the direction of the oxygen \nchannels) being particularly large. As noted in the structural determination section, \nthe freely refined occupancy of this site drops below 1.0. This coupled with the high \nthermal displacement parameters indicates significant displacement of oxygens into \ninterstitial sites. Difference fourier maps were investigated to locate the exact \npositions of the interstitial sites, and indicated small regions of unfitted scattering \n 12 \nalong the channels near to the channel centre, along with regions at the periphery of \nthe channels in positions similar to the favourable interstitial site predicted by our \nmodelling studies of La9.33Si6O26 [19,20], and subsequently reported in neutron \ndiffraction studies of La9.33+x(Si\/Ge)6O26+3x\/2 by Leon-Reina et al. [21-23]. However, \nattempts to refine occupancy in these sites were unsuccessful, which may be due to \nthe displaced oxygens being distributed over not just one, but a range of interstitial \nsites, leading to low occupancies for each site.  \nIn addition to the high thermal displacement parameters for the O5 site, the values for \nthe silicate tetrahedra oxygens (O1-O4) are also high, which are also consistent with \nprevious structural studies [9, 21-23]. It should be noted that the presence of Mg on \nthe Si site would be expected to produce an increase in these parameters due to the \nsignificantly longer Mg-O bond distances compared to Si-O, but nevertheless the \ndopant levels are relatively low and so the high thermal displacement parameters are \nunlikely to simply be correlated with the effect of the dopant. Moreover, high values \nare also observed for the sample without Si site doping. In terms of the other sites, the \nthermal parameters for the La1 site are also relatively high, which may be related to \nthe local distortions caused by neighbouring La vacancies and\/or Mg in the adjacent \nLa2 site. \nOverall the results suggest significant structural distortions in these Mg doped apatite-\ntype lanthanum silicates. However from the structural parameters derived from \nneutron diffraction, there is no clear indication why the samples doped with Mg on \nthe La site have significantly lower conductivities than the samples doped on the Si \nsite. This deficiency can be correlated with the fact that neutron diffraction only gives \nan average structure, and since the dopant levels are relatively low, the structural \nchanges observed are masked within this average structure. In order to determine the \n 13 \norigin of the conductivity differences, we therefore need to analyse the local structural \nchanges, and in this respect the atomistic simulation studies provide detailed results. \nThese atomistic simulation studies show the structural changes occurring in the \nvicinity of a dopant Mg2+ cation, whether it is on the La or the Si site.  \nThe modelled local environments for the undoped, Mg on Si site, and Mg on La2 site \nsystems are shown in figures 7-9. As outlined above, doping with Mg on the Si site \nleads to an expansion of the tetrahedra. In addition to affecting the tetrahedral site, \nsuch large changes also have a large affect on the surrounding sites (table 4, Figure 8). \nIn particular, it is seen that the La1\/La2-O distances to the oxygens of the MgO4 \ntetrahedra all shorten to a similar length (\u22482.4 \u00c5). In addition there is a change in the \ntilting of the tetrahedra (MgO4) with respect to the O5 channels as well as an increase \nin the average distance between the O5 site and O1,O3,O4 sites (average distance = \n3.82 \u00c5 (Mg on Si site) versus 3.56 \u00c5 (undoped)). The latter indicates that Mg doping \nfor Si leads to an expansion of the oxide ion channels, while the former results in \nmore of the O1-O3-O4 face showing to the channel. Since the predicted interstitial \noxide ion sites are at the periphery of the channels near the silicate tetrahedra, and \ntheir conduction pathway involves migration across the face of a silicate tetrahedral \nunit, then both the above local structural changes might account for the observed \nincrease in conductivity by enhancing the favourability of the interstitial oxide ion \ndefects as well as lowering their migration energy. In addition, the ability of Mg to \nexpand its coordination sphere might also enhance the conductivity for samples doped \nwith Mg on the Si site.   \nIn contrast to the beneficial effects of Mg doping on the Si site, the incorporation of a \nMg2+ dopant cation on the La site leads to a significant reduction in conductivity.   \nThe simulation data shows that the incorporation of Mg on the La2 site results in a \n 14 \nlarge change in the bond distances of this site (table 4, figure 9). In particular six of \nthe bonds (La2-O1,O2) shorten, while the remaining three (La2-O4) lengthen \nconsiderably. The overall effect is that the coordination of the site changes from a \ndistorted 9 coordinate environment to an effective 6 coordinate environment for Mg. \nThe effect of the large (0.45 \u00c5) expansion in the La2-O4 distance is to cause the O4 \nsite to encroach the oxide ion channels, as can be seen from the significant reduction \nin the O5-O4 distance (from 3.255 to 2.954 \u00c5). In addition this reduction in O5-O4 \ndistance results in a significant change in the tilting of the adjacent SiO4 tetrahedra, \nsuch that the oxide ion channels see less of the O1-O3-O4 face, as evidenced by the \nlarge differences in the O1-O5, O3-O5, O4-O5 distances, which vary between 2.95 \nand 4.13 \u00c5 (cf the much smaller variation for Mg doping on the Si site, 3.72-3.86 \u00c5).  \nBoth these structural changes might be expected to adversely affect the generation of \ninterstitial oxide ion defects as well as their migration, accounting for the reduction in \nconductivity.  \n \nConclusions \n \nMg has been successfully doped into the apatite-type lanthanum silicate, La9.33Si6O26, \nsubstituting onto either the La or Si site depending on the starting stoichiometry. In \nagreement with cation size expectations, an enlargement of the unit cell is observed \non Mg substitution for Si, with a contraction of the unit cell for Mg substitution on the \nLa site. For the latter, the neutron diffraction results indicate that there is ordering of \nMg on the La2 (1\/3, 2\/3, \u22480.5) site, with corresponding significant changes in the \nbond lengths for this site, consistent with predictions from atomistic simulation \nstudies that the coordination effectively reduces from a distorted nine coordination to \n 15 \nsix coordination. These atomistic simulation studies show that both doping strategies \ninfluence the oxide ion channels, with Mg doping on the Si site leading to a local \nexpansion of the channels, while doping on the La site results in a large displacement \nof the silicate O4 site, such that it encroaches the oxide ion channels. The observed \nlocal structural changes are therefore consistent with Mg doping on the Si site \nenhancing the conductivity, while La site doping reduces it. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank EPSRC for funding this work.
