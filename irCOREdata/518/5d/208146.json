Edith Turner, 1997.\nAn Interview with Edith Turner1\nmatthew engelke\nDepartment of Anthropology, 101 Brooks Hall,\nUniversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. 22903,\nU.S.A. 9 ii 00\nIntroduction: The following interview is taken from a\nmuch longer life history conducted over the course of\nseveral months in 1997 as a project sponsored in part by\nthe Historical Archives Program of the Wenner-Gren\nFoundation for Anthropological Research. The original\nmotivation for that project was to explore the life and\nwriting of Edith Turner, her marriage to Victor Turner,\nand how the dynamics of gender and marriage affect the\nproduction of anthropological work. This interview has\nbeen framed to touch briefly on the issues raised in the\nlonger work. In a few instances it has been necessary to\nwrite transitional paragraphs in order to give this inter-\nview a more coherent form, but an effort has been made\nto keep the tone, ideas, and progression of the original\nconversations intact.\nME: When did you and Victor Turner meet?\nET: In 1942, at Carfax in Oxford, which is the main cross-\nroads, right in the middle of Oxford. That\u2019s where Vic\nand I arranged to meet, an arrangement made by my\nbrother Charlie.\nME: Was it a blind date?\nET: It was through Charlie, but it didn\u2019t have the feeling\nof a blind date. Charlie had been at university in Oxford,\nand then he was drafted into the army, into the same\nunit as Vic. In this unit there was lots of lifted literary\ntalk and talk about politics. The unit consisted entirely\nof men who were conscientious objectors to the war.\nNevertheless, they were drafted and doing noncombatant\nwork of various kinds. My brother Charlie said, \u201cYou\nought to meet Vic,\u201d meaning something like \u201cMy God,\nhe\u2019s interesting. He\u2019s the most interesting guy in this\ngroup, and you should meet him.\u201d\nME: So it was out of an interest in conversation and\nliterature.\nET: Yes, that\u2019s right. It was so fascinating. But I don\u2019t\nthink we even thought of ourselves as being literary, you\n1. q 2000 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological\nResearch.

I was doing the same sort of reading\nat the gardens where I worked. I would read at lunch\nhour and get in trouble with my workmate for not talk-\ning to her. It was just a spontaneous thing. We weren\u2019t\nbeing literary or anthropological, or trying to find lovers,\nor anything like that.\nME: What were you reading?\nET: I had been reading Bernard Shaw and Henri Bergson.\nVic had been reading Kierkegaard, and he was also read-\ning the symbolist poets of France: Baudelaire, Rimbaud,\nVerlaine, and Marlarme\u00b4. I was reading stuff I used to get\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n844 F current anthropology\nout of the library. There was a whole series of Penguin\nbooks out, the \u201cNew Writing\u201d group of writers. We were\nreading those like mad, in addition to the new poets.\nThere was a conscious effort to keep poetry and the arts\ngoing in the war. In fact, a little later a group from Vic\u2019s\narmy unit was formed to publish our writing. It was\ncalled Oasis because we were an \u201coasis\u201d in the desert.\nWe regarded the war scene as a sort of great patriotic\ndesert.\nRimbaud called what he was doing \u201cthe reasoned de-\nregulation of all the senses.\u201d We didn\u2019t go that far, but\nwhat Rimbaud saw was the immense beauty of the world\nif you weren\u2019t hedged in by conventions. This is more\nor less what it was like for us. My mother-in-law later\ncalled me a bohemian.\nVic and I married in 1943, six months after we met.\nFor me, finding him was like the discovery of poetry. So\nit hadn\u2019t been a blind date but I fell in love anyway. And\nlater he said that after two weeks he knew I was the one.\nAfter the war Vic went back to University College, Lon-\ndon, to resume his studies where he had left off on being\ncalled up. But during the war we had discovered anthro-\npology through the books of Margaret Mead and A. R.\nRadcliffe-Brown, so after the war Vic changed his course\nfrom literature to anthropology, which was under Darryl\nForde at the time. We moved down to Hastings, south\nof London, to where Vic\u2019s mother, Violet, was living. He\nused to take the train into London for his seminars.\nVic used to read out all of his assignments to me while\nI was doing chores around the house, and so I was getting\na course under quite an interesting person who was a\nbudding professor himself. Though now I feel I\u2019d have\ngiven anything to have gone in and written papers my-\nself, I could not because I had three young kids on my\nhands. But at home it was one long seminar all the time,\nday and night. We were thinking of anthropology all the\ntime.\nAnd then, Vic came back from London University one\nday and said, \u201cI\u2019ve met Max Gluckman, and he wants\nme to put in for the Rhodes-Livingstone grant. He wants\nme to get my Ph.D. at Manchester.\u201d Vic was very en-\nthusiastic about this offer. Max was a bit of a Marxist\nand was interested in the Hegelian dialectic, which was\na new thing in anthropology. Any kind of idea which\ncould encompass change was new at the time, because\nBritish structuralism was the fashion. Max was an in-\nnovator, and Vic could see this. With all the political\nwork we\u2019d been doing, we thought it was a great chance\nto do research into the very heart of human society in\nAfrica. It looked just right.\nA lot of good things did indeed happen in Africa, and\na lot of them happened because Vic was the kind of per-\nson he was and just ate up hard work. Vic worked for a\nyear as a research assistant in Manchester, attending\nseminars, and I also audited seminars occasionally. Later\non in Manchester, Max would show his delight that he\u2019d\ngot Vic around.\nME: When you were preparing to go to Africa, how were\nyou feeling about your role in the whole trip?\nET: Vic\u2019s getting a grant and going to Africa and my\ngetting travel money to go, too, simply confirmed that\nwe would go on doing this collaboration. I knew I could\ndo fieldwork among the women, taking for granted I\nwould do so. I was extremely hopeful. It was a matter\nof not even wondering if I would fit in. I don\u2019t remember\nthere ever being any question or doubts or fears or any-\nthing like that. It was a matter of \u201cNow we have a chance\nto do our proper work.\u201d We knew how important field-\nwork was in anthropology, and, well, I had this marvel-\nous husband, so I wasn\u2019t nervous.\nME: What did you expect as a family and as anthropol-\nogists in this first trip to the field?\nET: I think we had the old fieldworker\u2019s guide, Notes\nand Queries [Royal Anthropological Institute 1957].\nYeah, we had that. Max [Gluckman] didn\u2019t run fieldwork\npreparation classes. In fact, I still don\u2019t think they do\nenough of that in anthropology.\nVic plunged into his research with vigor, at a tremen-\ndous rate, and grew familiar with the little enclave of\nvillages around the rest house where we stayed for the\nfirst three months. I made friends with a woman called\nFatima, who took me to rituals. I saw the girls\u2019 \u201cripening\nceremony,\u201d Nkang\u2019a. We saw the girl coming out danc-\ning. I was writing rapidly. I had a clipboard, and Vic had\na clipboard. We were at it as hard as we could, with no\ntape recorders. We just simply wrote down rapidly ev-\nerything that happened. And I was taking a lot of pho-\ntographs, being the main photographer. At night we\nwould write up the fieldnotes. Sometimes I typed out\nVic\u2019s fieldnotes for him. Sometimes we just collated nu-\nmerical material of various kinds.\nME: In The Spirit and the Drum [1987], you write about\nyour research assistant, cook, and friend Musona\/Ka-\nsonda a lot. He also appears in some of Vic\u2019s early work,\nespecially Schism and Continuity [1957]. Did he always\ntravel with you?\nET: Yes, he did. He regarded it as his \u201clabor migration.\u201d\nWe never really went that far from Mukanza [his home\nvillage], and we kept on going back there because it was\na center of ritual activity. Musona brought his three\nwives and children with him wherever we were.\nME: Did you talk to the women more than the men?\nET: Yes, on the whole, although there wasn\u2019t a lot of sex\nsegregation. I often used to go to the gardens, and we\u2019d\ntalk there. I used to ask the women what it was like to\nbe in a polygamous marriage. The first wives would say,\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, it\u2019s a good life.\u201d And the second and third\nwives said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a good life. More or less we\ndon\u2019t get much of a look-in.\u201d And the young third wives,\nwho were usually kankang\u2019a [having just gone through\nthe puberty ritual], would be married off to wealthy older\nmen whether they liked it or not. In one case there was\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 845\na man about 50 or 60 years old whose young wife ran\naway. I thought that she ran away because she found him\ndisgusting, but she ran away, you see, because he\ncouldn\u2019t get it up! And I liked to hear that, because these\ngirls were really glowing with sexuality. They were su-\nperb young women. That was where I caught on to the\nmarvelous sexuality of African life. The Ndembu loved\nsex. The most pleasant and cheerful conversations were\nabout sex, and their only fears were of witches who were\n\u201chot\u201d in their sex lives\u2014too fast and sudden. The women\nliked it chovu, which means gently and quietly. They\nliked sex to come up gently. Boy, they loved it.\nME: How did having children in the field influence the\ndynamics between you and the Ndembu?\nET: What do you think, for heaven\u2019s sake?\nME: Well, I would think it would make things a lot\neasier.\nET: Yes, of course! Obviously! Freddie, Bobbie, and Rene\nall got along with the Ndembu children. Freddie and\nBobbie would run off in the afternoon with their\ngangs\u2014hunting for little animals or just playing around.\nWe would spend each morning on lessons from a cor-\nrespondence course that I sent away for in Salisbury, but\nthese lessons always seemed to get sidetracked. For Vic\nand me, having our children made us more human in\nthe eyes of the adults.\nME: So what was the Rhodes-Livingstone plan of study?\nET: One year in the field and one year back for finding\nout what you don\u2019t know, then one year in the field again\nto fill in what you don\u2019t know, and then one year for\nwrite-up.\nME: I\u2019m curious to know what you were reading at the\ntime and what types of issues from the first field trip\nstuck out for you and Vic as needing more exploration\nduring the second.\nET: Well, we were reading a lot of Meyer Fortes. This\nwas the big thing then. Vic was also reading Marcel\nGriaule around that time. We were interested in what\nthe French were doing, but Vic was very critical because\nthey didn\u2019t have a sense of social interactions and social\ncontexts that the British always had. And he was then,\nas always, very proud of what the British were doing. He\nthought French anthropology was superficial because it\nwas not alive in human interaction, and that is what Vic\nwas talking about. His version of political anthropology\nwas local-level politics and the actual political rivalries,\nlike those he was to write up later in Schism and Con-\ntinuity. We were also both reading Henri Junod, and I\nwas very fond of his work.\nWe were encouraged by conversations with Max in the\nManchester interim. There were several rituals going on\nwhen we got back [to Mwinilunga], and Vic was then\nfully able to put them in the proper setting of kinship\nand political rivalries. As I said, Meyer Fortes\u2019s work was\nvery useful to us because we realized that those concerns\noverlap each other and influence each other, just as\nMeyer had shown among the Tallensi. But we felt this\nwas even more so among the Ndembu, because the con-\ncerns weren\u2019t only kinship and clanship; they consisted\nof local political rivalries and illnesses and curative cults\nand the new influences from the British government and\nthe march of colonial development\u2014all kinds of forces\nwere playing there, doing their work, creating a present,\nthe now.\nSo we went into the field again, and this time we ar-\nranged to stay in Mukanza [Kajima] village for the whole\nperiod because it was at the crossroads of many different\ninfluences.\nThis was when our trips out to the Mukanda ritual,\nthe boys\u2019 initiation involving circumcision, started. It\nbecame clear that these rituals were performed by people\nwho had complex motivations and rivalries and conflicts\n[see \u201cMukanda: Rites of Circumcision\u201d in The Forest of\nSymbols (V. Turner 1967)]. Certain people had more\npower because they were earning money building a new\nroad, and others were the old-fashioned type. In the end\nit was one of the old-fashioned type, Nyaluhana, who\ndid the circumcising. He just took it over and pushed by\neveryone else as they laid the boys out; he was there\nwith his knife and did the cutting. They had to hold down\nthe boys because they were only six or seven years old,\nsome of them, and they just wouldn\u2019t stay still. So the\nmen played drums loudly to drown out the crying.\nRituals quickly became the focal point of all that we\ndid. I remember that at the beginning of a twin ceremony\nonce, my friend Nylakusa came out of her hut yelling\ncheerfully, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d I can see her now. Ritual is fun,\nand her shout captured something. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s\nthe matter with us anthropologists. For instance, as Vic\nanalyzed the twin ceremony in his writing, it was schol-\narly and showed the detail of the symbolism. I myself\nwould like to have described the ritual in a different way;\nto have shown something of the swing of the whole thing\nas a kind of a great event. I\u2019m interested in capturing\nwhat that woman felt when she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d You\nknow? And that\u2019s what I feel is missing in anthropology.\nMany people have felt it incumbent upon them to write\nwith deadly seriousness. It must be said that Vic was\nneeding to write a foolproof Ph.D., because he had a wife\nand three children to support. The blame falls squarely\non the coldness of academic demand.\nSpending a whole year and a quarter in Mukanza vil-\nlage was just the right thing to do. It was tempting to\nus to go from place to place as we had done in the first\ntour, but the richness of the material was there in Mu-\nkanza\u2014the intimate knowledge of personalities, people,\nthe friendships. These were of the essence in this kind\nof fieldwork. Other disciplines regard much of anthro-\npology as a string of anecdotes and don\u2019t think highly of\nit, because they value statistics and think such results\nare the truth, produced according to the real scientific\nmethod. But when you\u2019re staying in a village like Mu-\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n846 F current anthropology\nkanza for a length of time, getting to know an intimate\nlittle place, even though it\u2019s only a tiny spot on the map\nof Africa, somehow or other you get in-depth documen-\ntation and understanding. Human sympathy with what\u2019s\n\u201con the ground\u201d is what the anthropologist is talking\nabout. The stuff of life is difficult to bring into relation\nwith a comprehension of the whole human scene, but I\nthink we have to do it.\nWhen Vic went back to Manchester University with\nthese cases, with the Kamahasanyi Ihamba case, and so\non, Max Gluckman said, \u201cDon\u2019t do the ritual first. Do\nthe social structure and make that your dissertation.\u201d\nVic was, for better or for worse, linked irrevocably with\nManchester for his Ph.D., so he wrote Schism and Con-\ntinuity, which is in great part the statistical picture of a\nmatrilineal people, including plentiful case material and\na discussion of the implications of marriage locality. Max\nhad thus set Vic an exercise in describing a social system\nas a preliminary to his writing on ritual.\nSo we built up these statistics. But there was an oc-\ncasion in a pub in North Manchester, which I\u2019ve dis-\ncussed in the introduction to On the Edge of the Bush\n[V. Turner 1985], about the social drama. Vic was in the\npub with Bill Epstein wondering what it was about an-\necdotes, episodes, and trouble cases that was so impor-\ntant. There was \u201cprocess\u201d going on here, and not just\n\u201csocial process\u201d but a special form of \u201critual process.\u201d\nWe had been thinking about what happened in the sec-\nond field trip, when Sandombu\/Samutamba had terrible\nrows in the village when he was drunk, blaming his wife\nfor not having any children and his mother-in-law for\nbeing a witch. Sandombu would roar out the frightful\nwords \u201cWanza weyi!\u201d(Dirt under your foreskin!). He was\nfurious, and this was a real curse. That scene and the\nquarrels that followed and the trouble that came up in\nepisode after episode, as documented in Schism and Con-\ntinuity, meant that the very roots, the vital existence of\nthe village was trembling and tottering all the time. This\nwas in front of our eyes during the second session in the\nfield. Vic couldn\u2019t look at these events as just anecdotes\nor mere trouble cases. He strung them together later in\nSchism and Continuity, but while still in the field he\nwas taking notes, massive notes, paying attention be-\ncause of this hunch which he hadn\u2019t yet articulated\u2014not\nuntil the pub in Manchester with Bill Epstein. The hunch\nin Manchester was the concept of the social drama and\nits definable form: breach, crisis, redress, and reconcili-\nation. After the pub conversation, Vic wrote it all down\nand turned it in to Max as the major chapter in his dis-\nsertation. And Max liked it.\nThere are other stories important to that early work.\nOnce during the second field period we were walking\nover an old village site, a bit north of Mukanza village,\njust taking a walk. The old village site had ghosts because\npeople had died in those huts. You would hear voices,\nand they were talking about you, and they would tell\nyou not to eat the bananas. As Vic and I were walking\nover this place we were talking, and we came on to the\nsubject of Sigmund Freud, whose work had become very\nimportant to us in the field. Vic had got hold of The\nInterpretation of Dreams [Freud 1955] in the field, and\nit all came out in 3-D for him. During that walk I, too,\nsaw the curious imagery in dreams as echoing every-\nwhere in Ndembu consciousness. We were both excited.\nDecades later I experienced dreams, as Native Americans\ndo, as truly prophetic. This time, however, the ghosts\ndecided Freud should rule! The Interpretation of Dreams\npowered Vic\u2019s work on symbolic analysis and was a real\nbreakthrough in the field itself. So this all came out at\nthat time and we discussed it night and day, and it was\nmarvelous for us. I loved it.\nWhen we returned from the field, we had to get to\nbusiness and write, get this dissertation through. We\nreckoned it was from the September term to the spring\nthat Vic would have to do the work, while the grant\nlasted. We had all these figures to deal with and recheck\nand we also had to consider which tables would be use-\nful, perhaps introduce some other ones, too. Vic was deal-\ning with the field notes and the main series of cases, the\nsocial dramas. We were busy in our rented house in\nNorth Manchester, going in to the department very of-\nten, and because the children were in school it was pos-\nsible for me to take part.\nWonderful seminars were being held, and we had li-\nbrary research to do. But we did a great deal of work at\nhome. Vic kept all his main materials and his typewriter\nand books at home; he didn\u2019t have an office at the uni-\nversity. And we began to build up the dissertation, chap-\nter by chapter, very carefully, starting with the geogra-\nphy, means of subsistence, political systems and history,\netc. Nowadays, I discourage students who want to do\ntheir write-up that way. I tell them to start with some-\nthing which is at the heart of the topic, which begins to\nbreathe real life into the piece. But those were the days\nwhen the old conventions still reigned, and you simply\ndid it this way. Vic handled the main writing. There was\nonly one typewriter. I did the editing throughout, and\nthe tables and the photographs, working all the time.\nMax Gluckman, when he finally got a complete draft in\nhis hand, with great painstaking care went through every\nword of it, copyediting in detail.\nI liked this work a lot because we used to talk about\nthe subject matter all the time. I did the maps for Vic.\nThese details are important to know, but they don\u2019t get\nvery much regarded. Vic\u2019s mother came up when Vic got\nhis dissertation, and it was quite an occasion. I was im-\nmensely proud, and I bought myself a new hat.\nME: Is there any part of Schism and Continuity that you\nand Vic kept coming back to as something to argue over,\nagree on, or revel in?\nET: Yeah, the social dramas were all of those. They were\nthe great events in the villages that affected us all. And\nwe wrote it all down and took great pains to record them\nall in photographs in the dissertation. And yet I felt there\nwas no sense that there was a spirit being passed down\nin the book, but Vic said there was, because of the Chi-\nhamba ritual given at the end. I regarded that analysis\nof Chihamba as being tailored to fit the theme of the\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 847\nbook as a whole\u2014emphasizing the unifying effect of the\ncult of Chihamba throughout that vicinage. It\u2019s too so-\nciological, although there are hints in the analysis that\nthere\u2019s more to Chihamba than what\u2019s written and it did\nlead on to Chihamba, the White Spirit [V. Turner 1962].\nSo OK, there were these differences of opinion. What I\nwas pleased about was the fact that in Schism you could\nsee the Ndembu ritual system in action. It was set \u201cin\ntime.\u201d And then of course there was my manuscript \u201cKa-\njima.\u201d I was writing myself while doing all this disser-\ntation work with Vic, because I couldn\u2019t not do it. Africa\nhad such an effect on me, and I missed the people so\nmuch. I had a vivid dream about them, and I just simply\nhad to get the events down the way I personally saw\nthem and experienced them.\nME: The manuscript \u201cKajima\u201d has always fascinated me.\nIt was eventually to become The Spirit and the Drum,\nsome 30 years after it was originally written. But I\u2019ve\nalways wondered about how you thought of it when you\nwrote it. Did you think of it as anthropology? How did\nyou and Vic talk about it?\nET: He was supportive about my doing this, but it wasn\u2019t\na part of the department\u2019s research. I never read any of\nit in the department; it was private writing. I didn\u2019t ex-\npect that anything I wrote would be given in the\nseminars.\nME: Why?\nET: Because no wives ever did this, unless they were\nuniversity-trained. And that was that. Otherwise you\nwere just going to be a bother. As one professor at [the\nUniversity of] Chicago later said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want all\nthese Hyde Park housewives around here.\u201d Thanks, you\nknow? I\u2019m very angry still. Such a dictum was taken for\ngranted in England at that time, and probably universally.\nI did go and sit in on the seminars, but the possibility\nof my contributing simply didn\u2019t come up. But Man-\nchester was a comfortable atmosphere, and so much\nwent on outside of the seminar setting. Elizabeth Colson\nused to do her knitting at the seminars. It was very hu-\nman, and I was extremely glad to be there at all.\nThe manuscript stayed in a drawer, and we were busy\nthinking out what was going to come next. In the late\n1950s, a very important thing happened in our lives: we\njoined the Catholic Church. It was at St. Joseph\u2019s, in\nManchester. We had been knocking around in Man-\nchester for a few years after the field, a little depressed\nfor a number of reasons. The Communist party, which\nwe had joined after the war in Hastings and which in-\nformed a good deal of our first fieldwork, had lost all\nappeal. African ritual had taken its place, and I suppose\nthat for us there was something of this ritual fever in\nthe Catholic Church. It would be hard to fully ex-\nplain\u2014or understand\u2014the reaction we got in the Man-\nchester department. A lot of our friends were card-car-\nrying members of the CP, and almost everyone in\nanthropology was a left-leaning atheist. Joining the Cath-\nolic Church was probably the worst thing we could have\ndone. It didn\u2019t end friendships, but it did cause tensions\nwith some people. In any case, we wanted to get out. Vic\nwas very devoted to Max but also wanted to get out from\nunder his thumb, so in 1960 he accepted an offer from\nthe Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sci-\nences at Stanford to spend a year there. Soon after that,\nhe got an offer from Cornell University to come as a full\nprofessor, which was very rare\u2014especially given his age.\nSo in 1964 we moved to Ithaca, and Vic started teaching\nat Cornell.\nME: It seems that when Vic was at Cornell your research\ninterests began to expand. I\u2019m thinking here of the Mor-\ngan Lectures Vic gave at Rochester during that time.\nET: The Ritual Process [V. Turner 1969], which was based\non those lectures, was the key to the Cornell period. It\nwas partly a recognition of the developing hippie era and\nof the demonstrations and love-ins at Cornell. We had\ntransferred the pub discussions of Manchester with the\nlikes of Bill Epstein to Cornell, although it was in our\nhouse rather than a pub. We developed a liminal system\nin our seminars. Somebody gave a presentation\u2014this\nwas the structured part. Then the interval, the liminal\ntime, when we all got cans of beer and had a break. Then\nwe came together afterwards for the \u201creaggregation,\u201d to\nsay more on what we\u2019d been talking about in the beer\ninterval. We would have a discussion and people would\nbe able to hear each other. That system worked like a\ntreat. At least 12 heads of departments have resulted\nfrom those seminars, and students with many, many\npublications\u2014I can\u2019t count the number of books that\nhave been written by students who have been to those\nseminars.\nWithin a short time the Chicago offer turned up. That\nappointment was for the Committee on Social Thought,\nwith a joint appointment in anthropology, but Vic was\nto be paid by the Committee. Without much hesitation\nhe said yes, because he liked some of the faculty a lot.\nHe was also interested in the liberty that the Committee\nmight offer, because he could teach outside of anthro-\npology\u2014courses on Dante and Blake or whatever caught\nhis fancy. We had been at Cornell four years and felt that\nwe could move on. We didn\u2019t necessarily want the beauty\nof nature and the quiet life that Ithaca offered. We wanted\nto be where the action was.\nAt the time, Vic\u2019s reputation was rising. He and I were\nproducing a lot of work. These books were popping out\nlike mad, and people were reading his papers in different\ncollections. Maybe if Chicago had been like the Virginia\ndepartment\u2014if it had had the same ethos\u2014it would have\nbeen a permanent affair for us. But there was something\nabout the University of Chicago\u2014a kind of tough, bitter\nsteel from the city itself that had gotten into the fabric\nof the school.\nThe first impressions in Chicago were of Hyde Park\nitself. When we first arrived the place was in an absolute\nuproar because of the 1968 elections and what was hap-\npening at the Democratic Convention. The police were\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n848 F current anthropology\nso jittery, I thought, my Lord, this place is very upset.\nVery, very upset. Vic and I felt for the students a lot. We\nwanted to be identified with them. Most of the faculty\nat Chicago didn\u2019t feel this way, and there were some ugly\nrows. But I always thought that the students were like\nyour children, and how could you betray your children?\nAnyway, this is part of what we plunged into when we\nfirst reached Chicago. I know these events played a big\nrole in how we thought about our work in anthropology\nfrom then on.\nME: Did you two carry the seminar format developed at\nCornell on to Chicago?\nET: Yeah. That seminar went on. It was known as \u201cVictor\nTurner\u2019s midnight seminar.\u201d It would start at eight\no\u2019clock on Thursdays and just go on and on. The gath-\nering just couldn\u2019t stop. Vic and I would wake up late\non Friday, about nine or ten, and go along to Walgreen\u2019s\nand have some coffee and sweet rolls. And Vera, the wait-\nress, would always come to our table, and we\u2019d feel to-\ntally at peace. We would walk around the Point, out near\nthe Lake Michigan, and then come and have our coffee,\ntalking about what had been going on in the seminar.\nThose were great days. It was the students who helped\nus think through everything.\nThe seminars were the heart of that Chicago period,\nbut Vic also gave courses to students who were interested\nin Durkheim. He gave lectures on Kierkegaard, William\nBlake, Dante, and other figures. He was able to do this\nin the Committee on Social Thought, you see, and he\nrelished it because at University College, London, he had\ngone deeply into literature. Besides, he and I were con-\ntinually exploring literature, the various Greek poets, the\nFrench symbolists, the American visionary romantics,\nand so on. It was a very busy time in Chicago, nine years\nin all.\nME: Did faculty come to the seminars at your house as\nwell?\nET: Some faculty, yes. I wouldn\u2019t say a lot. Maybe they\nwere there more than I realized. Fred Eggan was often\nthere. Not many anthropology faculty. Jamie Redfield\nwas there sometimes. Who else? If there were South\nAsian themes, it would be A. K. Ramanujan and Ralph\nNicholas turning up, depending on the topic on which\na student was presenting. The only regular was Fred\nEggan.\nME: At this point I wonder if we can talk about when\nyou started to work on the journal Primavera. I\u2019m also\ninterested in hearing about your experience of the\nwomen\u2019s movement and how feminist sentiments were\ncoming into the university.\nET: At the time I was more caught up in it than in any-\nthing else. I hadn\u2019t been totally aware of feminist issues.\nWhen I was a little kid I was kind of a feminist, but I\ndidn\u2019t attach myself to it because I was so busy with\nVic\u2019s work and his thinking. Primavera was actually\npointed out to me by Vic in The Maroon, the university\u2019s\nstudent newspaper. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s this ad calling for\npeople to work on a literary journal, why don\u2019t you do\nit?\u201d It was his suggestion that legitimized it for me. I\nwould have loved to do it anyway, but since it was com-\ning from him that meant, \u201cOK, that\u2019s a go-ahead.\u201d\nThere were more than a dozen of us working on this\njournal. Some of us were associated with the university\nand some weren\u2019t. We published poetry and articles. I\nwrote \u201cGirl into Woman\u201d for one issue, which was the\nfirst thing I published on the N\u2019kanga ritual. I liked work-\ning in a literary style very much. I worked hard on Pri-\nmavera, to such an extent that Vic started to feel he\nwasn\u2019t seeing much of me. But the journal work contin-\nued right until we left Chicago. We had a break for one\nyear in Princeton when Vic was at the Institute for Ad-\nvanced Study. He was there during the 1975\u201376 school\nyear and then back in Chicago until 1977.\nME: I wonder about the progression of all this. You were\nwriting a lot in the 1940s, and we\u2019ve talked about the\nwork in Oasis. And then in the 1950s, after the field,\nyou were writing both with Vic and on your own. In the\n1960s, when you got to America, you mention editing\nmore than writing, and then, in the 1970s, with this\nliterary journal, writing comes up again. How do you see\nthis history? Were you always thinking as a writer?\nET: On and off, yes. I can see the uneven development\nin any writer\u2019s life. And incidentally, about the Oasis\npoetry: I much admired Vic, who was writing very pre-\ncise poetry. It was almost as if every line came out in\nbalance, and I liked that. Of course that was one of the\nreasons I fell for him. But I tended to regard my own\nwriting as this kind of flyaway stuff. I admire Walt Whit-\nman because he has a free style. And I felt that probably\nmine was not gifted poetry because others had said it\nwas sort of wild. But the works of the hippie poets ac-\ntually encouraged me a lot; Alan Ginsberg, Gary Snyder,\nand the others. Ginsberg just let it all hang out, and that\nwas encouraging for me.\nME: This was also the time that you and Vic started\ngetting into the pilgrimage work, which resulted in your\nfirst officially coauthored book, Image and Pilgrimage\nin Christian Culture [1978]. That work strikes me as\nbeing of a very different nature from the Ndembu work\nand more a continuation of the later chapters in The\nRitual Process. How did you do the work for that project?\nET: It was different from standing with a clipboard in\nthe middle of the bush writing about medicines and rit-\nual. For the pilgrimage work we did do \u201ctraditional field-\nwork\u201d in the sense that we went on pilgrimages our-\nselves, but a lot of it was textual analysis. We looked a\nlot at writing by devotees, which was an important part\nof the project. And then of course the experience of going\non the pilgrimages as Catholics was personal as well as\nobservational. We were worshipping at the shrines; this\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 849\ndid not get into the writing very much, but it did creep\nin a bit here and there. So, we used more historical ma-\nterial and less straight ethnographic material about what\nthe pilgrims said to us. In hindsight, I feel we didn\u2019t have\nenough time to do any consistent following-up of specific\ngroups of pilgrims. That\u2019s why I went back to the field\nin Zambia after Vic died, because I\u2019d been missing that\nsort of thing\u2014integration with what the people were ac-\ntually doing.\nME: Looking back on the course of your work together\nand trying to situate the different projects, how do you\nthink about the question of authorship?\nET: There\u2019s not much difference\u2014is there?\u2014in what we\ndid together. It was just a matter of the political climate\nof the age. In the 1970s you could begin to say, \u201cOK, this\nwas a collaborative effort,\u201d but it was about the same\nbefore. For example in The Drums of Affliction [1968],\nVic had a big chapter on the girls\u2019 initiation, Nkang\u2019a. A\nlarge amount of that was my material, and the ideas were\nfrom our collaboration, but it was a book by Victor\nTurner, published by Clarendon Press. So it\u2019s a matter\nof the politics of the time. The fact that feminists in the\n1970s could raise these issues is very important, and I\ndo thank them. To a certain extent I wish there were\nmore of my stuff in the work, but then, in a way, there\nis, indirectly. But, you know, it\u2019s actually hard to col-\nlaborate in writing. It requires you to slow, and we were\nboth in full-tilt with what we were doing, you know?\nWe liked it that way, and we liked the fast pace.\nME: You\u2019ve mentioned to me before that when you two\nwent on your pilgrimage research trips, you started to\nwrite fieldnotes in your own style, which was different\nfrom how you approached fieldnotes with the Ndembu.\nI wonder if you can talk a little more about the process\nof writing fieldnotes\u2014from the early days with the\nNdembu to your latest work in Alaska [1996] and in\nIreland.\nET: In Mwinilunga, my fieldnotes were not as academic\nas Vic\u2019s, but they were running accounts of what people\ndid as I watched rituals. I did not give any emotional\nreactions of my own at all. I tried to get the account\nobjectively, but my emotional reactions were running\nthrough my head, and that\u2019s why I wrote \u201cKajima\u201d [The\nSpirit and the Drum]. I wanted to get it before the feel-\nings disappeared. I didn\u2019t regard that as academic; I re-\ngarded it as a narrative account that I wanted to do be-\ncause I liked doing it. So, OK, I was writing what\nhappened as a report of various rituals and so on, and I\nalways reckoned that they probably weren\u2019t as complete\nas Vic\u2019s and that he would be aware of social processes\ngoing on that I wouldn\u2019t because of his training. He had\na good eye for antagonisms in the village and the curious\ntangle of personalities that he wrote about in Schism and\nContinuity. I wasn\u2019t up to writing on the intricacies, or\nso I thought at the time. And so, OK, I wrote these\nreports.\nME: Did you think of yourself as an anthropologist in\nAfrica?\nET: I felt that I was a junior anthropologist, yes, but a\nstrange one because I hadn\u2019t been shaped in the mill at\nUniversity College. I was freewheeling a bit. My think-\ning wasn\u2019t shaped in the professional way, although I had\nbeen fairly close to it. And believe me, I had a deep re-\nspect for it, or else I wouldn\u2019t have helped Vic with all\nthose books. I was a sort of an anthropologist, and an\nanthropologist\u2019s assistant 100 percent.\nME: When you moved to Virginia in 1977 for Vic to take\nup the Kenan Professorship in anthropology and religious\nstudies, you delved even further into the realm of lit-\nerature by enrolling in English and creative writing\ncourses. I imagine this all fits into the trajectory you\u2019re\ndescribing.\nET: I found myself in this new place, and I was getting\nmore and more interested in writing. I felt I could do a\ndegree, and since there are extraordinary writers in Char-\nlottesville, people like John Casey and Greg Orr, and\nothers visiting, I felt I could take some courses in English\nand the symbolist literature. I was hoping and thinking\nthat maybe one day I would learn how to write what\nwas going to be The Spirit and the Drum, you see. I\nwanted to do it right. Eventually, when I did take courses,\nJohn Casey helped me a lot. He looked at that manu-\nscript, once I had done quite a bit more to it, and he gave\nme a great deal of help.\nI eventually decided to enroll full-time at the Univer-\nsity of Virginia, in English. I was accepted to the M.A.\nprogram, despite the fact that I had never earned a Bach-\nelor\u2019s degree. There was a question of whether I should\ndo it in anthropology or in English. Of course, Vic and I\nhad been writing poetry and reading great literature,\nwhich is a kind of passion in our family. I felt that I did\nnot want to learn what Vic had been teaching me all the\ntime and take classes on what was prevalent then, which\nwas solid structuralism. I felt that if I did, there would\nbe something slightly invidious about it, like nepotism\nor something. My hesitation was mainly because I had\nbeen living in the element of anthropology all the time,\nand I had my own rather strong ideas about it\u2014about\nliminality not being subsumed under structure.\nME: How did it feel being in school at 60?\nET: Oh, fine. I could cope much better than most of those\ngraduate kids because I had been with Vic doing a lot of\nwriting. I was more mature. And they were trying, I felt,\nto get the grades with more or less the least trouble they\ncould. I guess it was a little strange to be in school be-\ncause I was older than the others, but as you get older\nyou find things less strange anyway, you know. And I\nfelt capable and experienced. One of the professors gave\nus Henry Miller to study\u2014you know, Tropic of Capricorn\n[1965], real way-out stuff\u2014and I did the best of all on\nthat.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n850 F current anthropology\nME: And the administration didn\u2019t mind your not having\nbeen to college?\nET: Well, they counted my being a coeditor of Primavera\nas pretty important. They also saw other pieces I had\nwritten, and there was a very liberal attitude toward\nwomen at that time and women that came into studies\nlater in life. And they knew I had done the editing of\nVic\u2019s books and that I had been collaborating with Vic\nall this time.\nME: Did you ever think about a Ph.D.?\nET: Yes, obviously, but I was very involved in Vic\u2019s work\nso it didn\u2019t seem possible. Of course, I remember the\noccasion when the possibility came up, and in a way I\nregret it, and yet I knew that I couldn\u2019t.\nAfter Vic died in 1983 I was appointed a lecturer in\nthe anthropology department at UVA, which was appro-\npriate, I think. It was only part-time, and I immediately\nhad a lot more on my plate\u2014it was as if a great deal of\nwhat Vic was doing was suddenly put on my plate\u2014so\nthe part-time lectureship gave me time to deal with all\nthis.\nME: Many of your former students have told me about\nthe \u201cperformance\u201d seminars at Virginia that you and Vic\nled, which is also something I want to touch on because\nit seems as if the move to performativity was carried out\nmost thoroughly at Virginia.\nET: We were trying to convey an understanding of ritual\nin a way that reading and writing can\u2019t capture. This was\nsomething that Vic always talked about in his\nwork\u2014that a lot of ritual couldn\u2019t be put into words.\nWe\u2019d try to get the students in the spirit of it, and they\nvery quickly couldn\u2019t resist. There were strategies to fa-\ncilitate this. In these settings, you\u2019re not getting the\nstructural relationships\u2014\u201chot and cold,\u201d or whatever it\nis. You have those as well, but you get a sense of the\nprogression, the process, the body. And one has to \u201csus-\npend disbelief,\u201d as old Wordsworth said, and flow with\nit. Flow is so important\u2014the actual pacing and sense of\nbeing right in the thick of things. You can understand\nthrough the nonverbal. And when people go to the field,\nhaving done anthropology without having tried any per-\nformance, they see people fooling around and they don\u2019t\nknow what the hell they\u2019re at. They write it down and\nget the structural relationships, but they remain on the\noutside, because they would have to drop that criticality\nto understand. If you go in the field and you haven\u2019t\nperformed ritual before, and you see \u201cthe natives\u201d acting\nlike that, you look for signs of the social construction\nof reality and you find them, because you find what\nyou\u2019re looking for. There are always people running the\ntemple and doing accounts, so to speak. There are always\npeople at pilgrimage centers selling zillions of blue plas-\ntic virgins, plastic bottles with \u201cKnock Shrine\u201d printed\non them, and so on. So then you have your social con-\nstruction of reality and its workings and all, but that\nisn\u2019t much, and it isn\u2019t always interesting.\nME: This makes a lot of anthropologists uncomfortable.\nET: Oh, yeah. It used to make me uncomfortable.\nME: When was the switch for you?\nET: Well, after we joined the Catholic Church. You see,\nthere are various ways in which Vic wrote. Very hard-\nheaded, but then sometimes\u2014what\u2019s the word?\n\u2014experiential, and with an infinite respect for what was\ngoing on. Such is the way he wrote in Chihamba, the\nWhite Spirit. And in not a very different era he wrote\nThe Drums of Affliction, in which he practically ana-\nlyzed away the true meaning of the Ihamba ritual. These\ntwo things were going on side by side. I was usually in\nthe same mode as he. I often saw him responding in this\ndouble way to the anthropological material. To forestall\nthe critiques of this, he took a great deal of trouble with\nscholarship. This is what has kept the discipline in deep\nrespect of Vic\u2019s work. I know I\u2019m not the scholar that\nVic was, but still, I\u2019m perhaps even more of a maverick\nthan he. I don\u2019t give much of a damn, perhaps acting like\nthe naughty one of the family.\nME: That\u2019s your favorite role, I think.\nET: Oh, yes, you\u2019ve got it.\nME: All of this brings us to some key themes in anthro-\npology. Do you go native?\nET: As much as I bloody well can! To me that\u2019s the point.\nThere is a slight limitation, but human beings are ex-\ntraordinarily pervious to each other. As Vic said, there\nare these prepositional plugs in everybody\u2014to, for, from,\nagainst, by, with, of, within, out. Everyone has these\nplugs, and they plug into other people.\nI\u2019m a woman. In a bygone era, the man took the ini-\ntiative, and the woman would be trying to work along\nwith the man. I knew this from the environment I was\nin, and I had quite a lot of practice in it. A part of me\nwould say, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m going to be flexible and take on\nother people\u2019s views\u2014a husband\u2019s or whatever\u2014I\u2019ll take\non a lot of other people\u2019s views. What the hell is the\ndifference?\u201d This is something of the way my mind ar-\ngued. I went the way of Vic being a Catholic. He got the\nsense of it first and I did afterwards, although when I\nwas given the original sense it was very strong to me.\nSo in whatever we did, I delighted in getting alongside\nothers with their agenda. And \u201cgetting\u201d it, if I could.\nME: That\u2019s an interesting connection, I think, and an\ninteresting crossover between the personal and the pro-\nfessional. Can you say more about how you approached\nthe idea of a relationship with Vic in that sense? My\nsense is that it was a very complicated mix. You and I\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 851\nhave talked a lot about how you contributed to Vic\u2019s\nwork and how it was very much a collaborative effort.\nAnd everyone I\u2019ve talked to who knew you both has said\nthe same thing, without fail. And certainly the two of\nyou had profound impacts upon one another about how\nyou wrote things up. It\u2019s this very complicated mix of\ngive-and-take. There are moments when I think you as-\nsert your position within this all and make a point of\nclaiming that partnership and a very active role. I think\nthis is important and an accurate sense of the give-and-\ntake. But the way in which you just described it\nnow\u2014and this ties into other ways you have described\nit\u2014was taking on his mission, adapting yourself to his\nculture. So it\u2019s curious to me in what ways you see your-\nself adapting to Vic and in what ways you see yourself\nas a point of reference.\nET: I think I know what you\u2019re getting at. I think it\u2019s to\ndo with the fact that in my consciousness I understood\nwhat Vic\u2019s agenda was, and as it developed I understood\nit. I don\u2019t think there was any point at which I didn\u2019t\nunderstand it. He\u2019s not here to ask, but I think he\u2019d say\nhe was doing a lot of things in reference to me. He was\ntesting things off of me to a certain extent. He would\nframe things in a way that I could absorb, and this is\nrather sexual, actually. Because I was there, he would do\nthings in a certain way, or frame things in a certain way.\nI didn\u2019t have to tell him what to say, I didn\u2019t have to\ndirect. But he knew I was receptive to certain things, and\nhe knew how my mind was moving and was perhaps\ntelepathic. So he would do this, and I would suggest to\nhim what he was thinking, too. You see? And then he\nwould develop it, and vice versa. This was the\ncollaboration.\nBut then, when you look at the collaboration, as you\u2019ve\ninsisted upon doing, you see this thing from his point of\nview. And if he were here (which he isn\u2019t), he would be\nshowing this himself, you know? But I was very con-\nscious in this social world that I was not trained at Uni-\nversity College, London, and all the rest. Therefore, I\nvalued very much this part of me that was interacting\nwith Vic, and looking at myself as the adaptable person.\nI was, in a way, determined to develop this like an art\nform. I would think about this. And therefore, well, I\nthink he translated this into communitas. It was there.\nIt was conscious, but he didn\u2019t look at it as a woman\nwould. It wasn\u2019t so personal to him, as it sometimes isn\u2019t\nwith men. But he did know what communitas was, and\nhe loved it.\nSo, I think this is how it was. And there is such a thing\nas being a woman and being a man. It\u2019s absolute rubbish\nto say there are just human beings, because one is very\nmuch sexualized. And true, this is structured in our so-\nciety. Conscious persons know they have to live in this\nworld and will adapt as they can. That\u2019s what was going\non. Does that answer your question? Or is there some-\nthing more?\nME: I think that gives me a sense of the connections you\nsee between the two of you and even \u201cgoing native.\u201d\nLet\u2019s talk more about these ideas of \u201cthe man\u201d and \u201cthe\nwoman\u201d and the different roles, perceptions, and atti-\ntudes. I think talking about these as concrete, essential\nrealities is another strong characteristic of your work,\nsomething that you don\u2019t shy away from. It\u2019s also some-\nthing that a lot of anthropologists would be critical\nof\u2014not seeing these as categories that can be broken\ndown. You talk about religion in these terms, too. It\u2019s\nsomething that\u2019s not a social construction\u2014which is a\nvery nonanthropological viewpoint.\nET: Absolutely. I\u2019m highly conscious of this. I\u2019ve been\nworking away at trying to shift this from all kinds of\nangles. Yes, I\u2019m quite aware of what I\u2019m feebly trying to\ndo.\nME: So tell me something about your latest work, from\nThe Spirit and the Drum to what you\u2019ve been doing in\nIreland over the past five years.\nET: I got the manuscript for The Spirit under control in\nthe summer of 1985, when I was on my own and there\nwasn\u2019t anybody in the house at all. There were some\nplaces in it that I was bothered about, and I had a chance\nfrom that May onwards to have a look at it. And I saw\nthat what I\u2019d got was centered on four rituals; the boys\u2019\nand girls\u2019 initiations, the Tukuka healing ritual, and the\nChihamba. In the 1980s, the material was more vivid to\nme. I was more convinced, for instance, that Manyosa\nhad gone into trance. I was more sure of the symbols,\nmore sure that these were a force in themselves in this\nsituation\u2014symbols that were playing their own sym-\nphony, as it were. I didn\u2019t have any qualms about the\nway it was written. I cared if people read it, but I didn\u2019t\nwant to put it into an academic frame, really. So I thought\nabout it in much the same terms as I had originally writ-\nten it in the 1950s, but by the 1980s the material was\nmuch richer to me. All the work that Vic and I had done\nover the years confirmed what I wanted to do, confirmed\nmy own sense of the human story, and it is portrayed in\nThe Spirit and the Drum.\nME: The reviews of that book are interesting because\nmost of the reviewers obviously didn\u2019t know about the\nhistory of the book\u2014that it was first conceived and ex-\necuted in the 1950s. I\u2019m thinking particularly of George\nMarcus\u2019s [1987] review in Parabola, where he said that\nit was a first-rate account of the postmodern approach\nto writing narrative anthropology. I thought this was a\nwonderful instance of how the categories we use are\ntricks to define ourselves. Do you think of that book as\na postmodern text?\nET: I think of it, as well as Experiencing Ritual [E. Turner\n1992], as evidence that this is where anthropology might\nbe going\u2014the richer the better. Human material is al-\nmost impossibly rich, and so we have a mandate now to\ngo ahead and unfold the full richness of humankind to\nthe best of our ability. It\u2019s there, and we should all try\nto show it. It\u2019s a marvelous field, anthropology, and I see\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n852 F current anthropology\nExperiencing Ritual fitting somewhere into all of this.\nWhether it\u2019s postmodern or not, I want to recount the\nrelevant details to anyone who will listen. There should\nbe an accumulation of these pieces to engage the aca-\ndemic stages of theory making.\nME: When I read Experiencing Ritual I was struck by\nthe different ways in which you referred to Vic through-\nout the text. There are passages that create a sense of\nintimacy, and there are passages that create a sense of\nscholarly distance. In some passages it\u2019s \u201cVic\u201d or \u201cmy\nhusband,\u201d and in others it\u2019s \u201cas Turner argues,\u201d and so\non.\nET: The fat and the thin Vic, really. It\u2019s like Philip Kab-\nwita, who had a fat and a thin side. Vic had a lean and\nmuscular mind and rather a fat body! You had to respect\nthat lean and muscular mind in the writing and also the\nother side.\nME: I assume that the specific ways you referred to him\nwere strategically placed.\nET: Of course. To engage with the academic side of an-\nthropology has meant engaging with the canon, and so\nI\u2019ve had to think of him in that way. But he was also a\nvery full human being. These were dialogues of a sort.\nME: I have another question to do with the Ihamba ritual\nyou describe and the tooth you saw. I think there would\nbe a lot of anthropologists who would say that it\u2019s all a\nbit crazy, your seeing a spirit form.\nET: Yes, yes. Some people, including some anthropolo-\ngists, think this is crazy. I\u2019ve been helped by Roy Wagner\nin this. The tooth is a peculiarly strong thing, and so,\nwas this going through the veins? And the concept of a\nspirit tooth is also somewhat strange. Jesus said, \u201cPut\nyour fingers in the holes in my hands and you will be-\nlieve.\u201d This is a spirit figure, coming after the crucifix-\nion, and yet this poor guy Thomas was able to feel it.\nAnd people say this is a myth. How could it be?\nI was certain it happened to me. I didn\u2019t actually see\na tiny little tooth coming out of the skin. I saw the spirit\nobject, a gray blob, come out. I don\u2019t know whether a\nconcrete tooth came out of the vein, or a spirit tooth as\na gray blob came out. But I saw it, whatever it was. And\none does not retract things like that, you know? I know\nit\u2019s hard for people, but if they begin to take in a little\nof the reports they hear (like Evans-Pritchard walking in\nthe Azande village and seeing a spirit light) then we can\nget somewhere. We haven\u2019t sufficiently grappled with\nthese issues, and yet they don\u2019t go away. There are al-\nways more coming up. It stays like a tooth in our veins,\nif I can put it that way. We don\u2019t know what to do. I just\nlike to go on with this study on the quiet. It\u2019s the same\nwith my work in Point Hope, Alaska, and in Ireland. I\nwill always try to get into the thick of things in this way,\nwhether it\u2019s the whale spirit in Alaska or visions of Mary\nat Knock Shrine in Ireland.\nSometimes I wonder what Vic would think of me now.\nWhat would he think of me running shamanistic ses-\nsions? How would he think of my Catholicism, in which\nI say, \u201cGod the Mother Almighty\u201d? There\u2019s a certain\nfeminism in this. What I\u2019m doing now is an extension\nof the Chihamba, the White Spirit side of Vic, not the\nDrums of Affliction side. I obviously take off from the\nspiritual side of thinking. I don\u2019t get any visions or\nflashes about what Vic would think, but I\u2019m grateful to\nthat guy, and, God, the communitas. The conversations\nwith Vic were marvelous. We would get breakthroughs\nright and left. Those were great times.\nI think we can go on with Victor Turner\u2019s work. My\nwork, of course, is relatively obscure, but it does affect\na small range of people, and I think there\u2019s a certain\ncommunitas in it. I always hope we might get some\nbreakthroughs.\nReferences Cited\nf r e u d , s i g m u n d . 1955 The interpretation of dreams. Trans-\nlated and edited by James Strachey.

However, on August 3, 1998,\nPatrick Russell, a member of the excavation team at\nHohle Fels Cave, located near Schelklingen, Germany\n(fig. 1), recovered a painted rock fragment from an ar-\nchaeological horizon containing abundant Magdalenian\nartifacts. The find was photographed in situ and belongs\nto geological stratum 1k. This fragment of limestone pre-\nserves a double row of seven and a truncated double row\nof four dark-red, subcircular dots and provides new ev-\nidence for rock painting in Central Europe. While an\nearlier age cannot be ruled out, stylistic and contextual\narguments suggest that the depiction dates to the Mag-\ndalenian (Conard and Floss 1999). The rich Magdalenian\nlayers of Hohle Fels are well documented and date to ca.\n13,000 b.p. (Blumentritt and Hahn 1991, Housley et al.\n1997, Conard and Uerpmann 1999).\nHohle Fels Cave is located at an elevation of 543 m\nabove sea level in the Ach Valley near Schelklingen, ca.\n20 km west of Ulm. Along with the nearby Blau and\nLone Valleys, the Ach Valley, with its many caves, forms\nthe heartland for Paleolithic research in southwestern\nGermany (Mu\u00a8ller-Beck 1983). The cave is one of the larg-\nest of the Swabian Jura, with a 30-m-long entrance pas-\nsage leading to a main hall with an area of 500 m2 and\na ceiling as high as 12 m (Blumentritt and Hahn 1991).\nThe entrance passage to the cave, 6 m wide and 3 m\nhigh, opens toward the north-northwest and is situated\nroughly 100 m southeast of and 7 m above the Ach River.\nHohle Fels has been studied by several generations of\nscholars beginning with the work of Oskar Fraas (1872)\nand continuing into the 20th century with the work of\nRobert R. Schmidt (1912). More recently Gustav Riek\nconducted excavations in the entrance to the cave from\n1958 to 1960 (Saier 1994). Further excavations were con-\n1. q 2000 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological\nResearch.

We thank Harald Floss, Gerhard Bosinski,\nand Michael Bolus for their helpful comments and A. Frey, H. Jen-\nsen, and Andrew Kandel for technical support. We are particularly\nindebted to A. Aksoy for his careful work in conserving the painted\nwall fragment from Hohle Fels.\nducted under the direction of Joachim Hahn of the Uni-\nversity of Tu\u00a8bingen in 1977\u201379 and 1987\u201396. These ex-\ncavations again focused on the entrance rather than the\npresumably more disturbed deposits in the interior of\nthe cave (Blumentritt and Hahn 1991, Hahn 1997a).\nHahn reopened the excavation at Hohle Fels with the\ngoal of recovering archaeological material from a chrono-\nstratigraphic setting similar to that from his nearby ex-\ncavation at Geissenklo\u00a8sterle (Hahn 1977a). Following\nHahn\u2019s death, excavation at the site has continued under\nour direction from 1997 to 1999 and has focused on ec-\nological and economic questions related to the Upper\nPaleolithic of the region. Beyond the important Magda-\nlenian and Gravettian deposits at Hohle Fels (fig. 2), the\nsite shows potential for yielding both Aurignacian and\nMiddle Paleolithic materials, as is the case at sites in-\ncluding Geissenklo\u00a8sterle in the Ach Valley and Hohlen-\nstein-Stadel and Vogelherd in the Lone Valley (Hahn\n1977b, Mu\u00a8ller-Beck 1983).\nThe debate over the presence of parietal art in Central\nEurope has lasted for decades and has been characterized\nby a series of claims and subsequent refutations for the\nexistence of cave painting since the recognition of Pa-\nleolithic cave paintings in France and Cantabrian Spain\nat the turn of the 20th century (Conard and Floss 1999).\nOver the past three decades, the work of Joachim Hahn\nhas played a central role in regional research on Paleo-\nlithic art. Hahn\u2019s excavations at Geissenklo\u00a8sterle pro-\nvided new evidence for Aurignacian figurines (Hahn\n1986) that complemented the previously excavated\nmammoth ivory statues recovered from Vogelherd (Riek\n1934) and Hohlenstein-Stadel (Schmid 1989, Hahn 1986).\nSusanne Mu\u00a8nzel\u2019s archaeozoological work also led to the\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n854 F current anthropology\nFig. 2. Schematic stratigraphic profile of Hohle Fels including four major stratigraphic units (after Conard and\nUerpmann 1999): A, with finds from the Magdalenian and radiocarbon ages of ca. 13,000 b.p.; B, corresponding\nto the last glacial maximum, ca. 20,000 b.p.; C, containing Gravettian finds and dating to ca. 29,000 b.p.; and\nD, containing early Upper Paleolithic finds from a test excavation.\nrecovery of the remains of two bone flutes from Geis-\nsenklo\u00a8sterle including one made from the radius of a\nswan (Hahn and Mu\u00a8nzel 1995). These musical instru-\nments and the ivory figurines from the site stem from\nthe Aurignacian find horizon II and date to ca 33,500 b.p.\nwith radiocarbon and 37,000 b.p. with thermolumines-\ncence (Richter et al. 2000).\nPrior to the 1970s, painted stones had been recovered\nfrom several sites in southern Germany. Best-known\namong these are several painted stones from the Mag-\ndalenian which were excavated in 1912 by J. Fraunholz\nin collaboration with H. Obermaier at Obere Klause (Ob-\nermaier 1914, Freund 1963, Bosinski 1982). Additionally,\nE. Soergel and W. Soergel recovered a 9.4 # 5.5 # 2.2-\ncm painted cobble of either Magdalenian or Late Pale-\nolithic age from Hohlenstein\u2013Kleine Scheuer in 1923\n(Wetzel 1961, Hahn and von Koenigswald 1977), while\nG. Riek\u2019s excavations at Vogelherd (Riek 1934) and\nHohle Fels (Saier 1994) provided further examples of\nstones and rock fragments with traces of pigment. Saier\n(1994) describes five painted rock fragments from the\nMagdalenian layers of Riek\u2019s excavation at Hohle Fels\nand has been able to refit one specimen to a broken cob-\nble from Hahn\u2019s more recent excavation there. Among\nthe early finds from Obere Klause, Kleine Scheuer, and\nHohle Fels, rows of small red dots and faint lines con-\nstitute the most common motifs. Despite the existence\nof earlier ivory figurines from the Aurignacian, female\nfigurines and occasional figurative engravings from\nGravettian contexts, and hundreds of figurative engrav-\nings from the Magdalenian (Bosinski 1982, Hahn 1986,\nScheer 1994), figurative painting is entirely unknown in\nGermany. Moreover, with the possible exception of a\npurported painted animal from By\u00b4ci Ska\u00b4la Cave (Oliva\n1996), figurative painting has remained absent in the Pa-\nleolithic of Central Europe.\nHahn\u2019s careful excavations at Geissenklo\u00a8sterle and\nHohle Fels provided more recent evidence for Paleolithic\npainting in addition to the stones mentioned above.\nNoteworthy are two finds of Aurignacian age from Geis-\nsenklo\u00a8sterle. One is an 8.5 # 6 # 4.5-cm piece of lime-\nstone with red, yellow, and black pigment from layer IIb.\nThe other is a limestone fragment from the lower Au-\nrignacian layer IIIa, which Hahn (1988) describes as pre-\nserving a black V-shape. Hahn argues that this 10 # 10\n# 3-cm piece, which appears to stem from the wall of\nthe cave, was intentionally painted. While this interpre-\ntation is plausible, the irregular nature of the black and\nbrown color could be the result of natural processes or\nincidental human agency. Hahn\u2019s excavations at Hohle\nFels have also yielded at least three examples of stones\npreserving traces of red pigment (Blumentritt and Hahn\n1991, Scheer 1994). These often poorly preserved finds,\nas well as the material from earlier excavations, provide\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 855\nFig. 3. The painted fragment of limestone from Hohle\nFels, scale in cm. (Photo H. Jensen)\nconvincing evidence for nonfigurative painting on mo-\nbile objects, small stones in particular. Before the dis-\ncovery of the new find from Hohle Fels, however, no\nconvincing evidence for cave painting had been recov-\nered within Germany. While the new depiction stops\nshort of furnishing definitive proof of the existence of\ncave painting in the region, it does provide the best ev-\nidence thus far for parietal art in Germany.\nThe new find from Hohle Fels measures 7.6 # 5.9 #\n1.7 cm and was recovered from geological horizon 1k.\nThe painted surface is smooth, whereas the reverse side\npreserves unweathered, angular surfaces. The find pre-\nserves two double rows of 4\u20137-mm oval red dots (fig. 3).\nOne double row is complete and depicts seven subpar-\nallel pairs of dots. The other double row includes four\npairs of dots and is clearly truncated, indicating that the\ndepiction originally continued beyond the limits of the\ncurrent piece.\nWhat distinguishes this find from the objects men-\ntioned above is the excellent preservation of the pigment\nand particularly the recognition that the reverse side pre-\nserves unweathered, angular surfaces. This observation\nindicates that the limestone fragment in all likelihood\nstems from the wall of the cave. This stone fragment is\ncomposed of the same granular Upper Jurassic limestone\nthat forms the walls of the cave. While fragments of the\ncave wall are extremely common within the Paleolithic\nfind horizons of the cave, this is the first such fragment\nto preserve unambiguous evidence for painting. The col-\nlapse and fragmentation of the cave walls have been\nclosely documented by Hahn (1991) in connection with\nhis study of scratches on polished surfaces of the former\nwalls of Hohle Fels. The apparently ubiquitous fragmen-\ntation and collapse of the cave walls of the region may\nhelp to explain the scarcity of parietal art in the region.\nWhile the theoretical possibility exists that the lime-\nstone fragment was painted after it fell from the wall,\nthe truncation of the depiction and the fresh, angular\nnature of the broken surfaces of the specimen indicate\nthat it was originally part of a larger representation on\nthe wall of Hohle Fels rather than a piece of mobile art.\nIn the context of southern Germany, the motif painted\non the new find from Hohle Fels shows particularly\nstrong similarities with the best-known painted stone\nfrom Obere Klause, where three double rows of seven\nsmall red dots are depicted on a rounded, 16-cm-long,\nelongated piece of limestone (Obermaier 1914, Mu\u00a8ller-\nBeck and Albrecht 1987). Although the general absence\nof parietal art makes comparisons within Central Europe\nimpossible, diverse depictions of red dots and rows of red\ndots are well known in the Paleolithic art of Western\nEurope, for example, at Niaux (Clottes 1995), Grotte Car-\nriot (Lorblanchet 1984), and Grotte Le Travers de Janoye\n(Clottes and Lautier 1984; Bosinski, personal commu-\nnication, 1999).\nThis painted wall fragment from a Magdalenian layer\nat Hohle Fels provides the best evidence to date for pa-\nrietal art in Germany and helps to fill a gap in our knowl-\nedge of Paleolithic art that appears to be in part dictated\nby the poor preservation of cave walls in the karst region\nof Central Europe.\nReferences Cited\nb l u m e n t r i t t , r . , a n d j . h a h n . 1991.

Cooperative reproduction is highly unusual from\nan interspecific perspective and is especially challenging\nto evolutionary theory, compelling primatologists and\nbiologists to devote considerable attention to parenting\nbehaviors exhibited by alloparents (individuals other\nthan the parent) toward conspecific young (e.g., Reidman\n1982, Emlen 1984, McKenna 1987, Small 1990, Clutton-\nBrock 1991). From an explosion of research on animal\nbehavior since the 1960s, three general hypotheses have\ncome to dominate ecological perspectives on apparently\naltruistic parenting behaviors: nepotism, reciprocity, and\nlearning-to-mother.\n1. Nepotism predicts a substantial amount of variation\nin alloparenting both within and between species (Mc-\nKenna 1987). Investing in kin is considered an extension\nof investing in one\u2019s own genetic reproduction, as the\ndegree to which genes are shared is expected to predict\nshared fitness interests. This equation, however, like all\nevolutionary predictions, is economic in nature and\nweighted by the relative costs and benefits to individuals\nof alternative behaviors within a specific environmental\ncontext (Williams 1966, Altmann 1979, Emlen 1995).\nThe costs and benefits of particular behavioral strategies\nare determined by ecological interactions of the social\nand physical environment and individual life-history pa-\nrameters affecting survival, growth, development, and\nreproduction. Human life history sets the stage for at\nleast two important opportunities for kin, as well as oth-\ners, to care, with important coevolutionary conse-\nquences. Parents nurture multiple weaned dependents,\n1. q 2000 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological\nResearch.

Consistent with theoretical indications that\na lengthy developmental period favors allocare by re-\ntained related \u201chelpers-at-the-nest\u201d (Lack 1966, Brown\n1987, Koenig et al. 1992), sibling care is the most com-\nmon form of alloparenting in traditional societies (Weis-\nner and Gallimore 1977). In addition to the prereprod-\nuctive period, early female reproductive senescence may\nincrease the probability of completing investment in\nlater-born young (Lancaster and King 1985, Hill and Hur-\ntado 1991, Hawkes et al. 1998) and enhance the repro-\nductive efforts of adult offspring through assistance in\nfood getting (Hawkes 1997) or child care (Hill and Hur-\ntado 1996).\n2. Reciprocity. Other interspecific research suggests\nthat where the costs of aiding unrelated young are less\nthan the costs of leaving the group (e.g., because of pre-\ndation pressure, low food availability, or social compe-\ntition), unrelated helpers may assist parents in return for\nenhanced access to physical (e.g., food, territory) and so-\ncial (e.g., alliance, mating) resources necessary for repro-\nduction (Ligon 1983, Reyer 1984, Davies 1990). Emlen\n(1982a, b) modeled the fitness payoffs of helping between\nunrelated individuals, concluding that contributing re-\nsources to the reproductive success of an unrelated in-\ndividual would be a successful strategy for both helper\nand beneficiary if they resided in a marginal environment\nwith highly unpredictable access to the resources nec-\nessary for reproduction. Comparative analyses suggest\nthat cooperative breeding is found in environments that\nare extremely limited in resources or saturated with con-\nspecifics, limiting opportunities for juvenile or subor-\ndinate individuals to secure food, mates, space, or other\nresources necessary for independent reproduction (Clut-\nton-Brock 1991). By definition, small traditional societies\nlack the intensive stratification that results in large-scale\nsubversion of the reproductive interests of some mem-\nbers of the group to the advantage of others. However,\ncross-cultural research confirms that demographic, ec-\nonomic, and social limitations commonly impinge on an\nindividual\u2019s ability to mate and parent young in these\npopulations (Irons 1983; Hill and Kaplan 1988a, b; Bailey\n1991a; Hill and Hurtado 1996). The extent of cooperative\nbehavior exhibited within human groups, on a scale un-\nparalleled in other species, suggests that in some eco-\nlogical contexts allocare by unrelated but frequently in-\nteracting individuals may be included in the suite of\nshared and reciprocal social behaviors, such as cooper-\native resource acquisition and food sharing, that char-\nacterize traditional behavioral patterns.\n3. Learning-to-mother. Like the reciprocity hypothe-\nsis, the learning-to-mother hypothesis predicts that per-\nsonal but delayed fitness benefits are associated with\nalloparenting. Through skills gained from caring for the\nyoung of others, prereproductive individuals may in-\ncrease the chances of survival for their own future off-\nspring without incurring the risks to their young of in-\nexperienced care (Spencer-Booth 1970, Lancaster 1971,\nMcKenna 1987). This hypothesis is based on several ob-\nservations: (a) parenting skills do not appear to be innate\namong primates; (b) survivorship among primate off-\nspring is highly dependent on the quality of care they\nreceive; and (c) the infant mortality rate for primiparous\nfemale primates is higher than that for multiparous ones.\nField studies report increasing reproductive success with\nage due to increasing reproductive skills in a number of\nnonprimate species as well (Lack 1966, Charlesworth\n1980, Clutton-Brock 1988). Perhaps in no species is the\nquality of care more critical to developmental outcome\nand future reproductive success of young than in hu-\nmans, with important life-history consequences for par-\nents, caregivers, and their wards (Bogin 1998, Charles-\nworth 1988, Hrdy 1992, Chisholm 1999). As predicted\nby their future role as mothers, cross-culturally, young\ngirls most frequently perform allocare (Barry, Bacon, and\nChild 1957, Weisner and Gallimore 1977).\nThe hypotheses of nepotism, reciprocity, and learning-\nto-mother suggest specific life-history strategies for al-\nloparenting the young of others (table 1). Evolutionary\necological theory predicts that caregivers will allocate\ninvestment on the basis of the inclusive-fitness costs and\nbenefits of providing care, with individuals giving care\nto the closest dependent who is likely to benefit from\nchild care efforts. The probability and amount of in-\nvestment should be determined by (1) the degree of re-\nlatedness between the potential caregiver and the child\nand (2) the ratio of the cost of care to the caregiver\u2019s\nfitness to the fitness benefit received by the child. While\necological theory implies an economic impact (i.e., cost\nor benefit) of behavior on individual reproduction, mea-\nsuring the survival or reproductive consequences asso-\nciated with specific behaviors remains challenging (Rog-\ners 1990, Clutton-Brock 1991, Lessells 1991, Kaplan\n1997). The potential overlap of individual investment\ninterests (e.g., kinship and reciprocal interests) and the\ncompeting tradeoffs of alternative behaviors (i.e., oppor-\ntunity costs) complicates the task of assigning costs and\nbenefits of behaviors to individual fitness. With regard\nto these constraints, this investigation assumes a tem-\nporally proximate focus: to examine the distribution of\nEfe infant allocare across caregivers to assess the ex-\nplanatory strength of alternative hypotheses.\nalloparenting among the efe\nWhile some form of allocare has been described, at least\nqualitatively, in most hunter-gatherer societies, the most\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n858 F current anthropology\nextreme example of alloparenting in a foraging popula-\ntion has been reported for the Efe of the Ituri Forest. Data\ncollected in 1982\u201383 showed that the percentage of time\nyoung infants spent in physical contact with individuals\nother than their mothers increased from 39% at 3 weeks\nto 60% at 18 weeks. During observations infants were\ncared for by an average of 14.2 different persons, with a\nrange of 5 to 24 (Tronick, Morelli, and Winn 1987). Tron-\nick et al. hypothesized that this communal pattern of\ncare was a cultural adaptation to the thermoregulatory\nchallenges faced by Efe infants. Infants on average weigh\n2.4 kg at birth, a weight considered \u201cat risk\u201d in the West-\nern medical context (Tronick and Winn 1992). Peacock\n(1985) and Hewlett (1991) have suggested that the unique\npattern of Efe infant care may be explained by high rates\nof infertility among reproductive-age Efe women. Tron-\nick, Morelli, and Winn (1989), however, found that the\nfrequency of care by nulliparous adult females did not\naccount for the extent of allocare. A number of studies\ndescribe Efe child care from a developmental point of\nview (Tronick, Winn, and Morelli 1987; Morelli and\nTronick 1991; Morelli 1987, 1997; Tronick, Morelli, and\nIvey 1992); however, it remains unclear why so many\nindividuals among the Efe forfeit their time and energy\nto provide care to the young of others. This investigation\nwas prompted by the challenge of alloparenting behavior\nto ecological precepts: Who cares for Efe infants, and\nwhat are the costs and benefits to alloparents of child\ncare services rendered?\nthe study population\nA corpus of research provides details of the environment\nand lives of the Efe (cf. Morelli 1987, Peacock 1985, El-\nlison, Peacock, and Lager 1986, Tronick, Morelli, and\nWinn 1987, Wilkie 1988, Fisher and Strickland 1989, Jen-\nike 1987, Bailey and DeVore 1989, Bailey 1991a, Wilkie\nand Curran 1993). The Efe are widely accepted to be the\nmost traditional population of pygmies in Africa. They\nassociate with horticultural groups in an elaborate\nexchange system whereby farmers trade cultivated foods\nand material goods (e.g., cloth and metal) for the valuable\nforest resources of meat, honey, medicines, and building\nmaterials (Wilkie 1989, Bailey 1991a). The Efe periodi-\ncally provide labor in the gardens of the Sudanic-speak-\ning Lese; however, since the end of colonial harvest quo-\ntas in the 1960s, the severe deterioration of roads, and\nthe collapse of the cash market since the 1980s, most\nLese gardens have contracted to subsistence level. Labor\ndemands are intermittent, and many Efe lack access to\nopportunities for garden work. While some Efe have es-\ntablished their own gardens, they tend to be small and\ncommunal, with low and unpredictable yields (Wilkie\nand Curran 1993). Only one focal family in this inves-\ntigation planted a small shared seasonal garden of\ncassava.\nThe Efe live in camps ranging from 6 to 45 people,\nwith an average of 21. Typically, they clear a small area\nof forest (10\u201315 m diameter) and construct low huts in\nan open semicircle around a communal space in which\nmost daily camp activities occur. Although descent is\npatrilineal and residence is virilocal, maternal relatives\nmay also live in the natal camp because of sororal mar-\nriage exchange between clans. Nuclear families share a\nhut, which is primarily used for storage and sleeping,\nand a cooking hearth, but children, including infants, are\nby no means restricted from playing, exploring, and even\nsleeping in other areas of camp. Efe women usually travel\ntogether in small groups to gather forest produce, such\nas fruits, nuts, tubers, and mushrooms, fish in the\nstreams that traverse the forest, or forage for bananas,\ncassava, and sweet potato in abandoned gardens. Garden\nlabor is highly seasonal; during planting and harvest Efe\nwomen may assist Lese women, and Efe men are usually\nengaged in horticultural work only to fell trees when\nnew gardens are cleared from the forest. Efe males hunt\nwith bow and arrow in groups, using dogs and hunters\nto flush game to waiting bowmen, or hunt primates sol-\nitarily by stealth. Camps move on an average of every\nsix weeks in response to changing access to forest and\nhorticultural resources, from near-village gardens during\nplanting and harvest to deeper in the forest during prime\nhoney, fishing, and hunting seasons (Bailey and Peacock\n1988, Wilkie and Curran 1993).\nmethods\nData were collected between January 1988 and October\n1989 in 18 camps within a 36-km radius of the Ituri\nProject research station in northeastern Democratic Re-\npublic of the Congo. The focal subject sampling tech-\nnique (Altmann 1974, Borgerhoff Mulder and Caro 1985)\nwas adapted to record the behaviors of infant and mother\nsimultaneously across all contexts, with the infant as\nthe priority focal subject. The focal sample consisted of\n20 infants (13 females and 7 males) between 12 and 15\nmonths of age. Infants were observed for eight 15-minute\nsessions sampled across two consecutive and typical\ndays, evenly distributed across daylight hours. Behaviors\nwere continuously recorded as they occurred on a laptop\ncomputer that simultaneously tracked real time, facili-\ntating a calculation of the absolute duration of events.\nTime measures were adjusted to a 12-hour day. Scans\nrecording the identity of all individuals within visual or\nclose hearing range of the infant (i.e., within a reasonable\ndistance to respond to infant distress) were conducted\nimmediately before and after each block of continuous\nbehavioral coding, and departures and approaches of in-\ndividuals were recorded as they occurred, to calculate\nthe total proportion of time that individuals were in\nphysical proximity to the infant. All exchanges of ma-\nterial goods, including food and other resources, between\nparents and individuals other than dependent children\nwere recorded, whether they occurred within coding pe-\nriods or not. Systematic and informal interviews were\nconducted with mothers and other caregivers in an at-\ntempt to elucidate other avenues of reciprocity, includ-\ning friendships and economic associations. The habitu-\nation period included several months of frequent and\nextended visits to camps.

Interobserver reliability was\nestablished in the field with a colleague and calculated\n(Cohen\u2019s kappa), yielding a mean kappa coefficient of .90\n(range .85\u2013.96) across all behaviors.\nDemographic records for 8 of the 18 camps have been\nmaintained since 1979 by Ituri Project researchers and\nlocal assistants. New records were created to include\ncamps not included in prior censuses and were cross-\nverified in interviews with group members and members\nof associated camps and through independent data col-\nlected by a local assistant. The ages of many individuals\nin the study area were known from previous records and\nlocal census taking. Unknown ages were interpolated\nrelative to known-age individuals and specific local his-\ntorical events of known date and cross-checked with den-\ntal exams (for children) and interviews. Lineage histories\nof two or more generations\u2019 depth have also been main-\ntained by the Ituri Project researchers. Kinship was in-\ndependently verified by Efe camp members and local as-\nsistants, and new records were created for the remaining\ncamps. The Efe maintain distinctions between consan-\nguineal, affinal, and fictive kinship, facilitating the cal-\nculation of genetic distance between infants and others.\nIndividuals identified as consanguineally related to the\nfocal infant are ranked according to estimated genetic\ndistance (e.g., full siblings are related .50 to an infant,\naunts .25). Relatives related more distantly than an es-\ntimated .125 to the infant are grouped in the analyses.\nIndividuals identified as not consanguineally related to\nthe infant are treated as unrelated. An allocaregiver was\ndefined as anyone other than the mother in physical or\nsocial contact with the focal infant.\nThe question \u201cWho cares for infants?\u201d may be con-\nceptualized analytically in a number of ways. The logis-\ntic regression technique (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989)\nis intuitively and theoretically appealing, as odds ratios\nassigned to categorical covariates in a model allow for a\nbiologically meaningful interpretation (see Hill and Hur-\ntado 1996). Because the probabilistic outcome variable\nis dichotomous (that is, allocare or not), other multivar-\niate techniques are used to take advantage of the sen-\nsitivity and precision of the data set, where behaviors\nare measured continuously. The analyses include (1) gen-\neral descriptive statistics of care across infants, (2) logis-\ntic regression modeling of the probability of allocare\namong potential caregivers, (3) linear regression model-\ning of demographic variables on time in allocare, (4) lin-\near regression fit of allocaretaking time to classes of po-\ntential caregivers (e.g., boys, girls, adult males and\nfemales, postreproductive adults), (5) assessment of the\ncost of care to actual allocaregivers, and (6) analyses of\necological correlates of allocare.

Infants receive 41% of\ncare from individuals other than the mother, and fathers\npresent (two died before the infant was one year of age\nand two were absent from camp on extended hunting\ntrips) averaged 8% of total care and 20% of alloparental\ncare. The mean number of allocaregivers interacting\nwith the focal infant during observations is 11, with a\nrange from 2 to 21. Infant sex is not associated with the\nnumber or any demographic characteristic of caregivers\nor with the amount of care received.\nLogistic regression model of the occurrence of allo-\ncare. Neither the proportion of time in proximity to an\ninfant nor the sex of the potential caregiver is signifi-\ncantly associated with the probability of performing al-\nlocare. Age, however, is negatively related to the prob-\nability of care (univariate beta coefficient p .023,\nchi-square p 15.964, p ! .0001). Table 2 presents the best-\nfit logistic regression model, controlling for proximity,\nsex, and age of potential interactant: reproductive status\nand genetic relatedness are significantly associated with\nthe probability of allocare. There are no significant in-\nteraction effects between variables. Odds ratios pre-\nsented assess how much a particular factor\u2014controlling\nfor others\u2014increases or decreases the likelihood that al-\nloparenting will occur, using the absent category (repro-\nductively active [i.e., with dependent offspring] and un-\nrelated [estimated genetic distance p .00]) as the basis\nof comparison. Prereproductive individuals (4 to 17 years)\nare no more likely to perform allocare than reproduc-\ntively active adults (18 to 49 years), but nonreproductive\nadults are 2.5 times more likely and postreproductive\nindividuals (50 years and older) 3 times more likely to\nalloparent than reproductively active adults. The effect\nof relatedness is substantial: kin are more than twice as\nlikely as nonkin to contribute to allocare, and siblings\nand fathers (genetic relatedness p .50) are over 17 times\nmore likely to perform infant care.\nLinear regression model of the amount of time spent\nin allocare. Variation in the amount of time that indi-\nvidual Efe devote to infant allocare is considerable, rang-\ning from 0 to 5.8 hours per day. In a full model regression\nof independent variables describing the life-history var-\niation of the 412 potential allocaregivers, time in prox-\nimity and the characteristics of sex, age, relatedness, and\nreproductive status strongly predict the amount of time\nthat individuals spend caring for a focal infant as main\neffects (p p .0001) (table 3), accounting for 20% of the\nvariance in time Efe engage in allocare of one-year-olds.\nThere are no significant interaction effects. Relatedness\naccounts for only 3% of the variance in time in proximity\nto an infant and explains 16% of the variance in allo-\ncaregiving time. To standardize variance in access to a\nrelated infant between individuals within each group, z-\nscores of relatedness were assigned to potential allocare-\ngivers, with similar highly significant results on allo-\ncaregiving time (p p .0001). The time spent in proximity\nto an infant is significantly related to the amount of\nobserved time that individuals provide care in univariate\nanalysis (p p .001) but explains little of the variance\nbetween individuals in allocaregiving time (r2 p .03) and\nis controlled for in subsequent analyses.\nComparisons between individuals in allocaregiving\ntime. The significance of relatedness to participation in\nalloparental care is apparent when more familiar and so-\ncially meaningful categories reflecting sex, age, and kin-\nship are considered. Among females, sisters and aunts\nspend significantly more time interacting with infants\nthan sex- and age-matched unrelated individuals (fig. 1).\nWhile the mean proportion of observed time in allocare\nis several times higher for grandmothers than for unre-\nlated age-matched females (grandmothers p .09 [n p 4],\nothers p .02 [n p 8]), the sample sizes are small, limiting\nsignificance testing.

Among males,\nonly fathers, brothers, and cousins spend more time in\nallocare than do sex- and age-matched unrelated Efe (fig.\n2).\nOverall, differences between the sexes in time allo-\ncation to alloparenting are significant, but the prediction\nof increased allocare by females over males does not hold\nacross all ages (fig. 3). When ages are grouped into 10-\nyear intervals, the mean amount of time spent in inter-\naction is actually greater for males than females in the\nyoungest age-range, from 0 to 9 years, although the dif-\nference does not reach significance. There is no signifi-\ncant difference between the sexes until reproductive age\nat 20 to 29 years, when the mean for males declines\nsharply. When fathers are excluded from the analyses,\nthere is a significant difference in allocaretaking time\nbetween males and females throughout the reproductive\nperiod (i.e., 20 to 49 years). Sex differences for postre-\nproductive-age adults, 50 years and older, approach but\ndo not reach significance (p p .08), with older females\ncontributing more than males to infant care.\nReproductive status has an independent effect on the\ntime that Efe women devote to infant allocare, control-\nling for the effects of age. Reproduction (i.e., parenting)\ninfluences the allocaregiving time of reproductive-age fe-\nmales but not reproductive-age males, whether measured\nas the presence or number of dependent offspring, the\nage of the youngest dependent, or the presence of a nurs-\ning infant. With the exception of fathers, reproductive-\nage males perform little allocare. While prereproductive\nand postreproductive females do not differ significantly\nfrom reproductive-age women with or without depen-\ndent offspring, nonreproductive women spent signifi-\ncantly more time in infant allocaregiving than repro-\nductively active women (fig. 4). There is a suggestion\nthat nursing mothers are especially constrained (or un-\ninterested) in alloparenting: the mean amount of allocare\nthat nursing mothers perform is half of that of mothers\nwithout nursing infants.\nRegression fit to hypothesized allocaregivers. Separate\nregressions were fit for categories of allocaregivers pre-\ndicted by theory (table 4). Only relatedness to the infant\nweakly predicts alloparenting by adult males (18 years\nand older) excluding fathers, and no variables predict care\nby postreproductive (50 years and older) males. The time\nthat prereproductive age males (4 to 17 years) spend in-\nteracting with an infant is positively associated with re-\nlatedness and negatively associated with the number of\ndependents (i.e., siblings and foster children) in their own\nfamilies. If siblings of the focal infant are removed from\nthe analysis, the number of dependents in the family is\nno longer significant, suggesting that males provide care\nto infants when there are few other dependents to assist\nparents. Similarly, allocaregiving by young females (4 to\n17 years) is predicted by relatedness and the presence of\nsiblings in their own families. Again, only care by sibling\nallocaregivers is significantly affected by other depend-\nents in the family. Relatedness alone is predictive of al-\nlocaregiving by nonsibling children. Only time in prox-\nimity to an infant is related to care by reproductive-age\nwomen (18 to 49 years) without dependent young, and\nonly relatedness is predictive of allocaregiving by women\nwith dependent offspring. Time spent alloparenting by\npostreproductive-age (50 years and older) women is pre-\ndicted by relatedness alone.\nReciprocity and resource exchange. Resource ex-\nchanges involving fathers proved impractical to track\noutside the camp context, and there is no relation be-\ntween paternal exchanges in the camp setting and al-\nlocaregiver participation. Hunted resources are primarily\ndistributed at the kill site, and secondary distributions\nof meat often occur outside the camp context (e.g., in\ntrade with horticulturalists).

Women typically forage together in small groups,\nbut with the exception of fishing and occasional abun-\ndant food patches resources are usually collected indi-\nvidually and, in the case of food, distributed after pro-\ncessing to children and other dependents in the\nhousehold. The Efe possess few material resources, such\nas clothing or tools, and the transfer of these goods also\ndoes not appear to be associated with allocare.\nThere is also no relation between women identified\nby mothers as \u201cfriends\u201d (described as individuals that\nmothers tend to associate and share with most frequently\nor those who might provide care for the mother or her\nfamily in case she were ill) and resource exchanges, re-\nlatedness, or allocaregiving. It may be of interest that\n60% of women identified as \u201cfriends\u201d (n p 25) have no\ndependent offspring and that, while nonreproductive\nwomen represent 32% of the total population of repro-\nductive-age (18 to 49 years) women, they account for only\n12% of alloparental care received by infants. Women\nwith children closely associate with one another but do\nnot habitually share child care responsibilities. Efe al-\nloparenting is not characterized as a creche or nursery\nsystem whereby mothers leave their infants in camp\nwith others for extended periods while foraging: 92% of\nobserved time mothers were within visual or close hear-\ning range of their infants. Instead, working mothers are\noften accompanied by other, less burdened helpers, such\nas children.\nThe presence of foster children among the Efe suggests\nthat alloparenting by some juveniles may be reciprocated\nwith provisioning and protection by adults. Indeed, 27%\nof children have no parents in camp\u2014orphans, children\nof separated parents, or those living temporarily away\nfrom natal camps\u2014and Efe children are commonly trans-\nferred from high-dependency-ratio families to low-de-\npendency-ratio families for a period of months or even\nyears. While children 4 to 17 years of age without parents\nliving in the camp do not contribute significantly more\ntime in allocaregiving than children with parents resid-\ning in camp (excluding siblings of the infant in the com-\nparison), foster children residing in a subject infant\u2019s nu-\nclear family (n p 11) spend significantly more time\nproviding allocare than do other nonsibling children in\nthe camp (Mann-Whitney U, p p .0035). This finding\nholds when relatedness to the infant is controlled for in\nthe analysis. (Foster children are related on average .10\nto focal infants.) In fact, the mean amount of allocare\nthat foster children in the subject family provide exceeds\nthat of siblings, although the difference does not reach\nsignificance. The Efe commonly recruit older children,\nboth male and female, who are orphaned or belong to\nlarge sibships to assist primiparous mothers or mothers\nwho lack older offspring to assist with infant care. How-\never, not all new mothers have access to the services of\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 863\nFig. 5. Mean proportion of allocare received by infant\nby caregiver sex and kinship.\nother children. Six of the 20 subject infants do not have\nolder siblings and 9 have no siblings older than five years\nof age, but only 3 of these have a foster child living in\nthe nuclear family. Foster children tend to live in fam-\nilies with other children and are therefore subject to in-\ncreased competition over familial resources. Direct as-\nsistance in infant care may be one means by which foster\nchildren can reduce conflict over scarce food resources\nwithin their adopted (i.e., alloparental) family. Efe chil-\ndren, and especially siblings, at times do receive direc-\ntives from mothers to watch an infant, but the distri-\nbution or frequency of maternal directives does not\npredict children\u2019s contributions to allocare.\nThe costs of alloparenting. If alloparenting is a costly\nactivity in terms of time, energy, or lost opportunity, we\nwould expect obvious benefits to be accrued by partici-\npants; however, no directly measurable reciprocal pay-\noffs are found between parents and helpers. There are no\ndata on allocaregiver time allocation independent of care\nto assess the impact of infant interactions on alternative\nactivities; however, the average total time per day spent\nin allocaregiving and the nature of that care suggest a\npattern of potential costs. Table 5 shows the distribution\nof time spent caring for an infant across categories of\nactual (as opposed to potential) caregivers (n p 222). Ma-\nternal infant care time well surpasses that of allocare-\ngivers, but the investment of some alternative caregivers\nis not negligible. Mothers spend an average of six hours\na day caring for their infants, but the cumulative addition\nof a number of related caregivers results in substantial\nallocare. Of those who provide care, related children (4\nto 17 years of age) and adults (18 years and older), in-\ncluding fathers, spend around an hour a day providing\ninfant care. Unrelated caregivers, especially males, spend\nmuch less. Unrelated adult female allocaregivers, how-\never, spend on average 37 minutes a day engaged in al-\nlocare, and there is no significant difference between the\ntime contributions of unrelated nonreproductive and re-\nproductive caregivers. Figure 5 illustrates the distribu-\ntion of allocare across actual caregivers from the infant\u2019s\nperspective. Perhaps most notable, males, including fa-\nthers (11%), provide an average of 46% of allocare re-\nceived by infants, and unrelated adult females contribute\nnearly 20%. Children account for 56% of allocare. While\nthe time contribution per caregiver often may be low,\nthe cumulative time in allocare received by Efe infants\nis remarkably high.\nTime is a global measure of investment; however, the\nmultifaceted demands of infant care present varying\ncosts to the caregiver. A second measure of the cost of\ncare can be inferred from the nature of caregiving. Many\nforms of child care preclude or circumscribe participa-\ntion by the caregiver in other activities, such as main-\ntenance and economic tasks, travel, and attention to\nother children. Active care behaviors, such as feeding,\ngrooming, bathing, carrying, and comforting a fussing\nbaby, enlist a caregiver\u2019s attention and participation to\na greater degree than do physical contact (i.e., touching\nor holding) and social interaction (e.g., playing with and\ntalking to an infant) alone. Table 5 shows that while\nmothers on average spend over an hour per day feeding,\ngrooming, bathing, carrying, and comforting their in-\nfants, allocaregivers spend little time engaged in inten-\nsive infant care tasks.\nA final approach to the assessment of the potential\ncosts of allocare is the proportion of caregiver interac-\ntions that are performed simultaneously with economic\ntasks. While 23% of maternal infant care time is spent\nin simultaneous economic tasks, including household\nmaintenance activities, manufacturing, water and fire-\nwood collection, food acquisition, and food processing\n(totaling over an hour of maternal time co-occurring with\ndirect infant care), other caregivers spend very little time\nsimultaneously negotiating infant allocare with eco-\nnomic demands (table 5). Mothers are the most pressed\nfor time to complete economic tasks (Peacock 1985), and\nthe time and opportunity costs of allocare for other Efe\nappear to be low. Efe infant-allocaregiver interactions are\ncharacterized primarily by intermittent play and physi-\ncal contact rather than more demanding forms of care\nand are relatively free from the burden of simultaneous\neconomic tasks.\nEcological correlates. The diverse physical and social\ncontexts of Efe life present opportunities and constraints\nthat may be expected to facilitate or limit alloparenting.\nThere is remarkable consistency, however, in Efe allo-\ncare across demographic and physical settings. Group\nsize\u2014the number of camp members present during ob-\nservation\u2014approaches significance in predicting the\nnumber of caregivers that infants experience (p p .07)\nbut does not predict the amount of allocare they receive.\nThere is no relation between allocaregiving time and sea-\nson of observation (wet versus dry or clearing and plant-\ning versus peanut harvest, honey, or rainy), camp loca-\ntion (near horticultural villages versus an hour or more\u2019s\nwalk into the forest), or the demographic composition of\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n864 F current anthropology\nFig. 6.

As reported above, care by both\nmale and female siblings is negatively associated with\nthe presence of other dependents in the family. Surpris-\ningly, there is no difference in the amount of allocare\nreceived by infants with and without siblings (no sibs n\np 6, mean p 46%; with sibs n p 14, mean p 39%).\nPaternal infant care is predicted only by siblings in the\nfamily older than five years of age (Mann-Whitney U, p\n! .05), whose presence is negatively related to the\namount of time fathers give care, and an absence of sib-\nlings in the infant\u2019s family is associated with care by\nnonreproductive women (chi-square 4.615, p p .0317).\nIt appears that when parents lack kin to help, unrelated\ncaregivers are recruited. The number of unrelated allo-\ncaregivers is negatively associated with the number of\nrelatives available (i.e., in proximity) to an infant (p !\n.05, r2 p .30). Such assistance makes a difference to\nmothers: Mothers spend more time working when not\nengaged in infant care (p ! .05), and nearly half of the\nvariation in maternal care is explained by variation in\nthe number of allocaregivers (p ! .001, r2 p .49) (fig. 6).\nThere is some indication that alloparenting benefits Efe\ninfants as well: the number of allocaregivers at one year\nof age is positively associated with survivorship at three\nyears of age (survivors\u2019 [n p 15] mean p 10.8 allocare-\ngivers; nonsurvivors\u2019 [n p 5] mean p 6.2 allocaregivers\n[Mann-Whitney U, p p .05; logistic regression log like-\nlihood 28.410, chi-square 3.394, p p .0653, odds ratio p\n.664]). No other demographic or behavioral variable mea-\nsured predicts infant survivorship.\nconclusion\nThe extensive social distribution of Efe infant care and\nthe lack of impact of physical or demographic setting on\nthe amount of allocare that infants receive suggests a\nhighly flexible child-rearing system that recruits the di-\nverse investment interests of relatives and nonreproduc-\ntive individuals, especially adult females and children,\nfacultatively in a low-cost, potentially high-benefit en-\ndeavor. When the investigator queried a caregiver, \u201cWho\ncares for Efe infants?\u201d she responded matter-of-factly:\n\u201cAll of us.\u201d While this descriptor paints too communal\na picture of Efe infant care (on average about one-third\nof camp members are related to the infant, about half\nprovide infant care, and mothers remain responsible for\na slim majority of direct care of one-year-olds), it does\nreflect a confluence of social interests in the care of\nyoung. These data are consistent with previous analyses\nof Efe care of young infants (e.g., Tronick, Morelli, and\nWinn 1987, Winn 1991) and older children (e.g., Morelli\n1987, Tronick, Morelli, and Ivey 1992).2 Efe child-rearing\ndemonstrates the central role of human life history and\nsocial ecology in providing the opportunity for multiple\nmodes of cooperation in parenting, including nepotism,\nreciprocity, and learning-to-mother. The suggested lack\nof significant costs of alloparenting among the Efe re-\nduces the theoretical demand of finding its compensa-\ntion, and mutualism, whereby individuals gain greater\nbenefit by acting together than alone (see Wrangham\n1982), may best characterize Efe allocare. With the ex-\nception of a number of reproductive-age females without\nyoung, the demographic profile of an Efe allocaregiver is\nmuch like what could be found in any small foraging\n2. The study sampling methodology was developed to take advan-\ntage of technology allowing real-time data calculation, as well as\nscan-sampling, and was designed to overlap age-ranges of previous\nresearch conducted on neonates-to-4-month-olds (Tronick, Morelli,\nand Winn 1987, Winn 1991) and one-, two-, and three-year-olds\n(Morelli 1987, 1997; Tronick, Morelli, and Ivey 1992). Therefore,\nthis research replicates previous work employing different data col-\nlection techniques. While somewhat different measures are created\nfor theoretical purposes, the results are consistent both within sub-\njects measured across time (only one age period of which is reported\nin this study) and across subjects used in different data collection\nperiods. (For example, Morelli [1987] and Tronick, Morelli, and Ivey\n[1992] found that mothers were socially engaged with one-year-olds\n49% of observed time [n p 6] versus 51% in this later sample [n\np 20].) Although children\u2019s experience of care changes over time\nfrom infancy through three years of age (see Tronick, Morelli, and\nIvey 1992), internal consistency is demonstrated by measures of\nthe same subjects at different ages. An overlapping sample of sub-\njects in this study was observed at 5 months (n p 6) and 8 months\n(n p 11). The percentage of observed time that infants were engaged\nwith adults is 17.6% at 5 months, 15.9% at 8 months, and 16% at\n12 months. These infants interacted with children 29.1% of ob-\nserved time at 5 months, 23.3% at 8 months, and 27% of the time\nat 12 months. It is also of note that the narrow range of subject age\nmaximizes the sensitivity of the coding system and resultant data\nto the caregiving demands of specific developmental periods.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 865\npopulation: All human groups are composed of females,\nrelatives, and nonreproductive members, including chil-\ndren and postreproductive adults, begging the question\nof the uniqueness of Efe allocare. Efe allocare is neither\ncommunalistic nor entirely nepotistic, and values con-\ncerning infants do little to explain the pattern of\ncaregiving.\nThe life history and ecology of the Efe hold clues that\nproductive as well as reproductive constraints facilitate\nallocare by affecting the access that individuals have to\nfood and social resources. Time allocation data (Bailey\nand Peacock 1988, Peacock 1985, Ivey 1993) and focal\ninterviews (Ivey 1993) suggest that Efe mothers face con-\nsiderable demands in provisioning their families. Be-\ncause Efe children are nutritionally stressed (Bailey\n1991b) but able to gather little in the way of food for\nthemselves (Ivey, Morelli, and Tronick 1994, Morelli\n1997), they may defray some of the costs of parental\nprovisioning by performing tasks that increase adult ec-\nonomic efficiency (see Blurton Jones 1993). Mothers are\nrelieved of competing child-care demands to engage in\nsubsistence activities from which children and others\nbenefit. In addition, high rates of mortality and infertility\nrender access to kin low or unpredictable for many Efe,\nbut the reliance on social relationships for success in\neconomic and reproductive activities is high (Bailey\n1991a). The development of diverse social ties through\nallocaregiving may enhance the probability of future co-\noperation (Morelli and Tronick 1991, Ivey 1993), which\nhas especially important long-term benefits in an envi-\nronment of unpredictable (i.e., high-variance) access to\nresources (Low 1988). The role of child-care aid in co-\noperative reproduction remains underexamined, and\nthese data suggest that among some foragers low-cost\nassistance may moderate the quality-quantity tradeoff of\nparental investment. Alloparenting therefore has impor-\ntant developmental and reproductive consequences with\nimplications for the evolution of human life history.\nReferences Cited\na l t m a n n , j . 1974.

On the\npositive side, it has helped open up a fresh approach to\nthis aspect of art by providing some valuable insights as\nto its probable derivation. On the negative side, it leaves\nopen certain questions relating to cultures in which sha-\nmanism is known to be absent but the same or similar\nmotifs are apparent. How is the persistence of analogous\nmotifs in such cultures to be explained? There is also\nthe problem of the growing accumulation and antiquity\nof geometric motifs dating to the Lower and Middle\nPalaeolithic.\nAlthough relying on the neurophysiological model as\nthe underlying mechanism responsible for geometric\nmark-making, recent commentators, including Lewis-\nWilliams and Dowson, have remained reticent as to the\nexact nature of the proposed cerebral component. This\nis surprising given that a detailed understanding of this\nmechanism could provide important insights as to how\nearly marks might have arisen and that recent research\nconcerning the visual cortex has provided a substantial\namount of hard scientific data for analysis in this con-\ntext. To rely on a neurophysiological model without any\nattempt at specifying the nature of the primary agent\nconcerned involves a substantial leap of faith. This paper\npresents important evidence for a more profound, per-\nvasive explanation for early abstract geometric art based\nupon recent neurophysiological research and a detailed\ndescription of the mechanisms involved.\nquestions raised by the neurophysiological\napproach\nWe can be sure, as Lewis-Williams (1991:153) points out,\nthat the neurophysiology of the visual cortex of Palaeo-\nlithic hominids is the same as that of modern humans\nand this is more than likely the source of geometric phos-\nphenes (see below for further confirmation), but we can-\nnot be so sure that such hominids engaged in shaman-\nistic activities (Bahn and Vertut 1997:182). Moreover,\neven if this were the case, as is suggested by examples\nsuch as the horses at Pech Merle, France, it would not\nexplain the full spectrum of Palaeolithic art, figurative\nor abstract. Given the appearance in the Lower and Mid-\ndle Palaeolithic of a growing corpus of simple lines and\ngeometric phosphene-like motifs (e.g., Bednarik 1995,\nMarshack 1996) lacking any representational content,\nthe argument put forward by Lewis-Williams and Dow-\nson (that iconic components arise, in stages, out of phos-\nphenes as a function of shamanistic practices) would pre-\ndict that representational features should also be present\nin the \u201cart\u201d of this period. Considering the existence of\niconic sculptural objects in this earlier phase (Bahn and\nVertut 1997:24, 99\u2013100), the question arises why there\nare no representational features associated with the pre-\nvailing geometric forms and why abstract geometric\nprimitives seem to predate the representational art of the\nUpper Palaeolithic by a considerable period.\nthe significance of phosphene theory\nBednarik (1984, 1986, 1990) has proposed phosphene the-\nory as a sufficient explanation for the existence of simple\ngeometric motifs in Lower Palaeolithic art\u2014through the\n\u201cexternalization\u201d of phosphenes by mark-making. Phos-\nphenes have also been implicated as the underlying fac-\ntor in geometric \u201cprimitive\u201d art by Siegel (1980:131\u201332)\nand in the abstract forms of Neolithic art by various\ncommentators (Kellogg, Knoll, and Kugler 1965, Bradley\n1989, Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1993, Dronfield\n1995).\nThe appeal to phosphenes by Lewis-Williams and\nDowson is based upon the commonality of neurophy-\nsiological structures of the visual system across various\ncultural domains and the fact that such phosphenes can\nbe actuated through induced trance states (Lewis-Wil-\nliams and Dowson 1988, Dronfield 1996). Iconic features\nare said to arise out of geometric primitives in three\nstages (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988:203\u20134; Siegel\n1980:125, 127, 130), as if representational form were be-\ning constructed out of basic phosphene elements, thus\nproviding a kind of mental template for the realization\nof depictive form the exact nature of which depends,\nultimately, on existing cultural parameters\u2014in this case\nshamanic norms.\nThe trance states of shamanism are, however, but one\nmeans by which phosphenes can be experienced. The\nshamanistic theory has, accordingly, been criticized by\nBednarik (1990), as cultures which are not shamanistic\nor do not resort to hallucinatorily derived experiences\nare also found to have phosphene-like motifs in their art\n(p. 79). Furthermore, Dronfield (1995:539; 1996), al-\nthough providing some support for Lewis-Williams and\nDowson\u2019s main thesis, still questions the explanatory\npower of the model for reasons similar to Bednarik\u2019s.\nAlong with Kellogg (Kellogg, Knoll, and Kugler 1965),\nBednarik believes that phosphenes are a fundamental\nuniversal of early art (p. 77), that all humans experience\nthem including infants and the blind (p. 78), and that\ntheir causes may be multiple. For example, Bahn and\nVertut (1997:182) have pointed out that hallucinogen- or\ntrance-induced phosphenes account for only a small pro-\nportion of such experiences; isolation, extreme boredom,\nnocturnal hallucinations, drowsiness, sleep deprivation,\netc., can produce similar subjective manifestations. Sim-\nilarly, Bednarik (1986:165) has suggested that for Euro-\npean cave dwellers prolonged deprivation of light during\nsevere winters or dietary privation could equally be the\ncause of phosphene experience. This points the way to\na possible deeper explanation for the existence of phos-\nphene-like motifs in art and ways of accounting for the\nexperience of phosphenes other than by shamanism\nalone.\nIn view of the manifest correspondence between early\ngeometric art and phosphenes, the question arises\nwhether there is any evidence for a direct causal rela-\ntionship between them.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n868 F current anthropology\nthe neurophysiological site of phosphenes\nThat the central nervous system or the visual cortex are\nresponsible for the manifestation of phosphenes seems\nto be accepted (Siegel 1980:132: Kellogg, Knoll, and Ku-\ngler 1965:1130; Bednarik 1990:78); Lewis-Williams and\nDowson 1988:202). Evidence designating the visual cor-\ntex as the locus of phosphene experience comes from\nmigraine sufferers. Siegel, Murray, and Jarvis (1975) sug-\ngest that geometric forms derived from visual images of\nthose suffering migraine attacks provide information on\nthe lattice arrangements of detector cells in the visual\ncortex.\nKnoll and Kugler (1959), along with Penfield and Rob-\nerts (1959), have found phosphenes arising when either\nthe temporal part of the brain or the visual cortex was\ndirectly stimulated by electrical impulses. Moreover,\nDobelle and Mladejovski (1974) report that only stimu-\nlation of the primary visual cortex (pp. 559 and 560) in\nconscious patients produced phosphenes (either round or\nshort line shapes [p. 567]), and Brindley and Lewin (1968)\nfound that stimulation of the same area by several elec-\ntrodes simultaneously led to the perception of various\npredictable patterns. Dobelle et al. (1976) report on a\nprosthesis consisting of electrodes inserted into the pri-\nmary visual cortex connected to a television camera\nwhich allowed a blind person to detect horizontal and\nvertical lines so that they were able to recognize simple\nletters and patterns (p. 111).\nTootell et al. (1998) have, in addition, confirmed, by\nfunctional analysis of the primary visual cortex using\nmagnetic resonance imaging, that this area has lower\ncontrast-sensitivity\u2014in other words, it is more sensitive\nto visual phenomena such as lines\u2014as well as being ori-\nentation-selective (pp. 815\u201316). Kosslyn et al. (1999), us-\ning the same technique, in addition to verifying this con-\nclusion have found a direct causal link between the\nprimary visual cortex and the perception of lines by ask-\ning subjects to imagine sets of stripes of various orien-\ntations rather than merely viewing such stimuli. Fur-\nthermore, it has been established that damage to the\nprimary visual cortex leads to an inability to copy the\nsimplest geometric forms and, moreover, that in cases\nwhere the primary visual cortex is intact but there has\nbeen a lesion to other areas of the visual cortex the sub-\nject is able to draw local elements of form such as angles,\nsimple lines, and shapes but is unable to integrate such\nlines into a complex whole (Zeki 1992:48 and 49).\nSuch studies, and particularly Zeki\u2019s observations, all\neither implicate or directly confirm the primary visual\ncortex as the underlying neurophysiological causative\nfactor in the perception and depiction of simple lines and\nphosphene-like forms as well as phosphenes themselves.\nthe importance of lines and the primary\nvisual cortex\nFurther support for the primary visual cortex as the seat\nof the phosphene\/artistic primitive forms comes from\nthe way in which line is processed at this level. Line\ndrawings are universally exploited as a short cut to rep-\nresentation by infants, hunter-gatherers, contemporary\nartists, and, at preliminary pre-representation stages,\neven chimpanzees (Kennedy and Silver 1974, Davis 1986,\nCavanagh 1995, Latto 1995, Morris 1967). Why should\nthis be the case?\nGombrich (1973:201), Bednarik (1984), Halverson\n(1992), Latto (1995), and Hudson (1998:98) represent only\na few of those who have emphasized that artistic prim-\nitive motifs are aesthetically interesting not because\nthey reflect properties of the world but because they sim-\nulate properties of the visual system. Latto (pp. 67\u201368),\nin particular, has explored this idea in some detail:\nA form is effective because it relates to the proper-\nties of the human visual system. To describe this\nprocess I have coined the term \u201caesthetic primi-\ntive,\u201d which, using \u201cprimitive\u201d in the sense of pri-\nmary or fundamental, is defined as a stimulus or\nproperty of a stimulus that is intrinsically interest-\ning, even in the absence of narrative meaning, be-\ncause it resonates with the mechanisms of the vi-\nsual system processing it.\nLatto has also established that this can be applied to a\nrange of artistic traditions by demonstrating that partic-\nular graphic depictive strategies can be understood in\nterms of precise neurophysiological processes. Davis\n(1986:196), discussing Palaeolithic art, has, in addition,\ndrawn attention to the fact that representation is a spe-\ncialized process in that it is a reduction or decomposition\nof human vision.\nThis approach has received corroboration from Hubel\nand Wiesel\u2019s (1980) discovery that cells in the primary\nvisual cortex are organized to respond to the specific\norientation of a line and that perception may be fabri-\ncated from the accretion of selected features. This is a\nconcept which is crucially important for an appreciation\nof how the neurophysiological model proposed by Lewis-\nWilliams and Dowson can be extended to include the\nmany exceptions already referred to as well as to explain\nhow iconic forms arise out of phosphenes.\nHubel and Wiesel go on to describe how the primary\nvisual cortex may function as an early stage in the brain\u2019s\nanalysis of line orientation and an important aspect of\nthe processing of visual information through recourse to\na hierarchy of simple, complex, and hypercomplex cells\nby which the nature of information concerned with line\nmay become more abstract. Barlow\u2019s (1972) feature-de-\ntection theory is an extension of Hubel and Wiesel\u2019s anal-\nysis which proposes that cortical cells forming the bot-\ntom layer of a hierarchy of cells respond progressively\nto more and more abstract geometric features. Hence,\ncells in lower levels might respond to primitive line com-\nponents while higher layers respond to simple geomet-\nrical patterns such as angles, defined by the activities of\nparticular combinations of complex and hypercomplex\ncells, leading to the perception of yet more elaborate\nfeatures, such as rectangles and circles, and so on up to\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 869\nrepresentational figures\u2014the latter concerning higher-\norder centres of the visual cortex and the brain. Although\nthis is a simplification of a very involved process which\nis still not fully understood, recent neurophysiological\nevidence has tended to confirm this picture by demon-\nstrating how the primary visual cortex processes line\norientation, angles, and \u201cT\u201d junctions (Gilbert 1998, Das\nand Gilbert 1999; see Eysel 1999 for a useful summary).\nMarr (1976), in accord with this analysis, has dem-\nonstrated that a visual processing model (leading to what\nhe calls the \u201craw primal sketch\u201d) beginning with the\nextraction of essential edge features as necessary com-\nponents of line drawing can account for the efficiency of\nsuch drawings in depicting representation and carrying\na great deal of information. This may explain why early\nhumans began preferentially with an investigation of the\npossibilities inherent in the use of line, eventually lead-\ning to the artistic equivalent of Marr\u2019s \u201craw primal\nsketch,\u201d akin to the outline figures of animals in the\nUpper Palaeolithic (Halverson 1992:389 and 402). It ap-\npears that early humans, in making the first crude marks\nduring the Lower to Middle Palaeolithic (if Bednarik\u2019s\nanalysis [1995] is to be accepted), may have been extract-\ning one particularly significant aspect of the optical array\nfor possible exploitation, beginning with the analysis of\nparts of form in terms of line and line orientation (Hubel\nand Weisel 1980:36\u201337) the wiring of which in the pri-\nmary visual cortex is genetically determined (p. 38). The\nvertical, horizontal, tilted, circular, zigzag, and lattice\nlines typical of the Lower-Middle Palaeolithic (Bednarik\n1995) would indicate this early processing, the \u201cman-\ndala\u201d motif (from Tata, Hungary [p. 610]) being especially\ndefinitive in embodying such diverse features and con-\nstituting the probable limit of visual analysis in terms\nof Gestalt principles at the level of the primary visual\ncortex (see below). Given enough time, a sufficient \u201cvo-\ncabulary\u201d of marks would eventually have accumulated\nto produce the first realistic drawings found in the Upper\nPalaeolithic, congruent with the way in which the visual\ncortex is thought to produce a \u201crepresentational image\u201d\n(much as Barlow\u2019s feature-detection theory and Marr\u2019s\nanalysis suggest). Abstract geometric components deriv-\ning from this dynamic continued to be common in the\nUpper Palaeolithic and would also have appealed to Ne-\nolithic artists, as the same mechanism indigenous to the\nprimary visual cortex would have been involved\u2014which,\nincidentally, explains the evident but perplexing univer-\nsality of such forms, as specified by Forbes and Crowder\n(1979).\nAnother \u201cdeconstructive\u201d aspect of visual processing\nrelevant to the origins of art concerning the primary vi-\nsual cortex is the separate but parallel processing of dif-\nferent kinds of visual information (Livingstone and Hu-\nbel 1987). There are, generally speaking, at lower levels,\ntwo broad divisions known as the magno system, which\ncarries information about luminance contrast, and the\nparvo system, which relays information concerning col-\nour\u2014a division which becomes more complex and elab-\norate in the primary visual cortex and higher-order cen-\ntres of the visual cortex. At the level of the primary visual\ncortex the magno system analyses signals for depth, mo-\ntion, and global form perception, while the parvo system\nsplits into the \u201cblob\u201d pathway, for the analysis of colour,\nand the \u201cinterblob\u201d pathway, for the high resolution of\nstatic form perception. The magno system as a visual\nchannel includes decisions about which elements, such\nas edges, figure and ground, and discontinuities, belong\nto individual objects in the scene as specified by Gestalt\ntheory (Livingstone and Hubel 1995:61\u201364) and, conse-\nquently, is concerned with the overall organization of\nthe visual world. The parvo-interblob system seems to\nbe more important for analysing the scene in much\ngreater detail. It would not be surprising, therefore, to\nfind that the more primitive magno system is engaged\nin the essential functions which enable an animal to\nnavigate in its environment, catch prey, and avoid pred-\nators while the parvo-interblob system, which is well\ndeveloped in primates, adds the ability to scrutinize more\nclosely the shape and surface properties of an ob-\nject\u2014and, accordingly, this system seems well suited to\nvisual identification and association (p. 64). The percep-\ntion of form would have been critical for survival and,\nover time, specifically selected for, which could explain\nwhy line components figured so prominently in early\nmark-making.\nThus, different aspects of a painting are processed by\ndifferent regions of the visual cortex (Livingstone 1988;\nZeki 1993:355). The \u201cartists\u201d of the Lower and Middle\nPalaeolithic, in producing simple repetitive lines and\ngeometric primitives, were therefore, at the level of the\nprimary visual cortex, probably appealing to the parvo-\ninterblob pathway. The evolutionarily earlier magno sys-\ntem would, however, have been significant at levels of\nthe visual cortex beyond the primary centre (involving\nseparate functional \u201cunits,\u201d e.g., V2, V3, V4, which have\nlarger receptive fields and are more tolerant to line ori-\nentation, and reentrant processing) for combining and\nintegrating detail into a structured whole. In view of this\nanalysis it is hardly surprising that animal outlines occur\nso often in Upper Palaeolithic art, as perceptual analysis\nof such forms through the magno and parvo pathways\nwould have had important consequences for the iden-\ntification of a potential threat or possible food source.\nColour was a subsidiary element added to Upper Pa-\nlaeolithic art (Halverson 1992:390), probably as a con-\nsequence of the later-evolved parvo-blob\/V4 axis.\nThe obvious similarity between phosphenes and ab-\nstract motifs in Lower, Middle, and Upper Palaeolithic\nart and Neolithic geometric decorative forms, the prob-\nability that the primary visual cortex is the locus for\nphosphenes, and the importance of the processing of line\nby the primary visual cortex support the idea that this\npart of the brain is a common predisposing neurophy-\nsiological factor. It is therefore the structure and mor-\nphology of the primary visual cortex which can account\nfor the particular form of phosphenes, whether the mech-\nanism producing them is the trance states of shamanism,\ndrug-induced hallucinations, migraine attacks, or elec-\ntrophysical intervention.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n870 F current anthropology\nan alternative explanation for early mark-\nmaking\nThe question then arises how pre\u2013Upper Palaeolithic and\nPalaeolithic geometric marks are to be explained if sha-\nmanism is unable to account for their preponderance but\nfor exceptional instances in the later period. Given that\nthe universality of the visual neurophysiology is widely\naccepted, we can agree that the Lower and Middle Pa-\nlaeolithic marks may resemble phosphenes but their\nprincipal source was not the attempted rendition of phos-\nphenes themselves or the altered states of shamanism\nbut the practice of or preoccupation with mark-making\nitself. Engagement in a visually creative act is said to\nproduce a hyperreality experience akin to that produced\nby trance or drug inducement in that the artist is in a\nstate of focused awareness detached from the outside\nworld (Bahn and Vertut 1997:182). Furthermore, a hyp-\nnotic trance can be induced by having the subject focus\nintently on entoptic phenomena (Hunchak 1980). As\nDissanayake (1992:84) suggests, \u201cthe production and rep-\netition of geometric shapes . . . seems to be a fundamental\npsychobiological propensity in humans that provides\npleasurable feelings of mastery, security, and relief from\nanxiety.\u201d Berlyne (1960) has proposed that engagement\nin such activity produces pleasure, leading to an optimal\nlevel of arousal through a feedback loop, and Arnheim\n(1971:251) has suggested that the economical use of\nshape and the discovery of similarity are part of a search\nfor order and structure in a complex world\u2014a process in\nwhich, I submit, the primary visual cortex has played a\npreeminent role.\nInfant drawing begins, spontaneously, around two\nyears of age, with simple repetitive lines that evolve into\nmore complex geometric motifs (Kellogg 1970) similar\nto phosphenes (Kellogg, Knoll, and Kugler 1965) from\nwhich the first representational forms arise by about\nthree years of age. Lewis-Williams (1991:158) makes the\nmistake of discounting child art with reference to any\naspect of Palaeolithic art (he completely misunderstands\nBednarik [1990:77] on this issue [Lewis-Williams 1990:\n81]). In terms of the particular iconic elements realized\nthis may be admissible, but it is not with regard to the\npre-representational geometric forms or the stages\nwhereby representation emerges from such forms. The\nsequence in infant mark-making parallels the way in\nwhich iconic features arise out of phosphenes in drug-\ninduced states. Both sequences, I argue, are contingent\non the same neurophysiological mechanism\u2014the pri-\nmary visual cortex (for phosphenes and phosphene-like\ngeometric marks) and, subsequently, other areas of the\nvisual cortex for outline contours of representational fig-\nures. The first primitive marks of the Lower and Middle\nPalaeolithic can therefore be regarded as a prerequisite\nfor the realization of representational form, a process also\nseen in the similar universal, sequential development\namong infants and the emerging iconic features of in-\nduced shamanistic states. The difference lies primarily\nin the rapid access to the underlying neurophysiology in\nthe case of shamanism as compared with the gradual\nrealization through \u201clearning\u201d (i.e., the approximation\nof self-sufficient marks) afforded to pre\u2013Upper Palaeo-\nlithic hominids. Justification for this comes not only\nfrom the way in which the visual cortex functions but\nalso from the fact that ontogeny tends to follow phylog-\neny and the evolutionarily mediated incremental move-\nment from the simple to the complex (as in infant draw-\ning [Arnheim 1974, Slater 1996]) in the same way as\nspeech is thought to have evolved gradually toward\ngreater complexity over a considerable period (Deacon\n1989, Pinker 1994). This thesis is additionally supported\nby the fact that chimpanzees spontaneously (i.e., without\nany reward) produce simple repetitive lines leading,\neventually, to more complex geometric designs up to the\n\u201cdiagram\u201d stage (Morris 1967:138\u201339), equivalent to\nthose of a two-and-a-half-year-old child.\nThis analysis explains the exclusive existence of geo-\nmetric marks in the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic and,\nmoreover, the persistence of such marks alongside of\nrepresentation in the Upper Palaeolithic, as children also\ntend to refer back to earlier geometric forms even after\nthe representational stage has been attained (Golomb\n1981).\nFor both infants and early humans the preoccupation\nwith mark-making is an important stimulus for the eye\nand the brain, helping to promote vital survival skills\nsuch as visual memory and perceptual awareness and to\nimprove hand-eye coordination, particularly fine motor\nskills mediated through the parvo-interblob pathway.\nGregory (1970:42) has remarked that vision develops in\nchildren through the touching of objects. Similarly, Al-\nland (1983) has argued that \u201cart\u201d results from the inter-\naction of behavioural systems such as exploration and\nplay, which foster understanding of the environment, re-\nsponse to form, which increases awareness of the envi-\nronment, and fine-grained perception and perceptual\nmemory, which increase the capacity to deal with en-\nvironmental variation and to exploit resources. Of\ncourse, as already intimated, such skills would involve\nother areas of the brain, such as the arousal system, in-\ncluding higher-order associative functions as part of an\nactive-\u201cpassive\u201d feedback loop, the primary visual cortex\nconstituting the crucial nexus for geometric forms.\nThis model has been vindicated by a recent study using\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (the Wellcome\nTrust Sci-Art Project; see New Scientist, December 5,\n1988), which establishes that artistically naive subjects\ncopying geometric figures experience increased activity\nin the visual cortex while trained artists show more ac-\ntivity in the right frontal regions of the brain, indicating\nthat the former are slavishly copying the presenting\nstimulus while the latter are using higher-order func-\ntions because of previous training. Hominids involved\nin mark-making during the Lower and Middle Palaeo-\nlithic would, hence, be akin to untrained subjects \u201clearn-\ning\u201d how to make simple lines by recourse to positive\nfeedback involving activation of the visual cortex, and\nin view of the neurophysiological studies already cited\nthis is more than likely to have been the primary visual\ncortex.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 871\nthe importance of gestalt theory\nIt is significant that Marr\u2019s ideas made extensive use of\nGestalt principles of perceptual organization whereby\ndiscrete elements are deemed more likely to \u201cbelong to-\ngether\u201d by having a similar orientation or lying next to\none another than those oriented dissimilarly and spaced\nfar apart (Bruce and Green 1990). Siegel (1980:131), sim-\nilarly, argues that not only straight-line figures but\ncurved ones can be subdivided into straight lines, since\nthe direction of the curve can be defined by the orien-\ntation of its tangent\u2014circular as well as straight lines\nare therefore possible. The Quneitra artifact (ca. 54,000\nb.p. [Marshack 1996]) seems to illustrate the importance\nof this in early mark-making, as do other similar geo-\nmetric motifs before and during this period. Earlier\nLower Palaeolithic marks such as cupules, spots, dashes,\nand various arrangements of peck marks, when repeated\nand strung together, can, in accordance with Gestalt\nprinciples, also form the basis of concomitant straight\nor curved lines as a preliminary to the depiction of lines,\nangles, and squares or circles (i.e., through the laws of\ncontinuity, closure, and symmetry, respectively) and\neventually to a combination of such forms (e.g., a rec-\ntangular design from Bilzingsleben, Germany, ca.\n100,000 b.p. and other similar geometric motifs [Bed-\nnarik 1995]). Many of the simple geometric shapes com-\nmon to the proto-art of early hominids and Neolithic art\ncan be similarly explained in terms of the way in which\nperceptual information concerned with line is processed\nand assimilated graphically in terms of Gestalt theory at\nthe level of the primary visual cortex. It should be noted,\nhowever, that it is the structure and topography of the\nneurophysiology relating to the primary visual cortex\nwhich determine the Gestalt principles, probably by re-\ncourse to inhibitory and excitatory axons involving\nshort-range and long-range connections within the fabric\nof the primary visual cortex (Das and Gilbert 1999) and\nreentrant processing (Zeki 1992:50).\nevolution and the primary visual cortex\nThe primary visual cortex in primates plays a critical\nrole in visual information processing, as most visual in-\nformation reaching the rest of the visual cortex is fun-\nnelled through this area (Felleman and Van Essen 1991).\nThis \u201cgatekeeper\u201d role may account for this area\u2019s being\nthe largest known visual cortical if not the largest cor-\ntical area (Tootell et al. 1998). The primary visual cortex\nis regarded as pivotal in this context because it is the\none area of the visual cortex which seems to be mature\nat birth (Zeki 1992:44) and, together with V2, a feed-\nforward centre, is common to all mammals (Allman\n1987:637), which underlines its evolutionary signifi-\ncance. Furthermore, the magno system, as well as being\nmore primitive than the parvo, may be regarded as ho-\nmologous to the entire visual system of non-primate\nmammals (Livingstone and Hubel 1995:64) and a pre-\ncursor to the parvo-interblob pathway (as indicated by\nthe aforementioned redundancy). Consequently, in view\nof research with contemporaneous subjects which has\nestablished the primary visual cortex\u2019s preeminence in\nthe perception of line and form and given the evolution-\nary imperatives, this part of the brain, through com-\nmonality, would have been equally if not more important\nfor hominids engaged in early mark-making.\nThere is also evidence that Gestalt principles may be\ninnately mediated at the level of the primary visual cor-\ntex, additionally linking Gestalt theory with functional\ncorrelates at this level and reinforcing its importance in\nterms of evolutionary factors. Bower (1977:43) has dem-\nonstrated that two-month-old infants can respond to and\ntherefore perceive closure. More recently Slater (1996),\nin an overview of similar studies, confirms this finding\nand cites research which has discovered other corre-\nsponding elements of perception to be innately defined.\nThis is borne out by the work of Knoll and Kellogg (1965),\nwho, in attempting to explain their finding of a strong\nsimilarity between adult phosphenes and preschool chil-\ndren\u2019s scribblings, concluded that \u201cwe are dealing here\nwith the activation of pre-formed neurone networks in\nthe visual system\u201d (p. 1130).\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, then, it makes sense\nthat abstract marks should appear before representa-\ntional forms. Mark-making may be derived from the per-\nceptual processes pertaining to the primary visual cortex,\nthe latter having evolved, in conjunction with the eye,\nas a means of organizing and systematizing the incoming\nperceptual array for the purposes of survival. Simple geo-\nmetric scratches on rock surfaces would therefore con-\nstitute a recapitulation of the process by which the pri-\nmary visual cortex begins to construct a \u201cpicture\u201d of the\nworld from simple lines as a preliminary to more elab-\norate representational features, thus providing a more\npervasive explanation than Lewis-Williams and Dow-\nson\u2019s for the apparent emergence of iconic elements out\nof geometric primitives. Accordingly, shamanism is a\nnecessary but not a sufficient cause for such depictive\nmanifestations. This is, therefore, a model which both\nincludes Lewis-Williams and Dowson\u2019s thesis and em-\nbraces Bednarik\u2019s position concerning phosphene theory\nand neuropsychology.\nconclusion\nThe fact that the primary visual cortex plays a central\nrole in the initial processing of visual information con-\ncerned with line, its obvious connection with the process\nof making and viewing simple geometric marks, its ev-\nolutionary significance, its maturity at birth, and the\nfunctional characteristics which can explain the expe-\nrience of phosphenes and phosphene-like marks confirm\nthat it is fundamental for determining both the proto-\nart of early humans and subsequent geometric motifs.\nPrimitive marks then become the starting point for the\nassignment of form according to Gestalt principles (as\ndetermined by inherent neurophysiological structures)\nin the same way that the combining of such primitives\ninto basic configurations may well be determined at the\nlevel of the primary visual cortex.

Haas 1982), but Carneiro\u2019s (1970) \u201cA\nTheory of the Origin of the State\u201d produced a remarkable\nincrease in scholarly attention to the subject and stim-\nulated a great amount of research from a modern an-\nthropological perspective. Carneiro argues that state for-\nmation is a result of the interplay of three crucial\nelements: environmental circumscription, population\npressure, and warfare (1970:737; 1972:65; 1988:499). He\ngoes on to suggest that warfare oriented toward the con-\nquest of arable land, stimulated by population pressure\nin direct association with geographic circumscription, is\nthe only mechanism in the rise of state societies. He\ndoes not rule out the possibility of voluntaristic coop-\neration under particular conditions, but he considers it\ntemporary (1970:733; 1972:65). Although not all scholars\nagree with Carneiro\u2019s proposition, which has not yet\nbeen tested in a sophisticated way with empirical data,\nmany have contended that warfare in conjunction with\n1. q 2000 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological\nResearch. All rights reserved 0011-3204\/2000\/4105-0010$1.00.\npopulation growth was a significant evolutionary mech-\nanism, in particular, for state formation (Cohen 1984;\nHaas 1982, 1984, 1990; Jochim 1979, 1981; Kirch 1988;\nSanders and Price 1968; Schacht 1988; Spencer 1982;\nWebb 1975, 1988; Webster 1975, 1976, 1977; Wright\n1978). Despite this, the theory continues to be\nchallenged.\nSome scholars reject warfare as a primary cause of state\nformation, arguing that large military conflicts have been\na result of the development of complex societies rather\nthan a cause. Other criticisms are that warfare is con-\nsiderably older and more widespread than the state, that\nthe presence of warfare does not automatically bring\nabout state formation, and that Carneiro\u2019s (1970) defi-\nnition of circumscription is equivocal and relative\n(Schacht 1988). Furthermore, even if there were many\nenvironmentally circumscribed environments with large\npopulations and evidence of conflict, there is still the\ncase of the Polynesian islands (Kirch 1984:207\u201316; 1988),\nwhere state-level societies never emerged. Why did pre-\nhistoric people(s) who had controlled their population\nbelow the carrying capacity of the limited land supply\nlet it grow so large as to cause conflicts over arable land\n(Redman 1978:225)? If warfare arose because of the lack\nof arable land in direct association with overpopulation,\nunless the winners killed all the losers the fundamental\nproblem\u2014the shortage of arable land (i.e., lack of\nfood)\u2014would have remained unsolved. This scenario of\npopulation growth in a circumscribed territory may work\nfor the emergence of social stratification in a given re-\ngion, but it does not necessarily work everywhere.\nThus, although warfare theory has played a significant\nrole in the explanation of the emergence of state-level\nsocieties, there are still many questions open to debate.\nIn this paper I will reexamine the correlation between\npopulation pressure and warfare in Chinese and Korean\nchronicles and examine alternative causative factors. In\nparticular, I will argue that in the Korean case warfare\ntook place not because of population pressure in relation\nto arable land and food shortage but in order to obtain\nlabor to produce more foods, goods, and services in re-\nsponse to environmental stress.\ndemographic dynamics and warfare\nEvolutionary theorists have emphasized the correlation\nbetween population pressure in circumscribed environ-\nments and the emergence of the state. In particular, ec-\nological anthropologists have emphasized that popula-\ntion growth in conjunction with a shortage of arable land\n(i.e., insufficient subsistence resources), followed by in-\ntercommunity competition, was the principal mecha-\nnism of the sociocultural change leading to the emer-\ngence of the state (Carneiro 1970, 1988; Ferguson 1984;\n1990:31\u201333; Harner 1970:68; Harris 1971:227\u201328; 1972;\n1979:102\u2013103; Johnson and Earle 1987:16\u201318; Larson\n1972; Sanders and Price 1968:230\u201332; Webster 1975). Ac-\ncording to Vayda (1974:183), however, \u201cwar occurs even\nwhen appreciable population pressure is absent and\nwhen none of the belligerents either needs or seeks more\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n874 F current anthropology\nFig. 1. The location of the Sam Han in southern\nKorea.\nland or other resources.\u201d Other researchers have also pro-\nposed that population growth in conjunction with lim-\nited subsistent resources may be the principal cause of\nwarfare, but war is not necessarily always caused solely\nor mainly by such pressure (Brumfiel 1983:270; Cowgill\n1975:517; 1979:58\u201360; Dumond 1972:310; Gibson 1974;\nVayda 1974:184). It also has been pointed out that pop-\nulation growth cannot account for the entire course of\nhistory, since it must be assumed that other processes\nare also at work in any given case (Dumond 1972:309;\nHarner 1970:68). Also, war may occur \u201cas a corrective\nresponse to problems not of overpopulation but of un-\nderpopulation\u201d (Vayda 1974:184). That is,\nAutonomous local groups are small enough in much\nof the primitive world to be subject to considerable\nfluctuations in size, sex ratio, and age distribution as\na result of chance variations in natality and mortal-\nity; it has been noted that some such groups, as, for\nexample, some Indian groups in central Brazil, com-\npensate for the effect of these variations by resorting\nto warfare that involves taking captives belonging to\nappropriate age and sex categories.\nCowgill (1979:59\u201360) has argued almost the same view:\nIt seems quite clear that conflict did not escalate be-\ncause of growing population pressure or subsistence\nproblems. On the contrary, rulers of states often felt\nthat their states were underpopulated. They needed\npeople as conscripts for the huge armies, and they\nalso needed people to intensify agricultural produc-\ntion in order to feed the huge armies during their\nlong campaigns. Some rulers adopted policies explic-\nitly intended to encourage population growth, and\nrulers also attempted to induce peasants to flee from\nother states. . .\nRedmond (1994) also finds that, among the Yanomamo\u00a8\nand J\u0131\u00b4varo in northern South America, tribal warfare is\nmotivated by the desire for looting valuables, abducting\nwomen, and taking revenge rather than the desire for\nsubsistence resources. Similar cases in South America\nhave been observed by many others (Chagnon 1983:\n170\u201389; Helms 1994; Johnson and Earle 1987:124, 134).\nThese examples strongly suggest that the relationship\nbetween population pressure and competition for arable\nland is not as strong as many have thought.\nThe Chinese chronicle San quo chi, compiled by Chen\nShou (1987) in the second half of the 3d century a.d., is\na good source of information on the political configu-\nrations, social structures, and economic patterns of the\nindependent aboriginal polities in southern Korea for a\ntime span of approximately 500 years from the 2d cen-\ntury b.c. to the end of the 3d century a.d. These auton-\nomous polities are collectively called the Sam (Three)\nHan: Ma Han, Jin Han, and Byun Han (fig. 1). The Sam\nHan consisted of 78 guks, the Chinese character for\nwhich literally means \u201cstates\u201d but which cannot be con-\nsidered state-level societies as Service defines them. All\nbut a few of them have been regarded as chiefdoms at\nmost. According to the San quo chi. Ma Han, the largest,\nconsisted of 54 guks located in the western and south-\nwestern portion of the Korean peninsula. Baekje, a polity\nlocated around the present-day city of Seoul, evolved into\nthe Baekje Kingdom. Jin Han consisted of 12 guks, lo-\ncated in the southeastern portion of the peninsula,\nlargely on the east side of the Nakdong River. Saro, a\npolity located in the present-day city of Gyungju, evolved\ninto the Silla Kingdom. Byun Han also consisted of 12\nguks, predominantly located on the west side of the Nak-\ndong River between Ma Han and Jin Han. In the Byun\nHan area, six of the polities evolved into at least maximal\nchiefdoms that were collectively called Gaya (fig. 2).\nThe San quo chi provides gross estimates of the dem-\nographics of a few polities of the Sam Han that allow us\nto assess the overall population size, distribution, and\ngrowth of the Silla Kingdom (i.e., Jin Han), from the 1st\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 875\nFig. 2.

According to the San\nquo chi (Chen Shou 1987:192\u201396, my translation),\nThere are slightly more than 50 countries [in Ma\nHan]. Larger guks [polities] consist of approximately\n10,000 households, and smaller guks consist of sev-\neral thousands of households, making up a total of\napproximately 100,000 households.. . . There are 24\nguks in Byun Han and Jin Han [12 each]. Larger guks\nconsist of between 4,000 and 5,000 households and\nsmaller guks consist of between 600 and 700 house-\nholds, making up a total of between 40,000 and\n50,000 households.\nThese population figures are summarized in table 1. The\npopulation density in the Ma Han region (the Baekje\nKingdom) is much higher than that of both the Byun\nHan (Gaya) and Jin Han (the Silla Kingdom), mainly be-\ncause arable land is much more abundant in the Ma Han\nthan in the other two regions. Considering all the his-\ntorical and archaeological data available, Saro seems to\nhave been one of the largest polities in the Jin Han region,\nand if this is correct, it is not unreasonable that it may\nhave had at least 5,000 households.\nJ. K. Kim (1974), on the basis of the size of the semi-\nsubterranean pit houses in the Bronze Age of Korea, es-\ntimated that there were four to five persons per nuclear\nfamily household. His estimate, slightly modified (five\nor six per pit house), has been widely used by Korean\nscholars as an average family size for ancient Korea (Lee\n1982; J. B. Kim 1986:228\u201329). Although both Bronze and\nIron Age people(s) practiced wet-rice agriculture, Iron\nAge people worked more land with more effective agri-\ncultural tools, irrigation, drainage, fertilizer, and flood\ncontrols. Thus it is possible that households averaged\nmore than five persons during the Iron Age Sam Han\nperiod. It appears, however, that the average number of\npersons per household during this period was no more\nthan five. According to the Korean chronicle Samguk\nsagi, compiled by Bu-Sik Kim (1977) in a.d. 1145, Jungto\nYeon, a son of Goguryo Kingdom\u2019s Gen. Gaesomoon\nYeon, surrendered to Silla Kingdom in a.d. 666 with 12\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n876 F current anthropology\nfortifications, 763 households, and 3,543 people. Thus\nthe average household size may be calculated as 4.64\npersons in the middle of the 7th century a.d. in the Go-\nguryo Kingdom, which covered an area from southern\nManchuria to northern Korea (figs. 1 and 2). Average\nhousehold size in the Silla Kingdom may have been\nslightly higher because arable land was more abundant\nthere, but, as will be discussed below, it is doubtful that\nthere was a significant difference between the two king-\ndoms in this regard.\nFurther evidence for household composition is found\nin the Korean chronicle Samguk yusa, compiled by Yeon\nIl in the 13th century a.d. According to this source, there\nwere 100 households with 75,000 people in Gaya (Gum-\ngwan Gaya, one of the largest polities in the Byun Han\narea, location of the present-day city of Gimhae). This\npopulation size is unacceptable because of the implau-\nsible number of persons per household that it implies.\nSome Korean historians interpret the \u201c100\u201d as \u201c10,000,\u201d\nassuming that Yeon Il made a mistake in one Chinese\ncharacter (Lee 1982:18). If we accept Lee\u2019s interpretation,\nan average of 7.5 persons made up a household during\nthe first century a.d. in the Byun Han area. The Byun\nHan area is very well known for its fertile land, and\nconsequently it can be assumed that the population den-\nsity in conjunction with carrying capacity was relatively\nhigh.\nAgain according to the Samguk yusa, there were\n178,936 households in Gumsung, the capital of the Silla\nKingdom during its heyday (ca. a.d. 750). If we accept\nthis number and multiply by 5, the total population be-\ncomes 894,680 people in the capital alone. If we multiply\nby 7.5, the total population becomes more than 1.3 mil-\nlion, which is even more unlikely. Thus this also seems\nto be an error made by the compiler of the document.\nThe area of the capital (ca. 187 km2) is not large enough\nto accommodate that many people (which would yield\na population density of a little more than 4,784 persons\/\nkm2), and therefore it is reasonable to interpret the num-\nber (178,936) as the total population size (Lee 1982:30).\nIf we divide 178,936 by 7.5, the average number of per-\nsons per household, the number of households in the\ncity becomes 23,858. This number does not correspond\nwith the historical record of the San quo chi. If, instead,\nwe divide 178,936 by 5, the total number of households\nis 35,787, which corresponds with the historical docu-\nment and is more reasonable and convincing.\nAll these things considered, the figure of five persons\nper house is adopted as the average in this paper, and,\nfrom the demographic information recorded in the San\nquo chi, the population size for Saro during the 2d cen-\ntury a.d. (midpoint between the 1st and the 3rd century\na.d.) can be estimated as follows: 5,000 (households) #\n5 (persons) p 25,000 people. Next, combining the dem-\nographic figures appearing in the sources it is possible\nto estimate the rate of population growth for the Saro\npolity.\nTo determine the annual rate of population growth (r),\nthe following Malthusian model is commonly used:\nktN p N e ,0\nwhere N is the final population size reached from the\ninitial population N0 after time elapsed (t) (Hassan 1978:\n69; 1981:139). Thus, the annual rate of population growth\n(k) is determined by the following equation:\nktN p N e ,0\nktN\/N p e ,0\nktln (N\/N ) p ln (e ) p kt,0\nk p ln (N\/N )\/t.0\nThe initial population size of the Saro polity is as-\nsumed to have been 25,000 at around a.d. 250 (on the\nbasis of the San quo qui) and to have reached 178,936\nin the heyday of the Silla Kingdom around a.d. 750 (on\nthe basis of the Samguk yusa). Thus, the annual rate of\npopulation growth for the Saro polity for 500 years can\nbe determined as follows: k p ln(178,936\/25,000)\/500 p\n0.003936 p 0.394%. This means that the population in-\ncreased by 3.94 persons per 1,000 per year, which seems\nrelatively high considering that the 17th century was less\nthan 0.6% and that of the European population as a\nwhole about 0.4% (Hassan 1981:234). According to Co-\nwgill (1975:511),\nSurges implying rates of natural increase of from 3\nto about 7 per 1,000 per year over regions up to\nsome tens of thousands of square kilometers, sus-\ntained over two or three centuries (a doubling of\npopulation in about 240 to 100 years), have not been\nuncommon during the past few thousand years, but\nthey are interspersed with periods of very slow\ngrowth or decline. Overall regional trends spanning\na millennium or more show net population gains\nthat are rarely more than what would have resulted\nfrom a steady rate of increase of 1 or 2 per 1,000 per\nyear (population doubling in 350 to 700 years), and\nare perhaps never over 3 per 1,000 per year (doubling\nin about 240 years).\nIt is questionable whether this annual population growth\nrate (0.394%) is enough to cause overpopulation in terms\nof a critical scarcity of productive agricultural land, lead-\ning to conflict over arable land.\nThe following passage from the San quo chi (Chen\nShou 1987:194, my translation, emphasis added) suggests\nthat underpopulation or depopulation, rather than over-\npopulation, was a key factor in the occurrence of warfare\nin southern Korea between the 1st and the 3d century\na.d.:\nAt the end of Hwan Emperor [a.d. 155\u201357] and\nYoung Emperor [a.d. 168\u201370] [of Later Han China],\nHan [of the Sam Han, either Jin Han or Ma Han,\nsource of the confusion] and Ye [Dongye] became\nstrong and prosperous. Gun [Naklang]7Hyun could\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 877\nnot control them so that many people [of the\nGun7Hyun] escaped [migrated] into the Han guk.\nDuring the reign of the Gun An [of Later Han\nChina, a.d. 196\u2013220], Son-gang Gong divided the\nsterile land located south of Doonyu Hyun and\nmade it the territory of Daebang Gun. [He then]\nSent Son-mo Gong and Chang Jang to gather the ref-\nugees [of the Gun7Hyun]. [So they] Conscripted war-\nriors and attacked Han and Ye. People who [escaped\nand] resided in [Jin Han and Dongye] gradually came\nout of [Jin Han and Dongye] and came back to Dae-\nbang Gun. Hereafter, Wa [ancient Japan] and Han\n[Jin Han] at last became subordinated to Daebang.\nJudging from the context, the Naklang and Daebang Han\nChinese commanderies of northwestern Korea may have\nlost a great number of people who had been engaged in\nvarious kinds of productive activities. The reason,\nthough not clearly stated, was probably flight to avoid\nheavy taxation and frequent levies. If the annual popu-\nlation growth rate was in fact higher than the rate com-\nputed above (0.394%), this is evidence that population\nmovement (migration) also played a key role in rapid\npopulation increase.\nThe two Chinese commanderies organized military\nforces and conducted a military campaign to invade Jin\nHan and Dongye. Eventually they defeated them in bat-\ntle and made them their subordinates. More important,\nthey forced the refugees to return to their original ter-\nritories. Here warfare appears to have been motivated by\na desire to obtain captives for labor forces or at least to\nget their people back. In other words, a sizable population\nwas regarded not as a resource stress but as a source of\nwealth, since people must have paid taxes and tribute\nand provided corve\u00b4e labor. Also, it is apparent that both\nthe Naklang and the Daebang commandery were also\ninterested in the acquisition of territory. Population pres-\nsure does not seem to have been a critical factor in this\nconflict.\nIn many other cases during the Three Kingdoms period\nin Korea (1st\u20135th century a.d.) when relatively large pol-\nities like the Baekje Kingdom, Gaya, Wa (ancient Japan),\nand the Silla Kingdom were involved in either offensive\nor defensive warfare, they were interested in capturing\npeople and taking them to their countries. (The historical\naccount \u201cSilla recaptured the Wasan fortification and\nkilled 200 Baekje citizens,\u201d which appears in the Samguk\nsagi [King Suktalhae 20, a.d. 76], is an exception.) The\nfollowing historical account (Yeom Sa Chi) from the San\nquo chi (Chen Shou 1987:193\u201394, my translation) con-\ncerns securing captives for labor forces:\nDuring Wangmang\u2019s [reign, during Sin China, inter-\nmediate dynasty between the Former and Later Han]\nGi Hwang [a.d. 20\u201322], Yeom Sa Chi, who was Woo-\nguhsa [local official] in Jin Han, heard that Naklang\nhad very fertile land and its people were rich. So, [he]\ndesired to escape [from Jin Han] to come to give\nhimself up to [the Naklang]. He departed from his\nvillage, and along the way he saw a man scaring\nsparrows away in the field. [Recognizing that] his\nlanguage was different from that of [Jin] Han, [Yeom\nSa] Chi asked [what happened]. He replied, \u201cWe are\nChinese, my name is Horae. While fifteen hundred\nof us were logging, we were attacked by [Jin] Han.\nWe had our hair cut and became slaves, and three\nyears have passed since then.\u201d [Yeom Sa] Chi said,\n\u201cI am just about to give up myself to Chinese Nak-\nlang. Are you willing to come?\u201d Horae said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n[Yeom Sa] Chi of Jin [Han] took Horae along and ar-\nrived at Hamja Hyun [an unknown place in Nak-\nlang]. [Hamja] Hyun reported this to [Naklang] Gun.\nThe administrator of the Gun [Hamja Hyun] let Chi\nbe a translator and had him board a big ship at\nGeum Jung [port] on the way to Jin Han to take\nback those of Horae\u2019s peers who had surrendered [to\nJin Han]. Although they took 1,000 people back, the\nremaining 500 people [out of 1,500] had already died.\nAt this time, [Yeom Sa] Chi made himself clear to\nJin Han: \u201cYou give us the 500 people back, or the\nNaklang will send several thousands of warriors on\nbig ships and attack you.\u201d [The administrator of] Jin\nHan said, \u201cFive hundred people have already died;\nwe are immediately responsible for the compensa-\ntion.\u201d Thus Jin Han contributed 15,000 people and\nByun Han contributed 15,000 linen rolls. [Yeom Sa]\nChi took them and came back to [Naklang] Gun\nright away. [The Naklang Commandery officials]\nmade a public recognition of [Yeom Sa] Chi and be-\nstowed on him an official cap, fields, and a house\nwhich his descendants handed down for many gener-\nations. When it reached the fourth year of the Yeon\nGwang reign of Emperor An [a.d. 125], his descen-\ndants were exempted from the labor draft because of\nthat [their ancestor\u2019s contribution to Naklang].\nThis chronicle is considered exaggerated and distorted\nin favor of the Naklang Commandery (Im 1959:22\u201323),\nbut it provides a clear picture of relations between Nak-\nlang and indigenous people at the beginning of the 1st\ncentury a.d. (Gardiner 1969:22). It carries a great deal of\ndescription of the sociocultural, political, and economic\naspects of the Jin Han in particular and the Sam Han in\ngeneral. First of all, this incident took place between the\nNaklang Commandery and Jin Han sometime between\na.d. 20 and 22. Although we cannot determine which of\nthe 12 Jin Han polities was involved in the dispute or\npin down its geographic location, we do know that Jin\nHan existed as a collective entity during that time period.\nMore specifically, Saro, as a member of Jin Han, probably\nexisted in this time period as well.\nAccording to this account, Jin Han captured 1,500\nNaklang people and exploited them as labor for three\nyears. If Jin Han had a problem with population pressure\n(i.e., lack of subsistence resources to support the extra\npopulation), it would not have kept the Naklang people\nfor that long unless it expected to obtain something from\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n878 F current anthropology\ntable 2\nEnvironmental Stresses and Warfare Recorded in the Annals of the Silla Kingdom in the Samguk sagi\nTime Drought\nFlood\/\nRain Typhoon Snow Locusts\nHigh\nTemperature Hail Frost\nEpidemic\nDisease\nCrop\nFailure\nTotal\nStresses Warfare\n1st century b.c. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n1st century a.d. 4 2 3 0 2 2 0 0 1 0 14 17\n2d century a.d. 6 6 2 3 3 2 4 4 3 2 35 24\n3d century a.d. 9 3 2 1 3 1 3 2 1 2 27 24\n4th century a.d. 6 2 0 0 4 1 1 1 1 3 19 4\n5th century a.d. 6 8 1 0 3 1 4 4 2 3 32 30\n6th century a.d. 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 5 10\n7th century a.d.a 3 3 1 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 14 85\n8th century a.d.b 10 3 3 4 5 4 6 2 3 7 47 2\nTotal 46 28 12 11 20 12 19 16 11 18 193 198\naOutlier, eliminated from analysis.\nbAfter unification of Three Kingdoms, eliminated from analysis.\nthem. Eventually the Naklang Commandery not only\ntook 1,000 people back (after 500 people had already died)\nbut also took as many as 15,000 people from Jin Han as\ncompensation for its 500 dead. This was the outcome of\nnegotiation between the two polities to prevent war.\nThus, if warfare had occurred between the two polities,\nthe key factor was not population growth and resource\nstress but instead the desire to secure labor and\/or wealth\n(contra Carneiro 1988; Cowgill 1975:517; 1979:59\u201360;\nsee Dumond 1972:309).\nWe can assume that the captives were forced to be-\ncome slaves or at least subordinates who engaged in basic\nmaterial productive activities (depending on specific in-\ndividual skills) in a hostile country. Thus, as is argued\nby many scholars, population pressure within circum-\nscribed environments is not necessarily correlated with\nwarfare. For example, Dumond (1965) suggests that pop-\nulation growth may have played a positive ecological\nrole. In other words, population growth can serve as a\nspur to improvement of subsistence and commerce\n(Cowgill 1975:517), and these, by raising total income,\nencourage the growth of further population. Whereas cul-\ntural materialists have attempted to relate population\ngrowth to the occurrence of warfare from the perspective\nof an adaptive strategy (e.g., Harris 1971; Larson 1972;\nVayda 1971, 1974), this turns out not to have been the\ncase in ancient Korea. The oversimplified viewpoint\nneeds to be reconsidered at least in this case (see Hallpike\n1973 for a detailed argument).\nIn summary, population during the Korean protohis-\ntoric period was regarded as a source of labor rather than\nthe burden which many anthropologists and archaeolo-\ngists have proposed. The correlation between population\npressure and occurrence of warfare is weak. On some\noccasions the reverse is true, that is, warfare may have\noccurred because of the lack of appropriate population\n(e.g., unbalanced sex and age ratios) (Cowgill 1979:59\u201360;\nOberg 1955:473\u201374; Vayda 1974:184).\nenvironmental stress and warfare\nAn alternative explanation for warfare may be environ-\nmental stress: sudden and unpredicted climatic change\nover a short period, including drought, heavy rain, ty-\nphoon, frost, unusual temperature fluctuation, volcanic\neruption, earthquake, and snow. Along with these vari-\nables, geomorphological transformations such as soil ex-\nhaustion or salinization and overpopulation beyond the\ncarrying capacity of the area have also been considered\nas contributing to environmental stress (Haas 1990:177).\nEnvironmental stress has been considered important for\nthe explanation of sociocultural change by many ar-\nchaeologists (e.g., Braun and Plog 1982, Haas 1990, Jones\net al. 1999). It has not been documented archaeologically\nfor southern Korea in the time period in question, but\nthe Samguk sagi mentions various environmental phe-\nnomena that would have affected crop success or failure\n(leading to abundance or scarcity of food resources) in a\ngiven year or contributed to chronic environmental de-\nterioration that might have caused conflict over insuf-\nficient subsistence resources. By analyzing some of these\nreferences it is possible to examine whether they are\ncorrelated with the occurrence of warfare.\nThe frequencies of various environmental stresses and\nof warfare recorded in the Samguk sagi are represented\nin table 2. (Comets, novas, lightning and thunder, rain-\nbows, and earthquakes are not included.) Crop failure\nand epidemic disease are not environmental stresses in\nthemselves, but their close association with environ-\nmental deterioration (e.g., Jones et al. 1999:138) makes\nit not unreasonable to include them in the table. These\nenvironmental calamities would not have been recorded\nin the historical accounts unless they had had some sig-\nnificant effect (i.e., food stress). Therefore the summa-\ntion of these various calamities is a valid indicator of\nenvironmental stress on the human population in the\nstudy area.\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nVolume 41, Number 5, December 2000 F 879\nFig. 3. Temporal variations of frequencies of environmental stresses (filled squares) and warfare (open squares)\nas recorded in the Samguk sagi.\nFig. 4. Scattergram of the frequency of environmental stress on occurrences of warfare.\nAs can be seen in figure 3, the frequencies of environ-\nmental stress and warfare do not directly correspond\nwith each other, but overall the trends are similar: as\nenvironmental stress increases, the frequency of warfare\nincreases, and vice versa. A significant anomaly occurred\nduring the 7th century, when there were far more in-\nstances of warfare than of environmental stress because\nof the war for the unification of the Jin Han instigated\nby the Silla Kingdom. During this time period, socio-\npolitical phenomena must have played a more important\nrole than environmental conditions, but it is notable that\nthere was a slight increase in environmental stress as\nwell.\nFurther statistical analysis provides a more detailed\nunderstanding of the relationship between environmen-\ntal stress and the occurrence of warfare. The scattergram\nof figure 4 shows a positive linear relationship between\nthe two variables. This implies that as the frequency of\nenvironmental stress increases, the frequency of warfare\nmay also be expected to increase. Therefore, a correlation\nanalysis employing Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient is\nappropriately applied to these data.\nAppropriate use of correlation analysis requires that\nthe data used meet certain criteria. First, variables must\nbe measured on an interval or ratio scale (Kachigan 1986:\n206), a requirement which is met with these raw count\nThis content downloaded from 158.143.197.122 on Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:21:49 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n880 F current anthropology\ntable 3\nAnalysis of Variance for Significance of Regression of\nthe Frequency of Warfare on Time\nSource of\nVariation\nDegrees of\nFreedom\nSum of\nSquares\nMean\nSquares F-Test Significance\nRegression 1 482.563 482.563 11.053 0.05\nResidual 5 218.295 43.659 0.0209\nTotal 6 700.857\ndata. Secondly, the use of Pearson\u2019s r assumes that re-\nlationships between variables are best described by a lin-\near model (Davis 1986:40; Kachigan 1986:205\u20136; Speth\nand Johnson 1976:36). All variable pairs except those for\nthe 4th century show a linear trend and thus satisfy the\ncriterion. Visual inspection of crossplots is the best way\nto detect linear relationships between variables (Carroll\n1961:360), and it can be seen from the plot that a straight\nline would adequately describe the trend in the data.\nTo examine the nature of the relationship between the\ntwo variables, a linear regression analysis was performed.\nFirst of all, the outliers observed in the 7th and 8th cen-\nturies were eliminated. Since references to warfare re-\ncorded during the time period were related not to state\nformation but to the unification of the Three Kingdoms,\nthey should be excluded from consideration. In contrast,\nwhereas there is no environmental stress in the 1st cen-\ntury b.c. this does not significantly affect the linear re-\nlationship, and therefore it is unnecessary to eliminate\nthe zero from the data set.\nThe least-squares equation for these data is y p 3.24\n1 0.647x, which is plotted in figure 4. The predicted\nvalue of y (the frequency of warfare occurrence) for any\nvalue of x (environmental stress) is given by a point on\nthe line and can be calculated according to the equation.\nThe significance of the slope b was also tested using the\nsample regression equation. The basic assumption is that\nif there is no relationship between the two variables of\nenvironmental stress and warfare, then the slope of the\nregression equation will be expected to be close to zero.\nA statistical test for slope a, a t statistic (t p estimate\/\nstandard error), was used. The null hypothesis should be\nrejected if t is greater than a given value of a p 0.05\nsignificance level using a one-tailed test with degrees of\nfreedom p n22. Since t p 3.31 is greater than 2.015, we\ncan reject the null hypothesis (0.01 ! p-value ! 0.025)\n(see table 3).\nAccording to this statistical analysis, the data from the\nSamguk sagi suggest that the occurrence of warfare is\npositively correlated with environmental stress. To mea-\nsure the strength of the positive linear relationship, the\ncorrelation coefficient was computed. Given seven pairs\nof observations, the computed correlation coefficient r\nwas 0.8297.\nsummary\nThis analysis of historical documents has led to the con-\nclusion that while warfare played a significant role in\nsociopolitical development in ancient Korea, the causes\nof that warfare differ from those proposed by Carneiro\n(1970, 1988). According to the conventional model, pop-\nulation pressure within a circumscribed environment\nhas been considered a source of all kinds of conflict in\nhuman social evolution. However, the case of ancient\nKorea does not support this model. Instead, warfare ap-\nparently occurred as a result of underpopulation; popu-\nlations were considered not just food\/goods consumers\nbut food producers and sources of wealth for elites (e.g.,\nthe objects of taxation and corve\u00b4es). Furthermore, sta-\ntistical analysis confirms a strong positive correlation\nbetween the shortage of subsistence resources caused by\nenvironmental stress and the occurrence of violent con-\nflict. Thus, rather than assuming that Carneiro\u2019s warfare\ntheory applies everywhere, it is important to consider\nthe unique cultural, historical, and environmental con-\ntext of the specific study area under examination. War-\nfare theory may provide a plausible explanation for the\nemergence of the state-level societies in the prehistory\nof Korea, but the causes of the warfare may not be the\nsame as Carneiro proposed.\nReferences Cited\nb r a u n , d a v i d p . , a n d s t e p h e n p l o g . 1982.
