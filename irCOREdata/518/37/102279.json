However, the \nmain cause of their thermal sensitivity is a strong non-radiative recombination.  \n \n \nIn spite of the fact that InAs quantum dot (QD) \nlasers have low threshold current densities, Jth \n[1], the thermal sensitivity of the devices \ncontinues to be a significant problem. This \nlimits the commercial use of these lasers. \nDifferent mechanisms of re-emission of \ncarriers into the optical confinement layers \nactivated by increasing temperature and their \nsubsequent radiative or nonradiative \nrecombination in the OCL as well as effect of \ngain saturation, which causes an increase of \nthe threshold current with temperature have \nbeen discussed in the literature as possible \ncauses of this behaviour [2, 3]. A significant \nimprovement in the thermal stability of Jth has \nbeen achieved using p-type doping of the QD \nactive region to avoid gain saturation [4] albeit \nat the expense of a higher Jth. In our previous \nwork it was shown that the thermal sensitivity \nof Jth in quantum dots is caused mainly by \nnonradiative recombination processes, which \ndepend on the band gap of the dots and their \nenergy level distribution. The results showed \nthe likely importance that Auger \nrecombination can have in 1.3 \u00b5m QD lasers \n[2, 3]. In this paper using a set of 1.3 \u00b5m InAs \nQD lasers with different cavity lengths and \ndifferent QD densities we investigated the \neffects of gain saturation and non-radiative \nrecombination on the thermal sensitivity of Jth.  \nThe lasers studied were 5, 10, 15, and 20 \u00b5m \nwide ridge dot-in-a-well structures with five \nstacked layers of InAs QDs within \nGa0.85In0.15As quantum wells separated by \n50 nm GaAs barriers. The active region was \nembedded between 2 \u00b5m Al0.4Ga0.60As \ncladding layers in a 200 nm GaAs waveguide. \nThe facets were as-cleaved and the cavity \nlengths were 2, 3, and 5 mm. The lasing line \ncorresponded to the ground state emission at \nall temperatures with a wavelength of \n\u03bb=1.31 \u00b5m at room temperature (lasing from \nthe excited state was observed in some of the \nshorter cavity devices above 320-340 K). \nLasers with longer cavity lengths showed the \nlowest threshold current densities of 30-\n50 A\/cm2 at T=295 K, which is close to the \nrecord low values for 1.3 \u00b5m QD lasers [1, 2]. \nUsing the measured integrated spontaneous \nemission rate at Jth, which is proportional to \nthe radiative recombination rate, we studied \nthe temperature variation of the radiative part \nof total threshold current density, Jrad. These \ndirect measurements allow us to estimate the \nrelative contributions of radiative and non-\nradiative processes to Jth at different \ntemperatures. \nFig. 1 shows the temperature dependence of \nthe pulsed threshold current density, Jth, and its \nradiative component, Jrad, measured for the \ndevices with different cavity lengths of 2 mm \nand 5 mm. The decrease in Jth with increasing \ntemperature below 180 K is often observed in \nQD lasers and is attributed to the enhanced \ncarrier transport between dots with increasing \ntemperature, which allows carriers to \ncontribute more effectively to the lasing \nprocess [3]. Above 200 K, Jth increases \nstrongly whilst Jrad remains almost temperature \ninsensitive in the 5 mm-device as originally \npredicted by Arakawa et al. [5], demonstrating \nthat the strong increase of Jth is caused by non-\nradiative processes. An increase of Jrad in the \nshorter cavity device and the higher thermal \nsensitivity of Jth in this device can be \nexplained by the fact that QD lasers are much \n4020-7803-9217-5\/05\/$20.00\u00a92005 IEEE\nTuAA5\n16:45 - 17:00\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Due to the \nshorter cavity length of the 2 mm device, the \nmirror loss is more than double that of the \n5 mm device. Therefore in order to \ncompensate for the gain reduction due to \nincreasing homogeneous broadening at higher \ntemperatures a higher carrier concentration is \nrequired to achieve threshold, especially in the \nlasers with increased mirror losses. This effect \nwith increasing temperature can lead to an \nincrease of Jrad (and Jth) and sometimes to a \ntransition from lasing from the ground state to \nlasing from an excited state, which was \nobserved in the 2 mm-devices above 340 K. \nThe characteristic temperatures (T0) \ncorresponding to both Jth and Jrad for the \ndevices with different cavity lengths over the \ntemperature intervals T=280-330 K and \nT=330-360 K are summarized in Table 1. An \ninteresting fact is that the T0-values for both Jth \nand Jrad decrease with decreasing cavity length \ndemonstrating the increased importance of \ngain saturation in the shorter devices. The \nincreased T0 of the 2 mm device above \nT=330 K is caused by a switch of the lasing \nemission to the first excited state. However, as \none can see from the Table 1 and Figure 1 the \nT0 of Jth is also much smaller than that of Jrad \nshowing that the origin of the thermal \nsensitivity of Jth is non-radiative \nrecombination. Assuming that below 200 K \nnonradiative recombination is negligible (this \nis supported by the fact that Jrad closely follows \nJth in this temperature range), we estimated the \nmaximum fraction of Jrad at room temperature. \nWe find that Jrad is at most 37%, 27%, and \n22% in the 5 mm, 3 mm, and 2 mm devices, \nrespectively. Room temperature high \nhydrostatic pressure studies of Jth and Jrad of \nthese devices further suggests that Auger \nrecombination is the dominant non-radiative \nrecombination process around room \ntemperature. \n \nTable 1.
