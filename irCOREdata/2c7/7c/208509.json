This paper provides a critical, but constructive, discussion of the \nvarious methods used for the valuation of non-renewable resource depletion \nand long-term environmental damage and for the weighting of consumption \nexpenditures for income inequalities. Several recommendations are given on \nhow to improve the methodology for future updates of existing studies or for \nthe construction of new measures. Sensitivity analysis shows that if these rec-\nommendations are followed for the valuation of resource depletion and long-\nterm environmental damage, then the so-called \u2018threshold\u2019 hypothesis, which \nseemed to have gained empirical support from all studies undertaken so far, \nfails to materialise. This suggests that, as far as factors related to the environ-\nment are concerned, the widening gap between ISEW and GPI on the one hand \nand gross national product (GNP) on the other, might be an artefact of highly \ncontestable methodological assumptions. \n \nKeywords: index, welfare, sustainability, resources, environmental damage, ine-\nquality \n3 \n1. Introduction \nFollowing the pioneering work by Daly and Cobb (1989) and Cobb and Cobb \n(1994) for the US, the construction of an Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare \n(ISEW) has become quite popular with studies undertaken for an increasing \nnumber of countries. An ISEW has, for example, been constructed for Austria \n(Stockhammer et al., 1997), Chile (Casta\u00f1eda, 1999), Germany (Diefenbacher, \n1994), Italy (Guenno and Tiezzi, 1998), the Netherlands (Rosenberg, Oegema \nand Bovy, 1995), Scotland (Moffatt and Wilson, 1994), Sweden (Jackson and \nStymne, 1996) and the UK (Jackson et al., 1997). Sometimes these studies come, \nwith only slightly changed methodology, under the name of Genuine Progress \nIndicator (GPI), as, for example, in Australia (Hamilton, 1999) and the US (Re-\ndefining Progress, 1999). For Australia there also exists a related measure, \nwhich comes under the name of sustainable net benefit index (SNBI) (Lawn and \nSanders, 1999). \nComputation of an ISEW\/GPI usually starts from personal consumption ex-\npenditures. These expenditures are weighted with an index of income inequal-\nity. Then, certain welfare-relevant contributions are added such as the services \nof household labour and the services of streets and highways, whereas certain \nwelfare-relevant losses are subtracted such as so-called \u2018defensive expendi-\ntures\u2019, costs of environmental pollution, costs of depletion of non-renewable \nresources and long-term environmental damage costs. The resulting index is \nregarded as a more accurate indicator of sustainable economic welfare than a \ncountry\u2019s gross national product (GNP), which, according to proponents of \n4 \nISEW\/GPI, even if not originally invented for such a purpose, is used by policy \nmakers and in everyday language as a yardstick for economic welfare.1 \nThe methodology used for ISEW\/GPI studies has been criticised by some au-\nthors, including the present one (see Nordhaus, 1992; the contributions in Cobb \nand Cobb, 1994, pp. 95-201; Atkinson, 1995; Neumayer, 1999a, 1999b). However, \nwhereas Neumayer (1999b), for example, provides a general conceptual cri-\ntique, this paper\u2019s objective is more confined and more concrete. It aspires to \nput forward some constructive suggestions on the methodology used for ISEW, \nGPI and related measures and to shed some doubt on the so-called \u2018threshold \nhypothesis\u2019. More specifically, it focuses on three items: the valuation of the \ndepletion of non-renewable resources (section 2), the valuation of long-term \nenvironmental damage (section 3) and the adjustment of consumption expendi-\ntures for income inequality (section 4). These items exert a significant influence \non most ISEW\/GPI and related measures. \nIn evaluating the results of their work, proponents of ISEW\/GPI have put \ngreat emphasis on a clearly discernible trend of the ISEW\/GPI in almost all \nstudies undertaken so far: starting from around the 1970s or early 1980s, de-\npending on the country, the ISEW\/GPI no longer rises very much or even falls, \nwhereas GNP continues to rise. As an explanation for this widening gap be-\n                                                 \n1 Some studies refer to gross domestic product (GDP) instead of GNP. The difference between \nGNP and GDP is that GDP includes output produced by foreigners within the national \nboundaries and excludes output produced by nationals abroad. As the difference between \nGNP and GDP does not matter here, the following paragraphs usually only refer to GNP, \nexcept when a study explicitly refers to GDP. \n5 \ntween ISEW\/GPI and GNP, Max-Neef (1995, p. 117) has put forward the so-\ncalled \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019: \u2018for every society there seems to be a period in \nwhich economic growth (as conventionally measured) brings about an im-\nprovement in the quality of life, but only up to a point \u2014 the threshold point \u2014 \nbeyond which, if there is more economic growth, quality of life may begin to \ndeteriorate\u2019. This \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019 is referred to in almost every recent \nISEW\/GPI study and Max-Neef (1995, p. 117) himself regarded the evidence \nfrom these studies \u2018a fine illustration of the Threshold Hypothesis\u2019. Anielski \n(1999, p. 3) suggests that the hypothesis confirms something \u2018what many \nAmericans and Canadians feel and are experiencing \u2014 the economy and stock \nexchanges may be soaring but average citizens sense the steady erosion of their \neconomic quality of life\u2019. \nThis paper argues that proponents of ISEW\/GPI consider their results too \neasily as evidence for the \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019. It suggests that, as far as de-\npletion of non-renewable resources and long-term environmental damage con-\ntribute to the widening gap between ISEW\/GPI and GNP, this gap might be the \nartefact of highly contestable methodological assumptions. Sensitivity analysis \nis employed to demonstrate that these items no longer give rise to a threshold if \nthe assumption of a cost escalation factor in the valuation of non-renewable re-\nsource depletion and the assumption of cumulative long-term environmental \ndamage is abandoned. \n \n \n6 \n2. Depletion of non-renewable resources \nAs concerns the depletion of natural resources, the method used by various \nstudies differs on three major aspects: first, either replacement costs or resource \nrents are used to compute the deduction item; second, either national consump-\ntion or national production is the reference for valuation; and, third, if the re-\nsource rent method is used, then either total resource rents are deducted or the \nso-called El Serafy method is used for calculating resource user costs, which are \nthen deducted. \n \n2.1 Replacement costs or resource rents? \nLet us start with the first and most fundamental difference. The ambiguity be-\ntween either using the resource rent method or the replacement cost method \nstems back to the original US ISEW. Whereas Daly and Cobb (1989) and Cobb \nand Cobb (1994) in their original ISEW computations deducted the total value \nof mine production, the revised ISEW in Cobb and Cobb (1994) switched to the \nreplacement cost method: for non-renewable energy production each barrel of \noil equivalent was valued at a replacement cost which was assumed to escalate \nby 3% per annum between 1950 and 1990 and was anchored around an as-\nsumed cost of 75$ in 1988. The Austrian, German and Italian ISEW followed \nDaly and Cobb (1989) in deducting the total value of mine production. The Aus-\ntralian SNBI study also applied the resource rent method, but computed user \ncosts according to the El Serafy method. The Chilean, Dutch, Scottish, Swedish \nand UK ISEW and the Australian and US GPI, on the other hand, followed the \n7 \nreplacement cost method of the revised ISEW in Cobb and Cobb (1994) together \nwith the 3% escalation factor. \nThere is a clear rationale for using the resource rent method: Because non-\nrenewable resources are irreversibly lost in the process of use, non-renewable \nresource extraction represents the (partial) liquidation of an existing capital \nstock. Rental income that accrues from resource extraction is therefore non-\nsustainable into the future and should either fully (total resource rents) or \npartly (user costs according to El Serafy method) be deducted. The resource rent \nmethod is inspired by the idea of sustainable income and aims to separate the \nsustainable from the non-sustainable income parts. The rationale for using the \nreplacement cost method, on the other hand, is completely different. It stems \nfrom the idea that non-renewable resource use, which cannot be prolonged for-\never and is therefore not sustainable into the indefinite future, would have to be \nreplaced by renewable resources. \nThe replacement cost method suffers from two major problems, however: \nfirst, the underlying assumption is that non-renewable resource use has to be \nfully replaced by renewable resources in the present; second, the escalation fac-\ntor assumes that replacement costs increase over time. As concerns the first \nproblem, there is no convincing rationale for why non-renewable resources \nwould have to be fully replaced by renewable resources in the present, when \nthere are still available reserves that would last for many decades. For example, \nthe static reserves to production ratio, which gives the time of how long proven \nreserves would last at current production levels, was 41 years for oil, 63 years \nfor natural gas and 218 years for coal at the end of 1998 (British Petroleum, \n8 \n1999).2 If non-renewable resources are cheaper than renewable resources, as \nCobb and Cobb (1994) assume and is certainly correct for energy resources, then \na rational resource extractor would be foolish not to use up the remaining non-\nrenewable resources first, before switching to renewable resources later on. For \nthe same reason, it seems odd to deduct replacement costs for the totality of \nresource use in the present year. The relatively high replacement cost of 75 US$ \nin 1988, which has been taken over by other studies as well, only makes sense if \ntotal current non-renewable resource use would need to be replaced with re-\nnewable resources in the present. Again, this bears the question why a rational \nresource extractor should switch to extremely expensive renewable replacement \nresources, when much cheaper non-renewable resources are still available. Why \nnot wait with switching until some point in the future, when switching becomes \nnecessary and is likely to be much cheaper as the technology for the extraction \nand use of renewable resources will have improved? \nRelated to this last point is the second problem, the 3% escalation factor, \nwhich has also rather uncritically been taken over by other studies. As a ration-\nale for this assumption of constantly increasing replacement costs, Cobb and \n                                                 \n2 On the one hand, the static reserves to production ratio overestimates available resource \nreserves as production is likely to increase in the future. On the other hand, it underesti-\nmates available resource reserves as new reserves become available. For example, while oil \nproduction has increased from 58 million barrels per day in 1973 to about 72 million barrels \nper day in 1998, proven oil reserves have not only failed to decrease, but have even in-\ncreased from 630 thousand million barrels to 1050 thousand million barrels (British Petro-\nleum, 1999, pp. 4 and 8). \n9 \nCobb (1994, p. 267) refer to the costs per foot of oil drilling which they report to \nhave increased by about 6% per annum during the period of high oil prices in \nthe 1970s, which triggered the exploration and drilling of more difficult to ex-\nploit oil fields. They reason that \u2018when the limits of a resource are being \nreached, the cost of extracting the next unit is more costly than the previous \nunit\u2019 and that \u2018this principle presumably applies also to renewable fuels, though \nnot as dramatically as to oil and gas\u2019, which is why the escalation factor is as-\nsumed to be 3% instead of 6%. Especially with respect to renewable energy re-\nsources, such reasoning might be erroneous, however. The most likely candi-\ndate for replacing non-renewable fuels is renewable solar energy. But the solar \nenergy influx exceeds current world energy demand by at least one order of \nmagnitude (Norgaard, 1986, p. 326), so that the limits of this resource are \nunlikely to be reached. Also, costs for solar energy use are currently high be-\ncause the technology is still in the early stages of development, but costs will \nfall over time as technology improves (Lenssen and Flavin, 1996). Instead of \nassuming replacement costs to escalate by 3% per year, it might therefore be \nmore appropriate to assume that replacement costs are falling over time. \nThe replacement cost method with the 3% escalation factor contributes to the \n\u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019. The method computes the deduction term as \n \n)1988(03.1$75)()( \u2212\u22c5\u22c5= ttRtRC  \n \n10 \nwhere R is resource use and t is the year of computation. This deduction term \nwill rise over time if R does not fall by more than 3% per annum. What is more, \nthe deduction term will rise at a rate faster than GNP if the growth rate of GNP \nis smaller than 3% plus the growth rate of resource use: \n \nR\nR\nGNP\nGNPif\nGNP\nGNP\nRC\nRC\n\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\n+<> 03.0 , \n \nwhere a dot above a variable represents its partial derivative with respect to \ntime. If resource use does not fall significantly and GNP grows at a rate of less \nthan 3%, which is not uncommon, then the replacement method together with \nthe 3% escalation factor, ceteris paribus, causes an increasing gap between GNP \nand the ISEW\/GPI, thus contributing to the \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019. Exactly this \nhas happened in the existing studies, as figure 1 shows, which presents the in-\ndexed trend of GNP\/GDP together with the indexed trend for resource deple-\ntion with the 3% escalation factor for a selection of four country studies: the \nDutch, Swedish, US and UK ISEW.3 As can be seen, the indexed trend for re-\nsource depletion with the 3% escalation factor is growing at a faster rate than \nthe indexed trend of GNP\/GDP, thus causing a widening gap over time. Ce-\nteris paribus, this widening gap will translate into a widening gap between a \ncountry\u2019s ISEW and its GNP\/GDP and create evidence for the \u2018threshold hy-\npothesis\u2019. The replacement cost method together with the 3% escalation factor \n                                                 \n3 Because the threshold hypothesis refers to a period during the 1970s or early 1980s, for ease \nof exposition 1970 is the start year in the figure. \n11 \nhas a substantial influence on the ISEW or GPI. The item depletion of natural \nresources represents, for example, approximately 37% of all deduction items in \nthe US ISEW in 1990, 31% in the UK ISEW in 1996, 21% in the Swedish ISEW in \n1992 and 36% in the Dutch ISEW in 1992. \nIf instead replacement costs are not assumed to escalate by 3% per annum, \nbut, for the sake of argument, are assumed to remain constant, then the item \n\u2018depletion of non-renewable resources\u2019 does no longer give rise to a \u2018threshold \nhypothesis\u2019. See figure 1 again, which also shows the indexed trend for resource \ndepletion without the escalation factor. In the US and the UK indexed \nGNP\/GDP is now rising faster than resource depletion due to decreasing non-\nrenewable resource intensity of GNP\/GDP, thus creating the opposite of a \nthreshold effect.4 In the Swedish and Dutch case, both trends have a similar \nshape over time, so that resource depletion does not contribute to a widening \ngap between ISEW and GDP. \n \n2.2 Resource production or resource consumption? \nIn the last section, it has not been made clear whether resource use refers to the \nproduction or consumption of resources.5 The reason is that some studies differ \n                                                 \n4  The same holds true for the US GPI, which is not shown here for reasons of space limita-\ntions. \n5 Both reviewers have noted that they do not like the term resource \u2018production\u2019 and would \nprefer the term resource \u2018extraction\u2019 instead. While I sympathise with this view as resources \nare not produced in the strict sense, I stick to the term resource \u2018production\u2019 as this is the \n12 \non this respect. On the one hand, all studies using the resource rent method \nvalue the production of resources. This is correct as the resource rent method \nattempts to determine the sustainable parts of an income stream derived from \nresource production. Only rents from resource production, not from consump-\ntion, enter the national income accounts. Therefore, to deduct the value of con-\nsumption instead would mean to deduct something which has never been \nadded in the first place. \nOn the other hand, the studies using the replacement cost method are not \nconsistent in their reference point. Whereas the revised US ISEW in Cobb and \nCobb (1994) and the US GPI estimate the cost for replacing national production, \nthe Australian GPI and the Chilean, Dutch, Scottish, Swedish and UK ISEW es-\ntimate the cost for replacing national consumption of non-renewable resources. \nMethodologically correct is the valuation of consumption, not production. This \nis because the rationale behind the method is to replace non-renewable resource \nuse. Where these resources come from, whether they are imported or domesti-\ncally produced, simply does not matter. The idea behind the replacement cost \nmethod is not to cancel out non-sustainable income streams, as it is with the \nresource rent method. Instead, the idea is to estimate the costs of replacing all \nnon-renewable resources in use for production. \n \n                                                                                                                                               \nlanguage used in the relevant literature, including the two ISEW-studies in Daly and Cobb \n(1989) and Diefenbacher (1994). \n13 \n2.3 Total resource rents or user costs according to the El Serafy method? \nFinally, those studies, which use the resource rent method, are not unanimous \non whether to deduct total resource rents or merely the user costs computed \naccording to the El Serafy method. Total resource rents are deducted in the \noriginal US, Austrian, German and Italian ISEW, whereas the Australian SNBI \nstudy uses the El Serafy method. The difference matters as user costs are in \ngeneral only a fraction of total resource rents (see the appendix to this paper). \nIn my view, the El Serafy method is to be preferred. This is because given \nsubstitutability between natural capital in the form of non-renewable resources \nand other forms of capital, such as manufactured or human capital, the finite \nincome stream from a non-renewable resource stock can be transformed into a \nlower infinite stream of income from other forms of capital (Hartwick 1996). \nWhat the El Serafy method does, is to compute the difference between these \ntwo income streams and to deduct the resulting so-called user costs of non-\nrenewable resource extraction. Deducting total resource rents instead implies \nthat one cannot sustain an infinite stream of income from a finite non-renewable \nresource via investing the resource rents into other forms of capital (see also \nNeumayer, 2000). \n \n \n3. Long-term environmental damage \nAs concerns the valuation of long-term environmental damage, or the costs of \nclimate change as this item is sometimes called, the fundamental question is \nwhether this value should accumulate over time or not. All but the Australian \n14 \nGPI study have opted for accumulation. It is the objective of this section to \nshow that accumulation is incorrect. \nMost studies follow the approach taken by Daly and Cobb (1989) and Cobb \nand Cobb (1994) in valuing each barrel of oil equivalent of annual nonrenew-\nable energy resource consumption at 0.50$ in 1972 dollars. This value is de-\nducted from the ISEW in this year, but also in all following years. Similarly, in \nany given year not only the value for current resource consumption is de-\nducted, but the values from all past years as well. Cobb and Cobb (1994, p. 74) \nprovide as justification for this accumulation approach that they \u2018imagined that \na tax or rent of $0.50 per barrel-equivalent had been levied on all non-renewable \nenergy consumed during that period and set aside to accumulate in a non-\ninterest-bearing account (...). That account might be thought of as a fund avail-\nable to compensate future generations for the long-term damage caused by the \nuse of fossil fuels and atomic energy.\u2019 \nJackson et al. (1997, p. 23) realise in their computation of the UK ISEW, that \n\u2018the major problem with this approach (...) is the arbitrary way in which a \ncharge is calculated\u2019. Instead they purport to value each tonne of greenhouse \ngas emissions with its marginal social cost, which they correctly define as re-\nflecting \u2018the total (discounted) value of all the future damage arising from that \ntonne of emissions\u2019. Strangely, however, they follow Cobb and Cobb\u2019s (1994) \nlead in letting this damage accumulate over time. Stockhammer et al. (1997) \nsimilarly compute marginal social damage costs for the Austrian ISEW \u2014 and \nlet the estimated damage accumulate over time. \n15 \nAccumulation is theoretically incorrect (Atkinson, 1995; Neumayer, 1999a). \nThis is easiest to see with the UK ISEW study. In valuing each tonne of emis-\nsions with its marginal social cost, the total future damage of this tonne of emis-\nsions is already valued. To let this value accumulate over time is self-\ncontradictory and therefore simply wrong as it leads to multiple counting of the \ntotal future damage. Jackson et al. (1997) value each tonne of carbon with a \nmarginal social cost of \u00a311.4 in 1990 prices. With accumulation, the present \nvalue damage caused by one tonne of carbon is simply infinite without dis-\ncounting or \u00a311.4\/r with discounting, where r is the discount rate. With a dis-\ncount rate of, say, 5% per annum, the present value damage per tonne of carbon \nis \u00a3228. This present value damage per tonne of carbon of \u00a3228 is nothing else \nbut the marginal social cost per tonne of carbon, which contradicts Jackson et \nal.\u2019s (1997) earlier assumption of marginal social cost of \u00a311.4. \nThat accumulation is incorrect is not as straightforward to show with Cobb \nand Cobb\u2019s (1994) approach, as they do not base their valuation on marginal \nsocial costs. Instead, as mentioned, they justify valuing long-term environ-\nmental damage from fossil fuel consumption by $0.50 per barrel of oil equiva-\nlent with the idea that this would represent the money to be set aside in order \nto compensate future generations for long-term environmental damage. As be-\nfore, however, accumulation leads to multiple counting here as well. This is be-\ncause with accumulation money for the damage caused by each unit of emis-\nsions is set aside not only in the year of emission, but for each subsequent year \nas well. Again, the present value of damage caused, but this time per barrel of \noil equivalent, is equal to $0.50\/r, which equals $10 at a discount rate of 5% per \n16 \nannum. With a carbon content of 0.13 tones ber barrel of oil (Poterba 1991, p. \n75), this translates into a present value damage per tonne of carbon of about \n$75, which is much smaller than the \u00a3228 of the UK ISEW. \nNote that I do not claim here that a marginal social cost per tonne of carbon \nof 75$ (US ISEW) or \u00a3228 (UK ISEW) would be unjustifiable. It is true that 75$ is \nclose to the upper end of damage cost estimates as reported in IPCC (1996, pp. \n179-224) and \u00a3228 is way beyond the most pessimistic upper estimation end. \nBut, given uncertainty and ignorance about the exact consequences of global \nwarming, such high estimates are not absurd per se. However, if proponents of \nISEW think that the marginal social cost per tonne of carbon emitted is so high, \nthen they should make their assumption explicit and they should not use meth-\nodologically incorrect accumulation. \nThe accumulation of long-term environmental damage costs exerts a substan-\ntial influence on the ISEW or GPI. This item represents, for example, approxi-\nmately 33% of all deduction items in the US ISEW in 1990, 23% in the UK ISEW \nin 1996, 30% in the Swedish ISEW in 1992 and 12% in the Dutch ISEW in 1992. \nAccumulation of long-term environmental damage costs also contributes to the \n\u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019. Figure 2 presents the indexed trend of GNP\/GDP to-\ngether with the indexed trend of accumulated long-term environmental dam-\nage and non-accumulated long-term environmental damage. As can be seen, \nthe indexed trend for accumulated long-term environmental damage is grow-\ning much faster than the indexed trend of GNP\/GDP, thus causing a widening \ngap over time. As with the item resource depletion when replacement costs are \nassumed to escalate at 3% per annum, this widening gap will ceteris paribus \n17 \ntranslate into a widening gap between a country\u2019s ISEW and its GNP\/GDP, \nthus contributing to the \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019. \nIf instead long-term environmental damage is not accumulated, then it does \nno longer give rise to a \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019. See figure 2 again. In the US and \nthe UK indexed GNP\/GDP is now rising faster than long-term environmmental \ndamage due to decreasing emission intensity of GNP\/GDP, thus creating the \nopposite of a threshold effect.6 In the Swedish and Dutch case, both trends have \na similar shape over time, so that long-term environmental damage does not \ncontribute to a widening gap between ISEW and GDP.7 \nOne might think that even if long-term environmental damage is not accu-\nmulated over time, a threshold effect might still arise if marginal social costs per \ntonne of emitted carbon are assumed to increase over time. To let marginal so-\ncial costs increase over time is correct as the marginal social cost per tonne of \nemitted carbon is a positive function of the accumulated stock of carbon still \nresident in the atmosphere. In other words, the higher the historically accumu-\nlated carbon concentration in the atmosphere, the higher the social damage \ncaused by each additional unit of emitted carbon. Jackson et al. (1997, p. 24) ac-\ntually follow this approach in assuming \u2018firstly that the marginal social cost in \n1990 is equal to \u00a311.4 per tonne [of carbon, E.N.], and secondly that the mar-\nginal social cost in any year is proportional to the cumulative carbon emissions \nfrom the year 1900 up to that point in time [emphasis added].\u2019 It can be seen, \n                                                 \n6 The same result holds true for the Austrian, German and Italian ISEW, which is not shown \nhere for reasons of space limitations. \n18 \nhowever, from figure 2 for the UK ISEW that a threshold effect does not arise \neven if marginal social cost is increasing over time, as long as the annual dam-\nage itself is not accumulated over time. Whether a threshold effect can arise un-\nder differing, but still plausible assumptions about the rate of increase of mar-\nginal social cost deserves some further attention and cannot be ruled out at this \nstage with confidence. But at least for the UK ISEW, the only study so far using \nrising marginal social costs, the threshold effect fails to materialise. \n \n \n4. Adjustment for inequality \nAs concerns adjusting consumption expenditures for income inequalities, stud-\nies differ quite substantially on the method chosen, which is partly to be ex-\nplained by international differences in the availability of relevant data. It would \nbe beyond the scope of this paper to provide a full discussion here. Instead I \nwill concentrate on a fundamental difference between the approach taken in the \nUK ISEW and in the rest of the studies. \n \n4.1 Atkinson index or other indices? \nWhereas Jackson et al. (1997) use an index, which allows the choice of a parame-\nter representing society\u2019s aversion to inequality, all other studies use an index, \nmostly the Gini coefficient, which does not offer such a choice. Jackson et al. use \nthe so-called Atkinson index (Atkinson 1970), which is defined as: \n                                                                                                                                               \n7 The same result holds true for the Chilean ISEW (not shown here). \n19 \n \nAtkinson index = ( ) )1\/(1)1\/(1\/exp1 \u03b5\u2212\u03b5\u2212 \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\u2211\u2212 ii fYY  \n \nwhere Yi denotes the income of all individuals in the ith income group (n \ngroups altogether), fi denotes the proportion of the population with incomes in \nthe ith range; and Y  denotes the mean income. The extreme boundary cases are \n\u039c = 0, which implies no aversion to inequality whatsoever, and \u039c = \u0001, which \nimplies extreme aversion to income inequality in only taking account of trans-\nfers to the very lowest income group. \nThe great advantage of this approach is that in choosing \u039c, the researcher \nmakes explicit his or her implicit assumption on society\u2019s aversion to income \ninequality. Alternatively, the researcher can try to estimate \u039c from revealed \npreference studies of consumer behaviour. Pearce and Ulph (1995, p. 17), for \nexample, provide an estimate of \u039c for the UK from a survey of the empirical \nliterature with a lower bound of 0.7, an upper bound of 1.5 and a best estimate \nof 0.8.  \nIf instead, for example, the Gini coefficient is used, then usually one year is \nset as the base year for the index. In the US GPI, for example, which uses the \nGini coefficient, 1968 is set as 100, because \u2018it represented the lowest Gini coeffi-\ncient over the 1950-1998 period, thus the least income inequality. All other years \nare then compared to this benchmark\u2019 and an index is created (Redefining Pro-\ngress, 1999, p. 14). The inequality adjusted consumption expenditures are \nreached via dividing unadjusted expenditures by this index and multiplying \n20 \nwith 100. This approach is very ad hoc and the researcher\u2019s underlying assump-\ntions about society\u2019s aversion to income inequality are not explicated. With the \nAtkinson index, on the other hand, the researcher is forced to explicate his or \nher implicit assumptions regarding society\u2019s aversion to income inequality The \nresearcher can even attempt to minimise the influence of his or her own value \njudgements in trying to estimate society\u2019s revealed preferences. \n \n \n4.2 Index of welfare or sustainable income? \nIn using an index of inequality to adjust consumption expenditures, great care \nneeds to be applied to adequately interpret the resulting ISEW\/GPI. More gen-\nerally, as soon as indexing is applied to one of its items, interpretation must fol-\nlow either of two lines: First, the ISEW\/GPI can be interpreted as an index as \nwell. If so, then only changes in the index over time can meaningfully be inter-\npreted. For example, one can say that the ISEW\/GPI rose or fell in a certain \nyear by x per cent. The absolute level of the ISEW\/GPI, on the other hand, bears \nno meaning and should not be referred to then. Second, if the ISEW\/GPI is in-\nterpreted in absolute terms rather than as an index, then a statement is needed \non what the base year of indexing part of its components has been. This is be-\ncause the absolute level of ISEW\/GPI crucially depends on choosing a base year \nfor indexing as the reference point. Thus, the US GPI per capita in 1997, for ex-\nample, needs to be stated as follows: 6,521 in constant chained 1992 dollars with \nbase year 1968 for income inequality indexing. \n21 \nRelated to this point, the ISEW\/GPI needs to be interpreted as a measure of \nwelfare, not as sustainable or Hicksian income. Amongst other things, this is \nbecause due to the indexing the resulting ISEW\/GPI cannot be interpreted as \nthe income that society can safely consume and be as well off at the end of the \nyear as at the beginning. Daly and Cobb (1989, p. 84) were clearly aware of this \ncrucial point. Lately, however, this distinction seems to have become blurred. \nEngland (1998, p. 265), for example, in praising ISEW suggests that it \u2018is directly \ncomparable to gross domestic product\u2019. However, the absolute level of \nISEW\/GPI cannot be directly compared to the absolute level of GNP as the ab-\nsolute level of ISEW\/GPI is weighed by an index for income inequality, \nwhereas GNP is not. Meaningful comparison is confined to the trend of \nISEW\/GPI over time compared to the trend of GNP. \n \n \n5. Conclusion \nFrom the analysis above follow several recommendations for researchers who \nintend to update existing or create new studies of ISEW, GPI or related meas-\nures. First, if one uses the resource rent method for the valuation of non-\nrenewable resources, then the reference point should be national production of \nnon-renewable resource depletion, not consumption, and one should consider \nestimating user costs according to the El Serafy method instead of deducting \ntotal resource rents. Second, if one uses the replacement cost method, then the \nreference point should be national consumption of non-renewable resources, \nnot production, and some thought should be given to whether the totality of \n22 \nnon-renewable resources needs to be replaced in the present. More importantly, \nfuture researchers should seriously consider abandoning the 3% cost escalation \nfactor. Third, long-term environmental damage should not be accumulated, as \ndoing so leads to multiple counting. Fourth, future researchers should consider \nusing the Atkinson index if they want to adjust consumption expenditures for \nincome inequality, as this index demands explication of the implicit assumption \nabout society\u2019s aversion to inequality. Fifth, with indexing applied to any of its \nitems, the resulting ISEW\/GPI cannot be directly compared to GNP in absolute \nterms. While it is tempting to do so, no such comparison is meaningfully possi-\nble. Only trends over time can be compared. \nThe analysis in this paper has also shed some light on the robustness of the \n\u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019. It has been shown that if no escalation factor is applied \nto valuing the depletion of non-renewable resources and if long-term environ-\nmental damage is not accumulated, then none of these items contributes any \nlonger to a widening gap between ISEW\/GPI and GNP. The other environmen-\ntally related items in a typical ISEW\/GPI such as costs of water, air and noise \npollution generally do not contribute to such a gap either, as they do not grow \nfaster than GNP (for reasons of space they could not be dealt with here in more \ndetail). One can therefore conclude from the analysis above that variables re-\nlated to the environment do not provide evidence for the \u2018threshold hypothe-\nsis\u2019. They only do so, if a widening gap between ISEW\/GPI and GNP is artifi-\ncially created via the introduction of the 3% cost escalation factor and the accu-\nmulation of long-term environmental damage. \n23 \nThis does not provide sufficient evidence against the \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019 \nin general, as other factors covered by ISEW\/GPI might still create a widening, \nbut smaller, gap between ISEW\/GPI and GNP\/GDP. Related research has \nshown that, in general, the \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019 is not simply an artefact of \nthe cost escalation factor in non-renewable resource depletion and of the accu-\nmulation of long-term environmental damage in all studies (Saito, 1999). To \nanalyse the more general robustness of the \u2018threshold hypothesis\u2019, one needs to \nexamine each study in much more detail. Such a task would be beyond the \nscope of this paper and is the subject of ongoing research. What this paper has \ntried to show, however, is that the threshold, if existent, is not due to factors \nrelated to the environment. \n24 \nAppendix: Derivation of user costs according to the El Serafy method \nThe formula for computing user costs according to the El Serafy method is de-\nrived from the following reasoning (El Serafy, 1989): receipts from non-\nrenewable resource extraction should not fully count as \u2018sustainable income\u2019 \nbecause resource extraction leads to a lowering of the resource stock and thus \nbrings with it an element of depreciation of the capital that the resource stock \nrepresents. While the receipts from the resource stock will end at some finite \ntime, \u2018sustainable income\u2019 by definition must last forever. Hence, \u2018sustainable \nincome\u2019 is that part of resource rents which if received infinitely would have a \npresent value just equal to the present value of the finite stream of resource \nrents over the life-time of the resource. \nLet P be the resource price, AC average extraction cost, R the amount of re-\nsource produced (extracted), r the discount rate and n the number of remaining \nyears of the resource stock if production was the same in the future as in the \nbase year, i.e. n is the static reserves to production ratio. Then the present value \nof total resource rents RR \u2261 (P-AC)\u22c5R is equal to: \n \n \nr\nr\nRR\nr\nRR nn\ni i\n+\n\u2212\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n+\n\u2212\n=\u2211\n+\n+\n=\n1\n11\n)1(\n11\n)1(\n1\n0\n (1) \n \nThe present value of an infinite stream of \u2018sustainable income\u2019 SI is \n \n25 \n \nr\nSI\nr\nrSI\nr\nSI\ni i\n+\n\u2212\n=\n+\n=\u2211\n+\n\u221e\n=\n1\n11\n)1(\n)1(0\n (2) \n \nSetting (1) and (2) equal and rearranging expresses SI as a fraction of RR: \n \n \n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n+\n\u2212=\n+)1(\n11 1\nr\nRRSI\nn\n \n \nThe user costs, representing the depreciation of the resource stock, would thus \nbe \n \n \n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n+\n\u22c5\u2212=\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n+\n=\u2212\n++ )1(\n1)(\n)1(\n1)( 11\nr\nRACP\nr\nRRSIRR\nnn\n \n \nIf r > 0 and n > 0, then user costs are only a fraction of total resource rents \n(P-AC)\u22c5R. The higher is r, the lower are, ceteris paribus, user costs. This is be-\ncause a smaller share of resource rents has to be invested in an alternative form \nof capital in order to provide a sustainable alternative income stream if the rate \nof return on this alternative investment is higher. Similarly, the higher is n, the \nlower are user costs. This is because, for given resource production, a smaller \nshare of the total resource stock is used up. \n26 \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank Mako Saito for valuable research assistance.
