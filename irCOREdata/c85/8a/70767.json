In\nself-repair research, the examination of the aspects of timing can yield insights\ninto the psycholinguistic mechanisms of error detection, the functioning of\nthe monitor, as well as the difficulty and automaticity of the implementation\nof the correction. The analysis of timing data can also contribute to the empir-\nical validation of the various theories of monitoring.\nAt present, there are three basic psycholinguistic models of monitoring for\nwhich the analysis of the timing of self-repairs can be relevant: the editor the-\nories (Baars, Motley, & MacKay, 1975; Laver, 1980; Motley, Camden, & Baars,\n1982), the activation spreading theory (Berg, 1986; Dell, 1986; Dell &\nO\u2019Seaghda, 1991; MacKay, 1987, 1992; Stemberger, 1985), and the perceptual\nloop theory (Levelt, 1983, 1989, 1993; Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999; for a\nmore detailed review of the various theories of monitoring, see Kormos, 1999).\nEditor theories of monitoring assume that the editor can veto and replace the\nincorrect output of the speech production processes. In this model, the editor\nhas its own system of rules against which the output is checked (Baars et al.;\nMotley et al.). In order to account for the occurrence of errors, these theories\npresume that either the system of rules the editor uses is incomplete (e.g.,\nGarnsey & Dell, 1984) or the rules used at a given moment vary (e.g., Motley\net al.). The major shortcoming of such models is that the editor can only\ncheck the final outcome of the processes and is unable to intercept erroneous\noutput at intermediary levels. Several researchers working in the paradigm of\neditor theories of monitoring (e.g., Laver, 1980; Nooteboom, 1980) propose\nthat there should be a specialized monitor at each stage of the processing\nsystem, which checks the correctness of the outcome of each process. Such a\nmodel is called the distributed editor theory because the monitor has access to\nthe different stages of production.\nStemberger\u2019s (1985) and Dell\u2019s (1986) model of interactive activation spread-\ning in speech production is based on an interactive network of units (e.g.,\nwords, morphemes, phonemes), as well as generative rules that create slots\nfor the units. In this theory, decisions concerning which unit to select are\nmade on the basis of the activation levels of nodes representing these units.\nDell hypothesized that activation can spread in two directions: top-down (e.g.,\nfrom words to morphemes) and bottom-up (e.g., from phonemes to mor-\nphemes). He also assumed that speech perception proceeds through the bot-\ntom-up flow of activation and that this mechanism is in operation when\nspeakers monitor their own speech. Therefore, in this theory, monitoring is\n\u201can automatic by-product of bottom-up activation spreading\u201d (Berg, 1986, p.\n139). There are several problems with this conceptualization of monitoring.\nFirst of all, if errors are detected automatically, the monitor would perceive\nall errors, which, in turn, would be automatically corrected (Levelt, 1989). Em-\npirical research, however, proves that speakers do not correct every mistake\nThe Timing of Self-Repairs in Second Language 147\nin their speech (Levelt, 1983). Second, monitoring involves not only recogniz-\ning linguistically erroneous output but also perceiving the pragmatic inappro-\npriacy of the message and the inadequacy of the information conveyed\n(Levelt, 1983). The activation spreading models do not account for this signifi-\ncant aspect of monitoring at all (Levelt, 1992).\nLevelt (1983, 1989, 1993; Levelt et al., 1999) proposed a new model for mon-\nitoring: the perceptual loop theory. Based on Postma and Kolk (1992, 1993) and\nPostma, Kolk, and Povel\u2019s (1990) research, which lent proof to the existence\nof covert repairs, Levelt\u2019s perceptual loop theory adopts the idea that prear-\nticulatory output can be inspected. It was also proposed that the same mecha-\nnism could be applied both for checking one\u2019s own message and for\nperceiving and checking other speakers\u2019 utterances. In order to avoid the ne-\ncessity for reduplication of knowledge, in this model, the speech comprehen-\nsion system is used for attending to one\u2019s own speech as well as that of\nothers. In the model, there are three loops for inspecting the outcome of pro-\ncesses. The first loop is the phase when, before being sent to the formulator,\nthe preverbal plan, which specifies the speech-act intentions and their infor-\nmation structure, is compared to the speaker\u2019s original intentions. During the\nsecond loop, the message is monitored before articulation; this is called covert\nor prearticulatory monitoring (see also Postma & Kolk and Postma et al.). Fi-\nnally, the generated utterance is checked after articulation, which constitutes\nthe final, external loop of monitoring.\nAt present, only a few studies have investigated the exact timing of differ-\nent types of self-repairs and the relevance of timing data for different theories\nof monitoring (e.g., Blackmer & Mitton, 1991; Levelt, 1989; van Hest, 1996). Re-\nsearch on speech comprehension has shown that word recognition takes\nplace about 200 ms (milliseconds) after word onset (Marslen-Wilson & Tyler,\n1980). On the basis of this, Levelt (1989) assumed that, in the case of overt\nrepairs, the shortest time between the detection of the error and the cut-off\npoint is also 200 ms. He estimated that the recognition of one\u2019s internal\nspeech lasts for approximately 150 ms, and that the time between the delivery\nof the phonetic plan and the articulation is between 200 and 250 ms. Thus,\nspeakers have a maximum of 100 ms for prearticulatory monitoring, which\nmay not be enough to prevent the articulation of the erroneous utterance.\nThus, the erroneous word is interrupted shortly after its articulation begins\u2014\nthat is, the time between the onset of the error and the point of interruption\nwill be less than 200 ms. Because Levelt\u2019s (1989, 1993) model allows for paral-\nlel processing, it is possible that there is already some processed material\nready for articulation in the articulatory buffer; consequently, speakers can\nintercept erroneous output before it is articulated (covert repair).\nIn order to verify Levelt\u2019s (1989) estimations, Blackmer and Mitton (1991)\ncarried out an empirical study in which they found a high number of repairs\nwith short error-to-cut-off and cut-off-to-repair intervals (less than 150 ms).\nThey argued that, with respect to corrections with cut-off-to-repair intervals\nshorter than 150 ms, it is unlikely that utterance replanning could take place\n148 Judit Kormos\nwithin this period of time. Therefore, they assumed that speakers often start\nprocessing the repair before the flow of speech is interrupted. This hypothe-\nsis was confirmed by significant negative correlations between the error-to-\ncut-off and the cut-off-to-repair intervals in the case of fast repairs in their da-\ntabase. On the basis of these results, Blackmer and Mitton did not accept the\ncut-off point as a reliable measure of the point of error recognition, and they\nalso argued that the cut-off-to-repair intervals do not equal the total period of\ntime spent replanning the utterance. Additionally, the very short cut-off times\nfound in their study did not lend proof to the existence of distributed editors\n(Laver, 1980; Nooteboom, 1980), because in the distributed editor models, detec-\ntion is assumed to take at least 200 ms and parallel processing is not allowed.\nBecause the very fast repairs analyzed by Blackmer and Mitton (1991) oc-\ncurred infrequently in van Hest\u2019s (1996) study, which was based on a corpus\nof self-repairs produced by Dutch speakers both in their mother tongue and\nin English in three different types of tasks (picture description, story telling,\nand personal interview), she adopted a less rigid approach to analyzing the\ntiming of self-repairs. She assumed that the error-to-cut-off intervals are\nmainly indicative of the time of detection, and that the error-to-repair inter-\nvals signal the time spent replanning the utterance. The results of van Hest\u2019s\nproject suggest that phonological errors are detected and interrupted faster\nthan lexical errors, whereas inappropriate words seem to be recognized with\nthe slowest speed. Van Hest explained these findings by arguing that, in Lev-\nelt\u2019s (1989, 1993) model, the correction route of phonological errors is the\nshortest, as all the other types of errors or inappropriacies need to be\nchecked in the conceptualizer against the original communicative intention.\nThis study also revealed that the cut-off-to-repair intervals of L2 speakers\nwere longer than those in L1 speech, which van Hest assumed was due to a\nlower degree of automatization of the L2 production processes. The effect of\nL2 proficiency on the timing of self-repairs, however, was not investigated in\nthis study.\nAs can be seen from this literature review, only one study investigated the\ntiming of various L2 self-repairs (van Hest, 1996). There is a great need, how-\never, for comprehensive research that involves typologically more different\nlanguages than Dutch and English. Studies utilizing reliable tools of data analy-\nsis are also needed because they have immediate relevance for the theory of\nL2 speech production. The research reported here attempts to explore in\ngreater depth, by means of modern computer technology, the timing of vari-\nous subtypes of self-repairs.\nIn order to enhance the reliability of the classification of self-corrections,\nretrospective verbal reports were also collected. Two main issues were inves-\ntigated in this respect: (a) What underlying psycholinguistic processes are in-\ndicated by the differences in the timing of various types of self-corrections?;\nand (b) how does the level of proficiency influence the speed of error detec-\ntion and the execution of the correction? I will begin by describing the method\nof data collection, the classification of self-repairs, and the analysis of the tim-\nThe Timing of Self-Repairs in Second Language 149\nTable 1.

The findings are then presented and discussed. Finally, the\neffect of proficiency on the speed of error recognition and the implementation\nof repairs is examined.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\nThe participants in the study were 30 native speakers of Hungarian. Ten parti-\ncipants attended an exam preparation course in a language school. Their ages\nranged from 16 to 22 years. Ten subjects attended an evening course for re-\ntraining teachers at Eo\u00a8tvo\u00a8s University, Budapest, and were between 25 and 35\nyears old. Ten students studied English as day students at Eo\u00a8tvo\u00a8s University\nand were from 19 to 22 years old. Based on their proficiency test scores (the\nprocedures used for measuring their proficiency are discussed in the next sec-\ntion), the participants were classified as advanced speakers (more than 54\npoints out of 63; Group 3), upper-intermediate speakers (between 53 and 41\npoints; Group 2), and pre-intermediate learners (below 40 points; Group 1).\nThe proficiency levels of the three groups were found to be significantly differ-\nent from each other, F = 130.45, p < .001 (see Table 1).\nSetting and Procedures\nThe proficiency test administered to the participants was a C-test, in which\nevery second half of every second word had been deleted. C-tests have\nproven to be a fairly reliable measure of global L2 competence (e.g., Do\u00a8rnyei &\nKatona, 1992; Klein-Braley, 1985; Klein-Braley & Raatz, 1984). The test used in\nthis study was validated by Do\u00a8rnyei and Katona, who correlated the achieve-\nment of both university and secondary school students on the C-test and the\nTOEIC (Test of English for International Communication), which is considered\nto be a highly reliable measure of language proficiency.1 The C-test adminis-\ntered to the participants consisted of three texts with 21 gaps each.\nFollowing administration of the C-test, the subjects were interviewed one\nby one. First, the participants were asked to act out an approximately 5-min-\n150 Judit Kormos\nute-long information-gap-type role-play activity adapted from Jones (1991, p.\n218) with the researcher as the interlocutor. The subjects\u2019 task was to answer\nan inquiry concerning a private room in a restaurant. Instructions and the nec-\nessary background information were provided in the subjects\u2019 native lan-\nguage.\nThe role-play task was followed by a 25- to 35-minute-long retrospective in-\nterview, conducted in the subjects\u2019 native language. In this interview, the par-\nticipants, upon listening to their own speech, were requested to recall what\nproblems they experienced in formulating their message in the L2 and how\nthey had tried to solve these problems. The retrospective interview was con-\nducted on the basis of guidelines set up by Ericsson and Simon (1980, 1993)\nto ensure the reliability of the data.\nThe performance of the task and the subsequent retrospective interview\nwere both video and audio recorded. The transcriptions of the tasks were\ndone by trained transcribers and were checked by the researcher. The retro-\nspective interviews were transcribed by the researcher.\nAnalysis\nWith the help of the retrospective comments, a psycholinguistic system of\nclassifying the self-repairs found in the corpus was devised on the basis of\nprevious taxonomies of self-corrections (Bre\u00b4dart, 1991; Levelt, 1983; for a de-\ntailed discussion of the taxonomy, see Kormos, 1998a, 1999). Four major\ngroups of self-repairs were distinguished: different information, appropriacy,\nerror, and rephrasing. Owing to the small number of self-corrections of the\nvarious subtypes within the major groups of self-repairs, I only discuss the\nfour main groups of self-repairs here (subtypes are listed and illustrated with\nexamples in the Appendix).\nThe first main group of corrections is the different-information repair,\nwhich is used when speakers decide to encode different information than\nwhat they are currently formulating (Levelt, 1983). An example is given in (1).\n(1) You have to we have to make a contract. (different-information repair)\nRetrospection: I realized that it is stupid to say that you have to make a contract, it\u2019s\nthe restaurant that has to write it.\nThe second main type of repair is the appropriacy repair, which differs\nfrom different-information repairs because it is employed when the speaker\ndecides to encode the originally intended information in a modified way (Lev-\nelt, 1983). Speakers resort to appropriacy repairs, as in (2), when they have\nencoded information that needs to be made more precise, more coherent,\npragmatically more appropriate, or less ambiguous.\n(2) There are er er twenty er tables er about twenty tables. (appropriacy repair)\nRetrospection: Here I was thinking about the number of the tables in the restaurant.\nThe Timing of Self-Repairs in Second Language 151\nThe third main category\u2014error repairs\u2014involves mechanisms different\nfrom those of the two main correction types just discussed: In this case,\nspeakers repair an accidental lapse, as in (3). Such lapses can occur at every\nphase of speech processing, that is, while accessing words, grammatical and\nphonological encoding, and articulating (for a detailed review of mechanisms\nof speech processing, see Levelt, 1989; Levelt et al., 1999).\n(3) You have to er rent it er for 35 person um it\u2019s max . . . minimum minimum yes. (error\nrepair)\nRetrospection: I realized that I was not using the right word. It\u2019s not maximum, but\nminimum, since it is a room for 40 people.\nThe fourth main type of repair, a rephrasing repair, involves revising the\nform of the speaker\u2019s original message without changing its content. In this\ncase, the speaker repeats a slightly modified version of a word or phrase be-\ncause of uncertainty about its correctness, by either adding something or par-\naphrasing, or both. Rephrasing repairs are different from error repairs in that\nerror repairs merely involve the correction of accidental lapses and, conse-\nquently, the issuing of the same preverbal plan in an unmodified form,\nwhereas rephrasing repairs are signs of a lack of L2 competence:\n(4) We will er reflect er to you in another letter we will answer you. (rephrasing repair)\nRetrospection: What happened here was that I was not sure whether \u201creflect\u201d really\nmeans \u201canswer.\u201d I knew what \u201creflect\u201d means, but I do not know whether you can\nuse it for writing as well, that is, whether it means the same in writing as in speech\nthat you \u201creflect\u201d on something.\nA digital recording of all the self-repairs found in the corpus was made.\nThese digitized recordings were then entered into a computer. For analyzing\nthe length of pauses, a computer program called Goldwave was used. This\nprogram can display amplitude and time-wave forms as well as create spectro-\ngrams with the help of a built-in double oscilloscope. By means of the parallel\nanalysis of the spectrograms, the time-wave forms, and the transcripts, it was\npossible to establish the length of the necessary stretches of speech in milli-\nseconds. Out of the 289 self-corrections, only 282 could be examined accu-\nrately, owing to the sometimes poor quality of the recordings. In the case of\neach correction, the time between the onset of the error and the point at\nwhich the flow of speech was interrupted (i.e., the cut-off point), the interval\nbetween the cut-off point and the onset of the repair, and the length of the\nreparatum (i.e., the correction itself) were measured in milliseconds. The total\ntime of the self-repair was calculated by adding up the length of these three\nphases in the correction processes. In order to gain an accurate picture of the\nplanning mechanisms involved in making the repairs, corrections containing\nlexical editing terms (n = 50) were excluded from the statistical analyses of the\ncut-off-to-repair intervals and the total time of self-repairs. Therefore, the cut-\noff-to-repair intervals and the total time of self-repairs were analyzed in a data-\n152 Judit Kormos\nTable 2.

In or-\nder to enhance the reliability of the analysis, their utterances were digitized\nby means of the Goldwave computer program, with the help of which the ex-\nact length of time they spent speaking, including pause time, was measured.\nThe number of syllables was counted manually, and the speech rate was cal-\nculated by dividing the number of syllables by the total number of seconds\nthe participants spent speaking.\nAll the data obtained as a result of these analyses were computer coded\nand processed by the SPSS statistical package.\nDIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF VARIOUS CLASSES\nOF SELF-REPAIRS\nResults\nThe results of analyzing the timing of the four main self-repair groups indicate\nthat the type of self-correction affects all of the variables investigated in the\nstudy. Table 2 provides an overview of the error-to-cut-off and cut-off-to-repair\nintervals, the length of the reparatum, and the total repair times of the various\ntypes of repairs.2\nThe one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the difference between the\ntiming of different types of repairs (see Table 3) and the consecutive Scheffe\u00b4\ntest showed that error repairs were interrupted significantly earlier, F = 6.28,\np < .05, than appropriacy, rephrasing, and different-information repairs.

Furthermore, corrections of\nlexical errors took less time than those concerning inappropriate information\n(i.e., different-information repairs) or insufficient information (i.e., appro-\npriate-level-of-information repairs), and also took less time than rephrasing re-\npairs, F = 5.35, p < .001. Finally, the total length of inappropriate-information\nrepairs was longer than that of repairs for good language, F = 5.35, p < .001.\nDiscussion\nOn the basis of the arguments put forward in Blackmer and Mitton\u2019s (1991)\nstudy\u2014namely, that the error-to-cut-off intervals and the cut-off-to-repair in-\ntervals were not reliable measures\u2014firm conclusions concerning error detec-\ntion and the execution of the repair processes could not be drawn based on\nthe variables investigated in the project. The present study, however, differed\nfrom that of Blackmer and Mitton in that its participants were nonbalanced\nbilingual speakers of English who are only partially capable of executing the\nmechanisms of speech processing parallel and, therefore, they may not be\nable to start replanning a new message before interrupting an erroneous or\ninappropriate utterance. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that repairs\nwith cut-off-to-repair times under 150 ms (n = 13) constituted only 4.8% of the\ncorrections analyzed, and these were all exclusively produced by participants\nbelonging to the advanced group. Therefore, there is sufficient reason to as-\nsume that, in this study, the error-to-cut-off times and the cut-off-to-repair\ntimes in the majority of the repairs (95.2%) mainly reflect intervals necessary\nfor error detection and planning the correction. Thus, these variables can be\nused as reliable measures of the detection and planning times respectively\n(see van Hest, 1996, for a similar line of argumentation).\nError-to-Cut-off Times. The results of the analysis of the error-to-cut-off\ntimes suggest that linguistic errors are detected significantly earlier than inap-\npropriate (appropriacy repairs) or false information (different-information re-\npairs) and output of the correctness of which speakers are uncertain\n(rephrasing repairs). This order of detecting errors is parallel to the bottom-\nup sequence of decoding processes in comprehension. In linear models of\ncomprehension, phonological decoding is assumed to take place first, fol-\nlowed by lexical access, syntactic decoding, and discourse processing (e.g.,\nForster, 1979). The results indicating that the detection of inappropriate or\nfalse information takes longer than the detection of phonological, lexical, and\ngrammatical errors can be explained with reference to the hypothesis of linear\nbottom-up speech comprehension theories\u2014namely, that discourse process-\ning constitutes the last step in decoding the output (e.g., Forster).\n156 Judit Kormos\nAs previously mentioned, in the case of rephrasing repairs, speakers expe-\nrience problems comparing their output with the existing L2 linguistic system\nbecause it does not contain all the relevant information for the monitor to be\nable to decide with certainty that the process of linguistic encoding was erro-\nneous. As the results also suggest, the inability to make this judgment slows\ndown the detection process to a considerable extent.\nWith respect to the detection times of specific subtypes of self-repairs, it\nwas assumed that, owing to the fact that phonological decoding takes place\nfirst in linear bottom-up models of speech comprehension, the detection times\nof phonological errors would be shorter than those of lexical errors (van Hest,\n1996). In the present study, however, no significant differences were found be-\ntween the error-to-cut-off intervals of these two types of self-corrections. On\nthe one hand, this finding might be due to the relatively small number of pho-\nnological-error repairs in the corpus. On the other hand, it might suggest that\nlinear bottom-up models of speech comprehension are not able to account for\nprocesses of monitoring. Recent theories of comprehension assume that there\nis an interaction between levels of processing and that mechanisms of com-\nprehension take place in parallel fashion (e.g., Marslen-Wilson, 1987; Marslen-\nWilson & Tyler, 1980; McClelland & Elman, 1986; Tyler & Warren, 1987). In the\ncase of detecting phonological and semantic errors in one\u2019s own output, this\nwould mean that speakers attend to both types of errors simultaneously\nrather than in a serial manner.\nThe parallel and interactive nature of speech comprehension and levels of\nmonitoring is also supported by the result that corrections of ambiguous, in-\ncoherent, and pragmatically inappropriate lexical choice, as well as repairs for\ngood language, showed detection patterns similar to those of lexical errors.\nMoreover, pragmatic-appropriacy repairs and repairs for good language were\ndistinctively different from inappropriate-information repairs. On the one\nhand, the importance of this finding lies in the fact that it supports the as-\nsumption that lemmas might contain specifications concerning not only their\nphonological form, argument structure, and semantic form (Bierwisch &\nSchreuder, 1992), but their pragmatic value as well (Do\u00a8rnyei & Kormos, 1998).\nTherefore, upon parsing the utterance, the monitor might compare the in-\ntended pragmatic force of the selected lexical entry simultaneously while\nchecking its phonological, grammatical, and semantic features, which is re-\nflected in the similar detection times of lexical-error and pragmatic-appropri-\nacy repairs. On the other hand, the results also suggest that checking the\ndiscourse-level aspects of the utterance, such as the use of coherent and un-\nambiguous terms, proceeds simultaneously with lexical decoding and the\ncomparison of the message\u2019s informational content with its communicative in-\ntention. This finding lends additional support to the existence of parallel and\ninteractive mechanisms in speech comprehension and monitoring.\nIt can be concluded that the findings concerning the error-to-cut-off times\nof self-repairs support both the activation spreading theories (Berg, 1986; Dell,\n1986; Dell & O\u2019Seaghda, 1991; MacKay, 1987; Stemberger, 1985) and the per-\nThe Timing of Self-Repairs in Second Language 157\nceptual loop theory of monitoring (Levelt, 1989, 1993; Levelt et al., 1999) be-\ncause both models assume that monitoring mechanisms are similar to\ncomprehension processes. The fact that repairs with shorter than 150-ms er-\nror-to-cut-off times also occurred in the corpus rules out the possible exis-\ntence of distributed editors in L2 speech (e.g., Laver, 1980), because in these\nmodels the minimum time necessary for detection is 150 ms (Levelt, 1989).\nCut-off-to-Repair Times. The analysis of the cut-off-to-repair times of the\nmain self-repair groups revealed that speakers need a considerably longer pe-\nriod of time to replan their utterance if they have to implement a major\nchange in the information to be conveyed (different-information repairs). In\nthe case of error repairs, the preverbal plan does not need to be modified;\nthus, the cut-off-to-repair intervals mainly indicate the time necessary for the\nlinguistic processing of the correction. With respect to appropriacy repairs,\none part of the utterance needs further specification, which, as shown by the\nresults, does not last considerably longer than processing the unmodified pre-\nverbal message. Upon analyzing the rephrasing repairs in the corpus, it was\nfound that the two most frequent strategies applied in this case were approxi-\nmation and restructuring (Kormos, 1998b). Approximation involves changing\none chunk of the preverbal message, usually by deleting one or more concep-\ntual specifications and restructuring a shift in the focus or topic of the utter-\nance in the microplanning phase (Do\u00a8rnyei & Kormos, 1998; Poulisse, 1993).\nThe findings concerning the timing of rephrasing repairs indicate that such\nalterations of the preverbal message do not require considerable effort, be-\ncause the execution of rephrasing repairs does not last significantly longer\nthan that of error repairs. These results lend strong support to the assump-\ntion that, in the case of uncertainty in the correctness of a lexical entry, the\npsycholinguistically simplest strategies tend to be used because they require\nlittle processing effort (Kormos, 1998b).\nWith respect to the specific subtypes of self-corrections, the results sug-\ngest that it is only message-replacement repairs that differ significantly from\nmost other types of corrections. Therefore, it can be assumed that replanning\nthe utterance takes the longest if the previous message is completely aban-\ndoned and a totally new one needs to be encoded. On the basis of analyzing\nthe cut-off-to-repair intervals of the different types of self-repairs, it can be\nconcluded that small-scale modifications of the linguistic form and the infor-\nmation content do not considerably increase the cognitive load of replanning\nthe message. Major changes in the informational content, however, require\nsignificantly greater processing effort, which is reflected in the extended inter-\nval between the point at which the flow of speech is interrupted and the onset\nof the correction.\nThe finding that, in a small number of cases (4.8% of the repairs, all pro-\nduced by advanced learners), the cut-off-to-repair times were shorter than 150\nms shows that highly proficient L2 speakers can occasionally plan the repair in\nthe process of articulating the error. This implies that certain participants were\n158 Judit Kormos\nable to execute detection and planning in parallel, which rules out theories in\nwhich only serial processing is allowed (e.g., Laver, 1980; Nooteboom, 1980).\nThe Length of the Reparatum and the Total Time of Self-Repairs. The\nlength of the reparatum and the total time of self-repairs are not directly indic-\native of the planning and detection processes, but they do reveal the amount\nof the necessary changes in the form of the utterance. Thus, it is understand-\nable that different-information repairs take the longest time to complete (be-\ncause the complete previous message needs to be replaced). With respect to\nerror, pragmatic-appropriacy, and rephrasing repairs, as well as repairs for\ngood language, however, it is mainly one word that is substituted with an-\nother; therefore, these repairs do not last as long as conveying reordered or\nmodified information.\nTHE EFFECT OF PROFICIENCY ON THE TIMING OF SELF-REPAIRS\nResults\nFirst, a correlational analysis of the frequency of the various types of self-\nrepairs and the participants\u2019 proficiency measure was conducted. Learners\nwith a high proficiency level produced significantly fewer error repairs, r =\n\u2212.43, p = .01, and more appropriacy repairs, r = .36, p = .04, than their less pro-\nficient peers. The frequency of different-information, r = .01, p = .96, and re-\nphrasing repairs, r = \u2212.06, p = .75, however, was not found to correlate with the\nlevel of L2 proficiency.\nA correlational analysis of the C-test scores and the four timing variables\nof self-repairs in general was also conducted. The results did not show any\nsignificant correlation between the level of proficiency and the timing of self-\nrepairs in general (see Table 6). Additionally, the correlational analysis of the\nC-test scores and the timing measures of the main self-repair groups did not\nreveal any proficiency effect in the case of the error-to-cut-off intervals and\nthe length of the reparatum of error, appropriacy, different-information, and\nrephrasing repairs (see Table 6). Moreover, the total length of the correction\nand the cut-off-to-repair intervals of different-information and rephrasing re-\npairs were not influenced by the participants\u2019 proficiency level. As can be\nseen in Table 6, the length of the cut-off-to-repair intervals and the total time\nof the repair in the case of appropriacy repairs were found to be affected by\nthe students\u2019 level of L2 proficiency. In the speech of learners at a higher pro-\nficiency level, the cut-off-to-repair intervals of appropriacy repairs were\nshorter than in the speech of their less proficient peers, r = \u2212.32, p = .02. Addi-\ntionally, the more proficient the participants were, the shorter the total length\nof appropriacy repairs was, r = \u2212.30, p = .03. The results also showed that the\nlevel of L2 proficiency influences the length of the cut-off-to-repair intervals of\nerror repairs, r = .29, p = .01. The correlational analysis indicated that the\nspeech rate of the participants was affected by L2 proficiency, r = .78, p < .001.\nThe Timing of Self-Repairs in Second Language 159\nTable 6.

Speakers with an increased level of L2 profi-\nciency can be assumed to detect errors and execute correction with aug-\nmented speed, but at the same time, they produce fewer error repairs\n(Kormos, 1998b; O\u2019Connor, 1988; van Hest, 1996). Because error repairs are\nsignificantly shorter than appropriacy and different-information repairs (see\nTables 2 and 3), the timing differences investigated separately in the case of\nthe main self-repair groups are better indicators of the effect of proficiency on\nthe various measures of timing.\nError-to-Cut-off Times. In a related study, van Hest (1996) did not find any\nsignificant differences between L1 and L2 error-to-cut-off times. The results of\nthe present project also indicate that learners at various levels of L2 profi-\nciency do not differ with respect to the length of the error-to-cut-off intervals\nin any of the main self-repair groups. These findings strongly suggest that the\nspeed of error detection is not significantly affected by L2 proficiency. The\nreason for the similarity of detection times across groups of learners at differ-\nent proficiency levels could be that monitoring involves the use of compre-\nhension processes, which are generally fast, and the lack of L2 proficiency\ndoes not slow them down to a considerable extent.\nCut-off-to-Repair Times. The effect of proficiency on the cut-off-to-repair\nintervals of error and appropriacy repairs can be explained with reference to\ndifferences in the automatization of the speech-encoding mechanisms at vari-\nous levels of L2 proficiency. During the processing of appropriacy repairs,\nspeakers only need to implement minor changes in the informational content\nof the preverbal plan, whereas error repairs do not require a modification in\n160 Judit Kormos\nthis respect. Therefore, it was concluded that, in these cases, cut-off-to-repair\ntimes indicate the length of the linguistic processing of the preverbal plan,\nthat is, lexical, grammatical, and phonological encoding. Because the degree\nof the automatization of these encoding processes is assumed to be higher\nwith increased proficiency (de Bot, 1992; DeKeyser, 1997; Towell, Hawkins, &\nBazergui, 1996), highly proficient learners can execute them faster than speak-\ners at a low level of L2 proficiency. In this respect, the findings presented here\nare also supported by van Hest\u2019s (1996) research, in which the cut-off-to-\nrepair intervals of appropriacy repairs were significantly shorter in the L1\nthan in the L2. It must be noted, however, that the definition of appropriacy\nrepairs in the present study is slightly different from that of van Hest, who\nalso included repairs for syntactic and tense-and-aspect appropriateness in\nthe category of appropriacy repairs.\nDespite the assumption outlined above (i.e., that rephrasing repairs also\ninvolve a small-scale change in the preverbal plan), the level of L2 proficiency\ndid not affect the length of the cut-off-to-repair intervals in the case of this\ncorrection type. Perhaps this is because, regardless of the level of L2 profi-\nciency, learners have to face a problem when implementing rephrasing, which\nmight slow down the execution of the correction to a similar extent in the\ncase of all three groups of participants. Regarding different-information re-\npairs, the cognitive load of replanning the informational content of the prever-\nbal message affects repair-processing speed similarly across groups at\ndifferent levels of L2 proficiency.\nThe Length of the Reparatum. The length of the reparatum did not seem\nto be influenced by the participants\u2019 proficiency level in any of the main self-\nrepair groups. The reason for the lack of significant differences in the present\nstudy may be that, as argued above, speakers mainly used the cut-off-to-repair\nintervals for planning and processing the reparatum. Therefore, upon making\nthe repair, the already planned and processed bits of the reparatum are artic-\nulated. Despite the fact that the speech rate was found to significantly corre-\nlate with the proficiency level of the learners, it is likely that the articulation\nrate (i.e., the amount of time necessary for producing the utterance, excluding\npause time, divided by utterance length) in such short stretches as a repara-\ntum does not noticeably vary with proficiency level. Although the articulation\nrate of the participants was not measured, Towell et al.\u2019s (1996) findings lend\nsupport to the assumption that the level of L2 proficiency does not signifi-\ncantly affect this timing variable. In their study, which investigated the devel-\nopment of fluency of advanced learners of French, articulation rate was found\nto be a less reliable indicator of fluency than speech rate or the mean length\nof fluent runs.\nThe Total Time of Self-Repairs. The results concerning the differences in\nthe total time of self-repairs suggest that a higher degree of automatization\nonly results in a faster manner of remedying the problematic part of the utter-\nance in the case of appropriacy repairs. The comparison of the error-to-repair\nThe Timing of Self-Repairs in Second Language 161\ntimes in L1 and L2 in van Hest\u2019s (1996) study yielded identical results. Even\nthough there were differences in the cut-off-to-repair intervals of error repairs\namong learners at different proficiency levels, it seems that, owing to the fact\nthat error repairs are generally short and fast (see Tables 2 and 3), these dif-\nferences are not reflected in the total time of error repairs. In the case of dif-\nferent-information and rephrasing repairs, none of the phases of correction\nimplementation were found to vary significantly across groups of differing pro-\nficiency levels; consequently, the total time of the execution of the repair can-\nnot be expected to vary, either.\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this analysis of the timing of self-repairs provide valuable infor-\nmation on the psycholinguistic processes of monitoring. One interesting find-\ning in this respect is that, on the basis of the difference in the detection times\nof error, appropriacy, and different-information repairs, the assumption of\nboth the activation spreading theory and the perceptual loop theory\u2014that\nmonitoring involves the same mechanisms as speech comprehension\u2014gained\nsupport. The study also reveals that the speed of detecting pragmatically in-\nappropriate words and lexical errors was very similar, which might mean that,\nduring monitoring, the pragmatic features of the lexical entry are checked si-\nmultaneously with its phonological and semantic form, as well as its argument\nstructure. This finding therefore provides indirect evidence for the assump-\ntion that lexical entries do not contain only phonological, semantic, and gram-\nmatical specifications, but also information concerning their pragmatic value\n(Do\u00a8rnyei & Kormos, 1998). The analysis of detection times supported the dis-\ntinction of error and rephrasing repairs, because it revealed that speakers\u2019 un-\ncertainty about correctness of the utterance in the case of rephrasing repairs\nslows down the detection process to a considerable extent.\nThe findings concerning the cut-off-to-repair intervals yielded valuable in-\nformation concerning the replanning of the utterance when carrying out self-\ncorrections. The results indicate that slight modifications in linguistic form\n(e.g., error and rephrasing repairs) and informational content (e.g., appro-\npriate-level-of-information repairs) take less time to implement\u2014that is, they\nrequire less processing effort\u2014than large-scale changes in the informational\ncontent of the message (e.g., message-abandonment repairs). The similarity of\nthe time periods necessary for replanning the utterance, in the case of error\nrepairs and rephrasing repairs, strongly confirms the assumption that L2\nspeakers use the psycholinguistically simplest strategies in the case of uncer-\ntainty about the correctness of the output.\nAnalysis of the effect of proficiency on repair times revealed that, owing to\nthe fact that comprehension mechanisms used for error detection are gener-\nally fast, the level of L2 proficiency does not influence them to a considerable\nextent. In the case of self-corrections that do not require major modification\nto the preverbal plan (e.g., error and appropriacy repairs), however, differ-\n162 Judit Kormos\nences between low- and high-level learners were found in the times necessary\nfor reprocessing the utterance. Because during the production of these re-\npairs only a minor change is needed in the preverbal plan, it can be assumed\nthat the cut-off-to-repair intervals mainly reflect the time necessary for the lex-\nical, grammatical, and phonological encoding of the correction. Thus, in the\ncase of proficient speakers, the high level of automaticity of these mecha-\nnisms can result in the speeding up of speech processing. This difference be-\ntween learners at various levels of L2 proficiency, however, disappears if they\nhave to face a problem (i.e., upon implementing rephrasing). The speed of\nproducing the correction was not found to be affected by L2 proficiency ei-\nther, which can be explained with reference to the fact that this interval re-\nflects the time necessary for articulating the already planned and processed\nbits of the message.\nFinally, it should be noted that the number of self-repairs found in the pres-\nent corpus was not sufficient to establish significant differences in the timing\nof certain subtypes of self-repairs. A larger database is needed for a more de-\ntailed study of the detection times of different errors and inappropriacies. For\ncompiling a larger corpus, however, not only do elicited speech production\ndata need to be collected, but research under laboratory conditions is neces-\nsary as well (van Hest, 1996).\nAnother shortcoming of the research project described here is that no L1\ndata was collected from participants; consequently, their performance in their\nL1 and L2 could not be contrasted. Moreover, the comparison of the results\nof this study with previous research findings was not without problems, given\nthe differing taxonomies used in this and previous studies.\n(Received 2 February 1999)\nNOTES\n1. The results of the comparison of the TOEIC and the C-test showed relatively high correlations\nboth in the case of university and secondary school students (r = .65 for university students, r = .64\nfor secondary school students). The results of Do\u00a8rnyei and Katona\u2019s (1992) study also indicated that,\ndespite the fact that the difficulty level of the C-test varies across groups of learners at different\nproficiency levels, its measuring ability remains stable.\n2. As shown in Table 2, the various measures of the timing of a number of self-repair types show\nhigh variability because many of the standard deviation values are relatively high. Nevertheless, the\nfrequency polygons of the timing measures have shown that the distributions of these measures are\nnot skewed. Therefore, the means are the best measures of central tendency, which allows for the\nuse of parametric statistical procedures such as correlations or the one-way analysis of variance.\n3. The correction rate of errors was not investigated in this study. For background information,\nit can be noted that participants corrected approximately 20% of their lexical errors and 15% of their\ngrammatical inaccuracies (for further details, see Kormos, 1998b).\nREFERENCES\nBaars, B.
