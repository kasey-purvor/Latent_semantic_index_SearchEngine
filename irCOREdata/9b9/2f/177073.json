Methods\/Design: A postal questionnaire of non-affected relatives of people with Paget's disease. The sample will include relatives of Paget's patients with a family history of Paget's disease and relatives of Paget's patients without a family history of Paget's disease. The questionnaire will explore whether a range of factors relate to acceptability of a programme of genetic testing and preventive treatment in relatives of Paget's disease sufferers. The questionnaire will include several measures: illness representations (as measured by the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire); treatment representations (as measured by Theory of Planned Behaviour-based question items, informed by a prior interview elicitation study); descriptive and demographic details; and questions exploring family environment and beliefs of other important people. Data will also be collected from family members who have been diagnosed with Paget's disease to describe the disease presentation and its distribution within a family.

Genetic factors play a role in PDB and genetic\ntests are now conducted for research purposes. It is thus timely to investigate the potential for a\nclinical programme of genetic testing and preventative treatment for people who have a family\nhistory of PDB. This study examines the beliefs of relatives of people with PDB. It focuses\nparticularly on illness and treatment representations as predictors of the acceptability and uptake\nof potential clinical programmes. Illness representations are examined using Leventhal's Common\nSense Self-Regulation Model while cognitions about treatment behaviours (acceptance of testing\nand treatment uptake) are conceptualised within the Theory of Planned Behaviour.\nMethods\/Design: A postal questionnaire of non-affected relatives of people with Paget's disease.\nThe sample will include relatives of Paget's patients with a family history of Paget's disease and\nrelatives of Paget's patients without a family history of Paget's disease. The questionnaire will explore\nwhether a range of factors relate to acceptability of a programme of genetic testing and preventive\ntreatment in relatives of Paget's disease sufferers. The questionnaire will include several measures:\nPublished: 29 May 2008\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 doi:10.1186\/1472-6963-8-116\nReceived: 22 February 2008\nAccepted: 29 May 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116\n\u00a9 2008 Langston et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116illness representations (as measured by the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire); treatment\nrepresentations (as measured by Theory of Planned Behaviour-based question items, informed by\na prior interview elicitation study); descriptive and demographic details; and questions exploring\nfamily environment and beliefs of other important people.\nData will also be collected from family members who have been diagnosed with Paget's disease to\ndescribe the disease presentation and its distribution within a family.\nDiscussion: The answers to these measures will inform the feasibility of a programme of genetic\ntesting and preventive treatment for individuals who are at a high risk of developing Paget's disease\nbecause they carry an appropriate genetic mutation. They will also contribute to theoretical and\nempirical approaches to predicting diagnostic and treatment behaviours from the combined\ntheoretical models.\nBackground\nThe need for this research\nOver recent years, advances in human molecular genetics\nhave resulted in the identification of polymorphisms and\nmutations in several genes that cause or predispose to dis-\neases such as cancer, neurodegenerative conditions and\ninborn errors of metabolism. For some of these condi-\ntions, such as Huntington's disease and Muscular Dystro-\nphy, it is possible to offer a genetic test that will give\ninformation on the probability of the disease occurring.\nFor other diseases, such as hypercholesterolaemia and\nhaemochromatosis, identification of genetic susceptibil-\nity can be used as a risk factor to inform management\nstrategies and treatment decisions in a similar way to\nother clinical risk factors.\nThe process of exploring the feasibility of new biomedical\ndevelopments includes the likely uptake of new tests and\ntreatments.\nFor example, offering a test to inform on the probability\nof the disease occurring may be somewhat unattractive to\npatients without the prospect of an effective treatment. In\norder to ascertain whether biomedical research will be\ntranslated into health care practice, understanding and\npredicting behaviour is of paramount importance. Trans-\nlation of genetic knowledge about Paget's disease into\npractice requires information on the following:\n(i) Are people with Paget's disease willing to let their rela-\ntives to know of their diagnosis?\n(ii) Are people who are genetically related to people with\nPaget's disease identifiable and happy to be contacted?\n(iii) Are medical practitioners likely to refer relatives for\ngenetic testing?\n(iv) Are these relatives likely to take a test?\n(v) if such a test is positive, are medical practitioners likely\nto prescribe preventive treatment? and\n(vi) Are the relatives likely to adhere to such treatment?\nThis study concerns points (i), (ii), (iv) and (vi) in this\nsequence.\nThus, this study aims to test the feasibility of translating\ngenetic knowledge into practice by examining the accept-\nability of offering genetic testing, followed by therapeutic\nintervention, to relatives of people with a genetic disease.\nThe study will use established models of social cognition\nwithin the field of behavioural science to achieve this.\nThis study will focus on Paget's disease of bone, for which\ngenetic mutations have been identified, and potential\neffective treatments exist.\nPaget's disease of bone\nPaget's disease of bone (PDB) is a common disorder that\naffects about 2% of individuals over the age of 55 in the\nUK [1]. It is characterised by focal increases in osteoclastic\nbone resorption, coupled to increased and disorganised\nbone formation affecting one or more bones throughout\nthe skeleton. Some patients are asymptomatic, but others\ndevelop complications such as bone pain, bone deform-\nity, pathological fracture, deafness and secondary osteoar-\nthritis [1]. These complications cause loss of mobility and\nindependence, and adversely affect quality of life [2].\nGenetic factors play an important role in PDB and in 15\u2013\n40% of families, the disease is inherited as an autosomal\ndominant trait [3-5]. Mutations have now been identified\nin four genes that predispose to PDB and related diseases\n(reviewed by Daroszewska & Ralston [6]) but the most\nimportant of these is SQSTM1 which is a common cause\nof classical Paget's disease. About 40% of patients with a\nfamilial PDB in the UK carry SQSTM1 mutations as do 9%\nof patients with \"sporadic\" PDB [7,8]. The proportion of\nSQSTM1 mutation carriers is higher in the French Cana-Page 2 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116dian population where 50% of familial PDB patients and\n20% of \"sporadic\" patients have SQSTM1 mutations [9].\nIndividuals with SQSTM1 mutations are severely affected.\nThe age at diagnosis is about 10 years younger and the dis-\nease is more extensive than in PDB patients without\nSQSTM1 mutations [7]. Twelve different mutations of\nSQSTM1 have been described in patients with PDB and all\nof these cluster in or around the ubiquitin associated\n(UBA) domain [10].\nFunctional studies have shown that SQSTM1 mutations\ncause loss of ubiquitin binding [10], suggesting that this\nmay be a unifying mechanism by which the disease\noccurs, although research is still ongoing to determine\nhow this leads to osteoclast activation.\nA few examples have been recorded where carriers of\nSQSTM1 mutations have not developed PDB, even by the\nseventh decade [9]. This has led to the suggestion that\nenvironmental factors such as measles virus infection\nmight interact with SQSTM1 mutations to cause PDB\n[11]. The contribution of viral infection to the pathogen-\nesis of PDB remains controversial, however [12,13]. In\nany case, irrespective of the possible contribution of envi-\nronmental factors, between 80%\u201390% of SQSTM1 carri-\ners develop PDB by the sixth or seventh decade [7,9,14].\nImportantly, mutations of SQSTM1 are highly specific for\nPDB and have not been found in unaffected age matched\ncontrols derived from the general population in any of the\nstudies that have been performed so far [9,14-17].\nProgress in understanding the role of SQSTM1 in the\npathogenesis of PDB has been accompanied by major\nadvances in treatment of the condition.\nIn view of this, it is timely to investigate the clinical poten-\ntial for a programme of genetic testing and preventive\ntreatment for patients who carry SQSTM1 mutations, in\nan effort to prevent or delay the development of Paget's\ndisease.\nProspects for preventing Paget's disease\nAminobisphosphonates such as Risedronate, Pamidro-\nnate and Zoledronate have emerged as highly effective\nagents for reducing bone turnover and treating bone pain\nin patients with Paget's disease [18]. Recent studies have\nshown that a single infusion of the fourth generation ami-\nnobisphosphonate, Zoledronic acid, can restore alkaline\nphosphatase levels to normal in about 90% of cases [19].\nIn the vast majority of these patients, alkaline phos-\nphatase levels have remained normal for 24 months after\nthe infusion [20]. There is also evidence to suggest that\nstandard courses of treatment with intravenous Pamidro-\nnate and oral Risedronate can suppress bone resorption in\nactive Paget's disease for up to two years [21,22].\nThis raises the possibility that patients who carry SQSTM1\nmutations, and who are at high risk of developing Paget's\ndisease, could be offered prophylactic therapy, in an\nattempt to prevent the disease occurring, or to prevent\ncomplications developing. With the existence of effective\ntreatment that could prevent the onset of disease, we need\nto explore the acceptability of genetic testing followed by\npreventive treatment.\nAcceptability of genetic testing and preventive treatment\nIn light of these developments in Paget's disease, it is\ntimely to investigate whether genetic testing and preven-\ntive treatment are acceptable to the relatives of Paget's dis-\nease patients. 'Acceptability' has been conceptualised to\nmean the following behaviours:\n\u2022 whether relatives of people with Paget's disease would\naccept such a test if it were offered;\n\u2022 whether they would accept preventive treatment for\nPaget's disease, if it were recommended by doctors; and\n\u2022 if so, what type of treatment (e.g. tablet or injection)\nthey would be prepared to accept, if it were offered.\nWe have taken a theoretical approach to exploring accept-\nability by utilising the construct of intention toward the\nkey behaviours contained within recognised social cogni-\ntion models [23]. Intention to engage in each of the above\nthree behaviours are our measures of acceptability. Within\nsocial cognition models, intention is a strong predictor of\nbehaviour. While it is recognised that there is a gap\nbetween intention and actual behaviour [24] i.e. intenders\ndo not always carry out the behaviour, it is very rare for\nnon-intenders to do so [25]. In addition, the gap between\nother cognitions and behaviours is even greater [26]. For\nexample, attitudes to the tests and proposed treatments\ni.e. the extent to which an individual is favourable toward\nthem, are likely to be less predictive of subsequent behav-\niours than intentions to engage in the behaviour of accept-\ning tests and treatment, as shown by Fishbein's seminal\nwork in the 1960s.\nPossible factors that could affect acceptability of genetic \ntesting and preventive treatment\nNevertheless, evidence from other areas of genetic testing\nsuggests that patients who say they wish to undertake\ngenetic testing may not actually take up the offer of such a\ntest.\nIn Huntington's disease, for example, prior to the devel-\nopment of a genetic test, individuals at risk declared a\nmuch higher intention of taking a test than the actual\nnumbers taking the test when it became available [27].\nAlthough some people who stated having the intention toPage 3 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116take a test did not actually act on this intention, none of\nthose people who did not hold this intention actually\ntook the test. Measuring intentions is, therefore, impor-\ntant as it can very accurately identify those who will defi-\nnitely not take a test.\nCognitions about genetic conditions in general can also\ninfluence acceptability of genetic tests. For example, stud-\nies have shown that there is a widespread belief that\ngenetic conditions are not treatable. Such beliefs might\naffect the acceptability of screening for and treatment of\ngenetic conditions. However, the additional offer of effec-\ntive preventive treatment can make genetic testing more\nacceptable [28]. It is, therefore, important to understand\nthe complex issues surrounding acceptability and uptake\nprior to the development of new technologies to maxim-\nise the efficiency of health service provision.\nBeliefs\nEvidence from other, non-genetic, conditions, for which\nthere are effective treatments, demonstrates that patients'\ncognitions may affect their intentions and therefore\nuptake of treatment. Two groups of cognitions, represen-\ntations about illness; and beliefs about behaviours that\nconstitute uptake of screening and treatment are likely to\nbe influential.\nIllness representations\nIllness representations describe how people see their ill-\nness. This is most clearly outlined in the Common Sense\nSelf-Regulation Model (CSSRM) [29]. The term 'self-regu-\nlation' is defined here as 'processes of goal setting and goal\nattainment' in response to a threat to health. The five key\nbeliefs that are the components of illness representations\nare:\n\u2022 identity (e.g. the 'label', identifying symptoms);\n\u2022 cause (e.g. stress, genetics);\n\u2022 consequences (e.g. activity limitations, loss of wages);\n\u2022 timeline (e.g. acute, fluctuating, progressing);\n\u2022 cure\/control (e.g. medication, rehabilitation exercises,\nprior perceived risk of developing the disease);\nThe model proposes that it is these perceptions, rather\nthan the medical representations, that guide the person's\nself-regulating efforts. In addition, the CSSRM identifies\nthe emotional representation (e.g. frustrating, frightening) as\na separate dimension of representation. Based on this\nmodel, Weinman and colleagues [30] have developed a\nmeasure, the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (IPQ), to\nassess these representations and have found that they are\npredictive of uptake and response to a wide variety of\ntreatments, including the bone disease Rheumatoid\nArthritis [31]. Clearly, such perceptions may influence\nuptake of a new treatment offered to families with Paget's\ndisease. Indeed, Marteau has shown that beliefs affect the\ndecision to accept a genetic test [28].\nMoss-Morris et al [32] have subsequently developed a\nrevised version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire\n(IPQ-R) to include illness coherence (e.g. the condition is\nunderstandable versus confusing). A brief version of the\nIPQ-R has also been developed by Broadbent et al [33].\nThe Brief IPQ provides a rapid assessment of illness per-\nceptions that is quick and easy for participants to com-\nplete.\nPaget's disease has a highly variable presentation: age at\nonset, severity of symptoms and impact on sufferers' lives;\nand individuals might vary in their response to an offer of\ntesting and treatment depending on the disease history\nwithin their family. Using the World Health Organisation\nInternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and\nHealth model of health components [34], one might\nexpect that perceptions about all three components\n(impairment, activity limitations, and participation\nrestrictions) might affect beliefs about the identity, conse-\nquences and timeline of the condition.\nTreatment representations\nTreatment representations describe how people perceive\npotential treatments for their disease. There is considera-\nble evidence that patients' beliefs about taking treatments\n(e.g. ease of access, burden, perceived likelihood of suc-\ncessful consequences) influence uptake and adherence\n[35]. A programme of genetic testing and treatment\nrequires considerable behavioural input from the individ-\nual and their representations of what is involved rather\nthan the objective programme of treatment, are likely to\ndetermine their willingness to participate.\nCognitions about the behaviours involved in uptake in \nuptake\nThe Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is a theoretical\nmodel (see Figure 1), which predicts intentions and\nbehaviour from people's beliefs about the consequences,\nsocial pressures and perceived control over the behaviour,\nincluding uptake of testing and uptake of treatment [36].\nThe TPB proposes that intention to perform a given\nbehaviour is shaped by a person's attitude, subjective\nnorms and perceived behavioural control relating to that\nbehaviour and gives clear guidance on how to operation-\nalise these constructs.Page 4 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116Attitude\nA person's attitude to a behaviour (i.e. whether they eval-\nuative it positively or negatively) is shaped by their behav-\nioural beliefs (beliefs about the consequences of the\nbehaviour e.g. whether it will improve or prevent them\nhaving Paget's disease), and their outcome evaluations\n(the positive or negative features of the consequences of\nthe behaviour e.g. whether they consider avoiding Paget's\ndisease to be important).\nSubjective Norms\nA person's own perception of the beliefs and practices of\nsignificant others (individuals or groups) as to whether\nthese significant others would approve or disapprove of\nthe behaviour, and the person's own motivation to com-\nply with these pressures. Subjective norms are shaped by\nbeliefs concerning how socially desirable or undesirable it\nis to perform the behaviour e.g. whether they believe their\nrelatives would wish them to have genetic testing.\nPerceived Behavioural Control\nBeliefs about factors that make it easy or difficult for a per-\nson to enact the behaviour combined with beliefs about\nthe power of those factors to enable them to enact the\nbehaviour. Control beliefs can be internal (e.g. informa-\ntion, skills, abilities) or situational (e.g. opportunities,\nbarriers, dependence on others) e.g. whether the individ-\nual believes that genetic testing is possible for them.\nIntention\nIntention is the index of acceptability of genetic testing\nand treatment for this study. It is the strength of motiva-\ntion to enact the behaviour. The model describes how\npeople are more likely to engage in attractive behaviours\nover which they have high levels of control. Behaviours\nthat carry high levels of intention and perceived behav-\nioural control should produce strong motivation to actu-\nally enact the behaviour. It is, therefore, possible to\nproduce a questionnaire based on the TPB model to pre-\ndict intention to perform a given behaviour, such as\nuptake of a genetic test or preventive treatment, i.e. accept-\nability.\nThe nature of the treatment and treatment offer\nThe nature of the treatment, and the way in which the\ntreatment is offered, may affect acceptability. One needs\nto consider not only how to invite the affected individual\nto 'involve' their family, but also how to introduce the\nprogramme to invited family members. Hardeman et al\n[37] in the Pro-Active Programme, have developed an\ninterview for families of people with Type 2 diabetes that\nincorporates the offer of the intervention for offspring.\nThis interview was based on the data from interviews used\nto develop questionnaires for the Theory of Planned\nBehaviour (TPB) addressing beliefs about involving the\noffspring in the programme. It has proved very effective in\nrendering the programme acceptable.\nIn addition, the treatment offered for Paget's disease could\nbe in tablet or infusion form, and could be administered\nin a range of environments. All of these factors may influ-\nence the acceptability of a programme of genetic testing\nand preventive treatment and will be explored in this\nstudy.\nDemographic and health characteristics\nDemographic and health-status characteristics may also\ninfluence people's illness perceptions as well as their\nbeliefs about the behaviours involved and hence the\nacceptability of treatment. For example, someone who is\nolder may think they are less at risk if they have passed the\nage of onset of Paget's disease in the affected person; or\nthey may think they are nearing the time when the disease\nmight affect them; or they may think they are less likely to\nbenefit. Closeness to the affected person may make them\nview the condition as more or less serious, and they may\nbe influenced by how the affected person copes with the\nillness. Furthermore, one might expect there to be more\nagreement within members of one family than between\nfamilies due to their shared exposure to the condition as\nwell as their opportunity to discuss and influence each\nother (Figure 2).\nWe will therefore investigate how Paget's disease has\naffected the proband, using the three health components\nof the International Classification of Functioning [34] to\ncharacterise the consequences of the disease, i.e. we will\nassess impairment of body functioning and structure,\nactivity limitations and participation restrictions.\nScientific value of this study\nThis project takes advantage of recent advances in knowl-\nedge about the molecular-genetic basis of PDB, with\nDiagrammatic representation of the Theory of Planned BehaviourFigure 1\nDiagrammatic representation of the Theory of \nPlanned Behaviour.Page 5 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116advances in therapeutics to address an important clinical\nquestion that is of relevance to patients with Paget's dis-\nease and their families. The project provides added value\nin that modern techniques and models in behavioural sci-\nence will be applied to a specific issue in the treatment of\nPaget's disease, while at the same time investigating more\ngeneral theories of human behaviour. Using the Common\nSense Model of Self-Regulation, we will investigate how\ngenetic information and preventive opportunities affect\nself-regulation via illness representations and, using the\nTheory of Planned Behaviour, how the behaviour of\nuptake of the offer of genetic testing and treatment is pre-\ndicted by the constructs found to predict behaviour in\nother settings. Thus, the findings will be relevant to these\ntheories. They will also contribute to ongoing work to\nintegrate these two models in understanding cognitions\nand behaviour related to illness threats [38].\nIn addition, the knowledge gained from this investigation\nwould be relevant to other musculoskeletal diseases such\nas osteoporosis, which also have a strong genetic compo-\nnent, and which can be prevented by bisphosphonates\nand hormone replacement therapy. With completion of\nthe human genome project, and advances in human\nmolecular genetics, it is probable that DNA testing with\nsingle genetic markers or combinations of markers will be\noffered for a wide range of other chronic diseases for\nwhich effective treatments are available. The results of the\npresent research project will also be of direct relevance to\nthe development of programmes of genetic testing and\npreventive intervention for these conditions.\nStudy Aim\nThe aims of this study are to understand factors that might\ninfluence the acceptability of an offer of a programme of\ngenetic screening and preventive treatment to families of\nPaget's disease sufferers.\nThe specific research questions are:\nStage 1. (already completed [39])\na): What do individuals with Paget's disease think would\ninfluence the involvement of their relatives in a pro-\ngramme of genetic testing and preventive treatment? and;\nb) What do relatives of Paget's disease sufferers think\nwould influence them in accepting an offer of a pro-\ngramme of genetic testing and preventive treatment?\nStage 2. (the focus of this protocol)\nDo the following factors relate to acceptability of a pro-\ngramme of genetic testing and preventive treatment in rel-\natives of people with Paget's disease:\n\u2022 Illness and emotional representations of Paget's disease;\n\u2022 Treatment representations;\n\u2022 Presentation of the disease in affected relative(s) (age at\nonset, impairment, activity limitations, participation\nrestrictions; family history as a function of the number of\naffected relatives and the relationship to the Respondent);\n\u2022 Respondent characteristics (age, gender and health);\n\u2022 Cognitions about having a test and taking preventive\ntreatment;\n\u2022 The nature of the treatment offered.\nBy answering these research questions, this study will cast\nlight on the feasibility of developing a programme of\ngenetic testing and preventive treatment for individuals\nwho are at high risk of developing Paget's disease because\nthey carry SQSTM1 mutations. We do not yet know\nwhether prophylactic bisphosphonate therapy would be\neffective in preventing Paget's disease, however, we envis-\nage that the results of the present study would be used to\ninform the rationale of a randomised controlled trial to\ninvestigate the efficacy of prophylactic bisphosphonate\ntherapy in people with SQSTM1 mutations. Such a study\nwould form the basis of a future research project.\nMethods\/Design\nThis research project has 2 stages.\nA model of the relationship between explanatory and dependent variablesFigure 2\nA model of the relationship between explanatory and \ndependent variables.Page 6 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116Stage 1\nThis part of the study is completed and addressed the first\nresearch question [39]. It aimed to identify factors that\nwould influence involvement of relatives not known to\nhave Paget's disease in a programme of genetic screening\nand preventive treatment. Stage 1 employed semi-struc-\ntured interviews developed to elicit CS-SRM constructs\nand to form a basis for developing an Illness Perception\nQuestionnaire [32] for individuals suffering from Paget's\ndisease. It also employed Theory of Planned Behaviour\n(TPB)-based interviews [40], with their relatives who had\nnot been diagnosed as suffering from Paget's disease to\nelicit beliefs about the consequences of the behaviours of\naccepting testing and treatment, about the views of impor-\ntant others regarding these behaviours and about whether\nthese behaviours were easy or difficult for the respondent.\nThe results of Stage 1 have been used to inform the devel-\nopment of this protocol and the questionnaire for Stage 2.\nStage 2\nThis part of the study is the focus of this protocol. The\nStage 2 has been reviewed and approved by Lothian\nResearch Ethics Committee 1 (ref: 07\/S1101\/13). It will\ncomprise a postal questionnaire study of people without\nPaget's disease but who are relatives of people with Paget's\ndisease. This part of the study will address the second\nresearch question.\nTwo sets of individuals will be identified:\n(1) Relatives of Paget's patients with a family history of\nPaget's disease (i.e. known history of Paget's disease in\nmore than one blood relative);\n(2) Relatives of Paget's patients without a known family\nhistory of Paget's disease (i.e. known history of Paget's dis-\nease in only one blood relative).\nThis stage aims to quantitatively assess the effect of a range\nof factors on the acceptability of a programme of genetic\ntesting and preventive treatment in families with and\nwithout a family history of Paget's disease. The question-\nnaire is likely to consist of several measures: illness repre-\nsentations (as measured by the Brief Illness Perception\nQuestionnaire [33]); treatment representations (as meas-\nured by a TPB-based questionnaire informed by Stage 1\n[39]); a series of dependent variables exploring the accept-\nability of testing and treatment and the feasibility of a\nclinical trial of preventive treatment; questions collecting\ndescriptive and demographic details; and questions\nexploring family environment and beliefs of other family\nmembers.\nData will also be collected from probands to describe the\ndisease presentation and its distribution within a family.\nThe data from questionnaires completed by relatives will\nbe analysed along with available data on members of the\nfamily with diagnosed Paget's disease (probands and\nother affected family members).\nParticipants and recruitment\nIndividuals with Paget's disease will be identified, in the\nfirst instance, from two established cohorts: The PRISM\ntrial and The Paget's Disease Family Register (PDFR).\nProbands and relatives from the PDFR cohort, and\nprobands from the PRISM cohort, have previously given\ntheir consent to future contact regarding Paget's disease\nresearch (see Table 1 for additional details of how these\nindividuals were approached).\nWe can identify in total, 254 probands with a family his-\ntory of Paget's disease, and 1020 individuals without a\nfamily history of Paget's disease from these cohorts.\nThe PRISM Cohort\nThe PRISM cohort involves 1331 patients with Paget's dis-\nease from 39 collaborating centres ranging in size from 3\ntrial participants to approx 250 trial participants. Twenty\nof these centres have agreed to allow us to approach their\npatients for this study. We already know from the baseline\nevaluation that approximately 172 individuals in PRISM\nhave a family history of Paget's disease, whereas 1020\nindividuals do not.\nThe Paget's Disease Family Register (PDFR)\nWe will also enrol participants with a family history of\nPaget's disease from the PDFR. This register currently com-\nprises 49 probands and their affected and unaffected rela-\ntives from around the world. Families for this study have\nbeen enrolled from the UK [16]. These participants have\nalready taken part in genetic mapping studies that resulted\nTable 1: Approach to potential participants to invite them to participate in the GaP study\nPRISM PDFR Edinburgh NARPD\nProbands Approach directly (after \nconsultation with caring physician)\nApproach directly (after \nconsultation with caring physician)\nApproach directly (after \nconsultation with caring physician)\nApproach directly\nRelatives Approach via proband Approach directly (after \nconsultation with caring physician)\nApproach via proband Approach via probandPage 7 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116in the identification of SQSTM1 mutations as a cause of\nPaget's disease [3,8]. New families are being included on\nan ongoing basis and these figures are subject to change.\nIdentifying and Contacting Participants\nIn the first instance, probands will be identified from both\nthe PRISM and PDFR cohorts. For the PRISM cohort, all\nparticipants who have died, become unwell or who have\nwithdrawn from the PRISM study are recorded on the\nPRISM database, and these participants will not be con-\ntacted for this study. For the PDFR cohort, every attempt\nwill be made to avoid making inappropriate contact using\na variety of methods. For example, where possible the sta-\ntus of probands will be checked with their caring physi-\ncian\/consultant.\nIf there is a high non-response from the PDFR and PRISM\ncohorts, we will identify probands from additional\ncohorts.\nContacting PRISM probands\nProbands identified from the PRISM cohorts will be con-\ntacted by post. A letter will be sent to all probands\ntogether with a study information leaflet, inviting them to\ncomplete a questionnaire. Probands will also be asked to\nprovide contact details of relatives over the age of 18 who\nmay also like to participate. PRISM probands have previ-\nously been asked if they are happy to be contacted about\nnew research projects, and only those agreeing to this will\nbe contacted.\nContacting relatives of PRISM probands\nA letter will be sent to relatives identified by probands\ntogether with a study information leaflet, inviting them to\ncomplete a questionnaire.\nContacting probands and relatives from the PDFR cohort\nA letter will be sent to probands and relatives identified\nfrom the PDFR together with a study information leaflet,\ninviting them to complete a questionnaire.\nQuestionnaire reminders\nNon-response will be interpreted as a desire not to take\npart in the study. If no response has been received by the\nstudy office (Aberdeen) or Chief Investigator's office\n(Edinburgh) to the initial mailing, participants will not\nreceive any subsequent questionnaire reminders or fur-\nther contact from the study office.\nSample Size\nGiven that most of these individuals have already engaged\nin research, we anticipate a high participation rate and\nestimate that 70% of probands will have living blood rel-\natives and will be happy to contact their relatives. Based\nupon the experience of a recent study of familial hyperc-\nholestorolaemia [41] it is anticipated that an average of 2\nrelatives per participating proband will participate. The\nrecommended minimum sample is calculated as 50 + 8\nm, where m is the number of predictor variables [42]. This\nstudy has a total number of 26 predictor variables and the\nminimum sample size required is 258 relatives.\nWe anticipate that there will be a clustering effect of\nresponses within families. The size of clustering effect is\ndetermined by the intra cluster correlation, and the sam-\nple size needs to be inflated to reflect this correlation [43].\nWe have no prior evidence of the possible size of this clus-\ntering effect, so assuming that the study has an average\ncluster size of 2 relatives per proband and that the correla-\ntion was 1 (the worst case scenario), the inflation factor\nwould be 2. We therefore intend to recruit a minimum of\n516 relatives to account for this effect. To achieve this it\nwill be necessary to approach a minimum of 369\nprobands (accounting for 70% participation rate). We\nintend to approach a random sample of 200 probands\nwith a known family history of Paget's disease, and 200\nwithout.\nExclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria include:\n\u2022 Unable to read or write English; or\n\u2022 Aged less than 18 years; or\n\u2022 Known* limited life expectancy (under one year)\n* The caveat of 'known' is used, as it may not be possible to\ndetermine limited life expectancy of relatives.\nWe have not made special arrangements for non-English\nspeaking participants for two reasons:\n\u2022 Paget's disease is extremely rare in non-Caucasians and\ntherefore we anticipate that English will be the first lan-\nguage of virtually all, eligible individuals within the UK.\n\u2022 The instruments used in this study (in particular the\nBIPQ and TPB) are sophisticated and sensitive tools for\nmeasuring an individual's perceptions of treatment and\nillness. Translating these measures into alternative lan-\nguages necessitates re-validation of these instruments,\nwhich would require considerable investment of time and\nfinancial resources that are not available for this study.\nIndividuals with limited life expectancy are excluded from\nStage 2 of the study as the process of completing a ques-\ntionnaire may be cognitively and emotionally taxing for\nthem.Page 8 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116A lower age limit has been imposed (minimum age of 18\nyears). Clinical studies suggest that people with SQSTM1\nmutations develop Paget's disease from approximately 45\nyears of age onwards [7]. Clinical intuition would suggest\nthat starting a programme of preventive treatment at age\n40 years would therefore be appropriate. The clinical evi-\ndence to support this, however, is still lacking. In addi-\ntion, it is likely that a psychologically 'acceptable' age for\nbeginning preventive treatment will differ from that indi-\ncated by existing evidence. As such, we propose to include\nall adult relatives of probands to determine the effect of\nage of the acceptability of genetic testing, and preventive\ntreatment.\nConsent Process\nAlthough implied consent will be assumed if a subject\ncompletes and returns a questionnaire, we have addition-\nally incorporated a brief consent form into the question-\nnaire to ensure that the following points are clearly\nunderstood:\n\u2022 The general purpose of the study and questionnaire are\nunderstood;\n\u2022 That the subject can withdraw from the study at any time\nand if they specifically request it, their data will be\ndestroyed;\n\u2022 The data is collected and securely stored by the Despatch\nOffice in Edinburgh;\n\u2022 We are not able to offer a genetic test or preventive treat-\nment for Paget's disease as part of this study;\n\u2022 That a summary of the results can be sent to them if they\nindicate agreement.\nIt is explicitly stated in the consent forms and question-\nnaires that participants can withdraw from the study at\nany time by contacting the study office and, if requested,\ntheir data will be destroyed.\nThe consent form incorporated into the questionnaires\nwill also contain a tick box for participants to indicate\nwhether they wish contact about future research projects\nconcerning Paget's disease.\nMeasures\nA questionnaire will be sent to probands. This question-\nnaire will include:\n\u2022 Details of disease presentation in the proband;\n\u2022 An overview of the family structure;\n\u2022 Details of relatives to contact.\nA questionnaire will be sent to first and second-degree rel-\natives of probands. This questionnaire will include spe-\ncific measures of:\n\u2022 All variables hypothesised to affect the likelihood of\nuptake of a programme of genetic testing and preventive\ntreatment (potential explanatory variables; see section\n6.1); and\n\u2022 Dependent variables measuring the acceptability or\nintention to take up an offer of a programme of genetic\ntesting and preventive treatment.\nIn addition, each section of the questionnaire will have a\nsection of open questions.\nPotential explanatory variables\nIllness and Emotional Representations\nIllness and Emotional Representation will be assessed\nusing the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) [33])\nadapted for Paget's disease of bone. This is a very widely\nused predictive measure. Adaptations for specific condi-\ntions are part of the standard use of the questionnaire and\nProfessor Weinman will provide critical feedback relating\nto the adapted measure before use. Appropriateness of\nitems will also be tested for Discriminant Content Validity\n[44].\nRepresentations of Testing and Treatment Behaviours\nBased on Stage 1 interviews, a questionnaire will be\ndesigned to assess beliefs about the behaviours involved\nin accepting a programme of genetic testing and preven-\ntive treatment, using TPB constructs and methods. The\nconstructs are:\n\u2022 attitudes to accepting a programme of genetic testing and\npreventive treatment;\n\u2022 subjective norm refers to beliefs that important others\nwould wish one to accept or not;\n\u2022 perceived behavioural control refers to beliefs that a pro-\ngramme of genetic testing and treatment will be offered\nwhich they are able to accept; and\nThese constructs will be assessed using standard TPB\nmethods [40] and based on beliefs (behavioural, norma-\ntive and control) elicited in Stage 1. All measures will con-\ntain at least 3 items so that reliability can be assessed and\nwill be subjected to psychometric analyses.Page 9 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116Respondent characteristics\nAge, gender, marital and employment status; relationship\nwith affected person(s), number of affected relatives; self-\nassessed health as measured by SF-12 and self-assessed\nhealth on standard 4-point rating scale (excellent, good,\nfair, poor).\nPresentation of the disease in affected relative(s)\nThe following data will be collected from the proband:\nage at onset, previous fracture, previous bone surgery and\nthe number of bones affected by Paget's disease. In addi-\ntion, the SF-36 will give standardised measures of impair-\nment, activity limitations, and participation restriction,\nbased on previous work on the relationship between this\nmeasure and the ICF health components [45].\nDependent variable: Acceptability of a programme of \ngenetic testing and preventive treatment\nAcceptability will be assessed through: intention to accept\na test if offered and intention to accept preventive treat-\nment if recommended by doctors. In addition, relatives'\nperceptions of the feasibility of taking preventive treat-\nment will be measured through perceived behavioural\ncontrol of particular forms of treatment. Intention and\nperceived behavioural control will be assessed using\nstandard TPB methods [40].\nMeasures will be developed to assess probability of accept-\nance, using both numerical and verbal-rating scales and\nguidance from work on presenting probabilistic risk data.\nUsing the TPB it is possible to measure intention and to\nassess the probability of engaging in the described behav-\niour. Information from Stage 1 interviews will be used for\ncontent, phrasing and context, and piloted in interviews\nuntil satisfactory. Participants will be specifically asked\nwhether they would take up a programme of genetic test-\ning and preventive treatment if it were to become availa-\nble. In addition, we would specifically investigate the\nacceptability of the following options: preventive treat-\nment options (tablet or infusion); and location of clinical\nintervention for preventive treatment (primary or second-\nary care; regional specialist centres or local.\nData collection\nPotential participants will be assigned a unique study\nnumber. This information will be held on a password-\nprotected database\/spreadsheet at the University of Edin-\nburgh.\nQuestionnaires will be pre-labelled with these study num-\nbers and posted to the corresponding potential partici-\npants. Questionnaires will be identifiable by the unique\nstudy number only.\nProbands and relatives will be asked to complete and\nreturn the questionnaire in a reply-paid envelope. Help in\ncompleting the questionnaire will be available if required.\nIf the patient is known to have difficulty writing (for\nexample due to severe arthritis), is deaf or blind, special\narrangements will be made for completion of the ques-\ntionnaires.\nAnne Langston, the Chief Investigator, and a data man-\nager based at the Queen's Medical Research Institute,\nEdinburgh, will coordinate the administration of ques-\ntionnaires and data management. Stage 2 will therefore be\nadministrated from this site, and will be Sponsored by the\nUniversity of Edinburgh.\nData will be returned by participants to the Edinburgh\nOffice. There it will be entered onto an electronic database\n(password protected and stored on secure University\nserver). An experienced data clerk will enter the data from\nquestionnaires into this database. Anonymous data from\nthis database will be transferred to the GaP study office at\nthe University of Aberdeen for statistical analysis.\nQuality Assurance\nFull verification checks will be undertaken at the time of\ndata capture. A random 10% sample of data will be dou-\nble entered to check accuracy. Extensive range and consist-\nency checks will further enhance the quality of the data.\nAnalysis\nStage 2 data analyses will involve psychometric assess-\nment of developed and adapted measures. The main anal-\nyses will be carried out by a statistician in collaboration\nwith Jill Francis, an expert in the psychometrics and anal-\nysis of theoretically based measures and analyses. and will\ninvolve multiple and logistic regression; this will be\napproached systematically, starting with analyses for each\ntheoretical approach and then for each group of variables\nto identify significant predictors which will then be\nbrought into an overall predictive equation.\nAnswers to open ended questions will be analysed to clar-\nify content. The analysis of open questions will not\ninvolve a full qualitative analysis of all responses, but\ninstead will be analysed as required to aid interpretation\nof quantitative results. Members of the research team will\ncarry out this analysis. Detailed qualitative analysis may\nbe carried out in the future and will be subject to separate\nfunding and ethical approval.\nEnd of Study procedures\nDuring the consent process for the study we will ascertain\nwhether participants would like to be sent a report of the\nstudy results.Page 10 of 13\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:116 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/8\/116For those participants indicating that they would like\nstudy results, a short report will be prepared and circu-\nlated at the end of the study.\nQuestionnaires will be stored in locked filing cabinets\nuntil the study is complete, and will then be anonymised\nand archived for 20 years in accordance with Medical\nResearch Council guidelines.
