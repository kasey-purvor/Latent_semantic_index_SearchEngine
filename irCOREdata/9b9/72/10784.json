However, a single ACSA may provide an inadequate estimate of muscle mass. Therefore, we investigated whether quadriceps muscle volume can be adequately estimated from a single ACSA. In 18 adult males we derived regression equations from which estimates of volume were made. These equations were based on the direct assessment of volume using 11 transverse-plane MRI scans along the entire length of the femur (the gold standard). We estimated volume based on single scans at 40, 50 and 60% of femur length (from the distal end). All estimates of quadriceps volumes were highly correlated to the measured volume and demonstrated a low level of error. R (2) = 0.84, 0.93, 0.90 (all P < 0.01), standard error of estimate (SEE) = 26.8 +\/- 5.2, 12.5 +\/- 5.4 and 9.9 +\/- 5.7%, for single scans taken at 40, 50 and 60% of femur length respectively. In comparison, when volume was estimated using multiple MRI scans corresponding to the maximum ACSA of each muscle the estimate was even better [R (2) = 0.95 (P < 0.01) and SEE = 4.5 +\/- 2.7%]. Substituting ACSA from a single MRI scan at 60% of femur length into a previously determined regression equation allows for an estimation of muscle volume with a 10% error of estimate.<\/dc:description><dc:description>The original publication is available at http:\/\/www.springer.com\/<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>Springer-Verlag<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-05-14T14:59:00Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:format>YES<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>European journal of applied physiology, 2007, vol. 100, no. 3, pp. 267-74<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1439-6319<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>17342544<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1007\/s00421-007-0429-4<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/11813<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1439-6327<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/link.springer.de\/link\/service\/journals\/00421\/index.htm<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/ym114m418hru7112\/fulltext.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":null,"relations":["http:\/\/link.springer.de\/link\/service\/journals\/00421\/index.htm","http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/ym114m418hru7112\/fulltext.pdf"],"year":2007,"topics":["Anatomical cross-sectional area","Quadriceps volume","Muscle mass"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":null}
