We conducted a systematic study to \nidentify and compare the ethical issues raised in 54 letters to researchers about the same 18 applications \nsubmitted to three RECs over one year. The most common type of ethical trouble identified in REC letters \nrelated to informed consent, followed by scientific design and conduct, care and protection of research \nparticipants, confidentiality, recruitment and documentation. Community considerations were least \nfrequently raised. There was evidence of variability in the ethical troubles identified and the remedies \nrecommended. This analysis suggests that some principles may be more institutionalised than others, and \noffers some evidence of inconsistency between RECs. Inconsistency is often treated as evidence of \nincompetence and caprice, but a more sophisticated understanding of the role of RECs and their \nfunctioning is required. \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nResearch Ethics Committees (RECs), have an important role in the regulation of research involving \nhumans.1 The importance of systematic and consistent decision-making by RECs has been repeatedly \nemphasised. 2 3 However, most current evidence about the operation and functioning of RECs is \nanecdotal. It is often in the form of reports from frustrated researchers about single applications, 4  5  and \nsometimes derives from wounding encounters. Systematic evidence about the normal processes of how \nRECs operate is needed. 6 In this paper we report an analysis of letters written by RECs to researchers \nabout a range of different types of application as part of a controlled study.  \n \nLetters to researchers in response to applications state the reasons that RECs give to support the \ndecisions they make, and are a key source of information about what RECs see as decisive and \npersuasive in their decision processes.  Although RECs may reach decisions \u201cbackstage\u201d 7  on a wide \nvariety of grounds, in letters in the UK they are formally required to give reasons in line with published \nguidance, known as GAfREC (Governance Arrangements for Research Ethics Committees). We aimed to \nidentify what kinds of issues are raised as ethical troubles by RECs in letters to researchers, and to \nassess how far the kinds of ethical issues raised and remedies proposed were similar between different \ncommittees in response to the same applications. \n \nMethods \n \nData sources \nThe three RECs in one Strategic Health Authority in the UK participated in our project, which ran between \nFebruary 2004 and February 2005. The members of the three RECs in the project agreed to review an \nadditional application at each of the meetings during the period of the study. All applications used in our \nstudy were selected from those routinely submitted to the RECs, and were therefore \u201cgenuine\u201d and not \nconstructed for purposes of the project. For each application in the project, each of the three RECs gave \nfull consideration to the application and wrote a decision letter as part of the routine work of the \ncommittee. However, each application was assigned (by EA, who was a REC administrator at the time of \nthe study) a \u201clead\u201d committee in advance of the meetings where the application was to be considered; the \ndecision letter to the applicants was issued from the lead committee only, so that applicants received only \none decision letter. Committee members received all applications for each meeting as a package, and \n 4 \nwere not told which application was a \u201cstudy\u201d application, nor were they told whether they were the \u201clead\u201d \ncommittee for any particular application.  \n \nPurposive sampling was used to select different types of applications, including different study types. Each \nof the 18 applications in our project (seven qualitative, six non-intervention, and five intervention) was \nreviewed independently by all three RECs. Each REC reviewed six applications as the \u201clead\u201d and a further \n12 applications as a non-lead.   \n \nThe Central Office for Research Ethics Committees confirmed that the project constituted service \nevaluation and need not be reviewed by a Research Ethics Committee. Members of the RECs in the \nproject gave verbal consent to participation in Autumn 2003.  Researchers whose applications were \nincluded were contacted following the decision letter from the lead REC. They were given an explanation \nof the project, advised that the letters were anonymised for purposes of analysis, and given the \nopportunity to decline use of quotations from letters about their application in reports of the project. One \napplicant declined. \n \nAnalysis \nAs reported elsewhere,8 the RECs\u2019 decisions about the outcomes of the applications were consistent \nbetween RECs for eleven applications and showed disagreement for seven. In this paper we report the \nkinds of issues raised by the RECs about the applications. Two forms of analysis were undertaken. First, \ncontent analysis, a systematic method for assigning text to content categories, 9 was used. This allows a \nconsistent and transparent examination of categories that can be expressed in terms of frequencies. We \nused seven categories based on official guidance given to RECs in the UK (GAfREC).1  An eighth \n\u201coutside-GAfREC\u201d category was added to classify issues that appeared to be outside the remit of \nGAfREC.   \n \nA second distinct and more detailed analysis of issues was enabled through development of a coding \nscheme based on the principles of ethnographic content analysis (ECA). 10 11  Defined as the \u201creflexive \nanalysis of documents\u201d, it is this reflexive feature of ECA that makes the approach \u201cethnographic\u201d.10 ECA \ninvolves constant and recursive movement between data collection, data analysis through interpretation, \nand concept development, to generate analytic constructs.  Our ECA scheme was produced by all authors \n 5 \nthrough close inspection and comparison across the texts of the letters. Explicit specifications for major \norganising categories and for sub-categories were devised. Coding using both the GAfREC and the ECA \nschemes was undertaken by EA and CJJ, facilitated by use of QSR N6 software, and was independently \nchecked by MDW. Some quotations used to illustrate the analysis have had identifying details removed or \nmodified to preserve anonymity.  \n \nThe frequency with which RECs raised issues under the eight GAfREC categories varied across \napplications and across categories (Table 1). The ECA analysis identified further variability in the nature of \nthe ethical issues that were raised and in the remedies suggested. Where helpful, we therefore report the \nfrequency of issues identified in letters in relation to the number of applications where the issue was \nraised.  \n \nResults \nInformed consent \nIssues relating to informed consent formed the ethical concern most often raised (51 of 54 letters relating \nto all 18 applications). \u201cInformed consent\u201d was raised by REC1 in 17 letters, REC2 in 18 letters and REC3 \nin 16 letters. The frequency with which RECs raised specific sub-categories of issues under this broad \ncategory varied (Table 2), as did the number of committees raising a given subcategory of this issue for \nthe same application (Table 3).  Even where two or more RECs identified the same category of issue, they \ndid not always cite the same specific instance of that issue.  In application 4 (a drug trial), for example, \n\u201cinformed consent\u201d was raised by all three RECs, but in relation to different types of concern. For this \napplication, only REC1 identified that participants should be informed that participating in the research \nmight involve additional surgical procedures, only REC2 identified that clarity was needed over whether \nparticipants could take oral contraceptives, and only REC3 identified that participants should be advised \nthat although the study drug was licensed, it was being used in unlicensed form in the trial. \n \nSixteen letters about 10 applications raised concerns about whether the patient information leaflets (PILs) \nwere sufficiently easy to read and understand \u2013 though the same concerns were not raised in the other 14 \nletters about the these same applications. Five letters (of a total of 12 regarding four applications) \nidentified problems of layout, grammar, and font size. \n 6 \n \nPlease re-write in language understandable to a lay person (application 3, REC2). \n \nConcerns that full disclosure be made to potential participants were prominent. The risk of potential \nparticipants being misled about various aspects of the research was identified in 13 letters, though not in \nthe other 14 letters about the same nine applications.  \n \nThe PIL is non-standard and constitutes more of a letter of invitation rather than providing the participants \nwith detailed information about the project.  It was also felt to be somewhat promotional of the product \nrather than providing a balanced view (application 9, REC2). \n \nTen letters raised the issue of proceeding without obtaining consent (either generally or in particular \ncircumstances), though the other five letters about the same applications did not. Five of these letters \neither rejected or questioned plans not to obtain consent.  \n \nScientific design and conduct  \nConcerns related to scientific design and conduct were raised in 42 letters relating to all 18 applications, \nthough 12 letters did not raise concerns. The concerns were raised in 13 letters from REC1, 15 letters \nfrom REC2 and 14 letters from REC3. The frequency with which committees raised specific matters \nrelating to scientific design and conduct varied.  For instance, issues relating to \u201cchoice of methods\u201d were \nraised in four letters by REC1, eight letters by REC2 and five letters by REC3.  The number of committees \nraising a given issue varied for the same applications. For example, although \u201cchoice of methods\u201d was \nraised in 17 letters in relation to 11 applications, it was raised by all three RECs unanimously for only two \napplications. Even when RECs identified the same issue, the particular questions they raised about this \nissue often varied. For example, for application 12, one REC expressed confusion about the purpose of \nthe proposed focus group; a second queried whether interviews might elicit better quality data; the third \nrequested further information. \n \nSampling issues were raised in 21 letters though not in the 15 other letters about the same 12 \napplications. Concerns about the size of the sample were raised in seven of the 18 letters about six \napplications. The most common sampling \u201ctrouble\u201d related to inclusion and exclusion criteria. This was \n 7 \nraised in 16 letters, but not in the 17 other letters about the same 11 applications.  Fifteen letters \nhighlighted issues concerning quantitative analysis, including appropriateness of proposed statistical \nanalysis, though not the other 15 letters relating to the same 10 applications.  \n \nThe committee asks if your aims are too ambitious?  You plan to examine 27 variables to 0.05 statistical \nsignificance in just 30 people (application 1, REC2). \n \nLetters identified concerns about the feasibility of the studies proposed. Such concerns included the \nlikelihood of meeting the objectives using the proposed design or within the specified timescales. Six \nletters raised queries related to the use or content of questionnaires, including lack of validation, though \nthese issues were not raised in the other nine letters about the same five applications.    \n \nOne of the child PILs states that other children will be doing the questionnaire, yet A10 states that the \nquestionnaire is validated in adults only (application 11, REC2). \n \nCare and protection of research participants \nThe third most common set of concerns, raised in 37 letters relating to 13 applications, were about \u201ccare \nand protection of research participants\u201d. These were raised in 13 letters by REC1, 11 letters by REC2 and \n13 letters by REC3, but the frequency with which they raised specific issues varied. For instance, the risk \nof those involved in research being prevailed upon to do things they might prefer not to do was raised in \neight letters by REC1, two letters by REC2, and five letters by REC3. The number of committees raising a \ngiven issue varied for the same application. For instance, although the risk of people being \u201cprevailed \nupon\u201d was raised in 15 letters in relation to 10 applications, there was only one application for which all \nthree RECs raised this issue unanimously. When RECs did raise an issue, they did not always raise it in \nthe same way. This is illustrated in application 16, where two RECs were concerned about travel \nexpenses and the other was concerned that participants might be taking part in another trial. Only one \nREC raised an issue related to \u201cthreat of physical harm\u201d, and only one REC raised an issue related to \n\u201cvulnerable groups\u201d in relation to this application. \n \n 8 \nVarious types of risk were identified in letters. Emotional risks such as anxiety, distress, and \nembarrassment were highlighted in 22 letters relating to 13 applications, though not the 17 other letters \nabout the same applications.   \nPlease make it clear what mechanisms are in place should distress be caused by the interview \n(application 5, REC2). \n \nFifteen letters relating to 10 applications referred to the possibility of participants being asked to take on \npotentially unreasonable burdens such as travel expenses or having additional procedures.  However, 15 \nletters about the same 10 applications did not raise these concerns.   \n  \nReimbursement for repeated visits to the hospital is not unreasonable for additional visits for the 20 \npatients. The committee request that you make provision for reimbursement for extra visits (application 16, \nREC2). \n \nThe risk of physical harm to participants was identified in 10 letters about five applications. Such risks \nincluded harms that might result from drugs, alternative\/additional procedures, and from interventions \nincluding denial or delay of treatment during \u201cwash-out\u201d periods. However, five letters about the same \napplications did not raise these concerns. \n \nPlease clarify the rates of adverse events with these higher doses of [named drug]. In addition, the \ncommittee asks why you will be using this higher dose? (application 4, REC1). \n \nRECs identified particular groups of people as being especially deserving of protection, including people \nwith mental health problems, people unable to read English, healthcare professionals, children, women, \nmembers of ethnic minority groups, people with learning disabilities, and terminally ill people. \n \nProtection of research participants\u2019 confidentiality \nConfidentiality was raised in 34 letters relating to 14 applications, though not in the other eight letters \nabout the same applications. REC1, REC2 and REC3 raised issues related to confidentiality in 14, 9 and \n11 letters respectively.  The frequency with which they raised specific issues varied. For instance, issues \nrelating to storage of data were raised in six letters by REC1, but in only three letters from REC2 and \n 9 \nREC3 respectively. Although storage of data is identified as an ethical trouble in 12 letters relating to eight \napplications, it was only once identified by all three committees in relation to the same application. The \nspecific issues raised also varied. For example, for application 1, one REC suggested not using a consent \nform in order to protect confidentiality; a second suggested two options (either telling participants that their \ndata would be accessible to some staff, or not asking for participants\u2019 names at all); and the third that \nparticipants be informed that data would be accessible to the investigator and the supervisor. \n \nFor four applications, six letters identified the need to inform potential participants of the need to break \nconfidentiality under certain circumstances, such as child protection. The remaining six letters about these \napplications did not identify this need. Concerns about how far anonymity could be assured were raised in \n16 letters (of a total of 24) relating to eight applications.  \n \nIn light of the small numbers, the committee was concerned about the anonymity of the comments made \nby participants [\u2026] it was felt that certain comments may be easily attributable to individuals  (application \n10, REC1). \n \nRecruitment of research participants \nTwenty-six letters relating to 16 applications raised issues relating to the recruitment of research \nparticipants, though this means that these issues were not raised in the 22 other letters about the same \napplications. REC1 raised these issues in eight letters, REC2 in eight, and REC3 in 10. The frequency \nwith which they raised specific issues varied. For instance, the possibility of coercion was raised in eight \nletters from REC1 and REC2 respectively, and in 10 letters from REC3. The number of committees raising \na given issue varied for the same application. For 15 applications, the possibility of coercion was raised in \n26 letters but it was not raised in the 19 other letters about the same applications. There were only two \napplications where all three RECs were consistent in raising the issue of coercion.  Even when the same \nissue was raised, it was often done in a different way. For example, for application 9, REC1 was \nconcerned with honesty about the nature of the research whereas REC2 was troubled that the information \nwas biased in favour of the product; REC3 did not express concerns about this issue. \n \nThis project constitutes commercial validation of a new device.  Please be upfront about this both in the \napplication and on the PIL.  (REC1) \n 10 \nThe most common concerns in this area referred to the means by which initial contact and recruitment \nwould be conducted.  \n \nIt is noted that the [intervention] group are consented by an opt-in procedure.  However, although the \ncontrol group have been informed of details of the trial up to two weeks before [\u2026], details have not been \nprovided to ensure that there is no element of pressure to conform  (application 16, REC3). \n \nHow the participants were to be recruited and who was to obtain their consent was raised by nine letters  \nabout seven applications though not by 12 other letters about the same applications.    \n \nThe Committee felt that a client who does not wish to take part in the study is placed in an invidious \nsituation because of their relationship with the case manager, and may find it difficult to opt out \n(application 1, REC3). \n \nCommunity considerations \n\u201cCommunity considerations\u201d were raised in only two letters; one where researchers were advised to be \ncareful in their reporting (because of anonymity considerations) and another where a REC suggested that \nthe study offered an opportunity for personal development for staff. \n \nOther issues \nTwenty-four letters relating to 13 applications raised issues that could not be coded to any of the GAfREC \ncategories. The potential for the research to affect negatively people other than the research participants \nwas noted in 13 letters, though not in the 17 other letters about the same 10 applications. Risks to other \nhealthcare professionals were identified in some letters, as were concerns about staff acquiring additional \nburdens.  \n \n the [\u2026] team [\u2026] will be taking on an additional body of work, and even though they have consented to \ntake part it is still an additional risk and inconvenience (application 7, REC3). \n \n 11 \nThe possibility of the research affecting other patients, unborn children, or others not directly involved in \nthe research were also mentioned. Risks to researchers, including the possibility of harassment, were \nidentified in four letters relating to three applications.  \n \nIssues relating to problems with documentation were raised in 18 letters relating to 10 applications, \nincluding errors such as missing documentation, conflicting information between different documents, or \nevidently \u2018wrong\u2019 information. However, these issues were not raised in the other 12 letters about the \nsame applications. \n \nAlthough Question A40 states that computers will be used, this is not confirmed in Question 39.  Please \nrevise the form as necessary (application 4, REC3). \n  \nRemedies to ethical troubles  \nOur analysis identified 83 instances where committees proposed \u201cremedies\u201d to ethical trouble in the 54 \nletters in the sample (Table 4). No application escaped without a request for an amendment, but the RECs \nvaried in the frequency with which they requested different types of amendment between applications and \nbetween RECs. For example, amendments to the patient information leaflet (PIL) were requested in \nrelation to all but one application. However, there were only six applications where all three RECs \nrequested such amendments; for the remainder, remedies to the PIL were suggested by one or two \ncommittees only. Even where two or more committees identified the same category of issue, they did not \nalways recommend the same remedy. For example, in relation to application 8 (concerning a comparison \nof two surgical techniques), issues relating to informed consent were identified by two committees, but the \nproposals for the resolution of these varied.  REC1 made six recommendations for amendment of the PIL, \nincluding advising participants of the likelihood that one treatment might be better than the other, and \nexplaining the likely differences in benefit. REC2 made two recommendations for amendment of the PIL, \nand suggested that participants should be advised that the risks of each procedure were low, but that the \nstudy would allow them to be compared. REC3 raised no issues relating to the PIL. \n \n \n \n \n 12 \nDiscussion \nThis project has identified the ethical troubles raised by RECs during the course of their normal work over \na year in response to applications from researchers for ethical approval for various study types. Though a \nnecessarily small sample given the difficulties of conducting systematic comparisons in this area, this \nanalysis suggests that issues relating to informed consent were the most common type of ethical trouble \nidentified by RECs, followed by scientific design and conduct, care and protection of research participants, \nconfidentiality, recruitment, and community considerations. There is evidence of variability in the ethical \ntroubles identified by RECs as well as in the ethical remedies recommended to researchers. These \nfindings raise important questions about the role and functioning of RECs in the ethical conduct of \nresearch. \n \nFirst, this analysis suggests that RECs institutionalise some ethical principles as fundamental to sound \nresearch practice. The prominence of informed consent as an ethical concern may in part be traced to the \ninstitutionalisation of consent as an ethical orthodoxy within bioethical and policy discourses.12 Importantly, \nhowever, the regulatory role of consent as an \u201cauditable moment\u201d with its own documentation and visibility \nto judicial scrutiny 13 is likely to explain some of this focus. On the other hand, some issues \u2013 such as \n\u201ccommunity considerations\u201d were identified as ethical troubles only rarely, possibly reflecting an orientation \nthat prioritises individual safety and choice over public welfare, or that it is easier to think in terms of \neffects on individuals than on a more vaguely conceptualised \u201ccommunity\u201d. Also noteworthy is the \nfrequency with which issues of scientific design and study quality were raised. Though this is one of the \ncategories of GAfREC  for which RECs have a remit, the role of RECs in relation to issues of scientific \ndesign and quality is increasingly contentious, with the recent Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Research Ethics \nCommittees arguing that RECs should focus on substantive ethical issues rather than scientific ones. 14 \nClearly, there are tensions between various policy stances on this question, but our finding that scientific \nissues are prominent in RECs\u2019 considerations  may reflect the ways in which the territory of ethical \nconcern appears to have expanded, 12  or that distinctions between what is \u201cethical\u201d and what is \u201cscientific\u201d \nmay be seen as unstable by RECs.   \n \nSecond, this analysis offers systematic confirmation of previous suggestions of variability in the types of \nethical troubles identified by RECs, the nature of those troubles and their remedies.  Such inconsistencies \nhave traditionally been treated primarily as evidence of the incompetent, vexatious, or capricious nature of \n 13 \nthe process, 15 16 but our data raise important questions both about how far consistency is achievable or \ndesirable, and about the role of moral authorities in the governance and regulation of research practice. \n \nOne way of characterising inconsistency between RECs is to deem it evidence of poor performance. \nHowever, any approach to improving consistency that relies on guidelines, increased training or sharing of \ninformation \u2013 in effect, a more \u201cmanaged\u201d process - faces many challenges. Evidence in other areas \ndemonstrates the often modest impact of such strategies in effecting change.17 This is likely to be even \nmore limited in group-based situations such as RECs, where customs, traditions, styles of working, group \ndynamics and cumulative and collective knowledge experiences are all likely to influence debates, \nprocess and outcome. 18 Variability in the expertise brought to committees by members is also likely to \naffect the decisions of RECs; for example, a REC that includes a specialist in neurology might reach an \nopinion about an application for a trial of an intervention for chronic pain that differs from one that includes \na psychologist. Such differences may occur not simply because of differing clinical expertise, but also \nbecause of differing scientific knowledge and potentially different views of the moral issues in such \nresearch.  Furthermore, removing flexibility in the application of rules could result in forms of \nbureaucratisation where formalistic aspects of decision-making are valued over substantive ones.19  \n \nBeyond the arguments from organisational theory about the functionality and dysfunctionalities associated \nwith imposing more managed, rule-based systems, a more fundamental challenge to consistency \nconcerns the nature of the work that RECs must do: make judgements about moral matters.20 Guidelines \nin this area are unlikely to function as algorithmic processes, but more as frames of reference. They might \nprovide useful direction and help to reduce inconsistencies between committees that are due to \ncarelessness or inattentiveness to aspects of applications. However, variability in moral judgements is \ninevitable because it is not simply a matter of reading the moral rules and applying them to applications; \ndiscretion is involved when different types of concerns must be weighed up. In the absence of a final \nmoral authority in determining the reasonableness or otherwise of RECs\u2019 decisions, it is likely to be \nimpossible to specify what should have been the \u201ccorrect\u201d response to any particular application.  \n \nIf there is no single \u201cright\u201d answer to ethical issues in health-related research, can the role of the REC be \ndefended? One important argument is that relying on researchers to have been well trained in ethical \npractice and to have good consciences, and thus leaving them to self-regulate, exposes the entire \n 14 \nresearch community, as well as research participants, to risk. The institution and process of RECs thus \nserve key functions: discouraging unethical research (including that which never reaches committees), \nproviding a public warrant of ethical probity for researchers, and enhancing sensitivity to ethical issues in \nresearch. Researchers may therefore need to accept some inconsistency in decision-making in return for \nthese benefits, in the same way as they accept that the decisions of other gatekeepers of research and its \noutputs \u2013 those of funders and editors, for example \u2013 may also appear inconsistent and provocative.  \n \nThis is not to say that RECs may do and say as they please; their judgements should function with a \nnotion of there being an answer that all reasonable people could accept, and RECs have responsibilities \nto pursue this in good faith. Although the exercise of judgement may be inherently fallible, it is not merely \narbitrary power and caprice; in this respect it is analogous to judicial decision-making.  RECs need to be \nreflexive 21 and responsible in their decision-making, and satisfactory and effective appeal mechanisms \nare clearly necessary. But researchers may also need to accept that inconsistency is not necessarily the \nsame as irrationality or illogicality.    \n \n 15 \n \nFunding \nEast Midlands NHS Innovation Hub funded the analysis (but had no involvement in the decision to submit \nthis paper). COREC gave permission for coordination of the project to be undertaken during working \nhours. Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland Strategic Health Authority allowed EA two days for \nwriting up.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to the members of the three RECs who participated in the study and to the applicants whose \napplications were used in the project. The idea for this project was conceived following discussions \nbetween EA and two REC members (Dr Douglas Tincello and Dr Carl Edwards), and the data collection \nstrategy was designed by EA and Dr Ron Hsu.  \n \nEthics approval \nSupport was sought and obtained from COREC in summer 2003. COREC confirmed that the project \nconstituted service evaluation and therefore need not be reviewed by a Research Ethics Committee. \n \nCompeting interests \nRA is a member GTAC is the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, which is recognized for Clinical Trial \nRegulations purposes as the REC for gene therapy. EA was the administrator of RECs in the strategic \nhealth authority where the project was conducted during the period of the project. EA, RA, and MDW \ncurrently hold a grant from COREC to conduct a separate analysis of RECs\u2019 letters, but do not believe this \nconstitutes a conflict of interest.  \n \nContributorship \nEA conceived the idea for the study and coordinated the running of the project. All authors were involved \nin devising the ECA coding scheme. EA and CJJ undertook coding of the data. All authors were involved \nin interpreting the data and identifying relevant literature. MDW obtained funding for the analysis and led \non writing of the paper.
