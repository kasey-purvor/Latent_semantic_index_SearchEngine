For example,\nAg nanoparticles are of particular interest due to their\nsurface-enhanced Raman effect,3 which can increase the sen-\nsitivity of Raman measurements by orders of magnitude,\neven allowing single molecule detection. However, the mag-\nnitude of the enhancement is strongly affected by the precise\nnanostructure; thus, research is on going to produce reliable,\nrepeatable nanostructured surfaces.4,5 Typically, nanostruc-\ntured silver substrates for performing surface-enhanced\nRaman spectroscopy \u0001SERS\u0002 are prepared by chemical\nmeans from citrate reduced Ag colloids.6 However, pattern-\ning silver only onto selected areas of a substrate, an impor-\ntant capability for using SERS in future lab-on-chip tech-\nnologies or for facile integration into industrial processes, is\nchallenging using this method. The laser direct writing of\nmaterials has been studied extensively, often using the matrix\nassisted pulsed laser evaporation transfer technique7 or by\ndirectly machining microstructures.8 However, reports of the\nlaser writing of nanoparticles are rare9 and typically involve\nthe precoating of the substrate with a layer of a material to\nallow photocatalysis to occur at an interface.10\nIn this letter we introduce a method for directly writing\nAg nanoparticles using a pulsed laser, from a solution con-\ntaining larger Ag particles onto low-cost glass substrates at\nlow macroscopic temperatures. This process is rapid, re-\nquires no pretreatment of the substrate, and involves no com-\nplex chemistry. Once produced, the effectiveness of these\narrays as substrates for performing SERS is investigated.\nThe initial silver nanoparticle solutions were synthesized\nby a UV photoreduction technique using the pulses from a\nLambda-Physik LPX 210i excimer laser operating at\n248 nm, with a pulse duration of 25 ns. 4 ml of a 0.01M\nAgNO3 solution was placed in an open fused silica vessel,\nwith a rectangular cross section, mounted on an X-Y transla-\ntion stage. 90 mJ laser pulses were focused to produce a\nrectangular spot of area 0.4 cm2 and fluence of 225 mJ\/cm2.\nThe laser spot was raster scanned over the whole area of the\nvessel once every 15 s. A laser shot repetition rate of 20 Hz\nwas used throughout the experiments.\nDuring the initial UV photoreduction of the AgNO3 so-\nlution, a progressive color change was observed. Initially, the\nsolution was clear and colorless. After around 5 min of irra-\ndiation a yellow-brown coloration was observed. This col-\noration is attributed to surface plasmon resonance \u0001SPR\u0002 ab-\nsorption of silver nanoparticles.11,12 After 6 min, the solution\nappeared gray-brown and became more opaque to the eye,\nlikely due to scattering from larger particulates. After\n10 min, the solution was gray and cloudy in appearance,\napart from the area currently exposed to the laser beam,\nwhere a transient yellow-brown coloration was observed.\nThis transient coloration quickly vanished as the laser beam\npassed. Figure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows a scanning electron microscope\n\u0001SEM\u0002 image of the material collected from the solution onto\na silicon substrate after the 10 min irradiation. Particulates\nwith sizes in the range 50\u2013500 nm were observed. These\nparticulates were confirmed to be metallic silver by energy\ndispersive x-ray analysis and electron diffraction measure-\nments in the transmission electron microscope \u0001results not\nshown here.\u0002\nHaving demonstrated that the UV photoreduction of the\nAgNO3 solution produces silver particles in solution, these\nparticles were used as a source of silver for laser writing onto\nglass substrates. The photoreduction was repeated, but after a\nset time into the process \u0001varied between 0 and 10 min\u0002 pre-\ncleaned glass substrates \u0001standard borosilicate microscope\ncover glasses\u0002 were placed into the vessel and the irradiation\nwas continued for an additional 5 min, scanning over half of\nthe surface of each substrate, through the solution. It should\nbe noted that sedimentation of the source silver particulates\nwas observed to occur around 6 h after synthesis, so during\nthe treatment process little sedimentation of the particulates\nis expected. After the laser treatment, the samples were re-\nmoved from the solution and washed in deionized waster.\nThe surface morphology of each sample was then examined\nin an environmental scanning electron microscope \u0001E-SEM\u0002\n\u0001FEI Quanta 200F\u0002, operating in low-vacuum mode to avoid\ncharging of the insulating substrates. For the samples in-\nserted into the solution between 0 and 5 min of irradiation\n\u0001i.e., before any visible color change\u0002, significant crackinga\u0002Electronic mail: s.henley@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 91, 023107 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/91\u00022\u0001\/023107\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics91, 023107-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Visually, the\nglass appeared opaque with a slight brown tinge. For the\nsamples placed into the solution after 8 min or more, the\nsurface took on a strong yellow color only at the laser-\nirradiated areas. Figure 1\u0001b\u0002 shows an E-SEM image of the\nlaser-irradiated area of a glass substrate inserted into the so-\nlution after 10 min of photoreduction. The glass surface has\nbecome much rougher than the untreated areas, with evi-\ndence that melting has occurred. The irradiated areas are also\ndecorated with small silver nanoparticles, which appear as\nbright dots in the image. No such features were observed in\nthe untreated regions of the glass. Having demonstrated that\nit is possible to selectively decorate a sample, a predefined\npattern can now be written onto to a glass substrate by irra-\ndiating through a mask or by restricting the laser spot and\ntranslating the X-Y stage. Figure 1\u0001c\u0002 shows the initials of the\nAdvanced Technology Institute \u0001ATI\u0002 written in silver nano-\nparticles onto a glass substrate.\nAfter examining the surface morphology, the optical ab-\nsorption spectrum of each sample was then measured using a\nCary 5000 UV-visible-near infrared spectrometer. A constant\nbackground, obtained from an untreated glass sample, is re-\nmoved from each spectrum. Figure 2 shows optical absorp-\ntion spectra obtained from the laser treated areas of glass\nsubstrates inserted into AgNO3 solutions after \u0001a\u0002 0 min, \u0001b\u0002\n3 min, \u0001c\u0002 8 min, and \u0001d\u0002 10 min of photo-reduction. Sup-\nporting the observations from the SEM, the samples intro-\nduced after 0 and 3 min show significant absorption across\nthe spectrum, which we attribute to scattering due to the\nsignificant surface damage and a high density of cracks.\nThere is some evidence from spectra \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002 of a weak\nsilver SPR peak located at \u0005430 nm. For the samples intro-\nduced later into the process \u0003spectra \u0001c\u0002 and \u0001d\u0002\u0004, a strong\nsilver SPR peak is easily observed at 439 nm for both\nsamples. The long-wavelength scattering from these samples\nis similar to that of the untreated glass, showing that there is\nlittle large scale modification to the glass surface.\nHaving demonstrated that selective deposition is pos-\nsible, the mechanisms behind the decoration should be dis-\ncussed. Firstly, although a constant laser pulse energy was\nused in each run, the duration of the photoreduction prior to\ninserting of the substrates affects the fluence on the glass.\nThis is due to the increasing absorption of the laser energy\nby silver particulates in the solution. The modification of\nnoble metal nanoparticles by laser irradiation has been stud-\nied in detail previously.13,14 For short pulse irradiation, nano-\nparticles that are larger than a threshold size can be heated by\nthe laser irradiation to temperatures high enough to cause\nfragmentation and boiling, producing a distribution of hot,\nsmaller clusters. Particles that are smaller than this threshold\ncool rapidly due to their high surface area to volume ratio,\nand are hence relatively unaffected by the irradiation. It is\nsuggested that the large particles and aggregates observed in\nsolution after the photoreduction \u0003see Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 absorb a\nfraction of the incident laser energy and fragment into\nsmaller particles. This hypothesis is supported by the obser-\nvation of the transient yellow-brown coloration during con-\ntinued irradiation of the solutions formed after 10 min of\nphotoreduction. This transient coloration quickly vanished as\nthe laser beam passed, which is likely due to the small clus-\nters coalescing into large particles. However, in the vicinity\nof the glass substrate these smaller nanoparticles can be sta-\nbilized if they stick to the surface. The observed melting of\nthe glass surface \u0003see Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004, by the remaining fraction of\nthe energy that does not get absorbed by the solution, is\nthought to increase the likelihood of these nanoparticles\nsticking, as they can become embedded into the molten sur-\nface. SEM images of the regions close to the irradiated areas\nshowed the presence of very few nanoparticles, again indi-\ncating that melting of the glass surface is important in assist-\ning the attachment of the silver. The yellow coloration ob-\nserved in the laser treated areas was unaffected by washing\nthe substrates, indicating that the coatings are robust.\nAs nanoparticles with a strong SPR can be produced, by\nintroducing the glass into the process after around 10 min,\nthe suitability of these substrates for SERS was investigated\nusing a Renishaw Ramanscope, using 514 nm excitation. A\ndilute solution of Rhodamine 6G \u0001R6G, \u000520 \u0001M\u0002 was used\nas a standard test analyte. The substrates were placed into the\nanalyte solution for 10 min and then removed and blown dry\nwith nitrogen to remove any excess. Figure 3 shows Raman\nscattering spectra taken from silver decorated glass \u0003spec-\ntrum \u0001a\u0002\u0004 and untreated glass \u0003spectrum \u0001b\u0002\u0004. The character-\nistic Raman peaks from R6G could easily be detected in the\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 SEM image of the silver particles present in the\nsolution after 10 min of photoreduction. \u0001b\u0002 E-SEM image of the laser-\nirradiated area of a glass substrate exposed to a fluence of 225 mJ\/cm2.

This is attributed to a combination of\nsurface-enhanced fluorescence15 and the increased surface\narea of the glass due to the nanoscale roughening introduced\nby irradiation.\nIn conclusion, a solution based laser direct write tech-\nnique for precisely decorating selected areas of glass sub-\nstrates with silver nanoparticles is presented. The laser-\ninduced fragmentation of silver particles in a source solution\ninto which the substrate is inserted, assisted by the melting of\nthe glass surface, produces robust coatings of silver nanopar-\nticles only at the laser-irradiated regions. This technique pro-\nduces SERS active coatings of silver particles, with a strong\nenhancement of the Raman signal demonstrated, and is\nreadily scalable to pattern large areas. The technique also\ninduces nanoscale roughening of the glass surface, enhanc-\ning its effective surface area for collecting analytes.\nThe authors are grateful to the EPSRC Portfolio Grant\nfor funding.\n1W.
