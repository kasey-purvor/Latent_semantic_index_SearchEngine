Whilst acknowledging the \nneed to evidence effectiveness in order to satisfy policy-makers, victims, and the wider \npublic, we explore the constraints of quantifying the impact of these activities. \n \nKey Words \nprison, intervention, creativity, artistic and spiritual activities \nThis paper examines the role of artistic and spiritual activities with prisoners.  In \nparticular, it is concerned with the way in which calls for evidence-based policy and \npractice may undermine diverse and responsive work that occurs beyond the realm of \naccredited offending behaviour programmes.  For a number of years, activities \nfacilitated by the arts sector have been successfully taking place with prisoners; \nhowever, limited empirical evidence exists in relation to their outcomes.  This may \n2 \n \npartly be due to the ideological conflict between the arts and sciences but, equally, as \na result of government funding prioritising interventions of a psychological nature.  \nBut, as a result of increasing acknowledgement of the role that voluntary and \ncharitable organisations play in the criminal justice sector, it is possible to see an \nemerging recognition of the need to evaluate this work.  This paper initially sets out \nthe links between spirituality, creativity and affect before moving on to consider the \nway in which affect is integral to the commission of, and response to, crime.  A review \nof government policy which focuses on partnership approaches with the voluntary and \ncharitable sector is then explored, which is particularly pertinent for artistic and \nspiritual practitioners as they predominantly originate from this region.  The latter \nsection of the paper highlights the merits of these approaches for prisoners, drawing \non some of the limited research currently available in this area, before concluding with \nsome reflections on both the ideological and methodological difficulties of seeking to \nevaluate artistic and spiritual activities.  We finish by challenging both researchers and \npolicy-makers to consider a more democratic and empowering approach to evaluation \nwhich will require the courage to move beyond what may be politically acceptable. \nDuring the early spring of 2009 a paper sculpture entitled \u2018Bringing Music to Life\u2019 \nwas put on display in the South Bank Centre.  The piece used the cut and folded sheet \nmusic of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony to represent an orchestra and choir, and was \nconsidered to be an exquisite piece of art - until the identity of artist was revealed.  \nThe Royal Festival Hall had bought the piece of work from the Koestler Trust which had \nbeen made by the double rapist and child murderer, Colin Pitchfork, whose legal team \nwere in the process of questioning his sentence length (Purves, 2009).  To the Koestler \nTrust the offence committed by the artist is not of concern; it is the artistic value (both \n3 \n \nintrinsic and extrinsic) of the work which is significant.  To some readers of the \nGuardian, Times, Sun, Independent, Daily Mail and Leicester Mercury, the value of the \nartwork was inextricably linked to Pitchfork\u2019s offences.  The media furore over the \nsculpture raises questions as to why creative activities with prisoners are negatively \nregarded by some sections of the community.  If Mr Pitchfork had been celebrating \nachievement in an academic examination or an accredited programme, it is hard to \nenvisage that this emotionally heightened reaction would have ensued.  Pitchfork\u2019s \ncreative act can be viewed as the manifestation of his being; something of which his \nvictims\u2019 families did not want to be reminded.  Perhaps it is because the creative act \nembodies the living, breathing essence of the Self, what Negus and Pickering (2004, p. \n2) call \u2018the external manifestation of divine creation\u2019 that this negative reaction arose. \nSpirituality, Creativity and Affect \nThe term \u2018creativity\u2019, with its origins in Judeao-Christian culture, still invokes concepts \nof religious practice, but it was not until the 18th Century that this word was linked to \nthe processes of \u2018doing art\u2019.  Even when the word was used to explain the role of \nartistic endeavour, it often had overtly religious or spiritual overtones.  The concept of \ncreativity changes over temporal and cultural space, much as crime and culture do, \nand in the modern era creativity is considered to be an indicator of, for example, \nindividuality, sub-cultural attachment or non-consumerism.  This leads to the \nsuggestion that some have replaced the quest for spiritual or religious meaning with \nartistic activity (Negus and Pickering 2004; Misra et al. 2006).  The link between \ncreativity and spirituality is the concept of affect; the feeling which is promoted by \nworshiping, creating or doing something risky.  Affect is something more than the \n4 \n \nemotional response to a particularly involving activity.  Massumi (2002, p. 214) further \nexplains that: \nIn affect, we are never alone.  That\u2019s because affects\u2026 are basically ways \nof connecting, to others and to other situations.  They are our angle of \nparticipation in processes larger than ourselves.  With intensified affect \ncomes a stronger sense of embeddedness in a larger field of life \u2013 a \nheightened sense of belonging, with other people and to other places \n(italics in original). \n \nHalsey and Young (2006) use the concept of affect to explore and explain the feelings \nof graffiti writers and ask us to consider the visceral nature of the physical and \nemotional impact of committing this form of \u2018crime\u2019.  They note the pride and feeling of \ncommunity spirit that is invoked through the process of creating a piece of artwork, \nand consider its importance in helping to explain the graffiti writers\u2019 behaviours.  This \nconceit is wonderfully illustrated by a scene in The Shawshank Redemption when \nDuFresne, after barricading himself in an office, plays a piece from The Marriage of \nFigaro over the prison speaker system.  The narration provide by Red highlights the \nbeauty and transformative effect of the music, ending with \u2018\u2026 every last man in \nShawshank felt free\u2019. \nIf affect, which is something more than simply an emotional response to \ncommitting an act of crime (Katz 1988; De Haan and Loader 2002; Karstedt 2002), is \nimportant in the commission of crime, might it play a role in the curtailment of \noffending?  The association of affect to social capital (Freiberg 2001) and from social \ncapital to theories of desistance (see, for example, Farrall 2004; Giordano et al. 2008) \nshould be an avenue for further exploration, but in the climate of punitive attitudes \ntowards offenders, combined with the demands for a primarily experimental evidence-\n5 \n \nbase for policy-making, the role of affect, and the artistic and spiritual activities which \nmay ignite it, is often ignored by policy-makers. \nSpiritual practices rarely feature in any criminal justice policy despite there being \ngrowing evidence of their ability to foster positive change.  Rucker (2005) notes that a \nnumber of men with convictions for violence found yoga and meditation brought them \n\u2018self-mastery\u2019.  In essence, they learned to control their emotions, feelings and temper.  \nThe empowering practice enabled the men to take control, but in a respectful and \npeaceful manner.  Winkelman (2003), who used shamanic drumming as part of a \nsubstance abuse rehabilitation programme, reports significant benefits on \n\u2018physiological, psychological and social\u2019 levels to aid the recovery process (p. 4).  \nDerezotes (2000) reveals that the adolescent sex offenders who did yoga particularly \nvalued the spiritual aspect of this activity.  In addition, the practice allowed them to \nconstructively channel their anger as a result of their increased levels of self-awareness \nand self-control.  In her review of the arts, (whilst acknowledging some methodological \nlimitations), Hughes (2005) found evidence of personal and social development.  \nRelationships between prisoners and staff were enhanced as a direct result of the \ninformal contact that these activities encouraged.  This, in turn, helped to maintain \ngood order, with a corresponding reduction in adjudications for problematic behaviour.  \nArtistic \/ spiritual activities can have a \u2018humanising\u2019 effect on prison culture (Wrench \nand Clarke 2004) and, because prison work is highly demanding and emotional \n(Crawley 2004), practices like yoga can help prison staff re-engage with their feelings \nand release stress (Prison Phoenix Trust 2009).  Recognising and working with emotion \nis highly significant in criminal justice, and public opinion concerning crime prevention \npolicies is heavily influenced by feelings (Freiberg 2001).  Denial of affect will only serve \n6 \n \nto reinforce the lack of emotional intelligence pervading modern society leading to \nincreased aggression, depression, social ineptitude and crime (Goleman 1996).  \nPrisoners need to undertake activities that not only address their offending behaviour, \nbut engage them holistically and enhance their emotional well-being.  Acknowledging \nthe role and impact of affect, therefore, must be at the heart of criminal justice policy, \npractice and research. \nGovernment Responses and Third Sector Involvement \nThe history of punishment, the treatment model, \u2018nothing works\u2019, \u2018What Works?\u2019, \npopular punitivism and the effects of new managerialism on the criminal justice \nsystem (CJS) are well-documented.  So, too, is the development of evidence-based, \ncognitive-behavioural interventions (CBT) which aim to reduce reoffending (see, for \nexample, Hollin and Bilby 2007).  These programmes may offer some success with \nsome prisoners in some circumstances (Falshaw et al. 2003), but the lack of \nunequivocal evidence of recidivism (Chitty, 2005) has led to calls for a re-focussing of \nMinistry of Justice policy.  Offending behaviour programmes should only \u2018continue to \nbe offered as part of the range of interventions for prisoners but fitted into a much \nwider rehabilitation agenda\u2019 (Home Affairs Select Committee 2004, p. 234).  \nAlternative practitioners have long understood that a \u2018one size fits all approach\u2019 does \nnot recognise and value prisoners\u2019 diversity, and proponents of the \u2018Good Lives Model\u2019 \nassert that risk \/ needs approaches, such as CBT, are essentially negative, focus on the \neradication of unacceptable behaviours rather than \u2018promoting pro-social and \npersonally more satisfying goals\u2019 (Ward and Brown 2004, p. 245).  A rigid reliance on \naccredited programmes may be misguided when evidence of effectiveness may \n7 \n \nsometimes be considered elusive (Johnston and Hewish 2008).  The goals of HM Prison \nService include the duty to look after prisoners with humanity, as well as rehabilitating \noffenders to lead crime-free lives on release from prison.  If we accept that an element \nof humanity is the need and desire to express ourselves in, sometimes, a non-verbal \nand creative manner, then we must also acknowledge that this interpretation \ndemands the provision of artistic and spiritual activities within the prison estate.  In \naddition, there is now an increasing indication that the government recognises the \nbenefits of an eclectic approach to work with offenders because of its focus on \npartnerships with the \u2018Third Sector\u2019 (Ministry of Justice 2008), the creation of the Arts \nAlliance in November 2008 (Anne Peaker Centre 2008) and through running \ninterventions that link CBT programmes with elements of drama-based approaches \n(Blacker et al. 2008). \nThe strengths of the Third Sector (defined by the Ministry of Justice as voluntary \nand community organisations, social enterprises, co-operatives and mutuals) lie in its \nability to be \u2018flexible, non-bureaucratic and responsive\u2019 and to \u2018offer holistic provision \nto deal with multiple needs and disadvantages\u2019 (Ministry of Justice 2008, p. 16).  The \nfact that the Third Sector is able to draw on local networks, including minority and \nfaith communities, is an added advantage in the work it undertakes and the social \ncapital it reinvests (Ministry of Justice 2008).  However, a number of Third Sector \norganisations feel nervous about the government\u2019s call to partnership (Silvestri 2009).  \nJohnston and Hewish (2008) argue that the spontaneous and emotional nature of their \nwork does not sit well with the \u2018What Works?\u2019 programme and Prison Service Order \n4350, which governs the accreditation of interventions.  The reconfiguration of \n8 \n \nactivities to meet accreditation requirements will, they fear, eradicate the very \nessence of what makes them successful:  sensitivity, adaptability and variety. \nIn the winter of 2008, a course facilitated by The Comedy School at HMP \nWhitemoor was cancelled by the Justice Secretary Jack Straw (The Guardian, 21 \nNovember 2008) after being successfully run for ten years (Dugan 2009).  Straw \nbelieved that a comedy course was not a justifiable use of taxpayers\u2019 money, despite \nthe fact that it seemed to address elements demanded by the decency agenda and had \nbeen running with a Third Sector organisation for a considerable amount of time.  On \nthe back of the press coverage of this story, Prison Service Instruction 50\/2008 was \nissued to help governors decide what constitutes acceptable activities in prisons; \u2018the \npublic acceptability test\u2019.  This guidance places victims and the public at the heart of \nthese decisions in that governors must \u2018avoid those which would generate indefensible \ncriticism and undermine public confidence in the Service\u2019 (NOMS 2009, p. 1).  How \nthey are to establish what the public thinks is not included.  \nGreater community engagement is at the heart of the government\u2019s agenda to \nrespond to victims and the wider public in matters of crime and disorder (Casey 2007) \nand, whilst this aim is laudable, provocative media campaigns that seek to elicit \nemotive and punitive responses, (illustrated by the Pitchfork and Comedy School cases \nand the inclusion of Part 7 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 on criminal memoirs), \noften prevent well-informed public debate on crime and disorder issues.  It is pertinent \nthat creativity is often regarded as resistance to the \u2018excessively bureaucratic and \nmanipulative\u2019 (Fisher 2002, p. 1) and that artistic and spiritual activities require space; \n9 \n \nspace to take risks and be impulsive (Ashmore 2008).  This is supported by Matarasso \n(1997, p. 59) who notes that: \nencouraging people to take risks may not seem to be the most useful \nimpact the arts could claim, but risk is fundamental to the human \ncondition, and learning to live with it is a prerequisite for growth and \ndevelopment \u2026  \n \nBut prisons are known for neither risk nor impulse and, whilst it is not suggested that \nthey could successfully operate without some level of discipline within a well-\norganised regime, the lack of space for prisoners to demonstrate any control and self-\ndirection is concerning.  If dependency is to be avoided, prisoners need to be \nempowered to take some degree of responsibility over their daily lives (Prior 2001).  \nIndeed, many accredited programmes aim to build such agency and self-efficacy \n(McGuire 2005; Clark 2000) but are often blighted with high attrition and a lack of \nenthusiastic participants (Kemshall and Canton 2002).  Alternative approaches of a \nspiritual and \/ or artistic nature can provide the necessary motivation to engage the \nmost disaffected prisoners and empower them to take part in other prison based \ninterventions and programmes (Hughes 2005; Digard et al. 2007; Cox and Gelsthorpe \n2008; Wilson et al. 2009).  Indeed, a document produced by the Department for \nEducation and Skills (2004, p. 30) clearly recognised the importance of the arts \ncurriculum in learning and skills provision for adult offenders.  Arts-based and \ninformed activities illustrate the importance of creativity in social movements, by \nallowing learners to improve their levels of self-esteem and enabling them to develop \na set of skills of import in both personal and professional lives.  These forms of \nactivities not only have an impact on their own, but we must also consider the \nimportance of sequencing artistic \/ spiritual interventions with, for example, CBT-\n10 \n \nbased programmes as well as the inclusion of creative elements in other forms of \nempirically evidenced interventions with offenders (Blacker et al. 2008). \nThe Value of Artistic and Spiritual Activities \nThe value of engaging prisoners in \u2018purposeful activity\u2019 has long been recognised and is \npart of Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons criteria against which prisons are \nassessed (HMIP 2008).  Prisoners should not only engage in education and training but \nalso have time and space to foster and develop positive relationships, enhancing the \n\u2018dynamic security\u2019 of the prison (HMIP 2007).  Therefore, artistic and spiritual activities \nshould constitute purposeful activity as they produce these type of benefits but, with \nthe current economic downturn and the Prison Service facing budget cuts of at least \n\u00a380 million per year (Times Online, February 9 2007), it is easy to see how creative \nactivities that are viewed as lacking practical utility may be the first to be cut.  The \nGovernment\u2019s Green Paper Reducing Re-Offending Through Skills and Employment \n(Department for Education and Skills 2005) made only the briefest acknowledgement \nof the arts in work with offenders and activities of a spiritual nature are conspicuously \nabsent; the main focus being on training for jobs such as \u2018welding, carpentry, metal \nwork or fork-lift driving\u2019 (p. 24).  Industries, it should be noted, that are currently facing \nincreasing levels of unemployment as a result of economic downturn (Fitzgibbon \n2009).  Yet, Robinson (2001, p. 41) reminds us that \u2018in 1998 the Government estimated \nthat the[se] creative industries had generated annual revenues of \u00a360 billion, a tenfold \nincrease in ten years\u2019.  It is concerning, therefore, that the Green Paper failed to \nconsider this sector as a serious contender for the future employment of prisoners. \n11 \n \nRecently, however, the government seems to have reassessed the role of \ncreativity and the arts in all aspects of education for children and adults.  At the Royal \nSociety of the Arts, the Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property, David \nLammy (2009) noted that not only did an understanding and practice of arts and \ncreativity enable us to understand the development of our society and culture, but it \ntaught people \u2018soft skills\u2019 which were valued by employers.  While the speech mainly \nfocussed on concepts of a liberal arts tertiary education, the point being made is still \nthe same; the arts are acclaimed, but only in relation to the economic benefit that they \nmight bring to the country.  Creativity, art and their associated skills are, in the current \nclimate, neither \u2018acceptable\u2019 nor \u2018purposeful\u2019 unless they can be commodified and are \nseen as having economic value.  Identifying the extrinsic value of artwork, and the skills \nneeded to create it is, at the very least, problematic and is, in itself, a defining feature \nof this form of endeavour.  But this leads us to further question the role of any activity \nwhich is not defined in terms of its ability to produce artefacts for consistent and \ncontinual consumption (Loader 2009) nor identifies the creators as legitimate or \nillegitimate consumers (McCulloch and McNeill 2007). The attribution of value only to \nactivities that generate consumables in this way fails, of course, to encompass spiritual \npractices whereby the inward development of Self is often hidden or difficult to \nverbalise.  Similarly, music projects in prison have also found that participants felt \u2018a \nsensation of peace and connection that they could not do justice to through verbal \ndescription\u2019 (Digard et al. 2007, p.5).  But, interestingly, there has been a recent \nchange of emphasis where subjective well-being is a key driver for economic policy-\nmaking. \n12 \n \nThe Government Office for Science (2008), in light of the UK\u2019s changing \neconomy, commissioned a project which sought to examine how to make best use of \nthe UK\u2019s material and mental resources.  The Foresight project sets out a number of \nkey challenges facing the UK due to the shifting demographics, global economy, \nscience and technology, and nature of society.  The report proposes that policy-makers \nharness and promote \u2018mental capital\u2019 in order to foster well-being in place of \ntraditional economic policies which emphasise monetary wealth.  This, more \nsustainable and holistic model of well-being has been promulgated by the new \neconomics foundation (Aked et al. 2008).  Within the findings, prisoners are \nacknowledged as one of the groups at high risk of poor mental health and, in order to \nincrease their \u2018mental capital\u2019, they need to build resilience.  Resilience being the \ndevelopment and sustention of protective factors which lead to \u2018positive adaptation in \nthe face of significant adversity or trauma\u2019 (Sutherland et al. 2005, p. 15) and help to \ndeter crime.  Aked et al. (2008, p. 1) note that well-being \u2018comprises two main \nelements:  feeling good and functioning well\u2019 and that \u2018*E+xperiencing positive \nrelationships, having some control over one\u2019s life and having a sense of purpose are all \nimportant attributes of well-being\u2019 (p. 2).  Artistic and spiritual practices can achieve \nthese aims (Hughes 2005; Rucker 2005), enabling prisoners to build resilience and an \narray of protective factors which can lessen the negative impact of imprisonment and \nreduce the risk of recidivism.  But this well-being cannot be created through the \nactions of dedicated practitioners alone. An environment conducive to creativity also \nhas to be cultivated, and the role of prison staff in cultivating this safe space has been \nidentified as an important component for personal growth and transformation to \noccur (Digard et al. 2007).  Fisher (2002, p. 14) argues that \u2018we live in a world whose \n13 \n \ninstitutions are increasingly dominated by \u201ccompetence control\u201d\u2019.  He avers that, as a \nresult of this regulation, it becomes increasingly difficult to take risks and move \nbeyond required performance indicators.  This over-emphasis on control and \npredictability eliminates the necessary space for innovation and creativity. \nEvaluation and Evidence of Effect \nThe current re-emergence of experimental criminology reflects attempts to predict \nand control the world around us (Hope 2009).  This desire to predict and control is \nprevalent in prisoner activities and demonstrates the preoccupation for knowledge \nbased on reason and scientific evidence, often to the detriment and exclusion of the \nspiritual or artistic.  This duality is by no means recent, Negus and Pickering (2004) \nnote that, since the concept of creativity has been used to mean the endeavour of \nartists, science, logic and reason have been set against creativity and spirituality.  We \ncertainly now exist in a political environment where \u2018Science is the largely \nunquestioned source of authoritative knowledge in the modern world\u2019 (Robinson \n2001, p. 142).  Creativity and spirituality might thrive in an environment driven by a \ndecency agenda, but given budget constraints, human resource, and prison estate \nissues, this may be more problematic than arguing for interventions which are \nprimarily focused on reducing reoffending and are \u2018proven\u2019 to work.  Research which \nillustrates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of criminal justice (as well as, for \nexample, education and healthcare) policies is required before interventions become \nprovided nationally (McGuire, Mason and O\u2019Kane 2000; Wrench and Clarke 2004).  \n\u2018What Works?\u2019 is, of course, the guiding principle for offending behaviour programmes \ndelivered in the Prison Service, however, this raises questions for artistic \/ spiritual \n14 \n \ninterventions, which might not easily fit into research paradigms or evaluation models \nacceptable to policy-makers.  The need to evidence effectiveness, in conjunction with \nthe methodological complexities of evaluation (Hollin 2008), often act as a barrier to \ncreative environments and the provision of alternative activities with prisoners.  How \nmight researchers provide robust evidence about the efficacy of interventions that \nsometimes do not identify reduction in reoffending rates as a key outcome (Hughes \n2005)?  This is particularly problematic when aims are ephemeral and do not lend \nthemselves to investigation via traditional evaluation methodologies (Matarasso \n1997), or where those delivering activities have a theoretical objection to the basis of \nevaluation objectives and ideals (Miles 2004). \nThere is much written about the impact of creativity and artistic interventions \nwith school children, harmed social communities and patients in hospitals (see, for \nexample, Hewitt 2004), but there seems to be little robust evaluative or research work \ncarried out on artistic or spiritual endeavours within criminal justice settings.  Whilst \nthere is increasing interest in researching the effects of spiritual practices from a \nhealth perspective (see, for example, Daaleman and Frey 2004), little exists in relation \nto the criminal justice setting.  In her literature review of practice and theory of the \narts in the criminal justice sector, Hughes (2005) found \u2018an abundance of success \nstories\u2019 (p. 7), but the ability to explain the reasons behind this success is still \noutstanding.  Methodological rigour was often missing in evaluation reports, perhaps \nnot surprising given Matarasso\u2019s assertion that \u2018people, their creativity and culture, \nremain elusive, always partly beyond the range of conventional inquiry\u2019 (1997, p. 72).  \nMiles and Clarke (2006) also reveal that many factors have prevented the arts from \nevidencing their effectiveness to the required standard of \u2018What Works?\u2019  Time, space, \n15 \n \ndiffering cultures, inadequate funding, limited group sizes, access to information, and \n\u2018a general reluctance among arts practitioners to break down and specify aims and \nobjectives\u2019 (p. 61) were all difficulties to be overcome.  To ensure that artistic and \nspiritual programmes do not continue to be the piecemeal, short-term funded \nprojects, not only within the criminal justice system but within social, community \nsettings too, (Matarasso 1997; Hughes 2005; Miles and Clarke 2006) a research base, \noutlining the positive impact of these interventions needs to be developed (Hewitt \n2004).  Discovering the mechanisms of effectiveness and positive outcomes is \nimportant as Matarasso (1997) found that that incomplete interventions and poorly-\nconceived and facilitated community arts projects, tended to have negative impacts on \nthe people and environments they were supposed to help and support.  This finding \nmirrors research that shows offenders who took part in offending behaviour \nprogrammes and did not complete them, were more likely to reoffend than those who \nhad never started a programme in the first instance (Hollin et al. 2008). \nThe methods associated with democratic evaluation consider public \naccountability to be at the core of the evaluative model.  In this role, the evaluator \nbecomes an information broker, passing the views of practitioners, participants and \nlocal organisations back to central government.  However, this means that these views \nare filtered through the ideological and methodological lenses of the evaluators, which \nmay act as a barrier to practitioner participation.  Yet, Greene (2006) goes on to note \nthere are people carrying out evaluation research that are committed to using the \nprocess as a form of liberation and empowerment for those they are evaluating.  This \ntakes the concept of evaluation to its very limit.  She notes that these people move \nfrom a \u2018value-neutral\u2019 position to a \u2018value-relative\u2019 one and then beyond to a \u2018value-\n16 \n \ncommitted\u2019 stance in evaluations.  This suggests that they support the ideological basis \nof the researched programme.  However, in carrying out research in a political \nenvironment which supports the pre-eminence of randomised control trials and value-\nfree evidence, value-committed research will not be considered to be an acceptable \nresource which will influence policy-making.  But, it might be possible to detect a more \ncourageous government response to work with prisoners that is beginning to \nrecognise \u2018the possibility of more than one path to truth\u2019 (Misra et al. 2006, p. 425).  \nMiles and Clarke (2006) note that the Home Office \/ Ministry of Justice\u2019s insistence on \nrandomised controlled trials as the only way of evidencing success is being reviewed.  \nPerhaps the punitive era of penal policy is about to make way for a more creative, \nholistic and sensitive response to prisoners\u2019 needs for as May (1976, p. 20) tells us: \nPeople who claim to be absolutely convinced that their stand is the only \nright one are dangerous.  Such conviction is the essence not only of \ndogmatism, but of its more destructive cousin, fanaticism.  It blocks off \nthe user from learning new truth, and it is a dead giveaway of \nunconscious doubt.  The person then has to double his or her protests in \norder to quiet not only the opposition but his or her own unconscious \ndoubts as well (italics in original). \n \nThe Need for Courage \nThose outside of the prison reform movement may find it difficult to accept the \nnotions of creativity and spirituality within the criminal justice system, as they are \noften linked to negative perceptions and reactions.  Prisoners taking part in comedy \nprogrammes, financially benefitting from memoirs of their offending or being \nradicalised rather than rehabilitated by their religious faith are viewed as \nunacceptable.  So it is perhaps unsurprising that government attitudes to these are \nmixed and sometimes uncoordinated; a point made by Baroness Stern in the debate \n17 \n \non Part 7 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.  She noted that \u2018writing, painting and \nmaking films are all better activities for society than violence, robbery and theft.  We \nshould welcome such rehabilitation and not take away the lawfully earned money of \nthe rehabilitated\u2019 (Lords Hansard 2009, cols 1288).  This not only illustrates unease \nwith creative processes in the criminal justice system, but underlines the notion of \ncommodification of offenders\u2019 artistic endeavours.  If the government continues to \npromote mixed messages about the role of artistic \/ spiritual interventions, for \nexample, playing a significant role in the Arts Alliance while at the same time curtailing \nthe promotion of non-traditional interventions with offenders through Prison Service \nInstructions, then how are practitioners and researchers to proceed in identifying, \ndelivering and assessing the impact of this work? \nWe conclude by arguing that courage is needed to develop and maintain creative \nresponses when working with prisoners just as methodological variety (Simons and \nMcCormack 2007) is necessary to capture and evaluate those approaches and the \n\u2018transformative effects\u2019 they can have (Hewitt 2004).  It is hoped that effective and \nmeaningful Third Sector partnerships will provide the impetus for such courage and \nthat cultural criminological ideals of having \u2018\u2026 a healthy disrespect for the rules by \nwhich it defines itself\u2019 (Ferrell et al. 2008, p. 161) will enable us to move this corner of \ncriminology forward too.  To consider the effect of artistic and spiritual endeavour \nmeans to theorise these concepts, the practice and the outcomes and to consider their \nrelationships with the traditional forms of intervention in prisons aimed at altering \noffenders\u2019 behaviour.  Miles (2004, p. 109) notes that the attempt of theorizing the \nimpact of artistic interventions seems to fall under one of five categories:  pedagogy, \napproaches to learning, delivery methods \/ facilitation, teaching, and attitudinal \n18 \n \nchange.  Some of these theoretical frameworks (delivery methods and attitudinal \nchange) have relevance to criminologists, but there are still elements missing.  Our \nproposition is that the impact of creativity may fit within the concepts of desistance \nand the related areas of social capital (Farrall 2004), for which we need to work \noutside of the normal, tightly-bound confines of conventional criminological thought \n(although we accept that for many criminologists there are no tightly-drawn \nboundaries).  Those who are more comfortable with the terminology of evidence-\ninformed policies and experimental methodologies, understanding and developing the \nlinks between the empirically informed psychological treatment programmes and \ncreativity \/ spirituality should certainly be part of this debate, with continued support \nfrom umbrella organisations such as the Arts Alliance.  Artistic and spiritual activity \nshould not just affect participants, but researchers and the prison environment \n(Wrench and Clarke 2004).  Initially researchers and practitioners should work together \nto develop methodologies that provide robust and meaningful data on the impact of \ninterventions that are acceptable to research participants and the policy audiences of \nthe reports.  As with all approaches to crime and offenders, there will be continuing \ndebate about the best ways to implement activities, as well as the ethics of providing \nthese types of opportunities funded by central government.  The goal in the medium \nterm should not simply be to affectively feel creativity is a human good that should be \nextended to those who have committed even the most unacceptable of crimes, but to \nempirically demonstrate that it can change people\u2019s behaviour for the better. \n \n \n19 \n \nNotes \n \n1With acknowledgement to Rollo May and his book of the same title \u2018The Courage to \nCreate\u2019. \n \nReferences \n \nAked, J. et al.
