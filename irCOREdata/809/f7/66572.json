They\u2019re like cryptic love letters. They make anything seem \npossible\u2019 (Jenkins 1997). \n \nIntroduction \nAt present it seems that maps are not a priority for food historians.  This is regrettable \nbecause, first, they are valuable as primary source materials in themselves (Black 1997), \nwhere cartographers, particularly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, have depicted \nvarious thematic elements of the food chain; and, second, they are also tools for present-day \nhistorians to use in the analysis of the spatial patterns that may be discerned in a wide variety \nof historical data.  In this article I will explore some of the technicalities of maps and the \nmeanings that they convey.  I will also provide a number of examples of the problems and \npossibilities raised by their use in food history.  First, I begin with some thoughts on why \nmaps should not be taken for granted.  I argue that their complex process of compilation \nleaves them open to critical interpretation, as much as any of the textual materials that we \nuse as historians.  Second, the mapping of food production is considered because this is the \nelement of the food chain given most attention by cartographers in the past.  Third, I \npropose that observed shortages or the absence of food stimulated the cartographic \nimagination in the nineteenth century.  The mapping of famine was an early example of how \ngovernments reflected on their obligations of monitoring the welfare of their people, what \nMichel Foucault has called \u2018biopower\u2019.  Interestingly, through attention to vulnerabilities of \nfamilies in poor countries, this type of cartography remains at the innovative cutting edge. \nFourth, I take commodity flows as illustrative of past attempts to depict connexions in the \nfood chain.  The maps of Minard and Gill are indicative examples.  Fifth, I touch on efforts \nfrom the early nineteenth century onwards to map restaurants and I discuss the recent \nconceptualization of \u2018food deserts\u2019, blanks in terms of retail access to healthy food.  Finally, \nthe end of the food chain is consumption; here I look at efforts to map cuisines and diet, \nnone of them wholly satisfactory.  This is an area of cartography begging further \ndevelopment. \n \nMaps:  medium or message? \nFood cartography falls into the category of special purpose mapping that first arose in the \nnineteenth century for the portrayal of themes such as agriculture, the transport of \nfoodstuffs to market, the sale of food in restaurants and retail shops, and also cuisines and \ndiets.  This was largely in the age of the map printed on paper, although there are countless \nearlier manuscript maps on parchment that record various aspects of food production.  \nMore recently, of course, we have progressed to viewing maps across the internet and the \nproducing them on Geographical Information Systems using the latest computer technology.  \nThe number of maps explicitly addressing food has increased noticeably in the Anglophone \nworld in line with a growing interest in the links between food and place.1   \n \nMap data comes in areal form (often based on administrative divisions), in points (specific \nlocations identifiable by coordinates), or in lines (such as transport arteries).  Over the \ncenturies the basic form of data available has influenced the design of maps, prompting the \ninvention of symbolisations such as choropleths (shaded areas), isopleths (contoured \nsurfaces), dots or some other proportional symbol, and flows (Robinson et al. 1995).  Many \nways have been developed to enhance the quality of the resulting visualization, such as \ncareful data classification, colour, and third-dimension effects.2  Recently, multivariate \n 3 \nmapping has helped our understanding of the relationships between different aspects of the \nfood system and reduced the need for series of maps of single variables.  Crop combination \nregions, for instance, have been widely used to capture statistical complexity in this way \n(Weaver 1954).   \n \nDespite these sophisticated innovations, maps remain technically limited in many ways.  \nThus map projections are necessary to enable locational information that in reality is \nwrapped around a sphere to be printed on a two-dimensional sheet.  These mathematical \nconventions are pure artifice yet they provide representations that have ready, naturalised \nmeanings for the viewer (Cosgrove 1999).  Scale is another major issue because the need to \noptimise readability means that only so much information can be included.  The \ncartographer must therefore decide how much of the earth\u2019s surface will be covered and \nwhat data to leave out.  Maps are samples and the information they leave out, their silences \nand pauses, is often as significant as their principal messages.   \n \nMaps employ a coded, visual language that must be interpreted by the reader.  A \u2018key\u2019 to the \nconventional symbols is usually provided but there are other, hidden, messages and \nmeanings that require deconstruction.  Its use of symbols makes cartography susceptible to \nanalysis by semiotics, a science pioneered by Saussure and Peirce and recently popular for \nreading visual images as a form of text (Keates 1996; Rose 2001).  This textual and linguistic \nanalogy has proved to be exceptionally fertile and maps are now seen as loaded with \nmeaning and discursively active.  Brian Harley (2001) is the scholar most associated with the \nidea of \u2018reading between the lines\u2019 of a map in order to understand the interests of its makers \nand their intentions, and then the implications for the map user.  He saw maps as having a \nhidden agenda beyond their apparently innocent, positivist face, and he sought to \u2018break the \nassumed link between reality and representation\u2019. \n \nMaps, then, are partial, because they serve a purpose.  The Enlightenment vision of maps as \nobjective and democratic knowledge for all to view and to utilise was a dream that could \nnever be fulfilled. Maps are far from neutral, objective mirrors of the world.  Rather they \nserve interests and are powerful weapons, not only in military campaigns but also in the \nstruggles that we fight daily at every level from the geopolitical frameworks of national \nterritories and identity, to the boundary disputes that we have with our next door \nneighbours.  The British were especially aware of the power inherent in spatial knowledge in \ntheir surveying and mapping of the empire.  Geographical skills were very much in demand \nin the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and cartography was a key facilitator of the \nexpansion in British economic and political influence.  It should be no surprise at all that the \nMap Room at the Royal Geographical Society has been a focus for generations of explorers \nand travellers, for maps were their key resource and making new maps was a much valued \nactivity.  The recent refurbishment and extension of the Society\u2019s building in London, \nopened in June 2004, placed special emphasis on improving access to its one million maps.  \nIn exploring the richness of this archive, one can get a feel for the significance of \ncartography as the hand maiden of empire (Driver 2001). \n \nFood production \nBy far the greatest proportion of cartographic energy devoted to food history has been in the \nmapping of food production.  Agriculture as a primary activity remained of major economic \nsignificance even in developed countries well into the twentieth century, and it was among \n 4 \nthe first economic sectors to be thematically mapped (Burnett et al. forthcoming).  In the \nearly modern period land use maps performed an inventory function and were sometimes \nused as tools in the collection of taxes.  The enclosure and tithe maps of England and Wales, \nfor instance, are a magnificent source of information about agriculture in the eighteen and \nnineteenth centuries, drawn at a large scale (Kain 1986; Kain et al. 2004; Kain & Prince \n1995), with details at the local level of divisions between arable and pasture and sometimes \neven the crops found in individual strips and fields.  There have been many other surveys of \nland use and agriculture that have yet to be exploited for their economic history value, such \nas the wartime National Farm Survey (1941-3)(Short 2000).  \n \nModern mapping of historical data has accelerated in recent decades, ranging from maps of \nthe origins of agriculture, and the reflexive embodied relationships between food production \nand evolving human physical anthropology (Simoons 1994), to the historical geographies of \nindividual products in sources as varied as the Domesday Book (A.D. 1086)(Darby 1977), \nand the computer mapping of agriculture (Coppock 1976).  Most recently, Geographical \nInformation Systems software such as ArcInfo and ArcView, has revolutionalised the \ncartographic treatment of the large historical datasets on agriculture and food, for instance \nthose held by the Arts and Humanties Data Service History portion of the Economic and \nSocial Research Council\u2019s UK Data Archive at Essex University.3   \n \nFamine \nThe European imperial powers took a close interest in the productive capacity of their \ndominions and colonies, for two reasons.  First, they wished to understand and exploit the \nnatural resources and local skills and, second, they sought to monitor the conditions under \nwhich their subject peoples lived.  This latter concern was partly a utilitarian consideration \nthat undernourished farmers might not produce sufficient of the raw materials required by \nthe factories of the home country, and partly a concern for the possible political \nconsequences of food riots.  As a result, to take the example of British South Asia, there is a \nrich vein of information on hunger and famine in the India Office Collections of the British \nLibrary.  Gazetteers, compiled for every district, record details of the farming and food \nhabits in each group of villages.  There are also many official reports and maps.  Among the \nmost revealing are the series of famine maps that illustrate the failure of entitlements over \nvast swathes of India in the nineteenth century.  Wyld\u2019s famine map published in 1878 thus \nshows the catastrophic famines of 1860-1 (Delhi), 1865-6 (Cuttack), 1873-4 (West Bengal), \nand 1877 (southern India).4  Similar maps were published for the Irish famine of the 1840s.  \nSuch mappings may be seen as detached indifference, or as the kind of surveillance that \nFoucault associated with power\/knowledge (Harley 2001; Wood 1992).  Another view is that \nthese maps were a form of modern technology that provided a shortcut to the efficient \nimplementation of the humanitarian elements of the 1883 Indian Famine Code, which in \nconditions of dire necessity was the basis for arranging the provision of food for work, and \nof food distribution in the worst affected areas.   \n Such food histories of famine and scarcity have much relevance to present concerns.  \nThe famine maps of the nineteenth century are the forebears of modern attempts to \nunderstand shortages and to design effective interventions.  Vulnerability mapping uses the \ngeo-referenced databases and spatial modelling capabilities of Geographical Information \nSystems and these are particularly powerful when they are used in conjunction with \nEnvironmental Remote Sensing.  Satellites can automatically gather information about \nrainfall, vegetation biomass and other surrogate indicators of the likely success of a harvest \n 5 \nand on this basis the authorities can plan for possible relief works by building up emergency \nfood supplies in regional stores (Cicone & Miller 2002).    \n \nCommodity cartographies \nThe mapping of commodity flows has a history stretching back to 1837 (Robinson 1982) but \nit has been less prominent than cartographies of points and areas.5  For food, this is because \nthere are fewer records of trade and transport that do full justice to the complexities of \nhistorical patterns than there are for agriculture.  National trading accounts provide a starting \npoint but at the sub-national scale it is rare that one can reconstruct the routes of food \nproduct movements from farms to market, thence to warehouse or processing factory, and \nonwards to the consumer.  Information exists at various points in the chain but linking the \nwhole is problematic.   \n One solution to the technical difficulties of flows is to map the sources of goods that \nwere transported to a single place.  This might be, for instance, any of the food commodities \nsupplying a large city.  Minard produced an early example of this in 1858 with his \u2018carte \nfigurative et approximative des quantit\u00e9s des viandes de boucherie envoy\u00e9es sur pied par les \nd\u00e9partements et consomm\u00e9es \u00e0 Paris\u2019 (Robinson 1967).6 It showed the outer boundary of \nthe supply area, and he inserted the quantities sent from each department in the form of \nproportional circles, divided into slices according to the type of meat.  This is a cartographic \nelaboration of the statistical \u2018pie charts\u2019 first used by William Playfair (Friendly & Dennis \n2004).  Another approach was to use lines of varying thickness to depict the quantities of a \ncommodity moving along a particular road, railway, river or canal.  Again Minard was a \npioneer, with an 1862 map of livestock carried to Paris by rail, followed in 1864 by a map of \nwines exported by sea from France to countries all over the world (Figure 1).7  Both are \nclearly and carefully drawn.  After his death, Minard\u2019s work was carried on by others in the \nannual Albums de statistique graphique (1879-97) of the Minist\u00e8re des travaux publics (Palsky \n1996). \n \n< Figure 1 here > \n \nSuch maps are not just technical curiosities.  They served the purpose of visualising \nthe assembly of raw materials that were essential to the economic development of the \nadvanced industrial powers.  In Britain commercial and commodity geographies were taken \nseriously, resulting in many books and articles richly illustrated with maps (Stamp 1937-80).  \nTrading food was especially important for Britain because of her decision in the 1840s to \nprioritise free trade over protectionism.  This favoured her industry and consumers but \nagriculture in the arable districts suffered from the competition of cheap foreign imports.  \nShe enthusiastically sourced foodstuffs from the Empire and beyond, therefore globalizing \nher diet at an early date.   \nOne example of a global food flow map that had implications for the politics of \nEmpire was Macdonald Gill\u2019s \u2018Highways of the Empire\u2019 published in 1927.  This was a \nposter 6 by 3 metres in size, printed in 48 sheets commissioned by the Empire Marketing \nBoard.  It was displayed on billboards nationwide.  Gill had been asked to show the links \nbetween Britain and her overseas territories by mapping the commodity trade routes, mainly \nfood.  His colourful design was popular and proved to be one of the most successful \ngraphics ever published by the EMB, furthering its goal of emphasising the continuing ties \nbetween centre and periphery. This was an Empire that was being restructured as an \neconomic entity to replace its flagging political and military raison d\u2019\u00eatre. \n 6 \n \nRestaurants and retail \nThe French love affair with food extended to cartography from an early period.  The idea of \na \u2018carte gastronomique\u2019, for instance, was established in the early nineteenth century.  The \nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France has one dated 1800, and another from 1810 that was \nalready in its sixth edition.8  An 1825 map was part of the long-running Almanach des \ngourmands.9 There are seventeen other such maps in the collection of the BNF up to 1939, \nwith those after the First World War catering increasingly for tourists, particularly \ngourmands in cars who were sufficiently mobile to seek out high quality restaurants.  There \nis a lot of scope for further research on the cartography of \u2018eating out\u2019, for instance in Great \nBritain using the rich series of commercial directories that record the locations of \nrestaurants, caf\u00e9s and pubs, and specialist publications such as The Good Food Guide (Warde \n2003). \nHistorical geographers have already taken an interest in evolving retail spaces from \nthe early nineteenth century (Benson & Shaw 1992) but a great deal more needs to be done.  \nAn exceptionally interesting recent development has been the investigation of the \nrelationship between retail provision and demand.  It has been found for the modern era of \nsupermarket dominance that store locations are often so inconvenient for certain groups in \nsociety, principally those without cars (elderly, disabled or poor), that one might reasonably \ndescribe certain parts of our large cities as being \u2018food deserts\u2019, where disadvantaged people \nhave poor access to food and a limited choice of the items that make for a healthy diet \n(Whelan et al. 2002).  The situation is equally serious in some rural areas, especially where \nvillage shops have closed.  Using a Geographical Information System and a knowledge of \nthe food habits of certain immigrant groups, Donkin et al. (2000) have taken this a step \nfurther by looking at the accessibility to particular ethnic foods of individual households.  \nWhile such a level of detail will be difficult to reproduce in an historical situation, \nnevertheless historians could profitably employ the general approach of GIS to plot the \nchanging provision and accessibility of various food services, such as markets, fixed shops, \nand catering establishments.   \n \nConsumption:  mapping the super-organic \nFifty years or so ago, geographers tended to see food habits as outcomes of regionalized \n\u2018cultures\u2019 that had evolved over centuries.  This work drew inspiration from Paul Vidal de la \nBlache (1845-1918) and Carl Sauer (1889-1975).  The approach, sometimes called \u2018super-\norganic\u2019 cultural geography (Duncan 1980) had a rather static view of a society in which \n\u2018typical\u2019 foods and dietary regimes could be associated with localities and regions and \ntherefore mapped.  We are still used to thinking in these terms with maps of cheese and wine \nregions (for instance Johnson 1971-2001; Eekhof-Stork 1976; France 1989; IGN 1989) and, \nin one sense, this version of food geographies has a nostalgic charm.  It values the deeply \nrooted traditions of the pays, rural communities that represent an antidote to the rapid and \nunsettling changes of urban-industrial modernity.10  There are still ethnographers who have \nmaintained an interest in the links between material cultures and place, and some of the \ncultural atlases produced in the twentieth century are now so old that they might be \nconsidered historical documents in their own right.11 \nEven now, a vision of the correlation between locality and traditional products has \nresonance among those consumers who seek out food from high quality, possibly organic, \nsmall-scale, artisanal producers as an alternative to industrially intensive supermarket \nproducts that lack a geographical identity.  A debate has arisen about \u2018food miles\u2019 and \n 7 \nwhether there should be a reduction of long-distance food trade in order to save on carbon \nemissions and to re-establish links in the consumer\u2019s mind with their own regional suppliers.  \nIn support of the high quality food and drink that is typical of particular regions, the \nEuropean Union in 1992 introduced lists of \u2018protected designations of origin\u2019, \u2018protected \ngeographical indications\u2019, and \u2018certificates of specific character\u2019.  Foods on these lists are \nlegally protected from unfair competition, for instance Parma ham, brioche Vend\u00e9enne or \nRoquefort cheese, and the process of designation performs a function similar to that of the \nFrench Appellations d\u2019Origines Control\u00e9es, which have played a major role in fixing the \nspatial specificities of wine (Larmat 1960). \n Claude Thouvenot (1978) used a super-organic framework in his study of food \nhabits in Alsace-Lorraine, a region divided between French and German linguistic groups.  \nHe assumed food to be a cultural marker, especially the differing preparation of the same \nraw materials.  His survey of 30,086 families who had children in primary school found that \nmany traditional dishes had survived. In the francophone region, red cabbage was still used \nin salad, soup was consumed in the evening and a regional cheese (cancoillotte) remained a \ntypical food (Figure 2).  In teutonic Alsace, red cabbage was cooked as a vegetable, soup was \na midday item, and typical foods included naveline (turnips fermented like sauerkraut) and \nonion tart.  None of these differences has any nutritional significance as far as we can tell, \nbut Thouvenot argued that they represent, and reproduce on a quotidian scale, the deep \ncultural divisions in this part of the Franco-German borderland that have their origins \nhundreds or even thousands of years ago.     \n \n< Figure 2 here > \n \n An alternative and more powerful approach might be to map the changing \ngeographical patterns of food purchases that are discernible in the various official, national \nand international databases.  The National Food Survey in Britain, for instance, has data \ngoing back to 1942, and there are other household databases that allow the statistical analysis \nof changing patterns of household consumption by variables such as income, family size and \ncomposition, and geographical location (Slater 1991).  One such, as yet undervalued by social \nscientists, is data collected by market research companies for the information of the food \nindustry.   \n \nConclusion \nPostmodern\/poststructuralist cultural geographers regard Thouvenot\u2019s type of analysis as \nna\u00efve, uncritical and potentially misleading.  They have long since abandoned the routine \nmapping of cultural objects and behaviours, regarding such activity with a degree of what \nGregory (1994) calls \u2018cartographic anxiety\u2019.  Greater emphasis is now placed on spatial \nprocesses that are not necessarily \u2018mappable\u2019 in the traditional two-dimensional sense.  \nRecent developments have preferred instead the theorizing of the network connexions \nbetween actors in the food chain (Goodman 1999), the geographical biographies of \ncommodities as a means of understanding consumption (Cook et al. 1998.; Castree 2004), \nand the hybrid, non-human geographies of GM food (Whatmore 2002).  In short, human \ngeography has moved on from its previous constitutive reliance on maps. \n \nMy guess is that most historians will be reluctant to follow their cultural geographical \ncolleagues into the deeper realms of theory.  They may well wish instead to make common \ncause with those historical geographers who continue to value mapping, and who \n 8 \nincreasingly are turning to Geographical Information Systems to answer the \u2018where?\u2019 \nquestion.  If so, there is a rich cartographic tradition to draw upon, but maps can never again \nbe seen as neutral and objective.  Our new awareness of their rhetorical power and their \nhidden agendas (Monmonier 1996) is a strength, not a weakness, and provides a platform for \ntheir critical use in food history. \n \n 9 \nAcknowledgements \nMy thanks are due to Peter Scholliers for suggesting this paper.
