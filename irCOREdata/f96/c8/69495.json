Children had to discriminate silly from true sentences, e.g. (`Do goats lay eggs?' or `Is your hand attached to your arm?') The total number of sentences presented in the task was 125 and the time allotted was 5 min, which was designed to ensure no child would complete the task. Children were tested in groups of up to 10. Using a guessing correction based on hits minus false alarms, gave a maximum score of 63 and a chance score of 0. Spelling. To test children's spelling, they were read out a total of 50 words and asked to spell the word on the sheet of paper they were given. The maximum score was 50. Arithmetic. There were two arithmetic tests \u00b1 one written and one oral. The oral arithmetic test was easier and given individually to all children in Grade 2 and those children in Grade 3 who scored \u00a3 6 on the written arithmetic test. The test covered basic numerical understanding including number recognition, counting and simple addition and subtraction of numbers one or two digits long. The score was the total number correct and the maximum score was 15. The written arithmetic was given in groups and tested more advanced numerical skills of numbers two to six digits long. The score was the total number correct and the maximum score was 30. Children not qualifying to do the oral arithmetic test were awarded the maximum score on this test of 15. Scores on the two tests were added together to get an overall score on arithmetic of 45.","cites":null},{"id":1016632,"title":"Tomkins A","authors":[],"date":"1992","doi":"10.1016\/0035-9203(92)90215-X","raw":"Savioli L, Bundy D & Tomkins A (1992) Intestinal parasitic infections: a soluble public health problem [editorial].

However, interpretation of results of many previous\nstudies has been complicated by the failure to control for many potentially confounding variables. We\ngave Tanzanian schoolchildren aged 9\u201314 a battery of 11 cognitive and three educational tests and\nassessed their level of helminth infection. We also took measurements of an extensive range of\npotentially confounding or mediating factors such as socioeconomic and educational factors,\nanthropometric and other biomedical measures. A total of 272 children were moderately or heavily\ninfected with Schistosoma haematobium, hookworm or both helminth species and 117 were uninfected\nwith either species. Multiple regression analyses, controlling for all confounding and mediating\nvariables, revealed that children with a heavy S. haematobium infection had significantly lower scores\nthan uninfected children on two tests of verbal short-term memory and two reaction time tasks. In one of\nthese tests the effect was greatest for children with poor nutritional status. There was no association\nbetween infection and educational achievement, nor between moderate infection with either species of\nhelminth and performance on the cognitive tests. We conclude that children with heavy worm burdens\nand poor nutritional status are most likely to suffer cognitive impairment, and the domains of verbal\nshort-term memory and speed of information processing are those most likely to be affected.\nkeywords schistosomiasis, hookworm, cognitive function, educational achievement, schoolchildren,\nobservational studies, Tanzania\ncorrespondence Matthew Jukes, Partnership for Child Development, Department for Infectious\nDisease Epidemiology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Imperial College School of Medicine,\nNorfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK.

Around 1300 million people are\nestimated to be infected with hookworm (Chan 1997).\nThese infections often occur concurrently (Lwambo et al.\n1999) and it is school age children who are most likely to\nsuffer the consequences of infection because they are\ngenerally more likely to harbour heavy infections (Savioli\net al. 1992).\nSevere and chronic helminth infection during this period\nin children\u2019s development could have consequences for\ntheir cognitive performance and ultimately their educa-\ntional achievement. These effects on cognitive function\nmay occur as a result of one or a combination of symptoms\nassociated with infection. For example, one of the main\nconsequences of infection with both parasites is iron\ndeficiency anaemia1 (IDA) (Farid 1993; Stoltzfus et al.\n1997b; Olsen et al. 1998; Beasley et al. 1999) and there is\nmuch evidence that IDA is associated with impaired\ncognitive performance and development (Lozoff 1990;\nwIndividual authors of this document were M.

Infection with hook-\nworm and S. haematobium can also result in poorer growth\nrates (Stoltzfus et al. 1997a; Warren et al. 1993) and this\nmay also be a route by which infection leads to impaired\nperformance because undernutrition affects cognitive\ndevelopment and educational achievement (Simeon &\nGrantham-McGregor 1990; Mendez & Adair 1999).\nWhilst these and other pathways provide the potential\nfor helminth infection to impair cognitive function, evi-\ndence remains equivocal as to whether this impairment\nactually takes place (Dickson et al. 2000). Among the\nlimited number of well-conducted treatment trials carried\nout to date, only two (Nokes et al. 1992; 1999) have found\na main treatment effect on tests of cognitive function. Other\nstudies have found improvements after anthelmintic treat-\nment only for subgroups of the study population (Simeon\net al. 1995a,b; Nokes et al. 1999) or no improvement at all\n(Gardner et al. 1996; Sternberg et al. 1997). In a review of\nthese studies, Dickson et al. (2000) conclude that the\nevidence for a cognitive benefit of deworming is \u2018not\nconvincing\u2019 (but see Michael et al. 2000). However, the\nfailure of treatment to improve cognitive function does not\nimply that helminth infection has no effect on cognitive\nfunction in the first place. It is quite possible that the effect\nof helminth infection on cognitive function is irreversible,\nor that recovery may depend on children receiving remedial\nteaching in addition to medical treatment (Sternberg et al.\n1997; Drake et al. 2000).\nIn such cases, treatment trials alone cannot give us a\ncomplete picture of the cognitive impairments caused by\nhelminth infection. Ideally, randomised controlled trials of\nprimary prevention of infection are needed to clarify this\nissue. However, such trials are often neither practical nor\nethical and to our knowledge none has been conducted to\nassess the impact of helminth infection on cognitive\nfunction. In the absence of evidence from such preventive\ntrials, the only way to measure the relationship between\nhelminth infection and cognitive function without simul-\ntaneously altering that relationship is to conduct well\ncontrolled cross-sectional studies. Such studies cannot\nestablish a causal relationship between infection and\ncognitive ability, but if sufficient care is taken to control for\na wide range of possible confounders they may allow us to\ninfer the likely profile of cognitive abilities that are affected\nby helminth infection in a way that treatment trials cannot.\nThe most likely confounding factor to affect studies of\nhelminth infection and cognition is poverty (Seifer 2001)\nand yet the majority of cross-sectional studies have failed\nto control for socioeconomic status (SES) (Watkins &\nPollitt 1997). Only six of more than 40 published studies\nhave controlled for SES (Simeon et al. 1994; 1995b; Levav\net al. 1995; Gardner et al. 1996; Sternberg et al. 1997;\nSakti et al. 1999) and only one has controlled for nutri-\ntional status (Sakti et al. 1999) which may affect cognitive\nfunction either independently or as a further index of\npoverty. There is clearly a need for cross-sectional studies\nthat make a comprehensive attempt to control for all\ncandidate confounders in order to provide evidence to\ncomplement that from treatment trials.\nOur research project in Bagamoyo, Tanzania addressed\nthese research issues using a combination of cross-sectional\nmethodology and a treatment trial. Here we report\nthe results of the baseline cross-sectional study examining\nthe association between moderate to heavy infections with\nhookworm and S. haematobium, cognitive function and\neducational achievement in schoolchildren. A major aim of\nthe study was to improve on previous work in this area by\nincluding a large sample of children and by assessing a\nmore comprehensive set of potentially confounding varia-\nbles including SES, anthropometric variables, malaria\nparasite density, and levels of haemoglobin, ferritin and\nC-reactive protein.\nMethods and subjects\nStudy population\nThe study took place in 10 schools in the coastal area of\nBagamoyo District and Kibaha District, Tanzania, about\n70 km north of Dar es Salaam. Children in these schools\nspoke Kiswahili at home and at school. School selection\nwas made after giving a questionnaire to children on self-\nreported schistosomiasis and blood in urine. The ques-\ntionnaire was based on that reported by Lengeler et al.\n(1991). Schools were asked to participate if they had a\nrelatively high reported prevalence of schistosomiasis\n(lowest reported prevalence by a selected school was 22%),\nhad more than 100 children enrolled in Grades 2\u20135, were\naccessible by road during the rainy season and had a rural\ncatchment area.\nIn the 10 participating schools there were 2454 regis-\ntered pupils. Of these, 1689 children met the age and grade\ncriteria, being between 9 and 15 years of age, in Grades\n2\u20135 inclusive, and within 2 years of the modal age for their\ngrade. Children were also excluded if the child had notable\nsevere clinical symptoms of infection with S. haematobium,\nif the child had severe mental handicap and\/or severe\nphysical handicap or if the child had chronic clinical\ndisease other than S. haematobium. Ten children were\nexcluded for such health reasons. Of the remaining 1679\nchildren, 1476 returned signed consent forms and 906 of\nthese were randomly selected for parasitological screening.\nAfter completing the larger study of which the current\ninvestigation was a part, all children received anthelmintic\nTropical Medicine and International Health volume 7 no 2 pp 104\u2013117 february 2002\nM.

A local doctor was attached to the project throughout\nto monitor the health of children in participating schools.\nAny illnesses identified by the project nurse were treated or\nreferred to the project doctor and district hospital.\nExperimental design\nBetween May and August 1997, a comparison was made\nbetween children with moderate-heavy hookworm\n(\u2021 400 epg)3 and\/or S. haematobium (\u2021 50 eggs\/10 ml)3\ninfections and those without significant helminth infection\non their performance on tests of cognitive and motor\nfunction and educational achievement.\nAs part of a larger study, half of the eligible children were\nrandomly selected for parasitological screening after stra-\ntifying within school and grade. Of those who were\nscreened, all children with moderate to heavy infection were\nrecruited. For every second moderately to heavily infected\nchild recruited in a class, an uninfected child in the same\nschool grade and of the same sex was selected to serve as a\ncontrol. If the ideal control was not available, a child of the\nopposite sex or from the grade above was selected. Where\ninsufficient uninfected controls were available within the\nschool, children with very light infections defined as those\nwith < 50 epg hookworm and < 5 eggs\/10 ml S. haemato-\nbium were also selected to participate in the study.\nApproval for this study was obtained from the Tanzania\nMinistry of Health and Ministry of Education and Culture\nat national, regional, district and ward level and also by the\nschools and teachers participating in the study. Ethical\nclearance was obtained from the Institute of Child Health,\nLondon, UK, and the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre,\nDar es Salaam, Tanzania. Children and parents had the\nstudy explained to them in Kiswahili and signed informed\nconsent was obtained from all children and their parents\nbefore measurements began.\nPsychometric tests\nA battery of educational tests measuring reading, spelling\nand arithmetic skills (detailed in the Appendix) was given to\nall children by two testers. With the exception of oral\narithmetic, which was administered individually, tests were\ngiven to groups of about 15 children in their classroom. The\neducational tests were completed before other psychometric\ntests were given. Half the children were also given tests\nmeasuring a range of cognitive and motor functions (see\nAppendix) by four testers. The test battery took 30\u201345 min\nper child to complete. Tests were presented in a fixed order to\nchildren and were organized so that tests placing the highest\ndemands were administered towards the end of the battery\nwhen children were familiar with the testing situation.\nTesters were blind to children\u2019s infection status.\nBoth educational achievement tests and tests of cognitive\nfunction were developed over a period of 1 year prior to\nthe start of the study to ensure face validity and content\nvalidity of the tests (correlations amongst tests and\nbetween school achievement and tests follow the predicted\npattern), to ensure that children were familiar and\ncomfortable with all testing materials and to ensure a test\u2013\nretest reliability of at least 0.7 for each test (Table 1).\nA novel test of reading ability was developed as part of this\nstudy (Alcock et al. 2000). All other tests had been adapted\nand chosen because they measured a range of abilities, had\nbeen shown in previous studies to be sensitive to the effects\nof hunger, undernutrition, IDA, other chronic illnesses or\nhelminth infection. Children were tested in Kiswahili by\ntesters who were fluent in this language. Testers were blind\nto children\u2019s infection status. All children received a snack\nand a drink before testing to ensure they were not hungry\nduring the test as short-term hunger has been shown to\naffect cognitive function (Pollitt & Mathews 1998).\nExplanatory variables\nChildren\u2019s date of birth was recorded from the school\nregister and from medical clinic cards. For 21% of\nchildren the full date of birth was available. For the\nremainder, only the year of birth was recorded, these\nchildren were assigned a birth date of 15th June.\nChildren\u2019s sex, class and school attended were also\nrecorded. Children were also given a structured interview\nindividually at school to find out about their home\nenvironment and their educational opportunities \u2013 char-\nacteristics that might affect their cognitive function and\neducational achievement.\n2 Children received a 400-mg dose of albendazole (SmithKline\nBeecham, Brentford, UK) on approximately three consecutive days\nfor the treatment of geohelminth infections and\/or a single 40 mg\/\nkg dose of praziquantel supplied by E. Merck Pharmaceutical\nDivision (Darmstadt, Germany) for the treatment of S. haemato-\nbium. A triple dose was considered necessary as the efficacy of\ngiving a single dose is not as high as a triple (Bennett & Guyatt\n2000). Children with light infections who were not included in the\nstudy were also treated for their infection status and received a\nsingle 400 mg dose of albendazole and\/or 40 mg\/kg praziquantel.\nAll treatment was supervised by a nurse.\n3 Cut-off points for schistosomiasis were determined from WHO\n(1985) recommendations. For hookworm, few children reached\nthe accepted definition of moderate infection (Montresor et al.\n1998). To provide a sufficient number of children for the treatment\ngroup, a cut-off point of around the 80th percentile was used.\nTropical Medicine and International Health volume 7 no 2 pp 104\u2013117 february 2002\nM. C. H. Jukes et al. Schistosomiasis and cognitive function\n106 \u00aa 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd\nBiomedical variables\nThree urine samples, taken on approximately consecutive\ndays, and one stool sample were collected from each child.\nFor the identification of S. haematobium infection, urine\nsamples were sent to the laboratory for microscopic\nexamination for eggs. A 10 ml sample was filtered through\na 12 mm diameter polycarbonate membrane with a 12 lm\npore size (Costar, UK) and the total number of eggs of\nS. haematobium was recorded as an indicator of the\nintensity of infection.\nFor the determination of hookworm and other geo-\nhelminth infection, stool samples were analysed in dupli-\ncate using the Kato-Katz technique. The total number of\neggs of hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris\ntrichiura and any other helminth species seen on each slide\nwas counted and the number of eggs per gram of faeces\ncalculated. A random sample of 10% of urine and stool\nsamples was screened a second time by the senior labor-\natory technician to check for accuracy of egg counts.\nThe following anthropometric measurements were taken\nfor each child. Height was measured using a portable\nstadiometer (CMS Weighing Equipment, London, UK) to a\nprecision of 1 mm. Weight was measured with a digital\nweighing scale (Soehnle, Germany) to a precision of \u008b50 g.\nChildren were weighed barefoot, wearing the school\nuniform. Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) was\nmeasured to a precision of 2 mm with a waxed paper\ninsertion tape (TALC, St Albans, UK) and triceps skinfold\nthickness was assessed by the mean of three repeated\nmeasurements to a precision of \u008b0.1 mm with Holtain\ncallipers (CMS Weighing Equipment, London, UK).\nHeight-for-age z-scores (HAZ, calculated with reference to\nNCHS data) and BMI were calculated using Epi Info\nsoftware (Dean et al. 1994).\nA 2 ml venous blood sample was taken from each child\nby a nurse. Thick and thin blood slides stained with 3%\nGiemsa were prepared and examined for malaria parasites.\nThe malaria parasite density was recorded as parasites per\n200 white blood cells. The concentration of haemoglobin,\nan indicator of anaemia, was measured photometrically\nusing a portable haemoglobinometer (Hemocue Ltd,\nSheffield, UK). The machine was checked daily against its\nown standard (Bridges et al. 1987). Concentration of\nferritin (an indicator of iron stores), and C-reactive protein\n(an indicator of an acute infection which may also lead\nto elevated ferritin levels independent of any increase in\niron stores) were measured by ELISA using commercial\nantibodies and standards as described in Beesley et al.\n(2000).\nData analysis\nThe aim of the first analysis was to examine associations\nbetween infection with both hookworm and S. haemato-\nbium in Tanzanian schoolchildren and their cognitive\nabilities and educational achievement, controlling for\nconfounding demographic and SES variables. A second\nanalysis aimed to examine whether any associations found\nin the first analysis remained statistically significant once\nmediating nutritional and other biomedical variables were\ncontrolled for.\nTable 1 Test\u2013retest reliabilities for tests of cognitive function, obtained by all four testers prior to the start of the study\nCognitive\/motor test\nMin.

C. H. Jukes et al. Schistosomiasis and cognitive function\n\u00aa 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd 107\nThe distributions of all cognitive and education test\nscores were examined for normality and transformed\nwhere necessary. Scores for the Stroop test (compatible and\nincompatible) were log transformed. Reciprocal transfor-\nmations were performed on both Pegboards scores (dom-\ninant and non-dominant hand), the Silly Sentences test and\nChoice Reaction Time. Reading and spelling tests both had\nbimodal distribution and were analysed as binary variables\nusing logistic regression procedures. In order to reduce the\nSEES data and identify underlying constructs, factor\nanalysis with varimax rotation was conducted with the\nsocioeconomic variables and the resulting factors used in\nthe analysis. This produced two factors related to econo-\nmic wealth, including one related to quality of house and\nlarger possessions (extracted from the following variables:\ntype of walls, roof, floor, water source, fuel, toilet, and bed,\nand the ownership of a fridge, a sofa, a cupboard and\ncows) and one related to smaller possessions (ownership of\na bicycle, a radio, tables and chairs) and also three school-\nrelated factors including books (number of books at home,\nnumber of exercise books and text books in the child\u2019s bag\nat time of interview), uniform (how complete uniform is,\nwhat state of repair uniform is in) and school equipment\n(number of pens and other miscellaneous items of school\nequipment). Intensity of helminth infection was coded into\ncategorical variables representing intensity above and\nbelow certain thresholds. S. haematobium infection was\ncoded into three categories: uninfected or lightly infected,\nmoderately infected and heavily infected, with thresholds\nat 50 eggs\/10 ml and 500 eggs\/10 ml of urine. Hookworm\ninfection was coded into a binary variable with infection\nabove or below the threshold of 400 eggs\/g of faeces. The\ncategory of heavy infection with hookworm (>4000 epg;\nMontresor et al. 1998) included only nine children (only\nfive of whom did cognitive tests), which was considered\ninsufficient to include in analyses as a separate group.\nMultiple linear regressions were performed to analyse the\neffect of helminth infection on cognitive function controlling\nfor possible confounding variables. Multilevel modelling\nusing the MLWin program (Rasbash et al. 2000) was used to\ncontrol for random effects at both child and school levels.\nSeparate analyses were conducted for each cognitive and\neducational test score. In the first analysis, regression\nequations were constructed as follows: First, age and sex\nwere entered into the regression equation. Second, three\ndummy variables were offered to control for the variation\nbetween the four testers who conducted the cognitive tests.\nThe third step involved controlling for potentially con-\nfounding factors. Infection with Plasmodium spp. and all\nfive SEES variables were offered. In this and all stepwise\nregression procedures used in the analysis, variables were\nadmitted into the equation at the P \u0088 0.05 level.\nAfter all potentially confounding variables were offered\nin the regression equation, the categorical helminth infec-\ntion variables were entered. Finally, interaction terms\nbetween all helminth infection variables and each of age,\nbody mass index, and height-for-age were offered to the\nregression. (Previous studies have shown that both age,\nSakti et al. 1999, and nutritional status, Simeon et al.\n1995a,b, can moderate the effect of parasitic infection on\ncognitive function.)\nThe second analysis was conducted for each of the\noutcome variables to determine whether any associations\nfound between infection status and psychological test\nscores were moderated by mediating variables. This\ninvolved a repeat of the first analysis with a fourth step\nincluded before parasitological variables were entered in\nthe equation. In this extra step all potentially mediating\nvariables (the nutrition and other health variables HAZ,\nBMI, Hb, MUAC, C-reactive protein concentration, ferr-\nitin concentration) were offered.\nGiven the large number of analyses performed, the\noverall error rate was controlled by the use of adjusted\nsignificance levels. Throughout cognitive test analyses a\nrevised significance level (a \u0088 0.010) was used following\nBonferroni corrections for multiple tests with correlated\noutcome measures (Sankoh et al. 1997).\nResults\nA total of 904 children were screened for their parasito-\nlogical status; 272 children qualified for the moderately to\nheavily infected group (160 were infected with S. haemat-\nobium only, 69 with hookworm only and 43 with both\nparasites) and 117 for the uninfected control group. All of\nthese 389 children were scheduled to take education\nachievement tests and 223 were scheduled to take tests of\ncognitive function. Complete records were available for\n338 and 203 of children who did the educational and\ncognitive test batteries, respectively, representing an aver-\nage loss of 13% resulting mostly from absenteeism on one\nor more of the days of testing.\nTable 2 describes all measures taken in this study.\nChildren are grouped by infection status: uninfected,\nmoderately infected with either species (there were no\nspecies-specific differences for these children), and heavily\ninfected with schistosomiasis. For moderately infected\nchildren no significant differences were found for any\nmeasure when children were grouped according to the\nspecies of parasite with which they were infected. Thus all\nmoderately infected children are grouped together in\nTable 2 and their data are presented along with those of\nuninfected children and heavily infected children. These\nthree groups were mutually exclusive.\nTropical Medicine and International Health volume 7 no 2 pp 104\u2013117 february 2002\nM. C. H. Jukes et al. Schistosomiasis and cognitive function\n108 \u00aa 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd\nAssociations with parasitological status\nAmong cognitive tests, the most consistent pattern of\nresults was observed for heavy infection with S. haemat-\nobium (Table 3). This was associated with lower scores in\nfour of the 11 tests of cognitive function:4 Digit Span\nForwards (P \u0088 0.003), Digit Span Backwards (P \u0088 0.004),\nSilly Sentences (P \u0088 0.003) and Choice Reaction Time\n(P \u0088 0.002). For Silly Sentences, the relationship resulted\nfrom interactions between heavy schistosome infection and\nheight-for-age (P \u0088 0.001). This was because children who\nwere both heavily infected with S. haematobium and\nstunted (HAZ < \u20132) had longer mean reaction times on the\nSilly Sentences test than other children (see Table 4).

C. H. Jukes et al. Schistosomiasis and cognitive function\n\u00aa 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd 111\nThere was a relationship between moderate S. haemato-\nbium infection and higher scores in the Digit Span\nBackwards task (P \u0088 0.09) which approached significance.\nModerate hookworm infection was not significantly rela-\nted to any of the cognitive tests. In addition, there were no\nsignificant associations between either worm infection and\nany of the three education tests.\nAssociations with other explanatory variables\nStunting (low HAZ) significantly predicted lower scores in\nthree cognitive tests, strengthening evidence of the link\nbetween cognitive development and undernutrition\n(Simeon & Grantham-McGregor 1990; Mendez & Adair\n1999). No other biomedical variable made a noteworthy\ncontribution to the variance in test scores. Among SEES\nvariables, the education-related factors had the greatest\nimpact on results, particularly for the education tests. The\nschool equipment factor predicted high scores on all three\neducation tests. This adds validity to the procedures both\nfor assessing SEES and for extracting relevant factors from\nthe wealth of data.\nDiscussion\nThis study provides the strongest evidence to date that\ninfection with S. haematobium is associated with impaired\nmental performance and, in doing so, contributes to a\nsubstantial literature implicating parasitic helminth infec-\ntions as a cause of retarded cognitive development\n(Watkins & Pollitt 1997). Our results corroborate those\nfrom treatment studies (Nokes et al. 1992; 1999; Simeon\net al. 1995a) in showing that cognitive function is impaired\nfor the most heavily infected children. In addition, the\nassociations found were independent of confounding\nfactors, such as SES, age, sex, malaria infection and other\nchronic infections, and variables potentially responsible for\nmediating the effect of parasitic infection on cognitive\nfunction such as nutritional indices and iron status.\nProblems with this interpretation of our findings arise\nfrom the cross-sectional design of the study. For example,\nwe have concluded that mild infection does not impair\ncognitive function. However, there are a couple of alter-\nnative explanations for the lack of association between\nmild infection and cognitve impairment.

Thus, associa-\ntions found in the current study may represent the effects of\ninfection levels over the past few years (for which current\ninfection status is a proxy) in addition to the effects of the\ncurrent parasitic load. Thus, those children with the\nheaviest current parasitic load may show the greatest\nimpairment because they are also the children who have\nharboured a worm burden for the longest period of time.\nSecond, there are known to be individual differences\namong children in exposure to schistosomiasis. More\nsociable and more active children are more likely to be\ninfected (Kvalsvig & Becker 1988). It is possible that\ncognitive function is also linked with risk of exposure (for\nexample there is a moderate relationship between curiosity\nand cognitive function (Alberti & Witryol 1994)) and that\nthis positive correlation could cancel out the negative\nrelationship between infection level and cognitive function\nat low levels of infection.\nA further problem of interpretation arises from the fact\nthat any association found in this study may have resulted\nfrom a codependence of cognitive function and helminth\ninfection on a third variable. Our study was designed to\nminimize this problem by including a highly valid measure\nof SES (PCD, in preparation) and by sampling a wide\nrange of other potential confounders, all of which were\ncontrolled for in final analyses. However, a more persua-\nsive argument that there is a genuine causal relationship\nbetween cognitive function and helminth infection comes\nfrom the profile of cognitive abilities impaired by helminth\ninfection. We found that having a heavy infection of\nschistosomiasis was associated with a drop in performance\nin the digit span forwards and backwards and with\nincreased reaction time in the Silly Sentences and Choice\nReaction Time tasks. No other tests were negatively\naffected by heavy schistosomiasis. There are two things to\nnote in this pattern of results. First, there are large\ndifferences from one test to another in the relationship\nwith helminth infection. In particular, the effect on the\nChoice Reaction Time task approaches 3 SDs, an extra-\nordinarily large effect for a psychometric test, whilst other\ntests show more moderate or nonsignificant effects. This is\nnot the pattern we would expect if the effect were based\nsimply on the fact that poor performance in cognitive tests\nand high parasitic loads tend to co-occur in the poorest\nchildren. On the contrary, SES, the environmental factor\nhaving by far the largest influence on performance in\npsychometric tests, tends to have an equal effect on all\ndomains of cognitive function (Seifer 2001). Second, the\ntwo domains showing the strongest relationship with\nhelminth infection were verbal short-term memory (digit\nspan forwards and backwards) and speed of information\nprocessing (choice reaction time and silly sentences). These\ndomains have also been affected in most of the other\ncross-sectional studies that have controlled for SES in their\nanalyses. Four of these five studies have found a rela-\ntionship between helminth infection and speed of infor-\nmation processing (Nokes et al. 1992; Simeon et al.\n1995a; Gardner et al. 1996; Sakti et al. 1999), three of the\nfive have found a relationship with the verbal short-term\nmemory (Nokes et al. 1992; Gardner et al. 1996; Stern-\nberg et al. 1997; Sakti et al. 1999). Together these studies\npresent an important pattern of results. As argued in the\nintroduction, the cognitive functions that recover after\nanthelmintic treatment (if any) are not necessarily those\nthat are affected in the first place, and so treatment trials\nare not in a position to, and so far have not been able to,\ninform us as to which cognitive functions are affected by\nhelminth infection. By contrast, well controlled cross-\nsectional studies may present the best opportunity to\nunderstand the profile of cognitive functions affected by\nhelminth infection. These studies are converging on the\nconclusion that speed of information processing and short-\nterm memory are the domains most affected.\nIt is essential that serious attempts are made to identify\nthe cognitive functions impaired by helminth infection \u2013 to\nlook at the type and not just the number of tests affected \u2013\nand consequently to formulate and test hypotheses con-\ncerning the mechanism for this effect. It is only when\ncognitive testing is used to address such specific hypotheses\nthat we may hope for some clarity to emerge from the\nuncertain results that permeate this field.\nOne promising hypothesis may emerge from the sub-\nstantial relationship between heavy schistosomiasis and\nreaction time found in the current study. This finding is\ncommon to cross-sectional studies in this field (as discussed\nabove) and is consistent with the notion that children with\nheavy worm loads suffer from lassitude and show poor\nTable 4 Breakdown of the interaction\nbetween height-for-age and heavy\nS. haematobium infection for the Silly\nSentences test.

C. H. Jukes et al. Schistosomiasis and cognitive function\n\u00aa 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd 113\nsustained attention. For example, Kvalsvig et al. 1991\nfound that heavily infected children performed more\npoorly than controls in a choice reaction time task (similar\nto the one used in the current study) but only in the latter\n15 min of the 30-min test. It is interesting to note that our\nreaction time tasks were both administered at the end of\npotentially tiring battery of cognitive tests.5 Previous\nstudies have, on the whole, failed to measure children\u2019s\nattentional capacity directly and thus it is possible that\nattention deficits underpin poor performance in some\ncognitive tests. This hypothesis provides an interesting\navenue for future research.\nIn conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate a\nrelationship between helminth infection and cognitive\nimpairment that is independent of confounding biological\nand socioeconomic variables. In addition, a comparison of\nthe results of this study with those of treatment studies\npoints to the value of using a variety of methodologies in\norder to understand the link between helminth infection\nand cognitive function. Both cross-sectional and interven-\ntion studies have important and unique contributions to\nmake in exploring the connection between helminth\ninfection and cognitive function. Furthermore, the two\nmethodologies map onto different practical solutions to the\nproblems caused by helminth infections. Observational\nstudies give us an indication of the (presumably cumula-\ntive) effect of infection whilst intervention studies tell us\nhow much of this effect can be reversed by treatment. In\nother words, large effects found in cross-sectional studies\nhighlight the need to prevent children from getting infected\n(or to treat their infection at an early age) whilst large\ntreatment effects would suggest that a cure can be as\neffective as prevention. Put into this framework, the results\nof the current study strengthen the case for prevention and\nfor giving all children the opportunity to learn and develop\nin the absence of helminth infection.\nAcknowledgements\nThe MAKWAMI project was funded by the James\nS.

In the\nforwards test the numbers are repeated in the same order as\nthey are read out, and in the backwards test, in the reverse\norder. For both tests there are three trials at each level,\nstarting with three digits in the forward condition and two\ndigits in the backwards condition. The test is discontinued\nif a child fails all three trials at one level. The score is the\ntotal number of correct answers. This is a test of verbal\nworking memory. The backwards test is also thought to\ntest executive function.\nGrooved pegboard\nThe time taken for children to place 25 grooved pegs into a\nboard is recorded. The first trial is completed with the\ndominant hand and the second with the nondominant\nhand. This is a test of psychomotor function.\nCorsi block\nThe test is a visuo-spatial equivalent to the Digit\nSpan Forwards test. There are nine blocks positioned on a\nboard. The examiner points to the blocks in increasingly\nlonger strings and the children have to replicate the\npointing sequence. There are three trials at each level,\nstarting with three blocks, and the test is discontinued if a\nchild fails all three trials at one level. This is a test of visuo-\nspatial working memory.\nVerbal fluency\nThis has two trials of one minute in which children name as\nmany animals and then as many foods as they can. One\npoint is given for each answer (disregarding duplicates) and\ntotalled. The test is designed to measure the scanning and\nretrieval of long-term memory. There is also a speed of\nprocessing component.\nStroop\nThe test was an adaptation of the Stroop test. It consists of\nfour trials each consisting of one page with 48 boxes\ncontaining either a tick (three) or a cross (eight). There are\ntwo trials with \u2018compatible\u2019 instructions, where children\nare asked to touch each box and say as quickly as possible\nwhether it contains a tick or a cross. There are also two\n\u2018incompatible\u2019 trials where children do the reverse, saying,\n\u2018tick\u2019 if the box contains a cross and saying \u2018cross\u2019 if the\nbox contains a tick. The time taken to complete each trial\nand the number of errors made were scored and from these\nthe time taken to complete 48 boxes without error was\ncalculated. (Where errors were made the time was divided\nby the proportion of correct answers.) The adjusted times\nwere totalled and averaged separately for both trials on the\ncompatible or the incompatible tests. The test is designed\nto measure executive function (Baddeley 1992).\nSpanish vocabulary learning\nAdapted from a French Vocabulary Learning test by\nBaddeley et al. (1995) designed for Jamaican children, this\ntest consists of 16 familiar pictures whose names were to be\nlearnt in Spanish. Spanish is not taught in school, is easy\nfor testers to pronounce and is not spoken in East Africa so\nwas considered equally unfamiliar to all children. Initially,\nchildren were told the names of four pictures and then\nasked to point to the correct pictures when the tester\nrepeated the names. After two correct trials, four more\npictures were named and they were then asked to point to\nthe eight pictures in turn when they were named. This was\nrepeated introducing four new pictures every time the child\npointed correctly to all named pictures on two consecutive\ntrials. A total of eight trials was given. The score was the\ntotal number of correct responses. It was designed to\nmeasure paired-associate learning.\nComputerized tests\nThere were two computerized tests requiring the following\nequipment: Apple Mac portable computer, Psyscope soft-\nware, a button box and speakers. Computers were unfa-\nmiliar to all the children in the study so the equipment was\nhidden prior to use and care was taken to introduce it in a\nsensitive and appropriate manner. Children were familiar\nwith radios and audio speakers and most were comfortable\nwith the set-up.\nAuditory choice reaction time\nChildren\u2019s reaction time was measured when choosing\nwhich of two pictures matched an auditory stimulus.\nAbove the red button on the button box was placed a\npicture of a dog and above the green button, a picture of a\nchick. Children were asked to press the red (dog) button\nas quickly as possible after hearing the sound of a dog\nTropical Medicine and International Health volume 7 no 2 pp 104\u2013117 february 2002\nM. C. H. Jukes et al. Schistosomiasis and cognitive function\n116 \u00aa 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd\n(\u2018woof woof\u2019) and the green (chick) button after hearing\nthe sound of a chick (\u2018cheep cheep\u2019). The auditory stimuli\n(dog or chick) were presented in random order. The\npractice trial contained 10 stimuli and the main test 60\nstimuli. The computer recorded each reaction time and\ncalculated the mean reaction time for all responses exclu-\nding incorrect responses and those with reaction times\ngreater than three standard deviations above or below the\nmean.\nSilly sentences\nThe Silly Sentences test was computerized and based on the\nsilly sentences task (Baddeley et al. 1992). Two lists of 40\nquestions requiring either a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 response, were\npresented to children over the speakers. Each child was\nrandomly assigned one of the two lists. For example,\nchildren were required to answer the question as quickly as\npossible by pressing the appropriate button on the button\nbox. There were two practice trials of 6 and 10 questions. In\naddition, to assist children, a tick symbol was placed above\nthe green button for \u2018yes\u2019 and a cross symbol above the red\nbutton for \u2018no\u2019. The test score was the mean reaction time\nfor correct answers, excluding responses longer than three\nstandard deviations above the mean response time. The test\nwas designed to measure auditory speed of processing.\nEducational achievement tests\nReading tests. These tests were developed specifically for\nthe study. Traditional reading tests proved unsuitable\nbecause Kiswahili is a regularly spelt language which\nmeans that children can correctly read words out loud\nwithout understanding their meaning. Three tests were\ndeveloped and presented in increasing order of difficulty.\nThe letter reading and word reading tasks were given to all\nchildren. Sentence reading was given to all children scoring\n\u2021 9 (hits \u2013 false alarms) or \u2021 21 (total score) on the word\nreading task. The scores (hits \u2013false alarms) for the letter,\nword and sentence reading tests were added together to\nproduce a composite reading score. Note that a hit is when\na real letter\/word\/sentence is correctly identified as real. A\nfalse alarm is when a false letter\/word\/sentence is incor-\nrectly identified as real.\nLetter reading. Children had to discriminate letters and\nnon-letters by putting a tick or a cross next to the test item.\nThere were 12 letters and 12 non-letters presented in\nrandom order. Letters that resembled Arabic letters were\nexcluded during piloting as many children in the study also\nattended a Koran school. A standard guessing correction\nwas applied by subtracting the number of false alarms from\nthe number of hits. The maximum possible score was\ntherefore 12 and a score of chance was 0.\nWord reading. Children had to discriminate words from\nnon-words in the same way as for the letter reading task.\nThere were 12 words and 12 non-words. Words were\ntaken from school reading books. A guessing correction\nwas again used, hence the maximum possible score was 12\nand a score of chance was 0. There were two parallel\nversions of this test and children were randomly assigned\nto receive either Version A or Version B.\nSentence reading. The test was based on the Silly Sentences\ntask (Baddeley et al. 1992) and was intended to measure\nspeeded comprehension for better readers. Children had to\ndiscriminate silly from true sentences, e.g. (\u2018Do goats lay\neggs?\u2019 or \u2018Is your hand attached to your arm?\u2019) The total\nnumber of sentences presented in the task was 125 and the\ntime allotted was 5 min, which was designed to ensure no\nchild would complete the task. Children were tested in\ngroups of up to 10. Using a guessing correction based on\nhits minus false alarms, gave a maximum score of 63 and a\nchance score of 0.\nSpelling. To test children\u2019s spelling, they were read out a\ntotal of 50 words and asked to spell the word on the sheet\nof paper they were given. The maximum score was 50.\nArithmetic. There were two arithmetic tests \u2013 one written\nand one oral. The oral arithmetic test was easier and\ngiven individually to all children in Grade 2 and those\nchildren in Grade 3 who scored \u00a3 6 on the written\narithmetic test. The test covered basic numerical under-\nstanding including number recognition, counting and\nsimple addition and subtraction of numbers one or two\ndigits long. The score was the total number correct and the\nmaximum score was 15. The written arithmetic was given\nin groups and tested more advanced numerical skills of\nnumbers two to six digits long. The score was the total\nnumber correct and the maximum score was 30. Children\nnot qualifying to do the oral arithmetic test were awarded\nthe maximum score on this test of 15. Scores on the two\ntests were added together to get an overall score on\narithmetic of 45.\nTropical Medicine and International Health volume 7 no 2 pp 104\u2013117 february 2002\nM. C. H.
