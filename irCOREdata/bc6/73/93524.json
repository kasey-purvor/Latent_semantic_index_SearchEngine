Estimates for the incremental\ncost and effectiveness per epoch over the full 12-month period are presented. Using the\nestimates of 200 bootstrap samples, we demonstrate how one drug is cost-effective\ncompared with another.\nKeywords: Observational studies, Cost-effectiveness, Longitudinal data, Epoch analysis\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard\nfor assessing efficacy and safety of healthcare technologies,\nincluding pharmaceutical products. They can demonstrate\nwhether a healthcare intervention works in a defined popula-\ntion and have a high internal validity, as patients are randomly\nallocated to protocol-driven treatments with strict study en-\ntry criteria. However, these same features may restrict the\ngeneralizability of the findings to the everyday clinical set-\nting. Government agencies, such as the French Transparency\nCommittee, therefore, request that pharmaceutical compa-\nnies demonstrate the effectiveness of their products in an\neveryday clinical setting. Observational studies are, thus, a\nuseful nonexperimental complement to RCTs (9).\nEpidemiological observational studies that longitudi-\nnally follow-up cohorts of individuals in a naturalistic setting\nwithout randomization to treatment, have traditionally been\nperformed to determine whether there is an association be-\ntween disease status (e.g., heart disease) and exposure to\ncertain factors (e.g., cholesterol level or smoking) (17). This\ntype of study design, however, can also be used to determine\nwhether there is an association between the drugs adminis-\ntered and their effectiveness.\nData showing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical\nproducts are also increasingly required for access and re-\nimbursement, particularly in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Observational stud-\nies are a useful vehicle for determining whether there is a\ndifference in the costs (and hence cost-effectiveness) associ-\nated with the drugs administered outside of the experimental\nsetting.\nNonrandomized studies are more prone to bias, however.\nThey are at particular risk of selection bias if investigators\nselect patients for treatments on the basis of the characteris-\ntics of the patient or their disease, thus leading to systematic\ndifferences between comparison groups (4).\nThe convention is to adjust for differences in risk or\nprognostic factors to avoid confounding. This strategy as-\nsumes that the researchers know the most important prog-\nnostic factors and that these factors have been measured ap-\npropriately in the study (3). Even if appropriate adjustments\ncan be made, observational studies still pose methodological\nproblems, as in everyday clinical practice patients may be\nprescribed more than one medication and frequently switch\nmedications. This finding raises the issue of how to attribute\nthe medication effects to the outcomes of interest. This study\ndescribes a novel method of analysis, the so-called epoch\nanalysis, to address this issue. It uses the economic analy-\nsis conducted as part of the Schizophrenia Outpatient Health\nOutcomes (SOHO) study as an illustrative case (6;7), where\nthe specific outcomes of interest are the incremental cost and\nquality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained as derived from\nthe health-related quality of life instrument EQ-5D (Euro-\nQol) (2).\nThe proposed method of analysis allows alternative esti-\nmation approaches to be used to take into account the skewed\nnature of the cost data (10). It uses an adaptation of the Man-\nning and Mullahy (10) method for choosing among the alter-\nnative estimators and uses the Poisson estimator to estimate\nthe cost models.\nSOHO and Schizophrenia\nThe European SOHO study is the largest naturalistic study\nof antipsychotic drugs conducted to date (6;7). It is a 3-year,\nprospective, observational study of the outcomes of antipsy-\nchotic treatment for schizophrenia in the outpatient setting.\nOne of the main objectives of SOHO is to understand the\ncomparative costs and outcomes of therapy for schizophre-\nnia with olanzapine versus other antipsychotic medications\nin a clinical setting.\nThe SOHO study is being conducted in ten European\ncountries with 1,096 investigators participating. A total of\n10,972 patients with schizophrenia starting or changing med-\nication in the outpatient setting have been enrolled in SOHO,\nundergoing evaluation at regular time intervals (at enrollment\nand at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months). Data collected in-\nclude patients\u2019 prognostic characteristics and other potential\nconfounding characteristics; health service resource use such\nas medication use, the number of hospital inpatient and out-\npatient visits; and patient self-reported EQ-5D health state\nclassifications (2). Details of the study methods have been\npublished elsewhere (6;7).\nAll patient care was at the discretion of the participating\npsychiatrist; no specific instructions were included in the\nstudy description. SOHO is essentially observing a window\nof 3 years of care in the patient\u2019s schizophrenia treatment\npath.\nINTL. J. OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE 22:4, 2006 461\nWindmeijer et al.\nThis study focuses on the economic analysis for the first\n12 months. As expected (3), outside of the experimental set-\nting of an RCT, a sizeable proportion of patients (31 percent)\nswitched their antipsychotic medication during follow-up\nor added another antipsychotic medication to their baseline\ntreatment.\nMETHODS\nAllocation of Treatment Effects\nThe objective of the analysis is to estimate the treatment ef-\nfects on costs and change in EQ-5D tariff or utility score (2)\nof the drugs taken by the patients. Difficulties arise with con-\nventional methods of allocating and interpreting such effects\nwhen patients frequently switch medication. With intention-\nto-treat analysis, the recommended method for analyzing\nRCTs, the treatment effects are attributed to the medication\ngiven at study entry. When patients frequently change med-\nication, this type of analysis could favor less effective med-\nications at study entry if patients are subsequently switched\nto more effective medications.\nThe treatment effects of each drug could be allocated in\nproportion to the duration of treatment on the drug, as in an\nexposure approach. For example, if drug A was taken for 3\nmonths and drug B subsequently for 9 months, then over the\n12-month period, 25 percent of the 12-month effectiveness\nwould be attributed to drug A and 75 percent to drug B. This\nstrategy assumes effectiveness is additive and linear with du-\nration, which may not be realistic. The linearity assumption\nof course can easily be relaxed, but it is not clear what the\nappropriated functional form would be.\nA new method of analysis, thus, was needed to attribute\ntreatment effects directly to the antipsychotic medication\ntaken by the patients. For the purposes of this data anal-\nysis, we divided the data into three epochs: 0\u20133 months,\n3\u20136 months, and 6\u201312 months (hence the name epoch anal-\nysis). To maximize the data used, a patient may contribute\nmore than one observation per epoch. Each epoch provides\ninformation on the treatment effects during the respective\ntime period.\nUsing a hypothetical example, we describe here how\nthe treatment effects are assigned using the epoch analysis.\nDuring the 12 months of data collection, we have four ob-\nservations per patient (enrollment, 3, 6, and 12 months after\nenrollment, referred to below as t = 1, 2, 3, and 4).\nFor simplicity, assume that a patient can receive one of\ntwo drugs during the observation period: drug A or drug B.\nImagine that a patient receives drug A for the whole 12-month\nobservation period (see Figure 1a). The first epoch provides\ninformation on the treatment effect of drug A over the first\n3 months of treatment. The second epoch provides informa-\ntion on the treatment effect of drug A over the subsequent\n3-month period of treatment conditional on being treated\nwith drug A during the first 3 months of treatment. The\nthird epoch provides information on the treatment effect of\ndrug A over the last six months conditional on having been\ntreated with drug A during the previous 6 months. Being on\nthe same treatment in the prior period is instrumental as it\nprovides the necessary conditions for combining the three\ntreatment effects to provide a cumulative treatment effect\nover the 12-month period.\nNow imagine that a second patient switches to drug B\nafter 3 months of treatment with drug A (see Figure 1b).\nThe first 3 months of treatment with drug A contributes to\nthe first epoch, depicted as Epoch 1A. The patient, however,\ninitiates a new medication at time t = 2, which is effectively\na new baseline observation; hence, the first 3 months of drug\nB contribute to the first epoch, depicted as Epoch 1B. For\nthis patient, two observations contribute to the first epoch:\none for drug A and one for drug B. In this case, data from\nthe second 6-month observation period cannot be analyzed\nas Epoch 2 for drug B as the time period is not consistent\nwith the analysis (3 months).\nA third patient switches medication from drug A to drug\nB at observation t = 3 (see Figure 1c). For this patient,\nEpoch 1 and Epoch 2 are used as for patient one. Data from\nthe second 6-month observation period cannot be analyzed\nas Epoch 1B, however, as the time period is not consistent\nwith the analysis (3 months).\nAs pointed out above, some observation periods for var-\nious patient types are not being used for the estimation of the\ntreatment effects due to the unequal time periods. As further\nobservation periods become available with the SOHO data,\na more efficient use of the patient observations may be to\nanalyze the data in 6-month epochs. However, as most of the\nbenefits of antipsychotic medications tend to occur during\nthe first 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, we decided to keep the\nduration of the first two epochs as 3 months for the 12-month\ndata analysis.\nEstimation Issues\nMultivariate regression analysis was used to examine the\nimpact of treatment on costs and EQ-5D tariff, adjusting\nfor confounding effects to take account of selection bias\n(4). To allow for flexible treatment effects over time, we\nestimate separate coefficients for the different epochs. The\nthree regression models used to model costs and outcomes\nare:\nFirst Epoch.

Denote Yi4,6|6 as the dependent variable for\nthe third epoch, a 6-month period, given that the patient\nalready had 6 months of continuous treatment on the same\nmedication. The model is then specified as:\nYi4,6|6 = f\n\u239b\n\u239dx \u2032i1\u03b26|6 +\nJ\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b4j6|6Dij4 +\n3\u2211\nk=2\n\u03b1k6|6Mikt + ui4,6|6\n\u239e\n\u23a0\nwhere \u03b26|6 measures the effects of the baseline covariates,\nand \u03b4j6|6 are the incremental treatment effects.\nWhen the dependent variable is the change in EQ-5D tar-\niff data, the models are estimated using ordinary least squares\n(OLS), that is, a linear f for each of the three epochs. When\nthe dependent variable is cost, f is specified as an exponential\nmean function to take account of the skewed distribution of\nthe cost data. Although the cost data are clearly nondiscrete,\nthe parameters can be consistently estimated using standard\nPoisson regression models. A modified Park (15) test devel-\noped by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (18) indicated that this\nspecification is adequate for these data relative to other types\nof distributions, such as the Gamma or inverse-Gaussian.\nAlso, unlike the latter, the Poisson specification gives equal\nweight to extreme values (18), which is advantageous as data\nfrom patients that are high resource users should be given\nequal weight to those from low resource users.\nIncremental Cost and QALYs Gained over\n12 Months\nWhen an exponential function is used, the estimated treat-\nment effects are multiplicative such that (exp(\u02c6\u03b4j ) \u2212 1) gives\nthe estimated percentage change in treatment cost. To cal-\nculate the incremental cost, we took as a reference cost the\naverage predicted cost for the sample as a whole, assuming\nthat all patients were drug B users. For example, for the first\nepoch:\n\u02c6CB3 =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\nexp(x \u2032i,t\u22121 \u02c6\u03b23 + \u03b3\u02c6 Sit )\nwhere \u02c6\u03b23 and \u03b3\u02c6 are the estimated coefficients. The incremen-\ntal costs for drug j are then calculated as (exp(\u02c6\u03b4j3) \u2212 1) \u02c6CB3 .\nThe total cost differentials over the 12-month period can be\nobtained by adding up the incremental costs figures over the\nthree epochs.\nAs discussed above, when the dependent variable is the\nchange in EQ-5D tariff data, the models are linear and es-\ntimated by OLS. To estimate the QALYs gained using the\ncoefficients from the models for change in EQ-5D, the ad-\nditional QALYs gained over the 12-month period for drug j\nrelative to drug B were approximated by:\nQALYgained over 12 months\n= ((3\/12) \u00d7 \u02c6\u03b4j3) \u00d7 0.5 for the first epoch\n+ (3\/12) \u00d7 \u02c6\u03b4j3) + ((3\/12) \u00d7 \u02c6\u03b4j3|3)\n\u00d7 0.5 for the second epoch\n+ (6\/12) \u00d7 ( \u02c6\u03b4j3 + \u02c6\u03b4j3|3)+ ((6\/12) \u00d7 \u02c6\u03b4j6|6)\n\u00d7 0.5 for the third epoch\nThe above numerical presentation is equivalent to measuring\nthe area under the curve of the difference in treatment effects\n(see Figure 2).\nFor the cost and change in EQ-5D models, adding up the\neffects was only possible as the models for the later periods\nwere conditional on the patient having continuous treatment\nup to the point of analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness\nratio (ICER) was finally estimated as the incremental costs,\nas estimated above, divided by the QALYs gained over the\n12-month period.\n464 INTL. J.

Estimating quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from model coefficients.\nDealing with Uncertainty\nUncertainty in the analysis can be addressed using conven-\ntional statistical techniques such that standard errors of the\n\u02c6\u03b4 coefficients and the associated confidence intervals can be\nestimated for each of the regression models to show param-\neter uncertainty within each epoch.\nUncertainty in the sampling was addressed by using non-\nparametric bootstrapping to replicate the incremental treat-\nment effects. Two hundred samples were sampled randomly,\nwith replacement from the data of each patient, each sam-\nple providing data to estimate the corresponding incremental\ncost and QALYs gained (1). Uncertainty in the ICER decision\nrule was addressed using the bootstrap replications of incre-\nmental costs and utilities to calculate the cost-effectiveness\nacceptability curve of drug A compared with drug B. Each\nreplication of the incremental costs and utilities was used to\nre-estimate the ICER. The probability that drug A is cost-\neffective compared with drug B was estimated as the pro-\nportion of replicated ICER falling below a specified value\nassigned to the willingness to pay for a QALY gained. For\nexample, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence thresh-\nold for the willingness to pay for QALY gained is around\n\u00a330,000 (5).\nRESULTS\nWe present an example of the above methodological frame-\nwork, whereby the incremental cost and additional QALYs\ngained are estimated for one antipsychotic, drug A, relative\nto drug B, using the first 12 months of data on resource use\nand EQ-5D tariffs collected within the SOHO study.\nFor purposes of this study, we have used UK unit costs\nfor medication use, hospital inpatient days, psychiatric ses-\nsions and day care. These unit costs were taken from pub-\nlished sources (11\u201314) and applied to volume of resource\nuse taken from the pan-European SOHO data. The treatment\nassigned to the epoch was assumed to be the medication\nreceived immediately before the assessment visit. Table 2\ngives the incremental treatment effects on costs and changes\nin EQ-5D tariff estimated for drug A compared with drug\nB for each of the epochs. The results show that the total\ntreatment costs for patients using drug A are on average\n\u00a381 higher than those for patients treated with drug B in\nthe first epoch, although there is quite a large uncertainty\nattached to this finding, as indicated by the large bootstrap\nstandard error of 58. In contrast, for the second and third\nepochs, the total treatment costs for patients using drug A\nare on average \u00a3114 and \u00a3157 lower, respectively, than for\npatients using drug B. Over the 12-month period, the total\ntreatment costs are, therefore, on average \u00a3190 lower for\npatients using drug A, with a bootstrap standard error of\n130.\nThe estimation results of the model for changes in EQ-\n5D show that drug A is less effective than drug B for the\nfirst 3-month epoch. The estimated coefficient is \u22120.0443\nwith a very small bootstrap standard error of 0.0066, indi-\ncating that this finding is a statistically significant incremen-\ntal difference. For the second epoch, the estimated \u02c6\u03b4A3|3 is\nvery close to zero, \u22120.0034, and not significant. In the third\nepoch, drug A is again marginally less effective, with an es-\ntimated incremental difference of \u02c6\u03b4A6|6 = \u22120.0117, with a\nbootstrap standard error of 0.0077. The resulting incremen-\ntal QALYs lost for drug A users over the 12-month period is\nINTL. J. OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE 22:4, 2006 465\nWindmeijer et al.\nTable 2.

Figure 3\npresents the incremental cost-effectiveness plane using the\nincremental cost and effectiveness estimates from the 200\nbootstrap samples. These give a good indication of the un-\ncertainty associated with the incremental cost per QALYs\ngained. Also shown for the purpose of illustration is the\n\u00a330,000 per QALY gained threshold. If this threshold is\ntaken as society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY gained,\nthen the probability that drug B is cost-effective relative to\ndrug A is 1, as all the bootstrap ICER estimates show the\nincremental cost per QALY gained to be below the \u00a330,000\nthreshold.\nThe cost-effectiveness acceptability curve depicted in\nFigure 4 shows the probability of drug B being cost-effective\ncompared with drug A. The probability of being cost-\neffective increases to 1 for values of around \u00a316,000 per\nQALY gained or more.\nDISCUSSION\nObservational studies offer the opportunity to study patients\nin the everyday clinical setting. Unlike RCTs, where the treat-\nments are protocol driven and there are strict entry criteria,\nobservational studies can reflect the complexity of everyday\nclinical practice. The course of treatments within the obser-\nvation period, thus, can vary significantly between different\npatients or practices. This finding is important in schizophre-\nnia where it is well known that patients change medication\nfrequently (3).\nIn economic evaluation, the effects of each drug or treat-\nment on costs and effectiveness have to be estimated. This\nstudy presents a methodological framework that allows the\ntreatment effects to be estimated in a longitudinal observa-\ntional study where some patients have switched their medi-\ncation or treatment.\nThe proposed epoch analysis is possible as the observa-\ntional study is a \u201cwindow\u201d in the patients\u2019 treatment pathway.\nIn the SOHO study, switching medication within the study\nis equivalent to the entry criteria into the study. Switching\nmedication, thus, is essentially equivalent to a new baseline\nmeasurement. However, it assumes that there is no carry over\nof effects into the following epoch, which effectively means\nthat the effects of the medication wear off as soon as the\nmedication is discontinued.\nOne of the main advantages of the epoch analysis ap-\nproach is that it is able to use data from all types of pa-\ntients; from those who remain on the same therapy through-\nout follow-up to those patients who took a combination of\nmedications and\/or change medication.\nCombination treatments are not modeled as separate\ntreatments. Instead, if a patient is taking more than one an-\ntipsychotic treatment, then the effects are attributed to each of\nthe treatments received, and a \u201ccorrection\u201d combination coef-\nficient is fitted in the model by incorporating binary indicator\nvariables for combinations of two or three antipsychotics.\nTo control for the fact that the patients with repeated\nobservations for the first epoch may be inherently different\nfrom those patients who do not switch treatment, a switch-\ning\/repeated observation binary indicator is fitted in the mod-\nels. The proposed approach allows for an accurate measure-\nment of the short-term effects of a medication and provides\nthe opportunity to use this information when estimating the\ncumulative measure of effectiveness of treatment. This fea-\nture is important in schizophrenia as it is expected that most of\n466 INTL. J.

Longitudinal\nobservational studies provide a vehicle to address these data\nneeds. However, traditional methods of analysis are not ad-\nequate when it comes to assigning treatment effects to the\ndrugs taken by patients when there is a tendency for them\nto switch their medication frequently. We have proposed the\nepoch analysis to address this issue. The approach is flexible\nenough to incorporate current methods to address the mod-\neling of skewed cost data, sampling, and decision-making\nuncertainty.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nFrank Windmeijer, PhD (f.windmeijer@bristol.ac.uk), De-\npartment of Economics, University of Bristol, 8 Woodland\nRoad, Bristol BS8 1TN , UK\nStathis Kontodimas, MSc (kontodimas_stathis@lilly.com),\nSenior Health Economist, European Health Outcomes Re-\nsearch, Eli Lilly and Company, Erl Wood Manor, Sunninghill\nRoad, Windlesham, Surrey GU20 6PH, UK\nMartin Knapp, PhD (m.knapp@LSE.ac.uk), Professor of\nSocial Policy, Personal Social Services Research Unit,\nLondon School of Economics & Political Science, Houghton\nStreet, London WC2A 2AE, UK\nJacqueline Brown, PhD (jackie.brown@lilly.com), CNS\nTeam Leader, European Health Outcomes Research, Eli\nLilly and Company, Erl Wood Manor, Sunninghill Road,\nWindlesham, Surrey GU20 6PH, UK\nJosep Maria Haro, PhD (jmharo@comb.es) Director, Sant\nJoan de De\u00b4u \u2013 Mental Health Services, Fundacio\u00b4 Sant Joan\nde De\u00b4u, Dr. Antoni Pujades, 42, Sant Boi de Llobregat\n(Barcelona) 08830, Spain.\nREFERENCES\n1.
