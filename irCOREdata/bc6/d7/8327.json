Commonly, in earthquake engineering practice, the attention is focused on the time \nvariability component and its effects on the structural response. On the other hand, it is well known \nthat the spatial variability of earthquake ground motion can influence significantly the response of \nstructures, especially if they are long and\/or rigid. In this context, a number of contributions has \nbeen devoted to the study of the effects of spatial variability on various structures including \nbuildings [1-4], bridges [5-8], arcs [9,10], dams [11], rigid foundations [12,13], pipelines [14,15], \ntransmission lines [16], and nuclear power plants [17]. Readers could also refer to the monograph \nby Zerva [18] for an overview of the engineering applications in which ground motion spatial \nvariability has been taken into account. The phenomenon of ground motion spatial variability is \naffected by several factors, i.e. source patterns, path, site effects, etc., that generally cannot be \ndescribed in a deterministic fashion. Consequently, only a probabilistic approach can provide a \nrigorous representation of the spatial variability of earthquake ground motion. As a consequence, \nthe computation of structural response is a challenging task for which both ground motion time and \nspatial variability have to be taken into account. Different strategies have been proposed in the last \n2-3 decades for predicting the pertinent structural response. Response spectrum based techniques \n[19-21] are certainly the simplest ones. These methods are very attractive for design purposes due to \ntheir simplicity, but can become inaccurate, especially in the case of nonlinearly behaving \nstructures. Analytical approaches [22,23] based on random vibration theory have captured the \nattention of researchers and practitioners due to their rigorous mathematical basis and their \nefficiency in the case of linear\/linearized structures. However, such analytical approaches are not \n 3 \ncommonly used in practice and possess the limitation to be difficult to apply in the presence of \nstrong nonlinearities. To date, Monte Carlo simulation techniques still remain the only universal \nmethod of analysis when strong nonlinearities as well as input uncertainties are involved. In this \nregard, the accurate simulation of ground motion time histories is the first step in the analysis of the \neffects of both time and spatial variability of earthquake ground motion. To accomplish this \nobjective, various simulation techniques have been proposed for generating ground motion time \nhistories taking into account spatial variability [24-36]. Readers could refer to the monograph by \nZerva [18] for an in-depth discussion of the state of the art along with the challenges involved in \nmodelling the spatial variability of earthquake ground motion. Spectral-representation-based \nsimulation techniques [27,28,37,38] are among the most widely-used today for this purpose. \nAccordingly, earthquake ground motion is modelled as a Gaussian, non-stationary, multi-variate \nvector process, fully defined by its evolutionary cross-spectral density matrix. Spatial variability can \nbe described by the off-diagonal elements of this matrix through coherence functions and apparent \nvelocity of wave propagation.  \nInterestingly, various international seismic codes allow the use of simulated ground motion time-\nhistories for the seismic design of structures. For this purpose, the simulated time-histories have to \nbe spectrum-compatible, i.e. the average response spectrum computed using simulated time \nhistories has to match the target response spectrum provided by the code over a fixed frequency \nrange and with a code-specified tolerance. This means that the simulated ground motion time \nhistories have to be non-stationary in time, spatially variable in space, and spectrum-compatible. \nThe number of contributions devoted to the simulation of spectrum-compatible, uni-variate, ground \nmotions time histories is significant. However, relatively few contributions have considered the case \nof multi-variate (vector) processes accounting for spatial variability. Hao et al. [39] proposed a \nmethod that adjusts independently simulated quasi-stationary time histories in order to make them \ncompatible with the prescribed response spectrum. This adjustment is performed by Fourier \ntransforming each time history to the frequency domain, multiplying its frequency domain Fourier \n 4 \ntransform by the ratio of the prescribed response spectrum over the computed response spectrum of \nthe non-stationary time history, and then inverse transforming the product back to the time domain. \nDeodatis [38] proposed a methodology for generating quasi-stationary spectrum-compatible ground \nmotion vector processes starting from the generation of ergodic, stationary time histories that are \ncompatible with a coherence function and a velocity of wave propagation but not with the \nprescribed response spectrum. After modulating the generated time histories, the matching of the \nresponse spectra is achieved by the successive upgrading of the power spectral density functions of \nthe components of the vector process.  \nIt is well known that the dynamic response of nonlinear structures is highly influenced by the non-\nstationary behaviour of the input [40-42]. Consequently, for a more reliable representation of the \nseismic structural response, both the amplitude and frequency variation of ground motion time \nhistories have to be accounted for. This can be achieved using the concept of evolutionary power \nspectra [43]. According to evolutionary power spectrum theory, in such a case involving so-called \namplitude and frequency modulation, the elements of the cross-spectral density matrix have to be \nnon-separable functions of both frequency and time.  Recently, Sarkar and Gupta [44] proposed an \niterative methodology for generating fully non-stationary spectrum-compatible vector processes \nusing a wavelet-based approach (it should be noted that \u201cfully non-stationary\u201d stands for a non-\nstationary process with amplitude and frequency variation in time, while \u201cquasi-stationary\u201d stands \nfor a non-stationary process with only amplitude variation in time). The method assumes that a \nsuitable accelerogram conforming to the local source and site condition is available. Furthermore, \nthe accelerogram is modified so as to be spectrum-compatible to a design response spectrum, \nassumed the same for each free-field location.  \nIn this paper, a novel methodology for generating fully non-stationary, spectrum-compatible, \nground motion vector processes is proposed. The methodology considers that the ground motion \nvector process is modelled as the superposition of two contributions: the first one is a known fully \nnon-stationary component modelled as a non-separable m-variate non-stationary stochastic process \n 5 \nrepresentative of local geological and seismological conditions. The second one is a corrective term \nmodeled by an m-variate quasi-stationary non-stationary process. The cross-spectral density matrix \nof the corrective term is determined extending the procedure proposed by Cacciola [45] for scalar \nprocesses to the case of vector processes. After determining the evolutionary cross-spectral density \nmatrix of the vector process resulting from the aforementioned superposition, ground motion \nsample functions at different locations compatible with prescribed response spectra and preserving a \ngiven coherence function are generated using the procedure proposed by Deodatis [38]. It has to be \nemphasized that the simulated time histories do not require any iterations for matching the \nprescribed response spectra.  \n \n \n2  m-VARIATE NON-STATIONARY STOCHASTIC GROUND MOTION PROCESSES  \n \nFollowing the spectral-representation methodology (e.g. Shinozuka and Deodatis [27]), consider the \n1D-mV (one-dimensional, m-variate) non-stationary ground motion stochastic vector process, \nwhose components 0 ( ), ( 1,..., )jf t j m=  have zero mean: \n0 ( ) 0, ( 1,..., )jE f t j m\uf8ee \uf8f9 = =\uf8f0 \uf8fb    (1) \ncross-correlation matrix given by: \n0 0 0\n11 12 1\n0 0 0\n0 21 22 2\n0 0 0\n1 2\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n( , ) ,\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\nm\nm\nf\nm m mm\nR t t R t t R t t\nR t t R t t R t t\nt t\nR t t R t t R t t\n\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4\n\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4\n\uf8ee \uf8f9+ + +\n\uf8ef \uf8fa+ + +\uf8ef \uf8fa+ =\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n+ + +\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8f0 \uf8fb\nR\n\uf04c\n\uf04c\n\uf04d \uf04d \uf04f \uf04d\n\uf04c\n   (2) \nand corresponding cross-spectral density matrix with evolutionary power spectrum given by [43]: \n 6 \n0 0 0\n11 12 1\n0 0 0\n0 21 22 2\n0 0 0\n1 2\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n( , )\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\nm\nm\nf\nm m mm\nS t S t S t\nS t S t S t\nt\nS t S t S t\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa=\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8f0 \uf8fb\nS\n\uf04c\n\uf04c\n\uf04d \uf04d \uf04f \uf04d\n\uf04c\n   (3) \nDue to the non-stationarity of the vector process, the cross-correlation matrix is a function of both \ntime t  and time lag \u03c4 , while the cross-spectral density matrix is a function of both frequency \u03c9  \nand time t .

PROPOSED APPROACH FOR GENERATING FULLY NON-STATIONARY SPECTRUM-\nCOMPATIBLE  GROUND MOTION VECTOR PROCESSES \nThe elastic response spectrum approach is the most commonly used method to design structures \nagainst seismic action according to various international codes. Alternatively, \u201cappropriate \nsimulated\u201d ground motion time-histories can be used for seismic design applications [46], [47]. For \nthis purpose, the simulated time-histories have to be spectrum-compatible, i.e. the average response \nspectrum computed using simulated time histories has to match the target response spectrum \nprovided by the code over a fixed frequency range and with a code-specified tolerance. That is: \n( ) ( ) , ( 1,..., )\n( )\nj(f )(j)\nl u(j)\nRSA RSA j m\nRSA\n\u03c9 \u03c9\n\u03b5 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u2212\n\u2264 \u2200 \u2264 \u2264 =      (19) \nwhere ( )(j)RSA \u03c9  is the j-th target response spectrum, ( )j(f )RSA \u03c9  is the j-th ensemble-averaged \nresponse spectrum of the simulated ground motion vector process  ( ), 1, 2,...,jf t j m=  and \u03b5  is a \ncode-specified tolerance, commonly defined as a constant value (and not a function of frequency). \nNote that seismic codes impose only the value of the tolerance \u03b5  and of the bounds l\u03c9  and u\u03c9 . No \nspecific methodology is suggested to simulate the spectrum-compatible accelerograms (see e.g. \n[46,47]).  \n      A spectral representation based approach will be used here for generating fully non-stationary \nspectrum-compatible ground motion vector processes. It should be mentioned that simulated ground \nmotion time-histories are generally criticized for failing to rigorously describe the physical \ncharacteristics of strong ground motion. This is due to the fact that the non-stationary waveforms of \nthe actual seismic time histories are strongly influenced by several factors (such as the seismic \nsource rupture pattern, inhomogeneities in the soil mass, etc.) that are not fully accounted for in the \nsimulation process. To overcome this drawback, the non-stationary as well as the spatial variability \nfeatures of simulated ground motion should be selected so as to reflect local geological and \nseismological conditions. This can be achieved by using recorded local accelerograms. The problem \n 10 \nis that recorded accelerograms are not in general spectrum-compatible.  To address this problem, \nthe main idea of this work is that the non-stationary spectrum-compatible ground motion vector \nprocess is given by the superposition of two contributions: the first one is a fully non-stationary \nvector process ( ), ( 1,..., )Ljf t j m=  with known non-separable cross-spectral density matrix \nrepresentative of geological and seismological conditions at the site; while the second one is a \nquasi-stationary vector process ( ), ( 1,..., )Cjf t j m=  with unknown cross-spectral density matrix, \nwhose objective is to correct each component of ( ), ( 1,..., )Ljf t j m=  in order to make them \nspectrum-compatible. That is: \n( ) ( ) ( ), ( 1, 2,..., )SC L Cj j jf t f t f t j m= + =    (20) \nwhere superscript \u201cL\u201d stands for \u201clocal\u201d (to emphasize that the first term reflects non-stationarity \nand spatial variability pertinent to the site where the ground motion is modelled); superscript \u201cC\u201d \nstands for \u201ccorrective\u201d (to emphasize that the second term is devoted to adjust the process \n( ), ( 1,..., )Ljf t j m=  to make it spectrum-compatible), and the superscript \u201cSC\u201d stands for  \n\u201cspectrum-compatible\u201d . The non-stationary characteristics of the simulated ground motion vector \nprocess \u2013 as well as of its spatial variability \u2013 are taken into account through a pertinent \nrepresentation of vector process ( ), ( 1,..., )Ljf t j m=  that can be pursued using various approaches \n(see e.g. [38], [40]). The spectrum-compatible condition imposed by the seismic code is satisfied \nthrough an appropriate definition of the corrective process ( ), ( 1,..., )Cjf t j m=  that has to be \ndetermined so as to preserve the main features of vector process ( ), ( 1,..., )Ljf t j m= . \nAccordingly, it is assumed that ( ), ( 1,..., )Cjf t j m=  is a quasi-stationary process with \nevolutionary power spectral density for each individual component given by: \n2( , ) ( ) ( ) , ( 1, 2,..., )C Cj j jS t t S j m\u03c9 \u03d5 \u03c9= =     (21) \n 11 \nwhere ( )j t\u03d5  is the j-th modulating function determined so as to preserve the amplitude time \nvariability of process ( )Ljf t [45], while ( )\nC\njS \u03c9  is the j-th (stationary) power spectral density of the \ncorrective process that needs to be determined.  \nTaking into account now eq. (20), the response spectra ( ) ( )\nSC\njfRSA \u03c9 , ( 1,..., )j m=  can be \napproximately determined, in analogy with the \u201csquare root of sum of squares\u201d (SRSS) modal \ncombination rule proposed by Rosenblueth [48], by the following equation: \n2 2\n( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )\nSC L C\nj j jf f fRSA RSA RSA\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\uf8ee \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8f9= +\uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8ef \uf8fa\uf8f0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 \uf8fb      , ( 1, 2,..., )j m=    (22) \nIn eq (22) ( ) ( )\nL\njfRSA \u03c9  and ( ) ( )\nC\njfRSA \u03c9  are the response spectra of the j-th component of processes \n( )Ljf t  and ( ), ( 1,..., )\nC\njf t j m= , respectively. Considering that eq. (20) involves stochastic \nprocesses, eq. (22) should be interpreted here in an ensemble average sense. This means that it is an \nensemble-averaged ( ) ( )\nSC\njfRSA \u03c9  that is supposed to match the target response spectra ( ) ( )jRSA \u03c9 ; \n1, 2,...,j m=  prescribed by the seismic code.  \nThe basic idea of the paper can now be summarized as follows: ( ) ( )\nC\njfRSA \u03c9  in eq. (22) can be \ncomputed as ( ) ( )\nSC\njfRSA \u03c9  and ( ) ( )\nL\njfRSA \u03c9  are known ( ( ) ( )\nSC\njfRSA \u03c9  is supposed to be equal to \n( ) ( )jRSA \u03c9  and ( ) ( )\nL\njfRSA \u03c9  can be estimated as ( )Ljf t  is known). The probabilistic characteristics \nof ( )Cjf t  can be computed from \n( ) ( )\nC\njfRSA \u03c9 ; 1, 2,...,j m= . The aforementioned basic idea is \ndescribed in some detail in the following.

The \nproposed methodology is also summarized in flow-chart form in Figure 1. \nThe methodology proposed in this paper (outlined in Fig. 1) to simulate fully non-stationary \nground motion time histories at a number of locations on the ground surface that reflect a prescribed \ncoherence function and are compatible with prescribed response spectra does not require any \niterations on the individual generated sample functions. This is probably the most important \nadvantage\/innovation of the proposed methodology as Gaussianity and coherence structure of every \ngenerated sample vector process are guaranteed. It is known that if iterations are involved with the \ngeneration of sample functions, Gaussianity and coherence structure deteriorate (e.g. Deodatis and \nMicaletti [50]), unless the iterations are random in nature (e.g. Bocchini and Deodatis [51]). \nHowever, in the latter case, the computational cost increases drastically. \n5 NUMERICAL EXAMPLES  \nIn this section, the proposed methodology for generating fully non-stationary and spectrum-\ncompatible ground motion vector processes is demonstrated with a numerical example. For this \npurpose, consider the configuration of points depicted in Figure 2, representing three different \n 15 \nlocations where fully non-stationary ground motion time histories compatible with three different \nresponse spectra defined by Eurocode 8 [47] have to be simulated. Specifically, point 1 corresponds \nto type A soil (rock or other rock-like geological formation), point 2 corresponds to type B soil \n(deposits of very dense sand, gravel, or very stiff clay), while point 3 corresponds to type D soil \n(deposits of loose-to-medium cohesionless soil or of predominantly soft-to-firm cohesive soil).  \nFurthermore, the maximum ground acceleration ga  has been set equal to 0.35g  for each location. \nAccording to the proposed methodology, the 1D-3V (one dimensional, tri-variate), non-stationary, \nzero-mean, Gaussian stochastic vector process ( )L tf  having evolutionary cross-spectral density \nmatrix: \n11 12 13\n21 22 23\n31 32 33\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n( , ) ( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\nL L L\nL L L L\nL L L\nS t S t S t\nt S t S t S t\nS t S t S t\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n= \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\nS    (33) \nhas to be defined first.

(26) and (27). The Jennings, Housner and Tsai model [53] is \nselected for the modulating function of the corrective term (refer to eq.

It follows that 2 1 11.05ST t t s= \u2212 =  satisfies \nthe limit imposed by the code ( 10ST s\u2265 ) [47].  \nThe evolutionary and spectrum-compatible cross-spectral density matrix is then evaluated using \nequation (32). Its diagonal elements, along with the scaled ( , )LjjS t\u03c9  and ( , ); 1, 2,3\nC\njS t j\u03c9 = , are \nplotted in Figure 6. Then, fully non-stationary spectrum-compatible earthquakes are generated using \neq. (16). A typical sample for each component is provided in Figure 7. A comparison of the \nensemble-averaged simulated response spectra (using 100 samples) with the target ones confirms \nthe effectiveness of the proposed methodology (Figure 8). Figure 9 compares the ensemble-\naveraged coherence functions obtained from 10,000 simulated sample functions with the prescribed \nones defined in equation (36), indicating an excellent agreement (the estimation of the coherence \nfunction from sample time histories is notoriously difficult (e.g. Zerva 2009) and consequently a \nmuch larger number of sample functions is used when compared to the estimation of the response \nspectra). Finally, Figure 10 plots on normal probability paper the empirical probability distribution \nfunctions of generated sample functions at time instant 5t s=  using 10,000 samples. The agreement \nwith the Gaussian distribution is excellent (10,000 samples are considered roughly necessary to \nestimate the probability distribution reasonably well).  \n6 CONCLUDING REMARKS \nIn this paper, a spectral-representation-based methodology has been proposed for generating sample \nfunctions of fully non-stationary and spectrum-compatible ground motion time histories at a number \nof locations on the ground surface that reflect prescribed coherence functions. The basic idea of the \nmethodology considers that the stochastic vector process modelling ground motion is constructed \n 19 \nby the superposition of two components: the first is an evolutionary non-stationary stochastic vector \nprocess with amplitude and frequency modulation, representative of local geological and \nseismological conditions. The second one is a corrective term modelled by a quasi-stationary \nstochastic vector process (a non stationary process with only amplitude modulation) that adjusts the \nresponse spectra of the overall vector process to make them response spectrum-compatible. The \nproposed methodology is not requiring any iteration on the individual generated sample functions, \nthus preserving the Gaussianity and coherence structure of every generated sample vector process. \nThe methodology has also the advantage of providing the fully non-stationary and spectrum-\ncompatible cross spectral density matrix of the ground motion time histories that can be used for \nreliability studies in an analytic stochastic fashion.  \n 20 \nREFERENCES \n[1] Hao, H. and Duan, X.
