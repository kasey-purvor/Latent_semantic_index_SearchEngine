This study investigated how dreams unfold beyond this age period, \nby exploring: (a) the transition period from adolescence to adulthood (17-22 years); \nand (b) the \u201cage thirty\u201d transition period (28-33 years). The sample (140 men and 140 \nwomen) formed two age-based groups with 140 participants in each group. The \nyounger group were found to have developed more grand dreams for the future \ncompared to the older group. Women more than men foresaw the need to juggle their \ndreams, such as relationships, children and a career. Furthermore, a particular type of \nwoman was identified, who was named here as the \u2018superwoman\u2019. These women \ntypically found in the younger age group, wanted to find the perfect partner, have \nchildren, and become very successful in their careers, as well there was little time for \nleisure in these women\u2019s narratives. \n \nKey Words: hopes; dreams; goals; future lives; superwoman; story writing \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 2 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe literature on hopes and dreams has focused mainly on how adolescents, \nparticularly those in their mid-teens, have perceived their future lives (e.g., Gillies, \n1989; Greene, 1986; Greene & Wheatley, 1992; Nurmi, Poole, & Seginer, 1995; \nSeginer, 1992; Trommsdorff, Lamm, & Schmidt, 1979). The reason for this focus is \nhas been because adolescence is generally understood to be a period where people \nbegin to make important decisions about their futures, such as career, marriage, and \nhaving a family. However, researchers have not addressed the question of what \nhappens to these hopes and dreams after adolescence. Do individuals continue to \nconstruct possible worlds for themselves after their mid-teens, or do people simply \nbegin to live the life story that we constructed during adolescence? \nResearchers have found that adolescents\u2019 hopes and goals for the future \nprimarily concern the major developmental tasks they expect to achieve by the end of \ntheir 20s and early 30s. In his review of studies on adolescents\u2019 future orientation and \nplanning, Nurmi (1991) concluded that adolescents are most interested in future \noccupation and education (e.g., M\u00f6nks, 1968; Gillies, 1989; Gillies, Elmwood, & \nHawtin, 1985; Poole & Cooney, 1987; Seginer, 1988). Adolescents' dreams about \noccupation and education have also been evident across cultures (e.g., Mehta, Rohila, \nSunberg, & Tyler 1972; Nurmi et al., 1995). In addition, studies found that \nadolescents become more interested and concerned about their future occupation and \neducation as they grow older (Gillies, 1989; Gillies et al., 1985; Nurmi, 1991; Nurmi, \nPoole, and Kalakoski, 1994; Trommsdorff et al., 1979).  \nThere appear to be mixed results when comparing sex differences for \noccupational hopes and dreams. For example, Lueptow (1984) found no sex \ndifferences in the importance of occupation as a life goal. Similarly, Trommsdorff et \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 3 \n \nal. (1979) found no sex differences for hopes or fears in the occupational domain for \n14-16 year old adolescents. In contrast, Porteus (1979) and Gillies (1989) found that \n14 and 15 year old girls expressed more worries than boys about unemployment. \nThus, the general findings are that girls and boys in their mid-teens find occupation to \nbe an important goal. \nAccording to Nurmi\u2019s (1991) review, the next most popular adolescent dreams \nafter occupation and education, included future family and marriage, leisure activities, \ntravel, and the material aspects of life. Religion, politics, physical wellbeing, self and \npersonality were hopes and concerns also sometimes mentioned by adolescents. It has \nalso been found that family dreams increase in frequency with age. In contrast, it has \nbeen found that adolescents report fewer leisure dreams as they grew older (Nurmi, \n1991). \n \nAims of the Present Study \nThe four main aims of this study were: \n1. To examine the hopes and dreams of individuals in greater detail than in \nprevious studies. Although earlier research provided some information about \nadolescents\u2019 studies on a broad level, researchers typically did not investigate \ndreams on a microlevel. For example, how well do individuals want to do in \ntheir careers, and what types of careers would they most like to enter? \n2. To examine the obstacles that young people believe might impede \nachievement of their dreams. In particular were encouraged to consider how \nthe dreams and obstacles might be linked, in order to elucidate the \ncompromises people make when developing and re-forming their dreams. \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 4 \n \n3. To examine the dreams of individuals beyond adolescence. Given that identity \nis neither determined nor fixed by the end of adolescence (Clausen, 1995; \nMcAdams, 1993), research suggests that there is a need to extend the \nexamination of individuals\u2019 dreams beyond the mid-teens. Therefore, this \nstudy attempted to yield a better understanding of older adolescents\u2019 and \nyoung adults\u2019 dreams for their future. The two age groups examined were \nchosen because they were both nominated by Levinson (1978a, 1978b, 1996) \nas transition periods: the early adult transition period (17 years to 22 years), \nwhen dreams are being formed; and the age-thirty transition period (28 years \nto 33 years), when they are re-formed. \n4. To explore gender differences. Past research has found some difference in the \nhopes and dreams of males and females. For example, Roberts and Newton\u2019s \n(1987) review of four unpublished dissertations based on Levinson\u2019s theory \nfound that, unlike those of men, women\u2019s dreams were usually split between \noccupational and interpersonal goals. Other studies of adolescents\u2019 dreams \nhave found that boys tended to be more interested in material dreams, whereas \ngirls were more interested in dreams relating to future family (Nurmi, 1991). \nAccordingly, this paper explicitly examined gender differences in young \nadults\u2019 dreams and obstacles to these dreams.  \n   \n \nMETHOD \nParticipants \nFirst year psychology students from two universities participated in this study. One \nuniversity was located in a higher socio-economic area (Macquarie University), while \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 5 \n \nthe other was located in the outer suburbs of Sydney, in a lower socio-economic area \n(University of Western Sydney Nepean). There were 50 respondents from each of the \nuniversities. Other groups who participated included: students\u2019 friends (38); two \nChristian groups (14); and people attending two of Sydney\u2019s markets (one in the inner \ncity, and the other located in the outskirts of Sydney, with 64 participants from each \nmarket). \nThe sample consisted of 140 men and 140 women. They formed two age-\nbased groups with 140 participants in each group: one group of 17-22 year olds (M = \n19.0, SD = 1.61), and a second group of 28-33 year olds (M  = 29.9, SD  = 2.02). \nIn considering the highest level of education achieved by this sample, 3% had \nachieved a high school education, 9% had a school certificate, 5% had technical \nqualifications, 54% had completed the higher school certificate (year 12), 23% had a \ndegree or diploma, and 7% had achieved postgraduate qualifications. Although this \nsample is a little skewed in the direction of higher educated, when compared with the \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (1997) data it was considered to be a reasonable \nrepresentation of the Australian population. In May 1997 (close to the time this \nsample was obtained), the ABS reported that of 15-34 year olds, 46.0% had not \ncompleted the Higher School Certificate, 32.3% had completed the higher school \ncertificate, 21.7% had post-school qualifications. However, it should be noted that \n24.9% of the ABS population (considering it begins at 15 years) were still at school. \nTaking into account that the age groups are somewhat different, with more people \nexpected to be at school in the ABS population, the sample appears to be fairly \nrepresentative. \nAlthough the present sample was more skewed toward professionals and \nintermediate clerical workers, salespeople, and personal-service workers, the sample \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 6 \n \nwas considerably younger than the total employed population. As an alternative \nmeasure of social-class status, the educational level of participants\u2019 parents was also \ntaken into account, and for those participants who were employed, type of occupation \nwas considered. Once again, it appeared that this sample is skewed toward \nprofessionals and managers, suggesting that we need to treat the final results with \nsome caution. \nFinally, 89% of the sample were born in Australia, another 2.5% came from \nEnglish speaking countries, and 9% came from non-English speaking countries. \n \nInstrument \nParticipants first completed a short questionnaire asking for their demographic details. \nThey were then asked to write a story about how they would like to see themselves in \n10 years time. They were given 1 hour to complete the task, although most \nparticipants took about 40 minutes to write their stories. The instructions were as \nfollows: \n \nWrite a story about how you would like to see yourself in the next 10 years. Write the \nstory in the third person. Include as much detail as possible and particularly avoid \ncensoring details that seem irrelevant. Avoid psychological interpretation. Include \nany obstacles that get in the way of achieving your dreams\/goals. Produce the most \nvivid story about how you will achieve your dreams\/goals. \n \nWriting in the third person has been encouraged by some researchers as it \nallows the person to have a \u2018bird\u2019s eye view\u2019 of their lives (Crawford, Kippax, Onyx, \nGault, Benton, 1992; Haug, 1987). As Crawford et al. (1992) have said, \u201cthe subject \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 7 \n \nreflects on herself\/himself from the observer, and so is encouraged to describe rather \nthan warrant\u201d (p. 47). The instructions of including as much detail as possible were \ngiven to avoid the possibility that the subject might only include details that they \nthought the researcher desired or expected. Participants were also specifically asked to \navoid using psychological interpretation, so that they would not attempt to evaluate \ntheir lives and actions. \nRESULTS \nContent Analysis \nA content analysis was carried out to clarify the number and types of dreams and \nimpediments included in their stories. This analysis focused on the content of the \nstories. It provided text units, which were then quantified. An initial reading indicated \nthe presence of many of the themes revealed in past studies (e.g., occupation, \nmarriage, having children, and financial dreams). However, the overriding impression \nwas the complexity of the interwoven identities. It became a challenge to code the \nstories without sacrificing too much of their richness. In line with the narrative stance \nto psychology (e.g., Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach, & Zilber, 1998), it was considered a \nnecessity to document as many of the themes as possible, even if only a few of the \nparticipants mentioned them. \nTo check reliability of the coding procedure, a trained scorer recoded 10% of \nthe data. Inter-coder reliability was high, ranging from Kappa 0.75 - 1.00. As the two \nmajor aims of this paper were to determine any differences between men's and \nwomen\u2019s dreams, and older adolescents\u2019 and young adults\u2019 dreams, age and gender \nwere the two independent variables included in the analysis. Logistic regression was \nused to analyse the data. Initial analyses for the main categories of dreams \n(occupation, finance, family, marriage, friends, children, leisure, travel, religion and \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 8 \n \npolitics) included the independent variables and their interactions. The word count for \neach story was also included as a variable in the original analysis. However, it was \nfound to be insignificant in each case and was, therefore, excluded in the final model. \nThe same variables were also used in the analysis of the sub-categories. If the \ninteraction was significant, tests of simple effects were carried out, using a p value of \n0.025. If there were any empty cells, the Pearson Chi-square was used to test for \nsimple effects. Significance for the variables age and gender were taken to be at a p \nvalue of 0.05 or less. \n \nThe Main Dreams and Obstacles \nThe most frequently mentioned dreams were occupational (94.3%), financial (73.6%), \nromantic (72.5%), and children (59.3%). Other dreams included: travel (54.3%), \nleisure\/hobbies (36.4%), friendships (29.3%), parents\/siblings (16.8%), \nreligion\/spiritual (11.1%), and political beliefs (8.2%). In terms of total number of \ndreams mentioned no significant differences were found between age and gender; F \n(3, 277) = 0.98; p = .40. There were fewer obstacles mentioned than dreams. \nTherefore, rather than examining the obstacles separately, they were included as sub-\nthemes of the main dreams. The following section sets out the main dreams and the \nsignificant sub-themes. \n \nOccupation \nA large percentage of the sample (94.3%) mentioned an occupational dream. \nThere were no significant age or gender differences for occupation overall. However, \nthere were many significant differences found for sub-themes of occupation. Only \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 9 \n \n51.1% of participants mentioned obstacles to their careers. Table 1 outlines the \nsignificant sub-themes for occupation. \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE \n \nFinancial \nSeventy-four percent of the sample included a financial or money dream in \ntheir stories. Financial dreams were often linked to occupation. There were no age or \ngender differences for people who included financial dreams in their stories. \nHowever, there were some significant differences in financial sub-themes (Table 2).  \n \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE \n \nRomantic relationships \nTable 3 presents romantic relationships and its sub-themes. It was found that \nmore women (80.7%) than men (78.6%) wrote about being either married or in a de \nfacto relationship, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 9.41, p < .01. Moreover, more older participants \n(78.6%) than younger (66.4%) wrote about being married or in a de facto relationship, \n\u03c72 (1, N =280) = 5.28, p < .05. There were also a number of age and gender \ndifferences revealed for the sub-themes. \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE \n \n \nChildren \nWomen (72.9%) wrote more often than the men (45.7%) about wanting \nchildren or caring for their current children in the future, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 20.71, p < \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 10 \n \n.001, the ideal age to have children, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 12.27, p < .001, and to balance \ntravel and having children, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 6.45, p < .01. \n \nTravel \nFifty-four percent of the participants wrote about wanting to travel. Some \nparticipants wrote about their hopes to travel with a partner, while others wanted to \ntravel to gain experience. Some hoped to travel before they had their children or \nbefore they decided to marry. Money was the only impediment to travel. No age or \ngender differences were found for travel. \n \nLeisure \n \nAn age by gender interaction was found for leisure, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 9.00, p < \n.01. The younger women (10.0%) stood out as mentioning leisure dreams far less than \nthe other three groups (45.2%). The simple effects tests showed that the younger men, \nscored significantly higher than the younger women, \u03c72 (1, N =140) = 25.14, p < .001; \nthe older women scored significantly higher than the younger women, \u03c72 (1, N =140) \n= 15.54, p < .001, and the older men scored higher on this category, in comparison to \nthe younger women, \u03c72 (1, N =140) = 25.14, p < .001. \n It was also clear that the younger women (2.9%) mentioned far fewer outdoor \nactivities than the other three groups (24.8%). The simple effects tests revealed that \nthe older women scored significantly higher than the younger women, \u03c72 (1, N =140) \n= 6.87, p < .01, and the younger men (31.4%) scored significantly higher on this \ntheme compared to the younger women, \u03c72 (1, N =140) = 20.11, p < .001. \nFurthermore, the younger women (1.4%) did not mention spending leisure \ntime with their partner as much as the other three groups (9.5%). Tests of simple \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 11 \n \neffects suggested that the older women scored significantly higher than the younger \nwomen on this sub-theme, \u03c72 (1, N =140) = 6.89, p < .01. The older group wrote more \nthan the younger group that they wanted to relax in 10 years time, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = \n9.67, p < .05. \n \nFriendships \nThere were no significant age or gender differences for friendship overall. \nHowever, it was found that women scored higher than men on giving or receiving \nsupport from friends, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 4.63, p < .05, while men mentioned more than \nwomen that they would go out with their friends in 10 years time, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = \n4.56, p < .05. \n \nParents\/siblings \nA small number of respondents (16.7%) mentioned their relationships with \nparents and siblings in 10 years time. Women included this theme in their stories \nmore than the men, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 8.76, p < .001. The only sub-theme for parents or \nsiblings was the desire to be close to one\u2019s parents and siblings.  \n \nReligion \nEleven percent of the participants wrote about having religious or spiritual \ndreams in 10 years times. No significant age or gender differences were found for \nreligious dreams or its sub-theme to become more spiritual. \n \nPolitics \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 12 \n \nEight percent of the participants wrote about having political beliefs or dreams \nin 10 years time. The younger group mentioned more political themes than the older \ngroup, \u03c72 (1, N =280) = 7.05, p < .01. There were no sub-themes for political dreams. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThis current research demonstrates the importance of going beyond the broad \ncategories outlined in past hopes and dreams studies, to reveal the micro aspects of \nthe dream. For example, there were no significant age or gender differences obtained \nfor an occupational dream. However, differences were found for wanting a glamorous \njob, a high paying job, work that will benefit society, and a job that involves caring \nfor others. Nevertheless, similar broad categories for dreams found in past research \nwere also revealed in this study. For example, occupation and romantic relationships \nwere the most frequently mentioned dreams. This is congruous with past research \n(e.g., Nurmi, 1991).  \n \nGrand dreams \nThis study further revealed that some 17-22 year olds were developing heroic \nstories about themselves, and thus described many grandiose dreams for the future. \nCompared with the older participants, the younger participants were more inclined to \nwrite personal narratives that contained fairly extraordinary dreams. To give some \nexamples from extracts from the stories: \n \n\u201cWhile concentrating on her career, she has also managed to maintain a steady \nrelationship with her boyfriend of 2 [sic] years, actor (...). The couple receive a lot of \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 13 \n \nmedia attention due to (...) acting ability and her personal achievements in making \nchannel 9...\u201d (18 year old female). \n \n\u201cShe would go to London and become that rock star Yelp! That life style \ncould suit for awhile. You could just imagine the suicide blonde dreadlocks with \ncolours and wire through them and the skimpy little hipsters just completely decked \nout in rock star clothing\u201d (21 year old female). \n \n\u201cHere he worked tirelessly for a breakthrough that you dream about, towards \nthe cause and cure of cancer\u201d  (18 year old male). \n \nThe unrealistic tone evident in more of the younger group\u2019s stories is in line \nwith Levinson\u2019s concept of the \u2018Dream\u2019. Levinson (1978a) argued that initially the \n\u2018Dream\u2019 is poorly developed and is not necessarily connected with reality. As a \nconsequence it may start by taking a dramatic or unrealistic form. He also argued that \nif the \u2018Dream\u2019 is unrelated to the person\u2019s life structure it will fade away and lose \npurpose, and that the \u2018age thirty transition period\u2019 (28-33 years) is a time when people \nbegin to settle down and a \u2018de-illusioning process\u2019 begins (Levinson, Darrow, Klein, \nLevinson, & McKee, 1976). If the Dream is not well formed it might become \nabandoned or re-worked at this stage. This conceptualisation is supported by the \nyounger groups\u2019 unrealistic ambitions, while the older group are more cognisant of \nthe real opportunities available, together with what real talents they possessed. \nThese results can be further explained by Elkind\u2019s (1974a, 1974b, 1978, \nElkind & Bowen, 1979) notion of the \u2018personal fable\u2019. Elkind argued that adolescents \ngo through a stage where they develop heroic stories about themselves. He considered \nthat lack of experience in the world partly explained adolescents\u2019 egocentricity. This \nidea of the \u2018personal fable\u2019 could explain why more of the younger group in this \npresent study desired a career where they would be famous and acquire great wealth. \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 14 \n \nAlthough Elkind argued that the personal fable is more evident during mid-\nadolescence, it is clear from this study that some older adolescents and young adults \nstill develop narratives that resemble a \u2018personal fable\u2019 (Whitty, 1997, 1998). \n \nConsolidating the dream \nLevinson (1978a) argued that age 28-33 years is a period when one begins the \nprocess of consolidating one\u2019s \u2018Dreams\u2019. This was partly supported in the present \nstudy. The 28-33 year olds were less likely to form dreams that contained lofty ideals: \ncompared to the younger group, they were more likely to write about striving for \nsuccess in their current job, saving money, and providing for their children. In \naddition, the older participants were better able to understand the difficulties involved \nin achieving their dreams. For example, the older group was more concerned that they \nwould not have enough money or time to achieve their occupational dream, and they \nperceived a number of financial obstacles to achieving their dreams.  \n It could, however, be argued that the older groups\u2019 narratives were not solely \nfocused on consolidating the dream. For example, although dreams such as falling in \nlove, marriage and activities for relaxation might be considered as settling down, they \ncould also be understood as new chapters in the life story, rather than consolidation of \nthe dream. \n \nThe split dream \n In addition to these developmental differences, there are some important \ngender differences that need to be addressed. What clearly emerged was that the \nwomen wanted a career just as much as the men. However, the women foresaw that \nachieving this career dream would be more difficult (Whitty, 1997, 1998). These \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 15 \n \nresults are reminiscent of Roberts and Newton\u2019s (1987) theory of the \u2018split dream\u2019 \nand Archer\u2019s (1985) findings that adolescent men have career, marriage, and children \ngoals, but they do not connect these dreams. More women than men wrote that they \nwould have to balance time dedicated to having children and having a career. \nFurthermore, more women than men wrote that they would need to balance time spent \non their relationship with time spent on a career. A few women even wrote that they \nwould give up their career once they were married. \nThe women did not seem to be resentful, and often found these compromises \nto be a desirable outcome. It appears that the women who mention the need to balance \ntheir careers with having children, their relationships, or both, understand this as their \nrole, and instead of complaining about this balancing act they consider practical \ncompromises. For example, more women than men wrote that they hoped to reach the \npinnacle of their career before having children. In this way they could easily return to \nwork in a comfortable position after taking time off to have the children. Other \ncompromises considered by the women included: working part-time once they have \ntheir children; working at home after having children (some thought about setting up a \nbusiness so they could work at home); having some time out of their career to care for \nchildren; leaving work altogether once they have children; or arranging child-care so \nthat they can still work once they have children.  \nThese results suggest that despite the growing strength of the women\u2019s \nmovement in the nineties, women still see themselves as the primary caregivers. It \nseems that women\u2019s desires to have careers, and to be successful in these careers has \nincreased, but these increased opportunities are accompanied by an increase in \nconcerns and obstacles to achievement of occupational dreams. In line with this \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 16 \n \ncommitment to child rearing, it is noteworthy that more women than men wrote that \nthey would like a career that involved caring for others. \n \nThe superwoman \nOne particular type of woman was identified in this research, was the young \nwoman who wants to fit in everything, before she has to take time out to have her \nchildren. I have named this type, the \u2018superwoman\u2019. To give an example: \n \n\u201cWhile maintaining such a high profile and busy career the couple have \ndecided to wed in 6 [sic] months, she doesn\u2019t want to have children in her mid 30\u2019s, \nso she will be looking at taking 6 [sic] months off in 2 [sic] years time, then coming \nstraight into work again\u201d (18 year old female). \n \nMany of the women in this study, particularly in the younger group, wanted to \nachieve success in their careers as well as a fulfilling romantic relationship and having \nchildren. The narrative method utilised highlighted (more than many previous studies) \nhow much the women wanted to achieve. It seems that the women who wanted high \npower careers, promotions and an ideal relationship with children, should be \nunderstood as trying to live out the narrative of the superwoman (Whitty, 1998). \nA few theorists have used this term to describe women. For example, Henry \n(1984) has used the term to describe some of the articles written up in women\u2019s \nmagazines. Henry found that all the magazines she examined contained articles about \nthe \u2018superwoman\u2019, who is able to combine a job and family. Henry argued that these \narticles portray the superwoman as someone to be admired. Other noteworthy \nresearch in this area has been carried out by sociologists (Hoschschild & Machung, \n1989; Machung, 1989), who discussed the strategies that \u2018supermums\u2019 used in order \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 17 \n \nto have a career, a relationship, and have children. They proposed that these women \nworked one shift as pain work, and a \u2018second shift\u2019 at home. \nThe narratives revealed in this current research highlight the problems women \nencounter with constructing their dreams. Being a superwoman requires some \nsacrifices. The lack of leisure themes in many of the younger women\u2019s stories \nsuggests that they must put such luxuries on hold until they can achieve their \noccupation and relationship dreams. Some women decided there would be a point \nwhere they would give up their careers, while others put their relationships and having \nchildren on hold until they had achieved their desired success in their occupations. A \nsense of urgency was present in many of the women\u2019s stories. These women were \naware of the biological and social constraints on them to fit in having children. \nThe narrative of the superwoman has a number of implications for gender \nroles in the nineties. It seems that women in the late nineties are very much aware that \nthey can have success in an occupational dream. In fact recent research conducted \nwithin Australia indicated that, on average, women younger than thirty are earning as \nmuch, if not slightly more (1%) than men of the same age (Mark Wooden, 1999, as \ncited in Martin 1999). However, this current study suggested that women still have \ncommunal dreams such as a having a relationship and a family. They seemed to \nunquestioningly accept the traditional role of caregiver and tried to add or take time \nout of this role to have a career. However, the men seemed satisfied with doing well \nin a career and not having to make too many sacrifices in order to have a relationship \nand a family. Few of the men wrote about any compromises they would have to make \nif their wives or partners wanted to work full-time. Interestingly, Wooden\u2019s research \nfound that women over 30 earned considerably less than men earn. It seems that once \nwomen decide to have children, they either are not able to return to the positions they \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 18 \n \nwere in before they exited the work-force or that they elect to work part-time, or leave \nthe work-force altogether.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nDespite the many strengths of this research, the methodology did had some \nshortcomings. Firstly, some respondents were limited by their written fluency; their \nstories restricted to including what they were capable of expressing on paper. \nSecondly, although it was seen as a strength to exclude prompts about particular \ndreams, this could have been a limitation, as some respondents might have included \nthese dreams had they thought of them.  \n Finally, this study gives further support to the notion that identity is not fully \nachieved by the end of adolescence, but rather is being continually re-structured. The \nclear differences in the age groups\u2019 descriptions of their dreams and impediments to \nthese dreams, suggest that identity formation continues beyond adolescence. \nTherefore, these results call forth the need to study dreams and identity formation \nbeyond adolescence (Whitty, 1997, 1998). The study also demonstrates the \nimportance of considering the development of the dream on a micro level. Such an \napproach allows researchers to understand in more detail the complexity of young \npeople\u2019s dreams of their future lives. \nThe myth of the superwoman \n \n 19 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nArcher, S.
