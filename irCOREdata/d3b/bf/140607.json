This paper \nconsiders the length of the aftercare period required by the municipal solid waste streams that the \nUK will most probably generate following implementation of the Landfill Directive. Data were \nderived from literature to identify properties of residues from the most likely treatment processes \nand the probable management times these residues will require within the landfill environment \nwere then modelled. Results suggest that for chloride the relevant water quality standard (250 mg \n2 \nl-1) will be achieved with a management period of 40 years and for lead (0.1 mg l-1), 240 years. This \nhas considerable implications for the sustainability of landfill and suggests that current timescales \nfor aftercare of landfills may be inadequate. \n \nKeywords: Equilibrium; completion; emissions; MSW \n \nINTRODUCTION \n In this work, presented here as the first of a series of three companion papers, we consider \nthat landfill pollutant removal requirements are intrinsically linked to the concept of \nenvironmental equilibrium. Equilibrium is defined here as that state when emissions from a \nlandfill site occur at a rate that allows sufficient natural attenuation in the surrounding \nenvironment to prevent environmental harm, so management is no longer required. To embody \nthe principles of sustainability, equilibrium can only be achieved when the management period \n(post-closure when the site has ceased accepting waste for disposal, alternatively known as the \naftercare period) is measured in decades rather than centuries. Throughout aftercare, the landfill \nlicence or permit holder is required to take active measures to control pollution from the site. This \ninvolves monitoring, ensuring integrity of management and engineering systems such as leachate, \nlandfill gas and restoration, and if necessary, taking corrective action until such time as licence or \npermit surrender is accepted by the regulator. In the UK, the Pollution Prevention Control (PPC) \nregime [1] requires an estimate of the time taken for a landfill to achieve completion, but guidance \nis lacking. \n \n3 \n When assessing equilibrium there are a number of issues that must be considered. Firstly, it \nis expected that landfill liner performance will diminish with time and therefore the rate of \nleachate or gas leakage may increase. Secondly long-term hydraulic performance of a landfill is \ndependent on the management and control of leachate levels. If a landfill operator ceases to \nmanage their liabilities, financial provisions allow the regulatory authorities to take over \nmanagement of the site. Financial provision is usually restricted to a 30-60 year period. \n \n The setting of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) diversion targets in the EU Landfill \nDirective [2] and the need to pre-treat waste prior to landfilling is bringing about considerable \nchanges to the composition of wastes going to landfill. There are concerns relating to the \nsustainability of landfill in general and there is a growing recognition of the long timescales \nrequired to achieve equilibrium status; there is a possibility that the change in the nature of waste \ngoing to landfill may exacerbate this problem. \n \n In the current study, treated wastes going to landfill were assessed using the number of \nyears to achieve equilibrium status.  A current-day landfill, designed and operated largely in \ncompliance with today\u2019s UK guidelines was used as the benchmark. We have reviewed residue \nflows that can be anticipated from various waste pre-treatment and treatment processes with the \naim of determining the revised properties of the waste residues that are destined for landfill. \nFactors that affect the biodegradable content, particle size or density of the material, or lead to the \nremoval of metals etc. could influence the behaviour, both biological and chemical, of waste \nresidues to an extent that landfill management options might not be the same (or even appropriate) \nfor all waste streams. Ultimately, the success or otherwise of the options studied depend on both \n4 \ntime and cost to achieve equilibrium status. Those techniques or combinations of technology and \nlandfill management that can approach the definition of equilibrium were identified, and the \nability to operate the scheme within the current legislative constraints considered. The waste \nprocesses investigated are shown in Table 1 as variants of mechanical biological treatment (MBT), \nrefuse derived fuel (RDF) and energy from waste (EfW).  \n \n This study has, as a consequence of data shortages, concentrated primarily on the inorganic \ncomponents of leachate.  Beyond understanding the origins of these compounds, little is known of \ntheir mass balance through various waste treatment processes. Data relating to the elemental \ncomposition of MSW is available for the primary fractions (i.e. paper, plastic, textiles, etc.) but we \nfound few data indicating the elemental analyses of the various residues of treatment processes. \nLeachate data provide a means of integrating over a large mass of waste, but provide little insight \ninto the total contaminant mass present where solubility limitations restrict the concentrations of \nsome metals. \nBENCHMARK STUDY: LEACHATE MODELLING \n To provide a benchmark for the comparison of results from this study, leachate modelling \nwas undertaken to determine the equilibrium status of a typical UK landfill designed and operated \non a pre-Landfill Directive basis. The basic scenario was similar to that used for the modelling \nundertaken to support the definition of European Waste Acceptance Criteria [3] and for this we \nutilised a published source term model [3, 4]. Figure 1 shows the basic hydrogeological scenario \nthat forms the basis of the calculations. \n The software used for this work was GoldSim [5], which has a probabilistic visual \nspreadsheet platform capable of transient modelling.  Modifications were made to the basic \n5 \nscenarios in the GoldSim model used for the UK contributions to the setting of the leaching limit \nvalues given in the EU Decision [6] establishing criteria and procedures for the acceptance of waste \nat landfills. These modifications were carried out to reflect the work contained in the latest release \nof LandSim 2.5 [7]. They included the gradual unavoidable degradation of the liner and cap \n(assuming HDPE construction) and the option to simulate the end of managed control (e.g. \nremoving all management controls of leachate levels, recirculation and removal). \n \n In order to provide a framework for the assessment, values were calculated for each species \nfor which a leaching limit value was given in the EU Decision [8] and additionally for ammonium. \nThe point of compliance for the species was the base of the unsaturated zone for List I substances \n[9], the edge of the landfill for List II substances and a point 200 m from the site boundary for \nhighly mobile List II and non-listed substances. For each, a water quality standard or guideline was \napplied. These were either the relevant EU drinking water standard [10] or, where not available, \nthe World Health Organisation drinking water guideline [11]. Also used was a kappa value for \neach species that served to describe the rate of concentration decline, and an appropriate \nindividual contaminant\/subsoil interaction (Kd) value for the liner and geosphere.  Information \nabout kappa and Kd values was taken from Hjelmar et al. (2001). \n  \n The model was run to determine the end of the aftercare period, i.e. when groundwater \nquality at the relevant point of compliance remained below the relevant water quality standard or \nguideline. This is a challenging modelling exercise, as emissions from the landfill are dynamic and \nneed to be below certain emission criteria prior to the management system being switched off. The \nresult of removal of management control will be an increase in leachate levels and a comparable \n6 \nincrease in leakage rate. Hence, shortly after the removal of management control, there will be a \nperiod when the flux of contaminants from the site increases as a result of increased leakage. By \ntreating the period of management control as a variable and running the model with this input \nrepresented as a logarithmic uniform probability distribution function varying between 3 and 2000 \nyears, the appropriate time scale was determined for each contaminant.  \n \nRESULTS - BENCHMARK STUDY \n The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3, which, with Figures 2 and 3, give an insight into the \nmethodology. Achievement of equilibrium status for conventional landfills is likely to be \ncontrolled by a number of key species; chloride, lead, zinc and other metals. That is not to say that \nthese controlling species will remain the same for other landfill types containing residues different \nfrom those in a typical current landfill used as the benchmark. \n \n The benchmarking of a standard landfill showed that many of the contaminants achieve \nequilibrium status, with respect to leakage to groundwater, in a surprisingly short period. In this \nexample, even ammoniacal nitrogen met the criterion within a relatively short period. However, \nother contaminants, notably lead, took a considerable amount of time to reach stabilisation. The \nleachate concentrations used as a starting point in this exercise are taken from the geometric mean \nvalues within LandSim, which in turn are based on published research [12]. \n \n A second scenario was run with the leachate concentrations set to the C0 values prescribed \nfor stable, non reactive hazardous waste going to a non-hazardous landfill. C0 is the initial peak \nconcentration of the contaminant in the leachate (mg l-1) when subject to the standard upflow \n7 \npercolation test [13]. Results were significantly different with most species requiring an aftercare \nperiod in excess of 1000 years and 50% requiring a management period of greater than 2000 years \n(Table 3). \n        \n Figure 2 shows the relationship between receptor concentration and management time for \nchloride for a non-flushing landfill that has accepted predominantly raw MSW. It is clear that the \nrelationship between the length of management time and the reduction of receptor concentrations \nis not linear. \n \nEach point on the graph is the result of modelling a different management period using a \nlogarithmic sampling scale. The relevant water quality standard (WQS) for chloride is 250 mg l-1 \nand this was achieved with a management period of 40 years (Table 2). It must be stressed that the \nleachate chloride concentration at this time (i.e. 1275 mg l-1 at 40 years) would not meet the WQS. \nHowever, the processes of natural attenuation and dilution result in compliance if the management \nof leachate ceases at this time. It must also be stressed that on the cessation of leachate \nmanagement there is an expectation that leachate treatment (or removal) ceases, leachate levels will \nrise, and leakage will increase in line with the increased leachate head. Furthermore, it should be \nnoted that the concentration at the receptor did not reach 250 mg l-1 at 40 years. This maximum \nconcentration occurred at 156 years, some 116 years after the management of the site ceased. \n \n Figure 3 shows a similar relationship for lead. In this case, the aftercare period required to \nreach equilibrium status was approximately 400 years (Table 2). The leachate concentration at this \ntime was 0.12 mg l-1 (twelve times the WQS). The actual time taken for the maximum groundwater \nconcentration to be realised was 4000 years. There is therefore a large disjoint between the time \n8 \nwhen management of leachate could cease and the time when the maximum concentrations in \ngroundwater will be realised. \n \nNATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY RESIDUES \n Almost all municipal waste authorities in the UK are involved with a certain amount of pre-\ntreatment of MSW in the form of separate collection of some recyclables direct from households or \nfrom collection points. Some have increased this basic minimum diversion from landfill with the \naddition of materials recycling facilities (MRF) for more efficient removal of recyclables, or the \nprovision of thermal and biological treatment facilities intended to be significant alternatives to \nlandfill such as incineration or composting. For this study a number of representative treatment \noptions were selected and the effect of these on the timescale for management of the landfilled \nresidues was assessed. \n \n Experience has shown that to achieve BMW reduction rates as high as those set by the \nLandfill Directive requires more than simply providing separate collection of recyclables [14]. \nInevitably, therefore, the residues that will be landfilled in the future will be from a series of \ntechnologies and processes. In terms of process flows or combinations of the different technologies, \na number of recent developments in the UK were reviewed and some UK disposal authorities\u2019 \nearly waste strategies were studied to determine the most likely scenarios.  \n \n Waste sorting splits raw MSW into several waste streams; some of which are typically \nsuitable for recycling. For the purposes of this study, waste sorting was reviewed as an integral \n9 \npart of the wider treatment process, rather than as a stand-alone technology. Consequently, little \nattempt was made to analyse the potential affects of residues obtained solely from waste sorting. \n \nMaterials recovery facilities \n \n Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) are becoming more common throughout the UK and it \nis envisaged that they will remain an integral part of municipal waste recovery processes in the \nUK. Commonly paper, cardboard, plastics and metals suitable for recycling are derived as \nmarketable bailed materials following sorting and separation during MRF operations. Unsorted \nresidues may be disposed of to landfill. MRFs can be categorised into clean and dirty variants. \nClean MRFs process source-segregated material for recovery. Dirty MRFs (Figure 4) are simpler \nforms of MRF, most of which have now been phased out. Dirty MRFs process the entire collected \n(unsorted) waste stream. \n \nMechanical biological treatment \n MBT is a generic term for a range of processes used to treat MSW (normally post source \nsegregation) by means of a combination of mechanical separation and biological treatment. \nAlthough different technologies may be used, they have similar characteristics. These commonly \ncomprise three stages: mechanical size reduction, the driving off of moisture and, finally, material \nseparation to segregate output streams for different purposes. \n \n Figure 4 illustrates the fate of each material extracted from the process. In this study, all the \nsystems involving the elementary steps are referred to as MBT. MBT outputs incorporate selected \n10 \nrecyclable materials and a stabilised waste. Extraction of recyclables occurs both before and after \nbiological processing of the residual waste. \n \n It is widely believed that MBT pre-treatment of waste prior to landfilling reduces landfill \nemissions compared to untreated MSW. It is, however, difficult to track an accurate mass balance \nof trace contaminants through the system.  \n \n During the process there is a reduction in mass which has been mainly attributed to the \ndecrease in water content and the degradation of organic material. Weight reductions typically \nrange between 20% and 40% [15-18]. Volume reductions are thought to be a result of the \nmechanical stage, e.g. shredding. They are reported to be between 35% and 79%, largely depending \non the degree of landfill diversion during the MBT process. Virtually all plants have means of \nremoving ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and many also attempt to remove a reasonable \nproportion of the plastics that enter the process. \n \n MBT residues typically achieve a higher emplaced density within landfills than standard \nMSW. A value of 1.3 t m3 was reported by Binner [19]. Scheelhaase and Bidlingmaier [20] found \nduring lysimeter tests that storage densities of 1.6 t m3 were achievable. They also reported a \nnotable decrease in permeability between feedstocks and MBT residues as a result of the increased \ndensity, high homogeneity, smaller grain sizes and the high proportions of \u2018earthy\u2019 components of \nthe material following MBT procedures. Some authors report hydraulic conductivity ranges from \n<1 x 10-10 m s-1 (<25 mm, 50 weeks treatment) to <1 x 10-11 m s-1 (<12 mm, 5 weeks treatment). \nHowever, a more recent report [21] shows the relationship between MBT residue permeability and \n11 \napplied load. Results range from 3 x 10-5 m s-1 for waste under a load of 50 kN m2 to 6 x 10-9 m s-1 \nwith an applied load of 550 kN m2. These values are almost identical to those derived for raw MSW \nand as such indicate a comparable permeability. Care needs to be taken when comparing the \nresults with raw MSW as the density of the two waste streams will be different. \n \n Comparison of the organic matter content before and after the MBT process (using loss on \nignition data) indicates degradation of between 50 and 70% by weight of organic dried solid \nmatter.  It should be noted that the composition of input material is a key-determining factor. \nFurther intensive composting over a protracted period could reduce the weight of organic material \n(dried solid) to 12% of the original feedstock but this is unusual and would only result from highly \nselective waste streams. In most cases the loss on ignition value drops to 25 - 35 wt. % of organic \ndried solid matter after pre-treatment [20].  \n \n Through landfill simulation experiments, the influence of MBT pre-treatment has been \ncompared to MSW in terms of leachate quality [15]. Available data demonstrate that for pre-treated \nwaste the acidic phase (during which high strength leachate is produced from MSW) does not \noccur. Substantial reductions in long-term concentrations of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and \nTotal Nitrogen (as N) have been reported [22] compared to MSW, although the precise basis of \nthese claims is uncertain. It is clear that leachate strengths are lower, but the composition of the \nnon-degradable (hard) COD is unknown. Data are also available from several small-scale outdoor \nlysimeters which contained MSW and MBT residual wastes, e.g. Kabbe, 2000, reported in Robinson \net al. [18]. Results for heavy metals content from both of these example lysimeters were similar. \n \n12 \n Leaching tests undertaken on samples of MSW and MBT residues, solely for ammonia and \nTOC have been reported [17]. Concentrations of ammoniacal-N were found to be similar for MSW \nand Mechanically Sorted Organic Residues (MSOR) of around 500 mg l-1, but were notably lower \nfor MBT waste, at about 150 mg l-1 [18]. \n \n The quality of MBT waste materials (and hence landfill leachate quality) will vary as a \nconsequence of the extent of source-separation of the waste inputs (urban or rural source, seasonal \ncollections), type of mechanical pre-treatment and type and duration of biological treatment [23]. \nLeachate quality data from full-scale landfill sites are also consistent with the loss of the acetogenic \nstate in MBT waste landfills [19]. This is highlighted by comparatively high pH values during the \nfirst few years. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), COD and ammonium are all reported to be \nconsiderably lower in MBT pre-treated waste than in MSW landfills. The concentrations of some \nheavy metals are also reduced especially zinc, but it is recognised that the solubility of some metals \n(especially zinc) tend to reduce markedly at the onset of methanogenesis. \nFor organic compounds (e.g. mecoprop), evidence suggests that effective composting processes are \nable to reduce the subsequent concentration in the leachate to below those in sites accepting MSW \nand MSOR. In practice, the extent of removal of mecoprop from leachates may be a good surrogate \nmeasure of the efficiency of the composting process itself, to which waste fractions have been \nsubjected. It is noted however that the degree of composting achieved and the efficiency of \nindividual composting processes cannot be determined by the duration of composting. A further \nleachate quality summary for leachates from landfills\/test cells containing untreated MSOR and \nMSOR subjected to various composting regimes was obtained from Bone et al. [23]. \n \n13 \n Robinson et al. report a suggested leachate source term for landfills accepting \npredominantly MBT residues [18]. This represented their best estimate based on an extensive desk \nstudy and independent sampling from a number of European landfill sites.  \n \nMBT\/composting \n Many MBT systems were originally developed as compost plants. The intention was to \nconvert raw MSW into quality compost, but there are few examples where the product has \nachieved the necessary quality, and large quantities are landfilled.  The quality of the compost \nderived from MBT systems varies considerably and is largely dependent upon the quality of input \nmaterial and process retention period. While the residue has been \u201ccomposted\u201d in the process, it \nstill contains some of the contaminants present in the feedstock. The suitability of the resultant \nmaterial for beneficial application is generally limited to low grade uses such as landfill daily \ncover, \u2018brownfield\u2019 restoration or forestry.  \n \n In the context of MSW in the UK, the term composting has usually been taken to mean the \ngreen waste shredding and outdoor windrowing that is undertaken by many municipal \nauthorities. This study assumed that no significant residue from this process would be sent to \nlandfill.  \n \n Changes in the composition of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste during the \nbiodegradation process and the final waste products are strictly dependent on the process \nconditions. The reduction of carbon content due to biodegradation increases with process \ntemperature from 20% at 20\u00b0 C to about 40% at 37\u00b0 - 42\u00b0 C [24]. The fate of heavy metals and non-\n14 \ndegradable species is less certain and they are likely to be unaffected by the process. However, \nwith the volume and mass reduction of the waste the concentration (but not the mass) of these \ncontaminants is likely to increase.  \n \n Organic trace contaminants in conventional MSW include a number of species that are \nresistant to biodegradation in the anaerobic conditions that quickly become established in a \nmodern MSW landfill. Species such as mecoprop, toluene and benzene do not undergo significant \nanaerobic degradation. While volatile species (such as the BTEX compounds) leave the landfill via \nlandfill gas and may be destroyed within combustion plant, non-volatile species such as mecoprop \nwill only be removed by leaching. The removal of these species via aerobic degradation within the \ncomposting process is beneficial, should the material be landfilled. \n \nMBT\/Anaerobic digestion \n The digestion of MSW is not common in the UK. The success of anaerobic digestion of MSW \ndepends upon a high degree of pre-sorting and mechanical separation.  Anaerobic digestion \nreduces organic waste to a relatively stable solid residue similar to compost. The process can be \ncompleted in 2-3 weeks. There is the risk that the digestate will contain high proportions of heavy \nmetals, particularly when treating unsorted waste as demonstrated in Table 4. Anticipating this, it \nis necessary to carefully oversee the feedstock going to the reactor.  The main products from AD \nare biogas, a liquid fraction and a solid residue. No data could be obtained on the mass balance of \ncontaminants. \n \n15 \n Leachate quality data for landfills accepting AD residues are poorly documented. However, \nit is anticipated that leachates from those residues that have not been subjected to a post \ncomposting stage will be of a similar quality to a methanogenic leachate from a typical MSW site \ncontaining moderate levels of ammonia, residual hard COD, chloride concentrations comparable \nwith MSW and the range of heavy metals typically found in MSW leachate. \n \n For those sites that accept AD residues that have been composted following the AD stage, \nleachates are likely to be similar to leachates derived from MBT composted waste that is landfilled. \nLeachate concentrations from one site that had accepted AD composted material are taken from \nRobinson et al. [18]. The leachate was very similar to a methanogenic leachate albeit that the \nammoniacal N concentration was less than 200 mg l-1. There was a low, but detectable, \nconcentration (0.47 \u03bcg l-1) of mecoprop although there was a near absence of other identifiable trace \norganic contaminants. \n \nRefuse derived fuel (RDF) \n RDF (alternatively known as solid recovered fuel or SRF) has different meanings in different \nmember states of the EU. It is well-established in Austria, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands \nand Sweden whilst in Belgium and the UK RDF production is still developing [25]. RDF generally \nencompasses a residue that is produced from waste with the intent of being traded and co-burnt in \ninstallations for power generation or in a manufacturing process where heat is required (e.g. \ncement production). The principal purpose for developing RDF from MSW is to arrive at a dry, \nhigh-calorific value (15->18 MJ\/ kg [26]) product of improved homogeneity compared with raw \nMSW. In some cases, purpose-built incinerators have been developed to receive only RDF from \n16 \nMSW. The European standards organization (CEN) is classifying fuel according to net calorific \nvalue, chlorine and mercury content .  However, the particle size, moisture content and fuel \ncomposition are also important.   \n \n There is a high likelihood that not all RDF will be utilised continuously in co-incineration \nplants. Historically, considerable amounts of RDF have been stored or landfilled for a variety of \nreasons such as lack of demand or poor quality. Hence, this study considered that one potential \nprocess flow will result in RDF being landfilled directly. \n \n The composition of RDF from MSW will vary according to the origin of waste material and \nthe sorting\/separation process. This will in turn greatly influence the properties of RDF such as the \ncalorific value. A typical composition for RDF from MSW originating from the UK is plastic (20%), \npaper\/cardboard (58%), wood (5%), textile (15%), non-combustibles e.g. glass and metals (2%) [26]. \n \n The important characteristics for RDF as a fuel are the calorific value (20-23 MJ\/kg for \nsource-separated MSW; 13 MJ\/kg for mixed MSW), water (10-35%), ash (10-16%), sulphur (0.2%) \nand chlorine (0.3-0.7%) contents [25]. These values are indicative and also vary according to the \nsources, the collection system (mixed or source separated) and the treatment applied (screening, \nsorting, grinding, drying etc.) [25]. RDF tends to affect the concentrations of cadmium, lead, copper \nand zinc when co-incinerated with other material.  No specific information could be obtained on \nleachate quality from landfilling 100% RDF incineration residues.   \n \n17 \n Wet flock-type RDF is prepared by shredding, screening, magnetic separation, eddy current \nseparation and possibly air classification to remove the non-combustible fraction (e.g. ferrous \nmaterials, glass and grit). The output tends to be dry and odour-free, with an enhanced calorific \nvalue, as both the moisture content and non-combustible fraction have been substantially reduced.  \n \n No specific information could be obtained from RDF\/MBT where RDF results from a more \nsophisticated MBT process. However, if the material is incinerated, it is unlikely to differ \nsignificantly from RDF ash. If, because of lack of markets, it is not burnt, then it is likely to be \nsimilar to MBT residues that have been sent to landfill. \n \nMass burn incineration \n In mass burn incineration the volume of waste is reduced by 90% and its weight by 75% \n[27]. Generally up to three different types of waste are produced: bottom ash, fly ash and air \npollution control (APC) residues. Bottom ash arises from high temperature oxidative processes \nacting on the waste. Fly ash is the fine particulate matter (typically 1 to 500 \u03bcm) which is carried \nover from the combustion chamber and can be collected separately from other air pollution control \nresidues. APC residues result from the collection of other air pollutants from incinerator flue gases, \nespecially acid gases, volatilised heavy metals and other micro pollutants. The three wastes have \ndifferent compositions and will produce different emissions when landfilled. Fly ash and APC \nresidues are unlikely to meet the hazardous waste acceptance criteria for acceptance at a landfill \nsite, without treatment. \n \n18 \n The Environment Agency reports that incinerator bottom ash (IBA) is approximately 25% to \n30% by weight and 10% by volume of input, and APC residues are approximately 3% by weight of \nwaste input [28]. These data depend on factors which include quantity, composition of waste \nburnt, any recycling schemes and the design and operation of the plant. MSW IBA will have a \ndensity of about 1.5 tonnes m3. \n \n Chemical analysis and characterisation of bottom ash and APC residues from three UK \nincinerators has been undertaken [18]. An example of the chemical composition of fresh bottom \nash is presented in Polettini et al. [29]. \n \nPre-treatment processes such as carbonation and acid treatment have been demonstrated to \ninfluence the pH of the waste and hence affect the waste emissions (via leachate). Williams [30] \npresented typical composition of bottom ash, fly ash, and APC residues from a dry\/semi-dry \nsystem and a wet control system. \n \n For leachate produced from incinerator bottom ash and APC residues, Robinson et \nal. [18] reported that the trace elements and some of the major ions in leachates are strongly \ninfluenced by several chemical, and occasionally biological reactions that begin as soon as the ash \nreaches the quench tank and continue, often for many decades, within the landfill.  They reported \nthat variations in ash leachates are more likely to occur as a result of site topography and water \nregime than any variation in reactions occurring after landfilling. Leaching test data are therefore \nvalued as a good guide to actual leaching quality. Concentration ranges for maximum levels \n19 \nobserved in leaching tests on bottom ashes at liquid\/solid ratios below 0.5 are provided by \nHjelmar [31]. \n \n Inorganic components from a lysimeter study of bottom ash leached to a liquid\/solid (L\/S) \nratio of 1.4 have been reported by Stegmann et al. [32]. Throughout this lysimeter study, chloride \nexhibited a washout pattern, falling to a L\/S ratio of ~0.7, then continued at a lower concentration \nfor the remainder of the experiment. The pH remained high throughout due to the lime content, \nalthough sub-sampling at the end showed that lower pH values had developed in the upper \n(exposed) surface, indicating partial carbonation. \n \n Sulphate concentrations were initially low, presumably because of very high calcium \nconcentrations. Sulphate then fell further, before rising during the second half of the study, as \ncarbonation began to remove calcium from solution. This is consistent with a long-term decrease in \nalkalinity. At the end of the test only 2% of the sulphate content had been leached. \n \n Leachate quality data are available from a bottom ash landfill in Switzerland [33, 34]. L\/S \nratios at the time of the study were reported to be 0.2 \u2013 0.25. Dry weather concentrations of Cl, SO4 \nand Na were consistent with published eluate values for low L\/S ratios [31], while Total Organic \nCarbon (TOC), K, Ca and most of the heavy metals were generally at lower concentrations than \nindicated in eluate concentrations. \n \n A long-term dataset of leachate quality (1973 to 1998) is available for a PVC lined landfill [3]. \nThe site accepted ~85% bottom ash and ~15% fly ash. It was noted by Robinson et al. [18] that \n20 \ncopper concentrations correlated strongly with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) indicating the \npresence of strong organic complexes. This is an issue raised by a number of researchers working \nwith IBA leaching studies. It is possible that a number of other metals also exhibit similar relations \nwith DOC, but to a lower degree. The mobility of copper as a complex is likely to be far higher \nthan its mobility as a metal ion and could have implications for groundwater contamination from \nsites accepting IBA. \n \n Bottom ash, while having virtually no dioxins, contained large numbers of other trace \norganics including halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, BTEX compounds, alkenes \nand PAHs. Concentrations of trace organics were found to vary by up to three orders of magnitude \nin bottom ash from three different sites [18]. \n \n Carbonation is an important process that affects the physical and chemical nature of bottom \nashes. It is formed by the reaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide with lime in the wastes, forming \ncalcium carbonate. Carbonation of the bottom ash increases leachate concentrations of calcium and \nsulphate ions, but has no significant impact on the leaching of most other ions, DOC, organic \nnitrogen, and trace organics. However, it lowers pH significantly and the concentrations of certain \nheavy metals in the leachate by orders of magnitude, while some trace metals increase [18]. \nInsolubility of lead (in the short-term) can be ensured through accelerated aging of the fly ash by \neffective contact between wet fly ash and exhaust gas of the incineration plant [35]. \n \n21 \nFluidised bed incineration \n This type of thermal treatment (a simple modification to mass burn) involves the waste \nbeing used as a fuel, suspended by an updraft supply of air, and kept \u2018fluidised\u2019 on a base of small \ninert particles such as sand or dolomite. Pre-processing essentially involves the removal of large \nitems such as white goods and ferrous and non-ferrous metals and may be extended to include the \nrecovery of other materials such as recyclables. However, it is noted that savings are made when \ncompared with basic incineration systems because of the possibility of including lime in the \ncombustor material to inhibit the production of acid pollutants. Furthermore, there is no need for \nthe expensive bolt-on air pollution control systems typical of mass burn incinerators to clean up the \nflue gases. Fluidised bed incineration ensures a high level of waste destruction due to both the \npreparation of the waste and the method of combustion.  \n \n The incineration of MSW using a fluidised bed system is best achieved with some form of \npre-screening and shredding, or the production of RDF pellets. Fluidised bed incinerators also \nhave the potential for burning organic liquids, acid tars and sludges. \n \nPyrolysis \n Pyrolysis is the indirect heating of material in the absence of oxygen such that the organic \nmaterial is gasified and the resultant solid residues are inert and mainly contain carbon. Pyrolysis \ncan be used to treat organic wastes, rendering the residues biologically inert while extracting a fuel \nas an energy source for later use. Organic waste is transformed to a medium calorific gas, liquid \nand a char fraction. These contain hydrocarbons (gas and oils\/tars) and solid residue \n(char\/pyrolysis coke) containing carbon, ash, glass and non-oxidised metals. The pyrolysis process \n22 \noccurs without the release of polluting dust containing dioxins and\/or nitrogen oxides \n(combustible gases are released). These combustible gases can be used in any industrial application \nrequiring heat or energy. \n \n Studies have shown that increasing the temperature of pyrolysis decreases char production \nand increases oil and water production. Gas production increases between 300 and 420\u00b0C, but then \nstays constant. For flash pyrolysis at temperatures less than 600\u00b0C, the production of oil is very \nhigh; moreover, at temperatures above 700\u00b0C gas production is very high. \n \n The Plasma Pyrolysis\/Vitrification (PP\/V) system produces a solid vitrified residue which \npresents a low leachability of pollutants and low toxicity levels in leachates [36].  A number of \nwaste streams have been processed at the pyrolysis plant in Bristol including a batch of RDF. \nSubsequent analysis of the ash (char) is shown in Table 5 [37]. \n \nGasification \n Gasification is a similar process to pyrolysis but takes place with the addition of some \noxygen as air or steam. The process produces a mixture of combustible gases (primarily methane, \ncomplex hydrocarbons, hydrogen and carbon monoxide), ash and a tar. The major environmental \nbenefit of this process is that it retains pollutants (the sulphur, heavy metals etc.) in the ash instead \nof the gas phase and prevents subsequent discharge to the atmosphere. The emissions from this \ntechnology may be lower than produced by conventional incineration and will require less flue gas \ntreatment. There is little data available in the public domain regarding the contaminant \n23 \nconcentration of the char. Initial indications [37] are that the char may have similar leaching \nproperties to incinerator bottom ash.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n During the last two decades the estimated timescale for the potential polluting life of a large \nmodern landfill has increased from early estimates of 20-40 years to greater than 500-1000 years. \nCurrently, technical and financial provision for post-closure liabilities is usually made for a 30-60 \nyear period. Modelling results suggest that this period may be inadequate if measures are not \ntaken to increase the rate of waste stabilisation.  \n Initial benchmark study results for pre-Landfill Directive landfills suggest that two key \ncontaminants (lead and chloride) are likely to control the achievement of equilibrium status. A \nsecond scenario run with leachate concentrations set for stable non reactive hazardous waste going \nto a non-hazardous waste landfill (Landfill Directive) suggests that the post-closure management \nperiod is likely to be >1000 years for most contaminants with 50% of contaminants requiring >2000 \nyears to achieve equilibrium. The predicted timescales of centuries rather than decades suggest \nthat a reappraisal of the role of accelerated landfill stabilisation techniques such as aerobic and \nbioreactor landfilling is required. The benchmarking results presented here are a starting point and \nthe next stage was to model the most likely options that may contribute towards meeting the \nLandfill Directive diversion and pre-treatment targets. This forms a second manuscript that \npresents the full modelling methodology and results. \n \n24 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work was jointly funded by the Environment Agency for England and Wales and ESART. \nThis paper is published with permission.
