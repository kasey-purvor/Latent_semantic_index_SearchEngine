INTRODUCTION\nI nSb FIELD-EFFECT transistors (FETs) are of interest forlow-power, high-frequency applications. The low bandgap\nwith a very small electron mass and a very high mobility leads\none to expect that a very high-speed response is possible for\ncooled transistors. At room temperature, however, the high\nenergy tail of the thermal carrier distribution extends above\nthe bandgap energy where impact ionization processes and\nAuger generation are possible. This leads to high leakage\ncurrents. By using minority carrier exclusion techniques and\ncarrier extraction, it is possible to greatly reduce these leakage\ncurrents, making room-temperature operation feasible [1], [2].\nEarly work with a 1- m gate enhancement-mode FET has\nsuggested an intrinsic of about 90 GHz [2]. More recent\nwork concentrating on reducing parasitics has demonstrated\nan of 74 GHz with a 0.7- m gate [3]. This latter work\nhas also presented drift diffusion simulation results suggesting\nthat a very high-frequency response approaching 1 THz may\nbe possible with sub\u20130.1 micrometer gates. Very recent work\nusing quantum-well channels has reaffirmed the prediction of\nan of 1 THz for a 0.1- m gate [4]. This prediction neglects\nhot-carrier overshoot effects which might lead to even better\nhigh-frequency performance, however, it is not clear how the\nimpact ionization has been included in the modeling, and\nwhether low mobility holes in the channel will degrade the\nresponse. One aim of the present work is to include hot-carrier\nManuscript received November 8, 2004; revised March 16, 2005. The review\nof this paper was arranged by Editor C.-P. Lee.\nD. C. Herbert and P.

It\nshould be noted, however, that although InSb has the higher\nsaturated drift velocity, the InP-based high-electron mobility\ntransistors (HEMTs), have given the highest measured\nvalues to date. For example, a 550\u2013GHz pseudomorphic\nInP-HEMT using a 30\u2013nm gate has been reported by Shinohara\net al. [5].\nIn this paper, we use the self-consistent SLURPS two-dimen-\nsional Monte Carlo code [6] to explore the factors limiting the\nvery high-frequency response of narrow bandgap FETs. It is\nclear that inclusion of impact ionization is essential for real-\nistic studies and suitable subroutines have been added to the\nSLURPS software to make this possible. We have chosen to\nfocus on the InSb\u2013InAlSb material system and find that con-\ntrolling the ionization through doping profile and substrate bias\nis critical for achieving high-frequency response. This is par-\nticularly the case as the channel sheet charge density is raised\nto reduce channel resistance and minimize gate fringing fields.\nThe resulting potential drop at the drain side of the gate leads to\nstrong ionization effects. To control these effects we find it nec-\nessary to limit the source\/drain bias to less than 0.6 V and use a\nsubstrate-source bias of about 1.0 V. If defects and impurities\nreduce the channel mobility, then the carrier heating in the high\nfield at the drain edge of the gate becomes less effective and the\nbias constraints are relaxed. The presence of Al in the channel\nregion also reduces the mobility and therefore the speed, but in-\ncreases the bandgap and therefore reduces the ionization. If the\nhighest speeds are not a priority then using a low concentration\nof Al for the channel region could be a useful option.\nII. VELOCITY-FIELD CHARACTERISTICS\nIn Fig. 1, we show the computed velocity-field characteristics\nfor InSb. The calculation included , X, and L electron valleys\nand HH and LH valence bands. The results were calculated at\nroom temperature using electronmaterial parameters assembled\nfrom data in [7]\u2013[10] and listed in Table I. SLURPS obtains the\nmaterial parameters for the alloys used in transistor modeling,\nby interpolating between the values for InSb and AlSb so pa-\nrameters for both materials are listed in Table I. It should be\nnoted that there remains some considerable uncertainty for the\nvalues of hot-carrier material parameters. For the \u2013X and \u2013L\nintervalley phonon scattering coupling constant, we have used\neV\/m, a typical value for III-V compounds, from esti-\nmates based on pseudopotential wavefunctions [11], [12]. The\nindirect gap for InSb used here is also smaller than reported\nin earlier pseudo-potential band structure calculations [13]. Ve-\nlocity-field calculations using a wider indirect gap, however,\ngave similar results to Fig. 1, but with a gradually increasing\n0018-9383\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nHERBERT et al.: MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS OF HIGH-SPEED InSb\u2013InAlSb FETs 1073\nFig. 1. Velocity-field curves for InSb at room temperature.\nTABLE I\nELECTRON MATERIAL PARAMETERS\ndrift velocity rather than the weak tendency toward negative dif-\nferential mobility shown in Fig. 1 at the highest fields consid-\nered with s . This indicates that the electron\ntransport is dominated by the gamma valley where the material\nparameters are well established and is fairly insensitive to the\nother, more uncertain material parameters, associated with the\nsatellite valleys.\nFig. 2 shows the computed impact ionization coefficients. A\nKeldysh form for I, the ionization scattering rate, was used\n(1)\nwhere S is the rate constant. The ionization coefficient is ob-\ntained by dividing the averaged value of I by the drift velocity\nand is a measure of the number of ionization events per unit\nlength. There is uncertainty concerning the appropriate value\nfor S. We favor a value of s for electrons, with\nthe threshold energy taken as 1.08 where is the direct\ngap. The hole ionization calculation used s and\nFig. 2. Impact ionization coefficients for InSb at room temperature.\n. In a previous work on detectors [16], we found\nthat these values gave good agreement with measured ioniza-\ntion data in both InSb and CdHgTe with a similar band gap.\nThe lowest threshold energies are estimated by using energy\nand wave vector conservation, assuming that the electron ion-\nization involves the conduction band and heavy hole band and\nthe hole ionization involves the light hole band and conduction\nband. Electron ionization dominates over hole ionization within\nthe transistor channel. It is however important to allow for the\nweak hole ionization in the bulk of the buffer region as this gen-\nerates electrons which then avalanche while flowing toward the\ndrain. For electrons, a value of s has been ob-\ntained by fitting (1) to experimental data on photo-quantum effi-\nciency [14]. A first principles calculation, however, has yielded\na much smaller value of about s [15]. This latter\ncalculation used zero field wave functions and we would expect\nthat the very small electron mass and bandgap will make the\nobservable value of S very sensitive to electric fields, both ap-\nplied and from random charged impurities and defects, through\nthe associated band tailing. This implies that fitting S to exper-\nimental data should give the most reliable values. To check on\nthe sensitivity to Swe have included some electron drift velocity\nand ionization coefficient calculations obtained with the smaller\nvalue of S in Figs. 1 and 2. It is interesting to note that the ioniza-\ntion coefficient, which controls the carrier generation, is fairly\ninsensitive to the precise value of S at the highest fields where\nthe ionization is dominating the energy relaxation and electrons\nare predominantly in the valley. A major effect of reducing\nthe value of S, however, is an increase in the rate of electron\ntransfer to satellite valleys and consequently a strong negative\ndifferential mobility with reduced drift velocity. Reference [4]\nquotes a measured saturation velocity cm s which\nfrom Fig. 1 would favor the higher value for S.\nIn Fig. 1 we see that by using the high value for the electron\nionization coefficient, impact ionization prevents a large inter-\nvalley transfer and keeps the carriers within the -valley where\nthe low mass leads to a high drift velocity. This result has some\nsimilarity to a \u201chigh field Ohms law\u201d effect obtained in wider\ngap materials [17], in that the ionization by cooling the carriers,\nleads to velocity enhancement. From Fig. 2 it is striking that for\nlow electric fields the electron ionization dominates the hole ion-\nization with implications for low noise avalanching structures.\n1074 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 52, NO. 6, JUNE 2005\nFig. 3. Schematic geometry for the SLURPS transistor model. The detailed\nlayer structure for barrier, channel and buffer are given in Table II. The\nsource-to-drain separation was taken as 3.0 \u0000m.\nIII. TRANSISTOR MODELLING\nTo model the InSb-InAlSb transistors we used the ap-\nproach described previously for AlGaN transistors [6]. A\nsource-to-drain separation of 3 m was used with the Schottky\ngate electrode located on the surface of the wide gap InAlSb\nbarrier material, midway between source and drain. This bar-\nrier material contains a heavily doped layer to supply carriers\nto the narrow gap InSb channel material. A P-type buffer with\nsubstrate contact is used both to allow hole injection within\nthe Monte Carlo model and to extract the holes generated in\nthe channel by impact ionization. A schematic of the SLURPS\nmodel geometry is shown in Fig. 3. The 3\u2013 m separation of\nsource and drain was modeled with 192 mesh points. The\nbarrier and channel regions perpendicular to the surface to a\ndepth of 0.12 m were modeled with 32 mesh points and\nthe remaining 0.5 m of buffer depth was modeled with 64\nmesh points. Finer meshes were not possible due to memory\nlimitations with our current machines.\nInitial explorative modeling suggested that both channel ion-\nization and buffer ionization could be problematic. At low sub-\nstrate bias, holes generated in the channel tend to flow through\nthe channel toward the source. Low breakdown voltage then\nresults and the holes slow the transistor response. It was ob-\nserved that in this situation, excessive charge was injected from\nthe source contact to maintain charge neutrality. This electron\ncharge led to further ionization with a positive feedback loop\ncausing breakdown. This effect was eliminated by increasing the\nsubstrate reverse bias to an optimum value of about 1.0 V. To\nminimize spurious hole ionization in the buffer, the Al concen-\ntration was increased gradually in layers below the InSb channel\ntoward the substrate. For modeling convenience the Al concen-\ntration was increased in steps. Increasing the negative bias much\nbeyond 1.0 V caused avalanche breakdown as the electrons re-\nsulting from weak hole ionization in the buffer material, flowed\ntoward the drain.\nThe layer structure used for the first simulations is shown in\nTable II. A value of , the Al fraction, was taken as 0.4 for\nthe barrier material supporting the gate electrode. This barrier\nmaterial consisted of two layers of thickness m.\nThe top layer was low doped and the second layer was used\nto supply carriers to the channel. The doping in this second\nTABLE II\nLAYER STRUCTURE USED IN SLURPS MATERIAL In\u0000\u0002\u0002Al\u0000\u0003 \u0000 \u0002\u0002Sb,\nDOP DENOTES DOPING IN THE SUPPLY LAYER\nlayer (dop) was varied to obtain high and remote impu-\nrity scattering was neglected. The barrier thickness was chosen\nto be about 0.24 of the smallest gate length to be considered\n(0.031 m) in order to minimize spreading of the gate field\nwithin the channel. Simulations varying barrier thickness indi-\ncated that this was adequate for the present structures. For con-\nvenience this barrier thickness was retained for the various gate\nlengths considered. It may be difficult to fabricate such a thin\nbarrier layer and thicker layers may be suitable in practice for\nlonger gates, but in this paper, we are aiming to establish poten-\ntial high-frequency limits. In practice recessed gate structures\nwould be employed for the short gate length transistors. The\nchannel thickness was fixed at m and below the\nchannel three layers are used to step grade the material toward\na composition of . The value of and\nused for buffer and barrier respectively are not critical and are\nchosen to give effective modulation doping and suppression of\nbuffer hole ionization. Fabricated transistors have been reported\nwith for both buffer and barrier [3], [4] and for prac-\ntical designs it may be desirable to increase the value of x used in\nour simulations in order to achieve pseudomorphic growth of the\nstrained channel and barrier material. For convenience the sim-\nulations also place the Schottky gate directly on the barrier ma-\nterial while in practice a layer of SiO may be used to separate\nthe gate metal from the semiconductor. Below the step grading\nlayers we have included a P-doped layer, with variable doping\ndensity dop1, which has the effect of increasing the field driving\nholes away from the channel. It turns out that the value of this\ndoping density is important for preventing the hole flow toward\nthe substrate generating a self-consistent hole potential barrier\nbelow the channel. If the doping is too low, this potential bar-\nrier acts to increase the residual hole density within the channel\nand consequently reduces the transistor speed. The initial value\nused for dop1 is given in brackets in Table II. Our final result\nfor the maximum obtainable is obtained by simultaneously\ntuning the values of dop and dop1. In this case, an optimal sub-\nstrate bias value of V, together with the optimized\ndoping layer within the buffer, overcomes the residual potential\nbarriers from the step grading and the potential barrier resulting\nself-consistently from the hole flow. Below the p-doped layer\nwe include a low doped layer and a doped contact layer. The\ntotal thickness below the channel is 0.55 m.\nHERBERT et al.: MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS OF HIGH-SPEED InSb\u2013InAlSb FETs 1075\nTo compute the cutoff frequency for various transistor\nstructures, we applied a harmonic voltage with amplitude of\n0.05 V to the gate electrode and computed the terminal currents\nfor times exceeding 50 periods. The harmonic component of the\ncurrents was extracted by using Fourier integration and the cur-\nrent gain, defined as drain current divided by gate current\nat frequency , was averaged over the periods. The gain\nwas computed for several frequencies spanning the unit gain\nvalue. was then obtained by interpolation. The error in\nwas estimated to be typically less than 5% for the number of\nperiods used in the simulations. We found that plotting gain in\ndB against frequency on a log scale approximated quite well to\na straight line as commonly assumed for extrapolating experi-\nmental data to estimate . In this paper, however, we always\ninterpolate to estimate .\nIn general for the InSb transistors we found that increases\nwith increasing drain bias until the transistor gets close to break-\ndown. The sharp potential drop at the drain edge of the gate also\nincreases in magnitude with increasing drain bias. This leads to\nincreases in velocity under the gate and velocity overshoot and\nalso increases the effect of ionization on the drift velocity. In\npractice we found that a drain to source bias V was\nclose to optimum.\nIn Section IVwe present detailed results using a value of dop1\nequal to cm in order to illustrate the various effects\nwhich can limit the frequency response.We then consider tuning\nboth dop and dop1 in order to estimate the maximum available\n.\nIV. RESULTS\nWe initially settled on the layer structure shown in Table II,\nwhere the doping in the supply layer was chosen tomaximize\nfor fixed buffer doping. Fig. 4 shows results for the variation of\nwith supply layer doping for gate length m\nand bias voltages , , , and\n. It is seen that peaks for a doping density of\nabout dop cm which corresponds to a sheet\ndensity of cm . The source and drain currents\nare also shown on the plot and it is seen that the difference,\nId-Is increases with supply layer doping. This corresponds to\nincreasing current injection from ionization and the decrease in\nabove the peak is caused by increasing hole density within\nthe channel flowing toward the source. This interpretation was\nconfirmed by further calculations in which the electron-hole in-\njection due to ionization was turned off. The cooling effect of\nthe ionization for increasing the electron drift velocity was re-\ntained so that the correct electron drift velocity is used. The re-\nsults are shown in Fig. 5 and do indeed give higher values for\n, confirming that the hole injection is limiting the high-fre-\nquency performance. It is interesting to note that for the doping\ndensity of cm , the in Fig. 5 is very close to\nthe maximum of 690 GHz obtained with electron-hole injec-\ntion. This indicates that the hole extraction process is working\nwell at this value of dop. The peak in with no electron-hole\ninjection was, however, shifted to the higher value of 936 GHz\nat the higher doping level of dop cm .\nFig. 4. Dependence of cutoff frequency on doping density in the supply layer\nof Table II. The simulations were performed at room temperature and included\nboth electron and hole ionization.

These simulations were performed at room temperature and\nexcluded electron-hole injection from the ionization process. The effect of\nionization on the electron drift velocity was allowed for. The results indicate\nthe high-frequency potential from the high electron drift velocity. The bias\nvoltages were \u0000 \u0000 \u0002, \u0000 \u0000 \u0002\u0002\u0003\u0004, \u0000 \u0000 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0005, and \u0000 \u0000 \u0002\u0005\u0002\u0002.\nTo try to understand the peak for no electron-hole injec-\ntion as shown in Fig. 5, we have plotted the potential variation\nalong the channel from source to drain obtained with no elec-\ntron-hole injection, for different values of doping. The results\nused the optimum bias of , , .\nThe results in Fig. 6 show the variation of potential energy (or\nconduction band edge) along a line six mesh points (0.0225 m)\nfrom the surface with the source as origin. It appears that the\npotential drop between gate and drain, which corresponds to\na channel resistance, falls with increasing values of dop up to\nabout cm , which correlates well with the increase\nin high-frequency performance. The magnitude of the sharp po-\ntential drop at the drain side of the gate also varies with doping\nand affects the electron drift velocity under the gate. For values\nof dop above cm , the gate to drain resistance ap-\npears unchanged but the magnitude of the sharp potential drop\nat the drain edge of the gate decreases, which will reduce the ve-\nlocity under the gate. There is also a noticeable increase in the\n1076 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 52, NO. 6, JUNE 2005\nFig. 6.

The bias voltages were \u0002 \u0000 \u0002, \u0002 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0003\u0004, \u0002 \u0000 \u0000\u0002\u0003\u0005,\nand \u0002 \u0000 \u0000\u0005\u0003\u0002. This calculation switched off the electron-hole generation\nbut included the effect of ionization on the electron drift velocity. The buffer\ndoping was dop1 \u0000 \u0005\u0003\u0002 \u0000 \u0005\u0002 cm and curves are shown for a range of\nvalues of dop, the supply layer doping.\nsource to gate channel resistance for dop cm .\nThe channel resistance affects the through the RC time con-\nstants [5] and the behavior of in Fig. 5 can be explained as\ncaused by a combination of channel resistance and drift velocity\nvariation. It is interesting to note that there is a sharp potential\ndrop at the source end of the channel between the heavily doped\ncontact region and the intrinsic channel region. This high field\nregion also causes ionization, but the generated holes immedi-\nately flow into the heavily doped source contact region and have\nno effect on the transistor speed.\nThe case with electron-hole generation fully allowed for is\nmore complicated. The hole current flowing toward the sub-\nstrate contact leads to an Ohmic potential drop and the pos-\nitive space charge from holes below the channel can cause a\nweak repulsive hole potential which retards the hole flow away\nfrom the channel. This results in a buildup of hole charge within\nthe channel which flows toward the source contact. The slow\nmoving holes then degrade the frequency response. These ef-\nfects can be seen in Fig. 7 which plots the variation of the va-\nlence band edge with position in a direction from gate to sub-\nstrate. The different curves correspond to different values of\ndop and dop1 and are obtained with the optimum bias for the\n0.03125- m gate transistor. One curve shows the result with no\nelectron-hole injection and in this case the valence band edge\nrises to its value at the substrate contact with no de-biasing. The\ncurve labeled \u201cdop \u201d (units of cm ), corresponds to\nthe peak in Fig. 4 and the curve labeled \u201cdop \u201d corre-\nsponds to the situation where has fallen from its peak value.\nIt can be seen that a weak hole repulsive potential barrier has\ndeveloped below the channel confirming our explanation of the\npeak . It should be noted that the potential has been plotted\nsuch that electrons flow \u201cdownhill\u201d and holes flow \u201cuphill\u201d in\nthis paper. The remaining curve shows results where dop has\nbeen increased to cm and dop1 has simultane-\nously been increased to cm in order to maximize\nwith respect to both of these parameters. In this case, the\nFig. 7. Variation of valence band edge with position along a direction from\ngate to substrate. The potential is defined such that holes flow up hill.

The\nfixed bias voltages were \u0002 \u0000 \u0002, \u0002 \u0000 \u0002\u0002\u0003\u0005, \u0002 \u0000 \u0002\u0005\u0003\u0002. The calculation\nincluded electron-hole injection.\np-doping in the buffer layer dop1 is sufficient to overcome the\nhole flow retarding barrier.\nThe justification for using a drain voltage of 0.58 V is\ngiven in Fig. 8. We show results for as a function of\ndrain voltage obtained with electron-hole injection for gate\nlength m and a supply layer doping of\ncm . We see that increases linearly with at\nlow voltages and flattens out for V. In practice, 0.58 V\nis close to optimum. Using higher drain bias takes the transistor\ntoo close to breakdown.\nHaving set the doping density and bias values as dop\ncm , dop cm , , ,\n, we performed a series of calculations of keeping\nthe geometry and bias voltages fixed but varying gate length.\nThe results in Fig. 9 show the flattening of performance at very\nshort gate lengths which we interpret as caused by increasing\nhole density in the channel, flowing toward the source. It is also\nnoticeable that the source and drain currents start to increase\nquite rapidly for very short gate lengths. This implies an in-\ncreasing hole current flowing toward the substrate with asso-\nciated debiasing and the possibility of a weak self-consistent\nbarrier developing to impede the flow.\nHERBERT et al.: MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS OF HIGH-SPEED InSb\u2013InAlSb FETs 1077\nFig. 9.

Doping values were dop \u0000 \u0006\u0003\u0002 \u0000\n\u0005\u0002 cm , dop\u0005 \u0000 \u0005\u0003\u0002\u0000 \u0005\u0002 cm .\nThe steady-state currents for the 690\u2013GHz transistor are\nshown in Fig. 10. The fixed bias voltages were ,\n. The sheet doping in the supply layer was\ncm , the gate length was 0.03125 m and dop1\nwas cm . It is seen that the ionization current sets\nin for V. The source current gradually increases over\nthe entire range of drain voltage. For V this is in\npart caused by some holes flowing into the source contact. The\npredominant hole current, however, flows to the substrate as\nindicated by the larger slope of the substrate and drain currents.\nThis indicates that the substrate bias is effective in extracting\nthe ionization induced holes.\nIf the substrate voltage is reduced to 0.5 V with\nV and V then the efficiency of\nhole extraction is reduced, the hole current flowing to source\nincreases and the transistor breaks down. This breakdown\noccurs on a timescale which is noticeably longer than conven-\ntional avalanche breakdown. We think that this is caused by the\nprocess of carrier injection from the source contact required to\nmaintain charge neutrality with the slow moving hole charge in\nthe channel. The source injected electrons induce more holes\nby ionization creating a positive feed back loop. A similar\nbreakdown process has been described in the literature for\nshort channel Si MOSFETs where it is explained as a parasitic\nFig. 11.

The pinchoff voltage is\naround 0.7 V. It can be seen that the substrate current locks\nto the drain current near pinch off. This is caused by the source\ncurrent being blocked by a potential barrier in the channel\nunder the gate. The residual ionization current flows such that\nthe holes move to the substrate contact and the electrons move\nto the drain contact. It is interesting to note that the substrate\ncurrent locks to the source current for gate voltages above about\n0.4 V. This effect is not observed for lower drain voltages and\nis thought to indicate that the current multiplication in the high\nfield region close to the gate happens to be close to two. The\nresult indicates that the channel current multiplication is inde-\npendent of gate voltage for and that the generated\nholes are flowing predominantly toward the substrate, away\nfrom the channel as required for high speed operation.\nHaving observed that the high-frequency performance is lim-\nited by an increasing hole density within the channel, which\nin turn is caused by debiasing and the formation of a weak\nhole potential barrier below the channel, it was a simple matter\nto adjust dop and dop1 simultaneously in order to maximize\n. In this way, we estimated the optimum values as dop\ncm , dop cm which yielded\nGHz. This value is still significantly below the 936\nGHz obtained with no electron-hole injection and indicates that\na small residual hole charge remains in the channel, degrading\nthe performance. In practice, however, we expect that the tech-\nnical difficulty of fabrication and elimination of parasitics will\ndominate any further development so that loss of the last 10%\nof potential performance may not seem so important!\nV. CONCLUSION\nExtensive self consistent Monte Carlo simulations are re-\nported for the InSb material system at room temperature. It is\nfound that impact ionization, by cooling electrons and reducing\nintervalley transfer to low mobility satellite valleys, leads to\nunusually high drift velocities. This high saturated drift velocity\ncan be exploited in FETs by optimising the substrate bias and\nbuffer doping to extract holes generated in the channel. The\nvery high-frequency performance expected from electron drift\n1078 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 52, NO. 6, JUNE 2005\nvelocities alone is however limited by residual hole charge in\nthe channel. The peak for a 0.03125 m gate is predicted\nto be about 820 GHz which is well above the demonstrated\n550 GHz for a 0.03- m gate in the InP material system. It\nshould be noted, however, that in practice channel mobility can\nbe reduced from the ideal and parasitics can limit the highest\nfrequency response so that comparing an ideal theoretical\nnumber with an experimental value may be unduly optimistic.\nIf one could completely remove the ionization induced holes\nfrom the channel, then the peak could be increased to around\n940 GHz according to Fig. 5. For the structures considered in\nthis paper this does not appear possible. One could perhaps\nconsider quantum well channels to exploit the higher 2 DEG\nmobility and better carrier confinement [4], however in this\ncase the confining barriers may also impede the hole flow away\nfrom the channel and degrade performance. The predicted peak\nfor the structures considered is impressive, confirming that\nthis material system has the potential for extremely high speed\nlow power devices, in overall agreement with the conclusions\nof other authors [3], [4].\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.
