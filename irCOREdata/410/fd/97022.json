Furthermore it is shown why\nthe numerically determined threshold exponents are not the true asymptotic values.\n1. Introduction\nIt is well known that certain laminar flows are linearly stable (i.e. stable to in-\n\fnitesimal perturbations) at all Reynolds numbers, R, but in practice always become\nturbulent for su\u000eciently large Reynolds number. Examples include plane Couette flow\nand pipe Poiseuille flow (Romanov 1973; Davey 1973; Drazin & Reid 1981). On the\nother hand, plane Poiseuille flow does exhibit a critical Reynolds number Rc \u0019 5772\n(Orszag 1971) at which an unstable mode appears (the so-called Tollmien{Schlichting\nwave), but in practice the transition for this flow also often occurs at much lower\nReynolds numbers. The resolution of these paradoxes is a long-standing problem in\nfluid mechanics. One school of thought is that the domain of attraction of the laminar\nflow shrinks as R ! 1, so that this flow is nonlinearly unstable to small but \fnite\nperturbations. This idea goes back at least to Thomson (1887) and Orr (1907).\nAlmost all of the work on transition in plane Poiseuille flow is concerned with\nthe neutral curve (see, for example Drazin & Reid 1981). One theory of subcritical\ntransition is based on a weakly nonlinear analysis about this curve, as in Stuart (1960)\nand Watson (1960) (see also Reynolds & Potter 1967). The Landau equation for the\namplitude of the linearly neutral solution shows that the bifurcation is subcritical,\nand the position of the steady (periodic) state determines the threshold amplitude for\ntransition. A similar approach has been attempted for plane Couette flow, in which\nthe \u2018bifurcation\u2019 to a non-trivial state occurs at R = 1 rather than a \fnite value of\nR. Cowley & Smith (1985), Nagata (1990), Ehrenstein & Koch (1991) and Cherhabili\n& Ehrenstein (1997) all look for nonlinear steady or periodic states which are close\nto the laminar state, and which are seen as determining the threshold amplitude for\n36 S. J. Chapman\ntransition. However, while such steady states certainly give an upper bound on the\nthreshold amplitude for transition, the threshold itself is determined by the stable\nmanifold through these states, which is an order of magnitude harder to determine\n(even if we could \fnd the \u2018closest\u2019 non-trivial solution). This point is illustrated well in\nthe toy model of x 2: even though the number of degrees of freedom is only increased\nfrom one (the amplitude in the Landau equation) to two, the scaling of the threshold\namplitude di\u000bers from that of the nearest non-trivial steady state.\nAn alternative approach is to look directly at the initial value problem. Based on\nthe observation that the route to transition is invariably three-dimensional (even in\nthe case of plane Poiseuille flow, for which the one unstable mode is two-dimensional),\nmany theories look for a secondary instability of a solution of the linearized equations.\nWeakly nonlinear theories have been proposed by Benney & Lin (1960) and Benney\n(1961, 1964), in which two terms of an amplitude expansion are kept, with the \frst\nterm slowly decaying. The second-order term is observed to perturb the mean flow\ntowards an inflectional pro\fle, which would then generate a secondary instability.\nNo attempt is made to relate the amplitude expansion to the Reynolds number and\nthereby obtain a threshold amplitude, so that the approach remains slightly ad hoc;\nthe second-order terms can never perturb the mean flow enough enough to produce\ninstability in the asymptotic limit considered. Nevertheless, these works were among\nthe \frst to realise the importance of streamwise vorticity in redistributing momentum,\na mechanism which is a key ingredient of the present analysis, and which we will\nreturn to shortly.\nThe obvious solution of the linearized equations to examine in this fashion is the\nmost slowly decaying mode, which gives the greatest time for instability to set in.\nOrszag & Kells (1980) and Orszag & Patera (1983) examine numerically the secondary\ninstability of the least stable (and therefore two-dimensional) mode for plane Couette\nand subcritical plane Poiseuille flow. They \fnd that \fnite-amplitude two-dimensional\ndisturbances can become catastrophically unstable to three-dimensional perturbations.\nDavey & Nguyen (1971) attempt to obtain a threshold amplitude in this way using\nan ad hoc truncation of a nonlinear perturbation of the least stable mode.\nHowever, it was later realised that there may be solutions of the linearized equations\nwhich actually grow transiently in time before they \fnally decay, and that a secondary\ninstability of these solutions is more likely to be the optimal route to transition. Early\nwork (Gustavsson & Hultgren 1980; Benney & Gustavsson 1981; Gustavsson 1986;\nJang, Benney & Gran 1986; Shantini 1989) looked for an exact resonance of an\nOrr{Sommerfeld and a Squire eigenvalue to achieve this transient growth.\nLater it was realised that in fact exact resonance is not necessary to obtain transient\ngrowth. The fact that the eigenfunctions of the linearized Navier{Stokes equations\nare not orthogonal (i.e. the operator is non-normal) is enough to give the existence of\ninitial conditions which exhibit transient growth before \fnally decaying (Farrell 1988;\nGustavsson 1991; Henningson 1991; Butler & Farrell 1992; Henningson, Lundbladh\n& Johansson 1993), and in fact there is no additional growth at an exact resonance\n(Reddy & Henningson 1993). For large Reynolds number the operator is highly\nnon-normal, and the transient growth is asymptotically large in R. In Reddy &\nHenningson (1993) and Reddy, Schmid & Henningson (1993) the non-normality of\nthe linearized operator is examined using pseudospectra, and linked to the transient\ngrowth.\nThe idea that the small domain of attraction is caused by a \u2018linear ampli\fcation\nplus nonlinear mixing\u2019 (Boberg & Brosa 1988) has been built on by Trefethen et al.\n(1993), who propose simple toy models in which the conservative nonlinear terms feed\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 37\nthe transient linear growth back into the system, leading to a low threshold amplitude\nfor transition. Various other low-dimensional models with these qualitative features\nare reviewed in Baggett & Trefethen (1997).\nA key question, posed in Trefethen et al. (1993), is to determine the behaviour of the\nthreshold amplitude for transition as a function of R as R !1, that is, to determine\nthe smallest \u03b3 such that a perturbation of norm O(R\u03b3) may lead to transition. While\nthis question makes sense as it stands for plane Couette flow, which is linearly stable\nfor all Reynolds numbers, it requires some interpretation for plane Poiseuille flow,\nfor which an in\fnitesimal perturbation will lead to transition as R ! 1, since the\nflow is linearly unstable. In that case we will factor out the unstable mode and\nconsider the threshold amplitude of the remaining linearly stable system. The reason\nsuch an analysis is interesting is that while the asymptotic analysis to follow will be\nbased on R ! 1, we would expect that the results are qualitatively similar in the\nregion R < 5772 (since 5772 \u001d 1), in which the flow is linearly stable. We expect\nthe small domain of attraction of the laminar state and the route to transition at\nsubcritical Reynolds numbers to be qualitatively similar to that of the stable part of\nthe system as R !1. In fact, such an interpretation is not necessary for the periodic\nflows with period independent of Reynolds number with which we will be primarily\nconcerned, since for them plane Poiseuille flow is linearly stable in the limit as R !1,\nbecause the unstable streamwise wavenumbers \u000b on an in\fnite domain lie in a band\nO(R\u22121=7) 6 \u000b 6 O(R\u22121=11) (see, for example, Drazin & Reid 1981).\nIt was conjectured in Trefethen et al. (1993), based on their simple models, that\n\u03b3 < \u22121, which appears to be the \frst conjecture on the value of the exponent. Kreiss,\nLundbladh & Henningson (1994) prove a lower bound for \u03b3 for plane Couette flow\nof \u221221=4, while numerical experiments by Lundbladh, Henningson & Reddy (1994)\nand Reddy et al. (1998) suggest that \u03b3 \u0019 \u22125=4 for plane Couette flow and \u03b3 \u0019 \u22127=4\nfor plane Poiseuille flow in a periodic domain.\nIn fact there are two routes to transition examined in Lundbladh et al. (1994) and\nReddy et al. (1998), which are\n(i) streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks\n! secondary instability of oblique modes;\n(ii) oblique modes! streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks\n! secondary instability of oblique modes:\nA streamwise vortex is an elongated region of vorticity approximately aligned with\nthe basic laminar flow, while a streamwise streak is an elongated region of relatively\nhigh or low velocity approximately aligned with this flow. By oblique mode we\nmean any perturbation not aligned with the flow, that is, a perturbation which is\nstreamwise dependent. In (i) the non-normality of the linearized equations means that\na small streamwise vortex produces a large streamwise streak as it decays, which then\nproduces a secondary oblique instability. In (ii) an initial perturbation in the form of\na pair of oblique modes grows transiently at the same time generating a streamwise\nvortex. The route to transition then proceeds as in (i).\nWe will be concerned here with channel flows, namely plane Couette and plane\nPoiseuille flow. We will determine the scaling of the threshold amplitude for the\nroutes (i) and (ii) to transition by using an asymptotic analysis of the Navier{Stokes\nequations to quantify the qualitative ideas of Trefethen et al. (1993). We will also\ndetermine the threshold amplitude for the alternative route to transition\n(iii) streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks! streamwise vortices;\n38 S. J.

We will \fnd that the lowest threshold exponent\nfor plane Couette flow is \u03b3 = \u22121, which occurs for routes (i), (ii) and (iii), while that\nfor plane Poiseuille flow occurs via route (i), and is \u03b3 = \u22123=2. We will also explain\nwhy the numerical computations mentioned above obtained di\u000berent exponents (see\ntable 1).\nWe begin by introducing a low-dimensional toy model which illustrates the routes\nto transition of the Navier{Stokes equations described above, and with which we are\nable to explain the main ideas involved. Then, in x 3 we formulate the Navier{Stokes\nequations in a convenient way for the subsequent analysis. In x 4 we determine the\nnature and magnitude of the transient growth in the (stable) linearized equations.\nIn x 5 we show how to calculate the asymptotic position of the eigenvalues of the\nlinearized equations, which will enable us to determine how large a perturbation of\nthe base flow needs to be in order to signi\fcantly perturb these eigenvalues. In x 6 we\nbriefly consider the nature of the secondary instability in the oblique modes before\ncombining the results of xx 4 and 5 with an examination of the nonlinear equations\nin x 7, which allows us to determine the threshold amplitude exponents for transition.\nIn x 8 we compare our asymptotic results to the numerical results of Lundbladh et\nal.

(1993)\nd \ndt\n+ 2\u000f = (\u001e2 +  2)1=2\u001e; (2.1)\nd\u001e\ndt\n+ \u000f\u001e\u2212  = \u2212(\u001e2 +  2)1=2 : (2.2)\nThe variables  and \u001e represent the input and output of a non-modal ampli\fer;\nfor our present purposes we may think of them as representing streamwise vortices\nand streamwise streaks respectively in the route to transition (iii) above, though\nTrefethen et al. (1993) are deliberately not so speci\fc. The nonlinear terms represent\na conservative feedback mechanism.\nLet us \frst consider the linearized equations. The linear system is stable but highly\nnon-normal in that the two eigenvectors are almost parallel. This non-normality leads\nto the existence of initial conditions for which there is a large transient growth before\nthe \fnal decay. An initial condition of the form (\u001e;  ) = (0; \u000f\u03a8 ) will generate a\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 39\nNonlinear\nmixing\nLinear\n  growth\nSquare\n\u00b7 1\/e\n\u00b7 1\/e\nStreamwise\nvortices\nw~e3\nStreamwise\nstreaks\nu~e2\nFigure 1.

The factor of 2 is\ninserted into equation (2.1) so that the eigenvalues are distinct. In fact nothing special\nhappens if the eigenvalues are repeated; the scalings and transient growth are the\nsame. With distinct eigenvalues the transient growth is of the form e\u2212\u000ft\u2212 e\u22122\u000ft, which\nbecomes \u000fte\u2212\u000ft if the factor of 2 is replaced by unity. A similar phenomenon occurs\nwith the linearized Navier{Stokes equations: the non-normality determines the degree\nof transient growth, and the resonance or not of eigenvalues is unimportant.\nBased on the observation above, we rescale the equations so that  \u0018 \u000f\u001e, and we\nrescale time so that we are working on the timescale for transient growth. The scale\nfor \u001e is then chosen so that the largest nonlinear term balances with the linear part\nof the system. Thus we set\nt = \u000f\u22121t^; \u001e = \u000f2\u001e^1;  = \u000f3 ^1: (2.3)\nKeeping only the leading-order nonlinear terms in the new scaling the system becomes\nd ^\ndt^\n+ 2 ^ = \u001e^j\u001e^j; (2.4)\nd\u001e^\ndt^\n+ \u001e^\u2212  ^ = 0: (2.5)\nNow, for initial conditions (\u001e^;  ^) = (0; \u03a8^ ) equation (2.5) generates a linear growth in\n\u001e^, as  ^ decays, which couples back nonlinearly into  ^ through equation (2.4). This\nmechanism is illustrated schematically in \fgure 1, in which a single arrow represents\na linear mechanism, while a double arrow represents a nonlinear mechanism. If \u03a8^ is\nsu\u000eciently large the solution will not converge to the origin (representing the laminar\nstate) but to another stationary point (representing transition). Thus, from (2.3), the\nthreshold amplitude for transition in this model is O(\u000f3).\nThis simple model also serves to illustrate the point made in the introduction about\nthe relationship between non-trivial steady states and threshold amplitudes. The\nexistence of a threshold amplitude in (2.4){(2.5) is due to the non-trivial stationary\npoints \u001e^ =  ^ = \u00062. However, knowing that this solution exists is not enough to\ndetermine the threshold amplitude, since the threshold is determined by the stable\nmanifold through this stationary point. In particular, this stationary point lies a\ndistance O(\u000f2) from the origin (the scaling on \u001e), while the threshold amplitude is\nO(\u000f3) (since an initial perturbation with \u001e^ = 0 and  ^ su\u000eciently large will lead to\ntransition).\nAlthough this toy model illustrates many of the features of transition through\nroute (iii), we will \fnd when we consider the Navier{Stokes equations in x 4 that\n40 S. J. Chapman\nthe nonlinear coupling between streamwise streaks and streamwise vortices is much\nweaker than that given by (2.1){(2.2); in fact the nonlinear terms are multiplied by a\nfactor of \u000f2, so that the threshold amplitude for transition is only O(\u000f).\nIt turns out that the dominant routes to transition are (i) and (ii). A simple toy\nmodel which illustrates these routes to transition is the four-dimensional system\nd 1\ndt\n+ 2\u000f 1 = \u001e\n2\n2; (2.6)\nd\u001e1\ndt\n+ \u000f\u001e1 \u2212  1 = 0; (2.7)\nd 2\ndt\n+ 2\u000e 2 = \u001e1\u001e2; (2.8)\nd\u001e2\ndt\n+ \u000e\u001e2 \u2212  2 = 0: (2.9)\nHere \u001e1 and  1 represent streamwise streaks and streamwise vortices respectively,\nwhile \u001e2 and  2 represent all the oblique modes.\nThe linearized equations decouple into a pair of stable, non-normal two-dimensional\nsystems of the form (2.1){(2.2); the \frst has transient growth of order \u000f\u22121 over a\ntimescale \u000f\u22121, while the second has transient growth of order \u000e\u22121 over a timescale\n\u000e\u22121. We assume that 0 < \u000f \u001c \u000e \u001c 1; we will \fnd that this is the case for the\nNavier{Stokes equations.\nThe nonlinear terms have been simpli\fed (based on the observation above that the\nimportant feedback is through \u001e), and are chosen to be consistent with the coupling\nbetween streamwise and oblique modes: the product of two non-zero-wavenumber\n(oblique) modes may give a zero-wavenumber (streamwise) mode, while the product\nof a zero-wavenumber mode and a non-zero-wavenumber mode gives a non-zero-\nwavenumber mode.\nWe rescale the equations so that  1 \u0018 \u000f\u001e1 and  2 \u0018 \u000e\u001e2. The scales for \u001e1 and\n\u001e2 are chosen so that the nonlinear terms balance with the linear part of each two-\ndimensional system. We also scale time so that we are working on the shorter of the\ntwo timescales. Thus we set\nt = \u000e\u22121t^; \u001e1 = \u000e2\u001e^1;  1 = \u000f\u000e2 ^1; \u001e2 = \u000f\u000e\u001e^2;  2 = \u000f\u000e2 ^2: (2.10)\nIn the new scaling the system becomes(\n\u000e\n\u000f\n)\nd ^1\ndt^\n+ 2 ^1 = \u001e^\n2\n2; (2.11)\n(\n\u000e\n\u000f\n)\nd\u001e^1\ndt^\n+ \u001e^1 \u2212  ^1 = 0; (2.12)\nd ^2\ndt^\n+ 2 ^2 = \u001e^1\u001e^2; (2.13)\nd\u001e^2\ndt^\n+ \u001e^2 \u2212  ^2 = 0: (2.14)\nNow, on this short timescale we see from (2.11), (2.12) that to leading order d\u001e^1=dt^ =\nd ^1=dt^ = 0, so that \u001e^1 and  ^1 are constant. The system for the remaining variables\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 41\nis then linear, with eigenvalues given by\n\u0015 = \u22121\u0006 (\u001e^1)1=2: (2.15)\nFor Re((\u001e^1)\n1=2) > 1 one eigenvalue has positive real part, corresponding to an oblique\nmode instability. For Re((\u001e^1)\n1=2) < 1 both eigenvalues have negative real part, and\nthe oblique modes decay to zero. Let us now determine the scaling of the threshold\namplitude for initial conditions in the form of streamwise vortices and in the form of\noblique modes.\nWe consider \frst the route to transition (i), which requires an initial perturbation\nin the form of streamwise vortices, corresponding to an initial condition of the form\n(\u001e^1;  ^1; \u001e^2;  ^2) = (0; \u03a8^1; 0; 0). Since \u001e^1 and  ^1 evolve over the long timescale t^ \u0018 \u000e=\u000f,\nwe \frst rescale time with \u000e=\u000f to give\nd ^1\nd~t\n+ 2 ^1 = \u001e^\n2\n2; (2.16)\nd\u001e^1\nd~t\n+ \u001e^1 \u2212  ^1 = 0; (2.17)( \u000f\n\u000e\n) d ^2\nd~t\n+ 2 ^2 = \u001e^1\u001e^2; (2.18)\n( \u000f\n\u000e\n) d\u001e^2\nd~t\n+ \u001e^2 \u2212  ^2 = 0; (2.19)\nwhere t^ = (\u000e=\u000f)~t. Since initially Re((\u001e^1)\n1=2) < 1 if there were any oblique modes they\nwould decay quickly to zero. Thus we are left with the stable linear system\nd ^1\nd~t\n+ 2 ^1 = 0; (2.20)\nd\u001e^1\nd~t\n+ \u001e^1 \u2212  ^1 = 0; (2.21)\nfor \u001e^1 and  ^1. Now our initial condition of the form (\u001e^1;  ^1) = (0; \u03a8^1) will give tran-\nsient growth in \u001e^1 while  ^1 decays to zero (streamwise vortices producing streamwise\nstreaks). If this transient growth is enough to take Re((\u001e^1)\n1=2) above unity, then the\nsystem for \u001e^2,  ^2 becomes unstable on a short timescale. An in\fnitesimal perturbation\nof this system has exponential growth with a rate of order \u000e=\u000f on the long timescale\nover which \u001e^1 and  ^1 are decaying. Such a perturbation will therefore quickly become\norder one, the nonlinear terms in (2.16) \u2018kick in\u2019 to keep \u001e^1 above unity, and the\nfeedback leads to transition away from the zero state. Thus an order-one  ^1 is enough\nto induce transition, so that, by (2.10), the threshold amplitude for streamwise vortices\nis O(\u000f\u000e2). This route to transition is shown schematically in \fgure 2.\nLet us now consider the route to transition (ii), requiring an initial condition in\nthe form of oblique modes, (\u001e^1;  ^1; \u001e^2;  ^2) = (0; 0; 0; \u03a8^2). On the short timescale t^ \u0018 1\nover which  ^2 decays there will be transient growth in \u001e^2. However, in the present\nscaling, during this transient growth phase the nonlinear terms in (2.11) generate a\nstreamwise vortex  ^1 only of order \u000f=\u000e, whereas we have seen that a streamwise\nvortex  ^1 of order one is required for transition to occur. In order to generate a\nstreamwise vortex of order one from an oblique mode, the nonlinear terms in (2.11)\n42 S. J.

Hence the threshold amplitude\nfor an initial perturbation comprising oblique modes is O(\u000f1=2\u000e5=2). This route to\ntransition is shown schematically in \fgure 3.\nNotice that during each phase of the transition (until the nonlinear evolution of\nthe fully developed secondary oblique mode instability) we only have to solve linear\nequations. During the \frst phase of the transient growth of oblique modes we have\nthe linear system (2.26){(2.27) (remember that the right-hand side of (2.26) is zero\nduring this phase). Then ~\u001e2 is known, so that (2.24) is a forced linear equation for\n ^1. During the next phase we have the linear system (2.20){(2.21) to describe the\nevolution of \u001e^1 and  ^1. Finally, the secondary oblique-mode instability is described\nby (2.13){(2.14), which is a linear system for \u001e^2,  ^2, since \u001e^1 is known.\nThis scenario of transition, being governed by a series of (possibly forced) linear\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 43\nLinear\ngrowth \u00b7 1\/e\nStreamwise\nvortices\nw1~ ed\n2\nStreamwise\nstreaks\nu1~ d\n2\n\u00b7 1\/d\n\u00b7 1\/d Oblique\nmodes\nu2\nOblique\nmodes\nw2\nUnstable linear system\nLinear\ngrowth\n\u00b7 1\/d\nOblique\nmodes\nw2~ e\n1\/2d5\/2\nOblique\nmodes\nu2~ e\n1\/2d3\/2\nNonlinear\nforcing Square \u00b7 1\/d\nFigure 3.

The reason for the choice of the nonlinear terms in\n(2.6){(2.9) now becomes clear: products of oblique modes appear on the right-hand\nside of (3.25) and (3.26), while streamwise modes appear on the right-hand side of\n(3.27) and (3.28) only as a product with an oblique mode.\nThe natural separation between streamwise and oblique modes occurs because, as\nwe shall see in x 4, the timescale for the evolution of streamwise modes in (3.25) and\n(3.26) is R (so that \u000f of x 2 is R\u22121), while that for the evolution of the oblique modes\nin (3.27) and (3.28) is R1=3 (so that \u000e of x 2 is R\u22121=3).\nWe need to choose a norm with which to measure the amplitude of a solution.\n46 S. J. Chapman\nWe will consider both the L1 norm, which measures the maximum amplitude of the\nperturbation\nkuk1 = max\nx;y;z\nfjuj; jvj; jwjg; (3.29)\nand the L2 or energy norm, which measures the total energy of the perturbation, and\nfor periodic solutions is\nkuk2 =\n(\n1\n2V\n\u222b\nperiod in x;z\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n(u2 + v2 + w2) dy dx dz\n)1=2\n; (3.30)\nwhere V is the volume of integration. For a single mode, using (3.19), (3.20), these\nbecome\nkuk1 = max\nx;y;z\n{\n1\nk2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u000bdv\u000b\fdy \u2212 \f\u0011\u000b\f\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ; jv\u000b\f j; 1k2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\f dv\u000b\fdy + \u000b\u0011\u000b\f\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223}\nand\nkuk2 =\n(\n1\n8k2\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n((\ndv\u000b\f\ndy\n)2\n+ k2(v\u000b\f)2 + (\u0011\u000b\f)2\n)\ndy\n)1=2\n:\nIn fact for the solutions we are interested in we will \fnd that both these norms scale\nin the same way.\nThere are four steps that we need to complete in order to calculate the threshold\namplitude for transition, namely we need to know\n(i) how much transient growth there is in streamwise modes;\n(ii) how much transient growth there is in oblique modes;\n(iii) how large a streamwise vortex is produced during the growth and decay of an\noblique mode;\n(iv) how large a streamwise streak has to grow in order to produce a secondary\ninstability.\nIn the next section we will investigate (i) and (ii). In x 5 we consider (iv), by examining\nthe eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the linearized equations asymptotically as\nR ! 1. Then, in x 7, we consider (iii), and combine the four results to determine the\nthreshold amplitudes for transition.\n4. Transient growth of the linearized equations\nWe need to calculate the transient growth of the linearized system\n\u2212\n(\n@2\n@y2\n\u2212 k2\n)\n@v\n@t\n= \u2212\n(\n@2\n@y2\n\u2212 k2\n)2\nv\nR\n+ i\u000bU\n(\n@2\n@y2\n\u2212 k2\n)\nv \u2212 i\u000bd\n2U\ndy2\nv; (4.1)\n@\u0011\n@t\n= \u2212i\f dU\ndy\nv \u2212 i\u000bU\u0011 +\n(\n@2\n@y2\n\u2212 k2\n)\n\u0011\nR\n; (4.2)\nwith boundary conditions\nv(\u00061; t) = 0; (4.3)\n@v\n@y\n(\u00061; t) = 0; (4.4)\n\u0011(\u00061; t) = 0; (4.5)\nwhere k2 = \u000b2 + \f2, and we have dropped the superscript \u000b\f for ease of notation.\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 47\nIf the period in x is \fnite as R ! 1 there are two cases to consider, namely the\nstreamwise mode \u000b = 0, and the oblique modes \u000b 6= 0.\nOn an in\fnite domain the relevant cases to consider are \u000b = O(1=R) and \u000b\u001d 1=R;\nwe refer to the former as the streamwise modes (even though they vary slowly with\nposition down the channel) and the latter as the oblique modes.\n4.1. Transient growth of streamwise modes\nWe set \u000b = \u0016\u000b=R with \u0016\u000b of order one. Then both (4.1) and (4.2) give evolution on a\nlong timescale of order R, so we also rescale time by setting t = R\u0016t, giving\n\u2212(vyy \u2212 \f2v)\u0016t \u2212 i\u0016\u000bU(vyy \u2212 \f2v) + i\u0016\u000bU 00v + vyyyy \u2212 2\f2vyy + \f4v = 0; (4.6)\n\u0011\u0016t + i\u0016\u000bU\u0011 + iR\fU\n0v \u2212 (\u0011yy \u2212 \f2\u0011) = 0: (4.7)\nNeither equation is now singularly perturbed, so that both v and \u0011 will vary on an\norder-one lengthscale. From (4.7) we see that the correct relative scaling of \u0011 and v is\n\u0011 = O(Rv). Hence an initial condition of the form (v; \u0011) = (v0; 0) will have transient\ngrowth in \u0011 to order Rv0 (so that there is growth in the norm of the solution by a\nfactor of order R) over a timescale of order R.\nWe are now in a position to calculate the threshold amplitude for the transition\nmechanism (iii) involving only streamwise modes. If we consider the nonlinear terms\nin (A 1) we see that each is of order v2, \u000b2\u00112 or \u000bv\u0011, while the largest nonlinear term\nin (A 2) is of order \u000b\u00112. Hence in (3.23) the nonlinear terms are of order v20 , while\nthe linear part of the equation is of order v0=R. Thus the smallest scaling of v0 which\nallows the nonlinear terms to play a role is v0 = O(R\n\u22121). In (3.24) the nonlinear terms\nare of order Rv20 , but the linear part of the equation is of order v0, which again gives\na threshold amplitude of order R\u22121. Thus the threshold amplitude for a transition\ninvolving only streamwise modes is O(R\u22121) in the L1 norm. Since these modes vary\non an order-one lengthscale in y, the threshold norm for periodic solutions is also\nO(R\u22121).\nThis threshold amplitude for a purely streamwise transition is e\u000bectively contained\nin Benney & Chow (1985), although it is not mentioned explicitly, and they consider\nthe interaction of only two modes in the crosswise direction, z.\nThe reason the threshold is so large even though there is very strong transient\ngrowth of the linearized equations is the weak mutual interaction between streamwise\nmodes, because of the factor of \u000b2 on the right-hand side of (3.23). Much stronger\ncoupling occurs between streamwise modes and oblique modes. Oblique modes also\nexhibit linear transient growth, but it is much weaker than for streamwise modes. Let\nus now examine the transient growth of oblique modes.\n4.2. Transient growth of oblique modes\n4.2.1. wkb analysis of long-time behaviour\nWith \u000bR\u001d1 and the natural wkb ansatz v = \u000bA exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e), \u0011 = B exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e),\nthe natural timescale on which to consider long-time behaviour is t = \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=2\u0016t,\ngiving\n(\u000bR)\u22121=2vyy\u0016t\u2212k2(\u000bR)\u22121=2vt = (\u000bR)\u22121(vyyyy\u22122k2vyy+k4v)\u2212 iU(vyy\u2212k2v)+iU 00v; (4.8)\n(\u000bR)\u22121=2\u0011\u0016t = \u2212i\fU 0v \u2212 iU\u0011 + (\u000bR)\u22121(\u0011yy \u2212 k2\u0011); (4.9)\nso that at leading order\n(\u001ey)\n2\u001e\u0016t = (\u001ey)\n4 \u2212 iU(\u001ey)2; (4.10)\n48 S. J. Chapman\nB\u001e\u0016t = \u2212i\fA\u2212 iUB + B(\u001ey)2: (4.11)\nHowever, we see immediately that (4.10), (4.11) imply A = 0, which implies that our\nscaling for v is incorrect. We must set instead v = \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=2A exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e), so that\nA will appear at the next order in the expansion of the equation for \u0011. This happens\nbecause with the wkb ansatz \u0011 satis\fes the same equation as vyy to leading order,\nwhich is another manifestation of non-normality.\nWriting p = \u001ey , q = \u001et, the eikonal equation (4.10) is\nq \u2212 p2 + iU = 0; (4.12)\nfor which Charpit\u2019s equations are\n_y = \u22122p; _\u0016t = 1; _p = \u2212iU 0; _q = 0; _\u001e = \u22122p2 + q;\nwith initial data\ny0 = s; t0 = 0; p0 = \u001e\n0\n0; q0 = (\u001e\n0\n0)\n2 \u2212 iU(s);\nand solution\nq = (\u001e00)\n2 \u2212 iU(s); (4.13)\n\u0016t = \u001c; (4.14)\np = \u001e00 \u2212 iU 0(s)\u001c; (4.15)\ny = \u22122\u001e00\u001c+ iU 0(s)\u001c2 + s; (4.16)\n\u001e = \u001e0 \u2212 iU(s)\u001c\u2212 (\u001e00)2\u001c+ 2iU 0(s)\u001e00\u001c2 + 2U\n0(s)2\u001c3\n3\n: (4.17)\nSince we are considering subcritical transition, we are interested in parameter values\nfor which all the eigenvalues of (4.1) have negative imaginary part, so that for large\ntimes the solution must decay, i.e. Re(\u001e) ! \u22121 as \u0016t ! 1. The question is to\ndetermine the maximum extent of any transient growth. If Re(\u001e) > Re(\u001e0) for small\ntimes then there is exponentially large transient growth. Expanding the wkb solution\nfor small times we \fnd\n\u001e \u0018 \u001e0(y) + \u0016t((\u001e00)2 \u2212 iU) + \u0016t 2\u001e00(2\u001e00\u001e000 \u2212 iU 0)\n+ 1\n3\n\u0016t3(\u2212(U 0)2 \u2212 6iU 0\u001e00\u001e000 + 12(\u001e00)2(\u001e000)2 + 4(\u001e00)3\u001e0000 ) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 : (4.18)\nNow the norm of the solution is determined by the maximum value of Re(\u001e0).\nSupposing that this is at y = y0, there are two cases to consider.\nSuppose \frst that there is an internal maximum in the solution, so that there is a\nsaddle point of \u001e0 + \u0016\u001e0 at y0, where \u0016\u001e0 is the complex conjugate of \u001e0. Then\n\u001e00(y0) + \u0016\u001e\n0\n0(y0) = 0;\nso that \u001e00(y0) is pure imaginary. Hence the real part of the coe\u000ecient of \u0016t in (4.18)\nis negative, giving exponential decay on an O(\u000b\u22121) timescale (since \u0016t(\u000bR)1=2 = O(1))\nt = O(\u000b\u22121)), unless \u001e00(y0) = 0. In this case the coe\u000ecient of \u0016t 2 is also zero, so that the\nnorm is determined by the \u0016t 3 term, which is \u2212(U 0)2=3. The solution still ultimately\ndecays, but now over a longer timescale \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3 (since \u0016t 3(\u000bR)1=2 = O(1) ) t =\nO(\u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3)).\nNow suppose that the maximum occurs at an endpoint. In this case, in the ray\nsolution (4.13){(4.17) we have to be careful that we do not include irrelevant rays\noriginating from the analytic continuation of the solution outside the domain, which\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 49\nmay lead to spurious exponential growthy. However, when the solution is dominated\nby the endpoint we may do a local analysis in its vicinity, and the solution will be a\ncollection of wall modes (which we will discuss in x 5). These have eigenvalues with\nimaginary part O(\u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3), and have transient growth on this timescale, but only\nexponential decay on the timescale of \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=2.\nIn either case we see that on the timescale of \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=2 there is no transient growth,\nonly exponential decay. The best we can hope for is to make this decay as slow as\npossible, giving a chance for some algebraic transient growth. Suppose therefore, from\nthe discussion earlier, that \u001e00(y0) = 0, so that for small times\nv \u0018 A exp(\u2212(\u000bR)1=2\u0016t3(U 0)2=3):\nTo observe the algebraic growth we should rescale \u0016t with (\u000bR)\u22121=6 so that the new\ntimescale is given by t = \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3~t. Thus we are led to the following key parameter\nregime:\n4.2.2. Transient growth on the timescale of \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3\nWith t = \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3~t we have\n(\u000bR)\u22121=3vyy~t\u2212k2(\u000bR)\u22121=3v~t = (\u000bR)\u22121(vyyyy\u22122k2vyy+k4v)\u2212iU(vyy\u2212k2v)+iU 00v; (4.19)\n(\u000bR)\u22121=3\u0011~t = \u2212i\f\u000b\u22121U 0v \u2212 iU\u0011 + (\u000bR)\u22121(\u0011yy \u2212 k2\u0011): (4.20)\nAs before, v is an order of magnitude smaller than \u0011, so we set v = \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3\nA exp((\u000bR)1=3\u001e), \u0011 = B exp((\u000bR)1=3\u001e). Then at leading order the eikonal equation is\n\u001e~t = \u2212iU.

(1999). This is also true away from the endpoints when we consider\norder-one \u0016t rather than small \u0016t as above.\n50 S. J. Chapman\nNow, A and B blow up as \u001c! 0. The growth is capped when the lower-order terms on\nthe right-hand side of (4.22) become as large as the leading-order terms which were\nretained in (4.24), and therefore cease to be negligible. Let us calculate asymptotically\nhow close \u001c needs to be to zero for this to happen.\nAs \u001c ! 0, the dominant terms on the left-hand side of (4.22) are of order 1=\u001c.\nThe point at which the blow-up occurs is the value of y0 2 [\u22121; 1] which leads to\nthe smallest real value of \u2212i\u001e00(y0)=(\u000bU 0(y0)), which is the blow-up time ~t0. Now,\nif \u001e000(y0)U 0(y0) 6= \u001e00(y0)U 00(y0) then \u001eyy(y0) does not tend to zero as ~t ! ~t0. The\nright-hand side of (4.22) is then of order (\u000bR)\u22121=3=\u001c3 as \u001c ! 0. Hence the neglected\nterms become important when \u001c = (\u000bR)\u22121=6, so that the growth in A is capped at\n(\u000bR)1=3 and in B at (\u000bR)1=6. However, if \u001e000(y0)U 0(y0) = \u001e00(y0)U 00(y0) then \u001eyy is order\n\u001c as \u001c ! 0, and the right-hand side of (4.22) is of order (\u000bR)\u22121=3=\u001c2. In this case\nthe neglected terms become important when \u001c = (\u000bR)\u22121=3, so that the growth in A is\ncapped at (\u000bR)2=3 and in B at (\u000bR)1=3.\nThus there is algebraic transient growth on a timescale of order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3. Note,\nthough, that this transient growth is not of the form tme\u2212t, as would be expected\nfrom a degenerate eigenvalue (that is, a repeated eigenvalue with multiplicity higher\nthan the dimension of its eigenspace), nor of the form e\u2212t \u2212 e\u22122t, which would be\nexpected from a pair of almost parallel eigenvectors, as in the toy model of x 2. The\nfunctions v and \u0011 stay of order \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3 and order one respectively for a time of\norder \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3, then suddenly, over a short (i.e. O(\u000b\u22121)) time, they grow to be orders\n\u000b(\u000bR)1=3 and (\u000bR)1=3 respectively.\nInterpreting the transient growth in terms of eigenfunctions requires us to consider\nnot one or two but all the eigenfunctions. The transient growth occurs because the\nterms in the eigenfunction expansion suddenly all come into phase. The e\u000bect may\nbe illustrated by considering the sum\u2211\nn\nane\ni\u0015nt;\nfor a set of \u2018eigenvalues\u2019 \u0015n which become dense on a line, so that in the limit we\nhave the approximation \u222b\na(\u0015)ei\u0015td\u0015:\nNow if we choose a(\u0015) = e\u2212i\u0015t0 then\u222b\na(\u0015)ei\u0015t d\u0015 \u0018 1\ni(t\u2212 t0) ;\nand there is a blow-up as all the \u2018eigenfunctions\u2019 come into phase at t = t0.\nWe have seen that the maximum growth in A and B occurs when \u001e000(y0)U 0(y0) =\n\u001e00(y0)U 00(y0). However, to compare with numerical results it is interesting to calculate\nthe energy norm of the solution. Before the blow-up time we have\nv \u0018 \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3 a0(y) exp(\u2212(i\u001e0 +U\n0t^)3=(3U 0))\n(i\u001e00 +U 0t^)2\nexp((\u000bR)1=3(\u001e0 \u2212 iUt^)); (4.30)\nwith\nv \u0018 \u2212\u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3 a0(y) exp(i\u001e\n3\n0=(3U\n0))\n(\u001e00)2\nexp((\u000bR)1=3\u001e0) (4.31)\ninitially.

Numerically determined initial condition leading to maximal growth for plane Couette\nflow with \u000b = \f = 1, R = 10 000. The inner lines show the real part of the function, while the\nouter lines show its absolute value. The linearized equations were solved in MATLAB using codes\nwritten by Satish Reddy based a Chebyshev hybrid spectral discretization, as described in Reddy &\nHenningson (1993) and Reddy et al. (1993). The initial condition leading to the maximum transient\ngrowth was determined through a singular value decomposition of exp(At\u0003), where the linearized\nsystem is yt = Ay, and t\n\u0003 is the time at which the norm of exp(At) is maximum.\ny0 which dominates the L\n2 norm of v, and that \u001e0(y)\u2212\u001e0(y0) \u0018 ia(y\u2212y0)+ib(y\u2212y0)2\n\u2212c(y\u2212y0)2n as y ! y0, with a and b real and c not pure imaginary. When performing\nthe method of steepest descents on the L2 norm of the initial condition the dominant\ncontribution comes from a region y \u2212 y0 = O((\u000bR)\u22121=(6n)), giving an L2 norm of v of\norder (\u000bR)\u22121=(6n) times the L1 norm. Now the denominator of v at the blow-up time\nlooks like ((U 00(y0)~t0 \u2212 2b)(y \u2212 y0)\u2212 2nci(y \u2212 y0)2n\u22121)2 as y ! y0. To maximize the L2\nnorm we need to maximize the region over which the denominator is of the order of\n(\u000bR)\u22122=3 (which is the cap as we have seen). Hence we should choose b = U 00(y0)~t0=2,\ngiving y \u2212 y0 = O((\u000bR)\u22121=(6n\u22123)). Hence the maximum L2 norm of v is of the order\nof (\u000bR)\u22121=(6n\u22123) times the maximum L1 norm. Thus we conclude that the growth in\nthe L2 norm is less than that in the L1 norm if the L2 norm of v is dominated by a\nsaddle point of \u001e0 + \u0016\u001e0.\nHowever, we can achieve the same growth in the L2 norm as in the L1 norm if we\ntake \u001e0 to be pure imaginary so that the norm of v is not dominated by a particular\ny0, but each y contributes equally. Then, clearly, to maximize the growth we need the\nblow-up times of all points y to be the same, so that A ! 1 for all y as ~t ! ~t0.\nHence, for maximal growth, we should choose \u001e0 = i~t0U, where ~t0 is real. Even more\nimportantly, we will see later that choosing \u001e0 to be pure imaginary also gives the\nmaximum nonlinear coupling between oblique modes and streamwise modes.\nIn \fgure 4 we show the numerically determined initial condition leading to the\nmaximum transient growth in plane Couette flow for the case \u000b = \f = 1, R = 10 000.\nThe outer lines show the absolute value of the function, while the inner line shows its\nreal part. In \fgure 5 we show the phase of the solution by plotting (\u000bR)\u22121=3 Im(log(v))\nand (\u000bR)\u22121=3 Im(log(\u0011)). We also plot U = y for reference; we see that the numerically\ndetermined maximal initial condition is close to the asymptotic one. In \fgure 6 we\n52 S. J.

However, its precise value is not important for determining the\nscaling of the threshold amplitude.\n4.2.3. Evolution through the blow-up time\nLet us now consider the complete evolution of the solution with an initial condition\nof the form \u001e0 = i~t0U, including the transition through the blow-up region. For times\n0 6 ~t < ~t0 we have\nv \u0018 \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3 a0(y) exp(\u2212(U\n0)2(~t\u2212~t0)3=3)\n(U 0)2(~t\u2212~t0)2 exp(iU(\u000bR)\n1=3(~t0 \u2212~t)); (4.32)\n\u0011 \u0018\n(\ni\fa0(y)\nU 0(~t\u2212~t0) + b0(y)\n)\nexp(\u2212(U 0)2(~t\u2212~t0)3=3) exp(iU(\u000bR)1=3(~t0 \u2212~t)): (4.33)\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 53\nWe have seen that the growth should be capped when ~t\u2212~t0 = O((\u000bR)\u22121=3). We use the\nmethod of matched asymptotic expansions to examine the evolution for ~t close to ~t0.\nWe set ~t = ~t0 + t^(\u000bR)\n\u22121=3, v = \u000b(\u000bR)1=3v^, and \u0011 = (\u000bR)1=3\u0011^.

Since \u00110 is not identically zero, \u0011 remains order (\u000bR)1=3 into the outer\nregion t^ = O((\u000bR)1=3) and decays slowly over this timescale.\n4.2.5. Inner solution for plane Poiseuille flow\nFor plane Poiseuille flow we cannot solve (4.38) analytically. However, the only\npossible behaviour as t^!1 is\nv^ \u0018 v^0(y)\n(U 0)2t^2\ne\u2212iUt^; (4.50)\nfor some v^0(y), so that v^ decays at in\fnity exactly as in plane Couette flow.

For\nplane Poiseuille flow we have no reason to suppose that v^0 = a0 (although we have\nbeen unable to prove v^0 6= a0), and therefore we conjecture that in this case also\n\u0011^0 6= 0.\n4.2.6. Times of order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3 after the maximum\nLet us now consider the \u2018outer\u2019 region again for times beyond the blow-up point.\nWe rescale time again with (\u000bR)1=3.\nFor plane Couette flow v is now order \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3, while \u0011 is still order (\u000bR)1=3, and\nwe conjecture that this is the case for plane Poiseuille flow also. Then v is too small\nto appear in the \u0011-equation at leading order, so that the two equations decouple.\nEquation (4.20) becomes\n(\u000bR)\u22121=3\u0011^~t = \u2212iU\u0011^ + (\u000bR)\u22121(\u0011^yy \u2212 k2\u0011^): (4.52)\nWe use the wkb ansatz \u0011^ = B exp((\u000bR)1=3\u001e) as before. Matching from the \u2018inner\u2019\nblow-up region gives the initial condition at ~t = ~t0 as \u001e = 0, B = \u00110.

Note that\nduring the decay \u0011 begins to oscillate rapidly again, so that its derivative is O((\u000bR)2=3).\nIn \fgure 7 we show a numerical simulation of the evolution of the maximum of\nthe velocity and vorticity for the numerically determined initial condition leading to\nmaximum transient growth in plane Couette flow with \u000b = \f = 1 and R = 100 000.\nWe see that this reproduces the qualitative features of the asymptotic solution, namely\nthat v stays small for a long time, suddenly becomes large, and then just as suddenly\nreturns to be small again, whereas \u0011 stays small for a long time, suddenly becomes\nlarge, and then slowly decays back to zero. Notice that the time that \u0011 reaches its\nmaximum is delayed slightly behind the time that v reaches its maximum. This is\nbecause \u0011 is e\u000bectively the time integral of v (see (4.40)). This delay is O(\u000b\u22121) as\n\u000bR !1.\nIn \fgure 8 we show v at the time it has reached its maximum value. The real part\nof v is shown; the imaginary part is zero. Notice that v is not oscillatory, in agreement\nwith the asymptotics.\n4.3. Asymptotically large \f\nFor completeness we should determine the extent of the transient growth in the case\nwhen \f is asymptotically large in R. Since this case turns out to be not relevant for\nthe optimal routes to transition we omit the details and simply give an indication of\nthe results.\nThe case of large \f seems promising at \frst, since (4.29) indicates that as \f increases\nthe scaling \u0011 increases relative to v, which is one cause of the transient growth.

The real part of v\nis shown; the imaginary part is zero.\ncanonical case to consider is \f = R1=3\u0016\f, with \u0016\f of order one. Besides changing the\nrelative scalings of v and \u0011 this has the e\u000bect of changing the denominator in (4.28)\nfrom \u001c2 to \u001c2 + \u0016\f2 (as well as modifying the exponential decay). However, this means\nthat the growth in v is smaller, since the double pole has split into two simple poles.\nThe result is a transient growth of order R1=3 in \u0011, which is comparable to that when\n\f is of order one. However, to achieve this growth requires \u001e00(y) to have real part\nequal to \u0006\u0016\f (so that \u001c2 + \u0016\f2 reaches zero for real ~t). Hence the optimally growing\ninitial condition is localized near the wall. We will see that this localization leads to a\nsmaller coupling with the streamwise modes, so we do not need to consider the case\nof large \f further.\n4.4. Summary\nWe have now determined the answers to questions (i) and (ii) of x 3, namely we have\ndetermined the extent of the transient growth in both streamwise and oblique modes.\nIn the next section we will examine the eigenvalues of the linearized equations, but\nwe \frst summarize our results so far.\nStreamwise modes: \u000b of order 1=R\nThe streamwise modes exhibit a maximum transient growth of order R over a\ntimescale of order R. They vary on an order-one lengthscale in y.\nOblique modes: \u000bR \u001d 1\nThe oblique mode with the largest transient growth has an initial condition of the\nform\nv0 \u0018 \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3~v(y) exp(iU(\u000bR)1=3~t0); (4.57)\n\u00110 \u0018 ~\u0011(y) exp(iU(\u000bR)1=3~t0): (4.58)\nOn a timescale of \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3 this mode varies on a lengthscale of (\u000bR)\u22121=3 in y. The\nnorm of the solution stays order one for times of order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3, then suddenly\n(over an O(\u000b\u22121) time) v and \u0011 grow to be of order \u000b(\u000bR)1=3 and (\u000bR)1=3 respectively,\nceasing to oscillate rapidly in y at the same time. Just as suddenly, v returns to being\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 57\nof order \u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3, but \u0011 stays of order (\u000bR)1=3, decaying slowly over a timescale\n\u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3, and oscillating rapidly in y on a lengthscale (\u000bR)\u22121=3 again.\nIn fact the transient growth we have found for \u000bR \u001d 1 matches smoothly into that\nfor \u000bR \u0018 1 for small \u000b. The timescale for the growth is \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3, and the maximum\ngrowth of the norm is \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3. The maximum growth occurs for \u000b = O(1=R), as\nwe mentioned earlier. However, we will see that we must choose \u000b = O(1) in order to\nmaximize the generation of a streamwise mode through the nonlinear terms while an\noblique mode is growing and decaying.\n5. Eigenvalues of the linearized equations\nHere we determine the position of the eigenvalues of the linearized equations\nasymptotically as R ! 1. This will enable us to determine how large a streamwise\nstreak has to be in order to signi\fcantly perturb the eigenvalues, and in particular to\nmake an eigenvalue become unstable.\nSince all the eigenvalues of the base flow we consider are stable, there has been\nlittle interest in their asymptotic approximation (in contrast to the analysis of the\nneutral curve for plane Poiseuille flow, on which there is a vast literature). The\nasymptotic analysis that has been performed usually solves the equation in terms\nof special functions (generalized Airy functions for plane Couette flow), formulates\nthe characteristic equation, and then approximates for large values of the Reynolds\nnumber (Drazin & Reid 1981). This approach makes it quite di\u000ecult to see where\nthe scalings of the di\u000berent classes of eigenvalues come from, and hard to see how\nthese eigenvalues would be perturbed by perturbing the equations.\nThe approach we take here is rather to approximate the equation for large values\nof the Reynolds number, \fnd approximate solutions, and then apply the boundary\nconditions to determine the eigenvalues. This makes it very easy to see how the\neigenvalues will be a\u000bected by perturbations, but it does mean that we have to take\ncareful account of Stokes phenomenon. Some of the results of this section we believe\nto be new (or at least presented in a new way), while others are very well known;\nhowever, in both cases the crucial question we will address is how large a streamwise\nstreak has to be in order to signi\fcantly a\u000bect the calculation.\nIn a common notation, we de\fne the eigenvalues through the relationship\nv\u000b\f(y; t) = e\u2212i\u000b\u0015t\u0016v\u000b\f(y);\nso that a positive imaginary part of an eigenvalue \u0015 corresponds to instability.

The modes with eigenvalues with\nimaginary part O((\u000bR)\u22121=3) are wall modes concentrated in a region of order (\u000bR)\u22121=3\nfrom the boundary, as in plane Couette flow. The new modes with eigenvalues having\nimaginary component O((\u000bR)\u22121=2) are \u2018centre modes\u2019; these are localized in a region\nof order (\u000bR)\u22121=4 around the centre of the channel.\nFor plane Poiseuille flow the even and odd modes decouple and may be considered\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 59\nindependently if necessary, with the boundary conditions at either y = 1 or y = \u22121\nbeing replaced with v = v00 = \u00110 = 0 or v0 = v000 = \u0011 = 0 at y = 0 for even and odd\nmodes respectively.\nFor R > Rc \u0019 5772:2 one of the even wall modes in plane Poiseuille flow has a\npositive imaginary part (the Tollmien{Schlichting wave, \u000bc \u0019 1:021, \fc = 0) corre-\nsponding to linear instability. However, we will \fnd that the centre modes are the\nmodes which exhibit the secondary instability involved in the routes to transition (i)\nand (ii) discussed in the Introduction.\nLet us \frst show how the position of the eigenvalues can be determined asymp-\ntotically from (5.1){(5.2), in the limit \u000bR ! 1; we will then consider how large\na streamwise streak has to be for the nonlinear terms on the right-hand side of\n(3.23){(3.24) to a\u000bect this calculation.\nWe start with the eigenvalues which have order-one imaginary component. These\nare the most di\u000ecult to approximate, but they have received the least attention in\nthe literature since they are all strongly stable. The following analysis is essentially an\ninterpretation and extension of that by Morawetz (1952).\nOf the eigenvalues which have order-one imaginary component, the Squire modes\nare the easiest to deal with, so we will examine them \frst.\n5.1. Squire eigenvalues with order-one imaginary component\nAlthough for plane Couette flow we can solve the equation exactly in terms of Airy\nfunctions and then approximate the characteristic equations, we prefer to approximate\nthe solutions of the equation directly, since this makes the e\u000bect of a perturbation\nmore transparent. With v = 0 the asymptotic solutions of (5.2) as \u000bR ! 1 are of\nwkb form. Setting\n\u0011 = B exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e); (5.3)\nwe \fnd that at leading order\n\u2212i\u0015B + iUB \u2212 \u001e2yB = 0; (5.4)\nso that\n\u001e = \u0006ei\u0019=4\n\u222b\n(U \u2212 \u0015)1=2 dy: (5.5)\nAt next order we \fnd\n2\u001eyBy + \u001eyyB = 0;\nso that\nB =\n1\n\u001e\n1=2\ny\n: (5.6)\nWe will show that the leading-order position of the eigenvalues is determined purely\nby the phase \u001e of these wkb solutions. In the following discussion the boundary\ny = \u22121 should be replaced by y = 0 if we are dealing with plane Poiseuille rather\nthan plane Couette flow.\nIf the solution of (5.5) is such that the real part of \u001e has a turning point in the\ninterval (\u22121; 1) (as we will see that it is) then the eigenmode will be approximately\nequal to the wkb solution for which the real part of \u001e has a maximum (call this phase\n\u001e and the wkb approximation \u00111), which is exponentially small at the boundaries by\ncomparison to its value in the interior. Let us start with this solution and consider how\nto add multiples of the other solution (with phase \u2212\u001e; call this wkb approximation\n60 S. J.

The subdominant wkb\napproximation is \u2018switched o\u000b\u2019 across the Stokes lines (solid), while the dominance of the two wkb\napproximations switches across the anti-Stokes lines (dashed).\n\u00112) in order to satisfy the boundary conditions (if there is no turning point in the real\npart of \u001e in the interval (\u22121; 1) then we may start with either wkb solution).\nSuppose \frst that Re(\u001e(\u22121)) > Re(\u001e(1)), so that \u00111(\u22121) exponentially dominates\n\u00111(1). Then we can ignore the boundary condition at y = 1, but we must add an\nO(exp(2(\u000bR)1=2\u001e(\u22121))) multiple of \u00112 in order to satisfy the boundary condition at\ny = \u22121. However, this additional multiple of \u00112 will exponentially dominate \u00111 at\ny = 1, since its phase there is (\u000bR)1=2(2\u001e(\u22121)\u2212\u001e(1)) which has real part greater than\nthat of \u001e(1). The only way out of this conundrum is that \u00112 is switched o\u000b via Stokes\nphenomenon as we cross a Stokes line somewhere between y = \u22121 and y = +1.\nNow, locally near the turning points in the complex plane where \u001ey = 0, \u001e has\na three-halves power singularity and the Stokes line structure is that of the Airy\nequation. We require the solution which has only a single subdominant wkb solution\n\u00111 in the phase sector containing y = 1, which is shown schematically in \fgure 11.\nAs we cross the Stokes line Im(\u001e) = 0 the other wkb approximation \u00112 is turned on,\nand is present to help us satisfy the boundary condition at y = \u22121. However, to do\nso it must have grown to be exactly the same size as \u00111 there, i.e. y = \u22121 must lie on\nthe anti-Stokes line (in agreement with the results of Morawetz 1952).\nIf Re(\u001e(\u22121)) > Re(\u001e(1)) this gives eigenvalues lying on the upper left-hand branch\nof the \u2018Y\u2019 in \fgure 14. If Re(\u001e(1)) > Re(\u001e(\u22121)) then the structure of the Stokes lines\nis as shown schematically in \fgure 12, which gives eigenvalues lying on the upper\nright-hand branch of the Y in \fgure 14.\nThe \fnal case to consider is the possibility that Re(\u001e(\u22121)) = Re(\u001e(1)). In this case\nan exponentially large multiple of the solution shown in \fgure 13(b) can be added to\nthe solution shown in \fgure 13(a) to satisfy the boundary conditions at both y = \u00061.\nThis is possible so long as the right-hand anti-Stokes line in \fgure 13(a) does not\ncross \u22121 < y < 1, and gives the stem of the \u2018Y\u2019 in \fgure 14.\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 61\nIm(y)\nRe(y)1\u20131\ndd\ns\ns\nd\nd\ns\ns\nFigure 12.

Finally, the condition that Re(\u001e(1)) = Re(\u001e(\u22121)) is Re(\u0015) = 0.\nIn \fgure 14 we show the asymptotic lines that the Squire eigenvalues must lie on\nas R ! 1, along with the Squire eigenvalues for R = 2000, \u000b = \f = 1. If we were\ninterested in the exact position of the eigenvalues it is a simple matter to determine\nthese using the wkb solutions. However for our present purposes the lines are enough.\n5.1.2.

Note that\nthe odd and even modes are interspersed on the right-hand and lower branches, but\nare almost identical on the left-hand branch. Indeed they cannot be distinguished\ngraphically; each point in \fgure 15 represents both an even and an odd mode. This\nis because the odd and even modes satisfy di\u000berent boundary conditions at y = 0,\nbut the same boundary conditions at y = 1.\n5.1.3. Perturbing the eigenvalues\nWe can now determine how large a streamwise streak, \u00110\f1 say, has to be in order\nto perturb the Squire eigenvalues with imaginary component of order one. Equation\n(3.24) becomes\nL\n\u000b\f\n2 (\u0011\n\u000b\f; v\u000b\f) =\n\u2211\n\f1+\f2=\f\nN\n0\f1\u000b\f2\n2 (v\n0\f1 ; \u00110\f1 ; v\u000b\f2 ; \u0011\u000b\f2 ); (5.8)\nwhere the right-hand side is linear in v\u000b\f2 , \u0011\u000b\f2 . Since the unperturbed eigenvalues all\nlie on the anti-Stokes line of the two wkb solutions, they will only be perturbed at\nleading order if the perturbation added on the right-hand side of (5.8) changes the\n64 S. J. Chapman\nphase \u001e of the wkb solutions, that is, the terms on the right-hand side of (5.8) have\nto be big enough to appear in equation (5.4). Now the left-hand side of equation (5.8)\nis O(\u000b\u0011), while the right-hand side is O(\u00110\f1\u000b\u0011). Hence the phase of the wkb solutions\nwill be modi\fed only if \u00110\f1 = O(1). Note that when this happens the equations\n(5.8) are all coupled in the crosswise direction z, even though they still decouple\nin the streamwise direction x. Thus the instability generated is a three-dimensional\ninstability of a now three-dimensional base flow (in contrast to the three-dimensional\ninstability of a two-dimensional base flow considered by Orszag & Patera 1983).\nLet us now determine the position of the Orr{Sommerfeld eigenvalues with order-\none imaginary component.\n5.2. Orr{Sommerfeld eigenvalues with order-one imaginary component\nThe asymptotic solutions of (5.1) comprise two inviscid solutions and two wkb\nsolutions. To leading order the inviscid solutions satisfy\ni\u0015(vyy \u2212 k2v)\u2212 iU(vyy \u2212 k2v) + iU 00v = 0; (5.9)\n\u2212i\u0015\u0011 + iU\u0011 + i\f\n\u000b\nU 0v = 0; (5.10)\nwhile, setting\nv = A exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e); \u0011 = B exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e); (5.11)\nwe \fnd that at leading order the wkb solutions satisfy\ni\u0015\u001e2y \u2212 iU\u001e2y + \u001e4y = 0; (5.12)\n\u2212i\u0015B + iUB + i\f\n\u000b\nU 0A\u2212 \u001e2yB = 0: (5.13)\nHence the two wkb solutions again have\n\u001e = \u0006ei\u0019=4\n\u222b\n(U \u2212 \u0015)1=2 dy; (5.14)\nand we see that (5.13) implies that A = 0, so that the relative scaling of v and \u0011 in\n(5.11) is wrong, and in fact we should have\nv = (\u000bR)\u22121=2A exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e); \u0011 = B exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e): (5.15)\nAt next order we \fnd\n2Ay\u001ey + 5A\u001eyy = 0;\n2\u001eyBy + \u001eyyB = i\n\f\n\u000b\nU 0A;\nso that\nA = (\u001ey)\n\u22125=2; (5.16)\nB = \u001e\u22121=2y\n\u222b\n\fiU 0A\n2\u000b\u001e\n1=2\ny\ndy: (5.17)\nWe label the two wkb approximations, v3 and v4, such that\nv3 \u0018 \u001e\u22125=2y exp((\u000bR)1=2\u001e); (5.18)\nv4 \u0018 \u001e\u22125=2y exp(\u2212(\u000bR)1=2\u001e); (5.19)\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 65\nwhere the sign of \u001e is chosen as before such that Re(\u001e) > 0 where Im(\u001e) = 0 with\ny real, so that v3 exponentially dominates v4 there. We will label the two inviscid\napproximations, v1 and v2, shortly.\nThe position of the Orr{Sommerfeld eigenvalues is determined by Stokes phe-\nnomenon, as with the Squire modes. However, in this case, since there are four\nlinearly independent solutions of the equation rather than two, there are many more\nStokes switchings which are possible, and we need to take account of each of them.\nEach of the two inviscid solutions may turn on a multiple of the subdominant wkb\napproximation across the Stokes line Im(\u001e) = 0, while the dominant wkb approxi-\nmation may turn on multiples of the inviscid solutions, as well as a multiple of the\nsubdominant wkb solution.\nSince plane Couette flow turns out to be much simpler than plane Poiseuille flow,\nwe treat the flows separately, starting with Couette.\n5.2.1. Plane Couette flow\nFor plane Couette flow two independent inviscid solutions are eky , and e\u2212ky . In fact\nthese are exact solutions to (5.1), so that there is no Stokes line switching associated\nwith them.\nWe now build up an eigenfunction as follows. Consider \frst an eigenvalue in the\nleft half-plane. Then v4(1) exponentially dominates v4(\u22121) and v3(1).\nTherefore, in the vicinity of y = 1, we may take a suitable linear combination\nof the two inviscid approximations and the wkb approximation v4 to satisfy the\ntwo boundary conditions there. Since v04 = O((\u000bR)1=2v4), to leading order the inviscid\nsolutions will satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition, and an exponentially small\namount of v4, of order (\u000bR)\n\u22121=2 exp(\u2212(\u000bR)1=2Re(\u001e(1)), will be added to satisfy the\nNeumann condition.\nNow let us consider the boundary conditions at y = \u22121. We still have the freedom\nto add a multiple of the solution shown schematically in \fgure 11, which approximates\nto v3 near y = 1 and is therefore negligible there. We must adjust the coe\u000ecient of\nthis solution and the eigenvalue \u0015 in order to satisfy the two boundary conditions at\ny = \u22121.\nHowever, as well as the dominant wkb approximation v3 switching on a multiple\nof the subdominant wkb approximation v4 across the Stokes line arg(y\u2212 \u0015) = \u0019=2, it\nalso switches on multiples of the two inviscid solutions.\nIf we de\fne the two inviscid solutions by their asymptotic behaviour as y ! \u0015, so\nthat\nv1 \u0018 1; v2 \u0018 y \u2212 \u0015\nas y ! \u0015 then the Stokes multiplier of the \frst is O((\u000bR)5=12), while that of the second\nis O((\u000bR)3=4). This can be deduced easily using the techniques in Chapman et al.\n(1998). Thus, as we cross the Stokes line as we move from y = 1 to y = \u22121 we \fnd\nv3 ! v3 + av4 + (\u000bR)3=4bv2 + (\u000bR)5=12cv1;\nwhere the constants a, b and c are order one. It is possible to calculate the constants\na, b and c, but we leave them unspeci\fed since their exact value is unimportant for\nour present purposes. Then, if at y = +1 our solution is approximated by\nA^v1 + B^v2 + v3 + C^v4\n(where v3 is negligible near y = 1 and C^v4 is negligible near y = \u22121) then at y = \u22121,\n66 S. J.

Thus in this case we are not exactly on the anti-Stokes line,\nbut very close to it. With v3 = O((\u000bR)\n1=4) we \fnd Re(\u001e) = (\u000bR)\u22121=2(log \u000bR)=4, while for\nv4 = O((\u000bR)\n1=4) we must have Re(\u001e) = \u2212(\u000bR)\u22121=2(log \u000bR)=4. Thus the eigenvalues lie\non two lines, one either side of the anti-Stokes line, with a di\u000berent wkb exponential\ndominant on each.\nAn alternative scenario is that the two wkb solutions are again of the same size at\ny = \u00061, as with the Squire modes, so that there are also Orr{Sommerfeld modes on\nthe stem of the \u2018Y\u2019.\nIn \fgure 16 we show the curves Re(\u001e) = \u0006(\u000bR)\u22121=2(log \u000bR)=4, and Re(\u001e(\u22121)) =\nRe(\u001e(1)), along with the numerically determined Orr{Sommerfeld eigenvalues for\nR = 2000, \u000b = \f = 1.\n5.2.2. Plane Poiseuille flow\nWith plane Poiseuille flow the inviscid solutions are not so simple, and we have\nthe added complication that these solutions themselves exhibit Stokes phenomenon,\nswitching on a multiple of the subdominant wkb solution.\nLet us de\fne the two inviscid solutions, v1 and v2 say, through their asymptotic\nbehaviour as y ! i(\u0015\u2212 1), so that\nv1 \u0018 1\u2212 i\n(\u0015\u2212 1)1=2 (y \u2212 i(\u0015\u2212 1)\n1=2) log(y \u2212 i(\u0015\u2212 1)1=2); (5.22)\nv2 \u0018 y \u2212 i(\u0015\u2212 1)1=2; (5.23)\nas y ! i(\u0015 \u2212 1)1=2. We label the two wkb solutions as before. Now as we cross the\nStokes line Im(\u001e) = 0, from left to right,\nv3 ! v3 + av4 + b(\u000bR)3=4v2 + c(\u000bR)5=12v1;\nv1 ! v1 + d(\u000bR)\u22123=4v4;\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 67\nwith a, b, c and d of order one, while there is no Stokes jump associated with v2.\nAgain, the techniques of Chapman et al. (1998) can be used to determine the size of\nthe Stokes multiplier in v1 easily.\nLet us \frst examine the family of eigenvalues lying on the right-hand branch of the\n\u2018Y\u2019 in \fgure 10, which become centre modes for small Im(\u0015). We start with a solution\nnear y = \u22121 which is approximated by\nv \u0018 A^v1 + B^v2 + v3 + C^v4;\nwhere C^v4 is exponentially negligible at y = 0, while v3 is exponentially negligible\nat y = \u22121. Then we choose A^, B^ and C^ to satisfy the two boundary conditions at\ny = \u22121. Since v04 = O((\u000bR)1=2v4), to leading-order A^ and B^ are chosen to satisfy the\nDirichlet boundary condition, with an exponentially small amount of v4, of order\n(\u000bR)\u22121=2 exp(\u2212(\u000bR)1=2Re(\u001e(\u22121)), added to satisfy the Neumann condition.\nThen, at y = 0, having crossed the Stokes line, we have\nv \u0018 A^v1 + A^d(\u000bR)\u22123=4v4 + B^v2 + v3 + av4 + b(\u000bR)3=4v2 + c(\u000bR)5=12v1 + C^v4:\nFor the odd modes we need to satisfy v = v00 = 0 at y = 0. Hence\nA^v1 + (B^ + b(\u000bR)\n3=4)v2 + (\u001e\n0)\u22125=2e(\u000bR)\n1=2\u001e + (a+ A^d(\u000bR)\u22123=4)e\u2212(\u000bR)\n1=2\u001e \u0018 0; (5.24)\nA^v001 + (B^ + b(\u000bR)\n3=4)v002 + (\u001e\n0)\u22121=2\u000bR e(\u000bR)\n1=2\u001e\n+(a+ A^d(\u000bR)\u22123=4)(\u001e0)\u22121=2\u000bR e\u2212(\u000bR)\n1=2\u001e \u0018 0: (5.25)\nSince we have already determined A^ to be the same order as B^, and since b is O(1),\n(5.24) implies that A^ and B^ are O((\u000bR)3=4). Then (5.25) is dominated by at least one\nof the wkb solutions, so that if there is to be a balance they must be of the same size,\ni.e. the eigenvalue must again lie on the anti-Stokes line.\nFor the even modes we have v0 = v000 = 0 at y = 0. Hence\nA^v01 + (B^ + b(\u000bR)\n3=4)v02 + (\u000bR)\n1=2(\u001e0)\u22123=2e(\u000bR)\n1=2\u001e\n\u2212(a+ A^d(\u000bR)\u22123=4)(\u000bR)1=2(\u001e0)\u22123=2e\u2212(\u000bR)1=2\u001e \u0018 0; (5.26)\nA^v0001 + (B^ + b(\u000bR)\n3=4)v0002 + (\u001e\n0)1=2(\u000bR)3=2e(\u000bR)\n1=2\u001e\n\u2212(a+ A^d(\u000bR)\u22123=4)(\u001e0)1=2(\u000bR)3=2e\u2212(\u000bR)1=2\u001e \u0018 0: (5.27)\nAgain, since we have already determined A^ and B^ to be the same order, and since b is\nO(1), (5.26) implies that A^ and B^ are O((\u000bR)3=4). Then, as before, (5.27) is dominated\nby at least one of the wkb solutions, and implies that the eigenvalue must lie on the\nanti-Stokes line.\nLet us now examine the family of eigenvalues lying on the left-hand branch of the\n\u2018Y\u2019 in \fgure 10, which become wall modes for small Im(\u0015). We start with a solution\nnear y = 0 which is approximated by\nv \u0018 A^v1 + B^v2 + v3 + C^v4;\nwhere C^v4 is exponentially negligible at y = \u22121, while v3 is exponentially negligible at\ny = 0. Then we choose A^, B^ and C^ to satisfy the two boundary conditions at y = 0.\nSince v04 = O((\u000bR)1=2v4), to leading order A^ and B^ are chosen to satisfy boundary\nconditions containing derivatives of lowest order, with an exponentially small amount\nof v4, added to satisfy the other condition.\n68 S.

Then,\nas for plane Couette flow, the only way to satisfy the boundary conditions is for\ne\u0006(\u000bR)1=2\u001e = O((\u000bR)1=4), i.e. one of v3 or v4 must be O((\u000bR)1=4). Thus again we are close\nto the anti-Stokes line, with Re(\u001e) = \u0006(\u000bR)\u22121=2(log(\u000bR))=4.\nFinally, for the stem modes, v3 and v4 are the same size at y = 0 and y = \u22121, so\nthat asymptotically these eigenvalues lie on the same line as the the Squire modes.\nIn \fgures 17 and 18 we show the lines Re(\u001e) = \u0006 (\u000bR)\u22121=2(log \u000bR)=4, and\nRe(\u001e(\u22121)) = Re(\u001e(0)), along with the numerically determined Orr{Sommerfeld eigen-\nvalues for R = 5000, \u000b = \f = 1.\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 69\nNote that the agreement between the asymptotic lines and the numerical value\nof the eigenvalues is poor for the even Orr{Sommerfeld eigenvalues lying on the\nleft-hand branches of the \u2018Y\u2019. The reason for this is that when A^ and B^ are chosen to\nsatisfy the leading-order behaviour in (5.28), namely\nA^v1 + (B^ \u2212 b(\u000bR)3=4)v2 \u0018 0;\nthen\nA^v01 + (B^ \u2212 b(\u000bR)3=4)v02\nis close to zero, so that the eigenvalues are pushed closer to the anti-Stokes line. We\nshow why this is so in Appendix B.\nThe eigenvalues on the right-hand branch of the \u2018Y\u2019 are almost equal for the odd\nand even modes. This has been commented on before Drazin & Reid (1981), but\nas yet remains unexplained. The present analysis can be developed to explain this\ncoincidence; we defer this discussion to Appendix C.\nHaving determined the asymptotic position of the Orr{Sommerfeld eigenvalues\nwith order-one imaginary component, we can now determine the size of streamwise\nstreak, \u00110\f1 , necessary to signi\fcantly perturb these eigenvalues.\n5.2.3. Perturbing the eigenvalues\nAfter the growth of a streamwise streak, equation (3.23) becomes\nL\n\u000b\f\n1 (\u0011\n\u000b\f; v\u000b\f) =\n\u2211\n\f1+\f2=\f\nN\n0\f1\u000b\f2\n1 (v\n0\f1 ; \u00110\f1 ; v\u000b\f2 ; \u0011\u000b\f2 ); (5.30)\nwhere the right-hand side is linear in v\u000b\f2 , \u0011\u000b\f2 . Now, the key fact to emerge from the\npreceding analysis is that, as with the Squire modes, to leading order the eigenvalues\nall lie on the anti-Stokes lines associated with the wkb solutions, and therefore their\nposition depends only on the phase of these solutions, \u001e. Hence the eigenvalues will\nbe perturbed at leading order only if the terms on the right-hand side of (5.30) are\nbig enough to appear in equation (5.12).\nNow, under the wkb approximation, the left-hand side of equation (5.30) is O(\u000b2Rv),\nwhile the right-hand side is O(\u00110\f1\u000b2Rv) (since \u0011 = O((\u000bR)1=2v=\u000b)). Hence the phase\nof the wkb solutions will be modi\fed when \u00110\f1 = O(1).\nAs with the Squire modes, once the streak is big enough to perturb the eigenvalues\nthe equations (5.30) are all coupled in the crosswise direction z, even though they still\ndecouple in the streamwise direction x, so that the base flow is three-dimensional.\nThus far we have dealt with all the eigenvalues with order-one imaginary compo-\nnent. The eigenvalues with small imaginary component must be treated separately,\nand because of their slow decay rate have received more attention in the literature.\nFor those with the anti-Stokes line passing through y = \u00061 all the action takes place\nnear the boundary, so that they are known as wall modes, while for those with the\nanti-Stokes line passing through y = 0 (for plane Poiseuille flow) all the action takes\nplace near the centreline, and they are known as centre modes.\n5.3. Wall modes in plane Couette flow\nFor the wall modes near y = \u22121 (for example) the correct scaling is y = \u22121 +\n\u000b\u22121=3R\u22121=3\u0016y, \u0015 = \u22121 + \u000b\u22121=3R\u22121=3\u0016\u0015 (see, for example Corcos & Sellars 1959; Gill\n1965), giving\ni\u0016\u0015v\u0016y\u0016y \u2212 i\u0016yv\u0016y\u0016y + v\u0016y\u0016y\u0016y\u0016y = 0; (5.31)\ni\u0016\u0015\u0011 \u2212 i\u0016y\u0011 + \u0011\u0016y\u0016y = i(\u000bR)\n1=3\fv\n\u000b\n: (5.32)\n70 S. J. Chapman\nNow, the outer inviscid solutions can be determined as before, and satisfy the Dirichlet\ncondition at y = 1 to leading order. Hence the normalised outer solution away from\nthe wall is\nv = sinh(y + 1):\nAs y ! \u22121 this gives\nv \u0018 \u2212 sinh 2 + R\u22121=3\u0016y cosh 2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 :\nHence the boundary conditions on (5.31){(5.32) are\nv = v\u0016y = \u0011 = 0 on \u0016y = 0; (5.33)\nv ! \u2212 sinh 2; \u0011 ! 0 as \u0016y !1: (5.34)\nThe sinh 2 here simply determines the relative scaling of the eigenfunction in the outer\ninviscid and inner wall regions; all that is important is that this factor is non-zero.\nEquation (5.31) can easily be solved in terms of generalized Airy functions, and (5.32)\nin terms of Airy functions, to give expressions for the eigenvalues. However, for our\npresent purposes all that is important is the scaling.\n5.3.1. Perturbation of the wall-mode eigenvalues in Couette flow\nLet us now determine how large a streamwise streak has to be to perturb the\nwall-mode eigenvalues. There are two ways that this can be performed: we can\neither modify equations (5.31) and (5.32), or we can modify the boundary conditions\n(5.33) and (5.34). To modify the boundary conditions, we need to modify the inviscid\nsolutions. For these the left-hand side of (3.23) is O(\u000bv), while the right-hand side is\nO(\u00110\f1\u000b2\u0011). Since v = O(\u000b\u0011) for the inviscid solutions, these will be modi\fed when\n\u00110\f1 is O(1).\nNow in the inner region near the wall the left-hand side of (3.23) is O(\u000b(\u000bR)1=3v),\nwhile the right-hand side is O(\u00110\f1\u000b2(\u000bR)1=3\u0011). Since v = O(\u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3\u0011) in the wall\nregion, this means the right-hand side will be in the leading-order balance when \u00110\f1 is\nO((\u000bR)\u22121=3). However, we must remember that \u00110\f1 varies on an order-one lengthscale\nin y, and must vanish at the boundary, so that in the inner wall region it takes values\norder (\u000bR)\u22121=3 smaller than in the bulk of the flow. Thus to achieve a value of \u00110\f1\nof order (\u000bR)\u22121=3 in the wall region requires a streamwise streak of order one in the\nbulk.\nFor the Squire wall modes, the left-hand side of (3.24) is O(\u000b(\u000bR)\u22121=3\u0011), while the\nright-hand side is O(\u00110\f1\u000b\u0011). Again, this means that \u00110\f1 must be O((\u000bR)\u22121=3) in the\nwall region, and therefore O(1) in the bulk of the flow.\n5.4. Wall modes in plane Poiseuille flow\nFor the wall modes near y = \u22121 (for example) the correct scaling is (see, for example\nCorcos & Sellars 1959; Gill 1965), y = \u22121 + \u000b\u22121=3R\u22121=3\u0016y, \u0015 = \u000b\u22121=3R\u22121=3\u0016\u0015, giving\ni\u0016\u0015vyy \u2212 2i\u0016yvyy + vyyyy = 0; (5.35)\ni\u0016\u0015\u0011 \u2212 2i\u0016y\u0011 + \u0011yy = i(\u000bR)\n1=3\fv\n\u000b\n: (5.36)\nNow in this case the outer inviscid solutions satisfy\n(1\u2212 y2)(vyy \u2212 k2v) + 2v = 0; (5.37)\n\u000b(1\u2212 y2)\u0011 = 2\fyv; (5.38)\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 71\nto leading order. Now, as y ! \u22121,\nv \u0018 c1(1 + (y + 1) log(y + 1)) + c2\n(\n(1 + y) +\n(1 + y)2\n2\n+ \u0001 \u0001 \u0001\n)\n;\nfor some c1 and c2. Hence, providing c1 6= 0, the boundary conditions on (5.35){(5.36)\nare\nv = v\u0016y = \u0011 = 0 on \u0016y = 0;\nv ! c1; \u0011 ! 0 as \u0016y !1:\nHence, for c1 of order one, the eigenvalues are the same as for plane Couette flow\n(once the wall shear has been normalised); in particular they are all stable, and a\nbulk streamwise streak of order one is required to perturb them at leading order.\nThe di\u000berence between the stability characteristics of plane Couette flow and plane\nPoiseuille flow arises because for small \u000b and \f it turns out that c1 \u0018 0 for the even\nmodes. There is a vast amount of literature on the neutral stability curve for plane\nPoiseuille flow, and we do not delve into it here, since it is peripheral for our purposes\n(but refer the reader to the extensive discussion in Drazin & Reid 1981). However,\nwe do indicate very briefly how the scalings arise from the present analysis.\n5.4.1. Small \u000b and \f; lower branch of the marginal stability curve\nWhen \u000b! 0 (but \u000bR \u001d 1), and with \f = 0, the outer inviscid solutions satisfy\n(1\u2212 y2)vyy + 2v = 0; (5.39)\nat leading order in \u000b, with even solution\nv = 1\u2212 y2 (5.40)\nand odd solution\nv = y + (1\u2212 y2) tanh\u22121 y: (5.41)\nNow, for the even solution, c1 = 0 and\nv \u0018 2(1 + y)\u2212 (1 + y)2\nas y ! \u22121. The boundary conditions on (5.35){(5.36) then depend on the relative\nscaling of R and \u000b. For the even modes the \frst-order correction term to (5.40)\nsatis\fes\n(1\u2212 y2)vyy + 2v + \u000b2(1\u2212 y2)2 \u2212 2\u0015 = 0;\nwith even solution\nv =\n\u000b2\n30\n(y2(3y2 \u2212 11) + 4(1\u2212 y2) log(1\u2212 y2)) + \u0015:\nHence as y ! \u22121,\nv \u0018 2(1 + y) + \u0015\u2212 4\u000b\n2\n15\n+ \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 : (5.42)\nThe canonical scaling for \u000b so that both these terms appear in the boundary conditions\non the inner eigenvalue problem is such that in the inner scaling 1 + y = O(\u000b2), i.e.\n\u000b = O(R\u22121=7). Note that \u0015 is then also of the same order as \u000b2. The boundary\nconditions on the inner problem (5.35){(5.36) are then\nv = v\u0016y = \u0011 = 0 on \u0016y = 0;\nv \u0018 2\u0016y + \u0016\u0015\u2212 4(\u000b\n7R)1=3\n15\n; \u0011 ! 0 as \u0016y !1:\n72 S. J. Chapman\nHowever, when we apply these boundary conditions we \fnd that there is an unstable\neigenvalue for all \u000b greater than a critical value. Thus we have determined the\nlower branch of the marginal stability curve, and there is another scaling between\n\u000b = O(R\u22121=7) and \u000b = O(1) which will give the upper branch.\n5.4.2. Upper branch of the marginal stability curve\nWe can see from (5.42) that there is another scaling possible. Suppose that, to\nleading order, \u0015 = 4\u000b2=15. Then the constant term in v as y ! \u22121 is O(\u000b4) and\na di\u000berent scaling is necessary for this term to appear in the boundary conditions\nof the inner problem. To have both the linear and constant terms appearing in the\nboundary conditions we require that in the inner scaling 1 + y = O(\u000b4). However,\nsince \u0015 = O(\u000b2) the inner scaling no longer has y and \u0015 of the same order, and the\ninner problem is slightly di\u000berent. In the inner region we balance \u0015vyy with (\u000bR)\n\u22121vyyyy\nso that the scaling is 1 +y \u0018 (\u0015\u000bR)\u22121=2, giving \u000b = O(R\u22121=11). Note that then the inner\nregion is 1 + y = O(R\u22124=11) = O((\u000bR)\u22122=5), while \u0015 = O(R\u22122=11) = O((\u000bR)\u22121=5). This\nmeans the maximum of the wkb solutions lies away from the boundary layer, and\nthe matching conditions on the inner region are more complicated.\n5.5. Centre modes in plane Poiseuille flow\nThe \fnal set of eigenmodes we need to consider are the centre modes of plane\nPoiseuille flow, which are localized near y = 0. The correct scaling is y = R\u22121=4\u000b\u22121=4\u0016y,\n\u0015 = 1 + \u000b\u22121=2R\u22121=2\u0016\u0015 (see, for example Corcos & Sellars 1959; Gill 1965), giving\ni\u0016\u0015v\u0016y\u0016y + i\u0016y\n2v\u0016y\u0016y \u2212 2iv + v\u0016y\u0016y\u0016y\u0016y = 0; (5.43)\n\u2212i\u0016\u0015\u0011 \u2212 i\u0016y2\u0011 \u2212 \u0011\u0016y\u0016y = 2i\f(\u000bR)\n1=4\u0016yv\n\u000b\n: (5.44)\nThe outer inviscid solutions satisfy\ny2(vyy \u2212 k2v)\u2212 2v = 0; (5.45)\nwith solution\nv = C1\n(\ncosh(ky)\ny\n\u2212 k sinh(ky)\n)\n+ C2\n(\nsinh(ky)\ny\n\u2212 k cosh(ky)\n)\n: (5.46)\nSince this must satisfy the Dirichlet condition at y = \u22121 to leading order we have\nv =\nk(1 + y)\ny\ncosh(ky)\u2212 1 + k\n2y\ny\nsinh(ky): (5.47)\nNow as y ! 0,\nv \u0018 k cosh k \u2212 sinh k\ny\n:\nHence, so long as k 6= 0, the boundary conditions on (5.43){(5.44) are\nv = v\u0016y\u0016y = \u0011\u0016y = 0 on \u0016y = 0;\nv ! k cosh k \u2212 sinh k\n\u0016y\n; \u0011 ! 0 as \u0016y ! \u22121;\nfor odd modes and\nv\u0016y = v\u0016y\u0016y\u0016y = \u0011 = 0 on \u0016y = 0;\nv ! k cosh k \u2212 sinh k\n\u0016y\n; \u0011 ! 0 as \u0016y ! \u22121;\nfor even modes.\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 73\nThis time, as k ! 0, the leading-order inviscid solutions are\nv =\nC1\ny\n+ C2y\n2;\nso that satisfying the Dirichlet condition at y = \u22121 is\nv =\n1 + y3\ny\n: (5.48)\nThen, as y ! 0,\nv \u0018 1\ny\n;\nso that there is nothing special about k ! 0 for the centre modes.\n5.5.1. Perturbation of the centre-mode eigenvalues for plane Poiseuille flow\nLet us now determine how large a streamwise streak has to be to perturb the\ncentre-mode eigenvalues at leading order.\nAs for the wall modes, to modify the centre modes we can either modify equation\n(5.43), or we can modify the boundary conditions, which come from the inviscid\nsolution on the outer region. We have already seen that the inviscid solutions will be\nmodi\fed when \u00110\f1 is of order one.\nIn the inner region the left-hand side of (3.23) is of order \u000bv, while the right-\nhand side is of order \u00110\f1\u000b(\u000bR)1=2v. Hence the equation for the centre modes will\nbe perturbed at leading order when the streamwise streak \u00110\f1 is O((\u000bR)\u22121=2) in the\ncentre region.\nNow, because in plane Poiseuille flow the odd and even modes decouple, if the\nstreamwise streak is an odd mode (v0\f1 odd, \u00110\f1 even) then \u00110\f1 takes values near\nthe origin of the same order as in the bulk, and \u00110\f1 of order (\u000bR)\u22121=2 in the bulk\nwill perturb the eigenvalues at leading order. However, if the streamwise streak is an\neven mode (v0\f1 even, \u00110\f1 odd) then \u00110\f1 is of order (\u000bR)\u22121=4 smaller near the origin\nthan in the bulk, and it requires an \u00110\f1 of order (\u000bR)\u22121=4 in the bulk to perturb the\neigenvalues at leading order.\nThus to minimize the perturbation required we should consider modes with \u000b as\nlarge as possible. The approximation of the eigenvalues in x 5.5 is valid so long as\n\u000b\u001c R1=3, at which point additional terms appear in the leading-order balance. Above\nthis value of \u000b the left-hand side of the equation grows more rapidly than the right,\nand the perturbation becomes weaker again. Thus the canonical scaling would seem\nto be \u000b = O(R1=3), for which modes an odd streamwise streak of O(R\u22122=3) or an even\nstreamwise streak of O(R\u22121=3) will perturb the eigenvalues at leading order. However,\nwe will see in the next section that even though these large-wavenumber eigenvalues\nare perturbed at leading order they remain stable, and that the order-one wavenumber\nmodes are the ones which become unstable. With \u000b of order one it requires an odd\nstreamwise streak of order R\u22121=2 to generate instability.\nNote that, since \u00110\f1 \u001c 1, none of the wall modes, including the Tollmien{\nSchlichting mode, are perturbed at leading order, so that the neutral stability curve\nof this mode is unchanged.\n5.6. Summary\nIn this section we have shown how to determine the position of the eigenvalues\nof the linearized Navier{Stokes equations asymptotically as \u000bR ! 1. We found\n74 S. J. Chapman\nthat to leading order the eigenvalues with O(1) imaginary component all lie on the\nanti-Stokes lines of the two wkb solutions. Thus to perturb these eigenvalues by an\norder-one amount, which will be necessary if they are to be perturbed to have positive\nimaginary component, it is necessary to change the phase of the wkb solutions, rather\nthan their amplitude, i.e. the perturbation must be su\u000eciently strong to have an\ne\u000bect on equation (5.4) or (5.12). We found that such a perturbation requires a\nstreamwise streak \u00110\f1 of order one, i.e. the base flow must be perturbed at leading\norder.\nFor the eigenvalues which have small imaginary component, the wall modes and\n(for plane Poiseuille flow) the centre modes, a di\u000berent approach is necessary, and\nthe eigenvalues are determined by a local \u2018inner region\u2019 in the vicinity of the wall\nor centre respectively. To perturb these eigenvalues into instability it is necessary\nfor the perturbation to be su\u000ecient to change this local equation (or its boundary\nconditions).\nThe wall modes have eigenvalues with imaginary component of order (\u000bR)\u22121=3,\nand also require a streamwise streak \u00110\f1 of order one to perturb them at leading\norder.\nThe centre modes have eigenvalues with imaginary component of order (\u000bR)\u22121=2\n(so long as \u000b 6 O(R1=3)). An odd streamwise streak of order (\u000bR)\u22121=2 will perturb\nthese eigenvalues, while if the streamwise streak is even it must be O((\u000bR)\u22121=4).\nThe most sensitive modes therefore correspond to \u000b = O(R1=3), for which an odd\nstreamwise streak of order R\u22122=3 or an even streamwise streak of order R\u22121=3 is\nenough to perturb the eigenvalues at leading order. However, even though these\nlarge-wavenumber eigenvalues are perturbed at leading order they remain stable, and\nit is in fact the order-one wavenumber modes which are the ones which become\nunstable. With \u000b of order one it requires an odd streamwise streak of order R\u22121=2, or\nan even streamwise streak of order R\u22121=4 to generate instability.\nWe have briefly included the rather special scalings which give the one unstable\nmode of plane Poiseuille flow. These will not be important for our bypass route to\ntransition (in fact, we will \fnd that the centre modes are the important ones in plane\nPoiseuille flow), but are included to show how the present work \fts in with traditional\nhydrodynamic stability theory.\nThe robustness of the eigenvalues of (5.1) and (5.2) with respect to perturbations\nis remarkable, given that, as discussed in the Introduction, the operators (3.17) and\n(3.18) are both highly non-normal as R ! 1 (in fact the eigenvalue problems for\nthese operators are exponentially ill-conditioned). Many values of \u0015 with real part\nbetween \u22121 and 1 fail to give eigenfunctions only by an exponentially small amount\nin R, since there is a corresponding solution which is exponentially small near each\nboundary by comparison to its maximum (Reddy & Henningson 1993).\nFinally we note that in the numerical simulations of Reddy et al. (1998) the sec-\nondary instability of a streamwise streak in Couette flow occurred through the per-\nturbation of a mode with order-one imaginary component, whereas that in Poiseuille\nflow occurred through the perturbation of a centre mode, in agreement with the\npresent asymptotic analysis.\n6. Secondary instability of centre modes\nLet us examine briefly the nature of the secondary instability of the centre modes.\nSince the Fourier modes in z are now all coupled it is easier to return to the\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 75\nNavier{Stokes equations and linearise about the new base flow, which is\nu = (1\u2212 y2; 0; 0) + \u000e(u0(y; z); 0; 0) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ; (6.1)\n! = (0; 0; 2y) + \u000e\n(\n0;\n@u0\n@z\n(y; z);\u2212@u0\n@y\n(y; z)\n)\n; (6.2)\nwhere \u000eu0(y; z) is the small transiently growing streamwise streak (with zero stream-\nwise wavenumber). Let us \frst examine the eigenvalue problem for \u000b large. Linearising\nthe Navier{Stokes equations (3.5){(3.11) about this flow gives\n\u0018t\u2212 (\u0011U)y+uzU 0 \u2212\u0010zU\u2212 1\nR\n(\u0018xx+\u0018yy+\u0018zz) = \u000e(\u2212(\u2212\u00110u\u2212\u0011u0)y+(\u00100u+\u0010u0)z); (6.3)\n\u0011t + \u0011xU + vzU\n0 \u2212 1\nR\n(\u0011xx + \u0011yy + \u0011zz) = \u000e((\u2212\u00110u\u2212 \u0011u0)x \u2212 (\u00110w \u2212 \u00100v)z); (6.4)\n\u0010t\u2212uxU 0+ \u0010xU\u2212 (vU 0)y\u2212 1\nR\n(\u0010xx + \u0010yy + \u0010zz) = \u000e(\u2212(\u00100u+ \u0010u0)x + (\u00110w\u2212 \u00100v)y); (6.5)\nux + vy + wz = 0; (6.6)\n\u0018 = wy \u2212 vz; (6.7)\n\u0011 = \u2212wx + uz; (6.8)\n\u0010 = vx \u2212 uy; (6.9)\nwith (u; v; w) = 0 on y = \u00061, where\n\u00100 = \u2212@u0\n@y\n; \u00110 =\n@u0\n@z\n: (6.10)\nSubtracting the x-derivative of (6.5) from the z-derivative of (6.3) we \fnd that the\nOrr{Sommerfeld equation is perturbed to\n\u2212r2vt + 1\nR\nr4v \u2212 2vx \u2212 (1\u2212 y2)r2vx = \u000e[\u00100uxx + u0\u0010xx \u2212 (\u00110wx)y + (\u00100vx)y\n+(\u00110u)yz + (\u0011u0)yz + (\u00100u)zz + (\u0010u0)zz]: (6.11)\nWriting u = u^(y; z)e\u2212i\u000b\u0015t+i\u000bx etc., with \u0016u0 even, using the centre-mode scalings\ny = (\u000bR)\u22121=4\u0016y; \u0015 = 1 + (\u000bR)\u22121=2\u0016\u0015; v^ = \u0016v; u^ = \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=4\u0016u;\nw^ = \u000b\u22122(\u000bR)1=4 \u0016w; \u0011^ = \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=4\u0016\u0011; \u0018^ = \u000b\u22122(\u000bR)1=2\u0016\u0018; \u0010^ = \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=2\u0016\u0010;\nwe \fnd that (6.4) and (6.11) become (with \u000b large)\n\u2212i\u0016\u0015\u0016\u0011\u2212 i\u0016y2\u0016\u0011\u22122\u0016y\u0016vz\u2212 \u0016\u0011\u0016y\u0016y + \u000f2\u000b2\u0016\u0011\u2212 \u000f2\u0016\u0011zz = \u000e\u000f\u22122(\u2212iu0(0; z)\u0016\u0011+\u00110(0; z)\u0016v\u0016y + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001); (6.12)\ni(\u0016\u0015+ \u0016y2)(\u0016v\u0016y\u0016y \u2212 \u000f2\u000b2\u0016v + \u000f2vzz) + \u0016v\u0016y\u0016y\u0016y\u0016y \u2212 2\u000f2\u000b2\u0016v\u0016y\u0016y + 2\u000f2v\u0016y\u0016yzz \u2212 2\u000f4\u000b2vzz\n+\u000f4vzzzz + \u000f\n4\u000b4\u0016v \u2212 2i\u0016v = i\u000e\u000f\u22122u0(0; z)(\u0016v\u0016y\u0016y \u2212 \u000f2\u000b2\u0016v + \u000f2vzz) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ; (6.13)\nwhere \u000f = (\u000bR)\u22121=4.

To minimize this we wish to make\n\u000b as large as possible. From the left-hand side of (6.12) and (6.13) it is clear that the\n76 S. J.

This is the distinguished limit considered by Davey & Nguyen (1971)\nfor the case of pipe Poiseuille flow. However, in contrast to the results of Davey &\nNguyen (1971), with \u000b = O(R1=3) even though the eigenvalues of (6.12) and (6.13) are\nperturbed at leading order, they all remain in the lower half-plane and are therefore\nstable.

For certain choices of u0(0; z) (and we can\nchoose u0(0; z) arbitrarily by combining di\u000berent Fourier modes in z in the analysis\nof x 4) there exists an inviscid instability for wavenumbers \u000b less than some critical\nwavenumber \u000bc (in particular u0(0; z) must have an inflection point) (see e.g. Drazin\n& Reid 1981).\nThe critical wavenumber \u000bc is related to the typical lengthscale for variation of\nu0(0; z). To obtain instability with \u000b of order R\n1=3 we would need u0(0; z) to vary on\nthe lengthscale R\u22121=3. This requires crosswise wavenumbers \f of order R1=3, for which\nthe transient growth is weaker. Large \f requires a wkb solution to (4.6){(4.7), which\nstill results in growth of \u0011 to be O(Rv), but now from (3.19) u is only order R\u22121=3\u0011.\nThis factor of R1=3 outweighs the factor R\u22121=6 we gain in \u000e from having \u000b of order\nR1=3, so that the optimal route to transition is to have \u000b and \f of order one.\nSince in the limit \u000e(\u000bR)1=2 ! 1 for some \u000b of order one there is an unstable\neigenvalue, by continuity there will continue to be an unstable eigenvalue so long as\n\u000e(\u000bR)1=2 is greater than some threshold (independent of R). Thus the threshold value\nof \u000e to generate instability is O(R\u22121=2).\nReddy et al. (1998) calculate the decay rate of the least stable centre mode numer-\nically and \fnd it to be proportional to R\u22120:55 in the range of Reynolds numbers they\nconsider (as opposed to the asymptotic value R\u22121=2). Instead of the mathematical ar-\ngument about eigenvalues above, they then use a physical argument by balancing this\ndissipation with the growth rate of the inflectional instability (which is proportional\nto \u000e), concluding that a streak of size O(R\u22120:55) will induce instability (which leads\nthem to a threshold amplitude for a streamwise vortex of O(R\u22121:55) as we will see in\nthe next section).\n7. Threshold amplitudes for transition\nWe are now in a position to combine the results of xx 4 and 5 to determine the\nthreshold amplitudes for transition for flows with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe two modes to transition described in the Introduction and demonstrated in\nthe toy model of x2 are\n(i) streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks\n! secondary instability of oblique modes;\n(ii) oblique modes! streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks\n! secondary instability of oblique modes:\nLet us consider plane Couette and plane Poiseuille flow separately.\n7.1. Plane Couette Flow\n7.1.1. Route (i): an initial perturbation in the form of streamwise vortices\nConsider an initial condition in the form of a streamwise vortex, that is \u0011 = 0,\nv = v0\f10 (y) exp(i\f1z) for some order-one \f1. We have seen in x 4 that if v0\f10 (y) varies\n78 S. J. Chapman\non an order-one lengthscale in y then it will decay over a timescale R, while at the\nsame time generating a streamwise streak \u00110\f1 of order Rv0\f10 . During this evolution\nthe right-hand side of (3.25) and (3.26) remains negligible, so that v0\f1 and \u00110\f1 are\nevolving linearly.\nThen, in x 5, we saw that a streamwise streak of order one is necessary to perturb\nthe eigenvalues of the oblique modes (3.27){(3.28) at leading order. Thus the threshold\namplitude for secondary instability in the oblique modes with an initial perturbation\nin the form of a streamwise vortex is O(R\u22121).\nNote that we have found that all the eigenvalues of the oblique modes are perturbed\nrelatively by the same order of magnitude when \u00110\f1 is of order one, so that there is\nno easy way to predict which eigenvalue is the \frst to cross the real axis. This will\ndepend on the nature of the initial condition and the exact size of the perturbation to\nthe eigenvalues (rather than just its order of magnitude). However, once the secondary\ninstability has taken place, the growth rate is order (\u000bR)\u22121=3 for the wall modes, but\norder one for the other modes. Hence we expect the secondary instability to occur\npredominantly away from the walls of the channel. Since the instability has an order-\none growth rate, while the streamwise modes are decaying over a timescale R, in\nthe limit of large R the secondary instability will generate fully developed order-one\noblique modes well before the streamwise modes have time to decay to zero, in which\ncase we enter the fully nonlinear regime of the equations and we expect to have\ntransition from the laminar state.\n7.1.2. Route (ii): an initial perturbation in the form of optimally growing oblique\nmodes\nNow consider an initial condition in the form of optimally growing oblique modes,\nthat is \u0011 = 0, v = v\u000b\f0 (y)e\ni\u000bxei\fz for some order-one \u000b and \f which we will choose\nshortly.\nWe have seen in x 4 which initial conditions v\u000b\f0 will generate the maximum linear\ngrowth in the solution. For such initial conditions v\u000b\f and \u0011\u000b\f oscillate on a lengthscale\n(\u000bR)\u22121=3 (so that the norm of the initial condition ku0k = O((\u000bR)1=3kv\u000b\f0 k)). For a time\nof order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3 they remain order v\u000b\f0 and order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3v\n\u000b\f\n0 respectively, when\nthey suddenly (over an order-one time) grow to be order (\u000bR)2=3v\u000b\f0 and \u000b\n\u22121(\u000bR)2=3v\u000b\f0\nrespectively, and cease to oscillate. After this, v\u000b\f immediately (i.e. over an O(\u000b\u22121)\ntime) returns to be order v\u000b\f0 , while \u0011\n\u000b\f remains of order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)2=3v\u000b\f0 , decaying over\nthe slow timescale (\u000bR)1=3 and oscillating again on the lengthscale (\u000bR)\u22121=3.\nThe \fnal piece of information we need to calculate the threshold amplitude for\ntransition by route (ii) is question (iii) of x 3, namely the the size of the streamwise\nvortex produced by the nonlinear terms in (3.25) and (3.26) during the evolution of\nv\u000b\f and \u0011\u000b\f .\nHowever, we also need to show that the nonlinear terms in (3.27) and (3.28) are\nof lower order than the linear terms during this \frst phase of the linear growth\nof the initial oblique mode (so that the evolution is indeed linear), which we do in\nAppendix E. Note that if this were not the case, then the alternative route to transition\ninvolving the \u2018boot-strapping\u2019 of oblique modes through nonlinear coupling, would\nhave a lower threshold amplitude than route (ii).\nNow for the oblique mode with the maximum transient growth, the phase of v\u000b\f\nand \u0011\u000b\f is pure imaginary, while the nonlinear terms in (3.25) and (3.26) involve\nproducts of the modes with streamwise wavenumber \u000b and \u2212\u000b. Hence we see from\n(4.32), (4.33) that if the initial conditions are such that the blow-up times of these two\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 79\nmodes are the same then the phases cancel in the product so that the nonlinear terms\nof (3.25) and (3.26) vary on an order-one lengthscale in y. On the other hand, if the\nblow-up times are di\u000berent, then the nonlinear terms of (3.25) and (3.26) oscillate in y\non the lengthscale (\u000bR)\u22121=3. The relevant scenario is the \frst one, since forcing (3.25)\nand (3.26) with a more and more rapidly varying inhomogeneous term leads to a\nwkb-type of solution which is of lower and lower amplitude (since the derivatives on\nthe left-hand side of the equation become larger and larger) and which decays more\nand more rapidly. Note that if the phases of v\u000b\f and \u0011\u000b\f were not pure imaginary\nthen the products in (3.25) and (3.26) would be forced to be rapidly varying, so that\nthe optimally growing oblique mode (which has a pure imaginary phase) also leads\nto the strongest possible forcing of streamwise modes. Thus the initial condition we\nshould give is in fact v = v\u000b\f0 (y)e\ni\u000bxei\fz + v\u2212\u000b\f0 (y)e\u2212i\u000bxei\fz for some non-zero \u000b and \f.\nWe have seen that the evolution of v\u000b\f and \u0011\u000b\f proceeds through three phases; as\nwe might expect, the dominant phase for the generation of streamwise vortices is the\nthird phase, where \u0011\u000b\f is large, slowly decaying, and rapidly oscillating in y. Since\n\u0011\u000b\f = O(\u000b\u22121(\u000bR)2=3v0), \u0011\u000b\fy = O(\u000b\u22121(\u000bR)v0), the terms \u0011\u000b\f\u0011\u2212\u000b\fy and \u0011\u2212\u000b\f\u0011\u000b\fy on the right-\nhand side of (3.23) are O(\u000b\u22122(\u000bR)5=3v20). However, since the phases of \u0011\u000b\f and \u0011\u2212\u000b\f are\nequal and opposite, the combination \u0011\u000b\f\u0011\u2212\u000b\fy + \u0011\u2212\u000b\f\u0011\u000b\fy is only O(\u000b\u22122(\u000bR)4=3v20). Since\nit holds this value for a time of order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)1=3, if \u000b 6 O(1) the nonlinear terms in\n(3.23) will produce a non-oscillatory v0\f of order \u000b\u22121(\u000bR)5=3v20 (which is Rku0k2) during\nthis phase, while if \u000b\u001d 1 the nonlinear terms in (3.23) will produce a non-oscillatory\nv0\f of order \u000b\u22125(\u000bR)5=3v20 (or \u000b\u22124Rku0k2) . Hence to maximize the streamwise vortex\nproduced we should choose \u000b to be less than or equal to order one.\nWe are now in a position to determine the threshold amplitude for an initial\ndisturbance in the form of oblique modes. We have already seen that a streamwise\nvortex v0\f of order R\u22121 is enough to induce transition, and we have now seen\nthat an initial oblique-mode perturbation v0 of order R\n\u22124=3 is enough to produce\nthis. However, remember that this initial perturbation is oscillating rapidly on the\nlengthscale R\u22121=3, so that both its L2 and L1 norm are in fact of order R\u22121.\nFor completeness we should check that the oblique modes are not producing large\nstreamwise streaks at the same time as they are producing the streamwise vortices.\nWe \fnd that the nonlinear terms in (3.26) are of order R4=3v20 , which is smaller than\nthe forcing term v on the left-hand side, so that they are indeed negligible.\nIn summary, the threshold amplitude for transition with an initial perturbation\nboth in the form of a streamwise vortex and in the form of an oblique mode is\nO(R\u22121).\nIn \fgure 19 we show a schematic diagram of the route to transition showing the\nnorm of the solution at each stage.\n7.2. Plane Poiseuille flow\nLet us now determine the threshold amplitude for initial perturbations of plane\nPoiseuille flow. As explained in the introduction, we are concerned with the small\ndomain of attraction of the stable modes of the system, and will ignore the unstable\nmodes of non-periodic flows.\n7.2.1. Route (i): an initial perturbation in the form of streamwise vortices\nConsider an initial condition in the form of a streamwise vortex, that is \u0011 = 0,\nv = v0\f10 (y) exp(i\f1z) for some non-zero \f1. As for plane Couette flow v\n0\f1\n0 (y) will\ndecay over a timescale R, while at the same time generating a streamwise streak \u00110\f1\nof order Rv0\f10 .\n80 S. J.

A schematic diagram showing the route to transition for plane Couette flow with the\nnorm of the solution at each point.\nIn x 5 we saw that the most sensitive eigenvalues are the centre modes. We found\nthat a streamwise streak \u00110\f1 of order one was necessary to perturb the other modes\nat leading order, whereas an even \u00110\f1 of order R\u22121=2, or an odd \u00110\f1 of order R\u22121=4\nis enough to perturb the centre modes at leading order. Hence for an odd initial\nperturbation v0\f10 the threshold amplitude for streamwise vortices is R\n\u22123=2, while for\nan even initial perturbation v0\f10 the threshold amplitude is R\n\u22125=4.\nSince it is the centre modes which produce the secondary instability in plane\nPoiseuille flow the instability will be concentrated in the centre of the channel. Note\nalso that in contrast to the Tollmien{Schlichting wave, which has \u000b asymptotically\nsmall with R, the centre modes which become unstable are those with streamwise\nwavenumber \u000b of order one.\nSince the imaginary component of the perturbed eigenvalues is order R\u22121=2, the\ngrowth rate of the instability will be order R\u22121=2. For large values of R this is much\nlarger than the decay rate of the streamwise modes (which is order R\u22121), so that\nonce the secondary instability takes place the solution will proceed to enter the fully\nnonlinear regime of the equations and we expect to have transition from the laminar\nstate. However, for Reynolds numbers in the range 1500 to 5000, the di\u000berence\nbetween these two timescales is not so great as it is in the case of plane Couette\nflow. Hence it may be possible to initiate a secondary instability which does not have\ntime to grow enough to produce transition before the streamwise streak has decayed\nand stabilized the oblique modes. This may explain why the numerically determined\nthreshold scalings for secondary instability and for full transition are the same for\nplane Couette flow, but di\u000ber for plane Poiseuille flow in the region 1500 < R < 5000\n(Reddy et al. 1998).\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 81\nLinear\ngrowth \u00b7 R\nStreamwise\nvortices\nO(R\u20133\/2)\nStreamwise\nstreaks\nO(R\u20131\/2)\nOblique\nmodes\nOblique\nmodes\nUnstable linear system\nLinear\ngrowthOblique\nmodes\nO(R\u20135\/4)\nOblique\nmodes\nO(R\u201311\/12)\n\u00b7 R1\/3\nNonlinear\nforcing Square \u00b7 R\n1\/3\nFigure 20. A schematic diagram showing the route to transition for plane Poiseuille flow with the\nnorm of the solution at each point.\n7.2.2. Route (ii): an initial perturbation in the form of optimally growing oblique\nmodes\nNow consider an initial condition in the form of optimally growing oblique modes,\nthat is \u0011 = 0, v = v\u000b\f0 (y)e\ni\u000bxei\fz + v\u2212\u000b\f0 (y)e\u2212i\u000bxei\fz for some non-zero \u000b and \f, as for\nplane Couette flow.\nThe calculation of the size of oblique and streamwise modes generated by the\nnonlinear terms proceeds exactly as in the case of plane Couette flow. Thus an initial\ncondition of order v0 produces a streamwise vortex of order R\n5=3v20 . Note also that the\nstreamwise vortex produced is odd, whether the initial oblique perturbation is odd or\neven. Thus an oblique perturbation of order R\u221219=12 will lead to transition. However,\nsince v0 oscillates rapidly in y on the scale R\n\u22121=3, the norm of this perturbation (both\nL2 and L1), which is the threshold amplitude, is of order R\u22125=4.\nIn summary, the threshold amplitude for an initial perturbation in the form of\na streamwise vortex is O(R\u22125=4) for even perturbations in y and O(R\u22123=2) for odd\nperturbations in y, while the threshold amplitude for an initial perturbation in the\nform of oblique modes is O(R\u22125=4). In each case the \fnal secondary instability occurs\nin the centre modes.\nIn \fgure 20 we show a schematic diagram of the route to transition showing the\nnorm of the solution at each stage.\nWe have found that in the limit R ! 1 a perturbation of O(R\u22123=2) is enough\nto produce a secondary instability in the centre modes, while leaving the neutral\ncurve of the Tollmien{Schlichting mode unchanged. Thus our scenario for subcritical\ntransition in plane Poiseuille flow is that for large but subcritical Reynolds numbers\n82 S. J. Chapman\na small but \fnite perturbation will destabilize the centre modes while leaving the wall\nmodes stable.\n7.3. Threshold amplitudes for transition in non-periodic flows\nThe L1 norm of the threshold amplitude of u scales-the same way for periodic and\nnon-periodic flows; the separation between streamwise and oblique modes becomes\nasymptotic rather than sharp, but the analysis proceeds in exactly the same way.\nHowever, when the solution is not periodic we must be more careful in calculating\nits energy norm.\nIt is tempting just to let the period tend to in\fnity in (3.30), to give the rms energy\nnorm\nlim\nlx;lz!1\n(\n1\nlxlz\n\u222b lx\n0\n\u222b lz\n0\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n(u2 + v2 + w2) dy dz dx\n)1=2\n: (7.1)\nHowever, any perturbation localized over a \fnite region now has zero norm, and\nsince such perturbations can clearly lead to transition the threshold amplitude is\nmeaningless. On in\fnite domains we must instead consider the norm corresponding\nto the total energy of the perturbation(\n1\n2\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n\u222b 1\n\u22121\n(u2 + v2 + w2) dy dz dx\n)1=2\n: (7.2)\nNow, though, a streamwise perturbation with \u000b = 0 does not decay at in\fnity in x,\nand therefore has in\fnite norm. However, streamwise perturbations with \u000b = O(R\u22121)\nexhibit the same growth characteristics, and these extend a distance O(R) in the\nstreamwise direction, so that their norm is greater than the L1 norm by a factor of\norder R1=2. Likewise, for a pair of oblique modes to generate a streamwise vortex\nthey must extend a distance O(R) in the streamwise direction, so that here again the\nenergy norm is greater than the L1 norm by a factor of order R1=2.\nBecause of these extra factors, the transition involving only oblique modes described\nin Appendix E may come into play, and a more careful analysis of it is required. In\nfact, when considering in\fnite domains it is probably better to work in the primary\nspace of x and z rather than the Fourier space of \u000b and \f.\n8. Comparison with numerical experiments\nNumerical experiments by Lundbladh et al. (1994) seem to suggest that the thresh-\nold amplitude for plane Couette flow should scale like R\u22121 for streamwise vortices\nand like R\u22125=4 for oblique modes, while for plane Poiseuille flow it should scale\nlike R\u22127=4 for both streamwise vortices and oblique modes. Kreiss et al. (1994) also\nexamine numerical evolution of a pair of streamwise vortices in Couette flow and\n\fnd a threshold amplitude which scales like R\u22121. Further experiments by Reddy et al.\n(1998) suggest that the amplitude of an initial streamwise vortex necessary to induce a\nsecondary instability in the oblique modes scales like R\u22121 and R\u22121:6 for plane Couette\nflow and plane Poiseuille flow respectively. Our asymptotic results of R\u22121 and R\u22123=2\nrespectively agree reasonably well with these, and we already have an explanation in\nx 7.2.1 for the fact that, for not too large Reynolds numbers, there might be a di\u000ber-\nence between the amplitude necessary for transition and that necessary for secondary\ninstability.\nHowever, there is disagreement for the oblique-mode threshold in both plane\nCouette and plane Poiseuille flow, which we now try to explain.\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 83\n103\n102\n101\n100\n102 103 104 105 106\nReynolds number\nM\nax\nim\num\n g\nro\nw\nth\nFigure 21.

Plane Couette flow\nFigure 21 shows the numerically determined maximum growth of the norm of the\nsolution of the linearized Navier{Stokes equations as a function of the Reynolds\nnumber for the oblique mode \u000b = 1, \f = 1 in plane Couette flow. Figure 22 shows an\napproximation to the gradient of this curve, calculated using a simple central di\u000berence\nbetween successive points. We see that the curve takes a long time to approach its\nasymptote of 1\/3. The transient growth appears to scale like a much higher power of\nthe Reynolds number than this for Reynolds numbers in the range 500 6 R 6 2000,\nwhich is the range for the numerical experiments in Lundbladh et al. (1994).\nLet us try and determine the e\u000bect of this on the threshold amplitude. Suppose that\nthe transient growth in the oblique modes is G and that it decays over a timescale T .\nThen if the initial norm of the perturbation is N, the nonlinear terms in (3.23) will pro-\nduce a v of size TG2N2. Hence, the condition for instability is TG2N2 \u0018 R\u22121, so that\nN \u0018 R\n\u22121=2\nGT 1=2\n: (8.1)\nHence if the exponent of the growth in the oblique modes appears larger than it really\nis, the exponent of the threshold amplitude will appear smaller than the true asymp-\ntotic value. In \fgure 23 we show the result of using the numerically determined value\nof G to estimate the scaling of N. Thus we have a possible explanation for why the\nthreshold amplitude found in Lundbladh et al. (1994) for the range 500 6 R 6 2000\nis much lower than \u22121.\n8.2.

Conclusions\nWe have examined the threshold amplitude for transition from the laminar state\nas the Reynolds number R !1 through an analysis of the Navier{Stokes equations.\nWe \fnd that for plane Couette flow the threshold scales like R\u22121 for the two routes\nto transition\n(i) streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks\n! secondary instability of oblique modes;\n(ii) oblique modes! streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks\n! secondary instability of oblique modes;\nSubcritical transition in channel flows 87\nwhile for plane Poiseuille flow the threshold scales like R\u22125=4 and R\u22123=2 for even and\nodd perturbations respectively via route (i), and like R\u22125=4 via route (ii) (see table 2).\nWe have also examined the boot-strapping route to transition\n(iii) streamwise vortices! streamwise streaks! streamwise vortices\nand have found that the threshold amplitude is of O(R\u22121) for both plane Couette and\nplane Poiseuille flow.\nThe secondary instability in the oblique modes in plane Couette flow occurs in\nall modes and will therefore be distributed throughout the channel, although the\ngrowth rate of the wall modes is much smaller than that of the others. The growth\nrate of the non-wall modes is of O(1), while the streamwise streak generating the\ninstability decays on a timescale of O(R), so that the secondary instability has plenty\nof time to generate order-one oblique modes, entering the fully nonlinear regime in\nthe equations, before the streak decays.\nFor plane Poiseuille flow the secondary instability is in the centre modes, which\nare localized near the centre of the channel. The instability is essentially an inviscid\ninstability due to an inflectional pro\fle in the crosswise coordinate z; the centre modes\nare the most sensitive since they are localized in a region of low shear. The growth rate\nof the instability is of O(R\u22121=2); in this case, even though there is a large di\u000berence in\nthe timescales as R ! 1, for \fnite R they may not be so di\u000berent and it is possible\nthat the secondary instability may not have time to generate order-one oblique modes\nleading to full transition before the streamwise streak has decayed. This may explain\nthe di\u000berence in the threshold amplitudes for secondary instability and transition\nobserved numerically in Reddy et al. (1998). For the route to transition (i) we \fnd\nthat the threshold amplitude scales di\u000berently for odd and even perturbations, which\nagrees with the numerical \fndings of Lundbladh et al. (1994).\nOur asymptotic results for threshold amplitudes for the route to transition (i) agree\nwith the numerical results of Lundbladh et al. (1994). However, the results for the\nroute to transition (ii) are not in such good agreement. This is because the transient\ngrowth in the oblique modes converges only slowly to its asymptotic value, which\nleads to an apparently lower threshold exponent at moderate Reynolds numbers.\nFor plane Couette flow and plane Poiseuille flow on a \fxed periodic domain our\nresults determine the scaling of the basin of attraction of the laminar state as R !1.\nHowever, plane Poiseuille flow on an in\fnite domain is linearly unstable for large\nReynolds numbers, so that our analysis needs more careful interpretation. We have\ndetermined the scaling of the domain of attraction of the stable modes of the system.\nWhile such an analysis is irrelevant for very large R (since the unstable modes will\ndominate), we expect that subcritical transition for R < 5772 is caused by the small\ndomain of attraction of the laminar state, and that the origin of this and route to\ntransition is qualitatively similar to that of the stable modes in the limit as R !1.\nWe have examined explicitly the cases of plane Couette and plane Poiseuille flow,\nbut the analysis is trivially extended to the case of a combined plane Poiseuille and\nplane Couette flow. The transient growth calculation is valid for arbitrary U(y).\nThe calculations of the perturbations of the eigenvalues follow as before. The only\ndi\u000berence is that the centre modes exist if and only if there is a point of zero shear\nin the pro\fle U(y). If this is the case then the flow will basically behave like plane\nPoiseuille flow, while if not it will behave like plane Couette flow. Of course there is a\nspecial case when the zero shear point lies on the wall, but this is also easily treated.\nWhile the asymptotic results compare resonably favourably with direct numerical\nsimulations of the Navier{Stokes equations on periodic domains, it is very di\u000ecult to\n88 S. J. Chapman\n\fnd suitable experimental data with which to compare. This is because the transient\ngrowth of streamwise vortices to streamwise streaks takes a long time (it occurs\non the viscous timescale of order R): the streamwise vortex transfers momentum\nfrom the basic flow via the lift-up mechanism until it decays through the action of\nviscosity. Hence in an experimental situation the maximum transient growth will not\nbe achieved until the perturbation has travelled a distance O(R) (i.e. order Reynolds\nnumber channel half-widths) downstream. Experimental con\fgurations often have\nvery long pipes or channels, but this is to ensure that the boundary layers generated\nat the inlet have di\u000bused to establish Poiseuille flow (which also takes a distance O(R)).\nA perturbation is induced and typically transition is looked for a few pipe diameters\nor channel widths downstream. An optimal perturbation of the type described here\nwould be out of the end of the pipe or channel before it had had a chance to induce\ntransition.\nThere are two conclusions we can draw from this: (i) if the threshold amplitude is\nto be measured experimentally it is necessary to have a pipe which is O(R) radii long\nboth upstream and downstream of the induced perturbation, and (ii) the threshold\namplitude described in this paper, although optimal for in\fnite channels, may be\nincreased for \fnite channels. With a \fnite channel it is necessary to place restrictions\non the time taken to achieve transition. The transient growth of streamwise modes\nwill be reduced in proportion to the time allowed, which will correspondingly raise\nthe threshold amplitude.\nThe author would like to thank Professor L. N.

Poor numerical agreement with the asymptotics for even\nmodes\nThe reason for the poor agreement between the asymptotic and numerical results\nin \fgure 18 is that when A^ and B^ are chosen to satisfy the leading-order behaviour\nin (5.28), namely\nA^v1 + (B^ \u2212 b(\u000bR)3=4)v2 \u0018 0;\nthen\nA^v01 + (B^ \u2212 b(\u000bR)3=4)v02\nis close to zero, so that the eigenvalues are pushed closer to the anti-Stokes line.

Now, for arg(s) < \u22122\u0019=3 the steepest descent path from the dominant\nwkb approximation to the Airy function tends to s = +1 e\u22124i\u0019=3 rather than s = +1.\nHowever, because of the Stokes phenomenon in the Airy function we must be careful\nnot to deform the contour to this path, on which the other wkb approximation is\npresent, which grows at in\fnity. We deform \frst to a contour from the endpoint\nto \u22121 plus an integration along the real axis, as shown in \fgure 27(b). Then we\nsplit the integration along the contour from the endpoint to \u22121 in to the two wkb\napproximations, and deform one contour to go to s = +1 e\u22124i\u0019=3 and one to go to\ns = +1 e\u22122i\u0019=3, as shown in \fgure 27(c). Since neither path goes through the turning\npoint the wkb approximations are valid. However, for the integration along the real\naxis we cannot replace the Airy function by its wkb approximation.\nThus we \fnd that across the Stokes line we have two endpoint contributions, corre-\nsponding to the two wkb solutions, and the integral along the real axis, corresponding\nto the inviscid solution.

Nonlinear oblique mode interactions\nLet us \frst note that the phases of the nonlinear terms in (3.23), (3.24) automatically\nsatisfy the eikonal equation, so that the nonlinear terms are e\u000bectively forcing the\namplitude equations (4.22), (4.23). We begin by determining the size of the optimally\ngrowing oblique-mode perturbation required to bring the nonlinear terms in (3.23),\n(3.24) into play if the initial conditions are such that the blow-up times for all\nwavenumbers are the same. Then the nonlinear terms also feed back onto modes with\nthis blow-up time. During the \frst phase of the evolution the left-hand side of (3.23)\nis order R1=3v0 while the right-hand side is order Rv\n2\n0 , giving v0 = O(R\n\u22122=3). Likewise\nthe left-hand side of (3.24) is order v0, while the right-hand side is order R\n2=3v20 .\nDuring the second phase the left-hand sides of (3.23) and (3.24) are order R2=3v0,\nwhile the right-hand sides are order R4=3v20 .\nDuring the third phase the left-hand side of (3.24) is order R1=3v0 while the right-\nhand side is order R4=3v20 . Similarly the left-hand side of (3.23) is order R\n1=3v0 while\nthe right-hand side is order R5=3v20 . As expected, the third phase is the dominant\none. However, even though (3.23) would seem to imply a nonlinear e\u000bect when\nv0 = O(R\n\u22124=3), in fact the forcing term in (3.23) is a function of \u0011 only, and there is\nno forcing term in the \u0011-equation with this scaling, so that v simply grows transiently\nas \u0011 decays. To obtain a true feedback requires the scaling v0 = O(R\n\u22121) so that the\nnonlinear terms in (3.24) come into play.\nThere is no boot-strapping in the method of transition described above { the initial\ntransient growth simply gives the solution a kick start. The e\u000bect of the transient\ngrowth will be greater if the nonlinear terms can feed the large amplitude of two\nmodes past their blow-up times back into another mode before its blow-up time.\nFrom (4.32), (4.33) we see that the blow-up time of the mode fed by the product of\nmodes with streamwise wavenumbers n1 and n2 and blow-up times ~t1 and ~t2 is the\nweighted average\nn1~t1 + n2~t2\nn1 + n2\n:\nIf n1 and n2 have opposite sign then this time can be greater than both ~t1 and ~t2. Then\nthe amplitude of the new mode generated by the nonlinear terms is order R4=3v20 . Thus\nthe cut-o\u000b for the new mode having larger amplitude than the original two modes is\nv0 = O(R\n\u22124=3). In order to generate a boot-strapping e\u000bect we need to feed this mode\nback into another with later blow-up time and so on. If this is possible ad in\fnitum\n(which is not immediately clear) then the threshold is v0 = O(R\n\u22124=3). Since v0 varies\non the lengthscale R\u22121=3 this implies that the threshold norm is O(R\u22121).\nNote that for the route to transition (ii) the size of the oblique-mode perturbation\n96 S. J. Chapman\nwas v0 = O(R\n\u22124=3), so that the nonlinear terms in (3.23) and (3.24) are indeed negligible\nin that case.\nREFERENCES\nBaggett, J. & Trefethen, L. 1997 Low-dimensional models of subcritical transition to turbulence.\nPhys.
