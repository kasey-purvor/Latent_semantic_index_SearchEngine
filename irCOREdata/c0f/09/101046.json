INTRODUCTION\nThe rapid neutron capture process, or r process, is one of\nthe dominant mechanisms for producing heavy nuclei with\nmasses above A = 60. The r process is characterized by a\nseries of rapid neutron-capture reactions, photodisintegration\nprocesses, and \u03b2 decays that convert initial seed nuclei into\nheavier neutron-rich elements [1,2]. A reliable prediction of\nr-process nucleosynthesis requires not only knowledge of\nthese reaction rates but also accurate modeling of the pro-\nduction of seed abundances and the neutron flux. The present\nwork is concerned with clarifying the production mechanism\nfor nuclear seed material.\nThe actual astrophysical site of the r process is still\nunder debate [3\u20135], but among the currently favored sites\nis the high-entropy neutrino-heated environment above the\nnascent protoneutron star [6\u201310] in a core-collapse supernova\nor the shock ejection of neutronized low-entropy material\nvia supernovae [11] or merging neutron stars [4]. In the\nhigh-entropy neutrino-energized bubble, the seed abundance\nis assembled in statistical equilibrium from free protons,\nneutrons, and \u03b1 particles via the \u03b1 process [6,12\u201314] as\nmaterial is ablated by neutrino heating within seconds after\nthe core bounce. The \u03b1 process is limited, however, by the rate\nof reactions to bridge the unstable mass gaps at A = 5 and 8,\ni.e., the (3\u03b1) and (\u03b1+\u03b1+n) three-particle fusion processes that\nproduce 12C and 9Be, respectively.\nOf particular importance for the present paper, however,\nis an alternative reaction path through the A = 5, 8 gap via\na series of dineutron capture processes on 4He and 6He. It\nhas been suggested [4\u201312,15\u201318] that these reactions might\ncontribute in neutron-rich r-process environments. Recent\nr-process simulations, however, have suggested [12] that\nthe rates for this reaction link are insufficient to produce\na substantial change in the reaction flow toward heavier\nelements in high-entropy environments. The possibility re-\nmains, however, for this process to contribute in low-entropy,\nneutron-rich environments. In the present work we therefore\nextend the earlier studies by considering neutron-rich r-process\nenvironments with much lower entropy. We examine the\nquestion as to whether the reaction 6He(\u03b1, n)9Be, combined\nwith a significantly enhanced 4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He rate could indeed\nbridge these gaps and significantly affect the subsequent\nr-process nucleosynthesis.\nOne purpose of this article, therefore, is to determine\nthe reaction rates for these two reactions. Indeed, we show\nthat the reaction rate for the 4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He increases when\nnew experimental data about the level structure of the\n6He halo nucleus is taken into account. Moreover, there is\na second mechanism that has been neglected in previous\nestimates that concentrated entirely on a sequential neutron\ncapture mechanism [19,20]. Specifically, in this article we\ninvestigate the possibility of the dineutron capture process\n4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He. This requires an analysis of both the possibility\nof formation and the subsequent capture of a dineutron at\nthe high-density conditions appropriate to the r process.\nThis capture is dominated by a nonresonant direct capture\nmechanism that has been calculated in the framework of a\npotential model [21].\nIn the following sections we describe the derivation of\nthe 4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He reaction rate. We also attempt a first\n0556-2813\/2006\/74(1)\/015802(8) 015802-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nAMY BARTLETT et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 015802 (2006)\nestimate of the rate of the subsequent 6He(\u03b1, n)9Be process\nindependently through a one-level resonance model, taking\ninto account possible interference effects between the broad\nresonance states in the compound nucleus 10Be [23]. In the\nlast section we compare the reaction rate for two-neutron\ncapture with rates of the competing triple-\u03b1 and \u03b1-\u03b1-n reaction\nas links to the higher mass range. We then illustrate the\ndevelopment of the \u03b1-process and r-process nucleosynthesis\nin the framework of various schematic parametrized r-process\nsimulations [22].\nII. TWO-NEUTRON CAPTURE REACTIONS ON 4He\nThree particle reactions in high-density, high-temperature\nstellar environments typically occur through a two step\nmechanism. The first step is the formation of an intermediate\nparticle-unbound component, which is in equilibrium between\nformation through scattering and decay. The second step is\nthe subsequent capture of a second particle on the equilibrium\nabundance. This approach has been the basis of formulating the\ntriple-\u03b1 reaction rate through the \u03b1 unbound 8Be nucleus [24]\nas well as for the \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n reaction through the equilibrium\nabundance of 8Be [19] with subsequent neutron capture or,\nadditionally, through 5He [25] with subsequent \u03b1 capture.\nA third three-particle fusion process, the 4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He\nreaction, may take place in environments with a large neutron\nabundance.\nIn previous work the 4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He reaction rate was\ncalculated in a sequential neutron-capture formalism, taking\ninto account only the abundance distribution of neutron-\nunbound 5He as an intermediate state [19,20]. It was shown\nthat the reaction rate for the sequential two-neutron capture\nprocess is determined by the contribution of the broad 2+\nd-wave resonance state at 1.78 MeV in 6He and the p-\nwave direct neutron capture to the ground state in 6He.\nThe reaction rate for this process is determined by the\nneutron separation energy of 5He. Because 5He is unbound by\n0.8 MeV the equilibrium abundance for 5He is prohibitively\nsmall. The resonant neutron-capture rate on 5He is determined\nby the E2 \u03b3 -decay width of the 1.78-MeV state in 6He. In\nRef. [19] a value of B(E2, 2+ \u2192 0+) = 0.57 e2 fm4 was used.\nThis implies a \u03b3 width of 8.8 \u00b5eV for decay from the excited\nstate at 1.78 MeV to the ground state in 6He. More recently,\nhowever, a study of the three-body breakup of 6He gave a value\nof B(E2, 0+ \u2192 2+) = (3.2 \u00b1 0.6) e2 fm4 [26]. This implies\na B(E2, 2+ \u2192 0+) value of 0.64 e2 fm4 and a \u03b3 width of\n9.88 \u00b5eV. Although this result suggests a small increase in\nthe resonant component, the value for the dominating direct\ncapture to the ground state still depends on the single-particle\nstructure of the 6He ground state.\nBecause the ground-state structure of 6He is characterized\nby a two-neutron skin, we have calculated the possibility of\nits formation through dineutron (2n) capture on 4He. The\ndineutron capture rate has been estimated using a similar\nformalism as used for deriving the two neutron sequential\ncapture rate [19]. Both successive neutron capture and dineu-\ntron capture are two-step reactions. Consequently, the reaction\nrate \u30081nn\u3009 for both these three-particle reactions is described\nby a double integral,\nN2A\u30081nn\u3009 = N2A\n\u222b\nE1\nd\u3008(n, n)\u3009(E1)\ndE1\n2h\u00af\n\u0004(E1)\n\u00d7\n[\u222b\nE2\nd\u3008n, \u03b3 \u3009(E1, E2)\ndE2\ndE2\n]\ndE1, (1)\nwhere the integrands are given by\nd\u3008\u03c3v\u3009\ndE\n=\n\u221a\n8\n\u03c0\u00b5\n1\n(kT ) 32\n\u03c3 (E) exp\n(\n\u2212 E\nkT\n)\n. (2)\nThe term \u3008n, n\u3009 refers to the rate for the first reaction step\nof 4He + n or n + n scattering at a collision energy of E1.\nThe term \u3008n, \u03b3 \u3009 refers to the second step, i.e., the capture rate\nof the second neutron on 5He or the rate for the dineutron\ncapture on 4He with E2 as the collision energy. The \u00042(E1)\nis the energy-dependent width of the intermediate nucleus,\nwhich in the first case is the ground state of 5He, and in the\ncase of dineutron capture, is the width of the virtual dineutron\nstate.\nThe cross section for elastic neutron scattering \u03c3n,n(E)\nhas been directly derived from the neutron-neutron scattering\nlength ann = \u221218.6 \u00b1 0.4 fm, as recently confirmed through\nthe (2H,2He) charge-exchange experiment [27]. Figure 1\nshows the resultant n-n-scattering cross-section. Because the\nenergy of the 1S0 nn virtual state is very close to zero energy\nthe physical nn cross section increases as E1 \u2192 0. Here,\nwe have approximated the dineutron state as a 0+ resonance\nwith a width of \u00042(E1) = 0.095 MeV derived from fitting the\nscattering cross-section curve.\nThe second reaction (dineutron capture on 4He) has a\nQ value of 0.973 MeV. The cross section is determined by\nresonant capture and direct capture contributions. The resonant\nterm is dominated by a d-wave dineutron capture into the\n1.797 MeV J\u03c0 =2+ state with a resonance energy of Er =\n0.824 MeV. This state decays by E2 \u03b3 emission to the ground\nstate. In direct capture the dineutron is captured into the ground\nstate of 6He.

With this\nconfiguration the direct capture is dominated by an E1 p \u2192\ns transition.

This figure clearly demonstrates that, in all three\ncases, the reaction rates are of similar strength at temperatures\nT \u0001 108 K.\nIII. 6He(\u03b1, n)9Be REACTION RATE\nThe reaction rate for 6He(\u03b1, n)9Be is determined by several\nbroad overlapping resonances. The \u03b1 unbound levels in\nthe compound nucleus 10Be above the \u03b1 threshold (S\u03b1 =\n7.412 MeV) are well known [28,29]. The low-energy-reaction\ncross section is dominated by a 2+ resonance state at\nEx = 7.542 MeV and by the low-energy tails of several\nhigher-energy resonance states above 9.3 MeV. The level\nparameters are reasonably well known [29] or have been\ndetermined from the available experimental data on 10Be. The\n2+ state at 7.542 MeV has a width of 6.3 \u00b1 0.8 keV and\nhas recently been identified [30] as a highly deformed \u03b1-\u03b1-2n\nchain configuration with a unusually large \u03b1 partial width of\n\u0004\u03b1 = 22 \u00b1 8 eV. The ratio of \u0004\u03b1\/\u0004 = 0.0035 \u00b1 0.0012 yields\na neutron partial width of\u0004n = 6280 eV. The 2+ excited state at\n9.560 MeV has a total width of \u0004 = 141 \u00b1 10 keV. The partial\nwidths are derived from the ratio \u0004\u03b1\/\u0004 = 0.16 \u00b1 0.04. The\nexcited state at 10.150 MeV has been identified as a 3\u2212 member\nof the K\u03c0 = 1\u2212 band in 10Be [30,31]. The total width has been\ndetermined to be \u0004tot = 296 \u00b1 16 keV. Earlier measurements\nindicated a small neutron partial width [32]; we have therefore\nadopted \u0004n \u2248 10 keV. The level at 10.57 MeV has been\nsuggested [30] as the 4+ member of the K\u03c02 = 0+ rotational\nband. Because no information is available about the width of\nthe state (\u0004tot \u0002 150 keV, we calculated the partial widths using\na WKB approximation by adopting the single-particle and the\n\u03b1-cluster configuration of the state from the 2+ member of\nthe band at 7.5 MeV (see discussion above) [30].) The level\nat Ex = 11.76 MeV excitation energy has a total width of\n\u0004tot = 121 \u00b1 10 keV. No spin assignment has been made. We\nadopted a spin of J\u03c0 = 0+ on the basis of a theoretical analysis\nof molecular orbital structure in 10Be [33] that predicted\na J\u03c0 = 0+ member of the K\u03c0 = 0+ ground-state band at\n11.6 MeV excitation energy. The partial widths were de-\ntermined from a ratio of \u0004\u03b1\/\u0004n = 0.1 adopted from the\nother band member states. All resonance level parameters are\nsummarized in Table I.\nOn the basis of these parameters the total cross section\nhas been estimated in terms of a single-level Breit-Wigner\nformalism, including possible interference effects between\nthe 2+ resonance states. Figure 4 shows the calculated cross\nsection for the 6He(\u03b1, n)9Be reaction up to 5 MeV of \u03b1 energy.\nThe reaction rate was calculated by averaging over the usual\nMaxwellian distribution for temperature T,\n\u3008\u03c3v\u3009 =\n\u221a\n8\n\u03c0\u00b5\n1\n(kT ) 32\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03c3 (E) E exp\n(\n\u2212 E\nkT\n)\ndE, (3)\nwhere \u00b5 is the reduced mass.\n015802-3\nAMY BARTLETT et al.

IMPACT ON NEUTRON FLUX AND r-PROCESS\nNUCLEOSYNTHESIS\nDespite decades of study, the astrophysical site for the main\nr-process component is still unknown. There are three domi-\nnant candidates: neutrino-driven winds in Type II supernovae;\nthe prompt explosion of low-mass supernovae; and neutron\nstar mergers. The conditions for the r-process nucleosynthesis,\nsuch as the temperature and density profile, are significantly\ndifferent in each of these candidate environments. Although\nthere have been many theoretical nucleosynthesis studies\naimed at testing the viability of those models none of them\nhas reached a definitive conclusion. This uncertainty is in part\nbecause of to the difficulty of modeling of such explosive\nevents. We have assumed simple schematic parametrizations\nfor each of the environments as described below.\nOur nucleosynthesis code is based on the dynamical\nnetwork described in Meyer et al.

Neutrino-driven winds\nThe protoneutron stars born in Type II supernovae release\ntheir energy via neutrinos during their Kelvin-Helmholtz\ncooling phase. Those neutrinos heat up material on the\nsurface and eject them into a high-entropy bubble above\nthe neutron star. This is the so-called neutrino-driven wind\n(e.g., Refs. [15,36]). Because the energy of antielectron\nneutrinos is higher than electron neutrinos, the wind material\nbecomes slightly neutron-rich. If the entropy is high enough,\nit becomes a suitable environment for the main r pro-\ncess. Although this is a popular model, there are several\nproblems in this model. For example, it is still contro-\nversial as to whether such high entropy is actually real-\nized in the wind (e.g., Ref. [36] and reference there in).\nIn addition, Meyer et al.

There is essentially no effect from the flow through 6He in these models.\ninteractions with nuclei during the r process increases the\nelectron fraction. Higher entropy and\/or a shorter time\nscale may thus be necessary to realize suitable conditions\nfor the r process in this model when neutrino effects are\nconsidered.\nWe assume an exponential adiabatic expansion model for\nthe neutrino-driven wind. This model is often invoked in\nparametric studies of high-entropy environments (Ref. [35]).\nIn this model, the density and temperature profiles are given\nas\nT9 = 9.0 exp(\u2212t\/texp) + 0.6 (4)\n\u03c1 = 3.3 \u00d7 105T 39 \/S, (5)\nwhere T9 is the temperature in units of 109, texp is the expansion\ntime scale, \u03c1 is the baryon matter density in g\/cm\u22123, and S is\nthe entropy per baryon. We chose a parameter set of texp =\n0.05 sec and Ye = 0.45 and calculated different entropies of\nS = 100, 200, 300.\nFigures 6(a)\u20136(c) show the final abundance distribution for\nthe neutrino-driven wind model cases. There is essentially no\ndifference between these cases with three different network\ncalculations. The reason is simply that for higher-entropy\nenvironments the small binding energy of 6He means that the\nphotodisintegration of 6He is rapid and prohibits substantial\nreaction flow through 6He. From this analysis we conclude\nthat dineutron capture should have little influence on neutrino-\nenergized wind models for r-process nucleosynthesis, justify-\ning the neglect of this effect in earlier studies.\nB. Low-mass supernovae\nLow-mass core-collapse SNe (8\u201312 M\u0007) are another\ncandidate. If such low-mass supernovae explode, they would\noccur via a prompt explosion. During such prompt explosions,\nrelatively low entropy (\u223c15k), and a low electron fraction\n(Ye \u223c 0.2), can be realized (e.g., Refs. [11,16,17]). These are\nalso ideal conditions for the r process. The main objection\nto this model is the explosion mechanism itself. It is still\nunclear as to whether such light supernovae actually explode.\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that there is no convincing\nobservational evidence of the remnants of such explosions.\nFor these calculations, we have assumed that the material\nexpands exponentially, \u03c1 \u221d exp(\u2212t\/texp). Here, texp is the ex-\npansion time scale. Corresponding temperatures are obtained\nfrom the equation of state of Timmes and Swesty [18]. As used\nin previous studies, we adopted the entropy to be S = 15 and\nYe = 0.2.\nFigure 6(d) shows a result for the low-mass supernovae\nmodel. There is no significant difference between the three\nnetwork calculations.

These, however, did not change the conclusions\ndiscussed here.\nC. Neutron star mergers\nAnother neutron-rich environment could be realized in\nneutron star mergers (e.g., Ref. [4]). In this model the entropy\nis very low, but the electron fraction is also very low. It is\nthe most neutron-rich environment among the three mod-\nels considered here. Although theoretical calculations show\nreasonable yields, this model encounters some difficulties in\nexplaining the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy [10].\nFor the other two models, the heating from nucleosynthesis\ncan be shown to be negligible. However, in the neutron\nstar merger model, heating from \u03b2 decays and fission can\nsignificantly affect the temperature profiles. Because the\ncurrent version of our network code does not take heating from\nnucleosynthesis into account, we have assumed a constant\ntemperature T9 = 0.8, 1.0, 1.2. In other r-process calculations\nin the neutron star merger model, the temperature varies\nbetween 0.2 to 1.2 \u00d7109 K during the r process [4]. Hence,\na constant temperature is a reasonable assumption for our\npurposes of testing the impact of new nuclear reaction flows.\nInitial conditions for this model are from Tables 1 and 2 in,\nRef. [13]. Here, we assume that the material expands on a\nfree fall time scale (\u03b1 = 1.0) and the electron fraction is\ninitially set to Ye = 0.15 and an initial proton abundances\nYp = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124. We also calculated a model with a faster\nexpansion time scale (\u03b1 = 10) with a constant temperature\nT9 = 1.0, and Ye = 0.15.\nFigure 7 shows the abundance distribution in the low-\nentropy r process with three different network calculations.\nHere we see that dineutron capture can make some difference\nin the light nuclei with A < 130, but it is not significant\nfor heavier elements. Figure 8 shows the specific effects on\nthe abundances of 12C and 14C versus time in the case of\nT9 = 1.0, \u03b1 = 1.0. Here, we see that there are clear difference\nbetween the three different networks in the earlier stage\nof nucleosynthesis. However, it does not affect the final\nTABLE II.

This is because the environment is so neutron\nrich that fission recycling obscures the effects of all processes\nthat occurred at an earlier stage of nucleosynthesis.\nFission recycling plays a role in all models, but it is most\neffective for the neutron-star merger models. Note that there\nis no significant difference for elements heavier than the\nsecond r-process peak in the neutron-star merger model. If\nwe compare snapshots of each calculation, there are large\ndifferences at the early stage of nucleosynthesis. But those\ndifferences are obscured by fission recycling. This effect of\nfission recycling could be a hint to explain the apparent\nrobustness of the r process. Because our fission model is very\nprimitive, more realistic, systematic studies of fission recycling\nare needed for further discussion.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nThe sequential two-neutron capture process on 4He has\nbeen reevaluated on the basis of new experimental results.\nWe have calculated new reaction rates for the 4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He\nand 6He(\u03b1, n)9Be reactions in which resonant and nonresonant\ncontributions for both reactions have been taken into account.\nWe have shown that a one-step dineutron capture reaction may\nenhance the formation of 6He by several orders of magnitude.\nThis shows that neutron-skin or halo-structure configurations\nmay have an impact on reaction processes with neutron rich\nnuclei. However, these configurations are not highly bound\nand are easily depleted by inverse photodisintegration. In\nthe cases discussed here, the photodisintegration of 6He is\nso rapid that the effects of dineutron capture are manifest\nonly at very low temperatures and high neutron density.\nHence, it is unlikely that a significant reaction flow through\n4He(2n, \u03b3 )6He(\u03b1, n)9Be may occur in competition to the\n4He(2\u03b1, \u03b3 )12C and the 4He(\u03b1n, \u03b3 )9Be three-particle reactions\nfeeding the \u03b1 process.\nWe have analyzed the consequences of such dineutron\ncapture in the context of schematic models for r-process nucle-\nosynthesis. We have shown that this new reaction channel is not\nsignificant for the high-entropy neutrino-driven wind model\nor the low-mass supernovae model. It does, however, have a\ndiscernible influence on the production of seed material in neu-\ntron merger models with very low-entropy low-temperature\nconditions. Although this new reaction flow does not have\na large impact on the final abundances, there are significant\ndifferences at the earlier stage of nucleosynthesis. Although\nour calculation neglected heating from nucleosynthesis and\nadopted a primitive fission model, we could tentatively\nconclude that the new reaction flow might impact the final\nabundances under low-entropy, low-temperature conditions\nsuch as may occur in neutron star mergers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWork at the University of Notre Dame supported by the\nNational Science Foundation through grant PHY02-16783\nthrough the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA).\nOne of the authors (G.J.M.) acknowledges support from the\nU.S. Department of Energy under Nuclear Theory Grant\nDE-FG02-95-ER40934.\n[1] G.
