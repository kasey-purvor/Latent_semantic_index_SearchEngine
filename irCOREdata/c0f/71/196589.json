To study the functions of the mismatch repair protein Mlh2p in meiosis, we constructed mlh2\u0394 strains and measured rates of crossing over, gene conversion, post-meiotic segregation and spore viability. We also analysed mlh1\u0394, mlh3\u0394, msh4\u0394, msh5\u0394, exo1\u0394 and mus81\u0394 mutant strains singularly and in various combinations. Results: Loss of MLH2 resulted in a small but significant decrease in spore viability and a significant increase in gene conversion frequencies but had no apparent effect on crossing over. Deletion of MLH2 in mlh3\u0394, msh4\u0394 or msh5\u0394 strains resulted in significant proportion of the \u201clost\u201d crossovers found in single deletion strains being regained in some genetic intervals. We and others propose that there are at least two pathways to generate crossovers in yeast (Ross-Macdonald and Roeder, 1994; Zalevsky et al., 1999; Khazanehdari and Borts, 2000; Novak et al., 2001; de los Santos et al., 2003). Most recombination intermediates are processed by the \u201cmajor\u201d, Msh4-dependent pathway, which requires the activity of Mlh1p\/Mlh3p\/Msh4p\/Msh5p as well as a number of other proteins.
