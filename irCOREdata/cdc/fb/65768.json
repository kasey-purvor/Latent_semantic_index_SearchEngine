The paper argues that future policies \nand projects would do well to consider deliberative democracy in guises appropriate to rural \nBangladesh.  This must include better information availability and opportunities for participation at \nthe village level, for instance in civic science.  The overall conclusion is that pragmatic principles are \nhelpful in promoting community-focused mitigation measures but that accountability is essential if \npolicies are to avoid problems of local power, patronage and clientelism. \n \nKeywords: arsenic; water; environmental health; South Asia; Bangladesh; governance; pragmatism\n 3\n\u201cArsenic is a metalloid whose name conjures up images of murder\u201d (Oremland and Stolz, 2003, p. \n939). \n \n1. Introduction \n \nWith its vast, intersecting problems of poverty and environmental vulnerability, and a limited \nadministrative capacity, the government of Bangladesh has struggled to formulate and implement a \nnational water policy.  This failure has been so comprehensive that Geof Wood (1999, p. 734) has \ncommented acidly that \u201cpolicy towards water is too important to be left only to those traditionally in \ncharge of it\u201d.  The legitimacy of the elected government itself is perhaps questionable when there is \nsuch neglect of both the national interest and the interests of water users and consumers, but some \nargue that the recent reshaping of environmental sovereignty in Bangladesh into a new form shared \nbetween local politicians, NGOs and the aid industry means that we must reassess governance in \nterms of an ethics of distributed responsibility (Wood, 1997). \nWater is a well-known hazard in Bangladesh, with riverine floods causing annual disruption \nand death, but this paper will investigate a different aspect of water policy and practice.  Pollution by \none of the trace elements in the groundwater has caused a major environmental health emergency.  \nThis started in a low-key fashion. \n \n \u201cAbout six or seven years ago blisters developed on my whole body and there was a lot of \nitching.  A few months later, these blisters turned into black spots on my hands and legs.  \nThey itched and there was some pain.  A few years later, these black spots became hard and \nrough.  Now they have turned into sores\u201d (In-depth interview, Basiapara village, 2001).   \n \nThe experience of this patient is now a common one across Bangladesh, due to chronic \narsenic poisoning.  So far, 38,380 people have been diagnosed as having arsenicosis (BAMWSP, \n2004a) but the expectation is that the figure will rise to two million as patients present with a complex \nvariety of symptoms, including internal cancers (Yu et al., 2003).  Estimates of the total number at risk \nvary from 28 to 57 million (BGS and DPHE, 2001) of the 100 million who drink water from \ntubewells, spread across most districts except for the eastern hills.1  A national screening programme, \nmainly undertaken by the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP), but with \ninputs also from UNICEF, DANIDA, WorldVision, the Watsan Partnership Project, and the Asia \nArsenic Network, in 270 thanas, has found that water in 29.12 per cent of the 4.9 million tubewells \n 4\ntested was polluted to unsafe levels.  The most challenged district is Chandpur, near the mouth of the \nGanges, which has serious pollution of 93.00 per cent of its tubewells, with some thanas up to 98.62 \nper cent. \nThis poisoning is the result of complex geochemical interactions in the Holocene sediments \nthat comprise much of the surface layers of the deltas of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna and other \nrivers, and therefore West Bengal is affected as well as Bangladesh.  Generally speaking, the aquifers \nto a depth of 100 metres are more polluted than those at depths greater than 200 metres, by an order \nof magnitude.  Drinking water is extracted through small diameter metal or PVC pipes and the \nconcentration of arsenic depends upon this depth but also upon horizontal variations in space.  As we \nhave noted, there is a regional component to this, but there are also micro-scale differences, \nsometimes between tubewells sunk within metres of each other.   \n It is important to mention that the conjoined deltas of the Bay of Bengal are not alone in \nexhibiting this environmental health emergency.  The arsenic poisoning of groundwater is also a \nserious issue in other parts of South Asia, and also in Taiwan, Argentina, Chile, western China and \neven the United States.  What is exceptional in Bangladesh is the weak response of its hollowed out \nand inefficient state.  Other countries also have problems with corruption and dysfunctional \ngovernance but it is interesting to note that West Bengal, with a very similar set of geochemical \ngroundwater conditions, has managed to mount a more effective response due to the committed \nstance of its state government.    \nAs we will see, the weight of indeterminacy in the science and technology surrounding the \narsenic pollution in Bangladesh is significant (Atkins et al., 2006a).  Reaching agreement about an \nappropriate framework of policy has, as a result, proved to be difficult, exacerbated by political and \nbureaucratic problems with delivery.  We propose a mode of enquiry that owes much to the \npragmatism of John Dewey (1859-1952) and to the recent turn to \u201cenvironmental pragmatism\u201d \ninitiated in the path-breaking book of Light and Katz (1996).  Pragmatism, divided by some into the \npalaeo-pragmatism of Dewey, Peirce and James, and the recent, neo-pragmatism of Rorty, is a vast \nand complex enterprise.2  For our purposes, it yields two practical principles that will inform our \ndiscussion.   \nFirst, there is the primacy of action and practice.  The process of knowing is seen by Dewey as \na transaction (Sleeper, 1986); \u201ctruth\u201d is constituted in social procedure and theory is collapsed into \npractice. The judgment of progress is thus only meaningful as a review of practical \u201cexperimentation\u201d, \nwhich may take various forms, including activities as diverse as science and democracy.  According to \n 5\nWilliam James, \u201cthe significance of an idea is in the way it directs new observation and new \nexperience\u201d (Barbalet, 2004, p. 338). Experimentation leads to a balanced sensitivity to both hope and \nfailure, without the bitterness, guilt or violent anger that has accompanied the assessment of negative \noutcomes in some ideologies.   \nPragmatism has a keen sensitivity to context, as one would expect with a philosophy that has a \nrelational ontology.  Lived experience is prioritized over idealism and this leads to a refreshed view of \nempiricism, not as naive positivism but as a goal-orientated radical project seeking to engage with the \nworld.  Valuable though they are, pragmatism is not content with investigations of the conflicting \ninterests at stake in a situation such as the arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh, nor with representational \nor discursive analytical strategies (Baert, 2003).  There is an urge for practical engagement: for \ninstance, the profound influence that Dewey has had upon American educational theory.  William \nJames, in particular, spoke of the \u2018cash value\u2019 of theories in terms of their practical consequences.  \nSecond, concerns for conflict resolution and for community values make pragmatism a natural \ncontributor to environmental debates (Rosenthal and Buchholz, 1996).  The aim is not to develop \nuniversal ethical principles but to find a situationist and interactionist approach, even though this \nrarely yields certainties or argumentative closure (B\u00e9natou\u00efl, 1999).  Because knowledge is active and \nagency is conceived as a network of beliefs and attitudes, the associated politics are likely to be \nparticipatory.  Deliberative democracy through citizenship, particularly as conceived by J\u00fcrgen \nHabermas, is consonant with pragmatism.  Community politics are essential to encourage \nparticipation in achieving environmental goals because they convey a sense of ownership and practical \nengagement.  Although not a pragmatist himself, Habermas is willing to acknowledge a debt to Peirce, \nJames, Dewey and Mead, the best known of the \u201cclassical\u201d pragmatists: \u201cI have relied on this \nAmerican version of the theory of praxis when the problem arises of compensating for the weakness \nof Marxism with respect to democratic theory\u201d (Habermas, cited in Aboulafia 2002, p. 2).  He also \nshares with them the view that rationality requires dialogue and \u201ccommunicative action\u201d and Ingram \n(2002, p. 83) argues that Habermas learned from them that \u201cknowledge is something acquired by \npersons in reasoning together\u201d.  As a result he has, throughout his philosophical output, suggested \nthat \u201cnot bureaucratic hierarchy but participatory democracy is the best framework for problem-\nsolving\u201d. \nBearing these principles in mind, we will begin the paper with a brief analysis of the key issues \nof Bangladeshi governance, drawing on the literature which suggests that development has stalled \nbecause of poor administration, corruption and lack of accountability.  Second, we narrate an \n 6\nhistorical geography of arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh and look at responses to it at various levels, \nwith special reference to the World Bank\u2019s BAMWSP.  This is followed by an interlude in which we \nreflect on the need fully to grasp the indeterminacy of the associated science and technology if policies \nare to be acceptable and successfully implemented.  The focus then shifts to the possibilities for \ndemocracy to provide a way forward, through the concepts of affected publics, deliberation and \nparticipation.  Our conclusions raise certain pragmatic issues, including a recapitulation on ethics and \ndistributed responsibility, one of the most important considerations arising from the arsenic crisis. \n \n2. Circuits of governance in Bangladesh \n \nThe trope of illness often informs our metonymic image of Bangladesh.  The social and moral \ndecay implicit in that country\u2019s position at the top of the world\u2019s league table of corruption \n(Transparency International, 2005) is now paralleled by the new environmental sickness of arsenic, a \nhealth scandal on a global scale and even potentially \u201cthe end of a civilization\u201d in the absurdly lurid \nwords of one writer (Anwar, 2000).  In this extreme view, curing the diseased bodies may require \ncuring Bangladesh\u2019s dysfunctional system of governance because mobilizing resources and \nempowering energies at the local level are essential for both.  There is little sign of either happening so \nfar, and even the symbolic closure that all of us seek for our illnesses is absent (Herzfeld, 1986).  \nThere is no clinical cure presently available for chronic arsenic poisoning and most patients have been \ndeprived even of a prompt, accurate and sympathetic diagnosis (Hassan et al., 2004, 2005).  \nGovernment policy has been slow in the making and even slower in the implementation, to the extent \nthat the Dhaka Declaration of 2002, by the members of a major international conference on arsenic, \nnoted that \u201cno significant achievement [has] been reached so far regarding the supply of arsenic free \nsafe water to the people of Bangladesh\u201d (Quamruzzaman et al., 2002).   \nDemocracy in Bangladesh is a relatively recent phenomenon. Independence was achieved in \n1971 but the present parliamentary system only took shape in 1991.  The continuing enthusiasm of \nthe electorate is shown by their 75 per cent turn out in the General Election of 2001, but there is still \nmuch to learn about the modus operandi most suitable for policy-making, local government and the \nexercise of human rights.  The deeply antagonistic relations between the two major political parties \n(Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Awami League) has made peaceful and productive dialogue very \ndifficult, so that even basic institutions such as the civil service and universities have become \npoliticized to the point of breakdown.  Most serious of all is the failure of parliament to act as a forum \n 7\nfor the debate of major political issues, coupled with the absence of devolved power in any \nmeaningful form at the local level.   \nThe World Bank\u2019s 2002 publication, Taming Leviathan, is a devastating and timely critique of \nBangladeshi governance.  It finds, first, a pervasive patronage and clientelism that rewards loyalty \nrather than efficiency and which is self-serving rather than addressing public agendas.  This self-\ninterest reproduces itself at all levels and results, for instance, in a lack of cooperation between \nministries or agencies that should consult and have common programmes (Wood, 1999).  Second, \nthere are interest groups that have captured aspects of political decision-making and implementation, \nsome of whom go beyond lobbying and the manipulation of social capital into the darker realms of \nintimidation.  Virtually every proposal for reform encounters opposition from those who stand to lose \npower, status or opportunities for corrupt practices.  These people are few in number but well \norganized and influential, whereas the masses who would benefit from change are a largely silent \nmajority.  In order to circumvent this dysfunctional and rotten polity, donors have for the last two \ndecades been busy supporting NGOs as an alternative circuit of development delivery.  But, according \nto Taming Leviathan, the NGOs have also failed to optimize governance, having had little impact on \ncrucial needs such as strengthening the rule of law and supporting advocacy groups.  The authors \nargue that: \n\u201cto succeed, reform must benefit all the stakeholders whose cooperation is needed.  Because \nreformers have generally adopted a technocratic approach, and largely ignored the way \nincentives play out, the record of institution building is mixed \u2013 with few real successes and \nmany setbacks to learn from.  Effective incentives linked to real accountability are the key to \nbetter public sector performance\u201d (World Bank 2002, p. ii). \n \nThere are 257 registered NGOs providing arsenic mitigation services in Bangladesh and these \ngo some way to fill the gap left by state incapacity3; but they and the more general health NGOs \noperate in only about half of the country\u2019s village communities (Kaufmann, 2001).  If there ever was a \nhoneymoon between the rural poor and these NGOs, it is certainly over.  Respondents in our field \narea in Ghona Union of Satkhira District are bitterly critical of a narrow NGO focus on micro-credit \nto the exclusion of effective arsenic remediation (Hassan, 2003), and there are more general criticisms \nof their competitiveness and weak accountability (Hashemi, 1996; Karim, 1996; Haque, 2002).  Some \nof the larger NGOs, such as BRAC, Proshika and the Grameen Bank, have grown in size and \nmustered influence to match an industrial corporation or a government ministry, but their structural \n 8\nfaults, their stress upon professionalization, and a didactic style of relationship with the poor, has \ntaken them further from invigorating the institutions of civil society (White, 1999; Ahmad, 2002).  It is \nperhaps not surprising that NGOs in Bangladesh reflect both the problems and the hope of the \nbroader society (Mercer, 2002). \nBeyond the rarified political spaces of Dhaka there is significant physical and psychological \ndistance between the thana level of administration and the villages (World Bank, 2002).  This poses \npresently insurmountable difficulties for the efficient and timely application of policy.  Also, union \nparishads and their chairmen are not seen by the people as either impartial decision-makers or as \ncapable of providing adequate local services and the unelected gram sarkar introduced at village level \nin 2003 is seen by many as a cynical ploy by the governing party to bolster its influence in the \ncountryside.4  There are no satisfactory mechanisms of redress for their partiality and inaction, and \ncivil society is generally so weak that everyone must seek a patron in order to survive.  Corruption and \nclientelism, although they are judged by outsiders in a moral light, are in reality coping mechanisms in \na society where economic, social, political and environmental hazards are ever-present. \nBarenstein (1994; 2000, p. 1) rearticulates the current wisdom that socio-economic poverty in \nBangladesh is exacerbated by ineffective local governance.  He claims that the life chances of the \nexcluded majority will not improve unless they are brought into governance, \u201cstarting by the control \nof their immediate institutional surroundings and fair access to common assets and basic services, that \nis, by transforming the local power structures\u201d.  Barenstein\u2019s account stands out because of his \npragmatic advocacy of negotiation with local power brokers, whom he calls \u201ctropical robber barons\u201d, \nwith a view to reaching their clients, the rural poor.  This is because there is no evidence that \nclientelism is likely to decline in the near future; indeed, in the 1990s there was a trend away from \ntraditional autonomous village or union-level power bases towards politicization vertically through \nnational party hierarchies, with a ratcheting up of voter persuasion, including organized and \nwidespread intimidation.  As Dewey observed, such social facts are both \u201cobstacles and resources\u201d \n(Bohman, 2004, p. 37), and Platteau (2004) has argued that, while we must acknowledge the degree to \nwhich elites can hijack the benefits of community development aid, they often have tacit local support \nfrom poor and marginalized groups and so cannot easily be dethroned.  Instead, Platteau argues for a \nseries of measures that work within the status quo of distributed power but add layers of accountability \nthat are a learning experience for all concerned.   \nA further constraint in the governance of Bangladesh is its weak capacity at the centre.  \nRammelt and Boes (2004, p. 308) assert that there is a general \u201cweakness of governmental bodies in \n 9\nsolving problems within a reasonable time\u201d.  Despite the employment of large numbers of civil \nservants and agency staff, there has been insufficient investment in technical and managerial skills and \nthe Department of Public Health Engineering, initially charged with solving the arsenic problem, is \nsaid to have been hopelessly out of its depth (Patel, 2001).  Some institutional capacity was established \nthrough the BAMWSP funded by the World Bank from 1998 to 2006 but, generally speaking, \ncentrally coordinated governmentality has largely failed and responsibility for arsenic remediation has \nbeen devolved ad hoc to a combination of NGOs and overseas donor agencies, who operate in a \nbalkanized patchwork of client spaces that bear a startling resemblance to colonial territoriality (Figure \n1).5  What has happened here amounts to an unbundling of sovereignty that can be seen, either as an \nincapable and reluctant state shifting its responsibility to more willing franchises, or, more generously, \nas the state \u201cjoining with non-state actors in ambitious experiments seeking to address \nproblems\u2026through multi-party collaborative governance arrangements\u201d (Karkkainen, 2004).  Either \nway, Bangladesh has now become a unique multiperspectival polity in the sense of Ruggie (2000) and \nBohman (2004). \n \n0 kilometres 100\nN\nDhaka\nB a y  o f  B e n g a l\nI N D I A\nI N D I A\nMYANMAR\nI N D I AB A N G L A D E S H\nBAMWSP\nDANIDA\nWPP\nUNICEF\nWVI\nAAN\n 10\n \nSteinberg (2003) proposes a spheres of influence model of environmental policy-making that \ntranscends simplistic explanations of success or failure based upon corruption, class\/caste\/tribal \nconflict, elite strategies, or exploitation by multinationals.  He prefers to note the successes of \nenvironmental movements in some countries derived from links between an international sphere of \ninformation and activism and a domestic sphere.  In his opinion, it is the indigenous groups who are \nbest able to forge such links and who achieve the most impressive outcomes.  In Bangladesh there is \nsome evidence to support this.  The Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers\u2019 Association was founded in \n1991 and has been successful in opposing a range of environmental violations.  In 2003 they were \nelected to the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s Global 500 roll of honour for their work in \npublic interest environmental litigation.  Their 38 key cases have included industrial pollution, \ncompensation for development projects and, recently, the arsenic pollution of groundwater.  Through \nthe Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers\u2019 Association\u2019s international contacts, a case was brought in \n2002 in the High Court in London against the Natural Environment Research Council, alleging \nnegligence by its subsidiary, the British Geological Survey, which in 1992 had produced a report on \nwater quality in certain regions but had not tested for arsenic (Davies and Exley, 1992).  Atkins et al. \n(2006b) discuss the case, which reached the House of Lords in 2006.6  For Bangladesh, it adds a new \ndimension to its spatialities of governance.  Mason (2005) suggests that use of the law in this way \namounts to a new accountability of environmental responsibility across borders, but, while most \ninternational environmental litigation has been at the level of state parties, the arsenic crisis shows the \neffective absence of a state.  The government has neither been sued for negligence in its trusteeship of \nthe common resource of water, nor has it been active in seeking redress on behalf of its consumer \ncitizens for the damage caused by arsenic poisoning.  It has played Banquo, a ghostly presence \nthreatening from the wings but having no tangible form or impact.  This can be seen as an instance of \nwhat Karkkainen (2004) calls post-sovereign environmental governance, reassigning powers and \nresponsibilities to non-state actors.  In the absence of governmental capacity and collective political \nwill, the duty of holding to account cross-boundary polluters and others causing environmental \ndamage falls to a kaleidoscope of voluntary and professional activists, operating without coordination \nand frequently conflicting in their goals.  \nEthically we would argue that there has been an absence of a duty of care to water consumers. \nWe dismiss Mythen\u2019s (2004, p. 35) gloomy assessment that in risk societies \u201cthe responsibility for \nestablishing harm rests with the victim\u201d but we do acknowledge that the restructuring of sovereignty \n 11\nin Bangladesh into a hybrid of multiperspectival governance has been at the expense of a \nprecautionary outlook and to the detriment of consumers\u2019 interests.  In the absence of clear leadership \nfrom either the government or the NGOs, society\u2019s first reaction has been to construct a tableau of \ndangerousness that has been used to justify driving sufferers into marginal social spaces and excluding \nthem from many activities, on the entirely false premise that arsenicosis is a contagious disease \n(Hassan et al., 2005).  This has been one of the most alarming aspects of the arsenic crisis.   \n \n3. Arsenic poisoning:  policies and projects \n\u201cThe global response to the arsenic crisis in the Bengal Delta has been marked by staggering inertia\u201d \n(Meharg, 2004, p. 19). \n \n Although the presence of arsenic in groundwater was known about in West Bengal in the \n1980s, it was not until large-scale testing in the 1990s that it came to light in Bangladesh (Table 1).  \nThe Kolkata Conference of 1995 was a turning point for Bengal as a whole, with general acceptance \nemerging that environmental health was threatened across a vast area.  Soon afterwards the World \nHealth Organization declared a major emergency and the issue took on the profile of a global crisis.   \n \n< Table 1 here > \n \nThe hazard itself had its origins decades ago with the tapping of aquifers that had arsenic \nnaturally present.  Millions of simple, hand-pump tubewells have since been sunk into the soft deltaic \nsediments with the intention of providing an alternative to the microbe-abundant surface ponds and \ndug wells that were used traditionally in rural areas.  Infant deaths from diarrhoeal and other water-\nborne diseases were at a peak in 1972 when the UNICEF agreed to help with funding for drilling \ntubewells.  In addition to their life-saving capacity, these tubewells, usually located in or close to \nhousehold compounds, were also very convenient, especially for women, who are the customary \ndrawers of domestic water supplies.  The discovery of the vast scale of the arsenic pollution about ten \nyears ago created a situation incompatible with the previous relationship between rural people and \ntheir groundwater.   Faith in yet another aid project was shattered,7 along with trust in one of the most \nimportant of unmediated \u2018natural\u2019 resources. Since then the government has been very slow, for a \nnumber of reasons, in gearing itself up for the nationwide programme that is clearly necessary to \nmitigate what has been called \u2018the largest mass poisoning of a population in history\u2019 (Smith et al., \n 12\n2000, p. 1093). \nA new National Water Management Plan was approved in March 2004, with a subsidiary \nNational Policy for Arsenic Mitigation, which empowers and mandates the government to \u201cfacilitate \navailability of safe and affordable drinking water supplies through various means\u201d and enunciates the \npolicy that \u201caccess to safe water for drinking and cooking shall be ensured through implementation of \nalternative water supply options in all arsenic affected areas. All arsenicosis cases shall be diagnosed \nand brought under an effective management system\u201d. There are sections in this document on well-\nscreening, identification and management of patients, mitigation, research, awareness-raising, and \nalternative, safe supplies. Potentially the most significant move is \u201ctowards decentralized planning and \ndelivery of safe water options and health services through the grass root level local government \ninstitutions\u201d but, whether this is a genuine move to empower the grassroots, or a fig leaf to cover the \ngovernment\u2019s embarrassment at its own incapacity, remains to be seen.  The associated \n\u201cImplementation Plan for Arsenic Mitigation in Bangladesh\u201d initiates an ambitious \u201cEmergency \nWater Supply Programme in Severely Arsenic Affected Areas\u201d, which aims to ensure at least one \nsecure source of safe water \u201cwithin a reasonable distance on an emergency basis\u201d per 50 families.  \nThis is to be completed within one year of the screening of wells in villages where more than 80 per \ncent of the tubewells are contaminated (BAMWSP, 2004b).  Awareness-raising is targeted at villages \nwhere more than 20 per cent of TW are contaminated.  The new, emergency water sources will be \nprovided free of charge by the government but the cost of operation and maintenance is a community \nresponsibility.     \nA funding framework for this mitigation strategy had been provided years before, in 1997, \nwhen the World Bank invested $44.4 million in the establishment of the BAMWSP (Table 1), \nprincipally to complete the emergency nationwide testing of all tubewells in Bangladesh.  This was to \nbecome the world\u2019s largest water monitoring project (Khouri and Chowdhury, 1999).  Second, there \nwere to be rapid health surveys to identify arsenicosis sufferers and refer them to the health services.  \nThird, the foundation of a National Arsenic Mitigation Information Centre was to plug the yawning \nknowledge and information gaps that were hampering the implementation of policy.   \nProgress with the BAMWSP was very slow at first and the World Bank is reported to have \nconsidered withdrawing its investment because of resistance and institutional inertia within the \ngovernment (Anon., 2005).  By 2001 water testing and patient diagnosis had taken place in only 30 \nthanas and only $2 million of the total had by then been disbursed.8  From the outset there is said to \nhave been the lack of a clear strategic plan and an absence of government leadership to coordinate \n 13\nactivities and provide momentum (Kaufmann et al., 2001), but the absence of an effective top-down \nblueprint may be a blessing in disguise because \u201ceach of the 60,000 villages suspected of being at risk \nwas likely to require a tailor-made solution\u201d (World Bank, 2000, p. 3).  The lateral spatial \nindeterminacy of the pollution is extraordinarily destabilizing for planners used to allocating funds to \nregions, especially when it is difficult to predict the level of poisoning in wells even a few metres apart \n(Hassan et al., 2003).   \nAfter a restructuring of the BAMWSP following its mid-term review in 2001, it seems that the \nWorld Bank now views the solutions to the arsenic crisis as likely to arise from a series of pragmatic \n\u201clearning by doing\u201d projects that might take ten to fifteen years to cover the country with sustainable \noptions (World Bank, 2002).  These options will be derived from experimental pilot projects mounted \n\u201cto determine the best methods to raise community awareness, set up local organizations, determine \nprocedures and guidelines for these community-based organizations to ensure transparency and \naccountability, help communities identify their needs, and come up with a feasible proposal\u201d.  \nGrowing evidence suggests that, if these projects are to be successful, they must be fully committed to \nengaging with water consumers in a participative conversation about: (a) risks and health \nconsequences; (b) mitigation alternatives; (c) location and maintenance of facilities; and, (d) cost and \nquality control.  Everyone consumes water, so every member of the community has a stake in this \ndebate.   \nAs already noted, the BAMWSP was charged with a major emergency screening programme \nbut by the end of 2004 only 4.95 million tubewells had been tested for the first time, less than half of \nthe total number (BAMWSP, 2004a).  One reason for the delay was the need to train a small army of \nfield workers.  Overall, 54,000 people, the vast majority of whom have only basic educational \nqualifications, have been trained to use field testing kits.  The results of the testing of every tubewell in \na thana are used to plan the next phase.  As noted above, if more than 80 per cent in an area are \ncontaminated, an emergency mitigation procedure is triggered, in which alternative safe water sources \nare provided.  By mid-2005 the BAMWSP had developed mitigation measures under about 3,000 \nCommunity Action Plans in 35 thanas and, under the emergency hot spot programme, in a further 29 \nthanas (Table 2) (BAMWSP, 2005).  In addition, the BAMWSP has trained 2,330 doctors and 12,590 \nhealth workers in the diagnosis of arsenicosis symptoms, but its commitment to awareness \nprogrammes has been disappointing; by late 2004 only six thanas had been targeted.9       \n \n< Table 2 here > \n 14\n \nAs we will see later, well-switching to the use of less contaminated tubewells and the sinking \nof community-based deep tubewells both have their problems in terms of access.  In the opinion of \nthe World Bank itself, these small-scale mitigation measures of the BAMWSP \u201cactually represent a \nstep backwards in terms of service delivery in Bangladesh because the rural population has become \naccustomed to the high service level associated with the privately-owned hand pumps in their yards\u201d \n(World Bank, 2004, p. 1).  Something better is needed and the usual preference stated by the \nconsumers is for piped water (Hoque et al., 2004) because of its convenience.  There are already 100 \nor so experimental piped water systems in rural Bangladesh, mostly provided by the Department of \nPublic Health Engineering, and experience indicates that, for nucleated villages with 200-300 \nhouseholds or more, this is likely to be a more cost-effective solution than the use of home-based \ntreatment systems (World Bank, 2003).  The BAMWSP is planning pilot piped schemes in 30 villages, \nwith half of the capital costs met centrally, 30-40 per cent from private enterprise, who would \nmaintain the networks, and 10-20 per cent from the consumers.  Using the contingent valuation \nmethod, Ahmad et al. (2002; 2005) found that rural people\u2019s willingness to pay for piped water was \ndirectly dependent upon their knowledge of arsenic and their level of concern.  Educational status was \nalso a determinant.  Their conclusions, from a carefully designed survey of 2,900 households in three \nareas, are that convenience is important, but that families in contaminated areas were willing to pay \nonly up to 0.2 per cent of their household income for arsenic-free, piped water. \nThe new Bangladesh Water Supply Programme Project was launched in June 2005.10  This is \nbacked by a further $40 million of World Bank funding and will build on lessons learned by the \nBAMWSP.  Four hundred and fifty large villages will be given piped water in a pilot scheme.  The cost \nwill be shared in a Water Users\u2019 Association between grant money (50 per cent), a local sponsor \n(NGOs, cooperatives, water companies), and the consumers.  The sponsors will operate local systems \nfor fifteen years in agreement with the WUA and the union parishad. The choice of the end point of \nthe pipes will be threefold: individual or shared standpipes, or household taps, depending on \naffordability for each household.  Water quality will be the responsibility of the Department of Public \nHealth Engineering.  Two hundred smaller villages in hot spot thanas will receive deep tubewells, dug \nwells and pond sand filters.  Union and Ward Arsenic Committees will be formed with the task of \nraising awareness and developing a Community Action Plan with details of mitigation measures, and \nthe project document explicitly states one of its objectives as an increasing sense of local ownership, \nthereby acting as a catalyst for political decentralization.  Each community must pay for 10 per cent of \n 15\ncosts and women and vulnerable groups must make up at least 30 per cent of the membership of the \nWard Arsenic Committee. The Bangladesh Water Supply Programme Project will pioneer a credit \nmarket for piped water systems in order to convince local banks of the demand for, and viability of, \nthis type of long-term loan.  This is a key point because poor households will not otherwise be able to \nafford the connection fee and water charges.  No doubt the World Bank is counting on people\u2019s \nincreasing familiarity with micro-credit due to the activities of the Grameen Bank and other NGOs, \nalthough we should note that this has been heavily criticized (Mallick, 2002).   \nTo date, NGOs have been involved with arsenic in one of two ways.  Either they have been \nworking independently with funding from foreign donors, or they have been surrogates, locally \ndelivering certain aspects of government policy.  With UNICEF funding, and the technical and \nlogistical help of the Department of Public Health Engineering and BRAC, tubewells in 43 thanas \nhave been screened.  BRAC employs local women as village health workers to operate field testing \nkits, identify arsenicosis patients, and raise awareness, the hope being that communities will listen to \ntheir own members (Patel, 2001). Other NGOs have been involved in a smaller way, such as the \nDhaka Community Hospital and World Vision, and funding has come from DANIDA and Britain\u2019s \nDepartment for International Development. By far the largest screening effort, however, has been by \nthe BAMWSP, working with small NGOs, and they have checked tubewells in 190 thanas.  NGOs \nhave been innovators in mitigation options, trying rainwater harvesting, dug wells, pond sand filters \nand some of the chemical treatment methods, but none of these seem to be as popular with \nconsumers as deep tubewells and piped water. \nOne final pragmatic point to make in this section is that an estimated death rate of 9,136 \npeople a year along with 174,174 disability-adjusted life years (Lokuge et al., 2004) from arsenicosis in \nBangladesh must be set against an estimated annual saving of approximately 5,500 diarrhoea-related \ndeaths by the use of bacteria-free ground water.  This begs the question whether making policy with \nregard to arsenic in isolation is both wasteful and misguided.  The arsenic problem is better seen in the \nround, as just one amongst the many environmental and general health challenges facing poor \nBangladeshis.  The fact that people continue to drink from red-marked tubewells shows clearly that \nthey perceive this as just one of the problems of their daily lives and often not the principal risk they \nface.  Related to this is the thought that the government and donors should pay more attention to the \ngeneral sanitary and nutritional environment of the afflicted people, rather than to expensive \ntechnological solutions such as chemical means of removing arsenic in water once it has reached the \nhousehold.  \n 16\n \n4. Technological indeterminacy and affected publics \n \n Geof Wood (1999) argues that water resource \u201cexperts\u201d have often in the past had \u201climited \nperceptions\u201d of the implications of their proposals for livelihoods. As a result, the imposition of hi-\ntech solutions with regard to water policy has occasionally proved to be disastrous in the Bangladesh \nsetting.  The Flood Action Programme (1989-95), for instance, is a notorious example of a hard \nengineering solution intended to tame nature.  It failed, in its first incarnation at least, to take account of \nits affected publics \u2013 a term introduced by Dewey (1927) to finesse the notion of accountability within \ndemocracy.  At the other end of the technological spectrum, the production of arsenic by a quarter of \nthe country\u2019s tubewells, is evidence of what Giddens (1991) has called the \u201cdark side of modernity\u201d, and \nit is typical of the technologies in Beck\u2019s \u201crisk society\u201d, having global reach, even to poor rural \nsocieties (Beck 1992; 1999).11   \n In their paper on arsenic mitigation strategies and policies, Alaerts and Khouri (2004) argue \nthat it is essential from the outset to recognize the indeterminacy of the science and technology \nassociated with the arsenic crisis.  We agree, and if all the stakeholders can assimilate this point, a set \nof pragmatic solutions will become possible; but pretence about the knowability of the problem is \ncounterproductive.  The best illustration of this is the safety limit for arsenic ingestion.  The threshold \nis set by the World Health Organization and the United States Environmental Protection Agency at \n0.01 mg\/l but by the Bangladeshi authorities at a more lenient 0.05 mg\/l.  There is a complex history \nbehind this, which is discussed by Smith and Smith (2004), but for our purposes we have to ask \nwhether the precautionary principle should be applied and therefore the more stringent limit enforced.  \nIt is certainly true that some writers argue that long-term exposure at 0.05 mg\/l is likely to lead to \nmorbidity, particularly the risk of cancer, but the Smiths remind us that this must be weighed against \nthe present inability of the government to provide alternative sources of clean water to replace the \nmillions of wells that would have to be taken out of service.  In reality, they suggest, a strict limit \nwould not be applied and there is a likelihood that there would be no protection at all in many areas.  \nTheir pragmatic judgment is that it is better, for an interim period at least, to have a standard that has \nsome realistic chance of application and cuts waterborne disease, and we would add that \naccountability for such a decision must come at the local level. \n Another example of indeterminacy is the spatial complexity of the arsenic pollution.  We \nhave shown (Hassan et al., 2003) that this risk can be mapped but predictive interpolation is \n 17\nproblematic because of significant variations between neighbouring wells, sometimes close together.  \nThree dimensional modelling can help here, taking into account the depth of the aquifers tapped, and \nthe detailed work of the BMWSP\u2019s Deep Aquifer Characterization and Mapping Programme in \nChandpur District will give us a good starting point for understanding the complexity.12  Van Geen, \nZheng et al (2003) make a valid point when they argue that setting a national minimum drilling depth \nfor new wells, as had been contemplated, would be inappropriate because circumstances vary so much \nwith each tubewell.  The more research that is done on arsenic in Bangladesh, the more one realizes \nthat blanket policies for mitigation are unsuited to a complex reality.13 \n The implications of complexity are felt by water consumers, yet many of them are unaware \nof their situation.  Apart from the poor circulation of information about risks in consuming \ncontaminated water and the symptoms of the resulting disease, there is also surprisingly little debate or \npublicly-expressed anger. This is probably because Bangladesh presently fails all of the tests of \ndeliberative democracy set by Festenstein (2004, p. 295), who argues pragmatically, first, that those \ntaking part in debate \u201care under obligation to offer arguments persuasive to all other participants\u201d.  In \ncontrast, the country\u2019s politics are confrontational and violence is frequently an instrument of first \nresort, such as the frequent hartals (general strikes) that are enforced against the will of the public.  \nSecond, he suggests that what matters is the force of the better argument rather than bargaining \npower; but in Bangladesh it is networked influence that settles issues, not open debate.  Third, he \nindicates that acceptable policies should be achieved by compromise \u2013 in reality the programme \nformulated in isolation by one party is consigned to the dustbin when they lose a general election.  As \na result, the country is deprived of the process of public discussion, and the state not only evades its \nresponsibility to achieve the best possible judgments, but there is a reduced chance that policies will \nbe accepted and laws obeyed. \n Two problems with encouraging the circulation of information are that our knowledge of \nthe social science of arsenic in Bangladesh is very thin and that some of the science is controversial \n(Hanchett 2004).  In view of this, it is surprising that the World Bank has committed over $80 million \nwithout much depth of information about the technological and logistical systems that will best match \nthe realities of situated power and knowledge in the field.  Hassan (2003) has shown that intimate local \nawareness coupled with several months of fieldwork can yield significant dividends in understanding \nthe issues in one union from both the ethnographic and technical points of view, and we suggest \nfurther research of this nature into the socio-economic context of arsenic pollution.  Without \nunderstandings of the impact of arsenic on people\u2019s lives and livelihoods, and how arsenicosis is \n 18\nperceived, we feel that policies will founder on the Scylla of indifference, fear, prejudice and other \nnegative emotions that have been identified as hindering appropriate community and public health \nresponses (Hassan et al., 2005). \n With regard to practical methodologies of enquiry, Rosenboom\u2019s (2004) close study of \nfifteen thanas is a balanced, reflective and careful analysis and provides guidance for other countries in \nthe region seeking a model.  But we need to go further and push the epistemological boundaries, to \nexperiment with new modes of enquiry and to forge much closer ties between the geoscience and the \nsocial science of arsenic. This will only be possible, however, if relevant funders can be found.  If \nreception theory were applied to the development industry, we would probably find that at present \ninternational donors and their client governments or NGOs are captured more by headlines \nconcerning ongoing health crises such as HIV\/AIDS or by immediate environmental disasters like an \nearthquake or a tsunami, than they are by every-day and low profile basic needs such as water and \nsanitation, which find it difficult to compete for attention and for cash.  This means that learning from \nemergencies such as arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh is problematic because the events tend to unfold \nmore quickly than the response.  Only with a good knowledge base and a strong form of grassroots \nself-help is it conceivable that solutions can be rolled out speedily and appropriately for local \ncircumstances and be made to stick. \n \n5. Deliberative democracy? \n \n Dewey\u2019s idea that democracy is \u201can experimental form of practical enquiry\u201d means that it is \nwell suited to problem-solving (Bohman, 2004, p. 28).  Dewey also argued that democracy should not \nbe tied solely to formal institutions and that it might derive strength and inspiration from the \ndecentring tendency of multiple publics.  What form should this take for the nascent, fragile \ndemocracy of Bangladesh?  We will make four points here. \n First, pragmatism has much in common with participatory action research (Reason and \nBradbury, 2001).  According to Peter Reason, this involves \u201cbuilding democratic, participative, \npluralist communities of inquiry\u201d (Reason, 2003).  In terms of data collection and the communication \nof risk\/health messages, the available methods used are many and varied, the object being to involve \nlocal people at every stage, taking into account what Hardin (2003) calls their street level \nepistemology, rather than regarding them as the passive objects of an arm\u2019s length study (Chambers, \n1983).  Qualitative approaches are common but in our opinion there is room also for advanced \n 19\ntechnologies if they serve a purpose.  Thus, we propose a system of participatory Geographical \nInformation Systems at the level of the union or the thana that would record arsenic data and would \nbe public property, with civic rights of access (Hassan, 2005).  Particularly important would be access \nto any risk maps that might be produced, informing householders of pollution generally in their area.14 \nSuch a system would be labour- and skill-intensive, expensive and in constant need of updating, but \ninformation-sharing is a crucial weapon in the armoury of democracy and one can imagine a \nparticipatory GIS being extended to other aspects of poverty and vulnerability mapping, resource \ninventory, and the planning and monitoring of local service delivery.15   \n Second, to pragmatists \u201call problems are problems of conduct and all judgments are \nimplicitly judgments of value\u201d (Barker, 2004, p. 447).  Therefore pragmatism privileges ethics \u2013 in the \nhuman-centred sense of taking an interest in environmental ethics from the point of view of \u2018the \nenvironment as the location of human community\u2019 (Light, 2002), rather than the non-human value \ntheory of many modern environmental ethicists.  In this context, we feel it is important that each \nindividual tubewell owner should be informed of the level of pollution of their water, although the \nresults will be upsetting for the 30 per cent whose tubewells are unsafe, many of whom invested a lot \nin drilling, and explaining the safety implications will be time-consuming.  But there is an ethical \ndimension here that cannot be ignored.  Testing water is not a purely scientific exercise; it is, or should \nbe, a joint enterprise between the owner and the investigator and the latter must forfeit exclusive \nintellectual property rights over the data.  In addition to these rights of the individual, there are, in our \nopinion, rights of the community over databases and resulting analyses.  Hoque et al. (2000) have \nexpressed similar views as a result of their action research in Manikganj. \n Third, we follow B\u00e4ckstrand (2003), who formulates a persuasive argument for what she \ncalls \u201ccivic science\u201d.  This comprises several elements.  There is civic science as participation in which \nthe public is engaged, as individuals and through civil society, in participatory technology assessment \nand other means of inclusive\/democratic environmental risk management.  In Hajer\u2019s (1995) account \nof ecological modernization, he posits an institutionalized type of \u201csocietal inquiry\u201d, which would \nprovide a forum for the balanced presentation of views and the degree of ownership of the process \nthat is necessary for participation.  We don\u2019t think that large-scale formal events would be appropriate \nin rural Bangladesh, but Kar (2003) has shown that an equivalent community-based and self-\nmotivated method of investigating and improving sanitation has been very successful.  In the words of \nLeach and Scoones (2003, p. 12), it is \u201ccitizenship as practised engagement through emergent social \n 20\nsolidarities\u201d.  In this sense, citizenship is not a static phenomenon but rather a learning process that \nreveals and enhances capabilities (Merrifield, 2002). \n B\u00e4ckstrand suggests that improved communication is one pay-off from civic science.  In a \nsituation where levels of information about arsenic poisoning are generally very poor, it makes sense \nfor the various providers of mitigation to consider public education, transparency and technological \naccountability.  This is very far from being straightforward because, as Alaerts and Khouri (2004) \nindicate, there is a fine balance to be struck in public health messages between, on the one hand, blunt \ndescriptions of a crisis that may cause alarm and panic and, on the other hand, emollient statements \nthat encourage complacency or even denial.  These writers favour the encouragement of dialogue \nbetween water consumers and official or NGO information providers.  Public hearings are one \nsuitable forum, backed up with advertisements on radio and television, village-level dramatizations, \nand various other activities.  What matters here is understanding and trust, and there is space for both \nto be built in a spirit of pragmatic experimentation rather than in the top-down, programmatic fashion \nthat has failed in the past.  This would leave flexibility for the incorporation of local knowledges and \ncontingent socio-economic circumstances.  Inevitably in Bangladesh, where civil society is much \nstronger in some districts than others, responses to participation will vary.  Under conditions where \nthere has been widespread political intimidation, for instance, or the elite capture of development \nprojects, it is difficult to see how participative science could work.  However, these conditions are not \nuniversal and the BAMWSP has made a start on an institutional make-over with their use of \ncommunity-based organizations such as water users\u2019 associations.   \nA key here is public information.  Government campaigns on the television have been \ninstrumental in raising awareness in recent years (APSU, 2003), even in areas not seriously affected by \nthe crisis.  But there are hard-to-reach groups among the poor, the non-literate, and the socially \nmarginalized, for whom information has to be carefully and sensitively tailored.  Also women, \nespecially rural housewives, whose mobility and voice are culturally constrained, are less likely than the \naverage to have access to arsenic-related information, yet they bear the burden of water collection.  \nOverall these characteristics matter because they are correlates of whether families are willing and able \nto change to safe water supplies upon receipt of a message that their own source is contaminated. \nIn the spirit of Dewey, McAfee (2004, p. 53) notes that \u201cpublic deliberations usually spend a \ngreat deal of time developing a public picture of what a problem is\u201d. In other words, deliberative \ndemocracy cannot proceed without everyone understanding where they stand in relation to an issue \nand what their interests are vis \u00e0 vis others and the community at large (Figueroa et al., 2002).  No \n 21\ninformation means no calculation, no interest, no deliberation and no action.  It is only through \ndeliberation that we hear the views of others and therefore make the kind of contingent decisions that \nin aggregate make for consensus (Smith, 2003).  Deliberative democracy therefore seeks to transcend \nself-interest as the sole ground for politics and replace it with inclusive public reason (Bohman and \nRehg, 1997; Dryzek, 2000; 2004; Baber, 2004).  \nThere is some evidence at the village level in Bangladesh that there is scope for self-motivated \nenquiry and demand for appropriate solutions.  Duyne (2004), for instance, discusses at length \nexamples of community-led water management initiatives that belie the stereotypical image of \nhopelessness at the grassroots, and Hoque et al. (2000) suggest that the village Watsan Committees \nformed with UNICEF funding by local NGOs offer opportunities for strengthening institutions at \nthe local level.  They found positive signs of participation, especially as a result of work by women \nvolunteers who held courtyard meetings and encouraged their fellow villagers to take the Watsan \nmessages seriously.  Not all Watsan village-level committees are necessarily active but the government \nwas sufficiently impressed by the results of the UNICEF initiative that in 2002 it set up a framework \nfor the establishment of further Watsan Committees at union, thana and district levels.16   \nThere are more examples of successful participatory projects on arsenic.  One is a Swiss \nDevelopment Corporation project in north west Bangladesh, which Hanchett (2004) reports upon \nfavourably.  As an explicit objective, this initiative seeks to empower local decision-making.  What the \nliterature is lacking, however, is accounts of action research at the frontier of participation.  We are \nnot aware of any participatory GIS, as we have outlined above, nor does Bangladesh yet have post-\nstructural participatory methods as discussed by Cameron and Gibson (2005).  The latter would be \nespecially interesting because this approach enables novel understandings of the subjectivity of \nrespondents, for instance through their embodied practices.   \n Our advocacy of participation is certainly not starry-eyed.  It would be foolish and \ndishonest, for instance, to claim that all types of poor, rural people would benefit.  As Wood (2003) \npoints out, poverty is heterogeneous and the capacity for self-help action is extremely varied.  Also, \nsince illiteracy in the country is 58.9 per cent overall, and 68.6 per cent for women, there is a \npossibility of false consciousness, where, without the benefit of a process of a Freireian-style \nconscientization, people may not be fully informed about their interests in the national and global \ncontext of environmental responsibility.  Outside the realms of \u2018participation\u2019, some people may \nrequire the continued mediation of others in their family or neighbourhood in order to make their \nvoices heard, for instance women in the highly conservative setting of rural Bangladesh.  An example \n 22\nof this point is the well-switching advocated by writers such as van Geen et al. (2002). In Satkhira \nDistrict, Hassan (2003) found that, in contrast to these authors\u2019 optimism, access to water from public \ndeep tubewells was being denied to arsenicosis sufferers.  These tubewells are looked after by paid \ncustodians who, in many cases, use this position as a lever of power within the community, choosing \nwho to include or exclude. Thus the people who need pure water most are often being denied access \nand are thrown back on their own contaminated shallow tubewells, with the seemingly inevitable \nresult that their health will suffer in the long-term.  Bearak (1998) found similar problems of micro-\nscale conflict, with one of his respondents declaring that \u201cIf I die, I will die, but I will not go to fetch \nwater from another man\u2019s house\u201d. \n We are also conscious of the recent criticisms of participatory research.  The Panglossian \nbubble of participatory social science fieldwork was burst by Cooke and Kothari (2001) in their book, \nParticipation: the new tyranny.  They and their contributors found an over-romanticized view of \nindigenous knowledge amongst participation activists, and, as Cameron and Gibson (2005) remind us, \nthese so-called \u201cauthentic\u201d local understandings are in fact multiply produced and cannot be \nguaranteed to be positively transformative. This scepticism is echoed by Richard Rorty (1979), who is \ndismissive of participative democracy, which he claims is vaguely defined and ineffective in achieving \nreform (Green, 2004).  He prefers instead campaigns linked to specific ends.  Certainly one can see in \nBangladesh that the government has tended to use participation as a means of consultation or \npersuasion, rather than as a means of agenda-setting or empowerment (Wood, 1999).  They have been \nreluctant so far to devolve budgets and decision-making to local officials, let alone to the grass roots, \nand have generally not encouraged civic maturity. \nFourth, time and latency are elements of the arsenic story that have been neglected.  One \ncould argue, for instance, as does Daniel Deudney (1998), that it is important to consider affected \npublics in intergenerational terms, so that an environmental harm present now raises issues of \nresponsibility with regard to future consumers of water, and also future farmers of soil that is now \nbeing contaminated with arsenic-laced irrigation water (Hossain, 2006).  More broadly, we can see \nboth hazards and resources as subspecies of latency.  They present us with threats and opportunities \nthat may or not be fulfilled.  Some hazards, such as the riverine floods of Bangladesh, are both \nfamiliar and predictable.  By contrast, arsenic poisoning is insidious, quotidian and, according to the \nBGS\/NERC, nothing about it seems to have been foreseen or foreseeable.  Even now, its full extent \nand import remain unclear.  Heidegger (1962, p. 231) summed up the principle well:  \n \n 23\n\u201cwhen something threatening brings itself close, anxiety does not \u2018see\u2019 a definite \u2018here\u2019 or \n\u2018yonder\u2019 from which it comes\u2026That which threatens cannot bring itself close from a definite \ndirection\u2026it is already \u2018there\u2019, and yet nowhere; it is so close that it is oppressive and stifles \none\u2019s breath, and yet it is nowhere\u2026What oppresses us is not this or that, nor is it the \nsummation of everything present-at-hand; it is rather the possibility of the ready-to-hand; that \nis to say it is the world itself\u201d. \n \nIn a sense this point relates to trust and risk-taking.  The credibility of the arsenic testing \nagencies is insecure in the minds of many people.  When told that their water source is contaminated, \nsome villagers ignore the information because no-one in their family or neighbourhood is visibly \nunwell.  The concept of latency requires careful discussion with those whose lives are constantly \nimpinged by imminent risk and who apparently discount the saving of lives as little as ten years into \nthe future (Poulos and Whittington, 2000).  It seems that delays before symptoms of arsenicosis \nappear are as difficult for them to take seriously as the link between cigarettes and lung cancer was for \nwestern smokers in the 1950s and 1960s.  The addiction in the case of tubewell water is convenience, \nand any associated risks may therefore seem to some to be well worth taking. \n \n6. Conclusion \n \n We see the problem of arsenic pollution as a microcosm of the wider challenge of \nBangladeshi governance, for instance as illuminated in several publications by Geof Wood, most \nnotably his account of \u2018prisoners and escapees\u2019 (Wood, 2000).  Here he convincingly demonstrates \nthat the country\u2019s widespread administrative failure is institutional rather than organizational, and he \nsuggests a look into the deep structures of society for explanations and solutions.  The sluggishness of \ngovernmental response to groundwater pollution is not surprising in such an analysis.  It is not \nnecessarily a function of the special characteristics of geological strata or of the scale of the chemical \nhazard but rather due to the obstinate strength of what might be termed \u2018unsocial\u2019 capital in the mal-\nperformance of the state.  Wood argues that the Bangladeshi polity needs a change in the centre of \ngravity from government to governance, with a greater emphasis upon the determinants of state \npractice. \n Both the study of the arsenic problem and attempts to find solutions must in our view be \ncommunity-focused experiments.  As Cutchin (1999, p. 271) remarks, \u201cwe cannot discover most of \n 24\nthe answers without entering into place and observing and asking the community members to tell us \ntheir stories\u201d.  This means a central emphasis on participation, civic science and deliberative \ndemocracy at the local level. Our fieldwork also suggests that community awareness of the issues is \nessential if participatory action research is to meet its objectives.   \n There are times when local elites can hamper or prevent change and, according to Mansuri \nand Rao (2004), the success of community-based initiatives depends upon a number of factors:  an \nenabling institutional environment; a committed approach by donors that is sensitive to local power \nstructures; and the accountability of community and project leaders to their constituents and clients.  \nIncrementalism is the best way forward in the light of all three of these factors but this should not be \na vulgar pragmatism of either utilitarianism or expediency but rather a critical pragmatism that \nrecognizes multiple viewpoints and interests and tries to negotiate a path of maximum hope (Rorty, \n1999).17  Transparency and accountability, for instance, can be facilitated by journalism, but long-term \nopenness requires vigilance and pressure from local activism, and national campaign groups and policy \nthink tanks (Wood, 2000). \n NGOs represent a widely distributed alternative circuit of governance, and, faute de mieux, \nthere is no doubt that they must be involved in providing analytical and mitigation services.  But it \nseems that NGOs have also become part of problem in some areas, working to alien agendas with \nresources that are stretched beyond capacity to meet local needs for inexpensive, safe water.  What is \nneeded is a more sophisticated response to the arsenic crisis, starting with support from the larger \nNGOs for an increased intensity of litigation, along the lines of the Bangladesh Environmental \nLawyers\u2019 Association, and also a substantial boost for the creation of a collective self-awareness that is \nclearly lacking for arsenic and several other environmental health issues.   \n In November 2004 the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare declared that \u201ca viable, long-\nterm solution to Bangladesh\u2019s arsenic problem is not yet in sight\u201d (MOHFW, 2004, p. 5).  These \nremarks on the failure of other ministries left the authors themselves in the clear but ignored the \nprogress that is now being made by the restructured BAMWSP and the laudable aims of the nascent \nBangladesh Water Supply Programme Project. Whether water consumers gain in the long term \nremains to be seen but, contrary to the unfortunately negative image of Bangladesh, there is plenty of \nevidence of self-help.  Coupled with outside support for expensive projects such as the provision of \ndeep wells and piped water schemes, this gives cause for optimism.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n 25\nThe authors are very grateful to Professor John McArthur for his critical reading of an earlier draft \nand to the editor, Professor Paul Robbins, and three anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions.  \nThey bear no responsibility for the opinions expressed here or for any factual inaccuracies.

The union parishad is a representative committee with certain administrative powers. \nThe gram sarkar is a committee of fifteen members nominated by the government and represents a \nparallel authority to the union parishad.  Its declared intent was to give villagers a greater say in their \nown development. There was confusion from the outset about their division of responsibilities and \nmuch political dispute.  In 2005 the gram sarkar was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.   \n5   At the national level, the Local Government Division\u2019s Arsenic Policy Support Unit has \nresponsibility for coordinating the various screening and mitigation programmes; the Inter-Ministerial \nTask Force and Secretaries\u2019 Committee guides the multi-sector response; and the Arsenic Donor \nCoordination Unit guides development partners\u2019 responses. \n6   The appeal was dismissed (House of Lords, 2006). \n7   Respondents in our field area claimed that Department of Public Health Engineering officials have \nbeen taking money (Tk4,500) as part payment from each family wishing to have a deep tubewell.  \nThey issue only hand-written receipts, without any official signature or stamp.  No date is arranged for \nsinking the well and the people worry that this might be a scam. \n8   In May 2003 still only 31.3 per cent of the project funds had been spent (BAMWSP, 2003). \n9   35 more will be included in phase II and 147 in phase III. \n 38\n \n10   Implementation is by the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development & Cooperatives.  \n11   This does not mean that we are Luddites.  On the contrary, we acknowledge that tubewells have \nbrought benefits to Bangladesh and other developing countries but, like all technologies, they have the \npotential for harm if not properly applied. \n12   This uses isotope analysis to measure the age of the water and so distinguish between the \nPleistocene and Holocene aquifers. \n13    But there are underlying controls on arsenic distribution that can guide remediation. \n14   But see comments about problems with these risk maps in Atkins et al. 2006a. \n15   For more on participatory GIS, see the Community Mapping, PPGIS, PGIS, CiGIS and P3DM \nVirtual Library, <www.iapad.org\/bibliography.htm>, and the bibliography at \n<www.urisa.org\/PPGIS\/2003\/papers\/ppgis_bibliography.pdf> (both accessed: 18\/3\/06). \n16   This \u2018Rural Sanitation, Hygiene and Water Supply Project\u2019 is presently operating in 37 thanas.   \n17   For a helpful account of the vulgar pragmatism of cost benefit analysis, see Farber (1999). \n"}
