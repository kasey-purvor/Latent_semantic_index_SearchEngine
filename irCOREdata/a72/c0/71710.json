Field speciation data (116 examples) for Al in acid-to-neutral \nwaters can be accounted for, assuming that 60 - 70% (depending upon competition by iron, \nand the chosen fulvic acid : humic acid ratio) of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is due to \nhumic substances, the rest being considered inert with respect to ion-binding.

For the \nconditions considered, Al, which is present at higher free concentrations than Fe(III), \ncompetes significantly for the binding of Fe(III), whereas Fe(III) has little effect on Al \nbinding.  The principal form of Al simulated to be bound at low pH is Al3+, AlOH2+ being 20 \ndominant at pH >6; the principal bound form of Fe(III) is FeOH2+ at all pH values in the \nrange 4 - 9.  Simulations suggest that, in freshwaters, both Al and Fe(III) compete \nsignificantly with trace metals (Cu, Zn) for binding by natural organic matter over a wide pH \nrange (4 - 9).  The competition effects are especially strong for a high-affinity trace metal \nsuch as Cu, present at low total concentrations (~ 1 nM).

Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 3\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n \nAluminium and iron are abundant and reactive elements, with a variety of geochemical and \nenvironmental chemical roles.  In the dissolved and particulate phases of freshwaters, \nsediments and soils, they undergo significant interactions with natural organic matter (chiefly 5 \nhumic substances).  In the case of Al, it has been shown that interactions with organic matter \nare central to the chemistry of the element in organic-rich soils (e.g. Tipping et al., 1995; \nBerggren and Mulder, 1995; Skyllberg, 1999), and consequently to its transfer to surface \nwaters.  They also play a crucial role in determining Al toxicity (e.g. Driscoll et al., 1980).  \nDissolved iron-organic complexes and iron oxide-humic colloids are important in the 10 \ntransport and fate of the element in rivers and estuaries (Sholkovitz and Copland, 1981; Ross \nand Sherrell, 1999).  Adsorption of humic matter alters the surface chemistry and colloid \nstability of iron oxides (Tipping, 1986).  Photochemical processes involving Fe and natural \norganic matter lead to the decomposition of DOM, the production of reactive species \n(superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical), and the generation of dissolved, 15 \nbioavailable, ferrous iron (e.g. Collienne, 1983; Stumm and Morgan, 1996; Voelker et al., \n1997).   Iron and humic matter influence phosphorus speciation in lakes (Jones, et al., 1993).       \nWhereas the presence in freshwaters of dissolved complexes of (monomeric) Al with \nnatural organic matter is well established (Driscoll, 1984; LaZerte, 1984), the situation with \nregard to Fe(III) is less clear.  According to Perdue et al. (1976) and Koenings (1976), soluble 20 \niron-humic complexes are significant components of surface freshwaters.  Others (Shapiro, \n1966; Cameron and Liss, 1984) attribute the high apparent solubility of Fe in freshwaters to \nthe presence of small iron oxide particles stabilised by adsorbed humic matter.  Estimates of \nthe distribution of Fe(III) between the organically-complexed and colloidal oxide forms have \nbeen made by kinetic analysis, i.e. by determining the rate of conversion of Fe(III) to a 25 \nspectroscopically-detectable complex, following the addition of an excess of a suitable \nligand.  The starting species are then identified and quantified by fitting the kinetic data to a \nmodel in which each species has a rate constant in a defined range.  Tipping et al. (1982) \nfound that c. 30 % of the Fe(III) in the supernatant of a centrifuged lake water sample was \npresent as a fast-reacting component, possibly organically-complexed Fe.  Sojo and de Haan 30 \n(1991) reported that c. 60 % of the Fe(III) in a filtered (0.2 \u00b5m) neutral lake water (DOC 9 \nmg L-1) was present as organic complexes.  In both studies, Fe(III) not complexed by organic \nmatter was considered to be present as colloidal oxides.    \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 4\nThe interactions of Al and Fe with humic substances affect not only the two metals, \nbut also the organic matter itself.  Their binding may alter the tendency of humic substances \nto aggregate and to adsorb to surfaces (Ong and Bisque, 1968; Tipping et al., 1988b; Theng \nand Scharpenseel, 1975), and may affect the binding of other metals.  Thus, Al has been \nshown to compete with Eu (Susetyo et al., 1990; Bidoglio et al., 1991), Pb (Mota et al., 1996; 5 \nPinheiro et al., 2000) and Cd (Pinheiro et al., 2000), and competition by Fe(III) for Am and \nCu has been proposed (Peters et al, 2001).  In view of the high concentrations of Al and \nFe(III), compared to those of trace metals, such competition effects may be highly significant \nin natural systems.  Clearly therefore, a full understanding of metal chemistry in natural \nwaters needs to take into account the competitive reactions of Al, Fe and other metals with 10 \nhumic matter.   \nThe aim of the present work was to bring together existing and new information about \nAl and Fe binding by humic matter in freshwaters, and to examine how that binding will \naffect interactions with trace metals.  As a framework, we have used Humic Ion-Binding \nModel VI, a discrete-site, electrostatic, model of cation-humic interactions, which has been 15 \nparameterised with a large number of data sets from experiments with isolated humic \nsubstances (Tipping, 1998).   Model VI can be viewed as an encapsulation of available \nknowledge, and its application to natural systems as a comparison of laboratory-based \nexpectations with field reality.  An important assumption of the model is that all binding sites \nare available to all metals.  20 \nIn the following text, square brackets indicate concentrations.  Fulvic acid, humic acid \nand humic substances are abbreviated by FA, HA and HS respectively, dissolved organic \ncarbon and dissolved organic matter by DOC and DOM.  The variable \u03bd is moles of metal \nbound per gram of humic matter or DOM.  For simplicity, oxide phases are represented by \nAl(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3.  The term \u201cfilterable\u201d is used to indicate components that pass through 25 \na filter (typically with a pore size in the range 0.1 \u2013 1 \u00b5m), and which might be classed as \n\u201cdissolved\u201d for some practical purposes.  Such components will often include colloidal \nspecies, notably Fe(OH)3 and also Al(OH)3 and aluminosilicates. \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 5\n2.  SPECIATION MODELLING \n \n2.1  Humic Ion-Binding Model VI \nThe model was described in detail by Tipping (1998).  It uses a structured formulation of \ndiscrete, chemically-plausible, binding sites for protons, in order to allow the creation of regular 5 \narrays of bidentate and tridentate binding sites for metals.  Metal aquo ions (Ca2+, Fe3+, Cu2+ \netc.) and their first hydrolysis products (CaOH+, FeOH2+, CuOH+ etc.) compete with each \nother, and with protons, for binding.  The same intrinsic equilibrium constant is assumed to \napply to the aquo ion and its first hydrolysis product.  The intrinsic equilibrium constants are \nmodified by empirical electrostatic terms, that take into account the attractive or repulsive 10 \ninteractions between ions and the charged macromolecule.    \n The maximum number of parameters that can be optimised to describe metal binding is \nsix (KMA, KMB, \u2206LKA1, \u2206LKB1, \u2206LK2, Ksel).  In practice however, this number can be \nsubstantially reduced.  Thus, Tipping (1998) described the setting of a single universal value \nfor \u2206LKA1 and \u2206LKB1, and the estimation of \u2206LK2 by correlation with the equilibrium constant 15 \nfor complex formation with NH3.  For dilute systems, Ksel can be set to unity.  Finally, KMA and \nKMB are strongly correlated.  Therefore, the fitting of a new data set can be achieved by \nadjusting only KMA, which was the approach taken in the present work.  Table 1 shows the \nvalues of the Model VI parameters used in the present work.  It is important to note that the \nvalues of KMA in Table 1, for all the metals except Fe(III), have been derived by fitting 20 \nexperimental data; the values for Fe(III) are estimated from linear free energy relationships \n(Tipping, 1998).  High values of KMA mean that the metal is strongly bound at the high-\nabundance \u201cweak\u201d sites.  High values of \u2206LK2 mean that the metal is favoured by the low-\nabundance \u201cstrong\u201d sites, associated, according to the model, with nitrogen groups.  If \u2206LK2 is \nsmall, the strong sites are not favoured, and binding is predominantly due to binding at oxygen-25 \ncontaining sites. \n The humic binding model is combined with an inorganic speciation model, the \nspecies list and constants for which were given in the description of the Windermere Humic \nAqueous Model (WHAM; Tipping, 1994).  The inorganic reactions in this database are \nrestricted to monomeric complexes of metals.  The possible effect of the formation of the 30 \ndimeric species Al2(OH)24+, considered important by Sutheimer and Cabaniss (1997), was \nexamined, for field samples, by using the formation constant given by these authors (Section \n4.4); it was assumed that the dimer did not bind to humic matter.  Ionic strength effects on the \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 6\ninorganic reactions are taken into account using the extended Debye-H\u00fcckel equation.  \nTemperature effects on reactions between inorganic species are taken into account using \npublished or estimated enthalpy data, but in the absence of experimental information, \nreactions involving humic substances are assumed to be independent of temperature.  The \ncombined model used in the present work is referred to as WHAM \/ Model VI.    5 \n \n2.2  Solubilities of aluminium and iron (hydr)oxides  \nFor some simulations presented in this paper, it is assumed that solution activities of Al3+ and \nFe3+ are controlled by the solubilities of Al(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3, according to the reactions \nO3HAl3HAl(OH) 233 +=+ ++        (1) 10 \n  O3HFe3HFe(OH) 233 +=+ ++     (2) \nFrom measurements on field samples (Johnson et al., 1981; Tipping et al., 1988a; LaZerte, \n1989), the assumption of a simple solubility control of Al is reasonable for acidic waters low \nin [DOC], and neutral waters.  Solubility products (aAl3+\/aH+3) at 25oC (Kso,25) for such waters \nare in the range 108 to 109.  However most acidic freshwaters high in [DOC] are 15 \nundersaturated with respect to known forms of Al(OH)3, and therefore the use of a solubility \ncontrol under these circumstances will lead to overestimation of dissolved inorganic Al \nconcentrations, and thereby to overestimation of Al binding to humic matter (cf. Sections 4.6 \nand 4.7).  Reported enthalpy changes for reaction (1) are in the range  -88 to -125 kJ mol-1 \n(Couturier et al., 1984; Tipping et al., 1988a; Nordstrom et al., 1990), and a mid-range value 20 \nof  -107 kJ mol-1 is adopted here. \nReported solubility products (aFe3+\/aH+3) at 25oC for \u201camorphous iron oxide\u201d, \n\u201chydrous ferric oxide\u201d, ferrihydrite etc, formed in the laboratory, are in the range 102.5 \u2013 105.  \nThe lowest value was given by Baes and Mesmer (1976), while the range 103 \u2013 105 was \nproposed by Nordstrom et al. (1990).  Lower values represent aged materials, while the 25 \nhigher ones are more typical for freshly precipitated material.  It can be envisaged that natural \nwaters and soils contain phases with a range of solubility products, depending for example on \nthe intensity of redox cycling or photochemical effects.  The enthalpy change for reaction (2) \nis taken to be \u2013102 kJ mol-1, based on data published by Liu and Millero (1999).   \n30 \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 7\n3.  EXPERIMENTAL \n \n3.1  Isolation of humic acid   \nThe procedure followed that of Swift (1996).  One kilogram of peat was collected from a site \nin the Pennines (N. England), sieved, mixed with 1 litre of 0.1 M HCl and stirred overnight.  5 \nThe resulting suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 4400g, and the supernatant discarded.  \nThe pellet was mixed with 2 litres of 0.15 M NaOH and stirred overnight under an \natmosphere of N2 in the dark.  The basic soil suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant \nremoved and acidified to pH~1 with 6 M HCl.  The acid solution was stirred overnight, then \ncentrifuged.  The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet redissolved in 2.7 litres of 0.1 M 10 \nKOH under N2 in the dark.  Then KCl was added to give a final K+ concentration of approx. \n0.3 M.  The solution was centrifuged, the pellet discarded, and the humic acid re-precipitated \nwith acid at pH 1.  After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant, the solid was \ntransferred to a 5 litre plastic beaker and stirred overnight with 2 litres of 0.1 M HCl \/ 0.3 M \nHF.  The suspension was neutralised with 5 % (w\/v) H3BO3 (AnalaR), and the resulting 15 \nsolution centrifuged.  This process was repeated twice more.  The humic acid product was \nslurried with water, placed in dialysis bags (Visking tubing size 9, MWCO 12000-14000, \ncleaned with hot NaHCO3 and thoroughly rinsed with water), and dialysed against 0.1 M \nHNO3 in the dark at 10oC, the outside solution being changed daily for 13 days.  The final \nyield of humic acid was 34 g.  Its ash content was 0.6%, and it contained 10.8 \u00b5mol Fe g-1, as 20 \ndetermined by microwave digestion with conc. HNO3 and measurement of iron with \nbathophrenanthroline after reduction with NH2OH.  This material is referred to as HA-1.  The \niron content of the humic acid was diminished by repeated washing with 3 M HCl (Hering \nand Morel, 1988), to give a sample (HA-2) containing 3.8 \u00b5mol Fe g-1.  The extractable Al \ncontents of HA-1 and HA-2 were both very low (0.09 \u00b5mol g-1). 25 \n \n3.2  Preparation of HA samples with different Fe contents \nTwo 70 cm3 portions of HA-1 suspension (~23 g L-1) in 0.1M HNO3 were taken and mixed, \nwhile stirring thoroughly, with different amounts of a solution of 0.01M Fe(NO3)3 \/ 0.1M \nHNO3.  The mixtures were then placed in separate dialysis bags, and dialysed against 4-litre 30 \nvolumes of 0.1M NaNO3 \/ 10-4 M HNO3 (pH ~ 4) in the dark at 10oC, with five changes of \nthe outside-bag solution.  Because the dialysis procedure brought about a gradual increase in \npH from 1 to 4, the precipitation of ferric oxide colloids, which might have occurred if the \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 8\niron salt was added immediately at pH 4, was assumed to have been avoided; the final ion \nactivity products (aFe3+\/aH+3) were all appreciably lower than the solubility products of \nFe(OH)3 (see section 2.2).  The final preparations are referred to as HA-3 (14.4 \u00b5mol Fe g-1) \nand HA-4 (35.9 \u00b5mol Fe g-1).  We used HA in this work firstly because it could readily be \nobtained in the large quantities required for the Cu titration experiments (see below), and 5 \nsecondly because it is of sufficiently large molecular size to be retained by a dialysis \nmembrane that could still allowing relatively rapid passage of inorganic solutes, necessary to \nload the material with Fe. \n  \n3.3  Copper titration experiments 10 \nMeasurements of pH were made with a Radiometer model GK2401C combination electrode \nconnected to a Radiometer PHM.  The electrode was calibrated with phthalate and phosphate \nBDH buffers, following procedures recommended by Davison (1990).  Measurements of \nCu2+ were made with an Orion cupric half-cell model 9429 ion-selective electrode, and an \nOrion Ag \/ AgCl double-junction model 90-02 reference electrode, attached to an Orion 15 \nMicroprocessor Ionanalyzer 901.  The Cu electrode was prepared according to Avdeef et al. \n(1983).  Each day, before calibration and titration, the electrode was polished carefully with \nOrion aluminium oxide (3\u00b5) polishing strip (moistened in MilliQ water), rinsed carefully \nwith MilliQ water, soaked in 0.025 M H2SO4 for approx. 10 minutes, then rinsed with more \nMilliQ water.  The outer solution of the reference electrode was replaced daily, and the inner 20 \nsolution weekly.  Before each experiment, the electrode was calibrated at 20oC over a range \nof 10-6 to 10-3 M in [Cu2+].  A calibration check was performed after each experiment.  \nCalibration slopes were always within 1 % of the Nernstian value.  All titrations were \nperformed with the apparatus covered to exclude light.  According to the manufacturer \n(Orion), Fe(III) interferes when the concentration of Fe3+ is greater than one-tenth of the Cu2+ 25 \nconcentration; we calculate that in our experiments the maximum ratio of Fe3+ to Cu2+ was \n0.003, which implies negligible interference. \nTo prepare the humic acid for titration, a dialysed suspension (HA-2, HA-3 or HA-4) \nwas diluted with 0.1 M NaNO3 \/ 10-4 M HNO3 to give [HA] = 1 g L-1.  An aliquot of 100 \ncm3 was taken, and bubbled at room temperature for approx. 1 h with wet air, enriched to 0.1  30 \n% with CO2. [Note that for the experiments described here, the use of CO2-enriched air was \nnot necessary, but the experiments followed the protocol of other experiments at higher pH, \nwhere control of pCO2 was required.]  It was then transferred to a thermostatted jacket at \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 9\n20oC, the electrodes were inserted, Cu(NO3)2 was added to give an initial total Cu \nconcentration of 10-6 M, and the system was left to equilibrate for one hour, still bubbled with \nair.  The first EMF reading was then taken, and the titration was performed by adding further \nknown amounts of Cu(NO3)2.  At each addition, the EMF reading was accepted when the \nelectrode drift became less than 0.1 mV min-1. 5 \n \n3.4  Analysis of field samples \nFifteen litres of each surface water sample were collected in acid-washed polyethylene \ncontainers taking care not to disturb any sediment.  Powder-less gloves were worn throughout \nthe sampling procedure, and containers were rinsed with some sample water prior to 10 \ncollection.  Samples were transported to the laboratory immediately after collection, and were \nfiltered (Whatman, GF\/F) before storage in the dark at 4\u00baC for up to one week (pH and Fe \ndeterminations were made within 3 days).  Monomeric Al was determined by the method of \nSeip et al. (1984).  The samples were analysed for pH (glass electrode), DOC (Dohrmann \nanalyser; combustion to CO2) and alkalinity (Gran titration).  A Perkin-Elmer 2380 atomic 15 \nabsorption spectrophotometer was used to analyse the filtered samples for major cations \n(Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+).  Major anions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-) were determined by ion \nchromatography (Dionex 2000i \/ SP).  The method for determining ferrous and ferric iron \nconcentrations was based on the formation of a coloured complex between ferrous iron and \nbathophenanthroline in acetate buffer (Smith et al., 1952).  Total filterable iron was 20 \ndetermined following overnight reduction with hydroxylammonium chloride, and Fe(II) by \nmeasurement without reduction.  Colour was allowed to develop for 1-2 minutes following \naddition of the colorimetric reagent; this period is sufficiently short that little conversion of \nFe(III) to Fe(II) would have taken place, in the absence of the reducing agent (Box,1984).  \nThe Fe(III) concentration, required for modelling (Section 4.5), was calculated as the 25 \ndifference between the total iron (reduced solutions), and the ferrous iron (not reduced).  In \nthe samples studied, the Fe was mainly in the Fe(III) form, the average proportion being 70% \n(range 50-93%).  We assume that the filterable Fe(III) determined in this way comprises \norganically complexed metal, together with readily reducible (amorphous) iron hydroxide \ncolloids. 30 \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 10\n4.  RESULTS \n \n4.1  Laboratory data for Al(III) \nThe application of Model VI to some laboratory data for Al-humic interaction has been \ndescribed already (Tipping, 1998).  Additional data have subsequently been published by 5 \nKinniburgh et al. (1999) for \u201cpurified peat humic acid\u201d (PPHA).  Model VI was applied by \nfixing all the default values (Table 1), except that the value of KMA for Al was optimised by \nleast-squares minimisation (Fig. 1).  The fitting is successful in that the model provides the \ncorrect pH dependence, and the optimised log KMA of 2.5 is close to the initial default of 2.6 \n(Table 1).  However, the fit is not as precise as was achieved by the NICCA-Donnan model, 10 \nusing two adjustable parameters (Kinniburgh et al., 1999). \n Tipping (1998) and Lead et al. (1998) showed that Model VI can account for the \ncompetitive effects of Al on Eu binding to FA, and on Pb binding by HA.  Additional data on \nthe Al-Pb-PPHA and Al-Cd-PPHA systems have since been published by Pinheiro et al. \n(2000), as shown in Fig. 2.  WHAM\/Model VI was applied by adjusting KMA to fit the data 15 \nobtained in the absence of Al.  For Pb, the best value of log KMA for Pb was 2.1, close to the \nvalue of 2.15 obtained from earlier data for PPHA but at an ionic strength of 0.02 M \n(Pinheiro et al., 1994).  For the Cd data, the best value of log KMA for Cd was 1.5, quite close \nto the value of 1.3 found for data for PPHA at higher ionic strengths (Pinheiro et al., 1994; \nBenedetti et al., 1995).  Using these optimised values of KMA for Pb and Cd, together with the 20 \nKMA for Al (see above), reasonable predictions of competition effects are obtained (Fig 2).  \nThe results provide further support for the model\u2019s basic assumption that the metals in \nquestion share common binding sites in humic substances.  Independent evidence that metals \nshare common sites also comes from fluorescence spectroscopic studies (Cabaniss, 1992), \ndemonstrating competition by Al for Cu binding by fulvic acid. 25 \n \n4.2 Laboratory data for Fe(III) \nThere are few experimental data for Fe(III) binding by humic substances.  Langford and \nKhan (1975) studied Fe(III) binding by FA in the pH range 1-2.5, using a stopped-flow \nkinetic method, and were able to derive equilibrium binding data.  They obtained values of \u03bd 30 \nin the range 7x10-5 to 1.4x10-3 mol g-1; at these relatively high values, the weaker, abundant, \nsites identified by the model would be dominant in the binding of Fe.  The model was applied \nby fixing all the default values (Table 1), except for KMA, which was adjusted to obtain the \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 11\nbest fit.  Only the data for pH 2.5 were used for fitting (Fig. 3), because at lower pH values \nthe amount of binding was very small; even at pH 2.5 the maximum amount bound was only \n20 % of the total Fe(III), which probably explains the noise in the data.  Some data at high \ntotal Fe concentrations were also rejected because the model calculations suggested that the \nsolubility product of Fe(OH)3 might have been exceeded.  The optimised value of log KMA 5 \nwas 2.8, which is somewhat greater than the default value of 2.4 shown in Table 1.   \nLiu and Millero (1999) carried out experiments in which iron oxide containing the \nradioactive isotope 59Fe was equilibrated with solutions of different pH, with and without 0.6 \nmg l-1 HA, in 0.7 M NaCl.  One set of data refers to constant [HA] and varied pH, the other to \nconstant pH and varied [HA].  Concentrations of Fe(III) (either purely inorganic forms, or 10 \ninorganic forms plus HA-Fe complexes) that would pass though a 0.02 \u00b5m filter were \ndetermined, by measurement of radioactivity.  It was assumed by Liu and Millero, and is \nassumed here, that all such Fe(III) is actually truly dissolved, i.e. none is present as small \ncolloidal particles.  The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4, together with Model VI fits.  \nThe model was applied by calculating concentrations of inorganic Fe(III) species in the 15 \nfiltrates containing HA, i.e. by calculating the distribution of Fe between inorganic and \norganic forms.  The calculated total inorganic Fe(III) concentrations were compared with the \nmeasured values from separate experiments in which HA was absent; these concentrations \nare assumed to be the same in the presence or absence of HA  The value of KMA was adjusted \nto minimise the sum of squared differences between the observed and calculated inorganic Fe 20 \nconcentrations.  The best fit for the data at constant HA concentration was obtained with log \nKMA = 2.4.  For the constant pH set, the optimised value was 2.3.  The model therefore \nprovides a good description of the experimental data, with optimised log KMA values slightly \nlower than the default value of 2.5 (Table 1). \nFig. 5 shows the effect of Fe(III) on the binding of Cu by humic acid at pH 4, 25 \ndetermined in the present study.  The ranges of \u03bd and [Cu2+] cover substantial ranges, and \nespecially the range of low-occupancy binding where the \"strong\" sites are dominant. A \nsignificant competitive effect by Fe(III) is observed.  The model was applied by finding the \nvalues of KMA for Cu and Fe(III) that gave the smallest sum of squared residuals in log \n[Cu2+].  The optimal log KMA for Cu was 1.82, which is close to the default of 2.0.  The 30 \noptimal log KMA for Fe(III) was 2.6.   The ion activity products (aFe3+\/aH+3) are calculated to \nbe no greater than 101.7 for any of the solutions, so it can be assumed that there was no \nprecipitation of Fe(OH)3.  The good simulation of the Fe-Cu competition experiments \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 12\nprovides further support for the basic model assumption that the metals share sites in humic \nmatter.  \n \n4.3  Revised default values of KMA for Al and Fe(III) \nThe fitting exercises described above provide additional values of log KMA for both Al and 5 \nFe(III), and these can be used to revise the default values.  For Al, combining previous and \nnew estimates yields a log KMA for HA of 2.6 (n = 3, standard deviation = 0.2), while the \nvalue for FA is unchanged at 2.5 (n = 2, sd = 0.1).  For Fe(III), we obtain values of 2.4 (n = 2, \nsd = 0.1) for HA and 2.6 (n = 2, sd = 0.2) for FA.   The revised defaults are used in all \nsubsequent calculations in this paper, except where KMA is adjusted in order to perform data 10 \nfitting.  \n \n4.4  Al speciation in freshwater samples  \nTipping et al. (1991) assembled field data on Al speciation from 12 locations in Europe and \nNorth America, a total of 108 samples.  The data covered wide ranges of pH (3.9-7.3), 15 \n[Al]total (0.1 \u2013 26 \u00b5M) and [DOC] (0.3 \u2013 28 mg L-1).  They were reanalysed in the present \nwork, together with eight additional data points taken from Sutheimer and Cabaniss (1997).  \nThe model was applied in three ways.  First, it was assumed that all DOC in the samples had \nthe ion-binding properties of isolated HS, with default parameters.  Second, default \nparameters were used, and the fraction of DOC due to HS was adjusted to achieve the best 20 \nagreement between measured and calculated concentrations of organically-bound Al, [Alorg], \nby minimising the root mean squared difference.  Third, all the DOC was ascribed to HS, and \nthe KMA value for Al was adjusted to achieve the best agreement, while maintaining all other \nmodel parameters at their default values.  The calculations were performed assuming (a) all \nthe HS to be FA and (b) the HS to be 80% FA and 20% HA, and two solubility products for 25 \nFe(OH)3 were assumed.  The results are shown in Table 2. \n The fact that versions of the model, calibrated as described above, can explain \na considerable amount (r2 ~ 0.75) of the variation in [Alorg] suggests that the DOM in the field \nsamples behaves similarly to isolated humic matter in terms of ion binding.  The \noptimisations improve the agreement between observed and calculated values, and this is 30 \nachieved either by decreasing the amount of material available to bind the metal, or by \nweakening the binding affinity.  The better agreements obtained without optimisation when \nlog Kso,25 for Fe(OH)3 is increased from 2.5 to 4.0 occur because this effectively decreases the \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 13\naffinity of the organic matter towards Al.  The results in Table 2 also show that including the \ndimerisation reaction, to form Al2(OH)24+, has relatively little effect on the calculation of \norganic complexation of Al. \nThe conclusion that natural water DOM as a whole binds metals either less \nextensively or less strongly than isolated humic matter has been drawn previously from Cu 5 \nbinding studies (Cabaniss and Shuman, 1988; Dwane and Tipping, 1998), and from \napplication of a forerunner of WHAM\/Model VI to the present Al data set and to ionic charge \nbalance data (Tipping et al., 1991).  Possible explanations are (1) the DOM consists partly of \n\u201cactive\u201d humic matter and partly of material that is inert with respect to ion binding; (2) \nisolated HS are to some extent unrepresentative of natural DOM, perhaps because of 10 \nalterations during isolation; (3) the model description of competition reactions is inadequate.  \nIt is not possible, on the basis of the present results, to make a definitive judgement.  \nHowever, it can be noted that, with regard to goodness-of-fit, Tipping et al. (1991) showed \nthat most, if not all, of the RMSDs could be due to analytical uncertainties in model input \ndata, and in measured values of [Alorg], which implies that model improvements would not 15 \nlead to better fits.  The adjustment of KMA for Al, while maintaining all other parameters at \ntheir default values, is somewhat unsatisfactory, since it means abandoning the inter-\nparameter relationships established from analysis of experimental data for isolated HS.  \nFurthermore, it is known that DOC does not consist entirely of humic matter (Thurman, \n1985).  For these reasons, it seems preferable to calibrate the model by adjusting the fraction 20 \nof DOC that consists of \u201cactive\u201d HS.  This approach leads to \u201cactive\u201d HS fractions between \n61 and 70% of DOC, depending upon assumptions about the FA:HA ratio and the value of \nlog Kso,25 for Fe(OH)3.  These fractions easily represent the majority of the organic matter.  \nResults for one of the cases are plotted in Fig. 6. \n  25 \n4.5  Fe(III) binding by DOM in freshwater samples \nTipping et al. (1982) carried out kinetic analysis (see Introduction) on a centrifuged surface \nwater sample from Esthwaite Water, a soft water lake of pH 7.1.  They estimated that 30% of \nthe Fe(III) (total concentration 0.40 \u00b5M) in a filtered sample was in a form that reacted at a \nrate compatible with that of Fe-organic complexes, while the other 70% was attributed to iron 30 \noxides.  The concentration of dissolved HS was 2.0 mg l-1.  Therefore \u03bdFe = 6.0\u00d710-5 mol g-1.  \nApplications of WHAM \/ Model VI to this water sample, assuming all the HS to be FA, are \nsummarised in Table 3.  With default values of log KMA for Al and Fe, and log Kso,25 set to \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 14\n8.0 and 4.0 for Al(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3 respectively, the calculated value of \u03bdFe is quite close to \nthe observed value, and exact agreement can be obtained by slightly increasing log KMA for \nFe to 2.62.  If a higher solubility product is assumed for Al(OH)3, a correspondingly higher \nvalue of log KMA for Fe (2.72) is required to achieve the same degree of fit. \nThe same approach was applied to a filtered (0.2 \u00b5m) sample of Tjeukemeer, a hard 5 \nwater lake.  Sojo and De Haan (1991) reported that 60% of the 2.1 \u00b5M Fe(III) in a filtered \nsample of the lake water (pH 6.4) was complexed by organic matter.  The computed value of \n\u03bdFe is 1.1\u00d710-4 mol g-1 if it is assumed that 65% of the DOC is due to FA (cf. Section 4.4).  \nThe model constants required to match the Tjeukemeer observations are similar to those for \nEsthwaite Water (Table 3). 10 \n The results from the two samples studied provide similar model \u201cfits\u201d.  The exercise \nillustrates the degree of uncertainty that exists with respect to modelling Fe(III) complexation \nby dissolved organic matter.  However, the required parameter values are within the ranges \nthat can be deemed allowable, based on available information.  Very similar results were \nobtained if the humic matter was assumed to consist of 80% FA and 20% HA. 15 \nTo attempt to gain further insight into Fe(III) speciation in natural waters, we applied \nWHAM \/ Model VI to field data collected for UK freshwaters, in which the concentration of \nfilterable Fe(III) was determined (Section 3.4).  This filterable Fe(III) is taken to comprise \ntruly dissolved Fe(III), present almost entirely as organic complexes, together with colloidal \nFe(OH)3.  Monomeric Al was also determined, and as this can reasonably be assumed to be a 20 \nmeasure of the concentration of truly dissolved metal, assumptions about Al(OH)3 solubility \nare unnecessary.  The activity of Fe3+ was assumed to be controlled by the equilibrium with \nFe(OH)3 (log Kso,25 = 2.5 or 4.0).  The \u201cactive\u201d organic binding component was assumed to \nbe FA, concentrations of which were estimated from [DOC] using the percentages given in \nsection 4.4.  The results of the calculations (Table 4) suggest that the fraction of organically-25 \ncomplexed Fe(III) tends to decrease with pH, from values near to 1.0 at pH ~ 4 to 0.1 or less \nat pH ~ 7.  According to the solubility control model, values greater than 1.0 are impossible, \nsince they mean that the calculated concentration of organically-complexed Fe(III) exceeds \nthe total measured concentration.  In the few cases (one for log Kso,25 = 2.5, three for log Kso,25 \n= 4.0) where the fraction is equal to or greater than 1.0, solubility control by Fe(OH)3 may 30 \ntherefore not be operating.  The calculated values of \u03bdFe in Table 4 are generally lower than \nthose estimated by kinetic analysis (see above).  This reflects the relatively high activities of \nAl3+, corresponding to log Kso,25 ~ 9, calculated for the samples of Table 4, and the use of the \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 15\ndefault log KMA for Fe, rather than the slightly higher values needed to obtain agreement with \nthe field speciation results (Table 3).  The overall conclusion from this analysis is that \nfilterable Fe(III) in natural waters is due to both colloidal Fe(OH)3 and truly-dissolved \ncomplexes with humic matter, the dominant form depending upon solution conditions, \nnotably pH and [DOC]. 5 \n \n4.6  Simulated binding of Al and Fe by DOM in natural waters \nIn the previous two sections, model calculations were compared with field observations.  \nHere, the intention is to simulate Al and Fe binding by DOM over solution conditions \nrepresenting a range of freshwaters.  Calculations were performed to simulate the titration 10 \nwith Ca(OH)2 of initially acid solutions, containing 10 mg L-1 FA to represent freshwater \ndissolved organic matter, and in equilibrium with Al(OH)3 and\/or Fe(OH)3.  All the solutions \nwere at a partial pressure of CO2 of 0.0007 atm.  The additions of Ca(OH)2 took the total Ca \nconcentration to 0.003 M. \n The upper panels in Fig. 7 show the distributions of dissolved Al and Fe between 15 \ninorganic and organic forms.  For the chosen values of Kso,25, organically-bound Al in the \nabsence of Fe is present at somewhat higher concentrations than organically-bound Fe in the \nabsence of Al.  When both metals are present together, Fe has little effect on Al binding by \norganic matter, whereas Al substantially decreases the binding of Fe.  Inorganic \nconcentrations of Al exceed organic concentrations at low and high pH, whereas dissolved Fe 20 \nis mainly in the organic form over the whole pH range considered.  It should be noted that in \nmany acid natural waters, Al is appreciably undersaturated with respect to Al(OH)3 (see \nSection 2.2), and so the inorganic and organic concentrations of Al at low pH, shown in Fig. \n7, are likely to be too high.  For the same reason, the competitive effect of Al towards Fe \nbinding at low pH will tend to be overestimated.  The bottom left-hand panel of Fig. 7 shows 25 \nhow \u03bdFe depends upon the assumed Kso,25 value, on Al competition, and on pH.  With log \nKso,25 values of 8.5 and 4.0 for Al(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3 respectively, the total binding of Al and \nFe(III) by FA is c. 10-3 mol g-1 at pH 5, and 2x10-4 mol g-1 at pH 7.  Thus the two metals \noccupy c. 30% and 5% of the total proton binding sites at the respective pH values. \n Model VI assumes that humic matter can bind the free metal cations (Al3+ and Fe3+) 30 \nand also, with the same value of KMA, their first hydrolysis products (AlOH2+ and FeOH2+).  \nThe bottom right-hand panel of Fig. 7 shows how binding of the two possible species of each \nmetal varies with pH.  For Al, the trivalent cation is the dominant form bound up to pH ~6, \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 16\nwith AlOH2+ becoming dominant at higher pH.  For Fe, FeOH2+ is the principal form of Fe \nbound under all pH values considered.  The differences reflect the greater tendency of  Fe(III) \nto hydrolyse. \n Similar results to those shown here for solutions containing only FA as the humic \ncomponent were found for solutions containing 80% FA and 20% HA.  5 \n \n4.7  Simulated effects of Al and Fe on the binding of trace metals to freshwater DOM  \nTo explore the implications of Al and Fe binding for trace metal speciation in natural waters, \nWHAM \/ Model VI was used to simulate titrations with base at constant trace metal \nconcentrations, and with metals at constant pH.  Figs. 8 and 9 show calculations for titrations 10 \nof initially acid solutions containing 10 mg l-1 FA, and either 1 \u00b5M or 1 nM Cu or Zn.  All the \nsolutions were at a partial pressure of CO2 of 0.0007 atm.  The titrations were as follows:  A, \nadditions of NaOH; B, additions of Ca(OH)2; C, additions of Ca(OH)2, solution in \nequilibrium with Al(OH)3 (log Kso,25 = 8.5); D, additions of Ca(OH)2, solution in equilibrium \nwith Fe(OH)3 (log Kso,25 = 4.0); E, additions of Ca(OH)2, solution in equilibrium with 15 \nAl(OH)3 and Fe(OH)3.  The point about the undersaturation of acid waters with respect to \nAl(OH)3 (Section 4.6) applies here also; the simulated competitive effects of Al at low pH \nshould be regarded as maximal. \nAt a total Cu concentration of 1 \u00b5M (Fig. 8, left-hand panels), binding by FA is \nmaximal in titration A, and Ca exerts a competitive effect, in the absence of Al and Fe 20 \n(titration B). Competition by Al further decreases Cu binding (titration C), to a greater extent \nthan does Fe (titration D).  When Al and Fe are both present (titration E), the binding curves \nare similar to the Al-only case.  The effects of Al and Fe are reversed when the total Cu \nconcentration is set to 1 nM (Fig. 8 right-hand panels).  For titrations D and E at 1 nM Cu, the \ncompetitive effects are such that, [Cu2+] is c. 5 - 6 orders of magnitude greater than in the 25 \nNaOH titration. \n Zinc binding by FA is much weaker than Cu binding, and at total Zn concentrations of \nboth 1 \u00b5M and 1 nM, Ca is an effective competitor (Fig. 9).  Aluminium and Fe decrease \nbinding further, more so at 1 nM than 1 \u00b5M.  Because of the weak binding of Zn, competition \neffects are more evident in % metal bound,  than the concentration of the free metal ion.   30 \n The results of calculations to simulate metal titrations at a constant pH of 7 are shown \nin Fig. 10.  The binding isotherm for Cu is modestly affected by Ca, but strongly altered by \nAl and Fe, which drastically reduce the influence of the low-abundance high-affinity humic \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 17\nbinding sites.  As expected from the plots of Fig. 9, the isotherm for Zn (Fig. 10) is strongly \naffected by Ca, while Al and Fe add further modest competitive effects. \n The above results refer to solutions in which the freshwater DOC that is active in \nmetal binding is represented by isolated FA.  Very similar patterns were obtained if the DOC \nwas represented by a mixture of 80% FA and 20% HA. 5 \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 18\n5.  DISCUSSION \n \nAluminium and iron have complex chemistries, and their binding reactions with humic \nsubstances have been subjected to relatively little experimental investigation.  Humic \nsubstances themselves are complex and possibly variable with respect to source.  5 \nConsequently, our ability to predict equilibrium humic binding of Al and Fe in natural waters \nis imprecise.   Nonetheless, the modelling results presented here, together with earlier \nfindings,  indicate a reasonably coherent picture of the interactions of the individual metals \nwith humic matter, and of some competitive interactions involving trace metals (Cu, Cd, Eu, \nPb).  Thus, Model VI can account for the available information if some tolerance among 10 \nexamples is allowed in the values of the key parameter KMA.  The model can account \napproximately for field data on Al speciation, following calibration of the \u201cactivity\u201d of DOM \nin terms of its HS content.  The very limited field data for Fe(III) complexation by DOM do \nnot permit a full calibration, but given reasonable assumptions, the model can be made to \nreproduce the observed values.  15 \n If it is accepted that the model has approximate validity, then the predictive \ncalculations raise interesting issues in freshwater metal chemistry.  Firstly, it is evident that \ncompetition effects among metals can be highly significant in freshwaters.  According to the \ncalculations performed here, Al affects Fe(III) more than the reverse, but it would be \npremature to assume this always to be the case.  Secondly, binding of Al and Fe by humic 20 \nmatter is expected to have strong effects on the binding of trace metals, exemplified in the \npresent study by Cu and Zn.  For the freshwater conditions considered here, the competition \neffects are greater for the metal (Cu) with the higher affinity for humic matter (Figs. 8 and \n10).  Indeed, the isotherms of Fig. 10 suggest that the low-abundance, high-affinity sites that \nhave been demonstrated in isolated and purified humic matter (see e.g. Benedetti et al., 1995; 25 \nKinniburgh et al., 1996) may be far less important under conditions prevailing in natural \nfreshwaters.  This being so, it is difficult to attribute the strong binding of metals such as Cu \nin some freshwaters (e.g. Xue and Sigg, 1993) to humic matter and related complexants, as \nTown and Filella (2000) recently have done.  The alternative explanation, proposed by Xue \nand Sigg, is that the strong binding is by highly selective ligands, released by phytoplankton 30 \nin order to control metal levels in their immediate environment.  Similar conclusions have \nbeen drawn for the surface oceans (Bruland et al., 1991).  Our findings are compatible with \nthe existence of the selective biogenic ligands.   \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.    Al(III) and Fe(III) binding by humic substances in freshwaters \/ REVISION 19\nThis study has focused on solution interactions in systems assumed to be at  \nequilibrium.  In real natural waters, there are a number of additional factors.  With regard to \nFe(III) in particular, the equilibrium assumption can certainly be questioned, because of  \nbiologically- or photochemically-mediated redox cycling.  In addition, the ageing of iron \nhydroxide colloids may lead to variations in their solubility product (cf. Section 2.2).  5 \nTherefore, the equilibrium description of binding by humic substances and hydroxide \nprecipitation is accurate only if these reactions take place rapidly compared to the redox and \nageing processes.  With the same assumption, the present approach could deal with systems \ncontaining both Fe(II) and Fe(III).  With regard to trace metal speciation, biogenic selective \nligands have already been mentioned.  In addition, binding by both colloidal and coarser 10 \nparticulate mineral surfaces may be significant in natural systems, and humic matter \nassociated with colloids and particles may also be important.  In principle, such interactions \ncould be added to the present equilibrium analysis, using for example SCAMP (Lofts and \nTipping, 1998) or CD-MUSIC (Weng et al., 2001).  These additional factors would need to \nbe taken into account in order to obtain a full understanding of natural waters.  Despite the 15 \nsimplifying approach, the work described here sets the role of humic binding in context, and \ncontributes to a clarification of the theoretical basis of describing these complex systems.  \n A number of issues merit further investigation.  Information about the binding of Al \nand, especially, Fe(III) by isolated humic substances \u2013 especially aquatic samples - remains \nsparse, and competition studies for solution conditions representative of natural waters are 20 \nmuch needed.  Future work should pay close attention to the Al and Fe(III) contents of the \nhumic samples.  With regard to measurements on natural waters, analytical capabilities for Al \nare reasonably good, since reliable speciation methods are available for dissolved forms of \nthe metal (Driscoll, 1984; Seip et al., 1984; Clarke and Danielsson, 1995; Sutheimer and \nCabaniss, 1995).  There are several promising techniques for determining dissolved Fe(III) 25 \nspeciation, including complexation by humic substances.  The kinetic approach was \nmentioned in Section 4.5.  Other possibilities are the flow-injection technique of Pullin and \nCabaniss (2001), the extraction method of Clarke and Danielsson (1995), and filtration \nmethodology (e.g. Ross and Sherrell, 1999).  An important next step is to apply some or all of \nthese to natural waters, and to compare the results with model predictions, including 30 \ncompetition effects.   \nAlthough the work described here has focused on metal binding to humic matter in \nfreshwaters, the principles must apply to other environmental situations.  Thus, competition \nby Al and Fe may be important for organic matter in seawater, soils and sediments, and also \n21\/01\/08 E.Tipping et al.
