CLARE WENGER*, RICHARD DAVIESj,\nSAID SHAHTAHMASEBI+ and ANNE SCOTT*\nABSTRACT\nThis paper reviews the empirical literature on social isolation\nand loneliness and identifies a wide range of published\ncorrelates. Using data from a study conducted in North Wales,\nwhich included many of the same correlated variables, a\nstatistical modelling technique is used to refine models of\nisolation and loneliness by controlling for co-variance. The\nresulting models indicate that the critical factors for isolation\nare: marital status, network type and social class; and, for\nloneliness: network type, household composition and health.\nKEY WORDS - Isolation, loneliness, model, networks.\nBackground\nSocial isolation and loneliness have long been identified as problems\nassociated with old age (Sheldon 1948; Halmos 1952). Although not\nalways made explicit in the literature, social isolation refers to the\nobjective state of having minimal contact with other people; while\nloneliness refers to the subjective state of negative feelings associated\nwith perceived social isolation, a lower level of contact than that\ndesired or the absence of a specific desired companion. As populations\nage these problems are increasingly viewed as a major concern (Bennett\n* Centre for Social Policy Research and Development, University of Wales, Bangor,\nGwynedd LL57 2DG, U.K.\nt Centre for Applied Statistics, Lancaster University.\nJ Northern and Yorkshire Regional Health Authority.\n334 G- Clare Wenger et al.\n1980; Mullins et al. 1988; Christ and Muller 1991) and absence of\nloneliness and isolation is seen as important for a good quality of life\n(Sinclair et al. 1990). In the context of social policy and service\nprovision for elderly people the fact that biological reactions to stress\nmay increase physical susceptibility to disease and mental illness (Dean\nand Lin 1977) indicates that amelioration of these stressful conditions\ncan improve health as well as quality of life.\nThe importance of social isolation in social policy terms is implicit in\nthe emphasis placed on social integration and support networks in the\nGriffiths Report (1988) and the Government White Paper (DoH\n1989), with the associated guidance (DoH 1990a and b) and in its\ncorrelation with institutional admissions (Rodstein et al. 1976; Ross\nand Kedward 1976) and poor rehabilitation (Hyman 1972).\nLoneliness has been described as the main problem associated with\nold age (Wilkes 1978). It has been identified as a common presenting\nproblem in referrals to social services (Stevenage Development\nCorporation 1973; Hazan 1980; Grant 1981; Sinclair et al. 1990;\nJerrome 1991) and a significant correlate with entry to residential care\n(Townsend 1965; Wenger 1984a; Sinclair et al. 1990).\nSocial isolation and loneliness have been identified as susceptible to\ntherapeutic interventions (Bennet 1980; Freeman 1988; Grant 1988;\nMullins et al. 1988; Knipscheer 1988; Jerrome 1991, 1992) and thus as\nimportant targets for preventive strategies (Goldberg 1979; Hadley et\nal. 1975; Mulligan and Bennett 1977\/8; Grant 1988; Jerrome 1991).\nThe reduction of isolation and loneliness is seen as a main aim by most\npersonnel in the charitable groups which organise clubs for older\npeople and by similar statutory day care providers (Jerrome 1991).\nChanges in levels of isolation and loneliness have been used as outcome\nmeasures in the evaluation of various interventions (Challis 1982).\nThe first part of this paper reviews the literature on social isolation\nand loneliness. The relationship between isolation and loneliness is\ndiscussed and the reported correlates of isolation and loneliness\nidentified. Subsequently, a statistical modelling technique is employed\nin an effort to refine earlier analyses, based on longitudinal data from\na study conducted with elderly people living in the community in\nNorth Wales.\nWhile social isolation and loneliness are seen as common problems of\nold age, the prevalence of these problems is likely to have been over-\nestimated. It has been suggested that social isolation is not widespread\nexcept among the very old (Peters and Kaiser 1985; Freeman 1988).\nHowever, advancing age predisposes people to those experiences which\ncan lead to isolation: bereavement, relocation (moving) and retirement\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 335\n(Hovaguimian et al. 1988), although different patterns of isolation have\nbeen identified which include both those who become isolated in old\nage and those who are life-long isolates (Bennett 1980, Wenger 1992 a).\nThe largest survey on loneliness, conducted in the United States by\nHarris and Associates (1974), found that for elderly people it was less\nimportant than fear of crime, poor health and inadequate income. The\nsurvey was repeated in 1981 with similar findings (Harris et al. 1981).\nA European study found that the prevalence of loneliness shows no\nsignificant difference between age groups (Tornstam 1981).\nThe correlates of isolation and loneliness\nDespite the absence of a direct link between isolation and loneliness\n(Wenger 1983, 1984^), many of the same factors are associated with\nboth. Different writers have looked at different variables, some\nconcentrating on demographic and others on behavioural correlates.\nInterpretations are not always consistent so that no unified model of\nisolation or loneliness exists.\nBoth isolation and loneliness have been shown to be more common\nfor women than for men (Qureshi and Walker 1989), but this is largely\ndue to the fact that women are more likely to be widowed and living\nalone, both factors being important correlates for men and women.\nHowever, a study in the US (Mullins and Mushel 1992) found that\nmen were more lonely than women. The association with advanced age\n(Wenger 1983) can also be explained in terms of the greater likelihood\nof being widowed and living alone, although some of the isolation\nassociated with longevity results from outliving one's contemporaries\n(Hadley and Webb 1974). However, Bury and Holme (1990) found\nthat even in a study of people over 90, 61 per cent said they were never\nlonely. Table 1 summarises the prevalence of loneliness from a range of\nstudies.\nIn some studies living alone has been equated with social isolation\nand in all studies of isolation living alone appears to be a sine qua non of\nthe definition, for while not all those living alone are isolated, nearly all\nthose who are isolated live alone. Loneliness is not directly associated\nwith living alone. Many who live alone live fully integrated socially\nactive lives (Larsen et al. 1985), however, loneliness is more common\namongst those living alone (Havinghurst 1978; Hunt 1978; Wenger\n1983). The evidence indicates that intimate relationships outside the\nfamily may be more important than family relationships (Abrams\n1974; Bengtson and Kuypers 1985).\n336 G.

However, the relationship between widowhood and\nloneliness is reported in nearly all studies, some of which have noted\nthat it is most intense in early widowhood (Sheldon 1948; Berardo 1967;\nShanas et al. 1968; Townsend and Tunstall 1973; Whittington 1977;\nHunt 1978; Kivett 1979; Power 1980; Wenger 1983), when the loss of\nan intimate companion is most painful.\nIt has been claimed that loneliness amongst widows may be\nameliorated by visits from children. However, it has been found that\nsuch visits make little impact on loneliness (Hadley et al. 1975; Arling\n1980), and very old widows living with children are frequently amongst\nthe most lonely (Townsend and Tunstall 1973; Wenger 1983). Absence\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 337\nof children has been identified as being associated with both isolation\n(Palmore 1976) and loneliness (Shanas et al. 1968; Townsend and\nTunstall 1973), but Weeks and Cuellar (1981) found that while elderly\npeople may turn to the family for instrumental help, they are least\nlikely to do so in times of loneliness. In contrast, a study in Sweden\nfound that loneliness is related inversely to frequency of contact with\nchildren and friends but not neighbours (Berg et al. 1981). Mullins and\nMushel (1992) found that loneliness was unrelated to the availability\nof spouse or children but that the existence of friends was significant.\nThe importance of friends has also been identified by other authors\n(Wenger 1983; Jerrome 1991). It has been shown that most of the\nobjective measures of social isolation are unrelated to the subjective\nmeasures of well-being, although companionship and the availability of\nconfidant relationships are significant (Chappell and Badger 1989).\nOther research has shown that those without a confiding relationship\nare more subject than others to depression (Murphy 1982).\nSingleness has also been associated with both isolation (Shanas et al.\n1968; Lowenthal and Robinson 1976; Palmore 1976) and loneliness\n(Shanas et al. 1968; Hadley and Webb 1974; Kivett 1979; Wenger\n1984\/*), although Townsend and Tunstall (1973) claim that single\npeople are less lonely. Part of the reason for such disagreement is likely\nto stem from bivariate analyses without any control variables. In\naddition to marital status, loneliness has been associated with loss of\nany close relationship (Townsend and Tunstall 1973; Hadley and\nWebb 1974; Mullins et al. 1988); changes in social contacts (Kivett\n1979); reliance on a single close relationship (Hadley and Webb 1974);\nand, on loss in general (Shanas et al. 1968; Power 1980).\nOther authors (Shanas et al. 1968; Abrams 1974) emphasise that\nloneliness is more closely associated with loss than with isolation. Thus\nloneliness is found to be more common among recent isolates than life-\nlong isolates (Townsend and Tunstall 1973; Bennett 1980) and\nassociated with the experience of loss or death of members of the close\nsocial network (Townsend 1968; Hadley and Webb 1974; Mullins et al.\n1988). Both isolation and loneliness have been identified as being\nassociated with retirement migration and thus disruption of the social\nnetwork (Whittington 1977; Wenger 19846; Fitzgerald 1986). This\nlatter point is in contrast with long-standing isolation which is more\noften associated with a failure to develop a social network in earlier life\n(Hadley and Webb 1974).\nSocial class status has been found to be associated with isolation but\nnot loneliness. Working class older people appear to be more likely than\nothers to become isolated (Blum 1964; Lowenthal and Robinson 1976).\n338 G. Clare Wenger et al.\nWorking class elders are also more likely to become depressed (Murphy\n1982).\nBoth isolation and loneliness are associated with poor health and\/or\nloss of mobility. Evidence presented elsewhere suggests that social stress\nmay trigger poor health (Dean and Lin 1977; Murphy 1987; Grant\n1988), although loneliness may result from restricted contacts with\nothers due to ill health (Jerrome 1991). Loneliness is associated with the\namount of contact with health professionals, and use of medicines (Asiel\n1987). It has also been shown to be connected with general disability\n(Jones et al. 1985). The causal relationship is not clear cut. Isolation\nand loneliness may lead to ill health, the causal link may be in the other\ndirection or the connections may be circular. Correlations have been\nfound between poor health and isolation (Lowenthal 1964; Hadley and\nWebb 1974; Lowenthal and Robinson 1976; Lynch 1977) and between\npoor health and loneliness (Townsend and Tunstall 1973; Kivett 1979;\nPower 1980; Wenger 1984b; Jones et al. 1985; Asiel 1987; Mullins et al.\n1988). Mullins et al. (1988) go so far as to say that health is the best\npredictor of loneliness. Mortality has been associated with both\nisolation (Berkman and Syme 1979; Abrams 1983) and loneliness\n(Abrams 1983).\nThe main link between loneliness and mental illness appears to be\nthe likelihood of lonely people becoming depressed (Thompson 1973).\nThe relationship between depression and loneliness is further empha-\nsised by findings that link childhood loss or an unsafe childhood with\nlater depression (Brown and Harris 1978) and loneliness in adulthood\n(Seabrook 1973; Tornstam 1989). However, at least one author, taking\na psychoanalytic approach finds that both neglect and too much\nattention in the context of a secluded childhood can lead to loneliness\nin old age (Andersson 1990). Severe life events in the preceding year\nhave also been linked to the onset of depression (Murphy 1982, 1983).\nIsolation and loneliness have also been shown to be associated with\nadmissions to residential care (Townsend and Tunstall 1973; Ross and\nKedward 1976; Wenger 1984a; Koedoot and Hommel 1993), while\nthose who are isolated demonstrate poor stroke rehabilitation levels\n(Hyman 1972). Jerrome (1982) and Elias (1986) have noted that dying\nis both a lonely and for many an isolated experience.\nBoth isolation (Brocklehurst 1978) and loneliness (Wenger 19846,\n19926) have been associated with low morale, although Wenger\n(19846) found that those who were isolated had better health and\nhigher morale than those who were lonely. While poor physical health\nis related to both social isolation and loneliness, only isolation appears\nto be highly correlated with mental disorder (Lowenthal 1964; Hadley\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 339\nT A B L E 2.

This suggests a causal relationship, i.e. (late developing) isolation\nmay lead to mental disorder rather than the other way round. There\nis an indication here that loss is associated with mental health\nproblems. However, only prospective studies can fruitfully examine\nthese links.\nThe identified correlates of isolation and loneliness are summarised\nin Table 2. In the remainder of this paper we present statistical models\nof isolation and loneliness which control for interrelationships between\nvariables.\nFindings from North Wales study\nThe findings presented in the remainder of this paper come from the\nfirst phase of a four phase longitudinal study of ageing conducted in\nNorth Wales 1978-1991. The sample was selected from the total\ncommunity of elderly people living at home in a range of representative\nsettlement types in rural North Wales, and the achieved sample was\n340 G. Clare Wenger et al.\nrepresentative of the numbers living in different community types for\nthat rural region. The project was based on a 1979 survey of 534 elderly\npeople 65+ living in the community. Survivors have been re-\ninterviewed in 1983, 1987, 1991 and 1995.\nWe present here the results of cross-sectional multivariate analyses of\nthe baseline 1979 data. The objective is to arrive at refined models of\nisolation and loneliness which identify and include the main ex-\nplanatory variables from our list of possible correlates.\nBuilding statistical models of isolation and loneliness\nModels are established for (1) social isolation, (2) loneliness based on\nan aggregate measure and (3) self-assessed loneliness.\nIsolation was measured on an aggregate scale based upon eight\nobjective items: lives alone; has no close relatives; never visits relatives\nor friends; has no contact with neighbours; has no telephone; is alone\nfor more than 9 hours a day; lives more than 50 years from nearest\nneighbour; and is housebound. One isolation point was scored for each\nitem, giving a maximum isolation measure (IM) score of 8 and a\nminimum of o.\nAn aggregate scale was also designed to measure loneliness but, in this\ncase, the contributing items had a subjective emphasis. Only one of the\nquestions actually mentioned loneliness (although another item allowed\nloneliness as an element in the response), thus seeking to overcome the\nstigma of loneliness and resistance to admitting that one was lonely (see\nWenger, 1983). The eight items were: feels lonely much of the time;\ndoes not see enough of friends and relatives; does not meet enough\npeople; has no one to confide in; wishes for more friends; has no one\nto ask favours of; has no real friends in the area; and spent the previous\nChristmas alone and lonely. The last item was coded from the response\nto an open question in which 'alone by choice' was another category.\nThis loneliness measure is referred to subsequently as LM.\nThe third measure is a self-assessment of loneliness (SAL) for each\nrespondent, with five response categories. This item was reduced to a\ntwo-category variable with 'never' and 'rarely' lonely combined into\na 'not lonely' category, and 'sometimes', 'often' and 'most of the time'\ncombined into a 'lonely' category.\nThe software package GLIM (Francis et al. 1993) was used for the\nanalyses. A conventional linear regression model was appropriate for\nthe continuous response variable IM and a logistic regression model for\nthe binary response variable SAL. The response variable LM was more\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 341\nproblematic. It is positively skewed with around 60 per cent of the\nresponses on the lowest end of the scale. It was decided to recode this\ncontinuous variable into three categories: 'not lonely' (a score of 0),\n'medium' (a score of 1 or 2) and 'high' (a score of 3 or higher) on the\nbasis of earlier work (see Wenger 19846). A multinominal logistic\nmodel was then fitted to these data.\nEleven explanatory variables supported by previous work (see Table\n2 - marital status constituted one variable, subsuming widowhood and\nsingleness) were available for inclusion in the models. The list was\naugmented by seven more measures: number of years widowed,\nincome, network type (Wenger 1989, see appendix), ethnicity (Welsh\/\nnon-Welsh); wish for more friends, having a confidant, and the time\nthey have known their confidant. Seven variables dependent on the\nrespondent's subjective assessment or response, or feelings, are classified\nas subjective (self-assessed health; activities limited by health; morale;\npresence of local friends; desire for more friends; presence of a\nconfidant and length of time known confidant). The number of years\nrespondent has known a confidant is included because the perception\nof having a confidant may be subjective. The analyses seek to establish\nmodels on the basis of the objective variables and then to test for the\neffect of subjective variables over and above the objective variables.\nWith this pragmatic approach, it is possible to obtain some indication\nas to whether the role of subjective variables is an additional and\ndistinct direct effect, an intervening effect, or the result of complex\ninteraction with the objective variables.\nA forward substitution method was used to guide the selection of a\npreferred model for each response variable. Explanatory variables were\nentered in the model one at a time and their effect was tested for\nstatistical significance. The most significant variable was then added to\nthe model and the process repeated until none of the remaining\nvariables was significant. In the case of two or more variables of similar\nsignificance at any iteration, two or more models were developed and\ngoodness-of-fit criteria were used to choose between the final results. At\neach iteration, variables not significant at 5 per cent were dropped from\nthe analysis (see Appendix B).\nIsolation model\nSince household composition and the existence of close relatives\ncontributed towards the definition of the isolation measure (IM), these\nvariables (household composition and childlessness) were excluded\nfrom the analysis of IM. All the other variables except age of arrival in\n342 G.

After controlling for this variable, age, sex and income\ncease to be significant. Subsequently, the variables number of years\nwidowed, social class, and network type enter the model in that order.\nIn stage 2, with the parameter estimates of the objective model held\nfixed, the variable 'length of time they have known a confidant' is\nhighly significant and enters the model.

Thus, at this stage, the model includes two subjective\nvariables in addition to the objective variables from stage 1.\nWhen model fitting is repeated without distinguishing between\nobjective and subjective variables, exactly the same set of explanatory\nvariables appear in the final model; the results are encouragingly\nrobust.\nThe resulting Model of Isolation includes: marital status; number of\nyears widowed; social class; support network type; morale; and length\nof time respondent has known their present confidant.\nSelf-assessed Loneliness (SAL) model\nFor the analysis of self-assessed loneliness the objective variables age,\nparenthood, arrival age, social class and ethnicity are all non-significant\nat the 5 per cent level when included on their own in the model.\nMarital status again enters the model first.

All the subjective\nmeasures, apart from the two health measures, are defining variables\nfor LM. They are, therefore, ignored in the analysis. Self-assessed\nhealth enters first in stage 2. This does not affect the objective model,\nbut health limited activities ceases to be significant.\nThe resulting Model of the Loneliness Measure, includes household\ncomposition; support network type; ethnicity and self-assessed health.\nDiscussion of the models\nUsing a multivariate modelling technique, it has been possible to refine\nthe models of isolation and loneliness, reducing the number of\nsignificant correlates and identifying those which remain important\nwhen allowing for the associations between variables.\nIsolation\nIn refining the model of isolation, the number of correlates was reduced\nfrom the 12 which are significant on their own to just 6 variables. The\nparameter estimates for the stage 1 model and for the final model\nincluding both objective and subjective variables are given in Table 3.\n(The parameter estimates for the subjective variables at stage 2, when\nthe objective parameters were fixed at their Stage 1 values, were close\nto those of the final model.). The coefficients for the objective variables\nchange little when the subjective variables are added, indicating that\nthe model gives a robust picture of the effect of the objective variables.\nThe results suggest that the variable marital status is significantly\nrelated to social isolation: married respondents appear to be less likely\nto be isolated than those who have never married, or have been\nwidowed. Moreover, for the widowed, isolation tends to increase with\n344 G. Clare Wenger et al.\nT A B L E 3.

The\nassociation with low morale is likely to reflect the lowered morale of\nthose who become socially isolated but may equally well indicate\nwithdrawal on the part of those whose morale is low.\nWhat seems clear from this analysis is that social isolation appears to\narise from factors which are largely beyond the control of the individual\n346 G. Clare Wenger et al.\nand which are, therefore, not obviously susceptible to amelioration.\nPractitioners should be aware of the predisposing factors and maintain\ncloser monitoring and surveillance of those recognised to be at risk of\nsocial isolation.\nLoneliness\nWe have produced two separate loneliness models, one based on self-\nassessment and another based on an aggregate measure, which it has\nbeen suggested is more objective and overcomes feelings of stigma\nwhich may influence responses (Wenger 1983).\nFor self-assessed loneliness the number of significant correlates was\nagain halved from 12 to 6 in the multivariate analysis. Only 7\nexplanatory variables were significant on their own for the aggregate\nloneliness measure and these were reduced to 4 by the multivariate\nanalysis. The parameter estimates for the loneliness models are given in\nTables 4 and 5 respectively.\nAgain, the general pattern of the parameter estimate for the\nobjective variables in the Stage 1 models is maintained in the final\nmodels when the subjective variables are added.\nIn the SAL model, the parameter estimates for marital status and\nhousehold composition increase with the inclusion of the subjective\nvariables, while those for network type generally decrease. In a logistic\nmodel, this is consistent with the effect of the subjective variables being\nindependent of marital status and household composition, but\ninteracting with network type to reduce its effect. Network type is\nbased upon both demographic criteria, such as availability of local kin,\nand social activity. It may be that the subjective variables are acting to\nsubstitute for part of the social component.\nThe inclusion of state of health in the model for LM has very little\neffect on the model, although there is some limited evidence for an\ninteraction with network type as for SAL. This is not surprising since\nshifts in support network type are associated with the deterioration of\nhealth and\/or growing frailty. Shifts are not inevitable but where they\ndo occur, they are modally from more to less independent network\ntypes (Wenger and Scott 1994).\nThree variables are significant in both of the loneliness models:\nnetwork type, household composition and self-assessed health. Unsur-\nprisingly, those with support networks which provide high levels of\nsocial contact and interaction - locally-integrated and wider com-\nmunity-focused networks - are less likely to be lonely. In the LM\nmodel, the effect increases steadily across the three categories: 'not\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 347\nT A B L E 5.

Living with others and maintaining\ngood health may, however, mitigate the effects of poor network\nsupport. These two factors and ethnicity discriminate mainly between\nthe 'not lonely' and 'medium\/high loneliness' groups.\n348 G. Clare Wenger et al.\nAn earlier analysis (Wenger 1983), comparing self-assessed with LM\nloneliness found that widows appeared to be more willing to admit to\nloneliness and suggested that self-assessment may under-measure\nloneliness for other groups. The presence of marital status only in the\nSAL model is consistent with this conclusion. The wish for more friends\nwas used as an item in the LM and so was omitted from the modelling\nexercise for this reason. The presence of ethnicity in the LM model is\nalso significant and it was suggested earlier (Wenger 1983) that those\nwho had moved into Wales, many on retirement, may also be unwilling\nto admit to loneliness, explaining why ethnicity is not significant for the\nSAL model. There are parallels here with a recent US study (Mullen\nand Mushel 1992) which found loneliness to be related to gender,\nhealth status, economic condition, need for affection and the desire to\nbe part of a social network.\nThe variable 'time known confidant' entered the model for self-\nassessed loneliness last of the six variables. Although the overall effect\nwas just significant (P = 0.04), the individual parameter estimates are\nall smaller than their standard errors and do not show a consistent\ntrend. Since having a confidant was not significant when other\nvariables were controlled for, it is likely that this apparent effect is an\nartefact of the data.\nThe differences between the SAL and the LM models alert\npractitioners to remain aware of the stigma of loneliness, which may\nnot be admitted by those who have no socially acceptable reason to be\nlonely, such as being widowed. Again, two of the major contributory\nfactors to loneliness - network type and household composition - are\nnot susceptible to amelioration. Curative or palliative treatment may,\nhowever, reduce the impact of poor health. Here too practitioners need\nto be aware of the predisposing factors.\nDiscussion of the results\nThe results of the model fitting are summarised in Table 6 and 7. Table\n6 shows which of the variables in the North Wales Study had previously\nbeen identified as associated with isolation and\/or loneliness (Table 2).\nFour variables, age, gender, childlessness and retirement migration\ncease to be significant for any of the measures when controlling for the\nother variables in a multivariate analysis (although ethnicity probably\nacts as a proxy for retirement migration in the aggregate loneliness\nmeasure).\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 349\nT A B L E 6.

Clare Wenger et al.\nThree variables are present in all three models: household\ncomposition, morale and support network type. However, only network\ntype is not included in the operational definitions of the variables of\ninterest. Household composition (i.e. living alone) was a defining item\nfor isolation, and the Philadelphia Geriatric Center morale measure\nused includes a loneliness component. Two further variables are\nassociated with isolation and self-assessed loneliness but not with the\naggregate loneliness measure: marital status and the length of time\nrespondents have known a confidant. Singleness and widowhood are\nassociated with social isolation, but only widowhood with self-assessed\nloneliness (Table 7). Of these five variables three had been previously\nidentified as associated with both isolation and loneliness. However,\ntwo new shared correlates have been identified: support network type\nand length of confidant relationship.\nTwo additional variables were identified as significant correlates of\nisolation but not loneliness: social class and number of years widowed.\nRestricted mobility (houseboundedness) was a defining item for\nisolation. The association with social class (working class status) has\npreviously been identified but the number of years widowed is a new\ncorrelate suggesting that the social isolation of widows increases over\ntime.\nThree variables are identified as correlates of loneliness but not\nisolation: self-assessed health, ethnicity and the desire for more friends.\nHealth and friends have previously been identified but ethnicity is a\nnew correlate which warrants further exploration. It is possible that\nWelsh ethnic identification also reflects class status since incomers are\nless likely to be blue collar working class (Table 7).\nLooking more closely at Table 7, which identifies the variable values\nassociated with isolation and loneliness, some of the overlaps and\ndiscontinuities can be explored further. The table distinguishes between\nobjective and subjective variables. Some variables are more difficult\nthan others to categorise because self-assessments can be affected by the\nemotional state of the respondent. Self-assessed health is clearly one of\nthese. However, we have also classified the length of time respondents\nhad known their confidant as subjective since the perception of having\na confidant is likely to be subjective.\nThe outcome suggests that while the distinction between social\nisolation as an objective state and loneliness as a subjective state\ngenerally holds, the refined model indicates that it may not be so\nclearcut. As we might have previously suggested (Wenger 1983) self-\nassessed loneliness results from more subjective factors than loneliness\nbased on the aggregate measure. Whilst it is not possible to prove the\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 351\ndirection of causality, particular objective aspects of social isolation\nappear to predispose older people to loneliness: widowhood, living\nalone and support network type. Also, some of the subjective variable\ncorrelates of loneliness may exacerbate social isolation: self-assessed\npoor health (leading to restricted mobility) and low morale.\nFinally, it is emphasised that some potentially significant correlates\nwere not available in the North Wales data set. These may be\ncharacterised as possible outcome variables resulting from isolation\nand\/or loneliness. Mortality and admission to residential care have\nbeen found to be correlated with both isolation and loneliness. Isolation\nhas further been linked with poor rehabilitation and mental illness; and\nloneliness with depression. Both are associated with low morale. The\nimportance of network type for both isolation and loneliness suggests\nthat interventions at the network level which increase contact and\ninteraction are likely to have preventative outcomes in terms of loss of\nindependence and health maintenance as well as improving quality of\nlife. Further work using longitudinal data and looking prospectively at\nchange and the correlates of changes will make it possible to explore\nfurther the inter-relationships between isolation, loneliness and other\nvariables.\nReferences\nAbrams, Mark. 1974.

Five support network types were\nidentified on the basis of the following factors:\n(1) the availability of local close kin\n(2) the level of involvement of family, friends and neighbours and\n(3) the level of interaction with the community and voluntary\ngroups.\nThe networks are named on the basis of the nature of the old person's\nrelationship to the support network. The first three types are based on\nthe presence of local kin, the other two types reflect the absence of local\nkin:\n(1) Local family dependent\n(2) Locally integrated\n(3) Local self-contained\n(4) Wider community focused\n(5) Private restricted.\n356 G. Clare Wenger et al.\nThe five networks identified can be summarised as follows:\n(1) The local family dependent support network has primary focus on\nclose local family ties with few peripheral friends and neighbours.\nIt is often based on a shared household with, or near to, an adult\nchild, usually a daughter. Community involvement is generally\nlow. All support needs are met by relatives. These networks tend to\nbe small and the elderly people are more likely to be widowed,\nolder and in less good health than those with other types of\nnetworks.\n(2) The locally integrated support network includes close relationships\nwith local family, friends and neighbours. Many neighbours are\nalso friends. Usually based on long-term residence and active\ncommunity involvement in church and voluntary organisations in\nthe present or recent past. These networks tend to be larger on\naverage than others.\n(3) The local self-contained support network typically has arms-length\nrelationships or infrequent contact with at least one relative living\nin the same or adjacent community or neighbourhood, often a\nsibling, niece or nephew. Childlessness is common. Reliance is\nfocused on neighbours but elderly people with this type of network\ntend to adopt a household-focused life-style and community\ninvolvement, if any, tends to be low key. Networks tend to be\nsmaller than average.\n(4) The wider community focused support network is associated with\nactive relationships with distant relatives, usually children and\nhigh salience of friends and neighbours. Absence of local kin is\ntypical. The distinction between friends and neighbours is\nmaintained. The old people are generally involved in community\nand\/or voluntary organisations. This type of network is frequently\nassociated with retirement migration and is commonly middle class\nor skilled working class adaptation. Networks are larger than\naverage.\n(5) The private restricted support network is typically associated with\nabsence of local kin, other than in some cases a spouse, although a\nhigh proportion are married. Contact with neighbours is minimal.\nThese old people have few nearby friends and a low level of\ncommunity contacts or involvements. The network type subsumes\ntwo sub-types: independent married couples and dependent elderly\npersons who have withdrawn or become isolated from local\nSocial Isolation and Loneliness in Old Age 357\ninvolvement. In many cases a low level of social contact represents\na lifelong adaptation. Networks are smaller than average.\nAppendix B - Statistical details of model building\nCross-sectional analysis of isolation measure, (N = 498) - cell values\nare \/rvalues based on F-ratio test, ' IN' indicates a selected variable\nwhich remains in the model\nExplanatory variables\nAge\nSex\nMarital status\nSocial class\nEthnicity\nArrival age\nYears widowed\nIncome\nNetwork type\nSubjective variables\nHealth\nHealth limited activities\nMorale\nPresence of friends\nWish for more\nConfidant\nYears known confidant\nR2\n*\n*\nO.OI\n0.68\n0.17\n*\n*\n\u00b0-97\n0.71\n*\n0.03\n0.02\n*\n*\nStage 1\n0.11\n0.6\nIN IN IN\n0.001 * IN\n* IN IN\n0.09\n* * 0.002\nIN\nIN\nIN\nIN\n0.32\nFIXED\nFIXED\nFIXED\nFIXED\n*\n0.03\n0.03\n0.001\nStage 2\nFIXED\nFIXED\nFIXED\nFIXED\n0.01\nO.IO\n0.13\n0.17\nIN\nFIXED\nFIXED\nFIXED\nFIXED\nIN\nIN\n\u00b0-39\n*p < 0.0001.\nCross-sectional analysis of self-assessed loneliness (N = 498) cell values\nare\/^-values based on likelihood ratio test %2, ' IN ' indicates a\nselected variable which remains in the model.\nExplanatory variables\nConstant\nObjective Measures\nSex\nAge\nMarital status\nNumber of years widow\nHousehold composition\nNetwork type\nIncome\nIN\n*\n0.07\n*\n0.02\n*\n*\n*\nStage\nIN\n0.14\n-\nIN\n0.17\n*\n*\n0.29\n1\nIN\n-\n-\nIN\n-\n*\nIN\n-\nIN\n-\n-\nIN\n-\nIN\nIN\n-\nIN\n-\n-\nIN\n-\nIN\nIN\n-\nStage\nIN\n-\n-\nIN\n-\nIN\nIN\n-\n2\nIN\n-\n-\nIN\n-\nIN\nIN\n-\nIN\n-\n-\nIN\n-\nIN\nIN\n-\n358 G.
