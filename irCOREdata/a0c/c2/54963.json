It \nis important to note that the primary intention of the \nauthors is to provoke discussion on the suitability of \nsuch environments as locations within which to situate \npervasive games, rather than to conduct a thorough \nexperimental evaluation of this particular game.   \nPervasive games [10, 16] are entertainment \napplications in which the real-world is used as a game-\nboard and the alternate reality of the game-world is \nexposed to the player via some form of pervasive \ntechnology such as a mobile phone [13]. Pervasive \ngames aim to provide new and engaging experiences \nfor players by harvesting information about the user\u2019s \ncontext and incorporating it within the structure of the \ngame. These games typically take the form of treasure \nhunts, where repetitive activities such as the daily \ncommute to work, or the weekly shopping trip, may be \nenhanced via a fantasy narrative, or with a goal-\ndirected game-world task. Example tasks include the \nvisiting of new places or discovering of virtual objects in \nreal space in order to gain points or access to new \ntypes of task [15].  \nThe currently popular treasure hunt-style pervasive \ngames aim to use interesting game elements to \nenhance the supposed uninteresting, bland, or boring \nreal-world environments of game-players.  In doing so, \nthese games typically fail to take advantage of any \ninteresting or unique elements of that real-world \nenvironment that may enhance the user experience.  \nThey are typically not designed to interact with \nenvironments that are already interesting, engaging, or \nthat invoke emotional reactions in people.  Indeed, it \ncould be argued that the most interesting potential \napplication of pervasive games lies in the careful \nmatching of game-world tasks to the particular features \nof the real-world environment that the player is \ncurrently experiencing.  Pervasive games that do \ncarefully assign tasks to the player according to the \nunique features of the player\u2019s particular context have \nthe potential to provide hugely enjoyable, novel and \nthought-provoking experiences for players.   \nOne possibility for providing interesting and thought-\nprovoking experiences to players of pervasive games is \nto situate those games in places that are not \ntraditionally thought of as playful or fun.  One can \nimagine the cognitive and emotional impact of playing a \ngun fighting game at a shooting victim\u2019s funeral, or a \ndisease-spreading game on a hospital ward.  We \nbelieve that such experiences would offer the game \nplayer a unique opportunity to reflect on both the \nnature of game playing and the nature of the \nenvironment in which they are being played, while also \nproviding a unique and engaging game-play experience \n(see [6]).  \nThis paper describes the application Blowtooth, which \nhas been developed to create interesting interactions \nbetween game players and a very unique and \nchallenging environment: international airports.  \nBlowtooth is specifically designed to exploit the \naffordances of this environment in which people are \nsubject to particularly high levels of intrusive \nsurveillance and security monitoring [19]; indeed \nairports are places that previous researchers have \nidentified as unsuitable for pervasive game playing \n[11]. In everyday experience surveillance such as that \nencountered at airports can be both simultaneously \n 3 \nthrilling and frightening; the possibility of harnessing \nthese sensations in a game, or indeed any other art \nform, has great potential [1]. Thus, airports appear to \nbe the ideal extreme environment in which to explore \nthe process of enhancing pervasive game-play \nexperiences through careful matching of game-world \ntasks to the particular features of a player\u2019s real-world \nenvironment.  \nIn addition to demonstrating how the unique features \nof the real-world environment may enhance users\u2019 \nexperience of pervasive games, Blowtooth, in \nconcentrating heavily on the features of the social and \nphysical environment of the airport, has the potential to \nprovide commentary and the opportunity for reflection \non the nature of that environment itself.  As such it \nmay be considered a critical game [6]. Critical games \nare designed to stimulate critical thinking about \nimportant social, political or physical structures.  While \nBlowtooth was not designed solely with this purpose in \nmind, it certainly has the potential to stimulate critical \nthinking in users on the nature of the airport \nenvironment. \nTo our knowledge, no existing games have specifically \nexploited the uniqueness of the airport experience as \nthe backdrop to a pervasive game. In this context, we \nset out to design a game that combined widely-\navailable and simple technology, and a requirement for \nparticipants to interact with some interesting and \nunique features of the airport environment, in order to \ncreate a novel, engaging and thought-provoking \nexperience for the player. \nTHE UNIQUENESS OF AIRPORTS \nThe airport constitutes a very different type of place to \nthat which we usually inhabit in our everyday lives.  \nAirports have attracted the attention of researchers \nfrom disciplines as diverse as anthropology, sociology, \nsocial psychology and political science, who have each \nattempted to explain the unique effect of the airport on \nthose who use them. Airports have been described \nvariously as: national frontiers in the middle of a \ncountry, as cities, as transition spaces, places for \ncommercial interchange, non-places, sites of \nsurveillance, crossroads, symbols of mobility, and no-\nmans land (see [8] for in-depth discussion of these \npoints). Many writers (e.g. [5]) have also talked about \nairports as constituting a non-place [2] i.e. a place that \npeople pass through without meeting, and co-exist in \nwithout living together. Such places are typically \ninherently uniform to the point that they resist any \nemotional attachment or sense of belonging [7]. \nIt is commonly noted that the airport is a place that \ngenerates tension and anxiety amongst travellers, staff \nand officials alike [17].  Indeed, airports have been \ndescribed as constituting the most authoritarian facility \ndesigned for the use of free civilians, an authoritative \nstructure rivalled only by army bases and maximum-\nsecurity prisons [8]. Kellerman [8] describes the \nmovement of passengers through the various security \nchecks imposed by airport authorities in great detail \nand discusses the impact of these checks on the \nexperience of the international traveller. Throughout \nthis analysis he draws attention to the ubiquitous \npresence and power of authority figures and the effect \nof causing tension and anxiety amongst travellers, staff \nand officials alike (see also [18]). Indeed, airports are \nplaces in which oppressive control technologies are \n 4 \nimplemented and people\u2019s expectations of privacy are \naltered. Authorities have extra powers to search and \ndetain individuals and there are different expectations \non travellers\u2019 behaviour than would be expected outside \nof this context.  \nGAME DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION \nBlowtooth is designed with a fictional narrative that is \ndeliberately provocative given the environment in which \nit is set.  Game-play involves the covert smuggling of a \nvirtual cache of illegal drugs through real airport \nsecurity checks. From a player\u2019s perspective, the game \nbegins when they reach the airport, by planting small \namounts of contraband on unwitting fellow travellers. \nPlayers are encouraged to do so in places where groups \nof passengers tend to congregate, such as check-in \nlines, cafes, and information screens.  When the player \nis satisfied that enough drugs have been stashed, the \ngame forces a wait of ten minutes before the second \nphase of the game begins. In this phase, the player \nmust retrieve as much of their stash as possible, once it \nis \u201csafe\u201d to do so.  Specifically, players must seek out \nthose passengers who they have stashed their drugs on \nat the other side of the airport security check. Players \nare awarded points based on how many of the original \n\u201cpatsies\u201d can be found on the other side of the security \ncheck, and the length of time taken to retrieve the \ndrugs. In essence, players must use their phones after \npassing through security to identify people that they \nhave encountered before passing through security. \nIn reality, of course, no drugs are involved and the \ngame simply polls a player\u2019s vicinity for Bluetooth \ndevices, produces an internal list of these nearby \ndevices and allows the player to conceptually dump or \nretrieve contraband. No interaction with the other \ndevices is made other than to discover it\u2019s unique, \nanonymous and factory allocated hardware address. In \naddition, the \u201cpatsies\u201d or drug mules are never made \naware that they were involved in the game.  While the \ntechnology required to play this game is not novel or \ninnovative, we feel that the combination of the drug \nsmuggling narrative, the task of finding previously \ntagged passengers and the high security airport \nenvironment should produce a unique and engaging \nexperience for players. \nBlowtooth is implemented on Bluetooth-enabled mobile \nsmart-phones and exploits the fact that many people in \nairports also carry powered up, Bluetooth-discoverable, \nmobile devices. A number of studies elsewhere have \ndemonstrated the ubiquity of personal Bluetooth-\nenabled devices in everyday environments (see [20] for \na short review). The game has been implemented using \nthe Java Micro Edition (formerly J2ME) and is available \nas an experimental prototype from \nhttp:\/\/www.blowtooth.com. The game is compatible \n   \n \n \n \nFigure 2. A participant playing Blowtooth in the \nLondon Heathrow Terminal 5 security area. \n \nFigure 1.

Blowtooth running on a Nokia N95 device \n \nEvaluation \nThe current study investigates a number of themes \nrelevant to pervasive game playing in unique and \nchallenging environments.  Specifically, we expect the \ndrug-smuggling narrative of the Blowtooth game to \ncreate a highly engaging experience.  In the context of \na high-security airport environment, we expected that \nthe playing of Blowtooth would affect participants\u2019 self-\nreported levels of anxiety.  \nWe were also interested in whether participants felt \ncomfortable engaging with a narrative based on illegal \nactivity whilst in a high-security environment.  In other \nwords; did the matching of game task to the high-\nsecurity real-world environment result in a game that \nparticipants wanted to play, or enjoyed playing.   \nA further issue of interest relates to the potential of \nBlowtooth as a critical game; we were interested \nwhether the security-conscious narrative of the game \naffected participant\u2019s experience of the high-security \nairport environment. Specifically, we expected the \ndrug-smuggling narrative of the Blowtooth game to \naffect participants\u2019 awareness of both security and their \nfellow passengers. \nWe were also interested in whether participants felt \ncomfortable with the requirement to interact with non-\nplayers, particularly in terms of the requirement to \nseek out and find tagged fellow passengers after they \nhad passed through security checks.  \nIn order to evaluate these issues, six participants were \nrecruited from personal contacts and acquaintances of \nthe authors. All participants were travelling \ninternationally within two weeks of the trial dates. \nThese participants downloaded and played the \nBlowtooth game while travelling through an airport, \nbefore answering a questionnaire featuring both open-\nended questions regarding the participants\u2019 experiences \nof the game and context, plus two separate \nquantitative scales.  The first of these presented a \nnumber of questions taken from an established \nquestionnaire that was developed as a part of a major \nEU project (FUGA) aimed at developing tools for \nmeasuring and evaluating player enjoyment in games \n[14].  The second, a short 12-item questionnaire, was \ndesigned to sample three factors; Anxiety, Security \nAwareness and Awareness of Other Passengers.  \nResults \nIn order to evaluate whether participants were \ncomfortable with, or indeed enjoyed, playing a game \n 6 \nwith a narrative based on illegal activities while in a \nhigh-security environment, a questionnaire was \ndistributed to all six participants who played the game.  \nThis questionnaire consisted of eight questions taken \nfrom the Games Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) [14] \ndesigned to measure enjoyment of digital games and \nanswered via a 5-point Likert scale.  \nFour of the seven factors in the GEQ were identified as \nuseful in the current context.  These were Competence, \nPositive Affect, Frustration and Negative Affect.  \nPositive affect refers to positive emotions such as \nhappiness and enjoyment, while negative affect refers \nto negative emotions such as boredom and tiredness.  \nTwo questions were chosen from the GEQ to probe for \neach of the four factors.  Results of the six game \nplayers\u2019 responses to these questions are presented in \ntable 1. \nTable 1. Mean scores for Competence, Positive \nAffect, Frustration and Negative Affect in Blowtooth \nplayers. \nCompetence Positive \nAffect \nFrustration Negative \nAffect \n3.16 \n(SD=1.16) \n3.75 \n(SD=1.21) \n1.41 \n(SD=1.02) \n1.66 \n(SD=1.69) \n \nTable 1 illustrates that the participants who played the \nBlowtooth game reported high levels of competence \nand positive affect, while also reporting low levels of \nfrustration and negative affect.  Thus, it appears \nparticipants were quite content to play the Blowtooth \ndrug smuggling game in the high-security environment \nof an international airport.  This result supports the \nassumption suggesting that matching pervasive game \ncontent to the unique features of a challenging \nenvironment can produce an enjoyable experience for \ngame players. \nThe current study also investigated the effect that \nplaying a security conscious game in a high-security \nenvironment had on participants\u2019 perceptions of that \nenvironment.  In order to do this, a questionnaire was \npresented to the six participants who played the \nBlowtooth game.  The questionnaire presented 12 \nquestions that probed for three overall factors; security \nawareness, anxiety and awareness of fellow \npassengers.  Questions were answered via a 5-point \nLikert scale. \nTable 2. Mean scores reported for security \nawareness, anxiety and awareness of fellow \npassengers. \nSecurity \nawareness \nAnxiety Awareness of \nfellow \npassengers \n2.75 \n(SD=1.25) \n2.5 (SD=1) 2.75 \n(SD=0.95) \n \nTable 2 suggests that participants who played \nBlowtooth did not report very high ratings of anxiety, \ndespite the provocative nature of the game narrative, \nand the high security environment.  In addition, \nparticipants did not report particularly high or low levels \nfor awareness of security personnel or awareness of \nfellow passengers.  This result is surprising, due to the \n 7 \ngame task, which required participants to interact with \nthese groups in ways that they would not normally. \nResults of these short questionnaires are certainly \nsurprising, as it was envisioned that Blowtooth would \nlead to anxiety in game players, and increased \nawareness and scrutiny of both security staff and the \nbehaviour of other passengers.  However, the sample \nsize (n=6) is very small, so responses to open-ended \nquestions was deemed equally, if not more valuable. \nThe open-ended questions presented to participants \nprobed a number of topics.   \nThe principal aim of the study was to investigate \nwhether the matching of game narrative and game \ntasks to a unique and challenging environment would \ncreate an engaging and enjoyable experience for game \nplayers. Participants generally reported that they \nenjoyed the drug-smuggling narrative of the game.  \nPartiticant 1 reported \u201cI liked the names for items and \npeople. They made it fun.\u201d Participant 2 stated \u201cI \nenjoyed the theme, it gave it a purpose,\u201d while \nParticipant 6 reported that the narrative \u201cworks, \nbecause you are at an airport and it fits together.\u201d  \nWe were interested in whether playing the game \naffected participants\u2019 behaviour and the emotions they \nexperienced while at the airport. While participants \nwere, \u201cvery aware it\u2019s just a game,\u201d they typically \nreported some anxiety caused by playing Blowtooth. \nParticipant 2 reported that they \u201cleft the game running \nwhilst going through security so was slightly concerned \nif they chose to search my bag I would have to explain \nwhat it was doing.\u201d  Participants 4 and 5 made sure \nthat their phone was locked when passing through \nsecurity so that staff would not see the distinctive \nblowtooth graphics.  Indeed, four of the six participants \nreported making minor adjustments to their behaviour \n(e.g. ensuring that their game screen, with the striking \ngraphics, could not be seen by security personnel) due \nto playing the game.  \nWe were interested in whether Blowtooth provoked \nparticipants to think more critically about the nature of \nairports.  Three participants reported that they noticed \ninteresting aspects of the airport environment that they \nhad not previously noticed. Specifically, participant 1 \n\u201cnoticed the ways the different airports \u2018herd\u2019 the \npassengers to their gates. Some get you there soon \nafter the security and you wait there, others have a \nmore general waiting area,\u201d while participant 2 \u201ctook \nmore notice of where other planes were taking off from, \nalso looked for places where large groups of people \ngathered.\u201d  It appears that playing Blowtooth provoked \nthese participants into more critical thinking about their \nsurroundings. \nWe were interested in whether Blowtooth provoked \nparticipants to think more critically about the nature of \nplay and the idea of playing games in high security \nenvironments.  None of the participants reported any \nunease with the drug-smuggling game narrative, nor \ndid any of the six Blowtooth players report feeling that \nthe airport was an unsuitable venue for pervasive \ngaming. Indeed, none of the participants reported that \nthey were worried about breaking the law while playing \nthe game.  When asked whether there was any \nenvironment in which it would be inappropriate to play \npervasive games, participants provided a number of \nimaginative responses such as funeral homes, \nchurches, hospitals, saunas, theatres\/cinemas, libraries \nand courtrooms.   \n 8 \nAs the game required participants to interact with \nother, unsuspecting, passengers, we were interested in \nwhat effect this requirement would have on \nparticipants\u2019 interactions with those fellow passengers.  \nParticipant 2 reported that it was \u201cfun guessing who the \nphones belonged to, for example sitting in a restaurant \nhaving my lunch 2 patsies were located just as two \nmen entered the restaurant.\u201d  Participant 6, noticed \n\u201cpeople i\u2019d seen before more frequently even if they \nweren\u2019t a bluetooth person.\u201d Participants did not appear \nto be worried about any ethical implications to do with \nplaying such games, with participant 5 even requesting \n\u201ca direction finder or distance finder to know how \n\u201cclose\u201d to a package I was.\u201d \nOverall, player comments appear to suggest that \nBlowtooth was an engaging, fun, and thought-\nprovoking experience that, importantly, \u201creally helped \nrelieve boredom,\u201d related to international travel. \nConclusions  \nThe current study investigated a number of themes \nrelevant to pervasive game playing in unique and \nchallenging environments. We found that players \nreported being content to engage in virtual drug \nsmuggling at airports and enjoyed doing so. It is \npossible that engaging in subversive games in tense \nenvironments actually has the result of relaxing those \ngame players.  This is an issue that merits further \nresearch. \nWe also found that Blowtooth provoked participants to \nthink more critically about both the nature of airports, \nand the idea of playing games in high security \nenvironments.  This is an exciting finding, as it \nsuggests that the process of carefully creating \npervasive game tasks that take advantage of the \nunique and challenging elements of \u201ctaboo\u201d \nenvironments in which they are played creates the \npossibility to construct engaging, thought-provoking \ncritical games about those environments. \nWe are aware that Blowtooth raises some interesting \nprivacy and ethical implications. It is clear that \nBlowtooth has an edginess and a risqu\u00e9 nature, due to \nthe authors intention to demonstrate the interesting \npossibilities of playing pervasive games in \nenvironments that are not traditionally thought of as \nplayful or fun. Indeed, it is conceivable that an \nenhanced version of this game that had server \nconnectivity could be used to derive information about \nwhich airports, or types of airports, are easier to \nsmuggle contraband trough. Indeed, it is possible that \nthe game in its current state could actually be used to \naid in the smuggling of real drugs through airports; it \nwould be simply a matter of substituting real drugs for \nthe virtual Bluetooth variety.  However, it must be \nremembered that the game is delivered in a playful and \ntongue-in-cheek manner through its user interface, \ngraphics and narrative and that all participants in the \ncurrent study mentioned how it was just a game.  Thus, \nthe game created an interesting and thought provoking \nexperience for participants, while remaining fun and not \ncausing undue amounts of anxiety. \nAdditionally, the notion of using \u2018non-players\u2019 as part of \na game mechanic is a common theme in pervasive \ngames that has been explored, for instance, in the EU \nFP6 iPerG project [12].  Indeed, none of the \nparticipants in the current study expressed any concern \nover the use of non-players.  In fact, some players \nexpressed a wish to have more powerful tools for \n 9 \nfinding those people after they had passed through \nsecurity.  \nIt appears that the carefully creating pervasive games \nthat take the nature of their context into account and \nincorporate it as part of a game structure may provide \nenjoyable and thought-provoking experiences for \nplayers, even in environments that would appear, at \nfirst, to be unsuitable locations for pervasive game \nplay.  \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank reviewers for interesting and useful \ncomments on a previous version of the manuscript. \nReferences \n1.
