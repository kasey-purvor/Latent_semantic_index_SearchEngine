Several scholars have highlighted the importance of knowledge and\ninformation management in an increasingly globalised, service oriented\nenvironment (Davenport and Probst, 2001; Wright et al., 2001) and some\nhave created models to link knowledge management to better performance\n(Edvinsson, 1997; Marr et al., 2004). However, very few have attempted to show\nan empirical link between KM and performance aside from theoretical models.\nLee and Choi (2003) as well as Hunter et al. (2002) state that no relationship\nbetween KM and performance has been empirically researched so far and a review\nof literature since these publications suggests that this is still true. Broady-Preston\nand Williams (2004) however have published a case study linking the use of\ninformation to increased performance, a case study that influenced the authors of\nthis paper in the design and delivery of this research project focussed on\nknowledge rather than information.\nCarrion et al. (2004) see consulting, software engineering, law firms and health\ncare as examples for knowledge-intensive service organisations, where KM is likely\nto make a difference, with some researchers arguing that law firms are among\nthe prime examples for the use of KM to improve performance because\n\u201cprofessional expertise and knowledge are both inputs and outputs in this sector\u201d\n(Hunter et al., 2002, p. 8). Knowledge input in the form of individual know-how\nand collective routines provide the basis for service provision to clients and as a\nknowledge-based business, the legal profession faces great challenges as lawyers\nare constantly in need of new information and knowledge: \u201cLawyers are knowledge\nworkers\u201d (Schulz and Klugmann, 2005), who have gained their knowledge\nthrough formal education and work experience (Gottschalk et al., 2005).\nTechnological advances have also played an important role in changing the pace of\nprogress, Scott and Christensen (2004) relate how international publishing firms\nsuch as Wolters Kluwer, Reed-Elsevier or Thompson have turned what Scott and\nChristensen (2004) call \u201cthe once sleepy law library\u201d into a $15 billion a year\nindustry with a tendency to grow beyond that with new products and\ntechnologies. This is just one measurable aspect of the increased investment by\nlaw firms into KM: investment figures into internal KM are mostly unknown, but\none number does underline the new emphasis placed on KM. In a study into the\nKM behaviour of European law firms, Disterer (2005) found that for every 25\nlawyers employed in a law firm in Europe, there is now on average one knowledge\nmanagement professional supporting them.\nLaw firms can be seen as early and capital intense adapters of the practices of\nknowledge management (Forstenlechner, 2005) partly due the highly knowledge\nintensive work as well as several other factors such as higher efficiency gains from\nspecialisation compared to other sectors (Scott and Christensen, 2004) or the high\nrisk involved in knowledge loss through turnover (Stovel and Bontis, 2002). Still,\nthere is little evidence about success or failure of knowledge management efforts\namong large professional service firms, even though law firms are not the only\nones investing heavily in KM (Ardichvili et al., 2003). Broady-Preston and Williams\n(2004, p. 9) emphasise that \u201cLaw is an information-intensive profession, in which\nthere has traditionally been great reliance on external information. Currently,\nhowever, greater focus is placed on internally generated information and expertise;\nin harnessing such knowledge, the legal sector exemplifies means by which\ninformation may create business value for organisations\u201d.\nKnowledge management in the professional services sector\n\u201cThe only product sold in law is intellectual capital\u201d (Chatzkel, 1999, p. 6) is not\nonly true for the legal sector but also for most other professional service firms\nsuch as consultancies or accountancies. The key to any service provided is the\ninput in the form of knowledge the organisation has received and the output it\ncan deliver based on this (Hunter et al., 2002). The growth of specialisation\nas outlined by Scott and Christensen (2004, p. 3) identifies the increasing\nneed to more efficiently deal with knowledge within professional service firms:\nThe growth of specialization means that most corporate legal work does not\ninvolve complex problem-solving. With the right experience, specialists can\neasily recognise patterns and apply familiar tools so that they do not need\nto \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d.\nPattern recognition dramatically increases efficiency. Hourly rates assume\neverything requires complex problem solving. While few industries have\nexperienced greater productivity gains from specialization, the absence of a\ncompetitive market enables law firms to hoard cost savings instead of passing\nthem along to corporations\u201d.\nKnowledge input in the form of individual know-how and collective routines\nprovide the basis for service provision to clients in a very flexible way to meet the\ndifferent needs of different clients. The professional experience needed to perform\nthis role is based on formal education as well as professional development\n(codified knowledge) and on the experience of working with clients and more\nsenior professionals (tacit knowledge). Hunter et al. (2002) suggest a high\ncorrelation between the quality of recruits and the quality of the output, which in\nturn would be reflected in the firm\u2019s reputation.\nIn the law firm sector, the most common structure of firms is a partnership, in which\nlawyers can become owners of the firm depending on their performance. Rebitzer\nand Taylor (1999) argue that this can be seen as the prize in a tournament in\nwhich the winners forego immediate returns to the value of their knowledge, in\norder to reap the gains of property rights in the firm in the longer term. Hunter et al.\n(2002) see the risk in this as the specificity of their knowledge, such as the facet that\nclose relations to a main client involve the risk that the holder of the knowledge\nmight leave the organisation and take the client with him.\nResearch methodology\nThis research builds on previous research with 12 additional interviewees added to\nthe initial 12 selected for a preliminary case study.\nThe method chosen is semi-structured interviews, allowing increased flexibility for\nthe interviews. As Wengraf (2001) defines the semi-structured interview as an\ninterview where a number of questions have been prepared in advance and the\ninterviewer is at liberty to decide during the interview which ones to use and with the\nopportunity to adapt to the responses of the interviewee. Robson (1993) describes\ninterviews as \u201ca kind of conversation; a conversation with a purpose\u201d. Yin (1989)\ndescribes variations in interview techniques from being highly structured to free range\nconversations using closed as well as open-ended questions. The authors decided\nto adhere to the principles and procedures recommended by Robson (1993) in regards\nto interview schedule, conduction and analysis. As recommended by Patton (1990),\nfollow up questions were used within the semi-structured interviews to help\nconfirm or discard underlying assumptions and issues that needed clarification. The\nconcept of theoretical saturation (Eisenhardt, 1989; Glaser and Strauss, 1967)\nguided the number of interviews conducted, which ended when little or no variation\nwas observed in the questions that did not allow free text answers.\nInterviews were conducted with the aim of gaining insight into those areas where\nKM is making a value contribution. The individuals interviewed were selected\nfrom among the Top 10 global law firms (based on Legal 500 rankings), which shared\nthe following characteristics:\n\uf0b7 comparable in size;\n\uf0b7 comparable in revenue;\n\uf0b7 geographically dispersed offices;\n\uf0b7 history of mergers that created the current organisation;\n\uf0b7 comparable client target base;\n\uf0b7 good reputation; and\n\uf0b7 publicly known KM efforts\nInterviews were recorded, typed and analysed for reuse in this research. The\ninterviews sought both qualitative and quantitative input and were analysed\naccordingly. The author approached interviews in line with Cooper and Schindler\n(1998): \u201cContent analysis is useful for measuring the semantic content or the what\naspect of a message\u201d. The resultant content was therefore analysed according to\nsubject area and responses. Questions were coded and analysed on a question by\nquestion basis and quotes were tagged for future use, and a log was kept as\nrecommended by Cooper and Schindler (1998) in addition to the general research\nlog recommended by Eisenhardt (1989). The answers to the coded questions were\nanalysed according to subject area \u2013 and where appropriate \u2013 by their numerical\nvalue and summed up.\nFindings and implications\nOverall, the benefits mentioned by interviewees were:\n\uf0b7 Efficiency: 58 per cent.\n\uf0b7 Quality: 50 per cent.\n\uf0b7 Risk management: 33 per cent.\n\uf0b7 Long term benefits: 33 per cent.\n\uf0b7 Influence on firm culture: 25 per cent.\n\uf0b7 Benefits from current awareness: 25 per cent.\n\uf0b7 Better and quicker training: 25 per cent.\nEfficiency (58 per cent)\nIn total, 58 percent of respondents mentioned efficiency as a key benefit, which\nis in line with findings by Disterer (2005), who reports knowledge reuse and the\nreduction of redundant work as key outcomes of a survey into the benefits of\nKM as well as Davenport and Probst (2001), who see the essence of KM in efficiency\nthrough synergy, increasing the initial value of knowledge to a possibly multiple\nvalue by sharing and applying it within the same organisation. Results from the\ninterviews point in the same direction, stating that complex legal work is simply\nnot feasible without KM, as discussed by interviewee E:\nIt became very important over the last years to be able to produce large\nquantities of high quality documents in very little time. A loan agreement in\nLondon has at least 100 pages. End of the line. No 100 pages, no loan\nagreement. You can\u2019t draft that over night but you will need to present it to\nthe client in the morning anyways.\nSeen in a wider context, this also supports Huang et al. (2006), who found that a\nfirm\u2019s efficiency is directly correlated with the existence of KM within that\norganisation. Silvi and Cuganesan (2006) conclude a research paper by stating that,\n\u201cLinking knowledge specificity to activities and cost provides further insights for cost\nmanagement and the resource allocation decision-making process. Doing so can\nmake effectiveness and efficiency decisions more visible and easier to evaluate\u201d.\nExplanations for efficiency 150 gains through KM found in the interviews\nincluded, but were not limited to:\n\uf0b7 the view towards availability of know-how, as it is very helpful to know that\ndocumented knowledge is available when needed;\n\uf0b7 the efficiency of well trained KM support staff is another point emerging\nfrom the interviews; and\n\uf0b7 efficiency gains that are understood as simply making the task easier while\nincurring less cost\nA key requirement for increasing efficiency was identified by interviewee E as the\nconstant feedback loop from users of know-how to those maintaining it: \u201cThe\ninternal KM system stands or falls with feedback from the lawyers applying the\nknowledge they get from the system and giving feedback on it. If errors persist, we\nhave achieved the exact opposite of what we set out to do\u201d. Interviewee D sees\nefficiency as well as quality as the two key aspects of value contribution through\nKM: \u201cThe quicker we solve complex issues and the higher the quality of these\nsolutions is , the more likely it is for the client to return and bring more business to\nthe firm. Clients are under immense pressure and this pressure is passed on to us.\nWithout KM it would be difficult to deal with the demand for shorter response times\nand higher quality at the same time\u201d.\nQuality (50 per cent)\nRobbins (2003) affirms that the benefits of KM can be significant and mentions higher\nquality of client service as a key benefit. Disterer (2005) reports standardisation as a\nkey step to increase quality as well as the exchange of good practices fostered by KM.\nMore consistent, best-in-industry service to clients builds client loyalty and supports\na firm\u2019s future client revenue stream (Rusanow, 2005) and Gottschalk et al. (2005)\nsees another benefit in today\u2019s more cost conscious environment the provision of\nhigh value services at lower cost, which can help in providing the services that clients\nare looking for. This point was also confirmed throughout the interviews, such as by\ninterviewee B:\nWhen I draft contracts for the constantly changing needs of clients, I usually\nget three or four contracts out of the know-how system that provide useful\nsuggestions for the drafting of at least some clauses. As I am mostly\ndealing with contracts concerning more than one jurisdiction it is very\nhelpful being able to have a look at contracts drafted in different offices.\nInterviewees however agreed on quality as being one of the central issues in need of\nmeasurement with two focus areas: measures for the know-how system and for KM\nstaffing. Measures suggested included:\n\uf0b7 time needed for drafting standard documents (this can be measured via the\ntime capturing systems usually in place for billing purposes);\n\uf0b7 average age of documents in the know-how system; and\n\uf0b7 fee earner participation in the review process.\nA total of 50 per cent of the interviewees argued that in terms of know-how\nsystems, usage by itself is a generally valid measure of quality. Systems holding\nlittle relevant know-how tend not be used, and this is a valid, if not wholly\nsufficient measure of quality.\nIn total, 33 percent of interviewees also suggested that experience in the client\nbusiness, (before moving into full time KM work) is a quality measure for knowledge\nmanagement Lawyers, which the author considers relevant as it certainly fosters\nunderstanding of client work among fee earners. Interviewees also suggested legal\nexperience of researchers (library staff) as a key attribute that should be measured.\nThe discussion focused mainly on the topics of quality, standardisation, the impact\nof usage and the possible indicators behind it.\nRisk management (33 per cent)\nDisterer (2005) reported risk management similar to this research, as further\ndown the scale of important contributions by KM, but still on that scale. Well-\nmaintained know-how that is constantly kept updated and refined can\nsignificantly lower the risk of providing bad advice. The more time and thought\nis invested in know-how resources, the less the potential for error. It creates a\ntool, which reduces risk, as creating documents from scratch would always\ncarry, far more potential for mistakes than reusing honed know-how. Or, as\ninterviewee E put it:\nIf you look at four different contracts on a similar transaction, you are\nhighly likely to find things in there that you either hadn\u2019t thought of yourself\nor you find them drafted in a better manner than your own.\nThe same assumption is made by interviewees for increased collaboration, as\ncollaboration means more brains working on the same task and an increased\ncoverage of combined expertise:\nWith junior associates KM can make the difference between billable and non-\nbillable hours. If an associate spends ten hours drafting a document from\nscratch or if he spends ten hours learning from existing know-how and using\nit to it\u2019s full extent, thereby creating a great new document himself, the latter\nwill more likely stand a chance of being work that can actually be billed to a\nclient\u201d (Interviewee E).\nLong term benefits (33 percent)\nStovel and Bontis (2002) researched the influence of voluntary turnover on the\nCanadian financial services industry and came to the conclusion that knowledge\nmanagement can reduce the risk posed by high potentials leaving a firm for the\ncompetition. Two kinds of long-term benefits were identified by the interviewees,\none as a differentiator from the competition, and the other the long term\ninfluence on productivity. Efficient KM can become a \u201ccredible and ownable\ndistinction\u201d (Interviewee H) for a firm to stand above the competition for\nrecruitment as well as daily operations.\nLondon (2005) quotes a partner at a major law firm giving additional long term\nreasons for KM; client demands (more prospective clients are demanding law firm KM\ndescriptions), recruitment (law school recruits are asking firms about KM\nsystems), low retention rates among lawyers (as lateral hires increase, the\nbrain drain can be enormous) and insurance (liability insurers may require\ndocumentation of law firm KM systems).\nInfluence on firm culture (25 per cent)\nCultural change can be an enabler as well as a result of KM, and while several\nresearchers have discussed the enabling aspect of KM (Schulz and Klugmann (2005),\nRusanow (2005), Disterer (2005) and Chourides et al. (2003) and have identified\nseveral pre-requisites for the successful introduction of KM, the interviewees mostly\nfocussed on aspects where KM can bring about positive cultural change\nimproving firm performance. Three main aspects were identified by\ninterviewees: Fostering of collaboration, better consistency and the notion of\nglobal law firms being \u201cone firm\u201d.\nCollaboration can be improved and therefore knowledge harvested more effectively\nby talking informally to colleagues and asking for advice, which helps to establish\nrelationships among people, especially when it comes to collaboration across\nbusiness units and national borders. Interviewee K sees collaboration from the\ndrafting stage of documents onwards as a key benefit:\nI have submitted a not entirely ready clause for discussion and I received\nnot only suggestions for improvement, but also positive feedback for the\nbasic work I had done and that others could reuse. It helps me getting\nrecognition of my knowledge in the field and furthers my career.\nConsistency is seen as being achievable through the reuse of high quality\nstandard forms ensures a common approach across a firm and helps in setting the\nlevel for consistent advice to clients. Know how documents can allow new joiners to\nquickly familiarise themselves with the \u201chouse style\u201d of documents and \u201cthe way we\ndo things around here\u201d as Deal and Kennedy (1982), p. 4) define culture.\nIn today\u2019s global environment, the two points mentioned above make it easier to live\nup to the idea of being one firm, rather than a multitude of dispersed, loosely\nconnected people across many countries. KM can play a significant role in fostering\na common culture and the feeling of a collective effort across offices and\nnationalities.\nCurrent awareness (25 per cent)\nPractice specific newsletters were seen as a key contribution of KM as they save a\nconsiderable amount of time, which can be explained by a simple calculation: if a\nKML is working for a group of 25 lawyers and keeps them updated on legal news\nrelevant to their practice, this will save every single one of the 25 lawyers the time to\nlook up these changes themselves. At the same time, the KML researching these\nnewsletters will become more efficient at finding the relevant material and\nrecognising what is relevant and what is not.\nTraining (25 per cent)\nHigher quality know-how makes it easier for junior fee earners to learn and\ndevelop their skills. This point was also confirmed throughout the interviews, such\nas by interviewee F: \u201cWhen you are new to a firm there is a lot you can learn by\njust browsing through know-how. I learned a lot this way\u201d. Delegating work to junior\nstaff allows partners and senior lawyers to concentrate on high quality work and\ncharge premium rates (Rusanow, 2005). If knowledge is made available, it is\neasier for more junior lawyers to do higher value work. This point was also confirmed\nthroughout the interviews. The billing rates of lawyers are usually determined by\ntheir value to clients and their experience. If they can be developed quicker and\nbecome more valuable in a shorter time, their billing rate can increase.\nObservations and conclusions\nSome of the issues identified in the interview process were by no means\nexpected by the authors of this study, such as interviewee J explaining why some\nlawyers do not need KM at all:\nWe have two types of lawyers, one type goes into a business, solves\nproblems, and gets out having done good legal work. The second type,\nbringing in just the same amount of fees or probably even more are what I\nconsider to be therapists. They develop relationships with the clients that are\nmore like those of business consultants and therapists for CEOs who want to\nhave top lawyers around for board meetings and playing golf. Of course the\nlatter do not need KM to the same extent the problem solvers do and do not\nwish to pay for it. They need great tailors and subscriptions to lifestyle\nmagazines. But they form a surprisingly big part of the organisation.\nThis is of course an audience that the average knowledge management\nprogramme cannot cater for.\nAnother aspect found with several interviewees was the aspect of KM becoming\nimportant in terms of choosing the law firm to work for, something that was also\nmentioned by London (2005) and \u2013 in this case \u2013 supported by interviewee K:\nIt is the old saying, you never know what you have until it is gone. I used to\ndraw a lot of my work from our know-how database, which was kind of difficult\nto use but still time efficient compared to redrafting entire contracts. When I\nstarted my new role, I realised there was nothing much available KM wise and\nI had a horrible first six months building myself a basic portfolio of standard\nforms for reuse.\nYet another interviewee was very frustrated with the culture in his new firm:\nIt simply annoys me, not having access to the know-how I need while\nknowing it sits on a shelf next door, which is just as inaccessible for me as for\nany lawyer from working for the competition. I was na\u00efve and one thing I\nknow for sure is that my next job interview will include a look at their know-\nhow system. Here I was called a communist by a partner I was talking to\nabout knowledge sharing.\nKnowledge management in a law firm is a \u201cpermanent construction site\u201d (Interviewee\nL) and has yet to be defined in terms of scope and purpose in many law firms.\nWhile it means different things to different people the benefits can be identified by\nboth the customers or users of KM \u2013 although the definition differs from firm to firm\nwhether a lawyer is a customer of the KM function or a user of KM services\nprovided. These customers or users have clear expectations and a concise idea of\nbenefits KM should provide. While previous research has focussed on the perception\nof KM staff (Disterer, 2005) or the creation of a KM service line from scratch\n(Rusanow, 2005) the expectations of customers or users need to be taken into\naccount when \u201cdoing KM\u201d in a law firm.\nThis paper purposely avoids discussing the value contribution in monetary terms,\nas this needs to be a separate step in the process of quantifying value\ncontribution in the language universally spoken by law firm owners and managers\n\u2013 money. Instead, this paper focuses on anecdotal evidence presenting results in\nsubject areas with a high likelihood of influencing financial performance, such as\nefficiency or quality of work.\nThis series of interviews further confirms the validity of the assumption that KM\ncontributes value in those areas outlined on the previous pages.\nReferences\nArdichvili, A., Page, V. and Wentling, T.
