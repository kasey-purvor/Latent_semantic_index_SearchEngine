An isolated region of energetic electron precipi-\ntation observed near local noon in the auroral zone has\nbeen investigated using imaging riometer (IRIS) and inco-\nherent-scatter radar (EISCAT) techniques. IRIS revealed\nthat the absorption event was essentially co-rotating with\nthe Earth for about 2 h. The spatial and temporal vari-\nations in D-region electron density seen by EISCAT were\nable to be interpreted within a proper context when com-\npared with the IRIS data. EISCAT detected significant\nincreases in electron density at altitudes as low as 65 km\nas the event drifted through the radar beam. The altitude\ndistribution of incremental radio absorption revealed that\nmore than half of the absorption occurred below 75 km,\nwith a maximum of 67 km. The energy spectrum of the\nprecipitating electrons was highly uniform throughout the\nevent, and could be described analytically by the sum of\nthree exponential distributions with characteristic ener-\ngies of 6, 70 and 250 keV. A profile of effective recombina-\ntion coefficient that resulted in self-consistent agreement\nbetween observed electron desities and those inferred from\nan inversion procedure has been deduced. The observa-\ntions suggest a co-rotating magnetospheric source region\non closed dayside field lines. However, a mechanism is\nrequired that can sustain such hard precipitation for the\nrelatively long duration of the event.\n1 Introduction\nObservations of the high-latitude D region using the EIS-\nCAT incoherent-scatter radar facility have been gathered\nfor more than a decade now. Some of the earliest experi-\nments pioneered the measurement of backscattered\nspectra from the mesosphere (Kofman et al., 1984). This\ntechnique is now routinely applied, in a more refined form,\nin one of EISCAT\u2019s common programmes, CP-6 (T.\nTurunen, 1986), with which a data base of synoptic obser-\nvations has been accumulated since 1990. All six of the\npresent common programmes also provide a monitor of\nD-region electron density from power profile measure-\nments. The sensitivity and height resolution of the applied\npulse schemes vary from programme to programme, but\nare generally adequate for detailed D-region studies\n(Collis et al., 1986a). Special programmes devoting an\neven higher proportion of the radar duty cycle to probing\nthe D region have also been developed and valuable data\nobtained (e.g. Ranta et al., 1985; Devlin et al., 1986).\nMost of the early EISCAT D-region studies (as well as\ncountless other auroral investigations) have included\nriometer observations as a qualitative indicator of geo-\nphysical activity. Several of the EISCAT studies have\ncompared the radio absorption observed by wide-beam\nriometers with that calculated from the radar measure-\nments of D-region electron density. In many cases the\nobserved and predicted values have been close (Ranta\net al., 1985; Hargreaves and Devlin, 1990). Some examples,\nhowever, predict radio absorption from the EISCAT\nmeasurements to be greater than observed by riometer.\nThis has lead to the assumption that the structure seen by\nthe radar sometimes only fills part of the riometer antenna\nbeam (Collis et al., 1986a; Burns et al., 1990). The radar\nbeam is of the order of 1 km wide at D-region heights,\nwhereas a standard riometer antenna subtends almost\n100 km.\nThe radar allows narrow-beam observations with time\nresolutions of a few seconds and altitude resolutions of the\norder of 1 km. However, any interpretation of the\nmeasurements is subject to differentiating between tem-\nporal variations of a structure within the beam, and the\nmovement of a feature through the beam \u2014 the classical\nspatial\/temporal ambiguity of single-beam-radar experi-\nments. A new instrument that provides information to\nhelp resolve this ambiguity, by mapping the extent of\nregions of energetic particle precipitation and their dy-\nnamical development, has recently been installed in north-\nFig. 1. Locations of the EISCAT sites and of the IRIS at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\n(filled diamonds). The broken lines indicate the 3-dB projections of\nthe individual IRIS beams at 90-km altitude. The heavy oblique line\nrepresents the Norwegian coastline\nern Scandinavia. This is a 49-beam imaging riometer\n(IRIS), located at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland, some 83 km from\nthe EISCAT transmitter site (Hargreaves et al., 1996). The\nIRIS beam pattern encompasses the EISCAT location,\nthereby offering the opportunity of direct comparisons\nbetween the two data sets.\nWe anticipate a range of studies using joint EISCAT\nand IRIS data (Collis and Hargreaves, 1996). These are\nlikely to include significant contributions to (a) geophysi-\ncal investigations based on, for example, rocket, satellite\nor ground-based campaigns, where the radar data will be\nable to be set firmly within the context of the spatial\ndistributions of energetic particle precipitation, (b) synop-\ntic studies relating radio absorption to D-region electron\ndensity, by virtue of the narrow IRIS beam widths, and\n(c) detailed case-studies based principally on EISCAT\nand IRIS data alone.\nIn the present paper we introduce the first of our\ncase-studies. This was a relatively weak, featureless day-\ntime absorption event as measured by broad-beam\nriometer, but which turned out to have many interesting\ncharacteristics when studied with IRIS and EISCAT data\ntogether.\n2 The EISCAT radar system and the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS\nGeneral descriptions of the EISCAT facility have been\ngiven by Folkestad et al. (1983), Baron (1984) and Rish-\nbeth and van Eyken (1993), to which we refer readers for\ntechnical information. The EISCAT transmitters are\nlocated at Ramfjordmoen, near Troms\u00f8, Norway\n(69.59\u00b0N, 19.23\u00b0E) at an L value of 6.2. Receivers are sited\nat Ramfjordmoen itself, and for the UHF system also at\nKiruna in Sweden (67.86\u00b0N, 20.43\u00b0E, L\"5.4) and Sodan-\nkyla\u00a8 in Finland (67.36\u00b0N, 26.63\u00b0E, L\"5.05). Geomag-\nnetic data from observatories close to the EISCAT sites\nhave also been used in this work.\nThe Kilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS (an acronym for Imaging\nRiometer for Ionospheric Studies) measures the absorp-\ntion of cosmic radio noise at 38.2 MHz in 49 beam direc-\ntions. These form an approximately square 7]7 array of\nside &240 km, centred on Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (Hargreaves et al.,\n1996). Details of the implementation of the method have\nbeen described by Detrick and Rosenberg (1990). The\nbeam pattern is shown in relation to the locations of the\nEISCAT sites in Fig. 1. The central axes of the array are\naligned along the geographic N-S and E-W directions.\nIndividual beams are identified in this paper by a pair of\nnumbers (r, c), where r is the row number relative to the\ncentral (zenith-pointing) beam, positive north, and c is the\ncolumn number relative to the central beam, positive east.\nThe central beam is thus (0, 0) and r and c fall in the range\n!3 to #3 for the 49-beam array. For example, the beam\nin the extreme south-west corner is (!3,!3) and the\ncentral one in the eastmost column is (0, 3). The geo-\ngraphic co-ordinates of Kilpisja\u00a8rvi are 69.05\u00b0N, 20.79\u00b0E at\nan L value of 5.9, though the meridional extent of the\narray\u2019s field of view reaches about $0.4 L from Kilpis-\nja\u00a8rvi. Within this area, the data can be used to form\nimages of the horizontal extent of radio absorption, and\nhence of the regions of energetic particle precipitation.\nThe basic time resolution of 1 s allows the dynamics of the\nabsorption regions to be mapped in considerable detail if\nnecessary, but in practice some time averaging is normally\napplied.\n3 Observations\nThe event studied here occurred near local noon on\n1 March 1995 (local time is one hour later than Univer-\nsal Time, UT, in Scandinavia; local magnetic noon is\n&0930 UT). The geomagnetic conditions were consider-\nably disturbed on a global scale for the interval 09\u201412 UT\n(K\np\n\"6!); the local K values were rather less than this,\nhowever, being 4 at both Kiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8.\nGeomagnetic data from high-latitude stations in the mid-\nnight sector were inspected for this interval (not shown\nhere). These indicated typical auroral substorm activity,\nwith deviations of the order of 500\u2014600 nT in the horizon-\ntal component. The preceding 72 h were also disturbed\nthroughout, before which there had been a sequence of\nvery quiet days.\nMeasurements of radio absorption from both the\nbroad-beam riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi and the (1, !2) IRIS\nbeam (i.e. the one closest to the D-region intersection of\nthe field-aligned EISCAT radar beam) for the whole of\n1 March are displayed in Fig. 2. These show features that\nmay be considered characteristic of the diurnal variation\nof auroral absorption on disturbed days: relatively slow\nvarying events in the morning sector (though with addi-\ntional rapid variations on this day), an absence of activity\nin the afternoon sector, and more dynamic variations in\nthe evening and midnight sectors. (Exceptions to this\ngeneral pattern can always be found, of course.)\nThe EISCAT UHF radar was operating experiment\nCP-1 throughout 1 March. CP-1 makes continuous\nmeasurements along the geomagnetic-field direction from\n1306 P. N. Collis et al.: A localised co-rotating auroral absorption event observed near noon using IRIS and EISCAT\nFig. 2a\u2013f. Overview of geophysical activity on 1 March 1995. From\ntop to bottom are displayed: a electron density at 68-km altitude\nmeasured by EISCAT, b radio absorption from IRIS beam (1,!2),\nc radio absorption from the broad-beam riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi,\nd geomagnetic H component from Troms\u00f8, e northward compo-\nnent of ion drift velocity at 278-km altitude measured by EISCAT,\nf eastward component of ion drift velocity at 278-km altitude meas-\nured by EISCAT\nTroms\u00f8. The interesting properties of CP-1 for this study\nare electron density measurements above 62-km altitude\nwith 3-km resolution, and continuous electric-field esti-\nmates from tristatic data. The basic time resolution is 5 s,\nthough some averaging is normally performed, especially\nfor the electric-field determinations. Standard ionospheric\nparameters are also available for the E region and lower\nF region from an alternating code pulse scheme, and for\nthe F region from a long-pulse modulation. We examined\nthe E-region and F-region scalar quantities from EISCAT\nto see whether any particular features were observed that\nwould aid interpretation of the conditions surrounding\nthe absorption event. However, none were found, and we\nwill confine our interest in the EISCAT data to D-region\nelectron densities and F-region vector ion velocities.\nA survey plot of the electron density at an altitude of\n68 km is included in Fig. 2. Electrons need to have\nenergies of more than 150 keV to reach this altitude. The\nelectron-density data in Fig. 2 indicate that there were\nseveral brief, hard intensifications in the morning sector,\nthough these are not considered unusual. Most striking\nis the period between 1200 and 1230 UT, when the elec-\ntron densities at 68 km reached their highest values for\nthis day. The riometer data show a smoothly varying\nabsorption event with a maximum value of about 1.5 dB\nat this time. This is the event we shall investigate in detail\nhere.\nAlso included in Fig. 2 are the horizontal ion drift\nvelocity components measured by EISCAT. We will pres-\nent the results from the period of the absorption event\nitself in more detail later. However, we note in passing that\nthere is no apparent correlation between \u2018activity\u2019 as mea-\nsured by radio absorption and ion drift velocity. In other\nwords, the occurrence of energetic particle precipitation\nappears to have no relation to the convection electric-field\nintensity, at least on this day.\nThe IRIS data from all 49 beams are displayed for the\nnoon-time event in Fig. 3. These values of radio absorp-\ntion constitute the raw information from which two-di-\nmensional absorption images can be constructed (see e.g.\nFigs. 6 and 7 later). Some preprocessing has already been\nperformed to obtain the absorption values. The observed\nradio-noise power levels are referred to the estimated\nquiet-day values in order to calculate the absorption, and\nsome time averaging of the basic 1-s data has been em-\nployed. Figure 3 also serves to illustrate the overall quality\nof the data from IRIS. This is generally good, especially\nwith longer integration times such as the 30 s used here.\nHowever, F-region irregularities occasionally cause scin-\ntillations when either of the radio sources Cygnus-A or\nCassiopeia-A traverses one of the IRIS beams. Scintilla-\ntions, amounting to $0.3 dB at most, can be seen in the\n(!1,!2) and (!1, 0) beams in Fig. 3 (also apparent\nbetween 15 and 19 UT in Fig. 2b). These effects are pre-\ndictable and well known, and affected data can be rejected\nbefore further analysis.\nA more detailed view of the absorption event as seen by\nfour of the IRIS beams at the EISCAT longitude is shown\nin Fig. 4. A clear north-to-south motion is apparent.\nComplete images of the event (Fig. 5a) show that it was\nspatially confined, particularly in the N-S direction with\na half-width considerably less than 100 km. The images\nalso reveal a gradual equatorward and westward motion\nrelative to Kilpisja\u00a8rvi. However, the time-span of the\nimages covers more than 2 h, during which time the Earth\nP. N.

Each profile is a 1-min\naverage\nrotated by 30\u00b0 of longitude. Thus the absorption event\nwas effectively co-rotating with the Earth.\nIn forming images of the horizontal distribution of\nradio absorption, the observations from the 49 beams are\nassumed to be spot measurements at the centre of each\nbeam, at a fixed height. The width of the zenithal (0, 0)\nbeam is &20 km to the 3-dB points. The oblique beams\nbecome increasingly larger than this with decreasing elev-\nation, especially in the radial direction (Fig. 1). Thus, if\nthere are spatial gradients in absorption, for example at\nthe edge of a feature, the response of IRIS may be slightly\ndifferent from the real distribution of absorption. A model\nhas been developed to investigate this effect, by convol-\nving a theoretical distribution of absorption with the\nantenna patterns of the individual beams. The Appendix\nshows the results of modelling a latitudinally confined\nstrip of absorption with a Gaussian cross-section, i.e. of\nsimilar shape to the present event. The calculations indi-\ncate that most of the beams will record at least 90% of the\ntrue absorption if the width of the absorption region is\nmore than 25 km. For two further beams this width would\nhave to be 50 and 70 km, respectively. The results also\ndemonstrate quantitatively the poor performance of the\nextreme corner beams, which are anyway routinely ex-\ncluded when forming images from the data. Thus for the\npresent event on 1 March, which was imaged by the\nnarrowest IRIS beams near the zenith, the implication is\nthat the derived spatial distribution of absorption should\nbe accurate at the 90% level if the width was 25 km or\nmore.\nThe location of the EISCAT beam at 90-km altitude is\napproximately midway between the centre and the top-left\n1308 P.

The radar thus captured a time-slice through the\nwestern edge of this feature, between 1200 and 1230 UT.\nTwo contour plots of the absorption observed by IRIS are\nshown in Fig. 6, where the location of the EISCAT beam\nat 90-km altitude is also marked. The first of these, from\n1204 UT, was when EISCAT recorded the largest D-re-\ngion electron densities during the event. The second, from\n1240 UT, was when the feature had become weaker,\nand was located equatorward of EISCAT and Kilpisja\u00a8rvi.\nWe will later show results from EISCAT that indicate that\nthe majority of the absorption in this event occurred\ncloser to 70-km altitude than the (commonly assumed)\n90-km level. The distances in Figs. 5a and 6 should there-\nfore be scaled from the origin by a factor 7\/9.\nThe electron densities measured by the radar during\nthis event are displayed in Fig. 5b. We mentioned earlier,\nin connection with the electron density time-series in Fig.\n2, that this event was significantly harder (in terms of\nprecipitating electron energy spectra) than any other on\nthis day. At the peak of the event, an electron density in\nexcess of 1010 m~3 was registered to 65-km altitude. It is\nrare that radar experiments detect any signal at these\nheights during electron precipitation events. We attribute\nthis ionisation to energetic electrons because no evidence\nof energetic protons was seen by particle detectors on\nGOES-7 at geostationary orbit (data made available by\nSpace Environment Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, USA).\nSample profiles of electron density from before, during\nand after the event are shown in Fig. 7. The values before\n(1120 UT) and after (1259 UT) the event are essentially the\nsame and represent the undisturbed ionosphere resulting\nfrom photoionisation. The profile at 1204 UT has the\nlargest densities seen by the radar during this event, just\nafter the structure entered the beam. The profile at\n1223 UT is just before the structure left the beam. Note\nthat these two profiles are very similar in shape, indicating\nthat the energy spectrum of the precipitating electrons\nremained constant through the event, with just the num-\nber fluxes changing.\n1310 P.

Also included are\nthe modelled profiles (broken lines with crosses)\nThe observed movement of the absorption feature will\nbe investigated in the analysis section below, where the\nEISCAT F-region ion-velocity measurements will be in-\ntroduced in more detail. First, we will begin by consider-\ning the nature of the D-region disturbance itself.\n4 Analysis\n4.1 Electron densities and effective recombination\ncoefficients\nFor the event in question, ionisation produced by precipi-\ntating electrons was evident only below about 115-km\naltitude (Fig. 7), indicating the virtual absence of particles\nwith energies less than a few keV. We have investigated\nthe ionospheric effects and the implied energy spectra of\nthe precipitating electrons using the ZABMOD method of\ninverting the observed electron-density profile described\nby Hargreaves and Devlin (1990).\nFor daytime events, a necessary first step in the inver-\nsion process is to remove the photoionised component\nfrom the observed electron densities. As the production\nrates due to the photoionisation and particles are additive,\nwe need to work with the squares of the electron densities,\ni.e. the electron densities due to particles alone at any\nheight are given by (N2\nT\n!N2\nph\n)0.5, where N\nT\nis the total\nelectron density and N\nph\nis the component due to photo-\nionisation. For the present isolated event, this could be\nachieved by using one of the quiet profiles obtained when\nthe event was not in the radar beam. This resulted in\nprofiles of particle-produced densities at 1204 and\n1223 UT as shown in Fig. 8. These values were then used\nas inputs to the inversion routine. The routine converges\niteratively towards an electron flux-energy spectrum that\nproduces an electron density profile matching the ob-\nserved one to within a predefined tolerance (typically\nseveral per cent). Model values are required for several\nparameters used by the algorithm and the results depend\nupon the choice of these.\nThe most poorly known quantity used by ZABMOD is\nthe profile of effective recombination coefficient (a\n%&&\n). This\nis a useful parameter for studies of ionisation balance in\nthe lower ionosphere, but is only a quantitative indicator\nof the underlying ion chemistry. Consider the general\ncharge continuity equation for a plasma:\ndN\ne\n\/dt\"q!\u201a!\u201e, (1)\nwhere dN\ne\n\/dt is the time rate of change of electron density,\nq is the ion pair production rate, \u201a is electron loss rate by\nrecombination and \u201e represents transport losses. For the\nD region, we neglect \u201e due to ion-neutral collisions. With\nthe implicit assumption that the ionosphere consists of\none positive and one negative ion species, or can be\ndescribed by single ionisable species, Eq. 1 becomes\n(Banks and Kockarts, 1973):\ndN\ne\n\/dt\"q\/(1#j)!(a\n$\n#ja\n*\n)N2\ne\n!N\ne\ndj\/ (1#j)dt, (2)\nwhere j is the number density ratio of negative ions to\nelectrons, a\n$\nis the ion-electron recombination coefficient\nand a\n*\nis the ion-ion recombination coefficient. For dy-\nnamic conditions the dN\ne\n\/dt term needs to be retained,\nbut for steady-state conditions, such as the event in ques-\ntion, dN\ne\n\/dt\"0 and we obtain:\nq\"(1#j) (a\n$\n#ja\n*\n)N2\ne\n\"a\n%&&\nN2\ne\n.

In the limiting case of negligible negative ion\ndensities (which is probably never attained in reality in the\nlower D region), a\n%&&\nis just a\n$\n. More rigorous treatment,\ninvolving detailed ion-chemical models (Burns et al., 1991;\nE. Turunen, 1993, 1996), is outside the scope of the present\nstudy. However, the experimental approach used here\nallows limits to be set on a\n%&&\nthat could be used as\nboundary conditions in model studies.\nThe effective recombination coefficient at a given\nheight is quite variable, but a standard approach is to use\nan average model representative of the prevailing condi-\ntions. Gledhill (1986) deduced analytical a\n%&&\nprofiles from\na consideration of available values reported in the litera-\nture, classified according to the type of geophysical event\nand separated by day and night. Unfortunately, for the\npresent purposes, there were not enough results for day-\ntime auroral events (i.e. of the type in this case-study) to\nallow the derivation of a representative profile. The cat-\negory of conditions resembling most closely those of the\npresent event, for which Gledhill (1986) presented an ana-\nlytical profile, is the collection for daytime polar-cap\nabsorption, sudden phase anomalies, solar proton events\nand solar flares. For these he deduced a\n%&&\n\"\n0.501 exp(!0.165 h), where h is the altitude in km, ap-\nplying over the altitude range 50\u201490 km (Fig. 9).\nThe number of values at higher altitudes did not allow\nP.

The dotted line is the extension of the Gledhill (1986) a\n%&&\nprofile to higher altitudes mentioned in the text\na significant fit to the data. Moreover, the spread of\nreported results was large (at least two to three orders of\nmagnitude) at any height over the valid altitude range.\nThe inversion algorithm presently accommodates the\naltitude range 65\u2014110 km. We initially applied the above\nanalytical expression for a\n%&&\nover this whole height-range.\nThe observed steep decrease in electron density above\n90 km (Fig. 8) could not be reproduced, indicating that the\nextrapolated a\n%&&\ncoefficients there were too small. In a sec-\nond attempt the analytical values were used only for the\nvalid range, 65\u201490 km, and the value at 90 km was as-\nsumed to apply at higher altitudes also. The resultant\n\u2018\u2018modelled\u2019\u2019 electron density profile (i.e. the values pre-\ndicted from the electron flux-energy spectrum resulting\nfrom the inversion of the observed electron density profile)\nmatched the observations well at all heights, except near\nthe peak at 85\u201495-km altitude (where they were too large).\nThe a\n%&&\nprofile was then adjusted to use the analytical\ncurve only up to 85 km, and to be constant above that\nheight. An inversion using that profile produced densities\nat the peak that were smaller than the observed ones. This\nsuggests that the most realistic a\n%&&\nprofile should follow\nthe analytical curve up to some height between 85 and\n90 km, and to be constant at higher altitudes. Figure\n9 displays the a\n%&&\nprofile that we finally arrived at (i.e. that\nwhich produced a good fit to the observed densities at all\nheights). The resultant electron density profiles are shown,\ntogether with the observed values, in Fig. 8.\nThe empirical profile of effective recombination coeffi-\ncient resulting from our analysis is strictly valid only for\nthe conditions of the event in question. This quantity is\nexpected to depend on a number of factors affecting the\nion chemistry, for example the neutral atmosphere density\nand temperature, the solar zenith angle, and perhaps the\nion production rate (suggesting that a\n%&&\nmay even vary\nduring a single event). The ionosphere was sunlit for the\npresent event, implying rather small number densities of\nnegative ions (they are easily photodissociated) and\na\n%&&\nshould approximate a\n$\nas mentioned earlier. At\nnight however, more negative ions are expected, thereby\nincreasing a\n%&&\n. Similar studies of further events will be\nuseful for the investigation of possible variations of a\n%&&\nand the implications for ion chemistry.\nThe close agreement of the observed and modelled\nelectron densities indicates that ZABMOD is at least\nself-consistent. However, it should be remembered that\nsome of the atmospheric model parameters could produce\neffects that tend to cancel each other in the inversion\nprocedure, e.g. too-high neutral densities will increase the\nelectron density, while too-high a\n%&&\nwill decrease it. Thus\nthe results cannot be said to validate the model assump-\ntions, but they are not inconsistent with the models being\na good representation of the true conditions.\n4.2 Flux-energy spectra of precipitating electrons\nThe electron density profiles during the passage of this\nevent through the radar beam did not change much in\noverall shape (though the absolute values did change with\ntime). As the characteristics of the absorption structure\nobserved by IRIS were rather uniform both before and\nafter it passed through the radar beam, it seems reason-\nable to speculate that the density profiles were relatively\nuniform in shape for a considerable time. The implication\nthat the energy spectral distribution of the precipitating\nelectrons was rather constant is borne out by the results of\nthe inversion procedure (Fig. 10) for the two electron\ndensity profiles considered earlier.\nThe spectra in Fig. 10 have been fitted with the sum of\nthree exponential distributions:\ndJ\/dE\"C[2 \u00b7 105 exp(!E\/6)#105 exp(!E\/70)\n#2.5 \u00b7 103 exp(!E\/250)],\nwhere E is the energy in keV and C is a constant (equal to\nunity for the 1223-UT spectrum and 1.9 for 1204 UT).\nThis distribution, indicated by the broken lines in Fig. 10,\nis an almost exact fit for 1223 UT, but the 1204-UT\nspectrum shows slightly more irregular variation with\nenergy. The characteristic energies (E\n0\n) of 6, 70 and\n250 keV can be contrasted with the results of a similar\ninversion procedure on morning-sector absorption events\nby Hargreaves and Devlin (1990). In that study, a max-\nimum value of 22 keV was reported for E\n0\n, though typical\nvalues were significantly smaller than this. Collis et al.\n(1986b) presented a synthesis of trapped electron spectra\nat synchronous orbit from five morning-sector events.\nThose results were well described by an exponential distri-\nbution with E\n0\n&30\u201435 keV, but also equally well by\na power law varying as E~3.7 for energies \u201960 keV.\nSatellite data were also presented for another morning-\nsector event by Collis and Korth (1985). A basic power-\nlaw distribution (E~2.74) was again found for the trapped\nelectrons, but with a superposed drifting component at the\ntime of the absorption event itself.\nThe distributions for the present event follow neither\na single exponential nor a power law; they are much\nharder than for other reported morning-sector events\nsuch as those mentioned above. This latter observation is\nconsistent with the findings of Collis et al. (1984), who\n1312 P. N.

This results in a profile of incremental\nabsorption, which provides the total absorption when\nintegrated over height. Figure 9 shows the specific absorp-\ntion profile used for the 1 March calculations. For the\n1204-UT electron density profile we obtained a total ab-\nsorption of 2.5 dB. This is to be compared with the max-\nimum value of &1.8 dB observed in the (1,!2) IRIS\nbeam close to EISCAT.\nThe profile of incremental absorption for the peak of\nthe event is shown in Fig. 11. This is weighted very much\nto the lower altitudes, with a maximum at 67 km and 50%\nof the total absorption occurring below 73 km. In con-\ntrast, morning-sector events typically have maxima in the\n80\u201490-km-altitude region (Hargreaves and Devlin, 1990).\nA comparision of the radio absorption predicted from\nthe EISCAT electron density measurements with that\nobserved in two nearby IRIS beams is shown in Fig. 12.\nThe longitude of the field-aligned EISCAT D-region\nmeasurements coincides with column !2 of the IRIS\narray. In latitude, however, the radar beam falls about\nmidway between IRIS beams (2,!2) and (1,!2). Figure\n12 shows the results for these two beams on either side of\nthe EISCAT values. The equatorward motion is again\nclear (cf. Fig. 4), but the absorption calculated from the\nEISCAT densities shows more temporal variation than\nthe IRIS results. Thus, although the main absorption\nfeature was spatially confined, particularly in latitude, the\nEISCAT measurements suggest the additional presence of\nvariations with a scale size significantly smaller than an\nIRIS beam (&20 km). Such variations would be smoothed\nout by the spatial integration of the IRIS measurements.\nThe geometry of this experiment was not well suited for\na detailed comparison of calculated and observed absorp-\ntion because the radar beam was not co-located with any\nparticular IRIS beam. Future studies of the spatial sizes of\nP. N. Collis et al.: A localised co-rotating auroral absorption event observed near noon using IRIS and EISCAT 1313\nFig. 13. Zonal and meridional components of F-region ion drifts\nfrom EISCAT ( full lines) and drifts of the absorption event from\nIRIS (symbols)\nprecipitation regions using EISCAT and IRIS should ob-\nviously use co-located observations.\n4.4 Motion and co-rotation of the absorption event\nAlthough the absorption region drifted slowly equator-\nwards and westwards with respect to Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, the fact\nthat it underwent relatively little displacement while re-\nmaining within the IRIS field of view for more than 2 h\nindicates that it was actually co-rotating with the Earth.\nWe consider first the motion with respect to the Earth\nand compare this with the information on elec-\ntrodynamics available from the radar, i.e. F-region ion\nvector velocities (equivalent to ionospheric electric field).\nFigure 2 demonstrated that absorption events on 1 March\ntended to occur during periods of weak ionospheric con-\nvection. The noon-time event was no exception, with\nabsorption being detected by IRIS as the F-region ion\nvelocities fell from a few hundred m s~1 to approximately\nzero (electric fields from &20 mVm~1 down to zero).\nFigure 13 displays the meridional and zonal compo-\nnents of motion of the absorption event, determined from\nthe location of the absorption peak every 2 min, and\nF-region ion drifts estimated from 1-min averages. The\npoint-to-point variations in the EISCAT results are prob-\nably due to statistical noise, though the long-term trends\nare clear. The F-region drifts had significant west and\nnorth components some 30 min before the absorption\nevent appeared, but declined to approximately zero over\nthe subsequent hour. The westward movement of the\nabsorption structure closely matched the westward con-\nvection velocity. The meridional components did not\nagree, however, and even showed a tendency to be oppo-\nsite in direction (though the speeds were relatively small,\n&100 ms~1 or less).\nThe similar trends of the EISCAT F-region drifts and\nthe motion of the precipitation region (with a change of\nsign for the meridional component) have no obvious\ncausal relation. We are certainly not suggesting that the\nD-region density enhancement was being driven at iono-\nspheric heights by the convection electric field. Neither\ncan the movement be explained by gradient-curvature\ndrift of a trapped electron population in the magneto-\nsphere. Such motion would be eastward, energy depen-\ndent and extremely rapid for the energies present in this\nevent; the observations are the antithesis of such a mecha-\nnism.\nThat the major component of motion of the absorption\nevent was co-rotation, over a period of 2 h or so, is\nremarkable. Observations with the IRIS at South Pole\nstation (L\"13.2) revealed a somewhat similar character-\nstic for morning-sector events (Hargreaves et al., 1994).\nSeveral cases were found in which the peaks of several\nconsecutive events, over periods of 4\u20145 h, appeared at\na favoured longitude that drifted slowly and systemati-\ncally with time. It was tentatively suggested that co-rotat-\ning cold plasma enhancements near the magnetopause,\nwith precipitation generated by wave-particle interac-\ntions, could account for the observations. Whether this\nexplanation could also be applied to the present (single,\nlong-lasting) event, with a rather constant, particularly\nhard, electron energy distribution, remains speculative.\nThe source of the energetic electrons must be scattering\ninto the loss cone on closed field lines well above the\nionosphere. Assuming that the source region is far out in\nthe magnetosphere, and possibly near the equatorial\nplane, it is probably quite close to the dayside mag-\nnetopause. The noon-time period implies that the local\nfield line would be at or near its closest approach to the\nsubsolar point, especially as we expect a compressed day-\nside magnetopause in view of the prevailing disturbed\nconditions. On the other hand, the event may be related in\nsome way with the substorm activity on the rightside of\nthe Earth mentioned earlier. It is not our aim to examine\nthe detailed magnetospheric implications of this event.\nSpacecraft observations, including modelling the config-\nuration of the magnetosphere (Tsyganenko, 1995), would\nprovide important information for future investigations of\nsimilar events.\n5 Conclusions\n1. A long-lived (\u20192 h), localised (few tens of km in lati-\ntudinal extent but more extended in longitude) radio ab-\nsorption feature has been observed near local noon (post\nmagnetic noon) by the 49-beam imaging riometer at\n1314 P.

(the results would be\nslightly different for other maximum values); the 90% level is in-\ndicated. a Beams to the east; b beams to the north; c beams to the\nnorth-east\nKilpsja\u00a8rvi. Simultaneously, the EISCAT UHF radar\nmonitored the time and height variation of D-region elec-\ntron density as the absorption event passed through the\nradar beam. These two techniques revealed two major\ncharacteristics of the event; that it was co-rotating with\nthe Earth (from IRIS) and that the precipitating electrons\nwere unusually hard (from EISCAT).\n2. The inferred spectra of the precipitating electrons\ncould be approximated by the sum of three exponential\ndistributions, the high-energy tail of which had a charac-\nteristic energy of 250 keV. The shape of the electron den-\nsity profiles (and hence of the electron energy spectra) was\nrather uniform with time, though small-scale variations in\nnumber fluxes were apparent. This would suggest a rather\ninvariant source mechanism for the precipitation of the\nelectrons from the magnetosphere.\n3. Furthermore, as the precipitation region was co-\nrotating, the source region must have been almost station-\nary with respect to the closed field lines above Kilpisja\u00a8rvi.\nThese characteristics are consistent with the presence of\na cold plasma region that precipitates trapped electrons as\nthey drift into it. As the source was relatively long lived\nand probably quite close to the dayside magnetopause,\nspacecraft observations would be a valuable input to\nsimilar studies in future.\n4. The radar detected rather more temporal variabil-\nity, in terms of radio absorption predicted from the ob-\nserved electron densities, than was evident in the IRIS\nmeasurements (Fig. 12). This implies that features nar-\nrower than the individual IRIS beams (&20 km) may\nhave been present.\n5. A profile of effective recombination coefficent (a\n%&&\n)\nwas determined that predicted, self-consistently, the ob-\nserved D-region electron densities using an inversion pro-\ncedure. This a\n%&&\nprofile followed a Gledhill (1986) daytime\ncurve below 85 km but with constant values above 90 km.\nThe height of maximum radio absorption (67 km) was\nmuch lower than is normally found, and 50% of the total\nradio absorption occurred below 73-km altitude. The\nlarge electron-neutral collision frequencies (i.e. specific\nabsorption) at these low altitudes make the results parti-\ncularly sensitive to the accuracy of the electron density\nmeasurements and to the atmospheric models employed\nin the calculations.\nAppendix. Response of a 49-beam IRIS to a spatially\nlimited absorption structure\nWhen using multiple beams that emanate from a single site, the\nshape and size of each beam as it intersects the ionosphere will\ndepend on the zenith angle of the beam. Because of this variation in\nbeam shape and size, it is important to estimate how each beam\nwould respond to an absorption event of a particular spatial extent.\nIt would be expected that if an absorption structure was spatially\nlarge enough to fill a particular beam, then the absorption measured\nby the IRIS system would be close to the peak value of the event.\nHowever, if the structure was more localised, the beam would not\nrecord the full intensity of the change in signal power. As a result,\nthe IRIS response to the event would be less than the true peak\nabsorption value. In order to quantify this effect, the responses of the\nIRIS beams were modelled mathematically using Gaussian strip\nabsorption structures of varying widths.\nThe following calculations were performed for each of the 49\nbeams:\nf First, the power response of a beam in a particular direction\n(defined by the spherical co-ordinates \/ and h) was calculated\nfrom the polar response diagram for the IRIS system.\nf A Gaussian strip absorption structure was simulated using the\nequation\nA\"A\n0\nexp (!(y!y\n0\n)2\/2p2), (A1)\nwhere A\n0\nis the peak absorption value (dB), y\n0\nis the distance (km)\nof the peak of the absorption strip from the centre of the IRIS\narray, y is the distance (km) from y\n0\nand p is the half-width of the\nevent (km) at A\n0\ne~0.5 (+61%).\nf The strip was oriented east-west at 90-km altitude and y\n0\nwas\nchosen so that the absorption strip was centred on the estimated\npoint of maximum response of the beam. A peak absorption value\nof 3 dB was used in the modelling as this represents an event of\nmoderate intensity.\nf Using the above model, the IRIS power response after absorption\nwas calculated for the beam in the direction (\/, h ).\nf Power responses before absorption (P) and after absorption (P\na\n)\nwere then integrated for \/\"0\u20142n and h\"0\u2014n\/2, to give the total\npower responses over the whole sky.\nf The apparent absorption as measured by IRIS is then given by:\nA\n!11\n(dB)\"10 \u00b7 log10(P\/Pa ). (A2)\nf The absorption was corrected to an apparent zenithal value using\nthe zenith angle of the beam.\nP. N. Collis et al.: A localised co-rotating auroral absorption event observed near noon using IRIS and EISCAT 1315\nThe beams are symmetrical about the central N-S and E-W\naxes of the IRIS array. The results have therefore been plotted\nonly for the beams is one quadrant of the array. Figure 14 shows\nthe apparent zenithal absorption as a function of p for selected\nbeams, illustrating the degree to which IRIS may distort the\nmagnitude (and hence the shape) of absorption events of varying\nspatial sizes. Figure 14a shows that the response of beams (0, 0),\n(0, 1) and (0, 2) is acceptable (to 90% of A\n0\n) until the width of\nthe structure drops below about p\"20 km. For beam (0, 3) the limit\nis about p\"25 km. Figure 14b shows that as the beams elongate\nin the N\u2014S direction, they respond less to the absorption structure,\nwhich is oriented E-W. Hence, the responses of beams (2, 0) and\n(3, 0) fall to 90% of A\n0\nat around 40 km and 70 km, respectively.\nThe effect is even more marked in Fig. 14c as the beams elon-\ngate in the SE-NW direction. The response of the corner beam\n(3, 3) is seriously depressed unless the absorption is virtually\nuniform.\nIn summary, the response of most beams is depressed by no more\nthan about 10% for Gaussian strips having p525 km (equivalent\nto about 60-km full width at half the maximum absorption). Results\nindicating absorption features smaller than these should be treated\nwith caution. The response of the corner beams ($3,$3) is likely to\nbe significantly depressed in most auroral absorption events.\nAcknowledgements.
