In the first phase of \nexperimentation, defects including porosity and fractural damage induced in the \nsubsurface area were investigated. This was linked to a statistical analysis of cup \nwheel grinding conditions, which suggested previously unconsidered systematic \nmodels for the material removal process and which identified the optimum machining \nconditions required for excellent surface roughness and surface flatness with \nminimum textural damage. In verifying the suggested model, not only the grinding \nparameters but also control of the loop distance between the grinding wheel and the \nsurface of the workpiece have been considered. Contact at the material removal \ninterface was found to be of critical importance. This idea led to a design \nimprovement for the tooling structure. It was concluded that viscoelastic damping and \nrelatively soft contact at the material removal interface are beneficial in obtaining a \nfine surface finish together with a flat surface. This contrasts to previous work where \nresearchers have claimed that high static loop stiffness and high resonant frequencies\nof machine structures are essential for this purpose.\nKeywords\nFracture,  thick film, micro-actuator, damping, soft contact, loop distance\n* Manuscript\n1. Introduction \nPolycrystalline lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics are of major importance in \nmicrotechnology, particularly in the field of sensors and actuators, because of their \nsuperior piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties and their high dielectric constants \n(Setter, 2001; Uchino, 2004; Uchino, 2006; Wilson and Bowen, 2007). Devices that \nincorporate these materials as their active component include micro-pumps and \nvalves, ultrasonic motors, thermal sensors, probes for medical imaging and non-\ndestructive testing, accelerometers and quite recently a new range of electronic \ncomponents that includes filters, memory devices and switches. The materials are well \nestablished and an extensive range of compositional variations are available that can \nbe tailored to particular commercial devices. New applications continue to emerge,\nand a major research effort has been underway to address the manufacturing \ntechnology required to incorporate these materials with associated structural \ncomponents and electronic circuitry at the wafer scale. In one such study, it has \nrecently been demonstrated that micro-scale actuators can be assembled using ultra-\nprecision grinding in association with standard micro-fabrication processes such as \nwafer bonding and photolithography (Wilson et al., 2006). Such devices are suitable \nfor micro-fluidic or micro-pneumatic systems and the methods used lend themselves \nto batch production. Moreover the electromechanical properties of ultra-precision \nground PZT layers in the 20 ~ 50 micron thickness range are far superior to those \nproduced by alternative methods such as thick film deposition. Multi-layer thick PZT \nfilm devices and multi-material devices can potentially be fabricated by ultra-\nprecision machining on an industrial scale, and this has been the motivation for the \nfollowing investigation into fine surface integrity control.\nIn the field of precision machining, cutting and grinding processes are two of the most \ncommon techniques used to obtain appropriate geometry, even if the tolerance \nspecification is at the sub-micron scale. A wide variety of materials can be processed \nin this way, including brittle materials, and a great deal of emphasis has been placed\non the need to produce high surface quality. This is important, as micro-scale surface \nand sub-surface defects induced by machining can change the surface stress \ndistribution, residual or applied, leading to a deterioration in mechanical performance \nand poor fatigue behavior. Much of the published work in this area is focused on the \nmaterial-removal behavior of brittle materials at the microscopic scale. Similarly there \nis a body of work which discusses the design characterization of individual machine \ncomponents, assuming that extremely high rigidity at the material removal area is \nideal. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the significance of both of these \nfactors together and their interdependence is difficult to find. This undoubtedly \nreflects the complexity of practical material removal, especially in precision grinding.\nWith regard to the machinability of piezoelectric ceramic materials, some studies exist \nwhich evaluate damage initiation in comparison to other brittle materials (Beltrao et \nal., 1997; Tanaka and Isono, 2001). Investigations have been carried out based on \nobservations of crack propagation, leading to an evaluation of mechanical toughness\nin the sub-surface area. Importantly it has been shown in these studies that ductile \nmaterial removal can be achieved with a very small depth of cut, close to the critical \ndepth of cut, which is defined as a boundary for damage-free surface finishing at the \nsub-micron scale. However, in polycrystalline PZT ceramics it is exceptionally \ndifficult to perform ductile machining over an entire surface. This is chiefly because \nof  the characteristic ferroelastic behaviour exhibited by these materials, (whereby the \nferroelectric domain structure is reoriented by the application of an external force) \nwhich tends to cause some deterioration in the mechanical stress distribution of the \nworkpiece as it is being machined (Beltrao, 1998) . The presence of weak grain \nboundaries, occasionally because of the presence of excess lead, in commercial PZT \nceramic materials is a further contributing factor (Tanaka and Isono, 2001). \nFurthermore, it has been reported that the grinding direction has a significant \ninfluence on the variation of surface roughness and this was also associated with \nferroelasticity (Beltrao et al., 1997).\nA further critical factor in achieving an exceptionally fine quality of surface finish by\nprecision cutting and grinding, is the mechanical performance of the machine tool \ncomponents. This is directly associated with structural stability, and it influences the \nsurface integrity control performance significantly. Precision machine tools have \noften been developed (with the objective of achieving the highest material removal \nrate and dimensional accuracy in the sub-micron range) by focusing on high structural \nstiffness. Mechanical characteristics such as thermal stability, static stability and \ndynamic stability are all regarded as being important factors required to achieve \nconsistent accuracy of machine motion. In practice the totality of the system needs to \nbe taken into account as structural variations, from vibration or drifting with time, can \ndirectly affect the loop distance between the tool and the workpiece. Hence they have \na controlling influence on finished surface integrity (Inasaki, 2004).\n2. Background\nIn grinding processes, relative displacement in the loop distance, which can be \ndefined for machine tool structures as the distance between the tool and the workpiece, \nleads to a variation of the actual depth of cut. For ceramic materials this can cause \nbrittle damage such as dislocations and localized cracking on the workpiece surface\n(Zhang et al., 2003). For polycrystalline PZT ceramics the quality of the ductile \nmaterial removal mode is extremely sensitive to changes in the depth of cut from the \ncritical value, which is observed to be ~ 200-400nm (Beltrao, 1998). Essentially this \nmeans that not only the design of the machine tool, but also the design characteristics\nof the grinding wheel, the tooling components and, furthermore, the contact manner at \nthe material removal point should be controlled comprehensively, since these are all \nimportant in achieving such a fine depth of cut and consequently a ductile material \nremoval mode. With this in mind, some requirements for ductile mode precision\ngrinding of ceramics have been listed in outline below (Kanai et al., 1995).\n\u25cf High contact stiffness or high abrasive support stiffness\n\u25cf High abrasive protrusion\n\u25cf No loose abrasives\n\u25cf Controllability of random protrusion height distribution within 0.1 micrometer\nFor a more comprehensive treatment, several essential factors must be added to this \nsimplified outline. In particular the performance of the grinding wheel should be \ndiscussed with respect to: a) the geometry and concentration of active abrasive grits; \nb) the kinematics of each abrasive grit engagement, which is determined by the setup \nparameters of the process (Warnecke and Barth 1999); c) the consistency of the \nmachining environment including temperature variation at the grinding point and d) \nthe fatigue behavior of the  abrasive grits including bonding elements.\nMeanwhile, the analysis of the material removal mechanism is not particularly easy in \npractical grinding even if the machine characteristics have been considered. This is\nmainly because microscopic material removal is continuously accomplished by \nmultiple abrasive grits during grinding, and hence the finished surface only reflects \ntheir interactions. Because of this, simplified evaluations are commonly preferred.\nThese have the advantage that the microscopic material removal behaviour of single \nfine abrasive grits can be observed clearly.\nStatic indentation or quasi-static (low speed) scratching tests, with various diamond \nsingle point indenters or knife edges are typically used for the material removal \ninvestigation of brittle workpieces (Malkin and Hwang, 1996; Inasaki, 1987; Marshall \net al., 1983; Klocke and Hambucker, 1997). These methods enable the material \nremoval mechanism to be isolated from other phenomena and only damage initiation \nprocesses on the surface are revealed. Hence it is possible to evaluate the transition \nfactors between successful material removal in ductile mode and fractural damage \ninitiation in brittle mode. For instance, fundamental crack propagation phenomena are\nusually realized with static indentation methods and the continuous material removal \nmechanism with moving indentation schemes. As a result, three different crack \npropagation modes have been identified and categorized, which are called median, \nlateral and radial cracks. It has also been understood from careful microscopic \ninvestigations that generation of plastically deformed areas and continuous stress \nrelease phenomena in the subsurface of a workpiece under the indented points are the \nmajor source of these cracks (Inasaki, 1987). When various PZT ceramics are \ninspected, however, these archetypal modes are not clearly observed and it has been \nclaimed that this tendency is associated with the polycrystalline texture, existence of \nporosity and domain-switching effects (Fan et al., 1993). In practice, the\nheterogeneities and structural damage initiated in the surface and subsurface area of \nPZT ceramics, show features such as dislocations, voids, micro cracks, grain pull outs, \ninterfacial failure of grains and redistribution of residual stresses. Since these can \neasily reduce the fracture toughness of the workpiece and shorten operational lifetime \nthrough reduced fatigue resistance, it can be stated that the mechanical performance \ncharacteristics of PZT ceramics are not easy to control  (Corbett, 2001).\nWith respect to a general environmental control strategy in practical grinding, the \ninfluence of lubrication has been investigated by scratching tests for advanced \nceramics (Desa and Bahadur, 1999). Studies showed that the highest material removal \nrates were achieved in dry conditions, and this was associated with maximal sub-\nsurface damage. Lower removal rates were observed in water-lubricated conditions \nand this also resulted in reduced surface strength. Both effects seems to be explained \nby formation of a hydrated oxide layer on the surface, leading to the notion that \nchemical reactions might also be significant factors when grinding ceramics. It has \nbeen suggested that mechano-chemical or electro-chemical reactions are key \nconsiderations for achieving mirror-quality or super-finished surfaces without\nsecondary textural defects inside the workpiece materials (Editorial Office of Tool \nEngineers, 1990; Encyclopedia of New Machining Tools, 1991; Bifano et al., 1988).\nElectro-active ceramics such as PZT exhibit some highly complex dynamic \nmechanical behaviour at the micro-scale. There is some variability associated with\ndifferent material compositions, meaning that not all commercial grades are \nmachinable in the same manner and typically there are also some physical \ninconsistencies such as porosity and dislocations (Beltrao, 1998). However, it can be \ngenerally summarized that PZT ceramics are significantly less hard and thus the stress \nconcentrations in them are relatively low, when compared to other ceramics. On the\nother hand, it is also claimed that these materials are mechanically more sensitive to \nthermal transients than are other advanced ceramics. This is witnessed by changes in \ntheir pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties (Morgan Matroc Ltd, 2002).\nFurthermore, since domain switching in ferroelectric ceramics is characterized by \nrapid microscopic elastic deformations of each grain, there is a certain concomitant \nchange in the stress regime within the textile structure that occurs during grinding\n(Tanaka and Isono, 2001).\nAs mentioned, residual stress in the subsurface area reflects structural capability and it \nalso influences microscopic properties. Although the volumetric change within the \nsurface or near-surface layer changes with each external loading condition (e.g. \npermanent volumetric compression of microstructures, plastic deformation of the \nsurface layer due to thermal energy and plastic deformation of the surface layer due to \nimpact force), it can be said that internal deformation of microstructures are the main \nreason for the development of residual stress (Griffiths, 2001). This implies that brittle \ndamage such as subsurface cracking and\/or grain pull out can also be a significant\ncause of variation in the residual stress distribution, because these fracture defects are \ninitiated through plastic deformation and generation of dislocations during the \nmachining process.\nThe ultra-precision machine tool used for the experimental part of this study was \nTetraform C. This is an example of a precision machine tool that has been designed \nspecifically to meet the requirement of extremely high stiffness for ultra-precision \ngrinding of hard materials (Cranfield University and Loadpoint Ltd., UK). It has a \ntetrahedral frame consisting of several closed column loops, which contribute to high \nstatic and dynamic stability, enabling the machine to produce a ground surface quality \non the nano-scale for a wide range of materials (Corbett et al., 2000; Corbett, 2001a; \nCorbett and Stephenson, 2001b; McKeown and Corbett, 2004, Corbett et al., 1999). A \nprototype machine Tetraform 1 was equipped with hydraulic damping devices inside \nthe columns to ensure a high dynamic consistency (Slocum, 1992), however these \nwere omitted for Tetraform C as it was found later that the tetrahedral structural frame \nitself had dominant damping properties. Tetraform C has a vertical grinding spindle \naxis and horizontal X and Y axis capability. Aerostatic bearings are used for the \nspindle unit, whereas the X-Y axes consisted of hydrostatic feed screws and guide \nways. Each linear axis is operated by a position control system, whose sensing and \npositioning resolutions are 10.0 nanometres and 1.0 micron respectively, controlled \nusing a high resolution interferometric grating liner encoder (Heidenhain LIP 40R).\nUtilization of hydrostatic mechanical components is typical for this kind of machine \ntool to enhance the motion accuracy. \n3. Investigation of Material Removal Behaviour\nIn the first phase of this research work, the microscopic damage propagation \nmechanism and the practical material removal mechanism of PZT ceramics were \ninvestigated in cup grinding mode using diamond abrasive grits. The fundamental \nmachinability of the PZT ceramics was analyzed and the machined surfaces \nthoroughly examined. On the basis of these investigations a series of statistical \ngrinding experiments was devised and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried \nout in order to identify which significant technical factors can lead to enhancement of \nsurface integrity. The results are discussed below with reference to the material \nremoval behavior of PZT ceramics, not assuming a single point material removal \nmodel, but instead describing the interaction of multiple abrasive grits used in \npractical grinding.\n3-1. Fundamental Evaluation of Damage Propagation\nThe initial surface damage investigations highlighted two key factors in the practical \ngrinding of piezoelectric ceramics namely the relative weakness of the grain \nboundaries and a high sensitivity to heat generation.\nFigure 1 shows two different microscopic optical views of the same area of a PZT \nceramic surface, which was finished by polishing with fine alumina particles of 3.0 \nmicrons. By inspection of these surfaces, it was found that during the sintering \nprocess porosity was generated everywhere inside and between spherical textures, \nwhich range in size up to around 300 microns in diameter. This is an artifact of the \nmixed-oxide route used in manufacturing. Particles (sub-micron or a few microns in \ndiameter) of the ceramic pre-cursor, which have been pretreated, crushed and mixed \nin order to enhance their reactivity, are bound together with a binding compound in a \nspray-and-dry process, producing many fine granules. The spherical texture (and the \nporosity) observed in Figure 1 is a result of the permanent binding phenomenon of the \ngranules during high temperature sintering and it is understood that the generation of \ntiny pores is consistent with many commercial PZT ceramics.\nIt was realized from the micrographs that the porous discontinuities characteristically \nfall into two different modal types depending on their location. Hence the categories \nof \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018boundary\u2019 porosity are defined in this study as shown in Figure 1.\nObservations have subsequently confirmed that the pores do constitute potential sites \nfor mechanical damage initiation, such as dislocation and micro-cracking. This is \nparticularly true when a pore possesses an acute angled edge or several sharp edges at \nits boundary. These positions are extremely sensitive origins of stress concentration \nand consequently exhibit poor mechanical toughness. In a material removal process \nwith multipoint abrasive grits, these defects are subject to stress concentration both by \nthe applied grinding force and its dynamic variation with time.\nFigure 2 shows an extreme example of machining damage, resulting from this \nfractural phenomenon and leading to structural failure. Examination of the fracture-\nsurface showed that the PZT ceramic disc has cracked along only one of the trace \nmarks left by the grinding wheel. This occurred spontaneously some time after \nmachining and it provides clear evidence that high stress concentration inside the bulk \noccurs due to the grinding force. Even if the mechanical damage is almost invisible\nafter grinding and does not initially result in such a severe incident, there are \nobviously potential sources of failure where stress is concentrated and this also has \nconsequences for the fatigue behaviour of the material.\nWith reference to the material properties of PZT ceramics, this fractural tendency can \nbe explained by their high sensitivity to external forces and temperatures. Often this is \nattributed to the presence of dopants or excess lead, which tends to weaken the \nfracture toughness of the grain boundaries and causes high ductility at elevated\ntemperatures (Tanaka and Isono, 2001). In this respect machinability can be viewed as \nonly one of a suite of materials properties, along with the excellent pyroelectric and \npiezoelectric properties which also derive from the selective addition of dopants to the \nbasic composition. Hence in practice some commercial grades of PZT show better \nmachinability than others.\n3-2. Modeling the Material Removal Behaviour\nSince high concentration and continuous variation of the grinding forces were\nidentified as major reasons for deterioration of the finished quality on PZT ceramic \nsurfaces in the first phase of this research work, the next step sought to evaluate the \nrelative importance of technical factors such as grinding parameters and material \nproperties. Uniquely, the systematic engagement between the tool and the workpiece \nwas also taken into account as a design factor (vertical compliance) for the tooling \ncomponents. Although it is generally considered ideal to avoid unwanted movement \nbetween the grinding wheel and the workpiece surface during machining, it was \nconsidered this point should, even so, be scientifically evaluated for successful surface \nintegrity control in ultra-precision grinding for these ceramics.\nIn order to compare the significance of such various technical factors \ncomprehensively, the statistical analysis ANOVA was applied in the second phase of\ninvestigation. This methodology has the capability to highlight the technically \nsignificant factors which control the finished surface integrity with regard to the \naspects of the microscopic material removal mode, machining environment, tooling \ndesign and also their respective interactions (Arai, 2004).\nThe interaction of the defined technical factors is very significant. It is both\ntheoretically and practically known that appropriate combinations of spindle speed \nand feed rate can improve surface roughness in ultra-precision grinding, because these \nconditions can produce finer chip thickness, followed by ductile material removal \n(Stephenson et al., 2001) Furthermore, it also became evident from the initial grinding \ntrials that the workpiece tooling method has a strong influence on the consistency of \nthe grinding forces. These tendencies imply that the interactions between each \ngrinding parameter, including design contributions from the machine structure and \ntooling components, all influence stability at the material removal points and they also \nneed to be taken into account when identifying the major influential factors for \ngrinding PZT ceramics.\nWith this background, a statistical array of L16 ( 2\n15 ), which possesses a high degree \nof freedom suitable for the significance analysis of many technical factors and their \ninteractions, was designed for the grinding evaluation.\nTable 1 shows the designed array for the series of statistical grinding experiments. \nThe defined factors are A - feed rate, B - spindle speed, A\u00d7B, C - work piece material, \nA\u00d7C, B\u00d7C, A\u00d7B\u00d7C, D - abrasive grit size, A\u00d7D, F - work depth of cut, A\u00d7B\u00d7D, G -\nchuck design for work piece, A\u00d7G, C\u00d7F and A\u00d7B\u00d7G. There were two sets of \nstatistical experiments, one performed with and one without ELID (electrolytic in-\nprocess dressing). This approach was used to consider the effect of the environmental \ncontrol of grinding process. Resin and cast iron bonded cup grinding wheels with \ndiamond abrasive grit sizes  3 ~ 6 and 6 ~ 12 microns,  were used for each set of \ngrinding experiments. Unpoled hard and soft PZT bulk ceramic workpieces (diameter\n50 mm, thickness 2.0 mm), each having an average grain size of approximately 5 ~ 7 \nmicrons, were prepared for both experiments. The tooling devices used were a\nvacuum chuck, consisting simply of a bolted aluminum plate fixture, which provided\nlittle vertical compliance (high rigidity) and a porous ceramic fixture, which provided\nhigh vertical compliance (flexible elasticity) due to its flexible holding interface.\nTable 2 (a) - (c) shows the results of the statistical evaluation for the grinding \nexperiments without ELID. The general tendencies mainly reveal physical damage \nand the influence of heat generation, which are due to loading the elements on the \ngrinding wheel. This is shown schematically in Figure 3 as workpiece chips which \nbecome stuck on the surface of a grinding wheel. The need for effective \nenvironmental control in ultra-precision grinding is emphasized by this observation;\nin this case to achieve continuous elimination of the loading elements at the material\nremoval points.\nFigure 4 shows two micrographs of workpiece surfaces finished with fine (a) and \ncoarse (b) abrasive grits respectively in a set of statistical grinding experiments \nwithout ELID. Whilst a severely fractured texture can be observed in image (a), a fine \nsurface finish and a relatively large ductile material removal area, with constant trace \nmarks generated by abrasive grits, can be observed in image (b). One suggestion \narising from the statistical analysis for conventional grinding without ELID is that the \nselection of a relatively coarse abrasive grit size can provide the benefit of large gaps \nbetween the abrasive grits and the workpiece surface. This could reduce subsequent\ndeterioration of the finished surface integrity due to scratching by chips and heat \ngeneration by burnishing.\nTable 3 (a) - (c) shows the results of statistical evaluation for the grinding experiments \nwith ELID. In a comprehensive evaluation, it has become apparent that some \nsignificant factors showed totally opposite tendencies in comparison to those observed \nwhen grinding without ELID. One of these is the advantage of applying a relatively \ngreater depth of cut. Figure 5 shows typical examples of the workpiece surfaces\nfinished with deeper and shallower depths of cut with coarse diamond abrasive grits \nand ELID, these correspond to the images (a) and (b) respectively. A sharply finished \nsurface and a relatively large ductile material removal area, with constant trace marks \ngenerated by abrasive grits, can be observed in image (a), whilst a severely burnished\nsurface texture appears in image (b). This tendency was thought to be associated with \nthe selections of the feed rate and the spindle speed, which result in differences to the \ncontact frequency of the abrasive grits. It was confirmed that the grinding \nenvironment was changed significantly with the utilization of ELID.\nFurthermore, the design effect of the tooling component has also been identified as a \nsignificant factor through the ANOVA process, even when applying ELID. Statistical \noptimization of the grinding factors, surprisingly, shows that a tooling component\nwith a ceramic fixture, in other words a relatively highly compliant fixture could \ncontribute to an enhancement of surface flatness. This observation is totally opposite \nto the accepted maxim that extremely high rigidity in the mechanical components is \ncrucial for achieving extremely fine surface integrity in ultra-precision machining.\nSystematic statistical evaluation of the technical parameters has highlighted some key \nfeatures that can be simplified to reveal the true practical material removal mode and \nsuggest an appropriate strategy to control the material removal process. As a result of \nthis experimental phase, a combination of statistically identified points has led to the \ncreation of a new model for material removal in cup wheel grinding of PZT ceramics \nwith multipoint abrasive grits. \nFigure 6 summaries a general concept of this hypothesis, which is mainly associated \nwith an advantage of applying a deeper work depth of cut. Figure 6 (a) shows \nschematically a material removal mode assuming a deeper work depth of cut, whilst \n(b) shows the effect of a shallower work depth of cut. In general, the (b) condition \ntends to be considered ideal for precision surface finishing of brittle materials, \nbecause this shallower depth of cut condition, which is close to the critical depth of \ncut, leads to ductile material removal mode at the surface. However, the statistical \nanalysis applied here reveals the obvious tendency that this condition causes severe \ngrain pull out of textures and deterioration of surface flatness for PZT ceramic bulks.\nAdditionally, through visual inspections and measurements of the finished surfaces \nunder the deeper work depth of cut (as shown in Figure 6 (a), there is clearly a \ntendency for micro-fracture damage to occur at the leading (external) edge of a cup \ngrinding wheel. Effectively this assists fine material finishing in ductile mode at the \nsecondary material removal zone, (corresponding to the bottom of the grinding wheel), \nwhich results not only a good surface roughness, but also an excellent surface flatness.\nIn essence, fracture damage initiated by the leading edge of the grinding wheel  \ncontributes to an effective reduction of material toughness on the PZT ceramic surface \nand immediate sub-surface, thereby subjecting the material to less stress concentration \nand less heat generation.\nA unique aspect of this hypothesis is that a combination of brittle and ductile material \nremoval is considered to be beneficial and this is because of reduction of stress \nconcentration and heat generation at the material removal interface. This phenomenon\nwas actually found to occur when a relatively large work depth of cut was applied. \nFurthermore, when worn and inclined edges are present at the external edge of the \nwheel bonding segment, the actual work depth of cut becomes much finer in the \nsecondary material removal zone, and this also contributes to an enhanced surface \nintegrity on PZT bulk ceramics.\nAlthough the material removal model suggested here has potential applicability for \nother polycrystalline brittle materials, it should be noted that it is dependent on the\nmechanical behaviour of the workpiece material. In particular the effective fracture \ntoughness of the grain boundaries, which may ultimately depend on material \ncharacteristics such as dislocation density and mobility, needs to fall within a certain \nrange.\n3-3. Modeling of Material Fractural Types\nIn the third phase of material removal analysis, an optimization of the grinding \nparameters was carried out for cup wheel grinding under stationary traverse mode.\nThe trials resulted in visual categorization of the mechanical damage and fracture \ndefects, including initial porosity. Two commonly occurring types of fracture defect \nwere identified for surfaces ground in the deeper work depth of cut with ELID, and \nthis has consequently led to an effective choice of grinding conditions for fine surface\nfinishing of PZT bulk ceramics.\nFigure 7 shows schematic views of the fracture types, which relate to initial porosity, \nnamely grain pull-out and defacing, both of which are identified in the current \nresearch work. Normally, the fracture behaviour of brittle materials is discussed on \nthe basis of well-known crack propagation modes such as median, lateral and radial \ncracks (Li and Liao, 1997). However, these types of crack were not observed during \nthe investigation for PZT ceramic grinding. Instead, where the surface finish shows \nmacroscopic damage, the tendency is towards grain pull-out (as shown in Figure 4) \nand random shallow peeling (defacing).\nThe fracture toughness of piezoelectric materials is relatively weak at the grain \nboundaries compared to other structural ceramics (Tanaka and Isono, 2001), and when \nthe frequency of abrasive contacts was high, at relatively low feed-rate, it was \nobserved in these experiments that grain pull-out became more evident. Probably this \nphenomenon relates to high adherence in the PZT material and weakening of the grain \nboundaries due to high frequency stress variation. Meanwhile, if a high feed rate is \napplied, assuming the same spindle revolution speed, then the theoretical amount of \nmaterial removed from the workpiece surface by each of the abrasive grits is greater. \nThis induces more severe two dimensional frictional behavior at the material removal \ninterface. As most of the PZT ceramics exhibit a high thermal sensitivity, a \ncombination of heat generation and adherence can be regarded as the cause of the \nobserved surface defacing.\nThrough microscopic evaluation of the frequency of these two fracture types,\nsummarized in Figure 7, optimum grinding parameters were identified for cup wheel \ngrinding in stationary traverse mode. The optimum condition, defined with a feed rate \nof 5.0 mm\/min, was found to produce the minimum defect density in both of the chief \nmicro-fractural modes, ie. grain pull out and defacing. This result provides \ncomprehensive evidence of the benefit of less contact and frictional behavior at \nmaterial removal interface, and subsequently less stress variation and thermal \ninfluence on the finished surface.\nConsequently, it has been confirmed that categorization of the fractural behaviour, in \nthe manner suggested here, can be used to understand practical material removal \nmodes, and this can be used as an effective indicator to optimize grinding conditions \nfor polycrystalline materials such as PZT ceramics. It should be stated here that the \noptimized grinding condition has resulted in enhancement of surface flatness of less \nthan 2.0 micrometer over 50 mm round PZT ceramic bulks and this reflects less \nvariation of residual stress distribution in the subsurface area. However, the same \ncondition leads to a slight deterioration of the surface roughness and textural integrity\nas a compromise (Arai, 2005).\n4. Design Contribution of the Tooling Component\nWith respect to the contribution of machine tool components for successful material \nremoval in ultra-precision machining, it is generally claimed that the stability of the \nloop distance on the machine tool structure, defined as a work depth of cut between a \ngrinding wheel bottom surface and workpiece surface in cup grinding mode, has a \ncritical influence on controlling the grinding forces. Thus it should be high and \nconsistent for enhancement of surface integrity, mainly surface roughness (Slocum, \n1992). Meanwhile, as described in the previous section, it has became evident through\nstatistical evaluation of PZT ceramic grinding conditions that a relatively soft tooling \ndevice performs effectively in achieving fine surface flatness. \nThis tendency implies that the structural performance of both the grinding machine\ntool and also the tooling device is significantly associated with surface integrity \ncontrol in ultra-precision machining. In fact counter-intuitive features have to be \nadopted occasionally so that surface roughness and flatness are optimized \nsimultaneously. From this point of view, a machine design contribution was evaluated \nin the next phase of experimentation; in order to acquire practical knowledge for \ngrinding process.\nSufficient stability of the loop distance in ultra-precision grinding can be achieved \nonly when the overall stiffness of the machine structure is extremely high. With \nincreased stiffness there is a tendency for the structural mass to also increase and this \ngenerally results in structures with a low resonance frequency. Perversely this can\ncause severe dynamic errors in the loop distance and consequently extreme \ndeterioration of machined workpiece quality. Therefore, the balance between the \nstructural stiffness and mass tends to be considered as the most fundamental but \nsignificant point in the design process of machine tool structures. Consistency of the \nloop distance, tends to be regarded as an advanced characteristic, and there has been \nno clearly identified approach to cope with this factor. Although high rigidity is one of \nthe philosophies that has been applied, it is difficult to keep structural compliance\nconsistent at the loop distance in the wide range of dynamic excitation. Therefore, as \nanother approach, enhancement of the damping property could potentially be used as \na substitute to minimize machine-structural errors. However, high internal damping \nratios usually assume a certain structural flexibility, and thus this is difficult to \nachieve under the restriction of a low compliance design concept. Furthermore, it is \nnot technically easy to quantify damping characteristics as a simplified indicator on a \ncomplex machine tool structure. Therefore, the damping property of structural\ncomponents and mechanical interfaces tends to be ignored on machine tool structures. \nIf necessary certain damping elements tend to be installed as subsidiary components, \nsuch as adaptive sheets and\/or hydraulic devices outside the main structural loop\n(Slocum, 1992).\nIn the series of machinability trials of PZT ceramics described above, it was \noccasionally observed that static and dynamic inconsistency of the loop distance, \nleading to variation of the grinding forces, caused a significant deterioration in the \nsurface roughness, flatness and the textural integrity of the PZT ceramics. Since the \nstructural stiffness could not be increased, the material removal interface between the \nabrasive grits and workpiece was chosen as an accessible point where enhancement of \nthe damping property could significantly lead to improvements in the finished surface \nquality. Accordingly a workpiece tooling component was designed with the objective \nof attenuating dynamic errors in the direction of the loop distance, and the most \nimportantly, to improve interfacial contact in the material removal zone.\nFigure 8 shows a damping vacuum chuck developed for this purpose. The main part \nof this device, which is a hybrid tooling structure, was arranged to hold a workpiece\nby vacuum, with air extracted through an array of pinholes. This arrangement can give \na consistently distributed suction force and minimize distortion of a PZT workpiece. \nThe hybrid tooling structure consists of a viscoelastic polymer layer inserted between \ntwo aluminum plates. This structure has the ability to transform the dynamic energy \nof bending vibration modes into frictional energy inside the viscoelastic polymer layer, \nand hence to effectively absorb the mechanical vibration. When the two aluminum\nplates vibrate in the same bending mode, the viscoelastic polymer layer between them \nexpands and shrinks in-plane. Since the polymeric layer consists of long chain \nmolecules, respective motion of each molecule causes microscopic friction and this \nphenomenon results in heat generation. In practice, this form of energy dissipation can \ntypically be expected only when the hybrid tooling structure deforms in bending \nmodes.\nUnder static conditions, the bending stiffness of the hybrid tooling structure is less \nthan that of an aluminum solid plate whose dimensions are the same as those of the \nhybrid tooling structure. This feature gives a flexible acceptance at the material \nremoval interface and a stable, in other words averaged, internal stress distribution\ninside the workpiece in practical grinding. Although serial installation of soft \ncomponents into the structural loop directly between a tool and workpiece is rare due \nto the lack of rigidity, both attenuation of dynamic errors and consistency of stress \ndistribution inside the workpiece are expected in this case.\nThe viscoelastic material used was an acrylic polymer whose thickness is less than 1.0 \nmm. This material has the particular dynamic response that high frequency excitation \ninduces high stiffness. As with most polymers stiffness is also temperature dependent. \nHence if grinding forces vary in the high frequency range, the structural stiffness \nbecomes high. In other words, the actual mechanical characteristics of the hybrid \ntooling structure respond dynamically to variations in the grinding forces.\nIn the final phase of experimentation the performance of hybrid tooling structures was\nstudied, with various different polymer layer thicknesses, in order to evaluate the \ngeneral effect of the suggested strategy on surface integrity for PZT ceramics.\nFigure 9 (a) \u2013 (c) shows plots of general performance data with regard to several \nhybrid tooling structures with different viscoelastic polymer thicknesses (50.8, 127, \n254 and 508 microns). The dynamic behavior was modeled using numerical \nsimulations and it was verified through experimental modal analysis of the hybrid \ntooling structures (subsequently followed by grinding experiments). It became \napparent that each hybrid tooling structure has a different resonance frequency\ndirectly related to the thickness variation of viscoelastic polymer layer. Energy \ndissipation was obtained, although the real damping performance was attenuated due \nto a lack of stiffness in the support elements of the hybrid tooling structure.\nMeanwhile, it was revealed after grinding trials that these tooling devices improve the \nfinished surface integrity dramatically. Optical quality being obtained on the ground \nworkpieces. Typical examples are shown in Figure 10 (a) - (d). These results clearly\nshow that the tooling device can dissipate the energy of the structural bending \nvibrations significantly at the material removal interface in practical grinding. The \nsurface flatness obtained in the grinding experiments was also improved with the \ninstallation of the hybrid tooling structure, and this implies that quasi-static soft \ncontact manner at the material removal points enhances the consistency of grinding \nforces to give a stable stress distribution, and the most importantly, less fractural \ndamage on workpiece surfaces. \nA series of ceramic samples, produced under the optimized grinding condition,\nshowed that a balance of structural stiffness and acceptance, in other words, an \naccuracy guaranteed by the machine structure and appropriate flexibility which \ncompensates for static and dynamic error modes at the material removal interface, is \nsignificant in successful ultra-precision grinding of PZT ceramics. Figure 11 shows \nthe general concept of this idea, which emphasizes the advantage of the soft contact \nstrategy. \n5. Conclusion\nMaterial removal mechanisms in practical ultra-precision grinding of PZT ceramics \nand the effect of the tooling component were investigated interactively in order to \ndetermine the conditions required for consistently high quality of surface roughness, \nsurface flatness with minimum fractural damage.\nIn the first machinability trials, microscopic fractural modes were investigated. This \nrevealed that native porosity in the bulk shows certain networks that are associated \nwith the sintering process. During machining, these defects become the origins of \ndislocation and crack propagation, which are assisted significantly by relatively low\nboundary toughness between the polycrystalline textures.\nBy applying statistical methods the key technical factors were defined for successful \nultra-precision grinding of PZT ceramics. This was achieved through comprehensive\nevaluation of the tendencies revealed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a \nseries of discussions has subsequently led to the establishment of a unique material \nremoval model for multi-point practical grinding of PZT ceramics. It should be noted \nthat the statistical evaluation considers not only grinding parameters and material \nproperties, but also design characteristics of tooling devices and furthermore \ninteractions of technically defined factors, assuming the material removal manner as a \nsystematic phenomenon.\nDuring the experimental optimization of the grinding parameters, defects induced on \nthe ground surfaces were categorized, and the frequency of each type on the finished \nsurfaces was assessed. This methodology has provided a good explanation for the \nvisual evidence, and a recommendation for the grinding parameters needed to \nguarantee excellent surface roughness and flatness on PZT bulk ceramics.\nIn the final phase of investigation, the contribution of a tooling component was \ndiscussed, and then this has led to the development of a hybrid tooling device which \naims to appropriately control the manner of contact at the material removal interface. \nIn a departure from conventional thinking, a vacuum chuck with a viscoelastic\npolymer interlayer was developed. This was found to enhance damping characteristics \nand hence consistency of the stress distribution during the grinding process. \nConsequently, it became apparent that the tooling device performs effectively to give\ndrastic improvement of ground surface integrity and this was verified by \nexperimentation.\nThrough all of the discussions, it has been theoretically and experimentally confirmed \nthat successful surface integrity control in practical ultra-precision grinding can be \nachieved only when the interface condition between the abrasive grits and the \nworkpiece surface is appropriately controlled. The soft contact approach, which has \nbeen discussed mainly in relation to tooling development, can provide a major \nbreakthrough for surface integrity control of brittle materials by ultra-precision \ngrinding.\n6.
