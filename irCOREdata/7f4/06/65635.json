This paper explores the possible reasons behind the absence of a politics of \nhealth and demonstrates how explicit acknowledgement of the political nature of \nhealth will lead to more effective health promotion strategy and policy, and to more \nrealistic and evidence-based public health and health promotion practice. \n \n \nKey words: politics, policy, health determinants. \n   \nINTRODUCTION \nIt is profoundly paradoxical that, in a period when the importance of public policy as \na determinant of health is routinely acknowledged, there remains a continuing absence \nof mainstream debate about the ways in which the politics, power, and ideology \nwhich underpin it influence people's health. For a rare example, see Navarro and Shi \n(Navarro and Shi, 2001). While to some extent the unhealthy policies of the Reagan \nand Thatcher governments of 20 years ago acted as a stimulus to such debate, as early \nas the mid-1980s, the introduction of the World Health Organisation's Health For All \nstrategy (WHO, 1985) created the illusion that these issues had finally - and \nadequately - been acknowledged. Experience since then suggests that such views can \nand very clearly should be challenged.  \nIn this article we argue that health, and its promotion, are profoundly political. \nWe explore the possible reasons behind the absence of a \u2018politics of health\u2019 in \nmainstream debate and demonstrate how an awareness of the political nature of health \nwill lead to more effective health promotion strategy and more evidence-based health \npromotion practice. \nTHE POLITICAL NATURE OF HEALTH \nIt is time that the implicit, and sometimes explicit but unstated politics within and \nsurrounding health were more widely acknowledged. Health, like almost all other \naspects of human life, is political in numerous ways: \n\uf0a7 Health is political because, like any other resource or commodity under a neo-\nliberal economic system, some social groups have more of it than others. \n\uf0a7 Health is political because its social determinants are amenable to political \ninterventions and are thereby dependent on political action (or more usually, \ninaction).  \n   \n\uf0a7 Health is political because the right to \u2018a standard of living adequate for health \nand well-being\u2019 (UN, 1948) is, or should be, an aspect of citizenship and a \nhuman right. \nUltimately, health is political because power is exercised over it as part of a wider \neconomic, social and political system. Changing this system requires political \nawareness and political struggle.  \nHealth inequalities \nEvidence that the most powerful determinants of health in modern populations are \nsocial, economic, and cultural (Doyal and Pennell, 1979; Townsend and Davidson, \n1992; Whitehead, 1992; Blane et al., 1996; Acheson, 1998) comes from a wide range \nof sources and is also, to some extent, acknowledged by governments and \ninternational agencies (Townsend and Davidson, 1992; Social Exclusion Unit, 1998; \nDepartment of Health, 1998; Acheson, 1998). Yet inequalities in health continue, \nwithin countries (on the basis of socio-economic class, gender or ethnicity) and \nbetween them (in terms of wealth and resources) (Donkn et al.,  2002; Davey Smith et \nal., 2002).  \nHow these inequalities in health are approached by society is highly political: \nare health inequalities to be accepted as \u2018natural\u2019 and inevitable results of individual \ndifferences both in respect of genetics and the silent hand of the economic market, or \nare they social and economic abhorrences that need to be tackled by a modern state \nand a humane society (Adams et al.,  2002)? Underpinning these different approaches \nto health inequalities are not only divergent views of what is scientifically or \neconomically possible, but also differing political and ideological opinions about what \nis desirable.   \n \n   \nHealth determinants \nCauses of, and genetic predispositions to ill health are becoming increasingly well \nunderstood. However, it is evident that in most cases, environmental triggers are \nequally if not more important and that the major determinants of health or ill health \nare inextricably linked to social and economic context (Acheson, 1998; Marmot and \nWilkinson, 2001). Factors such as housing, income, and employment - indeed many \nof the issues that dominate political life - are key determinants of our health and \nwellbeing. Similarly, many of the major determinants of health inequalities lie outside \nthe health sector and therefore require non-health sector policies to tackle them \n(Townsend and Davidson, 1992; Acheson, 1998; Whitehead et al.,  2000). Recent \nacknowledgements of the importance of the social determinants of health are \nwelcome but fail to seriously address the underlying political determinants of health \nand health inequity.  \nCitizenship \nCitizenship is \u2018a status bestowed on those who are full members of a community. All \nwho possess the status are equal with respect to the rights and duties with which the \nstatus is endowed\u2019 (Marshall, 1963). There are three types of citizenship rights: civil, \npolitical and social. Health, or the \u2018right to a standard of living adequate for health \nand well-being\u2019 (UN, 1948; IFDH, 2002), is an important social citizenship right. \nThese citizenship rights were only gained as a result of extensive political and social \nstruggle during Western industrialisation and the development of capitalism \n(Marshall, 1963). However, despite their parallel development (see Figure 1), the \nrelationship between capitalism and citizenship is not an easy or \u2018natural\u2019 one \n(Marshall, 1963). Health is a strong example of this tense relationship as under a \ncapitalist economic system health is, like everything else, commodified. \n   \nCommodification is \u2018the process whereby everything becomes identifiable and valued \naccording to its relative desirability within the economic market (of production and \nconsumption)\u2019 (di Viggiani, 1997). Health became extensively commodified during \nthe industrial revolution as workers became entirely dependent upon the market for \ntheir survival (Esping-Andersen, 1990). In the 20\nth\n century, the introduction of social \ncitizenship, which entailed an entitlement to health and social welfare, brought about \na \u2018loosening\u2019 of the pure commodity status of health. The welfare state \ndecommodified health because certain health services and a certain standard of living \nbecame a right of citizenship.  \nIn short, capitalism and citizenship represent very different values: the former, \ninequality and the latter, equality. This tension means that the implementation of the \nright to health, despite its position in social citizenship and in the UN Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, will for the foreseeable future require  continuing  \npolitical struggle.  \nWHY HAS HEALTH BEEN APOLITICAL? \nIt is perhaps puzzling that despite its evident political nature, the politics of health has \nbeen underdeveloped and marginalised: it has not been widely considered or \ndiscussed as a political entity within academic debates or, more importantly, broader \nsocietal ones. There is no simple explanation for this omission; the treatment of health \nas apolitical is almost certainly the result of a complex interaction of issues. We \ndescribe some of these below, though we would not claim that our list is exhaustive. \nHealth = health care  \nHealth is often reduced and misrepresented as health care (or in the UK, as the \nNational Health Service). Consequently, the politics of health becomes significantly \nmisconstructed as the politics of health care - see for example Freeman (Freeman,  \n   \n2000). As an illustration, the majority of popular UK political discussions about \nhealth concern issues such as the 'State or the market?' debate about National Health \nService (NHS) funding, organisation, and delivery, or the demographic pressures on \nthe future provision of healthcare facilities (Rhodes, 1997). The same applies in most \nother \u2013 especially 'developed'  \u2013 countries. \nThe limited, one-dimensional (Carpenter, 1980) nature of this political \ndiscourse surrounding health can be traced back to two ideological issues: the \ndefinition of health and the definition of politics. The definition of health that has \nconventionally been operationalised under Western capitalism has two interrelated \naspects to it: health is both considered as the absence of disease (biomedical \ndefinition) and as a commodity (economic definition). These both focus on \nindividuals, as opposed to society, as the basis of health: health is seen as a product of \nindividual factors such as genetic heritage or lifestyle choices, and as a commodity \nwhich individuals can access either via the market or the health system   (Scott-\nSamuel, 1979). This remains the case despite our sophisticated understanding of \nhealth promotion \u2013 as is evident if one ignores the rhetoric of the governments of \n'developed' nations and looks instead at their health policies. \nHealth in this sense is an individualised commodity that is produced and \ndelivered by the market or the health service. Inequalities in the distribution of health \nare therefore either a result of the failings of individuals through, for example, their \nlifestyle choices; or of the way in which health care products are produced, distributed \nand delivered. In order to tackle these inequalities, political attention is directed \ntowards the variable that is most amenable to manipulation - the healthcare system.  \nIt is important to note that this limiting, one-dimensional view of health is \ncommon across the ideological spectrum, with left-wing versus right-wing health \n   \ndebates usually consisting of a more versus less state intervention dichotomy. \nOrthodox UK left wing politics is guilty of placing health care and the NHS at the \ncentre of its discussions and struggles about health. This \u2018NHS illusion\u2019 has resulted \nin the naive perspective amongst health activists that societal ill-health can be cured \nby more and better NHS services. At best, this perspective is slowly changing, as is \nshown by the enthusiasm of some in the UK for New Labour's emphasis on tackling \nhealth inequalities through the NHS \u2013 while it simultaneously widens them through its \nneo-liberal macroeconomic, trade and foreign policies (Bambra, Fox and Scott-\nSamuel, 2003). \nHealth and politics \nFigure 2 outlines four broad definitions of politics.  The first concept, which is the \nmost prevalent definition within mainstream political discourse, places very restrictive \nboundaries around what politics is \u2013 the activities of governments, elites and state \nagencies - and therefore also restricts who is political and who can engage in politics \n(i.e. the members of governments, state agencies and other elite organisations). It is a \n\u2018top-down\u2019 approach that essentially separates politics from the community. This \nshould be contrasted with the last definition, which offers a much more encompassing \nview of politics: politics is everything; it is a term that can be used to describe any \n\u2018power-structured relationship\u2019  (Millett, 1969). This is a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach as any \nand every issue is political and likewise anyone and everyone can engage in a political \nact.  \nThe dominance of the first conceptualisation of politics, as the art of \ngovernment and the activities of the state, influences which aspects of health are \nconsidered to be political. Health care, especially in countries like the UK where the \nstate\u2019s role is significant, is an immediate subject for political discussion. Other \n   \naspects of health, such as health inequalities or health and citizenship, are excluded \nfrom this narrow popular definition of politics and are thereby seen as non-political. \nIn order to increase which aspects of health are regarded as political, our \nunderstanding of politics needs to be contested and redefined. \nHealth and political science \nHealth has not been seriously studied within political science - nor for that matter, \nwith a handful of exceptions (Signal, 1998; McGinnis et al., 2002; Navarro, 2002),  \nhas politics within health promotion. This has compounded its exclusion from the \npolitical realm. Health to a political scientist, in common with more widely held \nviews, most often means only one thing:  health care; and usually, only one minor \naspect of health care: the health care system.  Some political scientists will argue that \nthey do study health as a political entity; however, what is actually under analysis is \nthe politics of health care.  \nThe roots of this focus on health care derive from the dominance of certain \nschools of thought within political science and of their corresponding definitions of \nthe political. Figure 2 outlined the different schools of thought in political science and \ntheir respective conceptualisations of politics. These schools are not of equal weight \nwithin political science and the discipline is dominated, especially in the USA, by the \nbehavouralist, institutionalist, and rational choice strands. To adherents of these \nschools politics - and therefore political science - is concerned with the processes, \nconditions and institutions of mainstream politics and government. The politics of \nhealth care is therefore the politics of institutions, systems, funding, and elite \ninteractions. Health, in its broader sense, is therefore apolitical and should only be the \nconcern of disciplines such as sociology, public health or medicine. In this way \n   \nspecified aspects of health, namely health care issues, are politically defined as \npolitical while all other aspects are not. \n \n \nResponsibility and authority \nThe conceptualisation of health as non-political is also in part due to medicalisation - \nthe transfer of power over and responsibility for health from individuals, the public \nand therefore political life, to powerful elites, namely the medical and health \nprofessions and the multinational pharmaceutical companies. \nWhen we conceive of ill-health as episodes of disease manageable by the \ndelivery of healthcare, we are \u2026 transferring the responsibility for health \nfrom society as a whole to an elite possessing what we define as the \nnecessary professional and technical expertise for the management of \ndisease    (Scott-Samuel, 1979) \nHowever, unlike the impression given in the above quote, this transfer of \nresponsibility is not always voluntary. Drug companies and the medical profession \nhave taken the power and responsibility for health for themselves (Illich, 1977). They \nhave thus been able to determine what health is and therefore, how political it is (or, \nmore usually, is not).  \nTheir historic power over the definition and management of health has \ncontributed substantially to its depoliticisation: health is something that doctors are \nresponsible for, they are the providers, and we are the recipients. Their authority and \nresponsibility over health has further emphasised its commodity status \u2013 when ill, an \nindividual visits a doctor and \/ or purchases drugs (commodity) to regain health \n(another, albeit less obvious commodity). Ill health is a transient state caused by the \n   \npresence of disease. It can be ended by the appropriate application of medical \ntechnology. This depoliticisation of health, via the transfer of power and \nresponsibility to these professional and \/ or commercial groups, means that we do not \nacknowledge our power over our own health or our autonomy over our own bodies. \nHealth policy \nHealth policy, as currently popularly conceptualised, is usually synonymous with \npolicy content. Certainly, it is relatively unusual to find discussions of health policy \nthat are not focused on the pros and cons of particular courses of action in relation to \nparticular political parties. In reality, however, health policy is part of a broader public \npolicy agenda, whose practical aspects are inextricably linked with power and \npolitics. Given this, the reduction of 'health policy' to 'the content of health policies' \ndiverts attention from, and renders invisible the political nature of the policy process. \nPolicy is formulated within certain preset political parameters which define what is, \nand what is not, possible or acceptable. For example, the fundamental requirement \nwithin Western neo-liberal economies for inequality (between those who labour and \nthose who profit) makes the meaning of UK government policies to 'tackle \ninequalities' at best highly questionable - no modern government will support a policy \nprocess that permits the full implementation of radical equity policy. Government \npolicy in this area therefore consists of (loudly trumpeted) minor reform; no policy \nconnections are ever made with the macro-political causes of the major economic, \nsocial and health inequalities, such as macroeconomic policy, trade policy, defence \npolicy, foreign policy and international development. For example, none of these \nfeatured in the UK Treasury's Cross Cutting Spending Review on Health Inequalities \n(HM Treasury and DoH, 2002), which was intended to examine the impact on health \ninequalities of the expenditure programmes of all government departments. Nor are \n   \nthe actions of the World Trade Organisation, of trans-national corporations, or of the \nWorld Bank usually taken into account. One conclusion regarding this failure to see \nthe wood for the trees is that there is an important need for awareness of how the \npolitical context limits how health policy is formulated. Another is that this failure \ndoes not occur by chance: both the masking of the political nature of health, and the \nforms of the social structures and processes that create, maintain and undermine  \nhealth, are determined by the individuals and groups that wield the greatest political \npower. \nTOWARDS A POLITICS OF HEALTH \nWhat this all adds up to is nothing less than a challenge to a wide range of actors \u2013 \nhealth promotion and public health specialists, policy makers, politicians, health and \npolitical scientists \u2013 to emerge from the closet and to begin the long overdue task of \nelaborating the practice, policy and theory of a newly identified discipline - health \npolitics, the political science of health. We believe that we have more than adequately \njustified the need for health politics  to emerge as a discipline and field of practice no \nless important than medical sociology or health economics on the one hand, or than \npolitical sociology or political psychology on the other. We are confident that the \npractice of health promotion and public health will gain immeasurably from the \nexplicit recognition of this key determinant of health and its incorporation into \nevidence-based strategies, policies and interventions. \n \nAcknowledgement \nWe acknowledge the helpful comments of an anonymous referee. \n \n   \nReferences \nAcheson, D.
