INTRODUCTION 33 \n One of the major problems in physical oceanography is how energy of meteorological 34 \nand tidal origin is transformed through the internal wave field (Van Haren, 2004) into small 35 \nscale mixing processes and how this mixing influences the large scale circulation (e.g. 36 \nSamelson 1998, Spall 2001, Saenko and Merrifield 2005, Saenko 2006).  In terms of wind 37 \nforcing, recent calculations have shown that vorticity associated with small scale eddies in the 38 \nocean can significantly influence the downward diffusion of the wind\u2019s momentum and hence 39 \nmixing at depth (Zhai et al 2005).  In shallow seas, wind forcing in the regions of surface and 40 \nbottom fronts gives rise to internal waves which can be trapped in the frontal region, or 41 \npropagate away (Davies and Xing 2004, Xing and Davies 2005).  In the case of internal 42 \nwaves propagating along the thermocline there can be appreciable mixing at the level of the 43 \nthermocline, namely \u201cinternal mixing\u201d (Van Haren and Howarth 2004), that can lead to 44 \nenhanced across thermocline exchange (Rippeth et al 2005) and breakdown.  In shallow sea 45 \nareas the existence of cold water bottom domes provides a mechanism for internal wave 46 \ntrapping and associated mixing with changes in circulation (Davies and Xing 2005, Xing and 47 \nDavies 2006a). 48 \n In shelf edge regions where the thermocline intersects the shelf slope, the on-off-shelf 49 \nmotion of the tide gives rise to an internal tide which propagates into the ocean (see Baines 50 \n1995, Vlasenko and Stashchuk, 2006, Vlasenko et al 2005, for a comprehensive review).  51 \nHowever the energy dissipation and mixing due to wave-wave interaction associated with this 52 \nradiating tide is thought to be small.  However, recently it has been suggested that internal 53 \nmixing of tidal origin occurs in regions of rough topography (e.g. Xing and Davies 2006b,c) 54 \ndue to its interaction with small scale topography.  Consequently in the last few years 55 \nsignificant modelling and measurements have been made at oceanic features e.g. rides, 56 \nseamounts and shelf slopes (Legg and Adcroft 2003, Legg 2004a,b, Hosegood and Van 57 \n 4 \nHaren (2004), New and Pingree (1990), Van Haren (2004), Legg (2004a,b), Dewey et al 58 \n(2005), Gerkema and Zimmerman (1995), Gerkema (2001, 2002), Gillibrand and Amundrud 59 \n(2007), Jeans and Sherwin (2001a,b) where there is appreciable small scale topography.  60 \nHowever using models to examine the energy cascade in such areas is particularly difficult 61 \ndue to the lack of detailed measurements of far field effects along the extensive open 62 \nboundaries surrounding these features.  This suggests that detailed measurements and 63 \nassociated modelling in semi-enclosed regions with abrupt topography and strong tidal 64 \ncurrents e.g. sills in fjords and lochs (e.g. Inall et al., 2004, 2005) could yield insight into the 65 \nrole of small scale topography upon internal tidal mixing. 66 \n In terms of tidal mixing and dissipation this is particularly large on continental 67 \nshelves.  In these regions, strong tidal currents flowing over a rough sea bed produce a thick 68 \n(of order 50 m) turbulent bottom boundary layer.  In many regions e.g. shallow (water depth 69 \nbelow 50 m) areas of the European Continental Shelf, the bottom boundary layer thickness 70 \nexceeds the water depth and the water column remains well mixed.  In this case the mixing is 71 \ntermed \u201cexternal mixing\u201d in that it is produced at the bottom of the water column and diffuses 72 \naway from the bottom boundary layer into the water column.  The intensity and vertical 73 \nextent of this turbulent boundary layer depends on tidal current strength and bottom 74 \nroughness. 75 \n In deeper water or regions of weak tidal currents, the bottom turbulent boundary layer 76 \nonly occupies a small fraction of the water column (e.g. Davies and Jones 1990) and in 77 \nsummer time a thermocline forms at depth below a well mixed surface layer.  The position of 78 \nthe thermocline and the associated circulation field are determined by the balance between 79 \nturbulence generation and buoyancy suppression (e.g. Xing and Davies 2001). 80 \n In regions such as banks or sills at the entrance to lochs or fjords where the 81 \ntopography is rough and changes rapidly on space scales comparable to the tidal excursion 82 \n 5 \nrecent measurements (Inall et al 2004, 2005) suggest that there is appreciable mixing of tidal 83 \norigin within the thermocline, namely \u201cinternal mixing\u201d.  The small geographical extent of 84 \nthese regions, and particularly in the case of lochs and fjords the fact that tidal forcing is 85 \nthrough one small open boundary, makes them ideal for modelling studies.  In addition 86 \ndetailed measurements of tidal forcing and mixing can be performed.  However, as we will 87 \nshow here, besides detailed measurements of tidal forcing and resulting mixing, significant 88 \nadditional measurements are required, particularly bed roughness and turbulence over the sill 89 \nand in the bottom boundary layer downstream of the sill, in order to close the problem to such 90 \nan extent that rigorous model validation is possible. 91 \n Recent measurements in Loch Etive (Inall et al 2004, 2005) and associated modelling 92 \nstudies showed that a non-hydrostatic model in cross sectional form, with idealized 93 \ntopography, could reproduce the major features of the hydraulic transition, lee wave 94 \nproduction, and mixing found in the observations (Xing and Davies 2006a, hereafter XD06).  95 \nIn addition the model demonstrated the importance of small scale topography on the leeside 96 \nof the sill, upon \u201cinternal mixing\u201d of tidal origin (XD06).  In subsequent calculations Davies 97 \nand Xing 2007, hereafter DX07 the importance of stratification and its vertical variation upon 98 \nlee wave generation and mixing was examined.  These calculations showed that the value of 99 \nthe buoyancy frequency in the region of the top of the sill was critical in determining the 100 \nextent of lee wave generation (DX07).  In this paper that work is extended to examine the 101 \nrole of bottom friction effects and the thickness of the turbulent bottom boundary layer of 102 \ntidal origin upon lee wave formation and associated mixing in the region of sills. 103 \n The model is identical to that used previously (XD06) and is briefly described in the 104 \nnext section.  Subsequently (Section 3) results are presented to show the influence of bottom 105 \nfriction and vertical eddy viscosity, which control turbulence in the bottom boundary layer, 106 \nupon lee wave generation and mixing in the region of abrupt topography.  These calculations 107 \n 6 \nare extended in Section 4, to examine the effect upon lee waves and mixing of water depth 108 \nchange.  In particular for the case of a shallow region where the bottom boundary layer 109 \nthickness is comparable to the height of the sill or bank.  A final section summarized the 110 \nmajor findings of the study, and the extent and comprehensive nature of data sets required for 111 \nmodel validation purposes. 112 \n2. NUMERICAL MODEL 113 \nAs this paper is mainly concerned with how sill depth, aspect ratio and the tidally 114 \ngenerated  bottom turbulent boundary layer influence mixing in sill regions, idealized sill 115 \ntopography was used in all calculations.  In addition a two dimensional (x, z) cross sectional 116 \nform of the model was applied, although this means that along sill and across channel 117 \nchanges in topography were excluded.  Consequently horizontal gyres that can be produced 118 \nby along sill topography or in the region of a bank cannot occur. However, such effects are 119 \noutside the scope of this paper where the emphasis is the role played by the bottom turbulent 120 \nboundary layer.  Here a simple symmetric form of sill topography and water depths 121 \napproximating those of Loch Etive where recent measurements were made (Inall et al 2004, 122 \n2005) is used (Fig. 1a,b).  Initially calculations were performed with a sill in a water depth h 123 \n= 100 m (Fig. 1a) although subsequently water was shallowed to h = 50 m.  By varying the 124 \nsill half width (as), the vertical eddy viscosity (AV) due to tidal mixing, together with water 125 \ndepth and sill height (Table 1), the influence of these parameters that control the bottom 126 \nboundary layer, upon flow field, internal wave spectra and mixing could be determined. 127 \nAs shown by XD07 the vertical velocity and the presence of a hydraulic transition in 128 \nthe sill region means that the hydrostatic approximation is not valid and non-hydrostatic 129 \neffects must be taken into account.  Following previous modelling in sill regions (XD06) the 130 \nMIT model (Adcroft et al., 1997 Marshall et al 1997a,b) which is based on a z coordinate in 131 \nthe vertical and a finite volume discretization was used.  However other non-hydrostatic 132 \n 7 \nmodels using sigma coordinates exist in the literature (e.g. Berntsen et al (2006)) and give 133 \ncomparable solutions for non-hydrostatic problems.  134 \nTopography in the sill region (Fig. 1) is characterized by a constant depth domain 135 \n(water depth h = 100 m or 50 m (Table 1)) on either side of the sill, with an open mouth at x 136 \n= -80 km, where M2 barotropic tidal forcing is applied.  The sill is situated at x = 0, with a 137 \nwater depth (sill depth hs) above the sill that was varied in the calculations. Water depths 138 \nincreasing to h = 100 m or 50 m fixed in all calculations on both sides of the sill, with a 139 \nclosed boundary at its eastern end (x = 80 km).  Initial conditions consisted of a horizontal 140 \nuniform temperature field, with a vertical temperature gradient that was the same in all 141 \ncalculations, namely a buoyancy frequency (N) = 0.01 s\n-1\n.  The Coriolis parameter f was 142 \nfixed at 1.2 x 10\n-4\n s\n-1\n, typical of northern latitude regions where fjord systems occur 143 \n(Stiegbrandt 1999).  Also at time t = 0, zero horizontal (u) and vertical (w) velocity were 144 \nspecified.  A fine uniform grid resolution dz = 1 m was used in the vertical with the 145 \nhorizontal grid gradually varying from dx = 10 m in the sill region to 100 m outside this area.  146 \nWith such a fine grid the background coefficient of horizontal viscosity was set at Ah = 10\n-1\n 147 \nm\n2\n s\n-1\n.  Similarly small background diffusivities of KV = Kh = 10\n-7\n m\n2\n s\n-1\n were used in the 148 \ncalculations.  However, the vertical eddy viscosity, assumed to be of tidal origin was varied 149 \nbetween calculations (see Table 1) in order to determine its influence on bottom boundary 150 \nthickness and hence lee wave generation and mixing, as identified by Ri number distributions.  151 \nConsequently mixing was mainly controlled by small scale processes that could be resolved 152 \non the grid, and high mixing regions identified by low Richardson number values. 153 \n At sea surface and sea bed, a no flux boundary condition was applied together with a 154 \nzero surface stress condition and quadratic friction at the bed.  A time step dt = 2s, was used 155 \nin all calculations.  At the western open boundary barotropic tidal forcing corresponding to an 156 \nexternal M2 tide was applied of the form  157 \n 8 \nU = F(t)Uocos \u03c9t 158 \nWhere Uo is tidal amplitude and \u03c9 its period with F(t) increases exponentially from 0 to 1 at t 159 \ngreater that 0.25 of an M2 tidal period.  By this means tidal forcing was gradually increased at 160 \nthe open boundary. 161 \n3. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS 162 \n3.1 Narrow Sill Calculations 163 \n(a) k = 0.0025, Av = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n 164 \n In an initial calculation (Calc 1, Table 1) the water depth h = 100 m, with sill depth hs 165 \n= 15 m, and hence sill height ho = 85 m.  The sill half width as = 500 m.  The initial vertical 166 \nvariation of temperature is as shown in Fig. 1a, giving a constant buoyancy frequency N = 167 \n0.01 s\n-1\n.  The value of bottom friction coefficient k = 0.0025, with Kv, Ah, Kh values as given 168 \nin Section 2, and Av = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n (Table 1).  These parameters are typical of sill regions and 169 \nwere used in the Loch Etive calculations (XD06) where they yielded results in good 170 \nagreement with observations (Inall et al., 2004, 2005).  In all calculations the model started 171 \nfrom a state of rest with horizontal isotherms and a vertical temperature gradient (Fig. 1a).  172 \nTidal forcing was introduced through the left open boundary with Uo = 0.15 m s\n-1\n.  The right 173 \nhand boundary (head of the loch) was closed.  As a detailed description of tidal flow over 174 \nsills and small scale topography is given in XD06, with an intercomparison with appropriate 175 \nobservations (Inall et al., 2005, 2006), only the major features are presented here, at the end 176 \nof the first cycle (Fig. 2a) and second cycle (Fig. 2b). 177 \n Initially tidal flow through the left open boundary causes isotherms to rise on the left 178 \nhand side of the sill.  Based on the water depth away from the sill, h = 100 m, maximum 179 \ninput tidal velocity Uo = 0.15 m s\n-1\n, and buoyancy frequency N = 0.01 s\n-1\n, the Froude number 180 \naway from the sill, Fr = Uo\/hN = 0.15 is sub-critical (namely Fr < 1).  However, as the water 181 \nover the sill accelerates, by t = 8\/8T (where T is a tidal cycle) it reaches a sill velocity U s = 182 \n 9 \n0.35 m s\n-1\n (Fig. 2a).  Also the sill water depth is 15 m, giving a sill Froude number Fs = 183 \nUs\/hsN = 2.3, namely a super-critical flow.  However, on right side of the sill, the water is at 184 \nrest and the flow is sub-critical.  Hence a hydraulic transition occurs on the lee side of the sill 185 \nwith an associated downwelling of the isotherms.  This gives rise to the production of a 186 \ntemperature gradient with associated internal waves (Fig. 2a).  At the end of the first tidal 187 \ncycle, namely t = 8\/8T, the initial hydraulic transition has been advected downstream by the 188 \nflow. 189 \n Vertical velocity contours on the leeside of the sill at this time show the presence of 190 \nlee waves, with wavelengths of order 100 m.  This wavelength is comparable to those 191 \nobserved on the lee side of sills with similar topography (see Inall et al., 2004, 2005) and 192 \nfound in models of sill regions (e.g. XD06, DX07, Vlasenko et al 2005).  Associated with the 193 \nlee waves are regions of enhanced\/reduced u velocity, giving rise to an increase\/decrease in 194 \nthe U velocity on the lee side of the sill as shown in Fig. 2a.  During flood tide, the lee waves 195 \nare trapped on the lee side of the topography and their amplitude increases.  Associated with 196 \nthe lee waves, and the current jet that separates from the top of the sill (Fig. 2a), are regions 197 \nof convective overturning and shear induced mixing giving rise to negative Richardson 198 \nnumbers, and values below the critical Richardson number Ric = 0.25 (Fig. 2c).  In these 199 \nregions there is significant vertical mixing as shown by the isotherms (Fig. 2c).  As tidal 200 \nvelocity decreases lee waves that were trapped on the leeside of the topography propagate 201 \ntowards the sill, but in the case of a shallow sill they cannot propagate over it, and energy is 202 \nlost due to enhanced mixing on the lee side of the topography.  A detailed discussion of this 203 \nis beyond the scope of the present paper, but given in XD06.  However, the main features of 204 \nthe across sill flow can be appreciated from the time series at x = 0 (centre of the sill) given 205 \nin Fig. 3a. 206 \n 10 \n Time series of temperature and velocity profiles from x = 0 show (Fig. 3a) the 207 \nvelocity increasing during the \u201cramp-up\u201d stage (up to t = 0.25T).  This produces an upwelling 208 \nof isotherms on the top of the sill with an associated decrease in temperature in the near bed 209 \nregion.  As the tide reverses the hydraulic transition formed on the lee side of the sill is 210 \nadvected back over the sill producing the rapid temperature change at about t = 0.3T (Fig. 211 \n3a).  The symmetric nature of the topography means that a corresponding hydraulic transition 212 \nis formed on the left hand side, and is also advected by the flow.  It is evident from Fig. 3a, 213 \nthat a periodic flow dominated by the M2 period, although with some higher harmonic, as 214 \nshown by the two maxima\/minima per tidal cycle, is rapidly established after the first tidal 215 \ncycle.  Although there is no evidence of lee wave advection or propagation onto the sill, time 216 \nseries of temperature, u and w- velocity at x = 500m, show a significant lee wave signal on 217 \nthe lee side of the sill as the tide floods (Fig. 3b). 218 \n As time progresses, lee waves on the lee side of the sill give rise to some mixing in 219 \nthis region (Fig. 2b) (although some of this can be due to the intrusion of water advected over 220 \nthe sill) producing a reduction in the intensity of the hydraulic transition.  Consequently the 221 \nsharpness and form of the hydraulic transition is reduced with time as shown by the time 222 \nseries of the temperature field in Fig. 3a, as a progressively more diffuse temperature front 223 \nformed in the lee of the topography is advected over the sill. 224 \n After two tidal cycles (t = 16\/8T) the vertical and horizontal extent of the well mixed 225 \nregion on the lee side of the topography has increased.  In addition the upper water column 226 \nstratification down stream of the hydraulic transition has weakened.  The reduction in 227 \nstratification on the lee side of the topography that occurred during the first tidal cycle, means 228 \nthat the buoyancy frequency in the sill region (Ns) has changed giving rise to an increase in 229 \nlee wave magnitude as shown by the vertical velocity contours (Fig. 2b).  As the influence of 230 \nbuoyancy frequency on the lee side of topography is discussed in detail in DX07 it is not 231 \n 11 \nconsidered here.  However, the extent to which changes in k and Av influence the mixing and 232 \nhence the spectrum of the internal tide and lee waves is examined here and quantified in 233 \nterms of the depth integrated power spectrum of the vertical velocity after 8 tidal cycles (Fig. 234 \n4a). 235 \n It is evident from Fig. 4a, that the power spectrum exhibits distinct peaks at the M2, 236 \nM4, M6 and M8 frequencies, showing that a significant M2 internal tide has been generated, 237 \nwith non-linear effects producing higher tidal harmonics.  In addition there is a peak at the 238 \nhigh frequency end of the spectrum, namely at a period of about 12 mins, which is 239 \ncharacteristic of lee waves generated over topography of the scale used here with a buoyancy 240 \nfrequency Ns = 0.01 s\n-1\n.  Based on simple theory for Ns = 0.01 s\n-1\n, a lee wave period of about 241 \n2\u03c0\/Ns = 10 mins would be expected.  This is close to that found in the model, which takes 242 \naccount of mixing in the sill region and hence a change in N.  Above the lee wave frequency, 243 \nenergy decreases as frequency increases. 244 \n(b) k = 0.025, Av = 0.001m\n2\n s\n-1\n 245 \n In order to examine the influence of bottom friction and hence stress at the bottom of 246 \nthe turbulent bottom boundary layer, upon lee wave formation, mixing and internal wave 247 \nspectrum, the previous calculation was repeated with k = 0.025 (Calc 2).  Increasing the 248 \nbottom drag coefficient, leads to a reduction in bottom current on top of the sill, although 249 \nthere is a slight increase in the surface current (compare u current contours at t = 8\/8T in Figs. 250 \n2a and 5a).  Although this change in current profile and magnitude is small, it does influence 251 \nthe intensity of the hydraulic transition on the lee side of the sill and hence the mixing in this 252 \nregion.  This is clearly evident in the differences in isotherm and Ri number distributions 253 \nbetween Calcs 1 and 2 (compare Figs. 2c and 5c).  It is evident from Figs. 2c and 5c that the 254 \nvertical extent of the well mixed region has been reduced, although its lateral extent is 255 \n 12 \nincreased by this increase in k.  This is associated with the increase in lee wave intensity and 256 \ndownstream extent, together with the u component of current due to this increase in k. 257 \n As discussed in connection with Calc 1, changes in mixing and hence N on the lee 258 \nside of the topography, influences lee wave production in such regions and hence subsequent 259 \nmixing.  Consequently this short term change in mixing accumulates in the longer term, and 260 \nis clearly evident in the differences in isotherm distributions at t = 16\/8T (compare Figs. 2b 261 \nand 5b). 262 \n Although the power spectrum for the two cases (Figs. 4a and 4b) show similar 263 \ndistributions of energy across the frequency band, a detailed examination suggested that the 264 \nenergy in the lee wave band had increased, with an associated reduction in the tidal band, as k 265 \nhad increased.  Additional calculations (not presented) showed that as k decreased so did 266 \nenergy in the lee wave band, although the dominant features of the spectrum were consistent 267 \nwith those shown in Figs. 4a,b. 268 \n(c) k = 0.0025, Av = 0.005 m\n2\n s\n-1\n (Calc 3) 269 \n To examine the influence of vertical eddy viscosity, and hence enhanced turbulence in 270 \nthe near bed region, Calc 1 was repeated with Av increased to Av = 0.005 m\n2\n s\n-1\n (Calc 3).  271 \nThis increase in Av is assumed to arise through an increase in tidal turbulence produced by a 272 \nrougher sea bed in the sill region.  Measurements (Moum and Nash, 2000) suggest that bed 273 \nroughness with associated enhanced turbulence arise in sill regions due to the stronger 274 \ncurrents over the sill crest.  As in Calcs 1 and 2, a hydraulic transition develops on the lee 275 \nside of the topography (Fig. 6a) although the intensity and downstream extent of the mixing 276 \nare significantly reduced compared to Calcs 1 and 2, compare Figs 2a, 5a and 6a.  This is due 277 \nto a reduction in lee wave intensity as shown by the reduction in magnitude of the vertical 278 \nvelocity associated with the lee waves (see Figs 2a and 6a).  The associated reduction in 279 \nmixing due to decreased lee wave activity means that the buoyancy frequency in the region of 280 \n 13 \nthe sill is maintained close to its initial value, unlike in Calc 1 where lee wave intensity and 281 \nmixing increase with time.  Consequently at t = 16\/8T the mixed region (not shown) is 282 \nsubstantially less than found at this time in Calc 1.  The reduction in mixing between the 283 \npresent calculation and Calc 1, is evident in the reduced intensity and lateral extent of the 284 \nregion where Ri is below its critical value of 0.25 (compare Figs. 6b and 2c). 285 \n Time series of temperature and velocity from the centre of the sill (Fig. 6c) over the 286 \nfirst two tidal cycles, show similar current magnitude and time variations to those found with 287 \nAv = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n.  However, the effect of increasing Av has been to slightly reduce vertical 288 \nshear particularly in the near bed region, although there is no significant change in across sill 289 \nvelocity and hence sill Froude number Fs.  Despite the fact that Fs is the same in both 290 \ncalculations, it is apparent from the temperature time series at x = 0 (compare Figs. 3a and 291 \n6c) that after the \u201cspin up\u201d period there has been appreciably more mixing in Calc 1, than the 292 \npresent calculation.  As discussed previously this mixing is associated with lee waves 293 \ngenerated on the lee side of the sill.  Differences in the intensity of these lee waves and the 294 \nassociated level of mixing is evident from the comparison of time series at x = 500 m (Figs. 295 \n3b and 6d) that show a significant reduction in lee wave intensity when Av is increased. 296 \n Although Fig. 6d shows that the magnitude of the lee waves at x = 500 m has been 297 \nreduced, the power spectra (Fig. 4c) reveals that besides this reduction across the lee wave 298 \nband, the distribution of energy across the band has changed (compare Figs. 4a and 4c).  In 299 \nessence because the mixing has been reduced, the buoyancy frequency has remained more 300 \nconstant in time and energy has been retained (although reduced) at the dominant lee wave 301 \nfrequency (determined by buoyancy frequency, for fixed topography and forcing frequency) 302 \n(Fig. 4c) rather than spread over the band (Fig. 4a).  The change in mixing in the sill region as 303 \nto be expected also influences the energy in the internal tide at this location.  Since the 304 \nintensity and location of internal tide generation along a slope, together with its propagation 305 \n 14 \naway from its generation point changes with buoyancy frequency (for a given topography, 306 \nforcing and Coriolis frequency) then changes in mixing will also affect the low frequency 307 \ninternal tide end of the spectrum. 308 \n(d) k = 0.0025, Av = 0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n (Calc 4) 309 \n Increasing Av to Av = 0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n significantly reduces the magnitude of the hydraulic 310 \ntransition and the downstream extent of the well mixed region (Fig. 7a).  The magnitude of 311 \nthe maximum across sill velocity is slightly reduced by about 5 cm s\n-1\n (Figs. 7a,b), although 312 \nthe sill Froude number remains supercritical (Fs = 2).  Contours of w (not presented) show 313 \nweak lee waves close to the topography on its downstream side.  Time series of temperature 314 \nand velocity from x = 0 (Fig. 7b) show that the effect of further increasing the vertical eddy 315 \nviscosity compared with previously is to slightly reduce the shear in the bottom boundary 316 \nlayer, with the current exhibiting a near linear decrease from surface to bed. 317 \n However, the magnitude of the current above this layer is not significantly affected 318 \nnor is its time variation.  Consequently as discussed previously, Fs is supercritical and a 319 \nhydraulic transition is formed and advected across the sill (Fig. 7b).  Unlike previously (Calc 320 \n1) the absence of significant lee waves downstream of the sill means that there is little mixing 321 \nin this region.  Consequently the generation and advection of the temperature front is a 322 \npersistent feature of the tidal flow over the sill and a clear indicator of the absence of lee 323 \nwave mixing. 324 \n Comparing power spectra at x = 500 m from this calculation (Calc 4) (Fig. 4d, Av = 325 \n0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n) with earlier calculations (Fig. 4a, Av= 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n) and Fig. 4c (Av=0.005 m\n2 \ns\n-1\n), 326 \nit is clearly evident that energy at the high frequency end of the spectrum has been 327 \nsignificantly reduced due to this additional increase in Av.  In addition internal tide generation 328 \nhas been suppressed, as indicated by the lack of peaks at the low frequency end of the 329 \nspectrum. 330 \n 15 \n This series of calculations shows that the value of vertical eddy viscosity and hence 331 \nturbulence in the tidal bottom boundary layer has a significant influence upon lee wave 332 \ngeneration and hence mixing on the lee side of shallow topographic features.  In reality tidal 333 \nturbulence (and hence tidally induced viscosity) depends on tidal velocity and bed roughness.  334 \nConsequently in shallow regions such as sills it is appreciable and will play a role in 335 \ndetermining the intensity of lee wave generation and associated mixing. 336 \n4. INFLUENCE OF WATER DEPTH 337 \n In this calculation (Calc 5) the water depth outside the sill region was reduced to 50 m 338 \n(Fig. 1b).  This value was chosen because it corresponded to the depth at which the flow in 339 \nprevious calculations was non-zero.  Hence bottom frictional effects away from the top of the 340 \nsill, which were previously zero, are now non-zero.  In addition to maintain the same sill 341 \nprofile near its top and identical stratification in this region, the initial conditions were as 342 \npreviously, but with the sea bed now at z = -50 m (Fig. 1b).  In order to maintain the same sill 343 \nFroude number, the amplitude of the forcing velocity was reduced to 0.18 m s\n-1\n, a value that 344 \ngave an across sill flow comparable to that used earlier. 345 \n(a) k = 0.0025, Av = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n, h = 50 m (Calc 5) 346 \n In an initial calculation (Calc 5) with h = 50 m, values of k and Av were as in Calc 1.  347 \nContours of u current velocity in the sill region at t = 8\/8T show (Fig. 8a) an across sill flow 348 \ncomparable to that found in Calc 1 (Fig. 2a) and hence the same sill Froude number Fs.  349 \nHowever, the temperature contours (Fig. 8a) at this time do not show the presence of the 350 \nsharp surface frontal feature found previously (Fig. 2a) at x = 800 m.  A well mixed region 351 \nand some convective overturning does exist on the lee side of the sill (Fig. 8a) although this is 352 \nappreciably less than previously (Fig. 2a).  Contours of vertical velocity (not presented) 353 \nreveal very little lee wave activity in the region at this time, unlike previously (Fig. 2a) and 354 \nhence away from the sill area, the u velocity shows a uniform variation with no indication of 355 \n 16 \npatches of enhanced velocity as found in Calc 1 (Fig. 2a) due to lee wave activity. However, 356 \nsubsequently (Fig 8b) some lee wave does develop at t=16\/8T (see later discussion). 357 \n The Ri number and isotherm distribution at t = 8\/8T (Fig. 8c) show a region of critical 358 \nRi number in the lee of the sill from about z = -15m to -40 m extending downstream to 359 \nbeyond x = 1000 m.  This is comparable to that found previously (Fig. 2c), although the 360 \nisotherms show the absence of lee waves.  This suggests that early in the calculation (first 361 \ntidal cycle) mixing is produced by the flow over the sill, rather than the lee waves that are 362 \ngenerated in the deep water case.  Also in this shallow water case there is some indication of 363 \nbottom mixing close to the sill. 364 \n After two tidal cycles (t = 16\/8T) (Fig. 8d) there is clear evidence of bottom mixing as 365 \nshown by the presence of two bed regions of critical Ri number, which are independent of the 366 \ncritical Ri number, higher in the water column.  Such separate areas were not found in the 367 \ndeep water calculations (Fig. 2d).  As time progresses, bottom generated turbulence and 368 \nmixing increases, and in the region of the sill it extends into the mid-depth part of the water 369 \ncolumn (not shown). 370 \n Time series of temperature and velocity at x = 0 (the top of the sill) shows (Fig. 9a) 371 \nthat during the spin up period, (namely to t = 0.25T) comparable velocities and displacements 372 \nof the isotherms to those found previously occur (compare Figs. 3a and 9a).  However, after 373 \nthe first tidal cycle, when some lee waves are generated downstream of the sill as shown in 374 \nthe time series at x = 500 m (Fig. 9b), the across sill temperature and velocity time series is 375 \nappreciably different from the deeper water case (compare Figs. 3a and 9a).  The reason for 376 \nthis is that the duration and magnitude of the lee waves generated in the shallow case (Fig. 377 \n9b) is appreciably less than when h = 100 m (Fig. 3b). 378 \n Differences in the level of mixing and lee wave intensity between shallow and deeper 379 \nwater cases is evident from a comparison of Figs. 8b and 2b.  Although the sill depth hs 380 \n 17 \nacross sill velocity and sill Froude number Fs are the same with h = 50 m and 100 m, it is 381 \napparent that lee wave generation and associated mixing that occurs on the lee side of the sill 382 \nwhen h = 50 m (Fig. 8b), is appreciably less than when h = 100 m.  This suggests that the 383 \ncloser proximity of the sea bed to the top of the sill where the lee waves are generated, 384 \nreduces the amplitude of the lee wave.  This is confirmed by comparing power spectra from 385 \nthe h = 50 m calculation (Fig. 4e) with that determined with h = 100 m (Fig. 4a).  Although 386 \nthe low frequency end of the power spectrum are comparable; showing the presence of the 387 \nM2 internal tide and its higher harmonics, it is evident that there is no appreciable increase in 388 \npower at the high frequency end, corresponding to the generation of strong lee waves as 389 \nfound previously when h = 100 m (compare Figs. 4a and 4e).  This suggests that the decrease 390 \nin water depth and the proximity of the top of the sill to the viscous bottom boundary layer 391 \nsignificantly reduces lee wave generation and any associated mixing. 392 \n(b) k = 0.0025, Av = 0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n, h = 50 m (Calc 6) 393 \n To examine to what extent increasing vertical eddy viscosity to Av = 0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n in the 394 \nshallow water case influences lee wave generation and mixing, the previous calculation was 395 \nrepeated with this high Av value (Calc 6).  After the first tidal cycle, the distribution of 396 \nisotherms and u currents (not presented) showed a small hydraulic transition on the lee side 397 \nof the sill with a reduced level of mixing compared to Av = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n (Fig. 8a).  Vertical 398 \nvelocity contours (not presented) revealed a small lee wave signal downstream of the sill.  399 \n The mixed water region on the lee side of the sill increased with time (t = 16\/8T, Fig. 400 \n10a), although its downstream extent was reduced compared to previously (compare Figs. 401 \n10a and 8b).  This was due to the decrease in lee wave intensity and the lateral extent of the 402 \ndownstream region of significant lee wave activity (Fig. 10a).  This resulted in reduced 403 \nmixing due to lee waves in the downstream region because of the increase in Av, although the 404 \nregions of bottom and mid-water mixing close to the sill were no longer separate (compare 405 \n 18 \nFigs. 8d and 10b).  In essence as eddy viscosity is increased, the thickness of the bottom 406 \nturbulent Ekman layer is increased to such an extent that it overlaps the turbulent mid-water 407 \nregion.  The reduction in mid-water mixing due to the decrease in lee wave activity is 408 \nconfirmed by the time series of the isotherm distribution on the top of the sill (Fig. 10c).  409 \nComparison with Fig. 9a, clearly shows that although the time series are comparable during 410 \nthe \u201cspin up\u201d period, the broadening in time of the hydraulic transition and the vertical 411 \nweakening of the temperature gradient that occurs with Av = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n, does not arise 412 \nwhen Av = 0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n.  This result is comparable to that found in the deeper water case with 413 \nAv = 0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n, where the computed time series on top of the sill (Fig. 7b) shows similar 414 \nfeatures to that shown in Fig. 10c.  As in the deep water case, increasing Av from 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n 415 \nto 0.01 m\n2\n s\n-1\n, leads to a reduction in energy in the high frequency lee wave band of the 416 \nspectrum (compare Figs. 4e and 4f).  This confirms that irrespective of water depth, the value 417 \nof Av controls lee wave formation and the associated mixing. 418 \n(c) k = 0.0025, Av = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n, ho = 20 m, h = 100 m (Calc 7) 419 \n From the previous calculations it is evident that both Av values and proximity of the 420 \nsill top to the near bed region controls lee wave generation and associated mixing.  To 421 \ndetermine to what extent total water depth influences the solution when the sill top is close to 422 \nthe near bed region and hence the turbulent bottom boundary layer, Calc 5 was repeated with 423 \nho = 20 m, namely a small sill height close to the bed, but in a water depth of 100 m, hence hs 424 \n= 80 m. 425 \n To be consistent with Calc 5, and enable across sill flows to be compared when water 426 \ndepth changes from 50 m to 100 m, the input forcing was adjusted so that the maximum 427 \nacross sill velocity was comparable to that found in Calc 5 (namely 0.5 m s\n-1\n).  Although the 428 \nFroude number away from the sill Fr was comparable to that used previously, the increase in 429 \nhs while maintaining Us led to a decrease in Fs.  However, despite this lower value of Fs, 430 \n 19 \nsignificant lee waves were formed on the lee side of the sill as shown by the vertical velocity 431 \ncontours at t = 8\/8T (Fig. 11a).  This is in marked contrast to the lee wave distribution found 432 \nin Calc 5, where the water depth was only 50 m.  However, despite the larger lee wave signal 433 \nat this time there does not appear to be significant overturning and mixing in the water 434 \ncolumn compared to Calc 5 (compare isotherms in Figs. 8a and 11a).  In the present 435 \ncalculation mixing is mainly confined to the near bed region, as shown by the R i number 436 \ndistribution (Fig. 11b). 437 \n The increase in sill water depth means that lee waves and internal tides in the present 438 \ncalculation can propagate over the sill whereas in previous calculations the vertical velocity 439 \nover the sill was zero.  The time series of vertical velocity at x = 0 (centre of sill) clearly 440 \nshows (Fig. 12) a significant lee wave signal (period of order 12 mins) and internal tidal 441 \nsignal (period of order 12 hours).  These periods are also present in the time series of 442 \nisotherms and u-components of current.  Both the isotherms and u-currents show similar 443 \nlonger (of order hours) term variations to those found in the shallower water case (compare 444 \nFigs. 12 and 9a), with comparable maximum surface tidal velocities.  However, in the present 445 \ncalculation there is a significant lee-wave signal as the tide reverses due to lee waves being 446 \nadvected over the sill.  The advection of lee waves over the sill due to its increased depth 447 \ncompared to previously means that they do not break and contribute to mixing in the sill 448 \nregion.  However since they are generated close to the seabed (due to the small height of the 449 \ntopography) means that they are dissipated close to their generation point by bottom frictional 450 \neffects.  This leads to enhanced bottom mixing intensity downstream of the sill, compared to 451 \nthe higher sill case (compare Figs. 2c and 11b). 452 \n In previous calculations (Calcs 1 to 6), the sill depth hs = 15 m, was so shallow that 453 \npropagation or advection of internal waves over the sill could not occur.  Consequently the 454 \nvertical velocity on the sill top was zero.  In the present case with a deep sill the depth 455 \n 20 \nintegrated spectrum of the vertical velocity (Fig. 13a) based on the eight tidal cycle, showed 456 \nspikes at the M4, M8 and M16 signal, although there were dips at the M2, M6 and M12 457 \nfrequency.  This suggests that non-linear effects associated with such small scale topography 458 \nprimarily produce higher harmonics of the tide close to the sill, which in the case of deep 459 \nwater above the sill can propagate over it.  Certainly in the case of a shallow sill hs = 15 m, 460 \nno internal waves occurred on the top of the sill.  However, a detailed study of the influence 461 \nof sill depth hs upon internal wave propagation is beyond the scope of the present paper. 462 \n Although there is some energy at the lee wave frequency at the high frequency end of 463 \nthe spectrum, there is no distinct peak (Fig. 13a).  Similarly at x = 500 m the high frequency 464 \nend of the spectrum shows (Fig. 13b) a rapid fall off with frequency comparable to that found 465 \nwith h = 50 m (Fig. 4d).  However in the deeper water case there is increased energy at the 466 \nlow frequency (tidal band) of the spectrum. 467 \n These calculations suggest that when the top of the sill is close to the sea bed region, 468 \nthere is substantial mixing in the bottom boundary layer.  Increases in turbulence (Av) and 469 \nbottom friction in this region, giving a thicker turbulent bottom boundary layer, dissipate the 470 \nlee waves that are generated on the lee side of the sill.  In the case of shallow water depths 471 \nwhere the turbulent boundary layer can extend close to the sea surface (e.g. h = 50 m) the 472 \nwater on the lee side of the sill experiences enhanced mixing.  As water depth increases 473 \nalthough sill height ho remains small mixing in the bottom boundary layer is isolated from the 474 \nmain part of the water column, that remains stratified.  The effect of increasing water depth 475 \nalso means that for a fixed ho, sill depth hs increases and internal wave propagation over the 476 \nsill can occur, leading to a reduction of wave overturning and breaking and associated upper 477 \nwater column mixing found in the earlier calculations. 478 \n5. CONCLUDING REMARKS 479 \n 21 \n Earlier work (XD06, DX07) that was concerned with the role of small scale 480 \ntopography, such as localized ripples that are found on sills, or changes in vertical 481 \nstratification in sill regions, is extended here to examine the role of bottom turbulent mixing 482 \nof tidal origin, and water depth in the region of sills.  In particular the influence of enhanced 483 \nbed friction and associated turbulence due to changes in bed roughness reflecting differences 484 \nin bed types (e.g. sand or gravel) often found in sill regions is considered.  As bed roughness 485 \nincreases going from a sand to gravel regime so does bed turbulence, parameterized here in 486 \nterms of vertical eddy viscosity.  The effects of both changes in bed friction and vertical eddy 487 \nviscosity together with water depth upon mixing and internal wave generation were examined 488 \nin shallow sill regions.  Transfer of energy from the barotropic M2 tide into a spectrum of 489 \ninternal waves was quantified in terms of energy power spectra, with spatial distributions of 490 \nRi number and isotherms quantifying the degree of mixing. 491 \n In order to determine the influence of bottom friction coefficient, eddy viscosity and 492 \nwater depth, idealized sill topography representing a symmetric sill was used, rather than the 493 \nLoch Etive topography considered in XD06, DX07.  However the main features of the 494 \ntopography were such as to represent a sill in a Loch, or a small bank in a shallow sea region. 495 \n All calculations were performed using a cross sectional non-hydrostatic model, with 496 \nsinusoidal forcing at the M2 period.  The buoyancy frequency was fixed as was the sill 497 \ntopography, except when the water depth was changed, when the aspect ratio of the top of the 498 \nsill was maintained.  By this means changes in friction coefficient, eddy viscosity and water 499 \ndepth could be assessed, while maintaining the same sill Froude number Fs. 500 \n In an initial calculation water depth was 100 m, bottom friction k = 0.0025, with Av = 501 \n0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n typical values in sill regions (XD06).  Calculations showed a hydraulic transition 502 \nin the upper part of the water column, with lee waves and a current jet produced near the top 503 \nof the sill which was 85 m above the bed.  Away from the sill region there was no significant 504 \n 22 \nflow in the bottom half of the water column and hence bottom frictional effects had no 505 \ninfluence.  However over the sill top, currents were significant and bottom friction together 506 \nwith vertical eddy viscosity determined vertical shear in the current profile.  The shallow 507 \nnature of the sill (hs = 15 m) prevented internal waves propagating over the sill, and 508 \nsignificant internal mixing occurred on the downstream side of the sill at a depth below the 509 \nsurface approximately equal to the sill depth.  This mixing was clearly evident in the 510 \ndistribution of isotherms and Ri numbers downstream of the sill.  Although there was limited 511 \nbottom boundary layer mixing on top of the sill this was absent downstream of the sill.  512 \nInternal wave spectra downstream of the sill showed a strong lee wave signal and the 513 \npresence of an internal tide. 514 \n Increasing the bottom friction coefficient to k = 0.025, modified the current profile 515 \nover the sill due to bottom frictional effects.  This gave rise to a stronger lee wave signal and 516 \nincreased internal mixing on the lee side of the sill, although away from the sill the flow at 517 \ndepth and hence bottom mixing was zero.  Power spectra showed a slight reduction in 518 \ninternal tide generation with more energy in the high frequency lee wave part of the spectrum 519 \nand enhanced mixing. 520 \n Calculations showed that maintaining k at 0.0025, but increasing Av only slightly 521 \nmodified the across sill flow profile, namely a small reduction in bed shear.  However there 522 \nwas a significant reduction in the lee wave signal and hence internal mixing on the lee side of 523 \nthe sill.  As previously away from the sill, currents in the lower half of the water column and 524 \nhence bottom frictional effects and bottom mixing were zero.  Downstream of the sill, 525 \ninternal mixing was confined to the sill region and was weak. 526 \n Power spectra showed that as Av increased the energy in the lee wave band decreased.  527 \nInitially this decrease was greatest at frequencies removed from the dominant lee wave 528 \n 23 \nfrequency leading to a sharpening in the spectrum at this frequency.  However, as vertical 529 \nviscosity increased, energy in the lee wave band rapidly decreased. 530 \n These calculations in which the sill top was well removed from the sea bed, namely 531 \nsill height ho \u2248 h, clearly show that bottom boundary layer effects and mixing downstream of 532 \nthe sill were zero.  However bottom frictional effects and associated turbulence on the top of 533 \nthe sill were important, with vertical eddy viscosity influencing lee wave generation and 534 \nassociated internal mixing. 535 \n In subsequent calculations the water depth was reduced to h = 50 m while maintaining 536 \nthe sill depth at hs = 15 m and hence ho = 35 m.  In this case the top of the sill was close to the 537 \nseabed.  Calculations with k = 0.0025 and Av = 0.001 m\n2\n s\n-1\n, with Uo adjusted to give the 538 \nsame across sill velocity and hence sill Froude number Fs, as in the deep water case, showed 539 \nthat although the profile and magnitude of the across sill velocity were in good agreement 540 \nwith those used in the deep water case, lee wave generation was significantly reduced due to 541 \nthe decrease in water depth.  In addition the region of non-zero velocity now extended 542 \nthroughout the water column, and there was significant bottom mixing in the lee of the sill, 543 \nwhich extended throughout the water column, as shown in the Ri number distributions.  544 \nPower spectra did not show a peak at the lee wave frequency but a gradual decrease of energy 545 \nwith frequency suggesting significant mixing.  As in the deep water calculations, increasing 546 \nAv reduced shear in the bottom boundary layer on top of the sill, and reduced lee wave 547 \ngeneration.   548 \n These calculations clearly show that for the same across sill flow, and sill aspect ratio, 549 \nlee wave production on the lee side of the sill is reduced as water depth is decreased.  In 550 \naddition when the sill height ho is small there is significant bottom mixing downstream of the 551 \nsill.  In the case in which the water depth is comparable to ho, mixing in the downstream sill 552 \nregion extends throughout the water column.  However calculations in which ho was 553 \n 24 \ncomparable to the height of the bottom boundary layer, but the water was deep, suggested 554 \nthat mixing was confined to the bottom boundary layer with the water above this remaining 555 \nstratified.  In this case, namely ho < h and hs \u2248 h, internal waves could propagate over the sill, 556 \nand internal wave spectra from the sill top showed an appreciable internal tide signal in this 557 \nregion with some lee wave propagation over the sill.  In this case the lee wave propagated 558 \nover the sill rather than producing internal mixing that was near zero, while bottom mixing 559 \ndownstream of the sill was the main mixing agent.  The degree to which hs influences across 560 \nsill propagation of lee waves and hence internal mixing is beyond the scope of the present 561 \npaper but is being examined. 562 \n Calculations presented here clearly show that when ho is comparable to h, and exceeds 563 \nthe thickness of the turbulent bottom boundary layer, then for given N, values of k and Av 564 \n(which are related to bed roughness) on top of the sill will control internal mixing 565 \ndownstream of the sill.  In very shallow water the bed roughness and associated turbulence 566 \nboth on the sill and downstream of the sill are important in determining lee wave production 567 \nand sill mixing.  Consequently bed roughness and the associated turbulence in sill regions 568 \ntogether with velocity, stratification and detailed topography need to be measured in order to 569 \nprovide data sets for rigorous model validation.  In the case in which hs is sufficiently large to 570 \npermit internal wave propagation across the sill to occur, then internal wave measurements 571 \nboth on top of the sill besides on its leeward side are required. 572 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 573 \n The authors are indebted to L.
