INTRODUCTION\nIn the nuclear shell model, deeply bound states are usually\npictured as being fully occupied by nucleons. For those nu-\ncleon states in the vicinity of the Fermi surface, configuration\nmixing leads to a gradual decrease in the associated occupation\nnumbers. Correlations arising from short-range, soft-core,\nand tensor nucleon-nucleon (NN ) interactions and from\nlonger-range couplings that involve low-lying as well as giant\nresonance collective excitations result in a further reduction\nof the physical nucleon occupancies of states near the Fermi\nsurface, the associated single-particle strength being shifted\ninto a large number of states at higher energies [1\u20133]. Such\ncorrelation effects are taken into account only approximately\nin truncated-model-space effective-interaction theories such as\nthe shell model.\nWe note that the occupancy of a given state is not an\nexperimental observable. However, these correlation effects\nare reflected in the distribution of the single-particle spec-\ntroscopic strengths. This can be quantified by calculations\nof the spectroscopic factors C2S and measurements of direct\nreaction cross sections to given states. Novel measurements of\nnucleon single-particle strengths can thus be used to quantify\nthe role of correlations. The most quantitative body of data\non nucleon strength functions has come from studies of\nelectron-induced proton knockout reactions, (e, e\u2032p) [1,4]. It\nwas shown that, in stable nuclei across the nuclear chart, the\nspectroscopic strengths of valence proton states are reduced\nby factors Rs \u2248 0.6\u20130.7 relative to the expectations of the\nextreme independent-particle model. The correlations are thus\nrevealed as a suppression of the experimental cross sections\ncompared to those based on a dynamical reaction model and\nan associated nuclear structure model spectroscopic factor.\nThe latter determines the parentage in the initial state of\nthe projectile (with A nucleons) of a specific final-state\nconfiguration of a mass A \u2212 1 residue coupled to a nucleon\nwith quantum numbers (\u0001, j ) [5]. Information from the (e, e\u2032p)\nreaction is currently restricted to proton spectroscopic factors\nand to stable nuclei.\nOne-nucleon knockout reactions from intermediate-energy\nprojectile beams have already shown an outstanding ability to\nprovide precise spectroscopic information on the dominant\nproton and neutron single-particle structures of short-lived\nisotopes far from the valley of \u03b2 stability [6,7]. First employed\nto study halo systems [8\u201310], subsequent analyses have used\nthis experimental approach to deduce spectroscopic factors\nof individual single-particle states in many cases [5,11\u201316].\nIn so doing, nucleon knockout reactions have contributed to\nthe clarification of the evolution of shell structure toward the\nnucleon drip lines, helping to unravel the disappearance of\nfamiliar magic numbers and the formation of new shell gaps\nin nuclei with extreme N : Z ratios [17\u201322].\nAt beam energies of 50 MeV\/nucleon and higher a\ntheoretical description of the reaction dynamics using the\neikonal and the sudden approximations is both appropriate\nand accurate. There is also a much-reduced model (parameter)\ndependence compared to analyses of low-energy transfer\nreactions, e.g., (p, d) and (d,3He), whose computation relies\non the distorted-waves Born approximation (DWBA) or\nhigher-order formalisms that depend quite sensitively on the\noptical model and bound-state potentials used in the entrance\nand exit channels [23]. Such transfer reaction sensitivity\nis illustrated, for example, by the analyses of Lee et al.\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(4)\/044306(10) 044306-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nA. GADE et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 044306 (2008)\n[24,25]. There, depending on the analysis methodology, the\nbenchmark Rs \u2248 0.6\u20130.7 reduction from the (e, e\u2032p) reactions\nis reproduced (when using a theoretically consistent set of\npotential geometries) [24] or is not reproduced (when using a\nglobal\/generic parameter set) [24,25].\nWe note that those observables, measured using hadronic\nreactions, that probe aspects of the spatial behavior and sizes of\nthe nucleonic wave functions are generally in good agreement\nwith the shell-model picture. Examples are the particle\nangular distributions measured in transfer reactions and the\nlongitudinal momentum distributions of the projectile-like\nresidues measured in heavy-ion induced knockout reactions,\nboth of which identify the orbital angular momentum \u0001 of the\nsingle-particle states involved.\nAlthough the first spectroscopic results from heavy-ion-\ninduced single-nucleon knockout from well-bound nuclei were\nin line with those found elsewhere [5,14], the reduction\nfactors for the weakly bound protons in 8B and 9C [26]\nand the weakly bound neutron in 15C [16] were close to\nunity, the first indication of a dependence of the reduction\non the nucleon separation energy. To probe the analogous\nspectroscopy of a very strongly bound state, the 9Be(32Ar,\n31Ar)X one-neutron knockout reaction, leading to the only\nbound state \u2014 the 5\/2+ ground state \u2014 of a nucleus at the\nproton drip line, was performed [15]. The reaction was found\nto proceed at a cross section of 10.4(13) mb, translating into\na spectroscopic strength that accounts for only 24(3)% of\nthat predicted by the shell model. It was suggested that this\nmay indeed reflect enhanced correlation effects, absent from\nthe underlying effective-interaction theory, linked to the large\nasymmetry in the Fermi energies of the neutron and proton\nstates in nuclei near the drip lines [15]. Recent theoretical\nwork, involving a dispersive optical model analysis of nucleon\nelastic scattering data [27], also indicates that nucleons of\nthe deficient species will become more strongly correlated\nwith increasing asymmetry, whereas the opposite holds for the\nnucleons of the excess species, in qualitative agreement with\nthe observations reported above [15].\nNuclear systems with a significant nucleon asymmetry and\nconsequent Fermi surface asymmetry can be found along\nthe proton drip line. There, the valence protons are weakly\nbound and the valence neutrons are strongly bound. In 28S, for\nexample, the relevant separation energies are Sp = 2.50 MeV\nand Sn = 21.54 MeV. Studies of nucleons near these two,\ndisplaced Fermi surfaces is an experimental option that is\nunique to rare-isotope beam facilities. In addition, rare-\nisotopes produced as fast projectile beams allow the use of\nthick reaction targets and lead to viable experiments at rates\nof just a few ions per second.\nIn the present article we extend the systematics on the mea-\nsured spectroscopic strengths at the extreme values of nuclear\nbinding. The reactions 9Be(28S,27P)X and 9Be(24Si,23Al)X\nare used to probe the weakly bound proton states and the\nreactions 9Be(28S,27S)X and 9Be(24Si,23Si)X to probe the\nstrongly bound neutron states. These reactions are particularly\nwell suited because (i) weakly and strongly bound states are\nprobed in the same nucleus and (ii) the knockout residues are\nlocated close to the proton drip line and have only one or at\nmost two final states bound against proton emission.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe projectile beams of 24Si and 28S were each obtained\nby fragmentation of a 150 MeV\/nucleon 36Ar primary beam\nprovided by the Coupled Cyclotron Facility at the National Su-\nperconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) on the campus\nof Michigan State University. The 9Be fragmentation target\nof thickness 893 mg\/cm2 was located at the midacceptance\ntarget position of the A1900 fragment separator [28]. A\n300-mg\/cm2-thick achromatic aluminum wedge degrader and\nmomentum slits at the dispersive image of the fragment\nseparator were employed to purify the beams. 24Si was the most\nexotic constituent of a cocktail beam of N = 10 isotones of F,\nNe, Na, Mg, Al, and Si; 28S was the most exotic constituent of\na cocktail beam of N = 12 isotones of Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, and\nS. These secondary beams contained 0.50% 24Si and 0.74%\n28S, respectively.\nA 188(4)-mg\/cm2-thick 9Be knockout target was placed at\nthe reaction target position of the S800 spectrograph [29] and\nsurrounded by SeGA (Segmented Germanium Array), a highly\nsegmented germanium detector array optimized for in-beam\n\u03b3 -ray spectroscopy with fast exotic beams [30]. Its high degree\nof segmentation allows an accurate event-by-event Doppler\nreconstruction of the \u03b3 rays emitted by the reaction residues\nin-flight, where the emission angle entering the Doppler\nreconstruction is derived from the location of the detector\nsegment that registered the largest energy deposition. Sixteen\nof the SeGA detectors were arranged around the target in two\nrings with central angles of 90\u25e6 (nine detectors) and 37\u25e6 (seven\ndetectors) relative to the beam axis.\nIdentification of the projectile-like reaction residues emerg-\ning from the target was performed with the focal-plane detector\nsystem of the large-acceptance S800 spectrograph [29]. The\nenergy loss measured in the S800 ionization chamber, time-\nof-flight (TOF) taken between timing scintillators and the\nposition and angle information of the reaction products in\nthe focal plane of the spectrograph were utilized to identify\nthe reaction residues unambiguously on an event-by-event\nbasis. The spectrograph was operated in focus optics mode,\nwhere the incoming radioactive beam is focused in momentum\nat the spectrograph\u2019s reaction target position. The time-of-\nflight, measured between two plastic scintillators before the\nknockout target, provided the particle identification of the\nincoming beam (see Fig. 1 and Ref. [31]). Software gates\napplied on the incoming projectiles (Fig. 1, left) allowed for a\nclean separation between the knockout residues (Fig. 1, right)\nof interest and the fragmentation products of the different\nconstituents of the cocktail beams.\nThe two position-sensitive cathode readout drift counters\n(CRDCs) of the S800 focal-plane detection system in conjunc-\ntion with the optics code COSY [32] were used to reconstruct the\nlongitudinal momentum distribution of the knockout residues\nevent by event. For each reaction, the inclusive cross sections\nfor the one-nucleon knockout to all bound final states, \u03c3inc,\nis determined from the yield of detected knockout residues\ndivided by the number of incoming projectiles relative to\nthe number density of the 9Be knockout target. A detailed\ndiscussion of the cross sections, the residue momentum\ndistributions, and the experimentally deduced spectroscopic\nstrengths will be presented in Sec.

The gaps in this identification matrix correspond to the missing\nspecies 19Na and 16,15F, which are already beyond the proton dripline.\n(c) Same as (a) in coincidence with the 23Si one-neutron knockout\nresidues as identified in (d). It is apparent that with a gate condition\nas indicated by the dashed lines 23Si reaction residues produced by\n24Si are cleanly selected.\nIII. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION\nIn one-nucleon knockout reactions, a single nucleon is\nremoved from near the surface of the fast-moving projectile\nby the light target nucleus, here 9Be. The reaction theory\nis formulated using the sudden and eikonal approximations\n[6,33]. The applicability of the eikonal approximation is linked\nnot only to the high beam energy but also to this surface\nand small-angle forward scattering dominance of the reaction\nmechanism [7]. Surface selectivity is ensured by the highly\nabsorptive nature of the residue-target optical potential at the\nenergies under discussion. This surface dominance removes\nambiguities associated with (a) the single-nucleon motion and\n(b) the exit and entrance channel interactions in the nuclear\ninterior, resulting in a much reduced model dependence.\nThe cross section \u03c3 (j\u03c0 ) for the removal of a single nucleon\nwith quantum numbers (\u0001, j ) from the 0+ ground state of\nan even-even nucleus, thus leaving the knockout residue in a\nspecific final state j\u03c0 with excitation energy Ex[j\u03c0 ], is\n\u03c3 (j\u03c0 ) =\n(\nA\nA \u2212 1\n)2\nC2S(j\u03c0 )\u03c3sp(j, SN + Ex[j\u03c0 ]). (1)\nHere, the sum SN + Ex[j\u03c0 ] is the effective separation energy\nof the removed nucleon and SN is the ground-state-to-ground-\nstate nucleon separation energy. The A-dependent term is\nthe required center-of-mass correction to the shell-model\nspectroscopic factors C2S that is appropriate for the sd shell\n(the n = 2 major oscillator shell). The single-particle cross\nsection \u03c3sp is the sum of contributions from both the stripping\nmechanism (with excitation of the target by the removed\nnucleon) and the diffractive breakup mechanism (where the\ntarget remains in its ground state), written as \u03c3sp = \u03c3 strsp + \u03c3 difsp .\nFollowing Refs. [6,33], these stripping and diffractive con-\ntributions are computed independently from the residue- and\nnucleon-target elastic eikonal S matrices. These are expressed\nas functions of their respective impact parameters. They are\ncalculated using the double- and single-folding optical limit\nof Glauber\u2019s multiple scattering theory, respectively [34]. The\nion-ion, residue-target interactions used the point proton and\nneutron densities of the residue as input, the densities being\ntaken from Skyrme (SkX) Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations\n[35]. The 9Be density was assumed to be a Gaussian with\na root-mean-squared (rms) radius of 2.36 fm. This formalism\nfor treating the nucleon, residue, and target three-body system\nincludes the effects of the breakup of the projectile to all orders,\nsee, e.g., Refs. [6,33].\nGiven these residue- and nucleon-target interactions, the\nremaining ingredient to the reaction dynamics is the removed-\nnucleon radial overlap or bound-state wave function. As we\nnow show, we must specify consistently the rms radius rsp\nof this overlap \u2014 that is, the rms radius of the single-nucleon\nwave function.\nFigure 2 shows the single-particle cross sections \u03c3sp calcu-\nlated for both 1d5\/2 neutron- (circles) and 1d5\/2 proton-removal\n(squares) from the 24Si beam at 85.3 MeV\/nucleon populating\nthe 23Si and 23Al ground states. Each point on the figure\nuses different radius r0 and diffuseness a0 parameters in the\nWoods-Saxon potential well used to calculate the form factor.\nThese parameter values range over 1.1\u0001 r0 \u0001 1.4 fm and\n0.6\u0001 a0 \u0001 0.8 fm. The largest rsp cases also use a nonlocality\nparameter 0\u0001 \u03b2 \u0001 1.0. A spin-orbit interaction, with a fixed\nstrength of 6 MeV, and with the same (r0, a0) geometry, is\nadded in each case. Very evident is that the \u03c3sp are determined,\nto high precision, by the rsp value of the radial overlap, which\nmust now be assigned.\nIn our approach to determining the spectroscopic strengths,\nthe removed nucleon-residue relative motion wave functions\nand their rsp are also constrained, consistently, by the nuclear\nand single-particle orbital size systematics of HF calculations\nusing the Skyrme (SkX) interaction parametrization [35]. As\nwas just shown, the knockout cross section calculations are\nsensitive only to rsp and are otherwise insensitive to the shape\nof the binding potential over a large range of parameters.\n044306-3\nA.

(1) The bound-state wave functions were calculated\nin a Woods-Saxon potential with the depth V0 adjusted to\nreproduce the physical separation energy SN + Ex(j\u03c0 ) to each\nfinal state of interest. (2) The radius parameter r0 of this\npotential well is constrained by the rms radius of this orbital as\ngiven by the HF calculations, rHF. Specifically, we require that\nr0 generates a wave function with rsp = [A\/(A \u2212 1)]1\/2rHF\n[15] where this fit is made at the HF-predicted separation\nenergy. (3) Because of the insensitivity to other parameters\nwe use a fixed diffuseness parameter a0 = 0.7 fm and a\nspin-orbit interaction of 6 MeV with the same (r0, a0) as\nthe central potential. This consistent input, related to nuclear\nsize, is thus mandatory and is included for all of the systems\nstudied. We make use of the SkX Skyrme interaction as it\noffers good agreement with experiment for several observables\ndirectly related to the nuclear size in both stable and exotic\nnuclei. These include the binding energy differences of mirror\nnuclei [36], high-energy interaction cross sections [37], and\nnuclear charge distributions [38]. In Sec. IV C we will\ncompare our calculated results for several different Skyrme\nparametrizations.\nIn a limited way, we can also cross reference our procedure\nfor determining rsp with the values deduced (for even-even\nstable nuclei in a similar mass range) from (e, e\u2032p) reactions.\nThe r0 values used for the analyses of (e, e\u2032p) data are tabulated\nin Ref. [4]. For example, with the bound-states parameters,\nnonlocality, and potential conventions adopted there, the\nresulting rsp values for ground-state-to-ground-state (e, e\u2032p)\nknockout from 16O, 40Ca, and 48Ca are 2.954, 3.712, and\n2.8 2.9 3 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4\nrms radius rsp (fm)\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\nst\nr \/b\n2\n \n \n \n(m\nb)\na0=0.8 fm\na0=0.7 fm\na0=0.6 fm\n24 Si-1n\nFIG. 3.

The\ncalculations have been performed for a wide range of Woods-Saxon\ngeometries covering a broad range of neutron orbital rms radii. The\ngeometry adopted for our spectroscopic strength discussion is marked\nby the filled (red) circle. The filled squares and triangles (see the text)\ncorrespond to calculations that use nonzero, nonlocality parameters,\n\u03b2, in the potential. If the reaction calculations were sensitive only to\nthe asymptotic form of the wave functions, then the values of \u03c3 str\/b2\nwould be equal for all the potential points shown.\n3.58 fm, respectively. Based on the HF procedure discussed\nabove, we obtain the values 2.903, 3.670, and 3.56 fm, which\nare in rather good agreement with these cases. For 12C, which\nis rather light for the HF procedure to be expected to work\nwell, the values were 2.77 and 2.63 fm from Ref. [4] and the\npresent approach, respectively.\nFigure 3 shows, for the case of the neutron removal from\n24Si, the single-particle stripping cross section divided by the\nsquare of the asymptotic normalization constant (ANC), b2.\nThe results, for the wide range of Woods-Saxon potentials\nthat were shown in Fig. 2, are shown as a function of the rms\nradius of the neutron wave functions, rsp. The filled points are\nthe results for potentials with a nonlocality parameter \u03b2 > 0,\nspecifically, with 1.1\u0001 r0 \u0001 1.3 fm, a0 = 0.7 fm, \u03b2 = 1.0\n(filled triangles) and with 1.1\u0001 r0 \u0001 1.4 fm, a0 = 0.8 fm,\n\u03b2 = 0.5 (filled squares). Unlike simply changing the potential\ngeometry, these nonlocal cases exclude some of the wave\nfunction from the region of the binding potential and so\nalter the interior versus exterior content of the neutron wave\nfunction. As was discussed in connection with Fig. 2, these\nnonlocal variations agree with and lie on the (linear) \u03c3sp\nversus rsp systematics. As in Fig. 2, the solid circle shows the\nphysical values used here based on our SkX HF prescription.\nThat the knockout reaction cross section is sensitive to more\nthan the tail (the asymptotic form and the ANC) of the\nneutron wave functions is clear from the dependence of \u03c3 str\/b2\non the potential model assumed. This dependence shows a\ncomplex behavior with the radius, diffuseness, and nonlocality\nparameters. However, as was shown in Fig. 2, this reaction\n044306-4\nREDUCTION OF SPECTROSCOPIC STRENGTH: WEAKLY- . . .

The theoretical momentum distributions\nwere calculated following Refs. [39,40] using the same elastic\nS matrices as were used for the computation of the single-\nparticle cross sections. These theoretical shapes were folded\nwith the momentum profile of the unreacted projectile beam\npassing through the target to account for the spread in momenta\nimposed by (a) the momentum distribution in the incoming\nbeam, (b) its interaction with the target, and (c) the ion optics.\nThe spectroscopic factors C2S for the reactions studied\nwere calculated in the complete sd shell-model space. New\nHamiltonians have recently been obtained for the sd shell\n[41]. The USDA Hamiltonian was obtained by fitting the\n30 most well-determined linear combinations of two-body\nmatrix elements (tbme) and single-particle energies (spe) to\n77 ground-state binding energies and 530 excitation energies\nfor nuclei with proton and neutron number between 8 and\n20. The starting Hamiltonian as well as the one used for the\nremaining 46 linear combinations of tbme and spe was the\nrenormalized G matrix obtained from Bonn-A NN potential.\nThe rms deviation between experiment and theory was\n170 keV. Another Hamiltonian USDB was obtained by fitting\n56 linear combinations of tbme and spe with a resulting rms\ndeviation of 137 keV. Comparison of results obtained with\nUSDA and USDB provide a measure of the theoretical error\nassociated with the uncertainties in the sd-shell part of the\nHamiltonian. For the relatively large spectroscopic factors\nused in this work, the difference between USDA and USDB\nwas less than 5%; we use the values obtained from USDB for\nthe analysis [41]. All calculations were performed with the\ncomputer code OXBASH [42].\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Removal of weakly bound protons\nThe 9Be(24Si,23Al)X and 9Be (28S,27P)X one-proton knock-\nout reactions were performed to measure the single-particle\nstrengths of the weakly bound valence protons.\nThe 9Be(24Si,23Al)X reaction took place at 85.3 MeV\/u\nmidtarget energy. The slits in the A1900 fragment separator\nwere restricted to 0.5% total momentum acceptance for the\nprojectile beam. The inclusive cross section was measured\nfor several data runs and found to be constant within the\nstatistical uncertainty. The leftmost (low momentum) tail of\nthe longitudinal momentum distribution of the 23Al residues,\nreconstructed in the focal plane of the S800 spectrograph [see\nFig. 4(a)], was cut by the spectrograph\u2019s momentum accep-\ntance. A 1.8% correction for the missing counts was applied\nto the cross section. The inclusive cross section, including\nthis acceptance correction, amounts to \u03c3inc = 67.3(35) mb.\nA 5% systematic uncertainty, attributed to fluctuations in the\nincoming beam composition, was added in quadrature to the\nstatistical uncertainty.\nThe proton separation energy from 23Al is very low, at\nSp = 122(19) keV.

The relevant 1d5\/2 proton Woods-Saxon bound-state\nradius parameter is r0 = 1.189 fm, given that rHF = 3.444 fm.\nThe 24Si proton separation energy was Sp = 3.304 MeV. The\ncalculated single-particle cross section is then \u03c3sp = 22.74 mb,\nwith 17.56 and 5.18 mb attributed to the stripping and\ndiffraction mechanisms, respectively.\nThe USDB shell-model calculation predicts the ground-\nstate-to-ground-state spectroscopic factor to be C2S(5\/2+) =\n3.42. Using Eq. (1), this yields \u03c3 th = 84.7 mb to be compared\nto the experimental value of 67.3(35) mb and yields a reduction\nfactor Rs = \u03c3 exp\/\u03c3 th = 0.79(4). Figure 4(a) compares the\nmeasured 23Al residue longitudinal momentum distribution\nto the shape calculated for the removal of a proton from the\n1d5\/2 orbit, using the model of Refs. [39,40]. The agreement is\ngood and confirms the orbital angular momentum assignment\nfor the removed proton and the expectation that the measured\ninclusive cross section is exhausted by knockout to the ground\nstate of 23Al.\nThe 9Be(28S,27P)X reaction was performed at 80.7 MeV\/u\nat 1% incoming momentum spread of the projectile beam.\nThe inclusive cross section was measured for several data runs\nand found to be constant within the statistical uncertainty.\nHowever, during three normalization runs, the fraction of 28S\nin the incoming cocktail was found to change from 0.735 to\n0.818% and back to 0.751%. A composition change is not\nunusual in experiments with cocktail beams, especially when\nthe isotope of interest is the least abundant constituent, as\nin this case. This uncertainty in the normalization requires\nan 8.7% systematic uncertainty to be added in quadrature to\nthe statistical uncertainty. A momentum-acceptance correction\nof 1.78% has been applied to the inclusive cross section to\naccount for the finite momentum acceptance of the S800\nspectrograph and the loss of counts at the outermost tails\n044306-5\nA.

According to the shell model, one would expect 40%.\nThe discrepancy is most likely explained by the fact that this level is\nunbound by 260 keV and the \u03b3 -ray decay will be in strong competition\nwith proton emission. The 3\/2+ state was previously reported at\n1199 keV from particle spectroscopy [44].\n[see Fig. 4(b)]. The inclusive one-proton knockout cross\nsection to 27P, including the acceptance correction, statistical,\nand systematic uncertainties is \u03c3inc = 38(4) mb.\nThe USDB shell-model calculations (in agreement with\nthe mirror nucleus) predict a 27P first excited state with spin\nand parity 3\/2+ at 990 keV, just above the proton separation\nenergy of 861(27) keV [43]. However, in qualitative agreement\nwith the high 3\/2+ excitation energy reported in Ref. [44], we\nobserved a \u03b3 -ray transition at 1120(8) keV, attributed to the\nde-excitation of the first excited state to the 1\/2+ ground state.\nFigure 5 displays the \u03b3 -ray spectrum as detected in SeGA and\nevent-by-event Doppler reconstructed into the projectile rest\nframe.\nThe single-particle cross section for the knockout to the\n1\/2+ ground state of 27P required a bound-state potential\nwith r0 = 1.046 fm based on rHF = 3.895 fm. The ground-\nstate proton separation energy was Sp(28S) = 2.5 MeV [43].\nThe calculated single-particle cross section is then \u03c3sp =\n28.57 mb, with 20.73 and 7.84 mb attributed to the stripping\nand diffraction mechanisms. The one-proton removal cross\nsection to the 3\/2+ excited state used r0 = 1.239 fm, based\non rHF = 3.489 fm. The calculated 3\/2+ state single-particle\ncross section is then \u03c3sp = 19.01 mb.\nThe USDB shell-model calculations predict spectroscopic\nfactors of C2S(1\/2+) = 0.832 and C2S(3\/2+) = 0.820 for\nthese lowest-lying 1\/2+ and 3\/2+ states. So when combined\nwith the single- particle cross sections these yield a total\ntheoretical cross section of \u03c3 th = \u03c3 th(1\/2+) + \u03c3 th(3\/2+) =\n42.3 mb. When compared with the experimental inclusive\ncross section we obtain a reduction factor of Rs = 0.90(7).\nIn the future, threshold effects introduced by the proximity of\nthe particle continuum [45] might be taken into account within\nthe novel Gamow shell model [46] or other approaches that\nexplicitly treat the continuum [47\u201350].\nFrom the efficiency-corrected peak area of the \u03b3 -ray\ntransition at 1120 keV relative to the number of knockout\nresidues we determined the population of the 3\/2+ excited\nfinal state of 27P relative to the inclusive cross section to be\n18(3)%. This is to be compared to a theoretically predicted\npopulation of 40% from the combination of shell model and\nreaction theory. The lower measured branch is most likely\nattributed to a significant competition from proton decay\nof this state located at about 260 keV above the proton\nthreshold.\nThe experimental inclusive momentum distribution is\noverlaid with calculated \u0001 = 0 and \u0001 = 2 shapes in Fig. 4(b).\nThese \u0001 = 0 and \u0001 = 2 shapes have been scaled so that their\nintegrated values are in the ratio 20% \u0001 = 2 and 80% \u0001 = 0,\nas suggested from the experimental \u03b3 -ray yield.

Removal of strongly bound neutrons\nThe 9Be(24Si,23Si)X and 9Be(28S, 27S)X one-neutron\nknockout reactions were performed to measure the\nspectroscopic strengths for the removal of the strongly bound\nneutrons from these proton-excess nuclei.\nThe 9Be(24Si,23Si)X reaction was carried out at 85.3 MeV\/u\nmidtarget energy. The momentum acceptance of the A1900\nwas restricted to 0.5%. The data were divided up into clusters\ncovering about 4 h of run time each. The inclusive cross\nsection was determined cluster by cluster and found to be\nconstant within the statistical uncertainty. An inclusive cross\nsection of \u03c3inc = 9.8(10) mb was derived. The error includes a\n10% systematic uncertainty attributed to a possible acceptance\ncut, seen on the high-energy side of the parallel momentum\ndistribution in Fig. 4(c). Unlike the cases described in the\nprevious section, the distribution is seen to be asymmetric.\nNo \u03b3 -ray transition, which would indicate population of\nan excited state in 23Si, was observed. The first excited state\nof 23Si, with j\u03c0 = 1\/2+, is predicted to be at 1780 keV and\nso is probably above the proton separation energy of Sp =\n1700(220) keV. Unlike in 27P, where the 3\/2+ state above\nthe proton separation energy has orbital angular momentum\n\u0001 = 2 and its proton decay is thus hindered by the centrifugal\nbarrier, the excited state in 23Si has orbital angular momentum\n\u0001 = 0 and so its proton emission would not be hindered by a\ncentrifugal barrier.\nThe single-particle cross section for the population of\nthe 5\/2+ ground state was calculated using r0 = 1.317 fm,\nconsistent with the HF 1d5\/2 neutron orbital rms radius\nrHF = 3.237 fm. The neutron separation energy from 24Si\nwas Sn = 21.09 MeV [43]. The calculated stripping and\ndiffractive cross-section contributions were \u03c3 strsp = 10.96 mb\nand \u03c3 difsp = 2.47 mb, giving a theoretical single-particle cross\nsection of \u03c3sp = 13.43 mb to the ground state of 23Si.\nThe USDB shell-model calculations predict a spectroscopic\nfactor of C2S(5\/2+) = 1.71. This gives \u03c3 th = 25.01 mb, to\nbe compared to the experimental value of \u03c3inc = 9.8(10) mb.\nSimilar to the one-neutron removal from 32Ar to the ground\nstate of 31Ar [15], the result implies a strong reduction,\nwith Rs = 0.39(4). In Fig. 4(c) the experimental longitudinal\nmomentum distribution is compared to the calculation for the\nremoval of an \u0001 = 2 neutron from 24Si. The experiment and\ncalculations agree well except for the extreme high-momentum\ntail where the experimental distribution appears to be cut off.\nThe 9Be(28S,27S)X reaction was performed at 80.7 MeV\/u\nat 1% incoming momentum spread of the projectile beam.\nThe inclusive cross sections, measured for several data runs,\nwere constant within the statistical uncertainty. The measured\ninclusive cross section is \u03c3inc = 11.9(12) mb. Similar to the\none-neutron removal case above, a 10% systematic uncertainty\nwas added in quadrature to account for a possible acceptance\ncut seen on the high-energy side of the parallel momentum\ndistribution [Fig. 4(d)]. The absolute cross sections agree\nwithin 0.9% for two different normalization runs and hence no\nadditional systematic uncertainty was added for normalization\nof the incoming beam.\nTwo bound final states are expected in the 27S knock-\nout residue below the proton separation energy of Sp =\n720(280) keV, the 5\/2+ ground state and a 3\/2+ first excited\nstate. The USDB shell model predicts these states to be almost\ndegenerate. In the \u03b3 -ray spectrum, taken in coincidence with\n27S, a weak low-energy transition cannot be excluded but its\nidentification is obscured by background and hampered by low\nstatistics. As outlined below, this is consistent with the level\nordering proposed by the shell model.\nThe single-particle cross section for the knockout to the\n5\/2+ ground state was calculated with r0 = 1.308 fm for the\nneutron 1d5\/2 orbit, based on rHF = 3.300 fm. The ground-\nstate neutron separation energy was Sn = 21.54 [43]. This\ngives a single-particle cross section to the d5\/2 ground state\nof \u03c3sp(5\/2+) = 11.09 mb, with 8.99 and 2.10 mb attributed to\nstripping and diffraction. The single-particle cross section to\nthe 3\/2+ state was calculated in the same way, but with r0 =\n1.354 fm, giving \u03c3sp(3\/2+) = 10.75 mb, and with 8.72 and\n2.03 mb attributed to the stripping and diffraction mechanisms.\nThe USDB shell-model calculations predict C2S(5\/2+) =\n3.136 and C2S(3\/2+) = 0.119. Combining with the\nsingle-particle cross sections, \u03c3 th = \u03c3 th(5\/2+) + \u03c3 th(3\/2+) =\n38.77 mb with only 3.5% expected to populate the excited\nstate (consistent with its nonobservation in the experiment).\nA strong reduction factor Rs = \u03c3 exp\/\u03c3 th = 0.31(3) results. In\nFig. 4(d) the experimental longitudinal momentum distribution\nis again compared to a calculated shape for the removal\nof \u0001 = 2 neutrons, corresponding to knockout to both d5\/2\nand d3\/2 final states. Except for the high-momentum tail, the\ncalculation agrees well with the experiment, suggesting that\nonly the 3\/2+ and 5\/2+ states in 27S are populated. These\nexperimental and theoretical results are also collected in\nTable I. The 23Si(gs) single-particle cross section calculation\nis also shown by the (red) filled circle in Fig. 2.\nWe note that the high neutron separation energy involved\nin these cases does not influence on the underlying knockout\nreaction mechanism. This is unlike the situation in transfer\nreactions where the surface localization and discrete initial and\nfinal states of the reaction can generate significant sensitivity\nof the transition amplitude to the extent of linear and angular\nmomentum (mis-)matching, and which leads to semiclassical\nconditions for well-matched transfer cross sections, e.g.,\nRef. [51]. The (dominant) stripping and elastic breakup\nknockout mechanisms are inclusive with respect to the final\nstates of the target and projectile, respectively. The main\nassumption of the eikonal theory, that the core (residue)\nnucleus travels with constant velocity throughout the collision,\nis well satisfied at energies of order 100 MeV per nucleon and\nis verified empirically by the measured centroids of the residue\nparallel momentum distributions.\nC.

At the extremes\nof nuclear binding, reduction factors Rs \u2248 0.25\u20130.40 are\nfound in the removal of a nucleon of the deficient species [e.g.,\nthe results from the present study of (24Si,23Si) and (28S,27S),\nwhereas the reduction factors are much closer to unity, with\nRs \u2248 0.80\u20131.0, when the removed nucleon is in excess (e.g.,\nthe results from the present study of (24Si,23Al) and (28S, 27P)].\nThe results of the present work fit nicely into the existing\nsystematics and give additional support to the suggestion\nthat the strength of correlation effects, missing to an (as yet)\nunknown extent from effective interaction theories \u2014 here the\nshell model \u2014 depend on the asymmetry of the two nucleon\nFermi surfaces. The present work suggests an enhancement of\nthe correlation effects experienced by strongly bound valence\nnucleons of the deficient type and weakened correlations of\nthe excess nucleons at the weakly bound Fermi surface.\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nR\nS \n=\n \n\u03c3\ne\nxp\n \n\/ \u03c3\nth\nSkX Skxs15Sly4Skm* Bsk9 Skxs20 Skxs25\n24Si-1n\n24Si-1p\nFIG. 7.

Figure 7 shows the\ndeduced suppression factors Rs for the reactions 9Be (24Si,\n23Al)X and 9Be(24Si, 23Si)X for several different Skyrme\nparametrizations, including the SkX model, favored here.\nAs mentioned in Sec. III, we use the SkX Skyrme inter-\naction [35] for the nuclear densities and single-particle rms\nradii because it has been extensively tested with regard to size\nand binding energy observables [36\u201338]. But there are other\nSkyrme parameter sets available. The main difference between\nthem can be related to the nuclear-matter incompressibility K\nand the slope of the neutron equation-of-state near nuclear-\nmatter density Pn. Pn is correlated with the neutron-skin\nthickness in nuclei with N \u0004= Z [52] and hence can be a\nsource of uncertainty for the densities and single-particle radii\nin nuclei far from stability. The SkX interaction has a relatively\nlarge incompressibility, K = 270 MeV, and a neutron skin of\nT = rn \u2212 rp = 0.16 fm for 208Pb, where rp\/n is the rms radius\nfor protons\/neutrons. Thus, we need to test the sensitivity of\nour results to reasonable variations in the Skyrme parameters\nrelated to these quantities. The results for one-proton and\none-neutron removal from 24Si are shown in Fig. 7. Skm\u2217 [53]\nis used because it gives a slightly better surface diffuseness for\nthe charge density [37,54] compared to SkX. This change can\nbe traced to a smaller nuclear matter incompressibility, which\nis smaller for Skm\u2217 (K = 215 MeV) compared to SkX. The\nrecent Skxs15, Skxs20, and Skxs25 Skyrme interactions [54]\nrepresent a reasonable variation of neutron-skin thickness in\n208Pb [52], with T = 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 fm, respectively,\nand all have K = 200 MeV. We also compare to results\nwith the widely used Sly4 interaction [55] (K = 230 MeV\nand T = 0.16 fm) and with the Bsk9 interaction [56] ob-\ntained from a recent global fit to binding energies together\n044306-8\nREDUCTION OF SPECTROSCOPIC STRENGTH: WEAKLY- . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 044306 (2008)\nwith the Friedman-Pandharipande prediction for Pn (K =\n230 MeV and T = 0.16 fm). The variation of the Rs values is\ndominated by the different single-particle radii obtained from\nthese Skyrme interactions that affects the single-particle cross\nsections as shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 7 we find that the\ntheoretical error on the reduction factors is about 15%. This is\nsmall compared to the difference between Rs for 24Si-1p and\n24Si-1n. When these nuclear matter parameters become better\nestablished the results for Rs could be reevaluated to reduce\nthe 15% uncertainty.\nV. SUMMARY\nIn summary, we have deduced the reduction of measured\nspectroscopic strength relative to USDB effective interac-\ntion shell-model calculations for two exotic nuclei at the\nextremes of nuclear binding. The heavy-ion-induced one-\nproton knockout reactions 9Be(28S,27P)X and 9Be(24Si,23Al)X\nand one-neutron knockout reactions 9Be(28S,27S)X and\n9Be(24Si,23Si)X were used to probe weakly bound proton states\nand strongly bound neutron states at their respective Fermi\nsurfaces. Our results confirm earlier analyses that indicate a\nstronger reduction in single-particle strength for the strongly\nbound, deficient nucleon type and a reduction of closer to unity\nfor the weakly bound, excess nucleon type. If the reduction is\nattributed to correlations missing from truncated-model-space\neffective-interaction theories, the present work adds support\nto a scenario in which the valence nucleons of the deficient\nnucleon species are subject to stronger correlations than\nthose of the excess nucleon species. Uniquely, this effect is\naccessible to study in exotic nuclei in the vicinity of the drip\nlines, where these very asymmetric Fermi surfaces are the\nnorm.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Science Founda-\ntion under grant nos.
