The paper argues that there are substantial differences in the way in\nwhich MS was conceived, and developed in both sides of the Atlantic and that this has marked the way ST has\ndeveloped. ST in the UK has much more systemic edge which has resulted in the development of a number of\nsystemic methodologies whereas in the US, MS and ST is still view as associated with a logical, systematic\napproach and heavily informed by the development of techniques and decision making aids. After revising earlier\nclassifications of management sciences methodologies, a framework to classify its development identifying four stages\nis proposed: (1) problem solving methods located between 1940 and 1970; (2) situation-Improving methodologies in the\n70s and 80s; (3) Intervention-empowering methodologies 80s and 90s; and (4) a multi-paradigmatic era in the 90s at to\nthe present time. From the classification proposed, conclusions are drawn, highlighting the differences between US and\nUK systems thinking approaches.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.iigss.net\/Scientific-Inquiry\/June2008\/2-Paucar-Caceres.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>International Institute for General Systems Studies<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-10-13T14:56:53Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>Scientific inquiry, 2008, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 3-18<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1552-1222<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/84179<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.iigss.net\/Scientific-Inquiry\/mission.html<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.iigss.net\/Scientific-Inquiry\/June2008\/2-Paucar-Caceres.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":["http:\/\/www.iigss.net\/Scientific-Inquiry\/mission.html","http:\/\/www.iigss.net\/Scientific-Inquiry\/June2008\/2-Paucar-Caceres.pdf"],"year":2009,"topics":["Systems thinking","Soft systems","Management sciences","Operational research","Philosophy of OR"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
