For example,  in ep idermal  wound heal ing, \nmodels  have been proposed in which cells move and  prol i ferate, somet imes in response to chemical  \nsignals, forming a wave which moves into the  space to close the  wound (see, for example,  [1-3]). \nMechanochemica l  models  for dermal  wound heal ing hypothes ize  that  cells exert  t rac t ion  forces on \nextracel lu lar  matr ix ,  set t ing  up mot ion  and  guidance cues to which they  respond as they  invade \nthe  wound space and  eventua l ly  close the  wound [4,5]. \nThis work was carried out at Queensland University of Technology during a visit by P.

MAINI et al. \n~mour  cancer cells are hypothesized to outcompete normal  cells setting up waves of inva- \nsion [6], or to invade normal  tissue by degrading extracellular matrix with proteases [7]. Angio- \ngenesis, the process by which a tumour  recruits endothelial cells and establishes its own vascular \nsystem, is thought to occur as a directed wave propagation of cells from the normal  host vascu- \nlature to the tumour  under the influence of tumour  angiogenesis factors secreted by tumour  cells \n(see, for example, [8]). \nThe  above processes are modelled, in the main, by systems of coupled nonlinear partial- \ndifferential equations which describe the spatiotemoporal evolution of cells and signalling cues. \nCells are assumed to diffuse (usually modelled by Fickian diffusion) and respond to various \nchemical signals via chemokinesis and\/or chemotaxis, and to mechanical signals via haptotaxis \n(movement  up adhesive gradients), and contact guidance. The  models are solved using a mixture \nof analytical and numerical techniques and have been shown to exhibit constant profile constant \nspeed travelling waves in cell density. \nAl though there is good evidence that such propagating travelling waves exist in ecology (see, \nfor example, [9]), we  are unaware of this being shown conclusively in the aforementioned medical \napplications. \nIn this paper, we  consider a much simpler system and show that a wound healing assay does \nindeed appear to admit travelling waves of constant speed. Moreover, we  show that the data is \nwell fitted by Fisher's equation, a single reaction-diffusion equation that was initially proposed \nas a model  for the spread of an advantageous gene in a population [10,11]. \nIn the next section, we describe briefly the experimental set-up and results. Then, we  consider \nthe Fisher equation and compare its behaviour to the experimental results. Finally, we  discuss \nthe implications of this work. \nWOUND HEAL ING ASSAY AND RESULTS \nWe refer the reader to the paper [12] for full experimental details. Briefly, human peritoneal \nmesothelial cells (HPMCs) were grown as monolayers on different substrates to confluence. In- \ntracellular matrices used were collagen I, collagen IV, laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and \nhyaluronic acid. A 4 mm scrape wound was then made and the displaced cells were removed. \nThe remaining cells were bathed in fresh culture medium and the position of the invading cell \nfront was noted against a reference grid. Figure 1 shows the typically observed sharp front of \ncells invading the space left by the scrape. \nThe results for all substrates and all experiments were remarkably consistent. After a short \nperiod of time, the cell fronts progress with what appears to be a constant wavespeed (see \nFigure 2). \nTHE MODEL \nWe propose that the waves observed are Fisher waves. That is, we assume that the cell \nmovement can be modelled by Fickian diffusion and that proliferation satisfies a logistic growth \ncurve. Furthermore, we assume from the experimental set up that the process is occurring in one \nspace dimension. Hence, the model is \nan 02n \n0-7 = D-o~x2 + rn(g  - n), (1) \nwhere n(x,  t) denotes cell number density at position x and time t, D is the diffusion coefficient \n(assumed constant), rN  is linear growth rate of cells, and N is the carrying capacity. \nFor the experimental set up, the initial conditions would be of Heaviside type. However, we \nactually take as our starting point the first measurement, which is after 9.5 hours. At this stage, \nthe initial condition will be a \"smoothed\" Heaviside. However, the exact profile of the initial \ncondition is not as important as the observation that it has compact support. Under these \nTravelling Waves 577 \nFigure 1. A typical human peritoneal mesothelial cell front ten hours after wounding. \nconditions, it is well known that the model exhibits a constant profile travelling wave moving \nwith constant speed (see, for example, [13] for references) \nv = 247- . (2) \nThus, we see that this travelling wave solution has a nontrivial set of initial conditions for \nwhich it is asymptotically attracting. Figure 3 illustrates a typical plot of front distance from \norigin with time, together with a least-squares fit assuming a front moving with constant speed. \nAs can be seen, the actual wave initially moves at a speed greater than that of the fit, then it \nmoves more slowly, then the speed increases almost monotonically to the asymptotic wavespeed. \nIn all the experiments we analysed, the wavefront initially moves at a speed greater than the \nspeed predicted from the least-squares fit. Then, the speed decreases below that of the fitted \nspeed. After this, in some cases, we see a monotonic increase to the fitted speed, in other cases we \nsee a slight overshoot (as in Figure 3) before it eventually settles down. Figure 4 illustrates this \nmore clearly. Note that the prediction from the Fisher equation is that initially the wavespeed \nwill be greater than the asymptotically predicted wavespeed, then the speed will decrease and \napproach the asymptotic wavespeed from below [14]. This is very close to the behaviour that we \nobserve xperimentally. \nTo make a quantitative comparison between the predicted wavespeed and the actual wavespeed, \nwe need to know the cell doubling time and diffusion coefficient. Unfortunately, these quantities \nwere not measured in the original experiments. However, we know that typical cell doubling times \n578 P .K .

So, assuming a cell doubling time of five days and a diffusion coefficient of \nsay 10 -6 mm2s -1, we predict a wavespeed of 9.1 \u00d7 10 -3  mmhr -1, which compares well with the \nactual measured wavespeeds that lie within the range 5.4 \u00d7 10 -3  mmhr- l - -9 .4  \u00d7 10 -3 mmhr -1 \ncalculated from the data (variation arising due to different patients and different substrates). \nCONCLUSIONS \nSeveral authors have predicted constant speed travelling waves for various biological processes. \nThis prediction has been based on models that are, essentially, extensions of the basic Fisher \nequation in which cell movement is affected by mechanochemical ues and cell division is affected \nby chemical signals. In this paper, we have considered a very simple wound healing migration \nassay and have shown that it exhibits constant speed travelling waves with a speed consistent \nwith that predicted by Fisher's equation. Moreover, we have shown that the way in which the \nwavespeed approaches this asymptotic wavespeed is very close to that predicted by the model. \nTo our knowledge, this is the first verification of Fisher's equation in a medical context. \nREFERENCES \n1.
