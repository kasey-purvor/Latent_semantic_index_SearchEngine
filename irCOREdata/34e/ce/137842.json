It is expected that energy \ncrops, particularly willow (Salix spp) grown as short rotation coppice (SRC) \nand Miscanthus will make a major contribution to achieving these targets and \nthis will require the planting of large areas of these crops across Europe.  \nSRC, a perennial crop which is expected to be in the ground for 20 to 30 \nyears, is harvested in winter after the leaves have fallen, on a 2- to 3-year \ncycle. In Scandinavia, harvesting takes place when the soil is frozen but, in \nthe UK and elsewhere in northern Europe, the harvest will frequently coincide \nwith wet weather and high soil water contents (Wall and Deboys, 1997; \nMitchell et al., 1999). Under these conditions, compaction, puddling and \n                                            \n1 Corresponding author: \nTel: +44 (0)1525 863296 \nFax: +44 (0)1525 863344 \nE-mail: W.Stephens@Cranfield.ac.uk\nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  2 \nrutting are particularly likely given the high axle loads of SRC harvesters and \nassociated machinery (Soane et al., 1981; Kofman and Spinelli, 1997). Apart \nfrom damaging the soil, rutting and loss of traction delays the harvesting \noperation, adds to costs and can result in sideways slippage of machinery, \ncausing mechanical damage to stools.  \nThe effects of soil compaction on plant growth are complex but reductions \nin yield have been reported in both temperate (Lipiec and Simota, 1994) and \ntropical (Kayombo and Lal, 1994) crops. This has frequently been attributed to \nmechanical impedance of root growth resulting in reduced water (Nambiar \nand Sands, 1992) and nutrient uptake (Alakukku and Elonen, 1995) or \ninsufficient aeration (Liang et al. 1999, Lipiec and Simota, 1994). Water \navailability for crops might be further reduced by decreased infiltration (Soane \nand Ouwerkerk, 1995), resulting from the decline in hydraulic conductivity \nwhich generally accompanies compaction (Horton et al., 1994). Compaction \nalso often results in reduced plant populations (Arvidsson and H\u00e5kansson, \n1996) and the production of smaller, stunted plants with low light interception \n(Assaeed et al., 1990). Although most of these effects have been described \nfor annual crops, trees also appear to be similarly affected, notwithstanding \ntheir deeper root system (Wronski and Murphy, 1994). \nIn perennial crops, however, there is little opportunity to reduce \ncompaction by deep cultivation; wheelings can remain compacted for 30-40 \nyears (Wronski and Murphy, 1994). The impacts of the compaction and \nmechanical damage that large machinery can cause in willow SRC systems \nhave not been quantified. This paper describes the effects of soil compaction \nand mechanical damage at harvesting on soil properties, willow SRC growth \nand biomass production in two soil types. The effectiveness of soil loosening \ntreatments is tested.  \nMethods \nSites, treatments and experimental design \nTwo trials were conducted on different soil types. The first was at \nKettering, Northamptonshire (52\u00b04' N, 0\u00b0 4' W) on clay loam overlying clay \n(Hanslope series) hereafter referred to as CL. The plantation was established \nin 1994 and consisted of 10 ha of a mixed-clonal planting of willow. Trees \nwere planted in double rows spaced at 1.5 m between the rows, 0.9 m within \nthe rows and 1 m along the rows, giving 8,330 plants ha-1. A site survey in \nFebruary 1997 showed that the Salix viminalis clone \u2018Q683\u2019 was the most \nuniform and so plots of this clone were demarcated for the trial. Each plot was \n20 m long and consisted of two experimental double rows and two outer \ndouble guard rows. A randomised block experimental design was used in \nwhich six experimental treatments were replicated three times. Plots were \ninitially harvested by hand to eliminate effects of harvesting damage, after \nwhich the experimental treatments were imposed (Table 1).  \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  3 \nTable 1. Treatments imposed on willow SRC. \nTreatment \ncode \nTreatment name Description \nT1 Control No compaction and no mechanical damage to stools \nT2 Moderate compaction Three passes of a 7-tonne loader either side of each \ndouble row \nT3 Heavy compaction Three passes of a 7-tonne loader between and within \neach double row \nT4 Mechanical damage 7-tonne loader driven over the cut stools \nT5 General loosening Heavy compaction followed by loosening using a \nhigh-lift, winged, subsoiling tine to 30 cm depth \nT6 Localised loosening Heavy compaction followed by loosening using a low-\nlift, winged, subsoiling tine with a cutting disc ahead of \nthe tine leg to a depth of 30 cm \n \nWhen compaction treatments were imposed the loader (Sanderson, 247TS \nTeleporter) was fitted with 16.9\/14-28 and 12.5\/80-18 tyres on front and rear \nwheels respectively, inflated to a pressure of 3 bars. The soil was relatively \ndry (21% volumetric water content) when the compaction treatments were \napplied. The basic features of the deep loosening tines were described by \nSpoor and Godwin (1978) as shown in Figure 1. In treatment T5, the wing lift \nheight was 100 mm and the tine had a wide leading share (80 mm) while in \ntreatment T6 wing lift height was 50 mm and the share width was 25 mm.  \nWing lift height\na) Section\nb) Plan\nShare width\nWing\nShare\nLeg\nSoil surface\n0.3 m depth\nDirection of travel\n \nFigure 1. a) Section and b) plan view of a winged tine of the type used to loosen \ncompacted soil. The tine is pulled through the soil behind a tractor. \nIn devising compaction treatments (T2 and T3), the primary concern was to \nproduce a range of treatments differing in the severity of the compaction. They \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  4 \nwere not all intended to replicate on-farm harvesting conditions. Thus, T2 \nrepresents the type of loads which would often pass between double rows \nduring harvesting whilst the compaction in treatment T3 is greater than would \nbe expected to occur commercially. The two loosening treatments were \nincluded to see whether the effects of serious compaction, caused by the \nheavy traffic, could be mitigated. \nThe second trial at Silsoe, Bedfordshire (52\u00b0 2' N, 0\u00b0 2' W) was on \nsandy loam overlying sandy clay loam (Cottenham series) henceforth called \nSL. In February 1998, 0.2 m length cuttings of Salix viminalis \u2018Q683\u2019 were \nplanted in a double row design at a spacing of 1.5 m between double rows, \n0.8 m within the rows and 0.9 m along the rows giving 9,660 plants ha-1. The \ntrial was allowed to establish during 1998, during which irrigation was applied \ntwice in August. It was then harvested by hand in late February 1999 and, \nusing the same plot size and experimental design as at the CL site, the same \nsix treatments were imposed in early March when the volumetric soil water \ncontent was high (32%). A combination of severe infestation by the Great \nWillow Aphid (Tuberolachnus salignus Gmelin) and water stress caused the \ncomplete defoliation and subsequent dieback of part of this experiment in \nSeptember 1999 so that in the following year it proceeded with only two \nblocks and without the loosened treatments. \nSoil measurements \nAt each site, soil pits were dug and samples collected from 0.1 m depth \nand then at 0.2 m intervals down to 0.9 m for analysis of soil particle size (6 \nsamples) and water holding characteristics (3 samples). One year after \nimposing the treatments, pits were dug across the rows to a depth of 1 m to \nexpose the root systems of four stools in compacted and control plots. Root \nprofile maps were drawn, marking the ends of all visible roots on a large piece \nof clear plastic placed over the soil pit wall. Visual assessments of soil \nstructure were also conducted to identify the main soil horizons and \ncompaction zones. On the clay loam, root length density was determined from \nsoil blocks (ranging from 0.002 to 0.008 m3) taken at four depths in the profile \n(0.1 m, 0.2 m, 0.4 m and 0.75 m) to sample each horizon as well as the area \nimmediately below the wheelings. Roots were then washed, separated, \narranged on a Perspex tray and scanned. Length was determined from digital \nimages using image analysis software (Delta-T Scan, Delta-T devices, \nCambridge). Roots down to 0.08 mm diameter could be detected using this \nmethod. \nJust before and after treatments were imposed, six measurements \nplot-1 of soil strength between the double rows were made at 0.03 m depth \nintervals down to 0.45 m with a Bush SP500 penetrometer (Findlay, Irvine \nLtd., Penicuik, Scotland).  \nMeteorological data \nAn automatic weather station (Skye Mini-met, Skye Instruments, \nPowys, Wales) was installed at the Kettering site and soil temperature, air \ntemperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and rainfall \nrecorded hourly. Data from an existing automatic weather station (Cassella \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  5 \nLtd., Kempston, Bedfordshire) located approximately 0.6 km from the Silsoe \nfield trial were collected, and the same variables were recorded as at \nKettering. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated for both sites \nusing the Penman-Monteith combination equation as described by Smith \n(1991). \nPlant measurements \nIn each experimental plot, five stools were chosen for measurements. \nMonthly counts were made of the number of stems stool-1 to determine stem \ndensity (number of stems m-2), and the basal diameter of 15 of the stems on \neach stool was measured with digital calipers (Camlab, Cambridge). Stems \nfrom spare plots of \u2018Q683\u2019 were harvested at the end of each year to derive \nrelationships between stem basal area (SBA) and stem dry mass. The \nrelationships fitted were logarithmic forms of the power curve, Y = a (SBA)b: \nln y = ln a + b ln(SBA)        (1) \nwhere Y is dry mass (g), a and b are constants and SBA is in cm2. These \nrelationships were used retrospectively to estimate stem dry matter from the \nstem diameter measurements. Stem dry mass ha-1 was calculated as the \nproduct of stem density ha-1 and average stem dry mass.  \nLeaf area index (LAI) and light interception were measured at monthly \nintervals with a SunScan system (Delta-T devices, Cambridge, UK). Fractional \ninterception was interpolated between these dates and used to calculate the \ndaily solar radiation intercepted by each plot. Seasonal radiation conversion \nratios were determined for each treatment from the seasonal increments in \nstem dry mass ha-1 and seasonal solar radiation interception by the crop. \nAt harvest, areas 10 x 5 m at Kettering and 7.2 x 4.6 m at Silsoe were \ndemarcated in the centre of each plot and within these areas all stools were \ncut by chain saw at 0.1 m above ground level. For each stool, the number of \nstems and fresh mass of all stems were recorded. Fresh mass was converted \nto dry mass using fresh:dry mass ratios, obtained from 1-2 kg samples of \nstems taken from each plot which were oven-dried at 100 \u00b0C to constant \nmass. \nData analysis \nData were analysed mainly by ANOVA using Genstat for Windows (NAG Ltd, \nOxford) with a randomized block design. Where repeated measurements were \nmade through the season, an ANOVA was performed on the data from each \nmeasurement occasion. \nResults  \nMeteorological data \nWhile Silsoe is generally dryer than Kettering and has a considerably \nhigher ETo (Table 2), the two sites have similar radiation and temperature \nregimes. At Silsoe, rainfall was particularly low and exceeded by ETo in 1997 \nand 1999, the year when experimental treatments were imposed. \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  6 \nTable 2.

The \nsoil dry bulk density increased from 1.35 g cm-3 in the control treatments to \n1.65 g cm-3 in the compacted CL soil at 0.1 m depth. At Silsoe the values \nwere 1.40 g cm-3 and 1.70 g cm-3 respectively. Heavy compaction reduced \nsoil available water content at Kettering to 96 mm m-1 but at Silsoe it was \nincreased slightly to 157 mm m-1. Rut depths were 46 mm on average on the \nCL and 100 mm in the SL immediately after compaction treatments were \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  8 \nimposed. The average rut depth decreased to 21 mm on the CL after three \ngrowing seasons and 68 mm on the SL after two, but at both sites, penetration \nresistance still remained higher in the compacted than in the control \ntreatments.  \n \nFigure 3. Root length density in the structural horizons identified in soil pits dug in clay \nloam in control and heavily compacted plots. Bars indicate the standard error of the \ndifference between treatment means at each depth (6 df). For comparison, root length \ndensity in the compacted zone (CZ) of compacted plots is also shown. \nIn the CL, in both heavily compacted and control plots, the greatest root \nlength density was found in the top 0.1 m of the soil profile (Figure 3) and was \nhighest in compacted plots. Below 0.1 m, there was little difference between \nthe treatments and roots were found down to 1.0 m. At both trial sites, U-\nshaped zones of compacted soil extending from the surface to about 0.4 m \ndeep and about 0.3 m beyond each rut were evident in compacted plots. In \nthese compacted zones in the CL, root length density was 14 % less than that \nfrom 0 to 0.3 m depth in the control treatment, suggesting that the \nconsolidated nature of the material restricted root penetration and growth. In \nthe surface soil surrounding these compacted areas, however, root length \ndensity was greater than the average value for the control treatment, \nsuggesting compensation for the restricted development under the ruts. Root \ndistribution maps also indicated reduced root numbers underneath ruts in the \nheavily compacted plots.  \nCanopy development and radiation interception \nIn the first year of growth after coppicing, the LAI of SRC had reached \na maximum of 7 compared to around 4 on SL (Figure 4). Canopy development \nin the spring, however, was more rapid on SL so that the control treatment \nhad a LAI of 2 by mid-May compared with about mid-June on CL. At both \nsites, the mechanical damage caused a smaller LAI than the control treatment \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  9 \nthrough most of the season and this was as LAI approached its highest values \nin summer. By contrast, there were no significant differences between the \ncontrol, compacted and loosening treatments. Trends in the second year were \nqualitatively similar. \nWith the exception of the mechanical damage treatment, similar \namounts of solar radiation were intercepted by all treatments over each \ngrowing season (66 \u2013 80%). On a sandy loam, SRC in the control, compacted \nand loosening treatments intercepted 73% of the incoming 3050 MJ m-2 of \nsolar radiation but only 65% in the mechanical damage treatment.  \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nLe\naf\n a\nre\na \nin\nde\nx\na) \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\nLe\naf\n A\nre\na \nIn\nde\nx\nNo compaction\nHeavy compaction\nMechanical damage\nModerate compaction\nb)\n \nFigure 4.

Maximum stem \ndensity occurred in June of the first growing season (Figure 5a). This was then \nfollowed by considerable stem death and a period of reduction in stem density \noccurred annually between about June and August. In the control treatment in \nthe first growing season, for example, stem density fell from 38.6 to 21.5 m-2, \na 44% reduction and by November 2000 it reached 12.7 m-2, a 67% reduction \nfrom the maximum in 1997.  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nApr 97 Oct 97 Apr 98 Oct 98 Apr 99 Oct 99 Apr 00 Oct 00\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf s\nte\nm\ns \nm\n-2\nNo compaction Moderate compaction\nHeavy compaction Mechanical damage\na)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nApr 99 Jul 99 Oct 99 Jan 00 Apr 00 Jul 00 Oct 00\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf s\nte\nm\ns \nm\n-2\nb)\n \nFigure 5.

(2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  11 \nStem production on CL was very significantly reduced by mechanical \ndamage and, in June 1997, was only 66% that of the control. However, stem \nsurvival was greater in SRC subjected to mechanical damage, particularly \nduring the first growing season. The stem density in the other treatments fell \nproportionately more and, by November 2000, it was estimated that SRC that \nhad been mechanically damaged had almost 90% of the number of stems in \nthe control. A similar pattern of stem death was seen on SL (Figure 5b) so that \nin November 1999 and 2000, stem density in the control treatment was 56% \nand 43%, respectively of the maximum recorded in May 1999. Although the \nlargest and most significant reduction in stem density was caused by the \nmechanical damage treatment, heavy compaction also resulted in significant \nreductions in the first year. \nAt neither site were there any stool deaths over the experimental \nperiod, even where they had been subjected to substantial mechanical \ndamage so that the number of shoots stool-1 varied in the same way as the \nshoot density. \nLong-term effects on biomass production \nAt the end of the first growing season on CL, there were no significant \ndifferences in estimated stem dry matter production between any of the \ntreatments (Figure 6a) and biomass production was between 9 and 11 t ha-1. \nAt the end of the third growing season there were still no significant \ndifferences and standing stem dry matter was between 27 and 32 t ha-1, \nindicating that mechanically damaged plants compensated for a reduced stem \ndensity by producing larger stems. From the second to fourth year there was a \ndecline in stem dry mass from about July onwards which can be attributed to \nthe death of stems. By the end of the rotation, there was considerable within \nplot variability on CL. \nAt the end of the first growing season on SL, stem biomass in the control \ntreatment was 8 t ha-1 (Figure 6b). There were significant differences in stem \nbiomass between the treatments on SL, with the heavy compaction treatment \nproducing approximately 20 % less than the control treatment, and the \nmechanically damaged treatment 50 % less at only 4 t ha-1. These differences \nwere smaller in the second growing season and biomass production in all \ntreatments was similar, at around 8 t ha-1 y-1. Based on harvested yields, the \naverage annual biomass production by the control treatments at the two sites \nwas very similar, 8.3 t ha-1 on CL and 8.1 t ha-1 on SL.  \nTable 3 shows the effects of the experimental treatments on the \ncomponents of yield at harvest when willow stems grown on CL and SL were \n4 and 2 years old, respectively. The effects of compaction and soil loosening \nwere not significant at either site. Even the heaviest compaction only reduced \nyields by 12% compared with the control sites. By contrast, mechanical \ndamage to stools caused 9% and 21% reductions in total stem dry mass on \nCL and SL, respectively. Fewer stems m-2 and fewer stools ha-1 (on CL) \ncontributed to smaller yields while mean stem dry weight on mechanically \nSouch et al.

Increases in soil strength were particularly marked on the sandy \nloam soil. The effects of compaction on soil structure were restricted, \nhowever, to 0.4 m beneath the wheelings. There was little root growth in this \nzone but compensatory growth occurred in the uncompacted topsoil. A similar \nresponse has been observed in pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) where roots \navoided compact layers and proliferated in weaker zones (Nambiar and \nSands, 1992).  \nThe proportion of the root zone affected by compaction will depend on \nthe proportion of the area trafficked and the depth of the root system. At the \nplant spacing used in these experiments and with a root depth of 0.5 m, root \ngrowth for the heavy and moderate compaction treatments would have been \nrestricted by compaction to about 42% and 21%, respectively, of the rooting \nvolume. Once the root system developed below the compacted layer the \nproportion of the root zone restricted would decline rapidly so that, by the time \nthe roots reached 2 m depth, only 10% would be compacted even in the \nheavily compacted treatments. SRC will thus be most susceptible to \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  14 \ncompaction damage when it is very young or is growing on shallow soils. It \nalso emphasises the need to alleviate any compaction if present in the main \nrooting zone before planting SRC. \nOn CL, non-destructive plant measurements through the duration of the \nexperiment indicated that there were no significant long-term effects on \ngrowth or biomass production attributable to the compaction treatments. On \nSL, the effect of heavy compaction on biomass decreased from a 21% \nreduction at the end of the first growing season to be insignificant by the end \nof the second growing season.  \nThe larger effect of heavy compaction on SL than on CL can be \nattributed to the following factors: the greater susceptibility of SL to \ncompaction; the younger crop on SL, which had only established for one year \ncompared with three on CL; and the higher evaporative demand at the SL \nsite, which would have resulted in the plants experiencing greater water \nstress. The moderate compaction treatment on SL did not, however, have a \nsignificant effect on biomass production, confirming results from earlier \nresearch in the UK that also indicated that normal harvesting operations had \nno effect on willow yields (Forest Research, 1998). It is also likely that the \ndevelopment of an extensive root mat in willow SRC systems would help to \nprotect the soil from compaction by providing mechanical support for vehicles. \nRoot profile maps for the at showed that while roots could be found down to 1 \nm, most occurred in the top 0.3 m. This dense surface rooting habit has also \nbeen shown elsewhere with 40-45% of both fine root length and mass \noccurred within the top 0.1 m (Rytter and Hannson, 1996). \n The traditional agricultural response to soil compaction is to alleviate it \nby subsoiling (Spoor and Godwin, 1978). In this experiment, however, there \nappeared to be no benefits of subsoiling, probably because of damage to \nplant roots.  \nIn contrast to compaction, mechanical damage, caused by driving a 7 t \nfront-loader over the stools, resulted in large and significant effects on plant \ngrowth, reducing stem density and LAI in the first year on both CL and SL \nsoils. For example, there was a 50% reduction in stem dry mass at the end of \nthe first year on SL. At the final harvests yield reductions of 9% and 21% \noccurred on CL and SL sites respectively. At both sites in the first year of the \ntrial, control plants produced a large number of stems by June but 44% of \nthese died by the end of the season. Stools subject to mechanical damage \nproduced far fewer stems in the first year, but a smaller proportion of these \ndied (26% at Kettering and 24% at Silsoe) compared with the control. This \ntrend continued over succeeding years so that the difference in stem density \nbetween the two treatments grew less with time.  \nThe high shoot mortality seen in control plants is not unusual in willow \nand three years after cutting can be as high as 90% (Ceulemans et al., 1996). \nNormally the shoots which die are small and contribute little to total biomass \n(Hyt\u00f6nen, 1995; Verwijst, 1991). As a result of stem death in the control \ntreatment, there was little difference by the second year in LAI between the \ntreatments on CL although differences still persisted on SL. These differences \ndid not result in appreciably higher solar radiation interception by the control \ntreatment in the second year, however, because a LAI of about 4.0 was \nSouch et al. (2004) Plant and Soil 263:173-182.  15 \nsufficient to intercept about 90% of solar radiation. A similar level of radiation \ninterception with a LAI of 4 was also found for both Populus trichocarpa and \nSalix viminalis by Cannell et al. (1988).  \nThe main effect of mechanical damage on stem numbers appeared to \nbe as a result of the above-ground damage to the stool, which caused a \nreduction in the number of buds. At the end of the first and second years, \nrespectively, non-destructive measurements indicated that mechanical \ndamage caused a 49% and 35% reduction in biomass on SL compared with \n11% and 0% on CL. The different response to mechanical damage at the two \nsites can be attributed to several factors. First, in the year of treatment (1997 \nat Kettering [CL] and 1999 at Silsoe[SL]), seasonal rainfall was almost \n120 mm less at the SL site than at the CL site. The evaporative demand on \nthe SL site was 20% greater, therefore inducing more water stress than on the \nCL site. Second, the SRC on SL was younger than that on CL (1 compared \nwith 3 years old) so that its root system would have been much shallower. \nSeveral other studies have indicated that the effects of compaction on plant \ngrowth interact with water stress (Liang et al. 1999) and diminished or not \ndetectable in loose soil (Miller et al., 1996; Quesnel and Curran, 2000). The \nprofiles of soil strength showed a bigger difference between the control and \nheavy compaction of the SL site, suggesting greater compaction at depth.  \nIn spite of the differences in climate, soil and duration of the \nexperiments on CL and SL, harvested stem biomass from the control \ntreatments averaged over years was very similar (8.1 t ha-1 yr-1 on SL and 8.3 \nt ha-1 yr-1 on CL) and comparable to the average of 8.1 t ha-1 yr-1 estimated for \nwillow trials in the UK by Mitchell et al. (1999).  \nIn conclusion, this study has demonstrated that if soil compaction can \nbe avoided in the first years after planting then it is unlikely to have a major \nimpact on biomass yield once the root system is well established. \nFurthermore, willow SRC appears to be able to compensate for extensive \nmechanical damage to stools through better stem survival rates over the \nperiod of the coppice cycle. \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was funded by the UK Government\u2019s Department of \nEnvironment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) (Project OC9611).
