It produces high-quality research information on the \neffectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care \nin the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent \nand treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.\nThe research findings from the HTA programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee \n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they \nform a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three \nroutes to the start of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the \nNHS, from the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS \ntrusts. These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service \nusers). The HTA programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecond, the HTA programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research \nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThird, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA programme \ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together \nevidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They \ncan cost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, \nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before \npublication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series\nReports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA \nprogramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and \neditors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search, appraisal \nand synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication \nof the review by others.\nThe research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned by the National Coordinating Centre \nfor Research Methodology (NCCRM), and was formally transferred to the HTA programme in April 2007 \nunder the newly established NIHR Methodology Panel. The HTA programme project number is 06\/91\/06. \nThe contractual start date was in March 2005. The draft report began editorial review in April 2009 and \nwas accepted for publication in June 2009. The commissioning brief was devised by the NCCRM who \nspecified the research question and study design.

The UK NHS is undergoing \nsubstantial organisational change and there is a need to \nestablish which human resource (HR) initiatives may be \nmost effective.\nObjectives: To assess the results from a wide-ranging \nseries of systematic reviews of the evidence on HRM \nand performance. The first part assesses evidence \non use of HRM in the UK and fidelity of practice \nimplemented. The second part considers evidence \nfor the impact of HRM practices on intermediate \noutcomes, which can impact on final outcomes, such \nas organisational performance or patient care.\nData sources: The following databases were \nsearched: Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts \n(ASSIA), British Nursing Index (BNI), Business Source \nPremier, Campbell Collaboration, Cochrane Central \nRegister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane \nDatabase of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cumulative \nIndex to Nursing and Allied Health Literature \n(CINAHL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of \nEffectiveness (DARE), DH-Data, EMBASE, Health \nManagement Information Consortium (HMIC), \nInternational Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), \nKing\u2019s Fund database, MEDLINE, NHS Economic \nEvaluation Database (NHS EED), National Research \nRegister (NRR), PREMEDLINE, PsycINFO, ReFeR, \nSocial Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Science \nCitation Index (SCI). The searches were conducted in \nMay\/June 2006.\nReview methods: Broad categories of HRM \ninterventions and intermediate outcomes were \ngenerated: 10 HRM categories and 12 intermediate \noutcome categories. Seven patient final outcomes \nwere derived from the NHS Performance Indicators \nand the NHS Improvement Plan. The quality criteria \nused to select papers incorporated a longitudinal \nstudy design filter to provide evidence of the causal \ndirection of relationships between HRM and relevant \noutcomes. Single HRM practices were considered. \nWithin the health-specific literature, focus was on the \nimpact of HRM on patient outcomes. Information is \npresented on the reliability of measures in each of the \nintermediate outcome areas.\nResults: Work design practices that enhance \nemployee autonomy and control influenced a number \nof outcomes and there was consistent evidence \nfor the positive impact of increased job control \non employee outcomes, such as job satisfaction, \nabsence and health. For employee participation, the \nsmall number of studies reviewed supported the \ninvolvement of employees in design\/implementation \nof changes that affect their work. In health literature \nin particular, employee involvement through quality \nimprovement teams resulted in improved patient \noutcomes. Findings were positive for the impact of \ntraining on the intended outcomes of the initiatives. \nSupport for the impact of performance management \npractices was apparent, in particular feedback on \nperformance outcomes and the use of participative \ngoal setting. Strong associations were found among all \nintermediate outcomes, and the relationship between \nmost intermediate behaviours and outcomes were \nsignificant.\nLimitations: Limited evidence was available on the \nuse of HRM and on the implementation of policy. \nAlso, the specific practices studied within each HRM \ncategory differ so there was little evidence to show \nwhether similar practices have the same effects in \nhealth and non-health settings.\nAbstract\nSystematic review of the links between human \nresource management practices and performance\nM Patterson,1* J Rick,2 S Wood,3 C Carroll,4 S Balain5 and A Booth4\n1Institute of Work Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK\n2Health Services Research Group \u2013 Primary Care, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK\n3School of Management, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK\n4School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK\n5Management School, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK\n*Corresponding author\nAbstract\niv\nConclusions: Some potentially effective practices \nfor both health and non-health areas were identified, \nand HRM methods could be used to support change \nprocesses within the NHS; the findings relating to \nwork organisation are particularly promising with \nregard to changes in methods of service delivery.  \nUsing training to support the implementation of change \nis highlighted.

The NHS continues to undergo substantial \norganisational change, as indicated by increased \nemphasis on performance targets representing \ndrivers at local, national and clinical level.\nHuman resource management (HRM) is being \nseen as a vital element in the successful realisation \nof these change programmes and is being given \na greater prominence than it has traditionally. It \nis therefore timely to assess the evidence we have \non what human resource (HR) initiatives are most \neffective.\nHRM in the UK\nOver the past two decades, growing research \nattention has been given to exploring the links \nbetween organisational performance and HRM \nsystems and processes, and especially the much-\ntouted modern, high-involvement management \napproach. This has generated a large body of \nliterature, largely cross-sectional in nature, i.e. \nmeasures of performance and systems are taken at \nthe same time, so it is not possible to determine \ncause and effect. Reviews of this literature have \ngiven rise to the perception that the significance of \nHRM in determining organisational performance \nhas largely been proven. Increasingly, however, a \nnumber of researchers are questioning whether \nthe claims for evidence of a universal link between \nHRM and performance are overstated \u2013 while they \nendorse the importance of this line of research, \nthey particularly draw attention to methodological \nlimitations of the studies and the heterogeneity of \nthe measures of HRM used across the studies.\nThis report presents the results from a wide-\nranging series of systematic reviews of the evidence \non HRM and performance. The searches included \nliterature published up to June 2006 and covered \nthe general HRM literature, not simply the health \nliterature. It is distinctive in a number of ways:\n\u2022\t The quality criteria that were used to \nselect papers for inclusion incorporated a \nlongitudinal study design filter, as this may \nprovide evidence about the causal direction \nof relationships between HRM and relevant \noutcomes in a way that cross-sectional data \ncannot.\n\u2022\t The review considers single HRM practices \nand is not confined to collectivities of them, \nor \u2018bundles\u2019 as they are known in the high-\nperformance management literature.\n\u2022\t The review covers issues around the \nimplementation of HRM in practice and \nthe measurement of relevant intermediate \noutcomes in the HRM performance chain.\n\u2022\t Within the health-specific literature, the review \nis focused, in particular, on the impact of HRM \non patient outcomes.\nHow widespread is the use of \nHRM practices in the UK?\nThe first part of this review is concerned with \nevidence on the use of HRM in the UK and the \nfidelity or accuracy with which HRM practices \nare implemented. Limited evidence on the use of \nHRM is available. A review of national survey data \nidentified some evidence on the use of specific \nHRM practices in 10 broad practice categories, \nalthough very little was disaggregated to the health \nsector level. The most commonly cited practices \nwere family-friendly and work organisation ones, \nwhich were used in 70% of workplaces. The data \ndo not always indicate the precise extent of the \nuse practices within organisations, i.e. whether \npractices apply to all, or some, of the workforce.\nLittle is known, therefore, about what HRM \npractices are used within the NHS at the present \ntime. A more detailed picture could be achieved \nthrough further analysis of the Workplace \nEmployment Relations Survey (WERS) or through \nbespoke future surveys.\nHow well implemented are \nHRM practices?\nA further important consideration in assessing \nthe impact of HRM practices is implementation \nfidelity, i.e. the accuracy with which policies \nare implemented by organisations in practice. \nResearch from social policy, where the concept \nExecutive summary\nExecutive summary\nx\nof implementation fidelity is more established, \nindicates that the fidelity with which a practice \nin implemented is related to its efficacy. Within \nHRM, this review found only a few studies that \nhad collected data on the implementation of \na policy and this appeared to be an area that \nwas largely ignored in the HRM literature. \nThe majority of research focuses on policy or \nintended HRM practices rather than actual \nor implemented practices. This finding has \nconsiderable implications for interpretation of the \nresearch and understanding why a study might \nfind a weak, or no, relationship between a practice \nand its intended outcome. This review proposes \na framework for understanding and explaining \nprocesses at work in evaluating and achieving \nimplementation fidelity, within the context of HRM \nand policy. Appendices 3 and 4 present guidance \nand a checklist for evaluating fidelity, based on \nthese findings.\nFor all new HRM practices, the process of \nimplementation should be clearly stated and \nadherence to the implementation needs to be \nevaluated as well as any intended outcomes.\nImpact of HRM\nThe remit for the second part of this review \nwas to consider the evidence for the impact of \nHRM practices on intermediate outcomes (the \nintended outcomes of HRM) that may ultimately \nimpact on final outcomes such as organisational \nperformance or patient care. In other words, the \nfocus was on HRM interventions and employee \nmental, emotional and attitudinal states (and \ntheir measurement), thought to influence \nemployee behaviours that are salient to effective \norganisational performance.\nHRM practices and outcomes \nconsidered in the review\nBroad categories of HRM interventions and \nintermediate outcomes were generated through \nthe literature. This list was refined over the course \nof the study to produce 10 HRM categories and \n12 intermediate outcome categories. Seven patient \n(final) outcomes were derived from the NHS \nPerformance Indicators (Healthcare Commission \n2005) and the NHS Improvement Plan (NHS \n2005). No final outcomes were specified in the non-\nhealth-care literature (i.e. any longitudinal studies \nof HRM practices were considered for inclusion):\n\u2022\t HRM practices:\n \u2013 work design\n \u2013 staffing\n \u2013 training and development\n \u2013 compensation and rewards\n \u2013 communication\n \u2013 family friendly\n \u2013 single status\/status harmonisation\n \u2013 employee representation and participation\n \u2013 appraisal\/performance management\n \u2013 bundles of practices\n\u2022\t intermediate outcomes:\n \u2013 motivation\n \u2013 job satisfaction\n \u2013 organisational commitment\n \u2013 occupational commitment\n \u2013 engagement\n \u2013 burnout\n \u2013 job involvement\n \u2013 turnover intentions\n \u2013 psychological contract\n \u2013 organisational justice\n \u2013 organisational support\n \u2013 organisational climate\n\u2022\t final outcomes:\n \u2013 patient safety\n \u2013 patient-centred care\n \u2013 patient waiting times\n \u2013 patient satisfaction\n \u2013 health-related quality of life\n \u2013 patient mortality\n \u2013 patient stay\n \u2013 re-admissions.\nOverall findings on impact\nHRM in health and non-health settings\nThere is an imbalance in the practices covered, \nso in both health and non-health areas certain \ndomains of HRM are covered disproportionately \nmore than in others. This highlights areas of HRM \nthat have yet to be researched, including in an \nNHS context. Additionally, very few replication \nstudies were found, so many of the findings in this \nreport are based on only a small number of studies \nthat precludes the development of generalisable \nconclusions.\nSome HRM practices have been the subject of \nresearch in both the health and the non-health \nsectors. However, the specific practices that have \nbeen studied within each HRM category do differ, \nso there is little evidence to show whether similar \nHRM practices have the same effects in health and \nnon-health settings. An implication of this finding \nis that care needs to be taken when adopting HRM \npractices from outwith the NHS \u2013 it cannot be \nassumed that the same practices are appropriate in \nboth settings or that the same effects will accrue.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

However, our review \ndoes enable us to identify some potentially effective \npractices for both health and non-health areas.\n\u2022\t In the area of work design, practices that \nenhance employee autonomy and control are \ninfluential in relation to a number of outcomes \nand there is consistent evidence for the positive \nimpact of increased job control (in various \nforms) on employee outcomes such as job \nsatisfaction, absence and health.\n\u2022\t In the parallel field of employee participation, \nthe small number of studies reviewed here \nsupports the widely advocated principle \nof involving employees in the design and \nimplementation of changes (e.g. job redesign) \nthat affect their work. Specifically in the health \nliterature, employee involvement through \nquality improvement teams was found to \nbe effective in terms of improved patient \noutcomes.\n\u2022\t In the area of training, findings are consistently \npositive for the impact of training on the \nspecific intended outcomes of the training \ninitiatives.\n\u2022\t Support for the impact of performance \nmanagement practices is found and \nparticularly the importance of feedback \non performance outcomes and the use of \nparticipative goal setting.\nSuch evidence points to the HRM methods that \ncan be used to support and enhance change \nprocesses within the NHS. The findings in the \nwork organisation area are particularly promising \nin the light of considerable changes in methods \nof service delivery that are ongoing in the NHS. \nOpportunities for job and service redesign within \nthe NHS offer great scope for future exploration. \nThe use of training to support the implementation \nof change is also highlighted in the good practice \naround implementation fidelity identified by this \nreview, and therefore is important evidence on the \nprocess of HRM policy development and practice.\nRelationships between \nintermediate outcomes\nThe relationships amongst intermediate outcomes \nwere also examined. Moderate to high correlations \nwere found between all of the intermediate \noutcomes for which data were available. The \nassociations, although strong, do not suggest \nconstruct redundancy and it is reasonable to \nconclude that each of the intermediate outcomes \nidentified in this review may contribute uniquely \nto efforts to understand and manage employee \nbehaviours.\nThe review also explored the correlations between \nintermediate outcomes and productivity-enhancing \nbehaviours (e.g. individual job performance, \nemployee turnover). The relationships between \nmost intermediate outcomes and behaviours \nwere significant and of small to moderate \nstrength. The premise here is that intermediate \noutcomes are determinants of salient employee \nbehaviours, which, in turn, enhance organisational \nperformance. These data do not prove a causal link \nbut do demonstrate associations.\nImpact of intermediate \noutcomes on final outcomes\nThis review was unable to identify any longitudinal \nevidence to assess whether intermediate outcomes, \nsuch as job satisfaction or burnout, impact \non patient-care outcomes. In the non-health \nfield, a small number of longitudinal studies \nwere identified that examined the impact of \nintermediate outcomes (mostly average employee \njob satisfaction) on organisational performance. \nWhile the studies in this review show associations, \nthe evidence on the casual direction of this \nrelationship is mixed. This relationship is a \ncrucial link for the premise that HRM influences \nfinal outcomes partially through its impact on \nemployee outcomes such as job satisfaction, and \nwe clearly need more substantial data sets for surer \ninterpretation.\nMeasuring intermediate \noutcomes in the NHS\nThe report presents information on the reliability \nof measures in each of the intermediate outcome \nareas identified for review. Where possible, the \nspecific measures used in the included studies were \nreported on. Where an intermediate outcome area \nwas not covered by the studies included in this \nreview, the subject experts on the research team \nidentified an appropriate measure for inclusion. \nDetails of the measures, their items and reliabilities \nare presented in Chapter 10.\nThese measures represent a basic toolkit that could \nbe used or adapted for future NHS-based research \nof the HRM performance link.\nExecutive summary\nxii\nFuture research foci\nMany of the problems of the studies taken \ncollectively arise from the small-scale funding \nthat characterises social science. Developing a \n\u2018big science\u2019 project that permits repeat surveys, a \nbroad coverage of practices, independent audits \nof practices, and reliable and valid performance \nmeasures would be desirable. Smaller-scale projects \nwould still be useful, for example, to delve into the \nfidelity of implementation issue, but they would \nhave more value if set in the context of bigger \nstudies. Existing data sets, for example, the WERS \nand Healthcare Commission (HCC) staff survey, \ncould be usefully revised to take account of some of \nthe learning from this and other overviews. More \nattention needs to be given to the intermediate \nvariables between HR practices and organisational \nperformance. Thus, multilevel studies that \nembrace the individual, team and organisational \nlevel (and, in the case of the NHS, Trust level) are \nneeded. Finally, studies of interventions aimed at \nimproving HR outcomes and performance should \nbe encouraged, together with a mechanism for \nbringing together researchers and organisations \nbefore the interventions take place. This would \nallow pre- and post-intervention measurement of \nrelevant HRM practices and outcomes.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The key issue \nis what \u2018appropriate\u2019 means in this context, and \nthe evidence on which this can be based. This \nreport presents findings from a series of systematic \nreviews of the literature linking HRM practices \nto performance outcomes in the NHS and wider \norganisational settings. It was commissioned by \nthe National Coordinating Centre for Reseach \nMethodology (now part of the NIHR HTA \nprogramme under the NIHR Methodology Panel) \nand the NIHR Service Delivery and Organisation \n(SDO) Research and Development (R&D) \nProgramme, and the reviews were undertaken \nbetween September 2005 and July 2007.\nFirst, this chapter provides an overview of research \nin the field of HRM, exploring current debates \nand the rationale for the review. It then goes on to \nexplain the research brief and detail the specific \nobjectives for the review. Finally, the structure \nof the report and presentation of findings are \ndescribed.\nContext for the review: \noverview of the literature \non HRM and organisational \nperformance\nFocus on high involvement and \nskill acquisition\nThe Department of Health (www.dh.gov.uk\/en\/\nindex.htm) repeatedly singles out the crucial role \nof skill development, involvement, team working \nand morale to the modernisation of the NHS. In \nthe words of the Department of Health\u2019s website, \n\u2018Successful human resources management improves \nefficiency through a culture that supports and \ndevelops its staff, allowing the workforce to share \nin the organisation\u2019s objectives\u2019 (www.dh.gov.uk\/en\/\nPolicyandguidance\/Humanresourcesandtraining\/\nBuildingpeoplemanagementskills\/index.htm).\nThe evidence offered to support the Department\u2019s \nview that HRM is vital to the NHS is the finding \nthat patient mortality rates improve in acute \nhospitals where an HRM director is a member \nof the Trust Board. In this, the Department of \nHealth is mirroring a more general emphasis \non employee development and involvement as \nkey to maximising the human resource (HR) \ncontribution to strategic objectives of organisations. \nThis high-involvement management and human \ncapital approach to HRM, sometimes referred to \nas \u2018the HRM approach\u2019, has been at the centre \nof the literature for the past two decades. For \nconsistency, we refer to it as \u2018the high-involvement \nmanagement approach\u2019, while acknowledging \nthat not all of those who are referring to modern \nHRM necessarily place empowerment at its core, \nbut rather emphasise the development of human \nskills and knowledge. The term \u2018HRM\u2019 is used \nwhenever a potentially more all-embracing concept \nof personnel management is being considered.\nThe past 20 years have seen increasing attention \ngiven to both the general notion of HRM and \nthe more specific high-involvement management \napproach as a major contributor to organisation \nperformance, even in capital or technologically \nintensive industries. High-involvement \nmanagement is assumed to contribute both in its \nown right and as a support for such other modern \nmanagement practices as total quality management \n(TQM) and just-in-time (JIT). So, in the health \ncontext, high-involvement management adds to \nthe human capital of the workforce and helps \nsupport new modes of organisation, technology \nand patient delivery. Its importance derives from \nan assumption that some forms of personnel \nmanagement \u2013 and, particularly in the current \ncontext, approaches founded on involvement \nand development \u2013 have greater effects on the \ndevelopment, skills and motivation of employees \nthan others.\nMuch of the attention given to the high-\ninvolvement or commitment HRM system has \nbeen advocatory. Contrasting it with a traditional \ncontrol approach (sometimes known as Taylorist \nor Fordist), academics1\u20133 have championed high-\ninvolvement management as a progressive form \nof management that can remove past restrictions \nto both economic efficiency and the achievement \nChapter 1  \nIntroduction\nIntroduction\n2\nof high-quality performance, thereby sharpening \nthe competitive edge of Western organisations \nand improving public sector delivery. They \ncontend that there is a unique set of practices or \napproaches to management that will, regardless \nof the context, outperform all others. Within the \nstrategy literature, the resource-based theory of the \nfirm4\u20136 highlights how human resources, and the \nknowledge embodied in them, may be decisive for \nlong-term competitive advantage. In the operations \nmanagement literature7\u201310 the emphasis is on how \nHRM practices and the knowledge and skills of \nworkers are decisive in exploiting lean production11 \nand other modern management methods (e.g. see \nDean and Bowen12 on TQM).\nResearch evidence\nThe last decade has witnessed a stream of research \nassessing high-involvement management and \nits associated concepts. The basic hypothesis \nunderlying this work is that high-involvement \nHRM systems will have positive effects on \norganisational performance. As academics \nhave sought to move beyond advocacy of high-\ninvolvement systems, they have focused on testing \nthis hypothesis. A spate of research studies in the \n1990s were motivated by this, with many surmising \nthat high-involvement HRM systems do perform \nbest.13\u201320 Several overviews21,22 concluded that, on \nthe basis of the first few studies, the universalistic \nhypothesis is supported. The increasing use of the \nterm \u2018high-performance\u2019 model to describe the set \nof practices may imply that the matter is indeed \nsettled, much as a drug might be named by the \ndisease it is known to cure.\nThe initial overviews of these studies22,23 tended \nto present them in a homogeneous way, taking \nfor granted that they are studying the same \nphenomenon and that the results are broadly \nthe same, concluding they had successfully \ndemonstrated the link between the human capital \napproach and key organisational outcomes. These \nreviews have led some to conclude that the main \nissue now is to explain the link between high-\ninvolvement management and performance, i.e. \nto assess the mechanisms between them or get \ninside the \u2018black box\u2019 between the HRM system \nand outcomes. A second issue might be the extent \nto which the link will be found in all contexts, and \nparticularly in service industries such as health \ncare. The majority of the early studies were in \nmanufacturing, and it is significant that one of the \nfew early studies in services24 found evidence of a \ncontingent relationship between the human capital \napproach and performance, i.e. that the impact \nof human capital will vary between contexts. In \nthe past few years, more studies have either been \nconducted singly in the service sector or included \nthat sector within the scope of the study,15,25\u201327 and \nthe results have been mixed. Studies specifically \non health care are emerging, for example West et \nal.28 have investigated the link between HRM and \npatient mortality.\nAssessing the evidence\nNotwithstanding the above, an increasing number \nof writers question whether the portrayal of the \nstudies as providing conclusive evidence for a \nuniversal link between HRM and performance is \npremature, and that there is a clear need to delve \nmore deeply \u2013 both into the studies and into the \nreality of high-involvement management and its \nlinks to other aspects and methods of management. \nThere are a number of reasons for extending the \ndebate.\nFirst, the results of the various studies are neither \nas clear-cut nor as uniform as some have concluded \n(see Wood,29 particularly table 1 for a summary of \nthe main results; and Wall and Wood30,31). Within \nstudies, there is unevenness in the findings between \nperformance measures; while some results point \nto universal effects, others do not. Moreover, in \nmany studies only the universal hypothesis has \nbeen tested so one cannot rule out the contingency \nargument that the effects of high-involvement \nmanagement on performance are contingent \non a third factor, either a dimension of the \ncontext or the strategy of the organisation, even \nwhen a positive link between high-performance \nmanagement and performance has been found.\nSecond, it is not always clear whether high \ninvolvement or performance management is being \ndefined simply as the combined use of best practice \nin each domain of human resources, as a synergistic \nset of practices, or by a more fundamental \nmanagerial orientation.32 In fact, the discussion so \nfar has begged the question of how we define and \nidentify a system. Most studies have defined an \nHRM system a priori, often with little theoretical \njustification, as the emphasis has been on testing \nthe high involvement\u2013performance link, rather \nthan first investigating the relationship between \npractices or the nature of any systems. Researchers \nhave measured HRM on the basis of differentiating \norganisations by their usage of a set of practices, \nthe precise means varying between studies. Then \nthey correlate these differences with performance \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

With only a few exceptions,33,34 \nstudies have provided insufficient information \nabout which individual or subset of practices has \nthe strongest effects and which may be marginal \nor even irrelevant. In one case13 where this was \ndone, and it was shown that only some of the \npractices affect performance, and, moreover, that \ntheir strength varied between industrial context, \nthough the authors still framed their conclusions \nin terms of an overall (high-performance work) \nsystem yielding superior performance. Aggregating \npractices does not allow one to test whether the \neffects of one practice are enhanced by the use \nof another, i.e. whether they are synergistically \nrelated, and begs the question of whether they tend \nto be used together.32,35\nThird, there is considerable variability across \nstudies in the practices included either in the \nmodel of high-involvement management or the \nset of practices used to test its link to performance. \nSome of the differences are terminological, \nperhaps reflecting disciplinary biases or a quest \nto differentiate one\u2019s wares. But a core difference \nwithin the literature can be identified. On the \none hand are those authors who see the core \nof high-involvement management as changes \nin work organisation, job design and employee \ninvolvement methods (particularly idea capturing), \nwith the other practices acting as supports to \nhelp motivate and equip people to work in a \nnew, more flexible and proactive way. On the \nother hand are those who do not prioritise the \ntask system. They may then concentrate more on \nskill acquisition, following an emphasis on the \nresource-based theory of the firm, according to \nwhich genuine competitive advantage reflects an \norganisation having a unique capability or set of \nresources. Therefore, primacy is placed on the \ncompetencies of individuals, rather than whether \nthey are empowered. Alternatively, they may treat \nhigh-involvement management as entailing the \nuse of the whole gamut of sophisticated personnel \nmanagement methods, and conceive them as \nprimarily operating through people\u2019s commitment \nor sense of whether they are being treated fairly \nand consistent with their psychological contract. \nThe different approaches need not affect \ngreatly the practices researchers include in their \nstudies, but the inclusion of job design and work \norganisation practices is one major source of \ndiversity between the studies, as Wood and Wall31 \nshow. The other major difference is incentive \nsystems, with some studies treating them as part \nof high-involvement management or at least \nperformance management, whereas others do not.\nFourth, there has been insufficient empirical \nexploration of the mechanisms or intervening \nvariables that might explain any link between \nHRM and performance. Of course it must be \nacknowledged that there is little point in investing \nresources in exploring the reasons for a link \nuntil it has been established. Yet, labels such \nas \u2018high commitment\u2019 and \u2018involvement\u2019 imply \ncertain mechanisms that are concerned with the \nextent of commitment or engagement on the \npart of the work force, which is mirrored in the \nimportance given to morale in statements about \nthe modernisation of health care, and these could \nbe explored more than they have been. Much \nof the theoretical justification that precedes the \nempirical studies also implies that skills, knowledge \nand learning might have an independent effect on \nperformance as important as employees\u2019 attitudes.\nSome studies have included intervening variables, \nwhich have either centred on intermediate HR \noutcomes (e.g. labour turnover in Huselid18) \nor on commitment and satisfaction.36,37 Several \nauthors hint at, but do not explore in depth, other \nmechanisms; for example, Guest and Conway38 \nimply that procedural justice may be important. \nIn addition to morale and staff development, \nan important emphasis in statements on the \nmodernisation of health care is what might be \ntermed the strategic integration of individuals into \nthe organisation, so that they both understand \nand share the goals that achieving patient \ncare entails and, consequently, orientate their \nbehaviour towards common visions. Studies \noutside the narrow confines of the HRM studies, \nparticularly building on the job redesign and lean \nproduction literature, point to the importance \nof the kinds of attitudes that advocates of \ntotal quality management and other modern \nmanagement methods highlight, including \nquality consciousness,39 continuous improvement \norientation40 or flexible work orientation.41\nFinally, the majority of studies have concentrated \non a narrow range of HRM practices in isolation, \nthe exception being those that have included \nTQM in their analysis,20,31,34 but there is a general \nfailure to assess the effectiveness of HRM and \nrelated practices relative to both key elements of \nmanagement, such as leadership, and practices \nfurther afield, such as R&D expenditure.\nIntroduction\n4\nIn addition, despite the differences in focus and \nmeasures, most of the studies share a basic research \ndesign, which has a number of weaknesses. These \ninclude:\n\u2022\t The use of cross-sectional designs, which limits \nthe ability to make causal inferences (e.g. \nto decide whether HRM practices promote \nperformance, or rather better performance \nencourages greater investment in HRM).\n\u2022\t A reliance on a single data source (e.g. a chief \nexecutive or HRM director) for information \non HRM practices and performance, which \nmay result in measures of unknown reliability \nand common-method bias (see, for example, \nthe debate between Huselid and Becker42 and \nGerhart et al.43 on the reliability of measures \nbased on single respondents).\n\u2022\t Many have small samples, low response rates \nand concentrate on a limited range of sectors.\nHowever, even the most searching reviews that \nhave highlighted problems in the studies have \nconcluded that there is nonetheless sufficient \npromise in the body of evidence to consider major \ninvestments in the area.30 It is thus timely to invest \nin detailed assessment of what we know.\nReview aim, scope and \nobjectives\nThe overall aim of this series of related systematic \nreviews is to provide a picture of HRM practices \nin use in the UK, to identify evidence on the \nrelationships between HRM practices and a variety \nof individual and organisational outcomes, and to \nassess the reliability of measures of some outcomes \nof HRM.\nThe brief for the review was that its scope should \nbe broad, covering, where feasible, evidence from \nnon-health sectors, although evidence from the \nhealth sector should be emphasised.\nThe objectives of the review (source: NHS\/SDO \nInvitation to Tender 2004) are to:\n1. describe HRM practices and measure the \nfidelity with which they may be implemented\n2. review the reliability of methods of measuring \nparticular intermediate outcomes (intended \noutcomes of HRM that may affect patient care, \ne.g. morale)\n3. review the literature on the correlation of \nintermediate outcomes to each other\n4. investigate the correlation of intermediate \noutcomes with final outcomes\n5. investigate the sensitivity of intermediate \noutcomes to individual HRM practices.\nA pictorial summary of the project and its \nobjectives (adapted from that provided in the \noriginal brief) is shown in Figure 1 (for details of the \nfull proposal see Appendix 1).\nReport\nThis report presents findings from a series of \nsystematic reviews of the relationship between \nHRM practices and performance.

For example, the research literature \ncontains contributions from several disciplines, \nusing different types of research designs, and \nwhat constitutes HRM and performance can \nvary considerably from study to study.

First, the research context \nis considered and the challenges of applying \nsystematic review methodology to the HRM \nliterature are discussed. Next, the systematic \nreview approaches used are explained and the \nspecific questions for the review established. The \ncombinations of search terms and databases used \nare detailed and a summary of the methodological \napproaches used in addressing each of the specific \nresearch questions is presented.\nApplying systematic review \nmethodology within the \nHRM literature\nSystematic review methodology has a very \nlimited pedigree within HRM, which has only \ncomparatively recently begun to adopt some of the \ntools of evidence-based practice.44 Nevertheless, \nsome key studies do exist. For example, Levy \nand Williams45 conducted a systematic review \nof 300 studies examining the social context of \nperformance appraisal and Taris46 examined 16 \nstudies dealing with the burnout\u2013performance \nrelationship. The lack of a significant body of \nexemplars within HRM has limited the capacity of \nthis particular field to develop tailored methods of \nsystematic review and to stimulate methodological \ninnovation in the identification, assessment and \nsynthesis of this type of data. As a consequence, \nthere are very few instances of methodological \npapers on conducting systematic reviews within \nHRM. The review team, therefore, faced a \nnumber of challenges in conducting this series of \nsystematic reviews and in leading the adaptation \nand development of methods to tackle practical \nproblems generated by these review questions. \nThe challenges were compounded by a corpus of \nliterature that conceives the concepts of both HRM \nand performance (and indeed their intersection) \nin different ways, asking comparable but not \nidentical questions, and using different types of \nresearch design. Furthermore, the literature that \nis examined in this review is multidisciplinary and \nheterogeneous. Finally, the review is composed \nof five (subsequently six) distinct and yet related \nobjectives \u2013 not a single well-focused research \nquestion but rather a series of separate and equally \nelusive questions.\nSystematic review was the method of choice \nbecause the methodology offers a number of \nmodels to be applied or modified depending \non the questions being asked. Systematic review \nis an evolving methodology, primarily designed \nto answer questions regarding the effectiveness \nof interventions by synthesising findings from \nlarge numbers of studies. As such systematic \nreviews are \u2018a scientific tool which can be used to \nsummarise, appraise and communicate the results \nand implications of otherwise unmanageable \nquantities of research. They differ from traditional \nreviews and commentaries produced by \u201ccontent \nexperts\u201d in that they use a replicable, scientific and \ntransparent approach that seeks to minimise bias.\u201947 \nSystematic reviews follow a process of constructing \na clearly defined research question with inclusion \nand exclusion criteria, comprehensive searching to \nidentify all relevant literature, quality assessment \nof selected studies, extraction of relevant data from \nthese studies, and synthesis of the study results. In \ncases where there is sufficient similarity in the focus \nof studies, in terms of interventions and outcomes \nresearched, a meta-analysis may be performed: a \nquantitative synthesis. The final result of the review \nis thus a conclusion based on a critical synthesis \nof the comprehensive, unbiased selection and \nappraisal of the best available research examining \nthe topic under consideration, which typically, in \nthe health area, is an intervention.\nThis methodology was originally developed for \nanalysing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical \ninterventions in medicine, based on quantitative \ndata from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). \nSystematic reviews in the medical field now have \nan accepted, standardised methodology.47,48 In \nrecent years, the advantages of systematic review \nover more conventional forms of literature review \nhave been recognised and examples have appeared \nin other fields.49,50 This has led to the piloting and \nChapter 2  \nMethodology\nMethodology\n8\ndevelopment of methodologies for the review of \nqualitative research and the review of literature \nin disciplines, such as the social sciences,51 where \nthere is no accepted hierarchy of study design or \naccepted criteria for quality assessment.52\u201357\nDespite the challenges presented by heterogeneous \ntypes of research, systematic review methods \nare characterised by transparency of approach, \nalong with comprehensiveness, reliability and \nreproducibility of methods and techniques.\nRecent commentators on systematic review \nmethods endorse the adoption of flexible, \nexploratory and reflective approaches, especially \n(as is the case here) when the fields of evidence \nbeing considered are both complex and \nmultidisciplinary.56,58,59 The team therefore \ndecided that rather than adhere strictly to any one \nsystematic review methodology in answering the \ndifferent questions posed by this review a more \nreflective approach should be taken, which would \nallow the development of the methodology as new \nchallenges within the literature were encountered.\nOverview of systematic \nreview methodology\nEach systematic review attempts to follow the \nstandard model:\n\u2022\t consultation exercise to define research \nquestion(s)\n\u2022\t scoping exercise to define elements of research \nquestion (population, intervention, outcomes) \nand establish inclusion criteria\n\u2022\t production of protocol document specifying \npopulation, intervention, outcomes, and \ninclusion\/exclusion criteria (study design, \nquality assessment, language, date)\n\u2022\t identification of potentially relevant literature \n(literature search)\n\u2022\t study selection and quality assessment\n\u2022\t data extraction\n\u2022\t data synthesis.\nThis chapter goes on to describe the broad \nsystematic review approach adopted by this \nresearch. It outlines how each stage of the review \nwas conducted for the series of reviews that were \nundertaken, and ultimately presents a summary of \nthe review questions and methodologies.\nApplying the systematic \nreview methodology\nAs described in Chapter 1, the five primary \nresearch objectives are concerned with the \nevidence at each stage in a model of HRM and \nperformance. The model identifies final outcomes \n(such as patient care and performance) as well as \nintermediate outcomes \u2013 conceptualised as the \nfactors that link HRM practices to final outcomes. \nHence, the review aims to identify evidence on \nthe nature of the causal links between, on the one \nhand, HRM practices and intermediate outcomes \nand, on the other, intermediate and final outcomes. \nHowever, this clear-cut distinction between final \nand intermediate outcomes is not reflected in \nthe literature. The team identified that evidence \ngenerated from studies falling outside the five \nstated objectives would also be informative, namely:\n\u2022\t studies that attempt to examine the whole \nHRM to performance chain, and\n\u2022\t studies that examine the impact of HRM on \nfinal outcomes.\nAs a result, a sixth objective was added to the list:\n\u2022\t to review the literature investigating the impact \nof HRM on final outcomes.\nDeveloping research questions\nGetting the question right is \u2018the most important \nstep in doing a review \u2026 [because] poorly focused \nquestions lead to unclear decisions about what \nresearch to include and how to summarise it\u2019.48 The \nfirst stage is to develop specific research questions \nfor the review.\nThe initial steps for this project involved breaking \ndown the research objectives into their specific \ncomponent questions. The aim was to provide \nquestions that would form the basis of the series \nof systematic reviews that followed. The process \nof formulating precise, answerable questions from \nthe research objectives was achieved through \nconsultation within the team and with the expert \nadvisers.\nThe six research objectives (that is, the five that \nwere originally commissioned and the sixth added \nfollowing consultation with experts) were broken \ndown into 10 specific questions, as shown in Table 1.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Where a \nPICO model has been used in these reviews, it \nis detailed in the specific methodology for that \nchapter.\nScoping exercise\nThe scoping exercise defines key issues for a review \nas clearly as possible in terms of the population, \ninterventions and outcomes to be studied, and \nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria to be applied. \nTogether with the definition of the research \nquestion, this constitutes the \u2018problem formulation \nstage, which involves the development of key \nresearch questions, construction of the definitions \nof the key concepts \u2026 and the establishment of \ninclusion and exclusion criteria for the review\u2019.60\nFor each review, a series of scoping exercises was \nundertaken to identify the best search terms with \nregard to the balance of specificity (relevance) \nand sensitivity (inclusivity). The nature of the \nHRM literature made the identification of specific \nintervention and outcome terms particularly \nchallenging. Chapter 3 details the process of \nidentifying HRM practice terms, and the specific \nintervention and outcome terms used by the \nrespective reviews are given in Chapters 6\u20138.\nDeveloping the protocol\nThe protocol provides an explicit outline and \nplan to be followed by the review. Conventional \nsystematic review methods require that a protocol \ndescribe clearly defined populations, interventions \nand outcomes for the review, and provide details \nof the literature-searching procedure, quality \nassessment, and data extraction and synthesis to \nbe conducted.47 As the outcome of the scoping \nprocess, the protocol specifies the exact content and \nprocesses of the review, from which there should be \nno deviations. It facilitates the performance of the \nreview by itemising exactly what the review does \nand does not include, and specifying the methods \nof quality assessment and synthesis. It should also \nstate any language or geographical restrictions that \nmight lead to bias in the review.61,62\nIt is increasingly recognised that protocols for \nreviews in disciplines where the literature is a less \nknown quantity, i.e. potentially heterogeneous, \nqualitative, and lacking the tradition of a \nrecognised hierarchy of study design and quality \nassessment criteria,54,55,60,63 may be required to be \nbroad, flexible and open to change. In short, as \nEakin and Mykhalovskiy64 suggest, the question is \nMethodology\n10\nto be viewed as a compass rather than an anchor, \ncontinually being enhanced and refined until \ncompletion of the review. Management is typical \nof such a discipline.56 In such cases, it may be \nnecessary to revisit and redefine interventions and \noutcomes in response to findings, and conduct \niterative and purposive searching of the literature \nto address questions that arise or gaps identified in \nthe literature.52,58,60,63 This is often the case where \nthe overall intent of the review is interpretive, \nnot aggregative, and where the terminology and \nconcepts are neither secure nor predefined.65 \nThe starting point, defined by the protocol, can \ntherefore be broad and inclusive, rather than \nnarrow and exclusive, in contrast with that required \nby more traditional systematic reviews.\nIn order to manage the diffuse HRM literature, \nsimple, broad protocols were developed for each \nsearch. Protocols were reviewed regularly during \nthe search process to help shape the eventual body \nof literature included in the data synthesis.\nIdentifying literature\nAfter the scoping exercise, which is naturally \nexploratory, imaginative and purposive, the \napproach adopted is required to become more \nsystematic, transparent and reproducible. A \nliterature search for a review aims \u2018to provide \nas comprehensive a list as possible of primary \nstudies, both published and unpublished, which \nmay be suitable for answering the question posed \nby the review\u2019.47 Systematic review methods \nalmost unequivocally advocate an extensive and \nmultimethod approach to identifying relevant \nliterature. The intention is to identify all published \nand unpublished literature of relevance to the \nreview that satisfies the review\u2019s inclusion criteria. \nThe principal means for achieving this is the \nsearching of electronic databases. Search strategies \nfollow the PICO model, which, as mentioned \npreviously, breaks a search query down into four \nseparate elements: population, intervention, \ncomparator and outcome, a now-standard \napproach within health care.66 Critical in this, was \na time-consuming process designed to identify \nboth the interventions (HRM practices) and the \noutcomes (whether intermediate outcomes, such \nas job satisfaction or final outcomes, such as \nreduction in mortality). The resulting lists and \nclassifications inform most of the subsequent \nquestions. This process is described in more detail \nin Chapter 3 (HRM practices) and Chapters 5 and \n7 (intermediate and final outcomes).\nIdentifying longitudinal studies\nA further component of the review was restriction \nby study design. This was used for sections of \nthe review that sought to establish a causal link \nbetween interventions, in this case HRM practices, \nand either intermediate or final outcomes. While \nlongitudinal studies in themselves do not prove \ncausality, it is widely recognised that longitudinal \nanalyses do provide better evidence for causation \nthan cross-sectional analyses that use the same \nvariables.67,68 Indeed, contemporaneous systematic \nreviews of HRM have reported that they are \nlimited in their ability to draw conclusions by their \ndependence on cross-sectional data.69 The project \nteam decided to limit the searches to longitudinal \nstudy designs only, as the intention was to identify \nthose studies that could demonstrate causal links \nbetween HRM practices and outcomes, rather than \nsimple associations. It is believed that this literature \nwould offer evidence with greater capacity for \nanswering the questions set by this review. No \nlimitations of language were applied in order to \navoid known biases produced by language and \nlocation.61,62 There were no limitations by date \nother than those of the databases themselves.\nOperationalising the search\nFor much of this particular review, only terms \npre-specifying an intervention and an outcome \nwere required. Searches aimed to optimise use of \nfree-text searching and keyword terms, along with \nsynonyms and variant spellings. This improves the \nchances of identifying all literature relevant to a \ntopic, and is particularly necessary within social \nsciences where indexing and abstracting quality \nfalls short of standards encountered within health \ncare.70\nLiterature searching requires more than \ninterrogation of electronic databases with search \nstrategies based on the protocol. It should use \nother formal methods, such as citation tracking \nand scanning the reference lists of selected \npapers, and hand searching of relevant journals. \nInformal methods of study identification can also \nbe utilised, such as personal communications from \npeer reviewers or expert advisors and serendipity. \nSupplementary formal and informal methods may \naccount for many, or even a majority, of studies \nincluded in non-quantitative reviews.52,53,60,63 Such \nadditional approaches are especially valuable if \nconcepts are imprecise or if the literature is widely \ndispersed and inconsistently indexed.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This may reflect \nan increasing understanding of the topic or the \nsubsequent identification of specific questions \nraised by the findings of the review.52,63 Searching \nbecomes an iterative rather than one-off process, \nthe so-called \u2018spiral approach\u2019 as described by \nGrant et al.71 This was often how we had to proceed \nin this review, where pre-defining outcomes \ncould have limited the findings. However, such a \nprocess is still systematic and consistent with the \nprinciples of systematic review methods. All search \nstrategies and sources for all included papers are \ndocumented to make the process transparent, \nauditable and reproducible.\nDeveloping the search terms\nScoping searches were performed using two of \nthe less ambiguous categories from the list of \nHRM practices generated for the review: pay and \ntraining. Even relatively non-sensitive scoping \nsearches of the principal health and psychology \ndatabases (MEDLINE and CINAHL) produced \nlarge numbers of research studies, which, although \nthey used these terms, were not the focus of \nthe review and would provide no data on HR \nperformance linkages. Additionally, the scoping \nsearches indicated that even larger numbers of \ncitations would be retrieved by the more sensitive \nsearches planned for the full review. Table 2 \nprovides an illustration of the number of hits \nfrom three databases using standard and more \nsensitive versions of the pay and training filters. \nThe number of potential HRM categories and \npractices was very large. A complete and formal \nprocess of reciprocal translation to produce a \nmore clearly defined list would have been an \nextremely resource-intensive task and would have \nproduced an unmanageable number of results \nfrom any searches performed. On account of the \nmultifaceted nature of our study, with its multiple \nquestions, it was decided that the approach of \nleading the review by specific HRM interventions \nwas not viable. The original idea of structuring this \nreview by HR intervention was therefore rejected.\nProblems encountered using particular HRM \nterms required an alternative approach to the \nintervention terminology. The team tested the \nviability of constructing an intervention search \nfilter using only generic HRM terms, such as \nhuman resource, HRM, HR and high-performance \nwork practices or management, and database \nkeywords, such as \u2018personnel management\u2019. This \nremoved the problem posed by constructing \nstrategies using potentially non-HRM-related \nterms, such as \u2018training\u2019, \u2018communication\u2019 or \u2018pay\u2019, \nwhich retrieved large numbers of studies and \nwere, arguably, as generic and non-specific as this \noverarching terminology. Scoping searches using \nthis approach produced manageable numbers of \npotentially more relevant studies and, therefore, \nthis method was adopted. The resulting HRM \nsearch strategy is discussed more fully in Chapters \n5\u20137, and example searches are provided in \nAppendices 6 and 7.\nTABLE 2 Results of scoping searches for two HR practices with patient outcomes\nHR \npractice Database Hits\n+ Patient\noutcomes\n\u2013 Comments, \neditorials, letters, \nreviews English only + Longitudinal\nPay systemsa MEDLINE 1350 417 379 367 55\nPay MEDLINE 58,126 7443 6387 5572 1385\nEMBASE 40,179 5882 4873 4213 914\nCINAHL 13,909 1344 1283 1247 209\nTraininga MEDLINE 11,607 939 823 793 163\nTraining MEDLINE 178,806 10,028 8804 8269 1341\nEMBASE 209,317 28,908 21,084 19,283 4001\nCINAHL 9968 1274 1219 1198 160\na Denotes the less sensitive, more specific version of the filter.\nMethodology\n12\nSearch process\nLiterature search strategies were developed and \nperformed by a systematic review information \nspecialist on the following databases: Applied \nSocial Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), \nBritish Nursing Index (BNI), Business Source \nPremier, Campbell Collaboration, Cochrane \nCentral Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), \nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), \nCumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health \nLiterature (CINAHL), Database of Abstracts \nof Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), DH-Data, \nEMBASE, Health Management Information \nConsortium (HMIC), International Bibliography of \nthe Social Sciences (IBSS), King\u2019s Fund database, \nMEDLINE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database \n(NHS EED), National Research Register (NRR), \nPREMEDLINE, PsycINFO, ReFeR, Social Sciences \nCitation Index (SSCI) and Science Citation \nIndex (SCI). Search strings were modified for the \ndifferent databases to take account of the different \nkeywords and thesauri they use. Searching of \nelectronic databases using pre-designed search \nfilters was supplemented by reference tracking of \nselected studies. Searches were conducted in May\/\nJune 2006. Table 3 provides details of the search \nfilters and databases used for different areas of the \nreview.\nUse of generic HRM terms is not ideal in \nidentifying relevant studies. Papers that examined \nan HRM practice, such as employee feedback, \ncould be missed if no mention of human \nresources, personnel or a synonym is made in the \ntitle, abstract or database designated keywords. \nHowever, this was the only way to operationalise \nHRM as a search strategy, given the extensive \nproblems of using single practice terms. This \nsearch string was modified for different databases \nrecognising the different keywords and thesauri \nthey utilise. Additionally, the \u2018HRM\u2019 searches were \nsupplemented by reference tracking and citation \nsearching.\nStudy selection\nThis stage aims to identify articles that \u2018help to \nanswer the questions being addressed by the \nreview\u2019.47 Study selection should be systematic, \nreplicable and free from bias. Sifting is informed \nby criteria reflecting the population, intervention, \noutcome, study design, language and other criteria \ndefined in the protocol. Titles and abstracts of \nretrieved articles are sifted by two reviewers or \nby one reviewer after an acceptable inter-rater \nreliability score is achieved.47 Where a question \nremains over whether or not to include a study it \nis referred to a third reviewer (or a consensus is \nreached by two reviewers).\nConventional systematic review methods \nadvocate the application of a quality threshold \nin determining study inclusion.47 The aim is to \nevaluate the internal validity of studies by assessing \nselection, performance, measurement and attrition \nbias. The intention is to include only those studies \nthat achieve the highest standards of methodology \nand reporting. Many tools or checklists have been \ndeveloped for the critical appraisal of study quality \nbased on study design, but each has limitations \nand there is no accepted standard set of tools.72 \nNevertheless, such tools are principally designed \nfor specific types of medical research; surveys and \ncase studies, for example, are less easily assessed, \nalthough quality assessment checklists have been \ndeveloped.58\nHowever, there is a case for not excluding studies \non the basis of quality, but simply to use assessment \ncriteria to weight the findings of the studies in the \nreview.52,54,55,63,73 Quality assessment may act as a \nguide to interpreting findings and determining \nthe strength of inferences, as well as enabling \nweighting of study results. It has been argued \nthat qualitative studies cannot and should not be \nappraised formally,54,57 and that quality assessments \nmay be evaluating limitations of reporting rather \nthan methodology.74 Quality assessment thus \ndepends on the type of studies being reviewed. \nControversy remains on whether or not to exclude \n\u2018weak papers\u2019.75 In this review assessment of quality \nis used to moderate the messages from included \nresearch, and not as a quality threshold.\nThis review had already imposed a longitudinal \ncriterion on the studies selected for review \u2013 a \nfairly high threshold for studies in the HRM field \n(in which cross-sectional, self-report design is \ncommon). Further weighting of studies by study \ndesign was applied and this is reflected in the \nrelative weight given to the various studies in the \ndata synthesis.\nData extraction\nThis is the process \u2018by which reviewers obtain the \ninformation they need from what is reported by \nprimary investigators\u2019.47 The aim is to collect from \nthe selected studies the most important data for \nanswering the research question.

In this review, synthesis is primarily \ndescriptive and quantitative in recording the \nstudies that meet specific characteristics, and is \naccompanied by a narrative synthesis.76 There \nwere very few studies in this review that addressed \nthe same basic research question (i.e. examining \nthe same relationship or set of relationships) \nprecluding the use of meta-analysis for most \nintervention groups. Narrative synthesis was \nretained to ensure consistent synthesis across all \ninterventions and enabling comparisons to be \nmade.\nSummary of specific \nresearch questions and \nmethodological approaches\nThe review team drew on the most recent \ndevelopments in systematic review methodology \nin identifying and then resolving the challenges of \nthis evidence base.\nA number of different research methods were \nused to identify evidence in relation to each of the \nspecific research questions. This section provides a \nsummary of the methodological approaches used \nin relation to each of the objectives and specific \nresearch questions.\nObjective 1\nObjective 1 is a mapping exercise involving \nboth the identification of the range of HRM \npractices documented in the literature and the \nHRM practices actively reported in use reported \nby management practitioners. It is necessary to \ntriangulate findings from these two sources in order \nto identify any gaps between research and practice.\n\u2022\t Question 1.1 What HRM practices are described \nin the literature?\nMethod Content analysis was performed on \nsix, recent major reviews of HRM practices, \nsupplemented by additional literature identified \nfor Objective 6. Practices were then categorised \nunder broad headings of HRM, using accepted \ndefinitions of these categories, for example work \ndesign, performance management.\n\u2022\t Question 1.2 How widespread is the use of \nHRM practices in UK organisations?\nMethod Evidence was drawn from the best available \nsurveys of HRM practices in the UK. These \nsurveys were identified from the expert knowledge \nof members of the project team, personal \ncommunications from colleagues, and systematic \nsearching of electronic databases and relevant \nwebsites. Surveys were included if they contained \nUK data. They were then weighted according to \nspecific criteria. Results were tabulated.\n\u2022\t Question 1.3 How can the fidelity with which an \nHRM practice is implemented be measured?\nMethod A critical review was undertaken of research \non implementation fidelity and relevant studies \nfrom the field of HRM.

The existing review and meta-analysis \nliterature was identified and reviewed to evaluate \ncorrelations between individual intermediate \noutcomes and final outcomes, such as performance, \nturnover and absenteeism. This literature was \nidentified by a combination of systematic searching \nof electronic databases and reference tracking.\n\u2022\t Question 4.2 What is the evidence for the \nimpact of intermediate outcomes on patient \ncare outcomes?\nMethod Intermediate outcomes were again \nidentified as for Objective 2. The aim was to \nproduce a synthesis of the longitudinal literature \nfor each intermediate outcome as it relates to the \npatient care outcomes identified for this review. \nThis literature was identified by a combination of \nformal methods, such as systematic searching of \nelectronic databases and reference tracking.\nObjective 5\n\u2022\t Question 5.1 Do any HRM practices have \na significant impact on the intermediate \noutcomes identified for this review?\nMethod Again, each intermediate outcome \nidentified under Objective 2 was examined in \na systematic review of the longitudinal HRM \nliterature. This literature was identified from \nObjective 6, Questions 6.1 and 6.2, which included \nlongitudinal research examining the impact of \nHRM practices on various intermediate outcomes. \nA qualitative, narrative synthesis of the literature \nwas produced.\nObjective 6\n\u2022\t Question 6.1 Which HRM practices have an \nimpact on performance outcomes?\nMethod A systematic review was undertaken of \nlongitudinal research examining HRM practices \nand both intermediate and final outcomes. Studies \nwere identified by the systematic searching of \nelectronic databases and reference tracking, and \nby informal methods such as expert advice. The \nliterature was mapped to the category framework \ndeveloped in response to Question 1.1 and a \nqualitative, narrative synthesis of the literature was \nproduced.\n\u2022\t Question 6.2 Which HRM practices have an \nimpact on patient care outcomes?\nMethod A systematic review was undertaken of \nlongitudinal research examining HRM practices \nand their impact on patient-care outcomes.

Specifically, it addresses \nthe first two research questions identified under \nObjective 1 (Question 1.3, on implementation \nfidelity, is dealt with in Chapter 11):\n\u2022\t Objective 1: 1.1 What HRM practices are \ndescribed in the literature?\n\u2022\t Objective 1: 1.2 How widespread is the use of \nHRM practices in UK organisations?\nThe chapter first describes the process by which \nHRM practices were identified, and then goes on \nto report findings on the extent of use of these \npractices in the UK.\nWhat HRM practices are \ndescribed in the literature?\nThis phase of the research sought to audit the main \nHRM practices described in the literature. The aim \nwas to identify a complete list of HRM practices \nto be developed into a search strategy. Data from \nthree sources were used to develop the list.\nStep 1\nThe research team and expert advisers generated \na list of 13 headings. Eleven of these were broad \nHRM categories under which it was anticipated \nthat the majority of individual HRM practices \ncould be grouped, which could then be used as \na framework to shape the reviews. Initial HRM \npractice terms are presented in Table 4.\nIt was recognised from the outset that HRM \npractices were unlikely to all fall into neat \ncategories. In addition to the 11 broad categories \nof HRM practice identified, two further categories \nwere used to group individual practices:\n\u2022\t The \u2018Miscellaneous\u2019 category was used to \ngroup practices that were not subject to direct \nmanipulation by the HR department, or were \nChapter 3  \nHRM practices and their \nreported use in the UK\nTABLE 4 Initial categorisation of HRM\n1 Work design\n2 Training and development\n3 Communication\n4 Single status\/harmonisation\/status differentials\n5 Appraisal\/performance management\n6 Higher-level concepts (HPWPs, HI, HC, etc.)\n7 Administration\n8 Recruitment and selection (including placements)\n9 Compensation and reward systems\n10 Family friendly\n11 Employee representation\/involvement\/participation\n12 Total quality management\n13 Miscellaneous\nHC, high commitment; HI, high involvement; HPWP, \nhigh-performance work practice.\ntoo broad to be influenced by HR policies\/\npractices alone, but were of potential interest \nto the review for their impact on organisational \nor individual performance. Examples include \nbullying\/harassment, socialisation, etc.\n\u2022\t A sizeable number of HR policies\/practices, \n29 in total, were considered to be part of HR \nmaintenance functions (i.e. administration) \nrather than proactive HR practices aimed at \nenhancing performance. Examples include \nequal opportunity, dispute resolution policies, \nand health and safety policies.\nThe classification of HRM practices into broad \ncategories was reviewed by the expert advisers. As a \nresult, the terms were refined according to the most \nappropriate HR category as defined and used in \nthe literature and additional HRM practice terms \nwere suggested, which had not been identified in \nthe review of reviews:\n\u2022\t The higher level concepts category was \nrenamed \u2018bundles\u2019 of practices. Over the last \n10\u201315 years there has been a growing body \nof research on \u2018bundles\u2019 of practices. This \nHRM practices and their reported use in the UK\n18\ncategory was therefore intended to capture \nresearch that focused on combinations of HRM \npractices that were intentionally designed to be \nused in concert as well as for multiple practices \nopportunistically used together.\n\u2022\t Articles in the \u2018Miscellaneous\u2019 category were \nreappraised and either recategorised under \none of the main headings or excluded from \nthis assessment of the main HRM practices \ndescribed in the literature.\nStep 2\nIn a parallel process, a list of HRM practices was \ncompiled from six major recent reviews of the \nHRM literature.30,35,77\u201380 This process identified 245 \npractices.\nA process of reciprocal translation81 was applied \nto the 245 practices identified by the review of \nreviews, with the intention of building a consensus \nabout the main HRM practices covered in the \nliterature. Reciprocal translation involves the \ncomparison of themes across papers and an \nattempt to establish whether there is equivalence \nin the themes of one paper with those from \nanother. The aim is to ensure that a key theme \ncaptures similar policies or practices from different \npapers. In this exercise, the reciprocal translation \nwas approached by two of the researchers \nindependently attempting to compare HRM \npractice terms across review papers and group \nthem under one of the broad HRM categories \nlisted in Table 4.\nInitially, a substantial number of practices did \nnot appear in any of the categories or could be \nallocated to more than one. For example, appraisal-\nbased pay can be seen as a part of the broad HRM \ncategory of appraisal\/performance management \nand of compensation and reward systems. Likewise, \nintroducing autonomous work teams can be seen as \nboth an employee involvement strategy and a work \ndesign approach.\nThe process of reciprocal translation made it \napparent that the same term could be used to \ndescribe different practices in different papers (e.g. \n\u2018goal setting\u2019 to mean performance management \nin one context and employee involvement in \nanother).\nAt this stage in the research, it became apparent \nthat the diffuse nature of the HRM literature, in \nparticular the inconsistency of terminology and the \nblurred boundaries of some of the concepts, meant \nthat the broad categories identified through this \nprocess would not be a suitable as the sole basis \nfor the subsequent review of evidence. Ultimately, \na combination of broader search terms and study \ndesign criteria were used (which are described in \nChapters 2, 5 and 6).\nStep 3\nThe systematic reviews undertaken to meet \nObjectives 3\u20135 generated over 450 papers (see \nChapter 5 for a description of these searches). The \nindividual HR practices, policies or interventions \nthat had been the focus of these studies were \nmapped on to the list of HR practices generated by \nSteps 1 and 2. This was done in order to identify \nany gaps in the list of HR practice terms and \nfurther refine the categories. The exercise revealed \nthat:\n\u2022\t A large body of literature in the health \nsector focused on specific HR practices not \ncommanding much attention in the non-health \nsector \u2013 specifically \u2018working hours\u2019, \u2018staff \nlevels\u2019 and \u2018skill mix\u2019. These practices were \nincluded under the \u2018staffing\u2019 practice category \nalong with selection and recruitment.\n\u2022\t All TQM practices identified (a separate \ncategory on the original list) were, in fact, \ntraining interventions, so were included under \nthe broad \u2018training\u2019 heading.\nThe final list of 10 broad HRM categories is as \nfollows:\n1. work design\n2. staffing\n3. training and development\n4. compensation and rewards\n5. communication\n6. family friendly\n7. single status\/status harmonisation\n8. employee representation, involvement and \nparticipation\n9. appraisal\/performance management\n10. bundles.\nAppendix 2 contains a list of these broad HRM \ncategories with definitions. Appendix 3 presents \nthe specific HRM practices identified in the \nliterature grouped under these 10 broad categories.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

For example, research may \ndemonstrate that a practice has a significant \nbeneficial impact on job satisfaction or patient \noutcomes, while survey data may indicate that \nthis practice is not actually widespread.\nThe first aim is addressed in this chapter and the \nimplications for the overall conclusions of the \nreview are considered in Chapter 11.\nMethods\nFindings from the highest-quality and most \nup-to-date HR surveys were used to generate \nthese data. Surveys were identified using several \nstrategies. The Workplace Employment Relations \nSurvey (WERS) and other survey organisations \nwere identified by members of the project team. \nSearches were conducted to identify appropriate \npublications on the websites of relevant \norganisations, including: Community Innovation \nSurvey (CIS), Continuing Vocational Training \nSurvey (CVTS), European Survey on Working \nTime and Work\u2013Life Balance (ESWT), PASO \n(Panel Survey of Organisations), Employee Direct \nParticipation in Organisational Change (EPOC \nProject), and Workplace and Employee Survey \n(WES) Canada. Searches of the SSCI and King\u2019s \nFund electronic databases were used to identify \nadditional surveys, particularly for the UK health \nsector. Search strategies used combinations of the \nfollowing terms and their variants: survey(s) and \npractice(s) and either human resource(s), staffing, \nwork or personnel. To be included, the survey data \nhad to relate to UK workplaces.\nSurveys were ordered in a hierarchy, based on the \nfollowing quality assessment criteria. The survey \nreported data that:\n1. were weighted and representative of UK \nworkplaces (i.e. data were collected or adjusted \nso that the resulting figures do not simply \nrepresent large organisations or organisations \nfrom particular sectors or industries)\n2. were based on the unit of the workplace (this \ncan be a self-contained entity or a unit of a \nlarger organisation) rather than an individual \nemployee\n3. included the UK public sector and\/or health \nsector.\nData from surveys that were weighted were \npreferred to data from surveys that were not \nrepresentative of UK workplaces but simply \nreported data based on the unit of the workplace. \nData from such surveys were, in turn, preferred to \nthose that simply reported UK private or public \nsector data. If data on a practice were available in a \nsurvey that was weighted and representative of UK \nworkplaces then these data were used in preference \nto data on that practice from a more limited survey.\nResults\nSurveys: a comparison\nSearches identified 18 surveys from 1996 to 2006 \nthat satisfied the criteria. A comparison of included \nsurveys is seen in Table 5. The best available survey \nis the 2004 WERS:82 WERS data were \u2018weighted \nand are representative of [workplaces with 10 or \nmore employees], which accounts for 18% of all \nworkplaces and 80% of all employees in Britain\u2019. \nWith the exception of the Chartered Institute of \nPersonnel and Development (CIPD) surveys on \nperformance pay or rewards, this was also the only \nmajor survey to record data from the public sector, \nand the only survey to compile specific health \nsector data. Therefore, if WERS covered a practice, \nthen only WERS data were used, even if other \nsurveys provided data on the same practice; WERS \nwas considered the best evidence. Where duplicate \ndata existed, those from only the best survey were \nreported.\nThree further surveys also claimed to be \nrepresentative, although they did not acknowledge \nweighting of these data.

In the remaining surveys, CIPD \nmembers were being surveyed rather than actual \nworkplaces, limiting the potential value of these \nsources. Only one specific health sector survey of \nHRM practices was identified by this review.102 The \nstudy reported on a non-representative sample of \ngeneral practices in the UK. Some HRM practices, \nwhich duplicate those covered by other surveys, are \nincluded because this was the only specific health \nservice survey.\nThis section examines evidence on the extent of \nuse of HRM practices among UK employers. As \na result, the focus is on the most recent data for \nany practice rather than on all available data. \nFor example, only the most recent WERS82 data \nwere recorded here. Data from an earlier WERS83 \nsurvey were recorded only if the information was \nnot collected for the subsequent survey. Also, it \nwas outwith the remit of this review to examine \ndevelopments in coverage of practices over time.\nHealth sector-specific surveys\nThe most comprehensive surveys within the health \nsector are those conducted by the Healthcare \nCommission (HCC). Whilst providing extensive \ninformation about staff experiences of working \nwithin the NHS, the annual staff survey differs \nconsiderably from the HR surveys reviewed here in \nthat:\n\u2022\t It is targeted at the individual employee, rather \nthan the HR function.\n\u2022\t It asks questions about individual staff \nperceptions or experiences rather than the \nabsence or presence of specific HR practices.\n\u2022\t The nature of the data means that findings are \nreported at the individual level (i.e. percentage \nof all staff responses to a particular item) \nfor the NHS as a whole, or by type of Trust \n[e.g. all Primary Care Trusts; all Ambulance \nTrusts, etc.], or by Strategic Health Authority, \nor by individual Trust, rather than at the \norganisational level (i.e. percentage of Trusts\/\norganisations reporting the presence of an HR \npractice).\nComparing such data with HR practice measures \nis extremely problematic. For example, the \nproportion of employees reporting that they have \nhad an appraisal in the last 12 months may not \nbear a strong relation to the proportion of NHS \norganisations with appraisal policies in place, or to \nthe existence of an appraisal policy in any specific \norganisation. Accepting these limitations, it is \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

These are a mixture \nof attitudinal and experiential measures, the \nlatter providing an indication of the percentage of \nNHS staff who have experienced a particular HR \npractice (i.e. a proxy indicator).\nWhere a proxy indicator for staff experience of \nan HR policy is available from the National NHS \nSurvey 2007,103 this has been indicated in the right-\nhand column of Table 6. Findings from the survey \nare summarised later (see Table 17) and discussed \nbelow (see Data from the NHS Staff Survey 2007, \nbelow).\nCategorisation of practices\nPractices recorded by HR practice surveys are \nreported using our categories of HRM practices \n(as presented above: see What HRM practices are \ndescribed in the literature?). These groupings are \nused to structure the following tables reporting the \nsurvey data (Tables 7\u201316). Figures in these tables \nrepresent the percentage of workplaces that report \nusing a particular practice. Data are from the \nNational NHS Staff Survey 2007103 as presented \nlater in the chapter (Table 17).\nIndex of tables\n\u2022\t Table 6 Survey coverage of HRM practice use.\n\u2022\t Table 7 Work design.\n\u2022\t Table 8 Staffing: recruitment and selection.\n\u2022\t Table 9 Training and development.\n\u2022\t Table 10 Compensation and rewards.\n\u2022\t Table 11 Communication.\n\u2022\t Table 12 Family friendly\/work\u2013life balance.\n\u2022\t Table 13 Single status\/status harmonisation.\n\u2022\t Table 14 Employee involvement.\n\u2022\t Table 15 Performance management.\n\u2022\t Table 16 \u2018Bundles\u2019 of practices\/HPWPs.\n\u2022\t Table 17 Summary of proxy indicators from \nNational NHS Staff Survey 2007.103\nSummary\nThese surveys provide information on the extent \nto which different HRM practices are used. The \nresults for work organisation practices (team \nworking, job rotation, role empowerment and the \nformality of job descriptions) show that for all of \nthese practices over 70% of the units surveyed, \nthe workplace or company had the practice for \nat least some of the workforce. However, the \nfigures for companies where the entire workforce \nis covered by the practice would be considerably \nlower. For example, in the Wood et al.99 study of \nUK manufacturing firms, 70% of responding \norganisations had team working but only 38% used \nit for the majority of the workforce.\nThe information on staffing is mainly confined \nto whether selection tests are used and whether \nspecific recruitment procedures are used to \nattract minority or discriminated groups, for \nexample disabled or elder workers or whether exit \ninterviews are used. None of these practices shows \nparticularly widespread coverage, with none of \nthe practices being used in more than 50% of the \nunits. Competence tests are used in 46% of the \nworkplaces.\nThere is more information on training where a \nvariety of practices are measured. Most units use \nthe practices that are studied, if only partially. The \nprovision of general training for at least some of \nthe workforce is, as expected, nearly ubiquitous, \nwhereas specific forms of training are used \nsomewhat less.\nIn the case of compensation and rewards, we have \ninformation on types of pay systems and types \nof employee benefits. The pay systems measures \nconcentrate on types of incentive or performance-\nrelated pay, ranging from a general performance \npay measure to specific ones, such as team-based \nor profit-related pay. Some form of performance-\nrelated pay is used in 40% of workplaces, whereas \nteam-based pay is the least used. Employee \nbenefits, such as pension schemes and sick pay, are \nmore widely used, although health insurance is not \nso frequently used.\nCommunication practices concentrate on forms of \ndirect communication, the mechanisms for this, \nand the type of economic information disseminated \nto employees. A large majority of workplaces \nused some form of team briefing, and just over \n50% disclose key information about the financial \nposition of the organisation or investments.\nFamily-friendly practices are covered well in WERS \nand their use varies considerably between practices. \nIn the cases of practices where there is a statutory \nright to provide leave, for example maternity and \npaternity leave, the study focused on the provisions \nbeyond the statutory minimum, for example paid \nleave.

The \nusage of such practices varies considerably but in \nno case are they used in a majority of workplaces.\nInformation on performance management \nfocuses exclusively on appraisal. The majority of \nworkplaces have some form of appraisal, but only \na minority (27% in WERS) do it more than once a \nyear.\nSeparate figures for the health sector are available \nfor only a small number of the practices (Tables \n7\u201316, column 3), and indeed for the majority of \nHRM categories (e.g. family-friendly practices) we \nhave no such data. For those for which we have \ndata, in the majority of cases the frequency of \nuse in the health sector is not that different from \nthe overall use, and in most cases is even more \nsimilar to the use in the public sector. The two \nexceptions are related to trade unions. The first is \nthe determination of pay by collective bargaining, \nas this exists in 82% of public workplaces but only \nin 36% of health sector workplaces and 14% of the \nprivate sector. The second is union recognition, \nwhich is granted in 90% of public workplaces, \n41% of health sector workplaces, and only 16% of \nprivate sector workplaces.\nAlthough evidence is reported on some HRM \npractices within each of the broad categories \nincluded in this review, the survey coverage is by no \nmeans comprehensive. It is clear from these results \nthat crucial elements of the HRM system are not \ncovered by a lot of the surveys.\nData from the NHS Staff Survey \n2007\nData from the NHS Staff Survey103 is presented \nin Table 17. Caution is needed when considering \nthese data in relation to the data on HR practices \nin general. The NHS data shows the proportion \nof NHS staff who report work experiences that \nare consistent with the HR practices considered \nhere. It is not, however, indicative of the number \nof Trusts in which such HR policies\/practices exist, \nnor does it help address other important questions \nraised in this section, such as the percentage of the \nworkforce covered by a particular HR practice in a \ngiven organisation.\nAccepting the limitations of the NHS Staff Survey103 \ndata in relation to the focus of this chapter, it can \nbe considered as providing proxy indicators of staff \nexperiences in areas. This is of particular interest \nwhere organisational level HR practice data are not \navailable.\nSpecifically the NHS Staff Survey103 data indicate \nthat 39% of NHS employees work in a well-\nstructured team environment. This contrasts \nwith data from the survey of HR practices, which \nindicate that 72% of all organisations surveyed \nhave some employees working in teams and 79% of \nhealth sector organisations make some use of team \nworking.\nWith regard to training, 54% of employers \nsurveyed on HR practices had funded or arranged \nsome training over the previous 12 months. \nNo breakdown is available for health sector \norganisations, but 94% of NHS employees report \ntaking part in some form of training over the \nprevious 12 months. Eighty-one per cent of \nemployers from the HR practice surveys provided \njob specific training and 80% health and safety \ntraining. From the NHS Staff Survey, 77% of staff \nreported receiving job relevant training, 71% \nhealth and safety training.\nThere are no health sector-specific breakdowns \navailable for the wide range of communication \npractices covered by the HR practice surveys. \nThe NHS staff survey indicates that 23% of \nNHS employees feel that senior management \ncommunicate effectively with staff.\nNo breakdown is available for the percentage of \nhealth sector employers offering family friendly\/\nwork\u2013life balance HR practice; however, the NHS \nStaff Survey103 indicates that between 2% and 32% \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n49\nof NHS employees make use of one of a range \nof specific practices in this area, with 73% of all \nemployees reporting that they use flexible working \noptions.\nEighty-nine per cent of health sector organisations \nreport having an equal opportunities policy in \nplace, but no further breakdown of specific HR \npractices in this area is available. Thirty-nine per \ncent of NHS employees report receiving some \nform of diversity training. Levels of training in \nage, disability, gender, race, sexual orientation or \nreligion-related equality\/diversity range from 14% \nto 18% of employees surveyed.\nWith regard to employee involvement, there is \nsome evidence from HR practice surveys in relation \nto health sector organisations. This mainly relates \nto union membership and joint consultative \ncommittees (Table 14). No breakdown is available \nfor the percentage of health sector organisations \nusing other employee involvement HR practices \n(such as suggestion schemes or problem-solving \ngroups). Findings from the NHS Staff Survey103 \nindicate that 23% of NHS employees feel that \nsenior managers try to involve staff in important \ndecisions and 31% feel that senior managers \nencourage staff to make suggestions to improve \nservices.\nWith regard to direct participation, 48% of NHS \nstaff surveyed felt that they were involved in \ndecision-making, and\/or consulted about decisions \nthat affected them.\nFinally, with regard to performance management, \n89% of health sector employers reported using \nperformance appraisals (compared with 71% for \nall organisations). From the NHS Staff Survey, \n61% of respondents said that they had received an \nappraisal in the previous 12 months. Interestingly, \nthis drops to 24% when factors indicating a well-\nstructured performance appraisal were taken into \naccount. Fifty-two per cent of staff (as measured by \nthe NHS Staff Survey103) reported that they agreed \na personal development plan (PDP) as part of their \nappraisal.\nConclusion\nHuman resource practice surveys and the NHS \nStaff Survey cover some common themes. NHS \nStaff Survey103 data help to supplement the picture \nprovided by organisational level surveys of HR \npractices by demonstrating the degree to which \nNHS employees in general may experience the \nresults of HR practices in place in organisations. \nSome of the NHS Staff Survey data provide better \nproxy indicators than others (e.g. evidence of a \nPDP) and receiving training identified in a PDP \nare arguably stronger indicators of the existence \nof a specific HR practice in relation to appraisal \nand development than, say, the extent to which \nperceptions of the quality of communication \nbetween senior managers and staff indicate the \nexistence of an HR communication practice.\nResponses to the NHS Staff Survey103 at an \nindividual Trust level can help that Trust to assess \nthe effectiveness of a range of HR practices within \nthe organisation. Further breakdown of WERS \ndata to reveal the extent of HR practices in the \nhealth sector would enable more meaningful \ncomparisons to be made between data collected at \nthe organisational level and individual data such as \nthe NHS Staff Survey. Equally, systematic collection \nof HR practice data at Trust level would enable \nmore detailed analysis to identify the presence and \neffectiveness of such practices.\n\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Implementation fidelity relates to \nthe fidelity with which both policies and research-\nbased interventions are implemented by those \nresponsible for delivering them. In this case, the \nconcern was for the fidelity with which real-world \nHRM policies are implemented as practices. The \naim was to understand better how knowledge about \nthe effectiveness of HRM practices, evaluated \nand reported in previous sections, may best be \ntransferred into practice.\nCertain practices have been found by this report \nto be effective, for example in reducing mortality \nrates or patient waiting times, but these practices \nmay only have the same potential effect when \nreproduced by policy-makers and practitioners if \nthey are implemented properly, as they should be, \ni.e. with high fidelity to the original practices or \ninterventions examined in the research.\nThis section reviews existing literature on this \nconcept and measurement of fidelity, with the aim \nof understanding the process of implementation \nfidelity and thus informing and improving \nthe success with which HRM policies may be \nimplemented. With this in mind, the report \nwas also required to provide guidance on how \nfidelity could be measured, and to produce \na \u2018checklist of actions, which an auditor for a \nresource management method, such as Investors \nin People, would use\u2019, i.e. a checklist to be followed \nby those seeking to evaluate fidelity (ITT). The \nguidance was intended to inform implementation \nby outlining questions that need to be asked at \nevery stage in the process if high fidelity is to be \nachieved. A tool to evaluate the fidelity with which \npolicies have been implemented is provided as \na checklist. This evaluation could be undertaken \nby researchers, policy-makers or practitioners, or \nanyone seeking to assess whether a policy has been \nimplemented properly in practice, i.e. as intended \nby those designing and seeking to deliver the \npolicy.\nThis section reviews the literature on \n\u2018implementation fidelity\u2019, develops a framework for \nunderstanding and explaining processes at work in \nevaluating and achieving implementation fidelity, \nand places this evidence and framework within the \ncontext of HRM and policy. Subsequent guidance \noutlines questions to be asked when implementing \na policy. A checklist is presented for evaluating \nand explaining the degree of fidelity achieved in \nimplementation of any such policy.\nPolicy\u2013practice link and \nimplementation fidelity\nThere is no shortage of research evaluating the \nimpact of HRM practices on performance amid \ngrowing awareness of the need for evidence-based \npractice.57 However, if a practice of demonstrated \neffectiveness is to have a positive impact it needs \nto be implemented faithfully. This idea is captured \nby the concept of implementation fidelity: \u2018the \ndegree to which \u2026 programs are implemented \n\u2026 as intended by the program developers\u2019.104 \nUnless an evaluation assesses whether a policy \nhas been implemented properly, it is not possible \nto know whether lack of impact is due to poor \nimplementation, (a so-called \u2018Type III error\u2019),105 \nand covered by the \u2018thesis of comprehensiveness\u2019,106 \nor inadequacies of the policy itself. Also, it would \nbe unclear whether positive outcomes produced \nby a policy could be improved still further, if the \npolicy had in fact not been implemented fully.\nMonitoring of fidelity is of particular concern \nin HRM because of a long-standing concern \nabout the gap between organisational HR policy \nprescriptions and actual practice.107 Several scholars \nascribe to poor implementation the divide between \nespoused people-management policies and the \nreality experienced by employees subject to the \npolicies.107\u2013110\nThis section critically reviews the literature on \nimplementation fidelity and considers the concept \nin relation to the implementation of policies in \nHRM. It begins by examining existing descriptions \nof a model of implementation fidelity. This is \nfollowed by a review of research that specifically \nChapter 4  \nImplementation fidelity in HRM\nImplementation\u2002fidelity\u2002in\u2002HRM\n52\nuses the term \u2018implementation fidelity\u2019 and uses \nthis concept to evaluate the implementation and \neffect of interventions. This literature focuses on \ninterventions to help and support people with \nmental health problems, criminal behaviour or \naddiction issues. This research provides examples \nof how to measure implementation, describes \nhow to achieve high levels of fidelity and, in some \ncases, evaluates associations between level of \nimplementation fidelity and the actual impact of an \nintervention. The concept of fidelity is then applied \nto HRM policy, both as a model and with reference \nto existing HRM \u2018rhetoric versus reality\u2019 literature, \nwhich deals with some elements of implementation \nfidelity, although it is less sophisticated and uses \ndifferent terms. Finally, a new framework for \nunderstanding the process of evaluating fidelity is \nproposed. This framework is then used to develop \nguidance on evaluating fidelity, and a checklist for \nassessing the degree of fidelity with which a policy \nhas been implemented.\nDimensions of fidelity\nIn the literature that specifically names and \ndiscusses the concept, implementation fidelity \nis described in terms of \u2018five dimensions\u2019 or \n\u2018components\u2019.104,111\u2013113 These are adherence to a \npolicy or intervention, dose, quality of delivery, \nparticipant responsiveness, and programme \ndifferentiation.\nWithin this framework, adherence is defined as \nwhether a policy, practice, service or intervention \nis being delivered as it was designed or written\u2019.111 \nDosage refers to the amount of a practice received \nby participants, in other words, whether the \nfrequency and duration of the practice is as full as \nintended.104,111 It may be, for example, that not all \nof the aspects of a HRM practice are delivered or \nare delivered but not as often as required. Quality \nof delivery has been defined as \u2018the manner \nin which a teacher, volunteer or staff member \ndelivers a program\u2019.111 Participant responsiveness \nis \u2018the extent to which participants are engaged \nby and involved in the activities and content of \na program\u2019.104 Programme differentiation, the \nfifth dimension, is defined as \u2018identifying unique \nfeatures of different components or programs\u2019 and \n\u2018which elements of \u2026 programs are essential\u2019.104 \nThere are certain overlaps here with the concept of \nprocess evaluation.114\nTwo other issues need to be addressed. The first \nis implementation over time. Implementation of \nan HRM policy may not be a simple one-stage \nprocess; it may take time to be implemented \nfully and, once it has been implemented, this \nlevel of implementation needs to be sustained. \nImplementation therefore requires ongoing \nmonitoring and support.54 Few studies examine \nhow to sustain implementation over time. The \nsecond issue concerns the appropriateness \nof adaptations to fit \u2018local\u2019 conditions. Some \nspecifications allow for local adaptation or, even \nif they do not explicitly do this, local adaptations \nmay aim to improve a practice so that it fits more \nwith the local context. Indeed, Blakely et al.115 refer \nto a proadaptation perspective that implies that \nsuccessful interventions are those that adapt to \nlocal needs. Yet, others argue that the case for local \nadaptation may well have been exaggerated, where \nthe evidence does not necessarily support it.116 \nThe intermediate position is that implementation \ncan be flexible as long as there is fidelity to the \nessential elements, the absence of which would \nadversely affect the capacity of the practice to \nachieve its goals, and without which the policy \ncannot be said to have been implemented in any \nmeaningful fashion.104,111,112 However, the question \nremains about how to identify such essential \nelements. Possible options are either canvassing \nopinions of the practice designers themselves, or \nconducting a sensitivity analysis or evaluation to \ndetermine which components are most vital to its \neffectiveness. To date only the more unreliable \nformer method has been used to identify such \nelements, and limitations of this approach are \nacknowledged.116\u2013118 What is more, there is a \ngrowing appreciation that implementation data \nshould accompany research on the effectiveness \nof interventions to facilitate their proper \nimplementation.119,120 This involves specification \nof the essential components of an intervention or \nHRM practice because this defines exactly what \nneeds to be implemented.\nOverview of findings from \nfidelity studies in social \npolicy\nThere is a growing body of literature on \nimplementation fidelity. Studies summarised \nin Table 18 are a sample of those published \nsince the reviews conducted by Dusenbury et \nal.104 and Mihalic.111,112 This literature focuses on \ninterventions to help and support people with \nphysical and mental health problems, criminal or \nantisocial behaviour, or addiction issues.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Forgatch et al.117 have demonstrated how the \nlevel of implementation fidelity to a parent training \nprogramme, designed to improve interaction \nbetween parents and stepchildren, predicted the \nlevel of improvement in parenting practices.\nResnick et al.125 found that employment outcomes \namong people with mental health issues \u2018were \nweakest for those in poorly implemented Intensive \nPsychiatric Community Care (IPCC) programs\u2019 \n(p. 142). The same correlation was found in a \nsimilar study by McGrew and Griss,127 which also \nlooked at supported employment programmes. \nResnick et al.122 also found that participant \noutcomes were good when fidelity to an exercise \nprogramme was high, but no cases of low fidelity \nwere present in this study, so a positive correlation \ncould not be confirmed. The number of studies \nevaluating this association is small, but this research \ndoes indicate that the degree of fidelity with which \na policy or intervention is implemented will be a \nfactor in its achievement of successful outcomes.\nResearch has also found that detailed or specific \npolicies are more likely to be implemented \nwith high fidelity than those that are vague. \nFor example, well-planned violence protection \ninterventions, where all the key components \nare identified in advance, have been found to \nproduce higher levels of adherence than less well-\nstructured interventions.112 Specificity enhances \ndelivery. Indeed, by far the majority of policies and \ninterventions implemented in our sample are very \ndetailed and are based on published models (Table \n18: Source of data 1). In one case where the source \nis unclear,121 strategies to support implementation \nfidelity, for example guidelines, suggest that a \nhighly specific model is behind the intervention. \nHigh specificity may be prerequisite to meaningful \nmeasurement.\nSpecificity does not mean complexity. A policy \nor intervention can be specific but simple, and \nthere is evidence that it is easier to achieve high \nfidelity of simple guidelines or policies with \nfewer \u2018response barriers\u2019 than complex ones.54,104 \nFor example, a study of guidelines intended for \ngeneral practitioners (GPs) found that detailed \nand clear recommendations were almost twice \nas likely to be followed as vague and complex \nrecommendations.137 Generally, research indicates \nthat simple but specific policies or interventions \nare more likely to be implemented with high \nfidelity than complex or vague ones. As such, \nthe comprehensiveness and nature of an HRM \npolicy\u2019s description may moderate how far the \nimplemented practice actually adheres to the \npolicy.\nTwo further points are raised by this research. \nFirstly, the level of implementation fidelity is not \ndetermined purely by the simplicity or specificity \nof a policy or intervention, strategies are usually \nemployed to facilitate the achievement of the \nhighest possible fidelity. Seven of the studies \nreviewed here report the employment of strategies \nto support adherence to the policy or intervention \nas it was designed, and to ensure high quality of \ndelivery. In some cases, these strategies include \nongoing monitoring and feedback to ensure \ncontinuing adherence and quality of delivery \nover time.116,121,122 Monitoring such as this exists \nnot only to optimise, but also to standardise \nimplementation fidelity, i.e. to ensure that everyone \nis receiving not only the most effective training or \nsupport to aid implementation, but also exactly \nthe same training.138 These studies aim not only \nto evaluate fidelity, but also to achieve the highest \nfidelity possible. However, the potential role of \nthese strategies in implementation fidelity has \nnot been considered by research. It is possible \nthat these strategies, like the nature of a policy \nor intervention\u2019s description, may potentially \nmoderate the degree of adherence: the more that is \ndone to help implementation, through guidelines, \ntraining, support and monitoring, the higher \nthe level of fidelity achieved. This is especially \nthe case for complex interventions, which can be \nmultifaceted and more vulnerable to variation \nin their implementation.139 The role of such \nstrategies in optimising fidelity and standardising \nwhat is being implemented arguably is even more \nimportant in this case, and even more likely to \ninfluence the level of fidelity achieved. However, \nthere is currently no research to confirm the \npotentially important role of facilitation strategies \nas moderators of the relationship between policies \nand actual implemented practices, but they should \nbe considered as such.\nSecondly, there is no generic measure of fidelity. \nAll of the studies used different measures. In each \ncase the content of measures is determined by the \ncontent or description of the HRM practice or \nImplementation\u2002fidelity\u2002in\u2002HRM\n56 TA\nB\nLE\n 1\n9 \nSt\nud\nie\ns\u2002\nm\nea\nsu\nrin\ng\u2002\nim\npl\nem\nen\nta\ntio\nn\u2002\nfid\nel\nity\nSt\nud\ny\nH\no\nw\n fi\nd\nel\nit\ny \nis\n m\nea\nsu\nre\nd\nSo\nur\nce\n o\nf d\nat\na \n2\nD\nim\nen\nsi\no\nn\ns \no\nf \nfi\nd\nel\nit\ny \n(D\nus\nen\nbu\nry\n e\nt \nal\n. 2\n00\n3)\n10\n4\nV\nal\nid\nit\ny \nan\nd \nre\nlia\nbi\nlit\ny \nof\n \nm\nea\nsu\nre\ns\nR\nes\nul\nts\nFo\nrg\nat\nch\n e\nt a\nl. \n(2\n00\n5)\n11\n7\nFI\nM\nP\nIn\nde\npe\nnd\nen\nt \nob\nse\nrv\nat\nio\nn \nby\n F\nIM\nP \nra\nte\nrs\n o\nf v\nid\neo\n-\nta\npe\nd \nse\nss\nio\nns\nA\ndh\ner\nen\nce\nQ\nua\nlit\ny \nof\n d\nel\niv\ner\ny \n(\u2018c\nom\npe\nte\nnt\n \nex\nec\nut\nio\nn\u2019\n) \n(p\n. 3\n)\nPr\ned\nic\ntiv\ne \nva\nlid\nit\ny\nIn\nte\nr-\nra\nte\nr \nre\nlia\nbi\nlit\ny \nfo\nr \nFI\nM\nP\nSe\ne \nal\nso\n K\nnu\nts\non\n e\nt a\nl. \n(2\n00\n3)\n13\n4\nH\nig\nh \nim\npl\nem\nen\nta\nti\non\n fi\nde\nlit\ny \nas\nso\nci\nat\ned\n w\nith\n m\nor\ne \nef\nfe\nct\niv\ne \npa\nre\nnt\nin\ng \nin\nde\npe\nnd\nen\nt \nof\n s\npe\nci\nfie\nd \nva\nri\nab\nle\ns\nO\n\u2019B\nri\nen\n \n(2\n00\n5)\n12\n1\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\n a\nre\n p\ner\nce\niv\ned\n \nto\n b\ne \nin\ndi\nca\ntiv\ne \nof\n le\nve\nl o\nf \nim\npl\nem\nen\nta\nti\non\n fi\nde\nlit\ny \n(p\n. \n24\n6)\nM\nea\nsu\nre\ns \nre\nla\nte\n t\no \nm\nat\ner\nna\nl \nan\nd \nch\nild\n fu\nnc\ntio\nni\nng\n.

For example, \nthe Individual Placement and Support Scale (IPS \nFidelity Scale) was developed to measure fidelity \nto interventions that were designed to help people \nwith mental health issues into employment,127 and \nthe service delivery tracking log, completed by \nsocial workers, was used to monitor implementation \nof an intervention to protect children potentially \nat risk.124 Two other studies evaluated fidelity using \noutcomes: they assumed that positive outcomes are \na proxy for high fidelity of implementation,121,123 \nwhich, in effect, negates the primary reason for \nassessing fidelity, i.e. to see if it moderates the link \nbetween policy and outcomes.\nData collection on fidelity involves independent \nobservation or reporting in four of the studies, and \nthe self-report of staff delivering or participants \nreceiving the intervention in the remaining seven \nstudies. The measurement of fidelity in two studies \ncombines data from independent observers with \ndata from staff and participants. Independent \nobservation of delivery offers the best source of \ndata about both adherence and quality of delivery. \nSix of the eleven studies give validity and reliability \ninformation on the scales used. Three studies aim \nto measure whether the \u2018essential\u2019 elements of the \nintervention or practice have been implemented, \nwith the opinions of experts being used to identify \nthese elements.116\u2013118\nThe implementation fidelity measures applied by \nthis research literature are intervention specific and \nheterogeneous in their data collection methods, \nbut they all seek to measure implementation \nfidelity by measuring adherence, and have as their \nstarting point highly specific descriptions of their \ninterventions. They also aim to achieve high levels \nof fidelity by employing similar support strategies, \nand seek to provide accurate measurement \nof implementation fidelity. However, none \nexamines whether any of the following may have \na moderating effect; the complexity or simplicity \nof the interventions\u2019 descriptions; strategies to \nfacilitate implementation, quality of delivery; or the \nresponsiveness of participants.\nFidelity of HR policy\nOrganisations establish HRM policies, and \noccasional change programmes, which may become \nembedded in policy. Typically, such policies and \nprogrammes involve installing new practices or \nmaintaining central activities or approaches within \ncore areas of HRM, for example recruitment and \nselection, training, employee involvement, and \nequal opportunities. Assessing their fidelity is about \ngauging whether policies are implemented fully as \npractices.\nAdherence is then about assessing whether \npractices are implemented in accordance with \npolicy. \u2018Dosage\u2019 refers to ensuring that all aspects \nof the policy are covered, and all employees and \nsites to be covered by a particular element are \nactually involved in it. They must also be exposed \nto it as frequently, and for as long, as prescribed \nby policy. \u2018Quality of delivery\u2019 refers to how well \nthe practice is delivered or performed by those \nresponsible for doing so. For example, a policy may \nprescribe that training is delivered by specialist \ntrainers and involve feedback on quality from \nparticipants. In this sense, quality of delivery is \npart of implementation adherence. Alternatively, \na policy may simply state that training in a \nparticular skill should be given to all new members \nof staff but make no specific prescriptions to \nguarantee the quality of the training. Quality of \ndelivery is therefore no longer a dimension of \nimplementation fidelity, an element of adherence, \nbut rather a moderator of the relationship \nbetween a policy and successful implementation. \nParticipant responsiveness concerns the reaction \nof employees to the practices. It may involve \nassessing whether employees are engaged in each \nelement of the practice to the extent that they \nshould be, and as such may also moderate the \nimplementation\u2013outcome relationship. Programme \ndifferentiation is relevant if certain components \nare core. For example, if employee involvement is \nkey to an HRM policy we would naturally expect \npractices associated with the high-involvement \nmodel to be used. Other practices may include \nsupporting training programmes. A \u2018programme \ndifferentiation\u2019 analysis, to use the earlier \nterminology, may reveal that supporting practices \nare just as important as core practices, or that \ntheir delivery is a vital adjunct if the core practices \nare to have an impact. Indeed, within employee \ninvolvement it is widely recognised that the not-\nso-essential practices support the essential ones, \nand hence are necessary if the performance effects \nof the policy are to be realised. In effect they are \npractices that ensure the quality of its delivery.\nAs with all evaluations, an assessment of the fidelity \nof policies is an important complement to the \nImplementation\u2002fidelity\u2002in\u2002HRM\n60\nevaluation of its impact. However, there are several \nother reasons why it is important to assess the \nfidelity of HRM policies and practices.\nFirst, the issue of policy implementation may \ncontain interesting questions in its own right \nprecisely because adherence is not such a \nstraightforward matter. Policy-makers themselves \nwould no doubt value understanding the \norganisational processes through which policies are \nimplemented and the factors (organisational, group \nand individual) that may facilitate and impede \nimplementation fidelity. For example, Cunningham \net al.107 in an analysis of four case studies, identified \na range of factors that militated against the \nimplementation of a policy on job security for \nill workers. These included contradictory policy \nrequirements, weakness in training, and various \nwork and budgetary pressures. Implementation \nfidelity is therefore inherently important in \nunderstanding and evaluating how HRM policies \nare implemented.\nSecond, non-adherence to a policy may adversely \naffect employees. For example, if an organisation \nhas a policy of paying high wages but does not give \nout wage increases, employees\u2019 pay satisfaction and \nperception of trust in their employer may decline \nand affect their performance or commitment to the \norganisation. It is often claimed that management \nespouses policies that they do not operationalise \nfully, or even at all, precisely because the policies \nare designed to make them appear employee-\ncentred but their implementation falls considerably \nshort of the implied aspiration. This claim often \nfalls under the rhetoric-versus-reality label107,140 \nand is applied especially to employee involvement \nand equal opportunities, but also sometimes to \nTQM. For some employees, perhaps especially \nmanagement, this policy infidelity may affect their \nmorale and commitment. Indeed, the disparity \nbetween an organisation\u2019s practice and its professed \nvalues may be one possible cause of burnout or \ndisengagement amongst employees.\nFinally, policies are important because they drive \nand shape practices, and should be accompanied \nby strategies to achieve adherence. As a result, \npolicies may also ensure that a practice is \nimplemented well, i.e. the quality of delivery is \nhigh. One problem that has to be faced, however, \nis that the lower the level of specificity the greater \nthe possibility that the policy will be adhered to, \non the grounds that it is easier for practice to fall \nwithin parameters that are broad, or at least to \nappear to be within them when they are opaque. \nThis implies that the effect of fidelity on outcomes \nof policies will be moderated by the level of \nspecificity of a policy. Alternatively, it may be the \ncase that low specificity leads to non-adherence, \nbecause if policies are vague they can be easily \nneglected, even allowing for the implied ease at \nwhich it might be met. In the extreme, policies may \nbe so vague as to contain no clear intentions in \nwhich case assessing the policy against intentions \nis not possible. In less extreme cases, where some \nintentions can be inferred, little of interest may \nemerge from an assessment of the implementation \nfidelity of a vague policy.\nIn HRM, policies are often not clearly specified if \nthey exist at all. They are often not self-contained, \nhave evolved incrementally and statements only \nrefer to the most salient, perhaps most novel, \nfeatures. Other elements are taken for granted \nor left unspecified. Modern managerialism may \nencourage policy-makers and managers to develop \npolicy statements that simply convey homilies and \nexhortations to go in a particular direction.141\nCertainly, the presence of a policy should not be \ninferred from HR practices, and, in the same way, \nthe presence of practices should not be inferred \nfrom the existence of a policy. Indeed, this is a \nrecognised issue in HRM research.142\u2013144 As a result \nresearch increasingly looks to measure practices by \ncollecting data from multiple sources rather than \nrelying on a single managerial respondent, whose \nresponse about uptake may be determined by their \nknowledge of policy rather than practice.\nAs a consequence, most recent HRM research \nconcentrates on practices and not policies or \nprogrammes. More specifically, attempts to link \nHRM to performance, i.e. gauge its impact, focus \non practices, perhaps because of the problems of \nvagueness surrounding policies or because small \nand medium firms may well not have formal \npolicies, or simply because they want to focus \non what organisations do rather than what they \nprofess to do. Some studies measure HR practices \nby coverage, i.e. the proportion of staff covered \nby a practice, but if we do not have information \nabout the level of coverage stated in any policy \nthen we cannot use it as a measure of dosage. For \nexample, a practice may cover 60% of staff. This is \nthe measure of the coverage of a practice, typically \nassessed by surveys, such as the figures reported \nabove. However, if a practice is found to cover \n60% of staff but should in fact cover 100%, i.e. all \nstaff then it becomes a measure of implementation \nfidelity because this suggests that the organisation \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n61\nhas an acknowledged benchmark for the practice, \nperhaps provided by written policy.\nIt may even be possible to employ theoretical \nor model benchmarks against which to measure \nadherence. For example, if an organisation \nclaims to be using TQM then seeing whether \nreported practices adhere to the accepted model \nof TQM could offer a measure of implementation \nfidelity.34,144 However, the danger is that the \nbenchmark is a pure \u2018textbook\u2019 model that is \nunlikely ever to be implemented in this form. \nNonetheless, Patterson et al.34 successfully audited \ncompanies against pre-determined definitions \nof \u2018good practice\u2019 for advanced manufacturing \ntechnologies, TQM, JIT, job enrichment and skill \nenhancement, and, in so doing, circumnavigated \nthe implementation problem by assuming that \nthe measures reflected both the existence and the \neffective use of a practice.\nFinally, the question that naturally follows \nan assessment of how fully a policy has been \nimplemented concerns the effectiveness of the \nresulting practice. Only two studies have sought \nto measure effective implementation in the HRM \nfield.145,146 Khilji and Wang145 argued that high \nlevels of implementation of practices correlate \nwith high levels of performance, with satisfaction \nas a mediator. However, this study only compared \nmanager and employee perceptions rather than \nactual implementation fidelity and assumed \nthat satisfaction was a recognised mediator of \nthe relationship between implemented practice \nand performance, the practices being the prior \nvariable. The study was also unable to determine \nthe direction of causality in these relationships. \nAnother study aimed to measure how well HRM \npractices were implemented by measuring \noutcomes: successful outcomes implied successful \nimplementation or practices.146 This relationship \ncannot be assumed, however. On the whole, \nstudies have ignored whether how well practices \nare implemented affects outcomes, and simply \nconcentrated instead on studying the effects of the \nadoption of practices, regardless of how well they \nare implemented.\nIn the field of HRM, few studies have collected \nand evaluated data on the implementation \nof policy (Table 20), the equivalent of the \ninterventions described in the implementation \nfidelity literature (Table 18). Despite a lack of \nconcern about implementation fidelity within the \nHRM literature, there are similarities between the \nliterature described in Tables 18 and 20. Although \nthe HR studies sought to evaluate whether policy \nis being implemented rather than to do so while \nalso trying to achieve high levels of fidelity or \nevaluate its relationship with performance, the \nneed for support strategies is recognised: three \nstudies report how such strategies had been used by \norganisations.107,140,147 Like much implementation \nfidelity research, they focused entirely on \nadherence (including dose). The principal \ndifference between the two literatures concerns \ndata collection: the HR literature used only self-\nreport of participants rather than independent \nobservation \u2013 employee experience rather than the \nreport of quantitative data.\nIn many cases, studies compare details about \npolicy given by HR managers or documents, with \nthe report of employees. Disparities between \nthe two are highlighted. In most cases, greater \nweight is given to the report of the employees, \neven though self-report of employees can be \nan unreliable measure of a practice and its \nimplementation.110,143,148,149 No validity or reliability \ninformation was given about any measures. \nMeasures used were basic by comparison with \nthe fidelity scales, logs and checklists used in the \nfidelity literature (Table 21). HR studies reported \nlittle more than employees\u2019 opinions about whether \nor not a policy has been implemented; fidelity \nstudies often reported percentages or exact fidelity \nscores. Also, none of the HR studies sought to \nrelate fidelity to outcomes.\nResearch needs to test whether specificity of HRM \npolicy aids or hinders implementation fidelity \n(adherence and quality), and to ascertain if this \neffect varies according to context. This is a gap \nin the HR literature and implementation fidelity \nresearch. Research also fails to address adequately \nthe issue of local adaptation, which in HR is \nparticularly pronounced in multinationals and \nlarge public bodies where adaptations to local \ndemands and differing cultures is acknowledged as \nlegitimate, and may be incorporated in the policy \nor may be implicit in management\u2019s approach \nto it. The effect of specificity may in fact be \nmoderated by the extent to which local adaptation \nis allowed or more importantly vital for successful \nperformance.\nThe sophisticated knowledge of the concept and \nmeasurement of fidelity apparent in the specific \nimplementation fidelity research and associated \nliterature is clearly lacking in the field of policy \nimplementation research in HRM.\nImplementation\u2002fidelity\u2002in\u2002HRM\n62 TA\nB\nLE\n 2\n0 \nH\nRM\n s\ntu\ndi\nes\n m\nea\nsu\nrin\ng \nim\npl\nem\nen\nta\ntio\nn\nSt\nud\ny\nD\ne\nfi\nn\nit\nio\nn\n o\nf

This model is designed primarily for the \nevaluation of implementation fidelity in the area of \nHRM policy and practice, but applies equally to the \nevaluation of any intervention.\nThe framework begins with a written policy. \nMeasurement of implementation fidelity is basically \nmeasurement of adherence, i.e. has the policy \nbeen implemented fully in practice, as intended. \nThis requires that an evaluation assesses how far \nthe policy has been implemented as a practice, \npreferably by independent observation to reduce \nbias.138,150 The degree to which it is successfully \nimplemented may, in turn, be moderated, i.e. \ninfluenced, by the complexity of the practice\u2019s \ndescription, the adequacy of the strategies \nemployed (if any) to facilitate the implementation \nprocess, how well the policy is delivered in practice, \nand how receptive managers and employees are to \nthe new practice.\nAn example of this might be the introduction of \nteamworking: questions relating to adherence need \nto be asked: are people now performing a task as \na team rather than individuals; is the composition \nof the team as required (both \u2018content\u2019). Then, \nhowever, there may be an issue about whether the \npeople in the team are actually working in the \nway required, such as all team members being \ninvolved in decision-making (\u2018coverage\u2019, \u2018dose\u2019 \nand \u2018frequency\u2019). However, the level of adherence \nor implementation fidelity achieved may be \nmoderated by participants\u2019 understanding of their \nnew roles (determined by the quality of the training \ndelivered by those charged with explaining and \nimplementing the new practice, which, in turn, may \nbe affected by the complexity of the practice), and\/\nor whether their managers or they themselves are \ncommitted to the new way of working (participant \nresponsiveness). The degree of adherence or \nfidelity achieved may thus be influenced by all of \nthe potential moderators in the framework.\nAnother example might be training in a skill; for \n\u2018adherence\u2019 we would ask: Have all those been \ntrained who are eligible?; Did the training take \nPotential moderators:\n1.

However, implementation fidelity \nmight also require that the participants actually \nacquire knowledge of a new skill as a result of the \ntraining. Whether or not they did so might again \nbe influenced by the complexity of the training \nprogramme, the quality with which the training \nwas delivered (quality of delivery), the strategies \nthat were in place to support the delivery and \nimplementation of the training (such as a manual \nor guidelines), and whether the participants \nthemselves were actually receptive to the training \n(participant responsiveness).\nWhether the new knowledge acquired affects \noutcomes or performance is a separate question, \nbeyond fidelity. This is the remit of measures \nof the practice\u2013performance relationship. \nImplementation fidelity is therefore a potential \nmoderator of this relationship, as represented \nby the broken line in Figure 2. A sensitivity \nanalysis based on performance outcomes could \nthen determine which, if any, components or \ncombination of components are essential if the \npractice is to have its desired effect. The scope for \nadaptability would then be known, and the issue of \nexternal validity addressed more fully.\nFinally, the fidelity with which apparently less \ncomplex HRM practices are implemented may \nstill be affected by the moderators described here. \nFor example, appraisals: Have all those who are \neligible been covered? Are they appraised as often \nas they should be? Does the appraisal last the set \namount of time? Are the required elements of the \nprocess covered? The description of the process, \nthe support provided for its implementation, the \nquality of any training given to the managers \ndelivering the appraisals, their own delivery of the \nnew practice, and the enthusiasm of both managers \nand employees for the practice may all affect how \nfar the policy is adhered to in practice, i.e. the level \nof implementation fidelity achieved.\nThe framework in Figure 2 outlines and clarifies \nprocesses to be taken into account in any evaluation \nof implementation fidelity. This framework \ninforms the guidance presented at Appendix 4 and \nchecklist in Appendix 5. The guidance outlines \nthe questions that need to be asked at every stage \nin the process if high levels of implementation \nfidelity are to be achieved. The checklist is a tool to \nevaluate the fidelity with which policies have been \nimplemented. This evaluation could be undertaken \nby researchers, policy-makers or practitioners, \nindeed anyone seeking to assess whether a policy \nhad been implemented properly in practice, i.e. as \nintended by those designing and seeking to deliver \nthe policy.\nConclusion\nIntroduction of new practices, or the revision of \nexisting practices, requires formulation of policy or \nprogrammes. There is a growing interest in data \nfor assessing the quality of implementation.119,120,151 \nHowever, even if the requisite data are provided \nwithin examples of effective HRM interventions, \nit is still necessary to measure fidelity to \ngauge whether evidence-based policies are \nbeing implemented properly, in accordance \nwith a specific policy. Achievement of high \nimplementation fidelity is one way of replicating \nthe success achieved by original research. \nObviously, the successful development and \nimplementation of policy is governed by more than \nthe principles of evidence-based practice,152 but the \nabove framework helps to understand why and how \npolicy implementation should be evaluated.\nThis review concerns the entire HRM performance \nchain, from HR policy through to performance \noutcomes. This chain has several stages, from \npolicy to practice, from practices to intermediate \noutcomes, and from intermediate outcomes to \nfinal outcomes. The link between HRM practices \nand intermediate outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction, \nburnout), and the link between such intermediate \noutcomes and final outcomes (e.g. productivity\/\npatient care outcomes), are often measured by the \nresearch and are analysed in depth elsewhere in \nthis review. The HR policy to practice link, called \nhere implementation fidelity, is measured much \nless if at all. This section therefore considered \nthe first stage in the HR policy to performance \nchain, critically examined current literature on the \nconcept, outlined its importance, described how it \ncan be measured and the problems presented by \nmeasuring it. The relevance of this lies in how it \nhighlights the processes involved in implementing \npractices of demonstrable effectiveness and how \nthe implementation process may be evaluated. \nAs such, it is of value to policy-makers and those \nseeking to develop evidence-based practice.\n\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Specifically, it \ndiscusses current thinking about intermediate \noutcomes of HRM. First, the links between HRM \nand performance are considered. The chapter \nthen goes on to describe the method used for \nidentifying the intermediate outcomes considered \nin the review and provides conceptual definitions \nfor each intermediate outcome.\nIntermediate outcomes \nlinking HRM and \nperformance\nTwo of the principal aims of this review are to \nevaluate the research evidence linking HRM \npractices and organisational performance and \nalso the evidence for mechanisms or intermediate \noutcomes of HRM that may explain any link \nbetween HRM and performance; specifically, \nhow and why HRM practices may impact on \nperformance. While researchers have devoted a \ngreat deal of attention to examining the linkage \nbetween HRM practices and firm performance, \nthere has been less empirical work attempting to \nbetter understand possible causal mechanisms. \nWithout examining intervening variables or \nintermediate outcomes of HRM, it is difficult to \nrule out alternative explanations for an association \nbetween HRM and performance.23\nThere are a number of rationales and \nmodels explaining a link between HRM and \nperformance,13,22,153,154 and while there are \ndifferences there are also constant themes that \nare shared across the approaches. At a general \nlevel, most models are based on the assumption \nthat superior HRM practices are believed to result \nin more skilled, motivated, satisfied, committed, \nand hence productive, employees, who, in turn, \npromote a more effective firm.155 That is, employee \nskills, psychological states (such as attitudes and \nmotivation) and specific behaviours (such as job \nperformance and absenteeism) are purported to \nbe the mediating path between HRM and final \norganisational performance outcomes, although \nwe would expect HRM practices to also directly \ninfluence performance outcomes by creating \noperational and structural efficiencies. It is a short \nstep to specify the HRM practices that promote \nhigh knowledge, skills and abilities,22 for example \nthrough careful attention to recruitment, selection, \nappraisals and investment in training. Less \nstraightforward is the series of mental, emotional \nand attitudinal processes156 that are frequently \nproposed to link HRM and performance, \nand which are implied by labels such as high-\ncommitment and high-involvement HRM.\nIntermediate outcomes\nAlthough there are a multitude of variables \nthat are implicated in this process, some of the \nmore important proposed mental, emotional \nand attitudinal states are employee well-being, \nan effective psychological contract, perceived \norganisational support, fairness and justice, \nmotivation, job satisfaction, commitment job \ninvolvement and organisational climate.156 An \norganisation\u2019s HR architecture will be closely \ntied to these states. For example, satisfaction of \nemployees, perceptions of fairness and trusting \nmanagement\u2013employee relationships may be \ninfluenced by HR practices that provide employees \nwith opportunities for participation and autonomy. \nIntrinsic motivation could well be influenced by \nwork design interventions, such as job enrichment \nand empowerment. Firms offering job security \nand organisation pay programmes, such as profit-\nrelated pay, can engender employee perceptions\u2019 \nof organisational support, and their identification \nwith, and commitment to, the organisation.\nHowever, a lack of clarity remains about the degree \nof overlap between the constructs describing \nemployee states and their causal ordering (e.g. \nDoes satisfaction precede commitment, and \nunder what circumstances?; Is job satisfaction \na consequence of job involvement or is the \nrelationship reciprocal?). Also the relationships \nbetween any one individual\u2019s feelings, \nChapter 5  \nIdentifying linkages between HRM \npractices and performance outcomes\nIdentifying linkages between HRM practices and performance outcomes\n68\nattitudes, motives and performance will not be \nstraightforward.157 As Ostroff and Bowen155 point \nout, \u2018Lower performance is only one possible \nresponse to dissatisfaction. A dissatisfied employee \ncould file a grievance, engage in sabotage, ask for a \ntransfer, try to improve performance or fail to pass \non important information.158 In contrast, a satisfied \nemployee could work harder, engage in more \ncitizenship behaviours, improve skills or make \nsuggestions for improvements in work procedures\u2019 \n(p. 228). But although the relationship between \nsatisfaction and performance at the individual level \nmay be not be large, the collective effects for the \norganisation as a whole may be enhanced due to \nthe overall cumulative impact of the responses of \nsatisfied or dissatisfied employees.155\nProductivity-related employee \nbehaviours\nHow do employee mental, emotional and \nattitudinal states get converted into organisational \nperformance? The assumption is through their \ninfluence on employee behaviours salient to \neffective organisational performance, i.e. when \nthese mental, emotional and attitudinal states are \nfavourably directed then employees are more likely \nto display performance-orientated behaviours.156 \nThree pertinent sorts of employee behaviour are \ntask performance, withdrawal behaviours and \norganisational citizenship behaviour (OCB).154\nTask performance behaviours include job-related tasks \nand activities comprising the employee\u2019s formal \nrole.\nWithdrawal behaviours refer to absenteeism and \nturnover.\nOrganisational citizenship behaviours include \ncomponents of so-called prosocial behaviours, \nand refer to constructive or cooperative gestures \nthat are not mandatory, but which contribute \nto organisational effectiveness.159 OCB refers to \nwork-related behaviour that is outside traditional \ntask performance, in-role job performance and \nthe formal organisational reward system, but \nis beneficial to the organisation.160 Typically, \nemployees who engage in OCBs are those who \ngo the extra mile for their organisations and \ntherefore contribute to its effective functioning. \nThis discretionary work performance has been \nconceptualised in a number of ways (e.g. contextual \nperformance, prosocial organisational behaviour, \nextra role performance), but the research literature \nhas focused most prominently on OCB. The \nmost popular conceptualisation of OCB is a five-\ndimension model proposed by Organ,159 consisting \nof altruism, courtesy, conscientiousness, civic virtue \nand sportsmanship.\nAlthough much of the work on OCB takes the \nposition that there is a clear boundary between in-\nrole and extra-role behaviour, the distinction is not \nas clear as much of the literature suggests.161\nResearch has suggested that employees who are \nsatisfied with their jobs and committed to their \norganisation, and feel that they are treated fairly, \nare more likely to engage in OCBs.162 Consequently, \nOCBs have recently emerged as a potential \nimportant linking mechanism between employee \nattitudes, such as commitment and satisfaction, and \norganisational outcomes. Any single incidence of \ncitizenship may have a minor or moderate effect \u2013 \n\u2018however, across multiple acts of citizenship from a \nsingle employee, and across multiple employees, \nthe aggregate impact should be more substantial\u2019 \n(Ostroff and Bowen:155 227). However, so far, \narguments for an association between employee \nOCB and organisational performance are \nconceptual rather than empirical.\nIn summary, despite the paucity of evidence on \nthese relationships (evidence that will be reviewed \nin later chapters), it has been consistently theorised \nthat satisfaction, motivation and other mental, \nemotional and attitudinal states of employees \nare key factors in determining appropriate \nproductivity-related employee behaviour, \nwhich ultimately contribute to organisational \nperformance.\nA large number of variables may serve as \nintermediate outcomes linking HRM practices and \nfinal performance outcomes, from job satisfaction \nto organisational commitment, and from burnout \nto organisational support. Given the vast range of \npotential intermediate outcomes available from \nthe research, and the limitations of project time \nand resources, it was necessary to select a limited \nnumber of intermediate outcomes.\nSelecting intermediate \noutcomes\nIt is important to state at this stage that while we \nsupport the notion that HR practices have a direct \nimpact on the knowledge and skills of employees \nthat may translate to improved organisational \nperformance, here, and in line with the research \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

If two or more of the above sources cited an \nintermediate outcome then it was included.\nIn addition, intermediate outcomes that would be \notherwise excluded were included, nevertheless, if \nthey were present in a meta-analysis that reported \ncorrelations between this intermediate outcome \nand three or more selected intermediate outcomes \nidentified specifically to address Objectives 2 and 3 \n(see Chapter 9). For example, job involvement was \noriginally excluded as an intermediate outcome \nbecause it was only mentioned by one of the \nfour sources described above, but meta-analyses \nreported correlations between organisational \ncommitment, professional commitment, burnout \nand OCB and this variable. It was then included \nas an additional intermediate outcome of interest. \nFinally, a decision was made in consultation \nwith the expert panel to include three \u2018wildcard\u2019 \nvariables \u2013 employee engagement, organisational \nsupport and organisational climate. Engagement is \na newer concept in the literature but is increasingly \nseen as important employee orientation for \nperformance, and organisational climate and \norganisational support play a prominent role in \nsome models of HRM and performance.\nSelected intermediate outcomes\n\u2022\t Motivation.\n\u2022\t Job satisfaction.\n\u2022\t Organisational commitment.\n\u2022\t Occupational\/professional commitment.\n\u2022\t Engagement.\n\u2022\t Burnout.\n\u2022\t Job involvement.\n\u2022\t Turnover intentions.\n\u2022\t Psychological contract.\n\u2022\t Organisational justice (distributive, \nprocedural).\n\u2022\t Organisational support.\n\u2022\t Organisational climate.\nExcluded intermediate outcomes\nThe following potential intermediate outcomes \nwere in the initial list identified from the sources \nabove, but were excluded because they were only \ncited by a single source:\n\u2022\t work-related irritation\n\u2022\t job anxiety\/tension\n\u2022\t job exhaustion\n\u2022\t health complaints\n\u2022\t psychosomatic complaints\n\u2022\t psychophysiological stress reactions\n\u2022\t somatic complaints\n\u2022\t physical symptoms\n\u2022\t psychological well-being\n\u2022\t depression\n\u2022\t strain (depression \/anxiety)\n\u2022\t occupational stress\n\u2022\t frustration\n\u2022\t life distress\n\u2022\t life satisfaction\n\u2022\t self-esteem\n\u2022\t conscientiousness\n\u2022\t level of participation\n\u2022\t transfer of learning\n\u2022\t overflow.\nDefinitions of selected \nintermediate outcomes\nMotivation\nWork motivation can be generally defined as \nthe direction, intensity and persistence of work \nbehaviour;168 i.e. what drives a person\u2019s choice \nIdentifying linkages between HRM practices and performance outcomes\n70\nof what to do, how hard they try and how long \nthey keep trying. Motivation is clearly critical to \nperformance. Indeed, work performance is often \nused as a measure of a person\u2019s motivation,169 \nalthough there are many other factors that \ninfluence performance other than motivation (e.g. \nability, resources, employee collaboration and \ncooperation). There are many motivation theories \nthat have been advanced to help understand \nbehaviour at work but it is often difficult to know \nwhich theory is helpful in any individual case.169 \nSome theories are more relevant to the notion that \nHRM practices effect employee motivation, such \nas goal-setting theory, equity theory and job design \ntheory.\nJob satisfaction\nJob satisfaction is the most widely researched \nconcept in organisational psychology and \norganisational behaviour. Locke170 estimated \nthat over 3300 studies on job satisfaction had \nbeen conducted up to 1973. Judge et al.171 then \nidentified a further 7856 studies on job satisfaction \nsince 1973 using the PsycINFO database. Studies \nand papers have been written about its definition, \nmeaning, specific dimensions of job satisfaction, its \nantecedents and its consequences. Its popularity \nstems from the key role it plays in many theories \nand models of organisational practices and \nprocesses, individual attitudes and behaviours. \nJob satisfaction is important as an end in itself \nfor employees and also because of proposed \nrelationships with individual and organisational \neffectiveness (e.g. turnover and performance). It \nis a widely held belief that \u2018a happy worker is a \nproductive worker\u2019 (although there is considerable \ndebate about the validity of this statement), and job \nsatisfaction is one way of measuring happiness at \nwork.\nLocke170 defined job satisfaction as \u2018a pleasurable \nor positive emotional state resulting from the \nappraisal of one\u2019s job or job experiences\u2019. Thus \njob satisfaction involves affective (emotional) states \nor how one feels about one\u2019s job, and cognition, \nderiving from appraisal of the situation. Although \nthere is some debate about the emphasis placed \non affect and cognition, it is probably most helpful \nto think of job satisfaction as the interplay of \ncognition and affect, or thoughts and feelings.171\nJob satisfaction can be thought of as an overall \nassessment of one\u2019s job but which comprises various \njob facets, such as satisfaction with pay, recognition, \npromotion, co-workers, supervision and the work \nitself. In addition, the concept is sometimes \nseparated into intrinsic satisfaction, which involves \nsatisfaction with supervision, co-workers and the \nwork itself, and extrinsic satisfaction that targets \nfeatures extrinsic to task activities, such as pay and \npromotion.\nOrganisational commitment\nEmployee commitment to an organisation has been \ndefined in a variety of ways but is most popularly \noperationalised as the level of attachment and \nloyalty to an organisation among its employees.172 \nThe concept has been particularly popular in the \nHRM literature as many scholars advocate that \nthe traditional relationship between employer and \nemployee, based on control, must be replaced by a \nhigh-commitment approach.1\nMowday et al.173 who were influential in the early \nwork on commitment, characterised it as a strong \nbelief in and acceptance of the organisation\u2019s goals \nand values, a willingness to exert considerable \neffort on behalf of the organisation, and a strong \ndesire to maintain membership in an organisation. \nThey have developed a widely used scale, the \nOrganisational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ), \nto measure these elements. But the definition and \nthe measure have been criticised for conflating \ncommitment with outcomes such as effort and \npropensity to stay.\nMeyer and Allen174 have suggested definitions and \nmeasures based on three broad themes. Affective \ncommitment describes an employee\u2019s liking for an \norganisation and emphasised identification and \ninvolvement in the organisation. Employees with a \nstrong affective commitment continue employment \nwith the organisation because they want to do so.175 \nContinuance commitment refers to an awareness of \nthe costs associated with leaving the organisation. \nEmployees whose primary link to the organisation \nis based on continuance commitment remain with \nthe employer because they need to do so. Finally, \nnormative commitment reflects a feeling of obligation \nto continue employment. Employees with a high \nlevel of normative commitment feel that they ought \nto remain with the organisation.\nThe HRM literature has, not surprisingly, \nconcentrated on the affective aspect of \ncommitment because of the assumed associated \npositive organisational gains. The general theory \nof organisational commitment predicts that high \ncommitment should result in greater motivation \nand performance, lower absenteeism and lower \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n71\nlabour turnover,172 with consequent organisational \nbenefits.\nOccupational\/professional \ncommitment\nMuch of the theoretical and empirical work on \ncommitment has focused on the organisation; \nhowever, it is clear that workers have multiple \ncommitments at work (such as work itself) and the \norganisational unit (such as the team, department \nor branch). An important commitment domain \noutside the employing organisation is commitment \nto the profession or occupation as well as the \nfamily.\nAs with organisational commitment it is the state \nof psychological attachment that is important \nin the occupational commitment literature.176 \nOccupational commitment is the individual\u2019s \npsychological attachment to, and identification \nwith, his\/her occupation, based on an affective \nreaction to that occupation.177\nThe strength of employees\u2019 occupational \ncommitment may have important consequences \nfor organisations because of its potential links to \nretention and work performance. Also, the salience \nof occupational commitment may be on the rise as \na means of coping with the uncertainty of extensive \norganisational change.178 Workers may increase \ntheir identification with their occupation on the \nbasis that they retain more control over that aspect \nof their working life.\nAlthough there has been debate over the \npossible inherent conflict between occupational \ncommitment and organisational commitment, \nmore recent work argues that the two forms of \ncommitment are not incompatible, but rather they \nare positively associated.177\nWork engagement\nWork engagement refers to \u2018a positive, fulfilling, \nwork-related state of mind characterized by \nvigour, dedication and absorption\u2019.179 Vigour is \ncharacterised by high levels of energy and mental \nresilience while working, a desire to invest effort in \none\u2019s work and persistence in the face of adversity. \nDedication refers to a strong psychological \ninvolvement in one\u2019s work, together with feelings \nof pride, significance, enthusiasm and inspiration. \nFinally, absorption refers to total concentration on, \nand pleasant immersion in, work.\nAlthough the concept is relatively new, work \nengagement does overlap with established concepts \nalso included in this review as intermediate \noutcomes. Vigour is conceptually similar to \nmotivation, and the dimension of dedication shares \nconceptual space with those of job involvement \nand commitment.180 Engagement has been \ndefined as the opposite of burnout,181 as, contrary \nto employees suffering from burnout, engaged \nemployees are energetically and effectively \nconnected to their work, and able to cope well with \nthe demands of the job.182\nEngagement is influenced by the availability \nof job resources that reduce job demands, help \nachieve work goals and stimulate learning and \ndevelopment.183 Examples of possible resources are \ntraining and coaching, performance feedback and \nparticipative management.\nBurnout\nBurnout is defined as \u2018a persistent, negative, work-\nrelated state in normal individuals that is primarily \ncharacterised by exhaustion, which is accompanied \nby distress, a sense of reduced effectiveness, \ndecreased motivation and the development of \ndysfunctional attitudes and behaviours at work\u2019.184 \nIt is a psychological strain resulting from chronic \nwork stress, such as job demands.\nThe concept of burnout was initially associated \nwith human services work such as health care \nand social work, where employees are engaged in \n\u2018people\u2019 work, for example, providing patient care. \nIt is usually characterised as a three-dimensional \nsyndrome. Le Blanc et al.185 describe the \ndimensions in relation to burnout in nursing staff \nin three stages:\n\u2022\t First, high emotional demands in interpersonal \nrelationships with patients lead workers to feel \nemotionally exhausted.\n\u2022\t Second, as a coping strategy they may try \nto protect themselves by detaching from \ntheir patients by treating their patients in \nan indifferent and cynical way.186,187 This \ndetached attitude towards patients is called \ndepersonalisation.\n\u2022\t Finally, as a result of this dysfunctional attitude, \nworkers are unable to perform adequately, and \nthe quality of their care is impaired. In turn, \nthis may lead to a decline in their feelings \nof personal accomplishment or professional \nefficacy.\nIdentifying linkages between HRM practices and performance outcomes\n72\nMore recent research has argued that burnout \nexists outside the realm of human services. \nConsequently, the concept has been adapted \nto apply to all employees, by replacing the \ndepersonalisation dimension with cynicism, which \nreflects indifference towards work in general, not \nnecessarily towards other people.188\nBurnout may have negative consequences not just \nfor the individual (such as health problems), but \nalso in relation to organisational outcomes such as \nabsenteeism and performance.\nJob involvement\nThe concept of job involvement has been the \nsubject of a large volume of research for over \n40 years. Although it is subject to some definitional \nconfusion, Brown189 notes that most research \nhas followed Lawler and Hall\u2019s190 definition of \njob involvement as \u2018psychological identification \nwith one\u2019s work\u2019 and \u2018the degree to which the job \nsituation is central to the person and his [or her] \nidentity\u2019. The more recent concept of employee \nengagement treads on similar territory.\nMultiple outcomes are often attributed to high \njob involvement. Job involvement has been \nconsidered important for promoting employee \nmotivation,191 goal-directed behaviour, personal \ngrowth and satisfaction, and consequently \nperformance.190,192,193 For example, Janssen194 \ndescribes it as \u2018the key that unlocks motivation\u2019 \nto exert extra effort. Increasing job involvement \nhas been advocated as a means to \u2018enhance \norganisational effectiveness and productivity by \nengaging employees more completely in their \nwork and making work a more meaningful and \nfulfilling experience\u2019.189 Developing enriched jobs \nis regarded as an important means for stimulating \njob involvement.192,195\nTurnover intentions\nMorrell et al.196 describe turnover as \u2018voluntary \ncessation of membership of an organisation by an \nemployee of that organisation\u2019. Turnover intention \nor intention to quit is the psychological state that \nprecedes this cessation.\nPsychological contract\nThe relationship between employees and \nemployers is central to HRM. The concept of the \npsychological contract explores this relationship \nby describing the mutual obligations or exchange \nrelationship perceived by the employee to bind him \nor her with the organisation.197 The individual\u2019s \npsychological contract reflects his of her \nunderstanding of each party\u2019s obligations, derived \nin part from HRM practices, and also verbal \nstatements and actions each party has made.\nPsychological contracts have important implications \nfor employee attitudes and behaviours, especially \nwhen employees perceive that obligations \nor promises explicitly or implicitly made by \nan employer have been unfulfilled. Contract \nperceptions are associated with attitudes such as \nmistrust, employee behaviour (including effort and \ncontribution), frequency of absence, and intention \nto stay or leave.198\nOrganisational justice\nOrganisational justice is one of the most popular \nresearch topics in HRM, organisational psychology \nand organisational behaviour.199 The literature \nhas \u2018grown around attempts to describe and \nexplain the role of fairness as a consideration in \nthe workplace\u2019,200 and much of the research in \nthis area starts from the premise that employees\u2019 \njudgements of fairness are important in \ndetermining organisational outcomes such as job \nsatisfaction, organisational commitment, intention \nto quit and OCB.201 What is just or unjust is based \non individuals\u2019 perceptions of fairness.\nOrganisational justice research has primarily been \nconcerned with distributive justice and procedural \njustice. Distributive justice deals with perceived \nfairness of the distribution of outcomes, such as \npay and promotion decisions, whereas procedural \njustice focuses on the fairness of the process by \nwhich outcomes are determined.202 The process for \nmaking organisational decisions may be equally or \nmore important to employees as their perception \nof outcome fairness.\nInteractional justice,203 as more recently advanced \nin the justice literature, relates to the quality of \nthe interpersonal treatment people receive when \nprocedures are implemented, and can be seen as \ntaking two forms.204,205 First, interpersonal justice, \nwhich pertains to the degree to individuals feel \nthey are treated with respect, politeness and \nhonesty in the process. The second, informational \njustice, reflects employees\u2019 perceptions about \nwhether they feel that they are provided with \nadequate explanations for the use of procedures or \nfor outcome distribution.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n73\nOrganisational support\nPerceived organisational support refers to \nemployees\u2019 global beliefs concerning the extent to \nwhich the organisation values their contributions \nand cares about their well-being.206,207 Employees \nview their favourable or unfavourable treatment \nas in indication that the organisation favours \nor disfavours them. Perceived favourable \ntreatment can be around issues such as fairness, \norganisational rewards and favourable job \nconditions (e.g. pay, promotions, participation). \nFavourable treatment contributes more towards \nperceived organisational support if the employee \nbelieves that they result from the organisation\u2019s \nvoluntary actions, as opposed to external pressures \nsuch as government regulations.206,207\nEmployees who perceive themselves to be \nsupported and valued are more likely to respond \nin a favourable manner. Organisational support \ntheory proposes three psychological mechanisms \nunderpinning the consequences of support.208 \nFirst, on the basis of reciprocity, organisational \nsupport should produce an obligation in employees \nto care about the organisation\u2019s welfare and goal \nattainment. Second, the support and respect \nprovided by the organisation should satisfy \nsocioemotional needs, leading to employees \npsychologically identifying with the organisation. \nThird, perceived organisational support should \nincrease employees\u2019 beliefs that the organisation \nrecognises increased performance. These processes \nshould result in positive attitudes (e.g. commitment \nand satisfaction) and behaviours (e.g. reduced \nturnover, increased performance).\nPerceived organisational support has been found \nto be related to, but distinct from, organisational \ncommitment, procedural justice and job \nsatisfaction.208\nOrganisational climate\nCentral to most, if not all, models of organisational \nbehaviour are employee perceptions of the work \nenvironment, referred to generally as organisational \nclimate.209 Primarily understood as an intervening \nvariable between the context of an organisation \nand the behaviour of its members, and attempting \nto understand how employees experience their \norganisations, the concept has inspired many \ndescriptions and operationalisations. The \ndominant approach conceptualises climate as \nemployees\u2019 perceptions of what their organisation \nis like in terms of its routines, practices, procedures \nand rewards.210\nAn initial assumption of theory and research in \nthis area was that social environments could be \ncharacterised by a limited number of dimensions. \nTypical dimensions were role stress and lack of \nharmony; job challenge and autonomy; reward \norientation; leadership facilitation and support; \nwork group cooperation, friendliness and \nwarmth.211,212 However, over the years the number \nof climate dimensions identified as targets of \nassessment has proliferated to cover numerous \ndimensions of organisational life. Confusingly, \nsome of the dimensions that are frequently used in \nclimate research overlap or match other constructs \nconsidered in this review, such as perceived \norganisational support, and work design variables, \nsuch as autonomy and role conflict.\nAn important distinction has been made between \npsychological climate and organisational \nclimate.213 Psychological climate is based on \nindividuals\u2019 perceptions of the organisation, but \nwhen individuals in the same unit (e.g. team, \ndepartment) or organisation agree or share their \nperceptions, organisational climate emerges, \nrepresented by the mean score across all employees \nwithin a particular unit or organisation. The \nrationale behind aggregating individual data to \na unit level is the assumption that organisational \ncollectives have their own distinct climate.\nCulture and climate are similar concepts since \nboth describe employees\u2019 experiences of their \norganisations. Organisational climate, according \nto Schneider,214 represents the descriptions \nof the things that happen to employees in an \norganisation, they tell us what is happening, \nwhereas culture comes to light when employees \nare asked why these patterns exist. The question \nis answered in relation to shared values, common \nassumptions, and patterns of beliefs held by \norganisational members and it is these which \ndefine organisational culture.\nSchneider214\u2013216 eschews the use of general \nmultidimensional measures of climate and argues \nfor a facet-specific climate approach where \nclimate has a focus and is tied to something of \ninterest. Schneider suggests that the dimensions \nof organisational climate will differ depending on \nthe purpose of the investigation and that general \nmeasures of organisational climate will contain \ndimensions that are not relevant for each specific \nstudy. This line of argument has encouraged the \ndevelopment of measures with a particular strategic \nfocus such as service217 and safety,218 which are \nIdentifying linkages between HRM practices and performance outcomes\n74\npredictive of relevant outcomes (e.g. customer \nservice, safe behaviours).\nResearch has suggested that climate perceptions \nare associated with a variety of important outcomes \nat the individual, group and organisational \nlevels. These include leader behaviour,209,219 \nabsenteeism and turnover,220 job satisfaction,221\u2013223 \ncommitment,224 individual job performance,225,226 \nand organisational performance.36\nFor the purposes of this review, the focus was \ninitially on general multidimensional measures and \nperformance outcomes. However, very little was \nfound in this area so the criteria were expanded to \ninclude facet-specific measures.\nWithin HRM and performance models, climate is \noften conceived as a linking mechanism between \nthe HR system and collective employee thoughts, \nemotions and attitudes.154 That is, the HR system \ninfluences climate, which shapes employee \nstates, such as satisfaction and motivation, \nand subsequently employee behaviours and \nperformance.\nDistinguishing final outcomes \nand intermediate outcomes\nVarious organisational stakeholders may consider \norganisational effectiveness quite differently. For \nexample, employees may well consider some of \nthe intermediate outcomes identified above, such \nas job satisfaction, to be their goal, rather than \norganisational performance. This has led to the \nuse of the \u2018balanced scorecard\u2019 approach227 to \nreflect the objectives of all major stakeholders \n(e.g. shareholders, managers, customers and \nemployees). However, the brief for this review \nclearly focuses on organisational performance as \nthe final outcomes in a framework linking HRM \nand performance. In the health sector we have \ndefined the final outcomes, in accordance with \nthe review brief, as patient outcomes. Outside the \nhealth sector, we view final performance outcomes \nas financial outcomes (e.g. profits, sales revenue, \nmarket share) and organisational outcomes (e.g. \ncustomer satisfaction, output measures such as \nproductivity). This approach has determined the \nremainder of this report.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The findings \npresented in Chapter 6 focus exclusively on \nevidence from the health sector and examine the \nextent to which HRM practices have an impact on \nintermediate outcomes. Specifically, it addresses:\n\u2022\t Objective 5: 5.1 What is the evidence for the \nimpact of HRM practices on the intermediate \noutcomes identified for this review?\nThis chapter provides a narrative summary for \nrelevant longitudinal research relating specifically \nto the health sector and health professionals. This \nsynthesis also enables a comparison of this research \nand its findings with that of the non-health sector.\nThis chapter first summarises the specific method \nfor this part of the review then gives an overview of \nthe intermediate outcomes for which evidence was \nfound. Finally, narrative syntheses and data tables \nare presented for each intermediate outcome.\nReview methodology\nThe broad approach to systematic review \nmethodology adopted to identify the evidence \npresented in Chapters 6\u20138 is described in Chapter \n2. This section describes aspects of the review \nmethodology specific to this search.\nStudies in this section are a drawn from two \nsystematic reviews of longitudinal studies:\n\u2022\t The first, a broad review of HRM practices and \nintermediate and\/or final outcomes (reported \nfully in Chapter 8), used a simple protocol to \nidentify relevant papers. The population for \nthe searches was identified as working adults \nand the intervention was determined as any \nHRM or personnel management practice. No \ncomparison was specified, but a longitudinal \nfilter was developed and used in the search. No \nspecific outcomes were stipulated.\n\u2022\t The second, a more specific search for HRM \nand patient outcomes (reported fully in \nChapter 7) used a more focused search strategy \nin which the population was working adults, \nthe intervention was fixed as one of the broad \ncategories of HRM practice (see Chapter 3 for \ndetails) and the outcomes identified as a range \nof patient outcomes (again, described fully in \nChapter 7).\nIn both searches there was no exclusion of studies \nbased on formal quality assessment. However, \nlongitudinal study design was a criterion for \ninclusion in the review and served as a form of \nquality assessment. This ensured that the search \nwas focused on causal relationships.\nThe search strategies and methodology used for \nidentifying longitudinal studies in Chapters 7 and \n8 therefore apply here also; only the inclusion \ncriteria are different. To be included in this part \nof the review, studies had to satisfy the following \ncriteria.\nInclusion criteria\n\u2022\t Longitudinal study design.\n\u2022\t HRM practice (e.g. work design, training, \nappraisal).\n\u2022\t One of the intermediate outcomes identified \nin Chapter 5 (e.g. job satisfaction, burnout, \norganisational commitment).\n\u2022\t The intermediate outcome must apply to \nhealth professionals.\n\u2022\t The study must test the causal relationship \nbetween the practice and the intermediate \noutcome.\nExclusion criteria\n\u2022\t Unpublished dissertations.\nChapter 6  \nThe impact of HRM practices on intermediate \noutcomes among health professionals\nThe impact of HRM practices on health professionals\n76\nResults\nSummary of evidence\nReferences identified by the search were scanned by \ntwo reviewers for studies that satisfied the inclusion \ncriteria. Intermediate outcomes are categorised \nwith the corresponding numbers of studies as \nshown in Table 22, below.\nJob satisfaction\nAll of these studies consider the impact of HRM \ninterventions or practices on job satisfaction \namong health professionals. A narrative synthesis \nis preferred here despite the homogeneity of some \nclusters of studies in this sample. No systematic \nreviews of this relationship in the health sector \nhave been found.\nDetails of studies\nTen studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 23). \nAll were published in English between 1982 and \n2002. Five studies were conducted in the USA, two \nin the UK, and one each in Denmark, Sweden and \nthe Netherlands. Two studies had experimental \ndesigns,228,229 but the remainder were all \nprospective in design. Studies varied in duration, \nfrom 13 weeks to 5 years, and sample sizes ranged \nfrom 24 staff to over 2000.\nHRM practice\nNine of the 10 studies examined work design or a \nfacet of work design. Four studies considered re-\nallocation of work in some form, such as changing \nwho performed certain functions or how a certain \ntask was performed.228,230\u2013232 Five studies examined \nthe impact of job characteristics on various \noutcomes. Job characteristics were evaluated in \nseveral different ways. Two studies considered \nthem from the perspective of job demand and \ncontrol,229,233 two from the perspective of role \nconflict or ambiguity,234,235 and one considered task \ncomplexity.236 Two of these studies also considered \nthe impact of pay on job satisfaction234,236 and \none evaluated the causal relationship between \nemployee participation in decision-making and \njob satisfaction.235 Finally, one study evaluated the \nimpact of the implementation of a new care policy \n\u2013 work reorganisation generally, rather than a \nspecific element of work design.237\nOutcomes\nMost studies measured a range of outcomes in \naddition to job satisfaction, including burnout, \norganisational commitment, collaboration, costs, \nclimate, and patient care outcomes, such as length \nof stay and patient satisfaction. Only two studies \nmeasured job satisfaction alone.234,236 Each study \nin this set of 10 used a different instrument to \nmeasure job satisfaction, ranging from specific job \nsatisfaction scales such as Sandman\u2019s238 Job Stress \nIndex, to broader work psychology measures, \nfor example the Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS)195 \nor health scales, such as the General Health \nQuestionnaire (GHQ).239 Two studies developed \ntheir own instrument.\nResults\nAll four of the work re-engineering and task \nreallocation studies found some form of positive \noutcome for job satisfaction. The move to greater \nteam working\/collaboration in two of these \nstudies had a positive effect on job satisfaction, \nand significant improvement was found for all \nbut two of the additional outcomes measured by \nthese studies also.230,231 In the third such study, the \nperformance of tasks in certain settings (surgical \nand male wards) was found to be associated with \nimproved satisfaction,228 and the reorganisation of \nwork, involving an increase in workload, was found \nnot to have an adverse effect on satisfaction by the \nfourth study.232\nThe sample of studies evaluating the relationship \nbetween job characteristics and job satisfaction \nfound more inconsistent results. In terms of \njob demands and control, one study found that \nlevels of demand or control had no effect on job \nsatisfaction,229 whereas the second found that social \nTABLE 22 Number of studies satisfying inclusion criteria\nIntermediate outcomes\nNo. of studies satisfying \ninclusion criteria\nMotivation 0\nJob satisfaction 10\nBurnout 3\nJob involvement 0\nOccupational commitment 0\nTurnover intentions 1\nOrganisational commitment 1\nEngagement 0\nOrganisational justice 0\nOrganisational climate 1\nPsychological contract 0\nPerceived organisational \nsupport\n0\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Role conflict or ambiguity was also \nfound to have no effect on job satisfaction,234,235 \nalthough task complexity did demonstrate \na significant association: complex tasks were \nassociated with high job satisfaction, routine tasks \nwith low job satisfaction.236\nStudies of payment practices found different \nresults. Blau236 found that high wages increased \njob satisfaction, but Agho et al.234 found no causal \nrelationship between salary and this outcome. \nBoth studies used the same study design. Also, \nBateman and Strasser235 found that participation in \ndecision-making did not impact on job satisfaction. \nFinally, the introduction of a new care policy had a \nsignificant negative effect on job satisfaction.\nOmissions\nThese studies only focused on the HRM practices \nof pay, employee involvement and work design, \nespecially job characteristics. Longitudinal studies \nof the impact of other HRM practices on health \nprofessionals\u2019 job satisfaction were not identified by \nthis review.\nSummary\nThere is little consistency in the findings of this \ngroup of studies. Most studies examined either \nsome aspect of work design or pay, and its impact \non job satisfaction, but only reallocation of roles \nor tasks consistently demonstrated a positive effect \non job satisfaction, and role conflict consistently \nshowed no effect at all. In both cases, results were \nfound across two studies only. The remaining \nstudies found some positive effects, some absence \nof effect, and, in one case, the intervention \nproduced a negative effect. However, there are \nsubstantial gaps in the literature and the potential \nrelationship between many practices and job \nsatisfaction in the health sector has not been tested \nby longitudinal research.\nBurnout and morale\nAll studies consider the impact of HRM \ninterventions or practices on burnout and morale \namong health professionals. No systematic reviews \nof this relationship in the health sector have been \nfound.\nDetails of studies\nThree studies met the inclusion criteria237,248,249 \n(Table 24). All studies were published in English, \nwith the earliest dating from 1999. Each study \nwas conducted in a different country: the UK, \nAustralia and Sweden. Two studies were of the same \nduration, i.e. 3 years; the other was 15 months. \nThe sample design was between 200 and 900 \nhealth-care staff; in one case the sample size was \nnot given.\nHRM practice\nTwo studies examined either team working248 \nor new forms of team working as part of the \nintervention:249 the former affected nurses only and \nthe latter all staff. The third study examined a very \ndifferent type of work reorganisation intervention: \nthe introduction of a new patient care policy.237\nOutcomes\nTwo of these studies examined morale, an inverse \nmeasure of burnout,248,249 and both measured this \nby evaluating sickness absence rates and turnover. \nThese studies also measured several patient and \nperformance outcomes. The third study evaluated \nburnout using the Pines et al.250 measure of this \ndimension of psychological well-being.237\nResults\nThe two team-working studies both found that the \nintroduction of team working had a positive effect \non staff morale.248,249 In fact, a positive effect was \nfound on almost all outcomes measured by these \ntwo studies. The two studies used different, but \nrelatively strong (experimental and prospective \ncohort) study designs. The third study also used \na prospective cohort design but found that the \nHRM practice \u2013 the introduction of a new policy \u2013 \nincreased burnout and thus had a negative effect.237\nOmissions\nThese studies only focused on the impact of a \nsingle element of work design on morale and \nburnout. The effect of no other type of practice \nwas found in this review of the longitudinal HRM \nliterature.\nSummary\nTwo of the three studies found were quite \nhomogeneous in terms of their intervention and \noutcome, and found very similar results: team \nworking can improve morale. The third study was \nquite different in terms of both the intervention \nand outcome, and found that the introduction of \na particular care policy had a significant negative \neffect in terms of increased burnout.\nThe impact of HRM practices on health professionals\n78 TA\nB\nLE\n 2\n3 \nJo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, \ndu\nra\nti\non\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n)\nFi\nde\nlit\ny \nm\nea\nsu\nre\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nJo\nne\ns \net\n a\nl. \n(1\n99\n7)\n23\n0\nU\nSA\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nhi\nst\nor\nic\nal\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\n11\n9 \nst\naf\nf\nPa\ntie\nnt\n n\num\nbe\nrs\n \nun\nkn\now\nn\n15\n m\non\nth\ns\nRe\n-e\nng\nin\nee\nre\nd \nw\nor\nk \nde\nsi\ngn\n fo\nr \npa\ntie\nnt\n \nfo\ncu\nse\nd \nca\nre\n; u\nse\n \nof\n m\nul\ntid\nis\nci\npl\nin\nar\ny \nco\nlla\nbo\nra\ntio\nn\nN\no\nEm\npl\noy\nee\n s\nat\nis\nfa\nct\nio\nn;\n \npa\ntie\nnt\n s\nat\nis\nfa\nct\nio\nn;\n \nco\nlla\nbo\nra\ntio\nn;\n c\nos\nt \nof\n c\nar\ne;\n \nle\nng\nth\n o\nf s\nta\ny\nA\ntt\nitu\nde\n s\nur\nve\ny \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne \nfo\nr \nhe\nal\nth\n \nca\nre\n (1\n98\n5)\n24\n0\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nEm\npl\noy\nee\n s\nat\nis\nfa\nct\nio\nn,\n \npa\ntie\nnt\n s\nat\nis\nfa\nct\nio\nn,\n le\nng\nth\n o\nf s\nta\ny\nN\neg\nat\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nC\nol\nla\nbo\nra\ntio\nn \nde\ncr\nea\nse\nd\nN\no \nef\nfe\nct\n: C\nos\nts\nO\n\u2019C\non\nno\nr \n(1\n99\n3)\n23\n1\nU\nK\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nhi\nst\nor\nic\nal\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\n38\n p\nat\nie\nnt\ns\n10\n s\nta\nff:\n a\nct\niv\nit\ny\n24\n s\nta\nff:\n s\nat\nis\nfa\nct\nio\nn\n6 \nm\non\nth\ns\nD\nai\nly\n p\nat\nie\nnt\n a\nllo\nca\ntio\nn \n(o\nld\n s\nys\nte\nm\n) \nvs\n t\nea\nm\n \nnu\nrs\nin\ng \n(c\non\ntin\nui\nty\n o\nf \nca\nre\n) \n(n\new\n s\nys\nte\nm\n)\nN\no\nJo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn;\n a\nct\niv\nit\ny \nan\nal\nys\nis\n; Q\nIC\nC\nJo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn:\n 2\n0-\nite\nm\n \nsc\nal\ne \n(o\nw\nn \nsc\nal\ne)\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nA\nll\nPa\nrk\nes\n \n(1\n98\n2)\n22\n8\nU\nK\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nco\nnc\nur\nre\nnt\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\n16\n4 \nst\nud\nen\nt \nnu\nrs\nes\n13\n w\nee\nks\nPr\nac\ntic\nes\nM\ned\nic\nal\n v\ns \nsu\nrg\nic\nal\n w\nar\nd \ndu\nty\nM\nal\ne \nvs\n fe\nm\nal\ne \nw\nar\nd \ndu\nty\nN\no\nW\nor\nk \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn;\n w\nor\nk \npe\nrf\nor\nm\nan\nce\n; a\nffe\nct\niv\ne \nst\nat\nes\n; s\nom\nat\nic\n s\nym\npt\nom\ns;\n \nso\nci\nal\n d\nys\nfu\nnc\ntio\nns\n; \nde\npr\nes\nsi\non\n; a\nnx\nie\nty\n; \nsi\nck\nne\nss\n\/a\nbs\nen\nce\nA\nffe\nct\niv\ne \nst\nat\nes\n: G\nH\nQ\n, \nG\nol\ndb\ner\ng \n(1\n97\n8)\n23\n9\nSu\nrg\nic\nal\n w\nar\nds\n w\ner\ne \nhi\ngh\ner\n in\n \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn \nth\nan\n m\ned\nic\nal\n w\nar\nds\n, a\nnd\n \nm\nal\ne \nw\nar\nds\n w\ner\ne \nhi\ngh\ner\n t\nha\nn \nfe\nm\nal\ne \nw\nar\nds\nO\nth\ner\n o\nut\nco\nm\nes\n m\nix\ned\nJu\nng\n e\nt a\nl. \n(1\n99\n4)\n23\n2\nU\nSA\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nhi\nst\nor\nic\nal\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\n26\n5 \nnu\nrs\nes\n21\n m\non\nth\ns\nW\nor\nkl\noa\nd \nre\ndi\nst\nri\nbu\ntio\nn \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne:\n d\nec\nre\nas\ne \nnu\nrs\ne \nw\nor\nkl\noa\nd,\n \nin\ncr\nea\nse\n u\nse\n a\nnd\n \npr\nod\nuc\ntiv\nit\ny \nof\n n\nur\nsi\nng\n \nas\nsi\nst\nan\nts\n, e\ndu\nca\nte\n \nnu\nrs\nes\n t\no \ndi\nre\nct\n a\nnd\n \nsu\npe\nrv\nis\ne \nan\nci\nlla\nry\n s\nta\nff\nN\no\nJo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn;\n n\nur\nse\ns \nab\nili\nty\n t\no \nsu\npe\nrv\nis\ne \nnu\nrs\nin\ng \nas\nsi\nst\nan\nts\n, c\noo\nrd\nin\nat\nio\nn \nof\n c\nar\ne;\n q\nua\nlit\ny \nof\n n\nur\nsi\nng\n \nca\nre\n; w\nor\nkl\noa\nd;\n p\nat\nie\nnt\n \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn\nJo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn:\n P\nri\nce\n a\nnd\n \nM\nue\nlle\nr \n(1\n98\n6)\n24\n1\nN\no \nef\nfe\nct\n: W\nor\nk \nde\nle\nga\nte\nd \nin\ncr\nea\nse\nd \nw\nit\nh \nno\n s\nig\nni\nfic\nan\nt \nef\nfe\nct\n o\nn \nou\ntc\nom\nes\nN\nie\nls\nen\n e\nt \nal\n.

No systematic reviews of this relationship in \nthe health sector have been found.\nDetails of studies\nOnly one study met the inclusion criteria \n(Table 25),252 published in English and conducted \nin Israel. It used a prospective longitudinal design \nover 12 months. The sample consisted of 146 \nhealth professionals.\nHRM practice\nThe study examined the effect of job scope (job \nvariety) on intention to leave among health \nprofessionals in an Israeli hospital.\nOutcomes\nIt examined health professionals\u2019 intentions to \nleave, and used its own scale to measure this staff \nattitude.\nResults\nThe study found that greater scope for variation \nwithin the job made it less likely that the health \nprofessionals would seek to leave their current \nposition.\nOmissions\nThis study focused on a very specific facet of work \ndesign. No longitudinal research was identified that \nexamined the impact of any other HRM practices, \nsuch as training, pay, performance management or \nselection, on an individual\u2019s intention to leave.\nSummary\nOne study has found that the job characteristic of \nhaving scope for variation within a job is positive \nin relation to turnover intentions among health \nprofessionals, i.e. such personnel were less likely \nto leave if there was good scope for variety within \ntheir work. However, this was a finding of only a \nsingle, small-scale study. No other dimensions of \nwork design, or any other HRM practices, have \nbeen examined for their impact on turnover \nintentions using longitudinal research.\nOrganisational commitment\nA single study considered the impact of HRM \ninterventions or practices on organisational \ncommitment among health professionals. No \nsystematic reviews of this relationship in the health \nsector have been found.\nDetails of studies\nOne study met the inclusion criteria (Table 26).235 \nThis study was conducted in the USA, was \nprospective in design, and the study lasted \n5 months. The study\u2019s sample was 129 health \nsector employees.\nHRM practice\nThe study examined a facet of work design, role \nconflict or ambiguity, and employee participation \nin decision-making.\nOutcomes\nThe study measured organisational commitment \nusing the Porter et al.244 OCQ.\nResults\nNeither role conflict nor employee involvement \nwas found to have any effect on organisational \ncommitment.\nOmissions\nThis study only focused on the HRM practices \nof employee involvement and a particular \njob characteristic. The impact of other HRM \npractices on health professionals\u2019 organisational \ncommitment does not appear to have been tested \nby longitudinal research.\nSummary\nThe only study that examined any potential \ncausal relationship between an HRM practice and \norganisational commitment found that neither role \nconflict nor employee participation in decision-\nmaking had any impact. However, this is the \nfinding of a single study only and must be treated \nwith caution. There is very little longitudinal \nresearch in this field in the health area.\nClimate\nA single study considered the impact on HRM \nintervention or practice on the cultural or working \nclimate among health professionals. No systematic \nreviews of this relationship in the health sector were \nfound.\nDetails of studies\nThe one study that met the inclusion criteria \n(Table 27)237 was conducted in Sweden, written \nin English in 2002, and lasted 3 years.

This \nsection is limited because the sample of included \nstudies is small. This could be partly because the \nsample was a broad search on HRM and a specific \nsearch on patient outcomes. An explicit search for \nlongitudinal studies examining specific practices \nand staff outcomes may find additional material; \nhowever, such an approach would have to surmount \nthe associated problems identified in Chapter 2.\nOverall, the findings are far from conclusive. \nPositive effects were found for team working on \nmorale and job satisfaction, for job variety on \nturnover intentions, and for job complexity on \njob satisfaction. However, these findings were \nonly demonstrated by a small number of studies, \nand job demand and control, task reallocation, \nrole ambiguity, pay and employee involvement \nwere not found to have a consistent impact on job \nsatisfaction, climate or organisational commitment.\nAlthough cross-sectional studies consistently \nfind relationships between these variables, more \nstringent longitudinal research is far more limited \nand it is therefore difficult to draw generalisable \nconclusions from this body of evidence.\n\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

It \nthen presents the narrative syntheses and data \ntables summarising the evidence for the impact of \nHRM outcomes on patient care outcomes.\nThe narrative syntheses and data tables drawing \ntogether evidence for the impact of HRM on \nintermediate outcomes in the health sector are \npresented in Chapter 6.\nChapter 2 of this report outlines the systematic \nreview methodology approaches used to guide all \nthe reviews. The search strategies for this review \nwere based on the broad HRM categories described \nin Chapter 3 and on patient outcomes.\nIn this chapter, the classification of patient \noutcomes is described first then the specific \nmethodology is described. The chapter then goes \non to describe the results.\nPatient outcomes\nOne of two principal questions to be addressed is \nwhether there is any demonstrable link between \nHRM practices and final performance outcomes in \nhealth, and between intermediate outcomes (such \nas morale and motivation) and final performance \noutcomes in health. A clear definition of this \nparticular outcome offers the only viable approach \nto dealing with this question and reducing the \nnumber of outcomes to be investigated.\nThe tender specified \u2018patient\u2019 outcome variously as \npatient care and patient outcomes, which include \npatient satisfaction, mortality rates, hospital acute \ninfection rates, clinical quality standards, and \npatient safety and well-being. However, a more \nspecific definition of patient care outcomes is not \ngiven. An earlier report commissioned by the \nSDO on the impact of HRM in the health sector77 \nfailed to examine the relationship between HRM \npractices and clearly defined patient care outcomes. \nThe type and nature of the patient care outcomes \ntherefore lacked definition. Scoping exercises were \nundertaken to examine a broad spectrum of patient \noutcomes that appear in the medical and health \nliterature, including clinical outcomes, which are \ntreatment- or condition-specific. This literature was \nvast and unmanageable, and outcomes were diverse \nand heterogeneous. It was decided to prioritise a \nset of patient outcomes based on Department of \nHealth and NHS performance literature.\nPolicy-makers and practitioners want information \nthat is locally applicable, timely and relevant.52,263 \nGiven that the invitation to tender for this \nresearch described the target audience as \u2018NHS \nmanagers, HR practitioners and researchers, \u2026 \ncommissioners, \u2026 and the NHS HR community \nas a whole\u2019, it was decided to focus on patient \ncare outcomes of relevance to these groups. \nThe Healthcare Commission NHS Performance \nIndicators264 and the NHS Improvement Plan265 \ntherefore provided a potentially good rationale \nfor examining a limited, but specific, list of patient \ncare outcomes.\nThis review focused on seven patient outcomes \nderived from the Healthcare Commission \nNHS Performance Indicators264 and the NHS \nImprovement Plan265 (Table 28). There are no \nstandard definitions for any of these outcomes. \nDefinitions used in this review are either those \nprovided by the Healthcare Commission264 \nand NHS Improvement Plan265 or the terms \nas they appear in the health services research \nliterature. For example, patient satisfaction has \nChapter 7  \nThe impact of HRM practices on final \noutcomes in the health sector\nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n86\nTABLE 28 Sources of patient care outcomes\nPatient care outcome Source\nPatient safety\n(includes infection\/HAI\/\nMRSA)\n1.

Definitions \nappearing in this review\u2019s protocols relating to \npatient care outcomes, and the related literature \nsearching, are perhaps broader and more vague \nthan would be required by standard systematic \nreview methodology, but this reflects the non-\nstandardised nature of the outcomes being \nmeasured. Further research may add to this list, \nbut it provides a sound starting point for looking \nat specific patient care outcomes of demonstrable \nrelevance to the target audience.\nPatient care outcomes considered by the review are:\nPatient safety refers to \u2018activities that prevent or \nreduce the risk of harm to patients\u2019 (NHS 1). This \nincludes activities to reduce \u2018the risk of hospital \nacquired infection\u2019 and MRSA, and to achieve \nhigh standards of hygiene and cleanliness (NHS 1 \nand 6). MRSA is also a standards indicator under \nthe Clinical Focus element of the Healthcare \nCommission Performance Indicators, which \nstates, \u2018Infection control (IC) is an integral part \nof healthcare and the NHS is working to improve \nhospital cleanliness and reduce infection rates. \nRates of infection with MRSA are an increasing \npublic concern and reducing them is a key priority \nfor the Government. Including this indicator will \nhelp maintain the profile of infection control.\u2019 \nThis outcome does not include adverse events or \nmedication errors.\nPatient centred-care refers to \u2018health care that is \nprovided in partnership with patients, their carers \nand relatives, respecting their diverse needs, \npreferences and choices\u2019 (NHS 4). This involves \ngiving \u2018patients and carers information when \nthey want or need it, seeking their feedback and \nconsulting them regarding their care, and treating \ntheir choices regarding their care or food with \nrespect\u2019 (NHS 4). This also includes taking into \naccount their views and choices regarding access to \nservices and treatments (NHS 5). It is measured in \ntwo indicators under the Patient Focus standards \nfor Acute Trusts. These are the \u2018Outpatient and \nA&E patient surveys: better information, more \nchoice\u2019 and \u2018Outpatient and A&E patient surveys: \nbuilding closer relationships\u2019 indicators. The \nformer measures \u2018patients\u2019 experience of these \naspects of care, such as information about care and \ntreatment, and involvement in care\u2019, and the latter, \n\u2018feedback from patients \u2026 taking account of their \nviews and priorities \u2026 and placing the patient at \nthe centre of health services\u2019.\nPatient waiting times refers to \u2018delay at \u2026 [the] \nstage of service delivery\u2019 (NHS 5). It is an \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Waiting times makes \nup five of the eight Key Targets and 10 of the \n16 Patient Focus Targets for Acute Trusts. These \ntargets range from standards regarding waiting \ntimes in A&E and waiting times from GP referral to \nconsultation, to the number of cancelled operations \nand delays in transfers. They also constitute three \nof the eight Key Targets and 3 of the 13 Access to \nQuality Services indicators for Primary Care Trusts.\nPatient quality of life is a common measure in \nthe health services research literature.268,269 It \nis measured in the Healthcare Commission \nPerformance Indicators using \u2018feedback from \npatients \u2026 taking account of their views and \npriorities\u2019. Patient surveys and complaints \nconstitute 5 of the 16 Patient Focus Targets for \nAcute Trusts, and 5 of the 13 Access to Quality \nServices indicators for Primary Care Trusts.\nPatient satisfaction is a common measure in \nhealth services research270\u2013273 and is covered by a \nsubstantial number of the Healthcare Commission \nPerformance Indicators. These indicators measure \n\u2018feedback from patients \u2026 taking account of their \nviews and priorities\u2019. Satisfaction, as with patient \nquality of life, makes up 5 of the 16 Patient Focus \nTargets for Acute Trusts, and 5 of the 13 Access to \nQuality Services indicators for Primary Care Trusts.\nPatient mortality rates is a common measure in \nthe health services research literature274,275 and is \ncovered by 2 of the 10 Clinical Focus standards \nof the Healthcare Commission Performance \nIndicators for Acute Trusts, and two of the nine \nImproving Health indicators for Primary Care \nTrusts.\nPatients\u2019 length of stay and re-admission rates \nare common measures in the health services \nresearch literature.274,276,277 Re-admissions that are \n\u2018potentially avoidable\u2019 are also covered by 2 of \nthe 10 Clinical Focus standards of the Healthcare \nCommission Performance Indicators for Acute \nTrusts.\nAn example of the resulting patient outcomes \nsearch strategy is given in Appendix 6. This search \nstring was modified for the different databases to \ntake account of the different keywords and thesauri \nthey use.\nMany of these outcomes are acknowledged proxies \nfor patient care, although it is also true that they \nhave their limitations.278 For example, Mitchell \nand Shortell279 point out that mortality may be \na good \u2018bottom-line outcome\u2019, but it is arguably \nmore dependent on patient characteristics than \norganisational factors, such as HRM practices.\nReview methodology\nProtocol development\nProtocols were produced for the review question \n\u2018Which HRM practices have an impact on patient \ncare outcomes?\u2019 but much was left open because \nof the lack of clear definitions and because the \nliterature itself was an unknown quantity. The \nliterature was so diverse and heterogeneous that \nnothing was fixed beyond the broad categories \nof HRM practice (Chapter 3) and the patient \noutcomes described above, and the plan for the \nsystematic search of the literature by various \nmethods. There was to be no exclusion of studies \nbased on formal quality assessment. However, \nlongitudinal study design was a criterion for \ninclusion in the review and served as a form \nof quality assessment. The details of the data \nextraction and synthesis remained open and \nflexible. Such flexibility is permitted by evolving \nsystematic review methods, especially when dealing \nwith complex literatures.52,56,58,60,63\nSearch strategy\nLiterature search strategies were developed and \nperformed on the following electronic databases: \nASSIA, BNI, Business Source Premier, Campbell \nCollaboration, CENTRAL, CDSR, CINAHL, \nDARE, DH-Data, EMBASE, HMIC, IBSS, King\u2019s \nFund database, MEDLINE, NHS EED, NRR, \nPREMEDLINE, PsycINFO, ReFeR, SSCI and SCI. \nSearch strings were modified for the different \ndatabases to take account of the different keywords \nand thesauri they use. Examples of the search \nfilters and strategies can be found in Appendices 6 \nand 7. The searching of electronic databases using \npre-designed search filters was supplemented by \nreference tracking of selected studies.\nStudy selection\nA pilot sift was conducted by two reviewers to test \nthe study selection criteria form and to assess \ninter-rater reliability. Titles and abstracts of studies \nidentified by both electronic database searching \nand reference tracking were sifted using the \nfollowing inclusion criteria.\nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n88\nStudies that:\n\u2022\t were longitudinal in design\n\u2022\t examined an intervention which could be \ndescribed as an HRM practice, such as \ntraining, work design or performance appraisal\n\u2022\t evaluated the impact of this intervention on a \npatient care outcome.\nStudies were excluded if they were unpublished \ntheses.\nAll of the identified articles were sifted by \none of the research associates and half by a \nsecond reviewer. The k-statistic for inter-rater \nreliability across the double-sifted articles was \n0.9. This complies with the standards required \nby conventional systematic review methodology.47 \nIn cases where there was disagreement, the two \nreviewers attempted to reach a consensus. If they \ncould not, a third reviewer took the decision about \ninclusion. There was no formal quality assessment \nof the studies at this stage. The only quality \ncriterion applied was that the study needed to be \nlongitudinal. Papers were included only if they had \na longitudinal study design, an HR intervention \nand a stated outcome. Papers were excluded if they \ndid not satisfy these criteria or if they were student \ntheses or dissertations.\nData extraction\nA data extraction form was piloted by two \nreviewers. This process indicated the high degree \nof heterogeneity between the studies. As a result, \nthe team designed a first-level form to extract only \nthe minimal amount of key data: study design, \nintervention, fidelity measure, outcome(s), outcome \nmeasure(s), and to identify any potentially relevant \nadditional studies. This form served two purposes. \nFirst, it enabled the team to gain a quick overview \nof the studies\u2019 interventions and outcomes in \norder to test their potential for synthesis. Given \nthe number and apparent heterogeneity of the \nstudies, more in-depth data extraction would have \nbeen time-consuming and potentially of little \nadded value. Second, reference tracking was used \nto identify additional potentially relevant studies. \nThe new forms were piloted by all six members \nof the team and questions were resolved at team \nmeetings. The data extraction was then completed \nfor each study by a single reviewer. Double data \nextraction was rejected because of the number \nof selected studies and the limited potential for \nsynthesis. This process provided a necessary \noverview of the available literature.\nData synthesis\nDespite the apparent heterogeneity of the studies, \na second stage of data extraction was then \nundertaken by the research associate leading on \nthis question (CC) when it became apparent that \nsome studies demonstrated sufficient homogeneity \nto be grouped together for synthesis. This \nadditional data extraction compiled information \non country, the unit of analysis, staff involved in \nthe intervention, sample size, length of the study, \nbottom-line results, staff outcomes and whether \nstaff variables had been used as moderators or \nmediators.\nStudy design was the principal method of quality \nweighting studies in the synthesis. RCTs were \nconsidered to be the best-quality studies because \nthis design limits the scope for bias in the study.48 \nThe next best studies had a quasi-experimental \ndesign: a research design that resembles a RCT but \nhas no random assignment. These were followed \nby prospective studies and, finally, retrospective \nstudies were considered to be the longitudinal \ndesign most vulnerable to bias. This hierarchy was \napplied in the synthesis. For example, the findings \nof a RCT are given greater weight than those \nof all other study designs examining the same \nintervention or outcomes, and the findings of a \nquasi-experimental study are given greater weight \nthan a prospective or retrospective study. As far as \npossible, the review used authors\u2019 own descriptions \nof their study\u2019s design in order to limit potential \nbias in the labelling of studies as particular designs \nby reviewers in the project team.\nThis provided all the data required for a \nworthwhile summary and synthesis of the studies.\nResults\nAfter the removal of duplicates, a total of 1277 \ncitations were identified by the searches of the \nelectronic databases and grey literature sources. \nThe titles and abstracts of retrieved citations were \nthen screened using the stated inclusion and \nexclusion criteria. At this stage, 1083 citations were \nrejected because they did not meet the required \ncriteria. Attempts were made to retrieve the full \npapers of the remaining 106 references. When \nexamining the full paper, 29 papers were rejected \nbecause they did not meet the inclusion criteria. \nReference tracking was then performed on the \nremaining 77 papers, as well as any included \npapers resulting from the reference tracking \nprocess. This process yielded 33 papers, 12 of \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n89\nwhich were rejected when the full paper was \nretrieved because they did not meet the inclusion \ncriteria. Therefore, in total, reference tracking \nyielded 21 additional references. A member of \nthe project team also encountered a relevant \npaper while working on another project. Overall, \ntherefore, 99 studies were identified (Table 29). \nThe QUOROM flow chart280 in Figure 3 explains \nhow many studies were rejected and at which stage, \nand the means by which included studies were \nidentified.\nData extraction was performed on the resulting \n99 studies, which were then categorised by \nintervention following the framework of broad \nHRM practices (developed earlier in the review and \ndescribed in Chapter 3). The tables below describe \nthe key data for the studies and the accompanying \nnarrative offers a basic synthesis of these data. \nSome studies appear under more than one \ncategory, either because the interventions being \nexamined have a number of different components \nor because the nature of the intervention means it \ncan be justifiably categorised under more than one \nheading, for example education and feedback.\nWork design\nAll of these studies consider interventions or \npractices changing or affecting the content of a job \nor the way it is to be done. The term \u2018work design\u2019 \nis rarely used in the literature relating to HRM in \nthe health sector and is not used to describe any \nof the interventions in this sample of longitudinal \nresearch. However, the interventions fall under the \nheading of \u2018work or job design\u2019 because they all \ninvolve the redesign or extension of job content. \nThe absence of any existing systematic review or \nmeta-analysis of health sector studies described \nas work design may be explained by difficulties \nin creating a clear, structured definition of work \ndesign or operationalising the concept as a search \nstrategy. It may also have been prevented by the \npotentially limited number of relevant studies \nand the heterogeneity of their interventions and \noutcomes, as demonstrated by this sample. In \nfact, there is only one meta-analysis covering job \nenrichment, an element of work design, in the non-\nhealth sector.281\nDetails of studies\nFourteen studies met the inclusion criteria (Table \n30). All studies were published in English, with \nthe earliest being published in 1992. Eight studies \nwere conducted in the USA, four in the UK, one in \nHong Kong and one in Australia. One study used \nan experimental design, but most of the studies \nused a prospective longitudinal design, and there \nwere also three retrospective studies. The studies \nvaried in duration, from 6 weeks to 3 years. The \nsample sizes ranged from as few as 10 staff or 38 \npatients to 879 staff or 5037 patients, depending \non the outcomes being studied. In three studies \nthe relevant patient sample size was not given. \nTABLE 29 Summary of studies included by HRM practice\nHRM practice Subcategories No. of studies\nSystematic reviews: \nhealth sector\nWork design 14 0\nStaffing Staffing levels and working \nhours\n19 2\nInnovation 13 5\nSubstitution 23 5\nTransfer 8 5\nTraining and development 16 5\nCompensation and rewards 3 7\nCommunication 0 0\nFamily friendly 0 0\nSingle status 0 0\nEmployee involvement 5 0\nPerformance management, \nappraisal\n7 0\nBundles 0 0\nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n90\n \nApplication of \ninclusion criteria to \nfull papers by three \nreviewers \nApplication of \ninclusion criteria to \ntitles and abstracts by \nthree reviewers \nTotal citations from \nelectronic database \nsearches (n = 1277) \nTotal studies after first \nsift (n = 106) \nTotal studies after \nsecond sift (n = 77) \nSerendipity (n = 1) \nFinal total of studies \nsatisfying inclusion \ncriteria (n = 99) \nReferences satisfying\ninclusion criteria from\nreference tracking of\nincluded papers (n = 21)\n \nFIGURE 3 QUOROM\u2002flow\u2002chart\u2002for\u2002patient\u2002outcomes\u2002review.\nIn all cases the unit of analysis consisted of units \nor specific services or departments in hospitals, \nincluding emergency departments.\nHRM practice\nAll of the interventions considered here involved \nthe introduction of new systems or programmes \naffecting either who performed what tasks within a \nteam or how work was allocated to team members. \nHowever, analysis of the literature reveals that some \nof the interventions studied may be placed into two \ngroups, each containing three studies.\nIn the first group, three studies, two by the \nsame authors, examined the implementation \nof an outcomes management model of working \ndeveloped from quality circles: jobs were \nredesigned with the intention of achieving outcome \nbenchmarks.282\u2013284\nIn the second group of three studies, the \nintervention focused on skill enhancement of nurse \npractitioners (NPs), i.e. nurses taking on expanded \nroles. This involved an increase in workload and \nthe assumption of more duties by these staff, \nor a redistribution of workload combined with \nincreased supervision of more junior members \nof staff.232,248,285 In two of these studies, this job \nredesign was accompanied by education of relevant \nstaff members to facilitate the revision or extension \nof roles.232,248\nThe remaining studies all involved elements of \njob redesign, including within the interventions \ncomponents such as team working231,286 and \nredesigned task allocation.231,287,288 One study \nmeasured the fidelity with which the new systems \nwere implemented by recording when protocols \nrequired by the new system were activated.284 \nHowever, none of the other studies reported any \nmeasures of implementation fidelity for the systems \nor programmes being examined.\nOutcomes\nThe three outcomes management studies all \nresearched the impact of this model on patient \nlength of stay, but had no other outcomes in \ncommon. Two of the three studies evaluating skill \nenhancement for NPs measured both patient \nsatisfaction and staff satisfaction. One study used \nvalidated scales for both of these outcomes,232 but \nthe other study used its own instruments.248 The \nremaining seven outcomes measured by these \nstudies were all different. The latter study also \nassessed other staff psychological and behavioural \noutcomes, including the ability to supervise staff \nand workload.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Patient satisfaction was \nmeasured by five studies and waiting times by four. \nOverall, unlike the majority of other interventions \nconsidered by the longitudinal research included \nin this review, several work design studies did \nexamine staff psychological outcomes. Six studies \nmeasured job satisfaction, employee satisfaction or \nmorale. None of these outcomes was analysed as a \nmoderator or mediator but only as direct outcomes, \nand the job and employee satisfaction measures \nused by these studies were all different.\nResults\nTwo of the three studies evaluating the outcomes \nmanagement model found that this intervention \nhad a positive effect on all outcomes, which \nincluded length of stay and patient mortality \nrates.282,283 However, the third study found that the \nimpact of this intervention on outcomes such as \nlength of stay was positive, but not significant.284 All \nthree studies used a prospective cohort design with \nhistorical controls.\nIn the group of skills enhancement studies, one \nintervention (workload redistribution) had no \nsignificant positive or adverse effect on staff or \npatient satisfaction.232 A second study, using a \nsuperior experimental design, also examining the \nrelationship between increased role responsibility \nand these outcomes, found that the intervention \nhad a positive effect on morale, but no significant \nimpact on patient satisfaction.248 The weakest \nstudy in this group in terms of study design only \nmeasured the impact of the intervention on length \nof stay, and found a significant positive effect.285\nIn the remaining studies, the work redesign \nintervention significantly improved patient \nsatisfaction in almost every study that measured \nthis outcome,230,249,287,289 although one study \nfound that the provision of continuity of care \nby physicians, as opposed to their rotation, \nmade no difference to patient satisfaction or \npatients\u2019 perception of the atmosphere in a \nward.288 However, all three studies examining the \nimpact of interventions on staff psychological \noutcomes found a significant positive impact \non these outcomes,230,231,249 and all four studies \nexamining waiting times found significant positive \noutcomes.249,286,287,290 In the four studies examining \nfinancial performance or cost as an outcome, the \nresults were positive for three of the interventions, \nand only had no effect in the case of re-engineering \nwork design for patient-focused care.230 Prospective \nand retrospective designs all produced the same \ninconsistent results.\nOmissions\nThe unit of analysis used by these studies did not \ninclude the hospital or primary or community \ncare. Several staff outcomes were measured \nby these studies, but no study controlled for \nany staff variables and none examined these \nstaff psychological or behavioural variables as \nmoderators or mediators of the relationships \nbeing evaluated. Unlike many other interventions \nconsidered by this review, only two patient safety \nindicators were examined as an outcome by any \nof these studies: errors and urinary tract infection \n(UTI) rates; and only one study considered \nmortality rates.\nSummary\nThe job design interventions considered here had \ncertain basic elements in common, but they also \ndiffered markedly in parts of their content. Neither \noutcomes management nor skill enhancement \ninterventions demonstrated consistent results, \nbut other job and work design interventions all \nhad positive effects on staff satisfaction, patient \nsatisfaction and patient waiting times.\nStaffing level and working hours\nThese studies consider research into two elements \nof staffing practice: staffing level and staff working \nhours. The staffing level literature considers \nwhether increased ratios of staff\u2013patients improve \npatient care outcomes or whether decreased \nratios have an adverse effect on these outcomes. \nThis ratio may relate either to numbers of staff \nor to grades of staff, such as registered nurses \n(RNs). There is one systematic review of studies \nof staffing levels in the health sector.295 Two of the \nlongitudinal studies described below have been \nincluded in this previous systematic review.296,297 \nHowever, the majority have not been included in \nexisting systematic reviews and therefore add to \nthe review literature on this topic. There are no \nsystematic reviews or meta-analyses on staffing \nlevels in the non-health sector HRM literature.\nThe working hours literature considers both \nthe variable of total numbers of hours worked \nand interventions that affect the number of \nhours worked by health professionals, especially \nreductions or rescheduling. There are two meta-\nanalyses that include studies of health sector \nworking hours, reflecting the sizeable number of \nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n92 TA\nB\nLE\n 3\n0

This sample therefore adds to \nthe review literature on this topic. There is only \none meta-analysis in the non-health sector HRM \nliterature reviewing studies on a similar subject.300\nDetails of studies\nNineteen studies met the inclusion criteria (Table \n31). All were published in English, with the earliest \nbeing published in 1988, and all but three of the \nstudies were conducted in North America. Most \nof the studies used a retrospective or prospective \nlongitudinal design, but there was one RCT.301 \nThe studies varied in duration, from 3 months \nto 7 years. The sample sizes ranged from 347 to \nmore than 300,000 patients, although in five cases \nthe study\u2019s sample size was not given. In terms of \nunits of analysis, seven studies used the hospital as \nthe unit and 12 used units or specific services or \ndepartments in hospitals.\nHRM practice\nAnalysis of the literature reveals that these \nlongitudinal studies may be examined in \nthree separate groups: six studies examine the \nrelationship between patient care outcomes and \nthe total number of hours worked by staff; six \nstudies look at how nurse or medical staff\u2013patient \nratios impact on patient care outcomes; and seven \nstudies compare the effect of shifts of different \nlengths being worked by physicians, for example \nlong hours compared with an overall reduced \ntotal numbers of hours or shifts of shorter hours. \nIn the case of this last grouping of studies, the \nintervention was often introduced as a consequence \nof new working hour limits. The fidelity with which \nthese interventions were implemented was clearly \nmeasured in only one study,302 but there was also \nsome monitoring of compliance in another.303\nOutcomes\nIn the first two groups, all but one of the studies \nexamined the relationship between staffing or \nworking hours and a single patient care outcome. \nThree of the studies that examined total number of \nhours worked all looked at the outcome of patient \nsatisfaction. These three studies used two different \nmeasures and the two studies which used the same \npatient satisfaction measure reported different \nfindings.297,304 The three other studies examining \ntotal number of hours worked looked at three very \ndifferent outcomes; length of stay, mortality and \nprescribing errors. Four of the nurse\u2013patient ratio \nstudies looked at the same outcome: in-hospital \nmortality. One of the nurse\u2013patient ratio studies \nmeasured the patient safety variable \u2018unplanned \nextubations\u2019. The remaining study from this cluster \nconsidered the staff outcome: medically certified \nsick leave.\nThe studies comparing different lengths of working \nhours can be separated further into several smaller \ngroups examining three or more of the same \nor similar outcomes. Four studies investigated \nthe relationship between this intervention and \nmortality rates. In only one study was this the only \noutcome; the remainder all evaluated multiple \noutcomes. Three examined the relationship with \nlength of stay, medication errors and adverse \nevents, although these last-named outcomes were \nonly nominally the same. In total, an additional 15 \ndifferent outcomes were also examined by these \nstudies. Five of the seven studies assessed multiple \noutcomes rather than a single outcome.\nResults\nTwo of the studies examining the impact of total \nnumber of hours worked found that this variable \nhad no impact on patient satisfaction,297,305 and \ntwo others found no significant relationship with \nmortality or prescribing errors.296,306 Only one study \nfound lower numbers of hours to be associated with \nlower satisfaction among patients, and one study \nfound that higher nurse intensity, that is, more \nhours, led to decreased length of stay.307 All of these \nstudies used either retrospective or prospective \nstudy designs.\nThe results for the four nurse\u2013patient ratio studies \nexamining the outcome of mortality rates were \ninconsistent. The two prospective studies found \nthat there was no significant association with \nmortality rates regardless of the ratio,308,309 while \nthe two studies using a less powerful retrospective \ndesign did find that higher ratios of staff\u2013patient \nproduced lower mortality rates.310,311 The results \nof these latter two studies may also have been \ndetermined by their patient population of newborn \nchildren, which was very different from the adult \npopulations of the two studies that reported no \neffect. A lower nurse\u2013patient ratio was found to \nhave the negative effect of increased unplanned \nextubations and increased sick leave absences by \nhead nurses.312,313\nTwo of the seven studies examining reduced \nworking hours recorded some negative outcomes, \nsuch as an increase in certain complications, \nnegative patient safety indicators and delays in \nthe provision of some diagnostic tests.

In fact, some of the \npositive outcomes were found by the more powerful \nRCT.301\nOmissions\nNone of the studies reported here took emergency \ndepartments or primary or community care \nas its unit of analysis. Also, staff psychological \nor behavioural outcome (sick leave) was only \nmeasured by one of these studies, but no study \ncontrolled for any staff variables and none \nexamined these variables as moderators or \nmediators of the relationships being evaluated.\nSummary\nAccording to this sample of longitudinal research, \nneither lower numbers of hours worked nor the \nreduction of working hours appears to have an \nadverse effect on mortality rates, length of stay, \ntransfers to intensive care, discharge disposition, \nprescribing or medication errors, complications, \nre-admissions, reinterventions, cost per patient or \nadverse events. These variables may potentially \nhave a negative effect on patient satisfaction, \nalthough they may equally have some positive \neffect on some patient outcomes. The evidence on \nstaff\u2013patient ratios is inconsistent for mortality as \na patient outcome, although those studies with a \nsuperior design suggest there is no adverse effect. \nHowever, the research also indicates that lower \nnurse\u2013patient ratios may lead to adverse events \nand increased absences among senior nursing staff.\nIntroduction of a new type of \nworker to existing teams or \nservices\nThe staffing category includes skill mix at work, \nwhich involves \u2018practices affecting enhancement \n(increasing depth of job by extending roles of \nskills), substitution (working across professional \ndivides or exchanging one type of worker for \nanother), delegation, innovation (creating new \njobs by introducing a new type of worker), transfer \nof services, relocation of staff and services, and \nliaison (using specialists in one sector to educate \nand support staff in another)\u2019.318 The following \nsynthesis focuses on studies researching innovation: \nthe introduction of a new type of worker to existing \nteams or services. There are five recent systematic \nreviews or meta-analyses on staffing in the health \nsector workforce, reflecting both the sizeable \nnumber of studies and the growing interest in this \nfield.295,319\u2013322 However, only one of the studies \ndescribed below has been included in any of these \nsystematic reviews.323 There is no meta-analysis in \nthe non-health sector HRM literature reviewing \nstudies on a similar subject.\nDetails of studies\nThirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (Table \n32). All were published in English, with the earliest \nbeing published in 1988. Eight studies were \nconducted in the USA, two from Australia, and \none each in the UK, Switzerland and Turkey. Of \nthe 13 studies, one was experimental,324 nine were \nprospective in design and three were retrospective. \nThe studies varied in duration, from 1 month to \n5 years, and the sample sizes ranged from 203 to \n6909 patients. However, no sample size was given \nby five studies. Almost all of these studies were \nconducted on units, wards or specific hospital \nservices or departments. There was one study of a \ncommunity nursing home.\nHRM practice\nAnalysis of the literature reveals that the \ninterventions studied may be examined in \nthree groups. Five studies look at whether the \nintroduction of physicians with specific training \nor skills has any impact on patient care outcomes. \nFive studies compare the impact on patient care of \nteams made up of physicians alone versus teams \ncomposed of physicians and newly introduced \nNPs. Finally, three studies examine the impact of \nthe creation of new NP or senior nurse services. \nThe units of analysis were all either emergency \ndepartments or intensive care units (ICUs). None \nof the studies made any attempt to measure the \nfidelity with which the new staffing practice was \nbeing implemented.\nOutcomes\nThe five studies which looked at the introduction \nof new types of physicians assessed a small number \nof consistent outcomes. Four of the five studies \nassessed one outcome only, either length of stay, \nmortality or discharge rates. Length of stay was \nevaluated by three of the five studies and mortality \nby two. There were only two additional patient \noutcomes.\nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n98 TA\nB\nLE\n 3\n1 \nSt\naf\nfin\ng\u2002\nle\nve\nl\u2002a\nnd\n\u2002w\nor\nki\nng\n\u2002h\nou\nrs\nSt\nud\ny \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, \ndu\nra\nti\non\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nBo\nlto\nn \net\n a\nl. \n(2\n00\n3)\n30\n4\nU\nSA\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nhi\nst\nor\nic\nal\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\nU\nnk\nno\nw\nn\n18\n m\non\nth\ns\nTo\nta\nl h\nou\nrs\n o\nf n\nur\nsi\nng\n c\nar\ne \npe\nr \npa\ntie\nnt\n-d\nay\n (\np.\n 6\n10\n)\nN\no\nPa\ntie\nnt\n p\ner\nce\npt\nio\nns\n \nof\n c\nar\ne\nPi\nck\ner\n In\nst\nitu\nte\n In\npa\ntie\nnt\n \nQ\nue\nst\nio\nnn\nai\nre\n (\np.\n 6\n09\n)\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nLo\nw\ner\n n\num\nbe\nr \nof\n t\not\nal\n n\nur\nsi\nng\n h\nou\nrs\n p\ner\n \npa\ntie\nnt\n, l\nes\ns \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn\nPo\ntt\ner\n e\nt a\nl. \n \n(2\n00\n3)\n30\n5\nU\nSA\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nhi\nst\nor\nic\nal\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\nU\nnk\nno\nw\nn\n12\n m\non\nth\ns\nN\nur\nse\n s\nta\nffi\nng\nM\nea\nsu\nre\ns:\nA\nve\nra\nge\n n\num\nbe\nr \nof\n h\nou\nrs\n o\nf \nnu\nrs\nin\ng \nca\nre\n p\ner\n p\nat\nie\nnt\n p\ner\n \nda\ny \non\n t\nhe\n d\nay\n s\nhi\nft\n (\np.\n 1\n61\n)\nN\no\nPa\ntie\nnt\n s\nat\nis\nfa\nct\nio\nn \n(p\nos\nt \ndi\nsc\nha\nrg\ne)\n (\np.\n \n15\n9)\nPa\ntie\nnt\n s\nat\nis\nfa\nct\nio\nn \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n (\nBu\nrr\nou\ngh\ns \net\n a\nl. \n19\n99\n)3\n17\nN\no \nef\nfe\nct\nD\nav\nyd\nov\n e\nt a\nl. \n \n(2\n00\n4)\n30\n6\nU\nSA\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nhi\nst\nor\nic\nal\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\nU\nnk\nno\nw\nn\n3 \nm\non\nth\ns\nN\no.\n o\nf h\nou\nrs\n w\nor\nke\nd\nN\no\nEr\nro\nrs\n in\n p\nre\nsc\nri\nbi\nng\nEr\nro\nrs\n p\ner\n h\nou\nr \nw\nor\nke\nd\nN\no \nef\nfe\nct\n: N\no \nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\n \nas\nso\nci\nat\nio\nn \nbe\ntw\nee\nn \ner\nro\nrs\n \nan\nd \nnu\nm\nbe\nrs\n o\nf h\nou\nrs\n w\nor\nke\nd\nBe\ngl\nin\nge\nr \n(2\n00\n6)\n30\n7\nU\nSA\nRe\ntr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne\nU\nnk\nno\nw\nn\n13\n y\nea\nrs\nN\no.\n o\nf h\nou\nrs\n w\nor\nke\nd \nby\n \nnu\nrs\nes\nN\no\nLe\nng\nth\n o\nf s\nta\ny\nRo\nut\nin\ne \nda\nta\n c\nol\nle\nct\nio\nn\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nD\nec\nre\nas\ned\n \nle\nng\nth\n o\nf s\nta\ny\nTo\nur\nan\nge\nau\n e\nt \nal\n.

All rights reserved.\n101\nLength of stay was the only outcome examined by \nmore than one of the five studies examining the \nintroduction of NPs or senior nurses into physician \nteams. This outcome was evaluated in four of these \nstudies. The remaining 15 outcomes evaluated by \nthese studies were all different. Only one of these \nstudies evaluated any staff psychological outcomes: \nstaff satisfaction with the new service.262\nIn the grouping of three studies examining the \nnew introduction of a new nurse service, length of \nstay and patient satisfaction were both measured \nin two studies. The two patient satisfaction studies \nused different scales and none was an established \nmeasure. Four other outcomes were also evaluated \nby these studies.\nResults\nThe results of those studies that examined the \nintroduction of new types of physicians were \nconsistently positive. This intervention was found \nto reduce mortality rates significantly in both \nstudies examining this outcome,325,326 and reduce \nlength of stay in two of the three studies evaluating \nthis variable.324,327 All other outcomes were also \npositively affected.328 Different study designs \nproduced the same outcomes.\nResults for the studies examining innovative joint \nworking between physicians and NPs were very \ninconsistent. A positive effect was found in three of \nthe four studies examining length of stay,285,329,330 \nbut many of the remaining diverse outcomes being \nmeasured showed no effect at all, regardless of \nquality of study design.262,331\nTwo of the three studies examining the \nintroduction of a new nurse service found \nconsistently positive outcomes for length of stay, \nwaiting times and patient satisfaction,323,332 but the \nthird study, which was of much longer duration, \nfound no effect on the outcomes of length of \nstay and re-admission rates.333 All of the studies \nemployed a similar prospective design.\nOmissions\nNone of the studies reported here took primary \ncare or the hospital as its unit of analysis. Only \none study measured any staff psychological or \nbehavioural outcomes, and no study controlled \nfor any of these variables or examined them as \nmoderators or mediators of the relationships being \nevaluated. The key patient outcome of patient \nsafety was not considered by longitudinal studies \nlooking at this type of innovative intervention.\nSummary\nThis sample describes longitudinal research \nrelating to innovation in the skill mix of staff \nmembers. The small samples of studies examining \nthe introduction of new specially trained physicians \nand new nurse services both found that these \ninterventions had positive effects on most of the \noutcomes being tested, especially length of stay, \nmortality and patient satisfaction. However, the \nresults were far less consistent for the introduction \nof NPs or their equivalent into teams with \nphysicians, when this new team was compared with \nteams of physicians alone.\nSubstitution of one type of staff \nfor another\nThe following synthesis focuses on studies \nresearching substitution. There are five recent \nsystematic reviews or meta-analyses on staffing in \nthe health sector workforce, reflecting both the \nsizeable number of studies and growing interest in \nthis field.295,319\u2013322 However, only three of the studies \ndescribed below have been included in any of \nthese systematic reviews,296,334,335 so this sample also \nclearly adds to the review literature on this topic. \nThere is no meta-analysis in the non-health sector \nHRM literature reviewing studies on a similar \nsubject.\nDetails of studies\nTwenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria \n(Table 33). All studies were published in English, \nwith the earliest being published in 1982. Nineteen \nstudies were conducted in the USA. Most of the \nstudies employed a prospective or retrospective \nlongitudinal design, but there was one RCT and \nthree studies used a quasi-experimental design. \nThe studies varied in duration, from 6 weeks to \n6 years, and the sample sizes ranged from 96 to \nmore than 100,000 patients. The studies focused \non different units of analysis. In 15 cases, the unit \nwas a hospital unit, ward or specific service or \ndepartment; in seven cases a hospital; and in one \ncase a primary care practice.\nHRM practice\nAnalysis of the literature reveals that the \ninterventions studied may be examined in three \ngroups. The largest group of 14 studies compared \nresults found for the substitution of RNs, regular \nor employed nurses with other nursing grades or \nmembers of staff. Substitute staff included pool or \nbank staff, nursing aides (NAs), contract nurses, \npatient care associates, licensed practice nurses, \nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n102 TA\nB\nLE\n 3\n2 \nIn\nno\nva\ntio\nn\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, \ndu\nra\nti\non\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nPa\nrt\nov\ni e\nt a\nl. \n(2\n00\n1)\n32\n4\nU\nSA\nEx\npe\nri\nm\nen\nta\nl\nU\nnk\nno\nw\nn\n16\n w\nee\nks\nFa\ncu\nlt\ny \n(a\ndd\niti\non\nal\n s\nta\nff \nm\nem\nbe\nr)\n v\ns \nno\n fa\ncu\nlt\ny \ntr\nia\nge\n \n(s\nki\nll \nm\nix\n)\nN\no\nLe\nng\nth\n o\nf s\nta\ny\nRo\nut\nin\ne \nda\nta\n c\nol\nle\nct\nio\nn:\n N\nur\nse\n \ntr\nia\nge\n t\nim\ne \nto\n n\nur\nse\n d\nis\nch\nar\nge\n \ntim\ne\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nFa\ncu\nlt\ny \ntr\nia\nge\n s\nig\nni\nfic\nan\ntl\ny \nre\ndu\nce\nd \nLO\nS\nTo\npe\nli \net\n a\nl. \n(2\n00\n5)\n32\n5\nTu\nrk\ney\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nhi\nst\nor\nic\nal\n c\non\ntr\nol\ns\n55\n9 \npa\ntie\nnt\ns\n23\n m\non\nth\ns\nN\new\n s\nta\nff:\n a\nn \nin\nte\nns\niv\nis\nt \npl\nus\n c\nlo\nse\nd \nIC\nU\n p\nol\nic\ny \nvs\n n\no \nin\nte\nns\niv\nis\nt \npl\nus\n o\npe\nn \npo\nlic\ny\nN\no \n\u2013 \nim\npl\nem\nen\nta\ntio\nn \nm\nor\ne \nth\nan\n ju\nst\n \na \nne\nw\n s\nta\nff \nm\nem\nbe\nr\nM\nor\nta\nlit\ny;\n le\nng\nth\n o\nf \nst\nay\n in\n IC\nU\n;

Therefore, despite the \napparent homogeneity of the intervention, the \nsubstitutes were not always the same. However, 13 \nof these 14 studies focused exclusively on nursing \nstaff.\nIn the same way, the second largest group (a group \nof five studies) examined the substitution of one \ntype of physician for another, such as part-time for \nfull-time physicians. However, in each case both \nthe physician being replaced and his\/her substitute \nwere different.\nThe final group of four studies examined the \nreplacement of physicians by NPs or senior \nnurses. Once again, however, the details of each \nintervention were different. None of the studies \nmade any attempt to measure the fidelity with \nwhich the intervention was being implemented.\nOutcomes\nIn the group of 14 studies examining the \nsubstitution of one type of nurse for another, or \nfor a more junior member of health staff, only \nfour patient outcome measures were examined \nby more than one study: patient satisfaction, \nmortality, quality of nursing care and length of \nstay. Six studies considered the outcome of patient \nsatisfaction and all used different measures or \ntools, only three of which were named scales (Press\u2013\nGaney Survey; Burroughs Patient Satisfaction \nMeasure; Patient Judgement of Hospital Quality \nQuestionnaire). Quality of nursing care was \nalso only measured by a recognised instrument \n(Hinshaw and Atwood336 scale) in one of the two \nstudies examining this outcome. Four studies \nevaluated mortality rates as an outcome and three \nlength of stay. Cost was the only other outcome to \nbe measured by more than one study. These twelve \nstudies also measured an additional 13 different \noutcomes, several of which related to patient safety, \nsuch as patient falls. Jung et al.232 also measured \na number of staff psychological and behavioural \noutcomes, including job satisfaction, ability to \nsupervise staff and workload. This was the only one \nof the 23 substitution studies to measure any staff \noutcomes.\nThe group of five studies examining the \nsubstitution of one physician for another made a \nmore limited but consistent choice of outcomes. \nMortality was measured as an outcome by three \nstudies, and was the only outcome examined by two \nof these studies. Other outcomes measured were \nlength of stay, transfer time, patient satisfaction \nand adverse events. Unlike the studies focusing \nalmost exclusively on nurses, there was little \nconsideration of patient satisfaction or patient \nsafety.\nMortality was the only outcome to be examined by \nmore than one study in the group examining the \nreplacement of physicians by NPs or senior nurses. \nThe remaining eight outcomes were all different. \nPatient satisfaction was measured by one study; \nonce again the researchers used their own scale.\nResults\nResults for interventions examining the \nsubstitution of one type of nurse for another, or \nfor a more junior member of health staff, were \ninconsistent. Two prospective studies found that \nthe higher the ratio of RNs, the higher the patient \nsatisfaction,305,337 but another study, using a higher-\nquality experimental design, found that using \nRNs alone was less effective at improving patient \nsatisfaction than replacing some RNs with NAs.338 \nThe use of more RNs or regular nurses compared \nto other grades was also positively associated \nwith lower mortality rates by all five studies that \nexamined this outcome, although all of these \nstudies were retrospective, which is the weakest \nform of longitudinal study design. All-RN staffing \nversus staffing by temporary nurses or other grades \nwas found to have a positive impact on length of \nstay, and, in a study of a burns unit, infection rates \namong patients. Employee nurses were also found \nto have a better impact on quality of nursing care \nand patient satisfaction than contract nurses.339 \nHowever, the remaining three studies found that \nthe substitution of RNs with others generally had \nno effect on outcomes.232,340,341\nResults from those studies examining the \nsubstitution of one physician for another were \nagain inconsistent. In two cases there was no effect \non mortality rates,342,343 but one did have a positive \neffect.344 However, the latter was a retrospective \nstudy344 and one of the studies that found no effect \nwas a RCT,343 the results of which may be more \nrobust. Cross-coverage by physicians was found \nto have a negative effect on adverse events when \ncompared to residency345 but otherwise there was \nno significant effect, either positive or negative, on \nalmost any of the remaining outcomes.342,343,346 Only \nthe study of full- versus part-time primary care \nphysicians controlled for any staff variables, but \nthese were purely demographic.346\nThe studies examining the replacement of \nphysicians by NPs or senior nurses generally found \nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n106\nthat such a substitution had no adverse effect \non the outcomes measured, regardless of study \ndesign.290,347\u2013349 Two studies in this group also \nindicated that this intervention had a positive effect \non patient satisfaction and some waiting times, \nalthough these studies used less reliable prospective \ndesigns.290,348\nOmissions\nAll of the principal patient care outcomes were \ncovered by this sample of studies. However, only \none study measured any staff psychological or \nbehavioural outcome, and no study controlled \nfor any of these variables or examined them as \nmoderators or mediators of the relationships being \nevaluated.\nSummary\nThis sample describes longitudinal research \nrelating to substitution of staff members in the \nhealth sector literature. This research suggests that \nstaffing by RNs only, rather than their replacement \nwith other grades of staff, is better for mortality \nrates, length of stay and some infection rates \nbut has limited impact on other outcomes. The \nreplacement of one type of physician with another \nwas also shown to have neither an adverse nor \npositive impact on patient outcomes. The most \nconsistent results were found for the replacement \nof physicians with senior nursing staff: there were \nno adverse effects as a result of this substitution.\nTransfer or relocation of staff \nand services\nThe following synthesis focuses on studies \nresearching transfer or relocation of services. There \nare five recent systematic reviews or meta-analyses \non staffing in the health sector workforce, reflecting \nthe sizeable number of studies in this field and \nthe growing interest in this field.295,319\u2013322 However, \nonly one of the studies described below has been \nincluded in any of these systematic reviews.335 \nThere is no meta-analysis in the non-health sector \nHRM literature reviewing studies on a similar \nsubject.\nDetails of studies\nEight studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 34). \nAll were published in English, with the earliest \nbeing published in 1984. Six of the studies were \nconducted in the USA, one in the UK and one in \nAustralia. The studies used either a prospective \nor a retrospective design. The studies varied \nin duration, from 6 months to 3 years, and the \nsample sizes ranged from 274 to more than 22,000 \npatients. All eight studies were conducted on units, \nwards or specific services.\nHRM practice\nAnalysis of the literature reveals that the \ninterventions studied may be examined in two \ngroups.335,355\u2013357 Four studies all examine the same \nintervention: the specific transfer of services to a \nparticular team of physicians, to the exclusion of \nphysicians who were previously involved in the care \nunder a different model. These studies examined \nthe impact of a move from open ICUs, in which the \nphysician responsible for admission retained some \ninput into a patient\u2019s care, to closed units in which \ncare was controlled exclusively by the intensive unit \ncritical care team. The remaining four studies may \nalso be grouped together because they examine \nthe effect on patient care outcomes of the presence \nor absence of certain physicians, although in each \ncase the unit of analysis, and, therefore, the type \nof physician, was different. None of these studies \nmade any attempt to measure the fidelity with \nwhich the intervention was being implemented.\nOutcomes\nThe group of studies evaluating open versus closed \nICUs all considered mortality as an outcome. In \none study it was the only outcome measured, but \nin the remainder it was one of multiple outcomes: \nlength of stay and duration of mechanical \nventilation were examined as outcomes by two of \nthese studies, but eight further different outcomes \nwere also studied.\nIn the same way, in the remaining four studies, two \noutcomes were examined by two studies: mortality \nrates and length of stay.253,358 Mortality was the only \noutcome measured by one study.359 The remaining \nstudies measured an additional nine different \noutcomes. Only one study focused on patients\u2019 \nperceptions of quality of care and used the Picker \nCommonwealth Institute Questionnaire.253\nResults\nThe studies examining the impact of the presence \nor absence of a physician found inconsistent results \nregarding mortality rates and waiting times,335,355,357 \nand found that the practice had no effect at all \non length of stay.356,357 These studies all used a \nretrospective study design.\nIn the group of four studies examining open \nversus closed ICUs, three found that the \npractice of closing the unit significantly reduced \nmortality.253,359,360 However, one of the two studies \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

For \nexample, two studies examined length of stay and \nfound differing results.253,358 The different results \nwere not related to quality of study design as both \nstudies employed a form of prospective design.\nThese eight studies covered all of the key patient \noutcomes, although the patient safety variables \nwere limited.\nOmissions\nNone of the studies reported here took the hospital \nor primary or community care practices as their \nunit of analysis, and none controlled for any staff \nvariables or examined them as moderators or \nmediators of the relationships being evaluated.\nSummary\nThis sample describes longitudinal research \nrelating to the transfer or relocation of staff and \nservices. Despite the apparent homogeneity of \nsuch practices or interventions, there is still a great \ndeal of heterogeneity between these studies in \nterms of outcomes and units of analysis. Also, only \none study232 measured any staff psychological or \nbehavioural outcome.\nThe results derived from similar interventions \n(such as the move to closed from open ICUs) either \nhad a positive effect, or no effect at all, in equal \nmeasure. These findings, in combination with \nthe small number of studies, means that no firm \nconclusions can be reached about the relationship \nbetween patient outcomes and the location of \nphysicians on- or off-site, or the transfer of services \nto exclude certain types of physician.\nTraining\nAll of these studies consider interventions that \ninvolve some form of training or education for \nhealth staff and its impact on patient and staff \noutcomes. Studies have only been included if \nthe entire practice was training or if training \nwas a primary element of an HRM practice. A \nnumber of studies have been excluded because \neducation or training was only one element of a \nmultifaceted intervention in which none of the \nother components could be described as falling \nwithin the field of HRM.361,362 There are five \nexisting systematic reviews or meta-analyses of \ntraining and development interventions in the \nhealth sector. Three examine forms of continuing \nmedical education for physicians and their \nimpact on physician performance and health-care \noutcomes.363\u2013365 The two other reviews examine \nsystems of continuing professional development to \nenhance the recruitment and retention of specific \nhealth professionals.299,366 There are also three \nmeta-analyses of training practices from the non-\nhealth sector. These focus on elements of training \nthat are very different from those examined for \nhealth, such as altering organisational behaviour,367 \nmentoring368 and evaluating the effectiveness of \norganisational training.369 None of the studies \nreviewed below appear in any of these systematic \nreviews. A narrative synthesis has been undertaken \ndue to the general heterogeneity of the studies in \nthis sample.\nDetails of studies\nSixteen studies met the inclusion criteria (Table \n35). All studies were published in English, with the \nearliest being published in 1988. Eight studies were \nconducted in the USA, two in Argentina, and one \neach in the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, Pakistan, \nTaiwan and Macedonia. Most of the studies \nemployed a prospective longitudinal design, but \nthere were two RCTs256,370 and one experimental \nstudy.371\nThe studies varied in duration, from 6 months \nto more than 6 years. The length of the study \nperiod was not given by one paper. The sample \nsizes ranged from as few as 35 patients or 76 staff \nto 1411 patients or 649 staff, depending on the \noutcomes being studied.

The majority of these \nstudies concerned both nurses and physicians. \nOther than the group of training and feedback \nstudies, no study clearly measured the fidelity with \nwhich the training programmes were implemented, \nalthough two studies did acknowledge barriers to \nfull implementation.\nOutcomes\nAlmost one-half of the studies focused on a single \nspecific outcome: infection rates. Three of these \nstudies looked at ventilator-associated pneumonia, \ntwo at bloodstream infections (BSIs), one at UTIs \nand one at nosocomial infections generally. In each \ncase, the measure was the number of infections per \n1000 days of the relevant device.\nUnlike many of the other interventions considered \nby HRM studies in the health sector, several \ntraining studies did examine staff outcomes, \nusually knowledge or beliefs. In each case, this \noutcome was measured in conjunction with at least \none other outcome, usually patient satisfaction. \nIn three studies, increased staff knowledge was \na specific and primary outcome of the training \nintervention. However, in each case the knowledge \nbeing assessed was different, so the scales used to \nmeasure this knowledge were different. In the same \nway, three studies measured patient satisfaction \nor perceptions of care, and all three studies used \ndifferent measures.\nResults\nWith a single exception \u2013 Cohran et al.\u2019s study372 \n\u2013 the training interventions designed to address \nthe specific outcome of infection rates all had \na significant positive effect on infection rates. \nFour of the five studies that combined training \nwith some form of performance monitoring, \nsuch as evaluation and feedback, had positive \noutcomes,373\u2013376 and both studies examining \neducation alone had positive outcomes.377,378 All of \nthe studies used a prospective cohort design with \nhistorical controls.\nFor the remaining studies, the results of those \ntraining interventions that aimed to increase staff \nknowledge were consistently positive.256,257,259 All \nfour studies used a full range of study designs, \nfrom a RCT to a retrospective case\u2013control study. \nWhere staff knowledge was measured, significant \nimprovements were found in two instances. \nImproved knowledge was also reported in \nconjunction with greater patient satisfaction by \none study,258 but in another study, with a superior \ndesign, the combination of improved knowledge \nand improved patient satisfaction was not found.256 \nThe latter was a RCT.\nFive studies found that training led to a significant \nreduction in mortality rates. This was the case not \nonly for studies using the prospective cohort and \nretrospective case\u2013control research designs,254,259,379 \nbut also for high-quality longitudinal designs, such \nas RCTs370 and quasi-experimental designs.371 Two \nstudies examined length of stay as an outcome, \nwith differing results. The more powerful quasi-\nexperimental study found that the training \nintervention had a positive effect on length of \nstay,371 whereas the more limited prospective \ncohort design of Lawrence et al.379 found no such \npositive outcome. However, the interventions and \npopulations of the two studies were different.\nOmissions\nSeveral staff outcomes were measured by \nthese studies, but no study controlled for any \nstaff variables and none examined these staff \npsychological or behavioural variables as \nmoderators or mediators of the relationships \nbeing evaluated. Unlike many other studies of \nHRM practices in the health sector, there are \nno longitudinal studies here looking at whether \ntraining or education can have an impact on \nwaiting times or patient safety indicators other \nthan infection rates.\nSummary\nThe training interventions considered here have \ncertain basic elements in common, but they also \ndiffer in elements of their content and delivery. \nThe training ranged from leaflets to formal lectures \nand seminars. The primary outcomes examined by \nmost of these studies were also different.\nA group of seven studies all examined the impact \nof some form of infection control training on \ninfection rates, and six of these studies found \nthat training significantly reduced infection rates. \nHowever, none of these studies used a high-quality, \npowerful form of longitudinal study design.\nSeveral studies also found that training had a \npositive effect on staff knowledge and mortality \nrates. These studies not only used simple \nprospective and retrospective designs, but also \nsuperior longitudinal study designs, such as RCTs \nand quasi-experimental design. The effect of \ntraining from those studies is, overall, positive.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

A narrative \nsynthesis is preferred because of the very small \nsample of studies identified. However, this topic \nhas been the subject of seven systematic reviews. \nFive of these reviews have compared the impact \nof different types of remuneration for physicians \non a range of patient and service outcomes.382\u2013386 \nThe remaining reviews consider the impact of \ntarget payments on immunisation rates and \nfinancial incentives on retention rates among rural \nphysicians.387\u2013388 No health professionals other than \nphysicians have been considered by these reviews. \nNone of the studies described below appears in \nany of these systematic reviews. There are also five \nreviews focusing on compensation and rewards in \nthe non-health sector, such as financial rewards, \nsocial rewards and profit sharing.367,389\u2013392\nDetails of studies\nThree studies met the inclusion criteria (Table \n36). All studies were published in English, with \nthe earliest being published in 1999. One study \nwas a good quality prospective design undertaken \nin Sweden, and two studies were retrospective in \ndesign and were conducted in North America. \nThe duration of the studies ranged from 24 to \n48 months. The sample sizes ranged from 418 \nphysicians, or 582 to 6749 patients. Two studies \nwere undertaken in primary care practices, and one \nin hospitals.393\nHRM practice\nThe studies examined different interventions. One \nstudy compared salary with fee for service (FFS) for \nprimary care physicians; one evaluated the impact \nof bonuses on the number of referrals by primary \ncare physicians to colorectal cancer screening, and \none examined a broad incentive, performance-\nbased reimbursement. Like all financial \ninterventions examined by the review literature, \nthese interventions were aimed only at physicians. \nNone of these studies evaluated whether the \nstated intervention was being implemented in full \naccordance with policy.\nOutcomes\nThe outcomes examined by the three studies \nvaried. The first study examined the intervention\u2019s \nimpact on multiple outcomes: mortality and length \nof stay, and a service delivery outcome. The second \nstudy only examined numbers of patients referred \nfor screening. The third, like the first, examined \nlength of stay, but also measured physician-\nperceived quality of care, and physicians\u2019 cost \nawareness as a result of the intervention.\nResults\nThe findings of the study on performance-based \nreimbursement were mixed: length of stay and \nphysicians\u2019 cost awareness improved, but quality \nof care worsened.393 The results of the two \nretrospective studies were similarly inconsistent. In \nthe first case, the different payment systems, fee or \nsalary, had no effect on the measured outcomes,394 \nwhich included mortality and length of stay, but the \nsecond study did find that bonuses increased the \nlikelihood of referral.395\nOmissions\nThese studies examine only three types of \npayment system or financial incentive; others, \nsuch as personal performance-related pay, merit \npay or gain-sharing schemes, were not evaluated. \nThere were no studies of acute care wards, units \nor departments. Also, due to the small number \nof studies, many patient outcomes have not \nbeen examined in relation to this intervention, \nsuch as waiting times, patient satisfaction and \npatient safety. The only staff outcome measured \nby any of these studies was cost awareness; no \nstudy controlled for any staff variables and none \nexamined staff psychological or behavioural \nvariables as moderators or mediators of the \nrelationships being evaluated.\nSummary\nThe studies identified for this review considered \nseveral different compensation and reward \ninterventions and three sets of very different \noutcomes. The literature examining the causal \nrelationship between compensation and rewards \nand various patient outcomes is, therefore, \nextremely limited. These studies suggest that the \nmethod of payment to physicians does not always \npositively affect the small number of patient \noutcomes examined, but bonuses may affect certain \nother outcomes. However, the very small number \nand heterogeneity of the studies prevents any firm \nconclusions from being drawn.\nEmployee involvement\nAll of these studies consider interventions or \npractices that seek to involve staff in decision-\nmaking. The absence of any systematic review or \nmeta-analysis of studies of this intervention in \nthe health sector may be explained by difficulties \nin operationalising the concept of employee \ninvolvement for the purposes of systematic review. \nThe impact of HRM practices in the health sector\n120 TA\nB\nLE\n 3\n6 \nPa\ny\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, d\nur\nat\nio\nn\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nFo\nrs\nbe\nrg\n e\nt a\nl. \n \n(2\n00\n1)\n39\n3\nSw\ned\nen\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nco\nho\nrt\n w\nith\n \nco\nnc\nur\nre\nnt\n \nco\nnt\nro\nls\n41\n8 \nph\nys\nic\nia\nns\n4 \nye\nar\ns\nPe\nrf\nor\nm\nan\nce\n-b\nas\ned\n \nre\nim\nbu\nrs\nem\nen\nt\nN\no\nQ\nua\nlit\ny \nof\n c\nar\ne;\n le\nng\nth\n \nof\n s\nta\ny;\n jo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn \nco\nst\n a\nw\nar\nen\nes\ns\nO\nw\nn \nin\nde\nx;\n h\nos\npi\nta\nl \nre\ngi\nst\ner\nO\nw\nn \nqu\nes\ntio\nnn\nai\nre\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nLe\nng\nth\n o\nf s\nta\ny;\n c\nos\nt \naw\nar\nen\nes\ns\nN\neg\nat\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nQ\nua\nlit\ny \nof\n c\nar\ne\nA\nrm\nou\nr \net\n a\nl. \n(2\n00\n4)\n39\n5\nU\nSA\nRe\ntr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne\n67\n49\n p\nat\nie\nnt\ns\n24\n m\non\nth\ns\nIn\nflu\nen\nce\n o\nf b\non\nus\nes\n o\nn \nC\nol\nor\nec\nta\nl C\nan\nce\nr \nSc\nre\nen\nin\ng\nN\no\nIn\ncr\nea\nse\nd \nch\nan\nce\n o\nf \nre\nfe\nrr\nin\ng \npa\ntie\nnt\n fo\nr \nco\nlo\nre\nct\nal\n c\nan\nce\nr \nsc\nre\nen\nin\ng\nIn\ncr\nea\nse\nd \nch\nan\nce\n o\nf \nre\nfe\nrr\nin\ng \npa\ntie\nnt\n fo\nr \nco\nlo\nre\nct\nal\n c\nan\nce\nr \nsc\nre\nen\nin\ng:\n R\nou\ntin\ne \nda\nta\n \nco\nlle\nct\nio\nn\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt: \nBo\nnu\ns \nel\nig\nib\nili\nty\n \nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nly\n a\nss\noc\nia\nte\nd \nw\nit\nh \nph\nys\nic\nia\nns\n a\nsk\nin\ng \nfo\nr \nm\nor\ne \nco\nlo\nre\nct\nal\n s\ncr\nee\nni\nng\n t\nes\nts\n fo\nr \npa\ntie\nnt\ns\nLe\ne \net\n a\nl. \n(1\n99\n9)\n39\n4\nC\nan\nad\na\nRe\ntr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne\n58\n2 \npa\ntie\nnt\ns\n3 \nye\nar\ns\nPr\nim\nar\ny \nca\nre\n p\nhy\nsi\nci\nan\n \npa\nym\nen\nt: \nSa\nla\nry\n v\ns \nFF\nS\nN\no\nN\num\nbe\nr \nan\nd \nco\nst\n o\nf \nsp\nec\nia\nlis\nt \ndi\nag\nno\nst\nic\n \nse\nrv\nic\nes\n a\nnd\n m\ned\nic\nin\nes\nN\no.\n o\nf d\nay\ns \nin\n h\nos\npi\nta\nl\nC\nau\nse\ns \nof\n d\nea\nth\nN\num\nbe\nr \nan\nd \nco\nst\n o\nf \nsp\nec\nia\nlis\nt \ndi\nag\nno\nst\nic\n \nse\nrv\nic\nes\n a\nnd\n m\ned\nic\nin\nes\n: \nRo\nut\nin\ne \nda\nta\n c\nol\nle\nct\nio\nn\nN\no.\n o\nf d\nay\ns \nin\n h\nos\npi\nta\nl: \nRo\nut\nin\ne \nda\nta\n c\nol\nle\nct\nio\nn\nC\nau\nse\ns \nof\n d\nea\nth\n: R\nou\ntin\ne \nda\nta\n c\nol\nle\nct\nio\nn\nN\no \nef\nfe\nct\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Tellingly, there \nare also no distinct meta-analyses of employee \ninvolvement in the HRM literature of the non-\nhealth sector.\nDetails of studies\nFive studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 37). \nThree studies were published in English and two in \nGerman. The earliest was published in 1999. Two \nstudies were conducted in the USA and three in \nGermany. All of the studies in this sample used a \nprospective design. The studies varied in duration, \nfrom 6 months to 5 years. The sample sizes ranged \nfrom 97 to 826 patients. However, in one study \nthe sample size was not given. In all but one case, \nthe studies focused on a similar unit of analysis, \neither an ICU or an equivalent ward or medical \ndepartment.\nHRM practice\nThese five studies all examined quality circles or \nan equivalent body, such as a continuing quality \nimprovement committee. In four cases this was \nthe only intervention and, in the fifth, quality \ncircles constituted one component of a broader \nquality management system. All but one of the \ninterventions was aimed at both physicians and \nnurses. These studies have much in common with \nthe research examining performance management \ninterventions because three of the five monitor or \nmeasure compliance with designated practices. In \none study, the specific function of the quality circle \nwas to monitor implementation and pursue actions \nto improve it.396\nOutcomes\nWith the exception of mortality and length of stay, \nwhich were considered by two papers, the outcomes \nconsidered by the five studies of quality circles \nwere all different, and ranged from co-worker \nsatisfaction to treatment outcomes such as patient \ncomplications.\nResults\nThese quality circles consistently led to significant \npositive outcomes in four of the five studies.396\u2013399 \nIn the other study, the intervention had no \nsignificant effect on the majority of the outcomes \nand a small positive effect on one only: satisfaction \nwith service provided by the receptionist.261 All \nof the studies used a prospective cohort design, \nmostly with historical controls, so there is nothing \nto choose between them in terms of study \nmethodology.\nOmissions\nNone of the studies reported here took primary \nor community care practices as its unit of analysis \nand only one staff outcome was measured by any \nof these studies. No study controlled for any staff \nvariables and none examined staff psychological or \nbehavioural variables as moderators or mediators \nof the relationships being evaluated. Waiting times \nwas the only principal patient care outcome not \nconsidered by one or more of these studies.\nSummary\nThere is a distinct grouping of employee \ninvolvement studies in the longitudinal literature \nrelating to the health sector: quality circles. This \nintervention was found to have a consistently \nsignificant and positive effect on a range of \ndifferent patient outcomes.\nPerformance management\nAll of these studies consider interventions or \npractices that evaluate and feed back on the \nperformance of health professionals. A narrative \nsynthesis is preferred here despite the homogeneity \nof some clusters of studies in this sample. No \nsystematic reviews of performance management \nin the health sector were found, but there are \nseveral meta-analyses of performance management \nin the non-health sector HRM literature. These \ncover feedback,400,401 goal setting401 and supervisor \nratings.402,403\nDetails of studies\nSeven studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 38). \nAll of the studies were published in English, with \nthe earliest being published in 1991. Four studies \nwere conducted in the USA, two in Argentina \nand one in Taiwan. All studies used prospective \ndesigns. The studies varied in duration, from \n12 months to 5 years. The sample sizes ranged \nfrom 300 physicians or 800 to 1411 patients, with \nthe sample population being determined by the \nstudy outcome. However, in three cases the sample \nsize was not given. All of the studies focused on \na similar unit of analysis, either an ICU or an \nequivalent ward or medical department.\nHRM practice\nThe seven studies all examined feedback.

This \nis the only study of this type.\nThese studies are unusual because only one \ndoes not measure compliance with the practices \ndescribed by the educational component of the \nintervention. The majority, therefore, seek to \nmeasure the fidelity with which at least part of the \nintervention or practice is being implemented. \nThis is because this monitoring or surveillance \nis also part of the intervention: the feedback \ncomponent is informed by the measurement of \ncompliance. This is not a requirement for most \nHRM interventions.\nOutcomes\nIn all cases, these studies measure only a single \noutcome. Six of the seven studies all examine in-\nhospital infection rates.373\u2013376,406,407 However, only \ntwo studies examine the same type of infection, \ncatheter-related UTIs.374,406 The types of infection \nstudied by the remaining papers are all different, \nalthough measurement rates are usually the same \nor very similar. The one study that looks at a \ndifferent outcome examined patient satisfaction.408\nResults\nIn all cases, the interventions were found to have a \nsignificant positive impact on infection rates. All of \nthese studies used a prospective cohort design with \nhistorical controls.\nOmissions\nThese studies only focused on the performance \nmanagement practice of feedback; other practices \nsuch as staff appraisals and goal setting were not \nevaluated. None of the studies were in emergency \ndepartments, primary or community care, or \nthe local hospital. Also, other possible patient \noutcomes have not been considered by the research \nin relation to this type of HRM intervention or \npractice, such as waiting times, mortality and \nlength of stay, as well as patient safety indicators \nother than nosocomial infection rates. No staff \noutcome was measured by any of these studies, \nno study controlled for any staff variables, and \nnone examined staff psychological or behavioural \nvariables as moderators or mediators of the \nrelationships being evaluated.\nSummary\nThe interventions and outcomes considered by \nthese studies were quite homogeneous and, even \nthough the number of outcomes researched in \nrelation to this intervention was extremely limited, \nthis sample does suggest that the practice of \nfeedback, both alone and in conjunction with \neducation or instruction, can have a significant \npositive effect on infection rates, as well as patient \nsatisfaction.\nConclusions\nLongitudinal studies identified by the broad \nHRM and patient care outcomes literature search \nconducted for this review focus on a small number \nof distinct HRM practices.\nThese are:\n\u2022\t work design\n\u2022\t staffing\n\u2022\t compensation and rewards\n\u2022\t training\n\u2022\t employee involvement\n\u2022\t performance management.\nPractices relating to staffing, especially the \nintroduction, substitution or transfer of staff, as \nwell as staff\u2013patient ratios and working hours, \naccount for more than one-half of the retrieved \nlongitudinal studies of HRM and patient outcomes \nin the health sector. The systematic review and \nmeta-analysis literature on the health sector reflects \nthis balance, with the vast majority of such reviews \nexamining research covering these practices.\nThere are several possible reasons for this focus on \nstaffing and hours.

Instead, \nit focuses principally on practices that are covered \nmuch less by literature on the health sector, such as \nemployee involvement391,401,409 and recruitment and \nselection.281,410,411 This review found only a small \nnumber of longitudinal studies looking at quality \ncircles (employee involvement) in relation to \npatient outcomes. HRM practices or interventions \nrelating to communication, family friendly working \nand harmonisation are other major categories \nfor which no longitudinal studies from the health \nsector were identified by this review.\nThere is a great deal of heterogeneity among \nthe studies reviewed in all of the categories. For \nexample, the studies placed within the categories \nof pay, employee involvement and training are \nall very different in terms of both practices and \noutcomes, and this prevents anything but the \nmost basic narrative synthesis. There is a greater \ndegree of homogeneity among the studies under \nthe categories of work design, performance \nmanagement and staffing. Within these categories, \nsome of the studies examine the same or very \nsimilar practices and may be grouped together. \nOnce again, this probably reflects the greater \ninterest among health sector researchers in a small \nnumber of practices relating to staff skill mix \nand working hours. In some cases, these small \ngroupings also measure the same outcomes (albeit \nrarely using the same or equivalent measures). \nHowever, with the exception of practices relating \nto skill enhancement, or the skill mix variables \ninvolving the introduction or substitution of staff, \nthe number of studies contained in these groupings \nis often small, rarely larger than four or five. There \nare also often differences between these studies in \nterms of location, unit of analysis and study length. \nSuch heterogeneity precludes the pooling of data \nfor quantitative synthesis and means we must add \na strong caveat to the drawing of conclusions from \nany narrative synthesis of these studies.\nInterestingly, almost all of the studies identified \nin this review report neither negative nor adverse \neffects for any of the practices evaluated, which \nmay suggest a degree of publication bias affecting \nthe results. The interventions that appear to report \nthe most consistent positive impact on patient \nand staff outcomes are training, performance \nmanagement (feedback) and employee \ninvolvement (quality circles). Beneficial effects were \nfound on infection rates, mortality, length of stay, \npatient satisfaction and staff knowledge. The many \nwork design variables, such as the substitution or \nintroduction of staff, skill enhancement, reduced \nworking hours and the relocation of staff or \nservices, produced more inconsistent results. In \nsome studies these interventions had no effect (or \nno adverse effect), and only in a few cases were \nthe effects positive, such as for the addition of new \nnurses or physicians.\n\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The findings address research \nquestions under Objectives 5 and 6 of the review, \nspecifically:\n\u2022\t Objective 5: 5.1 What is the evidence for the \nimpact of HRM practices on the intermediate \noutcomes identified for this review?\n\u2022\t Objective 6: 6.1 Which HRM practices have an \nimpact on performance outcomes?\nThis chapter gives details of the aspects of the \nreview methodology specific to this review. \nNarrative syntheses for each of the HRM categories \nand data tables are then presented.\nReview methodology\nThe broad approach to systematic review \nmethodology adopted to identify the evidence \npresented in Chapters 6\u20138 is described in Chapter \n2. This section describes aspects of the review \nmethodology specific to this search.\nProtocol development\nSimple protocols were developed to guide the \nsearch, although some parameters were left open \ndue to the lack of consistent definition\/use of \nHRM terms in the literature. The population for \nthe searches was identified as working adults and \nthe intervention was determined as any HRM or \npersonnel management practice. No comparison \nwas specified, but a longitudinal filter was \ndeveloped and used in the search. This ensured \nthat the search was focused on causal relationships. \nNo specific outcomes were stipulated.\nThe data extraction and synthesis was left open \nat this stage to allow development of a synthesis \nframework most fitting to the data retrieved. This \napproach is consistent with the latest developments \nin applying systematic review methodology to \ncomplex literatures.52,56,58,60,63\nSearch strategy\nLiterature search strategies were developed \nand performed on Business Source Premier \nand PsycINFO; these two electronic databases \nhave the most comprehensive coverage of peer-\nreviewed journals in the field of psychology and \nmanagement. Search strings were modified for the \ndifferent databases to take account of the different \nkeywords and thesauri they use. Examples of \nthe search filters and strategies can be found in \nAppendix 8.\nThe searching of electronic databases using pre-\ndesigned search filters was supplemented by \nreference tracking of selected studies. The titles, \nabstracts and full papers of studies identified by \nboth electronic database searching and reference \ntracking were sifted using the following inclusion \ncriteria.\nStudy selection\nSift criteria were developed by the team and \npiloted on a sample of titles and abstracts. \nAdjustments were made to improve specificity, and \nall titles and abstracts identified by the electronic \nsearches and reference tracking were sifted by one \nteam member, with 50% being sifted by a second \nreviewer. The inter-rater reliability, using k-statistic, \nfor the double-sifted articles was 0.92.\nUnclear articles went to another team member for \na second opinion. If still unclear, the full paper was \nretrieved for sifting.\nThe criteria identified papers as relevant to the \nreview on the basis that they:\n\u2022\t were longitudinal in design\n\u2022\t included an intervention which could be \ndescribed as some form of HRM practice, and\n\u2022\t evaluated the intervention on some form of \noutcome measure.\nStudies were excluded if they were unpublished \ntheses.\nThis not only acknowledged potential difficulties \nin obtaining these materials, but also, more \nChapter 8  \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n130\nimportantly, recognised that as these are not \nsubject to peer review prior to publication they \nare likely to be small-scale and of generally poorer \nquality than those conducted by research teams.\nData extraction\nA data extraction form was developed by the team \nand piloted on a sample of papers. Due to the \nheterogeneity of the literature the form focused \non key data [e.g. study design, HRM practice, \nfidelity measure, outcome(s), specific outcome(s) \nmeasure(s)] and any additional references to be \nincluded in the sifting process. Data extraction was \nthen completed by one reviewer. The first round \nof data extraction allowed the team to build a \nclear overview of the evidence base and assess its \nsuitability for synthesis.\nData synthesis\nAs anticipated, there was much heterogeneity \nacross the studies. However, it was concluded that \nnarrative synthesis could be performed for most \nof the broad categories of HRM identified in \nChapter 3. In some cases, the studies identified in a \ncategory clearly fell into distinct subthemes. Where \nthis was the case, syntheses were performed on the \nsmaller, more homogeneous group of studies.\nThe broad categories of HRM and subthemes are \npresented in Table 39.\nFurther data extraction was undertaken to support \nthis synthesis including: sample size; study \nduration; moderators or mediators; and results.\nPapers included in the review were assigned \ndifferent categories based on the HRM practices \nthat they investigated. Some papers have \nresearched on more than one HRM practice \nand therefore such studies occur across different \ncategories. Outcomes in these papers are both \nintermediate and final outcomes.\nResults\nA total of 1622 citations were identified from \nsearches of electronic databases after de-\nduplication. Following screening for relevance, \n1374 citations were rejected on the basis that they \ndid not meet the sift criteria. Full papers were \nobtained for the remaining 248 citations. These \n248 full papers were again subjected to inclusion \ncriteria by three reviewers, which led to a further \nrejection of 119 papers. Data was extracted from \nthe remaining 129 papers and these papers were \nalso scanned for any potentially relevant references. \nThis process of reference tracking led to the \nidentification of 105 more papers of which 70 \nwere rejected as they failed to meet the inclusion \ncriteria. Data was extracted from the remaining 35 \nresearch papers and added to the data obtained \nfrom the 129 papers obtained through electronic \ndatabase searches. Thus, the final synthesis is based \non these 164 research papers.\nTable 39 provides a summary of the studies \nincluded in the review. The QUOROM flow chart280 \nin Figure 4 explains how many studies were rejected \nand at which stage, and the means by which \nincluded studies were identified.\nTABLE 39 HRM categories and subclusters of studies in the \nnon-health literature\nHRM category No. of studies\n1 Work design:\nTeamwork\nJob complexity\nJob demands and control\nJob rotation, enlargement and \nenrichment\nRole conflict\/clarity\n52\n2 Staffing:\nRecruitment\/selection\nSocialisation\nWorking schedule\n23\n3 Training and development:\nPerformance and skill \nenhancement training\nCareer or employee \ndevelopment training\nCultural sensitivity training\nSocialisation training to \nunderstand organisational \nculture\nTQM training\n25\n4 Compensation and rewards 29\n5 Communication 5\n6 Family friendly 9\n7 Single status\/status \nharmonisation\/status differential\n0\n8 Employee representation\/\ninvolvement\/participation\n8\n9 Appraisal\/performance \nmanagement\n25\n10 Bundles\/HPWPs 10\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The studies \nfell into distinct, heterogeneous clusters and \nsyntheses under work design are presented as \nfollows:\n\u2022\t teamwork\n\u2022\t job complexity\n\u2022\t job demands and control\n\u2022\t job rotation, enlargement and enrichment\n\u2022\t role conflict\/clarity.\nTeamwork\nStudies on teamwork largely look at how \nautonomous or semi-autonomous teams can \nhave a significant impact on certain work-related \noutcomes. Autonomous teamwork approaches \npropose that increases in work factors (e.g. variety, \nidentity, significance, autonomy and feedback) are \ncausally linked to work-related outcomes, such as \nmotivation, job satisfaction and productivity. It \nis conceptually similar to the job characteristics \napproach to job design proposed by Hackman and \nOldham.412 The difference in the two approaches \nis the level at which the concepts of variety, \nidentity, significance, autonomy and feedback are \napplied. The job characteristic model proposes the \napplication of these principles at the individual \nwork level; the autonomous teamwork model tries \nto implement the same variables at a group or team \nlevel in a bid to influence work-related outcomes.\nDetails of studies\nEight studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 40). \nAll the studies were published in English, with \nthree conducted in UK, two each in Australia and \nCanada, and one in USA.

The most frequently studied type of \noutcome variable in relation to teamwork was some \nform of performance measure (e.g. individual\/team \nperformance, quality or productivity), with five of \nthe eight studies investigating at least one of these.\nAll other outcome variables in the studies included \nhere were employee centric, such as motivation, job \nsatisfaction, organisational commitment, employee \nturnover, absenteeism, morale, change in employee \nattitude and mental health.\nJob satisfaction was the most studied employee-\ncentric outcome, with five of the eight studies \nmeasuring how it changed with the implementation \nof one form of teamwork or another. Job turnover \nwas the next most commonly studied outcome, with \nfour studies investigating it as an outcome of group \nwork. Other variables were studied by one or two \npapers.\nResults\nThere was some support for improved team and \nindividual performance under autonomous or \nsemi-autonomous teamwork, with two out of three \nstudies arriving at this conclusion.413,414 One study \nfailed to find any such significant relationship.415 \nBoth quality and labour productivity were also \nfound to have improved as a result of introducing \nhigh-performance work teams, characterised \nby decision-making authority, mandated team \nmembership, and an expanded, information rich, \nproblem-solving domain.416,417\nThere was very strong support for the positive \nimpact of work teams on job satisfaction, with all \nfive studies coming to this conclusion.413\u2013415,418\nFive studies investigated the impact of work teams \non job turnover and the results were equivocal, \nwith three studies finding support for the positive \nimpact of team working on job turnover,413,416,419 \nwhereas two other studies found team working to \nhave a negative impact on employee turnover.415,418 \nKirchmeyer419 found that a better work group \nfit had a positive impact on organisational \ncommitment and led to reduced turnover, whereas \ndissimilarity in terms of age, education and lifestyle \nled to poor integration with the work group, which, \nin turn, led to poor organisational commitment \nand high job turnover. A similar finding was \nreported for the link between organisational \ncommitment and work teams, with employees \nshowing high commitment if they worked in teams \nwith similar demographics.419\nMixed results were found for the relationship \nbetween team working and absenteeism. One \nstudy found work teams to exert a positive impact \non absenteeism,416 but the study by Cordery et \nal.418 found a negative impact of teamwork on \nabsenteeism.\nOmissions\nThe longitudinal studies on work teams largely \nconcentrated on performance outcomes or \nemployee-centric outcomes. There were virtually \nno longitudinal studies that investigated how, or \nif, team working can lead to learning outcomes for \nemployees. There are also no longitudinal studies \nincluded here that explore the impact of working \nin teams on the financial bottom line of a firm or \nbusiness unit.\nSummary\nThere were eight studies on teamwork and its \nimpact on various work-related outcomes, with \none-half of the papers concentrating on semi-\nautonomous or autonomous teams. Most of these \nstudies have explored the impact of autonomous \nteam working on performance, quality or \nproductivity issues. Almost all the studies found \nthese two variables to be positively linked.\nThe relationships of work teams with job turnover \nand absenteeism were not so straightforward. Some \nstudies found teamwork to have a positive impact \non both factors, whereas others found them to \nhave a negative impact. There was some evidence \nof this relationship being moderated by group and \ndemographic fit.\nThe studies in this area mostly focused on \nperformance and employee-centric outcomes and \nthere were no longitudinal studies investigating the \nimpact of work groups on learning and growth of \nemployees.\nJob\/task complexity\nStudies of job\/task complexity focused on two \naspects of complexity:\n\u2022\t Psychological complexity refers to the \npsychological dimensions of tasks, for example \nvariety and perceived job scope. It is a more \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n136\nsubjective measure of job complexity and \nhas been measured using tools such as the \nJDS developed by Hackman and Oldham.195 \nSuch an approach to job\/task complexity has \noften been equated with the concept of job \nenrichment.427\n\u2022\t Task\u2013person job complexity refers to tasks \nthat can be objectively classified as simple or \ncomplex, based on the mental demands that a \ngiven job places on the person and the extent \nof education, skill or training required on the \npart of the person to do that job.428\nDetails of studies\nThree studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 41). \nAll of the studies were published in English, with \ntwo being conducted in the USA and the one in \nFinland. The first study was quasi-experimental, \nwith retrospective analysis of the impact of \ncertain HRM practices on the given outcome. \nThe remaining two studies used a prospective \nlongitudinal design. The quasi-experimental study \nwas conducted over 10 years, whereas the other \ntwo studies were conducted over 7 and 4 years, \nrespectively. The sample sizes of the three studies \nwere 174, 110 and 672 employees, respectively.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nThe three studies in this synthesis had distinct \nconcepts of job\/task complexity. However, the \nstudies can be broadly classified as using either \npsychological or task\u2013person complexity as \na variable in their investigations. One study \nexamined only task\u2013person complexity, one study \nused only psychological complexity, and one study \nlooked at both task\u2013person and psychological \ncomplexity.\nIn the first study, by Kalimo et al.429 psychological \ntask complexity was studied as one of the many \nvariables, measured using the Occupational \nStress Questionnaire (OSQ).430 This study used \npersonal resources (sense of coherence, self-esteem \nand sense of competence) as moderators of the \nimpact of task complexity and other predictors on \nemployee burnout.\nThe second study, by Schaubroeck et al.,428 \ninvestigated the impact of both psychological task \nand task\u2013person complexity, as moderated by the \nimpact of an individual\u2019s personality (type A or \ntype B) on his\/her cardiovascular health. The third \nstudy in this analysis, Blau,236 investigated the \nimpact of task complexity \u2013 varying on a scale from \nroutine or simple tasks to complex tasks \u2013 on job \nsatisfaction. Other than task complexity, this study \nalso included wages and performance appraisal \nsatisfaction as predictors for the given outcome.\nOutcomes\nAll three studies used different employee-centric \noutcomes, for example employee burnout, \nemployee cardiovascular health, and employee job \nsatisfaction, as dependent variables.\nResults\nNone of the three studies investigated the impact \nof job\/task complexity directly. The studies all \nexamined the interaction of job\/task complexity \nwith other variables, or study job\/task complexity as \na moderator in the analysis.\nThe studies by Kalimo et al.429 and Schaubroeck et \nal.428 concluded that the impact of job complexity \nwas moderated by, or interacted with, the personal \nresources and personality type of an individual to \ndetermine how it would impact on an individual\u2019s \nhealth. The study by Kalimo et al.429 found that \nhigher job complexity was associated with lower \nburnout. The other variables that helped prevent \nburnout were appreciation of work, feedback \nand role clarity. They concluded that sense of \ncoherence (SOC) was the most important personal \ndeterminant of burnout and individuals with high \nSOC were significantly more resistant to burnout \nthan those with low SOC. Schaubroeck et al.428 \nfound that job complexity (both types) interacted \nwith employee personality type (types A and B) to \nimpact on cardiovascular health. They concluded \nthat high job complexity for type B individuals \nleads to low cardiovascular disorders, whereas high \njob complexity for type A individuals leads to high \ncardiovascular disorders.\nThe study by Blau236 used task responsibility as a \nconstruct and measured it as a continuum ranging \nfrom routine to complex tasks. He concluded that \ntask complexity was significantly positively related \nto job satisfaction. Besides task complexity, he \nfound both higher wages and satisfaction with \nsupervisory performance appraisal to be significant \ndeterminants of employee job satisfaction.\nOmissions\nAll studies have focused on employee-centric \nhealth-related outcomes, for example burnout \nand cardiovascular health, or on psychological \noutcomes, such as job satisfaction.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Control has been studied as decision \ncontrol, skill discretion, degree of autonomy and \npredictability.\nDetails of studies\nThirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (Table \n42). All of the studies were published in English. \nFive were conducted in the Netherlands, four in \nthe UK, two in Denmark and one each in Sweden \nand Hong Kong. Five of the 13 studies had a \nquasi-experimental design and the remaining \neight studies were of prospective longitudinal \ndesign. The majority of studies (8 out of 13) were \nconducted over a 12-month period or less. The \nshortest time duration for a study was just 1 month, \nwhereas the longest was carried out over 5 years. \nSample size varied from 144 to 11,799 employees.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nAll of the studies in this section investigated the \nimpact of work demands and individual levels \nof control. The majority of studies (8 out of 13) \nmeasured some form of social support at work \nas a potential moderator of the demand\u2013control \nrelationship. Locus of control (LOC)\/personality \nwas used as moderator by two studies, and one \nstudy each used work values (traditional versus \nmodern) and extent of predictability (being \ninformed of future events at work) as moderating \nvariables.\nOutcomes\nAll 13 studies have used employee-centric \noutcomes (e.g. job satisfaction, absenteeism, \nturnover and work motivation) as dependent \nvariables. The majority of studies also measured \nemployee health-related outcomes, including \nmental health, occupational stress, psychological \nwell-being, self-rated health, perceived strain, \nemotional exhaustion, anxiety, depression, immune \nfunctions and cardiovascular health.\nJob satisfaction was the most frequently studied \noutcome, with five studies investigating how \ndemands and control have an impact on employee \njob or work satisfaction.\nTwo studies investigated the impact of demands \nand control on employee learning outcomes, such \nas skill utilisation, self-efficacy and motivation to \nlearn.\nResults\nThe studies on job demands and control have used \nKarasek\u2019s433 demand\u2013control model as a starting \npoint to investigate how various combinations of \ndemand and control impact on given outcomes.\nOf the five studies that investigated the impacts \nof demands and control on job satisfaction, two \nconcluded that high demands and low control lead \nto poor job satisfaction,233,434 two studies found that \nhigh control led to higher job satisfaction,435,436 and \none study failed to find any impact for high control \non job satisfaction.229\nAbsence was another outcome that was found to \nrespond well to high job control. Three studies \nconcluded that high job control leads to lower \nabsence.229,437,438 The study by Smulders and \nNijhuis437 concluded that high job demands, when \ncoupled with high control, can lead to low absence.\nJob turnover was found to be negatively associated \nwith high demands, but high control was not found \nto have any significant relationship with employee \nturnover.229,439\nAll of the health and psychophysiological outcomes \nwere found to be negatively related to high job \ndemands with low control, and to respond well to \nenhanced job control.\nTwo studies that explored the relationship of \ndemands and control on employee learning and \nself-efficacy concluded that increased control leads \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This is reflected in the use of managerial \nsupport or social support measures in eight of the \n13 studies. There was clear evidence in this set of \nstudies for the positive impact of social support on \nall given outcomes when used in conditions of high \njob control.\nOmissions\nThese 13 studies have covered a wide variety of \nhealth and employee-centric outcomes. However, \nthere were no studies exploring how job demands \nand job control, in their various combinations, \ninfluence job performance, productivity or \ncustomer\/client outcomes.\nSummary\nThe results of the 13 studies meeting the criteria \nfor inclusion in this review provided consistent \nevidence for the positive impact of increased job \ncontrol and the negative impact of high demands \non the given outcomes. Job satisfaction, absence \nbehaviour and health outcomes in particular were \npositively influenced by higher control. A large \nproportion of these studies (5 out of 13) were \nquasi-experimental in design. Over one-half of the \nstudies investigated the influence of managerial or \nsocial support as a variable alongside demands and \ncontrol.\nThe studies in this area mostly focused on health \nand employee-centric outcomes and there were \nno longitudinal studies investigating the impact \nof demand and control on performance or \nproductivity.\nJob rotation, enlargement and \nenrichment\nThe concepts of job rotation, enlargement and \nenrichment are all suggested answers to the \nproblems posed by job simplification.\n\u2022\t Job rotation involves doing more than a single \ntype of repetitive task. The inherent logic of \njob rotation is to help break the monotony \narising out of doing the same task repeatedly, \nalso making the employee more versatile as \nhe\/she learns various other tasks. It does not, \nhowever, change the content of the job.453\n\u2022\t Job enlargement is intended to increase \nthe breadth of activities that employees are \nengaged in.454 It refers to horizontal expansion \nof the jobs, increasing the role responsibilities \nand range of activities being carried out by an \nemployee.453\n\u2022\t Job enrichment leads to more holistic changes \nin job roles and responsibilities. In contrast \nwith the horizontal expansion involved in \njob enlargement, job enrichment involves \nvertical expansion.412 An enriched work design \nmeans that employees have discretion to take \non broader and more proactive tasks as and \nwhen required. It can be done by increasing \nemployee responsibility, autonomy and regular \nfeedback.\nDetails of studies\nTwenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria \n(Table 43). All the studies were published in English, \nwith eleven being conducted in USA, three in the \nUK, three in Canada, two in the Netherlands, and \none each in Sweden and Israel. There were four \nstudies with RCT designs, six studies used quasi-\nexperimental methods, and eleven studies had a \nprospective longitudinal research design. There \nwas huge variation in the duration of the studies in \nthis section, with the shortest being just 2 months \nand the longest being 4.5 years. The sample size \nof these 21 studies varied from 31 employees to \n80 manufacturing firms with between 60 and 1150 \nemployees.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nAuthors used the terms job enlargement and \njob enrichment in their own distinct ways. \nCampion and McClelland455 used the terms \u2018task \nenlargement\u2019 and \u2018knowledge enlargement\u2019 as \ntwo types of job enlargement, with knowledge \nenlargement being conceptually similar to \njob enrichment. Therefore, the Campion and \nMcClelland455 study has been included as a study \nof both job enlargement and enrichment. Parker454 \nused job enlargement as horizontal enlargement \nand job enrichment for jobs that were high on \nautonomy and control. Other variations of the \nuse of the term job enrichment included high job \nstimulation, high motivating potential score (MPS), \nhigh authority and control, high job quality, high \njob scope, and high intrinsic motivating properties \nof the job.\nThere were two studies on job rotation: \none analysed the impact of job rotation on \npsychophysiological stress reactions and \nmusculoskeletal symptoms456 and one explored the \nimpact on performance.457\nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n144 TA\nB\nLE\n 4\n3 \nW\nor\nk \nde\nsig\nn \n(jo\nb \nro\nta\ntio\nn,\n e\nnl\nar\nge\nm\nen\nt a\nnd\n e\nnr\nic\nhm\nen\nt)\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, d\nur\nat\nio\nn\nP\nra\nct\nic\ne(\ns)\n\/in\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n);\n \nm\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n (\nif \nan\ny)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nR\nis\nse\nn \net\n a\nl. \n(2\n00\n2)\n45\n6\nSw\ned\nen\nEx\npe\nri\nm\nen\nta\nl \nde\nsi\ngn\n31\n w\nom\nen\n \nem\npl\noy\nee\ns\n3\u2013\n4.\n5 \nye\nar\ns\nPr\nac\ntic\nes\n:\nJo\nb \nro\nta\ntio\nn\nM\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n:\nN\non\ne\nN\no\nPs\nyc\nho\nph\nys\nio\nlo\ngi\nca\nl \nst\nre\nss\n r\nea\nct\nio\nns\n;

It also \nhad a positive impact on muscle activities in the \nneck and shoulder. However, job rotation had no \nimpact on other psychophysiological reactions of \nsystolic blood pressure, heart rate and perceived \nnegative arousal.456 Blocher457 found a lapse in \nperformance over time for audit staff at senior \nlevel if the seniors were assigned consecutively \nwithin a particular industry, whereas no lapse \nin performance was observed for those seniors \nwho rotated between assignments in different \nindustries.\nStudies investigating job enlargement and \nenrichment found a positive impact on RBSE454,458 \nbut a negative impact on workload, i.e. workload \nincreased.455\nKnowledge enlargement was found to have a \npositive relationship with customer services.455\nResearchers investigating the impact of job \nenrichment on various outcomes were unanimous \nin their conclusion that it is a desirable \nintervention, which works quite well for some \noutcomes but has less straightforward results \nfor others.

One would expect \nmore research on these variables given both job \nenlargement and enrichment are conceptually \nproposed to enhance the skills and abilities of \nemployees. However, no longitudinal research \nexplored such tasks.\nSummary\nThe 21 studies in this review investigated \nthe impact of job rotation, enlargement and \nenrichment on various outcomes. There were two \nstudies on job rotation, both of which find it to be \nbeneficial. The three studies on job enlargement \nwere consistent in their conclusion that job \nenlargement by itself has a negative impact on \nemployees. The 16 studies on job enrichment and \nthree on job enrichment and job enlargement \nindicated that job enrichment largely has a positive \nimpact on all the outcomes, especially on job \nsatisfaction, employee motivation, involvement \nand commitment. Some studies also found job \nenrichment to have a positive impact on other \noutcomes, for example, individual performance, \ncustomer service, job turnover or intention to leave, \nand depression. The impact of job enrichment \non absenteeism was found to be positive by two \nstudies but one study failed to find any such link. \nThe role of job enrichment on job turnover or \nintention to quit was clearer, with three out of four \nstudies indicating that enriched jobs lead to lower \njob turnover. One study found job enrichment to \npredict company productivity and profitability.\nOverall, research in this field is dominated by \ninvestigation of the impact of job enrichment. \nThere is comparatively little longitudinal research \non job rotation or job enlargement per se.\nRole ambiguity, role conflict and role \nclarity\nStudies of role conflict and role ambiguity have \ntypically treated these variables as dimensions \nof role stress, focusing on whether, for example, \nincreased levels of role conflict or role ambiguity \nlead to increased role stress and, conversely, \nwhether higher levels of role clarity lead to \ndecreased role stress.\nDetails of studies\nSeven studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 44). \nAll studies were published in English. Four \nwere conducted in the USA and the other three \nwere conducted in the UK, Israel and Finland, \nrespectively. The first six studies used a prospective \nlongitudinal design and the seventh study was \na quasi-experimental study using retrospective \nlongitudinal analysis. Five of the studies in this \ncategory were conducted over a period of 1 year or \nless, one was carried out over 2 years, and one over \na period of 10 years. The sample size of the studies \nvaried from 111 to 661 employees.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nMost studies in this synthesis treated role ambiguity \nas a stressor, with some even labelling it as such. \nBateman and Strasser235 used a measure of role \nconflict and role ambiguity (along with role \noverload) as a measure of job tension, whereas \nSaks and Ashforth482 and Kalimo et al.429 used it \nas a measure of an occupational stressor. None of \nthe seven studies investigated the impact of role \nconflict or role clarity per se. Most of the studies \nconsidered it as one of a range of occupational \nrole characteristics. Three studies investigated role \nconflict or role clarity in conjunction with other key \ncharacteristics of the job, for example the MPS for \nthe job (as measured by JDS) or some components \nof MPS, such as autonomy or task significance. \nOther studies explored the impact of role conflict \nin conjunction with colleagues\u2019 or supervisors\u2019 \nsupport. Though these studies attempted some \nform of statistical control to understand the \nunique effects of role clarity or role ambiguity, \nonly two studies presented moderated analysis of \nrole conflict and role clarity with other variables. \nThe study by Saks and Ashfort482 investigated the \nmoderating role of predispositions in the form of \ngeneral self-efficacy (GSE) on role conflict, whereas \nthe study by Fried et al.483 studied the role of job \nsecurity as a moderator of role clarity.\nOutcomes\nJob satisfaction was the most commonly measured \noutcome variable, used in four out of seven \nstudies. Two studies investigated organisational \ncommitment and two studies used individual \nemployee performance as the predicted variable. \nThe other outcome variables studied in relation \nto role conflict or role clarity were mental health, \nintention to quit, frustration, stress symptoms and \nemployee burnout.\nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n152 TA\nB\nLE\n 4\n4 \nW\nor\nk\u2002\nde\nsi\ngn\n\u2002(r\nol\ne\u2002\nco\nnfl\nic\nt\/\ncl\nar\nity\n)\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, d\nur\nat\nio\nn\nP\nra\nct\nic\ne(\ns)\n\/in\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n);\n \nm\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n (\nif \nan\ny)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nBa\nte\nm\nan\n \nan\nd \nSt\nra\nss\ner\n \n(1\n98\n4)\n23\n5\nU\nSA\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nlo\nng\nitu\ndi\nna\nl\n12\n9 \nem\npl\noy\nee\ns\n5 \nm\non\nth\ns\nPr\nac\ntic\nes\n:\nJo\nb \nte\nns\nio\nn:\n M\nea\nsu\nre\nd \nas\n \nco\nm\npr\nis\nin\ng \nro\nle\n c\non\nfli\nct\n\/a\nm\nbi\ngu\nit\ny\/\nov\ner\nlo\nad\nM\not\niv\nat\nin\ng \npo\nte\nnt\nia\nl s\nco\nre\n: \nM\nea\nsu\nre\nd \nas\n a\n c\num\nul\nat\niv\ne \nsc\nor\ne \nfr\nom\n a\ndm\nin\nis\ntr\nat\nio\nn \nJD\nS\nC\nen\ntr\nal\nis\nat\nio\nn:\n A\n m\nea\nsu\nre\n o\nf \npa\nrt\nic\nip\nat\nio\nn\/\nau\nto\nno\nm\ny \nin\n d\nec\nis\nio\nn-\nm\nak\nin\ng\nM\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n:\nN\non\ne\nN\no\nJo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn \nan\nd \nor\nga\nni\nsa\ntio\nna\nl c\nom\nm\nitm\nen\nt\nJo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn:\n Jo\nb \nD\nes\ncr\nip\ntiv\ne \nIn\nde\nx \n(J\nD\nI;

Saks and Ashforth482 found role conflict to \nbe a significant predictor of poor organisational \ncommitment. In contrast, Bateman and Strasser235 \nfound no significant impact of job tension \n(measured as a combination of role conflict, role \nambiguity and role overload) on organisational \ncommitment. There were also mixed findings in \nrelation to the impact of role conflict on mental \nhealth. Saks and Ashfort482 found a negative impact \nof role conflict, ambiguity and overload on stress \nsymptoms, whereas Moyle435 found no significant \nrelationship between role ambiguity and mental \nhealth.\nThe interaction effect of two moderators of role \nconflict was investigated by two studies, both of \nwhich reported significant findings. Role conflict \ninteracted with GSE such that those with high \nGSE reported higher organisational commitment \nand identification under conditions of high \nrole conflict, whereas the opposite was true for \nindividuals with low GSE.482 Role clarity was \nfound to significantly interact with job security;483 \nincreases in performance were maximised when \nboth role clarity and job security were high, while \ndeterioration in performance was greatest under \nconditions of high job security and low clarity. \nRole clarity was also found to be instrumental in \npreventing job burnout.\nOmissions\nOnly two studies investigated the impact of role \nclarity or role conflict\/ambiguity on variables other \nthan employee-centric outcomes, for example \nindividual job performance. Most of the studies \nonly focused on employee-centric psychological \noutcomes, such as job satisfaction. Outcomes \nincluding the impact of role clarity or role \nambiguity on clients, customer-centric outcomes \nor outcomes related to learning and growth of \nemployees seem to have been largely omitted.\nSummary\nThe seven studies on role conflict\/ambiguity \nor role conflict were fairly homogeneous in \ntheir definitions and use of terminology. Most \nof the studies investigated the impact of role \nconflict or role clarity on employee-centric \npsychological outcomes, with job satisfaction again \nbeing the most studied variable. Overall, the \nstudies concurred that role conflict reduced job \nsatisfaction and increased burnout but its impact \non organisational commitment was unclear. The \nstudies also highlighted that role clarity may \ninteract significantly with some dispositional or \njob environment variables (e.g. self-efficacy or \nworkplace support) to influence key outcome \nvariables. The majority of studies considered \nrole conflict or role clarity in combination with \nother work design variables, especially those that \nconstitute the Hackman and Oldham412 JDS, such \nas task autonomy and task significance.\nStaffing\nTwenty-three papers were categorised under the \nbroad HRM area of staffing. The studies fell into \nthree distinct areas of focus and syntheses are \npresented for each area as follows:\n\u2022\t recruitment and selection\n\u2022\t induction\/orientation\n\u2022\t work scheduling.\nRecruitment\/selection\nEmployee selection is a two-way interaction, where \napplicants and organisations gather information \nabout one another and react to this information \nwhile making employment decisions.495 The \nlongitudinal studies in this section looked at a \nrange of factors in the recruitment and selection \nprocess, and considered how they have an impact \non various employee and organisational outcomes.\nDetails of studies\nSeven studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 45), \nall of which were conducted in the USA. One study \nused experimental design with full randomisation, \ntwo studies used quasi-experimental methods, \nand four had a prospective longitudinal research \ndesign. The duration of the studies varied from \n1 hour to 8 years. The sample size of these seven \nstudies varied from 30 to 533 employees.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n155\nHRM practice\/intervention\nThe HRM practices investigated in these seven \nstudies focus on two broad areas:\n\u2022\t the tools and techniques of employee selection\n\u2022\t the impact of an applicant\u2019s perception of the \nselection process on his\/her decision to accept \nthe employment offer.\nFive of the seven studies examined selection. They \nexplored the usefulness of realistic job previews, \nthe predictive validity of assessment centres, \nperson\u2013organisation fit measures as a selection \ntool, employee referrals as a hiring practice, and \nthe use of weighted application blanks (WABs) for \nscreening potentially successful candidates.\nTwo further studies explored how perceptions \nof procedural justice in the selection process \ncould have important consequences for both the \napplicant and the organisation.\nOutcomes\nOne study496 investigated the effectiveness of a \nrecruitment strategy on employee productivity \nand turnover. Castilla496 looked at the relationship \nbetween the productivity and turnover of \nemployees hired through referrals from current \nemployees, and the productivity and turnover of \nemployees hired without such references. Another \nstudy looked at the predictive validity of the \nscreening process.\nAll other studies investigated the impact of various \nhiring and selection practices on the employee-\ncentric outcomes of turnover, trust and honesty, \nattitudes towards other employees and the \norganisation, commitment, job satisfaction, role \nambiguity, organisational attractiveness, intention \ntowards the organisation, achievements of the \nselected employees later in their career, person\u2013\norganisation fit achieved at a later time, and \nintention to leave.\nResults\nThe five studies that investigated the relationship \nbetween specific recruitment and selection \ntechniques all reported broadly positive impacts of \nthese tools. The study by Meglino et al.497 on army \nrecruits found that trainees exposed to combined \npreviews had significantly lower turnover. Trainees\u2019 \nexposure to combined previews was also found to \nbe positively related to their perceptions of the \narmy as more caring, trustworthy and honest; \nthey were more committed to the army, more \nsatisfied with their jobs, and experienced less \nrole ambiguity. Previews were more effective in \nreducing turnover among more intelligent trainees \nand among those initially more committed to \narmy. These results were based on a randomised \nexperimental design.\nThe other four studies on selection tools and \ntechniques, using prospective longitudinal designs, \nalso reported positive outcomes from the use of \ntheir respective methods.\nManagement assessment centre scores attained \n8 years previously (at the time of recruitment) were \nfound to predict the level or position attained by \nemployees later in their careers.498\nPerson\u2013organisation fit measures, when used as \na selection tool, reliably predicted the person\u2013\norganisation fit of employees 2.5 years after the \nrecruitment process and were positively related to \ntheir job satisfaction. High person\u2013organisation fit \nalso reduced intention to leave the organisation.499\nCastilla496 found that using referrals from existing \nemployees for hiring new workers was an effective \nrecruitment strategy, as workers hired in this way \nwere found to be more productive and to have \nlower turnover than workers hired without such \nreferrals.\nBrowne et al.500 reported that use of WABs \nimproved the screening process used in hiring \npolice recruits. WABs were effective predictors of \nthe successful applicants. However, the authors \ngave no time period over which the study was \ncarried out. Given that the study did not have an \nexperimental design and was carried out over a \nsingle recruitment process, it would require further \nstudies on a similar sample with similar tools to \narrive at any definitive conclusion.\nThe remaining two studies explored how \napplicants\u2019 perceptions of procedural justice of the \nselection process and the treatment they received \nat the test site influenced their attraction toward \nthe organisation and their intention to accept or \nreject the offer.495,501 The study of Bauer et al.495 \nwas conducted on white-collar workers, whereas \nthe study by Maertz et al.501 was conducted on \nblue-collar workers. However, both studies used \nthe same intervention, studied the same outcomes \nand found similar results. They concluded that \napplicants\u2019 perceptions of procedural justice after \nselection tests had been taken but before pass\u2013fail \nfeedback was given, predicted organisational-\nrelated outcomes, but had marginal or no effect on \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n156 TA\nB\nLE\n 4\n5 \nSt\naf\nfin\ng\u2002\n(r\nec\nru\nitm\nen\nt\/\nse\nle\nct\nio\nn)\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, d\nur\nat\nio\nn\nP\nra\nct\nic\ne(\ns)\n\/in\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n);\n \nm\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n (\nif \nan\ny)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nM\neg\nlin\no \net\n \nal\n.

This suggests that test \noutcome favourability (passing or failing) predicts \norganisational outcomes more consistently than do \nperceptions of procedural justice. The studies used \nquasi-experimental design and the findings were \nreplicated across both time and different samples.\nOmissions\nOne study used employee performance \n(productivity) as an outcome measure of the \nrecruitment and selection techniques. All other \nstudies concentrated on employee-centric \noutcomes. As most selection tools and techniques \nare designed for, and aim to, select employees who \nare best suited for a given job, it was expected that \nmore longitudinal studies would be available on \nthis theme. However, this review found a paucity of \nlongitudinal research on such relationships.\nSummary\nThere are seven studies in this review that \ninvestigated how various recruitment and selection \ntechniques impact on a range of employee and \norganisational outcomes. All but one of the studies \nused employee-centric variables as outcomes; only \none study investigated the impact of using referrals \nfrom existing employees on the productivity of new \nemployees. The results from three of these seven \nstudies were particularly strong as they were based \non experimental and quasi-experimental research \ndesigns.\nInduction\/Orientation\nMost organisations provide some form of \ninduction, orientation, or socialisation programme \nto new recruits. These programmes may be \nconducted in various ways, depending on the \nrequirements of the position and the organisation. \nVan Maanen and Schein508 propose that different \nsocialisation tactics produce different results in \nnewcomers\u2019 adjustments to their new roles. They \nidentify six dimensions of socialisation tactics, with \neach dimension consisting of a bipolar continuum: \ncollective\u2013individual, formal\u2013informal, sequential\u2013\nrandom, fixed\u2013variable, serial\u2013disjunctive, and \ninvestiture\u2013divestiture.\nOther authors have used this classification and \nhave proposed different combinations of these six \ndimensions. Jones509 grouped the six dimensions \nin two sets and classified them as \u2018Institutionalized \nsocialisation tactics\u2019 and \u2018Individualized \nsocialisation tactics\u2019. Organisations that scored \nhigh on institutionalised tactics use orientation \nprogrammes that emphasise a collective, formal, \nsequential, fixed, serial and investiture form of \nsocialisation (as opposed to individual, informal, \nrandom, variable, disjunctive and divestiture \nsocialisation, which characterise individualised \nsocialisation tactics).\nDetails of studies\nNine studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 46). \nAll of the studies were published in English. Eight \nstudies were conducted in the USA and one in \nthe UK. Three studies used quasi-experimental \nmethods and six had a prospective longitudinal \nresearch design. Most of the studies were \nconducted over a relatively short duration, with the \nshortest time period being 4 weeks and the longest \nbeing 2 years. The sample size of these studies \nvaried from 61 to 661.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nAll of the studies investigated the benefits of some \nform of induction or orientation programme \nimplemented by various organisations to initiate \ntheir new employees.\nAll but one study510 used the classifications of either \nVan Maanen and Schein508 or Jones,509 as described \nabove. Cooper-Thomas et al.510 investigated \nthe efficacy of a computer-based orientation \nprogramme to impact on later socialisation of \nemployees, their job satisfaction and organisational \ncommitment.\nOutcomes\nAll but one study511 investigated the impact of \nvarious socialisation tactics on employee-centric \noutcomes, including level of later socialisation, job \nsatisfaction, organisational commitment, newcomer \nadjustment, stress, intention to quit, intention to \nremain and achievement of person\u2013organisation \nfit. Ashforth and Saks511 investigated the impact \nof socialisation practices on self-appraised \nperformance.\nResults\nThe results of the studies in this section largely \nsupported the conclusion that socialisation \npractices achieve their intended effects.\n\u2022\t Five studies found a positive impact of \ninstitutionalised socialisation tactics on job \nsatisfaction.499,509\u2013512\n\u2022\t Institutional socialisation tactics were \nalso found to have a positive impact on \norganisational commitment.492,509,510,512,513\n\u2022\t Wesson and Gogus514 found that a computer-\nbased orientation programme had a negative \nimpact on job satisfaction, organisational \ncommitment and levels of later socialisation.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n159\n\u2022\t Studies by Waung,512 Jones509 and Chatman499 \nconcluded that institutionalised socialisation \ntactics had a positive impact on intention \nto remain with the organisation and, thus, \nreduced turnover. However, Waung512 found \nthat providing relevant and potentially \nnegative information about the job during \nthe process of orientation did adversely affect \nsome new recruits, who left the organisation \nin the first few weeks. Those who successfully \ncoped with the initial problems, and who used \nthe help provided during the orientation \nprogramme, were more likely to remain with \nthe organisation.\n\u2022\t Person\u2013organisation fit is another variable that \nis related to socialisation tactics. Three studies \nfound vigorous socialisation, characterised \nby sequential, fixed, serial and investiture \ncharacteristics, leads to better person\u2013\norganisation fit.499,510,515\n\u2022\t Two studies researched the impact of \ninstitutionalised socialisation tactics on \nlater socialisation with other employees \nin the organisation. Both found a positive \nrelationship between the two.493,512 The study \nby Bravo et al.492 found that institutionalised \nsocialisation significantly improved the \nrelationship between new and old employees, \nleading to enhanced role clarity, and had a \npositive impact on workers\u2019 career-enhancing \nstrategies.\n\u2022\t One study511 investigated the impact of \nsocialisation tactics on employee performance \nusing self-rated performance as the dependent \nvariable rather than objective criteria. Ashforth \nand Saks511 found that although individualised \nsocialisation tactics were not related to several \nemployee-centric outcomes, when contrasted \nwith institutionalised socialisation tactics they \ndid have a positive impact on self-perceived \nperformance.\nOmissions\nThe studies on induction and socialisation largely \nconcentrated on employee-centric outcomes. There \nwere no longitudinal studies that researched the \nimpact of socialisation tactics on employee learning \nand growth behaviour. There is also a dearth of \nresearch on the impact of socialisation tactics on \nperformance, with this review finding only one \nstudy based on self-rated employee performance \nthat met the inclusion criteria.\nSummary\nThere are nine studies in this review investigating \nthe impact of various socialisation tactics and \norientation programmes on given outcomes. Most \nof the studies had employee-centric outcomes \n(e.g. job satisfaction, organisational commitment, \nperson\u2013organisation fit, and intention to remain) \nas the predicted variables of these socialisation \npractices. Most of the research in this field \ncentred on the classification of socialisation tactics \nproposed by Van Maanen and Schein508 and \nJones.509 There was overwhelming support for the \npositive impact of institutionalised socialisation \ntactics over individualised tactics on various \nemployee-centric outcomes.\nWork scheduling\nOrganisations use various forms of work scheduling \nto carry out their day to day activities. Some work \nschedules are driven by function, for example \nround-the-clock running of hospitals and factories, \nnecessitating the use of shifts. Other forms of \nwork scheduling are intended to enhance the work \nexperience of employees by, for example, making \na more family friendly environment through HRM \npractices, such as flexitime and compressed work \nweeks.\nDetails of studies\nSix studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 47). Five \nstudies were conducted in the USA and one was \nconducted in the UK. Three studies used quasi-\nexperimental methods, and three had a prospective \nlongitudinal research design. The duration of the \nstudies varied from 2 weeks to 2 years. Sample sizes \nvaried from 68 to 1325 employees.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nAll six studies focused on HRM practices that \ngovern employee work schedules. Practices covered \nin this section were the impact of flexitime, \ncompressed work week, monitoring the time of \nemployees on job, temporary versus permanent \nemployment and perception of procedural justice \nof work schedule on various outcomes.\nOutcomes\nThe various outcomes measured by the studies in \nthis synthesis can be grouped into four categories:\n\u2022\t financial outcomes, including organisational \neffectiveness and overtime costs\n\u2022\t customer or client outcomes, with one study \nresearching quality of client service\n\u2022\t employee performance, for example two \nstudies on work performance and one each on \nproductivity and error rates\n\u2022\t employee outcomes, for example affective \nstates of employees, sickness absence, personal \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n160 TA\nB\nLE\n 4\n6 \nSt\naf\nfin\ng\u2002\n(in\ndu\nct\nio\nn\/\nor\nie\nnt\nat\nio\nn)\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, d\nur\nat\nio\nn\nP\nra\nct\nic\ne(\ns)\n\/in\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n);\n \nm\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n (\nif \nan\ny)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nW\nau\nng\n \n(1\n99\n5)\n51\n2\nU\nSA\nQ\nua\nsi\n-\nex\npe\nri\nm\nen\nta\nl \nde\nsi\ngn\n61\n n\new\n h\nir\nes\n4 \nw\nee\nks\nPr\nac\ntic\nes\n:\nO\nri\nen\nta\ntio\nn \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne \n(e\nxp\ner\nim\nen\nta\nl g\nro\nup\n r\nec\nei\nve\nd \nin\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn \nw\nar\nni\nng\n o\nf n\neg\nat\niv\ne \nas\npe\nct\ns \nof\n jo\nb \nan\nd \nin\nfo\nrm\nat\nio\nn \nab\nou\nt \nsp\nec\nifi\nc \nco\npi\nng\n b\neh\nav\nio\nur\ns \npl\nus\n t\nra\nin\nin\ng \nin\n c\nog\nni\ntiv\ne \nre\nst\nru\nct\nur\nin\ng \nan\nd \npo\nsi\ntiv\ne \nse\nlf-\nta\nlk\n \nan\nd \nst\nat\nem\nen\nts\n t\no \nbo\nls\nte\nr \nse\nlf-\nef\nfic\nac\ny \nas\n a\n p\nar\nt \nof\n t\nhe\n o\nri\nen\nta\nti\non\n \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne)\nM\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n:\nN\non\ne\nN\no\nIn\nte\nnt\nio\nn \nto\n \nre\nm\nai\nn;\n jo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn;\n \nor\nga\nni\nsa\ntio\nna\nl \nco\nm\nm\nitm\nen\nt\nIn\nte\nnt\nio\nns\n t\no \nre\nm\nai\nn \nan\nd \njo\nb \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn \nw\ner\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\nd \nus\nin\ng \nsc\nal\nes\n c\non\nst\nru\nct\ned\n b\ny \nth\ne \nau\nth\nor\ns\nO\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nna\nl c\nom\nm\nitm\nen\nt: \nM\now\nda\ny \net\n a\nl. \n(1\n97\n9)\n51\n6\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt:\nT\nhe\n o\nri\nen\nta\ntio\nn \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne \nha\nd \na \npo\nsi\ntiv\ne \nim\npa\nct\n o\nn \nal\nl t\nhe\n o\nut\nco\nm\nes\n \nin\n t\nhe\n lo\nng\n r\nun\nK\nle\nin\n a\nnd\n \nW\nea\nve\nr \n(2\n00\n0)\n51\n3\nU\nSA\nQ\nua\nsi\n-\nex\npe\nri\nm\nen\nta\nl\n11\n6 \nne\nw\n h\nir\nes\n3 \nm\non\nth\ns\nPr\nac\ntic\nes\n:\nO\nri\nen\nta\ntio\nn \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne\nM\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n:\nN\non\ne\nN\no\nLe\nve\nl o\nf l\nat\ner\n \nso\nci\nal\nis\nat\nio\nn;\n \nor\nga\nni\nsa\ntio\nna\nl \nco\nm\nm\nitm\nen\nt\nLe\nve\nl o\nf s\noc\nia\nlis\nat\nio\nn:\n C\nha\no \net\n a\nl. \n(1\n99\n4)\n51\n7\nO\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nna\nl c\nom\nm\nitm\nen\nt: \nA\nlle\nn \nan\nd \nM\ney\ner\n (1\n99\n0 )\n48\n6\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt:\nO\nri\nen\nta\ntio\nn \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne \nha\nd \na \npo\nsi\ntiv\ne \nim\npa\nct\n o\nn \nbo\nth\n le\nve\nl o\nf \nla\nte\nr \nso\nci\nal\nis\nat\nio\nn \nan\nd \nor\nga\nni\nsa\ntio\nna\nl \nco\nm\nm\nitm\nen\nt\nW\nes\nso\nn \nan\nd \nG\nog\nus\n \n(2\n00\n5)\n51\n4\nU\nSA\nQ\nua\nsi\n-\nex\npe\nri\nm\nen\nta\nl\n26\n1 \nne\nw\n h\nir\nes\n5 \nm\non\nth\ns\nPr\nac\ntic\nes\n:\nC\nom\npu\nte\nr-\nba\nse\nd \nor\nie\nnt\nat\nio\nn \npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne\nM\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n:\nN\non\ne\nN\no\nLe\nve\nl o\nf l\nat\ner\n \nso\nci\nal\nis\nat\nio\nn;\n \nor\nga\nni\nsa\ntio\nna\nl \nco\nm\nm\nitm\nen\nt;

Of the employee-\ncentric outcomes, there are three studies each \non absence and job satisfaction.\nResults\nTwo studies of flexitime used quasi-experimental \ndesign. A study by Narayanan and Nath522 reported \nthat the effects of flexitime and introduction \nof time monitoring devices on employees were \nmoderated by the hierarchical position of \nemployees in the organisation. For employees at \nlower levels (non-exempt employees), flexitime had \na beneficial impact on their social relationships and \nenhanced their flexibility. However, there was no \nimpact of flexitime on professionals, except a trend \ntowards deterioration in superior\u2013subordinate \nrelationships. The professionals resented the \nintroduction of punch cards and preferred to \nnegotiate work schedules with colleagues and \nmanagers on an informal basis. For managers, the \nintroduction of flexitime had no impact on any \nof the outcomes. Job satisfaction was found to be \nunrelated to the use or non-use of flexitime in the \norganisation. In contrast, the study by Dunham \net al.523 found that use of flexitime along with \ncompressed work week led to reports of greater \norganisational effectiveness, with employees \nexhibiting positive reactions towards both practices.\nLatack and Foster524 using quasi-experimental \ndesign, suggested substantial organisational \ngains including reduced sickness\u2013absence costs, \novertime costs, and personal leave time, as a \nresult of using compressed work weeks. However, \nuse of a compressed work week had no effect on \neither job satisfaction or error rates. The study \nalso investigated the interaction of participative \ndecision-making in the adoption of a compressed \nwork week, and concluded that such participation \nhas a positive impact on satisfaction with the \nwork schedule but not on other outcomes, such as \nsickness\u2013absence costs, overtime costs and personal \nleave.\nMarkham et al.525 investigated the impact of shift \nwork on the absence behaviour of employees, \nconcluding that all four factors (the shift and three \ntemporal factors of year, season and day of the \nweek) combine to account for 17% of the variance \nin absenteeism. Though no main effects were found \nfor the impact of shift time on absenteeism, there \nwere significant temporal effects on absenteeism. \nAlso, temporal effects of year, season and day of \nthe week interacted with shift timings to have \nsignificant effects on employee absenteeism.\nThe other scheduling and staffing issue \ninvestigated in studies was the perceived \nprocedural justice of work schedule. Posthuma \nand Campion526 found that perceived procedural \njustice in work assignments and work schedule \nwas positively related to employees giving \ntheir permission for their names to be used in \nrecruitment advertisements.\nOmissions\nAlthough there were no notable omissions, it is \ndifficult in this synthesis to draw any evidence-\nbased conclusions about the impact of a given \npractice on a given outcome because the papers \nconsidered are heterogeneous, focusing on \ndifferent aspects of the work schedule and on \ndifferent outcomes. Therefore, the evidence cannot \nbe synthesised into a single bottom-line conclusion. \nGiven the prevalence of the organisational use \nof flexitime, compressed work week, and shift \nwork, it was anticipated that there would be more \nlongitudinal research on these variables. However, \nthis review found relatively few longitudinal studies \nin this area.\nSummary\nThe six studies in this review researched how \ndifferent forms of work schedules (flexitime, \ncompressed work week, shift work and perceived \nprocedural justice of assigning work schedule) \nimpact on various employee and organisational \noutcomes. Only flexitime and compressed work \nweek were studied by two papers; all other \npractices were examined by only one study. A wide \nrange of outcomes was investigated, including \nfinancial outcomes in the form of overtime costs, \ncustomer outcomes such as quality of client \nservice, performance outcomes (e.g. error rates, \nproductivity and work performance) and employee \noutcomes in the form of affective employee states, \njob satisfaction and sickness\u2013absence rates. The \nresults of this section cannot be presented in an \nadditive manner as the practices and outcomes \nstudied are varied. Hence, each study needs to \nbe considered in isolation. More longitudinal \nresearch needs to be undertaken to arrive at a firm \nconclusion as to how each of these practices can be \nreliably linked to achieving a given outcome.\nTraining and development\nStudies in this section provide evidence on the \nvarious forms of training and development \npractices in organisations.

Thirteen of these studies were conducted \nin the USA: seven in the UK, and one each in \nSweden, France, Israel, Finland, and Canada. Two \nstudies used a complete RCT experimental design, \n11 studies used quasi-experimental methods, 10 \nhad a prospective longitudinal research design, \nand three studies used a retrospective longitudinal \ndesign. The duration of the studies varied from \n4 weeks to 20 years. The sample size of these \nstudies varied from 20 to 1091 employees.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nStudies on the impact of training to enhance \nemployees\u2019 performance or skill set were the \nsingle largest subcategory within the training and \ndevelopment category. There were 13 studies \nthat looked at how various forms of training, for \nexample training on psychometric errors in ratings, \ncompetency-based HRD counsellor training, \nteacher training programme, training in reflective \ncommunication, time management training and \nskill enhancement in general.\nFour longitudinal studies assessed the impact of \ncareer enhancement training for employees. The \nspecific practices investigated were career self-\nmanagement training, management support for \nself-development initiative (career workshops, \ndevelopment workbooks and guides, and PDPs), \nand lifelong learning and training programmes.\nThere were two studies of training to increase \nemployees\u2019 awareness of cultural issues in a \nculturally diverse work environment.\nThree studies considered training employees to \nbetter understand the existing organisational \nculture and integrate well with the rest of the \nworkforce.\nFour studies looked at training employees in \npreparation for TQM being implemented at the \norganisation.\nOutcomes\nStudies under the subcategory of performance \nand skill enhancement measured improvement \nin performance or relevant skills as outcome \nvariables. The outcomes studied in this subcategory \nwere rating efficiency, leadership and its impact \non subordinates\u2019 self-efficacy, interpersonal \ndiscrimination and communication skills, \nhousekeeping skills and time management.\nSix studies34,149,531\u2013534 examined training and \ndevelopment alongside various other practices. \nThese studies had multiple outcomes and \nranged from investigation of the impact of HRM \npractices on organisational performance at large \nto employee outcomes, for example employee \nsatisfaction and labour turnover.\nStudies on career or employee development \ntraining programmes had the following variables \nas outcomes: career self-management activity, \nemployee career satisfaction, participation in \nself-development training programmes, and \nperceptions of employee psychological contract.\nThe impact of cultural sensitivity training \nprogrammes was measured by the extent of \ndifferential treatment of culturally different \nindividuals and effective employee mindset towards \nacquisition.\nResearch in training for organisational socialisation \nlooked at the following outcomes: intention \nto remain, job satisfaction, organisational \ncommitment, academic self-efficacy, intention to \nquit the organisation and the profession, ability to \ncope and job performance.\nStudies of TQM training measured outcomes such \nas teamwork, quality level, financial performance \nand RBSE.\nResults\nPerformance and skill enhancement \ntraining\nOf the 13 studies in this category, 10 found that \ntraining helped to improve the targeted skill sets \nand employee performance. Ivancevich535 used \na full experimental design to show that intense \ntraining compared with mere discussion or no \ntraining, helped reduce errors. Similarly, studies \nby Cash and Vellema,536 Rautalinko and Lisper,537 \nLeivo,538 Green and Skinner,539 Adam,531 and Price \nand Mueller532 concluded that training leads to a \nrange of positive results, for example improvement \nin communication skills, job performance, \nplanning and prioritising. At the organisational \nlevel, general skill enhancement was associated \nwith reduced labour turnover, in organisational \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

A study by Eden et al.540 consisting of \nseven field experiments, failed to find any evidence \nof the efficacy of a specific form of leadership \ntraining and concluded that such training had \nno effect on either leaders or their followers. \nSimilarly, Jacob and Lefgren541 found that marginal \nincreases in the in-service training of teachers had \nno statistically or academically significant effect \non the reading or mathematical achievements of \nelementary school children in high-poverty schools.\nCareer or employee development \ntraining\nProviding training to employees for their own \ncareer development led to positive employee \nreactions and better outcomes, for example \nemployee career satisfaction, participation \nin self-development training programmes, \nand perceptions of employee psychological \ncontract.542\u2013544\nKossek et al.,545 however, found that such training \nefforts were not successful in increasing employees\u2019 \ntendencies to engage in career self-management \nactivities.\nCultural sensitivity training\nStudies on the impact of training employees with \nthe intention of improving their sensitivity to other \ncultures have mixed results. The study by Sanchez \nand Medkik546 concluded that providing cultural \ndiversity training did not result in a straightforward \nimprovement in employees\u2019 cultural sensitivity; \nthe ethnicity of the co-worker interacted with \nthe training received, such that trainees received \nhigher ratings of differential treatment from \nnon-white co-workers than did matched controls. \nSchweiger and Goulet547 reported positive \ntraining outcomes leading to change in employee \nmindset by using a \u2018deep-level cultural learning\u2019, \nintervention, characterised by creating an ongoing \ndialogue between partners on cultural awareness \nand cultural introspection.\nSocialisation training to understand \norganisational culture\nThere were three longitudinal studies in this \nsection, all of which found positive impacts of \nsocialisation training on employee outcomes, \nincluding intention to remain, organisational \ncommitment, professional commitment, job \nsatisfaction, ability to cope with the new place and \njob performance.512,548,549\nTQM training\nFour studies looked at TQM training, two of \nwhich looked directly at training prior to the \nintroduction to TQM practices. The way in which \nTQM was implemented and the purpose of its \nintroduction varied greatly between the studies. \nThe study by Coyle-Shapiro550 concluded that \nTQM intervention does not have a significant \ndirect effect on changes in teamwork; employees\u2019 \nperceptions of the training are more important \nthan actual participation in the intervention. \nThus, if employees perceive the intervention to be \nbeneficial and appropriate, and their supervisors \nreinforce its importance, positive changes to \nintermediate variables such as trust in colleagues, \nsupervisory satisfaction, and improvement in \ngeneral commitment to quality, are more likely. \nOf these hypothesised mediating variables, it \nwas only trust in colleagues that was found to be \nfurther predictive of teamwork. Other than trust \nin colleagues, the intermediate variables that were \nfound to influence teamwork were satisfaction with \ncolleagues, and quality awareness.\nThe study by Murray and Raffaele551 found good \nsupport for the impact of TQM training and \nimplementation on both quality level and dollar \nutility value of the training programme.\nWhen these two studies are viewed together, they \nprovide valuable information on the mechanism \nthrough which TQM can influence a final outcome, \nfor example quality improvement.\nThe other two studies in this category did not \nuse TQM per se but explored the impact of \ntraining in quality management and the impact \nof participation in improvement groups on an \nindividual\u2019s RBSE.454,458 Both studies concluded \nthat membership of improvement groups had a \npositive impact on an individual\u2019s RBSE.\nOmissions\nTraining and development of employees has \nalways been a much investigated area of research. \nHowever, the present review finds that there \nis still a very limited number of studies with \nlongitudinal design on the efficacy of these \ntraining programmes. For example, organisations \nexpend considerable resources on programmes \nsuch as executive MBA qualifications; however, \nthe review did not find any research on how such \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n168\nan investment leads to better organisational or \nemployee performance.\nSummary\nThere are 26 studies in this review on training and \ndevelopment. Two studies used a RCT method, \n10 used a quasi-experimental design, 12 used a \nprospective longitudinal design and two used a \nretrospective longitudinal design. The studies \nin this section can be grouped in five major \ncategories; performance and skill enhancement \ntraining, career or employee development training, \ncultural sensitivity training, socialisation training \nto understand organisational culture, and TQM \ntraining. Each study used a distinct outcome \nrelevant to the training being provided. Overall, \nthe results indicated that training predicted desired \nimpacts, both at the individual and organisational \nlevel, and provides worthwhile return on \ninvestment. However, the review found a lack of \nlongitudinal research on the efficacy of the high \nexpenditure training programmes, for example \nexecutive MBA, used by organisations to up-skill \ntheir employees.\nCompensation and rewards\nOrganisations use various types of compensation \nand reward plans as instruments for influencing \nnumerous objectives of vital organisational interest. \nIn this review, the types of compensation and \nreward systems that have been investigated by the \nresearchers using longitudinal design are:\n\u2022\t various types of incentive plans, bonuses, \nemployee stock option plans (ESOPs) and gain-\nsharing\n\u2022\t merit-based pay, performance-related pay, \nearnings-at-risk plans and perceptions of pay \nfairness.\nPromotions\nCombinations of compensation and rewards with \nvarious other HRM practices.\nDetails of studies\nTwenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria \n(Table 49). Twenty-three of these studies were \nconducted in the USA and one each in France, \nHong Kong, Ireland, India, Israel and the \nUK. One study used experimental design with \nfull randomisation, eight studies used quasi-\nexperimental methods, thirteen had a prospective \nlongitudinal research design and seven used a \nretrospective analysis of longitudinal data sets. \nThe duration of the studies varied from 2 weeks \nto 20 years. The sample size of these 29 studies \nvaried from 38 to 3355 employees. Six studies \nreported data from organisations as a whole; one \ninvestigated four plants, one had data from five \nfederal offices of the USA, one had data from 20 \nlocal and regional federal offices of the USA, two \ninvestigated five units of a single organisation, and \none used organisational data from 42 different \nfirms.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nAll studies used one of the four types of \ncompensation and reward systems intended to \nachieve various types of outcomes mentioned \nabove.\n\u2022\t Eight studies on incentive plans investigated \nhow various types of financial incentives, \nbonuses, ESOPs and gain-sharing could achieve \nthe desired outcomes.\n\u2022\t Nine longitudinal studies were found on merit \npay, performance-related pay, earnings-at-risk \npay plans and employees\u2019 perceptions of fair \npay. These studies focused on the use of pay or \nrewards based on employee performance, and \nshowed the relative merits and demerits of the \nvarious plan types.\n\u2022\t There were four studies on the impact of \npromotion as an incentive for achieving the \ndesired outcomes.\n\u2022\t Finally, this section also contains eight studies \nthat used a combination of various HRM \npractices along with an incentive plan to \nachieve given outcomes.\nOutcomes\nA wide range of outcomes were measured in these \n29 studies. Employee performance in one form or \nthe other was the most studied outcome, with 14 \nstudies investigating job performance and three \nstudies concentrating on productivity gains as a \nresult of compensation and incentive plans. Job \nturnover or intention turnover was the other major \noutcome of interest in this area. Five studies had \njob turnover as an outcome and two had intent to \nturnover as the dependent variable. Absenteeism \nwas studied in three research papers.\nOther dependent variables investigated were bonus \nor pay satisfaction, organisational commitment, \noccupational commitment, intrinsic motivation, job \ninvolvement, job satisfaction, job anxiety, physical \nhealth and mental health.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The \nmain distinction between this subcategory and the \nnext (merit pay, pay at risk, etc.) was that incentives \ndid not affect salary. The focus was rather to \nencourage employees to perform better for gaining \nmonetary awards over and above their base pay. \nLargely, all studies in this category concluded that \nincentives had a positive effect on the desired \noutcome.\nThere was only one study that used complete \nrandomisation and conducted RCTs to understand \nhow three interventions (financial bonus, enhanced \nfees for immunisation services, and feedback on \ntheir performance) helped improve immunisation \nperformance among paediatricians.562 The authors \nreported that of the three schemes, cash bonus \nresulted in the maximum positive impact on the \nimmunisation service. The quasi-experimental \nstudy by Petty et al.563 also found that an incentive \nplan targeted at the division as a whole led to \nbetter performance of that division compared with \na control group without an incentive plan. There \nwas a significant increase in employee productivity \nand other measures of job performance along \nwith improvement in employee attitudes toward \nthe organisation. The other three studies on the \nuse of financial rewards and bonuses, employing \nprospective longitudinal designs, also found a \npositive relationship between use of rewards and \nincentives and the desired outcomes, for example \nproductivity, job satisfaction, job commitment \nand employee turnover. The study by Buchko564 \nreported that employees with greater perceived \ninfluence as a result of an ESOP programme \nand those with greater financial value in the \nprogramme were more satisfied with the pay plan, \nmore committed to the organisation, had lower \nturnover intention and were less likely to leave the \norganisation.\nUse of a gain-sharing plan, characterised by \ncombining a system of plant-wide bonuses with a \ncomprehensive employee involvement programme, \nwas reported by one study which found that it had \na positive impact on long-term grievance rates as \nwell as employee absenteeism.565\nBhattacherjee566 found that group incentives were \nmore effective in increasing productivity when used \nwith smaller groups than when applied to large \ngroups, for example whole departments.\nMerit-based pay, performance-related pay, \nearnings-at-risk plans and perceptions of pay \nfairness\nThe studies on merit or performance-related pay \ndiffered from those on incentives and bonuses in \nthat there was some component of an employee\u2019s \nsalary that was at risk of being reduced unless \na particular level of performance was achieved. \nThe performance-related-pay papers invariably \nfound that merit-based pay was not liked by the \nemployees.567 The major point of contention in \nperformance-related pay was the perceived fairness \nin the performance appraisal system on which the \nwhole scheme rests. Though there was a general \ndissatisfaction among workers where performance-\nrelated pay or some form of earning-at-risk plans \nwere used, studies reported an improvement in \nperformance indicators and desired outcomes, for \nexample reduced absence, when these pay plans \nare implemented.568\u2013571\nPromotions:\nUse of promotion as an incentive to reward higher \nperformers was quite widely used in organisations. \nHowever, the results from the studies reviewed here \nfound that use of promotions as an incentive can \nlead to mixed outcomes.\nStudies by Johnston et al.572 and Schwarzwald et \nal.573 reported that the impact of promotions on \ngiven outcomes was moderated by promotion \ndecisions. Those who were promoted as a reward \nfor good performance showed better future \nperformance and were more likely to stay with the \norganisation than those who were not promoted.\nHowever, some studies pointed out that the \nnegative consequences of employees not being \npromoted when they feel entitled. The study by \nSchwarzwald et al.573 found failure to get promotion \nwas associated with feelings of inequity, decreased \ncommitment and increased absenteeism. Johnston \net al.572 found that the initial positive effects of \npromotion were unsustainable in the long run \nand that job attitudes declined over time, even for \npromoted employees. Similar results were found \nby Lam and Schaubroeck574 and Pergamit and \nVeum.575\nCombination of compensation and rewards with \nvarious other HRM practices\nThe eight studies in this category used rewards \nalong with other HRM practices for achieving \ndesired employee or organisational outcomes. Five \nof these studies showed that compensation and \nrewards in interaction with various other HRM \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n184\npractices had a positive effect. Studies by Pritchard \net al.576,577 found that although feedback alone was \ninstrumental in improving the performance of \nemployees by 50%, when feedback was used with \ngoal setting and incentives, productivity improved \nby 76%. Similarly, a study by Knight et al.578 found \nthat combining incentives with difficult goals \nachieved best results.\nHowever, studies by Price and Mueller532 and \nD\u2019Arcimoles533 found that pay and compensation \nby itself failed to have any direct effect on \nlabour turnover and the firm\u2019s overall economic \nperformance. The compensation and pay system \nneed to be combined with practices such as training \nto achieve the desired impact.\nOmissions\nThere were no significant omissions in the \nlongitudinal literature on the relationship between \ncompensation and rewards and desirable outcomes. \nHowever, given the popularity of incentive plans, \nfor example ESOPs, it was surprising to find \nonly one study on how ESOPs can impact on \nemployee behaviour. There seems to be a paucity \nof longitudinal research on the impact of ESOPs on \nemployee performance and turnover.\nSummary\nIn this review there were 29 studies that explored \nthe impact of compensation and rewards systems \non given employee and organisational outcomes, \nfor example job performance, productivity, job \nturnover, absence and various other employee \nattitude variables. Nine out of the 29 studies were \nexperimental or quasi-experimental in design, \nwith 13 studies using prospective longitudinal \ndesign and seven using retrospective analysis on \npre-existing longitudinal data sets. The studies \nin this section can be grouped in four broad \ncategories depending on the type of compensation \nand reward plan under investigation; incentive \nand bonus plans, gain-sharing schemes; merit- \nor performance-related pay and employee pay \nfairness perceptions; promotions; and studies \nusing compensation and rewards in combination \nwith other HRM interventions. Largely, the \nimpact of incentives and bonuses was positive \nwhereas that of merit-based pay was negative. \nPromotions had both positive and negative impacts \ndepending on the promotion decision. Studies \nresearching combinations of compensation and \nrewards with other HRM practices found positive \nand interaction effects with these other practices. \nOverall, there seems to be a paucity of longitudinal \nresearch on the impact of ESOPs on organisational \nand employee outcomes.\nCommunication\nThrough communication, organisations and \ntheir members exchange information, form \nunderstandings, coordinate activities, exercise \ninfluence, socialise, and generate and maintain \nsystems of beliefs, symbols, and values. \nOrganisations have two distinct communication \nsystems; formal and informal. The formal \ncommunications system is a part of the \norganisational structure and includes supervisory \nrelationships, work groups, permanent and ad hoc \ncommittees, and management information systems. \nThe informal communication system emerges \nfrom day-to-day interaction among organisational \nmembers.

For the first \ncategory of studies, Schweiger and DeNisi596 \nfound that realistic merger previews were a good \ntool for limiting the dysfunctional outcomes of a \nmerger, resulting in lower stress, job dissatisfaction, \nabsenteeism and job turnover, and improved \ncommitment and employee performance. However, \nthe study by Henessey et al.597 found that although \na benefit awareness programme had a positive \nimpact on satisfaction with benefits and the \norganisation, it had no effect on employee job \nsatisfaction. Similarly, the study by Kinnunen et \nal.598 found that a dedicated restorative strategy \nusing honest communication with employees, to \nprovide reassurance of job security and maintain \na positive work atmosphere, did result in lower \nlevels of job insecurity and improvements in \nrelationships with the colleagues. However, the \ngeneral communication system in the organisation \nwas completely unrelated to employees\u2019 feelings of \njob security.\nThe studies by Parker454 and Axtell and Parker458 \nboth concluded that, although quality of \ncommunication briefings had a positive impact on \nemployees perception of their RBSE, the quantity \nof such communication had no similar impact.\nOmissions\nManagement theory places great emphasis on \ndevising organisational communication plans for \ninternal and external stakeholders, yet it appears \nthat little of that has translated in longitudinal \npeer-reviewed research. Five studies met the review \ncriteria for HRM practice in this area, but they \nfocused on a limited range of possible outcomes. \nThere appears to be substantial scope for further \nlongitudinal research on the impact of different \ncommunication practices.\nSummary\nThe five studies in this section provided evidence \non how various forms of communication can be \nused to achieve the employee outcomes of reduced \ndysfunctional outcomes during a merger, feelings \nof job security, job satisfaction and enhanced \nRBSE. One study used a quasi-experimental \ndesign, while four used a prospective longitudinal \ndesign. The studies can be divided in to two \ncategories. In the first category were studies that \ndealt with communication by the organisation \nto create awareness of a given programme or \nany impending changes. In the second category \nwere studies dealing with quality and quantity of \ncommunication briefs given to employees and their \nimpact on RBSE. The results of these interventions \nare mixed. There was some support for the impact \nof tailored communication strategies dealing with \nspecific issues as opposed to general organisational \ncommunications; however, this was based on only \nfive eligible studies.\nFamily friendly\nThe term \u2018family friendly workplace\u2019 (or \u2018work \nand family\u2019) is one which recognises the non-\nworkplace family responsibilities of its employees, \nand develops and implements policies that aim \nto help employees simultaneously fulfil work \nand family commitments. Some authors extend \nthe use of the term to include practices that are \nemployee friendly and take care of the well-being \nof employees and their families (such as general \nemployee assistance programmes or specific help \nfor drug or alcohol addiction).\nDetails of studies\nFour studies met the inclusion criteria (Table 51). \nAll studies were conducted in the USA.

The study by \nBertera603 used a quasi-experimental research \ndesign and collected data from 43,888 employees \nworking in 60 different sites. It concluded that \nthe company\u2019s workplace health promotion \nprogramme gave good return on investment \nand led to significant reductions in employee \nabsence. The study by Astrup et al.604 came to a \nsimilar conclusion, and the company\u2019s wellness \nprogramme was especially effective for middle-\naged participants as it reduced their rates of \nmedical claims. The third study in this category \nmeasured the impact of employer provided health \ninsurance on employee turnover. The study found \nthat employer provided health insurance had no \nimpact on married employees\u2019 decisions to change \ntheir jobs and had a very small impact on the \nunmarried males.605\nThe only study on the uptake of workplace support, \nin the form of alternate work arrangements and \nemployees\u2019 use of dependent care, found mixed \neffects. Hammer et al.606 concluded that use of \nalternative work arrangements and dependent care \nsupports were positively related to reduced levels of \nfamily\u2013work conflict in dual-earner couples. Use of \nworkplace support was also positively related to job \nsatisfaction over time. However, the study found \nthat couples\u2019 use of workplace support did not \nappear to have an impact on individual reports of \nwork\u2013family conflict.\nOmissions\nThis review found only four longitudinal studies \nthat explored the efficacy of family-\/employee-\nfriendly policies or practices as HRM interventions, \nand these were limited in scope. Practices, \nfor example flexible working arrangements, \npermanent part-time work, job-sharing, career \nbreak schemes, paid or unpaid family leave, \nand assistance with child care and elder-care \nresponsibilities, which can help workers balance \ntheir work and family responsibilities, need to be \nexamined longitudinally to establish the nature of \ntheir impact.\nSummary\nThe four studies in this category investigated \nthe impact of family and employee-friendly \npolicies, such as health promotion programmes \nand workplace support. One study used a quasi-\nexperimental research design, one used prospective \nlongitudinal and two others used a retrospective \nlongitudinal research design. The results of these \nstudies indicated that use of company sponsored \nhealth and wellness programmes are value for \nmoney and help reduce absenteeism. However, \ncompany provided health insurance benefit has no \neffect on employees\u2019 decisions to stay or leave from \nthe company. Use of alternative work arrangements \nand dependent care support is positively related \nto reduced family\u2013work conflict in dual-earner \ncouples but couple level use of such support is not \nrelated to work\u2013family conflict. There seemed to \nbe substantial gaps in longitudinal research on \nfamily and employee friendly practice, with no \npeer-reviewed longitudinal research available on \ntopics including flexible working arrangements, \npermanent part-time work, job-sharing, career \nbreak schemes, paid or unpaid family leave, \nand assistance with child care and elder-care \nresponsibilities, which aim to help workers balance \ntheir work and family responsibilities.\nEmployee participation, \nrepresentation and involvement\nThe terms employee participation\/representation\/\ninvolvement have been used to describe a wide \nrange of practices in organisations.511 Common \nto all of these practices is the attention paid \nto increasing employees\u2019 influence over how \ntheir work is carried out or over other areas of \norganisational policy and practice.511\nDetails of studies\nEight studies met the inclusion criteria for the \nreview (Table 52). Three of these studies were \nconducted in the USA, two in Australia, and \none each in Germany, the Netherlands, and \nKorea. Seven studies had a quasi-experimental \nresearch design and one study had a prospective \nlongitudinal research design. The duration of the \nstudies varied from 32 days to 22 months. The \nsample size of these eight studies varied from 43 to \n182 employees.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nOf these eight studies, only two studies are \ndiscussed exclusively in this section.608,609 \nThese studies researched the role of employee \nparticipation in the process of introducing changes \nto their own jobs, and the impact of employee \nparticipation in the job evaluation process, as HR \npractices.\nThe other six studies used employee participation \nin conjunction with other practices, for example \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n190 TA\nB\nLE\n 5\n2 \nEm\npl\noy\nee\n r\nep\nre\nse\nnt\nat\nio\nn\/\nin\nvo\nlve\nm\nen\nt\/p\nar\ntic\nip\nat\nio\nn\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, d\nur\nat\nio\nn\nP\nra\nct\nic\ne(\ns)\n\/in\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n);\n \nm\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n \n(i\nf a\nny\n)\nFM\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nC\noc\nh \nan\nd \nFr\nen\nch\n \n(1\n94\n8)\n60\n8\nU\nSA\nQ\nua\nsi\n-e\nxp\ner\nim\nen\nta\nl \nde\nsi\ngn\n46\n e\nm\npl\noy\nee\ns\n32\n d\nay\ns \nEm\npl\noy\nee\n p\nar\ntic\nip\nat\nio\nn \nin\n t\nhe\n \npr\noc\nes\ns \nof\n in\ntr\nod\nuc\nin\ng \nch\nan\nge\ns \nto\n t\nhe\n jo\nb\nM\nod\ner\nat\nor\n\/m\ned\nia\nto\nr:\nN\non\ne\nN\no\nPr\nod\nuc\ntiv\nit\ny;\n la\nbo\nur\n \ntu\nrn\nov\ner\nC\nom\npa\nny\n d\nat\na\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt:\nPa\nrt\nic\nip\nat\nio\nn \nof\n e\nm\npl\noy\nee\ns \nin\n t\nhe\n p\nro\nce\nss\n \nof\n m\nak\nin\ng \nch\nan\nge\ns \nto\n t\nhe\nir\n jo\nbs\n r\ned\nuc\nes\n \nth\ne \nre\nsi\nst\nan\nce\n t\no \nch\nan\nge\n a\nnd\n in\ncr\nea\nse\ns \nth\nei\nr \npo\nst\n c\nha\nng\ne \npr\nod\nuc\ntiv\nit\ny.\n It\n a\nls\no \nhe\nlp\ns \nin\n r\ned\nuc\nin\ng \nem\npl\noy\nee\n t\nur\nno\nve\nr\nM\nor\nge\nso\nn \net\n a\nl.  \n(2\n00\n1)\n60\n9\nU\nSA\nQ\nua\nsi\n-e\nxp\ner\nim\nen\nta\nl\n16\n8 \nem\npl\noy\nee\ns\n3 \nm\non\nth\ns\nEm\npl\noy\nee\n p\nar\ntic\nip\nat\nio\nn \nin\n jo\nb \nev\nal\nua\ntio\nn \npr\noc\nes\ns\nM\nod\ner\nat\nor\n\/m\ned\nia\nto\nr:\nN\non\ne\nN\no\nPa\ny \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn\nPS\nQ\n (\nH\nor\nem\nan\n a\nnd\n S\nch\nw\nab\n \n19\n85\n)6\n15\nN\no \nef\nfe\nct\n:\nPa\nrt\nic\nip\nat\nio\nn \nin\n t\nhe\n jo\nb \nev\nal\nua\ntio\nn \npr\noc\nes\ns \nm\nad\ne \nno\n im\npa\nct\n o\nn \nem\npl\noy\nee\n \npa\ny \nsa\ntis\nfa\nct\nio\nn\nK\nle\nin\nbe\nck\n a\nnd\n \nFu\nhr\nm\nan\nn \n(2\n00\n0)\n61\n0\nG\ner\nm\nan\ny\nQ\nua\nsi\n-e\nxp\ner\nim\nen\nta\nl\n43\n e\nm\npl\noy\nee\ns\n22\n m\non\nth\ns \nPa\nrt\nic\nip\nat\niv\ne \npr\nod\nuc\ntiv\nit\ny \nm\nan\nag\nem\nen\nt \n(P\nPM\n) \nsy\nst\nem\n \nN\no\nPr\nod\nuc\ntiv\nit\ny\nG\nro\nup\n c\noh\nes\nio\nn\nO\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nna\nl p\nro\ndu\nct\niv\nit\ny \nm\nea\nsu\nre\nG\nro\nup\n c\noh\nes\nio\nn:\n A\nda\npt\ned\n \nfr\nom\n t\nhr\nee\n s\nca\nle\ns \n\u2013 \nW\nid\nm\ney\ner\n \net\n a\nl. \n19\n85\n;61\n6  \nLu\nht\nan\nen\n a\nnd\n \nC\nro\nck\ner\n (1\n99\n2)\n,61\n7  W\nag\nne\nr \nan\nd \nZ\nic\nk \n(1\n99\n3)\n61\n8\nPo\nsit\nive\n e\nff\nec\nt:\nPP\nM\n le\nd \nto\n im\npr\nov\ned\n p\nro\ndu\nct\niv\nit\ny\nN\no \nef\nfe\nct\n:\nPP\nM\n h\nad\n n\no \nef\nfe\nct\n o\nn \ngr\nou\np \nco\nhe\nsi\non\nPe\nar\nso\nn \n(1\n98\n7)\n61\n1\nA\nus\ntr\nal\nia\nQ\nua\nsi\n-e\nxp\ner\nim\nen\nta\nl\n42\n t\nea\nm\ns\n12\n m\non\nth\ns\nPa\nrt\nic\nip\nat\niv\ne \ngo\nal\n s\net\ntin\ng\nYe\ns\nPe\nrf\nor\nm\nan\nce\n;

The study by Coch and \nFrench608 found that participation of employees \nin the process of introducing changes to their jobs \nled to less resistance to change, improved labour \nproductivity and helped reduce labour turnover. In \ncontrast, the study by Morgeson et al.609 found that \nemployee participation in a job evaluation process \nhad no effect on employee pay satisfaction.\nThere were five studies on the use of participation \nin performance\/productivity management \npractices. All five studies supported the conclusion \nthat participation and involvement in any form \nof performance management practice positively \nimpacts on outcomes, for example productivity, job \nperformance, job satisfaction, role ambiguity and \nrole conflict.610\u2013614\nThe eighth study was on the use of employee \nparticipation in the implementation of a \ncompressed work week. It concluded that those \ninvolved in the decision to adopt a compressed \nworking week expressed greater satisfaction with \ntheir work schedule than those not involved in the \ndecision.524\nOmissions\nFor this review, two studies had a primary focus on \nthe effects of participation. The remaining studies \nall included participation as part of the evaluation \nof another HRM practice.\nSummary\nThere were eight studies in this category, with six \nalso being discussed in other sections, namely \nperformance management and staffing. Seven of \nthese studies used quasi-experimental design and \none used a prospective longitudinal study. The \nmajority supported the positive impact of using \nemployee participation when making key decisions \nthat affect their working. There appeared to be less \nemphasis in the literature on using longitudinal \nresearch design to study the impact of participation \npractices, such as collective bargaining and \nemployee involvement in strategic decision-\nmaking.\nPerformance appraisal and \nperformance management\nStudies in this section cover performance appraisal \nand performance management practices.\nDetails of studies\nTwenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (Table \n53). Nineteen of these studies were conducted \nin USA, two in Australia and one each in the \nNetherlands, Germany, New Zealand and Korea. \nOne study used a complete RCT experimental \ndesign, nine studies used quasi-experimental \nmethods and 15 had a prospective longitudinal \nresearch design. The duration of the studies varied \nfrom 7 weeks to 6 years. The sample size of these \n25 studies varied from five teacher\u2013student dyads \n(10 persons in all) to 4413 employees.\nHRM practice\/intervention\nThe studies were concerned with one of the \nfollowing:\n\u2022\t feedback\n\u2022\t goal setting, alone or in combination with \nfeedback and\/or incentives\n\u2022\t performance or productivity management \nsystems, alone or in combination with \nfeedback, goal setting, and incentives\n\u2022\t performance appraisal.\nThe largest number of the studies was on the use \nof feedback systems and their ability to influence \ndesired outcomes. There were 13 studies that had \nfeedback as their main independent variable, \nfocusing on how rich feedback, characterised by \nlarge amounts of specific and positive information \non one\u2019s work behaviour, can impact on \nperformance and employee outcomes.\nGoal setting, either alone or in combination with \nfeedback and\/or incentives, was investigated by six \nstudies. The focus of these studies was on Locke\u2019s620 \ntheory of goal setting, exploring how performance \nand attitudinal outcomes can be influenced by \nthe way in which goal setting is conducted and \nimplemented.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Three of these studies investigated \nthe impact of a productivity management tool \n[Productivity Measurement and Enhancement \nSystem (ProMES)], on employee productivity and \nattitudinal outcomes.\nThere were two studies on how different types of \nperformance appraisal or performance appraisal \nreviews can impact on given outcomes.\nOf the remaining studies in this section, one looked \nat electronic monitoring of employees at work, one \nat recognition, and one at operant conditioning \nreinforcement schedules to boost performance or \nother desired outcomes.\nOutcomes\nSixteen of the 25 studies looked at job performance \nor productivity as one of their outcomes. Job \nsatisfaction was the second most investigated \noutcome variable, with eight studies including it as \ntheir dependent variable. Other variables that were \ninvestigated in these studies are attendance, safety \nbehaviour and turnover.\nResults\nFeedback\nOf the 13 studies on feedback, eight were on \nfeedback alone and the rest were on feedback \nin combination with either goal setting or some \nform of performance or productivity management \nsystem. Four studies investigated how feedback \nimpacts on job performance \u2013 all four used a \nprospective longitudinal design and indicated that \nfeedback leads to a significant improvement in job \nperformance of employees. Two of these studies \nused upward feedback (subordinate feedback \non supervisor performance) as an intervention \nand found that it enhanced managerial job \nperformance.621,622 One study investigated \nhow feedback sharing with raters and seeking \nsuggestions for improvement can influence the \nratee\u2019s performance. The study concluded that, \nalthough there was a statistically significant \ndifference between the ratees who shared their \nfeedback and sought advice and those who did not, \nthe effect size of improvement in performance was \nvery low and explained only 2% of the variance.623 \nTwo studies on feedback, using quasi-experimental \ndesigns, found that a significantly positive impact \non employee productivity.612,624 Two other studies, \none quasi-experimental and the other prospective \nlongitudinal, concluded that feedback enhanced \nthe safety behaviour of employees.625,626 The study \nby Codding et al.627 reported that use of feedback \ncan enhance the implementation integrity of an \nintervention programme. Feedback also helped \nto improve job satisfaction and reduce job \nturnover.612,628\nGoal setting, feedback and incentives\nThere were three studies on goal setting alone. Two \nof these used a quasi-experimental design and one \nused a prospective longitudinal research design. \nAll three studies concluded that goal setting has \na positive impact on job performance and job \nsatisfaction, and showed that participative goal \nsetting is particularly beneficial.611,629 However, the \nstudy by Ivancevich630 found that the effects of goal \nsetting on job performance were not permanent \nand tended to dissipate after 12 months.\nThe other three studies were on goal setting in \ncombination with feedback or financial incentives. \nTwo studies concluded that goal setting works \nbest when it is participative and combined with \nadequate feedback.624,625 Campbell631 used an \nexperimental design and reported that incentives \nlinked to goal setting led to better performance \nthan when incentives are paid at an hourly rate.\nPerformance or productivity management systems, \nfeedback and incentives\nAll performance management systems used a \ncombination of practices to achieve their desired \noutcomes. Of the six studies in this category, \nfive investigated how these systems influenced \nproductivity or employee performance. All of these \nstudies concluded that performance or productivity \nmanagement systems enhanced employee \nperformance or increased productivity.576,577,610,612,613 \nThree of these studies were on the use of ProMES \nand all three concluded that, although feedback \nalone improves productivity by around 50% \nwhen combined with goal setting and incentives, \nproductivity goes up by 76%.576,577 The sixth \nstudy on the use of a performance management \nsystem explored the impact of a newly installed \nperformance management system, along with \npay for performance on employee attitudes. The \nstudy found that high and low performers reacted \ndifferently to use of a performance management \nsystem involving pay for performance. For low \nperformers, the new performance management \nsystem substantially increased ratings of satisfaction \nand cooperation with one\u2019s supervisor. In \ncontrast, high performers had a high baseline \nfor these attitudes towards supervision, followed \nby substantial drops immediately after receiving \nappraisal and bonus pay.632\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The study by \nMurray633 found that use of objective performance \nappraisal coming from management by objectives \nwas viewed more favourably than a trait-based \nperformance appraisal system. Lee and Son614 \nexplored the impact of performance appraisal \nreview on employee satisfaction and performance, \nand concluded that goal setting and career \ndiscussion components of the appraisal review \nwere positively related to employee satisfaction. \nHowever, overall performance appraisal review was \nfound to be unrelated to employee performance.\nStudies on miscellaneous practices of performance \nmanagement\nThere were three papers that explored the use of \nvarious performance management techniques to \nachieve outcomes, for example attendance and \njob performance. The paper by Westin634 found \nthat the use of electronic monitoring of employees \nattendance and working was associated with \ndecreased trust. The study by Markham et al.635 \nconcluded that a positive attendance management \nprogramme, characterised by recognition, personal \nattention, public celebration, use of mementoes, \nclarity of expectations and acknowledgement, can \nsignificantly improve employee attendance. Fellows \nand Mawhinney636 concluded that an operant-based \nsystem of individual rewards contingent on meeting \na group quota produced reliable performance \nincreases among the telemarketers.\nOmissions\nAlthough there were no significant omissions \non performance management, there does seem \nto be less longitudinal research on the use of \nvarious form of performance appraisal tools and \ntechniques, and their impact on individual, team \nor organisational performance. The current section \nhas only two studies on performance appraisal \nper se.\nSummary\nThere are 25 studies in this review on performance \nappraisal and performance management. One \nstudy used an RCT method, nine used quasi-\nexperimental methods, and 15 studies used \nprospective longitudinal design. The studies in this \nsection can be grouped in four major categories, \nnamely feedback, goal setting, performance \nmanagement systems and performance appraisal \nstudies. Three studies used various other \ntechniques to achieve the desired outcomes. The \nmost studied outcomes were job performance \nand job satisfaction, with 16 and eight papers, \nrespectively. Feedback was found to have a positive \nimpact on job performance and job satisfaction, \nbut feedback, in combination with goal setting \nand incentives, had a better impact on the desired \noutcomes. There seemed to be less emphasis by \nresearchers on conducting longitudinal studies on \nimpact of various types of performance appraisal \nsystems on performance-related outcomes, as only \none study explored that link.\nIntegrated measures\nIn this chapter we have been examining the impact \nof individual HRM practices on an outcome or \nplurality of outcomes, be they intermediate or \nfinal. It is often argued in the HRM literature \nthat management practices work best when \nused in conjunction with other practices that fit \ntogether as a coherent set. Such sets of internally \nconsistent practices are typically referred to as \nHR systems. The focus of much of the recent \ndiscussion has been on high-involvement systems, \nthe core of which are practices designed to foster \na high level of appropriate employee involvement \nand proactivity at all levels of the organisation. \nThe term high-performance work system has \nincreasingly been used \u2013 ahead of any strong \nevidence that the title is warranted \u2013 to label such \na system. According to the US Department of \nLabour (1993: 1)641 they are defined as: \u2018Systems of \nmutually reinforcing practices [that] create multiple \nways to develop worker skills, to align individual \nand organisational goals, and to share information \ncrucial to solving problems\u2019. In a similar vein, \na decade later, Datta et al. (2005: 135)642 saw \nthem as systems \u2018of HR (human resource) \npractices designed to enhance employees\u2019 skills, \ncommitment, and productivity\u2019.\nIn such accounts, the concept of a high-\nperformance work system is clearly linked to \nthe high-involvement management emphasis \non participation and employee commitment.1,191 \nThe argument is that high-performance systems \ngive workers sizeable discretion over their work, \nand provide the necessary skills and motivation \nfor them to use this discretion for the benefit of \nthe organisation. Work organisation practices, \ndesigned to provide opportunities for employee \nparticipation in substantive \u2018shop floor\u2019 decisions \n(Appelbaum et al. 2000: 26),13 are thus treated by \nsome as the core high-performance practices, while \nskill acquisition and motivational enhancement \npractices are the HRM practices that are \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n200\n\u2018supportive\u2019 of this participation (Gittleman et al. \n1998: 102).643 However, as Wood and Wall31 show, \nthe involvement aspect has increasingly been \nneglected in the empirical work on HRM systems, \nat least in the stream of cross-sectional studies that \ndeveloped in the 1980s following pioneering work \nby Arthur,14 MacDuffie,20 Huselid18 and others. As \nthe resource-based theory has been increasingly \nused to justify the association of HRM systems with \nhigh performance, the seeds for a diminishing \nrole for employee involvement were set relative \nto emphases on skills and knowledge, labour \nflexibility and extrinsic motivation. This theory \nstresses that organisations achieve competitive \nadvantage through having distinctive, if not \nunique, resources that are not easily imitated \nor substitutable.644,645 It thus sees HRM systems \nas particularly important for generating the \ncompetences of employees, and some even talk of \nthe HRM system itself becoming a unique asset of \nthe organisation, though this is not consistent with \nthe idea of there being a generic type (or types) of \nsystem(s) that should result of high performance.\nThe emphasis on the need for practices to cohere \nif performance is to be optimised remains. The \nargument is, to use the words of Appelbaum et \nal. (2000: 34) \u2018that firms adopting a coherent \nset of workplace practices designed to maximise \nhorizontal fit should have superior performance\u2019. \nThe authors take cohesion to mean that (1) the \nworkplace practices are complementary; (2) \nsynergies exist between the practices leading \nto positive interaction effects on performance; \nand (3) the practices form an integrated system. \nHowever, these meanings are distinct and should \nnot, as Appelbaum et al.13 and others do, be \nconflated. Following Delery646 and Wood and de \nMenezes,647 these should be seen as distinct ways \nof conceiving a horizontal fit. As Wood and de \nMenezes647 outline, a complement of practices \nconsists of all those practices that individually \nhave a positive association with performance. As \nsuch, a complement of high-performance practices \nwould be made up of the practices that are best \nin each of the domains of HRM. Each would add \nsomething unique and not detract from the effect \nof any other. Synergistic practices are those that \nenhance the effect on performance of another. A \nhigh-performance synergistic set would be one in \nwhich all practices interact positively with each \nother, so that the combined use of the practices \nhas \u2018a greater effect on performance than the sum \nof effects of the individual practices\u2019 (Appelbaum \net al. 2000: 134).13 Finally, an integrated approach \nimplies that the practices reflect an underlying \ndistinctive style648 or orientation to HRM, and that \nit is this, and not the particular practices per se, \nthat is really yielding high performance.\nThrough our analysis of individual practices, which \nhas examined the connection between these and \noutcomes, we have identified a set of practices that \nmay be best in each domain. We could, therefore, \ncreate a complementary set on the basis of this. \nHowever, to be certain they are complementary, we \nwould need to ascertain that they have no negative \nimpact on the effect of each other. For example, \nit is often argued that individual performance-\nrelated pay will detract from the positive effects of \nteamwork.\nIn our analysis of individual practices, we reported \nany synergistic relationships between practices. For \nexample, in our review of performance appraisal \nstudies we report two studies that show that goal \nsetting works best when it is participative and \ncombined with adequate feedback.624,625 We have \nnot examined, however, studies that have used \ncomposite measures of HR practice or systems, as \nthose studies typically do not compare the effect of \nindividual practices with those of their composite \nmeasure.\nIn this section, we will introduce and report the \nresults of studies that use composite measures \nof the HR system. We will continue to use our \nmethodological selection criteria that limits our \nsearch to longitudinal, experimental or quasi-\nexperimental studies.\nThe studies are concerned with assessing the \nimpact of a particular system or subsystem of HRM. \nFor example, Freeman and Kleiner649 concentrate \non continuous flow production system, which \nis centred on a time\u2013rate compensation system \ncomplemented by other HR changes, for example \na new safety programme. This is contrasted with \na piecework system in which payment is based \ndirectly on output and the system of production \nis highly individualised. Or in the case of Shipton \net al.650 the central concept is the sophistication of \nHRM.\nThe studies are of two basic types: (1) ones that \nmeasure the system through a composite variable \nbased on the extent of use of a set of practices \nto capture a system \u2013 as in the case of Shipton et \nal.\u2019s650 sophistication of HRM \u2013 and (2) case studies \nbefore and after the introduction of a new system, \nas in Freeman and Kleiner\u2019s649 study of a change \nfrom piecework system to the new continuous flow \nproduction.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The majority were prospective \nlongitudinal studies.21,27,645,649\u2013652 One study37 used \na prospective design, while Schuster653 used a \nretrospective longitudinal design. Finally, one study \nwas a RCT.654\nSome of the studies involved statistical \nanalysis across samples of companies or \nworkplaces,21,27,645,650\u2013652 whereas others involved \nqualitative analysis supplemented by quantitative \nanalysis of a single company.649,652\u2013654\nHRM construct\nNo two studies examined the same concept.\nPerhaps the simplest concept used was the HR \npractice of Wright et al.37 This was measured by \nsimply aggregating the use of nine practices: three \nconcerned with selection and staffing, one with the \nextent of training, three with pay for performance, \nand two with participation \u2013 all measured by a \nsimple binary divide (have or have not).\nIn a similar vein, HRM was the central concept \nof Guest et al.27 It was again measured by an \nindex containing 48 items that covered nine \nareas: recruitment and selection, training and \ndevelopment, appraisal, financial flexibility, job \ndesign, two-way communication, employment \nsecurity and the internal labour market, single \nstatus and harmonisation, and quality.\nShipton et al.650 considered HRM systems in \nterms of their degree of sophistication, which, \nalthough not conceptually defined, was rated by \nan interviewer. Five dimensions were assessed: \nperformance management, recruitment and \nselection, induction, training, and strategy. A \nhigh score on each represents sophistication \nand extensiveness, for example in the case of \nperformance management, not only is there a \nformal appraisal scheme, but also appraisals are \nfrequent, appraisers are trained and it extends to \nall employees.\nWorkman and Bommer654 focus on high-\ninvolvement work processes. Three types of \ninterventions, effectively measuring three degrees \nof high-involvement management, were designed. \nThe type that was the least level of involvement, \nlabelled \u2018alignment job design\u2019, entailed removing \nimpediments to effective motivation and the \nfulfilment of job requirements, but no fundamental \nchanges were made. The practices used were \njob rotation, aligned individual-organisational \nperformance systems, and merit pay and bonus \nschemes. The intermediate group (called \u2018high-\ninvolvement work processes\u2019) involved more \nparticipation, in particular, quality circles, seeded \nby mentors, were introduced and workers were \ngiven participation training to help them adapt \nto an increased level of interdependent working. \nA gain-sharing reward system was introduced \nalongside the merit pay and bonus schemes used in \nthe \u2018alignment job design\u2019. The final intervention \nwas \u2018autonomous work teams\u2019, where the team \nwas self-managed, so responsibilities for problem-\nsolving as well as job design itself were shared. \nParticipation training was given and the group \ndevised a team-based merit pay.\nThe core concept of Rauch et al. (2005: 683)645 \nwas human development and utilisation, which \nis defined in terms of a set of \u2018practices used \nfor enhancing employee skills through training \nand other forms of skill enhancement\u2019. They \nincluded practices such as employee participation, \nempowerment and communication in the other \nforms of skill enhancement.\nIchniowski et al.21 assumed that there is a set of \ninnovative HR practices that are at least applicable \nto traditional manufacturing industries, for \nexample steel. Innovative work practices are: \nincentive pay, high screening in recruitment \nand selection, teamwork, employment security, \nflexible job assignments, high skills training and \ninformation sharing, and line manager\u2013worker \nmeetings on production and other issues. Using \ncluster analysis, Ichniowski et al.21 empirically \nidentified four types of plants: at the two extremes, \n\u2018innovative\u2019 plants used all the labour practices, \nwhereas \u2018traditional\u2019 plants used none of these \npractices. The two intermediate types both had \nteams, in contrast with the traditional system, but \ndiffered in the type of other practices they utilised. \nThe more innovative of the two intermediate types \ndiffered from the high innovative system in that \nit did not tend to have screening in recruitment, \nemployment security or job rotation, while the \nother intermediate type tended only to have \ninformation sharing and line manager\u2013worker \nmeetings. It was having these that differentiated it \nfrom the \u2018traditional\u2019 plants.\nKatz et al.652 reported a similar interplant study, \nbut studied only one firm and focused on a \ncompany-wide quality of work programme, \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n202 TA\nB\nLE\n 5\n4 \nBu\nnd\nle\ns\nSt\nud\ny,\n \nco\nun\ntr\ny\nD\nes\nig\nn,\n s\nam\npl\ne \nsi\nze\n, d\nur\nat\nio\nn\nP\nra\nct\nic\ne(\ns)\n\/in\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\n(s\n);\n \nm\nod\ner\nat\nor\ns\/\nm\ned\nia\nto\nrs\n (\nif \nan\ny)\nO\nut\nco\nm\nes\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne \nm\nea\nsu\nre\n(s\n)\nR\nes\nul\nts\n +\nve\n\/\u2013\nve\nR\nau\nch\n e\nt a\nl. \n \n(2\n00\n5)\n64\n5\nG\ner\nm\nan\ny\nPr\nos\npe\nct\niv\ne \nlo\nng\nitu\ndi\nna\nl\n11\n9 \nen\ntr\nep\nre\nne\nur\ns\n4 \nye\nar\ns\nH\nR\n d\nev\nel\nop\nm\nen\nt \nan\nd \nut\nili\nsa\ntio\nn:\n \nTr\nai\nni\nng\n a\nnd\n d\nev\nel\nop\nm\nen\nt;

The practices used to measure \nthe intensity of the quality-of-work programme \nwere specific to the programme, ranging from \nupward communication programmes to alcohol- or \ndrug-abuse programmes, and also included some \nprocedural elements, for example the use of an \noutside consultant or quality-of-work specialist.\nSchuster653 focused on unionised plants where the \nunion and management had explicitly developed \na cooperative relationship. The concept of \nunion\u2013management cooperation, the impact of \nwhich Schuster653 assessed, reflects the notions of \nKochan about the changes in industrial relations in \nunionised settings in the early 1980s, also reflected \nin Katz et al.\u2019s652 study above, and culminated \nin Kochan\u2019s655 book with Katz and MacKersie, \nThe Transformation of Industrial Relations. In \nSchuster\u2019s653 study there were differences between \nthe novel practices, which varied across the nine \nmanufacturing plants, but they most commonly \ninvolved plant-wide productivity-sharing plans, \nlabour-management committees and work redesign \nprojects.\nFreeman and Kleiner649 contrasted continuous \nflow production with a piecework system, and \nconceptualised both primarily on the basis of their \ncompensation systems, as these were, for them, \n\u2018a central element to any set of human resource \npolicies\u2019 (ibid: 308). Nonetheless, the systems \nentailed complementary practices: piece rates \nwere similar to supervisors who monitored the \nquality output and set rates, while the change to \na continuous flow system included a change in \nthe production system, teamwork, a new safety \nprogramme, as well as time rates. Such a contrast \nin systems is most applicable to shoe and apparel \nmanufacturing, where piece rates have continued \nto be extensively used.\nGomez-Mejia\u2019s651 focus was specifically on \ninternational HR strategy. The measure used was a \nseven-item scale that focused on how HR practice \nis geared to international elements, for example \ninternational experience is highly desirable when \nmanagers are hired or promoted, whereas some \nof the practices included reflect those in the other \nstudies, for example inventive pay, intensive \ntraining.\nOutcomes\nThe range of the outcomes used to test the impact \nof the various core HR constructs was equally large. \nThe only two outcomes assessed in more than two \nstudies were economic; productivity was included \nin six and profitability or financial performance \nin four. Workers\u2019 compensation, a measure of the \nwages bill over sales revenue, was more a measure \nof efficiency than compensation. The other \neconomic outcomes used in the studies, mainly \nin one only, were: quality, shrinkage, operating \nexpenses, employment growth, employment \nstability, innovation in product, processes or \ntechnology, and export performance. Workman \nand Bommer654 used performance measures \nthat were primarily specific to call centres, for \nexample percentage of calls escalated, but also \nused a customer service measure. The other \noutcome measures used were concerned with HR \nor industrial relations measures \u2013 again mainly in \none study only \u2013 and included: labour turnover, \nabsenteeism, organisational commitment, job \nsatisfaction, industrial conflict or disruption, \ncontract demands, negotiation time, employment \nclimate and grievance rate.\nResults\nWright et al.37 showed that HR practices lower \noperating expenses and increase profitability, \nand are also associated with organisational \ncommitment, which Wright et al.37 took to be \nsuggestive of commitment mediating the link \nbetween HR practices and outcomes, although this \nis not formally tested.\nThe results of Guest et al.\u2019s27 study showed a \npositive association between HRM and profitability \nand a negative relationship between HRM and \nlabour turnover. It was not, however, related to \nproductivity. Moreover, when prior profit was \nincluded in the profitability equation, profit was \nno longer significantly associated with HRM. \nThis suggests that profits may well lead to the \nintroduction of HRM not vice versa, this conclusion \nbeing enhanced by the lack of association between \nHRM and productivity.\nShipton et al.650 revealed a positive link between \nsophisticated HRM and innovation in product \nand production technology, but not in process \ntechnology.\nWorkman and Bommer654 showed that the \nintroduction of alignment job design, high-\ninvolvement work processes, and autonomous work \nteams all increased job satisfaction. However, in \nthe case of autonomous work teams, the effect was \nmoderated by the individual\u2019s preference for group \nworking, so autonomous teams were only potent \nfor those with such a preference. In the case of \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n206\nhigh-involvement work processes, this preference \nintensified the positive impact of the processes on \njob satisfaction. Hence, while the job satisfaction \nof all individuals increased, the satisfaction of \nthose with a strong preference for group working \nincreased to a greater extent. However, only high-\ninvolvement work processes were associated with \norganisational commitment. Tests of performance \nshowed that all three systems improved the four \nperformance measures over and above the pre-test \nand control group measures, with the exception \nof one test, which showed that the number of \nproblems resolved by employees was lower in \nautonomous work groups than for any other groups \n(including the control group).\nThe core concept of Rauch et al.,645 i.e. human \ndevelopment and utilisation, was positively \nassociated with the only outcome measure they \nused, namely employment growth. The effect was \nalso shown to be enhanced by the extent of the \nhuman capital of employees in the firm, measured \nby the owner\u2019s perception of whether employees \nwere qualified to do the job.\nIchniowski et al.21 showed that the productivity \nof steel plants was progressively greater as they \nmoved through each of the four categories, from \ntraditional to innovative systems. Innovative \nsystems were the most productive, while the limited \nuse of innovative practices had some pay-offs.\nThe results of Katz\u2019s et al.\u2019s652 analysis of the \nperformance effects of \u2018the quality of work life \nprogramme\u2019 revealed that the extent of the \nprogramme\u2019s adoption was related to product \nquality but not to higher productivity. Its effects \non quality may have been partially mediated by \nits impact on grievance and absence rates (the \ntwo main effects for HR outcomes), which were \nnegatively related to the extent of adoption.\nSchuster653 showed that in six of the nine plants \nstudied, the introduction of the cooperative \nprogramme increased productivity without the \nemployment level being cut. The employment \nlevel was reduced in only one of the plants, and, \nunfortunately, this was the one plant where no \nproductivity data were provided.\nIn contrast, Freeman and Kleiner\u2019s649 case study \nshowed no productivity effects in the change \nfrom the traditional piece work system to a \ncontinuous flow method. However, profitability \nwas improved. The costs of the complementary \npractices associated with piece work, for example \nmonitoring costs or costs involved in changing \nstyles, were greater than those associated with the \nnewly implemented time-based compensation and \ncontinuous flow method. These costs outweighed \nthe productivity gains to be made from piece work, \nso, on balance, the new continuous flow system led \nto an overall better performance.\nGomez-Mejia\u2019s651 study of international human \nresources strategy showed that the extent to which \nthe firm had a strategy was positively associated \nwith export performance.\nOmissions\nThe main omission within the studies that directly \npurport to examine the impact of a HR system is \nthat they did not specify, in any precise way, the \nconcept of HRM underlying their work nor did \nthey develop a clear rationale for the inclusion \nof the practices by which HRM was measured. \nConsequently the main omission from the set of \nstudies is research that systematically defines its \ncore concept and in which the correspondence \nbetween this and its measure is precise. There \nis also an absence of studies that first examine \nthe association between the practices before \nconstructing measures and as part of the \nunderstanding of the reality of the HRM they are \nstudying.\nThere is also a lack of studies that test mediation \neffects, for example whether organisational \ncommitment or job satisfaction mediates the \nimpact of HRM on performance.\nIn the case studies, the practices are determined \nby the situation and in broad terms correspond to \nthe concept of the underlying programme that the \nresearcher is examining, although again in these \ncases more articulation of this concept would have \nbeen useful.\nAll studies are in the private sector and are mainly \nfound in manufacturing settings. Studies of public \nsector and voluntary organisations were not \nidentified by this review.\nSummary\nThe studies taken together showed that HR \npractices do make a difference to performance. \nHowever, limitations in the methods and \nparticularly the measures meant that, in many \ncases, the underlying concept was not clear \nenough for one to say which HR system is (or \nsystems are) really more effective than others. The \nvariety in the studies also limits generalisation. \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

But even in some of the case studies \nthere was insufficient detail of some practices to \nbe certain about what they entailed, most notably \nSchuster\u2019s653 insufficient detail of the changes in job \ndesign in his cases.\nConclusions\nThe literature search to identify studies assessing \nthe impact of HRM practices on intermediate and \nfinal outcomes in non-health-sector settings found \nevidence in nine of the ten categories of HRM \npractices established in Chapter 4. These are:\n\u2022\t work design\n\u2022\t staffing\n\u2022\t training and development\n\u2022\t compensation and rewards\n\u2022\t communication\n\u2022\t family friendly\n\u2022\t employee involvement, representation and \nparticipation\n\u2022\t performance appraisal and performance \nmanagement\n\u2022\t integrated measures.\nWork design has attracted most research attention \naccounting for over 50 of the identified studies. \nOther areas that have been the frequent focus of \nresearch include staffing (23 studies), training \nand development (25 studies), compensation and \nrewards (29 studies) and performance management \n(28 studies). In contrast with this, no evidence was \nfound in the area of single status\/harmonisation. \nThis distribution of studies perhaps reflects the \nfact that the practices studied are in the longer \nestablished and more traditional HRM areas.\nAdditionally, the majority of studies included in \nthis section measure individual level outcomes. \nLess research has looked at final outcomes (i.e. \norganisational performance).\nAs noted in Chapter 7 (Results, Work design), there \nare differences in the types of HRM practice that \nhave been the focus of longitudinal research in \nthe health and non-health sectors. Less research \nattention had been given here to the specific \nstaffing practices of skill mix, staff ratios and \nworking hours. In direct contrast with the health \nliterature this chapter reports on six studies \nexamining the effects of different work schedules \n(such as flexitime, compressed work week and shift \nwork) on various intermediate and final outcomes. \nHowever, the results cannot be presented in an \nadditive manner due to the varied nature of the \npractices and outcomes studied.\nThe review of the health literature identified \nthe heterogeneity of the studies included in the \nreview and that finding is replicated here where \nthe diversity of research topics in terms of HRM \npractices and outcomes measured often make it \ndifficult to develop generalisable conclusions. This \npoint is well-illustrated by the categories of work \ndesign, staffing and training and development \nwhere the HRM practices clearly fell into distinct \nsubcategories.\nThere are some exceptions to this finding, where \nsmall numbers of papers were sufficiently similar to \nallow cumulative conclusions to be made.\nWithin the work design literature, consistent \nevidence has been found for the positive impact \nof increased job control and negative impact of \nhigh demands on employee outcomes, such as \njob satisfaction and absenteeism. Additionally, a \nnumber of concurring studies have established a \npositive link between autonomous team working \nand employee outcomes relating to individual\/team \nproductivity and job satisfaction.\nResearch investigating job rotation, job \nenlargement and job enrichment has concentrated \nmore on the impact of job enrichment alone. \nEnriched jobs have been shown to be linked \nto reduced turnover, and to have a positive \nrelationship with a number of intermediate \noutcomes including job satisfaction, motivation, \ninvolvement and commitment. Studies also \nmostly supported a positive relationship between \njob enrichment and employee performance and \nreduced turnover.\nWithin the literature on staffing, the studies \ninvestigating differing recruitment and selection \ntechniques reported broadly positive impacts of \nthese tools on intermediate outcomes including \nintention to leave, employee productivity, person\u2013\norganisation fit and job satisfaction.\nThe studies across five broad training areas \noffer perhaps the best opportunity to develop \ngeneralisable conclusions. Although diversity was \nfound in the types of training in this category \n(five subcategories) within each of these there was \nImpact of HRM practices in non-health settings\n208\nreasonable similarity between the studies. Studies \nincluding performance and skill enhancement \ntraining provided consistent evidence that this \ntype of training is associated with a range of \npositive outcomes. These are mostly measured at \nthe individual level and often reflect the specific \npurpose of the training. Some of these studies \ninclude limited evidence on final outcomes, such \nas profitability and quality outcomes. Overall, the \nmajority of studies present positive evidence on the \noutcomes specific to the training.\nA group of studies that fall within both the \nperformance management and compensation \nand reward categories looked at the impact of \ngoal setting and feedback and found consistently \npositive results. Goal setting and feedback were \nfound to enhance employee performance, \nparticularly when goal setting is participative. In \nrelation to compensation and rewards, several \nstudies suggest that the effects of goal setting and \nfeedback are enhanced by incentives.\nThe final area in which a consistent set of findings \nwas identified is that of employee participation, \nrepresentation and involvement. Here the majority \nof results support the positive impact of using \nemployee participation when making key decisions \nthat affect them.\nDespite these areas of commonality, the review is \ncharacterised by diversity and a lack of cumulative \ndata. Overall, there are no more than four or five \nstudies in any of the HRM practice categories that \nstudy the same intervention and outcomes. In \naddition, variations in organisational context in the \nnon-health literature make it difficult to know how \ngeneralisable any findings are.\nThese findings point to significant gaps in \nlongitudinal research in all of the HRM practice \ncategories studied. These gaps exist on both the \ntypes of interventions being studied under a given \npractice and also the type of outcomes being \ninvestigated.\nDespite these limitations, the findings do indicate \nsome promising areas and give some indication \nof where the general HRM evidence base could \ninform future practice, policy and research in the \nNHS.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

It first considers findings from the literature \non the relationship between intermediate outcomes \nof HRM practices. It then goes on to look at \nwhat evidence exists for the causal link between \nintermediate and final outcomes. The findings \nreported here specifically address:\n\u2022\t Objective 3: 3.1 What is the evidence on the \nintercorrelations of intermediate outcomes?\n\u2022\t Objective 4: 4.1 What is the evidence for the \nimpact of intermediate outcomes on non-\nhealth final outcomes?\n\u2022\t Objective 4: 4.2 What is the evidence for the \nimpact of intermediate outcomes on patient \ncare outcomes?\nChapter 4 describes the intermediate and final \noutcomes, identified from the HRM literature \nfor inclusion in this review. In Chapter 4 the \nimportance of a third set of variables (salient \nemployee behaviours) was also recognised. In \nrelation to Objectives 3 and 4 this means the \nrelationship between intermediate outcomes and \nsalient productivity related employee behaviours \n(e.g. the association between job satisfaction and \njob performance). Employee behaviours were \ntherefore considered alongside intermediate and \nfinal outcomes. These three groups of variables \nform the basis for the searches undertaken for this \nchapter.\nTwo sources of evidence were identified for this \nsection, their use depending on the research \nobjective:\n\u2022\t Meta-analyses and systematic reviews were \nused to examine the correlations among \nintermediate outcomes and the relationship \nof intermediate outcomes with employee \nbehaviours.\n\u2022\t Individual longitudinal studies (in the \nabsence of any systematic reviews) were used \nto investigate the impact of intermediate \noutcomes on health and non-health final \noutcomes.\nThe chapter first presents methodology and \nfindings from the meta-analyses in relation to \ncorrelations among intermediate outcomes and \nbetween intermediate outcomes and employee \nbehaviours (Objective 3.1). The methodology \nand findings for the longitudinal studies linking \nintermediate with final outcomes are presented \nbelow (see Findings for Objective 4.2 and Findings \nfor Objective 4.1).\nReview methodology\nNo systematic reviews were identified in the \nsearches for Objective 3.1. The methodology in \nrelation to this objective therefore draws exclusively \non meta-analytic reviews. We next provide a brief \ndescription of meta-analysis followed by details of \nthe strategy used to identify and assess relevant \nmeta-analyses.\nOverview of meta-analysis\nMeta-analysis is a powerful tool for summarising \nevidence of a relationship of interest across a \nnumber of studies. Taking the example of job \nsatisfaction and organisational commitment, it \nallows individual studies reporting correlations \nbetween these two intermediate outcomes to be \naggregated to provide an estimate of their true \ncorrelation. Meta-analyses are therefore an effective \nway of quantitatively reviewing the correlations \namong the intermediate outcomes and their \nrelationships with employee behaviours. The \nlarge number of studies reporting correlations \nof interest to Objective 3.1 also points to the use \nof meta-analyses as the best source of evidence. \nFor example, Judge et al.656 reporting on the \ncorrelation between job satisfaction and job \nperformance, carried out a meta-analysis on 254 \nstudies, comprising a sample size of 54,471 for \nall the studies, offering a far better synthesis of \nresearch than non-quantitative methods of review \nwould allow.\nChapter 9  \nIntermediate and final outcomes: \ncorrelations and effects\nIntermediate\u2002and\u2002final\u2002outcomes:\u2002correlations\u2002and\u2002effects\n210\nMeta-analytic search strategy\nA literature search (see example of typical research, \nbelow) was performed to identify meta-analyses \nand reviews on the selected intermediate outcomes. \nFor each intermediate outcome, a search was \nconducted of the following electronic databases: \nMEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Business \nSource Premier. Searches combined a validated \nsearch filter for identifying meta-analyses and \nsystematic reviews (developed in MEDLINE but \ntranslated for the different databases)657 with \na term, or terms, describing the intermediate \noutcome of interest. For example, searches for \noccupational commitment looked for the terms \n\u2018professional\u2019 or \u2018occupational\u2019 and \u2018commitment\u2019. \nSensitive searches were used in order to capture all \npossible papers.\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis or review had to report \ncorrelations between the dependent variable \nand at least one other selected intermediate \noutcome of interest, one of the employee \nbehaviours (e.g. job performance), or a final \noutcome of interest (e.g. patient outcomes, \nprofitability).\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis or review had to report \na corrected correlation coefficient for this \nrelationship. A correlation coefficient corrected \ntakes into account unreliability of the measure \nof the independent variable or sampling error.\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis or review had to report the \nnumber of studies\/samples from which the \ncorrelation coefficient was calculated.\nTwo reviewers independently sifted the results \nof literature searches to identify meta-analyses \nand reviews that satisfied these inclusion criteria. \nReference tracking was also performed on included \nstudies. Informal methods such as contact with \nexperts and purposive searching offered an \nadditional potential source of relevant studies.\nCritical appraisal\nAll meta-analyses and reviews are vulnerable to \ndifferent types of bias or error, which, in turn, \naffect their validity and reliability (see Appendix \n9 for a fuller discussion of bias in meta-analyses). \nMeta-analyses and reviews should aim to use \nmeasures to limit the various potential sources of \nerror or bias that may affect their methodological \nquality and their findings.659 The guidelines and \nreviews evaluating this form of analysis all stress \nthe importance of adequate searches to identify \nrelevant studies, the need for explicit inclusion \ncriteria, and the need to appraise the quality of \nincluded studies.659\u2013662\nThe quality of all included meta-analyses in this \nsection of the review was evaluated using a checklist \ndeveloped for this study (see Appendix 10), based \non currently available checklists663,664 research on \nmeta-analysis61,659\u2013662,665\u2013667 and piloted on meta-\nanalyses included in this review. The checklist was \ndeveloped to assess the efforts made by selected \nmeta-analyses and reviews to limit publication bias, \nselection bias and extractor bias, and to examine \nthe robustness of the results.659,662\nDetails of the assessment of bias of all meta-\nanalyses included in the review can be found \nat Appendix 11. For ease of interpretation, a \nbrief summary of the definitions of correlational \nstrength and assessment of bias is given below.\nTypical search\nDatabase: Ovid MEDLINE <1950 to January Week \n2 2007>\n1 cochrane database of systematic reviews.jn. \n(3984)\n2 meta-analysis.pt.

All rights reserved.\n211\nInterpretation of results\nCorrelations were described as very small (less than \n0.1), small (at least 0.1), medium (at least 0.24 but \nless than 0.37) or large (minimum correlation of \n0.37) based on the guidance of Cohen.668 We use \nthe corrected correlation coefficient from the meta-\nanalyses to assess this.\nThe checklist (Appendix 10) evaluated whether \nthe reported measures taken by the meta-analyses \nincluded in this report made the likelihood of the \ndifferent types of bias or error low, moderate or \nhigh. If the likelihood of publication bias were low, \nfor example, then the quality of this element of the \nmeta-analysis could be said to be high.\nSearch results\nThe search for meta-analyses or systematic reviews \nof intermediate outcomes identified no systematic \nreviews. The number of meta-analyses reporting on \nthe various intermediate outcomes is presented in \nTable 55.\nOverview of quality\nThe failure of all but one of the included meta-\nanalyses to appraise the quality of their included \nstudies lowers their quality and their findings \nshould be accepted with caution. This caution \nshould be enhanced still further in cases where no \nsensitivity or moderator analysis was performed, \nor where there is high publication, selection or \nextractor bias.\nFindings for Objective 3.1\nThe primary aim of Objective 3.1 is to review the \ncorrelations between intermediate outcomes in \norder to establish the extent to which they overlap \nwith each other. So, for example, if we have \nmeasured job satisfaction, what extra information \ndo we get from measuring organisational \ncommitment? In line with the project brief, we \nrestricted our literature search to meta-analyses \nthat assessed intermediate outcomes. However, a \nlarge subset of the meta-analyses of intermediate \noutcomes also assessed one or more productivity or \nperformance-related employee behaviours. Given \nthe importance of these behaviours in the overall \nHRM performance picture (as discussed in Chapter \n4), we felt it important to include them although \nthey are supplementary to the original project \nbrief.\nOne of the intermediate outcomes included in the \nreview is that of climate. Two of the meta-analyses \nincluded in this section of the review examined \npsychological climate. They differed from the other \nmeta-analyses in this section due to the range of \nvariables they covered and the complexity of inter-\nrelationships they examined. Additionally, while \nmost meta-analyses report individual correlations, \nthe climate meta-analyses also report a more \ncomplex model of possible causal pathways, from \nclimate to attitudes to employee behaviours. This \nmeans that they were unsuited to inclusion in the \nsynthesis of meta-analyses. We report findings from \nthe two climate meta-analyses separately for clarity.\nTABLE 55 Results of the meta-analysis search\nIntermediate outcome\nNo. found\n(minus \nduplicates)\nNo. satisfying \ninclusion \ncriteria\nNo. from \nother sources Total\nMotivation 55 1 0 1\nJob satisfaction 121 15 2 17\nOrganisational commitment 40 15 3 18\nProfessional commitment 3 3 0 3\nEngagement 0 0 1 1\nBurnout 37 2 0 2\nJob involvement 8 3 1 4\nTurnover intentions 18 0 0 0\nPsychological contract 0 0 0 0\nOrganisational justice 26 6 0 6\nOrganisational support 0 0 1 1\nOrganisational climate 1 1 1 2\nIntermediate\u2002and\u2002final\u2002outcomes:\u2002correlations\u2002and\u2002effects\n212\nThe findings for the review of Objective 3.1 are \ntherefore described as follows:\n\u2022\t summary of the correlations among the \nintermediate outcomes\n\u2022\t summary of the correlations between the \nintermediate outcomes and employee \nbehaviours\n\u2022\t correlations between climate, other \nintermediate outcomes and employee \nbehaviours.\nCorrelations among \nintermediate outcomes\nTable 56 summarises the corrected correlations \nbetween the intermediate outcomes reported in \nthe meta-analyses. Where there was more than \none meta-analysis reporting the relationship \nbetween two intermediate outcomes, the range of \ncorrelation values from the meta-analyses is shown. \nNo meta-analyses of engagement or psychological \ncontract met the inclusion criteria.\nTable 56 shows moderate to high correlations \nbetween all of the intermediate outcome variables \nwhere data are available. A key objective of the \nbrief for this study was to identify whether each \nintermediate variable identified offered something \ndifferent. The associations between, for example, \njob satisfaction and organisational commitment \n(0.65), although strong, are not of sufficient \nmagnitude to suggest construct redundancy, \nand it is reasonable to conclude that each of the \nintermediate outcomes may contribute to efforts to \nunderstand and manage employee behaviours.\nThe meta-analyses provide the pattern of \ncorrelations that one might expect theoretically \u2013 \nnot only because some of the constructs share some \nconceptual space (e.g. both job satisfaction and \norganisational commitment tap into employees\u2019 \naffective reactions to their jobs and organisations), \nbut also because there are proposed causal linkages \nbetween the intermediate outcomes.\nThe meta-analyses tend to classify variables studied \nin relation to the dependant variables in one of \nthree ways:\n\u2022\t antecedents variables considered to contribute \nthe development of the dependant variable\n\u2022\t correlates variables for which there is not \nconsensus about the causal ordering with the \ndependant variable\n\u2022\t consequences variables considered to be \ninfluenced by the dependant variable.\nSo, for example, Rhoades and Eisenberger208 in \ntheir meta-analysis of organisational support, \nproposed antecedents included organisational \njustice; consequences of organisational support \nincluded job satisfaction, organisational \ncommitment, job involvement, and turnover.

However, the meta-analyses were \nmostly conducted on cross-sectional research. \nAlthough, the meta-analyses provide the patterns \nof correlations that one might predict, the fact that \nwe are dealing with correlations leaves uncertain \nthe causal ordering of the observed associations. \nFor example, organisational justice is predicted \nto be a source of attitudinal outcomes such as \njob satisfaction, but it is likely that perceptions \nof justice are themselves an outcome of attitudes \ntowards work as well as being an antecedent.670 \nThere is a strong likelihood of reciprocal causal \ninfluences between many, if not all, of these \nconstructs.\nA further limitation of the studies should be noted. \nResearch on intermediate outcomes has consisted \nalmost entirely of survey research using self-report \nmeasures. Thus, many of the relationships may \nbe inflated due to common method variance. \nIt has become widely accepted that correlations \nbetween variables measured with the same method \n(e.g. self-report surveys) are possibly inflated due \nthe propensity of the subject to answer similarly \nto multiple items. For example, more optimistic \nor organisationally committed employees rating \na number of intermediate outcomes might \ngive systematically higher scores than their less \noptimistic counterparts.\nAlthough there is uncertainty regarding the causal \nordering among the intermediate outcomes, all are \nproposed to be implicated in the development of \nsalient organisational behaviours (job performance, \nOCB and withdrawal behaviours). We next turn \nto the correlations between the intermediate \noutcomes and individual employee behaviours.\nCorrelations between \nintermediate outcomes and \nindividual employee behaviours\nMeta-analyses were found for relationships between \nall the intermediate outcomes and at least one \nemployee behaviour. The most comprehensive \ndata examined relationships with job satisfaction \nand organisational commitment, which is perhaps \nunsurprising given the long history and enduring \npopularity of these concepts in the research \nliterature. Table 57 summarises the correlations \nbetween the intermediate outcomes and \nperformance-related employee behaviours.\nGenerally, the meta-analyses reported here support \nsignificant, small to moderate relationships, \nbetween intermediate outcomes and individual \nemployee behaviours (positive relationships \nwith job performance and OCB, and negative \nrelationships with withdrawal behaviours). \nHowever, relationships between absence and \nTABLE 57 Corrected correlations between intermediate outcomes and employee behaviours\nM\not\niv\nat\nio\nn\nJo\nb \nsa\nti\nsf\nac\nti\non\nO\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nna\nl \nco\nm\nm\nit\nm\nen\nt\nO\ncc\nup\nat\nio\nna\nl \nco\nm\nm\nit\nm\nen\nt\nJo\nb \nin\nvo\nlv\nem\nen\nt\nT\nur\nno\nve\nr \nin\nte\nnt\nJu\nst\nic\ne \n(d\nis\ntr\nib\nut\niv\ne)\nJu\nst\nic\ne \n(p\nro\nce\ndu\nra\nl)\nO\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nna\nl \nsu\npp\nor\nt\nTurnover \u20130.12 to \n\u20130.26\n\u20130.17 to \n\u20130.29\n\u20130.17 to \n\u20130.21\n\u20130.13 to \n\u20130.16\n0.33 to \n0.38\n\u20130.5 \u20130.46 \u20130.11\nAbsence \u20130.15 to \n\u20130.24\n\u20130.11 to \n\u20130.23\n\u20130.14\nJob performance 0.15 to \n0.3\n0.13 to \n0.30\n0.07 to \n0.22\n0.09 0.13 to \n0.15\n0.36 0.18 to \n0.2\nOrganisational \ncitizenship \nbehaviour\n0.23 to \n0.28\n0.28 0.2 to \n0.32\n0.22 to \n0.25\n0.22 to \n0.27\n0.22 to \n0.28\nIntermediate\u2002and\u2002final\u2002outcomes:\u2002correlations\u2002and\u2002effects\n214\nintermediate outcomes are consistently small, \nquestioning the posited link between absence and \nattitudes. Equally, the correlations between job \ninvolvement and employee behaviours are all weak. \nWhile many of the correlations point towards links \nbetween intermediate outcomes and employee \nbehaviours, it is clear that caution is required in \ninterpreting these results. Some conceptual and \nmethodological problems are illustrated when \nwe consider, for example, the meta-analytic \ncorrelations between job satisfaction and job \nperformance.\nThe relationship between job satisfaction and job \nperformance has been described as the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 \nof occupational and organisational psychologists671 \nand has generated a considerable research \neffort. As Table 57 shows, the strength of the \ncorrelations from the three meta-analyses reported \nin this review vary from small to moderate. The \nmost recent meta-analysis, by Judge et al.656 is \nsuperior in terms of methodological quality to \nany of the other meta-analyses included in this \nreport (see Appendix 11 for quality reviews of \nthe meta-analyses). Examining several hundred \nstudies, Judge et al.656 found an average corrected \ncorrelation between job satisfaction and job \nperformance of 0.3. Although a correlation of \n0.3 qualifies as a \u2018moderate\u2019 effect size using \nCohen\u2019s668 rule of thumb (see Critical appraisal, \nInterpretation of results, above), this result suggests \nthe relationship is a significant one and should be \ntreated as important, given the multitude of factors \nthat may determine job performance.\nHowever, although the correlations might \nencourage an interpretation that job satisfaction \ncauses performance, we cannot determine from \nthese mostly cross-sectional investigations whether \nthis is the case. It appears quite plausible that \nthere is an effect of performance on satisfaction. \nJob satisfaction may be \u2018a response to previous \ngoal-achievement, job effectiveness, and associated \npersonal rewards\u2019 (Warr:672 410). Associated \npersonal rewards may be, for example, increased \npay, recognition and positive feedback, autonomy \nor skill use, with possible ramifications for levels of \njob satisfaction.\nAn additional interpretation of the satisfaction\u2013\nperformance relationship is that additional \nvariables cause both job satisfaction and \nperformance.672 For example, organisational \nsupport might increase job satisfaction while \nalso creating an environment for effective job \nperformance. The correlation between satisfaction \nand performance might be less about a causal \nrelationship and more to do with the influence of \nother factors on both variables.\nThese caveats to the satisfaction\u2013performance \nrelationship generally apply to the other \nintermediate outcome-employee behaviour \ncorrelations in Table 57. The correlations mostly \ndemonstrate significant associations between \nemployee psychological states and important \nemployee behaviours but there is unresolved causal \nambiguity.\nOne further point, given the intermediate \noutcomes are interrelated and therefore each will \nnot have a unique relationship with the employee \nbehaviours, the question arises as to the degree \nto which the above associations with employee \nbehaviours are independent from one another. As \nalready discussed in this section, the association \nbetween job satisfaction and performance may be \npartly accounted for by the association between \norganisational support and performance, or \nthey may be linked in a causal chain, such \nthat job satisfaction plays some part in linking \norganisational support and job performance. This \nmeans that it is not possible to arrive at conclusions \nabout whether an intermediate outcome has a \nunique relationship with employee behaviours.\nCorrelations between climate, \nother intermediate outcomes \nand employee behaviours\nWe next look at two meta-analyses of climate that \nhave attempted to model more than one step in the \ncausal chain between intermediate outcomes and \nemployee behaviours, and have sought to provide \na more complete model of employees\u2019 reactions to \ntheir work environment.\nEmployees\u2019 perceptions of virtually every aspect \nof their work environment have been included in \nclimate research, including the organisation as a \nwhole, senior management, job characteristics, \nsupervisors and co-workers. The picture is \nfurther confused by the overlap of climate \ndimensions with other intermediate outcomes, \nsuch as organisational support, and indeed with \nHRM practices. For example, job characteristics \nperceptions may be included in a climate measure \nand also classified as measure of job design.\nWe report here the results of two climate meta-\nanalyses which have attempted to meaningfully \nclassify the array of climate dimensions.

This procedure is useful for comparing \nalternative explanations for relationships, but \nshould be used with caution. Correlations that are \nbeing compared come from different samples and \npopulations and are not comparable in the same \nway as correlations from the same sample.\nBoth meta-analyses drew upon the model of HRM, \nclimate and productivity proposed by Kopelman et \nal.154 This model proposes that HRM practices in \npart shape organisational climate (comprising goal \nemphasis, means emphasis, reward orientation, \ntask support and socioemotional support). Climate \nrepresents employees\u2019 perceptions of what the \norganisation is like in terms of its policies, practices \nand procedures. The climate in turn impacts \non important individual- and organisational-\nlevel outcomes (e.g. job performance, OCBs and \nwithdrawal behaviours) through the impact it \nhas on cognitive and affective states, such as job \nsatisfaction, work motivation and organisational \ncommitment. The model suggests that HRM does \nnot directly impact on employee psychological \nstates; rather, HR practices are perceptually \nfiltered (i.e. climate) by employees. Subsequent \ncognitive and affective states then mediate the \nrelationship between climate and individual- and \norganisational-level outcomes. Furthermore, \nKopelman et al.154 propose that different climate \ndimensions are related to different cognitive \nand affective states, which, in turn, impact on \ndifferent outcomes. For example, the impact on \nwithdrawal behaviours occurs primarily through \njob satisfaction and motivation, whereas the impact \non job performance occurs primarily through \nmotivation alone.154\nEach meta-analysis adapted the model slightly, \ndepending on the specific climate facets each \nadopted in order to categorise the extensive range \nof climate dimensions they studied.\nCarr et al.673 categorised their wide variety of \nclimate dimensions according to the three facets of \nclimate proposed by Ostroff;675 affective, cognitive \nand instrumental. Affective climate is concerned \nwith interpersonal and social relationships \nbetween employees, and includes the dimensions \nof participation, cooperation, warmth and social \nrewards. Cognitive climate relates to individuals \nand their involvement in work activities, and \nincludes the dimensions of growth, innovation, \nautonomy and intrinsic rewards. Instrumental \nclimate is concerned with task involvement \nand getting things done in the organisation, \nand comprises the dimensions of achievement, \nhierarchy, structure and extrinsic rewards.675 See \nTable 58 for the correlations between the climate \nfacets and intermediate outcomes and employee \nbehaviours reported by Carr et al.673\nCarr et al.673 then tested a series of conceptual \nmodels based on Kopelman et al.\u2019s154 work using \nmeta-analytic path analysis. Figure 5 shows the final \npath model that best represents the data.\nThis model shows differential relationship of \naffective, cognitive and instrumental climate \nperceptions with job satisfaction and organisational \ncommitment. Affective climate has a stronger \nrelationship with organisational commitment than \ndo the cognitive and instrumental facets, while \naffective and instrumental climate perceptions \nhave a stronger relationship with job satisfaction \nthan does cognitive climate. Job satisfaction and \norganisational commitment each have a unique, \nnegative relationship with withdrawal (turnover), \nwhile job satisfaction also has a unique, positive \nrelationship with both job performance and well-\nbeing. This indicates that the relationships between \nTABLE 58 Correlations between dimensions of climate, intermediate outcomes and employee behaviours\nClimate \ndimensions\nIntermediate outcomes and behaviours\nJob \nsatisfaction\nOrganisational \ncommitment\nJob \ninvolvement Motivation\nWell-\nbeing Turnover Performance\nAffective 0.46 0.34 0.17 \u20130.28 0.09\nCognitive 0.33 0.28 0.07 \u20130.07 0.05\nInstrumental 0.44 0.26 0.11 \u20130.33 0.05\nIntermediate\u2002and\u2002final\u2002outcomes:\u2002correlations\u2002and\u2002effects\n216\nCognitive and\naffective states\nJob\nsatisfaction\nOrganisational\ncommitment\nCognitive\nInstrumental\nAffective\nOutcomes\nJob\nperformance\nPsychological\nwell being\nWithdrawal\nClimate\n0.29\n0.26\n0.22\n0.23\n0.15\n0.18\n0.10 \u20130.10\n\u20130.34\n\u20130.15\n0.12\nFIGURE 5 Path model relating climate to outcomes (Carr et al.\u20022003673).

The majority of measures in the \nmodel were obtained via self-report methods, \nthereby potentially inflating the relationships \nreported as a result of common method variance.\nIn contrast with Carr et al.,673 Parker et al.674 \nclassified their wide range of climate dimensions \naccording to the five facets of climate posited by \nJones and James676 concerning work environment \nperceptions, namely job, role, leadership, work \ngroup and organisational characteristics.

Like Carr et al.,673 the authors then \ntested a series of conceptual models based on \nKopelman et al.\u2019s154 work using meta-analytic path \nanalysis. Figure 6 shows the final path model that \nbest represents the data. Parker et al.674 found \nevidence that a general climate factor accounted \nfor the relationship of the five climate dimensions \nwith work outcomes. This is in line with James and \nJames\u2019212 argument that a common judgement \nprocess underlies diverse climate dimensions. This \nprocess is hypothesised to represent an assessment \nof whether the work environment is viewed as \npersonally beneficial or detrimental to one\u2019s well-\nbeing.\nThis model shows an indirect effect of \npsychological climate perceptions on performance, \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The five facets \nof climate have a stronger relationship with \njob satisfaction than with job involvement \nand commitment, while job involvement and \ncommitment have a stronger relationship with \nmotivation than does job satisfaction. However, \nonly job satisfaction also has a direct, positive \nrelationship with performance. This means that \nthe relationship between psychological climate \nperceptions and performance is mediated by job \nsatisfaction, work attitudes and motivation, i.e. \nthat the effects of climate are indirect, occurring \nthrough its relationship with job satisfaction \nand work attitudes and, in turn, through their \nrelationship with motivation.\nAs with the results of Carr et al.,673 and the other \nmeta-analyses reported in this chapter, causal \nrelationships are not proven, and many of the \ncorrelations are potentially inflated.\nIn this chapter, we have so far considered the \nrelationships among the intermediate outcomes \nand the relationships between the intermediate \noutcomes and employee behaviours that may \ncontribute towards organisational performance. \nHowever, organisational performance is not merely \nan aggregate of individual performance. In this \nsection and the next we review the evidence for \nthe impact of intermediate outcomes, such as \njob satisfaction, on health and non-health final \noutcomes (Objectives 4.1 and 4.2).\nFindings for Objective 4.2\nLongitudinal research on \nintermediate outcomes and \npatient outcomes\nResearch question\nDo intermediate outcomes, such as job satisfaction, \nhave an impact on the patient care outcomes of \nIntermediate\u2002and\u2002final\u2002outcomes:\u2002correlations\u2002and\u2002effects\n218\nmortality rates, patient waiting times, patient safety, \npatient satisfaction and patient length of stay?\nMethod\nA systematic search of the literature was conducted \nto identify potential studies to answer this research \nquestion. The following databases were MEDLINE, \nEMBASE, CINAHL, SSCI, PsycINFO, King\u2019s Fund \ndatabase and IBSS. In order to be included, studies \nhave to satisfy the following criteria.\nInclusion criteria\n\u2022\t Longitudinal study design.\n\u2022\t Intermediate outcome related to health \nprofessionals (e.g. job satisfaction among \nnurses or doctors).\n\u2022\t One of the following patient outcomes: \nmortality, waiting times, length of stay, patient \nsatisfaction, patient safety.\n\u2022\t The study must test the causal relationship \nbetween the intermediate outcome and the \npatient care outcome.\nExclusion criteria\nUnpublished dissertations.\nResults and discussion\nThe literature search retrieved the following \nnumbers of unique studies for each of the \nintermediate outcomes (Table 60).\nThe titles and abstracts of all the retrieved studies \nwere independently assessed for inclusion by two \nreviewers. No studies were identified that satisfied \nthe inclusion criteria. Some studies satisfied all but \none of the criteria, and so had to be excluded. For \nexample, non-longitudinal design, by performing \ndata collection of two different types of data at two \ndifferent times (two cross-sectional studies rather \nthan a single longitudinal study),677,678 studying the \nimpact of an intervention on both the intermediate \noutcome and the patient outcome, but not \nassessing the impact of the one on the other679 \nor by considering a patient care outcome not of \ninterest, for example hospital admissions680 or \nadherence to therapy.681 A previous review has also \nnoted the lack of longitudinal studies examining \nthe impact of nurses\u2019 job satisfaction on key patient \noutcomes.682 This lack of evidence has not been \naddressed in the intervening years.\nSummary\nThere is therefore no longitudinal evidence to \nassess whether intermediate outcomes, such as job \nsatisfaction or burnout impacts on the patient care \noutcomes of mortality rates, patient waiting times, \npatient safety, patient satisfaction and patient \nlength of stay.\nFindings for Objective 4.1\nImpact of intermediate \noutcomes on non-health final \noutcomes\nTo identify evidence for the impact of intermediate \noutcomes on final outcomes in the non-health \nsectors, longitudinal studies were searched for to \nprovide stronger evidence of a causal link between \nthe two. The procedure (see Conclusions, below) \nwas repeated here, the only difference being \nthat the variables termed as final outcomes are: \nperformance, productivity or customer outcomes.\nDetails of studies\nSix studies meet the inclusion criteria (Table 61). \nFive of these studies were conducted in the USA \nand one in the UK. Five of these studies have \na prospective longitudinal research design and \none uses a retrospective analysis of a longitudinal \ndata set. The duration of the studies varies from \n12 months to 8 years. Two studies use cross-\nindustry sample, with Schneider et al.683 using data \nfrom 35 companies and Patterson et al.36 reporting \nTABLE 60 Studies for intermediate outcomes and patient outcomes\nIntermediate outcome Records retrieved by searches Records satisfying inclusion criteria\nJob satisfaction 279 0\nBurnout 63 0\nOrganisational commitment 7 0\nProfessional commitment 2 0\nMotivation 25 0\nTurnover intentions 7 0\nClimate 1 0\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The \nstudy by Bernhardt et al.684 uses data from 382 \nrestaurants; Koys685 reports data from 28 stores of \nthe same organisation; Schneider et al.217 collected \ndata from 134 branches of a bank; and Morrow and \nMcElroy686 investigated 31 subunits of a mortgage \nservices company.\nIntermediate outcome variables studied\nFour of the six studies have used employee \nsatisfaction as a predictor variable; other predictor \nvariables used by these studies are organisational \nclimate, service climate, organisational \ncommitment and employee turnover.\nOutcomes\nThe outcomes are customer satisfaction, customer \nperceptions of service quality, and financial \nperformance (profits or market performance), \nproductivity. One study has used organisational \neffectiveness as a final outcome.686\nResults\nJob satisfaction is investigated by four of the six \nstudies. Two studies use prospective longitudinal \nanalysis to explore the impact of job satisfaction on \nfinal outcomes.36,385 Both studies report a positive \nrelationship between job satisfaction and final \noutcomes.\nThe study by Patterson et al.36 also measured \norganisational climate and found that job \nsatisfaction mediated the relationship between \norganisational climate and company productivity. \nEncouragingly, this study shows a similar pattern \nof results to the path models based on meta-\nanalyses of climate and employee performance \nby Carr et al.673 and Parker et al.674 reported below \n(see Conclusions). So, together, these three studies \nfind that employee attitudes (e.g. job satisfaction) \nmediate the relationship between climate and \nperformance at the individual level and at the \norganisational level.\nAcross 28 retail stores, Koys685 found that employee \nsatisfaction was moderately correlated with store \nprofitability in the subsequent year, and strongly \ncorrelated with subsequent customer satisfaction \nratings.\nThe study by Schneider et al.683 used a retrospective \ndesign of employee attitude data over 8 years in up \nto 35 companies to conclude that the relationship \nbetween job satisfaction and organisational \nperformance in cyclical and found stronger \nevidence of reverse causality, i.e. employee attitudes \nare determined by organisational performance. \nThe analysis revealed that overall job satisfaction \nand satisfaction with security were predicted by \nreturn on assets (ROA) and earnings per share \n(EPS) more strongly than the reverse (although \nsome of the reverse relationships were also \nsignificant); satisfaction with pay suggested a more \nreciprocal relationship with ROA and EPS.683\nA fourth study684 uses a longitudinal analysis \nonly between the two final outcomes of customer \nsatisfaction and restaurant performance; it reports \nthe link between job satisfaction and customer \nsatisfaction using a cross-sectional analysis.\nThe fifth study in this group217 used a prospective \ndesign to examine the relationship between \nservice climate and final outcomes. Specifically, it \nexamined the links between employee perceptions \nof service climate and customer perceptions of \nservice quality across 134 bank branches. Survey \nresponses were collected from both employees \nand customers at two time points, approximately \n2 years apart. The results indicated that climate for \nservice led to subsequent customer perceptions of \nservice quality, but that there was also a reciprocal \neffect for customer perceptions and climate.\nThere are two studies that have explored the \nrelationship between customer satisfaction and \nfinancial outcomes, which in the current review \nwe have treated as final outcomes. The study by \nBernhardt et al.684 finds a positive relationship \nbetween customer satisfaction and organisational \nperformance; the study by Morrow and McElroy686 \nfound cost-per-loan efficiency to fully mediate \nrelations between voluntary employee turnover \nand two organisational performance outcomes, \nprofitability and customer satisfaction, in both \nsynchronous and longitudinal analyses. Such \nstudies point to the multiple stages that may lie \nbetween HRM practices and financial performance.\nOmissions\nOther than limited data on the impact of employee \nsatisfaction and climate on final outcomes in the \nnon-health sector, no longitudinal evidence was \nidentified on the impact of intermediate outcomes \non final outcomes.\nSummary\nThere are six studies in this review of longitudinal \nstudies on the link between intermediate outcomes \nand final outcomes. Five of the studies use a \nIntermediate\u2002and\u2002final\u2002outcomes:\u2002correlations\u2002and\u2002effects\n222\nprospective longitudinal research design and one \nstudy uses a retrospective analysis of a longitudinal \ndata set. Four studies have collected data from \nvarious subunits of the same organisation and \ntwo have used cross-organisation data. Four of \nthe six studies examine the relationship between \njob satisfaction and final outcomes; two studies \nexplored the link between climate and final \noutcomes, one looking at general organisational \nclimate, the other at climate for service; the other \nintermediate outcomes in this review have not been \nsubjected to longitudinal investigation in relation \nto final outcomes. Given the few longitudinal \nstudies linking any given intermediate outcome \nwith a final outcome we cannot arrive at any clear \nconclusion about the causal connection between \nthese intermediate and final outcomes.\nConclusions\nThis chapter has covered a wide range of \nresearch, reviewing intercorrelations between the \nintermediate outcomes (Objective 3.1), and the \nimpact of intermediate outcomes on final outcomes \nin both the non-health literature (Objective 4.1) \nand the health literature (Objective 4.2).\nMany, but not all of, the intermediate outcomes \nwere covered by meta-analyses. While there \nremains debate over the value of measuring each of \nthe intermediate outcomes as a separate domain of \nassessment in relation to performance, the strength \nof the correlations does not indicate construct \nredundancy. The significant intercorrelations \nstem not only from some conceptual overlap and \nmostly likely common method variance, but also \nbecause there are causal linkages between the \nconstructs. For example, employee perceptions of \nthe organisation, as embodied in such constructs \nas climate, organisational support and justice, \nare generally proposed to shape motivation and \nemployee attitudes, such as commitment and \nsatisfaction. However, the causal linkages between \nthese domains remain unclear.\nAdditional analyses reviewing the meta-analytic \ncorrelations between the intermediate outcomes \nof HRM and salient employee behaviours \nwere mostly consistent in showing significant \nassociations, although none was large. However, \nto date most research has merely asked about the \nexistence or otherwise of a significant association \nbetween intermediate outcomes and employee \nbehaviours. From this correlational data alone \nwe cannot determine whether one intermediate \noutcome (e.g. high job satisfaction) promoted the \nemployee behaviour (e.g. good work performance), \nwhether behaviours enhanced the intermediate \noutcomes, whether both effects occurred, or \nwhether third variables were causally more \nimportant. Nevertheless, the data do point towards \nthe importance of the intermediate outcomes for \nsalient employee behaviours.\nThere were few meta-analytic data on motivation \nand none on the psychological contract. Both \nconstructs have considerable prominence in the \nHRM and organisational behaviour. In the case of \nthe psychological contract this absence may reflect \nthe concepts relative newness, but also because \nit is an \u2018umbrella construct capturing a range of \nvariables associated with trust, commitment and \nthe exchange of expectations and obligations\u2019 \n(Sparrow:687 15) and, consequently, it has been \noperationalised in many different ways. However, \nthere is little doubt that the psychological contract \nis seen by many commentators as a useful vehicle to \nhelp understand and predict employee behaviour.\nThere were very few longitudinal studies to bring to \nbear on Objective 4.1. In non-health settings there \nwas some limited evidence about organisations\u2019 \naverage job satisfaction, climate and company \nperformance, but very few studies have examined \nboth intermediate and final outcomes on two or \nmore occasions.652 Schneider et al.683 did examine \ndata at multiple time points, albeit on a very small \nsample ranging from only 12 to 35 companies. \nTheir finding of reverse causality between \naverage satisfaction and financial performance \nemphasises the need for caution in making causal \ninterpretations, and also the need for further, more \nrobust research.\nThere were no relevant longitudinal studies \nexamining intermediate outcomes to patient \noutcomes. It is therefore worth noting that there \nare cross-sectional studies on staff intermediate \noutcomes and patient outcomes. For example, \nRobertson et al.688 found that nurse job satisfaction \naveraged at the ward level was related to observed \nstandards of care delivery. Leiter et al.689 found \nthat patients treated on wards where nursing staff \naveraged greater job-related emotional exhaustion \n(a dimension of burnout) were less satisfied with \ntheir nurses, doctors and average quality of care. \nThese investigations are clearly worth pursuing \nwith more substantial longitudinal data sets.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Specifically, it is concerned with \nanswering the following question: What is the \nevidence on the reliability of measures of the \nintermediate outcomes of HRM practices covered \nby this review?\nThe chapter first considers the ways in which the \nproperties of a scale or measure are evaluated. \nThe process of selecting measures of intermediate \noutcomes for the review is described and the \nevidence used in the review is identified. Finally, \nevidence about the reliability of selected measures \nis presented.\nWhat is measurement \nreliability?\nThis review is concerned with self-report measures \nor scales used in survey instruments. Reliability \nis an important aspect of the quality of such \nmeasures. A scale\u2019s reliability refers to how \nconsistently the scale measures a psychological \nfeature or work characteristic. Psychometrics is the \nstatistical process concerned with developing or \nassessing the quality of measurement scales and \nscale reliability is one of the properties by which a \nscale\u2019s quality is rated psychometric.\nMethods of measuring reliability\nThe focus of this part of the review is the reported \nreliabilities of scales that measure the intermediate \noutcomes of HRM practices. Two basic forms of \nreliability exist for self-report instruments: internal \nconsistency and test\u2013retest reliability.\nInternal consistency\nThe internal consistency of a scale indicates the \nextent to which all of the items in the scale are \nbroadly measuring the same phenomenon as each \nother. For example, in a job satisfaction measure, \nthe internal consistency would demonstrate the \nextent to which each item or question in the scale \nis actually measuring job satisfaction (either in \ngeneral or an aspect of it) in the same way as the \nother items in the scale. The most appropriate \nstatistic to assess a scale\u2019s reliability is known as \nCronbach\u2019s alpha and is expressed as a value \nbetween 0 and 1. Cronbach\u2019s alpha is the average \ncorrelation of each item in a scale with all of the \nother items in that scale. For a scale to have good \nreliability (good internal consistency), as a rule of \nthumb it should have a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of at least \n0.7. We have used this measure as the best indicator \nof scale reliability.\nTest\u2013retest reliability\nTest\u2013retest reliability concerns the extent to which \na scale\u2019s measurements are consistent over time. \nIt is not always appropriate but can be helpful in \nassessing how well a measure performs. Hence \nin situations where the work environment (for \nexample) is expected to be stable, test\u2013retest \nreliability of a measure of work environment \n(the correlation between the time 1 and time 2 \nmeasures) should be > 0.7. Equally, in situations \nwhere the work environment is expected to change \n(e.g. in response to HRM practices) test\u2013retest \nreliability can be low. Test\u2013retest reliability is less \nfrequently reported in evaluation articles and is of \nless interest to the current review.\nInter-rater reliability\nA third form of reliability concerns the stability or \nconsistency of a measure when used by different \nraters given the same experiences (inter-rater \nreliability). Inter-rater reliability is important \nwhen results are aggregated and analysed at \nthe organisational level (such as using the mean \njob satisfaction score across all employees in an \norganisation to represent organisational level job \nsatisfaction). It is usually measured by intraclass \ncorrelation (ICC) of which there are two forms. \nICC1 measures the extent to which individuals in a \ngroup agree (the basis for justifying aggregation to \nthe mean is that there is good general agreement \nwithin a group, so a mean score is not hiding \nhigh levels of variation between individuals). \nICC2 assesses the reliability of the mean score \n(approximately this measures the extent to \nwhich the mean scores on a scale for two random \nsubsamples of the same group correlate). While of \nChapter 10  \nMeasuring the intermediate outcomes \nof HRM: the reliability of measures\nMeasuring the intermediate outcomes of HRM\n224\ninterest to the current review, inter-rater reliability \nin the form of ICCs is only relevant to studies using \norganisational level aggregated data, which, as this \nreview has established, are few in number, so it \nhas not been possible to report ICCSs for the data \npresented in this chapter.\nChallenges in reviewing \nreliability\nIn order to review the reliability of a scale, it is \nideal to identify several examples of scale use \nand compare reliability scores from a number of \ndifferent samples. Previous reviews of the reliability \nof measures have highlighted a number of \nchallenges inherent in extracting these data from \nthe social science research literature:49\n\u2022\t inconsistent use of measures although a well-\nestablished measure is cited in the article, the \nauthors may have adapted or deleted items \nfrom the scale or altered response categories \n(sometimes without stating this in the article)\n\u2022\t inaccurate reporting of reliability data reliability \nstatistics are given for the original or some \nhistorical sample rather than the current \nsample in the article\n\u2022\t inconsistent reporting of reliability data in \narticles although scales are used, their \nreliabilities are not reported for the sample.\nThese factors taken together mean that although \nthere might, on the surface, be a large number \nof articles that report using a specific measure, \nthere may in practice only be a limited amount of \ninformation available on the measure\u2019s reliability.\nA further complication for this review is the extent \nto which one-off scales or single items have been \nused to measure concepts of interest. Where a scale \nappears only once in the literature its reliability \nis of relatively limited use in a review such as this. \nSingle items cannot have their reliability assessed \nby the methods described here (as reliability is \nbased on the relationships between items). For \nthese reasons the review developed a pragmatic \nstrategy for identifying relevant evidence, which is \ndescribed below (see Conclusions).\nWhich intermediate \noutcomes is it valid to \nmeasure in this context?\nIn line with the project brief, this review uses \nvalidity to refer to the relevance of measuring \ncertain intermediate outcomes in the HRM \nperformance chain. The intermediate outcomes \nincluded here were first identified in Chapter 4 as \nhaving the most potential in explaining the HRM\u2013\nperformance link. Evidence on the causal links \nbetween HRM practices and these intermediate \noutcomes was then reviewed in Chapters 5\u20137. \nIn the context of this review, those intermediate \noutcomes that have been demonstrated to be \nsensitive to HRM practices are deemed \u2018valid\u2019 to \nmeasure:\n\u2022\t motivation\n\u2022\t job satisfaction\n\u2022\t organisational commitment\n\u2022\t occupational\/professional commitment\n\u2022\t engagement\n\u2022\t burnout\n\u2022\t job involvement\n\u2022\t turnover intentions\n\u2022\t psychological contract\n\u2022\t organisational justice\n\u2022\t organisational support\n\u2022\t climate.\nProcess for selecting specific \nintermediate outcome measures \nfor review\nThe aim is to identify key measures for each \nintermediate outcome domain included in the \nreview. The strategy used is a four-step process:\n\u2022\t First, for each of the above 12 intermediate \noutcomes the specific measures used in the \nstudies were identified. Where an intermediate \noutcome had a single scale associated with it, \nor if there were any scales predominantly used \nin the health literature, these would be selected \nfor the review of reliability. This exercise \nrevealed that for a number of intermediate \noutcomes no single scale emerged as the main \nor preferred measure. In some instances, the \nmeasure used was a one-off, designed by the \nresearchers or was simply not specified at all. \nIn other cases a number of specific measures \nwere each used by one study or a small number \nof them. In these cases, expert opinion was \nused to select the best-established measures.\n\u2022\t Second, where an intermediate outcome area \nwas not covered by the studies included in \nthis review (as is the case with psychological \ncontract) or the measure identified in this \nreview was felt to be too specific for general \nuse (as with climate for creativity and \ninnovation) the subject experts on the research \nteam identified an appropriate measure for \ninclusion.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n225\n\u2022\t Third, for each of the included measures, a \nrecent review of reliability data was sought. One \nevidence source was invaluable in this: Taking \nthe Measure of Work \u2013 a guide to validated scales \nfor organisational research and diagnosis201 \nprovides a comprehensive review, drawing on \nall papers using validated measures published \nin 15 top organisational research journals over \nthe period 1990\u20139.\n\u2022\t Fourth, for the intermediate outcomes not \ncovered by Fields\u2019 review201 a search was \nundertaken for reviews of reliability for scales \nmeasuring the intermediate outcome. If no \nreview of scale reliability could be identified \nthen purposive searching was undertaken \nfor a meta-analysis or longitudinal study to \nsupplement the data presented here. Meta-\nanalyses were also used where conceptual \nuncertainty existed around a measure. The \naim of this search was to identify reliability \ndata for the selected measures and to \nhighlight if there were other well-established \nmeasures for any of the outcomes that had not \nalready been covered in the review. In some \ninstances intermediate outcomes had only \nbeen studied in cross-sectional research, so \nno example scales were covered in this review. \nHowever, these intermediate outcomes had \nbeen identified by the expert panel as being \ntheoretically important and were thought \nto have demonstrable links with important \nemployee behaviours such as job performance \nand staff turnover.\nThe remainder of the chapter presents evidence \non scale reliabilities for measures of intermediate \noutcomes of HRM practices identified earlier in \nthe report. For each intermediate outcome, the use \nof scales in the review is summarised and the main \nscale used to measure that outcome is descibed. \nItems and response categories are given and \nreliability data reported.\nReliability of intermediate \noutcome measures\nMotivation\nFive studies reported using measures of motivation \nas an outcome of HRM practices. Three studies \neach used a different established scale, one study \nused the researchers own scale and one study did \nnot specify the measure of motivation. Of the three \nestablished measures, one was developed in the \nUK475 and is presented here. A second measure, \nwhich includes a subscale of work motivation (the \nJDS), is reported below (see Job satisfaction).\nEstablished scales used in the review:\nWarr et al. (1979):475 Intrinsic Job Motivation\nScale description\nThis is a six-item scale measuring intrinsic job \nmotivation, i.e. the degree to which an employee is \nmotivated to perform well in his\/her current job in \norder to be intrinsically satisfied. The scale is taken \nfrom Warr et al.\u2019s475 Work and Life Attitudes Survey.\nItems and response category\n\u2022\t \u2018I feel a sense of personal satisfaction when I do \nthis job well.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018My opinion of myself goes down when I do \nthis job badly.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I take pride in doing my job as well as I can.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I feel unhappy when my work is not up to my \nusual standard.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I like to look back on the day\u2019s work with a \nsense of a job well done.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I try to think of ways of doing my job \neffectively.\u2019\nEach item is rated on seven-point Likert-type scale, \nwhere 1 = no, I strongly disagree, 2 = no, I disagree \nquite a lot, 3 = no, I disagree just a little, 4 = I\u2019m \nnot sure about this, 5 = yes, I agree just a little, \n6 = yes, I agree quite a lot, and 7 = yes, I strongly \nagree.\nReliability\nA coefficient alpha value of 0.65 for test\u2013\nretest reliability, based on 60 participants, was \nreported.475\nOne review of measures of motivation was \nidentified.690 This does not include the Warr et al.475 \nmeasure, nor does it provide scale reliabilities for \nthe measures it identifies. Eleven measures of work \nmotivation are listed (including the JDS).\nJob satisfaction\nJob satisfaction was the most widely measured \nintermediate outcome in the review. Over 50 \nstudies reported data using 17 different measures. \nMeasures differ in the sense that they either \nmeasure overall satisfaction (e.g. with items such as \n\u2018in general, I like working here\u2019) or they measure \nsatisfaction with individual facets of a job (e.g. \npay, autonomy, supervision), which can then be \ncombined to give an overall satisfaction score. \nMeasuring the intermediate outcomes of HRM\n226\nThe measures commonly used in studies in this \nreview all measure satisfaction with facets of the \njob to some degree. Additionally, some measures \ndistinguish between intrinsic satisfaction (job \ncontent) and extrinsic satisfaction (rate of pay and \nsecurity).475\nFour measures emerge as the most commonly used \nin this type of research:\n\u2022\t \u2018My own feelings generally are not affected \nmuch one way or the other by how well I do on \nthis job.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018Most people on this job feel a great sense of \npersonal satisfaction when they do the job well.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018Most people on this job feel bad or unhappy \nwhen they find that they have performed the \nwork poorly.\u2019\nResponses for the items in the general and work \nmotivation subscales are scored on a seven-point \nLikert scale: 1 = disagree strongly, 2 = disagree, \n3 = disagree slightly, 4 = neutral, 5 = agree slightly, \n6 = agree, and 7 = agree strongly.\nSatisfaction with opportunities for \ngrowth\n\u2022\t \u2018The amount of personal growth and \ndevelopment I get in doing my job.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018The feeling of worthwhile accomplishment I \nget from doing my job.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018The amount of independent thought and \naction I can exercise in my job.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018The amount of challenge in my job.\u2019\nFacet-specific items\n\u2022\t Security\n \u2013 \u2018the amount of job security I have\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018how secure things look for me in the \nfuture in this organisation\u2019.\n\u2022\t Compensation\n \u2013 \u2018the amount of pay and fringe benefits I \nreceive\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018the degree to which I am fairly paid \nfor the amount I contribute to this \norganisation\u2019.\n\u2022\t Satisfaction with co-workers\n \u2013 \u2018the people I talk to and work with on my \njob\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018the chance to get to know other people \nwhile on the job\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018the chance to help other people while at \nwork\u2019.\n\u2022\t Satisfaction with supervisor\n \u2013 \u2018the degree of respect and fair treatment I \nreceive from my boss\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018the amount of support and guidance I \nreceive from my supervisor\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018the overall quality of the supervision I \nreceive in my work\u2019.\nThe response categories for growth satisfaction \nand facet-specific satisfaction are: 1 = extremely \ndissatisfied, 2 = dissatisfied, 3 = slightly dissatisfied, \n4 = neutral, 5 = slightly satisfied, 6 = satisfied, and \n7 = extremely satisfied.\nHackman and Oldham (1974):195 Job Diagnostic \nSurvey (JDS)\nSmith et al.

(1979):475 Job Satisfaction Questionnaire\nThe most commonly used measure was JDS. The \noverall and facet-specific job satisfaction scales of \nthe JDS form part of a larger questionnaire that \nwas first developed in the early 1970s. The full \nJDS measures a range of different aspects of work \nincluding motivation, job characteristics. The job \nsatisfaction and work motivation subscales are \nreported here.\nScale description\nThis is a 25-item measure consisting of four \nsubscales: overall satisfaction; internal work \nmotivation; growth satisfaction; and satisfaction \nwith specific facets of the job.

(1982):173 Shortened OCQ\nMeyer and Allen (1984):477 Affective Commitment\nThe shortened Organisational Commitment Scale \nis presented here.\nScale description\nThis is a nine-item scale measuring the extent \nto which an individual accepts or shares the \norganisation\u2019s goals, is prepared to exert effort on \nthe part of the organisation and wishes to maintain \nmembership of the organisation.\nItems and response categories\n\u2022\t \u2018I am willing to put in a great deal of effort \nbeyond that normally expected in order to help \nthis organisation to be successful.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I talk up this organisation to my friends as a \ngreat organisation to work for.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I would accept almost any type of job \nassignment in order to keep working for this \norganisation.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I find that my values and the organisations \nvalues are very similar.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I am proud to tell others that I am part of this \norganisation.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018This organisation really inspires the very best \nin me in the way of job performance.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I am extremely glad that I chose this \norganisation to work for over others I was \nconsidering at the time I joined.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I really care about the fate of this organisation.\u2019\nBlau (1985):691 The Career Commitment Scale\nScale description\nThis is an eight-item measure of occupational \ncommitment developed with nursing staff in a \nNorth American hospital. In this context, career \ncommitment is defined as one\u2019s attitude towards \none\u2019s profession or vocation.691\nItems and response category (slightly abbreviated \nscale items are reported here as they appear in the \noriginal article).\n\u2022\t \u2018If I could get another job different from being \na nurse and paying the same amount I would \nprobably take it.\u2019*\n\u2022\t \u2018I definitely want a career for myself in \nnursing.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018If I could do it all over again, I would not \nchoose to work in the nursing profession.\u2019*\n\u2022\t \u2018If I had all the money I needed without \nworking, I would probably still continue to \nwork in the nursing profession.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I like this vocation too well to give it up.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018This is the ideal vocation for a life work.\u2019\nMeasuring the intermediate outcomes of HRM\n228\n\u2022\t \u2018I am disappointed that I ever entered the \nnursing profession.\u2019*\n\u2022\t \u2018I spend a significant amount of personal time \nreading nursing-related journals or books.\u2019\n(*Indicates that the item is reverse scored.)\nThe scale uses a five-point response category, which \nBlau691 describes as ranging from 1 = strongly \ndisagree to 5 = strongly agree.\nReliability\nBlau691 reports a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.87 for \nthe career commitment scale. A second sample \n(consisting of roughly one-half repeat respondents \nand one-half new respondents) gave a Cronbach\u2019s \nalpha of 0.85. Fields201 reports alphas of 0.76\u20130.88 \nfrom five studies using the measure.\nEngagement\nNone of the studies in the current review measured \nengagement, so no specific scales were identified \nthis way. The literature search was also unable to \nidentify any reviews of the reliability of a measure \nof engagement. This section therefore draws on \nevidence from a single study on the development \nof a short measure of engagement, which has been \nwidely used in cross-sectional research on HRM:\n \u2013 \u2018When I get up in the morning, I feel like \ngoing to work.\u2019\n\u2022\t Dedication\n \u2013 \u2018I am enthusiastic about my job.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018My job inspires me.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018I am proud of the work that I do.\u2019\n\u2022\t Absorption\n \u2013 \u2018I feel happy when I am working intensely.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018I am immersed in my work.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018I get carried away when I am working.\u2019\nResponse category\nAll items are rated on a seven-point Likert-type \nscale, where 0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = rarely, \n3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often, and \n6 = always.\nReliability\nCronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients ranged between 0.60 \nand 0.88 (median = 0.77) for the three-item vigour \nsubscale, between 0.75 and 0.90 (median = 0.85) \nfor the three-item dedication subscale, and between \n0.66 and 0.86 (median = 0.78) for the three-item \nabsorption subscale.692 Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the \nwhole nine-item measure varied between 0.85 and \n0.92 (median = 0.92).692\nCoefficients for test\u2013retest reliability were \n0.61, 0.56 and 0.60 for the subscales of vigour, \ndedication and absorption, respectively, based on a \nsample of 293 participants, and 0.71, 0.66 and 0.68 \nfor each of the subscales, respectively, based on a \nsample of 2111 participants.\nCoefficients for test\u2013retest reliability for the whole \nnine-item measure were 0.64 and 0.73, based on \nsamples of 293 and 2111 participants, respectively.\nBurnout\nThirty studies included a measure of emotional \nstrain. A wide range of concepts were covered by \nthe studies including negative emotions, stress, \nexhaustion, irritation, anxiety, self-esteem and \npsychosomatic complaints. There was also great \nvariation in the measures used; however, the \nMaslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was the most \nfrequently reported (four studies):\nSchaufeli et al.

There has been a tendency in research \nstudies to use only the frequency measure.\nReliability\nMany studies have used the MBI and reviews of \nthese typically report Cronbach\u2019s alphas of 0.74\u2013\n0.89 for the three subscales.695\nOther measures of burnout\nResearch into burnout has largely been dominated \nby use of the MBI. One review of measures of \nburnout was identified697 in which two other scales \nare reviewed.\nJob involvement\nFour studies include a job involvement measure \nas an outcome of HRM. Two studies reported \nusing Lodahl and Kejner424 and one study used a \nmeasure by Kanungo.593 The fourth study did not \nspecify the scale used.\nNo reviews of the reliability of job involvement \nmeasures were identified. A meta-analysis of job \ninvolvement189 established that the two scales \ncited here tended to measure the same concept \nand that there were no substantive differences in \nrelationships with other associated variables (e.g. \njob satisfaction). The more recent Kanungo593 scale \nis reported here.\nKanungo (1982):593 Job Involvement Questionnaire \n(JIQ)\nScale description\nThis is a 10-item scale to describe an employee\u2019s \nspecific beliefs regarding his\/her relationship with, \nor involvement in, his\/her current job.\nExample items\n\u2022\t \u2018The most important things that happen to me \ninvolve my present job.\u2019\nMeasuring the intermediate outcomes of HRM\n230\n\u2022\t \u2018To me, my job is only a small part of who I \nam.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I am very much involved personally with my \njob.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I live, eat and breathe my job.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018Most of my interests are centred around my \njob.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I have very strong ties with my present job \nwhich would be very difficult to break.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018Usually I feel detached from my job.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018Most of my personal life goals are job-\noriented.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I consider my job to be very central to my \nexistence.\u2019\n\u2022\t \u2018I like to be absorbed in my job most of the \ntime.\u2019\nResponse category\nEach item is rated on six-point \u2018agree\u2013disagree\u2019 \nLikert-type scale.\nReliability\nCoefficient alpha values for the JIQ, as calculated \nby Kanungo,593 were 0.87 for internal consistency \n(based on 703 participants) and 0.85 for test\u2013retest \nreliability (based on 63 participants).\nTurnover intentions\nOver 50 of the studies in this review included some \nform of absence, turnover or turnover intention \nmeasure. In 36 cases, a one-off or unspecified scale, \nor company records were used. The remaining \nstudies cited 10 different scales, the most frequently \ncited being the Intention to Quit subscale of the \nMichigan Organisational Assessment Questionnaire \n(used in three studies).\nNo reviews of the reliability of turnover intention \nscales were identified.\n\u2022\t \u2018I will probably look for a new job in the next \nyear.\u2019\nResponse category\nItem 1 is rated on a seven-point Likert-type scale, \nwhere 1 = not at all likely, 2 = somewhat likely, \n3 = quite likely, and 7 = extremely likely.\nItems 2 and 3 are rated on a seven-point \nLikert-type scale, where 1 = strongly disagree, \n2 = disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 = neither agree \nnor disagree, 5 = slightly agree, 6 = agree, and \n7 = strongly agree.\nReliability\nA coefficient alpha value of 0.83 is given based on a \nsample of more than 400 participants.619\nPsychological contract\nNo studies measuring psychological contract were \nfound in the review of longitudinal studies. Equally, \nno review of psychological contract scales was \nidentified in the literature.

Fields, in his review of \nthe measure, reports coefficient alpha values from \nthree studies, ranging from 0.74 to 0.95.\nOther measures of organisational \nsupport\nNo other measures of organisational support were \nidentified.\nOrganisational climate\nMeasuring organisational climate is especially \ncomplex due to the multifaceted nature of the \nconcept. A wide range of dimensions can be \ncovered in a generic climate model, and there \nis little consensus about which dimensions it is \nimportant to measure. Measures of organisational \nclimate typically adopt one of two distinct \napproaches. First, the molar approach that looks \nat employees\u2019 perceptions of a variety of formal \nand informal practices, policies and procedures in \nan organisation. The two meta-analyses reported \nin Chapter 8 adopt this broad approach to climate \nmeasurement. However, there is no consensus \nabout which climate measures should be included. \nExisting climate measures cover a vast number and \nvariety of dimensions with little consensus as to the \nareas of organisational functioning that should be \ncovered.\nSecond, facet-specific approaches try to identify \na few key elements of climate that are relevant \nto the specific research question and use a small \nnumber of scales to measure those relevant climate \ndimensions. There is emerging evidence to suggest \nthat specific climates (e.g. safety, innovation, \ncustomer service) are important in predicting \nspecific organisational outcomes. In particular, in \nthe health sector, safety climate has emerged as a \nprominent area of research in relation to patient \noutcomes.\nOne measure of climate was identified in the \nstudies included in the review, the facet-specific \nmeasure of creative and innovative climate.251 This \nwas felt to be too specific to be of general use so is \nnot included here.\nThe literature review identified two meta-analytic \nreviews of molar climate measures;673,674 two recent \nstudies of climate in health-care settings;701,702 and \none review of safety climate in health care.703 Both \nof the studies in health-care settings support the \nimportance of safety climate in determining patient \nsafety outcomes (including medication errors).\nThe review of Flin et al.703 examines the \npsychometric properties of 12 measures of safety \nclimate and concludes that the Hospital Survey \non Patient Safety has undergone more rigorous \ntesting than other measures and met more of their \npsychometric criteria. The scale is reported here.\nSorra and Nieva (2003):704 Hospital Survey on \nPatient Safety\nMeasuring the intermediate outcomes of HRM\n234\nConclusions\nScales for nine of the intermediate outcomes were \nidentified in the studies included in this review. \nTwo intermediate outcomes domains (engagement \nand psychological contract) were not covered in the \nstudies included in this review. However, they were \nfelt to be conceptually important areas (particularly \nfor future research) and measures were identified \nvia expert opinion. In one area, climate, the only \nmeasure used in an included study was felt to be \ntoo specific to an area (creativity) for general use \nin studying the effects of HRM. Again the subject \nexperts on the team identified alternative climate \nmeasures that are of theoretical interest in an NHS \nsetting.\nAn extensive review of validated measures of a \nrange of work-related variables (Fields201) was used \nas the primary source of information for five of \nthe intermediate outcome areas (job satisfaction, \norganisational commitment, occupational \ncommitment, organisational justice and \norganisational support). For the remaining seven \nareas, reviews of scale reliabilities were sought, \nand where none could be found we drew on meta-\nanalyses or empirical studies to provide some data \non reliability and other scales.\nThe studies included in this review used a wide \nrange of scales within most of the intermediate \noutcome areas, while in other areas a far smaller \nnumber of scales, or no scales were found. \n \u2013 \u2018Staff are afraid to ask questions when \nsomething does not seem right.\u2019*\n\u2022\t Feedback and communication about error\n \u2013 \u2018We are given feedback about changes put \ninto place on event reports.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018We are informed about errors that happen \nin this unit.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018In this unit, we discuss ways to prevent \nerrors from happening again.\u2019\n\u2022\t Non-punitive response to error\n \u2013 \u2018Staff feel like their mistakes are held \nagainst them.\u2019*\n \u2013 \u2018When an event is reported, it feels like \nthe person is being written up, not the \nproblem.\u2019*\n \u2013 \u2018Staff worry that mistakes they make are \nkept in their personnel file.\u2019*\n\u2022\t Staffing\n \u2013 \u2018We have enough staff to handle the \nworkload.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018Staff in this unit work longer hours than is \nbest for patient care.\u2019*\n \u2013 \u2018We use more agency\/temporary staff than \nis best for patient care.\u2019*\n \u2013 \u2018We work in \u201ccrisis mode\u201d, trying to do too \nmuch, too quickly.\u2019*\n\u2022\t Hospital management support for patient \nsafety\n \u2013 \u2018Hospital management provides a work \nclimate that promotes patient safety.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018The actions of hospital management show \nthat patient safety is a top priority.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018Hospital management seems interested in \npatient safety only after an adverse event \nhappens.\u2019*\nSafety culture dimensions \u2013 hospital \nwide\n\u2022\t Hospital hand-offs and transitions:\n \u2013 \u2018Things \u2018fall between the cracks\u2019 when \ntransferring patients from one unit to \nanother.\u2019*\n \u2013 \u2018Important patient care information is \noften lost during shift changes.\u2019*\n \u2013 \u2018Problems often occur in the exchange of \ninformation across hospital units.\u2019\n \u2013 \u2018Shift changes are problematic for patients \nin this hospital.\u2019*\n(*Indicates the item is reverse scored.)\nResponses are measured on a five-point Likert-type \nscale, where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, \n3 = neither, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.\nSupervisor\/manager expectations and actions pro-\nmoting safety: Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.75\nCommunication openness: Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.72\nFeedback and communications about error: \nCronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.78\nNon-punitive response to error: Cronbach\u2019s \nalpha = 0.79\nStaffing: Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.63\nHospital management support for patient safety: \nCronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.83\nHospital handoff and transitions: Cronbach\u2019s \nalpha = 0.80\nReliability\nSorra and Nieva704 report reliabilities for the scales \nas follows:\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Since \nthe earliest studies in the USA by researchers \nsuch as Arthur14,648 and Huselid,18 many \ncommentators have concluded that the evidence \nof the performance benefits of effective HRM \nis increasingly strong. As Marchington and \nZagelmeyer705 note, a number of reports in the \nUK have stated that the economic and business \ncase for good people management is now proven. \nFor example, in the UK, the CIPD706 reported \nthat \u2018more than 30 studies carried out in the \nUK and the USA since the early 1990s leave no \nroom to doubt that there is a correlation between \nbusiness management and performance, that the \nrelationship is positive, and that it is cumulative\u2019 \n(CIPD 2001:706 4). However, there is not unanimity \nabout the strength of the evidence and judgements \nvary as to the extent to which the case is proven. \nMore considered reviews of the evidence suggest \nthat it is too early to be conclusive about the effects \nof HR practices on performance.30 Hence the \ncurrent review is a timely assessment of the nature \nand strength of the evidence linking HRM to \nperformance.\nSystematic review \nmethodology\nPrevious reviews on the evidence base for the \nHRM performance link have been conducted \nwith varying degrees of adherence to systematic \nprinciples, but none has followed the protocols of \nsystematic review methodology. There is no real \ntradition of using this approach in the HRM field \nand their use more generally in organisational \nbehaviour and management areas has only recently \nemerged. Such reviews are still limited in number.\nSystematic review methodology offers the most \nsophisticated means of identifying and synthesising \nlarge amounts of evidence from disparate \nsources, as is the case in the HRM literature. \nThe HRM topic itself, however, presented \nseveral challenges often not encountered in \nmore limited and clearly demarcated reviews, \nsuch as those in many areas of medicine where \nthe methodology was first developed. Specifying \nand defining the interventions and outcomes \nto be studied was particularly complicated, and \nconsequently developing inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria and a robust means of synthesis was not \na straightforward matter. As a result, this report \npresents an assessment of the evidence in relation \nto a wide range of HRM practices, rather than \nan in-depth appraisal and synthesis of findings \ninvolving a few well-defined practices. There are \ntwo methodological principles that have guided the \nreview:\n\u2022\t The review is, in the main, concerned with \ncause and effect and, therefore, mostly restricts \nitself to the type of evidence capable of \nproviding causal explanations.\n\u2022\t The review adopts a broad and inclusive \napproach to the assessment of evidence in \norder to reflect the complex and diverse nature \nof the HRM literature.\nGiven the multiple research questions this review \nsought to answer, along with the breadth of some \nof the research questions and the time limitations \non the project, we did not attempt a coverage of all \nliterature relevant to HRM, such as that on culture, \nstrategy and leadership, but these concepts are \nincluded where they are directly tied to the HRM \npractices reviewed (e.g. leadership training).\nIdentification of HRM \npractices\nAn immediate challenge for the research team was \nthat of marshalling the diverse\/diffuse terminology \nwithin HRM into categories that could be used \nconsistently throughout the review. Practices were \nidentified using three different methods:\n\u2022\t a review of reviews\n\u2022\t expert opinion\n\u2022\t all practices identified from the subsequent \nliterature searches were then mapped back \non to the categories created by the first \ntwo methods, to test their coverage and \ninclusiveness.\nChapter 11  \nConclusions and recommendations\nConclusions and recommendations\n238\nTwo researchers independently undertook \nreciprocal translation on the HRM practice \nterms in order to test the equivalence of themes \nacross different research papers. This quickly \ndemonstrated the diversity of approaches and \ndefinitions within the HRM literature, and led us \nto adopt a search strategy based on broader terms \nsuch as HRM and personnel management.\nOn the one hand, the implications for this review \nare that by adopting a broad search strategy, the \nevidence collected is an accurate reflection of the \ndiversity of research within HRM, but is more \ndifficult to distil into a few key messages. On \nthe other hand, as in any review, some relevant \nresearch studies may not have been identified, \nparticularly in this case if they did not include \nHRM, personnel management, or an equivalent \nterm in the title or abstract and were not identified \nvia citation searching or reference tracking.\nRange and fidelity of use of \nHRM practices in the UK\nObjective 1 for the research is concerned with \nidentifying the main methods of HRM practices, \nthe extent of their use in UK organisations, and \nthe degree to which HRM policy is implemented. \nInitial work to identify the main methods of \nHRM identified 10 broad categories of practice\/\nintervention. These were then searched for in high-\nquality HRM surveys in the UK. Several surveys \nwere identified that examined the range of HRM \npractices being used in organisations in the UK. Of \nthese, the WERS in particular is an excellent source \nof data on the extent of use of practices, providing \nsome data on each of the broad categories of HRM \npractice. The majority of categories of practice \nidentified in this review are also reported in surveys \nas present in over 70% of UK workplaces. However, \nwithin an individual workplace the extent of their \nuse may vary as they may not be used for all staff.\nNot all specific practices in each broad category \nused in this review are measured. For example, \na survey might measure some aspects of work \ndesign, for example job autonomy, but not others, \nfor example role breadth. Hence, the range of \napproaches to HRM practices within each broad \ncategory of HRM activity is unknown. Separate \ninformation for the health sector is sparse and \npoints to the need for better monitoring of HRM \npractices used in the NHS and elsewhere in the \nhealth sector. WERS uses standard industrial \nclassification (SIC) codes that allows further \nbreakdown of the data by sector. It is recommended \nthat further analysis of this database is undertaken \nto provide more detailed information about the use \nof HRM in the health sector that this permits.\nThe categories of HRM practices, work design \nand staffing, training, employee involvement and \nperformance management, which we have found to \nbe most consistently associated with positive patient \noutcomes in the health sector have also been shown \nby the data in WERS to have good coverage in \nboth health and non-health sectors. However, the \ninformation on them is not as deep as one would \nideally like, as we do not have strong information \non the variety of forms that each HRM practice \nmay take. Such variations may lead to differences in \ntheir effects and durability.\nAdditionally, there is a need for awareness \nabout the potential gap between intended HRM \npractices and actual or implemented practices. \nSocial policy research has shown that the extent \nof implementation fidelity may affect whether \na practice has its desired impact. However, no \ngeneric measure of implementation fidelity exists \nand there is little consistency in its measurement in \nthe social policy area. Within HRM, some studies \ndo gauge whether policies and practices have \nbeen implemented as they should be (e.g. reduced \nhours working, and monitoring and feedback), \nbut, on the whole, the fidelity with which HRM \npractices are implemented is rarely measured in \nthe research. However, only by evaluating whether \na practice has been implemented properly can we \nassess whether any lack of impact is due to poor \nimplementation or the inadequacies of the practice \nitself. Without assessing fidelity, it is also unclear \nwhether any positive outcomes produced could \nbe improved still further by increasing fidelity to \nthe original model. Implementation fidelity has \nthen to be considered as a potential moderator \nof outcomes, i.e. a variable that can influence the \nrelationship between an HRM practice and its \noutcome.\nConsequently, implementation fidelity needs to \nbe measured and this report offers a framework \nand guidance for understanding and evaluating \nthe fidelity in practice. A major implication for \nthe findings of this review is that it is unclear \nwhether variations in outcome or inconclusive \nfindings are due to methodological weaknesses \nin which researchers have failed to distinguish \nbetween HRM policies as intended and HRM \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The recommendation here is \nfor better methodological rigour in the assessment \nof implementation fidelity within HRM and \nperformance research.\nEvidence for the link \nbetween HRM practices and \nintermediate outcomes in \nthe health sector\nIntermediate outcomes are the intended outcomes \nof HRM practices, such as attitudes that may act \nas a link between HRM and final outcomes such as \npatient care. Longitudinal studies examining the \nrelationship between HRM and such outcomes in \nthe health field were identified by two strategies. \nFirst, a broad search for HRM and any outcome, \nwith no limitations set in the search terms of type \nof outcome or setting, was undertaken. Second, a \nmore specific search of the link between HRM and \npatient outcomes was conducted.\nLongitudinal studies were found to exist for only \n5 of the 12 intermediate outcomes identified \nfor inclusion in the review. No longitudinal \nevidence was found for the impact of a large \nnumber of categories of HRM practices: these \nwere recruitment, training, communication, \nemployee involvement, family-friendly practices \nand performance management. Additionally, \nno longitudinal studies were identified that \nreported on the links between HRM practices \nand intermediate outcomes such as motivation, \njob involvement, occupational commitment, \nengagement, organisational justice, organisational \nclimate, psychological contract and perceived \norganisational support. The review demonstrates \nthat longitudinal research linking HRM practices \nand intermediate outcomes is underdeveloped in \nthe health field.\nThe findings of the research examining the impact \nof HRM practices on intermediate outcomes \nidentified in this review were far from conclusive. \nPositive relationships were found between team \nworking on morale and job satisfaction, job variety \nand turnover intentions, and job complexity and \njob satisfaction. However, the numbers of studies \non these relationships is small, and, moreover, \nother variables, such as job demands, job control, \ntask reallocation, role ambiguity, pay and employee \ninvolvement, were not found to have a consistent \nimpact on job satisfaction or organisational \ncommitment. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn \nfrom this research base.\nSome constructs have emerged more recently (e.g. \nengagement and psychological contract) and, \ntherefore, while theoretically important, may not \nyet have been the subject of longitudinal research. \nThe research in health settings on burnout and job \nsatisfaction is perhaps unsurprising, as burnout has \nlong been proposed as a potential adverse reaction \nto care work, and job satisfaction is the most widely \nresearched intermediate outcome in organisational \npsychology and organisational behaviour research, \nwhich chimes with how the layperson would first \napproach the assessment of work.\nOverall, very limited evidence was found and \nthe main theoretical links have not been tested \nlongitudinally in the health sector. Considerably \nmore longitudinal research is needed on a wider \nrange of variables to understand the impact of \nHRM practices on final outcomes in the NHS. \nOne quasi-longitudinal British study has appeared \nsubsequent to our review by West et al.,707 which \nuses aggregated data from a somewhat diverse set \nof practices to create an index of high-performance \nHRM system, and finds it is significantly related to \nmortality rates in hospitals, controlling for prior \nmortality.\nImpact of HRM practices on \npatient outcomes\nThe longitudinal research suggests that three \ntypes of HRM practices \u2013 employee involvement, \ntraining and performance management \u2013 have a \npositive impact on the key patient-care outcomes: \nmortality rates, length of stay, waiting times, \npatient safety and patient satisfaction. More \nspecifically, working in quality improvement teams, \ntraining, and feedback were consistently and \nstrongly associated with reduced infection rates, \nalthough much of the evidence is based on studies \nin the USA. We might therefore target each of these \npractices for further research.\nMore than one-half of the studies involving \npatient outcome identified in the review examined \nthe impact of different staffing models through \ncomparisons of cases using different grades and \ntypes of staff, different combinations of staff in \nteams, or different lengths of shift. The research \non the health sector is therefore very different from \nthe non-health sector research, which has been less \nconcerned with staffing practices.\nConclusions and recommendations\n240\nThe mechanisms (i.e. the intermediate outcomes \nor performance-related employee behaviours) \nby which these HRM practices impact on patient \noutcomes have not been explored. This could \nbe because the HRM practices that make up the \nmajority of studies in this area (i.e. staffing levels, \nsubstitution) are not primarily conceptualised as \nhaving an impact via employee psychological states \nsuch as satisfaction and motivation. For example, \nthey may affect the way work is done. Nonetheless, \nwe should not rule out the possibility that such \nissues as staffing levels may have important \nimplications for employee outcomes such as \nburnout or commitment without further research.\nThe recommendation here is that future research \non HRM considers the impact of these practices \non important employee psychological states and \nbehaviours as well as at the patient outcomes level. \nStudying a broader range of employee outcomes \nwill help provide a better understanding of these \nprocesses in an NHS setting.\nImpact of HRM on \nintermediate and final \noutcomes in the non-health \nliterature\nA comparison of the non-health literature that was \nreported in Chapter 8 with the health literature \nreported in Chapters 6 and 7 reveals a number of \nclear similarities. First, there is an imbalance in the \npractices covered, so, in both areas certain domains \nof HRM are covered disproportionately more \nthan in others. Practices in the categories of work \ndesign and staffing are more prevalent, whereas \npractices in other categories such as family friendly, \ncommunication and employee representation are \nunderexplored. There are no studies of single \nstatus in either area. The gaps in research are \nnot dissimilar between the two sectors in terms of \nthe broad categories of HRM practice for which \nevidence was identified.\nSecond, there is considerable heterogeneity in the \nresearch within each of the HRM categories for \nboth the health and non-health areas, and very \nfew replication studies exist. This limits what a \nsystematic comparison of the studies in a particular \ndomain can achieve, as we are not comparing the \nsame practices or performance measures.\nThird, some HRM practices have been the subject \nof research in both the health and the non-health \nsectors. However, a major difference between the \nresearch in the two sectors is the specific practices \nthat have been studied within each HRM category. \nFor example, the studies in work design in non-\nhealth settings cover five main topics: team work, \njob complexity, job demands and control, job \nrotation, enlargement and enrichment, and role \nconflict or clarity. The work design studies in \nhealth are more limited in scope. Within staffing, \nfor example, health research has focused more \non topics such as staffing levels and substitution, \nwhereas the non-health research has looked more \nat recruitment and selection, induction and flexible \nworking practices.\nSome other differences are to be expected. The \nfinal outcomes differ, between the health and non-\nheath sectors, but also the intermediate outcomes \nand productivity-related employee behaviours \nhave received much greater attention in non-\nhealth compared with health settings. Although \nthere is a large number of studies in the non-\nhealth field, which have examined longitudinally \nthe relationship between some of HRM practices \nand employee outcomes such as satisfaction, \ncommitment and employee performance and \nturnover, there are clear gaps in the HRM \nliterature. The coverage of intermediate outcomes \nsuch as engagement, psychological contract and \nclimate are in non-health sectors just as neglected \nas they are in health.\nThe majority of studies in both areas present \npositive relationships between the practices \nstudied. This may reflect a bias in the acceptance of \npapers by journal editors and referees\u2019 comments. \nBut its implication is that we do not have a very \nfirm basis for ruling out some practices as definitely \nnot contributing significantly or independently to \nfinal or intermediate outcomes. An examination of \nthe cross-sectional studies, if there were sufficient \non specific practice\u2013outcome links, might be used \nto identify some of these.\nThere is some similarity among the studies in this \nreview, although it is rare for more than three or \nfour studies to be sufficiently similar to compare \ndirectly, so many of the findings in this report are \nbased on only a small number of studies. However, \nit is possible to identify some broad themes \nunderlying the findings.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n241\nBroad emergent themes \nfrom the health and non-\nhealth literature\nWork design\nIn the area of work design in the non-health \nliterature, the most studied practices are in the \nemployee autonomy and control categories, \nspecifically within the studies on job enrichment, \nteam working and job control. Job enrichment \n(i.e. providing employees with opportunities to \ntake on broader roles with greater decision-making \nresponsibility) was found to have universally \npositive effects on employee psychological states \nand positive employee behaviours. In addition, \nthe weight of evidence on semiautonomous and \nautonomous teams (i.e. enriched jobs within \nteam working) points again to positive impacts \non employee attitudes and behaviours (e.g. \nproductivity). Further evidence for the importance \nof employee autonomy within the work design \nliterature can be found in studies of job demands \nand control. This is a key theory in the area of work \nstress and most studies have looked at individual \noutcomes such as job satisfaction and psychological \nand physical health outcomes.\nThese studies provide consistent evidence for \nthe positive impact of increased job autonomy \non employee outcomes such as job satisfaction, \nabsence and health. Taken together, these studies \nemphasise the potential importance of HRM \ninitiatives that involve designing jobs which \nprovide employees with the opportunity to have \ncontrol and discretion over their work. Although \none longitudinal study has found evidence \nfor an association between enriched jobs and \norganisational outcomes of company productivity \nand profitability, further longitudinal research at \nthe organisational level is needed to build a more \nrobust picture of organisational effects.34\nIn the parallel field of employee participation, the \nsmall number of studies reviewed here support the \nwidely advocated principle of involving employees \nin the design and implementation of changes (e.g. \njob redesign) that affect their work. Specifically \nin the health literature, employee involvement \nthrough quality improvement teams was found to \nbe effective in terms of improved patient outcomes.\nTraining\nIn the area of training, findings in both health \nand non-health areas are consistently positive for \nthe impact of training on the specific intended \noutcomes of the training initiatives. In some cases \nthere is evidence for the impact of training on \nmore general employee attitudes and perceptions. \nThere is also some limited evidence for the impact \nof training on the final outcome of organisational \nperformance. But again, evidence is limited and \nfurther longitudinal research at the organisational \nlevel is required to clarify the nature of these \nrelationships.\nPerformance management\nSupport for the impact of performance \nmanagement practices is found in both the health \nand the non-health literature. There is evidence \nfrom both sectors for the importance of feedback \non performance outcomes. In the non-health \nsector, feedback was found to have a positive \nimpact on job performance and job satisfaction \nbut this literature places greater emphasis on \nthe importance of participative goal setting in \nconjunction with feedback. This specific link has \nnot been tested in the health literature.\nPromising practices\nThese studies have revealed what the Advanced \nInstitute for Management Research programme \n(www.aimresearch.org\/promising.html) refers \nto as \u2018promising practices\u2019 \u2013 work design that \nenhances employee autonomy and control, \ntraining, performance management (in the form of \nfeedback, participative goal setting, education) and \nemployee involvement.\nThe work design practices were central to \nthe original concepts of high-involvement or \ncommitment models,191,708 but, nonetheless, \nhave increasingly been neglected in the HRM \nperformance literature, as a recent overview31 has \nshown to be the case. However, intensive training \nthat has been more central to the resource-based \ntheory of the firm is also important. Indeed \nthe emphasis on workers\u2019 knowledge and skill \nacquisition are, along with empowerment, the \ncore elements of the Lawler191 and Walton708 \nmodels. They are also key to the more recent \nBailey framework as adopted by Appelbaum et \nal.13 and others, in which practices that enhance \nemployee skills and provide employees with a \nforum to participate (through work organisation \nchanges such as empowerment) are central. \nThere is further evidence for the significance \nof these from a longitudinal study of practices \nin manufacturing, which was not published at \nthe time of our review. Birdi et al.709 replicated \nConclusions and recommendations\n242\nthe findings of Patterson et al.34 reported in this \nreview. Both studies found independent effects \nfor job enrichment (empowerment in the terms \nof the Birdi et al.709 study) and extensive training \non organisational performance, but not for the \noperational management initiatives of total quality \nmanagement, JIT and advanced manufacturing \ntechnology.\nResearch effort expended on these promising \nareas may have the most pay-off but it would be \na mistake given the heterogeneity and limited \nscope of the studies in the HRM if research were to \noverconcentrate on these for a number of reasons. \nFirst, other practices, especially those for which \nthere is no research, may be important. Second, \nwhile they may be critical ingredients in a package \nof HRM practices, they may have synergistic \neffects on other practices. For example, Birdi et al. \nfound that team working was not independently \nassociated with productivity but it enhanced the \nimpact of both training and empowerment, as \nwell as operational practices such as JIT. This \ncontrasts with the results of the longitudinal US \nstudy by Capelli and Neumark149 included in \nour review, which tested for synergies between \npractices but found no strong ones The practices \nrelating to work organisation and training were \nlimited, however, to team working, cross-training \nand job rotation not enrichment or other training \nmeasures.\nThird, it may yet be that integrated approach \nto HRM in which practice use is a reflection of \na more fundamental orientation on the part of \nmanagement, be it high involvement or something \nelse, is more significant for practice than any one \nindividual practice. A cross-sectional study using \nWERS9883 data shows that an integrated measure \nof high-involvement management centred on \nwork organisation practices such as team-working, \nidea-capturing methods, and functional flexibility \nis related to the level and rate of change in \nproductivity.647 Nonetheless, this high-involvement \nmanagement is shown to be discrete from job \nenrichment, as, for example, it is being used in \ncontexts where job autonomy is low as in mass \nproduction manufacturing firms. Moreover, job \nenrichment is more strongly related to labour \nproductivity than high-involvement management.\nThe studies of integrated measures of HRM that \nwe reviewed in Chapter 8, while showing that HR \nsystems do make a difference to performance, \nfound no evidence of an optimal bundle of \npractices in terms of organisational performance. \nLimitations in the methods and particularly \nthe measures means that, in many cases, the \nunderlying concept is not clear enough for one \nto say which HR system is (or systems) are really \nmore effective than others or whether there \nare some practices that account for most of the \neffect. Even in some of the case studies there was \ninsufficient detail of some practices to be even \ncertain what these entailed. Nor again can it be \nruled out that one or more practice is a critical \ningredient and the others are of little consequence \nfor performance. The variety in the studies also \nlimits generalisation. Case studies, such as that \nof Freeman and Kleiner,649 offered convincing \nevidence of effects of a package of practices in one \nsituation, but generalisation to either other sites or \nassumed related or similar interventions would be \npremature.\nFinally, we should not neglect practices outside \nthe HRM domain. As we have seen, their impact \nmay be affected by the use of HRM practices. It \nmay also be that their use is strongly related to \nthe use of HRM practices, which means that we \ncan not be sure that if they are not included in the \nanalysis any link between an HRM practice and \nperformance that is found is either spurious or is \na mediator of the link between the other practice \nand performance. In contrast, if HRM practices are \nfound to be significant and non-HRM practices are \nfound not to be then this strengthens any argument \nabout their importance.\nRelationship between \nintermediate outcomes and \nfinal outcomes\nThe intermediate outcomes examined in this \nreview assessed a range of mental, emotional and \nattitudinal states that are hypothesised to provide a \nbridge between HRM and performance. While we \nacknowledge that HRM practices can have a direct \nimpact on the knowledge and skills of employees, \nwhich, in turn, may influence organisational \nperformance, this review concentrated on the \nrole of employee sociopsychological states. \nThe aim of Objective 3.1 was to investigate the \ncorrelations between these intermediate outcomes \nto assess whether they form discrete concepts. In \nsome cases the meta-analyses reporting strong \nintercorrelations between some of the variables, \nbut not to the degree that there was construct \nredundancy.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n243\nThe review also explored, through meta-analytic \ndata, the correlations between the intermediate \noutcomes and productivity-enhancing behaviours. \nThe premise here is that the intermediate \noutcomes are determinants of salient employee \nbehaviours, which, in turn, help generate effective \norganisational performance. The correlations \nbetween most of variables mostly were small to \nmoderate.\nTwo limitations of the meta-analyses are important \nto note. First, their concentration on cross-sectional \nresearch means that it is not possible to draw \nconclusions about the causal direction of any of the \nrelationships. Second, it is not possible to identify \nthe unique relationship between each intermediate \noutcome and employee behaviours.\nThe studies of the impact of intermediate outcomes \non final outcomes were sparse. No longitudinal \nresearch was found that examined the impact \nof intermediate outcomes on patient outcomes \n(Objective 4.1). In the non-health field, a small \nnumber of longitudinal studies were identified that \nexamined the impact of intermediate outcomes \n(average employee job satisfaction and climate) on \norganisational performance (Objective 4.2). While \nthe studies in this review show associations, the \nevidence on the casual direction of this relationship \nis mixed. This relationship is a crucial link for \nthe premise that HRM influences final outcomes, \npartially through its impact on employee outcomes \nsuch as job satisfaction, and we clearly need more \nsubstantial data sets for surer interpretation.\nDespite these caveats it is worth highlighting \nhere a notable consistency in the findings on the \nrelationships between climate, employee attitudes \nand performance at the individual level and \nthe organisational level. At the individual level, \ntwo meta-analyses indicated that relationships \nof climate (employees\u2019 perceptions of formal \nand informal policies, practices, procedures and \nrewards) with job performance were mediated \nby employee attitudes such as job satisfaction. \nIn other words, the studies suggest climate \nperceptions affect individual-level performance \nthrough their impact on employee attitudes. This \nfinding was replicated at the organisational level, \nas the association between organisational climate, \nmeasured by employees\u2019 perceptions averaged \nfor each company, and company productivity or \nprofitability was found to be mediated by average \nlevel of job satisfaction. These studies provide \nsupport for the idea that HRM practices are the \nmeans through which employee\u2019s perceptions of \nthe organisation\u2019s climate are shaped, which, in \nturn, determine employee attitudes and behaviours \nsupportive of organisational performance. HRM \npractice do not have a direct impact on employee\u2019s \nattitudes and behaviours; rather HRM practices are \nfirstly filtered and interpreted by employees so they \narrive at a view of what the organisation is like and \nthe goals that it pursues.155\nAn understanding of the impact of HRM \npractices on how employees perceive their work \nenvironment, and, in turn, the effect of this on \ntheir behaviours is then valuable and a promising \narea for further research. However, rather than \ntreat climate as a catch-all concept that measures \nemployee perceptions about organisation life, \na more productive approach is to examine the \nlink between the strategic focus of particular \nHRM practices and climate. For example, if an \norganisation\u2019s policy is to promote employee \ninvolvement, voice and participation through \nits HRM practices, to what extent do employees \nperceive that the organisation is enacting this \nfocus. Such an approach also acknowledges the \nimportance of assessing the implementation \nfidelity of HRM practices.\nMeasures of intermediate \noutcomes\nIn order to identify and report on the reliability \nof intermediate outcome measures, the scales \nin all included studies were identified. This \ndemonstrated that the number of measures of \nintermediate outcomes included in the studies \nvaried between types of outcomes. In some \nareas with a long research tradition such as job \nsatisfaction large numbers of different scales \nwere identified. In other, arguably more recent \nareas of HRM research interest, no generic \nscales appropriate to an NHS setting could be \nidentified (as was the case for climate, for which \nmeasures vary widely in terms of subject matter \nprecluding the identification of any one measure \nas particularly appropriate for HRM research) \nor there was no evidence from longitudinal \nresearch examining the link (as was the case for \npsychological contract).\nScales varied in the degree to which they were \nestablished, with examples of one-off scales or \nsingle-item measures. Where a well-established \nscale could be identified for an intermediate \noutcome area, it was selected for inclusion in the \nreview. Where several comparable scales were \nConclusions and recommendations\n244\nfound or no scale could be identified the subject \nexperts on the review team advised on scale \nselection. A major review of measures201 was used \nas the primary source of reliability data for scales \nin 5 of the 12 areas. For the remainder, purposive \nsearching was undertaken for reviews of reliability, \nmeta- analyses or longitudinal studies using to \nprovide reliability data for the scale.\nScales were included for two intermediate outcomes \n\u2013 engagement and psychological contract \u2013 despite \nthe fact that these two outcomes were not amongst \nthose measured by studies in this review. The \nrationale is that both are of burgeoning importance \nin HRM research and their conceptual importance \nin the area justified their inclusion.\nIn general, reasonable reliability data were found \nfor all scales, with the exception of psychological \ncontract, for which no evidence was available. \nUnsurprisingly, reliability data were reported from \na larger number of studies for well-established \nmeasures (e.g. job satisfaction). Reliabilities for \nmost scales were over the 0.7 rule-of-thumb \nthreshold, which indicates good scale reliability.\nThe scales presented here provide a good starting \npoint for the investigation of intermediate \noutcomes in the NHS based on the relevant \nliterature. Many of the scales identified are not \nspecific to the health sector and, given the range of \nintermediate outcomes included in studies in this \nreview and the specific nature of many of the HRM \npractice and intermediate outcome links, there is \nscope for adapting existing scales or developing \nbespoke scales for the NHS in relation to key \nintermediate outcomes. More generally, developing \nor adapting scales for \u2018newer\u2019 intermediate \noutcomes, such as psychological contract, would \nsupport and encourage research in this area.\nConclusions\nThe HRM performance relationship is \ncomplex, multifaceted and multidirectional. \nMany frameworks of HRM and performance \nemphasise linkages between HRM and employee \nperformance, mediated through workforce skills \nand employee psychological states, which result \nin superior organisational performance. However, \nthere is, as we have seen, no longitudinal research \nexploring the totality of any causal chain from \nHRM to intermediate outcomes and employee \nbehaviours, to organisational performance. Cross-\nsectional research also is limited to parts of the \nchain and, moreover, there is insufficient evidence \nthat HRM causes changes in organisational \nperformance. The conclusion from our analysis is \nthat, on the one hand, it would be premature to say \nthat we have a strong evidence base for the HRM \nperformance link; on the other hand, however, \nthere is some evidence supporting elements of \neach stage in the causal chain and theoretical \ngrounds for believing that an HRM system based \non enhancing employee skills, attitudes and \nbehaviours should be beneficial for organisational \nperformance, and, specifically, in the case of the \nNHS, patient outcomes. However, there is a clear \nneed for research that overcomes the weaknesses of \nthe current studies.\nFuture research\nBig science\nMany of the studies that we have reviewed are \nlimited in scope to one or two practices and \nintermediate or outcome variables. Studies of this \nkind, especially on new practices or in under-\nresearched contexts such as health organisations, \nwill continue to be useful. But the implications \nof our overview of the evidence in relation to the \nsix questions we have addressed is that research \nof a much larger scale is required, which covers \nall aspects of the chain from practices to final \noutcomes, and which enables one to test the \ndifferential effects of individual practice, synergistic \nrelationships and integrated approaches.647 This \nechoes Wall and Wood\u2019s30 conclusion that there \nis a need in the HRM area to adopt a strategy of \narticulating and investigating the relative merits \nof competing hypotheses, for more longitudinal \nstudies with data from multiple sources or \nindependent audits of HRM, rather than relying on \nquestionnaire surveys using the response of a single \nperson in the organisation. Many of the important \nquestions are ones that also require large samples \nand the greater the number of variables involved, \nthe larger the sample size required, especially to \ntest for synergies or integrated use. High response \nrates in such large sample sizes are also required if \nwe are to provide a firm base for generalisation.\nThe principles underlying the design criteria for \nsuch studies are the ones that have guided the \nlongitudinal and experimental studies on which \nwe have largely concentrated our review. So, the \noverall weaknesses of the research area we have \nreviewed stem not from the design, but rather \nfrom the almost inevitable limitations of the small-\nscale funding that characterises social science. \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Funding for an individual \nor research team, over just a few years, does not \nprovide the resources to deploy the recommended \nmethods. What is required, as Wall and Wood30 \nsuggest, is much more intensive collaboration than \nis the current norm among the many potentially \ninterested parties, including academics, employer \norganisations, employee organisations, professional \nbodies and government departments. In short we \nneed big science projects on management practices \nand performance that build on the understanding \ngenerated by such systematic reviews as this one.\nThe notion of \u2018big science\u2019 does not preclude \ndetailed study of the nature of practices, the \nintention behind them or the fidelity of their \nimplementation. Indeed, as noted earlier in the \nchapter, smaller studies that examine intent and \nthe depth of practices might be useful. However, \nattending to such detail and the diversity in the way \nin which the same generic practice is designed and \nused could be seen as amplifying the need for a \nlarge team of coordinated researchers as in natural \nscience, for example the Human Genome Project.\nUsing and supplementing \nexisting data\nThere are several ways in which existing data \nsources could be further used to inform this area \nof investigation, some examples of which are given \nhere:\nFirst, WERS,83 an example of a large survey and \nhence \u2018big science\u2019 by current standards, collects \ndata on the health sector and does, in fact, follow \nup questions about use of HR practices with a \nfurther layer of questions (e.g. is appraisal used \nfor pay or development), but in fact there has been \nlittle or no use made thus far of these data. Further \nbespoke analysis of the WERS data set could \nprovide more detailed information about the use of \ngeneral HR practices in the health sector.\nSecond, it would be highly desirable to supplement \nthe HCC Staff and Patient Surveys with a regular \nsurvey of HR practices at the organisational\/trust \nlevel. This could provide a powerful resource for \nidentifying effective HR practices and their effects \non employees within the health sector. It could be \nupdated regularly as new practices come on stream \nand old ones are discontinued.\nA third area that could provide opportunity for \nthe exploration of HR practices in the health \nsector is based on the Core Standards data. The \nHCC requires Trusts to declare their degree of \ncompliance with the Government\u2019s core standards \nfor health care. The core standards are not HR \npractices in themselves, but specify the need for \nsystems to be in place within Trusts, for example \nto ensure that clinicians continuously update skills \nand techniques relevant to their clinical work (C5c, \nHCC Annual Health Check, 2007\/8). Empirical \nresearch could be undertaken to map core \nstandards to HR practice areas and assess the range \nof specific systems in place in Trusts to meet these \ncore standards, providing data on a limited range \nof HR priorities within Trusts and offering the \nscope to explore the differential impact of specific \nHR practices against a particular core standard.\nChange and intervention studies\nTo date, most research conducted to investigate \nthe links between HRM and performance, and \nthe relationships with, and between, intermediate \noutcomes and employee behaviours have been \ncross-sectional and correlational. While in \nmany cases the associations are as predicted, \nwe cannot verify causality. We concur with Iles \nand Sutherland710 (in their review of change \nmanagement in the NHS) that we more need quasi-\nexperimental research, which is better suited to \ndetecting causal effects. The prevalence of changes \nin HRM policies and practices, especially in work \norganisation, provide a good opportunity for \nresearchers and health-care managers to examine \nthe impact of changes in HR practice on employee \nand patient outcomes. We need to use change \nprogrammes to gather robust and comprehensive \ndata to help unpick the multiple dimensions \nand relationships that constitute HRM and \nperformance. However, assessing the impact of any \nHRM initiative must be done with care, taking into \nconsideration its relationship with other practices, \nthe organisational context in general, and using \nrobust methodologies for studying employee \nresponses and organisational outcomes.\nMultilevel investigation of HRM \nand performance\nIn recent years, research on HRM and performance \nhas mainly adopted an organisational level of \nanalysis, empirically testing associations between \nHRM practices and performance. In contrast, more \ntraditional research in HRM and organisational \nbehaviour has gathered individual-level data and \nexamined the relationships between employee \nattitudes and behaviours that we identified as \nConclusions and recommendations\n246\nintermediate outcomes in the review. Given that \nHRM performance models propose that superior \nHRM practices result in more skilled, committed, \nmotivated and productive employees, which, in \nturn, enhance organisational effectiveness, it is \nimpossible to understand how HRM practices \ninfluence performance without considering these \nmechanisms. Ostroff and Bowen155 highlighted \nthat this causal chain is based on multilevel issues, \nin which we have an organisational-level linkage \nbetween HRM and organisational performance, \nand individual-level linkages between employees\u2019 \npsychological states and behaviours. But there is \nalso a cross-level and multilevel premise that there \nis a collective influence of employee psychological \nstates and employee behaviours on organisational \nperformance. Therefore, to understand the \nlinkages between HRM and performance, we \nneed integrated research at multiple levels, yet \na multilevel perspective has rarely been applied \nto this issue. Advances in multilevel analysis \nnow provide powerful techniques for analysing \nlongitudinal and multilevel models of HRM and \nperformance. We strongly advocate using such an \napproach to capturing change in HRM practices \nand performance, incorporating measures at \nindividual and other relevant levels of analysis (e.g. \nteam, ward).\nConcluding comments\nThis review shows that the longitudinal evidence \non the linkage between HRM and performance is \nlimited, especially within the health sector. Many \ncross-sectional studies within the non-health sector, \nand a small number within the health sector, \nhave found an association between HRM and \nperformance, but they cannot claim to demonstrate \na causal link. We know little about how, and in what \ncircumstances, HRM may be lead to enhanced \nperformance. However, we are optimistic that the \nshortfall of evidence is more due to limitations in \nthe quality of research data rather than the likely \nspuriousness of claims about the importance of \nHRM for employee and organisational outcomes. \nMajor empirical challenges remain if we are to \nunderstand the HRM and performance link; but \n\u2018big science\u2019, change and intervention studies \nand multilevel research will help considerably in \nprogressing our understanding of the relationship \nbetween HRM and performance.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

In line with the invitation to tender \n(ITT), a panel of around eight expert advisers \nwill be recruited. The proposed project seeks to \nmaximise the strengths of the two Institutes and \nto build particularly on the strong contribution \nthat the IWP has made to the human resource \nmanagement (HRM) field, empirically and \ntheoretically, and ScHARR and Jo Rick have \nmade to the development of systematic literature \nreviewing generally and particularly in the \nmedical and health-related areas. The research \ndesign aims to achieve the objective of delivering \na critical review of the evidence for the validity \nand reliability of measures of HRM, through an \nexamination of the five objectives outlined in the \ntender document.\nThis section sets out the following:\n\u2022\t the research context and background to the \nstudy, including policy relevance and related \nresearch\n\u2022\t our understanding of the aims and objectives \nof the research and the associated research \nissues\n\u2022\t our proposed methodological approach and \nanalytic methods to be used\n\u2022\t our proposed timetable for the research \nand the outputs we would produce from the \nresearch.\nBackground to the study\nAppropriate HRM policies and practices are widely \nseen as vital if the NHS is to change the process \nof health care and improve outcomes for patients. \nThe key issue is to identify what are appropriate, \nand the evidence on which this can be based. \nThe Department of Health statement and the \nNHS\u2019s Modernisation Agency have repeatedly \nstressed the vital role of human resources, skill \ndevelopment, involvement, teamworking and \nmorale to the modernisation of the NHS and its \nmodels of patient care such as Protocol Based Care \n(NHS Modernisation Agency 2003). In the words \nof the Department of Health\u2019s website \u2018Successful \nhuman resources management improves efficiency \nthrough a culture that supports and develops \nits staff, allowing the workforce to share in the \norganisation\u2019s objectives\u2019.\nThe desire to base the modernisation on evidence \nis confirmed by the Department\u2019s attempt to \nsupport its overall orientation with research \nfindings. It thus, for example, offers the finding \nthat patient mortality rates improve in acute \nhospitals where an HR director is on the Trust \nBoard in support of its view that \u2018Human resources \nmanagement is vital to the NHS\u2019. In this way, the \nDepartment of Health and associated bodies are \nmirroring the more general emphasis on employee \ndevelopment and empowerment as the key to \nmaximising the human resource\u2019s contribution \nto strategic objectives of organisations. It is this \nhuman capital approach to HRM that has been \nat the centre of the literature on HRM in the past \ndecade. In the light of the centrality given it in the \ntender document, it will form the fulcrum of our \nresearch. First it will be a core part of the literature \nreviewed and it will form the starting point for \nidentifying the other literatures and avenues that \nwe need to include in the review. For example, the \ncore of the HRM performance literature focuses on \naggregates of practices, but we will need to extend \nto that which looks at single practices, for example \npayment systems.\nIn some overviews29,646,711,712 of the HRM \nperformance literature there has been a stress on \nhow the research is demonstrating a link between \nhuman capital approach and key organisational \noutcomes. If the evidence were perhaps as strong \nas these reviews or the authors of some individual \nstudies might suggest, there would be little need \nfor this research project. The studies are not so \nhomogeneous, consistent in their results or without \nmethodological weaknesses for us to conclude this. \nIndeed several recent reviews29 have questioned \nthe evenness of the results and highlighted the \nmethodological issues in this area. The implication \nis that the field is young and there is a need to \nAppendix 1  \nTaken from original proposal to NCCSDO\nAppendix 1\n282\ntake stock of the work so far before a further big \ninvestment is made in the area and particularly \nif the general models are to be considered in the \nunder-researched service sectors like health care. \nThe core background factors to this application \nare then (1) the salience being given to HRM as a \nmajor determinant of organisational performance; \n(2) the conclusions that research is supporting a \nlink between HRM and performance; while, on \nthe other hand (3), that there is a questioning of \nthe homogeneity and robustness of the research \nevidence; and (4) the timeliness of taking a broad-\nranging stock-take of the HRM field and its \nimplications for health-care policy. We shall now \nexpand on each of these factors.\nThe salience given to HRM in both \nhealth care and as a universal model\nThe key background to the study is then the \ngrowing attention over the past 20 years to HRM as \na major contributor to organisation performance, \neven in capital or technological intensive \nindustries. It is assumed to contribute both in its \nown right and as a support for such other modern \nmanagement practices as total quality management \nand just-in-time (JIT). So, in the health context \nHRM adds to the human capital of the workforce \nand helps support new modes of organisation, \ntechnology and patient delivery. Its importance \nderives from an assumption that some forms of \npersonnel management have greater effects on the \ndevelopment, skills and motivation of employees \nthan others. Forms that are thought to have such \neffects, as the tender specification acknowledges, \nare indeed often labelled HRM. Alternative labels \nare the human capital, high-commitment, high-\ninvolvement and high-performance approaches. \nFor ease of presentation we shall refer to the \nspecific model as the high-involvement model and \nuse HRM when a potentially more all-embracing \nconcept of personnel management is being \nreferred to.\nMuch of the attention given to the high-\ninvolvement or -commitment HRM system has \nbeen advocatory. Contrasting it with a traditional \nTaylorist or Fordist approach, academics (e.g. \nPfeffer,2 Kochan and Osterman,3 Walton1) \nhave been at the forefront of publicising high-\ninvolvement management as a progressive form \nof management that can remove past restrictions \nto economic efficiency and achieve high-quality \nperformance, and thus sharpen the competitive \nedge of Western organisations and improve public \nsector delivery. The argument is that there is a \nunique set of practices or approach to management \nthat will, regardless of the context, outperform \nall others, either eternally or at this particular \nhistorical conjuncture. Outside of the human \nresource (HR) and organisational behaviour \narenas, in the strategy literature, the resource-\nbased theory of the firm5,6 has also highlighted the \nway in which human resources and the knowledge \nembodied in them may be decisive for the long-\nterm competitive advantage of firms, while in the \noperations management literature7\u201310 the emphasis \nis on how HR practices and the knowledge and \nskills of workers are decisive for the successful \nexploitation of lean production11 and other modern \nmanagement methods (see, for example, Dean and \nBowen12 on total quality management).\nResearch supports the core thesis\nThe second background factor is the widely \nexpressed view that the main research studies in the \nHRM area have confirmed that high-involvement \nmanagement does positively affect organisational \nperformance. The basic hypothesis that underlies \nmuch of this work is that: high-involvement HR \nsystems will have positive effects on organisational \nperformance. As academics have sort to move \nbeyond advocacy of high-involvement systems, they \nhave focused on testing this hypothesis. A spate \nof research studies in the 1990s were motivated by \nthis. Many concluded that high-involvement HR \nsystems do perform best.13\u201320 Several overviews \nof the studies21,22 concluded on the basis of the \nfirst few studies that the universalistic hypothesis \nis supported. The increasing use of the term \n\u2018high-performance\u2019 model to describe the set \nof practices might be seen as implying that the \nmatter is indeed settled, much as a drug might be \nnamed by the disease it is known to cure. Overviews \nhave tended to present the studies in a rather \nhomogeneous way, largely assuming that it can \nbe taken for granted they have been studying the \nsame phenomenon and the results are broadly the \nsame. These reviews have led to the conclusion that \nthe main issue now is to explain the link between \nhigh-involvement management performance, i.e. \nassess the mechanisms between them or get inside \nthe black box between the system and the outcome. \nA second issue might be the extent to which the \nlink will be found in all contexts, and particularly \nin service industries such as health care. The \nmajority of the early studies were in manufacturing, \nand it is significant that one of the few early \nstudies in services24 found evidence of a contingent \nrelationship between the human capital approach \nand performance. In the past few years there have \nbeen more studies that have either been in the \nservice sector or included it in their study15,25\u201327 and \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n283\nthe results have been mixed. Studies specifically on \nhealth care are emerging, For example, West et al.\u2019s \nstudy28 has investigated the link between HRM and \npatient mortality.\nThe debate is far from over\nA third background to the study is the increasing \nrealisation that the portrayal of the studies as \nproviding conclusive evidence for a universal link \nbetween HRM and performance is premature, and \nthat there is a clear need to delve more deeply \nboth in to the studies and the reality of high-\ninvolvement management and its links to other \naspects and methods of management. The reviews \nso far have not used the systematic review methods \nwe propose to adopt, hence the timeliness of the \nproject.\nThere are eight reasons for extending the debate:\n1. The results of the various studies are neither \nas clear-cut nor as uniform as some have \nconcluded (see Wood29 and particularly his \ntable 1 for summary of the main results). \nWithin studies, there is unevenness in the \nfindings between performance measures. While \nsome results point to universal effects, others \ndo not. Moreover, in many studies only the \nuniversal hypothesis has been tested, so one \ncannot rule out the contingency argument that \nthe effects of high-involvement management \non performance are contingent on a third \nfactor, either a dimension of the context or \nthe strategy of the organisation, even when \na positive link between high-performance \nmanagement and performance has been \nfound.\n2. A variety of other hypotheses have been tested, \nincluding the contingency hypotheses that \nhigh-involvement management works best \nwhen used in conjunction with other quality \nor lean practices. The results of these in some \ncases question the universal thesis.\n3. There is considerable variability across studies \nin the practices included either in the model \nof high-involvement management or the set of \npractices used to test its link to performance. \nSome of the differences are terminological, \nperhaps reflecting disciplinary biases or \na quest to differentiate ones wares. But a \ncore difference within the literature can be \nidentified. On the one hand are those who see \nthe core of high-involvement management \nas changes in work organisation, job design \nand employee involvement methods (and \nparticularly idea capturing) with the other \npractices as supports to help motivate and \nequip people to work in a new more flexible \nand proactive way. On the other hand are those \nwho do not prioritise the task system but treat \nhigh-involvement management as entailing \nthe use of the whole gamut of sophisticated \npersonnel management methods and conceive \nthem as primarily operating through people\u2019s \ncommitment and sense of whether they are \nbeing treated fairly and consistent with their \npsychological contract. The two approaches \nneed not affect greatly the practices researchers \ninclude in their studies, but the first would \nnot treat them in an undifferentiated way. \nNonetheless, the inclusion of job design and \nwork organisation practices is one major source \nof diversity between the studies. The other is \nincentive systems with some studies treating \nthem as part of high-involvement management \nor at least performance management, others as \ncontradicting it.\n4. The vast majority of studies are based on \nreported use of a practice and do not assess its \neffectiveness or differentiate between its mere \nexistence and its effective implementation. \nFor example, appraisals may be conducted \nbut the extent to which they are done well \nor whether they are mainly for control or \npayment purposes rather than development \nor employee involvement purposes is not \nconsidered.\n5. It is not always clear whether high involvement \nor performance management is being defined \nsimply as the combined used of the best \npractice in each domain of human resources, \na synergistic set of practices, or by a more \nfundamental managerial orientation.713 In fact \nthe discussion so far has begged the question \nof how we define and identify a system. Most \nstudies have defined an HR system a priori, \noften with little theoretical justification, as \nthe emphasis has been on testing the high \ninvolvement\u2013performance link rather than first \ninvestigating the relationship between practices \nor the nature of any systems. Researchers have \nmeasured HRM on the basis of differentiating \norganisations by their usage of a set of \npractices, the precise means varying between \nstudies. They then correlate the measure \nwith performance measures. The problem of \nsimply aggregating practices to provide an \noverall measure is that each practice is treated \nimplicitly as if it were equally important. \nWith only a few exceptions (e.g. Patterson \net al.33 forthcoming), studies have provided \ninsufficient information about which individual \nAppendix 1\n284\nor subset of practices has the strongest effects \nand which may be marginal or even irrelevant. \nIn one case13 where this was done and it was \nshown that only some of the practices affect \nperformance, and, moreover, that their \nstrength varied between industrial context, the \nauthors still framed their conclusions in terms \nof an overall (high-performance work) system \nyielding superior performance. Aggregating \npractices does not allow one to test whether the \neffects are synergistic and begs the question \nof whether the pattern of association between \npractice use reflects a single underlying \norientation [which, in statistical terms, would \nbe implied if a one-factor model could be fitted \nto the data (see, for example, Wood and de \nMenezes26 and Wood29].\n6. Despite the differences in focus and measures, \nmost of the studies share a basic research \ndesign, which has a number of weaknesses. \nThese include:\ni. The use of cross-sectional designs \u2013 \nlimiting causal inference (i.e. do HRM \npractices promote performance, or does \nbetter performance encourage greater \ninvestment in HRM?).\nii. Reliance on a single data source (e.g. \nCEO or HRM Director) for information \non HRM practices and performance \n\u2013 resulting in measures of unknown \nreliability and susceptible to common-\nmethod bias (see, for example, the debate \nbetween Huselid and Becker42 and Gerhart \net al.43 on the reliability of measures based \non single respondents).\niii. Many but not all include small samples, \nlow response rates and a concentration \non a limited range of sectors \u2013 limiting \ngeneralisability.\n7. There has been insufficient theoretical \ndiscussion or empirical exploration of the \nmechanisms or intervening variables that \nmight explain any link between HRM and \nperformance. Labels such as high commitment \nand involvement imply certain mechanisms \nthat are concerned with the extent to \ncommitment or engagement on the part \nof the work force, which is mirrored in the \nimportance given to morale in statements \nabout the modernisation of health care. Much \nof the theoretical justification that precedes \nthe empirical studies, however, implies that \nskills, knowledge and learning might be as \nimportant, independent of attitude change. \nWhile some studies have sought to include \nintervening variables these have either centred \non intermediate HR outcomes (e.g. labour \nturnover in Huselid18) or concentrated on \ncommitment and satisfaction (e.g. Patterson et \nal.,36 Wright et al.37). Several authors hint at, but \ndo not explore in depth, other mechanisms, for \nexample Guest and Conway38 imply procedural \njustice. The emphasis in statements on the \nmodernisation of health care, in addition to \nmorale and staff development, is on achieving \nwhat might be termed the strategic integration \nof individuals into the organisation so that \nthey both understand and share the goals that \nachieving patient care entail and consequently \norientate their behaviour towards common \nvisions. Studies outside the narrow confines \nof the HRM studies, particularly building \non the job redesign and lean production \nliterature, point to the importance of the \nkinds of attitudes that advocates of total \nquality management and other modern \nmanagement methods highlight, for example \nquality consciousness (e.g. Peccei and Wood39) \ncontinuous improvement orientation (Coyle-\nShapiro40) or flexible work orientation (Parker \net al.41).\n8. The majority of studies have concentrated \non a narrow range of HRM practices in \nisolation, the exception being those that \nhave included TQM in their analysis (e.g. \nMacDuffie,20 Patterson et al.,33 de Menezes \nand Wood713), but there is a general failure to \nassess the effectiveness of HRM and related \npractices relative to both other key elements of \nmanagement such as leadership and practices \nfurther afield, such as R&D expenditure.\nTaking stock of the HRM performance \narea\nThe fourth background factor is the clear need \nto appraise the area in depth prior to developing \nfurther studies. Despite the diversity in the \nstudies and the limitations of their methodology, \nthe studies thus far have provided a foundation \nfrom which broader and more methodologically \nappropriate studies can be designed. There is \nsufficient promise in the body of evidence to \nconsider major investments in the area. However, \nit is timely to invest in detailed assessment of what \nwe know and can take from the studies so far. If an \nexercise is treated as the foundation for both good \nHRM practice and the next stage of research, it \nwill need, however, to go beyond simply assessing \nthe studies. As we have implied, they have been \nlimited. Assessing their precise limits will be part of \nthe analysis of them. But, as we have implied, some \nof the limits are clear:\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n285\n1. The focus has been on the practices\u2013\nperformance link to the neglect of both \ntheoretical discussion and research on the \nnature of the association between the practices.\n2. The mechanisms or intervening variables that \nmight explain any links have been insufficiently \nexplored, theoretically or empirically, and what \ndiscussion there has been has been limited.\n3. The precise performance variables that one \nwould expect particular HR practices to have \nbeen linked to have not been spelt out.\n4. Research studies have not tended to be \ndesigned to test multiple competing \nhypotheses.\n5. How the high-involvement management \nmodel links to other elements of management \npractice and theory and particularly leadership \ncorporate governance has been neglected.\nIn order to overcome these weaknesses any \ntaking-stock exercise should be broad ranging, \nwell beyond the narrow confines of the recent \nHRM performance studies. There is also a need \nto examine in more depth the applicability of \npractices to all settings and how they may have to \nbe adapted in specific service organisations. Health \ncare provides an excellent example to aid this.\nThe importance for policy of finding out if there \nis a link between a given model of HRM and \nperformance is self-evident. But the above implies \nthat the key issues are: is any relationship general \nor specific? Is it an underlying orientation towards \ndevelopment and involvement or is it certain key \npractices that is key? If the latter, are there a few \ncritical ingredients or is there a holistic set that \nreact together synergistically? Is HRM largely a \nsupport for operational practices? If there is a link, \nwhich are the key performance measures that are \nmost affected by HRM? And, above all, why and \nwhat are the mediating variables? If the crucial \nthing is internal consistency between practices and \nensuring policy is realised through them, is HRM \nsimply one of a number bundle that works, as the \nconfiguration approach implies? In the health-\ncare case, the additional question is the extent to \nwhich ideas like lean production can be readily \ntranslated to the health-care context, and where \nthere has been a conscious attempt how successful \nhas it been. All these issues are entailed in the five \nobjectives of the study as proposed in the tender \ndocument.\nResearch objectives and issues\nThe next section (Objectives for the research) \nconsiders each of the research objectives and \nthe likely literature available to provide relevant \nevidence. We then consider the main research \nissues and associated implications for the design of \nthe methodology.\nObjectives for the research\nThis research aims to deliver an up-to-date, \ncomprehensive and authoritative critical review \nof scientific evidence in relation to the reliability \nand validity of measures of HRM. Specifically, the \nresearch comprises the following five subsections \nfor which the research must make explicit the \nevidence in order to achieve its objectives.\nDescribe HRM methods and measure \nthe fidelity with which they may be \nimplemented (Objective 1)\nWe understand this objective of the research is \nconcerned with identifying the main methods of \nHRM, how widespread is their use, the fidelity with \nwhich they are implemented (i.e. the degree to \nwhich HRM policy is put into practice), and how \nthat fidelity can be assessed. This is potentially a \nvery wide literature with different approaches to \nthe definition and measurement of specific HRM \nmethods. The implications for this research are \ndiscussed below (see The scale of the relevant \nliterature).\nReview the reliability of measures of \nparticular intermediate outcomes \n(intended outcomes of HRM that may \neffect patient care indirectly, e.g. \nmorale, absences from work, stress) \n(Objective 2)\nWe understand this research objective is concerned \nwith the robustness and utility of measures of a \nnumber of intermediate outcomes, i.e. the results \nof HRM methods that can impact on patient care. \nSuch an exercise inevitably involves the cataloguing \nof intermediate outcomes. These are likely to be \nwide-ranging and, in some instances (e.g. stress \nmeasures), command a substantial literature in \ntheir own right. Additionally, as we have argued \nabove, we will consider as broad a range of \nintermediate variables are possible. We extend \nfrom the current concern with commitment and \ninvolvement to other individual-level outcomes, \nsuch as stress, morale and procedural fairness, \nas well as newer \u2018outcomes\u2019, such as proactivity. \nClearly, dealing with such a potentially vast and \nuneven literature and deciding what it is feasible, \npragmatic and desirable to include in relation to \nthe current study has major implications for the \nresearch methodology and these are discussed \nbelow (see The state of the relevant literature).\nAppendix 1\n286\nReview of the literature on the \ncorrelation of intermediate outcomes to \neach other (Objective 3)\nWe understand this objective of the research to be \nconcerned with establishing the extent to which \nindividual measures of intermediate outcomes \ncontribute unique information. An important issue \nto note here is that whilst the general literature \nmay indicate a high degree of correlation between \ncertain intermediate outcome measures, it is \npossible that these measures will behave differently \nwhen considered in relation to specific HRM \nmethods or final outcomes (relevant to research \nObjectives 4 and 5).\nInterrogation of the literature \ninvestigating the correlation of \nintermediate outcomes with final \noutcomes (be these business or patient \ncentred) (Objective 4)\nWe understand this objective of the research to \nrequire evidence on two levels:\n\u2022\t the correlation (i.e. level of association) \nbetween the presence of certain intermediate \noutcomes (e.g. improvements in morale) and \nthe presence of certain final outcomes (e.g. \nimprovements in clinical quality standards), \nand, where possible,\n\u2022\t evidence of a causal link between intermediate \noutcomes and final outcomes (i.e. evidence \nthat improvements in morale led to improved \nclinical quality standards).\nSome evidence exists (of a cross-sectional nature) \nthat demonstrates associations between, for \nexample, job satisfaction (intermediate outcome) \nor self-reported stress (intermediate outcome) \nand organisational performance (final outcome). \nHowever, limited evidence about the impact of \nboth types of outcome can be drawn from cross-\nsectional studies. The research concerned with \ncause and effect is likely to be a relatively small \nliterature with only a limited number of studies of \na longitudinal design and sufficiently robust as to \ndemonstrate the intermediate\u2013final outcome link \ncausally.\nThe issues for the research to address are thus:\n\u2022\t how to ensure that all such longitudinal \nresearch is identified, and\n\u2022\t how to clearly distinguish the level of evidence \nidentified and the type of conclusions that can \nbe drawn in the report.\nSee below (The scale of the relevant literature) for \na description of our proposed approach to rating \nthe evidence on quality criteria and the conclusions \nthat can be drawn from different types of evidence.\nInvestigation of the sensitivity of \nintermediate outcomes to individual \nHRM methods alone or in conjunction \nwith each other (Objective 5)\nAs with Objective 4 of the research, we understand \nthis element of the study to be concerned with \nevidence both of the association between the \npresence of HRM methods and intermediate \noutcomes, as well as with evidence of any causal \nlink between changes in HRM methods and \nintermediate outcomes. That is the extent to which \nthere is evidence that, for example, changes in \nHRM practices cause reductions in self-reported \nstress. As for the previous subsection of the \nresearch, there is a large body of cross-sectional \nresearch detailing evidence of the co-existence of \nspecific HRM methods and intermediate outcomes. \nHowever, research of the type that can provide \nevidence of the extent to which HRM methods \nbring about specific intermediate outcomes is much \nmore limited and likely to amount to only a few \nstudies in total. Once again, the same implications \nfor the research are identified and these are \ndiscussed more fully below (see The scale of the \nrelevant literature).\nResearch issues and \nmethodological solutions\nThinking through the research objectives in the \nITT there are a number of technical and scientific \nissues that this research will need to overcome:\n\u2022\t nature of evidence sought\n\u2022\t scale of the relevant literature\n\u2022\t state of the relevant literature\n\u2022\t ensuring work is free from bias.\nEach of these research issues is discussed in \nturn and the implications for the design of the \nmethodology are highlighted.\nThe nature of the evidence sought\nThe five inter-related objectives of this project \ncall for a comprehensive review of the literature \nin relation to a number of different questions. \nAnswering the research questions posed in the ITT \ndemands evaluations of different types of evidence \nfrom different sources. Table 62 summarises the \ninformation\/evidence needs for all five subsections \nof the research.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Searches on a single database for the \nterm \u2018HRM and performance\u2019 alone would typically \nproduce in excess of 500 peer-reviewed references. \nThe grey literature (i.e. relevant articles that have \nnot undergone a peer review process, or individual \ncase studies) may also be significant.\nAdditionally, many of the relevant intermediate \noutcomes for this research (e.g. stress, job \nsatisfaction, morale) command extensive literatures \nin their own right. A search on the relevant \ndatabases for each intermediate outcome area \nwould be likely to generate a list of references, \nin some cases, reaching the thousands. For \nexample, a recent review of Psychosocial Hazard \n(Stressor) Measures,49 which looked specifically at \nthe reliability and validity of measures of stress, \nidentified in excess of 3000 original sources of \npotential relevance, which, when checked against \ncriteria for content, elicited in excess of 150 usable \narticles.\nOne potential strategy for dealing with the scale of \nthe literature, as recommended in the ITT, is the \nuse of existing systematic reviews of the literature. \nWhere they exist, we will seek to use such sources; \nhowever, it is inevitable that in some areas there \nwill be no such reviews, or that they will be out of \ndate or of poor quality and it will be necessary to \nresort to original sources. A key requirement of \nthe methodology for this research, therefore, is \nthe need for expertise in the most sophisticated \nsystems for data retrieval and synthesis of evidence.\nA further consideration in dealing with a \nliterature of this scale is to have sophisticated and \ntransparent rationale for the scoping and targeting \nof content relevant literature. In order to deliver \nthis we propose to use an approach based on the \nmedical model of systematic reviews,49,50 which \nmembers of the team have successfully used in \nsimilar previous studies. Implicit in the proposed \napproach is the use of a standard proforma to \napply relevance criteria to each potential source of \nevidence. This is an efficient and reliable method \nof rapidly identifying the most important articles \nfrom a large body of literature. The approach \nis described fully in the methodology (see \nMethodological approach, below).\nThe state of the relevant literature\nThe literature relating to the research objectives, \nparticularly Objectives 2\u20135, is likely to be very \nuneven in terms of size, depth, availability \nof reviews and type of questions covered. For \nexample, in certain areas, recent, comprehensive \nsystematic reviews of the reliability of intermediate \noutcomes measures (Objective 2) exist (e.g. Stressor \nAppendix 1\n288\nmeasures, Rick et al.50). Equally, cross-sectional \nstudies reporting on the presence of specific HRM \npractices, such as job design or training, and \nintermediate outcomes, such as job satisfaction, \nare relatively plentiful (Objective 5). In contrast, \nlongitudinal studies demonstrating causality \nbetween, for example, organisational commitment \nand final outcomes, such as, for example labour \nproductivity, are relatively scarce (Objective 4) as \nwould be studies of specific HRM practices and \n\u2018new\u2019 intermediate outcomes such as proactivity \n(Objective 5).\nA further consideration here is that, dependent \non the availability of evidence, the research \nsubsections call for the comparison of very different \ntypes of evidence. For example, the methodology \nwill need to make consistent comparisons across \nsystematic reviews, meta-analyses, traditional \nreviews, empirical peer-reviewed articles, case \nstudies and grey literature. A further complication \ninherent in the nature of HRM research is that the \napproaches often combine very different types of \ndata. For example, studies show the use of different \nmeasures of individual HRM practices, variation in \nHRM system composition across studies, variation \nin the techniques researches use to combine \nHRM practices into coherent groups, different \nlevels of analysis (e.g. HRM and organisational \nperformance data at workplace, business and \ncorporate level, and intermediate data at individual \nand organisational level) and a combination of \nobjective and self-report measures of, for example, \nperformance (Wall and Wood;712 Wright and \nGardner714).\nIn order to ensure consistency in approach when \ncomparing such different types of evidence and \ndata, we will develop a system for recording the \nvarious types of research design, types of data \ncollected and the quantity of data identified in \neach source of evidence. This will be based on \nexisting classifications, but be tailored to the issues \nand complexities of the HRM literature. Such an \napproach is implicit within the systematic review \nprocess.\nAside from proforma for reviewing each individual \nsource of evidence, a primary concern of this \nreview is to establish what can be said about each of \nthe five subsections of the research overall on the \nbasis of theoretical and empirical knowledge. This \nshould not only reflect the state of the literature \noverall, but should identify any uncertainties in the \nevidence base, drawing attention to areas where \nthe evidence is strong or weak, or where there is no \nreliable evidence.\nOur judgement is that it will be possible to provide \neasily accessible information about the quality \nand quantity of evidence in relation to each of the \nmain relationships of interest within each research \nsubsection through the development of quality \nratings for the review. This is an approach that \nhas been used previously to aid the assimilation \nof wide-ranging evidence about different subjects \n(see, for example, the Department of Health715 \npublication on selection of appropriate mental \nhealth interventions and the British Psychological \nSociety review of Level B measures, Bartram et \nal.716). We feel that this will be particularly useful \nfor Objectives 4 and 5 of the research, where \nthe ITT specifies that the intended audiences \nare general (and will not necessarily be research \nliterate).\nThe research team (e.g. Michaels and Booth717) are \naware of the existence of numerous such schemes \nthat have been used to classify the literature in this \nway.717\u2013722 Rather than invent yet another variation, \nwe would attempt to identify an appropriate \nexisting classification of strength of evidence, \nbased on the type of question being asked and the \ntype of evidence being used to address it. Critical \nelements of such a classification would include \nwhether the research is theoretical, observational \nor experimental, the overall robustness of the study \ndesign (where experimental) and whether there \nis homogeneity or heterogeneity of results. Such \na grading system would be agreed on completion \nof the criteria and identification of the key \nrelationships of interest. However, for the purposes \nof illustration, the system might (for illustrative \npurposes only) resemble the following:\n\u2022\t theoretical knowledge suggests X (*)\n\u2022\t one cross-sectional study or several with \nvarying results (**)\n\u2022\t several cross-sectional studies with the same \nresults or one longitudinal study (***)\n\u2022\t several longitudinal studies with conflicting \nresults (****)\n\u2022\t several longitudinal studies with consistent \nresults (*****)\n\u2022\t randomised controlled trial(s) (******).\nSelection of an appropriate classification system \nmight well vary according to the different levels \nof evidence sought in relation to the research \nsubsections specified in the ITT.\nEnsuring the research is free from bias\nA major task for the researchers undertaking this \nreview is to demonstrate that the work is conducted \nin a way that is free from bias. Previous research by \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n289\nmembers of this team in the area of reviews (e.g. \nthe psychosocial hazards research by Rick et al.49), \nhas highlighted the need for explicit, transparent \ncriteria to be developed for literature reviews. These \ncriteria should reflect generally agreed standards \nwithin research and should be developed in \nline with the specific aims and objectives of the \nproject. It must also be possible to demonstrate \nthat these criteria are applied by the researchers \nin a systematic way (e.g. through checks including \ninter-rater reliability). This ensures that the review \nprocess is as free from bias as it is possible to make \nit, and that any other researchers conducting the \nsame task with the same criteria would achieve \nsimilar results. This further reinforces the \narguments for adopting a systematic review process \nin line with the approach that we will propose here.\nIn addition to using a systematic approach to the \nreview process, we propose to establish a panel \nof experts to contribute to specific stages of the \nresearch. Expert advisers would be appointed \non the basis of their expert knowledge of the \nHRM literature and\/or their knowledge of the \nhealth sector and\/or the contribution they can \nmake (through experience) to developing the \nappropriate processes for conducting this type of \nreview. The rationale is twofold:\n\u2022\t It provides an efficient way of assessing leading \nedge knowledge on HRM methods and \nliterature, the context for this research and the \nbest procedural approaches for conducting this \ntype of review.\n\u2022\t Given the immature nature of the evidence \nbase, it seeks to achieve consensus in the \nprocesses for identifying the best evidence \navailable in relation to the research questions \nspecified in the ITT.\nSuch a consultative approach should ensure \nthat the processes developed for conducting the \nresearch are as free from bias as possible, and as \nrelevant as possible to the focus of this research.\nThe next section describes the proposed \nmethodological stages for this research.\nMethodological approach\nSystematic literature reviews\nThe literature review will be conducted according \nto established evidence-based principles developed \nin medicine and allied health fields, as a systematic \nway of pulling together and assessing the quality \nof evidence around a given research question \nand making recommendations for practice. This \napproach involves a number of stages:\n\u2022\t formulating specific, answerable questions for \neach of the research subsections\n\u2022\t devising the most parsimonious search \nstrategies for identifying relevant data\n\u2022\t developing inclusion and exclusion criteria \n(based on relevance to the research questions \nand minimum quality standards) for sifting all \nidentified sources of evidence\n\u2022\t developing review proforma for assessing the \nquality of evidence in each data source (passing \nthe inclusion\/exclusion criteria sift) in relation \nto the specific review questions\n\u2022\t synthesising the assessments for each specific \nreview question\n\u2022\t summarising and drawing conclusions on the \nevidence in relation to each.\nEach of these stages is described fully below. A \npotential difficulty of this approach is that often \nthe available evidence about any question is small \nin quantity, of poor quality or inconsistent. For this \nreason the review will demonstrate a sensitivity to \nthe particular requirements of systematic reviews of \nthe management literature.56,723 This will recognise \nthe need to consider the best available evidence, \neven where rigorous experimental studies are not \navailable, and, if necessary, where no empirical \nevidence exists, resorting to the best theoretical \napproaches. In doing so, the collaborating team \nwill draw on their considerable experience of \ndifferent types of integrative synthesis of evidence-\nbased approaches to general management \ntopics.49,50 They will draw on systematic reviews \nof the health management literature (National \nInstitute of Clinical Studies80) in order to inform an \nappropriate methodology.\nResearch stages\nWe envisage a methodology comprising the \nfollowing stages.\nEstablish expert advisor panel\nOne of the first steps in the project will be to \nestablish the expert adviser panel, which will have \nan number of roles:\n1. helping to identify experts for the interviews\n2. contributing to the list of HRM practices\n3. suggesting additions to the identified literature \nfor each subsection of the research\nAppendix 1\n290\n4. helping to develop the inclusion\/exclusion \ncriteria for each subsection of the research\n5. helping to define appropriate rating criteria \nfor each element of the study.\nThree expert advisers have already expressed \nwillingness to fulfil this duty (we would wish to \napproach a further five people should the contract \nbe awarded):\n\u2022\t Professor Kevin Daniels, who has expertise in \nHRM, particularly in relation to intermediate \noutcomes and as a journal editor (Journal of \nOccupational and Organizational Psychology, \nJOOP) has an excellent overview of the \nliterature in this area.\n\u2022\t Dr Rob Briner, who has extensive knowledge \nof the data on intermediate outcomes and \nlinks between intermediate and final outcomes. \nDr Briner is also a journal editor (Human \nRelations), so brings considerable knowledge of \nthe current literature in this area to the project.\n\u2022\t Dr Olga Tregaskis, who has worked for many \nyears in international HRM. Her research \nfocuses on multinationals, national training \nand employment regulations, flexible working, \nand training and development. Dr Tregaskis \nis the UK representative on the Academy of \nManagement International Management \nDivision, an international network of HRM \nacademics, and thus brings to the project an \nunderstanding of both European and North \nAmerican research on this subject and excellent \nlinks with the international HRM academic \ncommunity.\nBoth Professor Daniels and Dr Briner have \nworked on previous systematic literature reviews \nconducted by the Institute for Employment \nStudies and therefore also have expertise in \ndeveloping appropriate tools for the review (i.e. \nsetting appropriate inclusion\/exclusion criteria and \ndeveloping tailored quality rating criteria).\nIn addition to an expert panel we would also seek \nat this stage in the research to create links with \nother research groups who are working on the \nsame or related questions. Specifically, the Service \nDelivery and Organisation (SDO) commissioned \nresearch on the effects of work and stress on \noutcomes for patients, and the Policy Research \nProgramme commissioned research on HR \ninterventions and outcomes in the NHS. As well \nas any others, in the UK or abroad, who can be \nidentified by the expert advisers.\nObjective I: Catalogue of methods of \nHRM and fidelity with which they have \nbeen applied\nThis will require close and iterative work between \nthe literature-searching team and the subject \nexperts to generate an exhaustive list of methods \nof HRM. This list will be generated through \ninterviews with experts, by textual analysis of \nsample HR policies, and by thematic analysis of \na select but wide-ranging purposive sample of \nexisting reviews, traditional and systematic, of the \nHRM literature. The expert advisors will be asked \nto identify for each method the best evidence \navailable about the fidelity with which methods \nhave been implemented, looking beyond published \narticles and books to include unpublished literature \nand research groups in the area.\nThis will include identifying the experts\u2019 \ngeneral perspective on questions such as the \nbody of evidence in relation to both single and \ncombinations of HRM methods and the range \nof measures for assessing the fidelity with which \nmethods have been implemented. Pre-existing \nframeworks (such as Wright and Gardener714) \nclassifying levels of implementation in HRM \nmethods will also be used to provide further insight \ninto how methods have been put into practice.\nObjectives 2\u20134\nIn contrast with the theoretical sampling required \nfor Objective 1, the remaining research objectives \nwill be addressed via a series of systematic reviews. \nThe application of scientific methods limits bias \nin the identification, appraisal and synthesis of \nall relevant studies that address a specific focused \nquestion. In particular, where logistic constraints \nsuch as those required for completion of this \nreport exist and where data are plentiful, it is most \nefficient to conduct a \u2018review of reviews\u2019. This \nmeans that, rather than examining all the primary \npapers cited in reviews or replicating synthesis \nof data from these papers the reviewers critically \nexamine conclusions drawn by the authors of these \nreviews.\nWherever possible, we will use existing systematic \nreviews of the literature for each of the Objectives \n2\u20135 of the study.\nReview of reviews\nSystematic searches will be conducted through \nidentified keywords on databases such as Web of \nScience, MEDLINE, PsychLit and the Emerald \nsuite of management databases. This will be done \nat two levels:\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n291\n\u2022\t the macro level (for terms such as HRM, HR \npractices, personnel, staff recruitment, staff \ndevelopment)\n\u2022\t the micro level for specific HRM methods \nas identified in Part I of the research (e.g. \nworker participation, training, job security, \npromotion, teamworking, incentives); \nintermediate outcomes (e.g. morale, stress, \nproactivity, commitment); and final outcomes \n(e.g. performance, organisational performance, \nturnover, productivity, retention, clinical \nstandard, patient care).\nThese computer searches will be supplemented \nby citation searching (to detect research studies \nthat share a common ancestry) and related-article \nfeatures to allow the generation of related concepts. \nHand-searching and examination of relevant \njournals (examples include: Academy of Management \nJournal, European Journal of Innovation Management, \nHealth Care Management Review, Health Services \nResearch, International Journal of Human Resource \nManagement, Journal of Healthcare Management, \nJournal of Management Development, Journal of \nManagerial Psychology and Journal of Organizational \nBehavior) will be supplemented by tightly focused \nsearches of the internet using advanced search \nfeatures.\nNew systematic reviews\nWe anticipate that Objectives 3 and 4 of the \nresearch in particular will require in-depth \nappraisal and analysis of existing reviews together \nwith the conduct of a new review. The theoretical \nframework for the new review will divide the \nmechanisms identified into those where the \nevidence base derives from within the health \nliterature, those where the literature originates \nfrom general management and those where both \nliteratures are represented. Each item of evidence \nidentified will be assessed both for the strength of \nits signal regarding application to HRM in health \norganisations and its noise regarding limitations of \nresearch design.73 A systematic literature review will \nbe conducted using accepted systematic literature \nsearch techniques for the years 1995\u20132004. Online \nsearches of relevant computerised bibliographic \ndatabases will be undertaken using comprehensive \npermutations of key words representing \nmechanisms and key words depicting outcomes. \nDatabases to be searched will again include: \nMEDLINE, PsycInfo, the Emerald databases and \nWeb of Science.\nThe expert advisors will identify key researchers \nin the area. These researchers will be contacted by \ne-mail, introducing the project, informing them \nof publications already identified and asking them \nfor the references for other relevant published or \nunpublished evidence. This request will be followed \nup by up to two reminders as necessary.\nTowards the end of the project a brief \nsupplementary search for recent journal articles \nand publications will be conducted to ensure an up-\nto-date bibliography and evidence base.\nAs the need is for transparent criteria, it is \nessential that our methodology in identifying and \nreviewing evidence is both explicit and objective. \nWe therefore propose to conduct this review by \nadhering strictly to predetermined criteria for \nassessing published work. Such criteria will reflect \ngenerally agreed standards within research, \ndeveloped to meet the specific aims and objectives \nof the project (e.g. Popay et al.,724 Oxman725). \nIn demonstrating that these criteria have been \napplied in a systematic way this will ensure that the \nreview process is as free from bias as is possible, \nensuring reproducibility for complementary \nprojects or subsequent work.\nThe methodology for the literature review process \nwill involve four main stages, each building on \nthe previous one. Unlike many reviews where \nthe search processes are conducted early in the \nproject and then retrieved materials passed on \nto the review team, the iterative nature of the \nproject combined with the task dependencies \narising from Objectives 1\u20135, will require ongoing \ninteraction with the expert advisers needing to be \nconsulted at each stage. For example, the compiled \nbibliography will be circulated to the expert \npanel on a number of occasions with a request for \nadditional evidence omitted from the list. Further \nitems will thus be added to the database, and the \nupdated bibliography circulated again asking the \nexperts to check for omissions.\nSummary of stages of review for \nObjectives 2\u20134\nFor each substantive review, the following stages \nwill be undertaken:\n\u2022\t formulation of specific questions to be \nanswered\n\u2022\t development of inclusion and exclusion criteria \nbased on the relevance of the articles to the \nreview questions and minimum quality criteria\n\u2022\t development of review criteria for assessing the \nquality of evidence\n\u2022\t training of review team and piloting of criteria\nAppendix 1\n292\n\u2022\t conduct of review and data extraction\n\u2022\t synthesis of data and analysis of results.\nBibliographic software\nThe reference management software package \nreference manager will be used for this review. This \npackage allows direct transfer of references from \nthe electronic databases. References will be coded \naccording to source of the reference, whether the \npaper is for inclusion, and, if so, to which of the \nobjectives it will likely contribute. This system of \ncoding will ensure that lists of publications can be \neasily retrieved according to topic area or purpose \nwithin the review.\nObjective 5: to assess the \nsensitivity of intermediate \noutcomes to individual HRM \npractices\nBy this stage of the review it is anticipated that \nthe team will have identified points of theoretical \nsaturation. For each combination of methods and \noutcomes (intermediate and final) they will identify \nmethods where there is:\n\u2022\t strong evidence, either for or against, yielded \nby systematic reviews\n\u2022\t strong evidence, either for or against, from \nprimary studies\n\u2022\t indicative evidence only, either for or against, \nfrom observational studies, case studies, grey \nliterature\n\u2022\t no evidence.\nThis review will thus alert readers to the extent \nand nature of the strengths and weaknesses in the \nevidence discussed in relation to individual studies \nand the field more broadly.\nIntended approach to data \nextraction and analysis for \nresearch Objectives 2\u20135\nOnce inclusion and quality rating criteria have \nbeen developed, training of the review team will \ntake place to ensure consistency of approach. The \naim of this training will be to anticipate queries \nand to develop a protocol for tackling issues as \nthey arise during the review. For example, several \npapers will be selected and each member of the \nreview team will review the papers separately. \nThe inter-rater reliability will be calculated, and \ntraining and documentation expanded, until \nratings show an acceptably high level of agreement. \nIn addition, areas of disagreement will be discussed \nwithin the team and resolved prior to completion \nof the reviews. While this approach necessarily \ndeviates from idealised conditions of quantitative \nreview, whereby two reviewers extract data for every \nincluded paper, we believe that this approach is \njustified by the nature of the evidence types being \nconsidered. In contrast with formal meta-analysis, \nthere is little empirical methodological research \nto indicate incremental benefits for dual data \nextraction and analysis where non-quantitative \nresearch is being examined. However, all issues or \nqueries arising from the extraction or analysis will \nbe referred for a second opinion (either to another \nresearcher or a member of the expert panel), and \nwhere a candidate homogeneous quantitative \nsubset is identified these papers will be subject to \ndual extraction and analysis.\nInitially, evidence tables containing such details as \ncitation, setting, study type, level, scope\/variables, \noutcomes\/results and comments will be produced \nby the research associates. These will then be \nsubjected to detailed analysis and quantitative\/\nqualitative review by the experts on the review \nteam.\nTimetable and milestones\nThere is as yet, no fixed start date for the project. \nWe would be able to start immediately and propose \nthe timetable and milestones as in Table 63.\nProject outputs\nThe primary output of this project will be a \nwritten report presenting the results of work on \neach of the five objectives in separate chapters in \nrecognition of the different target audiences for \neach subsection. This report will thus include the \nconventional sections on recommendations for \npractice (where such evidence exists to support \nthese) and recommendations for future research. \nIn addition it will follow the brief in the tender \ndocument by extending its consideration more \nwidely to policy implications. In addition to the \nresearch report, the research team will identify the \nmost appropriate avenues for dissemination of the \nwork.

Job incumbents typically are trained to carry out their prescribed tasks, and \ngiven a certain degree of discretion over how they do so. \u2018Job design\u2019 refers to the outcome of \nthis process and may be defined as the specification of the content and methods of jobs\nOther terms often used as synonymous for job design include \u2018work design\u2019 and \u2018job\u2019 or \u2018work \nstructuring\u2019. \u2018Work organisation\u2019 is also frequently used to encompass job design, but usually \nsignifies broader perspective linking jobs more explicitly to their organisational context\nWithin the field of organisational behaviour job design has specifically focused on properties of \nthe job, referred to as \u2018job characteristics\u2019, such as the variety of tasks in jobs and the amount \nof discretion job incumbents have in completing those tasks\nStaffing: Recruitment\/\nselection\/placement\/ \nworking hours\/staffing \nlevels\/skill mix\nTraditionally, recruitment has been conceptualised as the organisational process that precedes \nselection. More specifically, recruitment has been described as the process of generating \npools of applicants for job vacancies; selections as the process of choosing from among those \napplicants. Recruitment has been regarded as an attraction activity, selections as a screening or \nwinnowing activity\nMore recently, recruitment and selection have come to be regarded as less distinct activities\nTraining and development When learning events are planned in a systematic fashion and are related to events in the \nwork environment, they are called training programmes. From this point of view, the training \nprocess is defined as the systematic acquisition of skills, rules, concepts or attitudes, which \nresults in improved performance in the work environment (Goldstein 1993726)\nMost training programmes have the following stages:\nNeed assessment: Consists of a series of analyses that assess the organisation, the job and \nthe person performing the job in order to provide input for the design and evaluation of the \ntraining system. This stage requires determination of which tasks are required on the job and \nwhich knowledge, skills and abilities are necessary to learn to perform those tasks\nTraining environment: Once the tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities and objectives have been \nspecified, the next step is designing the environment to achieve the objectives. Training is a \ndelicate process that requires a supportive learning environment. The training process must be \ndesigned to facilitate the learning of the knowledge, skills and abilities required to perform the \ntasks that the trainee needs for successful job performance\nTraining evaluation: The number of different types of objectives that organisations hope training \nprogrammes can achieve varies widely. However, the true efficacy of any training programme \nlies in how the programme is evaluated against pre-determined objectives. The evaluation \nprocess centres around two procedures \u2013 establishing measures of success (criteria) and using \nresearch designs to determine what changes have occurred during the training and transfer \nprocess. Criteria must be established for both the evaluation of trainees at the conclusion of \nthe training programme and the evaluation of on-the-job performance\nCompensation and \nrewards\nPay can be in cash or benefits, such as health care, a paid vacation or a company car. Payment \nsystems vary within and across organisations in their mix. Some organisations pay all \nemployees a base salary whereas others use variable pay where some portion of employees\u2019 \npay is uncertain. For example, performance-related pay refers to a number of pay programmes \nthat link pay to the individual, group and organisation level performance measures. Pay \nprogrammes that influence pay mix are merit pay, incentive pay, gainsharing, profit-sharing and \nstock options. Pay can also be described in terms of its level, i.e. how much organisations pay \nfor specific jobs, and in terms of its structure which refers to the nature of pay differentials \nwithin an organisation. Payment systems can influence attitudes and behaviours of employees, \nand which employees are attracted to the organisation and which decide to leave\nAppendix\u20022\n296\nHR category Definition\nCommunication Through communication, organisations and their members exchange information, form \nunderstandings, coordinate activities, exercise influence, socialise, and generate and maintain \nsystems of beliefs, symbols and values. Communications has been called the \u2018 \u201cnervous system\u201d \nof an organised group\u2019 and the \u2018glue\u2019 that holds organisations together\nDue to the complexity of the organisational communication process and the many levels \nat which communication occur, there is no generally agreed theory of organisational \ncommunication. Different positions have been advanced on several issues\nThere are at least two positions on the role of communication in organisations. One regards \ncommunication as a subprocess that plays an important role in other organisational processes. \nFor example, communication serves as a channel for the exercise of leadership or for the \nmaintenance of interorganisational linkages. The other position argues that communication is \nthe process that constitutes the organisation and its activities. Rather than being a subsidiary \nto key phenomena such as leadership, communication is regarded as the medium through \nwhich these phenomena and, more generally, organisations are created and maintained\nOrganisations have two distinct communication systems: formal and informal. The formal \ncommunications system is a part of the organisational structure and includes supervisory \nrelationships, work groups, permanent and ad hoc committees, and management information \nsystems. The informal communication system emerges from day-to-day interaction among \norganisational members. Ties in the informal network are based on proximity, friendship, \ncommon interests and political benefits more than formal job duties. The informal system \nincludes the \u2018grapevine\u2019 and the \u2018rumour mill\u2019\nEmployee\/family friendly The term \u2018work and family\u2019 or the \u2018family friendly workplace\u2019 is one that recognises the non-\nworkplace family responsibilities of its employees, and develops and implements policies \nthat allow employees to simultaneously fulfil work and family responsibilities. Different \ncommentators propose different definitions, usually accompanied by a list of policies that \nallegedly meet their criteria. Hartin (1994: 76),728 for example, describes \u2018family-friendly\u2019 \npolicies as those \u2018designed to minimise the impact of work on family life\u2019 and identifies the \n\u2018family-friendly\u2019 policies currently in force as varieties of leave for maternity or paternity, \nsickness, emergencies and compassionate reasons; career breaks and extended leave; \nflexitime, part-time work and rostered days off. Gary Johns, Assistant Minister for Industrial \nRelations in 1994 in Australia, identified family-friendly work policies \u2018as flexible working \narrangements, permanent part-time work, job-sharing, career break schemes, paid or unpaid \nfamily leave, and assistance with child care and elder care responsibilities that can help workers \nbalance their work and family responsibilities\u2019 (Work and Family 1994729)\nSingle status\/status \nharmonisation\/status \ndifferentials\nSingle status refers to the provision of common terms and conditions of employment to all \nemployees of a single enterprise. It means, essentially, that all workers of whatever grade \nwill share the same set of employment benefits (pension, sick pay, annual leave, parental and \nmaternity provisions) and be paid through the same mechanism (e.g. annual salary). Single \nstatus contrasts with the traditional \u2018status divide\u2019 between hourly paid manual workers and \nsalaried staff, and may arise either from trade union negotiating pressure or from a desire on \nthe part of the employer to foster teamwork and commitment. The achievement of single \nstatus can be costly and for this reason there may be incomplete harmonisation of employment \nconditions across the workforce hierarchy\nHarmonisation is referred to as movement away from separate terms and conditions of \nemployment for manual hourly paid and white-collar salaried employees, towards single status, \ni.e. common basic terms and conditions of employment. Harmonisation most frequently \naffects holiday and leave entitlement, redundancy pay and occupational pensions. It may also \nhave a symbolic element involving the use of common restaurant and car-parking facilities or a \nstandard company uniform\nEmployee representation\/\ninvolvement\/participation\nEmployee involvement has been used to describe a wide range of practices in organisations. \nCommon to all these practices is the attention paid to increasing employee influence over how \ntheir work is carried out or over other areas of organisational policy and practice\nAppraisal\/performance \nmanagement\nThere is no universally accepted definition of performance management, and it is sometimes \nused simply to refer to \u2018performance appraisal\u2019 or to \u2018performance-related pay\u2019. However, it \nis increasingly coming to mean a general, integrated HR strategy that seeks to create a shared \nvision of the purpose, aims and values of the organisation, to help each individual employee \nunderstand and recognise their part in contributing to them, and, in so doing, to manage and \nenhance the performance of both individuals and the organisation. Typically, elements of such a \nstrategy will include developing the \u2018mission statement\u2019 and business plan, objective setting and \nother methods of performance measurement, appraisal, performance-related pay and various \napproaches to enhancing internal communication\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n297\nHR category Definition\nHigher-level concept \n(HPWP\/HPWS)\nOrganising the work process so that non-managerial employees have the opportunity to \ncontribute discretionary effort is the central feature of an HPWP. HPWPs emphasise the \ndevolution of the gathering and processing of information to the level of non-managerial \nemployees, who act on and use the information for problem-solving and decision-making.\nNo one has consistently defined, or even uniformly named, HPWPs (Bakker 1999;730 Becker \nand Gerhart 1996;23 Delaney and Goddard 1997;731 Wood 199935). They have been called \nHPWSs, alternate work practices, and flexible work practices (Delaney and Goddard 2001731). \nDespite the name variances, many of these programmes share common elements, including \nrigorous recruitment and selection procedures, incentives based upon performance, and \nextensive training programmes focused on the needs of the business (Becker et al. 1997153). \nEssentially HPWPs require heavy investment in human capital that is intended to enhance \nemployee skills, knowledge, motivation and flexibility with the expectation that the employer is \nproviding employees the ability and the opportunity to provide input into workplace decisions \n(Van Buren and Werner 1996732). Companies expect this empowerment to enable employees \nto adapt quickly and readily to rapidly changing product and labour market conditions, and to \nimprove operational efficiency and firm performance (Becker and Huselid 1998;16 Cappelli and \nNeumark 2001149)\nHPWP, high-performance work practice; HPWS, high-performance work system.\n\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The potential for relevant, \npublished literature or evidence to be missed is \nalso increased. If this occurs, the meta-analysis \nmay be affected by so-called publication bias. This \nis because a limited literature search may only \nfind those studies listed in one or two of the most \npopular databases or catalogued with a particular \nkeyword or term. Consequently, other, equally \nrelevant and potentially important studies listed \nin other databases and catalogued using slightly \ndifferent terms may therefore be missed. The \nfindings of any analysis based on such a limited \nliterature search would therefore be compromised \nbecause it would not represent all of the relevant \nand available evidence on the topic. The checklist \ntherefore makes an evaluation of the degree of \npotential search or publication bias in the included \nmeta-analyses and reviews.\nSelection bias\nIn order to guard against inconsistency in the \nselection of studies, meta-analyses need to develop \nand apply explicit inclusion criteria. The more \nspecific and detailed the criteria, the more likely \nit is that only primary research studies satisfying \nthese criteria will be included, and therefore the \nmore consistent and homogeneous the sample \nincluded in the analysis.662 The checklist therefore \nincludes an evaluation of stated inclusion criteria in \norder to assess the potential degree of any selection \nbias in the analysis.\nExtractor bias\nThe extraction of data for the meta-analysis should \nbe \u2018explicit, unbiased and reproducible\u2019 (Cook \net al.659) If only a single reviewer is involved in \ncoding or extracting data from studies for a meta-\nanalysis or review, or if no assessment is made of \nthe consistency between two or more reviewers \nperforming coding or data extraction (e.g. inter-\nrater reliability score), then there is an increased \nlikelihood of bias or error entering the analysis \nbecause the data on which it is based may not have \nbeen recorded consistently.662 The potential degree \nof this so-called extractor bias is therefore assessed \nby the checklist.\nQuality appraisal\nA major source of bias also resides in the \nmethodological quality of included studies. Giving \nequal weight to studies of very different quality \nmay have an adverse effect on the validity of the \nfindings of a meta-analysis; this is emphasised in \nall of the literature evaluating meta-analyses.659\u2013662 \nIf there is variation in the methodological quality \nof included studies then there is an increased \nlikelihood of a \u2018false-positive\u2019 conclusion or Type \nII error (that there is an effect, when in fact \nthere is not), if, for example, less rigorous or \nmethodologically robust studies have provided \nthe larger effect sizes in the meta-analysis. On the \nother hand, these less rigorous studies might also \npotentially obscure the results of the higher-quality \nstudies and give a \u2018false-negative\u2019 conclusion, or \nType I error (indicating no effect, when there \nis one).725 The failure to conduct some form of \nquality assessment means that either these less \nrigorous studies cannot be excluded or sensitivity \nanalyses cannot be performed to gauge the effect \non the overall effect size found by the analysis of \nstudies of different quality. The checklist developed \nfor this report therefore evaluates whether a \nquality assessment of included studies had been \nperformed, in order to assess whether potential \nbias or error may have been introduced into the \nmeta-analysis or review from this source. However, \nno meta-analysis in this field conducted such an \nAppendix 9  \nDiscussion of bias in meta-analyses\nAppendix 9\n318\nevaluation, so it exists as a potential source of bias \nin every meta-analysis or review included in this \npaper.\nAnalysis\nRandom effects models give a more conservative, \ncautionary, and therefore reliable, estimate of \neffects sizes, that is the size of the relationship \nbetween two variables. Fixed effects models should \nonly be used for meta-analyses where there is clear \nhomogeneity between effects sizes. A meta-analysis \nshould therefore test for the homogeneity or \nheterogeneity of effect sizes in order to determine \nthe most appropriate effects model.665,667,733 If a \nQ-statistic\/chi-squared statistic or credibility interval \nindicates heterogeneity (i.e. if the Q-statistic or \nchi-squared statistic is significant or the credibility \ninterval includes 0) then the analysis needs to use \na random effects model. In the absence of any \nsuch test, a random effects model should be used. \nHowever, it is always preferable to use a random \neffects model because this test is only capable of \ndetecting heterogeneity when the heterogeneity \nof effect sizes is large, and the number of studies \nis neither too small nor too large.733\u2013735 The failure \nto use the appropriate model might mean that the \noverall effect size reported is more precise than the \ndata can actually support. However, almost all of \nthe meta-analyses included in this report used the \nrandom effects model of Hunter and Schmidt736 \nand Hunter et al.737 The checklist therefore records \nwhether this model has been used, but reports the \npotential presence of potential bias only if neither \nthis model nor some other appropriately selected \nrandom effects model has been used.\nModerator or sensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis (sometimes called \u2018moderator \nanalysis\u2019) is used to test assumptions about the \nfindings of the analysis by exploring the effect of \nexcluding certain studies from the analysis, or by \ncomparing the results for different subgroups. For \nexample, by excluding studies with the smallest \nsample sizes, it is possible to determine whether \nthe analysis is subject to publication bias.733 Or, \nby excluding studies of poorer quality, it can \nbe assessed how far study quality affects the \nresults. The outcome is a more robust analysis \nthat has tested assumptions that might affect its \nfindings.659,662,733 For meta-analyses relating to \nintermediate outcomes, a sensitivity analysis might \ninvolve either comparing the results of overall \ncorrelations with those for particular measures of a \nconcept only. For example, Lodahl and Kejner\u2019s424 \nmeasure of job involvement has 20- and six-item \nscales, and a sensitivity or moderator analysis \nwould examine results for overall and more specific \nmeasures of job involvement.189 The performance \nof such an analysis permits a more rigorous \nassessment of the findings of the meta-analysis. \nThe meta-analytic process advocated by Hunter \nand Schmidt and Hunter et al.736,737 requires the \nperformance of such moderator analyses, so many \nof the included meta-analyses have tested the \nrobustness of their results in this way.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Next is a more detailed breakdown of \nthe meta-analyses from which the overviews are \nconstructed. Description, quality appraisal and \nresults of the included meta-analyses for each \nintermediate outcome are provided below.\nMotivation\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nNo meta-analyses of motivation satisfied the \ninclusion criteria.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 55 studies, one of \nwhich met the inclusion criteria:738\n\u2022\t Judge and Ilies738 conducted a meta-analysis of \n65 studies with 78 samples, reporting data on \ncorrelations between two facets of motivation \n(goal setting and expectancy) and a single \ndimension of OCB (conscientiousness).\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nPublication and extractor bias were high in the \nmeta-analysis of Judge and Ilies,738 although \nselection bias was low. Moderator analyses were \nperformed by testing for the effect of setting on the \nresults.\nResults\nThis moderate quality meta-analysis found a \nmedium correlation between goal setting and \nconscientiousness (0.28) and a small correlation \nbetween expectancy and conscientiousness (0.23). \nHowever, any conclusions should be drawn with \ncaution, as the findings are from only one meta-\nanalysis.\nJob satisfaction\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 121 studies, four of \nwhich met the inclusion criteria:\n\u2022\t Faragher et al.739 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 485 studies, reporting data on correlations \nbetween job satisfaction and burnout. The \nanalysis did not require studies only to have \nused a particular measure or measures of job \nsatisfaction for them to be included.\n\u2022\t Hellman740 conducted a meta-analysis of \n50 studies, reporting adjusted correlation \ncoefficients for the relationship between job \nsatisfaction and turnover intentions. The \nanalysis did not specify the scales used to \nmeasure either variable.\n\u2022\t Brown and Peterson741 performed a meta-\nanalysis of 59 studies and reported corrected \ncorrelation coefficients for the relationships \nbetween job satisfaction and organisational \ncommitment, propensity to leave (turnover \nintentions), work motivation and job \ninvolvement.\n\u2022\t Finally, Blegen742 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 48 studies, reporting adjusted correlation \ncoefficients for the relationship between job \nsatisfaction and both commitment and fairness. \nThe analysis did not specify the scales used to \nmeasure either variable.\nAlso, Witt and Nye743 conducted a meta-analysis \non their own sample of 56 correlations using their \nown composite measure. Although correlation \ncoefficients between \u2018global\u2019 satisfaction and \nperceived fairness of pay or promotion across a \nsizeable number of samples were reported, this was \nnot a cross-study meta-analysis and so has been \nexcluded from this review.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThree out of the four meta-analyses that satisfied \nthe inclusion criteria for this review were of \nrelatively high quality. The studies of Faragher et \nAppendix 11  \nAssessment of bias for included meta-analyses\nAppendix 11 \n322\nal.739 and Blegen742 were of high quality as they \nonly had one potential source of serious bias, while \nthe potential for other types of bias was only low. \nFaragher et al.739 was subject to low publication \nand selection bias, and was only vulnerable to high \nextractor bias in the coding of studies. Moderator \nanalyses were performed by testing the effect on \nthe results of using both fixed and random effects \nmodels. Blegen742 had relatively high publication \nbias because a specific search was conducted to \nidentify unpublished studies, but details of all other \naspects of the literature search are extremely vague. \nHowever, potential selection and extractor bias was \nlow; a test for homogeneity was performed and a \nrandom effects model was used; and moderator \nanalyses were performed by testing the effect of \nsetting and publication date on the results.\nThe meta-analysis of Brown and Peterson741 was of \nsimilar, relatively high quality: it had low selection \nand extractor bias, but there was potentially a \nmoderate amount of publication bias. This meta-\nanalysis used a fixed effects model rather than a \nrandom effects model, testing for homogeneity, \nwhich revealed consistency across effect sizes; \nalthough they did perform moderator analyses by \ntesting for the effect of different populations and \ndifferent measures.\nFinally, the quality of the meta-analysis by \nHellman740 was very low: publication, selection, \nand extractor bias were all high (no details were \ngiven of any of these processes) and no information \nwas given about the effects model used, although \nmoderator analyses were performed.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 121 studies, 14 of \nwhich met the inclusion criteria:\n\u2022\t Dalal744 conducted a meta-analysis of 38 studies \nwith 49 samples, reporting data on correlations \nbetween job satisfaction and an overall score \nfor OCB.\n\u2022\t LePine et al745 conducted a meta-analysis of \n37 studies (37 samples) and reported data on \ncorrelations between satisfaction and an overall \nscore for OCB.\n\u2022\t Harter et al.746 conducted a meta-analysis of 42 \nstudies across 36 organisations conducted by \nthe Gallup Organization. They reported data \non correlations between job satisfaction and \nturnover (measured as a dimension of business \nunit performance).\n\u2022\t Judge et al.656 carried out a meta-analysis of 254 \nstudies comprising 312 independent samples, \nand reported data on correlations between job \nsatisfaction and job performance.\n\u2022\t Organ and Ryan162 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 55 studies (55 samples), reporting data \non correlations between satisfaction and five \ndimensions of OCB (altruism, civic virtue, \ncourtesy, sportsmanship and compliance, but \nnot conscientiousness).\n\u2022\t Brown and Peterson,741 as mentioned in \nthe section on job satisfaction correlations \nwith other intermediate outcomes, above, \nperformed a meta-analysis of 59 studies and, \nin addition to the correlations between job \nsatisfaction and the intermediate outcome \nvariables of interest, reported corrected \ncorrelation coefficients for the relationships \nbetween job satisfaction and both performance \nand turnover.\n\u2022\t Carsten and Spector747 conducted a meta-\nanalysis of 47 studies examining the \nrelationship between job satisfaction and \nemployee turnover.\n\u2022\t The meta-analyses performed by Irvine and \nEvans,748 comprising 11 studies, and by Tett \nand Meyer,749 comprising 155 studies (178 \nsamples), both examined the relationship \nbetween job satisfaction and turnover.\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis of Farrell and Stamm750 \nwas based on 72 studies and reported \ncorrelations between job satisfaction and two \nabsence variables (total time lost and absence \nfrequency).\n\u2022\t Iaffaldano and Muchinsky157 reported a \nmeta-analysis of correlations from 74 studies \non various aspects of job satisfaction and its \nrelationship to performance. Petty et al.751 \nperformed a similar meta-analysis on the same \nvariables based on 31 studies, but focused \nspecifically on individual level job satisfaction \nand performance.\n\u2022\t Steel and Ovalle752 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 34 studies and reported data on correlations \nbetween job satisfaction and turnover, while the \nmeta-analysis of Scott and Taylor753 examined \nthe relationship between job satisfaction and \nabsenteeism in 23 studies (114 correlations).\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThe methodological quality of the meta-analyses \nincluded in this report ranged from very good \nto very poor. One meta-analysis was of very high \nquality,656 six meta-analyses were of relatively \nhigh,157,162,741,744,745,749 one was of moderate quality747 \nand five were of only low quality.748,750\u2013753\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n323\nThe rigorous meta-analysis carried out by Judge et \nal.656 was superior to the other analyses involving \njob satisfaction in this section. Although only \none electronic database was searched, potential \npublication bias was low because searches of \nunpublished literature, hand-searches of 21 \njournals and reference tracking of previous meta-\nanalyses took place. Furthermore, the potential for \npublication bias is acknowledged and a test carried \nout by Judge et al.656 suggests limited effects on the \nresults. Potential selection bias was low as inclusion \ncriteria were clear, although no information about \nthe number of reviewers involved or about inter-\nrater reliability was given. Extractor bias was also \nlow, with inter-rater reliability reported for the \ncoding process. The random effects model of \nHunter and Schmidt736 was used and a test for \nthe homogeneity of effect sizes was performed. \nModerator analyses, again superior to those of the \nother meta-analyses included, were also performed, \ntesting for the effects not only of different measures \nof satisfaction and performance, but also of study \ndesign and quality. In particular, these moderator \nanalyses tested for the effects of longitudinal versus \ncross-sectional studies and of high-ranked versus \nlow-ranked journals or sources; no other meta-\nanalyses distinguish these factors.\nThe meta-analyses of Dalal744 and Organ and \nRyan162 were both good methodologically. In \nboth cases, there was moderate publication bias \nbecause only a small number of databases or grey \nliterature sources were searched, but otherwise \nselection and extractor bias were low. Both studies \nalso performed sensitivity analyses. LePine et al.745 \nhad moderate potential publication bias because \ngrey literature was searched and relevant authors \ncontacted, but had low selection bias because \ninclusion criteria were clear. LePine et al.745 also \nperformed a test for homogeneity, used a random \neffects model for the analysis, and performed \nmoderator analyses by testing for the effect on the \nresults of using different measures of OCB and \nmeasuring different dimensions of this concept. \nOnly extractor bias was high.\nThe meta-analysis of Tett and Meyer749 was of \nmoderate to high quality. The literature search \ncould have been more comprehensive, as only \none bibliographical database was searched, but \nmultiple methods were used, a specific search was \nmade for unpublished studies, and the potential \nfor some publication bias in the included sample \nof studies was acknowledged. Potential selection \nbias was low. A test for homogeneity was performed \nand a random effects model used for the analysis. \nSensitivity analyses were also performed to test the \nrobustness of the findings by evaluating the impact \non effect sizes of different outcome measures.\nThe meta-analysis of Brown and Peterson741 was of \nrelatively high quality (for details, see Correlations \nwith other intermediate outcomes, above).\nThe meta-analysis of Laffaldano and Muchinsky157 \nwas also of relatively high quality. There was \nmoderate potential publication bias because only \none database and no sources of grey literature \nwere searched, although supplementary literature \nsearching methods were used. Selection and \nextractor bias were both low because inclusion \ncriteria were specific and detailed, and the \nreliability of the coding was tested and an \ninter-rater reliability score reported. No test of \nhomogeneity of effect sizes was performed, but a \nrandom effects model was used. Sensitivity analyses \nwere performed to assess the effect on the results \nof year of publication and the different measures \nof job satisfaction and performance used by the \nincluded studies.\nModerate quality meta-analyses\nThe meta-analysis of Carsten and Spector747 was \nof moderate quality. Potential publication bias \nwas moderate as there were no sources of grey \nliterature and only one database was searched, \nalthough supplementary literature searching \nmethods were used. Selection bias was low because \ninclusion criteria were specific and detailed, but \nno details were provided about the coding process \nso potential extractor bias was high. A test of \nhomogeneity of effect sizes was performed, and a \nrandom effects model was used, but the sensitivity \nanalysis by occupational group alone was limited.\nLow quality meta-analyses\nThe meta-analysis of Petty et al.751 had a number \nof substantial weaknesses. The literature search \nwas extremely limited, consisting only of hand-\nsearching a number of journals, so the potential for \npublication bias was high. Extractor bias was also \nhigh: no information was given about the coding \nof the included studies. Potential selection bias, \nhowever, was low because clear inclusion criteria \nwere given. There was no test for homogeneity of \neffect sizes, but a random effects model was used \nand moderator analyses were performed based on \nthe different measures of job satisfaction, such as \nthe JDI.\nThe meta-analysis of Irvine and Evans748 was also of \npoor quality. A test for homogeneity was performed \nAppendix 11 \n324\nand a random effects model was used, but there \nwas a high degree of publication and extractor bias, \nand a moderate degree of selection bias. Although \nsensitivity analyses were performed, these results \nwere not related to job satisfaction.\nThe analysis of Scott and Taylor753 was of similar \nlow quality. The potential for publication bias \nwas high because the details of the literature \nsearch consisted of no more than the statement \nthat, \u2018A comprehensive review of the \u2026 literature \nuncovered 23 studies\u2019. Inclusion criteria were \nlimited, and potential extractor bias was high. \nHowever, although no test for homogeneity was \nperformed, a random effects model was used and \nsensitivity analyses were performed, based on \ndifferent measures of absenteeism.\nThe meta-analyses by Harter et al.746 Farrell \nand Stamm750 and Steel and Ovalle752 were \nmethodologically weaker. In Harter et al.746 \npublication bias was high because studies were only \nincluded if they were undertaken by the Gallup \nOrganization. Some selection criteria were applied \nto the small pool of available studies, although \nthese were limited, and no information was given \non coding of data, so extractor bias may be high \nalso. However, the form of analysis was good: a \nrandom effects model was used and subgroup \nanalyses were performed.\nIn the other two analyses, extractor bias was high \nin both because no information was given on how \nthe coding process was performed. Publication \nbias was moderate in Farrell and Stamm750 because \ndatabases were searched and other information \nretrieval methods, such as reference-tracking and \nhand-searching of journals, were used, but no \ngrey literature sources were searched. Publication \nbias was high in Steel and Ovalle752 because the \nliterature search performed was even more limited. \nHowever, selection bias was low in Farrell and \nStamm750 and Steel and Ovalle752 because inclusion \ncriteria were given. Neither analysis tested for \nhomogeneity of effect sizes, although both did use \na random effects model. Both analyses performed \nsensitivity analysis based on the occupation status \nof the sample, but Steel and Ovalle752 conducted an \nadditional analysis based on time to turnover.\nResults\nGenerally, the high-quality meta-analyses reporting \ncorrelations with intermediate outcomes found \njob satisfaction to have a moderate to high \npositive association with perceptions of fairness, \norganisational commitment, job involvement and \nmotivation. The high-quality meta-analysis of \nFarragher et al.739 found a large, positive correlation \nbetween low job satisfaction and burnout (0.48). \nThere were medium to large negative correlations \nwith turnover intentions in two studies, although \none of these meta-analyses was of very low \nquality.740\nA relatively large number of meta-analyses \nreporting correlations between job satisfaction \nand employee behaviours were included in this \nreview, therefore only those of high or moderate \nquality will be included here. Three meta-analyses \nreported small to medium positive relationships \nbetween job satisfaction and overall measures of \nOCB, and three reported small to medium negative \nassociations between job satisfaction and turnover. \nThe rigorous meta-analysis by Judge et al.656 found \na moderate positive relationship between job \nsatisfaction and performance (0.30), while two \nother studies found positive but small correlations.\nOrganisational commitment\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 40 studies, 10 of \nwhich met the inclusion criteria.175,176,754\u2013761 An \nadditional meta-analysis that satisfied these criteria \nwas identified by reference-tracking of included \nmeta-analyses.669 The definition of organisational \ncommitment used by these studies is within the \nbroad definition outlined in Chapter 4:\n\u2022\t The various meta-analyses performed by \nCooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran754 were \nbased on findings from 997 articles, which \nincluded correlations between organisational \ncommitment and career commitment, job \nsatisfaction and turnover intentions. The \nprimary studies used many different measures \nto measure these correlates.\n\u2022\t Meyer et al. 669 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 155 samples from both published and \nunpublished studies. The meta-analysis \nreported correlations between organisational \ncommitment and the following intermediate \noutcomes of interest: justice, occupational \ncommitment, job satisfaction and pay \nsatisfaction. The analysis only included data \nfrom studies that used one or more of the \ncommitment measures (affective, continuance \nor normative) developed by Allen and Meyer,741 \nMeyer and Allen174,477,762 or Meyer et al.763\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This meta-analysis did not \nspecify particular measures as an inclusion \ncriterion, but 132 of the samples assessed \nattitudinal commitment, 28 assessed calculative \ncommitment, and 14 either combined the two \nor assessed another type of commitment.\n\u2022\t Cohen and Gattiker756 conducted a meta-\nanalysis of 27 studies (31 samples) examining \ncorrelations with pay satisfaction, a dimension \nof job satisfaction. Once again, this meta-\nanalysis did not specify particular measures as \nan inclusion criteria.\n\u2022\t Wallace176 conducted a meta-analysis of 25 \nstudies (25 samples) and reported data on \ncorrelations with organisational commitment \nonly. Particular measures were not specified as \ninclusion criteria.\n\u2022\t Cohen758 conducted a meta-analysis of 30 \nstudies (41 samples) and reported data on \ncorrelations with turnover intentions, although \nno particular measures were specified as \ninclusion criteria.\n\u2022\t Randall760 conducted a meta-analysis of 35 \nstudies (35 samples), but reported no data \non correlations between organisational \ncommitment and the intermediate outcomes of \ninterest to this study.\n\u2022\t The meta-analyses of Cohen175 and Cohen \nand Hudecek757 also did not correlate \norganisational commitment with any outcomes \nof interest.\n\u2022\t Finally, Ferris and Aranya761 reported \ncorrelations between different organisational \ncommitment scales and intention to quit, job \nsatisfaction and professional commitment. \nHowever, this was an analysis of their own \nsample, rather than a meta-analysis of two or \nmore samples.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nNone of the meta-analyses that satisfied the \ninclusion criteria for this review were of high \nquality, but the methodological quality of several \nwas moderate.\nThe meta-analyses of Cooper-Hakim and \nViswesvaran,754 Meyer et al.,669 Colquitt et al.,755 \nWallace,176 and Mathieu and Zajac759 were all \nof similar moderate quality. Only extractor \nbias was high in the analysis of Meyer et al.669 \nbecause information was not given on coding of \nthe studies. Publication and selection bias were \nlow, and moderator analysis was used to test the \neffect on the results of using different measures \nof organisational commitment. The potential for \nselection bias was high in the meta-analysis of \nMathieu and Zajac759 but the scope for publication \nand extractor bias was low, and moderator analyses \nwere performed by type of commitment. The \nmeta-analysis of Wallace176 was of similar quality. \nIt was also subject to low publication and selection \nbias, but the potential for extractor bias was high. \nHowever, moderator analyses were performed \nby testing for the effect on the results of the \nprofessionalism, position or occupation of the \nsample, and for the scale used.\nIn the meta-analysis of Cooper-Hakim and \nViswesvaran,754 the potential for selection bias was \nlow and both data collection and coding were high \nquality, so publication and extractor bias were \nlow. No test for homogeneity was performed, but \nan appropriate random effects model was used. \nNo moderator analysis was performed to test \nthe robustness of the results. The meta-analysis \nof Colquitt et al.755 was of slightly lower quality, \nhaving low selection and extractor bias, but high \npublication bias because it consisted only of a \nhand-search of named journals and contacting \nexperts in the field: there was no search of \nelectronic databases or sources of grey literature. \nNo test of homogeneity was performed, but the \nrandom effects model of Hunter and Schmidt736 \nwas used. No moderator analyses were performed.\nMethodologically, the weakest meta-analyses were \nconducted by Cohen758 and Cohen and Gattiker.756 \nExtractor bias was high in both because no \ninformation was given on how the coding process \nwas performed. Selection bias was high in Cohen758 \nbecause no information was given, and publication \nbias was also high because the only information \nprovided on how this meta-analysis identified \nincluded studies was the performance of \u2018both \nmanual and computer-assisted searches of social \nscience, psychology and managerial literature\u2019. \nPublication, selection and extractor bias were all \nhigh in Cohen and Gattiker.756 However, moderator \nanalyses were performed by both meta-analyses.\nAppendix 11 \n326\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 40 \nstudies, 11 of which met the inclusion \ncriteria.162,175,744,745,754,757\u2013760,764,765 Three additional \nmeta-analyses that satisfied these criteria were \nidentified by reference tracking of included meta-\nanalyses:669,750,752\n\u2022\t The meta-analyses performed by Cooper-\nHakim and Viswesvaran,754 as mentioned in \nthe previous section, were based on findings \nfrom 997 articles, which included correlations \nbetween organisational commitment and \nturnover, in addition to the correlations with \nintermediate outcomes described previously. \nDalal744 conducted a meta-analysis of 38 studies \n(49 samples), and reported data on correlations \nbetween organisational commitment and an \noverall score for the six dimensions of OCB. \nThis meta-analysis did not specify particular \nmeasures or characteristics of measures as \ninclusion criteria.\n\u2022\t Meyer et al.669 conducted a meta-analysis of 155 \nsamples and, in addition to the correlations \nwith intermediate outcomes mentioned above, \nreported correlations between organisational \ncommitment and OCB.\n\u2022\t LePine et al.745 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 37 studies (37 samples), reporting data \non correlations between organisational \ncommitment and an overall score for the six \ndimensions of OCB (altruism, civic virtue, \ncourtesy, sportsmanship, compliance and \nconscientiousness).\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis of Riketta765 was based \non 93 published studies (111 independent \nsamples) and reported correlations between \nattitudinal organisational commitment and job \nperformance.\n\u2022\t Organ and Ryan162 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 55 studies (55 samples). They reported \ndata on correlations between organisational \ncommitment and five dimensions of OCB \n(altruism, civic virtue, courtesy, sportsmanship, \nand compliance, but not conscientiousness).\n\u2022\t Cohen758 conducted a meta-analysis of 30 \nstudies (41 samples) and reported data on \ncorrelations with turnover and performance, \nalongside the correlation mentioned previously \nin relation to organisational commitment and \nintermediate outcomes. This meta-analysis did \nnot specify particular measures as an inclusion \ncriterion.\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis of Mathieu and Zajac,759 \nas mentioned in the previous section, was \nbased on 124 studies (174 independent \nsamples). Correlations between organisational \ncommitment and both turnover and job \nperformance (as rated by others) were \nreported.\n\u2022\t Randall760 conducted a meta-analysis of 35 \nstudies (35 samples) and, despite including \nno data in relation to correlations with \nthe intermediate behaviours of interest, \nreported correlations between organisational \ncommitment and the final outcomes of \nperformance, attendance and remaining in the \norganisation (the last two being the inverse of \nthe absence and turnover variables).\n\u2022\t The meta-analyses of Cohen175 and Cohen \nand Hudecek757 both reported corrected \ncorrelations from 24 studies (36 samples) for \nturnover and organisational commitment.\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis of Farrell and Stamm750 was \nbased on 72 studies and reported correlations \nbetween organisational commitment and the \nabsence variables of total time lost and absence \nfrequency.\n\u2022\t Steel and Ovalle752 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 34 studies and reported data on correlations \nbetween organisational commitment and the \nfinal outcome of turnover.\n\u2022\t The analysis of Wright and Bonett764 was not \na true meta-analysis because it only reported \nthe correlation coefficients of organisational \ncommitment and performance in identified \nstudies, rather than providing an overall \ncorrected correlation.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nOne of the meta-analyses that satisfied the \ninclusion criteria for this review was of high \nquality,765 but the methodological quality of many \nwas good or moderate.\nThe meta-analysis of Riketta765 was of high quality: \npublication, selection and extractor bias were all \nlow, and although no search was performed to \nidentify unpublished material, a clear rationale \nfor this was given. A test for homogeneity was \nperformed and a random effects model was \nused for the analysis. Moderator analyses were \nalso performed, including population, type of \nperformance, and different performance and \ncommitment measures.\nThe meta-analyses of Dalal744 and Organ and \nRyan162 were both good methodologically. \nPublication bias was moderate in both because \nonly a small number of databases or grey literature \nsources were searched. Selection and extractor \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n327\nbias were both low, and each study also performed \nmoderator analyses.\nPotential publication bias was only moderate in \nthe study of LePine et al.,745 as grey literature was \nsearched and relevant authors were contacted. \nInclusion criteria were clear, so selection bias was \nlow. A test for homogeneity was performed and \na random effects model was used. Moderator \nanalyses were also performed by testing for the \neffect on the results of using different measures of \nOCB and measuring different dimensions of this \nconcept. Only extractor bias was high.\nThe meta-analyses of Cooper-Hakim and \nViswesvaran,754 Meyer et al.669 and Mathieu and \nZajac759 were all of moderate quality. Details \nof biases in these analyses are described in the \nprevious section.\nRandall760 had low publication bias (a test was \nperformed to demonstrate this) and selection bias, \nbut high extractor bias because no information \nwas provided on how the coding was performed. \nThis meta-analysis used a random effects model \nand performed moderator analyses to test for \nthe effect on the results of excluding different \ncommitment and performance measures, and \ncertain populations, from the analysis.\nThe weaker meta-analyses, methodologically, were \nconducted by Cohen and Hudecek,757 Cohen,175,758 \nFarrell and Stamm750 and Steel and Ovalle.752 \nExtractor bias was high in all because information \nwas not given on how the coding process was \nperformed. Publication bias was moderate in \nCohen and Hudecek,757 Cohen,175 and Farrell \nand Stamm750 because databases were searched, \nand other information retrieval methods, such as \nreference-tracking and hand-searching of journals, \nwere used, but no grey literature sources were \nsearched. Publication bias was high in Steel and \nOvalle752 because the literature search performed \nwas so limited. However, selection bias was low \nin Cohen,175 Farrell and Stamm750 and Steel and \nOvalle752 because inclusion criteria were given. \nSelection bias was high in Cohen and Hudecek757 \nand Cohen758 because no information regarding \ninclusion criteria was reported. As mentioned \npreviously, publication bias was also high in \nCohen758 because very little information was \nprovided with regard to how studies to be included \nin the meta-analysis were identified. However, some \nmoderator analyses, based on the age, tenure, \nprofession or time to turnover of the sample \npopulation, were performed.\nThe analyses of Cohen and Hudecek757 and \nCohen175 essentially reported the same data.\nResults\nA relatively high number of organisational \ncommitment meta-analyses were included for \nreview, so we report just on those studies of \nreasonable quality (although still with multiple \nsources of bias). Organisational commitment \nhad a large negative relationship with turnover \nintentions and a large positive association with job \nsatisfaction, organisational support, and motivation \n(although this last relationship is from a small \nnumber of studies in a single meta-analysis). There \nare moderate to high positive associations with \norganisational justice and job involvement.\nSimilarly, with regards meta-analyses reporting \nassociations between organisational commitment \nand behaviours, only those studies of reasonable \nquality have been included here. Organisational \ncommitment had small to moderate positive \ncorrelations with OCB, small positive correlations \nwith performance, and a small to moderate \nnegative association with turnover.\nProfessional\/occupational \ncommitment\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nThe literature search identified three studies, \ntwo of which met the inclusion criteria.176,177 The \ndefinition of professional commitment used by \nthese studies falls within the broad definition \noutlined in Chapter 4:\n\u2022\t Lee et al.177 conducted a meta-analysis of \n76 studies (77 samples), reporting data on \ncorrelations between professional commitment \nand the following intermediate outcomes \nof interest: job satisfaction, burnout and \norganisational commitment. The inclusion \ncriteria required a consistent definition of \noccupation commitment, so only studies using \nspecified scales were included.\n\u2022\t Wallace176 conducted a meta-analysis of 25 \nstudies (25 samples) and reported data on \ncorrelations with organisational commitment \nonly. This meta-analysis did not specify \nparticular measures as inclusion criteria, but \nalmost one-half of the included studies used \na version of the organisational commitment \nquestionnaire (OCQ), with the word \n\u2018organisation\u2019 being substituted with the word \n\u2018professional\u2019.\nAppendix 11 \n328\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThese two meta-analyses were both of moderate \nquality. The study of Lee et al.177 was good. It \nwas subject to only moderate publication bias, \nlow selection and extractor bias, and moderator \nanalyses were performed by testing the effect on \nthe results of whether the sample was professional \nor non-professional. The meta-analysis of Wallace176 \nwas of only slightly lower quality. It was also subject \nto low publication and selection bias, but the \npotential for extractor bias was high. However, \nmoderator analyses were performed, testing for the \neffect on the results of the professionalism, position \nor occupation of the sample, and for the scale used.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified three studies, two \nof which met the inclusion criteria:177,754\n\u2022\t Lee et al.741 conducted a meta-analysis of \n76 studies (77 samples). Alongside the \nintermediate outcomes already discussed, \ndata on correlations between professional \ncommitment and the organisational behaviours \nof supervisor-rated performance and turnover \nwere reported.\n\u2022\t The multiple meta-analyses conducted by \nCooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran754 were based \non findings from 997 articles. Correlations \nbetween occupational commitment and both \nturnover and performance were reported.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nBoth of the meta-analyses included were of \nmoderate quality. The study of Lee et al.177 was \nof good quality (see previous section for further \ndetails). The potential for selection bias in the \nstudy of Cooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran754 was low \nto moderate because the inclusion criteria were \nlimited and not specific. Publication and extractor \nbias were also low, as both data collection and \ncoding were of high quality. Although a test for \nhomogeneity was not performed, an appropriate \nrandom effects model was used. Moderator \nanalyses were not performed.\nResults\nThe meta-analyses of both Lee et al.177 and \nWallace176 found large positive correlations between \nprofessional commitment and organisational \ncommitment. Lee et al.177 also reported a strong \npositive association with job satisfaction (0.44) and \na strong negative association with burnout (\u20130.44), \nalthough it is important to acknowledge that \nthese data came from a single meta-analysis only, \nalbeit of good quality. In relation to organisational \nbehaviours, Lee et al.177 and Cooper-Hakim and \nViswesvaran754 reported professional commitment \nto have a weak negative association with turnover, \nand a very weak to weak positive relationship with \nperformance.\nEngagement\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nNo meta-analyses of engagement satisfied the \ninclusion criteria.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified one study that met \nthe inclusion criteria:746\n\u2022\t Harter et al.746 conducted a meta-analysis of \n42 studies across 36 organisations conducted \nby the Gallup Organization. They reported \ndata on correlations between engagement and \nturnover (measured as a dimension of business \nunit performance).\nCritical appraisal of meta-analysis\nIn terms of methodology, this was a low-\nquality meta-analysis. Publication bias was high \nbecause only studies undertaken by the Gallup \nOrganization were included. Some selection criteria \nwere applied to the small pool of available studies, \nalthough these were limited. Information was not \ngiven on coding of data, so extractor bias may have \nbeen high. However, the form of analysis was good: \na random effects model was used, and subgroup \nanalyses were performed.\nResults\nThis meta-analysis found a moderate negative \ncorrelation between engagement and employee \nturnover (\u20130.30), with turnover considered to be a \nconsequence of engagement. Nevertheless, these \nfindings should be treated with caution, as the \nmeta-analysis was of low quality.\nBurnout\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 37 studies, two \nof which met the inclusion criteria.186,766 The \ndefinition of burnout used by these studies is within \nthe broad definition outlined in Chapter 4:\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n329\n\u2022\t Lee and Ashforth186 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 61 studies (61 samples). They reported \ndata on correlations between the three \ndimensions of burnout, namely emotional \nexhaustion, depersonalisation and personal \naccomplishment (based on the Maslach \nBurnout Inventory, MBI), and the intermediate \noutcomes of job satisfaction, organisational \ncommitment, job involvement and turnover \nintentions.\n\u2022\t Melchior et al.766 conducted a meta-analysis \nof nine studies. The small number of studies \nis due to the inclusion criteria: the studies \nincluded in this meta-analysis had to be \ncomposed of nurses engaged in psychiatric \npatient care. Further, the only variable of \ninterest in this meta-analysis with reported \ndata on correlations was job satisfaction, and \nthe mean corrected correlation statistic for this \nvariable was based on three studies only. Two of \nthese studies used the MBI as their measure of \nburnout, and one used the Tedium Measure of \nPines et al.250\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThe meta-analyses of Melchior et al.766 and Lee and \nAshforth186 were both of low-to-moderate quality. \nBoth used a random effects model, although \nneither tested for homogeneity of effect sizes. \nThe potential degree of publication, selection \nand extractor bias in both studies was moderate \nonly: some effort was taken to identify all relevant \nstudies, to select relevant studies, and extract \ndata with limited bias or error, but more could \nhave been done. Also, neither study performed a \nmoderator or sensitivity analysis, so the robustness \nof the findings was not tested.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 37 studies, one of \nwhich met the inclusion criteria:46\n\u2022\t Taris46 conducted a meta-analysis of 16 studies, \nreporting correlations between two of the \ndimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion \nand depersonalisation) and OCB.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThe meta-analysis of Taris46 was of low quality. \nThere was a high degree of potential publication \nbias because only a single database was searched, \nand no other methods of information retrieval were \nused. However, potential selection bias was low \nbecause clear inclusion criteria were given, but no \ninformation was given on coding and the analyst \nhad only a single author so extractor bias was high. \nA random effects model was used, but, again, there \nwas no test for homogeneity of effect sizes and no \nmoderator analyses were performed.\nResults\nThe meta-analyses of both Melchior et al.766 and \nLee and Ashforth186 reported medium to large \nnegative relationships between the burnout \n(overall burnout and the dimensions of emotional \nexhaustion and depersonalisation for each study, \nrespectively) and job satisfaction. Although only \nreported by Lee and Ashforth,186 the correlations \nbetween burnout (emotional exhaustion and \ndepersonalisation) and organisational commitment \nwere negative and of moderate strength, while \npositive moderate to strong relationships with \nturnover intentions and negative very small to \nvery large associations with job involvement were \nalso reported. Taris46 found weak to moderate \nnegative associations between two dimensions of \nburnout and OCB. Nevertheless, the conclusions \ndrawn must be treated with caution, as these meta-\nanalyses had multiple sources of bias.\nJob involvement\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nThe literature search identified eight studies, two \nof which met the inclusion:189,754\n\u2022\t Brown189 conducted a meta-analysis of 212 \nstudies (249 independent samples). The meta-\nanalysis reported correlations between job \ninvolvement and the following intermediate \noutcomes of interest: organisational \ncommitment, turnover intentions, job \nsatisfaction and pay satisfaction. The primary \nstudies used many different measures to \nmeasure these correlates.\n\u2022\t Cooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran754 carried \nout multiple meta-analyses based on findings \nfrom 997 articles. Correlations were reported \nbetween job involvement and organisational \ncommitment, career commitment, job \nsatisfaction and turnover intentions. The \nprimary studies used many different measures \nto measure these correlates.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThe meta-analyses that satisfied the inclusion \ncriteria for this review were all were of reasonable \nand comparable methodological quality. The \nanalysis of Brown189 was of slightly higher quality \nAppendix 11 \n330\nthan the two other meta-analyses: there was a \nmoderate degree of publication bias because \nonly one database of peer-reviewed journals and \nno grey literature sources were searched, but \nthe search strategy was good and both hand-\nsearching of journals and reference tracking were \nperformed. The inclusion criteria were also limited, \nintroducing moderate potential selection bias, but \ncoding was rigorous so the potential for extractor \nbias was low. Brown,189 unlike Cooper-Hakim \nand Viswesvaran,754 also performed a moderator \nanalysis (to test the effect of different measures \nof job involvement) and, therefore, the findings \nof Brown189 are the most robust in this group of \nstudies.\nThe potential for selection bias in the meta-\nanalysis of Cooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran754 \nwas moderate because the inclusion criteria were \nlimited and unspecific, whereas both publication \nand extractor bias were low because data collection \nand coding were of high quality. Although no test \nfor homogeneity was performed, an appropriate \nrandom effects model was used.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified eight studies, \ntwo of which met the inclusion criteria.189,754 A \nfurther meta-analysis was identified by reference-\ntracking:750\n\u2022\t Brown,189 as mentioned in the previous \nsection, conducted a meta-analysis of 212 \nstudies (249 independent samples), reporting \ncorrelations between job involvement and the \nfollowing organisational behaviours of interest: \nperformance, absence and turnover.\n\u2022\t The various meta-analyses performed by \nCooper-Hakim and Viswesvaran754 were based \non findings from 997 articles, which reported, \nin addition to the correlations mentioned \npreviously in relation to intermediate \noutcomes, correlations between job \ninvolvement and turnover.\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis of Farrell and Stamm750 was \nbased on 72 studies and reported correlations \nbetween job involvement and the absence \nvariables of total time lost and absence \nfrequency.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThe meta-analyses that satisfied the inclusion \ncriteria for this review were all were of reasonable \nand comparable methodological quality. The \nanalysis of Brown189 was of slightly higher quality \nthan the two other meta-analyses (see previous \nsection for critical appraisal details).\nFarrell and Stamm750 had moderate publication \nbias because several techniques were used to \nfind the evidence and databases were searched, \nalthough database names were not given. However, \nno searches of formal grey literature sources were \nreported. Inclusion criteria were given, so selection \nbias was low, but extractor bias was high because no \ninformation was provided on the coding process. \nA random effects model was used, and some \nmoderator analyses were performed, based on the \noccupational status of the sampled population.\nIn the meta-analyses of Cooper-Hakim and \nViswesvaran,754 both publication and extractor bias \nwere low, as data collection and coding were of high \nquality, and the potential for selection bias was low \nto moderate because the inclusion criteria were \nlimited and none specific. No test for homogeneity \nwas performed, but an appropriate random \neffects model was used. Moderator analyses were \nnot performed beyond the focus on the different \ndimensions of the measurement of organisational \ncommitment.\nResults\nLarge positive correlations were found between \njob involvement and overall organisational \ncommitment, while medium to large positive \ncorrelations were found between job involvement \nand satisfaction. Turnover intentions were reported \nto have a moderate negative association with job \ninvolvement.\nSmall negative relationships were reported with \nturnover and small to large negative relationships \nwere found with absence. Brown189 also reported \na very small positive correlation between job \ninvolvement and performance. However, \nconclusions drawn from these findings must be \ntreated with caution, as all meta-analyses were \nsubject to multiple biases.\nTurnover intentions\nNo meta-analyses of turnover intentions satisfied \nthe inclusion criteria for intermediate outcomes or \norganisational behaviours.\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n331\nOrganisational justice\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 23 studies, only \ntwo of which met the inclusion criteria.202,670 The \ndefinition of justice or fairness used by these \nstudies falls within the broad definition outlined in \nChapter 4:\n\u2022\t Cohen-Charash and Spector202 conducted a \nmeta-analysis of 190 studies (190 samples). \nThey reported data on correlations between \nperceived distributive and procedural justice \nand the following intermediate outcomes of \ninterest: job satisfaction (intrinsic, extrinsic \nand pay), trust, turnover intentions and \norganisational commitment. The inclusion \ncriteria required the use of \u2018specific measures of \nperceived \u2026 justice\u2019, but these were not named.\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis of Colquitt et al.670 was \nperformed on 183 studies (183 samples), \nand reported correlations on the following \nattitudinal and behavioural outcomes of \ninterest: organisational commitment, job \nsatisfaction and trust. Studies need not have \nused particular measures of justice to be \nincluded.\nWitt and Nye743 conducted a meta-analysis on their \nown sample of 56 correlations using their own \ncomposite scale, and so this study was excluded.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nNeither of the two meta-analyses included were of \nhigh quality in terms of methodology. The meta-\nanalysis of Cohen-Charash and Spector202 had \nlow publication and selection bias, but extractor \nbias was potentially high (no information was \ngiven about the coding process). Also, no test for \nhomogeneity was performed, even though the \nanalysis used a fixed effects model.767 However, \nmoderator analyses were performed by testing for \nthe effect on the results of the included study had \nbeen conducted in a \u2018laboratory\u2019 or in the field.\nIn the meta-analysis of Colquitt et al.670 both \nselection and extractor bias were low. However, the \nstudy was open to greater publication bias because \nonly one database of peer-reviewed articles and \nno grey literature sources were searched, and few \nadditional information retrieval techniques were \nused. Although Colquitt et al.670 performed no \ntest for homogeneity, the random effects model \nof Hunter and Schmidt736 was used. Moderator \nanalyses were also performed.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified 23 studies, five of \nwhich met the inclusion criteria:162,202,670,744,745\n\u2022\t Dalal744 conducted a meta-analysis of 38 studies \n(49 samples) and LePine et al.745 a meta-analysis \nof 37 studies (37 samples). Both reported \ndata on correlations between overall scores of \norganisational justice and an overall score for \nOCB.\n\u2022\t Cohen-Charash and Spector202 conducted a \nmeta-analysis of 190 studies (190 samples), \nreporting data on correlations between \nperceived distributive and procedural justice \nand work performance (field and laboratory \nstudies) and OCB (including several of its \ndimensions). Work performance was measured \nby a variety of scales, but it is unclear whether \nthis was always organisational performance or \nindividual task performance (p. 290).\n\u2022\t The meta-analysis of Colquitt et al.670 again \nmentioned in the previous section in relation \nto correlations with intermediate outcomes, \nwas performed on 183 studies (183 samples) \nand reported correlations between justice and \nperformance, withdrawal (turnover) and OCB \n(organisational and individual). Again, the \nnature of performance being measured was not \nclear.\n\u2022\t Organ and Ryan162 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 55 studies (55 samples), reporting data on \ncorrelations between fairness and OCB (an \noverall score and the dimensions of altruism \nand generalised compliance).\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThe meta-analyses of Dalal744 and Organ and \nRyan162 were both good methodologically. \nPublication bias was moderate in both cases \nbecause only a small number of databases \nor grey literature sources were searched, but \nselection and extractor bias were low. Both \nstudies also performed moderator analyses. The \nmethodological quality of the meta-analysis by \nLePine et al.745 was also good. There was only \nmoderate potential publication bias because a \nsearch for grey literature was conducted and \nrelevant authors were contacted. Selection bias was \nlow because inclusion criteria were clear. LePine \net al.745 also performed a test for homogeneity, \nused a random effects model for the analysis, and \nperformed moderator analyses by testing for the \neffect on the results of using different measures of \nOCB and measuring different dimensions of this \nconcept. Only extractor bias was high.\nAppendix 11 \n332\nThe meta-analyses of Cohen-Charash and \nSpector202 and Colquitt et al.670 were of slightly \nlower quality (see previous section for details).\nResults\nThe two meta-analyses concerning relationships \nbetween organisational justice and intermediate \noutcomes202,670 reported large positive correlations \nbetween justice and organisational commitment \n(affective and overall), job satisfaction and trust. \nCohen-Charash and Spector202 also found a strong \nnegative association with turnover intentions \n(\u20130.40). However, neither study was of high quality.\nWith regards organisational behaviours, all five \nstudies reported positive correlations between \norganisational justice and OCB, ranging in \nstrength from weak to moderate. Cohen-Charash \nand Spector202 and Colquitt et al.670 found small \nassociations between distributive justice and \nperformance and medium to large associations \nbetween procedural justice and performance. The \nmeta-analysis of Colquitt et al.670 also reported \nlarge negative relationships with turnover (\u20130.50 \nand \u20130.46 for distributive and procedural justice, \nrespectively).\nOrganisational support\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes\nStudies\nThe literature search identified one study that \nmet the inclusion criteria.208 They conducted \na meta-analysis of 73 studies, reporting \ncorrelations between perceived organisational \nsupport (as measured by the Survey of Perceived \nOrganisational Support, SPOS; Eisenberger et \nal.206) and the following intermediate outcomes \nof interest: procedural justice, organisational \ncommitment, job satisfaction, job involvement and \nturnover intentions.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThis meta-analysis was of high quality. There was \nonly a low degree of potential publication, selection \nand extractor bias because a full range of sources \nwere searched for published and unpublished \nstudies using various methods, specific inclusion \ncriteria were applied, and coding was monitored. \nA random effects model was used, after testing for \nhomogeneity of effect sizes. No moderator analysis \nwas performed (based on organisation type).\nCorrelations with behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified one study that met \nthe inclusion criteria:208\n\u2022\t As reported in the previous section, Rhoades \nand Eisenberger208 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 73 studies, reporting correlations between \nperceived organisational support (as measured \nby the SPOS; Eisenberger et al.206) and the \nbehaviours of performance, OCB and turnover, \nin addition to the correlations previously \nmentioned.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThis meta-analysis was of high quality (see previous \ncritical appraisal section for details).\nResults\nRhoades and Eisenberger208 reported strong, \npositive correlations between organisational \nsupport and procedural justice (0.59), \norganisational commitment (0.67) and job \nsatisfaction (0.62). The relationship with job \ninvolvement was positive and of moderate strength \n(0.32), whilst the association with turnover \nintentions was strong and negative (\u20130.51). \nWeak positive correlations were found between \norganisational support and job performance (0.18), \nand OCB (0.22), and a weak negative correlation \nwith turnover (\u20130.11).\nAlthough it is not possible to infer causality from \nthe correlations, Rhoades and Eisenbeger208 \nclassify procedural justice as an antecedent \nof organisational support, and organisational \ncommitment, job satisfaction, job involvement \nand turnover as consequences of organisational \nsupport.\nOrganisational climate\nCorrelations with other intermediate \noutcomes and behaviours\nStudies\nThe literature search identified two studies that \nmet the inclusion criteria for the intermediate \noutcomes of interest:673,674\n\u2022\t Carr et al.673 conducted a meta-analysis \nof 51 studies (70 samples), and reported \ncorrelations between the three facets of climate \nproposed by Ostroff675 \u2013 affective, cognitive \nand instrumental climate perceptions \u2013 and \nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14510 Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 51\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n333\nbetween each facet and job satisfaction \norganisational commitment and psychological \nwell-being. The primary studies used many \ndifferent measures to determine these \ncorrelates.\n\u2022\t Parker et al.674 conducted a meta-analysis of 94 \nstudies (121 samples), reporting correlations \nbetween the five facets of psychological climate \nperceptions proposed by James et al. (e.g. Jones \nand James676) \u2013 job, role, leadership, work \ngroup and organisation \u2013 and between the five \nfacets and job satisfaction, job involvement, \ncommitment, psychological well-being and \nmotivation.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nThis meta-analysis of Carr et al.673 was of moderate \nquality. Potential selection and extractor bias were \nboth low. The potential degree of publication bias \nwas moderate because although hand-searching \nof specific journals and reference-tracking was \nperformed, only one electronic database and no \ngrey literature were searched, and no information \nwas provided on the search strategy used. A \nfixed effects model was used, after testing for \nhomogeneity of effect sizes. Only path analysis, and \nnot moderator analysis, was performed.\nThis meta-analysis of Parker et al.674 was also of \nmoderate quality. Potential selection and extractor \nbias were both low, as specific inclusion criteria and \na high consistency score between five raters were \nreported. Potential publication bias was moderate \nbecause although clear search terms were included \nand reference-tracking was performed, only one \nelectronic database, and no grey literature, was \nsearched. The random effects model of Hunter and \nSchmidt736 was used, but no test for homogeneity \nwas conducted and only path analyses, and not \nmoderator analyses, were performed.\nCorrelations with behaviours\nThe literature search identified two studies that \nmet the inclusion criteria:673,674\n\u2022\t As previously described, Carr et al.\u2019s673 meta-\nanalysis of 51 studies (70 samples) reported \ncorrelations between affective, cognitive and \ninstrumental climate perceptions and between \neach of these climate dimensions and job \nperformance and withdrawal (turnover).\n\u2022\t Parker et al.674 conducted a meta-analysis of 94 \nstudies (121 samples), reporting correlations \nbetween the climate dimensions of job, role, \nleadership, work group and organisation and, \nin addition to the correlations mentioned \nabove, between these dimensions and \nperformance.\nCritical appraisal of meta-analyses\nBoth meta-analyses were of moderate quality (see \nprevious critical appraisal section for details).\nResults\nThe meta-analysis by Carr et al.673 found large \npositive relationships between affective climate and \njob satisfaction (0.46) and instrumental climate \nand job satisfaction (0.44), and a medium positive \ncorrelation between cognitive climate perceptions \nand job satisfaction (0.33). Medium positive \ncorrelations were reported between the three \nclimate facets and organisational commitment \n(affective, 0.34; cognitive, 0.28; instrumental, 0.26). \nA very weak relationship was reported between \ncognitive climate perceptions and well-being \n(0.07), while weak relationships were reported \nbetween affective and instrumental climate and \nwell-being (0.17 and 0.11, respectively). Job \nperformance was found to have very weak positive \nassociations with climate (affective, 0.9; cognitive, \n0.5; instrumental, 0.5), while turnover had a very \nweak negative association with cognitive climate \n(\u20130.07) and moderate negative associations with \naffective (\u20130.28) and instrumental (\u20130.33) climate \nperceptions. For further analysis and interpretation \nof the findings, see Chapter 9 (Correlations \nbetween climate, other intermediate outcomes and \nemployee behaviours).\nThe meta-analysis by Parker et al.674 reported \nlarge, positive correlations between the climate \nfacets of leader, work group and organisation and \njob satisfaction (0.41, 0.48, 0.42, respectively), \na medium, positive correlation between role \ncharacteristics and job satisfaction (0.28), \nand a small, positive correlation between job \ncharacteristics and satisfaction (0.21). Job \ninvolvement and commitment were grouped \ntogether to form the dimension of \u2018job attitudes\u2019. \nJob attitudes was found to have a small, positive \nrelationship with role characteristics (0.22), and \nmedium, positive relationships with job (0.26), \nleader (0.32), work group (0.27) and organisation \n(0.36) characteristics. A strong, positive association \nwas reported between leader characteristics \nand well-being (0.44), while moderate, positive \nassociations were reported between role, job, \nwork group and organisation characteristics and \nAppendix 11 \n334\nwell-being (0.26, 0.35, 0.35, 0.29, respectively). \nThe relationship between role characteristics and \nperformance was found to be very weak (0.06), \nwhile the relationships between job, leader, work \ngroup and organisation characteristics with \nperformance were all reported to be small (0.10, \n0.16, 0.12, 0.13, respectively). Motivation was \nfound to have a very weak correlation with role \ncharacteristics (0.09), and small correlations with \njob (0.20), leader (0.21), work group (0.20), and \norganisation (0.22) dimensions. See Table 59 for a \nsummary of these correlations.
