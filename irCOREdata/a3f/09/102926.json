However, the net effect of\nfood groups on alkali\/acid loading in population groups is unclear. The aims of the present study were to: (1) quantify estimates of daily net\nendogenous acid production (NEAP) (mEq\/d) in a representative group of British elderly aged 65 years and older; (2) compare and characterise\nNEAP by specific nutrients and food groups likely to influence dietary acid loading; (3) determine whether geographical location influenced\nNEAP. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey dataset, consisting of a 4 d weighed record and anthropometric data, was used to estimate dietary\nacidity. Dietary under-reporters were excluded by analysing only subjects with energy intakes $1\u00b72 \u00a3 BMR. NEAP was estimated as the dietary\npotential renal acid load \u00fe organic acid excretion, the latter as a multiple of estimated body surface area. NEAP was lower in women compared\nwith men (P,0\u00b7001), and lower than values reported in a Swedish elderly cohort. Lower dietary acidity was significantly associated with higher\nconsumption of fruit and potatoes and lower consumption of meat, bread and eggs (P,0\u00b702 to P,0\u00b7001). Lower intakes of fish and cheese were\nassociated with lower NEAP in men only (P,0\u00b701 to P,0\u00b7001). There were regional differences for NEAP, with higher intakes in Scotland\/\nNorthern regions compared with Central\/South-Western and London\/South-Eastern regions (P\u00bc0\u00b701). These data provide an insight into the\nacid-generating potential of the diet in the British elderly population, which may have important consequences in this vulnerable group.\nNet endogenous acid production: Acid\u2013base balance: Food groups: British elderly\nAcid\u2013base homeostasis is critical to health; examples of\nthe negative health effects of increases in acid loading or\nacidosis include growth retardation of babies, decline in\nsports performance and increased atrophy and loss of muscle\nmass(1\u20134). There is increasing evidence to suggest that even\nsmall disturbances in acid\u2013base homeostasis have deleterious\neffects on bone remodelling in the animal\/cellular model, and\nmay be a risk factor for osteoporosis especially given that a\nhigh dietary acid load may have a negative effect on bone\nhealth by increasing Ca excretion and bone resorption(5\u20138).\nIn addition, dietary acid loading can have detrimental health\noutcomes through an increased urinary N loss and nephro-\nlithiasis(9,10). Currently, there is a general consensus that\ndiet can undoubtedly affect acid\u2013base balance and that an\nindividual\u2019s net acid load can be specifically modified by\ndietary intervention(11\u201313).\nRenal net acid excretion can be measured directly with\n24 h urine collection, but this is impractical in large popu-\nlation groups. A more practical indirect measurement of\nacid\u2013base balance in healthy individuals has been developed\nthat relies on predictions using validated formulae from nutri-\nent intake data. However, several algorithms for estimating\nthe daily net endogenous acid production (NEAP) from the\ndietary composition of foods have been proposed by different\ninvestigators(10). One such validated measurement was deve-\nloped by Remer et al. and estimates the dietary potential\nrenal acid load (PRAL), together with an assumed urinary\nexcretion rate of organic acids (OA) which is predicted\nfrom body surface area (BSA)(2). Since Remer and Frassetto\nhave demonstrated that diets rich in protein precursors cause\nan increase in acidity and, conversely, diets rich in K\n(organic anions) have an alkalising effect(10), a simpler\n*Corresponding author: Mr Richard Gannon, fax \u00fe44 1483 686401, email r.gannon@surrey.ac.uk\nAbbreviations: BSA, body surface area; IQR, interquartile range; NDNS, National Diet and Nutrition Survey; NEAP, net endogenous acid production; OA, organic\nacid; PRAL, potential renal acid load.\nBritish Journal of Nutrition (2008), 100, 615\u2013623 doi:10.1017\/S0007114508901240\nq The Authors 2008\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nalgorithm, based on the protein:K ratio, has been formulated\nby Frassetto et al.(11).\nThe principal aims of the present analysis were to: (1)\nquantify estimates of NEAP in a national representative\nsample of British elderly men and women aged 65 years\nand older categorised by different age groups and between\nsexes; (2) compare and characterise NEAP in relation to\nfood groups likely to influence dietary acid; (3) determine\nwhether geographical location in the UK influenced estimates\nof NEAP.\nMethodology\nThe National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) is an ongoing\njoint initiative established in 1990 by the UK Ministry of\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of\nHealth. The aims of the NDNS are to provide a comprehensive\ncross-sectional representation of the dietary habits and nutri-\ntional status of the population of Great Britain. The survey\nprovides quantitative data on food and nutrient intakes\n(4 d weighed diet record), anthropometric measurements,\ndemographic and lifestyle characteristics and other related\nbiochemical indices.\nThe present study focuses on the NDNS for individuals\naged 65 years and over(14), with analysis restricted to those\nwho provided a full 4 d food diary. Of an eligible sample of\n2172 participants, 1275 (59%) free-living adults completed\na food diary. Additionally, 412 (91%) of participants in insti-\ntutions (nursing homes and residential homes for the elderly\nexcluding individuals in acute hospital beds) completed a\ndiet diary. Under-reporters were excluded with an energy\nintake:BMR ratio of ,1\u00b72(15), with BMR calculated using\nthe equation based on the mean weight for the elderly popu-\nlation group as 13\u00b75W \u00fe 487 in men and 10\u00b75W \u00fe 596 for\nwomen, where W is the average weight in kg(16). This meant\nthat 740 participants remained, of which 449 were men and\n291 were women. A further nineteen participants were\nexcluded from the analysis as their anthropometric data were\nnot recorded. The survey was conducted between October\n1994 and September 1995 in four stages, approximately\ncorresponding to the four seasons of the year(17).\nThe NDNS dataset was downloaded from the UK Data\nArchive, University of Essex. A master data file was created\nusing variables taken from different portable SPSS data files\nas provided by the principal investigators. Each food code\nfor a particular food group was summed together to give a\ntotal value for that food type. Participants were classified into\nquartiles based on their age, and net dietary acid load using\nestimated NEAP.\nDescriptions of the earlier and most recent calculation\nmodels for NEAP are described elsewhere(2,11,12). In the\npast, investigators have used different algorithms for estima-\nting the diet\u2019s daily net acid load, even when the estimates\nwere derived essentially from the same input variables, and\nthis had led to some terminological confusion. Because of\nthis, investigators in the field have recently agreed on\nstandardised terminology related to estimating the diet-\ndependent net acid load from the composition of the diet,\nbased on accepted physiological principles(10). Throughout\nthe present paper the term NEAP represents PRAL \u00fe OA\nor the protein:K algorithm where specified.\nEstimates of daily net acid load\nDietary acid is produced by the metabolism of the amino acids\ncysteine and methionine from protein to sulfuric acid. Dietary\nbases are the weak OA salts of Mg, K and Ca, such as potass-\nium citrate, which forms bicarbonate. The net balance between\nsulfate and phosphate, Mg, K and Ca represents the PRAL. In\naddition OA are excreted representing the incomplete meta-\nbolism of fats and carbohydrates and some minor dietary\nsources. Thus, overall net dietary acid production (NEAP)\nreflects the value of PRAL from acid- and base-forming com-\nponents ingested daily plus OA. For the body to remain in\nacid\u2013base balance, the net amount of acid excreted should\nbe equal to the net amount of acid produced.

There was a trend for vege-\ntable consumption to fall in men with increasing NEAP but\nthis was not significant. There was no clear or significant\ntrend for changes in legume consumption in men or women\nwith increasing NEAP. Higher intakes of meat and eggs sig-\nnificantly contributed to higher NEAP in men (P,0\u00b7001;\nP,0\u00b7001) and women (P,0\u00b7001; P,0\u00b702) respectively. For\nfish, higher intakes significantly contributed to higher NEAP\nin men (P,0\u00b701), and a similar but non-significant trend\nwas observed in women. Higher potato intakes in elderly\nmales and females were significantly associated with lower\nNEAP values (P,0\u00b701). Lower consumption of bread\nwas associated with lower NEAP in both elderly males\n(P,0\u00b7001) and females (P,0\u00b702) respectively. There was\nno clear or significant trend for changes in cereal consumption\nwith an increase in NEAP in men or women. Milk and yoghurt\nintakes varied widely with no significant trend according to\nNEAP intakes. Higher intakes of cheese in men were associ-\nated with increased NEAP values (P,0\u00b7001), and a marginal\nnon-significant increase was also observed in women There\nwas a significant association between increased consumption\nof biscuits and cakes and higher estimates of NEAP in\nwomen (P,0\u00b702). Increased consumption of desserts was sig-\nnificantly associated with higher NEAP values in women\n(P,0\u00b701). Higher intakes of preserves and jams were signifi-\ncantly associated with increased NEAP between quartiles 1\nand 3 and 2 and 3 (P,0\u00b702) in men, but there was no relation-\nship with NEAP values in women. Coffee consumption in\nwomen significantly fell with increasing NEAP (P,0\u00b701),\nbut there was no clear trend in men. Higher tea consumption\nwas significantly associated with lower NEAP values between\nthe latter two quartiles in elderly women (P,0\u00b7001). The\nopposite was seen in men, with higher intakes having a posi-\ntive impact on dietary acid load. Increased consumption of\nwater in men and women was associated with a reduction in\nNEAP. Consumption of savoury and sauces in women\nvaried widely, with a trend towards higher intakes being\nassociated with increased estimates of NEAP; however,\nthere was no clear trend in men.\nEstimates of dietary acidity according to geographical\nlocation\nFig. 1 represents the median dietary acid loadings for the\ndifferent UK regions. NEAP was highest in Scotland and\nNorthern England, respectively, and lowest for participants\nliving in London and South-Eastern England, with intermedi-\nate values in Central and South-Western England, with the\nNorth\u2013South differences significant (P\u00bc0\u00b701).\nCorrelation between estimates of net endogenous acid\nproduction using dietary potential renal acid load \u00fe organic\nacid and protein:potassium algorithm\nFig. 2 shows the correlation between PRAL \u00fe OA and pro-\ntein:K algorithm. There is a significant association between\nthe two algorithms which explained 54% of the variance\n(r 0\u00b772; P,0\u00b7001). However, at higher values of NEAP the\nrelationship is more variable. Thus within the top quartile of\nNEAP, variations in PRAL \u00fe OA explain only 18% of the\nvariation in protein:K algorithm compared with 38% in the\nbottom quartile.\nThe main reason for the deviation between the two esti-\nmates of NEAP is the OA term which closely reflects the\nfact that OA anion excretion is not primarily diet-dependent,\nbut based on the PRAL \u00fe OA model which is mainly deter-\nmined by body size(21).\nDiscussion\nThe principal objective of the present study was to investigate\nthe dietary acid burden in the UK elderly population from\nfood intakes as measured by a 4 d food diary and reported\nas the NDNS of British adults aged 65 years and over.\nA second objective was to compare and characterise NEAP\nby specific nutrients and food groups likely to influence diet-\nary acid loading; the third objective was to determine whether\ngeographical location influences estimates of NEAP. In the\npresent paper for the first time we demonstrate regional differ-\nences in NEAP, i.e. higher values in Northern regions com-\npared with Southern. NEAP was also lower in women\ncompared with men, and those eating more fruit and potatoes\nand less meat, fish, eggs, cheese and bread.\nA number of algorithms have been developed for estimating\nNEAP from food composition tables. However, it was felt that\nfor this present study the equation PRAL \u00fe OA was a more\nrobust method to determine the diet-dependent daily net acid\nload. One potential weakness of the algorithm NEAP is the\nassumption that OA production is a fixed function of body\nsize (endogenous OA \u00bc 41 \u00a3 BSA). In fact OA is difficult\nto measure completely and multiple methods for estimating\nOA excretion have been used(18). Furthermore, increasing\ndietary alkali load (for example, by increasing the intake of\nfruits and vegetables) has been reported to increase OA pro-\nduction to a greater extent than acid excretion(22). However,\nthe prediction equation has been demonstrated in children\nand 16\u201318-year-old adolescents, and in healthy adults con-\nsuming diets containing variable amounts of protein where\nmeasured OA excretion rates were very similar to the pre-\ndicted value(2,12). It is generally accepted that the influence\nof dietary acidity or alkalinity on NEAP is, in principle, addi-\ntive or subtractive to the amounts of acid equivalents derived\nfrom the (body size-dependent) metabolic system. Corre-\nspondingly, it appears predictable that both NEAP estimates\n(the sum estimate and the ratio estimate) deviate more notice-\nably from each other when changes in dietary acid load\nNet endogenous acid production in the elderly 619\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nTable 6.

However, whatever estimate is\nused, true NEAP can only be determined in a metabolic setting\nwhere urinary losses of OA and faecal losses of organic anions\ncan be measured(23).\nThe assumption inherent in the present calculations is that\nurinary acid excretion balances the dietary and endogenous\nacid load so that the organism is in neutral acid\u2013base balance.\nHowever, at high dietary acid loads this may not be the case,\nsince previous studies have shown that with values greater\nthan an average acid intake of approximately 1mEq\/kg body\nweight, net acid production is greater than net acid excretion,\nleading to positive acid balance(24). Average calculated values\nfor NEAP in the present studies were below this value,\nalthough a positive acid balance may have occurred in sub-\njects at the upper end of the overall range of NEAP values.\nThe median value for NEAP in this present study was 47\u00b79\n(IQR 10\u00b77) mEq\/d and is slightly lower than in a recent\nstudy of measured urinary acid excretion in a population of\n400 elderly subjects (aged 55\u201375 years) with a mean of\n60\u00b70 (SD 27\u00b70)mEq\/d(25), a value similar to previous reported\nmeasurements(12). Since this was a more northerly (Swedish)\npopulation of elderly, it may be that the higher acidity\nreflected the same differences in dietary patterns which\naccount for our finding of the higher acid diets for Scotland\nand Northern England compared with London and Southern-\nEastern England (P\u00bc0\u00b701). A similar finding was found by\nFrassetto et al. where they showed that Sweden had the\nlowest intake of vegetable to animal protein(26). It is the\ncase that a lower intake of fruit and vegetables and a higher\nconsumption of beef and veal (and dishes made from them)\nfor Scotland and Northern England compared with the South\nhave been reported. Moreover, participants in London and\nthe South East were more likely to consume leafy green vege-\ntables, semi-skimmed milk and coffee than in Scotland and\nNorthern England(14). However, the values here are also some-\nwhat lower than those reported for Cambridge teenagers by\nPrynne et al. (67\u00b78mEq\/d for boys v. 53\u00b78mEq\/d for girls),\nalthough different dietary patterns are likely between teen-\nagers and the elderly(27). Interestingly, Lemann has estimated\nthat the average diet consumed by American healthy adults\ngenerates approximately 50mEq\/d, a value very similar to\nour findings(28). Another plausible reason for the lower\nvalues is that the basic mineral Ca has not been excluded\nfrom the NEAP equation (see original equation)(2). Removing\nCa from the formula would result in a somewhat higher NEAP\nvalue (59\u00b73 (IQR 9\u00b78) mEq\/d) in this population group(13).\nOne potential problem in interpreting the original dataset is\nunder-reporting. This is a major problem with the use\nof self-reporting dietary diaries, where under-reporting of\ntrue habitual food intake, as well as changing the diet during\nthe survey, is a frequent problem(29). Thus initial energy\nintakes (including all participants who completed a 4 d\ndiary) were on average 1\u00b724 (SD 0\u00b732) \u00a3 estimated BMR\n(7878 (SD 1958) kJ (1883 (SD 468) kcal) for men and 6109\n(SD 1523) kJ (1460 (SD 364) kcal) for women respectively).\nThis implies extensive under-reporting, and in fact 24%\nof the overall sample size had energy intakes ,1 \u00a3 BMR\n(19% for men, 28% for women). Here we selected subjects\non the basis of an energy intake:BMR ratio $1\u00b72, resulting\nin mean energy intakes for the sub-sample of 1\u00b747 (SD 0\u00b723) \u00a3\nestimated BMR (8958 (SD 1565) kJ (2141 (SD 374) kcal)\nfor men and 7305 (SD 1138) kJ (1746 (SD 272) kcal) for\nwomen respectively)(15,29). In fact there was very little\ndifference between NEAP for the complete sample compared\nwith the trimmed sub-sample (47\u00b71 (IQR 10\u00b74) v. 47\u00b79 (IQR\n10\u00b77) mEq\/d).\nThe relationships between NEAP and macro- and micronu-\ntrients were to some extent but not entirely expected, demon-\nstrating the importance of examining how these nutrients\nimpact on dietary acid loading. Thus increasing NEAP was\nassociated with increasing protein and P (P,0\u00b7001) in elderly\nmen and women, but somewhat surprisingly not with a signifi-\ncant fall in K (in women), Mg or Ca, the latter actually\nsignificantly increasing in men. The increasing NEAP with\nincreasing energy intakes is also likely to reflect the\npositive correlations between energy intakes and the other\nconstituents listed in Table 5. Also the OA component of\nthe algorithm, which is a major contributor to overall acidity,\nFig. 1. Differences in median net endogenous acid production (NEAP)\naccording to geographical location. NEAP \u00bc potential renal acid load (PRAL)\n(mEq\/d) \u00fe estimated urinary organic anions (OA) (mEq\/d)(2,10). ANOVA and\nTukey post hoc tests were used for the analysis. * Median value was signifi-\ncantly different from that for London and the South-East (P\u00bc0\u00b701).\nFig. 2. Spearman\u2019s correlation of association (r 0\u00b772; P,0\u00b701) using potential\nrenal acid load \u00fe estimated urinary organic anions (PRAL \u00fe OA) and\nprotein:K algorithm as estimates of net endogenous acid production.\nNet endogenous acid production in the elderly 621\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nis predicted from body size and in this dataset varies positively\nwith energy intake, albeit to a much lesser extent than\nprotein or P. Of most interest as far as the single nutrients\nare concerned is the clear inverse relationship between\nNEAP and vitamin C in men and women (P,0\u00b701) and this\nhas obvious implications in relation to the food group\u2013\nNEAP relationships discussed below.\nFor food groups their expected relationships between\nincreasing acidity was clear for intakes of the major dietary\nprotein sources in terms of meat, fish, and eggs in both\nmen and women. Conversely, higher intakes of potatoes\nhad a significantly positive impact on dietary alkalinity in\nmen and women (P,0\u00b701), as potatoes were one of the lar-\ngest individual consumed food item and have a rich K con-\ntent. The importance of the association of fruit, which have\na clear association with K, with lower dietary acidity is\nemphasised here, as previously reported by others(13,27,30,31).\nThe combination of fruit and potatoes as alkalising com-\nponents of the diet no doubt explains the clear relationship\nbetween vitamin C and a lower dietary acidity. For vege-\ntables, however, intakes were independent of acidity; this\nmay be due to the food grouping, as once the protein-rich\nvegetables (lentils, dried beans and pulses) were removed\nfrom the analysis the difference was almost significant\n(P\u00bc0\u00b706) between higher intakes and lower dietary acid\nload. Legumes are an important source of P with a high\nP:Ca ratio so that when this is taken into account as in the\nNEAP algorithm their overall contribution to dietary acidity\nwould be expected to become more neutral. Food combi-\nnation is also a very important aspect of acid\u2013base balance\nas vegetables including potatoes which are alkali generating\ntend to be eaten with meat, fish and eggs which increase die-\ntary acidity. This is particularly the case of the eating pat-\nterns of the elderly population.\nIn the context of diet and bone health median Ca intakes\nwere slightly above the UK reference nutrient intake of\n700mg\/d but the wide variation meant that considerable num-\nbers had intakes below this. However, attempting to interpret\nthe inter-relationships between intakes of Ca, phosphate, milk\/\nyoghurt and cheese and acidity is complicated by the sex\ndifferences in the results. Such inter-relationships are no\ndoubt influenced by food patterns in terms of the association\nbetween food types. However, a more detailed analysis of\nthe individual food items milk, yoghurt and dairy desserts\ndid not account for the sex differences as described above.\nThus for women dietary acidity appears independent of\nintakes of Ca, milk, yoghurt and cheese. This is in contrast\nto the report for UK teenage girls and boys(27). For men, how-\never, while milk intakes were not associated with acidity,\nincreasing Ca and cheese intakes were. Interestingly, higher\nintakes of bread, biscuits and cakes were significantly associ-\nated with increases in dietary acidity in women, whereas for\nmen this was only the case for bread.\nThe two algorithms for NEAP were highly correlated, as\nobserved by Prynne et al.(27). However, when compared in the\nsame participants they resulted in very slight but significantly\ndifferent (0\u00b78mEq\/d) average values for all subjects. This con-\nfirms that the protein:K algorithm, based on just protein and\nK, does accurately demonstrate that in this dataset men\u2019s\ndiets are more acid than women\u2019s through a relatively higher\nconsumption of protein compared with K-containing foods.\nThere is increasing evidence to support the negative effects\nof imbalances in acid\u2013base homeostasis and bone loss,\nskeletal muscle atrophy and nephrolithiasis in the\nageing population(4,9,10). Interestingly, Wachman & Bernstein\nhypothesised almost 40 years ago that consuming a typical\nWestern diet may result in the lifelong utilisation of the\nbuffer salts found in bone leading to bone fragility and osteo-\nporosis(5). Furthermore, Frassetto et al.(32) have shown that\nplasma bicarbonate concentration and glomerular filtration\nrate with increasing age causes these parameters to fall\nwhereas blood hydrogen ion concentrations increase with\nage. This in turn leads to an increasingly worsening low-\ngrade metabolic acidosis and is reflective of increases in die-\ntary acidity. If the acid\u2013base\/skeleton theory is to be\nbelieved(7,33) the finding of the present study has important\nimplications regarding advocating dietary acid\u2013base advice\nin the ageing population, particularly in elderly women. This\ncould include programmes to increase fruit and vegetable con-\nsumption in those participants with the highest estimates of\nNEAP, because the NDNS of British adults aged 65 years\nand over has also shown that levels of both these foods are\nonly consumed in modest amounts. Prudence needs to be exer-\ncised in participants with low estimates of NEAP, as such\ndiets are generally lacking in protein such as meats, fish and\nmilk and this may be a concern for bone health.\nA limitation of the present study is the lack of information\nwithin the database on disease states likely to be influenced by\nacid\u2013base balance such as bone health. Without such data, the\ndegree to which higher net dietary acid intake is a significant\nfactor in health problems in older population groups will\nremain poorly understood. Future studies should address this\nquestion. It would also be interesting to look at the effects\nof both food preparation and wholegrain v. refined grains on\nNEAP and is certainly an area of future research. Future\nwork to confirm the prediction value for OA from surface\narea in population groups is needed where shape, overall\nsize and body composition are changing as with the age-\nrelated changes in the current population.\nIn summary, these analyses provide an insight into the acid-\ngenerating potential of the diet of the UK elderly population,\nshowing the diet to be rich in dietary acid precursors, higher in\nmen than women, increasing with age and higher in a more\nNortherly location. Such trends may also be found in other\nindustrialised countries with similar diets and, in turn, may\nhave important consequences in this vulnerable group.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to formally acknowledge and thank the\nBritish Journal of Nutrition review process for considerably\nstrengthening our manuscript.
