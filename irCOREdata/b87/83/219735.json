This paper articulates and defends the essential role of partisanship in this \nprocess. Four dimensions of justification are examined in detail: the constituency to which political \njustifications are offered, the circumstances in which they are developed, the ways they are made \ninclusive, and the ways they are made persuasive.  In each case, the role of partisanship is probed and \naffirmed.  Partisanship, we conclude, is indispensable to the kind of political justification needed to make \nthe exercise of collective authority responsive to normative concerns.1 \n \n \n \n \nIn democratic societies, a minimal condition of political power being considered \nlegitimate is that it be exercised in a non-arbitrary fashion.  Such is the basis of any \ndistinction between collective authority and brute force.  Political justification is an \nimportant part of the process by which this distinction is maintained.  As a normative \nideal, political justification is linked to a model of discursive exchange by which citizens \njointly frame the terms of life in common and aspire to do so on the basis of reasons \nwidely shared.  It is the means by which decision-making acquires an identifiable \nrationale, one which can be scrutinised and evaluated by those whom decisions will \naffect.  As a practice, justification is attempted each time political agents confront one \nanother in the public sphere and put forward arguments supportive of a given course of \naction, or explicative of why it should be modified or rejected.  Our question in the \nfollowing is how best to characterise the kinds of citizen activity conducive to political \njustification.  From what channels can it be expected to flow? \nThe question has already received attention from democratic theorists linking it \nto deliberative accounts of the public sphere, a sphere where \u2013 at least in its ideal form \u2013 \npolitical justification is guided by rules of interaction considered potentially universal, \nopen and inclusive.  Authors have emphasized the relevance for justification of various \ndemocratic fora \u2013 deliberative polls, citizen juries, discursive chambers, and mini-\npublics \u2013 where citizens critically assess issues of common concern (Chambers 2003) \n(Thompson 2008).  Here we shall take a different path, examining the contribution to \npolitical justification of a different mode of civic engagement, one widely familiar from \n                                                          \n1  Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the 2009 ECPR General Conference in Potsdam and the \nNuffield Political Theory Workshop.  The authors gratefully acknowledge the feedback given on both \noccasions, and especially thank Matteo Bonotti, Dimitris Efthimiou, Bob Goodin, Patti Lenard, David Miller \nand Alan Ware.  Excellent comments were also received from four referees and the journal\u2019s editors.  \nJonathan White received valuable research funding from the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung. \n2 \n \nday-to-day politics yet often the target of scepticism and distrust.  This mode of \nengagement is partisanship, a largely overlooked one amongst contemporary political \ntheorists.2  The article examines the crucial contribution of partisanship to the process \nof reason-giving that underpins political justification in a democratic polity.   \nDespite the growing interest shown by deliberative democrats in identifying \nempirical sites of public justification, partisanship as a form of civic practice has largely \nbeen neglected (van Biezen and Saward 2008, esp. pp. 24-25; Johnson 2006, pp. 48-49).  \nThe persistence of principled disagreement has been emphasised by many in recent \nyears (Gutmann and Thompson 1996) (Mansbridge 2006) (Dryzek 2000), such that \nRawlsian and Habermasian notions of reasoned public consensus can no longer be \nconsidered predominant.  Yet qualified acceptance of the relevance of political \nadversarialism for political justification has rarely led to candid appreciation of one of \nits paradigmatic forms.3  Partisanship is typically associated with negotiating and \nbargaining from a self-interested perspective, recognised at best as a concession to \npolitical realism, and often contrasted with public-spirited efforts at political \njustification.  Our argument is more positive: that the ideals of justification which \ndeliberative democrats rightly adhere to are inescapably bound up in the partisan \nattitude.  Political justification, both in its guise as normative ideal and as a real-world \npractice, contains an irreducible element of partisanship, and those granting the value \nof the former should acknowledge that much depends on the vitality of the latter.  While \ndeliberative fora of the kind mentioned are very plausible sites of justification, a \ncomplete account must give due prominence to the place of partisanship. \nThe argument proceeds as follows.  We begin by showing how partisanship, \nproperly conceived, is far less remote from deliberative ideas of justification than it first \nappears.  While empirical scholars of the political party sometimes lose sight of the fact, \ncommon ground exists as regards the non-particularist constituency to which both \nmodes of action make appeal.  Partisanship, unlike factionalism, involves efforts to \n                                                          \n2 Important exceptions are Muirhead 2010, 2006; Rosenblum 2008; Goodin 2008; see also White and Ypi \n2010. These authors have all emphasized the democratic relevance of partisanship, but its specific \ncontribution to political justification remains to be explored.  \n3 As van Biezen and Saward emphasize, \u201cthe more recent theories of deliberative democracy, while not \nnecessarily unsympathetic to the notion of representation, define few, if any, of the linkages between \n\u201crepresentatives\u201d and \u201cconstituents\u201d in terms of party, with parties typically regarded as belonging to the \nwrong side of the aggregation-deliberation dichotomy\u201d. See also Johnson 1996, p.48.  One of the few texts \nto explore the positive relationship between partisanship and deliberation (Hendriks et al. 2007) \nconceives the former as the inclusion of \u2018relevant stakeholders\u2019: as we shall argue, this ascription of \nsectoral intent problematically conflates partisanship with factionalism, and thus severely circumscribes \nwhat the former can be seen as contributing to political justification.  A similarly narrow view of \npartisanship is to be found in a recent landmark article by Mansbridge and other prominent deliberative \ntheorists (Mansbridge et al. 2010, p. 93). \n3 \n \nharness political power not for the benefit of one social group amongst several but for \nthat of the association as a whole, as this benefit is identified through a particular \ninterpretation of the common good.   \nHaving established the fundamental compatibility of partisanship and political \njustification, we go on to chart their interdependence.  First we focus on what we call \nthe circumstances of political justification.  We illustrate how these are characterised by \nthree important features: a comparative perspective, an adversarial posture, and a basic \nlevel of public visibility.  We go on to explore how partisanship, understood in ideal-\ntypical terms as what partisans achieve at their best, is intrinsically related to each of \nthese dimensions, thus acting as a key ingredient in the process of political justification.   \nThe next section develops these points further by considering an important \ncritique to the ideal of political justification in circumstances so conceived: that it is \nfatally undermined by real-world conditions of profoundly unequal access to \ndeliberative resources (e.g. inequalities of education and power) which render it \ninaccessible to all but an elite few.  Our argument complements existing deliberative \nefforts to counter this objection by emphasizing what partisanship has to offer to \ncitizens in adverse circumstances.  Specifically, we argue it may act as a vehicle of \nintellectual and political empowerment, refining citizens\u2019 views, lending them voice, and \nraising their critical awareness vis-\u00e0-vis the justificatory discourses embedded in \nunquestioned, commonsense assumptions.  \nHaving looked at partisanship\u2019s role first in sparking justification and then in \nmaking it widely accessible, in the fourth section we examine its role in rendering \njustification persuasive.  We explore the elements of which political justification is \ncomposed, expanding our discussion to include a dimension often neglected \u2013 the tacit \nunderstandings with which justification must resonate if it is to be favourably received. \nWe discuss the contribution of partisan practices to the emergence of justificatory \narguments, the elaboration of their premises, and the critique or development of the \nbackground views informing their assessment.  By considering how partisanship shapes \nthese schemes of understanding and evaluation, we highlight their influence in framing \npolitical judgment and their essential role in the normative assessment of proposed \ncourses of action.  \nFinally, we ask whether the account of partisan political justification we have \nprovided retains space for a progressive model of public life, one able to come to terms \nwith the pathologies of \u2018actually existing partisanship\u2019 and whose persistent pluralism \nneed not entail a politics of incomprehension and relativism.  We examine two \n4 \n \nimportant objections to our argument: that it neglects the real-world failures of \ncontemporary partisans, and that it overlooks how partisanship undermines the very \npurpose of political justification \u2013 the achievement of agreement on the principles \norienting collective decision-making.  Recognizing these difficulties, we nonetheless \nshow that neither is fatal to the argument.  Rather than undermining a defence of \npartisan political justification, they give reminder of why the partisan mode of \nengagement is one to be endorsed and fostered. \nBefore proceeding, a note on our terminology.  We have chosen to use the term \n\u2018partisanship\u2019, which, in contrast to \u2018party\u2019, points to a practice rather than a particular \norganisational form.  It is a practice which involves citizens acting to promote certain \nshared normative commitments according to a distinctive interpretation of the public \ngood.  Their goal is to make their concerns heard in the public sphere so that they may \nbe brought to bear on the course of collective decision-making.  Partisans differ from \nthose who wish to influence governmental policies without giving explicit support to a \nparticular party, such as many (though not all) social-movement activists, independent \nintellectuals or scientific experts.  Partisans are interested in who holds public office and \nin the name of what principles, and they seek to advance one or a number of sides in \ncompetition with others.  At the core of their efforts is a political party, understood as \nthe organisation within which these practices find a peculiarly dense and coordinated \nform.  Yet partisanship as a practice does not always follow closely the contours of party \nmembership: it will extend beyond the face-to-face contacts of membership to a broader \nnetwork of political activists seeking to advance largely the same goals, even in the \nabsence of formal attachments.   \nPerhaps there is nothing so unfamiliar in this approach: indeed, this is how \nparties used to be conceptualised when they first emerged in the modern world (Ball \n1989) (Gunn 1971). Edmund Burke evoked an explicitly relational conception when \nspeaking of parties and factions as \u2018political connections\u2019, and put emphasis on \ncoordinated action in support of shared goals when giving his classic definition of the \nparty as \u2018a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national \ninterest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed\u2019 (Burke 1770, \np.271).  Something similar can be found in Hume\u2019s distinction between parties \u2018from \ninterest\u2019, \u2018from principle\u2019 and \u2018from affection\u2019 (Hume [1748] 1998), a typology in which \nmotivation rather than form is placed to the fore.  Or think of Gramsci\u2019s understanding of \nthe party as a \u2018modern prince\u2019, \u2018the first cell in which come together the germs of a \ncollective will tending to become universal and total\u2019 (Gramsci 1971, p. 129).  The \n5 \n \norganisation is but the expression of a wider unity of purpose.  It is true that modern \nusage of the term \u2018party\u2019 has tended to direct attention to its organisational aspects \u2013 to \nthe ways these shared efforts and orientations come to be institutionalised \u2013 and has \ntended to construe partisanship as stable support for a given organisation.  Partisans are \nregarded as marked by their fidelity to a certain collective rather than an independent \nbody of political views (e.g. Campbell et al. 1960).  But there seems worth to be had in \nthe broader meaning, and with the term \u2018partisanship\u2019 we may advance a conception \nmore akin to these earlier accounts.4 \n \n \nTHE CONSTITUENCY OF POLITICAL JUSTIFICATION \n \nRather than as mutually supporting elements of a democratic regime, some may see a \ntension between political justification and partisanship.  Let us begin by exploring this \ntension, for we need to soften it before a more positive argument can emerge.  One way \nto sketch it, and then to reduce it, is by considering the question of to whom political \njustification is given.  Justifications, political or otherwise, imply an addressee (Simmons \n1999, p. 759) (Chambers 2010, p. 893).  To justify is always to justify to, whether to an \nindividual or a group, and whether the receiver be sympathetic and cognisant of the act \nor not.  In the political context, one can refer to this addressee as the constituency.5 \n Perhaps one\u2019s initial inclination will be to regard the constituency for justification \nin a partisanship-based model of politics as quite different from that in a deliberative \none.  Justification in a deliberative conception is directed at the political body in its \nentirety.  While deliberative theorists have recently acknowledged there may be \nempirical reasons why acts of justification come to be rejected by some, it is axiomatic \nthat justification involves the provision of reasons accessible to all citizens (Cohen 1996, \npp. 99-100) (Habermas 1996, pp. 463-90) (Bohman 1998, pp. 401-403). In contrast, in \n                                                          \n4 As one example of the limitations of an organisation-centred conception, consider those cases where a \nparty\u2019s programmatic orientation is shifted quite fundamentally by its leaders, prompting criticism from \nits wider circle of activists and supporters (something experienced by a number of Europe\u2019s social-\ndemocratic parties in the 1990s and 2000s following the adoption of Third-Way ideas).  When a given \nparty departs from the principles for which individuals once endorsed it, genuine partisanship might \nplausibly be understood not as continued support but as the withdrawal of support, whether as a \ntemporary protest or even so as to form a new party.   \n5 Note that, in this reading, constituencies are not understood in the purely electoral sense as the circle of \nregistered voters in a given territorial unit, nor as a social group constituted by clearly defined interests: \nthey are regarded as evoked politically rather than pre-defined legally or materially.  A discussion of \ndifferent conceptions of constituency can be found in (Rehfeld 2005) chapter 2, but the conceptions he \nfocuses on treat constituencies as self-standing entities to which political actors (e.g. parties) make \nappeal.  By contrast, we treat them as entities evoked, more or less successfully, by partisans as they seek \nto mobilise support.  They are categories of political discourse first and of social reality second. \n6 \n \nparty scholarship as well as everyday usage, justification as it emerges from the mouths \nof partisans is often seen as aimed at units much smaller than the community as a whole.  \nThe constituency tends to be regarded as a sub-grouping, defined by reference to a \ngroup identity, a distinctive set of pre-political values, or an aggregation of interests.  \nOne will be familiar for example with the notion that the US Republican party \nsuccessfully strengthened its position in the 2004 Presidential election by increasing its \nshare of the \u2018Latino vote\u2019 with carefully-crafted appeals designed to resonate with this \ndemographic: regardless of its empirical truth, such a thesis neatly expresses the idea \nthat partisans address their justificatory efforts to parts of the population, ignoring \nwhere necessary the diverging concerns of others.  Perspectives such as cleavage theory \n(Lipset and Rokkan 1967) or interest-group pluralism (Dahl 1961) likewise evoke \npartisans as speaking not to the bulk of citizens taken as one large constituency, offering \nto them an interpretation of the good of all, but as addressing sub-units of the \npopulation, whether it be socio-cultural groupings (religious or ethnic groups) or \ninterest-based groupings (classes, professional associations, etc.).  Equally partial is the \nconstituency for justification sometimes referred to as the \u2018median voter\u2019, whose \npreferences parties attempt to represent with diminished regard for those at the \npolitical \u2018extremes\u2019 (Downs 1957).  Still more remote from a deliberative conception is \nof course the Schumpeterian account of partisanship, in which rationalist ideas of \njustification and representation barely play a role, being substituted instead for a focus \non party-branding, advertising and the appeal to emotions (Schumpeter 1942).  \n Deliberative theorists rightly criticise such preference-aggregative approaches \nfor their rather thin notion of the public good (Sunstein 1991) (Cohen 1989) \n(Mansbridge et al. 2010).  At best, it comes to be regarded as what naturally emerges \nfrom partisan clashes \u2013 a bargain struck between the positions they represent.  It is not \nsomething to which partisans themselves can reasonably appeal, since the interests, \nidentities and preferences to which they orient themselves are necessarily but fractions \nof the whole.  Analogously to the libertarian conception of the market, if the public good \nis served at all then it is by an invisible hand, for the actions of each protagonist are \ninspired rather by private goals.  If the partisan model necessarily entailed this \nconception of justification, scepticism would be in order, for it seems the kind of \nrationale invoked precisely to cope with the absence of political justification in day-to-\nday politics. \n Yet the idea that partisan justification need aim at something less than the whole \nis unfounded.  Indeed, it overlooks a historically important distinction between \n7 \n \npartisanship and factionalism, as developed by classical theorists such as Burke and as is \ncrucial to their definitions of the party.  For it is the faction which addresses a partial \nconstituency and exhibits no concern to justify its programme to the community in toto; \na party by contrast is that political grouping which justifies its proposals in the name of \nthe whole.  As one prominent scholar put it, \u2018If a party is not a part capable of governing \nfor the sake of the whole, that is, in view of a general interest, then it does not differ from \na faction.  Although a party only represents a part, this part must take a non-partial \napproach to the whole\u2019 (Sartori 1968\/1990, p. 26) (cf. Muirhead & Rosenblum 2006).  A \npolitical grouping which, for example, seeks to promote only agrarian interests, though \nit may call itself a \u2018farmers\u2019 party\u2019, is more properly seen as a faction \u2013 unless it \nintegrates these interests into a wider normative vision addressed to the good of the \npolitical community at large.  Note that the distinction refers to aims rather than to the \nsuccess with which these are met: at stake is not whether, in the eyes of the observer, a \npolitical grouping reliably does serve the public good (this will be a matter for political \ndebate), but whether it seeks to do so given the kinds of argumentation it pursues. \n The distinction between party and faction was crucial to enabling \u2018party\u2019 to \nemerge as an accepted feature of modern democracy (Ball 1989), yet in the \ncontemporary world it can easily provoke scepticism.  Some may wonder whether it is \nnot entirely subjective: whether one person\u2019s party is just another person\u2019s faction, with \nthere being little empirical basis on which to adjudicate.  Others will argue that \ncontemporary linguistic usage no longer permits the distinction: that we have become \nso accustomed to referring to all political groupings as \u2018parties\u2019 that it would be perverse \nto withdraw the label from all but a select few \u2013 that the distinction can be regarded as \nantiquated.  Then there may be those who grant that the distinction can be \noperationalised, but argue one should not make too much of it: parties, it may be said, \ntend quickly to degenerate into factions (this was Bolingbroke\u2019s view), and so there is \nlittle sense in attaching normative meaning to the distinction.   \n The first of these concerns has truth to it, in that many applications of the \ndistinction may be contestable.  They need not be seen as arbitrary however.  Note that \nthe party-faction distinction does not require one to have perfect knowledge of the \nbeliefs and intentions of those involved: much may be established by looking at their \nprincipled statements and the way the addressee is evoked.  If a grouping presents itself \nas speaking for the good of the whole, one need not dwell on the sincerity of individual \nmotivations; rather one can acknowledge this as the public face which the grouping \n8 \n \npresents and the terms on which citizens encounter it.6  The second concern \u2013 that the \ndistinction is antiquated \u2013 is not especially forceful either, since it can be revitalised in \nnew terminology where necessary, e.g. by distinguishing faction-parties from \u2018great \nparties\u2019 (Muirhead and Rosenblum 2006).7  The third concern, that what we call parties \ntend to decay into factions, and that the distinction is therefore utopian, is an important \nempirical contention and we shall return to it in the final part of the article.  However, it \nis worth noting here that countervailing empirical trends can also be discerned. The \nthesis described seems at odds with that large body of twentieth-century empirical \nresearch which reports the rise of \u2018catch-all parties\u2019 (Kirchheimer 1966).  These are \nunderstood precisely as political groupings which seek to draw support from as many \ncitizens as possible and which do not restrict themselves to a narrow constituency \ncentred on pre-defined social units.  Many observers, it is true, look dimly on these \nparties (the \u2018catch-all\u2019 moniker being intended as derogatory), for they suppose these \nefforts to broaden appeal are coupled with a dilution of normative commitments: that \nsuch groupings seek to be \u2018all things to all people\u2019, and consequently lose their \nprogrammatic distinctiveness and ability to engage. But these are secondary points, \nrooted in contestable beliefs about the kinds of political strategy needed to mobilise \nsupporters rather than an appraisal of the constituency being addressed.8  The point to \nnote here is that there is little empirical reason to suppose that \u2018parties\u2019, as those \ngroupings seeking the widest of constituencies, are necessarily transient or uncommon.   \n An understanding of partisanship as oriented to the wider public returns to the \nforeground practices of justification of the kind one would find in a deliberative model.  \nIn this reading political justification regains a substantial degree of autonomy from the \nsocial world, and may take on a transformative character, evoking new groupings rather \nthan appealing to pre-political ones.  The explicitly political categories of Left and Right, \nwhich draw their meaning from opposed political principles rather than social \n                                                          \n6 On the likelihood of compound motivations that mix altruism with self-interest, and on their consistency \nwith the party idea, see Sartori 1976, p.22.  Note also recent moves to incorporate self-interest into the \ncatalogue of motivations consistent with deliberative ideals (Mansbridge et al., 2010). \n7 A distinction between \u2018great\u2019 and \u2018small\u2019 parties \u2013 the latter sounding very much like factions \u2013 can be \nfound in (Tocqueville pp.203ff.). \n8 Such arguments derive from lingering attachment to the aggregative conception described above, \nwhereby the appeal to sectoral interest is seen as the only reliable means by which parties can engage \nwith civil society.  The role of political principles in constituting interests and conceptions of justice, and \ndeveloping the attachments which follow from these, is systematically under-weighted in such accounts.  \nFor a discussion of Kirchheimer\u2019s thesis which contests his equation of elite-oriented organisation and \ncatch-all aspiration with a weakening of programmatic commitments, see Diamond and Gunther 2003, \np.191.  As the authors note, parties such as the British Conservatives under Thatcher, the US Republicans \nunder Reagan and George W Bush, the Czech Social Democrats (CSSD) and Communists (KSCM), and \nFidesz in Hungary, have all combined wide popularity with a sharply defined vision, thereby constituting \nan enduring species of \u2018programmatic party\u2019 (p.187).   \n9 \n \ngroupings exogenous to the political process, are a familiar and paradigmatic rendition \nof this idea (Dyrberg 2005) (White 2011a, forthcoming).  To be sure, narrower forms of \nsubjecthood may support such categories, helping to mobilise people to a certain set of \nnormative goals (White and Ypi, 2010).  But those goals are partisan rather than \nfactional only to the extent they are proposed in the name of the public good.9  A \nworkers\u2019 party, for instance, is only truly a party insofar as it makes the claim that a \nredistribution of wealth on behalf of workers serves a wider sense of justice and the \npublic interest, and not just the sectarian good of workers themselves.  This point comes \nthrough clearly in Marx\u2019s definition of proletarian claims as those coming from \u201ca sphere \nwhich has a universal character by its universal suffering and claims no particular right \nbecause no particular wrong, but wrong generally, is perpetuated against it; which can \ninvoke no historical, but only human, title\u201d.10  Partisan commitments are in this case \nexpressive of universal concerns, and the interests of one particular category of agent \nare taken seriously insofar as the claims they make can be shared by others. \nWhy then is partisanship so often seen as narrower in its intended constituency \nand hence anathema to political justification?  Probably in large part this results from \nthe tendency of partisans themselves to portray opposing partisans as sectarian factions, \nas \u2018parties of\u2019 a particular grouping (e.g. of business, or of the public-sector middle class) \nrather than as \u2018parties for\u2019 a certain normative view.11  This is, after all, an easy way to \nimply a competing interpretation of the public good is undesirable (Rosenblum 2008, p. \n358).  In some cases the charge may be accurate \u2013 modern democracies certainly contain \nsuch factions \u2013 but its usage may also be no more than a strategy of de-legitimisation.12 \n                                                          \n9 It may be objected that this conception of partisanship does not apply in so-called \u2018divided societies\u2019, \nwhere political groupings seek only to appeal to an (often ethnically defined) sub-community, resulting in \na form of consociational politics of the kind described by Lijphart.  However, this seems tautological \nreasoning: divided societies exactly are those in which partisanship as described is, at a given moment, \nlacking.  Unless one sees politics as determined by pre-political social facts, one need not suppose that a \ndivided society must always be such, that political claims must inevitably be addressed to just some \nsections of the political community; it is rather a contingent and temporally-limited condition.   \n10 This, Marx continues, is \u201ca sphere, finally, which cannot emancipate itself without emancipating itself \nfrom all other spheres of society and thereby emancipating all other spheres of society, which, in a word \n[...] can win itself only through the complete re-winning of the human being\u201d (Marx 1843 \/ 1994, p.69).  \n11 Bolingbroke was perhaps an early proponent of this tactic, casting opponents as seeking \u2018personal \npower\u2019 and the narrow interest of the Court, \u2018under the pretence and umbrage of principle\u2019 (p.71), while \nspeaking favourably of the \u2018Country party\u2019, \u2018authorised by the voice of the country\u2019 and \u2018formed on \nprinciples of common interests.  It cannot be united and maintained on the particular prejudices, any \nmore than it can, or ought to be, directed to the particular interests of any set of men whatsoever.  A \nparty, thus constituted, is improperly called party.  It is the nation, speaking and acting in the discourse \nand conduct of particular men.\u2019 (Bolingbroke 1733 \/ 1997, p.37).  \n12 An example may be found in British public discourse in the build-up to the 2010 General Election: those \nin the Labour Party hoping to shift the party leftwards with a programme of higher taxation on the \nwealthy were soon characterised by their political opponents and their partisan sympathisers in the \nmedia as seeking to pursue a \u2018core vote strategy\u2019, i.e. wilfully sacrificing the wider public constituency so \nas to shore up their appeal to a narrower circle of working-class voters. What might otherwise have been \n10 \n \nThe effects may be unwelcome \u2013 presenting dissenting views as disingenuous can have a \ncorrosive impact on public debate \u2013 but again this is a separate matter.  Important is that \none does not mistake certain aspects of partisan rhetoric for an accurate representation \nof the nature of partisanship. \n Partisan justification need not be contrasted to deliberative justification, \ncertainly not as concerns the constituency to which justification is offered.  In both \naccounts, justification may be designed so as to be accessible to all reasonable citizens \u2013 \nsomething necessary to recognise if one is not to dismiss prematurely the relevance of \npartisanship to political justification.  Both perspectives are consistent with the idea that \nthere is a generalising tendency to justification: that it involves an attempt to move \nbeyond a particularist viewpoint with the aim of demonstrating how a certain claim has \npublic appeal.  Of course, a partisan model of politics is not an image of a politics without \nadversaries: partisanship is pursued exactly in the knowledge that others interpret the \npublic interest differently, or wish to make public authority serve factional ends.  Some \nsuch opponents may be cajoled out of their views, others will persist in their opposition.  \nYet if political conflict is assumed to be enduring, the partisan nonetheless addresses a \nconstituency which is not a priori defined as narrow and limited in scope. \n \nThe remainder of this article looks more closely at the positive relationship \nbetween partisanship and political justification.  It examines the circumstances in which \npolitical justification takes place, before looking at the relevance of partisanship to \nrendering justification inclusive and to shaping the positive body of moral and political \nintuitions in which it is grounded.   \n \n \nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF POLITICAL JUSTIFICATION, AND THE PARTISAN \nCATALYST \n \nWe shall begin by examining certain features of political justification as it may be \nexpected to arise in the benign circumstances of a well-functioning democracy.  Our \nsuggestion is that already here, in a political environment unblemished by major \nproblems of citizen disengagement and entrenched inequality, partisanship makes an \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \nread as an intervention in a public-oriented debate about fairness and equality was thereby reduced to a \nfactional move designed to place the part before the whole.  Such an interpretation does not of course \nrequire us to reject the strategic dimension: the point is that there was no necessary reason to cast it as \ndominant. \n11 \n \nimportant contribution to political justification.  The argument will then be developed \nwith regard to those real-world scenarios where the challenges to democratic \ngovernment are deep-seated, and where the necessity of partisanship is correspondingly \ngreater.  \nThe first thing to note about justification is that it is inherently comparative.  To \njustify something is to indicate how it compares favourably with alternatives, all \nrelevant factors considered.  To justify a political principle, an act of public policy or a \npolitical programme is to show what makes it preferable to alternatives, with reference \nexplicitly or implicitly to a certain set of normative commitments.  Likewise, to criticise \nis to reverse this relationship so as to indicate the superiority of the comparator (the \nalternative evoked), even if this alternative is counter-factual.  Central to processes of \njustification is the systematic generation of principled alternatives. We shall return to \nsome implications of this view in the section that follows. \n Our second claim is that political justification is likely to be enriched when part of \nan adversarial process, involving the interaction of multiple political agents.  This is so \nbecause rather than arising naturally as part of an introspective process of \ncontemplation, justifications imply a relational dimension. They are invoked in \nsituations of encounter, when agents interact with others and are moved to give reasons \nfor adopting certain viewpoints or courses of action rather than others.  If just one \npolitical agent is responsible for generating proposals and the comparators by which \nthey are evaluated, there will be little incentive to engage in the challenging scrutiny of \nthose proposals.  Insofar as offering plausible alternatives is burdensome, since it forces \nstronger arguments to be advanced for the desired option, where competition is absent \nthere will be a downward pressure on the quality of alternatives offered, and therefore \non the stringency of political justification.  Only in the presence of an adversarial \ndimension, where at least one other agent seeks actively to assess the validity of a \npolitical proposal and where disputing arguments are in turn tested, will the conditions \nfor meaningful political justification be present.  The point was well recognised by John \nStuart Mill, who grounded his defence of free speech in part on the idea that letting \ndissent emerge through the open contestation of political views serves to improve \npublic argument, weeding out weaker opinions and consolidating the good.  He was \nemphatic that counter-arguments carry most force when voiced by someone who \nbelieves in them, not when they are the product of disinterested speculation (Mill 1991 \/ \n12 \n \n1861, p.42).13  One should be sceptical of any notion that justification can be a \nconsensual process pursued by an undivided whole.   \n Thirdly, if these processes of political justification are to resonate more widely in \nthe citizen body, as they must if their democratic role is to be served, it is furthermore \nimportant that they have public visibility.  Arguments need to be amplified so as to be \nhearable by the constituency to which they are addressed, and they need to be cognitively \naccessible to that constituency so as to be acknowledged when heard.  Acts of justification \nrestricted to just a small circle of elites are ultimately little different from those aimed at a \npartial constituency, which as we have argued above make little contribution to the \ndemocratic idea of collective self-rule.   \n Acknowledging the comparative and adversarial features of political justification, \nand its need of public visibility, highlights the relevance of partisanship in the process.  \nWe wish to argue that the efforts of partisans to promote the normative perspectives to \nwhich they are committed act as essential systematic stimuli to the circumstances of \npolitical justification.   \nPartisanship is, first of all, a form of engagement implying a public comparative \nexercise.  Political views are developed and perfected in the process of confrontation \nwith other available alternatives.  Since the days of England\u2019s Whigs and Tories, and on \ninto the age of mass mobilisation, partisanship has involved political groupings of a \ncertain level of cohesion forming around different interpretations of the public good, \narising from distinctive political histories, experiences and traditions of political \nargument (White and Ypi 2010) (Rosenblum 2008).  Under conditions of mass \nenfranchisement, these political alternatives are then promoted to the public at large \nand modified in the course of popular engagement.  Most obviously in the context of \nelections, but also more generally in the course of public debate, citizens are invited to \ncompare between the various alternatives produced, be it at the level of entire \nprogrammes or specific issues.  To be sure, this comparative dimension may be negated \nin the case of factions, since to the extent the political scene consists only of groups \nmaking appeal to partial, pre-defined collectivities, individual citizens may be in no \nposition to make comparisons on how best to interpret the public good.  They may \nperceive their identities as so tightly linked to certain political groupings that they are \nunable or unwilling to consider others.  But where the normative visions available are \n                                                          \n13 For in-depth discussions of Mill\u2019s treatment of dissent and the implications of his work for a theory of \npartisanship, see Muirhead 2006 and Rosenblum 2008.  As the latter correctly notes (p.159), \nacknowledging the persuasiveness of his views on contestation does not require one to endorse further \narguments he makes concerning how the \u2018fractional truths\u2019 advanced by different sides cumulate with \none another to form more comprehensive wholes. \n13 \n \nthose one can associate with parties, addressed to a good which is not reducible to parts, \nthis comparative dimension is well served.    \nMoreover, these distinctive normative perspectives have generally matured in \ncircumstances of conflict with other partisan agents.  Partisanship breeds the conditions \nof adversarialism necessary to the generation and testing of acts of justification. \nAttempts to disseminate justifications \u2013 and to provoke them from others \u2013 are most \nlikely to emerge in the context of political conflict, as one agent seeks public recognition \nand attempts to apply pressure to an opponent.14  The presence of different partisan \ngroupings in framing the terms of political justification allows us to understand more \nclearly why it is difficult for certain political conflicts to be discursively solved in \nadvance of practical confrontation.  Even if the process of political justification starts \nfrom premises accessible to all, the task of articulating these, criticizing them, rendering \nthem part of a more complete political argument, and linking them to day-to-day \nconcerns is completed through partisan action.15 \n  Partisanship also contributes a clearer understanding of the terms of political \njustification.  To the extent that partisans coordinate around a relatively well-defined \nprofile, this acts as a signpost to the kind of criticisms they are vulnerable to and those \nthey are well placed to levy at others (Johnson 2006).  Such acts of political signposting \nare what defines the contribution of partisanship to the visibility of political justification. \nThe normative orientations by which partisans identify themselves make clearer the \npremises of each justificatory move: a known sensitivity to this or that moral and \npolitical principle (say individual liberty or group rights) helps elucidate some of the \nlarger ideas behind a particular line of political argumentation.  Of course, these \norientations become problematic when their starting assumptions are left unexplored in \npublic debate \u2013 i.e. when they are depoliticised \u2013 or when partisans themselves leave \nthem permanently unquestioned, preferring party loyalty to an examination of the \nprinciples on which it is based.  But it is the existence of partisan alignments of some \nlevel of consistency which makes such omissions possible to identify.  Furthermore, \nbecause their goal is to cultivate public support, partisans have reason to render these \norganising principles in a way which is meaningful and intelligible to a wider public.  \nQuite different is the discourse of non-partisan authorities which do not compete for \npublic approval \u2013 technocratic institutions, for instance, or constitutional courts \u2013 which \nmay be content, insofar as they offer public justifications at all, to couch them in terms \n                                                          \n14 This point applies both to the intellectual activities of programmatic innovation and to the day-to-day \n\u2018scut work\u2019 (Walzer 2007, p.141) required to facilitate the wider public adoption of these ideas. \n15 On the relevance of parties to these processes, see also Christiano 1996. \n14 \n \nimpenetrable to most citizens.  Rendering justification visible is something likely to \nrequire a collaborative effort by groups of citizens acting in concert.   \nTo be sure, not all partisans consistently adhere to these standards.  Sometimes \nthey may be tempted to compromise their principles for strategic purposes, turning \nthem temporarily into a source of confusion.  Sometimes they may downplay their \nideational commitments so as to present themselves primarily as a collection of \npersonalities.  We shall return to such \u2018pathologies\u2019 of partisanship in a later section.  For \nnow though, let us simply note how the circumstances of political justification flow \nnaturally from the impulses at the heart of partisanship. \n \n \nTHE CHALLENGES OF INCLUSION, AND THE RESOURCES OF PARTISANSHIP  \n \nSo far we have focused only on the features of a supposedly well-functioning political \nsphere, undistorted by the failures of real-life politics. Yet even in the most successful of \ndemocratic environments, political justification occurs in circumstances less favourable \nthan these. Epistemic differences in citizens\u2019 capacity to understand complex social \narrangements, or the presence of pervasive economic and power inequalities, are widely \nencountered circumstances which may undermine its contribution to collective \ndecision-making.  Critics of political justification as a political ideal emphasise the extent \nto which interactions in the public sphere occur among citizens whose level of education \nor eloquence varies, with negative consequences for the capacity of political judgement.  \nIt has been observed how the division of labour in modern societies means there may be \na significant gap between the judgments of lay citizens and those of \u201cexperts\u201d (e.g. \neconomists, lawyers, professional politicians or even political theorists).16 These latter \nare likely to contribute with specialist reasons in favour or against a given course of \naction, and the complexity of their views (especially on topics requiring technical \nknowledge) may inhibit or weaken the arguments of ordinary citizens. If political \njustification is to make a positive contribution to democratic life, it is not enough that it \nsimply be made available for those who know how and where to look.   \n While many deliberative democrats are aware of these challenges and prepared \nto address them in various ways,17 there has been little reflection on how practices of \npartisanship make a distinctive and crucial contribution to weakening the force of the \nobjection.  Central to any such account must be the educative potential of partisanship.  \n                                                          \n16 For one account of the problems this might pose for democracy see Bertram 1997, esp. 577-99. \n17 See Cohen 1989 for an early discussion, Fung 2005 for a more recent one. \n15 \n \nPartisan fora \u2013 i.e. sites of partisanship within and beyond political parties \u2013 are well \nsuited to act as learning platforms for citizens, offering them the intellectual resources to \ndeepen their knowledge of complex political arrangements and the opportunity to \nbenefit from exchanges with political leaders and activists.  Traditionally these partisan \nfora have included party conventions, branch meetings, assemblies and protests; recent \nadditions include partisan websites, blogs and pressure groups (e.g. MoveOn in the US, \nCompass in the UK), or the online incarnation of older organisations (e.g. the Fabian \nSociety).  Such fora support the socialization of their members into complex political, \neconomic and legal affairs, thus acting as effective vehicles of civic education and \nempowerment.  \nTo begin with a literary example, one which, as we shall see, is by no means \nwithout real-world resonance, consider the effects of partisan engagement on the life-\ncourse of Etienne Lantier, the mine worker and protagonist of Emile Zola\u2019s well-known \nbook Germinal. The novel describes the political and moral evolution of Etienne, from a \npoorly educated and rebellious young man whose views have led him to be fired as a \nrailway mechanic, to an intellectually sophisticated anarchist activist who becomes the \nfirst worker to address the National Assembly in Paris. As Zola emphasizes in his \naccount of Etienne\u2019s development, intellectual stimulation and contacts were the fruits \nof his involvement in the socialist movement: \u201cHis own political education was now \ncomplete. Having begun with the neophyte\u2019s sentimental taste for solidarity and a belief \nin the need to reform the wage system, he had come to the view that it should be \nabolished as a matter of policy.  At the time of the meeting in the Jolly Fellow his idea of \ncollectivism had been essentially humanitarian and unsystematic, but it had now \nevolved into a rigid and complex programme, each article of which he was \nknowledgeably ready and able to discuss\u201d (Zola 1885\/1983, p.286).  That Etienne\u2019s \neducation in its completed form should be \u2018rigid\u2019 as well as complex reminds that there \nis that further dimension to his political persona \u2013 what we might call his \u2018wisdom\u2019, or \nhis deliberative ability to reflect on his education and adapt it \u2013 which remains \nincomplete and ripe for development in the experiences to follow.  The high-point of his \ntrajectory may be yet to come, but a crucial point in the curve has been passed. \nIn Etienne\u2019s case, as in the biographies of many partisan activists, membership in a \npartisan organization is a vehicle of intellectual empowerment (Walzer 2007, p.135).18 \nAn interesting historical example is to be found in Mahatma Ghandi\u2019s autobiography, as \n                                                          \n18 For further analysis and empirical evidence on the importance of political participation as a means of \npolitical education and intellectual empowerment see also Pateman 1970; Mansbridge 1983, esp. 239-\n247.  \n16 \n \nhe explains the role participation in the Natal Indian Congress played in gradually \ntraining members to voice public critique and engage in political reason-giving. Due to \nlack of experience, the process was initially a quite exclusive one, with routine activities \ntypically characterized by weak participation from lay activists. \u201cMeetings\u201d, Ghandi \nexplains, \u201cused to be held once a month or even once a week if required. Minutes of the \nproceedings of the preceding meeting would be discussed. People had no experience of \ntaking part in public discussion or of speaking briefly and to the point. Everyone \nhesitated to stand up to speak\u201d. Yet, as Ghandi goes on to note, with ongoing \ninvolvement in meetings, progressive exposure to sharing views in public debate and \nfamiliarization with the relevant procedures, matters improved dramatically even for \nthe most hesitant or unprepared activists: \u201cThey realized that it was an education for \nthem, and many who had never been accustomed to speaking before an audience soon \nacquired the habit of thinking and speaking publicly about matters of public interest\u201d \n(Ghandi 1927, p.148). \nThrough partisan practice, sophisticated political judgments and the sometimes \nesoteric terms of political justification can cease to be available only to minority elites \nand may become part of a joint intellectual stock, available to other citizens and in turn \nreworked by them.  Such actions amount to a \u2018pedagogy of the oppressed\u2019, one which \n\u2018makes oppression and its causes objects of reflection by the oppressed\u2019 as a prelude to \nefforts to address them (Freire 1970, p.30; see also Luk\u00e1cs as cited).  Are partisan fora \nthe only venue for this role?  Clearly there are other institutions with an educative or \ninformative profile (the school or the media) with something apparently similar to offer.  \nYet the kinds of experience made possible in partisan fora are distinctive, all the more so \nin circumstances where mainstream institutions suffer from the effects of power and \neconomic inequalities. Specifically political concerns are addressed in these fora in a \npractical and goal-oriented fashion.  Even if partisan membership ends up being an \nexperience which is both educative (as in the school) and informative (as in the media), \nit is never limited to either one of these, as it is pursued with pragmatic purpose. And \neven if alternative deliberative fora can go some way to performing the same function, \nthe more limited reach of these fora, their issue-specific nature and the ad-hoc basis on \nwhich citizens are involved in deliberation cannot substitute for the more encompassing \nforms of involvement in political justification that partisan engagement affords.19   \n                                                          \n19 The point is acknowledged in a pioneering essay by Joshua Cohen (Cohen 1989, p. 32) but the \nsuggestion to take seriously partisan fora is left undeveloped, and has not been taken up by other \ndeliberative-democratic scholars. \n17 \n \nThe broad agreement on certain shared political principles which characterises \npartisanship of whatever stripe acts as the basis on which individuals can develop \nconfidence in their views before having them exposed to more radical challenge.  \nCitizens who, still early in their political education, experience the full diversity of views \nin an unmediated way, without being guided to favour some over others, risk significant \ndisorientation.  When partisan fora successfully perform their civic role, they supply \nopportunities for political exchange which anchor individuals in shared normative \nframeworks while valorising the experience and judgment of each, and emphasising the \ndialectics of political argument rather than brute personal preferences which resist \ncompromise.  And even though the possibility of hierarchical or manipulative dynamics \ncan hardly be excluded, partisans retain the important capacity of exit. \n \nWhat of the second issue, the distortion of political justification by power and \neconomic inequalities, something which shapes citizens\u2019 vulnerability to manipulation \nand their capacity for political argument? This is another recurrent theme in critiques of \ndeliberative accounts of political justification. Political justification, so the argument \ngoes, is undermined when economically or politically powerful groups are able \ndecisively to shape the terms and the style of public debate, in particular what counts as \na legitimate intervention, rendering an unfair advantage to certain perspectives and \ncertain modes of deliberation (Sanders 1997; Young 2001).  Critical voices are liable to \nbe excluded from the processes by which justification is provoked and provided. \nAgain, partisanship offers an antidote to such dangers.  First, the inequalities which \nmarginalise such voices can only be challenged by strong collective actors.  Disparate \ncongregations of individuals and civil-society organisations may well lack the means to \ndo so.  Partisanship offers a support network, be it of tangible resources or of a \npsychological and intellectual kind, without which the voices of critical citizens are likely \nto be silenced.  To take another example from the activist world, this is one of the merits \nNelson Mandela identifies in the Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws, one of the \nfirst mass campaigns of civil disobedience organized by the ANC to protest against \ninstitutionalised racism: \u201cAs a result of the campaign our membership swelled to \n100,000. The ANC emerged as a truly mass-based organization with an impressive corps \nof experienced activists who had braved the police, the courts and the jails.\u201d (Mandela \n1994, p.129). Despite their practical shortcomings, practices of partisan engagement \noffer an important means by which to challenge apparently insurmountable power and \neconomic inequalities. As Mandela puts it, \u201cthe campaign freed me from any lingering \n18 \n \nsense of doubt and inferiority I might still have felt; it liberated me from the feeling of \nbeing overwhelmed by the power and seeming invincibility of the white man and his \ninstitutions. But now the white man had felt the power of my punches and I could walk \nupright like a man, and look everyone in the eye with the dignity that comes from not \nhaving succumbed to oppression and fear. I had come of age as a freedom fighter\u201d \n(Mandela 1994, p.130).  \nIncluding citizens in the practices of political justification is of course not just a \nmatter of organisational empowerment.  Even identifying the consequences of \nimbalances of power, and of the uncritical absorption of dominant justificatory \ndiscourses, may be importantly served by partisan fora.  Partisans\u2019 shared experience of \npolitical activism encourages alertness to the dangers of political instrumentalization \nand misinformation on the part of more powerful actors.  An important component of \ntheir efforts to construct alternative discourses on society is the attempt to exchange \ninformation with their fellow activists and citizens on the limits of existing discourses, \nand to raise consciousness of the problematic aspects of common-sense thinking.20  The \nadversarial conditions in which partisans act help them develop the necessary level of \ncritical awareness.  That their challenges to existing inequalities are themselves made \nwith power-political ends in sight is not to weaken their normative force: reason-giving \ncan co-exist with instrumental motivation, without this undermining its authenticity.21  \nPartisanship does not offer an escape from power relations, but a means to identify and \ncontest them.22 It makes available to the individual citizen a richer set of considerations \nupon which to ground her political judgment, without prejudicing the outcome of this \njudgement.23 \n                                                          \n20 Some of these arguments have also persuasively been made with regard to the democratic significance \nof social movements \u2013 see for example Dryzek 2000. Note however the differences between parties and \nsocial movements as explored in White and Ypi 2010. \n21 The recent literature on deliberative democracy has clearly come to terms with both issues \u2013 the \nunavoidability of power, and the relevance of instrumental motivation in constructing the public good, \nHowever, here too the role of partisanship is reduced to the stage at which deliberation is complete and \nvoting or strategic negotiation are required to step in (Mansbridge et al. 2010, p. 84 ff.). We wish to \nemphasise how partisanship has an essential role to play not simply after deliberation but as part of the \nvery process that constructs political justification. For an empirical study of how parties and the partisan \nfora associated with them may foster participatory democracy, thereby acting as sites of deliberation \nthemselves rather than simply complementing deliberative institutions, see Williams 2009. \n22 This point is particularly relevant in contexts where the voices of vulnerable social groups are unlikely \nto be heard: for a recent study looking at partisanship in South Africa and India, see Williams 2008. \n23 There are numerous empirical examples of how partisan fora may alert citizens to the existence of \nalternative perspectives on current political concerns. The example sketched above has echoes in a recent \npamphlet entitled \u201cThe Good Society\u201d produced by Compass (the partisan group close but irreducible to \nthe UK Labour party) which challenges discourses emphasizing the contribution of flexible work \nconditions to economic growth and insists on the relevance of social regulation and the role of trade \nunions in fighting exploitation. See \"Building the Good Society: The Project of the Democratic Left.\" p. 11. \n19 \n \nTo fully understand why this is so, we must examine more closely how partisan \nconfrontation contributes to shaping and challenging the judgments to which political \njustification appeals. This requires considering the elements of which justification is \ncomposed, in particular the premises to which agents make reference when engaging in \nreason-giving, and the common presuppositions they may want to contest in order to \ngive persuasiveness to a certain line of argument. \n \n \nTHE CHALLENGES OF PERSUASION, AND THE PLACE OF PARTISAN FRAMING  \n \nAt one level, the elements of political justification are fairly easily conceived.  They \ninvolve the provision of arguments supporting a given position on how to pursue \ncollective decision-making.  The agents involved face the task of drawing from the \nideational resources current in society (notions of public interest, or interpretations of \nthe basic terms of democratic discourse such as \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018equality\u2019), deliberating on \nthese, using them to interpret and categorise the social and political world, \nrearticulating them as political programmes, and justifying these to a constituency in \nopposition to those who would promote different perspectives.  The practices of \npartisanship provide both the necessary dynamic for ideational innovation as well as a \nfocal-point for cross-temporal continuity (White and Ypi 2010). \nBut discussing the elements of political justification requires focusing also on the \npremises on which arguments are grounded.  One needs to look at what is endorsed and \nwhat is excluded in any given line of reasoning, what principles and viewpoints are \nconsidered in need of justification rather than tacitly assumed, which issues are \nprioritized and which neglected.  Justification depends on certain premises being shared \nby the agent and the constituency: some degree of common ground, or \u2018frame resonance\u2019 \nas scholars of contentious politics term it, is required if justifications are a) to be \nrecognised and understood as such, and b) to be received as convincing.  The outcome of \njustificatory initiatives is heavily informed not just by the force of the reasons offered, \nbut by their level of correspondence with pre-existing schemes of understanding.  It is \nthis ideational background which influences the extent to which reasons are received as \nmeaningful and persuasive, and the practices of partisanship include efforts to shape it.  \nPolitical justification has \u2018ideological underpinnings\u2019 \u2013 not in the sense that it necessarily \ninvolves dissimulation (the conception of ideology as distortion seems in any case \n20 \n \nproblematic (Freeden 1996)) \u2013 but in the sense that it is inseparable from the \nhistorically-formed intuitions it plays off.  \nWhen asked how one should conceive the starting premises of political \njustification, political theorists usually insist these should involve claims that no-one can \nreasonably reject. What does this mean exactly?  It could mean one should be able to \ntrace lines of reasoning back to general commitments of the type \u201cfreedom matters\u201d, or \n\u201cpeople should be considered equal\u201d, or other such axioms. But these are undeniably \nabstract, and ostensibly similar formulations can lead to quite different, even opposing, \nlines of argument.  How then is initial plausibility conferred, and why do certain broadly \nshared starting assumptions take an argument in one direction rather than another?   \nTo answer this we need to focus on the often neglected tacit dimension \u2013 on \n\u2018common sense\u2019, as it is generally called.  Is common sense external to politics? We \nwould argue not: the trap would be to see shared premises of this kind as naturally \noccurring, pre-political structures \u2013 a kind of cultural inheritance drawn upon by \npolitical actors in the moment of formulating an argument.  Common premises are \nthemselves partly the outcome of partisan action, require partisan agents to develop, \nconsolidate and systematise them, and are susceptible to some degree of revision \u2013 \nincremental rather than comprehensive \u2013 by those who adhere to them.  The site of \npolitical conflict is then the discursive field as a whole, including its vocabulary, its \nsedimented meanings, and indeed its silences, as much as consciously articulated views \n(Freeden 1996).  It extends to the common-sense ideas invoked to express and lend \nplausibility to political principles, and to the connotations of the terms used to signify \nthe political struggle, even where these present themselves as part of a neutral \u2018middle \nground\u2019.  The language of politics does much to determine which propositions carry \nintuitive plausibility, which carry a burden of justification, and which alternatives will \nprove acceptable as the basis for compromise (Young 2001).  Those who would be \npolitically successful must both engage with this terrain as they find it \u2013 else they will be \nunable to articulate themselves and their political claims, and render these meaningful \nto a wider audience \u2013 and also, exercising their creativity as interpreters, seek to \ncriticise and reshape it so as to increase the resonance of the positions they take up.  \nSuccessful partisan agents are those who project their meanings onto the outcome of \ncollective political decision-making, onto voters and the wider society, and indeed onto \nopposing parties.  In this way they help shape the premises of political justification and \nthe persuasiveness of specific appeals.  \n21 \n \nThese efforts may take a variety of forms.  Terminological innovation and the \npopularisation of concepts is one: think for instance of the recent success of partisans in \nthe Green movement in planting concepts such as \u2018sustainability\u2019 in the public \nconsciousness, or metaphors such as the \u2018carbon footprint\u2019.  These terms provide the \nnecessary groundwork to allow the subsequent justification of policies aimed at \nreducing environmental pollution.  In themselves they do not point to specific policies; \nrather they open a space for political initiative.  Without discursive preparation of this \nkind, the force of such justifications will be weaker, and they may easily founder against \ncritiques appealing to established ideas of economic growth.   \nConsider likewise how the meanings attached to common terms of political \ndiscourse influence how certain problems are understood, and thus the extent to which \npolicies designed to remedy them can be successfully advocated.  Programmes on behalf \nof \u2018the poor\u2019 have been shown to attract 30-40% more support in US opinion polls than \nthose framed as on behalf of \u2018people on welfare\u2019 (Smith 1987).  Though the proposals \nmay be considered equivalent, \u2018welfare\u2019 can be understood as carrying additional \nnegative connotations of dependency, bureaucracy and waste \u2013 connotations which can \nbe considered the legacy of partisan efforts to load the term negatively. In this case, an \nimportant stage of political justification involves not merely advancing ideal arguments \non behalf of one particular normative conception as opposed to another, nor simply \ndeploying the skills of rhetoric to state these arguments in their most pleasing form, but \nconfronting the reasons for which common sense suggests certain views to be more \nacceptable than others, and examining how these background assumptions might be \nchallenged.24 Common sense, as one famous author puts it, \u2018can be questioned, disputed, \naffirmed, developed, formalized, contemplated, even taught, and it can vary dramatically \nfrom one people to the next\u2019 (Geertz 1983, pp.73-93).  The prevalent ways in which \npeople identify social and political problems, and the narratives of agency or \npowerlessness they draw on, do much to determine the kinds of arguments which make \nsense to them: if for example inter-ethnic tensions tend to be normalised, or if economic \nproblems such as unemployment are deemed to be global in origin and unsusceptible to \nremedy, political proposals to address them are likely to fall on deaf ears (White 2010; \n2011b).  All these elements of the ideational background shape the commonsense \nintuitions to which justifications make appeal and influence the level of their popular \nresonance. In a partisan perspective they are recognised as central to political \njustification, no less than the more familiar dimensions involving the promotion of \n                                                          \n24 For a similar critique to normative justifications see also Mills 2005. \n22 \n \nnormative views directly responsive to public concerns.25  Any politics of justification \nwhich is inattentive to the tacit dimension risks finding itself forever on the back foot, \nseeking to advance arguments on a discursive terrain shaped largely by its opponents. \n \nOne of the important ways justification plays off shared premises is, as we have \nseen, in its reliance on choices that depend on comparisons. These comparisons involve \ndifferent combinations of view regarding what contributes to the public good: personal \nfreedom, civic equality, social solidarity, individual incentives, ecological harmony, and \nso on. They establish the kinds of reason and criticism which are acceptable, the ideas \nthat need to be questioned, the facts considered relevant, and the mechanisms by which \nthese may be assessed.26  Their plurality and irreducibility to a single, universal metric \nare important reasons why one encounters multiple conceptions of the public good and \nwhy disagreement between them may persist.  What partisanship can offer is a level of \nconsistency and visibility in the kinds of comparison invoked.   \nPartisan groupings are likely to vary in the relative prominence they give to these \ndifferent metrics of comparison and in the ways they seek to combine them.27  An \nimportant dimension of partisan activity is therefore the effort to determine which \ncomparisons will be evoked in a given dispute, or are to attain ongoing pre-eminence in \nstructuring political conflict.  Partisans will prefer to invoke some rather than others \naccording to their principled commitments, and will try to define the nature of the \ndispute in terms compatible with these commitments.  Consider for example a public \ndispute related to the justification of public ownership.  Partisans who defend the \nprivatisation of a major state-owned enterprise \u2013 the post office for instance \u2013 may seek \n                                                          \n25 White and Ypi 2010 discusses at length the role of partisanship in harnessing normative ideas to \npolitical agency. For more historical and empirical examples of the contribution of partisan fora to \nprogressive political change, and a lengthy discussion of the dynamic by which normative interpretations \nof the public good are integrated with strategic concerns, see also Ypi forthcoming, esp. ch. 2 and ch. 7. \n26 For an empirically-informed examination of these themes, see (Boltanski and Thevenot 2006), who \nidentify six registers of comparison or \u2018orders of worth\u2019 commonly appealed to in complex western \nsocieties when justificatory arguments are made.  This pluralist account is quite different from that \ncommonly associated with party democracy (e.g. in the works of Dahl), in that the elements held to exist \nin the plural \u2013 orders of worth \u2013 each involve an appeal to presumptively shared criteria of value, to a \ncommon good, not just to particular interests and group-specific values (cf. Boltanski and Thevenot 2006, \npp.215ff.).  They therefore offer a vocabulary for political justification in the sense described here, not \nsimply negotiation and bargaining. \n27 Many contemporary conservative parties for instance can be seen as mixing comparisons based on \nmarket performance and creative entrepreneurship in the economic domain with those based on a \ndomestic model of personal bonds in the social domain.  Traditional socialist parties, by contrast, may be \nseen as making special appeal to conceptions centred on industrial productivity and social solidarity.  \nParties which celebrate the qualities of a leader figure (as \u2018populist\u2019 parties tend to) can be considered as \ndrawing on registers centred on individual inspiration and renown (to use terms developed in (Boltanski \nand Thevenot 2006).  Nationalist and green parties also have their distinctive notions based on cultural \ntradition and ecological harmony.  Note of course that parties will at times draw on the full range of such \nregisters and are in no way limited to just one or a subset of them.   \n23 \n \nto structure public debate and government research according to comparisons based on \ntechnical efficiency, productivity and market incentives, which give nourishment to their \njustifications for privatisation, and to resist comparisons based on principles of equality \nand social solidarity which could plausibly undermine these justifications. When \nopposing partisans in turn seek to criticise, they have the choice either to adhere to the \nsame metric of comparison as that in which the justification is made, arguing that it is \nweak on its own terms, or alternatively to adopt the perspective of a different metric \u2013 \nan approach which rules out a mere technical adjudication and produces a more \nfundamental clash of political views.  Over the longer term, partisans contribute to \nshaping the political culture around them, embedding certain metrics and ways of seeing \nat the expense of others.  That different partisan groupings draw on these differently \nneed not entail cultural relativism, the impossibility of political agreement, or the need \nto privatise most major concerns: precisely because these metrics may be regarded as \nwidely available across societies, and not each the preserve of particular subgroups \nwithin them, there exists the possibility of reaching political compromise by agreeing to \nprioritise a certain register in a given context, or by developing a composite position \nwhich combines elements of more than one.28 \n \n \nPATHOLOGIES OF PARTISANSHIP \n \nHow closely, it may be asked, does \u2018really existing partisanship\u2019 mirror the practices we \nhave described in this article?  While attentive to the imperfections of the political world \nin general, our argument may be thought to rest on an image of partisanship which \nmanifests itself rarely.  We have presented partisanship in largely ideal-typical terms, \ninformed by historical examples but centred on what partisans at their best can \nachieve.29  Like theorists of partisanship in many ages (Burke included), perhaps we risk \ncondemning ourselves to matching a defence of the party idea with an inevitable lament \nconcerning parties as they actually exist.  Partisan political justification would then seem \na rather precious suggestion.  Let us examine the concern more closely. \nThere are several \u2018pathologies\u2019 of partisanship one might highlight.  They \ncombine tendencies that seem unavoidable in partisanship in general with those \n                                                          \n28 Cf. (Boltanski and Thevenot 2006) chaps. 9 and 10.  Note that a compromise of either kind remains \nsusceptible to critique from an excluded register, and is therefore more fragile and liable to relapse into \ncontestation than the kinds of consensus generally envisaged by deliberative theorists. \n29 Further elaboration of the role of parties understood as ideal-types can be found in White and Ypi 2010. \n24 \n \nostensibly bound up in certain historical conditions.  First, as a challenge to the notion \nthat partisans make political conflict intelligible to a wider public, it may be said that \noften they have quite the opposite tendency to make things more obscure, e.g. by \navoiding clear pronouncements about where they stand on key issues.  Notwithstanding \nthe advantages of a distinct programmatic profile, short-term considerations \u2013 say the \ndesire to minimise electoral losses, to enter a coalition, to pass an unpopular piece of \nlegislation, or to avoid responsibility for a past decision \u2013 may encourage a policy of \nobfuscation.  Aware of the need to keep their options open, party elites may have little \ndesire to inform and educate either the public at large or their own supporters \u2013 an \nempowered party membership in particular being a potential obstacle to the \ncompromises needed to achieve power.  Second, even where clarity and consistency of \nmessage are present, it may be said that this message tends to be constructed in a \ncapricious, less-than-reasonable way.  For instance, partisans may avoid articulating \nviews on certain issues simply for fear that they might divide the party \u2013 as many \nEuropean parties are said to do on the question of support or opposition for the \nEuropean Union \u2013 or conversely they may talk up certain issues not because they are \nintrinsically important but because they can generate an effective emotional response in \nthe electorate or can usefully divide competing parties.  The consequence may be a \npublic debate in which key concerns fail to be aired while others are exaggerated and \nclustered arbitrarily. \nPerhaps a third objection is the most critical: that partisanship furthermore lacks \na self-correcting mechanism for dealing with dysfunctions exactly such as these.  \nPartisans, it may be said, are ultimately conformists: they put loyalty to their fellows \nabove loyalty to reason and to their consciences (Muirhead 2010, 2006).  In this view, \nrather than spontaneously forming allegiances and a common identity with those with \nwhom they share similar opinions, they pick up the sense of common identity first and \nwork backwards to the opinions they believe they should therefore hold.  They engage \nin a perverse logic which prevents the individual partisan thinking rationally and \nindependently.  As a result, when the partisan collective deviates from the commitments \none might wish it to hold to, the individual partisan may be thought unlikely to speak \nout in opposition. \nIn all these concerns is the suspicion that the defining principle of partisanship is \nliable to slip from political justification to political strategy.  However much partisans \nmay present themselves as groupings united in pursuit of common goals or in defence \nof threatened values, the sceptic will say that, amongst those who matter \u2013 the \n25 \n \nleadership in particular \u2013 the ideational bond plays second fiddle to hard-headed \ncalculation, be it to maximise party support or to cause difficulty for an opponent.  \nWhatever contribution partisanship can make to political justification is then too \nprecarious to be the object of acclaim. \nThere can be no doubt that the evolution of many political parties in the \ntwentieth century and beyond offers evidence in support of these concerns.  Political \nscientists have charted the widespread decline of the mass-party model and a shift \ntowards parties dominated by professionalized elites whose prime concern is not so \nmuch realising a set of ideas as holding onto office and minimising the costs of losing it \n(Katz and Mair 2009).  Changing relations of power have seen the rise of the \u2018party in \npublic office\u2019 at the expense of the \u2018party in central office\u2019 and the \u2018party on the ground\u2019, \nleading to relative autonomy for precisely those most prone to cynical tactics and blind \nloyalty \u2013 the party elites who stand immediately to gain.  Here lies a major challenge to \npartisan political justification.  Scholars of intra-party democracy have highlighted how \nthe maintenance of a distinct partisan profile can be undermined when party elites \ndecouple themselves from the demands and orientations of the partisan base and from \nself-organised groups in society (Ware 1996). \nSome of these pathologies may be considered intrinsic to partisan practices \nwhile others seem to result from larger institutional developments and depoliticizing \ntrends in contemporary democracy. The former present a specific challenge to our \ndefence of partisanship and deserve to be taken seriously even by those interested in \narguments of a primarily normative rather than descriptive kind. The key question, of \ncourse, is how political justification would look were we to dismiss partisanship \naltogether rather than support efforts to counter some of the noted pathologies. One \nneeds to think about how political justification would feature in a \u2018no-party democracy\u2019 \n(Goodin 2008, pp. 205 ff.) in the absence of the adversarial conditions by virtue of which \npartisans at least try (though they may frequently fail) to signal alternatives, scrutinize \npresuppositions, and critically engage with each other\u2019s reasoning in the light of \ndifferent conceptions of the public good.  Politics in such a scenario would no longer be \ndriven by a collective exchange of reasons but by individuals and groups acting in an \nuncoordinated fashion and lacking a collective mechanism for articulating and \nexpressing the claims motivating their actions in the public sphere (White and Ypi 2010, \nsee also Goodin 2008, p. 213). Arguably the probable outcome would be the justification \nof power in terms even more personalistic, conformist and prone to political \nmanipulation. As we have shown elsewhere, in the absence of partisan practices one \n26 \n \nwould need to rest one\u2019s hopes on morally committed individuals or ad-hoc groups \u2013 \nneither of which can offer the normative, motivational and executive resources needed \nto cultivate citizens\u2019 conviction in the worth of political agency (White and Ypi 2010),  \nUnder such conditions, political pathologies become even harder to avoid; the focus on \nstrategy at the expense of justification is liable to become the norm rather than the \nexception. In short, political justification in a no-party democracy is yet more difficult to \nsustain than in a democracy where citizens act together, aware of the potential \npathologies of partisanship, yet still committed to the forms of reciprocal engagement it \nmakes available. \nTo the extent that the pathologies of partisanship are a function of larger trends \nin contemporary politics, they equally threaten other forms of civic engagement and \nsites of justification, be they social movements, interest groups, standard deliberative \nfora, or courts of justice.30 This holds true for instance of the narrowing of the space for \npolitical initiative which processes of globalisation may entail.  While such \ndevelopments undoubtedly raise challenges for partisanship, the burden of argument \nfalls on those who would claim alternative modes of engagement are less afflicted than \nparties.  In other words, if at the root of the pathologies identified are empirical \nphenomena such as the tendency for decision-making power to escape mass control and \nto shift to technocratic and elite-driven institutions, this represents a major problem for \nthe defence of any mechanism of political participation that aspires to be minimally \naccountable. A defence of partisanship should then be seen as contributing to a \ncollective effort to rescue contemporary democracies from these problematic trends, \nrather than as an independent, \u2018stand-or-fall\u2019 alternative to be assessed in isolation.  \nMoreover, if real-world tendencies must not be overlooked, it is worth noting \nsome of the more promising trends also to be found in the partisan world. In the \nhierarchical organisational models of the twentieth century, the negative trajectories \nwe have described were a consistent possibility.  An \u2018iron law of oligarchy\u2019 was \ndiscernible from early on for those with the insight to discern it (Michels 1959 \/ 1915).  \nBut the contemporary political scene is rapidly evolving in ways which reopen these \nquestions.  The emergence in recent years of new media of communication and \nalternative fora of political participation offer important possibilities for restraining \ncentralist tendencies.  Partisans beyond the confines of elite party structures, perhaps \neven beyond the party itself, have new opportunities for holding leaders to account by \n                                                          \n30 We will return to this point below; note that we have contrasted the specific contribution of \npartisanship relative to other forms of civic engagement in White and Ypi 2010. \n27 \n \nidentifying and publicising deviations from their stated goals.  Commentators in the \nprint media, talk-show hosts, pressure groups and political bloggers have new power to \nshape the political climate within which organised partisans act.31  As well as being \nsources of political justification themselves, they are a further stimulus to its organised \nexpression at the level of party elites.  Partisan websites and organisations of the kind \nalready mentioned offer new possibilities for reviving parties as a source of education \nand community feeling, while virtual social networks offer the necessary access-points \nfor the hitherto uninvolved.  In the phrase of Ghandi\u2019s we heard earlier, they offer new \npossibilities for \u2018speaking before an audience\u2019, that dimension of partisanship too often \ndiminished in those party structures that have prevailed since the decline of the mass \nparty.  That these sites are fairly immune to top-down efforts to discipline them, and \nthat they are at one remove from wider public attention, makes them feasible places of \nunconstrained intra- and para-party debate.  They open the space for new levels of \ndeliberation under the partisan sign (Teorell 1999).  Clearly, party elites can choose to \nignore these developments, or seek to utilise them to further their control and \nsurveillance of the party (R\u00f6mmele 2003): the longer-term implications remain unclear.  \nBut the scale of these changes makes it unwise simply to extrapolate the future of \npartisanship from past trends.  For those who would seek to counter the dysfunctional \ntendencies in existing parties and foster their contribution to political justification, \ncontemporary social change offers some important new resources. \nFurthermore, where the pathologies of partisanship cannot be remedied by \nintra-party efforts at reform, they generate exactly the motivation for new partisan \ngroupings to emerge.  Denouncing those who have \u2018sold out\u2019, or who have ossified into a \n\u2018political class\u2019, is the favourite activity of new actors announcing their arrival on the \npolitical scene \u2013 and is itself conducive to the circumstances of political justification as \ndescribed.  The fact that, in a democratic political community, parties are not fixed in \nnumber, and that established ones must reckon with the emergence of newcomers \u2013 \nmade easier by the new communication technologies \u2013 is in principle a powerful check \non whatever tendencies exist amongst the partisan elite towards recoil into a self-\nreferential world.  Activating this dynamic to the full requires lowering the institutional \nbarriers to the emergence of new partisans, be they thresholds for representation or \nrestrictions on access to public finance (Katz and Mair 2009, pp.759ff.).  Correcting the \n                                                          \n31 For discussion of the growing symbiosis of partisanship and political blogging, see (Farrell 2008), \n(Farrell 2009) and (Farrell et al. forthcoming). \n28 \n \npathologies of partisanship in other words involves creating more opportunities for \npartisanship, not fewer. \n \nThe pathologies we have mentioned are internal to an adversarial model of \npolitics.  What if one goes deeper and questions whether the conditions on which \npartisanship rests are not themselves pathological \u2013 pathological for democracy itself?  \nSpecifically, if the reasons that people cannot plausibly reject are so vulnerable to \nongoing political interpretation, how can we be sure of the acceptability of what citizens \nachieve by means of political justification?  And what does the persistence of \ndisagreement tell us about the success of the entire justificatory enterprise? \n This question has long troubled deliberative accounts of political justification, \nwith the various attempts to address it contributing to what some authors call the \n\u201ccoming of age\u201d of the deliberative approach as a complete theory of democracy rather \nthan a mere ideal of legitimacy (Bohman 1998, p. 401). Most deliberative democrats \nnow acknowledge that even though political justification as an ideal ultimately entails an \nattempt to develop a normative political agenda that citizens can reasonably share, the \npersistence of disagreement need not defeat the very aim of political justification.32 \nGiven this shift, the adversarial conditions underpinning the partisan model we have \ndescribed are no longer considered so threatening.  Some deliberative theorists are even \nprepared to reject the notion of \u201creasons that all can accept\u201d as doing no work in settling \ndisagreement: despite the fact that the premises of political argument may have been \nreconciled in advance, the different exercise of political judgment may still produce \nirreconcilable outcomes (Bohman and Richardson 2009, p. 257 ff.).  Disagreements due \nto inter-subjective differences in the combination of these premises, or due to the \ninterference of different kinds of comparative metric, are unavoidable. And unlike \njudicial judgment, political judgment is always open to revision: the process is ongoing, \nand no decision or agreement may be considered definitive (Gutmann and Thompson \n1996, pp. 11-51; Urbinati 2010, pp. 74-5).  \nOnce attention is shifted from the outcome of justificatory practices to the \nnormative significance of the process that underpins these, the question of what forms \nof civic engagement are most likely to foster that process becomes pressing. As many \ndeliberative democrats acknowledge, the remaining normative challenge concerns the \n                                                          \n32 Of course, important contrasts remain between those who insist on strong criteria of acceptability of \nreasons along the lines of earlier Rawlsian and Habermasian discussions and the many who endorse the \nidea of political justification but express scepticism about the possibility of final agreement. For a recent \noverview see Chambers 2010. \n29 \n \nidentification of forms of institutional involvement that neither sacrifice democratic \nideals in the face of empirical obstacles nor adopt an overly critical attitude towards the \nexisting components of democratic life (Bohmann 1998, p. 401; Mansbridge et al. 2010). \nIt has been our argument that partisanship offers a significant response to this \nchallenge. In its absence, citizens will be but patchily exposed to political justification, \nweakly receptive to its claims and to their own opportunities to shape these, and \nworryingly susceptible to the sway of uncontested assumptions which narrow the range \nof persuasive arguments and privilege the status quo.  Partisan engagement allows \ncitizens to have greater control over the conditions of political justification, and \nfacilitates the emergence of critical political views.  The persistence of partisan \ndisagreement need not indicate that the principles emerging at the end of the process \nare wrong simply because they have not been unanimously endorsed. There will always \nremain a plurality of partisan groupings, each adhering to a different conception of the \npublic good, with differences that are irreducible. This however does not undermine the \nideal of political justification, provided that justifications arise from a process to which a \nvariety of partisans contribute their views. \nPerhaps one final objection may be made: that even though the normative theory \nof democracy is now able not only to reconcile itself with the presence of adversarialism \nbut even to appreciate its positive contribution, such a manoeuvre comes at too heavy a \nprice.  For might such a position not encourage moral scepticism, an attitude that, when \napplied to matters of public concern, defeats the very aim of political justification? The \nimplications of this objection are far-reaching, not only for adversarialism in general but \nalso for our specific defence of partisan political justification, since one possible \ninference is that a party that is allowed to stand for the whole ultimately affords no \ngenerally acceptable public standards of good and bad.  If the good of the polity is \ndiscernible only from a partisan perspective which is itself contested, what remains of \nits moral potency?  Here though one must be careful not to confuse moral indeterminacy \nand the possibility of open-ended decision-making with moral scepticism and the \nremoval of all moral standards from public life.  Indeterminacy in this sense is linked to \nthe idea that, within a frame of settled commitments, a number of contrasting and \ncompeting responses to the question of how best to interpret the public good are \npossible and welcome (Kateb 1981, pp. 360-61). That the best response to such a \nquestion may be contested is not to say one cannot speak of superior or inferior \nresponses. In the model we have been outlining, partisanship is an indispensable part of \nthe process that searches for such responses and seeks to adjudicate between them. It \n30 \n \nneither sanctions radical scepticism nor promises unanimous agreement. It contributes \nimportant elements that many theorists (including those who accept adversarialism) do \nnot always and openly acknowledge. Ultimately, it may not render each individual \ncitizen an author of every law, but it brings citizens as a collective much closer to an \nexercise of authority rooted in political justification. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIt has been the argument of this article that partisanship is a necessary underpinning to \npolitical justification both in the ideal world one might hope to live in and in the \nimperfect one which one can expect to encounter.  We have examined several \ndimensions of political justification in detail, concerning the constituency to which it is \noffered, the circumstances in which it is developed, the ways it is made inclusive, and the \nways it is made persuasive.  In each case, we have sought to show the relevance of \npartisan practices to the execution of political justification.  Partisan political \njustification emerges not as an oxymoron but as a valid account of how norms of \ndemocratic government may be achieved. \nIf partisanship plays the crucial role described, any lapse in its vigour will \nevidently be detrimental to the democratic polity.  Insofar as partisans cease to be \npartisans, one need not suppose the outcome will be a consensual public sphere.  Rather \nit is likely to be the emaciation of political justification itself, with a quite different mode \nof politics following.  One can expect political proposals to be grounded not so much in \nreason-giving as in appeals to brute interest and identity, i.e. those attributes regarded \nas beyond justification, and a general suspicion of normative argumentation to emerge.  \nPolitical activism is likely to come to be seen as governed by motives of self-interest and \nthe search for power \u2013 as factionalism, in other words \u2013 and political clashes to be seen \nas clashes between individuals and personal agendas rather than larger sets of ideas.  In \nsuch a world, attention to reason-giving and the impulse to evaluate normative \narguments is likely to give way to a concern to explain and unmask them, to construe \nthem as mere tools in the pursuit of material power.  If such assumptions become widely \ndisseminated, partisans themselves have every reason to conform to them, eschewing \nwhat then seem doomed efforts at reasoned justification in favour of the superficial \nconcerns of image and personality. \n31 \n \nNo doubt this is a vision that has some resonance with the trajectory of \ncontemporary western democracy.  Many are the media interviewers and editorialists \nwho prefer to focus on matters of political strategy rather than justification, whose first \nquestions when public policy is proposed concern not the worth of the proposal but the \nmotives of its advocates and its place in the \u2018political game\u2019.  If the arguments of this \narticle are endorsed, moves towards the displacement of partisan practices of \njustification can only be a matter for concern, for they can then no longer play their basic \nrole in linking decision-making to collective conceptions of the public good.  Such \ndevelopments are to be followed with concern, for partisanship and political \njustification seem essentially intertwined. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBall, Terence (1989), \u2018Party\u2019, in Ball, James Farr and Russell L.
