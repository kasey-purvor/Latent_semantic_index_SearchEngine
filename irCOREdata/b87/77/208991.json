Introduction \n \nA great challenge for democracy is the resolution of conflict between divergent individual \npreferences, views or interests. Sometimes it is held that democracy is about finding \"the will \nof the people\", but if the \"wills\" of different individuals bear little resemblance to each other, \nit may be hard to extract anything from the set of individual \"wills\" that can plausibly be \nconsidered \"the will of the people\". \n \nCondorcet's famous paradox captures some of these problems. If there are three individuals, \nwhere one prefers option x to option y to option z, the second prefers option y to option z to \noption x, and the third prefers option z to option x to option y, then there exist a majority for x \nagainst y, a majority for y against z, and a majority for z against x. This means that, if pairwise \nmajority voting is the method for aggregating individual preferences into collective ones, or \nmore grandly, for extracting \"the will of the people\", then the resulting collective preferences \ncan be cyclical and thus useless for reaching consistent collective outcomes. \n \nMore generally, Arrow's celebrated impossibility theorem (1951\/1963) shows that, if the \ndomain of admissible individual preference input is unrestricted (the universal domain \ncondition), there exists no procedure for aggregating individual preferences in this domain \ninto collective ones in accordance with a set of arguably undemanding minimal conditions \n(the weak Pareto principle, independence of irrelevant alternatives, non-dictatorship and \ntransitivity of social orderings) -- conditions capturing the requirement, in a nutshell, that \ncollective preferences be both minimally reponsive to individual preferences and consistent.  \n \nThe difficulties posed by aggregation depend crucially on how divergent the preferences, \nviews or interests of individuals are. In the (rare) limiting case of unanimity the difficulties \nobviously disappear. If everybody had exactly the same preferences, views or interests, there \n                                                          \n1 Previous versions of this paper were presented at the 2000 conference of the New Zealand division of the \nAustralasian Association of Philosophy, held at Victoria University, Wellington, December 2000, and at the \nconference Deliberation and Decision, held in Wittenberg, Germany, September 2001, and accepted for \npublication in PEGS: The Good Society. The author wishes to express his gratitude to Stephen Elkin for his \nencouragement to write this paper, to Geoffrey Brennan, John Dryzek, Robert Goodin, David Miller, Philip \nPettit and the participants of the conference panel in Wellington for many useful discussions, as well as to the \nGerman National Merit Foundation for financial support.

But while unanimity is sufficient for the disappearance of the \nfamous Condorcet and Arrow aggregation problems, it is not necessary. Since Duncan Black's \nseminal work (1948), it is well known that Condorcet's paradox can be traced back to a 'lack \nof structure' in the relevant set, also called profile, of individual preferences across \nindividuals. Black himself proved that single-peakedness, a structure condition to be \ndiscussed more formally below, (jointly with the (harmless) technical condition that the \nnumber of individuals is odd) is a sufficient (though not necessary) condition for the \navoidance of Condorcet paradoxes. A well-known corollary of Black\u2019s insight is that Arrow's \nimpossibility result ceases to hold if the domain of admissible individual preference input is \nrestricted to profiles of preferences satisfying single-peakedness.  \n \nAt one level, Black's result seems only to confirm what we already think we know, namely \nthat, if the disagreement between different preferences, views or interests stays within certain \nlimits -- limits that are somehow transcended in situations like the one of the Condorcet \nparadox --, then familiar methods of democratic decision making, like pairwise majority \nvoting, are available for reaching collective outcomes in reasonably defensible and logically \nconsistent ways. But Black's result teaches us much more than that. It highlights an important \ndistinction between two different concepts of agreement. The two concepts are what we might \ncall agreement at a substantive level and agreement at a meta-level. It is this distinction that \nthe present paper will explore. The paper discusses two contexts of democratic aggregation: \nfirst, the context of preferences, and second, the context of sets of judgments over multiple \ninterconnected propositions. Sections 2 and 3 explore the two concepts of agreement in the \nfirst context, section 4 introduces the less familiar context of sets of judgments over multiple \ninterconnected propositions, and sections 5 and 6 explore the two concepts of agreement in \nthis second context. In particular, drawing on some recent developments in social choice \ntheory and democratic theory, I will defend the view that, when agreement is conceptualized \nin democratic theory and when it is sought in democratic practice, more emphasis should be \nplaced on the concept of agreement at a meta-level than is commonly done. Section 7, finally, \ntakes a step back and addresses the question to what extent it is acceptable for the stability of \ninstitutions for democratic aggregation to be dependent on specific empirical contingencies. \n \n2. Agreement at a Substantive Level and Unanimity \n \nTwo or more individuals agree at a substantive level to the extent that their preferences or \nviews are the same. Perfect agreement at a substantive level is the case of identical \npreferences or views across different people.  \n \nIn response to the problems of democratic aggregation, it is natural to argue that processes of \npolitical deliberation should be encouraged with the aim of somehow reducing the level of \nconflict between different people's preferences or views and bringing about greater agreement \nat a substantive level. In his account of the idea of deliberative democracy, Jon Elster \nsummarizes this view quite succinctly: \"The core of the theory [of deliberative democracy] \u2026 \nis that rather than aggregating or filtering preferences, the political system should be set up \nwith a view to changing them by public debate and confrontation. The input to the social \nchoice mechanism would then not be the raw, quite possibly selfish or irrational, preferences \n\u2026, but informed and other-regarding preferences. Or rather, there would not be any need for \nan aggregation mechanism, since a rational discussion would tend to produce unanimous \npreferences.\" (Elster, 1986,  p. 112)  \n \nIf successful, the view outlined by Elster may seem attractive. There are, however, at least \ntwo problems with this view. The first, and practical, problem is that the idea that democratic \n 3 \ndeliberation would produce unanimity may be unrealistic in many circumstances. People may \nagree on all relevant facts, and arguments, concerning different political options, and yet \ndisagree on their most preferred option. They may agree on what the environmental effects of \na new industrial development would be, and yet disagree on whether these effects should be \naccorded more weight than the expected economic benefits of the new development. In a \nrecent empirical study, Cass Sunstein showed that deliberation, especially if it takes place in \nclustered homogeneous groups whose members reinforce each other's views, can sometimes \neven lead to polarization of opinion across different such groups rather than convergence \n(Sunstein, 2000). Although none of this is to deny the benefits of agreement at a substantive \nlevel -- if it can be reached --, it should be clear that democracy needs to have alternative \nresources for dealing with conflicts of preferences or views in those (plausible and potentially \nnumerous) cases in which deliberation fails to produce unanimity.  \n \nThe second, and somewhat more theoretical, problem with the view outlined by Elster is that \nit is unclear whether convergence towards agreement at a substantive level (falling short of \nperfect unanimity) is the most promising strategy for avoiding Condorcet and Arrow \naggregation problems. William Gehrlein devised social-choice-theoretic measures of social \nhomogeneity capturing basically the question of how closely a given profile of preferences \nacross individuals approximates agreement at a substantive level. Using these measures, he \nshowed that, although there is a positive connection between the level of social homogeneity \nand the avoidance of Condorcet problems, the connection is much weaker than what one \nmight have hoped to find (Gehrlein, 2000). \n \n3. Agreement at a Meta-Level and Single-Peakedness \n \nBlack's insight is to ask not whether two or more individuals have the same preferences over a \nset of options, but rather whether there exists an ordering of these options from 'left'-most to \n'right'-most such that each individual has a most preferred position on that 'left'\/'right' \ndimension and prefers options less and less as these options get more and more distant from \nhis or her most preferred position. If there exists a 'left'\/'right' ordering of the options with this \nproperty, called a structuring dimension, then we say that the given profile of preferences \nacross individuals satisfies single-peakedness.  \n \nThe terms 'left'\/'right' are used here in a purely 'geometrical' sense. Any ordering of the \noptions along which individual preferences are systematically aligned in the requisite way \ncould serve as a structuring dimension, whether it orders the options from most urban to most \nrural, from most secular to most religious, from most architecturally avant-garde to most \narchitecturally conservative, or in any other, however esoteric, way.  \n \nBlack's concept inspires the following definition. Two or more individuals agree at a meta-\nlevel to the extent that they agree on a common dimension in terms of which an issue is to be \nconceptualized. They may reach perfect agreement at a meta-level while at the same time \ndisagreeing substantively on what the most preferred position on that dimension is. \n \nSingle-peakedness may thus be an implication of agreement at a meta-level. If the individuals \nagree on a common structuring dimension along which each individual's preferences are \nsystematically aligned in the requisite way, then the profile of preference orderings across \nthese individuals satisfies single-peakedness. However, since single-peakedness is only a \nformal structure condition on a profile of preference orderings across individuals, single-\npeakedness is logically less demanding than agreement at a meta-level. The latter is sufficient, \nbut not necessary, for the former. A profile of preference orderings across individuals may \n 4 \nhappen to have the right formal structure for satisfying single-peakedness without the \nindividuals semantically conceptualizing the issue in terms of the same common dimension. \n \nFurther, single-peakedness is not merely a consistency condition on individual preferences. \nTake the preference ordering of a single individual (over a finite set of options). Unless we \nmake reference to a specific structuring dimension, the question of whether this preference \nordering is single-peaked is vacuous or, to be precise, must vacuously be answered in the \naffirmative. For we can simply define this individual's most preferred option to be the 'left'-\nmost option, his or her least preferred option to be the 'right'-most option, positioning \nintermediate options from 'left' to 'right' in a decreasing order of preference (supposing the \npreference ordering is strict). With respect to this artificially constructed structuring \ndimension, the given individual's preference ordering is clearly -- but of course \nuninformatively -- single-peaked. The concept of single-peakedness becomes non-vacuous \nonly when applied to the preferences of multiple individuals, for it is in those cases that we \ncan ask whether or not different individuals' preferences are systematically aligned along the \nsame common structuring dimension. This is the sense in which single-peakedness truly \ncaptures a formal implication of agreement, albeit at a meta-level. \n \nNow Black proved the following surprisingly simple, and yet ingenious result. Given a profile \nof preferences across individuals that satisfies single-peakedness, order the individuals (let us \nassume for simplicity that there is an odd number of them) from 'left'-most to 'right'-most in \nterms of their most preferred position (their 'peak') on the corresponding structuring \ndimension. With respect to this 'left'\/'right' ordering of the individuals, the median individual \nis simply the one who has as many individuals to the left as he or she has to the right. Then \nthe most preferred option of the median individual will beat, or at least tie with, all other \noptions in pairwise majority voting. A simple corollary of this result is that, if the domain of \nadmissible individual preference input consists only of profiles of preference orderings \nsatisfying single-peakedness, then pairwise majority voting is a procedure for generating \ncollective preferences in accordance with Arrow's minimal conditions of responsiveness and \nconsistency. Moreover, studies by Niemi (1969) as well as Tullock and Campbell (1970) have \nshown that consistent social preferences, in accordance with these minimal conditions, are \nlikely to exist if only 75% or even fewer of the individuals have preferences that are \nsystematically aligned along the same common structuring dimension.  \n \nBlack's result suggests an alternative response to the challenge of democratic aggregation. \nRather than seeking convergence towards agreement at a substantive level, which may be \nhard to achieve, we might seek convergence towards agreement at a meta-level. A recent \nstrand of deliberative democratic thinking advocates precisely this idea (see Miller, 1992, and \nDryzek and List, 2000). The idea is that the key to a deliberative democratic response to \nCondorcet and Arrow lies not in the idea of deliberation-induced agreement at a substantive \nlevel, but rather in the idea of deliberation-induced agreement at a meta-level. As the \nproponents of this idea emphasize, it is much more realistic, if nonetheless still demanding, to \nexpect processes of political deliberation to produce agreement on what the relevant questions \nare rather than on what the answers should be.  \n \nSpecifically, the idea can be stated as a three-part hypothesis: \n \n(1) that group deliberation leads people to identify a single shared issue-dimension in \nterms of which the issue at stake is to be conceptualized; \n(2) that, for a given issue-dimension, group deliberation leads people to agree on the \nposition of each (policy) option on that dimension; and \n 5 \n(3) that, once an issue-dimension has been identified as relevant, group deliberation leads \neach individual to determine a most preferred position (his or her 'peak') on that \ndimension, with decreasing (dimension-specific) preference as options are increasingly \ndistant from that most preferred position. \n \nNeither part of the hypothesis is trivial, and since each part raises difficult social-\npsychological issues, I am not able to address these questions properly here. To give an \nintuitive illustration of the issues at stake, suppose in over-simplified terms that (i) the \nquestion of what issue-dimension is relevant to a given democratic decision problem is a \nnormative question, (ii) the question of where options are located on a given issue-dimension \nis (often or at least sometimes) a factual question, and (iii) the question of what structure \ndimension-specific preferences of an individual should take is a question of rationality. Under \nthis supposition, the success of part 2 depends on whether group deliberation can bring about \nagreement on factual matters, for instance by clarifying and supplying information; and the \nsuccess of part 3 depends on whether group deliberation can induce greater rationality in \nindividuals. While both of these requirements are not undemanding, they are clearly not \ncompletely implausible. The success of part 1, on the other hand, depends on whether group \ndeliberation can bring about agreement on normative matters, a much more demanding \nrequirement in many cases. The combination of parts 1, 2 and 3 is, in essence, the hypothesis \nthat group deliberation can bring about agreement at a meta-level, which then surfaces in the \nform of single-peakedness. \n \nIn some cases, an appeal to public reasons and generalizable interests, characteristic of the \nkind of group deliberation deliberative democrats advocate, may lead to the identification of a \nsingle publicly relevant issue-dimension, and in consequence to agreement at a meta-level, the \nimplication of which might be single-peakedness. But in other cases even the invocation of \npublic reasons and generalizable interests may not have this effect, because individuals might \nstill disagree about what is in the public interest, or whether, for instance, ecological integrity \nor economic growth should be given priority when such interests are in conflict. \n \nEven rational choice theorists of a more traditional orientation are likely to agree that parts 2 \nand 3 of the hypothesis are relatively undemanding, and that the demanding and difficult part \nof the hypothesis is part 1. Mueller (1989, pp. 89-90), for example, argues, \"[g]iven that we \nhave a single-dimensional issue, single-peakedness does not seem to be that strong an \nassumption. What is implausible is the assumption that the issue space is one dimensional\".  \n \nObviously, the question of whether the hypothesis that deliberation induces single-peakedness \nis empirically adequate cannot be answered by pure theorizing. List, McLean, Fishkin and \nLuskin (2000) have used data from Fishkin and Luskin's deliberative polls (on this method, \nsee Fishkin, 1997, and a Symposium in PEGS, 9 (2), 1999) to test the hypothesis empirically. \nThey studied a set of deliberative polls on topics of energy provision in Texas as well as a \nrecent poll on the future of the monarchy in Australia. In these polls, participants were first \nconfidentially interviewed on their opinions, then invited to participate in a weekend of \nintense group deliberation, and finally confidentially interviewed again, being asked exactly \nthe same questions as in the pre-deliberation interviews. The study showed that the post-\ndeliberation levels of single-peakedness were either strictly greater than the corresponding \npre-deliberation levels (in every Texan poll in the set) or at least on a par with them (in the \nAustralian poll). \n \nOf course, these findings are not the final word on the introduced hypothesis. There may be \nsituations that a favourable to its success, such as situations in which people, on reflection, \n 6 \nagree that a certain single issue-dimension (for instance, an ecological one) is particularly \nsalient and should guide their conceptualization of the decision problem. But there may also \nexist situations less favourable to its success, such as situations in which a decision problem is \nperceived to be so inherently multidimensional, or in which people's value priorities on \ndifferent issue-dimensions are so fundamentally different, that they neither agree on what the \ncorrect answer is, nor even on how to look at the problem.  \n \n4. From Preferences to Sets of Judgements \n \nThe discussion so far has been centred around the problem of aggregating individual \npreferences over a set of options into corresponding collective ones. Often, however, \ndemocratic decision making bodies are faced with the need to aggregate individual sets of \njudgements over multiple interconnected propositions into corresponding collective ones. \nThis need arises when complex policy systems or institutional structures are to be designed or \nchosen, where the various parts of a policy system or institutional structure constrain each \nother and consistency is of great importance.  \n \nA simple example will serve to illustrate the problem. Suppose the following three policy \nproposals are simultaneously under discussion:  \n \nP :  to introduce a special tax on gasoline (in order to provide an incentive to reduce the \namount of 'unnecessary' driving and thereby to reduce the level of pollution); \nQ :  to abolish a subsidized commuter railway system; \nR :  to give special tax benefits to commuters (in order to compensate for their commuting \nexpenses). \n \nSuppose further that everyone accepts that proposal R should be accepted if and only if both \nproposal P and proposal Q are accepted -- formally, (R \u2194 (P \u2227 Q)) --, for the following \nreason: If the special gasoline tax is introduced (P) and the subsidized commuter railway \nsystem abolished (Q), then society will impose an exceptionally great financial burden on \ncommuters, so that commuters should be entitled to some compensation (R). On the other \nhand, if the special tax on gasoline is not introduced, or if the subsidized commuter railway \nsystem remains in service, then nobody needs compensation. \n \nFor simplicity, let there be three individuals in the relevant decision making body, with the \nfollowing sets of judgments on the three proposals (P, Q, R) and on the proposition describing \ntheir logical interconnection ( (R \u2194 (P \u2227 Q)) ). \n \n individual 1 individual 2 individual 3 \nP yes yes no \nQ yes no yes \nR yes no no \n(R \u2194 (P & Q)) yes yes yes \nTable 1 \n \nNote that each of the three individuals holds a perfectly consistent set of judgments in light of \nthe proposition that R should be accepted if and only if P and Q are both accepted. Now if the \nindividuals choose to determine their collective set of judgments on the basis of majority \nvoting on each proposition, then they will accept both P and Q (each by majorities of 2 out of \n3), as well as (R \u2194 (P & Q)) (the latter proposition unanimously), but reject R (by a majority \n 7 \nof 2 out of 3). But this is an inconsistency, given the unanimous agreement that the \nacceptance of both P and Q is a necessary and sufficient condition for the acceptance of R.  \n \nIn short, propositionwise majority voting over a set of logically connected propositions can \nlead to inconsistent collective sets of judgements, even when all individuals hold perfectly \nconsistent sets of judgements. This problem is a version of what is sometimes called the \ndoctrinal paradox (see, for example, Kornhauser, 1992, Chapman, 1998, Pettit, 2001, and \nBrennan, 2000). \n \nGeneralizing this insight, List and Pettit (2001) have shown that, if the domain of admissible \nindividual sets of judgements is unrestricted (so long as these individual sets of judgements \nsatisfy basic consistency criteria) (the universal domain condition), there exists no procedure \nfor aggregating individual sets of judgements in this domain into collective ones in \naccordance with a set of minimal conditions similar in spirit to those proposed by Arrow \n(anonymity, systematicity; and completeness, consistency and deductive closure of collective \nsets of judgments) -- conditions capturing the requirement that collective sets of judgements \nbe both minimally reponsive to individual ones and consistent.  \n \nOnce again, the difficulties posed by this result depend on how divergent the sets of \njudgements held by different individuals are. I will now show that the two different concepts \nof agreement we have identified in the context of preferences can also be identified in the \ncontext of sets of judgements and that they here, too, point towards two different responses to \nthe problem of aggregation. I will also argue that John Rawls's idea of an overlapping \nconsensus (Rawls, 1993) can be seen as a special case of the concept of agreement at a \nsubstantive level and that it thus differs from the concept of agreement at a meta-level. \n \n5. Agreement at a Substantive Level and Overlapping Consensus \n \nPerfect agreement at a substantive level in the context of sets of judgements is the case of \nidentical sets of judgements across different people. As before, one might try to solve \nproblems of aggregation in the context of sets of judgements by encouraging processes of \ndeliberation with the aim of bringing about greater agreement at a substantive level. We have \nnoted in the context of preferences that agreement at a substantive level is a rather demanding \ncondition that may be hard to attain in practice. Now, if we are dealing not with preferences \nover individual options, but with sets of judgements over an entire set of logically connected \npropositions, agreement at a substantive level may be even harder to attain. \n \nBut there is one special case of the concept of agreement at a substantive level that may seem \nsomewhat more realistic, if still demanding. This special case is a version of John Rawls's \nconcept of an overlapping consensus. Often the sets of judgments on fundamental moral and \npolitical issues held by different individuals are mutually incompatible, in so far as these sets \nof judgments represent genuinely different comprehensive views of morality, including \ndifferent supporting reasons even for those judgments the individuals agree on (like \"killing \nhuman beings is bad\"). However, in a less fundamental and more pragmatic realm of issues, \nthere may actually be much more agreement. Given someone's overall set of moral and \npolitical judgments, this overall set will contain some judgments that the individual considers \nfundamental, maybe even 'axiomatic', and others that he or she considers less fundamental, \nmaybe more pragmatic and applied. Now it is perfectly possible that the different (possibly \nmutually inconsistent) fundamental judgments held by different individuals may nonetheless \nhave certain implications in common at a less fundamental level. This is logically possible \nbecause, if there is a relation of logical entailment between someone's fundamental and his or \n 8 \nher less fundamental judgments, this relation is usually a one-way relation. The more \nfundamental judgments may be logically sufficient to determine the less fundamental ones, \nbut not logically necessary. The former ones may logically entail the latter, but not the other \nway round. The less fundamental and more applied judgments are usually logically \ninsufficient to tell us what the underlying more fundamental judgments are. For instance, \nconsider how many different fundamental reasons might be adduced to support certain \nwelfare provision arrangements. One might believe in certain values of socio-economic \njustice and equality for liberal reasons or, alternatively, for religious reasons. Or one might \nbelieve that the main objective of the state is to keep the streets safe, to prevent crime and to \nensure social stability, and that welfare provision arrangements are the only way to achieve \nthis. Or consider how many different fundamental reasons one might have for wanting to \nimplement specific policies for protecting the environment. One might believe in certain \nrights of future generations; or one might believe that non-human animals have rights that \nought to be respected, or that ecosystems have intrinsic value. Or one might believe that \nenvironmental disasters would ruin the economy and that the only way to secure a successful \neconomy in the long term would be to implement environmental policies. Many other \nexamples could be given. An overlapping consensus requires the identification of a certain set \nof policy propositions (usually a proper subset of the set of those propositions that would \nmake up an entire comprehensive view of morality) such that, with respect to these \npropositions, it is feasible to reach agreement at a substantive level, even if different \nindividuals endorse the same judgments for different underlying reasons.  \n \nIt is an open question whether, and in what circumstances, processes of political deliberation \ncan bring about an overlapping consensus that is sufficiently broad to give rise to a non-trivial \ncollective set of judgments. In this brief discussion, however, two points should have become \nclear. First, an overlapping consensus in the sense of agreement at a substantive level over a \nrestricted set of propositions is a less demanding condition than agreement at a substantive \nlevel over all propositions. Second, the concept of an overlapping consensus is different from \nthe concept of agreement at a meta-level. In an overlapping consensus, the individuals agree \non certain judgments, without necessarily agreeing on the supporting reasons for these \njudgments. They agree on certain answers, without necessarily agreeing on what the more \nfundamental issues or questions are. In a sense, they agree at a substantive level, albeit with \nrespect to a restricted realm of issues, without necessarily agreeing on any meta-theoretical \nfoundations for their substantive agreement. \n \n6. Agreement at a Meta-Level and Unidimensional Alignment \n \nAgreement at a meta-level is defined as agreement on a common dimension in terms of which \nan issue is to be conceptualized. In the context of preferences, I have argued that the structure \ncondition of single-peakedness may be seen as an implication of agreement at a meta-level, in \nthe sense that if the individuals agree on a common structuring dimension along which each \nindividual's preferences are systematically aligned in the requisite way, then the profile of \npreference orderings across these individuals satisfies single-peakedness.  \n \nWhile Black's concept of single-peakedness is not straightforwardly applicable to the context \nof sets of judgments, we we will now see that an alternative structure condition can be devised \nfor the lattter context (List, 2001), and further that the new structure condition, like single-\npeakedness, can be seen as an implication of agreement at a meta-level.  \n \nIn analogy to the context of preferences, the question is not whether two or more individuals \nhold the same sets of judgements, but this time it is whether there exists a single ordering of \n 9 \nthe individuals from 'left'-most to 'right'-most such that, for every proposition in the relevant \ndomain of issues, the individuals accepting that proposition are either all to the left, or all the \nright, of those rejecting it. If there exists a 'left'\/'right' ordering of the individuals with this \nproperty, once again called a structuring dimension, then we say that the given profile of sets \nof judgements across individuals satisfies unidimensional aligment. It is easily seen that the \njudgements in table 1 above violate unidimensional alignment. No matter how the individuals \nare reordered from 'left' to 'right', it is impossible to get the required pattern of acceptance and \nrejection. By contrast, the judgements of the five individuals in table 2 below satisfy \nunidimensional alignment: there exists a single 'left'\/'right' ordering of the five individuals \n(namely: 3, 2, 5, 4, 1) with respect to which, for every proposition, the individuals accepting \nthe proposition are all to the left (they could also be all to the right) of those rejecting it. \n \n individual 3 individual 2 individual 5 individual 4 individual 1 \nP yes no no no no \nQ yes yes yes no no \nR yes no no no no \n(R \u2194 (P & Q)) yes yes yes yes no \nTable 2 \n \nNow, given a profile of sets of judgements across individuals that satisfies unidimensional \nalignment, order the individuals (again assume for simplicity that there is an odd number of \nthem) on a structuring dimension. Then the set of judgements of the median individual with \nrespect to the structuring dimension will be accepted in propositionwise majority voting (in \nthe case of table 2, the judgements of individual 5). And provided that the set of judgements \nof each individual, most importantly the median individual, satisfies the relevant consistency \ncriteria, so will the collective set. A corollary of this result is that, if the domain of admissible \nprofiles of sets of judgements across individuals consists only of those profiles satisfying \nunidimensional alignment, then propositionwise majority voting is a procedure for generating \ncollective sets of judgements in accordance with the minimal conditions of responsiveness \nand consistency used in the impossibility theorem by List and Pettit (2001). \n \nThe claim that unidimensional alignment is an implication of agreement at a meta-level may \nseem less straightforward than the analogous claim in the case of single-peakedness, but here \nis a way of making it plausible. Suppose, firstly, that there is a single common issue-\ndimension in terms of which all the propositions are conceptualized by the individuals, and \nsuppose that each individual takes a certain position on that dimension. For simplicity, we \nwill call it a 'left'\/'right' dimension, but a range of interpretations is possible. And suppose, \nsecondly, that, for each proposition, the extreme positions on the 'left'\/'right' dimension \ncorrespond to either clear acceptance or clear rejection of this proposition and there exists an \n'acceptance threshold' on the dimension (possibly different for different propositions) such \nthat all the individuals to the left of the threshold accept the proposition and all the individuals \nto its right reject it (or vice-versa). If these two conditions are met, then we have a situation of \nunidimensional alignment. As in the case of single-peakedness, unidimensional alignment \nrequires no agreement at a substantive level: in the case described by table 4, for example, \nindividual 3 and individual 1 disagree about every proposition. Unidimensional alignment \nrequires only the existence of a common 'left'\/'right' ordering of the individuals that \nsystematically structures their pattern of acceptance and rejection over the various \npropositions.  \n \nOnce again, the claim is only that unidimensional alignment may be an implication of \nagreement at a meta-level, not that unidimensional alignment is by itself sufficient for \n 10\nagreement at a meta-level. A profile of sets of judgments across individuals may happen to \nhave the right formal structure for satisfying unidimensional alignment without the \nindividuals semantically conceptualizing all propositions in terms of the same common issue-\ndimension. \n \nMoreover, like single-peakedness, unidimensional alignment is not merely a consistency \ncondition on individual sets of judgments. The singleton profile, consisting only of the set of \njudgments of a single individual, always trivially -- but of course uninformatively -- satisfies \nunidimensional alignment. Like the concept of single-peakedness, the concept of \nunidimensional alignment becomes non-vacuous only when applied to the sets of judgments \nof multiple individuals. In this sense unidimensional alignment captures a formal implication \nof agreement, albeit again at a meta-level. \n \nUnlike in the case of single-peakedness, no empirical research has been done on whether \ngroup deliberation can induce unidimensional alignment, or indeed on whether there are ever \nplausible real-world situations of sufficiently realistic complexity in which a profile of sets of \njudgments across individuals satisfies unidimensional alignment. But the mere observation \nthat agreement at a substantive level may be hard, if not impossible, to attain in cases of \ncomplex and controversial issues and that unidimensional alignment is at least less demanding \nthan full agreement at a substantive level should lead us to take the concept of unidimensional \nalignment seriously. \n \n7. Empirical Contingencies and Institutional Design \n \nA critic might be unconvinced by the claim that agreement at a meta-level and corresponding \nstructure conditions such as single-peakedness or unidimensional alignment open up attractive \nescape-routes from the paradoxes and impossibility results of aggregation. Specifically, the \ncritic might argue as follows. He or she would concede that, if empirical circumstances are \nsuch that individual preferences or sets of judgments satisfy the identified structure conditions \n(or approximate them to a sufficient degree), then aggregation procedures like pairwise \nmajority voting or propositionwise majority voting will generate consistent collective \noutcomes. But, as soon as empirical circumstances are different, the very same aggregation \nprocedures will fail to generate consistent collective outcomes. Social choice theorists can \neven make precise predictions about when such collective inconsistencies will occur. In other \nwords, what we know about these aggregation procedures is that they work satisfactorily in \nsome empirical circumstances (e.g. for certain profiles of individual preferences or sets of \njudgments) but not in others. The impossibility theorems further tell us that this problem is \nnot just an artefact of pairwise or propositionwise majority voting, but that it is more general. \nIt cannot be resolved by any aggregation procedure, except at the expense of some seemingly \nattractive minimal conditions. One would not like to design a house just on the basis of the \nobservation that there are some empirical circumstances in which the house would be stable, \nwhile there are others in which the house would collapse. Rather, one would seek to design a \nhouse on the basis of solid physical calculations confirming its stability. Analogously, the \ncritic argues, it is a risky ad hoc response to the problems of democratic aggregation to use \naggregation procedures like pairwise or propositionwise majority voting and to rely on the \nobservation that there are empirical circumstances -- like situations of agreement at a meta-\nlevel -- in which these procedures work satisfactorily, while deemphasizing the existence of \nother circumstances in which they fail to do so. Like a house, procedures for democratic \naggregation should be designed so as to work satisfactorily in all relevant circumstances (e.g. \nfor all logically possible profiles of individual preferences or sets of judgments). They should \nnot have to rely on the hope that certain empirical circumstances rather than others obtain. \n 11\nThey should be guaranteed to generate consistent collective outcomes, no matter what the \nempirical circumstances are. So far the critic's objection. \n \nThe general question this objection highlights is the following. Should political institutions, \nsuch as aggregation procedures, be designed in such a way as to work robustly under all \npossible empirical circumstances (at least within a relevant domain of circumstances), or is it \nacceptable for such institutions to rely on specific empirical contingencies that are exogenous \nto, and not guaranteed by, them? \n \nAt first sight, the critic's objection clearly has some force. After all, institutions that rely on \nspecific empirical contingencies may seem prone to erratic behaviour, just as the house whose \nstability can be guaranteed only under specific empirical circumstances may seem a \ndangerous structure. However, on closer inspection, the objection loses some of its force. \nEven the most well designed house, designed on the basis of solid physical calculations, will \ncollapse under some circumstances, for example if there is a sufficiently strong earthquake. \nStrictly speaking, it is therefore not true that a well designed house will be stable in all \ncircumstances. The critic might respond that building standards take that problem into account \ntoo. In earthquake zones like California, unlike in Britain, houses are required to meet \nparticular building standards to withstand earthquakes. But, if an exceptionally strong \nearthquake were to occur, even a house built in accordance with those rigorous standards \nmight collapse. \n \nThe observation that can be made from these points is this. Whenever something is to be \ndesigned, whether it is a house or an institution, there is a domain of possible circumstances \nthe house or the institution may be confronted with. In some of these circumstances (call them \ntype 1) the house or the institution may have perfect stability, while in others (call them type \n2) the house may collapse or the institution may fail to work satisfactorily. Rather than \nrequiring the design of a house or institution for which there are no circumstances of type 2, \nwhich may be difficult if not impossible, a reasonable strategy would be the following. First \nconsider the probability distribution over the relevant domain of circumstances, and then ask \nwhether the probability of circumstances of type 2 is sufficiently low (if still nonzero) for the \nrisk of instability under those circumstances to be bearable. For example, even in Britain the \nprobability of the occurrence of a massive earthquake is presumably nonzero. But as this \nprobability is low, it is considered acceptable for houses in Britain not to be built to withstand \nmassive earthquakes. In California, the probability distribution is different, and building \nstandards are adjusted accordingly. Generally, if stability across all possible circumstances is \ndifficult or impossible, the design of a house or an institution would have to be adjusted to the \nprobability distribution over the relevant domain of circumstances. The idea would be to \ndesign a house or an institution in such a way that the probability of corresponding \ncircumstances of type 1 is high and the probability of corresponding circumstances of type 2 \nis low. \n \nIf discursive conditions in a group of individuals are such that (a sufficient degree of) \nagreement at a meta-level and corresponding structure conditions are extremely probable, \nwhile the occurrence of profiles of preferences or sets of judgments leading to collective \ninconsistencies is extremely improbable, then the use of aggregation procedures like pairwise \nor propositionwise majority voting seems as defensible as the construction of houses in \nBritain which do not meet Californian building standards (under arguably undemanding \nassumptions about the probability distribution over profiles of preferences, it can be shown \nthat the probability of collective inconsistencies decreases towards 0 as the number of \nindividuals increases; see the appendix on the probability of cycles in List and Goodin, 2001). \n 12\nIf discursive conditions are different, on the other hand, then the use of such aggregation \nprocedures is much less defensible. The defensibility of an aggregation procedure may thus be \nsensitive to the relevant probability distribution over the set of all logically possible profiles \nof preferences or sets of judgments. This probability distribution will itself depend on certain \nempirical facts about the relevant context and the relevant group of individuals. Moreover, \nadditional institutions, like deliberation settings prior to the use of an aggregation procedure, \nmight be designed with the aim of transforming that probability distribution so as to reduce \nthe probability of circumstances of type 2. The defensibility of the suggested aggregation \nprocedures, then, is no longer an a priori matter (as typically viewed by classical social choice \ntheorists), but dependent on certain empirical contingencies, which might differ from context \nto context. \n \n8. Concluding Remarks \n \nThe distinction between agreement at a substantive level and agreement at a meta-level was \nmotivated by Black's response to Condorcet and Arrow. And, as we have seen in the context \nof preferences, the context of Black's own work, there are both theoretical and empirical \nresults in support of the view that the 'meta-agreement' strategy -- the idea that a democracy \nshould seek agreement at a meta-level through processes of political deliberation -- is a \npromising response to the challenge of resolving conflict between divergent individual \npreferences, given appropriate empirical circumstances.  \n \nIn the context of sets of judgements over multiple interconnected propositions, on the other \nhand, our conclusions must remain much more tentative. Again, the two concepts of \nagreement can be identified, and their logical status, even in terms of avoiding impossibility \nproblems of aggregation, is very similar to that of their more well known counterparts in the \ncontext of preferences. To determine whether a 'meta-agreement' strategy is practically \navailable in this new context, however, remains an open question for democratic theory and a \nchallenge for democratic practice.  \n \nIn short, many important questions remain open. Most importantly, we will need to tackle the \nquestion of whether a certain 'base level of cohesion' -- for instance, in the form of (partial) \nsingle-peakedness or (partial) unidimensional alignment -- is absolutely necessary for any \nstrategy of democratic conflict resolution to be successful, or whether democratic conflict \nresolution mechanisms can be made so robust as to cope with even the most extreme limiting \ncases of divergence. The impossibility theorems of social choice would certainly seem to \napply in the latter cases. \n \nBibliography \n \nArrow, K.
