Introduction\nMany siliceous lava domes are comprised of a malleable core, solid carapace and granular talus. \nIt is the largely degassed carapace on the outer surface of the dome which provides the source of \nthe clastic talus components. As a lava dome grows the carapace may become over-steepened \n3and collapse, breaking apart and generating talus which is deposited at the foot of the lava dome, \nand the structural domain it forms is the talus apron. Some lava domes tend to collapse and \nfragment easily (e.g. Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano, Cole et al. 1998, Sparks et al. 1998, Calder et al. \n2002, Wadge et al., 2008). Other lava domes tend to collapse less readily and form relatively \nminor talus aprons (e.g. Mount St Helens, 2004-2008, Vallance et al., In press; Major et al., In \nreview), or have no\/little propensity for collapse and have virtually no talus (e.g. Soufriere, St. \nVincent, Huppert et al. 1982).\nAt the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat, the talus apron is known to be a \nvolumetrically important component of the dome (Wadge et al., 2008). From the point of view of \nconstraining extrusion rates, accounting for material that has been added to the dome and \nsubsequently deposited into the talus apron is important. Also, from a hazard perspective, \nunderstanding what component of the dome comprises ductile continuous (gas-pressurized) core, \nand what volumetric component comprises fragmented, degassed debris, is an important \nconsideration (Simmonds et al., 2005; Wadge et al., In revision). What is less well understood is \nwhat role the structural strength of the talus apron might play in resisting growth of the core or \nprecipitating the sudden collapse of the core as a whole. The clastic nature of this material, as it \nsits juxtaposed to a growing core, may play an important structural role in dome stability, for \nexample a buttressing effect, and conversely a point of weakness during periods of intense \nrainfall (Carn et al., 2004). \nIn this paper we focus upon a period of dome growth at the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano (SHV), from \nAugust 2005 to May 2006, which began with relatively slow growth, accelerated to a much \nfaster growth rate, and ended in a wholesale collapse on 20 May 2006 (Loughlin et al., 2009). \nWe attempt to constrain how the core-talus interface evolved during this period and determine \nwhether continuum numerical models of this evolution can help to understand the eventual \ninstability of the dome. We use an axisymmetrical Finite Element Method (FEM) computational \nmodel for lava dome growth, comprising of core, carapace, and talus components (Hale, 2008). \nThe shear-thinning viscosity relationship of Lavall\u00e9e et al. (2007) and Newtonian behaviour are \nused to represent the rheology of the lava. Observed dome profiles, and extrusion rates from the \ndome growth period are used to constrain the model and generate configurations of the dome \n4during its growth evolution. In particular, we use survey data for the shape of the dome collected \nby the Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) and, for an 11-day interval in March \u2013 April \n2006 when the AVTIS (All-weather Volcano Topographic Imaging Sensor) instrument measured\nthe daily growth (Wadge et al., 2005; 2008). This instrument obtained information on the growth \nof one side of the dome and showed that the surface of the talus apron aggraded by \napproximately 2 m\/day. \nAfter summarising lava dome growth over the considered time-period in Section 2, Section 3 \ndiscusses the computational model and how the core, carapace and talus domains are represented \ninternally. We use the observed extrusion rates to force the core-talus model to evolve over the \nwhole period and discuss the results in Section 4 in terms of a comparison with the AVTIS-\nmeasured profiles (Wadge et al., 2008) and those measured by automated camera from February \nto May 2006. In a companion paper (Hale et al., 2009) we explore how the physical process of \nrockfalls, and their detection by the seismic network of MVO, can be related to the model \nresults.\n2. Lava Dome Growth\nThe internal structure of a lava dome is largely governed by the growth regime; which for SHV \npredominantly involves the transport of lava directly to the dome surface, near the summit, \nproducing shear lobes and spines (Watts et al., 2002).. Localized mass wasting occurs largely \nfrom the carapace and headwall of these lobes, particularly as they move outwards and encounter \nsteeper slopes (Calder et al., 2002). Less frequently, dome growth has been observed to be \nentirely endogenous with dome growth accommodated by the swelling of the core or via \nintrusion, which forces the crystal-rich surface to break apart and generate rockfalls from all \nregions on the dome surface. Aggregate dome growth is therefore a variable combination of the \ntwo end-member scenarios, endogenous and exogenous (Major et al., In review). Loughlin et al. \n(2006) (Figs. 25, 25) distinguished the different styles of dome growth, along with dome volume \nestimates from December 2005 to May 2006. An important point is that growth accommodated \nentirely endogenously occurs for relatively short periods of time, but during these periods large \npositive volume changes can be recorded.\n5Observational data for the internal structure of lava domes is limited. Nicollin et al. (2006) used \ngeo-electrical measurements for the Soufriere of Guadeloupe lava dome to construct a \ngeophysical image of its internal structure. They found that relatively stable units lie above a \nbasal inclined layer of highly conductive geological material; interpreted to be altered rock and \ncharacterised by a reduced internal friction. They also show that the lava dome consists of \nseveral domains with relatively high resistance, separated by conductive channels. This is \nconsistent with geological observations that the dome core is massive but cut by fractures. Herd \net al. (2005) considered the lava dome collapse event that occurred on SHV in 2003 after \napproximately three and a half years of dome growth and inferred the internal structure of the \nlava dome from a series of photographic images taken of the growing lava dome obtained by \ndigital camera. As a result, the location of shear lobes, spines and talus from one viewing angle \nhas been mapped to approximate the dome internal structure, assuming no further lateral \ndisplacement of the structures occurred after being covered by talus. Just prior to collapse, Herd \net al. (2005) estimated the core of the lava dome to be approximately 300 m wide and 400 m \nhigh and with a talus comprising of more than 50% dome volume. Wadge et al. (In revision) \ntraced the boundary at the surface between the lava core and the top of the talus over three \nepisodes of dome growth at SHV and concluded that the surface expression of the boundary \nmoved very steeply outwards with time as the dome grew. \nThe August 2005 \u2013 May 2006 Dome\nThe dome grew within the amphitheatre left by the huge collapse of the previous dome that \noccurred on 12 - 13 July 2003 (Herd et al., 2005). The extrusion rate was low for the first 4 - 5 \nmonths, with an average of approximately 1.0 m3s-1, and then accelerated to values between 5 \nand 12 m3s-1 for much of the rest of the growth period (Loughlin et al., 2006). Dome growth \ninvolved a combination of internal swelling, spine growth, radial and asymmetric shear lobe \ndevelopment. For the first few weeks the predominant regime was endogenous growth of the \nwhole dome. Following this, growth became dominated by shear lobe development (generally \ncomprising both endogenous and exogenous growth), punctuated by periods of entirely \nexogenous or endogenous growth (Loughlin et al., 2006). Some pulses of high extrusion rate \nbegan with largely exogenous emplacement of sheet-like blocky lavas in the summit area, \n6closely followed by inflation of most if not all of the lava dome.  In such cases, the inflated outer \nsurface of the dome typically develops a fractured or herringbone structure (Fig. 1) and shows \ndiffuse degassing. Endogenous growth of the entire lava dome was not observed after mid-\nJanuary 2006 when the dome began to develop a long-lived compound structure.  In general, \ndome growth at SHV is a combination of both endogenous core inflation and exogenous surface \nflow, as observed in typical shear lobes (e.g. Watts et al. 2002) and endogenous growth \n(inflation) of most of the dome is only commonly observed while domes are small (e.g. <20 \nMm3 DRE in 2005 - 6).  \nThe top of the conduit is situated in the upper western part of the crater at approximately 680 m \nabove sea level (a.s.l.) (Loughlin et al., 2006) and the crater floor slopes away from the vent to \nthe east (towards the open part of the crater wall and the top of Tar River valley Fig. 1). Largely \nas a result of this topography, shear lobes develop preferentially in the downslope direction i.e. to \nthe NE, E and SE and the bulk of the dome\/talus volume is also offset to the east relative to the \ntop of the conduit. Active easterly-directed shear lobes can therefore volumetrically dominate the \nlava dome and this is an important observation in respect to the modelling that follows. \nImmediately downslope of the vent feeding the SHV dome was a narrow ridge approximately 50 \nm high, a remnant of the earlier dome not removed during the 2003 collapse. This ridge \nbuttressed the new growing dome, initially preventing downslope flow with a slope of about 12-\n15\u00b0. By November 2005 this ridge had been overtopped and a substantial talus slope began to \ndevelop to the east. Until the end of the growth period there were relatively few small-scale \ncollapse events or explosions. The largest collapse-derived pyroclastic flow had a volume of \napproximately 2 Mm3, compared to the final collapse volume on 20 May 2006 of approximately \n110 Mm3. Talus formation via rockfalls, however, was vigorous and produced a large talus apron \nwithin the crater. This suggests that the surface of the dome (the talus\/carapace) was largely \ndegassed but may have encased a volatile-rich core. Wadge et al. (2008) estimate that between \n30th March 2006 and 9th April 2006, 57% of the dense rock equivalent extruded lava was \nconverted into talus, 21% was removed from the dome by pyroclastic flows, with only 22% \nremaining as core. This period of dome growth was probably not representative of the total dome \ngrowth period and would have been highly exogenous. Using a different approach Wadge et al. \n7(In revision) estimate dense rock equivalent volumes for the entire dome growth period to be 52 -\n47% talus, 3 - 12% pyroclastic flow deposits and 45 - 41% core. \nThere was a tendency during Phases II (1998-2003) and III (2005-2007) of the current eruption \nat SHV for lava domes to grow to very large sizes before collapsing. This behaviour contrasts \nwith the lava domes extruded between 1995 and 1998 (Phase I), which had moderate to large \ncollapse events more frequently (Calder et al., 2005). It appears that more frequent collapses tend \nto create a more heterogeneous, compound structure to the lava dome that perpetuates further \nstructural failures on earlier shear failure surfaces, while at later times in the eruptive history of \nthe SHV, dome growth has favoured lobe extrusion at higher extrusion rates. Higher extrusion \nrates tend to reduce microlite crystal growth (Melnik and Sparks, 1999), which can result in the \npreservation of a higher volume melt fraction in the core lava. \nThe 20th May 2006 SHV dome collapse event was very energetic, completely removing the lava \ndome over a period of less than 3 hours, with approximately 80% of the dome removed during \n40 minutes of intense retrogressive collapse that exposed the pressurized interior (Loughlin et al., \n2006, In prep.). From this we can hypothesise that the core was relatively intact, i.e. there were \nfewer highly degassed talus layers or structural discontinuities within the dome which allowed \npiecemeal collapse and thereby prevented the collapse from eating further into the dome. There \nwas no obvious build-up in overall seismicity in the hours or days before the event. However, \nthere were several episodes of intense rainfall over the volcano prior to the collapse, which may \nhave contributed to the initiation of the collapse of the dome (Loughlin et al., In prep). Two \ncollapse events, July 2003 and March 2000, that are also suspected to be rainfall-induced, \ncollapsed in a similar style to the 20th May 2006 event.\n3. Computational Model\nConceptually, we divide the lava dome into three units; a relatively intact and ductile interior (the \ncore), a largely degassed region of intact lava that remains attached to the core (the carapace), \nand a granular, friction-controlled, more distal region (the talus).  The most distal products of \ndome growth \u2013 the pyroclastic flow deposits are ignored here. The dome model grows \n8endogenously, in that there is no explicit pathway for new batches of lava to reach the dome \nsurface. As a consequence, this model is only suitable for considering lava dome growth that \nreplicates the large-scale structure and not the fine-scale detail. Modelling localised and hence \nexogenous dome growth would require additional physics, such as the development and \nevolution of shear bands and flow discontinuities, whose initiation and evolution are poorly \nconstrained (Hale and Wadge, 2008). \nFor our continuum model of lava dome growth with a talus we consider the evolution of two \ndifferent materials: a ductile core and a frictional talus. The frictional talus component is also \nconsidered to contain degassed carapace material. The axisymmetrical Finite Element Method \n(FEM) computational model for lava dome growth developed by Hale (2008), comprising of \ncarapace\/talus and core components is used and the model domain is shown in Figure 2. Dome \ngrowth occurs on two time-scales: continuous dome expansion, via the addition of new lava into \nthe molten core interior, and relatively instantaneous talus readjustments due the disintegration \nof the carapace and subsequent rockfalls. Because of the differences in the time-scales of these \ntwo processes it is possible to split the model into stages, a growth stage due to the addition of \nnew lava, and a talus re-adjustment stage (Hale, 2008). Although the rheology of intact crystal-\nrich lava core is reasonably well understood (Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2007), the rheology of the talus is \nless well-constrained. The rheology throughout the talus is not likely to be constant, but as the \ntalus wedge grows thicker the more basal regions may become more tightly packed and behave \ndifferently to talus closer to the dome surface. However, for simplicity we model the deformation \nof the entire dome as a ductile fluid, due to the low Deborah number, and vary the viscosity \nwithin the core and talus regions, whilst the free surface of the talus is modelled as a purely \nfrictional material that rests at an angle of repose. The model equations are formulated in an \nEulerian framework and the parallelised finite element based PDE solver eScript\/Finley is \nutilised (Gross et al., 2007). Modelling the free surface is of primary importance because it is \nhere that the talus develops and large deformations can occur, which requires a reliable and \nrobust technique that can cope with large deformations. For this, the level-set method is used to \ntrace flow fronts and boundaries without distorting the model space\/mesh (Hale et al., 2007).\n9We use a solidus pressure isobar to determine where core material turns into carapace\/talus. This \ncondition is used for two reasons. First, it is well known that as magma ascends and the pressure \ndecreases, volatiles can be exsolved promoting crystallisation and solidification (Couch et al., \n2003; Cashman and Blundy, 2002; Hort, 1998). Intermediate lava, such as the andesitic lava of \nSHV, is dominated by degassing-induced crystallisation with cooling being negligible during \nlava dome emplacement (Sparks et al., 2000). Therefore the solidus pressure can be used to mark \nthe transition to a solid state (Simmons et al. 2005), and we simplify our model by assuming that \nonly degassing-induced crystallisation contributes to the growth of solid lava, i.e. the \ncarapace\/talus, and neglect cooling. The second reason is that a transition to a solid state as \ndescribed by the solidus pressure is relatively easy to implement computationally (Hale, 2008). \n3.1 Model Formulation\nDuring a single time-step for the model, we first calculate the velocity and pressure fields of the \ndome material, talus and core, and grow the dome accordingly. Next, the extent of the solid\/core \ninterface within the dome is re-calculated and the interface updated. The interface between the \ncarapace\/talus and lava core is identified using knowledge of the existing core region. The \nupdated core region corresponds to where the dome has a pressure greater or equal to the solidus \npressure and where the dome material was originally designated as core. The updated \ncarapace\/talus region corresponds to regions where the core has a pressure less than the solidus \npressure or where dome material was originally designated as carapace\/talus.  This prevents talus \nfrom being converted back into core material if the pressure becomes greater than the solidus \npressure, which does not happen in reality, hence the necessity for tracking this interface. Lastly, \nthe clastic nature of the talus allows readjustments so that it becomes gravitationally stable. \nHence, material that is sitting on a steep slope will readjust to its angle of repose, which entails \nthe final stage of the model over one time-step. These sub-steps are repeated continuously to \nallow the lava dome to grow in time. See Hale (2008) for a thorough discussion of this model. \nThe axi-symmetric lava dome grows onto a horizontal base fed by lava from the conduit exit \napplied as a parabolic velocity field. The Reynolds number is defined as lavalavaVL \uf068\uf072 \/Re \uf03d , \nwhere Vlava ,\uf072 , L and lava\uf068 are the density of the lava, characteristic velocity, characteristic length \nand viscosity, respectively. Defining V as the average velocity of a Hagen-Poiseulle flow in the \n10\nconduit, we estimate for SHV values for Re of the order 10-7; hence inertial effects can be safely \nneglected. In other words, for the present problem the lava is governed by the Stokes equations. \nThe constitutive equation (given using Einstein notation) for a Newtonian, viscous material \nreads:\n,2 ijij D\uf0a2\uf03d\uf0a2 \uf068\uf073                                                               (1)\nwhere\n,\n3\n1\n,\n3\n1\nkkijijij\nkkijijij\nDdanddDD\nPandP\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf03d\uf0a2\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf03d\uf0a2\n\uf064\n\uf073\uf064\uf073\uf073\n                                            (2)\nand ij\uf073 is the stress, \uf068 is the viscosity, \uf028 \uf029ijjiij vvD ,,2\n1 \uf02b\uf03d is the stretching, ij\uf064 is the Kronecker \ndelta and P the pressure. The Uzawa scheme is used to solve momentum equation 1, with the \nsecondary condition of incompressibility, 0, \uf03d\uf02d iiv , (for further details see Gross et al., 2007).\n3.2 Lava Properties and Model Parameterisation\nOur model requires several input parameters including: the viscosity of the lava in the core and \ntalus regions, the extrusion rate or driving pressure, the solidus pressure, the friction angle for the \ntalus, and the shape of the lava dome base (Hale, 2008). We parameterise the model with values \nappropriate for the August 2005 \u2013 May 2006 growth period on SHV, but the model is generic \nand can be applied to other volcanic systems. Dome growth is assumed to have begun at 00:00hr \non 1st August 2005. Our simulation is initialised with a small mound of lava above the conduit \nvent corresponding to dome growth at a time of 0.45 days, a simulation start time of 10:48hr on \n1st August 2005, and has a volume of 10,150 cubic metres (0.1% of the final dome volume). The \nlava dome collapsed on 20th May 2006; 292 days after the eruption began, and this corresponds \nto the end of the simulation. Dome growth is assumed to be axi-symmetric in a model space 450 \nm high and 500 m in the radial dimension. A first-order element type is used with an element \n11\nspacing of 2.5 metres. We now describe how we set-up and parameterise the model variables, \nand summarise these values in Tables 1 and 2. \n3.2.1 Viscosity\nThe lava extruded at SHV contains abundant crystals and bubbles with a crystallinity estimated \nto be between 65% and 95% (Sparks et al., 2000). Lavall\u00e9e et al. (2007) performed viscosity \nmeasurements on crystal-rich lava, resulting in a singular dependence of viscosity on the strain-\nrate regardless of the geochemistry, the crystal content, and up to 25% bubbles. We use the \nshear-thinning viscosity relationship without a yield strength as presented in Lavall\u00e9e et al. \n(2007) for crystal-rich lava (Eqn. 3), \n\uf067\uf068 \uf026log543.0\/8974993.0log \uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d Tb .                                                                 (3)\nWhere b\uf068 is the effective viscosity in Pa s, T is the temperature in degrees centigrade (830\u00baC is \nused in our model, from Barclay et al. (1998)), and \uf067\uf026 is the strain rate. One limitation with this \nrelationship is that as the strain rate goes to zero, the effective viscosity goes to infinity. We \ntherefore use a minimum strain rate cut-off value of 10-5 s-1. This corresponds to a maximum \nviscosity of 3.4x1012 Pa s. It is appropriate to use this viscosity value derived from a strain rate \ncut-off because Caricchi et al. (2007) show that for strain-rates below 10-5 s-1 lava has a strain \nrate independent viscosity, hence in this regime the material behaves as a Newtonian fluid. \n3.2.2 Geometry\nFrom 1 August 2005 the lava dome grew on a surface that sloped to the east-northeast at about \n12-15\u00b0 with a restraining ridge just downslope from the vent, as described earlier. For \ncomputational simplicity we assume instead that the dome grew on a horizontal, flat surface and \ngrowth was essentially axisymmetrical, allowing us to model the dome using axi-symmetrical \ncoordinates to significantly reduce the computer solving time.\n3.2.3 Volume\nThe lava dome grew within English\u2019s Crater, which is open to the east-northeast. This means that \npyroclastic flows and talus were constrained by the crater walls in all other directions until the \n12\nsummit of the dome reach a height greater than approximately 960 metres above sea level \n(Wadge, 2009). Between 3 and 12% by mass of the dome was converted to pyroclastic flow \ndeposits during this period, however we make no explicit account for this in the model. Mass-\nloss due to energetic pyroclastic flows may be an important process at later times in the growth \nof the dome and could be easily implemented into the dome model by adjusting the dome free-\nsurface. However, without detailed observations of this process it would be inappropriate to \nintroduce this variable into the model at this stage.\n3.2.4 Density\nThe process of talus formation acts to increase the volume of talus compared to a unit volume of \ncompact carapace. This volume change results in a density reduction; however, for simplicity we \nneglect any density change from core to carapace to talus in our simulation. The rheological \nproperties of the lava dome may vary substantially within the dome. As the talus wedge gets \nthicker the more basal parts may increase in density and become stronger by pressure-induced \ntighter packing of clasts. \n3.2.5 Extrusion Rate\nUsing the MVO survey data of the dome surface for the period August 2005 to May 2006, the \nvolume change with time can be calculated. The process of talus formation increases the volume \nof talus compared to compact carapace or core and Wadge et al. (2008) used a ratio of 0.86:0.54 \nfor core to talus densities to normalise the resultant volumes. But because we cannot account for \nseparate core-talus volumes throughout this period we do not apply this here. In Figure 3 a best \nfit curve for the change in volume of the dome over time is applied and the cumulative volumeV\n(M m3) is approximated as:\nddd tttV\n22536 1020.21076.21073.3 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d ,                                              (4)\nwhere dt is the time in days. Using this best-fit volume-time relationship, the extrusion rate is \nobtained by taking the gradient, and this is used as the input for the model.\n3.2.5 Talus Friction Angle\n13\nThe angle of repose for the lava dome talus can vary spatially from being relatively steep (43 -\n32o) near the carapace-covered core (Fig. 4), to less steep (<32o) more distally. These values are \nconsistent with talus slope of 30 - 43.5o degrees measured by AVTIS during 2006 (Wadge et al., \n2008). Our model has a fixed value for the talus angle of repose through the duration of the \nsimulation, but we vary it\u2019s magnitude between 37\u00ba and 43.5\u00ba in different simulations. \nConventionally, it is assumed that the slope of the talus is considerably lower, approximately 33\u00ba, \nhowever, this appears not to have been the case at least during the August 2005 to May 2006 \nperiod measured. During the course of the eruption, the talus angle of repose has varied, and this \nvariation is probably indicative of how the talus was deposited. For example, during shear lobe \ndevelopment, there are likely to be numerous energetic rockfalls or pyroclastic flows and the \ntalus angle is likely to be lower than its critical angle of repose due to the additional kinetic \nenergy associated with these flows (Lube et al., 2005). However, during periods when dome \ngrowth is predominantly endogenous or where there are fewer energetic rockfalls or pyroclastic \nflow, the talus will rest at angles closer to its critical angle of repose.\n3.2.6 Solidus Pressure\nFor a dynamic system the solidus pressure or temperature is not likely to be a constant, but for \nsimplicity we assume a fixed value. Observations of the carapace (e.g. Watts et al., 2002) \nindicate that it is only a few metres to a few tens of metres thick. This suggests that the solidus \npressure can be relatively low. We assume that the solidus pressure lies within a range of 0.2-0.6 \nMPa (Table 1), which corresponds to a thickness range of about 4 - 21 m. \n4. Results\nWe present results for our lava dome simulations using both a shear-thinning viscosity model \n(Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2007) and a Newtonian viscosity model. The shear-thinning viscosity model uses \na strain-rate cut-off value of 10-5 s-1 corresponding to maximum viscosity of 3.4x1012 Pa s for the \nlava core and talus (Eqn. 3). The Newtonian viscosity model uses a constant viscosity equal to \n3.4x1012 Pa s for the lava core and talus (that is, a viscosity equal to the strain-rate cut-off value \nof 10-5, Eqn. 3). We vary the solidus pressure and the friction angle since all the other parameters \nare relatively well constrained. We acknowledge that it may not be appropriate to model the talus \n14\nas having the same viscosity relationship as the core. In the talus fine-grained infill and incipient \ncementation may start to develop a cohesive strength. The 2D packing models of Wu et al. \n(2003, 2004) show that for both isostatic and directional compaction modes, the density \n(compaction) increases rapidly at low stress increments from about 0.6 to 0.9, but requires much \nhigher stresses to reduce the last 10% porosity to zero. The reduction of porosity by rotation, \ngrain deformation and fine grain infill will increase grain contact surface area and hence bulk \nfriction coefficients. Thus there is evidence to suppose that the internal friction of the talus \nincreases and to account for this change in bulk system properties we can increase the strength of \nthe talus with respect to the core properties. Therefore, we also simulate dome growth using a \nshear thinning, strain-rate dependent, viscosity relationship (Eqn. 3) with a strain-rate cut-off \nvalue of 10-5 corresponding to maximum viscosity of 3.4x1012 for the lava core. The talus is \nmodelled to have a viscosity ten to thirty times higher than the maximum cut-off viscosity used \nfor the core.\n4.1 Dome Surface\nWe use our model to consider the free-surface shape of the lava dome as well as the evolving \nmaximum height and radius and compare them to observational data.\n4.1.1 Lava Dome Free Surface on 30th March and 7th April 2006\nA comparison of the simulated lava dome free-surface to the surface of the dome imaged from \nthe north-northeast by the AVTIS device on 30th March and 7th April 2006, (Wadge et al., 2008) \nis presented (Fig. 5). Figure 5a shows the lava dome free-surface for shear-thinning and \nNewtonian viscosity models as described in Table 3. The Newtonian viscosity model produces a \nmore conical shaped dome with a higher summit height and slightly smaller radial extent when \ncompared to the shear thinning viscosity model. Figure 5b shows model results using a shear \nthinning viscosity model for three models with talus angles of repose equal to 37.0 \u00ba, 40.0 \u00ba and \n43.5\u00ba. A friction angle of 43.5\u00ba produces results that are closest to the lava dome free-surface \nimaged by Wadge et al. (2008). Figure 5c shows that changing the solidus pressure has very little \neffect upon the free-surface shape of the lava dome. However, introducing a higher viscosity for \nthe talus region, a viscosity ten times higher than that of maximum possible core viscosity, \nresults in the summit of the lava dome becoming lower, wider and flatter (Fig. 5d). For all of the \n15\nresults presented in Figure 5, using a talus angle of repose equal to 43.5\u00ba produces the best fit to \nthe dome free-surfaces on these dates. Changing the solidus pressure does little with respect to \ninfluencing the dome free-surface, except slightly changing the summit height (Fig. 5b). Varying \nthe viscosity relationship changes the height of the dome in the summit region. A Newtonian \nviscosity model results in a summit region that is highest and slopes most steeply, hence a more \nconical dome. While the computational model that uses a shear-thinning (Lavall\u00e9e et al., 2007) \nviscosity relationship, but with a higher viscosity in the talus region, produces the flattest and \nwidest summit profile.\nFor all the simulated lava dome free-surfaces in Figure 5, the summit region of the dome departs \nfrom the inferred flat surface in Wadge et al. (2008), since AVTIS cannot image the summit of \nthe dome due to the grazing angle of view. However, since our core-talus model does not \nsimulate explicit exogenous growth of lava at the summit it may be less likely to provide realistic \nresults in this region. For example, the change in location and direction of the extrusion points of \nlava flow observed at the summit (Watts et al., 2002) will tend to broaden the summit area. Thus \na detailed comparison of the model simulations with observations of the summit region \nmorphology is currently unlikely to be productive. \nWadge et al. (2008) calculated that during the deployment of AVTIS, over the time-period 30th\nMarch to 9th April 2006, the free-surface of the talus grew upwards by approximately 2 metres \nper day. Our simulated dome results produce a slightly lower range, approximately 10 to 13 \nmetres over the 8 day period, approximately 1.3 to 1.6 metres per day. This difference may result \nfrom two effects. First, Wadge at al. (2008) imaged the dome from the active side of growth and \ntherefore the dome is likely to accumulate more talus due to the extruded lava being channelled \ninto the field of view of AVTIS. Second, the model we use is axi-symmetrical and therefore the \nvolume of talus is distributed equally around the dome whereas the lava dome on SHV was not \nperfectly axi-symmetrical at the time. Dome growth was primarily directed towards the east as \ndiscussed earlier which would result in a larger talus accumulation rate in this region. \n4.1.2 Lava Dome Height and Radius\n16\nThe maximum height and radius of the simulated lava domes with time for the different \nsimulations (Table 2) are plotted in Figure 6. Model results are relatively close to the \nobservational data available for the radius. However, the height of the dome as calculated by the \nsimulation is typically larger than that observed. The most likely reason for this is because of the \nmodel\u2019s assumption of a flat base. In reality, dome material will have tended to move down the \nslope to the east therefore reducing the mass and height at the dome summit as a result. Apart \nfrom this offset in height values, both model and observations show a near-linear growth in dome \nheight and radius with time. Assuming that the dome is approximately conical in shape its \nvolume can be approximated by hrV 2\n3\n1\uf070\uf03d . For the radius , r . to increase approximately \nlinearly with time, the volume must increase approximately as 3t , assuming that hr \uf0bb . From \nEquation 4 it can be seen that the 3t term will become dominant at later times in the growth of \nthe dome as t becomes large, suggesting that r and h should become approximately linearly \nproportional to t .\n4.2 Dome Structure\nWe now consider the changes to the internal structure throughout the 292-day evolution of the \nlava dome using eight separate simulations with a range of parameters (Table 2).\n4.2.1 Evolution of the Core-Talus Boundary\n3D visual representations of simulations (Table 2) the lava dome with a section cut-out at four \nstages in its growth, to show how the free-surface and core evolve with time are shown (Figure \n7). At early times in the simulation, the core is relatively narrow and the dome shape near-\nconical. However, at later times, the dome core has spread laterally and the dome shape departs \nfrom being near-conical to having a wider central region. \n4.2.2 Carapace Adjustment Location\nFor every time-step during the simulated growth of the lava dome, just following the sub-step in \nwhich the new injection of lava occurs, we calculate where the free-surface of the lava dome has \nan angle greater than that of the angle of repose. From this we can work out the smallest radius \n17\nfrom the centre of the dome, aR , and height Ha, where the dome surface is unstable, and hence \nwhere the talus needs to be adjusted to rest at its angle of repose. Figure 8a shows schematically \nthe location of aR and Ha. In our simulations, the talus region of the dome above the core-talus \ninterface with a radius less than aR is not likely to move significantly during each time-step. \nThis results in the free-surface of the dome in the region aRR \uf03c\uf03c0 sloping at angles below the \nangle of repose with minimal talus adjustment. Therefore, it may be better to class this region of \nthe dome as carapace, because talus will only fragment during displacement. This central \ncarapace is only a relatively small region and will have little impact upon the volume of core to \ntalus discussed later. However, by reclassifying this area, the carapace in our model effectively \nextends to the surface. Figure 8b shows the shape of the growing lava dome at five dates: 1 Oct. \n2005; 1 Dec. 2005; 1 Feb. 2006; 1 Mar. 2006 and 20 May 2006 with the regions of talus in the \nmodel better classified as carapace shaded as grey. \nThe evolution of core-talus boundary for the eight simulations is shown in Figure 9. The black \ncontinuous lines correspond to the core-talus interface, and the grey continuous lines \ncorresponding to the free-surface of the dome, at five dates for each simulation: 1 Oct. 2005; 1 \nDec. 2005; 1 Feb. 2006; 1 Mar. 2006 and 20 May 2006 (Fig. 9, left column). The core initially \ngrows primarily vertically in these simulations, before spreading laterally later on. This forces \nthe core region to become wider and the summit flatter with time. Lateral spread of the core at \nlater times in the growth of the dome results in the talus spreading above a layer of talus, as well \nas some of the talus being displaced laterally. There is less lateral spread of the core for the \nsimulations in which the talus is more viscous than the core (simulations 6 and 7). Also, for these \nsimulations the summit of the dome is slightly wider and flatter. \nAlso shown in Figure 9 (right column), are the incremental values of aR and aH , shown as grey\ncircles, corresponding to the point at which the talus departs from the angle of repose. There are \nseveral effects that contribute to the scatter in the results.  First, to calculate the slope of the free-\nsurface we must consider a region one element wide that surrounds the free-surface zero iso-\nsurface to ensure that there are elements within this region that are close to the free-surface (Hale \net al., 2007). Second, the finite spacing between elements and nodes means that when the free-\n18\nsurface angle is calculated, the angle is only known within elements of the mesh. For this \nsimulation, this corresponds to only knowing the free-surface angle at a radial spacing of every \n2.5 metres (an interval of approximately 0.5% of the domain). \nWhen aR is small, talus adjustments extend from very close to the summit (or at the summit) to \nthe lateral extent of the talus, meaning that the dome is approximately conical. However, at \nincreasing values of aR talus adjustments occur further from the summit, resulting in a dome \nshape that is less conical but wide and flat in the central region. Results from all the model \nsimulations for a friction angle of 43.5\u00ba show that aR and aH values lie approximately 55\u00ba from \nthe r-axis, suggesting that the dome partially develops a core region sloping at angles below the \ntalus angle of repose as well as a talus apron at larger radii. Using a lower friction angle for the \ntalus, the results for aR and aH stay relatively close to the z-axis, suggesting that the dome shape \nwill be approximately conical.\nGenerally, for all the simulations, aR and aH increase approximately linearly with respect to \neach other. However, simulations with the highest friction angle of 43.5\u00ba show that aH initially \nincreases with aR ,  but at later times may remain at the same value or slightly decreases for \nincreasing aR . This is because at later times the dome core bulges laterally at mid levels within \nthe dome and not as much near the lower frontal edge or near the summit. The locations of aR\nand aH from the simulations (grey points) can be compared to the observed locations of the \nboundaries between talus and core (red points) for dome profiles between February and May \n2006 and presented by Wadge et al. (In revision, Fig.1). The behaviour is quite similar for some \nsimulation results (Fig. 9 right column). Typically, simulations that use a friction angle equal to \n43.5\u00ba for the talus produce the best fit of aR and aH pairs to the observational data set. Also \nobserve that at later times in the growth of the lava dome the observational data set also shows \nthat aH can decrease or remain the same as aR increases. \nThe point where the talus departs from the angle of repose appears to be a good indicator for \nwhere the talus bounds with the carapace on the dome surface. However, these data may be a \n19\npoor indicator of where the core-talus interface is within the dome interior. As we see from Fig. \n9, the internal shape of the core-talus interface can depart radically for simulations showing quite \nsimilar patterns of aR and aH . At some stages in the growth of the lava dome, the lateral extent \nof the core is three to four times the value of aR bearing no relation to where the extent of the \ncore\/talus interface actually exists on the dome surface. \n4.2.3 Velocity Field\nThe velocity field on day 262 of Simulation 2 is shown in Figure 10. The magnitude of the \nvelocity at the dome surface is largest at distances between 100 and 200 m above the base of the \ndome, due to the boundary condition of no-slip at the base of the dome and the boundary \ncondition of no-stress for the dome surface. Hence, dome core over-riding the talus is clearly \nevident. Since our simulation only considers axisymmetrical endogenous dome growth and \ncannot capture shear lobe channelling, it may be over-estimating the lateral spread of the core \nwithin the dome. However, even if shear lobe growth were considered exclusively in our \nsimulation there is likely to be some amount of lateral spread of any ductile core region that \nexists within the dome due to gravitational spreading. \nNot only does the core override some talus, but over the duration of the simulation the core-talus \nboundary spreads laterally and can also be displaced downwards (Figure 9 and 10). The \ndownwards movement of the core-talus interface may act to compact talus below the core region \nof the dome, increasing stability. Alternatively, if compaction of the talus does not occur, then \nthis overridden talus region could generate a weak region of the dome.\n4.2.4 Core-Talus Interface on 20th May 2006\nAt the end of the growth period, marked by the 20 may collapse, the simulated lava dome free-\nsurface and core-talus interface for the models described in Table 2 are shown in Figure 11. The \nfree-surfaces of the simulated lava domes are all very similar with the largest variation due to the \nchanges in friction angle for Simulations 4 and 5 (Fig. 11a). However the core-talus interfaces\nare be considerably different between simulations (Fig 11b). The Newtonian viscosity model \n(Simulation 8) produces the largest amount of talus between the base of the dome and the core. \nThis is because this viscosity model does not exhibit shear thinning that promotes lateral spread. \n20\nThere is also considerably less lateral spread for the dome cores for Simulations 6 and 7 in which \nthe viscosity is highest in the talus region. The results for the final core-talus interface and dome \nfree-surface shape for all the simulations considered are shown in Figure 11c.\nUsing seismic (RSAM) data Loughlin et al. (In prep) calculated that approximately 9% of the \ndome volume collapsed during a preliminary build-up phase. Following this, the dome collapsed \ncatastrophically and was associated with explosive decompression of the core (Loughlin et al., In \nprep), removing the entire dome, including additional remnants from previous dome growth \nperiods. Like several of the other dome collapse events on SHV, this one was preceded by heavy \nrainfall. The recorded rainfall in central Montserrat was close to the critical level required as \ndefined in Matthews et al.\u2019s (2002) model for rainfall induced collapse and was probably \nsignificantly higher on the volcano (Loughlin et al. In prep). It is likely that rain water was \nchanneled along the talus-crater interface, causing erosion at the margins of the dome next to the \ncrater walls. This idea, coupled with simulation results showing that the core can override the \ntalus, suggests that initial undermining in this way could destabilise a region of core that could \nthen lead to the observed retrogressive collapse and explosions. Assuming that the 9% of dome \nvolume collapsed during this build-up period was derived mainly from the talus (Loughlin et al., \n2006), we can calculate the amount of dome talus required to be removed before penetrating the \ncore. Assuming a conical shape close to the lateral extent of the dome, the volume, V , of dome \nmaterial between a radius CR , and the maximum extent of the dome, TR , is given by;\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\n326\ntan2\n323\nCCTT RRRRV \uf071\uf070 .                                                                 (6)\nWe assume a lava dome with a talus angle of repose, \uf071 , equal to 43.5\u00ba, as appears most suitable \nfor this period of dome growth from our models, and observational data for a maximum radial \nextent for the dome of 475 metres is used. The total lava dome volume prior to collapse was \napproximately 101 million cubic metres, meaning that approximately 9 million cubic metres of \nmaterial was removed during this preliminary build-up phase. Assuming that talus removal only \ntook place to the open east of the dome (say a 120\u00ba section or 1\/3 of the dome, Fig. 1) then talus \n21\nmaterial would need to be removed to a radius CR = 320 metres. Our lava dome simulation \nresults suggest that the core can extend a lateral distance from approximately 220 m to 400 m, \ndepending upon the solidus pressure and viscosity relationship chosen (Fig. 11c). We have no \ndirect observational evidence that such a process exists, however, but these results certainly \nsupport its feasibility.\n4.2.5 Core Volume Fraction\nAt each time-step for the lava dome simulations we save the volumes of the dome, core and \ntalus. Figure 12 shows the time series of core volume fraction for all the simulations considered. \nAt the start of dome growth, the initial core volume fraction is approximately 0.3 for all the \nsimulations. This is because initially talus can develop from all regions of the dome. However, at \nlater times in the simulation, talus only forms primarily near the summit of the dome, meaning \nthe volume fraction of core within the dome can increase to larger values. Also, due to the \nboundary condition of no-slip at the base of the dome, this promotes lateral spread of the core \njust above the base of the dome increasing the core volume fraction only later in the simulation.\nDecreasing the solidus pressure increases the core volume fraction. For Simulation 1 the solidus \npressure is 0.2 M Pa resulting in a final core volume fraction of 0.75, while for Simulation 3 the \nsolidus pressure is 0.6 M Pa resulting in a final core volume fraction of 0.65. Increasing the angle \nof repose for the talus, while maintaining the other parameters constant (Simulations 2, 4 and 5), \nacts to decrease the core volume fraction since a greater volume of talus is required to surround a \ndome with a smaller talus angle of repose.\nThe simulation that uses a Newtonian viscosity relationship (Simulation 7) has a core volume \nfraction growth curve that is significantly different from the simulations using a shear thinning \nviscosity relationship. The final core volume fraction for the Newtonian viscosity relationship is \napproximately 0.6, compared to approximately 0.7 for the shear thinning viscosity relationship \nwith all the other parameters the same. This is due to a greater lateral spread of the core for \nsimulations using a shear-thinning viscosity relationship. The shear thinning viscosity \nrelationship simulations with a higher viscosity in the core, Simulations 6 and 7 have much \nsmaller core volume fraction than for the other simulations, with core volume fraction values \n22\nbetween 0.3 and 0.4. This is similar to the range of dense rock core fraction estimates made by \nWadge et al. (2008) for the same growth period: 0.41 - 0.45. However, because we do not \nconsider a density change between core and talus we may be underestimating the volume of talus \ngenerated. Calculating a final talus volume using the dense rock equivalent ratio 0.86:0.54 for \ncore to talus, the final core volume fraction for the simulated lava domes at a day 292 ranges \nfrom 26 to 66%. \n5.  Discussion\nOur computational lava dome model simulates some of the observed growth characteristics of \nthe August 2005 to May 2006 SHV dome reasonably well. In one sense this is surprising, \nbecause for most of the growth period lava was transported to the surface of the dome via shear \nlobes including both exogenous and endogenous growth, whilst the model simulates growth by \nadding each new batched of lava only into the base of the dome in an endogenous manner. \nExogenous lava dome growth is commonly described as the addition of lava to the central \nsummit region of the dome (e.g. spines) and mass wasting on the flanks. However, at later times \nin our simulations when a considerable volume of talus has accumulated around the lower flanks \nof the dome, our endogenous lava dome model is in many ways similar to conceptual exogenous \nmodels. This is most prominent in the simulations in which a higher viscosity is used for the \ntalus region of the dome with respect to the core, resulting in lava being preferentially channelled \nvertically where the talus or carapace region is thinner (Fig. 9f). Therefore, despite not explicitly \nmodelling the physics associated with exogenous dome growth, our model replicates some of the \nlarge-scale behaviour associated with it.\nOur lava dome model does have a mechanism, based on the angle of the free surface, to simulate \na frictional-controlled talus. The actual mechanism of talus generation: pushing and toppling of \nfracture-bounded blocks of carapace lava onto slopes where gravity aids disaggregation can be \nviewed as a critical-angle problem too. The model raises the possibility of moving the position of \nthe critical-angle instability and disaggregation to quite low on the talus slope because of the \nlateral spread of the core-talus interface (e.g. Fig. 9b). In the context of the axi-symmetric model \nthis would be observed as a band of talus reactivation and perhaps measurable bulging all the \nway around the talus apron. The localised lateral displacement of talus and dome carapace has \n23\nbeen observed but not measured at SHV. This oversteepening of the dome\/talus as it is pushed \nfrom behind by lateral spread of the core is more common at higher extrusion rates and tends to \nbe directed by discrete shear zones (Watts et al., 2002; Loughlin et al., In prep). Directed \nendogenous growth (particularly in the southern part of the dome has caused gross surface \ndeformation (e.g. Watts et al., 2002). At Mount St. Helens there is also evidence of simultaneous \nlocalised endogenous and exogenous dome growth and the lateral displacement of the talus \n(Major et al., In review; Vallance et al., In press). For SHV dome growth is dominated by \nemplacement of shear lobes to the east (i.e. SE-NE), and these may have a significant \nendogenous component. \nFrom observations of the surface position of the carapace\/talus boundary over three episodes of \nlava dome formation at SHV, including the one considered here, Wadge et al. (In review) \nshowed that this evolving boundary may be steep and tends to dip towards the centre of the\ndome. This is a similar geometry to the one simulated here. Wadge et al. (In review) argued that \nthe evidence from the exposed core-talus boundary after the 2003 collapse event was of a steep \nsurface not far from the downward extension of the surface-measured boundary prior to collapse \nand hence that there was probably no more than about 100 m of lateral spreading of the core-\ntalus boundary after burial. Our simulation results tend towards this evolutionary shape when the \ntalus is more viscous and resistive to deformation than the core. However, our model does not \naccount for any inherited material property variability such as from earlier, structurally isolated \nand more rigid parts of the dome which would also tend to inhibit lateral spreading. \nOur work then raises this key question: What is the degree of lateral spreading of core lava in a \nlava dome and how might it be measured? Quantitative 3D survey observations of the core-talus \nboundary revealed by large, but partial collapse would be one way to measure this effect, but \nthere are very few opportunities to do so. Real-time measurement of surface deformation of the \ntalus adjacent to the spreading could be feasible using ground survey instruments such as AVTIS \nor ground-based InSAR (e.g. Casagli et al., 2008). However, a key issue in this regard is whether \nthe rate of readjustment of existing talus and deposition of new talus from above would be \nsufficient to mask any morphological signal. Any upward-directed intrusion producing a \nprotuberance through the carapace should be obvious and measureable. But a deformation of the \n24\ntalus lower down on the dome by lateral expansion of the core may be of smaller amplitude. \nPassive rockfalls (as defined by Calder et al., 2002) forced by the deformation may mask any \nsurrounding topological expression and\/or rockfall from higher up the dome may do likewise. \nThere is another source of observations that is highly relevant to this problem, the rockfalls \nthemselves. The location of rockfalls could shed light on whether deformation of the talus is \nlocalised, as is the case in shear-lobe dominated dome growth, or whether deformation of the \ntalus is uniform, as might be the case for whole-dome endogenous growth. Rockfalls are \nmeasured routinely by the MVO seimometer network, with the frequency character, time, energy \nand duration of each event recorded (Luckett et al., 2002; Calder et al., 2005). These data can be \nused to build up an aggregate budget of events (e.g. Calder et al., 2005; Wadge et al., 2008a). We \nemploy these rockfall data to test against the model in a companion paper (Hale et al. 2009).\nFinally, does it matter whether we know about the disposition of the core\/talus boundary and the \nsize of these domains within siliceous lava domes? It certainly matters from a hazard analysis \nperspective. The more core lava that exists within a dome, in both relative and absolute terms, \nthen the more explosive energy is available, both for large pyroclastic flows following collapse \nand particularly for lateral blast events following very rapid removal of lateral support to the \ndome. Knowledge of the location of the core lava within the dome is also significant for hazard \nassessment purposes. A spreading toe or lobe of core lava over a weak talus substrate may be \nboth relatively unstable and likely to accelerate to more violent activity during the early phases \nof a retrogressive collapse (e.g. Herd et al., 2005). Such weak layers of talus that exist below \nmalleable dome core may be prone to erosion and removal and it could be this mechanism which \npromotes catastrophic failure during heavy rainfall.\nAcknowledgments: We thank the MVO staff who have been responsible for collecting the \nmonitoring data, without which this study would not have been possible, as well as Sarah \nOgburn at University at Buffalo for making Figure 4.

The model domain has an axis of symmetry \nabout r = 0 and this allows us to only model a 2D slice, reducing computing solving time. The \nbase of the domain has the boundary conditions of no-slip (as shown by the fixed triangle \nsymbol), the axis of symmetry at r = 0 permits flow only in the z-direction (shown by the triangle \non rollers), while the boundaries away from r = 0 and z = 0 are open and allow matter to flow \nin\/out of the domain. Magma is introduced into the model domain through a conduit with radius \na. The free-surface of the dome and the core-talus interface are described by level-sets. \nFigure 3: Surveyed cumulative dome volume data (crosses) and best-fit to dome volume with \ntime (continuous line). Also shown on the secondary y-axis is the extrusion rate derived from the \nbest-fit curve for the volume (dashed line), and the extrusion rate interpolated from the surveyed \nvolume-time data (filled circles).\nFigure 4: Slope map for the SHV lava dome during April 2007, derived from the digital \nelevation map of the dome, created by Sarah Ogburn at University at Buffalo. Although this is, a \ndifferent eruptive time period to the one considered in this paper, this slope map is provided \nbecause the dome shape was particularly well-constrained during this period, and shape, and in \nparticular the talus angle of repose is considered typical for other periods. Slope angles are given \nin degrees and are contoured in 10-degree intervals. The majority of the upper slope of the dome \nsits in the range 31-40 degrees, with maximum slopes on the south-eastern side reaching 41-50 \ndegrees. Note that the dome was somewhat flat-topped during this period.\nFigure 5: Simulated lava dome free-surface on 30th March and 7th April 2006 as shown by the \ncontinuous coloured lines as described in Table 3.
