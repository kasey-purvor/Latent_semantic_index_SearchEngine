Substrate electrode temperatures during sputtering were varied from room temperature\nto 450 \u00b0C, the pressure from 0.15 to 6.0 Pa, the nitrogen fraction of the deposition atmosphere from\n10% to 100% and the target bias from \u2212400 to \u22121800 V. The deposition rates as functions of these\nconditions are in the range 0.5\u201325 nm\/min. The growth rate is considered to be controlled\nrespectively by the thermally activated desorption from the substrate, changes in the mean free path\nand concentration of gas particles, differences between the sputter yields of Ga and GaN in Ar and\nN2, and changes in the ion current and sputter yields. The films are generally columnar, with the\ngrain size increasing with film thickness. The most crystalline films were grown at mid range\ntemperatures, low N2 concentrations, and low target biases, and the most disordered were grown at\nlow pressures. The latter two cases suggest that decreasing the energy of particles incident on the\nfilm during deposition results in a more ordered film.

Oxygen\ncontamination of 3\u201330 at. % has a major effect on the optical properties of the films, increasing the\nband gap values from 3.02 to \u00024.0 eV and the Urbach tail energies from around 150 to 840 meV\nand decreasing the refractive index from 2.46 to 2.03. At a 40% N2 deposition fraction, the N:Ga\nratio is more or less constant at 1:1. Since the absolute oxygen incorporation rate changes very little,\nit is the relative film deposition rate which determines the final oxygen concentration.

INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, crystalline GaN and related semiconduc-\ntors have received much attention for short-wavelength op-\ntoelectronic devices and have also found use in a number of\nother applications. Most materials are epitaxially grown on a\nvariety of substrates, typically sapphire or SiC,1 and at high\ntemperatures. This is done by a variety of techniques, includ-\ning chemical-vapor deposition \u0001CVD\u0002, molecular beam epi-\ntaxy \u0001MBE\u0002, and vapor-phase epitaxy \u0001VPE\u0002. Although rf\nsputtering is comparatively inexpensive, there have been few\nreports of epitaxially grown, single crystal GaN using this\nmethod.2,3 This technique has much more often been used to\ngrow polycrystalline and amorphous materials.4\u201311 These\nfilms, using N2 as the reactive gas and Ar or N2 to sputter\na Ga target, are usually grown at low temperatures\n\u0001\u0003450 \u00b0C\u0002. A disordered material grown at low tempera-\ntures using remote-plasma CVD has been shown to have\npotential for lighting and photodiode applications.12,13\nHowever, these studies only investigate the effect of\nchanging one and sometimes two of the major sputter-\ndeposition parameters in a controlled manner. In addition,\nattention is seldom paid to the deposition itself and to the\nlevel of oxygen contamination.\nThe main objective of this experiment is to study how\nthe four main controllable parameters in the given rf sputter-\na\u0002Electronic mail: s.silva@surrey.ac.uk\n0021-8979\/2006\/99\u00027\u0001\/073503\/9\/$23.00 99, 07350\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

EXPERIMENT\nA. Growth\nGaN films were deposited using a Nordiko conventional\nrf reactive sputtering system operating at 13.56 MHz. The\ntarget was 99.9999% pure Ga, contained in a Ni dish on the\nlower driven electrode which was water cooled. The sub-\nstrates were attached to the upper electrode by means of steel\nclips. The substrates used were \u0001001\u0002 Si and fused quartz,\nand these were degreased with organic solvents prior to\ndeposition. The substrate electrode was electrically grounded\nand could be heated to 450 \u00b0C.\nThe growth chamber was fed by Ar and N2 gas lines\n\u000199.9999% purity\u0002, and the flow rates controlled by\n20 SCCM \u0001standard cubic centimeter per minute\u0002 mass-flow\ncontrollers. A quartz shield surrounded the region between\nthe two electrodes containing the plasma. Before each depo-\nsition, the chamber and gas lines were evacuated to a pres-\nsure below 3\u000410\u22124 Pa by a rotary\/diffusion pump combina-\ntion.\nThe influence of varying the substrate electrode tempera-\nture, the deposition pressure, the N2:Ar gas ratio, and the\ntarget self-bias on the properties of the resulting films was\ninvestigated. During a standard deposition, the parameters\n\u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics3-1\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n073503-2 Knox-Davies, Shannon, and Silva J. Appl. Phys. 99, 073503 \u00022006\u0001were kept at room temperature, 2.0 Pa, 8 :12 SCCM \u000140%\nN2\u0002, and \u2212800 V. One parameter was varied at a time, and\nthe changes in the films\u2019 properties were measured. Deposi-\ntion times were adjusted to keep the film thickness close to\n100 nm to allow a better comparison between the various\nproperties. A few thicker films, up to 1 \u0001m, were also grown\nfor comparison.\nB. Measurements\nFilm thicknesses were measured using profilometry and\nellipsometry at a 632.8 nm wavelength. Ellipsometry was\nalso used to obtain values for the refractive index. The sur-\nface was imaged using a Hitachi S4000 scanning electron\nmicroscope \u0001SEM\u0002. The surface topography was analyzed\nusing a Digital Instruments, Dimension 3100 atomic force\nmicroscope \u0001AFM\u0002 operating in the tapping mode. The\ncross-sectional transmission electron microscopy \u0001TEM\u0002 was\ncarried out in a Philips CM200. The relative elemental com-\nposition of the films was measured using energy dispersive\nX-ray \u0001EDX\u0002 spectroscopy on a Philips XL30 SEM. Optical\nabsorption spectra of samples deposited on quartz substrates\nwere measured with a Camspec M300 UV-visible spectro-\nphotometer. The biaxial stress was estimated from profilo-\nmetric measurements of the change in curvature of Si sub-\nstrates utilizing Stoney\u2019s equation. The absorbance spectra of\nthe films were obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the\nsubstrate from the total absorbance. Optical band gaps were\nestimated by extrapolating linear fits to plots of the absorp-\ntion coefficient \u0005 squared versus the photon energy h\u0006 at the\nband edge, the standard method for crystalline, direct band\ngap materials. Urbach tail energies were obtained from the\ninverse of the gradient of ln \u0005 vs h\u0006 at the band tail.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. General\nFilms deposited under standard conditions on quartz\nhave a yellowish tinge. The films become much darker as the\nnitrogen fraction of the deposition gas is reduced to 10% and\nslightly darker when the target bias voltage is increased to\nvery high values. At very low biases, the films appear almost\nclear and glass like. At N2 fractions of 60% and above, the\nfilms on Si tend to delaminate. The Ga target sometimes\nmelts at high rf powers or during long deposition runs, but\nthe deposition rates are not reduced as would be expected as\na result of energy loss in the liquid.14\nB. Deposition rate\nThe deposition rate was calculated by dividing the thick-\nness of the GaN film on Si by the deposition time. These\nvalues are plotted in Fig. 1 as functions of the deposition\nconditions. Profilometric values were used when ellipsom-\netry proved unreliable because of the absorption at the laser\nwavelength or delamination.\n1. Dependence on substrate electrode temperature\nAs the substrate electrode temperature is increased, thedeposition rate remains approximately constant at around\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to3.8 nm\/min until 150 \u00b0C, after which it decreases with tem-\nperature, reaching 1.3 nm\/min at 450 \u00b0C. Factors which\nmay affect the deposition rate include the adsorption and\ndesorption rates of Ga and N atoms and their mobilities on\nthe GaN growth surface, the rate of the Ga+N\u2192GaN reac-\ntion, and the heat radiated to the target surface.\nSince the drop in the deposition rate cannot be attributed\nto the densification of the film, it is concluded that the net\nrate of deposition of both Ga and N atoms is reduced at\nhigher temperatures. One possible explanation is that ada-\ntoms are desorbed more rapidly at higher substrate tempera-\ntures. The rate at which atoms are incorporated into the\ngrowing film is\nRg = \u0001Rinc \u2212 Rref\u0002 \u2212 Rdes \u00011\u0002\n=Rads \u2212 Rdes, \u00012\u0002\nwhere Rinc, Rref, Rdes, and Rads are, respectively, the rates at\nwhich atoms are incident upon, reflected off, desorbed from,\nand adsorbed onto the substrate. The desorption rate from a\nlayer of adsorbed atoms has the form\nRdes = ABe\u2212Ed\/kT, \u00013\u0002\nwhere A is the fraction of the surface occupied by the layer,\nB is a frequency factor for desorption from the layer, and Ed\nis the energy required for an atom in the layer to overcome\nthe surface forces.15 If it is assumed that the adsorption rate\nand the adatom coverage of the substrate do not change sub-\nstantially with temperature, the \u0001atomic\u0002 deposition rate can\nbe written as\nRg = r0\u00011 \u2212 d0e\u2212Ed\/kT\u0002 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere r0 is the deposition rate at low temperatures and d0\n=AB \/r0.\nSince the density is essentially constant with the tem-\nperature, the spatial deposition rate should also take this\nform. Fitting Eq. \u00014\u0002 to the data of Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002 gives values of\nr0=3.85 nm\/min, d0=20.4, and Ed=0.22 eV.\nThis fit suggests that the deposition rate should drop to\nzero above about 550 \u00b0C, but this is unlikely to occur since\nthe surface coverage term A should be reduced for very high\nFIG. 1.

If the value of Ed is compared with values\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n073503-3 Knox-Davies, Shannon, and Silva J. Appl. Phys. 99, 073503 \u00022006\u0001in the literature, Al adatoms on NaCl and mica have adsorp-\ntion energies of 0.6 and 0.9 eV, respectively.16 The values for\nGa may be comparable because it is chemically similar and\nhas a slightly lower bulk binding energy. However, the few\nvalues for Ga adsorbed onto GaN reported in the literature\nare considerably higher. Guha et al.17 reported a measured Ed\nvalue of 2.2\u00b10.2 eV for less than one monolayer of Ga ad-\nsorbed onto a GaN \u0001001\u0002 surface. Adelmann et al.18 calcu-\nlated from first principles that the adatom binding energies\nfor single atoms and adatom islands on top of an adsorbed\nGa bilayer were 2.52 and 2.41 eV, respectively. It is not\npossible to connect the Ed value extracted in the present\nstudy with other activation energies in the system, such as\nthe cohesive energy of bulk Ga \u00032.8 eV \u0001Ref. 19\u0002\u0004 or the\nactivation energy for the evaporation of GaN \u00033.6 eV \u0001Ref.\n20\u0002\u0004. One possibility, which has been overlooked, is that the\ntemperature of the growth face, where adsorption\/desorption\noccurs, may be substantially higher than the temperature of\nthe substrate electrode or the substrate itself. This would ef-\nfectively shift the plot of Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002 to higher temperatures and\nthus increase the value of Ed considerably.\n2. Pressure dependence\nAs the deposition pressure is increased \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004, the\ndeposition rate increases from 3.1 nm\/min at 0.15 Pa,\nreaches a broad maximum of about 3.9 nm\/min in the range\n0.5\u20132.0 Pa, and then decreases again to 2.4 nm\/min at\n6.0 Pa. The pressure dependence of the deposition rate is\nlikely to be a result of two competing processes. As the pres-\nsure is increased, there are more and more gas atoms\/\nmolecules available for ionization which should increase the\nnumber of ions attracted to the target and thus increase the\ndeposition rate. However, at the same time, the mean free\npath of electrons in the plasma is reduced, lowering the av-\nerage electron energy. This serves to reduce the probability\nof an atom being ionized by a collision, and thus the number\nof ions available for sputtering. The reduced mean free path\nalso applies to the sputtered Ga species which means that\nless of the sputtered material reaches the substrate. The mean\nfree path of unionized gas particles at 25 \u00b0C and 1.0 Pa is\n7 mm, and the total target-substrate distance is around\n50 mm. For these reasons, the deposition rate is maximized\nnear 1 Pa.\n3. Nitrogen fraction dependence\nThe deposition rate decreases approximately linearly\nwith increasing N2 fraction, from around 5.9 nm\/min at 10%\nN2 to around 2.1 nm\/min at 65% N2 \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004. Thereafter,\nit decreases more slowly but also linearly to around\n1.5 nm\/min at 100% N2. Dependencies of the deposition\nrate versus the reactive gas fraction showing an initial rapid\ndecrease followed by a more gradual one have been observed\nin other material systems such as TaN,21 TiN,22 RuO2,23 and\nCrN\/Cr2N.24 The rapid drop is usually ascribed to the for-\nmation of a layer of compound on the target. For sputtered\nGaN films, Ross and Rubin25 observed an almost identical\ndependence to this experiment at 1.22 Pa, including a knee\n6in the data at 65% N2. Lakshmi et al. also observed a simi-\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tolar dependence with a few data points and concluded that it\nwas Ar which was mainly responsible for sputtering.\nHeller26 has modeled the effect on the sputtering rate of\nthe surface oxide formation on the target under the assump-\ntion that the sputter yields of the reactive and sputtering\ngases are identical. At low partial pressures of the reactive\ngas, the target surface is clean and the sputtering rate is high\n\u0001that of the metal in the sputtering gas\u0002. At a critical partial\npressure P*, which is a function of the particular sputtering\nsystem, total pressure, and rf power, a layer of compound\nforms on the target, dramatically reducing the sputtering rate\nbecause of the lower sputter yield. Hereafter, the deposition\nrate decays slowly to a limiting value which is that of a\ncompound target.\nAccording to this model there are two possibilities which\ndepend on the precise forms of curves describing the reaction\nrate at the target surface and the sputtering rate, both as a\nfunction of compound thickness. They both start off with a\nGa sputtering rate independent of the partial pressure of the\nreactive gas until a critical pressure at which the sputter rate\nequals the reaction rate and a compound forms on the target\nsurface. Hereafter, the sputtering rate decreases slowly in an\nexponential like manner \u0001type 1\u0002 or very rapidly \u0001type 2\u0002 to\nthe rate at which the nitride is sputtered.\nSince the sputter yield changes with the sputtering ion,\nthe sputtering rate of Ga in N2 will be different from that in\nAr. In addition, if GaN forms on the target, sputter yields in\nAr and N2 will once again be different. Thus, there are four\ndifferent sputtering rates, namely, those of Ga in Ar, Ga in\nN2, GaN in Ar, and GaN in N2, denoted as RGa:Ar, RGa:N2,\nRGaN:Ar, and RGaN:N2, respectively. If it is assumed that the\nprocess taking place here is of type 2, with the decrease in\nsputtering rate approximating a step change, the deposition\nrate can be written as\nRdep = \u0003xRGa:N2 + \u00011 \u2212 x\u0002RGa:Ar\u0004u\u0001x0 \u2212 x\u0002\n+ \u0003xRGaN:N2 + \u00011 \u2212 x\u0002RGaN:Ar\u0004u\u0001x \u2212 x0\u0002 , \u00015\u0002\nwhere x is the fraction of N2 in the sputtering gas, u\u0001x\u0002 is the\nHeaviside function, and x0 is the nitrogen fraction at which\nthe step change occurs. This fit to the data of Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002 pro-\nduces values of RGa:Ar=6.5, RGa:N2 =\u22120.3, RGaN:Ar=3.3, and\nRGaN:N2 =1.5 nm\/min, and x0=0.64. The value for RGa:N2 is\nobviously incorrect, but it could be due to a change in the\nefficiency of ion formation, with increasing N2 concentration\naffecting the slope of the first section of the curve. However,\nit does emphasize the dominance of Ga sputtering in Ar,\nwhen compared with Ga sputter rates in N2. It is also suspi-\ncious that RGa:N2\u0007RGaN:N2. However, RGa:Ar\u0002RGaN:Ar and\nRGaN:Ar\u0002RGaN:N2, as expected. It has not been possible to\nfind relative values of the sputter yields in the literature with\nwhich to compare these values.\nAnother possibility is that the curve is actually of type 1,\nbut with x0 shifted to very low N2 concentrations and having\nan exponentiallike dependence, but this function cannot be\nexpressed analytically for fitting.\nThe model of Hrbek,27 based on a reduction in sputtering\nrate as a result of increased adsorption \u0001but not reaction\u0002 of\nthe reactive gas at the target surface, provides a poor fit to\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n073503-4 Knox-Davies, Shannon, and Silva J.

In addition, a scum \u0001presumably GaN\u0002 was often\nobserved on the target when depositing at low sputter rates.\nHowever, this effect would increase the gradient of the low\nN2 fraction part of the observed curve, which could explain\nthe erroneous values of the earlier fit.\n4. Target bias dependence\nThe deposition rate increases roughly quadratically with\nthe target bias voltage from about 0.47 nm\/min at \u2212400 V to\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject tothat the system used here is comparable to the dc sputtering\nprocess and that the ion sheath is predominantly collision-\nfree, the Child-Langmuir law gives the ion current incident\non the Ga target as proportional to V3\/2, where V, the voltage\nacross the sheath, is taken to be approximately the same as\nthe target bias voltage.14 The sputter yield as a function of\nion energy can be divided into three regions.28 The first, from\nthe threshold to 100 eV, where there is a poor experimental\nreproducibility, will not be discussed. In the second, from\n100 to 600 eV, the yield is approximately proportional to V,\nand in the third region, above 600 eV, it drops to V1\/2. If the\ndependencies of the ion current and the sputter yield are\ncombined, the rates at which the material is removed from\nthe target in the latter two regions are then proportional to\nV5\/2 and V2, respectively. Since both of these fit well to the\nexperimental data, the film growth rate is assumed to be\ncontrolled primarily by the rate at which Ga is sputtered.\nC. Crystal structure\nThe AFM phase and SEM images of selected 1 \u0001m\nsamples on Si are shown in Fig. 2 at the same magnification.\nThe phase images were found to be especially useful for\nshowing grain boundaries. The surface roughness and area\ncalculated from the AFM amplitude plots are given in Table\nI. For the sample deposited at \u2212600 V, crystallites are well\ndefined and protrude from the substrate. The grain sizes are\nas large as 250 nm in diameter. At \u2212800 V, the crystallites\nare smaller and more variable in size, and at \u22121200 V, the\nsample is very flat and the crystallites uniformly small. The\nrms roughness decreases from 9.3 nm for the \u2212600 V sample\nto 2.8 nm for the \u22121200 V sample. This trend towards a\nreduction in the crystallite size and surface roughness is mir-\nrored in 100 nm samples deposited every 200 V between\n\u2212400 and \u22121400 V. However, the surface features are much\nsmaller than for the 1 \u0001m samples. Films may be more crys-\ntalline at low deposition biases because the deposition rates\nand the energies of most particles in the system are lower.\nThus, adatoms can move about the surface for a longer time\nwithout being covered by incoming atoms, and there should\nbe less damage to the growing crystallites by incoming par-\nticles.\nThe 1 \u0001m sample deposited at 200 \u00b0C shows similar\ngrain sizes to those of the room-temperature deposited\nsample, but there are what appear to be many fissures on the\nsurface of each grain. SEM images of 100 nm films at 18,\n150, 300, and 450 \u00b0C appear to show a grain size increase as\na function of temperature, but films are smoother than those\nTABLE I.

At higher N2 concentrations \u000160%,\n80%, and 100%\u0002, the 100 nm film surface becomes increas-\ningly featureless.\nAlthough it was not possible to grow a 1 \u0001m sample at\n0.5 Pa because the sample delaminated completely during\ndeposition, images of 100 nm samples deposited at 0.15 and\n0.5 Pa show a surface too smooth to image properly. The\ngreater mean free path of atoms at lower pressures means\nthat particles hit the substrate with increased energy, possibly\nproducing an increasingly stressed and disordered film. A\n100 nm sample deposited at 6.0 Pa shows essentially the\nsame surface morphology as that of the 2.0 Pa sample.\nCross-sectional TEM characterization showed that in\nmost cases, the crystallites are columnar in shape, with the\ncolumn width increasing towards the top surface of the film.\nThis is in agreement with the trend observed using SEM. The\npresence of many spots forming discontinuous rings on the\nselected area diffraction \u0001SAD\u0002 patterns showed that the\nfilms are polycrystalline although the degree of crystallinity\ndiffers. The relative spacing of the rings show that the mate-\nrial is predominantly wurtzite GaN.\nThe TEM samples exhibiting the greatest crystallinity\nare 1 \u0001m thick, deposited at 20% N2 and 200 \u00b0C. They have\nlarge, clear grains which start right at the substrate-sample\ninterface and reach up to 60 and 100 nm in diameter at the\ntop surface. This value for the 200 \u00b0C samples is smaller\nthan that shown by the AFM phase image. The discrepancy\nmay either be a result of the way in which the sample has\nbeen sectioned or it may mean that what appear to be single\ncrystallites in the AFM image are, in fact, groups of crystal-\nlites. The SAD patterns close to the surface of the 20% N2\nfilm show an array of clear spots, which suggests that there\nare only a few large crystallites in the region of observation.\nFor the 200 \u00b0C sample, the SAD pattern shows bright con-\ntinuous arcs which may indicate a gradual change in orien-\ntation within a crystallite or a range of crystallite orientations\nabout a preferred orientation.

Chemical composition\nThe elemental composition of samples was obtained us-\ning EDX. For this analysis, the SEM accelerating voltage\nwas lowered to 4 kV for the 100 nm samples to reduce the\nelectron penetration depth such that the X-ray peak from the\nSi substrate was all but invisible. Thicker samples were mea-\nsured at 10 kV. A calibration to prevent under-reporting\nof O and N concentrations was carried out on sapphire\nand high quality, metal-organic chemical-vapor deposition\n\u0001MOCVD\u0002-grown GaN.\nThe quartz shield surrounding the plasma was found to\nbe essential in reducing the oxygen contamination of the\nfilms. Under standard deposition conditions, the O content of\n500 nm thick films increased on removal of the shield from\n3 to 26 at. %, irrespective of whether the target was presput-\ntered. A possible reason is that the plasma is not contained\nwithout the shield, filling the entire deposition chamber.\nThus, a contact with the plasma may release a steady supply\nof adsorbed gases such as water and oxygen, which are\nreadily incorporated into the growing film. The relative\natomic percentages of Ga, N, and O in the samples are plot-\nted in Fig. 4. As a function of the substrate electrode tem-\nperature, the oxygen content increases monotonically from\n3.2 at. % at room temperature to 9.7% at 375 \u00b0C and 20.3%\nat 450 \u00b0C. The ratio of Ga:N is essentially constant at around\n1:1. As a function of pressure, there is a region in the range\n0.25\u20132.0 Pa, where the O contamination changes only\nslightly from 2.8% to 3.3%. At lower and higher pressures,\nthe O content increases. At 0.15 Pa, it is 4.4%, and at 4.0 and\n6.0 Pa, 8.2% and 10.8%, respectively. As a function of the\nN2 flow rate, the O concentration increases at both low and\nhigh flow rates. As the N2 flow rate is increased, the O con-\ncentration in the film changes rapidly from 18.2 at. % at 10%\nFIG. 4.

The high Ga con-\ncentration at low N2 flow rates has often been measured or\ninferred in the literature.5,6,25\nThe most dramatic change in the level of oxygen con-\ntamination is as a function of the target bias. At \u2212400 V, this\nis about 30 at. % but decreases rapidly to around 3.2% at\n\u2212800 V, after which it decreases very slightly to 2.6% at\n\u22121400 V. The N\/Ga ratio is fairly constant, except at low\nbiases where it decreases from 0.98 at \u2212800 V to 0.82 at\n\u2212400 V.\nIf the nitrogen in sections of the film were replaced with\noxygen so as to form Ga2O3, it would do so such that the\nrelationship between the Ga, N, and O atomic percentages\nwould be d\u0001Gaat. %\u2212Nat. %\u0002 \/dOat. %=2\/3. However, this is\nnot observed for these films. At high temperatures, there is\nno change in the Ga:N ratio and at high pressures, perhaps\neven a slight increase in the concentration of nitrogen rela-\ntive to gallium. At low target biases, there is a slight reduc-\ntion in the Ga:N ratio, but the change is only about 1 \/3 of\nthe expected value. Thus, O does not simply replace N, nor is\nit incorporated as Ga2O3.\nIf it is assumed that the atomic density \u0001atoms\/nm3\u0002 is\napproximately constant under all the deposition conditions, it\nis possible to obtain a sort of elemental deposition rate for\neach constituent element by multiplying the spatial deposi-\ntion rate by the relative atomic fraction of the film. This\nallows the rate at which each individual element is incorpo-\nrated into the growing film to be determined. The elemental\ndeposition rates for Ga, N, and O are plotted in Fig. 5.\nAs a function of temperature, the O deposition rate in-\ncreases from 0.12 to 0.26 nm\/min, while the Ga and N rates\ndecrease from 1.9 to 0.5 nm\/min. This suggests that the in-\ncreased O concentration at elevated temperatures is partially\na result of the low Ga and N deposition rates which would\nFIG. 5.

Redistribution subject toincreased relative concentration in the deposited film. The\nincreased absolute O incorporation rate is thought to be\ncaused by an accelerated desorption of O2 and H2O off parts\nof the deposition chamber adjacent to the heater.\nThe O deposition rate is essentially constant at\n0.12 nm\/min for deposition pressures from 0.15\u20132.0 Pa, but\njumps to around 0.27 nm\/min for depositions at 4.0 and\n6.0 Pa. At these higher pressures, a significant amount of\narcing takes place between the target and the earth shield,\npossibly releasing additional H2O and O2 because of local\nheating. A reduction in the amount of available atomic N\nmight increase the O incorporation, but this is unlikely be-\ncause the N\/Ga ratio increases slightly at higher pressures.\nThus, the O incorporation rate is essentially constant where\nthere is no arcing, and the reduction in the Ga deposition rate\nat high and low pressures increases the O contamination of\nthe films. It appears that the increased energy of sputtered\natoms reaching the substrate at lower pressures \u0001because of\nfewer collisions\u0002 does not have the effect of removing ad-\nsorbed O atoms, as was thought to occur by Zembutsu and\nKobayashi,7 where a negative substrate bias reduced the\namount of O incorporation because of ion bombardment.\nAs the N2 fraction in the deposition atmosphere is in-\ncreased from 10% to 100%, the O concentration initially\ndecreases from 18.2 at. % at 10% N2 to 3.2 at. % at 40% N2.\nIn the same range, the N concentration increases from\n33.1 to 47.8 at. %. The relationship between the Ga, N, and\nO atomic percentages in this region is d\u0001Gaat. %\u2013Nat. %\u0002 \/\ndOat. %=0.95. Thus, it appears that the missing N atoms are\nreplaced by O atoms. The O incorporation rate is decreased\nfrom 1.07 nm\/min at 10% N2 to 0.12 nm\/min at 40% N2.\nThis high incorporation rate at low N2 ratios is ascribed to\ngettering of the available O in the deposition atmosphere in\nthe absence of sufficient atomic N. At higher N2 concentra-\ntions, the O concentration increases slowly, reaching around\n7 at. % at 100% N2, but since the O incorporation rate is\nfairly constant in this region, it is likely that this increase is\ndue to the decreased deposition rate.\nAs a function of the target bias voltage, the increase in\nthe Ga and N deposition rate is more than ten times that of\nthe O deposition rate. From \u2212400 to \u2212800 V, the absolute O\nincorporation rate is more or less constant, after which it\nincreases slowly up to \u22121400 V. This is interpreted to mean\nthat at medium to low target bias, the increase in relative O\ncontamination with a reduction in bias voltage is due to the\nreduction in Ga and N deposition rates and a constant O\nincorporation rate. At higher bias, the relative oxygen con-\ntamination continues to decrease, but this is only because the\nabsolute Ga and N incorporation rates increase at a much\ngreater rate than the absolute O incorporation rate. The in-\ncrease in the absolute O incorporation rate is ascribed to the\nincreased energy of the plasma increasing desorption from\nthe chamber walls.\nThe trends in the O\/N ratio measured using electron-\nenergy-loss spectroscopy \u0001EELS\u0002 in the TEM agree with the\ntrends reported here using EDX in the SEM.

Phys. 99, 073503 \u00022006\u0001where the H concentration was also measured,31 the H and O\ncontamination levels were almost the same at 16 and\n15 at. %, respectively. Although the source of H was as-\ncribed to the contamination of the source gases, it is specu-\nlated that it could be due to the desorption of H2O off the\nchamber walls.\nE. Biaxial stress\nThe biaxial stress was measured in an earlier experi-\nment, and as a function of the target bias and deposition\nnitrogen fraction, where the pressure was 1.85 Pa, the N2\nfraction is 33%, and the top electrode is floating. The values\nof the compressive biaxial stress are plotted in Fig. 6. There\nappears to be a fairly linear increase in biaxial stress from\n1.2 GPa at 33% N2 to 4.7 GPa at 75% N2. This increase may\nbe responsible for the delamination of films deposited at 60%\nN2 and above. As the target bias is increased, the stress also\nincreases from around 0.1 GPa at \u2212400 V to 3.2 GPa at\n\u22121025 V. The reason for this may be the increased energy of\nsputtered atoms at higher target biases impacting on the\ngrowing film, or it may be because at the high deposition\nrates, there is insufficient time for incoming atoms to take up\noptimal positions in the film before they are covered with\nmore materials. No delamination was observed at high biases\nfor 100 nm films, possibly because the increased energy of\nparticles hitting the target causes some substrate-film mixing\nor relaxation at high fluxes. In the current experiment, it is\nalso thought that films deposited at low pressures have an\nincreased biaxial stress because the larger mean free path\nmeans that particles have higher energies. When a 1 \u0001m\nthick film was grown at 0.5 Pa, the film delaminated during\ndeposition, whereas the others, at high N2 flow rates, usually\ndelaminated slowly afterwards.\nF. Optical properties\n1. General\nFairly typical absorption spectra of films deposited at\ndifferent temperatures are plotted in Fig. 7\u0001a\u0002 and the absorp-\ntion coefficient squared in 7\u0001b\u0002. At low photon energies, up\nto around 2.4\u20133.4 eV, the dominant feature is interference\nbecause of internal reflections within the films. The funda-\nmental absorption at the band edge takes place at higher\nphoton energies for the samples deposited at the higher tem-\nperatures. The increased O concentration shown by EDX\nmay be responsible since the band gap of \b-Ga2O3 is in the\n32\u201334\nFIG. 6.

Redistribution subject toThe curves of Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002 are remarkably similar to those ob-\nserved by Butcher et al.35 for an increased O contamination\nin GaN deposited by remote-plasma enhanced CVD. For the\ncurrent experiment, plots for decreasing target bias voltages,\nwhich have increasing O contamination levels, exhibit the\nsame trend. This adds weight to the view that O contamina-\ntion has a major effect on the optical absorption spectrum\nclose to the band edge.\n2. Band gaps\nThe optical band gaps are plotted versus the deposition\nparameters in Fig. 8. As a function of the substrate electrode\ntemperature, the band gaps increase from 3.02 eV at room\ntemperature to 3.60 eV at 450 \u00b0C. The rate of change is low\nto around 200 \u00b0C and increases thereafter. The increase is\nprimarily ascribed to a shift of absorption to higher photon\nenergies because of an increase in the O content of the films.\nSome of the initial increase may be partially due to the im-\nproved crystallinity and reduced band tailing because of the\nincreased thermal energy allowing Ga and N atoms to mi-\ngrate over the surface during growth and take up more opti-\nmal positions in the growing film.\nAs a function of the N2 fraction, the band gap initially\nincreases very rapidly from 2.49 eV at 10% N2 to a plateau\nabove 25% N2 at around 3.07 eV and then increases again\nabove 70% N2. The initial band gap increase corresponds to\na visible change from dark brown or black to a slightly yel-\nlowish color in transmission. In view of the EDX results, this\nis ascribed to a reduction in the amount of excess Ga in the\nFIG. 7. Total absorbance of the film and substrate \u0001a\u0002 and absorption coef-\nficient squared \u0001b\u0002 at various substrate electrode deposition temperatures.FIG. 8.

However, in this region, N atoms seem to be replaced\nby O atoms, but there may not be enough oxygen present to\nreact with all the Ga. It is not clear what is responsible for\nthe band gap increase at higher N2 fractions.\nThe correlation between the optical band gap value and\nthe level of O contamination is most clearly demonstrated as\na function of the target bias. The band gap values are very\nhigh at low target biases, reaching more than 4.00 eV at\n\u2212400 V, but are essentially constant at around 3.03 eV for\n\u2212600 V and above.\n3. Urbach tail energy\nFilms which are thick enough for color in transmission\nto be determined by the absorption of the films rather than by\ninterference are yellowish, except where there is a significant\nO contamination. This absorption is visible below the band\nedge as band tailing into the blue part of the spectrum.\nThe Urbach tail energy E0, which is often used to quan-\ntify the band tailing and thus the disorder in the material, is\nplotted in Fig. 9. As a function of the substrate electrode\ntemperature, the value varies around 150 meV up to 300 \u00b0C,\npossibly decreasing slightly, before increasing rapidly to\n470 meV at 375 \u00b0C and to 840 meV at 450 \u00b0C. Slack\net al.36 have suggested that the Urbach tail could be caused\nby O impurities. Figure 7\u0001a\u0002 shows how the spectral features\nof films deposited at higher temperatures and O content tend\nto be smeared out.\nAt low N2 flow rates, the values are large and are likely\nto be a result of excess Ga, giving rise to significant absorp-\ntion right into the band gap. There appears to be a shallow\nminimum at around 40% N2, after which the values increase\nagain at higher N2 flow rates. The increase may be related to\nthe decrease in Ga and to the increase in O. A plot of E0\nversus the negative target bias voltage also shows a mini-\nmum in the range of \u2212600 to \u2212800 V. Above \u22121400 V, the\nvalues decrease again. The large values at low target biases\nmay once again be related to the smearing of the band edge\nby O contamination. However, the minimum may reflect an\nimproved crystallization due to the low target bias, but with-\nFIG. 9. Urbach tail energies for 100 nm films.out the gross O contamination of the very low biases.\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject toIn regions with more than 5% O contamination, the band\ngap exhibits similar trends to those of the Urbach tail energy.\nThe only exception to this is at low N2 flow rates where the\nfilms are Ga rich and the increased oxygenation is only as a\nresponse to the decrease in the availability of nitrogen. Be-\ncause of the way in which the band gaps are inferred from\nthe optical absorption curves, a decrease in the Urbach tail\nenergy should be accompanied by an increase in the band\ngap because a reduction in tail states should sharpen the band\nedge. Thus, large values of E0 can mostly be ascribed to an\nexcess of oxygen rather than to any real trend in terms of\nimprovement in the crystal structure. The minima in the plots\nof E0 as functions of the N2 flow rate and target bias voltage\ncoincide with the standard deposition conditions. This may\nindicate that these conditions are close to optimal for the\ngiven setup.\n4. Refractive index\nThe trends in the refractive indices are essentially oppo-\nsite to those of the optical band gaps. This is expected be-\ncause of the Kramers-Kronig relationship between the wave-\nlength dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the\nrefractive index, n and k. Films having a large O content\nshow very low values of refractive index, and the measure-\nment seems to be a fairly sensitive indicator of this. The\nrefractive index of the disordered \b-Ga2O3 is 1.89 at\n632.8 nm.32 Under standard deposition conditions, the re-\nfractive index of the GaN is 2.46, just short of the highest\nreliable value of 2.47 at 75 \u00b0C. The lowest values were ob-\ntained at 450 \u00b0C \u00012.03\u0002, 90% N2 \u00012.23\u0002, and \u2212400 V \u00011.73\u2013\n2.04\u0002. For the severely oxygenated samples deposited with-\nout the quartz shield, refractive index values were in the\nrange 1.91\u20132.03 for 30%\u201370% N2 and only reached 2.2 at a\ntarget bias of \u22121400 V.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe deposition rates of GaN films formed by reactive\nsputtering vary over a wide range, from 0.47 to 25 nm\/min,\ndepending on the deposition conditions. As a function of\ntemperature, pressure, N2 fraction, and target bias, the depo-\nsition rates are considered to be controlled, respectively, by\nthermally activated desorption from the substrate, changes in\nthe mean free path and concentration of gas particles, differ-\nences between the sputter yields of Ga and GaN in Ar and\nN2, and changes in the ion current and sputter yields.\nThe films are polycrystalline and generally columnar,\nwith the grain size increasing with film thickness. The most\ncrystalline films were grown at midrange temperatures, low\nN2 concentrations, and low target biases, and the most dis-\nordered at low pressures. The latter two cases suggest that\ndecreasing the energy of particles incident on the film during\ndeposition results in a more ordered film. The biaxial stress\nis compressive and shows an increasing trend with the N2\nconcentration and target bias.\nThe stoichiometry, the oxygen contamination in particu-\nlar, has a major effect on the optical properties of the films,\nmasking any effect of the degree of the structural disorder.\nOxygen contamination tends to smear out the band edges and\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n073503-9 Knox-Davies, Shannon, and Silva J.

Except as a function of N2 in the deposition atmo-\nsphere, the N\/Ga ratio is more or less constant. The absolute\noxygen incorporation rate changes very little, but it is the\nrelative film deposition rate which determines the final oxy-\ngen concentration. At low N2 concentrations, Ga getters oxy-\ngen from the deposition atmosphere in the absence of suffi-\ncient atomic nitrogen. The excess Ga makes the films opaque\nto the naked eye, and this is reflected as a decrease in the\nband gaps and an increase in the Urbach tail energy.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank S.
