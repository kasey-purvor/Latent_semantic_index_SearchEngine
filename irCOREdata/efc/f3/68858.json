Fal\u2019ko\nDepartment of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YB, United Kingdom\nWe consider the effective mass model of spinless electrons in single wall carbon nanotubes that\nis equivalent to the Dirac equation for massless fermions. Within this framework we derive all\npossible energy independent hard wall boundary conditions that are applicable to metallic tubes.\nThe boundary conditions are classified in terms of their symmetry properties and we demonstrate\nthat the use of different boundary conditions will result in varying degrees of valley degeneracy\nbreaking of the single particle energy spectrum.\nINTRODUCTION\nCarbon nanotubes are the subject of intense research,\nmotivated by the desire to use their unique physical and\nelectronic properties in the development of nanoscale\nelectrical devices[1, 2]. The electronic properties of nan-\notubes follow from the band structure of graphene - a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) sheet of graphite - which is a semi-\nmetal, having a vanishing energy gap at the six corners,\nK-points, of the hexagonal first Brillouin zone. A single-\nwall nanotube may be thought of as a graphene sheet\nrolled up to form a nanometre-diameter cylinder. Period-\nicity around the circumference results in quantized trans-\nverse wavevectors leading to metallic or semiconducting\nbehaviour depending on whether the K-point wavevector\nK is an allowed wavevector.\nWhile the energy spectrum of an infinitely long tube\nwill be continuous, a finite tube should possess discrete\nenergy levels corresponding to standing waves typical of\na confined quantum particle. Evidence of discrete levels\nwas seen in transport measurements [3, 4] a few years ago,\nfollowed by the direct observation of sinusoidal standing\nwave patterns by scanning tunneling microscopy[5, 6].\nThe measured wavelength of the standing waves \u03bb \u223c\n0.75nm, about three times larger than the lattice con-\nstant a \u2248 0.25nm, corresponded to wavevectors near the\nK-point K. More recently, Coulomb blockade measure-\nments on carbon nanotube quantum dots [7, 8, 9] have\nfound evidence for fourfold periodicity of the spectra that\nis in agreement with expectations based on spin and K-\npoint degeneracy, although the experiments appeared to\nshow varying degrees of degeneracy breaking. A number\nof authors [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have modelled finite-length\nnanotubes in order to describe the atomic scale varia-\ntion of standing waves patterns and the opening of an\nenergy gap displaying an oscillating dependence on the\ntube length. Rather than concentrating on one partic-\nular model of a boundary, we aim to describe all pos-\nsible energy independent hard wall boundary conditions\nfor metallic single wall nanotubes. We will classify the\nboundary conditions in terms of their symmetry proper-\nties and show how different boundary conditions produce\nvarying degrees of K-point degeneracy breaking.\nIn the scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of\nRef. 6 an additional slow spatial modulation of the stand-\ning waves was observed. It was interpreted as being a\nbeating envelope function with wavevector q, |q| \u226a |K|,\nresulting from the interference of left and right moving\nwaves with slightly different total wavevectors K \u00b1 q.\nTheoretically, the effective mass model [15, 16, 17, 18]\nprovides a reliable analytical description of the electronic\nstructure near the K point where the total wavevector is\nk = K+q and the dispersion relation is linear E = sv |q|,\nv is the Fermi velocity and s = \u00b11 for the conduction and\nvalence band, respectively. For spinless electrons, the en-\nvelope wavefunction \u03a8 (q, r) has four components corre-\nsponding to two inequivalent atomic sites in the hexago-\nnal graphite lattice (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d) and to two inequiva-\nlent K-points in the hexagonal first Brillouin zone. The\nresulting eigenvalue equation for \u03a8 is the massless Dirac\nequation,\n\u2212 iv\u03b1.\u2207\u03a8 = E\u03a8; \u03b1 =\n(\n\u03c3 0\n0 \u2212\u03c3\n)\n; (1)\n\u03c3 = ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2 (\u03c3x \u0131\u02c6+ \u03c3y \uf6be\u02c6) e\n\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2\nwhere the role of spin (\u201cpseudo-spin\u201d) is assumed by the\nrelative amplitudes on the A and B atomic sites: \u03c3 is a\nvector in the (x, y) plane rotated by the chiral angle \u03b7\nof the tube. Also, v =\n(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b3 is the Fermi velocity,\na is the lattice constant of graphite and \u03b3 is the nearest\nneighbour transfer integral.\nIn this paper we consider the effective boundary con-\nditions for the envelope function \u03a8 in a finite size carbon\nnanotube. Since the effective mass model for \u03a8 corre-\nsponds to the Dirac equation, we begin by deriving all\npossible energy independent hard wall boundary condi-\ntions for the Dirac equation. We write them in terms of\na small number of arbitrary parameters, mixing angles,\nthat describe mixing between boundary conditions with\ndifferent discrete symmetries. Then, in order to illustrate\nthe meaning of the general boundary conditions, we eval-\nuate the resulting energy level spectra for non-interacting\nelectrons in finite-length metallic nanotubes and the cor-\nresponding standing wave envelope functions. To antici-\npate a little, we find that energy independent hard wall\n2boundary conditions for the Dirac equation may be ex-\npressed in general terms as\n\u03a8 = M\u03a8; M2 = 1; {nB.\u03b1,M} = 0, (2)\nwhere M is an Hermitian, unitary 4\u00d7 4 matrix M2 = 1\nwith the constraint that it anticommutes with the oper-\nator nB.\u03b1, proportional to the component of the current\noperator normal to the interface, nB is the unit vector\nnormal to the interface. As explained in the Appendix,\nwe find four possible linear combinations of matrices sat-\nisfying these constraints on M , which, assuming nB is\na vector confined to the (x, y) plane, may be written in\nterms of a small number of arbitrary parameters:\nM1 = cos\u039b (I\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3) + sin\u039b (\u03a0z \u2297 n2.\u03c3) , (3)\nM2 = cos\u03a5 (\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3) + sin\u03a5 (\u03bd2.\u03a0\u2297 nB.\u03c3) , (4)\nM3 = cos\u2126 (\u03bd2.\u03a0\u2297 nB.\u03c3) + sin\u2126 (I\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3) , (5)\nM4 = cos\u0398 (\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3) + sin\u0398 (\u03a0z \u2297 n2.\u03c3) , (6)\nwhere the angles \u039b,\u03a5,\u0398 and \u2126 are arbitrary, n1 and\nn2 are three-dimensional space-like vectors satisfying the\ncontraints n1.nB = n2.nB = n1.n2 = 0, and \u03bd1 and \u03bd2\nare two-dimensional (confined to the (x, y) plane) space-\nlike vectors satisfying the constraint \u03bd1.\u03bd2 = 0. Here we\nhave adopted a matrix direct product notation to high-\nlight the separate K-point space and AB space structure,\nusing the notation {\u03c3x, \u03c3y, \u03c3z, I\u03c3} for 2\u00d7 2 Pauli matri-\nces and the unit matrix that operate within a block (\u2018AB\nspace\u2019) and {\u03a0x,\u03a0y,\u03a0z, I\u03a0} for 2\u00d72 Pauli matrices and\nthe unit matrix that operate in K-point space. For ex-\nample, the operator \u03b1 may be written as a direct product\n\u03b1 = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c3. Note that the boundary conditions of the\nHadron bag model[19], in which elementary particles are\nconfined by a scalar (mass) term at the boundary, are\ndescribed by M = \u03bd2.\u03a0 \u2297 nB.\u03c3. Berry and Mondragon\n[20] considered \u201cneutrino billiards\u201d with a two compo-\nnent Dirac equation confined by a term proportional to\n\u03c3z , corresponding to M = I\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3 or M = \u03a0z \u2297 n2.\u03c3\nwith either n1 or n2 lying in the (x, y) plane.\nThere are two non-equivalent K-points that we label\nas K and K\u02dc. The Dirac equation is diagonal in K-point\nspace, so that, in the absence of boundary conditions,\nthere are two right moving (\u03a8\n(R)\nK and \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\n) and two left\nmoving (\u03a8\n(L)\nK and \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\n) plane wave solutions near the\nFermi surface of a metallic tube. The solutions \u03a8\n(R)\nK and\n\u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\nare eigenvectors of the pseudo-spin component along\nthe tube axis \u03a3.nB with eigenvalue +s, whereas the so-\nlutions \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK have eigenvalue \u2212s, where s = \u00b11\nfor the conduction and valence band, respectively. Also,\nthe solutions \u03a8\n(R)\nK and \u03a8\n(L)\nK are eigenvectors of pseudo-\nhelicity \u2212i\u03a3.\u2207\/|q| with eigenvalue +s, whereas the so-\nlutions \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\nhave eigenvalue \u2212s. There are dif-\nferent ways of combining the right and left moving waves\nin order to create standing waves. The first possibility\nis that waves at the same K-point combine, namely \u03a8\n(R)\nK\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK form a standing wave with helicity eigenvalue\n+s, and \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\nform a standing wave with helic-\nity eigenvalue\u2212s. This situation is realised by the matrix\nM1, Eq.(3), because it is diagonal in K-point space. A\nsecond possibility is that waves from opposite K-points\ncombine, namely \u03a8\n(R)\nK and \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\nform a standing wave\nwith spin component eigenvalue +s, and \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK\nform a standing wave with spin component eigenvalue\n\u2212s. This situation is realised by the matrix M2, Eq.(4),\nbecause it is off-diagonal in K-point space. A third pos-\nsibility is a combination of the previous two, with waves\nscattered back at the boundary into a mixture of both\nof the K-points. This situation is realised by the matri-\nces M3, Eq.(5), and M4, Eq.(6), because they have both\ndiagonal and off-diagonal in K-point space parts.\nEFFECTIVE MASS MODEL\nIn the effective mass model of two-dimensional\ngraphite [15], the total wavefunction \u03a8tot is written as\na linear combination of four components m = {1, 2, 3, 4}\ncorresponding to two K-points \u00b5 = {1, 2} and \u03c0-type\natomic orbitals \u03d5j(r\u2212Rj) on two non-equivalent atomic\nsites j = {A,B} in the unit cell,\n\u03a8tot (r) =\n4\u2211\nm=1\n{\n\u03a6(0)m (r)\u2212Gm (r) .\u2207+ . . .\n}\n\u03c8m (r) ,\n(7)\nwhere\n\u03a6(0)m (r) =\n1\u221a\nN\nN\u2211\nRj\neiK\u00b5.Rj\u03d5j(r\u2212Rj), (8)\nGm (r) =\n1\u221a\nN\nN\u2211\nRj\neiK\u00b5.Rj\u03d5j(r\u2212Rj)(r \u2212Rj), (9)\nare Bloch type functions constructed from the atomic or-\nbitals, Rj is the position of an atom in real space and the\nsummation is over the number of unit cells N \u226b 1. The\nfunctions \u03c8m (r) are components of the envelope function\n\u03a8 (q, r). Substituting this expression for \u03a8tot into the\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation and integrating with respect to fast\ndegrees of freedom that vary on the scale of the unit cell\nleads to the Dirac equation Eq.(2) for the envelope func-\ntion \u03a8 where the K-points are taken as K = (\u00b14\u03c0\/3a, 0)\nand the components of \u03a8 are written in the order KA,\nKB, K\u02dcB, K\u02dcA. The appearance of the chiral angle of the\ntube \u03b7 in the Dirac equation shows that the axes of the\n(x, y) coordinate system have been rotated to be trans-\nverse and parallel to the tube axis. Applying periodic\nboundary conditions to the wavefunction \u03a8tot, Eq.(7), in\nthe direction transverse to the nanotube axis produces a\n3condition for the envelope function \u03a8 that leads to metal-\nlic or semiconducting behaviour depending on whether\nthe transverse component of wavevector q is allowed to\nbe zero [16, 17].\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE\nEFFECTIVE MASS MODEL\nIn order to obtain hard wall boundary conditions for\nthe Dirac equation, we place an additional confinement\npotential at the boundary r = rB,[\n\u2212iv\u03b1.\u2207+ cvM\u02dc\u03b4 (r\u2212 rB)\n]\n\u03a8 = E\u03a8, (10)\nwhere c is a real constant and M\u02dc is an arbitrary 4 \u00d7 4\nHermitian, unitary matrix, M\u02dc2 = 1. The orientation of\nthe boundary is defined by a unit vector nB normal to\nit, and we assume that the wavefunction is zero outside\nthe confined region, but non-zero inside it. Then, we\nintegrate across an infinitesimal width of the boundary,\ngiving\n\u2212 inB.\u03b1\u03a8 = cM\u02dc\u03a8. (11)\nSubstituting this equation back into itself, we find the\nrequirements that c2M\u02dc2 = 1 (thus we set c = 1) and{\nnB.\u03b1, M\u02dc\n}\n= 0. The boundary condition can be writ-\nten as \u03a8 = M\u03a8 where M = inB.\u03b1M\u02dc , M\n2 = 1 and\n{nB.\u03b1,M} = 0, giving the result quoted in the introduc-\ntion Eq.(2).\nIf, in the graphite coordinate system, we define\nthe normal to the boundary as nB = (sin \u03b7, cos \u03b7, 0),\nwhere \u03b7 is the chiral angle of the tube, then\nwe may choose two mutually orthogonal 3D vectors\nas n1 = (cos \u03b7 sin \u03b6,\u2212 sin \u03b7 sin \u03b6, cos \u03b6) and n2 =\n(cos \u03b7 cos \u03b6,\u2212 sin \u03b7 cos \u03b6,\u2212 sin \u03b6), and two additional or-\nthogonal 2D vectors as \u03bd1 = (cos \u03be, sin \u03be, 0) and \u03bd2 =\n(\u2212 sin \u03be, cos \u03be, 0). This introduces two new mixing an-\ngles, \u03b6 and \u03be: the arbitrary parameters contained within\nthe boundary conditions describe the amount of mix-\ning between different discrete symmetries. First, we\nnote that the pseudo-spin of a 2D graphite sheet does\nnot transform in the same way as the spin of relativis-\ntic fermions, because certain transformations result in\na swapping of the orientation of A and B atoms. This\nadditional operation is described by a \u201cpseudo-spin-flip\u201d\noperator \u03c1z = \u03a0x \u2297 i\u03c3z that corresponds to a reflection\nin the (x, y) plane of relativistic fermions. For example,\nan active rotation of the 2D graphite sheet anticlockwise\nby \u03c0\/3 about the perpendicular z axis, \u03a8 (r\u2032) = C6\u03a8(r),\nis described by C6 = \u03c1zR(\u03c0\/3) = \u03a0x \u2297 exp ((2\u03c0i\/3)\u03c3z)\nwhere R(\u03b8) = I\u03a0\u2297exp ((i\u03b8\/2)\u03c3z) is a continuous rotation\noperator.\nTable 1 shows a summary of the discrete symmetries\nof the boundary conditions in terms of the orientation\nof the vectors n1, n2, \u03bd1 and \u03bd2. In addition to \u03c1z we\nconsider parity P = \u03a0x \u2297 I\u03c3, corresponding to a rota-\ntion by \u03c0 about the z axis (x \u2192 \u2212x and y \u2192 \u2212y), and\ncharge conjugation (C) and time reversal symmetry (T )\nthat involve the complex conjugation operator combined\nwith C = \u2212i\u03a0y \u2297 \u03c3y and T = I\u03a0 \u2297 \u03c3y, respectively.\nThe angles \u03b6 and \u03be mix terms with different symmetry\nwith respect to \u03c1z : \u03b6 = 0 and \u03be = 0 correspond to even-\nness with respect to \u03c1z whereas \u03b6 = \u03c0\/2 and \u03be = \u03c0\/2\ncorrespond to oddness. Since spin and\/or helicity label\ndifferent states at the same energy, values of \u03b6 and \u03be not\nequal to multiples of \u03c0\/2 will lead to broken degeneracy.\nThe angles \u039b,\u03a5,\u0398 and \u2126 mix different symmetries with\nrespect to combinations of P , C and \u03c1z.\nM \u03c1z P C T\nI\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3 n1 = n(x,y) \u03b6u = pi2 \u22121 +1 +1 \u22121\nn1 = nz \u03b6u = 0 +1 +1 +1 \u22121\n\u03a0z \u2297 n2.\u03c3 n2 = n(x,y) \u03b6u = 0 +1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121\nn2 = nz \u03b6u =\npi\n2 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121\n\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3 \u03bd1= \u0131\u02c6 \u03beu = 0 +1 +1 +1 +1\n\u03bd1= \uf6be\u02c6 \u03beu =\npi\n2 \u22121 \u22121 +1 \u22121\n\u03bd2.\u03a0\u2297 nB.\u03c3 \u03bd2= \u0131\u02c6 \u03beu = \u2212pi2 \u22121 +1 \u22121 \u22121\n\u03bd2= \uf6be\u02c6 \u03beu = 0 +1 \u22121 \u22121 +1\nDiscrete symmetries of the boundary conditions\nSINGLE PARTICLE ENERGY SPECTRUM\nIn order to illustrate the meaning of the general bound-\nary conditions, we calculate the form of non-interacting\nsingle particle standing waves created by the boundary\nconditions and the corresponding energy spectrum. For\nsimplicity, we will consider only metallic nanotubes with\narbitrary chiral angle \u03b7.

We introduce an\nindex u = {R,L} \u2261 \u00b11 to label the right and left\nhand side so that the normal to the boundary, de-\nfined with respect to the graphite coordinate system,\nis nB = u(sin \u03b7, cos \u03b7, 0), and we take into account the\npossibility of different mixing angles, \u039bu,\u03a5u,\u0398u and \u2126u,\nand vectors n1 = (u cos \u03b7 sin \u03b6u,\u2212u sin \u03b7 sin \u03b6u, cos \u03b6u),\nn2 = (u cos\u03b7 cos \u03b6u,\u2212u sin \u03b7 cos \u03b6u,\u2212 sin \u03b6u), \u03bd1 =\n(cos \u03beu, sin \u03beu, 0) and \u03bd2 = (\u2212 sin \u03beu, cos \u03beu, 0).\nM1: diagonal boundary conditions\nWith the above definitions of the mixing angles, the\nboundary condition \u03a8 = M1\u03a8 produces the following\nrelations between the components of the wavefunction at\nthe interface:\nu sin (\u03b6u + \u039bu) e\n\u2212i\u03b7\u03c8AK \u2212 [1 + cos (\u03b6u + \u039bu)]\u03c8BK = 0,\nu sin (\u03b6u \u2212 \u039bu) e+i\u03b7\u03c8AK\u02dc \u2212 [1\u2212 cos (\u03b6u \u2212 \u039bu)]\u03c8BK\u02dc = 0.\nThe equations are diagonal in K-point space so do not de-\nscribe intervalley scattering.

The spectrum al-\nways has positive-negative energy symmetry, but broken\ndegeneracy for \u03ba 6= {0, \u03c0}.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this paper, we considered the effective mass model\nof spinless electrons in single wall carbon nanotubes that\ndescribes slowly varying spatial envelope wavefunctions\n\u03a8 (q, r) with small wavevectors q in the region of lin-\near dispersion E = \u00b1v|q| near the K-points. Taking\ninto account the two inequivalent K-points, the envelope\nwavefunctions \u03a8 obey the Dirac equation for massless\nfermions, written in terms of four component spinors,\nwith the role of spin assumed by the relative ampli-\ntude of the wave function on the sublattice atoms (\u201cA\u201d\nand \u201cB\u201d). We found that energy independent hard wall\nboundary conditions for the Dirac equation may be writ-\nten as \u03a8 =M\u03a8 where M is an Hermitian, unitary 4\u00d7 4\nmatrixM2 = 1 with the additional constraint that it an-\nticommutes with the component of the current operator\nnormal to the boundary. All possible linear combinations\nof matrices M obeying these constraints were expressed\nin terms of a small number of arbitrary parameters, mix-\ning angles, that describe mixing between boundary con-\nditions with different discrete symmetries. Then, in order\nto illustrate how the presence of non-zero mixing angles\nbreaks K-point degeneracy and electron-hole symmetry,\nwe evaluated the resulting energy level spectra for non-\ninteracting electrons in finite-length metallic nanotubes\nand the corresponding standing wave envelope functions.\nThe intention of this paper was to classify all possible\nboundary conditions for the spatially long-range envelope\nfunctions of a closed nanotube with length much greater\nthan its circumference L \u226b Lc. The analysis was re-\nstricted to energy independent boundary conditions, al-\nthough in principle they could be generalised by perform-\ning a gradient expansion. We focused on armchair tubes\nand did not consider the possibility of edge states that\nmay exist in zigzag graphite edges [21, 22, 23]. Rather\nthan modelling the microscopic details of a boundary,\nsuch as shape or roughness, the nature of the bound-\nary is characterised by mixing angles that describe the\ndegree of symmetry breaking. In practice, the correct\nchoice of a particular set of boundary conditions and val-\nues of symmetry mixing angles needed to describe a given\nnanotube will depend on experimental details and may\nnot be known beforehand. To illustrate this, we com-\npare our results to the idealised microscopic models of a\na capped armchair nanotube and a model of a bound-\nary obtained by setting the wavefunction to zero along\na straight line of atoms. We find that the description of\na capped nanotube considered in Ref. [13] corresponds\nto our off-diagonal boundary conditions M2, \u03a8 = M2\u03a8,\nwith \u03a5u = 0 or \u03c0 so that the component \u03c8AK of the wave-\nfunction is related to \u03c8BK\u02dc at the boundary. A model of\na boundary obtained by setting the wavefunction to zero,\nwhich is equivalent to a particle-in-a-box model [14], also\ncorresponds to our off-diagonal boundary conditions M2,\n\u03a8 = M2\u03a8, but with \u03a5u = \u00b1\u03c0\/2 so that the compo-\nnent \u03c8AK of the wavefunction is related to \u03c8AK\u02dc at the\nboundary. Although the two models are described by a\ndifferent mixing angle \u03a5, they both correspond to the\noff-diagonal boundary conditions, introduce inter-valley\nscattering at the boundary and, in general, they break\nK-point degeneracy with the mixing angle \u03beu dependent\non the length of the nanotube.\nThe authors thank J T Chalker and C J Lambert for\ndiscussions, and EPSRC for financial support.\n6APPENDIX\nIn this appendix, we briefly describe the method of\nfinding linear combinations of matrices that satisfy the\nconstraints on M described by the boundary conditions,\nEq. (2). Any 4 \u00d7 4 matrix may be written as a linear\ncombination of the matrices I\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3, I\u03a0\u2297 (n.\u03c3), (\u03bd.\u03a0)\u2297\nI\u03c3, and (\u03bd.\u03a0)\u2297(n.\u03c3), where n and \u03bd are arbitrary three-\ndimensional space-like vectors. The first step is to find\nall the linear combinations that produce the unit matrix\nI\u03a0 \u2297 I\u03c3 when squared:\nMa = I\u03a0 \u2297 I\u03c3,\nMb = cos \u03b8 (I\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3) + sin \u03b8 (\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 n2.\u03c3) ,\nMc = cos\u03c6 (\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3) + sin\u03c6 (\u03bd2.\u03a0\u2297 n2.\u03c3) ,\nwhere the vectors are unit vectors with additional con-\nstraints n1.n2 = 0, \u03bd1.\u03bd2 = 0 that ensure no cross-terms\nsurvive. The next step is to find the conditions under\nwhich the matrices Ma, Mb, and Mc anticommute with\nthe operator nB.\u03b1 that is proportional to the component\nof the current operator normal to the interface. Clearly,\nMa does not anticommute, so it is discarded. The matrix\nMb anticommutes if n1.nB = 0, n2.nB = 0, and \u03bd1 = k\u02c6\n(M1), or if n1.nB = 0, n2 = nB, and \u03bd1 is confined to\nthe (x, y) plane (M3). The matrix Mc anticommutes if\n\u03bd1 and \u03bd2 are confined to the (x, y) plane and n2 = nB\n(M2), or if \u03bd1 is confined to the (x, y) plane, \u03bd2 = k\u02c6, and\nn2.nB = 0 (M4).\n[1] Saito R, Dresselhaus G and Dresselhaus M S 1988 Phys-\nical properties of carbon nanotubes (Imperial College\nPress: London).\n[2] Dekker C 1999 Physics Today 52 (5) 22.\n[3] Bockrath M, Cobden D H, McEuen P L, Chopra N G,\nZettl A, Thess A and Smalley R E 1997 Science 275\n1922.\n[4] Tans S J, Devoret M H, Dai H, Thess A, Smalley R E,\nGeerlings L J and Dekker C 1997 Nature 386 474.\n[5] Venema L C, Wildoer J W G, Janssen J W, Tans S J,\nTemminck Tuinstra H L J, Kouwenhoven L P and Dekker\nC 1999 Science 283 52.\n[6] Lemay S G, Janssen J W, van den Hout M, Mooij M,\nBronikowski M J, Willis P A, Smalley R E, Kouwenhoven\nL P and Dekker C 2001 Nature 412 617.\n[7] Liang W, Bockrath M and Park H 2002 Phys.
