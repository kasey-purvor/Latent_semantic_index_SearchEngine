Observed quality was lowest in nurseries at each age point, \nexcept that at eighteen months they offered more learning activities. There were few \ndifferences in the observed quality of care by child minders, grandparents and nannies, \nalthough grandparents had somewhat lower safety and health scores and offered children \nfewer activities. Cost was largely unrelated to quality of care except in child minding where \nhigher cost was associated  with higher quality.  Observed ratios of children to adults  had a \nsignificant impact on quality of nursery care; the more infants or toddlers each adult had to \ncare for the lower the quality of the care she gave them. Mothers\u2019 overall satisfaction with \ntheir child\u2019s care was positively associated with its quality for home-based care but not for  \nnursery settings.  \nKeywords \nChild care; infancy; nurseries; childminding; maternal child care choice, satisfaction. \n 2\nThe quality of different types of child care at 10 and 18 months: a comparison \nbetween types and factors related to quality \n \nThe importance of child care quality \nAs research on the impact of child care on children\u2019s development has progressed, the \noverweening importance of the quality of care has become clear (Borge et al., 1996; Lamb \n1998; Melhuish, 2004; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Early \nChild Care Research Network (NICHD) 2002a; 2002b; 2001f; 2001h; Petrogiannis & \nMelhuish, 1996; Smith, 1998).  As Ramey (NICHD 2005) commented \u201c...collectively this \nstudy [NICHD] unequivocally demonstrates that both the quality and the quantity of \nnonparental care influence children\u2019s development. Stated directly and summatively, poor \nquality care is harmful. Conversely, high quality care can be somewhat beneficial....\u201d ( pp. \n427-436).  Whatever the aims and parameters of studies of child care, quality is almost \ncertain to be a factor in the findings.  \n Quality of child care has an impact on many aspects of children\u2019s development. Most \nwidespread have been studies showing relationships between quality and various aspects of \nchildren\u2019s social development and behaviour. For example Howes and Olenick (1986) \nstudied center care and compliance in a sample of American infants at 18, 24 and 36 months \nat home, in day care, and in a structured observation. The best predictor of children\u2019s overall \nnon-compliance was quality of care, with children from high quality centres showing more \ncompliance and cooperativeness than children from low quality centres.  Howes (1990) in the \nUSA and Beller et al. (1996) in Germany reported positive correlations between quality of \ncare and a range of other aspects of social competence. Immediately before and after changes \nin Florida child care regulations and consequent improvement in quality, Howes et al. (1995) \nwere able to show associations with improvements in peer interactions. Similarly, a multi-site \n 3\nstudy in four American states found that after controlling for family background , higher \nquality of care was associated with better social  competence (Cost, Quality and Childcare \nOutcomes Study Team, 1995) as did the NIHCD study (NICHD, 2002c). Phillips et al. \n(2001) and Volling and Feagans (1995)  found that centres with higher quality care had \nchildren with better peer relations  while in a study of Israeli family day care, Rosenthal \n(1990) found that aspects of the quality of care were related to the frequency of \naggressive interactions. \n Recently studies have also shown links between child care quality and measures of \nchildren\u2019s cortisol. In full-time day care cortisol levels tend to rise throughout the day, in \ncontrast to the typical diurnal pattern, an endocrine response indicative of increased \nstress. Increasing cortisol levels are more likely as the quality of day care decreases. \nSome studies report associated increases in behaviour problems (Bruce et al., 2002; \nDettling et al., 2000). \n Child care quality has also been shown to be positively related to cognitive and \nlanguage development. Vandell (2002), reporting on the NICHD sample at the age of  54 \nmonths, found that children with child care in the highest tercile of quality achieved \nsignificantly higher scores on \u201cpre-academics\u201d and language than children in child care in the \nlowest tercile. However the most powerful finding from that NICHD study, further \nreported in NICHD (2005), concerned the quantity rather than the quality of child care. \nMore time in non-maternal care across the first four and a half years of life predicted \nmore problem behaviour, particularly antisocial and aggressive behaviour, at 4-5 years of \nage. These effects were only partially mediated by quality of childcare. The effects and \ninteraction of quantity and quality of child care vary in different populations. For \nexample,  while Waldfogel & Brooks-Gunn (2001) report that maternal employment in \nthe first year of life is associated with increased behaviour problems a recent re-analysis \n 4\nsuggests that this effect may only be present where the quality of child care is below \naverage (Brooks-Gunn, 2002), while in an analysis of the NLSY dataset, a large-scale, \nrepresentative, US sample,  Youngblade (2003) finds that maternal employment in the \nfirst year of life is associated with behaviour problems for boys but not girls. In England, \nthe Effective Provision of Pre-school Education (EPPE) study of over 3,000 children \nfound that early child care, particularly in the first two years, is associated with antisocial \nbehaviour at 3 and 5 years of age (Melhuish et al., 2001; Sammons et al., 2003b). Hours \nin non-parental care have also been shown to be associated with behaviour problems in \nthe results of a new longitudinal study of 17,000 children from 900 kindergartens in the \nUSA (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, ELLS-K). (Ritter & Turner, 2003). \n Defining child care quality \nChild care quality has been described as a \u201cslippery and multifaceted construct that \nrequires careful measurement and interpretation\u201d (Hwang et al., 1991, p.117). It has even \nbeen suggested (Pence & Moss, 1994) that quality is not an objective reality but a relative \nvalue varying depending on the informant, who might be a parent, a child care worker, a \npolicy maker or even a child. Confusing good quality with good outcomes is a hazard in \nconceptualising quality of child care. While quality of child care is positively related to many \naspects of children\u2019s ongoing development. It is also positively related to children\u2019s day to \nday happiness and security and to parents\u2019 satisfaction with child care. In the UK efforts have \nbeen made to develop a theoretical framework, and consequently methods of assessing \nquality, that can be incorporated into good practice, inform care providers and establish ways \nto improve services (Munton et al., 1995; Pence & Moss, 1994). This conceptualisation \nincorporates a \u2018children\u2019s rights\u2019 approach: irrespective of differences in long-term outcomes \nyoung children have a right to the best quality day care that can be provided. Even if this \nprinciple is accepted, however, the question: what is \u201cbest quality\u201d remains to be answered.  \n 5\nAs in any other setting, \u201cchildren in child care need to be safe, healthy, responded to \nsensitively and appropriately, and encouraged to develop their potential\u201d (Barnes, 2001, p. \n4).   \n Child-caregiver relationships have been shown to be an important aspect of quality \nof care. Scarr (1998) in a review, concluded that \u201cquality child care is warm, supportive \ninteractions with adults in a safe, healthy and stimulating environment, where early \neducation and trusting relationships combine to support individual children\u2019s physical, \nemotional, social and intellectual development\u201d (p. 100). A range of desirable practitioner \nqualities identified in the literature as fundamental to facilitating good quality relationships \nbetween adults and children, includes sensitivity, empathy and attunement,  (e.g. Davis et al., \n2002; Elfer, et al., 2002; Post & Hohmann, 2000).  Being cared for by adults possessing these \nqualities and attitudes can help infants and young children to feel confident in themselves, \nencourage them to communicate and talk, to think and have ideas, and to learn and discover.  \nThe degree to which trusted caregivers are available for  individual children has recently been \nshown to be a key feature of quality of care (Clasien de Schipper et al., 2004). These carer-\nqualities are closely linked with the concept of the key person in group child care (Lindon, \n2003).  They are featured in the UK\u2019s Key Elements of Effective Practice (KEEP; \nDepartment for Education & Skills; 2004) and Common Core Skills and Knowledge for the \nChildren\u2019s Workforce (Department for Education & Skills, Staffing continuity, consistency \nand ratios; 2005).   \n Children who experience greater caregiver stability while attending early years \nsettings have been found to have more secure relationships with their caregivers and to show \nhigher degrees of social competence (Howes & Hamilton, 1992; 1993; Raikes, 1993).  \nCaregiver stability has been widely defined, including availability, the amount of time a \ncaregiver spends with individual children (Barnas & Cummings, 1994; Raikes, 1993); the \n 6\nfrequency of changes in the primary caregiver (Howes & Hamilton, 1992; 1993); rate of staff \nturnover (Clarke-Stewart et al., 1994; Whitebrook et al., 2001) and the number of different \narrangements experienced by an individual child (NICHD Early Child Research Network, \n1997a, 1997b, 1998). \n Structural - and regulatable - aspects of child care have also been found to be \nassociated with quality. Factors such as adult-child ratios, group sizes, children\u2019s ages at \nentry and hours in the facility, and caregivers\u2019 qualifications have been found to be predictive \nof  sensitive, positive caregiving and of children\u2019s early socio-emotional development \n(Clarke-Stewart et al., 1994; NICHD, 2005; Phillips, 1987; Vandell & Wolfe, 2000). Along \nwith lower staff turnover rates, such factors are associated with positive practitioner-child \nrelationships and increased social competence and social adjustment among the children  (e.g. \nBorge & Melhuish, 1995; Richman & McGuire (n. Barnes), 1988; Scarr et al., 1994). \n Nevertheless, structural information, relatively easily garnered from administrative \nsources, cannot be relied upon to infer quality of process.  In a study of 120 American centres \nonly one of six regulatable characteristics - the highest wage paid- was significantly \ncorrelated with observed quality (Scarr et al., 1994).  Another large study in the USA (Howes \net al., 1992) did find that process quality rose as the adult: child ratio increased, but these \nwere observed ratios, taken every 15 minutes over several hours of observation.  It is not \nenough to know the official ratios for a nursery as these are not routinely met in practice \n(McGuire (n. Barnes) & Richman, 1989; Scarr et al., 1994).  \nQuality of different types of child care \nAt present it is as difficult to compare the quality of different types of child care as it \nis to compare different views of the constituents of quality. Apart from inspection data, \npresenting a strictly limited, structural view of available types of child care (e.g. OFSTED,  \n2005) most of  the research showing the positive impact of high-quality early years practice \n 7\n(Graham , 2005; NICHD Early Childcare Research Network, 1999; Sylva et al., 2004) and \nthe negative impact of poor quality of care, as well as too much care or care too early in life, \n(Gunnar, 1998;  Melhuish,  2005) is more concerned with within-type than across-type \ndifferences in quality. Even when large scale studies collect quality data for a range of child \ncare types, that range is usually collapsed to two or three categories so as to optimise \nnumbers for analysis. An honourable exception is the EPPE study of 3,000 English children \n(Melhuish, 2001; Sammons et al., 2003b) in which types of child care were largely kept \ndistinct and showed significant differences. For example child care in the first two years by a \nrelative was associated with less antisocial behaviour at 3 and 5 years in contrast with very \nhigh levels of child care by childminders, or moderately high levels of care in nurseries or \ncenters, which were associated with more antisocial behaviour. Very similar results were also \nfound in the EPPNI study of 850 children in Northern Ireland (Melhuish et al. 2002a).  In the \nFamilies, Children and Child Care study (Barnes et al., 2006; Leach et al., forthcoming) \nparental ideals, experiences and levels of satisfaction were analysed separately for father care, \ngrandparent\/ relative care, nanny care, child minder care and nursery\/center care. It is the \nobserved differences in the relative qualities of these care types at each of  two age points that \nare the subject of the present paper. \nQuality and costs of care \nCost to the consumer is often assumed to be the most important determinant of the type of \ncare parents select and the relative \u201caffordability\u201d of one type of child care compared with \nothers is frequently mentioned by researchers, policy-makers and parents. However, in their \nreview of research into child care choices Pungello and Kurtz-Costes (1999) showed that \nrelatively low price is only one of several extrinsic characteristics of which parents take \naccount, location, hours and reliability often being equally important. Nevertheless, if cost is \nnot the principal criterion for many parents, it remains a significant factor as data from a \n 8\nrecent qualitative study in England show (Leach et al., forthcoming)..  Unfortunately the \nliterature contains little detailed information on the relative costs to parents of different types \nof child care because it is both difficult to obtain and easily outdated by changes in the \nbalance between public and private provision and by subsidies and tax breaks. Even large \nscale research studies, such as the NICHD study (2005, pp.122-126) often eschew price \ncomparisons so most of the data available on the affordability of child care is based on \ndifferences in parental (or maternal or familial) income rather than differences in outgoings \nby type of child care.  \n Cost matters, but its importance is not straightforward. Recent studies from the USA \nand from Europe have put it into a wide context, exploring the complex relationships in \nwomen\u2019s child care choices between external circumstances, including different economic \nopportunities and labour market conditions, and personal attitudes (Fagan 2000; Hakim, \n2001; Pungello & Kurtz-Costes, 2000)  while a study from the UK analysed the \u201cchoices\u201d \nrecent government policies have made available to mothers; the  relationships  in their child \ncare decision-making between external constraints and  existing attitudes and preferences , \nand the policy implications. (Himmelweit & Sigala, 2003).  \nQualities looked for by mothers \nWhile much of the literature suggests that extrinsic factors such as cost, geographical locality \nand easy access dominate families\u2019 choices of child care (Mortimer, et al., 2003; Peyton et \nal., 2001) there is also evidence that  many mothers seeking child care look for personal \nrather than practical or professional attributes. In a large study in the USA, for example \n(Kontos et al., 1995) most mothers gave some attribute of the caregiver as their first reason \nfor choosing their care arrangement. In an English study of 1200 families (Barnes et al., \n2006) mothers who needed non-maternal infant care often preferred it to be familial, many \nregarding care by a grandparent as ideal. Throughout the first year mothers were more \n 9\nsatisfied with the care given by individuals - relatives, childminders, nannies - than by more \nthan one caregiver, in larger groups such as nurseries.    Not all parents have clear views \nabout what they should look for when choosing child care, however (Van Horn et al., 2001). \nSome cannot think what qualities to list as desirable in a child care arrangement, while others \nlist factors that do not reliably match those that professionals use as indices of quality. \nFurthermore, despite its use in many studies as a paradigm for child care quality, parental \nsatisfaction with care is not an index of its actual quality. Parental reports of high levels of \nsatisfaction are normative even though their care arrangements vary widely (Bogat & \nGensheimer, 1986; Rassin et al., 1991). Parental satisfaction with care is likely to be \nespecially high when parent involvement is encouraged and the care provider listens to the \nparent (Barnes, et al., 2006; Britner & Phillips, 1995). In the USA it has been found that \nparents generally rate their children\u2019s care more highly than independent observers do (Cryer \n& Burchinal, 1997).  It may be that parents\u2019 ratings reflect their own positive relationship \nwith the caregiver, or their hopes for their children\u2019s care, rather than a reality which may be \ndifficult for them to observe or, perhaps, to tolerate.  As Munton (1995) suggested, it should \nbe possible to have a universal framework within which different views can be compared . In \nthe meantime parents reasons for choosing child care arrangements are important in \nthemselves. Peyton et al. (2001) found that parents who reported basing their child care \nchoice  on quality indicators actually placed their children in higher quality care settings than \nparents who used practical criteria for care selection. The relationship between the observed \nquality of different types of child care and the qualities looked for by mothers is explored in \nthe present study.  \nMeasuring child care quality \nChoice of methods and measures of child care quality, reviewed by Barnes (2001), \nmust take account of three main parameters. Firstly, the purposes inherent in different \n 10\nobservational measures of quality can be grouped broadly into two contrasting approaches.  \nOne type of measure, principally from the USA, has been academic and research oriented, \ndeveloping methods that can be used to test ideas about the relevance of quality for child \noutcomes.  The second type of measure is designed to meet the need to measure quality for \nlicensing, regulation and, where necessary, improvement of child care offered to the general \npublic,. Both types of measure may be needed, as in the present study. (Cryer & Phillipsen, \n1997) \n Secondly, a choice must be made or, as here, a balance struck between recording \nstructure - perhaps from administrative records or interviews with child care staff - and \nobserving process in child care settings. The latter is more accurate and predictive but also \nmore demanding of research resources.  Thirdly, a major methodological concern, especially \nwhen observing child care in group settings, is how to reflect the quality of each individual \ncarer , the quality of each child\u2019s experience with each of several carers, and also arrive at a \nfinal estimate of the overall quality that represents the centre or care home rather than one \nperson\u2019s experience. In the present study several complementary assessments were used but \nnot entirely  successfully. \nAims and Hypotheses \nThe main aim of this paper is to compare the quality of child care offered to infants \nand  toddlers in different types of setting in the UK,  and to identify which (if any) structural \nfactors are associated with higher quality child care. In addition the study seeks to determine \nthe nature of any relationships between the qualities mothers identify as important and the \nquality observed; the observed behaviour of mothers and that of their caregivers and their \nsatisfaction with the child care they are using, and its quality. \nThe research hypotheses are: \n 11\n1.  Observed quality of care will be higher in domestic settings with one caregiver than in \ngroup settings with several caregivers  \n2.. Considering separately two dimensions of quality, those aspects of quality related to \ncognitive stimulation will be higher in group care while those aspects of quality reflecting \nsensitivity will be higher in single caregiver settings,  \n3. Structural and regulatable features of child care (e.g. cost, child\/adult ratios) will be \nassociated with observed quality. \n 4. The qualities (characteristics) of child care preferred by mothers will not be associated \nwith the observed quality of their children's care  \n5. The observed quality of maternal behaviour will be associated with the observed quality of \ntheir child\u2019s care. \n6. Mothers\u2019 satisfaction with child care will be associated with its quality. \n \nMETHODS \nProcedures \n1. Interviews with mothers \nFace-to-face home interviews with mothers were conducted when their infants were 3, 10 and \n18 months old.  Demographic information was collected at the first interview. At each time \npoint mothers were asked about their current type and amount of child care and its cost. At \nthe 10 and 18 month interviews they were also asked in retrospect about the type and amount \nof any child care used between 4 - 9 and 11 - 17 months respectively.  These responses were \nused to determine the dominant form of child care at each age point; this was the child care \nsetting observed  if more than one type of care had been used, \n2. Observations of quality of child care   \n 12\nDuring the home interviews at 10 and 18 months, observations to determine the quality of \nmaternal behaviour were also conducted. Observations to determine the quality of children\u2019s \nnon-maternal care were carried out in the child care settings at both the 10 and 18 month time \npoints, excluding those children cared for primarily by their fathers, the subject of a separate \nstudy (Lewis et al., forthcoming) and a small number of families using a friend to provide \nchild care.  \nParticipants \nAt 10 months, 424 child carers were approached of whom 307 were observed (see Table 1), \ncomprising 84 grandparents, 33 nannies, 85 childminders and 102 nurseries. \nAt 18 months, 422 child carers were approached, of whom 331 were observed (see Table 1) \ncomprising 81 grandparents, 38 nannies, 83 childminders and 129 nurseries.  Those observed \nwere compared to the total group (child sex, demographic characteristics, maternal age, area \ndeprivation) and they were comparable except that those observed contained a smaller \nproportion of non-white children, and the mothers of those observed had a significantly \nhigher average occupational status (see Table 1).  The characteristics of families using the \nfour types of child care in question also differed in some ways both at 10 months and at 18 \nmonths (see Tables 2 and 3).  Those using grandparent care at both age points were on \naverage younger, with fewer educational qualifications, lower social class and living in \npoorer neighbourhoods.  In addition fewer of those using a grandparent for child care at 10 \nmonths were living with a partner.  Those using nannies at both 10 and 18 months had more \nchildren and were better off financially (see Tables 2 and 3). \nMeasures \nFamily Background  \nAt both time points mothers reported on background characteristics of their children (age, \ngender, ethnic group), themselves (age, education, occupation) and the family (living with \n 13\npartner, family income, adversity of living conditions). Maternal educational qualifications \nwere scaled on a six-point scale from 1 = vocational qualifications at 16 or below, to 6 = \nhigher degree or above. Maternal occupational status was defined according to the Computer \nAssisted Standard Occupational Coding, (CASOC; Elias, et al, 1993), using the three group \nordinal categorisation: (1 = working class occupations (e.g. factory work or low level job in \nservice industries), 2 = intermediate occupations (e.g. secretary, data entry), 3 = managerial \nand professional (e.g. the professions, senior management jobs). The Child Poverty Index \n(CPI) from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2000 (Noble et al., 2000) was used as a \nmeasure of area level deprivation. The CPI is an aggregate measure of the proportion of \nfamilies with 0-16 year old children within an electoral ward who receive means tested \nbenefits (income support, job seekers allowance, family credit and disability working \nallowance), a higher value indicating more deprivation. Two subscales from the HOME \ninventory (Bradley & Caldwell, 1989) were also completed during maternal interviews \u2013 \nEmotional and Verbal Responsivity, and Avoidance of restriction and Punishment, at both \ntime points. \nTypes of Child Care \nFour types of non-parental child care are compared in this study: care by a grandparent or \nother relative; care by a nanny in the child\u2019s home; care by a child minder in her home and \ngroup care in a nursery or centre. The dominant (observed) form of non-maternal care at 10 \nmonths and at 18 months was decided according to the following formula: if the child had \nonly one type of care for 12 weekly hours or more, this was the dominant form. If the child \nhad two or more types of care which together totalled 12 weekly hours or more, the one with \nthe most hours was the dominant form. If a child had an equal number of weekly hours in two \nor more types of care, the type that was most different from maternal care was selected for \nobservation (e.g. childminder would be chosen over a grandparent as non-familial, and over a \n 14\nnanny as taking place outside the child's home; nursery care would be chosen over all other \ntypes as it was non-familial, outside the home and using multiple carers in a group setting). \nMeasures of Quality and Structure of Child Care \n1. The Caregiver Interaction Scale (CIS; Arnett, 1989) was completed across all non-maternal \nchild care settings. Three of the original four sub-scales were used, excluding   \n'Permissiveness', with some reductions in items that were not appropriate for children of this \nage (details available on request). All items are rated on 4-point scales by the observers \nasking themselves \u201cto what extent are each of the following statements characteristic of this \ncaregiver?\u201d (1 = not at all; 4 = very much). 'Positive Relationship' (8 items) concerns the \nwarmth, level of enthusiasm and developmental appropriateness of the caregiver\u2019s interaction \nwith children (e.g. \u201cSpeaks warmly to babies and toddlers\u201d). 'Punitiveness' (6 items) refers to \nhostile, threatening, and harshly critical behaviour toward children, (e.g. \u201cSeems critical of \nbabies and toddlers\u201d). 'Detachment' (4 items) indicates the extent to which the caregiver was \nuninvolved with and uninterested in the children (e.g. \u201cSeems distant or detached from the \nbabies and toddlers\u201d). Inter-rater agreement was assessed as the agreement between a golden \nstandard and four raters of 20 child observations. The weighted mean Kappa coefficient for \neach rater with the gold standard rater ranged from .68 to .74. \n2. The Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE) was developed by the \nNICHD Early Child Care Research Network (1996) as a measure of quality of care that \nfocuses on a particular child\u2019s experiences rather than on what happens in the group as a \nwhole. The scale assesses the nuances of the caregiver\u2019s behaviour in relation to the child. \nThe FCCC shortened version (details available on request) includes eight caregiver domains \nwith items rated from 1 (not at all characteristic) to 4 (very characteristic). The separate \nscales are: sensitivity\/responsiveness to distress; sensitivity\/responsiveness to non-distress; \nintrusiveness; detachment\/disengagement; stimulation of development; positive regard for \n 15\nchild; negative regard for child; and flatness of affect. These can be added together to obtain \na total item score (see NICHD, 1996; Clarke-Stewart, 1999). The inter-rater agreement for \nthe ORCE ranged from .62 to .74.  \n3. The infant (0-3) version of The Home Observation Measurement of the Environment \n(HOME; Bradley & Caldwell, 1988) was used to rate non-maternal caregivers. The HOME \nmeasures the extent to which the home environment supports child development. All \nobservation items are dichotomous (0 = no, 1 = yes).  One subscale out of the original six, \nEmotional and Verbal Responsiveness (11 items, e.g. \u201cspontaneously praises child at least \ntwice\u201d) was used at 10 months to assess maternal and other caregiver sensitivity: Although it \nwas not designed for use in nursery settings this scale was used  as part of the interview with \nnursery carers so that there would be a measure of sensitivity comparable across all settings. \nIn settings other than nurseries the 'Avoidance of restriction and punishment' subscale (7 \nitems) was also used. At 18 months the Responsiveness and Avoidance of Restriction scale \nwas included. The mean inter-rater agreement between four independent raters and a gold \nstandard rater were Kappas between .77 and .90.  \n4. Two additional measures of quality designed specifically for formal child care settings \nwere used: The Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS; Harms & Clifford, 1984) for home-\nbased child care (Childminders) and the Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale \n(ITERS; Harms, Cryer and Clifford, 1990) for group care in nurseries. In order to produce a \nmeasure that was comparable across these two settings, items were compared and a common \nset of 8 items constructed from the Space and Furnishings subscale (4 items), the Learning \nsubscale (2 items) and the Language subscale (2 items) .  This short form combined scale had \ninternal consistency of alpha = 0.75 at 10 months and alpha = 0.61 at 18 months. The total \nmeasure was also completed in each setting so that a total mean item score could be derived.  \n 16\n5.  A reduced version of the Safety scale from the assessment profile for homes with young \nchildren, research version (Abbott-Shim & Sibley, 1993) was used to determine the level of \nsafety in home settings.  the original scale has 11 items scored yes (1) or no (0) covering the \nsafety of indoor physical space but those that could not be determined without questioning or \nmore intrusive examination (e.g. tap water 120oF or less, cleaning agents out of child's reach) \nwere excluded and 7 items were retained (e.g. heaters and fans are protected from child's \nreach or not present).   An equivalent list if items was used from the assessment profile for \nearly childhood programs (Abbott-Shim & Sibley, 1987) so that safety scores could be \ncompared across all settings. \n6.  In nurseries, a record of the numbers of children and adults who were in the room was \nmade approximately every 10 minutes. At 10 months the average number of observations was \n10.4 (N=95) and at 18 months 11.2 (N=123).  These observations were combined so that an \naverage child:staff ratio could be calculated for the relevant room in each nursery. \n7. Interviews were conducted with nursery managers at 18 months to enquire about the ages, \nqualifications and experience of their staff and data about staff qualifications, experience and \nage were aggregated at the nursery level. \n8.  Grandparents, nannies and childminders were asked whether they took the child on a list \nof 7 possible types of outing (e.g. to a library, park  or swimming pool) and the sum of these \ndichotomous items (0=no, 1=yes) were added to make a total score.  \nMaternal perceptions of child care \nAt 10 months mothers using child care were asked to indicate which three \ncharacteristics of child care out of a list of nine were the most important to them when \nselecting child care: provide professional child care; provide substitute for mother care; teach \nbabies new things; provide adequate outdoor space and toys; provide a safe physical \n 17\nenvironment; provide dependable care; provide adequate indoor space and toys; provide a \nloving and understanding environment; provide worry free child care.  \nAt 10 and 18 months mothers using non-parental care were asked to complete the \nParental Satisfaction with Child Care Scale (Harrell & Ridley, 1975),  indicating their level of \nsatisfaction with 11 different aspects of their current child care: convenience, dependability, \nprice, competence of staff\/caregivers, teaching new things, appropriate discipline, providing \nlove and understanding, nutritious food, worry free child care, baby\u2019s satisfaction with care, \nand overall quality on a 5-point scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied, 5 = extremely satisfied). \nTotal satisfaction was the average of the eleven responses; alpha = .87) (Barnes et al., 2006).  \nThis measure was introduced after the study started and in consequence the sample size (N =  \n245, 247) is smaller than those for the demographic and quality indicators. \nAnalysis \nANOVA tests were used to compare mean values of each aspect of quality in the four types \nof child care with post hoc Sheffe tests.   The frequency with which mothers deemed each of \nthe nine characteristics of child care important was calculated.  Chi Square tests were used to \ndetermine whether or not each was chosen by a similar proportion of mothers using the four \ntypes of non-maternal child care: grandparent\/relative, childminder, nanny and nursery. \nPearson correlations were calculated to determine the relationship between structural and \nregulatable indicators of child care, the mother\u2019s own behaviour and the observed quality of \nnon-maternal child care were calculated.  Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients were \ncalculated between each item ranked as one of the top three characteristics considered \nimportant by mothers and the measures of observed quality. Pearson correlation coefficients \nwere calculated between maternal satisfaction with child care and observed quality.   \nRESULTS \nComparison of observed quality  \n 18\nWhen the children were 10 months old the care observed in nursery settings was significantly \npoorer than the observed care given by grandparents, nannies or child minders, in all domains \napart from punitive behaviour (see Table 4).  Results from the Caregiver Interaction Scales \nshowed there was less positive behaviour and more detachment by adults in nurseries while \nresults from the HOME indicated less emotional responsiveness. Similarly the ORCE total \nscore indicated a lower overall quality of carer-child interactions (see Table 4). The only \nsignificant differences between the three types of home-based care was that grandparents had \na lower level of positive relationship compared to nannies and childminders. The Profile \nsafety and health scale indicated higher levels of safety, in childminders\u2019 homes that in \ngrandparents\u2019 homes or nurseries. Comparing only the two 'formal' types of child care, the \nquality of space and furnishings was better in nurseries while the level of interaction and \nactivity related to the development of language and reasoning was higher for the \nchildminders (see Table 4).  The overall total quality as indicated by the common \nITERS\/FRCRS did not reveal a significant difference between these two types of care. \nComparing only the home-based care settings, the range of activities offered was greatest by \nnannies, and least by grandparents.   \n At 18 months the picture was slightly more mixed (see Table 5). The highest level of \npositive relationships (CIS) was seen when children were with nannies, higher than between \nchildren and nursery staff and between children and grandparents. Positive relationship with \nchildminders did not differ significantly from any of the other types of care. As at 10 months, \nnursery staff were more detached than grandparents and nannies, but again childminders did \nnot differ significantly from nursery staff or from the other home-based carers.  The overall \nlevel of interactional quality (ORCE) was lower in nurseries than all the other types of care, \nand nursery staff were also judged to be lower than other types in their emotional \nresponsivity as measured by the HOME. Punitiveness was, on average, lower amongst \n 19\nchildminders than grandparents, but mean levels in the other types of setting tended to vary \nmore and neither nannies nor nursery staff differed significantly from other types of carer \n(see Table 5).   \n Comparing only childminders and nurseries, there were more learning activities in the \nnurseries (see Table 5) however the quality of the space and furnishings, and language and \nreasoning activities were now similar and the total ITERS\/FDCCRS score still did not \ndifferentiate between the types of setting. Comparing only the home-based care types, a \nsmaller range of activities was still offered by grandparents than by nannies or childminders \n(see Table 5). \nAssociations between structural features and quality of care \nAt 10 months the cost of child care was largely unrelated to the quality observed, taking all \ntypes of care together, and only one association was significant when each type is  considered \nseparately, That one significant  association  was between higher costs in nursery settings and  \nless emotional responsivity (HOME) (see Table 6).  At 18 months, higher cost in the total \nsample was associated with less punitive behaviour (CIS) and more safety overall (see Table \n6). Taking each child care type separately, there was a marginal association for nannies \nbetween higher cost and more positive interactions (CIS). For childminders, higher cost was \nassociated with marginally more positive interactions, less punitive behaviour (CIS) and \nbetter overall interactions (ORCE). \nThe average child:adult ratio was clearly associated with nursery staff behaviour (see \nTable 6).  When there were more children to each adult, staff were less positive, more \npunitive and more detached at both 10 and at 18 months, as indicated by the CIS. In addition \nat 18 months the quality of the overall interactions (ORCE) was lower when there were more \nchildren to each adult, and carers were less emotionally responsive (HOME). \n 20\nFew significant associations emerge between the ages, qualifications and experience \nof nursery staff and aspects of the care they offer, however those few significant ones are all \nin the expected direction. Nurseries with older staff scored significantly lower on detachment \n(-0.27, p<0.05) and higher on the quality of their overall interactions with children (0.38 \np<0.01). Mothers who scored more highly on avoidance of punishment were significantly \nmore likely to use nurseries with better qualified (0.27 , p<0.05) and more experienced (0.26, \np<0.05) staff. \nQualities important to mothers, type of care used and relationship to quality   \nIn Table 7 the three qualities of child care judged most desirable by all the mothers are \npresented in rank-order. The most frequently selected quality was \u201cproviding a loving and \ncaring environment\u201d (80.9%), followed by \u201cproviding a safe physical environment\u201d (67.8%) \nand \u201cproviding worry free child care\u201d (48.4%). Some of the characteristics mothers \nconsidered most desirable varied according to the type of care used. Mothers using \ngrandparents or other relatives as caregivers tended more often to say that \u201cproviding a safe \nphysical environment\u201d was an important quality of child care (p<0.10). Fewer mothers using \nother types of care, in particular fewer using nannies (51.5%) thought this an important \nquality. More mothers using childminders or nannies as caregivers  thought serving as a \n\u201csubstitute for the mother\u201d was an important quality, compared to those using other types or \nthe total group (p<.05; see Table7) while these mothers were the least likely to say that \n\u201cteaching the baby new things\u201d was an important feature of child care (p<0.10) .  \nTaking all those using child care together (N=304), there were few significant \nrelationships between the characteristics perceived as important and observed quality.  \nMaternal behaviour and observed child care quality  \nAt ten months there were few (7 out of 48 ) significant associations between behaviours \nobserved in mothers and that observed in their child's carer. When mothers were observed to \n 21\nbe more emotionally and verbally responsive (HOME), grandparents were also observed to \nbe higher on this scale (r = 0.33, p<0.01), and nursery care was likely to be marginally safer \n(r = 0.21, p<0.05).  When mothers were more likely to avoid punitive and restrictive \nbehaviour (HOME), grandparents and nannies were rated as less punitive (CIS, grandparents \nr = -0.29; nannies r = -0.60, p<0.001), the overall quality of interactions with grandparents \nwas higher (ORCE, r = 0.23, p<0.05), nannies were less detached (CIS, r = -0.33, p<0.05) \nand the environment (the child's own home) was likely to be safer (r = 0.41, p<0.05).  \nAt 18 months there were  more significant associations (10 out of 48), although again \nthese were mainly with care by grandparents or nannies. When mothers were observed as \nmore responsive (HOME) grandparents were likely to have more positive interactions (r = \n0.29, p<0.01), less detachment (CIS; r = -0.34, p<0.01),  and better interactions overall \n(ORCE; r = 0.27, p<0.05) Nannies were also higher on this scale (r = 0.33, p<0.05).  When \nmothers were more responsive, childminders were likely to be less detached (CIS, r = -0.25, \np<0.05). \nMothers more likely to avoid restriction and punishment had nannies who were less \npunitive (CIS, r = -0.47, p<0.01), more positive (CIS, r = 0.33, p<0.05) with better \ninteractions (ORCE, r = 0.39, p<0.05). Avoidance of restriction by mothers was also \nassociated in nurseries at 18 months with better interactions measured by the ORCE (r = 0.26, \np<0.01) and marginally more positive interactions (CIS, r = 0.20, p<0.05). \nAssociations between maternal satisfaction and the quality of care  \nAt both 10 and 18 months mothers\u2019 reported satisfaction with their child care was \nsignificantly associated with less observed detachment and better quality interactions as \nindicated by the ORCE, and with more responsivity as indicated by the HOME (see Table 8).    \nHowever these associations based on the total sample mask interesting differences between \nthe child care types.  Satisfaction was most closely associated with observed quality for \n 22\ngrandparent care at both 10 and 18 months, and with observed quality of childminders at 18 \nmonths. Maternal satisfaction was less strongly associated with quality of care by nannies, \nthough associations are in the same direction as for grandparents and childminders and the \ngroup sizes are small.  However maternal satisfaction is entirely unrelated to observed quality \nin nursery settings. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \nMany previous large-scale studies of child care quality have concentrated on quality-\nwithin-type as the Cost Quality and Outcomes Study (1995) concentrated exclusively on \ncentre care. Where studies have considered quality across types, notably the NICHD study of \nearly child care,  they have usually collapsed care-categories for their final analyses so that \nconclusions about relative quality can only be drawn for, say,  centre care versus all other \ntypes.  It was a main aim of this study to compare the quality of child care offered to infants \nand toddlers in a range of different types of non-parental arrangement and setting.  A four- \ntype classification, covering familial home-based care (grandparent or other relative), non-\nfamilial home-based care (nanny) in the child\u2019s own home; non-familial home-based care in \nanother home (child minder) and nursery\/centre care, and use of a battery of assessments of \nquality, most of which are comparable across all settings, has produced some interesting \nfindings.  These should be interpreted in the context of the different characteristics of the \nusers of each type of care; in particular the relative scarcity of both human and financial \ncapital amongst those using grandparent care. \nThe first research hypothesis \u2013 that quality of care would be higher in domestic-scale \nsettings with one caregiver than in group settings with several caregivers \u2013 is confirmed. \nNursery care was rated as significantly lower than any of the other three at both age points on \n 23\nall measures of the quality of inter-personal interactions except for Punitiveness, which \nshowed no significant discrimination amongst the four types at 10 months and only one at 18 \nmonths. Even comparable items from the home-based and centre-care  measure of safety and \nhealth, which might have been expected to favour the most highly regulated and inspected \ntype of care, produced significantly lower scores for nurseries at ten months than for child \nminders or grandparents.  The relatively low quality of care for very young children in \nnurseries is consistent with our previously reported finding (Barnes et al., 2006) that mothers \nof 10 month infants are less satisfied with nursery care than with any other type. \n Comparisons were made between nurseries and the other type of \u201cformal\u201d care, child \nminding (family day care) alone. Neither total scores for the separate ITERS and FDCRS, nor \na measure consisting of common items from them, discriminated between the two types of \ncare, but there were significant differences between some individual scales. At ten months the \nquality of the physical environment (space and furnishings) was better in nurseries than in \nchildminders\u2019 homes but the level of stimulating adult-child activities, that could be related to \nthe development of language and reasoning, was lower in nurseries and higher in \nchildminders\u2019 homes. At 18 months, however,  neither of these two measures discriminated \nbetween the two settings but there were more activities that might promote cognitive \ndevelopment in the nurseries. Our second hypothesis is therefore confirmed as far as it relates \nto aspects of quality reflecting caregiver sensitivity being higher in single caregiver settings, \nbut only weakly confirmed as it relates to aspects of quality relating to cognitive stimulation \nbeing higher in group care. In the light of earlier studies, including English data (see \nMelhuish, 2004) nurseries might have been expected to score significantly more highly than \nchild minders (family day care settings) on activities related to language and reasoning and to \nlearning activities at both ages. Since nurseries did provide significantly more learning \nactivities at 18 months, though not earlier, it may be that their predicted lead in the provision \n 24\nof all aspects of cognitive stimulation is age dependent and will become apparent in the \nfindings from follow-up when these children are older.  \n Within the higher overall sensitivity of adults in single-caregiver settings there were \nsome interesting differences between the three types. Grandparents, often considered by \nparents to be the ideal caregivers for such young children (Barnes et al., 2006) were observed \nto have lower levels of positive relationships with children than nannies and child minders at \nboth age points, and at 18 months they were more punitive, to a small but significant extent, \nthan child minders. Furthermore, at 10 months their homes were judged to be less safe than \nthose of childminders\u2019 and at 18 months they offered children a smaller range of outings and \nactivities than either childminders or nannies. Mothers using grandparent care  sometimes \nexpress concern about grandparents\u2019 motivation and energy for daily child care. (Leach et al., \nforthcoming), however the mothers who were using child care by grandparents were the least \nprivileged in the study. There are few, if any, non-narrative studies of nannies\u2019 behaviour or \nquality of care as this form of child care is often assumed to be confined to a very small \nminority of atypically wealthy families, and therefore not part of mainstream child care.  \nHowever daily, and sometimes shared, nanny-care is increasingly used by highly paid \nworking mothers. Nannies fared relatively well in these quality assessments, having high \nlevels of positive relationships \u2013 higher than all other caregivers at 18 months \u2013 and offering \na significantly high level of activities to their charges at both ten and eighteen months.  \n The contribution made by information on structural and regulatable features of child \ncare to assessments of quality is still open to debate. Costs of care and the relative \naffordability of different types in different locations, is an important factor in parental choice \nof care (Leach et al., forthcoming), but its relationship to the quality of that care is complex  \nand less understood, partly because the cost- data in the literature are often indirect, recording \nthe types of care used by higher and lower-earning parents, for example, rather than the \n 25\nactual costs of  child-care places.  In this study the actual monetary costs to the mother of the \ncare used at each time point was established, and shown to be largely unrelated to the \nobserved quality of care, especially in nurseries. Taking the group as a whole, mothers of 10 \nmonth babies who paid more did not get higher quality child care.   Looking at each type of \ncare in turn for this age group, there are only two significant associations between price and \nquality. The first is for childminders and relates higher cost to higher scores on safety and \nhealth. The second is for nurseries and suggests an unexpected relationship between higher \nprice paid by mothers and somewhat less responsive care received by their infants. At 18 \nmonths for the group as a whole higher cost goes with somewhat less punitiveness and very \nsignificantly higher scores on safety and health. Taking each type of care individually, \nhowever, there is no relationship between the cost of nurseries and their quality and only a \nmarginal association between the cost of nannies and more positive relationships with their \ncharges. For child minders, however, higher costs are clearly associated with measures of \nhigher quality relationships with children, including less punitiveness. These findings may \nreflect practical realities of English child care, in which the demand for privately \u2013 provided \nnursery places still outstrips demand, while child minding seeks recognition as a professional \nalternative. \n Structural features that have been most consistently found to be related to quality  \ncaregivers\u2019 qualifications, their pay and the ratios of caregivers to children, rather than those \nthat are primarily organisational, such as group and room sizes and outdoor play-space (see \nScarr et al., 1994) and as predicted in our third hypothesis that is the case here. Observed \nchild-carer ratios in the nurseries were significantly related to most of the measures of \nobserved quality of care at 10 months and almost all at 18 months. The higher the number of \n10 month infants sharing one carer, the less positive and the more punitive and detached was \nher relationship with them. In addition, at 18 months, when carers had more toddlers to care \n 26\nfor the quality of their interaction with them was significantly lower and they were less \nemotionally responsive to them. The only measure of observed quality in nurseries that was \nnot significantly related to the ratio of adults to children at 18 months was the safety and \nhealth scale. The importance of this finding is that it relates to actual ratios rather than those \ndescribed in centre brochures or on official inspection forms.  Group child care settings are \nprone to high staff turn-over and staff absence, with low levels of training, highly intensive \nwork and poor remuneration. Clearly close attention should be paid not only to who should \nbe caring for infants and toddlers but to who actually is from day to day. \n  It is suggested in the literature that parents may not know how to judge quality of \nchild care (Van Horn, 2001), are inclined to be more satisfied with their child care than its \nobserved quality merits (Cryer & Burchinal 1997) and are particularly likely to be highly \nsatisfied when the carer relates well to themselves as well as to their child (Barnes et al., \n2006). However, it has also been shown that parents\u2019 reasons for choosing particular child \ncare arrangements are important in that choice made according to quality criteria is related to \nhigher quality care than choice made according to structural or practical considerations \n(Peyton et al., 2001). While this study collected no data concerning the reasoning behind \nactual choices of child care made by mothers (but see Leach et al., forthcoming) it did collect \nan indication of the characteristics of child care they considered most important.  Asked to \nselect their top three of nine important characteristics of child care, less than 10% of mothers \nput structural characteristics (e.g. more space and play equipment) in their top three, though \nsafety was considered important.  Instead they focussed on relational characteristics such as \nthe provision of love and understanding. The rank ordering of these qualities varied \nsurprisingly little according to the type of care used except that mothers using grandparent \ncare were more likely to include \u201cproviding a safe physical environment\u201d in their top three \nwhile mothers using child minders or nannies were most likely to rank \u201cproviding substitute \n 27\nfor mother care\u201d and least likely to rank \u201cteach baby new things\u201d.  Possibly mothers paying \nindividual caregivers (who tended to be among the most highly educated) considered that the \nprime role of the caregiver was to compensate for their own absence during working hours \nand that they (and their partners) could provide all the teaching that was required.  We \npredicted that the selection of qualities mothers considered important would not be associated \nwith the observed quality of care, however a few significant associations were identified. It \nwould be interesting to extend the choice of items offered to include structural qualities \nthought to be of importance such as cost.  \nAn assessment of the quality of mothers\u2019 behaviour towards their infants was made at \nten and eighteen months. Quality of maternal care was expected to relate to the observed \nquality of her child carer but this fifth hypothesis was not confirmed. At 10 months only 7, \nand at 18 months 10, out of a possible 48 associations between mothers\u2019 and carers\u2019 \nbehaviour were significant. It is interesting, however, that almost all of these related to \ngrandparent or nanny care. In particular, the behaviour of mothers and grandparents was \nsimilar. If mothers were observed to be emotionally and verbally responsive and to avoid \nrestrictive and punitive behaviour, so did the grandparents (and nannies) who were caring for \ntheir children. It seems likely that these were modes of interaction with children taught to, or \nmodelled for, mothers by their own mothers, and insisted upon with nannies. At 18 months \nresponsive mothers also had childminders who were less detached, and avoidance of \nrestriction and punishment at home was associated with better and more positive interaction \nin nursery.  It is possible that a mother's views about punishment may be more relevant when \nselecting child care than her own sensitivity and responsiveness. \nConfirming our sixth hypothesis, and in contrast to the relative lack of relationship \nbetween maternal behaviour and child care quality, the overall relationships between \nmothers\u2019 satisfaction with care and its quality were positive for 4 out of 6 associations at 10 \n 28\nmonths and 5 out of 6 at 18 months. On first inspection these findings suggest that whatever \ntheir reasons for choosing the care they used, mothers recognised, and were significantly \nmore satisfied with, higher quality care at both age points. Significances were especially high \nat 18 months between mothers\u2019 satisfaction and caregivers\u2019 better-quality interactions, higher \nresponsivity, lesser detachment and higher safety and health scores. When each care-type is \ntaken separately, however, some interesting differences emerge, notably the lack of any \nassociation between maternal satisfaction and the observed quality of nursery care.  In this \nstudy, at ten months the \u2018whole-group\u2019 association between mothers\u2019 satisfaction and care-\nquality is carried by the observed quality of grandparent care and at eighteen months it is \ncarried by the observed quality of child minding, with the association with care by nannies \nrunning in the same direction though much less strongly. Association between maternal \nsatisfaction with care by nurseries and observed quality is non-existent.  \nAs previously reported (Barnes et al., 2006) these mothers were significantly less \nsatisfied with nursery care of 10 month babies than individual care, both formal and informal, \nwith the highest satisfaction for grandparent care.  So the fact that satisfaction with, and \nquality of care by nurseries are unrelated suggests that nurseries are somehow outside \nmothers\u2019 range of judgment. This may be because mothers have little opportunity to see what \ngoes on inside nurseries, and only a brief drop-off and collection period in which to form any \nview of the relationships between carers and their child.  On the other hand it may be that \nmothers are less inclined to look for opportunities to judge nurseries than other forms of care \nbecause they see them as scarce and desirable professional establishments where all the staff \nare trained and high standards of care can be taken for granted, a view somewhat encouraged \nby UK Government policy and investment (see Leach et al., forthcoming). Further research is \nneeded both to discover the reasons for the disassociation between maternal satisfaction and \nquality of nursery care and to explore ways in which it could be reversed. \n 29\nIt is to be hoped that further research will be able to build on the findings of this study \nand compensate for some of its limitations. Firstly, although the overall study sample for the \nFamilies, Children and Childcare study is large (1201 children), and retention has been good \n(Malmberg et al., 2006), it is a fact of English life that many infants and young toddlers do \nnot receive any non-maternal care (see Sylva et al., forthcoming). In consequence the number \nof mothers using each type of care at each of the two age points  is not large enough for all \ngroup comparisons to be robust (e.g. nannies) and it precludes consideration of further sub-\ngroups (e.g. quality by type and by gender). Secondly, the intended matching of quality of \nobserved care in nurseries with reported structural qualities proved unexpectedly difficult to \nachieve. Nursery managers were often reluctant to give the time necessary for sifting through  \npersonnel records while some individuals who were serving in managerial roles did not have \nthe authority to do so. A further difficulty was that, on one site in particular, several study \nchildren attended the same nurseries during the 4 years of data collection; although managers \nunderstood that a separate observation and interview was necessary for each child, some were \nreluctant to grant a second such visit within a few weeks . Thirdly, part of the difficulty of \nmeasuring  quality of child care is that there are few measures that can be reliably used in all \ntypes of child care setting.  In this study every effort was made to include some such \ninstruments (e.g. CIS, HOME) and we also constructed a subset of  equivalent items from the \nITERS and FDCRS so as to compare the two \u201cformal \u201c types of care \u2013 nurseries and child \nminders. Neither the original scales nor this new construction found many differences \nbetween nurseries and home-based care; more methodological developments are needed. \nConclusions \n The observed quality of non-parental child care available to infants and young toddlers \nin England varies according to child care type.  It is important to consider types of care \nseparately as well as within the whole group as this revealed some interesting and even \n 30\nunexpected relationships. Quality is lower in nurseries than in any or all of the home-based \ntypes studied at both time points , except that at 18 months and in comparison only with child \nminding, nurseries offer more learning activities. There are few differences in observed \nquality between the three types of home-based care which suggests that purchased care, such \nas that provided by registered childminders or by a nanny, can be considered as good (or in \nsome cases better) than care by a relative \u2013 sometimes seen by parents as the only type of \ncare they will countenance.   Indeed grandparents had somewhat lower levels of positive \nrelationships with children and lower safety and health scores than either child minders or \nnannies. It is important to note that mothers using grandparent care were the most \ndisadvantaged. \nAt ten months the cost of care was largely unrelated to its observed quality overall... \nTaking each type separately, more expensive nurseries were less emotionally responsive.  At \n18 months higher cost overall went with less punitiveness and greater safety while type-by-\ntype comparisons showed that paying more for child minding went with several aspects of \nhigher quality. At both ages the structural characteristic with the highest impact on the quality \nof nursery care was the ratio of children to adults: the more children each adult had to care \nfor, the lower the quality of that care. The qualities of care judged important by mothers did \nnot differ according to the type of care being used, and the observed quality of mother\u2019s \nbehaviour at 10 months was not richly associated with the observed quality of her child\u2019s care \nexcept that there was a positive association over two generations such that mothers sensitivity \nor responsiveness tended to match that of the child\u2019s grandparent.   Mothers\u2019 overall \nsatisfaction with their child care was positively associated with almost every child care \nquality variable at both 10 and 18 months. However, type by type data show that there was no \nsuch significant relationship for nurseries.  \n 31\nThere is considerable evidence in the literature and in this study of relatively poor \nquality care for infants and toddlers in nurseries, and of large variations in quality between \none nursery and another (e.g. Cost Quality and Outcomes Study Team, 1995) which \nuncritical acceptance by parents will do nothing to reverse.  Public education \u2013 perhaps \nincluding dissemination of data from official inspections \u2013 is needed to help make parents \naware of what can and should be expected of nurseries caring for very young children, and to \nencourage  parents to take an equally confident and critical approach to all types of available \nchild care: nurseries as well as relatives, nannies and child minders.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 32\nReferences \nAbbott-Shim, M. & Sibley, A.
