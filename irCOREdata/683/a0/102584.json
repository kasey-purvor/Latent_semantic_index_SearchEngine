As\nthese forces converge, the demand for new ser-\nvices, increasing bandwidth, and ubiquitous con-\nnectivity continuously grows. Next-generation\nmobile systems will be based solely (or to a great\nextent) on the IP protocol.\nThe aim of this convergence is to offer seam-\nless multimedia services to mobile\/wireless IP-\nbased hosts across a variety of heterogeneous\naccess technologies \u2014 Universal Mobile\nTelecommunications System (UMTS) radio\naccess network (UTRAN), wireless LANs\n(WLANs), and emerging fourth-generation (4G)\nsystems, for example \u2014 meeting the demands of\nboth enterprise and public environments, any-\nwhere and anytime [3]. As an effect, the all-IP\nnetwork concept leads these developments and\ninvestigates their impact on the provisioning of\nreal-time and non-real-time multimedia services,\nsuch as mobile telephony, multimedia conferenc-\ning, or mobile Web access in ubiquitous environ-\nments [1, 2].\nNot too long ago, communications meant\nvoice and mobility meant cellular. But today we\nsee that subscribers are increasingly relying on\ndiverse communications solutions for a complex\narray of voice, data, and multimedia needs,\nmany of which are being addressed by Internet\/\nintranet connected network (e.g. in offices,\nhomes, shopping areas, and transport facilities).\nWhat is missing is an overlying strategy for inte-\ngration of these disparate solutions into what\nfrom the customers\u2019 perspective would appear as\na single fabric. The core components for this\nintegration strategy include cross-network and\ncross-service solutions for mobility, authentica-\ntion, subscriber administration, and consolidated\naccounting and billing. These are all elements\nthat today\u2019s cellular world offers better than any-\nbody, but only for itself. The opportunity for the\ncellular community is to broaden its focus and\nassociations by extending these core services to\nenterprise networks, Internet service providers\n(ISPs), public access hot spots such as airports\nand shopping malls, and private hot spots, such\nas home networks. It is foreseen that a family of\nseamless mobility handsets operating simultane-\nously in both cellular and WLAN environments\nwill appear in the market.\nMobile IP (MIP) is the current standard for\nsupporting the mobility of mobile users [4].\nHowever, MIP exhibits several drawbacks. It is\nnot efficient to handle local mobility of users in\nlimited areas such as subnets [5, 6]. MIP also\nstruggles with the problem of triangular routing,\nwhich introduces delay to the traffic toward a\nmobile host (MH), but not to that originated\nfrom the MH. For delay-sensitive traffic (e.g.,\nVoIP or streaming multimedia services) this is\nnot acceptable, due to the high latency in the\nnetwork. Route optimization solves this prob-\nlem, but on the other hand requires modifica-\ntions to the IP stack of the end hosts.\nCHRISTOS POLITIS, KAR ANN CHEW, NADEEM AKHTAR, MICHAEL GEORGIADES, AND\nRAHIM TAFAZOLLI, UNIVERSITY OF SURREY\nTASOS DAGIUKLAS, AEGEAN UNIVERSITY\nABSTRACT\nThis article presents a multilayer mobility\nmanagement scheme for All-IP networks where\nlocal mobility movements (micro-mobility) are\nhandled separately from global movements\n(macro-mobility). Furthermore, a hybrid scheme\nis proposed to handle macro-mobility (Mobile IP\nfor non-real-time services and SIP for real-time\nservices). The interworking between micro-\nmobility and macro-mobility is implemented at\nan entity called the enhanced mobility gateway.\nBoth qualitative and quantitative results have\ndemonstrated that the performance of the pro-\nposed mobility management is better than exist-\ning schemes. Furthermore, a context transfer\nsolution for AAA is proposed to enhance the\nmultilayer mobility management scheme by\navoiding the additional delay introduced by\nAAA security procedures.\nHYBRID MULTILAYER MOBILITY MANAGEMENT\nWITH AAA CONTEXT TRANSFER CAPABILITIES FOR\nALL-IP NETWORKS\nThis article presents a\nmultilayer mobility\nmanagement scheme for\nAll-IP Networks where\nlocal mobility move-\nments (micromobility)\nare handled separately\nfrom global movements\n(macromobility). \nA hybrid scheme is also\nproposed to handle\nmacromobility.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Apart from MIP,\nthere are other outstanding solutions that sup-\nport domain-based mobility [6]. The Session Ini-\ntiation Protocol (SIP) [7] is an emerging protocol\ndesigned to provide basic call control and appli-\ncation-layer signaling for voice and multimedia\nsessions in a packet-switched network. Several\nwireless technical fora, such as the Third Gener-\nation Partnership Project (3GPP), 3GPP2, and\nMobile Wireless Internet Forum (MWIF), have\nagreed on SIP utilization to provide session\nmanagement and means of personal as well as\nservice mobility. The main characteristics of SIP\nare its simplicity and extensibility, scalability and\nefficiency, and its inherent support of personal\nmobility.\nThis article proposes a solution to handle\nmacro-mobility using a hybrid scheme (SIP for\nreal-time and MIP for non-real-time mobile\ncommunications), while mobility within the sub-\nnet area is handled by a micro-mobility protocol.\nThe proposed mobility management scheme is\nverified and validated through both qualitative\nand quantitative (simulation results) analysis.\nFurthermore, a context scheme is proposed to\nsupport context transfer for AAA information in\norder to enhance the multilayer mobility man-\nagement scheme. The introduction of a context\ntransfer scheme aims to alleviate the additional\ndelay introduced by authorization, authenticaion,\nand accounting (AAA) security procedures.\nThis article is organized as follows. We illus-\ntrate all-IP network architecture characteristics,\nand outline the requirements for mobility man-\nagement in all-IP networks; we present the gen-\neral characteristics of the proposed mobility\nmanagement framework associated with func-\ntional operation, qualitative evaluation, and per-\nformance evaluation through simulation; we\npresent the context transfer scheme for convey-\ning AAA information while the user hands off\nhorizontally and vertically, and we draw conclu-\nsions.\nALL-IP NETWORK ARCHITECTURES\nWith 3G systems just beginning to be deployed,\nit is necessary to consider how they will evolve to\ninclude a much wider range of users, applica-\ntions, and economic development. There is no\nindustry consensus on what systems beyond 3G\nwill look like but, as far as the next-generation\nnetworks are concerned, ideas and concepts\ninclude [2, 3, 8]:\n\u2022 Transition to an all-IP network infrastructure\n\u2022 Support of heterogeneous wireless access tech-\nnologies, such as UTRAN, WLANs, wireless\npersonal area networks (WPANs), and 3G.\n\u2022 Seamless handovers across both homogeneous\nand heterogeneous wireless technologies\n\u2022 Mobility and quality of service (QoS) support\nat or above the IP layer\n\u2022 Deployment of new protocols for services such\nas AAA (e.g., DIAMETER) and their inter-\nworking with existing technologies, such as the\nhome\/visited location register (HLR\/VLR)\nand Mobile Application Part (MAP) in Global\nSystem for Mobile Communications (GSM),\nand Remote Authentication Dial-In User Ser-\nvice (RADIUS) in the Internet\n\u2022 Support of different types of mobility (termi-\nnal, session and personal mobility)\n\u2022 Mechanisms to support service roaming and\nservice access while users move\n\u0002 Figure 1.

The main argument that\nleads toward such an integrated approach is\ntwofold: support of innovative applications to\ngenerate new revenues, and a common transport\ntechnology to reduce costs. Considering that the\nentire telecommunications industry is funded out\nof the end user\u2019s pocket, it is straightforward\nthat the future growth of this industry must\nensure that end user\u2019s satisfaction is enriched\nwith new services, that can be offered \u201canytime,\nanywhere, and anyhow.\u201d\nMOBILITY MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS IN\nALL-IP NETWORKS\nThe most important requirements regarding\nmobility management of next-generation all-IP\nnetworks are the following [5, 9]:\nSupport of different types of mobility:\n\u2022 Terminal mobility: An end user\u2019s ability to use\nher\/his own terminal regardless of location\nand the ability of the network to maintain the\nuser\u2019s ongoing communication as she\/he roams\nacross heterogeneous radio cells in either the\nsame or different administrative domains.\n\u2022 Service mobility: The end user\u2019s ability to main-\ntain ongoing sessions and obtain services\ntransparently. The service mobility includes\nthe ability of the home service provider to\neither maintain control of the services it pro-\nvides to the user in the visited network, or\ntransfer their control to the visited network.\n\u2022 Personal mobility: The ability of end users to\ninitiate and receive calls, and access sub-\nscribed network services on any terminal at\nany location in a transparent manner, and the\nability of the network to identify end users as\nthey move across administrative domains.\nHierarchical topology: This delineates the\nseparation of global from local mobility. The\nterm global mobility refers to the movement of\nmobile hosts across different networks\/domains\n(interdomain mobility), whereas the term local\nmobility is used to describe the movement within\na specific subnet. For local (intradomain) mobili-\nty, it is important to differentiate active from idle\nsystems to improve performance and scalability.\nMultilayer mobility: Currently, the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF) is standardizing\nthe Mobile IP protocol to support dynamic\nmobility across Internet domains for MHs. There\nare two variations of MIP for IPv4 and IPv6 net-\nworks, respectively [10, 11]. However, MIP is\nstruggling with the problem of triangular rout-\ning, which adds delay to the traffic toward an\nMH, but not that from the MH. For delay-sensi-\ntive traffic (e.g., voice or multimedia over IP)\nthis is not acceptable, due to the high latency in\nthe network. MIP route optimization solves this\nproblem, but on the other hand requires modifi-\ncations in the IP stack of the end hosts [12]. To\nalleviate the problems associated with MIP,\napplication layer mobility is proposed, by using\nthe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). SIP [7] is\nan emerging protocol, designed to provide basic\ncall control and application-layer signaling for\nvoice and multimedia sessions in a packet-\nswitched network. Supporting both real-time and\nnon-real-time multimedia applications in a\nmobile environment may require mobility aware-\nness on or above the IP layer in order to utilize\nknowledge about the traffic type. Several wire-\nless technical fora (e.g., 3GPP, 3GPP2, MWIF)\nhave agreed on SIP utilization to provide session\nmanagement and a means of personal as well as\nservice mobility.\nThe main features of SIP-based terminal\nmobility (Fig. 2) are the following:\n\u2022 No permanent addresses are required for\nMHs. Collocated care-of addresses on each\nlink are used during the registration process at\neach domain (e.g., through DHCP server).\n\u2022 There is no modification of the IP protocol\nstack of the end hosts.\n\u2022 It alleviates the problem of triangular routing.\n\u2022 It inherently supports personal mobility.\nHowever, SIP-based mobility management\napplies only to real-time communications over\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP); it breaks TCP\nconnections (transparent terminal mobility is not\nsupported). Supporting terminal mobility for\nTCP with SIP requires a tracking agent on every\nMH that maintains a record of its ongoing TCP\nconnections, as well as IP encapsulation capabili-\nties on each correspondent host (CH) [13].\nThis multilayer approach can be a complete\nmobility management framework by employing\nprotocols such as HAWAII, Cellular IP, or Hier-\narchical MIP to support local or micro-mobility.\nTHE PROPOSED MOBILITY\nMANAGEMENT SCHEME\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\nThis article proposes a multilayer mobility man-\nagement scheme where macro-mobility is sepa-\nrated and handled differently than\n\u0002 Figure 2.

The macromobility is based on\nthe use of a hybrid and multiprotocol scheme, by\nfollowing a multilayer and multiprotocol\napproach. Since there is no macromobility proto-\ncol that can meet the requirements of different\ntypes of services (i.e., loss for non-real-time ser-\nvices such as FTP or HTTP and delay for real-\ntime services such as voice and multimedia), a\nhybrid solution is proposed that is based on the\nsynergy, and extraction of the advantages, of\nexisting protocols such as MIP and SIP. In the\nproposed scheme, SIP signaling is used to sup-\nport interdomain mobility for real-time traffic\n(mainly Real-Time Transport Protocol, RTP,\nover UDP), while MIP applies to non-real-time\ntraffic. The synergy between the two protocols is\naccomplished at the edge between the core and\naccess networks at an entity called the Enhanced\nMobility Gateway (EMG). Traffic from\/toward\nan MH is separated on the domain edge routers,\nas illustrated in Fig. 3.\nNetwork Address Translation (NAT) is\nrequired on the EMG, since MHs can be identi-\nfied by their private home addresses within\nmicro-mobility areas, depending on the micro-\nmobility protocol used (i.e., candidate protocols\nsuch as Cellular IP, HAWAII, and Hierarchical\nMIP). Following this approach, the IP encapsu-\nlation requirement on the end hosts is avoided.\nThe employment of MIP foreign agents (FAs) at\nEMGs requires seamless interworking of MIP\nFAs with any micro-mobility modules (i.e., Cel-\nlular IP-CIP gateway, Hierarchical MIP-MAP).\nAs mentioned previously, MIP supports macro-\nmobility for non-real-time traffic (e.g., TCP),\nwhich bypasses the NAT. This traffic is routed\ntoward the MH through its home network using\ntunneling. The overhead introduced by IP-in-IP\nencapsulation is not as critical for this type of\napplication.\nHowever, macro-mobility for real-time traffic\n(i.e., real-time services) is supported with SIP\nsignaling, as described in the previous section.\nThe use of NAT for real-time traffic introduces\nproblems involving blocking of the end-to-end\ncommunication because the voice and video\ndevices behind the NAT have private IP address-\nes that are not routable outside their local\ndomain or on the public Internet. This is due to\nthe embodiment of the IP address of the calling\nend host in voice over IP (VoIP) signaling mes-\nsages (e.g., H.323\/H.225-H.245, MGCP, SIP)\n[14]. The problem of SIP NAT traversal is under\ninvestigation within the IETF. A number of solu-\ntions have been proposed: Simple Traversal of\nUDP through NAT (STUN), Traversal Using\nRelay NAT (TURN), SIP application layer gate-\nways, MIDCOM protocol, and SDP extensions\nfor NAT. Without loss of generality, the STUN\napproach has been chosen due to its simplicity in\nterms of implementation and its design method-\nology that does not require any modifications to\nthe SIP servers. STUN allows entities (i.e., SIP\nclients) behind a NAT to first discover the pres-\nence and type of NAT, and then learn the\naddress bindings allocated by the NAT [15].\nOn the other hand, mobility within a subnet\narea can be supported by a candidate micro-\nmobility protocol. Several candidate micro-\nmobility protocols have been proposed within\nthe IETF (i.e., Cellular IP, HAWAII, Hierarchi-\ncal Mobile IP, etc.) [16]. The integration between\nmacro-mobility protocols (SIP and MIP) and\nmicro-mobility protocols is accomplished\nthrough the EMG.\nIn the IETF the Seamoby working group\n(WG) is currently designing protocols that will\nallow real-time services to work with minimal\ndisruption across heterogeneous wireless and\nwireline access technologies. Furthermore, IETF\nSeamoby WG is currently standardizing proto-\ncols for:\n\u2022 Transferring state information between edge\nmobility devices (context transfer)\n\u2022 Discovering candidate access routers upon\nhandoff (handoff candidate discovery)\n\u2022 Supporting IP paging (dormant mode host\nalerting)\nThe main functionalities that could be sup-\nported by an IP micro-mobility protocol (as\ndefined by IETF Seamoby WG) include but are\nnot limited to IP paging, context transfer, and\nsoft handoffs. For more information about the\ndifferent micro-mobility protocols, and their\ncomparisons can be found at [16].\nWithout loss of generality, this article is\nfocused on the Cellular IP micromobility proto-\ncol. Cellular IP (CIP) has been proposed as an\nefficient protocol to support intradomain mobili-\nty to an MIP-enabled Internet. Some of the fea-\ntures of CIP include host-based routing, passive\nconnectivity, paging, distributed location\ndatabase, and use of home address to identify\nMHs [16, 17]. Moreover, CIP has been further\nenhanced with IPv6 capabilities and mechanisms\nthat make the handover seamless and more effi-\ncient. Such capabilities include the use of IPv6\nextension headers for transferring control infor-\nmation, route optimization, and the use of the\nIPv6 stateless autoconfiguration feature [18].\nFUNCTIONAL OPERATION\nTraffic (i.e., TCP for non-real-time traffic and\nUDP for real-time traffic) from\/toward an MH\nis separated on the EMG. The MHs are identi-\nfied with their private home addresses within the\n\u0002 Figure 3.

This provides location pri-\nvacy and application transparency, while the MH\nroams across a visited domain.\nThe seamless interworking of MIP with the\nCIP is accomplished within the EMG. As men-\ntioned previously, MIP supports macro-mobili-\nty for non-real-time traffic (e.g., TCP), which\nbypasses the NAT. This traffic will be routed\ntoward the MH through the use of tunneling.\nThe smooth interworking between SIP and\nCIP necessitates the definition of a new type\nof control information in CIP route\/paging-\nupdate packets: the SIP user identifier. It is an\nemail-like address of the form user@host ,\nwhere user is  a user name and host is  a\ndomain name or numerical address. This infor-\nmation is inserted in the payload of the first\nroute-update packet after handoff and may be\nrepeated in a few subsequent route\/paging-\nupdate packets for reliability. Upon receiving\nthe first route-update packet, the CIP gateway\n(CIP GW) performs admission control to reg-\nister the corresponding host at its caches (local\nregistration).\nIf the mobile host moves during a session, the\nSIP user agent (UA) sends a SIP re-INVITE\nrequest message to each of its CHs. In this mes-\nsage, the MH includes its original SIP user iden-\ntifier in the from field of the SIP header. It also\nincludes the GW\u2019s address in:\n\u2022 The Contact field of the SIP header, in order\nto inform the CH where it wants to receive\nfuture SIP messages\n\u2022 The c (connection) field of the SDP header\nthat contains a description of the session, in\norder to redirect the data traffic flow toward\nits new location\nThe CIP GW acts as the point where SIP\nresponses will reach. Furthermore, the CIP GW\nis equipped with a SIP message tracking agent in\norder to forward the SIP responses to their orig-\ninal destination, the CIP GW. This agent checks\nthe CIP GW\u2019s binding caches to determine\nwhether a SIP response message must be for-\nwarded toward a registered MH. This forward-\ning is accomplished after the destination IP\naddress has been modified. This ensures that the\naforementioned SIP re-INVITE transaction is\ncorrectly completed upon handoff. Upon recep-\ntion of the SIP INVITE message by the CH, IP\nencapsulation is used to forward data informa-\ntion toward the MH. The encapsulated data\npackets are captured by the CIP GW, which in\nturn decapsulates and forwards them to the\nrecipient MH, following the CIP routing scheme.\nData traffic from the MH is regularly routed\nwithout the use of tunneling. The MH completes\nthe handoff by sending a SIP Register message\ntoward a SIP server on its home network (home\nregistration) (Fig. 4).\nFigure 5 illustrates the signaling exchanged\nbetween two mobile nodes using the hybrid pro-\nposed nobility management scheme; one that sup-\nports real-time traffic and one that supports\nnon-real-time traffic. Furthermore, in this scenario\nwe use the NAT\/STUN functionalities, which\nincrease the overall signaling load. The main\nadvantages of the proposed hybrid mobility man-\nagement include the removal of tunneling (MIP\nfeatures), which is quite vital for real-time services.\nQUALITY EVALUATION\nTable 1 illustrates the main characteristics of the\nproposed schemes against other existing mobility\nmanagement approaches. Similar to MIP, the\nproposed scheme supports transparent terminal\nmobility. However, unlike MIP, this scheme sup-\nports optimized routing, personal and session\nmobility, fast handoffs, and paging. The only dif-\nference between the proposed scheme and SIP-\nbased mobility management is that the SIP-based\nmobility management architecture requires mod-\nifications in the IP stack of end hosts to support\nIP-in-IP encapsulation, and thus, similar to the\nMIP route optimization option, it will experience\nproblems gaining wide acceptance.\n\u0002 Figure 4.

The main\nemphasis has been placed on the hybrid macro-\nmobility scheme (MIP vs. SIP), which greatly\naffects the overall performance. The perfor-\nmance and comparisons of different micro-mobil-\nity schemes is outside the scope of this article.\nMore information about the performance of\nmicro-mobility protocols can be found at [16, 19].\nThe Simulation Environment \u2014 In order to evaluate\nthe proposed mobility management architecture,\nwe selected a set of simulation scenarios that\nconsider the performance of real-time and non-\nreal-time applications using the proposed mobili-\nty management against standardized solutions\n(MIP). Therefore, we split the mobility domains\nin two: the first is SIP-based, where real-time\napplications are treated; the second is MIP-\nbased, where non-real-time applications are tar-\ngeted.\nThe scenario in Table 2 was considered for\nthis simulation set.\n\u0002 Figure 5.

In the above scenario, the\nMH is relatively static. As is shown, the PLR\nfor MIP is higher than that of SIP for two dif-\nferent types of multimedia applications (stream-\ning application with tpo = 1 s and voice\napplication tpo = 0.5 s). However, it must be\nemphasized that for real-time applications per-\nformance can be affected by other factors such\nas wireless link delay, DHCP, security, and\nAAA operation.\nIn Fig. 7, as the handoff interval increases\n(the MH performs handoff regularly), the PLR\nfor MIP marginally increases only as handoff\nfrequency increases. On the other hand, SIP is\nmore sensitive to packet loss increases for both\nfull hand off and half hand off scenarios. In the\nhalf handoff scenario, RTP is resumed at the\nSIP MH when the SIP OK message is received\nfrom the CH, without waiting for reception of\nthe SIP-Re-register-OK signaling flow from\nthe home registrar. In the full handoff, the SIP\nMH resumes RTP after the SIP OK is received\nfrom the CH and home registrar. From these\ntwo figures, it is shown that SIP gives better\nperformance for static MHs, while MIP gives\nbetter performance for MHs with frequent\nmovement.\nFigure 8 illustrates the impact of mean Inter-\nnet delay on the service disruption (RTP stop\ntime) due to handoff for both full and half hand-\noff. It is shown that disruption time is lower for\nMIP than SIP for both half and full handoff.\nThis is due to the separate address acquisition\nduring SIP-based handoff. There are several\nmessages exchanged during this procedure, and\nthe MH starts to send handoff messages only\nafter completing this procedure.\nThe Impact of Mobility Management Schemes on the Per-\nformance of Non-Real-Time Services \u2014 Figures 9 and\n10 illustrate the TCP congestion window and\nreceived TCP segment numbers for both MIP\nand SIP mobility management schemes. Because\nof triangular routing in MIP, SIP performs bet-\nter than MIP. However, both MIP and SIP\n\u0002 Figure 7.

The former uses tunneling\nfrom the home agent (HA) to the MH, while the\nlatter employs tunneling from the CH to the\nMH.\nThe above have been observed by varying the\nparameters of non-real-time applications, as\nshown in Table 3 and Fig. 11.\nThe main reasons for SIP\u2019s better perfor-\nmance are the following:\n\u2022 All CHs interpret SIP messages.\n\u2022 All CHs perform IP encapsulation.\n\u2022 Support from TCP tracking (to allow TCP ses-\nsion to continue).\n\u2022 Support from the application layer.\n\u2022 Cross-layer cooperation is needed between\nSIP, TCP, IP, and perhaps the OS of the MH.\nMIP performs better when the triangular\nproblem is treated. Therefore, a complete and\nhighly efficient mobility approach\/framework is\nto split mobility support: use MIP for non-real-\ntime services and SIP for real-time applications.\nAAA CONTEXT TRANSFER FOR\nSEAMLESS AND SECURE HANDOVERS\nFrom a handoff performance perspective, one\nof the key issues in the development of the pro-\nposed multilayer mobility management scheme\nis the minimization of handoff delay when an\nMH roams across homogeneous\/heterogeneous\nnetworks. The introduction of AAA functionali-\nties adds an undesired delay component while\nthe user requests network access and at the\nsame time hands off. The delay time introduced\nby AAA transactions adds to the handoff laten-\ncy and consequently affects ongoing sessions.\nDuring handoff, interactions between the MH\nand AAA servers must be avoided or at the\nvery least reduced. Therefore, one of the main\nobjectives is to minimize and if possible elimi-\nnate the additional delay introduced by AAA\nprocedures.\nContext transfer could facilitate this by for-\nwarding the AAA pre-established information\nto the new access router (as shown in Fig. 12).\nIn this article a context transfer solution is\nproposed for transferring AAA state informa-\ntion from the old access router to the new\naccess router (nAR). The motivation for this\nstems from the benefits of avoiding re-estab-\nlishment of AAA and providing an interopera-\nble solution that works for any layer 2 radio\naccess technology. This solution contributes to\nthe seamless operation of application streams,\nminimizes packet loss, reduces delay, saves on\nbandwidth over the radio link, and reduces\nerrors.\nAN OVERVIEW OF AUTHENTICATION IN\nWIRELESS NETWORKS\nWLANs authenticate mobile users according to\nthe IEEE 802.1x standards [20].

The AAA client is\naware only of when the EAP authentication\nprocess starts and ends. EAP is a transport\nprotocol used by different authentication types\nknown as EAP methods. Among the EAP\nmethods developed specifically for wireless\nnetworks, a family of methods based on public\nkey certificates and the TLS protocol is includ-\ned. These are EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and\nPEAPP. Without loss of generality, the EAP-\nTLS method is considered [21]. There are two\nmain elements associated with the EAP-TLS\nprotocols:\n\u2022 EAP [21] allows wireless client adapters to\ncommunicate with different back-end servers,\nsuch as RADIUS or DIAMETER. Without\nloss of generality, RADIUS has been chosen\n[22].\n\u2022 IEEE 802.1x, a standard for port-based net-\nwork access control. EAP-TLS was the chosen\nprotocol as it is 802.1x\/EAP compliant, and\nsupports mutual authentication and dynamic\nWired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which are\nessential for WLAN networks [23].\nIn brief the following steps take place in the\nEAP-TLS protocol:\n\u2022 A mobile client requires a valid certificate to\nauthenticate to a mobile WLAN network.\n\u2022 The AAA server requires a server certificate\nto validate its identity to the clients.\n\u2022 The certificate-authority-server infrastructure\nissues certificates to the AAA server(s) and\nclients.\nThe components involved in the 802.1x\/EAP\nauthentication process are the following:\n\u2022 Supplicant (mobile user)\n\u2022 Authenticator (access point)\n\u2022 Authentication server (RADIUS server)\n\u2022 The authenticator must support 802.1x\/EAP\nauthentication, and the supplicant and authen-\ntication server must support EAP\/TLS authen-\ntication.\n\u0002 Table 3.

The\ncontext information will be stored at the CIP-\nGW, with a copy of this context (state informa-\ntion) forwarded to the NBS [23] (Fig. 13).\nOne of the main advantages of using CIP is\nthe distinction it makes between idle and active\nusers. This separation allows the network to fol-\nlow a MH in active state from BS to BS and\ndeliver packets without searching for the MH.\nBy separating the caches for active and idle\nMHs, only a smaller cache need be searched for\nmost of the packets, which results in faster\nlookups and better scalability. This CIP advan-\ntage of separating active hosts from idle MHs is\nalso a benefit to the context transfer mechanism\nsince it also targets active MHs.\nIn order to incorporate the above context\ntransfer mechanism into the CIP protocol the\nfollowing enhancements have been made [24]:\n\u2022 Introduction of a context-update (CU) packet\n\u2022 Introduction of a context cache at each CIP\nleaf node and the gateway\n\u2022 Augment the cellular-IP route-update packet\nwith a flag to indicate handoff\nFor interdomain handoff:\n\u2022 Introduction of a context-update request (CU-\nReq) packet\n\u2022 Introduction of a context-update reply (CU-\nRep) packet\nTHE AAA CONTEXT TRANSFER SOLUTION\nAs mentioned earlier, this article proposes an\nAAA context transfer solution for transferring\nAAA state information stored at the CIP-GW to\nthe MH\u2019s NBS after handoff takes place. Figure\n14 shows a signaling flow diagram of the EAP-\nTLS message exchanges after handoff between\nthe MH, the NBS, and the RADIUS server in\nthe absence of the context transfer solution. As\nshown, multiple message exchanges are required\nbetween these entities before the MH is autho-\nrized to access the network. This delay could be\nvery large, especially if the RADIUS server\nresides far away from the NBS; hence, it must be\navoided.\nFigure 15 shows the messaging flow when the\nAAA context transfer solution is used. It clearly\nshows how the number of message exchanges is\nreduced and how communication with the\nRADIUS server is avoided.\nINTRADOMAIN CONTEXT TRANSFER SETUP\nThe performance of the proposed context trans-\nfer scheme was evaluated in a wireless network-\ning testbed (WNT). Figure 16 illustrates the\nhardware configuration for the intradomain\nsetup in the testbed. The EMG is running on a\nLinux PC. There are two CIP nodes running on\nLinux laptops in the setup. We are using the\nopen source CIP implementation from Columbia\nUniversity [25]. They have two network inter-\nfaces, one wired and one wireless. The wired\ninterface is used to connect to the gateway, while\nthe wireless interface serves as the AP. The AP\nis simply a Linksys WPC11 wireless card with the\nopen source hostAP driver (hostap-0.0.3). The\nMH is a Linux laptop equipped with a wireless\nnetwork interface card. The gateway is connect-\ned to the backbone via a Cisco Catalyst switch.\nHandoff is initiated from the mobile node by\nsending a route-update packet toward the EMG\n(see Fig. 16). When an active node connects to\nan NBS, it transmits a route-update packet to\n\u0002 Figure 13.

The route-update packet will update\nroute caches in nodes along the way from the\nNBS to the EMG. A new flag is introduced,\ncalled the H (handoff) flag, in the route-update\npacket. When the route-update packet reaches\nthe EMG, if the H flag is enabled, the EMG will\nsend a CU packet toward the mobile node. The\nCU packet, carrying the feature contexts, will be\nrouted along the reverse path on a hop-by-hop\nbasis toward the mobile node. When the CU\narrives at the NBS, the NBS stores the context\ndata in its context cache and discards the packet.\nHaving received the AAA related data corre-\nsponding to the MH, the BS then authenticates\nthe MH straightaway without waiting for the\nhost to initiate the complete EAP-TLS messages\nexchange.\nINTERDOMAIN CONTEXT TRANSFER SETUP\nThe setup for interdomain context transfer\nscheme evaluation is shown in Fig. 17. In this\ncase, there are two EMGs running on Linux\nPCs. Furthermore, each EMG is connected to a\nCIP node on the downlink. Also, the gateway is\nconnected to the backbone through a Cisco Cat-\nalyst switch. The leaf nodes are the same as the\nones used for the intradomain case. Because this\nsetup is to be used for handoffs between\ndomains, the two gateways are on different sub-\nnets, as illustrated in Fig. 17.\nThis is similar to the intradomain process\nwith additional messages to request and forward\nthe desired context information from the previ-\nous EMG (PEMG) to the new EMG (NEMG).\nWhen an active node connects to an NBS, it\ntransmits a route-update packet to NEMG.\nWhen the route-update packet reaches the\nNEMG, if the H flag is enabled and identifies\nthe MH as a newcomer to its domain, it requests\nthe context information from the PEMG by\nsending a CT-Req packet. On reception of the\nCT-Req, the PEMG forwards the context infor-\nmation to the NEMG using a CT-Rep message.\nThe NEMG in turn stores the context at the\ncontext cache and creates a CU packet contain-\ning the context. The CU packet, carrying the\nfeature contexts, will be routed along the reverse\npath on a hop-by-hop basis toward the mobile\nnode. When the CU arrives at the NBS, the\nNBS stores the context data in its context cache\nand discards the packet. As for intradomain\nhandoff, the new BS authenticates the MH on\nthe basis of the received context and hence\navoids the delay due to the EAP-TLS message\nexchange.\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATION [26]\nTable 4 shows the EAP\/TLS packets captured at\nthe MH during the authentication procedure\nwhen an interdomain handoff takes place. For\nthis set of observations, the context transfer has\nbeen disabled; therefore, full re-authentication is\nrequired. The handoff is initiated by the CIP\nroute-update packet with the H flag set (packet\n1 in the figure). The re-authentication process is\ninitiated with an EAPOL Start message sent by\nthe MH to the new AP (AP2), while successful\nauthentication is indicated by the EAPOL Suc-\ncess message. Using the timestamps associated\nwith these two messages, we can find out the\n\u0002 Figure 16.

The\ntime difference between the CIP route-update\npacket and the EAP Success packet is used to\ndetermine the time taken for the handoff from\none BS to another and the subsequent re-authen-\ntication.\nAltogether the handoff delay is about 8 s,\nwhich demonstrates that the EAP\/TLS exchange\nis a significant delay component in this scenario.\nIn contrast, Table 5 shows the handoff delay\nresulting when the context transfer mechanism is\nenabled. For this scenario the MH moves from\nAP2 back to AP1. As can be seen in the table,\nthe handoff delay has been significantly reduced\nto only approximately 0.4 ses. In this case, again\nthe route-update (with H flag set) indicates the\nhandoff, and then the context transfer takes\nplace between the new and previous gateways,\nfollowed by the \u201creduced\u201d re-authentication pro-\ncedure based on the received context.\nFinally, the NBS (AP1) informs the MH that\nit has been successfully authenticated by sending\nthe EAP Success message as indicated in Table\n5. It is important to note that the improvement\nis almost 10 times. We have repeated this test a\nnumber of times, and it has been observed that\nalthough the actual times vary, context transfer\nenabled handoff is much faster than that without\ncontext transfer.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis article presents a mobility management\nframework that can efficiently handle real-time\nservices in all-IP networks. The presented frame-\nwork proposes use of a hybrid scheme to handle\nmacro-mobility (MIP for non-real-time services\nand SIP for real-time services). Interworking\nbetween micro-mobility and macro-mobility is\nimplemented at an entity called the enhanced\nmobility gateway. Simulation results have shown\nthat SIP is not worse than MIP for handling\nmacro-mobility. For real-time applications\n(RTP\/UDP-based) SIP performs better than\nMIP, while for non-real-time applications (TCP-\nbased), SIP performs better under the following\nconditions: all CHs interpret SIP messages; all\nCHs perform IP encapsulation; support from\nTCP tracking (to allow a TCP session to contin-\nue), support from the application layer, and\ncross-layer cooperation are needed between SIP,\nTCP, IP, and perhaps the OS of the MH. There-\nfore, a hybrid solution is proposed to handle\nglobal mobility (SIP and MIP) together with the\ncandidate local mobility protocol (CIP).\nFurthermore, an innovative context transfer\nsolution has been proposed to complement mul-\ntilayer mobility management with the objective\nof avoiding the additional delay introduced by\nAAA operation. For this solution existing mes-\nsages of CIP were used as triggers, and addition-\nal messages were introduced to carry the AAA\ncontext information to the appropriate base sta-\ntion. Based on the results shown here, the pro-\nposed AAA context transfer solution reduces the\noverall handoff delay by a factor of 20. This is\nbecause the full EAP\/TLS procedure is avoided\nby transferring the AAA context to the new BS,\nthus enabling it to re-authenticate the MH with-\nout contacting the AAA server. This work\ndemonstrates how the context transfer mecha-\nnism improves the overall handoff performance\nand hence aids in realizing seamless and secure\nmobility management in all IP infrastructures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been performed in the framework\nof the IST-2001-32449 project EVOLUTE, which\nis partly funded by the European Union.
