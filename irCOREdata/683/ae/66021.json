Concepts of liminality come particularly to the fore where headlands and \nislands are selected as places for the disposal of human remains. The density of \nchambered tombs recorded by Du Ch\u00e2tellier  on the islands of the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago, \nwith its rocks, inlets and small islands exposed and covered by the tides, provides a \nprominent example of this coastal emphasis. The analysis presented here includes \nassessment of the reliability of the Du Ch\u00e2tellier inventory and of the topographic \nchanges resulting from sea-level rise. It is argued that the dramatic transformative effect \nof the tides on the shallow waters of this archipelago will have enhanced the liminality of \nthe setting and may have endowed the islands with special mythological or symbolic \nassociations that may explain the density of the monuments. Ethnographic accounts of \ncoastal beliefs from North America and northern Europe provide additional indications of \nthe likely symbolic importance of such shoreline settings for Breton Neolithic \ncommunities. \n \nLa r\u00e9partition littorale des monuments fun\u00e9raires n\u00e9olithiques de Bretagne soul\u00e8ve des \nquestions essentielles quant aux croyances pr\u00e9historiques relatives \u00e0 la mer et au rivage \nmarin. Le concept de liminalit\u00e9 est plus particuli\u00e8rement pertinent lorsque des \npromontoires ou des \u00eeles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisies pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de restes humaines. La densit\u00e9 \nrelativement importante de chambres fun\u00e9raires qu\u2019a remarqu\u00e9e Du Ch\u00e2tellier sur les \u00eeles \nde l\u2019archipel de Mol\u00e8ne, avec ses rochers, ses anses et ses petites \u00eeles d\u00e9couvertes et \nrecouvertes par les mar\u00e9es, en constitue l'un des exemples parmi les plus impressionants. \nLa pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tude comprend une \u00e9valuation de la fiabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019inventaire publi\u00e9e par Du \nCh\u00e2tellier. Elle prend en compte \u00e9galement les modifications du trait de c\u00f4te entrain\u00e9es \npar la mont\u00e9e du niveau de la mer. Nous proposons ici  une hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle \nl'importance des changements induits par des mar\u00e9es de forte amplitude dans les eaux \npeu profondes de cet archipel a d\u00fb magnifier le caract\u00e8re liminal de cet endroit ; ce \nfaisant, elle a pu sugg\u00e9rer aux populations de ces \u00eeles des associations mythologiques ou \nsymboliques qui nous permettent d\u2019expliquer sa haute densit\u00e9 en monuments \nn\u00e9olithiques. Les r\u00e9cits ethnographiques qui nous parlent des croyances des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \ntraditionelles des littoraux nord-am\u00e9ricains et d\u2019Europe du nord offrent des indices \n 2\nsuppl\u00e9mentaires sur la signification symbolique qu\u2019ont pu porter les rivages atlantiques \npour les communaut\u00e9s n\u00e9olithiques de la Bretagne. \n \nKey words: Brittany, Neolithic, chambered tombs, coastal change, Mol\u00e8ne archipelago, \nliminality, cosmology, funerary beliefs \n \nCoasts and shorelines possess natural characteristics which must have given them special \nsignificance for early shore-dwellers. First and foremost they are liminal zones, the \nboundary between the elements, and as such suggestive locations for contact and \ncommunication between the different realms of the human cosmos. This transitional \ncharacter is heightened by the behaviour of certain species of animals that have the \nability to move between the different elements, such as seals and sea lions. Many \ntraditional beliefs of the coastal peoples place special significance on these and similar \nspecies. A second characteristic of the coastal zone is as aural experience: from the gentle \nlapping of waters to the crashing of breakers, or the low rumble that characterises the \nsteady advance and retreat of waves up a sand or shingle breach (Helskog 1999). Third \nand finally, the shoreline is uniquely mutable owing to the phenomenon of the tides. Dry \nland becomes sea, and vice versa, in a twice-daily cycle that underlines the transitional \nnature of this interface between water and land. The impact is dramatically enhanced \nwhere the tidal range is large and where gently shelving shorelines create vast intertidal \nzones. Such zones may have been endowed with special significance. To interpret this \nsignificance in a prehistoric context, however, we are reliant on material symbols which \nhave been sufficiently durable to withstand the destructive effects of these high-energy \nenvironments.   \n \nDistribution maps of Neolithic chambered tombs in Brittany have long shown the \nstrongly coastal emphasis in their placement (Fig. 1). This is especially true in respect of \nearlier types such as passage graves (c 4500-3500 BC); whereas the later all\u00e9es \ncouvertes, with their more widespread distribution, may represent the first steps in an \nagricultural colonisation of the interior during the Late Neolithic (c.3500-2500 BC) (Giot \n1960; 1981; Daniel 1960; L\u2019Helgouach 1965; Giot et al 1998; Scarre in press). \n 3\n \nA striking element of the passage grave distribution is the location of many significant \ncairns not only within the coastal zone but on headlands or islands along the shoreline \nitself, or overlooking the sea edge. In his survey of Orkney tombs, Fraser noted a similar \npattern and suggested a utilitarian association: \u201cIn any island-group, the shore is a focus \nof activity for almost every human pursuit. Almost certainly, the same result would have \nbeen obtained for the distribution of any human artefact in Orkney, from fields to \ntelephone boxes. Inland locations are avoided because they tend to be high, barren, and \ninaccessible in comparison to the coastal fringe. Thus the coastal location of chambered \ncairns is simply a reflection of the coastal location of human activity, and suggests that \nthe cairns were involved in everyday life.\u201d (Fraser 1983, 306-308).  \n \nYet tombs are not utilitarian structures, and burial places not merely for the convenient \ndisposal of the dead. Closer examination of the Breton passage graves suggests that \nconcerns very distinct from the purely utilitarian lay behind the placement of the tombs in \nsignificant locations on or adjacent to the shoreline. Fraser himself noted that many of the \nOrkney cairns were located close to rocky or cliff-girt coastlines, concluding \u201cIt is thus \nconceivable that the cairn builders preferentially located their monuments so as to ensure \nthat access by sea would be difficult.\u201d (Fraser 1983, 309). There should be no surprise in \ndiscovering that burial places were located not within but away from zones of everyday \nactivity. Alongside this must be considered the symbolic power of the coastline itself, \nmarking the boundary between land and sea just as tombs mark the boundary between the \nliving and the dead.  \n \nThe placement of the dead at the margins of the world of the living is not an unusual \nphenomenon (Parker Pearson 1999, 124ff). Headlands and islands may in this context be \nregarded as places especially appropriate for the disposal of human (or ancestral \nremains), since these are locations on the edge of the land, backed by open sea. Studies of \nthe Scottish island of Arran have suggested that its very marginality may account for its \nrelatively high number of Neolithic chambered tombs: \u201cTheir monuments are thus placed \nat the boundaries of familiar territory, in remoter regions and those which, visited more \n 4\nrarely in the past, retained an aura of the untamed wilderness\u201d (Hughes 1988, 52). The \nrole of the island as a source of Arran pitchstone, and hence a nodal point in maritime \nexchange, may also have enhanced its symbolic or mythological importance, as may its \nprominent mountains \u201cwhose permanence precluded change, and whose height soared \nabove ordinary life into the realms of myth and legend of the heroes of the past.\u201d (Hughes \n1988, 52). \n \nIdeas of marginality may have especially powerful on coastlines such as that of western \nBrittany where the edge of the land gave way to the vast and apparently limitless \nexpanses of the Atlantic Ocean. It is may have been this  \u2013  along with the westerly \ndirection of the setting sun  \u2013  which gave rise to the notion that the dwelling-place of the \ndead lay beyond the ocean ( e.g. the \u2018Isles of the Blest\u2019 of Greek Mythology: Hesiod \nWorks & Days 170ff; or the Celtic land of Annwfn, variously \u2018over the sea\u2019 or \u2018under the \nwaves\u2019: Hastings 1909, II, 689).  \n \nThe western isles \n \nCoastal liminality is nowhere more pronounced than in the low-lying islands of the \nMol\u00e8ne archipelago, off the north-west coast of Brittany (Fig. 2). The high concentration \nof monuments on these islands is known to us largely through the inventory compiled by \nPaul Du Ch\u00e2tellier during a short visit to the islands in 1901 (Fig. 3; Table 1). Many of \nthe monuments which he recorded have since been destroyed, even though farming \npressures on the relatively inaccessible islands have been much less than on the \nmainland. Several of these islands, indeed, have experienced interrupted continuity of \nsettlement, but intermittent occupation has not always spared the prehistoric monuments. \nAn 1835 report on B\u00e9niguet, for example, records that \u201cCette \u00eele est rest\u00e9e inhabit\u00e9e \ndepuis de longues \u00e9poques; elle resta ainsi pendant les guerres que nous avons eu avec \nles Anglais. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en 1815 que le fermier Corolleur y vint avec sa famille et y \nconstruisit les \u00e9difices qui existent maintenant.\u201d (Du Ch\u00e2tellier 1902, 205). The same text \nalso records how between 1815 and 1835, two all\u00e9es couvertes were destroyed, \npresumably by this very same farming family. Thus even on thinly-settled islands, \n 5\narchaeological sites  \u2013  even substantial structures such as all\u00e9es couvertes which in these \ncases reportedly measured 30 feet in length  \u2013  have been vulnerable to demolition for \nfarming in recent centuries. \n \nThe sea itself constitutes a second agent of destruction. Giot has written on several \noccasions about the loss of archaeological sites through coastal erosion, and has \nexcavated sites which were threatened in this way: notably Roc\u2019h-Avel (Giot et al. 1979) \nand Ezer (Giot & Morzadec 1992). These were passage graves, but later monuments of \nall\u00e9e couverte type have been destroyed or threatened in a similar way, such as the all\u00e9e \ncouverte on the shore at the south-eastern end of Ile Guennoc (Giot 1987, 137). The \nvulnerability is demonstrated by the all\u00e9es couvertes spectacularly situated on wide \nshelving beaches at Kernic and Lerret, which are submerged at every high tide. \n \nIn terms of monument distributions, the greatest potential for distortion lies in the \nextensive loss of land resulting from sea-level rise since the Neolithic. Thus the cluster of \nmonuments recorded on the islands by Du Ch\u00e2tellier, which appears so striking given \ntheir small size, has to be qualified by estimates of what may have existed in the large \nareas of former dry-land which have been flooded. It must be presumed that such areas \ncontained monuments which have now been destroyed. On the other hand, the known \ndistribution of passage graves, and in particular what Giot cites \u201cLa loi des sommets \nrelatifs\u201d (that most were placed in elevated locations within their local setting) may mean \nthat the drowned fringes of the islands had fewer monuments than their surviving central \ncores (Giot 1987, 191). \n \nA parallel may be drawn with chambered tombs on the Isles of Scilly, a comparable \narchipelago of islands off the south-western point of Land\u2019s End. Ashbee notes how \ntombs are generally located on ridges or headlands, with low-lying locations the \nexception: only two of some fifty monuments at the foot of a slope, and one more on a \nvery low-lying island. He concludes \u201cthat in the distribution of sites that can be seen in \npresent-day Scilly, low-lying ones seem to be the exception rather than the rule\u201d (Ashbee \n1974, 78). Recent survey has increased the number of tombs to 87, but the distribution \n 6\nremains the same (Russell 1980). The location of the Scilly tombs in relation to low-lying \nland lost to the sea confirms and illustrates this point (Ashbee 1982, fig. 1; Thomas 1985, \nfig. 43). A similar pattern of location and loss may be proposed for the chambered tombs \nof the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago. \n \n \nReliability and interpretation \n \nDu Ch\u00e2tellier\u2019s inventory of sites on the islands of the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago is an \ninvaluable document, and records a surprisingly rich archaeological heritage on these tiny \nareas of land. Questions of terminology and reliability must nonetheless be addressed in \nseeking to interpret the cultural significance of this record. \n \nAmong the sites listed by Du Ch\u00e2tellier are a number of \u2018cromlechs\u2019 (Fig. 3; Table 1). \nOne of these he locates on the small island now known as L\u00e9d\u00e9nez Vraz, which he calls \n\u2018Ile L\u00e9d\u00e9n\u00e8s de Mol\u00e8ne\u2019. At the southern end of the island \u201cest un tertre de 15 m\u00e8tres de \ndiam\u00e8tre sur 1 m\u00e8tre de haut; au sommet est un petit cromlec\u2019h de 6 m\u00e8tres de diam\u00e8tre, \nau centre duquel est une chambre dolm\u00e9nique ruin\u00e9e, monument bien int\u00e9ressant\u201d (Du \nCh\u00e2tellier 1902, 210). The term \u2018cromlech\u2019 refers usually to a stone circle. We are told of \none, consisting of eight small menhirs, on the island of Tri\u00e9len (Du Ch\u00e2tellier 1902, 205), \nand another two near the south-western coast of the Ile Mol\u00e8ne (Du Ch\u00e2tellier 1902, 209; \nFig. 4). Du Ch\u00e2tellier\u2019s description of the cromlech on L\u00e9d\u00e9nez Vraz, however, suggests \nthe megalithic kerb around a passage grave rather than a free standing circle. It should be \nnoted, furthermore, that recent work on Er Lannic and other Breton stone \u2018circles\u2019 has \nshown that these are invariably arcs or horseshoes rather than complete stone circles of \nthe kind common in western and northern Britain (Gouezin & Le Gall 1993; Bailloud et \nal. 1995). Recent excavations at Pen-ar-Lan, on the eastern headland of Ouessant, \nrevealed an ovoid arrangement of 18 small menhirs, with a narrow break on the western \nside. This setting had lost the two central menhirs recorded by Du Ch\u00e2tellier, though \nassociated were found menhirs nearby (Briard & Le Goffic in Robic 1992, 49-52). \n \n 7\nThe most striking feature of Du Ch\u00e2tellier\u2019s island inventory is the large number of burial \nchambers (mostly \u201c\u00e0 ciel ouvert\u201d). At one point he states explicitly \u201cIl est bien entendu \nque toutes les fois qu\u2019au cours de ce travail je dis chambre \u00e0 ciel ouvert, cela s\u2019entend \nd\u2019une chambre m\u00e9galithique \u00e0 ciel ouvert.\u201d (Du Ch\u00e2tellier 1902, footnote p.210). In other \nplaces he refers to \u2018chambres dolm\u00e9niques\u2019 but does not clarify whether this is an \nequivalent term. Only once does he refer to a capstone still in place (chambered tomb at \nsouth-western end of Ile Tri\u00e9len: Du Ch\u00e2tellier 1902, 206). In a small number of cases he \nrefers to a tumulus surrounding the chamber or chambers: a mound with two chambers on \nTri\u00e9len, one with four chambers on Qu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e8s, two on L\u00e9d\u00e9nez Vraz including an \n\u201cenceinte rectangulaire de 60 m\u00e8tres de plus grand diam\u00e8tre, dans laquelle sont trois \ngroupes de chambres \u00e0 ciel ouvert\u201d (Du Ch\u00e2tellier 1902, 210). These may be indications \nof cairns containing multiple passage graves, such as those excavated by Giot on Ile \nGuennoc, though the imprecision of Du Ch\u00e2tellier\u2019s description leave other \ninterpretations possible.  \n \nDoubts may legitimately be raised over some of the menhirs and alignments identified by \nDu Ch\u00e2tellier. In several cases, the small size of the stones gives rise to uncertainty. We \nmay question whether some of these might be natural features, given the ubiquity of \nnaturally detached blocks in this granitic landscape. Giot remarked the presence of \nseveral such \u2018natural menhirs\u2019 on Ile Guennoc, including \u201cune petite pierre verticale, \nd\u2019environ 0,80 m de haut, sorte de menhir miniature qui est peut-\u00eatre en fait surtout un \nmonadnock d\u00e9passant la surface d\u2019\u00e9rosion. Plus pr\u00e8s au Sud-Ouest-Sud encore, d\u2019autres \nblocs naturels d\u00e9passent tout juste comme d\u2019ailleurs encore au-dessus de la falaise \noccidentale\u201d (Giot 1987, 136). We must also recall, however, that a menhir is often \nsimply a natural stone set upright, and that recent study has clarified the manner in which \nthe Kerlescan alignments at Carnac are formed in part of just such \u2018natural stones\u2019 \n(Sellier 1995). For prehistoric communities, the natural origin or human manipulation of \nsuch stones may very well have been irrelevant to their significance. \n \nThe reliability of the Du Ch\u00e2tellier inventory has been explicitly addressed by the authors \nof the recent survey of the Ile d\u2019Ouessant, one of the islands he visited (Robic 1992). \n 8\nRobic concludes that though caution is necessary in relation to certain types of site \nrecorded by Du Ch\u00e2tellier and others, some types of monument, notably megalithic \nmonuments, were well understood at the period, and their identification can be accepted \nwith reasonable confidence: \u201cAussi, m\u00eame en restant sceptique vis-\u00e0-vis des descriptions \nou de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des enceintes et de certains tumuli, nous accordons une relative \nconfiance aux passages consacr\u00e9s aux monuments m\u00e9galithiques, vestiges bien connus \ndans la r\u00e9gion et rep\u00e9r\u00e9s depuis fort longtemps\u201d (Robic 1992, 21). Furthermore, against \nthe possibility that Du Ch\u00e2tellier may in some cases have included doubtful monuments \nin his list, we must reckon the likelihood that in his rapid visitation to these islands there \nwere other monuments that he did not see. One such may be the \u2018English\u2019 cromlech on \nB\u00e9niguet, a ring of standing stones sketched by the Chevalier de Fr\u00e9minville in the early \n19th century (Le Pontois 1929, 124; Burl 1993, 55). It may already have been destroyed \nby the time of Du Ch\u00e2tellier\u2019s visit.  \n \nIn sum, the pattern of sites recorded by Du Ch\u00e2tellier may be accepted, within certain \ndegrees of caution, as a representative record. How then may one explain his finding that \nthe density of Neolithic monuments was very much greater on the small, low-lying \nislands than on cliff-girt Ouessant (Fig. 3)? The argument again may be put forward that \nit was the particular character of coastlines that was a key factor in the placement of \nmonuments. Even during the Neolithic period, when sea-levels were lower, the gently \nshelving edges of the small islands of the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago must have been alternately \nflooded and exposed by the changing tides. Ouessant, on the other hand, with its tall \ncliffs, would not have been affected in this way. It may also be that the smaller islands \nwere considered too marginal for permanent occupation, in contrast to the much larger \nOuessant. Recent survey on Ouessant has located a number of possible settlement sites \nwhich can be assigned to the Late Neolithic period (Robic 1992, 26-29). There is also \nevidence that human impact on the environment of Ouessant may have begun in the \nNeolithic (Gebhardt & Marguerie in Robic 1992, 15), though we may perhaps stop short \nof the conclusion of \u201cl\u2019intense occupation d\u2019Ouessant \u00e0 cette p\u00e9riode\u201d (Robic 1992, 27) \n \nSea-level change and the western isles \n 9\n \nThe mutability of the coastal zone includes not only the daily tidal cycle but extends to \nthe dramatic changes in land- and seascape induced by postglacial sea-level rise. At the \nheight of the last Glacial the islands were joined to the mainland, but by the early \nNeolithic they were separated from the mainland and progressively also from each other, \nthough B\u00e9niguet, Qu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e8s, Tri\u00e9len and Mol\u00e8ne were at first joined into a single land \nmass separated by deep channels from both the mainland to the east and Ouessant to the \nwest. \n \nOuessant, the most outlying of the islands, and separated from the others by the 60m deep \nFromveur channel, has no evidence of human occupation earlier than the Final \nPalaeolithic (c.10,000 BC), when low sea levels would have reduced the passage between \nit and the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago to a narrow crossing (Robic 1992, 27). The islands of the \nMol\u00e8ne archipelago, by contrast, have Lower Palaeolithic occupation (notably the \nchopper from Ile Mol\u00e8ne assigned to the later part of the Holsteinian interglacial [isotope \nstage 11: 428-352,000 BP]: Molines 1992; see also Monnier in Giot et al. 1998, 77). \nThese may correspond to periods of low sea-level when the islands were joined to the \nmainland.  \n \nAccording to Morzadec-Kerfourn (in Giot et al. 1998, 437-440), sea-level stood at -40m \nat 7800 BC, rising by 5000 BC to a level where the highest tides were equivalent in \nheight to the lowest tides of the present day. The Admiralty Charts indicate that such a \nrise in sea level would have opened up a narrow channel between the mainland and the \nMol\u00e8ne archipelago (at a channel depth of up to 10.2 metres). It may also have divided \nsome of the islands from each other, though the moderating effect of coastal bars and \ndunes would have had considerable bearing on the precise outcome. A key location in \nthis topographic reconstruction is the \u2018Tournant de Lochrist\u2019 where the channel between \nthe mainland and the nearest of the islands becomes narrow and sinuous. This would \nhave been the narrowest point of the sea-channel separating the mainland from the \nislands, since the strength of present-day currents on this section of coast suggests that it \nis unlikely to have been closed by a sand bar. \n 10\n \nComparison may be drawn with the process of island formation in the Isles of Scilly off \nLand\u2019s End. For Scilly, Ratcliffe and Straker have used calibrated radiocarbon date \nranges for selected intertidal peat samples to estimate a highest sea level of -2.5m OD at \n5000 Cal BC, rising to a little below -1m OD at 3000 Cal BC (Ratcliffe & Straker 1996, \n44-50). This supersedes the much steeper curve proposed by Thomas (1985, 22ff). \nMorzadec-Kerfourn proposes a level for the highest seas of approximately -2 metres at \n3000 BC, which conforms reasonably closely to the figure proposed for Scilly \n(Morzadec-Kerfourn in Giot et al. 1998, diagram p. 438). \n \nIn Scilly, as in the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago, large areas of shoreline are uncovered or only \nthinly covered by the sea at low tide; it is on occasion possible to wade through the \nshallow waters between the Isles of Scilly, and reports exist of submerged settlements  \u2013  \nsome perhaps of Roman date  \u2013  on the sea bed (Thomas 1985, pp.52ff). Thomas also \nhighlights the role of storm surges in breaching sand bars and reshaping the topography. \nHe postulates that one such westerly surge may have broken through a coastal dune \nbetween Tresco and St Mary\u2019s and inundated the central lowlands of the original main \nisland (Thomas 1985, fig 41). The chronology which he proposes must be revised in the \nlight of the more recent evidence, but his model does help to illustrate the interaction \nbetween sea-level, storm surges and coastal topography; and to underline, above all, the \nmarginal nature of these large tracts of low-lying land, threatened but not necessarily \nflooded as sea-level rose to within 5 metres of its present level. \n \nReconstructing the shoreline of the western isles of Brittany during the Neolithic \nindicates that extent of the intertidal zone some 7000 years ago was several times larger \nthan it is today (Fig. 5). The transformative action of the twice-daily tides would have \nbeen correspondingly more dramatic. Whereas every coastline with a sea vista beyond \nmarks the boundary between the worlds of land, sky and water, it is rare to encounter \nsuch an extensive intertidal zone, with its hints of hidden realms in the jagged rock \nformations, alternatively submerged and exposed by the tides, that are characteristic of \nthis coast. The dramatic tidal range will have reinforced the liminal character of the \n 11\nMol\u00e8ne archipelago, and may well be the key to understanding the proliferation of \nNeolithic monuments on these islands. The much lesser density of such monuments on \nOuessant may be explained within the same model, given that the steep cliffs of Ouessant \npreclude an extensive intertidal zone; the sea moves vertically rather than horizontally \nwith the tidal cycle, and little new land is exposed at low tide. The liminal quality of \nOuessant is hence very different, and arguably much less impressive, than that of the \nneighbouring islands to the east. \n \nThe regional context \n \nThe island monuments of the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago fit into a broader pattern of coastal \nlocation among Neolithic monuments in Brittany. Along the northern coast, the published \nliterature (notably L\u2019Helgouach 1965 & Giot 1987) includes references to some 25 burial \nmounds containing 50 separate passage graves. Some of these, such as Men-ar-Romped, \nVille-Pichard, Saint-Gonvel, Carn and Barnenez, are on coastal headlands; others, \nincluding S\u00e9gal, Melon, Guennoc and Carn are on small offshore islands which were also \noriginally coastal headlands. At Br\u00e9touar\u00e9, the passage grave stands on a prominent hill \noverlooking the coastal marsh of Ker Emma, and though the sea is clearly visible beyond \nthis the site is over a kilometre inland. The presence of the place name Enez Vihan \n(\u2018enez\u2019 the Breton for island), however, suggests that the Ker Emma lowland was a \nshallow marine bay up to historical times. The process of aggradation here may be \ncompared with recently documented for the Marais de Dol (Lautridou et al. 1995). \n \nIt would nonetheless be incorrect to suggest that all early passage graves of northern \nBrittany were located in such close proximity to the sea. Tossen-ar-Run at Yvias is 5.5 \nkms inland, and out of sight of the sea. La Ville Hamon at Erquy is also relatively far \nback from the sea edge, and views towards the sea are obscured by rising ground in most \ndirections. Furthermore, coastal change means that whereas Br\u00e9touar\u00e9 may have been \nnearer the coast in the Neolithic than it is today, in most cases the reverse will have been \nthe case. This is particularly true of sites today in estuarine situations such as Lingoz \n(Henvic), Men-ar-Romped (Kerbors) and Crec\u2019h Bleiss (Penvenan). It remains the case, \n 12\nhowever, that the great majority of these tombs have a closer connection with the sea \nthan being located simply within the coastal band. \n \nThe high density of Neolithic monuments is also a characteristic which the Mol\u00e8ne \narchipelago shares with other islands. The small island of Guennoc off the north coast of \nBrittany has fifteen passage graves grouped within four cairns, yet measures only 400 \nmetres from north to south (Giot 1987). Looking northwards, the Isles of Scilly have a \ntotal of 87 Neolithic chambered tombs (Russell 1980), and over 80 are recorded on the \nOrkney islands (Davidson & Henshall 1989). Attempts to explain these concentrations in \nterms of better circumstances of preservation on offshore islands carry some weight but \nmay be judged inadequate to explain the pattern as a whole. Islands appear to have held a \nspecial significance which made them especially appropriate for the placement of the \ndead, perhaps by virtue of their marginality as in the study of Arran cited earlier (Hughes \n1988). In a Bronze Age context, Bradley has noted how ship carvings in the Bohusl\u00e4n \nprovince of Sweden occur around hills capped by cairns; the suggestion that the ship \ncarvings represent water would make the effect to be to transform these hills into \nconceptual islands. The cairns on inland \u2018island\u2019 hilltops would hence parallel the coastal \ncairns built on true islands (Bradley 2000, 141). These parallel cases indicate that the \nimportance of islands as burial places extends far beyond the Mol\u00e8ne archipelago, and \nhelps to counter any residual doubts over the reliability of the Du Ch\u00e2tellier inventory. \n \n \nCoastal beliefs \n \nIn order to understand better the kinds of beliefs and understandings which early societies \nmay have held of these coastal environments, it may be helpful to consider ethnographic \nexamples from a similar setting. Among the most fully recorded of the beliefs and \ncosmologies of coastal peoples are those of the various peoples inhabiting the North-\nWest Coast of North America. These are well-known for their development of complex \nsocieties without the adoption of agriculture, leading to their classification as \u2018affluent \nhunter-gatherers\u2019 (Ames & Maschner 1999). They inhabit villages, even though they may \n 13\nshift the location of these settlements two or three times a year in a form of modified \nsedentism. These societies are also famous ethnographically for engaging in potlatch \nceremonies, displays of conspicuous consumption which confirmed social ranking but \nalso had a religious role in relation to mortuary rituals or the propitiation of supernatural \nforces, to restore the proper order of things when, for example, a ritual had been \nincorrectly performed (Walens 1981). The North-West Coast societies, and especially the \nHaida of the Queen Charlotte Islands, were also famous for their carving of totem poles, \nsome of which commemorated the dead. They could be erected in front of the house \nwhere the deceased chief had lived or, less commonly, as a form of grave marker. The \npossible parallel with the standing stones often associated with chambered tombs in \nNorth-West Europe is striking, but may be misleading, though the idea that standing \nstones in some way represent or commemorate the dead is persuasive. \n \nThe relevance of the Northwest Coast societies to the coastal Neolithic of northern \nBrittany lies at a more general illustrative level. The Pacific coastline of Canada, like that \nof Brittany, is deeply indented with estuaries, bays and offshore islands. Settlements are \non coasts or rivers, and much use is made of water transport. Marine and riverine \nresources (notably seasonal salmon runs) play a key role in subsistence. Many of these \ncommunities moved around their landscape during the course of the year, exploiting \nresources as they became available. For coastally-based groups such as the Nootka, \nhowever, the interior was a place of danger and mystery: \u201cTo most of them, mountains \nwere objects to be lined up in ranges to locate offshore points, rather than localities to be \ntraversed and known intimately. It is consistent that the woods and mountains were \nthought to be populated by vast numbers of dangerous and horrendous supernatural \nbeings, while the sea possessed fewer and less malignant spirits\u201d (Drucker 1951, 151). \nSomething similar is implied in the Tsimshian myth of Asdiwal, subject of a classic \nstructuralist analysis by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss. Here Asdiwal is an accomplished hunter of \nthe hills and forests (in one dialect his name is Asi-hwil, \u2018Crosser of Mountains\u2019), aided \nby magic objects including bow and arrows which never miss, snowshoes and bark cape. \nWhen he travels down to the coast and engages in a sea-hunt, however, he is abandoned \npowerless on a reef in high seas and is taken to the subterranean home of the sea lions \n 14\nwhere he comes as healer rather than hunter, and has to ask those who would be his prey \nto help him back to land (L\u00e9vi-Strauss 1967). This myth clearly emphasises the \nopposition between land and sea, land-hunt and sea-hunt, suggesting that the two are \nseparate realms. Among the Nootka there was a belief that wolves and killer whales were \nthe same beings, killer whales turning into wolves as they emerged from the sea (Drucker \n1951, 152). \n \nThe transformative power of the land-sea boundary is shown also in beliefs about death.  \nAmong peoples such as the Kwakiutl, burial underground was traditionally avoided, \nsince it prevented the soul of the dead person (when released by decomposition) from \nfinding a human body in which to be reborn. It represented the removal of the body from \nthis world to another, underground world, where rebirth in a human body was not \npossible (Walens 1981, 60). For that reason, the Kwakiutl placed bodies of the dead in \ntrees, and other North-West Coast peoples used rock-clefts and caves for the same \npurpose. The Northern Coast Salish placed the dead body in a wooden mortuary box and \nset in a cave or rock crevasse on a nearby island, or a site away from the village \n(Kennedy & Bouchard 1990). Several peoples believed, however, that death involved a \njourney across water: \u201cWhen a man was dead, he found himself on a trail, and, following \nit, came out upon the shores of a sort of bay. On the other side of this bay was the Land \nof Souls. Then, standing upon the bank, he called across, and was presently answered by \nthe appearance of a person, carrying a red walking-stick, who pushed a kind of raft from \nthe farther side. This raft looked as if it were composed of fine cedar-bark . . . It came of \nitself to the place where the man was standing, and ferried him over (Swanton 1905, 34).  \n \nMore general was a belief in the numinous nature of landscape features. Swanton gives a \nlong list of the so-called \u2018Ocean People\u2019, the supernatural beings whom the Haida \nbelieved to live along the coasts of the Queen Charlotte Islands (Swanton 1905, 19-22). \nBoas remarks of the Tsimshian that \u201cAll nature, the heavenly bodies, rocks and islands, \nwaterfalls, animals, and plants are beings of supernatural power whom a man can \napproach with prayer, whose help he can ask, and to whom he may express his thanks\u201d \n(Boas 1966, 155). The Haida conceived of their world as \u201can expanse of sea upon which \n 15\ntwo islands are floating, \u2014 Inland-Country or Haida-Land, and Seaward-Country or \nMainland. . . Although said to float, the Haida-Country, at least, has a firmer foundation \nin the shape of a great supernatural being called Sacred-One-standing-and-moving . . . \nHe, in turn, rests upon a copper box, but what supports that they do not say. Neither do \nthey attempt to explain how Mainland is supported, apparently because that knowledge is \nthe business of mainland people\u201d (Swanton 1905, 12). \n \nThese specific beliefs are not directly applicable to the Neolithic of northern Brittany. \nThey do emphasise a number of elements which might however be of relevance in \nunderstanding the distribution of the tombs, notably the transformative nature of the \nsea\/land boundary and the character of the landscape as a world populated by spirits. \nThere was also a concept of an undersea world, where the sea-creatures lived, just like \nhuman societies and sometimes in human form (Drucker 1951, 151). This ethnography \nprovides a general illustration of the way in which traditional coastal societies may \ninterpret or understand the shoreline on which they live, with forested hinterland behind \nand rocks, islands and open sea in front. The mistrust of the interior expressed in Nootka \nbeliefs may well have been shared by early Neolithic societies of northern Brittany, who \nappear on the whole to have avoided areas away from the coast, though they may \noccasionally have travelled some distance inland in order to obtain special resources such \nas Plussulien dolerite. \n \nThe ethnography of northernmost Europe and Siberia provides additional emphasis on \nthe importance of the shoreline (Bradley 2000; Helskog 1999).Helskog has invoked this \nethnography to interpret the location of prehistoric rock carvings in Karelia and northern \nRussia in the intertidal zone. He cites cosmological beliefs traditional to the peoples of \nthis region, for whom the shoreline is the boundary between the three worlds of water, \nland and sky. The middle world, that of the land, is inhabited by humans and animals, \nwhereas upper (sky) and lower (between water and land) worlds are the domain of spirits \nand the dead. \u201cA main aim of rituals is to communicate with spirits and souls in the \ndifferent worlds. . . [T]he boundaries of the three natural zones and the three \ncosmological worlds meet at the shore. In this sense the shore is a contact zone between \n 16\nthe worlds of the universe and could thereby contain an especially strong place for ritual \ncommunication.\u201d (Helskog 1999, 77).  \n \nHelskog uses insights drawn from northern ethnography to inform his study of the rock \ncarvings of the intertidal zone, both in terms of their placement and their subject matter. \nTo undertake this analysis, he postulates a certain degree of continuity between the \nbeliefs of the communities who made the rock carvings and the ethnographically \ndocumented peoples of the region, such as the Saami, the Chukchi and the Samoyed. For \nthe Breton prehistoric case, the significance lies in the correspondence between certain of \nthese beliefs concerning the shoreline and the opposition between land, sea and sky, with \nthose of the native peoples of north-western North America. This opens the possibility \nthat such beliefs were considerably more widespread in the northern hemisphere before \nthe development of full-scale farming economies in the later prehistoric period.  \n \nThe liminality of the shoreline is a theme taken up also by Pollard in the context of west \nScottish shell middens: \u201cThe association of the beach itself with the transformation \nbetween life and death would have been more than metaphorical; it is here that dead \nanimals, and perhaps more rarely even humans, would periodically be washed ashore \nafter dying at sea\u201d (Pollard 1996, 204). Pollard comments also on the association of \nchambered tombs in western Scotland with raised beaches, remarking \u201cIt should not be \nforgotten that raised beaches represent land which had once been sea, and this in itself \n[may] have imbued these areas with a special meaning\u201d and of the isostatic uplift \nresponsible for the raised beaches \u201cit is not unreasonable to suggest that people were \naware of this dramatic change, possibly through stories being passed down from one \ngeneration to the next, perhaps in the form of creation myths, with the giving up of new \nlands by the sea or the turning of the tide on a grand scale marking an important change \nin the way that people lived their lives\u201d (Pollard 1996, 206).  \n \nWhether the Neolithic communities of northern Brittany had any awareness of long-term \nsea-level rise is perhaps hard to say, but that they were familiar with the twice-daily ebb \nand flow of the tides must be beyond question. It is equally likely that the nature of the \n 17\nislands and ideas about land, sea and shoreline played a crucial role in forming the beliefs \nand attitudes of these prehistoric communities. Having accepted as much, it is only \nlogical to suppose that the placement and design of the tombs were related closely with \nthose beliefs. In the last analysis, however, whether such an interpretation is tenable \ndepends on the evidence of the monuments themselves. Their systematic location in the \nliminal zone where the land meets the sea suggests a real concern with this symbolic \ndivide, a metaphor perhaps for life and death. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI am grateful to Professor Richard Bradley for comments on an earlier version of this \narticle. \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAmes, K.M., & Maschner, H.D.G., 1999.
