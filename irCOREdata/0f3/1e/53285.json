Introduction \nComparisons of the differences in the beam interaction characteristics with various materials of \nthe predominant materials processing lasers, the CO2, the Nd:YAG and the excimer laser, are \nlimited. Previously the main fundamental differences resulting from wavelength variations of \nCO, CO2, Nd:YAG and excimer lasers for a number of materials processing applications have \nbeen detailed [1-4]. Likewise, such practical comparisons between these traditional materials \nprocessing lasers and the more contemporary high power diode laser (HPDL) are even fewer in \nnumber. Previously Schmidt et al. [5] compared the performance of CO2, excimer and HPDL in \nthe removal of chlorinated rubber coatings from concrete surfaces, noting wavelength \ndependant differences in the process performance. Additionally, Bradley et al. [6] compared the \nCO2 and HPDL for the treatment of Al2O3-based refractory materials in terms of microstructure, \nobserving wavelength dependant microstructural characteristics unique to each laser. In more \ncomprehensive investigations, Lawrence et al. [7, 8] compared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, \nexcimer and HPDL radiation on the wettability characteristics of an Al2O3\/SiO2 based ceramic, \nnoting that changes in the wettability characteristics of the material varied depending upon the \nlaser type. \nThe interfacial phenomena of wetting is often the primary factor governing whether a coating \nwill adhere and bond to a substrate in practical applications such as enamelling and thermal \nspray coating. To date, very little work exists pertaining to the use of lasers for altering the \nsurface properties of materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. \nNotwithstanding this, it is recognised within the currently published work that laser irradiation \nof material surfaces can effect their wettability characteristics. Previously Zhou et al. [9,10] \nhave carried out work on laser coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, \netc.), reporting on the well documented fact that generated oxide layers often promote \nmetal\/oxide wetting. Furthermore, Heitz et al. [11], Henari et al. [12] and Olfert et al. [13] have \nfound that excimer laser treatment of metals results in improved coating adhesion. The \nimprovements in adhesion were attributed to the fact that the excimer laser treatment resulted in \na smoother surface and as such enhanced the action of wetting. However, the reasons for these \nchanges with regard to changes in the material\u2019s surface morphology, surface composition and \nsurface energy are not reported. In contrast, work on HPDL modification of the wettability \ncharacteristics of a number of different ceramic materials [14] has shown that the wettability \nperformance is affected by changes in the surface roughness, the surface O2 content and the \nsurface energy.  \n This present work describes the beam interaction characteristics of 1 kW CO2 laser, a 400 W \nNd:YAG laser, a 5 W KrF excimer laser and a 1.2 kW HPDL with a common mild steel \nspecifically in terms of the differing effects thereof on the wettability characteristics. These \nincorporate chiefly: contact angle variations, the differences in morphological and \nmicrostructural features, the surface composition, and the surface energy changes. \n2. Experimental procedure \n2.1. Materials processing procedures \nThe solid materials used as substrates in the wetting experiments were rectangular billets (50 x \n100mm with a thickness of 3mm) of common engineering low carbon mild steel (EN8). The \ncontact surfaces of the materials were used as-received in the experiments. The general laser \nprocessing experimental arrangement comprised of the defocused laser beams being fired back \nand forth across the surfaces of the mild steel by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam \nusing the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table. The general operating characteristics of the \nlasers used in the study are detailed in Table1. Both pulsed and CW lasers were used in the \nstudy, therefore, both the average power and the peak power of each laser will differ. So, in \norder to reasonably compare the effects of each laser on the wettability characteristics of the \nmild steel, the laser energy density (fluence) of each laser beam incident on the mild steel \nsurface was set by manipulating the laser power density and traverse speed in the case of the \nCO2 laser and the HPDL, and the laser power density, pulse width and frequency in the case of \nthe Nd:YAG and excimer lasers, such that the energy density of each of the four lasers incident \nupon the mild steel surface was around 159 J\/cm2. \n2.3. Contact angle and surface energy analysis procedure \nTo investigate the effects of laser radiation on the wetting and surface energy characteristics of \nthe mild steel wetting experiments were conducted. The experiments were comprised of control \nexperiments carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of test liquids with \nknown surface energy properties. Thus it was possible to quantify any surface energy changes \nin the mild steel resulting from laser interaction. \nThe sessile drop control experiments were carried out, using human blood, human blood \nplasma, glycerol and 4-octanol. Details of the test liquids, along with their total surface energy \n( \u03b3 2 ), dispersive (\u03b3 lv\nd\n) and polar (\u03b3 lv\np\n) component values can be found elsewhere [14]. The \nexperiments were conducted in atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 200C. The droplets \nwere released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the test substrate materials (laser \n treated and untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops \nbeing approximately 6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile \nphotographs of the sessile drops being obtained every minute. The contact angles were then \nmeasured with a mean value being subsequently determined. The standard deviation due to \nexperimental error was calculated as being \u00b10.20.  \nIt was observed during the wetting experiments conducted with both the enamel and the control \nliquids that, throughout the period of the experiments, no discernible change in the magnitude \nof the contact angle was observed, indicating that thermodynamic equilibrium was established \nat the solid-liquid interface at the outset of the experiments. This is perhaps surprising when \none considers the temperature effect on surface tension as described by Mayers [15]. However, \nresults similar to those observed in this study have been described by Agathopoulos et al. [16]. \nFor comparison purposes, enamel-mild steel wetting experiments were carried out in \natmospheric conditions with molten droplets of the enamel (6000C). The temperature of the \nenamel throughout the experiments was measured using a Cyclops infrared pyrometer. The \ndroplets were released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the mild steel (laser treated \nand untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being \napproximately 15 x 10-3 cm3. Profile photographs of the sessile enamel drop were obtained for \nevery 600C fall in temperature of the molten enamel drop, with the contact angle subsequently \nbeing measured, and a mean value being obtained. Again, the standard deviation due to \nexperimental error was calculated as being \u00b10.20.  \n3. Effects of laser radiation on contact angle characteristics \nAs one can see from Table 2, under the experimental laser parameters employed, laser \nirradiation of the surfaces of the mild steel samples resulted in changes in the contact angle. \nTable 2 shows clearly that such changes were dependent upon the laser used. It can be seen that \nin general, interaction of the mild steel with CO2 and the excimer laser radiation resulted in \nmarginal increases in the contact angle between the mild steel and the control liquids. In \ncontrast, interaction of the mild steel with the Nd:YAG and HPDL beams resulted in the \ncontact angle between the mild steel and the control liquids reducing.   \n3.1. Variations in surface roughness characteristics \nAccording to Neumann [17, 18], a model similar to that for heterogeneous solid surfaces can be \ndeveloped in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by a rearrangement of \nWenzel\u2019s equation: \n  \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3 \u03b8\nsl sv\nlv w\nr\n= \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\ncos\n (1) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \n\u03b8w is the contact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. Equation (1) shows clearly that if the \nroughness factor, r, is large, that is the solid surface is smooth, then \u03b3sl will become small, thus, \na reduction in the contact angle will be inherently realised by the liquid if \u03b8<900. In contrast, if \n\u03b8>900 then the opposite will be observed. \nThe various surface effects of the respective lasers on the mild steel are clearly discernible from \nFigure 1. From the microstructures shown in Figure 1 it would appear that in all instances of \nlaser treatment, surface melting and resolidification to varying degrees was induced. Indeed, \nreductions in the surface roughness of the mild steel were observed (using a Taylor-Hobson \nSurtronic 3+ profileometer) after interaction with the Nd:YAG and the HPDL beams, reducing \nfrom an initial Ra value of 1.46\u00b5m to 1.25\u00b5m and 1.12\u00b5m respectively. However, interaction of \nthe mild steel with the CO2 and excimer laser radiation occasioned the roughening of the mild \nsteel surface, causing the surface roughness to increase to the respective Ra values of 2.58\u00b5m \nand 2.12\u00b5m. Indeed, Feng et al. [19] noted that under certain surface conditions, contact angle \nis inversely proportional the surface roughness. \n3.2. Variations in surface oxygen content \nThe O2 content of a material\u2019s surface is an influential factor governing the wetting \nperformance of the material [20, 21]. Wetting is governed by the first atomic layers of the \nsurface of a material. Thus, in order to determine element content of O2 at the surface of the \nmild steel, it was necessary to examine the surface using x-ray photoemission spectroscopy \n(XPS). \nClear differences in the surface O2 content of the mild steel after interaction with all the \nselected lasers were observed. Increases in the surface O2 content were experienced by the mild \nsteel after interaction with CO2, the Nd:YAG and the HPDL beams, increasing from an initial \nvalue of 34.2atomic% to 41.5atomic%, 35.7atomic% and 40.1atomic% respectively. \nConversely, interaction of the mild steel with excimer laser radiation resulted in the surface O2 \ncontent of the mild steel decreasing slightly to 32.8atomic%. \n4. Surface energy and the dispersive\/polar characteristics \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety \nof intermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [22]. The \n majority of these forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and \nas such the total surface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d \n(dispersive component; since van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their \nchemical nature). Therefore, the surface energy of any system can be described by [22] \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (2) \nSimilarly, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface [22]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (3) \nBy equating Equation (3) with the Young-Dupre Equation: \n ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (4) \nthe contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to the surface energies of the respective \nliquid and solid by \n   \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (5) \nIn accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [22] and Agathopoulos et al. [16], it is \npossible to estimate reasonably accurately the dispersive component of the mild steel surface \nenergy, \u03b3 sv\nd\n, by plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv in accordance with Equation (5) \n[22], with the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n being estimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which \nconnects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the intercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against \n(\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the abscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1. Figure 2 shows the best-fit \nplot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv for the untreated and laser treated mild steel-experimental \ncontrol liquids system.  \nA comparison of the ordinate intercept points of the untreated and laser treated mild steel-liquid \nsystems is given in Figure 2. One can see clearly that the best-fit straight lines for the mild-\nsteel-liquid systems of the Nd:YAG laser and especially the HPDL intercept the ordinate higher \nabove the origin than those of the untreated, CO2 laser and excimer laser treated mild steel \nsamples. This is of great importance since interception of the ordinate close to the origin is \ncharacteristic of the dominance of dispersion forces acting at the mild steel-liquid interfaces of \n the untreated and excimer laser treated samples, resulting in poor adhesion [22, 23]. On the \nother hand, an interception of the ordinate well above the origin is indicative of the action of \npolar forces across the interface, in addition to dispersion forces, hence improved wettability \nand adhesion is promoted [22, 23]. Furthermore, because none of the best-fit straight lines \nintercept below the origin, then it can be said that the development of an equilibrium film \npressure of adsorbed vapour on the mild steel surface (untreated and laser treated) did not occur \n[22, 23]. \nAgain, in accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [22] and Agathopoulos et al. [16], it is \nnot possible to determine the value of the polar component of the mild steel surface \nenergy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, directly from Figure 2. This is because the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 \nagainst (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at ( )2 1 2\u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and \nnot the control liquid system as a whole. However, it has been established that the entire \namount of the surface energies due to dispersion forces either of the solids or the liquids are \nactive in the wettability performance [22, 24]. As such, it is possible to calculate the dispersive \ncomponent of the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n,  using only the relevant part of Equation (3) thus \n ( )Wadd svd lvd= 2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\/\n (6) \nThe results reveal that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and \nlaser treated mild steel surfaces, bothWad  and Wad\nd\n are related by the straight line relationship \n  W aW bad ad\nd= +  (7) \nwhere a and b are constants unique to each control liquid system. Also, for the control test \nliquids used, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar components of the control \ntest liquids surface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n                                  ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n13 115\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (8) \nBy introducing Equation (7) into Equation (3) and rearranging, then \n  ( )W a W badp add= \u2212 +1  (9) \nBy combining Equation (9) with Equation (3) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, then \nthe following can be derived: \n                    ( ) ( )\n( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (10) \nThus, from the best-fit straight line plots of Wad  against Wad\nd\n for the mild steel when it is both \nuntreated and laser treated, it was possible to determine the constants a and b for each separate \ncondition of the mild steel. Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the untreated and laser \ntreated mild steel from Figure 2, then it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser \ntreated mild steel using Equation (10). \nAs one can see from Table 3, Nd:YAG laser, HPDL and excimer laser treatment of the surface \nof the mild steel effected small increases in the polar component of the surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n. \nSuch increases in the polar component of the surface energy of the mild steel have a positive \neffect upon the action of wetting and adhesion.  \n5. Discussion of laser effected wettability characteristics modification \nThe results detailed previously show clearly that interaction of the mild steel with the selected \nindustrial lasers has resulted in the contact angle formed between the control liquids altering to \nvarious degrees depending upon the laser type. Under the selected experimental laser operating \nparameters, interaction of the mild steel typically with the Nd:YAG and HPDL beams effected \nin decrease in the contact angle, whilst interaction of the mild steel with CO2 and excimer laser \nradiation occasioned small increases in the contact angle. Such changes in the value of the \ncontact angle are influenced, depending upon the laser used, primarily by:  \n1. Modifications to the Surface Roughness - Depending upon the laser used, in this \ninstance the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL, the particular experimental laser \nparameters employed resulted in the ideal degree of melting and resolidification of \nthe mild steel surface being induced. This in turn resulted in a reduction of the \nsurface roughness, thus directly reducing the contact angle, \u03b8. \n2. Surface Roughening - Depending upon the laser used, in this case the CO2 laser, the \nparticular experimental laser parameters employed resulted in a degree of melting \nand resolidification of the mild steel surface being induced which was not conducive \nto surface smoothing. Also, in the case of the excimer laser the resultant ablation of \nthe mild steel surface resulted directly  in an increase in the surface roughness. In \nboth instances the increase in the mild steel surface roughness resulted inherently in \nan increase in the contact angle, \u03b8. \n 3. Surface O2 Content - An increase in the surface O2 content of the mild steel resulting \nfrom laser treatment is an influential factor in the promotion of the action of wetting, \nsince an increase in surface O2 content inherently effects a decrease in the contact \nangle, and vice versa. \n4. Increase in the Polar Component,\u03b3 sv\np\n, of the Surface Energy - Resulting from the \nmelting and resolidification of the mild steel surface, thus creating a different \nmicrostructure that quite possibly improved the action of wetting and adhesion. \nFrom Figure 1 it can be seen that microstructures of the CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL treated \nsamples appear to be indicative of melting and resolidification. Indeed, the microstructures of \nthe Nd:YAG and HPDL treated samples are very similar in nature. However, the microstructure \nof the CO2 laser treated sample differs greatly. It is surmised that in the instances of the \nNd:YAG and HPDL treated samples, the optimum degree of surface melting is obtained, \nresulting in the minimum surface roughness. Similar laser induced surface smoothing effects \nwere obtained by Nicolas et al. [25] and Henari et al. [12], who observed that excimer laser \ntreatment of ceramics and metals could result in the generation of a smoother surface. In \ncontrast, it is believed that in the instance of the CO2 laser treated sample, where the surface of \nthe mild steel has become roughened as a consequence of laser interaction, the roughening is \noccasioned as a result of excess energy being absorbed by the surface of the mild steel, leading \ntherefore to a higher level of surface melting. This in turn causes micro-porosities and a \ngenerally rough surface profile.  \nIndeed, this supposition is borne out somewhat by Figure 3, which shows that the surface \ncondition of the mild steel resulting from HPDL modification (with a number of different \ntraverse speeds) greatly affected the measured contact angle between the mild steel and vitreous \nenamel (see Figure 4). As one can see from Figure 3, at relatively low traverse speeds excess \nenergy is deposited on the surface of the mild steel resulting in a high level of surface melting. \nThis in turn causes porosities and a generally rough surface profile. As the traverse speed \nincreases, however, the energy deposited on the surface of the mild steel reduces. Accordingly \nthe degree of surface melting reduces ultimately to the optimum degree, resulting in the \nminimum surface roughness, and contact angle, at around 1500 mm\/min. Beyond this point the \nsurface roughness, and contact angle, can be seen to increase, indicating that insufficient \nmelting, and consequently smoothing, was achieved. Again, such results are in accord with \nthose obtained by Feng et al. [19], who noted that under certain surface conditions, contact \nangle reduction was inversely proportional to surface roughness. Moreover, Olfert et al. [13] \nfound that excimer laser treatment of steel surfaces greatly improved the adhesion of a zinc \n coating. They asserted that laser treatment occasioned the smoothing of many of the high \nfrequency surface features, resulting in more complete wetting by the zinc. \nThe CO2 laser operates in the CW mode and consequently the laser operating parameters used \nin the experiments were exactly the same as those of the HPDL in every way (power, beam \ndiameter, traverse speed, etc.), the only difference being, however, the laser wavelength. There \nare many other factors that may quite possibly come into play, but since the microstructures \nobtained after CO2 (Figure 1(b)) and HPDL (Figure 1(d)) treatment were so different, then it is \nperhaps reasonable to propose that these changes are the result of wavelength difference \naffected beam absorption. What is more, the definite similarity between the microstructures \nobtained after Nd:YAG (Figure 1(c)) and HPDL (Figure 1(d)) treatment indicate further the \nexistence of a wavelength relationship. \nIn contrast, as Figure 1(e) shows, interaction of the mild steel with excimer laser radiation did \nnot cause melting of the surface, but instead induced surface ablation which consequently \nresulted in a slightly rougher surface. Thus an increase in the contact angle was effected. \nSimilar observations were made by Lawrence et al. [8] during surface treatment of a ceramic \ncompound using an excimer laser. Additionally, Kokai et al. [26] have concluded that, with \nexcimer laser parameters which are conducive to the production of plasma, as was the case with \nthe mild steel, then the surface roughness is increased as a result of plasma induced debris \nredepositing on the surface and excessive thermally induced surface fractures and porosities. \nClearly, since plasma generation was observed, then surface roughening after excimer laser \nirradiation was perhaps to be expected. However, Liu et al. [27], Nicolas et al. [25] and Henari \net al. [12], have reported that irradiating ZrO2 with excimer laser radiation with energy densities \nin excess of 2.7 J\/cm2, resulted in a reduction in surface roughness. Such reductions were \nattributed to the fact that at these levels of energy density, melting of the ZrO2 surface occurred.  \nBy means of cross-sectional SEM analysis it was possible to determine the laser melt\/ablation \ndepth for each laser. It was found that the depth of the laser melting, and in the case of the \nexcimer laser, the ablation region, varied significantly according to laser type. For the CO2, \nNd:YAG and HPDL the melt depths were measured as 170\u00b5m, 45\u00b5m and 100\u00b5m respectively, \nwhilst for the excimer laser the ablation depth was measured as 10\u00b5m. Clearly, the differences \nin laser melt\/ablation depth obtained with the Nd:YAG and excimer lasers was an order of \nmagnitude smaller than those of the CO2 or HPDL. The main reason for these large differences \nare thought to be due to the pulsed nature of the beams of the Nd:YAG and excimer lasers, as \nopposed to the CW nature of the CO2 or HPDL beams. Since the interaction time of a pulsed \nbeam with a material is much shorter than that of a CW beam, then consequently the depth of \nthe laser melt\/ablation region will be much smaller due to the reduced time afforded for heat \ntransfer. \n It is also of great importance to consider the surface O2 content of the mild steel before and \nafter treatment with the selected lasers. Increases in the surface O2 content were experienced by \nthe mild steel after interaction with CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL beams, whilst \ninteraction of the mild steel with excimer laser radiation resulted in the surface O2 content of \nthe mild steel decreasing. Such a result is in agreement with the findings of a number of \nworkers [28, 29], who have noted that for many materials, irradiation with an excimer laser \nbeam creates defective energy levels, in particular the formation of O2 vacancies.    \nFrom the previous discussion it is unclear whether after laser surface treatment the surface \nroughness, the microstructural changes or the O2 content alone, or a combination thereof, are \nthe principal factors, influencing the observed changes in the wettability characteristics of the \nmild steel. However, by grinding the surfaces of the untreated and laser treated mild steel \nsamples down the 1\u00b5m, whilst still retaining a laser treated surface, it was thus possible to \nisolate the effects of surface roughness by rendering them non-effective, and investigate at least \nthe effects of the microstructural changes and possibly those of the O2 content.  \nAn examination of the contact angle characteristics of the ground mild steel samples using only \nglycerol revealed that the contact angle was consistently around 300 across the range of \nsamples. In addition, from an XPS analysis the O2 content of the mild steel samples it was \nfound that O2 content of the untreated sample remained around the original value at \n33.8atomic%. For the CO2, the Nd:YAG and the HPDL treated samples, however, the O2 \ncontent was found to have reduced to a level similar to that of the untreated sample \n(34.3atomic%, 32.8atomic% and 33.2atomic% respectively), whilst the excimer laser treated \nsample increased to a level similar to that of the untreated sample (34.0atomic%). Since the \nmeasured contact angles of the ground samples were consistently similar, despite the presence \nof the laser induced microstructures, then, combined with the fact that the O2 content of the \nground samples differed very little, it is evident from these findings that the surface roughness \nalone is the major factor governing the changes in the wettability characteristics of the mild \nsteel.    \n6. Conclusion \nInteraction of CO2 laser Nd:YAG laser, high power diode laser (HPDL) and excimer laser \nradiation with the surface of the mild steel was found to effect changes in the wettability \ncharacteristics of the material. It was observed that interaction of the mild steel with Nd:YAG \nand HPDL radiation effected reductions in the contact angle. In contrast, interaction of the  \nmild steel with CO2 and excimer laser radiation resulted in a slight increase in the contact \n angle. Such changes were identified as being primarily due to: (i) the generation of a smoother \nsurface after Nd:YAG and HPDL treatment due to optimum surface melting and \nresolidification. (ii) the surface roughness of the mild steel increasing after interaction with CO2 \nand excimer laser radiation due to excess surface melting                 and ablation respectively, \nwhich in turn resulted directly in an increase in the contact angle. (iii) changes in the surface O2 \ncontent of the mild steel; increasing after interaction with CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL radiation \ndue to surface melting, and decreased after interaction with the excimer laser due to the \ncreation of defective energy levels. (iv) increases in the polar component of the surface energy \nresulting from the melting and resolidification of the mild steel surface, thus creating a different \nmicrostructure that quite possibly improved the action of wetting and adhesion. However, it \nwas found that changes in the wettability characteristics of the mild steel appeared to be \npredominantly influenced by the surface roughness, whilst the microstructure appeared not to \nhave any effect on the mild steel\u2019s wetting properties. Additionally, surface O2 content is also \nthought to play a minor role.  \nIt is a distinct possibility that a wavelength dependance of the change of the wetting properties \ncan be deduced from the findings of this work. This is apparent from the very similar properties \nof the surfaces irradiated with the Nd:YAG laser and the HPDL, the wavelengths of which vary \nby little more than 66nm. However, it is important to note the high degree to which beam mode \n(temporal and spatial) will influence the laser process. Nonetheless, the work has shown that \nunder the chosen experimental laser operating parameters, changes in the wettability \ncharacteristics of the mild steel were seen to vary depending upon the laser type. \n References \n1.
