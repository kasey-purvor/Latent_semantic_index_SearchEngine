INTRODUCTION \n \n   Electrical trees grow in polymers in regions of high \nelectrical stress [1]. They can propagate through the dielectric \nby means of partial discharge (PD) activity occurring within \nthe existing structure [2]. Therefore, PD activity is a valuable \nindicator for the extent of the electrical tree growth. Previous \nwork [3, 4] on electrical tree growth in a flexible epoxy resin \nhad shown that PD events were determined by a deterministic \nmechanism with chaotic behaviour rather than initiating \nrandomly via a purely stochastic mechanism. Intriguingly, it \nwas also shown that the time scale over which fluctuations in \nthe observed partial discharges occur was related to the \napplied voltage and the branch density of the resultant tree \ngrowth.  \n   The aim of this paper is to study the relationships between \nsome of the statistical parameters traditionally used for PD \npattern recognition and to relate these interrelations to the \nphysical processes that occur within the electrical tree \nstructure during growth.  Correlations between them were \ndetermined, which have to be taken into account when PD \npattern recognition is considered. The importance in \nidentifying and removing the redundancy in the input feature \nvector for reliable PD recognition was demonstrated in [10]. \n \nII.   EXPERIMENTAL \n   Experimental data were gathered from pin-plane electrode \nsamples. Pins made of tungsten and having a shank diameter \nof 1mm and pin-tip radius of 2 \u03bcm were cast into slabs of \nflexible epoxy resin CY 1322GB. The pin-to-plane distance \nwas adjusted to be approximately 2mm. This particular epoxy \nresin has a glass transition temperature of 0C and therefore in \na flexible state under the test temperature of 20C and supports \nthe growth of non-conducting electrical trees [12]. Therefore, \nthe PD amplitudes measured during the tree growth were in \nthe range between 10pC and 10nC depending on the length of \nthe electrical tree. In total six samples were tested at voltage \nlevels 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.5, and 15 kV rms. As reported \npreviously for electrical trees grown in this resin, the fractal \ndimension (or branch density) increased with increasing \napplied voltage amplitude. Trees grown at voltages between 9 \nand 11kV were found to possess a branch type structure \n(fractal dimension <2). Trees grown at voltages above 13.5 kV \nhad bush structure (fractal dimension >2), and that at 12 kV \nforming a composite bush-branch type structure (fractal \ndimension approximately equal to 2).  More details about the \nexperimental set-up can be found in [5], where similar \nequipment was used. \n \nIII.   DATA ANALYSIS \n \n     For each sample at a different test voltage, the phase-\nresolved (q~\u03c6) partial discharge activity was recorded over a \n1s time interval with measurements repeated every 10s \nthroughout the growth of the tree. The measured PD \namplitudes were used to construct pulse magnitude \ndistributions Hn(q) for each time interval. Several statistical \nparameters were calculated for each distribution, namely \nmean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. These \nstatistical parameters are considered to describe \ncomprehensively the shape of the corresponding distribution \nand are widely used in PD pattern recognition [6-9]. Four \ndifferent pulse height distributions Hn(q) can be considered \ntaking into account the polarity of partial discharge \namplitudes: \n\u2022 distribution of the positive PD amplitudes \n\u2022 distribution of the negative PD amplitudes \n\u2022 distribution of positive and negative PD amplitudes (total \ndistribution) \n\u2022 distribution of absolute PD magnitudes. \n   A typical time variation of the statistical parameters is \nillustrated in Fig. 1 for a bush-branch tree grown at an applied \nvoltage 12 kV rms. The time for the tree growth in arbitrary \nunits is shown on the abscissas and the corresponding \nstatistical or physical parameters are on the ordinates.  \n   Several features characterizing the tree growth can be \nobserved in Fig.1. The mean values of the positive and \nnegative PD magnitudes increase in absolute values during the \ntree propagation.  The mean and skewness (odd moments) of \nthe positive and negative PD distributions are symmetrical \nwith respect to the x-axis. On the other hand, the standard \ndeviation and kurtosis (even moments) have approximately \nequal values for both distributions. Consequently, the mean of \nthe total distribution is approximately equal to zero and the \nskewness fluctuates around zero value throughout the tree \npropagation. A mean value of zero throughout the tree growth \ntime implies that there was no build-up of net charge within \nthe tree structure and the symmetry between the two \ndistributions (positive and negative) also implies that a \nrelationship exists between the mechanisms governing the \noccurrence of PDs of both polarities during each half cycle of \nthe applied voltage.  \n   Values of the skewness and kurtosis for positive and \nnegative PD distributions demonstrate that these two \ndistributions are skewed. Also, correlation analysis was \nperformed on the statistical parameters obtained from the \npositive discharge distribution as shown in Table 1 and similar \nresults were obtained from the negative discharge distribution \nand absolute discharge magnitude distribution (not shown). A \nstrong correlation was found between the mean and standard \ndeviation and between the average PD power and standard \ndeviation but less so between skewness and kurtosis. Further \ninvestigation showed that the relationship between the \nskewness and kurtosis is quadratic. In Fig. 2 the square of the \nskewness is plotted against kurtosis, calculated for 1s \nacquisition period and the corresponding linear fits are plotted \nfor the six samples tested. The lines in Fig. 2 are \napproximately parallel, and values of the slopes are between \n1.1 and 1.7. In order to investigate further this relationship, we \nFig. 1.

The corresponding \nfits and data histogram are shown in Fig. 3 for typical 1s \nacquisition interval during the tree growth at voltage 12 kV \nrms. All three distributions resemble relatively well the \nexperimental data and statistically it was not possible to \nestimate the \u201cbest fit\u201d to the data. Therefore, we can assume \nthat any asymmetric distribution having shape similar to the \nabove mentioned distributions could be used to describe PD \ndistributions obtained during tree propagation. \n   In this paper, Gamma distribution has been chosen to \nillustrate the theoretical relationships between the statistical \nparameters of a skewed distribution. The probability density \nfunction (pdf) of Gamma distribution is given by [11]: \nb\nx\na\na\nex\nab\nbaxf 1\n)(\n1\n),(   (1) \nwhere a  is the shape parameter and b is the scale parameter of \nthe distribution.

(4-5) it can be seen that a quadratic relationship \nexists between the skewness and the kurtosis excess and from \nEq.

These theoretical \nrelationships are with close agreement with the experimental \ndata, where linear correlations were found to exist - between \nthe mean and standard deviation, and quadratic one between \nstandard deviation and kurtosis excess.  \n \n \n \nFig. 2.

Fitting Lognormal, Gamma, and Weibull distribution to positive PD \ndata, acquisition time 1s \n \n   Previous work has shown that the dynamical characteristics \nof the PD activity are related to the magnitude of the applied \nvoltage and the fractal dimension of the resultant tree grown. \nThe dynamical characteristics for the 12kV data is shown in \nFig. 1, where the PD activity is found to be non-stationary and \ncharacterized by burst-type behaviour and which is clearly \nrepresented by graphs of the dissipated power and the number \nof discharges. However, this dynamical characteristic of the \npartial discharger activity is not reflected in the corresponding \nvalues for the statistical parameters. For example, in Fig.1 \nvalues calculated for the mean and standard deviation increase \nduring the growth of the tree. The power dissipated (P) in the \nsample as a result of the partial discharges is calculated by the \nfollowing expression: \n  \nN\ni\nii\nN\ni\nii qVqV\nt\nP\n11\n1\n (6) \nsince the acquisition time t  is 1s, \niV - instantaneous voltage \nat the occurrence of the i-th PD pulse, \niq - magnitude of the i-\nth PD pulse, N - number of PD pulses per second.

Therefore, \nwe can neglect the second term to the right in (4), which \nreduces the expression for the standard deviation to: \nN\nqi\nq\n2\n   (11) \nSubstituting (7) and (11) into (9) and rearranging the two \nsides, we can obtain the following expression relating iV , iq  \nand N : \n const\nqN\nqV\ni\nii\n2\n   (7) \nThe above expression was found to be valid for the whole set \nof applied voltages. The value of the constant in (7) is \ndetermined by the magnitude of applied test voltage. \n \nIV.  CONCLUSIONS \n \n   The statistical parameters (mean, standard deviation, \nskewness and kurtosis) are non-stationary and change their \nvalues in the course of the tree growth. \n   Symmetry exists between the positive PD and negative PD \namplitude distributions, which implies that a relation exists \nbetween the mechanisms governing the occurrence of PDs of \nboth polarities. The mean of the total distribution is \napproximately equal to zero during the entire propagation of \nthe tree, which implies that there is no build-up of net charge \nin the tree structure over time. \n   Skewness and kurtosis, as well as mean and standard \ndeviation of the skewed distributions were found to be \ncorrelated. The implication of this fact is that they should not \nbe used simultaneously in a pattern recognition algorithm, \nbecause the inputs of a successful classifier should be \nindependent. \n      A correlation was also obtained between the standard \ndeviation of the total distribution and the average power per \ndischarge, which gives a quantitative relation between the \ninstantaneous voltage, discharge magnitude and number of \ndischarges. This relation was found to be valid for the whole \nset of applied voltages and therefore holds for both bush-type \nand branch type trees. This fact implies that during the course \nof tree growth at a given applied voltage, the average power \nper discharge and hence the energy dissipated per cycle \nincreases with the mean value during the progression of tree \ngrowth with time. However, information concerning the \ndynamical characteristics of the partial discharge activity \n(burst type characteristic that have been shown in the past to \nbe related to the fractal dimension of the tree) was not \nreflected in any of the statistical parameters. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] L.A.
