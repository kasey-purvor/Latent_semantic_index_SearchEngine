The objective was to determine whether the presence of a wax surface, in \nwhich \u03b1-pinene could dissolve and form a high surface concentration, would lead to \nenhanced reaction with O3. The reaction of O3 itself with the empty stainless steel \nreactor and with aluminium and wax surfaces demonstrated an apparent activation \nenergy of around 30 kJ mol-1 for all the surfaces, similar to that observed in long-term \nfield measurements of O3 fluxes to vegetation. However the absolute reaction rate was \n14 times greater for aluminium foil and saturated hydrocarbon wax surfaces than for \nstainless steel, and a further 5 times greater for beeswax than hydrocarbon wax. There \nwas no systematic dependence on either relative or absolute humidity for these \nsurface reactions over the range studied (20-100% RH). Reaction of O3 with \u03b1-pinene \noccurred at rates close to those predicted for the homogeneous gas-phase reaction, and \nwas similar for both the empty reactor and in the presence of wax surfaces. The \nhypothesis of enhanced reaction at leaf surfaces caused by enhanced surface \nconcentrations of \u03b1-pinene was therefore rejected. Comparison of surface \ndecomposition reactions on different surfaces as reported in the literature with the \nresults obtained here demonstrate that the loss of ozone at the earth\u2019s surface by \ndecomposition to molecular oxygen (i.e. without oxidative reaction with a substrate) \ncan account for measured \u2018non-stomatal\u2019 deposition velocities of a few mm s-1. In \norder to quantify such removal, the effective molecular surface area of the vegetation\/\nsoil canopy must be known. Such knowledge, combined with the observed \ntemperature dependence, provides necessary input to global-scale models of O3 \nremoval from the troposphere at the earth\u2019s surface.\nKey words\nSurface fluxes; dry deposition; biogenic VOCs; \u03b1-pinene; ozone destruction; leaf \nsurface wax; epicuticular wax\nIntroduction\nThe removal of ozone (O3) from the atmosphere by deposition at the earth\u2019s surface is \nan important process governing the budget of O3 in the troposphere, and \napproximately balances the transport of O3 downwards from the stratosphere into the \ntroposphere (Lamarque, et al., 2005, Lelieveld and Dentener, 2000). Consequently, it \nis important to be able to measure and model the flux to the ground across a broad \nrange of vegetation types and climatic conditions. Actual measurements of surface \nfluxes are difficult to make, as they are constrained by instrumental availability, and \n1\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nthe need for appropriate micrometeorological conditions in which to make the \nmeasurements. Nevertheless, much progress has been made in understanding the \ncontributory processes and sinks of O3, whether they be to soil, to water, to \nvegetation, or to the canopy space where biogenic emissions of O3-reactive \ncompounds occur.\nInterest in surface fluxes of O3 has also been stimulated because of its reactivity \ntowards plants, and consequent limitations on growth, or occurrence of visible \ndamage symptoms. Several metrics for evaluating exposure, and relating exposure to \neffects, have been developed (Fuhrer, et al., 1997, Mauzerall and Wang, 2001), but \nthere have been moves away from a simple exposure metric (measured as a product of \nO3 concentration and time) to a metric based on the uptake of O3 by plant leaves \nthrough stomata (Emberson, et al., 2000, Musselman and Massman, 1999). \nMeasurements of the stomatal O3 flux are inferred from measurements above plant \ncanopies by assuming that the flux into leaves is proportional to the (measured) water \nvapour flux out of leaves when stomata are open, based simply on the relative rates of \nmolecular diffusion of water vapour and O3 to\/from the sub-stomatal cavity (Altimir, \net al., 2002, Zeller and Nikolov, 2000). The \u2018non-stomatal\u2019 flux is inferred by \nsubtracting the calculated stomatal flux from the measured total flux. There is now a \nsignificant body of published literature for many plant types based on long-term \nmeasurements of O3 fluxes. These measurements have consistently shown that surface \nfluxes can be divided into three components: stomatal uptake (relevant to effects), \n\u2018non-stomatal\u2019 uptake, and gas-phase reactions. Sometimes, the last two processes are \nnot distinguished; the former refers to assumed loss of O3 on plant (or soil) surfaces, \nand the latter refers to reactions of ozone with molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) or \nbiogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in the canopy space, or immediately \nabove the plant canopy, (e.g. Kurpius and Goldstein, 2003). However, the role of \nbiogenic VOCs may not be confined to gas-phase reactions; hydrocarbons dissolve in \nplant surface waxes (Binnie, et al., 2002, Brown, et al., 1998), and may form high \nsurface concentrations, acting as a potential reactive sink in the leaf surface.\nLeaf surfaces are coated with waxes, formed during leaf expansion and development. \nMost of the components of plant waxes (at least for most temperate crop and forest \nspecies) are saturated alkanes or oxygenated alkanes (Jetter, et al., 2006), i.e. without \nany obvious reactive sites for O3. The detailed mechanism of O3 removal by the \u2018non-\nstomatal\u2019 route (i.e. on leaf surfaces) is not known, although several researchers have \ndemonstrated that losses of O3 other than through stomata can be the dominant sink \nfor O3 as an annual budget. A combined measurement and modelling approach for a \nponderosa pine forest in southern California showed that 37% of the annual O3 \nremoval could be explained by in-canopy gas-phase reactions, with 21.5% lost to \nsurfaces and 41.5% to stomata (Kurpius and Goldstein, 2003). Five years of \nmeasurement over a Norway spruce forest in Denmark suggested that stomatal uptake \nonly contributed 21% of the total O3 flux (Mikkelsen, et al., 2004); measurements \nduring summer over a range of different vegetation types, when stomatal uptake might \nbe expected to be at a maximum, gave values between 14 and 69% of the total \n(Cieslik, 2004); long-term measurements over moorland showed stomatal uptake \ncontributing only 30% of the total over 4 years (Fowler, et al., 2001). In these \nexamples no distinction was made between surface uptake and gas-phase reaction. \nHowever, the overall removal rate can depend markedly on surface wetness (Altimir, \n2\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\net al., 2006, Fuentes, et al., 1992, Grantz, et al., 1997, Grantz, et al., 1995, Lamaud, et \nal., 2002, Pleijel, et al., 1995), suggesting a major role for surface removal. Both \ninhibition and enhancement of O3  fluxes to wet surfaces have been observed, \ndepending on the plant species under investigation. \nThis paper presents a study using simulated leaf surfaces to test the specific \nhypothesis that surface reaction of O3 with (dissolved) BVOCs can occur on leaf \nsurfaces, thereby enhancing the surface flux of O3. The reaction rate of O3 with \u03b1-\npinene has been measured in the absence and in the presence of wax-covered surfaces, \nsimulating the epicuticular surfaces of plant leaves. The reaction rate was studied over \na range of ambient temperatures and humidity.\nMethods\nReaction chamber\nAll experiments took place in a Conviron CMP 3246 controlled environment exposure \ncabinet, which enabled the overall control of temperature and relative humidity. The \nreaction chamber itself, placed inside the cabinet, was made from stainless steel, with \ninternal dimensions of 0.5 m \u00d7 0.5 m \u00d7 1 m. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the \nexperimental system. Oxygen from an external cylinder was supplied to an electric \ndischarge O3 generator (Dryden Aqua OZ500); for most experiments a constant O3 \nproduction rate was used, which gave a concentration in the reaction chamber of \naround 130 ppb (parts in 109 by volume). The O3 source was diluted by charcoal-\nfiltered air pumped from within the cabinet; average flow rates of around 0.02 m3 \nmin-1 were recorded using a dry-gas meter placed upstream of the pump. The exhaust \nair from the chamber was vented to the outside of the building through a mirror \ndewpoint meter (Michell Instruments Series 3000). Temperatures inside the chamber \nwere recorded using a chromel\/alumel K-type thermocouple. \nThe inlet O3 sampling line (0.125\u201d o.d. stainless steel) was sealed to the interior of the \nchamber so as to sample from the inlet air as it entered the chamber, thereby ensuring \nthat sampling was undertaken at the chamber internal pressure, rather than the slightly \nhigher pressure of the inlet tube itself. The outlet air stream was sampled immediately \ndownstream of the reaction chamber. The inlet and outlet air streams were alternately \nsampled over five minute periods, using a 3-way stainless steel solenoid valve \ncontrolled by a Campbell Scientific 21X micrologger. The first minute\u2019s data after \nswitching the valve were not used for data analysis. O3 concentrations in the inlet and \noutlet air were measured using a Thermo Environmental Instruments 49C O3 analyser \n(dual channel, UV absorption, nominal precision 1 ppb). Mixing within the chamber \nwas achieved using a stainless steel fan mounted on one wall; the efficiency of mixing \nwas measured by using an O3-reactive surface sink to assess the maximum surface \nflux achievable (see later).\nMethods for generating controlled \u03b1-pinene concentrations\n\u03b1-Pinene was introduced into the chamber using a diffusion source. After several \ntrials of different methods, a reliable source with the appropriate release rate to \nprovide an air concentration of around 100 \u03bcg m-3 was devised by placing 0.5 ml pure \n\u03b1-pinene (Sigma-Aldrich, as received) in a 2 ml glass sample vial sealed with a \npolyethylene plug (Chromacol) that was slightly permeable to the vapour. The vial \nwas maintained at the constant temperature of the cabinet inside a glass bottle through \n3\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nwhich a charcoal-filtered air flow of around 0.002 m3 min-1 was maintained, leading \ninto the reaction chamber. Measurements made over a period of up to 24 days and \nover a range of temperatures (5 to 35 \u00baC) showed that the rate of mass loss was \napproximately linear for a given vial, at ca. 3 mg d-1. The rate varied from vial to vial \nand was not predictably related to temperature, so the mass of each sample vial was \nmeasured at the beginning and end of each experiment, and the average \u03b1-pinene \nconcentration was calculated based on the change in mass and the measured overall \nair flow rate through the chamber.\nMethods for producing wax surfaces\nTo prepare a model leaf surface, a stainless steel plate (0.31 m \u00d7 0.71 m) was covered \nwith a pre-weighed sheet of aluminium foil as a substrate for wax deposition. For the \nexperiments a target wax coverage of 1 mg cm-2 was used, equivalent to 2.20 g for the \narea of the steel plate. This mass of wax was dissolved in 25 ml of dichloromethane at \n40 \u00baC then decanted in 3 aliquots into a small glass bottle attached to a spray nebulizer \n(Badger Airbrush) driven by a compressed gas propellant. The contents of the bottle \nwere then evenly sprayed onto the foil-covered plate in a fume cupboard. Rapid \nevaporation of the dichloromethane produced an even coating of wax on the Al foil. \nThe process was repeated with the remaining two aliquots to ensure that the plate was \nadequately covered. The actual mass of wax on the foil surface was determined by \nweighing the wax-coated foil at the end of each experiment. \nData analysis techniques\nThe removal of O3 within the empty reaction chamber was calculated from the \ndifference in O3 concentrations between the inlet and outlet (\u2206[O3]), the air flow rate \n(F), the internal surface wall area (A) and the well-mixed (outlet) concentration [O3], \nto give a removal \u2018resistance\u2019 (Rw) having units of s m-1:\nFO\nAO\nRw ].[\n].[\n3\n3\n\u2206\n= (1)\nRw was measured as a function of temperature between 10 and 35 \u00b0C. This overall \nresistance comprises a turbulent transfer resistance to the surface (Rt) and a surface \nresistance (Rs), acting in series.\nThe mass flux of O3 to the stainless steel walls of the chamber is given by:\n [O3]\/Rw  g m-2 s-1 \nwhere concentration is expressed in g m-3, \nand the loss rate to the walls is then:\nA.[O3]\/Rw  = \u2206[O3].F    g s-1.\nIn order to estimate the transfer resistance (Rt), which was assumed to be invariant for \nfixed air flow rates and fan mixing speed, a sheet of plastic-backed absorbent paper, \nthoroughly wetted with potassium iodide solution (which reacts rapidly with O3) was \nintroduced into the base of the chamber. The overall loss of O3 measured as \u2206[O3].F \nwas then equated to the loss to the steel walls (A-Aabs).[O3]\/Rw plus the loss to the \nabsorbent surface Aabs.[O3]\/Rabs, where Aabs is the area of the absorbent paper.  The \nvalue of Rabs  = Rt + (Rs)abs can thus be obtained, and is taken to be equivalent to Rt, on \nthe assumption that (Rs)abs is effectively zero for the reactive absorbent surface. Four \nreplicate experiments over a period of a month gave a value for Rabs ~ Rt of 206 (\u00b1 25) \n4\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\ns m-1. This is negligible relative to typical values of Rw of around  3 \u00d7 104 s m-1 (see \nbelow), and indicates good mixing within the reaction chamber.\nIn order to test the uptake of O3 by different surfaces, the steel plate covered in a sheet \nof aluminium foil (with and without a wax coating) was introduced, and a similar set \nof calculations undertaken using the values of Rw and Rt to measure Rs for the different \nsurfaces over a range of temperatures.\nA similar calculation was done in the presence of \u03b1-pinene, where an additional O3 \nloss term was included:\n\u2206[O3].F = (A-As).[O3]\/Rw + As.[O3]\/Rs + k.V.[O3].[\u03b1-pinene] (2)\nwhere V is the volume of the reaction chamber (0.25 m3).\nIn this case the reaction rate coefficient (k, m3g-1s-1) includes both the homogeneous \ngas-phase reactions of O3 with \u03b1-pinene, and any reactions occurring at the walls or \nother surfaces in the chamber. Only the inlet concentration of \u03b1-pinene is known \n(from the diffusion source), so the effective well-mixed concentration of \u03b1-pinene to \nbe used in Equation 2 was calculated by assuming that the initial reaction with O3 had \nunit molar stoichiometry. In a typical experiment, \u03b1-pinene was introduced to the \nchamber and allowed to equilibrate with the wax-coated Al foil (2-3 h) before \nintroduction of O3. After a new equilibrium had been established, the reaction rate \nwas measured, then the \u03b1-pinene source was turned off, and a new equilibrium was \nestablished for the box containing the wax plate. The reaction rate with \u03b1-pinene was \ntaken as the simple difference between the two reaction rates, with and without \u03b1-\npinene present. In some experiments the \u03b1-pinene source was repeatedly attached and \nremoved; no significant hysteresis was observed.\nResults\nEmpty box (reaction of O3 with stainless steel)\nOver 50 experiments were conducted over a period of 14 months, at temperatures \nbetween 8 and 33 \u00b0C and dew points between 6 and 19 \u00b0C. There was a strong \ndependence of the surface resistance (Rs) on temperature (Figure 2), and although \nthere was some variation between experiments, this was not related to water vapour \nconcentration, whether expressed as absolute or relative humidity. The dependence \ncan be expressed in an Arrhenius form:\nln(Rs) = 31.3 (\u00b1 4.1) \u00d7 103\/RT + 0.2 (\u00b1 1.7) (3)\nwhere the error terms are the standard errors of the fitted parameters. The Pearson \ncorrelation coefficient (r2) was 0.52. This implies a reaction with an activation energy \nof 31 kJ mol-1. In all, 22 experiments were conducted at a temperature of 23.5 (\u00b1 0.3) \n\u00b0C, with an average absolute value of Rs of 4.4 (\u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 105 s m-1; the predicted value \nfrom Equation 3 is 4.0 \u00d7 105 s m-1.\nThere was some evidence of a general increase in variability over time. The data from \nthe 24 experiments in April 2005 were best fitted by:\n5\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nln(Rs) = 40.1 (\u00b1 3.8) \u00d7 103\/RT - 3.28 (\u00b1 1.55) (4)\nwith an r2 of 0.84,\nwhile the data from the 31 experiments in June 2006 were best fitted by:\nln(Rs) = 15.2 (\u00b1 5.9) \u00d7 103\/RT + 6.6 (\u00b1 2.4) (5)\nbut this relationship, although statistical significant, had an r2 of only 0.19.\nThe respective predicted and measured values at 23.5 \u00b0C were 4.3 \u00d7 105 s m-1 (Eqn.4) \n(measured 4.5 (\u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 105) and 3.5 \u00d7 105 s m-1 (Eqn.5) (measured 4.4 (\u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 105), \nrespectively.\nIn the following calculations for estimating fluxes to other surfaces in the reaction \nchamber, the rate of loss to the steel walls (which must be subtracted from the overall \nozone loss to obtain the rate of loss to the other surface) was calculated using either \nEquation 4 or Equation 5, depending on the date of the experiments.\nFlux to aluminium foil\nAluminium foil was used as a substrate for building the artificial leaf surfaces, so the \nflux and reaction of O3 with the bare surface was measured in a series of 30 \nexperiments over a range of temperatures. The results are shown in Figure 2. The \ntypical uncertainty (combined error from the calculation) for each value is 15%. As \nfor the steel walls, the surface flux increased with temperature with an apparent \nactivation energy of 25 (\u00b1 8) kJ mol-1. The reaction rate with Al foil was significantly \ngreater than with stainless steel; the predicted Rs at 23.5 \u00b0C was 2.8 \u00d7 104 s m-1 \ncompared with 4.0 \u00d7 105 s m-1 for steel.\nFlux to paraffin wax\nThe first artificial leaf surface to be constructed was made from paraffin wax (melting \npoint 49-52 \u00b0C, Fisher Chemicals, Loughborough, UK, used as received) as described \nabove, with an average wax loading of 0.4 mg cm-2 on the Al foil. The results are \nshown in Figure 2, again with an apparent activation energy, of 23 (\u00b1 19) kJ mol-1, \nalthough the uncertainty on this is much larger than for the uncoated foil, partly \nbecause of the smaller number of experiments (9). The absolute values of Rs were not \nsignificantly different from those for the substrate Al foil. No effect of differences in \nsurface coverage was observed.\nFlux to beeswax\nBeeswax was chosen as a potentially ozone-reactive wax, as it contains unsaturated \nlong-chain hydrocarbons. The surface flux to beeswax (refined, yellow, ACROS \nOrganics, Geel, Belgium, used as received) was significantly faster than to paraffin \nwax, even though the coverage achieved in the experiments was variable, and on \naverage only 0.1 mg cm-2. The apparent activation energy from 10 experiments at a \nrange of temperatures was 16 (\u00b1 6) kJ mol-1, and there was no obvious dependence on \nthe wax coverage achieved. However, the overall rate of reaction was almost 5 times \ngreater than to paraffin wax or Al foil, with an estimated Rs at 23.5 \u00b0C of 6.0 \u00d7 103 s \nm-1. This surface resistance is still 30 times greater than the estimated gas-phase \ntransfer resistance (Rt) measured for the \u2018perfect\u2019 sink surface, so reaction rates at the \nsurface were controlled by the surface itself rather than by rates of transfer from the \ngas-phase.\n6\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nReactions with \u03b1-pinene\nAn initial set of experiments investigated the reactions of O3 with \u03b1-pinene in the \nempty steel box. The loss of O3 in the box was measured with and without the \naddition of a known mass flow of \u03b1-pinene, and the difference in O3 loss is attributed \nto the sum of the gas-phase reaction of O3 with \u03b1-pinene and any reactions which may \nhave occurred on the wall surfaces. A set of 7 experiments, all at 23.5 \u00b0C, gave an \neffective rate coefficient for the reaction of  1.4 (\u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10-16 cm3 molec-1 s-1, where \nthe uncertainty is the standard deviation (n = 7). Introduction of the Al foil made little \ndifference to the effective rate coefficient, for 5 experiments at 3.6 \u00b0C and 2 \nexperiments at 33.5 \u00b0C (Figure 3), where the values of k were 8.6 (\u00b1 2.1) \u00d7 10-17 cm3 \nmolec-1 s-1 and 2.0 (\u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10-16 cm3 molec-1 s-1, respectively.\nThe original hypothesis \u2013 that O3 and \u03b1-pinene react on leaf surfaces in addition to the \ngas-phase, because of the presence of epicuticular waxes \u2013 was then tested by reacting \n\u03b1-pinene with O3 with a wax-coated foil surface in the chamber. In these experiments, \nthe \u03b1-pinene was introduced first and allowed to equilibrate with the wax surface \nbefore the O3 was introduced, and the steady-state removal rate measured. The \u03b1-\npinene source was then removed, and the subsequent reaction of O3 with the surfaces \nin the box was measured, again after several hours equilibration, by which time any \u03b1-\npinene that had been adsorbed on the wax surface would have desorbed and left the \nreactor. The results of 2 experiments at each of 3 temperatures (3.6, 23.5 and 33.7 \u00b0C) \nare shown in Figure 3. The reaction rate between O3 and \u03b1-pinene in the presence of a \nwax surface is not significantly different from that with the empty box, i.e. the \nhypothesis that the solution \/adsorption of \u03b1-pinene in the surface wax leads to \nenhanced removal of O3 by reaction with adsorbed \u03b1-pinene, has to be rejected. \nSimilar results were found in 6 experiments with beeswax (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nInterest in the rate of reaction of O3 with surfaces has led to experimental studies by a \nrange of different researchers: losses of O3 to dust particles in the atmosphere, such as \nsoot (Kamm, et al., 1999), or mineral dust (Hanisch and Crowley, 2003, Sullivan, et \nal., 2004), have been studied in a variety of experimental systems. As part of these \nstudies, loss rates to \u2018inert\u2019 surfaces have also been measured. Although there have \nbeen no controlled laboratory measurements of loss rates to plant leaf surfaces prior to \nthis study, interest in O3 losses and reactions in indoor environments has led to several \nstudies of O3 reaction on the surfaces of building materials and furnishings (Gr\u00f8ntoft \nand Raychaudhuri, 2004, Nicolas, et al., 2007), particularly in aircraft (Coleman, et \nal., 2008). The deliberate removal of O3 from air has received considerable interest in \nterms of suitable catalysts (Dhandapani and Oyama, 1997) or absorbents such as \nactivated charcoal . Each discipline has used slightly different methods of expressing \ntheir results: the rate of O3 loss may be expressed in terms of the reaction probability \n(\u03b3), or as a deposition velocity (vd), with appropriate correction for the rate of transfer \nof O3 molecules to the reacting surface. These different measures may be related to \nthe surface resistance (Rs) used in this study by the following:\nRs = 1\/vd  , where vd is corrected for turbulent transfer to the surface\n7\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nRs = 4\/(\u03b3.<v>)  , where <v> is the mean Boltzmann collision velocity for O3 molecules \nat a surface, dependent upon (temperature)1\/2 and molecular mass, and equivalent to \n360 m s-1 at 293 K.\nIn some experiments, results are expressed in terms of a first-order rate coefficient for \nwall reactions (k) that can be related to Rs by:\nRs = A\/(k.V) , where A and V are the internal surface area and volume of the reactor, \nrespectively.\nGiven these conversion equations, the results from this experiment can be set in the \ncontext of a wide range of similar data relating to reaction and\/or decomposition of O3 \non solid surfaces. A summary of O3 fluxes to a range of relevant surfaces is shown in \nTable 1, converted into the same units of surface resistance (Rs) as given above. Many \nof these refer to instantaneous reaction rates, which change with time during an \nexperiment, rather than those that would apply at equilibrium under steady-state \nconditions, as in our experiments.\nThere have been few systematic studies of the temperature-dependence of this \nreaction, although an apparent activation energy for reaction with dry soot aerosol \nduring the \u2018slow reaction\u2019 phase of 46 kJ mol-1 has been measured (Kamm, et al., \n1999). Although this is similar to the values observed in this study (Figure 2), the \nreaction with soot is undoubtedly more complex than with the \u2018inert\u2019 surfaces used \nhere (steel, Al foil and wax), but may reflect the underlying energy dependence of the \nheterogeneous decomposition of O3 to O2 which is suggested as the rate-determining \nstep. In many of the studies with mineral dust aerosols, surfaces show a very rapid \nuptake of O3 followed by a slower rate of O3 loss, and gradual deactivation of the \nsurface, accompanied by evolution of molecular O2 (Karagulian and Rossi, 2006). In \nour study, the initial reaction rate was not recorded, only the steady-state condition \nafter several hours\u2019 exposure. \nThe effects of humidity have been studied in some experiments, although many of the \nmeasurements have been made in totally dry air, in very different conditions from \nthose that would obtain in the real troposphere. Where O3 loss rates have been \nmeasured explicitly as a function of humidity, initial rapid reaction rates in dry air \nwere greatly reduced as humidity increased, leading to a lower \u2018plateau\u2019 at RH > 30% \n(Mogili, et al., 2006). This behaviour is interpreted as competition between water \nvapour and O3 molecules for active sites on the aerosol surface, and the eventual \naccumulation of several monolayers of water on the surface at RH > 30%. However, \nfor \u2018aged\u2019 or reactive surfaces, the surface resistance tends to decrease as humidity \nincreases (Table 1), but in some experiments no dependence on humidity was \nobserved (Sullivan, et al., 2004). These observations confirm the lack of humidity \ndependence noted in our study, where RH varied only between 20 and 100%, and \n\u2018aged\u2019 surfaces were used. In controlled experiments with artificial mineral substrates, \nsurface wetness or layers of water on the surface would not lead to the dissolution or \nleaching of O3-reactive materials, and the reaction of O3 at the surface may appear \nsimilar to reaction with pure water, albeit modified by being constrained to a surface \nlayer (Gr\u00f8ntoft, et al., 2004). However, for potentially reactive surfaces such as wood \nor leaves, surface wetness may also lead to leaching or dissolution of materials from \n8\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nthe surface, and these (rather than simple decomposition of O3) may determine the \nactual surface resistance and surface flux of O3 to field-grown plants.\nIn general, the initial reaction rates with surfaces are reported to be higher at smaller \nconcentrations of O3, interpreted as a feature of surface saturation of reactive sites, \nalbeit partially reversible by removing O3. The initial rates reported in Table 1 refer to \na system which is not in steady state, in contrast to the conditions in our experiments, \nwhere the observed removal rates are under thermodynamic rather than kinetic \ncontrol. In one study (Mogili, et al., 2006), the reaction rate at high humidity appeared \nto be zero-order in O3. The order of the reaction was not studied in our experiments, \nbecause the inlet O3 concentration was approximately constant. \nThe following conclusions may be drawn from Table 1: \u2018inert\u2019 surfaces such as glass, \nPTFE or stainless steel have high surface resistances, while Al has a lower surface \nresistance, possibly because metallic Al exposed to the atmosphere is covered in a \nthin oxide (Al2O3) layer, and therefore behaves in a similar way to Al2O3 aerosol \nparticles, which have been the subject of several experimental studies (Mogili, et al., \n2006, Sullivan, et al., 2004, Usher, et al., 2003). Non-reactive (alkane) wax layers \nmight be expected to show similar reactivity to paints or plastics, and this is indeed \nobserved, while untreated wood surfaces are more reactive, and approach the \nreactivity of living plant material. \nThe results presented above for reactions in the absence of \u03b1-pinene show that the \n\u2018steady-state\u2019 loss of O3 on \u2018inert\u2019 surfaces is temperature-dependent, with a common \napparent activation energy of around 30 kJ mol-1. This suggests that O3 is lost through \nheterogeneous decomposition at the surface. The absolute reaction rate depends on \nother properties of the surface; stainless steel was least reactive of all the surfaces \nstudied, approximately 14 times less reactive (as measured by the surface resistance) \nthan aluminium foil or paraffin wax. This is consistent with earlier data (see Table 1), \nwhere Rs for stainless steel was 6.5 times greater than for aluminium when measured \nin the same apparatus (Cano-Ruiz, et al., 1993). The additional reactivity of \naluminium (coated in a surface layer of Al2O3) may relate to the availability of surface \nreaction sites for O3 adsorption and reaction, as noted by authors who have \ninvestigated O3 uptake and reaction on Al2O3 aerosols (Mogili, et al., 2006, Sullivan, \net al., 2004, Usher, et al., 2003).  \nThe similar reactivity of the paraffin wax surface may reflect the full saturation of the \nwax molecules, in contrast to polyethylene, which appears to be more reactive (lower \nRs) than aluminium when compared in the same experiment (Table 1). Although \nchemically similar to a saturated wax surface, the polymer may still contain a \nsignificant number of reactive sites for O3. The 5-times greater reactivity of beeswax \nin our experiments can be ascribed to the presence of unsaturated molecules in the \nbeeswax, and\/or may be because of a rougher surface structure. An experiment using \nC8-alkene and C8-alkane coatings on silica particles showed a 2-fold larger initial \nreaction rate for an alkene-coated surface than an alkane-coated surface (Usher, et al., \n2003). The absolute resistances for these reactions in Table 1 refer to the initial \nreaction rates, which decreased markedly with exposure time, so cannot be compared \ndirectly with the values obtained in our experiments.\n9\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nIn studies of powders and building materials, the accessible surface area (as opposed \nto the geometric surface area) is explicitly measured as an important factor in \nnormalising the chemical reaction rate. For vegetation, this is explicitly taken into \naccount in many dry deposition models, even though deposition velocities (and \nsurface resistances) measured above a vegetation canopy are usually expressed in \nterms of the geometric land area below the measurement point. This has to be \nmultiplied by the (two-sided) leaf area index (LAI) as a measure of the effective \nsurface area accessible for O3 destruction. Moreover, the fine-scale structure of leaf \nsurfaces, which may be covered in trichomes or semi-crystalline epicuticular waxes, \nshould also be considered. For example, a Scots pine needle surface is covered in C29-\nalkanol wax tubes, typically 1.5 \u00b5m long and 150 nm in diameter, at a density of 10 \ntubes \u00b5m-2 (Crossley and Fowler, 1986), leading to an increase in surface area by a \nfactor of 7 relative to a smooth wax surface, even without consideration of the \neffective area at the molecular scale. The effective area available for O3 destruction of \na plant canopy with a (two-sided) LAI of 5, typical of a Scots pine forest (Bealde, et \nal., 1982), may therefore be over 30 times the ground area, and it should therefore not \nbe surprising that the surface resistance for O3 loss to vegetation is as low as several \nhundred s m-1 when the surface resistance for an \u2018inert\u2019 smooth wax surface is 3 \u00d7 104 \ns m-1, as measured in this study. No chemical reaction of O3 with a reactive substance \nat the surface is required \u2013 the heterogeneous decomposition of O3 to molecular O2 \nwould be expected to occur at rates similar to this on all surfaces exposed to a humid \natmosphere.\nConclusions\nOzone is generally regarded as having a very low rate of reaction or decomposition at \n\u2018inert\u2019 surfaces, as shown for stainless steel in the experimental results reported here. \nFor more polar surfaces, because of surface oxide groups and\/or the presence of thin \nlayers of water molecules (as would be expected for polar surfaces in most \ntropospheric situations), the decomposition of O3 is enhanced relative to \u2018inert\u2019 \nsurfaces, even on surfaces that are well \u2018aged\u2019 and where specific surface reaction \nsites have been reacted or blocked. The apparent activation energy for this reaction is \naround 30 kJ mol-1, leading to an increase in the removal rate at the surface with \nambient temperatures by a factor of 2 between 9 and 25 \u00b0C.  The absolute reaction \nrate appears to depend on the effective surface area at a microscopic scale. Although \nthis is explicitly recognised when dealing with dusts or aerosols, it may not be \nappreciated just how great the effective surface of a plant canopy may be for O3 \nremoval. A simple calculation for one type of forest indicates that this area may be \nover 30 times the ground area. Consequently, a surface resistance of 3 \u00d7 104 s m-1 for a \nsmooth \u2018inert\u2019 surface measured in the laboratory at >50% relative humidity could \ncorrespond to a canopy surface resistance of a few hundred s m-1 (equivalent to a \ndeposition velocity of a few mm s-1) if the only process removing O3 was \ndecomposition at the complex surface of the foliage. In the presence of light, with the \npotential for photolytic processes to contribute to O3 reactions, and in the presence of \na range of material present on the canopy surface (from prior deposition, from biota \non the leaf surface, or from leaching from inside the leaf), the potential removal rate at \na canopy could be very much greater. If such processes are to be incorporated \nexplicitly into models of the removal of O3 at the earth\u2019s surface, for example for use \nin global climate and chemistry modelling, then the above measurements give an \nindication of the likely temperature response, and indicate the need for the \n10\nAtmospheric Environment (2009) 43\/5, 1116-1123\nmeasurement or estimation of the actual canopy surface responsible for the removal of \nO3 by heterogeneous decomposition.\nReferences\nAltimir N., Kolari P., Tuovinen J.P., Vesala T., Back J., Suni T., Kulmala M., Hari P., \n2006.
