Introduction\nThe growing popularity of multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs), such as Second Life,\nand massive multi-player online role-playing games (MMPORG) like World of Warcraft\nhas led to an increased interest in the use of such technologies for learning. However,\ndifferent types of collaborative virtual gaming environments have actually been used for\nmany years, and this paper aims to explore the wider context of these worlds and their\npotential for learning.\nThe focus here is unashamedly on the use of virtual gaming and multi-user environments\nwith adults in the UK higher education sector. This is an area that the authors feel is often\nneglected in terms of research, or where assumptions are transferred from research with\nchildren or other groups; for example that games are a suitable educational tool because they\nallegedly lead to increased student motivation, which is not necessarily the case with adult\nlearners, who may be time-poor and more strategic in their learning (Beasley and Crerar\n2005). The authors acknowledge that research into the application of games and simulations\nfor learning has a rich history, particularly in the military, corporate and health sectors, but\n*Corresponding author. Email: n.whitton@mmu.ac.uk\n222  N. Whitton and P. Hollins\nthe focus of this paper is primarily on the use of games to teach higher-level cognitive skills\nwithin higher education.\nThis paper adopts an inclusive definition of an immersive virtual gaming world, so is\nnot restricted to massively multi-user graphical online environments, but refers here to any\ncomputer-based environment that shares one or more game-like characteristics, including\nan environment that can be explored, a competitive element, a fantasy setting, goals, rules\nand outcomes, and interaction with others. The number of users in this broad definition can\nrange from one to millions; as even single-user environments can still be collaborative, for\nexample, by users working synchronously while using the environment. The fidelity of a\nvirtual environment can vary from being entirely text-based, to using still images, two-\ndimensional or three-dimensional graphics. \nUsing collaborative gaming environments to teach is not a new concept, with organisa-\ntions such as the Society for the Advancement of Games and Simulations in Education and\nTraining (SAGSET) dating back more than 35 years (van Ments 1995). However, the\nubiquity of online collaborative communities and use of large-scale virtual worlds, coupled\nwith the ever-growing power of computing technology, have increased the potential of\ncomputer-based collaborative learning in a way simply not possible before.\nThis paper will first consider the pedagogic benefits of collaborative game-based virtual\nworlds in relation to established constructivist theories of teaching and learning. It will then\ndiscuss some of the practical issues associated with using virtual worlds to teach in higher\neducation. Next, options for the development and creation of virtual environments are\npresented, and the paper concludes by discussing some of the benefits and challenges of\nusing virtual worlds.\n2. Pedagogy in virtual gaming worlds\nCollaborative virtual gaming environments can support a variety of pedagogic approaches\nand can be applied, for example, as both constructivist learning environments and as didactic\ninstructional tools. This paper is concerned primarily with the constructivist perspective,\nwhich hypothesises that people learn by developing their own views about the world, by\nproblem-solving and personal discovery. The design of student-centred online learning envi-\nronments has been very much influenced by the constructivist perspective (e.g. Grabinger,\nDunlap, and Duffield 1997; Land and Hannafin 2000). Honebein (1996) presents pedagogic\ngoals of the design of constructivist learning environments in that they should: encourage\nstudents to take responsibility for their learning, including what and how they learn; provide\nmultiple perspectives; create self-awareness of the learning process; make learning relevant\nand authentic; make learning a collaborative and interactive social experience; and use multi-\nple modes of representation and rich media. Immersive virtual environments can provide the\nopportunity for learners to explore and navigate worlds using a range of media types, with\nauthentic and purposeful contexts for practising learning that can be transferred to the real\nworld, and they can present a context for problem-solving and interaction with others. The\nSimPLE project at The University of Strathclyde graduate law school (Hughes 2006) is a\ncase that exemplifies this approach. It has created a \u2018trading zone\u2019 in virtual space, which\nprovides students with bounded activities and \u2018open fields of practice\u2019 of self-directed\nactivity in order to construct their own understandings.\nWorking collaboratively enables students to work to their strengths, develop critical\nthinking skills and creativity, validate their ideas, and appreciate a range of individual learn-\ning styles, skills, preferences and perspectives (McConnell 2000; Palloff and Pratt 2003).\nParticipating in communities of practice provides a legitimate and ongoing way of learning\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   223\nfrom others as part of a group through apprenticeship and education in the context of the\ngroup norms, processes and identity (Lave and Wenger 1991). Online gaming communities\nprovide a similar platform for collaboration and the ability to learn with others. For exam-\nple, studies of leisure users of massively multi-user online role-playing games (MMORPGs)\nhave found evidence of collaborative learning, development of communities of practice\n(Steinkuehler 2004) as well as the potential for learning a range of group skills, including\nthe etiquette of meeting people, group management, co-operation and social interaction\n(Ducheneaut and Moore 2005).\nThe constructivist perspective also puts forward the idea that students learn better by\nexperiencing for themselves and discovering their own meanings from their experiences.\nGee (2003) argues that computer games reflect the experiential learning cycle (Kolb 1984)\nin that students must examine the virtual environment, reflect on the situation to form a\nhypothesis, further investigate the virtual world and see what effect their action has. While\nit is true that this cycle maps onto learning within the game world, it does not necessarily\nprovide students with scope for meta-cognitive processes and reflection outside of the\nvirtual world. Prensky (2001) argues that if games were used for learning, then \u201clearning\nwould happen almost without the learners realizing it, in pursuit of beating the game\u201d\n(26). In the context of higher education, without the opportunity to support learners to\nunderstand the process, context and transferability of learning, the value of learning\nundertaken in this way is questionable. In relation to reflection, Prensky (2001) argues\nthat reflection does occur within games, only at a greater speed, or \u201ctwitch speed\u201d as he\ndefines it, although this assertion is controversial. It is important to recognise that learning\nin virtual environments may be part of a larger process and other activities \u2013 including\nformal and informal \u2018affinity groups\u2019 or communities, and reflective practice \u2013 often\nsurround their use.\nAlthough many first year undergraduates may have more in common with school-based\nlearners, there is a growing representation of mature learners in higher education. These\nindividuals typically have more work and personal responsibilities, caring commitments\nand greater life experience. Adult learning theory (Knowles 1998) argues that adult learning\n(or \u2018androgogy\u2019) is different from children\u2019s learning and that the key characteristics of\nadult learners are that they need to know why they need to know something before they are\nwilling to invest time and energy in learning it, they have a deep psychological need to be\nself-directing and to take responsibility for their learning, become ready to learn something\nwhen they need to know it to be able to use it in real-life, and are task-oriented in their\nlearning.\nAdult learning theory highlights the fact that motivation to learn is paramount and\nthat learning activities must be purposeful for students to engage. This brings into ques-\ntion the acceptability of learning in virtual worlds with adult learners, who may perceive\nthese environments as frivolous and time-wasting. There are misconceptions associated\nwith play that might affect the acceptability of game-based learning, for both adults in\nhigher education and children in school-based learning contexts (Egenfeldt-Neilson\n2005), in that it is perceived by many as only for young children, as not being a respect-\nable thing to do, and as an activity that is easy (Rieber 1996) or that the learning is\nsomehow inauthentic.\nAlthough outside the scope of this paper, it is also recognised that immersive virtual\nworlds can be used in the behaviourist tradition as tools for skill development in higher\neducation in the sciences or medical domains.\nWhile collaborative virtual gaming environments have the potential to engage students\nand support authentic, experiential and collaborative learning, there are many practical\n224  N. Whitton and P. Hollins\nissues associated with their use in higher education, which are discussed in the following\nsection.\n3. Virtual gaming worlds in practice\nThere are many practical considerations when using virtual gaming worlds in learning and\nteaching in higher education. Foremost, it is essential to have a clear educational purpose\nfor their use, and not simply because they are thought to be motivational. While computer\ngames may be motivating for some, this is often not the case for adult learners, who may be\nmore strategic in what and how they learn and will look to learn things in the most appro-\npriate way (Knowles 1998). However, while adult learners may not be interested in learning\nwith a game for its own sake, there is evidence that they will be happy to use them if they\nare perceived as an effective way to learn in that context (Whitton 2007).\nMatching the in-world outcomes with the intended learning outcomes from use is\nanother key issue. If the use of the environment does not closely match the curriculum, then\nstudents may be learning something, but it may not be relevant to the course of study. Built\nin to many entertainment games is the goal of learning to play the game itself, mastering the\ninterface and discovering advanced features, which may detract from the learning value of\nthe game.\nOther practicalities such as the amount of time available both to develop or modify the\ngaming world and to use in teaching, space, whether a course is online or face-to-face, and\nresources available (e.g. access to computers with correct specifications) will also influence\nhow and when gaming worlds can be integrated into teaching and learning. An issue often\narises in university settings with gaming worlds being seen as inappropriate or with commu-\nnications ports being automatically locked so that software can not be accessed; three-\ndimensional immersive worlds also often require higher specifications of graphics cards or\nprocessors than are typical in university machines. University regulations may also affect\nhow these worlds can be integrated and assessed, and impact on whether the use of a virtual\ngaming world is a supplemental activity, single or multiple use, or fundamental to the whole\nstructure and design of a course; they can also affect whether, and how, learning in gaming\nworlds is assessed. It is particularly important to separate achievement in the gaming\nenvironment with achievement in the assessment so as not to disadvantage students who\nmight be performing less well for reasons that are nothing to do with their level of learning\n(e.g. students who have problems navigating in a three-dimensional environment). Well-\ndesigned assessment can encourage the development and integration of reflective and\ncollaborative activities, for example considering how progress through the game could have\nbeen different in different circumstances, or working with others to produce a reflective\nreport.\nWhile gaming environments may provide experiential learning spaces, they do not\nnecessarily provide students with scope for reflection and application of their learned\nknowledge and skills to the real world. Activities such as debriefing and structured\nreflection are essential to ensure appropriate mastery of specified learning outcomes, and\nthese activities can be structured outside the virtual world. As not all gaming environ-\nments are collaborative in nature, it is important to consider how communication with\nothers can be built in to the learning package. Ways of doing this include face-to-face\ndiscussion interspersed with periods of individual game play, two individuals playing the\nsame game at the same time and discussing strategies, either face-to-face or using an\nonline messaging facility, or asynchronous message boards supporting game play and\nproblem-solving.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   225\nWhitton (2007) developed a set of practical criteria for the design of gaming worlds for\nlearning and teaching in higher education, from a constructivist viewpoint, focusing on high-\nlevel cognitive skills such as application, analysis and evaluation (Bloom 1956). Existing\ndesign guidelines in related areas were reviewed and synthesised and an evaluation of a\nnumber of popular Internet games with potential for learning was carried out to examine\ntheir design characteristics. These two pieces of work were drawn together to produce a set\nof six criteria for the effective pedagogic design of educational games for students in higher\neducation. \n(1) The environment should support active learning by encouraging exploration, prob-\nlem-solving, and enquiry, providing opportunities to test ideas and gain feedback,\npractice and consolidation. Opportunities for collaboration should also be provided\nand, as much as possible, game goals should align with learning outcomes. (This\nassumes, incorrectly, that collaborative learning is a prerequisite of \u2018all\u2019 learning;\nlearning by rote or didactic approaches can be effective in complex skill and\ncompetency development in higher education. Examples exist in the medical and\nengineering disciplines.)\n(2) The environment should engender engagement, with explicit and achievable goals,\nprovision of a large world to be explored with a high level of interactivities, multiple\npathways, and different ways in which success can be achieved. The world should\nstimulate the user\u2019s curiosity and provide an appropriate level of challenge and\ncontrol of the environment. This, however, assumes a level of competence of the\ncourse designer to develop \u2018engaging\u2019 immersive content and activities in the\ngaming medium, therefore a minimum requirement would be significant personal\ndevelopment planning for educators to support development of their gaming literacy\nor development competence.\n(3) The gaming world should be appropriate for the learning context, in that it fits with,\nor is at least relevant to, curriculum and assessment, is suitable for the subject area,\nmatches the time available, and is personally relevant to and acceptable by the\nstudents.\n(4) The environment or associated activities should support and provide opportunities\nfor reflection, allow students to debrief from the game and contextualise their learn-\ning, and highlight the process of learning. (This makes the assumption that reflection\nis a requirement of all higher education learning activities.)\n(5) The environment must provide an equitable experience for all users, taking into\naccount and accommodating differing prior knowledge and experience of that world\nand similar environments. Ideally it should allow for personalisation and customis-\nation and provide equal opportunities for all students to participate. Alternative\npedagogic approaches should be available to students aligned to their personal\nlearning preferences.\n(6) The gaming world needs to provide ongoing support, from initial orientation to early\ntasks that provide quick initial success, with a gradual introduction of increasing\ncomplexity, supported with help, hints or clues to ensure that the environment does\nnot become limiting. The gaming experience should aim to extend players to their\nextreme level of competence.\nWhile these guidelines were developed from a constructivist standpoint, it is recognised\nthat games can also be used effectively as instructional tools in adult learning contexts in\nfurther and higher education, adult and community learning, the corporate training sector\n226  N. Whitton and P. Hollins\nand in military applications. For example, the most widely accessed \u2018serious game\u2019 is the\nAmericas Army recruitment game with over 17 million downloads. In the game players are\ntaken through a simulation of army basic training, career selection and into combat teams,\nand US army research suggests that there has been a marked decrease in the military training\ndrop-out rates from those who have undertaken basic training in the Americas Army game\nprior to entry.\nIn this section some of the issues associated with the practicalities of using virtual\ngaming worlds to teach have been discussed. A range of options exist for creating different\ntypes of virtual gaming environments and these are explored in the following section.\n4. Selecting a virtual gaming environment\nA number of options of virtual gaming environments are available to the educator, from\nusing off-the-shelf games software designed for entertainment, to creating a bespoke\nenvironment from scratch.\nSome school-based practitioners use existing commercial games in a teaching context,\nfor example using the Civilization game to teach history (Squire 2005) and in the Teaching\nwith Games project undertaken by Futurelab and Electronic Arts (Sandford et al. 2006).\nThis has the advantage of enabling students to use a high-end product, which has been\nexplicitly designed to be engaging; however many commercial games are also expensive.\nGiven the established business model where publishers commission development studios to\ndevelop content and pay ongoing royalties on unit (boxed) sales, developers insist, under-\nstandably, on royalty payments being applied against a minimum retail price, leaving little\nflexibility in respect of pricing for educational use. The technical architecture of commercial\ngames makes the disaggregation of content almost impossible, an essential requirement if\ngames are to be used in the time-constrained classroom environment. It can be difficult to\nexactly match the outcomes of the curriculum with those of the game so wrap-around brief-\ning and debriefing activities are particularly important. Commercial gaming environments\nmay also have complex interfaces, extensive functionality and a long learning period, which\nmay detract from the intended learning outcomes. The long time taken to complete many\ngames may also be far greater than a typical teaching timetable, however even given these\nlimitations, innovative approaches to the use of games in the classroom have emerged, for\nexample the innovative use of the Myst adventure game in English Literature (Rylands\n2007).\nThe growing trend towards modifying existing games software for use in education (de\nFreitas 2007) may provide one way to address some of these issues. Many gaming environ-\nments now come with a creation engine that allows teachers, or students, to develop their\nown add-ons such as new storylines or game areas. This reduces development time and\nrequired expertise \u2013 but is still not a trivial process \u2013 and can help to ensure the links\nbetween learning and gaming outcomes.\nA proliferation of available middleware and gaming engines, developed by the industry\nin order to negate spiralling development costs, are available to educators at increasingly\naffordable costs. For example many of Criterion\u2019s middleware tools are available to educa-\ntors at no cost, and the Havoc gaming engine has been used in a number of educational\nprojects such as the Virtual Multi User Learning Environment (VMULE) project, initially\nundertaken by the University of Liverpool and further developed by Futurelab (see\nwww.futurelab.org.uk\/projects\/vmule). In parallel to this, open source tools and technolo-\ngies such as OpenSim and Croquet are available to educators, but do require a degree of\ntechnical competency.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   227\nAs well as the option of using entertainment games, there are also a number of commercial\ngaming environments specifically designed for learning. However, these can be expensive\nand difficult to customise. Examples exist where the game exactly matches the subject\narea and learning outcomes and is suitable for students of a specific demographic (e.g.\nWhitton and Hynes 2006), but these are limited.\nA growingly popular option is the use of existing virtual worlds such as Second Life (e.g.\nChildress and Braswell 2006) or MMORPGs for learning. These massive online worlds\nallow the interaction of thousands of players in real-time in virtual spaces; they can manip-\nulate objects, solve quests, create and join groups, or work with others. Some worlds also\nallow users to create their own spaces and objects. Issues with using these worlds include\nthe lack of privacy from other users who can wander into teaching spaces, the bad reputation\nthat has built up over certain types of behaviour in these environments (for example violence\nin MMORPGs and the overtly commercial nature and sexual behaviour in MUVEs), and the\nhigh-specification machines and internet connections required to effectively run these\napplications. Hollins and Robbins (in press) have identified what they term the educational\naffordances of MUVEs, namely: identity, space, activity, tools and community.\nAnother option is the creation of a bespoke game, such as the action-adventure game\ndeveloped to teach basic literacy skills to adults (Kambouri, Thomas, and Mellar 2006).\nThis enables a designed match of learning outcomes with gaming outcomes for a specific\nuser group. However, the problems associated with the design of bespoke education soft-\nware involve the limited budgets compared to entertainment software, and how this affects\nthe expectations of learners. Jenkins (2002) argues that most educational software is of poor\nquality, badly edited and unprofessional. It is unlikely, however, that the amounts of money\nspent on commercial software will be viable in education, and it is important that resources\nare focused on ensuring that educational games for adults are well designed in terms of\nplayability and learning.\nAs well as viewing students as players of games (or merely consumers of content), they\ncan learn by developing or creating games. Rieber et al. (1998) argues that learning by\nbuilding games can be an at least, if not more, effective way to learn than traditional meth-\nods, while Gee (2003) argues that active, critical learning should lead to learners becoming\ndesigners, either by physically designing extensions to the game or by cognitively extending\nthe game design and using that to inform their play.\nA solution to the problem of finding a gaming environment that is fit-for-purpose,\ncustomisable and relatively inexpensive could be the alternate reality game (ARG). An\nalternate reality game is a type of interactive fiction that unfolds over a period of time, and\nrequires puzzles to be undertaken collaboratively in order to progress the story. An ARG\nconsists of three elements: a series of challenges, an underlying narrative, and a collabora-\ntive community, and while all three elements can be facilitated online, many challenges\ntake place in the real world, and may be collaborative or individual. ARGs have been\ntypically used for marketing and publicity (e.g. see Rose 2007) but also have potential in\neducation for providing purposeful and motivating collaborative activities to contextualise\nlearning.\nAlternate reality games have a number of advantages over commercial games or\ndeveloping fully online games from scratch. They are lo-fidelity, combining a range of web\ntechnologies so, while they do require some expertise and creativity to design, they are far\ncheaper and faster to create than developing high-end software, and can ensure that specific\nlearning outcomes are met. As they involve the integration of web technologies such as\nblogs, wikis, and social networking software, they provide users with the experience of\ndifferent technologies. Although ARGs do require ongoing monitoring and moderating of\n228  N. Whitton and P. Hollins\nthe community, this task is often undertaken by enthusiastic \u2018expert\u2019 players who can also\nget involved with building and extending the game.\nExamples of how ARGs can be used in education are provided in the Alternate Reality\nGames for Orientation, Socialisation and Induction (ARGOSI) project (see www.playthin-\nklearn.net\/argosi.htm) and the Futurelab Virtual Savanagh project (see www.futurelab.org.\nuk\/projects\/savannah).\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper has examined the use of collaborative virtual gaming worlds in the context of\nhigher education, looking at the pedagogic advantages, practical considerations and issues\nof selecting an appropriate environment.\nIn using these types of environment it is important to ensure that there is a sound\npedagogic rationale, which is clearly communicated, and they are not simply being adopted\nfor a perceived motivational effect. Creating effective educational gaming worlds can be\nexpensive, in terms of development time and expertise as well as financially, and it is essen-\ntial to ensure that there are actual benefits to their use. Creating \u2018good\u2019 games is extremely\nchallenging as an undertaking in itself; even the commercial sector struggles to achieve a\n20% success, using unit sales as the metric.\nThe future for virtual gaming in higher education may be twofold: first, where collabo-\nrative activities in the constructivist philosophy may be based around the use of environments\nwhere a low (financial) cost of entry exists, such as alternate reality games or Second Life;\nand second, for skills development in photo-realistic simulation activities \u2013 such as currently\nundertaken in the military and medical sectors \u2013 where development budgets have historically\nbeen significantly higher. Whether higher education practitioners will consider adopting\ncommercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products could be a subject of further research and analysis.\nThe novelty effect of using such environments should also be considered \u2013 both from\nthe perspective of teacher and student \u2013 as this may influence long-term acceptability and\neffectiveness. It is also crucial that these environments do not lead to unintended exclusion\nof some users, for example those individuals who find it difficult to navigate within three-\ndimensional spaces. Linking the use of these virtual worlds to appropriate and authentic\nassessment activities will also be one of the key challenges within the context of university\neducation. However, there are extremely active teaching and research communities emerg-\ning around the use of gaming environments, the Second Life Educational (SLED) commu-\nnity being a case in point.\nIn all, while there are, as highlighted in this paper, examples of the effective use of\nimmersive gaming environments in the context of adult learning in higher education, there\nis a clear need for more ongoing and robust studies into the potential of different types of\nvirtual worlds, studies that recognise the significant issue of the context of use. This will\nhelp to ensure that as innovative and effective practices emerge, they can be evaluated in\nthe context of the student learning experience and integrated into the growing body of\nknowledge on learning in virtual gaming worlds.\nReferences\nBeasley, N., and A.
