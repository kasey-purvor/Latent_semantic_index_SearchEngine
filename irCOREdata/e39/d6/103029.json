Most unexpectedly it is shown that the hole is localized towards\nthe top of the dot, above the electron, an alignment that is inverted relative to the predictions of all recent\ncalculations.

However, very little is known experimentally\nabout the nature of the QD carrier wave functions and their\nresponse to applied fields. Numerous calculations of the\nelectronic structure of QDs have been performed [2\u20135],\nbut in the absence of definitive structural information they\nassume idealized QD shapes, usually pyramidal [6]. How-\never there is evidence that in many cases the dots more\nclosely approximate to lens shaped [7], and may also con-\ntain significant concentrations of Ga [8], rather than be-\ning pure InAs. In view of the uncertainties in shape and\ncomposition, the applicability of the calculated electronic\nstructure to real dots must at best be regarded as approxi-\nmate at the present time.\nConsequently, experimental information on the nature\nof the wave functions is urgently required, to provide a\nreliable guide to theory, and a firm basis for the interpre-\ntation of experiments. In this paper we demonstrate that\nphotocurrent spectroscopy under electric field F provides\nimportant, new information on the carrier wave functions,\nand by comparison with theory, on the composition, shape\nand effective height of the dots. We show that the QDs pos-\nsess a permanent dipole moment, implying a finite spatial\nseparation of the electron and hole for F \u0001 0. Contrary to\nthe predictions of all recent calculations, we demonstrate\nthat the holes are localized above the electrons in the QDs.\nThis \u201cinverted\u201d alignment can only be explained by assum-\ning nonuniform Ga incorporation in the nominally InAs\nQDs. As a result of our work the extensive previous theo-\nretical modeling of the electronic structure of InAs QDs\nwill need to be reexamined.\nTwo types of dots were studied, both grown by\nmolecular-beam epitaxy on \u0001001\u0002 GaAs substrates at0031-9007\u000300\u000384(4)\u0003733(4)$15.00 \u00a9500 \u00b1C. The first type (samples A C) was deposited at\n0.01 monolayers per second (ML\u0003s) to give a density\n\u00041.5 3 109 cm22, base size 18 nm, and height 8.5 nm\n[Fig. 1(a)], as determined from transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM). The second type (sample D) had\na higher deposition rate of 0.4 ML\u0003s, resulting in a\ndensity \u00045 3 1010 cm22 and size 15 3 3.5 nm. The\nasymmetric shaped QDs, sitting on an \u00041 ML thick\nwetting layer, have their apex oriented along the growth\ndirection. Buried single dot layers were grown within the\nFIG. 1.

The buried dots studied in the\nphotocurrent experiments showed similar size and shape in TEM\nbut gave less clear images due to the presence of the GaAs\nmatrix.

Applying a\nreverse bias to a p-i-n structure (p region at surface) results\nin F pointing from substrate to surface [Fig. 1(b)]. For\nn-i-p the field direction is reversed. The total field is given\nby F \u0001 \u0001V 1 Vbi\u0002\u0003d, where V is the applied voltage\nand Vbi \u0004 1.5 V is the built-in voltage (d \u0001 0.3 mm for\nsamples A C and 0.5 mm for sampleD). Monochromated\nwhite light (\u00043 mW\u0003cm2, corresponding to extremely\nlow dot carrier occupancies) was used for excitation. The\nphotocurrent was measured with lock-in techniques, using\n400 mm diameter, annular contact mesas.\nPhotocurrent spectra, for unpolarized light incident on\nthe surface of the sample, as a function of reverse bias\nfrom 0 to 8 V (F from 50 to 320 kV\u0003cm), are shown in\nFigs. 2(a) and 2(b) for sample A (p-i-n) at temperatures\nT of 5 and 200 K, respectively. At 200 K, four well de-\nfined features are observed from 1.1 to 1.3 eV, arising from\ninterband transitions between the QD confined electron\nand hole levels. Similar spectra are seen at 5 K, though\nat low fields the interband transitions are quenched, and\na signal is observed only from the InAs wetting layer\n(1.41 eV) and the GaAs barriers (1.5 eV) [Fig. 2(a), in-\nset]. The temperature dependence arises from the change\nin the dominant carrier escape mechanism (carrier escape\nenables the photoexcited carriers to give rise to a photocur-\nrent) from tunneling at low T to thermal excitation at high\nT . With increasing field, at all T , all of the QD transi-\ntions shift strongly to lower energy [by 30 meV at 8 V\n\u0001\u0004300 kV\u0003cm\u0002], the signature of the quantum confined\nStark effect [9], but without any qualitative change in the\nform of the spectra.\nPhotocurrent spectra for light incident on a cleaved edge\nof a sample containing QDs grown under the same condi-\ntions as samples A, B, and C, but with the i region sur-\nrounded by AlGaAs cladding layers to provide in-plane\nlight guiding are presented in the inset to Fig. 2(b) [10].\nSpectra are shown for light polarized either in the growth\nplane \u0001Ek\u0002 or perpendicular to it \u0001E\u0001\u0002 [10]. The QD tran-\nsitions are seen to be strongly Ek polarized, demonstrating\nthat they have predominantly heavy-hole character [11].\nThe ground state transition energies at 200 K for\nsamples A D are plotted in Fig. 3(a) as a function of F,\ncalculated using Vbi \u0001 1.5 V. Positive field corresponds\nto reverse bias for p-i-n structures. We focus attention first\non samples B (p-i-n) and C (n-i-p) [12]. Their transition\nenergies exhibit a marked asymmetry about F \u0001 0, with\nthe maximum obtained for a nonzero field of290 kV\u0003cm.\nThis asymmetry implies that the QDs have a permanent\ndipole moment p. A nonzero Stark shift at F \u0001 0 of\nthe ground state transition has also been observed in\nthe photoluminescence (PL) of InAlAs-AlGaAs QDs\n[13] over the limited field range of 660 kV\u0003cm (PL is\nunavoidably quenched at higher fields).\nThe field dependence of the transition energies E in\nFig. 3(a) can be described to a very reasonable approxima-\n734FIG. 2.

The inset to (a) contains a photocurrent spectrum (V \u0001 0,\nT \u0001 5 K) showing the wetting layer and GaAs absorption. The\ninset to (b) shows QD spectra at 0 V (field 50 kV\u0003cm) for\nlight incident on the edge of low growth rate sample at 300 K,\npolarized either within \u0001Ek\u0002 or perpendicular to \u0001E\u0001\u0002 the growth\nplane. At high energy the spectra are unpolarized showing the\nabsence of any instrumental effects.\ntion by the expression E \u0001 E0 1 pF 1 bF2 [the solid\nlines in Fig. 3(a)], where E0 is the energy at F \u0001 0, the\nsecond term arises from the nonzero dipole moment p,\nand the third term arises from polarization of the dots in\nthe applied field (the quantum confined Stark effect). By\nfitting to the data for samples B and C, a value of p \u0001\n\u00017 6 2\u0002 3 10229 Cm is determined, corresponding to an\nelectron-hole separation of r \u0001 4 6 1 \u00c5 (from p \u0001 er).\nTheoretical modeling of self-assembled QDs predicts a\npermanent dipole moment due to their asymmetric shape\n[2]. However, the experimentally determined direction of\nthe dipole is very surprising. The maximum transition en-\nergy occurs for F in the direction from apex to base, cor-\nresponding to electron (hole) attraction to the apex (base)\nof the dots. This implies that the electron charge den-\nsity distribution lies below that of the hole at F \u0001 0, with\nthe dipole pointing from base to apex. This result is in\ncontrast to that predicted by all accurate modeling [2\u20135]\nof InAs QDs which predicts hole localization towards the\nbase of the dots, below the electrons. This calculated align-\nment occurs for pure InAs dots of any shape for which the\nVOLUME 84, NUMBER 4 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 24 JANUARY 2000FIG. 3.

[2\u20135]). It results from the strain-induced\nform of the valence band edge profile [3] (the strain acts\nto localize the holes in the widest region of the dots) and\nthe difference in the effective mass ratios along the growth\ndirection \u0001m\u0002hh \u00bf m\u0002e\u0002.\nTo determine dot structural parameters to reverse\nthe electron and hole alignment, and to fit the data of\nFig. 3(a), envelope function calculations, treating the\nelectrons and holes with separate one-band Hamiltoni-\nans, have been performed. The strain distribution for a\ngiven dot shape was calculated using a Green\u2019s function\ntechnique which provides an analytical expression in\nthe form of a Fourier series for the strain tensor [14].\nBand gaps and offsets were calculated using model solid\ntheory [15], including hydrostatic strain effects; the\nheavy-hole Hamiltonian included the spatial variation of\nthe biaxial strain deformation potential and the directionaldependence of the heavy-hole mass [as discussed earlier,\nthe edge photocurrent measurements in the Fig. 2(b) inset\ndemonstrate that the lowest transitions involve heavy-hole\nlevels, justifying an assumption of the theory]. Inverse\ncarrier masses, determined using three-band k ? p theory,\nand band offsets were assumed to vary linearly with\ncomposition.\nFor pure InAs pyramidal dots our calculations give good\nagreement with previous theories [2\u20135], with the hole\nwave function below that of the electron. We find reversal\nof this alignment is only possible if two conditions are ful-\nfilled. Firstly, the dots must have a graded In12xGaxAs\ncomposition, with x decreasing from base to apex (the\nholes tend to be localized in the region with the largest\nIn composition). Secondly, it is also necessary to severely\ntruncate the pyramid to achieve a dipole of the correct sign,\nsince strain localizes the hole strongly below the electron\nuntil the truncation factor is greater than \u00040.6 [16].\nThe best fit to the experimental data for samples B and\nC is shown as the dashed line in Fig. 3(a). This was\nobtained using a pyramid of base length w \u0001 15.5 nm,\nheight 22 nm, of which the top 75% is truncated [see\nFig. 1(b)] to give an actual height b of 5.5 nm, and x vary-\ning linearly from 0.5 at the base to zero at the top surface.\nThe quadratic component b of the energy shift is deter-\nmined principally by b, the dipole p by the grading and\nthe degree of truncation, and the absolute energy E0 mainly\nby b and w. In addition to fitting the data very well, we\nemphasize that the shape and size (b and w) employed rep-\nresent a good approximation to those obtained from struc-\ntural measurements [Fig. 1(a)]. Furthermore, any shape\nwider at the base than the apex (including full pyramids)\nof constant composition, or full pyramids with linear grad-\ning, never has a dipole of the correct sign. We thus obtain\nnew information by optical methods on the structure and\ncomposition of buried QDs which is very difficult to ob-\ntain from structural studies. Our conclusions regarding the\ncomposition of buried InAs dots are consistent with results\nof STM investigations on uncapped dots, which found evi-\ndence for Ga in-diffusion at the present growth temperature\n\u0001500 \u00b1C\u0002 [8], and for In segregation [17].\nData for devices A and D (slow and fast growth rates\nrespectively) in Fig. 3(a) also exhibit a maximum transi-\ntion energy for a negative field, showing that a permanent\ndipole with hole above electron is a general property of\nour QDs. Furthermore, the same sign of asymmetry of\nthe Stark effect has also been reported in AlInAs\u0003AlGaAs\nself-assembled QDs [13] supporting our findings. In addi-\ntion, we also note that the size of the quadratic component\nof the Stark shift for the slow growth rate samples \u0001A C\u0002\nis larger than that of the faster growth rate sample D, con-\nsistent with the smaller height of the dots in these samples.\nThe variation of the ground state photocurrent intensity\nwith field at 200 K is shown in Fig. 3(b) for samples B\nand C. It shows a qualitatively very similar variation to\nthat of the transition energies in Fig. 3(a). The marked\ndecrease with increasing positive field arises from the735\nVOLUME 84, NUMBER 4 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 24 JANUARY 2000FIG. 4. Transition energies as a function of field for sample A\nat temperatures from 5 to 240 K.\ndecrease in electron-hole overlap with F. It is notable that\nthe maximum photocurrent intensity for the n-i-p sample\noccurs at 2140 kV\u0003cm, in good agreement with the field\nof maximum transition energy in Fig. 3(a) where the elec-\ntron-hole overlap is expected to be greatest. The results\nare also reproduced very well by our calculations of the\ne-h overlap squared with field [the solid line in Fig. 3(b)]\nusing the same parameters as for the fits of Fig. 3(a), pro-\nviding further clear support for the overall model.\nIn Fig. 2(b), the energy separations and relative intensi-\nties of the transitions can be seen to be independent of field\n[18], in strong contrast to the behavior for quantum wells\n[9]. This behavior is consistent with the excited state split-\ntings arising from lateral quantization since, to first order,\nthe response to F along the growth direction z is deter-\nmined by quantization along z.\nThe data in Fig. 3(a) were obtained at 200 K. The varia-\ntion of the ground state peak position with F from 240\nto 5 K is plotted in Fig. 4. At low T , and F less than\n\u0004120 kV\u0003cm, there is increasing departure from the para-\nbolic behavior of Fig. 3(a). This deviation arises from se-\nlective tunneling from the inhomogeneous distribution of\ndot energies (at low T tunneling is the dominant carrier\nescape mechanism). At low F, only carriers excited in\nthe highest energy part of the distribution escape, and the\ntransition energy occurs above that expected by extrapola-\ntion from higher field. As F is increased, tunneling also\nbecomes possible from the lower energy parts of the distri-\nbution, until at 120 kV\u0003cm all carriers escape and the ob-\nserved energy corresponds to the mean of the distribution.\nWe are thus able to tune through the inhomogeneously\nbroadened dot distribution by varying applied bias.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that InAs-GaAs\nself-assembled quantum dots possess a permanent dipole736moment. The dipole moment is expected from the asym-\nmetric shape of the dots but its sign opposite to that pre-\ndicted by all recent calculations. In combination with\ntheoretical modeling we have deduced the effective height\nof the dots and the electron-hole vertical separation, and\nhave demonstrated that the nominally InAs dots contain\nsignificant concentrations of Ga. In light of these results,\nmuch previous theoretical modeling will need to be reex-\namined. We have also demonstrated that selective carrier\nescape from within the inhomogeneous distribution of dot\nenergies can be achieved.\nWe thank A. D.
