The main objectives of P3G are to\nencourage collaboration between researchers and biobankers, optimize study design, promote the harmonization\nof information use in biobanks, and facilitate transfer of knowledge between interested parties. The importance of\ncalibration and harmonisation of methods for environmental exposure assessment to allow pooling of data across\nstudies in the evaluation of gene-environment interactions has been recognised by P3G, which has set up a\nmethodological group on calibration with the aim of; 1) reviewing the published methodological literature on\nmeasurement error correction methods with assumptions and methods of implementation; 2) reviewing the\nevidence available from published nutritional epidemiological studies that have used a calibration approach; 3)\ndisseminating information in the form of a comparison chart on approaches to perform calibration studies and\nhow to obtain correction factors in order to support research groups collaborating within the P3G network that are\nunfamiliar with the methods employed; 4) with application to the field of nutritional epidemiology, including gene-\ndiet interactions, ultimately developing a inventory of the typical correction factors for various nutrients.\nMethods\/Design: Systematic review of (a) the methodological literature on methods to correct for measurement\nerror in epidemiological studies; and (b) studies that have been designed primarily to investigate the association\nbetween diet and disease and have also corrected for measurement error in dietary intake.\nDiscussion: The conduct of a systematic review of the methodological literature on calibration will facilitate the\nevaluation of methods to correct for measurement error and the design of calibration studies for the prospective\npooling of biobanks. This could increase the efficiency of the design of such studies, improve statistical power,\nreduce bias, and aid in the assessment of gene-environment interaction effects in complex diseases. The systematic\nreview of calibration of dietary intake information could inform gene-diet interaction investigations involving the\npooling of results from studies with nutritional data collected in different ways.\nBackground\nLarge prospective cohort studies that have collected\nDNA source material (such as blood, saliva or other\nbuccal specimens) with the aim of assessing both genetic\nand gene-environment (G \u00d7 E) interaction effects on\ncommon complex diseases are becoming more wide-\nspread [1,2]. It is well known that the statistical power\nwhen testing for interactions is much lower than that\nwhen testing for main effects and thus require very\nlarge sample sizes [3-5]. A further complication of the\nassessment of G \u00d7 E interactions is that they are usually\nsubject to measurement error, which further reduces the\nstatistical power to detect these types of interactions\nreliably. Errors in measurement of environmental expo-\nsure variables lead to biased estimates of effect sizes\n(e.g. relative risks or odd ratios). In the simplest case of\nmeasurement error in a single environmental exposure\nindependent of disease status, the bias will be conserva-\ntive [6]. If the environmental exposure measurement\n* Correspondence: derrick.bennett@ctsu.ox.ac.uk\n1Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU),\nUniversity of Oxford, Old Road Campus.

In more complex situations such as errors in\nconfounders or differential errors in an environmental\nexposure between diseased cases and healthy subjects,\nthe bias can operate positively or negatively [8]. The\nbias can also be in either direction when genotyping\nerrors are differential. When G and E are independent\nin the source population, and the errors in the assess-\nment of each are independent, both differential and\nnon-differential misclassification of a dichotomous\nfactor tends to underestimate departure from a multipli-\ncative G - E joint effect. The impact of misclassification\non departures from additive effects is difficult to predict\n[9,10].\nIn theory, case-control studies are more vulnerable to\ndifferential misclassification than are cohort studies (and\nthe related case-cohort and nested case-control designs).\nHowever, provided that the extent of misclassification of\nexposure does not vary by genotype, differential misclassi-\nfication between cases and controls may not be a serious\nproblem for the detection of departures from a multiplica-\ntive G - E joint effect [9]. Simulation analyses under more\ngeneral joint misclassification of genotype and environ-\nmental exposure, again focussing on detection of depar-\nture from multiplicative joint effects, also suggest that\nmany regular tests for the hypothesis of no interaction\nmaintain correct type I error rates in the presence of dif-\nferential misclassification when there is no effect or a\nweak marginal effect of genotype [11]. Regardless of this\nfact, however, there will still be a loss of statistical power\nhence the need for large sample sizes.\nIf it is possible to quantify the magnitude of the mea-\nsurement error, then making appropriate adjustments for\nit (i.e. calibration of the ensuing effect size), can add great\nvalue to the study of such environmental exposures, parti-\ncularly in terms of preventing a reduction in statistical\npower. Calibration studies that involve a subset of partici-\npants from the main study can be designed in parallel with\nthe main study in order to assess the degree of measure-\nment error in the environmental exposures of interest,\nand produce calibration\/correction coefficients [12-14]. In\norder to obtain sample sizes large enough to detect G \u00d7 E\ninteractions reliably, networks of researchers involved in\nsuch biobanks need to be formed in order to conduct col-\nlaborative projects across a variety of centres. This\nrequires harmonisation across the centres in terms of\nmethods used to measure exposure to a particular envir-\nonmental factor of interest, which often vary from centre\nto centre. However, if the relationships between methods,\nas well as their error structures, were known, this problem\ncould be addressed by use of correction and calibration\ncoefficients, which would allow harmonisation of the\nresults obtained from the different methods. Availability of\na \u201ccomparison chart\u201d of approaches to correct for mea-\nsurement accompanied by an inventory of correction\/cali-\nbration coefficients for methods used to measure an\nenvironmental exposure would represent a valuable\nresource for research on G \u00d7 E interactions.\nDietary intake is a particularly challenging environmen-\ntal exposure to measure, and studies of diet-disease asso-\nciations (and gene-diet interactions) are limited by the\ndifficulty in obtaining accurate estimates of long-term\nhabitual intake. In addition, the different strengths and\nweaknesses of the various dietary assessment methods\nresult in different degrees of accuracy in their estimates of\nhabitual intake, which further complicates the pooling of\ndata from multiple studies. Information from calibration\nstudies can be used to a) provide design information [e.g.\noptimal sample size needed]; b) assess the relationship\nbetween different dietary assessment methods; and c)\ndetermine the degree of measurement error in estimates\nof association between diet and disease [15].\nThe Public Population Project in Genomics (P3G) is an\norganisation that aims to promote collaboration between\nresearchers in the field of population-based genomics.\nThe main objectives of P3G are to cultivate collaboration,\noptimize study design, set-up and research activities of\npopulation-based biobanks, devise schemes to promote\nharmonisation of biobanks, and facilitate transfer of\nknowledge between group members and other interested\nparties. P3G currently describes over 150 biobanks\nthroughout its catalogues [16]. The importance of cali-\nbration and harmonisation of methods for environmental\nexposure assessment to allow pooling of data across stu-\ndies in the evaluation of G \u00d7 E interactions has been\nrecognised by P3G, which has set up a methodological\ngroup on calibration with the aim of: 1) reviewing the\npublished methodological literature on measurement\nerror correction methods with assumptions and methods\nof implementation; 2) reviewing the evidence available\nfrom published nutritional epidemiological studies that\nhave used calibration studies; 3) disseminating informa-\ntion in the form of a comparison chart on approaches to\nperform calibration studies and how to obtain correction\nfactors in order to support research groups collaborating\nwithin the P3G network that are unfamiliar with the\nmethods employed; 4) with application to the field of\nnutritional epidemiology, including gene-diet interac-\ntions, ultimately develop an inventory of the typical cor-\nrection factors for various nutrients. In this project, we\nwill systematically review the methodological literature\non measurement error correction methods and the nutri-\ntional epidemiological literature on calibration studies of\ndietary assessment, a field of central importance in the\nstudy of G \u00d7 E interactions and for which harmonisation\nis greatly needed.\nBennett et al.

Nutritional epidemiological studies\nwill be identified by a range of methods including com-\nputer-aided literature searches of medical databases\n[MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, CAB Abstracts\n(for Human Nutrition), Scopus, Dietary Assessment Cali-\nbration\/Validation Register, and LILACS]. We will also\nscrutinise the reference lists of study reports and review\narticles, and by inquiring among collaborators and collea-\ngues. Eligible studies identified subsequent to the pre-\nparation of this protocol will be reviewed and included if\nthey meet the eligibility criteria.\nData extraction\nBased on our search strategy a single reviewer will\nreview the titles, abstracts and keywords of every record\nretrieved. Full articles will be retrieved for further\nassessment on the eligibility of the study for inclusion in\nthe overview. Two reviewers will then independently\nselect the studies for inclusion in the review from the\nlist of potentially eligible studies. Details from eligible\nstudies (methodological and nutritional) will be\nextracted independently by two reviewers using a pre-\ndesigned data extraction form. The data extraction form\nwill include the following items:\nGeneral information (for both methodological and\nnutritional studies)\nName of study, country where study was conducted, year\nof publication, journal, language of publication, contact\naddress of corresponding author.\nMethodological information\nWas the method employed Bayesian or classical, can the\nmethod be implemented in standard statistical software\nor not, can the method deal with differential measure-\nment error or not, can the method deal with correlated\nerrors or not, can the method be used for continuous and\ncategorical exposures or only a one type of exposure, does\nthe method produce precise and valid estimates in a vari-\nety of settings (e.g. case-control or prospective cohort).\nDietary information\nInstruments for assessing dietary intake employed, refer-\nence instrument employed, was the dietary assessment\ninstrument self-administered (e.g. computer) or not, if not\nself-administered how was it administered (e.g. inter-\nviewer), the timing of the administration; has the instru-\nment been validated for the population it has been used\non.\nThe fundamental information relevant to each dietary\nassessment method is outlined in Table 1.\nCalibration information\nThe type of calibration study and the most relevant\ninformation to extract for each type of study is\ndescribed briefly, in Table 2.\nMeasurement error information\nHow measurement error was assessed, the assumptions of\nthe method used to assess measurement error, the size of\nthe correction factor obtained.\nWhere the data extracted differ between assessors, the\ndiscrepancy will be resolved by consensus and when\nnecessary, additional information will be sought from the\nauthors of the studies. Where differences in opinion still\nexist, a third party will be consulted.\nQuality Assessment\nThe general quality of the methods used to estimate diet-\nary intake will be assessed separately from the data\nextraction process using a series of questions devised by\na member of the research team with expertise in nutri-\ntion, which will draw on information of existing scoring\nsystems such as those described by Margetts et al.

Items of methodological quality will also be\nreported, including main study design details and the\ncalibration study details. In addition, the assumptions of\nthe methods used to correct for measurement error, and\ntheir relative advantages and limitations will be discussed.\nTimeframe for analyses\nThe aim of this review is to a) collate information on pos-\nsible methods to correct for measurement error and b)\npresent the magnitude of correction factors for different\nnutrients obtained from different study designs. The col-\nlection of correction factors for different nutrients can\nserve two purposes: 1) they can be used directly to cali-\nbrate results from different dietary assessment methods in\nmulti-centre investigations, whenever calibration studies\nare not performed; 2) they can be used as prior evidence\nin Bayesian analyses of calibration studies\nWe have identified studies, either completed or\nongoing, that are potentially eligible for inclusion in the\nboth parts of the review. Data extraction should be\ncompleted by the end of the second quarter of 2012 and\nthe preliminary analyses will be conducted in the third\nquarter of 2012.\nDiscussion\nAlthough it is not possible at this present stage to\nanticipate the methodological and nutritional results\nfrom this project we expect to have the following\nknowledge available by the final quarter of 2012:\n1. To be able to adequately describe robust metho-\ndological approaches to the design of a calibration\nstudy in order to account for the effects of measure-\nment error in a biobank\n2. To be able to make the details of the different\nmethodological approaches to correct for measure-\nment error more accessible to a non-statistical\naudience.\n3. Describe how to apply the correction factors to\nstudies that aim to assess the association between\ndiet and disease with data collected from multiple\nsites.\n4. Ultimately, develop an inventory of the typical\ncorrection factors for various nutrients that are con-\nsidered in individual epidemiological studies.\nTable 1 Information to be extracted for each dietary assessment method\nDietary assessment method Relevant information extracted\nFood frequency (FFQ) questionnaire \u2022 Number of food items\nNon-weighed diet diary \u2022 Number of days covered\nWeighed records \u2022 Number of days covered\n24 hour recall \u2022 Single or multiple recall\n\u2022 If multiple 24 hour recalls used what was the number of recalls?\n\u2022 Time interval between recalls\nBiochemical marker \u2022 Name of the biochemical marker?\nTable 2 Type of calibration study with typical design and information to be extracted\nType of\ncalibration study\nTypical design Relevant information to extract\nReliability study \u2022 Employs a comparison of several instruments to estimate dietary intake one of\nwhich may be a \u201cgold-standard\u201d\n\u2022 Uses a sub-sample of subjects from the main study or an external sample\n\u2022 Number of instruments used\n\u2022 Number of subjects\n\u2022 Were biochemical markers used?\n\u2022 Was the sub-sample from main study or an\nexternal sample?\nValidation study \u2022 Employs a \u201cgold-standard\u201d compared with another instrument used to\nestimate dietary intake\n\u2022 Uses a sub-sample of subjects from the main study or an external sample\n\u2022 Number of instruments used\n\u2022 Number of subjects\n\u2022 What was the \u201cgold-standard\u201d (biochemical\nmarker\/other instrument)?\n\u2022 Was the sub-sample from main study or an\nexternal sample?\nReproducibility\nstudy\n\u2022 Employs replicate measurements for an instrument used to estimate dietary\nintake\n\u2022 Uses a sub-sample of subjects from the main study or an external sample\n\u2022 Instrument used\n\u2022 Number of subjects\n\u2022 Number of repeat measures used,\n\u2022 Spacing of repeat measures,\n\u2022 Were biochemical markers used?\n\u2022 Was the sub-sample from main study or an\nexternal sample?\nBennett et al.
