Nowhere is this more evident than in the broad arena of \nteaching and learning, where empirical studies of the realities of how technological \ndevelopments in social software are impacting on pedagogic practices, educational social \nrelations and online\/offline interactions between educators and students remains a sparse, if \ngrowing, field of research (Selwyn 2007).  \n  \n Web 2.0 technologies involve increased information sharing and collaboration \nbetween users. The term includes social-networking sites, video sharing sites, wikis, blogs, \nand folksonomies (also known as collaborative tagging or social indexing) where users are \nincreasingly involved in creating web content as well as consuming it. Such Web 2.0 \napplications are becoming more and more embedded in the daily and mundane routines of \neveryday life, particularly for young people in many places and a variety of different social \nsettings (Hargittai 2007; Kim and Yun 2007; Lange 2007; Leander and McKim 2003; \nTufekci 2008). To date, research on social networking sites (SNS) has received most \nsustained interest (boyd 2007a; boyd and Ellison 2007; Thelwall 2008). In the field of \neducation, such interest has tended to revolve around students\u201f educational use of social \nnetworking sites (Ellison et al. 2007; Selwyn 2007), the use, perspectives and interactions \ninvolved in educators accessing social networking sites in their pedagogic practice (Hewitt \nand Forte 2006; Mason 2006; Mazer et al. 2007) and related issues of trust and privacy in the \nuse of these social networking sites for educational purposes (Acquisti and Gross 2006; boyd \n2007b; Dwyer et al. 2007; Griffith and Liyanage 2008; Mitrano 2006). This work has tended \nto focus on the higher education sector, in a range of different educational establishments, \nmostly located in Anglo-America. However, it is equally clear that there still remains a dearth \nof empirical data exploring how online social networks might be used to aid socialisation \nmore generally into higher educational establishments and culture, how such social \nnetworking sites are then used by students for support and socialisation purposes whilst at \n 4 \nUniversity and how these social networking sites might be used by higher educational \nestablishments to support this socialisation process in the future\nii\n.  \n \n \n This lack of research is perhaps surprising given a recent study by Ipsos Mori (2007) \non behalf of JISC suggests that well over 95 per cent of British undergraduate students are \nregularly using social networking sites. However, still little is known about how this \nphenomenon impacts on the student experience and, in particular, if and how it facilitates \nnew students\u201f social integration into University life. This project was therefore developed to \nfocus on: \n \n\uf0b7 how pre-registration engagement with a University Facebook network influenced new \nstudents\u201f post-registration social networks; \n\uf0b7 how Facebook was then used by first year undergraduate students for support and \nsocialisation purposes whilst at University;  \n\uf0b7 whether there is any role for social networking tools to be used by University support \nservices and academic departments to enhance the social and academic integration of \nstudents, from the student perspective.  \n \nResearch was conducted with first year undergraduates at a British University\niii\n using an \nonline survey. The focus was on Facebook as this is the social networking site that has \nbecome one of the most popular online destinations (Hargittai 2007), particularly for British \nstudents of higher education, acting both as an important social domain and a powerful \ncommunication tool in young people\u201fs lives (Pastore 2002 cited in Fox et al 2007, 540)iv. \n \nThe paper is divided into six sections. After this introduction which lays out the \nbackground to the study, section two summarises the methodology of the research project. \nSection three focuses on pre-registration use of Facebook while section four outlines the way \nin which Facebook has been used to aid social integration into University life. Section five \nfocuses on the role that Facebook might play for University support services and academic \ndepartments. Section six draws some conclusions. \n \n \n 5 \n \nMethodology \nIn December 2007 the Facebook network for the University in this study listed 10,000 \nmembers, comprising current and past students, and staff. This project involved research with \nfirst year campus-based undergraduate students studying for a first degree. An online survey \nof first year Facebook users at the University was conducted in order to explore how they \nused Facebook for social integration into University life and for academic purposes. This \npaper is based on the results of the online survey which was carried out over a six week \nperiod between April and June 2008. This time frame was selected as most online survey \nresponse rates fall off after the first two weeks (Madge and O\u201fConnor, 2002). Moreover, it \nwas felt that conducting the online survey in the summer term also meant that the students \nwould have had time to reflect on their transition to University life, integration into student \nculture and use (or not) of Facebook for learning, all key aspects of the research project.  \n \nThe sampling strategy involved a multi-modal approach: the online survey and project were \npublicised via the University Facebook network, halls of residence Facebook groups and the \nUniversity\u201fs weekly email bulletin to all staff and students. Students were also invited to \nparticipate via email messages from their departments and via face-to-face requests in \nlectures. A final reminder message\/invitation to participate was sent to all people in halls \n(who would mostly be first years) by the University Registrar. These mixed recruitment \nmethods elicited a total of 213 responses, equivalent to a response rate of 7 per cent of the \nfirst year full-time campus-based undergraduate population. This sample size is equivalent to \na confidence interval of +\/-6.5 per cent at the 95 per cent confidence level (ie. if the survey \nwas repeated 100 times, 95 out of 100 administrations would yield results within +\/- 6.5 per \ncent of the current results). Most respondents were home students (89 per cent compared to \n86 percent for first years at the University), female (67 per cent compared to 53 per cent for \nthe University as a whole) and the disciplinary background of the sample population broadly \nrepresented that of the University as a whole (for example, 20 per cent of the sample \npopulation were from the Science Faculty compared to 18 per cent from the University as a \nwhole; 28 per cent from the Social Science Faculty compared to 24 per cent from the \nUniversity and 19 per cent from the Arts Faculty compared to 24 percent from the University \na whole). Any results must be seen in the light of these mild biases towards home, female, \nsocial science students.\nv\n  \n \n 6 \nHowever, given the size of the University Facebook network, and given the broad replication \nof the University\u201fs disciplinary structure in the survey sample, we consider that the results of \nthis study are broadly generalisable to the first year undergraduate campus-based population \nat this specific University in 2008. Moreover, although the questionnaire was based on the \nquantitative tradition, there was ample opportunity for respondents to elaborate on any point \nmade, through the use of many open questions. These more detailed quotations are presented \nverbatim below, selected both for their \u201etypical\u201f nature and being illustrative of the point \nbeing made. Below, the three main research findings are presented and discussed; the first of \nthese is regarding pre-registration use of Facebook. \n \n \nPre-registration use of Facebook  \nWhilst several studies have illustrated the significance of Facebook for undergraduate \nstudents once they have joined the higher education sector (Ellison et al., 2007; Hargittai \n2007; Selwyn 2007), less is known about how prospective students use Facebook prior to \ncommencing University. Our survey revealed that more than half (54 per cent) had been \nmembers of Facebook at school or college prior to starting University, 25 percent had joined \nFacebook immediately before joining University while a further 13 per cent joined \nimmediately after starting University. Further exploration of these data revealed that many \nstudents specifically joined Facebook pre-registration as a means of making new face-to-face \nfriends at University, particularly with people in the same hall or on the same course, whilst \nalso using Facebook to keep touch with current friends and family from home. This double \nuse of Facebook (by those using it prior to starting university) to retain current friendships \nfrom home, and to make new ones at University, is highlighted by the quotes below in \nresponse to the question \u201ewhy did you originally join Facebook\u201fvi: \n \nTo meet people before coming to university and because most of my friends at home \nused it. \n \nBecause my friends all had it and one of them told me that it was a good way to meet \npeople going to the same uni as me. \n \nTo hopefully get into contact with people who were living in my building or were on \nmy course through facebook groups. I hoped that knowing these people before I got \nthere would give me a head start at uni. \n \n 7 \nTo keep in touch with friends and for a bit of fun. Also to see if I could find anyone \ngoing to Uni living in my halls. \n \nSo that I could keep in contact with the people from my secondary school and to share \nphotos with people. I then realised that I could talk to the people I would be meeting \nat university through the groups and networks on Facebook and so started to use it to \nsearch for people in my future halls of residence or course.  \n \n \nIn total, over half of the respondents (55 per cent) had used Facebook to make new \n\u201evirtual\u201f friends prior to starting University. The modal and median number of friends they \nhad made were five but there were a few exceptional cases where students claimed to have \nmade a large number of online friends (up to 260) prior to arrival. The results also suggested \nthat most students in our survey joined Facebook (not another SNS) because Facebook was \nassociated with University level education. This corresponds with the findings of boyd \n(2007c) who reported that Facebook\u201fs University origins attracted those school students \naspiring to go to University. Similarly, in our study, at school the teenagers had \npredominately used Beebo or Myspace accounts, while their move to University was \nassociated with Facebook emerging as the dominant social networking site. This process is \nagain illustrated by the quotes below: \n \nI heard it was the \u2018Uni thing\u2019.  \n \nI joined because all my older university friends had one and as it is primarily a \nnetworking group meant for university students, I decided that I wanted to be on it. \n \nBecause I know it was the main method of communication at university and it was a \ngood way to stay in touch with friends from home. \n \nHad previously used 'bebo' as a way of simply talking to my friends whilst apart \nwithout the need to both be at a computer at the same time with instant messagers. \nBut was drawn to facebook, when all my mates switched to that, and was encouraged \nby the photo tagging system and simplicity of the sites presentation. \n \nIt is clear therefore that Facebook was an important social tool used by the majority of \nthe respondents to aid their transition to University. The importance of making new online \nfriendships with people in the same hall, course or University is apparent- but so too is the \nimportance of Facebook for keeping in touch with already existing friends as older offline \nrelationships shift to the online domain. Thus a complex picture is emerging whereby many \nstudents are not simply transferring offline relationships to an online mode, or moving from \n 8 \nonline to offline relationships; rather many students are doing both simultaneously. This is \nsignificant in that much previous literature has tended to argue for either offline relationships \ndeveloping into online ones (Ellison et al. 2007; Lampe et al. 2006; Selwyn 2007) or for \nonline worlds to move offline (McMillan and Morrison 2006). By contrast, our research \nsuggests that online and offline worlds are clearly coexisting, but used in different ways for \ndeveloping and sustaining different types of relationships. For example, face-to-face \nfriendships from home have been developed and sustained through continued online \ninteractions, while newer online relationships have flourished at university and developed \ninto face-to-face in-depth relationships. This reiterative use of the virtual and place-based \nworlds is important in providing a flexible multimodal approach for young people traversing \ntheir new lives and identities as students.   \n \n \nSocial integration into University Life \nOnce at University, the students in our survey utilised Facebook to aid their settling-in \nprocess and at the time of the survey (April to June 2008) they had a mean average of 81 \nonline friends in the University Facebook network. However, as might be expected, the \nstandard deviation was extremely high (62) and this number of friends conformed to the \npower law distribution of Shirky (2008) \u2013 that there were a few students with a very large \nnumbers of friends in the University Facebook network and many with relatively few. In this \ncase, the modal number of friends within the University Facebook network was 30, whilst \nthere was one individual who had over 460 Facebook friends in the University network and a \nfurther eight with over 200. \n \nThus this Facebook network continued to support the students\u201f friendship formation during \ntheir first year of study (although it must be acknowledged that being friends on Facebook \ndid not automatically relate to being friends in 'real life'). A resounding 97 per cent of \nrespondents had more friends on Facebook at the time of the survey than they did before \nstarting University. Indeed, 75 per cent of students said they used Facebook more than they \ndid prior to starting University and 62 per cent of respondents considered that the way that \nthey used Facebook had changed since they came to University. These changes were \ncharacterised by three main features. Firstly, Facebook was used to keep in touch with old \nfriends and to chart the University experience to them through the posting of photographs, \ngroup chat for virtual friends etc; secondly, Facebook was used initially for planning social \n 9 \nevents, joining University groups and keeping up to date with what was happening socially \nwith peers currently at the University; and, finally, and most significantly, Facebook was \nused extensively to make social links with others at university, thus enriching their \nsocialisation process. Each of these points is charted below. \n \nKeeping in touch with old friends \nFirst, the respondents indicated that they used Facebook to keep in touch with friends from \nhome. This was an important use of Facebook and survey respondents indicated that 31 per \ncent kept in touch on a daily basis with friends from home (comparable to the 37 per cent that \nkept in touch with University friends on a daily basis). Through group conversations and \nposting of photographs to share experiences, many students utilised Facebook to maintain \npre-existing friendships and links with people from home, which, as Ellison et al. (2007) \nsuggest, may offset feelings of \u201efriendsickness\u201f as the students move to a new location. These \nlinks to \u201ehome\u201f were resoundingly to keep in touch with friends, not family, and in several \ninstances the fact that the students did not have to pay for their communication (in \ncomparison to texts or phone calls) was considered an advantage.  The quotes below illustrate \nthese points. \nI now use it to keep in contact with all of my friends from back home. Also its good to \nhave a group conversation and all the emails get saved so organising things with \nfriends is easier.  \n \nIt has only changed a little, but since coming to university I have used to site more to \nshare in other people's experiences I suppose, possibly due to being apart from people \nback at home, so that I don't feel left out. \n \nI now use it as a place to store photos, see events that will be happening and to keep \nup with friends that i dont get a chance to physically see that offten as they are at \nother universities etc.Its a cheaper way of communicating to people rather than \nphoning or texting. \n \nPreviously no more than occasional communication with rarely seen friends.  Now for \nsharing information, contacting a large number of people, and sharing recent \npersonal news with friends amongst other things. I keep in contact with people who \naren't local anymore. I use it much more, to contact international friends during the \nholidays. I can also contact friends from home, and see what they've been upto via \npictures. \n \n \n 10 \nPlanning social events \nSecondly, the use of Facebook had changed on actually arriving at University as it was used \nextensively in the early days for joining University groups, planning social events and \ncommunicating with new online friends at University. A key use of Facebook for respondents \nwas for finding out about, and arranging, social events. Indeed, 49 per cent used Facebook on \na weekly basis and 23 per cent on a daily basis, to find out about social events. The majority \nof the respondents said that they regularly checked the University groups and halls groups. \nInterestingly, while 31 per cent of respondents had used Facebook on a daily basis for \nchecking out the profile of someone they had met socially, only a small minority (10 per \ncent) had used it on a daily basis to check out the profile of someone they had seen but had \nnever met, while a tiny 0.5 per cent admitted to using it on a daily basis to find someone to \ndate. For internet savvy young people, in a new and challenging higher education \nenvironment, once at University Facebook was used cautiously to make social links with \npeople they had first met socially, which somewhat counters the popular perception of \nFacebook as a free-for-all online dating agency. The quotes below highlight the role of \nFacebook as \u201ean integral part of student life\u201f and its importance for organising social \nactivities.  \nI have logged on more often to see updates and search for uni friends. I think it is an \nintegral part of student life as mos students have a profile. Its also a good way of \nbreaking ice barriers and making friends during freshers, after a night out you always \nadd people you meet or they add you. \n \nI have joined university orientated groups and I get updates and invitations to events \nthat are taking place in and around the university. Many social events organised \nthrough Facebook, meeting people through Facebook, groups for organisational \npurpouses rather than simply fun. \n \nI use groups and events far more to organise social\/work activities and photos have \nbecome very important for my friends. I now use it a lot more for sharing \nphotographs, and making plans with people.  \n \nI know use it to keep up-to-date with current university affairs through the Events \nsection of the Facebook website, along with the many groups etc. which have been \ncreated for that purpose.  \n \n \n \n \n 11 \nMaking social links with others at university \nDespite this increasing, but small, educational role of Facebook, it is clear that the \nsocialisation element was the most significant feature of Facebook for new students. Overall, \n21 per cent of respondents felt Facebook had been very important in helping them to form \nfriendships at University and a further 52 percent said it had been important or quite \nimportant. Only 27 per cent of respondents felt that Facebook had not been important in \nhelping them to form friendships at University. Similarly, 43 per cent agreed and 13 per cent \nstrongly agreed with the statement \u201cFacebook has helped me settle into University\u201d. When \nthe students were further asked how important they felt Facebook had been in helping them \nintegrate into University life, 24 per cent said Facebook had been very important and 30 per \ncent important. Only 19 per cent felt that it was not important in aiding their integration into \nthe world of higher education. Facebook had clearly been important to some students in this \nsettling in process but less so for others. More work is needed to disaggregate which students \nhad found it particularly beneficial, and why (see Wellens et al, in progress).  \n \nIndeed, when presented with the statement \u201cWithout Facebook I would be lonely\u201d, \nonly 3 per cent of respondents strongly agreed, 16 per cent agreed, 17 per cent neither agreed \nnor disagreed, 35 per cent disagreed and 29 per cent strongly disagreed. Facebook is thus \nclearly only one component in helping some students settle into University and in the opinion \nof many students, it was not crucial in overcoming loneliness, suggesting the continued \nimportance of face-to-face relationships when making the transition to University. One \nfeature of note is that students\u201f use of Facebook seems to be maturing through their first year. \nAt first it was used for finding out about social events and activities, but as year progressed, it \nappeared to be increasingly used to develop more meaningful and intense online relationships \nand more mature forms of communication, thus becoming an integral part of University life \nand a student\u201fs daily routine.   \nBefore Facebook was more about looking at other peoples profile and adding as \nmany people to your profile so that it seems that you have loads of friends but now its \nmore about just adding good friends and not just any random person that you \nhappened to meet on the train! \n \nBefore it was about finding new friends, however now it's more about keeping in \ncontact with my friends at uni and especially back in my home town. \n \n 12 \nI use it much more than I did before, to communicate with friends for many different \nreasons. Previously I was only using it for fun, but now I also use it to get in touch \nwith people and to arrange to meet people \n \nI now talk to all of my friends who are at university here or in other places and talk \nabout uni life in general whereas before I used it to search for people who were going \nto be on my course, in my accommodation etc. \n \nIndeed, 84 per cent of students agreed or strongly agreed that \u201cFacebook is part of my \neveryday activity\/routine\u201d, with 61 per cent agreeing or strongly agreeing that they felt \u201cout \nof touch\u201d when they had not logged onto Facebook for a while. When presented with the \nstatement \u201cI feel that I am part of the Facebook community\u201d 68 per cent agreed or strongly \nagreed. These results again support the suggestion that whilst Facebook is only one \ncomponent of social life at University, it remains an important one. \n \nAs Selwyn (2007) has highlighted \u201eStudents often use Facebook in the \nmicromanagement of their social lives, as an arena for social exploration and to develop \nsocial networks with their peers at University and from previous institutions they have \nattended.\u201f Whist this was the case in our study too, Facebook was also very significant in \nmaintaining friendships from home and in making the transition to University. Facebook was \ncertainly an important part of the \u201esocial glue\u201f that helped students settle into University life, \nthat kept the student body together as a community and which aided communication \n(especially about social events) between the student body. However, care must be taken not \nto over-privilege Facebook: it is only one aspect of undergraduate students\u201f general social \nnetworking practices at University and clearly face-to-face relationships and interactions \nremain significant.  \n \n \nEducational potentials?  \nResearch has suggested that Facebook is a potentially useful tool for promoting effective \nacademic practice.  Mason (2006), for example, suggests its utility lies in its reflective \nqualities, its mechanisms of peer feedback and its collaborative models of learning while \nSelywn (2007) notes its attractiveness lies in its ease of educated related interactions between \nstudents, albeit often in an informal way. In our research a clear picture emerged whereby \nfirst year undergraduate students generally thought the use of Facebook was most importantly \n 13 \nfor social purposes, secondarily for informal learning purposes (i.e. for student-to-student \ninteractions about academic work-related matters) but definitely not for formal teaching \npurposes (i.e. between staff and student and involving formal assessment).  \nInformal teaching purposes \nAs the academic year progressed, some students (albeit the minority) extended their use of \nFacebook from its purely social origins, to increasingly use Facebook for educational \npurposes. However, this still remained a minority use: only 10 per cent of respondents used \nFacebook for discussing academic work with other students on a daily basis and less (1 per \ncent) to contact University staff, in comparison to 23 per cent using it on a daily basis to find \nout about social events. However, as the students became more embedded in university life, \nFacebook was increasingly used by some students in an informal way for contacting other \nstudents to organise group meetings for project work, for revision and for coursework \nqueries: it became more than just a social network for some students but started to show signs \nof its informal educational networking potential.   \nWhen I first joined university, I used facebook to make new friends. I now use it to \nkeep in contact with people when asking for assistance on work and revision. \n \nI sometimes use facebook to get in contact with people in my seminar groups \nregarding work etc. I can also plan social events with university friends. \n \nMessaging to arrange work with other students- not just social \n \nI have a  few contacts that are on my course and i can ask them questions about work \nrahter then just chatting. \n \nour group for a project communicated via facebook bacause we used that more often \nthan checking our email so could get messages to eachother faster.  \n \n \nThese quotes highlight the potential of Facebook to informally discuss academic \nwork. Indeed, in our research 46 per cent of respondents stated that they used Facebook to \ninformally discuss academic work with other students on a daily or weekly basis and 22 per \ncent on a monthly basis. Almost half of the students were therefore using Facebook for some \nsort of informal academic purpose every week (e.g for revision, arranging group or project \nwork, often initiated by students themselves and not part of a formal requirement of a \ncourse). By contrast, only 7 per cent reported that they had used Facebook as a formal part of \n 14 \ntheir learning experience. Indeed, when presented with the statement \u201cFacebook is helpful to \nmy academic life\u201d, only 22 per cent of respondents agreed while 29 per cent neither agreed \nnor disagreed, 32 per cent of respondents disagreed, and 18 per cent strongly disagreed. This \nprobably reflects the fact that students login to Facebook far more frequently for social rather \nthan academic purposes and see it predominately as a social tool, not an academic one. \nInterestingly, 25 per cent of respondents felt that their academic work was often or very often \naffected by the amount of time they spent on Facebook while only 17 per cent of respondents \nreported that their academic work was never adversely affected. So clearly from the student \nperspective, Facebook is only an important aspect of their formal academic experience in so \nmuch as it distracts them from their formal studies!  \n \nFacebook and formal teaching \nThere were several activities that the majority of students did not use Facebook for, such as \nchecking out the profile of a member of University staff (68 per cent said they had never \ndone this) or  communicating with University staff (91 per cent had never used Facebook for \nthis). Facebook is therefore currently used by students for communicating with other \nstudents, not with University staff, findings replicated by Hewitt and Forte (2006). Moreover, \nwhen respondents were asked if there were any ways they thought Facebook could be utilised \nto enhance teaching and learning at the University, 43 per cent responded negatively, \nexplaining that Facebook was a social networking site, not a tool for academic work. Some \nexamples of student responses about using Facebook for teaching purposes are provided \nbelow, which highlight the strength of feeling over this issue: \n \nNo: Facebook and education should be kept strictly separate. Facebook is a social \nnetworking site and the ultimate tool of procastination, and while the social side of \nuniversity is important and it can help build and sustain bonds between people, asking \npeople to go on it for educational purposes is essentially giving them a green light to \nNOT do work. Besides, there is already blackboard and the university email accounts \nas an online way for the university to keep in contact with students. \n \nNot really, people tend to come on Facebook to get away from work and that aspect \nof university life in my experience. Its more for socialising and talking to friends \nabout work than for actually doing work, so Id be very reluctant to use Facebook for \nthat purpose. \n \nI'm not sure how I would feel if I was to be in contact with the lecturers through \nFacebook. I find email more straight forward and 'formal' to an extent and so it \nmeans that the work side of my life is kept separate. Facebook is a kind of escape \nfrom work and so I feel it wise to keep the two apart. However, I do use it to keep in \n 15 \ncontact with people in presentation groups, for example, and so do feel that that part \nof it is very useful to me, especially during breaks from university. \n \nNo - It is used, by and large, as a distraction from the university workload. If the \nuniversity tried to access the students through Facebook, I feel many people would \nfind it distasteful as if the university were trying to encroach on or cripple our social \nlives. \n \nFacebook is a social activity, academic activities should remain away from social \nlives.  \n \n \nHowever, 53 per cent of respondents did reply more positively about the use of \nFacebook for formal teaching and learning purposes and they made a series of suggestions \nabout the ways in which Facebook could be used. These included providing social and peer-\nled academic support for students in departments, revision opportunities and using Facebook \nto inform students of changes to lecture times. Notably most of these suggestions were not to \ndo with the pedagogic aspects of teaching and learning but more to do departmental or \nmodule related administrative arrangements. Many of the functions suggested are already \navailable within the University\u201fs Virtual Learning Environment but there is perhaps merit in \nexploring the links and synergies between the two systems. However, it must be noted a few \nstudents did suggest that Facebook might be a means through which they could access staff \nfor queries about specific modules and courses, but the time implications for staff may well \npreclude this idea being workable in practice.  \n \nYou could post notices about the university on facebook as a lot of people i know \ncheck facebook more regularly than their university email accounts \nI think some module information such as cancellations of lectures, could be \ncommunicated over facebook groups as it is checked more than blackbord and \noutlook by most of my friends,have groups on facebookto support modules then \npeople can discuss the module on a wall between all students. \n \nMaybe set up a facebook group to help students with exams or revision, to see if \nanyone wants to study together or to get help, i know we have blackboard, but it \ndoesnt always work \n \nAll lectures and tutors have their own facebook which they check regularly allowing \nstudents to post any queries etc. in a less formal manner than emailing. \n \nEvery degree should have its own facebook group so people from the same course can \ncommunicate asking for advice and help in assignments etc would be bonus if lectures \ncould answer questions here too. \n \n 16 \nI think that if important points were put up on a specialised group on facebook, that \npeople would be more likely to look at them than at emails. Also, I think it is a good \nopportunity for setting up debates and student based question and answer sessions. \n \nIn addition, 41 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they would not \nlike tutors to contact them via Facebook for formal teaching purposes. When presented with \nthe broader statement \u201cIt is inappropriate for tutor\u201fs to use Facebook\u201d 20 per cent agreed, 30 \nper cent neither agreed or disagreed and 36 per cent disagreed. It appears therefore there are a \nrange of opinions regarding tutors using Facebook, but generally, students were not overly \nkeen on the idea. This supports the findings of Mazer et al. (2007, 13) who note that teachers \nusing Facebook to foster staff-student relationships should do so with caution, as from the \nstudent perspective it was important that staff should only self-disclose appropriate \ninformation. One detailed account of a more positive outlook on staff-student interaction is \nnoted below but this type of opinion was in the minority. The quote does, however, certainly \nsupport the case made again by Mazer et al. (2007) whereby students accessing the site of a \nteacher could be associated with higher levels of motivation, more affective learning and a \nmore positive class room climate.  \nI think the staff should have and encourage Facebook relationships with students, \nallowing students to see a more human and accessible side of their tutors. I think that all \nthis nonsense about extra-curricular friendships between students and staff being \ninappropriate is not only insulting and anachronistic but also incorrect. The university \nhas many immensely educated members of staff, but throughout my academic life, the \nteachers in whose classes I performed best were those with whom I had the best \nrelationships, irrespective of their level of knowledge. Teaching someone is in itself an \nintimate thing, and so too should be the relationship between teacher and pupil. \nFacebook facilitates light hearted banter and friendship, and I think this jesting, this \npersonal knowledge of each other makes for the best human communication and also the \nbest pedagogy. I realise that is something quite taboo, but as adults, I am confident that \nuniversity students can be trusted to have mature and appropriate relationships with the \nstaff in a way that builds trust and desire for approval, and thus improves efforts and \nperformance...and I'm not just talking about the students! \n \nFinally, the students were also asked whether they considered it appropriate for staff \nfrom the University to contact them via Facebook in the future for teaching, marketing, \npastoral or administrative purposes. In all cases the majority of students were opposed to the \nidea. The responses are summarised in Table 1 below. \n \n 17 \nTable 1. First year undergraduate student opinion regarding University administration \ncontacting them via Facebook  \n Yes (per cent)  \nAdministrative matters 33  \nTeaching matters  42  \nMarketing matters 46  \nPastoral or personal support matters 47  \n \nA clear picture is therefore emerging whereby the students thought the use of \nFacebook was most importantly for social reasons, not for formal teaching purposes. \nAlthough it was sometimes used informally for learning purposes by students, they were not \noverly keen on the idea of being contacted by their tutors via Facebook for formal teaching \npurposes. Just under half of the respondents considered it to be acceptable for University of \nstaff to be contacting them for teaching, marketing or pastoral matters but only one third were \nhappy to be contacted for administrative matters. Here the students appeared to draw a \ndistinction between the positive use of Facebook for departmental and module level \nadministrative arrangements (many of their suggestions for using Facebook related to notices, \ntimetabling and setting up discussion groups) and the more negative view with respect to \ncontact via Facebook for central University administrative matters.  \n \n \nConclusions \nAlthough the results are only specific to first year undergraduates at the specific UK \nUniversity in which we conducted our research, given recent research findings that over 95 \nper cent of British undergraduate students are regularly using social networking sites (Ipsos \nMori, 2007), it would be surprising if similar tends were not occurring at other Higher \nEducational Institutions in the UK. We can therefore conclude that:  \n \n\uf0b7 Facebook is an important social tool used by the majority of the respondents to aid their \nsettling in process at University; \n\uf0b7 Facebook is part of the \u201esocial glue\u201f that helps students settle into University life, that \nkeeps the student body together as a community and which aids in communication \n(especially about social events) between the student body. However, care must be taken \n 18 \nnot to over-privilege Facebook: it is only one aspect of students\u201f social networking \npractices and clearly face-to-face relationships and interactions remain significant;   \n\uf0b7 A clear picture is emerging whereby the students thought the use of Facebook was most \nimportantly for social reasons, not for formal teaching purposes. Time spent on Facebook \n(for social purposes) was sometimes to the detriment of that available for academic study.  \nWhilst Facebook was sometimes used informally for learning purposes by students, such \nas to collaborate on group projects, and some students thought it might be useful for \nmaking departmental level administrative arrangements, most were not overly keen on the \nidea of being contacted by their tutors via Facebook. \n \nWe therefore feel that it is important that the British higher education sector is aware \nof Facebook and recognises its potential and importance to students but we would \nrecommend caution about moving into a social networking space that students clearly feel is \n\u201etheirs\u201f for social rather than academic purposes. Aggressive marketing, teaching or pastoral \ninterventions are not to be recommended. We follow Selwyn\u201fs (2007, 21) exhortation to \n\u201eallow these practices to continued unabated and firmly \u201ebackstage\u201f. However, we equally \nsuggest that as Facebook appears to be such an important social tool used by new students to \naid their settling-in process, higher education institutions could sensibly and gently act as a \ncatalyst for this process for pre-registration students by promoting the existence of \naccommodation\/hall and departmental Facebook groups. However, it must be remembered \nthat face-to-face and \u201ereal\u201f friendships remain significant as well as virtual relations and \ninteractions and we reiterate that Facebook is just one tool that new students will use to social \nnetwork. So, following Hodgkinson\u201fs (2008) more critical appraisal of Facebook, making \nsuch technologies available to new students does not guarantee that every individual will \nactually become more socially connected. It is equally  accurate to observe that for many of \nthe current undergraduate generation, the boundaries between online and offsite worlds have \nbecome blurred and many students will utilise a myriad of combinations of different place-\nbased and online-networks to develop and sustain their settling in process and maintain and \ndevelop social networks. Finally, it is clear that Facebook provides an informal learning \nspace for some University students. On Facebook they may engage in a wide range of team \nworking, organisational and other activities which may have relevance to their employability \nskills. University staff may want to help students recognise the skills that they are developing \nas part of this informal learning.  \n 19 \n \nThese conclusions aside, there is clearly potential for further research which gives a \nmore disaggregated view of which students are using Facebook, how and why. The research \nto date has focused on Anglo-American undergraduate students who use Facebook, who \noften remain a homogenized student body in research findings. There are many axes of \ndifference that might affect the role, purpose and non-use of Facebook and other social \nnetworking sites, which require greater attention.  For example, does the use of Facebook \nvary with disciplinary background, social capital, ethnicity and access to computing facilities \nand how might these digital inequalities then impact on educational achievement and \ndevelopment of social networks in everyday lives?; How and why do postgraduate and \nmasters students use Facebook differently to undergraduates and what language, accessibility \nand cultural issues might be at play to explain these differences?; What social networking \nsites might international students be using and how (and why) might their use differ from \nhome students?; How does an individual student\u201fs use of Facebook change over time, \nsuggesting the need for more longitudinal studies?; How does the broader political economy \nproduce international (and national) variations in the use of Facebook compared to the \nAnglo-American focus of most research to date? These are all compelling questions that will \nrequire serious research attention in the immediate future to gain a more nuanced and broader \nspectrum of understanding on social networking sites and their role in higher education. As \nboyd and Ellison (2007, 14) suggest, \u201eVast and unchartered waters still remain to be \nexplored\u201f in research on social networking sites.  \n 20 \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was funded by University of Leicester Teaching Enhancement Forum (TEF) \nand the Registrar of the University of Leicester.

Although \noriginally a development geographer, in recent years her attention has turned to \ncybergeographies. Through her cybergeographies research she has particularly been interested \nin the development of internet mediated research, and has published widely on this topic. She \nenjoys working in an interdisciplinary team, especially for the affordances it offers for \ntranslating research into praxis. \n \nJulia Meek is an independent researcher and evaluation consultant. She has over ten years \nexperience supporting academics develop, integrate and evaluate the use of learning \ntechnology in their teaching. Her PhD research focused upon the design and development of \nthe \u201eEvaluation Lifecycle Toolkit\u201f, a practical resource for evaluation. Julia is interested in the \nemergence of social networking sites and how people use web 2.0 technologies socially and for \nteaching and learning.   \n \nJane Wellens is an Educational Developer at the University of Leicester and works with \nacademic staff to develop learning, teaching and research activities.  She has a particular \ninterest in exploring how new technologies are being used in higher education and the extent to \nwhich such developments are underpinned by pedagogy. \n \nTristram Hooley is Senior Programme Manager for Vitae an organisation which supports the \ncareer development of researchers.  Prior to this he has worked extensively in HE and related \nsectors as a trainer, learning technologist, researcher and materials developer.

However, broadly speaking, Web 2.0 is commonly considered to be \nmore interactive, collaborative, participative and more flexibly and publicly available than \nWeb 1.0 applications, although it has to be acknowledged that many of these features were \nalso available in some Web 1.0 applications.  \n \nii\n The research was initially conceived of as feeding directly in to the University\u201fs student \nexperience committee, to directly feed into praxis with the attempt to improve students' \nexperience of transition. \n \n \niii\n The University in this study is located in the Midlands region of the UK, with a yearly \nintake of about 3,000 campus-based undergraduate students.  \n \niv\n For an overview of Facebook see Ellison et al (2007) and for a more critical appraisal see \nHodgkinson (2008). \n \nv\n This mild bias might possibly reflect the fact that one of the authors was based in a social \nscience department and thus these students were more willing to participate. \n \n \n"}
