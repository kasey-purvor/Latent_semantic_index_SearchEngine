INTRODUCTION\nThanks to asymptotic freedom, fixed-order QCD perturbation theory can potentially provide\naccurate approximations to physical observables at suitably large energy scales, Q2. Such a per-\nturbative description necessarily breaks down below the Landau singularity at Q2 = \u039b2, and the\ninfrared behaviour unavoidably involves non-perturbative effects. In fact non-perturbative infor-\nmation is needed even to make sense of perturbation theory, since higher perturbative coefficients\nexhibit factorial growth, and the perturbation series is not convergent. Using a Borel integral to\nrepresent the resummed perturbation series, the Borel integral is ambiguous due to singularities\non the integration contour along the positive real semi-axis in the Borel plane, so-called infrared\n(IR) renormalons. These ambiguities are structurally the same as terms in the operator product\nexpansion (OPE) in powers of \u039b2\/Q2. OPE ambiguities and Borel representation ambiguities can\ncompensate each other, allowing the perturbative Borel and non-perturbative OPE components to\nbe separately well-defined once a regulation of the Borel integral, such as principal value (PV), has\nbeen chosen [1]. For Q2 < \u039b2, however, the Borel representation which is correlated with terms\nin the OPE breaks down. In a recent paper Ref.[2], which focussed on the infrared freezing of the\nMinkowskian Re+e\u2212 ratio, it was suggested that below Q\n2 = \u039b2 one should use a modified Borel\nrepresentation whose ambiguities come from singularities lying on the integration contour along\nthe negative real semi-axis, so-called ultraviolet (UV) renormalons. This Borel representation has\nambiguities which are structurally the same as a modified expansion in powers of Q2\/\u039b2, and once\nregulated both components can remain defined in the infrared. This change of Borel representa-\ntion has been claimed not to be physically motivated in Ref.[3], where different conclusions about\ninfrared behaviour are reached. In this paper we shall show that if we postulate a QCD skeleton\nexpansion [4, 5], then the leading one-chain term reproduces the standard Borel representation for\nQ2 > \u039b2, and the proposed modified Borel representation for Q2 < \u039b2.\nWe consider the infrared behaviour of the one-chain result for some Euclidean QCD observables.\nWe shall concentrate on the Adler-D function, the GLS sum rule and the polarised and unpolarised\nBjorken sum rules [6, 7]. The skeleton expansion result automatically freezes to zero as Q2 \u2192 0.\nFor the observables we consider, the freezing to zero occurs after the Borel resummed perturbative\ncorrections to the parton model result change sign in the vicinity ofQ2 = \u039b2. Individual renormalon\ncontributions to the Borel integral diverge at Q2 = \u039b2, but we find that when all of the renormalons\nare summed over, one obtains a finite result. This finiteness requires relations between the residues\nof infrared and ultraviolet renormalons. Only one of these relations has previously been noted\n[8], and we show that they arise from the continuity of the characteristic function in the skeleton\nexpansion. Considering the compensation of perturbative and OPE ambiguities alluded to above,\nwe are led to an expression for the Q2-dependence of the observable written in terms of the\ncharacteristic function, and containing a single undetermined non-perturbative parameter. This\n2\nresult freezes to zero in the infrared. Existing discussions of infrared freezing behaviour have largely\nfocused on the Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) approach [9]. In this formalism one expands\nobservables in a basis of functions which have smooth infrared behaviour. For Euclidean observables\nthe unphysical Landau singularity in the coupling is cancelled by a power-like correction. In\ncontrast in our discussion finiteness and continuity emerge thanks to a subtle interplay between\nUV and IR renormalons.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we shall introduce the QCD skeleton expansion,\nand show that the one-chain leading term is equivalent to the standard Borel representation for\nQ2 > \u039b2, and to the modified representation for Q2 < \u039b2. We discuss what can be learnt about\nthe infrared freezing of observables. In Section 3 we describe the Borel plane renormalon structure\nfor our chosen Euclidean observables, and we show that finiteness at Q2 = \u039b2 only holds if there\nare cancellations between the residues of IR and UV renormalons, the cancellations rely on a\npreviously unknown relation between the IR and UV residues. We write down a result for the\nQ2 dependence of the resummed observables in terms of Exponential Integral (Ei) functions, and\nplot the infrared freezing behaviour to zero noted above. In Section 4 we consider the skeleton\nexpansion for the Adler D function, and give an expression for the characteristic function of the\nleading one-chain term. Making a power series expansion, and changing variables, we explicitly\nobtain the Borel representations, and relate the IR and UV renormalon residues to the power\nseries coefficients of the characteristic function. Continuity of the characteristic function is shown\nto underwrite the relations between UV and IR renormalon residues noted above. In Section 5\nwe derive the result for Q2-dependence including non-perturbative effects mentioned above. In\nSection 6 we briefly consider Minkowskian observables, specifically Re+e\u2212 , and modify some of the\nconclusions of Ref.[2] in the light of the criticisms of Ref.[3]. Section 7 contains a discussion and\nour conclusions.\nII. QCD SKELETON EXPANSION AND BOREL REPRESENTATIONS\nConsider a generic Euclidean QCD observable D(Q2) having the perturbative expansion\nDPT (Q2) = a(Q2) +\n\u2211\nn>0\ndna\nn+1(Q2) . (1)\nHere a(Q2) \u2261 \u03b1s(Q2)\/pi is the renormalised coupling. Throughout this paper we will use the\none-loop approximation for the coupling,\na(Q2) =\n2\nb ln(Q2\/\u039b2)\n, (2)\nwhere b = (33 \u2212 2Nf )\/6 is the leading beta-function coefficient in SU(3) QCD with Nf active\nquark flavours. Q2 \u2261 \u2212q2 > 0 is the single spacelike energy scale. As Q2 \u2192\u221e asymptotic freedom\nensures that D(Q2)\u2192 0. Our interest is in the infrared limit Q2 \u2192 0, and the infrared behaviour\n3\nn321\nk k\nFIG. 1: A chain of fermion bubbles with momentum k running through them.\nof D(Q2). Specifically, is it possible that freezing to a finite infrared limit D(0) occurs? This is\nan intrinsically non-perturbative question which cannot be answered by perturbation theory alone.\nOne has in addition the non-perturbative contribution arising from the operator product expansion\n(OPE),\nDNP (Q2) =\n\u2211\nn\nCn\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)n\n. (3)\nThe freezing limit, if any, of D(Q2) = DPT (Q2) + DNP (Q2), depends on the behaviour of both\ncomponents as Q2 \u2192 0. Perturbative freezing will not arise from fixed-order perturbation theory,\none needs an all-orders resummation of Eq.(1). Unfortunately our exact information about the\nhigher-order coefficients is limited, at best, to calculations of d1 and d2, higher-orders are unknown.\nAll-orders information is only available in the large-Nf limit where one expands each dn as\ndn = d\n[n]\nn N\nn\nf + d\n[n\u22121]\nn N\nn\u22121\nf + . . . + d\n[0]\nn . (4)\nThe leading large-Nf coefficient d\n[n]\nn can be computed exactly to all-orders since it arises from a\nrestricted set of Feynman diagrams in which a chain of n fermion bubbles (shown in Fig. 1) is\ninserted in a basic skeleton diagram [10, 11]. In principle one can consider more than one chain\nand construct a QED skeleton expansion [12]. In QCD one can replace Nf by (33\/2 \u2212 3b) , and\nobtain an expansion in powers of b,\ndn = d\n(n)\nn b\nn + d(n\u22121)n b\nn\u22121 + . . . + d(0)n . (5)\nThe leading-b term d\n(L)\nn \u2261 d(n)n bn can then be used to approximate dn [8, 13, 14] and an all-orders\nresummation of these terms performed to obtain D(L)PT (Q2). Use of the one-loop form of the coupling\nin Eq.(2) ensures that this resummed result is RS-independent.\nThe leading term of the skeleton expansion arises from integrating over the momentum k flowing\nthrough the chain of bubbles [4, 5, 15].\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9(t)a(eCtQ2) . (6)\nHere t \u2261 k2\/Q2, and \u03c9(t) is the so-called characteristic function of the observable. The constant C\ndepends on the subtraction procedure used to renormalise the bubble. Standard MS subtraction\ncorresponds to C = \u22125\/3. \u00bfFrom now on we shall assume C = 0 which corresponds to the so-called\n4\nV -scheme, MS subtraction with renormalization scale \u00b52 = e\u22125\/3Q2. \u039b in Eq.(2) will refer to that\nin the V -scheme. The characteristic function satisfies the normalization condition\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9(t) = 1 , (7)\nwhich ensures the leading a(Q2) coefficient of unity assumed in Eq.(1). The form of \u03c9(t) changes\nat t = 1, and the range of integration splits into an IR and a UV part\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ndt \u03c9IR(t)a(tQ\n2) +\n\u222b \u221e\n1\ndt \u03c9UV (t)a(tQ\n2) , (8)\nthe IR part corresponding to k2 < Q2, and the UV part to k2 > Q2. By making a change of\nvariable one can transform the leading skeleton term into a Borel representation. For Q2 > \u039b2\none has the standard Borel representation (we shall explicitly write down the required changes of\nvariable in Sec. 4),\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndz e\u2212z\/a(Q\n2)B[D(L)PT ](z) . (9)\nHere B[D](z) is the Borel transform, defined by,\nB[D(L)PT ](z) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nznd\n(L)\nn\nn!\n. (10)\nB[D(L)PT ](z) contains singularities along the real z-axis. In the large-b approximation these are\nsingle and double poles at positions z = zn and z = \u2212zn, with zn \u2261 2n\/b, n = 1, 2, 3 . . .. The\nsingularities on the positive real semi-axis are referred to as infrared renormalons, IRn, and those\non the negative real semi-axis as ultraviolet renormalons, UV n. The IRn renormalons cause the\nBorel representation to be ambiguous since they lie on the integration contour along the positive\nreal z-axis. The difference between routing the contour above or below the singularity yields an\nambiguity\n\u2206D(L)PT \u223c\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)n\n, (11)\nwhich has the same form as a term in the OPE in Eq.(3), so that OPE ambiguities associated with\nthe (\u039b2\/Q2)\nn\nOPE term in DNP (Q2) can potentially cancel against the IRn renormalon ambiguity\nallowing each component separately to be well defined [1]. In practice we shall choose to take a\nPrincipal Value (PV) definition of the integral. The IR part of the t integration in Eq.(8) produces\nthe IR renormalon part of the Borel representation, and needs to be PV regulated. The second\nUV component produces the UV renormalons and does not require regulation. As we shall see in\nthe next section the standard Borel representation of Eq.(9) for Euclidean quantities diverges like\nln a(Q2) at Q2 = \u039b2 for each individual IRn or UV n renormalon contribution. When the full set is\nresummed, however, the ln a divergence is cancelled and a finite result is found. We shall explore\nthis further in Sections 3 and 4.\n5\nFor Q2 < \u039b2, a(Q2) < 0, and the representation of Eq.(9) is invalid. The key point is that the\nchange of variable from t to z is proportional to a(Q2), and so if a(Q2) changes sign the limits of\nintegration in z change sign, yielding the modified Borel representation\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u222b \u2212\u221e\n0\ndz e\u2212z\/a(Q\n2)B[D(L)PT ](z) . (12)\nThis is the modified Borel representation proposed in Ref.[2] where it was motivated as a stan-\ndard Borel representation corresponding to an expansion in |a(Q2)| = \u2212a(Q2), since by changing\nvariables one can write Eq.(12) as\nD(L)PT (Q2) = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndz e\u2212z\/|a(Q\n2)|B[D(L)PT ](\u2212z) . (13)\nSo we see that the one-chain skeleton contribution of Eq.(6) is equivalent to the standard Borel\nrepresentation of Eq.(9) for Q2 > \u039b2, and to the modified representation of Eq.(12) for Q2 < \u039b2.\nNote that when we substitute Eq. (10) into the Borel representation of Eq. (13), then it reproduces\nthe correct form of the perturbative expansion in Eq. (1), for negative a. The modified Borel\nrepresentation now has a contour of integration along the negative real semi-axis, and so it is\nrendered ambiguous by the ultraviolet UV n renormalon singularities. Correspondingly the IR\ncomponent of Eq.(8) is now well-defined and it is now the UV component which requires regulation.\nThe ambiguity from routing the contour is now\n\u2206D(L)PT (Q2) \u223c\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n)n\n. (14)\nIt was suggested in Ref.[2] that the usual OPE of Eq.(3) breaks down for Q2 < \u039b2, as does\nthe associated PT Borel representation of Eq.(9), and should be recast and replaced by a modified\nexpansion in powers of Q2\/\u039b2,\nDNP (Q2) =\n\u2211\nn\nC\u02dcn\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n)n\n. (15)\nThe nth term in this expansion has then structurally the same form as the ambiguity associated with\nthe UV n renormalon contribution. It was further suggested in Ref.[2] that a C\u02dc0 term independent\nof Q2 could arise from rearrangement of the standard OPE. This was motivated by a simple\ntoy example. In fact in the one-chain approximation no such term arises and both PT and NP\ncomponents freeze to zero. The terms in Eq.(15) are then in one-to-one correspondence with the\nUV n renormalon ambiguities. From its definition, the QCD skeleton expansion implies DPT (0) = 0\nin the Q2 \u2192 0 limit. For the one-chain term in Eq.(6) this simply follows because as Q2 \u2192 0 the\nintegrand vanishes everywhere in the range of integration, since a(tQ2)\u2192 0 for any given t. Higher\nmultiple chain terms will contain products of the form a(t1Q\n2)a(t2Q\n2) . . . in the integrand and will\nsimilarly vanish. This then implies that in the infrared limit DNP (Q2) behaves as\nDNP (Q2) \u2248 k\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n)n0\n, (16)\n6\nn21\nq q\nk\nn21\nq q\nk\n2\n1\nn\nqq k\nFIG. 2: Leading large-Nf contributions to the vacuum polarisation function at nth order in perturbation\ntheory.\nwhere UV n0 is the UV renormalon singularity nearest to the origin in the Borel plane. We should\nnote that the modified Borel representation, its infrared behaviour and its connection with UV\nrenormalons, has also been discussed in Ref.[16]. In Appendix B of that paper the infrared freezing\nof the Adler function D(Q2) was discussed and it was concluded that from general arguments of\nnon-perturbative spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the limit of a large number of colours,\nNc, one expected that as Q\n2 \u2192 0, D(Q2)\u2192 0 like\nD(Q2) \u223c Q\n2\nM2\n, (17)\nwhere M is the mass of a one-meson state, these states remaining massive in the chiral limit. A\nsimilar result is obtained in Ref.[17]. Since UV 1 is the singularity nearest the origin for the Adler\nfunction, n0 = 1, and the freezing expectation is indeed consistent with Eq.(16). Notice that\nstrictly the leading behaviour as Q2 \u2192 0 is the logarithmic freezing to zero of a(Q2) contributed by\nthe PT component. It is the non-perturbative effects which reflect the UV renormalon structure.\nIII. Q2-DEPENDENCE OF THE EUCLIDEAN OBSERVABLES\nWe begin by defining the three Euclidean observables we shall consider. The QCD vacuum\npolarization function, \u03a0(Q2), is the correlator of two vector currents in the Euclidean region,\n(q\u00b5q\u03bd \u2212 g\u00b5\u03bdq2)\u03a0(Q2) = 16pi2i\n\u222b\nd4x eiq.x\u30080|T [j\u00b5(x)j\u03bd(0)]|0\u3009, (18)\nThe leading-Nf component of \u03a0(Q\n2) can be calculated from the diagrams in Fig. 2. The Adler\n7\nfunction, D(Q2), is then defined via the logarithmic derivative of \u03a0(Q2)\nD(Q2) = \u22123\n4\nQ2\nd\ndQ2\n\u03a0(Q2).

Here\nD(Q2) = DPT (Q2) + DNP (Q2), with the two components defined as in Eqs. (1) and (3).

(22)\nK(Q2) being the QCD corrections to the parton model result, again split into PT and NP compo-\nnents as for D(Q2). We have neglected contributions due to \u201clight-by-light\u201d diagrams \u2013 which when\nomitted render the perturbative corrections to KGLS and KpBj identical.

(23)\nThe QCD corrections to the parton model result are again split into PT and NP components.\nThe leading-Nf contributions to these three sum rules can be calculated from the diagrams in\nFig. 3. These large-Nf results can be used to compute leading-b all-orders resummations for these\nobservables, D(L)PT (Q2), K(L)PT (Q2) and U (L)PT (Q2), as described in Section 2.\nThe Borel transform of D(L)PT (Q2) is well-known and can be found in Ref.[8],\nB[D(L)PT ](z) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nA0(n)\u2212A1(n)zn(\n1 + zzn\n)2 + A1(n)zn(\n1 + zzn\n)\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nB0(n) +B1(n)zn(\n1\u2212 zzn\n)2 \u2212 B1(n)zn(\n1\u2212 zzn\n) .

The purpose of the slight change\nof definition is to make more explicit the single and double pole structure. The Borel transforms\nof K(L)PT (Q2) and U (L)PT (Q2) can be found in Refs.[6, 7], respectively. They have a much simpler\nstructure than that of the Adler-D function since they arise from insertion of the chain of bubbles\ninto a tree-level diagram, rather than into a quark loop, as shown in Fig. 3. There are only a finite\nnumber of single poles and no double poles. Consequently we can write out their Borel transforms\nexplicitly\nB[K(L)PT ](z) =\n4\/9(\n1 + zz1\n) \u2212 1\/18(\n1 + zz2\n) + 8\/9(\n1\u2212 zz1\n) \u2212 5\/18(\n1\u2212 zz2\n) .

(27)\nAs noted in Refs.[7, 8] the leading-b approximations for the NLO and NNLO coefficients for these\nobservables are in reasonable agreement with the known exact coefficients.\nWe can now evaluate the Borel integral of Eq.(9) to obtain D(L)PT (Q2), K(L)PT (Q2) and U (L)PT (Q2).\nUsing the integrals\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndz\ne\u2212z\/a\n(1 + z\/zn)\n= \u2212znezn\/aEi(\u2212zn\/a) , (28)\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndz\ne\u2212z\/a\n(1 + z\/zn)2\n= zn\n[\n1 +\nzn\na\ne\u2212zn\/aEi(zn\/a)\n]\n, (29)\n9\nthe following resummed expressions are obtained,\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nzn\n{\nezn\/a(Q\n2)Ei\n(\n\u2212 zn\na(Q2)\n)[\nzn\na(Q2)\n(A0(n)\u2212 zlA1(n))\u2212 znA1(n)\n]\n+(A0(n)\u2212 znA1(n))\n}\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nzn\n{\ne\u2212zn\/a(Q\n2)Ei\n(\nzn\na(Q2)\n)[\nzn\na(Q2)\n(B0(n) + zlB1(n))\u2212 znB1(n)\n]\n\u2212 (B0(n) + znB1(n))\n}\n, (30)\nK(L)PT (Q2) =\n1\n9b\n[\n\u2212 8ez1\/a(Q2)Ei\n(\n\u2212 z1\na(Q2)\n)\n+ 2ez2\/a(Q\n2)Ei\n(\n\u2212 z2\na(Q2)\n)\n+16e\u2212z1\/a(Q\n2)Ei\n(\nz1\na(Q2)\n)\n\u2212 10e\u2212z2\/a(Q2)Ei\n(\nz2\na(Q2)\n)]\n, (31)\nU (L)PT (Q2) =\n1\n3b\n[\n8e\u2212z1\/a(Q\n2)Ei\n(\nz1\na(Q2)\n)\n\u2212 6e\u2212z2\/a(Q2)Ei\n(\nz2\na(Q2)\n)\n\u2212 2ez2\/a(Q2)Ei\n(\n\u2212 z2\na(Q2)\n)]\n.

It has the expansion\nEi(x) = ln |x|+ \u03b3E +O(x) , (34)\nfor small x, where \u03b3E = 0.57721 . . . is the Euler constant.\nA crucial point is that the above expressions for the Q2-dependence apply at all values of Q2.\nFor Q2 < \u039b2 the modified Borel representation, written as an ordinary Borel representation for an\nexpansion in powers of |a|, as in Eq.(13), corresponds to changing a(Q2)\u2192 \u2212a(Q2) , zn \u2192 \u2212zn, and\nadding an overall minus sign in Eqs.(30)-(32). One can easily see that these equations are invariant\nunder these changes. In Eq.(30) one needs to change A1 \u2192 \u2212A1 and B1 \u2192 \u2212B1, since they contain\na hidden zn factor in their definitions, also in Eqs.(31) and (32), the prefactor proportional to 1\/b\nalso needs to change sign since it has been factorised from z1, z2. The Ei(zn\/a(Q\n2)) functions\nexhibit a logarithmic divergence as their argument goes to zero, and so it would appear that one\n10\ndoes not obtain a finite result at Q2 = \u039b2. Using Eq.(34), one has,\nEi\n[\n2n\nba(Q2)\n]\n= Ei\n[\nn log(Q2\/\u039b2)\n]\n\u2243 Ei\n[\nn\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n\u2212 1\n)]\n\u2243 \u03b3E + ln\n[\nn\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n\u2212 1\n)]\n, (35)\nfor \u039b2 \u2248 Q2. Note that the only terms in Eqs.(30)-(32) which could possibly contribute to the\ndivergence are e\u00b1zn\/aEi(\u2213zn\/a) terms and, as can be seen from Eqs.(28) and (29), these are\ngenerated exclusively by the single pole terms in the Borel transform. The double pole terms only\ngenerate finite contributions at Q2 = \u039b2.\nUsing Eq.(35) we obtain the Q2 \u2192 \u039b2 limit of D(L)PT (Q2)\nD(L)PT (Q2) = \u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n[A1(n) +B1(n)] ln\n[\nn\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n\u2212 1\n)]\n(36)\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[z2n(1 + \u03b3E)(\u2212A1(n)\u2212B1(n)) + zn(A0(n)\u2212B0(n))] +O\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n\u2212 1\n)\n.\nSo the coefficient of the divergent log term in D(L)PT (Q2) is,\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n[A1(n) +B1(n)] , (37)\nand for K(L)PT (Q2) and U (L)PT (Q2) the equivalent coefficients are (\u22128+2+16\u221210 = 0) and (8\u22126\u22122 =\n0), respectively. Cancellation clearly occurs in the cases of K(L)PT (Q2) and U (L)PT (Q2) and in the case\nof D(L)PT (Q2) the previously unnoticed relation\nz2n+3B1(n+ 3) = \u2212z2nA1(n) , (38)\nensures that D(L)PT (\u039b2) is finite,\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n[A1(n) +B1(n)] = 0 . (39)\nA similar relation\nA0(n) = \u2212B0(n+ 2) , (40)\nwas noted in [8]. We shall show in the next section that the relations of Eqs.(38) and (40) are\nunderwritten by the continuity of the skeleton expansion characteristic function \u03c9\u03a0(t) and its first\nderivative at t = 1.

The expression can\nremain finite, however, if we sum the UV renormalons to finite n = N and the IR renormalons\nto n = N + 3. In this case the relation of Eq.(38) will ensure that the divergent terms cancel.\nWe took N = 50 and assumed Nf = 0 quark flavours, avoiding the need to match at quark\nflavour thresholds, since we are only interested here in the form of the freezing behaviour, not in a\nphenomenological analysis.\nThe plots in Fig. 4 demonstrate two important points about the Euclidean quantities we are\nconsidering. Firstly the finite behaviour at Q2 = \u039b2, and secondly that the Borel resummed\nperturbative corrections to the parton model result change sign just below or above this point.\nFor D these corrections become negative but crucially the full observable D(Q2) remains positive\nat all values of Q2. They then freeze to zero as noted in Sec. 2.\n12\nkq\nkq\nq k\nkq\nkq\nq k\nFIG. 5: Light-by-light scattering diagrams, used to calculate \u03c9\u03a0.\nThe relation of Eq.(38) simplifies the expression for the finite part of Eq.(36), it becomes\nD(L)PT (Q2 = \u039b2) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nzn[A0(n)\u2212B0(n)]\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n[A1(n) +B1(n)] lnn\n\u2248 0.123625 .

Although we have not given these\nvalues explicitly, they are of a much simpler form than in the case of D, and they can easily be\ndeduced by comparing Eqs.(26) and (27) with Eq.(24). From this we obtain,\nK(L)PT (Q2 = \u039b2) = \u2212\n8\n9b\nln 2 ,\nU (L)PT (Q2 = \u039b2) = \u2212\n8\n3b\nln 2 . (42)\nIV. SKELETON EXPANSION AND BOREL REPRESENTATIONS FOR THE ADLER\nFUNCTION\nWe begin with the one-chain skeleton expansion result for the vacuum polarization function\n\u03a0(Q2) defined in Eq.(18),\n\u03a0(Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9\u03a0(t)a(tQ\n2) , (43)\nwhere the characteristic function \u03c9\u03a0(t) is given by\n\u03c9\u03a0(t) = \u22124\n3\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nt\u039e(t) t \u2264 1 \u2194 IR\n1\nt \u039e\n(\n1\nt\n)\nt \u2265 1 \u2194 UV\n(44)\nIt can be obtained from the classic QED work of Ref.[21] by simply including appropriate colour\nfactors.1 In this language it is related to the Bethe-Salpeter kernel for the scattering of light-by-\nlight, and is the first term in a well-defined QED skeleton expansion [12]. The diagrams relevant to\n1 The origin of the minus sign in Eq.(44) is the difference between the definitions of \u03a0 given in Eq. (18) and Ref.[21].\n13\nthe kernel are shown in Fig. 5. It is easy to see how, by connecting the ends of the fermion bubble\nchain in Fig. 1 to the momentum k external propagators in Fig. 5, one can reproduce the topology\nof the diagrams in Fig. 2. The existence of the QCD skeleton expansion is more problematic [15].\n\u039e(t) is given by [21]\n\u039e(t) \u2261 4\n3t\n{\n1\u2212 ln t+\n(5\n2\n\u2212 3\n2\nln t\n)\nt+\n(1 + t)2\nt\n[L2(\u2212t) + ln t ln(1 + t)]\n}\n, (45)\nwhere L2(x) is the dilogarithmic function.\nL2(x) = \u2212\n\u222b x\n0\ndy\nln(1\u2212 y)\ny\n. (46)\nThough we define \u03c9\u03a0(t) separately in the IR and UV domains, the two regions are related by the\nconformal symmetry t\u2194 1t .\nThe Adler-D function, related to \u03a0(Q2) through Eq.(19), will have the one-chain skeleton\nexpansion term with characteristic function \u03c9D(t),\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9D(t)a(tQ\n2) . (47)\n\u03c9D(t) is obtained from \u03c9\u03a0(t) by performing the differentiation of Eq.(19) on Eq.(43) and then\nperforming integration by parts on the resulting expression.\nD(L)PT (Q2) = \u2212\n3\n4\nQ2\nd\ndQ2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9\u03a0(t)t\n(\na(tQ2)\nt\n)\n= +\n3\n2b\nQ2\nd\ndQ2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt\nd\ndt\n[\n\u03c9\u03a0(t)t\n]\nln[a(tQ2)]\n= \u22123\n4\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt\n[\n\u03c9\u03a0(t) + t\nd\ndt\n\u03c9\u03a0(t)\n]\na(tQ2) . (48)\nThe transformation from \u03a0 to D therefore induces a transformation in \u03c9\u03a0(t) of\n\u03a0(Q2) \u2192 Q2 d\ndQ2\n\u03a0(Q2) = \u22124\n3\nD(Q2)\n\u21d2 \u03c9\u03a0(t) \u2192 \u03c9\u03a0(t) + t d\ndt\n\u03c9\u03a0(t) = \u22124\n3\n\u03c9D(t) . (49)\nThis transformation spoils the conformal symmetry present in \u03c9\u03a0(t). Indeed the expressions for\n\u03c9D(t) in the UV and IR regions are slightly more complicated.\n\u03c9IRD (t) =\n8\n3\n{(\n7\n4\n\u2212 ln t\n)\nt+ (1 + t)\n[\nL2(\u2212t) + ln t ln(1 + t)\n]}\n(50)\n\u03c9UVD (t) =\n8\n3\n{\n1 + ln t+\n(\n3\n4\n+\n1\n2\nln t\n)\n1\nt\n+ (1 + t)\n[\nL2(\u2212t\u22121)\u2212 ln t ln(1 + t\u22121)\n]}\n(51)\n14\nHowever, a partial symmetry remains in \u03c9D(t) and this will be elucidated upon in the following\ndiscussion. We shall now convert the skeleton expansion form into the Borel representations of\nEqs.(9) and (12) by making a change of variables. To achieve this it is necessary to write \u03c9\u03a0(t) as\nan expansion in powers of t. This yields expressions in both the IR and UV regions comprising an\nexpansion plus an expansion times a logarithm.\n\u03c9IR\u03a0 (t) = \u2212\n4\n3\n(\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03bent\nn + ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6nt\nn\n)\n. (52)\nThe conformal symmetry expressed in Eq.(44) means that the UV part can also be written in terms\nof the coefficients \u03ben and \u03be\u02c6n\n\u03c9UV\u03a0 (t) = \u2212\n4\n3\n(\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u03bent\n\u2212n \u2212 ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6nt\n\u2212n\n)\n. (53)\nFrom Eq.(45), \u03ben and \u03be\u02c6n are found to be\n\u03ben>1 =\n4\n3\n(2\u2212 6n2)(\u22121)n\n(n\u2212 1)2n2(n+ 1)2 , \u03be\u02c6n>1 =\n4\n3\n2(\u22121)n\n(n\u2212 1)n(n+ 1)\n\u03be1 = 1 \u03be\u02c61 = 0 (54)\nPerforming the transformation in Eq.(49) allows us to write \u03c9D(t) as a similar expansion\n\u03c9IRD (t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[\u03ben(1 + n) + \u03be\u02c6n]t\nn + ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6n(n+ 1)t\nn (55)\n\u03c9UVD (t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[\u03ben(1\u2212 n)\u2212 \u03be\u02c6n]t\u2212n + ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6n(n\u2212 1)t\u2212n (56)\nUsing the expansions of Eqs.(55) and (56) we can now represent D(L)PT (Q2) in terms of a Borel\nintegral. We take D(L)PT (Q2) expressed in terms of \u03c9D(t) and then split the integral into IR and UV\nregions\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9D(t)a(tQ\n2)\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\na(Q2)\n\u222b 1\n0\ndt \u03c9IRD (t)\n(\n\u2212 ba(Q\n2)\n2\nln t\n)k\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\na(Q2)\n\u222b \u221e\n1\ndt \u03c9UVD (t)\n(\n\u2212 ba(Q\n2)\n2\nln t\n)k\n= a(Q2)\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n(\n\u2212 ba(Q\n2)\n2\n)k\n[\u222b 1\n0\ndt\n(\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[\u03ben(1 + n) + \u03be\u02c6n](t)\nn + ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6n(n+ 1)(t)\nn\n)\n(ln t)k\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n1\ndt\n(\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[\u03ben(1\u2212 n)\u2212 \u03be\u02c6n](t)\u2212n + ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6n(n\u2212 1)(t)\u2212n\n)\n(ln t)k\n]\n(57)\n15\nWhere we have used\na(xy) = a(y)\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n(\n\u2212 ba(y)\n2\nlnx\n)k\n. (58)\nWe note that [\u03ben(1 \u2212 n)\u2212 \u03be\u02c6n] = 0 for n = 1, which allows us to omit this term from the above\nsum. This expression may be transformed into a Borel integral of the form of Eq.(9) by changes\nof variables and integration by parts. We use the change of variables z = \u2212a(Q2)(n + 1) ln t and\nz = a(Q2)(n \u2212 1) ln t for IR and UV parts, respectively. Integration by parts is necessary for the\nintegrals with an extra ln t term. For Q2 > \u039b2, a(Q2) > 0, we then obtain the standard Borel\nrepresentation, of Eq.(9)\nD(L)PT (Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndz e\n\u2212z\na(Q2)\n[\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[\u03ben(1 + n) + \u03be\u02c6n]\nn+ 1\n1\n1\u2212 bz2(n+1)\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6n(n+ 1)\n(n+ 1)2\n1(\n1\u2212 bz2(n+1)\n)2\n]\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndz e\n\u2212z\na(Q2)\n[\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n[\u03ben(1\u2212 n)\u2212 \u03be\u02c6n]\nn\u2212 1\n1\n1 + bz2(n\u22121)\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n\u03be\u02c6n(n\u2212 1)\n(n\u2212 1)2\n1(\n1 + bz2(n\u22121)\n)2\n]\n,\n(59)\nand for Q2 < \u039b2, a(Q2) < 0, we obtain the modified Borel representation of Eq.(12), in which\nthe upper limit in z is \u2212\u221e. Having obtained the Borel transform we can now make contact with\nEq.(24) and this allows us to make the identifications\n\u03ben(1 + n) + \u03be\u02c6n\nn+ 1\n= \u2212B1(n+ 1)zn+1 n \u2265 1 (60)\n\u03ben(1\u2212 n)\u2212 \u03be\u02c6n\nn\u2212 1 = A1(n \u2212 1)zn\u22121 n \u2265 2 (61)\nfor the single pole residues and\n\u2212 \u03be\u02c6n(n+ 1)\n(n+ 1)2\n= B0(n+ 1) +B1(n+ 1)zn+1 n \u2265 2 (62)\n\u03be\u02c6n(n\u2212 1)\n(n\u2212 1)2 = A0(n\u2212 1)\u2212A1(n\u2212 1)zn\u22121 n \u2265 2 (63)\nfor the double pole residues. Substituting the form of \u03ben and \u03be\u02c6n given by Eq.(54), and comparison\nwith Eq.(25), verifies the above equations.\nEquations. (60) - (63) can be used to rewrite the \u03c9IRD (t) and \u03c9\nUV\nD expansions of Eqs.(55) and\n(56) in terms of the A0(n), A1(n), and B0(n), B1(n) renormalon residues. One finds\n\u03c9IRD (t) =\nb\n2\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2212z2n+1B1(n+ 1)tn \u2212 ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n(n+ 1)2[B0(n+ 1) + zn+1B1(n+ 1)]t\nn (64)\n\u03c9UVD (t) =\nb\n2\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n\u22121A1(n\u2212 1)t\u2212n + ln t\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\n(n\u2212 1)2[A0(n \u2212 1)\u2212 zn\u22121A1(n \u2212 1)]t\u2212n. (65)\n16\nThe discontinuity at t = 1 is then found to be\n\u03c9UVD (1) \u2212 \u03c9IRD (1) =\nb\n2\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n[A1(n) +B1(n)] , (66)\nwhich vanishes using Eq.(39). In the language of \u03ben and \u03be\u02c6n coefficients, Eq.(66) is equivalent to\n\u2212 2\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n(\nn\u03ben + \u03be\u02c6n\n)\n= 0 . (67)\nSo the relation between UV and IR renormalon residues of Eq.(38), which guarantees finiteness at\nQ2 = \u039b2, ensures that the characteristic function \u03c9D(t) is continuous at t = 1.\nFor the first derivative at t = 1 one finds the discontinuity\nd\u03c9IRD\ndt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nt=1\n\u2212 d\u03c9\nUV\nD\ndt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nt=1\n= b\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n[A1(n) +B1(n)]\n\u2212 b\n2\n4\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz2n[A0(n) +B0(n)] +\nb2\n2\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nz3n[A1(n)\u2212B1(n)] , (68)\nEquation. (39), which ensures that D(L)PT (\u039b2) is finite, means that the first line of this expression\nvanishes. The second line also vanishes, ensuring continuity of the first derivative of \u03c9D(t). This\nalso ensures that the D(L)\u2032PT (\u039b2) is finite (the prime denoting the first derivative d\/dlnQ). Indeed,\nthe required relation corresponding to the vanishing of the coefficient of the potentially divergent\nln a term in D(L)\u2032PT (\u039b2) is,\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[2z3n(A1(n)\u2212B1(n))\u2212 z2n(A0(n) +B0(n)] = 0 . (69)\nSo finiteness of the first derivative of D(L)(\u039b) at Q = \u039b, corresponds to continuity of the first\nderivative of \u03c9(t) at t = 1. Furthermore, Eq.(69) written in terms of \u03ben and \u03be\u02c6n is simply Eq.(67),\nwith an extra factor of \u22122. Consequently, the continuity of \u03c9D(t) and its first derivative stem for\na single relation, Eq. (67). The second and third derivatives are also continuous at t = 1, and their\ndiscontinuities involve additional new structures built from combinations of the A0,1 and B0,1. To\nensure finiteness of D(L)\u2032\u2032PT (Q2) at Q2 = \u039b2, one requires the relation\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[3z4n(A1(n) +B1(n))\u2212 2z3n(A0(n)\u2212B0(n))] = 0 . (70)\nFor finiteness of D(L)\u2032\u2032\u2032(Q2) at Q2 = \u039b2 one requires the relation\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[4z5n(A1(n)\u2212B1(n))\u2212 3z4n(A0(n) +B0(n))] = 0 . (71)\nEqs.(70) and (71) are also required in order for the second and third derivatives of \u03c9D(t) to be\ncontinuous at t = 1, furthermore, they can both be derived from the following relation\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n(\nn3\u03ben + 3n\n2\u03be\u02c6n\n)\n= 0 . (72)\nThe fourth and higher derivatives of \u03c9D(t) are discontinuous at t = 1 as noted in [4].\n17\nV. SKELETON EXPANSION AND THE NP COMPONENT\nIn this section we wish to consider more carefully the compensation of ambiguities between\nrenormalons and the OPE. The regular OPE is a sum over the contributions of condensates with\ndifferent mass dimensions. In the case of the Adler function the dimension four gluon condensate\nis the leading contribution,\nG0(a(Q\n2)) =\n1\nQ4\n\u30080|GG|0\u3009CGG(a(Q2)) , (73)\nwhere CGG(a(Q\n2)) is the Wilson coefficient. In general the nth term in the OPE expansion of\nEq.(3) will have the coefficient\nCn(a(Q2)) = Cn[a(Q2)]\u03b4n(1 +O(a)) . (74)\nThe exponent \u03b4n corresponding to the anomalous dimension of the condensate operator concerned.\nNon-logarithmic UV divergences [22] lead to an ambiguous imaginary part in the coefficient so that\nCn = C\n(R)\nn \u00b1 iC(I)n . If one considers an IRn renormalon singularity in the Borel plane to be of the\nform Kn\/(1 \u2212 z\/zn)\u03b3n then one finds an ambiguous imaginary part arising of the form\nIm[DPT ] = \u00b1Kn piz\n\u03b3n\nn\n\u0393(\u03b3n)\ne\u2212zn\/a(Q\n2)a1\u2212\u03b3n [1 +O(a)] . (75)\nHere the \u00b1 ambiguity comes from routing the contour above or below the real z-axis in the\nBorel plane. This is structurally the same as the ambiguous OPE term in Eq.(74), and if C\n(I)\nn =\nKnpiz\n\u03b3n\nn \/\u0393(\u03b3n) and \u03b4n = 1 \u2212 \u03b3n, then the PT Borel and NP OPE ambiguities can cancel against\neach other [23]. Taking a PV of the Borel integral corresponds to averaging over the \u00b1 possibilities.\nFor Q2 < \u039b2 the modified expansion of Eq.(15) will have an nth coefficient of the form\nC\u02dcn(a(Q2)) = C\u02dcn[a(Q2)]\u03b4\u02dcn(1 +O(a)) . (76)\nNow the exponent \u03b4\u02dcn is related to the anomalous dimension of dimension 6, four-fermion op-\nerators associated with UV renormalons [24], IR divergences associated with these render the\nimaginary part ambiguous, and C\u02dcn = C\u02dc\n(R)\nn \u00b1 C\u02dc(I)n . The modified Borel representation of Eq.(12)\nhas ambiguities arising from UV renormalons. Assuming that the UV n singularity is of the form\nK\u02dcn\/(1 + z\/zn)\n\u03b3\u02dcn one finds\nIm[DPT ] = \u00b1K\u02dcn piz\n\u03b3\u02dcn\nn\n\u0393(\u03b3\u02dcn)\nezn\/a(Q\n2)a1\u2212\u03b3\u02dcn [1 +O(a)] . (77)\nThis is structurally the same as the ambiguity in the modified NP expansion coefficient in Eq.(76),\nand if C\u02dc\n(I)\nn = K\u02dcnpiz\n\u03b3\u02dcn\nn \/\u0393(\u03b3\u02dcn) and \u03b4\u02dcn = 1\u2212 \u03b3\u02dcn, the ambiguities can be cancelled.\nIn the one-chain (leading-b) approximation the renormalons are single or double poles corre-\nsponding to \u03b3 = 1 or \u03b3 = 2, and correspondingly the ambiguous imaginary parts in Eqs.(75) and\n18\n(77) contain factors of a1\u2212\u03b3 which are 1 or 1\/a, respectively. For the Adler function Im[D(L)PT ] is\nobtained by making the change Ei \u2192 Ei \u00b1 ipi in the first line of Eq.(30) for Q2 > \u039b2, and in the\nsecond line for Q2 < \u039b2. For continuity of the Im part at Q2 = \u039b2 one needs to choose the sign of\nipi oppositely in the two regions. One then finds for Q2 > \u039b2\nIm[D(L)PT (Q2)] = \u00b1ipi\n[\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nB1(n+ 1)z\n2\nn+1\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)(n+1)\n\u2212 1\na(Q2)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\nz2n+1[B0(n + 1) + zn+1B1(n+ 1)]\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)n+1]\n. (78)\nCorrespondingly, for Q2 < \u039b2 one finds\nIm[D(L)PT (Q2)] = \u2213ipi\n[\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\nA1(n\u2212 1)z2n\u22121\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n)n\u22121\n\u2212 1\na(Q2)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=2\nz2n\u22121[A0(n\u2212 1)\u2212 zn\u22121A1(n\u2212 1)]\n(\nQ2\n\u039b2\n)n\u22121]\n. (79)\nComparing these expressions with Eqs.(64) and (65) one then finds that the imaginary part may\nbe written directly in terms of the characteristic function \u03c9D(t),\nIm[D(L)PT (Q2)] = \u00b1\n2pi\nb\n\u039b2\nQ2\n\u03c9IRD\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)\n(Q2 > \u039b2)\nIm[D(L)PT (Q2)] = \u00b1\n2pi\nb\n\u039b2\nQ2\n\u03c9UVD\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)\n(Q2 < \u039b2) (80)\nContinuity at Q2 = \u039b2 then follows from continuity of \u03c9(t) at t = 1. The C\n(R)\nn , and C\u02dc\n(R)\nn coefficients\nof the OPE and the modified NP expansion are in principle independent of the imaginary part,\nbut continuity at Q2 = \u039b2 is dependent upon relations between the A0,1 and B0,1 residues, such as\nEqs.(38) and (40), and the more complicated structures of Eqs.(69)-(71), needed for finiteness of\nthe Q2 derivatives. Although not strictly necessary for continuity, this continuity follows naturally\nif we write\nD(L)NP (Q2) =\n(\n\u03ba\u00b1 2pii\nb\n)\u222b \u039b2\/Q2\n0\ndt\n(\n\u03c9D(t) + t\nd\u03c9D(t)\ndt\n)\n. (81)\nHere \u03ba is an undetermined overall real, non-perturbative factor. The t integration here reproduces\nthe expressions of Eq.(80) in the two Q2 regions. If the PT component is PV regulated one averages\nover the \u00b1 possibilities, and combining Eq.(81) with Eq.(47) for D(L)PT (Q2) one can write down a\nresult for D(L)(Q2) for all values of Q2,\nD(L)(Q2) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt\n[\n\u03c9D(t)a(tQ\n2) + \u03ba\n(\n\u03c9D(t) + t\nd\u03c9D(t)\ndt\n)\n\u03b8(\u039b2 \u2212 tQ2)\n]\n. (82)\nThe Q2 evolution is fixed by the non-perturbative constant \u03ba, and by \u039b. The infrared limit is\nD(L)(0) = 0, we have already noted that D(L)PT (0) = 0, the NP component also freezes to zero since\n19\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nD(\nL\n)\n(Q\n2\n)\nQ2\/\u039b2\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nU(\nL\n)\n(Q\n2\n)\nQ2\/\u039b2\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nK(\nL\n)\n(Q\n2\n)\nQ2\/\u039b2\nFIG. 6: The bold curves corresponding to \u03ba = 0 are the perturbative corrections to the observables in\nEqs.(20)-(23), as in Fig. 4. The upper and lower curves correspond to the overall result including NP\ncontributions with the choice \u03ba = 1 and \u03ba = \u22121, respectively.\non integrating the second term one finds an IR limit of \u03c9IRD (1) \u2212 \u03c9UVD (1) = 0, from continuity of\nthe characteristic function at t = 1. The same expression holds for the other Euclidean observables\nK(L)PT (Q2) and U (L)PT (Q2) on replacing \u03c9D(t) by \u03c9K(t) and \u03c9U(t), respectively. We plot in Fig. 6\nthe overall result for D(L)(Q2), K(L)(Q2) and U (L)(Q2) for the choices \u03ba = 0, \u03ba = 1 and \u03ba = \u22121.\nFor the DIS sum rules \u03c9K(t), \u03c9U(t) and their first derivatives are continuous at t = 1. In the\ncase of U (L)NP (Q2) there are a total of three non-perturbative terms, and hence the continuity of\nthe characteristic function and its first derivative fixes the form of the function up to an overall\nconstant factor. Thus Eq. (82) does indeed hold for U (L)(Q2) without conjecturing the form of\nEq. (81).\nVI. INFRARED FREEZING BEHAVIOUR OF Re+e\u2212\nWe turn in this section to a consideration of freezing behaviour of the Minkowskian quantity\nRe+e\u2212 which was discussed in Ref.[2]. This treatment was criticised in Ref.[3], which argued that\n20\nin fact there is an unphysical divergence in the infrared limit. We wish to address these criticisms.\nRe+e\u2212(s) will be defined by Eq.(20) with the perturbative corrections D(Q2) replaced by R(s),\n\u221a\ns\nhere is the e+e\u2212 c.m. energy. R(s) is related to D(\u2212s) by analytical continuation from Euclidean\nto Minkowskian. One may write the dispersion relation\nR(s) = 1\n2pii\n\u222b \u2212s+i\u01eb\n\u2212s\u2212i\u01eb\ndt\nD(t)\nt\n. (83)\nIf D(t) is represented by a Borel representation as in Eq.(9) one arrives at\nR(L)PT (s) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndz e\u2212z\/a(s)\nsin(pibz\/2)\npibz\/2\nB[D(L)PT ](z) . (84)\nThere is now an extra oscillatory factor of sin(pibz\/2)\/(pibz\/2) arising from the analytical continu-\nation. In consequence each individual IR or UV renormalon contribution at Q2 = \u039b2 will be finite,\nand the cancellation of Eq.(39) is not required. One can also analytically continue the one-chain\nskeleton expansion result for D(L)PT (Q2) to obtain\nR(L)PT (s) =\n2\npib\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9D(t) arctan\n(\npiba(ts)\n2\n)\n. (85)\nHere the principal branch of arctan is assumed so it lies in the interval [\u2212pi\/2,+pi\/2], and\narctan(0) = 0. This form is equivalent to the Borel representation of Eq.(84) for s > \u039b2, and\nto the modified Borel representation for s < \u039b2. Notice that the choice of principal branch is\ncrucial if the PV Borel sum is to be continuous at s = \u039b2 . The result freezes to the IR limit\nR(L)PT (0) = 0, since arctan(0) = 0 on the principal branch. This freezing limit differs from that\nfound in the APT approach [9], where a freezing to an IR limit of 2\/b occurs. This freezing limit\nwas also erroneously claimed in Ref. [2], but then the PV Borel sum is discontinuous. In Ref.[3]\nunphysical singularities in the region \u2212\u039b2 < s < 0 lead to extra terms and they find\nR(L)PT (s) =\n2\npib\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt \u03c9D(t) arctan\n(\npiba(ts)\n2\n)\n+\n2\nb\n\u222b \u039b2\/s\n0\ndt \u03c9D(t) +\n2\nb\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u039b2\/s\ndt \u03c9IRD (t) . (86)\nThese extra terms may be treated as contributions to R(L)NP (Q2). The final term leads to an infrared\ndivergence as s\u2192 0, and has an expansion of the same form as the OPE. Notice, however, that the\nMinkowskian OPE for R(Q2) is pathological and contains delta-functions \u03b4(s) and their derivatives\n[25]. It is only when a smearing procedure in Q2 is used [26] that it makes sense. In contrast for\nEuclidean quantities the regular OPE is potentially well-defined, and no smearing is required.\nWe will now consider the evaluation of the PV Borel integral for R(L)PT , and correct the erroneous\nstatements made in Ref.[2] noted above. This can be expressed in terms of generalized exponential\nintegral functions Ei(n,w), defined for Re w > 0 by\nEi(n,w) =\n\u222b \u221e\n1\ndt\ne\u2212wt\ntn\n. (87)\n21\nOne also needs the integral \u222b \u221e\n0\ndz e\u2212z\/a\nsin(pibz\/2)\nz\n= arctan\n(\npiba\n2\n)\n. (88)\nHere the principal branch of the arctan is again assumed. Care needs to be taken when Re w < 0.\nWith the standard continuation one arrives at a function analytic everywhere in the cut complex\nw-plane, except at w = 0 , and with a branch cut running along the negative real semi-axis.\nExplicitly [27]\nEi(n,w) =\n(\u2212w)n\u22121\n(n\u2212 1)!\n[\n\u2212lnw \u2212 \u03b3E +\nn\u22121\u2211\nm=1\n1\nm\n]\n\u2212\n\u2211\nm=0\nm6=n\u22121\n(\u2212w)m\n(m\u2212 n+ 1)m! . (89)\nThe lnw contributes the branch cut along the negative real semi-axis. To obtain the PV of the\nBorel integral one needs to compensate for the discontinuity across the branch cut and make\nthe replacement Ei(n,w) \u2192 Ei(n,w) + ipisign(Im w). One then finds that the IR renormalon\ncontributions to R(L)PT (s) can be written in terms of the functions\n\u03c6\u2212(p, q) \u2261 e\u2212zq\/a(s)(\u22121)qIm[Ei(p,\u2212zq\/a(s)\u2212 ipibzq\/2)]\n\u2212 e\n\u2212zq\/a(s)(\u22121)qzp\u22121q\n(p \u2212 1)! piRe[((zq\/a(s)) + ipib\/2)\np\u22121] \u03b8(s\u2212 \u039b2) . (90)\nThe UV renormalon contributions can be written in terms of the functions\n\u03c6+(p, q) \u2261 ezq\/a(s)(\u22121)qIm[Ei(p, zq\/a(s) + ipibzq\/2)] .\n+\nezq\/a(s)(\u22121)qzp\u22121q\n(p\u2212 1)! piRe[((\u2212zq\/a(s))\u2212 ipib\/2)\np\u22121] \u03b8(\u039b2 \u2212 s) . (91)\nThe PV regulated R(L)PT (s) is then given for all values of s by\nR(L)PT (s) = R(L)PT (s)|UV +R(L)PT (s)|IR\n=\n2\npib\narctan\n(\npiba(s)\n2\n)\n+\n2\npib\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n(A0(j)\u03c6+(1, j) + (A0(j) \u2212A1(j)zj)\u03c6+(2, j))\n+\n2B0(2)\npib\n\u03c6\u2212(1, 2) +\n2\npib\n\u221e\u2211\nj=3\n(B0(j)\u03c6\u2212(1, j) + (B0(j) +B1(j)zj)\u03c6\u2212(2, j)) . (92)\nNote that the presence of the \u03b8-functions is crucial in Eqs.(90) and (91). The terms they multiply\nare the extra contributions necessary to obtain the PV when Re w < 0. For s > \u039b2 the second\ncontribution is required for the IR renormalon contribution, but for s < \u039b2 it must be switched off,\notherwise the Borel integral will not be correctly evaluated. With a(s) < 0 for s < \u039b2, Re w < 0\noccurs for the UV renormalon contributions and the extra term must be switched on to obtain a PV\nregulation of the UV component. Leaving out the \u03b8-function in Eq.(90) would cause an unphysical\ndivergence in the infrared, and leaving it out in Eq.(91) would cause asymptotic freedom to fail in\n22\nthe ultraviolet. If the PV is correctly evaluated with arctan remaining on the principal branch for\ns2 < \u039b2 then one obtains R(L)PT (0) = (2\/pib) arctan(0) = 0. Notice that at first sight the PV result\nappears to be discontinuous at s = \u039b2, as the \u03b8-function contributions switch over. However the\ndiscontinuity is given by the \u03c6\u00b1(1, j) terms, and one finds, upon summing them, a discontinuity\n2\nb\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\n[B0(j)(\u22121)j +A0(j)(\u22121)j ] = 2\nb\nB0(2) =\n2\nb\n. (93)\nHere the relation of Eq.(40) ensures pairwise cancellations of terms, and B0(2) = 1 is left over.\nIf we remain on the principal branch, however, the arctan term has an equal discontinuity of\nopposite sign, since (2\/pib) arctan(+\u221e) = 1\/b, whereas (2\/pib) arctan(\u2212\u221e) = \u22121\/b, and overall\nthere is continuity at s = \u039b2. In Ref.[2] it was wrongly claimed that the PV result is discontinuous\nat s = \u039b2, and instead it was suggested to use a regulation where one throws away the second\nterms in Eqs.(90) and (91). These terms are of the form (\u039b2\/s)\nq\n, and (s\/\u039b2)\nq\n, respectively, and\nso they can simply be absorbed into the regular OPE and its modified form.\nWe finally discuss the ambiguous Im[R(L)PT (s)]. This may be straightforwardly evaluated as\nIm[R(L)PT (s)] = \u00b1ipi\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[B0(n) +B1(n)zn]zn(\u22121)n\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)n\n(Q2 > \u039b2)\nIm[R(l)PT (s)] = \u2213ipi\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n[A0(n)\u2212A1(n)zn]zn(\u22121)n\n(\n\u039b2\nQ2\n)n\n(Q2 < \u039b2) . (94)\nIf one defines \u03c9D(t) \u2261 \u03c9(1)D (t)+ln t \u03c9(2)D (t), the split being into the single and double pole renormalon\ncontributions, then comparing with Eqs.(64) and (65) one finds\nIm[R(L)PT (s)] = \u00b1\n2pi\nb\n\u039b2\ns\n\u03c9\n(2)IR\nD\n(\u2212\u039b2\ns\n)\n(s > \u039b2)\nIm[R(L)PT (s)] = \u00b1\n2pi\nb\n\u039b2\ns\n\u03c9\n(2)UV\nD\n(\u2212\u039b2\ns\n)\n(s < \u039b2) . (95)\nNotice that only the double poles contribute since the sin(pibz\/2)\/(pibz\/2) analytical continuation\nterm in Eq. (83) contains zeros at z = \u00b1zn which nullify the single pole contributions. Whilst\nthe characteristic function \u03c9D(t) is continuous at t = 1, the \u03c9\n(2)\nD (t) function is discontinuous at\nt = \u22121. The discontinuity is \u00b12\/b and arises from the same sum in Eq.(93) which gives an apparent\ndiscontinuity in the PV R(L)PT (s) component, although in the PT case this is cancelled by the arctan\nterm. Thus defined in this way Im[R(L)PT (s)] is discontinuous at s = \u039b2. It would seem that the\nproper way to proceed is rather to use the dispersion relation of Eq.(83) to analytically continue\ninto the Minkowskian region the expression for D(L)Q2 arrived at in Eq.(82). Unfortunately the\none-chain skeleton expansion form for D(Q2) is hard to consistently analytically continue, which\nwas a key motivation for the alternative inverse Mellin representation introduced in Ref.[28]. We\nshall defer further discussion of the more subtle issue of Minkowskian freezing until a later work.\n23\nVII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown in this paper that in the approximation of the one-chain QCD skeleton\nexpansion (leading-b approximation), the perturbative corrections to the parton model result\nfor Euclidean observables undergo a smooth freezing to an infrared limit of zero. We explicitly\nstudied the Adler function, GLS sum rule and polarised and unpolarised Bjorken DIS sum rules as\nexplicit examples, and found that they changed sign in the vicinity of Q2 = \u039b2, and then froze to\nzero at Q2 = 0. Continuity and finiteness at Q2 = \u039b2 follow from continuity of the characteristic\nfunction \u03c9(t), and its derivatives at t = 1. The one-chain term is equivalent to the standard\nBorel representation of Eq.(9) for Q2 > \u039b2, and to the modified Borel representation of Eq.(12),\npreviously proposed in Ref.[2], for Q2 < \u039b2. For the Adler function we established a dictionary\nbetween the residues of the IR and UV renormalon singularities, and the series expansion\ncoefficients of \u03c9(t). Continuity of \u03c9D(t) and its first three derivatives at t = 1 implies relations\nbetween the residues of IR and UV renormalon singularities: Eqs.(38), (40), (69), (70) and (71).\nIR renormalons for Q2 > \u039b2 lie on the contour of integration in the Borel representation, and\nsimilarly UV renormalons lie on the contour of integration in the modified Borel representation for\nQ2 < \u039b2. In both cases these singularities lead to an ambiguous imaginary part in D(L)PT (Q2), which\ncan be cancelled against an ambiguous imaginary part in the coefficients of the non-perturbative\nterms, in the two Q2 regions. The ambiguous imaginary part may be written directly in terms\nof the characteristic function, as in Eq.(80), and is continuous at Q2 = \u039b2. If the real parts of\nthe condensates are to result in a D(L)NP (Q2) which is continuous at Q2 = \u039b2 this suggests that\none should write these in terms of the characteristic function as well, which led us to conjecture\nEq.(81) in which there is a real overall non-perturbative factor \u03ba which is undetermined and\nobservable-dependent. All of these properties and results hold in general for Euclidean observables\nfor which a one-chain result of the form of Eq.(6) can be written down. As pointed out in Ref.[4]\nthis is not possible for Minkowskian observables such as Re+e\u2212 , and in this case the question of\nfreezing is more delicate. There is no characteristic function \u03c9R(t) to underwrite the smooth\ntransition through s = \u039b2 from UV to IR. Indeed the Minkowskian gluon condensate OPE\ncontribution is proportional to \u03b4\n\u2032\n(s) [25] , so without a smearing procedure it will give an apparent\ninfrared divergence as s \u2192 0. We corrected some erroneous statements about the continuity of\nR(L)PT (s) at s = \u039b2 made in [2]. The issue of Minkowskian freezing is interesting and requires\nfurther investigation.\nAn interesting feature of the skeleton expansion representation of Eq.(6) concerns the definition\nof a(Q2) for Q2 < \u039b2. In this region the result of Eq.(2) is not in fact the solution of the\nRG equation, but is an analytical continuation of the Q2 > \u039b2 result. However notice that\nin evaluating D(L)PT (Q2) for Q2 > \u039b2 one is integrating over the region t < \u039b2\/Q2 where the\n24\nanalytically continued a(Q2) is required. Also notice that QED skeleton expansion results can be\nobtained simply by interchanging UV and IR renormalons, and the limits Q2 \u2192 \u221e and Q2 \u2192 0.\nThe implication is that QCD in the IR energy region is QED-like, and conversely that QED in the\nUV energy region beyond the Landau ghost is QCD-like. Our result of Eq.(82) is closely related\nto successful models for power corrections based on isolating the IR renormalon ambiguity, such as\n[29], and to the power correction model of [30, 31]. The latter postulates an infrared finite running\ncoupling, and uses a dispersive approach. The infrared limit of the coupling \u03b10 is a universal\nparameter in this picture, whereas \u03ba in our approach is expected to be observable-dependent. A\nmore sophisticated discussion of power corrections to DIS sum rules has recently appeared in [32].\nNotice that continuity at Q2 = \u039b2 is the key constraint leading us to suggest Eq.(81), which\nis arguably not a model for power corrections but the actual form of the NP component in the\none-chain (leading-b) approximation. In future work we intend to report on fits of \u03ba and \u039b to\nexperimental data on the Adler function (e.g., the analysis of [33]), and DIS sum rules. It would\nalso be interesting to compare our results for the Q2-dependence of the polarised and unpolarised\nBjorken sum rules in the light of the relations between them noted in Ref.[34]. Whilst the freezing\nis straightforward to analyse in the leading-b, one-chain approximation, it is much harder to analyse\nat the two-chain level, where the anomalous dimensions for the operators will enter. The IR\u2194UV\nconformal relations between renormalon residues and condensate coefficients would appear to be\nthe key ingredient in the freezing picture, and there is hope that they can continue to hold at higher\norders in the QCD skeleton expansion, if indeed such an expansion can be consistently formulated\n[15]. There is clearly much still to investigate.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Irinel Caprini, Jan Fischer, Andrei Kataev and Dimitri Shirkov for\nextremely useful discussions, which have helped us to improve on an earlier version of this paper.\nP.M.B. gratefully acknowledges the receipt of a PPARC UK studentship.\n[1] For a review, see M.
