INTRODUCTION\nThe description of van der Waals interactions is a major\nchallenge for density functional theory ~DFT! approxima-\ntions. Calculations using conventional exchange-correlation\nfunctionals have been performed for a range of systems, in-\ncluding rare gas dimers,1\u201310 C6H6 dimer,3,7,9,11 CH4 and\nC2H2 dimers,9,12 HeflCO2 ,13,14 N2 dimer,15 C6H6flX @X\n5O2 , N2 , CO ~Ref. 16!, Ne, Ar ~Ref. 3!#, and other non-\nbonded dimeric complexes.17 Common conclusions are\nreached. The local density approximation ~LDA! tends to\noverbind1,2,4,5,16 while the performance of generalized gradi-\nent approximation ~GGA! and hybrid functionals is sensitive\nto the choice of exchange approximation. Functionals based\non Becke 1988 exchange18 often predict a repulsive\ninteraction;1\u20133,5\u20139,11\u201313,15\u201317 those based on PW91 ~Ref. 19!\nor PBE ~Ref. 20! exchange do tend to bind, although quan-\ntitative accuracy is lacking.4\u20139,14\u201316 This sensitivity to the\nexchange functional has been attributed5,16 to the behavior of\nthe exchange enhancement factor at large reduced density\ngradient s; the Becke 1988 enhancement factor diverges,\nwhereas the PW91 and PBE factors are better behaved. In\nour preliminary studies, we obtained results consistent with\nthis assessment. The HCTH93 ~Ref. 21! exchange-\ncorrelation functional, whose exchange enhancement factor\nincreases rapidly with s , does not bind the helium dimer. The\n1\/4 functional,22 whose enhancement factor increases more\ngradually,23 does bind. For a recent review of van der Waals\nstudies using conventional functionals, see Ref. 24.\nA DFT calculation using an appropriately chosen con-\nventional functional can therefore provide a qualitative de-\nscription of van der Waals systems at intermediate separa-\ntions, where there is a non-negligible overlap between the\ninteracting fragments and the interaction energy is composed\nof several terms ~dispersion, exchange-dispersion, electro-\nstatic, exchange-repulsion, etc.!. At larger separations, how-\never, where overlap is negligible, the interaction energy is\ndominated by the long-range dispersion energy, arising from\ncorrelated interactions between electrons on the separate\nfragments. The local nature of conventional functionals\nmeans they are fundamentally unable to describe this feature,\nfailing to recover the leading 2C6R26 interaction energy.\nAlthough this term can be introduced in an empirical\nmanner,25 more advanced methods must be used to introduce\nit rigorously. These include long-range26\u201333 and\nseamless34\u201338 approaches; see Ref. 39 for an assessment of\nsome of these methods. Kohn\u2013Sham orbitals have also been\nused within symmetry-adapted perturbation theory.40,41\nIn this study we consider the long-range dispersion in-\nteraction in DFT from the viewpoint of the force on a\nnucleus, rather than from the usual viewpoint of the elec-\ntronic energy. Given that dispersion is a correlation effect,\nwe treat exchange exactly using the Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Kohn\u2013\nSham ~HFKS! formalism.42,43 The electronic energy is\nwritten\nEDFT5EHF@$w i%#1EC@r# , ~1!a!Fax: 0191 384 4737; Electronic mail: D.J.Tozer@Durham.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS VOLUME 117, NUMBER 24 22 DECEMBER 2002\n111130021-9606\/2002\/117(24)\/11113\/8\/$19.00 \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.65.

Other than vC(r), all the\nquantities in Eq. ~6! can be constructed from the solutions to\nEq. ~4!. Given that vC(r) is the only approximated term in\nEq. ~4!, it follows that the quality of this potential alone\ndetermines the quality of the force for a given basis set. In\nessence, EC@r# governs the accuracy of the total energy, so\nits functional derivative governs the energy derivative. This\ndependence on vC(r) is particularly evident when the basis\nset is complete, since Eq. ~6! reduces to the Hellmann\u2013\nFeynman force.44 For a given Born\u2013Oppenheimer configu-\nration, this depends only on the density, whose accuracy is\ngoverned by vC(r) through Eqs. ~2! and ~3!.\nAt large separation, the force on a nucleus in a van der\nWaals molecule is almost exclusively due to the dispersion\ninteraction. To describe this dispersion force accurately\nwithin the HFKS formalism therefore requires an accurate\nrepresentation of vC(r) at large separation; integration of this\nforce along the dissociation path yields the dispersion inter-\naction energy. We regard vC(r) as a key quantity, containing\nessential physics of DFT dispersion. The aim of this study is\nto use ab initio electron densities to learn about the structure\nof vC(r) and its relationship to dispersion forces in the he-\nlium dimer He2 .\nWe commence in Sec. II by providing computational de-\ntails and choosing internuclear separations in He2 where dis-\npersion dominates. The physical origin of the dispersion\nforce\u2014a distortion of the atomic densities\u2014is discussed and\nquantified using BD~T! densities. Deficiencies with conven-\ntional correlation potentials are highlighted by considering\nHFKS forces using the Lee\u2013Yang\u2013Parr ~LYP! potential.45\nCorrelation potentials are then determined directly from the\nBD~T! electron densities, using a modified Zhao\u2013Morrison\u2013\nParr ~ZMP! ~Ref. 46! approach. Self-consistent HFKS calcu-\nlations are performed using these potentials and forces are\ndetermined. The partitioning of the correlation potential into\natomic and interaction components is investigated. Conclu-\nsions are presented in Sec. III.\nII. RESULTS\nA. Computational details\nAll calculations were performed using a modified ver-\nsion of the CADPAC program47 with an extensive 7s5p4d\nbasis set on the He atoms, corresponding to the nuclear cen-\ntred part of the DC1BS ~Dc147! basis set of Ref. 48, with\nthe f functions removed for technical reasons. Unless other-\nwise stated, the BD~T!, Hartree\u2013Fock, and DFT forces were\nall evaluated analytically, using conventional rigorous energy\nderivative expressions. Where possible, numerical stability\nwas confirmed by comparing the analytic forces with nu-\nmerical forces determined from energies at perturbed geom-\netries. Basis set superposition errors ~BSSE! affect the shape\nof the interaction energy curve and so also affect the calcu-\nlated forces. All forces were corrected for BSSE by differen-\ntiating the counterpoise energy correction. This requires the\nforce on a single helium atom, calculated in the presence of\nadditional ghost atom basis functions. For DFT calculations,\nthe integration grid on the ghost atom was also included, in\norder to account for integration grid superposition error.\nGiven our extensive basis set, large internuclear separations,\nand near-saturated integration grids, the BSSE corrections to\nthe total forces are very small. To the number of decimal\nplaces quoted they are negligible for all methods except\nBD~T! @where it contributes 0.131026 a.u. ~about 2%! to\nthe forces at 8.0 and 8.5 a.u.#. BSSE corrections to\nHellmann\u2013Feynman forces were slightly larger.\nAll BD~T! densities are relaxed densities. HFKS corre-\nlation potentials were determined from these densities using\nthe methodology of Refs. 49 and 50, which is a modification\nof the ZMP approach,46 based on the constrained search\nformulation.51 The method is as follows. The only terms in\nEq. ~1! that are not explicit functionals of the density are the\nnoninteracting kinetic and orbital exchange energies in\nEHF@$w i%# . Minimization of the sum of these two terms with\nrespect to the orbitals, subject to the constraint that the den-\nsity equals the BD~T! density, gives the HFKS orbitals asso-\nciated with that density. The addition of appropriate explicit\ndensity functionals to the minimization ensures that the re-\nsulting one-electron equations take the same form as Eq. ~3!,\nbut does not change the solution. Comparison of the equa-\ntions then allows vC(r) to be identified in terms of the BD~T!\ndensity, the iterating density, and a Lagrange multi-\n11114 J. Chem.

The one-\nelectron equations are solved within a basis set framework\nand the potential is tabulated numerically on a DFT numeri-\ncal integration grid.\nThe Lagrange multiplier l is formally infinite, although\nfor finite basis sets the BD~T! densities cannot be reproduced\nexactly and so this is inappropriate.52 We considered three\napproaches to circumvent this problem. We considered a fi-\nnite value of l5900, as was used in Ref. 49 and in studies\nof exchange-correlation potentials. We also considered two\nextrapolation schemes. The first, from Ref. 53, involves an\nexpansion from l23 to l11, where the latter term represents\nbasis set incompleteness. The second extrapolation, similar\nto that in Ref. 46, replaces this basis set term with l24. To\nchoose an optimal scheme, we used the fact that the ZMP\niterating density should equal the BD~T! density, and so\nHellmann\u2013Feynman forces from the two should be identical.\nComparison of the forces led us to conclude that the first\nextrapolation scheme did not work well; a similar conclusion\nwas reached in Ref. 49. Forces from l5900 were close to\nthose from the second extrapolation scheme and so for sim-\nplicity we use a finite value of l5900 throughout.\nIn all calculations, He2 is oriented along the z axis. The\nnuclei, which are labeled A and B to distinguish them, are\npositioned at z coordinates zA and zB , respectively, where\nzB.zA and the internuclear separation is R5zB2zA . All\nquoted forces correspond to the force on nucleus A. This acts\nalong the z axis and is equal and opposite to the force on\nnucleus B. ~Forces constructed using approximate ZMP po-\ntentials do not generally satisfy this translational invariance\ncondition because the potentials are not exact functional de-\nrivatives. The homonuclear nature of He2 ensures that this\ncondition is satisfied in the present study.! A positive force\npulls nucleus A towards nucleus B and so represents an at-\ntraction; a negative force is a repulsion.\nB.

The electro-\nstatic theorem of Feynman44\u2014obtained by applying the dif-\nferential Hellmann\u2013Feynman theorem to a nuclear\nperturbation\u2014states that the force on a nucleus is just the\nclassical electrostatic force exerted by the other nuclei and\nthe electron density. For He2 , the exact force on nucleus A is\nthen\nF52\n4\nR2 12E r~r1!rA13 zA1dr1 , ~11!\nwhere the first term is the repulsive force due to nucleus B\nand the second is the force due to the exact density. At large\nR , correlation between electrons on the two atoms causes the\natomic densities to be distorted towards one another. The\nforce due to the density then pulls nucleus A in the direction\nof nucleus B more strongly than they repel one another, re-\nsulting in a net attractive force. Feynman described this dis-\ntortion:\n\u2018\u2018The Schro\u00a8dinger perturbation theory for two interacting\natoms at a separation R , large compared to the radii of the\natoms, leads to the result that the charge distribution of each\nis distorted from central symmetry, a dipole moment of order\n1\/R7 being induced in each atom. The negative charge dis-\ntribution of each atom has its center of gravity moved\nslightly toward the other.\u2019\u2019\nFeynman also conjectured that the leading term in the\ndispersion force on a nucleus arose entirely from the attrac-\ntion of that nucleus to its own distorted density. For He2 , this\nimplies that the R27 component of the force on nucleus A\narises from atom A\u2019s density contribution to the second term\nin Eq. ~11!; this density is polarized towards atom B and so\npulls nucleus A in that direction. Although atom B causes the\ndispersion force on nucleus A, its density and nucleus only\nexplicitly contribute to the higher-order forces. Feynman\u2019s\nconjecture was verified by Hirschfelder and Eliason54 for two\nhydrogen atoms. A general proof has been provided by\nHunt;55 see Refs. 56\u201358 for further discussion.\nIn an approximate electronic structure calculation the\nelectrostatic theorem does not hold exactly, due to finite basis\nsets or nonvariational methodology. Nevertheless, we do find\nthat all our Hartree\u2013Fock, BD~T!, and DFT forces are very\nclose to the Hellmann\u2013Feynman forces ~11! calculated using\ntheir respective densities, demonstrating that the forces in\nthese methods can be rationalized in terms of simple electro-\nstatics; the force reflects the density distortion produced by\nthe method. We shall quantify the distortion using the func-\ntion Dr(r), defined as the density of the dimer minus the\nsum of two isolated atomic densities, positioned at the dimer\nnuclear coordinates; ghost atoms are not included in the\natomic calculations since the isolated atoms must be spheri-\ncal. A positive Dr(r) corresponds to a region where the den-\nsity increases upon dimer formation; a negative value corre-\nsponds to a density decrease.\nTable I presents forces from Hartree\u2013Fock and BD~T!,\ndenoted FHF and FBD~T! , respectively. The former are small,\nrepulsive, and vanish as overlap reduces; the latter are in\nreasonable quantitative agreement with the near-exact val-\nues. The absence of electron correlation in Hartree\u2013Fock\nmeans that the only distortion is due to overlap ~exchange!\neffects, which distorts the atomic densities away from one\nanother.59,60 The attractive force due to the density is then\nsmaller than the nuclear repulsion, resulting in a net repul-\nsive force. The small overlap at these large R values means\nthis distortion\u2014and hence the force\u2014is very small. We do\nnot present plots of Dr(r) for Hartree\u2013Fock since it can be\ndifficult to distinguish the distortion from the numerical\nnoise in the calculations\u2014the Hartree\u2013Fock dimer is essen-\ntially two spherical atoms at these large separations. By con-\ntrast, electron correlation in BD~T! distorts the atomic den-\nsities towards one another as in the exact case, overcoming\nthe small exchange distortion. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2\nwhere Dr(r) for BD~T! is plotted along the He\u2013He bond\naxis for the three R values. At the nuclei, the plots approach\n2182, 2126, and 28831027 a.u. for R58.0, 8.5, and 9.0\na.u., respectively, which are not visible on the scale. On ei-\nther side of each nucleus, Dr(r) exhibits a positive peak,\nwhich is much more pronounced on the side of the nucleus\nnearest to the other atom. Analogous plots have been pre-\nsented for H2 ~Ref. 57!; further discussion on the density of\nrare gas dimers can be found in Ref. 61. The quality of the\nBD~T! density is quantified by calculating the associated\nHellmann\u2013Feynman forces. For R58.0, 8.5, and 9.0 a.u.,\nthe forces are 14.8, 13.2, and 12.131026 a.u., which are\nclose to the near-exact values of Table I.\nWe next consider forces from HFKS calculations. The\nFIG. 2.

The ac-\ncuracy of the HFKS forces will depend on how well this\npotential reproduces the density distortion.\nC. DFT forces and correlation potentials\nWe first consider HFKS calculations using the regular\nLYP correlation functional. Equation ~4! was solved using\nvC(r)5vC,LYPdimer (r), where vC,LYPdimer (r) is the LYP potential of\nthe dimer obtained by applying Eq. ~5! to the LYP energy\nfunctional. The forces ~6!, denoted FDFT@vC,LYP\ndimer # , are pre-\nsented in Table I. They are attractive, which is consistent\nwith previous observations,10 but they are considerably\nsmaller than those of BD~T!, vanishing as overlap reduces.\nThis failure is clearly evident in Fig. 3~a!, where Dr(r) de-\ntermined from LYP HFKS densities is compared with that\nfrom BD~T!, at R59.0 a.u. The atomic densities are slightly\ndistorted towards one another, but the magnitude of the dis-\ntortion is significantly too small.\nTo improve the HFKS forces the correlation potential\nmust be improved. We have therefore used the BD~T! dimer\ndensities as input to our amended ZMP procedure. The cal-\nculated dimer correlation potentials are denoted vC,ZMP\ndimer (r).\nTo determine the associated forces, vC,ZMP\ndimer (r) was calculated\non numerical integration grids, for the three R values, and\nwritten to disk. HFKS calculations were then performed, but\nrather than using a conventional correlation potential, the\nZMP potential was read from disk: i.e., we solve Eq. ~4!\nusing vC(r)5vC,ZMPdimer (r). The equations were converged to\nself-consistency; the resulting orbitals and eigenvalues then\nagree, to within negligible numerical integration error, with\nthose from the ZMP calculation. These orbitals and eigenval-\nues, together with vC,ZMP\ndimer (r), were then used to assemble the\nforce ~6!. We realize that this expression is only strictly valid\nwhen the orbitals and eigenvalues are variationally opti-\nmized; however, previous studies of magnetic properties\nhave demonstrated the practicality of evaluating variational\nexpressions with ZMP quantities.62 The forces determined\nfrom self-consistent calculations using vC,ZMP\ndimer (r) are denoted\nFDFT@vC,ZMP\ndimer # and are presented in Table I.\nThe forces are in good agreement with FBD~T! , quantita-\ntively describing the dispersion force. By construction, a\nHFKS calculation using the ZMP potential gives a density\nclose to BD~T!. It follows that the HFKS calculations repro-\nduce the atomic density distortion, giving high-quality\nforces. Figure 3~b! presents Dr(r) calculated from HFKS\ndensities using vC,ZMP\ndimer (r) for the dimer and the analogous\natomic ZMP potential for the atoms. The plot is almost in-\ndistinguishable from that of BD~T!. The similarity between\nthe HFKS and BD~T! densities is quantified by comparing\ntheir Hellmann\u2013Feynman forces. The HFKS forces are\n14.5, 13.0, and 12.031026 a.u. for R58.0, 8.5, and 9.0\na.u., respectively, compared to the BD~T! values of 14.8,\n13.2, and 12.131026 a.u.\nFigure 4 presents vC,ZMP\ndimer (r), plotted along the He\u2013He\nbond axis for the three R values. The only discernible differ-\nence between the three plots is the increased separation be-\ntween the atomic features. Figure 5 compares vC,ZMPdimer (r) and\nvC,LYP\ndimer (r) at R59 a.u.; they bear minimal resemblance to one\nanother. Previous studies have demonstrated significant dis-\ncrepancies between approximate and near-exact correlation\npotentials in systems such as the helium63 and neon49 atoms.\nD. Partitioning the correlation potential\nIt is important to understand why vC,ZMP\ndimer (r) correctly\ndistorts the atomic densities. On the scale of Fig. 4,\nvC,ZMP\ndimer (r) is indistinguishable from the sum of two atomic\ncorrelation potentials. This leads us to partition the dimer\npotential into two terms\nvC,ZMP\ndimer ~r!5vC,ZMP\natoms ~r!1vC,ZMP\nint ~r!. ~12!\nHere vC,ZMP\natoms (r) is the sum of two independent atomic ZMP\ncorrelation potentials positioned at the dimer nuclear coordi-\nnates, each determined from a BD~T! atomic density.\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nvC,ZMP\nint (r) is an interaction correlation potential, representing\nthe change in the correlation potential that occurs when the\natoms interact.\nTo determine vC,ZMP\natoms (r) on the dimer integration grid, an\natomic ZMP calculation, based on a BD~T! density, was per-\nformed on atom A, with atom B included as a ghost atom\nwith an associated numerical integration grid, but no basis\nfunctions. The calculation was repeated for atom B and the\ntwo potentials were added. The potential was input to HFKS\ncalculations; i.e., we solve Eq. ~4! using vC(r)5vC,ZMPatoms (r).\nThe forces ~6!, denoted FDFT@vC,ZMP\natoms # , are presented in\nTable I.\nThe forces are small and repulsive, very close to the\nHartree\u2013Fock forces. This is because the ZMP correlation\npotential of an isolated helium atom is short ranged. In the\nvicinity of each nucleus, vC,ZMP\natoms (r) is essentially a spherical\natomic potential because the contribution from the potential\non the other atom is so small. vC,ZMP\natoms (r) introduces correla-\ntion appropriate for isolated atoms, but does not cause the\natomic densities to be distorted towards one another; we\nhave confirmed this by examining Dr(r) plots. The ex-\nchange distortion dominates, giving a repulsive force. In es-\nsence, a HFKS calculation using vC,ZMP\natoms (r) generates two\nBD~T!-like atoms that have an exchange, but no dispersion\ninteraction.\nThe dispersion force therefore arises due to vC,ZMP\nint (r),\nwhich is the subtle difference between vC,ZMP\ndimer (r) and\nvC,ZMP\natoms (r). To demonstrate this we have performed HFKS\ncalculations using just vC,ZMPint (r) as the correlation potential;\ni.e., we solve Eq. ~4! using vC(r)5vC,ZMPint (r). The forces ~6!,\ndenoted FDFT@vC,ZMP\nint # , are presented in Table I. To the pre-\ncision quoted, they are indistinguishable from those obtained\nwith the full dimer potential. By examining Dr(r) plots, we\nhave confirmed that vC,ZMP\nint (r) alone quantitatively repro-\nduces the atomic density distortion.\nThe reason why vC,ZMP\nint (r) generates the distortion is\nclear from Fig. 6, where the potential is plotted for the three\nR values; note the smaller scale compared to Fig. 4. For each\nplot, the potential is asymmetric in the vicinity of each\nnucleus. It reduces in moving from the far side to the near\nside of each nucleus and so shifts density to the near side,\ndistorting the atomic densities towards one another. The po-\ntentials were calculated by subtracting two approximate ZMP\npotentials, so we cannot be sure that all features are quanti-\ntatively accurate; for example, the oscillatory behavior near\nthe nuclei is sensitive to the basis set and other convergence\ncriteria. However, the general structure is not sensitive to\nprecise computational details.\nDespite giving essentially identical dispersion forces,\nHFKS calculations using vC,ZMP\nint (r) and vC,ZMPdimer (r) are funda-\nmentally different. At large R ,\nlim\nR\u2192\u2018\nvC,ZMP\nint ~r!50, ~13!\nbut\nlim\nR\u2192\u2018\nvC,ZMP\ndimer ~r!5vC,ZMP\natoms ~r!, ~14!\nand so, asymptotically, the former yields two Hartree\u2013Fock\natoms whereas the latter yields two BD~T!-like atoms. Quan-\ntitatively similar dispersion forces can therefore be obtained\nthrough a minor distortion of Hartree\u2013Fock or BD~T!-like\natoms. It is the distortion that matters, not the underlying\natom.\nFIG. 4. Correlation potentials vC,ZMPdimer (r) plotted along the He\u2013He bond axis\nfor the three R values.\nFIG. 5.

CONCLUSIONS\nThe dispersion interaction has been considered from the\nviewpoint of the force on a nucleus. When the HFKS method\nis used to implement this viewpoint, the key to an accurate\ndispersion force is an accurate correlation potential at large\ninternuclear separation; this contrasts conventional ap-\nproaches, which tend to focus on the correlation energy\nrather than the potential. We have used coupled-cluster\nBD~T! electron densities to investigate the potential and its\nrelationship to dispersion forces in the helium dimer.\nBD~T! dispersion forces are in good agreement with\nnear-exact values. The BD~T! densities have been used to\nquantify the atomic density distortion associated with the\ndispersion force. HFKS calculations using the conventional\nLYP potential only generate a small distortion, giving forces\nsignificantly smaller than BD~T!. The BD~T! densities have\ntherefore been used to determine improved correlation poten-\ntials, using a modified ZMP approach; the potentials differ\nconsiderably from LYP. HFKS calculations using these po-\ntentials accurately reproduce the distortion, giving forces in\ngood agreement with BD~T!. The correlation potential has\nbeen partitioned into atomic and interaction parts. HFKS cal-\nculations using the latter generate the density distortion, giv-\ning dispersion forces essentially identical to those from the\nfull dimer potential. The origin of this distortion can be\ntraced to the asymmetric structure of the interaction correla-\ntion potential in the vicinity of each nucleus.\nThe DFT calculations in this study rely on the underly-\ning BD~T! calculation and so do not represent a practical\napproach for determining dispersion forces. However,\nknowledge of the structure of the correlation potential at\nlarge separation may prove useful in the development of new\nenergy functionals that correctly describe dispersion. At a\nmore pragmatic level, they may aid the development of new\nmodel potentials or procedures for correcting existing poten-\ntials.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to the EPSRC for studentship\nsupport and to A.
