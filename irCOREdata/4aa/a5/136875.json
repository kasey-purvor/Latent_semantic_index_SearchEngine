While keratinocytes are a major source of this pro-inflammatory eicosanoid, epidermal melanocytes (EM) also express some of the cellular machinery required for PGE2 production. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether EM can produce PGE2 and so potentially also contribute to UVR-induced skin inflammation. Furthermore, we investigate the likely pathway by which this PGE2 production is achieved and investigate whether PGE2 production by EM is correlated with melanogenic capacity. Primary cultures of EM were established from nine normal healthy individuals with skin phototype-1 (n=4) and 4 (n=5), and PGE2 production and melanogenic status were assessed. EM produced PGE2 under baseline conditions and this was increased further upon stimulation with arachidonic acid. Moreover, EM expressed cytoplasmic phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-1 and cytoplasmic prostaglandin E synthase. However, no EM culture expressed cyclooxygenase-2 under baseline conditions or following arachidonic acid, UVB- or H2O2 treatments. PGE2 production in response to UVB was highly variable in EM cultures derived from different donors but when pooled for skin phototype exhibited a positive correlation only with SPT-1 derived EM. Interestingly, PGE2 production by EM in response to UVB showed no correlation with baseline levels of melanin, tyrosinase expression\/activity or tyrosinase-related protein-1 expression. However, there was an apparent negative correlation with baseline expression of dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), a melanogenic enzyme with reported anti-oxidant potential. These findings suggest that EM have the potential to contribute to UVR-induced erythema via PGE2 production, but that this response may be more related to oxidative stress than to their melanogenesis status.The Wellcome TrustOpen access articl","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Wiley","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:bradscholars.brad.ac.uk:10454\/4579<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2014-05-19T14:11:27Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_10454_152<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_10454_6342<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nProstaglandin-E2 is produced by adult human epidermal melanocytes in response to UVB in a melanogenesis-independent manner.<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nGledhill, Karl<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRhodes, Lesley E.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nBrownrigg, M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nHaylett, A.
