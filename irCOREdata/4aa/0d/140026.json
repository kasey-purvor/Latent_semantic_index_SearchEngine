The earliest development of micropump was in 1980 with \na peristaltic micropump using piezoelectric biomorphies [3]. The earliest silicon micropump, \nthat uses sputtering of the piezoelectric films directly onto the silicon pump diaphragm, was \npresented in 1988 [4]. Since then, many other integrated silicon based micropumps, mostly \nusing piezoelectric actuation, were presented [5, 6]. Silicon MEMS micropumps have found \nseveral commercial applications for insulin delivery, in gas control as fluidic valves and in \ninject technology [7-8]. Reyes et al. [9] provides a comprehensive overview of the important \ndevelopments in technology, theoretical understanding and applications in the field. During \nthe developments, a continuous challenge has been the transport and pumping of small \nquantities of biological fluids on the order of a few micro\/mill-litres per minutes.  \n However, material cost of silicon and elaborate micro-manufacturing processes burden \nthe use of such silicon micropumps because the micropumps require expensive silicon \nmicromachining facilities and processes. The use of plastics has already been shown to have \ngreat potential to reduce the fabrication cost. This is due to the fact that plastics are \ndisposable, low cost, and offer a competitive manufacturing process in mass production [10]-\n[12]. To date, several of micropumps have been developed. Examples include ThinXXs [13], \nBartels Mikrotechnik [14], and Star Micronics Companies [15] use Cyclo-Olefin-Copolymers \nor Polyimide as the pump body material. Nevertheless, the pumps have passive micro check \nvalves and require advanced micro-manufacturing processes and specialized assembly \ntechniques. Richter et al. [16] have recently developed a plastic micropump which comprises \nfive parts: one plastic pump body, one metal diaphragm, and three piezoelectric ceramics. \nThis micropump overcomes the passive micro check valve drawback by having a simple \n 3\nvalve actuation design: piezoelectrically actuated diaphragm valves without requiring any \nvalve flap. The use of plastic material in the simplified structural design, fabrication and \nassembly processes, and makes the pump attractive for low cost applications. While the \nmicropump has been presented before, its optimization design has not been done yet. \nIn this paper, therefore, we focus on optimization of the piezoelectrically actuated \ndiaphragm for actuation capability and reliability of the micropump. This is mainly due to the \nfact that the higher the applied voltage, the higher the deflection of diaphragm and thus the \nhigher the pump flow rate. But a higher applied voltage will lead to a higher stress and a \nhigher strain in the piezoelectric ceramics and possibly makes the pump unreliable to operate \nif the stress and strain is beyond material strength due to brittle nature of piezoelectric \nceramics. In order to make sure of the pump with high pumping rate and high reliability, there \nis a need to predict the pump actuation capability and reliability and optimize geometric \ndimensional design of the piezoelectric diaphragm. The results presented consist of work \npreviously reported in a proceeding paper [17] with comparisons of computational and \nexperimental results.   \n \n2 Description of the micro-pump \nA multi-material micropump studied here is shown in Fig.1 in an exploded view. It is \ncomprised of solely five functional parts: one plastic body, one metal diaphragm, and three \npiezoelectric ceramics. Three piezoelectric ceramics are glued onto the metal diaphragm to \nform three actuation units to control diaphragm valve opening and closing for generation of \npumping motion. The metal diaphragm is bonded to the plastic body to form two valve seats \non the left and right, and one pump chamber sit in the centre.  \nA photo of plastic micropump body is shown in Fig. 2. An interconnection channel with a slot \nshape between valve seats and micro-pump chamber are designed to allow the flow through \nfluidic chambers and so as to reduce the flow resistance. A capillary stop channel is also \n 4\ndesigned around the plastic body to prevent glue to flow into the chambers after bonding the \nmetal diaphragm to the plastic body. Because there are burrs at the edges after dicing of the \nmetal diaphragm, a burr channel was also designed to absorb the burr of the metal diaphragm \nafter assembly. The electrical connections to the top and bottom of piezoelectric ceramics \nwere done by wire bonding to a standard connector. \nThe operational principle of the pump is described as follows. When a proper voltage is \napplied to one of the piezoelectric ceramics, there will be a downward deflection in the metal \ndiaphragm. For example, the downward deflection, shown in Fig. 3, will close the left orifice \nin the plastic body and the valve will be closed if the piezoelectric ceramics is able to excite \nan enough deflection in the metal diaphragm. When the applied voltage is zero, there will be \nno downward deflection in the metal diaphragm and the valve will be opened. Furthermore, \nwhen there are three alternative electrical voltages with given phase shifts, shown in Fig. 3, \nindependently applied to the piezoelectric ceramics, the valves will be opened and closed with \na proper sequence and then pumping mode will be generated. As the phase shifts among three \nelectrical signals are adjustable, the fluid can be pumped from the left seat to the right seat, \nand vice versa. So the pump is capable of pumping bidirectional. It is worthwhile to mention \nthat a negative voltage is also applied to the designed micro-pumps because the negative \nvoltage has an advantage of exciting an upward deflection to reduce the fluidic resistance of \nthe valves and increase the pump volume. \nIn order for the pump to handle and dose chemical gases and liquids, Polyether-ether-\nketone (PEEK) of plastics was chosen as material for the pump body because PEEK has the \nproperty of very good stability and resistance to a broad range of chemical gases and liquids. \nIt should be mentioned that PEEK is an expensive material but only a small amount of PEEK \n(a few grams) is needed for the micropump and so a low cost micropump can still be \nachieved. It should be noted that for a true low cost it is advisable to use a different material \n 5\nrather than PEEK and a further investigation of the pump body material is needed. However, \nthis issue is outside the scope of the current paper. Stainless steel (no.1.4310, from Ergeste) \nwas chosen as material for the metal diaphragm. Adhesives for bonding between the metal \ndiaphragm and the plastic body have been tested and special methanol stable epoxy glue is \nutilised. Since the glue is stable to methanol solvents, the pump is capable for fuel cell \napplications. In addition, to improve the sealing of the interface and prevent the leakage of the \npump, a layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer (PDMS Sylgard, Dow Chemicals) \nwas deposited to the metal diaphragm by spin coating with a two step process: the first step \nwith 1500r\/min and the second step with 6000r\/min. The ratio between binder and hardener \nwas chosen to be 9:1. The layer was hardened for 5 min on a hot plate. These layers had a \nthickness of 6\u00b5m. \n \n3 Optimization of the piezoelectric diaphragm \nAs general rule the higher the applied voltage, the higher the deflection of diaphragm and \nthe higher the pump flow rate. Unfortunately, a higher deflection leads to a higher stress and a \nhigher strain in the piezoelectric ceramics and further leads to the piezoelectric actuator \nreliability deficiency if the stress and strain is beyond material strength due to brittle nature of \npiezoelectric ceramics. In order to ensure the pump work reliably, this section will study the \nmicropump actuation capability and reliability and then based on the study, obtain an \noptimized dimensional design for the piezoelectric diaphragm.  \n \n3.1 FEA Method \nCommercially available finite element analysis (FEA) software (ANSYS Inc. Canonsburg, \nPA), was utilized to calculate actuation capability and reliability of piezoelectrically actuated \ndiaphragm. Here the actuation capability means how much deflection piezoelectric ceramics \ncan excite in the diaphragm and the reliability means that the maximum stress and strain \n 6\ngenerated in the metal diaphragm and the piezoelectric ceramics should be below material \nstrength limits. So the deflection of the diaphragm, below called stroke (S), and the maximum \nstress in metal diaphragm )( max,m\u03c3  and the maximum stress and strain in piezoelectric \nceramics )\/ (  max, max, pp \u03b5\u03c3  were chosen as the criteria to measure the actuation capability and \nreliability of the micropump as described below. The reason for this is that the stroke and \nstress are the key performance parameters for optimized structural design with a higher pump \nflow rate and for ensuring the maximum stress and strain within material strength. \nThe geometric parameters of modelled piezoelectric diaphragm are shown in Fig. 5. The \nmetal diaphragm in-plane dimensions were designed to be fixed at 44mm \u00d716.95mm with the \nthickness of 0.05mm, and the valve chamber sizes were fixed at 14mm (l) \u00d714mm (l) with \nradius fillet of 4.8mm at the corners, where l represents the lateral dimension of the square \nvalve seat, in-plane dimensions of the valve chamber sizes and pump chamber are designed  \nbased on the designed flow rate, and the depth are designed to adapt to strokes actuated by \npiezoelectric ceramics. Piezoelectric ceramic structural parameters, pp ll \u00d7  and tt p , were \nchosen to be variable, where pl and pt represent the length and thickness of square \npiezoelectric ceramics, respectively, t is the thickness of metal diaphragm and so tt p  is the \nratio of the thicknesses. It should be noticed that ll p <  due to structural limitation. As the glue \nis very thin, the thickness of glue is ignored in all the simulations.  \nThe developed FEM model of piezoelectric diaphragm is shown in Fig. 6 with meshes. \nThe model uses the 8-node, hexahedral, coupled-field element SOLID5 for the piezoelectric \nmaterials and the 8-node, linear, structural element SOLID45 for the non-piezoelectric \nmaterials. The material parameters and geometrical dimensions used in the model are listed in \nTable 1 except where specifically mentioned in the text. Static analyses were performed to \ndetermine the stroke, the maximum stress in the metal diaphragm and the maximum \n 7\nstress\/strain in the piezoelectric ceramics.  \n \n3.2 FEA results and analyses \nA. Distribution of simulated deflection \nFig. 7 shows the distribution of simulated deflection along the metal diaphragm length \ndirection when a voltage of 100 volts is applied to the left, centre, and right piezoelectric \nceramics, respectively. It can be seen that a large stroke, about 62\u00b5m, is achieved in all three \nchambers for the designed micro-pump with the dimensions listed in Table 1. As a large \nstroke leads to a high pumping rate, the micropump has a potential of pumping high volume \nof fluids and gases. \nB S and mmax,\u03c3  as functions of aV  \nFig. 8 shows ,S  which occurs at the centre of diaphragm, and mmax,\u03c3 , which occurs at the  \nfour corners of piezoelectric ceramics in the metal diaphragm, as functions of .aV  From Fig. \n8, it can be seen that the higher ,aV  the higher S and the higher .max,m\u03c3  It seems that there is a  \nlinear relationship between S and ,aV  and between S  and .max,m\u03c3   However, it should be \nborne in mind that there is a non-linearity in reality when the applied voltage is larger than \n100 volts. The reason for leading to this conclusion is that a linear piezoelectric theory is used \nin the simulation.  \nC. S and mmax,\u03c3  as functions of pl  \nFig. 9 shows S  and mmax,\u03c3  as a function of the piezoelectric ceramics length .pl  From Fig. \n9, it can be observed that when pl  increases but mm6.9<pl , S  and mmax,\u03c3  increase but when \nmm6.9>pl , S starts to decrease  and mmax,\u03c3  starts to increase sharply. So there exists an \noptimized piezoelectric ceramics length pl  for the optimized design, which is 9.6mm and \nmeans that the pump designed at this length has a potential of achieving a higher stroke and \nnot suffering higher maximum stress when the chamber size is designed at 14mm\u00d714mm with \n 8\nradius fillet of 4.8mm.  \nD. S and mmax,\u03c3  as functions of tt p \/  \nFig. 10 shows S  and mmax,\u03c3  as a function of tt p \/ , where t is fixed at 0.05mm. For a \ncomparative study reason, the electric field strength applied to the piezoelectric ceramics was \nfixed at 1000 volts\/mm for all the simulations and this leads to the relationship that the \napplied voltage is proportional to .tt p  From Fig. 10, it can be seen that when tt p =1.4, that \nis, 70=pt \u00b5m, S reaches a maximum value, about 67 \u00b5m; when tt p >1.4, S starts to decrease \nwhile mmax,\u03c3 continues rising until 4.2=tt p , that is, 120=pt \u00b5m, and then mmax,\u03c3  almost \nkeeps a level, about 166MPa when .4.2=tt p  Theoretically, an optimized tp\/t for designed \nmicro-pump should be taken to be 1.4, that is, m,70\u00b5=pt  as this value could make the pump \nhave the largest stroke and suffer the highest stress. But due to difficulties in fabrication of \nsuch thin bulk piezoelectric ceramics and the availability of minimum thickness of \npiezoelectric ceramics is about 100\u00b5m for the time being, tp is designed at 100\u00b5m for the \ndeveloped and tested pump. It is worthwhile to mention that, for 0.6 < tt p <1.4, that is, 30 \n\u00b5m < 70<pt \u00b5m, piezoelectric ceramics could be available in the thick film form although \ncurrently the available piezoelectric coefficients of the thick film are much less than those in \nbulk form because thick film material is a relative new and still in the development stage. If \nsimilar piezoelectric coefficients of thick film as those of bulk material are achieved, it is \nrecommended to utilize thick film piezoelectric ceramics to design the micropump because \nthey could excite a higher stroke. Furthermore, for 2.0<tt p , that is, 10<pt \u00b5m, it can be \nseen that the actuated stroke is very small, about 17.5\u00b5m at tt p =0.2, not enough to form \npumping motion for the designed pump. So it is not recommended to use thin film \npiezoelectric ceramic to design the micro-pump due to the small stroke. \n 9\nE. pmax,\u03c3  and pmax,\u03b5  for piezoelectric ceramics \nFigs. 11, 12 and 13 show pmax,\u03c3 and pmax,\u03b5  in the piezoelectric ceramics as functions of aV , \npl and ,tt p  respectively. From these figures, very similar conclusions can be drawn as ones \nfrom Figs. 8, 9 and 10. Because of brittle nature of piezoelectric ceramics, piezoelectric \nmaterial can not be subjected to a higher tensile stress and a higher tensile strain than material \nstrength limits. So for reliability analyses of piezoelectric ceramics, the tensile strain no more \nthan 0.1%, that is, %,1.0max, <p\u03b5  was chosen as a criterion during reliability study. Because \ntensile strain in piezoelectric ceramics is larger than 0.1%, it will possibly cause the \npiezoelectric ceramics to crack So from Figs. 11, 12, 13, it can be concluded that the \noptimized applied voltage is about 100 volts and optimized structural parameters are \nmmlp 6.9=  and 2=tt p , that is, ,100 mtp \u00b5= and the designed pump using such parameters \ncan have maximum stroke and work reliably. \n \n4 Micropump testing \nTaking the optimized geometry parameters obtained in the simulation, three piezoelectric \nceramics were glued onto the metal diaphragm. To verify the capabilities of piezoelectric \nactuators, the strokes of the left, centre, and right diaphragms were measured at voltages \nbetween 20 volts and 100 volts by use of the laser profilometry laser scan system (Microfocus \nfrom UBM, USA). Similar measurement results were obtained and Fig. 14 shows the strokes \nactuated by the central piezoelectric ceramics at the diaphragm. A very large stroke, about \n55\u00b5m, was achieved at the applied voltage of 100 volts. It is also observed that the higher the \napplied voltage, the higher the stroke when 100<V volts. The trend well agrees with the \nsimulation results in Section 3, shown in Fig. 8. It should be mentioned that there is some \ndifference between the simulated and tested results in the stroke through comparisons, shown \nin Fig. 8. The possible reasons are that (1) actual piezoelectric ceramic property parameters \nvary from the catalogue parameters and (2) the tolerances of the piezoelectric ceramic \ngeometric dimensions possibly causes the difference. \nMicropumps with and without PDMS coating were fabricated and tested. Figs. 15 and 16 \n 10\nshow forward and backward flow rates of the micropump with PDMS coating as function of \nactuation frequency, for air and water. From these figures, it can be seen that the micropump \nenables to pump water and air and bidirectional pumping (forward and backward pumping) \nand the flow rates is a function of actuation frequency. The maximum flow rates of 39 ml\/min \nwere achieved for air at the actuation frequency of about 225Hz and applied voltage of 100 \nvolts, and 1.8ml\/min for water at about 17 Hz. As mentioned in Section 2, PDMS coating is \nused to improve the sealing and prevent the leakage of the micro pump at the interface. Tested \nresults have shown a good improvement of pumping performance in flow rate as for the \nmicropump without PDMS coating. \n \n5 Conclusions \nAn optimisation design of the micropump, using multi-materials for low cost applications, \nhas been presented with actuation and fluidic test results in this paper. As the micropump \ncomprises solely five functional parts: one plastic pump body, one metal diaphragm and three \npiezoelectric ceramics, the micropump has a simple structure, easy to assemble and suitable \nfor low cost applications. Furthermore, the pump body is made of Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone \n(PEEK), which is chemical inertia for a broad range of liquid and gases, so it is able to work \nwith aggressive gases and liquids.  \nA detailed parameter design analysis and optimization of piezoelectric diaphragm has \nbeen performed based on 3D finite element method (FEM). An optimized geometric \ndimensional design: the ratio of thicknesses between the piezoelectric ceramics and the metal \ndiaphragm, and the lateral dimension of the piezoelectric ceramics length, has been obtained \nand based on the optimized parameters, a micropump was fabricated and tested. The tested \nresults show that such optimized dimensions have a high pump flow rate for air up to \n39ml\/min and for water up to 1.8ml\/min currently.   \n 11\nIt is believed that the micro-pump is very promising to go into the commercial market to \nhandle aggressive liquids and gases at low pressures in bio-medical and drug delivery \nsystems. But it is worthwhile to admit that there is still a lot further work to be done before \nthis can happen. For example, there are needs to study effects of the backing pressure on the \npumping rate and further to reduce the plastic body material (PEEK) cost and silicone \nelastomer materials (PDMS) cost.  Our targeted pump costs at high volume production (> \n106\/year) is a needed control within the order of magnitude of 1\u20ac\/pump (plastic part: 0.1\u20ac, \npiezoelectric ceramics: 3\u00d70.1\u20ac, metal diaphragm: 0.02\u20ac, assembly and test: 0.4\u20ac).  \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the network excellence \u201cMulti-\nMaterial-Micro-Manufacture\u201d (4M). \n \n 12\nReferences \n1.
