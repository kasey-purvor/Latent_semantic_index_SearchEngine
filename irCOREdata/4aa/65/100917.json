Its large band gap of 5.48 eV results in solar blindness\nand low leakage currents during room temperature\noperation,3 for example, in high energy physics\nexperiments,4 medical dosimetry,2 beam monitoring,4 and\nneutron detection.5\nThe detector performance and stability are determined\nby structural imperfections and impurities in the material,\nwhich influence the induced current signal. In polycrystalline\ndiamond detectors it is known that grain boundaries act as\ncharge trapping centers, severely limiting the spectroscopic\nperformance. Ion beam induced charge \u0001IBIC\u0002 imaging has\nbeen used routinely to study diamond radiation detectors,\ntheir priming behavior, and interactions due to optical\nillumination.6 Recently, single crystal chemical vapor depos-\nited \u0001CVD\u0002 diamond has been synthesized successfully in a\nnumber of laboratories.7\u20139 This material allows us to study\nthe effect of defects on charge transport in the absence of\ngrain boundaries.\nIn this work, we present a combination of luminescence\nand IBIC imaging in a synthetic single crystal diamond pro-\nvided by Element Six Ltd. \u0001UK\u0002. The spatial defect distribu-\ntion of the material has been investigated using a photograph\nof the luminescence excited by \u0001227 nm wavelength ultra-\nviolet \u0001UV\u0002 irradiation of a xenon lamp. Cathodolumines-\ncence \u0001CL\u0002 spectral imaging at room temperature has been\ncarried out at the University of Strathclyde10 with an electron\nenergy of 10 keV and typical beam currents of 4\u201310 nA.\nIBIC images were acquired at room temperature at the\nnuclear microbeam facility of the Surrey Ion Beam Centre.11\nThe IBIC spatial resolution is limited to 10 \u0002m by the num-\nber of pixels in the scan area.\nEach proton interaction produces electron hole pairs,\ncorresponding to a charge Q0 in the device, and the charge\ncarriers drift through the material according to the electric\nfield. The induced current pulse is integrated by an Ortec 142\nA charge sensitive preamplifier followed by an Ortec 570\nshaping amplifier. The amplitude Q of each interaction is\nproportional to the carrier drift length; it is calibrated in\nterms of charge collection efficiency CCE=Q \/Q0, using a\n100% efficient silicon pin diode. The average electron-hole\npair creation energies are 3.6 and 13.2 eV in silicon and\ndiamond, respectively.12,13\nThe sample dimensions were 2.4\u00032.9\u00030.49 mm3, cut\nvertically through the wafer grown by a microwave en-\nhanced plasma CVD method. During the growth process,\nnitrogen was deliberately introduced into the growth reactor\nfor short periods of time, in order to study its effect on the\nmaterial properties. Consequently, thin layers of nitrogen en-\nriched material are found at various distances from the high-\npressure high-temperature \u0001HPHT\u0002 diamond substrate. These\nlayers are easily identified as the orange lines in the lumines-\ncence image shown in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. Vertical line structures in\nblue are also distinguishable, associated with band A lumi-\nnescence from dislocation bundles in diamond.14 The CL\nconfirms that outside the nitrogen doped areas only band A\nluminescence is observed. While it is primarily concentrated\nin vertical dislocation bundles, it is also observed throughout\nthe sample as low intensity pointlike luminescence centers,\nvisible in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. The HPHT synthesized substrate emits\nvery bright blue luminescence and charged strongly during\nthe electron irradiation of the CL experiment. The CL spectra\nshown in Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002 are extracted from the indicated positions\nin Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. The spectrum extracted from the nitrogen doped\nlayer exhibits the known signature of a neutral nitrogen-\nvacancy complex15 and another nitrogen related defect signal\nwith a peak position around 2.33 eV.16\nFor the IBIC experiments, Ohmic contacts were formed\non the front and on the back side of the sample using evapo-\nrated Ti\/Au \u000150 nm\/30 nm\u0002, which were annealed at\n673 K.17 A 2.58 MeV proton beam is electrostatically\nscanned over the investigated sample surface, with typically\nless than 1500 s\u22121 incident particles. The detector bias V was\nconnected to the irradiated contact via the preamplifier,\nwhereas the back electrode was grounded. The range of the\nparticles is x=35 \u0002m,18 which is small compared to thea\u0002Electronic mail: a.lohstroh@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 90, 102111 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/90\u000210\u0001\/102111\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics90, 102111-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Consequently, pulses acquired\nunder positive bias supply are sensitive to hole transport,\nwhereas pulses acquired under negative bias are produced by\nelectron drift.\nCharge carrier mobility-lifetime products \u0001\u0002\u0004\u0002 can be\nmeasured using the modified Hecht equation for single\ncharge carrier transport given in expression \u00011\u0002, which de-\nscribes the CCE as a function of V under the assumption of a\nconstant electric field throughout the detector thickness d.12\nA constant offset x \/d has been added to account for the small\ncontribution of the opposite charge carrier type,\nCCE =\n\u0002\u0004V\nd2 \u00051 \u2212 exp\u0006\u2212 \u00061 \u2212 xd\u0007\u0006 d2\u0002\u0004V\u0007\u0007\b + xd . \u00011\u0002\nIBIC maps of the detector response were taken at a num-\nber of bias voltages between 30 and 150 V for both polari-\nties. Figure 2 displays a typical CCE map acquired at V\n\u0005100 V for both electron and hole signals. The top edge of\nthe contact is not well defined in the IBIC data, which is\nprobably caused by a small displacement and\/or silver paint\nat the rear contact. The HPHT substrate does not show any\ninduced signals above the threshold level of the system.\nThe overall pulse height spectra averaged over the total\nscan area shown in Fig. 3 exhibit well resolved peaks for\nelectron and hole dominated signals. For comparison, pulse\nheight spectra extracted from a rectangular selected region\u2014\nindicated in Fig. 2\u2014are also displayed, which demonstrate a\nreduction in peak width indicating the more homogeneous\nresponse in areas which are less affected by defects. In gen-\neral, the width of the hole peak is narrower than for electrons\nand more than 95% CCE has been reached, corresponding to\na mean drift length \u0002\u0004V \/d of more than 3 mm.\nThe insets in Fig. 3 show the CCE peak positions from\nthe selected area as a function of bias supply. Polarization\nwas observed during the irradiation of the sample, modifying\nthe electric field experienced by the moving charges. The\npolarization field varied with sample position19 and intro-\nduces variations in the behavior expected by the Hecht equa-\ntion \u0003Eq. \u00011\u0002\u0004. \u0002\u0004 in the selected area is estimated as 6\u00b12\n\u000310\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 for electrons and 8\u00b13\u000310\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 for\nholes.\nThese values are two orders of magnitude below the val-\nues reported by Isberg et al.20 which have been measured\nusing higher created charge densities produced by UV irra-\ndiation. Published values for carrier mobilities in diamond\nvary from 1000 up to 4500 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121.3,7,21,22 Accordingly,\nthe carrier lifetimes in our samples are in the order of a few\ntens of nanoseconds.\nThe reduced signal height along the nitrogen enriched\nlines is shown very clearly in Figs. 2 and 4\u0001a\u0002. These data\ndirectly confirm that nitrogen impurities reduce the \u0002\u0004 of\nelectrons and holes, consistent with a nitrogen related defect\nacting as a recombination center.23 Although less strong, the\nbands showing strong band A luminescence intensity also\nexhibit degraded electron and hole charge transports com-\npared to their surroundings, illustrated in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002. The areas\nof enhanced band A luminescence emission, corresponding\nto dislocations, coincide clearly with reduced CCE; thus dis-\nlocations reduce \u0002\u0004 for both carrier types and the same line\nof argument as for the nitrogen lines also indicates a recom-\nbination center in this case.23 On the other hand, the \u201cfading\u201d\nof the dislocation effect visible in Fig. 2 towards the sub-\nstrate area demonstrates that a homogeneous CCE profile can\nbe achieved despite the presence of dislocations at high field\nstrength, i.e., at high charge carrier velocities.

Additionally, the study\nconfirms the degradation of charge transport due to the pres-\nence of nitrogen in synthetic single crystal CVD diamond.\n1A. Mainwood, Semicond. Sci.
