Such mesh networks typically comprise a wireless\nbackbone connected to the wired infrastructure with wireless\nclient residing at the edge. The wireless routers and access points\nof a wireless mesh network (WMN) are connected by shared links\nthat often use the same channel. The capacity of a WMN depends\non several factors such as network size and topology, traffic\nprofile, number of radio interfaces per node, number of radio\nchannels, channel assignment scheme, routing algorithm etc. In\nthis paper, we describe an analytical framework for capacity\nestimation using the notion of collision domains. Furthermore,\nwe analyse the capacity of WMNs under various scenarios to\nstudy the impact of different network parameters.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWireless mesh networks have generated a lot of interest\nin recent years, both in the industry as well as the research\ncommunity. These networks can potentially be used in a wide\nrange of applications [1]. WMNs are deployed by Internet\nService Providers for last-mile connectivity. In this case,\nsome of the WMN nodes are directly connected to the fixed\ninfrastructure via wired links thereby enabling the remaining\nnodes to get access via them using multi-hop wireless paths.\nIn Metropolitan Area Network scenarios, the wired backhaul\nis replaced with city-wide WMNs using comprising wireless\nrouters. For the case of enterprise networks, access points are\nconnected together in mesh topology with a wireless backbone.\nIn all these scenarios, replacement of wired infrastructure with\nWMN drives down the overall deployment cost and creates a\nmore flexible network topology.\nThe most commonly used mesh architecture is where a\nwireless backbone is connected to the fixed infrastructure via\none or more wired links. This is referred to as infrastructure\nor backbone WMN. Such a network comprises a set of\nnodes connected by wireless links, with one or more of the\nnodes directly connected to the global Internet. The latter are\nreferred to as gateways. Nodes in a backbone WMN can be\nclient devices, wireless access points and wireless routers.\nWireless routers and access points are typically fixed and\nhence, WMNs made up entirely of such devices will have a\nstable topology whereas WMNs made up of client devices only\nwill be dynamic in general. In the following, unless mentioned\notherwise, the term WMN refers to backbone mesh networks\ncomprising wireless access points and routers with one or more\nclient nodes at the edge.\nThe design and deployment of a WMN for any application\nscenario is challenging because there are several interlinked\nfactors that can impact the performance of the network.\nSome of them are network-related such as network topology,\ntraffic profile etc. Other factors are radio related, for example,\nfrequency band, channel bandwidth, number of available chan-\nnels, number of radios per node etc. Several different metrics\nare used to quantify WMN performance including capacity,\nthroughput, goodput, delay etc. Among these, capacity is\nundoubtedly one of the most important indicators. In this\npaper, we address the issue of capacity estimation of multi-\nradio, multi-channel WMNs.\nCapacity analysis of multi-hop wireless networks has proven\nto be an interesting and challenging research topic which is\nreflected in the wide body of related literature [2] [3] [4]\n[5] [6]. In [2], lower and upper bounds of network capacity\nwere determined. This work also provided the important result\nthat there is a significant decrease in throughput capacity per\nnode as node density increases. However, the analysis does\nnot capture routing-related effects and assumes that all paths\nfollow straight lines. Thus, it can only be applied to WMNs in\nwhich nodes are organised in a chain topology. A theoretical\nframework for determining the nominal capacity of WMNs\nwas described in [7]. The concept of collision domains is\nused to determine the bottleneck link in the network and\nupper bound on capacity calculated. The analytical model\nwas validated using simulations. However, only single channel\nWMNs were considered.\nThe capacity of WMNs depends on the available radio\ncapacity. Given the fact that, in most cases, nodes in backbone\nWMN are dedicated wireless routers and access points, it is\nreasonable to assume that these nodes have multiple radios\nthereby enabling use of multiple channels. An important aspect\nof multi-radio multi-channel mesh networks is the assignment\nof radio channels to interfaces. [8] [9] propose an integrated\nchannel assignment and routing algorithm for multi-radio\nmulti-channel WMNs. An iterative algorithm based on greedy\nchannel assignment is used. However, the topology used in\nthis study had ingress-egress node pairs distributed randomly.\nThis maybe true when the WMN is operating in an ad-hoc\nnetworking scenario but in backbone WMNs, the ingress-\negress pairs are not randomly distributed. A new routing metric\nfor multi-radio WMNs was defined in [10] to capture loss rate\nand link bandwidth. This metric is then used to select the best\npaths for routing packets.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 12,2010 at 15:43:35 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nAlthough, the research cited above studied the capacity of\nWMNs, the scenarios used tend to be rather specific. There\nis a need to determine WMN capacity for a wider range\nof scenarios so as to provide insights into the impact of\ndifferent design factors such as network topology, network\nsize, routing methods, channel assignment schemes etc on the\ncapacity of WMNs. In this paper, the relationships between\nthese design parameters and the capacity of multi-radio, multi-\nchannel WMNs are explored.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. In the next\nsection, we briefly explain the notion of collision domains.\nIt is followed by the description of an analytical framework\nto estimate WMN capacity. We estimate the capacity of\nWMNs for different scenarios in Section IV. Finally, Section\nV contains the main conclusions from this work.\nII. COLLISION DOMAINS\nCollision domains arise due to the shared nature of wireless\nlinks that connect WMN nodes. Use of a common channel\nimplies that when a node is transmitting, all other nodes in\nits immediate vicinity must not transmit at the same time,\nassuming that there are no other means of providing isolation\nbetween simultaneous transmissions. Consider a wireless net-\nwork with N nodes and the associated graph G(V,E), where V\nis the set of nodes and E is the set of wireless links connecting\nthe nodes. A virtual wireless link exists between a pair of\nnodes i and j if the distance between them is less than or\nequal to the transmission range of the nodes.\nThe collision domain Cij corresponding to link lij is the\nset of links consisting of lij and all other links that must be\ninactive for collision-free transmissions between nodes i and\nj. The size of a collision domain is directly related to the\ninterference range of wireless nodes. Cij will contain link\nlij and all other links that terminate on nodes within the\ninterference range of either node i or j.\nFigure 1 shows 7 nodes organised in chain topology, con-\nnected via wireless links. Adjacent nodes are assumed to be\njust within the transmission range of each other. Furthermore,\nthe interference range is assumed to be twice the transmission\nrange. Consider link l45 which connects nodes 4 and 5. Other\nlinks that have at least one of their end nodes within the\ninterference range of nodes 4 or 5 must be inactive whilst\nlink l45 is active, as indicated by the dashed arrows in Figure\n1. All the links located inside the dashed region are part of the\ncollision domain of link l45. Similarly, the collision domains of\nother links can be determined by identifying the corresponding\ntransmission constraints. For example, the collision domain of\nl12 consists of l12, l23 and l34.\nThe maximum capacity of each collision domain is limited\nby nominal MAC throughput and hence, there exists a collision\ndomain which creates an upper bound on the network capacity.\nA bottleneck collision domain is defined as the one that needs\nto forward the maximum amount of traffic [7]. It is possible\nthat a network may have more than one bottleneck domain. In\nthe following, we present an analytical framework to determine\nFig. 1. Collision domain\nthe bottleneck collision domain(s) of a WMN which is then\nused to estimate the nominal capacity of the network.\nIII. ANALYTICAL MODEL\nThe model presented in [7] uses nominal MAC throughput\nand the concept of collision domains for estimating capacity\nof wireless mesh networks. The former is defined as the\nthroughput achieved at the MAC layer in a one-hop IEEE\n802.11 network operating in infrastructure mode. It depends on\na number of factors such as MAC layer characteristics, channel\nconditions, network topology and packet size distribution etc\nand can be determined if the relevant parameters are known\n[11].\nConsider a network of N wireless nodes represented by the\ngraph G(V,E) where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of\nlinks between these nodes. Each node is assumed to have p\nradio interfaces and q available channels. An arbitrary channel\nassignment algorithm allocates channels to radio interfaces of\neach network node. One of the network nodes is designated\nas gateway. Furthermore, K out of the remaining N \u2212 1\nnodes generate application traffic with the gateway node as\ndestination. These are referred to as aggregator nodes as they\naggregate traffic from mesh clients and forward it towards\nthe gateway. A routing protocol establishes end-to-end paths\nbetween each traffic generator and the gateway node.\nThe first step is to calculate the expected load on each link\nin the network. Let bi be the rate of traffic generated by node\ni. The expected load on an arbitrary link l in the WMN is\ngiven by\n\u03c6l =\nK\u2211\ni=1\nbi \u2217 \u03bbi,l (1)\nwhere \u03bbi,l is a binary variable whose value is 1 if the traffic\noriginating from node i traverses link l, otherwise it is zero.\nThe next step is to determine all collision domains of\nthe network. In a multi-channel mesh network, the collision\ndomain Cl of a link l consists of that link and all other\nlinks that fall within its interference range and share the\nsame channel. Given the set of collision domains C, Cl is\na bottleneck collision domain if\u2211\ni\u2208Cl\n\u03c6i = max\nCj\u2208C\n\u2211\nk\u2208Cj\n\u03c6k (2)\nWe denote the collision domain as CB . Note that, in general,\nthere may be more than one bottleneck collision domain in\na network. Furthermore, in a homogeneous network, where\nthe available bandwidth of all domains is same, the bottleneck\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 12,2010 at 15:43:35 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \ndomain is the one with the highest expected load. The expected\nload on the bottleneck domain cannot exceed the nominal\nMAC capacity, B. Therefore,\u2211\nj\u2208CB\n\u03c6j \u2264 B (3)\nThe right-hand side of this inequality can be expressed as\nthe weighted sum of the ingress flow rates bi. The exact\nrelationship depends on the routing and channel assignment\nalgorithms. In the analysis that follows, it is assumed that the\nsteady state rate of the flows emanating from the aggregator\nnodes is same. Therefore, Equation 1 can be simplified as\nbelow\n\u03c6l = b \u2217\nK\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi,l (4)\nwhere b is the flow rate of an aggregator node.\nUsing this in Equation 3 yields\nb \u2217\n\u2211\nj\u2208CB\n\u03b1j \u2264 B (5)\nwhere \u03b1j is given by\n\u03b1j =\nK\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi,l\nTherefore,\nb \u2264 B\u2211\nj\u2208CB \u03b1j\n(6)\nHence,\nbmax =\nB\u2211\nj\u2208CB \u03b1j\n(7)\nIt must be noted that this holds true only under the as-\nsumption that absolute fairness is enforced in the network to\nensure that the available bandwidth is equally shared between\nnodes. In [7], this method was validated by simulation and the\nobserved capacity closely matched the theoretical results.\nNote that the assumption of a single gateway is used only\nas a simplification. The same method can be used for multi-\ngateway WMNs as well. The presence of multiple gateways\nwill obviously affect the expected link loads but the procedure\nfor identifying the collision domains remains the same.\nIV. CAPACITY OF GRID-ORIENTED WMNS\nWe used the analytical framework described above to esti-\nmate the nominal capacity of WMNs organised in the form of a\n2-dimensional grid for a wide range of scenarios characterised\nby different grid sizes, number of aggregator nodes, routing\nalgorithms and channel assignment schemes. In the following,\nfirst we describe the scenarios used for the analysis and then\npresent the results.\nFig. 2. Grid WMN Topology\nA. Scenario Synthesis\nNote that the topology of a WMN ultimately depends on\nthe deployment scenario but some features are common. There\nare one or more gateway nodes with connectivity to the global\nInternet via wired links while the remaining nodes are wireless\nrouters or access points (or hybrid nodes that can work as\nboth). Access points act as aggregators of traffic originating\nfrom client nodes attached to them.\nGrid-oriented WMNs have been widely used in literature for\nperformance analysis. Although it is not realistic to assume\nthat grid-based WMNs can be used in all scenarios, it is\nreasonable to expect them to be used, at least, in urban\nenvironments. Note that grids can also be used to generate\nmore random topologies by removing some nodes. Bearing\nthese considerations in mind, the analysis here focusses on\nWMNs organised in grid formation. Furthermore, it is assumed\nthat there is only one gateway node. The topology considered\nfor capacity analysis is shown in Figure 2 where the gateway\nnode is located at the center of the grid and other nodes\nare located at remaining grid points. The aggregators are\ndistributed along the grid boundary and wireless routers can\nbe located at the edges as well as interior grid points.\nThe topology described above has a number of aggregator\nnodes generating traffic with the gateway node as the desti-\nnation. As seen from Figure 2, multiple paths are available\nbetween a given aggregator node and the gateway. These\npaths can be utilised in many ways. One option is multipath\nrouting where all available paths are used simultaneously by\ndistributing the traffic over them. Another multipath routing\nstrategy is to shortlist a few of the available routes based on\nsome suitable criteria and distribute the traffic over this subset\nof paths. A special case is the single path approach in which\nonly one of the available routes is selected and all the traffic is\nforwarded along it. In our analysis, we consider only the single\npath routing algorithm which selects the shortest available path\nfrom a given aggregator node to the gateway.\nChannel assignment is another important aspect of the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Single-radio WMNs can use only one channel even\nif several are available to ensure that the network does not\nbecome partitioned. However, in multi-radio WMNs, it is\npossible to utilise multiple channels simultaneously. In such\nscenarios, channels must be assigned to radio interfaces in\nsuch a way that there is at least one path between every pair\nof nodes to avoid partitioning. Furthermore, the assignment\nmust also take into account performance objectives such as\ninterference reduction, fair distribution of load and throughput\nmaximisation.\nThree different channel assignment schemes are considered.\nThe first is relatively simple where all interfaces are assigned\nthe same channel. This is essentially a baseline case against\nwhich other cases are compared. In the second scheme, the\npartitioning algorithm proposed in [8] is used for uniform\nchannel assignment across the network. Assuming that each\nnode has k interfaces, the algorithm starts by selecting one\nnode and dividing its neighbours into k groups. Each interface\nof the node is assigned a group. In the next iteration, each\nneighbour node is similarly partitioned without violating the\ngrouping established earlier. The process is repeated until all\nthe nodes have executed the procedure. Finally, each group is\nassigned the least-used channel in the neighbourhood. Figure\n3 shows the result of this channel assignment scheme for\na 5 \u00d7 5 grid WMN with k = 2 and 6 available channels.\nNumbers along the lines indicate the channel assigned to\nthe corresponding link. The third scheme assigns channels to\ninterfaces based on the condition that available bandwidth on\nthe interfaces is at least equal to the expected load on the\nassociated links [8]. The scheme uses a greedy load-aware\nalgorithm where channels are assigned to links one-by-one in\nthe decreasing order of expected load. For a given network\ntopology and knowing the amount of traffic generated by\neach aggregator node, the expected load on each link can be\ncalculated from the routing pattern using Equation 1. When\na link is traversed, the channel assigned to it is such that it\nresults in the least amount of interference from other links that\nare in its collision domain. Since links with higher loads are\nvisited first, it is expected that they will be allocated a channel\nthat suffers from less interference and therefore, get a greater\nshare of the available bandwidth.\nThe different aspects described above have been combined\nto generate several scenarios. The following assumptions are\napplicable to all scenarios:\n1) All nodes on the grid are stationary;\n2) Traffic in the network is generated by aggregator nodes\nonly and all other nodes, including wireless routers and\nthe gateway, do not generate any traffic;\n3) Traffic generated by aggregator nodes is destined for the\ngateway;\n4) Interference range is assumed to be 2 hops.\nThe last condition implies that nodes that are within 2 hops\ndistance of a particular node will cause interference to it if one\nor more of their interfaces use the same channel. In addition,\nthe assumptions mentioned in [7] also apply here. In particular,\nFig. 3. Channel assignment based on partitioning\nabsolute fairness is assumed. Furthermore, the MAC layer sup-\nports Request-To-Send\/Clear-To-Send (RTS\/CTS) handshake\nmechanism resulting in symmetric link constraints for collision\ndomain determination.\nB. Results\nThe capacity of WMNs for the scenarios presented above\nwas estimated by implementing the analytical model in MAT-\nLAB. The WMN nodes were assumed to have two radio\ninterfaces. Furthermore, two values were used for the number\nof available channels - 3 and 12. The former corresponds to the\nnumber of non-overlapping channels in IEEE802.11b while\nthe latter is the number of channels available in IEEE802.11a.\nA 5\u00d75 grid is considered here, unless otherwise stated. All the\naggregator nodes in each scenario generate the same amount of\ntraffic. Without loss of generality, the nominal MAC capacity\nis assumed to be 1 and the capacity available to each WMN\nnode is calculated as percentage of the nominal MAC capacity.\nThe capacity is computed for varying number of aggregator\nnodes, which are randomly placed on the grid points located\nalong the boundary. In most cases, there are many ways to\ndistribute a given number of aggregator nodes on a fixed set\nof grid points. Therefore, the analysis considers a large number\nof possible node placements and averages over them.\nThe results presented here show capacity as percentage of\nnominal MAC throughput. Note that each data point is the\naverage over 1000 runs (for the same number of aggregator\nnodes). During each run, a given number of aggregators is\nrandomly placed on the set of available grid points. We use\nthe single channel scenario as the baseline case.\nThe following notation is used in the graphs:\n\u2022 C: Channel assignment scheme (scheme 1 is uniform\nassignment, scheme 2 is partitioning-based assignment\nand scheme 3 is load-aware assignment)\n\u2022 c: Number of available channels\n\u2022 K: Number of aggregator nodes\nFigure 4 shows the nominal capacity of the network when 3\nand 12 channels are available, respectively. The results clearly\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 12,2010 at 15:43:35 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nFig. 4. Capacity vs Traffic Load for Fixed Grid Size\nindicate that the capacity available to each aggregator node\nincreases when multiple channels are used. For the baseline\ncase where only one aggregator is present, the maximum\nthroughput is only around 25% of the nominal MAC capacity\nwhen a single channel is available. In contrast, when multiple\nchannels are used in conjunction with the partitioning-based\nchannels assignment scheme, the capacity is much higher,\nclose to 40% when 3 channels are used and 50% when\n12 channels are available. Furthermore, the load-aware as-\nsignment scheme results in greater gains with the capacity\nexceeding 90% and reaching 100% for 3 and 12 channels\nscenarios respectively. As the number of aggregator nodes\nincreases, the differences between the 3 assignment schemes\ngradually diminish but the general trend stays the same. In\nother words, the channel assignment scheme appears to be an\nimportant factor in determining the capacity. On the whole,\nload-aware channel assignment outperforms the partitioning-\nbased method. The results also show that capacity falls sharply\nas the number of aggregator nodes increases.\nThe next set of results illustrate the effect of grid size on ca-\npacity. In this case, we consider square grids of different sizes\nand compute the capacity for different number of aggregator\nnodes (K). Two different cases are considered. First, we fix K\nand vary the grid size and repeat this for different values of\nK. Next, we fix the aggregator node density and vary the grid\nsize. For an N \u00d7N grid, the maximum number of aggregator\nnodes that can be deployed on the grid edges is 4(N\u22121). The\naggregator density is defined as\n\u03c1 =\nK\n4(N \u2212 1) \u2217 100 (8)\nFigures 5 and 6 show the capacity variation with grid\nsize for these two cases when 3 and 12 channels are used,\nrespectively. We observe that the grid size does not seem to\nFig. 5. Impact of Grid Size and Aggregator Density (c=3)\nFig. 6. Impact of Grid Size and Aggregator Density (c=12)\nhave much effect on capacity when the number of aggrega-\ntor nodes is fixed. In contrast, when we fix the aggregator\ndensity, capacity falls rapidly with grid size before reaching a\nsaturation point.\nC. Discussion\nThe results presented above provide insights on the impact\nof different WMN design parameters on the available capacity\nat each aggregator node. In the following, we discuss some of\nthese implications.\nThere is an inverse relationship between the number of\naggregator nodes and capacity. The main reason for this is the\nincrease in expected load with number of aggregators which\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 12,2010 at 15:43:35 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nmeans that each collision domain has to carry greater load on\nthe average, thereby decreasing the per-node capacity. Even\nfor a given number of aggregator nodes, the capacity depends\non the placement of these nodes with respect to each other.\nIn particular, if aggregators are placed close together, then a\nsmall subset of links will have to carry all the traffic load\nand hence, capacity will be low. On the other hand, when\nseparation between nodes is large, load is distributed more\nevenly in different parts of the grid, thereby resulting in higher\ncapacity. Note that it is possible to provide good separation\nwhen the number of aggregators is small but the same cannot\nbe said for scenarios with large number of aggregators.\nThe location of gateway node with respect to aggregator\nnodes also influences the capacity. As the size of grid in-\ncreases, the average distance between aggregators and the\ngateway also increases. As a result, routes between aggregators\nand gateway traverse through more links and hence, overall\ninterference levels go up. However, increasing the grid size\nalso implies that a given number of aggregator nodes can\nhave greater separation between them which leads to reduced\ninterference. These two effects cancel each other out and\nhence, the results show very small decrease in capacity with\nincreasing grid size when the number of aggregator nodes is\nindependent of grid size. In contrast, when the grid size is\nvaried for while keeping the aggregator density fixed, we see\nthat capacity falls sharply. The reason for this behaviour lies in\nthe effect that the number of aggregator nodes increases when\ngrid size is increased in order to maintain the same density.\nTherefore, the increase in separation between aggregator nodes\nis much smaller and hence the dominant effect is that of long\nroutes sharing many links.\nThe effect of increasing the number of available channels\nis significant when the number of aggregator nodes is not\ntoo high with respect to the available locations on the grid\nboundary. On the average, when the number of aggregator\nnodes is low, increasing the number of channels from 1 to 3\nresults in capacity gain of 10\u221220%, depending on the channel\nassignment schemed used. For the IEEE802.11a case, capacity\nimprovements is in the 10\u221230% range in most cases when the\nnumber of channels is increased from 1 to 12. However, for\nhigh load scenarios, there is very little improvement for multi-\nchannel scenarios. Even though a relatively large number of\nchannels are available, since the number of wireless interfaces\nis just 2, the ability of the network to use all the available\nchannels is limited. The load-aware channel assignment al-\ngorithm performs better compared to the partitioning-based\nmethod, especially when the number of aggregators is low to\nmoderate. However, the gains are limited by the number of\nradio interfaces available. The results, therefore, indicate that\nusing multiple radios in conjunction with load-aware channel\nassignment improves capacity of multi-channel WMNs.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we presented an analytical framework for\ndetermining the nominal capacity of multi-radio multi-channel\nwireless mesh networks. The objective was to study the impact\nof various network design parameters on WMN capacity. The\nnotion of collision domain is used to calculate an upper bound\non the capacity available to ingress nodes that generate traffic\ntowards the node that acts as the WMN gateway to the outside\nworld.\nThe results presented here indicate that the effects of WMN\ndesign parameters are interlinked and a judicious selection\nis essential to maximise capacity. Use of multiple channels\nimproves capacity as neighbouring links can be used simulta-\nneously. However, the reuse factor depends on the number of\nradio interfaces. As a result, when the number of channels is\nincreased from 3 to 12, the resulting capacity gain is not that\nhigh. Furthermore, increasing the number of aggregator nodes\nalso limits the capacity improvement significantly. Grid size\nappears to have little effect on capacity when the number of\naggregator nodes is fixed but capacity falls when the grid size\nis increased while keeping the aggregator node density fixed.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I.
