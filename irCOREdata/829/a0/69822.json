Research illustrates that retrospective self-reports of what people \nhabitually do cannot capture much of the important details of communicative \ninteraction. We argue that video recordings are the best way of doing this, and provide \nexamples from our own work of the type of benefits that can arise. Finally, we set out \na set of guidelines for the use of video recording in reflective practice in services. \n \n \nA manifesto \n 3 \nThe Case \nDespite much flag-waving on the part of social services and NHS trusts in recent \nyears, policy goals which stress the importance of promoting empowerment, \nindependence and inclusion (Department of Health, 2001; HM Government, 2005) \nhave only changed the ways in which services are delivered to a limited degree. \nDespite undoubted improvements in many areas, writers in the field of learning \ndisabilities have noted the multitude of ways in which service structures, routines and \nattitudes stand in the way of empowerment and increasing independence (e.g. Beamer \n& Brookes, 2001; Dowson, 1997; Edge, 2001; Harris, 2003; Jenkinson, 1993; \nJenkinson et al, 1992; Stalker & Harris, 1998). \nWe argue here that there is only so much that can be achieved by re-writing \npolicy documents and vision statements, by changing the type and membership of \nmeetings held in services, by redesigning the filing system, and by sending people to \nworkshops outside of their immediate working environments. None of these expose \nthe staff to an objective record of their own practices. Our basic argument can be \nsimply put: if a staff member is to change their practice, then a good way to \nencourage the self-reflection that must be the first step to that change is to talk them \nthrough a video record of their day-to-day experience with residents (see Purcell, \nMcConkey & Morris, 2000 for this argument in respect to improving staff \ncommunication in services). \n \nWhat video can capture. \nOver the last two years, our research team has conducted an in-depth study of three \nresidential services in the NHS (one health care and two social care), collecting \nethnographic notes and video recordings of what actually goes on from day-to-day in \nA manifesto \n 4 \nthe everyday lives of people with learning disabilities. Our findings, based on these \nnotes and recordings, illustrate that disempowerment and dependence happen in the \nroutine matters of people\u2019s lives. Power is exercised in the way people talk to each \nother, in what is and is not assumed, in what utterances are taken seriously and what \nare ignored, in the routines of residential provision, and in how conversations and \nmeetings are directed, among others (Finlay, Walton & Antaki, in press). Ironically, \nthe recorded data show that even forums which are set up to promote service-user \nempowerment and inclusion can become sites for disempowerment depending on the \nway in which the interactions are structured (Jingree, Finlay & Antaki, 2006; Antaki, \nFinlay, Sheridan, Jingree & Walton, 2006; Antaki, Young & Finlay, 2002). \nThis is not to blame the staff involved; in most cases they act with the best of \nintentions. It is simply that there are routine ways of doing things, and routine \nassumptions by which people operate, which are barely noticed yet which have \nimportant effects on the people whose lives exist within services (for examples, see \nBradshaw, 2001; Markova, 1991; McConkey, Morris & Purcell, 1999; McConkey, \nPurcell & Morris, 1999). The method of analysis we favour, Conversation Analysis  \n(CA), shows us that much of what goes on between people is so rapid and mundane \nthat it goes \u2018under the radar\u2019 (for an account of CA see Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998). \nBut being unnoticed does not mean it is not important \u2013 when we look carefully at \nvideos of life in residential care we can see how power and influence, dependence and \nindependence are woven into people\u2019s talk and interactions with each other. For this \nreason, we believe that only limited results can be achieved through sending people to \nworkshops to learn about and discuss person-centred approaches. Although this \ncertainly help people understand the principles and what they might do to change, it \ncan leave untouched all the behaviours that are so routine they are barely noticed  \nA manifesto \n 5 \nStaff need to see, from a distance and in detail, what they actually do (in their \nown services) when they talk to people with learning disabilities, when they \nencourage (or not) participation, when they try and elicit a person\u2019s preferences, or \nwhen they respond to a complaint or suggestion from a person, for example. Video of \nreal interactions is the medium of choice for this process, and although used in areas \nsuch as family therapy as part of reflective practice, it has surprisingly not made much \nof an impact in improving services for people with learning disabilities (although see \nDobson, Upadhyaya & Stanley, 2002; Embregts, 2002 a & b; Nind & Hewitt, 2001; \nPurcell et al, 2000 for notable exceptions). Given that communication and \nunderstanding is often a central issue, particularly in services for those with severe \nand multiple impairments, video records, set into their ethnographic background, offer \nthe best available way to address what is currently done and how it can be improved; \ncertainly they provide an immediate and detailed way by which people can observe \nand reflect upon their own individual and collective practices.  \n \nExamples \nWe shall provide a few examples from our study of two broad areas in which video \ncan be useful in encouraging change in services:  \n1) Changes in interactional style.  \nStaff can become aware of aspects of their own behaviour that make it \ndifficult for service-users to assert themselves. For example, we found that in an effort \nto check the understanding of the person from whom they were seeking an opinion, \nstaff in one service would habitually rephrase questions several times in quick \nsuccession before an answer had been given. This made it difficult for the resident \nsince they could not be sure which question they were supposed to be answering; \nA manifesto \n 6 \noften this led to no response being given. In other cases, we found that staff would \noften check the answers that residents gave, by repeating or subtly rephrasing the \noriginal question. Again, members of staff did this to make sure that the answer given \nby the resident really reflected their (the residents\u2019) needs or wishes. Unfortunately, \nthis was often taken by the resident to indicate that their original answer was not \nacceptable, and they would then offer a different answer, further compounding staff \nuncertainty about what that individual really wanted.  Another problem identified was \nstaff eliciting views using questioning styles that encouraged residents to state their \nsatisfaction rather than to voice their dissatisfaction or complaints (eg Everything ok? \nAre you happy?).  \nFor residents who had limited verbal communication, watching the video \nrevealed the use of subtle or slightly mistimed gestures and signs, understandable as \nexpressions of preference, which routinely passed unnoticed by members of staff. A \nfinal example involved service-user meetings. Although set up as a forums within \nwhich people could speak for themselves, recordings showed staff facilitators \nengaging in a range of practices that determined who could speak at any particular \ntime, what topics were appropriate for discussion and the decisions that were made. \nAlthough meetings are useful \u2018evidence\u2019 for inspectors that a home promotes \nempowerment, it was clear that other forums might be better for some residents to \nexpress their preferences.  \n2) Changes in service structure and routine.  \nVideo records can also highlight how more general service routines and \npractice might change to provide more opportunities for resident participation and \nchoice. When staff talked about why they did what they did on the videos, we found \nthat they often held beliefs about what they were and were not allowed to do (based \nA manifesto \n 7 \non ideas about health and safety guidelines, policy, rules or inspection requirements) \nthat turned out to be wrong. For example, having viewed a routine monthly episode in \nwhich residents were weighed, as a check on their general health, and during which \nseveral residents made clear their resistance to being weighed in the face of repeated \nattempts by staff to persuade them, the staff group involved decided that monthly \nweighing for all residents was actually not necessary. In one home in which staff \nroutinely made drinks for the residents, viewing a recording in which a staff member \nsuccessfully supported the residents in making their own drinks showed other \nmembers of staff that, with assistance, the residents could do it themselves and that \ntheir fears over health and safety were unjustified. This video also revealed how the \nlayout of the kitchen and the store cupboard were obstacles to the residents\u2019 \nparticipation, and possible future independence, and a number of changes were agreed \nupon. Finally, in the same home, a video of one man preparing food showed that, \nalthough he failed to do a particular task several times in a row (putting sprinkles on a \npudding), with encouragement and support he was finally able to do it himself. \nBecause he was not thought capable, other staff would normally not give him the \nopportunity to participate in cooking. \n \nGuidelines \nUsing videos in staff development and service improvement has the potential to make \nreal differences to services, and can add a useful tool to the armoury of those \nresponsible for quality assurance in health and social care services. It is a very \nrevealing way of carrying out a critical reflection on one\u2019s practice. \nHowever, delicate preparation and strict procedures need to be followed to \nprotect people\u2019s rights and dignity, and to ensure staff do not reject the process. The \nA manifesto \n 8 \ngeneral procedure would involve a single service, for example a group home or an \nassessment centre (we shall use the example of residential services here). There are \nvarious possibilities for leading the process: it could be done with an independent \nfacilitator, in conjunction with a self-advocacy group, or as a group-directed activity \ninvolving a small staff and client group. If it is to become a routine part of practice, \nthe latter needs to become the model. Although the process could be led by a service \nmanager, this might introduce other agendas, concerns and obligations into \ndiscussions which would interfere with the process. If a manager is involved, they \nwould have to be extremely sensitive, non-judgemental, and have the trust of the other \npeople involved in the process.  \nCareful attention needs to be paid to the issue of consent, both for the people \nliving in the service and the staff who are likely to be involved. The procedures used \nfor inviting people to participate in the recordings should be as rigorous as those for \nparticipation in a research project. This should include detailed and understandable \ninformation as to the uses of the recordings, and clear explanations about the ability of \npeople to decline and to withdraw at any stage without the fear of negative \nconsequences. With the appropriate consents in place, recordings would be made of a \nnumber of routine episodes (e.g. residents\u2019 meetings where staff are present; teaching \nsessions; menu planning; food preparation and choice; negotiation over outings, \nparties, house maintenance; discussions with residents around their preferences for \nactivities, holidays etc). Once these are collected, some episodes would be identified \nwhich appeared to go well (in terms of respecting residents\u2019 preferences, encouraging \nindependence etc) and some episodes which were problematic. The selection of the \nepisodes would very much depend on the agenda of the service and the staff group. A \nworkshop would then be held in which these episodes would be viewed and \nA manifesto \n 9 \ndiscussed. It is important that each clip is viewed more than once, with a discussion \nafter each viewing, since the nature of interaction is such that new aspects usually \nbecome apparent only on repeated inspection of the recordings (Dobson et al, 2002). \nThe procedure would therefore be: first viewing \u2013 discussion \u2013 second viewing \u2013 \ndiscussion \u2013 until the group felt it was time to move to the next clip. We have found \nthat as long as there is a \u2018no blame\u2019 policy to the workshops, staff find this an \ninteresting and engaging process, and people often see things they did not know they \ndid (\u2018Do I really do that?\u2019). Suggestions for how things might be done differently can \neasily be generated in such contexts, and indeed the meetings should end by \nenumerating the changes that the service and individual workers might make to \npromote choice and independence. \nA number of safe-guards need to be put in place before video work can be \ndone:  \n1) An initial meeting should be held with staff and those living in the service where it \nis decided what and who shall be videoed. Since staff may be reluctant to be recorded, \nmanagers and senior staff could set an example by volunteering themselves in the first \ncase. There should be no compulsion or pressure over who is recorded, and there \nshould be no consequences for people who do not wish it. \n2) Strict consent and confidentiality guidelines should be followed. Videos should not \nbe passed on to management and should not be used for evaluation purposes. At the \nend of the session, unless the members of staff involved agree to retain and use the \nvideos again, all tapes should be deleted in front of the participants. \n3) People with learning disabilities who appear in the video should be consulted \nseriously and carefully about whether they wish to be filmed, and all ethical and \nconfidentiality procedures followed. In situations in which people are unable to give \nA manifesto \n 10 \nconsent themselves, the procedures for participation on the basis of assent should be \nfollowed. In these deliberations, it should be remembered that this video work should \nlead to direct benefits for service-users. Again, there should be no compulsion to \nparticipate. \n4) Managers and supervisors should approach the viewing sessions carefully. If staff \nare criticized for what they do on tape, discussions will break down and others will \nnot agree to be filmed. Except for cases of abusive practice, a \u2018no blame\u2019 approach \nshould be taken at all times. Here it is useful to remember that staff have to fulfil a \nnumber of service agendas which often conflict (e.g. health and safety versus choice) \nand they operate within structures and routines which appear set in stone (even if they \nare often not). Many interactions in residential services involve a difficult balancing \nact regarding the interests and expectations of different stake-holders (management, \ndifferent residents, other workers, families), conflicting agendas of care, and \ncommunication difficulties between staff and service-users. As such, individuals \nshould be assured that when they find situations difficult others do also, and it is not \nthem but the situation which is the focus of the discussion. \n5) Workshops should focus equally on what works well as where problems arise. That \nis, clips selected should include good practice as well as difficulties. Members of staff \noften hold the solutions to problems or have ideas of how things could be done \ndifferently. New ways of doing things and new opportunities for the residents can be \nidentified and agreed upon on the basis of seeing one staff member do something that \nothers don\u2019t do, either because they believe it can\u2019t work or that there are obstacles to \ndoing it. \n \nConclusion \nA manifesto \n 11 \nThis is a manifesto for the use of video as a way of promoting person-centred \napproaches in residential care. It is based on the observation that much \ndisempowerment occurs in the mundane, barely noticed details of life in services, and \nthat staff can only engage fully with this by watching what they and their co-workers \ndo from a distance. Following the arguments of Purcell et al (2000), we believe that \nservices will only become truly person-centred when this level of attention is paid to \nthe details of interaction between staff and people with learning disabilities. Given \nthat many interactions between staff and people with learning difficulties proceed on \nthe basis of unequal institutional power and differences in communicative abilities \nand understanding, it is surprising that this is not already standard practice. Video is \nroutinely used in other areas in which interactional details are crucial such as family \ntherapy, and it should be used in services for people with learning disabilities as a \ncentral tool of reflective practice. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe research reported here was facilitated by grant number Res-148-25-0002 from the \nUnited Kingdom ESRC.
