The use of Internet discussion boards are one way that people living with long-term conditions can interact with their peers and offer and seek advice, support and information. We report patient perspectives on using a discussion board within a wider pilot study of an Internet-based self-management system for diabetes.\\ud\n\\ud\nDesign: Qualitative data was gathered during three stages of developing and piloting the wider self-management system. These are: (1) patient focus groups as part of a stakeholder consultation; (2) a pre-test session and focus group; and 3. a 6-month pilot study including follow-up individual interviews.\\ud\n\\ud\nResults: Three main themes were identified within participants\u2019 perspectives on Internet discussion boards. First, a focus on the importance and value of peer support to these patients.
