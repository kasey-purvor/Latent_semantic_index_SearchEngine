Luminescence measurements\nand cross-sectional transmission-electron-microscopy images from devices fabricated by boron\nimplantation into crystalline silicon, and into a pre-amorphized substrate, to prevent the\nboron-induced loops formation, were compared. The results show that, in the devices incorporating\ndislocation loops between the depletion region and sample surface \u0001the boron induced loops\u0002, the\nthermal quenching has been completely eliminated, in contrast with devices fabricated from the\npre-amorphized substrate where strong thermal quenching is still observed. \u00a9 2005 American\nInstitute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2130533\u0004Silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor and is fun-\ndamentally unable to emit light efficiently. Nevertheless, sili-\ncon is the basis of the microelectronic industry and several\napproaches have been considered to enhance its poor light\nemission. These include porous silicon,1 silicon-silicon diox-\nide superlattices,2 silicon nanoprecipitates in silicon dioxide,3\nerbium in silicon,4 silicon\/germanium,5 and iron disilicide.6\nA common problem found in all these approaches is the\nstrong thermal quenching leading to very poor performance\nat room temperature. Ng et al.7 proposed a unique solution,\nthe dislocation engineering method, to suppress the thermal\nquenching in semiconductor systems. The basis of the dislo-\ncation engineered approach is the controlled introduction, in\na p-n junction between the depletion region and the surface,\nof dislocation loops. The loops modify the silicon band gap,\non the p-side, to provide spatial confinement of charge car-\nriers. Thus, diffusion of injected carriers to point defects and\nthe surface, where efficient nonradiative recombination oc-\ncurs, is minimized or eliminated. This approach was used,\nfor example, to fabricate \u0001-FeSi2 light emitting devices\n\u0001LEDs\u00028 and reduced the luminescence thermal quenching to\nonly one order of magnitude of that of the low temperature\nemission, making these devices much more efficient then\nconventional ones, where room temperature luminescence\nwas practically absent.\nIn this paper we present a detailed study of the role of\nthe dislocation loops on the suppression of the luminescence\nthermal quenching. In order to directly compare the lumines-\ncence of devices with and without the incorporation of dis-\nlocation loops above the p-n junction, two batches of\nsamples were designed. Devices were fabricated by boron\nimplantation \u00011015 B cm\u22122 at 30 keV\u0002 into either a standard\n\u0003100\u0004 n-type silicon substrate, phosphorous doped\n\u00012\u20137 \u0002 cm\u0002 or on an otherwise identical substrate but pre-\nviously amorphized by a high energy silicon implantation\n\u00016\u00031015 Si cm\u22122 at 400 keV\u0002. Thus, boron induced disloca-\ntion loops were formed above the junction in the crystalline\nsubstrate, but not in the pre-amorphized material. In both\na\u0002Electronic mail: m.lourenco@surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2005\/87\u000220\u0001\/201105\/3\/$22.50 87, 20110\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tocases, the boron implantation provided the p-type dopant to\nform the p-n junction. Subsequent to the boron implantation,\nall samples were annealed at 950 \u00b0C for 20 min in N2 am-\nbient. Fabrication of light emitting devices, in both cases,\nwas completed by deposition of front and back contacts and\nmesa etching, as described previously.8 Devices fabricated\nfrom the substrate containing the dislocation loops will be\nreferred to as dislocation engineered light emitting diodes\n\u0001DELEDs\u0002 and the ones fabricated from the pre-amorphized\nmaterial will be referred to as conventional devices. The\ndevices were characterized by electroluminescence \u0001EL\u0002,\nphotoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002, and cross-sectional transmission\nelectron microscopy \u0001X-TEM\u0002. The EL and PL experiments\nwere performed in the temperature range 80\u2013300 K, as de-\nscribed in Ref. 9. PL measurements were done at 100 mW\nusing the 488 nm line of an Ar laser. EL measurements were\nperformed under forward bias \u0001current density of 3 A\/cm\u22122\u0002\nextracting the light through a window at the back of the\nsamples. Current-voltage characteristics were measured prior\nto the EL experiments and, in both cases, showed good diode\ncharacteristics, with a turn-on voltage of less than 1 V. The\nbasic procedure for the XTEM measurements is described in\nRef. 10.\nCross-sectional TEM analysis after boron implantation\nand annealing is presented in Fig. 1. It shows that boron\ninduced dislocation loops are present only in samples fabri-\ncated from the crystalline substrate; implantation of boron in\npre-amorphized substrate does not induce the formation of\ndislocation loops. Figure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows the X-TEM image of\nsamples fabricated from the crystalline substrate. It can be\nseen that dislocation loops are located at a depth of\n\u0005140 nm, above the depletion region edge at \u0005350 nm.\nThis is in agreement with the predicted ion range \u00011091 \u00c5\u0002\nand straggle \u0001394 \u00c5\u0002 for 30 keV B implantation into Si.11\nThese loops are extrinsic, either faulted or perfect, lying in\n\u0006111\u0007 Si habit planes as described earlier.10 Figure 1\u0001b\u0002\nshows X-TEM image taken from samples fabricated from\nthe pre-amorphized substrate. In this case only end of range\n\u0001EOR\u0002 dislocation loops with respect to Si ion range are\npresent.

Figure 3 shows the EL mea-\nsured at 80 K and at 300 K for both types of devices. The EL\nresponse for the dislocation engineered LED is dominated, at\nlow temperatures, by a strong, narrow line peaked at 1.1 \u0004m,\ncorresponding to the Si band-edge emission. Emission at\n1.1 \u0004m is practically absent in the conventional device at\n80 K, its EL response being dominated by a broad line in the\nregion 1.3\u20131.7 \u0004m. At room temperature, EL at the silicon\nband edge is observed from both devices. However, the\nDELEDs are ten times brighter than the conventional de-\nvices. Figure 4 shows the EL integrated intensity plotted\nagainst measurement temperature for a DELED and a con-\nventional device. The EL integrated intensity increases with\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject totemperature for the DELED, and decreases for the conven-\ntional device.\nThe increase of EL integrated intensity with temperature\nobserved only in the dislocation engineered light emitting\ndiodes clearly shows that the incorporation of boron induced\ndislocation loops between the device active region and sur-\nface is responsible for the elimination of the luminescence\nthermal quenching. The dislocation loop array introduces a\nstrain field outside the loop that increases the silicon band\ngap by up to 0.75 eV7 and enables spatial confinement of the\ninjected carries, so carrier diffusion to point defects and the\nsurface, where efficient non-radiative recombination occurs,\nis suppressed. Dislocation loops above the junction were not\nformed by boron implantation into the pre-amorphized\nsubstrate. Indeed, only Si induced end-of-range dislocations,\nlocated much deeper in the substrate, could be observed, so\nFIG. 3.

Phys. Lett. 87, 201105 \u00022005\u0001spatial confinement of charge carriers to prevent nonradiative\nrecombination was absent. These end of range dislocations\nare probably the origin of the EL emissions observed at\n80 K. These lines, at 0.82, 0.86, and 0.92 eV, are the D1, D2,\nand D3 lines, commonly reported to appear in ion implanted\nsilicon.12 They are also thought to be related to the small\nincrement in the silicon integrated intensity with temperature\nobserved in the pre-amorphized devices. In this situation, the\nsilicon emission is fed from the emission from the D lines.\nIndeed, an increase in silicon band edge emission due to a\nsimultaneous decrease in other centers has been observed\nand successfully modelled before.8\nThe external quantum efficiencies collected, just through\nthe windows, of the devices into a hemisphere are 0.02% for\nthe dislocation engineered LED and 0.002% for the conven-\ntional silicon LED. It should be noted that, because these are\nplanar devices, the measured total external quantum effi-\nciency is limited by total internal reflection that reduces the\nextraction efficiency through the front surface by a factor of\n\u000560 of the total EL produced internally. This effect is simply\nthe result of geometric optics and could be largely eliminated\nby commercial LED packaging or by surface texturing, as in\nthe case of the silicon diode reported by Green et al.,13 where\nan external quantum efficiency of \u00051% in high purity silicon\ndevices was reported. In general, the quantum efficiency in a\nLED is a function of injection current14 because competing\nnonradiative routes, in particular Schockley-Hall-Reed\n\u0001SHR\u0002 recombination, through bulk and surface defects at\nlow injection currents, and Auger recombination at very high\ninjection. The EL of the dislocation engineered devices re-\nported here is found to be linear up to the maximum current\ndensities measured of 15 A\/cm2. This is consistent for a low\nto medium injection regime where, as postulated here,\nrecombination through defects \u0001the SHR route\u0002 have been\ndecoupled from the radiative route and before the onset of\nsignificant Auger recombination.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated here that the con-\ntrolled introduction of dislocation loops, to allow their loca-\ntion, mean size and density to be engineered, is responsible\nfor the suppression of the luminescence thermal quenching\npreviously observed in silicon-based light emitting diodes.\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject toDislocation engineered light emitting diodes are efficient at\nroom temperature and generally brighter than at lower tem-\nperatures. In contrast, thermal quenching is strong in devices\nfabricated without the introduction of dislocation loops into\nthe active region of the device. It is the stress field intro-\nduced by the array of dislocation loops that creates a block-\ning potential that, when placed adjacent to and just above the\ndepletion region edge, prevents carrier diffusion to point de-\nfects and surface, where efficient nonradiative recombination\noccurs, so radiative recombination is enhanced. Thus, by\ndecoupling the nonradiative recombination routes, the\nluminescence thermal quenching can be suppressed or elimi-\nnated, as band-to-band transitions are relatively temperature\nindependent, in contrast to nonradiative routes which show\nstrong temperature dependence.\n1K.
