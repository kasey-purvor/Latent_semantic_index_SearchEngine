The subsequent application of political economy ideas undoubtedly revived interest in \nagricultural research. This paper argues that agricultural geography contains greater diversity than \nthe dominant political economy discourse would suggest. It reviews \u2018other\u2019 areas of agricultural \nresearch on policy, post-productivism, people, culture and animals, presenting future suggestions \nfor research. They should ensure that agricultural research continues revitalized rather than \nredundant into the next millennium. \n \n \nThe redefinition of agricultural geography \nIt is ten years since Bowler and Ilbery (1987) attempted to reinvigorate research into agricultural \nchange through a \u2018redefinition\u2019 of agricultural geography in Area. Drawing upon earlier ideas \nabout the political economy of agriculture expressed by Marsden et al. (1986) Bowler and Ilbery \n(1987)\u2019s framework was an attempt to ensure that research into agriculture did not become a \nredundant area of academic attention. The cause of their concern at this point in time was that \nresearch topics examined by agricultural geographers concentrated on regional changes in farm \ninputs, farm-size structures, farm incomes and agricultural marketing. According to Bowler and \nIlbery (1987, 327), these showed \u2018every signs of diminishing returns\u2019 and were attracting \u2018a \ndeclining number of researchers in all countries\u2019. Atkins (1988, 281), in a comment on this \narticle, went further by stating that agricultural geography had lost its way in an \noverconcentration on \u2018production functions and tedious typologies\u2019, emphasizing that food rather \nthan farming should be central to research. A \u2018theoretical impasse\u2019 had become associated with \nsuch work, further explaining the timing of Bowler and Ilbery\u2019s (1987) paper. The emergence of \nnew theoretical ideas in human geography offered potential relevance to explanations of changes \nin the agricultural sector. Indeed, they argued that \u2018There is now a need for agricultural \ngeography to extend its theoretical base to encompass the structuralist perspectives of political \neconomy\u2019 (Bowler and Ilbery, 1987, 329). Support for this dimension was forthcoming from \nMarsden (1988) who provided a more detailed critique of the \u2018problems and possibilities\u2019 of \nincorporating political economy perspectives into agricultural geography. An additional stimulus \nto Bowler and Ilbery\u2019s research agenda was that agriculture itself had entered a phase of policy \nuncertainty after a long period of stability. In the mid-1980s, the prevailing productivist ethos \nbased on increasing food output was challenged by a political crisis consisting of interelated \nbudgetary, production and environmental problems. This severely disrupted the traditional \ncontext for agricultural geography, but simultaneously opened up new avenues for research. \nBowler and Ilbery (1987) suggested that research into agriculture be reorganised around three \ncentral components. First, the \u2018food chain\u2019 was advocated as sufficient in scope to provide an \n\u2018integrating conceptual framework\u2019 and a convenient way to explore the linkages between \nagricultural production and urban and industrial food systems. Secondly, from this platform, an \nextended theoretical base using political economy ideas could be developed. Thirdly, this in turn \nwould provide a broader empirical content to agricultural research. It was hoped that such a \n 3 \nredefinition would \u2018re-establish a coherence currently lacking in research work and teaching\u2019 \n(Bowler and Ilbery, 1987, 330).  \n \nAn important observation about Bowler and Ilbery\u2019s proposed framework was that political \neconomy approaches were not introduced specifically to preserve institutionally-defined sub-\nareas such as agricultural geography. Instead, it was predicted that a \u2018blurring\u2019 of the boundaries \nof study would occur (Marsden, 1988). Political economy approaches attempted to provide better \nexplanations of agricultural change and in so doing they demanded \u2018an interdisciplinary effort \nwhereby the boundaries of sub-disciplines are progressively weakened\u2019 (Marsden, 1988, 320). \nThis led researchers to look beyond the farm gate to understand the agricultural sector, leading \nsubsequently to interaction with other disciplines and geographical sub-fields and extending the \nrange of topics studied. This is illustrated clearly in the analysis of an increasingly globalised \nfood system (McMichael, 1993; Whatmore, 1995; Le Heron and Roche, 1995, Marsden and \nArce, 1995; Goodman and Watts, 1997). A profusion of research on agricultural issues adopting \nthis approach has been forthcoming, ensuring a revitalization rather than a redundancy of \nacademic interest, although little further debate has taken place about the nature of agricultural \ngeography itself. However, political economy has become the dominant discourse to the extent \nthat, for many, it has come to represent agricultural geography. This is reinforced in a host of \nrecent reviews which equate explicitly the development of political economy ideas with \nagricultural geography (see Short, 1996; Whatmore et al., 1996; Marsden et al., 1996; Marsden, \n1998a). An irony is that in this way political economy could be viewed as providing coherence in \nagricultural geography through a clearly defined theoretical position, as behaviouralist work and \nmodels of economic rent did before it, contributing to a reinforcement of the identify of \nagricultural geography as a distinct sub-field of inquiry. \n \nThe significance of the contribution of a political economy thesis in agriculture is unquestioned. \nFurther, in its modified form it has increasingly striven to capture some appreciation of the \n\u2018diversity of social relations and cultural practices shaping accumulation and regulation\u2019 \n(Marsden et al., 1996, 362).  However, consistently approaching an analysis of agricultural \nchange from one theoretical position has tended to eclipse the rich variety of work on agricultural \nchange existing alongside that adopting a political economy perspective. Consequently, work \nwhich makes no direct claim to be developing political economy ideas tends to fall beyond the \nremit of reviews of political economy which have dominated \u2018progress\u2019 reports on agricultural \nresearch (for a recent illustration, see Marsden, 1998a). Instead, it adopts a range of conceptual \npositions and it is this variety in research that offers strength and vitality to the study of agrarian \nissues. It also reflects a general shift within human geography away from the search for a single \ntheoretical position and towards a diversity of narratives on research topics. Hence, one purpose \nof this paper is to review progress in this area of \u2018other\u2019 agricultural work and so give a voice to a \nrange of discourses which provide different perspectives on agriculture to that of political \neconomy. It may reasonably be expected that such perspectives would be included by those \nreviewing the considerable new dynamism to be found within rural geography. However, \nagricultural issues have received scant specific attention in these cases (see Cloke, 1997; \nHalfacree, 1997; Phillips, 1998). It is the intention here to capture some of the vibrancy and \nbreadth of agricultural work and to highlight possible new research \u2018excitements\u2019 in agriculture \nto add to those made by Cloke (1997) in the rural realm. Both new research topics and new \n 4 \nconceptual approaches to these topics are suggested, drawing upon relationships with the new \ntheoretical advances made in rural geography, specific agricultural policy-led work, empirical \nanalysis of farming trends, and wider engagement with human geography and related disciplines. \nThe nature of the discussion, as Phillips (1998) recently acknowledges in a review of rural social \ngeography, reflects the authors\u2019 own trajectory in academic study. One outcome of this is that \nattention is confined to agriculture in developed market economies and specific examples are \nprimarily taken from the UK literature. \n \n\u2018Other\u2019 agricultural research \nUsing specific examples, this section seeks to demonstrate that research into agricultural change \nis far from redundant and that future prospects for academic work are bright. This can be \nrevealed through a discussion of \u2018other\u2019 agricultural research which simultaneously reports on \nprogress and illuminates further possibilities for research. Given the many opportunities that \npresent themselves and limitations of space, selectivity is necessary so that the subsequent \ndiscussion is organised around three sub-headings. These are based upon volume of research \ninterest generated, issues that have been highlighted but have yet to be fully explored, and those \npresenting novel and interesting research possibilities. First, a greatly neglected area in progress \nreviews is the considerable quantity of work undertaken on the evolution of agricultural policy. \nSecondly, an important element deriving from policy shifts has been the recent engagement of \nresearchers with the concept of a \u2018post-productivist transition\u2019, a specific issue which is worthy \nof closer attention. Thirdly, a broad group of concerns offer refreshing perspectives on \nagricultural change for geographers, comprising continued development of issues surrounding \npeople working in the agricultural sector and new ways of thinking about \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018animals\u2019 \nemanating from elsewhere in human geography. \n \nThe evolution of agrarian policy \nThere is little doubt that there have been significant changes in agricultural policy since the mid-\n1980s. Previously, there was a relative paucity of policy-oriented work within agricultural \ngeography, that of Bowler (1979) being a major exception. This represented a rare spatial \nanalysis of the adoption of specific policy measures by farmers (such as the hill cow subsidy and \nploughing grant) and drew upon insights from a behavioural perspective. However, it is the scale \nof recent changes in agricultural policy that have stimulated a new genre of policy-related \nresearch. Work has been of two main kinds. First, research has taken a macro-policy view, \ninvestigating the nature and form of state intervention in agriculture, the implications of this \nintervention for the environment, and how national \/ European Union (EU) policy making has \nincreasingly been shaped by international events and processes particularly GATT and WTO1 \n(Bowers and Cheshire, 1983; Cox et al. 1986; Lowe et al., 1986; Bowler, 1989; Winter, 1996; \nPotter, 1998; Potter and Goodwin, 1998; Marsden, 1998a). Secondly, developments in agri-\nenvironmental policy (AEP) have come to represent a particularly important focus for those \ninterested in policy analysis. Here, research has critically examined the design of the agri-\nenvironmental policies themselves (Potter, 1988; Baldock et al., 1990), but increasingly attention \nhas been given to the implementation of these initiatives with the neatly defined spatial \nboundaries of many AEP schemes providing a convenient analytical focus. A significant tranche \nof studies has examined the impact of AEP on farmers, largely through investigation of the \nadoption process of individual agri-environmental schemes (Brotherton, 1991; McHenry, 1994; \n 5 \nWhitby, 1994; Morris and Potter, 1995; Battershill and Gilg, 1996; Wilson, 1996; Morris and \nYoung, 1997). Many of these build upon a behavioural tradition in agricultural geography by \nfocusing on the decision-making processes of farmers. Although not always theoretically overt, \nthe applied and policy-oriented work on agricultural and agri-environmental policy has made \nimportant conceptual and empirical contributions to agricultural geography alongside those of \npolitical economy, a fact which tends be overlooked in reviews of the latter. It has made a direct \ncontribution to the development of agri-environmental initiatives by informing policy makers \nabout the effectiveness of specific policy measures. Of wider significance than this, it has \nelucidated the processes by which farmers take on board environmental considerations. \n \nIt is evident that this work has made a positive contribution to the geography of agriculture, but \nthree particular dissatisfactions can be observed. First, some agri-environmental schemes have \nreceived more research effort than others. This can be explained in part by the differential \nattention and financing given to individual schemes by government, especially as some schemes \nhave been accorded a higher political profile than others (Evans and Morris, 1997). Also, there \nare difficulties associated with gaining access to schemes and their participants that do not have \nspatially delimited boundaries (Evans, 1997). Consideration of those schemes which have \nreceived less research effort would therefore be valuable. For example, there have yet to be \nreports of the agri-environmental aspects of Objective 5b funded schemes, so this is a possible \nfuture development. Secondly, although it is important to appreciate local differences, \nhighlighted by case study work such as that on specific Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs), \nthis approach to agri-environmental research has meant that different areas of environmental \nvalue have been considered largely in isolation from broader objectives of biodiversity, \nsustainability and future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. One cause of this problem \nis that some case study work on AEP has been derived from the monitoring and evaluation of \nindividual agri-environmental schemes undertaken for state departments (Whitby, 1994). This \nhas been critical of specific policy elements but weaker on fundamentally challenging this form \nof support for the environment. For example, Skerratt (1994) admits that work based on the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\u2019s (MAFF) evaluation of ESAs permitted only a \nparticular view of ESA participants and their experience of participation. A lack of critical \nanalysis can be viewed in the context of Murdoch and Ward\u2019s (1997) concept of \ngovernmentality. Rather than being lead by agricultural departments who are trying to implement \npolicy, it would appear more pertinent to explore how the state has constructed agricultural and \nagri-environmental policy to regulate the sector. This has been clearly revealed in a discourse \nanalysis of the 1992 agri-environment regulation adopted by J. Clark et al. (1997). Thirdly, \nalthough work on agri-environmental policy formulation by the state and its implementation at \nthe farm level has progressed, there has been surprisingly little exploration of the way in which \nAEP is mediated. As Wilson (1997) suggests, clear possibilities exist for integrating actor \nnetwork analyses into studies of AEP, helping to reveal something about the regulatory nature of \nthe agencies involved (Cooper, 1998). \n \nAgricultural policy changes will undoubtedly continue to inspire research into the effects of \npolicy, particularly those initiatives which attempt to stimulate voluntarily \u2018greener\u2019 behaviour \namongst members of the farming community (Morris and Potter, 1995). However, taking the \nwider view will also continue to be crucial, especially as the policy structures of the CAP come \n 6 \nunder further pressure from economic and other policy pressures both external and internal to the \nEU (Marsden, 1998a). \n \nThe \u2018Post-productivist Transition\u2019 \nThe changes in agricultural policy discussed above have increasingly been conceptualised as \n\u2018post-productivism\u2019. The notion of a post-productive transition (PPT) emerged in the early 1990s \nto capture the change in agrarian priorities (primarily of the EU\u2019s CAP) away from food \nproduction towards meeting broader rural development and environmental objectives (Lowe et \nal., 1993; Bowler and Ilbery, 1993; Ward, 1993). The PPT should be a key development for \ngeographers engaged in agricultural research, yet it possesses a curious dual role as a descriptor \nof work already undertaken and a focus for further analysis. More specifically, it can be argued \nthat work on the PPT comprises three chronological research components. First, post-\nproductivism was initially used to summarize aspects of agricultural adjustment which had \npreviously and variously been conceptualised as 'survival and accumulation strategies', 'elements \nof farm adjustment' and 'farm business development paths' (see Marsden et al., 1989; Munton, \n1990; Bowler, 1992 respectively). It represented a convenient way to acknowledge the \ndifferential responses made by farm households at the point of production to new conditions in \nthe farm sector. Secondly, there has been a brief phase attempting to establish the characteristics \nof the PPT. According to Ilbery and Evans (1996), the remaining characteristics of the PPT \nencompasses: a shift in emphasis away from quantity towards quality in food production (Morris \nand Young, 1998; Marsden, 1998b); the growth of alternative farm enterprises, conceptualised as \n'pluriactivity' (Ilbery, 1991; Evans and Ilbery, 1993); state efforts to encourage a return to more \ntraditional, sustainable farming systems through agri-environmental policy (Wilson, 1996; Ilbery \net al. 1997); the growing environmental regulation of agriculture (Robinson, 1991; Ward et al., \n1995); and the progressive withdrawal of support for agriculture (Winter, 1996), this latter \ncharacteristic being predominantly relegated to a contextual position within agri-environmental \nresearch. Thirdly, the PPT has most recently become the subject of process-oriented theorization. \nIlbery and Bowler (1998) view the PPT as a simple reversal of previous productivist components \nof change which emphasize extensification rather than intensification, dispersion rather than \nconcentration and diversification rather than specialization. Such developments bring with them \nnew regulatory conditions which again presents opportunities to utilise theoretical advances \nmade in rural geography (for example, see G. Clark et al., 1997). \n \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the piecemeal amalgam of conceptual and empirical work represented by \nthe PPT has failed to generate more searching questions. For example, there has been little debate \nabout the usefulness of a conceptual division between \u2018productivism\u2019 and \u2018post-productivism\u2019 to \nsummarize complex processes of agricultural change. Insights from work in rural geography (and \nelsewhere in the discipline) on \u2018Fordism\u2019 and \u2018post-Fordism\u2019 could be used to inform an \nevaluation of post-productivism (Cloke and Goodwin, 1992; Goodwin and Painter, 1996). In this \ncase, it could be argued that the post-productivist transition is more appropriately viewed as \nencompassing a number of changes which accompany a predominantly productivist agriculture \nrather than a wholesale shift in the sector. Notions of structured coherence, as suggested by \nCloke and Goodwin (1992, 326-327), may characterize the post-productivist transition as a \n\u2018whole series of movements between the differing practices and procedures of various strategies \nof regulation operating at overlapping scales\u2019. This would aid analysis of a new \u2018mode of \n 7 \nregulation\u2019 in agriculture, as Goodwin and Painter (1996) have suggested for industrial \norganization and local governance in preference to a post-Fordist model, and move research \nbeyond descriptive cataloguing of these changes as simply fitting a \u2018post-productivist model\u2019. \nSuch an approach may help to overcome the unsatisfactory impression that 'post-productivism' \nrepresents the end of a productivist philosophy in agriculture when this is clearly not the case. \nEvidence shows that despite the reorientation of agricultural policy away from uni-dimensional \nfood production, for most farmers it is \u2018business as usual\u2019 in meeting food output goals (Winter, \n1997). Two diagnostic components of post-productivism, namely pluriactivity and agri-\nenvironmental policy, both impact significantly only on a small number farming businesses, \nwhilst environmental regulation (another component) remains a minor inconvenience in day-to-\nday farming practice. For example, in the late 1980s boom-time of on-farm diversification, only \nan estimated 6% of farms had accommodation enterprises (the most popular type), and just a \nfraction generated significant income (see Evans and Ilbery, 1989 and 1992). Similarly, Potter \nand Goodwin (1998) demonstrate that current spending on agri-environmental policy is less than \n4% of the agricultural budget. Further, many of these diagnostic activities are not new to the \nagricultural sector, with major enterprises such as farm-based accommodation being found as far \nback as the 19th Century (Bouquet, 1985). This is not to deny that the scale, number and variety \nof non-food productive activities has increased on farms since the mid-1980s, but to question \nwhether an emphasis on these conditions is sufficient to represent a \u2018transition\u2019. A potentially \ninteresting debate about a \u2018post-productivist myth\u2019 has yet to establish itself in the literature. \n \nPeople, culture and animals \nThe previous two sections have acknowledged the significant policy changes that have occurred \nin the agricultural sector and started to explore the way people respond to such shifts. However, \nimportant in \u2018other\u2019 agricultural research has been the specific focus on people in agriculture, and \nit is to this area of inquiry that the discussion now turns. It was in the 1970s that behavioural \nperspectives introduced the importance of individual farmers as decision-makers and established \na strong agency orientation within agricultural research (Ilbery, 1985). The emphasis was \npredominantly on the process by which male farmers made economic decisions about \u2018their\u2019 farm \nbusiness, divorced from external influences (those beyond the farm gate). Further, little \nconsideration was given to the way farmers lived their lives in a broader sense, interacting with \nother people in the farm household. Political economy perspectives, which rejected the \nbehavioural tradition, drew attention away from individual agents and the choices made within \ntheir decision-making processes towards the structures which constrain these choices. \nConceptualised in the very different terms of modified political economy, agency was present but \nnot central to analyses of agricultural change. For example, agency was incorporated into \ninvestigations of the \u2018strategies\u2019 that individual farm households were adopting to cope with \nfalling farm incomes and changing policy, investigated empirically through farm interviews \n(Marsden et al., 1987; Marsden et al., 1989; Evans and Ilbery, 1992). Thus, the impact of \npolitical economy was to assist agricultural geographers in considering the \u2018people\u2019 of farm \nfamilies and households, rather than the farmer alone, broadening the scope of analysis. \n \nOne developing thread of research on agricultural people has been the contribution of farm \nwomen to the farm business. An informal identification of farm women\u2019s worlds was achieved in \nthe rural \u2018community studies\u2019 genre of research (Frankenburg, 1966; Harper, 1989). Although \n 8 \nthese studies provided sketches of the contribution of women to the functioning of farms, women \nwere not central to these descriptions of rural life. The first detailed focus on women in \nagriculture was attempted by Gasson (1980) who identified a range of role types for women in \nfarming. Building on this approach, Gasson then provided descriptive accounts of the farm wife\u2019s \ncontribution to the farm household (Gasson, 1989). As the importance of the farm household in \nagriculture was more generally realised, research started to incorporate insights from work on \ngender relations emerging in mainstream human geography (Whatmore, 1991; Berlan-Darqu\u00e9 \nand Gasson, 1991). Farm women were investigated as one factor explaining the survival of the \nfamily farm in capitalist conditions as part of a reconstituted political economy in which gender \nrelations were placed centre stage (Whatmore, 1991 and 1993). This was taken further through \nrecognition of the farm family as a diverse unit of capital-labour relations within which actions \nand decisions derive from imbalances of power between farm men and women (Whatmore, \n1991). Feminist perspectives were introduced to focus upon this relationship and its \nconsequences for farm life. Despite this interest, specific theories of gender relations remain to \nbe fully exploited in agricultural geography and considerable scope for feminist work within \nanalyses of agricultural change exists. For example, it should be possible to conduct analyses of \nwomen farmers (independent of males) and those women directly inheriting farms in comparison \nwith those marrying into farming, or to examine mainstream agricultural issues (such as the BSE \ncrisis, the new emphasis on conservation in farming, farming suicides) from the farm women\u2019s \nperspective. Ironically, changes in agricultural policy have had the dual and contradictory effect \nof diverting attention away from farm women and helping to refocus research on this group. For \nexample, agri-environmental policy work has built on the behavioural tradition in that there is a \nresearch emphasis on the attitudes of the individual, typically male, \u2018farmer\u2019 and his decision-\nmaking in the business, and less on other farm household members. In contrast, the pluriactivity \nwork has served to widen the focus of attention on other farm household members, including the \ncontribution of farm women (Evans and Ilbery, 1996). \n \nWork on individuals in agricultural research has not been at the expense of that maintaining a \nmore collective focus. Important in this latter respect has been an observable shift in some \nanalyses away from individual people and towards \u2018agri-cultures\u2019 as the \u2018cultural turn\u2019 has \nimpacted upon rural geography. For example, a modified political economy perspective has \nfound \u2018closer affinities with those concerned with the material and cultural geographies of food \nand nature\u2019 (Whatmore et al., 1996, 55). Some of this work has engaged with Dutch rural \nsociology on endogenous rural development and \u2018local knowledge systems\u2019 (see Long, 1989; van \nder Ploeg, 1990 and 1992; Murdoch and Clark, 1994), but has not fully considered these as \ncultural phenomena. In this latter case, a starting point would be to recognise that farmers are \nbearers of locally specific knowledge actively shaping the policy context, rather than simply \nreceivers of information from policy-makers as is commonly assumed. Such an important \nconceptual development is one that is yet to be fully exploited in agricultural research (Winter, \n1997).  \n \nThe insights from cultural perspectives have yet to impact fully on agricultural geography. \nRather, a continued evolution of a behaviourally grounded approach in a post-structuralist \ncontext can be identified strongly in the main research avenues of pluriactivity and agri-\nenvironmental policy (see Bateman and Ray, 1994; Morris and Potter, 1995; Wilson, 1996). In \n 9 \nsome ways, it is understandable that work has not been more culturally sensitive because much of \nit has been delivered within a \u2018policy evaluation\u2019 mould. The monitoring brief demanded by \ngovernment agencies leads inevitably to questionnaire type approaches to inform their policy \nadjustments, focusing on the \u2018principal\u2019 decision-maker. Despite these limitations, the use of \nculturally sensitive perspectives has begun to have an impact (McEachern, 1992; McHenry, \n1994; Clark, 1994; Young et al., 1995; Morris and Andrews, 1997; Walsh, 1997). This is partly \nbecause the AEP shift has an inherent cultural dimension, as exemplified by the ESA approach, \nthe government\u2019s flagship AEP (Baldock et al., 1990). These are targeted on specific \ngeographical areas and are sensitive to some of the idiosyncrasies of farming practice founded on \nlocal tradition.  \n \nAlthough work has been largely policy-led, there are possibilities for research to commence with \ncultural constructions of farmers. For example, analyses could begin with well-known \nconstructions of farmers as \u2018guardians\u2019 from the 1942 Scott Report (Ilbery, 1992), as keepers of a \n\u2018pastoral myth\u2019 (Short, 1991), as \u2018thieves\u2019 of the countryside (Shoard, 1980), or now as \u2018others\u2019 \namongst largely non-farming rural populations (Yarwood and Evans, 1998). Alternatively, a de-\ncoding of the meanings of \u2018farmer\u2019 could be undertaken on how this group create and interpret \nunderstandings of political, social and economic issues, building on the ethnographic approach \nadopted by Pile (1991) and McEachern (1992). They respectively investigated the political world \nin which farmers operate and the role of \u2018conservationist\u2019 that a farmer is expected to fulfill. \nNevertheless, there has been little debate whether research should start with farming or farmers \nas cultural constructions, so avoiding a return to a behavioural-type modelling of attitudes and \ndecision-making, or would be better to add in cultural dimensions as an ingredient. Evidence of \nboth approaches can be observed in agriculturally-related work, but not in the explicit way that \nthe exchange of views in rural geography between Philo (1993) and Murdoch and Pratt (1993) \nabout post-modernism and \u2018post-rurality\u2019 might suggest. \n \nThe limited impact of the cultural turn in analyses of agricultural change is somewhat surprising \ngiven the extent to which rural geography has engaged with cultural geography. This is illustrated \nby Cloke\u2019s (1997) review of the influence of the cultural turn in social science for rural studies. \nCultural geographies are identified as inspiring a \u2018fizz\u2019 of interest in \u2018the rural\u2019, but this is yet to \npermeate \u2018the agricultural\u2019. Hence, a \u2018culturally sensitive\u2019 agricultural geography offers new \nconceptual and methodological perspectives on old isses and suggests new topics for inquiry. In \nshort, farmers are still a valuable focus for analysis, but this needs to be complemented by wider \nviews of farming in society. Drawing upon the observations made above, three areas of inquiry \nimmediately present themselves. \n \n1. Greater attention should be paid to cultural constructions of different groups within the \nfarming \u2018community\u2019, which is all too frequently assumed to be homogenous by investigations of \nnon-farming people in rural locales. Certain agricultural groups continue to be neglected despite \nsome recognition within earlier research work, such as farm workers, tenant farmers and women \nin farming (Newby, 1979; Whatmore, 1991). The value of considering \u2018others\u2019 is already \napparent in rural geography, as illustrated by work on new age travellers (Halfacree, 1996) and \npeople of colour (Kinsman, 1995). Further, actor network thinking has stimulated research on the \nlinks between farmers and other people, such as agricultural advisors, inspectors and company \n 10 \nsales representatives, which is deserving of more emphasis (Murdoch and Marsden, 1995; Lowe \net al., 1997). \n \n2. Drawing on the work of Short (1991) and Bunce (1994), more work could be attempted on \ndifferent constructions of farming as an activity, on farmers themselves, and of the places in \nwhich farming occurs. A more detailed exploration of the agrarian hyperrealities that are so \nevident in on-farm recreational pluriactivity is one area worthy of attention in this context. \nExtending this type of analysis beyond the farm gate to consider images and constructions of \nfood would also be worthwhile (Bell and Valentine, 1997). This approach demands the use of a \nvariety of different media including literary texts and images, film, academic \/ polemical writing, \nthe national press, policy documents and promotional materials (Cook and Crang, 1996; Mather, \n1998; Young and Morris, 1998). Further, constructions of agriculture by groups of countryside \nusers (as opposed to countryside dwellers), such as those of ramblers and mountain-bikers, are \nrelatively unexplored. \n \n3. The geographies of animals has special relevance to agricultural geographers. Astonishingly, \nanimals have almost by \u2018tradition\u2019 been ignored. It can be interpreted as a consequence of \nhuman-centredness derived from a sharp dualism in society and nature relations (Murdoch, \n1997). Animals are therefore seen as homogenous items of mass production, broad types within \npolicy mechanisms or at best as supplying \u2018quality products\u2019 within the food production system \n(Yarwood et al., 1998). Little has been written on the association of animals with local folklore \nand culture, so that a discourse is lacking on the importance of particular animals to particular \nlocales, and to the constructions of these locales. For example, there has been some recognition \nof the association of sheep with the English Lake District (see Higgins, 1993), but more detailed \nexplorations of the significance breeds of sheep have not been attempted. Only recently has work \nbegun to appreciate the distinctiveness of different breeds of farm livestock in the cultural \nlandscape (Evans and Yarwood, 1995; Yarwood and Evans, 1998). Work which pays greater \nrecognition to the agency of animals, even within an agriculturally domesticated situation is \npossible (such as the geography of sheep hefts and hefting). Similarly, Philo\u2019s (1995) work on \nexclusion and inclusion offers interesting insights into the microgeography of farming units. \nAnimals were formerly located within farmers\u2019 domestic spaces, becoming excluded to adjacent \nbarns over time and in turn increasingly relocated to farmyards from which the residential \nfunction has been removed under the influence of farm amalgamation processes. \n \n \nA future for agricultural research \nGiven the political gravity of agrarian questions and their distinctiveness within \u2018the rural\u2019, \nagriculture should continue to provide a meaningful starting point for debates and research into \nthe next millennium. Identification with agriculture as a starting point for geographical \ninvestigations can assist an exploration of changes in the sector itself and in related economic, \nsocial, cultural and political activities, as agro-food studies are now acknowledging (Goodman \nand Watts, 1997). Having established the continued value of an agricultural focus for research, it \nis evident that since the appearance of Bowler and Ilbery\u2019s (1987) paper, the geography of \nagricultural change has been dominated by a political economy discourse. That a political \neconomy approach has been of enormous value to inform and revitalize agricultural research is \n 11 \nunquestionable. However, there has been little recent acknowledgement of the value of diversity \napparent within agricultural research, apart from reiterations that political economy, as applied in \na modified form to agriculture, has sought to accommodate such diversity. This can be viewed as \nrather disappointing, especially given the discussions that have taken place in rural geography \nwhich have propagated a substantial body of new research (Philo, 1993; Murdoch and Pratt, \n1993; Cloke, 1997; Phillips, 1998). Clearly, there is a multi-dimensional research agenda in \nagriculture and so it is difficult to identify one unifying conceptual framework as envisaged by \nBowler and Ilbery (1987) or Marsden (1988). It is the range of possible conceptual and empirical \npositions that allow researchers to appreciate the complexity of old and new agrarian issues \npreventing any future notion of redundancy in agricultural research. \n \n \nNotes \n1 GATT refers to the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade; WTO is the World Trade \nOrganization \n \nReferences \nAtkins, P.
