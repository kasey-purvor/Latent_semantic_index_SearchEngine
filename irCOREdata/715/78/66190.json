Method: Touch behaviour and content of child-directed speech were analysed for 72 mothers and \ntheir infants during  pleasurable play. Eighteen infants of mothers with depressed mood, and 18 controls were \nseen when they were 6 months old; and eighteen infants of mothers with depressed mood, and 18 controls \nwere seen when they were 10 months old. Results: Depressed mothers in comparison with non-depressed \nmothers lifted their infants more, restraining their behaviours. Infants of depressed mothers in contrast to \ninfants of non-depressed mothers spent greater periods of time in touching self rather than mother or toy, \ncompensating for the lack of positive touch from their mothers. Mothers with depressed mood of 6-month-old \ninfants included fewer affective and informative features in their speech than their controls. Non-depressed \nmothers of younger babies, showed a higher use of affective features when compared with non-depressed \nmothers of older infants. In contrast, depressed mothers of 6-and 10-month-old babies showed similar \nfrequencies of affect-salient speech during the interactions in spite of their infants\u2019 changing developmental \ndemands. Limitations: Mothers in this study were only mildly depressed, as assessed by the Edinburgh \nPostnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Nevertheless, the findings indicate that mothers with depressive \nsymptoms differ from non-depressed mothers in relation to touch and content of speech when interacting with \ntheir infants. Conclusions: These results suggest that postnatal depression may influence touch behaviour as \nwell as the affective and informative content of maternal speech. The effect is that mothers with depressed \nmood in comparison with non-depressed mothers touch their infants more negatively and their speech is less \nwell adjusted concerning the amount of emotional versus information related content thereby preventing \ndepressed mothers from responding effectively to their infants\u2019 developmental needs. \n \n           Key words: depressed mood, touch, maternal child-directed speech, infant emotional response \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 3\nIntroduction \nInfants\u2019 ability to respond effectively to the environment develops in the context of an interactive relationship \nwith their mothers (Brazelton, Koslowski & Main, 1974). Mother-infant interactions imply a process of \nsynchronous and bi-directional influence, where skills are transmitted, which promote learning experiences \n(Kaye, 1982). The quality of these interactions varies depending on mothers\u2019 emotional state.  \n \nPostnatal depression has been associated with reduced quality of mother-child interaction and increased risk of \nbehavioural disturbance, and impaired cognitive, social and emotional development in their offspring (e.g., \nSinclair & Murray, 1998; Murray, 1991; Hay & Kumar, 1995; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, \n1999; Pickens & Field, 1993; Kumar, Hipwell & Lawson, 1994). However, some researchers argue that maternal \ntouch can compensate for the lack of verbal and facial emotional communication by depressed mothers with their \ninfants (Pelaez-Nogueras, Field, Hossain, & Pickens, 1996). \n \nAlthough the systematic study of maternal and infant touch has been widely neglected (Malphurs, Raag, Field, \nPickens,& Pelaez-Nogueras, 1996; Pelaez-Nogueras et al., 1996; Hertenstein & Campos, 2001; Hertenstein, \n2002), recent research on tactile stimulation demonstrates that maternal touch is an important means of \ncommunication during early social exchanges. Touch elicits positive affect, reduces negative affect, and modifies \noverall responsiveness in infants as early as 3 months of age (Stack & Muir, 1990, 1992; Pelaez-Nogueras et al., \n1996; Stack & Arnold, 1998). According to Hertenstein (2002), through touch, mothers and infants can exchange \nperceptions, thoughts and feelings, which promote emotional and non-emotional or informative communication.  \n \nDifferent qualities of touch relate not only to the context of touching, but also to characteristics of the mother \n(Hertenstein, 2002). Depressed mothers might interact with their infants in an intrusive, controlling and over-\nstimulating manner, or in a withdrawn, passive and under stimulating way (Malphurs, Raag, Field, Pickens, & \nPelaez-Nogueras, 1996; Field, Healy, Goldstein & Guthertz, 1990; Cohn, Matias, Tronick, Connell, & Lyons-\nRuth, 1986). Postnatally depressed mothers in comparison with non-depressed mothers touch their infants in a \nmore negative manner (rough pulling, tickling, poking), and with different frequency (Lyons-Ruth, Zoll, \nConnell,&  Grunebaum, 1986; Malphurs et al., 1996; Fergus, Smith & Pickens, 1998). Since touch between \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 4\nmother and child is bi-directional, similar to verbal communication, it implies that both partners are active \nperformers (Kaye, 1982; Hertenstein, 2002). Hence not only depressed mothers but also their infants vary their \ntouch behaviour. Specifically, infants of depressed mothers in comparison with infants of non-depressed mothers, \nspend more time touching their own skin (Hentel, Beebe & Jaffe, 2000). In summary, touch within mother-infant \nrelationship is a bi-directional, communicative, dynamic process, which is subject to contextual factors, \nindividual differences, as well as developmental changes (Hertenstein, 2002).  \n \nMaternal child-directed speech promotes closeness between a mother and her baby, and encourages early \nlanguage learning in the infant (Kaye, 1982; Bloom, Margulis, Tinker & Fujita, 1996). One function of maternal \nspeech is to convey the intent of social interaction focused on describing and discovering the environment \n(Bornstein et al., 1992). However, both form and function of maternal child directed speech are affected by the \nemotional state of the mother (Murray, Kempton, Woolgar & Hooper, 1993; Zlochower & Cohn, 1996; Kaplan, \nBachorowski & Zarlengo-Strouse, 1999). The speech of non-depressed mothers is characterised by short \nutterances, repetition, high rates of imperatives and interrogatives, few directives and controlling statements or \ncorrections, and is focused on the children\u2019s experience (Murray & Trevarthen, 1986; Snow, 1977). In contrast, \nspeech of depressed mothers is focused on the mother\u2019s own experience, contains a high percentage of negative \naffect, spare use of explanations, suggestions and questions, as well relatively few acknowledgements of infant \nagency (Cox, Puckering, Pound & Mills, 1987; Murray, et al, 1993). Several studies have shown that children of \ndepressed mothers in comparison with children of non-depressed mothers have more difficulties in expressive \nlanguage, perform poorly on measures of cognitive-linguistic functioning and are less co-operative at 36 months \n(e.g. Cox et al., 1987; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1999). As a result, it has been suggested that \nchild-directed language may mediate the association between depression and infant cognitive development in the \nfirst 18 months (Murray et al, 1993).  \n \nIt has also been reported that the type of child-directed speech is affected by age and developmental level of \ninfants (e.g., Sherrod, Friedman, Crawley, Drake & Devieux, 1977; Phillips, 1973). Normally, mothers shift from \ntalk about their infants\u2019 internal states and feelings to talk about their activities and external environment over the \nchild's first year of life  (Snow, 1977; Penman et al., 1983, Bornstein et al., 1992). The content of maternal \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 5\nspeech in terms of whether it is affect-salient or information-salient has been used to evaluate the child-directed \nspeech of non-depressed mothers (e.g., Penman, Cross, Milgrom-Friedman & Meares, 1983; Sherrod, Crawly, \nPetersen & Bennett, 1978; Broerse & Elias, 1994; Bornstein, Tal, Rahn, Galperin, Lamour, Ogino, Pecheux, \nToda, Azuma & Tamis-LeMonda, 1992).  However, it is unclear what effect depressed mood has on the \nfunctional content of speech in the postnatal period. \n \nTronick & Gianino (1986) explain the dynamics of early mother-infant interactions in general, and the effect of \npostnatal depression in particular, in terms of the \u201cMutual Regulation Model\u201d (MRM). According to this model, \ninfants in their first year of life regulate their internal emotional states and their relationship with the external \nenvironment through a \u201cregulation\u201d process. When facing internal and external disturbing states, infants use \n\u201cself-directed\u201d regulatory behaviours (forms of self-comfort such as sucking, rocking, touching), and \u201cother-\ndirected\u201d regulatory behaviours (emotional displays such as smiles, crying) to modify the sources disrupting their \nemotional state. Self-regulatory behaviours are controlled by infants, and reduce their engagement with the \nenvironment, which are translated into withdrawal and avoidance of social exchanges. In contrast, other-regulated \nbehaviours include an evaluation of maternal behaviour perceived by the infants, and maintenance of their \nengagement with the environment. According to the MRM, when mothers respond accurately to their infants\u2019 \nother-regulated behaviours, infants are able to maintain both self-regulation and regulation of the interactions \nwith the environment. \n \nSelf-directed and other-directed behaviours are expressed emotionally in the face, speech, voice, gesture, and \nposture.  During the first year of life, these various channels are not well coordinated and infants, in order to face \nall disruptions, require an additional regulatory capacity, which has to be provided by their mothers. Mothers \nhave to read and respond to their infants\u2019 behaviours accurately in order for this system to work well. However, if \nmothers are depressed, they are not able to respond contingently to their infants\u2019 behaviours. This results in \nnegative emotional states, which infants have to resolve by the use self-regulatory behaviours. This process then \nproduces poorly coordinated interactions. In contrast, well regulated states translate into synchronous and \naccurate behavioural exchanges between mothers and their infants (Tronick & Gianino,1986). Additionally, \nFogel (1988) suggested that not only the frequency of dyadic events, but also the content of the behavioural \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 6\nevents are important variables of face-to-face interactions. Therefore, frequency of touch and quality of touch \n(direct, indirect, self-touch, lifting), as well as content of maternal child-directed speech (affect- and \ninformational-salient) are considered for analysis in the present study.  \n \nIn the present study, differences in behavioural patterns of touch and the functional content of maternal speech \n(affect- and informational-salient style) were examined in relation to maternal mood and infants\u2019 age during a \npleasure-eliciting situation. Postnatal depression may arise at a few days, weeks, or months after childbirth, \nlasting for many months if untreated, thereby influencing maternal interactions with the infants during the first \nyear (Cooper, Campbell, Day, Kennerly & Bond, 1988; Cox, Murray & Chapman, 1993). Furthermore, the \ncontent of maternal child directed speech is affected by the age and developmental stage of infants (e.g. Phillips, \n1973; Snow 1977; Penman et al., 1983; Bornstein et al., 1992). In order to observe possible cross sectional \ndifferences in mothers with and without depressed mood and their infants, touch and content of speech were \nanalysed in mothers with babies falling into two age groups, namely 6-and 10-months.  \n \nGiven previous findings on postnatal depression, touch and maternal child-directed speech (e.g. Cohn et al., \n1986; Field et al., 1990; Murray et al.,1993; Malphurs et al., 1996; Hentel et al., 2000), the following hypotheses \nwere tested: First, mothers of 6-and 10-month-old infants, with depressed mood, in comparison with non-\ndepressed mothers, differ in the quality and frequency of their touch of their infants. Based on findings in the \nliterature of the lack of responsiveness and withdrawn behaviours (e.g. Stein, Gath, Bucher, Bond, Day &Cooper, \n1991; Murray, Fiori-Cowley & Hooper, 1996) it was expected that depressed mothers in comparison with non-\ndepressed mothers would touch their infants less frequently. Second it was expected that non-depressed mothers \nof 6-month-old babies would use more frequently affect-salient speech than non-depressed mothers of 10-month-\nold infants, whereas depressed mothers of both age groups were expected to use less affect-salient speech than \ncontrols.  It was expected that non-depressed mothers would use more frequently information-salient speech than \ndepressed mothers.   Third, infants of depressed mothers differ from their controls by showing more self-touching \nbehaviours and less other-directed touch. \n \n \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 7\nMethod \nParticipants \nSeventy-two mother-infant dyads, recruited from The Birth Register of Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, participated \nin the study. There were 18 infants (11 boys and 7 girls) of mothers with depressed mood and 18 controls \nobserved when they were 6 months old; and a further 18 infants (11 boys and 7 girls) of mothers with depressed \nmood and 18 controls observed when they were 10 months old. All infants were healthy, of normal birth weight, \nand had no history of medical complications. In this sample, 52% of the mothers were primiparous, with a mean \nof 29.5 years old (R=18-41 years old). All mothers were Caucasian, living in the Grampian area of Scotland in \nthe United Kingdom. They had a mean of 13 years of education,(range10 -19 years).    \n \nThe 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Cox, Holden & Sagovsky, 1987) was used to assess \nthe current state of maternal depressed mood. Initially, Cox et al. (1987) reported for the scale a sensitivity of \n86%, a specificity of 78%, and a positive predictive value of 73%. Later, Murray & Carothers (1990), found a \nlower sensitivity of 67,7%. In another study (Harris, Huckle, Thomas, Johns & Fung, 1989), the EPDS proved to \nbe more sensitive (95% versus 68%) and specific (93% versus 88%) than the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, \nWard, Mendelson, Mock & Erbaugh, 1961). Total scores on the EPDS range from 0 to 30. A cut-off 9\/10 was \nconsidered to identify depressed mood (Cox, Murray & Chapman, 1993; Cox & Holden, 1994). For this reason, \nmothers who scored 9 and above were classified as suffering from depressed mood, and mothers who scored 0-8 \nwere classified as non-depressed mothers. The EPDS ratings of depressed mothers with 6-month-old babies were \nmean =10.77; and of depressed mothers with 10-month-old babies were mean = 14.22 (range 9-23).  The EPDS \nratings of controls with 6-month-old babies were mean = 3.66; and of controls with 10-month-old babies were \nmean = 4.94 (range 0-8). \n \nProcedure \nObservational sessions, lasting 5 minutes took place in the homes of participants, at optimal times when babies \nwere awake and alert, usually after having been fed (Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda, 1990). In this sample, 50% of \nthe babies were observed in the morning and 50% in the afternoon. Only the observer, the mother and baby were \npresent during the interaction. Infants were placed in a \u201cbaby seat\u201d and their mothers sat in front of them \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 8\napproximately 18 inches away. Two cameras with directional microphones were used; each one was set \napproximately one metre from the mother and the child, in order to record their faces and upper torso during face-\nto-face interaction. Mothers were invited to play with their infants as usual using a soft toy (a zebra beany baby) \nin order to elicit pleasure. This pleasure-eliciting situation was chosen because it represents an opportunity in \nwhich mothers with and without depressed mood interact and play with their infants within the context of an \nemotional communication (Reissland,et al.2002).  \n \nCoding \nTouch \nFrequency of touch was coded during the entire interaction for the number of times that any physical contact (on \nclothes or skin) occurred between either mother and infant, towards each other or towards the toy, (e.g., Stack & \nMuir, 1992; Stack & Arnold, 1998). Mean frequency of touch was defined as the total number of touch \nbehaviours, divided by the total time in minutes of the interaction. The types or quality of touch coded for both \nmothers and infants, were either direct (using the hands and touching part of the body), or indirect (using the toy). \nMaternal lifting (using hands and arms to hold the toy or baby up) and infants\u2019 self-touching behaviour were also \ncoded. \n \nInfants\u2019 vocalisations \nInfants\u2019 vocalisations were coded in terms of relative frequency (incidents per minute) of occurence, and were \ndefined as any utterance or sound accompanied by positive, or neutral affect, without considering physiological \nsounds such as burps, cries, sneezes or hiccups (Stack & Arnold, 1998; Reissland & Stephenson, 1999). Infants\u2019 \nbehavioural states were coded in terms of vocally active, and vocally inactive (neutral) (Malphurs et al., 1996).  \n \nMaternal Speech \nFrequency of maternal speech to their babies was coded and analysed based on the function of each utterance \nclassified as: (a) affect-salient (feeling-oriented)- expressive, generally non-propositional, idiomatic or \nmeaningless statements with an affective function, expressed as laughing, greeting, encouragement, recitation, \nonomatopoeia, discouragement, mimicking and endearment; and (b) information-salient (object-oriented)-direct \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 9\nstatements, interpretations, questions and reports about the infant, mother, or environment. These categories are \nmutually exclusive (see Table 1). The coding unit was defined as an utterance with a single functional category, \nand the unit changed when there was a change in coded utterance type or when an utterance terminated and a \nsilence of at least 2 s followed. Therefore, a minimum unit size could be a single word or the sound of a letter, for \nexample, hi, a, aha, e or goo (Penman et al., 1983; Bornstein et al., 1992).  \n \nReliability \nMaternal and infant\u2019s touch and vocalisations were coded frame-by-frame using the Observer System (1995). An \nindependent observer, blind to mothers\u2019 group status coded 15. 27% of the sample (11mother-infant pairs). The \nmean percentage of agreement ranged from 92.1% to 98.84% (kappa coefficient = 0.93) for infants\u2019 measures, \nand from 81.45% to 97.83% (kappa coefficient = 0.83) for maternal touch. The percentage of agreement for \nfunctional content of maternal speech ranged from 77.19% to 98.41% (kappa coefficient = 0.78). \n \nResults \nMeans and standard deviations of infant and maternal measures are shown in Table 2. \nMaternal touch \nMothers of 6-and 10-month-old infants, with depressed mood, in comparison with non-depressed mothers, \ndiffered in the quality and frequency of touch directed to their infants. In relation to direct touch, there were no \nmain effects for age or depression, but a significant interaction was observed (F (1,68) = 12.41; p < .001; \u03b7p2= \n.154). Depressed mothers of 10-month-old infants touched their babies directly more frequently than their \ncontrols and depressed mothers of 6-month-olds. Control mothers of 10-month-old infants, did not differ from \nnon-depressed mothers of 6-month-olds.  Analysis of variance on indirect touch showed no main effects for age \nor depression, but a significant interaction was found (F (1,68) = 4.17; p < .045; \u03b7p2= .058), although none of the \ncomparisons using Tukey HSD were significant.   \n \nAnalysis of variance was performed on frequency of maternal lifting with age of infants and psychological state \nof the mother as factors. A main effect was found for infants\u2019 age (mean for 6 month- olds = 0.18 mean for 10 \nmonths olds=0.77; F(1,68) = 9.86; p < .002; \u03b7p2= .127). A significant interaction was observed between maternal \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 10\nmood and infants\u2019 age on mothers lifting their infants (F(1,68) = 4.43; p < .039 \u03b7p2= .061). Maternal lifting \npatterns appear to change according to the age of the infants. Depressed mothers of 10-months-old babies lifted \ntheir infants more frequently when compared with their controls and depressed mothers of 6-month-old babies.  \n \nMaternal Speech: \nThe content of speech of mothers with and without depressed mood differed. Statistical analyses were performed \non mean frequency of maternal vocalisations using ANOVA, where the factors were age of infants (young, old) \nand mood state of mothers (depressed, non-depressed). In relation to affect-salient speech, there were no main \neffects, but a significant interaction was found between age of infants and mood state of the mothers (F(1,68) = \n12.08; p < .001; \u03b7p2= .151). Pairwise comparisons (Tukey HSD) showed that non-depressed mothers of 6-month-\nold infants included more affective features in their speech, than the depressed mothers of 6-months-olds. Non-\ndepressed mothers of 10-months-old-infants in comparison with depressed mothers of 10-month-old infants did \nnot differ (see Table 2), but the control mothers of 10-months olds use less affective salient speech than non-\ndepressed mothers of 6-months-olds. As predicted (Hypothesis 2), the frequency of maternal-affect salient speech \nvaries significantly among mothers without depressed mood in relation to the age of their infants; in the case of \ndepressed mothers it remains constant. \n \nAnalysis of variance for information-salient speech with depressed mood and age groups as factors showed no \nmain effects, but a significant interaction between age of the infants and maternal mood state (F (1,68) = 3.99; p \n< .050; \u03b7p2= .055). Contrary to prediction (Hypothesis 2), depressed mothers of 6-month old infants, in \ncomparison with control mothers, included fewer informative features in their speech. However, depressed \nmothers of 10-month-old infants included as many informational features as their controls when interacting with \ntheir babies.   \n \nInfant  Behaviours  \nInfants of depressed mothers differed from their controls by showing more direct and indirect self-touching \nbehaviours. Analysis of variance was performed on mean frequency of infants\u2019 direct and indirect self-touching \nbehaviour, considering as factors the age of infants (6 and 10 months old) and maternal mood state (depressed \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 11\nand non-depressed). A significant main effect was found for depression in relation to direct self-touching, mean \nfor children of depressed mothers = 8.6, mean for controls= 4.48 (F (1,68) = 9.48; p < .003; \u03b7p2= .094). A \nsignificant main effect was found for depression in relation to indirect self-touching, mean for children of \ndepressed mothers = 4.76, mean for controls= 1.93 (F (1,68) = 10.23; p < .002; \u03b7p2= .131). There were no main \neffects for age and no interaction in both cases. As predicted (Hypothesis 3), infants of mothers with depressed \nmood touched part of their own body either directly or indirectly, more frequently compared with infants of non-\ndepressed mothers in both age groups. There were no significant differences in relation to infants touching their \nmothers either directly or indirectly, or in the amount of vocalisations expressed by them when interacting with \ntheir mothers in both age groups. Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations for maternal and infants\u2019 \nbehaviours in both age groups. \n \nMeasures of Associations between EPDS scores, speech and touch variables \nIn order to determine the relationships between the EPDS scores, the two styles of maternal speech (affect-and \ninformation-salient), and touch behaviours for each group of age, a Pearson correlation analysis was conducted.  \n \nResults for the 6-month-old group, indicated that EPDS scores were negatively associated with the use of \naffective (r = -.329; n=36; p<. 050), and informational (r = -.504; n=36; p<. 002) elements in maternal speech; \nand also with the frequency of mothers touching their infants directly (r = -.409; n=36; p<. 013). In other words, \nthe more depressed the mothers, the less they included affective and informational features in their speech, and \nthe less they touched their infants directly. Additionally, frequency of affect-salient speech was negatively related \nto the frequency infants touched indirectly their own bodies (r = -.397; n =36; p<. 016), but positively associated \nwith the frequency of their mothers touching them indirectly (r = .422; n =36; p < .010). Mothers who used \naffect-salient speech more frequently touched their infants more frequently, and their babies less often touched \nthemselves indirectly. Finally, positive associations were found between EPDS scores and the frequencies with \nwhich infants touched themselves directly (r= .570; n=36; p<.000). \n \nFor the 10-month-old group, there were several positive associations. EPDS scores were positively associated \nwith the frequency that babies touched themselves indirectly (r = .375; n=36; p< .024), and with the use of \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 12\naffective features in the maternal speech (r = .430; n=36; p< .009). Specifically, the use of discourages, as an \nelement of the affect-salient category, was positively associated with both the amount of time that mothers lifted \ntheir babies (r = .401; n=36; p< .015), and also with the time that babies spent indirectly touching their own body \n(r =. 453; n=36; p<. 006). \n  \nThese combined findings suggest that differences in the style of maternal speech observed in each age group, are \nsignificantly associated with the degree of depressed mood, affecting not only the quality of maternal touch, but \nalso babies\u2019 touch behaviour, as well as general responsiveness during mother-infant interaction. \n  \nDiscussion \nIn summary, this study found important differences between depressed and non-depressed mothers, and  between \ntheir infants, when addressing touch and speech styles in relation to infants\u2019 age during a pleasure-eliciting \nsituation. \n \nPrevious studies have reported that mothers who are clinically depressed tend to show negative affect (anger, \nsadness), negative touch (rough pulling, tickling, poking), as well as unresponsive behaviour during face-to-face \ninteractions with their infants (Cohn, Matias, Tronick, Connell & Lyons-Ruth, 1986; Field, 1986; Field, Healy, \nGoldstein & Guthertz, 1990; Holden, 1994; Malphurs et al., 1996; Jones, Field, Fox, Davalos, Malphurs, \nCarraway, Schanberg & Kuhn, 1997; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1999). Additionally, higher \nfrequencies of touch have been found among mothers with symptoms of depression, indicating over-stimulating \nbehaviour in their use of touch when interacting with their infants (Malphurs et al., 1996; Fergus et al., 1998).  \n \nResults from the present study showed that frequency of touch by depressed mothers was related to their infants\u2019 \nage. Depressed mothers of 10-months old infants, compared with their controls and depressed mothers of 6-\nmonths old infants, lifted, and touched their babies directly and indirectly more frequently. Hence mothers with \ndepressive symptoms of older babies, touched their infants perhaps as a means to control, restrain and direct their \ninfants\u2019 actions, as well as to attract their attention (Field et al., 1990; Fergus et al., 1998). Weiss et al. (2000), \nhave suggested that maternal sensitivity seems to interact with frequency of touch to define its effects. Thus, a \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 13\nmore sensitive mother would use touch to attend to her infant\u2019s developmental cues and emotional states, while \nless sensitive mothers may touch their infants without attending to their demands, leading to more negative \nconsequences on the infant\u2019s sense of security and attachment. Mothers with depressed mood may not be \nresponding to the incremental demands from their babies as they grow older, which could explain the relative \nlack of tactile stimulation directed at younger babies and over-stimulation directed at older babies. Because \nmaternal touch conveys specific messages, its quality appears to be affected by depressed mood. Thus, depressed \nmothers, may be transmitting through touch negative emotions or states without realizing it (Hertenstein, 2002). \n \nInfants\u2019 responsiveness (behavioural, emotional and physiological) develops in the context of an interactive \nrelationship, with touch playing an important role (Stack & Muir, 1990; Stack & LePage, 1996; Stack & Arnold, \n1998). Infants of mothers with depressed mood, in contrast to infants of non-depressed mothers, touched their \nown skin more often, which can be interpreted as a self-comforting behaviour that compensates for the lack of \npositive touch from their mothers. According to Tronick and Gianino (1986), in the context of postnatal \ndepression, the mother fails to respond appropriately to her infant\u2019s regulatory signals. Therefore, the child \nexperiences negative affect, and in his\/her attempts to repair the interactions, turns to self-regulatory behaviours, \nsuch as self-touching, in order to cope with the negative emotional state generated by the uncoordinated feedback \nfrom the mother. Infants are highly perceptive of their personal environment (Murray & Cooper, 1997) and \nrespond to their mothers\u2019 mood disturbance with a variety of behaviours, which may be considered as important \nclues in predicting children\u2019s future development. \n \nIn relation to content of maternal child-directed speech, mothers with depressed mood of 6-month-old babies \nincluded less affective and informative features in their speech compared with control mothers. However, in \nrelation to affect-salient speech, there were effects for infants' age, in that non-depressed mothers of 6- month-old \nbabies included more affective features in their speech compared with depressed mothers of 6-months-olds, and \ncompared with non-depressed mothers of 10 month-old infants. Hence, control mothers of younger infants, used \naffect-salient speech more frequently than control mothers of older infants. In contrast, depressed mothers in both \nage groups showed similar frequencies in the use of affect-salient speech. When information-salient speech was \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 14\nanalysed, depressed mothers used less information salient speech at 6-months in comparison with controls, but no \ndifferences were found between depressed mothers of 10-month-old infants and their controls.  \n \nPrevious research indicates that verbal communication of depressed mothers to infants differs from the structure \nof non-depressed mothers\u2019 speech (Cox et al., 1987; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1999). Murray \net al. (1993) suggested that the focus of the speech might mediate the association between depression and infant \ncognitive development in the first 18 months. When talking to their infants, mothers introduce them in a \nstructured way to elements of their environments such as meanings, spatial settings, and temporal patterns, which \nprovide the main frames for cognitive development (Kaye, 1982). Therefore, changes in maternal speech style in \nrelation to content and function of the utterances, as well as emotional state of the mother, influence the nature of \nmother-infant interaction and thereby the process of early language learning in infants. Results of the present \nstudy suggest that depressed mood in the postnatal period influences the functional content of maternal speech. \nSpecifically, mothers with depressed mood of 6-month-old babies were less likely verbally to share feelings, \ncontribute to emotional exchanges, and impart or confirm cognitive information referring to their infants' \nperceptual experiences. In contrast, among depressed mothers of 10-month-old babies the degree of depression \nwas related to engagement in affect-salient speech, where the use of discourages was positively and significantly \nrelated to the amount of time that mothers held their babies, and the time that babies spent touching their own \nbody. \n \nAccording to the literature, over the first year of life, mothers have been found to shift noticeably from talking to \ntheir infants about internal states and feelings to activities and the environment. Thus, the functional aspect of \nmaternal speech appears to be affected by characteristics of the babies such as age and developmental level \n(Snow, 1977; Phillips, 1973; Bornstein et al., 1992; Penman et al., 1983; Sherrod et al., 1977). These changes are \nassumed to reflect changes in the nature of mother-infant relationship, and are also indicators of maternal \nadjustments to infant growth in communication (Snow, 1977; Sylvester-Bradley & Trevarten, 1978; Tronick & \nGianino, 1986; Zlochower & Cohn 1996). As expected, the results of this study indicate that non-depressed \nmothers of 6-month-old-babies used significantly more affect-salient speech, when compared with depressed \nmothers of 6 month-old infants and non-depressed mothers of 10-month-olds. In contrast, the amount of affect-\n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 15\nsalient speech used by depressed mothers in both age groups remained fairly constant. The results of the present \nstudy suggest that while well mothers appear to use fewer affective features in their speech in relation to older \ninfants, depressed mothers continue to use emotional speech, ignoring  their infants\u2019 age and developmental need \nto include increasing information-salient speech. \n \nIn sum, the present study confirms that both content of speech as well as touch constitute important components \nof the mother-infant interaction (Cohn, Campbell, Matias & Hopkins, 1990). Depressive mood in this study was \nfound to influence the affective quality of maternal speech, as well as touch behaviour of both mother and infant. \nIn non-depressed mother-infant exchanges patterns varied appropriately with development (e.g. Kaye & Fogel, \n1980; Cohn & Tronick, 1987). In contrast mothers with depressed mood of 6-and 10-month-olds responded \ninappropriately in both the verbal and non-verbal domain in relation to their infants\u2019 development. These results \nunderline the importance of considering patterns of interaction in interventions with depressed mothers. \nTherefore, future research should consider training mothers in the adequate use of maternal touch and content of \nspeech, to help them respond appropriately to their infant's behavioural cues. \n           Maternal Touch and Speech \n \n 16\nReferences \nBaumwell, L., Tamis-LeMonda, C. & Bornstein, M.
