INTRODUCTION \n \nCurrent endoscopic OCT probes comprise a single fibre mounted in an external housing1, 2. Lenses are used to focus the \noutput beam from the delivery fibre onto the sample of interest, providing an OCT measurement at a single point. For \ntomographic imaging, the beam is scanned in one or two dimensions to address a line or area of sampling points within \nthe region of interest. A variety of methods have been investigated to achieve this; the use of rotating components within \nthe endoscope tip provides imaging over an arc centred on the probe, which is particularly suitable for looking at the \ninternal surfaces of cylindrical samples3. Implementations involving miniature scanners or MEMS devices have also \nbeen demonstrated, which commonly address a rectangular region of the sample surface4. \nWhile successful, such miniaturised scanning systems can be awkward to implement in a small-diameter probe, and \nrequire electrical power to be delivered to the endoscope tip. We have previously investigated the use of a coherent fibre \nimaging bundle, to allow spatial multiplexing of OCT measurements from many sampling points without the need for \nscanning within the endoscope tip5. \nA coherent fibre bundle, also sometimes known as an imaging fibre bundle, is an ordered arrangement of very small-\ndiameter optical fibres6. Typically, the bundle is comprised of many thousand fibres, each of which occupies the same \nrelative position in the matrix at either end of the bundle. Thus an image projected onto one end of the bundle is \ntransmitted to the opposite end without distortions, other than any variations between the optical loss for individual \nfibres. There is also a pixelation effect resulting from loss of light in the non-guiding regions between the fibre cores, \nwhich results in a fill-factor of less than one. \nOur previous work on fibre-bundle OCT systems was based on a time-domain (TD) OCT system, using a broadband \nsource and mechanical path-length scanning5.  The entire input face of the bundle was illuminated, and measurements \nfrom all fibres acquired simultaneously using a CCD camera. Imaging was achieved using the bundle-based TD-OCT \nsystem, but the use of a camera imposed certain limitations. The frame rate was relatively slow and, because the source \n                                                 \n* h.d.ford@cranfield.ac.uk; Telephone +44 (0)1234 750111; cranfield.ac.uk\/soe\/departments\/processsystems\/engineeringphotonics \nOptical Coherence Tomography and Coherence Domain Optical Methods in Biomedicine XIII,\nedited by James G.

Phase drift of the OCT fringes between frames was therefore a problem, and the pre-digitisation \nfiltering techniques which permit DC removal and envelope detection in point OCT systems were not available, limiting \nimaging depth and contrast. \nSome previous work by a group from California discusses an alternative method for the use of bundles in a time-domain \nOCT system7. In this work, the bundle was placed in the sample arm of a fibre Michelson OCT interferometer. The \nfocusing optics were mounted on a translation stage to allow beam-scanning across the input end of the bundle. Imaging \nof a rabbit trachea was achieved successfully with this system. \nIn our current work on bundles for OCT, we also employ beam scanning at the input to the bundle. However, our system \nuses swept-source illumination. This has many advantages, both in terms of the optical design possibilities and the \npotential image contrast that is achieved when frequency-domain processing is applied.  \nSwept-source processing removes the requirement for a depth-scanning component, which allows us to implement a \ncommon-path probe design in which the bundle is used as a light-conduit, but does not form part of the OCT \ninterferometer. This is advantageous for several reasons. Firstly, it is not at present possible to control the state of \npolarisation (SOP) within all (or indeed any) of the individual fibres of a coherent bundle. Investigation of the output \nSOP from a bundle, when light of a common SOP illuminates the input face, is found to vary significantly between \nfibres8. Thus fringe visibility is likely to be very variable between fibres, leading to poor contrast in some parts of the \nimage when the bundle resides within the interferometer. Secondly, an imaging bundle has a high NA, and the fibres are \ntypically few-moded at wavelengths within the transmission spectrum. This can lead to ghost images, as reported by Xie \net al.7, if multiple spatial modes participate in the interference process. By removing the bundle from the interferometer, \nthe possibility of ghosting is eliminated. The common path arrangement also eliminates problems due to different \ndispersion in the two interferometer arms. \nCoherent fibre bundles typically contain 10,000-100,000 fibres with core diameters ranging from a few micrometres to a \nfew tens of micrometres. For a probe with unit magnification, the lateral resolution of the instrument is equal to the core \nspacing. The depth resolution is determined by the sweep range of the laser source. For the 1300 nm source used in this \nstudy, which has a sweep range of about 100 nm, a depth resolution of about 20 \u03bcm in air would be expected. \n \n \n2.   TRANSMISSION PROPERTIES OF COHERENT FIBRE BUNDLES \n \nStandard coherent bundles are intended primarily for use in the visible. Those that we have used (sold by Schott) are \ntypically few-moded in the middle of the visible range. Internal losses in bundles are higher than in single fibres due to a \ncombination of factors: firstly, for flood-illumination of the bundle, there is the loss of light that impinges on regions \noutside the fibre cores, and is therefore unguided. There is also some absorption in the fibres, and coupling losses can be \nimportant because the NA of bundles is much higher than that of individual fibres, at around 0.5-0.6. The overall loss for \nSchott bundles is quoted at around 40% for a 1 metre bundle in the visible region of the spectrum. The quoted loss \ntypically includes reflections of about 4% at both the proximal and distal polished surfaces.  \nReflective losses, clearly, occur also for single optical fibres though, for both single fibres and bundles, they can be \nsuppressed by angle-polishing the ends of the guide and\/or application of coatings to the end surfaces. The quoted bundle \nloss must be treated with caution, since fill-factor losses are not applicable if light is focused into an individual core \nwithin the bundle, as is sometimes the case in this work. Specialist bundles for the near IR are available and should \nperform better for these wavelengths than the standard type. \nWe have investigated the performance of two types of imaging bundle supplied by Schott. Both are made from types of \ncrown glass. Wound bundles are formed by stacking and then drawing square-packed \u201csub-bundles\u201d (comprising 5 x 5 \nfibres) down to a side dimension of 50 \u03bcm, winding these sub-bundles onto a mandrel, embedding the region designed to \nform the end-sections into a resin matrix, then cutting and polishing the ends. Leached bundles are manufactured from \nmany thousand hexagonally-packed rods, comprising core, cladding and secondary cladding fused into a rigid bar, \ndrawing the rod to achieve the required core diameter, then etching away the secondary cladding from all except the end \nsections to leave a flexible image conduit. \nIn the visible region of the spectrum, the transmission of both wound and leached bundles was as expected. However, for \nOCT, the optimum wavelengths for use with tissue are in the near infra-red. The bundle transmission was also measured, \ntherefore, in this region. The transmission drops off at the higher wavelengths, and the glass exhibits an inconvenient OH \nabsorption at around 1400 nm9 which, since the scanning laser operates in the range 1280-1380 nm, affects the upper end \nof the sweep range particularly severely. The overall transmission of a 1350 mm long bundle, measured with the swept \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7168  71682P-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Feb 2011 to 138.250.112.35.

Since the beam must traverse the bundle \ntwice in the OCT system, less than 1% of the initial coupled power is returned to the detector, ignoring all other losses in \nthe system. We will address this problem in two ways. The simplest means to minimise transmission losses is to use a \nshorter bundle; lengths of about 0.5 m are readily available. Another possibility is to use a bundle specifically designed \nfor use in the infra-red. These are now available and should offer much-improved performance, though the spectral \ntransmission characteristics for the entire wavelength range of interest are not readily available.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Schematic diagrams of Schott imaging bundles. Left, a sub-bundle from a wound bundle, with photograph of a \nlarger region of the bundle, showing square packing with irregularities. Right, schematic of a leached bundle, \nshowing hexagonal close packing of the fibres.  \n \nIt is also important for the use of bundles in OCT that internal cross-coupling between the fibres should be negligible. As \nwavelength increased, the two types of bundle differed in their ability to confine the injected light to a particular fibre \ncore within the bundle. In the leached bundle, 1300 nm light was well-confined to a single core but, at 1550 nm, light \nfocused into a single core emerged at the distal end from multiple cores. Despite the presence of interstitial absorbers \nbetween the fibre cores of the sub-bundles, the wound bundle was unable to confine light to a single core at the lower \nwavelength of 1300 nm. Light coupled into a single fibre emerged from the entire group of 25 fibres in the local sub-\nbundle, although one fibre often tended to be more strongly illuminated than the others. At 1550 nm, the cross-coupling \nbecame stronger, and the output light was more equally distributed between the fibres of the sub-bundle, even coupling \npartially to neighbouring sub-bundles. Thus we concluded that, although the leached bundle could be used in a 1300 nm \nOCT system, the type of wound bundle investigated was unsuited for use in OCT at NIR wavelengths. \n \n \n3.   BUNDLE-BASED SWEPT-SOURCE OCT PROBE DESIGN \n \n3.1 General description \n \nThe OCT probe design, shown in figure 1, incorporates a coherent fibre bundle and a high-speed swept laser source at \n1330 nm centre wavelength. The system operates in the spectral domain, with a fixed path-length imbalance. \nMechanical scanning of the beam is still required, but it is now positioned remotely, at the input to the bundle, while \nmechanical motion of components within the endoscopic section is avoided. A common-path configuration has been \nchosen. This is attractive when using bundles, because it avoids problems associated with polarisation variations between \nthe bundle fibres; it is difficult to see how polarisation-matching could be achieved for all fibres of the bundle \nsimultaneously in the popular Michelson interferometer configuration. The polarisation state in a proportion of the fibres \nwill always be poorly matched to that of the reference beam, resulting in low contrast for these imaging positions. \nA Fizeau arrangement is possible, with the reference beam derived either from the distal bundle end reflection or from an \nexternal reflector10. These are both of interest, particularly in benchtop applications, as they allow for very compact \noptics at the probe tip. However, both do have drawbacks. If the reference is derived from the fibre end reflection, a \n \n50 \u03bcm \n8 \u03bcm core \n50\n \u03bcm\n \n10 \u03bcm pixel \n \n8 \u03bcm pixel \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7168  71682P-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Feb 2011 to 138.250.112.35. Terms of Use:  http:\/\/spiedl.org\/terms\n  \nbalancing interferometer will almost certainly be required to match the relatively long path length within the probe \ninterferometer, and this reduces the signal-to-noise performance that can be achieved. An external reflector avoids the \nnecessity for a balancing interferometer, but is more difficult to arrange practically, with an appropriate path-length \nimbalance, in a system designed for endoscopic use. Therefore, a third alternative, shown in the figure, was selected for \nthis investigation. \n \nFigure 2. Schematic of a common-path OCT imaging system using a Michelson interferometer at the probe tip and \nincorporating a coherent bundle with a 20 kHz swept wavelength source.  \n \nA miniature Michelson interferometer was constructed at the probe tip, using a custom 20\/80 beamsplitter cube, specially \ndesigned to perform well over a 100 nm bandwidth. The purpose of the unequal split ratio was to achieve a ratio of \nsignal\/reference beam powers appropriate for good visibility OCT fringes, without the necessity for attenuation of the \nreference beam. The 20\/80 split ratio implies side-illumination of the sample, which is preferable in any case as it allows \nall the optical elements at the probe tip to be centred on the optical axis, allowing a relatively small probe diameter to be \nachieved by the use of small-diameter components. As with any design using an external reflector, suppression of the \nreflection from the distal end of the bundle is then necessary. This can be achieved by a combination of angle polishing \nthe output surface (at an angle of 8-12o) and\/or applying an anti-reflective coating to this surface. \n \n3.2 Scanning optics \n \nThe output beam from the swept source is delivered via a single-mode optical fibre. Light is routed from the laser, via a \nThorlabs INT-COM optoelectronic module containing a broadband circulator, to the optical bench. The module also \ncontains a fibre wavelength multiplexer, to allow a visible red laser to be mixed with the 1300 nm light for aiming \npurposes.  \nAll fibre connections between the laser output and the OCT probe input have angle-polished end connectors to minimise \nstray reflections. At the output fibre, an aspheric lens is used to collimate the beam onto the scanner. At present this is a \ngalvanometer mirror with a single scan axis. This will shortly be upgraded to allow for either 2D scanning in an arbitrary \ndirection, or full 3D acquisition. A second aspheric lens focuses the scanned beam onto the bundle input face such that \nthe beam waist is smaller than the core diameter of a single fibre. Thus individual fibre cores can be addressed in turn. \n20 kHz swept source\nDetector\nCirculatorImage acquisition and\nprocessing\nScanning\noptics\nImaging fibre \nbundle\nMirror\nSample\n20\/80 BS\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7168  71682P-4\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Feb 2011 to 138.250.112.35.

Schematic of Thorlabs INT-COM light delivery and balanced detector module for common path OCT systems.  \n \nThe beam is currently scanned raster-fashion across the input end of the bundle. The scan rate for the beam is selected to \nensure a quasi-static beam during the 50 \u03bcs duration of the wavelength sweep. Step-and-settle scanning, where the beam \nis moved rapidly between fibres, stopping at each fibre in turn, will also be investigated. However, this is likely to prove \nslower, given the scan accuracy required to achieve optimum coupling into each fibre in the bundle. The mirror scan is \nsynchronised with the acquisition of data; a fast digitiser collects many hundred data points in the z dimension (depth) \nfor each laser sweep. When this is repeated for each of the several hundred fibres within one raster, 2D data can be \nacquired and displayed very rapidly. A raster scan rate of 80 Hertz has been achieved using this method. Once scanning \nis extended to the other dimension, full-field data of about 200 x 200 pixels is expected to be acquired in 1-5 seconds. \n \n3.3 Probe optics \n \nThe leached imaging bundle has an NA in excess of 0.5; much higher than the typical NA of about 0.1 that characterises \na standard single mode optical fibre. A large NA is an advantage at the input end, as light can be injected into the bundle \nwith a low coupling loss. Although the large NA can lead to multi-moding, this is generally avoided by using an input \nlens with a much lower NA. However, the situation in the probe tip is more complicated. A large NA results in a small \nbeam waist, but a poor Rayleigh range, so it becomes necessary to reduce the NA to improve the depth of focus. This in \nturn leads to a magnification of greater than 1 and reduced lateral resolution, so a compromise must be reached between \nall the interdependent imaging parameters. \nIt is not desirable to work with a very large magnification. Although a larger sample region can be imaged with each \nraster the lateral resolution, which is limited by the bundle-fibre core separation, also increases, and small details of the \nsample structure will be obscured. It was decided, in our system, to work with a magnification of 2.5-3. This provides a \nRayleigh range of about 100 \u03bcm with a lateral resolution of 25-30 \u03bcm. \nIn contrast to a single-fibre OCT probe, the focusing optics must ensure low-loss, low-aberration imaging for off-axis \nobject points. The field of view for the probe lens is typically rather small, since the coherent bundle diameter is unlikely \nto exceed 2 mm. However, given the other constraints on the system, significant care is nevertheless required to ensure \nadequate operation towards the periphery of the images. The use of high-quality lenses is essential. At present, with a 1 \nmm diameter bundle, aspheric lenses result in well-focused images of peripheral fibres but, for larger diameter bundles, \ncoated, multi-element lenses are likely to be the best solution. \n \n3.4 Data acquisition and processing \n \nLight returning from the OCT probe re-enters the delivery fibre, and is directed by the circulator to one arm of a \nbalanced detector contained within the Thorlabs INT-COM module. Despite the use of angled-polish FC\/APC \nconnectors in the delivery fibres, sufficient light is returned from the fibre connections to give an appreciable DC level at \nthe detector. A small amount of light, picked off from the output fibre using a 95\/5 coupler, and routed to the second arm \nof the balanced detector via a variable optical attenuator, allows much of this stray light to be balanced out, thereby \nimproving OCT contrast. \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7168  71682P-5\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Feb 2011 to 138.250.112.35.

The output from the detector is passed to a high-speed digitiser card, \nsynchronised both to the 20 kHz laser scanning frequency and to the scanning mirror, via a position sensor in the mirror \ndrive circuit. The required number of sampling points per laser sweep, and the overall rate of sample acquisition, can be \nselected at will. For work carried out to date using this system, about 800 sample points have been acquired for each \nsweep of the laser. This is ample for sampling of fringes corresponding to an imaging depth of several millimetres. The \nsample number determines the required sampling rate, since the laser repeat frequency of 20 kHz is fixed. The total \nnumber of A-scans per raster is currently set to about 200. Since the number of fibres across the diameter of the bundle is \nof the order of 100, this ensures that each fibre on the raster is sampled at least once, assuming good coupling into the \nfibres at all times. \nA Fourier transform is performed on the acquired data from the digitizer, and the logarithm of the result is calculated to \nproduce the OCT images. The program provides a real-time display. Although the number of lateral samples is user-\nselectable, the lateral resolution is ultimately determined by the fibre core separation, and the lateral image size by the \ndiameter of fibre bundle used. \nIn practice, unless the orientation of the rows of bundle fibres is perfectly aligned with the raster scan, the coupling will \nvary periodically. This is illustrated in figure 4(a). If we assume a focused beam waist no larger than the core diameter, \ngood coupling is achieved when the beam is reasonably well-centred on the fibre core. This is the case over a certain \nportion of the scan, and then coupling decreases gradually as the beam moves off towards an interstitial \u2018dead spot\u2019. \nCoupling then begins to improve again, and the cycle repeats across the width of the bundle. Image smoothness should \nbe improved, at the expense of a small reduction in lateral resolution and power at the detector, by enlarging the beam \nwaist at the bundle input, to a diameter larger than that of the fibre cores, as shown in figure 4(b). At this end of the \nbundle, where compactness is less critical, a large-diameter lens is helpful to reduce losses for light returning to the \ndetector. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

RESULTS \n \nThe system was tested, initially on highly-reflective glass and plastic samples and subsequently on samples of vegetable \ntissue. Results from a glass microscope cover slip are shown in figure 5(a). The front and rear surfaces, represented by \nthe top and bottom lines in the image, are clearly visible, separated by about 200 \u03bcm. The intermediate line is due to a \nself-interference between the front and rear surfaces of the cover slip, and appears because the reflected intensities for \nthis object are comparable to that of the reference reflection. Unlike the other two lines in the image, this line does not \n \n8 \u03bcm pixel \n \n8 \u03bcm pixel (b) (a) \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7168  71682P-6\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Feb 2011 to 138.250.112.35.

The SNR is low in this image, probably as a result \nof the very high bundle transmission loss, but two layers can be clearly distinguished, separated by about 100 \u03bcm. \nFeatures arising from the bundle characteristics are visible within the images. There is a distinctive vertical \u2018striping\u2019, \nwhich corresponds to illumination by individual fibres, and a lack of signal in the non-transmitting interstitial regions. \nThe striping is prominent here because the image represents quite a small number of image points at the system \nresolution; the number of fibres across the image is about 65. The appearance could be smoothed by binning. However, it \nwould also be desirable to select a bundle, perhaps of greater diameter, containing a larger number of fibres, of smaller \ncore diameter and separation. This would give a greater density of data points within the image. \nAnother feature of figure 5(b) is the periodic variation in intensity across the image, attributed to the effect described \nabove, where the coupling of input light to the bundle fibres varies within the raster scan. At present we do not have the \nability to scan in two dimensions, but the same effect can be simulated by translating the bundle in a direction normal to \nthe line of the raster. When the bundle is moved manually in this way through a few micrometres, the regions of \nmaximum illumination move laterally, as expected. Figure 5(c) is an average of five OCT images, taken from a region of \nthe sample close to that shown in figure 5(b). In this figure it is possible to distinguish three layers. The bundle has been \ntranslated normal to the raster by about 2 \u03bcm between each of the five acquisitions, and the lateral intensity variation is \nnow much less pronounced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5.

DISCUSSION \n \nOCT imaging using a swept-source OCT probe incorporating a coherent fibre bundle has been demonstrated for both a \nhighly reflective and a biological sample. The system resolution is currently about 30 \u03bcm in the lateral direction and \nabout 20 \u03bcm in depth (both defined in air). The Rayleigh range is about 100 \u03bcm. The maximum number of fibres per \nraster, corresponding to a diameter of the imaging bundle, is about 100, which currently places the limitation of the \ndensity of imaging points for a single raster. This could be increased for the existing bundle by translating the sample \nand merging adjacent images.  \nImaging bundles are also available from other manufacturers. These alternative bundles are fused throughout their \nlength, which makes them much less flexible than the Schott bundles, and are manufactured from doped silica, rather \nthan glass. The transmission properties in the near infra-red are not well documented. The core shape and spacing are \nboth irregular, unlike the close-packed, circular cores of the Schott bundles, and the fill factor tends to be lower11.  The \nirregularity of the cores serves to prevent inter-fibre coupling, which increases as cores become smaller and more closely \nspaced12, and in such bundles the cores can be as small as 2 \u03bcm, which offers a potential increase in lateral resolution. \nThese components therefore merit investigation for use in OCT. \nOur immediate plans for development of our swept-source bundle-based OCT system are to implement two-dimensional \nscanning and to investigate the effect of substituting either a shorter, or an IR-specific bundle for the current 1350 mm \nlong bundle. We expect thereby to improve image contrast significantly and expand the range of sample types accessible \nto our system. In the medium term we aim to improve the data density of our images by the acquisition of alternative \nbundles, containing more fibres of smaller core size and spacing.  \n55\n0 \n\u03bcm\n \n2 mm \n(c) (a) (b) (c)\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7168  71682P-7\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Feb 2011 to 138.250.112.35.

This is because of beam \u2018walk-off\u2019 from the reference mirror for large-angle rays. Modification of the optical \narrangement in the probe-end imaging system will reduce this problem. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThe authors acknowledge the award of a grant (EP\/F034679\/1) from the Engineering and Physical Science Research \nCouncil (EPSRC), UK. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1]   Feldchtein, F.
