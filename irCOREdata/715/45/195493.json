The pioneer\nwork in this direction is of Fournie\u00b4 et al. [11], whose approach is based upon the integration-by-\nparts formula developed in the Malliavin calculus on the Wiener space. They provide a systematic\napproach to the derivation of various Greeks formulas for a relatively general diffusion asset price\nPublished in Statistics and Probability Letters (2010) 80(1) 42-49.\n\u00a4Email Eddress: reiichiro.kawai@gmail.com.

Since then, there has long been a natural and nontrivial question whether a similar\nMalliavin calculus approach is applicable in the case of jump processes.\nThe investigation of the Malliavin calculus for jump processes is initiated in Bismut [4] based\nupon the Girsanov density transformwith a view towards the study of the existence and the smooth-\nness of the density. Various types of Malliavin calculus and logarithmic derivatives have been stud-\nied on the Poisson space or on the Wiener-Poisson space. In particular, the existence of weights for\nthe logarithmic derivatives dates back to the work of Bichteler, Gravereaux and Jacod [3], while the\nuniqueness and the closed forms of the weight have not been established in the general framework.\nFor practical considerations, however, it is most important to have closed, but not necessarily\nunique, weights on hand, in order to design an efficient Monte Carlo evaluation. In this direction,\nGreeks formulas are obtained in Davis and Johansson [9] and Cass and Friz [8] for jump diffusion\nprocesses. Their approach consists of conditioning on the jump component and then performing\nthe Malliavin calculus techniques on the diffusion component. In other words, their models are\nrequired to be a superposition of independent jump and diffusion components, where the diffusion\none must not be degenerate. On the other hand, El-Khatib and Privault [10] applied the Malliavin\ncalculus focused on the Poisson arrival times due to Carlen and Pardoux [5], while Bally et al.\n[1] took a unified approach considering the derivatives with respect to both the Poisson arrival\ntimes and the amplitude of the jumps. Kawai and Kohatsu-Higa [13] derives formulas for Le\u00b4vy\nprocess models of time-changed Brownian motion type, by employing the Gaussian Malliavin\ncalculus conditionally on the time-changing process. Takeuchi [17] studied the same problem for\nthe stochastic differential equations with jumps via a martingale approach. Kawai and Takeuchi\n[14] studied the computation of the Greeks of European payoffs for an asset price dynamics defined\nwith gamma processes and with Brownian motions, possibly time-changed by one of the gamma\nprocesses. In Kawai and Takeuchi [14], various well known financial models, such as the Black-\nScholes model and the variance gamma model of Madan, Carr and Chang [15], are within its\nframework. The key idea there is to apply a scaling property of the gamma distribution with\nrespect to the Esscher transform.\nIn this paper, we take an approach again based on the scaling property, not of the gamma dis-\ntribution as in Kawai and Takeuchi [14], but of the gamma Le\u00b4vy process. This, rather simple,\nextension widens the applicability to the averaged asset price dynamics defined with the gamma\nprocess. A typical example of interest is the (continuous) Asian option, which looks at the time\naverage of underlying asset price dynamics, unlike only the terminal value in the European op-\ntions. Meanwhile, many others, such as European, discrete Asian, average strike Asian, weighted\naverage and spread options, can easily be accommodated in our framework. In addition, Asian\noptions of geometric average type are also within our scope. This work can also be thought of as\n2\na considerable generalization of Kawai and Takeuchi [14], in the sense that some of the European\nGreeks formulas there can be recovered from our results. Finally, our approach taken in this paper\ncan also be applied in various stochastic systems involving gamma processes.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls generalities on the gamma\nprocess and introduces our asset price dynamics model with assumptions to be imposed on its\ncharacterizing parameters. In Section 3, we derive formulas of the Greeks for discontinuous payoff\nfunction of averaged asset price dynamics defined with the gamma process. The derivation of our\nformulas entails rather lengthy proofs of somewhat routine nature. To avoid overloading the paper,\nwe omit nonessential details in some instances. We close this study with some numerical results\nto illustrate remarkable improvements in Monte Carlo simulations in terms of estimator variance\nrelative to the finite difference estimation.\n2 Preliminaries\nLet us begin with general notations which will be used throughout the text. For each positive\ninteger k, \u00b6k indicates the partial derivative with respect to k-th argument. We fix (W;F ;P) as\nour underlying the probability space. We denote by EP the expectation under the probability\nmeasure P. We denote by dx(dy) the Dirac delta measure on R with concentration at x 2 R, while\nBe := (\u00a1e ;+e) is the open ball around the origin with radius e > 0. Let fYt : t \u00b8 0g be a one-sided\npure-jump Le\u00b4vy process in [0;+\u00a5) with the Le\u00b4vy measure\nn(dz) = a\ne\u00a1bz\nz\ndz; z 2 (0;+\u00a5);\nwhere a > 0 and b > 0. The stochastic process fYt : t \u00b8 0g is then called a gamma process with\nparameter (a;b), whose marginal has the gamma distribution with characteristic function\nEP\n\u00a3\neiyYt\n\u00a4\n= exp\nh\nt\nZ\n(0;+\u00a5)\n\u00a1\neiyz\u00a11\u00a2n(dz)i= \u00b31\u00a1 iy\nb\n\u00b4\u00a1at\n:\nMoreover, the marginal density function at time t is given in the form\nf Pt (y) =\nbat\nG(at)\nyat\u00a11e\u00a1by; y 2 (0;+\u00a5); (2.1)\nwhere G(p) is the gamma function of order p> 0.\nThroughout the paper, we fix T > 0. Define L :=\n\u00a9\nl 2 R : EP[elY1] < +\u00a5\n\u00aa\n= (\u00a1\u00a5;b). For\nl 2 L, define a new probability measure Ql by\ndQl\ndP\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\nFT\n:=\nelYT\nEP\n\u00a3\nelYT\n\u00a4 = exp\u00a3lYT \u00a1jT (l )\u00a4;\n3\nwhere jT (l ) := aT ln\n\u00a1\nb=(b\u00a1l )\u00a2 and where (Ft)t2[0;T ] is the natural filtration generated by fYt :\nt 2 [0;T ]g. This measure change is the simplest form of the Girsanov transformation, often called\nthe Esscher transform in mathematical finance and actuarial science. The following is the key tool\nfor our discussions.\nLemma 2.1. The laws of the process Y under Ql and of the process Y (l ) := bY=(b\u00a1l ) under P\nare identical.\nProof. It is well known that for Le\u00b4vy processes, the identity of finite dimensional distributions\nimplies the identity of random processes in law. Fix 0= t0 \u00b7 t1 \u00b7 \u00a2\u00a2 \u00a2 \u00b7 tn = T and z1; \u00a2 \u00a2 \u00a2 ;zn 2 R\narbitrarily. Due to the independence of the increments under the measure P, we have\nEQl\n\"\nexp\n\u00c3\ni\nn\n\u00e5\nk=1\nzkYtk\n!#\n=EP\n\"\nexp\n\u00c3\ni\nn\n\u00e5\nk=1\nzkYtk +lYT\n!#\u00b5\n1\u00a1 l\nb\n\u00b6aT\n=\nn\n\u00d5\nj=1\n\u00c3\n1\u00a1 i\u00e5\nn\nk= j zk+l\nb\n!\u00a1a(t j\u00a1t j\u00a11)\u00b5\n1\u00a1 l\nb\n\u00b6a(t j\u00a1t j\u00a11)\n=EP\n\"\nexp\n\u00c3\ni\nn\n\u00e5\nk=1\nzk\nb\nb\u00a1l Ytk\n!#\n;\nwhich proves the claim.\nLet us introduce our asset price dynamics model and with some examples of practical interest\nwithin our scope. Let Z := fZt : t 2 [0;T ]g be a nondecreasing stochastic process in R with Z0 = 0,\nP-a:s:, independent of the process Y := fYt : t 2 [0;T ]g. Our asset price dynamics model fSt : t 2\n[0;T ]g is defined by\nSt := S0 exp [qYt +kZt + c(q ;k)t] ;\nwhere S0 2 (0;+\u00a5), q 2 (0;+\u00a5), k 2 R, and c : (0;+\u00a5)\u00a3R! R with \u00b6kc(q ;k) being well\ndefined for k = 1;2. Let us impose some assumptions on the parameters q and b and on the\nprocess Z.\nAssumption 2.2. We henceforth assume the following;\n(i) 4q < b,\n(ii) there exists a constant p0 > 2 such that EP\n\u00a3\nexp(p0jkjZT )\n\u00a4\n<+\u00a5.\nRemark 2.3. Let us propose some candidates for the process Z, which makes our asset price\ndynamics model of adequate practical interest.\n4\nThe first one is the variance gamma model of Madan, Carr and Chang [15] by setting Z also\nto be a gamma process with a negative k . The model has attracted the attention of finance prac-\ntitioners, and have thus appeared often in the computational finance literature, for example, Carr\nand Madan [7] and Fu [12]. To be precise, set q = 1 and k =\u00a11, and the gamma processes Y and\nZ should be characterized respectively with (a;b) =\n\u00a1\nn\u00a11;(mpn)\u00a11\n\u00a2\nand (a;b) =\n\u00a1\nn\u00a11;(mnn)\u00a11\n\u00a2\nfor some n > 0, where mp = 12\np\nq 2+2s2=n+q=2; and mn = 12\np\nq 2+2s2=n\u00a1q=2.\nThe inverse Gaussian process is another interesting candidate for Z. It is also a subordinator,\ninduced by the inverse Gaussian distribution, whose marginal at time t is identical in law to the first\ntime that a Brownian motion with drift n reaches the positive level t, that is, EP\n\u00a3\ne\u00a1yZt\n\u00a4\n= exp\n\u00a3\u00a1\nt\n\u00a1p\n2y+n2\u00a1 n\u00a2\u00a4. More details on the inverse Gaussian process may be found in Barndorff-\nNielsen [2] and Carr et al. [6].\n3 Sensitivity formulas\nLet m (dt) be a finite Borel measure over [0;T ].

In the context of mathematical finance, the sensitivity (i) and (ii) are called Delta\nand Gamma, respectively. Both of the formulas (iii) and (iv) correspond best to the Vega, that is,\nthe sensitivity with respect to the Black-Scholes volatility parameter.\nOur framework covers several payoffs of practical interest. First, setting m(dt) = TdT (dt)\nreduces to the European framework. With this setting, our results indeed recover the European\nformulas derived in Kawai and Takeuchi [14]. As a matter of course, m(dt) = dt corresponds to\nthe Asian option (also called average price option), while in real financial trading, the continuous\naverage is simply impossible to compute and is thus not very interesting. Meanwhile, we can deal\nwith arithmetic average (discrete Asian) type, which is rather the genuine Asian from a practical\npoint of view, by setting m(dt) = TN\u00a11\u00e5Nk=1 dtk(dt), to be numerically tested later, or a little\nmore generally, a weighted arithmetic average by m(dt) = T\n\u00a1\n\u00e5Nk=1wk\n\u00a2\u00a11\u00e5Nk=1wk dtk(dt) for reals\nfwkgk2N. Options of average strike Asian type and of spread type, respectively with m(dt) =\ndt\u00a1TdT (dt) and m(dt) = T\n\u00a1\u00a1dT=2(dt)+dT (dt)\u00a2, are also within our framework.\nThe proof of Theorem 3.1 is divided into several preliminary results. The first one is concerned\nwith the moments of Y (l )t and of S\n(l )\nt .\nLemma 3.3. Fix t 2 [0;T ] and l 2 L. It holds that for p 2 (\u00a1at;+\u00a5),\nEP\nh\u00a1\nY (l )t\n\u00a2pi= G(at+ p)\n(b\u00a1l )pG(at) ;\nwhile for p 2 (\u00a1\u00a5; p0^ (b\u00a1l )=q),\nEP\nh\u00a1\nS(l )t\n\u00a2pi=\u00b51\u00a1 pq\nb\u00a1l\n\u00b6\u00a1at\nSp0 exp\n\u00a1\npc(q ;k) t\n\u00a2\nEP\n\u00a3\nexp\n\u00a1\npk Zt\n\u00a2\u00a4\n:\n6\nProof. The first assertion is straightforward by the density (2.1), while the second follows from\nthe independence of Y and Z, the exponential integrability of Z in Assumption 2.2, and again the\ndensity (2.1).\nWe fix e 2 (0;b=2) in what follows. Note that Be \u00bd L, and p0 ^ (b\u00a1 l )=q > 2 under As-\nsumption 2.2. The following lemma later plays an important role for the the interchange of the\nderivative (with respect to l ) and the expectation EP.\nLemma 3.4. The random variables S(l )t and Y\n(l )\nt are in Lp0^(b\u00a1l )=q (W), uniformly in t 2 [0;T ]\nand l 2 Be .\nProof. The assertion is the direct consequence of Assumption 2.2 and Lemma 3.3.\nThe following lemma is also an important tool.\nLemma 3.5. For k = 0;1;2 and for l 2 Be , it holds that\n\u00b6\n\u00b6l\nZ T\n0\nS(l )t\n\u00a1\nY (l )t\n\u00a2kZt m (dt) = Z T\n0\n\u00b6\n\u00b6l\n\u00b3\nS(l )t\n\u00a1\nY (l )t\n\u00a2k\u00b4Zt m (dt) ; P-a:s:\nProof. Clearly, for each t 2 [0;T ],M(l )t := S(l )t\n\u00a1\nY (l )t\n\u00a2kZt is continuous in l , so is (\u00b6=\u00b6l )M(l )t =\nM(l )t\n\u00a1\nqY (l )t + k\n\u00a2\n=(b\u00a1l ). Since Y (l )t is nondecreasing in t, we have for h 2 (0;b\u00a1l ),Z T\n0\nZ 1\n0\n\u00b5\n\u00b6\n\u00b6x\nM(x )t\n\u00af\u00af\nx=l+dh\n\u00b62\ndd m(dt)\n\u00b7 S20 exp\n\u00a1\n2qY (x )T +2jkjZT +2jc(q ;k)jT\n\u00a2\u00a1\nY (x )T\n\u00a22kZ2T\n\u00c3\nqY (x )T + k\nb\u00a1x\n!2\nm([0;T ])\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\nx=l+h\n:\nBy the Taylor theorem, it holds that\n1\nh\n\u00c3Z T\n0\nM(l+h)t m(dt)\u00a1\nZ T\n0\nM(l )t m(dt)\n!\n\u00a1\nZ T\n0\n\u00b6\n\u00b6l\nM(l )t m(dt)\n=\nZ T\n0\nZ 1\n0\n\u00b5\n\u00b6\n\u00b6x\nM(x )t\n\u00af\u00af\nx=l+dh\u00a1\n\u00b6\n\u00b6l\nM(l )t\n\u00b6\nm(dt);\nwhich tends to 0 as h # 0.

Finally, the finiteness of the\nabove last line follows from the moment formulas of Lemma 3.3.\nWe investigate the integrability of the random variable F(l )j , H\n(l )\nj , I\n(l )\nj and J\n(l ) of positive\norder.\nLemma 3.7.

We consider a digital payoff F(F0) = 1(F0 > C), for some\nC > 0, with the weighting measure m(dt) = TN\u00a11\u00e5Nk=1 dk TN (dt), so that F(F0) is an equidis-\ntant discrete Asian option. We divide [0;T ] into N = 20 intervals. Let us emphasize that as\ndiscussed in Remark 3.2, our approach is rigorously valid for this discrete Asian options, not\nas a numerical approximation of continuously averaged Asians. Fix S0 = 100, C = 110, T = 1,\na = b = 6 and q = 1. In our experiments, the process Z is an inverse Gaussian (Le\u00b4vy) process,\nwhich is introduced in Remark 2.3. We set k = \u00a11 and n = 30. Concerning the generation\nof a inverse Gaussian process, we follow an algorithm proposed in Rydberg [16]. By setting\nc(q ;k) = a ln(1\u00a1q=b)+\u00a1p\u00a12k+n2\u00a1n\u00a2, we can induce the model risk-neutral. For simplicity,\nwe omit the risk-free discounting.

For clear comparisons, the convergence\nof the finite difference method is also provided. The figures and the variance ratios evidently in-\ndicate a faster convergence of our Greeks formulas. Note also that in general, the finite difference\napproximation yields some bias.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to Co-Editor-in-Chief Prof.Hira Koul for his careful reading and valu-\nable suggestions.
