The sample used comprises 221 414 galaxies with\nmeasured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection,\nimproving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is de-\nrived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function\nis determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a\nself-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The co-\nvariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different\napproaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that\nthe input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the pos-\nsible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using\nsimulations, analytic models, and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these inves-\ntigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the\nmatter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows\nevidence for the \u2018baryon oscillations\u2019 that are predicted in CDM models. Fitting to a\nCDM model, assuming a primordial ns = 1 spectrum, h = 0.72 and negligible neu-\ntrino mass, the preferred parameters are \u2126mh = 0.168\u00b1 0.016 and a baryon fraction\n\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.185\u00b10.046 (1\u03c3 errors). The value of \u2126mh is 1\u03c3 lower than the 0.20\u00b10.03\nin our 2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to\nthe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the\ntreatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density signif-\nicantly below the standard \u2126m = 0.3: in combination with CMB data from WMAP,\nwe infer \u2126m = 0.231\u00b1 0.021.\nKey words: large-scale structure of universe \u2013 cosmological parameters\n2 Cole et al.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nEarly investigations of density fluctuations in an expanding\nuniverse showed that gravity-driven evolution imprints char-\nacteristic scales that depend on the average matter density\n(e.g. Silk 1968; Peebles & Yu 1970; Sunyaev & Zeldovich\n1970). Following the development of models dominated by\nCold Dark Matter (Peebles 1982; Bond & Szalay 1983), it\nbecame clear that measurements of the shape of the cluster-\ning power spectrum had the potential to measure the matter\ndensity parameter \u2013 albeit in the degenerate combination\n\u2126mh (h \u2261 H0\/100 km s\u22121Mpc\u22121).\nAt first, the preferred CDM model was the \u2126m = 1\nEinstein\u2013de Sitter universe, together with a relatively low\nbaryon density from nucleosynthesis. Baryons were thus ap-\nparently almost negligible in structure formation. However,\ncluster X-ray data showed that the true baryon fraction must\nbe at least 10\u201315%, and this was an important observation in\ndriving acceptance of the current \u2126m \u2243 0.3 paradigm (White\net al. 1993). This higher baryon fraction yields a richer\nphenomenology for the matter power spectrum, so that non-\nnegligible \u2018baryon oscillations\u2019 are expected as acoustic oscil-\nlations in the coupled matter-radiation fluid affect the grav-\nitational collapse of the CDM (e.g. Eisenstein & Hu 1998).\nThe most immediate effect of a large baryon fraction is to\nsuppress small-scale power, so that the universe resembles a\npure CDM model of lower density (Peacock & Dodds 1994;\nSugiyama 1995), but there should also be oscillatory fea-\ntures that modify the power by of order 5\u201310%, in a manner\nanalogous to the acoustic oscillations in the power spectrum\nof the Cosmic Microwave Background.\nIn order to test these predictions, accurate surveys\nof large cosmological volumes are required. A number of\npower-spectrum investigations in the 1990s (e.g. Efstathiou,\nSutherland & Maddox 1990; Ballinger, Heavens & Taylor\n1995; Tadros et al. 1999) confronted the data with a simple\nprescription of pure CDM using an effective value of \u2126mh\n(the \u0393 prescription of Efstathiou et al. 1992). The first sur-\nvey with the statistical power to make a full treatment of the\npower spectrum worthwhile was the 2dF Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (Colless et al. 2001; 2003). Observations for this sur-\nvey were carried out between 1997 and 2002, and by 2001 the\nsurvey had amassed approximately 160 000 galaxy redshifts.\nThis sample was the basis of a power-spectrum analysis by\nPercival et al. (2001; P01), which yielded several important\nconclusions. P01 used mock survey data generated from the\nHubble volume simulation (Evrard et al. 2002) to show\nthat the power spectrum at wavenumbers k < 0.15 hMpc\u22121\nshould be consistent with linear perturbation theory. Com-\nparison with the data favoured a low-density model with\n\u2126mh = 0.20\u00b10.03, and also evidence, at about the 2\u03c3 level,\nfor a non-zero baryon fraction (the preferred figure being\naround 20%). In reaching these conclusions, it was essential\nto make proper allowance for the window function of the\nsurvey, since the raw power spectrum of the survey has an\nexpectation value that is the true cosmic power spectrum\nconvolved with the power spectrum of the survey geometry.\nThe effect of this convolution is a significant distortion of\nthe overall shape of the spectrum, and a reduction in visi-\nbility of the baryonic oscillations. The signal-to-noise ratio\nof features in the power spectrum is thus adversely affected\ntwice by the finite survey volume: the cosmic-variance noise\nincreases for small V , and the signal is diluted by convo-\nlution. Both these elements need to be well understood in\norder to achieve a detection.\nThe intention of this paper is to revisit the analysis\nof P01, both to incorporate the substantial expansion in\nsize of the final dataset, and also to investigate the robust-\nness of the results in the light of our improved understand-\ning of the survey selection. Section 2 discusses the dataset\nand completeness masks. Section 3 derives a self-consistent\ntreatment of k-corrections and evolution in order to model\nthe radial selection function. Section 4 outlines the methods\nused for power-spectrum estimation, including allowance for\nluminosity-dependent clustering; the actual data are anal-\nysed in Section 5 with the power spectrum estimate being\npresented in Fig. 12 and Table 2. Section 6 presents a com-\nprehensive set of tests for systematics in the analysis, con-\ncluding that the galaxy power spectrum is robust. Section 7\nthen considers the critical issue of possible differences in\nshape between galaxy and mass power spectra. The data\nare used to fit CDM models in Section 8 and Section 9 sums\nup.\n2 THE 2dF GALAXY REDSHIFT SURVEY\nThe 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) covers approx-\nimately 1800 square degrees distributed between two broad\nstrips, one across the SGP and the other close to the NGP,\nplus a set of 99 random 2 degree fields (which we denote\nby RAN) spread over the full southern galactic cap. The fi-\nnal catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 221 414 galaxies\nselected to an extinction-corrected magnitude limit of ap-\nproximately bJ = 19.45 (Colless et al. 2003; 2001). In order\nto use these galaxy positions to measure galaxy clustering\none first needs an accurate, quantitative description of the\nredshift catalogue. Here we briefly review the properties of\nthe survey and detail how we quantify the complete sur-\nvey selection function. Then, in Section 3, we combine this\nwith estimates of the galaxy luminosity function to generate\nunclustered catalogues that will be used in the subsequent\nclustering analysis.\n2.1 Photometry\nThe 2dFGRS input catalogue was intended to reach a uni-\nform extinction-corrected APM magnitude limit of bJ =\n19.45. However, since the original definition of the catalogue,\nour understanding of the calibration of APM photometry\nhas improved. In the preliminary 100k release (Colless et al.\n2001), the APM magnitudes were directly recalibrated using\nCCD data from the EIS (Prandoni et al. 1999; Arnouts et\nal. 2001) and 2MASS (Jarrett et al. 2000) (see Norberg et\nal. 2002b). In the final data release it has been possible to\nimprove the calibration still further (see Colless et al. 2003\nand below). In addition, the Schlegel et al. (1998) extinction\nmaps were finalised after the catalogue was selected; thus,\nthe final survey magnitude limit varies with position. As de-\nscribed in Norberg et al. (2002b) an accurate map of the\nresulting magnitude limit can be constructed. Fig. 1 shows\nthese maps for the final NGP and SGP strips of the survey.\nNote that the maps also serve to delineate the boundary of\n2dFGRS power spectrum 3\nFigure 1. Maps of the extinction-corrected bJ survey magnitude limit in the NGP (upper) and SGP (lower) strips. The original target\nwas a constant limit at bJ = 19.45; the variations from this reflect revisions to the photometric calibration and alterations in corrections\nfor galactic extinction.\nthe survey and the regions cut out around bright stars and\nsatellite tracks.\nThe improvements in the photometry derived from\nthe UK Schmidt plates comes in part because these have\nbeen scanned using the SuperCOSMOS measuring machine\n(Hambly, Irwin & MacGillivray 2001). SuperCOSMOS has\nsome advantages in precision with respect to the APM,\nyielding improved linearity and smaller random errors. In\na similar way to the APM survey, the SuperCOSMOS re-\ncalibration matches plate overlaps (Colless et al. 2003). The\nmagnitudes have been placed on an absolute scale using the\nSDSS EDR (Stoughton et al. 2002) in 33 plates, the ESO\nimaging survey (e.g. Arnouts et al. 2001) in 7, plus the ESO-\nSculptor survey (Arnouts et al. 1997 ).\nWhen the SuperCOSMOS bJ,SC data are compared to\nthe 2dFGRS APM photometry, there is evidence for a small\nnon-linear term, which we eliminate by applying the correc-\ntion\nbJ\n\u2032 = bJ + 0.033([bJ \u2212 18]2 \u2212 1) for bJ > 15.5 (1)\nand a fixed offset for bJ < 15.5. We then determine quasi-\nlinear fits of the form\nbJ\n\u2032\u2032 = AbJ\n\u2032 +B, (2)\nwhere A and B are determined separately for each plate\nto minimize the rms difference bJ\n\u2032\u2032 \u2212 bJ,SC. The final 2dF-\nGRS magnitudes, bJ\n\u2032\u2032, are given in the release database. For\nmany purposes (e.g. defining the colour of a galaxy) the Su-\nperCOSMOS magnitudes are the preferred choice, but for\ndefining the survey selection function we use the final APM\nmagnitudes as it is for these that the survey has a well de-\nfined magnitude limit.\n2.2 Colour data\nSuperCOSMOS has also scanned the UKST rF plates (Ham-\nbly, Irwin & MacGillivray 2001), and these have been cali-\nbrated in the same manner as the bJ plates. The rF plates\nare of similar depth and quality to the bJ plates, giving the\nimportant ability to divide galaxies by colour.\nThe systematic calibration uncertainties are at the level\nof 0.04 mag. rms in each band. This uncertainty is signifi-\ncantly smaller than the rms differences between the Super-\nCOSMOS and SDSS photometry (0.09 mag 3\u03c3 clipped rms\nin each band, as compared with 0.15 mag when APM mag-\nnitudes are used). However, some of this dispersion is not\na true error in SuperCOSMOS: SDSS photometry is not\nperfect, nor are the passbands and apertures used identi-\ncal. A fairer estimate of the random errors can probably be\ndeduced from the histogram of rest-frame colours given be-\nlow in Fig. 2. This shows a narrow peak for the early-type\npopulation with a FWHM of about 0.2 mag. If the intrin-\n4 Cole et al.\nsic width of this peak is extremely narrow such that the\nmeasured width is dominated by the measurement errors\nthis gives us an upper limit on the errors in photographic\nbJ \u2212 rF colour of 0.2\/\n\u221a\n8 ln(2) \u2248 0.085 mag, or an uncer-\ntainty of only 0.06 mag in each band (including calibration\nsystematics).\nIn our power spectrum analysis, we will wish to split the\nsample by rest frame colour so as to compare the clustering\nof intrinsically red and blue subsamples. To achieve this we\nneed to be able to k-correct the observed colours.\n2.2.1 k-corrections\nThe problem we face is this: given a redshift and an observed\nbJ \u2212 rF colour, how do we deduce a consistent k-correction\nfor each band? The simplest solution is to match the colours\nto a single parameter, which could be taken to be the age\nof a single-metallicity starburst. This approach was imple-\nmented using the models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003). Their\nSingle Stellar Populations (SSPs) vary age and metallicity,\nand these variations will be nearly degenerate. In practice,\nwe assumed 0.4 Solar metallicity (Z = 0.008) and found the\nage that matches the data. For very red galaxies, this can\nimply a current age > 13 Gyr; in such cases an age of 13 Gyr\nwas assumed, and the metallicity was raised until the correct\ncolour was predicted.\nIn most cases, this exercise matched the results of the\nBlanton et al. (2003) KCORRECT package (version 3.1b),\nwhich fits the magnitude data using a superposition of re-\nalistic galaxy spectral templates. The results of Blanton et\nal. are to be preferred in the region where the majority of\nthe data lie; this can be verified by taking the full DR1\nugriz data and fitting k-corrections, then comparing with\nthe result of fitting gr only. The differences are small, but\nare smaller than the difference between the KCORRECT re-\nsults and fitting burst models. The main case for which this\nmatters is for the red k-correction for blue galaxies. How-\never, some galaxies can be redder than the reddest template\nused by Blanton et al.; for such cases, the burst models are\nto be preferred. In fact, the two match almost perfectly at\nthe join.\nThe following fitting formula, which we adopt, summa-\nrizes the results of this procedure, and is good to 0.01 mag\nalmost everywhere in the range of interest:\nkbJ =(\u22121.63 + 4.53C)y + (\u22124.03\u2212 2.01C)y2\n\u2212 z\/(1 + (10z)4)\nkrF =(\u22120.08 + 1.45C)y + (\u22122.88\u2212 0.48C)y2,\n(3)\nwhere y \u2261 z\/(1 + z) and C \u2261 bJ \u2212 rF. In most cases, the\ndeviations from the fit are probably only of the order of\nthe accuracy of the whole exercise, so they are ignored in\nthe interests of clarity. The distributions of observed and\nk-corrected rest frame colours are shown in Fig. 2.\nThe histogram of rest frame colours exhibits the well\nknown bimodal distribution (Strateva et al. 2001; Baldry et\nal. 2004). Related spectral quantities such as H\u03b4 absorption\nand the 4000Angstrom break show similar bimodal distri-\nbutions (Kauffmann et al. 2003). In particular, colour is\nstrongly correlated with the 2dFGRS spectral type \u03b7 (see\nfigure 2 of Wild et al. 2005). Thus dividing the sample at a\nrest frame colour of (bJ\u2212rF)z=0 = 1.07 achieves a very sim-\nFigure 2. Photographic bJ\u2212rF colour versus redshift for the 2dF-\nGRS, as observed (top) and in the rest frame (middle). The sep-\naration between \u2018early-type\u2019 (red) and \u2018late-type\u2019 (blue) galaxies\nis very clear. The third panel shows the histogram of k-corrected\nrestframe colours, which is very clearly bimodal. This is strongly\nreminiscent of the distribution of spectral type, \u03b7, and dividing\nthe sample at a rest frame colour of (bJ \u2212 rF)z=0 = 1.07 (dot-\nted line) achieves a very similar separation of early-type \u2018class 1\u2019\ngalaxies from classes 2\u20134, as was done using spectra by Madgwick\net al. (2002).\n2dFGRS power spectrum 5\nFigure 3. Maps of the overall redshift completeness, R(\u03b8), averaged over apparent magnitude, in the NGP and SGP strips.\nilar separation of early-type \u2018class 1\u2019 galaxies from classes\n2\u20134, as was done using spectra by Madgwick et al. (2002).\n2.3 Spectroscopic completeness\nThe spectroscopic completeness, the fraction of 2dFGRS\ngalaxies with reliably measured redshifts, varies across the\nsurvey. This can be due to a failure to measure redshifts\nfrom the observed spectra or to whole fields missing, either\nbecause they were never observed, or because they were re-\njected when they had unacceptably low spectroscopic com-\npleteness. In addition, there is a small level of incomplete-\nness arising from galaxies that were never targeted due to\nrestrictions in fibre positioning. In the samples we analyse\nwe reject all fields (single observations) that have a spec-\ntroscopic completeness less than 70%. As the observed 2dF\nfields overlap in a complex pattern, the completeness varies\nfrom sector to sector, where a sector is defined by a unique\nset of overlapping fields. Maps of the redshift completeness,\nR(\u03b8), of the final survey, constructed as detailed in Norberg\net al. (2002b), are shown in Fig. 3. Here \u03b8 denotes the an-\ngular position on the sky. For the two main survey strips,\n80% of the area has a completeness greater than 80%.\nIn observed fields, the fraction of galaxies for which use-\nful (quality \u2265 3) redshifts have not been obtained increases\nsignificantly with apparent magnitude. In Norberg et al.\n(2002b) (see also Colless et al. 2001), we define an empirical\nmodel of this magnitude dependent incompleteness. In this\nmodel, the fraction of observed galaxies yielding useful red-\nshifts is proportional to 1 \u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5) and, by averaging\nover fields, the parameter \u00b5 is defined for each sector in the\nsurvey. Fig. 4, shows a map of the factor 1 \u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5)\nfor a fiducial apparent magnitude of bJ = 19.5. For a given\napparent magnitude and position the overall redshift com-\npleteness is given by the product\nC(\u03b8,bJ) = A(\u03b8)R(\u03b8)[1\u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5)], (4)\nwhere R(\u03b8) and [1 \u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5)] are the quantities illus-\ntrated in Figs 3 and 4. In each sector, we define the nor-\nmalizing constant A(\u03b8) = \u3008[1\u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5(\u03b8))]\u3009\u22121 averaged\nover the expected apparent magnitude distribution of survey\ngalaxies, so that \u3008C(\u03b8,bJ)\u3009 = R(\u03b8). In general, this magni-\ntude dependent incompleteness is not a large effect. At the\nmagnitude limit of the survey, 50%(80%) of the survey\u2019s\narea has completeness factor, [1\u2212 exp(bJ\u2212\u00b5)], greater than\n88%(80%).\nSince it is easier to measure the redshift of blue emission\nline galaxies than of red galaxies, we expect the level of in-\ncompleteness to be different for our red and blue subsamples.\nSince we are unable to classify a galaxy by rest frame colour\nwithout knowing its redshift, it is not trivial to estimate the\nlevel of incompleteness in each subsample. However, to a\nfirst approximation, we can quantify the incompleteness as\na function of the observed colour. In fact, we can do better\nthan this by noting that our red and blue subsamples are\nquite well separated on a plot of observed colour versus ap-\n6 Cole et al.\nFigure 4. Maps illustrating the redshift completeness at bJ = 19.5 relative to that at bright magnitudes. The magnitude dependence\nof this redshift completeness is assumed to be proportional to 1 \u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5) and the parameter \u00b5 is estimated for each sector in the\nsurvey mask. Here, we plot the factor 1\u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5) for a fiducial magnitude of bJ = 19.5.\nparent magnitude. We can split the galaxies in this plane\ninto two disjoint samples. Quantifying the incompleteness\nfor red and blue subsamples split in this way we find they\nare again reasonably well fit by the model 1\u2212 exp(bJ \u2212 \u00b5),\nbut with \u00b5blue = \u00b5 + 0.65 and \u00b5red = \u00b5 \u2212 0.25. These are\nvalues we use in Section 5.3, where we compare the power\nspectra of the red and blue galaxies.\n3 LUMINOSITY FUNCTION AND\nEVOLUTION\nFor a complete understanding of how the 2dFGRS probes\nthe universe, we need to supplement the selection masks de-\nscribed above with a model for the galaxy luminosity func-\ntion. It will also be necessary to understand how the lumi-\nnosity function depends on galaxy type and how it evolves\nwith redshift.\nIn Norberg et al. (2002b), we demonstrated that a\nSchechter function was a good1 description of the over-\n1 In the sense that the deviations from the Schechter form are\nsufficiently small that they have no important effects on our mod-\nelling of the radial selection function. However, with the high sta-\ntistical power of the 2dFGRS even these very small deviations\nare detected. As a result, the best fit Schechter function param-\nall 2dFGRS luminosity function and we estimated a mean\nk + e correction by fitting Bruzual & Charlot (1993) pop-\nulation synthesis models to a subset of the 2dFGRS galax-\nies for which SDSS g \u2212 r colours were available. Repeat-\ning this procedure for the recalibrated final 2dFGRS mag-\nnitudes yields a Schechter function with \u03b1 = \u22121.18, \u03a6\u2217 =\n1.50 \u00d7 10\u22122 h3Mpc\u22123, M\u2217z=0.1bJ \u2212 5 log10 h = \u221219.57, where\nwe have quoted the characteristic absolute magnitude at\nthe median redshift of the survey, z = 0.1, M\u2217z=0.1bJ \u2261\nM\u2217z=0bJ + k(z = 0.1) + e(z = 0.1) rather than the redshift\nz = 0 value. Since our purpose is to model only those galax-\nies that are in the 2dFGRS, we have ignored the 9% boost\nto \u03a6\u2217 that was applied in Norberg et al. (2002b) to com-\npensate for incompleteness in the 2dFGRS input catalogue.\nThus, the corresponding values from Norberg et al. (2002b)\nare \u03b1 = \u22121.21 \u00b1 0.03, \u03a6\u2217 = (1.47 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 10\u22122 h3Mpc\u22123,\nM\u2217z=0.1bJ \u22125 log10 h = \u221219.50\u00b10.07. The 1-\u03c3 shifts in \u03b1 and\nM\u2217bJ are systematic changes resulting from the photometric\nrecalibration. The uncertainties on each of these parameters\nremain essentially unchanged.2 The luminosity functions de-\neters can vary by more than their formal statistical errors when\ndifferent redshift or absolute magnitude cuts are applied to the\ndata.\n2 In terms of constraints on the local galaxy population these\nnew luminosity function estimates do not add significantly to the\n2dFGRS power spectrum 7\nTable 1. The parameters of the Schechter luminosity functions and k+ e corrections (see equation 7) that define the standard model of\nthe survey selection function. Two Schechter functions are combined to describe the luminosity function of red galaxies.\n\u03a6\u2217\/h3Mpc\n\u22123\nM\u2217z=0.1bJ\n\u2212 5log10 h \u03b1 a b c\nCombined 0.0156 \u221219.52 \u22121.18 0.327 6.18 10.3\nBlue 0.00896 \u221219.55 \u22121.3 0.282 5.67 31.1\nRed 0.00909 \u221219.19 \u22120.5 1.541 6.78 7.95\n0.00037 \u221219.87 \u22120.5 1.541 6.78 7.95\ntermined separately in the NGP, SGP and RAN field regions\nagree extremely well in shape, but are slightly offset inM\u2217bJ .\nIn the standard calibration used in this paper we apply a\nshift of \u22120.0125 in the SGP and 0.022 in the NGP to the\ngalaxy magnitudes and magnitude limits to make all the re-\ngions consistent with the luminosity function estimated from\nthe full survey, but as we shall see, these shifts are so small\nthat they make very little difference.\nThe main problem with the previous procedure was that\nthe evolution is assumed to be known. Here, we take the safer\napproach of estimating empirical k + e corrections directly\nfrom the data. If we model the luminosity function by a func-\ntion \u03c6(L) of the k+e corrected luminosity L, and the radial\ndensity field by a function of redshift \u03c1(z), then following\nSaunders et al. (1990) we can define the joint likelihood as\nL1 = \u03a0i \u03c1(zi)\u03c6(Li)\u222b\u222b\n\u03c1(z)\u03c6(L) dV\ndz\ndLdz\n, (5)\nwhere the product is over the galaxies in the sample. Note\nfor convenience one can select from the 2dFGRS a simple\nmagnitude limited subsample. At each redshift, the range of\nthe luminosity integral in the denominator is determined by\nthe apparent magnitude limits and the model k + e correc-\ntion. One could then parameterize \u03c6(L), \u03c1(z) and k(z)+e(z)\nand seek their maximum likelihood values. In practice, this\ndoes not work well for our data as, without a constraint on\n\u03c1(z), there is a near degeneracy between k+ e and the faint\nend slope of the luminosity function. This problem can be\nremoved by introducing an additional factor into the likeli-\nhood to represent the probability of observing a given \u03c1(z).\nEstimating this probability using the randomly distributed\nclusters model of Neyman & Scott (1952) (see also Peebles\n1980), the likelihood becomes\nL = L1 \u00d7 \u03a0r exp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n(\u03c1(zr)\/\u03c1\u00af\u2212 1)2Nr\n(1 + 4piJ3Nr\/Vr)\n)\n. (6)\nHere \u03c1(zr), Nr and Vr are respectively the galaxy density,\nnumber of galaxies and comoving volume of the rth radial\nbin. The overall mean galaxy density is \u03c1\u00af and J3 is the usual\nintegral over the two-point correlation function. We adopt\nJ3 = 400 (h\n\u22121Mpc)3, consistent with the measured 2dF-\nGRS correlation function (Hawkins et al. 2003).\nNote that when splitting the sample into the two\nresults from Norberg et al. (2002b) and Madgwick et al. (2002) as\nthe uncertainties remain dominated by systematic uncertainties in\nthe photometric zero-point, survey completeness and evolutionary\ncorrections. However, for the purposes of quantifying the survey\nselection function it is important to derive estimates consistent\nwith the new calibration.\nFigure 5. The solid curves in the upper panel show stepwise\nestimates of the overall 2dFGRS luminosity function and esti-\nmates for red and blue subsets, split at a restframe colour of\nbJ \u2212 rF = 1.07. They are plotted as a function of absolute mag-\nnitude at z = 0.1, which we define in terms of z = 0 absolute\nmagnitude as M\u2217z=0.1\nbJ\n\u2261 M\u2217z=0\nbJ\n+ k(z = 0.1) + e(z = 0.1). The\nsmooth dashed curves are Schechter functions convolved with the\nmodel of the magnitude measurement errors. It is these luminosity\nfunctions that are used to construct random unclustered galaxy\ncatalogues. The corresponding maximum likelihood estimates of\nthe k+e corrections (relative to their values at z = 0.1) are shown\nby the solid curves in the lower panel. The long-dashed line in the\nupper panel is an STY estimate of the overall luminosity function\nwhen the k + e correction shown as the long-dashed line in the\nlower panel is adopted.\ncolour classes we ignore any evolutionary correction to their\ncolours. This cannot be exactly correct, but at the quite\nred dividing colour of bJ \u2212 rF = 1.07, galaxies are not star\nforming and the evolutionary colour correction is expected\nto be small. This approximation is supported empirically by\nthe central panel of Fig. 2, which shows that the rest-frame\n8 Cole et al.\ncolour corresponding to the division between the red and\nblue populations appears to be independent of redshift.\nThe luminosity functions and corresponding k + e cor-\nrections that result from applying this method are shown\nin Fig. 5. Note that to model the selection function all that\nwe require is the combined k + e correction for the red and\nblue components of the luminosity function. Thus for mod-\nelling the selection function we do not make use of the colour\ndependent k-corrections derived in Section 2.2.1 . To utilise\nthese would require a bivariate model of the galaxy luminos-\nity function so that bJ\u2212rF colours could be assigned to each\nmodel galaxy. We have used a stepwise parameterization of\nthe luminosity function and assumed k+e corrections of the\nform\nk + e =\naz + bz2\n1 + cz3\n, (7)\nwhere a, b and c are constants. The solid lines in the upper\npanel show the luminosity function estimates for the full\nsample and for the red and blue subsets. The solid curves\nin the lower panel show the corresponding maximum like-\nlihood k + e corrections. For the purpose of constructing\nunclustered galaxy catalogues it is useful to fit these esti-\nmates using Schechter functions convolved with the mea-\nsured distribution of magnitude errors from Norberg et al.\n(2002b). The smooth dashed curves that closely match each\nof the maximum likelihood estimates are these convolved\nSchechter functions. In the case of the red galaxies we have\nused the sum of two Schechter functions to produce a suffi-\nciently good fit. The parameters of these Schechter functions\nand the corresponding k+e correction parameters are listed\nin Table 1.\nThese luminosity functions can be compared with those\nof Madgwick et al. (2002), who estimated the luminosity\nfunctions of 2dFGRS galaxies classified by spectral type us-\ning a principal component analysis. Although there is not\na one-to-one correspondence between colour and spectral\nclass, our red sample corresponds closely to their class 1\nand our blue sample to the combination of the remaining\nclasses 2, 3 and 4. The shape and normalization of our lumi-\nnosity functions agree well: the only difference occurs fainter\nthanMbJ > \u221216, where for the earliest spectral type, Madg-\nwick et al. (2002) find an excess over a Schechter function\nwhich is not apparent in our red sample. At first sight, the\nvalues of M\u2217 and hence the positions of the bright end of\nthe luminosity functions appear to differ. Madgwick et al.\n(2002) find that late type galaxies have significantly fainter\nM\u2217 than early types, while the bright ends of our blue and\nred luminosity functions are very close. This apparent dif-\nference is because Madgwick et al. correct their luminos-\nity functions to z = 0 while our estimates are for a fidu-\ncial redshift of z = 0.1. In addition, Madgwick et al. apply\nonly k-corrections while our modelling also includes mean e-\ncorrections for each class. Because the k + e corrections for\nthe red (early) galaxies are much greater than for the blue\n(late) galaxies this brings the M\u2217 values at z = 0.1 much\ncloser together. In fact, we find a very good match with the\nMadgwick et al. (2002) results once the difference in k + e\ncorrections is accounted for and the results translated to\nz = 0.1.\nWe also compare the overall luminosity function and\nmean k+e correction with the result of applying the method\nwe used previously in Norberg et al. (2002b). For this pur-\npose, we adopt k+e = (z+6z2)\/(1+8.9z2.5), which is shown\nby the long-dashed line in the lower panel of Fig. 5. This is\nessentially identical to the fit used in Norberg et al. (2002b).\nThe luminosity function estimated using the STY method,\nagain convolved with the same model for the magnitude er-\nrors, is shown by the long dashed line in the upper panel.\nWe note that apart from z < 0.05, where there are relatively\nfew 2dFGRS galaxies, this k+ e correction is in good agree-\nment with our new maximum likelihood estimate. Similarly,\nthe luminosity function is in quite close agreement with our\nnew estimate for the combined red and blue sample.\n3.1 Random unclustered catalogues\nArmed with realistic luminosity functions and evolution cor-\nrections, plus an accurate characterization of survey masks,\nwe can now generate corresponding random catalogues of\nunclustered galaxies (not to be confused with the RAN data\nfrom the randomly-placed 2dFGRS survey fields). The pro-\ncedure we adopt to do this is as described in Section 5 of\nNorberg et al. (2002b), except that we now have the op-\ntion of treating the red and blue subsamples separately. In\nthis procedure, we perturb the magnitude and redshifts in\naccordance with the known measurement errors. The mock\ncatalogues include a number of properties in addition to the\nangular position, apparent magnitude and redshift of each\ngalaxy:\n\u2022 The overall redshift completeness, ci, in the direction of\neach galaxy, as given by the completeness measure described\nin Section 2.3.\n\u2022 The mean expected galaxy number density ni at each\ngalaxy\u2019s position, taking account of the survey magnitude\nlimit in this direction, and the dependence of redshift com-\npleteness on apparent magnitude as characterized by the\nparameter \u00b5.\n\u2022 The expected bias parameter bi of a galaxy of a given\nluminosity and colour as defined by the simple model in\nSection 4.1.\nNote that when the red and blue subsamples are analysed\nseparately, ni refers only to galaxies of the same colour class,\nbut if the random catalogue is to be used in conjunction with\nthe full 2dFGRS catalogue, then ni is defined in terms of a\nsum over contributions from both the red and blue subsam-\nples. The value of this parameter will also vary if one places\nadditional cuts on the catalogue such as varying the faint\nmagnitude limit. As we shall see in Section 4.1, these quan-\ntities are useful when estimating the galaxy power spectrum.\nFig. 6 compares the redshift distribution of the genuine\n2dFGRS data with that of the random catalogues. The up-\nper panel shows the number of galaxies, binned by redshift,\nthat pass the selection criteria defining the samples used\nin the power spectrum analysis. The lower panel shows the\nsame distributions but weighted by the radial weight that\nis used in the power spectrum analysis. Figs 7 and 8 repeat\nthis comparison for the red and blue subsets. For the NGP\nand RAN fields the smooth redshift distributions of the ran-\ndom catalogues match quite accurately the mean values for\nthe full dataset and for the red and blue subsamples all the\nway to the maximum redshift of our samples (z = 0.3). The\n2dFGRS power spectrum 9\nFigure 6. The histograms in the top panel show the redshift\ndistribution of the 2dFGRS data in the SGP, NGP and RAN field\nregions. The curves show the distribution in the corresponding\nrandom unclustered catalogues. The lower panel shows the same\ndistributions, but weighted with a redshift dependent function as\nin the power spectrum analysis, using J3 = 400 h\u22123Mpc3. In all\ncases, the histograms for the random catalogues are normalized\nso that the sum of the weights matches that of the corresponding\ndata.\nFigure 7. As Fig. 6 but for the red subset with rest frame colours\nredder than (bJ \u2212 rF)z=0 > 1.07.\nSGP exhibits greater variation and in particular is under-\ndense compared to the random catalogue at z <\u223c 0.06. This\nlocal underdensity in the SGP has been noted and discussed\nmany times before (e.g. Maddox et al. 1990; Metcalfe, Fong\n& Shanks 1995; Frith et al. 2003; Busswell et al. 2004). In\ndiscussing the 2dFGRS 100k data, Norberg et al. (2002b)\ndemonstrated, in their figures 13 and 14, that similar red-\nFigure 8.As Fig. 6 but for the blue subset with rest frame colours\nbluer than (bJ \u2212 rF)z=0 < 1.07.\nshift distributions were not unexpected in \u039bCDM mock cat-\nalogues. Moreover, the lower panels in Figs 6, 7 and 8, which\nweight the galaxies in the same way as in the power spec-\ntrum analysis, indicate that the contribution from this local\nregion is negligible. With this weighting, it is the excess in\nthe SGP at 0.2 < z < 0.24 that appears more prominent.\nThis excess appears to be due to two large structures around\nRA = 23h and 2h. It is therefore likely that these excursions\nare due to genuine large scale structure. Nevertheless, in\nSection 6.6 we assess the sensitivity of our power spectrum\nestimate to the assumed redshift distribution by also con-\nsidering an empirical redshift distribution.\n4 POWER SPECTRUM ESTIMATION AND\nERROR ASSIGNMENT\n4.1 The power spectrum estimator\nWe employ the Fourier based method of Percival, Verde &\nPeacock (2004a; PVP) which is a generalization of the\nminimum variance method of Feldman, Kaiser & Peacock\n(1994; FKP) to the case where the galaxies have a known\nluminosity and\/or colour dependent bias. This procedure re-\nquires an assumed cosmological geometry in order to convert\nredshifts and positions on the sky to comoving distances in\nredshift space. Strictly, this geometry should vary with the\ncosmological model being tested. However, the effect of such\na change is very small (this was extensively tested in P01).\nWe have therefore simply assumed a cosmological model\nwith \u2126m = 0.3 and \u2126\u039b = 0.7 for this transition.\nIn our implementation, we carry out a summation over\ngalaxies from the data and random catalogues to evaluate\nthe weighted density field\nF (r) =\n1\nN\n\u222b\nw(r, L)\nb(L)\n[ngL(r, L)\u2212 \u03b1nrL(r, L)] dL (8)\non a cubic grid. Here ngL(r, L) and n\nr\nL(r, L) are the num-\n10 Cole et al.\nber density of galaxies of luminosity L to L + dL at posi-\ntion r in the data and random catalogues respectively. It is\nstraightforward to generalize this to include a summation\nover galaxies of different types or colours. Early analysis of\nthe 2dFGRS found a bias parameter of b \u2248 1 (Verde et\nal. 2002; Lahav et al. 2002) for L\u2217 galaxies averaged over\nall types. Subsequently we have determined that the bias\nparameter depends both on luminosity and galaxy type or\ncolour. Here we adopt a scale independent bias parameter\nb(L) = 0.85 + 0.15(L\/L\u2217), (9)\nas found by Norberg et al. (2001). For red and blue subsets,\nsplit by a rest frame colour of (bJ \u2212 rF)z=0 = 1.07, the bias\nis significantly different and we adopt\nbred = 1.3 [0.85 + 0.15(L\/L\u2217)] (10)\nand\nbblue = 0.9 [0.85 + 0.15(L\/L\u2217)], (11)\nwhich, as we find in Section 5.3, empirically describes the\ndifference in amplitudes of the power spectra of red and\nblue galaxies around k = 0.1 hMpc\u22121. Note that in all these\nformulae the L\u2217 refers to the Schechter function fit to the\noverall 2dFGRS luminosity function.\nThe minimum variance weighting function is given by\n(PVP)\nw(r, L) =\nb2(L)wA(r)\n1 + 4pi(J3\/b2T)\n\u222b\nb2(L\u2032) n\u00afgL(r, L\n\u2032) dL\u2032\n. (12)\nHere n\u00afgL(r, L\n\u2032) (\u2261 \u03b1n\u00afrL(r, L\u2032)) is the expected mean density\nof galaxies of luminosity L\u2032 at position r in the survey. Our\nstandard choice for J3 is 400 h\n\u22123Mpc3 and refers to the value\nfor typical galaxies in the weighted 2dFGRS, for which the\ntypical bias factor relative to that of L\u2217 galaxies is bT = 1.26.\nTo revert to the standard weighting function for the FKP\nestimator, we replace b(L) by bT. The weighting function,\nw(r, L), takes account of the galaxy luminosity function,\nvarying survey magnitude limits, varying completeness on\nthe sky and its dependence on apparent magnitude. The\nangular weight wA(r) has a mean of unity and gives a sta-\ntistical correction for missing close pairs of galaxies caused\nby fibre placing constraints (see Section 6.3 for details).\nThe factor \u03b1 in (8) is related to the ratio of the num-\nber of galaxies in the random catalogues to that in the real\ngalaxy catalogue. It is defined as\n\u03b1 =\n\u222b\u222b\nw(r,L)\nb(L)\nngL(r, L) dLd\n3r\u222b\u222b\nw(r,L)\nb(L)\nnrL(r, L) dLd\n3r\n, (13)\nwhich reduces to a sum over the real and random galaxies\n\u03b1 =\n\u2211\ndata\nwi\nbi\n\/ \u2211\nrandom\nwi\nbi\n. (14)\nSimilarly, the constantN in (8), which normalizes the survey\nwindow function, is defined as\nN2 \u2261\n\u222b [\u222b\nn\u00afgL(r, L)w(r, L)dL\n]2\nd3r, (15)\nwhich can be written as a sum over the random galaxies\nN2 = \u03b1\n\u2211\nrandom\nn\u00afgiw\n2\ni , (16)\nwhere n\u00afgi is the expected mean galaxy density at the position\nof the ith galaxy in the random catalogue. This quantity is\nevaluated and tabulated at the position of each galaxy so\nthat we can use this simple summation to evaluate N2.\nTo evaluate F (r) we loop over real and random galaxies,\ncalculate their spatial positions assuming a flat \u2126m = 0.3\ncosmology, and use cloud-in-cell assignment (e.g. Efstathiou\net al. 1985) to accumulate the difference in (wi\/bi)data \u2212\n\u03b1(wi\/bi)random on a grid. We first do this with a 256\n3 grid\nin a cubic box of L0box = 3125 h\n\u22121Mpc. Periodic boundary\nconditions are applied to map galaxies whose positions lie\noutside the box. To obtain estimates at smaller scales we\nrepeat this with 2563 grids of size Lbox = L\n0\nbox\/4, L\n0\nbox\/16.\nWe then use an FFT to Fourier transform these fields and\nexplicitly correct for the smoothing effect of the cloud-in-\ncell assignment (e.g. Hockney & Eastwood 1981, chap. 5).\nFrom each grid we retain only estimates for k < 0.63 kNyquist,\nwhere the correction for the effects of the grid are highly\naccurate. Thus, from the largest box we sample the power\nspectrum well on a 3D grid of spacing dk \u2243 0.002 hMpc\u22121\ncovering 0.002 < k < 0.16 hMpc\u22121. The smaller boxes give\na coarse sampling of the power spectrum with resolutions\nof dk = 0.008 and 0.032 hMpc\u22121 well into the non-linear\nregime 0.16 < k < 2.5hMpc\u22121, where our estimates become\nshot noise limited.\nThe shot noise corrected power spectrum estimator is\nP\u02c6 (k) = \u3008|F (k)|2\u3009 \u2212 Pshot, (17)\nwhere Pshot = S\/N\n2 with\nS \u2261\n\u2211\ndata\nw2i\nb2i\n+ \u03b12\n\u2211\nrandom\nw2i\nb2i\n. (18)\nFinally, we average the power over direction, in shells of fixed\n|k| in redshift space.\nThe power spectrum, P\u02c6 (k), is an estimate of the true\nunderlying galaxy power spectrum convolved with the power\nspectrum of the survey window function,\nW (r) =\n\u03b1\nN\n\u222b\nw(r, L)nrL(r, L) dL. (19)\nThus, to model our results we also need an accurate es-\ntimate of the window function. This we obtain using the\nsame techniques as above. The normalization is such that\u222b\nW 2(k) d3k = 1. Under the approximation that the un-\nderlying power spectrum is isotropic, i.e. ignoring redshift\ndistortions, then the operations of spherical averaging and\nconvolving commute. In Section 4.2.3 we test the effect of\nredshift distortions via direct Monte Carlo simulations us-\ning the Hubble volume mock catalogues described in Sec-\ntion 4.2.1. Thus, all that we require is a model of the spher-\nically averaged window function. The curve going through\nthe filled circles in Fig. 9 shows the window function that re-\nsults for our standard choice of data cuts and weights. The\nwindow function marked by the open circles results from\nremoving the random fields. This comparison shows that\nthe secondary peak in the window function of our standard\ndataset is due to the discrete random 2 degree fields. Also\nshown, as the dashed line, is the window function computed\nfor the smaller 100k sample in P01.\nWe use a 2-step process to compute the effect of this\nwindow on the recovered power spectrum. Firstly we inter-\npolate the measured window function using a cubic spline\n2dFGRS power spectrum 11\nFigure 9. The amplitude of the spherically averaged 2dFGRS\nwindow function of our standard weighted dataset in Fourier\nspace (filled circles). The solid line passing through these symbols\ngives a cubic spline (Press et al. 1992) fit to these data and was\nused to perform the spherical convolution of model power spec-\ntra. For comparison, we plot the window function and spline fit\nthat results from excluding the random fields (open circles). Also\nthe dashed line shows the fit used in Percival et al. (2001; P01),\nwhich ignores the structure in the window for k > 0.02hMpc\u22121.\n(Press et al. 1992); examples of these interpolated window\nfunctions are shown by the solid lines in Fig. 9. Secondly,\nwe use a modified Newton-Cotes integration scheme to per-\nform a spherical integration numerically using this fit and\ndetermine the k-distribution of power required for each data\npoint. This integration is performed once, with the result\nstored in a \u2018window matrix\u2019 giving the contribution from\neach of 1000 bins linearly spaced in 0 < k < 2hMpc\u22121 to\neach measured P (k) data point. We have performed numer-\nical integrations with fixed convergence limits for a number\nof power spectra, and find results similar to those calculated\nusing this matrix. The effect of the 2dFGRS window on the\nrecovered power is demonstrated in the next Section using\nmock catalogues.\n4.2 Mock catalogues\nTo determine the statistical error in our power spectrum\nestimates and also to test our codes thoroughly, we employ\ntwo sets of mock catalogues.\n4.2.1 Hubble volume mocks\nThe first set of mock catalogues are based on the \u039bCDM\nHubble Volume cosmological N-body simulation (Evrard et\nal. 2002). The Hubble Volume simulation contained 109 par-\nticles in a box of comoving size Lbox = 3000 h\n\u22121Mpc with\ncosmological parameters h = 0.7, \u2126m = 0.3, \u2126\u039b = 0.7, \u2126b =\n0.04 and \u03c38 = 0.9 . The galaxies are biased with respect to\nthe mass. This is achieved by computing the local density, \u03b4s,\nsmoothed with a Gaussian of width rs = 2h\n\u22121Mpc, around\neach particle in the simulation and selecting the particle to\nbe a galaxy with a probability\nP (\u03b4\ns\n) \u221d\n{\nexp(0.45 \u03b4s \u2212 0.14 \u03b43\/2s ) \u03b4s \u2265 0\nexp(0.45 \u03b4s) \u03b4s < 0\n(20)\n(Cole et al. 1998). The constants in this expression were\nchosen to produce a galaxy correlation function matching\nthat of typical galaxies in the 2dFGRS. This can be seen\nin figure 6 of Hawkins et al. (2003) as in this analysis of\nthe 2dFGRS correlation function we used the same set of 22\nmock catalogues. They were also used in the analysis of the\ndependence of the correlation function on galaxy type and\nluminosity (Norberg et al. 2001, 2002a) and when analysing\nhigher order counts in cells statistics (Baugh et al. 2004;\nCroton et al. 2004).\nThe attractive features of the Hubble Volume mocks are\nthat their clustering properties are a good match to that of\n2dFGRS and that they are fully non-linear: their density\nfield is appropriately non-Gaussian and they have realistic\nlevels of redshift space distortion. The limitations are that\nthey lack luminosity or colour dependent clustering and that\nthe 22 simulations are too few to determine the power covari-\nance matrix accurately. We could generate more catalogues,\nbut given the finite volume of the Hubble Volume simula-\ntion this would be of little value as they are not strictly\nindependent.\n4.2.2 Log-normal mocks\nFor an accurate determination of the covariance matrix of\nour power spectrum estimates, we need sets of mock cata-\nlogues with of order 1000 realizations. In P01, we achieved\nthis by generating realizations of Gaussian random fields.\nHere, we slightly improve on this method by generating\nfields of a specified power spectrum with a log-normal 1-\npoint distribution function. The log-normal model (Coles &\nJones 1991) is known to match both the results of large\nscale structure simulations (Kayo, Taruya & Suto 2001)\nand agree empirically with 1-point distribution function of\nthe 2dFGRS galaxy density field on large scales (Wild et al.\n2005). The power spectrum we adopted for these mocks was\ngenerated using the Eisenstein & Hu (1998) algorithm with\ncosmological parameters \u2126mh = 0.168 and \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17.\nThe normalization we chose corresponds to \u03c3gal8 = 0.89 for\nL\u2217 galaxies and \u03c3\ngal\n8 = 1.125 for the typical galaxy in our\nweighted 2dFGRS catalogue. The method for constructing\nthe log-normal field and random galaxy catalogue is similar\nto that described by PVP.\nWe generate a log-normal field with the required power\nspectrum in a cuboid aligned with the principal axes of\nthe 2dFGRS. We have chosen to use a cuboid of dimen-\nsions 3125 \u00d7 1565.25 \u00d7 3125 h\u22121Mpc covered by a grid of\n512\u00d7256\u00d7512 cubic cells. To convert this field into a mock\ncatalogue we simply loop over all the galaxies in our random\ncatalogue, determine which cell they occupy (applying peri-\nodic boundary conditions if necessary) and select the galaxy\naccording to a Poisson probability distribution. The mean\nof the Poisson distribution is modulated by the amplitude\nof the log-normal field and normalized to achieve the right\noverall number of galaxies in the mock catalogue.\n12 Cole et al.\nFigure 10. Comparison of the recovered and input power spectra\nfor a set of log-normal mocks. The two curves in the upper panel\nshow the model input power spectrum (dashed) and its convolu-\ntion with the window function of the catalogue (solid). The mean\nrecovered power spectrum from a set of 1000 mocks and the rms\nscatter about this mean are shown by the points and error bars.\nIn the lower panel, instead of using a logarithmic scale we plot,\non a linear scale, the ratio of the three power spectra of the top\npanel to a reference model with \u2126mh = 0.2 and \u2126b = 0. The line\ntypes and symbols have the same meaning as in the upper panel.\nThese catalogues are computationally cheap, so we can\ngenerate sufficient realizations to determine the power co-\nvariance matrix accurately. Also, by modulating the rms\namplitude of the log-normal field we can build in luminos-\nity and colour dependent clustering. Their limitations are\nthat they are restricted to quite large scales, the level of\nnon-Gaussianity is not necessarily realistic and they have\nno redshift space distortion. We assess these shortcomings\nby comparison to the Hubble Volume mocks.\n4.2.3 Analysis of mock catalogues\nWe now apply the method for estimating the power spec-\ntrum, described in Section 4.1, to our two sets of mock cat-\nalogues. This exercise allows us to test our code, illustrate\nthe effect of the window function and assess the level of sys-\ntematic error that results from ignoring the anisotropy of\nthe redshift space power spectrum.\nFig. 10 compares power spectrum estimates from the\nlog-normal mocks with the input power spectrum. These\nmocks have clustering that depends on luminosity accord-\nFigure 11. Comparison of the expected and recovered power\nspectra for the Hubble Volume mock catalogues. For mocks con-\nstructed using both real-space and redshift-space galaxy posi-\ntions, we compare the input non-linear power spectrum (curves)\nwith the mean recovered power spectrum (error bars). Unlike\nFig. 10, the error bars here indicate the error in the mean recov-\nered power, computed assuming the 22 mocks to be independent.\nThe lower panel shows, on a linear scale, these same two power\nspectra but divided by the same reference model as in Fig. 10\nwith \u2126mh = 0.2 and \u2126b = 0. Also shown as filled circles in the\nlower panel is the estimated power from the 22 mock catalogues\nin redshift space but after applying the cluster collapsing algo-\nrithm. These match the redshift-space estimates on large scales\nbut have more power on small scales.\ning to equation 9 and are analysed using the PVP method\nassuming the same dependence of bias parameter on lumi-\nnosity. The dashed curve shows the intrinsic input power\nspectrum and the solid curve the result of convolving it with\nthe survey window function. In the lower panel one sees that\nthe baryon oscillations present in the input power spectrum\nare greatly suppressed by the convolution with the window\nfunction. The points with error bars show the mean recov-\nered power spectrum and the rms scatter about the mean\nfor a set of 1000 mocks. We see that for k < 0.4 hMpc\u22121 the\nmean recovered power is in excellent agreement with the con-\nvolved input spectrum. In particular, there is no perceptible\nglitch in the recovered power at k = 0.16 hMpc\u22121 where\nwe switch between the 3125 and 781.25 h\u22121Mpc boxes used\nfor the FFTs. The PVP method has correctly recovered the\ninput power spectrum with no biases due to the luminosity\ndependence of the clustering. At the edge of the plots, as\n2dFGRS power spectrum 13\nwe approach the Nyquist frequency, kny = 0.51 hMpc\n\u22121, of\nthe grid on which the log-normal field was generated, the\nrecovered power begins to deviate significantly from input\npower. For k > 0.4 hMpc\u22121 our log-normal mocks are of\nlimited value.\nFig. 11 compares the recovered power spectra with the\nexpected values for three sets of Hubble Volume mocks. As\nthe bias is independent of luminosity for these samples, the\npower spectrum estimator we use is equivalent to the FKP\nmethod. In the first set of mocks, redshift space distortions\nwere eliminated by placing the galaxies at the their real\nspace positions. Here, the power spectrum is isotropic (as in\nthe log-normal mocks) and again we expect, and find, that\nthe recovered power spectrum accurately matches the exact\nnon-linear spectrum from the full Hubble Volume, convolved\nwith the survey window function. The error bars shown on\nthis plot are the errors in the mean power. The rms error\nfor an individual catalogue will be\n\u221a\n21 times larger, compa-\nrable to the error bars in Fig. 10. The second set of points\nin Fig. 11 are the Hubble Volume mocks constructed using\nthe galaxy redshift space positions. These are compared to\nthe expectation computed by taking the spherically aver-\naged redshift space power spectrum from the full simulation\ncube and convolving with the window function. We see that\nover the range of scales plotted, the recovered power agrees\nwell with this expectation. This indicates that ignoring the\nanisotropy when fitting models will not introduce a signifi-\ncant bias.\nIn the third set of Hubble Volume mocks, groups and\nclusters were identified in the redshift space mock catalogues\nusing the same friends-of-friends algorithm and parameters\nthat Eke et al. (2004) used to define the 2PIGG catalogue of\n2dFGRS groups and clusters. Each group member was then\nshifted to the mean group redshift perturbed according to\na Gaussian random distribution with width corresponding\nto the projected group size. This has the effect of collapsing\nthe clusters along the redshift space direction, removing the\n\u2018fingers of god\u2019 and making the small scale clustering much\nless anisotropic. In the lower panel of Fig. 11 we see that,\non large scales, this procedure has no effect on the recovered\npower. In contrast, on small scales the smoothing effect of\nthe random velocities of galaxies in groups and clusters is re-\nmoved and the recovered power spectrum has a shape much\ncloser to that of the real space mocks. In Section 8 we will\ncompare the results of analyzing the genuine 2dFGRS data\nin redshift space with and without this cluster collapsing\nalgorithm.\n5 FINAL 2dFGRS RESULTS\nFig. 12 shows the application of the above machinery to the\n2dFGRS data for our default choice of selection cuts, weights\nand model of the selection function. The error bars on this\nplot come from a set of log-normal mocks selected, weighted\nand analysed in the same way. The model power spectrum\nof these mocks, shown by the curve, has \u2126mh = 0.168,\n\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17 and \u03c3\ngal\n8 = 0.89 and closely matches what\nwe recover from the 2dFGRS. The shaded region shows as\nan alternative a jack-knife estimate of the power spectrum\nerrors.

In the lower\npanel, where we have again divided through by an unrealistic reference model with \u2126mh = 0.2 and \u2126b = 0, we show both the log-normal\nestimate of the errors (error bars) and an alternative error estimate based on jack-knife resampling of the 2dFGRS data (shaded region).\nNote that the window function, shown in Fig. 9, causes the data points to be correlated.\n2dFGRS power spectrum 15\nFigure 13. Comparison of the power spectrum estimate from P01 with our current estimates. To compare the amplitude of the new PVP\nand old FKP estimates, we have scaled the FKP estimate by a factor \u3008b\u22122\u3009 (the weighted average value of the bias factor appearing in\nequation 8). The left hand panel shows each power spectrum estimate divided by a reference power spectrum with parameters \u2126mh = 0.2\nand \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0. In the right hand panel the reference power spectrum has \u2126mh = 0.168,\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17, and is convolved with the\nwindow function of the final or February 2001 data as appropriate.

The triangles show the P01 estimate and the open circles show an estimate using only the pre-February 2001\ndata but our current calibration and modelling of the survey selection function.\nexceed that of the linear theory model. This is due to non-\nlinearity which we discuss in Section 7. These power spectra\nand error estimates are tabulated in Table 2 3. We show in\nSection 6 that this power-spectrum estimate is robust with\nrespect to variations in how the dataset is treated and we\nfit models to these data in Section 8.\n5.1 Comparison with Percival et al. (2001)\nIn Fig. 13 we compare our new power spectrum estimate\nwith that from P01. There are significant differences in the\nshape of the recovered power spectrum on scales larger than\nk < 0.1 hMpc\u22121, but this is largely due to the difference\nin the window function. In the right hand panel, where this\nhas been factored out, the old and new estimates only be-\ngin to differ significantly for k < 0.04 hMpc\u22121. The main\nreason for this difference is sample variance. The estimate\nshown by the open circles is based on the same dataset as the\nP01 estimate, but uses the updated calibration, modelling of\nthe selection function and PVP estimator described in this\npaper. Our current model of the survey selection function\ndiffers in many details from that used in P01, but in general\nthese differences make very little difference to the recov-\nered power. The two differences that cause a non-negligible\nchange are the improvement in photometric calibration and\nthe empirical fitted model of the redshift distribution.

For\nthe case of the final data set this is discussed in Sections 6.1\nand 6.6 and shown in Figs 17d and n.\n5.2 Dependence on luminosity\nThe power spectrum we measure comes from combining\ngalaxies of different types, whose clustering properties may\nbe different. We now complete the presentation of the basic\nresults from the survey by dissecting the power spectrum\naccording to galaxy luminosity and colour.\nFig. 14 shows the power spectrum estimated as de-\nscribed in Section 4.1, but for galaxies in fixed bins of ab-\nsolute magnitude. Because the 2dFGRS catalogue is lim-\nited in apparent magnitude, each of these power spectrum\nmeasurements will have a different window function; how-\never, we can consider the effect of the window on each\npower spectrum approximately by dividing the recovered\nP (k) by the appropriately convolved version of a CDM\nmodel that fits the large-scale combined P (k). The power\nspectra have been renormalized to a common large-scale\n(0.02 < k < 0.08 hMpc\u22121) amplitude.\nThe luminosity-dependent spectra show differences at\nlarge and small scales. The variations at k <\n\u223c\n0.1 hMpc\u22121\nare cosmic variance: the different redshift distributions cor-\nresponding to different luminosity slices implies that the\nsamples are close to independent. Using the separate covari-\nance matrices for these samples, a \u03c72 comparison shows that\nthe large-scale variations are as expected. The differences at\nhigh k, however, reflect genuine differences in the non-linear\n16 Cole et al.\nFigure 14. The various lines show recovered power spectra from\n2dFGRS galaxies split into different bins of absolute magnitude\n(in redshift space \u2013 top panel and cluster-collapsed \u2013 bottom\npanel). The power spectra have been divided by a reference model\nwith \u2126mh = 0.168 and \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17, convolved with the win-\ndow function corresponding to each data cut. We have illustrated\nstatistical errors estimated from log-normal mocks by showing the\n\u00b11\u03c3 range for two of the samples by the corresponding shaded\nregions.\nclustering and\/or pairwise velocity dispersions as a function\nof luminosity. We discuss below in Section 7 how these sys-\ntematic differences affect our ability to extract cosmological\ninformation from the 2dFGRS.\n5.3 Dependence on colour\nIn Fig. 15, we show estimates of the galaxy power spectrum\nfor the two samples defined by splitting the catalogue at a\nrest frame colour of (bJ \u2212 rF)z=0 = 1.07. As the redshift\ndistribution of the blue sample is more extended than that\nof the red, the optimal PVP weighting for the blue sam-\nple weights the volume at high redshift more strongly. Since\nwe wish to compare the shapes of the red and blue power\nspectra it would be preferable if they sampled the same vol-\nume. Hence, when analyzing the blue sample, we have cho-\nsen to apply an additional redshift dependent weight, so as\nto force the mean weight per unit redshift to be the same\nfor both samples. The estimates were made using the PVP\nestimator and the bias parameters defined in equations (10)\nand (11). However, to illustrate that at fixed luminosity the\nFigure 15. Power spectrum for matched red and blue galaxy\nsubsamples. The symbols and error bars in the upper panel show\nour estimates with errors derived from the log-normal mocks.\nFor reference, the solid curves show the linear power spectrum\nused for the log-normal mocks, which has \u2126mh = 0.168 and\n\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17. In each case, the model power spectra are normal-\nized according to the bias parameters defined in equations (10)\nand (11) and convolved with the window function of the sam-\nple. The lower panel shows the relative bias, the square root of\nthe ratio of these power spectra. The error bars, determined from\nour mock catalogues, take account of the correlation induced by\nthe fact the red and blue subsamples sample the same volume.\nThe horizontal line in the lower panel shows the expectation for\nscale independent bias given by the ratio of b(L\u2217) for the adopted\nred and blue bias factors from equations (10) and (11). The solid\ncurves show the ratio that would result if the red and blue galax-\nies had power spectra that were well described by linear theory\nmodels whose values of \u2126mh differed by 0.01, 0.02 or 0.03 from\ntop to bottom on large scales.\nred galaxies are more clustered than the blue galaxies we\nhave multiplied each estimate by their respective values of\nb(L\u2217)\n2, where L\u2217 is the characteristic luminosity of the full\ngalaxy sample. To first order, we see that the two power\nspectra have very similar shapes, with both becoming more\nclustered than the linear theory model on small scales.\nThe lower panel shows the relative bias, brel(k) \u2261\u221a\nPred(k)\/Pblue(k), as a function of scale. On large scales,\nthis relative bias is consistent with a constant and is, by con-\nstruction, close to the value given by the ratio of the adopted\nbias parameters of equations (10) and (11) shown by the hor-\nizontal dashed line. In fact, for k < 0.12 hMpc\u22121, fitting a\n2dFGRS power spectrum 17\nFigure 16. The redshift-space power spectrum calculated in this paper (solid circles with 1-\u03c3 errors shown by the shaded region)\ncompared with other measurements of the 2dFGRS power spectrum shape by a) Percival et al. (2001), b) Percival (2005), and c)\nTegmark et al. (2002). For the data with window functions, the effect of the window has been approximately corrected by multiplying\nby the net effect of the window on a model power spectrum with \u2126mh = 0.168, \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.0, h = 0.72 & ns = 1. A zero-baryon model\nwas chosen in order to avoid adding features into the power spectrum. All of the data are renormalized to match the new measurements.\nPanel d) shows the uncorrelated SDSS real space P (k) estimate of Tegmark et al. (2004), calculated using their \u2018modelling method\u2019 with\nno FOG compression (their Table 3). These data have been corrected for the SDSS window as described above for the 2dFGRS data.\nThe solid line shows a model linear power spectrum with \u2126mh = 0.168, \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17, h = 0.72, ns = 1 and normalization matched to\nthe 2dFGRS power spectrum.\nconstant bias using the full covariance matrix produces a fit\nwith \u03c72 = 25.5 for 25 degrees of freedom. We note that this\nvalue of the bias, bred\/bblue = 1.44 is in very good agreement\nwith the bpassive\/bactive = 1.45 \u00b1 0.14 found in section 3.3\nof Madgwick et al. (2003), when analysing the correlation\nfunction of spectrally classified 2dFGRS galaxies. The value\nalso agrees well with that found in the halo model analysis of\nred and blue 2dFGRS galaxies by Collister & Lahav (2005).\nAt smaller scales, there is an increasingly significant devi-\nation, with the red galaxies being more clustered than the\nblue (in agreement with Madgwick et al. 2003). Also shown\nin the lower panel are curves indicating the relative bias that\nwould result if the red and blue power spectra were well fit-\nted by linear theory models whose values of \u2126mh differed\nby 0.01, 0.02 or 0.03. From this we see that a simple fit of\nlinear theory to the red and blue samples would yield values\nof \u2126mh that differ by \u2206\u2126mh \u2243 0.015. This small difference\nis comparable to the statistical uncertainty. In any case, in\nSection 7 we discuss systematic nonlinear corrections to the\npower, and show how a robust measurement of \u2126mh can\nbe achieved even in the presence of small distortions of the\nspectrum.\n5.4 Comparison with other power spectra\nIn Fig. 16, we compare the power spectrum measured in this\npaper with previous estimates of the shape of the power\nspectrum on large-scales measured from the 2dFGRS and\n18 Cole et al.\nSDSS. In addition to the data of Percival et al. (2001),\nwith which we compared in detail in Section 5.1, we ad-\nditionally plot the data of Percival (2005) who extracted\nthe real-space power spectrum from the 2dFGRS. In that\nwork, Markov-chain Monte-Carlo mapping of the likelihood\nsurface was used to deconvolve the power spectrum from\na Spherical Harmonics decomposition presented in Percival\net al. (2004b). Because of the method used, a cut-down ver-\nsion of the final 2dFGRS catalogue was analysed with a\nradial selection function that was independent of angular\nposition. Consequently, the volume analysed is smaller, and\nthis method provides weaker constraints on the power spec-\ntrum shape. However, we see from Fig. 16b that the general\nshape of the recovered power spectrum is very similar over\n0.02 < k < 0.15 hMpc\u22121, the range of scales probed in Per-\ncival (2004b).\nIn Fig. 16c we plot the power spectrum measured by\nTegmark et al. (2002) from the 2dFGRS 100k data release.\nBecause of the weighting scheme they used, these data are\nexpected to be tilted relative to the true power spectrum\nbecause of luminosity-dependent bias. The plot shows evi-\ndence for such a bias and the Tegmark et al. (2002) data\nhave a lower amplitude on large scales than any of the other\n2dFGRS P (k) measurements. Given the small sample anal-\nysed, these data provide a far weaker constraint on the power\nspectrum shape than our current analysis.\nIn addition to the 2dFGRS power spectrum measure-\nments described above, we also plot in Fig. 16d the re-\ncent estimate from the SDSS by Tegmark et al. (2004).\nThis analysis differed from the analysis of the 2dFGRS by\nTegmark et al. (2002) by including a crude correction for\nluminosity-dependent bias, which corrects for an amplitude\noffset for each data point, but does not allow for the chang-\ning survey volume (Percival et al. 2004a). The SDSS work\nquotes a somewhat larger value of \u2126mh than that found\nhere: 0.213 \u00b1 0.023, which is formally a 1.6 \u2212 \u03c3 deviation.\nHowever, this SDSS figure assumes a known baryon fraction,\nwhich makes the error on \u2126mh unrealistically low. As can\nbe seen from Fig. 16d, the basic shapes of the 2dFGRS and\nSDSS galaxy power spectra in fact agree remarkably well.\nWe have chosen not to compare with galaxy power spec-\ntrum estimates obtained from surveys prior to the 2dFGRS,\nor calculated by deprojecting 2D surveys because the 2dF-\nGRS and SDSS data offer a significant improvement over\nthese data. However, we do note that the general shape of\nour estimate of the power spectrum is very similar to that\nobtained in such studies (e.g. Efstathiou & Moody 2001;\nPadilla & Baugh 2003; Ballinger, Heavens & Taylor 1995;\nTadros et al. 1999).\n6 TESTS OF SYSTEMATICS\nGiven the cosmological significance of the 2dFGRS power\nspectrum estimates, it is important to be confident that the\nresults presented in the previous Section are robust, and\nnot sensitive to particular assumptions made in the analy-\nsis. This Section presents a comprehensive investigation into\npotential sources of systematic error in the final result.\nOur default set of assumptions in modelling and ana-\nlyzing the 2dFGRS data are:\n(i) Our standard choice for the photometric calibration of\nthe catalogue is essentially that of the final data release (Col-\nless et al. 2003) but with small shifts of \u22120.0125 and 0.022\nmag. applied to the NGP and SGP respectively to bring\ntheir estimated luminosity functions into precise agreement.\n(ii) We combine data from the NGP and SGP strips and\nalso the RAN fields.\n(iii) We model the galaxy population by a single\nSchechter luminosity function and k + e correction as de-\nscribed in Section 3 and shown in Fig. 5. Magnitude mea-\nsurement errors are then applied using the empirical model\nof Norberg et al. (2002b see their figure 3f).\n(iv) Incompleteness in the redshift survey is modelled in\nthe mock catalogues using a combination of the mean com-\npleteness in each sector R(\u03b8) (Fig. 3) and its dependence on\napparent magnitude as parameterized by \u00b5(\u03b8) (Fig. 4; see\nColless et al. 2001 Section 8 and appendix A of Norberg et\nal. 2002b for details).\n(v) We discard data from sectors with redshift complete-\nness R(\u03b8) < 0.1.\n(vi) We impose a maximum redshift of zmax = 0.3 .\n(vii) We use the PVP estimator with the bias parameter\ngiven by equation 9.\n(viii) We use angular weights that attempt to correct for\nmissed close pairs due to fibre collisions and positioning con-\nstraints. Their construction is explained in Section 6.3.\n(ix) We use the radial weighting given by equation (12)\nwith J3 = 400h\n\u22123Mpc3.\nIn Fig. 17, the left hand panels show the ratio of es-\ntimated power spectra to an (unrealistic) reference model\npower spectrum with \u2126mh = 0.2 and \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0. These\npanels allow one to see the effect of our modelling assump-\ntions on the shape and amplitude of the recovered power\nspectrum. However, part of this variation will be due to\nhow the survey window function changes when we modify\nthe weighting or selection cuts. Thus, the right hand panels\nshow the same power spectra, but divided instead by the re-\nalistic model with \u2126mh = 0.168 and \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17 that was\nused for the log-normal mocks, but now taking into account\nthe correct window function for each dataset. Unless stated\notherwise, no adjustments are made to the normalization of\nthe power spectrum estimates.\nThe top panels of Fig. 17 show the estimated power\nspectrum for the full 2dFGRS for the standard choices listed\nabove. The error bars are those we estimate from the log-\nnormal mock catalogues. In the subsequent panels of Fig. 17,\nwe show the effects of varying these assumptions.\n6.1 Photometric calibration\nOver the years the earlier calibrations of the APM photo-\ngraphic plates have been the source of much debate (e.g.\nMetcalfe, Fong & Shanks 1995; Busswell et al. 2004). Thus\nit is important to try and quantify at what level uncertain-\nties in the photometry have an impact on our ability to\nmeasure the galaxy power spectrum.\nResults of four different calibrations are shown in\nFigs 17c and d. As described in Section 2.1, our standard\nchoice (standard) differs from the final 2dFGRS calibration\n(final) by the small offsets that we apply to the NGP and\nSGP regions so as to bring their luminosity functions into\ngood agreement. We see that these offsets cause very lit-\n2dFGRS power spectrum 19\nFigure 17. Test power spectra calculated for different data cuts and assumptions. The data are divided by a reference power spectrum.\nIn the left hand column, the reference power spectrum has parameters \u2126mh = 0.2 and \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0. In the right hand column, the\nreference power spectrum has \u2126mh = 0.168,\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.17 (as used for the log-normal mock catalogues), and is convolved with the\ncorrect window function (which varies with data cuts and weighting scheme). The top row shows the power spectrum estimate and\nassociated statistical errors resulting from our standard choices of data cuts and weighting. Subsequent rows give results for different\ntests, as described in Section 6.\n20 Cole et al.\nFigure 17 \u2013 continued\n2dFGRS power spectrum 21\ntle change in the recovered power spectrum. We also show\nresults for the older calibration from the preliminary 100k\ndata release (100k) (Colless et al. 2001). Here, the sys-\ntematic shift in the recovered power spectrum is somewhat\nlarger, but as the size of the error bars in the upper panels\nshow the shift is never larger than the statistical error. If\nwe had used this calibration, then the maximum likelihood\nvalue of \u2126mh inferred in Section 8 would have been reduced\nby 0.01 and the baryon fraction \u2126b\/\u2126m increased by 0.04.\nThese shifts are almost equal to the 1\u2212 \u03c3 statistical errors\nin these quantities.\nFor the last calibration model shown in Figs 17c and d,\nwe take a novel approach and first calibrate each photo-\ngraphic plate without the use of external photometric data.\nThe magnitudes in the final released catalogue, bJ\nfinal and\nmagnitudes, bJ\nself , resulting from this self-calibration are\nassumed to be related by a quasilinear relation\nbJ\nself = aself bJ\nfinal + bself . (21)\nThe calibration coefficients aself and bself are allowed to\nvary from plate to plate. To set the values of these cal-\nibration coefficients two constraints are applied. First, on\neach plate we assume that the galaxy luminosity function\ncan be represented by a Schechter function with faint-end\nslope \u03b1 = \u22121.2 and make a maximum likelihood estimate of\nM\u2217. The value of M\u2217 is sensitive to the difference in bJ\nself\nand bJ\nfinal at around bJ = 17.5 and the number of galax-\nies on each plate is such that the typical random error on\nM\u2217 is 0.03 magnitudes. Second, we compare the number of\ngalaxies, N(z > 0.25), with redshifts greater than z = 0.25\nwith the number we expect, Nmodel(z > 0.25), based on our\nstandard model of the survey selection function. The value\nof Nmodel(z > 0.25) depends sensitively on the survey mag-\nnitude limit and so constrains the difference in bJ\nself and\nbJ\nfinal at bJ \u2243 19.5. By demanding that on each plate both\nN(z > 0.25) = Nmodel(z > 0.25) andM\u2217\u22125 log h \u2261 \u221219.73,\nwe determine aself and bself . Note that this method of cali-\nbrating the catalogue is extreme. It ignores the information\navailable in the plate overlaps and ignores the CCD cali-\nbrating data (apart from setting the overall arbitrary zero\npoint of M\u2217 \u2212 5 log h = \u221219.73). Nevertheless, we see that\nthis (self) and the default (standard) calibration results in\nonly a very small shift in the recovered power spectrum. The\ncorresponding shifts in the inferred cosmological model pa-\nrameters \u2126mh and baryon fraction \u2126b\/\u2126m are \u22120.006 and\n0.02 respectively. These shifts are small compared to the\ncorresponding statistical errors.\nWe conclude from these comparisons that the final 2dF-\nGRS photometric calibration is more accurate than the pre-\nliminary 100k calibration and the residual systematic un-\ncertainties are at a level that they have negligible impact on\nthe accuracy of the recovered galaxy power spectrum.\n6.2 Redshift incompleteness\nIn Figs 17e and f, we investigate the effect of varying the\ntreatment of incompleteness in the redshift survey. As de-\nscribed above, our default choice is to keep all sectors of the\nsurvey with a completeness R(\u03b8) > 0.1 and use the com-\npleteness maps shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 to reproduce this\nin the random catalogues. In Figs 17e and f, we show the ef-\nfect of using the much more stringent cut R(\u03b8) > 0.5 and so\nremoving the tail of low completeness sectors that are visible\nin Fig. 3. These are mainly around the edges of the survey\nwhere constraints on observing time meant that overlapping\nfields were never observed. This has a very small, but mea-\nsurable effect on the P (k) shown in Fig. 17e, but once the\neffect of the changed window function is accounted for, no\nperceptible difference remains in Fig. 17f.\nAlso shown in these panels is the effect of ignoring the\napparent magnitude dependence of the incompleteness by\nsetting \u00b5 = \u221e when constructing our random catalogues.\nAgain, there is negligible effect, clearly demonstrating that\nthe accuracy of the 2dFGRS galaxy power spectrum is not\naffected by uncertainty in the incompleteness.\n6.3 Angular weight\nIn Figs 17g and h, we show the effect of varying the angular\nweights which compensate for redshifts that are missed due\nto fibre collisions. Our default choice of the angular weights,\nwA, that attempt to correct for missing close pairs, are de-\nfined by a multi-step process. We assign unit weight to all\nobjects in the 2dFGRS parent catalogue, then loop over the\nsubset that lack measured redshifts and redistribute their\nweight to their 10 nearest neighbours with redshifts. The\nangular weights, wA, are then defined by multiplying these\nweights by R(\u03b8) and explicitly normalizing them to have\nan overall mean of unity. The inclusion of the R(\u03b8) factor\nmeans that the overall weight assigned to a given sector is\nproportional to the number of galaxies in that sector with\nmeasured redshifts, rather than to the number in the parent\ncatalogue. The estimate labelled \u2018assumed random\u2019 instead\nhas wA \u2261 1 and so no correction is made for missing close\npairs other than their contribution to the overall complete-\nness of a given sector, i.e. within a sector the missing galax-\nies are assumed to be a random subset. We see that, on the\nscale of interest, correcting for the missing close pairs has a\nnegligible effect.\nFor the estimate labelled \u2018parent\u2019 we omit the factor\nR(\u03b8) in the construction of the angular weights for the main\nNGP and SGP strips. This has the effect of up-weighting\nregions with low completeness so that each sector has a\nweight proportional to the number of galaxies in the par-\nent catalogue. Hence the angular dependence of the window\nfunction that is due to varying redshift incompleteness is re-\nmoved. Figs 17g and h show that even for this very different\nweighting, the change in the recovered power spectrum is\nextremely small.\n6.4 Radial weight\nIn Figs 17i and j, we investigate the effect of varying the\nradial weighting function. We show the result of using equa-\ntion 12 with J3 = 300, 400 and 500h\n\u22123Mpc3. The choice of\nweighting alters the effective window function and so there\nis some variation in the left hand panel on the very largest\nscales, but in the right hand panel, where this is factored\nout, there is very little variation in the recovered power.\nFor each of these values of J3, we generated a set of 1000\nlog-normal mocks and compared the statistical error in the\nrecovered power, measured from the rms scatter in the in-\ndividual estimates. This exercise explicitly verified that the\n22 Cole et al.\nvalue J3 \u2243 400 h\u22123Mpc3, that we adopt as a default, is close\nto optimal in terms of giving a minimal variance estimate of\nthe power.\nThe weighting function, equation 12, depends not only\non redshift, but also on angular position through the angular\ndependence of the quantity n\u00afgL. That is, it takes account of\nthe variation in the expected galaxy number density due\nto angular variation of redshift incompleteness and survey\nmagnitude limit. The estimates labelled \u2018P01\u2019 use instead a\npurely redshift dependent weight of\nw = (1.0 + 100\/[1 + (z\/0.12)3 ]2)\u22121 (22)\nas was done in Percival et al. (2001). On average, this is close\nto our J3 = 400h\n\u22123Mpc3 weighting. It slightly modifies the\nwindow function, but once this is factored out we see, in\nFig. 17j, that there is little effect on the recovered power.\n6.5 Redshift limit\nIn Figs 17k and l, we reduce the redshift limit from 0.3 to\n0.25. This alters the window function and so has an effect\non the power plotted in the left hand panel, but in the right\nhand panel, where this is corrected for, the variation is mini-\nmal. The accurate agreement here is reassuring and indicates\nthere are no problems in pushing the survey and the model\nof its selection function to the full volume that it probes.\n6.6 Luminosity function and evolution\nIn Figs 17m and n, we investigate the uncertainty in the\nrecovered power induced by the uncertainty involved in the\nradial selection function of the survey. Our default determi-\nnation of the 2dFGRS selection function involves modelling\nthe galaxy luminosity function as a single Schechter luminos-\nity function and the evolution by a single k + e correction\n(magnitude measurement errors are also included). These\nare derived empirically by the maximum likelihood method\npresented in Section 3. This \u2018standard\u2019 model is compared\nwith the result of using a \u20182 population\u2019 model with indi-\nvidual luminosity functions and k+ e corrections for the red\nand blue galaxy populations. Again, the luminosity func-\ntions and k + e corrections used are the empirically deter-\nmined ones presented in Section 3. We see that adding these\nextra degrees of freedom to the description of the galaxy\npopulation has a negligible effect on the recovered power.\nAs a separate test, we show the results (labelled\n\u2018colours\u2019) of a single population model in which the mean\nk+e correction has been determined using Bruzual & Char-\nlot (1993) stellar population models matched to the galaxy\ncolours as was done in Norberg et al. (2002b). This model\nagain produces highly consistent results, which is perhaps\nnot surprising given that its k+e correction, shown in Fig. 5,\nis quite similar to the one found by the maximum likelihood\nmethod.\nThe three radial selection function models discussed\nabove produce consistent results, but all make common as-\nsumptions such as Schechter function forms for the lumi-\nnosity functions and smooth k + e corrections. To demon-\nstrate that these assumptions are not artificially distorting\nour estimate of the power, we present results for an alter-\nnative empirical model of the redshift distribution. For this,\nwe compare the observed redshift distribution averaged over\nthe whole survey with that of our standard model. The two\nredshift distributions are shown in the top panel of Fig. 6.\nWe then resample our default random catalogues so that\nthe redshift distribution of the remaining galaxies exactly\nmatches that of the data. In this process we also correspond-\ningly modify the tabulated galaxy number densities in the\nrandom catalogue so that our power spectrum estimator re-\nmains correctly normalized. Note that this procedure is not\nequivalent to simply generating a random catalogue by shuf-\nfling the data redshifts as we retain the modulation of the\nredshift distribution caused by the varying survey magni-\ntude limit that was built into the standard random cata-\nlogue.\nFig. 17n shows that the only effect of adopting this em-\npirical redshift distribution is, unsurprisingly a reduction of\nthe power on the very largest scales and that even here the\nshift is not large compared to the statistical errors. Adopting\nthis estimate rather than our standard one only shifts our\nestimates of the cosmological parameters \u2126mh and \u2126b\/\u2126m\nby +0.006 and \u22120.03 respectively. These shifts, which are\nsmaller than the 1\u03c3 statistical errors, should be considered\nextreme, as adopting an empirical redshift distribution will\nundoubtedly lead to the removal of some genuine large scale\nradial density fluctuations.\n6.7 Region\nIn Figs 17o,p,q and r, we show the effect of excluding var-\nious regions from our analysis. The effect of excluding the\nrandom fields is very modest. In particular, we note that the\noscillatory features in the estimated power spectra around\nk \u2248 0.15 h\u22121Mpc are present both with and without the\nrandom fields and that once the effects of the very differ-\nent window functions (see Fig. 9) have been compensated\nfor, Fig. 17p, the power spectra agree very accurately. This\nclearly demonstrates that these features are not related to\nthe presence or absence of a secondary peak in the window\nfunction. Also shown in Figs 17o and p is the effect of exclud-\ning from our data the two superclusters identified by Baugh\net al. (2004) and Croton et al. (2004) and mapped using\nthe Wiener filtering technique by Erdogdu et al. (2004).\nThe northern supercluster is the heart of the structure that\nhas also become known as the Sloan great wall (Gott et al.\n2005). Here we have simply excised these superclusters by\ncutting out regions of 9x9 degrees and \u2206z = 0.1 centred\non the superclusters. These superclusters are known to per-\nturb higher order clustering statistics significantly (Croton\net al. 2004), but we see that their removal causes a negligible\nreduction in the large-scale power. Using this dataset only\nshifts our estimates of the cosmological parameters \u2126mh and\n\u2126b\/\u2126m by +0.008 and \u22120.026 respectively. These shifts are\nmuch smaller than the 1\u2212 \u03c3 statistical errors. Also, as gen-\nuine structure is being removed one expects the large-scale\npower to be suppressed. Clearly these superclusters do not\nsignificantly perturb our estimated power spectrum.\nExcluding either the NGP or SGP strips has a large\neffect on the window function and this is partly responsi-\nble for the changes in the recovered power seen in Fig. 17q.\nBut in this case cosmic variance is also important and so,\neven when we compensate for the window, as is done in\nFig. 17r, we do not expect perfect agreement between these\n2dFGRS power spectrum 23\nestimates; for independent samples, we would expect differ-\nences comparable to the statistical errors. The errors from\nour log-normal mocks shown on the independent NGP and\nSGP estimates indicate that only on the very largest scales,\nwhere the data points are highly correlated, do the estimates\ndiffer by more than 1\u03c3. If the likelihood analysis described in\nSection 8 is applied separately to these two samples we find\n\u2126mh = 0.168 \u00b1 0.035, \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.163 \u00b1 0.075 for the SGP\nand \u2126mh = 0.205 \u00b1 0.037, \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.116 \u00b1 0.072 for the\nNGP, which are entirely consistent within their statistical\nerrors.\n6.8 Estimator\nIn Figs 17s and t, we compare the result of using the FKP\nrather than the PVP estimator. We have adjusted the nor-\nmalization of the FKP estimate by a factor \u3008b\u22122\u3009 to ac-\ncount for the normalization difference in the definition of\nthe two estimators. If galaxies have a luminosity dependent\nbias, then the FKP estimator is biased, with the result that\none recovers a power spectrum convolved with an effective\nwindow function that is slightly different to the one assumed\n(PVP). Provided the model of luminosity dependent bias\nis correct, then the PVP estimator removes this bias. The\ntwo recovered power spectra shown in Fig. 17t differ only\nslightly in shape indicating that the bias resulting from using\nthe FKP estimator, as was done in P01, is small. Further-\nmore, even if our model of bias dependence on luminosity\nand colour is not highly accurate, the effect on the recovered\npower spectrum will be significantly smaller than the differ-\nence between the FKP and PVP estimates and so entirely\nnegligible.\n6.9 Summary\nIn conclusion, we have not identified any systematic effects\nat a level that is significant compared to the statistical er-\nrors. We return to this point in Section 8, where we show ex-\nplicitly how various systematic uncertainties affect the likeli-\nhood surfaces that quantify our constraints on cosmological\nparameters.\n7 NON-LINEARITY AND\nSCALE-DEPENDENT BIAS\nThe previous Section has demonstrated that we can measure\nthe spherically-averaged redshift-space power spectrum of\nthe 2dFGRS in a robust fashion. We now have to consider\nin detail the critical issue of how the galaxy measurements\nrelate to the power spectrum of the underlying density field.\nThe conventional approach is to assume that, on large\nenough scales, linear theory provides an adequate descrip-\ntion of the shape of the galaxy power spectrum. In reality,\nthis agreement can never be perfect, and we need a model\nfor the differences between the galaxy power spectrum and\nlinear theory. In this Section, we pursue a number of ap-\nproaches for estimating such corrections; detailed simula-\ntions, analytical models, and an empirical hybrid approach\nare all considered.\nFigure 18. The power spectrum of the mass and galaxies in the\nHubble Volume simulation cube. The solid curve in the upper\npanel shows the input linear theory power spectrum. The dot-\nted and dashed curves show the power spectrum for the galaxies\nin real and redshift space respectively. In the lower panel, using\nthe same line types, we show these galaxy power spectra divided\nby the linear theory power spectrum, scaled by the square of ex-\npected bias factor. The solid curve shows the ratio of the mass to\nlinear theory power spectra.\n7.1 Simulated galaxy catalogues\nWe start by considering the power spectrum of the Hubble\nVolume galaxies. Fig. 18 shows results from the full Hubble\nVolume, both in real and redshift space. Here, we use all 109\nparticles in the simulation cube weighted by the probability\nof each particle being selected as a galaxy. On large scales\n(k <\n\u223c\n0.1 h\u22121Mpc) both the real-space and redshift-space\ngalaxy power spectra are related to linear theory by a simple\nscale independent constant. The large scale linear bias factor\nfor the galaxies in real space is b = 1.03. On these large scales\nthe redshift-space power is boosted by the Kaiser (1987)\nfactor b2(1 + 2\/3 \u03b2 + 1\/5 \u03b22); here \u03b2 = \u21260.6m \/b = 0.471, so\nthe expected boost factor is 1.441, in excellent agreement\nwith the simulation results.\nIn real space, both the mass and galaxy power spectra\nbegin to exceed the linear theory prediction significantly for\nk >\n\u223c\n0.12 hMpc\u22121. In redshift space, the smearing effect of\nthe random galaxy velocities reduces the small scale power\nwith the result that deviations from linear theory are greatly\nreduced. This cancellation of the distortions caused by non-\nlinearity, bias and mapping to redshift space was used in\n24 Cole et al.\nP01 to motivate fitting the 2dFGRS with linear theory for\nk < 0.15 hMpc\u22121. The Hubble Volume results presented\nhere reinforce this argument, although there is a suggestion\nthat the redshift-space power underestimates linear theory\nby up to 10% on small scales.\nThe Hubble Volume simulations are realistic in some re-\nspects, but they do not treat the relation between mass and\nlight in a particularly physical way. According to current un-\nderstanding, the location of galaxies within the dark matter\nis determined largely by the dark-matter halos and their\nmerger history. Full semi-analytic models of galaxy forma-\ntion follow halo merger trees within a numerical simulation,\nand can yield impressively realistic results. An important\nlandmark for this kind of work was the paper by Benson\net al. (2000), who showed how a semi-analytic model could\nnaturally yield a correlation function that is close to a sin-\ngle power law over 1000 >\n\u223c\n\u03be >\n\u223c\n1, even though the mass\ncorrelations show a marked curvature over this range. We\nhave used the most recent version of this code to predict\nthe galaxy power spectra, and their ratio to linear theory.\nThis is shown in Fig. 19, for a model close to our final pre-\nferred cosmology: \u2126m = 0.25, \u2126b = 0.045, h = 0.73 and\n\u03c38 = 0.9. The simulation volume has a side of 1000 h\n\u22121Mpc\nand 109 simulation particles. One advantage of this more de-\ntailed simulation is that the predicted colour distribution is\nbimodal, and so we are able to identify red and blue subsets\nin the same way as for the real data.\nThese results paint a similar picture to what was seen in\nthe Hubble Volume, despite the very different treatment of\nbias. On intermediate scales, there is a tendency for galaxy\npower to lie below linear theory. In real space, this trend\nreverses around k = 0.1 hMpc\u22121, and galaxy power exceeds\nlinear theory for k >\u223c 0.2 hMpc\u22121. A small-scale increase is\nalso seen in redshift space, but redshift-space smearing nat-\nurally means that the effect is reduced.\nIt will be convenient to consider a fitting formula for the\ndistortion seen in this simulation, and the following simple\nform works well:\nPgal =\n1 +Qk2\n1 + Ak\nPlin. (23)\nThe required parameters to fit the \u2018all galaxy\u2019 data, shown\nby the dashed lines in Fig. 19, are A = 1.7 and Q = 9.6 (real\nspace) or A = 1.4 and Q = 4.0 (redshift space). The criti-\ncal question is whether this correction is robust, both with\nrespect to variations in the galaxy-formation model and vari-\nations in cosmology. It is impractical to address this directly\nby running a large library of simulations, so we consider an\nalternative analytic approach.\n7.2 The halo model\nThe success of Benson et al.\u2019s work stimulated the analytic\n\u2018halo model\u2019, which allows one to understand rather sim-\nply the differences in shape between the galaxy and mass\npower spectra (Seljak 2000; Peacock & Smith 2000; Cooray\n& Sheth 2002). In this approach, the galaxy density field re-\nsults from a superposition of dark-matter halos, with small-\nscale clustering arising from neighbours in the same halo.\nUsing the halo model, it is possible to predict the rela-\ntion between the galaxy power spectrum and linear theory.\nThis can be done as a function of galaxy type, by an ap-\npropriate choice of prescription for the occupation numbers\nof halos as a function of their mass. In effect, we can give\nparticles in halos a weight that depends on halo mass, as\nwas first considered by Jing, Mo & Bo\u00a8rner (1998). A simple\nbut instructive model for this is\nw(M) =\n{\n0 (M < Mc)\n(M\/Mc)\n\u03b1\u22121 (M > Mc)\n(24)\nA model in which mass traces light would haveMc \u2192 0 and\n\u03b1 = 1. In practice, data on group M\/L values argues for \u03b1\nsubstantially less than unity (Peacock & Smith 2000, see also\nCollister & Lahav 2005). More elaborate occupation models\ncan be considered (e.g. Tinker et al. 2005; Zheng et al. 2005)\nand have previously been applied to model 2dFGRS galaxy\nclustering (Van den Bosch, Yang & Mo 2003; Magliocchetti\n& Porciani 2003), but this simple model will suffice for the\npresent purpose: we are trying to estimate a small correction\nin any case, and are largely interested in how it may vary\nwith cosmology.\nThe translation of the halo model into redshift space has\nbeen discussed by White (2001), Seljak (2001) and Cooray\n(2004). In the halo model, one thinks of the real-space power\nspectrum as being a combination of two parts:\nPr = P2\u2212halo + P1\u2212halo, (25)\nrepresenting the effect of correlated halo centres (the first\nterm), plus power owing to halo discreteness and internal\nstructure of a single halo (the second term). In redshift\nspace, we expect the first term to undergo Kaiser (1987)\ndistortions, so that it gains a factor (1 + \u03b2\u00b52)2, where \u00b5 is\nthe cosine of the angle between the wavevector and the line\nof sight. Having shifted the halo centres to redshift space,\nthe effect of virialized velocities is to damp the total power\nfor modes along the line of sight:\nPs =\n(\n(1 + \u03b2\u00b52)2P2\u2212halo + P1\u2212halo\n)\nD2(\u00b5k). (26)\nFor a Gaussian distribution of velocities within a halo, the\ndamping factor is\nD(x) = exp\n(\n\u2212x2\/2\u03c32v\n)\n; (27)\nhere, \u03c3v denotes the one-dimensional halo velocity disper-\nsion in units of length (i.e. divided by H0). This expression\napplies for the case where \u03b2 and \u03c3v are the same for all\nhalos. Since both vary with mass, the expression must be\nappropriately averaged over halo mass, as described in the\nabove references.\nThis completes in outline the method needed to calcu-\nlate the redshift-space power spectrum. However, we will not\nuse all this apparatus: the halo model was not designed to\nwork at the precision of interest here, and we will therefore\nuse it only in a differential way which should minimize sys-\ntematics in the modelling. The power ratio of interest can\nbe expressed as\nP sgal\nPlin\n=\nP rgal\nPnl\n\u00d7 Pnl\nPlin\n\u00d7 P\ns\ngal\nP rgal\n. (28)\nFor the ratio to linear theory in real space, the last factor on\nthe rhs is not required. The advantage of this separation is\nthat we have accurate empirical methods of calculating the\nsecond and third terms on the rhs. The halo model is thus\nonly required to give the real-space ratio between galaxy and\nnonlinear mass power spectra.\n2dFGRS power spectrum 25\nFigure 19. Predictions for how the redshift-space power spec-\ntrum of galaxies may be expected to deviate from linear theory.\nA model with \u2126m = 0.25, \u2126b = 0.045, h = 0.73 and \u03c38 = 0.9 is\nassumed. The predictions of semi-analytic modelling are shown\nas points: filled circles denote red galaxies; open circles denote\nblue galaxies; stars denote all galaxies (to MbJ < \u221219). The\ndashed line shows the fitting formula described in the text. The\nsolid lines show the predictions made using the halo model for\nred (upper), blue (lower) and all (intermediate) galaxies. The oc-\ncupation parameters are adjusted so as to fit the real-space cor-\nrelation functions from Madgwick et al. (2003). We attempt to\nmake the calculation more robust by modelling the conversion\nbetween real and redshift space using the Ballinger et al. (1996)\nprescription. We use observed values of \u03b2 = 0.49 and \u03b2 = 0.48 and\nlarge-separation effective pairwise dispersions of 280 km s\u22121 and\n410 kms\u22121 for late and early types respectively from Madgwick\net al. (2003) and Hawkins et al. (2003)\nThe ratio between non-linear and linear mass power is\ngiven by the HALOFIT fitting formula from Smith et al.\n(2003). This procedure uses the same philosophy as the halo\nmodel, but is tuned to give an accurate fit to N-body data.\nFor the ratio between real-space and redshift-space galaxy\ndata, we adopt the model used in past 2dFGRS papers: a\ncombination of the Kaiser linear boost and the damping\ncorresponding to exponential pairwise velocities:\nPs = Pr(1 + \u03b2\u00b5\n2)2(1 + k2\u00b52\u03c32p\/2)\n\u22121, (29)\nwhere \u03c3p is the pairwise velocity dispersion translated into\nlength units, and Pr is the full real-space galaxy power spec-\ntrum (e.g. Ballinger et al. 1996). This has been shown to\nFigure 20. A more extensive set of predictions for the deviation\nof the galaxy power spectrum from linear theory, using the halo\nmodel as in Fig. 19. We retain \u2126b = 0.045 and h = 0.73, but\nvary \u2126m between 0.17 and 0.35. The normalization is chosen to\nscale as \u03c38 = 0.9(0.25\/\u2126m)0.6, as expected for a normalization to\nredshift-space distortions or cluster abundance. The plotted ratio\nis a weakly declining function of \u2126m (i.e. the lowest \u2126m gives the\nstrongest kick-up at high k).\nwork well in comparison with N-body data. For the present\npurpose, the advantage is that this correction is an observ-\nable, and therefore does not need to be modelled in a way\nthat introduces a cosmology-dependent uncertainty.\nWe therefore used the azimuthal average of the\nBallinger et al. expression to convert to redshift space. This\nallows us to use observed values: \u03b2 = 0.49, \u03b2 = 0.48 and\n\u03b2 = 0.46 and large-separation effective pairwise disper-\nsions of 280 km s\u22121, 410 km s\u22121 and 340 kms\u22121 for red, blue\nand all galaxies respectively. These figures are derived from\nMadgwick et al. (2003), but reduced by a factor 1.5 to allow\nfor the fact that pairwise dispersions appear to fall at large\nseparations (Hawkins et al. 2003). The ratio of bias param-\neters we found in Section 5.3 implies an expected value of\n\u03b2blue\/\u03b2red \u2248 1.45. This is larger than the ratio of best fit\nvalues found by Madgwick et al. (2003), but within their\nquoted errors.\nThe resulting galaxy power spectra are also shown in\nFig. 19, and are relatively consistent with the direct simu-\nlation results. The observed power is expected to fall pro-\ngressively below linear theory as we move to higher k, with\n26 Cole et al.\na reduction of approximately 10% at k = 0.1 hMpc\u22121. Be-\nyond this, the trend reverses as non-linearities add power\n\u2013 although in redshift space the effect is more of a plateau\nuntil k \u2243 0.3 hMpc\u22121.\nThe remaining issue is whether the correction depends\non the cosmological model. If we were to ignore all correc-\ntions and fit linear theory directly, as in P01, there is a rela-\ntively well-defined apparent model. In the spirit of perturba-\ntion theory, there would then be a case for simply calculating\nthe correction for that model and applying it. However, it is\nmore reassuring to be able to investigate the model depen-\ndence of the correction. This is shown in Fig. 20. Here, we\ntake the approach of varying the most uncertain cosmologi-\ncal parameter, \u2126m. We hold \u2126b = 0.045 and h = 0.73 fixed,\nbut vary \u2126m between 0.17 and 0.35. The normalization is\nchosen to scale as \u03c38 = 0.9(0.25\/\u2126m)\n0.6, as expected for a\nnormalization to redshift-space distortions or cluster abun-\ndance. A less realistic choice (\u03c38 = 0.9 independent of \u2126m)\nshows similar trends: the fall in power to k = 0.1 hMpc\u22121\nis virtually identical, but there is a dispersion in where the\nsmall-scale upturn becomes important (a maximum range\nof a factor 2 in k).\nTo summarise, it seems clear that we should expect\nsmall systematic distortions of the galaxy power spectrum\nwith respect to linear theory. The robust prediction is that\nthe power ratio should fall monotonically between k = 0\nand k = 0.1 hMpc\u22121. Beyond that, the trend reverses, but\nthe calculation of the degree of reversal is not completely\nrobust. This motivates our final hybrid strategy. We adopt\nthe formula (equation 23) that was used to fit the data from\nthe simulation populated by the semi-analytic model\nPgal =\n1 +Qk2\n1 + Ak\nPlin, (30)\nbut we do not take the parameters as fixed. Rather, the\nlarge-scale parameter is assumed to be A = 1.4 (redshift\nspace) or A = 1.7 (cluster collapsed\/ real space) as in the\nsimulation fits, but the small-scale quadratic Q parameter is\nallowed to vary over a range up to approximately double the\nexpected value (Qmax = 12 in real space and 8 in redshift\nspace). This allows the residual uncertainty in the small-\nscale behaviour to be treated as a nuisance parameter to be\ndetermined empirically and marginalized over.\nAs we will see in the following Section, the net result of\nfollowing this strategy is a systematic shift in the recovered\ncosmological parameters of almost exactly 1\u03c3. In a sense,\nthen, this apparatus is unnecessarily complex (and was jus-\ntifiably neglected in P01). However, the fact that we can\nmake a reasonable estimate of the extent of systematics at\nthis level should increase confidence in the final results.\n8 LIKELIHOOD ANALYSIS AND MODEL\nFITTING\n8.1 Likelihood fitting\nHaving measured the 2dFGRS power spectrum in a series of\nbins, we now wish to model the likelihood \u2013 i.e. the proba-\nbility density function of the data given different cosmolog-\nical models. Assuming that the power spectrum errors have\nGaussian statistics that are independent of the model being\ntested, the likelihood function is\n\u22122 lnL = ln |C|+\u2211\nij\n[P (ki)\nTH \u2212 P (ki)]C\u22121ij [P (kj)TH \u2212 P (kj)], (31)\nup to an irrelevant additive constant. Here P (k)TH is the\ntheoretical power spectrum to be tested, P (k) is the ob-\nserved power spectrum and C is the covariance matrix of\nthe data.\nThis form for the likelihood is only an approximation.\nFor a Gaussian random field where the window and shot\nnoise are negligible, the exact likelihood is given by\n\u22122 lnL =\n\u2211\ni\n[\nlnP (ki)\nTH +\n\u03b4\u00af2(ki)\nP (ki)TH\n]\n, (32)\nwhere \u03b4\u00af(ki) gives the observed transformed overdensity field.\nThis equation is simply the standard Gaussian likelihood as\nin Eq. 31, but now with \u03b4\u00af(ki) as the Gaussian random vari-\nable. Equation 32 has been simplified because \u3008\u03b4\u00af(ki)\u3009 = 0\nindependent of model to be tested, and \u3008\u03b4\u00af(ki)\u03b4\u00af(ki)\u3009 =\nP (ki)\nTH. In Percival et al. (2004b), where we presented\na decomposition of the 2dFGRS into spherical harmonics,\nthe likelihood was calculated assuming Gaussianity in the\nFourier modes of the decomposed density field \u03b4(ki), as in\nthis equation. However, in practice this method is difficult:\nthe window function causes \u03b4\u00af(ki) and \u03b4\u00af(kj) to be correlated\nfor i 6= j, and shot noise means that \u3008\u03b4\u00af2(ki)\u3009 6= P (ki)TH. We\ntherefore prefer in the present work to use the faster approx-\nimate likelihood, knowing that the method can be validated\nempirically using mock data.\nFollowing the assumption that the likelihood can be\nwritten in the form of equation 31, we need to define a co-\nvariance matrix for each model under test. In Section 4.2.2\nwe used mock 2dFGRS catalogues for a single theoretical\npower spectrum in order to estimate the power covariance\nmatrix. In principle, this procedure should be repeated for\neach model under test. However, in the case of an ideal sur-\nvey with no window or noise, the appropriate covariance\nmatrix should be diagonal and dependent on the power spec-\ntrum to be tested through\nCii \u221d [P (ki)TH]2. (33)\nWe use this scaling to suggest the following dependence of\nthe covariance matrix on the theoretical model being con-\nsidered:\nCij =\nP (ki)\nTHP (kj)\nTH\nP (ki)LNP (kj)LN\nCLNij ; (34)\nhere CLNij is the original covariance matrix estimated using\nthe log-normal catalogues, and PLN is the true power spec-\ntrum of these catalogues. In other words, we assume that\nthe correlation coefficient between modes will be set by the\nsurvey window and will be independent of the theoretical\npower spectrum. The primary results on parameter estima-\ntion are calculated following this assumption. We show in\nSection 8.3 that, in any case, the results obtained by using\nequation 34 are very similar to those that follow from the\nassumption of a fixed covariance matrix.\n2dFGRS power spectrum 27\nFigure 21. Contour plots showing changes in the likelihood from the maximum of 2\u2206 lnL = 1.0, 2.3, 6.0, 9.2 for different parameter\ncombinations for the redshift-space 2dFGRS power spectrum, assuming a \u039bCDM cosmology with h = 0.72 and ns = 1.0. These contour\nintervals correspond to 1\u03c3 1-parameter, and 1,2,3\u03c3 2-parameter confidence intervals for independent Gaussian random variables. The\npower spectrum was fitted for 0.02 < k < 0.20 hMpc\u22121, marginalizing over 0 < Q < 8. The solid circle marks the maximum likelihood\nposition for each 2dFGRS likelihood surface.\n8.2 Models, parameters and priors\nWhen fitting the 2dFGRS data, the parameter space has\nthe five dimensions needed to describe the matter power\nspectrum in the simplest CDM models:\np = (\u2126m,\u2126b, h, ns, \u03c38), (35)\nwhere ns is the scalar spectral index and the other parame-\nters are as discussed earlier. For analyses including the CMB,\none would add four further parameters: spatial curvature, an\namplitude and slope for the tensor spectrum, plus \u03c4 , the op-\ntical depth to last scattering. These do not affect the matter\nspectrum, which we calculate using the formulae of Eisen-\nstein & Hu (1998).\nIn practice, this dimensionality can be reduced. For a\ngiven ns, the shape of the matter power spectrum depends\nmainly on two parameter combinations: (1) the matter den-\nsity times the Hubble parameter \u2126mh; (2) the baryon frac-\ntion \u2126b\/\u2126m. There is a weak residual dependence on h, but\nwe neglect this because h is very well constrained by any\nanalysis that includes CMB data. We therefore adopt the\nfixed value h = 0.72. A similar argument is not so readily\nmade for ns; even though this too is accurately determined\nin joint analyses with CMB data, there is strong direct de-\ngeneracy between the value of ns and our main parameters.\nFortunately, this is easy enough to treat directly: raising ns\nincreases small-scale power and thus requires a lower den-\nsity compared to the figure deduced when fixing ns = 1, for\nwhich an adequate approximation is\n(\u2126mh)true = (\u2126mh)apparent + 0.3(1\u2212 ns). (36)\nSimilarly, we choose to neglect possible effects of a neu-\ntrino rest mass. It is known from oscillation experiments\nthat this is justified provided that the mass eigenstates are\nnon-degenerate. Again, it is straightforward to allow directly\nfor a violation of this assumption:\n(\u2126mh)true = (\u2126mh)apparent + 1.2(\u2126\u03bd\/\u2126m) (37)\n(Elgaroy et al. 2002). Finally, as discussed above in Sec-\ntion 7, we assume a simple quadratic model (equation 23)\nwith a single free parameter, Q, for the small-scale devi-\nations from linear theory caused by non-linear effects and\nredshift-space distortions. The parameter A in equation 23\ndescribing large-scale quasilinear effects is held constant at\nA = 1.4.\nThe calculation of the likelihood of a cosmological\nmodel given just the 2dFGRS data is computationally in-\nexpensive, and we can therefore use grids to explore the pa-\nrameter space of interest. When each likelihood calculation\nbecomes more computationally expensive, or the parame-\nter space becomes larger, then a different technique such\nas Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) would be expedi-\nent. In Section 9.2 we use the MCMC technique when com-\nbining large-scale structure and CMB data. For our explo-\nration of the cosmological implications of the 2dFGRS data\nalone, grids of likelihoods were calculated using the method\ndescribed in Section 8.1, uniformly distributed in parame-\nter space over 0.05 < \u2126mh < 0.3, 0 < \u2126b\/\u2126m < 0.5 and\n0.6 < \u03c3gal8 < 1.1 and 0 < Q < 8 for standard redshift-space\ncatalogues, and 4 < Q < 12 for cluster-collapsed catalogues,\nwhich we treat as if they were in real space. These grids\nwere used to marginalize over parameters assuming uniform\npriors with these limits.\nCompared to the shape parameters \u2126mh and \u2126b\/\u2126m,\nthe normalization of the model power spectrum is a rela-\ntively uninteresting parameter, over which we will normally\nmarginalize. However, it has some interesting degeneracies\nwith the shape parameters, which are worth displaying. It\nshould be emphasised that the meaning of the normalization\nis not straightforward, owing to the depth of the survey. We\nthus measure an amplitude at some mean redshift greater\nthan zero (the fitted parameters \u2126m and \u2126b, however, do\ncorrespond strictly to z = 0). We normalize the power spec-\ntrum using the rms density contrast averaged over spheres\nof 8h\u22121Mpc radius. If we define \u03c38 to correspond to the\nlinear mass overdensity field at redshift zero, then the nor-\nmalization of the measured power spectrum corresponds to\nan \u2018apparent\u2019 value \u03c3gal8 , which should not be confused with\nan estimate for the true value of \u03c38:\n28 Cole et al.\n\u03c3gal8 = b(L\u2217, zs)D(zs)K\n1\/2(\u03b2[L\u2217, zs]) \u03c38, (38)\nwhere zs is the mean redshift of the weighted overdensity\nfield, D(zs) is the linear growth factor between redshift 0\nand zs, K(\u03b2[L\u2217, zs]) = 1 + 2\/3 \u03b2 + 1\/5 \u03b2\n2 is the spheri-\ncally averaged Kaiser linear boost factor that corrects for\nlinear redshift distortions of L\u2217 galaxies at redshift zs, and\nb(L\u2217, zs) is the bias of L\u2217 galaxies between the real space\ngalaxy overdensity field and the linear mass overdensity field\nat redshift zs (see Lahav et al. 2002).\n8.3 2dFGRS results\nFig. 21 shows our default set of likelihood contours for\n\u2126mh, \u2126b\/\u2126m and the normalization \u03c3\ngal\n8 , calculated us-\ning the redshift-space power spectrum data with 0.02 <\nk < 0.20 hMpc\u22121, marginalizing over the distortion pa-\nrameter Q. There is a weak degeneracy between \u2126mh and\n\u2126b\/\u2126m as found in P01, corresponding to power spectra\nwith approximately the same shape. However this degen-\neracy is broken more strongly than in P01 and we find\nmaximum-likelihood values of \u2126mh = 0.168 \u00b1 0.016 and\n\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.185 \u00b1 0.046. Here, the errors quoted are the\nrms of the marginalized probability distribution for the pa-\nrameter under study. For a Gaussian random variable, this\ncorresponds to the 68% confidence interval for 1 parameter.\nThe normalization is measured to be \u03c3gal8 = 0.924 \u00b1 0.032,\nand we find a marginalized value of Q = 4.6 \u00b1 1.5, when\nfitting to 0.02 < k < 0.30 hMpc\u22121, well within the range of\nQ considered. The improvement in the accuracy of the pa-\nrameter constraints compared to those of P01 is the result\nof three factors. For example the error on \u2126mh is reduced\nby 0.006, 0.005 and 0.003 by the increased angular coverage,\nincreasing zmax to 0.3 and adopting the more optimal PVP\nweighting respectively.\n8.3.1 Dependence on scale\nIn order to test the robustness of recovered parameters to\nthe scales probed, Fig. 22 shows marginalized values of \u2126mh\nand \u2126b\/\u2126m as a function of kmax (i.e. fitting to data with\n0.02 < k < kmax), contrasting results assuming that the ob-\nserved galaxy power spectrum is directly proportional to\nthe linear matter power spectrum with results involving\nmarginalization over Q and a large-scale correction as de-\nscribed in Section 7. We also compare results from the origi-\nnal redshift-space data to those calculated after the clusters\nhave been collapsed. For the redshift-space data, we find that\nincluding the Q prescription makes very little difference to\nthe recovered parameters for kmax <\u223c 0.15 hMpc\n\u22121, confirm-\ning the premise of P01 (i.e. the solid and dotted lines in the\nleft column are similar for kmax <\u223c 0.15 hMpc\n\u22121). However,\nthis is not true for smaller scales.\nIf we restrict ourselves to the assumption that the mea-\nsured power spectrum reflects linear theory exactly (dotted\nlines) then there is a trend towards higher \u2126mh and lower\nbaryon fraction with increasing kmax. This effect is espe-\ncially marked for the data where the clusters have been col-\nlapsed. However, if we apply our hybrid correction with Q\nbeing allowed to float, these variations disappear: the recov-\nered parameters display no significant change when kmax is\nincreased from 0.15 hMpc\u22121 to 0.3 hMpc\u22121. This suggests\nFigure 22. Marginalized parameters as a function of the maxi-\nmum fitted k for the 2dFGRS redshift-space catalogue (left col-\numn), and after collapsing the clusters (right column). The rows\nare for different parameters and the recovered errors calculated by\nmarginalizing over the region of parameter space considered (see\ntext for details). Solid lines (both for marginalized parameter and\nerror) include a possible correction for non-linear and small-scale\nredshift space distortion effects parameterized by Q, dotted lines\nmake no corrections to linear theory. The shaded region shows\nthe \u00b11\u03c3 confidence region, indicating that systematic corrections\nare at most comparable to the random errors.\nthat the Q prescription is able to capture the real distortions\nof the redshift-space power spectrum with respect to linear\ntheory.\nOn the other hand, it should be noted that the er-\nrors initially fall with increasing kmax, but beyond kmax \u2243\n0.2 hMpc\u22121 there is no further reduction in the error \u2013 there\n2dFGRS power spectrum 29\nFigure 23. Contour plots showing changes in the likelihood from the maximum of 2\u2206 lnL = 1.0, 2.3, 6.0, 9.2 for different parameter\ncombinations for the redshift-space 2dFGRS power spectrum, assuming a \u039bCDM cosmology with h = 0.72 and ns = 1.0. Dashed contours\nin all plots are as in Fig. 21 and were fitted for 0.02 < k < 0.20hMpc\u22121, marginalizing over Q.

See text for further details of each likelihood calculation.\n30 Cole et al.\nFigure 23 \u2013 continued\nis little additional information in the small scale data about\nthe shape of the linear power spectrum.\n8.3.2 Dependence on other assumptions\nIn Fig. 23 we compare the default likelihood surface from\nFig. 21 (dashed lines), with surfaces calculated using either\ndifferent data, or with a revised method.\n(a) The three plots in the top-left of this figure show the\nlikelihood surface calculated using a fixed covariance matrix\n(solid lines). This change in the method by which the like-\nlihood is estimated is discussed further in Section 8.1. The\nnet effect here is very small.\n(b) In the three contour plots in the top-right of this\nfigure, we show likelihood surfaces fitting to 0.02 < k <\n0.15 hMpc\u22121 fixing Q = 0, (i.e. not allowing for any correc-\ntion for small-scale effects), but still including the large-scale\ncorrection. The constraints on the power spectrum normal-\nization and \u2126mh are consistent in the two cases. \u2126mh in-\ncreases by about 2%, and the baryon fraction increases by\nabout 10%.\n(c) The effect of calculating the log-normal catalogues\nwith model parameters other than the best-fit parameters\nis shown in Fig. 23c. Here the solid contours relate to the\nparameters of the Hubble Volume simulation (h = 0.7, \u2126m =\n0.3, \u2126\u039b = 0.7, \u2126b = 0.04 and \u03c38 = 0.9). However, this\nchange in the assumed covariance matrix does not induce a\nsignificant change in the recovered parameter values.\n(d) Instead of directly using the log-normal catalogues\nto estimate the covariance matrix, we have also considered\nusing the jack-knife resampling of the 2dFGRS data de-\nscribed in Section 6. The jack-knife estimate of the covari-\nance matrix was unstable to direct inversion; as an alter-\nnative, we smoothed the fractional difference between the\njack-knife and log-normal covariance matrices, and used this\nsmoothed map to adjust the log-normal covariance matrix.\nThis resulted in essentially negligible change in the likeli-\nhood contours.\n(e) The bottom left part of Fig. 23 shows likelihood\nsurfaces calculated after collapsing the clusters in the 2dF-\nGRS dataset. The scales fitted are the same in both cases,\nand both surfaces were calculated after marginalizing over\nQ. The shapes of the surfaces are in excellent agreement.\n(f) In Fig. 23f we compare the new likelihood surface\nwith that calculated using pre-Feb 2001 data. Rather than\nusing the P01 data and covariance matrix, we reanalyse the\npre-Feb 2001 data with our new method. We see that most of\nthe difference between the result of P01 (\u2126mh = 0.20\u00b10.03,\n\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.15 \u00b1 0.07) and our current best-fit parameters\ncomes from the larger volume now probed: the parameter\nconstraints in this plot were calculated in the same way for\nboth datasets. For an alternative comparison, Fig. 24 com-\npares our current likelihood surface with that of P01 over\nan extended parameter range. This shows that, in addition\nto the tightening of the confidence interval on parameters,\nthe high baryon fraction solution of P01 is now rejected at\nhigh confidence.\n(g) & (h) In these panels we show likelihood surfaces\nfor the two samples defined by splitting the catalogue at\na rest frame colour of (bJ \u2212 rF)z=0 = 1.07. In contrast to\nthe samples discussed in Section 5.3 and plotted in Fig. 15,\nwe do not force the mean weight per unit redshift to be\nthe same for both samples. The samples therefore sample\ndifferent regions, and some of the difference will be caused\nby cosmic variance. In both cases, a consistent \u2126mh \u2243 0.17\nis derived.\n8.4 Fitting to the HV mocks\nAs a final test, we apply the full fitting machinery to a set\nof 22 mock catalogues drawn from the Hubble Volume sim-\nulation (see Section 4.2.1). As discussed above, the choice\nof a fixed covariance matrix has only a minor effect on the\nresults, so we use a single covariance matrix to analyse all\nthese mock surveys. This approach also has the advantage\nthat it is easier to test directly whether the distribution of\nthe recovered parameters from these catalogues is consistent\nwith the predicted confidence intervals.\nIn Fig. 25 we plot the recovered marginalized parame-\nters from different sets of 22 redshift-space, real-space and\ncluster collapsed Hubble Volume mock catalogues. In gen-\neral, the distribution of \u2126mh and \u2126b\/\u2126m values follows the\n2dFGRS power spectrum 31\nFigure 25. Recovered marginalized parameters from 22 Hubble Volume mock catalogues, demonstrating our ability to recover the true\ninput parameters from samples that accurately match the size and geometry of the 2dFGRS survey. The solid lines mark the true\ncosmological parameters and normalization of the Hubble Volume simulation, calculated from a large realization of galaxies covering\nthe full Hubble Volume cube. Open circles mark the marginalized parameters recovered from mocks with 2(lnLmax \u2212 lnLtrue) < 2.3\n(corresponding to mocks with recovered parameters less than 1\u03c3 from the true values), open squares 2.3 < 2(lnLmax \u2212 lnLtrue) < 6.0\n(1\u03c3 to 2\u03c3 from the true values), and open triangles 2(lnLmax \u2212 lnLtrue > 6.0 (>2\u03c3 from the true values). The solid circle marks the\naverage recovered parameters from all of the mocks. a) for the redshift-space Hubble Volume mocks fitting to 0.02 < k < 0.20hMpc\u22121\nmarginalizing over Q. b) for the real-space Hubble Volume mocks. c) for the cluster-collapsed redshift-space mocks. d) for the redshift-\nspace Hubble Volume mocks fitting to 0.02 < k < 0.15 hMpc\u22121 with Q = 0.\ngeneral degeneracy of cosmological models which give pa-\nrameter surfaces with the same approximate shape as shown\nin Fig. 21. There is no evidence for a strong bias in the re-\ncovered parameters, and we find that the average recovered\nparameters are close to the true values.\nBecause the Hubble Volume mocks do not have lumi-\nnosity dependent bias and we analyse them with the FKP\nestimator, the normalisation we recover corresponds to the\ntypical galaxies, which have a bias that is approximately\n1.26 higher that of L\u2217 galaxies. Also, the prescription for\nscale-dependent bias given by equation (23) does not accu-\nrately match the artificial bias put into the Hubble Volume\nmocks, and the recovered \u03c38 values are seen to be slightly\noffset from the expected numbers. This effect is not signif-\nicant and merely relates to the crude bias model (equation\n20) used for the Hubble Volume mocks.\n32 Cole et al.\nFigure 24. Likelihood contours as in Fig. 21, but now calcu-\nlated using the data, covariance matrix and methodology of P01\n(dashed lines). The cosmological model is as described in Sec-\ntion 8.2 (it differs from that of P01 because we fix h = 0.72).\nHowever, we have chosen to plot the contours for an extended\nrange of \u2126mh to match the analysis of P01. For comparison, the\nsolid contours show our new default parameter constraints.\nThere is some evidence that the average recovered value\nof \u2126mh is higher for the real-space catalogues than for the\nredshift-space catalogues. This reflects the slight difference\nin large-scale shape between real and redshift space power\nspectra observed in Fig. 11. Even so, this deviation is smaller\nthan the 1\u03c3 errors on the recovered parameters from an\nindividual catalogue.\n9 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n9.1 Results from the complete 2dFGRS\nThis paper has been devoted to a detailed discussion of the\ngalaxy power spectrum as measured by the final 2dFGRS.\nWe have deduced improved versions of the masks that de-\nscribe the angular selection of the survey, and modelled the\nradial selection via a new empirical treatment of evolution-\nary corrections. We have carried out extensive checks of our\nmethodology, varying assumptions in the treatment of the\ndata and applying our full analysis method to realistic mock\ncatalogues.\nBased on these investigations, we are confident that the\n2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter\ncontent of the universe, via fitting to a CDM model. As-\nsuming a primordial ns = 1 spectrum and h = 0.72, the\nbest fitting model has \u03c72\/d.f. = 36\/32 and the preferred\nparameters are\n\u2126mh = 0.168 \u00b1 0.016 (39)\nand a baryon fraction\n\u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.185 \u00b1 0.046. (40)\nWe have kept ns and h fixed so that the quoted errors reflect\nonly the uncertainties that arises from the uncertainty in the\nshape of power spectrum and not additional uncertainties\ndue the choice of ns and h. However the values and errors\nare insensitive to the choice of h. Allowing 10% Gaussian\nuncertainty gives \u2126mh = 0.174\u00b10.019 and \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.190\u00b1\n0.053.\nThese values represent in some respects an important\nchange with respect to P01, who found \u2126mh = 0.20 \u00b1 0.03\nand \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.15\u00b1 0.07. Statistically, the shift in the pre-\nferred parameters is unremarkable. However, the precision\nis greatly improved, by nearly a factor 2. This reflects a sub-\nstantial increase in the survey volume since P01, both be-\ncause the survey sky coverage is 50% larger, and because our\nimproved understanding of the selection function enables us\nto work to larger redshifts. In particular, the reduced error\non the baryon fraction means that P01\u2019s suggestion of a non-\nzero baryon content can now be regarded as a definite mea-\nsurement. Our figure of \u2126b\/\u2126m = 0.185 \u00b1 0.046 appears at\nface value to be a 4-\u03c3 detection of baryon features, although\nthis overstates the significance. The difference in \u03c72 between\nthe best zero-baryon model and the best overall model is 6.3,\nso the likelihood ratio is L = exp(\u22126.3\/2). This might sug-\ngest a probability for no baryons of L\/(1 + L) = 0.04, but\nsuch a figure is too generous: for a Gaussian distribution, this\nvalue of L would be a 2.5-\u03c3 effect, with one-tailed probabil-\nity of 0.006. It therefore seems fair to reject the zero-baryon\nhypothesis at about the 1% level.\nIt should be emphasised that the above statements de-\npend on the theoretical framework of the \u039bCDM model.\nThis is important not only because the theory quantifies\nthe relation between the baryon fraction and any features in\nthe power spectrum, but because it constrains the allowed\nform of any baryon signature. What is impressive in our\ndata is not simply that the results suggest departures from\na smooth curve, but that these deviations occur in the loca-\ntions expected from theory. It is this prior knowledge that\ngives the extra statistical power needed in order to reject a\nzero-baryon model with confidence.\nOf course, proving that the universe contains baryons\nhardly ranks as a great novelty. It is an inevitable predic-\ntion of the \u039bCDM model that the matter power spectrum\nshould contain baryon features, and it has recently been con-\nfirmed directly that these should survive in the galaxy spec-\ntrum (Springel et al. 2005). The signature is much smaller\nthan the corresponding acoustic oscillations in the CMB, so\nthis measurement in no way competes with the CMB as a\nmeans of pinning down the baryon density. Nevertheless, by\ndemonstrating a clearcut connection between the tempera-\nture fluctuations in the CMB and the present-day galaxy\ndistribution, the identification of the baryon signal in the\n2dFGRS provides an important verification of our funda-\nmental model of structure formation.\n9.2 Cosmological implications\nThe ability of the matter power spectrum to determine cos-\nmological parameters in isolation is limited owing to the in-\nherent physical degeneracies in the CDM model. As is well\nknown, these can be overcome by combination with data on\nCMB anisotropies. The most striking success of this method\nto date has been the combination of the 2dFGRS results\nfrom P01 with the year-1 WMAP data (Spergel et al. 2003),\nthe results of which were subsequently confirmed using the\nSDSS galaxy power spectrum by Tegmark et al. (2004). It\n2dFGRS power spectrum 33\nis of interest to see how our earlier conclusions alter in the\nlight of our new results. We have used the Markov-Chain\nMonte-Carlo (MCMC; Lewis & Bridle 2002) method to fit\ncosmological models to our new power-spectrum data com-\nbined with WMAP year 1 (Hinshaw et al. 2003) CMB data.\nFor the choice of model, we adopted the philosophy of Per-\ncival et al. (2002), allowing \u2126m, \u2126b, h, ns, \u03c4 , \u03c38 and \u03c3\ngal\n8\nto vary while assuming negligible neutrino contribution and\na flat cosmology. The results, ignoring the normalization of\nthe model power spectra, are as follows:\n\u2126m = 0.231 \u00b1 0.021\n\u2126b = 0.042 \u00b1 0.002\nh = 0.766 \u00b1 0.032\nns = 1.027 \u00b1 0.050.\n(41)\nWe see that using the new 2dFGRS result decreases \u2126m\nby approximately 15% from the best-fit WMAP value of\n\u2126m \u2243 0.27. This change is easily understood because our\nnew best-fit \u2126mh = 0.168 is lower than that of P01. The\nCMB acoustic peak locations constrain \u2126mh\n3, so to fit the\nnew data requires a lower value of \u2126m coupled with a higher\nvalue of h. Again, what is impressive is that the accuracy is\nsignificantly improved, breaking the 10% barrier on \u2126m. For\ncomparison, The WMAP analysis in Spergel et al. (2003)\nachieved 15% accuracy on \u2126m. As a result, we are able\nto achieve a firm rejection of the common \u2018concordance\u2019\n\u2126m = 0.3 in favour of a lower value (0.19 < \u2126m < 0.27 at\n95% confidence). This result demonstrates that large-scale\nstructure measurements continue to play a crucial role in\ndetermining the cosmological model.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe data used here were obtained with the 2 degree field\nfacility on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT).
