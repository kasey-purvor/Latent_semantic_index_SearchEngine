Introduction\nRelativistic electrons (E > 1 MeV) in the Earth\u2019s outer radiation belt (3 < L < 7)26\ndamage satellites [Wrenn, 1995; Baker, 2001;Wrenn et al., 2002] and may penetrate to low27\naltitudes where they effect the chemistry of the middle atmosphere [e.g., Lastovicka, 1996].28\nThe flux of these so-called killer electrons changes dramatically on a variety of different29\ntimescales and covers a range of over five orders of magnitude [Baker and Kanekal, 2007].30\nThis variability is due to acceleration, transport, and loss processes, all of which become31\nenhanced during enhanced geomagnetic activity [e.g., Thorne et al., 2005; Horne et al.,32\n2006].33\nLocal acceleration is required to explain the developing peaks in phase space density34\nobserved during relativistic electron flux enhancements in the outer radiation belt [Green35\nand Kivelson, 2004; Iles et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007]. Gyroresonant wave-particle inter-36\nactions with whistler-mode chorus waves can energize a seed population of electrons with37\nenergies of a few hundred keV up to several MeV on a timescale of the order of a day [Horne38\nand Thorne, 1998; Summers et al., 1998, 2002, 2007; Meredith et al., 2002a, 2002b, 2003;39\nHorne et al., 2003, 2005a, 2005b; Shprits et al., 2006] and are consequently considered to40\nbe a very important local acceleration mechanism in the inner magnetosphere.41\nIt has recently been suggested that fast magnetosonic waves can lead to local electron42\nacceleration and, in particular, may energize electrons from \u223c 10 keV up to a few MeV43\nin the outer radiation belt [Horne et al., 2007]. Acceleration by magnetosonic waves,44\nwhich occurs via electron Landau resonance, may occur on a timescale of 1-2 days which45\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 4 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nis similar to that due to whistler mode chorus waves. Thus fast magnetosonic waves could46\nplay an important role in radiation belt dynamics and hence space weather.47\nFast magnetosonic waves, also referred to as equatorial noise to show the link with48\ntheir traditional name [Russel et al., 1970], are a natural, often intense, electromagnetic49\nwave emission observed in the inner magnetosphere near the geomagnetic equator. They50\nwere first observed by OGO3 at frequencies between twice the local proton gyrofrequency51\n(fcH) and half the lower hybrid resonance frequency (fLHR) and were confined to within52\n2o of the magnetic equator [Russell et al., 1970]. At low frequencies, near the proton53\ngyrofrequency, the spectrum of the waves consists of many spectral lines with different54\nfrequency spacings from a few Hz to a few tens of Hz [Gurnett, 1976]. The frequency55\nspacing was suggested to occur as result of interactions with ion cyclotron harmonics in a56\nregion where the local value for fcH matches the observed spacing. At higher frequencies,57\nboth structured [Gurnett, 1976; Santolik et al., 2002] and unstructured [Olsen et al., 1987;58\nBoardsen et al., 1992] emissions have been observed at frequencies just below fLHR. Lower59\nfrequencies, of the order of several ion gyrofrequencies, tend to be observed more frequently60\nthan higher frequencies [e.g., Nemec et al., 2005]. The waves have been observed at radial61\ndistances between 2\u22128Re at all latitudes within 10o of the magnetic equator [e.g., Perraut62\net al., 1982; Laakso et al., 1990; Kasahara et al., 1994], primarily in the afternoon and63\npre-midnight sectors [Perraut et al., 1982; Olsen et al., 1987]. They propagate across the64\nambient magnetic field Bo in the whistler mode with the k vector almost perpendicular65\nto Bo. They are compressional waves, in that the wave magnetic field lies almost along66\nthe ambient magnetic field Bo while the wave electric field is elliptically polarized and67\nlies in a plane almost perpendicular to Bo. In contrast, the wave electric and magnetic68\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 5\nfields for parallel-propagating whistler mode waves are circularly-polarised in the plane69\nperpendicular to Bo70\nMore recent data analysis shows that the wave power can be highly variable [Andre\u00b4 et al.,71\n2002] and that the occurrence rate is 60% near the equator for 3.9 < L < 5 [Santolik et al.,72\n2004]. Peak wave intensities occur within 2o of the magnetic equator and when the power73\nspectral density is modeled as a Gaussian in frequency the full width half maximum occurs74\nwithin 3o of the equator in most cases. Indeed, the central latitudes of fast magnetosonic75\nwaves seem to be located exactly at the true geomagnetic equator [Nemec et al., 2006].76\nRay tracing shows that propagation outside the plasmapause is limited to latitudes close77\nto the magnetic equator by electron Landau damping on plasmasheet electrons [Horne et78\nal., 2000], although in principle the waves should be able to propagate to higher latitudes79\ninside the plasmapause in regions where the plasma sheet electron flux is very low. The80\nwaves propagate both radially and azimuthally around the minimum Bo surface [Kasahara81\net al., 1994].82\nSimultaneous wave and particle observations, combined with instability calculations,83\nshow that the waves can be driven by a proton ring distribution at energies of \u223c 10 keV84\n[Boardsen et al., 1992; Horne et al., 2000]. Proton ring distributions have been observed in85\nassociation with magnetosonic waves for L \u2248 4 [Boardsen et al., 1992] and at geostationary86\norbit [Perraut et al., 1982]. Simulations show that proton ring distributions form during87\nstorm times as particles convect and diffuse radially inward and drift around the Earth.88\nThe ring forms at the inner edge of the ring current where losses due to charge exchange89\nwith neutral hydrogen increase rapidly with decreasing energy [Fok et al., 1995, 1996;90\nJordanova et al., 1996, 1999]. The ring distribution is also able to reproduce the observed91\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 6 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nbanded structure at low proton harmonics and, as a general rule of thumb, instability is92\npossible when the ring velocity perpendicular to Bo exceeds the local Alfve\u00b4n speed [Horne93\net al., 2000].94\nWhile statistical surveys of magnetosonic waves have concentrated on their wave prop-95\nerties and frequency of occurrence [Nemec et al., 2006; Santolik et al., 2004], in order96\nto quantify their role in radiation belt acceleration and loss processes more analysis is97\nrequired to determine how the intensity of the waves changes with magnetic activity, and98\nhow they are related to the ring current as a source of free energy. Here we conduct a99\nstatistical survey of the intensities of the fast magnetosonic waves using CRRES data to100\ndetermine the global distribution of the waves as a function of geomagnetic activity, and101\nto help determine where the waves should be most effective in accelerating electrons to102\nrelativistic energies. We also investigate one source of free energy that could drive the103\nwaves by conducting a statistical survey of the flux of 16.5 keV protons, and the occur-104\nrence of proton ring distributions, as a function of geomagnetic activity using concomitant105\nCRRES proton data.106\n2. Instrumentation\nThe Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite, CRRES [Johnson and Kierein,107\n1992], is particularly well-suited to studies of wave-particle interactions in the radiation108\nbelts both because of its orbit and sophisticated suite of wave and particle instruments.109\nThis satellite, which was launched on 25 July 1990, operated in a highly elliptical geosyn-110\nchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 305 km, an apogee of 35,768 km and an inclination111\nof 18o. The orbital period was approximately 10 hours, and the initial apogee was at a112\nmagnetic local time (MLT) of 0800 MLT. The magnetic local time of apogee decreased113\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 7\nat a rate of approximately 1.3 hours per month until the satellite failed on 11 October114\n1991, when its apogee was at about 1400 MLT. The satellite covered a range of L from115\nL = 1.05 to L =\u223c 8 and a range of magnetic latitudes within \u00b130o of the magnetic116\nequator, sweeping through the radiation belts approximately 5 times per day, providing117\ngood coverage of this important region for almost 15 months.118\nThe wave data used in this study were provided by the Plasma Wave Experiment119\non board the CRRES spacecraft. This experiment provided measurements of the wave120\nelectric fields using a 100 m tip-to-tip long wire antenna, with a dynamic range covering a121\nfactor of at least 105 in amplitude [Anderson et al., 1992]. The sweep frequency receiver,122\nused in this study, covered the frequency range from 100 Hz to 400 kHz in four bands123\nwith 32 logarithmically spaced steps per band, the fractional step separation, \u2206f\/f being124\nabout 6.7% across the entire frequency range. Band 1 (100 to 810 Hz) was sampled at125\none step per second with a complete cycle time of 32.768 s. Band 2 (810 Hz to 6.4 kHz)126\nwas sampled at two steps per second with a complete cycle time of 16.384 s. Band 3 (6.4127\nto 51.7 kHz) and band 4 (51.7 to 400 kHz) were each sampled 4 times per second, with128\ncomplete cycling times of 8.192 s. The nominal bandwidths in bands 1, 2, 3, and 4 were129\n7 Hz, 56 Hz, 448 Hz, and 3.6 kHz, respectively. The electric field detector was thus able130\nto detect waves from below the lower hybrid resonance frequency(fLHR) to well above the131\nupper hybrid resonance frequency (fUHR) for a large fraction of each orbit.132\nThe low-energy proton data used in this study were collected by the Low Energy133\nPlasma Analyser (LEPA). This instrument consisted of two electrostatic analyzers with134\nmicrochannel plate detectors, each with a field of view of 120o \u00d7 5o, one measuring elec-135\ntrons and the other positive ions in the energy range 10 eV < E < 30 keV [Hardy et al.,136\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 8 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\n1993]. The instrument detected the complete pitch angle range from 0o to 180o every 30137\ns with a resolution of 5.625o \u00d7 8o at 30 energy channels in the range 10 eV < E < 30138\nkeV. For the purposes of this paper we assume an electron-hydrogen plasma and that the139\nobserved ions are protons.140\n3. CRRES Database\nIn order to perform a statistical analysis of the occurrence of magnetosonic waves, and141\none source of free energy that can drive the waves unstable, we constructed a database142\nof the wave spectral intensity and proton flux using CRRES data. The wave data were143\ninitially corrected for the instrumental background response and smoothed by using a144\nrunning 3 minute average to take out the beating effects due to differences in the sam-145\npling and the spin rate. Spurious data points, data spikes, and periods of instrumental146\ndowntime were flagged and ignored in the subsequent statistical analyses. Twelve orbits,147\nduring which non-traditional configurations were deployed for testing purposes, were also148\nexcluded from the analyses.149\nMagnetosonic waves generally lie between fcH and fLHR. However, since the lowest150\nfrequency covered by the sweep frequency receiver is 100 Hz, setting fcH as the lowest151\nfrequency for a survey of the wave power would restrict the range of L to very low values152\n(\u2264 1.7) as f \u2248 fcH \u2248 100 Hz at L = 1.7. Therefore, wave electric field intensities were153\ndetermined for the band 0.5fLHR < f < fLHR to provide a balance between including154\nthe strongest emissions whilst providing a reasonable coverage in L. The intensities in155\nthis band, together with the amplitudes from fce < f < 2fce, the spectral intensities at156\neach frequency of the sweep frequency receiver, and the proton differential number flux157\nat 90o pitch angle for each energy level of the LEPA instrument, were then rebinned as158\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 9\na function of half orbit (outbound and inbound) and L in steps of 0.1L. The data were159\nrecorded together with the universal time (UT), magnetic latitude (\u03bbm), magnetic local160\ntime (MLT), substorm and geomagnetic activity indices AE and Kp, and time spent in161\neach bin with the same resolution.162\nSince the characteristics of magnetosonic waves may vary according to high and low163\nplasma density the emissions were split into two categories, defined as either inside or164\noutside the plasmapause. Waves in the frequency band fce < f < 2fce, which may165\ncontain contributions from both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves166\nand thermal noise, tend to be excluded from the high density region inside the plasmapause167\n[Meredith et al., 2004]. Therefore we adopt the criterion, based on a previous experimental168\nstudy using data from the CRRES Plasma Wave Experiment, that the wave amplitude for169\nfrequencies in the range fce < f < 2fce must be less than 0.0005 mV m\n\u22121 for observations170\nto be regarded as inside the plasmapause.171\nIntense broadband electrostatic noise, extending from 100 Hz to several kHz, may be172\npresent outside the plasmapause during enhanced magnetic activity, especially on the173\nnight-side [e.g., Roeder et al., 1991]. These emissions, which could contaminate the obser-174\nvations of the magnetosonic waves, were removed from the database using the following175\ncriteria. If the emissions at 1.5fLHR are greater than 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 mV2 m\u22122 Hz\u22121 and the176\nemission at 1.5fLHR lies within a factor of 5 of the emission at 0.75fLHR then the emissions177\nwere excluded from the database. This condition was only applied to observations outside178\nthe plasmapause.179\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 10 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\n4. Identification of magnetosonic waves\nSince calibrated wave magnetic field data in the frequency range above 100 Hz are not180\navailable for CRRES, we have had to identify magnetosonic waves from the wave electric181\nfield antenna alone. Since magnetosonic waves are known to be strongest within 2 \u2212 3o182\nof the magnetic equator, the wave data were spilt into different latitude ranges, to help183\nidentify the waves.184\nFigure 1 shows the average wave electric field spectral intensities outside the plasma-185\npause for all the CRRES data for (top) equatorial (|\u03bbm| < 3o) and (bottom) off-equatorial186\n(5o < |\u03bbm| < 10o) wave emissions for different levels of geomagnetic activity as measured187\nby AE\u2217, where AE\u2217 is the maximum value of the AE index in the previous 3 hours. Here188\nand henceforth, average values of a particular quantity are determined by computing the189\narithmetic mean of the appropriate rebinned CRRES data as a function of the chosen190\nparameters, subject to the prescribed conditions, and subsequently plotted using a loga-191\nrithmic scale. Near the magnetic equator (top row) there are strong wave emissions below192\nfLHR (dashed line) for all levels of AE\u2217 but there is a tendency for wave power to become193\nstronger and extend to lower frequencies and lower L with increasing AE\u2217. There is a194\nclear upper frequency cut off to the emissions that follows fLHR.195\nAt higher latitudes outside the plasmapause, and for weak magnetic activity (Fig 1,196\nbottom left), strong wave emissions are observed below fLHR but they appear more con-197\nfined in L than those near the magnetic equator (top left). More generally, emissions198\nbelow fLHR at high latitudes (bottom panels) tend to be much weaker than those near199\nthe magnetic equator (top panels), particularly for medium and high magnetic activity.200\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 11\nWhistler mode chorus waves are observed at higher frequencies in bands just above201\nand below 0.5fce (dotted line) and reveal the double-banded nature reported by previous202\nworkers [Tsurutani and Smith, 1974]. The power of these waves increases with magnetic203\nactivity as has been reported before [e.g., Tsurutani and Smith, 1974, 1977; Meredith et al.,204\n2001, 2003b], but note that chorus detected here is stronger above the magnetic equator205\nthan near the equator. This probably reflects the growth and propagation characteristics206\nof the waves [Bortnik et al., 2007a, 2007b]. At higher frequencies ECH waves are observed207\nbetween the harmonics of fce. These waves are also substorm-dependent [e.g., Meredith et208\nal., 2000] and are closely confined to the magnetic equator due to propagation conditions209\n[e.g., Horne, 1988, 1989].210\nThe average wave electric field spectral intensities inside the plasmasphere are shown211\nin Figure 2 in the same format as Figure 1. Here the most intense emissions are below212\nfLHR near the magnetic equator (top panels). The band of emissions extends to lower213\nfrequencies with increasing magnetic activity, AE\u2217, but wave power can be very intense214\nfor both low and high levels of AE\u2217. Note that during the most active conditions (top215\nright) power extends between 3 \u2264 L \u2264 5. The weaker emissions between 100 - 800 Hz216\nwith spectral intensities of the order of 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 mV2 m\u22122 Hz\u22121 that do not exhibit a217\ncut-off at fLHR are likely to be plasmaspheric hiss. At higher frequencies just above and218\nbelow 0.5fce is interesting to note that there is very little chorus wave power inside the219\nplasmasphere compared to the higher powers observed outside, which suggests that chorus220\nis not easily generated inside the plasmasphere.221\nThe analysis shown in Figures 1 and 2 shows that wave emissions below fLHR near the222\nmagnetic equator between |\u03bbm| < 3o are much stronger than those at higher latitudes223\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 12 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\n5o < |\u03bbm| < 10o whether inside or outside the plasmapause, and for each level of magnetic224\nactivity as measured by AE\u2217. Chorus wave power does not extend down below fLHR, but225\nplasmspheric hiss may be present near and above the magnetic equator, and propagation226\nstudies show that it can propagate across the magnetic equator to higher latitudes [e.g.,227\nChurch and Thorne, 1983]. Similarly, impulsive signals originating from lightning which228\nmerge into a continuum after multiple reflections inside the plasmasphere [e.g., Bortnik et229\nal., 2003] may also contribute to emissions at and above the magnetic equator, although230\nthe main contribution is at frequencies above 2 kHz [Meredith et al., 2006]. However, the231\nrapid increase in wave power within 3o of the magnetic equator, and the confinement of232\nstrong wave power to below fLHR, indicates an additional wave emission is present, both233\ninside and outside the plasmapause. It is possible that some of this equatorial wave power234\nis due to electrostatic waves. However, between fcH and fLHR the refractive index surface235\nof the whistler mode branch is closed and the waves are electromagnetic. Electrostatic236\nion cyclotron waves could exist between the harmonics of nfcH , up to and including the237\nlower hybrid resonance frequency, and are analogous to ECH waves between nfce up238\nto an including the upper hybrid frequency. However, theory shows that these waves239\nshould be Landau damped by thermal (1-10 eV) electrons [Ashour Abdalla and Thorne,240\n1977]. In addition, analysis of equatorial noise near L = 4.5 using CLUSTER, which241\nhas both electric and magnetic wave instruments, has not identified any electrostatic242\nion-cyclotron waves at the equator as far as we are aware [e.g., Santolik et al., 2002,243\n2004; Nemec et al., 2005, 2006]. As a result, and since observations by other satellites244\nshow that magnetosonic waves are observed very close to the magnetic equator, and245\npropagation studies show that the largest wave growth occurs near the magnetic equator246\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 13\nwhere Landau damping by plasmasheet (0.1 to few keV) electrons is a minimum, for247\nthe purposes of this paper we identify the band of waves between 0.5fLHR < f < fLHR248\nfor |\u03bbm| < 3o as fast magnetosonic waves whilst recognizing that there could be a small249\ncontribution to the emissions from plasmaspheric hiss and even smaller from lightning250\ngenerated whistlers. We also note this excludes magnetosonic waves if they occur at251\nhigher latitudes. Furthermore, magnetosonic wave power at frequencies below 0.5fLHR,252\nwhere the probability of occurrence maximises [Nemec et al., 2005], will not be captured253\nby this survey. As mentioned above, surveying the frequency band of 0.5fLHR < f < fLHR254\nrepresents a balance between capturing the intense power of the waves and being able to255\nperform a statistical survey with a reasonable coverage in L.256\n5. MLT distribution of magnetsonic waves\nThe MLT distribution of the average magnetosonic electric field wave intensity for257\n0.5fLHR < f < fLHR outside the plasmapause is shown in Figure 3 for three levels of258\nAE\u2217 (top panels). The plots extend linearly out to L = 8 with noon at the top and dawn259\nto the right. The sampling distributions are shown by the small inset panels. CRRES has260\na limited coverage of these wave emissions. Wave power increases with increasing AE\u2217,261\nmainly for L > 3, and strong waves are observed for L > 3 mainly at dusk between 15:00262\n- 22:00 MLT and in the post midnight sector between 01:00 - 04:00 MLT. Coverage in L263\nis very limited on the dayside, but strong waves are observed for high magnetic activity264\nnear noon between 4 < L < 5 and at 2 < L < 3. For comparison, waves in the same265\nfrequency range at higher latitudes (5o < |\u03bbm| < 10o bottom panels) show some tendency266\nto increase with AE\u2217, mainly on the dayside, but they remain much weaker than the267\nmagnetosonic waves at the equator.268\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 14 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nInside the plamasphere (Figure 4) magnetosonic waves (top panels) are most enhanced269\nduring active conditions on the dusk-side for L > 3. The lack of coverage on the dawn-270\nside in the region L > 4 during active conditions is due to the fact that the plasmasphere271\nis eroded at these times, with an outer boundary typically inside L = 4 [Carpenter and272\nAnderson, 1992]. The results suggest either that magnetosonic waves can be generated273\ninside the plasmasphere, or that propagation from outside to inside the plasmasphere is274\npossible at dusk, but not at dawn. For comparison, emissions at higher latitudes in the275\nsame frequency range are observed from dawn to dusk inside the plasmapause on the276\ndayside. This rather different MLT distribution of higher latitude emissions inside the277\nplasmasphere suggests that they are more likely to be another type of emission such as278\nplasmaspheric hiss.279\n6. Spatial distribution of 16.5 keV protons\nA number of theoretical studies have shown that magnetosonic waves can be generated280\nby a proton ring distribution in velocity space, or more specifically, a ring corresponding to281\na positive gradient in the perpendicular velocity distribution of the protons which exceeds282\nthe local Alfve\u00b4n speed [e.g., Curtis and Wu, 1979; Sharma and Patel, 1986; Boardsen et283\nal., 1992; Horne et al., 2000]. Wave growth should be sensitive not only to the energy284\nof the ring distribution, but also to the number of resonant protons in the ring. Thus to285\nhelp understand the wave observations here we present the results of analyzing the proton286\ndistribution measured by the LEPA instrument on CRRES. We use the flux at one energy,287\n16.5 keV, as a measure of the particles whose drift trajectories are mainly determined by288\nthe convection electric field.289\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 15\nFigure 5 shows the average proton differential number flux, J\u22a5, for pitch angles of 90o290\nat 16.5 keV. To ensure that the data are statistically significant, the background was first291\nsubtracted and the data then binned in L in steps of 0.1L for each half orbit. The data292\nwere only included in the subsequent analysis if the number of counts in each 0.1L bin293\nexceeded 50. The data were then binned again in MLT, latitude and for inside outside294\nor plasmapause for each activity level. The analysis was restricted to the region L > 2.1295\nto exclude contamination from the proton radiation belt. Outside the plasmasphere (top296\npanels) the proton flux increases with AE\u2217, and is considerably enhanced during active297\nconditions for 3 < L < 6 between 17:00 MLT through midnight to 05:00 MLT. This sug-298\ngests that proton injection occurs over a broad range of MLT. Weaker enhancements occur299\nin the post-noon MLT sector. Conversely, there is some indication that the proton flux300\nin the pre-noon sector 07:00 - 10:00 MLT actually decreases with increasing AE\u2217. Inside301\nthe plasmapause (bottom panels) again the flux increases with AE\u2217 and is considerably302\nenhanced during active conditions between 14:00 - 23:00 MLT. There is no evidence for303\nincreased proton flux near dawn inside the plasmapause during active conditions and the304\nflux there remains low.305\n7. Spatial distribution of proton rings\nProton ring distributions are an important source of free energy that can drive mag-\nnetosonic waves. To identify proton rings the proton differential number flux, J , was\nconverted to phase space density, f , using\nf =\nJ\np2\n(1)\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 16 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nwhere p is the proton momentum. An examination of the energy dependence of f as a\nfunction of half orbit and L showed that positive gradients \u2202f\/\u2202v\u22a5 > 0 typically exist\nover \u223c 4 (log) energy channels of the LEPA instrument, roughly corresponding to a factor\nof 2 in energy. A ring distribution was identified according to the criteria that for any\ngiven value of f at some energy E, the value of f must be higher at the next three or\nmore consecutive energies. This criteria tends to be rather stringent in that it rules out\nany plateau type distributions that could have been formed as a result of wave particle\ndiffusion, but should provide an unambiguous method of detection. The energy of the\nring ER, defined to be the energy of the peak in the phase space density, and the Alfve\u00b4n\nenergy EA, were recorded for each distribution where\nEA =\n1\n2\nmHv\n2\nA (2)\nmH is the proton mass, vA is the Alfve\u00b4n velocity given by\nvA = c\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221afcefcH\nf 2pe\n=\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a B20\n\u00b50nHmH\n(3)\nwhere nH is the proton number density, and an electron-hydrogen plasma has been as-306\nsumed.307\nExamples of proton ring distributions identified by this technique are shown in Figure308\n6a. Here the proton phase space density for v = v\u22a5 is plotted as a function of energy for309\nthree different times during the outbound pass of orbit 714 on 14th May 1991. During310\nthis orbit a proton ring was observed between 3.95 < L < 5.45, while the spacecraft was311\nwithin 2.5o of the magnetic equator. The peak energy of the proton ring lies in the range312\n6 - 12 keV during this interval and is higher than the Alfve\u00b4n energy. Strong magnetosonic313\nwaves below fLHR are also observed in the CRRES plasma wave data at 19:51 UT and314\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 17\n20:14 UT (Figure 6b) near 17:00 MLT, consistent with the idea that proton rings are the315\nsource of the waves. At 21:00 UT the spacecraft is at L = 5.45 and the lower hybrid316\nfrequency is below the lowest frequency channel of the wave instrument but a proton ring317\ndistribution is still present. Note that the waves are particularly strong in a low density318\nregion where the plasma frequency drops by a factor of 2. In this event the proton ring319\nis present for more than 1 hour over a range of L indicating that proton rings can occur320\nover a large region of space and persist for a significant amount of time.321\nThe spatial distribution of proton rings during active conditions outside the plasmapause322\nwithin 10o of the magnetic equator is shown in the top left panel of Figure 7. The rings323\nare observed from 12 MLT through midnight to 06 MLT over a range of L (3 < L < 7).324\nThe spatial distribution of the proton rings that satisfy the criteria ER > EA is shown in325\nthe upper central panel of Figure 7. Most of the proton rings on the dusk side satisfy the326\ncriteria for wave growth whereas the majority of the rings between midnight and dawn327\ndo not. The corresponding distribution of magnetosonic waves is shown in the upper328\nright panel of Figure 7 for direct comparison. Although wave coverage is limited, the329\nlocation of waves on the dusk-side agrees reasonably well with the occurrence of proton330\nring distributions with ER > EA whereas there is very little agreement between proton331\nrings with ER > EA and waves between midnight and dawn.332\nThe bottom panels of Figure 7 show the results for the case inside the plasmapause.333\nHere, proton rings are observed primarily on the dusk-side, in the region 3 < L < 7,334\nfrom 15 to 22 MLT. The majority of these proton rings satisfy the criteria ER > EA335\nand correspond to the region of enhanced magnetosonic wave power. However, there are336\nalmost no proton rings or waves between midnight and dawn.337\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 18 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nThe Alfve\u00b4n energy varies as a function of position and location with respect to the338\nplasmapause. This variability could have a significant effect on the condition for insta-339\nbility, ER > EA. To examine this possibility in more detail the CRRES database was340\nused to calculate the average equatorial (10o < |\u03bbm| < 10o) Alfve\u00b4n energy as a function341\nof L and magnetic local time. The average Alfve\u00b4n energy, \u3008EA\u3009, and ER are shown for342\nL = 4.05\u00b10.15 and L = 6.55\u00b10.15 both inside and outside the plasmapause in Figure 8.343\nThe maximum proton ring energy is limited to the highest energy channel of the LEPA344\ninstrument which is \u223c30 keV. Inside the plasmasphere (bottom panels) ER > \u3008EA\u3009 at all345\nlocal times. In contrast, outside the plasmapause \u3008EA\u3009 varies substantially as a function346\nof local time, with highest values (\u223c 35 keV) between dawn and noon and a minimum of347\naround 5 keV near dusk. Therefore, even though there are a significant number of proton348\nring distributions occurring between midnight and dawn the conditions are not favorable349\nfor wave growth due to the higher Alfve\u00b4n energy.350\n8. Discussion\nThe close coincidence between the MLT distribution of magnetosonic waves inside the351\nplasmapause and proton ring distributions with ER > EA suggests that proton rings are352\nthe source of free energy driving the waves. Outside the plasmapause a similar conclusion353\ncan be made about the waves observed on the dusk sector, but the waves observed near354\ndawn require more interpretation.355\nTo understand the MLT distribution of magnetosonic wave power it is important to356\nunderstand the injection and drift of protons during periods of enhanced convection.357\nDuring active conditions 16 keV protons can penetrate to as low as L = 3 for a range358\nof MLT on the nightside extending from dusk to dawn (Figure 5, top right). Within the359\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 19\nenergy range of the LEPA instrument (E < 30 keV) the drift paths of protons should be360\ndominated by the convection electric field outside the plasmasphere. The drift paths are361\nusually computed for constant first adiabatic invariant \u00b5, and for reference \u00b5 = 1.4 MeV\/G362\nfor 16.5 keV protons at L = 3 in a dipole magnetic field at the equator. Simulations show363\nthat an enhancement in the convection electric field representative of storm times can364\ninject protons with \u00b5 = 3 MeV\/G to as low as L = 3 over a range of MLT very similar to365\nthat observed in Figure 5 [Chen et al., 1993]. As the protons drift to lower L the gradient366\ndrift becomes more important and drift trajectories can take the particles through dusk367\ntowards the dayside. On the dawn side there is a separatrix between open and closed368\ndrift paths that moves closer to the Earth as the convection electric field is increased.369\nThe separatrix limits direct convective access to an MLT region that is typically earlier370\nthan dawn. Protons outside the separatrix at dawn (i.e., farther away from the Earth at371\ndawn), and similarly outside the separatrix at dusk, follow open drift paths to the dayside.372\nChanges in the separatrix can result in trapping of some protons on closed drift paths and373\ndevelopment of the ring current. Therefore the observed increase in the 16.5 keV proton374\nflux outside the plasmasphere is most likely due to direct convective access whereas the375\nreduction in flux observed between dawn and noon is probably due to the lack of direct376\nconvective access and decay of the pre-existing proton flux.377\nThe proton flux inside the plasmapause during active conditions has a different MLT378\ndistribution that extends from near midnight through dusk to noon. Protons may be ob-379\nserved inside the plasmasphere as a result of time variations in the convection electric field380\nso that the plasmasphere is partially refilled and overlaps the region of proton injection.381\nThe data may also include observations of enhanced flux inside plumes which are known382\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 20 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\nto develop on the dayside and afternoon. In general, the distribution is consistent with383\nproton injection as discussed above [see also Chen et al., 1994].384\nAfter proton injection the formation of proton rings is generally ascribed to losses as385\na result of slow drift over a select range of energies [Jordanova et al., 1994; Fok et al.,386\n1996]. For positively charged particles the co-rotation drift velocity at dusk is oppositely387\ndirected to the gradient and E \u00d7 B drift. This leads to a range of energies for which the388\ndrift velocity is very slow resulting in a depletion in the proton distribution due to losses389\nas a result of charge exchange and Coulomb collisions. If the losses are sufficiently high390\nthen as higher energy protons drift through the same region an energy dependent proton391\nring distribution may form. In particular, for quiet periods simulations show that there is392\na range of \u00b5 < 1 MeV\/G for which protons may execute \u2018banana\u2019 shaped drift paths near393\ndusk [Chen et al., 1994] and thus may have an extended dwell time near dusk. This may394\nresult in a region where proton rings are more likely to form and may explain the larger395\nnumber of proton ring distributions observed near dusk and the corresponding increase396\nin wave power. Since the energy of protons executing banana orbits may depend on the397\nstrength of the convection electric field this may also determine the energy of the proton398\nrings.399\nThe relationship between magnetosonic waves at dawn and proton ring distributions is400\nmore complex. Although proton rings are observed, since ER < EA it appears that low401\nenergy protons (E < 30 keV) are not the source of the waves seen outside the plasmapause402\nbefore dawn. There are a number of possibilities. First, a stagnation point resulting in403\nbanana orbits can also occur near dawn when the difference between the gradient and404\nco-rotation drifts is approximately equal to the E \u00d7 B convection drift. This occurs for405\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 21\nhigher energies than that at dusk [Chen et al., 1994] and thus proton ring distributions may406\nbe present at energies above the maximum energy of LEPA. Second, since magnetosonic407\nwaves can propagate long distances both radially and azimuthally near the magnetic equa-408\ntor the waves may have propagated from a remote source region. Finally, the waves may409\nbe magnetosonic but produced by another process such as nonlinear wave-wave coupling.410\nMagnetosonic waves are enhanced during active conditions over most local times outside411\nthe plasmaspause and on the dusk-side inside the plasmapause. Electrons with energies412\nup to a few hundred keV can be injected into the outer radiation belt by enhanced storm-413\ntime convection electric fields [Baker et al., 1998; Obara et al., 2000]. The motion of414\nthese electrons is subsequently dominated by gradient and curvature drifts, leading to415\nclosed drift orbits about the Earth on the timescale of the order of an hour or so. During416\nactive periods these so-called seed electrons may encounter enhanced magnetosonic waves417\nin the equatorial plane for the bulk of their drift orbits. This could include exposure to418\nmagnetosonic waves both inside and outside the plasmapause. Since magnetosonic waves419\ncan energize electrons both inside and outside the plasmapause [Horne et al., 2007] our420\nobservations suggest that they could play a significant role in the acceleration of a seed421\npopulation of electrons to relativistic energies. Work is now in progress to quantify the422\nrole of these waves in radiation belt dynamics.423\nMagnetosonic waves in the frequency range fcH < f < 0.5fLHR, where the probability424\nof occurrence maximises [Nemec et al., 2005], are excluded from the survey due to the425\n100 Hz low frequency limit of the CRRES Plasma Wave Experiment combined with the426\nrequirement of reasonable coverage in L. The interaction of the waves with proton ring427\ndistributions could be quite strong, if not stronger, in this frequency range [e.g., Perraut428\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nX - 22 MEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES\net al., 1982; Laakso et al., 1990, Horne et al., 2000] suggesting that the observed proton429\nrings may also be a source of waves at lower frequencies. Future statistical surveys,430\nusing instrumentation that extends to lower frequencies, are required to study the spatial431\ndistribution of these waves.432\n9. Conclusions\nWe have performed a statistical analysis of fast magnetosonic waves and the occurrence433\nof proton ring distributions using wave and particle data from the CRRES spacecraft.434\nDue to the restricted frequency coverage the wave survey was confined to waves with435\nfrequencies in the range 0.5fLHR < f < fLHR. The main conclusions of this study are436\n1. The average intensity of fast magnetosonic waves increases with increasing AE\u2217,437\nsuggesting that they are related to periods of enhanced convective electric field and or438\nsubstorms.439\n2. Over the range of L covered by the wave survey 2.5 \u2264 L \u2264 4.5 intense emissions are440\nobserved at most local times outside the plasmapause, but are restricted to the dusk-side441\ninside the plasmapause. The most intense waves generally occur near L = 3\u2212 4.442\n3. The MLT distribution of low energy proton rings, ER < 30 keV with energies greater443\nthan the Alfve\u00b4n energy ER > EA closely matches the MLT distribution of magnetosonic444\nwaves inside the plasmapause, and outside the plasmapause on the dusk side, and suggests445\nthat proton ring distributions are a likely source of energy driving the waves. We suggest446\nthat \u2018banana\u2019 type drift orbits near dusk, which result in long dwell times, and losses are447\nimportant for producing proton ring distributions and hence magnetosonic waves near448\ndusk.449\nD R A F T January 15, 2008, 6:28am D R A F T\nMEREDITH ET AL.: MAGNETOSONIC WAVES X - 23\n4. Proton ring distributions and intense magnetosonic waves are found outside the450\nplasmapause between midnight and dawn which do not satisfy the condition ER > EA for451\ninstability due to the high Alfve\u00b4n speed in that region. Although proton rings at energies452\n> 30 keV could drive the instabilities the source of these waves is yet to be properly453\nidentified.454\nSince magnetosonic waves are generated by protons and can cause electron acceleration455\nup to \u223c MeV energies inside the radiation belts [Horne et al., 2007] they are likely to456\nprovide an important energy transfer process between the ring current and the outer457\nelectron radiation belt.458\nAcknowledgments.
