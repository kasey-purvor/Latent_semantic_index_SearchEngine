Basalts that are depleted in the most incompatible trace \nelements possess a wide range in 3He\/4He but most ratios are similar to or higher than those \nof mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB: ~8RA [1]). The low concentrations of helium in these \nrocks suggest that significant degassing has made them susceptible to contamination by low-\n3He\/4He crust, therefore all measured 3He\/4He are considered minimum estimates for their \nsources. Elevated helium isotope ratios in the source of these rocks result from interaction \nwith high-3He\/4He mantle. The highest oxygen isotope ratios in the depleted rocks are similar \nto those in melts from typical depleted upper mantle and the range of \u03b418O values is \nconsistent with variable, limited amounts of contamination by Icelandic crust. \nMost of the incompatible trace element-enriched rocks possess 3He\/4He ratios that are similar \nto or lower than those in MORB. These rocks were erupted close to the postulated centre of \nthe Iceland plume. This observation contradicts models in which high-3He\/4He characterises \nthe focus of mantle upwelling, and a source with MORB-like 3He\/4He ratios may be common \nto other parts of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. The highest \u03b418O values in the enriched \nrocks are lower than those in MORB and do not appear to have been affected by interaction \nwith low-\u03b418O Icelandic crust. Recycling of hydrothermally altered oceanic crust that has \nbeen subducted into the mantle provides a plausible mechanism for generating an 18O-poor \nsource with the trace element and isotopic characteristics of the enriched lavas. \nKeywords: Iceland, helium, oxygen, isotopes, mantle, recycling \n \n \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    3  \n1. Introduction \nIceland is a subaerial section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, distinguished by anomalously thick \ncrust [2], where volcanism occurs primarily along neovolcanic zones. Lavas from Iceland and \nthe adjacent ridge sections display significant Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic variation which can be \nexplained through contributions from several components that are both incompatible element \nenriched and depleted compared to normal mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) (e.g. [3-5]). \nThe age of the Icelandic crust limits the degree to which Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic variation can \nbe generated through in situ radioactive in-growth: therefore, irrespective of the extent of \ncrustal assimilation, an inescapable conclusion from geochemical studies is that distinct \nmantle domains exist beneath Iceland. \nGeophysical studies also demonstrate the distinctive nature of the Icelandic mantle. For \nexample, seismic wave velocities are slower beneath Iceland than surrounding regions, \nconsistent with the presence of anomalously hot mantle [6-8]. To date, there is no consensus \nas to the depth at which the heat anomaly originates or whether it is associated with active \n(plume) or passive mantle upwelling. While some studies have attempted to reconcile \ngeophysical observations of Icelandic mantle and the geochemical diversity revealed in the \nisland\u2019s volcanic products [9,10], no consensus has been reached on their relationship. \nIn this contribution, we concentrate on two isotopic systems (He and O) with proven potential \nfor tracing heterogeneity in mantle-derived lavas [11,12]. We focus on central Iceland \u2013 at the \nconvergence of the neovolcanic zones \u2013 which is the proposed centre of mantle upwelling in \nthe region [6]. New measurements of helium concentrations and helium and oxygen isotope \nratios of hyaloclastic glasses and phenocrysts in subaerial lavas are presented. These \ndemonstrate the variable extent of crust-mantle interaction in central Iceland and the isotopic \nheterogeneity of He and O in the mantle source region. By identifying samples unaffected by \ncrustal interaction, we show that He and O isotopes reveal information about both the nature \nof mantle sources contributing to volcanism in central Iceland and the complexity of their \nspatial distribution. \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    4  \n2. Samples \nThe neovolcanic zones of Iceland can be subdivided into the western and northern branches, \nwhich erupt tholeiitic lavas, and an eastern branch which produces mainly Fe-Ti basalts and \nalkali basalts. This study focuses on subglacial glasses and subaerial olivine tholeiite lava \nflows from central Iceland, at the convergence of the northern (NRZ) and western rift zones \n(WRZ) (Table 1 and Fig. 1), where fissure-fed and central edifice volcanoes occur. Optically \nunaltered glass was collected from subglacial pillow lavas, some of which contain olivine \nphenocrysts. The lava flows generally contain abundant olivine phenocrysts set in a fine-\ngrained plagioclase, pyroxene and glass matrix. NAL 625 contains augite phenocrysts, as \ndoes NAL 626 which also contains abundant (~30%) plagioclase phenocrysts that are \nglomerophyric and\/or optically zoned. The central Iceland samples are supplemented by \nglasses and lavas from the NRZ (Th-29) and Eastern Rift Zone (ERZ; SAL-575 and THJOR). \n3. Analytical Techniques \nCrushing in vacuo was used to release helium from inclusions in olivine and clinopyroxene \nphenocrysts and from vesicles in glasses. Fresh glass and phenocrysts were separated \nmanually from coarsely crushed rock. Separates, free of adhering matrix, were cleaned \nultrasonically in ethanol then dried prior to loading into two on-line crushing devices [13]. \nShort crush times were employed to help avoid the release of extraneous He contained in \ncrystal lattice sites [14]. Gas liberated by crushing was expanded into a stainless steel \npreparation line. Helium was isolated from other gases by sequential exposure to (i) a Ti \ngetter at 750\u00baC, decreasing to 400\u00baC, (ii) a liquid nitrogen-cooled charcoal trap, (iii) a \nSAES\u00a9 Zr-Al getter operated at room temperature, and (iv) a liquid He-cooled charcoal trap. \nHelium was then expanded into a split-tube, dual collection He-isotope mass spectrometer \n(GAD) for 3He\/4He analysis using established protocols [15]. Raw helium isotope ratios were \nnormalised using standard aliquots of SIO air (3He\/4He ratio of 1.4 \u00d7 10-6 = 1RA) and gas \nfrom Murdering Mudpots, Yellowstone National Park (= 16.45RA). Ne was monitored on \nevery run to correct 3He\/4He ratios for the effects of air contamination (<2% for all samples). \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    5  \nBlanks were measured by operating the crusher (~70 beats per minute) for the same duration \n(150s) as sample analysis, and averaged 0.67 x 10-9 cm3 STP4He (\u00b10.55, 2\u03c3). All unknowns \nhave been corrected for the presence of such a blank. \nOxygen isotope analyses were performed on fresh glass and inclusion-free mafic minerals. \nThese were separated by hand and ultrasonically cleaned in MQ-H2O and methanol. \u03b418O\u2021 \nvalues were measured at Royal Holloway, University of London on 1-2mg splits using \nestablished laser fluorination protocols for glasses [11] and phenocrysts [16]. Yields for all \nunknowns and standards in this study were 95\u00b15%. The precision and accuracy of analyses \nwas monitored by three internal standards; two different olivines from San Carlos and a \ngarnet. The isotopic composition of these minerals relative to the international standard \nbiotite NBS-30 (\u03b418O = 5.10\u2030), and 2\u03c3 deviations of replicate analyses over the analytical \nperiod were: RHUL SCOL I = +4.84\u2030 (\u00b10.18, n=23), RHUL SCOL II = +5.22\u2030 (\u00b10.16, \nn=19) and UW GMG 2 garnet = +5.71\u2030 (\u00b10.18, n=22). \nMajor element analyses were performed at the Nordic Volcanological Institute. \nConcentrations in glass were measured using an ARL-SEMQ microprobe and whole rocks \npowders were fused to glass and measured by ICP-AES, with analytical precision of better \nthan \u00b13% [17]. Trace elements were determined on small (<3mm diameter) disaggregated \nshards of glass or powdered lava using a Perkin Elmer ELAN 6000 inductively coupled \nplasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) at the University of Durham [18]. The data were \ncalibrated relative to international standards, with reproducibility better than \u00b12% for all \nelements except Pb which was better than \u00b15%. Data for NAL 611 is published in Breddam \n[17].  \n                                                 \n\u2021 \u03b418On is the per mille (\u2030) deviation of 18O\/16O in n from the international standard (std) V-SMOW given by \nthe relationship: \u03b418On = 1000 \u00d7 (18O\/16On \/ 18O\/16Ostd -1) \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    6  \n4. Results \n4.1 Major and Trace element results \nAll samples are tholeiitic in composition. The glasses display a restricted range of \ncompositions with MgO contents varying from 12.5 to 5.0 wt. % (Table 2). Trace elements \nare enriched relative to primitive mantle by factors up to 40 for the high field strength \nelements (HFSEs) Nb and Ta, 25 for light rare earth elements (LREEs) and 8 for heavy rare \nearth elements (HREEs, Table 3). Trace element concentrations and Sr and Nd isotopic ratios \ncan be used to define three groups of glasses (Figs. 2 & 3). Group 1 range from pronounced \nLREE depletion to mild LREE enrichment ((La\/Yb)n = 0.33-1.77, (La\/Sm)n = 0.44-1.12, \n(Sm\/Yb)n = 0.75-1.51) and possess lower 87Sr\/86Sr and higher 143Nd\/144Nd than the other \ngroups. Group 2 glasses have similar HREE contents to Group 1 but greater LREE \nenrichment ((La\/Yb)n = 2.82-3.36, (La\/Sm)n = 1.44-1.53, (Sm\/Yb)n = 1.96-2.20). Group 3 \nglasses have the highest incompatible element concentrations but have patterns that are very \nsimilar to Group 2 ((La\/Yb)n = 3.58-3.89, (La\/Sm)n = 1.60-1.64, (Sm\/Yb)n = 2.19-2.40). \nGlasses of Groups 2 and 3 also display very similar Sr and Nd isotopic ratios that are distinct \nfrom Group 1 (Fig. 3). All glasses display relative enrichment of Ta and Nb (all have positive \n\u0394Nb [19]) and depletion in Pb, with respect to neighbouring elements. Group 1 generally \ndisplays positive Ba and Sr anomalies. Positive Ba anomalies also appear in Group 2, while \nin Group 3 the Ba anomaly is absent and Sr is depleted relative to neighbouring elements \n(Fig. 2a). \nThe lava samples all have >7 wt. % MgO. Their normalised trace element patterns are \ncomparable with previously published data (e.g. [9,20]) and can be split into two groups: \nLREE-enriched (NAL-625 and THJOR) with (La\/Yb)n = 2.36-4.02, (La\/Sm)n = 1.20-1.64 \nand (Sm\/Yb)n = 1.97-2.34, and LREE-depleted (Th-29, NAL-688) with (La\/Yb)n = 0.27-0.37, \n(La\/Sm)n = 0.35-0.43 and (Sm\/Yb)n = 0.75-0.77. Depleted lava from Theistareykir (Th-29) \nresembles the most depleted Group 1 glass, but enriched THJOR also falls mainly within the \nrange of Group 1 (Fig. 2b). While the most enriched lava (NAL-625) has higher La\/Yb and \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    7  \nSm\/Yb than the glasses, it more closely resembles Group 1 than Group 2 in having \nprogressive relative depletion of elements more incompatible than Nb. \n4.2 He isotope results \nHelium isotope ratios (3He\/4He) and concentrations ([He]) are reported in Table 1 with \nsample locations shown in Figure 1. Glass and phenocryst samples from central Iceland are \ncharacterised by a wide range in 3He\/4He ratios encompassing high-3He hotspot ratios (>> \n8RA), through MORB-like values (8RA \u00b1 1 [15]) to values considerably lower than MORB \nindicating a significant contribution of radiogenic He. \nThe highest 3He\/4He of 34.3RA, for NAL-625 from Vadalda just north of the Vatnaj\u00f6kull \nIcecap (Fig. 1), is significantly greater than any other He isotope ratio reported for Iceland\u2019s \nneovolcanic zones (\u2264 26.2RA [21,22]). The 3He\/4He of Vadalda is comparable with the \nhighest value of older volcanic successions at Selardalur, northwest Iceland (37.7RA [23]), \nand is higher than those of olivines from Tertiary lavas throughout the North Atlantic Igneous \nProvince [24-26] except for Baffin Island picrites [27]. The 3He\/4He ratio of this sample is \nalso similar to rocks from Loihi Seamount, Hawaii, and the Galapagos islands, the only other \nmodern day ocean islands to register helium isotope ratios greater than 25RA [28-31]. \nVadalda clinopyroxene phenocrysts possess lower 3He\/4He than co-existing olivine (Table 1). \nSuch an effect has been observed previously and attributed to preferential capture of \nradiogenic He in the pyroxene lattice [32]. However, the clinopyroxene 3He\/4He is still higher \nthan most of the samples in the present sample suite as well as samples analysed previously \nfrom central Iceland [9], corroborating the high-3He\/4He source inferred for this particular \nlocality. Lava NAL-625 has the highest La\/Yb measured in this work but, as noted above, \nbears some similarities to Group 1 glasses. \nHelium isotope ratios significantly greater than MORB occur in glasses and phenocrysts at \nfive further localities in central Iceland (Fig. 1): Fjallsendi (17.3RA), Kistufell (16.6RA), \nGaesahjukur (17.6RA), Ketildyngja (10.6RA) and Bardarbunga (21.9RA). These locations lie \ntowards the northern and western parts of the study area. The value obtained for the \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    8  \nBardarbunga glass compares well with other reported values in the immediate area [21]. We \nalso found elevated 3He\/4He for the NRZ sample from Theistareykir (12.2RA) and the SRZ \nlavas from Solheimaj\u00f6kull (14.6RA) and Thjorsardalur (18.3RA). \nMORB-like 3He\/4He ratios characterise six localities in central Iceland: Herdubreid, Eggert, \nJardfraedingaslod, Upptyppingar, Trolladyngja and Odadahraun (Table 1; Fig. 4). These \nlocations lie immediately north of Vatnaj\u00f6kull and mainly cluster round the most elevated \n3He\/4He sample from Vadalda (Fig. 1). As with high-3He\/4He samples, MORB-like helium \nisotope ratios occur in both phenocrysts and glass. The glasses contain the greatest He \nconcentrations (up to 127 x 10-9 cm3STP\/g) but some low He concentration olivines (e.g. \nTRO-53) also possess MORB-like 3He\/4He (Fig. 4). Two glass samples (Herdubreid, Eggert) \nbelong to Group 1, five to Group 2 (Jardfraedingaslod, Upptyppingar and Ketildyngja) and \nthe remaining two are lavas for which trace element data are not available (Table 1). \nHelium isotope ratios lower than those in MORB were found for four samples: glasses from \nUpptyppingar, Hvannalindir and Jardfraedingaslod, and olivine phenocrysts from the centre \nof the Eggert pillow lava. The three low-3He\/4He glasses comprise all of Group 3 and have \nlow He concentrations (Fig. 4). Upptyppingar and Hvannalindir both have [He] < 1 x 10-9 \ncm3STP\/g and the Jardfraedingaslod glass has the lowest [He] from this locality. Like Group \n2, the Group 3 glasses occur only immediately north of Vatnaj\u00f6kull (Fig. 1). It is notable that \nolivines from the centre of the Eggert lava (NAL-688) have a lower 3He\/4He value (5.9RA) \ncompared with olivines picked from the rim (8.0RA) and from the glass phase (8.8RA). This \nunusual observation may reflect capture of some xenocrystic olivine by this sample. \n4.3 O isotope results \nCentral Icelandic glasses possess \u03b418O values in the range +3.31 to +4.82\u2030 (Table 1). The \n\u03b418O values of glasses are lower than basaltic glasses from oceanic and backarc spreading \ncentres [11,33-35] but their upper limit is similar to four values previously obtained from \nKistufell [17]. Oxygen isotope ratios in olivine phenocrysts (\u03b418Ool) vary between +3.51 and \n+5.08\u2030. The olivine values are lower than those typically observed for MORB [33], ocean \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    9  \nislands [36,37], arc volcanics [38] and mantle peridotites [39]. Results are similar to or lower \nthan values reported for the Reykjanes Peninsula and Theistareykir [20,40,41].  \n5. Discussion \nThe new results identify marked He and O isotopic heterogeneity in the magmas erupted in \nthe centre of Iceland. In the following sections, we examine the origin of these isotopic \nvariations in terms of crustal and mantle contributions, and discuss their implications for the \nevolution of the Icelandic mantle. \n5.1 Crustal control on 18O\/16O in central Icelandic magmas \nCrustal contamination has been shown to modify \u03b418O values in several previous studies of \nIcelandic magmatism [20,40,41-43]. The way in which \u03b418O values of basaltic melt change \nduring interaction with hydrothermally altered, Icelandic crust can be modelled in two ways. \nFirst, assimilation of older lavas in the crust may occur during fractional crystallisation \n(AFC). Alternatively, basaltic magmatism could introduce sufficient heat to generate rhyolitic \ncrustal melts that could then mix with the invading basalt. In reality, there is likely to be a \nspectrum of processes operating, but these endmember scenarios provide a context for \ndiscussing the origin of \u03b418O variation in the central Icelandic magmas. Crustal \ncontamination models are also sensitive to the \u03b418O value chosen for the contaminant. This is \na contentious issue as there is substantially oxygen isotopic heterogeneity recorded in \nsamples of Icelandic crust [44,45]. Such heterogeneity may be homogenised during crustal \nmelting, so \u03b418O values of natural rhyolites provide a useful estimate of a generic crustal \nendmember that might be encountered by batches of basalt erupted in different parts of \nIceland. Therefore, we follow [40] in selecting a \u03b418O value of 0\u2030 for the crust, as this value \nis slightly more negative than the lowest values measured in rhyolites from Krafla and Askja \n[42,46]. This estimate is lower than other estimates of \u03b418O in Icelandic crust (+2\u2030 [20,45]) \nwhich means that our modelling allows greater isotopic leverage for changing melt \u03b418O \nvalues. \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    10  \nContamination of a primitive, incompatible trace element-depleted magma (e.g. similar to \nTh-29) by rhyolite can reproduce the trace element and oxygen isotope characteristics of the \ncentral Iceland glasses with 8% to 13% contamination for Group 1, ~ 20% contamination for \nGroup 2 and ~20% to ~35% contamination for Group 3 (curve A, Fig. 5). However, the \nelevation of SiO2 and lowering of FeO that would result from addition of these volumes of \nrhyolitic magma [20,40] are not observed in the central Iceland lavas. The increase in FeO \nfrom Group 1, through Group 2 to Group 3 and the limited range in SiO2 preclude basalt \u2013 \nrhyolite mixing as a mechanism for generating low \u03b418O values in the central Iceland rocks.  \nAn AFC model in which depleted basaltic magma assimilates \u201cmedian\u201d crustal andesite [40] \ncan produce a close match to the Group 1 glasses for trace element enrichment and \u03b418O \n(curve B, Fig 5). Limited amounts of AFC are consistent with the mafic character of all of the \ndepleted rocks. A similar conclusion has been reached for depleted lavas from Theistareykir \nin the NRZ [40]. Although the importance of AFC at Theistareykir has been disputed [47], \nthe oxygen isotope data for Group 1 support the conclusions that depleted lavas have \ninteracted with the crust and that depleted Icelandic mantle possesses \u03b418O which is within \nthe range of the source of MORB [40]. However, more extensive differentiation of depleted \nmagma by AFC cannot lower \u03b418O and enrich trace elements to the extent observed in Group \n2 and 3 glasses (curve B, Fig. 5). Trace element ratios may themselves be fractionated during \nmelt \u2013 crust interaction. For example, the trace element concentrations and ratios (e.g. \nLa\/Sm) of Krafla rhyolites are significantly different from those of the Krafla basalts from \nwhich they are derived [48]. However, such fractionation will also affect the major element \ncomposition of the contaminant. The contaminant required to elevate La\/Sm sufficiently from \na primitive depleted lava through Group 1 to groups 2 and 3 by AFC would possess the trace \nelement composition of a rhyolite (c.f. [20]). The simplest explanation for such a contaminant \nis that it is a rhyolitic melt but, as discussed above, the major element composition of Group \n2 and 3 are inconsistent with addition of a rhyolitic component (curve A, Fig. 5). \nA better fit to the Group 2 and 3 data can be achieved for a model in which the invading \nbasalt, with \u03b418O resembling Group 1, and the crustal contaminant are both enriched in \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    11  \nincompatible trace elements (curve C, Fig. 5). Between 50% to 75% differentiation by AFC \ncan sufficiently lower \u03b418O and enrich trace elements. While this model does fit the data, it \nrequires that Group 2 melts, erupted at three distinct locations, all experienced very similar \namounts of contamination. An alternative interpretation is that the Group 2 lavas retain their \nprimary oxygen isotopic and trace element compositions. In this scenario, Group 3 develops \nfrom primary Group 2 melts through more restricted amounts of AFC (curve D, Fig. 5). In \nfact, the extents of differentiation required for Group 3 in this model are very similar to those \nmodelled for Group 1 (Fig. 5) and for incompatible trace element-depleted lavas from \nTheistareykir [40]. \nIrrespective of whether Group 2 rocks retain their primary oxygen isotopic characteristics or \nhave interacted with the crust, the modelling requires that the initial melts were enriched in \nincompatible trace elements. Furthermore, since differentiation and hydrothermal alteration \nby meteoric water will have a negligible influence on radiogenic isotope ratios either model \ncan be reconciled with the Sr and Nd isotopic data (Fig. 3). However, the important \ndistinction arises in the implications for \u03b418O values in the mantle. If Group 2 lavas have \nretained their primary \u03b418O then all group 2 and 3 melts are derived from low-\u03b418O mantle. If, \ninstead, Group 2 have experienced crustal contamination then both groups could be derived \nfrom mantle with \u03b418O values similar to the rest of upper mantle. This issue can be examined \nfurther by using helium data. \n5.2 Helium - oxygen isotope relationships and early (pre-eruptive) degassing \nHelium concentrations lie at the lower end of the range observed in MORB [1,49], probably \nas a result of melt degassing prior to eruption. He loss renders residual He in melts more \nsusceptible to recording contamination [14,32,49]. Since Icelandic crust is a significant \nreservoir of radiogenic helium [42] it is important to constrain the effect that \ndegassing\/contamination may have had on the primary 3He\/4He of melts before determining \nthe origin of 3He\/4He variation in the mantle. Figure 6 compares 3He\/4He and \u03b418O for the \nnew dataset. The curvature of binary mixing trajectories between end-members i and j can be \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    12  \ndescribed by the parameter k (where k = ([He]\/[O]i)\/([He]\/[O]j)). The abundance of \nradiogenic He in Icelandic crust depends upon parent element concentration, age of the crust \nand retention of the He produced. Condomines et al. [42] show that one-million-year-old \naltered basalt with U = 0.3ppm and Th\/U ~3.5, which retains 100% of in-grown He, will \ncontain ~6.5 \u00d7 10-8 cm3STP\/g of 4He. This value can be reduced or increased proportionally \nif the crustal component is assumed to be younger or older, respectively. \nThe range of \u03b418O and 3He\/4He in Group 3 glasses can be modelled by interaction between \nGroup 2 and hydrothermally altered crust. For Icelandic crust with \u03b418O of 0\u2030 and 3He\/4He \nof 0.05RA, a good fit to the Group 3 data is obtained for contamination of a melt containing \n~0.22 \u00d7 10-8 cm3STP\/g He (k \u2245 30), which is only a factor of three lower than the lowest [He] \nin any Group 2 glasses (grey, dashed curve, Fig. 6). The amounts of contamination required \nare similar to those predicted from \u03b418O values and trace element ratios. This indicates that \nmoderately to extensively degassed magma is susceptible to contamination despite the \nrelatively young age of the Icelandic crust [42]. The lack of 3He\/4He variation in Group 2 is \nmore difficult to reconcile with contamination of high-3He\/4He melts by radiogenic (crustal) \nhelium. Group 2 glasses display near constant 3He\/4He over a wide range of [He] (Fig. 4): a \nfeature that is typical of magma degassing without modification by crustal helium [49,50]. \nSuites of melts that have interacted with crust tend to display wide variations in 3He\/4He at \nrelatively low [He], as is observed in Group 3 (Fig. 4). To generate the recurring 3He\/4He \nsignature of Group 2 through melt \u2013 crust interaction would require a coincidence of different \nextents of He contamination for at least three different eruption sites, all producing mixtures \nwith indistinguishable 3He\/4He. While we cannot rule out this possibility entirely, we \nconsider it substantially less likely than the alternative hypothesis that Group 2 glasses \nrepresent a previously unrecognised source beneath central Iceland with MORB-like 3He\/4He \n(~ 8RA) and \u03b418O that is lower than the source of MORB (Section 5.1). \nFor high-3He\/4He magmas we initially assume that a primitive (P) end member samples a \nless-degassed mantle source, characterised by higher 3He\/4He and [He] than crust. Crustal \ncontamination of melts from P should produce convex upwards trajectories to the left of k=1 \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    13  \n(Fig. 6); however, all Icelandic glasses (this work and published values) plot with k-values \ngenerally between 5 and 50 (i.e. to the right of k=1) implying that [3He]C >> [3He]P. It is \nhighly improbable that Iceland\u2019s degassed, basaltic crust will contain more He than primitive \nmantle melts, which in turn suggests that \u2013 as with the model for Group 3 glasses - degassing \nwas able to exert a strong influence on the susceptibility of high-3He\/4He melts to crustal \ncontamination. For k-values between 5 and 50 (Fig. 6) the He content of the contaminated \nmelt (P endmember) would fall between 1.36 and 13.6 (\u00d7 10-9 cm3STP\/g) and, due to the \nincompatibility of He, the source concentration would be even lower. However, all estimates \nfor mantle [He] are considerably higher than this range. For example, MORB mantle is \nestimated to contain ~1.5 \u00d7 10-5 cm3STP\/g [4He] based on measurements of \u2018popping-rock\u2019 \nfrom the Mid-Atlantic Ridge [51]. Theoretical estimates of [He] in primitive mantle are even \nhigher: Porcelli and Wasserburg [51] calculated a value of ~6.5\u00d710-4 cm3STP\/g based upon a \nsteady-state upper mantle fluxed by 3He from a lower mantle reservoir with ~30RA, whereas \nHilton et al. [50] concluded that primitive mantle should contain up to approximately one \nhundred times more He than MORB-mantle. To explain the He-O isotope relationships (Fig. \n6), we conclude that high-3He\/4He melts must have undergone extensive magmatic degassing \n(leading to a reduction in [He] down to 10-4 times the initial content) prior to the \ncontamination that introduced radiogenic He and lowered \u03b418O. We speculate that the \nenhanced degassing of depleted lavas may be due to higher concentration of intrinsic (source-\nderived) or extrinsic (crust-derived) water. Icelandic glasses are relatively H2O-rich [52] and \nwater is known to lower the solubility of CO2 in basaltic melt [53]. CO2 is the carrier phase \nfor volatile He and so for any confining pressure (e.g. depth to a magma chamber) a water-\nrich melt will have lost a greater fraction of its intrinsic helium and is, therefore, more likely \nto record addition of extraneous (crustal) He [49,54]. \n5.3 Helium isotope variations in Central Iceland \nGroup 3 glasses have interacted with Icelandic crust so their 3He\/4He are not representative of \ntheir sources. The helium isotopic characteristics of nearly all other central Iceland rocks fall \ninto two categories: (a) MORB-like values found in trace element-enriched lavas located \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    14  \nimmediately north of Vatnaj\u00f6kull, and (b) high-3He\/4He values in trace-element depleted \nrocks found at greater distance from the proposed plume centre. In this respect, the central \nIceland data resemble those of Baffin Island which Stuart et al. [27] explained as a result of \nbinary mixing between two mantle components. The first is depleted North Atlantic mantle \ninfiltrated by high-3He\/4He material and the second is high-87Sr\/86Sr, low 143Nd\/144Nd \ndomains in the asthenospheric mantle with 3He\/4He ~ 8RA. A similar mixing model can be \napplied to central Iceland with the lower (MORB-like) 3He\/4He mantle concentrated close to \nVatnaj\u00f6kull and surrounded by 3He-recharged, depleted mantle (Fig. 1). However, an \nimportant difference is that the incompatible trace element-enriched samples from central \nIceland have higher 143Nd\/144Nd than predicted for the Baffin Island enriched component at \n3He\/4He of ~8RA (~0.51280 [27]; c.f. Fig. 3). This observation suggests that there are \ndifferences between the enriched components supplying these two sample suites.  \nBreddam et al. [9] mapped a \u201cplateau\u201d of high 3He\/4He ratios coinciding with the regional \ngravity and seismic anomalies over central Iceland. These, respective, chemical and physical \nanomalies were interpreted to represent the focus of mantle upwelling in the region. With our \nmore extensive 3He\/4He data set, we are able to recognize additional complexity in the \ndistribution of magma sources in central Iceland. We note the existence of a source located \nnorth of Vatnaj\u00f6kull with MORB-like values surrounded by a high-3He\/4He source. The close \njuxtaposition of mantle sources with (i) 3He\/4He ~ 8RA and, (ii) 3He\/4He > 8RA has also been \ninferred for other OIB localities - such as Heard Island [32] and Hawaii [54]. Big Ben lavas \non Heard Island have MORB-like 3He\/4He values whereas rocks from the Laurens Peninsula, \nlocated ~25 km distant, have 3He\/4He up to 18RA. In the case of Loihi Seamount (~ 30RA), \nsome nearby edifices have produced magmas with MORB-like 3He\/4He e.g. Mauna Kea and \nMauna Loa. Kurz et al. [54] attributed this latter observation to radial zonation of 3He\/4He in \nthe Hawaiian mantle. The situation appears to be more complex in central Iceland, however, \nwith a core of MORB-like 3He\/4He values confined mainly to the area immediately north of \nVatnaj\u00f6kull that contains high-3He\/4He domains at Vadalda and at Kambsfell (Fig. 1). The \nMORB-like 3He\/4He source is mainly associated with incompatible trace element-enriched \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    15  \nlavas, but at Eggert and Herdubreid trace element depleted rocks have 3He\/4He ~ 8RA. These \nobservations suggest that high-3He\/4He material can be introduced to enriched or depleted \nmantle but in the source of Iceland is more likely to interact with the latter. It is noteworthy \nthat Miocene lavas from Selardalur in NW Iceland, which have the highest 3He\/4He of any \nIcelandic location [23], also possess Sr and Nd isotope ratios similar to Vadalda (Fig. 3). \nBreddam et al. [9] also interpreted a steady decrease in 3He\/4He along the NRZ to MORB-\nlike values at Theistareykir as reflecting a changing melting regime associated with dispersal \nof plume material away from the conduit. However, their dataset contained relatively little \ndata for central Iceland and they reported relatively low 3He\/4He values of 8 to 9RA for \nTheistareykir. Our new Theistareykir data indicate that 3He\/4He beneath northernmost \nIceland is \u2265 12RA. Therefore, we suggest that changes in 3He\/4He along the strike of the NRZ \nmay reflect (i) a less extreme 3He\/4He gradient then envisaged by [9], or (ii) variable \ninteraction between high-3He\/4He magmas and the crust. Either scenario is consistent with \n3He\/4He ratios \u2265 11RA found offshore to the north of Iceland [55]. \nFinally, we note that although Vadalda has the highest reported 3He\/4He ratio (34.3RA) from \nIceland\u2019s neovolcanic zones, there are two reasons to suggest that its 3He\/4He ratio may not \nrepresent the pure high 3He\/4He mantle endmember composition in Icelandic magmatism. \nFirst, it falls short of the ratio predicted (~55RA) from extrapolation of linear He-Pb mixing \nrelationships observed for the Reykjanes Ridge [50] to a 206Pb\/204Pb ratio of 19.35. This \nprediction assumes that (i) central Iceland lies at the core of the present-day Icelandic plume \nand is characterised by a distinctive enriched source component with 206Pb\/204Pb of 19.35 \n(IE1 of [5]), and (ii) that the Reykjanes Ridge suite also contains a contribution from this \ncomponent diluted by one or more depleted sources that possess lower 206Pb\/204Pb and \n3He\/4He ratios. Second, if proto-Iceland plume at Baffin Island (~61Ma) is characterised by a \n3He\/4He ratio of 49.5RA [27] \u2013 itself a minimum estimate - then, for an assumed primitive \nmantle 3He content of 7.6 \u00d7 1010 atoms\/g [12], closed-system addition of radiogenic He (Bulk \nEarth U =21ppb and Th\/U = 3.8) should produce a present-day Iceland plume 3He\/4He value \nof ~ 48RA \u2013 considerably higher than the observed value at Vadalda. \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    16  \n5.4 Oxygen isotope heterogeneity of Icelandic mantle \nOxygen isotopic characteristics in central Iceland lavas are different in incompatible trace \nelement enriched and depleted samples. The highest \u03b418O values of incompatible trace \nelement-depleted rocks overlap with the ranges for oceanic lavas from various tectonic \nsettings, and some lowering of oxygen isotope ratios can be shown to result from interaction \nwith low-\u03b418O Icelandic crust (Section 5.1). However, incompatible trace-element enriched \nglasses have lower oxygen isotope ratios that require the presence of a low-\u03b418O source. \nMacpherson et al. [11] discussed two possible origins for 18O-poor material in the mantle. \nThe first suggestion - a contribution from 18O-depleted outer core alloy - is highly unlikely in \nthe present case. If the outer core does have low \u03b418O, it will be lower than the mantle by \nonly a few tenths of a per mille [11] and unable to produce the relatively large \u03b418O \ndifference required of the enriched source in central Iceland. The alternative possibility is \nrecycling of oceanic crust that was hydrothermally altered (>250\u00b0C) prior to subduction. \nRecycled crustal components have recently been advocated to explain Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic \nvariation throughout Iceland [5], and has previously been proposed to explain low magmatic \n\u03b418O in other hotpot localities at Hawaii and the Manus Basin [11,56]. Unfortunately, there is \ninsufficient oxygen isotopic variation in the present suite of glasses to construct meaningful \nmodels of this process (c.f. [5]), but simple mass balance calculations can be performed to \npredict the isotopic composition and quantity of recycled crust that must be added to typical \nupper mantle (\u03b418O = +5.5\u2030 [39]) to produce a source with \u03b418O of +4\u2030. Figure 7 \ndemonstrates that ~ 40% recycled crust with \u03b418O of +2\u2030, at the lower end of variation \nrecognised in ophiolites or ocean floor drill holes, is required to produce a mixture with \u03b418O \nof +4\u2030 [57,58]. A smaller contribution can be accommodated if the recycled crust possessed \nlower \u03b418O (Fig. 7). \n5.5 Implications for the He-paradox and statistical interpretation of 3He\/4He datasets \nLavas with 3He\/4He greater than MORB are often inferred to contain a large contribution \nfrom a reservoir that is richer in primordial volatiles than DMM. This reservoir could be the \nlower mantle [1 and references therein]. However, the observation that high 3He\/4He lavas \nfrom Loihi Seamount have lower [He] than MORB yields a \u201chelium paradox\u201d [59] between \nthe theory of a He-rich, high-3He\/4He source and the reality of He-poor, high-3He\/4He lavas. \nExplanations offered for this paradox include He degassing from ocean island magmas \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    17  \nbecause of low confining pressures [50], loss of a CO2-rich carrier phase at the base of the \nlithosphere beneath ocean islands [29], different gas-loss mechanism for MORB and OIB \n[60], or recharge of DMM by small volumes of primordial volatile-rich material [27]. The \nnew data indicate that helium concentrations in high-3He\/4He magmas from central Iceland \nhave been strongly influenced by degassing, which will lower [He] prior to addition of \ndistinctive crustal helium, which will lower 3He\/4He. As discussed above, we speculate that \nthis process may be exacerbated by higher water contents in Icelandic lavas. Helium \nconcentrations can be anticipated to have been lowered further during eruption. We suggest \nthat in central Iceland the features typical of the He-paradox result from extensive degassing \nof magma during their transport through the lithosphere. \n6. Summary \nHelium and oxygen isotope ratios of basalts from central Iceland show considerable \nvariation. Our samples that are derived from depleted mantle sources predominantly have \nhigh 3He\/4He but \u03b418O similar to the upper mantle. Enriched sources tend to produce primary \nmelts with MORB-like 3He\/4He (~ 8RA) and lower \u03b418O (~ 4\u2030). Much of the magmatism in \ncentral Iceland is prone to interaction with the crust, which acts to lower both helium and \noxygen isotope ratios. For helium, this modification is most apparent in rocks that contained \nlittle helium. Helium loss occurs primarily through degassing, which may be exacerbated by \nhigh water contents. As a general rule, 3He\/4He can be expected to show more variation in \nsuites of magmas that contain high water contents as a result of water-rich sources or \ninteraction with hydrated crust.  \nHigh 3He\/4He magmatism is concentrated to the north and, particularly, to the west of central \nIceland. The elevated 3He\/4He in these regions results from interaction between depleted \nmantle and a helium-rich, high-3He\/4He component (c.f. [27]). Despite the effects of the crust \nsome incompatible trace element-enriched lavas from immediately north of Vatnaj\u00f6kull \npreserve primary MORB-like 3He\/4He and low \u03b418O. The trace element enrichment and low \n\u03b418O values most probably reflect a source containing recycled, subducted oceanic crust. \nHigh 3He\/4He ratios are rare in this area, which is close to the proposed centre of the \nIcelandic plume. The predominantly MORB-like 3He\/4He ratios suggest that the mantle north \nof Vatnaj\u00f6kull has largely, but not exclusively, escaped the 3He-enrichment observed to the \nnorth and west. Since sources with enriched and depleted characteristics can both carry \n \nMacpherson et al.     Central Iceland 3He\/4He and \u03b418O    18  \nMORB-like 3He\/4He or higher 3He\/4He, the origin of high 3He\/4He in Icelandic mantle is \nindependent of the processes controlling the evolution of trace elements, and of radiogenic \nand stable isotope ratios. \nAcknowledgements \nField collection of samples was supported by the Nordic Volcanological Institute.

Oxygen isotope ratios are plotted either as glass \u03b418O values \nor, where olivine was analysed, as melt equivalent based on \u0394melt-ol of +0.4\u2030. Symbols are as \nin Fig. 2. The dashed line (curve A) represents mixing between a depleted lava with \u03b418O = \n+5.1\u2030 and La\/Sm = 0.67 [40] and rhyolitic magma. The rhyolite has \u03b418O of 0\u2030 (see text \nfor discussion) with La = 30ppm and La\/Sm = 3.3 (illustrative values based on estimates in \nthe literature [20,40,48]). Tick marks indicate percentage of rhyolite in mixture. Solid curves \nare models for fractional crystallisation with assimilation of hydrothermally altered crust with \nthe composition proposed by Eiler et al [40]. Curve B is for contamination of depleted lava \nfrom Theistareykir [40], curve C is for contamination of a Krafla basalt with La = 6.3 and \nLa\/Sm = 2.9 [64] and curve D is for contamination of a Group 2 glass (KVK-169). Tick \nmarks give the fraction of melt remaining. Data for melt compositions calculated from WRZ \nlavas (inverted triangles) and NRZ lavas (diamonds) are shown for comparison [9,20,40]. \n \nMacpherson et al.
