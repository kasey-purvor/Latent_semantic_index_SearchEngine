Introduction\nVolume-phase holographic (VPH) gratings poten-\ntially have many advantages over classical surface-\nrelief gratings.1,2 They are already in operation in\nsome existing astronomical spectrographs,3 and their\nuse is also planned for a number of forthcoming\ninstruments.4 Although the main applications of\nVPH gratings are currently for optical spectrographs,\nthey will also be useful for near-infrared (NIR) spec-\ntrographs if the performance at low temperatures is\nsatisfactory. In particular, the diffraction efficiency\nand its dependency on wavelength should be con-\nfirmed. Contraction of dichromated gelatin with de-\ncreasing temperature could cause variations in line\ndensity and the diffraction efficiency profile (the\nthickness of the gelatin layer is one of the parameters\nthat define diffraction efficiency). Since thermal cy-\ncling may cause some deterioration of a VPH grating\nand reduce its operational lifetime, we also need to\ninvestigate whether the characteristics vary with\nsuccessive thermal cycles. Previously we tested a\nVPH grating at 200 K and confirmed that the perfor-\nmance is nearly independent of temperature during\nfive thermal cycles.5,6 Although cooling to 200 K can\nbe sufficient for a spectrograph operating at wave-\nlengths to \u00021.8 \u0002m (H band) such as the Fiber Multi\nObject Spectrograph (FMOS),7 a much lower temper-\nature (e.g., 100 K) is required to extend the spectral\ncoverage of a spectrograph to \u00022.4 \u0002m (K band).\nIn this paper, measurements of the diffraction ef-\nficiency of VPH gratings at 100 K and at room tem-\nperature are reported. Pictures of the gratings\ninvestigated are shown in Fig. 1, both of which were\nmanufactured by Ralcon Development Laboratory.\nThe one in the left panel of Fig. 1 has a line density of\n385 lines\u0003mm and the peak of diffraction efficiency\nexists at approximately 1.3 \u0002m at the Bragg condi-\ntion when the incident angle of an input beam to the\nnormal of the grating surface is 15\u00b0. The measure-\nments of this grating are performed at wavelengths\nfrom 0.9 to 1.6 \u0002m. Since it is important to see\nwhether the performance at low temperatures is dif-\nferent from grating to grating,8\u201310 we also investigate\na different VPH grating, which is shown in the right\npanel of Fig. 1. (This grating was provided as a free\nsample for demonstration purposes only.) The line\ndensity is 300 lines\u0003mm and the peak efficiency is\nobtained at approximately 0.7 \u0002m for an incident an-\ngle of 6\u00b0. The measurements of this grating are per-\nformed at wavelengths from 0.5 to 0.9 \u0002m.\n2. Test Facility and Measurements\nIn Figs. 2 and 3 below, the overall configuration of the\noptical components used for the measurements is in-\ndicated (detailed information for the main compo-\nnents is given in Table 1). Light exiting from the\nmonochromator is fed into the cryogenic chamber\nthrough the fiber cable (Fig. 2). Lenses with the same\nspecifications are attached to both ends of this fiber\nThe authors are with the Centre for Advanced Instrumentation,\nDepartment of Physics, University of Durham, SouthRoad, Durham\nDH1 3LE, UK.

The spectral bandwidth of this input\nbeam is set by the slit width at the exit of the mono-\nchromator. The slit width and the corresponding\nspectral bandwidth are set to 0.5 mm and \u00020.01 \u0002m,\nrespectively, throughout the measurements. The in-\nput beam diameter is \u000225 mm, which is defined by\nthe lens diameter of the fiber cable assembly. The\nincident beam is then diffracted by the grating. The\nposition of the output collimator lens and the VPH\ngrating are rotated independently around the cen-\ntral axis of the cold bench so that the diffracted\nbeam, for a certain combination of incident angle\nand wavelength, goes through the window toward\nthe camera section consisting of lenses and a detec-\ntor (Fig. 3). The output fiber core is thus reimaged\non the detector.\nThe basic measurement procedures are as follows:\nFirst, the brightness of the lamp and the wavelength\nof light exiting from the monochromator are fixed (the\nbrightness of the lamp is kept constant by a stabilized\npower supply), and the total intensity included in the\nimage of the fiber core is measured without a VPH\ngrating. This measurement is performed at all the\nsampling wavelengths and is also carried out both at\nroom temperature and at cold temperature. The\nbrightness of the lamp can be changed when moving\nfrom one wavelength to another; a higher brightness\nis used at the shortest and longest wavelengths be-\nFig. 1.

These data are\nused to normalize the intensities measured when a\nVPH grating is inserted into the test setup and to\ncalculate the diffraction efficiency. Since marginal\ndifferences \u0004\u00022%\u0005 were found in the intensities mea-\nsured without a VPH grating between room temper-\nature and cold temperature, we use the intensities\ntaken at room (cold) temperature to normalize those\nmeasured with a VPH grating at room (cold) temper-\nature, respectively.\nNext a VPH grating is inserted and the intensity of\nthe first-order \u0004m \u0004 \u00051\u0005 diffracted light is measured\nfor an incident angle of 10\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 20\u00b0 at all the\nsampling wavelengths. Once all these measurements\nare performed, a cooling cycle of the VPH grating is\nstarted. The temperature of the grating is monitored\nwith a calibrated silicon diode sensor on the grating\nsurface, close to the edge of the grating but unillumi-\nnated by the input beam. For a good thermal contact\nbetween the grating and the sensor and accurate\nmeasurements of the grating temperature, we put a\nthin layer of grease to increase the contact area be-\ntween the two surfaces. We also use a device to keep\npushing the sensor lightly against the grating during\na thermal cycle, which is thermally insulated from\nthe metal components of the test facility. An example\nof the temperature variation is shown in Fig. 4. When\nthe temperature of the grating becomes lower than\n100 K, we start the same sequence of measurements\nas above while running the compressor and cold\nheads. There is no closed-loop control of the grating\ntemperature because the rate of temperature varia-\ntion is very low at 100 K. The temperature of the\ngrating, therefore, stays at \u000290\u2013100 K for the dura-\ntion of the measurements. After the measurements at\n\t100 K, the compressor and cold heads are switched\noff, and the VPH grating is allowed to warm up pas-\nsively. The measurements are repeated when the\ntemperature is back to the ambient temperature.\nDuring these thermal cycles, the cryogenic chamber\nis kept evacuated to \u000210\u00067 Torr.\n3. Results and Discussions\nFirst we show the results from the VPH grating for\nNIR wavelengths. In Fig. 5, the measured efficiency of\nthe first-order \u0004m \u0004 \u00051\u0005 diffraction is plotted against\nthe wavelength for an incident angle of 10\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and\n20\u00b0 in the left, middle, and right panels, respectively.\nThe dots indicate the data points at room temperature,\nand the triangles are those at 100 K. The error bars\nindicate estimated random errors in the measure-\nments expected due to the pixel-to-pixel variation of\nbackground intensities in the images of the fiber core\nand the subsequent uncertainty of background sub-\ntraction. Note that the large error at 0.9 \u0002m is due to\nthe lower sensitivity of the detector at the edge of the\nspectral coverage. For a clearer presentation, these\nerror bars are attached only to the data points for a\nFig. 3. (Color online) Schematic\nof the inside of the cryogenic\nchamber. To the right, the mech-\nanism to scan the incident beam\nangle to the VPH grating and the\nwavelength is described.\nFig. 4. Temperature variation of the VPH grating during a typ-\nical cooling cycle.\n10 August 2006 \u0003 Vol. 45, No. 23 \u0003 APPLIED OPTICS 5925\ncold test; those for a warm test are similar. These\nresults suggest that a VPH grating can withstand\ncryogenic temperatures in a vacuum and that its per-\nformance at 100 K is similar to that at room temper-\nature.\nTo see whether the performance of this VPH grat-\ning deteriorated with successive thermal cycling, the\ndifferences in diffraction efficiency for an incident\nangle of 15\u00b0 between the first warm test and subse-\nquent tests are averaged over the wavelength range\ninvestigated and plotted against the cycle number in\nFig. 6. Circles and triangles indicate the measure-\nments at room temperature and those at 100 K, re-\nspectively. The error bar represents a combination of\nthe standard deviation of the differences around the\naverage value and the typical uncertainty \u0004\u00023%\u0005 in\nthe measurement of diffraction efficiency. Similar re-\nsults are obtained from the data for the other incident\nangles (10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0). This result suggests that no\nsignificant deterioration of a VPH grating is caused\nby thermal cycling.\nNext we present results from the VPH grating for\nvisible wavelengths. The measurement procedure is\nthe same as that in the NIR except that a CCD cam-\nera is used, and the grating is accommodated with a\ndifferent mount on the cold bench. In Fig. 7, the mea-\nsurements of diffraction efficiency at 100 K are com-\npared with those at room temperature for an incident\nangle of 1\u00b0, 6\u00b0, and 11\u00b0 in the left, middle, and right\npanels, respectively. In Fig. 8, the average difference\nfrom the first warm test is plotted against cycle num-\nber for an incident angle of 6\u00b0. These results again\nsuggest that the performance does not largely depend\non the temperature or the number of thermal cycles.\nWe note that the throughput is significantly lower\nthan the NIR grating. The reason for this is un-\nknown, but this grating was for demonstration pur-\nposes only, and hence the low throughput may be due\nto, e.g., severe internal absorption and\u0003or imperfect\nfringes.\nThis robustness of the diffraction efficiency to the\ntemperature variation is expected for these VPH\ngratings in theory, provided that the linear thermal\nexpansion coefficient of gelatin at 100\u2013200 K is sim-\nilar to that at 200\u2013300 K, i.e., in the range of 10\u00064 to\n10\u00065 K\u00061. Given a linear thermal expansion coeffi-\ncient of 10\u00064 K\u00061, a gelatin thickness would be 2%\nsmaller at 100 K compared to that at 300 K. Consid-\nering the VPH grating for NIR wavelengths and as-\nsuming a 12 \u0002m thickness at room temperature,\nwhich gives a good fit of the predicted throughput\ncurve to the measurements for this NIR VPH grat-\ning,5 the thickness at 100 K would be 11.76 \u0002m. Also,\nthe line density would be increased by the same\nfraction. Since the line density of this grating is\n385 lines\u0003mm in the specification, it would be\n393 lines\u0003mm at 100 K. In Fig. 9, the diffraction ef-\nficiency predicted with coupled-wave analysis11 is\nplotted against the wavelength for the two sets of line\ndensity and gelatin thickness; one is 385 lines\u0003mm\nand 12 \u0002m, and the other is 393 lines\u0003mm and\n11.76 \u0002m. The fringe amplitude in the refractive in-\ndex is assumed to be 0.055 in both calculations. An\nincident angle of 15\u00b0 is also assumed, but the differ-\nFig. 6. The differences in diffraction efficiency of the NIR VPH\ngrating at one test from the first warm test are averaged over the\nwavelength range investigated and plotted against the cycle num-\nber. Open triangles and solid dots represent the data at 100 K and\nthose at room temperature, respectively. The error bars indicate a\ncombination of the standard deviation of a distribution of the dif-\nferences around the average value and the typical uncertainty in\nthe measurement of diffraction efficiency.\nFig. 5. Diffraction efficiency of the NIR VPH grating measured for an incident angle of 10\u00b0 (left), 15\u00b0 (center), and 20\u00b0 (right). These plots\nshow the measurements of the first-order \u0004m \u0004 \u00051\u0005 diffraction.\n5926 APPLIED OPTICS \u0003 Vol. 45, No. 23 \u0003 10 August 2006\nence between the two calculations is similarly small\nfor incident angles of 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. Note that the pre-\ndicted diffraction efficiencies are scaled by a factor of\n1.2 to fit them to the measurements, indicating that\nthe throughput is \u000220% lower than the theoretical\nprediction. About half of this discrepancy can be ex-\nplained by energy loss due to reflections at interfaces\nbetween the glass substrate and the ambient space.\nThe other half has not been identified, but perhaps it\nincludes internal absorption (identifying the source of\nthis energy loss is beyond the scope of this paper).\nThese calculations suggest that the expected change\nin throughput is as small as confirmed by the mea-\nsurements.\n4. Summary and Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have presented results from cryo-\ngenic tests of VPH gratings at \u0002100 K. The aims of\nthese tests were to see whether the diffraction effi-\nciency at a low temperature as a function of wave-\nlength is significantly different from that at room\ntemperature and to see whether the grating can with-\nstand a number of thermal cycles. Having exposed\nVPH gratings to ten cycles between room tempera-\nture and 100 K, we found that the diffraction effi-\nciency measured at 100 K agrees with that at room\ntemperature within the errors. We also found no clear\nevidence that the performance changes with the suc-\ncessive thermal cycles. These results were found for\nboth of the two different VPH gratings investigated\nhere, which may imply that VPH gratings can with-\nstand such cryogenic temperatures in general. Ide-\nally, an investigation of more gratings, in particular,\nfrom different manufacturers and with different sub-\nstrate materials, should be carried out to confirm this\npoint.\nIt needs to be emphasized that we have only con-\nfirmed the performance of a low-dispersion VPH grat-\ning at cryogenic temperatures. It would be useful to\nrepeat the same experiments for high-dispersion\nVPH gratings. Since the bandwidth of a throughput\ncurve is narrower for high-dispersion gratings, some\nchanges of physical properties (e.g., gelatin thick-\nness) due to temperature variations are expected to\nbe revealed much more clearly in the form of a shift\nof the throughput peak and\u0003or a global decrease of\nFig. 7. Same as Fig. 5 but for the VPH grating for visible wavelengths. The measured diffraction efficiency for incident angles of 1\u00b0, 6\u00b0,\nand 11\u00b0 is plotted against the wavelength.\nFig. 8. Same as Fig. 6 but for the VPH grating for visible wave-\nlengths.\nFig. 9. Diffraction efficiency of the NIR VPH grating for an inci-\ndent angle of 15\u00b0 is plotted as a function of the wavelength. The\nblack solid curve indicates the diffraction efficiency calculated with\nthe coupled-wave analysis for a line density of 385 lines\u0003mm and\na gelatin thickness of 12.00 \u0002m. The dashed curve indicates the\ndiffraction efficiency computed for a line density of 393 lines\u0003mm\nand a gelatin thickness of 11.76 \u0002m, representing that expected at\n100 K. In both calculations, a fringe amplitude of 0.055 is assumed.\nThese model predictions are compared with the actual measure-\nments shown in the middle panel of Fig. 5, which are plotted with\nsolid dots and open triangles.\n10 August 2006 \u0003 Vol. 45, No. 23 \u0003 APPLIED OPTICS 5927\nthe throughput.
