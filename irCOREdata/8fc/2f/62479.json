Minerals \nsuch as zircon can newly grow during amphibolite facies or granulite facies events, \nproviding direct ages of metamorphism.  Pre-existing minerals like monazite, allanite, \nand titanite can preserve a component of their original age in spite of upper \namphibolite facies re-working and very thorough recrystallisation of the rock fabric \nduring mylonite development.  The degree of incomplete Pb loss can be used to \ndeduce, at least semi-quantitatively, the temperature and duration of the subsequent \nevent.  In well-studied examples, the relative retentivity of Pb is highly predictable, \nand this helps place strong constraints on relative closure temperatures, even when \nlaboratory experimental data are lacking or inconclusive.  A number of examples are \npresented from a wide variety of geological environments to illustrate the response of \nU-Pb isotope systematics within accessory minerals superimposed deformation, \nmetamorphism and\/or mineral growth.   \n2 \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe response of mineral isotope systematics to metamorphism and deformation refers \nto how pre-existing minerals are affected by new environmental conditions, and to \nhow this response can be used to infer quantitative aspects such as temperature, \ntiming and duration of a subsequent event.  This paper reviews this topic as it pertains \nto the reactivation and reworking of older terrains within orogenic belts.   \n \nAlthough various isotopic systems have been applied to the cooling history and dating \nof rocks, this paper emphasizes the U-Pb scheme with accessory minerals because of \ntheir widespread application to Precambrian rocks.  U-Pb geochronology has \ndeveloped in the past 20 years into one of the most important geological tools and has \nrevolutionized the interpretation of Precambrian orogens and their temporal evolution. \nOne of the most important legacies of U-Pb dating using both conventional isotope \ndilution thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) and secondary ionisation mass \nspectrometry (SIMS, especially SHRIMP; Compston et al. 1984; Stern 1999) has \nbeen the extraction of primary crystallisation ages of igneous protoliths from \ncomplexly deformed and metamorphosed lithologies.  The importance of this \ngeological information is plain to see.  For example, these type of studies have \nrevealed the age of the world\u2019s oldest rocks in the Acasta gneisses of the western \nSlave Province (Bowring & Williams 1999) that would otherwise have been \nindeterminate with any degree of precision.  The ability of zircon to withstand the \nbattering of multiple high grade metamorphic events and retain the signature of its \noriginal crystallisation is well known.  This is perhaps its most valuable aspect to \nearth scientists. \n \nBy contrast, the application of  U-Pb dating using minerals other than zircon was \nslower to enter the mainstream.  These alternative minerals can reveal the thermal and \ndeformational history of complex orogenic belts.  Minerals that either recrystallize or \nlose some or all of their radiogenic Pb during metamorphic-deformational events are \n3 \nthe most important minerals to be employed in reconstructing the chronology of the \nthermal-metamorphic history. \n \nThe relevance of the U-Pb system in relation to other dating systems (i.e. K-Ar, Rb-\nSr) lies in three important facts.  First, the accessory minerals datable by the U-Pb \nmethod have quite variable Pb retentivities, allowing them to be used over a wide \nrange of conditions. Second, many of these minerals have significant enrichment of \nuranium coupled with little or no incorporation of initial lead, leading to a more \nrobust interpretation, and the dating can be undertaken with one mineral using single \ngrain or intra-grain analysis.  Third, the coupled decay scheme of two uranium parent \nisotopes decaying to two different radiogenic lead isotopes potentially allows no loss \nof precision across the entire spectrum of geological time with about one million year \nresolution.  A drawback however, is the difficulty in relating the growth of accessory \nminerals to the development of specific textures or mineral reactions with P-T \nsignificance. \n \nMany of the accessory minerals used in U-Pb geochronology, such as zircon, titanite, \nmonazite, xenotime, rutile, apatite, and allanite are involved in metamorphic reactions \nwith other minerals including garnet, clinopyroxene, amphibole, plagioclase, etc.  \nAlthough the pressure-temperature-fluid conditions of such reactions are at present \nvery poorly understood, there is great potential to coordinate the isotopic and P-T data \ninto a robust P-T-time path which could improve significantly the interpretation of \ncalculated ages.  This in turn would quantifiably improve knowledge of the response \nof pre-existing datable minerals to subsequent tectonic events. \n \nThis paper will introduce the main elements that govern how these mineral \nchronometers respond to subsequent events, present several illustrative examples, and \ndiscuss the metamorphic petrology of accessory minerals that have undergone \nrecrystallisation during reworking, relating dating to mineral-forming reactions.  \n \n4 \nProcesses affecting the isotopic response in mineral \nchronometers \nMineral cooling and closure temperature \nThe literature on the theoretical, experimental, and empirical aspects of closure \ntemperature in minerals is well-developed, having its origins in the work of \nArmstrong (1966).  In that study of orogenic belts, widespread re-setting of K-Ar ages \nby subsequent re-heating and metamorphism was clearly documented.  The theory of \nradiogenic isotope retention in cooling rocks was elegantly quantified by Dodson \n(1973), whose name is synonymous with closure temperature. This concept is now \nwidely applied to reveal aspects of the thermal history of cooling orogens. Provided \nthat minerals cooled from temperatures where there was no retention of radiogenic \ndaughter isotope to temperatures where complete retention prevailed, the approach is \ngenerally valid. Taking advantage of the variable closure temperatures of a variety of \nminerals using several analytical methods, it is possible to determine the cooling \nhistory of a terrain over more than 600oC.  Figure 1 is an example from British \nColumbia of a relatively complete thermal history using this approach (Spear & \nParrish 1996), using dating schemes discussed further in this paper. \n \nRelative retentivities of radiogenic daughter isotopes in minerals \nMany studies, both experimental and empirical, have helped to elucidate the \napproximate closure temperatures of minerals used in thermochronology.  Table 1 \nsummarizes this body of knowledge.  The closure temperature of some minerals is \nentirely within the brittle field of deformation (i.e. fission track dates in apatite), \nwhereas that of other minerals are within middle to upper amphibolite facies \nconditions where metamorphic recrystallisation leading to ductile flow is common \n(i.e. titanite U-Pb).  The value and relevance of mineral chronometers to revealing \nconditions of orogenic reworking is therefore quite variable. \nThe isotopic response of minerals to heating \nIn reworked terrains, incomplete loss of radiogenic isotopes (i.e. partial re-setting) \nduring a heating event is common, and in these circumstances, the theory is less well \n5 \ndeveloped with few well-studied examples.  Examples are the presence of complex \nargon release spectra in hornblende, mica or feldspar (McDougall & Harrison 1988), \ncomplex Rb-Sr mineral isochrons, discordance in U-Pb dates, and inherited \nxenocrystic zircon in anatectic magma. \n \nIn an influential early study by Hart (1964), the pattern of age re-setting in \nPrecambrian gneisses in Colorado as a function of distance from the Tertiary Eldora \nstock  was well documented.  Hornblende K-Ar dates were fully reset only within a \nfew metres of the contact whereas biotite K-Ar dates reflected the age of intrusion up \nto 100m away from granite-gneiss boundary.  This study was one of the first to \nestablish the relative retentivities of radiogenic Sr and Ar in minerals.  From this type \nof study it is possible to calculate the fractional loss of radiogenic daughter isotope \nthat occurred during heating.  Using equations of diffusion (i.e. Carslaw & Jaeger \n1959), mineral diffusivities, duration of heating and effective grain size, the maximum \ntemperature of heating can be deduced, in theory.  Alternatively, if the temperature \nwas well-constrained, the maximum duration of a heating event could be determined, \nwhich in turn could have important tectonic consequences. \n \nAn integrated example of basement reheating.   \n \nIn a study from the southeastern Canadian Cordillera, Crowley (1999), Crowley and \nParrish (1999), and Parrish (1995) studied the response of mineral chronometers in ca. \n1.9-2.1 Ga protolith gneisses to re-heating during a 50-60 Ma event involving intra-\ncrustal thrusting.  In this area high grade (sillimanite-K feldspar- anatexis) hanging \nwall terrain (the Selkirk Allochthon) was emplaced within a thick ductile shear zone \n(the Monashee decollement), onto the footwall consisting of  Precambrian \ngranitic\/gneissic rocks (the Monashee Complex).  The heating of the footwall was \nvariable, with deformational and metamorphic effects decreasing downwards.  \nSignificant reworking of the footwall is present within the shear zone up to 1.0 km \nbeneath the thrust, with widespread recrystallisation of quartz, feldspar, mica and \namphibole. Beneath the zone of re-working, Precambrian structures can be recognised \n(Figure 2). \n \n6 \n1.86 Ga titanite, monazite, and zircon are present within amphibolite and leucogranite \nof the footwall.  Zircon is the least well-behaved of the minerals in terms of U-Pb \nsystematics, due to a combination of Pb loss events.  However, the U-Pb systematics \nof titanite and monazite reveal a linear array of analyses connecting ca. 1.86 Ga with \nca. 50-60 Ma (summarized in figure 3 from a much larger data set).  There appears to \nbe a correlation between U-Pb discordance and proximity to the hanging wall, with \ndiscordance varying widely from 6% to 96%.  There is also limited evidence that \ndiscordance may partly be a function of grain size, but this is not simple because of \npartial recrystallisation.  Notwithstanding the complexities of recrystallisation \nmanifested by a coronitic zoning of apatite+thorite on original monazite, the \nmaximum fractional loss of radiogenic Pb from monazite and titanite from lower \nstructural levels during the 60 Ma event can be broadly estimated from these analyses \nto be less than 30% and 65%, respectively (Figure 3).  \n \nFor the sake of argument, if one accepts that diffusion coefficients for these minerals \ncan be estimated, even with inconsistent experimental values (Heaman & Parrish \n1991; Suzuki et al. 1994; Cherniak 1993; Smith & Giletti 1997), a family of \nmaximum temperature and heating duration combinations can produce the \ndocumented fractional loss, for the grain sizes of minerals that were analysed.  Using \nmaximum temperatures derived from petrological arguments (i.e. 600oC-700oC), the \nduration of heating can be deduced.  This analysis was done as part of the Parrish \n(1995) and Crowley and Parrish (1999) studies; these heating duration estimates were \nmuch shorter than intuitively expected, generally a maximum of 2 million years.  \nBecause the shear zone has displacement exceeding 100 km, relatively rapid rates of \nemplacement are implied.  Although this analysis has limitations due to uncertain \ninput parameters, it indicates the potential of the approach in providing a quantitative \nestimate of heating rates, that in turn provide constraints on the rates of movement \nand strain in shear zones.  This information was extracted mainly from mineral \nchronometers in the reworked older gneisses. By contrast, mineral dates on all \nhanging wall minerals other than zircon are Cretaceous or younger and these provide \nno particular insight into the conditions prevailing in the reworked footwall rocks. \nThis example establishes how the thermal history, including inferences about the \n7 \nduration of events, can be deduced by the response of minerals to orogenic re-heating \nduring reworking. \n \nArmouring of minerals: isotopic effects \nThe diffusion of radiogenic isotopes from  mineral to matrix occurs when the \nmineral\u2019s diffusivity is sufficiently high at a given temperature, provided the matrix \ncan incorporate the diffusing element. This process becomes limited when a mineral \nis enclosed within another mineral of limited diffusivity, for example when armoured \nby garnet. Recent papers by Zhu et al. (1997) and Zhu and O\u2019Nions (1999) \ndocumented monazite crystals within garnet, in high grade pelite of the late Archaean \nLewisian basement of northwest Scotland.  In these samples, monazite ages on \narmoured inclusions are generally older than those of the matrix, by up to 200 Ma or \nmore.  This example illustrates how a protracted metamorphic history may be \nextracted from a single thin section. The metamorphic reaction(s) that caused primary \ngrowth of metamorphic monazite, and the associated pressure-temperature-fluid \nenvironment, are however, less clear.  \nConsequences of metamorphism and recrystallisation to \nisotope systematics \n \nWhen older rocks are reworked by a subsequent event, there is an imposition of new \nenvironmental conditions.  These comprise different pressure and temperature, and \nthe introduction of a fluid phase into an otherwise relatively dry rock.  Variable strain \nis also imposed, a condition favouring neoblast growth and variable recrystallisation \nof pre-existing mineral phases.  The new environmental conditions can result in \nprograde metamorphism of the older rocks, for example heating mafic lithologies to \neclogite or granulite facies.  Also encountered in orogenic belts is the retrogressive \neffect of reworking of granitic rocks with a pre-existing high temperature igneous \nmineralogy.   Fabrics associated with the younger event are often penetrative and \ncharacterised by mineralogy consistent with the superimposed conditions.   \n8 \nPrograde reworking: eclogite and granulite development \nHigh pressure and high temperature metamorphism of reworked basement is a \ncommon feature of collisional orogens when subduction of continental crust occurs.  \nMetamorphic zircon is a common feature of certain lithologies, mainly mafic rocks, \nand it provides an excellent means to date the metamorphic event (Davidson & van \nBreemen 1988; Figure 4a, 5a,c).  \n \nThe Norwegian Caledonides contain a world class example of this type where \nfootwall gneisses of Mesoproterozoic age were overthrust by Caledonian nappes \nduring continental collision (Gee 1978).  A regional eclogite terrane was developed, \nmanifest by the preservation of eclogite in appropriate mafic lithologies, often \noccurring only as boudins (Wain 1997).  These older mafic rocks, of presumed pre-\nCaledonian amphibolite or lower metamorphic facies, were deformed into \ndiscontinuous sheets and boudins during shearing, with significant changes to \nmineralogy and texture.  In adjacent 1.6 Ga granitic gneisses, shear fabrics were \nsuperimposed but mineralogical evidence for high pressure metamorphism is less \nevident (Dewey et al. 1993).   \n \nIn a study of the titanite occurring in the 1.6 Ga protoliths of the Norwegian \nCaledonides, Tucker et al. (1987) showed that a younger generation of titanite was \npresent, in addition to older crystals, with core-rim zoning being observed.  The U-Pb \nsystematics of titanite from various samples preserved a striking linear array on the \nconcordia diagram connecting the original titanite age (1.66 Ga) with the 395 Ma age \nof the Caledonian metamorphic event.  Titanite U-Pb systematics indicate 6-100% \ndiscordance along this linear array.  Although it is not possible to fully differentiate \nthe effects of Pb loss and new growth on the isotope systematics, the age and \nrelatively short duration of the Caledonian event was accurately determined.  The \ntectonic events, including continental subduction, eclogite facies metamorphism, and \nrapid tectonic denudation and cooling, occurred rapidly (Krabbendam & Dewey, \n1998).  \n \nIn a study of variably retrogressed eclogite preserved in the Lewisian Glenelg inlier of \nnorthwest Scotland, Sanders et al. (1984) determined a 1.0-1.1 Ga Sm-Nd age of \n9 \ngarnet-clinopyroxene pairs, suggesting \u2018Grenvillian\u2019 eclogite development within host \ngneisses that were inferred to be >2.5 Ga.  Subsequent detailed study of one eclogite \n(T. S. Brewer  & others, unpublished data, 1999) revealed that metamorphic zircon \noccurred in these samples (Figure 4e), usually as round to irregular grains with very \nlow uranium contents of less than 10ppm.  The rare occurrence of these grains in thin \nsection suggests that they preferentially occur within zones of hydration and \nretrogression.  Rutile in equilibrium with the eclogite facies assemblage is partially \nreplaced by titanite (Figure 4b) produced during retrogression.  Titanite also occurs as \nmatrix grains.  An analysis of the U-Pb systematics of zircon, titanite and rutile \nreveals a complex picture of isotopic disequilibrium.  The titanite is similar in age, \nwithin error, to the metamorphic zircon at very close to 1.00 Ga. Rutile, on the other \nhand, is ca. 430 Ma.  The rutile age can be explained by its low Pb retentivity, with \nfinal closure of its Pb mobility in Caledonian time.   \n \nThese examples show that in reworked older rocks, zircon and titanite can provide \ninformation on the age of subsequent metamorphic events during both eclogite facies \nand later retrogression.  Careful study of the fabrics associated with these \nmineralogical changes may allow inferences about the absolute age of the fabric \ndevelopment to complement geological or regional arguments. \n \nRetrogression of granulites during reworking \nIn the Ungava peninsula, northern Quebec, the Late Archaean crust of the Superior \nProvince was over-ridden by the metasedimentary and metavolcanic allochthons of \nthe Cape Smith Belt (St-Onge et al. 1992).  The Archaean rocks beneath the basal \ndecollement preserve evidence of both granulite and amphibolite facies \nmetamorphism, whereas the allochthons are of greenschist to lower amphibolite \nfacies.  The zone of footwall deformation (Lucas & St-Onge 1992) is tens to hundreds \nof metres thick, and is associated with hydration and metamorphic retrogression. \nWithin granulites, titanite is absent, rutile being the stable Ti-bearing phase.  Within \nthe hornblende-bearing retrogressed zones, original orthopyroxene and rutile are rare \nto absent, and titanite is stable, in part overgrowing ilmenite.  The retrogressive \nreaction(s) were probably catalysed by the presence of water.  In a study of the \n10 \nisotopic response of these samples, Scott and St-Onge (1995) dated titanite from \nnumerous samples of retrogressed granulite within this zone.  The ages were nearly \nconcordant, ranging from 1814 to 1789 Ma, and these dates were interpreted to reflect \nthe age of titanite growth, fabric development, retrogression, and shear strain.  In this \ncase petrographic evidence of  new titanite growth is very clear.  A factor considered \nby the authors was the extent to which the titanite ages were cooling ages, since the \ntemperatures of retrogressive metamorphism (670oC) are similar to the titanite closure \ntemperature estimate (Table 1).  If the titanite dates were in fact cooling ages, then \nthey place only a minimum constraint on the ages of the retrogression and shearing.  \nThis situation illustrates an interpretation ambiguity that shall remain until better \ndiffusion information is obtained.  \n \nZircon within these rocks is virtually unaffected by the Proterozoic retrogression \nevent, and this can provide no useful information on its age.  Because of the relatively \nlow metamorphic grade, no pegmatite or other intrusive rocks are associated with the \nshearing, rendering the dating of the shear zone problematic.  Dates using the K-Ar \nand 40Ar-39Ar methods on hornblende and mica are less than 1750 Ma and they shed \nlittle light on the age of basement reworking.  Titanite growth, a product of mineral \nreactions during shearing and associated retrogression, provides instead the most \nimportant timing constraint of shear zone development. \n \nReworking of rocks under amphibolite facies conditions \nHornblende \u2013 biotite bearing granitic rocks are a common granitoid type in \ncontinental crust.  They are commonly involved in subsequent re-working events. If \nsubjected to middle to upper amphibolite facies conditions during shearing and \nrecrystallisation, the mineralogy is unlikely to change substantially, though there may \nbe penetrative fabric development. In the re-heating and recrystallisation of these \ntypes of rocks, Fe-Mg mica and hornblende will be completely reset, losing all \nradiogenic argon (and Sr) and will yield cooling ages if dated.  Accessory minerals \nsuch as allanite, titanite, zircon and apatite may be present, and for the most part will \nremain stable mineralogically during middle to upper amphibolite facies re-working. \nAlthough recrystallisation of these accessory minerals does occur and is sometimes \n11 \nvisible as core\/rim overgrowth relationships (Tucker et al. 1987), titanite and allanite \nappear to have greater internal strength than most rock forming minerals.  They often \nresist recrystallisation during penetrative fabric development, although a common \nfeature is a partial resorption of sharp edges and surfaces of euhedral phenocyrsts to \nproduce a rounded subhedral appearance, as illustrated by zircon in figures 5d and 5e .  \nSometimes, resorption can be extreme, producing highly irregular crystal shapes \n(Figure 5b).   \n \nIn a study of ultramylonites within the Brevard zone of the Appalachians, Wayne and \nSinha (1988, 1992) showed that zircon was little-affected by intense fracturing and by \nthe thorough recrystallisation and grain size reduction in the rock\u2019s matrix.  These \nstudies show that little information can be obtained on the nature of the subsequent \ndeformational event from zircon; instead, zircon clearly preserves the protolith age. \n \nThe survival of original igneous grains in spite of major recrystallisation can be \nproven by the U-Pb systematics in a study of the reworking of 100 Ma and 360 Ma \ngranodiorite protoliths during an upper amphibolite facies event ca. 60 Ma ago \n(Figure 6; Heaman & Parrish 1991; Spear & Parrish 1996). In that study, allanite was \nfound to be 75-90% discordant, but not fully reset.  Titanite from the same samples \nwas much more discordant, approximately 90-99%, but still not totally reset.  Aside \nfrom demonstrating survival of original grains, these data show clearly that allanite \nhas a stronger retention of Pb than titanite. These discordant arrays can be used to \ninfer both initial age of protolith (along with zircon), age of the subsequent event, and \nsemi-quantitative information on the temperature and duration of the later event.  \nThese minerals are thus a powerful bridge between the information obtained from U-\nPb zircon on the one hand, and K-Ar or Rb-Sr mica ages on the other. \n \nMetamorphic and isotopic effects during lower temperature reworking \n \nDuring lower amphibolite and greenschist facies metamorphic conditions, granitic \nlithologies usually contain a mineralogy substantially modified from the protolith. For \nexample, hornblende may react to form biotite, epidote, and\/or chlorite, and relatively \n12 \ncalcic plagioclase may become sausseritised with the formation of albite, epidote and \ncalcite.  With more leucocratic lithologies (mica-bearing granitoid rocks) affected by \nlower greenschist conditions, biotite reacts to form chlorite, or muscovite if \nmetasomatism is significant.  Because the lower temperature stability of hornblende \nvirtually coincides with its closure temperature (ca. 500oC), argon dating of \nhornblende will rarely, if ever, provide an unambiguous age of mineral growth, \nexcepting rapidly cooled and unaltered volcanic rocks. Argon dating of mica has the \nsame problem. \n \nUseful isotopic information on the age of crystal growth can be extracted from Rb-Sr \ndating of medium to coarse-grained muscovite.  In an insightful study, Piasecki and \nvan Breemen (1983) recognised correctly that Rb-Sr dating of large books of \nmuscovite, even when subjected to an amphibolite facies Caledonian event, preserved \nevidence of their crystallisation more than 700 Ma ago.  This can be explained by the \npositive correlation of grain size with closure temperature (Dodson 1973); very large \nmuscovite books several centimetres in diameter may retain their radiogenic Sr to \nupper amphibolite facies temperatures.  \n \nThe studies of Meffan-Main and Cliff (1997) and Freeman et al. (1997) in the Swiss \nAlps applied Rb-Sr dating to fabric-forming minerals in the re-worked Variscan \ngranitoid basement nappes of the central Alps.  They used microsampling techniques \nto date new mica, calcite, and feldspar that grew during the Alpine event.  This work \nhas allowed robust direct dating of Alpine deformation and has also provided an \nexplanation of why bulk dating of mica and feldspar from similar samples have \nambiguous ages that are difficult to interpret.  Isotopic disequilibrium amongst the \nmajor phases, including older feldspar megacrysts, is widespread in this greenschist \ngrade environment.    \n \nIn an application to the dating of shear zone fabrics, Parrish et al. (1988) studied \nporphryoblastic muscovite growing in a sheared biotite granite during lower \ngreenschist facies conditions.  In this sample, biotite disappeared from the protolith \nupon significant ductile shearing and recrystallisation at this low grade. \nMetasomatism accompanied by major fluid fluxing induced the growth of muscovite \n13 \nat the expense of biotite, with only minor formation of chlorite. Muscovite \u2018fish\u2019 that \nformed concurrently with C-S fabric development, yielded Rb-Sr ages calculated with \nfeldspar that accurately reflected the age of shearing.  Because the closure \ntemperature for Sr diffusion in muscovite is about 500oC, the mica grew more than \n100oC below its closure temperature, a condition ensuring full radiogenic Sr retention \nand a robust age determination; these mica ages are shown in the thermal history of \nfigure 1.  \n \nAllanite-monazite equilibria in retrogressed rocks \nThere are several good examples of reaction textures involving allanite, monazite, \napatite, and\/or thorite from samples exposed to either a subsequent metamorphic \nevent or a retrogressive metamorphism following peak temperature.  Finger et al \n(1998), Fraser (2000), and Simpson et al. (2000) describe granitoid and\/or pelitic \nsamples that contain monazite surrounded by a complex reaction rim involving \napatite, allanite, and\/or thorite.  This is probably a retrogressive reaction involving the \naddition of water, possibly represented by the equation, \n \nmonazite + calcic plagioclase + water =  \nallanite + apatite + thorite  + Ca-poorer plagioclase  \n \nIn these studies, these striking textures (Figures 3c, d) have failed to progress to \ncompletion, probably limited by diffusion and possibly the availability of water.  \nTheir importance lies in the potential to date the retrogressive reaction by in situ \nisotopic techniques, and hypothetically, to determine P-T conditions of such reactions. \nBecause little is known of the phase equilibria of the CaO-REE-Phosphate-ThO-H2O \nsystem in rocks, quantitative P-T-fluid conditions cannot be determined at present. \n \nSummary \nNotwithstanding the fact that most dating studies focus on determining protolith ages, \nthe age of peak metamorphism, and\/or the age of deformation events using magmatic \n14 \nrocks, there is much to be learned about the full temperature-time path and the \nresponse of rocks to reworking by the study of accessory minerals. Minerals other \nthan zircon, namely allanite, monazite, titanite, and rutile often provide key \ninformation pertaining to the full thermal and metamorphic history of samples.  This \nis possible because of their differential retention of radiogenic Pb, their structural \nability to withstand intense recrystallisation of the rock\u2019s matrix, and the nature of the \nU-Th-Pb isotope systematics.  The understanding of the thermochemistry of mineral \nreactions involving accessory phases is in its infancy, but fascinating textures \ninvolving these minerals indicate that they are dynamically responding to changing \nenvironmental conditions during subsequent events.  Careful study of complex \nsamples can reveal both protolith crystallisation ages, protolith cooling ages, ages of \nthe subsequent metamorphic-deformational event, and semi-quantitative information \nabout the temperature and duration of subsequent events.  The number of careful \nstudies in this field is small at present, but is increasing steadily.  The ability of \naccessory minerals and in some cases other rock forming minerals (micas) to record \ncomplexities of the chronology within a rock\u2019s reacting matrix ensures that fruitful \nresearch in this field will continue for years to come. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe author thanks T.

Valhalla core complex thermal history, from Spear and Parrish (1996). The \nmineral chronometers used allow the reconstruction of the full cooling history of \nthis high-grade terrain, with an average rate of cooling of about 25oC\/Ma.  Higher \nrates of short-lived cooling may have occurred  immediately after reaching peak \ntemperatures, possibly the result of thrust juxtaposition at deep crustal levels, as \nsuggested by the dotted line. Fission track ages vary with altitude with a total \nrange of nearly 20 Ma.  Note that the temperature used for the Rb-Sr muscovite \nage of ca. 55 Ma is not the Rb-Sr muscovite closure temperature from Table 1, \nbecause the dated mica grew at lower greenschist facies metamorphic conditions \n(about 400oC), well below the nominal 500oC closure temperature; this muscovite \nis therefore not a cooling age. \n2. Photographs of Early Proterozoic structures re-worked by a Tertiary structural-\nmetamorphic event in British Columbia. (a) Folded gneissosity developed in 2.1 \nGa orthogneiss and amphibolite, cut by foliated 2.05 Ga amphibolite dyke, and \nthen deformed during subsequent events at 1.85 Ga and 50-60 Ma; hammer is 30 \ncm in length. (b) Folded and sheared ortho- and paragneisses of 1.86-2.2 Ga age \nthat were subsequently deformed 50-60 Ma ago.  A variety of structures can be \ndiscerned, the latest of which are about 50 Ma old. The person standing is 1.6m in \nheight. \n3. U-Pb concordia showing a summary of more than 50 analyses of zircon, monazite \nand titanite from rocks of the Monashee Complex of  southeastern British \nColumbia, drawing on the work of Parrish (1995), Crowley (1999) and Crowley \nand Parrish (1999).  The rocks dated consist of Early Proterozoic gneiss with a \nstrong ca. 1.85 Ga orogenic signature that were involved in a subsequent orogenic \nevent under amphibolite facies conditions approximately 50-60 Ma ago.  During \nthe younger event the Monashee Complex footwall as overthrust by a thick \nallochthon (the Selkirk allochthon) undergoing uppermost amphibolite facies \nmetamorphism, and this juxtaposition preserved inverted metamorphic isograds in \nthe sheared footwall.  Accessory minerals from Neoproterozoic gneisses  of the \nfootwall were disturbed by Pb loss and new mineral growth during the 50-60 Ma \n16 \nevent, and the effect of this event was more intense at higher structural levels.  In \nthe figure, the field of analyses from the deeper structural levels are shown as the \nthree larger patterned boxes with the least discordance.  Note that titanite is more \ndiscordant than monazite.  The highest grade of metamorphism in the footwall is \njust beneath the decollement and the analyses from these samples show much \ngreater discordance and substantial new mineral growth.  The discordance of \nminerals is likely the result of radiogenic Pb loss and\/or new crystal growth onto \nan existing mineral.  Studies of this type clearly demonstrate that the relative \nretentivity of Pb for monazite is higher than titanite. \n4. Scanning electron micrographs of reaction textures involving accessory minerals. \n(a) back scattered electron microscope image of metamorphic zircon replacing  \nbaddeleyite (ZrO2), in coronitic reaction textures within gabbroic rocks of the \nmetamorphosed Sudbury dykes of Ontario (Davidson & van Breemen 1988); (b) \nsecondary electron image of rutile replaced by titanite \u2018buds\u2019 in the retrogressed \neclogite from Glenelg, Scotland; note the similar morphology of these \nreplacement grains to those of figure (a); (c) backscattered electron image of \napatite and zoned allanite-epidote corona surrounding a core of monazite, \nevidence of monazite breakdown in schist in the Hunza region of northern \nPakistan;  (d) backscattered electron image of monazite breakdown reaction to \nproduce a core of apatite + thorite (all monazite appears to have reacted, though \nsome small relicts may be preserved in the bright central region), surrounded by \nREE-zoned allanite-epidote, also from Hunza, Pakistan; (e) secondary electron \nimage of metamorphic zircon with round aspect, growing in retrogressed zone \nwithin eclogite, from near Glenelg, Scotland. \n5. Microscopic images of external and internal morphologies of zircon from re-\nworked gniessic rocks.  Scale bar on all images are 100 \u03bcm.  (a) secondary \nelectron image of 55 Ma metamorphic zircon growing in the solid state in a \nmetamorphised 740 Ma nepheline syenite gneiss from the Monashee Complex of \nBritish Columbia; (b) transmitted light image of highly irregular shapes of zircon \nfrom a recrystallised mylonite developed from a 100 Ma hornblende-biotite \ngrantoic protolith of the Valhalla Complex of southern British Columbia.  The \nirregularity of the grains is predominantly  the result of strong resorption of \n17 \nigneous grains, and comparison of some of these shapes to that of figure (e) \nindicates strong similarities; (c) secondary electron image of 50 Ma anhedral \nmetamorphic zircon grown in the solid state in a hornblende-plagioclase \namphibolite of probable Late Palaeozoic age, with multiple planar growth faces \nthat do not clearly correspond to crystallographic faces; southern British \nColumbia; (d) secondary electron image of moderately resorbed subhedral zircon \nwith significant metamorphically-induced rounding of crystal faces, Valhalla \nComplex of southern British Columbia; (e) backscattered electron image of etched \ninternal surface of highly resorbed Early Proterozoic zircon from ca.1.95 Ga \ngranulite facies Thelon tectonic zone of the northwest Canadian Shield.  The >2.0 \nGa core is overgrown by new zircon of ca. 1.95 Ga age; note the overall round \nshape masking the internal complexity and evidence of strong resorption; (f) \nbackscattered electron image of composite granulite facies zircon from mylonitic \nstraight gneiss of the Thelon zone, northwest Canadian Shield; the resorbed >2.0 \nGa core is overgrown by a complex region of wedge-shaped growth zones, most \nof which are in turn truncated and overgrown by new zones, resembling \u2018cross-\nstratification; this may have been produced by repeated dissolution and \nprecipitation of zircon rotating in the rock fabric during shearing, exposing sides \nof the crystal to differential chemical and strain gradients during rotation.  \n6. U-Pb concordia diagram of zircon, allanite and titanite from granitic rocks \nreworked by subsequent upper amphibolite facies heating and recrystallisation. \nThese samples are from the metamorphic core zone of southeast British Columbia, \nincluding the Selkirk Allochthon and Valhalla Complex.  (a) the 100 Ma Mulvey \ngneiss of the Valhalla Complex (Spear & Parrish 1995) with clear separation of \nzircon, allanite, and titanite analyses illustrating variable Pb loss; (b) similar \npattern of discordance within Devonian orthogneiss of the Selkirk Allochthon (see \nHeaman & Parrish 1991).  Both samples were thoroughly recrystallised at ca. 60 \nMa during metamorphism and deformation. Although experiencing some \nresorption and new crystal growth, the accessory minerals preserve some of the \nisotopic signature of the protolith, indicating that Pb loss was not complete. This \nproves that allanite and titanite did not undergo the thorough  recystallisation \nexperienced by the matrix minerals. \n18 \nReferences \nArmstrong, R. L. 1966.
