Email: r.mcaleese@hw.ac.uk\nAn extended review of John S. Daniel's Mega-Universities and the Knowledge Media:\nTechnology Strategies for Higher Education (London: Kogan Page, 1996; 212 pages,\nISBN: 0-7494-2119-3).\nI will start with a declaration of interest and prejudice. I have been for some thirty years a\n'learning technologist', or what used to be unfashionably called an 'educational techno-\nlogist'. I have observed and read books, chapters and papers by John Daniel, the author of\nthis work, for about twenty years, since his days in Concordia University, Montreal.\nProfessor Daniel is without peer as a judge of continuing, open and distance education. As\nVice-Chancellor of the Open University, he has seen his institution grow to a leading\nposition in the UK open-learning market with hundreds of courses offered under its\ninimitable course-design system. He has ensured that the Open University is a beacon of\nwhat is best in innovative teaching and programme delivery. He has steered an adept\ncourse, gaining widespread international approval for the prototypical University of the\nAir. His views are canvassed by the Great and the Good. One can discern his hand in the\nrecent Dealing (1997) recommendations.\nWhy, then, do I feel uncomfortable with this book? I started this review almost a year ago,\njust in time for the publication of the Dealing Report in the summer of 1997.1 thought, as\nI read more and more of the book, that I wanted to say Yes. But I also wanted to argue. I\nwanted to contest, to say: 'It's not like that. I don't like the way you describe what you\nclaim we do.'\nThe thrust of Daniel's argument is that there is a global crisis in the old world of higher\neducation. Universities have a window of opportunity to take advantage of developments\nin information and communications technology. Knowledge media have become a\ncommodity that is attractive to entrepreneurs and students alike. Sufficient is known of\ncompetitive advantage between organizations to draw up strategic guidelines for innovative\ninstitutional plans. Further, there are tried and tested implementations strategies for\n68\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\ntechnology-based teaching drawn from organizational change and development. All these\ndevelopments will allow the old-world universities to become, like the Open University,\nsuccessful mega-universities. The argument is simple. The evidence is well documented (the\nbook's origin is in a doctoral dissertation written during a sabbatical leave). The writing is\neasy.\nSo what, again, is it that makes this book uncomfortable reading for me? If one takes\nDaniel's logical analysis of competitive advantage, the reason is soon apparent. He starts\nhis argument with the premise that rational economic analysis is appropriate for the output\nof universities. He asserts that students are outputs and the buyer is the State. Further, and\nby implication, students themselves buy universities as consumers. Some (for example,\nHobbs, 1998) have doubted if such a rational cost-sensitive demand exists, and if it does,\nhow it is characterized. Interestingly, this recursive consumerism is currently exhibiting a\ndecline in demand because the price of the product has just been gazumped by the\nGovernment. The introduction of the \u00a31,000 fee is highlighting the complex supply and\ndemand system that operates. This effect suggests that universities may have a product\n('knowledge') and that students will value and pay for it, just as they would for any other\ncommodity. Daniel's market-based economic analysis goes on to suggest that students, in\nturn, acquire 'skills' through just-in-time delivery of courses in what Tom King et al. in\nanother irritating book, so inelegantly call 'learn-places' (Ford et al, 1996; see reviews of\nthis book in ALT-J, 5 (2), 64-74). The fact is that student demand has crossed a cusp.\nPerhaps there really are market forces at work. Not only is there a demographic-led\nincrease, but perhaps also a rational market-led decrease. In 1998, the most recent figures\nfrom UCAS suggest that there is a definite decline in the number of applicants for\nuniversity places in UK. Daniel is able to conclude that universities should focus on five\ncore activities, namely: 'inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and\nsales' (p.73).\nThe issue I sense here is the use of a commodity-oriented framework that seems and feels\nwrong for my understanding of a university. My orientation to universities is more in\nkeeping with Bruce Truscot's (1943) much maligned Red Brick University, or the collegial-\nity of the pre-Robbins community of scholars, rather than the consumerism of the modern\n'mega-university' system. To me, the language of description and analysis seems to ignore\nwhat universities do best. I feel that universities should concentrate on educating young\npeople. It is as simple as that. Universities should provide a scholarly and rigorous\nframework for the creation and adoption of scientific knowledge. Universities, after all,\nconsist of scholar-teachers who engage with learners in a shared activity - teaching and\nlearning - based on post-Newman scholarship. Now, it is logical and feasible to analyse\nany system using a different framework. Such a device is often used by social scientists who\nsuggest, for example, an epidemiological model for the adoption of new ideas. It is as if\nideas propagate, disseminate and are curtailed in a way that is similar to the growth of a\nbiological epidemic. They.use this socio-medical framework to suggest interesting new\ninsights. However, unlike my reading of Daniel, they do not go on from a useful analytical\nframework to a deterministic projection of how things should be. Normative determinism,\nbased on an interesting but inappropriate framework is a characteristic I sense in Daniel's\nbook. The analysis of the 'value chain' - logical and appropriate to such as the electronics\nindustry - seems a wholly inappropriate way to understand how universities can make the\n69\nRay McAleese Comment the coming tornado?\nmost of technological opportunities to facilitate learning and scholarship. It does not seem\nlike that to me.\nThe reality of being a student or a teacher in higher education may of course be different\nfrom the noble aspirations I allude to above. Teaching is a job just like many others in a\nservice industry. There are clients who have expectations, and the teachers meet these\nexpectations in a professional way. They share their expertise through well-tried teaching\nmethods, while at the same time keeping abreast of their subject discipline and\ncontributing to the success of their institution through research and consultancy. Likewise,\nstudents have a need to acquire paper qualifications that certify them as being competent\nand employable. Their 'graduateness', while comprising both transferable skills and\nsubject-based skills, is judged by their ability to perform traditional tests of recall,\nevaluation and communication. And the reality, as seen from the shop floor, is of many\nteaching staff and researchers disaffected with the inexorable drive to research output and\nefficiency. The workforce is under-skilled and sometimes untrained. Its ability to make the\nmost of communications and information technology hangs on initiatives that aim to\ndisseminate best practice, and on painfully short induction courses to the complexities of\n'teaching over the Web' and 'automatic assessment using self-marked tests'. Most teachers\nwant to help learners understand what they need in order to be successful, not to acquire a\nnew set of professional skills for which they will receive no direct reward.\nThe experience of being a student is no less confusing. Many students - up to a third in\nsome instances - come to university with almost no communications or IT skills. They\nhave experienced traditional or neo-traditional teaching methods in schools, and their only\nability to reflect on their competencies has been in preparing a short CV for a summer job.\nWhen they are invited to take responsibility for their own learning and to seek out\ninformation for themselves in order to satisfy the requirements of distant teachers, they cry\nfor help and consume a disproportionate amount of tutoring time. Often, the teacher and\nthe taught are both on a voyage of discovery into the complexities of a computer-\nsupported collaborative learning environment. The reality is that while there is much to be\nsaid for communications and information technology in higher education, there are few\nlistening and few with the minimum set of skills to achieve 'take-off. If this were not true,\nwhy should the Funding Councils support initiatives such as TLTP and LTDI? There is a\ncrisis with under-skilled staff and students. There are solutions to problems that do not\nexist and no solutions for problems that do exist. A reasonable view might be to\nconcentrate our efforts on a better understanding of the process of learning - using the\nexisting technologies - before starting on a head-long rush to re-skill, re-learn and re-\norganize. There is a respectable argument that suggests: Do what you do best well, before\nyour do hew things. I only wish John Daniel had placed more weight in Chapters 2 and 3\non the book by his colleague Diana Laurillard (Laurillard, 1993). When she asked what\nstudents bring to learning, and examined the 'complexity of coming to know', she touched\non the essential ingredient for a successful higher-education business: an understanding of\nthe customer.\nIn a chapter entitled Making Technology Attractive (Chapter 6), Daniel uses Moore's\n(1995) 'technology life-cycle' to argue the case for capitalizing on technology to 'dominate\nthe niche' (p. 90). Daniel asserts: 'The organisation that develops whole products success-\nfully in a series of niches may create a tornado as the mass market takes off' (p. 93). The\n70\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\ntornado concept - an unstoppable advance through synergistic alliances - allows, as Daniel\nparaphrases Moore, 'large numbers of customers to enter the market simultaneously,\nswamping the supply system and creating a frenzy' (p. 94). The implication is clear for\nthose who wish to see it. Technology is going to support learners and institutions, but only\nthose who move forward using the technology paradigm will survive. Only those institu-\ntions who see their competitive advantage being served by buying into distance learning,\nopen systems and communications and information technology will be the real players. It is\nalmost like the tornado that blows the smaller football clubs away when the Premier clubs\nstrike deals with the media to take them to a state of higher turnover and profitability. The\ncomparison between soccer and scholarship is not only close; it offers an opportunity to\nconsider the impact of competitive advantage on those who still enjoy standing on the\nterraces supporting local heroes.\nNow, this is where one can see the full impact of Daniel's' argument. In the real world,\ntechnology-supported infra-structures are differentiating between those that are keeping\nup and those that will have to change or be left behind. The higher-education system is\ninfected with the competitive spirit. Attracting punters (sic) is now an every-day job for\neach and every one of us. To offer better opportunities to learn through Metropolitan Area\nNetworks; to share applications over distributed systems, and to be a member of a virtual\ncommunity of learners is what we are told should be attracting more students . John\nDaniel may be right, but I do not like it. I feel exposed. I may have to change my cost\nstance. I may have to reflect on what I should do, not what I like doing.\nTurning to the core issue, 'knowledge-media', may present an attractive proposition as far\nas learning technology is concerned. Daniel draws heavily on his well-informed Open\nUniversity colleagues Diana Laurillard and Mark Eisenstadt. It is Eisenstadt's 'knowledge-\nmedia' that offers such an attractive term in the title of the book. The observed\nconvergence of telecommunications and computing, along with the cognitive and learning\nsciences, has suggested this term to Eisenstadt. The key assumption by Eisenstadt is the\nbelief that the increased 'bandwidth' of what Dealing was later to call the communications\nand information technologies, gives rise to qualitative differences in what can be learned\nand what is learned. Because it is possible to push terabytes out over a network, it is\npossible now to create new virtual learning environments - so the argument goes. No\nlonger do students have to wait at their modems for a trickle of bytes at 1200 Baud to\ndownload the tutor's comments on their assignments. Students can make the most of\ndistant tutors who can see, hear and almost touch the cyber-learners. Of course, there is a\nlot of sense in this chapter (Chapter 7). Diana Laurillard - who herself made a highly\nsignificant contribution to the Dearing Committee and Report - has previously offered a\n'conversational framework' for understanding how learning is facilitated. This\nconversation facilitates the social aspect of learning. Learning, according to Laurillard is\ndiscursive, adaptive, interactive and reflective. Her analysis, first widely publicised in Re-\nThinking University Teaching (Laurillard, 1993) is clearly referred to by Daniel, but I feel he\ndoes not make the most of her analysis. Perhaps in a similar way, the conclusions of the\nMacFarlane Report (1992) paid lip-service to the thorough analysis of Entwistle et al who\nprovided the pedagogy for the report's Intensely Supportive Learning Environments\n(MacFarlane, 1995). MacFarlane (1992) himself placed a high premium on making\nlearning 'more productive and efficient by harnessing modern technology' (p. 13). On a\n71\nRay McAleese Comment the conning tornado?\nlarger canvas, Daniel seems to prefer the artefacts that emanate from 'knowledge-media' to\nthe cybernetic negotiation of understandings between teachers and students mediated\nthrough communications media. In summary, Daniel concludes: 'Universities need to do\nconsiderable development work if they are to derive full advantage from opportunities\nsuch as on-line tutoring and the Internet' (p. 135). Here, again, I can see the road ahead like\n. the Bill Gates vision. The potential to place the cart (the technology artefacts) before the\nhorse (the instructional technology of Laurillard's 'conversational system') is all too\napparent.\nSo what is it in this book that has made me read it, re-read it, think about it, talk about it,\ncite it, hate it? It is the logic of Daniel's argument. I fear he is right. I may have been left\nbehind. The world out there that allows me to support my students through my mail\nsystem while I write this passage at home. The ability of high-performance workstations to\nmodel complex process and allow learners to engage in their own learning process is here -\nnow. I suspect the real impact of John Daniel's' book will be that it brings out in each of us\n- in a cathartic exorcism - the deepest, darkest feeling that we have been dinosaurs in a\npark, owned and run by the entrepreneurial knowledge-scientists.\nThis reminds me of the way Barbara Falk, the Grand Lady of Australian staff\ndevelopment in the 1970s, alluded to the role of the successful staff developer as being like\n'a professional irritant'. The successful staff developer makes others 'scratch'. It is perhaps\nDaniel's role in writing this book, from the authority of his long experience, to irritate the\nrest of us into new ways of seeing the world. If the reader wants to know: how to initiate\nchange; what the new language of innovative teaching is; how to get one over on the next\ndepartment\/college\/ system, then this book will be essential reading. If the reader wants to\nunderstand what is known about learning and scholarship under communications and\ninformation technology, there are pointers galore. If the reader wants to impress the\nsenior-management team with an awareness of the next window of opportunity, this book\nis required reading. I still want to know more of the 'ethnographic' studies Daniel refers to\nthat explicate the process of learning. I want to know what will happen when the current\nwave of communications and information technology is superseded by new and as yet un-\nthought of artefacts. I want to know how I am to compete for attention as a learning\ntechnologist, without selling cosy scholarly principles to The Grim Technology Reaper.\nBut before I change my name to Faust, I have to acknowledge a debt to Professor Daniel. I\njourneyed through his book and wriggled on every page. Yet I have now read it cover to\ncover on three occasions. I feel I will do so again.\nFor more down-to-earth readers, the book has eight well written chapters, a fascinating set\nof biographies of existing 'mega-universities' in the Appendix, and a useful bibliography to\nset them off verifying, corroborating, testing Daniel's assertions. May their journey be\ninteresting.\nReferences\nDearing et al (1997), Higher Education in the Learning Society: Report of the National\nCommittee of Inquiry into Higher Education, London: HMSO and NCIHE Publications.\nFord, P. et al (1996), Managing Change in Higher Education: A Learning Environment\nArchitecture, London: Open University Press.\n72\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nHobbs, P.
