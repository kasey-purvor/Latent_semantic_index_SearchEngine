Introduction\nBy stating that psychological states survive death, one is\ncommitting to a radical form of mind-body dualism. Yet\nthis radicalism is especially common. In the United\nStates alone, 95% of the population reportedly believes\nin life after death (Greeley & Hout 1999; Lester et al.\n2002). The majority of people from other societies, as\nwell, see death as a transitional event that unbuckles the\nethereal self from its body. The soul is typically rep-\nresented as the conscious personality of the decedent\nand the once animating force of the now inert physical\nform (Thalbourne 1996). Although there are many var-\nieties of afterlife beliefs, each \u2013 at least implicitly \u2013 shares\na dualistic view of the self as being initially contained in\nbodily mass and as exiting or taking temporary leave of1\nthe body at some point after the body\u2019s expiration\n(Bloom 2004; Boyer 2001).\nThere is clear evidence showing that emotive factors can\nbe powerful contributors to people\u2019s belief in life after\ndeath (e.g., Alvarado et al. 1995; Dechesne et al. 2003;\nThalbourne 1996). In general, psychologists who study\nthis area have tended to focus on individual differences,\nspecifically the role of death anxiety, and have posited a\nvariety of \u201ccomfort hypotheses\u201d involving the human\nmotivation to construct such supernatural beliefs. In con-\ntrast, less is known about the basic components underlying\nthe strong cognitive bias to entertain belief in an immortal\nsoul (Astuti, forthcoming a). These more basic questions\nconcerning the cognitive architecture behind afterlife rep-\nresentations are also important pieces of the puzzle and\nwill be explicitly addressed in the present article. What-\never one\u2019s personal motivations for rejecting or endorsing\nthe idea of an immaterial soul that can defy physical death,\nthe ability to form any opinion on the matter would be\nabsent if not for our species\u2019 defining capacity to differ-\nentiate unobservable minds from observable bodies\n(Povinelli & Bering 2002; Suddendorf & Whiten 2001;\nTomasello & Call 1997).\nSome researchers have already begun laboratory inves-\ntigations into the question of whether humans are\n\u201ccommon sense dualists,\u201d work that seems to have impli-\ncations for our understanding of people\u2019s intuitive con-\nceptions of souls and the afterlife (see Bloom 2004).\nFor example, in a modification of the classic expectancy\nviolation paradigm (which uses looking time as a measure\nof nonverbal infants\u2019 \u201csurprise\u201d at an event), Kuhlmeier\net al. (2004) positioned identical twin experimenters at\ndifferent points in the laboratory to test 5-month-olds\u2019\nBERING JESSE, Reader in the School History and\nAnthropology Departments and Director of the Insti-\ntute of Cognition and Culture, Queen\u2019s University\nBelfast, has focused his work on the psychological foun-\ndations of supernatural belief. An experimental cogni-\ntive scientist, he is also a specialist in the evolutionary\nbases of religion.\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29, 453\u2013498\nPrinted in the United States of America\n# 2006 Cambridge University Press 0140-525X\/06 $12.50 453\nability to reason about the law of continuous motion as it\napplies to human bodies. Like any material substance,\nhuman bodies cannot go from A! C without first\npassing along the trajectory of B (a contiguous space\nbetween the two points). For inanimate objects, infants\nare surprised (i.e., look longer) when the object disappears\nfrom behind one barrier and then seems to reemerge from\nbehind another nonadjacent barrier. In the case of a\nhuman who violates the law of continuous motion,\nhowever, 5-month-olds are not surprised (i.e., they do\nnot look longer at this event than the non-violation\nevent). The authors speculate that \u201cinfants do not readily\nview humans as material objects\u201d (Kuhlmeier et al. 2004,\np. 101) and that an \u201cappreciation that people are just\nobjects may be a developmental accomplishment\u201d\n(p. 102; emphasis in original).\nBut how do we get from the common-sense dualism of\ninfants to beliefs of the afterlife so soberly entertained by\nadults? Even a superficial pass over such beliefs strikes one\nas involving many of the core problems in cognitive\nscience: causal attribution (how is mortal behavior causally\nrelated to one\u2019s afterlife? how are dead agents envisaged as\ncommunicating messages to the living?), moral judgment\n(why are certain social behaviors, i.e., transgressions,\nbelieved to have ultimate repercussions after death or to\nreap the punishment of disgruntled ancestors?), theory\nof mind (how can we know what it is \u201clike\u201d to be dead?\nwhat social-cognitive strategies do people use to reason\nabout the minds of the dead?), concept acquisition (how\ndoes a common-sense dualism interact with a formalized\nsocio-religious indoctrination in childhood? how are\nsupernatural properties of the dead conceptualized by\nyoung minds?), teleological reasoning (why do people so\noften see their lives as being designed for a purpose\nthat must be accomplished before they perish? how do\nvarious life events affect people\u2019s interpretation of this\npurpose?), and so on.\nIn what follows, I examine how this human folk psycho-\nlogy of souls, as well as closely related supernatural beliefs,\nmay open an empirical backdoor to our understanding of\nthe evolution of human social cognition. Recent findings\nand logic from the cognitive sciences contribute to a\nnovel theory of existential psychology, one that is\ngrounded in the tenets of Darwinian natural selection.\nThe central thesis of the present article is that an orga-\nnized cognitive \u201csystem\u201d dedicated to forming illusory\nrepresentations of (1) psychological immortality, (2) the\nintelligent design of the self, and (3) the symbolic meaning\nof natural events evolved in response to the unique selective\npressures of the human social environment.\n2. Psychological immortality as a cognitive\ndefault\nI\u2019m a materialist, I swear it to you; I\u2019m not going crazy. But\nsomething\u2019s the matter. I see my corpse; that\u2019s not hard but\nI\u2019m the one who sees it, with my eyes. I\u2019ve got to think . . .\nthink that I won\u2019t see anything anymore and the world will\ngo on for the others. We aren\u2019t made to think that.\n\u2014 Jean-Paul Sartre (1937\/1969), The Wall:\nAnd Other Stories\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, it is important to first\nask whether humans \u201cnaturally\u201d reason about death as a\ntransitional state of consciousness or simply acquire such\nideas through cultural exposure (perhaps from adults\nwho \u201cinvent\u201d such notions to ameliorate their own death\nanxiety; see, e.g., Dechesne et al. 2003; Harris &\nGime\u00b4nez 2005). Although conventional wisdom tends to\nfavor a general learning hypothesis for the origins of after-\nlife beliefs, recent findings suggest a more complicated\ndevelopmental picture.\nFor example, in a study by Bering and Bjorklund (2004),\nchildren (as well as an adult comparison group) were\npresented with a puppet show in which an anthropomor-\nphized mouse was killed and eaten by an alligator, and\nthen asked about the biological and psychological func-\ntioning of the now-dead mouse. Kindergartners under-\nstood that various biological imperatives (e.g., the\ncapacity to be sick, the need to eat, drink, and relieve\noneself) no longer applied to the dead mouse. The\nmajority of these children even said that the brain of the\ndead mouse no longer worked, which is especially telling\ngiven that children at this age also understand that the\nbrain is \u201cfor thinking\u201d (Bloom 2004; Gottfried & Jow\n2003; Johnson & Wellman 1982; Slaughter & Lyons 2003).\nYet when asked whether the dead mouse was hungry or\nthirsty, or whether it was thinking or had knowledge,\nmost kindergartners said yes. In other words, young\nchildren were cognizant of the fact that the body stops\nworking at death but they viewed the mind as still active.\nFurthermore, both the children and adults were particu-\nlarly likely to attribute to the dead mouse the capacity\nfor certain psychological states (i.e., emotions, desires,\nand epistemic states) over others (i.e., psychobiological\nand perceptual states), a significant trend that will be\naddressed in the following section.\nIn general, however, kindergartners were more apt to\nmake psychological attributions to the dead mouse than\nwere older children, who were not different from adults\nin this regard. This is precisely the opposite pattern that\none would expect to find if the origins of such beliefs\ncould be traced exclusively to cultural indoctrination. In\nfact, religious or eschatological-type answers (e.g.,\nHeaven, God, spirits, etc.) among the youngest children\nwere extraordinarily rare. Thus, a general belief in the\ncontinuity of mental states in dead agents seems not some-\nthing that children acquire as a product of their social\u2013\nreligious upbringing, because increasing exposure to\ncultural norms would increase rather than attenuate after-\nlife beliefs in young minds. Instead, a natural disposition\ntoward afterlife beliefs is more likely the default cognitive\nstance and interacts with various learning channels (for an\nalternative interpretation, see Astuti, forthcoming a).\nMoreover, in a follow-up study that included Catholic\nschoolchildren, this incongruous pattern of biological\nand psychological attributions to the dead mouse appeared\neven after controlling for differences in religious education\n(Bering et al. 2005).\nUnlike intuitive reasoning about dead agents\u2019 bodies,\nwhich may help to motivate physical avoidance of these\ndangerous objects in the environment (via the emotion\nof disgust or agency detection mechanisms which err\non the side of caution for ambiguously dead\/sleeping\nagents; Barrett & Behne 2005; Rozin et al. 1993), intuitive\nreasoning about dead agents\u2019 minds would seem to leave\nopen the possibility for continued social relationships\nwith the dead.\nBering: The folk psychology of souls\n454 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\n2.1. The simulation constraint hypothesis and the\nafterlife\nOur own death is indeed unimaginable and whenever we make\nthe attempt to imagine it we can perceive that we really survive\nas spectators.\n\u2014 Sigmund Freud, Thoughts for the Times on War and Death\nTry to fill your consciousness with the representation of\nno-consciousness, and you will see the impossibility of it.\nThe effort to comprehend it causes the most tormenting\ndizziness. We cannot conceive of ourselves as not existing.\n\u2014 Miguel de Unamuno (1912\/1954), Tragic Sense of Life\nThe causal mechanisms that lead young children to\nrepresent dead agents\u2019 minds as being psychologically\nactive have yet to be precisely identified. Nevertheless,\nthere is evidence that simulation constraints (i.e., the\ninability to know what it is \u201clike\u201d to be dead) may comprise\nan important set of factors. Like reasoning about one\u2019s past\nmental states during dreamless sleep or while in other\nsomnambulistic states, consciously representing a final\nstate of unconsciousness poses formidable, if not impassa-\nble, cognitive constraints (Barrett 2004; Bering 2002a;\nBering & Bjorklund 2004; Bering et al. 2005; Clark 1994;\nGilbert 2001; Nichols, in press). By relying on simulation\nstrategies to derive information about the minds of dead\nagents, one would be compelled to put themselves \u201cinto\nthe shoes\u201d of such organisms, which is an impossible\nfeat. These constraints may lead to a number of telltale\nerrors, namely \u201cType I\u201d errors (inferring mental states\nwhen in fact there are none), regarding the psychological\nstatus of dead agents. Koocher (1973, p. 374) described,\nfor instance, how a group of children tested on death com-\nprehension reflected on what it might be like to be dead\n\u201cwith references to sleeping, feeling \u2018peaceful,\u2019 or simply\n\u2018being very dizzy\u2019.\u201d\nAttempts to simulate dead agents\u2019 minds may even\nresult in Type I errors made by adults who profess not\nto believe in the afterlife. Bering (2002a) found that\nwhen undergraduate students were asked to reason\nabout the psychological abilities of a protagonist who had\njust abruptly died in an automobile accident, even some\nparticipants who later classified themselves as \u201cextincti-\nvists\u201d (i.e., those who endorsed the statement \u201cwhat we\nthink of as the \u2018soul,\u2019 or conscious personality of a\nperson, ceases permanently when the body dies\u201d; after\nThalbourne 1996), nevertheless stated that the dead\nperson knew that he was dead.\nIn addition, there is reason to believe that certain types\nof mental states are more difficult to imagine being perma-\nnently without than are others. In the study by Bering and\nBjorklund (2004), for example, participants at every age\nwere more likely to attribute emotions, knowledge, and\ndesires to the dead mouse than that they were psychobio-\nlogical and perceptual states (see also Bering et al. 2005).\nThis may be understood in relation to children\u2019s growing\nscientific knowledge. With regard to psychobiological\nstates, such as hunger or thirst, Slaughter and her col-\nleagues have shown that once children display an under-\nstanding of the vitalistic purpose of the behaviors tied to\nthese states (i.e., that eating and drinking function to\nsustain life), this knowledge facilitates scientific reasoning\nabout death (Slaughter & Lyons 2003; Slaughter et al.\n1999). Indeed, children who appeal to a vitalistic biological\nframework when reasoning about human bodies are more\nprecocious in their understanding of death (Slaughter &\nLyons 2003).\nSimilarly, because perceptual states are closely tied to\nobvious bodily structures, children who possess teleo-\nfunctional biological knowledge about these structures\n(e.g., that ears are \u201cfor hearing\u201d) may begin to reason\nthat, so long as the body has stopped functioning, the\ncapacity for such states must also become defunct at\ndeath (O\u2019Neill & Chong 2001).\nIn addition, because individuals are aware from their\nown previous or current experiences what it is like, say,\nnot to be sleepy, not to hear, or not to be hungry, they\nmay draw from the phenomenal negation of such states\nand apply these experiences to the minds of dead agents.\nThus, in some cases, simulation may actually corroborate\nscientific knowledge and further reduce Type I errors.\nIn contrast to these categories of psychological states,\nhowever, the nature of the body\u2019s role in producing the\nsubjective experiences of emotions, desires, and beliefs\nseems not as amenable to children\u2019s scientific theories of\ndead minds (or, indeed, even to adults\u2019 formulation of\nscientific theories regarding phenomenal consciousness\nand the brain, e.g., qualia; see McGinn 1991). These\naspects of consciousness are not obviously related to the\nbody\u2019s survival, nor are they linked to external bodily\naccoutrements (i.e., sense organs) that become \u201cbroken\u201d\nby death. In the absence of scientific theory concerning\nthe isomorphic relationship between the brain and the\nmind, individuals may defer to a simulation strategy in\nreasoning about dead others, a strategy that inevitably\nleads to Type I errors for these particular mental capacities\n(Bering 2002a; Clark 1994; Gilbert 2001; Nichols, in\npress). Firsthand experiences with the phenomenal nega-\ntion of mental functions such as desires, emotions, and\nthought can never be had because these states are con-\nstantly \u201cturned on\u201d during conscious periods (e.g., it is\nepistemologically impossible to know what it is like not\nto think), making people inclined to impute these\ncapacities to dead agents. Indeed, in looking at partici-\npants\u2019 response latencies to state that a dead protagonist\nlacked the capacity for various mental states, Bering\n(2002a) reported that it took people longer to answer\nthat this was the case for \u201cdifficult-to-imagine-the-\nabsence-of\u201d states (e.g., desire: \u201cNow that he\u2019s dead,\ndoes he want to be alive?\u201d) than for \u201ceasy-to-imagine-\nthe-absence-of\u201d states (e.g., psychobiological: \u201cNow that\nhe\u2019s dead, is he still sleepy?\u201d).2\n2.2. Offline social reasoning: Why the afterlife\nis a place\nI forced myself to stop thinking of her as someone still some-\nwhere, if only in memory, still obscurely alive, breathing,\ndoing, moving, but as a shovelful of ashes; as a broken link, a\nbiological dead end, an eternal withdrawal from reality.\n\u2014 John Fowles (1978), The Magus\nIn addition to simulation constraints, there are other\naspects of human social cognition that may encourage\nattributions of continued psychological functioning to\ndead agents. When investigating peoples\u2019 intuitive\nconceptions of dead agents\u2019 minds, we are wise to remem-\nber, for instance, that human relationships are largely\ncharacterized by offline social events; those with whom\nwe have relationships are only periodically directly\nBering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 455\nobservable (e.g., Dunbar 1993; 2004). An offline social\nsystem leads us to tacitly assume that individuals with\nwhom we have relationships are engaged in actions even\nwhen we cannot observe them doing so. The fact that\nyour mother is not in the room at the moment does not\ncompromise your capacity to reason about her mind,\nthough obviously the accuracy of your social judgments\nwill be limited. When conjuring up her offline image you\nare likely to imagine her as somewhere and as doing some-\nthing \u2013 in the kitchen washing dishes, in bed sleeping,\nplaying squash with the neighbor, and so on. Similarly,\nthe dead are envisaged not as inanimate objects slowly\ndecomposing in situ under the earth, but instead as\nhaving relocated to some unobservable locale where they\nare very much \u201cliving\u201d their dead lives.\nWhen it comes to death, human cognition apparently is\nnot well equipped to update the list of players in our\ncomplex social rosters by accommodating the recent non-\nexistence of any one of them. This is especially the case, of\ncourse, for individuals who have played primary roles in\nour social lives, who did so for a long time, and who\nwere never presumed to be continuously stationary\nwhen they were out of our sight. Because our minds are\ndesigned for offline as well as online social processing,\nwe expect the periodic physical absence of social partners.\nCasual observation reveals that individuals will often, for\nexample, pick up the phone with the intention of calling\nthe decedent or fleetingly imagine how the decedent will\nreact when told about some good news, only to remember\nthat the person is not where they usually are \u2013 they have\n\u201cpassed on\u201d to someplace else.\nAlthough these automatic cognitions are probably the\nresidue of habitual social behaviors, they also reveal some-\nthing about the challenges faced by the human cognitive\nsystem when it attempts to process information concern-\ning the truth about dead agents\u2019 physical whereabouts. A\nperson who has recently died and whose body has\nalready been disposed of may continue to be processed\nby an offline social system for an undetermined period\nof time. This place error is seemingly compounded by non-\nnegotiable simulation constraints that tempt us into\nreasoning about these dead agents\u2019 continued psycho-\nlogical functioning (as discussed in the previous section).\n2.3.

Represen-\ntations of the afterlife are culturally recurrent, proximally\ndriven by emotions, frequently implicated in social and\nreproductive matters, and superficially fitted to the\necological niche in which the human organism develops\n(Bering & Bjorklund 2004; Dechesne et al. 2003;\nReynolds & Tanner 1995). These features are consistent\nwith what we know about the nature of psychological\nadaptations (Bjorklund & Pellegrini 2002; Tooby &\nCosmides 1992). This is not to say that specific afterlife\nbeliefs \u2013 the culturally variable vicissitudes of the\nhereafter \u2013 are direct products of natural selection. As\nwill soon be discussed, investigators such as Boyer\n(2001) and Atran (2002) have shown that the \u201cselection\u201d\nof explicit religious ideas occurs at the cultural level,\nwith the \u201csurvival\u201d of such ideas being a feature of their\nability to become ensconced in the evolved architecture\nof exposed human minds (Sperber & Hirschfeld 2004).\nInstead, it is to argue that the subtle contours of a uniquely\nhuman adapted design may stand out when closely exam-\nining the folk psychology of souls, an intuitive pattern of\nreasoning that does not appear to hinge on the presence\nof explicit religious concepts per se (Bering 2002a).\nBut how might a representational bias for envisioning\npersonal immortality have impacted the net genetic\nfitness of individual humans in ancestral environments?\nUnfortunately, among cognitive scientists, scant attention\nhas been paid to the evolutionary significance of the\nhuman capacity to represent the self sub specie aeternitatis\n(\u201cunder the aspect of eternity\u201d). Instead, many scholars\ncategorize afterlife concepts in the same way they do\nother types of religious concepts, as especially virulent\nstrains of culturally transmitted ideas that are highly effec-\ntive at pirating core cognitive architecture (Atran 2002;\nBoyer 2001; for an exception, see Baron-Cohen 1999).\nAccording to this perspective, only the cognitive architec-\nture itself can be the product of natural selection; religious\nideas are seen as simply being parasitic on this evolved\narchitecture \u2013 as nothing more than noise that shares a\ngeneral frequency between cultures (e.g., Pyysia\u00a8inen\n2001; Sperber & Hirschfeld 2004). For example, in his\nbook Religion Explained, Boyer (2001, p. 40) writes:\n\u201cPeople have religious notions and beliefs because they\nacquired them from other people. On the whole, people\nget their religion from other members of their social\ngroup.\u201d\nBoyer and other cultural epidemiologists\u2019 view afterlife\nconcepts, as well as other types of supernatural concepts,\nas unavoidable carryovers of cultural selection. Specifi-\ncally, Boyer (2000; 2001) has argued that religious ideas\nexploit information-processing mechanisms into paying\nattention to them because they violate ontological regu-\nlarities by hybridizing or transgressing natural categories\n(see also Mithen 1996). Thus, religious ideas are especially\nlikely to attach to evolved cognitive templates that are\ndesigned for reasoning about exemplars from natural cate-\ngories \u2013 such as PERSON or ANIMAL \u2013 because these\ntemplates act as flypaper for salient, \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d\ncases (Atran & Norenzayan 2004; Barrett 2000; 2004;\nPyysia\u00a8inen 2001; Slone 2004; Sperber & Hirschfeld 2004).\nAccording to Boyer (2003a), then, a ghost is a person\nwho is without a physical body and as such is a concep-\ntually seductive idea. The concept of an afterlife therefore\nis easily generated and transmitted between minds. Like\nall other religious concepts, however, it is otherwise\ntreated as a biologically sterile by-product.\nSimilarly, Sperber and Hirschfeld (2004, p. 44) write\nthat, \u201cexplaining religion by a religious disposition lacks\ninsight and plausibility.\u201d Instead, these scholars argue\nthat religion is a non-adaptive by-product (i.e., a spandrel),\none that arises through adapted human cognition acting\nin concert with culturally migrating counterintuitive con-\ncepts that change shape both within and between minds\n(for critical reviews, see Alcorta & Sosis 2005; Bulbulia\n2004; 2005; Sosis & Alcorta 2003).\nBering: The folk psychology of souls\n456 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\n2.4. Inhibition and the preservation of reputation\nI believe that I am in hell, therefore I am.\n\u2014Arthur Rimbaud (1873\/1999), A Season in Hell\nOnce the ability to entertain supernatural agent concepts\nevolved, such ideas might have led our ancestors to\ninhibit socially proscribed actions out of the fear that\ngods or dead agents, now \u201cfull access strategic agents,\u201d\nwere watching them (Boyer 2001). Some empirical\nsupport for this general argument was found in a recent\nstudy by Bering et al. (2005). In this study, undergraduate\nstudents who were casually told that a ghost was recently\nspotted in the laboratory were less willing to cheat on a\ncompetitive computer task \u2013 as measured by latency of\nresponse to delete the \u201caccidentally\u201d revealed answer \u2013\nwhen they were tested alone in the room than were\ncontrol participants who heard nothing of the fictitious\nghost (see also Burnham & Hare, in press; Haley &\nFessler 2005). In the case of supernatural beliefs, there-\nfore, it is helpful to highlight Haselton and Buss\u2019s (2003,\npp. 29\u201330) general adaptationist point that, \u201cthe human\nmind is designed to reason adaptively, not truthfully or\neven necessarily rationally.\u201d The genetic fitness effects of\nsuch behavioral inhibition have real currency in natural\nselection theory.\nThe relationship between supernatural morality and\nbehavioral inhibition is potentially a very important point\nfor evolutionary biologists. Because natural selection is\npragmatic, the illusion of a supernatural morality, if it\nserved to curb selfish behaviors and thus preserved\nsocial reputation in the ancestral past, may be an illusion\nby design (Alcorta & Sosis 2005; Bering 2005; Bering &\nJohnson 2005; Bering et al. 2005; Boyer 2001; Bulbulia\n2004; Dunbar 2004; Hinde 1999; Johnson & Kru\u00a8ger\n2004). Many writers have argued that, at some point in\nthe recent evolutionary past, hominid sociality underwent\na relatively abrupt shift that was characterized by strong\nselective forces operating on reputation-related behaviors\n(Alexander 1987, p. 110; Bering & Bjorklund, in press;\nBering & Shackelford 2004; Daly & Wilson 1994; Emler\n1994; Frank 1988; Goffman 1959, 1963; Hilton et al.\n1993; Schelling 1960; Wright 1994). Because of the risks\nassociated with social detection of selfish acts, and the\npeculiar \u201cstickiness\u201d of bad reputations (e.g., Baumeister\net al. 2001; Goffman 1963), psychological traits that facili-\ntated the inhibition of selfish acts were likely subjected to\nnatural selection. The costs of underestimating the risk of\nsocial detection would have been disproportionately\ngreater than the costs of prosocial decisions that were\ncontextually maladaptive. Even if altruism was costly\nevery time, if it avoided a lethal cost once, those other\ncosts would become negligible (Nettle 2004).\nExperimental findings of prosocial behavioral change in\nlight of supernatural primes (e.g., Bering et al. 2005) also\nlink up with the ethnographic database concerning after-\nlife beliefs. In some religious ideologies, the fate of the\nsoul after death is determined by the social behaviors of\nthe individual during life. Reflections on the ultimate con-\nsequences of (im)moral actions (e.g., whether the soul is\nexpelled to Hell or dissipated in nirvana) should be\ncapable of exerting a causal influence on today\u2019s overt\nbehavior, which would have the effect of preserving repu-\ntation by encouraging the inhibition of selfish acts or facil-\nitating self-control. In the United States, for example, the\nmajority (79%) of people believe that there will come a day\nwhen God judges them and decides whether they will go\nto Heaven or Hell (Gallup Organization 1999; see also\nLester et al. 2002). For current purposes, such poll data\nmay actually be misleadingly low. What people say they\nbelieve about the supernatural and how they implicitly\nreason are quite different things (Subbotsky 1997; 2001).\nScientific knowledge about causal relations between\nbehaviors and consequences may therefore destabilize\nthis adapted system, but more by overriding supernatural\nbeliefs than by replacing them (McCauley 2000;\nSubbotsky 2001).\nIn many traditionalist religious societies, the emphasis is\non worldly punishment for moral transgressions, whereby\nnorm violators are visited by sickness, poverty, or other\ntypes of misfortune (see Bering & Johnson 2005).\nMostly, punishment is seen as being imposed by\ndisgruntled ancestors (Hinde 1999; Reynolds & Tanner\n1995). In some cases, belief in the vicarious punishment\nof dead agents achieves similar prosocial effects. In medie-\nval Europe, where people\u2019s social behaviors were thought\nto determine the fate of dead loved ones whose souls were\nat limbo in purgatory, thoughts of the dead were so\nprevalent in the daily affairs of the living that at least one\nhistorian has even referred to the dead as constituting a\nseparate \u201cage group\u201d (Davis 1977; as cited in Luria 2001).\nAlthough critical developmental studies have yet to\nspecifically address the etiology of full-access strategic\nagent concepts and their consequences for behavioral\ninhibition, some related findings with young children do\npoint to a human cognitive system prepared to reason\nabout \u201comniscient\u201d supernatural agents (Bering 2005;\nBering & Johnson 2005). In a recent study, Barrett et al.\n(2001) report that because, theologically, God is\nall-knowing and therefore cannot hold false beliefs (and\ntherefore cannot be deceived), the social cognitive\nsystems of young children may be better suited to reason-\ning about the culturally postulated mind of God than about\nthe epistemologically limited minds of humans and other\nanimals. For example, whilst 3-year-olds incorrectly\nreason that a na\u0131\u00a8ve person knows the true contents of an\ninaccurately labeled box, they correctly reason (at least,\nin a theological sense) that God knows the true contents\nas well. Thus, according to the authors, because of\negocentric biases in early childhood, there may be cogni-\ntive precursors for full access strategic agent concepts\nthat developmentally precede even natural mental agent\nconcepts.\n3. Souls and intelligent design\nThe concept of man in the mind of God is comparable to the\nconcept of paper-cutter in the mind of the manufacturer, and,\nfollowing certain techniques and a conception, God produces\nman, just as the artisan, following a definition and a technique,\nmakes paper-cutter. Thus, the individual man is the realization\nof a certain concept in the divine intelligence.\n\u2014 Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism and Human Emotions\nHowever, to understand the relationship between belief in\ngods or other supernatural agents who are interested in\nour social behaviors and belief in immortal souls requires\nthat we disentangle several related strands of causal\nreasoning. Consider that if God does not exist, then the\nBering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 457\nunique self (i.e., the individual \u201csoul\u201d of any given person)\ncannot be the product of intelligent design; rather, it is\nsimply the end product of standard machinations of\ngenetic and environmental recombination. If the soul is\nnot the product of intelligent design, then there is no\nteleological function that it is designed to fulfill, no\nraison d\u2019e\u02c6tre to explain its existence beyond human attri-\nbutions of purpose. The task remains for cognitive scien-\ntists to determine why the teleological position is so\nfrequently adopted, and prospers so vehemently, over\nthe mechanistic alternative. The human mind cannot\nseem to easily accommodate itself to a godless, evolution-\nary canon when it comes to the self\u2019s existence.\nIn fact, resistance to the mechanistic theory of natural\nselection may have as much to do with a cognitive bias\ntoward intentionality as it does with an emotionally laden\nor moralistic bias. Recent findings converge to show that\nhumans have a strong teleological bent when it comes to\nreasoning about the origins of artifacts, animals, and\nnatural objects (e.g., Evans 2001; German & Barrett\n2005; Kelemen 2004; Kelemen & DiYanni 2005).\nKelemen (2004) has even gone so far as to dub children\n\u201cintuitive theists\u201d because of their so-called \u201cpromiscuous\nteleology.\u201d According to Kelemen, most young children\nwould prefer the teleo-functional explanation that a\ncloud is \u201cfor raining\u201d rather than assent to the exper-\nimenter\u2019s suggestion that perhaps raining is just something\nthat a cloud does. This cognitive bias shows that young\nchildren are \u201cendorsing the view that natural entities are\n\u2018made for something\u2019 and that is why they are here\u201d\n(Kelemen 2004, p. 295). In a similar vein, Evans and her\ncolleagues have found evidence that most young children\nprefer creationist arguments over evolutionary ones when\nreasoning about the origins of species (e.g., Evans 2001).\nTeleological reasoning is often applied to the origins of\nthe self, as well, such as talk about what one was \u201cborn to\ndo\u201d or that one is leading a life that he or she was not\n\u201cmeant for.\u201d Indeed, the term conceive (from the Latin\nconcipere, \u201cto take in and hold\u201d), though originally used\nto describe impregnation (\u201cto take into the womb,\nbecome pregnant\u201d), was within that same century (c.\n1280\u20131340) adopted to describe an intentional mental\nprocess (\u201cto take into the mind\u201d).\nThe tendency for people to reason about the special\npurpose of the unique self may differ from other forms\nof teleo-functional reasoning in two important ways.\nFirst, it appears to be much more resistant to scientific\nknowledge. Although teleo-functional beliefs about\nnatural objects are found in Romanian Gypsy adults, a\ngroup that does not possess scientific knowledge regarding\nnatural artifact origins (see Kelemen 2004), they generally\ndecline with age and are relatively rare among scientifi-\ncally educated adults. In contrast, ascriptions of intelligent\ndesign when reasoning about the purpose of individual\nlives appear to remain stable (and perhaps even increase)\nover the life course, probably due to the accrual and retro-\nspective interpretation of autobiographical experience\n(Bering 2003b; Bruner 2001; McAdams 2001).\nSecond, when it comes to lay beliefs about souls,\nattributions of purpose occur frequently for individual\nmembers of the same conceptual family. People tend\nto ascribe special purpose more often to the specific case \u2013\nsuch as \u201cwhat am I meant for?\u201d \u2013 than they ascribe shared\npurpose to members of the same natural category \u2013 such\nas \u201cwhat is the human species meant for?\u201d For no other\nnatural categories do such special teleological ascriptions\nseem to occur. (Imagine an evolutionary biologist hypothe-\nsizing about the special purpose of a specific heart of a\nspecific organism of all the possible such organisms\nwithin a given species.) Even for artifacts, teleo-functional\njudgments for class categories (e.g., CHAIR) appear to\ntrump within-category exemplars (e.g., both a gothic\nrevival style and a Chinoisserie style chair are \u201cfor\nsitting\u201d although they may differ in design for posturing\nthe body), and rarely occur within the exemplar class\nitself (e.g., the special purpose of an individual Chinoiss-\nerie style chair) (Defeyter & German 2003).\nThe categorical question \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d is important\nfor evolutionary analysis because it may set the stage for an\nobligatory social relationship between the self and its\npresumed supernatural creator. If this cognitive illusion,\nenriched with social affect, plays a causal role in generating\ngenetic fitness-enhancing responses (e.g., through the\nindividual\u2019s behavioral compliance with moral norms\nwhich the creator is believed to have authored), then an\nadaptationist hypothesis for the folk psychology of souls\ngains support.\nThe tendency to endow human lives with an a priori\nmeaning is particularly obvious in the wake of recent\nloss. Despite differences in religiosity, individuals who\nare in mourning commonly report feeling a sense of mean-\ninglessness (Davis & Nolen-Hoeksema 2001; Golsworthy &\nCoyle 1999; Smith et al. 1992; Yalom 1980). Such existen-\ntial despair, characteristic of the early stages of the grieving\nprocess, betrays people\u2019s implicit belief that they are part\nof a privileged social relationship with some abstract\nagent who exerts a causal influence over their everyday\nlives. Many types of \u201cpremature\u201d death (e.g., accidents,\nfatal illnesses, homicides) seem to force surviving individ-\nuals to acknowledge that this privileged social relationship\nis illusory: the existence of the self is abruptly surrendered\nto a veridical belief in the fundamental and mindless laws\nof natural probability. The resulting existential despair can\nbe attributed to the realization that the predictability and\ncontrollability of one\u2019s own death, like that of the dece-\ndent\u2019s, is in actuality very low.\nIn this light, there is no emotionally invested God who\nfavors or disfavors the continued survival of the self. Con-\nsequently, whatever social contracts previously entered\ninto with this nonexistent agent that led the self to\nexpect a reasonable deferment of death until old age are\nexposed as being spurious. Avenues by which individuals\nmay reenter into this illusory contract include \u201cjust\nworld\u201d beliefs (e.g., by reasoning that the person must\nhave been somehow deserving of death), and judging\nthat the decedent was different from themselves (and\nthus unlikely to have been in the same sort of privileged\nsocial relationship with God) (e.g., Hafer & Be`gue 2005;\nLerner 1980; Lerner & Miller 1978; Pyszczynski et al.\n1995).\nThe fact that most individuals do tend to reenter into\nthese illusory social contracts, even in the face of see-\nmingly egregious violations, suggests that the affective\npush to do so is capable of overthrowing any rationalist\nWeltanschauung. However, if this is the expression of an\nevolved system, as the current model alleges, then any\nexplicit philosophical position that discards meaning is\nnaturally disadvantaged, because the self can no sooner\nBering: The folk psychology of souls\n458 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\n\u201cchoose\u201d to be a subjective atheist than retinas can\n\u201cchoose\u201d not to convert light energy into signals that are\ncarried to the brain by the optic nerve (Bering 2005;\nMcCauley 2000). Adapted psychological systems, by\ndefinition, determine the way that information can be\nprocessed due to design solutions in the brain that were\nengineered by natural selection. In the present case, just\nas we can close our eyes to prevent light from being con-\nverted into neural signals, science may provide a minority\n(i.e., nonbelievers) with the armamentarium to close their\neyes to the supernatural.\n3.1. Suicide as a violation of intelligent design\nI condemn that nature which, with such impudent nerve,\nbrought me into being in order to suffer \u2013 I condemn it in\norder to be annihilated with me.\n\u2014Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1877\/1949), Diary of a Writer\nPublic opinions concerning suicide further serve to high-\nlight the role of the design stance in the existential\ndomain. Those who believe that one\u2019s life is owned by\nGod are more likely to view suicide \u2013 as well as abortion,\ncapital punishment, and medical euthanasia \u2013as being\nmorally wrong (Ross & Kaplan 1994; Worthen & Yeatts\n2001). It is not suicide per se that sheds light on this\nteleo-functional bias, but the moral repugnance for the\nact. Religious rules against suicide reveal a more\ncomplex cognitive stance than is immediately apparent.\nIt is a counterintuitive stance in which the self\u2019s will is\nseen as imposing itself over the will of the creator of the\nself\u2019s will. According to the premise that a person\u2019s life\nbelongs to God, an individual does not have the right to\npurposefully cause his or her own death, because this\nright is seen as being God\u2019s alone. This conception\nsuggests that suicide is viewed as a moral transgression\nin which an individual \u201ccheats\u201d God by stealing the\nlatter\u2019s power of intentionality in causing the self\u2019s death.\nSuicide therefore becomes a form of intellectual theft;\nthe self redesigns its end in an act of mutiny against its\ncreator.\nSuicide must be distinguished from acts of martyrdom,\nin which an individual engages in self-sacrifice as a political\nor wartime strategy (e.g., \u201csuicide bombers\u201d or kamikaze\npilots) (Atran 2003). Even here, however, we see how\nintentionality critically underlies the folk psychology of\nsouls. Although suicide is treated as a sin by many of the\nworld\u2019s religions, including Islam, those who are martyrs\nare seen by some religious adherents as having been\nchosen by God to fulfill His wishes and as being rewarded\nwith special experiential luxuries in the afterlife. For\nexample, during World War II, one of the most intense\nand successful military operations ever launched by\nJapanese fighter pilots against an American fleet was\ndeemed \u201cOperation Heaven\u201d by the Japanese commander\n(Blanchard n.d., p. 17), and \u201ckamikaze\u201d is literally\ntranslated as \u201cdivine wind.\u201d\nThe religious messages that are conveyed by charismatic\nleaders may be especially seductive because they capitalize\non an innate teleological bias for ascribing a special\npurpose to the unique self. For example, in a transcribed\ntelevision interview from CNN in 1997, Osama Bin\nLaden commented that: \u201cWe believe that no one can\ntake out one breath of our written life as ordained by\nAllah. We see that getting killed in the cause of Allah is\na great honor wished for by our Prophet.\u201d When juxta-\nposed with simulation constraints concerning what the\nafterlife may be \u201clike\u201d for those who sacrifice themselves\nfor prosocial in-group reasons, this becomes a particularly\nvolatile social cognitive phenomenon since martyrs are\npromised privileged states of consciousness after death.\nAs one member of the Palestinian group Hamas put it:\n\u201cBy pressing the detonator, you can immediately open\nthe door to Paradise \u2013 it is the shortest path to Heaven\u201d\n(Hassan 2001).\n4. Meaning, morality and the afterlife\nSome say that we shall never know and that to the gods we are\nlike flies that the boys kill on a summer day, and some say, on\nthe contrary, that the very sparrows do not lose a feather that\nhas not been brushed away by the finger of God.\n\u2014Thornton Wilder, The Bridge of San Luis Rey\nBecause the adjudication of an afterlife of eternal reward\nor damnation is seen as superseding \u201cmere\u201d human auth-\nority, people\u2019s understanding of the origins of moral deon-\ntology \u2013 what one ought and ought not to do in\nlife \u2013 shows a strong cognitive bias toward belief in a\nsupernatural creator of human morality (rather than, for\ninstance, a bias toward belief in design by nature or\nhuman whim). Reincarnation beliefs that rely on karmic\nprinciples are no exception because such principles\nrequire an intelligent designer of this morality-based\nrebirthing cycle. This overall vein of reasoning helps to\nexplain why people expect divine retribution for moral\ntransgressions only, rather than, say, for breaches of\nsocial etiquette (e.g., Roes & Raymond 2003). As Camus\n(1943\/1991) writes, \u201crevolt against men is also directed\nagainst God\u201d (p. 94). From a genetic fitness perspective,\nwhat is important is that it is moral transgression that\nscars reputation most deeply and has the most costly\neffect on future social relations (Goffman 1963) and there-\nfore behavioral compliance in this domain is critically\nimportant.\nSurprisingly, cognitive scientists who study religion have\ngiven the topic of morality relatively short shrift. For\nexample, Atran and Norenzayan (2004) recently argued\nthat culturally acquired supernatural concepts (cf. Boyer\n2001) receive emotional staying power because they are\nlent support by an evolved hyperactive agency detection\ndevice (see also Atran 2002; Barrett 2000; Guthrie 1993).\nAccording to Atran and Norenzayan, this mechanism\nserves the protective function of hyper-vigilance in poten-\ntially dangerous environments, but as a consequence,\naffectively primes individuals and causes them to over-\nattribute intentions to the natural world, such as might\nhappen when a branch falls in the forest. The authors\nconclude that \u201csupernatural agents are readily conjured\nup because natural selection has trip-wired cognitive\nschema for agency detection in the face of uncertainty\u201d\n(Atran & Norenzayan 2004, p. 720). In particular, superna-\ntural attributions occur because environmental stimuli\n\u201cachieve the minimal threshold for triggering hyper-\nactive facial-recognition and body-movement recognition\nschemata that humans possess\u201d (p. 720).\nAtran draws on findings from developmental psychology\nshowing that agency overgeneralization is an innate\nBering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 459\nfeature of human cognition. For instance, in a variety of\ncontrolled experiments using nonverbal measures,\nCsibra and his colleagues have demonstrated that, if\ncausal cues indicating rational agency are present, even\ninfants see inanimate movement as purposive behavior\n(e.g., 12-month-olds ascribed intentions to dots on a\ncomputer screen moving about in a \u201crational\u201d manner;\nsee Gergely & Csibra 2003).\nDespite minor theoretical differences with Boyer\u2019s evol-\nutionary model of religion, Atran (2002) is united with\nBoyer and other cultural epidemiologists in denying that\nreligion is an adaptation. However, although the explana-\ntory utility of cultural epidemiology theory has been unri-\nvaled among recent attempts to explain the evolutionary\nbasis of religion, it has problems of its own. By focusing\non the role of concept acquisition, this work may be\novershadowing more fundamental questions about the\nnatural foundations of religion \u2013 questions raised in\nsection 3 (Souls and intelligent design). For example,\nAtran and Norenzayan\u2019s (2004) model fails to account\nfor people\u2019s tendency to assume that supernatural agents\nare responsible for traumatic life events (Deridder et al.\n1999; McAdams 2001; Pepitone & Saffioti 1997; Weeks &\nLupfer 2000). How can reasoning about the supernatural\ncauses of, say, suffering a miscarriage, being felled by\ndisease, or losing a loved one in an accident be triggered\nby facial-recognition and body-movement recognition\nschemata? There are no such environmental cues\ncapable of breaking the \u201chair trigger\u201d of the authors\u2019\nproposed sensory driven hyperactive agency detector, yet\nsupernatural attribution occurs (arguably even more so\nthan for the exemplar hair-trigger cases).\nAnother approach to solving the riddle of religion is to\naddress whether the self\u2019s view that it is something more\nthan a material body subject to the mindless and amoral\nlaws of nature is a product of natural selection (Dennett\n1991; 1995). Evolutionary scholars in this area might\nthen begin to shift the primary theoretical frame from\none that centers on concept acquisition and agency detec-\ntion to one that centers on models of self representation,\nmorality, and meaning (Bering 2002b; 2003b). Although\nthese approaches likely reflect complementary levels of\nanalysis rather than alternative theoretical models, the\ncultural epidemiology approach has, to date, not success-\nfully bridged the representation of supernatural concepts\nwith the Darwinian currency of behavior. What is required\nto bridge this gap is the self, a conspicuously absent entity\nin the cognitive science of religion.\n4.1. \u201cSigns\u201d: Ascribing meaning to natural events\nThe intentional stance is the strategy of interpreting the beha-\nvior of an entity (person, animal, artifact, whatever) by treating\nit as if it were a rational agent who governed its \u201cchoice\u201d of\n\u201caction\u201d by a \u201cconsideration\u201d of its \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201cdesir-\nes\u201d . . . the basic strategy of the intentional stance is to treat\nthe entity in question as an agent, in order to predict \u2013and\nthereby explain, in one sense \u2013 its actions or moves.\n\u2014Daniel Dennett (1996), Kinds of Minds\nIf people naturally endow the events of their lives with a\nhidden purpose, the self may then hold expectations\nabout the \u201cbehaviors\u201d of supernatural causal agents,\ncanonical expectations that conform to standard rules of\nfairness and justice. Research on just-world beliefs\nshows that people indeed operate under the assumption\nthat others \u201cget what they deserve,\u201d especially when they\nhave little control over negative outcomes and when\nhelp cannot be meted out to unfortunate innocents (for\na recent review of this literature, see Hafer & Be`gue\n2005). Although just-world researchers have not generally\nsought to interpret related religious notions, often implicit\nin this type of causal reasoning about fortune and misfor-\ntune is the idea that some behavior in the moral domain is\nconnected to an unrelated, uncontrollable life event.\nTherefore, a central question is \u201cwho\u201d is represented as\ntallying up our deeds and as meting out just deserts in\nthe form of positive and negative life events (in whatever\nontological domain these happen to be administered).\nBruner (1990) has argued that, in everyday social\npsychology, individuals will search for meaning whenever\nothers\u2019 behaviors violate their expectations, or otherwise\nfail to adhere to sociocultural scripts. For example,\nsubtle breaches of conversational maxims, such as non\nsequiturs or other types of \u201cconversational implicatures,\u201d\nwill often encourage a search of the partner\u2019s intentions\n(see also Baldwin & Moses 1996; Baron-Cohen et al.\n1997). Whenever unexpected autobiographical events\noccur, individuals may similarly seek to identify the inten-\ntions of the supernatural agent who has caused these\nevents (or at least allowed them to happen), because this\nis presumably a purposeful agent who adheres to unwrit-\nten rules of social reciprocity (Bering 2003b). In Nazi\nGermany, for instance, some Holocaust survivors report-\nedly thought that God had gone insane, since clearly he\nhad breached the most basic of social agreements with\nhis followers (see Wiesel 1961).3\nThis belief in a just world is so strong, in fact, that among\nmany groups personal calamities and hardships are taken\nas evidence that the individual must have done something\nhorribly wrong. Often the only suitable remedy for these\nhardships is spiritual excision by way of public confession.\nAmong the Igbo of Nigeria, for example:\n[a]dultery by a wife is regarded as bringing supernatural pun-\nishment upon herself and her husband . . . thus if a woman\nexperiences difficult labor, it is assumed that she has com-\nmitted adultery and she is asked to give the name of her\nlover in order that the child be born. If a man falls sick, his\nwife may be questioned as to whether she has committed\nadultery. (Ottenberg 1958\/1980, p. 124)\nThere may also be \u201cnonreligious\u201d developmental pre-\ncursors to this moralistic interpretation of uncontrollable\nnegative events. Piaget (1932\/1965) argued that young\nchildren evidence a belief in immanent justice in which\n\u201cthe child must affirm the existence of automatic punish-\nments which emanate from things themselves\u201d (p. 251).\nThus, in a classic study, Piaget (1932\/1965) presented\nchildren aged 6\u201312 years with the story of a child who\nsteals or disobeys and then, upon crossing a bridge, falls\ninto the water when the bridge collapses. Nearly all\n(86%) of the youngest children in the study reasoned\nthat the accident would never have happened were it\nnot for the character\u2019s earlier misdeeds.4\nIndeed, people who have violated some moral rule often\nappear expectant of existential punishment, and those\nguilty parties who find themselves untarnished by their\nwrongdoing may feel as though their current happiness\nis undeserved. This is another common theme in\nBering: The folk psychology of souls\n460 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nliterature, exemplified by the works of Victor Hugo (e.g.,\nLes Miserables) and Fyodor Dostoyevsky (e.g., The Broth-\ners Karamazov, Crime and Punishment). Landman (2001),\na narrative psychologist, tells the true story of a fugitive\nwho drove the getaway car in a heist that left a security\nguard dead. Decades later, this woman \u201cobsessed with a\ndesire to be punished, to seek expiation\u201d (Franks 1994,\np. 54) turned herself in to clueless authorities. Asked\nwhy she confessed, the now model citizen told her\nlawyer that \u201cmy strongest weapon against suicide is my\ncontract with God . . .\u201d (Franks 1994, p. 42).\nIn many societies, not only is supernatural punishment\nenvisioned to fall directly upon the heads of the wicked,\nbut is also believed to be sanguineous. Some supernatural\nagents are seen as unforgiving and merciless, inflicting\nlasting and far-reaching punishments across generations\n(Bering & Johnson 2005). Perhaps the worst punishment\nof all would be for one\u2019s biological relatives, especially\noffspring, to be cursed for the self\u2019s misdeeds. This is a\nparticularly recurrent theme and is illustrated very\nclearly in the following brief passage on the Pagai from a\nDutch missionary publication:\nA missionary once acted emphatically against various [supersti-\ntious] prohibitions in order to demonstrate their inefficacy.\nActually this made a totally wrong impression on the people\nbecause they said: \u201cThe man knows perfectly well that he\nhimself won\u2019t be punished but that the punishment will fall\non his children.\u201d (Anonymous 1939, p. 9)\nRecent laboratory findings suggest that there may be\nidentifiable cognitive developmental milestones that\npromote the pan-cultural human tendency to see \u201csigns\u201d\nor hidden messages in natural events. In a study by\nBering and Parker (in press), 3- to 9-year-old children\nwere informed that an invisible agent (Princess Alice)\nwould help them play a forced-choice game by \u201ctelling\nthem, somehow, when they chose the wrong box,\u201d\nwhereas a matched control group of children were not\ngiven this supernatural prime. On two unexpected event\ntrials, as soon as the child chose a box, an experimenter\ntriggered a simulated unexpected event in the laboratory\n(i.e., a light turning on\/off; a picture falling), and chil-\ndren\u2019s response to these events (i.e., moving their hand\nto the opposite box) was coded. Thus, the study sought\nto determine the age at which children first begin to\nview natural events as being about their behaviors and as\nstemming from the mind of a communicative supernatural\nagent.\nResults showed a significant interaction of age group by\nexperimental condition. The only children to reliably move\ntheir hand to the opposite box in response to the unex-\npected events were the oldest children (M \u00bc 7 years, 4\nmonths) who were primed with the invisible agent\nconcept. Whereas 82% of these oldest children assigned\nto the experimental condition (and therefore told about\nPrincess Alice) changed their response, only 18% of\nsame-aged children in the control group (who were not\ntold about Princess Alice) moved their hand to the oppo-\nsite box after the unexpected event. For children\u2019s post-\ntest verbal explanations, also, only the oldest children\nfrom the experimental group saw the unexpected events\nas being referential and declarative (e.g., \u201cPrincess Alice\ndid it because I chose the wrong box\u201d). In contrast,\nyounger children (M \u00bc 5 years, 6 months) saw the event\nas being intentionally caused by the invisible agent\n(e.g., \u201cPrincess Alice did it because she wanted to\u201d),\nwhereas the preschoolers (M \u00bc 4 years, 1 month) did\nnot invoke the invisible agent at all, but only physical\ncauses for the event (e.g., \u201cThe picture fell because it\nwasn\u2019t sticking very well\u201d).\nAlthough the cause of these age differences is contro-\nversial, these findings nevertheless demonstrate that the\ntendency to over-attribute intentions to the natural\nworld is not simply a matter of hyperactive agency detec-\ntion (e.g., Atran 2002; Atran & Norenzayan 2004; Barrett\n2000; Guthrie 1993), but rather it also involves, at least\nin older children and adults, making inferences of\ncommunicative meaning within a social context. In this\ncase, the specific supernatural agent concept (Princess\nAlice), which may be a rough analogue of culturally\nspecific supernatural agents, appeared to map onto this\ninferential capacity for seeing signs in natural events.\nFurthermore, these subjective inferences gave way to\nobjective behaviors, which is the primary currency of\nnatural selection. An event such as a picture falling to\nthe ground is not, in itself, a communicative event; it can\nbecome so only through the phenomenal properties of\nthe child\u2019s mind (\u201cwhat is the meaning of the picture\ncrashing to the floor, precisely at this moment in time?\u201d).\n5. Conclusion\nIn reviewing the available \u2013 though still very limited \u2013\nevidence, there are good conceptual grounds to argue\nthat natural selection may have set to work on specific\nhuman cognitive errors. These include simulation con-\nstraints leading to Type I errors in reasoning about the\nafterlife, teleo-functional errors leading to belief in the\nsoul\u2019s intelligent design, and theory of mind errors foster-\ning a belief that natural events were intentionally caused\nby supernatural agents. The resultant cognitive system\ncreated the functional illusion that the social behaviors\nof the self \u201cmattered\u201d outside of human relations. As a con-\nsequence it became morally tamed under the auspices of\nthis existential rubric and therefore was less likely to\nengage in acts that, if publicly exposed and harmful to\none\u2019s social reputation, seriously impaired genetic fitness.\nThe present article has also served to lay out some\ngeneral future directions for investigators to more\nprecisely explore the Darwinian mechanisms at the heart\nof the existential system outlined here. Such work can\nfurther reveal how the standard architecture of ancestral\nhuman minds was co-opted by natural selection to create\nthe functional illusion of an intelligently designed, immor-\ntal soul that was under nearly unbreakable moralistic\ncontract with the natural world.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI am grateful to the following individuals for their careful reading\nand comments on earlier versions of this article: Joseph Bulbulia,\nDominic Johnson, Shaun Nichols, Harvey Whitehouse, Nicholas\nHumphrey, and Paul Bloom.

This is as in various physical resurrectionist beliefs, such as\nthe Anabaptist doctrine of \u201csoul-sleep,\u201d in which the soul is said\nto hibernate, or lie in wait, until it may reanimate the physically\nreconstituted body.\n2. The simulation constraint hypothesis is indirectly sup-\nported by recent findings of egocentric social cognitive biases\nin adults (Epley et al. 2004). Epley and his colleagues found\nthat participants\u2019 eye gaze preferentially moved to privileged\nvisual space in response to an experimenter\u2019s ambiguous referen-\ntial communication. For example, the command \u201cmove the\nbunny\u201d elicited automatic eye gaze toward a stuffed bunny that\ncould be seen by the participant, but which was occluded from\nthe experimenter\u2019s perspective, over a chocolate Easter bunny\nto which both the participant and experimenter had visual\naccess. The authors argue that these findings show that egocentr-\nism is just as prevalent in adults as it is in young children. Adults,\nhowever, more rapidly correct their egocentrism to adjust for\nothers\u2019 limited knowledge (e.g., by quickly shifting their gaze\nand moving the chocolate Easter bunny). If, as Epley et al.\n(2004) reason, individuals do become better with experience at\nmaking adjustments to correct for their initial egocentric views,\nbut then rely on simulation to revise their social attributions,\nthen even the best perspective-taking skills should falter when\nit comes to reasoning about dead agents\u2019 \u201cperspective-less\u201d\nminds. This is because any attempt at correcting for egocentrism\nby using simulation would still run up against simulation\nconstraints (e.g., \u201cdoes he know that he\u2019s dead?\u201d) and generate\nattributions of continued psychological functioning. Indeed,\nthis is what is generally found.\n3. The atrocities of the Holocaust forced many survivors to\nquestion God\u2019s \u201cbenevolent\u201d intentions, apparently prompting\nsome Jews to revise their theological views to accommodate the\npossibility that God is in fact morally corrupt. Nowhere is this\ntheme more salient than in the semi-autobiographical chronicles\nof Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. In Gates of the Forest, Wiesel\n(1966, p. 197) writes:\nIn a concentration camp, one evening after work, a rabbi called\ntogether three of his colleagues and convoked a special court. Standing\nwith his head held high before them, he spoke as follows: \u201cI intend to\nconvict God of murder, for he is destroying his people and the law he\ngave to them . . . I have irrefutable proof in my hands. Judge without\nfear or sorrow or prejudice. Whatever you have to lose has long since\nbeen taken away.\u201d The trial proceeded in due legal form, with wit-\nnesses for both sides with pleas and deliberations. The unanimous\nverdict: \u201cGuilty.\u201d . . . [But] after all, He had the last word. On the day\nof the trial, He turned the sentence against his judges and accusers.\nThey, too, were taken off to the slaughter. And I tell you this: if their\ndeath has no meaning, then it\u2019s an insult, and if it does have a\nmeaning, it\u2019s even more so.\n4. In his Bridge of San Luis Rey (1927\/1955), Thornton\nWilder fictionalizes the sad tale of a collapsed bridge in eight-\neenth century Peru that brought five travelers to their deaths\nin the abyss below. In two chapters, one titled \u201cPerhaps an Acci-\ndent\u201d and the other titled \u201cPerhaps an Intention,\u201d Wilder\ndescribes how the resident monk, Brother Juniper, troubled by\nthe seeming arbitrariness of this horrific event, embarks on a\n\u201cscientific experiment\u201d to reveal why God chose to end the\nlives of these five people rather than some other five, by collecting\nand analyzing the facts and details of each person\u2019s value in terms\nof goodness, piety, and usefulness. Alas, \u201cthe thing was more dif-\nficult than he had foreseen\u201d and his quest for spiritual under-\nstanding went unresolved. In a case of life imitating art, 14\npeople lost their lives in 2001 when a runaway tugboat rammed\ntwo barges into an interstate bridge and caused about a dozen\ncars to collapse into the Arkansas River. One of the victims was\na young army captain and father of four from California on his\nway home to Virginia. The Oklahoman newspaper reported\nthat his commanding officer, echoing the thoughts of Brother\nJuniper, \u201cpondered the odds of making a 2,929-mile drive and\nlanding on a 500-foot stretch of bridge that, in the most bizarre\nof accidents, plummeted precisely as he crossed it. \u2018If [he] just\nstopped at a rest stop or stopped to get gas . . . There\u2019s just so\nmany variables\u2014and the timing.\u2019\u201d (Owen 2002).\nOpen Peer Commentary\nSimulation constraints, afterlife beliefs,\nand common-sense dualism\nMichael V. Antony\nDepartment of Philosophy, University of Haifa, Haifa 31905, Israel.\nantony@research.haifa.ac.il\nhttp:\/\/philo.haifa.ac.il\/faculty_pages\/antony.htm\nAbstract: Simulation constraints cannot help in explaining afterlife\nbeliefs in general because belief in an afterlife is a precondition for\nrunning a simulation. Instead, an explanation may be found by\nexamining more deeply our common-sense dualistic conception of the\nmind or soul.\nEarly on in his stimulating target article, Bering notes that the\nability to conceive of an afterlife requires a dualistic conception\nof the relation between the conscious mind or soul and the\nbody; and he is sympathetic (as I am also) to the idea that our\ncommon-sense concept of the mind\/soul is dualistic, and in all\nlikelihood innate. An important question for Bering is\n\u201chow . . . we get from the common-sense dualism of infants to\nbeliefs of the afterlife [ . . . ]\u201d (target article, sect. 1, para. 4).\nAnd a major part of his answer is given by his \u201csimulation con-\nstraint hypothesis,\u201d the idea that afterlife beliefs are explained\nby our attempts to mentally simulate \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to be dead\u201d:\nputting ourselves \u201cinto the shoes\u201d of dead agents, we are\ncompelled to ascribe to them mental states.\nWhile simulation constraints may help explain the specific\ntypes of mental states we project into the afterlife (as Bering\nargues), I do not think they can help explain why people\nbelieve in an afterlife in the first place. The point of a mental\nsimulation, after all, is to generate conclusions about an agent\u2019s\nmental states or behaviors (with the type of simulation run\ndepending on the types of mental states or behaviors about\nwhich one wishes to derive information). The cognitive mechan-\nisms involved in planning simulations, accordingly, must assume\nthe existence of a mind \u2013 namely, that mind into the nature of\nwhich one aims to gain insight through simulation. But this\nmust hold for the afterlife case too: prior to simulating a dead\nagent\u2019s mind, it must be assumed there is a mind to simulate.\nBut that already is to assume an afterlife. This mind\/soul may\nbe taken to be phenomenally rich, or relatively barren (experien-\ncing \u201cdarkness,\u201d \u201cnothingness,\u201d or what have you), but it must be\ntaken to exist, at least implicitly. Notice that Bering seems to\ngrant this in referring to \u201csimulation strategies to derive infor-\nmation about the minds of dead agents\u201d (sect. 2.1, para. 1,\nemphasis mine). It follows that nothing about a simulation\nitself can explain our belief in an afterlife, since some such\nbelief or assumption is a precondition for the planning and\nrunning of any such simulation.\nIf that is right, how might afterlife beliefs be explained? I\nbelieve that the route from our common-sense dualism to\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n462 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nafterlife beliefs is considerably shorter than Bering supposes.\nAfterlife beliefs may fall out quite directly from how our\ncommon-sense dualism is conceived. It may follow from our\ndualism that the destruction of a person\u2019s body has no bearing\nwhatsoever on the existence of his or her mind\/soul \u2013 much as\nit is entailed by my common-sense conception of the apple and\norange in my refrigerator that eating the apple will leave the\norange intact. Most of the work in explaining afterlife beliefs\non this view, therefore, will be done by a detailed account of\nour concepts of our body, mind\/soul, and their interrelations\n(and how the question of an afterlife arises).\nRegardless of the extent of the gap between our common-sense\ndualism and afterlife beliefs, discovering how one gets from the\nformer to the latter will require a detailed characterization of our\ndualist conception, something we currently lack. We would thus\ndo well to examine the features of our conception of the mind\/\nsoul that are implicated in our conceiving the mind and body as\ndistinct. It will not do simply to say that we conceive of the body\nand soul as ontologically distinct, and leave it at that, because we\nmust understand the particular type of distinctness involved, and\nhow it is grounded in the concepts of body and soul. (Objects\nand events are also ontologically distinct categories, but are inter-\ndependent in ways that bodies and souls are not.) We should\nexamine our conceptions of ourselves as conscious beings, selves,\nexperiencers, and \u201cwitnesses\u201d; of the mind\/soul as being essentially\nprivate, \u201cinternal,\u201d subjective, or phenomenal. For it is something\nabout these conceptions, arguably, that makes the mind\/soul seem\nso utterly unlike anything physical, that destroying the body can\nleave the mind\/soul intact.\nOne way to tap children\u2019s understanding of the privacy and\n\u201cinnerness\u201d of conscious phenomena is to explore children\u2019s\nunderstanding of dreams, imagery, and sensations, conceived\nof as private and \u201cinternal.\u201d I shall hint at some possible direc-\ntions for research, with a few anecdotes. (Since I am not a\npsychologist, they should be taken with a grain of salt; with that\nsaid, their purpose is merely to illustrate some questions for\ninvestigation.) At age three, my daughter appeared to understand\nthe idea that dreams involve \u201cpictures in her head,\u201d and seemed\nable to sing her favorite song \u201cin her head\u201d and report when she\nhad finished. She insisted that others could not see the pictures\nor hear the sounds \u201cbecause they were hers,\u201d and found the sug-\ngestion that others might see them or hear them silly. (Interest-\ningly, she also insisted that she did not see the pictures in her\nhead; they were just there.) This conception of privacy also\napplied to sensations like pain. Also at age three, she went\nthrough a brief stage of lying about having hurt herself (for\nsympathy, hugs, etc.) when noticing her baby sister receiving\nattention. That she confidently lied about feeling pain in the\npresence of others suggests she believed her sensations were\naccessible only to herself.\nAnother matter to explore is children\u2019s capacity to conceive of\nobjects, properties, and events in their experience as merely\nphenomenal. I have in mind the capacity to grasp that what\nappears in dreams is \u201cnot real,\u201d as well as grasping the concepts\nof hallucination (including radical hallucination, as in \u201cThe\nMatrix\u201d), illusion, after-images, and the appearance\u2013reality\ndistinction more generally. One way to get at some of these\nissues may be to probe children\u2019s understanding of \u201cinverted\nqualia,\u201d the idea that what you visually experience when looking\nat objects we both call \u201cblue,\u201d for example, might be qualitatively\nvery different from what I experience when looking at those\nobjects. This idea can be explored intrasubjectively by adapting\none of a child\u2019s eyes to bright light, and then having the child\nlook at a uniformly colored object one eye at a time. The\nobject\u2019s color will appear to alternate between two different\nshades. Assuming the child does not infer that he or she is causally\naffecting the object by blinking, some understanding of the\nconcept of phenomenal color might be expected to reveal itself.\nConceptual abilities of these sorts enable Descartes to doubt\naway the physical world while his mind\/soul (plus phenomenology)\nremains. This is a first step in Descartes\u2019 argument for dualism.\nHowever, it is also already very close to the idea of an afterlife,\nsince it is the idea of a mind\/soul existing without the physical\nworld. This too suggests that the distance from our common-\nsense dualism to afterlife beliefs may be short, at least if our\ncommon-sense dualism is Cartesian in relevant respects.\nSocial cognition of religion1\nWilliam Sims Bainbridge\nDivision of Information and Intelligent Systems, National Science Foundation,\nArlington, VA 22230.\nwbainbri@nsf.gov http:\/\/mysite.verizon.net\/wsbainbridge\nAbstract: Research on religion can advance understanding of social\ncognition by building connections to sociology, a field in which much\ncognitively oriented work has been done. Among the schools of\nsociological thought that address religious cognition are: structural\nfunctionalism, symbolic interactionism, conflict theory, phenomenology,\nand, most recently, exchange theory. The gulf between sociology and\ncognitive science is an unfortunate historical accident.\nBering is entirely correct that religious beliefs can help us under-\nstand the evolution of human social cognition, but I would go\nfurther to say that research on religious cognition could\nbecome the first span of a substantial bridge between the cogni-\ntive and the social sciences. Broad territories in my own field,\nsociology, are cognitive in nature, and I would venture to say\nthat the largest troves of systematic data relevant to religious\ncognition have been collected by sociologists. Some of these\ndata are freely available, such as the General Social Survey\n(sda.berkeley.edu) or the many questionnaire datasets at The\nAssociation of Religion Data Archives (www.thearda.com).\nOne function of Bering\u2019s article is to alert readers to the\nimpressive group of cognitive or developmental psychologists\nand cultural anthropologists who have done so much good\nwork on religious cognition over the past decade. This group,\nhowever, has ignored vast bodies of relevant social science litera-\nture, probably for two reasons. First, any new school of thought\nneeds to mature in intellectual isolation, until its ideas are suffi-\nciently well developed to stand critical scrutiny. We can call\nthis the allopatric principle of cultural innovation, by analogy\nwith allopatric speciation in biology: New cultural movements\ndevelop more readily under conditions of social isolation from\nexisting movements.\nSecond, sociology, political science, to some extent economics,\nand even important portions of social psychology remained aloof\nthirty years ago when the multidisciplinary field of cognitive\nscience was being formed. This tragedy was largely the result\nof misunderstandings and prejudices, augmented by turf\ndefense and an unwillingness to do the hard work required to\nbring the disciplines together. Major schools of thought in socio-\nlogy \u2013 structural functionalism (Parsons et al. 1951) and sym-\nbolic interactionism (Blumer 1969) \u2013 were predominantly\ncognitive, emphasizing concepts such as overarching values,\nsocial roles, group identity, and definitions of the situation. But\nthese approaches made little use of rigorous statistical method-\nologies, and thus may not have seemed \u201cscientific\u201d enough to\nbe included in cognitive science. For all its emphasis on ideology,\nthe Marxist movement that was so influential in sociology claimed\nto be materialist, an example of false consciousness if ever there\nwas one. However, Marxism informed conflict theory, and a cog-\nnitive scientist can draw from that broader tradition an awareness\nthat sometimes language and even cognition itself may be moves\nin a game of social power (Habermas 1971).\nA psychologist seeking cognitive research in sociology might\nfind it in unexpected places. Cognitive scientists tend to\ndissociate themselves from behaviorism, which in psychology\ndisparaged speculations about internal mental states. However,\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 463\nin sociology behaviorism was remarkably cognitive in nature, as\nillustrated by the extended analysis of the exchange of advice\nfor approval in Social Behavior by George C. Homans (1974).\nInfluenced by Homans, later sociologists developed the exchange\ntheory or rational choice explanation of religion: Humans seek\nmany rewards that are not available, following cognitive expla-\nnations that become progressively supernatural in nature as the\nhumans continually fail to attain the deeply desired reward. If\nthe recent cognitive theories of religion lack an essential ingredi-\nent, it is the motivation that drives people to act upon religious\ncognitions, and to build complex and costly religious institutions.\nSociological exchange theory often makes use of artificial intelli-\ngence computer simulation. This methodology has been applied\nprofitably to religion, and one direct reinforcement neural net\nprogram showed that deprivation can cause an agent to\ndevelop minimally counterintuitive beliefs (Bainbridge 2006).\nPhenomenological sociology and its cousin ethnomethodology\nare among the least rigorous approaches, but they still may have\nsomething to contribute. Bering\u2019s reports about how people\nconceptualize death are reminiscent of the insightful early work\nby theorist Alfred Schutz about the phenomenology of time.\nSchutz is especially famous for his work on multiple realities,\nwhich can be distinguished because their subjective flow of time\nis different, and religious experiences are a case in point (Schutz\n1971). Less well known is his theory that humans conceptualize\nthe future as a kind of past, seen as if it had already occurred\n(Schutz 1967), a contradiction not unlike that when people con-\nceptualize a dead person: Dead is to alive as future is to past.\nPotentially relevant empirical research in sociology is of many\nkinds, including historical accounts of the thoughts of religious\nleaders, ethnographies of religious movements, and a very well\ndeveloped tradition of questionnaire research. Bering discusses\nsuicide, and official statistics have been analyzed in ways relevant\nto cognition, suggesting that the power of faith to deter suicide is\ndeclining in advanced societies (Bainbridge, in press). Given\nBering\u2019s emphasis on death, it is worth noting that the General\nSocial Survey contains several questions about how people con-\nceptualize the afterlife, and that the same questions have been\nadministered to members of radical religious groups, allowing\ncomparisons of such beliefs as how erotic the afterlife is\n(Bainbridge 2002).\nBering talks about morality, but does not introduce the\nextensive quantitative research on how religious faith does or\ndoes not shape behavior. Especially relevant is the research on\njuvenile delinquency. Consider the phenomenon I call the\nStark effect, because Rodney Stark discovered it: \u201cReligious indi-\nviduals will be less likely than those who are not religious to\ncommit delinquent acts, but only in communities where the\nmajority of people are actively religious\u201d (Stark 1996, p. 164).\nThat is, in primarily secular communities, adolescents who\nbelieve in supernatural sanctions for misbehavior are just as\nlikely as their irreligious peers to steal or vandalize property. In\ncommunities where the majority of adolescents are religious,\nthe beliefs of the individual child are indeed predictive. Thus,\ncognition alone may not deter antisocial behavior.\nA further complication is that many studies show that the\nStark effect does not apply to hedonistic behaviors, and religious\nadolescents are less likely to use drugs or engage in sexual\nexperimentation even in very secular areas. Perhaps religion\nserves an advisory function, helping to guide the adolescent\u2019s\ncognitive deliberations away from danger (Bainbridge 1992).\nThis research area is still unsettled, and studies by cognitive\nscientists would be especially welcome.\nNOTE\n1.

The same early experiences\nput us at the center of a moral universe, but there is no necessary\nconnection between the two processes. We do not need disgruntled\nancestors to make us behave; disgruntled parents will do.\n\u201cWhat came into existence beside the dead body of the loved one\nwas not only the doctrine of the soul, the belief in immortality\nand a powerful source of man\u2019s sense of guilt, but also the earliest\nethical commandments\u201d (Freud 1915, p. 295). Bering, like\nFreud, ties religion to death and morality, and makes the startling\ntheoretical claim that we should regard religion as an evolution-\nary adaptation, because it supports viewing the self as a moral\nagent. The universal tendency to tie misfortune (and blessings)\nto supernatural agents buttresses group cooperation and thus\nhas great evolutionary value. One problem with this notion is\ntheoretical, and has to do with cooperation and reputation\neffects. According to Ohtsuki et al. (2006), cooperation is a fun-\ndamental aspect of all biological systems, and among humans it\ncan evolve even in the absence of reputation effects, but\nHenrich (2006), points out that the reputation effect may act to\nstabilize maladaptive and immoral behaviors.\nAccounting for the parallel development of morality and\nreligion should involve both panhuman experiences and innate\ntendencies. Both innate architecture and panhuman socialization\nprocesses lead to the universal perception of the self as moral\nagent. Evolved architecture leads, indeed, to an innate readiness\nto over-detect causality and intentionality. The three kinds of\nbehavior described here \u2013 supernatural agents, ghosts, and\nmagical thinking (\u201cPrincess Alice\u201d) \u2013 can all be accounted for\nby the general hyperactive agency detection mechanism, which\noperates to detect not just biological processes, or activity, but\nanother consciousness or another mind. The survival value of\ndetecting, and negotiating with other minds is so great that it\naccounts for this hyper-vigilance. Friend\u2013foe identification\nenables us to be cared for and then take care of others.\nOur early experience of our own consciousness and that of\nother conscious beings leads to our belief in the enormous\npower of the mind, our eternal soul. It was William James who\nalready stated: \u201cReligion, in fact, for the great majority of our\nown race, means immortality and nothing else\u201d (James 1902,\n1961, p. 406). Souls are important because they give us more\ninformation about promised immortality. The supernatural\npremise is fleshed out, so to speak, by enumerating the entities\nin the spirit world, most of whom must be human souls before\nbirth and after death.\nSome dead agents are psychologically important because we\nhave known them and interacted with them; they informally\njoin the pantheon outside the official hierarchy. The author\u2019s\nanalysis of the role of the souls of the ancestors ignores the fact\nthat dead ancestors were once live parents.\nOur innate architecture also produces egocentrism, attach-\nment-seeking, and the panhuman process of socialization. The\nhuman baby is hard-wired to seek a caretaker and find security\nas soon as it comes out of the womb (Bowlby 1973). The baby\u2019s\nhelplessness is matched by the caretaker\u2019s readiness to create it\nin her own image. Socialization of the young aims at impulse\ncontrol. They are asked to reduce their egocentrism and impul-\nsivity in return for parental love. Whatever we call morality is\ntied to powerful bonds developed between children and care-\ntakers. In all cultures, love is finite and conditional, and punish-\nments and the withdrawal of love are frequent and swift.\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n464 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nChildren are made into moral agents easily through\nsocialization and social control mechanisms, as they are assigned\nblame and learn to blame others and especially themselves. The\npanhuman experience is that parents are the carriers of morality,\nas they convey to their children a fantasy of a world ordered into\nright and wrong, reward and punishment. The moral universe we\nall inhabit was developed in early childhood in our private\nconsciousness, and it may be projected on the universe.\nDo we need religion to support behavioral inhibition, as\nBering claims? The basic pattern of socialization precedes the\nuse of religious ideation. We are afraid of mother and father\nbecause they punish us, long before they become the souls of\nthe ancestors. References to divine authority are sometimes\nused by parents to bolster their authority in disciplining children.\nThus, the parents become allied with divine authority. Examples\ncan be found in all cultures (Geertz 1960). Nunn (1964) found\nthat this \u201ccoalition\u201d with divinity was prevalent among parents\nwho were ineffectual and powerless.\nBering correctly points out that the connection between\nmorality and religion is rarely addressed in the behavioral litera-\nture. But this is true not only for cognitive science or psychology,\nbut also for history, anthropology, and sociology, and with good\nreason. Showing that religion has any consequences in prosocial\nbehavior has not been easy.\nThe four-dimensional model of religiosity (ideological, ritualis-\ntic, experiential, and intellectual) so often used, originally had a\nfifth dimension \u2013 the consequential \u2013 designed to measure the\neffects of religiosity on conduct in other spheres. It was\ndropped because consequences in nonreligious behavior could\nnot be found (Beit-Hallahmi & Argyle 1997). Modern findings\nindicate that religion does have a considerable effect on secular\nbehavior in two areas: sex and the use of illicit drugs. Generaliz-\ning beyond these specific areas has been difficult (Beit-Hallahmi\n& Argyle 1997). We should note that not only has the academic\nstudy of religion ignored morality, but the academic study of\nmoral development has largely ignored religion, with no apparent\ndamage or deficits.\nThe global secularization process means that we no longer\ninterpret misfortune as caused by supernatural agents. Some\nmisfortunes (earthquakes) result from inanimate natural forces,\nand are viewed as unrelated to any moral agents (Neiman\n2004). What can be morally condemned is human action. We\ncan condemn human cruelty, and we do. Moreover, the Enlight-\nenment has led to a new, totally secular, public discourse about\nmorality, focusing on justice, rights, equality, and human\nwelfare, and marginalizing the impulse control discourse. This\nsea change in our moral outlook is evident in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (1948) and in such secular\ngroups as Amnesty International and Medecins sans Frontie`res.\nLifelong atheists have been found to be well-socialized, law-\nabiding, and nonviolent (Beit-Hallahmi 2006). They obviously\ngo through blaming themselves, and others, and feel guilty.\nThey may anthropomorphize their diseases and inclement\nweather. They have have gotten all that from their evolved archi-\ntecture and early experience, without the help of any functional\nreligious illusions.\nReligion and morality: An anthropological\ncomment\nMaurice Bloch\nDepartment of Anthropology, London School of Economics, London, WC2\n2AE, United Kingdom; College de France, Chaire Europe\u00b4enne, 75724 Paris\nCedex 05, France.\nM.E.Bloch@lse.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.lse.ac.uk\/collections\/anthropology\/mauricebloch.htm\nAbstract: This commentary criticises Bering on two counts. First,\nbecause we do not know what he attributes to natural selection and\nwhat he sees as derived representations. Second, Bering\u2019s ethnography\nof religion is inadequate. People who practise ancestor worship are not\nconcerned with their own survival but with that of others. Many\nsupernatural beings are not thought of as morally motivated.\nJesse Bering\u2019s article is nothing if not ambitious. It starts with an\nexperiment showing that young children attributed psychological\nfunctions to a recently dead mouse and ends up with a proposal\nthat amounts to saying that religion, especially religion of a kind\nwhich is strikingly similar to what Harold Bloom has called\n\u201cAmerican Religion\u201d (Bloom 1992), is innate, since it is the\nproduct of natural selection. That is a long way to go, especially\nbecause, as far as I am aware, most religious systems are not\nmuch concerned with the survival of the souls of rodents.\nThe connecting links in the argument are that humans are natural\ndualists because they inevitably have a belief in the survival of some\nelements of agency on the part of the dead, who consequently are\nattributed with mental states; that this leads to similar beliefs\nabout other supernatural beings such as God; that the existence\nof supernatural agents give meaning to the individual self in the\nworld; that these beliefs make people behave morally; and that\nthis is good for them and their inclusive fitness because a reputation\nfor morality leads others to treat you and your offspring well.\nI react to this proposal in two ways: first, as a critic of the\ngeneral theoretical issues raised by Bering; second, as a\ntraditional anthropologist who wants to test the theory against\nthe ethnographic record.\nBering claims to give us an evolutionary account that, in certain\nrespects, is critical of theories such as those of Boyer, Sperber, and\nAtran because these seem to make religion the product of an\nunfortunate malfunction of our cognitive apparatus. This indeed\nseems odd for such a central feature of human culture, and I\ntoo have been critical of these writers for linked reasons (Bloch\n2002). Nonetheless, Boyer and those others seem to me to have\nan advantage over Bering in an important respect, that is, they\nare very clear as to what they are claiming. I do not find such\nclarity in Bering. Following such writers as Tooby and Cosmides,\nhe tells us that natural selection has led to the evolution of certain\nnecessarily innate characteristics, which, as dispositions, have\naffected the history of culture. Such a proposal requires a strict\ndivision between that which is claimed to be innate, the product\nof natural selection, and the cultural phenomena that have been\naffected by such innate dispositions \u2013 inevitably together with\nmany other factors. It is precisely this distinction between\nexactly what it is claimed natural selection has bred in us and\nthe derived factors that are affected by these inherited mechan-\nisms which is missing. Is it the morality\/religion complex that\nhas been selected for in the distant past of the species? Or is it\nmerely the belief in the survival of the dead? I am not sure. For\nexample, Bering tells us, inter alia, that \u201cpeople naturally endow\ntheir lives with a hidden purpose.\u201d What does \u201cnaturally\u201d mean\nhere? Does that mean that natural selection has made us into\nbeings that \u201cnaturally\u201d think in this way? Are we to understand\nthat certain other dispositions inevitably, but indirectly, lead us\nto see our lives in this way? I do not feel I know.\nNow let us turn to more ethnographic matters. At least two key\nelements in the argument are to me unacceptable. One concerns\nthe characterisation of ancestors, the other concerns the charac-\nterisation of supernatural beings in general.\nEven if we accept that it is frequent to believe in some aspect\nof the continuing functionality of the psyche of dead people, this\ndoes not mean that these are regularly represented as concerned\nwith morality. However, it is this involvement which, for Bering,\nwould explain the selective advantage of such a representation\nand therefore its frequent recurrence. For example, the Tro-\nbrianders famously described by Malinowski have elaborate\nbeliefs in various forms of life after death, but they do not\nbelieve for all that, that the dead enforce the morality of the\nliving (Malinowski 1916). There are many other examples of\nsuch moral indifference, as in the case of ancient Greece as\ndescribed in The Iliad. Even in Catholic Christianity dead souls\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 465\nof ordinary people are not concerned with the morality of their\ndescendents, and the early fathers of the church actually went\nout of their way to eradicate such \u201cpagan\u201d beliefs.\nThose people who do believe in ancestors as some sort of moral\npolice are also very different from what Bering seems to assume.\nSuch people are not concerned about what happens after their\nown death; what matters is what the souls of already dead\npeople might do to them if they are displeased. This makes\nBering\u2019s argument about the importance of the belief in\nintelligent design for one\u2019s own behaviour irrelevant. And, even\nthen, ancestors are rarely concerned with maintaining a universal\nmorality; they are concerned with punishing or rewarding actions\nwhich ensure their own selfish reproduction via their descen-\ndants. This interest in their own inclusive fitness is not particu-\nlarly altruistic and often overrides the interests of their own\ndescendants (Fortes 1959). The ethnographic record of beliefs\nin an afterlife therefore gives us a quite different picture to\nthat suggested in the target article.\nThis is equally true of Bering\u2019s characterisation of god-like super-\nnatural beings. The author seems to assume that supernaturals are\ninvariably on the side of good and against evil. This is to forget that\nsuch creatures as devils and witches are on the side of evil. Even\nmore commonly, supernaturals are represented as neither good\nnor evil, but as simply unconcerned with moral issues, though\ntheir very existence certainly is believed to cause trouble. This\nis the case, for example, of the nature spirits common in Africa,\nof the spirits of aborted foetuses in Japan, and of the ancestral\nspirits of Amerindians. Similarly, there are many cases of\nsupreme gods, such as the famous African otiose gods, who also\nare characterised by indifference and arbitrariness (Forde 1954).\nProsocial aspects of afterlife beliefs: Maybe\nanother by-product\nPascal Boyer\nDepartments of Psychology and Anthropology, Washington Unversity,\nSt. Louis, MO 63130.\npboyer@artsci.wustl.edu http:\/\/artsci.wustl.edu\/\u0002pboyer\nAbstract: Bering argues that belief in posthumous intentional agency\nmay confer added fitness via the inhibition of opportunistic behavior.\nThis is true only if these agents are interested parties in our moral\nchoices, a feature which does not result from Bering\u2019s imaginative\nconstraint hypothesis and extends to supernatural agents other than\ndead people\u2019s souls. A by-product model might handle this better.\nBering\u2019s brilliant unpacking and explanation of afterlife beliefs\nincludes the claim that a disposition to such cognitive errors\nmay confer greater fitness by motivating prosocial (and inhibiting\nopportunistic) behaviors (sect. 2.4). Indeed, in most cultures,\nbeliefs in dead agents are associated with moral feelings.\nHowever, the particular evolutionary argument offered here\nmay not be the most parsimonious account of the evidence,\nbecause (a) people associate morality with their supernatural\nbeliefs in many different ways, some of which do not mention\nafterlife beliefs; and (b) more important, there is massive\nevidence for these very same prosocial attitudes and inhibitions\noutside of supernatural beliefs.\nIn some cultures people construe morality in terms of a code\ngiven by the gods or a single god or ancestors or a specific cultural\nhero; in other cultural environments they express moral norms in\nterms of similarity to the behavior of paragons such as heroes or\ngods; in other places the norms derive from constant interaction\nwith spirits or gods or ancestors; and in many places people mix\nall three modes (Boyer 2001). This is a problem for Bering\u2019s\naccount. Such diversity suggests that the association between\nmorality and supernatural beliefs is rather ad hoc, perhaps best\nseen as a relevant, attention-grabbing and inferentially powerful\ncombination of prior elements that evolved for different reasons.\nIndeed, the evolution of prosocial behavior and moral feelings cer-\ntainly does not require supernatural beliefs. A whole suite of\nprosocial cognitive mechanisms evolved in human beings. They\ninclude for instance reputation-monitoring, whereby we construct\nprecise and dynamic databases about the reputational effects of\nown and others\u2019 actual behavior, as well as inferred dispositions\nand character (Wojciszke et al. 1998); commitment signals that\nevolved out of other forms of reliable, hard-to-fake signals and\nprovide information about likely future behavior (Nesse 2000); a\ncoalitional psychology that helps us maintain strong associations\nof non-kin and manage interaction with rival coalitions (Harcourt\n& de Waal 1992; Kurzban & Leary 2001); in-group strong recipro-\ncity whereby we suspend ordinary principles of exchange to create\na domain of valued and selfless interaction (Gintis 2000); ethnic\nsignals that help maintain the boundaries of this domain (Kuran\n1998); commitment gadgets that help us tie our own hands to\nforce ourselves to behave non-opportunistically (Schelling 1960);\nand moral feelings that provide immediate, negative emotional\nrewards for opportunistic plans and thereby compensate the moti-\nvational effects of the discount curve (Frank 1988). All these\ndispositions and processes evolved independently of supernatural\nand religious beliefs, operate in similar ways in people with or\nwithout such beliefs and regardless of differences in these\nbeliefs, and recruit different neuro-cognitive machinery from the\nsupernatural imagination (Boyer 2003b).\nSo we seem to have plausible hypotheses for the independent\ndevelopment, cognitive implementation, and evolutionary history\nof (a) beliefs in supernatural agents (including dead people) and\n(b) prosocial dispositions. This may help provide a parsimonious\n\u201cby-product\u201d explanation of morally relevant dead agents.\nIf we accept the first part of Bering\u2019s scenario, a set of cognitive\nconstraints lead us to construe dead people as intentional agents.\nThese constraints do not necessarily imply that the agents are\n\u201cinterested parties\u201d in our moral choices with \u201cfull-access\u201d to\nmorally relevant information about us (Boyer 2001). But all\nthat is required to entertain concepts of such full-access agents\nis an assumption that is already contained in many of our proso-\ncial cognitive mechanisms. The dispositions listed above all carry\nthe assumption that information about our own behavior is not\nsafely confined, that it may leak to other parties in unforeseen\nways, and that it is generally safe to assume in others more knowl-\nedge of our decisions than can be observed. This assumption\nitself is not terribly mysterious in origin. There is a cognitive\ncost in computing the extent to which others do not share infor-\nmation that is manifest to us, which is why understanding false\nbelief takes children more time than understanding belief, and\ncan be impaired by a variety of pathologies, as well as attentional\nload or altered states. So the assumption that others know what is\nmanifest to us is a default value of our intuitive psychology more\nthan a special elaboration of it.\nGiven all these elements, it would seem that the notion of \u201cfull-\naccess supernatural dead agents with moral interest\u201d develops\nwithout much cognitive effort, as it only combines prior assump-\ntions, and has great inferential potential. In particular, it provides\nan explanatory context in which one\u2019s own moral feelings, the\noutcome of implicit processes, may be readily explained. This\nby-product scenario seems more parsimonious than the one\noffered in the target article.\nThe principle of ontological commitment in\npre- and postmortem multiple agent tracking\nNicolas J. Bullot\nDepartment of Philosophy, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON L5L 1C6,\nCanada.\nnicolas@objectcognition.net\nhttp:\/\/www.nicolas-bullot.org\/Publi\/PubliFrame.html\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n466 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nAbstract: This commentary suggests that understanding the \u201cFolk\nPsychology of Souls\u201d requires studying a problem articulating ontology\nwith psychology: How do human beings, both as perceivers and\nthinkers, track and refer to (1) living and dead intentional agents and\n(2) supernatural agents? The problem is discussed in the light of the\nprinciple of the ontological commitment in agent tracking.\nJesse Bering\u2019s article addresses fascinating questions that\ncertainly deserve to be studied in an interdisciplinary science\nof the \u201cFolk Psychology of Souls\u201d (henceforth, FPS). Whereas\nthe author alludes to existentialist philosophy, he nonetheless\noverlooks research in contemporary analytic philosophy about\ntwo relevant themes: (1) the problem of reference (Campbell\n2002; Evans 1982; Kripke 1980; Perry 2001; Quine 1960;\nStrawson 1959) and (2) the problem of personal identity\n(Locke 1689\/1975; Merricks 2001; Olson 1997; Parfit 1984;\nRorty 1976; Shoemaker 1959). Understanding the FPS requires\nstudying this fundamental question: How do human beings,\nboth as perceivers and thinkers, track and refer to (1) living\nand dead intentional agents and (2) supernatural agents such\nas ghosts and gods? I name \u201ctracking\u201d the ability to trace,\nfollow up, or pursue over space and time a set of traceable\nindividuals; it is useful to distinguish perceptual tracking, in\nwhich a target individual is directly tracked by a sensory-motor\nsystem, from epistemic tracking, in which an individual is\nspatio-temporally pursued by indirect epistemic means such as\ncommunication and reasoning.\nIn several passages (e.g., about simulation, cognitive system),\nthe author seems to overlook the problem raised by the\nmultiplicity of skills and methods used by human beings to\ntrack (1) actual living and dead agents and (2) fictional mortal\nand immortal agents. An account of this multiplicity might\nthreaten the hypothesis that evolution has selected a unique\norganized cognitive system dedicated to forming illusory\nrepresentations of psychological immortality and supernatural\nagents. This multiplicity becomes apparent when one considers\nhow deeply the varied kinds of agent tracking depend upon the\nmultiple assumptions available about agents\u2019 (purported)\nontology. By \u201contology\u201d I mean an implicit representation or an\nexplicit understanding of the birth, persistence, and survival\nconditions of the tracked agent. Philosophers have distinguished\nbodily (Thomson 1997; Williams 1970) and biological criteria\n(Olson 1997) from psychological criteria (Parfit 1971; 1984;\nShoemaker 1959; 1999) capable of defining the survival of a\nperson, or intentional agent. As considered in the discussion of\nsortal concepts (Carey & Xu 2001; Hirsch 1982; Pylyshyn 2003;\nWiggins 1997; 2001), subjects or cognitive systems performing\ntracking must possess information about some uniquely\ndistinctive features of the tracked agent in order to direct their\nagent-tracking attitudes and actions appropriately. This can be\nexpressed by this Principle of the Ontological Commitment in\nAgent Tracking:\nThe skill or method that a human subject (or a perceptual,\ncognitive system) s uses to track a unique target intentional\nagent a are dependent upon the ontology that she (or it) ascribes\nimplicitly or explicitly to a. (Characters in italicized and bold\nfonts are standing for proper names.)\nThe author\u2019s hypothesis is that the ontological commitment\nabout the immortality of the soul of postmortem agents is the\n\u201cdefault cognitive stance\u201d selected by evolution. I would like to\nremark that even if the hypothesis were true, we would still\nhave to account for multiple ontological commitments in agent\ntracking and multiple manners of referring to afterlife agency.\nThis problem is relevant to the target article because it is some-\ntimes difficult to determine which kinds of agent-tracking beha-\nviors are discussed by the author. Do they involve behaviors and\nbeliefs relating to interactions with the tracked immortal soul?\nDo they involve beliefs about the possibility of localizing the\nsoul? What are the purported characteristics of individual souls\nthat guarantee their survival and traceability? What are the\nrelationships between visual tracking (Pylyshyn 1989; 2003)\nand living\/dead agent tracking (Bullot & Rysiew 2005)? Can\nthese relations be studied experimentally? Some of the previous\nquestions might have distinct answers in cultures that have\nevolved differently (Richerson & Boyd 2005) and are upholding\ndifferent ontological commitments.\nTo focus on a precise case: the author mentions the \u201ccontinued\nsocial relationships with the dead\u201d (sect. 2, para. 4). Such a phrase\nis ambiguous with regard to ontological commitment and track-\ning. If one accepts empirical realism, this continued social\nreference can be of at least two different types (see Fig. 1): (1)\nreference to, and physical interactions with, existing material\ntraces of a dead agent, or (2) reference to a fictional immortal\nsoul as in \u201ccommon-sense dualism\u201d (Bloom 2004). (This dichot-\nomy is reminiscent of the distinction between knowledge by\nacquaintance and by description; see Russell [1912; 1918;\n1956], Strawson [1959, pp. 18\u201320], Evans [1982, pp. 143\u2013\n203], Clark [2000, pp. 130\u201363] or Campbell [2002].) In type\n(1), the acquaintance- or empirically grounded reference,\nsubjects are referring either to an actual agent a or to the material\ntraces left by him. In type (2), the description- or fictionally\ngrounded reference, subjects are referring to a nonexisting fic-\ntional agent f such as Sherlock Holmes or a ghost. When facing\ntype (1), for example, if someone is heard having a discussion\nabout an individual named \u201ca,\u201d you can search for that particular\nindividual. In frequent cases, you may eventually find her and be\nin a situation to perceive a\u2019s organism and the surfaces\/move-\nments that convey information about a\u2019s mental states. Similarly\nto the case of other kinds of individuals (Campbell 2002;\nPylyshyn 2003), perceptually tracking of a\u2019s organism thus\nopens a wide range of epistemic possibilities, such as verifying\npropositions about a\u2019s current properties via, for example,\ndemonstrative identification, prosthetic perception, and bio-\nmetric measures. Even after a\u2019s death, it is usually still possible\nto trace and reach a\u2019s remains or possessions (think about arche-\nological investigations: a\u2019s corpse is marked with perceivable\ntraits or scars that are historical vestiges, which act as evidence\nof events in a\u2019s life). These epistemic actions are not available\nwith fictional reference, for the characteristics of a fictional\nagent can only be known by means of descriptions or imaginary\ndepictions. If f is a fictional character, any search of the referent\nof the name \u201cf\u201d will end in a so-called \u201cblock\u201d in the naming\nnetwork (Donnellan 1974; Perry 2001). The dichotomy is\nFigure 1 (Bullot).

Cohen, Douglas T. Kenrick, and Yexin Jessica Li\nDepartment of Psychology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1104.\nadamcohen@asu.edu douglas.kenrick@asu.edu\nyexin.li@asu.edu\nAbstract: Religious beliefs, including those about an afterlife and\nomniscient spiritual beings, vary across cultures. We theorize that such\nvariations may be predictably linked to ecological variations, just as\ndifferences in mating strategies covary with resource distribution.\nPerhaps beliefs in a soul or afterlife are more common when resources\nare unpredictable, and life is brutal and short.\nReligious beliefs, including those about an afterlife and omnis-\ncient spiritual beings, vary across cultures (Cohen & Hall, sub-\nmitted; Cohen et al. 2003). This does not mean they are not\nadaptations, because human behavior represents a continual\nand dynamic interplay between flexible evolved mechanisms\nand variable environmental inputs (Kenrick 2006; Kenrick et al.\n2002). Rather, an evolutionary ecological perspective inspires\nquestions about whether variations in religious beliefs and prac-\ntices are adaptively keyed to variations in human physical and\nsocial environments (ranging from food and shelter to social\nstructure: e.g., status hierarchies, access to mates, and geographi-\ncal distribution of kin relative to self). Cultural norms surround-\ning sexual liaisons (often centrally incorporated into religious\nbeliefs) provide one illustrative case. Such norms vary widely,\nwith some societies and some religions sanctioning only mon-\nogamy, many also accepting polygyny, and a small percentage\npermitting polyandry. These variations correlate predictably\nwith physical and social ecology. For example, Tibetan families\nin which one man marries one woman have fewer surviving chil-\ndren than do families in which brothers pool their resources\n(Crook & Crook 1988). By sharing one wife, brothers can pre-\nserve the family estate, which would not even support one\nfamily if it were subdivided each generation. Brothers in other\nspecies also engage in polyandrous mating when resources are\nscarce. Regarding polygyny, multiple women are particularly\nlikely to marry one man when several conditions converge: (1) a\nsteep social hierarchy, (2) a generally rich environment so one\nfamily can accumulate vast wealth, (3) occasional famines so the\npoor face occasional danger of starvation (Crook & Crook\n1988). Under these circumstances, a woman who joins a large\nwealthy family reaps benefits, even if she would have to share\nher husband with other women. This pattern is also found in\nother species. For example, indigo buntings vary between mon-\nogamy and polygyny, but multiple females only pairup with the\nsame male when that male controls a resource-rich territory\nand his neighbors have poorer territories (Orians 1969).\nWe wish to apply a similar analytic strategy to variations in\nbelief in souls and the afterlife. Different religions have very\ndifferent emphases on the importance of belief in an afterlife\n(emphasized less by Jews, more by Fundamentalist Protestants,\nfor example; Cohen & Hall, submitted). And within a religion,\nsome individuals have much stronger beliefs in an afterlife than\nothers do (Cohen et al. 2005). Furthermore, there are vastly\ndifferent forms of belief in life after death, including reincarna-\ntion, heaven and hell, ghosts, and so forth. Similarly, individuals\nand cultures vary in views of God as vengeful and punishing\n(Abramowitz et al. 2002). It is sometimes claimed that the Old\nTestament God is more vengeful, whereas the New Testament\nGod is more forgiving (but see Cohen et al. 2006).\nCertainly, such variations may be due to particular historical\nfactors affecting the development of a particular religion or the\nlearning history of a particular individual. However, taking a\ncue from Bering, and Atran and Norenzayan (2004) and others,\nwe propose a novel direction for theorizing about belief in life\nafter death. It would be worth investigating whether variations\nin beliefs in afterlife or observant spirits are linked to recurrent\nvariations in social or physical ecology. Bering has proposed\nthat belief in souls has a moral function, among others.\nPerhaps beliefs in a soul or afterlife are more common when\nresources are unpredictable, and life is brutal and short. If\nmost people have predictable and sufficient resources, there\nmay be less need to regulate cooperation. If resources are unpre-\ndictable or scarce, however, supernatural agents may be more\nnecessary: As Durant and Durant (1968, p. 51) suggested, \u201cas\nlong as there is poverty there will be gods.\u201d\nSimilarly, a belief in an omniscient God (who also metes out\npunishment, both during life and after) might be more\ncommon in societies in which people spend more time around\nnon-relatives (who are more likely to punish your transgressions\nseverely, and to cheat on you). If true, one would expect not to\nfind such beliefs as commonly in small groups of closely related\nhunter-gatherers. In social groups including unrelated\nindividuals, on the other hand, other people can\u2019t be watching\nyou all the time to make sure you are not poaching others\u2019\nmates or stealing their food. But invisible, supernatural agents\ncan (or, at least, you don\u2019t know when they are and when they\nare not). According to this line of reasoning, one might suppose\nthat the variable and harsh desert culture in which the Old\nTestament is rooted promoted a view of God as harsh and\nvindictive, whereas the more stable societal structure of the\nNew Testament promoted a view of God as more forgiving.\nReligions that exist in harsh or unpredictable environments (or\nreligions rooted in such environments) may be more prone to\nbelief in souls, or may view God as more punitive. Religions\nthat exist in stable or resource-rich environment (or religions\nrooted in such environments) may be less prone to belief in\nsouls, or may view God as more forgiving.\nThis analysis suggests a need for a functionally based taxonomy\nof religious beliefs and practices, which can be mapped onto a tax-\nonomy of ecological variations to which human groups need to\nadjust. An ecological approach suggests that the traditional\nbeliefs of international religions originally emerged in interaction\nwith particular environmental factors. There are likely pressures\nto maintain the belief systems intact as members migrate to new\nphysical and social environments. Our analysis implies that the\ngroup-level beliefs will change (perhaps slowly) to match new habi-\ntats, and that individual commitment to particular features of those\nbeliefs will change (perhaps more rapidly) to reflect operation of\ncontext-triggered behavioral and cognitive mechanisms. It may\nbe, for example, that even Roman Catholics (who belong to a reli-\ngion with strongly institutionalized checks on heretical thinking)\nhave very different complexes of supernatural beliefs and imagined\noffenses depending on whether they are from an Irish fishing\nvillage, a Sicilian farming community, or a California suburb.\nProduction of supernatural beliefs during\nCotard\u2019s syndrome, a rare psychotic\ndepression\nDavid Cohen and Ange`le Consoli\nDepartment of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, CNRS FRE 2987 Cognition et\nComportement, Universite\u00b4 Pierre et Marie Curie, APHP, Ho\u02c6pital Pitie\u00b4-\nSalpe\u00b4trie`re, 75013 Paris, France.\ndavid.cohen@psl.aphp.fr angele.consoli@psl.aphp.fr\nAbstract: Cotard\u2019s syndrome is a psychotic condition that includes\ndelusion of a supernatural nature. Based on insights from recovered\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n468 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\npatients who were convinced of being immortal, we can (1) distinguish\nbiographical experiences from cultural and evolutionary backgrounds;\n(2) show that cultural significance dominates biographical experiences;\nand (3) support Bering\u2019s view of a cognitive system dedicated to\nforming illusory representations of immortality.\nCotard\u2019s syndrome (CS) is a rare condition in which the central\nsymptom is a delusion of negation. Patients suffering from the\nsyndrome may deny that they exist or that a part of their body\nexists. They may also complain of damnation, possession, or\nother delusional ideas, such as feeling enormous and immortal\nor believing that nothing exists or that another person\u2019s identity\n(doctor, mother) is false. CS generally occurs in patients suffering\nfrom major depression with psychotic features, but it can also\noccur in patients suffering from schizophrenia or organic\nmental conditions (e.g., general paralysis, epilepsy) (Berrios &\nLuque 1995). In young people, it is often associated with bipolar-\nity (Consoli et al., in press; Soultanian et al. 2005). While the\ndescriptions of many psychiatric conditions have changed\nduring the last century (e.g., catatonia, hysteria), CS has been\nshown to have very stable clinical characteristics since it was\nfirst described in 1880 (Berrios & Luque 1995). Healthy\npeople\u2019s beliefs in an afterlife or in other closely related super-\nnatural ideas are not expressed in a delusional way. In the case\nof CS, subjects are temporarily and without self-questioning con-\nvinced that both their soul and body are immortal, or, alterna-\ntively, that they are already dead or damned. The very\nexistence of CS supports Bering\u2019s view of a cognitive system\ndedicated to forming illusory representations of immortality\nand symbolic meaning of natural events. We can hypothesize\nthat, for unknown reasons, the system is productive during CS\nwithout any activation of inhibitory or elaborative repression.\nBecause most patients recover, it gives us an opportunity to get\nsome insights from subjects themselves regarding their feelings\nof being immortal, guilty, or damned. This allows us to dis-\ntinguish biographical experiences from cultural and evolutionary\nbackgrounds.\nTable 1 summarizes the clinical characteristics of 8 patients\nwho we have treated during the last 20 years. The first striking\nobservation is that, for most of the subjects (6\/8) with CS, their\ndelusional ideas could be related to their own life stories\n(Table 1, column 5), despite their having a similar delusional\nframework that included delusions of immortality in 5 cases\n(Table 1, column 4). The last two subjects provided little infor-\nmation about their CS state because of negativism and mental\nretardation, respectively. Case 3 is particularly interesting as\nshe showed remarkable insight after treatment with electro-\nconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Cohen et al. 1997). The delusion\nconsisted of the patient\u2019s absolute conviction she was already\ndead and waiting to be buried, that she was immortal, that\nshe had no teeth or hair, and that her uterus was malformed.\nWhen she recovered, we asked her to express the free associ-\nations that came to mind when her delusional ideas were\nevoked. Concerning having no teeth, she was surprised to\nfind herself thinking of her brother-in-law, a dentist. She\nadded that she would be ashamed to receive dental treatment\nfrom him, and that she had cried every night since her\nsister\u2019s wedding and departure. Concerning the idea of a\ngenital malformation, she remembered guilty feelings associ-\nated with masturbation, which she had practiced from child-\nhood until the onset of puberty.\nThe second striking observation relates on the fact that\ndespite a history of syphilis confirmed by immunology testing,\na 55-year-old man with CS (Case 5) had hypochondriacal con-\ncerns about AIDS, showing that collective and cultural signifi-\ncance dominates biographical experiences during CS. Because\nof pressure from the human social environment, AIDS has\nsubstituted for syphilis as God\u2019s punishment for sins of the\nflesh. In summary, over time, first syphilis then AIDS\nsymbolized the amalgam of flesh, punishment, sin, guilt, sexu-\nality, and the devil. Indeed, the last case of CS with hypochon-\ndriacal fears of syphilis was published in the 1970s (Bourgeois\n1969). Since the 1980s, and in the current series (N \u00bc 3), AIDS\nhas the same symbolic significance that syphilis had until the\n1970s.\nBased mainly on cognitive and developmental psychology,\nBering has postulated that an organized system dedicated to\nforming illusory representations of immortality evolved in\nresponse to selective pressures by the human social environment.\nIf we consider CS as a psychopathological model to explore the\npathological production of supernatural beliefs, Bering\u2019s hypoth-\nesis implies that (1) the beliefs should associate personal\nelements with stable superstructured collective schemas; and\n(2), while stable in their significance, collective schemas should\nintegrate influences from the social environment.

In particular,\nfollowing Levy-Bruhl\u2019s studies of primitive societies (1910) and\nmythology (1935), Darwin\u2019s theory of selection, and his own\nexperience with the psychodynamic approach to psychotic\npatients, Jung also postulated that humans have a natural\ndisposition to believe in an afterlife and religious concepts,\ninfluenced by evolution.\nEvidence for early dualism and a more direct\npath to afterlife beliefs\nDavid Estes\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071.\nestes@uwyo.edu\nAbstract: Ample evidence for dualism in early childhood already exists.\nYoung children have explicit knowledge of the distinction between\nmental and physical phenomena, which provides the foundation for a\nrapidly developing theory of mind. Belief in psychological immortality\nmight then follow naturally from this mentalistic conception of human\nexistence and thus require no organized cognitive system dedicated to\nproducing it.\nBering proposes an organized cognitive system dedicated to\nforming what he terms illusory representations of an afterlife\nand psychological immortality. Belief in the continuation of\npsychological states after death is, as Bering notes, a radical\nform of mind\u2013body dualism, and he seeks evidence for this\ndualism early in individual development. In this commentary I\nbriefly summarize existing empirical evidence, not mentioned\nby Bering, demonstrating that very young children are already\nand explicitly dualists. I conclude by questioning the claim that\nbelief in psychological immortality requires a cognitive system\ndedicated to producing it. I suggest instead a more parsimonious\nalternative in which this belief is just a natural extension of how\npeople, including young children, already think about human\nexistence.\nBering is astute to focus on the common-sense dualism\nbetween mind and body because this conceptual distinction\nand its close relatives play a key role in cognitive development\nby providing the foundation for a mentalistic understanding of\nhuman behavior. This \u201ctheory of mind,\u201d as I will argue, might\nthen be extended to become one source of intuitive notions\nabout the soul and an afterlife. However, it is simply not the\ncase that research into \u201cwhether humans are common-sense\ndualists\u201d is just beginning, as Bering implies. In fact, abundant\nresearch, some of it now two decades old, clearly demonstrates\nthat very early in the preschool years children already understand\nand use a whole family of conceptual distinctions closely related\nto mind\u2013body dualism. These include the basic ontological\ndistinction between the mind and the external world, as well as\nkindred distinctions between mental and physical phenomena,\nbetween fantasy and reality, and between specific thoughts and\nthe things they represent (Estes 1994; Estes et al. 1989;\nWellman & Estes 1986).\nBriefly, this research shows that by 3 years of age children\nalready recognize the defining criteria that distinguish the\ninternal-mental from the external-physical world. They know\nthat mental entities (thoughts, memories, dreams, mental\nimages) are not real in the way that physical entities are, and\nthat they have no permanent existence apart from the mind in\nwhich they occur, are inherently private rather than public,\nand cannot be seen, touched, used, or shared with others in\nthe way that corresponding physical objects can. It is important\nto emphasize here that preschool children\u2019s knowledge of this\nfundamental dualism is not just implicit in their behavior and\nnot merely inferred from their responses in different experimen-\ntal conditions. Instead, they clearly have explicit knowledge of\nhow mental and physical phenomena differ, as demonstrated\nby their capacity to articulate this understanding with convincing\nverbal justifications for their responses. These explanations are\ntypically telegraphic but interpretable at 3 or 4 years of age and\nbecome remarkably adult-like by the age of 5 or 6. These exper-\nimental findings are supported and extended by naturalistic\nresearch on language development showing that even before 3\nyears of age children spontaneously refer to the distinction\nbetween mind and external reality in their conversations in\nnatural settings (Bartsch & Wellman 1995).\nHow do young children comprehend with such apparent ease\nthis fundamental distinction between the internal-mental-subjec-\ntive realm and the external-physical-objective realm, of which\nmind\u2013body dualism is one aspect? It may well be the case that\nthis distinction is of such crucial importance in human social\nlife that, like language or face recognition, we are prepared by\nevolution to get it quickly and easily. But at another level of analy-\nsis, that of everyday human experience, it is also the case that this\nis just how the world is. Children, perceptive creatures that they\nare, rapidly discern this fundamental distinction, which is\nconstantly manifesting itself in their experience, just as it is in\nours. We have minds and we have bodies; there is an internal-\nmental realm and an external-physical realm; and there is\nample evidence in the child\u2019s ongoing experience from which\nto abstract these natural categories.1 The boundary between\nthem may of course break down under rigorous philosophical\nor scientific analysis, but regardless of our expertise or theoretical\nallegiances, we all take this foundational distinction for granted\nand constantly use it in everyday life. The research cited earlier\nshows that preschool children do so, as well.\nHow do we get from this basic dualism to belief in souls, an\nafterlife, and psychological immortality? Bering\u2019s rather clever\nsolution involves a collection of cognitive biases and errors that\ntogether produce these \u201cfunctional illusions\u201d and thereby\nenhance genetic fitness by making it less likely that individuals\nwill engage in acts harmful to their reputations. Leaving aside\nthe perennial question of whether there might really be an after-\nlife of some unknown variety,2 and granting that the specific\nmechanisms in Bering\u2019s account (e.g., simulation constraints,\noffline social reasoning) may indeed be part of the story,\nperhaps the path from the young child\u2019s dualism to belief in an\nafterlife for immortal souls might be fairly direct and require\nno special evolutionary solution. As we have seen, very young\nchildren already have the distinction between mental and phys-\nical phenomena solidly in hand and thus recognize the existence\nand nature of immaterial entities. This provides the essential\nbasis for a mentalistic folk theory of human behavior and the\nframework on which our more general beliefs about human exist-\nence are based. Beliefs about an afterlife can thus be seen as just\nbeliefs about this life, idealized and extended in our imagination\nbeyond the mystery of death. And who wouldn\u2019t want more of\nsuch a good thing?\nNOTES\n1. In addition to abundant naturalistic evidence documenting that\nthey spontaneously talk about their mental states (e.g., Bartsch &\nWellman 1995), there is also experimental evidence indicating that\npreschool children have conscious access to some types of mental activity\n(Estes 1998), which of course would be a prerequisite for abstracting the\nmental\u2013physical distinction from their own experience.\n2.

Existential\nreasoning is contingent on a developing\ntheory of mind\nE. Margaret Evans and Henry M.

If Bering\u2019s selectionist explanation\nwas on target then one might predict a unique and relatively robust\ndevelopmental trajectory, regardless of input. Evidence suggests\ninstead that children\u2019s existential reasoning is contingent on their\ndeveloping theory of mind.\nBering\u2019s focus is naive or intuitive religion in the sense of its\nimport and place in human thinking about one\u2019s own soul,\nvalues, and place \u2013 its existential focus. He highlights important\nissues, and presents many intriguing ideas concerning the\nevolutionary origins of these existential themes. But missing is\nan explicitly developmental framework; in the absence of such\na framework, it is difficult to agree with his claims.\nModern evolutionary theory is itself undergoing a radical\nreconceptualization with development playing a central role,\nso-called Evo-Devo (e.g., Carroll 2006). The discovery of critical\nregulatory genes that alter patterns of gene expression over\ndevelopment was only made possible because of this focus.\nSimilarly, any attempt to offer a modern evolutionary account\nof a psychological process should incorporate development.\nIntuitive existential psychology is closely aligned with intuitive\npsychology \u2013 our everyday understanding of self and others as\nintentional, believing-desiring, communicating agents \u2013 and,\naccording to Bering, with intuitive conceptions of intelligent\ndesign. Past research is clear: intuitive psychology (theory of\nmind) develops \u2013 initial infant biases lead to early conceptions\nthat are considerably revised and expanded in the course of\nchildhood development \u2013 and intuitive understanding of the\norigins and functions of human life also develops. If Bering is\ncorrect and existential reasoning is a consequence of selection\npressures, and not a spandrel, then one might predict a unique\ntrajectory, one that is robust and relatively independent of\nthese other developments. Bering indeed talks of possible devel-\nopments. One clear point is that, unfortunately, little is known,\nyet both the developmental and evolutionary stories to be told\nmust be tightly constrained by such details. Developmental\ndetails are also needed to frame and evaluate the connections\nbetween existential psychology, theory of mind, and intuitive\nconceptions of origins.\nRegarding existence and mind, Bering\u2019s selectionist arguments\nencompass claims of early appearing existential sensitivities\nbacked by some admittedly preliminary data. The data definitely\ndemonstrate development, but the details are not only unknown\nand insufficiently established, they are currently contradictory.\nFor example, Bering suggests (following Barrett) that young\nchildren\u2019s conceptions might be specially commensurate with\nsupernatural conceptions (e.g., gods are not subject to false\nbeliefs). But Barrett et al.\u2019s (2001) work is just as easily inter-\npreted to show that conceptions of God as omniscient are only\nmade possible when children are able to reason about false\nbeliefs. Prior to that point, children cannot make such judgments.\nMoreover, in Bering\u2019s Princess Alice studies, for example, the\nyoungest children (4-year-olds) interpret unexpected events as\nphysically caused and only older children see them as indicative\nof supernatural acts. Such findings suggest that existential\nreasoning is contingent on a developing theory of mind.\nAn important claim is that a na\u0131\u00a8ve dualism leads to beliefs in an\nafterlife in which mind continues independent of body\n(psychological immortality) after death. The developmental\nunfolding of understandings of mind and of death thus\nbecomes intriguing indeed. Bering (also Bering & Bjorklund\n2004) presents a scenario in which younger children (5-year-\nolds) attribute ongoing mental functions after death and such\nattributions decrease with development. Although 5-year-olds\nattribute mental functions to dead individuals in Bering\u2019s\nresearch, they do not do so (and neither do 4-year-olds) in\nother research (e.g., Barrett & Behne 2005; Poling & Evans\n2004). Furthermore, in Flavell\u2019s research 5-year-olds often fail\nto attribute ongoing mental functions (thinking) to waking\npersons; relative to older children, they systematically downplay\nthe amount of consciousness that everyday folk have in everyday\nlife (Flavell et al. 2000). These findings provide an unlikely\nplatform for the bold proposal that rampant attribution of\nmental life to the dead provides a natural starting point for intui-\ntive existential questions. We agree that how children understand\nthese issues is important and can inform our theories of intuitive\nunderstandings of mind, existence, and the divine. But, those\ndevelopments, while to-be-discovered, do not as yet conform to\nBering\u2019s initial outlines. Understandings of death also figure\ninto children\u2019s understandings of origins and design.\nRegarding existence and origins, Bering argues that con-\nceptions of intelligent design are effortlessly aligned with\nbeliefs in immortal souls. Yet, Evans\u2019 (2000; 2001) studies of con-\ncepts of species origins tell a more extended developmental story,\nand one that varies depending on the context. Not surprisingly,\nchildren from Christian fundamentalist communities, whatever\ntheir age, prefer creationist (God made \u201cX\u201d) ideas. Younger chil-\ndren from non-fundamentalist communities, on the other hand,\nendorse a mixture of spontaneous generationist (the very first\n\u201cX\u201d came out of the ground) and creationist ideas. Not until 8\nto 9 years of age were children consistently creationist, regardless\nof community of origin. More recent work along these lines\nsuggests that the younger children were not in a position to\ngrasp origins concepts, because they had not yet fully confronted\nexistential questions (Evans 2005; Evans et al. 2001). To be able\nto respond to questions about the origins of animal kinds, chil-\ndren have to understand that animals are not eternal, in that\nthey were not always here on earth, nor will they continue to\nbe on earth. In the latter studies, the creationism of 4- to 10-\nyear-olds was related to their ability to grapple with existential\nconcepts (death, eternity), and to their understanding that\nhumans (not God) create artifacts, independently of the effects\nof age. Once such existential questions have been grasped, only\nthen can the \u201corigins\u201d question arise: How did the animals get\non earth in the first place? Evans\u2019 claim (2001; 2005) is that chil-\ndren transfer their understanding of the human as an intentional\nmanufacturer of new tools, and apply that to objects that have\narisen naturally, such as \u201cnew\u201d species. For younger children,\nthe idea that \u201cGod did it,\u201d appears to be loosely associated knowl-\nedge, not yet integrated into a conceptual structure (Evans 2001),\nsuggesting that \u201ctestimony\u201d (Harris & Koenig 2006) plays a\ncrucial role in early God concepts. In sum, God as intelligent\ndesigner is a complex (albeit possibly naturally developing), not\nan effortless, idea, which becomes firmly rooted only at the\npoint when children reliably confront existential questions and\nfully understand the role of human artifice (Evans 2005; see\nalso Defeyter & German 2003).\nThus predictions that might follow from Bering\u2019s thesis, such\nthat existential reasoning is effortless, early acquired, and rela-\ntively independent of other developmental processes, are not\nborne out. On the contrary, we suggest that children\u2019s developing\nunderstanding of the mind, in particular, their na\u0131\u00a8ve theories of\nintention, undergird and make possible religious\/existential\nreasoning. Furthermore, this development seems to require an\ninteraction between these processes and community input.\nIdeally, we need an evolutionary-developmental theory of\nexistential reasoning that takes into account cultural context.\nWe are grateful to Bering for initiating this process.\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 471\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe preparation of this commentary was supported in part by NSF Grant\n540152 to Evans and NICHD Grant 22149 to Wellman.\nCulture and development matter to\nunderstanding souls, no matter what our\nevolutionary design\nMichel Ferrari\nHuman Development and Applied Psychology, OISE\/University of Toronto,\nToronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada.\nmeferrari@oise.utoronto.ca\nAbstract: For Bering, appreciating that people are objects is a\ndevelopmental accomplishment. Baldwin and Piaget agree. However,\nfor Piaget, an immanent conception of the divine is more\ndeveloped than a separate transcendent God. Culture also matters. In\nPlato\u2019s Phaedo, Socrates\u2019 belief in immortality was a reasoned\nconclusion \u2013 not \u201cbuilt in\u201d \u2013 for reasons similar to those still held by\nmodern scientists.\nAlmost a century ago, J. R. Angell (1911) wrote, \u201cThe term soul\nhas generally been applied to the supposed spiritual essence of\nhuman personality which persists after death. As such, it is\nconnected with problems not soluble by empirical methods.\nPsychology as an empirical natural science has consequently\nceased to use it as a familiar part of its terminology\u201d (p. 46).\nHe goes on to say, \u201cthe term consciousness itself is likewise in\ndanger of extinction or at least essential modification\u201d (p. 47).\nProphetic words. But with the return of an \u201cessentially modified\u201d\nscience of consciousness, the soul is again a candidate for rehabi-\nlitation \u2013 as long as it remains subject to Neo-Darwinian natural\nselection within a distinctively human social environment, and as\nlong as it is \u201cillusory\u201d (or at least that its immortality and purpose\nare illusory).\nFor Bering, asking \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d suggests a social relation-\nship between the self and a presumed supernatural\ncreator \u2013 a \u201ccognitive illusion\u201d that can help produce \u201cgenetic\nfitness-enhancing\u201d behavior by promoting normative prosocial\nbehavior that that creator has mandated. Bering also suggests\nthat because human social interaction relies on believing that\nabsent agents continue to exist, we have a hard time imagining\nanyone to be dead; that our minds\/brains are not well equipped\nto update complex social rosters. But why go so far? Without\ninvoking anything supernatural, Parker\u2019s (1998) proposal that\nself-conscious emotions, like shame, may have evolved to allow\nparents to govern their children when not physically present to\nenforce social norms \u2013 an influence that might persist beyond\ndeath. If so, then the idea of a universal care-giver, God, is a\nnatural (but culturally bound) extension of this direct social\nexperience.\nPiaget devoted his first lab at the Jean Jacques Rousseau Insti-\ntute to the study of religious experience, and lectured on his\nresults and their implications at Sainte Croix (1923; 1928;\n1930). Vidal (1994a; 1994b) claims that Piaget\u2019s early empirical\nwork on religious experience aimed to provide empirical evi-\ndence for his own metaphysical framework, centered around\nthe idea of the \u201cimmanence\u201d of the divine in human experience.\nIndeed, these early studies by Piaget showed that unconscious\nand affective attachment to different kinds of religious experi-\nences of God (transcendent or immanent) depends on the type\nof parenting one receives and the general socio-political cultural\nenvironment of one\u2019s upbringing (see also Bemmer 2002).\nPiaget\u2019s (1932\/1978) studies of morality grew directly out of his\nwork on religious belief.\nGod thus becomes a \u201csuper-parent\u201d \u2013 an idea also advocated\nby James Mark Baldwin at the turn of the last century.\nBering\u2019s very interesting point that it is structurally simpler and\nso developmentally easier to imagine an omniscient other, God,\nthan to imagine someone who holds false beliefs is directly in\nline with these older theories of development. Likewise,\nBering\u2019s claim that appreciating people to be \u201cjust objects\u201d is a\ndevelopmental accomplishment is exactly Baldwin\u2019s thesis \u2013 an\nidea he leverages for a very creative resolution of the mind\u2013\nbody problem (Baldwin 1903; see also Ferrari 2003). Similarly,\nPiaget\u2019s (1928; 1930) mature thoughts on religious experience\nled him to believe that the tension between transcendent and\nimmanent conceptions of God could be resolved developmental-\nly \u2013 that an immanent conception of the divine (i.e., God as\nintrinsic to our lived experience) was a more developed stage\nof religious experience than experience of a separate, transcen-\ndent God. Writing in a very different Zen tradition, Suzuki\n(1962\/1972) captures this view well when he writes that, the\n\u201cultimate Self is above all forms of dichotomy, it is neither\ninner nor outer, neither metaphysical nor psychological,\nneither objective nor subjective. If the term \u2018Self\u2019 is misleading,\nwe may designate it as \u2018God\u2019 or \u2018Being\u2019 or \u2018the Soul,\u2019 \u2018Nothing\u2019\nor \u2018anything\u2019\u201d (p. 3).\nAre these claims unscientific? I agree with James (1902\/1961),\nthat a \u201crigorously impersonal view of science might one day\nappear as having been a temporarily useful eccentricity rather\nthan the definitively triumphant position which the sectarian\nscientist at present so confidently announces it to be (p. 395,\nfootnote 8).\u201d Certainly, empirical studies support the claim that\nimmanent experience of the divine is indeed much rarer and\ndevelops later than transcendent experiences, documented in\nchildren as young as age six (Argyle 2000). Thus, Bering\u2019s\nsuggestion that children understand God to be a separate and\nhigher being is only half of a more sophisticated developmental\nargument proposed by developmental psychologists of the last\ncentury.\nIn another line of reasoning, Bering also proposes that\nbecause we find it impossible to imagine what it is like for our-\nselves to be dead (what he calls a \u201csimulation constraint\u201d) peo-\nple \u2013 especially children \u2013 naturally tend to think that\npsychological agents survive death. The \u201csimulation constraint\u201d\non imagining death is very plausible. However, although it\nmay be impossible to imagine our own nonexistence psychologi-\ncally, we need not reason about the afterlife by analogy to our\nown spiritual life. As Bering himself says, we know and under-\nstand forms of human existence in which we are unaware \u2013 a\ndreamless sleep, for example \u2013 and can imagine not returning\nfrom that state. Or, to take a classic example, in Plato\u2019s\nPhaedo (c. 350 bce\/1977, subtitled, On the soul), Socrates\nbelieves he will survive death but wants to debate this so as\nnot to die holding a false belief. One objection, made by\nCebes, is that most \u201cmen find it very hard to believe what you\nsaid about the soul [i.e., that it survives death]. They think\nthat after it has left the body it no longer exists anywhere, but\nthat it is destroyed and dissolved on the day the man dies, as\nsoon as it leaves the body; [. . .] dispersed like breath or\nsmoke, has flown away and gone and is no longer anything\nanywhere\u201d (Phaedo, 70a). A little later (85e\u201386d), Simmias\nproposes this analogy: the soul is a kind of harmony produced\nby the body, like the music of a lyre; smash the instrument\nand the harmony is lost. This analogy is essentially the\nDarwinian analogy for mind, something generated by the body\nthrough the course of human evolution to help it survive.\nSocrates has an answer to these objections, although one that\nmay not convince a modern audience \u2013 perhaps not even\nAristotle, writing a few decades later (see Wilkes 1992) \u2013 but\nthis shows that the idea of immortality was a reasoned con-\nclusion. It was not \u201cbuilt in,\u201d at least not for most adults of\nthat time, for reasons that resemble those still held by modern\nscientists; that is, that the soul is nothing other than an\nexpression of the operation of the body, which itself is just a\nbiological material thing, having nothing immaterial about it\nthat can survive death.\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n472 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nAutism, language, and the folk psychology of\nsouls\nStephen Flusberga and Helen Tager-Flusbergb\naDepartment of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305;\nbDepartment of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Boston University School of\nMedicine, Boston, MA 02118.\nsflus@stanford.edu htagerf@bu.edu\nAbstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that people with autism, with\nknown impairments in mechanisms supporting a folk psychology of\nmind or souls, can hold a belief in an afterlife. We focus on the role\nlanguage plays, not just in acquiring the specific content of beliefs, but\nmore significantly, in the acquisition of the concept of life after death\nfor all people.\nThe main goal of Bering\u2019s article is to sketch a Darwinian model\nthat accounts for the near-universal belief in an immortal soul\nand an afterlife. He argues that human social cognition has\nevolved to process information in specific ways that both allow\nfor and engender dualistic thinking about mind and body, as\nwell as related areas of religious or existential thought. It is this\nunderlying cognitive architecture that constitutes the \u201cfolk\npsychology of souls.\u201d Bering stresses the role of theory of mind\nand related cognitive systems in promoting default represen-\ntations of mental states surviving death.\nThis is an interesting and important hypothesis that has many\nramifications for the study of human cognition and culture.\nOur commentary focuses on the consequences of this view for\npredicting how people with specific social-cognitive deficits\nmight conceive of and react to death. We then explore the\nimplications of social-cognitive deficits for Bering\u2019s model, to\naddress the question of whether underlying cognitive architec-\nture is both necessary and sufficient for representing life after\ndeath.\nCan people with autism believe in life after death? Bering\u2019s\nmodel offers guidelines for who is most likely to entertain\nbeliefs in a soul and afterlife, namely, individuals with an intact\ntheory of mind. Indeed, Bering cites evidence that most people\nclaim that what endures after death is the person\u2019s mental\nstates. What about populations with deficits in this domain of\nhuman cognition? It is widely accepted that autism (ASD) is, in\npart, characterized by atypical social-cognitive development\nand domain-specific impairments in theory of mind (e.g.,\nBaron-Cohen et al. 2000). People with ASD have difficulty\nrepresenting the mental states of themselves and others even\nwhen high-functioning individuals with ASD have above-\naverage IQ scores and relatively good language skills (Baron-\nCohen 2000).\nBering\u2019s model suggests that people with autism would be\nmuch less likely to engage in \u201cexistential\u201d thought or to consider\nmental states surviving death, given that they generally fail to\nconsider a person\u2019s mental states even when they are alive.\nAlthough we know of no systematic research that has tested\nthis hypothesis, anecdotal evidence suggests a more complex\npicture. On the one hand, although people with ASD do form\nemotional attachments (Rutgers et al. 2004), in our experience,\nit seems that they do not respond with the same degree of distress\nto the death of a loved one as do non-autistic individuals. This\nprovides support for Bering\u2019s view, as he argues that affective\nresponses may trigger the formation of afterlife representations\nbased on existing social-cognitive mechanisms. Because people\nwith ASD have deficits in these underlying mechanisms, they\nmay not react to death with the same kind of existential crisis,\nand may therefore be less likely to represent life after death.\nOn the other hand, this picture is complicated by the fact that,\nagain based on anecdotal evidence, some people with ASD can\nhold a belief in a soul and afterlife. When asked about what\nhappens to a person after they die, some people with autism\nclaim that they continue to exist in some form; for example,\nthat dead people ascend to heaven.\nWe hypothesize that a person with autism may acquire the\nbelief in an afterlife via language, in the same way as they can\nlearn to pass false belief tasks (Tager-Flusberg & Joseph 2005).\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that for children with\nautism, the single best predictor of passing false belief and\nother theory of mind tasks is linguistic knowledge, especially\nvocabulary and grammatical knowledge. However, even people\nwho pass theory of mind tasks seem not to engage the same\nneurocognitive mechanisms when reasoning about beliefs (e.g.,\nCastelli et al. 2002), suggesting that language may provide an\nalternative way of bootstrapping mental state attribution in\npeople who have impairments to the mechanisms that are gener-\nally engaged for processing theory of mind tasks.\nDoes language contribute to the folk psychology of\nsouls? While Bering acknowledges the role of socio-cultural\nindoctrination in the formation of specific religious concepts,\nhis theory emphasizes the causal role of underlying cognitive\nmechanisms in giving rise to generally dualistic concepts and\nmodes of thought. However, given that people with autism can\nhold dualistic religious beliefs, might language play a more\nsignificant role in the development of the folk psychology of\nsouls? That is, does the structure of our linguistic concepts\nhelp shape the way we think about mind, body, and soul?\nAgain, we know of no empirical research addressing this\nspecific claim, but the behavior of people with autism suggests\nthat language may play a causal role in the development of the\nfolk psychology of souls. Consistent with this hypothesis, many\nphilosophers have proposed that it is conceptual and linguistic\nconfusion that encourages mind\/body separation, rather than\nany innate predisposition. Specifically, they highlight the\nvarious metaphorical ways we talk about the mind and mental\nactivity and argue that it is these disparate conceptual\nrepresentations that propel dualistic thought (e.g., Lakoff &\nJohnson 1999; Melser 2004; Papineau 2002; Ryle 1949;\nWittgenstein 1953). Language and cognition are intimately tied\ntogether, and the experimental evidence cited by Bering\ncannot distinguish between the cognitive and linguistic factors\nthat could be driving universal dualistic beliefs.\nHuman social-cognition may have evolved in such a way so as\nto support belief in a soul and afterlife, but this underlying archi-\ntecture may be neither sufficient nor necessary for such beliefs.\nIn our view, the prevalence of these beliefs likely indicates a\ncomplex and dynamic process consisting of multiple interdepen-\ndent cognitive, affective, linguistic, and cultural components. As\nBering\u2019s own research demonstrates, most people probably do\nnot have a stable, rational set of beliefs in the afterlife. It may\ntherefore be premature to privilege specific social-cognitive\nfactors underlying the \u201cfolk psychology of souls.\u201d There is an\nimportant need for future research to disentangle the different\nelements that motivate these beliefs, and to address the issues\nraised in both Bering\u2019s article and in these commentaries.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nPreparation of this commentary was supported by grants from NIH (U19\nDC 03610; U54 MH 66398) to Helen Tager-Flusberg.\nThe supernatural guilt trip does not take us far\nenough\nNathalia L.

We believe it is\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 473\nimportant to place greater emphasis on the prevalence of supernatural\nbeliefs across other domains, if only to counter simplistic divisions\nbetween rationality and irrationality recently aligned with the\ncontentious science\/religion debate.\nWe are in agreement with Bering\u2019s general thesis that the folk\npsychology of the soul can be traced to the development of intui-\ntive theories regarding the nature of the reality and intentionality,\nas well as the difficulty of conceiving of the state of nonexistence.\nHowever, we contend Bering\u2019s claim that there exists an\n\u201corganized cognitive \u2018system\u2019 dedicated to forming illusory rep-\nresentations\u201d of an afterlife that has \u201cevolved in response to the\nunique selective pressures of the human social environment\u201d\n(target article, sect. 1, para. 5). Bering has proposed that a\nbelief in the afterlife has the effect of promoting prosocial beha-\nvior because of the perceived connection between the moral\nimplications of our actions whilst alive and the possible recrimi-\nnations from the deceased and\/or possible jeopardizing of our\nimmortal souls on death. The first problem we have with this\ncentral thesis is that there are other social mechanisms that do\nnot have anything to do with the folk psychology of souls that\nalso act to constrain and control social behaviour. A brief con-\nsideration of the vast research field on compliance and cognitive\ndissonance proves that people conform to social conventions\nthrough the effect of peer pressure and social evaluation. A\nbelief in retribution from beyond the grave may contribute to\nthis list of cognitive mechanisms for socialization but it does\nseem a little ad hoc to make it a primary mechanism operating\nunder Darwinian selection. After all, many social animals also\nshow behavioural inhibition and prosocial behaviour without\nnecessitating a specialised cognitive mechanism for a belief in\nsouls.\nOur second problem with this central thesis, and the alterna-\ntive theoretical standpoints addressed in the article, is that they\nfail to appreciate the extent of supernatural thinking as a\ngeneral feature of human cognition. Bering offers a convincing\nrange of evidence for the universality of beliefs in an afterlife\nto cast doubt over the \u201cspandrel hypothesis\u201d of supernatural\nthought. We would add that a growing body of literature suggests\nthat belief in an afterlife has many positive cognitive effects, such\nas perceptions of control and security, which may have adaptive\nadvantages. We also agree that previous models of supernatural\nbelief based only on agency-detectors may be sufficient for\ndeities and ghosts but fail to capture many aspects of human\nexperience that are perceived to be under supernatural control.\nFor example, compelling evidence for supernatural beliefs in\nthe domain of folk biology comes from Paul Rozin and colleagues\n(e.g., Nemeroff & Rozin 1994) who have repeatedly shown that\nmoral contagion from items associated with \u201cevil\u201d people is extra-\nordinarily difficult to ignore and is supported by a belief in a phys-\nical manifestation of a moral stance. Or consider the peculiar and\nyet prevalent belief (found in around 90% of adults) that we can\ndetect the unseen gaze of others (Titchener 1898). In both these\nexamples, we expect that a sizeable number of individuals who\nexplicitly reject notions of the afterlife and souls would still\nnevertheless follow the general position that garments can be\ncontaminated and that they can feel the unseen gaze of others.\nThere are similar examples of na\u0131\u00a8ve beliefs in supernatural\nforces in the domain of folk physics. For instance, na\u0131\u00a8ve reason-\ning about dynamics is predominantly in terms of the belief that\nobjects are kept moving by internal forces and not external\nones (e.g., McClosky et al. 1980). These supernatural internal\nforces are in direct contradiction to Newtonian laws of physics,\nbut are characteristic of medieval impetus theories and are\nwidely spread throughout both na\u0131\u00a8ve populations and those\nwith formal physics training. Like supernatural beliefs in an after-\nlife, these na\u0131\u00a8ve impetus theories can be very hard to overcome\nand are often held simultaneously with formal theories of\nNewtonian dynamics and used interchangeably (e.g., Viennot\n1979). The \u201chyperactive agency detector\u201d could not extend to\nexplain these diverse supernatural beliefs across domains of\nthought. On the other hand, it has not been suggested that\ndedicated and uniquely human cognitive systems have evolved\nindividually in each of these domains that account for these\npan-cultural, early developing, and intransient na\u0131\u00a8ve errors. So\nwhile we agree that supernatural thinking about the soul could\nserve to cement social cohesion, supernatural thinking in many\ndomains could operate as socializing mechanisms that enable\nus to think of ourselves as connected to others by tangible\nforces, even though much of that reasoning may be implicitly\nheld. We would argue that supernatural thinking, in the form\nof positing invisible forces that defy scientific validation, is an\ninnate human tendency that goes far beyond the realm of reli-\ngious thought into all domains of knowledge. We see little\nevidence in this article that proves that na\u0131\u00a8ve beliefs in an afterlife\nare qualitatively different from na\u0131\u00a8ve theories in folk biology and\nfolk physics.\nWe feel that it is important to extend this work into other\nrealms of reasoning because recent commentary, figure-headed\nby such prestigious names as Richard Dawkins and Daniel\nDennett, polarizes the debate by aligning religious belief with\nirrational memes propagated by the church and aligning\natheism with rationality. If religious inclination instead proves\nto be associated with a universal human tendency towards super-\nnatural beliefs, from which even atheists are not exempt, this\narbitrary divide could prove to be both dangerous and scientifi-\ncally untenable. Rather, we would prefer that the proposal for\nfuture research, and the debate in general, recognized that we\nall entertain supernatural belief systems which must be taken\ninto account when studying human cognition and behavior.\nSouls do not live by cognitive inclinations\nalone, but by the desire to exist beyond death\nas well\nJeff Greenberg,a Daniel Sullivan,a Spee Kosloff,a and\nSheldon Solomonb\naDepartment of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721;\nbDepartment of Psychology, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866.\nJeff@email.arizona.edu swolf22@email.arizona.edu\nkosloff@email.arizona.edu ssolomon@skidmore.edu\nAbstract: Bering\u2019s analysis is inadequate because it fails to consider past\nand present adult soul beliefs and the psychological functions they serve.\nWe suggest that a valid folk psychology of souls must consider features of\nadult soul beliefs, the unique problem engendered by awareness of death,\nand terror management findings, in addition to cognitive inclinations\ntoward dualistic and teleological thinking.\nBering\u2019s analysis provides an inadequate \u201cfolk psychology of\nsouls\u201d because folks have motivational and affective concerns\nand are heavily influenced by culture, and these factors must\nbe considered, along with cognitive propensities, to account for\nsoul beliefs.\nBering\u2019s reliance on cognitive biases particularly pronounced\nin children is insufficient for two reasons. First, people relinquish\nmany childish beliefs as they mature, as Bering\u2019s research shows.\nAdults generally do not believe dead mice get hungry, or that\ntaller glasses necessarily contain more milk. Why do soul\nbeliefs persist, when so many childhood ideas do not? How can\nsomeone smart enough to elude security and commandeer and\nsteer an airliner precisely into a building believe he will enter a\nparadise filled with 72 virgins on impact?\nSecond, adult spiritual beliefs seem quite different than mere\ncognitive errors of imputing mind; they vary widely across\ncultures and are often quite complex (e.g., Watson 2005). In\nsome cultures, there was no immortal soul, in others only the\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n474 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nwealthy, or only men, or only women who died in childbirth had\nimmortal souls. In some, moral action affected one\u2019s afterlife, in\nothers, not. The first Chinese emperor sent vessels in search of\nthe Islands of Immortality. In the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh,\nGilgamesh, disturbed by the prospect of death, embarked on a\nsearch for immortality. The Christian and Islamic conceptions\nof soul and afterlife are extraordinarily elaborate, buoyed by\nmany symbols and rituals. The Aztec conception involved\nsixteen stages of existence and elaborate rituals, including the\nexcision of sacrificial human hearts while still beating. If\nimmortality beliefs were a simple default by-product of cogni-\ntion, why would these beliefs be so varied and so complex?\nThese fervently held belief systems, with their extensive time,\neffort, and life-consuming rituals, are neither child\u2019s play nor\nsimple elaborations of cognitive errors.\nBy-products of cognitive inclinations cannot account for the\nelaborate nature of soul beliefs and the deep commitments to\nthem. Nor is it likely they are primarily products of selection\nfor avoidance of socially prohibited behavior. The prophet\nZarathustra replaced the Persian class-based notions of afterlife\nreserved for the wealthy with the first modern beliefs in the\nsoul\u2019s fate determined by moral behavior on earth (Kriwaczek\n2002). Thus, belief in afterlife rewards for altruism was\nculturally constructed (partly to enhance social control) and\nmemetically transmitted, rather than selected for as a cognitive\npredisposition.\nA propensity for altruism could result simply from feelings of\nempathy and attachment, and sensitivity to contingencies for tan-\ngible rewards and punishments. Wouldn\u2019t irrational worrying\nabout invisible forces have been counterproductive? Wouldn\u2019t\nself-serving immoral behavior be most adaptive when one\u2019s\ndeities would be the only witnesses? How could cognitive predis-\npositions that caused individuals to sacrifice their own offspring,\nperform time-consuming rituals, or feel crushing guilt at acts that\nviolated the Golden Rule, be selected for, unless these beliefs\nserved some more pressing evolutionary function than protection\nof reputation?\nBering hints at such a function, mitigating existential despair,\nbut gives it insufficient weight. As many have observed (e.g.,\nRank\u2019s Psychology and the Soul, 1931\/1961), the dawning realiz-\nation of the inevitability of death had to be monumentally proble-\nmatic for proto-humans. Many of our physiological systems\nfunction to keep us alive in a perilous world, and yet, thanks to\nour intellect, we know they will inevitably fail. This had to\narouse intense concerns with personal vulnerability, and the\nresulting potential for anxiety would have been immobilizing\nwithout comforting mythic illusions of deistic protections and\nan everlasting soul. To be willing and able to hunt large game,\ncompete for resources, and so forth, such beliefs provided\nnecessary equanimity and confidence. Although these spiritual\nbeliefs would not always over-ride fight or flight responses to\nimminent danger, they would allow individuals and groups to\nfunction more effectively, with their anxieties largely in check.\nWhy would people fear no longer existing when they cannot\neasily simulate it? According to Zilboorg (1943) and others, we\nare predisposed to fear death because it is highly adaptive to\ndo so \u2013 it helps keep us alive. Our brains are designed to react\nto things that threaten our continued existence with fear,\narousal, and defensive responses; from such reactions, it is a\nsimple cortical inference that what we fear is death. Unfortu-\nnately, there is no simple fight or flight response to the knowl-\nedge of the inevitability of death, leading to the elaborate\nsymbolic defenses provided by culture.\nSecond, we fear many things before we have experienced\nthem, things we can\u2019t simulate \u2013 cancer, AIDS, a root canal,\nbungee-jumping. We fear whatever might cause us pain or end\nour existence. Third, the non-dreaming phases of sleep and\nbeing anaesthetized are somewhat similar to death \u2013 in these\nstates, we are not, as far as we can tell, conscious or thinking.\nFinally, we fear death primarily not because of what we\nimagine it to be but for what we can easily imagine it takes\naway: life. We can imagine not seeing, not hearing, not tasting,\nnot smelling, not feeling, not being able to touch or communicate\nwith loved ones, not being able to listen to music, watch movies,\ntake walks, and so on.\nTerror management theory (TMT), based on Becker (1971;\n1973), posits that spiritual beliefs serve the function of helping\nhumans deny the finality of death (Solomon et al. 1991). The\ntheory posits that over childhood, the security base provided by\ncare-taking adults is replaced by deities and cultural authorities.\nJust as the young child sustains the love and protection of its care-\ntakers by meeting standards of worth, the adult typically sustains\nsecurity by adhering to the standards of worth of the spiritual and\nsecular authorities of the culture. From this perspective, deities\nhave so commonly been patriarchal or matriarchal because\nthey have been modeled after the childhood care-takers.\nDeities are also judgers and punishers because in a world full\nof tragic, scary events, a deity who does not dole out punishment\nis not plausible.\nOver 250 studies supporting TMT have documented that\nreminders of death (mortality salience: MS) increase advocacy\nof beliefs and behaviors that serve to convince people that they\nare worthy members of a meaningful universe, rather than\nmere animals fated only to obliteration. For example, MS\nincreases identification with death-transcending groups and\nideologies (e.g., I am more than an animal, I am an American!)\nand bolsters efforts to believe the world is just; and threats to\nthese protective beliefs increase the accessibility of death-\nrelated thought (Greenberg et al., in press).\nBecker argued that worldviews with spiritual components\nwork best for managing terror. This may be why correlational\nevidence consistently finds that religiosity is associated with\nmental health and lower death anxiety (see Pargament 1997).\nImportantly, experimental research provides converging evi-\ndence of a protective terror management role of spiritual belief\n(Greenberg et al., in press). MS increases bias toward\nmembers of one\u2019s religion and against proponents of another,\nreluctance to use religious icons inappropriately, and, among\nthe religious, MS increases belief in an afterlife, religiosity, and\nbelief in prayer. Finally, increased belief in an afterlife and\nmaking religiosity salient to religious people reduce the use of\nsecular terror management defenses such as worldview bolster-\ning, and also reduce death-related thinking (Dechesne et al.\n2003; Jonas & Fischer, in press). Thus, spiritual beliefs protect\npeople from concerns about mortality.\nIn sum, although one could limit analysis to cognitive incli-\nnations, doing so provides a very impoverished folk psychology\nof souls. To truly understand the psychology of souls, we\nshould build on extant knowledge regarding evolution, the\nnature of soul beliefs, and psychological defenses, and acknowl-\nedge the role of the unique selection pressures engendered by\nhuman awareness of death in the evolution of supernatural\nbeliefs.\nLearning that there is life after death\nPaul L.

We suggest four\nreasons why this claim is unsatisfactory.\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 475\nBering proposes that human beings evolved a cognitive system\ndedicated to the belief in an afterlife. In support of that claim,\nhe refers to experiments showing that young children often\nmake continuity claims \u2013 they assert that mental processes,\nnotably thoughts, feelings, and desires continue after death \u2013\nwhereas older children are more likely to deny their continuity.\nBering concludes that this developmental pattern is consistent\nwith the early functioning of the proposed cognitive system but\nnot with the alternative hypothesis of religious teaching. On\nthat hypothesis, claims that mental processes continue after life\nwould be more frequent among older as compared to younger\nchildren.\nWe think the developmental pattern is more complex than\nBering allows and that, on close examination, it underlines a\ncrucial role for religious teaching. First, two recent studies\nindicate that continuity claims increase rather than decrease\nwith age, both in Spain (Harris & Gime\u00b4nez 2005) and in\nMadagascar (Astuti & Harris, submitted). The most plausible\nexplanation of this age change is that as they get older, children\nare increasingly likely to encounter and assimilate afterlife\nbeliefs in their community. A likely explanation for the retrench-\nment of such beliefs reported by Bering is that children\ncome to differentiate between the fate of human beings and\nother animals, including mice (the focus of Bering\u2019s research):\nthey learn that human beings enjoy an afterlife whereas mice\ndo not.\nStill, Bering could reasonably insist that children start out\nwith a global and innate set of afterlife beliefs, even if religious\nteaching reinforces or denies their application to particular\ncreatures. However, other evidence undermines this defence.\nAstuti and Harris (submitted) report that 7-year-old Vezo\nchildren in Madagascar generally assert that all processes that\nsustain or are sustained by life, including cognitive and emotional\nprocesses, cease at death. The most plausible explanation for\nthis finding is that Vezo children have considerable first-hand\nexperience of the biology of death because they observe and\nactively participate in the slaughter and dismemberment of\nanimals, and they routinely attend funerals where they observe\nthe persistent immobility of the corpse and experience the\nstench of decomposition. On the other hand, they are given no\nexplanation of the meaning of the various ancestral and burial\nrites that they witness (Astuti, forthcoming a).\nThird, we note that other developmental findings cast\ndoubt on Bering\u2019s simulation-based proposal that children find\nit difficult to conceive of the absence or cessation of mental\nprocesses, including thinking, because they have never experi-\nenced any such cessation. A series of experiments by Flavell\nand his colleagues has shown that young children readily\nconceive of an absence of thinking. Indeed, they do so in circum-\nstances where adults would typically assume that thinking is all\nbut inevitable. For example, when asked whether it is possible\nto sit quietly and entertain no thoughts for a sustained period,\nthe majority of 5-year-olds assert that it is possible (Flavell\net al. 2000).\nFinally, we note that whatever disposition children and adults\nshow toward afterlife beliefs, their assertion or denial of those\nbeliefs is quite context-sensitive. When asked about death in\nthe context of religious practices, beliefs in continuity are acti-\nvated; when asked about death in the context of medical or\nsecular practices, beliefs in discontinuity are activated (Astuti &\nHarris, submitted; Harris & Gime\u00b4nez 2005). This context-\nsensitivity is mirrored in everyday life: A dead corpse may be\nprepared for burial with no expectation that it retains sentience;\nthe dead person, by contrast, may well be attributed thoughts and\nfeelings (see Astuti [forthcoming b] for an ethnographic illus-\ntration from Madagascar).\nIn sum, although we do not dispute the claim that children and\nadults are prone to think in a dualistic fashion, we doubt that\nsuch a tendency reflects an evolved system dedicated to afterlife\nbeliefs.\nFolk psychology meets folk Darwinism\nJay Hegde\u00b4a and Norman A.

An evolutionary\nexplanation for any biological phenomenon must meet rigorous criteria,\nbut the facts in this case, even when taken at their face value, fall well\nshort of these criteria.\nEvolutionary adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should\nnot be used unnecessarily, and an effect should not be called a function\nunless it is clearly produced by design and not by chance.\n\u2014G. C. Williams (1966)\nBering\u2019s proposal has two main facets. The first deals with evi-\ndence that purports to show that beliefs in the supernatural are\nadvantageous to those who hold them. For the sake of argument,\nwe will take this evidence at face value so we can focus on the\nsecond facet of Bering\u2019s proposal, which consists of his hypoth-\nesis that such beliefs arise from \u201can organized cognitive\n\u2018system\u2019 dedicated to forming illusory representations\u201d that has\n\u201cevolved in response to the unique selective pressures of the\nhuman social environment\u201d (target article, sect. 1, para. 5).\nBering claims that his hypothesis is \u201cgrounded\u201d in the theory of\nnatural selection, but provides no explanation whatsoever as to\nhow. This is unfortunate, because such an exercise would have\nmade it self-evident that an evolutionary hypothesis is neither\nwarranted nor justified in this case. Although Bering\u2019s hypothesis\nis intuitively appealing, it is invalid because it arises from a mis-\napplication of the theory of natural selection. Given the evidence\nat hand, invoking the theory of natural selection to explain the\nprevalence of beliefs is about as scientifically valid as invoking\nthe theory of gravitation to explain the attraction between two\npeople.\nBriefly, for a given trait to evolve through natural selection,\nindividual organisms with the trait must have greater fitness,\nthat is, be more likely to survive and reproduce. Specifically,\nthis means not only that a given trait must be heritable, but\nalso that the trait must either increase the fitness of the organism\nby itself or must be associated with (or, technically speaking, be\npleiotropic to) one or more of other heritable traits that do so (for\na more rigorous treatment of the subject, see Futuyma 1998).\nIn the present context, the aforementioned evolutionary prin-\nciples require not just that the belief in the supernatural be a\nheritable trait, but also that those in the relevant previous gener-\nations who held such beliefs were more likely to have survived\nand reproduced. Bering does not even begin to establish either\nthe heritability or the increased fitness, much less both. The\nclosest he comes to doing this is to argue that the beliefs in the\nsupernatural are useful to people who hold them. But sociologi-\ncal utility is a far cry from fitness. In other words, the fact that\nthose who hold such beliefs fit in better from the social\nstandpoint does not mean that they have greater fitness from\nthe evolutionary standpoint. Of course, our objection here is\nnot that Bering fails to use insider\u2019s jargon when referring to\nevolutionary concepts, but that he confuses non-evolutionary\nconcepts for evolutionary ones. In as much as he infers natural\nselection based on sociological utility, Bering is indeed confusing\nutility with fitness. As to heritability, the closest Bering comes to\naddressing it is to argue that \u201cKindergartners understood that\nvarious biological imperatives . . . no longer applied to the dead\nmouse\u201d (sect. 2, para. 2), which hardly lays the issue to rest.\nOf course, natural selection is not the sole mechanism of evol-\nution. Mutation, the ultimate source of variation on which natural\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n476 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nselection can act, can alone result in evolutionary change over\ntime. While natural selection is the driving force behind all\nadaptive evolution, non-adaptive processes such as genetic\ndrift, meiotic drive, and a few other forces can also lead to evol-\nutionary changes (Futuyma 1998). However, Bering\u2019s hypothesis\nwould not be any more valid if it were based on non-adaptive\nevolutionary forces.\nTo be fair, Bering is hardly alone in misapplying the theory of\nevolution to explain higher cognitive functions. Since all living\nthings are products of evolution, there is a widespread tendency\nto treat evolution as a default explanation for all things biological.\nAlthough this is understandable, it is also scientifically na\u0131\u00a8ve.\nOf course, that is not to say either that cognitive phenomena\nhave no basis in evolution or that they inherently defy evolution-\nary explanations. Rather, it is to emphasize that any evolutionary\nexplanation for a given biological phenomenon, cognitive or\notherwise, must at a minimum demonstrate that the relevant\ntrait is heritable and, in cases where natural selection is\ninvoked, that it increases fitness. The genuine difficulty of study-\ning the evolutionary basis of cognitive phenomena is that both\nheritability and fitness effects are exceedingly hard to establish\nfor these phenomena. This does not mean that no evolutionary\nexplanations for such phenomena are to be ventured, but that\nthey are to be ventured with appropriate caution and adequate\ngroundwork. Clearly, Bering\u2019s hypothesis is burdened with\nneither.\nIn a sense, evolutionary biology of higher cognitive phenom-\nena is like astrophysics or paleontology, where direct measure-\nments are often all but impossible, and experimentation is\nharder. In such cases, one has no choice but to substitute tests\nand measurements with informed speculation, \u201cinformed\u201d\nbeing the operative word. But in such an event, the speculative\naspects must not only be acknowledged, but highlighted, and\nthe underlying risks and implications of the substitutions must\nbe carefully assessed. Bering does none of this. In light of all\nthese problems, it is surprising to us that Bering chooses to\ncouch his hypothesis in the onerous theory of natural selection\nand not some less exacting and more suitably ambiguous\nconcept like cultural evolution (see, e.g., Mesoudi et al. 2006;\nRicherson & Boyd 2005). Why must it be natural selection and\nwhy won\u2019t a less demanding theory do? Being does not say.\nUltimately, in order to establish that his hypothesis has any\nrelation to the theory of natural selection, Bering must, at a\nminimum (1) demonstrate heritability and fitness effects for the\nbelief system in question, (2) prove that these parameters are\nsomehow irrelevant to his hypothesis, or (3) show that our formu-\nlation of the minimum requirements of the theory of natural\nselection is incorrect. Failing this, he must concede that his\nhypothesis has no basis whatsoever in evolutionary theory.\nNatural selection and religiosity: Validity\nissues in the empirical examination of afterlife\ncognitions\nBrian M. Hughes\nDepartment of Psychology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Galway\nCity, Ireland.\nbrian.hughes@nuigalway.ie\nAbstract: Bering\u2019s target article proposes that the tendency to believe in\nan afterlife emerged (in evolutionary history) in response to selective\npressures unique to human societies. However, the empirical evidence\npresented fails to account for the broader social context that impinges\nupon researcher\u2013participant interactions, and so fails to displace the\nmore parsimonious explanation that it is childhood credulity that\nunderlies the acquisition of afterlife beliefs through cultural exposure.\nAs part of a fascinating case for a folk psychology of souls, Bering\nargues that believing in an afterlife is an evolutionarily inherited\nhuman tendency. However, although he provides much illustra-\ntive evidence, it is largely circumstantial in nature. Bering fails\nto take account of threats to validity that inevitably arise when\nresearching such speculative and sensitive cognitions as\npeople\u2019s beliefs in their own psychological immortality.\nTo support the claim that afterlife beliefs are innate, Bering\ncites research where child participants are asked to describe\nthe ongoing thoughts of a recently killed (fictitious) mouse\n(Bering & Bjorklund 2004). The assumption inherent in this\nwork is that as children have not yet developed explicit religiosity,\ntheir quasi-religious views are more likely to be innate than\nacquired. Thus, when the children respond that the animal\ncontinues to have thoughts and wishes, the researchers conclude\nthat this indicates their belief in an afterlife. However, the exter-\nnal, internal, and construct validity of such research is highly\nquestionable.\nExternal validity is threatened because children\u2019s views on\ndead mice are not clearly generalizable to their beliefs about\nthe immortality of souls. For one thing, children\u2019s well estab-\nlished capacity to engage in counterfactual thinking (Riggs &\nPeterson 2000), which underlies their ability to engage in\npretend play, may lead them to think differently about dead\nmice in experimental vignettes compared to dead people in\nreal life. Internal validity is threatened by a failure to include a\ncontrol condition, wherein children\u2019s beliefs about the agency\nof inanimate objects in general might be probed. The attribution\nof agency to inanimate objects has been observed in both chil-\ndren and adults (Barrett & Johnson 2003). Thus, it is impossible\nto determine whether children\u2019s comments about the \u201cthoughts\u201d\nof dead mice are any more profound than similar comments\nabout chairs, cars, or computers.\nAs is typically the case in research with children, construct\nvalidity is threatened by the likelihood that responses to exper-\nimental questions will be influenced by the experimenters\u2019\nseniority in age and status. The fact that children make what\nfor them are counter-intuitive inferences in order to accommo-\ndate the assumptions implicit in (adult) researchers\u2019 odd ques-\ntions is long documented in psychology (e.g., McGarrigle et al.\n1978; cf. Hilton 1995). In this case, perceiving the adult to be\nan authority figure, child participants may have inferred from\nthe questions asked that it is to be expected that the mouse\u2019s\nmind continue to function. As it cannot be guaranteed that\nparticipants genuinely hold the beliefs attributed to them, the\nquestion of whether such beliefs might be innate becomes moot.\nRather than postulating an innate propensity to believe in\nsouls, a more parsimonious theory might invoke the evolutionary\nbenefits of credulity among children. Given the need for gui-\ndance to navigate the treacherous environments that characterize\nearly childhood, it is likely that children\u2019s unquestioning faith in\nwhatever adults tell them is highly adaptive (Dawkins 2003). As\nvirtually all young children are presented (directly and indirectly)\nwith the idea of the immortality of souls, it should be unsurpris-\ning if such a notion becomes widely believed. It is this propensity\nfor credulity that represents evolution\u2019s legacy to spiritualism,\nand not an innate propensity to intuit the existence of an afterlife\nper se. By relying on fewer antenatal inputs, theories of innate\ncredulity are more parsimonious than ones of innate beliefs\nabout existence. Indeed, researchers who infer an innate belief\nin afterlives in the absence of sufficient evidence could them-\nselves be accused of holding unsubstantiated beliefs in a\nbeforelife, namely, the sense in which an individual\u2019s personhood\n\u201cexists\u201d (such that it is endowed with fundamental beliefs) before\nhe or she is even born.\nHowever, Bering may well be correct about the reasons\nwhy many adults develop strong beliefs in afterlives (which are\nthen transmitted to credulous children). Nonetheless, gathering\nempirical evidence here is also problematic, as problems\narising from experimenter\u2013participant interactions are not\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 477\nconfined to research on children. For example, in another study\ncited (Bering 2002a), adult participants are presented with vign-\nettes and asked questions like \u201cNow that [the person] is dead,\ndoes he want to be alive?\u201d This research is mentioned in the\ncontext of simulation constraints, and so participant hesitation\nis taken to imply an incapacity (among adults) to imagine what\nbeing dead is like. However, again, the participant\u2019s judgment\nof the researcher\u2019s own mental state is being ignored. It could\nsimply be that participants hesitate because they are confused\nby an apparently bizarre interrogation (asking themselves \u201cIs\nthis a trick question?\u201d), or are contemplating how best to be\npolite in a socially awkward situation (\u201cHow do I respond\nwithout offending the questioner\u2019s apparent belief in an after-\nlife?\u201d). Adults may readily imagine death, as might be suggested\nby research that examines the consequences of being invited\nto do so (e.g., research into Terror Management Theory;\nGoldenberg et al. 2000).\nHowever, despite the precarious nature of self-report evidence\nin studies of controversial, emotionally charged belief systems,\nBering\u2019s argument is not necessarily empirically unsupportable.\nComparison of the views of children who are and are not\npresented with afterlife concepts by their environments (e.g.,\nby their parents) might elucidate to what extent children\ndevelop such beliefs spontaneously. Objective (e.g., biological)\nindices of behavior may also be revealing. Studies of phenomena\nsuch as the placebo effect and its stimulation by social support\n(Wall 1999) may corroborate claims that humans possess innate\ncharacteristics that reinforce \u201cmoral\u201d behavior (which, by provid-\ning people with a stake in long-term outcomes of behavior, would\nindirectly support folk assumptions regarding psychological\nimmortality), while also informing theories about the evolution\nof moral judgment. Complementary evidence may emerge\nfrom research into the genetics of altruism (e.g., Jansen & van\nBaalen 2006).\nIn summary, it is clear that many people believe in an afterlife.\nHowever, Bering\u2019s case that such a belief is evolutionarily primed\n(and therefore innate) is persuasive but not conclusive. It does\nnot displace the more parsimonious explanation that childhood\ncredulity underlies the acquisition of afterlife beliefs through\ncultural exposure.\nTranscendental self-organization\nCarl N. Johnsona and Melanie Nyhofb\naDepartment of Psychology in Education, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,\nPA 15260; bDepartment of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,\nPA 15260.\njohnson@pitt.edu men19@pitt.edu\nAbstract: Bering makes a good case for turning attention to an organized\nsystem that provides the self with transcendental meaning. In focusing\non the evolutionary basis of this system, however, he overlooks the self-\norganizing properties of cognitive systems themselves. We propose that\nthe illusory system Bering describes can be more generally and\nparsimoniously viewed as an emergent by-product of self-organization,\nwith no need for specialized \u201cillusion by design.\u201d\nBering seeks to direct the cognitive science of religion beyond its\nrecent focus on concept acquisition and agency detection toward\nconsidering how supernatural inferences frame the meaning and\nmorality of the self. This shift potentially opens the door for links\nwith the emerging study of spiritual development, which has\notherwise been focused on issues of meaning, morality, and\nidentity (see Roehlkepartain et al. 2006). In his present article,\nhowever, Bering speaks exclusively to evolutionary scholars,\nencouraging them to explore the possibility that an illusory\ncognitive system evolved as the result of selective pressures.\nWhile worthy of exploration, Bering\u2019s evolutionary proposal\nis limited in two significant ways. First, the \u201cDarwinian\nmechanisms\u201d are left completely unspecified. Second, the Darwi-\nnian proposal is not weighed against a non-Darwinian alternative.\nBering leaves it for future investigators to explore the mechan-\nisms that generate the illusory existential system. It is not even\nclear what the mechanisms are supposed to produce. The\nsystem as a whole includes three components: ordinary cognitive\nprocesses (simulation, teleology, and theory of mind), the specific\nillusions, and their organization into a cognitive system. Presum-\nably, Bering is not looking to account for the basic cognitive\nprocesses. The search, hence, must be for some added illusion-\nproducing and integrative mechanisms that generate a distinctive\nmetaphysical theory of self.\nThe alternative, more parsimonious possibility is that the\ncognitive illusory system emerges from ordinary processes\nthrough self-organization. In a Kantian sense, transcendental\nillusions are the inevitable product of the operation of ordinary\ncognitive processes as they extend beyond normal boundaries\nof operation. Beside the illusions that Bering describes, there\nare classic illusions that arise from reflective ideas, wherein the\norder inherent in concepts is uncritically assumed to exist in\nthe world. In any case, once generated, these transcendental\nideas are powerfully relevant and pragmatically regulatory, pre-\ncisely because they reflect higher-order organization that is\nintrinsically valuable to the self (see Johnson 2000).\nSystems of transcendental belief are thus the result of self-\norganization, whereby ideas generated by the self come to\norganize and regulate the self. In this framework, religious\nideas are not the sterile by-product of cognitive relevance\n(attention and memory). Nor are they specifically adaptive\nillusions by design. Rather, they are emergent by-products that\nhave self-relevance.\nEpidemiologically, religious ideas are spread, not simply\nbecause of their cognitive relevance, but because of their vital\nrelevance. Religious ideas stick around because they are relevant\nto the goals, status, and value of the self.\nTranscendental illusions are the natural outgrowth of human\ncognitive organization. The cognitive system primarily functions\nto orient the organism to what is vitally important, not what is\nstrictly, objectively real. To this end, information is organized\nin terms of prototypes, ideals, essences, narratives, and the like.\nThese organizational processes commonly give rise to ideas\nregarding the existence of a higher, deeper order, beyond the\nperceptible given.\nClearly we need to know a lot more about the origins and\nadaptive function of transcendental ideas. Bering turns attention\nto a particularly intriguing system of belief. Whether or not this\nparticular system was selected by design, we need to better\nunderstand the wider human tendency to imagine transcendental\norder that serves to regulate the self.\nSix feet over: Out-of-body experiences and\ntheir relevance to the folk psychology of souls\nDavid Kemmerera and Rupa Guptab\naDepartment of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences, Purdue University,\nWest Lafayette, IN 47907; bDepartment of Biological Sciences, Purdue\nUniversity, West Lafayette, IN 47907.\nkemmerer@purdue.edu gupta10@purdue.edu\nhttp:\/\/www.cla.purdue.edu\/slhs\/Pages\/fac_staff\/faculty\/\nkemmerer.html\nAbstract: During an out-of-body experience (OBE), one sees the world\nand one\u2019s own body from an extracorporeal visuospatial perspective.\nOBEs reflect disturbances in brain systems dedicated to multisensory\nintegration and self-processing. However, they have traditionally been\ninterpreted as providing evidence for a soul that can depart the body\nafter death. This mystical view is consistent with Bering\u2019s proposal that\npsychological immortality is the cognitive default.\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n478 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nReligious experience and behavior play important roles in all\nhuman cultures and hence deserve to be treated as natural\nphenomena worthy of careful scientific investigation (Dennett\n2006). We commend Bering for his insightful and provocative\ncontribution to this new field of research.\nBering argues that \u201ccommon-sense mind-body dualism\u201d is a\ncognitive adaptation that evolved through natural selection.\nAccording to this view, human beings are designed to believe\nthat everyone has an immaterial, immortal soul that is linked to\nthe body during life but leaves it behind after death (see\nHumphrey 2006, pp. 124\u201329, for a similar argument). In this com-\nmentary we relate Bering\u2019s proposal to one of the most bizarre and\nemotionally powerful alterations of consciousness that people are\ncapable of undergoing, namely out-of-body experiences (OBEs),\nin which the subjective sense of self appears to part company\nwith the physical body (e.g., Blackmore 1982; Blanke et al. 2004;\nBrugger 2006; Green 1968; Metzinger 2003).\nBlanke and Arzy (2005, p. 16) state that an OBE has three phe-\nnomenological characteristics: \u201cdisembodiment (location of the\nself outside one\u2019s body), the impression of seeing the world\nfrom a distant and elevated visuospatial perspective (extracorpor-\neal egocentric perspective), and the impression of seeing one\u2019s\nown body (autoscopy) from that elevated perspective.\u201d This is\nillustrated by the following example (Irwin 1985; case 1): \u201cI was\nin bed and about to fall asleep when I had the distinct impression\nthat \u2018I\u2019 was at the ceiling level looking down at my body in the\nbed. I was very startled and frightened; immediately [afterward]\nI felt that I was consciously back in the bed again.\u201d OBEs have a\nprevalence of approximately 10% in the general population\n(Blackmore 1982; Irwin 1985, pp. 219\u201359). They occur in\nmany diverse cultures (Shiels 1978) and are frequently men-\ntioned in folklore, mythology, spiritual writings, and literature\n(e.g., Arzy et al. 2005; McCulloch 1992). Indeed, they are so\nwidespread that Metzinger (2003, p. 502) calls them a \u201cphenom-\nenological archetype\u201d of humanity. Although OBEs can be\ninduced by hallucinogenic drugs such as ketamine (Hansen\net al. 1988) and phencyclidine (PCP; Rosse et al. 1994),\nthey happen spontaneously only once or twice in a lifetime\n(Blackmore 1982; Green 1968), usually in dangerous, traumatic\nsituations such as rape (Sierra & Berrios 1998) and near-death\nepisodes (Greyson 2000). Remarkably, in such circumstances\nsubjects feel as if it is their bodies that are threatened, not their\nselves. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is not sur-\nprising that OBEs have been widely regarded throughout history\nas confirming the intuition that every human being has an\nethereal soul that can literally detach from the physical body,\nmost importantly when that body expires. Metzinger (2003,\np. 503) even goes so far as to formulate the \u201csoul hypothesis,\u201d\nwhich maintains that OBEs are what \u201cfirst led human beings to\nbelieve in a soul\u201d (see also Metzinger 2005).\nAs yet, however, psychological experiments have failed to\nverify the supernatural interpretation of OBEs as involving\ngenuine mind\u2013body separation (Alvarado 1992; 2000; Blackmore\n1982, pp. 200\u201339; Irwin 1985). In addition, Olaf Blanke and his\ncolleagues have succeeded in demystifying OBEs even more by\nmarshalling several sources of neuroscientific evidence that\nsuggest that these strange experiences arise from abnormal\nself-processing in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), predomi-\nnantly in the right hemisphere (for reviews see Blanke & Arzy\n2005; Blanke & Mohr 2005; Mohr & Blanke 2005). During an\ninvasive cortical mapping procedure with an epileptic patient,\nit was found that direct stimulation of the TPJ reliably elicited\nOBEs and other types of visual body-part illusions (Blanke\net al. 2002). More recent studies with neurological patients\n(Blanke et al. 2004) and healthy subjects (Blanke et al. 2005)\nhave corroborated the importance of the TPJ in generating\nOBEs and have begun to reveal the specific neurophysiological\nmechanisms that underlie them. Normally the TPJ helps create\na unified, central representation of the body \u2013 a physical\nanchor for the mental self \u2013 by integrating visual, tactile,\nproprioceptive, and vestibular signals. OBEs may therefore\narise when paroxysmal dysfunctions in the TPJ lead to strong dis-\ncrepancies between the felt and the seen position of one\u2019s own\nbody. Blanke and Arzy (2005) suggest that otholithic vestibular\ndysfunctions may be an especially important precipitating\nfactor for OBEs, because they have been independently linked\nnot only with feelings of elevation and floating, but also with\n180\n\u00d0\ninversions of one\u2019s visuospatial perspective. In particular,\nsuch illusions have been experienced by astronauts during\nspace missions (Mittelstaedt & Glasauer 1993) and by pilots\nduring the microgravity phase of parabolic flights (Lackner\n1992). Further research will undoubtedly continue to illuminate\nthe neural bases of OBEs and their role in religious activity\n(Previc, in press). For example, there may be connections\nbetween OBEs and new evidence that the TPJ is engaged\nwhen a person imagines how the spatial relations between\ntwo objects would appear from someone else\u2019s point of view\n(Aichhorn et al. 2006). Similarly, there may be connections\nbetween OBEs and new evidence that partially distinct cortical\nregions subserve the visual perception of one\u2019s own and other\npeople\u2019s body parts (Saxe et al. 2006).\nNevertheless, it seems likely that no matter how much pro-\ngress is made in explaining OBEs solely in terms of the structures\nand operations of the brain, a substantial proportion of the\nhuman population will still prefer to interpret OBEs as involving\na true liberation of the soul from the body, a liberation of the kind\nthat everyone ultimately undergoes when they die. After all, as\nBering points out, belief in psychological immortality seems to\nbe our cognitive default.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nOur title is borrowed from Roach (2006).\nCultural adaptation and evolved, general-\npurpose cognitive mechanisms are sufficient\nto explain belief in souls\nKenneth R. Livingston\nDepartment of Psychology and Program in Cognitive Science, Vassar College,\nPoughkeepsie, NY 12604-0479.\nlivingst@vassar.edu\nAbstract: It is suggested that general-purpose cognitive modules are\nthe proper endophenotypes on which evolution has operated, not\nspecial purpose belief modules. These general-purpose modules\noperate to extract adaptive cultural patterns. Belief in souls may be\nadaptive and based in evolved systems without requiring that a specific\ncognitive system has evolved to support just such beliefs.\nIn its strong form Bering\u2019s evolutionary adaptationist argument in\nthe target article proposes to explain how it is that so many hun-\ndreds of millions of people are capable of believing the same six\nimpossible things before breakfast. In this same strong form it\nleaves unanswered the question of why so many hundreds of\nmillions of people (estimates vary but see Barrett et al. 2006)\ndisavow such beliefs. Bering suggests that the evolved tendency\nto believe in souls remains operative even in self-proclaimed\n\u201cextinctivists,\u201d some of whom endorse the idea that dead\npeople know that they are dead (Bering 2002a), but this\nfinding hardly shows that this confusion reflects an evolved adap-\ntation. Thoughtful and clever as it is, Bering\u2019s analysis presents us\nwith a false alternative between two explanations of the wide-\nspread belief in souls. The cultural epidemiological alternative\nviews all religious ideas, including ideas about an afterlife, as\nnon-adaptive byproducts of general-purpose cognitive processes.\nBering\u2019s alternative is that the belief in an afterlife is a specific,\nevolved adaptation that extends the temporal boundaries of\nthe self in ways that minimize counter-reproductive behavior. I\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 479\nwould like to suggest a third option that combines the cultural\nselection of the former view with a limited version of the adapta-\ntionism of the latter approach.\nThis cultural adaptationist view has to show that the case for\nspecific biological adaptation is weak, while showing that belief\nin souls has some adaptive value under at least some circum-\nstances. Space permits only a sketch in response to Bering\u2019s evol-\nutionary argument, but the general strategy can be demonstrated\nwith a few examples. For example, Kuhlmeier et al. (2004) found\nthat 5-month-olds do not apply the same principle of continuous\nmotion to humans that they apply to inanimate objects, from\nwhich Bering concludes that they are intuitive dualists. But\nKuhlmeier et al. themselves acknowledge that one cannot tell,\n\u201cwhether the results of the present study are due to a distinction\nbetween animates versus inanimates, intentional agents versus\nnon-intentional objects, or humans versus other entities\u201d\n(p. 101). Nor does the fact that kindergartners make more psycho-\nlogical attributions to a dead mouse than do older children or\nadults show that the origins of such beliefs cannot be exclusively\ncultural. Children routinely produce conceptual overgeneraliza-\ntions in early and middle childhood (Bloom 2004). Furthermore,\nthe non-adult pattern of attributions to the dead made by young\nchildren must be viewed in the light of considerable evidence\nthat the concept of death itself is poorly grasped until well into\nmiddle childhood (Childers & Wimmer 1971) and varies as a func-\ntion of culture (Yang & Chen 2006) and religious upbringing\n(Florian & Kpavetz 1985). In general, alternative accounts,\nsketched below, are available for the evidence Bering reviews.\nBering carefully notes that specific beliefs about the afterlife\ncan vary across cultures, arguing that the tendency to have\nbeliefs of this kind is universal and thus best explained by\nappeal to evolutionary processes. But general-purpose cognitive\nmechanisms operating on varying cultural content may still find\ncommon patterns or kinds because some of these mechanisms\nare in the business of doing just that. For example, the fact\nthat people continue to behave on occasion as if a deceased\nperson is still alive has to be weighed against the same tendency\nto continue habitual behaviors toward vanished inanimate\nobjects (walking around a chair that has been moved, reaching\nfor a light switch that has been replaced, etc.). Similarly, the\nfact that there is a tendency in many cultures to reinforce author-\nitarian proscriptions by appeal to unseen watchers (ancestors,\ngods, or God) might be evidence for an evolved functional illu-\nsion that the self transcends time and place, but an equally\nsound argument can be made that a combination of a general\ncapacity for off-line prediction and the ability to think abstractly\nabout non-perceptual events and objects have been recruited by\nmany successful cultures to enhance the adaptation of their\nmembers to life\u2019s vagaries. Although the relevant theory in this\ncase is also speculative, Occam\u2019s razor favors an appeal to the\nevolutionarily adaptive advantages of these general-purpose cog-\nnitive endophenotypes (e.g., see Kanazawa 2004) over the appeal\nto a specific, error-based module for belief in souls. Belief in an\nafterlife is far from the only common feature of religious systems\nand one can\u2019t help worrying that religion modules will begin to\nproliferate uncontrollably. If we need a special purpose soul\nsystem, can modules for belief in creation narratives, the power\nof ritual and magical artifacts, angels, demons, incantations,\nand so forth be far behind?\nPursuing the theoretical strategy of using general cognitive\nmechanisms to explain religion does not, however, commit one\nto the view that religion is maladaptive or non-adaptive. A sub-\nstantial literature indicates an association between religious\ncommitment and happiness, health, and well-being (Hiadt\n2005; Koenig & Cohen 2002; Livingston 2002). Often over-\nlooked, however, are the individual differences in the adaptive\nsignificance of religious belief, including belief in the afterlife.\nFor example, Ellison (1991) has shown that the benefits of\nreligious belief tend to accrue only to those who hold them\nwith strong conviction. Furthermore, this degree of existential\ncertainty interacts with level of education and frequency of life\ntrauma to determine life-satisfaction and happiness. It also\nappears that strong atheistic convictions confer the same benefits\n(Shaver et al. 1980). Content of belief may matter less than com-\nmitment, a pattern difficult to reconcile with Bering\u2019s account.\nBering has performed an invaluable service by attempting to\nintegrate a disparate set of findings in support of an evolutionary\naccount of why human beings seem so drawn to belief in souls.\nIndeed, it is easy to get caught up in finding other patterns\nconsistent with his view (e.g., the transformation of Buddhism\nover the centuries from an atheistic, non-agentistic religion in\nits original form to a system heavily populated with souls and\nspirits in many of its more modern forms; see Livingston 2005).\nBy making the case so forcefully, he compels us all to think\nmore carefully and in greater detail about how to account for\nthe phenomena he describes. Some reformulation of existing\ntheory is clearly needed, but for the present, cultural adaptation-\nism grounded in evolved general purpose cognitive systems\nrepresents a viable alternative to his account. Among the\nvirtues of this alternative is that it more readily explains\nwidespread and increasing rates of disbelief, as well as the folk\npsychology of souls.\nBeliefs in afterlife as a by-product of\npersistence judgments\nGeorge E.

However, we\npropose a more general account rooted in how people trace ordinary\nobjects over time. Tracking identity involves attending to the causal\nhistory of an object, a process that may implicate hidden mechanisms.\nWe discuss experiments in which participants exhibit the same\n\u201csupernatural\u201d beliefs when reasoning about the fates of cups and\nautomobiles as those exhibited by Bering\u2019s participants when reasoning\nabout spirits.\nThe central claim of Bering\u2019s thought-provoking target article is\nthat evolution has produced a dedicated cognitive system to\nsupport illusory beliefs in a soul \u2013 a psychological self that\npersists after the physical body has ceased to exist. Here we\nsuggest, instead, that a more general and mundane cognitive pro-\ncess \u2013 one needed to track individuals over time \u2013 may account\nfor belief in the survival of these individuals after death.\nTo conceive of any individual requires the ability to identify it\nas the same entity over time and place. Often, such tracking must\noccur through interruptions (e.g., occlusion, lapses of attention,\nor sleep), changes in appearance (e.g., a child growing into an\nadult), or feature instabilities (e.g., a cloud changing shape).\nHere we focus on how people reason about the persistence of\nobjects \u2013 more formally, how people decide that a description\nof an object at one time t0 belongs to the same object as does a\ndescription at another time t1 (for a review of the way the\nvisual system makes similar judgments, see Scholl 2001).\nMost philosophers agree that causal factors play a role in\nobject persistence (Nozick 1981; Parfit 1984). Based on these\naccounts, we have recently proposed a cognitive theory that\nspecifies the role of causality in judgments of identity over time\n(Rips et al. 2006). According to this Causal Continuer account,\ntwo descriptions belong to the same object if (a) the object at\nt1 is among those that are causally close enough to be genuine\ncontinuers of the original item, and (b) it is the closest of these\nclose-enough contenders.\nOne of the key features of the causal continuer model is\nthat changes in similarity, spatial-temporal continuity, or even\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n480 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nbasic-level category membership do not necessarily entail that an\nobject goes out of existence. For example, Blok et al. (2005)\nreport an experiment in which participants read stories about\nan individual (e.g., Jim) who has a severe traffic accident and\nmust undergo radical surgery. Participants learned that Jim\u2019s\nbrain was transplanted to a different body. On some trials, scien-\ntists placed the brain in \u201ca highly sophisticated cybernetic body,\u201d\nwhereas on others they placed it in a human body that scientists\nhad grown for such emergencies. In each case, Jim\u2019s old body was\ndestroyed. The stories described the operation as successful in\nallowing the brain to control the new body, but participants\nalso learned either that Jim\u2019s memories survived the operation\nintact or did not survive. After reading the scenario, participants\nrated their agreement with each of two statements: (a) the trans-\nplant recipient is Jim after the operation, and (b) the transplant\nrecipient is a person after the operation.\nParticipants were more likely to agree that the post-op recipi-\nent was still Jim if Jim\u2019s memories were preserved. But whether\nthese memories were embodied in a human or in a robot body\nhad a much smaller effect. In contrast, agreement about\nwhether the end product was a person mainly depended on\nwhether the recipient object had a human rather than a robot\nbody, and relied less heavily on whether Jim\u2019s memories\nremained intact. This combination of effects produced the\nfinding that when Jim\u2019s memories survived in a robotic body,\nparticipants were much more likely to think that the transformed\nindividual is Jim than that the transformed individual is a person!\nThe belief that Jim persists despite a radical change in basic-level\ncategory may be analogous to the belief that there is an intuitive\ncausal continuer that shares a person\u2019s psychological character-\nistics after death \u2013 the individual is the same, yet the category\nhas changed. However, such judgments fall out of predictions\nmade by the Causal Continuer model and need not derive\nfrom a specialized cognitive system for theological beliefs, as\nBering posits.\nBering claims that the evolutionary rationale for such an innate\ntheological system was to tame the self so that it became \u201cless\nlikely to engage in acts that, if publicly exposed and harmful to\none\u2019s social reputation, seriously impaired genetic fitness\u201d\n(sect. 5, para. 1). This system should therefore apply with particu-\nlar force to people. Similarly, as Bering notes, other theories\nhypothesize that the concepts of person and animal may\npromote supernatural beliefs because these concepts \u201cact as\nflypaper for salient, \u2018counterintuitive\u2019 cases\u201d (sect. 2.3, para. 3)\n(e.g., Atran & Norenzayan 2004; Barrett 2000; Sperber &\nHirschfeld 2004). Beliefs about the persistence of individual\nobjects, however, are clearly not limited to persons or animals\nand are not necessarily counterintuitive or supernatural. Thus,\nto determine whether causal identity mechanisms provide a\nbetter account than a special theological one, it is important to\nconsider cases involving nonpersons. For example, do we\nobserve similar patterns of judgments with artifacts as those we\nfound with people like Jim?\nIn a second study, Blok et al. (2005) told participants about a\nsci-fi \u201ctransporter\u201d that was capable of dividing an object into\nits most basic particles (a device that surely would have stirred\nthe interest of any Star Trek fan). Once disassembled, the par-\nticles were sent through a \u201cparticle pipeline\u201d and then reas-\nsembled on the other end. The one catch to the transporter\nwas that sometimes there was a glitch \u2013 occasionally the reas-\nsembled product came out looking like a different type of\nobject. For example, a car might turn out to resemble a boat. Par-\nticipants read about transformations involving both living kinds\nand artifacts (e.g., Jim\u2019s cat \u201cNancy,\u201d or Jim\u2019s car \u201cRustbucket\u201d).\nAfter reading each scenario, participants rated their agreement\nwith two statements: (a) the object is a [car] after the transform-\nation, (b) the object is [Rustbucket] after the transformation.\nRelevant to the present discussion, we observed a pattern of\njudgments similar to those of the person experiment described\nabove. For both animals and artifacts, when the transformed\nitem had the appearance of a different (but neighboring) cat-\negory, ratings of category membership were reduced to a\ngreater extent than were ratings of individual persistence. For\ninstance, when participants were told that the car Rustbucket\nwas sent through the transporter and reconfigured to resemble\na boat, people lowered their agreement ratings more to the state-\nment that it was still a car than to the statement that it was still\nRustbucket. Thus, belief in the persistence of individuals\nthrough radical changes in kind is not restricted to persons and\nneed not include the notion of a soul. At least for some partici-\npants, it is more likely that Rustbucket is \u201creincarnated\u201d as a\nboat than that Rustbucket ceases to exist when it ceases to be a\ncar. As a perhaps more ecologically valid example, some cultures\nburied their dead with treasured artifacts (e.g., the Egyptians\nor Mayans). Though obviously these artifacts (eventually)\ndecompose along with the body, such practices are consistent\nwith the idea that artifacts \u201csurvive\u201d death in the same manner\nas persons.\nIn sum, we suggest that general cognitive processes \u2013\nprocesses dedicated to keeping track of individuals across time\nand transformation \u2013 may account for beliefs in an afterlife.\nReligious and supernatural dogmas no doubt serve to enhance\nthe richness of such beliefs. They may be responsible for the\nidea that deceased individuals live in a heaven populated with\nloved ones. But the basic process of inferring the existence of\nindividuals after death may be a natural consequence of everyday\nstrategies for tracking these individuals. The \u201cillusory\u201d aspect of\nbelief in an afterlife may result simply from the believers\u2019 lack\nof knowledge about what is, in fact, a fairly sophisticated\nidea: that a person\u2019s psychological characteristics depend on\nbodily processes and therefore come to a halt when these\nprocesses do.\nIf this is correct, there is no need to posit a special purpose\ncognitive system to explain belief in a soul. Nor is there a need\nto trace such beliefs to a mechanism that has evolved in order\nto shape moral conduct. Bering could argue that object tracking\nis just another cognitive feature that evolution has \u201cset to work\non\u201d to produce a system of hardwired theological beliefs. But if\nobject tracking is the cause of belief in a soul, then the theological\nsystem seems to have little work to do, and, like the soul itself,\nthere is correspondingly little reason to think that it exists.\nDo children think of the self as the soul?\nShaun Nichols\nDepartment of Philosophy, University of Arizona, Tucson AZ 85721.\nsbn@email.arizona.edu\nAbstract: Bering\u2019s work provides new insight into the child\u2019s concept of\nthe self. For his results indicate that children don\u2019t regard bodily identity\nas required for identity of self across time. Bering\u2019s methodology for\ninvestigating afterlife beliefs might also be exploited to explore the\nextent to which children think that psychological similarity is required\nfor sameness of self.\nJesse Bering\u2019s delightful research indicates that the belief in an\nafterlife is quite natural for children. The work also has import-\nant, but largely unnoticed, lessons on the child\u2019s concept of the\nself. The results provide some evidence for, and a methodology\nfor exploring further, the hypothesis that children think of the\nself as the soul.\nOne central tenet of the traditional view that the self is the soul\nis that the self is not the body. Surprisingly, earlier developmental\nwork on the child\u2019s concept of self has suggested that children\nidentify the self primarily with bodily features. For example,\nwhen young children were asked \u201cWhat will not change about\nyourself when you grow up?\u201d, 7-year-olds tended to refer to phys-\nical characteristics (e.g., hair color) and only rarely referred to\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 481\npsychological characteristics (Mohr 1978, p. 428). Indeed, one\nprominent view has been that young children have only a\n\u201cphysicalistic\u201d conception of the self (e.g., Montemayor &\nEisen 1977; Selman 1980). Bering\u2019s results provide the antidote\nto this view. In Bering\u2019s experiments, children tend to say\nthat Brown Mouse is still hungry and still thinking about\nMr. Alligator, despite the fact that Brown Mouse\u2019s body has\nbeen destroyed. This provides new evidence that children have\na concept of self that is not identified with physical, bodily fea-\ntures. For it\u2019s natural to interpret the children as claiming that\nBrown Mouse \u2013 the same individual \u2013 persists after the destruc-\ntion of his body. This indicates that children don\u2019t regard bodily\nidentity as required for personal identity. The children seem to\nthink that the same self persists across destruction of the body.\nA second central tenet of the soul view is that the self can\u2019t be\nidentified with a set of memories, thoughts, or other psychologi-\ncal states. Thomas Reid expresses the point with characteristic\ndirectness: \u201cWhatever this self may be, it is something which\nthinks, and deliberates, and resolves, and acts, and suffers. I\nam not thought, I am not action, I am not feeling; I am something\nthat thinks, and acts, and suffers\u201d (Reid 1785\/1969, p. 341).\nPsychological states change constantly, and so they seem too\nfickle to be the basis for an enduring self. Rather, soul theorists\nmaintain that the self is the thing that has the capacity for\npsychological states, regardless of the particular psychological\nstates it happens to have. A soul theorist maintains that it is\nbecause the self endures that it is possible for the psychological\nstates to persevere.\nBering\u2019s experiments do not tell us whether children\u2019s views of\nthe self coincide with this second tenet of the soul view. For the\nexperiments do not explore whether children would maintain\nthat Brown Mouse can continue to exist even if he loses his\ndistinctive psychological states. However, Bering has given us\nthe most promising methodology to date for exploring this\nquestion. We can use his methodology to examine the extent to\nwhich children think that psychological similarity is required\nfor personal identity. This might be done with two changes to\nBering\u2019s design. First, one would need to ask exclusively about\npsychological capacities rather than psychological states. In\nBering and Bjorklund (2004), some questions are about the\nspecific psychological states that Brown Mouse had before he\ngot eaten. For instance, children are asked of Brown Mouse,\n\u201cIs he still thirsty?\u201d and \u201cIs he still thinking about Mr. Alligator?\u201d\nTo show that children\u2019s views cohere with the second tenet of the\nsoul view, we would have to ask only about capacities, like, \u201cWill\nBrown Mouse ever think again?\u201d The second change is more\nchallenging \u2013 we would need to specify that after Brown\nMouse is eaten, there will no longer be anyone who has the par-\nticular psychological states that Brown Mouse had. For instance,\nwe might explicitly state that no one will ever remember the\nthings that Brown Mouse did. If children still tend to maintain\nthat Brown Mouse will think and feel again, then this would\nprovide evidence that children\u2019s notion of the self also follows\nthe second tenet of the soul view.\nThere is yet a third tenet of the traditional soul view \u2013 that the\nsoul is an immaterial substance. It is natural to think of this third\ntenet as providing a story about the metaphysical ground of the\ncapacity to have psychological states. Bering\u2019s data do not show\nthat this tenet is reflected in the child\u2019s view of the self, nor\ndoes he suggest otherwise. I think it unlikely that children\nnaturally have opinions on such rarefied issues in metaphysics.\nRather, the idea that there is an immaterial substance underlying\nour psychological states is most likely an intellectual innovation\nthat has become part of the culture in major religious and philo-\nsophical traditions. But if children find it intuitive that the self\ncan survive the death of the body and the radical disruption of\npsychological states, this would go some distance to explaining\nwhy the doctrine that the self is an immaterial substance has\nachieved such cultural prominence.\nThe Godfather of soul\nJesse Preston,a Kurt Gray,b and Daniel M.

Belief in souls arises in part from\nthe experience of conscious will, a compelling feeling of personal\ncausation that accompanies almost every action we take, and suggests\nthat an immaterial self is in charge of the physical body.\nWhy is it useful to think we have souls? Jesse Bering would have\nus believe that the concept of a soul is derived from evolutionary\npressures of several kinds. In his view, the soul may arise because\nwe are enamored of the idea of agents, and we overextend and\nembellish this idea to the point of perceiving people as having\nessences that persist after death \u2013 if not also existing prelife.\nFrom Bering\u2019s perspective, a soul is a construction we place on\nothers. But what of the soul we know the best \u2013 our own?\nBering\u2019s approach offers no special status to our own souls\nbecause it overlooks the experience of human agency. One key\nuse of the idea of a soul is to explain the unfathomable source\nof our own ability to do things merely by wanting them. The\nsoul is a way of understanding the experience of conscious will.\nThink for a minute of the magic of agency. You may not be able\nto create world peace just by willing it, but there are a remarkable\nnumber of things you can do nonetheless. You can open a soda\ncan, lift it up, and toast Bering \u2013 all through some wildly super-\nnatural procedure whereby the things you desire just go ahead\nand happen! And how do you know that you did this? True,\nthere are a number of cues a person could use to sleuth out per-\nsonal responsibility for action. But for the most part, conscious\nwill is experienced as an authorship emotion rather than a\nreasoned deduction. We think we possess free will because it\nfeels like we do. Feelings of personal causation are indicated\nby certain cues present around the time of an action, like visual\nfeedback, and physical feedback from the body (Wegner &\nSparrow 2004).\nPerhaps most essential to the experience of will is the connec-\ntion between thoughts and action. You find yourself thinking\nabout eating lunch, then lo and behold you find yourself down\nat the diner ordering a cheeseburger. What else could have\ncaused this, if not your own free will? According to the theory\nof apparent mental causation, the experience of will arises\nwhen we are aware of some thought about the action just\nbefore it happens, and the action cannot be readily connected\nto some other cause (Wegner 2004). Ordering the burger feels\nlike a freely willed act if you were just thinking about cheesebur-\ngers and their deliciousness, but less so if the cheeseburger\noption was just recommended by your pushy waiter.\nSeveral studies conducted in our laboratory suggest that these\nthree principles of priority, consistency, and exclusivity create the\nfeeling of conscious will over actions, even if actions are not truly\nself-caused. In a study modelled after the Ouija board, people felt\nmore control over the movements of the disk when given a\npreview where it was about to go, and if this preview occurred\njust before the action (Wegner & Wheatley 1999, see also Aarts\net al. 2005). Feelings of conscious will are attenuated, however,\nwhen there are other competing forces or agents that might be\nresponsible for the action. For example, people feel more respon-\nsibility if they are subliminally primed to think of the self just\nbefore an action, but when primed with the identity of other\nagents, feelings of responsibility decline (Dijksterhuis et al.,\nunder review). These cues are so persuasive that they can\ncreate feelings of conscious will over actions clearly beyond\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n482 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\npersonal control, including controlling the actions of others\n(Wegner et al. 2004) and the ability to enact actions at a distance\n(Pronin et al. 2006).\nThe feeling of conscious will is an inescapable part of life, and\nthe experience is so compelling it is hard to imagine that it may be\njust an illusion. Conscious will is not only an essential component\nto the concept of souls, but the experience can also help explain\nwhy souls have their ethereal quality. As Bering points out, belief\nin souls stems in part from the inability to reconcile how mind\narises from body (the hard problem of consciousness). Although\nwe have a pretty good understanding of how the heart, lungs,\nstomach, and other organs function, when trying to comprehend\nhow the brain thinks we are still left scratching our heads. The\nexperience of will presents a particularly tricky question in this\npuzzle. Agents are seen as first causes, or uncaused causes \u2013 the\norigin and author of action. Discussions of the function of an\nauthorship emotion for physical action point to the need for a\ncontroller of action, an internal operator who guides our\ndecisions (e.g., see Wegner 2005). But if the brain is the source\nof cognition, then how does the thinker direct the thinking in\none direction or another? Even if we thought we could pin\ndown the location of the internal operator in the brain, we\nwould still need to explain the controller itself. The popular sol-\nution to the search for free will is that the brain is not the ultimate\nsource of thinking, but there is some nonmaterial self \u2013 the\nsoul \u2013 that somehow operates to control the body.\nThe pervasive belief in an afterlife is possible because of this\nmind\u2013body division. And wherever the soul goes, it brings free\nwill with it. Indeed, the experience of free will is often included\nin the folk understanding of the moment of death: Death occurs\nwhen one is ready to die, loses the will to live, or chooses to go\ninto the light. Bering suggests that belief in an afterlife results\nin part because we don\u2019t know what it is like to be dead. We\nmay also be unable to fathom the absence of will. It is difficult\nto imagine that such a potent force could just dissolve into\nnothingness. After all its majesty and magic, surely conscious\nwill cannot be just snuffed out of existence, at least not without\nits permission.

Endemic and cultural are\noverlapping, not exclusive categories. It is also difficult to see why\nreasoning about the dead would require a specific cognitive mechanism.\nBering presents no clear evidence for the claim that the postulated\nmechanism is an adaptation.\nBering argues that his theoretical framework is in some respect\nmore plausible than the \u201cstandard model\u201d (Boyer 2005) in the\ncognitive science of religion (e.g., Bering 2002a; 2003a). He\nclaims that the \u201ccultural epidemiologists\u201d regard religious con-\ncepts as entirely explicit in nature and as \u201csocially acquired\u201d\nor being \u201cgenerated by culture\u201d (Bering 2002a, p. 293). Bering\n(2002a; 2003a), however, thinks that ghost concepts are\n\u201cendemic\u201d or \u201cinnate,\u201d not something learned from others. The\n\u201ccentral thesis\u201d of the target article is that an organized cognitive\nsystem, dedicated to form illusory representations of psychologi-\ncal immortality and symbolic meaning, evolved in response to the\nunique selective pressures of the human social environment.\nBering raises an important question about religion and\nadaptation, although his nativist claim is somewhat problematic.\nHe argues that specific afterlife beliefs are not \u201cdirect products\u201d\nof natural selection; what has been selected for is \u201can intuitive\npattern of reasoning\u201d that does not hinge on the presence of\nexplicit religious concepts. Bering thus makes a distinction\nbetween explicit religious concepts learned from culture and\ninnate patterns of reasoning. He has previously argued that\n\u201cthe very concept [of a ghost] itself, has natural foundations in\nthe human mind,\u201d asking whether it might be possible that\n\u201cthe general idea of an afterlife is not so much implanted in\npeople\u2019s heads by way of \u2018exposure\u2019 to counterintuitive tales,\nas it is already present\u201d in human cognitive structures (Bering\n2002a, p. 269).\nThis line of reasoning is also present in the target article.\nBering argues that Boyer (2001), Pyysia\u00a8inen (2001), Atran\n(2002), and Sperber and Hirschfeld (2004) approach religion as\na (fuzzy) set of ideas that survive in cultural transmission\nbecause they effectively parasitize evolved cognitive structures.\nThese \u201cepidemiologists\u201d are not interested in how \u201ca represen-\ntational bias for envisioning personal immortality\u201d has \u201cimpacted\nthe net genetic fitness of individual humans in ancestral\nenvironments.\u201d\nThere is, however, a conceptual confusion involved in Bering\u2019s\nway of distinguishing his approach from the standard model.\nBarrett (2003), Boyer (2003a), and myself (Pyysia\u00a8inen 2003)\npointed out three years ago that Bering\u2019s dichotomy between\nendemic and cultural concepts is misconceived; epidemiologists\ndo not regard culture as a set of \u201centirely explicit\u201d concepts\nthat are simply learned, irrespective of implicit biases. Concepts\ncannot be divided into two mutually exclusive classes: those we\nare born with and those we learn from others. There are only\nconcepts represented in mind; some of them are communicated\nto others and thus may become widespread. A representation is\ncultural to the extent that it is represented by many persons\nand is preserved in various versions over time, no matter what\nits origins are.\nAccording to Barrett (2003), nativists such as Bering focus on\nhow the cognitive machinery of individuals \u201cproduces\u201d intuitive\nideas and behaviors that may then receive augmentation from\nexplicit ideas learned from culture. The epidemiologists, in\nturn, are not necessarily interested in the origins of concepts\nand beliefs; instead, they try to explain the distribution of rep-\nresentations in populations. Widespread ideas are typically\nsuch that they are easily adopted because it is possible to\nenrich them by one\u2019s intuitions. Thus, there need not be a contra-\ndiction between nativism and epidemiology.\nThe actual difference between Bering and the standard model\nis in that Bering presupposes a pattern of reasoning dedicated\nspecifically to making inferences about afterlife. Whereas\nBoyer thinks that beliefs about dead agents are mediated by\npsychological adaptations that enable us to reason about agents\nin general, Bering holds that reasoning about dead agents is\nbased on a task-specific adaptation (Boyer & Barrett 2005;\ncf. Stone & Gerrans 2006).\nBy the same token, Bering is committed to an adaptationist\nview of religion, whereas in the standard model religion is an\nevolutionary by-product (see Atran 2002; Bulbulia 2004). All\nideas of counterintuitive agents, such as ghosts, gods, and ances-\ntors are represented using the normal mechanisms of agent\nrepresentation, adding one minor modification or \u201ctweak\u201d to an\nintuitive representation (Boyer 2003b). No specific mechanisms\nare needed to mediate different types of agent representations.\nSurprisingly, Bering also suggests that interactions with\nimagined dead agents might be cases of \u201coff-line\u201d social cognition\nin the sense that the dead are represented as absent but existing\npersons. This, however, implies that there is no specific mechan-\nism for reasoning about dead agents. The specificity of the \u201cintui-\ntive pattern\u201d has to be only in its domain of application, not in the\nmechanism itself.\nIf this is so, then we also have to look for adaptations in agent\ndetection and theory of mind in general, not in special concepts\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 483\nof dead agents. The weakest part of Bering\u2019s contribution is\nprecisely his evolutionary speculations. It is not much of an\nargument to say that supernatural illusions may have had\nfitness-enhancing effects, and that if this is so, then they might\nrepresent a specific cognitive adaptation (see Sterelny 2003).\nBering hints at the problem of the evolution of cooperation but\ndoes not really explore it (see Axelrod 1990; Nowak & Sigmund\n1994; 2005; Nowak et al. 2004; Richerson & Boyd 2005).\nSaying that the ability to entertain ideas about supernatural\nagents \u201cmight have led\u201d our ancestors to accept the moral\nnorms of their community raises more questions than it solves\n(see Boyer 2004; MacIntyre 2004; Pyysia\u00a8inen 2006). As I see it,\nBering\u2019s ingenious experimental work is best interpreted within\nthe standard model. Developing evolutionary arguments about\nmorality and cooperation would require a more rigorous\nmethodology.\nAn unconstrained mind: Explaining belief\nin the afterlife\nPhilip Robbinsa and Anthony I.

This explanation suffers from some difficulties. First,\nit implies the existence of a corresponding belief in the \u201cbeforelife.\u201d\nSecond, a simpler explanation will suffice. Rather than appeal to\nconstraints on our thoughts about death, we suggest that belief in the\nafterlife can be better explained by the lack of such constraints.\nWhy do so many people believe in life after death? According to\nBering\u2019s simulation constraint hypothesis, the common-sense\nbelief in the afterlife originates in part from the difficulty of men-\ntally simulating a scenario in which one does not exist. Such an\nact of simulation is difficult because it invites one to imagine\nwhat it would be like (in the technical sense of \u201cwhat it is like,\u201d\nfrom Nagel 1974) not to exist \u2013 an impossible feat. Because\none cannot imagine what it would be like to be dead by imagining\nwhat it would be like not to exist, one imagines instead what it\nwould be like to exist apart from one\u2019s body. This leads to the\nbelief in psychological persistence after physical death.\nIf the simulation constraint hypothesis is correct, then, we\nbelieve in life after death because we cannot imagine ceasing\nto exist after death. But it is no easier to imagine one\u2019s nonexis-\ntence after death than it is to imagine one\u2019s nonexistence\nbefore the start of bodily life (say, before conception). What\nthe simulation constraint hypothesis predicts, then, is belief\nin a stronger form of psychological immortality than the one\nBering considers, namely, belief in the afterlife coupled with\nbelief in the \u201cbeforelife.\u201d The question is: Do these two beliefs\nhave equal currency?\nThis is an empirical question, and answering it will require\ncareful experimental investigation, using methods similar to\nthose described in the target article. This investigation is\nongoing (Bering, personal communication). But there is reason\nto suspect that the answer to the question is no. There appears\nto be a far greater prevalence of belief in the persistence of the\nsoul after bodily death relative to belief in the preexistence of\nthe soul before bodily life.\nIn historical and contemporary Christianity, for example, the\ndominant views of the soul are creationism and traducianism.\nAccording to these views, the soul originates at the moment of\nconception, either by a creative act of God (as in creationism)\nor by generation from the souls of one\u2019s parents (as in\ntraducianism). Thus, both creationists and traducianists deny\nthat the soul exists prior to conception. Though some Christian\nsects, such as Mormonism, insist on the preexistence of the\nsoul relative to conception, this is very much a minority view in\nChristian theology, both past and present. The same is true of\nJudaism and Islam. By contrast, belief in the continuing existence\nof the soul after death is shared by most major world religions,\nincluding Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. While this discre-\npancy might be explained in other ways, it suggests that belief\nin the afterlife and belief in the beforelife are not equally at\nhome in common sense. If that turns out to be true, the simu-\nlation constraint hypothesis is in trouble.\nFortunately, we can explain the common-sense belief in life\nafter death just as well without appealing to the idea of\nconstraints on simulation. Instead, we can appeal to the relative\nabsence of such constraints. In the target article, Bering\nhimself gestures towards the explanation we have in mind:\n\u201c[T]he nature of the body\u2019s role in producing the subjective\nexperiences of emotions, desires, and beliefs seems not as\namenable to children\u2019s scientific theories of dead minds\n(or, indeed, even to adults\u2019 formulation of scientific theories\nregarding phenomenal consciousness and the brain, e.g.,\nqualia)\u201d (sect. 2.1, para. 6).\nHere\u2019s how the story goes in a bit more detail. Children and\nadults alike tend to think of the mind in general \u2013 and phenom-\nenal consciousness in particular \u2013 in terms that are sharply dis-\ntinct from, and even cognitively opposed to, the terms in which\nthey think of physical-causal mechanisms such as the brain and\nother parts of the body (Robbins & Jack 2006; see also Bloom\n2004). Those links between the mental and physical that we do\nunderstand to exist are few and far between, and they apply\nonly to a limited range of mental states (Bering & Bjorklund\n2004). Hence, our thoughts about the physical do little to\nconstrain our thoughts about the mental.\nIn particular, the thought that our body will give out at some\npoint in the future does not lead us to think that our mind will\ndo the same. Indeed, our cognitive architecture may dispose us\nto reach the opposite conclusion. The very fact that the mental\nand the physical seem so starkly different may lead us to\nbelieve in mind\u2013body dualism. It\u2019s a short step from belief in\ndualism to the belief that at least some psychological states,\nsuch as conscious thoughts and feelings (which seem terminally\nresistant to causal-mechanical explanation; see Robbins & Jack\n2006), will persist after death.\nEvolution\u2019s lost souls\nLloyd E.

Undergraduates\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n484 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nare spooked into moral behavior by the suggestion of superna-\ntural presence. And, generally, people are \u201cintuitive theists\u201d\nwho find teleology in the natural world and who find intelligent\ndesign in their personal lives.\nThe target article is clear also about the question raised by the\nfacts:\n[I]f God does not exist, then the unique self (i.e., the individual \u201csoul\u201d\nof any given person) cannot be the product of intelligent design; rather,\nit is simply the end product of standard machinations of genetic and\nenvironmental recombination. [. . .] The task remains for cognitive\nscientists to determine why the teleological position is so frequently\nadopted, and prospers so vehemently, over the mechanistic alternative.\nThe human mind cannot seem to easily accommodate itself to a\ngodless, evolutionary canon when it comes to the self\u2019s existence.\n(target article, sect. 3)\nAnd the target article is clear about its reckoning of this\nquestion. Human thinking suffers three evolved errors: Type I\nerrors in reasoning about the afterlife, teleo-functional errors\nleading to belief in the soul\u2019s intelligent design, and theory of\nmind errors leading to belief in supernatural causes. These\nerrors culminate in an illusion that the self is related to a super-\nnatural creator and has a moral obligation to that creator. And\nthese evolved errors and illusions explain why the \u201cteleological\nposition\u201d prospers and thereby why the folk psychology of souls\ntakes the form it does.\nAlthough clear, the target article presumes everything by its\nquestion. On the premises that God does not exist and the soul\nis not an intelligent design, the article asks how evolution pro-\nduced appearances to the contrary. These premises are not state-\nments of scientific fact, but are statements of secular faith. Why\nthese premises? What is the evidence and argument for them?\nAnd what is the cost in accepting them? More to the point,\nwhat if God does exist and the soul is an intelligent design?\nHow dramatically the question changes \u2013 from being about\nerror and illusion to being about Natural Law, from being\nabout how people prosper in spite of themselves to being about\nhow they prosper in the light and love of God. What the target\narticle describes as the na\u0131\u00a8ve misapprehension of the child\nbecomes the wisdom of the child.\nFrom its unjustified premises, the target article comes to a\nfalse conclusion. Evolutionary science cannot explain why man\nthinks what he does. Evolutionary science is about matter, not\nabout meaning. It explains the origin, proliferation, and disap-\npearance of material forms (e.g., physical traits, abilities, disposi-\ntions), but not of mental forms (e.g., ideas, beliefs, feelings) (see\nAtran 2002). The latter are not material survivals, but are imma-\nterial creations. This is plain in the article\u2019s own ideas about the\n\u201cerrors\u201d of religious thinking. Are these ideas also evolved? And if\nso, how are they selected alongside the ideas they rule out?\nFurthermore, evolutionary science is about natural objects, not\nabout man. It misunderstands man when it traces his every\nfeature, including those that are unique, to his physical being\n(e.g., if man is the only animal that can think creatively using\nsymbols, it is because he has an enlarged brain with a prominent\ncerebrum). By confining man to his physical capacities, evol-\nutionary science fails to account for his unique and creative use\nof these capacities. It leaves to question why he uses his\ncapacities as he does and why animals that share many of these\ncapacities (e.g., the chimpanzee) do not use them the same\nway. Why does man reason? Why does man make art? Why\ndoes man seek life in God? In a word, evolutionary science\nfails to explain man qua man.\nThis, finally and ironically, is the loud unspoken message of the\narticle:\n[J]ust as we can close our eyes to prevent light from being converted\ninto neural signals, science may provide a minority (i.e., nonbelievers)\nwith the armamentarium to close their eyes to the supernatural.\n(sect. 3, para. 9)\nTo see man with eyes open \u2013 to see him as he is \u2013 is to\nconceive him differently. It is to see him, not in the blinkered\nmetaphysic of evolutionary science, but in the revealing\nmetaphysic of Divine creation (Sandelands 2005). It is to see\nhim, not as an object of the natural world, but as a creative\nbeing in God. It is to see him as a supernatural being, a\ngenuine soul. Only when seen in this second way \u2013 a way well-\ndescribed by the world\u2019s great faiths \u2013 can satisfactory answers\nbe found to the main questions about his life: What is a\nperson? What is society? What is freedom? What does man\nwant? And, what is the good?

Although this hypothesis\nmay be correct, it is not obviously so. Loss of consciousness (e.g.,\nwhen sleeping) is a routine feature of human experience and\napparently quite easy to conceptualize, if not to simulate. It is\nnoteworthy that adults, in our own society at least, sometimes\nimagine that children will be comforted by the idea that\ngrandma is sleeping rather than dead, not because an absence\nof consciousness is hard to convey (quite the opposite), but\nbecause a permanent absence of consciousness is alarming.\nFurther, an inclination to attribute consciousness to the dead\nwould, in itself, be inconsequential in behavioural (and thus\nevolutionary) terms. Dead agents must additionally be attributed\ncapacities that enable them to intervene in human affairs: at least\nminimally, they must not only be conscious but also have access\nto socially strategic information (e.g., being able to hear and see\nwhat mortals are saying and doing). The ethnographic record\nfurnishes abundant examples of representations of dead agents\nwhose perceptual capacities are preserved along with conscious\nbeliefs and desires, whereas representations of dead agents as\ndeaf or blind are rare or nonexistent. Thus, even if the simulation\nconstraint hypothesis proves to be correct, its impact on beha-\nviour must in turn depend on the activation of additional cogni-\ntive tools (e.g., as proposed in Barrett 2004 and Boyer 2001).\nThe Mental Continuity Hypothesis proposes that attributions\nof emotions, desires, and epistemic states to dead agents\n(\u201cmental continuity judgements\u201d) result from universal cognitive\nbiases emerging early in childhood. This hypothesis seems to be\nsupported by evidence that among American children such attri-\nbutions decrease with age, \u201cthe opposite pattern that one would\nexpect to find if the origins of such beliefs could be traced exclu-\nsively to cultural indoctrination\u201d (target article, sect. 2, para. 3). If\nthis finding proves to be robust then, to rule out \u201ccultural indoc-\ntrination\u201d and other effects of variable environments, we would\nneed to test the hypothesis across a range of cultural settings\nCommentary\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 485\n(a valuable start has been made by Harris & Gime\u00b4nez 2005 and\nAstuti, forthcoming a).\nThe Absent Presence Hypothesis proposes that our habit of\nthinking about significant others in absentia reinforces the\nillusion that they are still around after they have died. Such\nreinforcement may vary cross-culturally, however. In modern\ncomplex societies, close kin often live far apart, relying heavily\non disembodied forms of communication to maintain contact.\nBering\u2019s example of bereaved persons abortively telephoning\ntheir loved ones may best be understood in that context. In\nsmall-scale societies, including those in which our ancestors\nevolved, physical separation from significant others is\/was more\nlimited in duration and the reality of their absence after death\nperhaps less easy (momentarily) to forget. This is a potentially\ntestable hypothesis. Are accidental communication attempts\nwith the dead less frequent in small, face-to-face societies with\nlow rates of out-migration than in modern urban settings?\nThe Good Citizen Hypothesis proposes that the presumed\npresence of supernatural agents encourages prosocial behaviour\nand inhibits antisocial behaviour. The idea that supernatural\nagents reward good behaviour and punish the wicked is a recur-\nrent theme in the so-called ethical religions, but generalizes only\nwith considerable difficulty. In many Melanesian societies, for\ninstance, the ancestors are thought to incite homicidal behaviour\nby systematically undermining more natural tendencies towards\npeaceful cooperation and prosociality (Harrison 1993). A\nbroader question might be whether prosocial behaviour\nenhances reproductive success in human populations, past and\npresent, as Bering\u2019s evolutionary scheme proposes. In many\nsocieties, the cultivation of a reputation for acquisitive and\naggressive behaviour, at least among males, appears to be an\neffective strategy in accessing resources (including women).\nThe Purposeful Life Hypothesis proposes that people are cog-\nnitively predisposed to think that they were called into existence\nto serve a divine plan. This hypothesis, and the related contention\nthat suicide is an affront to God\u2019s scheme, may prove difficult to\ngeneralize cross-culturally, perhaps reflecting attitudes found\nmainly in highly individualistic cultural traditions of modern\norigin.\nThe Meaningful World Hypothesis proposes that people are\ncognitively predisposed to interpret happenings as communica-\ntively driven. A readiness to interpret unusual occurrences as\nsigns or portents initiated by supernatural agents, rather than\nas merely random and meaningless events, has been widely\nreported by ethnographers. It is not clear why such a predisposi-\ntion should be adaptive, although it could be a spandrel, a\nproduct of sign-reading capacities that evolved as an aid to track-\ning quarry, detecting predators, and grasping the communicative\nintentions of other humans (among other useful applications).\nFrom an anthropological viewpoint, Bering\u2019s arguments are\nhighly significant and warrant careful attention in future cross-\ncultural research.\nAuthor\u2019s Response\nThe cognitive science of souls: Clarifications\nand extensions of the evolutionary model\nJesse M.

Most of the\ncommentators agree that beliefs in personal immortality, in the\nintelligent design of souls, and in the symbolic meaning of\nnatural events can provide new insight into human social\nevolution. In this response I clarify and extend the evolutionary\nmodel, further emphasizing the adaptiveness of the cognitive\nsystem that underlies these beliefs.\nR1. Introduction\nOnly in the past few years has the cognitive substratum of\nreligious and supernatural experience been penetrated by\nthe precision tools of experimental science (for reviews,\nsee Atran & Norenzayan 2004; Barrett 2000; Boyer\n2001; Whitehouse 2004). Shaky hands are to be expected\nin these first attempts at scientific exploration, and some\ntrembling is also evident at places in the target article.\nBut, as Bainbridge so eloquently discusses in his com-\nmentary, picking up these tools to begin with is the hard\npart, and I am very grateful to the commentators for offer-\ning their expert hands to steady my own.\nSince the focus of most of the commentaries concerned\nthe evolutionary model and because this issue is central to\nthe theoretical framing of the target article, most of my\nresponse will be devoted to that topic, highlighting theor-\netical points in the other commentaries whenever they\nhave some bearing on the evolutionary history of a folk\npsychology of souls.\nR2. Clarifying the evolutionary model\nBy far the most frequent criticism in the commentaries\nquestioned my evolutionary model, seeking greater\nclarity and further attention to deviant cross-cultural\nexamples of religious belief systems that seemingly\nviolate the model\u2019s core assumptions. For example,\nJohnson & Nyhof protest that \u201cthe Darwinian mechan-\nisms are left completely unspecified.\u201d Pyysia\u00a8inen finds\nsimilar fault with the target article\u2019s evolutionary cast\n(\u201cThe weakest part of Bering\u2019s contribution is precisely\nhis evolutionary speculations\u201d), a concern echoed in the\nvituperative commentary by Hegde\u00b4 & Johnson, among\nothers. According to the majority of commentators who\naddressed the evolutionary issues, the explanatory frame-\nwork into which I have placed my research programme\nis flawed on several counts.\nTo recount the original argument, I claimed that three\nbasic cognitive mechanisms \u2013 those that produce illusions\nof personal immortality, of teleological authorship in\nthe design of individual souls, and of natural events\nas having symbolic meaning \u2013 formed an organized\n\u201csystem\u201d at some point in recent human evolution as a\nresult of the unique selective pressures operating in our\nsocial environment. I placed the word \u201csystem\u201d in scare\nquotes because I see these illusions as being connected\nthrough a sort of abstract, conjunctive tissue that biases\nreasoning about personal existence, not as a modular,\ntask-specific system yielding static behaviours indepen-\ndent of cultural variation (Livingston; Pyysia\u00a8inen). I\nhave never claimed that \u201creligion is innate\u201d (Bloch) or\neven that there exists \u201can evolved system dedicated to\nResponse\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n486 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nafterlife beliefs\u201d (Harris & Astuti; also Pyysia\u00a8inen). These\nare oversimplifications.\nMy evolutionary model identifies a suite of very basic\ncognitive building blocks, often but not always associated\nwith religious beliefs. If this suite indeed comprises a\ntrue psychological adaptation that motivated adaptive\nresponses under recurrent challenging conditions, then\nit should be canalized in modern humans, present in\nanyone with a normal cognitive profile (Flusberg &\nTager-Flusberg) who does not develop under extreme\nand species-atypical conditions (Evans & Wellman).\nHegde\u00b4 & Johnson conflate adaptations, which have\na heritability of zero, with heritable individual\ndifferences associated with adaptations (see Tooby &\nCosmides 1992, pp. 122\u201331), presumably those that\nwould contribute to varying degrees of religiosity in\nmodern humans.\nR2.1. The fact that there may be reputation maintenance\nmechanisms other than those entailed by the folk\npsychology of souls presents no difficulties for my\nevolutionary model\nSeveral commentaries suggested that my evolutionary\nmodel was flawed because there are other psychological\nmechanisms, none of which involve souls or supernatural\nagents or seeing signs in natural events, which serve\na reputation maintenance function (Beit-Hallahmi;\nBoyer; Ferrari; Gjersoe & Hood; Greenberg,\nSullivan, Kosloff, & Solomon [Greenberg et al.]).\nThis is a point elaborated by Boyer, who, after\nsummarizing several alternative mechanisms that\npromote prosocial behaviours in humans, tells us that,\n\u201cAll these dispositions and processes evolved indepen-\ndently of supernatural and religious beliefs, operate in\nsimilar ways in people with or without such beliefs and\nregardless of differences in these beliefs, and recruit\ndifferent neuro-cognitive machinery from the superna-\ntural imagination.\u201d\nI do not see a conflict here. As far as I am aware, there is\nno law in natural selection theory stating that there cannot\nbe distinctly evolved mechanisms serving the same\nadaptive purpose. On the contrary, if these mechanisms\ndelivered a cumulative, buffering effect in solving a\nshared adaptive problem or \u2013 at the very least \u2013 did not\nimpede one another\u2019s functioning, evolution should\nfavour the selection of multiple adaptive designs. More-\nover, contrary to the criticisms raised by Hegde\u00b4 &\nJohnson, an evolved folk psychology of souls meets\nthe important criterion of Darwinian conservativeness\nbecause the types of existential illusions generated would\nhave emerged through a set of biases produced by\npre-existing structures. The system that I have outlined\ntherefore would not have required any substantive\nneuro-cognitive reorganization.\nSeveral commentaries discussed the role of shame in\ninhibiting normatively deviant or antisocial behaviours\n(Beit-Hallahmi; Ferrari; Gjersoe &Hood), particularly\nhow parents instill these feelings, and implied that this\nobviates the adaptive utility of belief in supernatural\nobservation or punishment. Shame, however, is usually\nexperienced after a social transgression has already\noccurred; it is the emotional aftermath of transgression\n(Tangney 2003). Although the negative affect associated\nwith this experience may serve to discourage similar\nactions in the future (see Fessler & Haley 2003;\nGilbert & McGuire 1998), and may attenuate severity of\npunishment for an offence (Gold & Weiner 2000),\nshame may not be very effective at preventing the\noccurrence of a proscribed behaviour in the first place.\nShame and observability, of course, are not mutually\nexclusive \u2013 in fact they are sister constructs. But\nbelief that one is under surveillance by supernatural\nagents, and that there are consequences for misdeeds\neven when they occur in private, may effectively deter\nsocially proscribed behaviours even in the absence of\nshame.\nR2.2. The importance of avoiding solitary incidents of\nserious transgressions must be emphasized\nAlthough reputations are mostly cumulative and can\nperhaps be formulated as an image score that people\nuse to guide their interactions with social others (e.g.,\nNowak & Sigmund 1998), a single black mark can erode\nan otherwise unbroken record of altruistic tendencies.\n\u201cWords are wolves,\u201d according to Jean Genet. Language\nwould have enabled our ancestors to essentialize others\ninto social category memberships through the heuristics\nof emotionally loaded words. One need only consider\nhow socially powerful are terms such as \u201crapist,\u201d \u201cpaedo-\nphile,\u201d \u201cthief,\u201d \u201cmurderer,\u201d \u201cslut,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cchild abuser,\u201d\nor, recently, \u201cterrorist,\u201d to see the hazards of a publicly\nrevealed, solitary moral breach from the gene\u2019s point\nof view.1\nNemoroff and Rozin\u2019s (1994) findings of moral conta-\ngion (i.e., emotional aversion to physical objects such as\nclothing that have been in contact with representatives\nof such derogated social categories) may be seen as evi-\ndence of this type of negative essentialism (Gjersoe &\nHood). Any public distancing from socially repudiated\nothers would serve to advertise a personal commitment\nto in-group norms \u2013 that is, that one is not like the dero-\ngated individual. The sociologist Erving Goffman (1963)\nnoted that people who are wanted on criminal warrants\nwere once referred to as \u201chaving smallpox\u201d and their crim-\ninal disease was said to be catching. Merely being seen\nwith them could lead to arrest on suspicion.\nThe folk psychology of souls (which at its core constitu-\ntes a social relationship between the self and supernatural\nagents) would have helped our ancestors to censor selfish\ndecisions associated with others judging them as being\nessentially bad and\/or morally undesirable (and therefore\nto avoid the negative reproductive consequences of this\nlabelling). This was particularly the case in situations\nwhere people were strongly tempted by selfish desires\nand underestimated the likelihood of detection by other\nin-group members. Miscalculating the odds of social\nexposure for certain behaviours would have had calami-\ntous effects on reputation and, therefore, on genetic\nfitness. The folk psychology of souls provided adaptive illu-\nsions of watchful supernatural agents that helped to coun-\nteract these dangerous miscalculations. These illusions\ninvolved seeing supernatural agent(s) as being emotionally\ninvested in the self\u2019s existence, as sharing (or at least\nunderstanding) the in-group\u2019s moral values, and as com-\nmunicating their attitudes and opinions about the self\nthrough the occurrence of natural events and biographical\nResponse\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 487\nexperiences (Bering 2002b; Bering & Johnson 2005;\nJohnson & Bering 2006). Natural events and biographical\nexperiences were perceived as the \u201cevidence\u201d that such\nsupernatural agents were real (cf. Bullot) and were\ncapable of punishing and rewarding social behaviours,\neither in this life or in the hereafter.\nR2.3. Experimental findings demonstrate social\nsensitivity to being observed\nBeliefs in watchful supernatural agents appear to militate\nagainst the psychological state of deindividuation, which\noccurs whenever \u201cindividuals are not seen or paid atten-\ntion to as individuals\u201d (Festinger et al. 1952, p. 382).\nFestinger and his colleagues described how deindividua-\ntion is strongly associated with social disinhibition and\nloss of inner restraints. Numerous laboratory experiments\nhave in fact shown that participants who believe that they\nare making decisions under anonymous conditions tend to\nbe less altruistic, more aggressive, and more punitive than\nthose who believe that their identities are known (e.g.,\nDiener et al. 1976; Ellison et al. 1995; Rehm et al. 1987;\nZimbardo 1969).\nBuilding on experimental economic games, a flurry of\nrecent studies have also provided evidence that ambient\ngaze, even when artificial, unconsciously primes prosocial\nbehaviours in human participants (Bateson et al. 2006;\nBurnham & Hare, in press; Haley & Fessler 2005; Milinski\net al. 2002; Wedekind & Braithwaite 2002). Burnham and\nHare (in press), for example, found that people made more\naltruistic decisions in a task involving allocation of scarce\nresources even when the \u201cwitness\u201d was simply an image\nof a robot with large human-like eyes. Similar results\nwere reported by Haley and Fessler (2005), from a study\nin which participants behaved more generously on a com-\nputerized task when stylized eyespots were present on the\nscreen, which the authors interpreted as evidence that\nsubtle cues concerning observability factor prominently\nin reputation management. (Gjersoe &Hood\u2019s discussion\nof Titchener\u2019s classic unseen gaze findings, where people\nbelieve they can \u201cfeel\u201d when others are looking at them\nbehind their backs, may be interpretable within this evol-\nutionary framework, as well; see also Colwell et al. 2000).\nFinally, as discussed in the target article, Bering et al.\n(2005b) found that, when left alone in a room, participants\nwho were led to believe that a ghost may be observing\nthem cheated less on a competitive task compared to\nthose who did not receive this supernatural prime.\nReal-world findings provide complementary evidence\nthat perceptions of anonymity are positively correlated\nwith antisocial behaviours. In a cross-cultural analysis of\nwarfare practices, for example, Watson (1973) discovered\nthat warriors who hid their identities before going into\nbattle were more likely to kill, mutilate, and torture than\nthose who did not. More recently, Silke (2003) found\nthat, of all sectarian violence incidents reported in North-\nern Ireland over a two-year period (1994\u20131996), paramili-\ntary members who wore masks during their offences\nattacked more people, inflicted more serious injuries,\ncommitted more acts of vandalism, and were more likely\nto threaten their victims after attacking them than parami-\nlitary members who were implicated in sectarian violence\nbut who did not hide their faces.\nR2.4. Cross-cultural variability, supernatural beliefs,\nand evolutionary dynamics\nAlthough belief in supernatural observability has not yet\nbeen targeted as a key research question in evolutionary\nmodels of religion, the ethnographic literature does\nsuggest that such beliefs feature prominently in most\nreligious systems. In Pettazzoni\u2019s (1955) cross-cultural\nanalysis of the types of attributes that are most frequently\nattributed to the gods, one recurrent and defining charac-\nteristic is the gods\u2019 deep knowing of people as unique\nindividuals (i.e., their \u201chearts and souls\u201d). In Borneo,\nthe Iban believe that \u201canyone who successfully cheats\nanother, or escapes punishment for his crimes, even\nthough he may appear to profit temporarily, ultimately\nsuffers supernatural retribution\u201d (Sandin & Sather 1980,\np. xxviii). And Malinowski (1935, p. viii) wrote that \u201cfrom\nthe study of past religions, primitive and developed, we\nshall gain the conviction . . . that every religion implies\nsome reward of virtue and the punishment of sin.\u201d Implicit\nhere is the assumption that supernatural agents who dole\nout moralistic consequences are believed also to survey\nand observe private behaviours, keeping their thumbs on\nindividuals within the group.\nCohen, Kenrick, & Li [Cohen et al.] ask whether\n\u201cvariations in beliefs in afterlife or observant spirits are\nlinked to recurrent variations in social or physical\necology\u201d (also Whitehouse; see Reynolds & Tanner\n1995). Although we do not yet have the data to answer\nthis important question, structuring the present evolution-\nary model under these (ecologically dynamic) terms may\nput into context the striking cultural diversity associated\nwith the moral dimension of supernatural beliefs. For\nexample, answering this question would potentially be\ncapable of addressing the sceptical query posed by\nGreenberg et al., who ask, \u201cIf immortality beliefs were\na simple default by-product of cognition, why would\nthese beliefs be so varied across cultures and so\ncomplex?\u201d At the moment, I agree that such variation is\ndifficult to understand, but this is due to the embryonic\nstage of data gathering in this area, not to any serious limit-\nations of the simulation constraint hypothesis or the\ngeneral evolutionary theory I have offered.\nThe commentaries reveal a wide variety of religious\nbeliefs that appear uniquely tied to specific cultures, geo-\ngraphic areas, and historical settings. Why these adaptive\nclimates give rise to particular beliefs and not others is a\nquestion for evolutionary analysis, just as Cohen et al.\nreason. For example, collective symbolic interpretations\nof disease and misfortune may serve to enculturate chil-\ndren into specific moral environments (environments that\nare themselves products of specific ecological and social\nfactors). Such symbolic interpretations offer children a\nvery clear picture of what it is that their society does not\ncondone. In their fascinating description of Cotard\u2019s\nsyndrome, Cohen & Consoli write that \u201ccollective and\ncultural significance dominates biographical experiences\n[. . .] first syphilis then AIDS symbolized the amalgam of\nflesh, punishment, sin, guilt, sexuality, and the devil.\u201d\nWe need not look at exotic cultures to see how collective\nsymbolic interpretations of natural events can influence\nmoral development. As an eight-year-old, I was panic-\nstricken that an upcoming doctor\u2019s visit, which I knew\nwould involve a routine drawing of blood, would publicly\nResponse\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n488 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nidentify me as a homosexual. I was na\u0131\u00a8ve to the medical\nfacts about how people contracted the HIV-virus, but I\nknew that AIDS could be detected in blood. I also under-\nstood that many saw AIDS as a moral condemnation of\ngay men, specifically as God\u2019s culling of homosexuals.\nWhether I personally saw such a moralistic message in\nAIDS was inconsequential for this cultural illusion to\nimpact on my decision not to divulge my sexual orien-\ntation, a decision that can be understood within fitness-\nrelated terms. Other peoples\u2019 symbolic interpretation of\nthis disease was enough to teach me that something in\nmy blood would expose me as being essentially bad,\nworthy of being shunned \u2013 and, in fact, I had such antici-\npatory anxiety about the social consequences of being\nlabelled a \u201chomosexual,\u201d that I collapsed in the waiting\nroom.\nAlthough I agree with Pyysia\u00a8inen that we are not in\na position to advance a detailed evolutionary argument\nuntil a \u201cmore rigorous methodology\u201d is developed \u2013 a\ntask that will require massive interdisciplinary collabora-\ntion \u2013 it is unclear to me how one could ever begin to\nconstruct such a methodology without first having a\ngeneral evolutionary theory capable of generating hypoth-\neses and offering an interpretive lens through which to\nview the findings. I have posited a general evolutionary\ntheory that can act as such, as a crucible for weighing com-\npeting, non-adaptationist hypotheses, something recog-\nnized by several commentators (Cohen et al.; Evans &\nWellman; Hughes; Whitehouse).\nR2.5. Absent third-party punishment is a uniquely\nhuman adaptive problem\nGjersoe & Hood comment that \u201cmany social animals also\nshow behavioural inhibition and prosocial behaviour\nwithout necessitating a specialized cognitive mechanism\nfor a belief in souls.\u201d This is not in debate. But what\nthese commentators overlook is the fact that theory of\nmind, and the concomitant emergence of declarative\nlanguage, introduced a genuinely novel adaptive problem\nin human sociality \u2013 that of absent third-party punish-\nment. In short, absent third-party punishment is any\npunishment that is administered by a person (or persons)\nwho were not present at the time of the offence, but who\nlearned about the offence through a second-hand source\n(Fehr & Fischbacher 2004). Human beings are able to\nmentally represent an absent third-party\u2019s state of ignor-\nance about the unobserved event and are strategically\nmotivated \u2013 and emotionally driven \u2013 to disclose their\nvictimization to these na\u0131\u00a8ve third parties through declara-\ntive language. This is, in fact, the very basis of all criminal\njustice systems, no matter how informal.\nWhat is unique about human sociality is that anybody\nwho witnesses a social event is a carrier of strategic infor-\nmation who can then transmit that information to other\nminds, over great spans of time and geographical dis-\ntances. \u201cSeeing\u201d therefore took on new meaning for\nhuman beings, the only species for which, given these\nsocial cognitive verities, short-term selfish gains were\ntraded in for long-term reputation gains. According to\nJohnson (2005, p. 414), \u201cInformation about person A\ncould propagate via person B to person C, D, E, and so\non . . . even if person B and C do not care, it may not be\nuntil person Z hears the news, or until enough people\nhear the news, or until some authority hears the news,\nperhaps weeks later, that punishment will come.\u201d Given\nthe calamitous effects a mired reputation could have on\nthe actor\u2019s genetic fitness (through punitive tactics such\nas castigation, ostracism, exclusion, group expulsion, or\neven execution), the presence of nearly any watchful\nagent, human or supernatural, became capable of influen-\ncing behavioural decision-making.2\nR2.6. Selective pressures for solutions to the adaptive\nproblem were intense\nIt is impossible to overstate how strongly the third-party\npunishment problem would have influenced the course\nof human social evolution. This is especially evident\nwhen one considers the relatively low degree of privacy\nafforded to our ancestors, who lived in small-scale\ngossipy societies of only 120 to 150 individuals (Dunbar\n& Spoors 1995). In the environment of evolutionary adapt-\nedness, individuals would have been unable to easily emi-\ngrate to new social groups and to \u201cstart over\u201d if they spoilt\ntheir reputation in their natal group (a strategy of socio-\npaths in modern societies; Mealey 1995).3\nNotice that inclusive fitness is also likely to be negatively\nimpacted by a spoiled public identity because of a\nsanguineous bias, stigma attached to the biological kin of\nthe individual whose reputation is impugned through\ntransgression (e.g., see May 2000 for stigma effects on\nmurderers\u2019 relatives). This means that third-party punish-\nment does not necessarily end at death. These inclusive\nfitness issues concerning the effects of reputation on bio-\nlogical kin also mean, in principle, that effectively mana-\nging reputation is a more pressing evolutionary problem\nthan mitigating existential anxieties through symbolic\nimmortality (Greenberg et al.). Indeed, many of the\nextensive findings from the Terror Management Theory\nliterature can be understood in these terms. If one is\nreminded of his own inevitable death, better for his\nfamily members\u2019 genes that he go out as a staunch, reliable\ndefender of his community\u2019s values than as apathetic or as\na social dissident.\nR3. Propositional beliefs about the supernatural\ndo not always cause behaviour (and sometimes\nthey are in opposition to behaviour)\nIt is important to understand that the three existential illu-\nsions identified in the target article (immortality, teleologi-\ncal authorship of the soul, and symbolic natural events)\nmay not be as salient in industrialized societies today as\nthey were in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness,\nwhere they were unlikely to be punctured by scientific\nknowledge or discouraged through cultural secularization.\nEven in modern scientific nations, however, among well-\neducated and scientifically literate people, the biases\nidentified in the target article are not recognized as illu-\nsions and continue to have deep emotional resonance.\nSandelands, for example, concludes his theologically\ninspired commentary by stating that, \u201ca full and true\nstudy of man must begin in God.\u201d (In some sense this is\ntrue: Our species like any other must be understood\nwithin the parameters of the modern synthesis and God\nis just another slave to human genes.) And, moreover,\nResponse\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 489\neven in recognizing them as illusions we fail to sever their\nemotional underlay, which may still pump-prime beha-\nviour \u2013 the level at which natural selection operates. I\ndo not believe in the afterlife, but as a potential home-\nowner I certainly would feel uncomfortable living in a\nhouse where a stranger has recently died. In this case, it\nis my eerie feelings and not my belief or disbelief in the\nafterlife that would be a better predictor of whether I\nmake an offer on the house. This is not to say that prop-\nositional beliefs about religion and the supernatural are\nfrequently epiphenomenal, but rather they are more prop-\nerly viewed as rough indices of unconscious reasoning\n(and perhaps phenomenal states) than as accurate predic-\ntors of behaviour.\nR3.1. Global secularization cannot extirpate a true\npsychological adaptation\nBeit-Hallahmi writes that, \u201cThe global secularization\nprocess means that we no longer interpret misfortune\nas caused by supernatural agents.\u201d But this \u201cgod-of-the-\ngaps\u201d hypothesis has now been disconfirmed in social\npsychology experiments (see Weeks & Lupfer [2000]\nfor an account of distal-proximal attributions to God).\nMoreover, the argument that scientific or secular expla-\nnations \u201creplace\u201d more na\u0131\u00a8ve or irrational supernatural\nexplanations is intuitively unpersuasive; obviously they\ncan occur alongside one another (e.g., Subbotsky\n2001). Theologians who saw the recent tsunamis of\nEast Asia as an angry, moralistic message from God\nwere probably not na\u0131\u00a8ve to the fact that they were\ncaused by earthquakes on the Indian Ocean floor. No\nmatter how culturally secularized we become, God\npokes through, whispering in the most godless of scien-\ntists\u2019 ears. At the end of their commentary, Gjersoe &\nHood correctly point out that in order to understand\nsupernatural beliefs from a scientific perspective we\nmust first acknowledge and recognize our own superna-\ntural dispositions.\nThe best research designs in the cognitive science of\nreligion are those that are able to pry apart unconscious\nreasoning from explicit or \u201ctheologically correct\u201d reli-\ngious beliefs (see Barrett 2000). Socrates\u2019 \u201cidea of\nimmortality\u201d as described by Ferrari is therefore of\nquestionable countenance, since this \u201creasoned con-\nclusion\u201d would be heavily influenced by the same under-\nlying cognitive constraints that motivate others to think\nin this fashion. Innate psychological biases with regard\nto the supernatural (and the behaviours they generate)\nreveal themselves most clearly when they directly con-\ntradict stated beliefs. For example, those who believe\nGod can do everything at once actually reason as if\nGod were constrained by a human attention span\n(Barrett & Keil 1996); some people who believe that\nthe mind stops at death nevertheless reason about a\ndead person as if he still has thoughts (Bering 2002a);\nscientific theorizers are wary of magical incantations\n(Subbotsky 2001); others who consider themselves to\nbe materialists refuse to sign a contract relinquishing\ntheir souls at death to an experimenter (Haidt et al.\n2004); and children who say they don\u2019t believe in mon-\nsters shy away from a box they are told contains a\nmonster (Harris et al. 1991).\nSimilarly, if the folk psychology of souls is a true\npsychological adaptation, then it should be empirically\ndetectable, even in atheists. For example, McAdam\u2019s\n(2001) findings from narrative psychology suggest that\npeople tend to fall into one of two categories: those\nwho view personal misfortunes as contaminative epi-\nsodes in their life stories (where the event permanently\ndisrupted an otherwise positive life course and cast a\ndark shadow over their biographies), and those who\nview such events as redemptive episodes (where the\nevent, although difficult at the time, was responsible\nfor a positive redirection of their life course). It may\nbe possible to detect intentionality themes in atheists\u2019\nself-narratives through the use of such paradigms\n(e.g., \u201cit was a \u2018life lesson,\u2019 \u201d \u201cit wasn\u2019t supposed to\nhappen,\u201d and so on).\nR4. Developmental considerations\nEvans & Wellman argue that, \u201cif Bering\u2019s selectionist\nexplanation was on target then one might predict a\nunique and relatively robust developmental trajectory,\nregardless of input.\u201d This is certainly true, and I believe\nthat this trajectory will be borne out. To test Evans &\nWellman\u2019s prediction, we need, first, to have an accurate\ndevelopmental model that delineates the ages at which\nthe three existential illusions (immortality, teleological\nauthorship of the soul, and symbolic natural events)\nappear in childhood. We do not yet have enough data to\nconstruct such a model and therefore developmental\nresearch in this area is urgently needed. Although\nFerrari and Estes are right to point out that cognitive\ndevelopmentalists have for decades been exploring\nrelated questions about children\u2019s distinction between\nthe mind and body, particularly in the area of theory of\nmind, this \u201cabundant research\u201d (Estes) hardly constitutes\na targeted attempt at systematically revealing the social\ncognitive factors that lend themselves so seamlessly to\nthe existential illusions highlighted in the article. On the\ncontrary, such a targeted research programme is strikingly\nabsent, not only in developmental psychology, but in all\nthe subdisciplines of experimental psychology.\nR4.1. Contradictory findings on the development\nof children\u2019s afterlife beliefs\nIt appears that the little we do know about the develop-\nment of a folk psychology of souls is contradictory, as\ndiscussed in the commentaries by Evans & Wellman\nand Harris & Astuti. These commentators tell us that\nrecent findings on children\u2019s afterlife beliefs have failed\nto replicate the pattern reported by Bering and Bjorklund\n(2004; also Bering et al. 2005a.) For example, Harris and\nGimenez\u2019s (2005) findings suggest that afterlife beliefs\nincrease with age rather than decrease and are moderated\nby the religious context of the experimenters\u2019 questions\n(with children being more likely to endorse psychological\nfunctioning after death when information about the dead\ncharacter includes words like \u201cpriest\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d). There-\nfore, Harris & Astuti question whether belief in the\nafterlife is in fact a default cognitive stance.\nResponse\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n490 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nR4.2. Some \u201ccontradictory\u201d findings may\nnot be contradictory\nThis conflicting pattern of developmental findings,\nhowever, is difficult to interpret at present. To begin\nwith, the central research questions motivating these\nother studies on children\u2019s concepts of death are very\ndifferent from my own (as well as from each other) and\nthe methodologies vary accordingly. Evans & Wellman\ncite work by Barrett and Behne (2005) as evidence that,\nin contrast to my findings, four- and five-year-olds in this\nstudy did not attribute psychological states to dead\nagents. Barrett and Behne\u2019s study, however, did not inves-\ntigate children\u2019s afterlife beliefs, but instead concerned\nchildren\u2019s ability to differentiate between dead and sleep-\ning animals in the physical environment. The investigators\nreasoned that this is an adaptive function in that it prevents\nunnecessary vigilance toward the bodies of dead animals\nthrough the cue-driven activation of an innate \u201cliving\/\ndead remapping mechanism.\u201d\nIn the study by Barrett and Behne (2005), children were\nasked five questions about the dead versus sleeping\nanimal: Can it move? Know you were there? Move if\ntouched? Can it be afraid? Can it hurt you? The fact\nthat the youngest children answered \u201cno\u201d in reference to\nthe dead animal, but \u201cyes\u201d in reference to the sleeping\nanimal, is hardly prima facie evidence against my argu-\nment that belief in the afterlife is a cognitive default. In\nfact, if belief in the afterlife is a cognitive default, then\nwe would actually predict the pattern of findings reported\nby Barrett and Behne (2005). That is, preschoolers is\nshould answer \u201cno\u201d to questions about the bodies of\ndead animals (notice the key word \u201cit\u201d in the questions\nposed to children) if indeed they view the mind as being\nliberated from the body at death.\nR4.3. Methodological concerns presently limit\ntheoretical inferences\nLike Evans & Wellman, Harris & Astuti state that their\nown research programme on the development of afterlife\nbeliefs reveals a set of findings that in many ways contra-\ndicts the developmental trajectory reported by Bering\nand Bjorklund (2004), or at least tells a more complicated\nstory, with religious testimony and cultural exposure\nencouraging such beliefs. Again, however, it is difficult to\ncompare findings across these studies. We deliberately\navoided eschatological language in our research design\nbecause we were wary of biasing children\u2019s answers\nthrough the experimenters\u2019 language and behaviours,\nand in fact our empirical reports list many of the safe-\nguards we used to protect against such biases (Hughes).\nIn contrast, such language was an important manipulated\nvariable for both Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005) and Astuti\nand Harris (submitted).\nFurthermore, the coding procedures used to determine\nwhether children attributed continued psychological func-\ntioning to a dead agent meaningfully differed between our\nstudies and those described by Harris & Astuti. Our data\nwere coded on the basis of children\u2019s follow-up answers to\nthe questions rather than their initial yes or no response.\nWe reasoned that a \u201cno\u201d response is inherently ambiguous\nand should not be seen as clear evidence for non-continuity\njudgements after death. Young children in our study often\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the initial questions about the dead\nagent\u2019s continued capacities (\u201cCan Brown Mouse still\nsee?\u201d), but upon further questioning it became clear that\nthey were nevertheless reasoning in terms of an afterlife\n(e.g., \u201cbecause it\u2019s too dark in the alligator\u2019s belly\u201d).\nHarris and Gime\u00b4nez (as well as Astuti & Harris [submitted]\nand Barrett & Behne [2005]) failed to operationalize\nchildren\u2019s \u201cno\u201d answers in this way; instead they took\nthem at face value as evidence of an understanding of the\nnon-functionality of the capacity in question. It is therefore\nimpossible to know whether the findings these authors\nreport is a product of the religious context of the story, as\nthey argue, or is in fact an artefact of their coding pro-\ncedure. Finally, the youngest children in the Harris and\nGime\u00b4nez study were seven-year-olds, whereas our most\nrobust findings for afterlife beliefs came from the three-\nand four-year-olds we tested, providing the basis of our\nnativist claims.\nR5. Cognitive processes underlying the folk\npsychology of souls\nSeveral of the commentaries focused on the precise mech-\nanisms by which existential illusions are generated. Bullot,\nfor example, provides a distinction between two types\nof agent-tracking mechanisms that he believes weighs\nheavily on the theoretical integrity of an evolved folk psy-\nchology of souls. In perceptual tracking, Bullot reasons, \u201ca\ntarget individual is directly tracked by a sensory-motor\nsystem.\u201d In contrast, epistemic tracking occurs when an\nagent \u201cis spatio-temporally pursued by indirect epistemic\nmeans such as communication and reasoning.\u201d\nAccording to Bullot, because both types of tracking\nrequire empirical or material traces of the agents\u2019 ontologi-\ncal existence, such as behavioural residue (e.g., finger-\nprints), the present case of souls, gods, and ghosts poses\nan important problem for the evolutionary model. Bullot\nreasons that ghosts and gods should therefore be charac-\nterized as fictionally grounded referents, \u201cwhich rest on\ndescriptive resources and individual\/collective imagin-\nation,\u201d rather than empirically grounded referents. Pre-\nsumably this would be evidence of the cultural origins of\nsupernatural agents. I have argued, however, that our\nspecies has an innate predisposition to see natural events\nas actual empirical traces of real supernatural agents. It\nfollows from this that natural events serve the same func-\ntion as tractable social behaviours, activating similar epis-\ntemic tracking mechanisms. An infinite array of life\u2019s\nvicissitudes strewn throughout personal biographies is\nrepresented as God\u2019s \u201cbehaviours.\u201d It is unclear to me\nhow Sherlock Holmes, a fictional character that Bullot\ncompares to gods and ghosts, could leave similar empirical\nand perceptible traces that are capable of confirming\npeoples\u2019 intuitive hypotheses of his ontological existence.\nR5.1. Individuation equals ensoulment\nIn a related commentary, Newman, Blok, & Rips\n[Newman et al.] describe their fascinating research pro-\ngramme on identity tracking, concluding that my argu-\nment for a specialized cognitive system dedicated to\nreasoning about souls lacks parsimony. This conclusion\nhinges on a series of studies revealing that participants\nResponse\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5 491\nbelieve in the continued psychological existence of not\nonly individual people after dramatic transformations\n(such as someone who has died or whose memories are\nplaced in a robotic body), but also the continued identity\nof individual objects that have undergone similarly dra-\nmatic transformations (e.g., a specific car, \u201cRustbucket\u201d\nis still identified as \u201cRustbucket\u201d after going through a\n\u201cparticle pipeline\u201d and reconfigured into a boat). \u201cThus,\u201d\nargue Newman et al., \u201cbelief in the persistence of individ-\nuals through radical changes in kind is not restricted\nto persons and need not include the notion of a soul\u201d\n(para 8).\nI interpret these findings very differently from these\ncommentators, however, and see them as generally sup-\nportive of my evolutionary model rather than as falsify-\ning my hypotheses about the folk psychology of souls\n(see also Nichols). Newman et al. miss the critical\nfact that by individuating the target objects in this\nmanner (e.g., through proper naming) they may be\ndoing something akin to ensouling inanimate objects.\nThrough the experimental individuation of objects, par-\nticipants may be reasoning about such objects through\nan animistic lens. As a consequence of this, they are\nlikely to tacitly endow these objects with psychological\nstates, in effect viewing them as possessing souls.\nBloch\u2019s sardonic comments about the ecological validity\nof the mouse puppet show paradigm (i.e., Bering &\nBjorklund 2004; Bering et al. 2005a) similarly dismisses\nthe animating effects of individuating target \u201ccharacters\u201d\nin an experimental context.\nR5.2. The simulation constraint hypothesis\nSeveral commentaries focused on the simulation con-\nstraint hypothesis (Antony; Cohen & Consoli; Robbins\n& Jack; Kemmerer & Gupta; Preston, Gray, &\nWegner [Preston et al.]). To revisit the central thesis\nof this hypothesis, I claimed that a delimiting phenomen-\nological boundary prevents people from experiencing the\nabsence of certain categories of mental states, such as\nemotions, desires, and various episteme (the most\n\u201cethereal\u201d qualia). Because we can never know what it\nfeels like to be without such states, these natural represen-\ntational borders encourage afterlife beliefs. When we\nattempt to reason about what it will be \u201clike\u201d after death \u2013\nand what it is \u201clike\u201d for those who have already died \u2013 we\ninevitably get ensnared by simulation constraints and\nreason in terms of a continued consciousness.\nPreston et al. reason that belief in the soul stems in\nlarge part from the illusion of conscious will, the feeling\nthat the self is a sort of abstract homunculus that con-\nsciously wills the body to act (when in fact this feeling of\nauthorship of our own actions is epiphenomenal). I\nagree that this is an important component of the folk psy-\nchology of souls, but I see it as a refinement to the present\nmodel, rather than an alternative account. Cohen &\nConsoli\u2019s description of Cotard\u2019s syndrome as being\ncharacterized by the delusion that one is already dead,\nas well as Kemmerer & Gupta\u2019s discussion of the\nneurobiological basis of out-of-body-experiences, do\nseem to provide at least indirect support for the simulation\nconstraint hypothesis.\nIn his thoughtful commentary, Antony reasons that in\norder to \u201crun a simulation\u201d of a dead person\u2019s mind, one\nmust already have a belief in the afterlife, which runs con-\ntrary to this nativist position on the illusion of immortality.\n\u201cPrior to simulating a dead agent\u2019s mind,\u201d he argues, \u201cit\nmust be assumed there is a mind to simulate. But that\nalready is to assume an afterlife.\u201d He then writes, \u201cIt\nfollows that nothing about a simulation itself can explain\nour belief in an afterlife, since some such belief or assump-\ntion is a precondition for the planning and running of any\nsuch simulation.\u201d There is probably some truth to Antony\u2019s\nchicken-and-egg reasoning, but it is unclear to me why he\nsees this as a problem for my nativist arguments concern-\ning the origins of afterlife beliefs. If children are con-\nfronted with someone who has died, they need not\n\u201cassume an afterlife\u201d \u2013 at least in any meaningful concep-\ntual sense, and certainly not in terms of a propositional\nbelief about an afterlife \u2013 to attempt to reason about the\ndead person\u2019s current state of mind through appeal to\ntheir own mental states.\nR6. Concluding remarks\nThe commentaries in response to the target article are all\nthat a Behavioral and Brain Sciences author could wish\nfor. They are filled with incisive criticisms, counterargu-\nments, and references to important work of which I was\nunaware. All of these undoubtedly will add to a more\ninformed cognitive analysis of the subtle strands that\nbind together morality, souls, and meaning.\nNOTES\n1. This is the literary device behind Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s\nThe Scarlet Letter. Hester Prynne, an otherwise virtuous\nwoman, is publicly labelled an \u201cadulteress\u201d (literally, with a\ncapital \u201cA\u201d) and shunned by her small Puritan community.\n2. In Sartre\u2019s famous play \u201cNo Exit\u201d (1946\/1989), in which\nthree strangers find themselves uncomfortably together in a\ndrawing-room of Hell, there are no mirrors or windows in the\nroom, sleep is not permitted, and the light is always on. The char-\nacters\u2019 eyelids are paralyzed, disallowing them even the luxury of\nblinking. One of the characters, Garcin, reacts with muted horror\nto the prospect of being constantly observed by the others for all\neternity. He is also convinced that he is under surveillance by\ndemons, \u201call those eyes intent on me. Devouring me.\u201d It is not\nhard to see why this would be such an exquisite torture.\n3. Interestingly, after a long historical period when people\nmay have been able to emigrate to new social groups and to\n\u201cstart over\u201d if they spoilt their reputation, the present media\nage, in some ways, more accurately reflects the conditions\nfaced by our ancestors. With newspapers, telephones, cameras,\ntelevision, and the Internet at our disposal, personal details\nabout medical problems, spending activities, criminal and finan-\ncial history, and divorce records (to name just a few potentially\nsundry tidbits), are not only permanently archived, but can be\ndistributed in microseconds to, literally, billions of other\npeople. The old adage \u201cWherever you go, there you are\u201d takes\non new meaning in light of the evolution of information technol-\nogy. The Internet, in particular, is an active microcosm of human\nsociality that has not yet been properly analyzed in Darwinian\nterms. From background checks to match making services,\nfrom anonymous web site browsing to piracy and identity theft,\nfrom \u201cGoogling\u201d ourselves and peers to flaming bad professors\n(e.g., www.ratemyprofessor.com) and stingy customers (e.g.,\nwww.bitterwaitress.com), the Internet is ancient social psychol-\nogy meeting new information technology.\nResponse\/Bering: The folk psychology of souls\n492 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2006) 29:5\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI am grateful to Harvey Whitehouse and Paulo Sousa for helpful\ncomments on an earlier version of this response.\nReferences\nLetters \u201ca\u201d and \u201cr\u201d appearing before authors\u2019 initials refer to target article\nand response, respectively.\nAarts, H., Custers, R. & Wegner, D.
