When attention is turned to what effect they have on policy it is \noften difficult to discern any link between their use and policy change.    This paper \nseeks to address this problem by consolidating current thinking on indicators and asking \nthe question \u2013 How far have notions of governance been incorporated into current \nresearch into indicators?  The answer to this question has implications for the \ncontinuing utility of indicators as policy tools, not only in so far as they are able to aide \nthe evaluation of policy, but also, and arguably more importantly, in how they are able \nto facilitate relationships between actors and act a catalyst around which various \ncontested meanings of sustainability can be evaluated. \nKeywords: Sustainability indicators, governance, sustainable development\nArticle Word Count = 5323\nTitle:\t\n\r  Incorporating Local Sustainability Indicators into Structures of Local Governance: \nA Review of the Literature\nINTRODUCTION\n\t\n\r Sustainability indicators have now been with us almost 20 years, from the \npublication of In Search of Indicators of Sustainable Development (1991), to the launch \nof Local Agenda 21 (1992) the proliferation of research into the measurement and \nmonitoring of sustainable development has grown exponentially. This growth in \ninformation regarding sustainable development indicators (SIs) has led some to describe \ntheir popularity as \u2018inescapable\u2019 (McAlpine & Birnie 2005) whilst others talk of an an \n\u201cindicator industry\u201d (King et al 2000).  Indeed this journal has played a pivotal role in \nthe discourse surrounding SIs by providing an arena for debates and research to be \npublished and co-ordinated.  From the classical exchange between Brugman and \nPinfield in 1997, which opened up the dialogue on scientific relevance versus local \nresonance, to two special issues on local sustainability indicators in 1999 and 2003, \nLocal Environment has been at the forefront of indicator research.  This article seeks to \nconsolidate current thinking on indicators and ask the question \u2013 How far have notions \nof governance been incorporated into current research into indicators?  The answer to \nthis question has implications for the continuing utility of indicators for policy tools not \nonly in so far as they are able to aide the evaluation of policy but also, and arguably \nmore importantly, in how they are able to facilitate relationships between actors and act \na catalyst around which various contested meanings of sustainability can be evaluated.  \nThe paper will do this through a review of the literature published between 2005-2008 \nexamining specifically studies on the use and effectiveness of SIs.  In doing so, it is \nhoped that trends in the research can be identified, offering new insights into SI \neffectiveness.   \n\t\n\r Before beginning it is important to note that this paper is not an exhaustive \nliterature review explicitly covering every article written on SIs in the above mentioned \nperiod, which itself is brief reflecting a desire to present emerging trends within this \nfield of research.  Rather, the paper seeks to be selective and schematic in its approach, \nthereby offering the reader a framework with which to evaluate emerging thinking on \nSIs.  The works summarised here are broken into three broad typologies, which this \nauthor believes are unfolding as the dominant discourses within the literature.  Each \narticle used represents an excellent illustrative example of the points raised within the \nthese three camps, presenting readers with field-posts and way-markings for further \ninvestigation.  Whilst there were many other papers that could have been added as \nexamples to each grouping it was felt, that to avoid repetition and to keep to recently \npublished research, it was best to work with a selected set of articles.   Where papers \npublished before 2005 are referenced this is done only to establish the lineal roots of \neach typology.\n\t\n\r The primary literature covering SIs written and published between 2005 to 2008 \ncan be broken into three roughly constituted camps. The first of these is dedicated to the \ndiscourse of \u2018sound science\u2019 and the building of better indicator systems and indicators \nthrough technical advancement. On the whole, work within this genre does not link \nindicators to specific policy change; rather it discusses decision-making in aspirational \ntones and pushes for indicator systems that better take into account the nuances and \ncomplexities of eco-systems.  The second category again harkens back to an older \nparadigm of examining the softer qualitative impacts of indicator programmes and \nfocuses more at the community level.  Here work often acknowledges the lack of \nprogress indicators have made in respect of specific policy actions and extols the \nbenefits of the softer impacts of capacity building, the production of social capital, and \ncommunication that can be gained through indicator programmes.  They take this work \nfurther by proposing various frameworks that help capture and more predictably create \nthese soft impacts thus bettering local policy making overall. The final strand of the \nliterature moves into newer territory by actually considering the impacts indicators have \non decision making and postulating what this tells us about forms of governance.  In \ndoing this, these studies offer us something unique through the explicit and tangible \nlinks they make between the discourses of sustainability bound up in the creation of \nindicator systems and the dynamics of governance bound up their use. \nType 1: Building a Better Mousetrap\n\t\n\r Much of the early literature on indicator development was typically distilled into \nrather formulaic notions of good indictor design, which combined a number of factors \nin order to produce the \u2018ideal\u2019 indicator.  So for example, if one were to add together the \nintended purpose of an indicator with consideration of its desired audience ensuring \nrelevant consultation\/participation and an appropriate design, \u2018good\u2019 indicator \ndevelopment could be achieved (see Levett 1998, Holland 1997, Jesinghaus 1999, and \nPastille, 2002:11).  This technical discourse on indicators was embedded into notions of \n\u2018sound science\u2019 and technocratic policy making, where the policy process was viewed \nas linear and indicators were seen as simply an input into that process.  Within this \nparadigm, checklists regarding the measurability, validity, and transparency of \nindicators were developed to ensure rational and statistically appropriate tools. \n\t\n\r Current literature within this frame also embeds itself into a scientific or \necological discourse with prominent themes relating to the measurement of \nsustainability via statistical innovation (Tasser et al 2008), barriers to indicator success \n(Hickey & Innes 2008; Mayer 2008) and an improved understanding of indicator \nframeworks (Wilson et al 2007; Niemeijer & de Groot 2008a; 2008b; Pulselli et al \n2008).  Two themes stand out as significant within this discourse and are handled either \nexplicitly or implicitly within the papers summarised here. The first theme is that of \ncomplexity the second is the rather \u2018aspirational\u2019 role indicators should play in relation \nto decision making.  \n\t\n\r Complexity is a theme which runs throughout these articles and typically relates \neither to the complexity of indicator systems and ways in which technicians can \nsimplify measurements to present to policy makers or the potentially more interesting \nargument regarding the complexity of ecosystems and indicator systems themselves. A \ncase in point of measurement simplification is presented by Tasser et al\u2019s (2008) study \nof biodiversity indicators used in the South Tyrol region of northern Italy.  Here they \nfound, through using factor analysis, that three dimensions within the indicator sets \n(naturalness, landscape structure, and species diversity) accounted for more that 76% of \nthe overall variance, leading them to propose that factor analysis could be used to \nsimplify indicator systems \u201cwithout loosing too much information\u201d (p204). Certainly, \nby reducing seven indicators to three and displaying them graphically as maps using \nGIS software the authors do make steps forward in terms of presentation of complex \ninformation to a lay audience, although this is clearly a method not without risk.  \nHowever, whilst the article does discuss the social construction of sustainability (p210) \nto some extent, its main thrust is improving technical aspects of measurement systems \ntherefore firmly wedding itself to the older paradigm of \u2018sound science\u2019.\n\t\n\r A more nuanced reading of the complexity thesis belongs to those authors who \npropose that attention should be focused on the dynamic and intricate nature of \necosystems when investigating and developing indicator systems. Within this frame \necosystems should be seen as \u201c\u2026a set of elements, both natural and anthropic [that] \ninteract, constituting a complex network of relations that cannot be investigated through \nthe elements of the system\u2026being isolated from each other.\u201d (Tiezzi and Bastianoni, \n2008:329).  What is notable within this description is the acknowledgement of inter-\nrelationships and networks of factors that work together to form the eco-system and the \nneed for a system of measurement that acknowledges these interdependencies.  Most of \nthe authors within this frame discuss the importance of using multiple frameworks of \nevaluation so that issues of scale and network interaction can be explicitly addressed \n(see here Pulselli et al 2008; Bagliani et al 2008; and Mayer 2008).  The authors who \npresent this position most forcefully are Niemeijer and de Groot (2008a; 2008b) in their \nwork looking at moving from the examination of causal chains to the use of causal \nnetworks in indicator reporting.\n\t\n\r Niemeijer and de Groot (2008a) acknowledge the contributions that have been \nmade in the development of assessment frameworks like Pressure-State-Response, \nDriving force-State-Response, and Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response in \ntheir engagement with notions of causality, however they criticise these for being uni-\ndirectional and therefore lacking in a full understanding of complexity (p1).   Causal \nchain frameworks typically work by placing one or more indicators at the beginning of \na chain and one or more at the end to illustrate a relationship in a single field of \nsustainable development.  However, in so doing the inter-relationship between both the \nfields (e.g deseritifcation or acidification) and indicators is lost (op cited: 2).  The \nauthors comment that these frameworks \u201c\u2026deal poorly with the complexities of the real \nworld (i.e. simplify cause and effect relationships too much) and provide little analytical \nguidance in the selection of indicators and in the establishment of \u201ccontrol points\u201d for \nmonitoring and management of sustainability.\u201d (op cited: 17).  Their proposal is a turn \naway from systems that place emphasis on indicators singly towards one that \u201c...places \nthe indicator set at the heart of the selection process\u201d (Niemeijer and de Groot 2008b: \n14).  They seek to accomplish this through boundary specification, a clear \nunderstanding and definition of the domain to be examined, and crucially an interactive \nmapping of the indicators used within a directional graph (Op cited: 20).  This final \nstage actually builds a picture of the causal network and allows for better informed \ndecisions to be made regarding the complexities of indicator selection thorough the \nunderstanding of interaction amongst the indicators within the network.\n\t\n\r The second theme within this section of the literature deals with the aspirational \nrole indicators are to play in the policy making process, with some articles going so far \nas to use an almost medicalised language in their treatment of indicators discussing \n\u201csustainability therapy\u201d,  \u201csustainability diagnosis\u201d and \u201cdiagnostic instruments\u201d (Teizzi \nand Bastianoni, 2008: p329).  Many of the articles here hold fast to the ideal of \nindicators as pure technocratic information that will naturally facilitate and feed into \npolicy making.  Authors speak of indicators as providing an \u201c\u2026exhaustive and \nquantitative picture of the complex relationships between society and the environment\u201d \nthat will provide administrators and decision-makers the information they need to direct \npolicy (Bagliani et al, 2008: p364).   Additionally, they discuss the challenges to the \ncreation of a \u201c\u2026scientifically sound, useful, and effective indicator framework that will \ndemonstrate progress\u201d towards sustainability (Hickey and Innes, 2008: p131).  The \nover-riding conceptualisation of indicators within this section of the literature is perhaps \nbest summed up by Moldan and Dahl (2007: p1) when they assert that \u201c\u2026we need \ninformation tools that condense and digest information for rapid assimilation while \nmaking it possible to explore issues further as needed.  This is the goal of indicators\u201d.  \nHere faith is expressed in the scientific nature of indicators and even when this is \ncoupled with participatory approaches (e.g. Hickey and Innes, 2008; H\u00e0k et al 2007) or \nthe acknowledgement that due to their complexity many different measurement tools \nmay be needed in order to help decision makers to \u201c\u2026make the \u2018best\u2019 decisions and \ndesign the \u2018best\u2019 policies\u201d (Wilson et al, 2007:p312) the overall message is that \nindicators themselves are, by virtue of their scientific validity, appropriate tools for \nfeeding information into the policy process. \n\t\n\r In order to better understand the aspirational spin put on indicators within this \nframe it is important to clarify the conceptualisation of the policy process these authors \nhave.  Looking again at the work of Moldan and Dahl, who do attempt to cover \nconcepts of governance in their work, we see policy spoken of as a \u201clife-cycle\u201d that runs \nfrom the acknowledgement of the problem, \u201cto the design of the policy and its \nimplementation, evaluation, and adaptation, and finally to its phasing out or integration \ninto another policy instrument\u201d (2007:p4).  Within this policy cycle, they see indicators \nperforming a number of roles feeding information back into the policy life cycle.  As \nstated earlier, the primary problem with this notion of indicators is that it assumes a \nlinear input driven policy process that cannot explain the inherent complexities of \nmodern governing frameworks, which are not based so much on traditional hierarchy \nbut are formed out of broader networks of actors from both inside and outside \ngovernment. \nType 2: Its not so much the winning its about taking part\n\t\n\r Much of the early work on indicators was firmly grounded in looking at \nimproving them as tools so questions of measurement and clarity were paramount.  \nWhen the research focus began to shift into the actual measurable effect indicators were \nhaving on policy a new wrinkle developed in the debate.  This was that it was difficult \nto make any real linkages between indicator use and policy change (Innes and Booher, \n2000).  Here the arguments shifted from the effects that indicators had as decision \nmaking tools to their benefits on more developmental goals like capacity building, \nparticipation, and engagement (Sommer, 2000; Gahin et al, 2003).  Writing in 2003, \nGahin et al examined five community indicator programmes in the United States and \ncategorised their outcomes into: \n\u2022 Intangible Benefits \u2013 (e.g. forums for discussion, relationship building; \nincreased awareness; shifts in values)\n\u2022 Concrete Benefits \u2013 (e.g. new agendas or programmes; influence on decisions; \nchanged individual behaviour; resource allocation)\n\u2022 Measurable Benefits \u2013 (e.g. \u201cCHANGE! Progress toward sustainability\u2026as \nmeasured by the indicators\u201d)\nPerhaps not surprisingly they found that the majority of the benefits identified as \ncoming as a results of sustainability indicator programmes fell into the \u2018intangible\u2019 \ncategory with a few \u2018concrete\u2019 benefits shown and no \u2018measurable\u2019 benefits whatsoever.  \nWhilst this may paint a rather bleak picture of the effectiveness of indicators, they \nstressed that the \u2018foundation building\u2019 aspects of the intangible effects of indicator \nprogrammes in creating social knowledge, catalysing communities, and opening \ndialogue should not be ignored simply because these qualities are hard to measure.  \nCurrent literature within this frame either implicitly or explicitly seeks to build on these \n\u2018intangible\u2019 benefits through the creation of more effective indicators, all the while \nacknowledging that social impacts of indicator programmes should be captured and \nbuilt upon to better the policy process.\n\t\n\r A series of articles by Reed et al are an excellent case in point, here they explore \nthe convergence between what they term as a \u2018reductionist\u2019 approach to indicator \ndevelopment based on expert driven technocratic policy and the softer more community \nbased \u2018participatory\u2019 approach (Reed et al 2005, Fraser et al 2006, Reed et al 2006).  \nThrough a literature review of a number of indicator programmes ranging from \ngrassland management in the Kalahari to forestry management in Western Canada, they \nacknowledge that a level of integration between \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019 approaches to indicator \ndevelopment brings about the best hope for measuring progress toward sustainable \ndevelopment (IBID).  Whilst they note key technical issues in indicator creation and \nuse, like boundary specification and policy relevance, they also detail how an \nintegrationist approach might be better able to facilitate community action and learning \n(Reed et al, 2005), which they classify as perhaps the most significant benefit of \nindicator programmes (Fraser et al, 2006: p123).  In order to illustrate the importance of \nconvergence Reed et al (2005) revisit Bossel\u2019s (2001) system-based approach and show \nhow this framework for indicator development can be combined with notions of \nparticipation so that community visions  and goals may be linked to measurable rational \nindicators thereby offering a productive way forward for indicator development and \ncommunity empowerment (Reed et al, 2005).\n\t\n\r Joanna Becker, writing in Local Environment, presents another framework for \nindicator development this time loosely based on Capra\u2019s \u2018web of life theory\u2019 to define \naspects of sustainable development in order that a discussion about indicators can be \nbetter framed (2005).  In this article, she acknowledges Bell and Morse\u2019s (2003) point \nthat whilst the utility of indictors in terms of policy effect may be open to question, they \ndo serve as an excellent learning opportunity for stakeholders (Becker, 2005: 88).   Here \nshe goes some way in progressing the thinking on \u2018soft\u2019 or \u2018intangible\u2019 impacts brought \nabout through the educative value and participatory processes of indicator selection.  \nWhat is important about Becker\u2019s work is that she does not simply stop at noting the \n\u2018social good\u2019 brought about through a better educated and informed citizenry; she \nactually tries to capitalise on this effect.  Becker does this by proposing a framework for \nindicator development based on ecological terminology to help describe various \nelements involved in sustainable development thereby providing a structure to guide \nand progress stakeholder discussions on indicator selection.  By doing this, she seeks to \nfirm up the sometimes unfocused discursive processes that go into indicator \ndevelopment, by utilising terminology and principles taken from ecology.  By framing \ndiscussions around collaboration, auto-sufficiency, and resilience, she believes that the \neducative value of indicator selection can aid in stakeholder\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of how to \nachieve sustainable development, which is the first step in making progress towards \nit.\u201d (Becker, 2005: p98-99 my emphasis).  \n\t\n\r Bell and Morse (2005) also propose a framework to capture the learning benefits \nof Sustainability Indicators.  In their study of the Blue Plan in Malta they use the Kolb \nLearning Cycle to explore indictor development, and note the beneficial \u2018Sustainability \nTherapy\u2019 an approach like this can have on those who feel \u201ctrapped in processes they \nfind orthogonal to their own perceptions\u201d (Bell & Morse 2005: p 50).   Here the authors \noutline the linear nature of sustainability projects and juxtapose this with the circularity \nof the concept itself.  By applying a framework like Kolb\u2019s learning cycle, they \nillustrate how sustainable development projects can be made more \u2018circular\u2019 thus \nfighting the linearity of these approaches.  For example, they comment that one notable \noutcome of the Blue Plan in Malta \u201cwas the joy that the participants showed in learning \nabout sustainable development through SIs\u201d (Bell & Morse, 2005: p. 49).  Whilst they \nacknowledge that learning may not be a key aim of the project donors, they also \nhighlight how SIs and the learning processes that emanate from them can be used to \nshed light on unequal power relationships and areas of conflict.   Further, they assert \nthat through the use of a \u201clearning framework\u201d it is easier to \u201ckeep contesting actors \ntogether\u201d by providing \u201cthem with a platform for fruitful debate (Kasemir et al, 1999 \ncited in Bell & Morse, 2005: p50).  For Bell and Morse, \u201cthe learning is the doing\u201d and \nthe framework provides the mechanism by which the linearity of sustainable \ndevelopment projects can be married to the circularity of sustainability as a theory.\n\t\n\r While these articles have certainly moved the debate forward in terms of the \nconceptualisation and capture of \u2018soft\u2019 indicator impacts like community empowerment, \ncapacity building, and the educative value of indicators, what they lack is a real \nengagement with notions of governance and the policy process.  Here the research \nmisses out by not explicitly discussing the role that indicators can play in network \nintegration between policy makers, departments and stakeholders both across spatial \nscales and policy sectors.  The next typology deals with these issues in a far more \ncomprehensive way helping to fill what Hezri and Dovers refer to as a \u2018lacuna\u2019 in \ncurrent indicator research (2006: p.85).\nType 3: Connecting the dots\n\t\n\r Part of the problem we have seen so far with the articles summarised here on \nindicators is that that they either engage with a technocratic discourse on indicator \ndevelopment and therefore provide a rather formulaic \u2018recipe-book\u2019 of how to \u2018do\u2019 \nsustainable development or they emphasise the \u2018soft\u2019, intangible outcomes of indicator \nprogrammes without ever coming to terms with how SIs affect policy or alter \ngovernance.  In reality, there is a third way in which these programmes can be analysed \nthat could prove far more fruitful in telling us about local governing arrangements and \nthe social construction of sustainability.  Shedding light on these issues could, in the \nlong term, help planners and communities better embed sustainability into the policy \nprocess.  This alternative approach is to take a serious and measured look at how \ngovernance is articulated through indicator programmes including issues like the \nrelationships developed through interactions between central and local policy actors and \nthe manner in which the dialogue over the contested nature of sustainable development \nis produced and reproduced in policy networks.  As O\u2019Riordan (2004) comments, both \nsustainability and governance are fluid and slippery ideas, but as Jordon (2008) rightly \nnotes, it is impossible to avoid this partnership of terms if we are to seek a better \nunderstanding of how sustainable development is being operationalised.  The next series \nof articles offer insights into these issues, engaging seriously with notions of \ngovernance and the contested nature of sustainability itself. \n\t\n\r Alan Terry (2008) provides an interesting starting point for this section in his \nanalysis of a DIFID funded programme, in South Africa which ran from 1998-2001.  \nThe Community Sustainable Development Indicators Project was part of a larger set of \nprogrammes run under UN Habitat that sought to link improving quality of life in the \nGlobal South to improving local governance structures.  Community led indicator \nprogrammes were to be part of the project in Sobantu a black township in \nPietermaritzburg, South Africa.  In many ways the story Terry tells mirrors the cases \ndetailed above from the initial swell of support for SI development from the local \ncommunity with the requisite positive \u2018soft\u2019 outcomes like capacity building and \nempowerment, to the ultimate \u2018workshop fatigue\u2019 and loss of interest in the indicators, \nwhich have stymied their use.  So, on the surface, this seems a description like so many \nothers of programmes that began well and then petered out through lack of interest and \npolitical will.  What Terry offers that is different in his analysis of why this programme \nfailed is an explanation centred on poor relationships between communities and service \nproviders\/ local politicians and how these negatively impacted indicator use.  Here \nTerry lays the blame for programme failure not at the door of the local community who \ndid not want to challenge poorly performing politicians, rather he highlights the failings \nof UK programme mangers who, assuaged proper contact and buy-in from local \npoliticians and service providers at the development stage in order to maintain a purely \ncommunity-led project (2008: p. 232).   This failing calls our attention to the importance \nthat relationships of trust and networks built over time can have in creating functional \npolicy environments by aiding connectivity outside the local network that helps to \n\u2018brace\u2019 governing coalitions together offering local actors better opportunities to interact \n(Holman, 2007; Rydin & Holman 2004).  Here, if properly handled, SIs can be seen as \nportals that help to open up avenues of dialogue between tiers of government (Journel et \nal, 2003) and to shape networks more broadly (Alstleithner et al, 2004).  This point is \nalso beautifully echoed in the work of Hezri et al (2006) and Hezri (2004) who discuss \nthe case of sustainable development policy integration in Malaysia.  Whilst they do not \nfind an overly positive picture of this process, they do highlight that SIs have played an \nexperimental role in fledgling developments into horizontal policy integration by \nhelping to shape institutional arrangements (Hezri et al, 2006; Hezri, 2004).   \n\t\n\r Going back to the work of Terry (2008), he also makes a potentially even more \ninteresting observation about the affect indicators can have on local governing \narrangements especially in terms of the mediation of relationships between the central \nand local levels of government.  He does this, not through his analysis of why the SIs \nfailed in the Sobantu case, but in his prediction of why these locally chosen indicators \nmay regain their importance under the new planning framework South Africa has \nadopted.  Here the passage of the Local Government Municipal Systems Act comes into \nplay.  This Act calls for the development and adoption of municipal Integrated \nDevelopment Plans, which must take into account community participation in the \nadministration, budgeting and management of local areas.  In effect this act, in neo-\nFoucauldian terms, will help to \u2018responsibilise\u2019 local governments in much the same \nway municipalities in the Global North find themselves monitored and measured \nthrough governmental technologies designed to gauge their performance (See for \nexample Vincent-Jones 2002; Rydin 2007).  Indicators here play a role in this mediation \nbut can also act as sites of local resistance so, as Rydin rightly notes, any use of the \ngovernmentality framework must allow for a proper consideration of agency and \nconflict in the construction of objects (like sustainable development) and their subjects \n(in this case communities and local governments) (2007: p.621).\n\t\n\r Two other articles falling into this category also offer some intriguing insights \ninto how SIs can be used to alter and strengthen local governing arrangements all the \nwhile providing a platform upon which the contested nature of sustainable development \ncan be discussed.  Holden (2006) provides an interesting account of the history of the \nSustainable Seattle programmes from their inception in the early 1990s through four \nclearly defined iterations of projects until 2006.  In this article she challenges the \ndominant view that the impact of Sustainable Seattle was felt mostly greatly outside the \nlocal area or as she puts it received wisdom dictates that \u201c...the farther one sits from \nSeattle, the more likely one is to consider (it) an influential project\u201d (IBID: p.254).  She \ndoes this by carefully tracing the history of each phase of the indicator project carried \nout in Seattle and explaining how these all have added to the acceptance and \ninstitutionalisation of sustainable development in the city.  Here Holden proposes a sort \nof network that forms over time between projects and the actors involved in those \nprojects creating \u201cdirect and indirect ties from (Sustainable Seattle) to (the) newer \nindicator projects, (which) constitute the local legacy...\u201d (2006: p.266).  In many ways \nthis reflects Sirianni\u2019s findings on the collaborative governing culture that arose in \nSeattle over this same period (Sirianni, 2007).  The important thing to take away from \nthis experience is the role indicators have played in \u201cstarting the conversation\u201d between \nlayers of government and other actors and their role in embedding sustainability into the \npolicy culture (Holden, 2006: p.268).  This again reflects the portal metaphor, where SIs \nact as a door to opening communication between actors and creating new linkages and \nnetworks between them.  This goes beyond the capacity building ideas prevalent within \nthe type two literature by specifically illustrating how the SIs have impacted on and \nshaped local governing arrangements over time.\n\t\n\r Keirstead and Leach (2007), offer a different take on the network concept by \nsuggesting what they call a service niche approach to SI use and development.  In this \nmanner, they propose to target indicator programmes at specific urban services like \nenergy, transport, waste and water that are already goal-driven and target oriented where \nclear policy synergies between service delivery and sustainability exist (IBID).  By \ndoing this they surmise that some of the ambiguity and over-ambitiousness most often \nassociated with sustainability can be avoided.  This problem of uncertainty was also \nhighlighted by Hajer and Versteeg (2005) in their work on discourse and environmental \npolitics.  Here they note that \u201cenvironmental debates often take place in a situation of \ninstitutional ambiguity, in which there are no generally accepted rules and norms \naccording to which policy is to be conducted and policy measures are to be agreed \nupon\u201d (IBID: p.182).  By adopting a service niche approach to indicator development \nKeirstead and Leach conclude that not only will policy ambivalence be avoided through \na more structured and directed approach to SIs, more importantly they believe \u201cif \ncarefully picked to ensure relevance to these wider debates, the experience gained in \nthese small indicator niches might then provide a stepping-stone to more elaborate \nevaluations of urban sustainability\u201d (IBID: Published on-line my emphasis).   The \ndirection then, is a network approach to embedding sustainability whereby \nenvironmental discussion within specific departments leads to the creation of modes of \nworking, rules, and concepts alongside a \u201c...thickening or discarding of meanings\u201d  \nabout sustainability that can then be dispersed more broadly (Hajer & Versteeg, 2005: p. \n176).  Again, the articulation here is scalar, building linkages across departments and \nembedding the concept of sustainability more widely with SIs acting as portals for this \nprocess.\nConcluding Remarks\n\t\n\r  The question that opened this article was -  How far have notions of governance \nbeen incorporated into current research into indicators?  Through the examination of a \nselected set of recent articles on SIs this paper has found that although progress is being \nmade regarding measurement, the conceptualisation of complexity, and the capture of \n\u2018soft\u2019 indicator impact in two of the camps, an explicit understanding of governance is \nstill  missing the research.  In the third typology, connecting the dots, the linkages \nbetween indicator use and the effects this has on shaping governing arrangements is \nmuch more apparent.  Miller in his 2005 article comparing five projects designed to \ndevelop and use sustainability indicators makes a compelling argument here.  He states \nthat SIs are \u201cimportant new experiments in governance\u201d that may be transformational \nnot only to our identities as planners, politicians, or communities but also to the \nrelationships that are shaped between us (p. 405).  This is a good starting point for our \nconclusions as it opens out debates about what we as planners and academics can take \naway from these discussions and use in our professional lives.   \n\t\n\r The first lesson here is that sustainability is socially constructed and essentially \nthis makes it a messy and muddy field of play.  Jordon (2008) points to a quote by \nDonaella Meadows, the author of The Limits of Growth that reflects this notion \nbrilliantly; she observed that the debate about what constituted sustainable development \nwas a \u201cmess\u201d  but she also pointed out that any \u201cgreat social transformation\u201d was by its \nvery nature messy (p.28).  So, here, indicators play their role in developing and \nconstructing what it means to \u2018do\u2019 sustainability; they help us to frame our discussion.  \nThey act as \u201ckey site(s) of innovation in which people are working out new conceptual \nmodels of nature and society\u201d (Miller, 2005: p.405).   Given this perhaps, the service \nniche approach proposed by Keirstead and Leach (2007) does offer a useful tool for \ncreating boundaries and parameters around which the social construction of \nsustainability can take place.  However, it is also very important to note that other \nstudies (e.g. Holden, 2006) have shown that indicator programmes can help to construct \nmeaningful dialogues about sustainability that do become embedded institutionally over \ntime despite a lack of strict boundary specification.  The core factor  here is that we \nmust enter into these discussions with open eyes, understanding that they are messy but \nalso realising over time that notions of sustainable development can become embedded \ninto the governing culture.  We do, however, have to play our part in guiding and \nshaping the discourse.\n\t\n\r This institutional embedding opens up the second and perhaps most important \npoint that is raised in this literature review.  That is that there are explicit linkages bound \nup in the discourses of sustainability that come out of the creation of SIs and the \ndynamics of governance tied to their use.  In many respects indicators here act as portals \nof communication that create the need for cross departmental, cross community, cross \nparty discussion and thereby \u201cshape networks\u201d (Alstleithner et al, 2004).  It is here in \nthis shaping of networks that studies in the third camp move beyond \u2018soft\u2019 impacts and \ninto conceptualisations of governance.  Moreover through this continual discussion, \nframing, and re-framing of sustainability brought about by their use the concept itself \nbecomes commonplace and normalised.  In this context,  SIs are not being used as a \ntechnology of command and control or accountability, rather they function as a \ntechnology of visibility making various aspects of sustainable development more \neminent (Miller, 2005: p.425).  Thus the key concept for planners and other urban \nprofessionals is to recognise and act upon opportunities to open dialogues with groups \ncentred on SIs.  By forging new relationships we create new opportunities for trust and \nnetworks to emerge; it is only through the extension and strengthening of these \nnetworks of trust that dynamic and healthy policy communities can emerge.\nAstleithner, F., Hamedinger, A., Holman, N., & Rydin, Y.
