Introduction \nThe decline in farmland biodiversity over the last 50 years in Europe and North \nAmerica has been widely attributed to the intensification of agriculture (Krebs et al., \n1999; Robinson and Sutherland, 2002; Green et al., 2005). This decline has been \n- page 2 - \naddressed by encouraging farmers and landowners to adopt agri-environment schemes \n(AES), through which they are subsidised to implement less intensive practices. In \n2005 AES covered over 25% of farmland in the EU15 countries (EU, 2005) and 13% \nin England (Defra, 2007). This approach has also included support for organic \nfarming, which accounted for 3.9% of the total agricultural area of the EU (EU, 2007) \nand 3.0% of England in 2005 (Defra, 2006a). \nThe monitoring of the impact of European AES has been limited (Whitfield, 2006), \nand the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) scheme in the UK resulted in only \nmarginal increases in biodiversity according to Kleijn and Sutherland, (2003) and \nWilson et al., (2007). Studies have indicated that organic farming benefits biodiversity \n(Bengtsson et al., 2005; Fuller et al., 2005), with greater numbers and\/or diversity of \nbats (Wickramasinghe et al., 2003), birds (Chamberlain et al., 1999), butterflies \n(Rundl\u00f6f and Smith, 2006; Feber et al., 2007), carabid beetles (Kromp, 1989; Pfinner \nand Niggli, 1996) and plants (Gabriel and Tscharntke, 2007; Boutin et al., 2008). \nHowever, these studies have mainly been based on comparing organic farms with \nconventional farms at the same point in time, often using a paired farm approach. \nInterpretation of these results are complicated by the possibility that organic farms may \nbe predisposed to support higher biological diversity if they have greater habitat \nheterogeneity and already favourable management compared to other farms (Krebs et \nal., 1999; Fuller et al., 2005; Rundl\u00f6f and Smith, 2006). There has usually been a lack \nof baseline data and long-term monitoring before, during and after transition (Kleijn \nand Sutherland, 2003; Hole et al., 2005; Kleijn et al., 2006). A long-term perspective \nwould be valuable because many ecological processes are slow and sensitive to \nweather conditions that can cause large inter-annual variability in some animal and \nplant communities. \n- page 3 - \nTo our knowledge, no studies have followed a farm through conversion to organic \nstatus, quantifying changes in a wide range of biodiversity, with several years data \nbefore and after the change. Organic conversion and adoption of agri-environment \nmeasures under an ESA scheme at Wytham Estate, Southern England, in the middle of \na long-term ecosystem monitoring programme, provided a unique opportunity to do \nthis. \nLong-term monitoring of a wide range of variables has taken place at Wytham under \nthe UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) long term monitoring programme \n(www.ecn.ac.uk) since 1992. ECN was established to detect long-term environmental \nchange at a series of intensively monitored sites across the UK and is part of the \nInternational Long Term Ecological Research (ILTER) network. Monitoring includes \nphysical aspects of the environment, particularly climate, hydrology and air pollution, \nas well as a wide range of organisms and records of land management. Until \nSeptember 2001, the farmland on the estate was managed as a commercial mixed farm, \nwith no participation in any AES. In 2002, the farm introduced organic management \nand part of the site was incorporated into an ESA scheme covering the flood plain of \nthe River Thames.  This resulted in an increase in the area of grassland, a decrease in \nlivestock numbers and the cessation of artificial fertiliser, herbicide and pesticide \napplications (Table 1). This reflected a wider trend across the UK where there has been \na 14% decrease in head of stock per hectare and a 30% reduction in fertiliser use over a \nsimilar time frame (Defra, 2006b). Grasslands have been targeted in AES in a number \nof European countries, including Denmark, Germany and Switzerland (Kleijn and \nSutherland, 2003) and North America (Grassland Reserve Program). In the UK, the \nUpper Thames Tributaries ESA encouraged arable reversion and rotations using \nperennial leys \u2013 in 2004 70% of the farmland was grass (Philip Riordan, pers. comm.). \n- page 4 - \nAs the ESA scheme and organic conversion were implemented at a similar time it is \nhard to separate their effects on the biodiversity. However, details of specific schemes \ndiffer over time and between different regions and countries. The changes that took \nplace at Wytham are typical of many such schemes and are best interpreted in a \ngeneric way, rather than as a test of specific prescriptions. \nIn this paper we aim to address the following questions: \n1. Have there been any changes in the composition or abundance of the monitored \ntaxonomic groups? \n2. If so, what evidence is there that the changes can be attributed to changes in land \nmanagement rather than other factors, such as weather? \nThe wider series of ECN sites has allowed us to compare Wytham with other sites in \nthe network, which have not experienced the same change in management, using \nstandardised monitoring methods.  \n2. Materials & Methods \nWytham Estate (1\u00b020\u2019W 51\u00b046\u2019N; National Grid Reference SP 462082) is 5 km \nnorthwest of the city of Oxford and is owned by Oxford University. The farmland \ncovers 374ha and is bounded in part by the River Thames, at an altitude of \napproximately 60 m O.D. The land adjacent to the River Thames is on alluvial soils: \nMax and Fladbury Series in the England and Wales Soil Survey Classification \n(Clayden and Hollis, 1984), with much of the rest on heavy clay soils (Folksworth and \nDenchworth Series). The farmland is partially bounded by a forest area, Wytham \nWoods, which is also monitored within the ECN programme. Prior to the change in \nmanagement (1994 to 2001), the area of grassland, crops grown, agrochemical inputs \nand grazing intensity did not change substantially.  \n- page 5 - \n(TABLE 1) \n2.1. Monitoring \nECN methods are described in detail by Sykes and Lane (1996); those relevant to this \npaper are summarised below. The data used in this study were from the beginning of \n1994 to the end of 2006. \nGrassland productivity was measured in ten 2 x 1.5 m plots using wire cages to \nexclude grazing. Plots were re-sited at random in March each year, within ten 30 x 25 \nm grid plots in permanent pasture. The sward was cut four times a year from mid-May \nto the end of October, the fresh yield weighed for each plot and a sub-sample dried to \ngive dry matter productivity; plant species present in each exclosure plot were \nrecorded each July before the second cut. The grassland received a mean rate of 265 kg \nN\/ha\/year previous to 2002. Plant species presence was also recorded in July in three \n10 x 10 m vegetation monitoring plots, each containing ten 0.4 x 0.4 m randomly \nplaced, permanently marked quadrats. \nButterfly populations were monitored weekly, from 1 April to 29 September, on a \nfixed 3.55 km transect, divided into 13 different sections at field boundaries, following \nthe method of Pollard and Yates (1993). All butterflies present within 2.5 m to each \nside and 5 m in front of the observer were recorded. Transects were only walked in dry \nweather with temperatures >13\u00b0C if cloud cover was less than 60%, or >17\u00b0C in more \ncloudy conditions. The transect comprised of cropped (prior to 2002) and grassland \nhabitats and, in parts, deciduous woodland edge, river bank, hedgerows and a field \nmargin established in 1987. Macro-moths were monitored nightly, between dusk and \ndawn, using a Rothamsted Insect Survey light-trap (Woiwood and Harrington, 1994), \nlocated in a fixed position in the middle of the farm. \n- page 6 - \nCarabid beetle populations were sampled using ten pitfall traps at 10 m intervals on a \npermanent transect beside a hedgerow, with a track and permanent pasture on one side \nand a 2 m wide field margin (which was present at the start of the monitoring) and \ncropped field on the other. The traps (plastic cups sunken to ground level containing \nundiluted ethylene glycol, with covers and wire mesh to exclude rain and small \nmammals) were emptied every two weeks from the first week of May to the end of \nOctober. The data, an index of activity density, were compared with those from two \nsimilar transects in adjacent woodland. \nBats were recorded on an 850 m transect through agricultural fields and compared with \nanother transect (500 m) along a nearby woodland \/ riverbank boundary. The transects \nwere walked four times each year in four three- week periods between 15 June and 7 \nSeptember, in dry weather conditions, starting 30 min. after sunset. A Batbox \nIII\/Batbox Duet (Batbox Ltd, Steyning, UK) was used to identify the bat calls to \nspecies and activity levels measured using the number of bat passes.  \nData for butterflies, moths and carabids were compared with national trends. Eight \nECN sites with comparable records for the same period of time were used to provide \nindices of national trends, independent of local changes in management.  They include \na wide range of agricultural and semi-natural habitats across the UK (www.ecn.ac.uk).  \nIn addition to the standard ECN methods, butterfly larval food plants were recorded in \n2001 and 2006. Each of the 13 butterfly transect sections was split into 10 m sub-\ndivisions and the presence of food plant species were recorded to give an objective \nmeasure of frequency for each section. To account for varying section lengths, all data \nrecorded on the butterfly transect were scaled to 100 m of section length. \n- page 7 - \nThe nomenclature for vascular plants followed Stace (1997), for butterflies Lewington \n(2003), moths Waring and Townsend (2004), beetles (Duff, 2008) and for bats Jones \nand Walsh (2006). \n2.2. Data analysis \nRegression analyses were used to examine temporal changes in grassland productivity, \nplant species richness, abundance and species richness of butterflies, moths and \ncarabid beetles, and number of bat observations. Analyses were also carried out on all \nbutterfly species recorded and the five most common moth and carabid beetle species.  \nThree potential types of change were tested: \na) Incremental change following the change in management (linear increase or \ndecrease 2002 \u2013 2006)  \nb) Step change, following the change in management (change in level between 2001 \nand 2002) \nc) Incremental change independent of change in management (linear increase or \ndecrease from 1994 to 2006)  \nA structured approach was taken, using four statistical models. \nModel 1 tested for  \ny = a + bt + cz + dw (1) \ny being the dependent variable (for example butterfly abundance), t the year, z a \nparameter management change, z = 0 for t \u2264 2001 or = 1 for t > 2001, w a \nmeasurement of time lapsed since management change (w = z * t), a, b, c, d fitted \nparameters. \n- page 8 - \nSignificant effects of w and level z indicated that there was both a step change and a \nsubsequent incremental change in y following transition. In this case the results of this \nanalysis only are reported.  \nIf Model 1 showed that only w was significant, a second model (Model 2) was used to \ntest for a change in trend since the changes in management in 2001, without a stepped \nchange: \ny = a + bt + cw (2) \nIf only z was significant in Model 1, then Model 3 was used to test for a stepped \nchange, but no subsequent trend: \ny = a + bt + cw (3) \nSignificant results from Models 2 and 3 are reported. \nIf neither w nor z were significant in Model 1, Models 2 and 3 were checked to see if \nthere were significant effects of w and z without t, and if so, the significant model is \nreported. If not, Model 4 (y = a + bt) was used to test whether there was any significant \nlinear trend with time through the whole data set from 1994 to 2006. Variables that \nwere not significantly related to any variables with any of the models have not been \nreported. \nTrends in air temperature and precipitation for summer (June, July, August) and the \nprevious 12-months (September to August) were investigated using the same models. \nRegression analyses were also used to test the relationship between the abundance of \nthe different invertebrate groups and weather variables. The change in number of larval \nfood plant species was tested using a t-test. All statistical analyses were performed \nusing Systat 11 (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA, USA). \n- page 9 - \n3. Results \n3.1 Vegetation \nGrassland productivity declined rapidly after nitrogen fertiliser applications ceased to \napproximately 50% of the yield before 2002 (Figure 1). Regression analysis of \nbiomass showed a significant change in level from 2002 (Model 3, R2 = 0.853, P = \n0.009). Plant species richness under the exclosure cages increased from a mean of 4.1 \nspecies per plot in 2001 to 6.5 in 2006 (Model 2, R2 = 0.806, P = 0.007). This trend \nwas also recorded in the three additional plots with mean number of species per plot \nincreasing from 5.7 (1998-2001) to 7.3 (2002-2006) (Model 2, R2 = 0.716, P = 0.035). \n(FIGURE 1) \nThe number of larval food plant species on the butterfly transect increased from a \nmean of 12.6 \u00b10.8 per section in 2001 to 17.2 \u00b10.8 in 2006 (t-test, P=<0.001), with 20 \nspecies increasing in occurrence and six declining (Table 2). Grass species, in \nparticular Festuca pratensis, increased in frequency, as did legumes such as Trifolium \nrepens and Medicago lupulina. Whilst, Cirsium arvense increased in occurrence, other \nweed species such as Cirsium vulgare and Urtica dioica slightly decreased, as did \nElytrigia repens and Poa annua.  \n(TABLE 2) \n3.2 Lepidoptera \nA total of 23 butterfly species have been recorded on the transect. Butterfly numbers \nsignificantly increased from 1994, the rising trend continuing through the changes in \nmanagement (Table 3). This result contrasted with the combined data from other ECN \nsites, which showed numbers peaking in the mid-1990\u2019s and declining subsequently \n(Fig. 2 a). At North Wyke, a lowland grassland ECN site which has not had any recent \n- page 10 - \nchange in farm management, there has been a significant decrease in numbers since \n1994 (R2 = 0.406, P = 0.026). \n(FIGURE 2) \n(TABLE 3) \nButterfly abundance at Wytham showed a positive relationship (R2 = 0.604, P = 0.002) \nwith September to August mean air temperature, but not current year summer (June \u2013 \nAugust) temperature or previous 12-month rainfall. \nOne new species (Aricia agestis) was recorded following 2001. The species richness of \nbutterflies per 100 m section significantly increased (Figure 3) over the whole period \nfrom 1994 (Model 4, R2 = 0.653, P = 0.001), indicating that species were colonising \nnew areas before and after the land management changes. There has been a significant \nincrease in the populations of five butterfly species since 2001, including Maniola \njurtina that made up over 50% of the total number of butterflies in 2006 compared \nwith 15% in 2001. Pieris napi has shown a significant decrease in abundance since \n2001, and P. brassicae a stepped decrease. A number of species have shown \nsignificant increases in numbers since the start of monitoring in 1994 (Table 3).  \n(FIGURE 3) \nSince 2001 there has been a 9% increase in the number of individual macro moths \ncaught at Wytham (Table 3). The other ECN sites have seen an overall decrease in \nmoth abundance of 23% since 1994, with an 89% decline at North Wyke. Up to 2003 \nthere was a similar pattern in the year to year changes between Wytham and the rest of \nthe ECN sites, for example, a peak in 1995 and 1996. Since 2003 there as been a \ndivergence in the trends (Figure 2b). Moth numbers showed a negative (R2 = 0.489, P \n= 0.008) relationship with 12-month total rainfall. \nThere has also been a significant increase in the number of moth species since 2001 \n(Table 3). The abundance of Noctuids significantly increased in the period 2002-2006 \n- page 11 - \ncompared to 1994-2001, while the number of Geometrids have remained steady, and \nother macro moth species have shown an increasing trend from the start of monitoring. \nEilema lurideola was the most common moth caught (7% of the total catch), followed \nby Luperina testacea, Agrochola lychnidis, Omphaloscelis lunosa and Idaea aversata. \nOf the five most common species, only O. lunosa showed a trend of increasing \nabundance (Table 3) after the management changes.  \n3.3 Carabids \nThere was no significant trend following 2001 in the number of individuals (Figure 2c) \nor species richness of carabid beetles trapped on the farmland at Wytham, although \nthere was a significant increase in number caught from 1994 onwards (Model 4, R2 = \n0.574, P = 0.040). This trend was not seen at other ECN sites, nor in two woodland \ntransects at Wytham. Carabid beetles were caught in higher numbers in warm summers \n(R2 = 0.318, P = 0.045). Compared with the woodland transects at Wytham, the \nfarmland traps caught relatively few beetles, although species richness was higher (49 \ndifferent species trapped since 1994 compared to 22 in ancient woodland). The high \nnumbers caught in 2003 were mostly due to increased Pterostichus melanarius which \nwas the most common species caught over the 13 years, followed by P. madidus, P. \ncupreus, Harpalus rufipes and Abax parallelepipedus (overall accounting for 81% of \nthe catch). Both H. rufipes and A. parallelepipedus increased significantly after 2001 \n(Model 2, R2 = 0.654, P = 0.009 and R2 = 0.476, P = 0.046, respectively). P. cupreus \nhas increased significantly from 1994 (Model 4, R2 = 0.640, P = 0.001). \n3.4 Bats \nThere has been an increase in the number of bat observations of Pipistrellus \npipistrellus and P. pygmaetus (Model 4, R2 = 0.440, P = 0.014) since 1994 on the \nfarmland and Myotis daubentonii (Model 4, R2 = 0.552, P = 0.004) on the riverside \ntransect (Figure 4); Pipistrellus spp. make up 70% of the total number of bats on the \n- page 12 - \nfarmland. No significant change has occurred since the management changes started in \n2001. \n (FIGURE 4) \n4. Discussion \nThe data clearly show enhancements in some aspects of biodiversity following \nchanges in land management. There is a problem of interpreting the results of long-\nterm monitoring programmes without a \u2018control\u2019. This is not, however, unique to this \nsort of study and has perhaps been best studied in the context of climate change \n(Rosenzweig et al., 2007). It is necessary both to demonstrate that results are consistent \nwith the effects which would be expected on the basis of theory and that there is no \nalternative, plausible explanation. In this case we can also compare the results of this \nstudy with others in which farms with contrasting management have been compared \nover shorter periods of time. Neither approach is perfect but the evidence is \nconsiderably strengthened when their results are consistent. There have been no other \nmajor perturbations which offer a plausible alternative explanation for all the changes \nat Wytham. The most likely is an effect of climate, and some groups do show \nrelationships to weather variables. However, there have been no significant change in \nair temperature and rainfall since 2001 and substantial inter-annual variability. Other \nincidental changes in management were much smaller than the changes in 2001 and \nmore localised. \nAn increase in plant species richness has been shown in a number of other studies on \norganic farms (Hald, 1999; van Elsen, 2000; Bengtsson et al., 2005; Boutin et al., \n2008), with the increases in species richness probably the result of the cessation of \nfertiliser and herbicide applications (Hyv\u00f6nen & Salonen, 2002). In permanent \n- page 13 - \ngrasslands this increase was primarily due to higher numbers of broad-leaved perennial \nplants, as has also been found in arable field studies (Hald, 1999; Boutin et al., 2008). \nThe change in larval food plants recorded on the butterfly transect partly reflects the \ncomposition of the sown conservation grass seed. The increase in legume species \ncolonising the grass sward is consistent with organic conversion (Van Elsen, 2000), \nresulting in reduced grassland productivity, because of a decline in available soil \nnitrogen.  \nNational monitoring schemes for butterfly (Fox et al., 2006) and moth populations \n(Conrad et al., 2006) have shown declining trends, similar to those for the other ECN \ndata. The difference between the local Wytham and national trends is consistent with \nan effect of changing management. All the butterfly species that have increased since \n2001 are widespread and common, but agricultural intensification has been implicated \nin the decline in many of these common species (Fox et al., 2001). L. phlaeas is one \nsuch species which anecdotal evidence suggests has now benefited from set-aside \n(Mike Wilkins, pers. comm.). M. jurtina is likely to have profited from the increased \narea of grassland and more extensive grazing providing greater food plant resources \nand improved breeding area. The increase in P. icarus reflects the increase in its \nleguminous food plants. A. agestis has probably expanded on to the agriculture fields \nfrom populations on the old field margins. The stepped decline in P. brassicae density \nfrom 2001 to 2002 is most likely because oilseed rape stopped being grown on the \nfarm (Feber et al., 1997). The increase in O. lunosa at Wytham may be a response to \nthe increased grassland area and grass species. \nThe greater moth abundance at Wytham is not likely to have benefited Pipistrellus spp. \nwhich feed on smaller prey. Wickramasinghe et al. (2003) reported higher bat activity \non organic than conventional farms, but no difference in Pipistrellus spp. activity.  \n- page 14 - \nThere is some evidence of a divergence in trends between carabids on the Wytham \nfarm transect and other ECN sites and Wytham woodland transects which, together \nwith the increases in some species after 2001, suggest a beneficial effect of AES. \nPurtauf et al. (2005) found no difference in carabid species richness or activity density \nbetween organic and conventional farms. However, Andersen and Eltun (2000) found \nH. rufipes increased with organic conversion. It is primarily a seed predator, notably of \ngrass seeds, and the increase in grassland might explain the increased catch numbers. \nPitfall trapping is widely used for monitoring carabids and there is evidence that it is a \nrobust technique (Standen, 2000). It does however reflect activity as well as population \nsize and the transect at Wytham covers only a small part of the farm, making results \nsusceptible to small-scale changes in vegetation structure around the transect itself.  \nAn increasing temperature trend could potentially explain the longer term trends as \nmany invertebrates are promoted by warm (and dry) conditions (Morecroft et al., \n2002). Temperature has generally increased in recent decades, however the increase \nfrom 1994 to 2006 was not significant because of several warm years towards the start \nof the period. If temperature were a major factor, the increases in invertebrate \nabundance would also be expected to be across ECN, but this has not been the case. \nThe ECN monitoring at Wytham has provided a unique record of important aspects of \nfarmland biodiversity, before, during and after the adoption of AES and organic \nmanagement. There have been increases in the abundance and species richness of a \nnumber of the biological variables, which are best explained as a consequence of the \nchanges in management. In other cases increasing trends have continued in contrast to \nother ECN sites. Other aspects of ECN monitoring, such as climate, provide no \nalternative explanation for these enhancements to the biodiversity of the site. These \n- page 15 - \ndata also show that responses can be detected within a few years of a change in \nmanagement and continue to increase over at least a five year period.  \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank NERC for funding of the ECN programme at Wytham, Oxford University \nand the Food Animal Initiative for the use of the site, and the other ECN sites, in \nparticular North Wyke, for use of their summary data.
