Barth et al.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nEurope has historically been a hotspot of environmental\npressures and continues to be so because of its demographic\nand industrial developments. In order to better understand\npollutant behaviour in a comprehensive way and meet the chal-\nlenges of environmental impacts, the EU integrated Project\nAquaTerra was established. The full title of the project is \u201cIn-\ntegrated modeling of the river-sediment-soil-groundwater sys-\ntem; advanced tools for the management of catchment areas\nand river basins in the context of global change\u201d. The pri-\nmary objective of this project is to lay foundations for a better\nunderstanding of the behavior of environmental pollutants and\ntheir fluxes with respect to climate and land use changes. Envi-\nronmental topics cover a wide range of disciplines form about\n250 researchers across Europe and the study areas are the\ncatchments of the Ebro, Meuse, Elbe and Danube Rivers and\nthe Br\u00e9villes Spring (Fig. 1).\nThe scales of investigation range from the laboratory bench\nto river basins and research results bear the potential to pro-\nvide enhanced soil and groundwater monitoring as well as\nearly identification and forecasting of impacts on water quan-\ntity and quality, and with that, improved river basin man-\nagement. Within this context, the project performs research\nas well as modeling and quantifies deposition, sorption and\nturnover rates that lead to developments of numerical mod-\nels. These include fluxes and trends in soil water and sediment\nfunctioning.\nAquaTerra was one of the first environmental projects\nwithin the 6th Framework programme by the European Com-\nmission and counts among the largest environmental research\nprojects worldwide. Work began in June 2004 and brought\ntogether a multidisciplinary team of 45 partner organiza-\ntions from 13 EU countries, Switzerland, Serbia and Mon-\ntenegro. The project has already made significant impacts\nto global environmental research within the first three years\nof its existence. For instance, close to 2000 environmental\nsamples have been collected so far across Europe and, to-\ngether with historical results and new environmental concepts,\nhave led to close to 400 deliverable reports with novel en-\nvironmental information. These reports make up about 9000\npages containing new information about pollutant behaviour\nin times of rapid environmental change. In part, these deliv-\nerable reports are made publicly available on the AquaTerra\nwebsite that also provides constantly updated information\nat http:\/\/www.eu-aquaterra.de\/. These together with the non-\npublic deliverables are used as a basis for further scientific\npublications and high quality environmental databases. Pub-\nlication activities are mostly documented by the so far 104 fi-\nnalised peer-reviewed articles in internationally high ranking\njournals, 10 book chapters, and a large amount of public press\nappearances including TV, radio and newspapers (cf. reference\nlist on AquaTerra website).\nThe AquaTerra team also just completed a special issue in\nthe journal Environmental Pollution with the title \u201cAquaTerra:\npollutant behavior in the soil, sediment, ground, and surface\nwater system\u201d (Baborowski et al., 2007; Baran et al., 2007;\nBarth et al., 2007a; Bleeker and van Gestel, 2007; B\u00fcrger et al.,\n2007; Graf et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2007; Joubert et al., 2007;\nKalbus et al., 2007; Klaver et al., 2007; Kolditz et al., 2007;\nLabandeira et al., 2007; Morasch et al., 2007; Petelet-Giraud\net al., 2007; Poot et al., 2007; Rozemeijer and Broers, 2007;\nSlob et al., 2007; Vanbroekhoven et al., 2007; Vijver et al.,\n2007; Vink and Meeussen, 2007; Visser et al., 2007). This\nspecial issue covers topics including pollutant transfer from\ngroundwater to surface waters, storage and turnover of heavy\nmetals and persistent organic pollutants in soils and aquifers,\nrecharge and climate change impacts. The global impact of\nthe project is also maintained through special sessions at lead-\ning conferences. For instance the AquaTerra special session at\nthe 9th International ConSoil conference in Bordeaux in Oc-\ntober 2005 was heralded as a significant success and set trends\nfor research and management directions in Europe. Another\nnewly planned special workshop \u201cContaminant dynamics in\nperiodically flooded soils\u201d in the international Workshop at the\nEUROSOIL Congress in Vienna (August, 2008) is expected to\nhave a similar impact on the environmental research commu-\nnity.\nThe large amount and diversity of information produced by\nAquaTerra, with its new results and investigation techniques,\nis worth a review in its own right. Even though often con-\nducted at a local scale, results and techniques presented here\nare particularly important because new information can be\ntransferred to other case studies elsewhere. Overall, AquaTerra\nis a good example of international collaboration, with scien-\ntific approaches extending across boundaries. In addition, the\nAquaTerra project is one of the few environmental projects to\ninclude socio-economic issues. This includes plans to link sci-\nentific results to stakeholder needs and policy makers. One of\nthe central outcomes of the project is that environmental issues\nneed to be evaluated for the system as a whole within interdis-\nciplinary approaches.\n2. CONSORTIUM AND PROJECT STRUCTURE\nAND THEIR ORGANISATION\nThe challenge of managing a large integrated project such\nas AquaTerra is met through the organisational structure of the\nproject and its division into 11 sub-projects (Barth and Fowler,\n2005; Gerzabek et al., 2007). The latter are again divided into\nwork packages. For instance, the sub-project BASIN consti-\ntutes a research platform, which provides logistics for field-\nwork and, in part, access to historical data from the Ebro, Elbe,\nDanube and Meuse Basins, and the Br\u00e9villes Catchment. Two\nother sub-projects, HYDRO and MONITOR, mainly provide\nnew inputs of hydrological and chemical data through analy-\nses of hydrological databases and models and chemical anal-\nyses and methods. These inputs are then taken up by the sub-\nprojects BIOGEOCHEM, FLUX, TREND and COMPUTE\nfor laboratory tests and further evaluation of input, storage,\nturnover and exchange of pollutants between compartments\nas well as modelling of specific cases for water and contam-\ninant transport. Potential global changes are then introduced\ninto this systems modelling approach by the first work pack-\nage in HYDRO, which produces scenarios of climate change\nMobility, turnover and storage of pollutants in soils, sediments and waters... 163\nFigure 1. Basins and catchments of work within the AquaTerra project. Map by D. Kuntz.\nso that their catchment-scale impacts can be better understood.\nFinally, socio-economic evaluations of such new results are\nthen developed through conceptual models and recommenda-\ntions in the sub-projects INTEGRATOR and EUPOL.\nIn order to maintain internal and external discussions of\nthe project and to disseminate results, a separate subproject\n(KNOWMAN) has organised various courses covering top-\nics on modelling, the fate of pollutants, socio-economic and\nlegal aspects and environmental trends. This subproject also\nprovides information on intellectual property rights as well as\nmaintaining the AquaTerra public website. Between February\n2006 and January 2007, 2311 Megabytes of data were up-\nloaded to the website and user statistics show the broad and\ninternational perception of AquaTerra with users from New\nZealand, Pakistan and Vietnam. A parallel internal web-based\ninformation forum (the AquaTerra Intranet) stores all relevant\ndata and activities, which are continuously updated for avail-\nability to project participants.\nTo allow good functioning of the entire project, the sub-\nproject PROMAN is responsible for the management of\nAquaTerra, including reviews of reports, gender action plans\nand measures for integration. It acts as the interface between\nthe European Commission and the project consortium in all fi-\nnancial and administrative issues and arranges the transferral\nof information and revised documents. This includes individ-\nual approaches to the partners as well as consultation by phone\nand e-mail. In addition, the logistics of regular AquaTerra\nmeetings are organised by the PROMAN team and include\nthe scientific technical realization of the work plan, reports\nand publications. This includes maintenance of a calendar\nfor forthcoming and past events as well as a \u201cWho is who\u201d\ndatabase that constitutes a useful overview of addresses and\nactivities of project participants.\nOverall, this structure is highly efficient for the conduct of\nenvironmental research that extends across boundaries and en-\nvironmental compartments. It enables an innovative and more\nthorough global understanding of the soil, sediment, ground\nand surface water system. Furthermore, the project structure\nprovides excellent opportunities for all partners to gain high\nquality experience of state-of-the-art environmental methods\nin other laboratories across Europe. This is particularly ex-\nploited by young researchers, who on several occasions re-\nceived scholarships to work in other counties based on their\nAquaTerra work.\n3. OBJECTIVES OF THE WORK AND GENERAL\nACHIEVEMENTS\nWith the fundamental mission of gaining improved under-\nstanding of the river-sediment-soil-groundwater system, par-\nticipants focus on identifying relevant processes and quantify-\ning their associated parameters. The study areas within Europe\nall have their own characteristics in terms of environmental\nconcerns, climatological and demographic conditions. Within\nthis context, the goal is to achieve a better understanding of\npollutant dynamics in river basins as a whole to achieve po-\ntential transferral of results and techniques. This allows us to\nquantify the interaction and pollutant transfer between the var-\nious compartments (atmosphere, soils, sediments ground- and\nsurface waters). New scientific results can then lead to im-\nproved environmental management tools and conceptual mod-\nels for environmental planning on larger scales.\nSelected achievements include:\n\u2022 The establishment of fifteen new databases so far with hun-\ndreds of environmental parameters about specific environ-\nmental pollutants.\n\u2022 Active links to other environmental projects. This is\nachieved through several avenues such as participation at\n164 J.A.C. Barth et al.\nother EU project meetings (RISKBASE, SWIFT, NOR-\nMAN, Harmoni-CA, Modelkey) and national activities as\nwell as presenting AquaTerra at international conferences.\n\u2022 International courses on unifying themes such as modeling\nand software demonstration, trends in the Elbe Basin, so-\ncioeconomic and legal issues and biogeochemical themes\nincluding sorption of organic pollutants versus biodegra-\ndation.\n\u2022 Documents such as the AquaTerra Glossary (that explains\nmore than 2000 specialist terms) to allow further integra-\ntion within the project.\nIn the following section the key achievements will be listed\ngrouped by sub-project. In all cases direct beneficiaries in-\nclude the global environmental research community who re-\nceives new environmental monitoring and laboratory tech-\nniques together with highly relevant results and conclusions.\nFor instance, AquaTerra has further developed high-resolution\nmonitoring techniques such as passive samplers for ultra-low\nconcentration measurements. Through these techniques it has\nbecome increasingly evident that most pollutants are ubiqui-\ntously present in the environment and, in many cases, stored\nfor long time periods that range from decades to millen-\nnia. Other findings have confirmed that pollutants are often\nbuffered by soils, while their mobility is mainly controlled by\nthe aqueous phase such as ground- and\/or surface water.\n3.1. Diffuse pollution and hotspots, logistics for\nfieldwork, provision of data in collaboration with\nother subprojects through the subproject BASIN\nResearch in the Br\u00e9villes catchment focuses mainly on pes-\nticides and their turnover in the subsurface (Baran et al., 2007;\nMorvan et al., 2006; Roulier et al., 2006). Work has led to\nan extensive database with chemical data, information on land\nuse as well as a detailed description of the aquifer and hy-\ndrological setting. The Br\u00e9villes catchment belongs to a wider\naquifer system of about 12 km2 that constitutes a closed sys-\ntem. The area has been investigated by questioning farmers\nabout pesticide and fertilizer use, the installation of a total\nof 20 piezometers, tracer tests, microbiological investigations\nand the development of numerical models simulating water\nand material transport. The local spring, previously an impor-\ntant source for local water supply, was disconnected from the\ndistribution network in August 2001 because pesticide and ni-\ntrate concentrations exceeded water quality limits. Continued\nresearch on this system shows that pesticides such as atrazine\nwith an application ban in 1999 (4 years before the official ban\nin France) can be found with its metabolites in groundwater\nyears after their application and in the spring without any sig-\nnificant decrease (Fig. 2). This suggests persistence and slow\ntransport of this molecule and its related compounds in the\nsubsurface. Scaling up such pollution problems to catchment\nand basin scales would likely cause even longer time periods\nfor pesticide turnover in subsurface environments.\nIn the Ebro Basin, several detailed monitoring campaigns\nhave been carried out since 2004 for ground- and surface wa-\nter as well as sediment and soil samples (Eljarrat et al., 2004,\n2005b; Lacorte et al., 2006; Lucas et al., 2006). This has led\nto analyses of a total of 70 contaminants. Focus was put on\nthe determination of potential contamination sources includ-\ning a textile industry, a tannery and several other production\nfactories. The Flix risk area near Zaragoza initiated specific\nwork for the study of novel dioxins and dioxin-like compounds\nin fish (Eljarrat et al., 2005a), while the contamination by\nnew brominated flame retardants was monitored at the Cinca\nrisk area. A comprehensive survey of pharmaceutical residues\nin the Ebro Basin included the monitoring of several pomi-\nble point sources (wastewater treatment palnts in Zarggosa,\nLogr\u00f5no, Pamplona, Lleida, Vitoria, Miranda, Tudela) (Gros\net al., 2007). Another specific study was conducted by evaluat-\ning chemical and biological effects, including data interpreta-\ntion of environmental hazards caused by pesticides on the wa-\nter flea at the risk zone of the Ebro Delta (Barata et al., 2007).\nWork also included high-resolution statistical assessment with\ngeographic information systems and led to several new publi-\ncations about basin-wide pollutant evaluations (Navarro et al.,\n2006; Terrado et al., 2006; Terrado et al., 2007a, b).\nIn the Meuse Basin, new case studies applied a model\npredicting pore water composition in flood plain soils. The\nmodel includes an ecotoxicological module that models inver-\ntebrate and plant uptake. These studies revealed that risks de-\npend mainly on the type of land use, habitat and key plant\nspecies (Bernhard et al., 2005; Vink and Meeussen, 2007).\nOn the other hand, modern hydrogeological experiments at a\npollution hotspot of a former cokery near Li\u00e8ge consisted of\nhydraulic- and tracer tests to quantify hydrodynamic and dis-\npersive properties of the local alluvial gravel aquifer to evalu-\nate groundwater fluxes at the aquifer-river interface. Together\nwith results of bioassays and chemical analyses on sediments\nand suspended solids of sampling locations along the Belgian\nMeuse, this helped to estimate biogenic capacity and toxic ef-\nfects (Morasch et al., 2007; Vanbroekhoven et al., 2007). Fur-\nther groundbreaking work on the Geer sub-basin of the Meuse\nled to the prediction of mobility of pollutants and fertilisers\nover an entire catchment (Brouy\u00e8re, 2006).\nWork in the Elbe Basin has investigated the floodplains\nin the Czech Republic next to Les Kralovstvi Reservoir with\nre-suspended load that was polluted by mineral oil. Further\ndownstream, near Magdeburg, sediments of floods were col-\nlected with novel trap mats to be further investigated together\nwith soil samples. This revealed important new dynamics\nof pollutant transgression of contaminants such as cyclo-\u03b2-\nhexachlorohexane, a derivative of the herbicide lindane. At\nthe same site, depth-specific soil water samples were col-\nlected for the determination of pollutant flux and transforma-\ntions of organic and inorganic pollutants on the passage from\nsoils via groundwater to surface water (Baborowski et al.,\n2007; Graf et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2007). In the Bitterfeld\nregion, other specific investigations of pollutant transfer on\nthe passage from ground- to surface water were combined\nwith piezometric and temperature measurements and an inte-\ngral pumping test as well as isotope analyses to reveal only\nminor pollutant input through groundwater (Petelet-Giraud\net al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2006). This is an unexpected but\nMobility, turnover and storage of pollutants in soils, sediments and waters... 165\nConcentration(\u00b5g\/l) \nDesethyl atrazine\nAtrazine\n04\/12\/200604\/12\/200504\/12\/200405\/12\/200305\/12\/200205\/12\/200105\/12\/200006\/12\/1999\n1.15\n1.1\n1.05\n1\n0.95\n0.9\n0.85\n0.8\n0.75\n0.7\n0.65\n0.6\n0.55\n0.5\n0.45\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\nFigure 2.

This included the collection of sediments, water, fish\nand benthic organisms from 30 stations in 6 different coun-\ntries along a 1150 km-stretch of the river between Vienna and\nthe Iron Gate Reservoir in Romania. This is not only a prime\nexample of excellent European collaboration but also led to a\nhighly complex database containing thousands of environmen-\ntal results and has already led to a publication about sediment\ntransport (Klaver et al., 2007). The work laid the foundations\nfor further monitoring campaigns on the Danube. Further work\nin the Danube Basin has focused on atmospheric deposition of\npersistent organic pollutants (POP) and comparative soil in-\nvestigations (Graf et al., 2007).\n3.2. Climatic variability and change, water balances,\nhydrological input data and their processing:\nthe HYDRO sub-project\nThe HYDRO team of AquaTerra have developed a frame-\nwork for probabilistic scenarios of climate change for impact\nassessment and the reproduction of climate variable statis-\ntics using downscaling techniques (Fowler et al., 2007a). The\nmethodology uses an assessment of climate model simulation\nof mean climate and extremes, such as droughts (Blenkinsop\nand Fowler, 2007a; Fowler et al., 2007a, c) and heavy rainfall\n(Fowler et al., 2007b) to weight model predictions of future\nchange. In addition, rainfall modelling techniques have been\nfurther developed to integrate into the downscaling framework\n(Burton et al., submitted) and sophisticated methods have been\nproduced to downscale in time from daily data, important\nfor impact studies (Botter et al., 2007; Fowler et al., 2007a;\nMarani and Zanetti, 2007) This methodological framework is\nnow being applied to the AquaTerra catchments in collabo-\nration with numerical modellers in COMPUTE and TREND\n(B\u00fcrger et al., 2007). This involves links to selected impact\nstudies (Fowler et al., 2007a) such as changes in drought fre-\nquencies in water supply regions of the UK (Blenkinsop and\nFowler, 2007b). Key rainfall modelling deficiencies in large\ncatchments have also been identified and improvements to op-\ntimization schemes have been made for models that were ap-\nplied to the Gallego Catchment in the Ebro Basin (B\u00fcrger\net al., 2007).\nA more local climatic focus was placed on the Br\u00e9villes\nCatchment by assessing water inputs and monthly water lev-\nels in 20 established piezometers. One interesting feature of\nthe climatic series is the progressive increase in rainfall from\nSeptember 1995 to August 2000 and a subsequent decrease af-\nter 2000, which was also observed in the aquifer and the spring\nwith a delay of two to three years. Further high-resolution geo-\nphysical investigations, tracer tests and determination of ma-\nterial properties were also carried out in the catchment and are\ncurrently being evaluated to constrain the subsurface hydrody-\nnamics of this densely instrumented catchment.\n3.3. Novel analytical methods and their application\nwith focus on emerging- and priority pollutants\nSeveral analyses were carried out on target priority and\nemerging contaminants for selected soil\/sediment and water\nsamples at temporal and spatial distributions relevant to the\nriver basin scale and water as well as soil quality (Van\nBeusekom et al., 2006). They included priority compounds\nfrom the directives 2006\/11\/CE and 2455\/2001\/EC and com-\nprised 20 organochlorine compounds, 8 polyaromatic hy-\ndrocarbons, 2 alkylphenols and 40 polybrominated diphenyl\nethers congeners as well as various pesticides and metabolites\nand approximately 30 pharmaceutically active compounds\n(Eljarrat and Barcelo, 2006; Eljarrat et al., 2004; Lacorte\net al., 2006; Ratola et al., 2006; Gros et al., 2007). Specific\n166 J.A.C. Barth et al.\nanalyses of selected pesticides with emphasis on compounds\nused in rice fields in the delta region of the Ebro and fur-\nther pesticides applied in the Br\u00e9villes Catchment (atrazine,\ndesethyl- and deisopropyl-AT, isoproturon, chlortoluron, ace-\ntochlor, acetochlor ethanesulfonic and oxanilic acid) in water\nand soil were also developed (Barata et al., 2007; Eljarrat et al.,\n2005a; Hildebrandt et al., 2007).\nFurther new analytical methods have included a multi-\nresidue method with liquid chromatography triple quadrupole\nand quadrupole time of flight mass spectromety for the de-\ntermination of a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds\nin the environment (Gros et al., 2007; Peschka et al., 2007).\nAnalyses have included anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics,\n\u03b2-blockers, lipid regulating agents, anti-histaminic and psy-\nchiatric drugs. In addition, new brominated flame-retardants\n(hexabromocyclododecane, decabromodiphenylethane) were\ndetected in environmental samples of the Ebro Basin and led\nto the advanced modelling of these compounds in the food\nchain (Eljarrat et al., 2004, 2005a, b; Lacorte et al., 2006; Van\nBeusekom et al., 2006).\nFurther new analyses of persistent organic pollutants with a\nfocus on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from field\ndeposition samplers and from sorption experiments were con-\nducted (Barth et al., 2007c; Gocht et al., 2007a, b; Turner\net al., 2006). A first calibration dataset for validation of pas-\nsive adsorption cartridges as a new method for time-integrated\nsurface water sampling of organic compounds was also de-\nveloped. This can become highly important for river water\nsampling where low concentrations of compounds in surface\nwaters still need to be analysed for flux considerations over\nlonger time periods. Passive samplers were also further de-\nveloped for additional compound groups and environmental\ncompartments. This work produced new data about the per-\nformance of passive air sampler designs for validation of, for\ninstance, brominated flame retardants (Harner et al., 2006).\n3.4. Transport, storage and turnover of organic\nand metal pollutants: a summary\nfrom the subproject BIOGEOCHEM\nPart of the team demonstrated the importance of colloids,\ndissolved organic matter and the role of micro organisms for\ncontaminant mobility in floodplains (Abelmann et al., 2005;\nWeber et al., 2007; Voegelin et al., 2007). They applied a com-\nbined approach of field lysimeters, laboratory microcosm and\nflow-through experiments. Flooding enabled the direct field\nsampling of contaminants including copper, cadmium, lead\nand polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The group further developed\nprotocols for the sampling of water-dispersible particles under\nreducing canditions and their characterization using TEM and\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy (Weber et al., 2007).\nFurthermore, sorption properties of selected field samples\nyielded an extensive list of solute descriptors for a wide range\nof organic compounds to enable rapid prediction of soil-water\ndistribution coefficients. Laboratory methods for sorption dy-\nnamics of polar compounds were also extended and led to the\ndetermination of sorption isotherms of 21 polar and non-polar\ncompounds. This is crucial to determine how rapidly pollu-\ntants can be released into the water and helps to quantify their\nmobility and availability for biodegradation. Another column\nexperiment to evaluate movement of pesticides through rocks\nwas performed and further coal petrography microscopy of\ncarbon phases in soil and sediment samples helped to define\nthe phases in soils and sediments that are responsible for sorp-\ntion.\nStatistical analyses further determined the impacts of tem-\nperature, pH, gas phase and microbial activity on inorganic\npollutants in the soil- and groundwater zone. The resulting\nequilibrium constants served to characterise soils and aquifer\nmaterial of the Dommel, Fl\u00e9malle and Gallego sites as ex-\namples for successful applications. Further studies of bac-\nterial biodiversity were performed with statistical analyses\nfor soil incubations and provided new relationships between\nthe bacterial community structure and, for instance, arsenic\nturnover while combined lysimeter experiments under vege-\ntation showed preferential flow of lead via particle transport\n(Joubert et al., 2007; Vanbroekhoven et al., 2007).\nMicrobiological work revealed new functional activities\nand composition of microbial communities throughout the\nBr\u00e9villes, Danube, Ebro and Elbe areas by applying new\nmolecular markers that respond to system perturbations such\nas changes in redox conditions, water saturation and pollution.\nLaboratory model systems including microcosms and sedi-\nment columns are currently applied to simulate various per-\nturbations under environmental conditions such as changing\ntemperature, redox, water saturation and influx of pollutants\nas typical environmental changes.\nOne important new finding of the microbiological team\nis that the sum of all nonylphenol (NP) isomers can serve\nas an indicator of estrogen pollution in sediments to char-\nacterise estrogenic activity response (de Weert et al., 2008).\nThey studied the bioavailability and biodegradability of NP\nTable I.

The bioavailable fraction was collected with Tenax\nTAr\u00a9 beads, and biodegradation was determined in aerobic\nbatch experiments. The presence of NP was analyzed chem-\nically using GC-MS and indirectly as estrogenic potency us-\ning an in vitro reporter gene assay (ER\u03b1-luc assay). Our study\nrevealed that 95% of the total extractable NP in the sediment\ndesorbed quickly into the water phase. By aerobic biodegrada-\ntion, the total extractable NP concentration and the estrogenic\nactivity were reduced with respectively 97\u00b10.5% and 94\u00b1 2%,\nMobility, turnover and storage of pollutants in soils, sediments and waters... 167\n87Sr\/86Sr\nFigure 3.

This shows that the easily biodegradable fraction\nequals the potential bioavailable fraction. Furthermore, 43% of\nthe estrogenic activity in the total extractable fraction, as de-\ntected in the ER\u03b1-luc assay, could be explained by the present\nNP concentration. This indicates that other estrogenic com-\npounds must be present and that their bioavailability and aer-\nobic degradation should be similar to that of NP. With this,\nthe use of NP as an indicator compound to monitor estrogenic\nactivity in Ebro sediment was proposed.\nThe microbiological team of AquaTerra also quan-\ntified degradation of a variety of organic compounds\nincluding atrazine, nonylphenol, DDT, vinylchloride,\n1,2-dichloroethane, chlorinated benzenes, brominated\nflame retardants, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAH),\natrazine, isoproturon, acetochlor under laboratory conditions.\nBiodegradation rates capacity may work differently in the\nfield, for which a novel compilation of changes in compound\nspecific stable isotope ratios was introduced as a suitable\nmonitoring tool to quantify degradation rates of organic\ncompounds (Barth et al., 2007c; Morasch et al., 2007). In the\nfield dechlorinating bacteria were detected and quantified.\nEspecially Dechalococcoides were detected in the presence of\nbaloorganic pollutants. This suggents that a high abundonce of\nthese bacteria can be used as an indication of contamination.\n3.5. Pollutant input, fluxes and exchanges between\ncompartments\nOn local scales such as for the Br\u00e9villes Catchment inter-\nviews with local farmers helped to assess present and past\npesticide inputs, while groundwaters were analysed for the\nsame compounds on a monthly basis (Baran et al., 2007). Fur-\nthermore, interaction between water bodies in the Br\u00e9villes\nTDS (mg\/L)\nFigure 4.

This reflects the influence of dams\nand their hampering of suspended matter exportations in Tortosa at\nthe outlet of the basin, where dissolved exportations largely domi-\nnate.\ncatchment could associate Sr from anthropogenic sources via\nunique isotope ratios and demonstrated the capacity of Sr iso-\ntopes to trace fertilizer contributions versus natural sources\n(Fig. 3).\nAnother local study characterised temperature- and inte-\ngral pumping tests for pollutant transfer determinations in the\nMulde Area in the Elbe Basin (Kalbus et al., 2007; Schmidt\net al., 2006). This led to definitions of spatial heterogeneity\nof ground- and stream water interactions that were also con-\nfirmed by isotope tracing with strontium and water isotopes\n(Petelet-Giraud et al., 2007).\nOn larger scales, sampling campaigns for major ions, trace\nelements and isotopes in the Ebro River, combined with his-\ntorical data, led to new quantifications of long-term suspended\nand dissolved matter (N\u00e9grel et al., 2007). This work is\nbest summarised in Figure 4 that evaluates suspended matter\nconcentrations versus total dissolved solids to outline influ-\nences of dams.\nThe Meuse River basin was investigated through a new\nlake sediment core, recording the major flood events, and the\nstudy of present suspended matter exportations in order to\ncompare the present and past SPM fluxes at the scale of the\nMeuse Basin. A sub-catchment of the Meuse, the Dommel,\nwas also studied for its surface- and groundwater dynamics\nwith novel methods including strontium, boron, lithium, cad-\nmium, zinc and lead isotopes. This helped to decipher the an-\nthropogenic sources (urban, industrial) and their behaviour at\nthe basin scale. Work within the FLUX subproject was fur-\nther accompanied by monitoring of suspended matter trans-\nport by novel acoustic methods. A new prototype near-bed hy-\ndrophone array provided high-resolution data during in-situ\n168 J.A.C. Barth et al.\nSorption capacity [Asorbed Value]\nFigure 5.

Further tests are now\nconsidered at selected AquaTerra sites and are expected to de-\nvelop into a fully-coupled sediment transport model that is\nleading for sediment transport in the field.\nFor comparison between basins, passive air and deposition\ndata were also collected for the areas of Br\u00e9villes, Danube,\nEbro, Elbe and Meuse catchments to cover a total period of\n24 months (Barth et al., 2007c). Sampling of soil and water\nwas finalized for the same areas and samples were prepared\nfor polyaromatic hydrocarbon analyses.\n3.6. Temporal spatial soil and groundwater\ndevelopments and their numerical tracing\nSediment, water and soil samples were sampled in the\nabove-mentioned river basins and studied by several new tech-\nniques in order to identify trends in the fate and risk potential\nof contaminants. Sorption studies with floodplain soils pointed\nto an increasing sorption capacity with progressing soil for-\nmation (e.g. (Graf et al., 2007). Retention of naphthalene and\nheavy metals was found to be mainly influenced by soil pH\nand soil organic matter (Lair et al., 2007a, b). Trends for metal\nbehavior in soils are presented in Figure 5.\nOther novel live biological monitoring approaches involved\nearthworms and revealed differences between selected flood-\nplain soils in terms of feeding activity and weight loss (Bleeker\nand van Gestel, 2007; Vijver et al., 2007). On the other hand,\nbreakdown of leaves from the Dommel Area (Meuse Basin)\nshowed differences between sampling sites that are probably\nlinked to macro fauna abundance and site properties. Other\nnew bioassay studies with larvae and other sediment habitat in\nthe Elbe System also found decreases of contaminant bioavail-\nability through ageing in sediment-water systems, which may\nbe counteracted by increasing temperatures, thus giving im-\nportant indications for impact assessment under changing cli-\nmate (Hsu et al., 2007).\nIn this context physical models were developed for deter-\nministic trend analysis in groundwater and associated reac-\ntive transport models (Barth et al., 2007b; Visser et al., 2007).\nSeveral tools for trend detection and forecasting for ground-\nwater quality were developed. These included tools based on\nbackscaling of time series using the recharge time, which was\ndetermined by 3H\/3He age dating.\nField campaigns in the Br\u00e9villes Catchment initiated pa-\nrameterisation of pesticide leaching to simulate atrazine and\nwater fluxes in the unsaturated zone and in the aquifer (Morvan\net al., 2006). On the other hand, the Geer Basin in the Meuse\ncomprised a groundwater flow and solute transport model\nfrom input of groundwater sampling for dating techniques in-\ncluding the tritium method to relate the nitrate concentration\nin the aquifer to water ages (Brouy\u00e8re, 2006). This model was\nfurther developed for nitrate transport as an example of highly\nsoluble diffuse inputs (Batlle Aguilar et al., 2007; Brouy\u00e8re\net al., 2007; Orban et al., 2005).\nIn addition to this, a several new theories in the field of ma-\nchine learning (Sch\u00f6lkopf and Smola, 2002; Tipping, 2001)\nand artificial neural networks were investigated and applied to\nrainfall-runoffmodelling in the Gallego Catchment in the Ebro\nBasin (B\u00fcrger et al., 2007). Further interpolation studies on en-\nvironmental screening data was carried out using diverse net-\nwork types and new work was also initiated for pattern recog-\nnition and clustering of a new soil parameter data set across\nEurope.\n3.7. Modeling hydrological and pollutant transport\nand software development\nModeling efforts in AquaTerra addressed relevant flow and\ntransport processes at scales ranging from centimetres to hun-\ndreds of kilometres. At the smallest scale, one-dimensional\nmodels of preferential transport have been developed that ac-\ncount for the mobility of small soil particles and contami-\nnants in macro-pores with initial focus on cadmium transport\n(Dohnal et al., 2006; Dusek et al., 2006). At the local scale\nthe MARTHE 3D code was applied to model preferential\nflow and mass transport in the Br\u00e9villes Catchment (Thiery\nand Amraoui, 2001; Vanderborght et al., 2005). This com-\nplemented a finite differences model with inputs from the\nHYDRO and FLUX subprojects. In addition, the time reso-\nlution of the soil-atmosphere boundary fluxes was found to be\na significant factor when modeling the mobility of dissolved\ncontaminants in soils.\nAt the hillslope scale, a conceptual framework was de-\nveloped and tested for modeling subsurface flow and trans-\nport and in the Meuse-Dommel area were data collection\nand models comparisons were completed. Furthermore, a new\ndatabase for the Meuse-Geer Basin was established includ-\ning data preparation and geometrical set-up of data. Analysis\nof hillslope-scale processes in small, snow dominated, catch-\nments was accomplished by using the GEOtop model (Zanotti\net al., 2004), together with a comprehensive study on soil\nmoisture dynamics and travel time distribution (Botter et al.,\n2007).\nMobility, turnover and storage of pollutants in soils, sediments and waters... 169\nOn larger scales a comprehensive modeling framework for\nsolute transport was developed and applied to the Dese catch-\nment in Italy (Botter et al., 2005, 2006; Rinaldo et al., 2006a,\nb). Based on this theoretical framework the GEOTRANSF\nmodel was developed and applied to the Brenta and Gallego\ncatchments. The first is located in north-eastern Italy, while\nthe second is a tributary of the Ebro River in Spain. This work\nimproves our understanding of anthropogenic effects, such as\nreservoir operation and withdrawals for agricultural purposes,\non the hydrological system and enables to distinguish between\nthe effects of climate change and water use. Developments\nof new modules considering nitrogen cycling and a specific\nsalinisation mechanism were also started (Botter et al., 2006).\nThe Ebro Basin is now planned as a target for an entire basin\nmodel and the salinisation issue will be addressed within the\nGallego catchment in collaboration with INTEGRATOR and\nFLUX teams.\nThe modelling effort was supplemented by the development\nof unified simulation tools for coupled surface\/subsurface flow\nmodels that uses different approaches and constitutes a soft-\nware toolbox for environmental modelling (Beinhorn et al.,\n2005; Kalbacher et al., 2005; Kolditz and Bauer, 2004; Kolditz\net al., 2005, 2006). An application linking soil and ground-\nwater compartments was finalised in the Beerze-Reusel area,\na catchment of about 300 km2 in the Meuse Basin (Kolditz\net al., 2007). This provides a regional hydrologic soil model\nfor groundwater recharge patterns using various infiltration\nscenarios. Such work provides new toolboxes to help link-\ning environmental compartments in modelling through im-\nplemented codes (Geo-Sys\/RockFlow). For the Meuse-Geer\nsubcatchment, a concept for multi-scale modelling was also\nstarted and the team developed a new interface for coupling\nsurface and subsurface flow. With this step, extremely fine res-\nolutions of soils (5 cm vertical) can now be modeled for sev-\neral hundreds of km2 by parallel computation techniques to ad-\ndress highly resolved regional groundwater recharge patterns\nin heterogeneous soils.\n3.8. Integrating socio-economic outcomes and policy\ninteractions\nThe INTEGRATOR team identified key environmental\nissues through stakeholder feedback from the four main\nriver basins studied within AquaTerra (Ebro, Meuse, Elbe,\nDanube). A first economic analysis was performed on selected\ncase studies derived from this work, leading to new initial con-\nceptual models. The new approach proposed to determine how\nbest to address the challenge to assist decision making for a\nrange of end-users at various levels with reference to work\nfrom the INTEGRATOR and EUPOL teams. In a common\nwork effort by the INTEGRATOR team all deliverables pro-\nduced in AquaTerra up to February 2007 were broadly re-\nviewed and assessed with respect to their environmental, so-\ncial and economic characteristics (basin location, scale, key\npressures in the selected areas, type of contaminant, for ex-\nample). In order to enhance the delivery of AquaTerra key\nfindings and achievements and to bring them to potential end-\nusers, a delivery\/integration methodology was developed. This\nconsisted of interviewing subproject- and work package lead-\ners by phone, using simultaneously questionnaires to provide a\nstructure to the interview. This helped to determine which key\nfindings were produced by AquaTerra to date, to understand\nhow these key results could address river basin management\nissues and identify potential end-user types who could benefit\nfrom these results. The process helped to define the Knowl-\nedge & Data and Tools produced by AquaTerra and their ap-\nplicability with respect to relevant issues in river basin man-\nagement.\nA further key objective of the INTEGRATOR project was\nthe identification of the inter-relationships between AquaTerra\nand other scientific projects. Interviews with AT work pack-\nage leaders, along with internet searches and conference\nworkshops, have identified where potential and real collabora-\ntions exists. It is important to note that AquaTerra does not ex-\nist in isolation and that there is an overall awareness of where\nand how interactions take place. While at a European scale\nsuch work is truly the role of a Co-ordination Action, the iden-\ntification of interaction between projects has been a valuable\nexercise and has helped to support the proposals for an inter-\nlinked web-based resource. This is realised through a website\nthat will present the project information in a format of value\nto target end users (technical, management and policy users\nconnected with the implementation of the Water Framework\nDirective to 2015 and beyond). It will also provide a means\nof interconnecting with other project websites in the field of\nwater management with the aim to create a wider resource of\nadded value to end-users, projects and scientists.\nThe EUPOL scientific framework was a first attempt to link\noutputs of AquaTerra to the needs of policy through a series of\ngeneric policy questions identified through brainstorm meet-\nings with policy makers from across Europe. Since this work\nwas produced, the EUPOL team has summarised their ongo-\ning work in a review that deals with the challenges of linking\nscientific knowledge to river basin management policy (Slob\net al., 2007).\n4. CONCLUSION\nThe AquaTerra work shows that the understanding of or-\nganic and inorganic pollutant turnover, storage and transport\nin soils, sediments, ground- and surface water needs interdis-\nciplinary and international approaches that enable the combi-\nnation of techniques and transgression of compartments. The\nmain challenge remains the improvement of understanding of\nthe large-scale behaviour of pollutants with the complexity\nand heterogeneity of the systems involved. Particularly, links\nbetween compartments such as the atmosphere, soils, ground-\nand surface water, as well as sediments, have interfaces where\nthe steepest biogeochemical gradients can be expected. For\ninstance, within basins, floodplains are perhaps the most in-\nteresting sites for dynamic biogeochemical research as they\nlargely control pollutant storage and release. They also link\nthe atmosphere, soils, ground- and surface waters and further\nresearch and exchange of knowledge needs to focus on such\n170 J.A.C. Barth et al.\nexemplatory dynamic areas in order to evaluate how pollutants\nare turned over and under which water level and associated re-\ndox, pH and temperature conditions they may be mobilised or\nimmobilised.\nFor catchment- and basin-wide results the detailed pesticide\nstudy in the Br\u00e9villes area has shown that application of dif-\nfuse pollutants even in small areas leads to highly complex re-\nsponses in ground- and surface water systems. Turnover, stor-\nage and degradation times appear much longer than expected\nand may affect even small systems such as the Br\u00e9villes catch-\nment for decades to centuries. When scaling up to larger ar-\neas, even longer transport times can be anticipated because of\nthe greater distances and generally slower groundwater trans-\nport. It becomes clear that response times of the soil, ground-\nand surface water system can be much longer than measures\ntaken to stop pollutant and nutrient loadings. They often range\nbetween decades and millennia and therefore comprise much\nlonger time spans than policy instruments such as the Water\nFramework or the Groundwater Directives currently take into\naccount. Such instruments must therefore adapt to these time\nframes in order to efficiently implement environmental protec-\ntion.\nOn the other hand, long time frames may also offer ad-\nvantages. For instance, microbiological turnover in the sub-\nsurface may have more time to remove pollutants before they\nare transported to vulnerable receptors such as drinking water\naquifers or organisms in ecosystems. Further research is nec-\nessary to determine which metabolites would be expected un-\nder such a scenario and whether they are harmful and in which\ntime frames they develop and disappear.\nThe MONITOR subproject has demonstrated that we are\nable to determine the status quo of environmental systems with\never increasing accuracy and detail of analytical techniques.\nThis allows better estimation of distributional patterns and the\nevaluation of sources and fluxes of pollutants. On the other\nhand, when process-relevant studies are based in the labora-\ntory alone, they yield crucial first information on the environ-\nmental behaviour of pollutants. Nonetheless, these laboratory\nresults need to either adapt to the field (which remains a major\nchallenge) or demand evaluation with great care when trans-\nferring results to field sites. Some first field-based techniques,\nsuch as stable isotope quantifications of turnover of organic\ncompounds in the field, are beginning to show the extent to\nwhich processes such as natural attenuation actually take place\nin natural environments.\nFor field investigations, our understanding of pollutant dy-\nnamics is often still limited by too sparse sample densities in\nspace and time. While individual sampling campaigns often\nyield highly localised information and snapshots of long-term\nprocesses, new integral monitoring techniques might offer fu-\nture solutions and trends in this respect. With this, our initial\nresults of AquaTerra showed hotspot showed and diffuse pol-\nlution patterns that the evaluation of large-scale and long-term\npollutant behaviour needs to be further resolved with temper-\nature changes and mixtures of pollutants, changing geochem-\nical and microbiological conditions. More field studies under\nreal conditions are necessary to feed results into reactive trans-\nport models. For the above, networks of passive samplers may\nhold the key for taking laboratory results to the field.\nIn terms of potential climate change impacts, not explic-\nitly considered by either the Water Framework or Groundwater\nDirectives, results from the HYDRO sub-project have shown\nthat it is necessary to consider the predictions of more than\none climate model when trying to assess future impacts due\nto the uncertainties in model response. Initial results from im-\npact studies suggest that in Europe we can expect increases\nin heavy rainfall, particularly in winter months, with a poten-\ntial knock-on effect on flooding, and increases in long term\n(southern Europe) and short-term (northern Europe) drought\nfrequencies and intensities. These changes to climate will have\nimportant impacts on the diffusion and degradation of pollu-\ntants in space and time that are just at the start of their explo-\nration. AquaTerra is providing one of the first attempts to link\nclimate change impacts on the soil, sediment, ground- and sur-\nface water system at the catchment scale to management and\npolicy decisions. However, more research is needed in this area\nto provide guidance for management of the effects of climate\nchange on already stressed river basins in Europe.\nOverall, work within AquaTerra leads to recommendations\nthat crop controls and fertilisers need to be applied with care\nand under consideration of the consequences for receiving wa-\nter systems that often serve as drinking water supplies. We\ndeveloped models to quantify export of nutrients by the hy-\nporheic zone and further studies are underway in order to bet-\nter understand the impact of the river network structure on\ncycling of nutrients, and at the smaller scale the interplay be-\ntween riparian and hyporheic areas along the river system.\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the European Union\nFP6 Integrated Project AquaTerra (Project No. GOCE 505428) under the the-\nmatic priority, sustainable development, global change and ecosystems and\nalso further supported by a Grant from the Ministry of Science, Research and\nthe Arts of Baden Wuertemberg (AZ33-7533.18-15-02\/80) to Johannes Barth\nand Peter Grathwohl.\nREFERENCES\nAbelmann K., Kleineidam S., Knicker H., Grathwohl P., Koegel-Knabner\nI.
