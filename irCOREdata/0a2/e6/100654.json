The result, g(2+1 ) = 0.28(5), extends the systematics of g factors of even-even Hf isotopes to\nN = 98 and enables a better test of theoretical models. The g(2+1 ) experimental values of these isotopes exhibit\na remarkable constancy as a function of neutron number. This phenomenon, which was also observed for other\nisotopic chains in the Gd\u2013W range, is explained in terms of a recently proposed empirical model.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.76.047308 PACS number(s): 21.10.Ky, 21.60.Cs, 21.60.Ev\nMeasurements of the g factors of the first 2+ states of even-\neven nuclei in isotopic chains in the A = 150\u2013200 region have\nshown, in some cases, a dependence on the neutron number\nN , which is remarkably weak [1\u20133]. The data for the Yb and\nPt isotopes seem to be even more constant as a function of N\nthan expected from the simple Z\/A prediction [4]. In a recent\nwork [5], these experimental observations were attributed to\na modification of the effective neutron number, caused by a\nsaturation of the proton-neutron interaction around midshell.\nThis simple explanation was used to obtain a consistent\ninterpretation of B(E2) and g(2+1 ) experimental data in heavy\nnuclei and theoretical predictions for g factors and B(E2)s in\nthese nuclei. According to these predictions, almost constant\nvalues of g(2+1 ) are characteristic for nuclei in isotopic chains\nfrom Gd (Z = 64) to W (Z = 74), for the range of neutron\nnumbers from N = 96 to N = 108. Measurements of g factors\nin this region of the periodic table can provide further data to\ntest the proposed interpretation [5] and therefore further our\nunderstanding of the proton-neutron interaction.\nIn this Brief Report we describe the measurement of the\ng factor of the 2+1 state in 170Hf at an excitation energy of\n100.8(2) keV. This experiment is part of a series of g-factor\nmeasurements undertaken at the Wright Nuclear Structure\nLaboratory (WNSL) at Yale University. In this study we use\nion beams produced by the Tandem accelerator of the WNSL\nto induce heavy ion reactions in a relatively thick target. The\nprojectile, its energy, and the target are chosen in such a way\nthat the heavy reaction fragment produced with maximum\ncross section is the parent of the nucleus to be studied. In\nthe present experiment we used a 100 MeV, 16O beam with\na current of about 14 pnA on a 4 mg\/cm2 thick Terbium\ntarget to produce 170Ta via the reaction 159Tb(16O,5n)170Ta.\nA statistical model fusion-evaporation calculation using the\nprogram PACE [6] predicts that 170Ta is produced in this\nreaction with a cross section of about 550 mb; all other\nfragments of the reaction are produced with much smaller\ncross sections, so that by using this particular combination of\nprojectile, target, and projectile energy we obtain an almost\npure 170Ta source. The reaction products are emitted in a\nforward solid angle cone, deposited on an aluminized tape\ncollector, and transported to the center of a superconducting\ncoil capable of producing magnetic fields of up to 6 T. The\ntape was moved cyclically every 15 min. A 3 mm diameter,\n2 mm thick gold plug was placed between the target and the\ntape collector to stop the beam and avoid burning the tape.\nLevels in 170Hf are populated following \u03b2+\/\u03b5 decay of the\nparent 170Ta (T1\/2 = 6.8 min).\nA set of eight coaxial hyperpure germanium detectors\npositioned around the center of the coil was used to measure\nthe perturbed angular correlation of \u03b3 rays emitted following\n\u03b2+\/\u03b5 decay of the reaction products. In Fig. 1 we present\na total projection \u03b3 spectrum. All significant lines are from\nthe decay of 170Ta. A detailed description of the experimental\nsetup is given in Ref. [2]. The half-life of the 2+1 state of 170Hf\nwas recently measured [7] and reported to be 1.21(4) nsec. We\ntherefore used the integral perturbed \u03b3 -\u03b3 angular correlation\nmethod [8]. To determine the g factor we used the 779\u2013\n101 keV, 0+2 \u2192 2+1 \u2192 0+1 cascade. From the coincidence data\nwe calculated the double ratio:\nR(\u03b8, B) =\n[\nI (\u03b8, B)\nI (\u03b8,\u2212B)\n\/\nI (\u2212\u03b8, B)\nI (\u2212\u03b8,\u2212B)\n]1\/2\n. (1)\nI (\u03b8, B) is the coincidence intensity at angle \u03b8 and external\nfield B. The functions I (\u03b8, B) and R(\u03b8, B) can be calculated\nfor any spin sequence and field B using the formulas in Refs.\n[2,8]. The use of the double ratio as defined in Eq. (1) has the\nobvious advantage that normalization for the integral charge\non target at each field direction is not necessary. For a 0+2 \u2192\n2+1 \u2192 0+1 cascade, the maximum double ratio is obtained at\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(4)\/047308(4) 047308-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 047308 (2007)\nFIG. 1.

Therefore, the eight detectors were arranged\nso that 12 of the 28 possible pairs were at these angles. Of\nthe remaining pairs, eight were at 70\u25e6, 110\u25e6; four were at 75\u25e6,\n105\u25e6; and the remaining four were at 180\u25e6. The data acquisition\nsystem was set so that coincidence matrices of all possible\npairs of detectors were recorded. In the data sorting, the events\nfrom detector pairs at the same angle were sorted in the same\ntwo-dimensional \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence matrix. The signs of the\nangles (positive or negative) with respect to the external field\nwere determined using the convention as given by Dorum and\nSelsmark [9]. In addition to the 779\u2013101 keV cascade, we also\ncalculated the double ratio R(\u03b8, B) for three other cascades:\n221\u2013101, 860\u2013101, and 987\u2013101 keV. These results were used\nas a consistency check. Two separate runs were carried out:\none with an external field of 5.85 T and the second one with\na field of 4.40 T. Running time was approximately 100 h for\neach field direction for each run.\nThe results of the double ratio R(\u03b8, B) for all four cascades\nmentioned above for the two experimental runs are given in\nTable I. To obtain the experimental value of the g factor, we\ncalculated the function R(145\u25e6, B) as a function of the g factor\nfor the 0+2 \u2192 2+1 \u2192 0+1 cascade. This was done for the two\nvalues of the magnetic field 4.40 and 5.85 T. The g factor\nis deduced by comparing the experimental values in Table I\nwith the calculated functions. The results are presented in\nFig. 2. Two values of g(2+1 ) were obtained for the two values\nof the magnetic field : 0.28(7) and 0.28(6) for 4.40 and\n5.85 T, respectively. The average of the two values gives the\nfinal result of this experiment:\ng(2+1 )exp = 0.28(5). (2)\nNote that the experimental double ratio R(1450, B) for the\n0+2 \u2192 2+1 \u2192 0+1 cascade is higher for the higher value of the\nmagnetic field, as expected. All the other experimental values\nin columns four and five of Table I were extracted from the data\nas a consistency check. In columns six and seven we present\nthe calculated values of the double ratios, obtained using the\nvalue of the g factor given by Eq. (2). At 180\u25e6, the expected\nvalue of the double ratio for all the cascades is 1.00.\nComparison of columns four, five, six, and seven of Table I\nclearly shows that all the experimental values of the double\nratio are, within the experimental error, in good agreement with\nTABLE I.

This can be considered as experimental\nevidence that systematic errors are smaller than the statistical\nerrors.\nWe now discuss this new experimental value within the\nsystematics of g factors of 2+1 states in the even-even Hf\nisotopes. In Fig. 3 we present the existing data and the result\nof the present work as a function of the neutron number N .\nThe value reported in this work extends the systematics to\nN = 98 and thus enables a better test of theoretical models.\nWe first attempt to interpret the data in terms of two models:\nthe hydrodynamical model [4] and the proton-neutron version\nof the Interacting Boson Model (IBA-2) (see, for example,\nRef. [10] for treatment of g factors in IBA-2). In the F -spin\nFIG. 3. Systematics of g(2+1 ) data for the Hf isotopes. The results\nfor N = 104, 106, and 108 are from the tables of Raghavan [12] and\nStone [13]. The value at N = 98 is from this work. The predictions\nof the rotational and vibrational limits of the hydrodynamical model\n[4], the IBA-2 model [10], and the phenomenological model of\nZhang et al. [5] are also presented.\nsymmetry limit of the IBA-2, the values of g(2+1 ) are given by\nthe simple relation\ng(2+1 ) =\ng\u03c0N\u03c0 + g\u03bdN\u03bd\nN\u03c0 + N\u03bd , (3)\nwhere N\u03c0,N\u03bd are the numbers of proton, neutron bosons and\ng\u03c0 , g\u03bd are the boson g factors. For the latter parameters we\nuse the values g\u03c0 = 0.63 and g\u03bd = 0.05 [11]. Because IBA-2\nis a valence model, only the valence particles contribute to the\nmagnetic moment, and therefore the N -dependence prediction\nfor the g factors is quite strong, as shown in Fig. 3. We also\nnote the change of slope of the IBA-2 calculated values at\nmidshell (N = 104). The vibrational and rotational predictions\nof the hydrodynamical model, presented in Fig. 3, show a weak\nN dependence that is due to the fact that in this model all\nnucleons are assumed to contribute to the magnetic moment.\nAlthough the error bars are relatively large, the data in Fig. 3\nindicate an N dependence even weaker than that predicted by\nthe hydrodynamical model. This behavior of the g(2+1 ) data vs\nN has also been observed for the even-even Yb isotopes [2].\nHowever, while for the Yb isotopes the experimental values\nwere between the rotational and vibrational values, in the\npresent case both these calculations overestimate the data. We\nconclude that both the hydrodynamical and the IBA-2 models\ndo not provide a good description of the data. In a recent work,\nZhang et al. [5] have proposed a simple phenomenological\nmodel to explain the constancy of g factors in deformed\nnuclei. This model assumes that a reduction in the effective\nproton-neutron interaction across the midshell region can be\nsimulated by introducing effective proton and neutron boson\nnumbers. This is the same effect that causes the saturation of\nB(E2) values in the same region. The reduction of the boson\nnumbers is phenomenologically described in Ref. [5] by the\nequation\nN eff\u03c4 = N\u03c4 (1 \u2212 N\u03c4f ) (\u03c4 = \u03c0, \u03bd). (4)\nThe parameter f was found to be f = 0.05 from a fit to\nall existing experimental g-factor data for even-even isotopes\nfrom Gd to W and for the range of neutron numbers from N =\n88 toN = 112. The predictions of the simple phenomenological\nmodel for the Hf isotopes can be calculated by inserting the\neffective boson numbers given above Eq. (4) into Eq. (3). The\nresults of this calculation are also presented in Fig. 3. We see\nthat the data are in good agreement with the phenomenological\nmodel. The new result reported in this Brief Report provides\nfurther experimental support for this model and for the concept\nof effective boson numbers. This phenomenological concept\nwas used in the past [11] to explain anomalies of g-factor and\nB(E2) data in the region of nuclei around A = 150. More\ntheoretical work is needed to provide a microscopical basis\nfor the phenomenological scheme mentioned above, which\nwas found [5] to provide a consistent interpretation for both\ng-factor and B(E2) data. Further experimental data will also\ncontribute to a better understanding of the nuclear structure\nin this region. In particular, from Fig. 3 we see that g-factor\nvalues at N = 94, 96, 100, and 102 are of special interest\n047308-3\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 047308 (2007)\nto substantiate the conclusions of the present work.
