The primary objectives of the study reported here were twofold.

A sample of 221 young, in-service, non-specialist police officers from five UK police forces completed a self-report questionnaire concerning their perceived witness interviewing practices. Respondents were surveyed about their use of the PEACE cognitive interview components, their practical experiences of interviewing witnesses and victims, and their views on investigative interviewing training.
