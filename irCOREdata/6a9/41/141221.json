Spinach chloroplasts, thylakoids and Photosystem II\nproteins were employed as biotools in combination with colorimetric assays based\non dichlorophenol indophenole (DCIP) photoreduction and on fluorescence emission\ntechniques.

Such interest could be explained by \na fascination with this complex process and also by the possibility of applying the inner \nphotosynthetic mechanisms in the most diversified fields. This last topic is really interesting, and \nexamples of applications of photosynthetic materials can be found in the environmental or in the \nenergy transfer fields [1-5].  \nPhotosynthetic materials, such as the chloroplasts, thylakoid membranes, Photosystem II (PSII) \nfrom higher plants and the bacterial reaction centers (RC) could provide a great opportunity to built \nphoto-optical electronic devices based on chloroplast proteins. Such applications of the \nphotosynthetic materials are studied by a sub-branch of molecular electronics, called \u201cRC-\nbiotechnology\u201d. The main idea of such application is that the photosynthetic proteins behave \nexactly like molecular machines in which a light signal (which constitutes also the energy to be \nemployed) is used to start a reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction [6, 7, 8].  \nPhotosynthetic materials, and in particular RC proteins specifically interact with some pollutants \nsuch as pesticides, herbicides and heavy metals and therefore can be used for their detection. These \npollutants are present in the industrial waste effluents and agricultural run-off and pose a risk of \ncontamination of agricultural soils, surface and ground waters and a consequent accumulation in \nplant and animal tissues. Environmental monitoring is of fundamental importance for preservation \nof the planet and of its natural resources, and this is why the techniques and the procedures for \ndetecting ecosystem pollutants are always in demand [1].   \nAn interesting way for exploiting photosynthetic samples in the environmental field consists in \nperforming bioassays in solutions: the observation of changes in the chemical-physical properties of \nthe materials under test, in the presence of pollutant substances, can give useful information about \nmechanisms of interaction between photosynthetic systems and toxic compounds.  \nFor example, one of the most interesting and simple assays for the evaluation of in vitro \nphotosynthetic material activity (considered as electronic transfer) is the Hill Reaction [9-11], as \nreported in the \u201cmaterials and methods\u201d section.  \nHeavy metals such as copper, cadmium, mercury, lead are toxic even at low concentrations, they \nare not biodegradable, and have the tendency to accumulate in the living organisms [2]. It is known \nthat heavy metals could seriously affect the photosynthetic apparatus by irreversibly binding the \ncomponents of photosynthetic electron transport chain. At the same time it is also true that at very \nlow concentrations many heavy metals are important for photosynthetic organisms. For example, \ncopper (Cu) is a prosthetic group present in the protein plastocyanin and it is fundamental for \nphotosynthesis: if Cu concentration in the nutrient medium is less than 10-14-10-16 M (ranging from \norganism to organism) Cu deficiency can occur, and plants grown in such conditions were found \nwith changes in the expression of several genes, with reductions in PSI and PSII activities and with \nmorphological changes in the leaf or in the root structures [12, 13]. However, high Cu concentration \n(similar to other heavy metals) can strongly and negatively affect the photosynthetic electron chain, \nin particular at PSII level. It has been reported that PSII (rather than PSI) is the main target for Cu \n[14], although the binding site is still a matter of debate. Some researchers are sure that the site \nshould be on the donor side, probably close to the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) through its \nbinding to the residue of thyrosine in PSII [15-17], but some different scientific suggestions do exist \n[4]. It is also widely reported that in the PSII-LHCII complexes (where LHCII represents the Light \nHarvesting Complex II) Cu interacts with chlorophylls (chls) by substituting the central Mg(II) \natom. In particular, chls embedded inside the LHCII are considered as the main target pigments for \nCu ions in the dark conditions [18-22]. Other heavy metal-substituted chls (hms-chls) have been \nobserved and reported in the literature [18-22], as in the cases of Zn-chl or Ni-chl, and every hms-\nchl showed reduced fluorescence emission quantum yield and modified excited state levels [23, 24]; \nmoreover, the formation of hms-chls is usually considered to play a key role in the photosynthesis \ninhibition by heavy metals [18, 22, 25-33].  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 3 \nAlthough a great level of information can be found in the literature, about the effects of heavy metal \nenriched media on different photosynthetic organism growth , less abundant data have dealt with \nthe effects of almost instant heavy metal additions to these bio-material. \nIn this work, investigations on the influences of heavy metals at different concentrations on \nphotosynthetic materials isolated from spinach leaves were performed using optical methods. In \nparticular, in the first part of the present work the effects of Cu(II), Hg(II), Co(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II) \nions on the PSII complex, membrane fraction enriched in PSII (BBYs), thylakoid and chloroplast \nactivities were analyzed by means of Hill Reaction based assays, showing the rapid inhibition in the \nelectron transfer efficiencies especially in the presence of Cu(II) and Hg(II) for each biological \nsample. In the second part of the work, fluorescence emission measurements were carried out to \nconsider influences of the same metal ions on the pigments present in the photosynthetic materials. \nRapid and remarkable responses were obtained by each bio-material used only in the presence of \ncopper, this showing a specificity of the emission test for this heavy metal.  \n \n \n \n \n \nExperimental \n \nChemicals \n \nTriton X-100, n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DM), n-octyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (OG), [2-N-\nmorpholine]ethane-sulphonic acid (MES), NaCl, CaCl2, CuCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2 and NaHCO3 were \npurchased from Sigma; HgCl2 and MnCl2 were purchased from Fluka; acetone (99.8%) and \nsulphuric acid (96%) were purchased from C. Erba.  \n \nIsolation of chloroplasts, thylakoids, membrane fractions enriched in PSII, PSII core complexes \n \nChloroplasts, thylakoids, membrane fractions enriched in PSII (BBYs) and PSII complexes were \nisolated from market spinach leaves according to Hankamer's procedure [34\u201337]. Chloroplasts were \nobtained from spinach leaves using differential centrifugation and thylakoids from chloroplasts by \ntheir rupture in a hypotonic solution. Thylakoids were solubilized with Triton X-100 in order to \nextract PSII enriched membranes. These last membranes were solubilized with OG to detach the \nLHCII proteins from the PSII core (OG-core complexes). OG-core complexes were then diluted \nwith an aqueous buffer (MNCB) containing MES (25 mM), NaCl (10 mM), CaCl2 (5 mM) and \nNaHCO3 (10 mM), and DM was added to the solution, in order to obtain a chl concentration of 0.5 \nmg\/ml and a 25 mM DM concentration. \nSucrose gradients, supplemented with DM (0.03 %, w\/v), were used to obtain oxygen-evolving PSII \ncore monomers which lack the 23- and 17-kDa extrinsic proteins and the CP29, CP26, CP24 chl \nbinding proteins. The concentration of PSII complex samples was quantified accordingly to chl \nconcentration, in mg mL-1 [38]. \nThe photosynthetic materials (chloroplasts, thylakoids, membrane fractions enriched in PSII, PSII \ncore complexes) were stored at -80\u00b0C after freezing in liquid nitrogen: these storage conditions \nprevents the biosamples from ageing effects [7, 39]. \n \n \nPhotochemical assays \n \nThe oxido-reductive reaction known as the \u201cHill reaction\u201d was originally observed on chloroplasts \nby using a suitable electron acceptor \u201cA\u201d, as reported in the following:  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 4 \nh\u03bd \nchloroplasts \n \n                                                     H2O + A                    AH2 + 1\/2O2 \n \nAs electron acceptors, several compounds can be used, as in the case of 2,6-dichlorophenol \nindophenol (DCIP), that is capable to capture the electrons flowing from PSII to PSI during the Z-\nscheme performed under illumination inside chloroplasts, changing from blue to colourless [11].  \nIn order to observe the photosynthetic activity of photosynthetic materials under the influence of \nadded heavy metals, the Hill reaction was extended to all the bio-samples here studied; the electron \ntransfer was correlated with DCIP photoreduction by an electron donor (water for BBYs, thylakoids \nand chloroplasts) catalyzed by the biomaterials under study. Absorbance measurements were \ncarried out at 600 nm, and an extinction coefficient of 21 mM\u22121 cm\u22121 was used to calculate the \nconcentration of reduced DCIP. A set of four 13 W fluorescent tubes (Osram, Munich, Germany), \neach one producing basic cool white light (830 lm), were used to induce the DCIP reduction. In \norder to compare the different bio-assays in their specific optimal conditions, the time of \nillumination was optimized and selected individually for each different photosynthetic material \nemployed, as reported in the result section; chl concentration in each tested preparation was 0.005 \nmg mL-1 and DCIP was about 60 \u00b5M; the media used for each assay was SMNCB (pH 6.5), \ncomposed by 25 mM Mes, 0.3 M Sucrose, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3. The heavy \nmetal ions tested in this work were Cu(II), Hg(II), Co(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II). Visible absorption \nspectra were recorded using a Varian CARY\/5 spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, \nUSA) using 1 cm path length quartz cells. \n \n \nSteady-state fluorescence experiments \n \nInteractions between photosynthetic materials, particularly pigments, and heavy metals were studied \nby fluorescence emission tests. The experiments were performed by exciting the photosynthetic \nmaterial suspensions (PSII, BBY and thylakoid membranes) in the absence or in the presence of \nmetals at excitation wavelength 436 nm, and by observing emission in the range 600-800 nm. Every \nemission experiment was performed on bio-samples, diluted at final chl concentration of 0.015 mg \nmL-1 in SMNCB buffer. The heavy metal ions tested in this work were Cu(II), Hg(II), Co(II), \nMn(II) and Ni(II). Fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Varian Cary Eclipse \nspectrofluorimeter (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).  \n \n \nStatistical analysis \n \nGraphPad InStat software (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used to process the data by analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA) to indicate statistically extremely significant differences between means (one-\nway ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test, p<0.0001). All reported data represent mean values \u00b1 \nstandard deviations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 5 \nResults and discussion \n \nHill Reaction assays \n \nIn the present study chloroplasts, BBYs, thylakoid membranes and PSII complexes were extracted \nfrom spinach leaves according to the section \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d. Such variety of \nphotosynthetic materials with different organization levels was used in order to compare the \ndifferences in the responses of these biosystems, to the presence of heavy metals, by using optical \nbio-assays. \nThe effects of copper, mercury, cobalt, nickel and manganese ions were analyzed by means of the \nHill Reaction-like optical assay, since the photosynthetic activity can be determined as proportional \nto the absorbance decrement at 600 nm of the DCIP signal. This parameter is strongly connected to \nthe electron transfer efficiency in the tested photosynthetic materials giving useful information on \nthe interactions between heavy metals and samples. \nSince this method requires that the sample is capable to catalyze the reduction of DCIP and the \noxidation of water by exploiting white light illumination as energy, it is necessary that the starting \nphotosynthetic material is highly efficient in the electronic transfer. This prerequisite is easily \nsatisfied by BBYs, thylakoid membranes and chloroplasts which contain all the complexes involved \nin the electron transfer, but not sufficiently by PSII complexes which are extracted from their \nnatural membranes and can not efficiently conduct the above-mentioned redox reaction. For this \nreason for PSII complexes some modification of the Hill Reaction would be required. It includes the \naddition of the 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) which is employed as a more appropriate electron \ndonor. Nevertheless, in this work the interactions between PSII complexes and heavy metals were \nnot investigated by this specific assay, since tested heavy metals were reacting with DPC, thus \ninfluencing the measurements (data not shown). As a result the Hill-like assays were performed \nwith chloroplasts, thylakoid and BBY membranes. \nThe bio-samples were previously characterized by absorbance measurements and preliminary Hill \nReaction-based tests were performed with the purpose to evaluate the optimal conditions for the \nsubsequent analyses.  \nThe absorbance spectra of the assay solution containing photosynthetic material and DCIP, were \nthen recorded at different times under constant white light illumination. The spectra resulted from \nthe overlapping of the DCIP absorption band visible in the range 550-650 nm and the typical \nthylakoid spectrum (Fig. 1A), having the main peaks at about 675 and 436 nm due to chlorophyll a \nand shoulders in the range 450\u2013550 nm attributable to carotenoids [40\u201343].  \nAlthough a slight photobleaching effect is produced by light stress on the inner pigments, \nobservable as decrements in the chlorophyll 675 and 436 nm peaks, this does not influence the \nrange 550-650 nm, where DCIP absorbs light radiation; therefore, for these systems, in the range \n550-650 nm, the most important light effect is the DCIP reduction by the photosynthetic samples, \nvisible as decrement of its absorption band intensity. \nAs it can be seen on the Fig. 1B, the photoreduction of DCIP by all studied bio-samples reached its \nplateau within 5-6 minutes. It is clear that the chloroplast preparations were more efficient than \nthylakoids and BBY membranes, as demonstrated by the higher value of the photoreduction of \nDCIP. Nevertheless, all the tested photosynthetic materials were able to reduce DCIP and reach \nhigh plateau values. \nAfter the optimization, optical assays, based on the Hill Reaction, were performed in order to verify \nthe influences of the tested heavy metals on photo-induced electron transfer in the photosynthetic \nmaterials.  \nThe results obtained for chloroplast solutions are reported in Fig. 2A: as it is shown, the electron \ntransfer of chloroplasts was influenced in different ways by different metals at a fixed concentration \nof 10-4 M; the effects of heavy metals under test were calculated according to the subsequent \nformula and then plotted as bars: \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 6 \nElectron transfer inhibition % = 100 \u2013 (\u2206AbsM\/\u2206Abs0)\u00b7100 \nwhere \u2206AbsM represents the absorbance change after the Hill-like reaction (within a specified \nillumination time) for a photosynthetic material in the presence of one of the metals at the specified \nconcentration; \u2206Abs0 represents the absorbance change after the Hill-like reaction for the \nphotosynthetic material in the absence of metals. \nThe graph shows that when a metal has strong negative effect on chloroplasts, an inefficient DCIP \nphotoreduction is performed, a remarkable metal effect has occurred and a high electron transfer \ninhibition bar can be observed. The Hill-reaction reached its maximum in 5-6 minutes for \nchloroplasts, and that is why it was decided to perform the analyses in 5 minutes under constant \nillumination, in order to test the effects of copper, mercury, manganese, cobalt and nickel ions. In \nthe chloroplast preparations, the effects produced by 10-4 M bivalent manganese, cobalt and nickel \nions on the DCIP reduction (i.e. on the electron transfer efficiency) were not found to be important. \nAt contrary, Cu(II) and Hg(II) resulted to strongly affect the chloroplast electronic transfer, in a way \nwhich remarkably depended on the heavy metal concentrations, as reported in the next paragraphs.  \nIn order to evaluate any difference between tested photosynthetic samples, the same experiments \nreported in Fig. 2A were carried out for BBY and thylakoid membranes, and similar results were \nobtained from a qualitative point of view. Very slight influences were observed by adding 10-4 M of \nCo(II), Mn(II) or Ni(II) on the electron transfer efficiency, while 10-4 M of Cu(II) and Hg(II) \nshowed remarkable effects.  \nIn the Fig. 2B, the percentage effects of only copper and mercury ions on all the bio-samples used \nwere showed. It can be observed that in each case, Cu(II) showed the strongest effects on DCIP \nphotoreduction, with similar results for every bio-sample employed. Slightly less remarkable \ninfluences were recorded for mercury, and some differences were observed by changing the \nphotosynthetic material. In particular BBY were found to be more stable with respect to Hg(II) \naddition than thylakoid and chloroplast preparations. \nThe dependences of the DCIP photoreduction efficiency on the copper and mercury ion \nconcentrations were analyzed for all the bio-samples and the results are visible in the Fig. 3A and B, \nrespectively.  \nAs it is shown in the Fig. 3A, although the three different bio-samples could respond to copper even \nat 10-7 M concentrations, chloroplasts and thylakoids were found to be more resistant to Cu(II) than \nBBYs. It was, in fact, observed that in order to inactivate completely the chloroplasts and \nthylakoids, higher metal concentrations (10-5 M) were required, in comparison with BBYs which \nwould be inactivated with 10-6 M of Cu(II).  \nCu(II) is known to interact preferentially at the level of the LHCII chls in dark conditions, while \nunder strong illumination it seems to directly damage PSII at level of the pheophytin or of the chl \ninside the reaction center [22]. Moreover, under strong illumination Cu(II) effects are enforced, \nprobably due to rapid formation of OH radicals via a Cu(II)-catalyzed mechanism [44]. Obviously, \nthese mechanisms of damaging produce secondary inhibiting effects on the electron transport chain \nof the photosynthetic systems. All these reasons could explain the greater sensitivity and more rapid \nresponses of the tested photosynthetic systems to Cu(II) [22], as well as the easier inactivation of \nBBYs, that are thylakoid membranes enriched in LHCII-PSII complexes. \nIn the Fig. 3B the effects of Hg(II) concentration are reported: it is evident that Hg(II) concentration \ncan influence the electron transfer in all performed bio-assays, even if all the bio-samples were \nfound to be more resistant to Hg(II) than to Cu(II): in fact, Hg(II) ions inhibited the bio-sample \nactivities at higher concentrations than Cu(II). \nThe mechanism of photosynthesis inhibition by Hg is less documented in the scientific literature \n[22]: it is indicated that Hg ions inhibit the electron flow in different photosynthetic organisms at \nmultiple sites [45]: at the oxidizing side of PSII [46, 47], at the RC of PSI [48] or at level of the \nplastocyanin [46, 49]. The differences between Hg and Cu inactivation mechanisms could justify \nthe greater resistance of the photosynthetic materials to Hg(II). \n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 7 \nEmission measurements  \n \n In Fig. 4A steady-state emission spectra of PSII complexes are reported, as recorded during a \nperiod of time of 20 minutes at room temperature, after excitation at 436 nm: the emission spectra \npresent a typical band at 683 nm and a shoulder at 740 nm, which is probably due to a vibrational \nsublevel, as reported in the relevant literature [38, 50\u201352]. Fluorescence red re-absorption can be \nconsidered negligible because of the low PSII concentrations used (chl content was 0.015 mg\/ml) \n[53]. As it can be easily observed, the PSII emission intensity undergoes a rapid decrease: this \nbehaviour has to be ascribed to a partial aggregation involving the photosynthetic proteins in the \nbuffer used, as previously reported [54]. Actually, in aqueous buffers even if stabilizing detergents \nare employed, PSII complexes (i.e. membrane proteins) can be involved in aggregative processes, \nthat cause the quenching of the emission signal of their chls as long as the proteins aggregate; the \nemission intensity results to decrease during time, until a stationary intensity value is reached.  \nIn Fig. 4B, the fluorescence emission intensity at peak value (\u03bb = 683 nm) is measured as a function \nof time for PSII complexes, BBY, thylakoid membranes and chloroplasts at room temperature. The \nvalues are reported as percentage ratios between the absolute intensity sampled at a certain time and \nthe corresponding initial intensity value. In this way the points in the graph indicate the residual \nemission percentages for the tested samples. Each reported emission measurement was carried \nusing samples with chl concentration equal to 0.015 mg mL-1. It was observed that PSII complexes \nunderwent an evident emission quenching, while in average BBY and thylakoid membrane \nemissions were found to be more stable than PSII with time; also chloroplasts produced rather \nstable emission signals during 20 minutes of observation. All the above mentioned bio-samples \nwere chosen for the subsequent investigations on the effects of heavy metals on photosynthetic \nmaterial emission.  \nIn the Fig. 5A the percentages of BBY emission loss after 10 minutes of incubation with 10-4 M \nheavy metals (copper, mercury, manganese, cobalt and nickel). These values were obtained \naccording to the following equation: \nEmission loss % = 100 \u2013 (\u0399M\/\u03990)\u00b7100 \nwhere \u0399M represents the emission intensity after 10 minutes of incubation for a photosynthetic \nmaterial in the presence of one of the metals at the specified concentration; I0 represents the \nemission intensity for the photosynthetic material before metal addition. The values reported in the \ngraphs were also corrected by subtracting a blank value, that is the value observed for the same \nphotosynthetic material in the absence of metals after 10 minutes of incubation; this correction was \nmandatory, since biomaterials showed loss of fluorescence with time (Fig.4), and it was necessary \nto exclude that this phenomenon could overlap with effects of added heavy metal cations.  \nFirst of all, it is evident that the intensity of BBY emission is reduced in the presence of heavy \nmetals, but most of all in the presence of copper ions. From a qualitative point of view, similar \nresults were obtained for other photosynthetic materials: copper dramatically decreased the \nemission intensities also in PSII complex, thylakoid and chloroplast preparations.  \nIn general, it can be asserted that the presence of each tested heavy metal in PSII, chloroplast and \nthylakoid solutions slightly affected the emission intensity, but in the case of copper, interesting \neffects have to be highlighted. The strong and rapid interaction between Cu(II) and photosynthetic \nsamples is confirmed in Fig. 5B where the percentages of emission loss for all tested photosynthetic \nmaterials in the presence of copper ions are indicated: BBY emission loss was found as \nconsiderably greater than the other bio-samples after incubation with this metal; even for BBY no \nimportant effect was recorded in the presence of the other tested heavy metals. \nThe remarkable effects produced by Cu(II) on emission intensities of photosynthetic samples are in \naccordance with the data and observations here reported in the Hill assay section. In fact the \nformation of Cu substituted chls  is responsible primarily for the loss of emission intensity [19] and \nit can strongly reduce the light harvesting efficiencies of antenna [18, 19]. In the past, most of the \nstudies were carried out by means of in vivo tests, evaluating the growth of photosynthetic \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 8 \norganisms in the presence of heavy metals: not only Cu-substituted, but also other heavy metal-\nsubstituted chls were observed in a great number of scientific works [21-24]. In our work effects \nproduced by short- time incubation of different photosynthetic samples isolated from spinach with \nsalts of heavy metals, added information to this stimulating debate. According to the literature, all \nthe hms-chls should show a very important loss in the emission intensities if compared with the \nnatural Mg-chl. In this work, the considerable emission decrements, that are visible only for Cu \nadditions, should be ascribed to the short incubation time (20 minutes): therefore, the data seem to \nindicate that interaction between Cu(II) and chls occurs in a very short time, i.e. mainly in the first \n10-15 minutes (data showing the effect of heavy metals during time were also obtained, but not \nshown); at the same time the effects observed with Hg, Ni, Mn and Co ions are less pronounced, \nindicating less rapid interactions with the photosynthetic materials.  \nThe responses of the photosynthetic sample emission intensities to different concentrations of \nCu(II) ions, after a fixed incubation time of 10 minutes are reported in Fig. 6, where emission \nintensity percentages were calculated as indicated for Fig. 4B. \nAs already found during the Hill assays, copper concentration affects all the photosynthetic \nmaterials under test, even if the greatest influence was observed on BBY membranes, which \nresulted to be strongly and sensitively dependant on the metal concentration, due to the fact that \nthese particular biological preparations are enriched in PSII-LHCII super-complexes. \nIn fact, it is necessary to highlight that the concentration of chl was the same for each tested bio-\npreparation. Therefore, in chloroplasts and thylakoids chls are not only located inside LHCII or PSII \nproteins, but also inside PSI and LHCI proteins, which exploit this class of pigments for capture and \nconversion of the light energy; due to this, PSII-LHCII enriched membranes (i.e. BBYs) are more \nenriched in \u201cuseful chls\u201d than thylakoids or chloroplasts (and than PSII complexes, which are \nisolated without their LHCII system). Another important explanation for the differences showed by \nBBY and PSII proteins could reside in the fact that during the experiments aggregation processes \noccur, that are more important for PSII proteins than for the other bio-samples; therefore, the \naccessibility of PSII chls could be significantly decreased. All these reasons could explain the \ngreater sensitivity to the metal concentration for BBYs than for the other bio-samples tested.  \nIn order to analyze the possibility of a practical application for the reported optical method, it would \nbe necessary to discuss the concentration limits that have to be observed according to the relevant \nlaws. In Europe limits of the heavy metal concentrations are determined by the individual European \nstates. For example, in Italy, allowed concentration of Cu(II) in surface water is < 0.1 mg L-1, while \nin public sewerage waste is < 0.4 mg L-1 (which corresponds < 1.57\u00d710-6 M and < 6.30\u00d710-6 M, and \non the logarithmic scale -5.8 and -5.2, respectively). As it is shown in the Fig. 6, the limits for \nCu(II) are comprised in a concentration range, where the BBY emission loss changes sensitively; \nfor this reason, the emission assay could provide a potential tool for the monitoring of copper ions \nin water on the scale required by legislation. At the same time PSII proteins and the other tested \nbio-samples did not demonstrate the sensitivity towards the copper which would be sufficient for \ntheir practical applications. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 9 \nConclusions \n \nThe data presented here refers to the effects of heavy metals (Cu(II), Hg(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II)) \ndirectly added to isolated photosynthetic materials, differently from most of literature data, that \nregard the growth of photosynthetic organisms in heavy metal enriched media. Results showed that \nassays exploiting fluorescence emission and absorbance techniques can give very useful \ninformation about short-time toxic interactions occurring between copper or mercury ions and \nphotosynthetic materials extracted from spinach leaves. In particular, the emission measurements \nshowed a specificity for copper, with higher sensitivity when BBY membranes were employed as a \nbiotool; other bio-materials, i.e. PSII, thylakoids and chloroplasts showed less sensitive responses. \nAt the same time, the Hill Reaction-based methods were found to be more sensitive to Cu(II) than \nto other metals, even if interesting responses were also observed with respect to Hg(II). Since \nconcentration of 10-7 M Cu(II) could be measured, that is lower than the European concentration \nlimits for Cu(II) in water, the data concerning copper ion effects using both optical assays could be \nconsidered as a basis for developing practical and rapid copper-specific analytical tools, with \nreduced costs if compared to the official standard methods for metal determination, like Graphite \nFurnace Atomic Absorption or Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. The \nco-operation of the two optical assays could also give interesting analytical information, since while \npositive responses obtained by the Hill method indicate the presence of copper and\/or mercury, the \nemission test will be capable to give information exclusively about copper ions. Moreover, although \nthe Hill Reaction method has been more widely proposed for the detection purposes, it offers only \nthe possibility of assays in solution, whilst the emission measurements here presented, constitute a \nbackground study for possible application of the BBY membranes in the biosensor field.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 10 \nReferences \n \n[1]  M.T.
