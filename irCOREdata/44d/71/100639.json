INTRODUCTION\nThis article continues a series of papers which investi-\ngates the three-body continuum and transition properties of\nBorromean halo nuclei, with particular reference to 6He as a\ncase study. The earliest articles [1] examined simple transition\nresponses, summed over all final states. More recently we\nhave studied general features of the spatial two-dimensional\ndensities [2] and intrinsic energy correlations in 3 \u2192 3\nscattering [3], again exemplified by the continuum of 6He.\nThree-body core+n + n dynamics and the Schro\u00a8dinger three-\nbody equation, solved within the method of hyperspherical\nharmonics (HH) (see Refs. [1\u20135]), were used consistently for\nboth bound and continuum states. For 6He a \u2018realistic\u2019 \u03b1n\ninteraction [1,4] with purely repulsive s-wave component and\nthe GPT nn interaction [6] were used.\nThe three-body model has been successfully tested in\ncalculations of bound and lowest excited states of the A = 6\nnuclei [1,4], for the calculation of inelastic 6He(n, n\u2032) and\ncharge-exchange 6Li(n, p) reactions to the 6He continuum\n[7,8], and for the inelastic 11Li(p, p\u2032) reaction [9]. The\ncontinuum and ground state (g.s.) wave functions were more\nrecently also used for studying elastic and inelastic breakup\nof 6He on 12C and Pb targets [10] under the kinematically\ncomplete conditions of GSI experiments [11]. Very recently\n[12], angular and energy correlations for 6He have been\nmeasured and compared with the predictions of our model.\nWith one-step break-up reaction theories such as DWBA,\napplicable in the high energy regime, or the semiclassical\n*Permanent address: Russian Research Center \u201cThe Kurchatov\nInstitute,\u201d RU-123182 Moscow, Russia.\n\u2020Permanent address: Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, RU-\n141980 Dubna, Russia.\nmethod for electromagnetic dissociation, involving transitions\nfrom the g.s. to the three-body continuum, we have found the\ntransition densities to be the decisive ingredient for the energy\ndependence of the break-up cross section. The particular\nreaction mechanism scales the transition amplitudes and\nslightly distorts the shape of the cross section. The transition\ndensities are also influenced by intertwined correlations where\nboth the g.s. and the three-body continuum contribute.\nFor three-body nuclear Borromean systems we can never\ndirectly observe the intrinsic structure of the continuum since\nthe 3 \u2192 3 nuclear scattering seems impossible to perform\nexperimentally. In the molecular case this was, however,\nrecently performed for caesium atoms in a trap [13]. Thus\nwe have to deal with the responses (in the simplest case\nan integrated and squared transition density), generated by\ntransition operators from the g.s., in which case the g.s.\nacts as a filter. Also, in contrast to transitions from compact\nbound states, the range of impact parameters acceptable\nin 3 \u2192 3 scattering is limited by a maximal hypermoment\nK <\n\u221a\n2mE\/h\u00af2\u3008\u03c1\u3009 where E is the continuum energy, m the\nnucleon mass and \u3008\u03c12\u3009 = (Ac+2)R2Ac+2 \u2212 AcR2Ac . The \u3008\u03c12\u30091\/2\nis the rms hyperradius of the bound state expressed via rms\nradii of the core (RAc ) and of the halo nucleus (RAc+2) [14], and\nis also the three-body impact parameter in the 3 \u2192 3 scattering\ncase [3].\nThe difference between the intrinsic structure of the con-\ntinuum and responses is most dramatically seen if the binary\ninteractions are set to zero for the continuum wave functions:\nthis is the no-final-state-interaction (NoFSI) case often used\nfor estimates. The continuum structure would then consist of\nplane waves antisymmetrized between the halo nucleons, with\nzero phase shifts, and there would never be any identifiable\ndiscrete continuum \u2018states\u2019 apart from the nonresonant and\nno-interacting continuum. Even in this case, there might be\nrelatively narrow peaks in the continuum response from the\ng.s., especially if long-range transition operators such as r or\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(6)\/064612(14) 064612-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nB. V. DANILIN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 064612 (2007)\nr2 are used. But it is clear that although such peaks reflect a time\ndelay of excitation processes, they should never be identified\nas intrinsic continuum \u2018states\u2019 with widths and lifetimes. The\ncorrelations (or momentum distributions) in the g.s. can also\nresemble the narrow momentum distributions of fragments\nmeasured in break-up reactions (and they can even be peaked\nat low excitation energies), which in reality can be caused by\nlow-lying resonances in the three-body continuum [8,15].\nIn the current article, we analyze the transition energy\ncorrelations for the lowest J\u03c0 in the Borromean continuum\nwhen written as functions of the energies in the different\nsets of Jacobi coordinates. Only nuclear type transitions are\nincluded in this article. We give an analysis of the one- and two-\ndimensional transition energy correlations in the three-body\nproblem, pointing out the simplest analytical properties, which\ncan be revealed in kinematically complete experiments. This\ngives possibilities for discriminating between experimental\nand\/or theoretical ambiguities. In future work we will also\ndiscuss the angular\/energy correlations in the 6He continuum.\nIn all cases we use realistic potentials for the 6He case,\nand the Feshbach method [16] for reducing a basis from up\nto hyperangular momentum K\u000140(41) for three interacting\nbodies, to an active space of K\u000110(11) for even and odd\nparities respectively. The 0+ state in 11Li within the spinless\ncore+n + n approach, and the dipole nuclear response have\nbeen obtained in our P2 model [9,17].\nII. ENERGY CORRELATIONS IN TRANSITIONS TO\nTHREE-BODY CONTINUUM\nThe three-body problem contains two extreme spatial scales\nfor the three interacting bodies. The first (a) is a short-range\nscale, with size about the sum of the radii of the binary\ninteractions, and which produces a compact spatial structure\nsuch as a true three-body resonance. The most remarkable\nfeature of a \u2018true\u2019 three-body resonance is that it exists in the\nconfigurations with the lowest hyperangular momenta, which\ncorresponds to the three particles interacting while close to\neach other.\nA second spatial scale (b) arises from the phenomenon of a\nlong-range effective three-body interaction with a range about\nthe sum of the scattering lengths in the binary subsystems.\nThis is responsible for the Efimov effect [18] and for a spectral\ncompression near the three-body threshold. In general (b)\nreflects the possibility of some two interacting particles to\n\u2018feel\u2019 the presence of the third one at a distance up to the\nscattering length. When we deal with a Borromean halo, the\nneutron\u2013neutron interaction with scattering length \u223c16 fm is\ndecisive for this effect (\u2018continuum pairing\u2019). Additionally, in\nthe 11Li case [19] the presence of an intruder virtual s-state in\n10Li gives a large (but still not experimentally fully determined)\nscattering length, which contributes essentially to its unusually\nlarge matter radius.\nAnother possibility is that a large correlation distance could\narise from a long-living binary resonance propagating to a large\ndistance. In this case there is no concentration of wave function\ninside the region of interaction of all particles, but a long range\nspreading of correlations.\nOne can expect four main physical sources for amplification\nof transitions, partly in correspondence with the possible\namplification of cross sections for 3 \u2192 3 scattering [3]:\n(i) True three-body resonances, which are due to interac-\ntion of all three particles in the interior domain;\n(ii) A long lived binary resonance in one of the constituent\npairs;\n(iii) The response of an extended system to long-range\ntransition operators used to excite the continuum;\n(iv) Resonances due to strong coupling between channels\n(CC resonance in a few channels) or a parametric\nresonance in quantum diffusion with complex coeffi-\ncients [20,21].\nResonance criteria are as in the two-body case: (A) a\nconcentration of the wave function in the interior region\n(except for barrier top and virtual-state cases), and that (B) the\nexistence and properties of any intrinsic resonant state should\nnot depend on the excitation mechanism (electromagnetic,\nstrong or weak interaction, etc.) that produces it.\nTo study the three-body problem, translationally-invariant\ncoordinates are used. After separation of the center of mass\nmotion, the intrinsic excitation properties can be displayed in\ntwo \u2018binary\u2019 Jacobi subsystems (any pair of particles and the\nrelative motion of this pair relative to the third constituent).\nA way to gain an insight into these degrees of freedom is to\nanalyze their correlation properties.\nIn the Appendices of Refs. [2] and [3] we summarized the\nJacobi spatial x, y and relative momentum kx,ky coordinates\nnecessary to describe the bound and scattering states of\nthree-body systems consisting of a spinless core and two\nhalo nucleons. We henceforth use the same notations for our\nthree-body wave functions and all variables.\nA. De\ufb01ning energy correlations\nWe start from the simplest (but very important) charac-\nteristics such the angular-averaged energy correlations. From\nthe theoretical point of view, it is convenient to use Jacobi\ncoordinates to describe internal excitations of the system, i.e.,\na coordinate for the relative motion between two particles (dis-\ntance xi , conjugate momentum kxi , energy \u0004xi = h\u00af2k2xi\/2m)\nand another between the c.m. of these particles and the\nthird one (yi ,kyi , \u0004yi ). In both cases the Jacobi coordinates\nare related to the physical distances by an appropriate mass\nscaling. Of the three Jacobian systems {i} we will only use\ntwo because of the identity of the two halo neutrons. In\none Jacobi system (T) we use the neutron-neutron relative\nmotion energy Enn = \u0004xi and the energy between the core\n(C) and the c.m. of the halo neutrons E(nn)\u2212C = \u0004yi . In the\nother Jacobi system (Y) we examine the neutron-core relative\nmotion energy ECn = \u0004xj and the energy between the c.m.\nof the core-neutron and the second neutron E(Cn)\u2212n = \u0004yj .\nThe total continuum energy E\u03ba and the three-body phase\nspace \u221a\u0004x\u0004yd\u0004xd\u0004y are invariant with respect to the choice\nof a binary partition (E = \u0004x + \u0004y = Enn + E(nn)-C = ECn +\nE(Cn)-n and k2xdkxk2ydky = 2(m\/h\u00af2)3\u221a\u0004x\u0004yd\u0004xd\u0004y).\n064612-2\nTHREE BODY CONTINUUM . . . . III. SHORT-RANGE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 064612 (2007)\nIn practice all possible information about the three-body\ncontinuum structure is extracted from nuclear reactions, where\nhowever the interplay of reaction mechanism and the structure\nof initial and final states makes this task difficult. Only for\nsituations at sufficiently high energy, where we can assume\none-step nuclear reactions, or reactions with well-defined\nmechanisms (e.g., electromagnetic), can we give reasonably\nsimple connections between the nuclear structure and reaction\nobservables. Thus the expression for the differential cross\nsection (Eq. (2.1) from [7]) for elastic breakup, contains the\ntransition matrix element\nTf i = \u3008\u03c7 (\u2212)0 (kf ) \u00070 \b(\u2212)(kx,ky)|\n\u2211\np,t\nVpt |\b0\u00070\u03c7 (+)0 (ki)\u3009.\n(1)\nIn this matrix element (brackets \u3008\u3009 means integration over\nall spatial coordinates) the product of the internal target wave\nfunction\u00070 with the distorted waves\u03c7+0 and\u03c7\n\u2212\n0 corresponding\nto relative motion in the initial and final channels is folded\nwith the transition matrix element between g.s. and the three-\nbody continuum of the Borromean projectile \u3008\b(\u2212)(kx,ky) |\u2211\np,t Vpt | \b0\u3009. The Vpt , the interaction between projectile\nand target nucleons, is thus integrated over the distorted waves\nand the internal target wave function \u00070. After integration\nover the scattering angle of the full c.m. motion, we obtain an\napproximately factorized expression for the differential cross\nsection for fragmentation in the center of mass of the projectile:\nd6\u03c3 \u223c\n\u2211\nJf ,j,l,s\nF (Ei,Ef )Jf \u00b7 dBJf (j ls)d3kxd3ky. (2)\nThis factorization follows because\n\u2211\nVpt is composed of\neffective nucleon-nucleon short-range nuclear interactions Vpt\nbetween projectile (p) and target (t) nucleons, which for small\nexcitation energies can be treated as being approximately\nof zero range. The Coulomb long range pair interaction is\nhowever also contained. The reaction dynamics is mainly\ndetermined by the transferred total angular momentum j , the\norbital angular momentum l, the spin s and the transferred\n(linear) momentum. The functions F (Ei,Ef ) in the above\nequation are smooth functions of the excitation energy E in\nthe limit of Ei,Ef \u0007 E, when a one-step process dominates.\nThe double-differential correlated response, after integrat-\ning over the four-dimensional angular parts of the momenta of\nthe scattered particles, and averaging over the initial M-states\nand summing over final states (we omit spin variables for\nsimplicity), becomes\nd2BJf (j ls)\nd\u0004xd\u0004y\n\u221d \u221a\u0004x\u0004y\n\u222b \u2223\u2223\u3008Jf \u03c0f \u2225\u2225 \u02c6Tlsj\u03c4 (r)\u2225\u2225 Ji\u03c0i\u3009\u2223\u22232 d3rd \u02c6kxd \u02c6ky.\n(3)\nThe bracket \u3008\u3009 designates integration over internal coordinates\nand summation over spins, and r corresponds to the external\nfield (see below) exciting the projectile. This expression\nincludes the cases of long-range electromagnetic and short-\nrange nuclear correlated responses. The zero-range nuclear\ntransition operators T Tlsjmj \u03c4 and Coulomb multipole operators\nT Elm for point-like particles, referred to the projectile center of\nmass, are given by\n\u02c6T Elm(r) =\n3\u2211\ni=1\nzi\n\u03b4(r \u2212 ri)\nri2\nr liYlm(r\u02c6i)(l > 0) (4)\nand\n\u02c6T Tlsjmj \u03c4 (r) = v0\n3\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4(r \u2212 ri)\nri2\n[Yl(r\u02c6i) \u2297 \u03c3s(i)]jmj t\u03c4 (i). (5)\nHere zi = eZi are the electric charges and v0 is the strength\nof the external field. Inelastic and charge-exchange reactions\ncorrespond to isospin transitions T = 0 and 1, respectively.\nIn the generic one-step transition amplitude (using the\ntransition density for the nuclear operator with v0 = 1)\nTf i(r) =\n\u2211\nJf ,j,l,s\n\u3008Jf \u03c0f\n\u2223\u2223 \u02c6T Tlsj\u03c4 \u2223\u2223 Ji\u03c0i\u3009, (6)\nwe really should use a full final state wave function, and not\nthe asymptotic form as in [3], as this wave function includes\nthe intrinsic properties of the continuum. One alternative to\nthe solution of differential equations is the more transparent\nsolution of a Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation where\nthe sum of a plane wave and of the scattered (hyper)spherical\nwave is a solution in the whole space. Therefore, in breakup\ntype reactions the correlated response of Eq. (3) should\ncontain three terms: the \u201cno final state interaction (NoFSI)\u201d\nterm, the FSI term and an interference term. To extract\nconclusions about three-body properties, in particular about\nbinary subsystems, we should inspect both the \u2018NoFSI\u2019 (as\nthese often resemble g.s. energy\/momentum correlations) as\nwell as the FSI transitions, where the intrinsic properties of\ncontinuum are intertwined with the g.s. correlations and where\nsome of the observables are influenced by the range of the\ntransition operator.\nIt should be noted here that it is enough to calculate the\ntransition amplitude in one Jacobi system, the most suitable\nfor antisymmetrization. Amplitudes in other systems can then\nbe obtained by kinematic rotations [22].\nGenerally, for a \u2018true\u2019 three-body resonance with given J\u03c0 ,\nthe 3 \u2192 3 scattering amplitude has the analytic property [23]\nAJ (E,\f\u03c15 ,\f\u03ba5) \u221d\nAJ (\f\u03c15 ,\f\u03ba5)\nE \u2212 (E0 \u2212 i\rT\/2) , (7)\nwhere E is the total energy calculated from the three-body\nthreshold, and E0 and \rT are the position and total width of\nthe resonance. This agrees with the resonant factorization of\nthe wave functions in the interior region, pointed out in our\nprevious article [2], and therefore the transition amplitude will\nhave the same resonant property.\nIn the ith Jacobi system and for small (\u0004xi, \u0004yi) values, the\nbehavior of the correlation function is defined by the phase vol-\nume \u223c \u221a\u0004xi\u0004yi and the lowest partial angular momenta lx, ly\nof the state J\u03c0 via kinematical multipliers \u0004lxxi\u0004\nly\nyi in the product\nof the hyperangular parts of the hyperspherical functions,\n\u03c8\nlxly\nK (\u03b1i)\u03c8\nlxly\nK \u2032 (\u03b1i), (sin2 \u03b1i = \u0004xi\/E).

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 064612 (2007)\nP a,bn are Jacobi polynomials (similar to Legendre polynomials\nP an in the spherical harmonics case).\nFor Borromean nuclei represented as core+n + n, the\ncorrelation function in the Y coordinate system, with \u0004xi =\nECn and \u0004yi = E(Cn)\u2212n , should be almost symmetrical about\nthe hyperangle \u03b1Y \u223c 45\u25e6 because of the antisymmetrization\nbetween the halo nucleons, but with a deviation that depends\non the ratio of the reduced masses for x and y motion.\nThe deviation from this symmetry is a recoil effect, which\ndisappears in the limit of an infinitely heavy core.\nIntegrating over \u0004xi or \u0004yi , we obtain the binary energy\ncorrelations, which are subject for various conclusions in\ndiscussions of experimental data. In Sec. III we discuss two\nkinds\u2014NoFSI and FSI\u2014of nuclear type energy correlations\nin 6He. First we outline some general features.\nB. Energy correlations for NoFSI\nIf we use a (halo neutron) antisymmetrized three-body\nplane wave [1] as the final state, the expression (3) for\nthe correlated response gives the g.s. energy (momentum)\ncorrelations for the T000 transition operator, a Fourier-like\ntransform, and this is often used for Serber-type reaction\nmechanisms. Generally this reflects the uncertainty principle\nand might reveal the spatially correlated structure of the g.s.\n(or g.s. momentum correlations).\nHigher transition multipoles also serve for calculating\n\u2018NoFSI\u2019 nuclear break-up reaction cross sections with a\nzero-range nuclear perturbation (5). They reflect only the g.s.\nperipheral correlations and are treated as a reference for the\ncase when the FSI is switched on.\nC. FSI energy correlations\nWe will focus on the low excitation energy breakup of\nhalo nuclei, which only involves a moderately large number\nof final partial waves.

The profile of the ridge could however vary\nbecause, in the transition matrix element, the g.s. plays the role\nof an angular-spin filter for different partial components.\nFor qualitative and semiquantitative understanding we can\napply the analytic properties of the transition amplitudes in\nthe region of a true three-body resonance (E0, \rT). In order to\nhave a reference case where analytical estimates are possible,\nthe following approximation is useful. Inspired by the close\nanalogy between partial wave expansions in the two-body and\nthree-body problems, we consider, in first approximation, only\nthe diagonal parts of the continuum wave function. In the\ninterior region, (for given J\u03c0 ) the resonant three-body wave\nfunction takes the form given in [2] (neutron spins are not\nindicated explicitly and the kinematic singularity 1\/\u03ba5\/2 is\nincluded):\n\u03c8(\u03c1,\f\u03c15 ;E,\f\u03ba5)\n\u221d 1(\u03ba\u03c1)5\/2\n\u2211\nK,\u03b3\nGK\u03b3 (E)\u03c8RK\u03b3 (\u03c1)YK\u03b3 (\f\u03c15 )YK\u03b3 (\f\u03ba5), (10)\nwith\n|GK\u03b3 (E)|2 = \rK\u03b3(E \u2212 E0)2 + \r2T\/4\n.

(16)\nNote that for shape (16), because of the proximity to the\nenergy threshold, neither the position Em of the maximum\nor its width \r\u2032 correspond to the pure Breit-Wigner conditions\nof Em = E0 and \r\u2032 = \r0. It is possible to find Em in Eq. (16)\nby setting the derivative of the right hand side to zero, but it\nis simpler to find the minimum of the denominator in Eq. (16)\n, which gives almost the same result. Writing the denominator\nf (E) in a Taylor series around the minimum, f (E) =\nf (Em) + f \u2032\u2032(Em)(E \u2212 Em)2\/2, we find the relations Em\u0001E0\nand \r\u2032 = \u221a8f (Em)\/f \u2032\u2032(Em) < E0\/2 for any values of the\nparameters E0 and \r0.\nAs an example, we consider hypothetical monopole and\ndipole resonances. For a 0+ state, K0 = lx = ly = 0 in both\nT and Y systems, and the cross sections (15) are symmetric\nwith respect to (\u0004x, \u0004y) permutations and are the same for both\nJacobi systems. For 1\u2212 the hypermoment K0 = 1, and the\nangular momenta (lx, ly) take values (0, 1) and (1, 0). Since\nthe two halo neutrons on average attract (repulse) each other for\ns-wave (p-wave) motion, the component with (lx, ly) = (0, 1)\nis expected to dominate for dipole excitation in T and gives\na cross section asymmetric in (\u0004x, \u0004y). In Y this cross section\ncorresponds to motion with angular momenta (0, 1) and (1, 0)\nwith approximately equal weights, and the shape of cross\nsection (15) is close to symmetric.\nFrom Eq. (15) it follows that the contour plot of the cross\nsection \u0007(\u0004x, \u0004y) = d2\u03c3\/d\u0004xd\u0004y has special patterns in the\n(\u0004x, \u0004y)-plane for T and Y in the presence of a three-body\nresonance. A quantitative tool, which can be useful for\ncomparisons with the real cross sections, is the trajectory\nof the cross section ridge. This trajectory follows the curve\n\u0004y = \u0004y(\u0004x) which is defined by an extremum of the directional\nderivative of the function \u0007(\u0004x, \u0004y) in the (\u0004x, \u0004y)-plane. In the\nregion where the cross section is not small, the trajectory can\nbe well approximated by a solution of the simpler equation\n(d\u0007\/d\u0004\u2032x)|\u0004\u2032y=const = 0, which can be obtained by a rotation of\n\u03c0\/4 of the initial coordinate system: \u0004\u2032x = (\u0004x + \u0004y)\/\n\u221a\n2, \u0004\u2032y =\n(\u2212\u0004x + \u0004y)\/\n\u221a\n2.\nFigure 1(b) shows the contour plot, obtained from Eq.

Figures 1(c) and (d) show contour plots and\nridges for the 1\u2212 state in the T and Y systems, respectively.\nThe corresponding spectrum of the three-body resonance from\nthe approximate formula (16) [dashed line in Fig. 1(a)] is fitted\nto the calculations (solid line) of the dipole nuclear response\nobtained in our P2 model [17]. Agreement of ridges in real\ncross sections with the ridges in Fig. 1 provides an opportunity\nto judge whether or not a peak in E is a \u2018true\u2019 three-body\nresonance.\nIn the following sections using the examples of 6He we shall\ndemonstrate the most important cases of three-body energy\ncorrelations:\n(i) Energy correlations for narrow three-body resonances;\n(ii) Energy correlations for wide three-body resonances;\n(iii) Energy correlations for three-body virtual-like excita-\ntions.\nD. Binary energy correlations from narrow three-body\nresonances\nThe energy correlations between two particles with corre-\nsponding relative motion energy \u0004x , or between a pair and\nthe third particle with relative energy \u0004y , can be obtained\nafter integration of Eq. (15) over the unobserved energy \u0004y\n(or \u0004x). We wish to determine the general effects on the\nbinary Jacobian energy correlations of a possible low-lying\nthree-body resonance with width \rT \f E0. Since the resonant\ndenominator is a rapidly varying function we can fix the\nslowly-varying residual part to its value at a point close to\nthe resonance position \u0004x + \u0004y = E0, and move it outside\nthe integral. For example, for correlations between particles\narising from a narrow three-body resonance, we are left with\nthe dependence\nd\u03c3 (2)\nd\u0004x\n\u221d\n\u2211\nlx ly\n(\u0004x)lx (E0\u2212\u0004x)ly\n\u221a\n\u0004x(E0\u2212\u0004x)\n\u00d7\n\u222b\nd\u0004yi\n(\u0004xi+\u0004yi\u2212E0)2 + \r2T\/4\n. (17)\nThe distribution over \u0004y is the same after exchanging x and\ny. The integral is equal to (\u03c0 \u2212 2 arctan(2(\u0004x\u2212E)\/\rT))\/\rT,\nwhich varies between \u03c0\/\rT and 2\u03c0\/\rT.\nFor 6He, 11Li and other Borromean nuclei the natural\nparity states for the halo neutrons are J\u03c0 = 0+, 1\u2212, 2+ and\nlowest possible Jacobian angular momenta should be con-\nsidered. If lx = ly the distribution is symmetric around the\nmaximum \u0004x = E0\/2, and has characteristic behavior \u0004lx+1\/2x\nat the origin. For lx \r= ly , the maximum is located at \u0004x =\n(lx+1\/2)E0\/(lx+ly+1). At low energy \u0004x the nonresonant\ncontinuum has a shape given by Eq. (17). The binary energy\ncorrelations for 6He will be discussed in more detail in the next\nsection.\nIII. ENERGY CORRELATIONS IN 6HE\nA full range of methods, developed in previous papers to\nexplore three-body continuum structure, has been applied to\n6He, which is used as a reference case for more complicated\nhalo nuclei. In addition to the sharp 2+1 resonance at 0.8 MeV\nabove the three-body threshold, a second 2+2 resonance was\npredicted at 2.1 MeV with width \r \n 1.4 MeV (a lower limit\nsince the true width can not be defined because of strong\nasymmetry), a 1+ resonance at E = 2 MeV, \r \u223c= 1.2 MeV;\nand 0+ excitation peaking atE = 1.6 MeV with\r = 1.5 MeV.\nThe nature of the so-called \u201csoft dipole mode\u201d suggested in\n[24], and responsible for an abnormally large electromagnetic\ndissociation cross-section, still needs more clarification [25].\nVarious attempts [1,26\u201334], based on the same cluster repre-\nsentation of 6He, have not given a definite answer concerning\nthe existence of a dipole resonance state in 6He. The first\nexperimental results, where the dipole response function\nof 6He in EMD was reconstructed [11], did not show the\n1\u20132 MeV sharp peak in the dipole strength function obtained\nin some three-body approaches. Recently the experimental\nbinary angular and energy correlations from fragmentation of\n6He on Pb were published [12]. Our theoretical calculations\n[35] within the microscopic four-body distorted wave model\ndescribe well the experimental data for fragments correlations\nnear breakup threshold but with increasing excitation energy\nof 6He some of the theoretical distributions deviate from\nexperiment.\nIn early break-up experiments only the momentum dis-\ntribution of one fragment, or binary correlations (angular,\nmomentum or energy) were observed. As reference cases, the\nbinary channels involving physically significant states, i.e.,\npronounced resonances or virtual states, are included in the\nanalysis in part C of this section. Usually they correspond to\nthe knock-out of one of the fragments leaving the other two\ninteracting with small relative energy. In this case the final\nstate wave function is factorized into a relative motion of the\ntwo interacting fragments and a nearly plane wave for the third\nfragment. In the 6He case there are two significant channels:\n5He in the 3\/2\u2212 resonant state and the virtual 1S0 state in\nthe nn channels. At low excitation energies these channels\nare coupled and the resulting correlations between fragments\nwill be strongly influenced by channel interplay, leading to\na continuum structure differing from a simple sum of binary\nresonances. Later we will discuss energy correlations: (A) in\nthe g.s., which corresponds to Serber model without final state\ninteraction (NoFSI) for 0+ as well as transitions to other states;\nand (B) for the transition energy correlations for reactions with\nfull FSI for continuum states.\nThe part of the nuclear transition operator of Eq. (5) which\nacts on halo neutrons is used for illustration of correlated\nresponses. The part of Eq. (5), acting on the core [which gives\na vanishing cross section by Eq. (2) in the limit of infinitely\nheavy core] as well as the Coulomb dipole operator give almost\nsimilar energy correlations.\nIn all cases we present three-body and two-body energy\ncorrelations, and for all combinations of Jacobi coordinate\npairs. In Figs. 2, 3, and 4 below, the lowest natural parity final\nstates for 6He are included.\n064612-6\nTHREE BODY CONTINUUM . . . . III. SHORT-RANGE . . .

NoFSI three-body energy correlations in 6He\nNoFSI energy correlations are obtained by putting the\nantisymmetrized three-body plane wave from Ref. [1] as final\nstate into the expression for the transition amplitude from\nnuclear responses of Eq. (5).\nThe correlation plot for the monopole 0+ continuum (upper\nrow in Fig. 2) corresponds to the Serber model (NoFSI in\ncontinuum) and demonstrates an important property of the\ng.s.: the presence of spatial correlations from a \u2018Pauli focusing\u2019\neffect [4,36], which generates spatial \u2018dineutron\u2019 and \u2018cigar\u2019\nconfigurations, and correspondingly two peaks in the Enn \u2212\nE\u03b1-(nn) T-system correlation plot.\nThis clearly reflects the two-dimensional uncertainty prin-\nciple: the peak at Enn \u223c 10 MeV and small E\u03b1-(nn) is a\nconsequence of the \u2018dineutron\u2019 with a small distance between\nthe halo neutrons, while the peak at Enn \u223c 2 MeV and large\nE\u03b1-(nn) is a consequence of the \u2018cigar\u2019. with a large distance\nbetween the neutron pair.\nThe higher probability of the narrow core-nn energy\ndistribution should to some extent be seen in longitudinal\nand transverse momentum distributions from fragmentation\nexperiments. The reduced probability of the peak with small\nnn relative energy, usually thought of as a virtual nn state,\narises from the lower \u2018cigar\u2019 peak, where the neutrons have an\nextreme spatial separation. These correlations in the laboratory\nframe were studied in detail in Ref. [37].\nThe NoFSI correlation plot for \u03b1-n and (\u03b1n)-n energies\nexhibits a p23\/2 main bump at 5\u20136 MeV, and an s21\/2 low energy\n064612-7\nB. V. DANILIN et al.

This mechanism gives narrow longitu-\ndinal and transverse momentum distributions of the core in\nfragmentation of 6He, but a too wide momentum distribution\nfor the halo neutrons.\nFor larger multipolarities of the final states, the asymptotics\nin the classically forbidden region (halo) will play a greater role\nin the overlap integral Eq. (3) because of centrifugal screening\nof the internal part of the g.s. wave function in the transition\nintegral.\nThe correlation plots for the dipole 1\u2212 mode (upper row\nin Fig. 3) have a remarkable feature: a very pronounced core-\nneutron 5He correlation at an energy about 1 MeV in both \u03b1-n\nand (\u03b1n)-n systems, reflecting however the spatial extent of\nthe g.s. (halo structure). The dipole mode has the best spatial\noverlap with the g.s. among the 0+, 1\u2212, and 2+ plane wave\ncontinuum states. This can imitate final state interactions, or\nindicate the presence of a \u2018ready made 5He\u2019 in the g.s.

Transition energy correlations for reactions (FSI)\n1. Energy correlations for narrow three-body resonances\nThe transition correlation plots for the 2+1 resonance in\nFig. 4 (lower row) are very similar to the intrinsic correlations\nin Ref. [3], and are determined by the three-body resonance\nnature of the final state and by perfectly overlapping radial\nwave functions for the g.s. and the resonantly amplified internal\npart of the 2+1 continuum state. The transition to the 2\n+\n1\nresonance has an amplitude which is three orders of magnitude\ngreater than that with a three-body plane wave as the final-state\nand energy correlations with FSI are completely different from\nthe case of NoFSI (upper row).\n2. Energy correlations for wide three-body resonances\nThe second 2+2 resonance is shown in Fig. 5. It exhibits a\nthree-body resonant-like structure in contrast to the intrinsic\nenergy correlations in Ref. [3] where only the s-wave n-n\nvirtual state stands out. The reason is that the halo g.s. plays the\nrole of a filter, cutting off impact parameters which correspond\nto hypermoments K > 2 and selects the lowest K = 2 in\nwhich the resonance still exists. In the T system it has an\nasymmetric shape due to the strong influence of the virtual nn\ncorrelation. Since the 2+2 resonance state has a different Young\ntableau symmetry from the g.s., the transition probability\nintegrated over the resonance region is about 10 times less\n064612-9\nB. V.

The maxima ridge line \u0004x + \u0004y = 1.5\nMeV corresponds in both T and Y systems to the peak in\nthe response function and also to a resonant behavior in the\neigenphase, crossing \u03c0\/2 at energy of about 2 MeV for 2+2 .\nThis visible difference in the maxima ridge compared with\nFig. 10 from our previous paper [3] is due to interference with\nbackground in 3 \u2192 3 scattering in [3].\nThe correlated response for the 1+ resonance, shown by\na contour plot in Fig. 6, exhibits a three-body resonant\nstructure quite similar to 2+2 . The cutoff by the g.s. size filter\nselects also here the resonant hypermoment K = 2. For the\nsame reason, the transition probability integrated over the\nresonance region is again an order of magnitude less than\nfor 2+1 . The ridge line \u0004x + \u0004y = 2.8 MeV in both T and Y\nsystems has a corresponding line in the intrinsic correlation\nplot [3]. The peak in the response function and the resonant\nbehavior are again due to two almost coinciding eigenphases,\nof different physical origin, which cross\u03c0\/2 at energies around\n2.4 MeV.\n3. Energy correlations for three-body virtual-like excitations\nThe monopole 0+ transition correlations (Fig. 2) reveal a\nstrong combined influence of FSI in the continuum and of\nthe g.s. structure. Since for a zero-range nuclear transition\noperator the response is zero due to orthogonality of the\ng.s. and continuum wave functions, a finite range transition\noperator has been used. Hyperradial matrix elements of any\nshort-range operator (i.e., decreasing faster than exponentially)\nhave the universal behavior 1\/\u03c13 in the monopole case. We\nuse a form factor 1\/(1 + (\u03c1\/\u03c10)3) with range \u03c10 = 5 fm.\nThe partial composition of the wave functions is about 80%\nspin S = 0 with dominant zero orbital angular momenta in\nT, and about 18% spin S = 1 with orbital angular momenta\nlx = ly = 1. Comparison with the g.s. energy correlations\n(NoFSI case in Fig. 2) shows similarities in the general\nbehavior. Both have two wings in the T system, reflecting\nthe g.s., but the scales of the wings in the T system and of\nthe peak in Y are larger by orders of magnitude for FSI.\nFigure 2 shows that in the T system the g.s. energy corre-\nlations have peak positions at En\u2212n = 9 MeV, E\u03b1\u2212nn = 1.5\nMeV and En\u2212n = 1.5 MeV, E\u03b1\u2212nn = 13 MeV while for FSI\ntransition correlations En-n = 0.8 MeV, E\u03b1\u2212nn = 0.15 MeV\nand En\u2212n = 0.15 MeV, E\u03b1\u2212nn = 1.3 MeV. The FSI peak at\nEn\u2212n = 0.8 MeV, E\u03b1\u2212nn = 0.15 MeV (its narrow part) comes\nfrom intrinsic continuum properties (Fig. 6 in Ref. [3]), and\nalso generally reflects an interplay of the g.s. (\u2018dineutron\u2019 and\n\u2018cigar\u2019 spatial configurations) and the FSI in the continuum,\nenhancing the soft part of spectrum.

A low energy enhancement at En-\u03b1 = 0.4 MeV,\nEn\u03b1\u2212n = 0.4 coincides with an analogous peak for intrinsic\ncontinuum correlations and reflects their influence.\nThe largest g.s. and continuum components K = 2, lx =\n0, ly = 0 in theT system give 80% of the peak value, and define\nthe same \u2018dineutron\u2019 (small En-n) and \u2018cigar\u2019 (small E\u03b1-nn)\ncorrelations. As was expected, large correlation distances\n\u223c15\u201320 fm from K = 6\u201310 in the continuum are suppressed\nby the limited size of the g.s., and the second bump in the\nT system at \u223c3 MeV (which appears for intrinsic continuum\ncorrelations [3]), is not seen in FSI transitions. The largest\ncomponent K = 2, lx = 0, ly = 0 in the T basis corresponds\nalmost completely to K = 2, lx = 1, ly = 1 in the Y system,\ngiving a one-peak structure.\nIn the T system, correlations at small E\u03b1\u2212nn and En\u2212n\nare caused by s-waves in accordance with the dominating\ncomponent K = 2, lx = 0, ly = 0, which gives a correlated\nresponse\ndB\ndE\u03b1-nndEn-n\n\u221d\n(\nE\u03b1\u2212nn \u2212 En-n\nE\n)2 \u221a\nE\u03b1-nnEn-n.

(19)\nThe dipole 1\u2212 transition correlations shown in Fig. 3 have\nstructure that reflects the dominance of singlet n-n s-wave\nmotion (about 85%) in T. Two nearly symmetric peaks at\n1 MeV in Y (in n-\u03b1 and (n\u03b1)-n subsystems) are due to the\nnn antisymmetrization in the main s \u2297 p and d \u2297 p orbital\ncomponents, and their interference. At small energies s-motion\nprevails in both subsystems. The double-bell structure comes\nfrom K = 3, lx = 0, ly = 1 and is symmetric in l components,\nwhile the valley between them is due to K = 1, lx = 0, ly = 1\nmostly. The peak at E\u03b1\u2212nn \u223c En\u2212n \u223c 0.8 MeV is the memory\nof the g.s. spatial structure, which is seen in the g.s. NoFSI\ncorrelations plot in the same figure.\nPhysically there are two main decay channels having the\nhighest matching with the g.s. The first is the p3\/2 \u2018ground\nstate\u2019 of 5He, for which the internal part of the wave function\nis amplified in a compact region with large overlap with the\ng.s. of 6He. It is also kinematically favorable that the second\nneutron is in an s1\/2 state with zero centrifugal barrier. The\nsecond channel is the singlet n-n s-wave virtual state, in\ncluster T coordinates with relative orbital angular momentum\nl\u03b1\u2212(nn) = 1 due to dipole transition from the 6He g.s., which has\n85%lnn = 0, l\u03b1\u2212(nn) = 1 component. Therefore components\nwith lx = 0, ly = 1 and hypermoments K\u00013 will dominate\nthe dipole transition.\nIn the T basis only one peak in n-n relative motion appears\nat 0.8 MeV. This peak also comes from K = 1\u20133 with a\ncharacteristic s-wave shape at small energies. But the higher\nenergy intrinsic correlations, coming from K = 5\u201311, and\ncorrespond to a separation between the neutrons of about\n16\u201320 fm, have disappeared in transition correlation due to\nthe significantly smaller size of the g.s., which cuts the long\ndistance peaked continuum components, pushed out by high\ncentrifugal barriers.\nIn the T system, correlations at small E\u03b1-nn and En-n\nare caused by dominant s-wave nn motion [K = 1(3), lx =\n0, ly = 1], which gives a correlated response proportional to\ndB\ndE\u03b1-nndEn-n\n\u221d E\u03b1-nn\nE\n\u221a\nE\u03b1-nnEn-n. (20)\nIn the Y the Raynal-Revai transform gives a super-\nposition (lx = 1, ly = 0) \u2212 b(lx = 0, ly = 1). Therefore the\ncorrelations at small En-\u03b1 and En\u03b1\u2212n have a mostly s-wave\ncharacter because of antisymmetrization constraints. This\ngives a correlated response\ndB\ndEn-\u03b1dEn\u03b1-n\n\u221d (\n\u221a\nEn-\u03b1 \u2212 b\n\u221a\nEn\u03b1-n)2\nE\n\u221a\nEn-\u03b1En\u03b1-n\n(21)\nwith b \r= 1 due to the recoil effect, and b \u2192 1 for increasing\ncore mass.\nC. Two-body energy correlations in 6He\nThe two-body correlations depicted in Fig. 7 are obtained\nby integration of the three-body correlated responses over\nan unobserved pair energy. For all final states with natural\nparity, the distributions for both n-n and \u03b1-n are different\nfrom what they would be without final state binary inter-\nactions, which can be seen from the significant change of\npeak positions for NoFSI versus FSI three-body correlated\nresponses.\nAn effective mechanism that can impede binary FSI\ncan be illustrated by the example of the 2+1 reso-\nnance at E0 = 0.8 MeV in 6He. If we examine the\nleading p3\/2p3\/2 component in the Y system, where the\np3\/2 resonance in 5He is located at about the same energy,\nEn-\u03b1 \u223c 0.8 MeV, we can see from the correlation plot Fig. 4\nfor a narrow resonance, that due to limitation by the available\nphase space En-\u03b1 + En\u03b1-n = E0 set by the narrow resonance\nposition E0 and an almost equal sharing of the energy by\nthe \u03b1-n and (\u03b1n)-n subsystems, the formation of 5He will\nbe suppressed.\nIn the absence of a narrow three-body resonance, as in\ntransitions to the 0+ and 1\u2212 continuum states, the shape\nof \u03b1-n distributions is defined by the interplay of different\nconfigurations in the region of interaction, and by the possible\nchannels of decay. For the most interesting case, that of the\n1\u2212 dipole mode, the correlation plots for the full FSI, NoFSI\nand a free binary (\u03b1-n)p3\/2 interaction (\u20185He\u2019), i.e., with a\nnoninteracting third neutron, are shown in Fig. 8. The sharply\npeaked 5He correlation curve is scaled down by a factor of\nthree to demonstrate the deviation from the full FSI case. Due\nto antisymmetrization it is impossible to divide the distribution\ninto p3\/2 and s1\/2 parts since both halo neutrons spend \u201chalf\ntime\u201d in each. The soft (lower) part of the full FSI distribution\nhas s-wave nature, and both the virtual s-state in the n-n\nsubsystem and the s1\/2 partial state in \u03b1-n subsystem are\n064612-11\nB. V.

III. SHORT-RANGE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 064612 (2007)\nIV. CONCLUSION\nDifferent aspects of the three-body continuum were out-\nlined and discussed in our previous papers [1\u20133]. In this paper\nwe have concentrated on the three-body energy correlations\nin the nuclear type transitions from the g.s. to the three-body\ncontinuum using again 6He (and sometimes 11Li) as the test\ncase for Borromean systems. These transitions are the main\nbuilding blocks in one-step reaction theory where the transition\noperators intertwine the properties of the bound state with the\nintrinsic correlated structure of the three-body continuum. The\nbumps in the excitation spectrum, generated by three-body\nbreak-up reactions of diffraction type, have four possible\nsources: (i) true three-body resonances; (ii) Efimov-like (or\nvirtual-like) continuum structures; (iii) long lived binary\nresonance in one of the pairs; (iv) response of an extended\nsystem to long-range transition operators. To reach definite\nconclusions about the nature of resonant amplification it is\nnecessary to inspect two types of correlations: the correlations\nin the g.s. only (or no final state interactions), and transition\nenergy correlations with all final state interactions included.\nThe NoFSI is used in sudden approximation (or to some extent\nin the Serber break-up model), while the FSI is probed by\nnuclear and electromagnetic responses.\nThe uncertainty principle and halo structure of the bound\nstate are mostly responsible for the momentum (and energy)\ncorrelations in the g.s. and could be reflected in the specific\nconditions of transverse and longitudinal momentum distribu-\ntions in high-energy fragmentation reactions.\nThe spatial structure of the FSI continuum\nwave functions [2] shows a behavior in the internal\nregion that deviates markedly from that of a three-body plane\nwave with antisymmetrized halo neutrons. Thus a narrow\nthree-body resonant state is characterized by a localization\nin the region of mutual interaction of all three particles, and\ntherefore by a strong amplification of the interior part of wave\nfunction in this region. Due to high radial spatial overlap\nwith the g.s. (or with the reaction volume in the general\ncase) the transitions to these states are very strong. The\nS-matrix poles coincide with the peak energy in a resonant\namplification of the interior part of the wave function, and\nthe intrinsic energy-momentum correlations for 3-3 scattering\nalmost coincide with the transition energy correlations for\nreactions. The main criterion for the existence and properties\nof any intrinsic resonant state is that they should not depend\non the excitation mechanism. This serves as a signature for\nthe three-body resonant nature of an observed resonant-like\nenhancement in cross sections. We have shown that these\nenhancements are revealed in the structure of the energy\ncorrelation functions, and are most pronounced for the 2+1\nresonance in 6He, less so for the wider 2+2 and 1\n+\n1 resonances.\nThe origins of Efimov-like continuum structures are long-\nrange effective interactions between the three bodies with\nrange of the order of the sum of the scattering lengths\nin the binary subsystems. These are responsible for the\nbound state Efimov effect [18], and for the compression\nof continuum spectra near the three-body threshold. Their\npronounced inherent characteristic\u2014of a very long range of\nformation\u2014implies a large number of configurations in an HH\nbasis, a lack of pockets in the diagonal potential terms, and\nstrong off-diagonal (coupling) terms. A signal for possible\nexistence of Efimov-like \u2018three-body virtual\u2019 excitations is\nthe presence of virtual states and low-lying resonances in the\nbinary subsystems.\nWhen we deal with a Borromean halo, the neutron-neutron\ninteraction with scattering length \u223c16 fm is decisive for\nthis effect (\u2018continuum pairing\u2019). In this case there will be\nno concentration of the wave function inside the region\nof interaction of all particles, but a long range spreading\nof correlations, and the transition matrix element will have\noverlap of the bound state with a small fraction of the\ncorrelated part of the continuum wave function. Therefore\nthe intrinsic correlated structure of the three-body continuum\nitself, discussed in Ref. [3], will sometimes be strongly filtered\nby the g.s. structure.\nOur exploration of the binary energy correlations (n-n and\n\u03b1-n) in 6He has shown a complex interplay of the s-wave n-n\nvirtual state and thep3\/2 resonance in the\u03b1-n subsystem (5He),\nboth for monopole and dipole soft modes. In most cases these\ncorrelations differ strongly from \u201cfree\u201d binary correlations\nsince the presence of the third body in FSI is decisive.\nWe have shown that in three-body correlations for all con-\nfigurations, in spite of presence of a soft dipole resonance-like\npeak in both nuclear and electromagnetic response functions\nat \u223c1.5 MeV [1], there is lack of noticeable true resonant\nbehavior in the interior region, and the same applies for the\nmonopole case.\nThus we have demonstrated that transition energy cor-\nrelations serve as a useful tool for a detailed theoretical\nanalysis in three-body continuum spectroscopy. This tool will\nin forthcoming papers also be used for the case of 11Li where\nthe ground state is a strong mixture of p2 and s2 motions,\nadding new features to the Borromean continuum structure as\nwell.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was done with financial support from Bergen and\nUK from the EPSRC grants GR\/R\/25514 and GR\/M\/82141.\nB.V.D. and S.N.E. acknowledge support from RFBR grants\n05-02-17535 and 1885.2003.2.
