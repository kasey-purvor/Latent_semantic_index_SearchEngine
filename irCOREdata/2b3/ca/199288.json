A parallel argument is made in Philip Tetlock  (2005). Tetlock argues that specialists are actually less good at predicting events in their field as non-experts, having a tendency to over-extrapolate from the past to the future. This is, in many ways, unsurprising. After all, experts are not neutral observers but partisans who have a vested interest in explaining and predicting  a certain chain of events. As such, they have an in-built tendency towards motivated bias and groupthink, a point well made thirty years ago by Robert Jervis (1976) and more recently by Michael Freeden (2003). For illustrative examples of the struggles of some IR hedgehogs to incorporate unhelpful evidence and to predict major events in world politics, see the article by Robert Kaplan (1994), which predicted the imminent dissolution of Canada, and those by John Mearsheimer (1990, 1995) who, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, predicted the break-up of the EU and the dissolution of NATO, and advocated ceding nuclear technology to Germany so that it could act as a deterrent against Soviet aggression (despite Mearsheimer\u2019s concerns about the potential for a German invasion of Poland, and a war between Hungary and Romania).","cites":null},{"id":17324682,"title":"2 Although isolated examples of self-aware HSIR had appeared before this point, most notably in the work of Raymond Aron","authors":[],"date":"1986","doi":null,"raw":"2  Although isolated examples of self-aware HSIR had appeared before this point, most notably in the work of Raymond Aron (1986).","cites":null},{"id":17324690,"title":"22 On causal narratives, see Suganami","authors":[],"date":"1999","doi":null,"raw":"22 On causal narratives, see Suganami (1999); on superior stories, see Tilly (2005). 23 When asked what he considered to be the agents of social change, Braudel is said to have replied: \u2018forests and rivers\u2019.","cites":null},{"id":17324691,"title":"25 For more on this, see Lawson","authors":[],"date":"2005","doi":null,"raw":"25 For more on this, see Lawson (2005a).","cites":null},{"id":17324693,"title":"29 An excellent collection of articles on third-wave historical sociology can be found in Adams, Clemens and Orloff","authors":[],"date":null,"doi":null,"raw":"29  An excellent collection of articles on third-wave historical sociology can be found in Adams, Clemens and Orloff (eds.)

My thanks to Robbie Shilliam for making this point to me. 4 This is also a danger for the wider enterprise of historical sociology itself. There is, as far as I know, no department of historical sociology anywhere in the world. Rather, the division and subdivision of academic subjects into schools, faculties, departments and disciplines has served to spread historical sociology broadly but not deeply. Without its own institutional base from which to build, what at first appears to be a feast of historical sociology can begin on closer inspection to look more like a famine. 5 \u2018Let the buyer beware\u2019. 6 This fuzziness can also promote a conservative bias \u2013 the grounds of John Krige\u2019s critique of Fayerabend\u2019s philosophy of science. Krige makes the point that, \u2018if \u201canything goes\u201d, then everything stays\u2019. 7  It should be made clear from the outset that this exercise, as Rosenau points out, is performed with the intention of fostering \u2018healthy fervent\u2019 rather than reducing its participants to \u2018hopeless confusion\u2019. 8  Illustrative examples of fruitful interdisciplinarity include the concept of \u2018punctuated equilibrium\u2019, first mooted by the biologist Stephen Jay Gould to describe the switch-points in which long periods of stable reproduction within complex systems are punctuated by short, periods of rapid change. Gould\u2019s concept has been usefully transported into numerous \u2018soft\u2019 academic sciences. Another pertinent example is the concept of \u2018path dependence\u2019 which originated in economic history and has become used in many disciplines to describe how small initial distinctions are amplified over time, becoming substantial schisms which are then difficult to reverse.","cites":null},{"id":17324694,"title":"30 For more on these issues, see Mills","authors":[],"date":"1959","doi":null,"raw":"30 For more on these issues, see Mills (1959) and Rosenberg (1994b).","cites":null},{"id":17324659,"title":"A Disastrous Division\u2019,","authors":[],"date":"2005","doi":null,"raw":"Steinmetz, G.

However, even as historical \nsociology in IR (HSIR) has produced substantial gains, so there has also been a concomitant \nwatering down of the underlying approach itself. As a result, it is no longer clear what \nexactly HSIR entails: should it be seen as operating within the existing pool of available \ntheories or as an attempt to reconvene the discipline on new foundations? This article sets out \nan identifiable set of assumptions and precepts for HSIR based on deep ontological realism, \nepistemological relationism, a methodological free range, and an overt normative \nengagement with the events and processes that make up contemporary world politics. As \nsuch, HSIR can be seen as operating as an open society, a research programme and a \nvocation.  \n \n \n \n \nGeorge Lawson \nDepartment of Politics \nGoldsmiths College, University of London \nNew Cross  \nLondon SE14 6NW \n \nTel: 020 7919 7750 \nEmail: g.lawson@gold.ac.uk \n \n \n2 \nStock taking* \n \nThirty-five years ago, James Rosenau (1969) made an eloquent case for a stock-taking \nexercise which could clarify the principal aims, concepts and methods of the emerging field \nof foreign policy analysis (FPA). Rosenau wrote (1969: 1), \nEvery field of enquiry goes through an important and necessary stage during which \nscholars turn their attention to the kind of enterprise in which they are engaged. After \na prolonged period of concern with substantive matters, self-consciousness of purpose \ndevelops and questions arise about the road that has been travelled to date and the \ndirection which enquiry should follow in the future. At this point, histories of the field \nare written, exploration of its boundaries are undertaken, methods of research are \nsensitized, and the requirements of further theoretical concepts are re-examined. \nWhile it is not clear whether this process of maturation constitutes \u201chealthy fervent\u201d \nor \u201chopeless confusion\u201d, the nature and limits of the field eventually emerge with \ngreater clarity, thus enabling its practitioners to move on to the central task of \naccumulating knowledge through the investigation and interpretation of substantive \nmaterials.  \n \nThis article is a Rosenau-inspired stock-taking exercise into the use of historical sociology in \nInternational Relations (HSIR). Neither the broader enterprise of historical sociology nor the \nmore particular orientations of HSIR are, of course, the FPA\u2019s of their day. Historical \nsociology can be seen as at least two-centuries old (albeit depending to some extent on when \nand where you start counting) \u2013 an attempt by economists, philosophers of history and \nnascent sociologists to provide a historically sensitive, yet generally applicable, account of \nthe emergence of capitalism, industrialisation, rationalism, bureaucratisation, urbanisation \n                                                 \n* This article is a revised version of a paper presented at a meeting organised by the BISA \nworking group on Historical Sociology and International Relations at Goldsmiths College in \nSeptember 2005 and a panel held at the BISA annual conference at St Andrews in December \n2005. Many thanks to fellow panellists and participants at both events and, in particular, to \nJustin Rosenberg, Robbie Shilliam, Douglas Bulloch, Mike Levin, John Hobson, Bryan \nMabee and Fred Halliday for comments on earlier drafts.  \n \n3 \nand other core features of the modern world.1 Although the place of historical sociology \nwithin sociology suffered from the broader discipline\u2019s diversion into abstract theorising and \nits turf-wars with cognate rivals, historical sociology experienced something of a renaissance \nduring the late 1970s and early 1980s, around the time that a wave of self-consciously \nhistorical sociological work began to appear in IR.2 Over the last twenty years, the nexus \nbetween these two fields \u2013 historical sociology and IR \u2013 has borne substantial fruit: analysis \nof the origins and varieties of international systems over time and place (Watson 1992, \nSpruyt 1994, Buzan and Little 2000), exposure of the \u2018myth of 1648\u2019 (Osiander 2001, \nTeschke 2003), analysis of the non-Western origins of the contemporary world system \n(Wallerstein 1995, Gills 2002, Hobson 2004), work on the co-constitutive relationship \nbetween the international realm and state-society relations in processes of radical change \n(Halliday 1999, Lawson 2005a), examination of the social logic of international financial \norders (Seabrooke 2006), and exploration of the international dimensions of modernity itself \n(Rosenberg 1994a, 2006). HSIR is now a formally recognised, if still minority, approach \nwithin the discipline.  \n In which case, why the need for a stock-take? The answer is hinted at by Rosenau \n(1969: 1): \u2018After a prolonged period of concern with substantive matters, self-consciousness \nof purpose develops and questions arise about the road that has been travelled to date and the \ndirection which enquiry should follow in the future\u2019. So it is with HSIR. Even as substantial \ngains have been made, there has been a concomitant watering down of the underlying \napproach itself. HSIR seems to be sweeping up refugees from IR\u2019s methodological wars just \nas historical sociology embraced those exiled by sociology\u2019s internecine struggles thirty years \nago. As a result, it is no longer clear, if it ever was, what exactly HSIR entails: should it be \nseen as operating within the existing pool of available IR theories \u2013 as an attempt to join the \nrank and file of IR\u2019s puzzle-breakers, problem-solvers and safe-crackers? Or is HSIR better \n \n4 \nseen as an attempt to reconvene the discipline on entirely new foundations, perhaps \nreorienting IR more towards sociology and away from its current infatuation with \neconomics?3 In somewhat cruder IR terms, are HSIR-ers better seen as bandwagoners or \nrevisionists?  \n Failure to provide a consistent answer to these fundamental questions has contributed \nto a process of dilution in which HSIR has come to be seen as a catch-all term for any work \nthat contains historical, sociological and international sensitivities. There is a danger that, as \ncurrently constituted, HSIR\u2019s greatest strengths \u2013 its broad purview, its explanatory reach, \nand its balance between big ideas and empirical graft \u2013 could also become its principal \nweakness, engendering a lack of clarity that could reduce its overall value.4 Perhaps it is time \nto come clean about just what HSIR is about \u2013 on the grounds of intellectual honesty if \nnothing else. Caveat emptor!5 \nHSIR\u2019s \u2018anything goes\u2019 approach has been somewhat augmented by catholic \ntendencies within HSIR itself. Hence, a prominent advocate, John Hobson (2002), argues that \nthere are seven types of HSIR, ranging from post-modernists to structural realists \u2013 quite a \ncatch. At the same time, Hobden (2002) and Hobson (2006) claim that HSIR is the \u00fcber-\napproach to IR, a method followed by almost all IR scholars before the Waltzian ahistoricist \ndetour. While this descriptive definition has certainly been of value during the infancy of \nHSIR when alliances, for prudence sake, were made when and where they could be, there is a \ndanger that taking such a Feyerabend-ian \u2018anything goes\u2019 approach privileges inclusivity \nabove coherence, and risks uprooting HSIR from its own heritage in classical social theory.6 \nIf HSIR is to become a mature feature within the broad landscape of contemporary IR theory, \nwe need a better understanding of what it is, how it operates and where its boundaries lie.  \n In the first instance, therefore, this article is an attempt to ascertain just what HSIR\u2019s \n\u2018domain assumptions\u2019 (Gouldner 1970) are. It asks whether HSIR is best seen as a vocation, \n \n5 \nas a research programme or as an open society; whether it presupposes a particular ontology, \nepistemology, methodology or substantive agenda; what its relationship is and should be to \nother IR paradigms; and which other disciplines should be seen as its friends, siblings or \ncousins, estranged or otherwise. Providing some preliminary responses to these questions \nshould allow, as Rosenau puts it (1969: 1), \u2018the nature and limits of the field to emerge with \ngreater clarity\u2019. In the final analysis, the principal pay-off of HSIR will emerge from its \nsubstantive output. But if this enterprise is to achieve its widest possible impact, substantive \nwork needs to be premised on an identifiable set of assumptions and precepts which are \ncommonly shared and widely accepted.7 \n \n \nHistorical sociology as an open society \n \nHistorical sociology is as much a part of world history, institutional analysis and \ndevelopment economics as it is a sub-section of sociology, International Relations and \ncomparative politics. Historical sociology, therefore, has necessarily open borders. For HSIR, \nthis is especially important. In its broadest sense, historical sociology aims to unravel the \ncomplexity that lies behind the interaction between social action (both deliberate and \nunintentional) and structural forces (socially constructed but with an enduring authority and \ndynamic of their own). Hence, for HSIR-ers, international factors are juxtaposed, conjoined \nand connected with domestic variables with the aim of finding patterns that explain \ninternational processes: the general and regional crisis that provoke wars, varieties of \ncapitalist development, forms of imperialism and so on.  \n The principal benefit of historical sociology in IR is clear \u2013 it emboldens what Justin \nRosenberg (1994b) calls \u2018the international imagination\u2019. As numerous scholars have pointed \n \n6 \nout, much of mainstream International Relations is curiously unhistorical. In fact, realism (in \nall its variants) and neoliberal institutionalism share a predilection for seeing the international \nrealm, at least in terms of its structural dimension, as unchanging, in other words as existing \noutside history. Taking a static picture of the structure of world politics \u2013 the sovereign \nstates-system \u2013 irons out differences between political units, omits other global structural \nforces such as capitalism and reduces agency to the unit-level musings of statesmen, \nfinanciers and generals. In this way, mainstream IR has systematically truncated the study of \nworld politics by introducing a levels of analysis parlour game which reifies social processes \nand social facts \u2013 states, the market, sovereignty \u2013 as timeless analytical (and ultimately as \nontological) entities. In this way, much IR theory becomes home to what we might call a \n\u2018continuist mystique\u2019 in which the past is ransacked in order to explain the present. Thus, the \ncontest between Athens and Sparta is transplanted to the Cold War in order to elucidate the \nstand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union; all wars, whether they be guerrilla \ninsurgencies or total conflicts, are explained by international anarchy; and all political units \u2013 \ncity-states, nomadic tribes, empires, nation-states and transnational alliances \u2013 are \nfunctionally undifferentiated. What John Hobson (2002) describes as a \u2018gigantic optical \nillusion\u2019 generates an isomorphic homology of social kinds.  \n Historical sociology, which was in its post-war guise in part a reaction to the timeless, \nspaceless (and specious) general theory associated with Parsonian structural-functionalism, is \nwell suited to disentangling the synchronic mystique of much mainstream IR. Over the last \ntwenty years, HSIR has produced numerous works which have picked away at neorealist and \ninstitutionalist assumptions about the international realm. Justin Rosenberg (1994a, 2006) has \nfocused on the origins of modernity itself, laying bare the crude separation of state from \nsociety and states from markets carried out by political realism. John Hobson (2004) has \ndemonstrated the importance of understanding the global, long-term genesis of the modern \n \n7 \nstates-system. Fred Halliday (1999) has, in numerous texts, demonstrated the importance of \nvarious forms of social change in the making of the modern world, while scholars as far \nremoved as the critical theorist Andrew Linklater (1998) and the Marxist Benno Teschke \n(2003) have sought to contextualize and demythologize the foundational myth of Westphalia. \nBarry Buzan and Richard Little (2000) have shown in a detailed study how the international \nsystem changes in form and content according to time and place. \n But it is not only dyed in the wool HSIR-ers who are contributing to this form of \nresearch. Hence, Richard Price and Nina Tannenwald (1996) have used a historically \nsensitive, comparative analysis to show how the non-use of nuclear and chemical weapons \nhas, in large part, evolved over the last century from the interplay between a number of \ndomestic and international factors, constructing a standard of civilization that prohibits the \nuse of these weapons. Similarly, Martha Finnemore (1996, 2003) has illustrated how the \nnorm of humanitarian intervention has been constructed over time, starting with the \nprotection of Christians from persecution by the Ottoman Empire, and carried via the fight \nagainst slavery and decolonization into a universal concept of humanity. Other constructivists \nsuch as Christian Reus-Smit (1999) and Michael Barnett (2002) also adopt a historical \nsociological take on the institutional underpinnings of international orders and on the \nchanging functions of international organizations respectively. Like these constructivists, a \nnumber of neo-classical realists such as Fareed Zakaria (1999), Randall Schweller (1998), \nWilliam Wohlforth (1993), Thomas Christensen (1997) and Jennifer Sterling-Folker (2002) \nare looking at how the systemic pressures afforded by anarchy are translated through unit-\nlevel intervening variables, ranging from perceptions to civil-military relations. These \nscholars show that, without building in scope for ideology, perception, domestic state-society \nrelations and the like, structural realism fails to explain why states balance or bandwagon, \nhide or transcend, chain-gang or buck-pass.  \n \n8 \n The work of these constructivists and neo-classical realists, allied to the efforts of \nother IR notables such as Barry Buzan (2004), John Ikenberry (2003) and Stephen Krasner \n(1999), who also apply historical sociological methods within the English School, liberal and \nrealist traditions respectively, is not always self-consciously written as historical sociology. \nYet it could be described as such in that each of these studies is rooted in a diachronic \nunderstanding of the international realm, looking at how social action and social structures, \nand the social facts engendered by interaction between these two spheres, change over time, \ninhabiting a domain of both continuity and disjuncture. In the first instance, such works are \nempirically grounded studies of \u2018sufficient similarity\u2019, using several cases to generate causal \npatterns and wider inferences beyond either a universalistic program or a collapse into \nindeterminacy. As such, these studies take place within a research tradition dating back to \nMax Weber\u2019s attempt to provide an empirically rich, comparative study of social facts which \nhe used as a means to generate and evaluate a general argument. This conjoining of \ninterpretation and explanation (Verstehende Erkl\u00e4rung) uses awareness of particular contexts \nin order to derive a nuanced, causal explanation of ideal-types that potentially contains a \nwider import. It is this approach that, I argue, contains fertile ground for the study of world \npolitics. By tacking between empirical data, conceptual abstractions and causal explanations, \nas Michael Mann (1986) puts it, \u2018carrying out a constant conversation between the evidence \nand one\u2019s theory\u2019, it is possible to refine and refute, engage with and accumulate knowledge.  \n Of course, historical sociologists beyond IR\u2019s disciplinary boundaries have also \ncontributed to our understanding of international processes. Hence, Michael Mann (1986, \n1993) includes numerous international processes, including militarism, in his account of \nworld historical development, while Charles Tilly (1988) has helped to show the importance \nof warfare and capital accumulation to processes of state formation. These border raids create \nopportunities for what Bruce Carruthers (2005) calls \u2018constructive misbehaviour\u2019 \u2013 the \n \n9 \nchance for intellectual entrepreneurs to act as translators, borrowing concepts and data from \none academic discipline and introducing it into another.8 This act of arbitrage, when it is done \nwell, reduces levels of \u2018intellectual autism\u2019 (Steinmetz: 2005) \u2013 the narrowing of a field \nunder the watchful scrutiny of academic homeland security agents. What is more, \ndisciplinary travelling can help to deconstruct the mythical qualities of analytical shorthands \n(such as the state, society or anarchy) which are often reified, in the interests of little more \nthan academic partitioning, as ontological distinctions. \n However, it is important not to get too carried away with openness and fluidity both \nwithin disciplines and between them. Interdisciplinarity can engender thinness and sloppiness \nas well as promote depth and rigour. Indeed, some of historical sociology\u2019s raiding parties on \nvarious disciplines, including IR, has seen the misapplication of outdated concepts and \ntheoretical toolkits.9 It is, perhaps, inherent in interdisciplinary work that it is attracted to the \nmainstream of another subject rather than to the more interesting debates that lie beneath the \nsurface. Equally, hastening to interdisciplinarity can collapse the distinction between \nincommensurability and incompatibility. While the former conceives of HSIR as being \ncarried out within a relatively closed or autonomous research community, co-existing \npeacefully (if somewhat estranged) from other IR paradigms, the latter sees HSIR in open \nconflict with rival approaches, basing its raison d\u2019\u00eatre on contesting, refuting and falsifying \nsome of IR\u2019s foundational claims. In this sense, it is important not to obscure root-and-branch \ndifferences lest bridge-building become a metaphor for cannibalism, a means of amplifying \nthe narcissism of small differences, or of generating dilettantism. Better, perhaps, to try to \ncoax the broad field of HSIR into two major ideal-types which, with apologies to Isaiah \nBerlin, I will call \u2018hedgehogs\u2019 and \u2018foxes\u2019.10 \n \n \n10 \nHedgehogs  \n \nIsaih Berlin\u2019s (1953) essay \u2013 Hedgehogs and Foxes \u2013 distinguished between those who orient \nresearch around one big idea (Hedgehogs) and those who are sceptical of such ventures, \npreferring instead smaller scale interventions into particular fields (Foxes). Hedgehogs work \nfrom general abstractions to empirical material (when and where they deign to do so). This is \nthe stuff of grand theory, of foundational macro-schema operating above the rudiments, and \nto some extent the impediments, of events, action and experience. Hedgehog research \u2013 in \nlong-hand what we might describe as historically-nuanced social theory \u2013 stems from a \nrejection of induction as a means of generating verifiable, or refutable, social theory.11 \nCandidates include the Wallersteinian (1995) world-systems approach, Giddens\u2019 (1991) \nevocation of globalisation as the deep structure of the contemporary world, and Rosenberg\u2019s \n(2006) concept of uneven and combined development, all attempts to provide a hypo-\ndeductive, determinate modus operandi within which the principal contours of world history \ncan be derived. Hedgehogs bare a family resemblance to the Austrian School of economists, \ncentred around Carl Menger, who argued in the latter part of the nineteenth century that only \ndeductive, nomological, abstract reasoning would produce \u2018proper\u2019 theory that could generate \nuniversally applicable laws.12 Karl Popper (1957: 38), one of the progenitors of the \nnomological method, explains its virtues with his customary \u00e9lan, \u2018theories are nets cast to \ncatch what we call the world: to rationalise, to explain and to master it we endeavour to make \nthe mesh ever finer and finer\u2019.13  \n The strengths of such theorising are easy to distinguish \u2013 they are grand in scale and \nambition; often original, imaginative and fertile schema which generate and sustain \nsignificant research programmes. As such, they are exemplars of what Kuhn (1962) calls \n\u2018extraordinary research\u2019. Grand theory is often allied to parsimony and elegance, and those \nwho pull-off such a venture stand squarely on the shoulders of the illustrious theorisers of the \n \n11 \nnineteenth century. However, the weaknesses of abstracted grand theory, particularly in \nhistorical sociology, are also glaring. By focusing on (often single) underling determinants, \nthese theorists tend to omit the range of factors, long-term and short-term, material and \nideational, economic, social and political, that make up processes of large-scale change. This \nproduces a gap between theoretical assertions (analytical scope conditions), and historical \nanalysis (temporal and spatial scope conditions) which threatens to make the former static \nrather than dynamic, and the story of human history simple rather than complex. Such a \ntheory cannot be exhaustive; rather, it runs the risk of delivering internal elegance only at the \ncost of its analytical punch.14  \n All too often, hedgehogs overcome anomalies by pushing their idea into domains for \nwhich it is ill-equipped to cope. A good example of this is provided by contemporary \nneorealism. Following the end of the Cold War, neorealists struggled to explain the relatively \npeaceful change from a system of bipolarity to unipolarity.15 Although some advocates \nattempted a salvaging job on this apparent incongruity,16 they strained to maintain the \nefficacy of the theory given the apparent absence of great power balancing since 1989. The \nresult has been an increasingly fractious debate over the relative stability and durability of \nunipolarity, the concept of soft balancing, and, most notably, a \u2018back to the future\u2019 scramble \nin which many realists have resurrected classical theorists in order to re-introduce unit-level \ndimensions that were exorcised from the approach by Waltz and others.17 Given these two \nmajor discrepancies in neorealist theory \u2013 peaceful systemic change and an apparently stable \nunipolarity \u2013 it is more likely that such debates have marked a retreat from neorealism rather \nthan a modification or extension of its core precepts. As such, they represent the degeneration \nrather than the progression of neorealism as a research programme, a pertinent illustration of \nthe tendency of hedgehogs to swallow or slide away from unhelpful empirical anomalies \nrather than to ditch an idea which seems to be have been falsified.18  \n \n12 \n It is doubtful whether the determinate theories offered by hedgehogs can capture the \nparticularity of world historical development in all its intricacies, quirks and twists, at least \nnot in the depth required or with sufficient detail. To do so requires reducing history to a \nsecondary role, what Stanley Hoffman (1960: 135) calls, \u2018a grab-bag from which each \nadvocate pulls out a \u201clesson\u201d to prove his point\u2019. If world history is messy, complex and at \ntimes, contradictory, then a multi-causal analysis that finds common patterns, trends and \ntrajectories from empirical analysis rather than one which seeks to impose a monolithic order \non historical ambiguities is likely to yield a richer picture. After all, once they are applied, \ngeneral abstractions soon reach their limits. And sometimes the search for a master process \ncan seem akin to a search for the mind of God, a theistically driven desire for there to be \nintelligent design amidst the flotsam and jetsam of world history. \n The Italian political scientist Giovanni Sartori (1970) makes this point well. For \nSartori, at the extreme edge of abstraction lies the possibility of \u2018concept stretching\u2019 or \n\u2018straining\u2019 towards vague, amorphous crystallizations, pseudo-universals without either \nprecision or purchase \u2013 anarchy and globalisation being two such examples.19 The result is \nabstracted short-cuts leading to empirical short-circuits, failed attempts to apply rigid rules to \na changing, multi-faceted and complex world. By conducting theory \u2018at first remove\u2019 and by \nfocusing on the structural dimensions of world historical development, such analysis is \ninfused with a reductionism that loses touch with the uncertainty and, most crucially, the \nagency that lies at the heart of processes of large-scale change. But agency can neither be \nignored nor merely grafted onto an existing structural theory: the actions of individuals, \ngroups, organisations and the like play a formative role in the creation, process and resolution \nof processes of change. Mikhail Gorbachev was not a bit part player in the collapse of the \nSoviet Empire, nor was Bill Clinton in the construction of the liberal post-Cold War \n \n13 \nsettlement, and nor is President Bush and his entourage in the extension of the US imperium \ntoday.  \n  Far from being the passive bearers (Tr\u00e4ger) of overbearing structures, human agency \nis, at least in part, constitutive of processes of social change. Yet abstracted grand theorists \ngive us only a partial picture \u2013 one that, albeit unintentionally, can look like an inevitable tale \nor a pre-determined narrative. This entails not just a loss of agency, but also a failure to grasp \nthe second aspect of what Giddens (1984) calls the \u2018double hermeneutic\u2019 \u2013 the fact that the \ntheories that people use to make sense of social processes enter reflexively into the very \ncausal processes which they are theorising.20 Abstracted theory which relies on others \u2018under-\nlabouring\u2019 can produce little more than interpretation of others interpretations, what John \nGoldthorpe (1991: 211-230) calls \u2018incomplete speculations\u2019, \u2018pick and mix raids on history\u2019s \nsweetshop\u2019. All theories need to simplify reality in order to function as theories, but on \noccasion, simplification can become uncomfortably close to distortion. \n  \nFoxes \n \nFoxes, the second broad group of historical sociologists, can be seen as sociologically \noriented historians, those with their roots in idiographic methods. For most such historians, \nthe task of assigning patterns to history, let alone conducting any search for its determinant \ntrends, is futile, more likely to generate fools gold than findings of real value. As Robert \nNisbet (1969: 240-241) puts it, \n History in any substantive sense is plural. It is diverse, multiple, and particular. There \n have been innumerable histories since the first history of the first human group \n began \u2026 not only are there many histories, there are many chronologies, many \n times \u2026 many histories, many areas, many times! The mind boggles at the task of \n encapsulating such diversity within any empirically clear formula or synthesis. It \n cannot be done; not empirically, not pragmatically. \n \n14 \n \nGiven this starting point, the best that the researcher can achieve is what Michael Mann \n(1986: 4) calls \u2018proximate method\u2019 or what Jean-Paul Sartre (in Smith 1991: 231) labels as \n\u2018rational disorder\u2019 \u2013 an assemblage of history\u2019s multiple vectors into a kind of organised \nmess. After all (Mann 1986: 4), \u2018societies are always much messier than our theories of \nthem\u2019, and contingency, accident and indeterminacy are constant companions to world \nhistorical processes. For Mann and other historical sociologists in this bracket, there can be \nno story of ultimate primacy. Embracing the complexity of world history and accepting \nmultiple patterns of causation tends towards an inductive approach that builds from history to \nmid-range abstractions.21 The benefits of such an approach are clear \u2013 in terms of nuance, \ndetail and sensitivity, historical sociology of this type is unrivalled. \n However, such an approach also has its downsides. By stressing contingency, \naccident and particularity, there is a possibility that bigger, more important commonalities are \nmissed. At the very least, this runs the risk of \u2018overdetermination\u2019 \u2013 the provision of a \nshopping list of causes that includes all sorts of weak or insignificant factors in a vain attempt \nto provide a \u2018complete\u2019 explanation. Worse still, such an approach can collapse into \narbitrariness, incoherence, ad-hocery, and ultimately, into negativity, becoming analysis \nrather than theory, and sacrificing depth for broadness. Just because the world is complex, it \ndoes not mean that it is unknowable. Even if we can not see things as they \u2018really are\u2019, it is \nstill possible to conjure appropriate shorthands and metaphors that provide compelling \nnarratives into world history\u2019s gloaming. Most of the time, as Eric Ringmar (1996) points \nout, the research process of \u2018seeing as\u2019 encounters a relatively stable set of understandings \nand meanings. And there should be little inhibition to making a judgement that prefers one \nexplanation over another. Accepting particularity does not, therefore, entail abandoning the \nattempt to evaluate rival truth claims into the causal rhythms that punctuate world historical \nprocesses. Rather, the generation of causal narratives provides a means of telling superior \n \n15 \nstories \u2013 studies of causation that seek to explain the most important elements within \ncomplex social processes and to make sense of structural production, reproduction, reform \nand transformation.22 \n Nisbet and other researchers in this mould are surely right to insist that social \nexplanation tally closely with historical records. Here it is worth returning again to the work \nof Giovanni Sartori (1970). Sartori proposed that social science works within a ladder of \nabstraction ranging from general abstractions (genus) to mid-level taxonomies (class) to \nempirical analysis (species). For Sartori, social scientists would be best served by starting \nwith medium-level abstractions or hypothesis and working up and down the ladder of \nabstraction, testing whether their hunches fit both with more general concepts, and with the \navailable empirical material. For Sartori, this process of \u2018conceptual travelling\u2019 generates \n\u2018fact-storing containers\u2019 (empirical universals) which are geared at unravelling the interplay \nbetween homogeneity and heterogeneity, and which combine explanatory purchase with a \nhigh level of empirical content. Subsequently renamed by David Collier and James Mahon \n(1993) as a \u2018ladder of generality\u2019, Sartori\u2019s method seems particularly well suited to historical \nsociology, allowing concepts, categories and causal regularities to be properly assessed over \ntime and space, and in the process generating workable, theoretically compelling taxonomies \nand classificatory schemas. \n \nLumpers and splitters, sweepers and detailers \n \nIt is important to note that any hard distinction between these two ideal-types is unlikely to be \ncarried through in practice. Rather, the choice to be made is one of degree \u2013 as John Lewis \nGaddis (2001) argues, the difference between \u2018embedded theory\u2019 as practised by historians in \nwhich theory is subordinated to the overarching narrative, and \u2018encompassing theory\u2019, which \n \n16 \nsubordinates narrative to theoretical needs, is often one of aesthetics rather than principle. To \nadd a degree of precision, therefore, to our ideal-types, we may want to further nuance these \ncategories. Figure 1 attempts to do just this \u2013 providing a basic grouping of historical \nsociologists divided by two axis: the x axis runs between lumpers (holists) and splitters \n(instrumentalists), and the y axis between sweepers (abstractors) and detailers (historians). \nWhat this sub-division entails is four basic camps: in the top-left quadrant (lumpers\/ \nsweepers) can be found (neo)Marxists and structural functionalists; in the bottom-left \n(lumpers\/detailers) quadrant are predominantly world historians; in the bottom-right quadrant \n(detailers\/splitters) lie (neo)Weberians; and the top-right quadrant (sweepers\/splitters) is \noccupied by advocates of rational choice, network analysis and other, mainly US-dominated, \nmethodological pursuits.  \n \n Insert Figures 1 and 2 about here \n \n Figure 2 provides a more detailed mapping exercise which adds a further layer of \nsubtlety to these broad categorisations. By looking at how individual scholars map onto these \ntwo axis, it is possible to gauge the substantial variation within historical sociology. \nOrientation within the mapping exercise is best begun via its extreme edges. At the furthest \nremove of the sweepers\/lumpers is Talcott Parsons, doyen of structural functionalism. \nTowards the central point of this quadrant can be found Benno Teschke, an IR based neo-\nMarxist who incorporates substantive historical research and a fair degree of agency in his \nanalysis. Those who retain a firmer attachment to holism or structuralism, while also \nmaintaining a degree of historical nuance, such as Theda Skocpol and Barrington Moore, can \nbe found further along the west of the y axis.  \n Moving counter-clockwise into the bottom-left corner of the grid, the extremity is \nmarked by Fernand Braudel \u2013 patrician of the Annales School of French historians who were \n \n17 \nmuch taking with the slow-moving impact of geography and demography on world historical \ndevelopment.23 Braudel\u2019s evocation of the longue dur\u00e9e, change which takes place over eons, \nmarks him out as a lumper, but the extraordinarily richness of his historical research \u2013 each \nvolume of The Mediterranean (1972) alone runs to over a thousand pages \u2013 marks Braudel as \na consummate detailer. Moving east along the x axis takes one away from structuralism and \ntowards instrumentalism, while moving up the y axis denotes a higher degree of abstraction. \nHence, a researcher who focuses on the structural impact of demographic change, Jack \nGoldstone, is only just contained within this quadrant, while John Hobson, a world historian \nmuch influenced by Weberianism can be found edging towards the mid-point of the grid \u2013 \nHobson\u2019s research attempts to conjoin detailing and lumping, and to link instrumentalism \nwith a degree of conceptual abstraction.  \n Moving once more counter-clockwise around the grid we come to the bottom-right \nquadrant represented by splitters\/detailers. At the furthest edge of this quadrant is E.P. \nThompson, the British \u2018historian from below\u2019, who consistently emphasised the importance \nof taking individuals and individual agency as the basis for \u2018real\u2019 history.24 Interestingly, \nalmost directly above Thompson can be found Michael Mann\u2019s recent work on fascism. \nMann has followed a trajectory steadily eastwards across the grid, from the first volume of \nSources of Social Power (SSP) which places him, albeit marginally, among the lumpers and \ndetailers, to Volume II of SSP in which Mann moves just across the border into \nsplitters\/detailers and, most recently, towards the edge of this quadrant, a move predicated by \nMann\u2019s shift towards thick description and instrumentalism. Towards the centre of this \nquadrant can be found a number of prominent neo-Weberian historical sociologists including \nAnthony Giddens, Norbert Elias, and straying towards the instrumentalist hinterland of the x \naxis, Charles Tilly. \n \n18 \n Finally, moving into the top-right corner of the grid delineates the space occupied by \nabstractors\/splitters. The farthest position here is taken up by Michael Hechter and Edgar \nKiser, well known for their avocation of a rational choice strand within historical sociology. \nThis quadrant is less well occupied than the others \u2013 indicative of the fact that historical \nsociology is not particularly well suited to abstractions such as rational choice, particularly \nwhen this is conjoined with instrumentalism and methodological individualism.25 Towards \nthe centre of this quadrant lie some IR scholars who can be described as HSIR-ers even if \nthey do not often wear the label explicitly.  \n This grid indicates two key points: first, there is considerable variation within \nhistorical sociology. Historical sociologists appear as foxes and hedgehogs, lumpers and \nsplitters, sweepers and detailers on a broad continuum between universality and particularity, \nthick description and the generation of concrete universals. Historical sociology, therefore, is \nnot a homogenous field in which it is possible to lay down definite border positions \u2013 the \nenterprise is a prototypical open society. Second, the grid indicates that one of the central \ntasks of historical sociology (perhaps the central task), is to perform a balancing act between \ntheoretical and empirical work, and between recognising the complexity of the social world \nwhile at the same time ensuring that one does not become lost in minutiae \u2013 differentiating \nbetween normal abnormality and abnormal normality. This is the reason why C. Wright Mills \nappears at the centre of the diagram. Mills\u2019 clarion call for a sociological enterprise that \neschews both grand theory (abstraction without application) and abstracted empiricism \n(behaviouralist quantifications of human action) speaks directly to the historical sociological \nimagination \u2013 an imagination that, as Roland Dannreuther and James Kennedy point out in \ntheir contribution to this forum, is thriving, if unevenly so. \n \n \n \n19 \nHistorical Sociology as a research programme \n \nThe preceding section argued that historical sociology is a broad church containing its fair \nshare of zealots, converts and heretics. As it has developed, historical sociology has been \napplied within a number of formal disciplines and across a number of issue areas. Historical \nsociologists have asked important questions, probed at interesting puzzles, provided some \ncompelling hypothesis, and produced an array of empirical studies on subjects as varied as \nthe transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the development of manners. The promise of \nhistorical sociology, considered in this light, is rich indeed. Going beyond the broad \nparameters laid out above, this section delineatea some clear domains and guidelines within \nwhich advocates of HS can work. In other words, I am attempting to establish some basic \nground rules for historical sociological work \u2013 as Larry Laudan (1977) would have it, \u2018a set \nof ontological do\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u2019. Or as Imre Lakatos (1970) prefers, as a research programme \nwhich provides a sense of progress as it develops over time.26  \n \nOntological realism \n \nThere is no flawless frame for the construction of theory. Indeed, as C. Wright Mills (1959) \nwarns, working from a single ontology can create a \u2018transhistorical straightjacket\u2019 within \nwhich history is manipulated rather than given the chance to breathe. Nevertheless, the \ncurrent ontological framework within which much social science operates, as Heikki \nPatomaki and Colin Wight (2000) point out, exerts a similar straightjacket on research. \nPatomaki and Wight claim that the current choice available to scholars is little more than that \nbetween two narrow forms of realism: realism as sense data (the empirical, phenomenal \nrealism practiced by rationalists) and realism as language (the linguistic, inter-subjective \n \n20 \nnoumenal realism of post-positivists). From this perspective, reality is reduced either to \nimmediate experience or to an object of discourse, creating a shared ontological \u2018problem-\nfield\u2019 buttressed by secondary epistemological differences.  \n The focus of contemporary historical sociologists, just as was the case for classical \nsocial theorists, is somewhat different than this straightjacket allows, centring on the \nunderlying reality that provides the environment for everyday action, events and processes. \nThis deep-lying ontological realism (Bhaskar 1979, 1986; Collier 1994; Hollis 1994; Hacking \n1999), is primarily concerned with the principal structures that constrain and enable surface \nlevel experience and perceptions \u2013 the capabilities, tendencies and potentials that, to some \nextent, lie beyond individual understanding and agency.27 The aim of historical sociology has \nin the past, and should be today, to illuminate these structures and tendencies. This is the \nreason why so many historical sociologists have focused their attention on processes of \nradical change, or what Mann (1986) calls \u2018neo-episodic moments\u2019 \u2013 it is at precisely at these \ninstances that structural tendencies are revealed, reproduced, reaffirmed, reformed or cast \nanew.28 As Dennis Smith (1991: 1) puts it, \u2018one of historical sociology\u2019s objectives should be \nto distinguish between open doors and brick walls, and to discover whether, how, and with \nwhat consequences walls may be removed\u2019. \n Historical sociology, therefore, offers as one of its central imperatives an explanation \nof historical development itself. Recognising the complexity of world historical processes \nand agreeing that numerous causes lie behind what Charles Tilly (1984) calls \u2018master-\nprocesses\u2019 does not mean abdication from the central task of establishing the prime movers \nthat orchestrate these processes and the principal colours that define them. But rather than \nsubsuming or cloaking findings within readily available Hempelian \u2018covering laws\u2019, \nhistorical sociology aims to provide conceptual abstractions that, when conjoined with \n \n21 \nempirical work, provide explanatory contours that lie beyond and beneath the lurches and \nhiccups of world history.  \n \nPrincipia media \n \nA commitment to deep realism is the first dimension within the historical sociological \nresearch programme. Equally important is the work on the sociology of knowledge carried \nout by Karl Mannheim (1960), Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann (1967), and others, who \nconceive of knowledge gained into the social world as inherently relational rather than \nisolated or free-standing. Hence, the social world is revealed not through synchronic \nabstraction, but via diachronic conceptualisations. As Robert Nisbet (1969) writes, the \ntradition of social science in the west has, at least to some extent, emerged out of the Greek \nconcern with physis \u2013 the study of the origins and growth of things. As a result, being, at least \nfor classical social theorists, was a story of becoming \u2013 explaining change, development and \ngrowth become the central task of social theory. The medium by which to unravel the \ncomplex flows of these world historical processes was seen as causation. Hence, historical \nsociology became the task of establishing, pace Mannheim, principia media \u2013 the movement \nof social forms, relations and trends across time and place. This task, I think, can be seen as a \nsine qua non of historical sociology. Following from this, a secondary goal is to provide an \naccount of order, hierarchy and priority which these causal flows subscribe to, evaluating \nbetween what Aristotle calls \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018accidental\u2019 causes, Weber described as \n\u2018adequate\u2019 and \u2018chance\u2019 causation, and Nisbet describes as \u2018original\u2019, \u2018formal\u2019, \u2018motor\u2019 and \n\u2018final\u2019 causes. This is the pursuit of principium medium (concrete determinate trends) \u2013 the \napex of the causal staircase represented in Figure 3.  \n \n Insert Figure 3 about here \n \n22 \n \n Historical sociology, therefore, operates with a dual foundational toolkit: deep \nontological realism and epistemological relationism. It understands there to be an underlying \nsocial reality, but equally clearly understands that all social relations exist in constitutive \ninter-relation with others, hence the need to problematise difference, multiplicity and \ninteractions, to go beyond immediate context and to transcend narrow viewpoints. Rather \nthan compare reified, static social facts, this mode of research involves the study of the \nrelations, linkages and processes that make up the social world. In the first instance, this \ninvolves a temporal extension into the past. But it also requires a concomitant examination of \nthe spatial relationship between societies and social formations, in other words an inter-\nsocietal or inter-social perspective. If there is a motif that lies behind historical sociology, it is \n\u2018never forget time and place\u2019.  \n \nApplication, application, application \n \nMethodologically, historical sociology is promiscuous: historical sociology can be inductive \nor deductive, carried out at the macro, the meso or the micro levels, be based on constitutive \nor causal theory, and be conducted in a variety of guises: from ethnography to verstehen. At \none extreme is the promotion of rational choice historical sociology by Michael Hechter \n(1992), Edgar Kiser (1996) and others (see the various contributions in Gould (ed.) 2005), an \nattempt which has spawned a wide-ranging meta-theoretical debate which, in turn, has \nprompted significant work on relationalism (Emirbayer 1997, Somers 1998, Nexon and \nJackson 1999) path-dependency (Mahoney 2000, 2001; Goldstone 1998; Pierson 2004), \ntemporality (Aminzade 1992, McDaniel (ed.) 1996, Sewell 2005), historical institutionalism \n(Powell and DiMaggio (eds.) 1991; Steinmo, Thelen and Longstreth (eds.) 1992; Thelen \n2003, 2004;  Streeck and Thelen (eds.) 2005) and other such ventures. At the other extreme \n \n23 \nstands cultural, post-colonial and other \u2018third-wave\u2019 historical sociologies, well captured in \nthe work of Craig Calhoun (1996, 2003) and introduced into IR by Steve Smith (2002) and \nothers.29  \n Ultimately, though, there is only one methodological stricture presupposed by \nhistorical sociology: that it is applied. Historical sociology offers a powerful one-two \ncombination \u2013 history (a story of why things happened, when and how they did), allied to \nsociology (an explanation of why this is significant). It asks the simple but powerful question, \n\u2018so what\u2019? Without application, historical sociology loses this double strength, at the same \ntime minimising much of its value. Many contemporary debates in IR and other social \nsciences struggle in the face of battle scars caused by a century or more of turf wars in which \nborders have been constructed in order to seal off terrain and safeguard specialist knowledge. \nThe result is a splintered social scientific enterprise in which analytical shorthands have been \nreified as ontological distinctions and disciplinary partitions have been mistaken for \nsubstantive ones. One of the benefits of historical sociology is the refusal to see these \napparently incommensurable dichotomies as intractable. Hence, issues of agency-structure, \nmacro-micro, positivism-post-positivism are conceived not as theoretical, ontological or \nmethodological problems but as substantive ones \u2013 in other words as the study of how, in \ntime and place, human agency is constituted within social structures. In this sense, agency \ndoes not lie beyond or outside history but in history.30 And rather than reinventing the \nMethodenstreit ad infinitum or philosophical parlour-games ad nauseum, historical sociology \nis rooted in the substantive application of social relations as they are constituted in time and \nplace, followed by the examination of how far these social processes and social facts are \ngeneralisable across both time and space.  \n \n \n \n24 \nHistorical Sociology as a vocation \n \nHistorical sociology\u2019s methodological promiscuity is matched by the free-range of its \nsubstantive agenda. Although there has been a general predilection in historical sociology \ntowards big issues \u2013 systemic change, processes of state formation, wars, revolutions and the \nlike \u2013 this has not ruled out many smaller scale interventions into both meso-level and micro-\nprocesses, a point Bryan Mabee makes strongly in his article for this forum. What has been \ncommon to historical sociology in all its guises is a concern with normative, politically \nengaged work concurrent with an intellectual engagement into method, theory and \nsubstantive issues \u2013 hence Theda Skocpol\u2019s (2003) valorisation of historical sociology as \u2018the \ndoubly engaged social science\u2019. In this sense, historical sociologists recognise that facts are \nvalue laden, but that values too are factually embedded. And as Patomaki and Wight (2000) \nobserve, this leads to a simple desire to make values factually explained, and facts subject to \ncritical evaluation. The result is a connection, or perhaps a reconnection, between the world \nof ethical deliberation and the world of causal processes far removed from the banalities of \n\u2018value-free\u2019 abstract research programmes, \u2018orphans of the scientific revolution\u2019 (Puchala \n2003) as they are. Historical sociology stands in direct contrast to those approaches which, as \nSkocpol (2003: 412) notes, \u2018conspire to know more and more about less and less\u2019.  \n Hence a further critique of much of the contemporary academy, both in IR and \nbeyond, is its confusion of ends and means, and the endorsement of a bureaucratic enterprise \nthat serves to restrict intellectual freedom. The application of historical sociology as a \nvocation promises a double engagement (both political and intellectual) which marks a return \nto the concerns of classical social analysis. As such, the historical sociological imagination \nfavours the analysis of substantive problems and issues rather than technical approaches \npremised and assessed on the basis of methodological purity. In this sense, historical \n \n25 \nsociology is humanistic rather than abstract, seeking to connect the world of human agency \nand struggle with the apparently impersonal structural forces that seem to lie beyond our \ncontrol. Historical sociology takes human relations and their articulation and crystallisation in \nreal historical conditions as its central calling. Above all else, historical sociology promises \nthe study of \u2018we\u2019 rather than \u2018they\u2019, or \u2018it\u2019. \n HSIR is, therefore, not just an open society nor a research programme but a vocation \nprogressing on several fronts simultaneously: a central group of researchers providing \nempirical and theoretical depth supplemented by a range of networks generating breadth and \nfostering creative synergies. The view of HSIR conceived here is, in metaphorical terms, a \nform of what Eurocrats call \u2018subsidiarity\u2019 \u2013 the academic equivalent of a Schengen agreement \nin which a core-group of researchers produce works within a well-conceived and broadly \naccepted corpus. Augmenting this hub is a series of spokes or networks that reach out to \nothers, fostering ties and generating mutual competences. This is a project that speaks to the \nheart of the historical sociological imagination \u2013 respecting the particular intricacies of both \nhistory and academic specialisms, while at the same time remaining aware and committed to \nthe common threads and interests that unite work in the classical social science tradition and \nwhich underpin a broader normative engagement with the stuff of world politics. The result, \nas Dennis Smith (1991: 78) puts it, is, at least ideally, a \u2018process of never-ending \nexploration\u2019. \n It may be worth making one final remark lest the primary purpose of this article be \nlost amidst the preceding discussion. This stock-taking or ground clearing exercise has not \nbeen undertaken in order to engage in a lengthy bout of navel gazing, but with the intention \nof prompting a concerted period of substantive HSIR research. The French mathematician \nHenri Poincar\u00e9 once chastised sociology as the \u2018science with the most methods and the \nfewest results\u2019. Above all else, historical sociology should be the study of concrete reality \n \n26 \n(Wirklichkeitswissenschaft), an approach that asks new questions and develops an agenda for \nfurther research \u2013 as Craig Calhoun (2003: 437) puts it, \u2018opening up vistas for \nunderstanding\u2019. This is the principal reason for being open about the core dimensions of \nHSIR project \u2013 taking one step backwards in order to take two more forward. Thus, to some \nextent, having cleared the decks, it might be worth paying heed to the words of C. Wright \nMills (1959: 124), perhaps the most passionate advocate and exponent of the classical social \nscientific method,  \n Every man his own methodologist!  \n Methodologists!

As such, historical sociology is at the heart of what C. Wright Mills (1959) evocatively \ncalls \u2018the sociological imagination\u2019. On the development of historical sociology as a self-\naware body of work, see Abrams (1982), Skocpol (ed.) (1984), Smith (1991), Delanty and \nEgin (eds.) (2003), and Lawson (2005a, chapter 1). On historical sociology in IR, see Hobden \nand Hobson (eds.) (2002).  \n2 Although isolated examples of self-aware HSIR had appeared before this point, most \nnotably in the work of Raymond Aron (1986).  \n3 To some extent, this is a re-orientation towards sociology \u2013 many prominent classical IR \nscholars, including Stanley Hoffman (1960), Hans Morgenthau (1967) and Hedley Bull \n(1969) were scathing in their condemnation of economism. My thanks to Robbie Shilliam for \nmaking this point to me. \n4 This is also a danger for the wider enterprise of historical sociology itself. There is, as far as \nI know, no department of historical sociology anywhere in the world. Rather, the division and \nsubdivision of academic subjects into schools, faculties, departments and disciplines has \nserved to spread historical sociology broadly but not deeply. Without its own institutional \nbase from which to build, what at first appears to be a feast of historical sociology can begin \non closer inspection to look more like a famine.  \n5 \u2018Let the buyer beware\u2019. \n6 This fuzziness can also promote a conservative bias \u2013 the grounds of John Krige\u2019s critique \nof Fayerabend\u2019s philosophy of science. Krige makes the point that, \u2018if \u201canything goes\u201d, then \neverything stays\u2019. \n7 It should be made clear from the outset that this exercise, as Rosenau points out, is \nperformed with the intention of fostering \u2018healthy fervent\u2019 rather than reducing its \nparticipants to \u2018hopeless confusion\u2019. \n8 Illustrative examples of fruitful interdisciplinarity include the concept of \u2018punctuated \nequilibrium\u2019, first mooted by the biologist Stephen Jay Gould to describe the switch-points in \nwhich long periods of stable reproduction within complex systems are punctuated by short, \nperiods of rapid change. Gould\u2019s concept has been usefully transported into numerous \u2018soft\u2019 \nacademic sciences. Another pertinent example is the concept of \u2018path dependence\u2019 which \noriginated in economic history and has become used in many disciplines to describe how \nsmall initial distinctions are amplified over time, becoming substantial schisms which are \nthen difficult to reverse.  \n9 For more on this, see Lawson (2005b) and Hobson (2005). \n10 It is important to note that these categories are proposed as analytical tools rather than as \nconcrete explanatory categories. As such, borders between them should neither be overstated \nnor pushed too hard lest they become artificial, superficial and ultimately, absurd.  \n11 Karl Popper led the twentieth century assault on induction in numerous texts (see, for \nexample 1957). Popper organised a range of figures to join him in this task, including Albert \nEinstein, who was supportive enough to write in a letter to Popper (1962: 492), \u2018theory \ncannot be fabricated out of the results of the observations, but must be invented\u2019. \n12 The debate between the Austrian School and the German Historical School over scientific \nmethod became known as the Methodenstreit. In contrast to the former group, the German \nHistorical School argued that, rather than focusing on universal truisms modelled on homo \neconomicus, the line which was pursued by classical economists, economic processes \noperated within a social framework which was in turn shaped by cultural and historical \nforces. Hence, Gustav Schmoller and his associates favoured historical, comparative research \nthat could uncover the distinctive properties of particular economic systems. The core debates \n \n32 \n                                                                                                                                                       \nof the original Methodenstreit continue to reverberate around contemporary social science: \nthe degree to which people\u2019s actions are shaped by their social, historical and normative \ncontexts as opposed to the view of individuals as universally driven homo politicus or homo \neconomicus; preferences as exogenously generated by social institutions or the endogenous \nresult of primal drives; rationality as a broad category embracing a range of motivations \nversus rationality as a narrow, limited realm of utility maximisation.   \n13 Popper owes this analogy to the German poet, Novalis, \u2018hypothesis are nets: only he who \ncasts will catch\u2019.  \n14 As Stanley Hoffman (1960: 44) warns, many such theories are \u2018a triumph of form over \nsubstance\u2019. \n15 Of course, neorealism does contain a theory of systemic change, much of it originating in \npower transition theory, but only as this is carried through via great power war. On this, see \nOrganski (1968), Organski and Kugler (1980), and Gilpin (1981).  \n16 See, for example, Wohlforth (1994). \n17 On polarity, see Waltz (1979), Gilpin (1981), Walt (1987), Christensen and Snyder (1990), \nLayne (1993), Schweller (1998), Wohlforth (1999), and Waltz (2000); on soft balancing see \nPape (2005), Paul (2005), and Brooks and Wohlforth (2005).  \n18 On neorealist degeneration, see Vasquez (1997); on its progress see Elman (2003). A \nparallel argument is made in Philip Tetlock (2005). Tetlock argues that specialists are \nactually less good at predicting events in their field as non-experts, having a tendency to \nover-extrapolate from the past to the future. This is, in many ways, unsurprising. After all, \nexperts are not neutral observers but partisans who have a vested interest in explaining and \npredicting a certain chain of events. As such, they have an in-built tendency towards \nmotivated bias and groupthink, a point well made thirty years ago by Robert Jervis (1976) \nand more recently by Michael Freeden (2003). For illustrative examples of the struggles of \nsome IR hedgehogs to incorporate unhelpful evidence and to predict major events in world \npolitics, see the article by Robert Kaplan (1994), which predicted the imminent dissolution of \nCanada, and those by John Mearsheimer (1990, 1995) who, following the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, predicted the break-up of the EU and the dissolution of NATO, and advocated \nceding nuclear technology to Germany so that it could act as a deterrent against Soviet \naggression (despite Mearsheimer\u2019s concerns about the potential for a German invasion of \nPoland, and a war between Hungary and Romania).   \n19 On the poverty of the former, see Spruyt (1994); on the latter, see Rosenberg (2005). \n20 Thanks to Justin Rosenberg for clarifying my reading of Giddens on this point. \n21 Of course, induction can never be \u2018pure\u2019 \u2013 even historians work within general (deductive) \ncategories which act as orienting devices for their research. \n22 On causal narratives, see Suganami (1999); on superior stories, see Tilly (2005). \n23 When asked what he considered to be the agents of social change, Braudel is said to have \nreplied: \u2018forests and rivers\u2019. \n24 Thompson (1965: 228) is worth quoting on this issue: \u2018history is not a factory for the \nmanufacture of grand theory, like some Concorde of the open air; nor is it an assembly line of \nthe production of midget theories in series; nor yet is it some gigantic experimental station in \nwhich the theories of foreign manufacturers can be \u201capplied\u201d, \u201ctested\u201d, and \u201cconfirmed\u201d. \nThat is not its business at all. Its business it to recover, to explain and to understand its object: \nreal history\u2019. \n25 For more on this, see Lawson (2005a). \n26 On the benefits and difficulties of applying Lakatosian criteria to social science and, in \nparticular, to IR, see Elman and Elman (eds.) (2003). \n \n33 \n                                                                                                                                                       \n27 But not, of course, outside human agency. Although social structures such as capitalism, \npatriarchy or time appear to exist outside or beyond us, they are nothing more than social \nrelations, formed as concrete historical conjunctures according to a particular time and space \nconstellation. At their heart, therefore, is human agency. A central function of a historical \nsociological research programme is to examine the production, reproduction and, potentially, \nthe transformation of these historical conjunctures.  \n28 For Mann, this is the point in which ideology becomes transcendent (thereby containing the \npossibility of generating a radical alternative order) rather than imminent (concerned with \nlegitimating the existing order). Karl Mannheim (1960) similarly writes that such a moment \nrepresents a potential shift from ideology to utopia.  \n29 An excellent collection of articles on third-wave historical sociology can be found in \nAdams, Clemens and Orloff (eds.) (2005). \n30 For more on these issues, see Mills (1959) and Rosenberg (1994b). \n"}
