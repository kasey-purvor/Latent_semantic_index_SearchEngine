Our results suggest Third World administrative research published in leading \ninternational publications has become a small-scale, disparate, descriptive, qualitative and non-\ncomparative sub-field dominated by Western researchers.   This empirical finding provides a \nplatform from which a vision for public administration as a global social science is articulated \nand advanced. \n 3 \nBiography \n \nNilima Gulrajani is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Government and the \nDevelopment Studies Institute (DESTIN) at the London School of Economics. Her research sits \nat the centre of debates on the organization and management of foreign aid, particularly as relate \nto questions of aid effectiveness. She obtained a PhD in Management Studies from Trinity \nCollege, Cambridge. Before joining the LSE in 2007, she worked at the Canadian Ministry of \nFinance, the Global Economic Governance Programme at the University of Oxford and the \nWorld Bank. \n \nKim Moloney holds a two-year contract a Lecturer in Public Sector Management at the \nUniversity of the West Indies (Kingston, Jamaica). She is also a Ph.D. Candidate in Public \nAdministration at American University in Washington DC where her dissertation focused on the \nbureaucratic politics of the World Bank\u2019s public sector management history from 1983 to 2007. \nShe expects to defend her dissertation in April 2010. Her MPA is from the Maxwell School at \nSyracuse University and she holds an MA in International Relations and Economics from Johns \nHopkins University \n \n \n \n 4 \nGlobalizing Public Administration: Today\u2019s Research and Tomorrow\u2019s \nAgenda \n \nIntroduction \n In a 2008 PA Times article, the President of the American Society of Public \nAdministration (ASPA) hinted that public administration\u2019s future was bound to be a global one \nas commonplace distinctions between foreign and domestic public administration collapsed \nunder global challenges, communication innovations and cross-national interdependencies \n(White, 2008).  Meanwhile, in his first address to a Joint Session of the U.S. Congress in \nFebruary 2009, President Barack Obama identified convergences between American and \ninternational interests because \u201cwe know that America cannot meet the threats of this century \nalone, [and] the world cannot meet them without America.\u201d ii To what extent are claims of \ninterdependency such as these actually breaking down barriers between public administration \nscholarship and the study of Third World public administration? \n This article begins by analyzing research on Third World administrative systemsiii by \nconsidering its status within public administration and by reviewing articles published in leading \nsocial science journals. Via a content analysis, we identify a number of predicaments facing non-\nWestern administration research.  In doing so, we create a platform for articulating and \nadvancing a vision for public administration as a global social science. The first section briefly \ntraces the intellectual evolution of Third World administrative research across comparative \npublic administration, development administration and international public management. Our \nsecond section examines articles on Third World administrative systems published in ten leading \njournals that span these three sub-disciplines.  This analysis reveals that administrative studies of \nthe global South have fractured into a small-scale, disparate, non-cumulative, descriptive and \n 5 \nnon-comparative field dominated by researchers with Northern institutional affiliations. The \nthird section considers why Third World administration finds itself in this weakened state, \narguing its current condition hampers theoretical and methodological development of both Third \nWorld, American and international administrative science. From this analysis, we recommend \nturning public administration into a globally inclusive endeavor in which Third World \nadministrative research can strengthen both American and international public administration.   \nA global public administration can build knowledge cumulatively via collaborative arrangements \nthat collapse geographic, methodological and disciplinary boundaries. It can inform some of the \nmost intractable and disconcerting global challenges that we face today.  Ultimately, global \npublic administration flourishes to the benefit of American public administration, Third World \nadministration and the world at large. \n \nThe scholarship of Third World administration  \n The intellectual history of Third World public administration crosses both epochs and \ndisciplines.  It begins in the early days of the post-independence era, when fledgling \ngovernments in Asia and Africa re-structured newly sovereign administrative environments.  \nAgainst this backdrop, comparative public administration (CPA) established itself as a sizable, \nidentifiable and complex contemporary movement, a branch of public administration focused \nupon the comparative analysis of administrative processes and institutions (Guess & Gabriellyan, \n2007; Heady,Perlman & Rivera, 2007; Otenyo & Lind, 2006b; Raphaeli, 1967).  The \nestablishment of the Comparative Administration Group (CAG) within the American Society for \nPublic Administration (ASPA) in 1960 had as its \u201coverriding interest\u201d the  \u201cadministrative \nproblems of the \u2018developing\u2019 countries\u201d (Riggs, 1970).  Financial assistance provided by the \n 6 \nFord Foundation to CAG further cemented an association between CPA and Third World \nadministration (Jreisat, 2005; Otenyo & Lind, 2006b; Van Wart & Cayer, 1990). In parallel, the \nother branches of public administration scholarship retained their focus on American problems \nfor which American solutions were sought (Heady,Perlman & Rivera, 2007: 607; Otenyo & \nLind, 2006a: 2).   In a sense, the late 1960s and early 1970s marked the pinnacle for comparative \npublic administration as the field grew in numbers, funding and academic prestige (Van Wart & \nCayer, 1990: 239).  \nExtending the traditional bureaucratic model of public administration in the United States \nto other nations became an early purpose of development administration (Hughes, 2003: 225; \nTurner & Hulme, 1997: 12).   Fred W. Riggs offered two early meanings for development \nadministration: (1) the administration of development programmes and methods to implement \npolicies and plans to meet development objectives and (2) the development of administration as \nstrengthening administrative capabilities (Riggs, 1970).  From an early date, development \nadministration was largely an applied offshoot of comparative public administration \n(Brinkerhoff, 2008). Its objectives moved beyond altruistic development, including revolution \nand modernization (Guess & Gabriellyan, 2007). In Britain, initial suspicions of development \nadministration as a veiled attack on the colonial record gradually gave way to an applied vision \nof training overseas administrators through pragmatic, experience-based curricula (Clarke, 1999; \nSchaffer, 1969).  Development administration gradually carved a distinct identity from \ncomparative public administration, for example as a valued subject in British development \nstudies programs and facultiesiv or a task for applied policy research institutes. \n The mediocre economic success of developing states, the failures to analytically predict \nadministrative reform outcomes and the rise of authoritarian regimes in many parts of Africa and \n 7 \nLatin America contributed to a general disillusionment with the study of Third World \nadministration (Hirschmann, 1981; Schaffer, 1969; Van Wart & Cayer, 1990). This poor \nperformance in the Third World was partly to blame for the growing uncertainty around CPA\u2019s \nviability as a sub-discipline from the mid 1970s onwards (Otenyo & Lind, 2006a; Peters, 1994; \nSigelman, 1976 ).  Other contributing factors included its ambiguous identity as both an applied \nand academic science (Jreisat, 2005; Otenyo & Lind, 2006a); its predilection for grand abstract \ntheories with little bearing on or relevance in reality (Heady,Perlman & Rivera, 2007); and \nconceptual fragmentation and dispersion relating to levels, units of analysis and dependent \nvariables (Jreisat, 1991, 2005; Peters, 1994). All of this resulted in the \u201cbubble\u201d of interest in \ncomparative public administration \u201cburst[ing] as rapidly as it had formed\u201d (Van Wart & Cayer, \n1990: 239).   \n Comparative public administration\u2019s status as sub-discipline of public administration is \nan issue of perennial contestation. Since the early 1970s, there has been a separate and \nautonomous evolution of Third World administration research away from mainstream American \npublic administration towards other social science disciplines like political science, sociology \nand economics (Jreisat, 2005: 234). Perhaps the most prolific of these disciplinary invasions has \ncome from neo-institutional economics, where formal and informal rules and incentives are \nexamined at the expense of actual micro-level behavior (Clague, 1997; North, 1995). These \ndisciplinary assumptions of bureaucratic life have misunderstood Waldonian assumptions of \nAmerican public administration or at best, have depoliticized Third World administration by \nturning it into a shadow of its former self. \n Nevertheless, there is a new wave of optimism about the state of comparative public \nadministration, and particularly Third World administrative research. Whether for better or for \n 8 \nworse, this re-emergence is almost certainly tied to the influence of a \u201cnew\u201d public management \n(NPM) agenda within public administration (Hood, 1991; Kaboulian, 1998; Kettl, 1997). NPM \nhas thrown up analytical and inter-disciplinary issues relating to foreign administration by \nfostering interest in new subjects like governance, outsourcing, contracting, performance \nmanagement and accountability (Brinkerhoff, 2008; Brinkerhoff & Coston, 1999; \nHeady,Perlman & Rivera, 2007). Meanwhile, international actors like the World Bank and the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) seek greater analytical \nclarity on the ways to enhance capabilities of the Third World administrative state (Grindle, \n1997; Sahlin-Andersson, 2001; World Bank, 1997).   \n The influence of public management on Third World administration is also witnessed in a \nchanging vocabulary. The term development administration has been replaced with the label \n\u2018international development management\u2019 or simply \u2018development management\u2019. v  Development \nmanagement understands the state in the context of its relationships to non-state actors, including \nthe private sector, non-governmental organizations and hybrid organizations like social \nenterprises (Brinkerhoff, 2008; Guess & Gabriellyan, 2007: 571; Hughes, 2003; Turner & \nHulme, 1997). The development management revolution nevertheless stands somewhat \nseparately from the discipline of comparative public administration, perhaps because \ndevelopment management has also found new territories of inquiry, including the study of \ninternational aid actors and instruments. Development management is perhaps becoming more of \na feature of inter-disciplinary curricula in master\u2019s degree programs in public policy, security \nstudies, international development, and than it is a feature of schools of public administration and \npublic management. \n 9 \n The implications of this migration for the study of Third World administration in \nparticular remain un-investigated. What has been the nature of recent research exploring Third \nworld administrative systems given these shifts and trends? If we believe that public \nadministration scholarship can and should improve the lives of those in poor nations and advance \nthe twin aims of security and peace (Brinkerhoff & Brinkerhoff, forthcoming), there is value in \nknowing, rather than simply presuming, that a robust and rich science of Third World \nadministration actually exists. \n \nExamining Third World Administrative Studies: A Content Analysis \n \n An exploration of the contemporary status of Third World public administration requires \nsome empirical study of its published outputs. Nevertheless, the evolution of Third World \nadministrative studies described above suggests that any endeavor to understand the state of play \nin Third World administration must by definition look beyond the sub-field of comparative \npublic administration.  As such, we conducted a content analysis of leading social science \npublications that represent the three sub-disciplines associated with Third World administration \n(comparative public administration, development administration and public management). A key \nassumption of this study is that the highest quality research on Third World administration is \npublished in top-rated journals representing these three social science sub-fields.  While \nacknowledging that drawing from leading journals limits the sample to English language \npublications published mainly in North America and Europe, this also represents Third World \nadministrative research achieving the highest levels of international social science excellence.  \nWhile we recognize that by drawing the circle tightly we do not include an assessment of many \nnational journals published in languages other than English, where studies of developing country \n 10 \nadministrations are likely to feature prominently, surveying these journals would have also been \nproblematic due to access and language difficulties. \n We undertake this empirical analysis by modeling our literature review on previous \nsurveys of comparative public administration published in Public Administration Review \n(Sigelman, 1976 ; Van Wart & Cayer, 1990).vi Sigelman (1976) undertook a content-analysis of \nfull-length articles appearing in the discontinued Journal of Comparative Administration \nbetween 1969 and 1974 and concluded that the field of comparative public administration had \nnot benefited from the interaction of theory and data, opting instead for grand abstract deductive \ntheorizing that resulted in a vicious cycle of academic under-development. A subsequent review \nby Van Wart and Cayer (1990) involved a content analysis covering 20 journals spanning \ncomparative and development administration articles published between 1982 and 1986.  Their \nresults also suggested that comparative administration research was a discipline that largely \nrelied on description and avoided theory testing.  Interestingly, the findings of both surveys \nechoed the conclusions of content analysis conducted of public administration more generally \n(Houston & Delevan, 1990; Lan & Anders, 2000). \n In this analysis, ten journals representing key publication outlets for Third World \nadministration were selected.   Given existing citation databases do not rank journals on the basis \nof the sub-disciplinary categories of interest here, and moreover given to the best of our \nknowledge no similar study of Third World administration has ever been undertaken, the sample \nof journals was selected in two main ways.  First, we drew on the journals used in Van Wart and \nCayer (1990) that had high international content and represented comparative and development \nadministration.  And secondly, these journals are informally recognized as providing important \ncontemporary outlets for Third World administrative studies in all three sub-disciplines.  For the \n 11 \ncomparative public administration journals, we chose the journals that Van Wart and Cayer \n(1990) identified as publishing the highest frequency of comparative public administration \nresearch (International Review of Administrative Sciences, Public Administration,  International \nJournal of Public Administration, Public Administration Review). In international development, \nfour development journals were selected; two drawn from Van Wart and Cayer\u2019s original sample \n(Development and Change and Journal of Developing Areas) and two highly reputed outlets for \ndeveloping country research excluded from their study (Public Administration and Development \nand World Development). Finally, we examined only two public management journals \n(Governance and International Public Management Journal), limiting our choice to only two \nbecause of their reputation and international orientation. \n Our non-probabilistic sample of Third World administrative articles was selected from \nevery third volume of the ten journals starting in 1996.vii  All full-length research articlesviii \njournal issues published in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008ix were inspected.  Unlike the two \nearlier surveys of comparative public administration, we chose a periodic rather than continuous \nlongitudinal examination of our selected journals in order to capture a time interval exceeding \nfive years.   To be chosen, articles had to deal with the empirical realities of administrative \nsystems in a developing country or a set of countries. The term administrative systems was \nunderstood as any arena of public sector decision-making, including bureaucracies, legislatures, \npolitical parties, public corporations and courts (Riggs, 1970: 21). We then selected articles that \nsubstantially focused on an embedded setting of public administration, excluding conceptual \nand\/or commentary-based pieces that lacked such an empirical focus. To qualify as a developing \ncountry, the countries examined had to be one of the 142 eligible recipients of World Bank \nconcessional and non-concessional financing.x  \n 12 \n Using these criteria, our sample included 295 articles concerned with Third World \nadministration from a population of 2049 articles (Table 1). Articles concerning the \nadministrative systems of developing countries thus comprised only 14.0% of the sample, \nsuggesting research on developing country administration remains a relatively small-scale affair \nin the leading publications of comparative public administration, development administration \nand public management. Only in Public Administration and Development (PA & D) did Third \nWorld administration constitute a majority of published articles in the time period examined. If \nwe exclude PA & D, just 10.4% of the sample focused on Third World administration.  Public \nAdministration Review (PAR) has not been a key outlet for empirical research on Third World \nadministration even though it serves as an important outlet for comparative public administration \nresearch more generally.  While this result may be understood by the fact that PAR serves as the \nflagship journal of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA), it is also somewhat \nsurprising given the introductory quote by the former President of ASPA as well as PAR\u2019s \ncommitment to international and comparative public administration.xi \n Six questions guided the content analysis of our sample. These questions targeted \nspecific dimension of Third World administrative research, as well as paralleled previous \nsurveys of comparative public administration and public administration more generally.  The \nfirst dimension of interest involved an assessment of the geographic and thematic loci of the \narticles.  Secondly, information on the theoretical\/conceptual standard adopted in the sample data \nwas sought.  Next, the kinds of methods availed of in the empirical study conducted was subject \nto examination.  We then explored whether these articles adopted a comparative approach to \ntheir examination of Third World administration.  And finally, we asked whether these studies \nwere engaging researchers located in the Third World to any significant degree.   As per the \n 13 \nmethods adopted in previous reviews by Lan and Anders (2000), Houston and Delevan (1990), \nVan Wart and Cayer (1990) and Sigelman (1976), the title, author information, abstract and \nprimary research question of all the articles in the sample were reviewed. Where this still did not \nreveal sufficient information to answer the questions of interest, the entire article was read.   \nBelow we discuss the approaches we took to investigating each dimension and present our \nfindings.   \n \n (1) Is research focused on a small set of geographic locations and topics?  \n Sigelman (1976) argued that established fields of study ought to be focused on a small set \nof common issues. This logic is applicable to geographic and research foci in developing country \nadministrative studies. To assess geographic focus, we coded all articles according to the \ndeveloping country discussed using the World Bank classification scheme. Out of a possible 142 \ndeveloping countries, our sample of 295 articles dealt with 90 developing countries. Fifty-two \npapers were oriented toward regional groups that included a developing country region (e.g. \nAfrica, colonial countries, failed states, Eastern Europe, post-tsunami countries, etc.)  This \nsuggests a tremendous dispersion of countries examined.  Excluding regional studies, an average \nof only 2.7 articles concentrated on any given country. While there is some concentration in the \nemerging markets of Brazil, India, South Africa and China (Table 2), there is a vast geographic \narea covered within Third World administrative scholarship.  With the exception of the ten \ncountries listed in Table 2, there is a relatively small frequency of articles for the remaining 80 \ndeveloping countries (ie where the article frequency is fewer than 8).   This is suggestive of \nlimited concentrated and cumulative knowledge generation of administrative processes in most \nof the developing world.  While a closer reading of the specific articles relating to each \n 14 \ndeveloping country could confirm this claim, this lack of country-based concentration is \ntentatively indicative of the limited depth to Third World administrative scholarship. \n To assess topical research focus in the sub-field of Third World administration, we chose \nto code articles on the basis of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) section \ncategories. The reason for this choice is that the ASPA sections list provides established \ncategories of key subject groupings within public administration beyond the United States and \nthus provides a high degree of face validity as proxies for major research areas within public \nadministration.xii  While this coding may suffer from construct validity problems, this is no less \nthe case in previous attempts to code articles by subject areas (For example, see Lan and Anders \n2000).  If more than one thematic area applied to an article, the dominant theme was coded while \nif no code seemed applicable, we indicated as much (Table 3).  \n Our results show that the topics treated by Third World administration research do not \nneatly fit within standard thematic areas of American public administration scholarship, as 30% \nof all articles could not be classified using the ASPA section categorizations. Instead, examined \ntopics often dealt with issues specific to Third World problems, for example food policy, post-\nconflict themes, human rights administration, studies of authoritarian transitions, etc. While we \ncannot necessarily conclude that Third World administrative research is more or less diverse than \npublic administration at large, we can state that relevant topics and themes for Third World \nadministrative study do seem to be distinct.  \n Our results also suggest there may be no single prioritized \u201csector\u201d in Third World \nadministration, with perhaps the exception of environmental and natural resource management \n(in the area of water resources and forest management especially). In World Development and \nJournal of Developing Areas in particular, the state is most often discussed in the context of its \n 15 \npublic budgeting and financial management functions. This is natural given those journals orient \nthemselves to economic topics like public expenditure management, liberalization, industrial \npolicy and growth. We also found that public law and administration (in the context of \ncorruption and post-conflict reconstruction) remain recurrent themes. The variety of themes and \nthe lack of topical concentration suggest significant width, but limited depth within Third World \nadministration research.  Overall, these results tentatively indicate that the identity of Third \nWorld administration is a disparate one, both geographically and thematically. \n \n(2) What kinds of theories are used?  \n Many reviews of comparative public administration have pointed out that a shift from \nideographic (distinct cases) to nomothetic approaches (studies that seek explicitly to formulate \nand test propositions) is one vehicle for improving comparativist scholarship (Jreisat, 2005: 237; \nRiggs, 1991: 473). To determine if a rigorous theoretical-conceptual standard in our sample is \nutilized, each article was coded as having one of three \u201cstyles\u201d as per Van Wart and Cayer \n(1990). One category included a \u201cdescriptive\u201d style of a particular empirical reality. A \u201cthesis \nassertion\u201d category offered a well-articulated statement or proposition around which data and \narguments were structured, while a \u201chypothesis or model testing\u201d category required hypotheses \nor relationships to be identified prior to data gathering in order to test theoretical assertions. \n Our results in Table 4 indicate that 53.9% of the sample falls within the \u201cdescriptive\u201d \ncategory with \u201cthesis assertion\u201d not too far behind at 34.9%. Hypothesis testing only comprised \n11.2% of all articles.  This suggests there is more description and less thesis assertion than in the \ncase of comparative public administration broadly defined two decades earlier (Van Wart & \nCayer, 1990).  It also parallels the findings of those who claim public administration research is \n 16 \nengaged in little theory testing (Houston & Delevan, 1990).  Similarly, it appears Third World \nadministrative studies has not sufficiently developed explanatory theories or even worked \ntowards developing such theories that can account for changing properties and problems in \nadministration. The comparison with comparative public administration, as well as public \nadministration more generally, may be relevant here as the slow scientific development of both \nfields is attributed to their practical orientations and concerns (Guess & Gabriellyan, 2007; \nHeady,Perlman & Rivera, 2007; Houston & Delevan, 1990: 679).       \n \n(3) What methods are used? \n Following Sigelman (1976) and Van Wart and Cayer (1990), we ask whether our \nadministrative studies relied on systematic modes of analysis. Are the modes of analysis essay-\nbased, including broad theoretical and conceptual pieces? Are they empirical non-quantitative, \nincluding narrow empirical studies (mainly case studies) that do not employ quantitative \ntechniques? Or are they empirical quantitative including (a) studies that employed only simple \ncounting or percentizing techniques which Sigelman (1976) identified as \u201clow level\u201d or (b) \nstudies that used more than nominal measurements including tests of significance (designated \n\u201cmore powerful\u201d)?  \n Our results in Table 5 indicate that 11.5% of articles adopted powerful high-level \nquantitative methods and 17.0% of the lower-level quantitative techniques. Most articles fell \nwithin either broad essay or summary pieces (38.3%) or those using empirical non-quantitative \ntechniques (33.2%).  The imbalance between quantitative and qualitative methods is striking.  \nAlthough this result matches the results of earlier surveys of comparative public administration, \nit does not parallel the field of public administration more broadly where a more even split \n 17 \nbetween qualitative and quantitative research methods has been found to exist (Lan and Anders \n2000: 150; Houston and Delevan 1990: 670).  This is not to claim the superiority of quantitative \nmethods.  Rather, there is a danger that with such a low uptake of quantitative methods, Third \nWorld administration may suffer from a case of \u201cbarefoot empiricism\u201d that precludes its overall \nscientific development (Jreisat, 2005; Peters, 1994).   \n \n(4) Is an explicitly comparative lens adopted? \n The \u201cdangers\u201d that lurk within the single case study include implicitly assuming each \ncase is \u201ceither so particular that no others need be compared, or is so general that all others are \nlike it\u201d (Peters, 1994: 83).  Peters argues American researchers tend to assume particularity for \nother countries and generality for the United States.  Comparative analysis can guard against \nsuch unsubstantiated assumptions by increasing the likelihood of dependable results, enhancing \nthe evaluation of hypotheses and encouraging stronger verification of conclusions (Dahl, 1947; \nJreisat, 2005: 239; Riggs, 1991).  Nevertheless, identifying what constitutes comparative \nresearch is sometimes tricky.  We adopted three categories to assess comparison, inspired by Van \nWart and Cayer (1990): (1) single case studies that did not compare; (2) single cases that \ninvolved internal comparison, for example if sub-national or cross-sectional comparisons were \ndrawn or if hypothesis-testing used longitudinal data; and (3) multiple country studies that are by \ndefinition comparative.  \n Somewhat \u201cdangerously,\u201d we find that 54.2% of our articles are single case studies with \nno comparisons attempted (Table 6). Multiple country case studies constitute approximately \n26.1% of all articles and single case studies with some internal comparative element comprise \n19.7% of our sample. The finding that most published Third World administration research is \n 18 \nnon-comparative parallels the finding by Van Wart and Cayer, where two-thirds of all \ncomparative public administration published between 1982 and 1986 were single case studies.  \nThis tendency to refrain from comparative analysis, coupled with the dominance of descriptive \napproaches and essay-based methods as underlined previously, suggests the possibility for \ngeneralizability in Third World administration remains constrained.  \n \n(5) Where are authors located? \n Our content analysis also explored whether authors were affiliated with universities and \nresearch institutions in the global South. This approach differs from existing surveys of public \nadministration that have concentrated on authors\u2019 university faculty, departmental affiliation and \nlevel of academic rank (Houston & Delevan, 1990; Lan & Anders, 2000).  Nevertheless, in the \ncontext of understanding the extent to which Third World scholarship is actually strengthening \nscholarly knowledge in the Third World, we chose to concentrate on the location of affiliations \nof the authors.  Understanding whether internationally recognized research is being undertaken \nby researchers located in the developing world or still remains the domain of those trained and \nfinanced in the North can help us understand if top-rated administrative science of the \ndeveloping world is increasingly situated in developing countries. This is important as we \nconsider whether cutting edge research on Third World administration is a truly global endeavor \nthat has potential positive externalities and contributions for educational establishments in the \nglobal South, or whether the field is still defined and constituted by those trained and\/or \nemployed in the North.  We chose to use the location of the institutional affiliation of the author \nrather than an author\u2019s nationality given many developing country nationals train and secure \nacademic employment in North America, Europe and the Antipodes.  While these academics \n 19 \nmay contribute to social science, including Third World administrative science, at the highest \nlevels, they may also inadvertently exacerbate a brain drain from South to North that undermines \ncapacity-building and local knowledge development in national administrative systems.  \n  To examine author affiliation systematically, we developed a coding system in which \narticles where all authors were affiliated with non-Western institutions at the time of writing \nreceived 3 points. Where half or the majority of authors were affiliated with Third World \ninstitutions, we allocated 2 points, while if a minority of authors claimed such affiliations, 1 \npoint was awarded. If no author cites institutional affiliations located in the Third World, we \nallocated no points. For this analysis, we disregarded the 22 articles where institutional \naffiliations were impossible to discern due to journal formatting.  \nIn our sample, 69.6% of articles do not have a single author affiliated with a developing \ncountry institute or universities, indicating that authors located in West are more prolific in \nleading academic journals.   Surprisingly however, in 19.4% of our sample all authors are \naffiliated with organizations located in the Third World.  Interestingly, collaborations between \ndeveloped and developing country researchers remain extremely rare; only 3.6% of articles have \nminorities of developing country authors while 7.3% have half or a majority of authors from the \ndeveloping world.  \n  \n Overall, this content analysis indicates that Third World administrative study is a small-\nscale, disparate, descriptive, qualitative\/empirical, non-comparative and predominantly Western-\ncentered activity that limits our ability to build a cumulative body of social science research. The \nstudy of Third World administration remains in almost all cases a minority of published articles \nwithin leading public administration journals, development journals and public management \n 20 \njournals. Most published research across the three fields falls within the descriptive category, \nwith those having well articulated statements and theoretical propositions are a distinct minority \nof studies. Methods used are largely qualitative and essay-based, with quantitative studies of \nboth the low and high strength variety still limited. Research was infrequently comparative, with \nmost research designs utilizing single case studies. Finally, a growing but nonetheless small \nminority of articles had authors with institutional affiliations in the global South, suggesting that \ninternationally recognized Third World administrative study largely occurs by researchers \nlocated outside the Third World.  \n \nWhy is Third World research in this state? \n \n Why do the highest levels of scientific knowledge of Third World administration in the \ncontemporary period exhibit the characteristics of a small-scale, descriptive, \nqualitative\/empirical and non-comparative sub-field dominated by researchers with Western \naffiliations? We offer three possible reasons that may explain these findings.   \n First, the perennial insecurity of comparative research within the parent discipline of \npublic administration keeps Third World administrative studies as a minor sub-interest within \npublic administration. In the United States, this is partly a consequence of the politics of \nknowledge within graduate schools of public administration. Comparative and development \nadministration courses remain electives on most US graduate programs if they exist at all, while \ncore courses concentrate on American subjects with little examination of international \nphenomenon (Farazmand, 1996: 253; Heady, 2001: 393).  While the host nation of any education \nprogram should rightly be the country of focus for training, American students risk being under-\n 21 \nexposed to international phenomenon when compared to their counterparts located elsewhere in \nthe world (Heady, 2001:393). This may create an assumption among future public administration \nscholars that the problems of the world are unimportant, are equivalent to those in America, \nand\/or at least reflective of the American experience, without treating any of this as a matter for \nfurther investigation. The study of foreign administration thus remains a luxury rather than \nnecessity, an intellectual indulgence or altruistic act (when directed towards the Third World, for \nexample) rather than an intrinsic part of building a more accurate understanding of American \npublic administration. Moreover, until comparative public administration can significantly \ninform mainstream American public administration, there is a sense that Third World \nadministration will never gain the global and scientific acceptance that it strives for (Riggs, \n1991: 475).  \n Secondly, with comparative public administration relegated to a secondary status within \npublic administration, research of \u201cforeign\u201d administrations have been either kept distant from \nmainstream public administration or migrated to disciplines more welcoming to their interests \n(Jreisat, 2005: 234). Multi-disciplinary interest in Third World administration has further \nfragmented research geographically, conceptually and methodologically.   If anything unites \nThird World administrative studies, it has been its ability to capture the \u201clocal realities\u201d of \nadministration in full contextual specificity. With methods of comparison generally absent and \nlittle attempt to build coherent and cumulative literatures across topics or geographies, the ability \nto generalize from this local context to other locations and conditions and\/or develop monothetic \ntheories, whether in the developed or developing world, remains unviable. \n Lastly, to make sense of the limited presence of Third World administrative content in \nleading publication outlets, as well as the paucity of authors with affiliations to Third World \n 22 \ninstitutions, one must ask if such research confronts institutional obstacles. Currently, leading \njournals are published in English, mainly in the US and UK, and constituted by editorial boards \nmade up of scholars trained in Western academic canons and traditions. Researchers affiliated \nwith institutes in the developing world are less likely to have been educated abroad, and will \ntherefore be less aware of Northern academic protocols, less familiar with Western theories, \nempirical traditions and the English language and less frequently immersed in key networks of \nassociation and influence.  Without such kinds of experience and socialization, publishing in \nhighly rated academic journals can be a real challenge. In some part, the obstacle for Third \nWorld scholars is a problem of financing as ensuring that new Third World scholars can compete \nwith Western-educated graduates requires investments in local research environments and higher \neducational establishments.  Similarly, the demands of teaching in many developing countries \ncan also severely limit the time available for research.  In other instances however, there are real \ndifficulties in changing parochial interests that keep the study of developing country \nadministrations strictly within domestic boundaries, national languages and local journals.  \nOverall then, the challenge of publication for scholars of public administration might therefore \nbe described as systemic, financial and cultural.  \n \nTowards a global public administration  \n \n In the face of these difficulties and trends, the search for a robust science of \ncontemporary Third World administration continues. As we consider the future of public \nadministration, we guard against what Ferrel Heady described as both the hubris of making \n\u201cringing pronouncements about a new paradigm for the field of public administration\u201d and the \n 23 \npessimism of \u201cconclu[ding] that we have reached a state of decline or decadence requiring \nrevolutionary efforts to rescue us from irrelevance\u201d (Heady, 2001: 392) \n This content analysis underlines the need to end the false dichotomy that separates and \ndivides Third World administrative scholarship from other areas of administrative scholarship \n(Farazmand, 1996, 1999; Heady, 2001; Riggs, 1991).  Ending this dichotomy requires \nmainstreaming the study of developing countries within public administration scholarship at the \nsame time as public administration perspectives are better integrated with other social science \ndisciplines with interests in the developing world. The term \u201cglobal public administration\u201d \ncaptures the need to collapse the disciplinary distinctions that restricts cumulative scientific \nengagement on Third World administration. The \u201cglobal\u201d label also highlights that globalization \ndrives the changing character of the modern state in such a way that it requires inclusive \ninternational collaboration when examining any administration, Third World or otherwise \n(Farazmand, 1996, 1999). A \u201cglobal\u201d designation seems especially relevant today given the non-\ncumulative, non-collaborative and geographically circumscribed nature of Third World \nadministrative studies.  \n So what would a global public administration look like?  Its foremost aim would be to \nfoster collaborative research organized around geographies, units of analysis, instruments, \nmethodologies or substantive issues transcending vested disciplinary and national interests.  This \ncould build a rigorous administrative science that has the potential for generalizing \ninternationally without losing hold of its empirical foundations (Jreisat, 2005: 238; Peters, 1994: \n87). Fostering greater collaboration between researchers located in the North and South could be \none tangible step in this direction. As in the case of law where case specifics are interpreted \nthrough larger principles and frameworks, so too can the administrative sciences only become a \n 24 \nuniversal science by \u201cgoing global.\u201d While access to robust data from developing countries may \nbe a continuing challenge, a global public administration will adopt innovative strategies to \novercome such challenges.  This includes building datasets that permit comparative global \nanalysis, thereby challenging the monopoly (and perhaps even the biases) of the World Bank and \nother international organizations over Third World administrative data. Global public \nadministration would ultimately become a cumulative and collaborative social science enterprise, \nlinking theory, methods and data in robust and defensible ways.  \n  A global public administration is important to the extent that we strive to ensure security, \npeace and livelihoods in an increasingly inter-connected world.  Potentially relevant topics that \ncould benefit the Third World directly include research on essential public service delivery; \nexploring the politics-administration nexus in developing countries that impedes good \ngovernance; examining the science of state-building in failed and fragile states; considering the \nadministrative backdrop for protecting human rights; or investigating ways administration \nimpedes the trans-national supply of global health and climate change.  The list of topics that \ncurrently do not feature in public administration but nevertheless exhibits tremendous potential \nto dramatically improve the lives of millions is a very long one.  At the same time, a global \npublic administration can also potentially exploit these new vistas to inform the core concerns of \npublic administration scholarship today, including areas like emergency and crisis management, \ncriminal justice, public performance management, ethics, health and human services \nadministration and science and technology to name but a few. \n In conclusion, a global public administration offers opportunities for clearer \nunderstandings of the strengths and weaknesses of administrative systems, process and \ninstruments the world over.  A more inclusive and robust scholarship can encourage a wider \n 25 \narray of solutions for the administrative challenges that hinder prosperity, security, service \nprovision and human rights in any country. A global public administration is an enterprise from \nwhich American public administration, Third World administration and most importantly, the \nworld at large, all stand to benefit.  \n 26 \nBibliography \n \nBrinkerhoff, D.

We do not use the label \u201cThird World\u201d of \n\u201cdeveloping\u201d in any pejorative sense. We include both developing and post-Communist transition countries in this \ndesignation.  \niv For example, Birmingham University\u2019s Development Administration Group was formed in 1968, while \nManchester\u2019s Institute for Development Policy and Management was set up in 1958. \nv It should be acknowledged that for many critical European scholars differences in terminology simply indicates the \nrise of neo-liberal logics in Third World administration, first with neoclassical economics in the 1980s and new \ninstitutional economics in the 1990s (Cooke, 2004; Cooke & Dar, 2008; Hughes, 2003). The debate has ultimately \npitted European radical scholars and North American reformist scholars of development management against one \nanother (Gulrajani, forthcoming).  \nvi A number of essay-based articles have also attempted to explore the state of comparative public administration \n(Farazmand, 1991; Heady,Perlman & Rivera, 2007; Jreisat, 2005; Waldo, 1976).  \nvii Exceptions included the International Journal of Public Administration where we were unable to access the 1996 \nand 1999 volumes and the International Public Management Journal that only began publishing in 1997.  \nviii Book reviews, editorial introductions and in memoriam pieces were disregarded. \nix We missed three issues due to lack of online and hardcopy access in two university libraries. This included \nInternational Journal of Public Administration 2008 31(12) and Journal of Developing Areas 2002 35(2) and 1999 \n32(3).  \nxA full list of these countries can be found at: \nhttp:\/\/web.worldbank.org\/WBSITE\/EXTERNAL\/DATASTATISTICS\/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:6413315\n0~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html#IDA \nxi For a statement of this commitment, see http:\/\/www.aspanet.org\/scriptcontent\/index_par_philosophy.cfm \n(Accessed February 18, 2010) \nxii We excluded the Section of International and Comparative Administration (SICA) since we are exploring the \nadministrative study of developing countries that have largely dominated SICA\u2019s research agenda. We also excluded \nthe Section on Chinese Administration given it is a geographically circumscribed group; the Conference on Minority \nAdministration given this does not have section-status; the Section on Historical, Artistic and Reflective Expression \ngiven it represents a method of studying administration rather than a topic; and the Certified Public Management as \nit seems to be largely an applied category. \n \n"}
