R. Pennington\nInstitute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, Durham University, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom\n(Received 25 April 2006; published 6 July 2006)\nThere has long been speculation about the nature of the \u0001 resonance. For three decades Jaffe has argued\nfor a tetraquark composition, while others have claimed it is largely a glueball. A key pointer to its nature\nis its coupling to two photons. Consequently, there have been recent proposals to observe this important\nscalar hiding in \u0002\u0002 ! \u00030\u00030. We show here that the \u0001 is already crouching in this cross section exactly as\nmeasured 20 years ago. What is new is that precise knowledge of the position of the \u0001 pole, provided by\nthe analysis of the Roy equations, now allows its two photon coupling to be accurately fixed. Its two\nphoton width is found to be \u00014:1\u0002 0:3\u0003 keV, a value far too large for a wholly gluonic, or even a\ntetraquark, state.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.97.011601 PACS numbers: 11.55.Fv, 11.80.Et, 13.40.\u0004f, 13.75.Lb\nNew information on the \u0001.\u2014The \u0001 resonance has for\nlong been a mnemonic for the highly correlated two pion\nexchange that generates the longest range isoscalar force\nrevealed in nuclear binding. It is also the name of the scalar\nfield, the nonzero vacuum expectation value of which\nbreaks chiral symmetry, giving mass to all light hadrons\n[1]. While isoscalar \u0003\u0003 interactions grow rapidly above\nthreshold, they have none of the features readily identified\nas a textbook resonance, quite unlike the \u0004 for instance. If\n\u0003\u0003 mass distributions, whether from classic meson-meson\nreactions or from final state interactions of decay products,\nare fitted with Breit-Wigner forms, then inevitably one\nfinds a pole in the complex energy plane. However, fits\ngive a position varying wildly from one analysis to another\nwith both masses and widths from 350 MeV to 1 GeV\n[2,3].\nRenewed interest in using the Roy equations, which\nencode the analyticity provable in axiomatic field theory\nwith the three channel crossing symmetry of \u0003\u0003 scatter-\ning, has, when combined with chiral constraints and new\nexperimental information, allowed a narrow corridor of\npossible amplitudes from 800 MeV down to threshold, as\nfound by Colangelo, Gasser, and Leutwyler [4]. Recent\nrecognition that the Roy equations can be evaluated not\njust on the real axis but in the complex energy plane has\ndetermined the position of the lightest resonance in QCD,\nthe \u0001, to be at ER \u0005 441\u0004 i272 MeV within small un-\ncertainties [5]. But what is the nature of this state in the\nspectrum of hadrons? Is it a conventional \u0001qq state of the\nquark model [6]? Is it a tetraquark meson [7], composed of\nqqqq, with the expected \u0001qq nonet still higher in mass [8,9],\nor is it largely glue [10,11]? The coupling to photons is a\nkey guide to a state\u2019s composition.\nNow the same precise information on \u0003\u0003 amplitudes\nthat determines the existence and the position of the pole\nallows the amplitude for \u0002\u0002! \u0003\u0003 to be accurately deter-\nmined. Exploiting this is most readily done by the use of\npartial wave dispersion relations. While the \u0001 appears in\nthe I \u0005 0 channel, we will also need the I \u0005 2 amplitude.\nThe calculation follows the philosophy of [12,13].\nTwo photon amplitude.\u2014Let us begin by considering the\nS-wave \u0002\u0002! \u0003\u0003 amplitudes with isospin I, F I\u0001s\u0003, where\ns is the square of the \u0003\u0003 invariant mass. Each of these\namplitudes, with I \u0005 0, 2, being complex has a phase\n\u0005I\u0001s\u0003 along the right-hand cut, when s is above the two\npion threshold, i.e., s > sth \u0005 4m2\u0003. Unitarity, through\nWatson\u2019s theorem, requires the phase of each of these\npartial waves to be the same as the phase of the corre-\nsponding \u0003\u0003 partial wave amplitude in the elastic region\n[14]. To implement this constraint we define the Omne`s\nfunction, \u0002I\u0001s\u0003,\n \u0002I\u0001s\u0003 \u0005 exp\n\u0001\ns\n\u0003\nZ 1\nsth\nds0\n\u0005I\u0001s0\u0003\ns0\u0001s0 \u0004 s\u0003\n\u0002\n; (1)\nwhich by construction has phase\u0005I\u0001s\u0003 for s > sth. Thus the\n\u0002\u0002! \u0003\u0003 S-wave amplitudes, F I\u0001s\u0003, can be written as\nPI\u0001s\u0003\u0002I\u0001s\u0003, where PI\u0001s\u0003 is a function which is real along\nthe right-hand cut with s > sth. The phase,\u0005I, is simply the\nphase shift in the region of elastic unitarity [14], which\napplies up to \u0001KK threshold, since multipion channels are\nnegligible below 1.2 GeV. Moreover, in the low energy\nregion of interest, the differences in phase above 1 GeV\naffect the results little as has been checked by replacing the\n\u0003\u0003! \u0003\u0003 phase with that for \u0003\u0003! \u0001KK. Such a change\nis equivalent to assuming that the \u0003\u0003 final state in the two\nphoton process is only accessed through a \u0001KK intermediate\nstate. Outside the narrow confines of the f0\u0001980\u0003 region,\nthis would be an extreme possibility. Nevertheless, the\neffect is small and included in the uncertainties we quote.\nRepresentative input \u0003\u0003 S-wave phases, \u0005I\u0001s\u0003, for I \u0005 0,\n2 and the resulting Omne`s functions are shown in Fig. 1.\nNow Low\u2019s low energy theorem [15] requires that as\ns! 0, and t, u! m2\u0003, at the threshold for Compton scat-\ntering \u0002\u0003! \u0002\u0003, the full scattering amplitude is equal to\nits one pion exchange Born term. It is such crossed channel\nexchanges that generate the left-hand cut contribution to\nthe \u0002\u0002 ! \u0003\u0003 partial wave amplitudes, which we denote\ncollectively by LI\u0001s\u0003. Because the pion is so much lighter\nthan any other hadron, pion exchange determines the dis-\nPRL 97, 011601 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending7 JULY 2006\n0031-9007=06=97(1)=011601(4) 011601-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\ncontinuity across this left-hand cut not just at s \u0005 0 but in\nthe whole region 0> s>\u0004M2V , beyond which other ex-\nchanges like \u0004;! start to contribute [16]. While the Born\nterm assumes pointlike couplings for the pion, any form-\nfactor dependence only affects the left-hand cut for s <\n\u0004M2V , since it is vector masses that set the scale for such\ncharged radii. Consequently, the left-hand cut from s \u0005 0\nto s \u2019 \u00040:5 GeV2 is precisely known and that is all we\nrequire to fix the amplitude in the region of s \u0005 sR \u0005 E2R\nshown in Fig. 2.\nTo see how, let us construct the function GI\u0001s\u0003 \u0006\n\u0001F I\u0001s\u0003 \u0004LI\u0001s\u0003\u0003\u0002I\u0001s\u0003\u00041, which only has a right-hand\ncut. Its discontinuity is LI\u0001s\u0003 sin\u0005I\u0001s\u0003=j\u0002I\u0001s\u0003j, which is\naccurately known at low energies. This information is\nembodied in a dispersion relation for the function GI\u0001s\u0003\nusing a contour like that in Fig. 2. While the behavior of\nGI\u0001s\u0003 means the integral at infinity converges with just one\nsubtraction, it is more convenient for our purpose to ensure\nthat the integrals are dominated by the known low energy\nregime of js0j<M2\u0004. This is achieved by making two\nsubtractions:\n F I\u0001s\u0003 \u0005 LI\u0001s\u0003 \u0007 cIs\u0002I\u0001s\u0003 \u0007 s\n2\n\u0003\n\u0002I\u0001s\u0003\n\b\nZ 1\nsth\nds0\nLI\u0001s0\u0003 sin\u0005I\u0001s0\u0003\ns02\u0001s0 \u0004 s\u0003j\u0002I\u0001s0\u0003j ; (2)\nThe constants cI are specified by the QED low energy\ntheorem and chiral dynamics. These two conditions apply\nto amplitudes with pions of definite charge (which are\ncombinations of those with I \u0005 0, 2).

However, its precise position\nhardly affects our results.\nThese relations allow us to determine the \u0002\u0002 ! \u0003\u0003\ncross section in the low energy region. Precision comes\nfrom the more accurate determination of the \u0003\u0003 S-wave\namplitudes obtained by combining new results from de-\ncays like Ke4, J= ! \u0005X, and D! \u0003X [19] with the Roy\nequations, which fixes the pole at s \u0005 sR. This calculation\nreproduces the cross section for the production of charged\nand neutral pions as measured by Mark II [20] and Crystal\nBall [21] collaborations, respectively, in the low energy\nregion with no free parameters. The predictions for the\nneutral cross section are shown in Fig. 3. The range shown\ndelineates the uncertainties due to (i) different \u0002\u0002 phases\n\u0005I\u0001s\u0003 above \u0001KK threshold and (ii) different positions of the\nAdler zero in the \u00030\u00030 channel. Notice that the cross\nsection is very nearly unique up to 450 MeV.\nTwo photon coupling of the \u0001.\u2014Of course, the I \u0005 0\n\u0003\u0003 phase and Omne`s function, shown in Fig. 1, know\nabout the \u0001 pole at s \u0005 sR deep in the complex plane close\nto both the right- and left-hand cuts of Fig. 2. Not only can\nwe determine the \u0002\u0002 amplitudes F I\u0001s\u0003 along the upper\nside of the right-hand cut on the physical sheet where\nexperiments are performed, but everywhere on this first\nsheet. In particular, we can determine the I \u0005 0 amplitude\nat s \u0005 sR, marked in Fig. 2. The right-hand cut structure of\nthe \u0002\u0002 ! \u0003\u0003 amplitude mirrors that of the corresponding\nhadronic amplitude, T I, for \u0003\u0003! \u0003\u0003 in the region of\nelastic unitarity [22]:\n F I\u0001s\u0003 \u0005 \u0006I\u0001s\u0003T I\u0001s\u0003; (3)\nwhere the function \u0006I\u0001s\u0003 represents the intrinsic coupling\nof \u0002\u0002 ! \u0003\u0003, while T describes the final state interac-\ntions, which color and shape the electromagnetic process.\nAt s \u0005 sR on the first sheet, the amplitude T I\u00050\u0001s\u0003 \u0005\ni=2\u0004\u0001s\u0003, since the S-matrix element vanishes at this point.\n0.4 0.6 0.8V\nSR\ns\nKK\nFIG. 2.

If we consider this process and for the mo-\nment simply ignore the requirement that final state inter-\nactions shape the \u0003\u0003 distribution in a well-defined way,\nthen one would say that, with no Born contribution, the\ncross section should reflect the appearance of resonant\nstructures if they exist. If this is the \u0001, then one can read\noff from the observed cross section in Fig. 3 of 10\u201312 nb a\n\u0002\u0002 width an order of magnitude smaller than we have\ndeduced. However, this is too na\u0131\u00a8ve.\nIn hadronic channels, I \u0005 2 amplitudes, which are ex-\notic in the quark model, are much smaller than those with\nI \u0005 0. In contrast in this two photon process both I \u0005 0, 2\nare equally important. The \u0001 appears in the I \u0005 0 ampli-\ntude, and this can only be separated from data by analyzing\n\u0002\u0002 ! \u0003\u0007\u0003\u0004 and \u00030\u00030 together [23].\nAs we have seen what is really happening is that the\nBorn amplitude is modified by final state interactions to\nensure Watson\u2019s theorem is satisfied. As a result, the I \u0005 0\nand 2 amplitudes are no longer real and exactly canceling\nin the neutral channel. A vectorial representation of this is\nshown at 400 MeV in Fig. 4. The I \u0005 0 component has the\nphase of I \u0005 0 S-wave \u0003\u0003 scattering, while that with I \u0005\n2 has the phase of the corresponding isotensor S wave. In\nFig. 4 the vector OC \u0001F 0 \u0007F 2= \u0003\u0003\u00032p \u0003 is \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u00033=2p times the\ncharged channel S wave, while the vector ON \u0001F 0 \u0004\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\np\nF 2\u0003 is \u0004 \u0003\u0003\u00033p times the neutral one. One sees that the\nsquare of the neutral channel S wave (which dominates its\ncross section) is a factor of 12 smaller than the modulus\nsquared of the I \u0005 0 S wave. It is in this amplitude that the\n\u0001 is to be found. This delivers an I \u0005 0 cross section\naveraged across the \u0001 consistent with a 4 keV width\ndetermined from the pole residue.\nHow such a two photon width translates into ideas about\nthe composition of the \u0001 relies on models, which assume a\nN\nC\nF\nF\nB\nF\nF \/\nF\nO\n2\n0\n+-\n00\n2 2 2\nFIG. 4. \u0002\u0002! \u0003\u0003 S-wave amplitudes at 400 MeV with defi-\nnite isospin and with definite charges as indicated by the super-\nscripts.

Its width is too large for a low lying\nglueball. Despite crouching in the cross section \u0002\u0002 !\n\u00030\u00030, the \u2018\u2018red dragon\u2018\u2018 of Minkowski and Ochs [11]\nwith low mass is unlikely to be gluonic. Indeed it would\nappear unlikely to be a \u0001qq state according to the older work\nof [25]. However, 4 keV is just what Chanowitz [26] and\nBarnes [27] have predicted for such a quark state. If it is the\nscalar companion of the f2\u00011275\u0003 with a \u0001 \u0001uu\u0007 \u0001dd\u0003=\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\np\ncomposition, adapting a positronium result to the nonrela-\ntivistic quark model gives\n \u0003\u0001\u0001! \u0002\u0002\u0003=\u0003\u0001f2 ! \u0002\u0002\u0003 \u0005 15=4\b \u0001m\u0001=mf2\u0003n; (8)\nwith relativistic corrections estimated in [28] to be \t0:5.\nThe power n depends on the shape of the potential, being\nn \u0005 3 for a Coulomb form. With \u0003\u0001f2 ! \u0002\u0002\u0003 \u2019 3 keV [2],\nour calculated \u0001 width is reproduced by n \u2019 0:3\u20131, per-\nhaps reflecting the long range nature of the binding needed\nfor this scalar. Such a state, which is very short lived (its\ntotal width is \t550 MeV), inevitably has multiquark com-\nponents in its Fock space. However, these may well be\nmore diffuse than any \u0001qq component and so less able to\nannihilate readily into photons. In keeping with this,\nAchasov [29] and Narison [30] predict tetraquark states\nto have tenths of keV as radiative widths. Thus in terms of\nsimple components a 4 keV width is difficult to reconcile\nwith either a tetraquark or glueball composition, and points\nto a conventional \u0001uu, \u0001dd structure. Hopefully the present\nresult will motivate dynamical calculations in strong cou-\npling QCD to detail the Fock space decomposition of the\n\u0001: \u0001qq, qqqq, gg, \u0003\u0003, etc. Comparison with the 4 keV\nwidth deduced here will teach us whether this enigmatic\nscalar does indeed couple to photons through its \u0001qq\ncomponents.\nI am most grateful to Professor Y.
