Short-term load forecasts\nare required for the control and scheduling of\npower systems. The focus varies from minutes to\nseveral hours ahead. The predictions are required as\ninputs to scheduling algorithms for the generation\nand transmission of electricity. The load forecasts\nhelp in determining which devices to operate in a\ngiven period, so as to minimise costs and securecasting 22 (2006) 1\u201316rs. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u2013162demand even when local failures may occur in the\nsystem.\nIn the short run, the load is mainly influenced\nby meteorological conditions, seasonal effects (daily\nand weekly cycles, calendar holidays) and special\nevents. Weather related variation is certainly critical\nin predicting electricity demand for lead times\nbeyond a day-ahead (Chow & Leung, 1996; Taylor\n& Buizza, 2003). However, when the interest is in\nshorter lead times, a univariate model will be suffi-\ncient. Indeed, univariate models are the norm for\nlead times up to about six hours ahead, and, due to\nthe lack of readily available weather forecasts, they\nare sometimes used for longer lead times. This has\nbeen the case in Brazil where access to weather\nvariables is often difficult and expensive (Souza &\nSoares, 2003). In this paper, we compare the accu-\nracy of two simple benchmarks and four more\nsophisticated univariate methods, including a new\nregression based method that uses principal com-\nponent analysis. We evaluate the methods using\nintra-day data for the state of Rio de Janeiro in\nBrazil and for England and Wales.

Review of methods for short-term univariate\nprediction\nThe stochastic nature of demand as a function of\ntime has frequently been modelled with seasonal\nARIMA and state space models. The latter became\nvery attractive in the 1980s because of the computa-\ntional efficiency of the Kalman filter (e.g., Campo &\nRuiz, 1987) and good performances are still reported\nin more recent work (Infield & Hill, 1998). ARIMA\nmodelling is used by many, within a univariate frame-\nwork, as a sophisticated benchmark for evaluating\nalternative proposals (see, for example, Abraham &\nNath, 2001; Darbellay & Slama, 2000; Laing &\nSmith, 1987; Taylor, 2003). Simpler methods, such\nas nonparametric regression (Charytoniuk, Chen, &\nVan Olinda, 1998) and general exponential smoothing\n(Christiaanse, 1971), are always attractive due to the\nsmall number of parameters involved, which make\nthem easy to implement.The 1990s brought computer power into load fore-\ncasting and with it the opportunity to explore the com-\nplexity in the load data. Rule-based and fuzzy logic\nexpert systems have been used to model the complexity\nin the data using domain knowledge. Although these\nmethods are promising, they rely on rules that are\nextracted from experts\u2019 and operators\u2019 experience,\nwhich are subject to inconsistencies and are thus unre-\nliable. Artificial neural networks have made it possible\nto experiment with theoretically poor, but data rich,\nmodels that can identify the complex non-linear rela-\ntionships in the data and infer future behaviour. The\nbasic idea is that the networks learn through examples,\nwhich consist of the input signals and desired output.\nThe result is that neural networks have the potential to\nmodel a far greater range of relationships than models\nthat have a pre-specified form like ordinary least\nsquares linear regressions.\nIn forecasting electricity demand with neural net-\nworks, most work has used multi-layer perceptron\nnetworks. Early studies concentrated on forecasting\nthe daily peak, valley or total load, or on forecasting\nthe whole daily profile at once. Many have involved\nnon-linear adaptations of the Box\u2013Jenkins methodo-\nlogy (Hippert, Pedreira, & Souza, 2001). Asar and\nMcDonald (1994) present a univariate network for\nJ.W. Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u2013164predicting peak loads. Darbellay and Slama (2000)\npresent a neural network, built only from historical\nhourly load, which matched an ARIMA model for\nprediction from an hour ahead to 36 hours ahead.\nSeveral studies focused on short-term load forecasting\nand took one of two approaches. In the first, a neural\nnetwork is constructed for each type of day or subset\nof hours (e.g., 1:00\u20139:00, 10:00\u201319:00, 20:00\u201324:00).\nThe network is then fed with the relevant input vari-\nables for the corresponding type (Lee, 1992). In the\nsecond approach, a single neural network is deve-\nloped, but within the input variables information con-\ncerning the specific type of day or hour is required\n(e.g., Daneshdoot, Lotfalian, Bumroonggit, & Ngoy,\n1998).\nAmong those who have focused on univariate\nmodels, Liu et al. (1996) address very short-term\nload forecasting. They describe three approaches: a\nfuzzy logic-based method, an artificial neural network\nand an AR model-based approach to predict from one\nminute to 30 minutes ahead based on the previous 30\nminutes of metered data. They conclude that both the\nfuzzy logic and neural network systems outperformed\nthe AR model. The AR model, however, did not\nrequire pre-training and was fairly accurate up to\nfive minutes ahead.\nAlthough some success has been reported with the\nuse of applied neural networks for univariate short term\nload forecasting (e.g., Hippert et al., 2001), there\nremains little systematic evidence in favour of a parti-\ncular architecture, nor on the amount of training data\nthat should be used (Rui & El-Keib, 2004).

Hourly electricity demand in Rio de Janeiro for Surecent papers in applying a neural network on its own\nor combined with fuzzy logic present relatively small\nMAPEs for real and\/or simulated data, but these are\noften not compared to the performance of standard\napproaches on the same data. Consequently, it is not\nclear whether neural networks and more complex non-\nlinear models outperform simpler and more standard\nforecasting procedures, such as ARIMA modelling.\nIn spite of the numerous methods that have been\nreported, we have to agree with Piras and Buchenel\n(1999) that no method has been found to be clearly\nbetter than others. In this paper, we compare the fore-\ncast accuracy of six univariate methods. The four main\nmethods that we consider are: (1) multiplicative sea-\nsonal ARIMA; (2) an exponential smoothing alterna-\ntive because of its robustness which makes it attractive\nfor online demand forecasting; (3) an artificial neural\nnetwork implementation that showed good perfor-\nmance for a similar type of data; and (4) a principal\ncomponent analysis approach, which draws inspiration\nfrom decomposition and regression alternatives. In\naddition, we include a seasonal version of the standard\nna\u0131\u00a8ve random walk benchmark model and we develop\na benchmark that is better suited to the nature of load\ndata.3. The two load time series\nTo evaluate forecasting performance, we used 30\nweeks of hourly observations for electricity demand in\nRio and 30 weeks of half-hourly observations for2688 3360 4032 4704\nHours\nnday, 5 May 1996 to Saturday, 30 November 1996.\nJ.W.

Hourly data has tra-\nditionally been used for short-term forecasting in\nBrazil, and half-hourly in England and Wales. The\nRio data covers the period from Sunday 5 May 1996\nto Saturday 30 November 1996. The England and\nWales data was from the period Monday 27 March\n2000 to Sunday 22 October 2000. The series are\nshown in Figs. 3 and 4.\nAs in many other studies of electricity demand,\nprior to fitting and evaluating methods, we elected to\nsmooth out the dspecial daysT, such as bank holi-\ndays, as their inclusion is likely to be unhelpful in\nour comparison of methods. Demand on these days\nis so very unlike the rest of the year that online\nunivariate methods are generally unable to produce\nreasonable forecasts. In practice, interactive facilities\ntend to be used for special days, which allow opera-\ntor experience to supplement or override the system\noffline. If a forecasting method is unable to tolerate\ngaps in the historical series, the special days can be\nsmoothed over, leaving the natural periodicities of\nthe data intact (Laing & Smith, 1987). An alterna-\ntive to this would be to treat the special days as\nmissing observations.\nFor each series, we used the first 20 weeks of data\nto estimate method parameters and the remaining 10\nweeks to evaluate post-sample accuracy of forecasts\nup to 24 hours ahead. For the Rio series, this\namounted to 3360 hourly observations for estimation\nand 1680 for evaluation. For the England and Wales\nseries, this amounted to 6720 half-hourly observations\nfor estimation and 3360 for evaluation.10000\n20000\n30000\n40000\n50000\n0 1344 2688 4032\nDemand (MW)\nFig. 4. Half-hourly electricity demand in England and Wales fo4. Forecasting methods\n4.1. Double seasonal ARMA modelling\nA short-term forecasting method that has remained\npopular over the years, and often appears as a bench-\nmark approach, is multiplicative seasonal ARIMA\nmodelling. The multiplicative double seasonal\nARIMA model (see Box, Jenkins, & Reinsel, 1994,\np. 333) can be written as\n\/p L\u00f0 \u00deUP1 Ls1\u00f0 \u00deXP2 Ls2\u00f0 \u00derdrD1s1 rD2s2 yt \u0004 c\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00bc hq L\u00f0 \u00deHQ1 Ls1\u00f0 \u00deWQ2 Ls2\u00f0 \u00deet \u00f01\u00de\nwhere yt is demand in period t; c is a constant term; s1\nand s2 are the number of periods in the different sea-\nsonal cycles; L is the lag operator; j is the difference\noperator;js2 andjs2 are seasonal difference operators\n(e.g., js1= (1\u0004Ls1)); d, D1 and D2 are the orders of\ndifferencing; et is a white noise error term; and\/p,UP1,\nXP2, hq, HQ1, and WQ2 are polynomial functions of or-\nders p, P1, P2, q, Q1, and Q2, respectively. This model\ncan be expressed as ARIMA (p,d,q)\u0006 (P1,D1,Q1)s1\u0006\n(P2,D2,Q2)s2. Applying the model to the hourly Rio\ndemand series, we set s1=24 to model the within-day\nseasonal cycle of 24 hours, and s2=168 to model the\nwithin-week cycle of 168 hours. For the England and\nWales half-hourly series, we set s1=48 and s2=336.\nThe process of model identification is impractical\nin an online demand forecasting system, and so the\nmodel is chosen offline.

The autocorrelation function and partial\nautocorrelation function were used to select the order of\nthe model, which was then estimated by maximum\nlikelihood. The residuals were inspected for any\nremaining autocorrelation. Laing and Smith (1987)\nexplain that, in the multiplicative double seasonal\nARIMA formulation in expression (1), polynomials\nof order greater than two are rarely necessary when\nfitting a model to half-hourly data for England and\nWales. We also found for our England and Wales data\nthat polynomials of order two were sufficient. How-\never, this was not sufficient for the Rio data because\nsignificant autocorrelation remained in the residuals.\nBy using polynomials up to order three, we eliminated\nthe residual autocorrelation. We compared the\nSchwartz Bayesian information Criterion (SBC) for\nan extensive range of different ARIMA models.

Exponential smoothing for double seasonality\nThe widespread use of exponential smoothing in\nautomated applications, such as inventory control, led\nTaylor (2003) to consider the use of the approach for\nonline electricity demand forecasting. The application\nrequires an extension of the standard Holt\u2013Winters\nexponential smoothing formulation to accommodate\nthe two seasonal cycles in the electricity demand\nseries. This involves the introduction of an additionalseasonal index and an extra smoothing equation for\nthe new seasonal index. The formulation for double\nmultiplicative seasonality is given in the following\nexpressions:\nSt \u00bc a yt= Dt\u0004s1Wt\u0004s2\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0004 a\u00f0 \u00de St\u00041 \u00fe Tt\u00041\u00f0 \u00de \u00f02\u00de\nTt \u00bc c St \u0004 St\u00041\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0004 c\u00f0 \u00deTt\u00041 \u00f03\u00de\nDt \u00bc d yt= StWt\u0004s2\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0004 d\u00f0 \u00deDt\u0004s1 \u00f04\u00de\nWt \u00bc x yt= StDt\u0004s1\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0004 x\u00f0 \u00deWt\u0004s2 \u00f05\u00de\ny\u02c6t k\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc St \u00fe kTt\u00f0 \u00deDt\u0004s1\u00fekWt\u0004s2\u00fek\n\u00fe \/k yt \u0004 St\u00041 \u00fe Tt\u00041\u00f0 \u00deDt\u0004s1Wt\u0004s2\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nSt and Tt, are the smoothed level and trend; Dt andWt\nare the seasonal indices for the intraday and intraweek\nseasonal cycles, respectively; a, c, d and x are the\nsmoothing parameters; and y\u02c6t(k) is the k step-ahead\nforecast made from forecast origin t. The term invol-\nving the parameter \/, in the forecast function expres-\nsion Eq. (6), is a simple adjustment for first-order\nautocorrelation. All the parameters in the method, a,\nc, d, x and \/, are estimated in a single procedure by\nminimizing the sum of squared one step-ahead in-\nsample errors. The initial smoothed values for the\nlevel, trend and seasonal components are estimated\nby averaging the early observations. As with the\ndouble-seasonal ARIMA model, applying the method\nto the Rio hourly data, we set s1=24 and s2=168,\nwhile for the half-hourly England and Wales series,\ns1=48 and s2=336.\nIn our implementation of the method, we calcu-\nlated initial smoothed values for the level, trend and\nseasonal components using the approach described by\nTaylor (2003), which involves averaging the early\nobservations. Table 1 shows the parameters that we\nJ.W. Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u201316 7estimated. The parameters for the England and Wales\nseries are reasonably similar to those reported by\nTaylor for a shorter series of England and Wales\ndemand. The high value of \/ and low value of a,\nfor both series, reflects the fact that the adjustment\nfor first-order autocorrelation has, to a large degree,\nmade redundant the smoothing equation for the level.\nThe low values for the trend smoothing parameter, c,\nwere accompanied by very small values for the\nsmoothed trend, Tt. This seems reasonable since\nvariation in the 20-week estimation periods are\ndominated by seasonality.\nAn important point to note regarding the double\nseasonal exponential smoothing approach is that, by\ncontrast with ARIMA modelling and the majority of\nother approaches to short-term demand forecasting,\nthere is no model specification involved. This gives\nthe method strong appeal in terms of simplicity and\nrobustness.\n4.3. Artificial neural network\nWe felt that it was important to include a neural\nnetwork in our study because this approach has\nreceived a great deal of attention in the load forecast-\ning literature in recent years. However, a basic pro-\nblem that we faced was which form of neural network\nto use. The neural network load forecasting literature\ncontains many different approaches and designs, but\nthere is no consensus as to the preferred form. We\nopted to implement a similar neural network model-\nling approach to the one described relatively recently\nin this journal by Darbellay and Slama (2000) for\ntheir forecasting of hourly demand in the Czech\nRepublic. We chose this approach because it was\nused for a univariate application involving similar\ndata to ours. We are, therefore, providing more evi-\ndence in an area where replication with similar data is\nrare.\nWe used a single hidden layer feedforward net-\nwork, which is the most widely-used neural network\nfor forecasting (Zhang, Patuwo, & Hu, 1998). It\nconsists of a set of k inputs, which are connected\nto each of m units in a single hidden layer, which,\nin turn, are connected to an output. In regression\nterminology, the inputs are explanatory variables,\nxit, and the output is the dependent variable, yt.\nIn this study, the output is demand and the inputsare lag demand. The resultant model can be written\nas\nf xt; v;w\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc g2\nXm\nj\u00bc0\nvjg1\nXk\ni\u00bc0\nwjixit\n! ! \nwhere g1(d ) and g2(d ) are activation functions, which\nwe chose to be sigmoidal and linear, respectively, and\nwji and vj are the weights (parameters). We estimated\nthe weights using the following minimisation\nmin\nv;w\n \n1\nn\nXn\nt\u00bc1\nyt \u0004 f xt; v;w\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de2\n\u00fe k1\nXm\nj\u00bc0\nXk\ni\u00bc0\nw2ji \u00fe k2\nXm\nj\u00bc0\nv2i\n!\nwhere n is the number of in-sample observations, and\nk1 and k2 are regularisation parameters which pena-\nlise the complexity of the network and thus avoid\noverfitting (see Bishop, 1997, \u00a79.2). We established\nsuitable values for k1 and k2 and for the number, m, of\nunits in the hidden layer using a hold out method with\na third of the estimation sample used for testing (see\nBishop, 1997, \u00a79.8).\nNeural networks will perform poorly if the time\nseries is nonstationary (Cottrell, Girard, Girard, Man-\ngeas, & Muller, 1995). In our ARIMA modelling of\nthe estimation samples of data for both the Rio and\nEngland and Wales data, we found no justification for\ndifferencing. Indeed, we found that the best fit,\nassessed in terms of SBC, resulted when no differen-\ncing was used. However, Fig. 4 shows that the within-\nyear cycle in the England and Wales data appears in\nour 30-week sample as a trend through the data. The\nplot in Fig. 3 for the Rio data also shows a slight rise\nin the level of the data, which is due to demand rising\nin response to the need for air conditioning in the\nwarmer months. In their ARMA analysis, apparent\nnonstationarities led Darbellay and Slama (2000) to\napply to their hourly demand data, yt, the following\ndifferencing operator: (1\u0004L)(1\u0004L24)(1\u0004L168)yt.\nPrior to fitting the neural network, we applied the\nsame operator to our hourly Rio data, and for the\nEngland and Wales half-hourly data, we used\n(1\u0004L)(1\u0004L48)(1\u0004L336)yt.\nWe drew inspiration from the study of Darbellay\nand Slama (2000) for our choice of lagged demand to\nJ.W. Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u2013168use as input variables. For the hourly Rio data, we\nconsidered the following lags: 1 to 6, 23, 24, 25, 48,\n72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288, 312\nand 336. The hold out method led us to use\nk1=k2=0.005 and m =12, and to use the following\nlags in our model: 1, 2, 24, 25, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144,\n168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 312 and 336. For the half-\nhourly England and Wales data, we considered the\nfollowing lags: 1 to 12, 47, 48, 49, 96, 144, 192, 240,\n288, 336, 384, 432, 480, 528, 576, 624 and 672. The\nhold out method led us to use k1=k2=0.005 and\nm =14, and the following lags: 1, 48, 49, 96, 144,\n192, 240, 288, 336, 384, 432, 480, 624 and 672.\nNote that a single model was estimated for each of\nthe two demand series. As with the other models fitted\nin this paper, parameters were estimated using the\nestimation sample of data for each series, and the\nparameters were not updated after this. One step-\nahead forecasts were iteratively used as inputs in\norder to generate multi-step predictions.\n4.4. A regression method with principal component\nanalysis\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a standard\nstatistical method that is used for reducing the dimen-\nsion of multivariate data sets, where variables are\nhighly correlated, to a smaller set of variables.\nThese are linear combinations of the original vari-\nables; they are uncorrelated and explain most of the\nvariation in the data and are thus called principal\ncomponents. In a regression context, one can therefore\nfocus on this smaller number of independent vari-\nables, rather than dealing with the large number of\noriginal variables with complex interrelationships\n(Chaterjee, Hadi, & Price, 1999).\nHere, we employ PCA to capture the intra-day\nvariation in electricity demand. The method can be\nviewed as a development of the approach of Rama-\nnathan, Engle, Granger, Vahid-Araghi, and Brace\n(1997) and Carnero, Koopman, and Ooms (2003)\nand others who model each hour (or half-hour) sepa-\nrately. The essence of our PCA method is that it\nexploits the similarity between certain hours (or\nhalf-hours) in order to reduce the number of models\nto be considered. We note that the approach could\neasily be extended to the multivariate context, if\nweather related variables were available.For each day i that is considered, let the Yij denote\nthe electricity demand on day i at intra-day period j,\nwhere i=1, . . . , N and j =1, . . . , M. Note that M =24\nfor the hourly Brazil data and M =48 for the half-\nhourly England and Wales data. The matrix Y is then\nused to construct a matrix C by summing over the\ntime coordinate: C=(N\u00041)\u00041 \/ 2 YTY. The standard\neigenvalue decomposition yields C=V\u00012VT, where\nV is an orthonormal matrix satisfying VTV= I=VVT,\nand \u00012 is a positive definite diagonal matrix; the\npositive square roots rj of its diagonal are known as\nthe singular values of C (Strang, 1993). These singu-\nlar values are typically arranged in decreasing order so\nthat r1zr2 z . . .zrM. The columns of V, vj, are the\northogonal basis functions, each of which contributes\nrj\n2 to the total variance. The principal components are\nobtained by projecting the daily electricity demand\nprofiles onto these basis functions or reduced dimen-\nsion space. That is: P=YV, where the ith column of P\nis the component corresponding to the ith basis func-\ntion. These elements in the column describe patterns\nthat are associated with the different days of the week.\nFor example, the lowest loads should be associated\nwith Sunday and the highest with midweek.\nWhile PCA provides a technique for modelling the\nintra-day pattern, the weekly seasonality has yet to be\nincorporated. This is achieved by regressing each\nprincipal component on six dummy variables that\nindicate the day of the week (Monday to Saturday\nwith Sunday arbitrarily chosen as the baseline) plus a\nlinear and a quadratic term. The latter two terms\ncapture the amount of linear and quadratic growth\n(or decay) of the electricity demand over time and\nare justified within a short range by scatterplots of the\ndata. If we had several years of data for estimating this\nregression, the quadratic term could easily be replaced\nby a harmonic function that could be identified from\nthe time series pattern of each component. The regres-\nsion model for the qth principal component is, there-\nfore, of the following form:\npq i\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc aq0 \u00fe aq1d1 \u00fe . . . \u00fe aq6d6 \u00fe bqi\u00fe kqi2\n\u00fe error i\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere i is a label for the ith day in the dataset; dl\n(for l=0, . . . ,6) are dummy variables indicating the\nday of the week; and aql, bq and cq are constant\nparameters. This model can then be used to forecast\nJ.W. Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u201316 9each of the components, pq(i +1), for up to one day\nahead.\nThere are two parameters which are required for\nspecifying the model: (i) the number of weeks, W,\nused to compute the principal components, and (ii)\nthe number of principal components, Q, that are kept\n(QVM). The second half of the 20 week estimation\nsample of data for both the England andWales and Rio\ndata sets was used to estimate the model parametersW\nand Q and the coefficients in the error model. The aim\nwas to find the model with the best mean absolute\npercentage error (MAPE), averaged over all the intra-\nday samples, for the training data. Both W and Q were\nvaried until a minimum value ofMAPEwas found. The\nresults given in Section 5 were obtained using values\nW=10 and Q =24 for the England and Wales data and\nW=10 and Q =8 for the Rio data.\nHaving selected Q, this model approximates the\nmatrix of demand profiles and the forecasts for intra-\nday period j of day i +1 are given by\nXQ\nq\u00bc1\npq i\u00fe 1\u00f0 \u00deVjq;\nwhere the first Q columns of the matrix V contain the\nmost relevant empirical orthogonal functions.\nAfter applying this model, we found that the errors\nwere serially correlated. We therefore followed a\nsimilar approach to that of Taylor (2003) for his\nexponential smoothing method, and adjusted the\nmodel by adding an AR model of the error process.\nAs our PCA approach is an extension of the approach\nof Ramanathan et al. (1997), it is interesting to note\nthat they also incorporate an error model in order to\ncorrect for serial correlation resulting from their use of\nseparate models for each hour of the day. In the\nparticular case of the hourly Rio data, we define\nEt(k) as the prediction error associated with a k\nstep-ahead forecast made from origin t, which is\nobserved to be highly correlated with both the corre-\nsponding prediction error that occurred 24 hours\nbefore, Et\u0004 24(k), as well as the last known prediction\nerror, Et\u0004 1(1). Consequently, each future prediction\nerror, Et(k), is estimated by an expression of the form:\nEt k\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc a0 k\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe a1 k\u00f0 \u00deEt\u000424 k\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe a2 k\u00f0 \u00deEt\u00041 1\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere the al(k) are parameters estimated separately\nfor each lead time, k, using LS regression applied tothe estimation sample. For the England and Wales\ndata, a similar pattern was observed and thus the lag\n24 term in the model is replaced by a lag 48 term.\n4.5. Two simplistic benchmark methods\nThe random walk is the most widely used and\nsimplest na\u0131\u00a8ve benchmark method used in forecasting\nstudies. However, for multi-step-ahead forecasting of\nseasonal data, the method is likely to perform poorly.\nA more natural benchmark forecast is provided by the\nseasonal version of the random walk, which takes as a\nforecast the observed value for the corresponding\nperiod in the most recent occurrence of the seasonal\ncycle. With two seasonal cycles within the data, it\nseems sensible to focus on the longer cycle, so that\nthe prediction is constructed simply as the observed\nvalue for the corresponding period in the previous\nweek. For the hourly Rio data, the forecast function\nis y\u02c6t(k)=yt + k\u0004 168, where yt is the demand in period t,\nand k is the forecast lead time (kV168). For the half-\nhourly England and Wales data, y\u02c6t(k)=yt + k\u0004 336\n(where kV336). In our discussion of the results in\nSection 5, we refer to this forecasting approach as the\ndna\u0131\u00a8ve benchmarkT.\nWe used this forecasting approach as the basis of a\nsecond benchmark method. We refined the forecasts\nfrom the method by using the error modelling\napproach that was described in Section 4.4 for mod-\nelling the errors from the PCA method. In our discus-\nsion of the results in Section 5, we refer to this\nforecasting approach as the dna\u0131\u00a8ve benchmark with\nerror modelT.5. Results\nFigs. 5 and 6 show the post-sample forecasting\naccuracy of the six methods for lead times up to a\nday ahead for each of the two series. The error sum-\nmary measure reported in the figures is the mean\nabsolute percentage error (MAPE), which has been\ntraditionally used to measure accuracy in load fore-\ncasting. Because the MAPE captures the proportion-\nality between the forecast error and the actual load, it\nis preferred and easily interpreted by those in the\nindustry. Hippert et al. (2001) write that, although\nthe MAPE has become an industry standard, it is\n0%\n1%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n5%\n0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24\nLead time (hours)\nMAPE\nNa\u00efve Benchmark\nNa\u00efve Benchmark with Error Model\nNeural Network\nSeasonal ARMA\nRegression with PCA\nExponential Smoothing\nFig. 5. MAPE results plotted against lead time for the Rio 10-week post-sample period.\nJ.W. Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u20131610advisable to also consider other summary measures.\nWe also calculated the mean absolute error, median\nabsolute percentage error, median absolute error, root\nmean squared percentage error and root mean squared\nerror, but we do not report these results here because\nthe relative performances of the methods for these\nmeasures were very similar to those for the MAPE.\nTurning first to the Rio results in Fig. 5, we can see\nthat the na\u0131\u00a8ve benchmark was substantially outper-\nformed by all the other methods at all lead times.\nInterestingly, however, Fig. 5 shows that a substantial\nimprovement resulted from the application of the heur-\nistic derror modelT to correct for autocorrelation in the\nforecast errors from this method. Perhaps the most\nsurprising aspect of the results was the relatively poor\nperformance of the neural network. It was unable to\nbeat the na\u0131\u00a8ve benchmark with error model, and it was\ncomfortably beaten by the ARMA, exponential\nsmoothing and PCA methods. Of these three methods,\nthe exponential smoothing approach performed parti-\ncularly well. The plot of the full sample of observationsin Fig. 3 suggests a partial explanation for this.\nBetween periods 3360 and 4032, there seems to be a\nslight change in the seasonal pattern. This four-week\nperiod is the first four weeks of the 10-week post-\nsample evaluation period, and it is shown in Fig. 7.\nThis figure seems to indicate a slight change in the\nseasonal pattern occurring a fortnight into the evalua-\ntion period. The change occurred around 6 October\n1996, which was the start of summer time in Rio, and\non this day the clocks were moved forward one hour.\n(In order to maintain 24 periods in this day, the two\ndemand values at 00 :00 were averaged.) Therefore, it\nwould seem that all the methods have been somewhat\nchallenged by being evaluated on data with slightly\ndifferent characteristics to the data in the estimation\nsample. In this context, the robustness of the meth-\nods becomes important. The popularity of exponen-\ntial smoothing in other applications, such as sales\nforecasting and financial volatility forecasting, is at\nleast partly due to its robustness. We, therefore,\nconclude that this is a reason for the success of\n0.0%\n0.5%\n1.0%\n1.5%\n2.0%\n2.5%\n0 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48\nLead time (half-hours)\nMAPE\nNa\u00efve Benchmark\nNa\u00efve Benchmark with Error Model\nNeural Network\nSeasonal ARMA\nRegression with PCA\nExponential Smoothing\nFig. 6.

Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u201316 11this approach over the ARMA and PCA methods.\nFor both series, we did see a slight deterioration in\nthe performance of each method as the method was\npassed though the 10-week evaluation period, which\nmotivates an updating of the methods. However, in\nour study, we opted not to re-specify or re-estimate\nmethods because we felt that in practice it would be\nimpractical to update, on a frequent basis, the\nARIMA and neural network models.\nBy contrast with the Rio data, the England and\nWales series, shown in Fig. 4, does not seem to change\nits characteristics in the post-sample evaluation period.\nOur results for this series, therefore, provide insight\ninto whether the exponential smoothing method is able\nto offer anything more than just simplicity and robust-\nness. The results in Fig. 6 show that the exponential\nsmoothing method did in fact perform well for the\nEngland and Wales series. It outperformed all the\nother methods at all lead times, except the PCA\nmethod, which has lower MAPE for lead times 12 to\n32. As with the Rio data, the na\u0131\u00a8ve benchmark wasoutperformed by all the other methods, but was vastly\nimproved by the inclusion of the heuristic error model.\nFor the England and Wales data, the neural network\nwas competitive for the early lead times, but beyond\nabout 10 steps ahead (5 hours ahead), it performed\npoorly.\nWe were surprised that the performance of the\nneural network relative to the ARMA model was so\nmuch worse than that reported by Darbellay and Slama\n(2000) for their very similar neural network. Our expla-\nnation for this is that their data possessed different\ncharacteristics to ours. Firstly, an obvious point is that\nthey used data from a different country and this data\nmay have had stronger non-linearities than our series,\nwhich would have helped the neural network. The data\nin the Czech Republic study certainly looks more\ndnoisyT than the two series that we have analysed;\nsome of this apparent dnoiseT may be non-linearity.\nSecondly, they only report results for models fitted\nand evaluated on weekday observations.

Thirdly, in contrast to our use of 30 weeks of data,\nDarbellay and Slama used one full year of data to\nestimate their models and a second complete year for\nevaluation. The additional observations and the expo-\nsure to the full within-year seasonal cycle may have\ngreatly benefited the Darbellay and Slama network. We\nshould also comment that if a particular neural network\nmodel does not perform well, as in our paper, one\ncannot be certain whether neural networks are, in gen-\neral, poor predictors because a different specification of\nneural network might have performed better. Another\nreason for the poor performance of the neural network\ncould be that we used forecasted values as inputs for the\nmulti-step predictions. Non-linear models can spread\nerrors very dramatically. A neural network model\ndeveloped directly for given horizons (e.g., 24 neural\nnetwork models or a model with 24 outputs) could\nperhaps produce better results.\nIn the introduction, we explained that univariate\nmethods are mainly used for predicting load up to\nlead times of about six hours.

The results are much closer for the one\nhour-ahead prediction.

The two series both show the weekly\nand daily seasonal patterns that are common to load\ndata, but the series exhibit different degrees of sta-\nbility in the seasonality and thus present somewhat\ndifferent forecasting problems.\nA highlight of this study was the success of the\nexponential smoothing method. In addition to its fore-\ncasting performance, it is important to note that, of the\nfour sophisticated methods that we considered, this\nmethod is comfortably the simplest and quickest to15 18 21 24\nLead time (hours)\n, plotted against lead time, for the Rio 10-week post-sample period.\nJ.W. Taylor et al. \/ International Journal of Forecasting 22 (2006) 1\u201316 15implement. On the disappointing side, the neural net-\nwork did not perform well. We do not believe that this\nwas due to overfitting or an overly complex architec-\nture, which are two common pitfalls in neural network\nmodelling. Instead, the poor performance may have\nresulted because we did not separate the data into\nweekday and weekend observations and then build\nseparate models for each dataset. Other possibilities\nare that we used less data than previous authors or,\nquite simply, the non-linearity in our data may be\nnegligible.\nThe PCA method was certainly competitive for the\nEngland and Wales data, which prompted us to con-\nsider a combination. For this series, a slight improve-\nment was achieved by combining the exponential\nsmoothing method and the PCA method using a\nsimple average. This motivates further consideration\nof combining (see Smith, 1989; Taylor & Majithia,\n2000), and of the development of a method that is able\nto synthesise the useful features of the exponential\nsmoothing and PCA methods.Acknowledgements\nPatrick E.
