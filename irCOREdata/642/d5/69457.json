The delivery of contaminated agricultural drainage waters into first order streams may \nimpact the quality and ecological balance of watercourses if the micro-organisms of concern are \nstill viable. This chapter evaluates both die-off and transfer processes operating from source \nthrough to the end point receptors in surface waters.
