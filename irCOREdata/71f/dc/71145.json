Experimental results from three ionospheric HF\npumping experiments in overdense E or F regions are sum-\nmarized. The experiments were conducted by the use of the\nEISCAT HF Heating facility located near Troms\u00f8, Norway,\nallowing HF pumping the ionosphere in a near geomagnetic\nfield-aligned direction. Distinctive features related to auro-\nral activations in the course of the experiments are identified.\nTypical features observed in all experiments are the follow-\ning: generation of scattered components in dynamic HF radio\nscatter Doppler spectra; strong increase of ion temperatures\nTi and local ionospheric electric field E0; modification of the\nauroral arc and local spiral-like formation. However, some\neffects were observed only when the HF pump wave was re-\nflected from the F2 layer. Among them are the generation\nof intense field-aligned ion outflows, and a strong increase\nin the electron temperature Te with altitude. A possible sce-\nnario for the substorm triggering due to HF pumping into an\nauroral ionosphere is discussed. The authors present their in-\nterpretation of the data as follows. It is suggested that two\npopulations of charged particles are at play. One of them\nis the runaway population of electrons and ions from the\nionosphere caused by the effects of the powerful HF radio\nwave. The other is the population of electrons that precipi-\ntate from the magnetosphere. It is shown that the hydrody-\nnamical equilibrium was disrupted due to the effects of the\nHF pumping. We estimate that the parallel electric field can\nreach values of the order of 30 mV\/m during substorm trig-\ngering.\nKey words.

Blagoveshchenskaya\n(nataly@aari.nw.ru)\n1 Introduction\nThe significance of the general class of problems related to\nthe manmade impact on the near-Earth space environment is\nevident from the results of well-known scientific programs\nsuch as TRIGGER, CRRES, CEDAR, and HAARP. Never-\ntheless, a number of crucial problems still remain unsolved,\namong them those associated with the modification of the\nionosphere-magnetosphere coupling, the possible active role\nof the ionosphere in magnetospheric dynamics, and the re-\nsponse of the ionosphere-magnetosphere system to artificial\nperturbations. The controlled injection of powerful radio\nwaves into space from purpose-built ground-based HF ra-\ndio facilities has proved to be an excellent tool for studying\nthe associated fundamental linear and nonlinear plasma pro-\ncesses and instabilities.\nConsiderable success has been achieved by the use of the\nEISCAT HF Heating facility located at auroral latitudes in\nTroms\u00f8, Norway (see, for example, Stubbe, 1996 (and ref-\nerences therein); Thide\u00b4 et al., 1982; 1983; Rietveld et al.,\n1993, 2000; Robinson et al., 1998; Leyser, 2001; Leyser et\nal., 1989; Isham et al., 1990; 1999; Jones et al., 1984; Honary\net al., 1999; Yeoman et al., 1997; Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m et al., 1999;\nEglitis et al., 1998; Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 1998b; Kosch\net al., 2000).\nIt should be noted that in most HF pumping experiments\nperformed hitherto, the plasma physics aspect has, for ob-\nvious reasons, dominated. However, taking the distinctive\nfeatures and behavior of the auroral ionosphere into account,\none would expect that the interaction between powerful HF\nradio waves and the auroral near-Earth space plasma can lead\nto the generation of specific modification effects not encoun-\ntered at middle latitudes. As this article will show, this is\nindeed the case.\n88 N. F. Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: Phenomena in the ionosphere-magnetosphere system\n 34\n \n \n \nTable 1.

Operational modes of the EISCAT HF heating facility\nduring experiments.\nA large volume of work has been conducted by many sci-\nentists in understanding auroral substorm (see, for exam-\nple, Akasofu, 1964; Kamide and Baumjohann, 1993; Kan,\n1993; Foster, 1995; Lyons, 1996; Sergeev et al. 1996; Ros-\ntoker, 1999). Nonetheless, some problems still remaine un-\nsolved, among them is the role of internal instabilities in the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere system leading to substorm trig-\ngering, a role of the auroral ionosphere in the substorm pro-\ncess. In this respect HF pumping experiments at auroral lat-\nitudes can provide answers to such problems. Experimental\nresults from multi-instrument observations during Troms\u00f8\nionospheric modification experiments (Blagoveshchenskaya\net al., 2001), make it evident that HF pumping into a sporadic\nauroral Es layer in the near field-aligned direction, can lead\nto a local auroral activation. The results obtained suggest\nthat the energy source for such activations is the interaction\nbetween the solar wind and the magnetosphere.\nCertain possibilities of HF pumping experiments related to\nthe role of the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator (IAR) in auroral\nphenomena were considered by Trakhtengerts et al. (2000).\nThe theory developed allows for two types of triggering of\nthe Alfve\u00b4n vortex instability (AVI) in the IAR. The first is\nthe generation of a resonant current in the dynamo region\nof the ionosphere. Its frequency and spatial scale across the\nmagnetic field should coincide with the eigenfrequency and\nwavelength of the Alfve\u00b4n vortex. The second type is based\non a non-resonant local variation of the macroscopic electric\nfield that can artificially turn on the AVI in the heated region\n(Trakhtengerts et al., 2000).\nExcitation of Alfve\u00b4n waves by modulated HF heating of\nthe ionosphere, as well as the stimulated electron precipi-\ntation, was detected from the FAST satellite at an altitude\nof 2550 km above the Troms\u00f8 HF heater (Robinson et al.,\n2000).\nIn the present paper we invest our efforts on the fur-\nther research of the ionospheric modification effects in the\nionosphere-magnetosphere system caused by powerful HF\nradio waves. The main attention has been paid to the search\nfor distinctive features related to the modification of the\nionosphere-magnetosphere coupling in the course of three\nTroms\u00f8 HF pumping experiments in the nightside auroral\nionosphere. Experimental results from multi-instrument ob-\nservations in the course of the experiment on 2 October 1998\nare examined in detail. In this event, the HF pump wave was\nreflected from the F2 layer in contrast to other experiments,\nwhen the powerful wave was reflected from a sporadic Es\nlayer. The possible mechanisms responsible for the trigger-\ning of local auroral activations due to the effects of powerful\nHF radio waves are also discussed. The successful resolu-\ntion of the problem concerning the HF pump wave impact\non the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling that could lead\nto the triggering of auroral activations requires the follow-\ning: (1) fundamental studies in several fields and sub-fields,\nincluding plasma instabilities and nonlinear phenomena, on\nthe one hand, and environmental magnetospheric physics,\non the other; (2) the use of multi-instrument observations,\nnew instruments, methods and observational methodology;\n(3) the performance of HF pumping experiments under spe-\ncific geophysical conditions; (4) consistant, repeatable ef-\nfects needed, that is more events showing the same effect.\nBelow we present our interpretation of the experimental\ndata obtained in the course of HF ionospheric modification\nexperiments in the nightside auroral ionosphere.\n2 Description of the HF pumping experiments\nThe experiments reported here were carried out by the use\nof the EISCAT HF Heating facility (Rietveld et al., 1993)\nlocated near Troms\u00f8, Norway (geographical coordinates\n69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E; magnetic dip angle I=78\u25e6). We have sum-\nmarized the experimental findings from such experiments\nperformed in the nightside auroral ionosphere on 16 and 17\nFebruary 1996, and 2 October 1998. Notable is that in the\ncourse of the experiment on 16 February 1996, two auroral\nevents occurred. A distinctive feature of the experiments is\nthe tilt of the heater antenna beam to the south from zenith of\n6\u25e6 or 12\u25e6, thus allowing HF pumping in a near field-aligned\ndirection. The heating phased antenna array No. 2 was used\nin all experiments. The duration of the heater-on cycles was\nin all cases 4 or 8 minutes. The operational modes and the\nmain parameters of the HF Heating facility for the experi-\nments are given in Table 1.\nThe diagnostics of the ionospheric plasma based on ef-\nfects due to HF pumping comprised multi-instrument obser-\nvations from bistatic HF Doppler scatter (Blagoveshchen-\nskaya et al., 1998a), the European Incoherent Scatter (EIS-\nCAT) UHF radar (Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993), the digital\nall-sky imager DASI (Kosch et al., 1998), and the Interna-\ntional Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE)\nmagnetometer network in Scandinavia (Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998).\nAdditionally, bistatic scatter measurements of HF diagnostic\nsignals were carried out on the London\u2013Troms\u00f8\u2013St. Peters-\nburg path at operational frequencies of 12,095 and 9410 kHz.\nThe diagnostic HF transmitter is located near London (52\u25e6 N,\n0\u25e6 E). The reception of the diagnostic waves, scattered from\nN. F. Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: Phenomena in the ionosphere-magnetosphere system 89\nfield-aligned irregularities (FAIs) above Troms\u00f8, was made\nwith a Doppler spectral method in St. Petersburg (60\u25e6 N,\n30.5\u25e6 E) at a great circle distance of\u223c1200 km from Troms\u00f8.\nThe condition for a bistatic scatter is given by\n(k0 \u00b7 B)=(kS \u00b7 B) , (1)\nwhere k0 and kS are the wave vectors of the incident and\nscattered wave respectively, andB is the vector of the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field. A general view of the experiment geometry\nis shown in Fig. 1 of Blagoveshchenskaya et al. (2001). The\nsimulation of bistatic scatter geometry for Troms\u00f8 HF pump-\ning experiments is given by Borisova et al., (2002).\nThe onsets of the activations are the following: 21:21 and\n22:41 UT on 16 February 1996; 20:33 UT on 17 February\n1996, 19:30 UT on 2 October 1998. The first three activa-\ntions were observed when the powerful HF radio waves were\nreflected from the sporadic Es layers, but the last activation\noccurred when the HF pump wave was reflected from the F2\nlayer.\nIn addition to IMAGE magnetometer data, AE, AU, and\nAL indices of the auroral activity, the PC index from the near\npole Vostok magnetic station (Troshichev et al., 1988), the\nDst index of the magnetic activity, and parameters of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field from the IMP-8 satellite have\nbeen used in the analysis of the auroral activations.\nThe results from the multi-instrument observations dur-\ning Troms\u00f8 HF pumping experiments on 16 and 17 Febru-\nary 1996, when the powerful HF radio wave was reflected\nfrom the sporadic Es layer, were analyzed in detail by\nBlagoveshchenskaya et al. (2001). Experimental findings\nfrom the experiment of 2 October 1998, under the reflection\nof the HF pump wave from the F2 layer of the ionosphere,\nare given in the next section.\n3 Observational results of 2 October 1998\nThe experiment on 2 October 1998 was conducted during\nplanetary-scale disturbed magnetic conditions. The values of\ntheDst index ranged between\u221256 and\u221261 nT. The behavior\nof the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) as measured from\nthe IMP-8 satellite is shown in Fig. 1. The top panel in Fig. 1\ndisplays variations of the PC index from the near-pole Vostok\nstation. One can see that the Bz component of the IMF was\nsteadily southward from 16:00 to 22:00 UT.\nIonograms from the Troms\u00f8 dynasonde showed that the\ncritical frequencies of the F2 layer increased from 4.1 MHz\nat 19:00 UT to 5.5 MHz at 19:30 UT. A sporadic Es layer is\nalso identified in the ionograms, but its maximum frequency\ndid not exceed 3.5 MHz. Therefore, in the experiment the HF\npump wave (fH=4040 kHz) was certainly reflected from the\nF2 layer.\nIMAGE magnetograms for the event on 2 October 1998\nare presented in Fig. 2. It can be seen that a substorm activa-\ntion occurred at 19:30 UT between the SOR (70.54\u25e6 N) and\nPEL (66.9\u25e6 N) magnetic stations. A westward electrojet ap-\npeared between the MAS (69.46\u25e6 N) and MUO (68.02\u25e6 N)\n 38\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

This can be clearly seen\nmore accurately from the X\u2212Z profiles obtained from the\nIMAGE magnetometers (see Fig. 3). Taking into account the\ntilt of the Troms\u00f8 heater antenna beam by 12\u25e6 to the south\nand the size of the heated patch in the F2 layer, it is possible\nto conclude that the electrojet appeared in the southern part of\nthe heated patch.

In reality, from the CUTLASS HF\nradar measurements the spatial size of the heated patch can\noccupy a region significantly larger than the area contained\nwithin 3 dB contour (Robinson et al., 1998). It is interest-\ning to note that a southward displacement preference was\nobserved in other heater-induced phenomena during other\nHF pumping experiments, such as the radio-induced airglow\n(Kosch et al., 2000), and Langmuir turbulence (Isham et al.,\n1999) which may excite energetic electrons. The behavior of\nthe AE index describing the auroral activity as a whole also\nshows that the substorm occurred at 19:30 UT.\nFigure 4 displays dynamic Doppler spectra of HF diag-\nnostic signals obtained on 2 October 1998, on the London\u2013\nTroms\u00f8\u2013St. Petersburg path, for a radio scatter operational\nfrequency of 12 095 kHz from 18:57 to 19:46 (Fig. 4a) and\nfrom 20:01 to 20:45 UT (Fig. 4b). One can see that during\nheater-on periods, 19:00\u201319:08 and 19:15\u201319:23 UT, the am-\nplification of natural field-aligned irregularities can be rec-\nognized in the positive part of the Doppler sonogram. The\nheater turn-off at 19:23 UT is accompanied by the appear-\nance of continuous noise-like spectral broadening. Then the\nburst-like noise enhancement in the dynamic Doppler spectra\nover a frequency range up to 20 Hz starts at about 19:27 UT\n(see Fig. 4a), i.e. 4 min after the Troms\u00f8 heater was turned\noff at 19:23 UT. It should be noted that the eigenperiod for\nthe Troms\u00f8 magnetic flux tube is about 4 min (the Alfve\u00b4n\nwave travel time to the magnetic conjugate ionosphere in the\nSouthern Hemisphere and back, along magnetic field line).\nOne might expect that an HF heater turn-off launches an\nAlfve\u00b4n wave and leads to the reverberative echo effect in\nthe HF scattered signals, which should manifest itself about\n4 min later. This effect was discovered by Yampolski (1989)\nin SURA heating experiments.\nWhat is the nature of the continuous and burst-like noise\nenhancements observed from HF Doppler measurements?\nWe have analyzed the magnetic pulsation data recorded near\n 41\n \n \nFigure 4.

By way of illustration Fig. 5 shows the temporal\nbehavior of H , D, and Z components of the magnetic field\nvariations with 0.1-s temporal resolution and their sonogram\n(dynamic frequency spectra) in the frequency band of 5 Hz\non 2 October 1998, from 19:00 to 19:40 UT. One can see the\nappearance of continuous pulsations in the frequency range\nup to 0.8 Hz from 19:23 UT (HF heater turn-off), which can\nbe associated with the Pi1 short-period irregular magnetic\npulsations of the PiC type. Thereafter, against this back-\nground the well-defined burst-like signals at frequencies up\nto 2.4 Hz are recognized from the sonogram. In accordance\nwith classification of magnetic pulsations, these signals are\nidentified as PiB magnetic pulsations. It should be pointed\nout that PiC and PiB magnetic pulsations are observed in\nall components (H , D, Z) of the magnetic field. The com-\nparison between HF Doppler scatter and magnetic pulsation\ndata shows clearly the following. Features in the dynamic\nDoppler spectra of HF diagnostic signals, such as continu-\nous and burst-like noise enhancements, may be attributed to\nPiC and PiB magnetic pulsations, correspondingly. In this\nrespect it is significant that PiB pulsations correspond to the\ntrapping of Alfve\u00b4n wave energy in the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n\nN. F.

Recall that the IAR eigen-\nfrequencies lie within the range 0.1\u201310 Hz; they manifest\nthemselves in the spectra of magnetic pulsations, as well as\nin the electromagnetic noise (Belyaev et al., 1999; Trakht-\nengerts et al., 2000). Therefore, there are reasons to assume\nthat the observed electromagnetic noise, and PiC and PiB\nmagnetic pulsations can be the manifestation of an excita-\ntion of the Alfve\u00b4n vortices trapped in the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n\nresonator.\nThe other distinctive feature in the dynamic Doppler spec-\ntra of the scattered HF signals is the generation of an intense\nwave process with periods of 7\u20138 min. It started at 19:30 UT\nafter the heater was turned on. The observed ionospheric\nwave disturbance is likely be to the signature of short-period\natmospheric gravity waves, AGWs (Hunsucker, 1982). It is\nconceivable that an AGW can be launched by strong heater-\nenhanced electric fields via Joule heating and an indication\nof this has been observed in Arecibo (Thide\u00b4 et al., 1989).\nThereafter, the ionospheric wave process which takes place\nis not dependent on whether the Troms\u00f8 heater is turned on\nor off. At substorm maximum (about 20:00 UT) a large-scale\nionospheric wave disturbance was generated above Troms\u00f8.\nIt was observed throughout the recovery phase of the sub-\nstorm. Its period was more than 45 min (see Fig. 4b). Similar\nwave disturbances are usually considered typical signatures\nof intense magnetospheric substorms and storms.\nInteresting features in the ionospheric plasma parameters\nwere observed by the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar\nat Troms\u00f8, pointing in the magnetic field-aligned direction\n(77\u25e6).

Note that the EISCAT UHF radar was probing in\nthe geomagnetic field-aligned direction. From Fig. 6 one can\nsee very strong Te enhancements, closely related to the con-\nsecutive heater-on periods from 19:00\u201319:08, 19:15\u201319:23,\n19:30\u201319:38, and 19:45\u201319:53 UT. Enhancements in Te were\nobserved over a wide altitude range from 200 to 600 km (the\nupper altitude limit of the EISCAT UHF radar measurements\nin the experiment). It is common knowledge that HF pump-\ninduced electron heating, as well as the excitation of artifi-\ncial field-aligned irregularities (AFAI) and the anomalous ab-\nsorption, is a phenomenon related to the upper hybrid wave.\nIt is generated at the vicinity of the upper hybrid resonance\n(UHR) altitude, where the heater frequency fH is equal to\nthe local upper hybrid frequency, f 2H=f 20 +f 2ce (f0 is the lo-\ncal plasma frequency and fce is the electron gyrofrequency).\nThe UHR height is several kilometers below from the reflec-\ntion level of the HF pump wave. In the course of the exper-\niment on 2 October 1998 very strong electron temperature\nenhancements were observed in a wide altitude range well\nabove the reflection level of the HF waves. Enhancements in\nTe were accompanied by strong Ti increases along with pos-\nitive (upward) ion velocities from altitudes above 350 km.\nThe variations in Te and Ti during the heater on and off\ncycles are stronger under disturbed magnetic conditions than\nunder quiet conditions. There is a good reason to compare\nthe mean values of Te and Ti during heater-on and heater-\noff periods. For this purpose 10-s resolution data from the\nEISCAT UHF radar measurements at altitudes of 315 km\n(near the reflection level of the HF pump wave) and 517 km,\nthat is well above the reflection altitude of the powerful\nHF radio wave, were employed. Calculation results of the\nmeans, the standard deviations, and the standard errors of the\nmeans are summarized in Table 2, where one can see that the\nmeans and standard deviations of the Te and Ti in all heater-\non cycles exceed the same parameters calculated in heater-off\nperiods at both altitudes of 315 and 517 km.\nThe positive Vi , indicative of the generation of upward\nion flows, reached their maximum values (about 400 m\/s\nat the height of 500 km) in the heater-on period from\n19:30\u201319:38 UT, corresponding in time to the substorm on-\nset. Note that the HF pump waves modify significantly the\nionospheric plasma, even after the substorm onset. During\nthe heater-on period, from 19:45 to 19:53 UT there are the\nTe enhancements, as well as a generation of heater-induced\nupward ion flow.\nLarge electron temperature enhancements (a doubling)\nproduced by strong HF pump waves during winter night\nhours were observed at Arecibo (Djuth et al., 1987). These\nTe enhancements were measured in a narrow altitude range\nnear the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) height. Recent ex-\nperimental results from Troms\u00f8 HF pumping experiments\nin the nightside ionospheric F -region during quiet magnetic\nconditions (Rietveld et al., 2003) clearly demonstrate not\nonly extremely strong Te enhancements in a wide altitude\nrange, but also increases in the ion temperatures of about\none hundred degrees and the generation of upward ion flows\n94 N.

Moreover, the\nstrongest pumping effects occurred when the powerful HF\nradio wave is beamed along magnetic field line.\nEven though the HF pumping effects observed in the ex-\nperiment on 2 October 1998 resemble the effects observed\nby Rietveld et al. (2003), there is a clear distinction between\nthem. On 2 October 1998 strong Te increases with altitude\nare measured, especially at the beginning of a heater-on pe-\nriod corresponding to the substorm onset, when Te=2800 K\nat the altitude of h=300 ; they reach the values of Te=5000 K\nat h=500 km.\nThe Ti enhancements most pronounced in the heater-on\nperiods from 19:15\u201319:23 and 19:30\u201319:38 UT may be at-\ntributed to the increase in the ionospheric electric field. In\nthis respect it should be mentioned that a very strong Ti in-\ncrease, accompanied by drastic enhancements in the iono-\nspheric electric field, was observed during the triggering of\nthe local auroral activations when HF pumping was made\ninto the nightside auroral E region (Blagoveshchenskaya et\nal., 2001). A substantial doubling of the southward-pointing\nconvection electric field caused by HF heating was also mea-\nsured from a sounding rocket inside of the Arecibo HF heater\nbeam (Peria and Kelley, 2001).\nThe origin of heater-induced upward ion flows in HF iono-\nspheric modification experiments is not clear. Ion upflow\nevents from EISCAT UHF radar measurements, observed\nnaturally in the F region, can be devided into two types as de-\nscribed by Wahlund et al. (1992). Type I events are related to\nthe strong perpendicular electric field E0, enhanced Ti due to\nfrictional heating and low electron densities (thermal plasma\noutflow). Type II upflows are associated with active auroral\nconditions and increased electron temperatures Te. They may\nbe related to enhanced parallel electric field E|| along mag-\nnetic field-aligned direction caused by anomalous resistivity\ndue to ion acoustic turbulence. Forme and Fontaine (1999)\nhave found that ion acoustic turbulence can greatly increase\nthe electron temperature, leading to the upward ion acceler-\nation by enhanced field-parallel electric field. In the course\nof the experiment on 2 October 1998, carried out during dis-\nturbed background conditions, the occurrence of upward ion\nflows was observed in conjunction with greatly increased\nboth Te and Ti . Moreover, the appearance of ion upflows\nwas accompanied by heater-enhanced ion lines after turn-on\nof the Troms\u00f8 HF heater, which is indicative of ion acous-\ntic turbulence. Heater-enhanced ion lines were measured at\n19:00:05, 19:15:05, and 19:30:05 at altitudes of 303, 267,\nand 248 km, correspondingly. Heater-enhanced ion lines are\nobserved at altitudes in the close vicinity of the reflection\nheight of the powerful HF radio wave. One may speculate\nthat the generation of the heater-driven upward ion flows may\nbe related to the parallel electric field. Nonetheless, we do\nnot exclude the other ion acceleration mechanisms which can\noperate in the HF modified auroral ionosphere.\nSummarizing the experimental findings from the multi-\ninstrument observations in the course of the Troms\u00f8 HF\npumping experiment on 2 October 1998, one can distin-\nguish the following features related to the auroral activation:\n(1) amplification of natural field-aligned irregularities during\nheater-on periods; (2) possible appearance of the reverbera-\ntive echo effect in the HF scattered signals that manifests it-\nself about 4 min (eigenfrequency of the Troms\u00f8L-shell) after\nthe HF heater was turned off; (3) burst-like electromagnetic\nnoise enhancements in the dynamic Doppler spectra of HF\nscattered signals accompanied by PiB magnetic pulsations\nthat can be associated with the trapping of Alfve\u00b4n wave en-\nergy in the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator; (4) strong Te and Ti\nenhancements in a wide altitude range driven by HF pump-\ning; (5) generation of the heater-induced intense upward ion\nflows along the magnetic field lines; (6) strong Te increases\nwith altitude during heater-on period corresponding to the\nsubstorm onset; (7) substorm onset in the southern part of\nthe heated patch under a steady southward Bz component of\nthe IMF.\n4 Distinctive features related to the auroral activations\nIn this section we summarize and compare the distinctive fea-\ntures related to auroral activations from Troms\u00f8 HF pumping\nexperiments in the nightside auroral ionosphere under the re-\nflection of HF pump wave from F2 layer (Sect. 3), as well\nas from the sporadic Es layer (Blagoveshchenskaya et al.,\n2001).\nFirst of all, there is a need to examine the background\ngeophysical conditions during the HF pumping experiments.\nFrom Table 3 one can see that the experiments on 16 and\n17 February 1996 were conducted under slightly disturbed\nmagnetic conditions. The values of the Kp index were about\nKp=2\u20133 and 15\u22646Kp\u226418. During the experiment on 2 Oc-\ntober 1998, the magnetic conditions were disturbed, and val-\nues of the Kp index were Kp=5 and 6Kp=33.\nThe distinctive features related to four auroral activa-\ntions from multi-instrument observations are summarized\nin Table 4.

As it was shown in Sect. 3, there is the as-\nsociation of electromagnetic noise enhancements from HF\nDoppler observations with Pi1 magnetic pulsations. It can be\nindicative of ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator effects (Trakht-\nengerts et al., 2000). What are the possible mechanisms\nneeded for the excitation of ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator\neffects due to unmodulated HF heating of the Earth\u2019s iono-\nsphere? Clearly, to answer this, new theoretical approaches\nand special-oriented experiments are needed.\nThe strong increases of the ion temperatures, as well as\nthe local ionospheric electric fields, observed in all events\nanalyzed can be explained in terms of the theory for non-\nresonant local variations of the macroscopic electric field\ndeveloped by Trakhtengerts et al. (2000). Peria and Kel-\nley (2001) have proposed the ponderomotive force and tem-\nperature gradients, both of which are ubiquitous during HF\nheating, as the candidate mechanisms for the heater-induced\nionospheric electric field.\nModification of the auroral arc and local spiral-like for-\nmation is seen in all experiments under reflection of the HF\npump wave from the sporadic Es layer, see Plates 1 and 2 of\nBlagoveshchenskaya et al. (2001). Unfortunately, the opti-\ncal observations were not carried out when the powerful HF\nradio wave was reflected from F2 layer (experiment on 2\nOctober 1998).\nNevertheless, there are some effects observed only on 2\nOctober 1998, when the F2 layer was overdense, during dis-\nturbed magnetic conditions (see Tables 3 and 4).

Furthermore,\nin the latter experiment, auroral activation occurred in a lo-\ncalized latitudinal region that extends to larger scales with a\nlatitudinal width of 3\u25e6 (see Sect. 3) as compared to the acti-\nvations on 16 and 17 February 1996 (latitudinal width of 1\u25e6)\nobserved by Blagoveshchenskaya et al. (2001).\nStrong electron temperature enhancements and a south-\nward shift of the strongly heated region can apparently be\nexplained by the theory of self-focusing on striations of the\nHF pump wave developed by Gurevich et al. (2001). This\ntheory describes a formation of a large-scale nonlinear struc-\nture along the magnetic field line, consisting of a number of\nbunches of striations (solitons). It is interesting to mention\nthat in experiments at Arecibo, direct measurements of stri-\nations were performed by Kelly et al. (1995). The nonlinear\nstructuring is also manifested in observations (Kelly et al.,\n1995; Franz et al., 1999). It should be pointed out that the\ngeneration of striations and the large-scale nonlinear struc-\nturing at Arecibo is much more difficult than at high latitudes\n(Gurevich et al., 1999).\nIt was shown by Bernhardt et al. (1988) that HF pump-\ninduced ohmic and anomalous heating increases the elec-\ntron temperature and the plasma pressure in the heated patch,\nwhich, in turn, accelerates the plasma along the magnetic\nfield lines. Upward ion flows were predicted by Vas\u2019kov et\nal. (1993) for the Arecibo case based on a model with a soli-\ntary ion-acoustic compression wave propagating along the\nfield-aligned direction. Mingaleva and Mingalev (1997) per-\nformed modelling for conditions of the high-latitudinal iono-\nsphere.\nIn spite of numerous radar and satellite observations of\nion upflows at auroral latitudes, see, for example, Fos-\nter et al. (1998), the initial mechanisms that preheats the\nionospheric ions, which then propagate upward along mag-\nnetic field lines due to the parallel electric field and mirror\nforce, are widely debated. Postulated mechanisms include\n96 N. F. Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: Phenomena in the ionosphere-magnetosphere system\n 45\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8.

Note that mul-\ntiple acceleration processes may be operative along magnetic\nfield lines at different altitudes (Sagawa et al., 1991).\n5 Possible mechanisms for the triggering of auroral ac-\ntivations\nA possible scenario for the substorm triggering due to HF\npumping into the nightside auroral ionosphere along mag-\nnetic field-aligned direction is illustrated by the scheme in\nFig. 7.\nThe accumulation of the energy in the magnetospheric tail\ndue to the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction is accompa-\nnied by an increase in the laminar magnetospheric convec-\ntion. Thermal nonlinear interaction between powerful HF ra-\ndio waves and the auroral ionospheric plasma leads to a local\nincrease in the ionospheric electric field E0 (Blagoveshchen-\nskaya et al., 2001), the excitation of the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n\nresonator (IAR) and low-frequency turbulence. The en-\nhanced currents lead to Alfve\u00b4n wave trapping in the iono-\nspheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator, which is bounded from below by\nthe heater-modified E region and from above by the region\nof a sharp increase in the Alfve\u00b4n velocities at altitudes up to\none Earth radius (Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1991). Mod-\nels predicting changes in the ionospheric conductivity and\nfeedback instability in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system\nwere developed by Lysak (1990, 1991), Trakhtengerts and\nFeldstein (1991), and Stasiewicz et al. (2000).\nHeater-induced low-frequency turbulence leads to a field-\naligned potential drop in the magnetic flux tube, anomalous\nresistivity, and the development of a parallel electric field\nE||. It was found by Haerendel (1990) that the parallel elec-\ntric field may be responsible for the decoupling of the mag-\nnetospheric convection from the ionosphere. The enhanced\nionospheric electric field, the parallel electric field, the turbu-\nlent plasma heating, and the acceleration of runaway charged\nparticles are possible mechanisms for the Alfve\u00b4n wave dissi-\npation in the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator which, in turn,\nleads to the excitation of the turbulent Alfve\u00b4n boundary layer\n(TABL) or, in other words, Alfve\u00b4n vortex instability (AVI) in\nthe IAR (Trakhtengerts and Feldstein, 1991; Trakhtengerts et\nal., 2000). It may serve as a trigger of the auroral activation.\nIt is of interest to estimate possible changes in the iono-\nspheric electric field E0 and the parallel electric field E||\nduring HF pumping experiments at high latitudes. It has\nbeen predicted by Trakhtengerts et al. (2000) that a strong\nlocal increase of E0 can occur near the \u201cnose\u201d of the heater-\nmodified ionospheric region, if the disturbed region is elon-\ngated along the background electric field E0 and the distur-\nbance is large. In this case the amplitude of the electric field\nEm near the nose of the heater-modified ionospheric region\nis of the order of Em\u22483.5E0 (Trakhtengerts et al., 2000),\nwhich is close to that which we observed from the EIS-\nCAT UHF radar measurements in HF heating experiments\n(Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 2001).\nAssuming charge neutrality, Jz can be estimated by\n(Kamide and Baumjohann, 1993)\nJz=1neV||, (2)\nwhere 1n is the change in the electron density, V|| is the\nfield-aligned current velocity, e is the electron charge.\nFigure 8 displays the temporal behavior of the electron\ndensity Ne at an altitude of 300 km, as measured by the\nEISCAT UHF radar during the HF pumping experiment on\n2 October 1998, as well as the calculated values of the\nrelative plasma partial pressure P\/P0 at altitudes of 300\nand 500 km. The condition of the hydrodynamical equilib-\nrium is fulfilled when the partial pressure is kept constant,\nP=Ne(Te + Ti)=const.\nTherefore, the values of P \/P0 can be written as (Gurevich,\n1978)\nP\/P0= Ne(Te + Ti)\nNe0(Te0 + Ti0) , (3)\nwhere Te0, Ti0, and Ne0 are the electron and ion tempera-\ntures, and the electron density before the HF heater is turned\non; Te, Ti , and Ne are the same parameters in the course of\nthe heater-on periods. From Fig. 8 one can see that the hydro-\ndynamical equilibrium has been disrupted due to the effects\nof powerful HF radio waves. The strongest increase in the\nN. F. Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: Phenomena in the ionosphere-magnetosphere system 97\npartial pressure takes place in the heating cycles at 19:15\u2013\n19:23 and 19:30\u201319:38 UT. Furthermore, heater-induced ef-\nfects in the behavior of P \/P0 were observed at the altitudes\nof 300 and 500 km as well.\nWe speculate that there are two electron populations dur-\ning heater-on periods. One of them is the downward field-\naligned current carrying heater-induced runaway electrons\nfrom the ionosphere. The other one is the electron precip-\nitation from the magnetosphere carrying the background up-\nward field-aligned current, responsible for the formation of\nthe substorm current system (Bostro\u00a8m, 1964; Kan, 1993;\nHaerendel, 1990; Kamide and Baumjohann, 1993; Rostoker,\n1999). The presence of two electron populations in HF\npumping experiments is confirmed by direct observations\nfrom the FAST satellite (Robinson et al., 2000). One might\nexpect that the heater-induced runaway electron population\nmay promote the development of current-driven instabilities\nwhich, in turn, leads to the decoupling of magnetospheric\nconvection from the ionosphere. This corresponds to the on-\nset of auroral activation.\nThe field-aligned current velocity V|| can be obtained from\nthe condition of a current convective instability growth (Os-\nsakow and Chaturvedi, 1979)\nV\u2016\nLN\n\u2265 (Te + Ti)k\n2\u2016\nm\u03bde\n\u221a\nM\nm\n\u03bdin\n\u03bden\n, (4)\nwhere m and M , Te and Ti are the electron and ion masses\nand the temperatures, respectively; \u03bden and \u03bdin are colli-\nsion frequencies of electrons\/ions with neutrals; \u03bde=\u03bden+\u03bdei ,\nwhere \u03bdei is the Coulomb collision frequency; LN is a typi-\ncal scale of the perpendicular plasma density gradient; k|| is\nthe field-aligned wave number of irregularities. For V|| cal-\nculations, the Te and Ti values were taken from the EISCAT\nUHF radar measurements. We assume that LN=1. The col-\nlision frequencies \u03bden, \u03bdei , and \u03bde were calculated by taking\ninto account the values of Te, Ne, Nn, and Ni . Calculations\nof the neutral component Nn on 2 October 1998 versus alti-\ntude and time were made by using MSIS-E-90 Model (http:\n\/\/nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov\/space\/model\/models\/msis.html). The\nfield-aligned wave number of irregularities k|| is found, tak-\ning into account the ratio of field-aligned to cross-field scales\nl||\/l\u22a5\u223c2\u00b7103 (Kagan and Frolov, 1996). In the course of our\nexperiments, the bistatic HF Doppler radio scatter used the\n12 095 and 9410 kHz carrier signals from London transmit-\nters and therefore was sensitive to irregularities with spatial\nscales l\u22a5\u224812\u221215 m.\nFrom expression (4) and with the use of the experimental\nvalues of Te=2500\u20133000 K and Ti=1700\u20132500 K at the alti-\ntude of 300 km and Te=3200\u20135000 K and Ti=2000\u20133500 K at\nthe altitude of 500 km, the field-aligned current velocity V||\nis estimated to be in the range 2< V||<4 km\u00b7s\u22121 at h=300 km\nand in the range 5<V||<15 km\u00b7s\u22121 at h=500 km.\nRough estimates of the parallel electric field E|| can be\nmade from the expression (Ginzburg, 1967)\nE|| \u223c m\ne\nV||\n\u221a\n\u03c92 + \u03bd2e\n\u221a\n2m\nM\n, (5)\nwhere V|| is the field-aligned current velocity from Eq. (4), \u03c9\nis the plasma frequency, and m, M , e, and \u03bde are the same as\nin Eq. (4).\nSetting V||=2\u22124 km\u00b7s\u22121 at h=300 km and V||=5\u221215 km\u00b7s\u22121\nat h=500 km for a pump frequency of 4040 kHz, we find\nthat E||=(10\u221215) mV\u00b7m\u22121 at the altitude 300 km and\nE||=(20\u221240)mV\u00b7m\u22121 at the altitude 500 km.\nSummarizing the results of the calculations, one can dis-\ntinguish the following: (1) the hydrodynamical equilibrium\nhas been disrupted due to the effects of HF pumping into\nthe nightside auroral ionosphere; (2) the partial pressure of\nionospheric plasma is about four times higher during the sub-\nstorm onset than the background level just before the HF\nheater was turned on; (3) the parallel electric field can reach\nthe values of the order of E||=30 mV\u00b7m\u22121 during the sub-\nstorm onset at 19:30 UT.\n6 Summary\nWe suggest that the results obtained provide evidence that HF\npumping into nightside auroral ionosphere along the mag-\nnetic field-aligned direction produces a modification of the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. It is expected that a lo-\ncal heater-driven current system is formed which, in turn, un-\nder certain geophysical conditions may cause triggering of\nauroral activations.\nDistinctive features related to auroral activations in the\ncourse of the Troms\u00f8 HF pumping experiments are iden-\ntified. Typical peculiarities observed in all events are the\nfollowing: (1) the generation of burst-like electromagnetic\nnoise observed in bistatic HF Doppler scatter measurements;\n(2) a strong increase in the ion temperature Ti and the local\nionospheric electric field E0; (3) modification of the auro-\nral arc and local spiral-like formation. However, some fea-\ntures were observed only when the HF pump wave was re-\nflected from the F2 layer under disturbed magnetic condi-\ntions. Only the latter experiment shows evidence of strong\nTe increases with altitude, especially during the triggering\nof auroral activation. The generation of the intense upward\nion flows, strong enhancement of the electron temperature\nTe in a wide altitude range (from 200 km to the upper altitude\nlimit of the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar which was\n600 km during experiment) are also observed in this experi-\nment.\nA possible scenario for the substorm triggering due to the\nexcitation of the turbulent Alfve\u00b4n boundary layer (TABL), or\nin other words, Alfve\u00b4n vortex instability (AVI), by an un-\nmodulated HF pump wave in the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n res-\nonator (IAR) is considered. In this respect the potential-\nity of the IAR excitation by an unmodulated HF pump\nwave is discussed. The comparison between electromagnetic\nnoise enhancement from HF Doppler scatter measurements\nand PiC and PiB types of Pi1 magnetic pulsations points\nto an association between them. Taking into account that\nAlfve\u00b4n wave energy can be trapped in the IAR causing PiB\nmagnetic pulsations, the appearance of the burst-like noise\n98 N. F. Blagoveshchenskaya et al.: Phenomena in the ionosphere-magnetosphere system\nenhancement on the Doppler sonogram and PiB magnetic\npulsations can be indicative of ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator\neffects. Clearly, further experiments and new theoretical ap-\nproaches are needed.\nThe enhanced ionospheric electric field, parallel electric\nfield, and turbulent plasma heating are possible mechanisms\nfor Alfve\u00b4n wave dissipation in the IAR that leads to the\nexcitation of the TABL. One would expect that the heater-\ninduced runaway electrons may promote the development of\ncurrent driven instabilities and the formation of an additional\nacceleration region at low altitudes (350\u20131000 km). The hy-\ndrodynamical equilibrium has been disrupted due to effects\nof HF pumping. The partial pressure is about four times\ngreater during the substorm onset than the background level.\nAcknowledgements.
