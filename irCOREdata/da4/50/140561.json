This typically centres on the importance of aligning\ndevelopment with business strategy, gaining high level support, and forging a partnership\nbetween human resources (HR) and line managers (Fulmer and Wagner, 1999; see also\nZenger et al., 2000; Ready and Conger, 2003). Whilst some research into the role of HR in\nemployee development reflects a positive contribution (Gibb, 2001; Murphy and Southey,\n2003), both anecdotal evidence and academic research (Conger and Xin, 2000; Gratton et al.,\n1999; Truss, 2001) indicate that achieving these conditions and approaches in practice can be\nproblematic. Using a case study approach, this paper seeks to illuminate this gap between\ntheory and practice by analysing the activities of human resources\/management development\n(HR\/MD) professionals working in circumstances that do not reflect these high levels of\norganisational support for leadership development.\nCriticisms of management development practice point to; a frequent lack of strategic\nintegration between HR, management development and the business (Mabey and Thomson,\n2000; House and Aditya, 1997; Mabey, 2005); poor evaluation of outcomes (Axel, 1999;\nCairns, 1997; Santos and Stuart, 2003); the over use of competency frameworks (Hayes et al.,\n2000; Conger and Xin, 2000); and concerns about HR\/MD managers being able to act as\ngood role models, to influence the business and to take a strategic overview (Guest and King,\n2004; Meldrum and Atkinson, 1998; Tate, 2004). Perhaps not surprisingly therefore, in a\nrecent CIPD survey of training managers (Sung and Quinn, 2005), only 8 per cent of\nrespondents rated their leadership development as \u201cvery effective\u201d. So, is best practice advice\nfundamentally flawed or is it simply in need of refinement or contextualisation?\nThis question marked the starting point of a research project to provide a critical\nunderstanding of the current state of business leadership development (BLD) and to identify\ndirections for innovative future practice. Our research deliberately focussed on the role of\nbusiness leadership in order to more readily identify the relationship between leadership\ndevelopment and business performance. The research results of Phase One, based on a\nsample of 103 managers in 20 UK organisations, are reported elsewhere (Clarke et al., 2004;\nClarke and Bailey, 2002) but in summary revealed the extent to which BLD in practice is an\nunfocussed and extremely diffuse activity. It was also not evaluated well and poorly aligned\nto business needs. This malaise was the product of four interrelated factors: aligning BLD\nstrategy to HR best practice rather than medium\/long-term business needs, lack of senior\nmanagement vision for BLD, poor quality HR thinking, and differing agendas and\norganisational politics; that when combined, created \u201cCatch 22\u201d situations where successful\ndevelopment is fundamentally undermined by mutually limiting constraints. For example,\nattempts to make better organisational use of BLD are restricted when senior managers have\na limited view of its value, a view that is only likely to change through their own experience\nof BLD.\nIn response to this widespread lack of coherence of approach, phase two of the research\nprogramme sought to understand how those involved in BLD made sense of their situation\nand came to decisions about strategy and action, that enabled them to overcome this complex\nset of unfavourable circumstances. This involved a large-scale international survey of views\nand BLD practice and the qualitative analysis of cases of successful and innovative BLD\nactivity derived from phase one data. A case methodology was selected on the grounds that\nthis research method most readily lent itself to the inductive aspect of phase two and is\nparticularly useful where theory development is weak (Harrison, 2002).\nThese cases form the basis of this paper. A companion paper (Bailey and Clarke, 2008)\nexplores the first two of the four barriers to effective BLD and focuses on the issue of\nachieving business relevance in BLD and the quality of HR\/MD strategy formulation. This\nsecond paper investigates the final two barriers that are concerned with the influence of\ncompeting political agendas on BLD and how Human resource development (HRD)\nprofessionals work within this context. In both of these papers we adopt a critical realist\nperspective (Bhaskar, 1974) in which organisation, structure culture and strategy are seen to\nco-exist but act independently of each other (Chia, 2002; Fairclough, 2005). This perspective\nreadily lends itself to analysing the relations between the unobservable, casual or generative\nmechanisms (of effective BLD) and their observable effects (Chia, 2002; Blaikie, 1993;\nPartington, 2002). In particular, this perspective encourages speculation about \u201cplausible,\nunderstandable cognitive processes\u201d (Partington, 2002, p. 141) that mediate between the\nrecognition of unfavourable organisational circumstances and the resulting action. Based on\nthis perspective we present two contributions. First, we draw some tentative conclusions\nabout the broad personal dispositions, behaviours and activities that enable HRD\nprofessionals to positively influence the design and delivery of BLD in their organisation in\ndifficult circumstances. Second, following Buchanan (1999), we also present these qualitative\ncases as vehicles for personal learning; written as potential \u201cclassroom\u201d cases we hope that\nthey can be used to stimulate debate about the role of HR\/professionals in leading change in\nBLD. Practical guidance for HRD professionals struggling to make a difference in similar\nsituations is provided and potential areas for further research are identified.\nPower and politics in HRD\nThe organisation case analysis in the companion paper (Bailey and Clarke, 2008) highlights\nthe importance of five factors in shaping successful BLD strategy; linking BLD strategy to\nbusiness need, linking development method to business need, clarity and communication\nabout the role of management development, taking a discriminating approach toward\nevaluation and the criticality of individual leadership. This final factor is of particular interest\nto HRD professionals seeking to generate and implement BLD strategy. BLD has long been\nconsidered a traditional remit of the HRD function, yet as our initial research revealed, many\nHRD professionals struggle to make a real impact because they get caught in \u201cCatch 22\u201d\nsituations where development is fundamentally undermined by mutually limiting constraints.\nThis appears to contrast with generalised accounts of best practice leadership development\nwhere senior management ownership and accountability are attained but where insufficient\nreference is made to how this is practically achieved (see for example, Ready and Conger,\n2003).\nThe companion paper also indicates, in line with the view of others (Sheehan, 2005;\nNovicevic and Harvey, 2004) that political savvy might well be a significant factor in how\nthose leading leadership development are able to make a difference in such unfavourable\ncircumstances. There is now a growing body of literature about the constructive role of\npolitics in management and leadership (Buchanan and Badham, 1999; Butcher and Clarke,\n2002; Ammeter et al., 2002). From this perspective, politics is seen as a valuable process for\nresolving the inevitable differences of organisation life (Butcher and Clarke, 2002). However,\nas yet there has been insufficient attention given to the enactment of micro politics in the\nevery day work of HRM professionals (Ferris and Judge, 1991; Galang and Ferris, 1997) and\nin leadership in general (House and Aditya, 1997; Ray et al., 2004). There are two possible\nexplanations for this.\nFirst, politics have traditionally been viewed with some ambivalence by managers regardless\nof functional perspective (see Buchanan and Badham, 1999, for a comprehensive literature\nreview of this issue). For example, organisation politics has attracted widely divergent\nopinions, ranging from its description as \u201cgame playing, snide, them and us, aggressive,\nsabotaging, negative, blaming, win-lose, withholding, non-co-operative behaviour\u201d (Stone,\n1997, p. 1) to \u201ca disarmingly charming and engaging manner that inspires confidence, trust,\nsincerity and genuineness\u201d (Perrewe et al., 2000, p. 117). Faced with this level of\ncontradiction it is understandable if HR managers view politics with some scepticism. We\nwere therefore interested to identify the extent to which political considerations were\nreflected in the activity of HRD professionals, who, working in conditions unfavourable to\ncoherent BLD, were nevertheless able to make progress.\nA further explanation might lie in the fact that HR norms and values have traditionally been\nfirmly rooted in a unitary mindset (Gratton et al., 1999; Caldwell, 2003; Guest and King,\n2004) and the acceptance of a plurality of interests implicit in political activity runs counter\nto this unitary approach. This is seen to affect both the output of management learning and\nthe basis on which HR\/MD interventions are constructed. For Burgoyne and Jackson (1997),\na unitary perspective oversimplifies the process of management learning by excluding many\nof the cognitive, symbolic and political aspects of management development activity. This\nhas led to the situation where too many management development initiatives have failed to\nmake an impact because they have focussed on an idealised notion of what should be\nhappening rather than factoring in the complexities of the people involved. Perhaps more\nfundamentally, such a unitary perspective also tends to emphasis values of \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and\n\u201cbest practice\u201d and discourages consideration of the value of a wider range of resources that\ncan be utilised by HR managers to affect change (Francis, 2002). These factors may have\ncombined to make the discussion of political behaviour in an HR context an illegitimate issue\nfor practitioners. For example, in Murphy and Southey's (2003) research into the role of HR\npractitioners on the introduction of innovative practice, political influence was not judged to\nbe significant.\nIn phase one of our research, however, political activity was evident at all levels of BLD\nactivity. BLD was hotly contested territory because it reflected fundamental issues of\norganisation control (Coopey, 1995; Francis, 2002). For example, managers often accounted\nfor the lack of any coherent approach to BLD through observations such as:\nThe organization is too fragmented with autonomous factions, often in competition with each\nother and hence currently no integrated strategy (John, Drinkco).\nPeople try to grow others in their own image, and protect their own patch. They do not want\nto risk losing good people through development activities like job rotation (James,\nPharmaco).\nTruss (2001) suggests that the changing nature of organisation boundaries and the increasing\nsignificance of such informal organisational predispositions have rendered the traditional\nfunctional approach to HR redundant. Mabey (2002) argues for more investigation into how\nknowledge is created and diffused without assuming corporate and individual interests are\naligned. In a similar vein, Skinner and Mabey (1997) note the need for more research into the\nrealities of HR directors and middle managers at all stages of the organisation change\nprocess.\nTo what extent then, do HRD professionals engage in political activity counter to the\nprofessions traditional unitarist viewpoint? If they do, what does this look like in practice?\nThere has been much discussion in the human resource management (HRM) literature about\na gap between the reality of HRM activity and its rhetorical underpinnings (Legge, 1995;\nFrancis, 2002), in which mangers use HRM rhetoric to engage in the persuasive construction\nof an organisational reality that is used to subvert individual organisational experience.\nConventional rhetoric regarding HR and leadership development tends to reflect the value of\npartnerships (Fulmer and Wagner, 1999) and shared ownership (Ready and Conger, 2003)\nbetween HR and line managers striving towards a single unifying goal (Caldwell, 2003). In\ncontrast individual experience is often reported in terms of political behaviour characterised\nby covert action, conflict, negotiation and divergent agendas (Butcher and Clarke, 2001).\nBased on the above analysis we propose that in unfavourable circumstances, those HRD\nprofessionals who reflect a leadership orientation are likely to adopt political behaviours in\norder to successfully implement BLD strategy. Unfavourable circumstances are defined here\nas situations in which there was evidence of confusion about the role of BLD or that there\nwas a lack of an agreed strategic priority toward BLD. We define political behaviour as\n\u201cthose deliberate efforts made by individuals and groups in organizations to use power in the\npursuit of their own particular interests\u201d (Butcher and Clarke, 2001, p. 18). Power in this\nregard is viewed as situational and relational, derived from a plurality of sources and widely\ndistributed, rather than simply a commodity possessed by a small number of individuals or\ngroups (Burgoyne and Jackson, 1997; Swan et al., 2002).\nCase methodology\nOur aim in constructing the cases presented here was to select a small number of examples,\nnot on the basis of representativeness, but on their potential for learning (Buchanan, 1999).\nRather than seeking generalisability at the level of populations, it was intended that the\nqualitative data would facilitate an explanation about the structure, process and drivers of\nindividual action in these circumstances. Our sample was taken from the original phase one\npopulation of 103 managers; the companion paper (Bailey and Clarke, 2008) details the\nresearch methodology used to generate this data. A total of 17 HR\/HRD managers were\ninterviewed in this sample.\nIn phase one of the research we identified a number of leadership capabilities that were\nconsidered critical for future-oriented leadership (see Table I). This list of future leadership\ncapabilities was used as the basis for identifying those managers who demonstrated some\nlevel of leadership orientation.\nIndividuals were selected on the basis that their interview data reflected at least two thirds of\nthese capabilities. This percentage was chosen on the assumption that \u201cperfect leaders\u201d are\nrare. We based our analysis on the content of each HRD professional's own account of BLD\npractice in their organisation, triangulated with the accounts of other managers in the same\norganisation before selecting them for detailed analysis.\nThe organisations in which these 17 managers worked were assessed, again, from the initial\ninterview data, to identify the extent to which they reflected unfavourable circumstances.\nBased on a content analysis of the different accounts used to construct the original\norganisation case studies (see Bailey and Clarke, 2008) we were able to obtain clear\nindicators of the relative confusion or disagreement about BLD. Only six individuals from the\nseventeen managers interviewed met the first criteria and only two met both. However, in\nreviewing the data from phase one, a further c\npostal questionnaire that was used to test the generalisability of the original interview data.\nThis case also met the above selection criteria, albeit without the additional company data\navailable in the first two cases.\nFollow up, semi-structured interviews with all three individuals, were used to explore, clarify\nand validate points about context and activity arising from the original semi\ninterview data or questionnaire. As with the original data\ndesirable responses was minimised by assuring confidentiality and anonymity and\njudgemental responses avoided. Each individual case was then content analysed for evidence\nof political behaviour using standard practices\nHuberman (1994; Milliken et al.\nthe degree to which these individuals recognised a plurality of interests and influence\nin the formulation and execution of BLD, some active assessment of its impact on the\nimplementation of BLD and their degree of willingness to work, either overtly or covertly\nwith this diversity of interest in order to achieve an outcome which they\nbeneficial. The extent to which the resulting outcomes could be described as beneficial to\nthemselves or others was based on a combination of interview data gleaned from across their\norganisation and\/or documentary evidence such as post program\nindividuals concerned were given an opportunity to critique\/comment on the content of their\ncase. Apart from a few points of detail, none of these observations necessitated substantive\nrevisions.\nEach case study below provides back\norganisation and how they have succeeded in implementing their interesting, stimulating, and\nat times, radical ideas about management development and business leadership in\nunfavourable circumstances.\nJavier\nJavier worked for four years as the Training and Development manager in a substantial\ninternational engineering consultancy, which at the time of researching, had grown to around\n3,000 employees and had a turnover of over \u00a3150 million. Much of this growth\nachieved through mergers and acquisitions, which over time produced an extremely diverse\norganisation. Overall however, the organisation had a conservative and hierarchical culture.\nThere was considerable commitment to high service levels but a ge\nhampered by a predisposition to concentrate on technical\/product issues. In Javier's view, this\nase was identified from data collected from a\ncollection, the tendency for socially\nfor qualitative data described by\n, 2003; Harrison, 2002). Political behaviour was assessed by\nconsidered\nme appraisals. The three\nground information about the individual, their\nnuine customer focus was\n-structured\nMiles and\nat work\nhad been\nhelped to engender a short-term cost focus and meant that the organisation was in need of a\ndifferent kind of leadership, one that was capable of generating a longer-term vision about\nwhere it was going.\nFrom Javier's perspective this was not fertile ground for BLD. Only two of the main board\nhad any management development themselves and training and development was an easy\narea for cost reduction. Until Javier's arrival, BLD had taken place on a slow drip feed basis\nand because of the sise of the organisation, was having very little impact. It is not surprising\nthat Javier initially found that trying to raise the profile of BLD in these circumstances was\n\u201clike wading through sludge\u201d. Despite these unfavourable circumstances he has clearly had a\nsignificant impact on leadership development, attributable to a number of activities.\nFirst, by networking with a small group of \u201clike-minded\u201d senior managers he began to extend\nhis power base and to position BLD as a real lever of organisation improvement. Despite the\nlack of commitment from the board, Javier and his close colleagues tried to ensure that:\nthe company takes a three to five year view on management development and becomes very\nrobust about pushing people through the whole organisation \u2026 and this includes having a\ngroup board development process which will challenge any fixed mindsets that they might\nhave \u2026\nSecond, because of the overall lack of support for BLD, Javier recognised the need to work\noutside of his formal sphere of authority, albeit at some personal risk. For example, with the\ngeneral intent of building organisational recognition of the need for change, he helped to\nchampion a key customer relationship survey. While overtly interested in the potential\ntraining implications, his real motive was to ensure that the critical absence of an effective\ncustomer focus was revealed by the survey, as this would enable him to stimulate debate\nabout the need for substantial change.\nThird, Javier was able to opportunely \u201cpiggyback\u201d legitimate organisational initiatives and\nthen shape them for other purposes. For example, when, in the face of rapidly declining\nmargins the company initiated a restructuring exercise, Javier turned the opportunity to his\nadvantage. Using the need to train the appointees in their new organisational roles, Javier was\nable to build a case for a much larger development budget than would have otherwise been\nsanctioned. He also shaped the development process so that it not only equipped this cadre of\nsenior managers with new role capabilities, but also helped to develop a new approach to\nleadership in the business. He worked closely with the external provider to ensure that\ncontentious issues were surfaced and to involve the main board in the actual programmes.\nThis was not simply so as to demonstrate executive level support but to expose executives to\nthe emerging issues and for them to take some responsibility for the development process. By\nworking in this way he has moved well beyond fulfilling a managerial role in BLD and\nactively led the leadership development agenda.\nFinally, it is apparent that Javier had a real motivation to make a difference to his\norganisation. He believes leaders need to be able to take risks to do this:\nbeing prepared to say when things are not right, to challenge opinions and not just tow the\ncompany line \u2026 be able to develop vision \u2026 where do we need to be in five to ten years time\nand how do we need to re-organise to get there. To do that requires self-discipline, being able\nto make the time and to get others to help develop that vision \u2026\nClearly, Javier had the discipline to make time for this himself. Sensing that in the future he\nwould need yet more business acumen to further his cause, he completed an MBA and was\nconsidering a move to customer relationship management, as he believed that this would\nprovide more opportunity for making a difference to his organisation.\nThere was evidence that his work was having an impact. He convinced senior management to\ncontinue investing in the high profile development programme despite cost pressures. As a\nresult of the first programme, participants initiated a debate about the need for greater\ninvolvement in the corporate strategy-making process and individuals were able to pursue\nthis theme in their own business units through their own personal leadership. Some six to 12\nmonths after the programme managers were surveyed about its value to the business; they\nbelieved overwhelmingly that it had been influential in building support for the changes in\nleadership focus that Javier had anticipated. Three quarters of the participants believed it had\nmade real impact on the company.\nJavier is certainly working in commonly encountered unfavourable circumstances. He is,\nhowever, demonstrating many future oriented leadership characteristics. He is confident\nenough in his own vision for BLD and has networked with a small number of like-minded\nsenior colleagues to create a legitimate mandate for this. He is comfortable with taking risks,\nmaking the best use of opportunities, like that afforded by the restructuring, to help shape\norganisational activities to his coalition's purposes. He is also taking risks by deliberately\nusing projects such as the customer survey to acclimatise the organisation to change, albeit\nthat such projects do not formally lie within the boundaries of his authority. His success\nappears to be more readily related to a reliance on these capabilities rather than gaining high-\nlevel management buy-in and financial support.\nFelix\nFelix began his career as an aeronautical engineer before moving into Personnel. At the time\nof writing he was working in a HRD role, first, for one of the organisations major subsidiaries\nand then later in an international project role. His employer, a globally branded business, is\nrepresented in 40 countries and comprises many autonomous businesses with different\nmarkets. This diversity was the cause of pressure from investors, calling for the business to\njustify their broad portfolio and to demonstrate a greater level of synergy from its global\noperations.\nThis organisational context created a wide diversity of agendas. It has also created ambiguity\nabout the nature and role of HR\/MD and consequently affected the degree of financial\nsupport it attracted. There was no clear and formal strategy for BLD across the whole\norganisation. From Felix's perspective:\nI don't think people would say that leadership isn't important, but there isn't necessarily a\nbelief that good business leadership is developed through what people would see as normal\ndevelopment processes.\nThis lack of understanding about the nature and potential of BLD became an issue when\nFelix was asked, as a result of the push for greater global synergies, to take on a project to\ncreate a corporate approach to succession planning for senior executives. On the one hand\nthere was a desire to institute greater levels of consistency, on the other, a strong tradition of\nindividual development and local autonomy in BLD. Felix anticipated the imposition of a\ntop-down approach resulting in great resentment:\nMaintaining a balance between top-down inspired activities and bottom-up individualised\ndevelopment is important. We need to be able to hold back top-down initiatives to enable\npockets of good practice to occur if development is to take place in which people develop a\nsense of their own ability to influence things.\nThe distinguishing feature of Felix's leadership approach was his ability to network; building\nrelationships that allowed him to read the diverse agendas around him, noting potential\nsources of resistance and leveraging mutual interests in pursuit of good organisational causes.\nIn this example, his understanding of these competing agendas helped him to arrive at a\nworkable solution. For example, his skill was critical in identifying supporters for his\napproach:\nWhat we were doing was taking a \u201cpockets of good practice\u201d approach \u2026 here we are with a\nbig non-homogenous organization, and my approach was to establish some development\nprinciples in a number of places in the business. Actually I couldn't care less where those\nplaces were, so let's go with where the energy is to do it. That could be driven by a number of\nthings \u2013 a business unit head who just believed that this was the way to do it or in the case of\nEurope, it was business-driven because of significant growth and real concern over the\ncapability of the people to respond (emphasis added).\nThus by networking extensively and by understanding \u201cwhere the energy is to do it\u201d, Felix\nwas able to build a groundswell of support for an approach to BLD based on common\nprinciples without having to rely on unacceptable levels of top-down policy.\nThis skill was particularly important in managing upwards too. Like Javier, Felix was happy\nto take some risks with his solution but recognised that this \u201cpockets\u201d approach appealed to\nhis line manager, the HR director who \u201cdidn't want to rock the boat \u2026 he was quite a\npolitical player, and so it was quite easy to persuade him to go where there was already a few\nsupporters\u201d. On the other hand, the solution was somewhat at odds with the Chief Executive's\npreferred approach and because of that, Felix took a risk in deciding to delay involving him:\nOne of the obvious routes was to go to the Chief Executive, particularly given that he was\nunder some pressure from his boss to do some of this [top-down] stuff, and say \u201cthis is the\nprocess we are following, please endorse this\u201d. So there was some stealth in deciding not to\ngo down that route. Using the \u201cpockets\u201d route instead I was able to delay the approach to him\nuntil the principles had been established and their effectiveness proved so that we didn't have\nto resort to a top-down approach that might alienate people.\nThis approach to the succession planning project again reflected sensitivity to the range of\norganisation circumstances and an ability to read and take account of others views. It\ninvolved getting the senior groups in each region to identify the critical roles and posts and\nthereby achieve some clarity about how their business worked, who the company was most\ndependent upon and by implication which roles and people required attention. Formal\nmeetings took place to talk about employees potential and progression, but this was combined\nwith a more informal and flexible mechanism of determining development that enabled a\nswift response when things needed to be done immediately. The approach was effective\nbecause once again Felix had been able to identify why it was in the interests of key players\nto make it work.\nLike the other individuals in the case studies, Felix's approach to this project was\nunderpinned by personal clarity about the nature of leadership development:\nIt's quite possible that in the future individuals will want the power to tailor-make their\nrelationship with their employers \u2013 for example working from home. Businesses are probably\nhappy to start doing this but will want something in return \u2013 employees who are competent\nand capable in what they are doing. This means that the individual will need to take\nresponsibility for their own development. Development has been corporate-sponsored but is\nnow becoming more individual-focused. This means that BLD strategy will need to focus on\nmatching individuals to opportunities. People will want good projects and good jobs as that's\nwhere the learning, development and building capabilities will come from.\nWhether or not these ideas will prove to be correct is of course open to debate, one in which\nFelix was happy to engage. However he had a clear vision for development and combined\nwith his relationship building capabilities, was able to lead effectively in addressing BLD\nissues. He was confident to take personal risks in the way, for example, he positioned his\nsuccession planning project, delaying the chief executive's formal involvement in order to\nbuild support from within the business. This was an unusual decision given that \u201cgaining\nsenior management commitment\u201d is usually the first prescribed port of call in managing\nchange, but nevertheless, one that actually helped secure agreement to his plan. The\nambiguity and uncertainty of this complex set of organisational relationships appeared to be\nno barrier to the effectiveness of his activities.\nThe project was successfully implemented with a high degree of organisation buy-in, without\nthe need for inappropriate levels of central policy. This was achieved in no small measure,\nthrough Felix's leadership. After working for the company for two years, Felix was ready for\nhis next leadership challenge and took up an HR director's role in a high profile and growing\nbusiness.\nChristian\nAt the time of the research, Christian worked as an HRD director with new product\ndevelopment responsibilities for a UK-based financial software company for which he had\nworked for six years, initially as quality manager.\nWith the emergence of financial e-business solutions the company was under considerable\npressure to improve its new product development (NPD) process. However, as a relatively\nsmall independent player the company could not hope to compete with the major software\nhouses in terms of R&D. The organisation's strategy was therefore to spot trends early in\ntheir cycle and then respond quickly to these or as Christian described \u201cspotting the waves\nand surfing them while they last\u201d, \u2013 \u201cwe can't create the waves we can only surf them\u201d. In\ntheory, this approach would play to the strengths of a relatively small organisation but would\nrequire agile processes and nimble leadership. However, over the last few years in an effort to\nbuoy up the profit margin much of the people development work to sustain this agility had\nbeen neglected. Functional silos had developed to protect \u201cturf\u201d and because of the directive\nand autocratic approach taken by the chief executive, risk taking and change had been\nreduced to a minimum. In this environment BLD had not been seen as a priority, and most\ndevelopment investment was simply viewed as a cost by the dominant chief executive and\nfinance director coalition.\nDespite these unfavourable circumstances Christian saw the potential for BLD to have a\npositive impact on the organisation. He tried many ways of convincing his colleagues as to its\nvalue but with little success and with only a limited budget he settled on an unconventional\napproach. His plan was to seed the organisation with capable individuals who could influence\nchange from the bottom-up by:\ndeveloping a cadre of people who have a level of knowledge and a level of understanding, \u2026\n[and] \u2026 the internal environment that allows them to push the status quo, to change the\nbusiness, \u2026 so it challenges the traditional hierarchy of the organisation \u2013 because the\ninternal cadre will basically be leading and developing organisational change.\nSuch an approach is at odds with much conventional thinking about initiating organisation\nchange but reflects a \u201cpocket of good practice\u201d approach, similar to that pursued by Felix.\nGiven this strategy, the need for immediate action and limited financial backing, Christian\nwas highly selective about who he involved by focussing on those who clearly had the talent,\nambition and energy to make things happen. First, he selected a small number of like minded\nsenior colleagues to receive high quality external leadership development who, once back in\nthe organisation, would be encouraged to act as role models of change leadership. Second, he\nestablished a middle management development programme overtly aimed at improving cross\norganisation working but which, under Christian's leadership, had other ambitions. In order to\ninitiate change from below, the programme involved a strong personal development focus to\nequip the managers with the confidence that they could make things happen despite the\norganisation. In attempting to catalyse this change he needed managers who could:\nget out of their mindsets, let go of the past and employ inductive reasoning.\nThe success of this bottom-up strategy was very much dependent on Christian's personal\nleadership. Based on interview data collected from participants on the programme it is clear\nthat he put into practice his own views about the nature of leadership:\nI think people with charisma tend to be able to set \u2026 [a] \u2026 vision and really sell the vision,\nthey tend to be able to motivate people without putting quite as much effort into it and they're\nable to make people feel a lot more special than the old typical command and control leaders.\nTo create a nimble organization, you need leaders with that element of charisma.\nIn this way he personally led the middle management development process and mentored and\ncoached key individuals as they tried to implement the ideas from the programme. He was\nable to build a sense of camaraderie and cohesion amongst the group that gave them\nconfidence. He was also careful to protect this emerging confidence from what he saw as\n\u201coutside interference\u201d nurturing their action learning projects until they were sufficiently\nestablished to withstand criticism and scrutiny.\nLike the other two examples above, Christian was not always upfront about some of his\nactivities, as he believed they would not gain open support. For example, certain initiatives\nwere disguised under non-training budget codes. Similarly, he was not explicit about his\nmotive to get non-executive directors to become mentors for senior managers. In reality, as\nwell as helping his senior managers, he hoped the process would provide greater legitimacy\nfor development activities.\nAlso like Javier and Felix, Christian was an excellent networker and relationship builder,\ngathering support for his actions in an often-hostile environment. Above all else perhaps, he\ndemonstrated a real willingness to challenge the status quo and take personal risks. In\neschewing conventional approaches to BLD by building from the bottom-up and being highly\nselective, he was nevertheless able to produce tangible results. The carefully selected senior\nmanagers who attended the external leadership programme were able to tackle change\nmanagement projects that had, as one of them described, \u201cbeen put in the too hard basket\u201d.\nThese projects enabled the company to reduce costs and streamline customer relationship\nprocesses with the effect of improving customer relationships and decreasing complaints\ndramatically.\nAs for the ultimate goal of improving NPD, Christian's actions came too late. The company\nwas taken over and asset stripped. Christian, however, had made a difference. Whilst the\nchief executive and finance director were not employed by the new owner, Christian was\nretained to help with the merger.\nEmerging themes\nThese three individuals were selected because, in their approach to BLD, they reflected many\nof the attributes required for future business leadership \u2013 qualities of future thinking, risk\ntaking, and so on. They were also selected on the basis that they would provide insight about\nthe broad personal dispositions that enable managers to make progress in situations where\nthere was confusion or lack of agreement about the strategic value of BLD. In all three cases\nthe managers were clearly conscious about the importance of power in assessing and working\nwith the plurality of interests at work in BLD. This included an ability to read competing and\npotentially beneficial organisational agendas and to use these as a basis for building support.\nFor example, Felix used the discovery of different business needs from around the company\nto build an agenda for his actions. An understanding of key agendas also meant that\nsometimes the managers felt it necessary to be covert about their activities in the long-term\ninterests of the organisation. These practices, such as Christian disguising expenditure under\ndifferent budget codes, are of course in direct contravention to many popular ideas about\nopenness and collaboration in contemporary organisations (see for example, Cloke and\nGoldsmith, 2002).\nThe use of power and politics as a process for the reconciliation of competing interests was\nevident in three ways: in the approach to relationship management, challenge and critique and\nin building change from the bottom-up.\nRelationship management\nEach individual clearly placed a premium on relationship building and networking, across, up\nand down his or her respective organisations. This provided a rich source of power and social\ncapital for each manager (Murphy and Southey, 2003; Collins and Clark, 2003). Whether this\nwas Christian using non-executive directors to promote his cause or Javier working on\ncustomer relationship activities, they did not appear to feel constrained by hierarchy or their\nformal responsibilities in the way they formed these relationships. For example, Javier and\nFelix were able to get the support of their sponsor\/manager and a few other key influencers,\nbut Christian built the same support amongst his peers without the formal backing of his boss.\nIn these ways, each individual ensured the relevance of their agendas and goals and that they\nwere balanced with what was perceived to be broader organisational needs, even though in\nmany respects their ideas clashed with the dominant priorities at that time. A more\nconventional approach may have been to either substantially reshape their initiative to gain\ngreater senior management acceptability, and thus reduce its business impact, or, to simply\nhave dropped the idea altogether in favour of easier pickings.\nChallenge and critique\nIn contrast to a more traditional managerial approach to BLD, each of the three individuals\nwas proactive in challenging and questioning their organisation's strategy (or lack of), but\nalso had clear well thought out alternatives. In this way each manager demonstrated a certain\nlevel of organisational irreverence (Butcher and Atkinson, 2001); a preparedness to critique\nand work counter to conventional norms and behaviours. For example, Christian deliberately\nseeded change lower down the organisation to challenge his organisation's approach to\nhierarchy. Irreverence was also evident in the way Felix held back the pressure for top-down\ninitiatives and built a power base from the bottom-up and in the way Javier surfaced\ncontentious issues in his development programme in order to stimulate critical debate. This\nirreverence echoes Legge and Exley's (1975) proposition that such deviant innovation can be\na source of influence. This is derived from an ability to reframe values or conventions, often\nby reference to groups or benchmarks \u201cexternal\u201d to those being influenced such as in the way\nJavier used data from the customer survey to promote his agenda for BLD.\nBuilding change from the bottom up\nThere is now a growing body of literature that promotes the effectiveness of change\ninitiatives inspired by small homogeneous groups located at lower organisational levels.\nThese have been described as \u201chot groups\u201d (Lipman-Blumen and Leavitt, 1999) or\n\u201ccommunities of good practice\u201d (Brown and Duguid, 1991). Such groups may be either\nformally recognised teams or units or they may simply spring from networks across an\norganisation. Whatever their form they are characterised by a purpose and intention to\ninnovate, affirm or modify theories in use and act as role models to spread knowledge and\nnew rules for action (Hendry, 1996). This emerging approach to change can be equally if not\nmore effective than traditional top-down approaches (see Hamel, 2000) as it builds on real\npersonal interests and aligns them with live organisational issues.\nThe three individuals described here worked with a bottom-up approach, building change\nwithout explicit senior management approval, either in order to gain support or avoid senior\nmanagement opposition. For example, Felix expressly built his methodology in line with\n\u201cwhere the energy is\u201d and resisted the opportunity to use a top-down approach in\ncontravention of conventional best practice change management. Similarly, Christian selected\na cadre of middle managers to \u201cinitiate change from below\u201d and Javier networked with a\nsmall number of \u201clike-minded managers\u201d to implement his vision for BLD.\nWe defined politics as \u201cthose deliberate efforts made by individuals and groups in\norganisations to use power in the pursuit of their own particular interests\u201d (Butcher and\nClarke, 2001, p. 18). This definition suggests a preoccupation with self-serving outcomes,\nwhich is not borne out by the cases. It is apparent that each person was motivated by a\npersonal view about leadership and the way their organisation needed to work in the future.\nIn the absence of any coherence from above they created their own vision for the activity.\nThey each displayed a belief that they could make a difference despite the formal opposition\noften arrayed against them. Nor did they wait for permission or formal support. Rather than\nrely on formal organisation authority or power they sought and used the opportunity to\ninfluence the direction of their organisation regardless of their position or context. However,\nin doing so, each individual appeared to be attempting to balance their individual interests\nwith those of other influential groups, either at senior levels or lower down the organisation.\nPoints for reflection and action\nTo what extent then do these case studies contribute to or contradict existing research in this\narea? First, although these cases were specifically chosen because they reflected a degree of\nconfusion or disagreement about BLD, we believe that these themes suggest that, at the very\nleast, much best practice advice on leadership development needs to be tempered with an\nacknowledgement of the degree to which it is subject to competing interests (Burgoyne and\nJackson, 1997; Novicevic and Harvey, 2004). This raises questions as to the efficacy of\nunitary values to be found in much of the HR best practice literature (Caldwell, 2003). Ready\nand Conger (2003) suggest that the pursuit of sectional interests constitutes one of several\npathologies that lead to the death of leadership development activity. Their solution is to\ndevelop shared ownership, but in the situations described here, that would have constituted an\nidealistic aspiration. Instead, embracing the sectional interests at work, to gain at least\ntemporary organisational momentum, proved to be a valuable approach to overcoming the\npolitical barriers to effective BLD.\nHowever, when set alongside unitary notions of organising, political processes are seen as\nillegitimate. Indeed, much of the trio's behaviour was close to the edge of \u201cacceptable\u201d\nactivity and might only be construed as \u201cprincipled\u201d because the three individuals appeared\nto have taken care to build a mandate that was justifiable to others. This approach very much\nsupports Buchanan's (1999) notion of a \u201clogic of political action\u201d in which individuals\naccount for their actions according to the extent to which they can be considered to contribute\nto organisational outcomes, maintain their reputation and are able to justify these actions to\nthemselves and others. There was a candid honesty about their motives to be stealthy or\ncovert in their actions. Indeed, the managers did not seek to explain their behaviour according\nto unitary notions of \u201cbest practice\u201d (Francis, 2002), but actually embraced the plurality of\ninterests at play in their companies. These examples suggest that if such processes can be\nlegitimated by association with organisational outcomes, they can provide scope for\nconflicting perceptions and dissent to be aired in the interests of organisational learning rather\nthan simply the pursuit of sectional interests (Coopey and Burgoyne, 2000). For example,\nFelix, by working behind the scenes with his development provider, was able to raise difficult\nissues in a formal learning environment attended by board members. This approach is\nredolent of Burgoyne and Jackson's (1997) \u201carena thesis\u201d in which management learning is\nseen as a domain in which \u201cconflicting purposes and values \u2026 meet to be refined, reconciled\nor proliferated\u201d (Burgoyne and Jackson, 1997, p. 61), and Reynolds' (2000, p. 71) notion of\ncommunities as a \u201cpolitics of difference\u201d.\nThe cases also shed light on other types of behaviour that may enable HRD professionals to\novercome the criticisms, evident in the literature, of insufficient influence, poor innovation\nand lack of integration and linkage with the business. For example, Fulmer and Wagner\n(1999) highlight the importance of ensuring leadership development attracts high level\nsupport and Murphy and Southey (2003) the positive impact of a legitimate strategic role for\nHR. Whilst these of course have value, this research demonstrates that it is by no means\ncritical, and may at times be counter-productive. In unfavourable political and financial\ncircumstances considerable progress was made through bottom-up informal \u201cpockets of good\npractice\u201d. The three individuals initiated change irrespective of direct senior management\nsupport, and in Felix's case deliberately eschewed that support in order to make progress.\nThey demonstrated varying degrees of organisational irreverence in order to overcome the\nbarriers as they saw them.\nThese tactics are also reflective of a pluralist perspective that acknowledges a diversity of,\nand value in, competing interests. This point of departure from mainstream unitarist HR best\npractice (Caldwell, 2003) may provide HRD professionals struggling to gain recognition of\ntheir value, some glimpses of alternative approaches for making an organisational difference.\nIn demonstrating leadership by linking their activities to key issues, by developing their own\nviews about BLD and by an astute reading and managing of political activity, the three\nindividuals were able to largely overcome the \u201cCatch 22\u201d situations preventing real\norganisational change that are, according to our phase one research, so commonly\nexperienced by individuals in HR\/MD roles. In this sense, the findings here offer a\nrefinement to contemporary blanket best practice leadership development advice and supports\nTruss's (2001) conclusion that the traditional functional approach to HR may be redundant in\nthe face of (political) organisational realities.\nAs these findings are based on only three cases, and our intention to stimulate debate about\nthe role of HRD professionals, care should be exercised in generalising results. However they\ndo suggest several potentially fruitful research directions. For example, In the light of the\nincreasing plurality of organisation forms and interests (Denis et al., 2001), should the HR\nprofession embrace the idea of constructive political values? In order to stimulate innovation,\nshould organisation irreverence become an accepted value in the HR canon? In these cases,\nbottom-up processes of change were effective. Is the tension between managerialist top-down\napproaches and irreverent bottom-up change irreconcilable, or just a passing phase as\norganisations adjust to new models of working that are more appropriate to the new\neconomy? What is an appropriate model for the role and requirements of HR\/MD in the\nconditions of today's turbulent and fragmented business environments? Should they set or\nsimply implement the BLD agenda? Are HR\/MD professionals equipped for taking this\npotentially strategic role?\nWhile such questions will take time to research, our findings also provide immediate points\nof personal reflection for HRD specialists. To this end, following Francis (2002), we hope\nthat they stimulate consideration of competing \u201cworld views\u201d about how and why change is\nimplemented. With this in mind the following questions are designed to compliment the case\nstudies and encourage personal learning and debate about the role and value of HR in the\nenactment of BLD:\n\uf0b7 How well would I rate myself against the leadership capabilities highlighted as being\nimportant in the future?\n\uf0b7 Do I have a clear vision for BLD in my organisation?\n\uf0b7 How well does that fit with the prevailing culture of my organisation?\n\uf0b7 How unfavourable are the circumstances for instituting effective BLD in my\norganisation? What are they?\n\uf0b7 How well am I able to \u201cread\u201d the political landscape?\n\uf0b7 How good are my networking and relationship building skills?\n\uf0b7 How prepared am I to work with others views about what is considered important?\n\uf0b7 How effective am I at creating an organisation mandate for my ideas?\n\uf0b7 To what extent am I prepared to take personal risks to challenge the current situation?\n\uf0b7 To what extent am I prepared to step outside my formal responsibilities to seek\nopportunities to influence?\nIn conclusion, we have sought to explore a key issue critical to understanding the apparent\ndifficulty in applying and benefiting from best practice leadership development advice so as\nto inform innovative future practice \u2013 how leaders in HR\/MD are able to create effective\nBLD and to make a difference personally despite unfavourable circumstances of extreme\nfinancial and political difficulty. These substantial and intractable \u201cCatch 22\u201d problems are\nnot likely to be resolved by simple single solutions or any silver bullets. The issues are bound\nup in the complexity and dynamics of contemporary organisations. However our cases\nsuggest that individual leadership of business leadership development may be one way\nforward in the short-term. We asked whether best practice leadership development advice\nwas fundamentally flawed or simply in need of refinement. To the extent that advice is\npremised on a unitary perspective on organisations and ignores the political capital at stake in\nthe business leadership agenda, then our research of practice would seriously question the\nlikelihood of ever closing the gap through adherence to blanket principles. However,\naccepting a pluralistic standpoint allows practitioners to critically evaluate and selectively\napply these ideas in their specific organisational context. Ultimately, in our view, these cases\nsuggest that in the face of unfavourable organisational circumstances the leadership\ncapabilities (cognitive, relational and political) of development professionals will inevitably\nbe a critical factor in their success.\nReferences\nAmmeter, A., Douglas, C., Gardner, W., Hochwater, W., Ferris, G.
