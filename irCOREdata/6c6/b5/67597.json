The reason why this \ninformation ought to be given is so that patients can make their own autonomous medical decisions. \nTo fail to give such information would constitute a lack of respect for the patient\u2019s autonomy.   \nHowever, as is well known, there is evidence that many patients would be happy to defer decision-\nmaking to clinicians and to adopt a passive\u2014patient\u2014role.\n1\n \n2\n  Schneider goes so far as to refer to \ncurrent informed consent procedures as involving a kind of \u201cmandatory autonomy\u201d\n3\n a phenomenon \ndescribed by Davies and Elwyn as the  \u2018paradox of imposing choice on patients\u2019\n4\n   This evidence has \nimplications for medical ethics: do patients have a right to exempt themselves from medical decision \nmaking that pertains to them?  Matters are made more complex by the fact that there is also \nconsiderable evidence that at many patients who want to defer decision-making to clinicians still \nwant this kind of information.\n5\n \n6\n \n7\n \n8\n \n9\n \n10\n \n11\n  As Czaja, Manfredi and Price put it: \u2018the desire for \ninformation and the desire for involvement in medical care are independent factors\u2019.\n12\n   Auerbach \nconcludes that \u2018whereas most patients say they want detailed information, far fewer say they want \nto participate in decision making\u2019,\n13\n  and that \u2018across a wide variety of medical settings, patients \nreport that they want detailed information about their condition and their treatment whereas stated \ndesire for input into decision making is skewed more in the direction of physician-only or at least \ncollaborative decision-making\u2019.\n14\n  What should the proper response to this be?  Do patients have a \nright to information even though they don\u2019t want to make decisions themselves?   \n This is a complex question and we cannot hope to fully address it here.  In order to even \nbegin to address it certain hurdles have to be overcome.  The first is that the evidence may be \nproblematic for methodological reasons. Different studies use different instruments to evaluate \npatient preferences, with different kinds of question (some specific, some general) and different \nscales.\n15\n   Some ask about what the patient has done, or will intend to do, to get information; others \n1 \n \nsimply ask about \u201chow important\u201d information is to the patient.  Stated information preferences \nmay not translate into action.\n16\n Worse still, one widespread methodology for identifying decision-\nmaking preferences is to use hypothetical scenarios: to test what a patient would do, or prefer, in \ncertain situations.  But, as K\u00fchberger, Schulte-Mecklenbeck and Perner note \u2018there is more to \nmaking decisions than considering hypothetical options\u2019 .\n17\n  Similarly, Verheggen and Van Wijmen, in \ntheir study of research into informed consent to clinical trials, conclude that \u2018there is often a very \nreal and marked difference between the reactions of individuals who actually have been involved in \ntrial research and of those whose responses are based only on conjecture and supposition.\u2019\n18\n  We \nshould thus be cautious as to how much we can infer about patients\u2019 information preferences in \nreal, as opposed to hypothetical, decision-making contexts: especially when emotionally salient, and \npotentially very costly, decisions are to be made.  \n Auerbach concludes that \u2018psychometrically sound instruments\u2019 are needed if a proper \nevaluation of patients\u2019 informational and decisional interests is to be obtained. Auerbach\u2019s \nmethodological critique seems well-founded and the need for methodologically more robust \ninstruments is thus well-supported.    \n The second\u2014related\u2014problem is a lack of clarity as to why patients want information at all. \nThe aim here is to argue that we should not be surprised that patients\u2019 desires for information \nshould be independent of, and often stronger than, their desire to take part in decision making.  Our \ndiscussion\u2014one which uncovers a  variety of reasons people may have for wanting information\u2014\nalso has relevance for how empirical investigators might address some of the methodological \nworries raised by Auerbach and, in the final section some suggestions are made about the kinds of \nquestion that such studies might pose.  This, it is hoped, will help pave the way for clearer discussion \nof the underlying ethical issues. \nOur concern here is with why patients want information. There are two kinds of explanation \nwe might offer.  The first kind of explanation views the acquisition of information as an end in itself.  \n2 \n \nPeople have an intrinsic interest in coming to know things.  We read books, watch documentaries, go \non trips to museums, and the like.  A great deal of our knowledge-seeking may have little to do with \npractical decision making: learning something about rainforest animals may make no difference at all \nto how one behaves.  In general we have a broad desire for knowledge and information that is \nindependent of our desire to take part in decision making: so it is perhaps not surprising that, in \nsome cases, patients want to know about treatments without taking part in decisions about them. \nThis first kind of explanation simply suggests that it is brute fact about human beings that we \nseek information.  There is a second kind of explanation that is more complex, and more interesting.  \nThis kind of explanation views the acquisition of information as a means to achieving or securing \nsome other goal.  Before offering a short list of some of these instrumental reasons, it is important \nto note that the items in our list are not meant to be ranked: the fact that different reasons are \npresented in a particular order is not meant to reflect an assumption that patients will in general \nfind that kind of reason the most important in their deliberation and action.  \n \n(i) Wanting to make decisions\u2014but not about treatment options \n \nInformation is extremely fecund.   Any piece of information can be put to use in indefinitely many \nrational and practical projects.  Information about treatment options may be relevant for making \ndecisions about things other than, say, deciding which option to commit to.  Suppose all treatment \noptions have the consequence that the patient will have to stay in hospital for at least five days.  The \npatient may have to decide who will look after her cat, given the length of the stay, even if she does \nnot want to decide which option is best.  It may be that she cannot defer decision making about the \ncat to another, or, it may be that she does not want to do so.  We cannot directly infer from the fact \nthat a patient does not want to take part in clinical decisions that this reflects a global preference \nagainst being involved in, or making, decisions.  Because information can be used for different \npractical and deliberative concerns, one and the same information may be of relevance to both (a) \n3 \n \nan area or subject matter where the patient does not want to make decisions; (b) an area where she \ndoes.  In general, it seems clear that a methodologically sound study of informational interests ought \nto be sensitive to which projects and decisions the information might be used for.   \n \n(ii) Wanting to be psychologically and emotionally prepared \n \nRelated to (i) is the fact that patients may want information in order to prepare themselves for the \ntreatment, its consequences, or its risks.  Some aspects of preparedness involve making decisions (as \nwith the cat example above).  But there is a broader sense of preparedness that may not: what we \nmight think of as psychological preparedness.  The patient may want to avoid having any nasty \nshocks or surprises.   More generally, she may wish to be emotionally prepared for what might \nhappen.   \n \n(iii) Wanting to know reasons  \n \nGiving information about treatment options and their risks plays the role of putting forward \npotential reasons for different kinds of action.  That is, a specification of the relative risks of different \ncourses of action can be, when coupled with other information and the patient\u2019s own goals and \ninterests, provide reasons for favouring one course of action over another.  But our interest in \nknowing reasons for acting extends beyond our interest in making decisions. For example, human \nbeings have a deep interest in historical explanation: interests in why agents acted as they did even \nthough such reasons are not going to be used in current deliberation.   Such an interest is to do with \nunderstanding other agents and their actions and, although understanding others\u2019 actions may be of \nrelevance to some of our decisions, the key point for our purpose is that we can and do desire to \nknow why someone did some action in the past without having any desire to take part in the \n4 \n \ndecision making that leads to this kind of action (e.g., consider our interest in understanding why a \nserial killer acted as he did).  \nThe giving of reasons is such a familiar part of our everyday communication that we take it \nfor granted.   A failure or unwillingness to give reasons can be distressing, insulting or demeaning.  \nPrimo Levi tells of his experience, having arrived in Auschwitz, starved and thirsty, trying to remove \nan icicle so that he might drink from it.  A guard takes it from him.  Levi asks why.  The guard replies \n\u201cThere is no \u201cwhy?\u201d here\u201d.\n19\n  Levi interprets this as the guard\u2019s claiming that everything is forbidden.  \nBut we can also read it as the guard\u2019s insistence that the normal game of giving reasons will not be \nplayed, so any expectation of an explanation of action will not be met.  The prisoner is so \ncontemptible that no reasons need to be given. \nSuppose a patient wants to completely defer decision making to her clinician.  It does not \nmean that she does not have an interest in learning something about the reasons for acting.  In \nsome cases this may reflect a plain interest in knowing reasons (the kind of interest that could be \nsatisfied by knowing the reasons after the fact).   \n \n(iv) Wanting respect  \n \nHuman beings have a deeply entrenched interest in being respected.  Respect means many different \nthings.  For our purposes the kind of respect that is of concern is \u201crecognition\u201d respect (rather than \nthe \u201cappraisal\u201d or \u201cevaluative\u201d respect that is directed at people in terms of their achievements).  \nRespect for persons is a species of recognition respect: recognising the person as an agent, with her \nown distinct interest and capacities to pursue her life as she sees fit.   \nWe have already seen that a failure to give reasons can be indicative of a lack of respect.  \nBut it would be wrong to infer that it is only when communication involves the giving of reasons that \nrespect can be shown.  Acts of informing\u2014which are our concern here, rather than other speech \nacts like requesting or directing\u2014can readily show respect, or a lack of it.   \n5 \n \nIt should be obvious that the manner of informing can show respect (or contempt).  \nAlthough this is of relevance to a broader discussion of clinical communication, it is not of key \nconcern to us here.  Our concern is with the reasons that patients might have for wanting \ninformation, even though they don\u2019t want to make decisions.  Our puzzling evidence does not \npertain to patients preferences for how they are spoken to, but acts of informing can show respect \nin another way. The fact that a clinician is willing to inform a patient about treatment options may \nbe viewed as indicative of respect (provided it is done so in respectful manner).  The clinician treats \nthe patient as someone who is capable of being informed, and who has an interest in being \ninformed.   A patient can have an interest in being respected without thereby wanting to make \ndecisions herself.   The findings by Joffe et al. support this line of thought.\n20\n   This US study sought to \ndetermine what it is that patients value in hospital care by correlating their evaluation of their care \nacross a number of different variables with their willingness to recommend the hospital to others. \nThe study found that the strongest correlation with a willingness to recommend was being treated \nwith respect and dignity, and having confidence and trust in the clinicians: \u201cThese data suggest that, \namong the experiences measured in this survey, hospitalised patients on average value involvement \nin decision making less than other aspects of treatment\u201d.\n21\n  \n \n(v)  Wanting assurance of trustworthiness \n \nWhen we trust another to do something we rely on them to act in certain (specified) ways that \nrespect our interests.  The fact that the clinician is willing to engage in communication may help to \ninspire confidence in the clinician as a trustworthy agent.    But how can the fact that the clinician is \nwilling to communicate (in certain ways) provide this evidence?  Onora O\u2019Neill notes that \ntrustworthiness with regard to some task X can be achieved by gaining evidence of competence with \nregard to some other task Y (she gives the example of a King sending a suitor Prince on a long quest \nas a test for suitability for marriage to his daughter).\n22\n   The fact that the clinician is willing to talk in \n6 \n \ndetail about the intervention may be taken to be a reasonable, but not infallible, basis for judging \nthat the clinician is honest, open, and has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d and is likely to be trustworthy in other \nrespects.   In contrast, evasive speech, or trying to steer the patient\u2019s questions away from details, \nmay be taken as evidence that the clinician does not give a strong consideration to the patient\u2019s \ninterests.   \n(vi) Wanting assurance of knowledge and competence \n \nOne objection we might have to this line of thought is that trust always rests upon a willingness to \nrefrain from knowing certain things: the parent who trusts the babysitter does not monitor the \nbabysitter via a covert webcam.  So, wouldn\u2019t a desire for information be indicative of a lack of \ntrust? Once again, it is important to bear in mind that placing trust is a complex activity that must \ntake into account at least two elements: a trustee must keep the trusting party\u2019s interests in mind \n(and not be swayed by self-interest when out of view of the trusting party) but she also must be \ncompetent and reliable.  So, those placing trust must be able to assess, and gain assurances, that the \ntrustee will meet both conditions. In giving information, the clinician shows herself to be \nknowledgeable.  \n There is a puzzle here though.  How can a patient, who may lack medical knowledge and \nexpertise, judge that the clinician is competent?  After all, the patient may not understand what the \nclinician says. \n2324\n But the mere fact that the clinician is willing to make these claims allows certain \ninferences to be made.  Communicators know something about the risks that communication puts a \nspeaker under: if the clinicians spouts a load of nonsense, she risks being found out (even if a patient \nis not expert herself, she may, for all the clinician knows, have close friends or family who are, or she \nmay leave the consultation to consult the internet (which does raise its own problems)).  So, the \nthought here is that receiving information from the clinician provides assurance of specific and \nrelevant competence, and part of the rationale for this is that patients know\u2014perhaps tacitly\u2014that \n7 \n \nthe clinician would not risk making explicit incorrect information, in a context where such a \ndisclosure is likely to pose risks to her. \n \n(vii) Wanting assurance of deliberative resources \n \nAs stressed above, these reasons for wanting information are not meant to be taken in isolation.  \nOne reason why this is so is that one and the same act of informing can provide different kinds of \nassurance about the clinician. In addition to competence and trustworthiness, being given \ninformation about treatment options in advance of acting may give an assurance that the clinician \nhas resources for decision making at her disposal, with a tacit implication that she will draw upon \nthose resources in reaching a decision.  That is, prior to acting the patient has assurances that \nwhatever treatment option is decided upon\u2014whether it be by the patient, the clinician, or both \ntogether\u2014it will be based upon a consideration of reasons, alternatives, risks and so on.  Suppose a \npatient\u2014of the kind featured in Schneider\u2019s studies\u2014wants to entirely defer her decision making to \na clinician.  It is not irrational, or irrelevant to seek assurances that the decision will be made in a \nreasonable way, and the disclosure of information can provide this kind of assurance.   That is, a \npatient can want to be assured that a good decision will be made (by someone else) without wanting \nto make that decision herself. \n \n(viii) Wanting opportunities provided by the occasion of informing \n \nOur discussion so far has assumed a largely passive role for the patient: patient as audience.  But \nwhen information is conveyed in a face to face exchange it is standard (though not essential) that \nspeaker and audience can interact with one another.  Of particular importance is the opportunity to \nask questions, to seek clarification, to check claims, and so on.  If the giving of information is bound \nup with an opportunity to ask questions then testing a patient\u2019s interests in gaining information \n8 \n \n(either by asking for her information preferences or by asking her about her practices) may be \ntesting for more than one, independent, element.  That is, the patient may have been primarily \ninterested in the opportunities provided by the occasion of informing, rather than in the content of \ninforming. \n \nConclusion \n \nWhat is striking from our discussion is the variety of reasons that we might have for wanting \ninformation: we might want it because its content is relevant to our decisions (other than medical \nones); or, it may be that that what we want is something that the process of information-delivery \nshows.  In some cases the fact that the information is given may be of relevance to a patient\u2019s \nevaluation of the clinician and the context of clinical care, in other cases the occasion of informing \nmay provide something that is desired, once again, without the patient wanting to use the content \nof what is disclosed in making clinical decisions. \n Our focus has been on the general question of why patients might want information.  Of \ncourse, with regard to any individual patient a different kind of explanatory question can be posed, a \ndemand for an idiographic explanation, one that pertains to the unique individual, in a specific \ncontext.  Though such explanations are not the standard fare of empirical studies there is no reason \nwhy we should exclude such explanations from ethical discussions of patients informational \ninterests.  Indeed, if the discussion here is correct, there will be a complex information-seeking \nnarrative about each individual patient\u2019s informational and decisional interests (this patient may \nwant information to \u201cpsych herself up\u201d, that patient may want information by way of gaining a \ngeneral reassurance of competence and trustworthiness). \n Even without turning to specific idiographic explanations, the discussion here suggests a \nrange of more fine-tuned questions that might be asked by way of finding out about patients \ninformational interests in general.  For example, patients could be asked which of the following they \n9 \n \nwould prefer: meeting clinician to discuss treatment options; receiving the same information by \nemail  (though here it would be important to try to pinpoint why patients have such preferences: for \nexample, it may be that in general we prefer face-to-face communication and, relatedly, older \npatients might also be suspicious or fearful of information communicated via new technologies).   \n For those who express a willingness to defer decision making, questions could be asked of this \ncohort about whether they would prefer (a) no information; (b) information prior to treatment; (c) \ninformation post-treatment.   It would be interesting to find out whether the patients who do not \nwant to make certain kinds of medical decisions, but who do want information, have a stronger, \ngeneral, informational interest than others: this could be tested by asking a range of questions about \nother (nonmedical) intrinsic informational interests  (\u201cDo you read a lot of non-fiction?\u201d \u201cDo you \nwatch news programmes? \u201cDo you watch documentaries?\u201d).  It would be an interesting finding if it \nwere to turn out that patients\u2019 level of informational interest was specifically to do with clinical \nmatters whilst, at the same time, not being linked to making clinical decisions.  At this point this \ncould even prompt further direct self-explanatory questions, as part of a qualitative study, as to why \nsuch information was sought.  Patients\u2019 answers may not be the last word on the matter (unless we \nassume that people automatically know all the reasons that there are for their actions and \nattitudes).   \n These proposed avenues of research still face the kinds of problem noted earlier (e.g., where \nconclusions about patients\u2019 decision-making preferences in real contexts are drawn from finding out \nabout their responses in hypothetical situations.   But, at this stage, these proposals are merely \ntentative suggestions, and it is hoped that the discussion here will be of use to those who seek to \ndevelop sound instruments for gaining information about patient information preferences.  What \nshould be clear from the discussion above, is that given the fecundity of information, and the \ncomplex multi-channelled nature of communication, it is no surprise at all that patients should want \ninformation about treatment options even when they want to defer decision making about such \n10 \n \noptions to others.  Whether patients have a right to such information, in the absence of wanting to \ntake part in clinical decision-making, is a matter for another occasion. \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \n                                                            \n1\n Levinson W, Kao A, Kuby, A, et al.
