But public trust and \nconfidence will remain important to policing policy and practice. Trust and confidence can (a) \nencourage active citizen participation in priority setting and the running of local services, (b) \nmake public bodies more locally accountable and responsive, and (c) secure public \ncooperation with the police and compliance with the law. Analysing survey data from London \nwe find that overall 'public confidence' condenses a range of complex and inter-related \njudgements concerning the trustworthiness of the police. We argue that confidence \nsummarises a motive-based trust that is rooted in a social alignment between the police and \nthe community. This social alignment is founded upon public assessments of the ability of the \npolice to be a 'civic guardian' who secures public respect and embodies community values \n(Loader & Mulcahy, 2003). By demonstrating their trustworthiness to the public, the police \ncan strengthen their social connection with citizens, and thus encourage more active civic \nengagement in domains of security and policing. \n \n \nKey words: Public confidence in policing; PSA23 \n \n \nWord count (total, including footnotes and abstract): 4,038 (3,869 without footnotes) \n \n \n \n \n 3 \nChanges in performance target regimes have raised the profile of public trust and confidence \nin policing in England and Wales to a level not seen since the early 1980s. Until very recently \nthe police worked against the statutory performance indicator derived from the British Crime \nSurvey (BCS) \u2013 \u201cPercentage of people who agree that the police and local councils are \ndealing with the anti-social behaviour and crime issues that matter in their area.\u201d Police \nforces were tasked by the British Government to increase the proportion of local residents \nwho felt confident that their local police (and council) were dealing with the things that matter \nin the local community.  \nThe positioning of public confidence as the paramount performance indicator for \npolice has now been abandoned. At the time of writing the new government\u2019s policies \nregarding police performance \u2013 and how to measure it \u2013 appear to be in a state of flux. But the \nunderlying shift away from micro-managing police and towards placing public opinion \ncentral to policing seems set to continue (Home Office 2008). The Home Secretary may have \nstated that the \u2018fight against crime\u2019 is the only target the police should work to. Yet, there is a \nstrong emphasis within the new government on (a) making public bodies more locally \naccountable and responsive, and (b) encouraging active citizen participation in priority setting \nand indeed the running of local services.  \nWhile the situation remains fluid, one possible outcome might be that more localised \nperformance targets and measures will emerge, perhaps set by local forces or even the \nputative elected police commissioners. Such local targets will attempt to capture what is \nimportant to people living in individual police force areas. But on what bases do the public \njudge the performance of the police? Are aspects of effectiveness (catching criminals, \nresponding in emergencies) paramount, or does the public place greater importance on \nprocedural fairness (treating citizens with fairness and dignity, giving \u2018voice\u2019 and providing \ninformation) or community engagement (understanding and responding to the needs of the \ncommunity)? And on what basis might cooperation and participation be encouraged? \nIn this paper we discuss what confidence in policing means and we assess how it is \nempirically measured. Comparing the PSA23 performance indicator (as the latest example of \na single indicator of confidence) with prior measures of public trust in the police, we argue \nthat such summary questions are useful single measures of overall public confidence in \npolicing. But more nuanced viewpoints are vital if we are to properly understand public \nopinion and work toward greater citizen involvement in the policies and practise of policing. \n\u2018Global\u2019 confidence in policing \u2013 however measured \u2013 is rooted in quite specific public \nassessments of police fairness and shared values\/priorities. To improve global confidence in \nthe police, the police must focus first on how they treat members of the public, and second on \nhow they engage and align themselves with the specific problems that face the community \n(cf. Myhill & Quinton, this volume). \n \nMEASURING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN POLICING \nThe Government\u2019s 2008-2011 Public Service Agreements (PSA) set out the framework in \nwhich the recently scrapped measure of confidence operated. The PSA23 agreement aimed to \n\u2018make communities safer,\u2019 with Priority Activity 3 stipulating to \u2018Tackle the crime, disorder \nand antisocial behaviour issues of greatest importance in each locality, increasing public \nconfidence in the local agencies involved in dealing with these issues.\u2019 PSA23 encouraged \nlocal agencies and partnerships to address the priorities determined by local debate and to \npromote a police force that is sensitive and responsive to a broad range of citizens\u2019 needs. \n Previous performance management regimes included measures of public opinion that \nfocused primarily on the views of users of police services and people from communities with \nproblematic relationships with the police. But the new arrangement heralded a shift to the \ngeneral population. Whatever new regime emerges, it seems probable that forces will \ncontinue be judged against the views of all those they serve, including individuals who have \nlittle experience, knowledge or awareness of actual police activities. Yet, such an emphasis \nmay not be as unreasonable as it first might sound. The police exist to serve all citizens \nequally: one section of the public should not have a higher stake in or claim to judgments \nabout the police. Active citizen participation in the running of a public service as important as \n 4 \nthe police requires, by definition, input from as wide a range of people as possible. Just as \nimportantly, research evidence increasingly finds robust associations between trust and \nconfidence and the readiness of public to involve, cooperate and defer to officers (Tyler & \nFagan 2008; Bradford & Jackson 2010a). Since any individual could find themselves in a \nsituation where they might need or be able to help the police for some reason, the opinions of \nall citizens are relevant. \n Yet, if police performance is to be measured by public opinion surveys, the key \nquestions needs to be \u2018fit for purpose.\u2019 Does, for example, the PSA23 confidence question \nallow survey respondents to accurately summarize their views? Or is it \u2018contaminated\u2019 by \nopinions about the local council? Is the likely complexity of people\u2019s viewpoints straight-\njacketed by single item formats? And are responses to such questions linked to more concrete \nviews about the police, for example ideas about how effective or fair it is? If the answers to \nthese questions are \u2018no\u2019, this would seriously undermine the usefulness \u2013 and indeed fairness \n\u2013 of single confidence measures. Such a finding would have major implications for the new \nsystem which is yet to emerge, and which, it might be hoped, may well rely on research \nfindings to shape policing policy and practice. \n \nPSA23 and single indicators of public confidence in policing \nThe two performance indicators for Priority Activity 3 in PSA23 were measures of public \nperceptions of anti-social behaviour and a single measure of public confidence in \u2018local \nservice providers.\u2019 We address here only the \u2018PSA23 confidence\u2019 measure, which seems to \ninvite respondents to provide some form of \u2018job-rating\u2019 of the police and to some extent the \nlocal council. The full wording is:  \n \n\u2022 It is the responsibility of the police and local council working in partnership to deal \nwith anti-social behaviour and crime in your local area. How much would you agree \nor disagree that the police and local council are dealing with the anti-social \nbehaviour and crimes issue that matter in this area? [Strongly agree, tend to agree, \nneither agree nor disagree, tend to disagree, and strongly disagree] \n \n In order to investigate how people might be answering the question, we draw upon \ndata from the Metropolitan Police Public Attitudes Survey (PAS). The PAS is a large-scale, \nface-to-face, representative sample survey of Londoners (running annually), which asks \nrespondents both the PSA23 and BCS question. Importantly, the survey also probes for public \nviews about how effective they think the police are across a range of activities, as well as \npublic trust in police fairness and community engagement. \n \nTable 1 near here \n \n Table 1 suggests that the PSA23 \u2018global\u2019 confidence measure generates public \nevaluations of the police more than the local council. Shown are the overall frequencies for \n(a) the PSA23 confidence measure, (b) a follow-up question that asks \u2018in terms of dealing \nwith anti-social behaviour and crime issues in this area, how would you rate the performance \nof the police?\u2019, and (c) a second follow-up question that ask \u2018in terms of dealing with anti-\nsocial behaviour and crime issues in this area, how would you rate the performance of the \nlocal council?\u2019. The most important findings are at the top and bottom ends of the scales. \nCombining \u2018strongly agree\u2019 and \u2018tend to agree,\u2019 52 per cent of respondents agreed to some \ndegree that police and local councils were dealing with the issues that mattered, while 51 per \ncent rated the performance of their local police as excellent or good, compared with 37 per \ncent who gave their local council this rating. Similarly, 13 per cent disagreed with the first \nstatement, while 12 per cent gave the police a \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019 rating, compared with 24 \nper cent who did the same for the council.  \n Further light can be shed by comparing the PSA23 question with the standard \u2018local \npolice are doing a good job\u2019 measure. Having greater face validity, this is a \u2018tried and tested\u2019 \nstandard. Inspecting the data, there appears to be a considerable amount of agreement \n 5 \nbetween the old and new measures (see Table 2). Collapsing each item into three levels, \naround two-fifths of the sample believed that both (a) the local police were doing an \nexcellent\/good job and (b) that the police and their partners were dealing with the things that \nmattered in their community. Just under a fifth thought that their local police were doing a fair \njob and \u2018neither agreed nor disagreed\u2019 that the police and their partners were dealing with the \nthings that matter in their community. Points of strong disagreement were rare. Only 1 per \ncent of the sample thought that their local police were doing a poor or very poor job and that \nthe police and their partners were dealing with the things that mattered in their community. \nLess than one in twenty thought that their local police were doing an excellent or good job \nand that the police and their partners were not dealing with the things that mattered in their \ncommunity.1 \n   \nTable 2 near here \n \n This suggests that the PSA23 measure generates public evaluations of the police that \nare similar to those produced by the classic \u2018are the local police doing a good job?\u2019 survey \nquestion. The PSA23 confidence measure and the \u2018good-job\u2019 measure are rather similar, \nalbeit not functionally equivalent. \n \nThe relationship between \u2018confidence in policing\u2019 and \u2018trust in the police\u2019 \n \n\u2018To say we trust you means we believe you have the right intentions toward us and \nthat you are competent to do what we trust you to do.\u2019 (Hardin, 2006: 17). \n \nThus far we have addressed public confidence in policing, as measured using single survey \nquestions. We have referred to this as overall or \u2018global\u2019 confidence. But, we contend, the \npublic engage in quite sophisticated inferences about the trustworthiness of the police. Public \nsensibilities towards the police are fraught with issues of authority, social order and security \n(Loader & Mulcahy, 2003). A trustworthy police force is seen by the public to be effective, to \nbe fair, and to have shared values, interests and a strong commitment to the local community \n(Tyler & Huo, 2002; Sunshine & Tyler, 2003; Jackson & Sunshine, 2007; Jackson & \nBradford, 2009). Trust extends beyond narrow public assessments that police perform their \nduties effectively and efficiently to include: a sense that the police understand the needs of the \ncommunity; that they treat people fairly and with dignity; that they give them information; \nand that they allow members of the community a voice to highlight local problems.  \nSo how exactly does overall confidence \u2013 as measured by the PSA23 confidence \nindicator \u2013 summarise public trust in the police? We analysed the relationship between overall \nconfidence judgments (the PSA23 confidence target as well as the \u2018good-job\u2019 measures) and \nthree dimensions of trust: effectiveness (technical competence, e.g. to tackle drug dealing), \nfairness (procedural fairness, e.g. to treat people with respect) and community engagement \n(shared values, e.g. to listen to the concerns of local people).2 If the summary questions do \nindeed tap into more subtle and precise assessments of the police, then we should find a \nstrong association between overall confidence and some or all of the different dimensions of \ntrust. \n                                                 \n1 Another way to investigate the extent of similarity between the two questions is to compare and \ncontrast their socio-demographic and attitudinal correlates. We found some variation. While some \nsocio-demographic and experiential factors had almost identical associations with the two measures, \nother important characteristics \u2013 such as ethnicity, social class and victim status \u2013 had varying \nrelationships (for more details see Bradford & Jackson, 2010b). However, the substantive differences \nwere rather small.  \n2 We treat these different dimensions of trust as \u2018latent\u2019 variables measured by a set of observed \nindicators \u2013 that is, survey questions. For example, we assess the level of trust that people hold in \npolice effectiveness by using their answers to a series of questions about how effective police are \nacross a number of tasks to \u2018build up\u2019 a picture of their underlying assessment of its efficacy (see \nStanko & Bradford 2009).  \n 6 \nUsing data from the 2008\/2009 PAS we tested a series of statistical models that \nspecified \u2018trust and confidence\u2019 in a number of different ways \u2013 as one \u2018thing\u2019 (spanning \noverall confidence and trust in police effectiveness, fairness and community engagement) and \nas a number of separate \u2018things\u2019 (for example, overall confidence, trust in police \neffectiveness, trust in police fairness and trust in police community engagement). Full details \nof the methodology and results can be found in Bradford & Jackson (2010b) \nThe models that specified trust and confidence as just one \u2018thing\u2019 fitted the data \npoorly. That is to say, public ideas about the police do not constitute one homogenous mass. \nAt the bare minimum, therefore, we need to distinguish between trust in police effectiveness \n(technical competence) on the one hand, and trust in police fairness and engagement on the \nother. However in all the models tested overall confidence and trust in police fairness and \nengagement were highly correlated.3 We can conclude that overall confidence measures are \nvery closely related to active assessments of police behaviour that relates to personal \ntreatment (particularly fairness) and engagement with the community. \nWe can also build up to a more complex model of trust and confidence in the police \n(Figure 1). Tom Tyler\u2019s work on motive-based trust (Lind & Tyler 1988; Tyler 2006; Tyler & \nHuo 2002) suggests that members of the public generate a sense of the character and motives \nof the police which strongly influences their trust judgements. Such motive-based trust turns \non whether the police are seen as having the best interests of the community at heart. It is \npremised on the idea that the parties involved have shared social bonds which make it \npossible for the one to imagine, understand and influence the interests of the other. From this \nperspective, trust in the police becomes a moral connection between citizens and legal \nauthorities: a sense that the police are working on behalf of the community to deliver order, to \ndefend norms and values, and secure a sense of justice which represents the rights and dignity \nof citizens. \n \nFigure 1 near here \n \nWe tested a model in which trust in police effectiveness and fairness each predict \ntrust in police engagement (which we see as a British version of motive-based trust that turns \non whether the police are seen to represent the interests of the community and share their \nvalues, goals and priorities). Then, overall confidence in policing (measured by the PSA23 \nindicator and the local\/London good-job ratings) is predicted by each of the three aspects of \ntrust.  \nThe findings are unequivocal (see Bradford & Jackson, 2010b, for more details): it is \nthe experience and perception of procedural fairness that fosters in people feelings of motive-\nbased trust in \u2013 and shared group membership with \u2013 the authority concerned. Fairness \nencourages the idea that citizens and the police are \u2018on the same side,\u2019 and by treating people \njustly and equitably, police communicate to citizens that they are valued members of the \nsocial group that the police represent (Tyler, 2006; Tyler & Blader, 2000) and that the police \nare active and accessible community authorities (Jackson & Sunshine, 2007). By contrast, \nunfair treatment communicates division, social denigration and exclusion \u2013 thus fostering an \n\u2018us and them\u2019 situation. Finally, overall confidence was predicted most strongly by trust in \npolice engagement and shared values. But given the extremely strong relationship between \nfairness and engagement, we conclude that overall confidence is rooted in perceived fairness \nand that the effect of perceived fairness can work (or might be channelled) through motive-\nbased trust. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nWe have assessed in this paper the survey question (included in both the BCS and PAS) that \nasks its respondents whether they agree or disagree that the \u2018police and local councils are \n                                                 \n3 Although there is evidence that aggregate levels of trust in fairness, community engagement and \noverall confidence may react differently to police communication and other activities (Hohl et al., \n2010). \n 7 \ndealing with the anti-social behaviour and crime issues that matter in their area.\u2019 Answers to \nthe PSA23 measure seem to draw on the same underlying ideas and orientations as do \nanswers to the question which concerns only the police. On the basis of the evidence \npresented here, at least, use of the PSA23 measure did not appear to place the police at any \nmajor disadvantage compared with the older question. The widespread fears that \naccompanied its introduction may well have been mis-founded. \n Naturally, the abandonment of the PSA23 target means that such concerns have in \neffect been answered. But the analysis presented above underlines a more fundamental point. \nSingle item questions such as the PSA23 measure and the old \u2018good-job\u2019 question can act as \nuseful methodological tools that condense a wide range of opinions into an easily digestible \nnugget. If the objective is to know at a high level what public perceptions of the police are in \na particular area (or indeed nationally), then asking people a question similar to those \ndiscussed here is a useful place to start. \n But deeper concerns remain. How can the public be expected to have extensive \nknowledge of the crime problem, the activities of the police, and the impact of police \nactivities on crime and disorder? Can we expect people to judge the performance of the police \nin these terms? Surely public perceptions of the police will be stereotypical and rather one-\ndimensional. \nOn the contrary, people may have rather subtle views that are rooted in complex \nnotions of trust and closely linked to the position of the police in British social, cultural and \npolitical life. Individuals can, and do, make nuanced and considered judgements about the \npolice. Existing work suggests that both the old and new indicators tap most strongly into \ntrust in police fairness and shared values\/interests. The findings presented here are consistent \nnot only with other work based on the PAS (see for example Bradford and Jackson 2010a), \nbut also recent analysis of the BCS (Myhill & Beak 2008) and the US-based work of Tyler \nand colleagues (Tyler 2006; Tyler & Huo 2002). It may be that procedural fairness generates \nmotive-based trust and a sense of shared group membership, encouraging the idea that \ncitizens and the police are \u2018on the same side\u2019 and that the police are \u2018civic guardians\u2019 that \nsecure public respect and embody or protect community values (Loader & Mulcahy, 2003: \n79-89).  \nThe evidence presented here has some important policy implications. Recall that the \nstated aim of PSA23 was to improve public confidence in policing by dealing with the crimes, \ndisorder and ASB issues that were important to local people. It thus appeared to prioritise \neffectiveness over other aspects of police behaviour. This is certainly an emphasis that the \nnew government seems to share. On this account, the demonstration of effectiveness in the \nfight against crime should be sufficient to generate public approval and support for the police. \nYet, it is the procedural fairness of the police and a sense of motive-based trust that are \nconsistently found to be most important to people. This may create a tension between the \nintention of government policy (narrowly interpreted), what forces might think they need to \ndo to in response to policy-setting, and what might be the best ways to actually generate \npublic cooperation and \u2018buy-in\u2019 to the way policing services are provided (and even what \nmight, in the long run, reduce crime). For example, improving the quality of police-public \ninteractions and re-engaging as a visible and accessible presence in the community are, on the \nface of it, some way removed from narrowly instrumental \u2018thief-taking\u2019. \nWe might take heart, however, from some of the stronger claims of Tyler\u2019s \nprocedural justice model. If people perceive the police to be procedurally fair, and if they trust \ntheir motives in behaving the way that they do, all current evidence suggests they are not only \nmore likely to actively cooperate by reporting crime, cooperating in investigations, providing \nwitness evidence, even intervening in situations of low-level deviance and incivility. They are \nalso more likely to defer to officer\u2019s instructions and obey the laws that the police in many \nways still embody. In the long run, the fight against crime might be more efficiently, more \ncost-effectively, and certainly more ethically served by treating the public with fairness, \ndignity and respect than by instigating another \u2018crack-down\u2019 on crime (Hough et al., this \nvolume). \n 8 \nOverall, then, the public seem to see the job of the police as not just dealing with \ncrime, but as rooted also in the defence of civility and community, in treating people fairly \nand with dignity, and in being aligned and responsive to local needs and issues. Properly \nunderstood, the effectiveness of the police \u2013 in the public\u2019s mind at least \u2013 may be revealed \nnot only in the way the police deal with crime, but also by officers being there for victims, \ntreating people fairly, and providing a visible and accessible source of moral authority \n(Jackson & Sunshine, 2007; Myhill & Quinton, this volume). If the police demonstrate to \ncitizens of diverse communities that they are effective, fair and aligned with local interests, \nthen this not only makes the police more directly accountable. It also strengthens the moral \nconnection between people and their police, thus encouraging greater civic participation and \nmore active public engagement in domains of security, policing and the regulation of social \nand community life. \n 9 \nReferences \n \nBradford, B. and Jackson, J.
