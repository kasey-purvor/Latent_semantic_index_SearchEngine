In this period, Mary was finishing \nFrankenstein and Percy wrote, planned and published Laon and Cythna, two texts \nwhich, I will argue, are especially concerned with the meanings of \u201cEurope\u201d and \n\u201cEuropean\u201d.  More specifically, Percy Shelley constructs an idea of \u201cEurope\u201d upon \nhis interests in radical politics and the possibility of utopian and revolutionary social \nprogress.  This construction, however, is not straightforward:  the Shelleys\u2019 reflections \non \u201cEurope\u201d also reveal potential instabilities at the heart of Percy\u2019s radical \n\u201cEuropean\u201d vision, and I focus on how Laon, and to a lesser extent Frankenstein, \nforeground these complexities.  The article begins with the latter text, discussing how \nFrankenstein\u2019s experiment is associated with the particularly \u201cEuropean\u201d problem of \nover-reaching \u2013 a drive for radical success leading to conflict or failure.  I then turn to \nLaon and Cythna, a poem which labels itself as \u201crevolution writing\u201d and contemplates\nhow the French revolution changed \u201cEurope\u201d and what it meant to call oneself \n\u201cEuropean\u201d.  Here Percy Shelley reflects on the possibility of radical reform, but also \nthe disappointments and disruptions within \u201cEuropean\u201d history.  Set in \nConstantinople, a border-zone between Europe and Asia, Laon uses the language of \ncollective identity both to construct \u201cEurope\u201d and to question that same construction.  \nShelley evokes \u201cAmerica\u201d in a similarly double-sided manner:  as a non-European \n\u201cother\u201d and as a more ideal version of \u201cEurope\u201d uncorrupted by post-revolutionary \ndisappointments.  Lastly, based on a remark in a letter to Percy Shelley about \n\u201cEuropean marriage\u201d, I examine the connection between \u201cEuropeanness\u201d and \nparticular sexual mores.  If, for Shelley, debates about \u201cEurope\u201d occur within specific \nparameters relating to revolution and radical change, \u201cEuropean\u201d also has very \ndifferent connotations connected to orthodox moral and sexual conventions.  In this \n2respect therefore, debates about \u201cEurope\u201d in the period encompass wider complexities \nbeyond the immediate political concerns of the Shelley circle.   \nFrankenstein and the \u201cEuropean\u201d Anxiety\n\u201cEuropean\u201d is the first adjective used to describe Frankenstein when he appears in \nMary Shelley\u2019s novel.  Chancing upon Frankenstein and his creation in the Arctic \nwastes, the explorer Walton frames their relationship in terms of a confrontation \nbetween European and non-European:  \u201che was not, as the other traveller [the \nCreature] seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an\nEuropean\u201d (Frankenstein, 13).  Frankenstein himself emphasises this difference \nthroughout the novel, insisting that the Creature \u201cquit Europe forever, and every other \nplace in the neighbourhood of man\u201d (122), as if he has no right to live alongside \nEuropeans.  Frankenstein\u2019s fear of the non-European outsider is all-consuming; he \nworries that if the Creature and his bride \u201cwere to leave Europe, and inhabit the \ndeserts of the new world [\u2026] a race of devils [would] be propagated upon the earth\u201d\n(138).  And yet, as his obsession grows, he becomes an outsider himself, \u201cbanished \nfrom my native country\u201d, \u201ca friendless outcast over the earth\u201d (161).  Walton defines \nhim as a European, but Frankenstein becomes increasingly estranged and isolated, \nwandering in the border regions of \u201cTartary and Russia\u201d, at the very edges of\nEuropean society.  \nBut what is specifically \u201cEuropean\u201d about Frankenstein?  According to his own \ntestimony in chapter one, he hails from a multi-national family, he speaks many \nlanguages and is very well travelled, building precise (and rather exacting) criteria for \nwho a \u201cEuropean\u201d might be.  More importantly, he is associated with radical causes, \nchoosing to conduct his experiment at Ingolstadt university.  Revolution-era works \nlike John Robison\u2019s Proofs of a Conspiracy (1797) and Augustin Barruel\u2019s History of \nJacobinism (1797), traced the founding of the Illuminati order to Ingolstadt, and \npurported to demonstrate how that shadowy society had masterminded the French \nRevolution (St Clair, 437).  Frankenstein\u2019s experimentation is therefore associated \nwith the unorthodoxy and social radicalism of Revolutionary ideas, just as \u201cthe raising \nof ghosts or devils\u201d was thought to be the province of \u201crevolutionary sympathisers\u201d\n(Frankenstein, 254-5n.).  Introduced as a \u201cEuropean\u201d, Frankenstein\u2019s activities are \nideologically connected with radical attempts to re-shape European society, and with \n3the controversial trajectory of recent history.  This has inspired some interesting \nMarxist analyses of the novel\u2019s import.  Frankenstein\u2019s relationship with the Creature, \nsays Franco Moretti, resembles that between the bourgeoisie and \u201cwage-labour\u201d:  the \ncreated subordinate who desires equal participation in society, but who is denied by \nhis self-appointed superiors (Moretti, 84-6).  This argument underestimates, however, \nthe extent to which Frankenstein\u2019s own actions have Revolutionary implications \u2013\nhow his experimentation is connected to the wider upheavals of European society, and \nhow his original and daring triumphs rapidly disintegrate into disappointment and \nself-destructive violence.  To this extent, Frankenstein\u2019s career is an allusion to the \ndegeneration of other radical ideas, similarly identified in the public mind with the \nunorthodox thinkers of Inglostadt university.\nLike Prometheus, Frankenstein is an over-reacher whose glorious successes \nprecipitate disastrous failure.  He becomes aware of the destructive potential in his \nambition early in the novel, observing that \u201cthe pursuit of knowledge\u201d \u201chas a \ntendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste. [\u2026] Study [can be] \nunlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind\u201d (Frankenstein, 37).  However, \nhe concludes, this drive for potentially destructive knowledge has fuelled the course \nof civilisation\u2019s progress as well as its mistakes:\nIf this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to \ninterfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been \nenslaved; Caesar would not have spared his country; America would have \nbeen discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not \nbeen destroyed (37-8)\nIn other words, this notion of \u201cover-reaching\u201d, of the drive for knowledge and power \nleading to conflict or disaster, characterises Europe\u2019s development, and particularly its \nrelations with the non-European world.  \u201cOver-reaching\u201d is thus particularly \nassociated with European history:  through Frankenstein the European, the novel \nexplores radicalism that both redefines \u201cEuropean\u201d progress, and creates a terrifying \nnon-European \u201cother\u201d.  Frankenstein has sustained many fruitful postcolonial \nreadings, which show how the novel is complicit with, but also interrogates, the \nassumptions of imperialist identity politics1.  Yet nobody so far has noted how the text \nconstructs similarly complex ideas of \u201cEurope\u201d \u2013 especially how it associates \n\u201cEuropean\u201d with potentially dangerous radical thought and the concept of \u201cprogress\u201d.  \n4Importantly, however, it also reflects on the problems inherent in those constructions, \nparticularly the fractious interaction of Europeans and non-Europeans, and the \nquestionable directions of \u201cEuropean\u201d social progress theory.  Mary therefore offers \nan uneasy analysis of what defines and shapes \u201cthe European\u201d, and for the rest of this \narticle I wish to show how Percy\u2019s Laon and Cythna explores similar issues and \ndifficulties rather more extensively.  \n\u201cRevolution [\u2026] in an European nation\u201d\nWriting to a potential publisher in 1817, Percy Shelley described Laon and Cythna as:\na tale illustrative of such a Revolution as might be supposed to take place in an \nEuropean nation, acted upon by the opinions of what has been called \n(erroneously as I think) the modern philosophy, & contending with antient \nnotions & the supposed advantages derived from those who support them.  It \nis [\u2026] the beau ideal as it were of the French Revolution (Letters, I, 563-4).  \nShelley thus advertises the work firstly as a kind of historical commentary on \nEuropean history, exploring how writing and debate causes revolution, and secondly\nas an idealised version of those events, a vision of what \u201cEurope\u201d should be like.  \nThe preface to Laon and Cythna continues this double purpose:  the poem \u201cis an \nexperiment on the temper of the public mind, as to how far a thirst for a happier \ncondition of moral and political society survives, among the enlightened and refined, \nthe tempests which have shaken the age in which we live\u201d (Laon, preface, lines 3-6)2.  \nThe poem thus engages with the effects of history, but also attempts to change that \nhistory by \u201ckindling within the bosom of my readers, a virtuous enthusiasm for the \ndoctrines of liberty and justice\u201d (preface, lines 10-13).  In other words, the poem has a \ndetermined project:  it creates a meta-historical European narrative based on the \ninterpretation of the past, and then projects that narrative into an idealised vision of \nEurope\u2019s potential future.  This is not to imply a blinkered optimism:  the preface \nnotes how the historical revolution was not \u201cin every respect prosperous\u201d, since \n\u201csuccessive tyrannies\u201d established themselves afterwards (preface, lines 78-82).  \nInstead, the poem reconfigures recent European history, emphasising both its \nfictionalised \u201cbeau ideal\u201d and its grounding in historical reality.  The first canto, for \nexample, portrays an allegorical conflict between the \u201cgreat Spirit of Good\u201d and its \nManichean opposite, \u201cKing, and Lord and God\u201d, or \u201cFear, Hatred, Faith and \n5Tyranny\u201d (lines 378, 386).  The narrative interprets history in the light of this conflict:  \nin the Revolution \u201cthrones then first shook, \/ And earth\u2019s immense and trampled \nmultitude, \/ In hope on their own powers began to look\u201d (402-4).  Subsequently \nhowever, the \u201coppressors\u201d have struck back by re-establishing convention:  \u201cJustice \nand truth, with custom\u2019s hydra bond, \/ Wage silent war\u201d (419-20).  The plot converts \nrecent historical events into an allegory, relating first the joy of revolutionary success, \nwhen disparate factions are \u201creconciled\u201d by the \u201clove of freedom\u2019s equal law\u201d (1865-\n72), and then the crushing disappointments of the restoration, facilitated by \u201cthe \narmies of the leagu\u00e9d kings\u201d (3825).  In narrating this transition, the poem alludes to \nhow ideas of \u201cEurope\u201d have been in dispute, vacillating between a new vision of \n\u201cnations [\u2026free] of bondage\u201d (2118-20) and a \u201cEurope\u201d defined by \u201cdespots\u201d and \n\u201cbanded slaves\u201d (3824-8).\nThis engagement with the Revolution has two important implications.  Firstly, it \nrevives the political language and concerns of the 1790s:  William St Clair has \nidentified numerous verbal parallels between the preface to Laon and Cythna and the \npreface to the first edition of William Godwin\u2019s Enquiry Concerning Political Justice \n(1793) (St Clair, 431).  Laon and Cythna reinvests late eighteenth-century debates \nabout \u201cmonarchy\u201d, \u201cfreedom\u201d and the state of \u201cEurope\u201d with a new immediacy, \nhoping that poetry can both diagnose oppression and offer hope for \u201cMan\u2019s free-born \nsoul\u201d (3258).  In doing so, Shelley evokes the forthright style of Wollstonecraft\u2019s \nHistory [\u2026] of the French Revolution (1794), which he and Mary Shelley read in \n1814 (M. Shelley, Journals, I, 87).  Here Wollstonecraft identifies historical episodes \nthat definitively reshaped society, from the crusades to the recent Revolution, \nsearching for a means of historical analysis that moves beyond individual states to \ntalk about \u201cEurope\u201d as a totality.  She establishes a progressive history for the sub-\ncontinent, arguing that \u201call Europe\u201d was enslaved by feudalism, but \u201cthe discovery of \nuseful truths\u201d has rapidly spread \u2013 especially from Paris, \u201ca thoroughfare to all the \nkingdoms on the continent\u201d (Wollstonecraft, 220-1, 231, 502).  Speaking of 1789 \nitself, she says \u201crevolution did not interest frenchmen alone, for it\u2019s [sic] influence \nextending throughout the continent, all the passions and prejudices of Europe were \ninstantly set afloat.  That most favoured part of the globe had risen to an astonishing \npre-eminence\u201d (305).  As Shelley does, Wollstonecraft presents this process as \u201cthe \nnatural consequence of intellectual improvement\u201d, foregrounding the influence of \n6writers and thinkers (\u201cthe confederacy of philosophers\u201d) in directly reshaping \n\u201cEurope\u201d (Wollstonecraft, vii and 498). \nHowever, Laon and Cythna was not alone in revitalising this thirty year old debate, \nsince the language of the French Revolution was used to justify contemporary policy \ninitiatives.  According to Leigh Hunt\u2019s Examiner, the British government justified its \nprogramme of repressive legislation in 1817 by comparing the recent stoning of the \nPrince Regent\u2019s coach to the dangers \u201cof 1795, [\u2026] when the pretence was a dread of \nFrance and of Revolution\u201d (Examiner [9 Feb 1817] 81).  Later in the same month, the \nnewspaper couches its own reformist agenda in revolutionary language, titling an anti-\ntaxation article \u201cFriends of Revolution\u201d and complaining about the post-Napoleonic \n\u201cSettlement of Europe\u201d (Examiner [23 Feb 1817] 113).  And in April it mounts an \nextended satirical attack on those who believe that \u201call crimes and sufferings begin \nwith the French Revolution\u201d, offering instead a history of monarchical deviance \n(Examiner [6 Apr 1817] 209).  Like those it criticises, the Examiner uses its own \ninterpretation of revolution to diagnose present political problems, and to project \nhopes for society\u2019s future.\nCentral to all these conjectures is the idea that the Revolution changed \u201cEurope\u201d.  In \nher work France, published in 1817 and read by the Shelleys in the same year, Lady \nMorgan concludes that the Revolution re-defined Europe:  \u201cthe bond of society was \nrent asunder [\u2026] consecrated by the vows of all that was enlightened and liberal in \nEurope\u201d (Morgan, 89; M. Shelley, Journals, I, 100).  Like Shelley and Hunt therefore, \nMorgan bases her understanding of \u201cEurope\u201d on specifically French politics and the \nconsequences of Revolution.  When analysing the \u201cState of Europe\u201d, however, the \nExaminer alternates between emphasising the great changes undergone since 1789, \nand complaining that, after the restoration, the ancien r\u00e9gime remains in place.  An \neditorial entitled \u201cImpossibility of the Continuance of the Present State of Things in \nEurope\u201d, rails against the apparent intractability of \u201cBourbonite\u201d regimes, but \nsimultaneously asserts that Europe has irreversibly altered and \u201cwould not bear any \nsort of dictation\u201d (Examiner [12 Jan 1817] 17).  The paper\u2019s consistent editorial \nposition is that the Allies betrayed a promise to \u201csecure the independence of the State \nof Europe\u201d, replacing Napoleonic rule with monarchical despotism, and refusing to \ncountenance constitutional reform (Examiner [21 Sep and 26 Oct 1817] 611 and 679).  \n7It even uses the word \u201cEurope\u201d to refer specifically to monarchical government:  \n\u201c[Napoleon] pushed Europe to arms in defence of her existence\u201d; \u201cthe Sovereigns of \nEurope hate him\u201d (Examiner, [27 Apr 1817], 275).\nWhat should be clear from this is that discussions about the \u201cState of Europe\u201d and the \nconduct and legacy of the French Revolution, are part of the same debate:  writings \nabout the Revolution, from policy documents to mythologised histories like Laon and \nCythna, are deeply engaged with creating and shaping ideas of \u201cEurope\u201d.  Indeed, \nLaon\u2019s participation in this process is acknowledged by contemporaries.  The Monthly \nReview locates the poem as a Revolutionary document, announcing that \u201cthe wild \nburst of the French Revolution called out ten thousand fancies and furies [\u2026] not only \nwere politics rhapsodised in the cause of that tremendous occurrence, but rhapsodies \nbecame political\u201d (The Monthly Review [Mar 1819] 323-4).  And although John \nGibson Lockhart at first attempts to depoliticise the poem (\u201ca great part of it has no \nnecessary connexion with politics\u201d), he later acknowledges the radical theme, \nmentioning the \u201cRevolutionised city\u201d and the \u201cmen weary of political, and women \nsick of domestic slavery\u201d, mischievously choosing to praise Shelley\u2019s work using \nmonarchical language (\u201cthe noble and majestic footsteps of his genius\u201d) (Blackwood\u2019s\n[Jan 1819] 475-82).  \nBy far the most strident assertion of the poem\u2019s Revolutionary social message occurs \nin Hunt\u2019s Examiner review.  He identifies a utopian purpose to the poem:  \u201cMr. \nShelley is of opinion [\u2026] that the world is a very beautiful one externally, but wants a \ngood deal of mending with respect to it\u2019s [sic] mind and habits\u201d.  Hunt thus turns \nLaon and Cythna into a kind of manifesto and he explains how writing and printing \ncan affect the future of Europe \u2013 \u201cthe Press, which has got hold of Superstition and \ngiven it some irrecoverable wounds already, will, we hope and believe, finally [\u2026] \ncrush it as a steam-engine would a great serpent\u201d (Examiner [22 Feb and 1 Mar 1818]\n121-2, 139-41).  In seeking publicity for Laon, Shelley sought out individuals linked \nto earlier publishing and political controversies, emphasising the close relationship \nbetween radical words and Revolutionary events.  He engaged as co-publishers \nSherwood, Neely and Jones. Sherwood particularly had longstanding connections \nwith the radical publishers of the 1790s, working at one point for H. D. Symonds, \nwho was imprisoned and fined for publishing Paine\u2019s Rights of Man (1791) (Shelley \n8and His Circle, V, 155).  Shelley also sought to create a coterie of people convinced \nof their authority, as poets and writers, to comment on and influence the world of \npolitics.  Reassuring Ollier about the blasphemous and incestuous content of Laon, \nShelley suggested that the Government \u201cwould hesitate before they invaded a member \nof the higher circles of the republic of letters\u201d \u2013 implying that he and other writers \noccupy a political space \u201cbeyond\u201d or outside the proper reach of national governments \n(P. Shelley, Letters, I, 579).  He makes a similar point when anonymously reviewing \nGodwin\u2019s Mandeville (1817) in the Examiner, investing the author (along with \nWollstonecraft) as part of a European community of radicals:  \u201cthe other nations of \nEurope [\u2026] have anticipated the judgement of posterity [\u2026their writings] have been \ntranslated and universally read in France and Germany, long after the bigotry of \nfaction had stifled them in our own country\u201d (Examiner [28 Dec 1817], 827).  In this \nsense, Shelley projects radical writing itself as a revitalisation of \u201cEurope\u201d:   offering \nas the Laon subtitle claims, \u201cA Vision of The Nineteenth Century\u201d.\nThe \u201cBeau Ideal\u201d of Europe\nWhat, however, is the nature of this European \u201cbeau ideal\u201d?  At times, the Examiner\nuses \u201cEurope\u201d to refer to a particular group of states.  A review of James Mill\u2019s The \nHistory of British India (1818), for example, identifies a \u201cEuropean\u201d \u201cnation\u201d; it \nobserves \u201cthe character of the Hindoos\u201d, and makes comparisons with the Europeans, \ncollectivising the members of particular states as sharing certain \u201ccharacteristics\u201d.  \nMill\u2019s work, says the review, \u201caffords much food for national pride\u201d \u2013 but \u201cnational\u201d \ndoes not refer to a specific state like Britain, but rather to collected \u201cEuropean\u201d \nsuccesses, such as victories \u201cagainst large eastern armies\u201d (Examiner [8 Mar 1818]\n157).  A collective idea of \u201cEurope\u201d is constructed through comparison with non-\nEuropean \u201cothers\u201d.  Elsewhere, however, the present condition of \u201cEurope\u201d and \u201cthe \nworld\u201d are collated, as if the \u201cbeau ideal\u201d for that sub-continent were also the ideal \nstate for the whole world.  After Waterloo, Hunt says in an editorial, \u201cthe world would \nnot bear any sort of dictation\u201d, assuming that his understanding of European history is \nuniversally applicable (Examiner [12 Jan 1817] 17).  Later, an article entitled \n\u201cModern Virtue\u201d draws various reformist ideas from the lessons of European history, \nand then universalises them into moral precepts about \u201cfealty to the laws\u201d (not the \nwill of tyrants) and \u201cbenevolence to all mankind\u201d (Examiner [13 Jul 1817], 433).\n9It is precisely this reasoning \u201cfrom a particular to a universal\u201d that J. T. Coleridge \nobjects to in his review of Laon and Cythna:  for him Shelley had formulated \nerroneous universal laws from irrelevant observations about oriental tyranny \n(Quarterly Review [April 1819] 460-71).  Certainly, in his letters about the poem, \nShelley details its universal relevance:  \u201cI have attempted [\u2026] to speak to the \ncommon & elementary emotions of the human heart\u201d (Letters, I, 563).  Comments \nlike this lead Nigel Leask to suggest that Shelley creates \u201ca fantasy of the \nuniversalism of revolutionary reason\u201d, desiring \u201ca state of universal Sameness\u201d in \nwhich other cultures can be \u201calchemized\u201d into resembling the European revolutionary \nideal (Leask, 128 and 89)3.  However, as we have seen, Shelley also evokes \nmembership of a smaller, more exclusive coterie (the \u201chigher circle of the republic of \nletters\u201d [Letters, I, 579]), as well as an international \u201ccommunity of feeling\u201d, where \npeople \u201cmaintain that connexion between one man and another\u201d by mourning \u201cany \npublic calamity which has befallen their country or the world\u201d (P. Shelley, Prose \nWorks, 232)4.  \nThis same problem recurs throughout Laon and Cythna when Shelley relates the \ndisappointments of European history and his hopes for reconciliation.  In canto V the \nnarrator mentions how, in the course of revolution, disparate \u201cpatriots\u201d, defined by \ntheir enthusiasm for parochial identity, gradually form a wider community:  \u201cthey, \nand all, in one loud symphony \/ My [Laon\u2019s] name with Liberty commingling\u201d (lines \n1873-4).  In terms of Shelley\u2019s European myth-history, he here imagines the \nreconciliation of post-revolutionary \u201cEurope\u201d, when different states had the chance to \nrally around one governmental ideal and the concept of \u201cLiberty\u201d.  The delineation of \nvarious groups or collective identities thus articulates the competing visions of \n\u201cEurope\u201d presented in the poem.  Canto V imagines a \u201cEurope\u201d riven by tribal \nconflict:  \u201cour tribes were gathered far\u201d, in the \u201cpatriot hosts\u201d \u201cmurderers fled \/ like \ninsect tribes\u201d (1770-84), before eventually allying as a \u201cmighty brotherhood \/ Linked \nby a jealous interchange of good\u201d (1839-41).  Elsewhere, however, the poem evokes \nuniversal ideas of Liberty and Equality, imagining \u201cEurope\u201d as a unified assembly of \n\u201cfree spirits\u201d rather than competing rivals.  Laone\u2019s ode celebrates this commonality:  \n\u201ca hundred nations swear that there shall be \/ Pity and Peace and Love, among the \ngood and free\u201d (2210-1).  This introduces an important uncertainty.  Is the revolution \nof the Golden City a nationalist uprising of \u201cpatriots\u201d struggling for independence \n10\nagainst a ruler which has \u201cdispossessed \/ All native power\u201d (977-8)?  Or is it the \nunification of many peoples in a common cause?  Is it a particularist rebellion for the \nreclamation of \u201cnative power\u201d, or a universal act, whereby disparate factions act as \none?  This uncertainty is visible from the poem\u2019s preface, when Shelley explains how \nhe intends to inspire \u201ca virtuous enthusiasm for those doctrines of liberty and justice, \nthat faith and hope in something good, which neither violence, nor misrepresentation, \nnor prejudice, can ever totally extinguish among mankind\u201d (preface, 10-13).  But \nwhat kind of project is this?  Does Shelley present the \u201cbeau ideal\u201d of a rebellious \nindividual nation, of an international community, or a universal vision for the world?  \nAnd the question matters because it resembles precisely the challenge of \nunderstanding \u201cEurope\u201d as a space for competing nationalisms, as a transnational \ncollective, or as a universal ideal (in that \u201cEurope\u201d represents the premier social state \nfor all humanity).  \nThis interest in the potential universality of European society is, of course, hardly \nunique to Shelley.  Volney also suggested that \u201cthe communication of knowledge will \nextend from society to society till it comprehends the whole earth.  By the law of \nimitation the example of one people will be followed by others, who will adopt its \nspirit and its laws [\u2026Despots will relent] and civilisation will be universal\u201d (Volney, \n115-6).  But Shelley is not quite this explicit:  by investigating various notions of \ngroup identity, and by doubting the extent to which \u201cEuropean\u201d government or ideas \nmight have universal or particular applicability, Laon and Cythna questions what \n\u201cEuropean\u201d might mean, or to whom it might apply.  Unfortunately, Shelley does not \noffer a solution to these complexities.  By contrast, Hazlitt\u2019s fragmentary \u201cOn \nPatriotism\u201d (published in the same year as Laon) understands universal collectivity\nthrough patriotism.  Love of country, he says, \u201cis little more than another name for the \nlove of liberty, of independence, of peace, and social happiness\u201d (Hazlitt, I, 238)5.  In \nother words, patriotism inspires not merely a devotion to the particular, but also a \nuniversalist social vision, an ideal for all societies.  Hazlitt insists that patriotism is \n\u201cnot a natural but an artificial idea\u201d; despite its apparent parochialism, it has much \nwider application beyond the \u201clocal\u201d.\nConstantinople\n11\nThe setting of Laon and Cythna provides an important context for understanding the \n\u201cEuropean\u201d.  The action is \u201csupposed to be laid in Constantinople and modern \nGreece, but without much attempt at minute delineation of Mahometan manners\u201d (P. \nShelley, Letters, I, 563).  Although the poem deals with events \u201cas might be supposed \nto take place in an European nation\u201d, it is thus set at the very edges of \u201cEurope\u201d.  \nThroughout 1817 and early 1818, the Shelleys read Edward Daniel Clarke\u2019s massive \nTravels in Various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa (1810-23) (M. Shelley, \nJournals, II, 642), which talks of Constantinople as the location where Asia and \nEurope meet, both a dividing border and a fusion of different cultures and historical \nperiods:  harems co-exist with Greek language booksellers, and the city\u2019s inhabitants \nare \u201cages behind the rest of the world\u201d.  In this way, Constantinople reveals the \n\u201cotherness\u201d of the non-European, but also represents the historical origins of Europe \nsince \u201cAthens itself was not very unlike Constantinople in its present state\u201d.  It is both \nan \u201cother\u201d and an exemplar of Europe (Clarke, I, 669; II, 4-8, 20-1, 49).  For some \ncontemporary reviews, this setting renders Laon\u2019s politics inadmissible.  John Taylor \nColeridge complains that \u201cthe laws and government on which Mr Shelley\u2019s reasoning \nproceeds, are the Turkish, administered by a lawless despot[\u2026] We are Englishmen, \nChristians, free and independent; we ask Mr Shelley how his case applies to us?\u201d.  \nColeridge suggests that the poem is irrelevant to the concerns of a European audience, \nexcept that Greece, \u201cthe land full beyond all others of recollections of former glory \nand independence [is] now covered with shame and sunk in slavery\u201d (Quarterly \nReview [Apr 1819], 466).  Responding to this accusation, Hunt upholds Shelley as an \nexemplary \u201ccitizen of the world\u201d whose words break down borders and have universal \nrelevance (Examiner [10 Oct 1819] 653).  William St Clair argues that Shelley might \nhave used imagery of \u201cthe East\u201d to disguise the European pretensions of his politics:  \nphilosophical writers \u201cwrote Constantinople when they meant London and \nMahometanism when they meant Christianity\u201d to avoid censorship laws \u2013 \u201cas Godwin \nhad been taught in theology class, a war to drive the Turks out of Europe was a \nuniversally accepted paradigm of a just revolution\u201d (St Clair, 234, 432).  By setting \nLaon and Cythna in Constantinople, and eventually re- titling the poem The Revolt of \nIslam, Shelley could attack organised religion and tyrannous government, and \nadvocate revolution more easily.  Montesquieu had used a similar tactic in the Persian \nLetters (1721), ensuring greater freedom to critique French society by employing \nPersian narrators who he ironically denounces as \u201cfull of ignorance and prejudice\u201d \n12\n(Montesquieu, 284).  In the 1790s this strategy gains a new immediacy.  Volney, for \nexample, connects Turkey and Revolutionary France through the language of liberty:  \n\u201ca great nation [\u2026] contracted a fondness for a nation the enemy of liberty [\u2026] The \nFrench were smitten with a passion for the Turks:  they were delirious of engaging in \na war for them, and that at a time when a revolution in their own country was just at \nits commencement\u201d (Volney, 103).  This kind of association makes it ideologically \npossible to allude to European revolution whilst overtly discussing Turkey or \u201cthe \nEast\u201d.  \nAt some points in Laon, however, this duel interest in \u201cEurope\u201d and the \u201cEast\u201d \nmanifests itself as an apparent hostility between the two.  In the preface, Shelley \nblames the Roman Empire\u2019s fall on the infiltration of \u201cEastern\u201d attitudes and \npractices:  \u201ccontempt for virtue [\u2026] arising from the enslaved communities of the \nEast, then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream\u201d (lines 226-9).  \nAnd the poem itself hints obliquely at threats from the east:  in canto I an easterly mist \nshrouds the \u201corient sun in shadow\u201d and in canto III, the \u201cazure East darkness again \nwas piled\u201d (1404).  Later, the Tyrant himself is presented as an oriental despot:  \nCythna is captured by his Tartar troops (2558) and held captive by an \u201cEthiop\u201d at \n\u201cOman\u2019s Sea\u201d (the Persian Gulf).  In canto IX his followers are explicitly described as \nMuslims (3532-4).  Nigel Leask glosses the ambiguous second title of the poem as \nmeaning \u201crevolt against Islam\u201d; that is, the poem presents revolution by civilised \nprogressives against Islamic despotism and oppression.  This, says Leask, involves the \nimposition of Eurocentric ideas of \u201cuniversal\u201d liberty:  \u201cfor Shelley, [the East] \nbeckoned as an uncluttered site for the fulfilment of frustrated dreams of liberty, but \nin practice revealed itself to be treacherous and obstacle-ridden, the nemesis of \nrevolutionary narcissism\u201d (Leask, 73 and 10).  \nHowever, Shelley\u2019s presentation of Constantinople is more complex than this might \nsuggest:  the Golden City is neither simply a disguised European city in the throes of \nrevolution, nor an example of authoritarian Oriental rule; rather, it is a combination of \nboth.  In her work on the interaction of cultures, Mary Louise Pratt speaks of \u201ccontact \nzones\u201d, or \u201csocial spaces where disparate cultures meet and clash\u201d, places where \npeoples encounter and represent \u201cothers\u201d, and then reconfigure themselves in terms of\nthat encounter (Pratt, 4).  Shelley, I think, presents Constantinople \/ the Golden City \n13\nas such a contact zone \u2013 a space where different ideas of \u201cthe European\u201d and the \n\u201cnon-European\u201d co-exist simultaneously.  The city is on the borders of \u201cEurope\u201d, \nacting both as an exemplar of European history (presenting an ideal of past, and the \npossibility of future, revolutions) and as a non-European \u201cother\u201d \u2013 an unenlightened \noppressive state, opposed to liberty and revolution.  Put briefly, the Golden City \nsimultaneously represents \u201cEurope\u201d and its \u201cother\u201d \u2013 Shelley\u2019s ideal of revolution and \nits reactionary opposite.  \nShelley is not alone in this complex use of Constantinople as a literal and ideological \nborder between \u201cEurope\u201d and \u201cnon-Europe\u201d.  The broad idea of seeing the East (and \nespecially Constantinople) as a battleground between European freedom and Islamic \ntyranny seems to have been popular in the period.  In Lalla Rookh Thomas Moore \nsays that \u201cliberty\u201d cannot exist in an Islamic government (Moore, 378-9) and the \nExaminer worries that the oppressive governance of the East could spread to Europe:  \n\u201csuch is the state of the Eastern world, where [\u2026] the tendency [\u2026] to tyrannise and \nto be tyrannised over, has had full time to develop itself. [\u2026] Our turn seems next\u201d \n(Examiner [12 Jan 1817] 26).  In Thomas Jefferson Hogg\u2019s fictional Memoirs of \nPrince Alexey (1813), the title character visits the city and observes the \u201ctyranny of \nthe Turks\u201d as well as cultivating an \u201cexcessive love of perfect liberty\u201d.  \nConstantinople is a scene of strange and backward otherness, a place to think radical \nthoughts about the future \u2013 especially regarding rebellion in Greece (Hogg, Alexey,\n75-6).  Henry Weber\u2019s Tales of the East (1812), read by the Shelleys in 1815 (M. \nShelley, Journals I, 92), praises the city for offering a romantic escape into the \nfictions of the \u201cArabian Nights\u2019 Entertainments\u201d, and a true insight into \u201cauthentic \nportraits of oriental manners\u201d (Weber, I, iii)6.  But Weber\u2019s image of east-west \nrelations is different from Shelley\u2019s, for Laon uses the same image to construct an \nidea of \u201cEurope\u201d and its other \u2013 a scene of European revolution and an oriental \ndespotism.  In formulating what \u201cEurope\u201d should be like, the City is both an exemplar \nand a warning.\n\u201cAmerica\u201d: The New \u201cEurope\u201d?\nIn contrast to such complex understandings of \u201cEurope\u201d, the Shelley circle presents \nAmerica as a living paradise.  The conclusion of Laon and Cythna eulogises America\nas:  \u201cA land beyond the Oceans of the West \/ Where [\u2026] Freedom and Truth \/ Are \n14\nworshipped\u201d (lines 4415-7).  England, the former inheritor of Athenian democracy, \nhas become oppressed \u201cby inbred monsters\u201d, and now \u201cher chainless child\u201d America\nembodies the Greek legacy (4420-1).  In preserving this tradition, the United States \nprovides \u201can epitaph of glory for the tombs \/ Of murdered Europe\u201d (4427-8) \u2013 it has \ntaken up the mantle of European history and now defines what it means to be \n\u201cEuropean\u201d more fully than post-restoration \u201cEurope\u201d itself.  This is a complex \nassertion, for it identifies a \u201cEuropean\u201d tradition (extending from Greece to Britain), \nbut then strips that tradition of its specific \u201cEuropeanness\u201d by suggesting that America\nexemplifies its characteristics.  Put differently, the idea of \u201cEurope\u201d becomes the idea \nof \u201cAmerica\u201d.  Thirty years earlier, Richard Price had proclaimed America the heir of \na \u201cglorious\u201d liberal-revolutionary tradition initiated in Britain (Price, 49-50).  By \n1817, however, the Examiner sees America as the vanguard of progress, and Europe \nthe slothful follower.  In an article praising Congress\u2019s decision to commission \nhistorical paintings of Independence, the writer says \u201cAmerica, with a foresight and \nenergy worthy of Greece, has set them [the British government] an example it should \nhave been their glory to set her\u201d (Examiner [13 Apr 1817] 230).  The Examiner pays \nparticularly close attention to South American revolutions too, claiming that \u201cthe \nactual work of freedom\u201d is going on there despite the recent failures in Europe.  The \nrevolution in Brazil, the paper claims, is \u201cconnected with the subject of reform all \nover the world\u201d, since it attacks \u201cthe incorrigible pretensions of \u2018Legitimacy\u2019\u201d by \nengaging in a \u201cstruggle for independence\u201d.  It draws an explicit comparison with \n\u201cEurope\u201d under the Allies, noting their hypocritical warnings to Portugal to refrain \nfrom \u201cacting in the New World to the provinces of Spain as they have done in the old \nto Norway, Saxony and Italy\u201d (Examiner [12 Jan and 1 Jun 1817] 18, 337-8).  \nAmerica has become the new bastion of Reform:  in the Examiner, as in Laon, the \n\u201cbeau ideal\u201d for \u201cEurope\u201d has been magnified into a universal (applicable to all\ncountries everywhere), and displaced into the precise locales of north and south \nAmerica.  \nThis adulation of American revolutionary potential once again demonstrates the 1817 \nShelley circle\u2019s deep engagement with the political work of the 1790s.  \nWollstonecraft, for example, describes the American Revolution as \u201can experiment in \npolitical science\u201d \u2013 an opportunity to lay the \u201cfirst stones\u201d of government without \nrepeating the mistakes of absolute monarchy.  \u201cAnglo-americans\u201d, she says, \n15\n\u201cappeared to be another race of beings, men framed to enjoy the advantages of \nsociety, and not merely to benefit those who governed\u201d (Wollstonecraft, 13-14).  The \nuse of \u201crace\u201d highlights the \u201cotherness\u201d of American society when compared to \nEuropean practices, but also implies that Americans are \u201cnaturally\u201d or intrinsically \nmore advanced, as well as the products of a superior culture.  In The Ruins, Volney \ntraces the universal development of human society, looking forward to the time when \ndisconnected states will band together, ending the \u201cperiod of faction\u201d.  America, he \nproclaims, will help institute this transnational idyll by instigating \u201ca new age\u201d \u201cof \nsurprise and dread to tyrants, of emancipation to a great people, and of hope to the \nwhole world\u201d (Volney, 117-8).  Volney and Wollstonecraft see the New World as a \nmore perfect version of their hopes for \u201cEurope\u201d and the Shelley circle replicated \ntheir views twenty years later, the disappointments surrounding European revolution\nonly amplifying their expectations.\nOf Shelley\u2019s Marlow circle in 1817-18 only Hogg expresses reservations about \nAmerica.  \u201cIn heart I am more a Grecian than ever\u201d, he writes to Peacock.  \u201cThe \nvulgarity of America as depicted in Ashe\u2019s Travels & shewn by all other \ncommunications from that country, &, which in a great measure arises from ignorance \nof Classical Literature, is so disgusting, that we shrink from it in horror & take refuge \nin the ruins of antient taste & elegance\u201d (Hogg, Athenians, 38).  Unlike Shelley and \nHunt, who identify the most recent incarnations of ancient Greek culture in \ncontemporary states, Hogg, and to a lesser extent Peacock, assert the complete \nseparateness of the modern world and its Grecian past.  Peacock\u2019s Rhododaphne\n(1818) invokes Greece as a means of withdrawing from the world through study:  \n\u201cAmong those gifted bards and sages old \/ Shunning the living world, I dwell and \nhear\u201d (Rhododaphne, 3). Whereas for Shelley Greece is a living concept visible in the \nworld, for Hogg and Peacock it is a vanished ideal, and modern pretenders are poor \nimitators of its splendour.  As Hogg admits, his comments on America\u2019s neglect of \nclassical tradition derive from Thomas Ashe\u2019s Travels in America (1808).  This work \nrevels in a scathing critique of the United States, attacking \u201csordid speculators\u201d, \n\u201cshameful degeneracy\u201d and the \u201cbigotry, pride and malignant hatred\u201d which infects \nthe country.  Significantly though, like admirers of America, Ashe associates the \ncountry with support for the French Revolution, including a bogus account of a \nSussex farmer who, infused with enthusiasm for revolution, \u201cfixed on America as his \n16\ndestination\u201d as it seemed to realise his dreams of reform (Ashe, I, 2-4 and 56-66).  \nAshe uses this thinly disguised fiction to assail both the U.S. and the concept of \nrevolution, but, like Shelley, he assumes that America embodies a reformed \u201cEurope\u201d.  \nFor detractors and supporters alike, America is understood in terms of ideas about \n\u201cEurope\u201d \u2013 according to their conceptions of what \u201cEurope\u201d should be like, and \nwhether the United States has emulated or destroyed that ideal.\n\u201cEurope\u201d and Sexual Morality\nThus far, I have written about \u201cEurope\u201d as a historical or political concept.  But what \ndid it mean to the Shelley circle to be \u201cEuropeans\u201d?  How should a \u201cEuropean\u201d\nbehave?  In this section, I explore how being \u201cEuropean\u201d meant adhering to certain \ncodes of sexual morality.  Shelley and his friends were often accused of disrespecting \nmarriage, of conducting unorthodox (i.e. extra-marital) sexual relations, and therefore \nof not being \u201cEuropean\u201d.  This shows the term \u201cEurope\u201d being used in a very \ndifferent way:  to bolster conventional forms of social behaviour, rather than to \nexplore the complexities of radical politics.  \nIn December 1817, William Baxter, a member of Godwin\u2019s circle and father of \nMary\u2019s childhood friend Isabel, wrote to Shelley, defending his decision to break \ncontact between their families:\nThe station your rank and fortune gives you in society, the sphere which it \nentitles you to move in are such as I cannot in good conscience introduce my \nfamily into [\u2026].  This independence of fortune, too, has given you a freedom \nof thought and action entirely inconsistent with the customs, manners and \nprejudices of European society with which I have been at pains to imbue their \nminds, and which I wish not to see eradicated. (P. Shelley, Letters, I, 586)\nWhat did Baxter mean by defining Shelley\u2019s conduct as \u201cuneuropean\u201d?  As the \neditors of Shelley and His Circle suggest, Baxter\u2019s letter was probably written at the \ninstigation of his son-in-law (and Isabel\u2019s husband) David Booth, who explained his \nreservations about the Shelleys in a letter to his wife early in 1818: Percy Shelley is \n\u201ccertainly insane\u201d, partly because he associates with the scandalous Byron, but mainly \nbecause, according to Booth, he lives alternately with Mary and Claire Clairmont.  As \na result, he \u201ctramples on the morality of his country\u201d, excluding himself from British \nand European society (Shelley and His Circle, V, 391-2).  Shelley\u2019s perceived lack of \n17\n\u201cEuropeanness\u201d therefore derives from his alleged sexual immorality:  Booth and \nBaxter imply that \u201cEurope\u201d is defined by particular social codes, notably marriage.\nShelley himself, of course, was much exercised by marital problems in this period, \nand he would often discuss these matters using the language of Revolution, \ncomplaining of his \u201cpersecution\u201d by those who disrespect his radical opinions.  And \nyet he constitutes those principles as important aspects of future reform, for by\nholding to them he provides \u201cimportant benefit to mankind\u201d.  Writing to Byron about \nthe custody battle for Charles and Ianthe, Shelley interprets the debate about his \nunorthodox ideals and (sexual) behaviour as an epic conflict between Reform and \nReaction:  his enemies intend to \u201cexpose me in the pillory, on the ground of my being \na REVOLUTIONIST and an Atheist\u201d (Letters, I, 557 and 530).  In this sense, like his \n\u201cenemies\u201d, Shelley connects his personal conduct and his political ideals:  his notions \nabout marriage are an expression of the perfect, reformed \u201cEuropean\u201d society.  \nShelley explores this connection further in his draft declaration to the Chancery court \nregarding the custody case:  \u201cthe allegations from which this unfitness [for paternal \ncustody] is said to proceed, are reduced to a simple statement of my holding doctrines \ninimical to the institution of marriage as established in this country\u201d.  \u201cMarriage\u201d, he \ncontinues, \u201cas it exists precisely in the laws and opinions of this country, [is] a \nmischievous and tyrannical institution\u201d, adding that he has dared to imagine an \nalternative \u201csystem of social life\u201d and that \u201call ages and countries have admitted in \nvarious degrees the principle of divorce\u201d (Prose Works, 168-9).  For him, the primary \nissue is one of social organisation, and he allies himself with a cosmopolitan \nflexibility regarding marriage and divorce, and against parochial British law.  This is \nnot specifically an idea of \u201cEurope\u201d, since Shelley invokes a universal ideal (\u201call ages \nand countries\u201d).  But nevertheless, he builds upon an important tradition which \ndefines \u201cEuropeanness\u201d by reference to marriage.  Writing in 1797, probably with \nWollstonecraft in mind, Godwin remarks \u201cI find the prejudice of the world in arms \nagainst the woman who practically opposed herself to the European institution of \nmarriage\u201d (St Clair, 173).  To Godwin\u2019s dismay, being properly \u201cEuropean\u201d depends \nupon adhering to a particular sexual code \u2013 and the concepts are so closely aligned \nthat marriage itself is a \u201cEuropean institution\u201d.  By questioning marital laws in his \n18\nChancery papers, Shelley is thus postulating an alternative vision of \u201cEuropean\u201d\nsocial relations \u2013 one not so wedded to stringent marital codes.\nMarriage is a defining feature of European society in Hunt\u2019s Examiner:  \u201cthe \ndegeneracy of some nations of the East, the Egyptians and Chaldeans for instance, has \nbeen traced to the marriages that were in use between brothers and sisters\u201d.  By \ncontrast, \u201cEurope\u201d has excelled through its practice of international marriage:  the \nGoths and the Romans together produced \u201cthe early modern Italians, who led all the \ngenius of modern Europe\u201d, and the French have recently become pre-eminent \u201cpartly \ndue to the great mixture of breed that has resulted from their free intercourse with all \nthe other nations of the Continent\u201d.  The most \u201cfeeble houses\u201d are consequently Spain \nand Portugal \u2013 the least internationalist and the most inbred states (Examiner [26 Oct \n1817] 731).  According to this thesis, international marriage is what defines \u201cEurope\u201d, \nboth in terms of common adherence to the custom, and also because it facilitates \ninter-state communication and the sharing of ideas.  \nHunt\u2019s interest in marriage contributes to what Jeffrey Cox calls his \u201csexualised \nimagination\u201d, epitomised in the erotic imagery of Foliage (1818), and The Story of \nRimini (1816), which, like Laon and Cythna, deals with incestuous behaviour (Cox, \n71). Reviewing these works, Hunt\u2019s opponents also make the connection between \n\u201cEuropeanness\u201d and sexual morality.  Lockhart\u2019s assessment of Rimini assaults \nHunt\u2019s style:  \u201chis poetry resembles that of a man who has kept company with kept-\nmistresses\u201d \u2013 in other words, it indicates his sexual deviancy.  And this criticism is \nintimately connected to Hunt\u2019s faulty understanding of international relations and \nEuropean culture.  On the one hand, Lockhart attacks Hunt\u2019s lack of languages, \nsuggesting that he has not received a proper European and classical education.  But on \nthe other hand, Hunt\u2019s views are a \u201cdilution of the blasphemies of the Encyclop\u00e9die \u2013\nhis patriotism a crude, vague, ineffectual, and sour Jacobinism\u201d (Blackwood\u2019s [Oct \n1817] 38-41).  Lockhart thus criticises from two distinct directions, arguing firstly that \nHunt is ignorant and not an internationally minded gentleman; but also that he is \nexcessively international \u2013 copying the radical extremism of the philosophes and thus \nnot correctly patriotic.  This widely disseminated review therefore links dubious \nsexual morality with \u201cdefective\u201d political views \u2013 just as Wollstonecraft\u2019s political \nradicalism and alleged sexual licentiousness had been connected in the 1790s7.  \n19\nJ. T. Coleridge\u2019s review of Laon and Cythna objects using very similar terminology.  \n\u201cMr. Shelley is his own Laon\u201d, Coleridge says, as if Laon\u2019s behaviour accurately \nmirrors Shelley\u2019s.  Alluding to the controversial incest theme Coleridge writes:  \n\u201c\u2018Love,\u2019 [Shelley] says, \u2018is to be but the sole law which shall govern the moral world\u2019\n[\u2026] We are loath to understand it in its lowest sense, though we believe that as to this \nissue this would be the correctest mode of interpreting it\u201d (Quarterly Review [April \n1819] 467-8).  For this reason \u2013 because Shelley writes about sexual taboos \u2013 his \nideas about the reformation of \u201cEurope\u201d are inadmissible:  he wishes \u201cto abolish all \nsocial strictures\u201d by questioning both the ideal political state of \u201cEurope\u201d, and its \naccepted sexual customs.  In defending Shelley from this onslaught, Hunt reassures \nhis readers of Shelley\u2019s conventional lifestyle, while simultaneously supporting his \nright to propound new theories and potentially \u201calter the condition of sexual \nintercourse\u201d.  Significantly, however, he also declares that Shelley is a proper \nEuropean \u2013 engaged with the international problems of \u201cEurope\u201d despite the original \npoem\u2019s apparent questioning of sexual orthodoxy.  He quotes Bacon in reference to \nShelley:  \u201c\u2018If a man be generous towards strangers, it shews he is a citizen of the \nworld, and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that \njoins to them\u2019\u201d (Examiner [10 Oct 1819] 653).  The imagery here of a parochial island \ndisconnected from the European mainland is powerful:  Shelley is a world-citizen, \nand not a narrow-minded islander like his opponents, who attempt to exclude him \nfrom \u201cEuropean\u201d society.\nThis debate, then, is partly about the conventions of \u201cEuropean\u201d behaviour, and partly \nabout the idea of \u201cEurope\u201d itself \u2013 what kind of common characteristics or customs \n\u201cEuropean\u201d societies should possess.  Ronald Paulson notes how Revolutionary \ndebate in the 1790s was filtered through the language of sexuality:  Burke emphasised \nthe dangers of insurrection by narrating the storming of the French palace as a sexual \nassault on Marie Antoinette, forced to \u201cfly almost naked\u201d from revolutionary \ndeviants. \u201cThe act of love\u201d, Paulson says, \u201cwas an act of rebellion, or at least a \nscandalous act, in the context of a society of arranged marriages and closed families\u201d\n(Paulson, 65 and 268).  By this logic, people with unorthodox sexual lives challenged \nthe very basis of society.  In Peacock\u2019s satirical novel Melincourt (1817), the \nreactionary Mr. Vamp exclaims that \u201cevery man who talks of moral philosophy [i.e. \n20\nradical ideas] will never make any scruple of seducing his neighbour\u2019s wife\u201d, as if \nreform and sexual misbehaviour necessarily go together (401).  And the liberal Lady \nMorgan remembers how the Quarterly Review accused her, like Wollstonecraft, of \n\u201clicentiousness, profligacy, irreverence, blasphemy, libertinism, disloyalty, and \natheism\u201d, conflating religious and political radicalism with sexual dissolution\n(Morgan, vii-viii).  In this context, William Baxter\u2019s remark to his daughter that \nShelley possesses \u201ctruly republican frugality\u201d is unusual, for it associates \n\u201crepublicanism\u201d with abstinence and prudence, not sexual irresponsibility, as Booth \nand Lockhart declare (Shelley and His Circle, V, 340).\nThese accusations about Shelley\u2019s and Hunt\u2019s personal behaviour are, therefore, \ncontributions to a wider argument about how \u201cEuropean\u201d society should be \nconstructed, and what kind of behaviour is properly \u201cEuropean\u201d.  I have suggested \nthat Shelley\u2019s ideas of \u201cEurope\u201d reveal (as well as challenge) his interests in \nrevolution, radical reform, and the possibility of utopian social progress.  For his \ncritics though, \u201cEuropean\u201d denotes a yardstick of acceptable (sexual) conduct \u2013 and \nShelley\u2019s unorthodox personal life means that he can be attacked as \u201cuneuropean\u201d.  \nThis conservative use of \u201cEurope\u201d indicates the extent to which Shelley\u2019s own radical \n\u201cEurope\u201d is an attempt to reject what he considered to be pernicious social forms and \nstructures.  But the debates about his \u201cEuropeanness\u201d reveal how, in the post-\nNapoleonic political climate, the construction of \u201cEurope\u201d had become a battleground \nfor expressing various social ideologies, and not just radical ones.  Thinking about \n\u201cEurope\u201d does not just involve imagining political \u201cbeau ideals\u201d:  it also involves \ntheorising and practising competing behavioural codes and notions of social \nresponsibility.  In this way, Shelley\u2019s circle themselves are employed as subjects\nwhen recognising and defining \u201cEuropeanness\u201d.                                                 \n                                               \nNotes\n1 Gayatri Spivak notes how \u201cthe dark side of imperialism understood as social mission\u201d surfaces in \nFrankenstein \u2013 particularly in the figure of Henry Clerval, who aims to go to India, \u201cassisting the \nprogress of European colonization and trade\u201d.  However, she suggests, it also criticises imperialist \nprocedures because it refuses to countenance \u201cbinary oppositions\u201d of race and gender which often \n\u201cconsolidate the imperialist self\u201d.  Joseph Lew also observes how the Creature\u2019s physical appearance \nlinks it to the subjects of imperialist rule in British India.  However, it also \u201cexists outside [the\u2026] \ncategories\u201d of male and female or Occident \u201cself\u201d and Oriental \u201cother\u201d.  In this way, the novel \nquestions any absolute separation between a self and its \u201cothers\u201d, and therefore critiques \u201cthe growth \nand methods of the British Empire in the East\u201d.  For Spivak and Lew, Frankenstein reflects on the \n21\n                                                                                                                                      \ncomplexities inherent in identity politics \u2013 an intricacy which, I am suggesting, also informs its \npresentation of \u201cEurope\u201d and \u201cEuropean\u201d (Spivak, 254-6; Lew, 273-4 and 283).    \n2 All quotations from Laon and Cythna are from the text edited by Jack Donovan, which is contained \nwithin The Poems of Shelley, ed. Everest and Matthews.  Line numbers refer to this edition.\n3 Dipesh Chakrabarty observes how a \u201cuniversal and secular vision of the human\u201d is deeply associated \nwith the idea of \u201cEurope\u201d.  In other words, \u201cEurope\u201d seeks to define its values \u2013 citizenship, the state, \nequality before the law, scientific rationality \u2013 in terms of their \u201cuniversal\u201d relevance and potentially \nuniversal application.  Chakrabarty particularly mentions progress histories, which enshrine \u201cEurope\u201d \nas the culmination of human development, and view other societies as stages leading to a \u201cEuropean\u201d \nperfection.  As Leask notes, some of these assumptions can be detected in Shelley\u2019s writing.  \n(Chakrabarty, 4, 29 and 39).          \n4This \u201ccommunity of feeling\u201d evokes Cohen and Alliston\u2019s notion of \u201csympathy\u201d \u2013 which enables \ncross-border cultural interaction to exist alongside and in tension with \u201cconceptions of national \nidentity\u201d.  See Alliston\u2019s \u201cTransnational Sympathies, Imaginary Communities\u201d and Cohen\u2019s \n\u201cSentimental Communities\u201d in Cohen and Denver, eds.\n5 Hazlitt\u2019s argument strongly resembles Richard Price\u2019s idea that \u201cLiberty is the [\u2026] object of patriotic \nzeal [as] an enlightened country must be a free country\u201d.  Reflecting on the French Revolution, Price \nalso suggests that the spread of \u201cfreedom\u201d, already crucial in the establishment of patriotic identity, is \nalso instrumental in creating a new \u201cEurope\u201d (Price, 19 and 50).  \n6Ros Ballaster notes how eighteenth-century \u201coriental tales\u201d are typically received both as \u201cfeigned \nstories\u201d and \u201cfaithful representations\u201d of the East.  See Fables of the East, 2; and Fabulous Orients, 14-\n17.    \n7 Richard Polwhele, for example, suggests in 1798 that \u2018female advocates of Democracy\u2019 are inevitably \nsexual deviants.  Wollstonecraft submits to her \u201cheart\u2019s lusts\u201d, while Helen Maria Williams is \u201can \nintemperate advocate for Gallic [revolutionary] licentiousness\u201d.  For Polwhere, radical politics and \nsexual unorthodoxy are both direct challenges to societal order. (Polwhele, 9-10, 19 and 30).     \nReferences\nAshe, Thomas. Travels in America. 3 vols.
