The simulator produces motion of a\ncemented hip construct in the extension\/\u008f exion plane, with a socket to rotate internal\/externally. At\nthe same time a dynamic loading cycle is applied to the construct. A validation test was performed\non a cemented femoral stem within a novel composite femur. The study demonstrates the value of\nusing a hip joint simulator to evaluate the outcome of the cemented hip construct. A complex\nmigration pattern of the cemented hip prosthesis with respect to load cycling was observed, demon-\nstrated in vitro comparable prosthesis migration behaviour, both the stem migration and migration\npatterns, to that found clinically.\nKeywords: hip joint simulator, loosening, stem migration, total hip replacement\n1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the absence of an accepted in vitro bench test to pre-\ndict the outcome of the cemented hip replacement, the\nevaluation of new materials and prosthesis designs relies\nupon animal experiments and clinical trials [1\u20134 ].\nHowever, using such methods is recognized as an\nine \u0081 cient and costly way to screen out inferior implant\ndesigns. Several in vitro studies have been reported\nrecently to measure the relative prosthesis\/bone move-\nment of the hip joint replacements [4, 5 ]. The experimen-\ntal set-up is usually mounted on an Instron servohyraulic\nmaterials testing machine using the one-leg standing con-\ndition and a compressive sinusoidal load is directly\napplied on the femoral head, at a frequency of 5 Hz\n[6\u20139 ]. Britton and Prendergast [10] designed a novel\nloading generating rig that can produce a physiologically\nrealistic loading con\u008e guration for walking, including\nmuscle forces and hip contact force, and transmits this\nload to the implanted femur. McKellop et al. [11] meas-\nured the relative prosthesis\u2013bone motion in the axial,\nmedial\u2013lateral and rotational directions, with the lower\nmounting plate swinging in the anterior\u2013posterior direc-\nThe MS was received on 21 March 2002 and was accepted after revision\nfor publication on 13 December 2002.\n* Corresponding author: School of Engineering, University of Durham,\nSouth Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK.\nH02602\u00a9 IMechE 2003 Proc.

Engineering in Medicine\ntion while the prosthesis was under simultaneous axial\nand bending load.\nThe loading on the hip joint during gait is far more\ncomplicated than the loading conditions adopted in the\nreported in vitro tests. The movement within a hip joint\nreplacement includes the femoral \u008f exion, extension,\nabduction, adduction, internal and external rotations\n[12, 13]. Moreover, the rotation of the acetabular cup\nrelative to the femoral head exerts a torsion torque on\nthe femoral component. This demonstrates the need for\na physiological load simulation in order to test the\ncemented hip implants in vitro safely. However, the\nreported in vitro pre-clinical test procedures simulate\nonly one or two loading conditions.\nA hip joint simulator can produce physiological\ndynamic loading and simulate the human hip activity\nunder a similar environment to that of the human body.\nThe design and validation work of the simulator at\nDurham has been reported elsewhere [14, 15]. Hip simu-\nlators have concentrated on wear and has long been\nused to assess wear or tribological properties of the arti-\n\u008e cial joints [16\u201319]. Clearly, however, a simulator of\nmigration would be an important clinical test in\nimplant designs.\nClinical observation using Roentgen stereophoto-\ngrammetric analysis (RSA) suggests that using the sub-\nsidence of the prosthesis at two years post-operation\ncan predict the outcome of the cemented total hip\n128 C LIU, S M GREEN, N D WATKINS, P J GREGG AND A W McCASKIE\narthroplasty [7, 20\u201322]. Pre-clinical test methodologies\nthat can be used to predict the outcome of cemented\ntotal hip replacements, paralleling the methods now used\nin the evaluation of hip joint tribology, is a recognized\nneed [5 ].\nFundamental to this work is the development of the\nhip joint simulator that can simulate the human hip both\nin movement and the loading condition, which can be\napplied to the study of the migration of the cemented\nhip prosthesis. A novel composite bone model has been\ndeveloped by the authors for this purpose and presented\nhere are the hip joint simulator based preliminary results\nof the cemented femoral stem. It is suggested that the\ndevelopment of the hip joint simulator and the exper-\nimental approach show promise in the evaluation of new\nprostheses and bone cements prior to the clinical\nintroduction.\n2 HIP JOINT SIMULATOR\n2.1 Motion\nThe Durham hip joint simulator 3 is a modi\u008e ed vision\nof the Durham hip joint simulator Mk 2. It was designed\nwith the intention of building a simple, station-\nadjustable (to test di \u0080 erent types of prosthesis and syn-\nthetic bones) and reliable machine while maintaining a\nrealistic simulation of the hip joint replacements in\nregard to motion, load and lubrication.\nThe hip joint simulator 3 has \u008e ve articulating stations\nand one creep station, as shown in Fig. 1. The cemented\nhip complex connects to the load actuator cylinder via\nthe universal joint, a feature that facilitates the self-\nalignment and adjustment of the mounting angle. The\nFig. 1 The Durham hip joint simulator 3 with \u008e ve articulating stations and one creep station\nH02602 \u00a9 IMechE 2003Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine\nload actuator sits \u008f atly on the bottom plate and can slide\nto and is \u008e xed at the required position, so that the femur\ncan be mounted anatomically as required. The acetabu-\nlar cup, which was inclined at 30\u00b0 from the vertical, was\nconnected to the cup holder on the top. This approxi-\nmates the anatomical position of the hip joint as well as\nproviding the desired motion when in operation. The\nset-up of the station is shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 2 The schematic of the station set-up\n129A PRELIMINARY HIP JOINT SIMULATOR STUDY OF THE MIGRATION OF A CEMENTED FEMORAL STEM\nAn a.c. motor drives an output shaft at 1 Hz on which\na timing belt pulley and crank arrangement was\nmounted. The crank arrangement drives the extension\/\n\u008f exion drive bar directly and oscillates the \u008e ve stations\nwith an approximate sinusoidal motion through \u00ad 15\u00b0\nto 30\u00b0 in the extension\/\u008f exion plane, as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe timing belt pulley allowed the drive to pass to a\nparallel shaft above and drove the internal\/external\nrotation drive bar via the crank arrangement on the\nshaft. This caused the acetabular components to be oscil-\nlated with an approximate sinusoidal motion through\n\u00ad 5\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 in the internal\/external rotation. Thus in the\nbiaxial motion, the femoral component swings in the\nextension\/\u008f exion plane and the acetabular component\nrotates internally\/externally, which simulates the move-\nment of the hip in level walking. The timing belt and\nslots on the internal\/external rotation crank fastenings\nallowed a phase di \u0080 erence of 90 between the two motion\ncycles to be accurately set, as shown in Fig. 4.\n2.2 Load and loading pro\u008e le\nOn the top shaft, a slot disc was used to activate three\noptoswitches, used to control the loading cycle. Rotating\nthe slotted disc position relative to the internal\/external\nrotation crank allowed the loading cycle to be synchron-\nized with the motion cycles. The optoswitches control a\nNorgren pneumatic proportional valve via a program-\nmable interface controller. The output from the Norgren\nproportional valve was ampli\u008e ed pneumatically using an\nSMC booster valve. A manifold then supplied pressure\nequally to a Hoerbiger pneumatic actuator in each of\nthe stations. Load is applied on at maximum \u008f exion\nFig. 3 The crank arrangement drives the femoral component which swings through \u00ad 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 in the\nextension\/\u008f exion plane\nH02602\u00a9 IMechE 2003 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine\n(equivalent to heel strike) and o \u0080 at maximum extension\n(toe o \u0080 ).\nThe resultant forces of the normal hip were varied in\nthe range 150\u2013800 per cent of body weight depending\non the walking speed, walking modes and measuring\ntechniques [13, 23]. Saikko et al. [24] observed joint\nloading over the \u008e rst 30 months following implantation,\nand the peak forces increased with walking from about\n280 per cent of the patient\u2019s body weight (BW) at 1 km\/h\nto approximately 480 per cent BW at 5 km\/h. Jogging\nand very fast walking both raised the forces to about\n550 per cent BW. About 200\u2013250 per cent BW forces\nwere recorded in vivo using a telemetric technique by\nEnglish et al. [25]. In this study, the compressive load\nlevel peaking at 2500 N was chosen, which is 3.5 times\nBW of 75 kg body mass, to approximate the stress level\nthat a well-bonded stem may reach in vivo. The load\nwaveform was taken from Crowninshield et al. [26 ],\nexcept that the valley between the two peaks is omitted\nfor simplicity. In their waveform the duration of the\nloaded part of the cycle, from heel strike to toe o \u0080 , is\nabout 63 per cent of the length of the cycle. This was\npreserved in the present study so that the load on the\nstem remains close to the physiological loading at heel\nstrike and toe o \u0080 . The pneumatic output from the sta-\ntions followed a square wave loading cycle at a frequency\nof 1 Hz, as shown in Fig. 5.\nThe acetabular component was \u008e rmly connected to\nthe cup holder, and the high part of the acetabular com-\nponent was carefully calibrated according to the pro-\ncedures described in reference [27] in order to make sure\nthat the centre of the stem head is in line with the hinge\nof the articulate station when the stem head comes\nin contact with the acetabular cup. The cemented hip\n130 C LIU, S M GREEN, N D WATKINS, P J GREGG AND A W McCASKIE\nFig. 4 The motion cycles used on the simulator 3\nFig. 5 Loading cycle at a frequency of 1 Hz was applied on\neach station. Heel strike is located at the end of the\nzero-load phase and toe o \u0080 at the start of the zero-\nload phase\nconstruct was mounted on to the station of the simu-\nlator, via a universal joint, at an adduction angle of 11\u00b0,\nchosen to allow a comparison with other studies [28, 29].\nThe femur was oscillated with an approximate sinusoidal\nmotion through \u00ad 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 in the extension\/\u008f exion\nplane. The acetabular components were oscillated with\nsinusoidal motion in the internal\/external rotation plane\nthrough \u00ad 5\u00b0 to 5\u00b0. The articulating station combined\n\u008f exion\/extension of the femoral component, with\ninternal\/external rotation of the acetabular cup. The load\nvector was not simply in the vertical direction, but oscil-\nlated with the angle of swing of the femur. The combi-\nnation of motion and loading cycles resulted in a three-\ndimensional locus of the load vector over the acetabular\ncomponent, as observed in vivo and as used by Brummit\nand Hardaker [30].\n2.3 Lubrication\nThe use of synovial \u008f uid to replicate the in vivo lubricant\nexactly in the simulator is not viable due to the cost and\ndi \u0081 culty of obtaining the quantities required for testing.\nA previous study [31] revealed that a carboxymethyl\nH02602 \u00a9 IMechE 2003Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine\ncellulose (CMC) \u008f uid with a viscosity of 9.9 cp demon-\nstrated a similar friction factor to that of synovial \u008f uid.\nThus CMC \u008f uid with a viscosity of 9.9 cp was chosen\nas the lubricant in the present study. The space between\nthe acetabular component and the femoral component\nwas sealed using a rubber gaiter \u008e lled with CMC \u008f uid.\nEvaporation of the lubricant is compensated for using a\nreplenishment bottle. Thus, the articulating surface was\nimmersed in the lubricate to ensure that the articulation\nremains lubricated during the test.\n3 FEMUR MODEL AND STEMMIGRATION\nMEASUREMENT\nThe bone model comprised a commercial bone cortex\n(Bone Models Limited, UK) \u008e lled with an epoxy resin\ncancellous bone model (CBME Durham, UK). The fem-\noral canal was prepared according to the procedures\ndescribed elsewhere [32, 33]. Vacu-Mix Plus pre-packed\nwith CMW 1 radiopaque bone cement (CMW, UK) was\nused in the present study to cement the prostheses and\nits compositions and mechanical properties are discussed\nelsewhere [34]. The bone cement was introduced into\nthe prepared femur canal in a retrograde fashion and\nkept at constant pressure. The Charnley FLNGD 40\nstem was inserted into the femur at a cross-head speed\nof 500 mm\/min to a pre-set position.\nThe migration measurement device was based on the\nconcept employed by Maher et al. [5 ] to measure the\nmigration of a cemented hip prosthesis in vitro test, in\nwhich they used six linear variable di \u0080 erential trans-\nformer displacement transducers (LVDTs) and specially\nbuilt LVDT holders to measure the migration of the\ntarget device. The design developed in the present study\nuse a depth micrometer with a resolution of 1 \u00edm,\ninstead of LVDTs, to measure the relative migrations of\nthe measuring device.\nA purpose-built measuring device (Fig. 6), a three-\nball measuring jig, was rigidly attached to the femoral\ncomponent, while the reference window was rigidly\n131A PRELIMINARY HIP JOINT SIMULATOR STUDY OF THE MIGRATION OF A CEMENTED FEMORAL STEM\nFig. 6 The coordinate of the migration measuring protocol\nattached to the femur. Thus the relative migration\nbetween the femoral component and the bone cortex can\nbe obtained by measuring the displacement of the three-\nball jig relative to the reference window. The \u008e xed coor-\ndinate axis x of the jig is aligned with the line joining\nthe centre of ball 3. The \u008e xed coordinate axis y of the\nbody is aligned with the line joining the centre of ball 2\nand the centre of the attaching rod between the jig and\nthe prosthesis. The jig \u008e xed axis z is mutually perpen-\ndicular to the x and y axes and is aligned with the line\njoining ball 1. Point O is the reference point of the jig.\nA matrix representing the {x, y, z} coordinates of the\ncentres of each of the balls 1, 2 and 3 is constructed,\nwhere {0, 0, z1}, {0, y2 , 0} and {x3 , 0, 0} are the centre\ncoordinates of balls 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\nAs the measuring jig was rigidly attached to the pros-\nthesis, the jig will migrate with the prosthesis. If the\nprosthesis migrates, when subject to loading cycles, the\nmigration can be described as a rotation (hx, hy and hz\nis the rotation angle around axes x, y and z respectively)\nand a translation ({u0 , v0 , w0} is the translation of the\norigin O in axes x, y and z respectively). Then, the\ndisplacement of the three balls can be expressed as\nfollows:\nGu1 u2 u3v1 v2 v3w1 w2 w3H= [R] C 0 0 x30 y2 0z1 0 0 D+Gu0 u0 u0v0 v0 v0w0 w0 w0H\n\u00ad G 0 0 x30 y2 0z1 0 0 H (1)\nwhere\n[R]= C 1 \u00ad hz hyhz 1 \u00ad hx\u00ad h\ny\nh\nx\n1 D\nSolving the above equation gives the migration of the\nH02602\u00a9 IMechE 2003 Proc.

The migrations of the\nprosthesis head centre and distal end are evaluated\ngeometrically and calculated correspondingly.\n4 PRELIMINARY RESULTS\nTwo cemented hip prostheses were tested in the present\nstudy, and the subsidence variations of the stem with the\nloading cycles are shown in Fig. 7. This \u008e gure shows that\nthe stem subsides with respect to the loading cycles. The\nsubsidence of the stem for both the stem head and the\ndistal stem increased with the number of loading cycles.\nIt was observed that a di \u0080 erence existed between the\nsubsidence of the stem head and the distal stem.\nThe stem head demonstrated a higher subsidence than\nthe distal stem at each loading cycle. Total subsidence\nafter 3 million loading cycles reached 176 and 70 \u00edm for\nthe stem head and distal stem respectively.\nWith reference to Fig. 7, two subsidence stages, an\ninitial higher subsidence stage followed by a steady sub-\nsidence stage, can be identi\u008e ed. The subsidence of the\nstem head and distal stem reached 76 and 42 mm respect-\nively at 100 000 loading cycles, representing about 43\nand 60 per cent of the total subsidence respectively at\n3 million cycles. The subsidence of the stem head\nincreases dramatically with the loading cycles in the\ninitial stage until about 100000 loading cycles and was\nabout 1.8 times higher than that of the distal stem.\nThe subsidence reaches a steady stage and thereafter\nincreases slowly with the number of loading cycles.\nAs a rigid body, the di \u0080 erence in the subsidence of\nthe stem head and the distal stem may be a result of the\nstem rotation. Figure 8 shows the measured stem\nrotations with respect to the loading cycles. Stem\nrotation contributed to the three-dimensional migration\nof the stem with loading over the test duration.\nTypically, the stem rotated within the composite bone\nabout the y axis, which results in the stem head migrating\nmedially and the distal stem laterally. The stem internal\nrotation about the z axis, added by rotation about the\n132 C LIU, S M GREEN, N D WATKINS, P J GREGG AND A W McCASKIE\nFig. 7 The migration of the stem head and the distal stem with the loading cycles\nFig. 8 Rotation of the prosthesis with the loading cycles (positive for right-hand rule and negative for left-\nhand rule)\nx axis, contributed to the head migrating posteriorly.\nThe total angle of rotation at 3 million cycles for the\nstem was 0.046\u00b0, 0.14\u00b0 and 0.26\u00b0 about the x, y and z\naxes respectively. The rotation of the stem also featured\nwith two rotation stages, i.e. a higher rate stage of\nrotation followed by a lower rate stage of rotation. For\nthe rotation about the x axis, about 92 per cent of the\ntotal rotation occurred during the \u008e rst 0.2 million cycles;\n60 and 51 per cent of the total rotation angle were\nrecorded for the rotation about the y and z axes respect-\nively at 0.2 million cycles. Beyond that, the rotation rate\nseemed to decrease to a steady stage.\n5 DISCUSSION\nFailure of total hip replacement (THR) is a complex\nprocess and is currently poorly understood. The long-\nterm endurance of total hip arthroplasty depends on last-\ning mechanical integrity of the bone between the implant\nand the bone, the implant\u2013bone cement interface. The\nH02602 \u00a9 IMechE 2003Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine\nmigration of cemented femoral components is a complex\ncombination and translation in three dimensions.\nClinical studies using radiostereophotogrammetry have\nshown that those cemented hip prostheses that migrate\nrapidly in the \u008e rst two post-operative years are the ones\nthat require early revision [35]. Loudon and Older [36 ]\nreported that subsidence of the femoral component was\nrelated to the long-term outcome of hip replacement. An\nunsatisfactory outcome was associated with subsidence\nof more than 5 mm, when clinical failure is likely.\nKarrholm et al. [37] measured the migration at two years\nand found that those femoral components that failed\nhad subsided more than 2 mm in two years. Those that\nfunctioned well had a mean migration of 0.08 mm. In\nthe present study, the subsidence of the stem was far\nfrom reaching the 2 mm threshold. Does this result sug-\ngest that the stem tested in this study was stable? As a\ngeneral assumption, 1 million loading cycles is a realistic\nestimate of the number of walking cycles endured by the\nhip joint annually. In comparing the present data to\nthe clinical measurements, it is clear that the average\n133A PRELIMINARY HIP JOINT SIMULATOR STUDY OF THE MIGRATION OF A CEMENTED FEMORAL STEM\nmigration measured in this study is comparable to that\nin the clinical data, as observed in Table 1.\nThe substantially larger migration of the femoral com-\nponent at an early test stage con\u008e rms other clinical\nobservations [35, 38, 39]. The rapid early migration in\nvivo is probably caused by resorption of the bone layer,\nwhich has been injured by surgical trauma and the heat\nof polymerization of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)\ncement. After the initial stage, when the initial settling\nis complete, the implants tend to migrate slowly without\nsubstantial bone loss and probably result from a combi-\nnation of cement creep, allowing the implant to sink\nwithin its mantle. In comparing the variation of the stem\nsubsidence with the loading cycles to the creep variation\nof cement with the loading cycles [40, 41], a clear simi-\nlarity was observed. This may suggest that the later\nmigration pattern could be creep driven.\nSeveral in vitro studies [5, 39, 42 ] have attempted to\nmeasure the prosthesis\/bone movement of femoral hip\nreplacements. Various methods have been devised using\ncustom-designed machines. The experimental set-up\ncomprised an Instron servohydraulic materials testing\nmachine. The femur was clamped to the base of the\nmachine using the one-leg standing condition and a com-\npressive sinusoidal load was directly applied on the fem-\noral head, at a frequency of 5 Hz [6\u20139 ]. Britton and\nPrendergast [10] designed a novel loading generating rig\nthat could produce a physiologically realistic loading\ncon\u008e guration for walking, including muscle forces and\nhip contact force, and transmits this load to the\nimplanted femur. However, none of the reported studies\nrealized the physiological simulation of the hip joint con-\nditions with regard to motion, load and lubrication.\nSeveral factors, including bone quality, loading locus,\nstem and cement types, cementing techniques, etc.,\nshould be considered when interpreting the data and\ncomparing with the published results. The current study\nwas carried out on a hip joint simulator, in which the\nfemur are subjected to compressive loads of varying\nmagnitude, with the direction varying in a cycle; the\nrotation of the acetabular component exerted a torsional\nmoment to the femoral component. In vivo, the femur\nalso experienced muscle forces, which counterbalanced\nthe contact force. The counterbalance e \u0080 ect of the\nmuscle forces acting on the femur may have an in\u008f uence\nTable 1 Comparison of the stem migration between the present study and clinical\nmeasurements\nExperimental data Clinical data [35]\nSites 1 million 2 million 3 million First year After \u008e rst year\nStem head (mm) 0.101 0.139 0.176 0.54\u00b10.16 0.09\u00b10.04\nDistal stem (mm) 0.061 0.07 0.07 0.04\u00b10.14 0.15\u00b10.05\nRotation angle (\u00b0)\nhx \u00ad 0.045 \u00ad 0.052 \u00ad 0.046 \u00ad 0.1\u00b10.14 0.10\u00b10.08\nhy 0.18 0.26 0.26 1.17\u00b10.69 0.20\u00b10.29\nhz 0.09 0.14 0.14 0.32\u00b10.12 \u00ad 0.02\u00b10.04\nH02602\u00a9 IMechE 2003 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 217 Part H: J. Engineering in Medicine\non the load distribution, such as a reduced bending\nmoment. This may cause the stem to migrate in a di \u0080 er-\nent way or produce a di \u0080 erent movement. However,\nthere has been no literature report on the e \u0080 ects of\nmuscle on stem migration. As the femoral component\nswings in the extension\/\u008f exion plane and the acetabular\ncomponent rotation is internal\/external, which was\nadded by the lubrication regime adopted in this study,\nattempts to apply the muscle forces to the femur in a\nsimulator test have proved to be di \u0081 cult at the present\nstage.\nAs a simpli\u008e ed loading simulation, the square wave\nloading pro\u008e le has been widely adopted in the evaluation\nof biomaterials. Smith and Unsworth [43] compared the\nsimpli\u008e ed motion and loading to that of the physiologi-\ncal loading of a hip joint simulator. Visual inspection of\nthe worn surface of the cups revealed that no notable\ndi \u0080 erence was observed between these two motion and\nloading modes in regard to the wear of the hip joints,\nand it was concluded that simpli\u008e ed loading is therefore\nan acceptable mode in simulator testing. It has a clear\nadvantage over the sinusoidal loading pro\u008e le of the\nphysiological loading. Therefore a compressive sinus-\noidal load was adopted in the reported in vitro test of\nthe hip replacements and the simpli\u008e ed load pro\u008e le was\nadopted in the present study. However, no literature\nreports the e \u0080 ect of the loading pro\u008e le on stem migration\nand more evaluation work should be carried out in the\nfuture.\nPrevious in vitro studies [27, 44] revealed that the bone\nquality (mechanical strength and modulus) and creep\nbehaviour of a cement mantle plays a very important\nrole in the migration of the cemented hip prosthesis and\nthe remodelling process of the bone cortex. The stems\nwithin a weak bone cortex migrate much more than\nthose within a strong bone cortex. The pattern or direc-\ntion of migration changed with loading cycles, and this\nchange in pattern is larger than the change in rate, which\nis also observed clinically [35]. The di \u0080 erence suggests\nthat di \u0080 erent mechanisms cause the migration at di \u0080 er-\nent periods and di \u0080 erent restrained conditions.\nAs a \u008e rst-attempt in vitro test, the hip joint simulator\nhas demonstrated clear advantages over the reported in\nvitro test methods [4, 5, 42, 45, 46 ] with regards to load-\ning locus, motions and lubrications, the test shows a very\n134 C LIU, S M GREEN, N D WATKINS, P J GREGG AND A W McCASKIE\npromising method for pre-clinical evaluation of the\noutcome of cemented hip replacements.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nA new design of hip joint simulator and a method for\nmeasuring the migration behaviour of a cemented hip\nprosthesis in vitro has been described. The study demon-\nstrates the value of using a hip joint simulator to evaluate\nthe outcome of the cemented hip construct. A complex\nmigration pattern of the cemented hip prosthesis with\nrespect to load cycling was observed. This experimental\noutcome is signi\u008e cant because it is the \u008e rst study using\na hip joint simulator that has demonstrated in vitro com-\nparable prosthesis migration behaviour, both the stem\nmigration and migration patterns, to that found clini-\ncally, suggesting that the reported experimental set-up\nand the method can be used for pre-clinical evaluation\nof the biomaterials in cemented hip replacements. Work\nis ongoing using matched moduli cortex and cancellous\nelements of the bone model, developed to better replicate\nthe physiological situation.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThanks are due to DePuy CMW UK for kindly supply-\ning the bone cements and stems and to Bone Models\nLimited UK for supplying the bone models.
