Introduction\n1.1 History and theory of accident proneness\nThe beginning of safety research has often been traced to British studies about the\ndistributions of accidents in various populations (mainly industrial workers) in the early 20th\ncentury (e.g. Greenwood & Woods, 1919; Newbold, 1927; Slocombe & Brakeman, 1930).\nOne of the main hypotheses was that accidents were not random events for workers, but in\nsome way were due to stable individual difference in their behaviour. This was the origin of\nthe research tradition of accident proneness.\nThe early work concluded that some people are clumsy, or risk seeking, and therefore cause\nmore damage to themselves and their surroundings than their more safety-minded peers, a\nnotion with quasi-theoretical properties. For example, one major prediction that could be\ndrawn from this general line of thinking was that people would tend to be stable over time in\ntheir accident proneness, meaning that their numbers (or rates) of accidents would tend to be\nthe same in different time periods, at least within the same environment. This reasonable way\nof thinking did also yield some positive results when empirical testing was undertaken (e.g.\nNewbold, 1927; Wong & Hobbs, 1949; Adelstein, 1952), before many researchers turned to\nstatistical quarrelling (Mintz & Blum, 1949; Maritz, 1950; Mintz, 1954; 1956), and progress\nwas halted.\nThe accident proneness concept was imported into the fledgling traffic research field (Farmer\n& Chambers, 1929; 1939), along with the basic controversy of whether it actually exists.\nWhile statisticians were mainly interested in how various theoretical distributions could be\nfitted against data, and what the results could possibly mean, many traffic researchers studied\nthe stability of accidents over time (which had generated the positive results for industrial\naccidents). At first, it was claimed that a small number of drivers within a time period were\nresponsible for a fairly large number of accidents (e.g. Baker, 1929; 1932; Tillman &\n4Hobbes, 1949). However, it was soon found that there were actually very low correlations\nbetween accidents in different time periods (e.g. Forbes, 1939; Kerr, 1957). Also, removing\nthe drivers with many accidents in one time period would actually have very little effect in\nreducing crashes, because those with multiple accidents were few and far between. With\ntime, the traffic accident proneness concept fell into disrepute, with many critics (Kirchner,\n1961; Cameron, 1975; McKenna, 1983) and hardly any defenders (for a review, see Porter,\n1988). Most traffic researchers who studied the question empirically came to the conclusion\nthat there was very little stability over time (e.g. Harrington, 1972) as did accident\nresearchers in general (e.g. Arbous & Kerrich, 1951), due to the fact that most of the\ncorrelations between time periods were extremely small. Today, there seem to be little\ninterest in the question of whether (traffic) accident record is a stable individual differences\nvariable (Gebers, 2003, is one of the exceptions).\nIn the present paper, some of the assumptions, methods and conclusions by previous\nresearchers regarding whether accident record is stable over time will be challenged as\nerroneous, and alternative ways of investigating this question suggested and used. The\nsubjects covered are; how to analyse and interpret the sizes of accident correlations between\ntime periods, using all accidents versus culpable ones, and the effect of correlating accidents\nin non-adjacent periods.\nThe notion of accident proneness used in the present study does not assume anything about\nits relation to personality or other personal variables, but is simply the statement that people\nare differently prone to causing accidents, in a similar environment, and that this is a trait that\nis stable over time.\nMethodological and statistical background\n5The rejection of the stability over time part of accident proneness did not take into\nconsideration a number of facts, which, if properly evaluated, point in quite another direction;\nfirstly, early studies on workers' accidents did often find sizeable (>.20) correlations between\ntime periods (e.g. Greenwood & Woods, 1919; Newbold, 1927; Farmer & Chambers, 1939);\nsecondly, a number of studies of professional drivers have reported fairly strong (>.40)\nassociations over time (e.g. Creswell & Froggatt, 1963; Bach, Bickel & Biehl, 1975;\nMilosevic & Vucinic, 1975; Blasco, Prieto & Cornejo, 2003); thirdly, low correlations have\nalmost all been found in car driver populations (e.g. Forbes, 1939; Burg, 1970; Stewart &\nCampbell, 1972; Peck, 1993); finally, culpability for accidents have seldom been included in\nthe analyses. The first three observations are all part of the same problem, and the solution\nwhen it comes to reconciling them is that the weak associations have most often been\ncalculated on rather short time periods for low-risk groups, resulting in very low means and\nstandard deviations, which necessarily mean low statistical associations (Peck, 1993). The\nvery differing levels of correlations in different studies are therefore a natural result of\ndifferences in mean number of accidents in the samples for the time periods used. In the\nwords of Arbous and Kerrich (1951): \"In fairness to the theory of proneness, however, it must\nbe pointed out that as the successive exposure periods are increased, the correlation\ncoefficient will also increase...\" (p. 369). Although this statement was about increasing the\nvariance within a sample by using longer time periods for calculations, the same principle is\nvalid for comparisons between samples; those with higher means\/variances will yield\nstronger associations between periods. So, if association data from several studies is gathered,\nit can be shown that it is the time period used for calculation and\/or the mean number of\naccidents in the sample which almost exclusively (70-80 percent of the variance) determines\nthe size of the correlation between time periods (af W\u00e5hlberg, forthcoming, see Figure 1).\n6Figure 1 about here\nThe conclusion drawn from this result is that the liability to have accidents is not only\ndifferently distributed in a population, but it is also surprisingly stable over time within each\nindividual (note that most drivers in a year will have no accidents, as will they in the next\nyear, an amazing stability that is not reflected by a correlation). The scientific and statistical\nproblem is that this level of proneness is so low that it cannot be reliably determined or even\ndetected using such time periods and populations as most researchers have utilized. However,\nif the principle of the mean accident level as predictor of the correlation between time periods\nholds good between samples and populations, it should also be the case for samples from a\nsingle population, if these have different mean levels of accident frequency. This hypothesis\ncan be tested by drawing different samples from a population, correlating their accidents for\ndifferent time periods and plotting these correlations against the accident means.\nFurthermore, the correlations can be calculated for differing time periods for each sample and\ncompared to the means.\nIt can be noted that most researchers studying the association of crashes between time periods\nhave used all accidents in their calculations, regardless of culpability. However, the concept\nof accident proneness was really about causing accidents, not about random events, which\nhad nothing to do with the behaviour of the accidentee. Therefore, unless some sort of stable\ndifferential environmental risk creates a biased risk exposure, the accidents for which the\ndriver is not responsible should not be included, because they add error variance. However,\nof the few researchers who have compared the stability of all accidents with that of culpable\nonly (H\u00e4kkinen, 1958; Harrington, 1972; Gebers & Peck, 1994; Gebers, 2003; see also West,\nElander & French, 1992, who used the active\/passive distinction), no one has concluded that\nthis method had an advantage over using All accidents.\n7There are several possible reasons for this, for example that culpability is very difficult to\nascertain, which adds error variation, due to erroneous categorizing. However, two other\nmethodological problems can be suspected as the main culprits; lower means for culpable\naccidents, and that the criterion is erroneous. As stated, the size of an accident\nintercorrelation between time periods would seem to be dependent on the sample mean, and\nnot much else. But this means that a comparison between all and culpable accidents for the\nsame sample is unfair, because the latter will have less variation to work with statistically.\nRegarding the criterion, culpability should mean that the drivers were to some extent a cause\nof the event due to their driving behaviour. However, criterions for this would seem to differ\nbetween studies, because, although the criterion itself is almost never reported, the differing\npercentages of culpable drivers between studies (compare for example Cation, Mount &\nBrenner, 1951; Brandaleone & Flamm, 1955; Quimby, Maycock, Carter, Dixon & Wall,\n1986; Dobson, Brown, Ball, Powers & McFadden, 1999), as well as the correlations between\nculpable and non-culpable in different studies (e.g. Goldstein & Mosel, 1958; McBain, 1970;\nGully, Whitney & Vanosdall, 1995; Arthur & Graziano, 1996), show that in many cases, the\ncriterion does not achieve what it set out to do with any large degree of precision (af\nW\u00e5hlberg & Dorn, 2007). So, although most of the researchers who have used culpable\naccidents have found lower correlations between time periods, as compared to all accidents,\nand concluded that the effect of such restrictions are negative, they have not taken into\naccount the effect of the lowered mean, or checked their culpability criterion for correctness.\nIn fact, the first is not really possible to do until a fair amount of research has been conducted\nand a meta-analysis has determined the regression equations for the separate accident\npopulations' stabilities. With these regressions the stability correlation for a given mean of\naccidents can be compared, and it can be ascertained which set of accidents achieve the\nhighest stability with this given variation. Whether culpability has been assigned correctly\n8within a set of accidents has hitherto been hard to ascertain. However, such methods have\nnow been invented and tested upon the present data, showing a certain amount of error (af\nW\u00e5hlberg & Dorn, 2007). This will be further described in the method section.\nReturning to the problem of stability of accident record over time, it can be noted that if there\nis little stability, then correlations between time periods further apart would be expected to be\nlower than for those in closer proximity, as claimed by Milosevic and Vucinic (1975) to be\nthe case for their data. This question has rarely been posed, and so it was added to the present\nstudy. No prediction was made concerning these results, because the accident proneness\nconcept does not really take into consideration this question.\nIt can be noted that professional populations (like the bus drivers in the present study) might\nbe subject to attrition due to accidents (i.e. those who have many incidents leave the\ncompany), as shown for industrial workers by van Zelst (1954). For the presently used\npopulation, this has not been studied, and the only research on bus drivers\u2019 attrition seem to\nbe af W\u00e5hlberg (2005), where there was only a non-significant difference. However, if\ndrivers with many crashes have left the company that supplied the present data, this would\nlead to an underestimation of the effect, due to restricted variance in the samples.\nFurthermore, the issue of unequal risk exposure has always been a problem of accident\nproneness studies; could it be the case that stability over time is due to some persons move\nabout in riskier environments? For bus drivers, the only known calculation on this problem\nwas undertaken by H\u00e4kkinen (1958), who concluded that the influence of differential risk\nbetween different bus routes was negligable. In the present study, unequal risk exposure\ncannot be ruled out, although the drivers did serve on several different routes (see further the\nmethod section).\nTo sum up, the aim of the present paper was to consider the validity of the major tenet of the\naccident proneness theory by investigating whether propensity to be involved in a crash is\n9stable over time, utilizing two methods. First, it was investigated whether the\nintercorrelations between accidents in different time periods are determined by the mean level\nof accidents in the sample. It was predicted that when intercorrelations between periods were\nplotted against the mean accident levels for the total periods, they would conform to an\nalmost perfect linear trend. Second, the trend for culpable accidents should be higher\nintercorrelations for the same mean when compared to all accidents. Also, the effect of time\nin between accident time periods on their intercorrelations was studied.\n2. Method\n2.1 Subjects and data\nA UK bus company made traffic accident data available for analyses from five different\ngeographical regions for the time period 2001-2005. All drivers in the samples had been\ndriving for the whole period under investigation. These drivers used several different types of\nvehicles, from minibuses to double deckers, and drove both rural and urban routes. All\nincidents whilst at work are reported within this company. For accidents, a special form is\ncompleted, describing various circumstances, like driver manoeuvres before the crash. From\nthis and other material, the area manager in collaboration with an insurance team assigns\nresponsibility for the crash to the bus driver, at three levels; none fault, part fault and sole\nfault.\nEach bus driver is allocated to a rota during their working week. Across all UK depots the\nrota typically includes between 2 and 4 routes. Some depots, particularly in heavily built up\nareas, may have between 10 and 15 routes to be driven across a rota. For the present samples,\nthe number of routes driven per working week ranged from 2 to 15 and these tend to be\n10\ndriven by the same bus drivers operating from the same rotas week in and week out. A driver\nmay swop their rota with another driver if they would like a change of shift. Whilst most\ndrivers are experienced in the routes they drive, if they swop rotas as a novice bus driver they\nmay not have encountered the route before. Given that there is a greater percentage of\nexperienced drivers compared with novice drivers within a typical depot and swopping rotas\ntends to happen only occasionally, this eventuality is less common.\nOnly a very small percentage of drivers change depots often due to staff shortages in built up\nareas. With this as the exception, the vast majority of bus drivers stay with the same depot for\nthe duration of their service. When they are transferred to another depot, every driver\nundergoes route risk assessment training. Route risk assessment includes a video of the road\nfeatures that are problematic and associated with previous crashes. A mentor also\naccompanies the driver on the first drive of the route.\nData was arranged with driver as the unit of analysis, split by calendar year and culpability.\nFor the present study, two accident variables were used; All (all levels of culpability added),\nand At fault (Part and Sole fault added). The basic variable was thus the number of accidents\nwithin a year for each driver. For some calculations, these years were added to longer\nperiods.\nHowever, for the present data, it has been shown that the criterion for culpability used by the\ncompany is too lenient (af W\u00e5hlberg & Dorn, 2007), meaning that several percent of\naccidents that should have been classified as culpable have not been designated as such.\nTherefore, the present data were not optimal for showing the proposed effects concerning\nculpability. The means of accidents and some other descriptive data are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1 about here\n11\n2.2 Methods of analysis\nThere are different ways of calculating the stability of accident record over time. The\nsimplest and most common is to take two time periods and correlate the numbers in each for\nthe drivers. In the present paper, additional methods were needed to show, not just the size of\nthe correlation, but how the intercorrelations increased predictably when data was aggregated\nover periods, and how similar this increase was between groups of drivers defined by\ndifferent culpability levels, and also by different means. To achieve this goal, a series of\ncorrelations need to be calculated. With a long time period available, the best method would\nbe to start with each year in isolation and correlate it with all other years, thereafter\ncomputing the mean of the correlations, thus counteracting some of the randomness of\naccident rates. For the next step two-year periods would be used, and so on until only two\nperiods were left. However, in the present data, the time period was too short for such a\nstrategy (as the time period is doubled in every step). Therefore, aggregation was instead\nundertaken in smaller steps; first one year for each variable (accidents in 2001+2002\ncorrelated with 2003+2004), and then the only year left added (2001+2002 versus\n2003+2004+2005), yielding three different levels of aggregation (total time periods two, four\nand five years) in five samples, resulting in fifteen correlations and their accident means, for\nAll accidents and At fault accidents, respectively. In principle, however, any aggregation\nprinciple should have yielded the same result in the last analysis (association of correlations\nand means). The only critical issue is whether there is enough difference in the accident\nmeans for an association to become evident.\nThe expectation was that, as the number of correlations forming the mean decreased, and the\ntime period and mean number of accidents in each necessarily increased, so would the mean\ncorrelation between time periods. As the culpability category necessarily differs from All\n12\naccidents in mean number of incidents, it was therefore expected that each level would have\nits own unique regression line (see Statistical methods) when means and correlations were\ncorrelated, but also that this regression line would show a slightly stronger association for the\nculpable accidents at the same mean number of crashes.\n2.3 Statistical methods\nThe preferred statistical tool for the analysis was Pearson correlation. Although this method\nmay in some respects not be optimal for accident data, there was really no alternative, as it\nwas imperative that the present results could be compared to those of other studies on the\nstability of accident record, almost all of which have used Pearson correlations (e.g.\nH\u00e4kkinen, 1958; Peck, McBride & Coppin, 1971; Peck & Kuan, 1983; Gebers, 2003). Also,\nit has been found that using raw data of this type, or log transformation (which have been\nrecommended as a countermeasure against skewness), does not yield any differences (e.g.\nAvolio, Kroeck & Panek, 1985).\nAs ten different correlations were to be computed for the one-year periods, these needed to be\naveraged for each time period (or a differing number of associations would have resulted\nwhere only one was wanted). This was done by squaring each correlation into explained\nvariance, calculating the mean of these values and then taking the square root of this number.\nFinally, the average correlations computed can be plotted against the total mean number of\naccidents for both samples, in fact creating a correlation scatter plot. With this tool, it has\npreviously been found that the intercorrelations between time periods are largely determined\nby the mean (af W\u00e5hlberg, forthcoming), as shown in Figure 1.\n3. Results\n13\nFirst, accidents were correlated between single years for the two accident variables (All and\nculpable only) for all samples (see Table 2), and the means of these associations computed\n(first section of Table 3). Thereafter, accidents were aggregated in steps (years added into\nlonger periods) and correlated (sections two and three of Table 3). Second, the correlations of\neach aggregation level in all samples were correlated against the mean number of accidents\n(shown in Table 3) per total time period for each correlation, yielding an r of .91 (N=30,\np<.001).\nTables 2-3 about here\nAlso, separate correlations were run for At fault and All accidents correlations against the\nmeans of the variables, resulting in very similar values (.891 and .923, N=15 for each and\np<.001). Four fifths of the variation in correlation size was therefore explained by the mean\nnumber of accidents in the variables that were correlated. However, of more interest are the\nregression equations for these correlations, were the r of All accidents equal\n0.128+0.0716*accident mean, and At fault accidents equal 0.098+0.1090*accident mean.\nThis means that although All accidents initially (short time periods) have a higher stability,\nthe increase with higher accident means for At fault accidents is stronger, and at 0.82\naccidents, both will achieve r's of .187.\nThird, mean correlations for single years against single years (Table 2) were computed by\ntheir proximity in time to the other year, with results that are shown in Table 4. There was no\ntrend in the data, as the first and third values were almost exactly the same for both\nculpability categories, while the middle value differed somewhat, but in different directsions\nfor the categories.\n14\nFinally, experience was added as a factor in the analysis, by separating each sample into\nthose drivers with less than a year\u2019s experience in the beginning of 2001, and others. This\nuneven split of the samples was due to the fact that the effect of experience on accidents for\nthese drivers is only discernible in the first few years. Thereafter, there is no decline in\naccident rate (Dorn & af W\u00e5hlberg, in press). The accidents for the high\/low experience\ngroups were correlated for 2001 versus 2002 and 2001-2002 versus 2003-2005 for all\nsamples except number 3, as there were very few inexperienced drivers in that set. The\nresulting correlations were plotted against the accident means of the total time periods, with a\nresult that can be seen in Figure 2. It can be noted that despite the low numbers of drivers in\nthe inexperienced groups (N=31-77) and the resulting possibility for chance deviations, the\ncorrelations still largely conformed to a straight regression line, with half the variation in\ncorrelation size explained by the mean number of accidents in the period.\nTable 4 and Figure 2 about here\n4. Discussion\n4.1 Results\nThe results of the present analysis would seem to support the hypotheses stated in the\nintroduction. The size of the intercorrelation between accidents in different time periods does\nseem to increase fairly monotonically with the mean in the sample for both accident\nvariables. However, it is possible that this increase is not linear between accidents and the\ncorrelation, but rather the percentage of explained variance, where each numerical step\nindicates a similar difference in strength. Samples with much higher means are needed to test\nthis, as correlation size and percentage of explained variance do not differ much at the lower\nend of the scales.\n15\nThe difference in regression equations between culpable and All accidents could be an effect\nof exposure. In the present study, exposure was only handled by arranging data per year.\nHowever, the drivers will be driving for differing amounts of hours with each individual\nprobably tending to work a similar number of hours from one year to the next, i.e. hours\nworked correlate between years. Such a short-term stability of exposure would create an\ninitial stability of the accident record, especially the non-culpable crashes, but would not\nincrease as strongly with time, because hours of work would tend to shift somewhat\nrandomly, and eradicate the effect. This hypothesis is in principle testable in the present data,\nbut the results would be hard to interpret, for several reasons. First, the time frame needed for\nthe expected curvilinearity of the association to emerge would probably be at least twice as\nlong as the available series of accident data. Second, as the non-fault category in the present\ndata probably contains a proportion of accidents, which should not have been designated as\nsuch, the effect can be expected to be weak. Third, as exposure data was not available, it was\nnot possible to calculate how strong the stability of exposure effect could be expected to be.\nHowever, in a similar sample of drivers, it has been found that holding exposure constant had\na very slight negative effect on at fault accident correlations, but a positive, equally slight,\neffect on All accidents (af W\u00e5hlberg, submitted). This would seem to indicate that some of\nthe stability in accident record is indeed due to differential and stable exposure, but only for\nnon-culpable crashes. Therefore, if such an effect is at work in the present data, it can be\nexpected to be small.\nNo decrease in correlation strength was evident when time periods were not adjacent,\nalthough the periods used were the same length as those of Milosevic and Vucinic (1975),\nwho claimed to have found such an effect. However, although such a change could exist, it is\nprobably rather small, and thus not detectable in the present samples.\n16\nFrom the comparison of experienced to inexperienced drivers can be concluded that it is not\nmainly the difference in experience that has an impact upon the correlations between time\nperiods. It could otherwise be argued that some of the stability over time of accident record in\na group is simply due to differences in experience, with older drivers having consistently\nfewer accidents. It should be evident from the present results that if such an effect exists, it is\nmuch smaller than the accident proneness effect.\n4.2 Methodology and consequences\nOne important distinction between concepts needs to be made. In the present paper, the term\n'stability' has been used, while in many of the papers referenced it is instead the reliability of\naccident record that is discussed (but correlations reported). Now, stability refers to how\nsimilar the accident record is over time, but also hints at the supposed, and much greater,\nsimilarity over time of accident-causing behaviour, which lies behind the actual crashes.\nReliability, on the other hand, is more of a statistical\/methodological concept, which tells us\nhow much error we can expect in a certain situation (e.g. when using a population with a\ncertain mean number of accidents per year, for a specified period). Many researchers may\ntherefore be right in concluding that accidents are indeed very unreliable as a criterion (when\nthe mean is low). However, it would sometimes seem like not all have maintained the\ndistinction between the statistic, which they calculated for a certain period, and the wider\npicture of stability. Instead, they seem to have come to the conclusion that if accidents are\nunreliable here and now, they must be so for all time periods. It should be apparent from the\npresent results that this is not so. The results presented here seem to indicate that the\nintercorrelations increase linearly with the mean number of accidents in the population. This,\nhowever, is of course not possible in the long run, as it implies that the association would be\nperfect after n years (in the presently used population 14 years for All accidents). It is instead\n17\nexpected that the association is somewhat curvilinear. However, there is currently a lack of\npublished data in the range of 15-20 accidents (i.e. samples with such means), lying between\nthe results quoted here and those of H\u00e4kkinen (1979) and Blasco, Prieto and Cornejo (2003),\nwhose high-risk, longitudinal samples do not fit into the general picture (Figure 1), unless\ncurvilinearity is assumed.\nIt might be added that Peck (1993) presented calculations on the maximum attainable\ncorrelation between accidents and a \u2018perfect predictor\u2019, given the variance of the former. In\nessence, what Peck was saying was the same thing as what has been pointed out here; if\nvariance is low, correlations will be small, no matter how good the predictor, i.e. the actual\nassociation between the variables.\nOne of the conclusions drawn from some of the low-correlation-between-time-periods studies\nreferenced in the introduction was that it would be fairly useless to exclude the high-accident\ndrivers from driving, because they were few, and most of them did not repeat their high\nnumber of crashes again in the next time period. However, the present results indicate that\nthese results and thinking were faulty, and simply artefacts of the short time periods and low-\nrisk populations utilized. If longer periods had been used, the effect of removing drivers\nwould have been larger. After the many decades of criticism of the accident proneness theory,\nwe tentatively suggest that the statistical arguments that caused it to fall into disrepute may\nwell have been rather prematurely based. The positive results of the policy to exclude high-\naccident involved drivers from driving within a transportation company for an eight-year\nperiod was reported by Rawson (1944) but does otherwise not seem to have been evaluated\nor reported as being a policy advocated by transportation companies currently, perhaps\nbecause of the consensus has been that such a policy would be futile given the early\narguments surrounding the notion of accident proneness. Further research is required to\nreplicate the findings of the analyses here, and if confirmed has practical implications for\n18\norganizations with major fleets. Driving for work increases the risk of being involved in a\ncrash by about 50% (Broughton et al, 2003) and training interventions targeting accident\ninvolved drivers who are likely to go on to have more crashes may have a significant impact\non work-related road safety.\nIt might be noted here that there does not seem to be any effect of low means such that the\ncorrelation coefficients become smaller than expected at the low end, as could possibly be\nexpected due to the increasing violation of the assumption of normality of the distribution.\nInstead, these values conform to a linear function. This shows that the Pearson correlation is\nextremely robust, and useful, even when the normal distribution assumption is violated (as\nwhen means are very low).\nIt has been suggested that the term accident proneness should be replaced by accident\nliability, i.e. the risk of having an accident, not necessarily by causing it. However, this\nbroader term and thinking would seem to be even less theoretical than the accident proneness\nconcept, and although it does stress the importance of the environment and exposure, few if\nany predictions would seem to follow. Accident proneness, on the other hand, predicts such\npractically important effects as the association between different types of accidents. It is\ntherefore suggested that accident proneness should be revived into traffic research, and\nattempts made to develop it further. It is not the theory that is deficient, but the previous\ninterpretations of the results.\nAcknowledgements\nThe accident data was kindly provided by a major British bus company.
