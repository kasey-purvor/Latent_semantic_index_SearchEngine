For both catchments, EUROSEM was used to simulate interrill erosion from single storm events on plots of 10 m by 2 m. The model was calibrated and validated for a barley crop at Embori and three treatments of bare, grass and shrub covers at Mukogodo. The results indicated that EUROSEM was applicable to the Embori catchment, as correlation coefficients of 0\u00b791 and 0\u00b784 were obtained between observed and simulated runoff and soil loss, respectively. However, for Mukogodo, the model did not adequately predict soil loss from vegetated plots having grass or shrubs, although it could predict runoff from bare plots and grass quite well (R2 = 0\u00b797, R2 = 0\u00b760, respectively) as well as soil loss from bare plots (R2 = 0\u00b758), but the standard errors of estimate at 4\u00b767 mm were rather high (P = 0\u00b795). Thus, EUROSEM requires improvements in terms of being able to predict runoff and soil loss in semi-arid regions of Kenya, so that it can accommodate multiple vegetation covers, rangeland conditions and soils with surface sealing properties.
