Western societies typically characterise the \nideal human as independent and self-reliant. The resultant welfare systems provide \ntemporary havens away from the everyday, competitive spaces of capitalist \nsocieties, termed here the enclave model. Social scientists problematise this model \non several grounds: the construction of pathologised and medicalised body forms; \nthe neglect of caring practices that are gendered, invisible and primarily private; the \nde-politicisation of caring practices. Policy calls reject reference to care and its \nassociations with dependency, make visible and value informal care work or  invoke \na caring citizenship as a policy goal not just a means.  \n \nInto this field of contested notions of care enters a well-documented rise in access \nto, and consultation through, the internet in everyday lives for a vast range of issues. \nHealth care encountered on-line reflects a similar range in form as that encountered \noff-line and much that is innovative, whilst clearly of benefit, does nothing to \nchallenge the existing dominance of the enclave model of social care. However, \ncertain groups of sites create spaces through which participants can both express \nand extract caring relationships that are otherwise unforthcoming. The paper argues \nthat these sites afford potential to develop an alternative model of caring, to reframe \nquestions of how to care about distant others and to demonstrate the centrality of \ncaring relations to human life.   \nThe Potential of the Internet for Alternative Caring Practices for Health \n \nThe term \u201ecare\u201f is widely used in everyday parlance across many spheres and \nspaces of action. Several interrelating strands of research have endeavoured to \nunpick the meanings and assumptions that inhere to the concept of care and its \npractice in different spaces. This paper explores whether the relatively new spaces \nof the internet can enable practices of care that represent alternatives to the \nconventional structuring of caring relations within contemporary, liberal democracies \nof Western society.  \n \nProblematising Care \nThe distinction, teased out by Noddings (1984), between caring for and caring about \nunderpins debates of how society might facilitate and express caring relationships. \nCaring for denotes proximity whereas caring about denotes distance. Social policies \nreflect the extent that care is positioned as an individual responsibility, caring for, or \na societal responsibility, caring about, and as such, structure how a society enables \nits citizens to care about others. Societal responsibilities are structured through \nsystems to provide health and social care. These formally constituted systems of \ncare acknowledge collective responsibility where the market fails to meet basic \nneeds. As such, caring practices are enacted in specific sites that are set apart from \nthe everyday spaces of a competitive capitalist system for those unable to function \ntherein. This approach, referred to in this paper as the enclave model of care, is \npremised on a vision of the desirable person as independent and self-reliant; \nprovision of care aims to facilitate functioning in this manner. The increased \ndominance of neoliberal principles in politics over the last thirty years has further \ndeepened an enclave model of  social policy of care for exceptional cases, with \neveryday care the responsibility of each individual or those emotionally related to \nthem (S. Smith 2005; McLaughlin 2006; Sevenhuijsen 2003; Lawson 2007).  \n \nThis characterisation of care has provoked three major critiques. First, the disability \nmovement has politicised and rejected the language of care in policy practice \narguing that use of the term invokes negative associations through the implicit \nconstruction of a normalised body that pathologises other forms, the explicit \ninscription of disability as dependency and the framing of assistance as individual, \nmedicalising and marginalizing rather than social, environmental and enabling \n(McLaughlin 2006).  Secondly, social scientists have repeatedly demonstrated the \nreliance of the enclave model on everyday caring practices that are highly gendered, \nlargely invisible and primarily situated in, and constitutive, of the home, \ncharacteristics that further marginalise the place of caring practice in society. The \nsocial expectation of performing care contributes to the reproduction of gender \ninequalities, trapping women into invisible, undervalued and disempowering \nactivities. Feminists have called for the private sphere of informal caring to be visible \nand valued equally alongside the public domains of economic activity (McKie, \nGregory and Bowlby 2002; McKie, Bowlby and Gregory 2004). Finally, this critique is \ntaken further in an argument that the enclave model of social policy does not merely \nignore and undervalue the extent of everyday caring practices, but exists exactly \nbecause of this exclusion (Young 2000). Caring practices are re-characterised as not \njust worthy of celebration but central to society and, as such, essentially political \n(Brown 2003). In this re-characterisation, the desirable social subject as independent \nis rejected in favour of valuing mutual interdependence. The argument to make \ncentral the subjective, emotional and irrational qualities that contribute to caring \npractices currently marginalised within the private, feminine and non-political \nspheres resonates with arguments elsewhere to bring emotion to the fore within a \npolicy-relevant social science (Anderson and S. Smith 2001). An ethic of care built \ninto the goals of public institutions and policies and constructions of the market \nwould define equal access to care as the primary right and measure of a successful \nsociety (S. Smith 2005; Lawson 2007; Sevenhuijsen 2003). This posits a vision of \npublic policy in which a caring citizenship is an end rather than a means.  \n \nThe differential value given to rational, universally relevant practices and subjective, \ncontextual, interpersonal practices is given explicit expression and tension within the \nsingle sphere of health care. A distinction has been made between care-as-curing, \nthe provision of technical, clinical skills applicable in any setting, and care-as-caring, \nthe provision of context- and person-specific emotional and psychological support \n(Bauman et al. 2002; Gordon 2003; Howell 2001; Mintzberg 2002). Care-as-curing \nechoes the enclave model which treats the patient as temporarily dependent due to \na condition that can be managed through the application of scientific knowledge, \ntraditionally determined by the male physician, within a rationalised system for health \ncare provision. Care-as-caring echoes the invisible and informal care work carried \nout in private spaces on which the enclave model depends and is traditionally part of \nthe routine work of the female nurse. Care-as-caring continues to be relatively \ninvisible within the enclave of the health system, \u201e..the total activities of care contain \nelements of curing and caring; but almost all existing procedures for appraising \n\u201cquality of care\u201d today are aimed only at curing\u201f (Feinstein 2001, 201). The lower \nvalue accorded to care-as-caring is evident when nurses insist that their primary \nfunction is curing not caring (Melia 1987). At the same time, evidence that care-as-\ncaring can be central to a therapeutic process and the prominence in disease \nprofiles of complex, chronic diseases that are not amenable to simple care-as-\ncuring, blur the distinction between the two practices and demands new modes of \nconceptualisation (Mol 2008). \n \nThe sphere of health care is thus complex in that the dual nature of health care as \ncuring and caring involves technical and emotional inputs implicitly defining care as \nboth material and relational, a complexity only deepened by arguments for blurring \nthat distinction.  This notwithstanding, use of the term care is infused with an \nemotional engagement whether in the immediate relations of caring for others or the \nmore distant relations of caring about others. And yet, mainstream approaches to \npolicy-making and system development for health care exclude explicit consideration \nof these aspects.  \n \nHealth Care and The Internet \nInto this field of contested notions of care enters a well-documented rise in access to \nand use of the internet in everyday lives for a vast range of health-related issues. \nEstimates of the population who had ever gone on-line have risen rapidly over the \nlast decade in the US and the UK (Pew Internet 2007; ONS 2008). In the US, 80% of \nadults with internet access (estimated at over 70% by Pew Internet, 2007) use it, \ninter alia, for health care (Fox 2006). In the UK, 27% of all adults who had accessed \nthe internet in the three months prior to the survey had searched for health-related \ninformation. More people go on line for medical advice in any day than visit health \nprofessionals (Fox and Rainie 2002). While the majority of health seeking has \nalways taken place outside the formal spaces of health facilities, this does suggest a \nshift in the ways and places in which everyday health seeking practices are enacted.  \n \nThe main health-related activities on the internet involve seeking direct advice on \nclinical management, information searching, support networking and accessing \nglobal health markets through e-commerce (Eysenbach 2003; Hardey 1999; Purcell, \nWilson and Delamothe 2002). Most activity is contained within private homes (ONS \n2007) and there is concern that the internet deepens existing social and spatial \ndivisions such that those who might most benefit from e-health are least able to \naccess the technology (Blackburn, Read and Hughes 2005; Colle 2000; Forkner-\nDunn 2003). Access is not just defined by a connected computer but also by \ncomputer literacy, convenience, lack of fear, available time and social filters \nfacilitating use (Colle,2000; Eysenbach 2003; Wyatt et al. 2005). \n \nHow, then, do the spaces for health care on the internet intersect with the debates \naround the nature and practice of care ? In particular, do internet sites merely re-\nenact or complement existing practices of health care, albeit through a new medium, \nor is there any sense in which health care sites may represent an alternative space \nfor caring ?  \n \nApproaches and Sources \nThe paper addresses these questions under two headings that reflect the main \ntheme of the paper: complementary and alternative spaces of health care. These \n\u201espaces\u201f examine three of the main health care activities on the internet identified \nabove: clinical management; information searching; support networking. A further \ntype of health care activity, self-diagnosis, is distinguished from information \nsearching and support networking given the importance of this to health care. \nHealth-related e-commerce is not examined, being beyond the scope of the paper. \n \nThe discussion derives from two sources of information: published literature and \nuser testimonials. Examination of the four types of health care on-line through a lens \nof care has involved a series of selections from what is already a vast literature. \nFirst, health care on-line can clearly produce harm. Whilst not underestimating such \nrisks, this paper purposively focuses on examples that are beneficial in order to \naddress the potential for alternative caring practices. Secondly, particular health \nissues have been selected for focus. Clinical management on-line, argued to \nempower through disease control, is explored through diabetes management \nbecause internet use is relatively well established. Information searching, argued to \nempower through knowledge, is illustrated through a focus on gender. Literature \nsearches were made through major databases \u2013 web of knowledge, medline, \ngeobase, google scholar. There is relatively little written about the implications of \nusing the internet for self-diagnosis and for support networking. These uses of the \ninternet find particular relevance for less common conditions of which we selected \none, Lyme Disease. The paper draws on formal testimonials posted in publicly \naccessible spaces on-line (EuroLyme and Lyme disease action,  \nwww.lymediseaseaction.org.uk, and the Lyme League of America \nwww.lymeleague.com) or, in one case, e-mailed to the authors with permission to \npublish. These are not taken from informal or private members\u201f forums and are not \nposted to initiate exchange and discussion. As such, the data are not obtained \nthrough \u201elurking\u201f or other covert quasi-participatory techniques that provoke debate \nabout the ethics of on-line research (Madge, 2007).  \n \nI. A Complementary Space for Health Care ? Clinical Management and Information \nSearching \n \nManagement of diabetes types 1 and 2 combines diet and exercise with varying \nlevels of medication, particularly of insulin. The management model is for self-care, \nan explicit policy for patients to \u201ebecome experts in the management of their own \ndiabetes\u201f (Pooley et al. 2001, 319). This model is implemented conventionally \nthrough routine GP check-ups and specialist referral (Mazzi and Kidd 2002). \nOperational problems include poor compliance related to discrepant perceptions of \nneeds between patients and practitioners, the lack of reciprocity in the relationship, \nthe perception of negative judgement by the clinician and time constraints in clinical \npractice to optimise care and self-management plans (Glasgow et al. 2003).  \n \nThese problems from interpersonal encounters in practitioner-led self-management \nindicate the potential for an on-line alternative (Grant et al. 2004). Early experiences \nsuggest on-line professional intervention may lower the frequency of hospitalisation \nand costs of treatment (Mazzi and Kidd 2002). Evaluations of peer on-line advice for \nclinical management were positive (MacPherson, Joseph and Sullivan 2004; Zrebiec \n2005) with no evidence that users made exclusive use of this source of advice as an \nalternative to the professional consultation (Kelly et al. 2002). Indeed, \u201emost of the \ndisagreements in the diabetic group were concerned with arguments over the \naccuracy of the information\u201f and that, \u201eRather than a rejection of evidence-based \nclinical advice, it offers a secure space where such information can be assimilated \nand reflexively shaped to inform lifestyle choices \u2013 a space where discursive \nlearning about one\u201fs condition can be undertaken on a more equal basis\u201f (Loader et \nal. 2002, 63 and 64). \n \nWeb-site developments now enable integrated support whereby the disease can be \nmeasured, monitored and managed with tailored care (Mazzi and Kidd 2002). A \nperson with diabetes can read and upload blood glucose measurements across the \nday to generate tailored advice and help normalise the diabetes into their daily \nlifestyles. This procedure also addresses important behavioural risks such as \nactivity, diet or smoking, which are dealt with unsystematically in consultations \n(McKay et al. 2001). The few evaluative studies so far are promising in terms of \nclinical impacts (McMahon et al. 2005). The use of online dietary coaches has \nshown significant improvements in dietary behaviour and exercise in the short-term, \nalthough this effect may decline with time (Mazzi and Kidd 2002; Glasgow et al. \n2003; McKay et al. 2001). The main problem with on-line clinical care is that people \nwith diabetes come disproportionately from age and class categories that have the \nleast internet access (Brodie et al. 2000; Forkner-Dunn 2003; Grant et al. 2004; \nMazzi and Kidd 2002).  \n \nThe spaces of the internet therefore can facilitate provision of technical and clinical \ncare. The care draws on scientific, rational knowledge which, although generating \ntailored management plans, is of universal applicability.  This, then, is a variant for \nchronic conditions of care-as-curing in which, in the absence of cure, care is of \nmanagement and containment. Moreover, this is care-as-curing to explicitly enable \nindependence through performance of the normal body. As such, there are aspects \nto monitoring the body which are clearly ambivalent, overlapping with critical \ndiscussions of body tyranny, body surveillance and body discipline, particularly in \nrelation to body size, diet and exercise (Schuurman 2004). Despite the undoubted \nbenefits of such on-line practices in making it easier for people with long-term \nconditions to function in the world the way it is, it does not fundamentally challenge \nour social values or political processes; it does not represent a radical or alternative \ndevelopment in caring practices for health. \n \nSearching for health-related information is probably the most common use of the \ninternet for health care and various writers have explored the implications (Baker et \nal. 2006; Broom 2005a, 2005b; Hardey 1999; Hirji 2004; Pandey, Hart and Tiwary \n2003; Radin 2006). It is argued that access directly to information, unmediated by a \nhealth professional, has the potential to challenge power relations and democratise \ncaring practices. The in-depth studies of Crooks (2006) and Broom (2005a, 2005b) \ndemonstrate how women and men respectively use information from the internet \nboth to feel in control of their disease and to feel empowered in face-to-face \nconsultations with health professionals. Such studies indicate the potential of the \ninternet to alter caring practices more widely since these have been so highly \ngendered. The implications are complex. At an individual scale, Kitchin (1998) \nargued that the docile bodies of women remain docile on-line. Crooks\u201f (2006) \nexamples of how women with fibromyalgia draw on the internet to empower \nthemselves in consultations suggest otherwise. But health and education, traditional \nfemale domains, comprise the only on-line categories where women are more active \nthan men (ONS 2007), It seems that at a social scale the gendered nature of caring \npractice overcomes the gendered nature of internet use. \n \nThe internet may provide a space where men can take a more active role in caring \nactivities for themselves and for others (Broom, 2005a, 2005b). Social scientists \nhave long criticised the biomedical model for its depersonalising practices in which \nthe practitioner sees symptoms and organs rather than the whole person (for \nexample Martin, 1987). But it is exactly the depersonalised nature of internet spaces, \nthe physical distance from others that facilitates men overcoming traditional \nmasculine roles and values to seek care and to disclose personal experiences of \npain and emotion (Broom, 2005a, 2005b). The depersonalised interface of the \ninternet may provide a strangely caring space in that it is experienced as non-\njudgemental.  \n There is, then, evidence that information searching and the impersonal nature of the \nspaces of care on-line, may impact on patient-professional and gendered \nrelationships of care. However, this does not necessarily signify the radical \nrestructuring of power relations implied. Informed and empowered patients \ncorrespond with contemporary, neoliberal discourse in which the user of health care \nis reconfigured as the client or customer, health services as commodities and care \nas an economic transaction. Any relocation of care from women to men in this \ncontext may only reflect greater market content to care in which men are traditionally \nmore active. And alongside any potential for empowerment, the internet may also \nbring additional demands on women. Now not only does the caring role involve \nphysical and emotional inputs but also time for information searching, sifting and \nsynthesis. Although on-line information searching may impact on power relations in \nthe micro-politics of interpersonal relations, this does not ultimately challenge the \nenclave model of health care in society but rather complements changes wrought \nthrough contemporary neoliberal policies including deepening individual \nresponsibilities for care with the associated demands on women. \n \nII. An Alternative Space For Health Care ? Self-Diagnosis and Support Networks \n \nInformation searching on-line does offer potential for an alternative caring practice \nwhen it involves cases where conventional professional health care fails to deliver on \nwhat, arguably, is the very area in which the claim for professional expertise most \nresides, that of the diagnosis. \n \nLyme disease is one of very many relatively uncommon but potentially debilitating \nconditions for which the practices of health care on-line may be particularly suitable. \nIt is a tick-borne chronic illness with far-reaching effects on almost all aspects of the \nbody\u201fs functioning with time,  \n\u201eI was bitten by a tick in the local woods in 2004. I was playing hide-and-seek \nwith my niece and nephew at the time. I had all the typical symptoms \n(sickness, shivery chills, bulls-eye rash) but my GP didn\u201ft have a clue about it \n\u2013 and still doesn\u201ft. By the time I eventually diagnosed myself and demanded \nto see a specialist, I had excruciating headaches and eye pain, hip pain, \nringing in the ears, blue hands, breathlessness, numb foot, disrupted \ndigestion, depression, high blood pressure, restless legs, unexplained weight \nloss, extreme fatigue, rib pain, mouth ulcers, heart palpitations and racing \nheart\u201f \n(emailed testimonial, diagnosed early 2007) \n \nTestimonials published and posted by sufferers of Lyme disease on internet sites \nfrom both UK and US share a series of common experiences: \n being told the health professionals cannot find anything wrong \n in the absence of anything else, being given a psycho-somatic diagnosis such \nas depression or stress and questioned about their domestic life \n being ridiculed, treated as a malingerer or as imagining an illness \u2013 one \nsufferer was asked in hospital, \u201ehave you got any more symptoms today?\u201f \n having their self-diagnosis, other person\u201fs diagnosis and even another \nphysician\u201fs diagnosis ignored \n not being given more advanced tests when the basic test returned negative \n receiving inadequate treatment that did not follow up-to-date protocols \n experiencing serious delays in treatment so that the condition of the disease \nwas vastly worse when finally diagnosed \n more positively, gaining treatment even though the diagnosis was not \nconfirmed \n \nThe testimonials emphasise the power of medical practice as the gatekeeper of \naccess to treatment. Professional ignorance of uncommon conditions is \nunderstandable; indeed physicians themselves increasingly turn to the internet under \nsuch circumstances (Greenwald 2005; Tang and Ng 2006). What is striking is the \nlack of a caring about the patient, ridiculing them, making them feel in the way or \nreducing the patient to an object for study. The experience of a physician who \nhimself contracted Lyme and went undiagnosed is instructive,  \n\u201eIn the end it was easier to live with the symptoms rather than be ridiculed by \nthose from whom I might seek advice\u2026..\u201f    (Wilson 1999, 649). \n \nAnother testimonial highlights the emotional vulnerability of the undiagnosed case,  \n\u201e.. it was full of students waiting to see the great doctor at work and learn all \nthey could from the master. After he inspected me and let all the students \ninspect me he gave his diagnosis\u2026.. I went from feeling fairly good to feeling \ndepressed within seconds.\u201f \n http:\/\/www.lymediseaseaction.org.uk  links, patient stories. Accessed 21st \nMay, 2009 \n \nThese examples of professional ignorance, inability to diagnose or treat and the lack \nof caring practice question whether an ill-informed use of internet spaces will always \nrisk greater harm to health than expert consultation. The role of the internet in these \ncases is not just to empower patients to become their own health care managers but \nto empower patients to demand and extract caring practice in circumstances where it \nis otherwise unforthcoming. This may involve challenging existing power relations \nand in particular those power relations based on the authority of expertise. This can \npose many challenges,  \n\u201eWe live in our bodies, we know what is happening to our lives. We need to \neducate these doctors to LISTEN to their patients. Do not be afraid to mail \ninformation to these so-called educated physicians when they deny lyme \nexists or refuse to treat you\u2026 And most importantly\u2026 don\u201ft give up. YOU \nARE NOT CRAZY. Yes you have Lyme, but you also have lots of support. \nVisit the lyme sites on this website and as many as you can find on the \ninternet. Get a lyme-literate doctor, get educated about your illness and most \nimportantly, GET BETTER\u201f  [emphases in the original] \nwww.sewill.org\/story1.htm (accessed 2nd June, 2009) \n \n\u201eWe are still struggling to get treatment after 14 years while Doctors in our state \nclaim Lyme disease is \"not in our area\", that chronic Lyme \"doesn't exist\" or that they \nwon't treat longer than 30 days because of the medical boards and insurance \nproblems. This is unacceptable!\u201f \nwww.lymeleague\/com  (patient stories, Wisconsin, accessed 21st May, 2009) \n \nThese testimonials and other studies of information searching are based on sites \nthat also provide support networking through user and disease-specific on-line \ngroups,  \n\u201eIt\u201fs been a long haul but I\u201fm making good progress. The Eurolyme support \ngroup has been a great way of judging how well I\u201fm doing. If it hadn\u201ft been for \nthat I\u201fm sure I would be very despondent by now at the length of time it has \ntaken. However, others are very encouraging when it\u201fs needed and it\u201fs such a \nrelief to converse with others who know how awful it is\u201f  \n (emailed testimonial) \n \nThere has been no research on the roles in society of those who not only go on-line \nand support one another, which might be seen as reciprocal and therefore explained \nthrough individual interest, but who voluntarily set up such sites. Testimonials on \nsupport sites demonstrate the effort involved,  \n\u201eHaving found I was suffering from Lyme disease in 1997 I spent several \nhours trawling the web for as much information as I could find on the disease. \nAt the time there was little UK specific data. I thought it might be useful to put \na site together that linked all the most useful information that I had found. I \nalso provided a pack of information to help give a more detailed view for the \nmedical profession and anyone interested.\u201f  \nhttp:\/\/www.lymediseaseaction.org.uk   links - patient stories, accessed 21st \nMay, 2009 \n \nSufferers post their own story on-line for others, strangers, to read. The intentions \nare two-fold: enabling individuals to get help and redressing systemic inadequacies \nin formal care practices, \n\u201eI hope you can do something with this: it\u201fs not everything but it\u201fs a start. If we \nhelp one person then some good will come of all this. I have been asked what \nI want from all this ? Well I want my country to love me as I love it. I want the \nNHS to give people the help they have paid for over the years. I want my \nfamily to grow up loving life and not fearing it\u201f \nhttp:\/\/www.lymediseaseaction.org.uk  links - patient stories, accessed 21st May, 2009 \n \nSuch support work may be interpreted as fulfilling individual interests in that through \nsuch action, people make sense of lives that have been otherwise blighted by ill-\nhealth and thus reclaim value, meaning and purpose to their lives. Whilst this may be \nso, what is interesting is that this reclaiming is not, or not only, through a return to \nthe work-force and the everyday spaces of capitalist society, but through caring \nabout others, distant strangers, who may face the same experiences in the future.  \nThe previous quotation by a British male uses the word \u201elove\u201f three times, not an \neveryday practice in public spaces amongst strangers in the UK. It is this ability of \nthe internet to bring distant others into the same space to form more intimate \ninteractions that represents its potential to challenge and rework the practices of how \nsociety cares about others. In particular, these sites of health represent spaces that \nare constructed on non-market, non-individualistic principles and as such are \nmutually constituted and constitutive of caring relationships enacted in part at a \ndistance but also in part on a one-on-one basis.  \n \nLast Reflections \nThe internet inevitably reflects and reproduces relations, values and processes of \nwider society. Cautionary tales relate to the potential of the internet to exacerbate \nexisting inequalities through the digital divide or to fulfil the fantasy of the global \nmarket-place where you can buy anything regardless of whether you should. \nSimilarly, celebrations of the internet in health care concern its enhancement of \nstrategies for people to maintain socially acceptable identities and functions, its \nsupport of the neoliberal construction of health user as customer and personal health \nmanager through ease of access to information and empowered engagement with \nhealth professionals. As such, the internet affords spaces of health care that \ncomplement existing off-line options. But part of what is valued about on-line care-\nas-caring is an impersonal quality, complicating accepted critiques of clinical training \nin \u201edetached concern\u201f (Fox 2006; Halpern 2001) and offering new spaces in which to \nexplore human subjectivities in health-related encounters.  \n \nFurther renegotiations of the practices of care are evident through sites that support \nuncommon conditions such as Lyme disease. This space does several things. The \nindividual empowerment of self-diagnosis goes beyond that depicted by those using \ninformation to enter a more equal dialogue with professionals. The sufferers of Lyme \nare extracting various forms of care from a formal system from which the necessary \ncare is not forthcoming. The further investment that some individuals or groups are \nprepared to make into creating and maintaining support sites brings to the fore the \nimportance of caring relationships in giving meaning to human lives. Self-help \nsupport sites on the internet can be interpreted as a bid to secure a more caring \ncitizenship in what at times seems a care-less landscape. Whilst self-help and \nsupport groups existed long before the internet, the potential ease of access from \nany place at any time makes this a particularly important emerging form of caring \npractice. \n \nThese potentially alternative spaces of health care on the internet contribute in \nreframing to some extent a question of how to express caring about distant others \n(Silk 2004; D. Smith 1998). The internet spaces of health care argued here to offer \nan alternative practice of care do so by tackling the question of how to express \ncaring about distant others in two ways. First and most obviously, the internet \ncreates spaces which brings distant others together into a virtual proximity, \neffectively eroding some aspects of distance. It cannot erode the real physical \ndistance or enable the intimacy of touch, a distinctive aspect of caring. But as \nalready indicated, this new capacity for virtual proximity without physical intimacy \nhas its own benefits in caring practices. Secondly, in a capitalist system, emotions \nand moralities of care about others have to find translation through a financial \nmedium. The internet spaces explored here have the capacity to enable a caring \npractice that transcends the need for financial mediation. The opportunities to \nexpand this kind of internet social engagement that may be afforded through the \nnext generation of technology, most immediately web 2.0, beg for in-depth on-line \nethnographies to further explore the nature of caring practices on-line. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n REFERENCES \nAnderson, K., and S.
