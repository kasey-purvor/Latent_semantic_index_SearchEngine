The optimum detector, according to our predictions, has a\nsensor whose compliance is large compared to that of the fluid enclosed by the cell. A simple\nphotoacoustic cell has been built, incorporating a thin-walled piezoelectric cylinder. It was used to test\nthe theory, and demonstrate photoacoustic detection of an absorber in aqueous solution, excited by a\nlow power 678nm laser diode modulated at 110Hz. We have detected absorbances as low as\napproximately 3\uf0b410-3 cm-1 (SNR=1), corresponding to the absorption of light with a modulated power\nof 50\uf06dW rms.\nPACS numbers: 07.07.Df, 78.20.Hp, 78.30.Cp\n1 Introduction\nThere has been much interest in photoacoustic (PA) detection as a sensitive means of\ndetermining optical absorption[1,2]. Light energy absorbed by an analyte is converted to heat, which\ncauses the analyte and surrounding matrix (gas, liquid or solid) to expand. This expansion may be\ndetected as a transient pressure wave emanating from the source(s) of the absorption, or as a lower\nfrequency increase in the pressure within an enclosed system. The method is considered to have a\nnumber of advantages. PA signals are first order measurements of absorption, in that the detected\nsignal in both cases is directly proportional to the light power absorbed, I0-I, rather than to that\ntransmitted, I. Compared with measurements of the transmitted light I, the effects of source flicker\nnoise and shot noise are therefore reduced and the dynamic range of the technique can be large.\nAdditionally, light scattering in the sample has less effect on photoacoustic signals than on\nconventional measurements, the latter employing effectively smaller acceptance apertures for the\ntransmitted light.\n2Much of the recent work on the photoacoustic detection of compounds in liquid solutions has\nconcentrated on the use of pulsed light sources[3]. Use of a pulsed source and high speed detection\nallows measurement of transient photoacoustic waves in open sample containers. The peak incident\nlight power is increased, but this benefit cannot be fully realised in open cells because only a\nproportion of the transient acoustic wave can be captured by the detector. The approach rules out\nmany cw light sources that are rugged, reliable and inexpensive, therefore better suited to process\nenvironments.\nFor the analysis of liquid samples, many photoacoustic systems have been designed that employ\npiezoelectric transducers made of the ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as acoustic detectors[1]. For\npulsed operation, the simplest configuration is often a slab of the material, acoustically coupled to the\nbottom of a cuvette[4], or contained next to a polished stainless steel probe (which reflects stray\nlight)[3]. For low-frequency modulated cw operation, a closed cell is required to maximise the detected\npressure increase and the PZT may form a substantial part of the cell itself. These closed cells\ntherefore make maximal use of the incident light power, an important consideration for low power\nlight sources. Various schemes have been proposed for resonant and non-resonant operation of closed\ncells[2]. The optimum shape for a closed photoacoustic detector is considered to be a compromise\nbetween low volume and large optical path length, and therefore should be matched to the shape of the\nincident light beam[5]; cylindrically shaped transducers typically being used with collimated light\nsources.\nInterest in optimising the design of photoacoustic cells comes from two standpoints. Firstly, the signal\nis proportional to the incident light power and therefore for low power light sources, it is especially\nnecessary to optimise a system\u2019s responsivity in order to detect low levels of light absorption.\nSecondly, recent work on miniaturising the technology fosters interest in design and scaling rules that\nhelp drive the development[6]. There is, however, little in the way of quantitative prediction of signal\nlevels in closed systems. A quantitative analysis of system performance has recently been successful\nin describing the performance of closed low frequency (sub resonant) gas cells[6]. In such conditions,\nthe bulk compliance of the gaseous analyte dominates over that of other elements such as the sensor\nand the cell itself. For closed fluid cells where the analyte compliance is much lower, the mechanical\ncompliance of the acoustic sensor and of the cell itself must also be considered.\nWe present a quantitative analysis, considering the effect of all the significant dc compliances of the\ncell, including those of the enclosed fluid and of the sensing element. This is valid provided that the\nmodulation frequencies used are much lower than the frequencies of any mechanical resonances in the\nsystem. The optimum design is predicted to use a transducer whose mechanical compliance is large\ncompared to that of the enclosed water. The general approach has previously been validated for an\nalternative photoacoustic \/ photothermal sensor, based on the use of a water meniscus as a sensor with\na high and predictable compliance[7], but to our knowledge the compliance analysis has not been\npreviously applied to PZT detectors.\nThis paper addresses the operation of a photoacoustic cell based on a thin-walled cylindrical\npiezoelectric transducer with a high compliance. The response of the device to pressure increases in\nthe cell has been tested, and the system was used to detect trace concentrations of an absorbing\ncompound (potassium permanganate, KMnO4) in aqueous solution.\n2 Theory of operation of a simple photoacoustic cell\nConsider a closed cylindrical cell, inside which we assume that the pressure instantaneously reaches a\nsteady-state value whenever a photon is absorbed. This approach is valid provided that we operate at\nlow (sub-resonant) modulation frequencies, for which acoustic wavelengths are much larger than our\ncell dimensions, the modulation is on a timescale which is shorter than any thermal relaxation in the\ncell, and the absorber delivers heat energy to the fluid on a timescale shorter than the modulation\nperiod.\n3Consider a cylindrical cell, with the coordinate system shown in Figure 1. We know that when the\ncylindrical region of fluid lying in the optical path absorbs a small amount of light energy \uf064E, its\nunconstrained volume increase is;\n\uf072\n\uf064\uf062\n\uf064\nC\nEV\np\n\uf03d (1)\nwhere \uf062 is the volume thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid, Cp is its specific heat capacity and \uf072\nis its density. Note that, under these conditions, the expression does not involve the original volume of\nthe absorbing region, and we need not make any assumptions about its size, shape or position. Because\nthe temperature increase of the water and the windows will typically be tiny, we can assume that their\nbulk properties remain unchanged throughout each experiment.\nFigure 1. Exploded diagram of a simple photoacoustic cell, showing cylindrical coordinate system.\nWe wish to calculate the pressure increase in a closed cell due to this energy absorption, by finding the\ncompliance (\uf0b6V\/\uf0b6P) of the cell. Firstly, we consider the volume change of different elements in the\ncell, for a given applied pressure, then find the sum of these quantities. When the pressure inside the\ncell increases, the water can compress, the piezo can stretch, and the windows can bend. We assume\nthat there are no other significant compliance effects in the cell. Having determined the total\ncompliance, the resulting strain on the piezo can be calculated, and so can the expected magnitude of\nour signal.\n2.1 Compliance of the PZT\nWe can consider the volume expansion of the cylindrical PZT by assuming that it expands by\nincreasing its length and girth rather than by bending. We also assume that the stresses on the piezo in\nthe 1- and 2- directions are separable because there is a net material symmetry between these\ndirections. A net anisotropy exists only in the PZT poling direction, which in this case is the 3-\ndirection and is orthogonal to the 1- and 2-directions. Therefore we can consider the stresses in the 1-\nand 2- directions independently, and superimpose their effects.\nFirstly consider the effect of an increase in radius. An increase in pressure \u03b4P causes a circumferential\nstress in the walls which must be balanced. The tension in the walls is:\npppp Lt=LrP=F 22 \uf073\uf064 (2)\nwhere rp is the mean (neutral axis) radius of the cylindrical piezo shell, Lp is its length, tp is its\nthickness and \u03c32 is the PZT stress in the 2-direction. For the cylinder to increase its enclosed volume,\nthe radius must increase:\n2\n2\n2 \uf065\uf070\uf064\uf070\uf064 Lr2rLr2V ppppp \uf03d\uf03d (3)\nwhere \u03b52 is the PZT strain in the 2-direction. The Young's modulus for our piezoelectric material, in\nthe circumferential (2) direction, is the same as that in the 1-direction, as explained above, defined as:\n42\n2\n1\n1\n11\n\uf065\n\uf073\n\uf065\n\uf073\nY \uf03d\uf03d (4)\nSubstitution gives the component of the piezo compliance due to expansion in the 2-direction:\n11\n3\n2\nYt\nLr\n2\nP\nV\np\npp\n\uf070\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n(5)\nSecondly, we shall consider the effect of an increase in the length of the piezo (expansion in the\n1-direction) caused by the pressure increase. The tension force in the piezo walls must balance the\npressure over the end of the cylinder:\n1\n2\n1 \uf073\uf070\uf064\uf070 tr2PrF ppp \uf03d\uf03d (6)\nThe increase in volume is:\npppp LrLrV 1\n22\n1 \uf065\uf070\uf064\uf070\uf064 \uf03d\uf03d (7)\nSubstitution gives the compliance due to length increases:\n11\n3\n1\nYt\nLr\n2P\nV\np\npp\uf070\n\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 (8)\nAnd the total piezo compliance is the sum of the two compliances in equations (8) and (5).\n11\n3\n.

They were supported by end couplings with a\nthin glue line, so we assume that the circular window was effectively constrained in both position and\nangle around the circumference of its aperture. For these conditions, the deflection h of a thin window\nunder a differential pressure \u03b4P is given by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger [8]:\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 Pra\ntY\nvh\n2\n\uf064\n22\n3\nww\n2\nw\n64\n112\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d (10)\nwhere vw is the Poisson's ratio for the window, Yw is its Young's modulus, tw is its thickness, a is its\nunsupported radius and r is the radial distance from the 1-axis.

Combining\nthe total compliance with equation (1) gives;\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf06b\n\uf070\n\uf072\n\uf062\nc\np\npp\np\nV\ntY\nLr\nC\nE\nP\n11\n3\n0 2\n5\n(14)\nThis enables the response of the piezo to be calculated.\n2.4 PZT response\nThe PZT electrodes were attached to the inner and outer surfaces of the cylinder. The stress across the\npiezo produces a net polarisation, and a current flows from one electrode via a pre-amplifier, putting\nthe PZT into a short-circuit condition. We used a transimpedance amplifier, with feedback resistor R,\nwhich converted the current output to a voltage signal. The charge on the piezo electrodes, q, acts to\nbalance the induced electric field. Our PZT was poled in the 3-direction, so we need the ratio of\napplied stress in the 1- and 2-directions, to displacement in the 3-direction, which is given by the\nmaterial constant d31[11] (equal to d32) and defined as follows:\n2\n2\n1\n1\n31\n\uf073\uf070\uf073\uf070 Lr2\nq\nLr2\nq\nd\npppp\n\uf03d\uf03d (15)\nThe total charge q across the piezo is then given by the sum of q1 and q2, and the voltage output \u0424 \nfrom the preamplifier is the product of the current and the transimpedance:\nt\nP\nt\nLrdR\nt\nqR\np\npp\nout\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0d7\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf03d\uf046\n2\n313\uf070 (16)\nSubstitution from equation (14) gives the following expression for \u0424out:\n\uf028 \uf029 t\nE\nLr+YtVC\nrLYdR\npppcp\npp\nout\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0d7\uf03d\uf046\n3\n11\n2\n1131\n52\n6\n\uf06b\uf070\uf072\n\uf06b\uf062\uf070\n(17)\nBeer\u2019s Law states that at any given wavelength \uf06c, the energy absorbed by the fluid in the cell is given\nby:\n\uf028 \uf029\uf06c)(1010 \uf06c\uf061\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 I\nt\nE (18)\nwhere I is the incident light power, \uf06c is the optical pathlength in cm and \uf061(\uf06c) is the absorption\ncoefficient of the fluid in cm-1. In fact, \u03b1 should be considered as the sum of the absorption coefficient\nof the analyte alone, plus the background absorption coefficient of the water itself. The magnitude of\nthe photoacoustic signal is then given, for small absorption coefficients (\u03b1 \uf06c <<1), by:\n6\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029tI\nLr+YtVC\nrLYdR\npppcp\npp\nout 03\n11\n2\n1131\n52\n14\n\uf061\n\uf06b\uf070\uf072\n\uf06b\uf062\uf070 \uf06c\n\uf0bb\uf046 (19)\nThis equation may be simplified by introducing a geometrical factor, \uf047, given by the ratio of (i) the\nwater enclosed by the cylindrical PZT (\uf070rp2Lp) to (ii) the total volume of water enclosed by the whole\ncell, including the end couplings (Vc). Its value lies between 0 and 1, a high value indicating that the\ncell\u2019s end couplings are relatively small.\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029tI\nr+YtC\nYdR\nppp\nout 0\n11\n1131\n52\n14\n\uf061\n\uf06b\uf072\n\uf06b\uf062\n\uf047\n\uf047\n\uf0bb\uf046\n\uf06c (20)\nIt should be noted that several of the variables above have a strong dependence on temperature. In\nparticular, the value of \uf062, and therefore the magnitude of the PA signal, pass through zero at 4\uf0b0C[10].\n3 Optimisation of the photoacoustic cell design\nEquation (19) shows how the photoacoustic signal might be maximised by careful choice of the cell\ndesign. Firstly, the optimum piezoelectric element has a wall thickness tp as thin as possible. This is\nlikely to be a practical constraint, because many piezoelectric materials are brittle ceramics and\nunavailable as very thin elements. Secondly, it is desirable that the PZT should enclose as much of the\noptical path length as possible, to maximise the detected signal. Dead volume (giving a small value of\n\u0413) decreases the level of the signal because of its bulk compliance, and the analysis here quantifies \nRosengren\u2019s conclusion that dead volume should be minimised[5]. We would also therefore like to\nreduce the radius of the piezo to a minimum, to reduce the value of Vc. In practice this may be limited\nby the radius of the incident optical beam, because otherwise stray light might strike the walls of the\ncell and produce a spurious signal. Finally, a high sensitivity of the piezo to stress, expressed as d31, is\ndesirable.\nFor trace analysis, we consider a long optical path length to be desirable, however equation (20) holds\ndifferent recommendations for different regimes, which we can consider as follows.\n(a) Very thin-walled piezoelectric cylinder ( \uf047\uf0e1\uf0e1 pp rYt \uf06b52 11 )\nIn this regime, equation (20) reduces to the following for small \u03b1 \uf06c .\n\uf028 \uf029tI\nrC\nYdR\npp\nout 0\n1131\n5\n14\n\uf061\n\uf072\n\uf062 \uf06c\n\uf0bb\uf046 (21)\nHere we can see that a long cell is desirable, regardless of the length of the PZT element, so long as\nthe technical challenge of a low tp can be met. In our case (see section 4), this would be satisfied by\nhaving a thickness tp<< 0.3mm, which was difficult to achieve with a free-standing piezo device.\n7(b) Thick-walled piezoelectric cylinder ( \uf047\uf0f1\uf0f1 pp rYt \uf06b52 11 )\nFor a cylindrical cell, \uf06cpL\uf03d\uf047 and, again for small \u03b1 \uf06c ,\n\uf028 \uf029tI\ntC\nLdR\npp\np\nout 0\n31\n2\n14\n\uf061\n\uf072\n\uf06b\uf062\n\uf0bb\uf046 (22)\nSo in this regime, the analysis predicts no benefit from an increase in the full cell length per se, except\nwhere that may also lead to an increase in the PZT length Lp.\n(c) Intermediate case.\nOur experimental design would actually fall into an intermediate case for which the PZT wall\nthickness is low, but not as low as we would ideally like. In this case the full analysis using equation\n(20) is needed to predict the system response.\n4 Experimental\nA cylindrical photoacoustic cell was built and evaluated, as shown in Figure 2. The piezoelectric\ntransducer consisted of a cylinder of length 25mm, radius 6mm and thickness 0.79mm, made of PZT-\n5A which has a high value of the piezoelectric constant d31 = (171\u00b134)\uf0b410-12mV-1[11], and was\navailable as a long, thin, thin-walled cylinder. The Young\u2019s modulus was Y11 = (6.1\u00b11.2)\uf0b41010Pa. The\noptical path length was 47mm, giving a cell volume of 5.3\uf0b410-6 m3. The windows were made from\n3mm thick fused silica (Suprasil) with \u03bd=0.17 [12] and Y=7.31 \uf0b4 1010 Pa[9], and had an unsupported\nradius a of 6mm. Their compliance was estimated using equation (12) to be negligible in comparison\nwith that of the enclosed water and the PZT. Two end couplings, to permit entry of the sample fluid,\nwere made of 7mm thick stainless steel; their compliance was calculated using equation (9), and also\nfound to be negligible. A screw and gasket in one end coupling allowed the cell to be sealed.\nsilica\nwindow\nstainless\nsteel\nPZT\noptical\npath\nFigure 2.

The photoacoustic detector was\nenclosed within an isolation chamber to minimise the effects of environmental acoustic noise.\nExcitation of the PA signal was achieved using a 678nm laser diode module (RS 194-004), which was\nsquare wave modulated using a signal generator (Thurlby Thandar TG220) at a frequency of 110Hz,\ncorresponding to a region of low noise for photoacoustic detection. The rms modulated power was\nestimated to be 1.4\u00b10.2 mW, measured using a large area silicon photodiode (Centronic\nOST100\/7CQ) and pre-amplifier whose responsivity at 678nm was determined in the following way.\nFirst, we used a fibre pigtailed source at 780nm in combination with a commercial, calibrated optical\nfibre optic power meter (Megger OTP 510), to calibrate the large area photodiode at 780nm. Secondly,\nwe calculated the responsivity of the large area photodiode by using its quoted responsivity curve,\nrelying on repeatability of relative changes along the curve to give the responsivity at 678nm. Finally\nwe estimated the rms power from the modulated 678nm laser diode using the large area photodiode\nand pre-amplifier in combination with a lock-in amplifier (EG+G 5210) of the type used in subsequent\nexperiments. The measured signal was also recorded on a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO, Hitachi\nVC-6175) for subsequent analysis.\nlaser diode\nmodule\npre-amp\nacoustic isolation\nchamber\nlock-in\namplifier\ndigital storage\noscilloscope\nsignal\ngenerator\nbandpass\nfilter\nref in\nFigure 3. System configuration for photoacoustic detection.\nThe light was focused into the cell as shown in Figure 3 with a maximum beam diameter at the cell\nwindows of less than 3mm, and carefully aligned, to minimise the possibility of light striking the walls\nof the PZT. Stray light was reduced by an aperture, formed by four razor blades, between the laser\ndiode and the lens. The bandpass filter (EG+G 5113) was set to transmit signals between 30Hz and\n3kHz, with a roll-off of 6dB \/ decade either side of this passband. It also amplified the signal by a\nfactor of 10. Results were recorded by a lock-in amplifier (EG+G 5210) with an integration time\nconstant of 100s, and a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO, Hitachi VC-6175).\nThe pre-amplifier took the form of a simple transimpedance amplifier, shown in Figure 4. At low\nfrequencies, the PZT was mainly capacitive, with a capacitance of approximately 18nF, and was\neffectively short-circuited by the pre-amplifier, so that it discharged itself through the feedback\nresistor, R. With the PZT connected to the pre-amplifier, the cell full of water, and electrical and\nacoustic screening in place, the noise spectrum was determined (using an HP3589A Spectrum\nanalyser) to be approximately 3\uf06dV Hz-1\/2 rms at 110Hz; electrical pick-up at this frequency was\nminimal.\n9v n\niPZT\n10M\uf057\n4.7pF\n-\nOPA\n627\nFigure 4.

The cell was filled with a solution of various\nconcentrations of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in de-ionised water. KMnO4 is known to be a\ngood standard for use as a photoacoustic absorber[13], because it doesn't fluoresce when excited at\n678nm and delivers heat quickly to the solvent. Its absorption spectrum, measured using a diode array\nspectrophotometer (HP 8452A) with a 4cm pathlength cell, is shown in Figure 6. The relative\nemission of the laser diode, measured using the same instrument, has been superimposed.\n10\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n0\n0.1\n0.2\nwavelength \/ nm\n\u03b1\n.\/\ncm\n-1\n0.3\n600 700\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n800\nFigure 6.

Inset: Emission of red laser diode (arbitrary units, dashed line)\nsuperimposed on the absorption spectrum.\nPotassium permanganate solutions were made up by dilution of a standard that consisted of a known\ndilution of solid KMnO4. The relative concentrations of these solutions were checked by measuring\ntheir absorption at 678nm using the spectrophotometer. However, for the weakest solutions it was not\npossible to do this with accuracy and so the absorption at 678nm was inferred by measurement at\n530nm, where the absorption was higher. This method was also used to check the stability of the test\nsolutions over the period of experimentation. KMnO4 is known to be unstable in the presence of\nreducing agents but no evidence was seen for any significant deterioration of our test solutions, to\nwithin the limits of the spectrometer, or to within \u00b13%, whichever was the higher.\nThe experimental procedure was as follows. The cell was rinsed with the solution to be tested,\ncarefully filled so as not to incorporate any air bubbles, and sealed using the screw and gasket. The\nacoustic chamber lid was secured, and the measurement could begin. Readings were taken from the\nlock-in amplifier, once it had stabilised.\n5 Results\n5.1 Form of the photoacoustic signal\nFigure 7 shows the appearance of one signal recorded by the oscilloscope, averaged over 256 sweeps\nand further smoothed by averaging over each set of 16 points (the total number of points for each trace\nwas 4000). Also shown is the measured laser diode output, which gives the expected photoacoustic\nsignal, calculated using equations (23) and (18). The shape of the signal is in good agreement with our\nprediction, but its magnitude is smaller than predicted by a factor of approximately 4. (The laser diode\noutput was not a perfect square wave, because we were modulating it at a frequency close to its lower\nlimit.)\n11\n0\n2\n0\n4\n0 10 20 30 40\n0.1\n0.2\n50\nlaser diode\noutput\nmeasured\nsignal\npredicted\nsignal \uf0b4 1\/4\ntime \/ ms\nmV\nmW\nFigure 7.

We\nestimated the total level of absorption \u03b1 of each sample by using the measured absorptions of the\nKMnO4 relative to the background, and summing an additional expected signal due to absorption by\nthe water itself (taken to be 4\uf0b410-3cm-1 at 678nm[3,14] ). The rms modulated power from the laser diode,\nmeasured as described in section 4, was then used to calculate the expected signal given by equations\n(23) and (18). As expected, Figure 8 (a) shows that the signals reached a maximum value as the\nabsorption coefficient increased, at high absorptions (approaching \uf061=1). The signals also reached a\nminimum at the level of the water absorption, as expected. For small absorption coefficients we can\nsubtract the signal due to deionised water alone; this is expected to follow the linear prediction of\nequation (20) and to improve discrimination of the low absorption coefficients of the analyte itself, as\nillustrated by Figure 8 (b).\n12\n10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n\u03b1 \/ cm-1\nvo\nlta\nge\nou\ntp\nut\n\/\uf06d\nV\n10\nvo\nlta\nge\nou\ntp\nut\n\/\uf06d\nV\n100\n30\n300\nwater\nonly\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03\n0\n5\n10\n15\n\u03b1 \/ cm-1\nwater\n(1\u03c3)\n(a) (b)\nexperiment\ntheory\nFigure 8.

The trace marked \u201ctheory\u201d was\ncalculated using equations (23) and (18).\nThe results due to KMnO4 absorption were smaller than expected by a factor of approximately 4.\nThere are a number of possible explanations. Although some of the reduction is attributable to the\nlarge error in the predicted responsivity resulting from uncertainty in the material constants in the\nPZT, this is insufficient to account for much of the error. It is suggested that the entire system might\nnot be as efficient as expected, because of a higher cell compliance than predicted, which could have\nresulted from two effects that were not modelled. It is unlikely that either of these effects could have\nbeen readily avoided in the present design. It is possible (i) that the PZT element were able to bow\noutwards slightly in the middle, allowing it to increase its compliance without a compensating increase\nin signal levels, and \/ or (ii) that the adhesive joints holding it to the stainless steel end couplings were\nable to flex, contributing a second unquantified compliance that could have reduced signal levels.\nThese latter joints were necessarily made of a strong, waterproof and electrically insulating material\n(epoxy resin) that happened to be more flexible than the other cell materials. The PZT cylinder had\nbeen placed in small recesses in the end coupling, with the adhesive used to fill the gaps such that the\nresulting bond line was approximately 0.5mm wide (radial direction) \uf0b4 1mm deep (longitudinal\ndirection).\nThe asymptotic value of the PA signals at low levels of KMnO4, ie the signal due to water absorption\nalone, was approximately at the predicted value. However, if the system responsivity is lower than\nexpected, this asymptote would not be the result of water absorption, as expected, but of some other\neffect such as window noise[2], stray light hitting the cell walls, or environmental acoustic noise. (The\nexpected level of noise from the detector is small in comparison with these results, being\napproximately 0.3\uf06dV rms for an integration period of 100s.) The smallest detectable absorption\ncoefficient was approximately 3\uf0b410-3 cm-1 (SNR=1). This would not presently offer improved\ndetection limits over straightforward spectrophotometry[15]; further advantages are needed to make PA\ndetection attractive, such as its known tolerance to light scattering in turbid samples. However, for a\nphotoacoustic technique the detection limit represents efficient use of low levels of incident power,\ncorresponding to the absorption of light with an rms modulated power of 50\uf06dW.\nEquations (20) and (21), if valid, indicate the potential for improvement in the signal to noise ratio for\nan ideally thin transducer whose properties are otherwise unchanged. The limit of improvement for\nthinner transducers is by a factor of 4.5 on this analysis.\n13\n6 Conclusion\nA simple closed, cylindrical photoacoustic cell has been designed, built, and used to demonstrate\nphotoacoustic detection of an absorber in aqueous solution, excited by continuous-wave sources,\nmodulated at relatively low frequencies. For low power light sources such as laser diodes, it was\nparticularly important that the responsivity of the cell was optimised. To this end, a theory of the\noperation of the cell has been developed, tested, and used to optimise the cell design, within the limits\nof practicality.\nThe ideal detector, according to our predictions, has a sensor whose compliance is large compared to\nthat of the water enclosed by the cell. For our cylinder of PZT-5A, this would have required a wall\nthickness of tp<<0.3mm. Instead, using the thinnest commercially available PZT element with a wall\nthickness of 0.79mm, and potassium permanganate in aqueous solution as a standard absorber, we\nhave demonstrated photoacoustic signals that were a factor of four smaller than our predictions, for the\nmost strongly absorbing solutions. It is suggested that the cell compliance may have been greater than\nwe estimated, which would have reduced the signal level. The minimum detectable absorbance of the\nsystem was approximately 3\uf0b410-3 cm-1, corresponding to the absorption of light with a modulated\npower of only 50\uf06dW rms.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work was supported by North West Water Ltd and by the Department of Trade and Industry,\nunder the Teaching Company Scheme.\nReferences\n[1] A.
