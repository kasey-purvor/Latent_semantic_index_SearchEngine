We study the effect of a control beam on a \u039b electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) system in 87Rb. The control beam couples one ground state to\nanother excited state forming a four level N\u2013system. Phase coherent beams to drive\nthe N\u2013system are produced using a double injection scheme. We show that the control\nbeam can be used to Stark shift or split the EIT resonance. Finally, we show that the\nwhen the control beam is on-resonance one observes a Doppler-free and sub-natural\nabsorptive resonance with a width of order 100 kHz. Crucially, this narrow absorptive\nresonance only occurs when atoms with a range of velocities are present, as is the case\nin a room temperature vapour.\nPACS numbers: 42.50.Gy, 42.50.Hz, 42.60.Fc\nThe interplay between two driving fields and a 3-level atom provides the simplest system\nfor quantum interference phenomena [1]. The understanding of coherent atom-field\ninteractions has facilitated such advances as the slowing and storing of light [2, 3, 4],\nlasing without inversion [5] and magnetometery [6]. Common to all these is the process of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [7], the signature of which is a narrow\nregion of reduced absorption around the resonant frequency of a probe field. Such\nspectral features, often called dark resonances, arise from the superposition of atomic\nstates and driving fields. This coherent non\u2013linearity can lead to enhanced electro-optic\neffects [8] with possible applications in photonic phase gates [9].\nMore complicated systems of EIT are possible when one adds further driving fields\nand\/or atomic states. For example, switching between subluminal and supraluminal\nlight propagation has been studied in three level systems using a third driving field\n[10, 11]. Further to this, when four atomic states are coupled by three driving fields a\ndouble dark state results [12, 13]. Most work on four level systems has concentrated\non three ground terms and one excited state. Such systems have been shown to exhibit\nenhanced Kerr non-linearities [14] and sub to superluminal light switching [15]. Another\ntype of four level system is the N \u2013system where there are two ground and two excited\nlevels. This system is of particular interest due to the strongly enhanced ac Kerr effect\n[16]. In addition, electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) has been theoretically\nNarrow absorptive resonances in a four-level atomic system 2\ntreated in such a system [17] and experimental observation of a system using the D1\nand D2 transitions of Rubidium have been made [18].\nRecently, we demonstrated how by coupling a \u039b system EIT to a Rydberg state,\none can enable electro-optic control of the ground state coherence [19]. In this paper,\nwe report the experimental observation and theoretical origin of narrow N \u2013system\nresonances in an atomic 87Rb vapour at room temperature. Starting with the \u2018signature\u2019\npeak in transmission associated with EIT, a third control field is introduced which\ncouples the system to a fourth state. When the control field is off resonance we observe\nthe ac Stark shift or Autler\u2013Townes splitting of the EIT resonance. However, when\nthe control field is on-resonance we observe that the EIT peak inverts, i.e., the medium\nis switched from transmitting to absorbing. Surprisingly, this absorptive resonance is\nboth sub-Doppler and sub-natural, despite the fact that the final coupling is to a short\nlived excited state. Although similar features have been observed previously [20, 21],\nthe sub-natural character of such resonances was not shown; we estimate a width of over\n20 MHz in the latter work. We show that this sub-natural character of the N \u2013system\nresonance arises due to the contribution of off-resonant velocity classes in the thermal\nvapour. For these velocity classes the doppler shift experienced by an atom is greater\nthan the decay rate of the excited state. Thus the effect is not predicted for cold atomic\nensembles where the atomic motion is negligible. The enhanced absorption effect is\ndemonstrated even when the Zeeman degeneracy of the ground state is lifted, thus the\neffect is distinct from EIA due to transfer of coherence [22] or transfer of population [23]\nwhich arises due to degenerate levels. The ability to switch between narrow transparent\nand absorptive resonance or between sub\u2013 and supra\u2013luminal propagation is of interest\nin applications such as controlled pulse propagation and photon storage.\n1. Theory\nWe consider a 4-level atomic system consisting of a typical \u039b system of two hyperfine\nground terms, |1\u3009 and |3\u3009, and an excited third level, |2\u3009. An additional excited state\nlevel, |4\u3009, creates the N \u2013 type system shown in figure 1. The four levels are coupled\nby probe, coupling and control laser fields with Rabi frequencies \u212621, \u212632 and \u212643,\nrespectively. In the weak probe limit [24], we solve the optical Bloch equations for the\nfour level atom with co-propagating \u212621 and \u212632 and counter propagating \u212643 fields.\nThe Hamiltonian for this 4-level system is\nH =\n1\n2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u220621 \u2212 kv \u212621 0 0\n\u212621 \u220632 \u2212 kv \u212632 0\n0 \u212632 0 \u212643\n0 0 \u212643 \u220643 + kv\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n(1)\nwith atomic velocity v and detunings \u2206ij as in figure 1. The wavevector k, has the same\nmagnitude for all fields. The decay terms are given by \u03b3ij = (\u0393i +\u0393j)\/2, where \u0393i is the\nnatural decay rate of state |i\u3009. In this system \u03932 = \u03934 = \u0393 = (2pi\u00d7) 6 MHz and \u03b333 is\nNarrow absorptive resonances in a four-level atomic system 3\ntaken as (2pi\u00d7) 100 kHz, to account for the transit time broadening.

Relaxation processes are included using \u03b3, the decay matrix. The\nimaginary part of the coherence between |1\u3009 and |2\u3009 corresponds to the absorption of\nthe probe beam.

As previously\nnoted [13, 25, 26, 27] a thermal ensemble has a narrower EIT resonance due to the\ncontribution from off-resonant velocity classes, as seen in figures 2(a) and (b). The\napplication of the third laser field to a cold atom system only serves to broaden and split\nthe transmission peak (figure 2(c)), whereas for thermal atoms the resonance switches\nfrom transmitting to absorbing (figure 2(d)). The largest absorption occurs when the\nRabi frequencies of the control and coupling beams are equal. This condition gives rise\nto a Doppler\u2013free eigenstate as discussed in [20]. Crucially, the \u223c 100 kHz width of this\npronounced absorptive resonance remains both sub-Doppler and sub-natural, despite the\nadditional coupling to an excited state and the odd number of laser beams. This width\nis primarily limited by transit time broadening, whilst the height decreases for higher\nexcited state decay rates. Limiting the number of velocity classes in the calculation\nshows the evolution of the EIT resonance into an absorptive feature when kv \u2265 \u0393.\n2. Experimental Setup\nTo observe the narrow resonance features expected in the EIT N \u2013system, it is necessary\nto make phase coherent laser beams separated in frequency by the ground state hyperfine\nsplitting (6.8 GHz for 87Rb) [28].

In both cases \u212632=(2pi\u00d7) 5 MHz and states |2\u3009 and |4\u3009 have a decay of\n\u0393=(2pi\u00d7) 6 MHz, while \u039333 = (2pi\u00d7) 100 kHz. In (c) and (d) \u212643=(2pi\u00d7) 5 MHz. The\nprobe and coupling beams co-propagate while the control beam counter-propagates.\nadopted to achieve this end. For instance, the injection locking of two diode lasers using\nthe \u00b11 diffraction orders from a high frequency acousto-optic modulator (AOM) [29], or\ninjection locking of two diode lasers to the sidebands produced by current modulation\nof the master laser [30]. Another approach is to use electro-optic modulation to produce\nsidebands at the required frequency before injection locking a slave laser. A drawback\nto this approach is that typically the spectral purity of the emerging beam is poor and\nrequires filtering of the carrier frequency using a stabilised cavity [31].\nIn this work we produce the required frequencies using electro\u2013optic modulation\nfollowed by a double injection locking technique. A schematic of the experimental\nsetup is shown in figure 3 (a). A commercial 780.24 nm extended cavity diode laser is\nstabilised to the 5s 2S1\/2(F = 2) \u2192 5p 2P3\/2(F \u2032 = 2) transition in 87Rb (|2\u3009 \u2192 |3\u3009 in\nfigure 1) using polarisation spectroscopy [32]. A part of this light is separated using a\nbeamsplitter and is used as the coupling beam.\nThe remainder of the light propagates through an electro-optic modulator (EOM)\n(New Focus 4851). The light frequency spectrum at this point is composed of the carrier\nfrequency and two sidebands at \u00b16.8 GHz. Each sidebands has a relative intensity of\n2% of the carrier beam. Around 200 \u00b5W of this light is then used to seed a free\nNarrow absorptive resonances in a four-level atomic system 5\nF=2 F\u2019=2\u00ae\nF=2 F\u2019=3\u00ae\nAOMs\nEOM\nRbCell\n1 Slave\nst\nF=1 F\u2019=2\u00ae\nMaster\n2 Slave\nnd FR\nFR\n(a)\n-200 0 200\n10\n-4\n10\n-2\n10\n0\nFrequency (MHz)\nT\nra\nn\nsm\nis\nsi\no\nn\nMaster\n2nd Slave\n(b)\nFigure 3: (a) Schematic of the optical setup used to generate sidebands at 6.8 GHz. A\nmaster laser is locked on the F = 2\u2192 F \u2032 = 2 resonance and the beam passes through an\nelectro-optic modulator (EOM) at 6.8 GHz. This light then passes through a Faraday\nRotator (FR) and injection locks a slave laser to the lower sideband. The light from this\nlaser then seeds a second slave laser; the output of which is combined with the master\nlight on a polarising beam splitter cube and coupled into a fiber. The third control\nbeam frequency is derived from a double-passed acousto-optic modulator (AOM). This\nlight counter-propagates with the master and slave light through the thermal vapour\nRb cell. (b) The spectral purity of the second slave laser is observed by measuring the\ntransmission through a scanning Fabry-Perot etalon with free spectral range \u223c 750 MHz.\nNo component of master light on the second slave laser frequency spectrum is detected\ndown to the noise level; a suppression of at least -40 dB.\nrunning diode laser which locks to the lower sideband [33, 34]. This is optimised using a\ncombination of current and temperature tuning, resulting in a purity of around -20 dB.\nTo achieve higher spectral purity and greater stability, a second slave laser is injected\nwith the output of the first. The spectral output of this third laser, shown in figure 3(b)\nhas carrier suppression to the level of at least -40 dB. This light is then resonant with\nthe 5s 2S1\/2(F = 2)\u2192 5p\n2P3\/2(F\n\u2032 = 2) transition (|1\u3009 \u2192 |2\u3009 in figure 1) and is used as\nthe probe beam. For near resonant coupling to the 5s 2S1\/2(F = 2)\u2192 5p\n2P3\/2(F\n\u2032 = 3)\n(|3\u3009 \u2192 |4\u3009 in figure 1) transition two AOMs shift a fraction of the master light 267 MHz\nto the blue, to give the control beam. For larger detunings the frequency requirements\nare less stringent, as the light is detuned further than the Doppler width. In this case\nanother external cavity diode laser is used, which is not stabilised relative to the other\nlasers.\nThe probe and coupling beams are combined on a polarisation beam splitting cube\nand coupled into a polarisation maintaining single mode fiber. The output of the fiber\nis collimated and propagates through a magnetically shielded, Rb cell of length 75 mm\nas shown in figure 3(a). The probe and coupling beams have a waist of 1.3 mm (1\/e2\nradius) and have orthogonal linear polarisations. The control beam counter-propagates\nwith the other two beams, as in equation (1). By changing the drive frequency of the\nEOM the probe beam can be scanned through the F = 1 \u2192 F \u2032 = 2 resonance. A\nNarrow absorptive resonances in a four-level atomic system 6\npolarising beam splitting cube is used to pick off the coupling beam, allowing the probe\ntransmission to be monitored as a function of detuning.\n3. Results and Discussion\nTransmission spectra for the N \u2013system for an off\u2013resonant control beam are shown in\nfigure 4(a). Using a probe power of 20 \u00b5W, coupling power of 110 \u00b5W and no control\nbeam a narrow EIT signal of width \u223c 70 kHz is observed. This width is limited by\ntransit\u2013time broadening. When a control beam is added, detuned below resonance by\napproximately 5 GHz as shown in figure 4(c), the resulting spectra show that the EIT\nfeature broadens and shifts to lower frequency. This shift can be understood as an ac\nStark shift of the ground state, |3\u3009. In figure 4(b) the measured shift is shown relative\nto the predicted ac Stark shift: \u2206E = \u00b1h\u00af\u21262\/4\u2206, where \u2126 and \u2206 are the control beam\nRabi frequency and detuning respectively. The broadening of the EIT peak is expected\nas the shift experienced by each atom in the ensemble is dependent upon its position\nrelative to the spatially inhomogeneous intensity of the control laser field.\n(a)\nFrequency(MHz)\nP\no\nw\ner\n(m\nW\n)\nD\nT\n0 1-1-2\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n0\n21\n30\n41\nControl Power (mW)\nS\nh\nif\nt\n(M\nH\nz)\n0 10 20 30 40\n0.0\n0.4\n0.6\n0.2\n(b)\nF=1\nF=2\nF =3\u2019\nF\u2019=2\n~5 GHz\nStark Shift\nProbe\nCoupling\nControl\n(c)\nFigure 4: (a) Change in transmission as a function of detuning from the 5s2S1\/2(F =\n1)\u2192 5p2P3\/2(F \u2032 = 2) level.

(c) Level scheme for the N \u2013system A far off-resonant control field is used to shift\nthe F = 2 ground state\nSimilar characteristics are seen when the Zeeman degeneracy is lifted by applying\n\u223c1 G axial magnetic field. In this case three different EIT peaks corresponding to EIT\n\u039b systems consisting of different mF states are observed, see figure 5(a). Figure 5(b)\nshows the spectra for the N \u2013system with the 110 \u00b5W control beam detuned by -5 MHz.\nIn this small detuning limit the effect of the control beam is to Autler-Townes split\nthe EIT resonance [35] rather that just shift it as in figure 4(a). The results in figures\n5(a) and (b) can be understood by considering the couplings for \u03c3+ \u03c3+ transitions\nin figure 5(c). For the \u039b system, due to the beam wavevectors being in the same\ndirection as the magnetic field, no pi transitions are expected. This configuration gives\nresonances at three frequencies \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03c7; the case of \u03c3\u2212 \u03c3\u2212 beams is identical due\nto symmetry. For mixed transitions, \u03c3+ \u03c3\u2212 and \u03c3\u2212 \u03c3+, the resonances also occur at\nthese three probe frequencies. One example is |2,\u22121\u3009 \u2192 |2, 0\u3009 \u2192 |1, 1\u3009 which occurs\nNarrow absorptive resonances in a four-level atomic system 7\nat the same probe frequency as the \u03b2 system. When the control laser field is applied\nto the ensemble to create the N \u2013system, an asymmetric Autler\u2013Townes splitting of the\nEIT feature is observed [35]. The relative height of the components are determined by\noptical pumping effects.

(b) Despite the lifted Zeeman degeneracy using\na \u223c 1 Gauss field, the absorptive resonance is still seen. The relative peak heights\nare determined by optical pumping. (c) Level scheme for observation of sub-natural\nenhanced absorption. Both the coupling and control lasers are on resonance, and the\nprobe laser is scanned through resonance.\nFinally, we consider the case of the control beam tuned to resonance as shown\nin figure 6(c). Here the narrow transparency peak is observed to switch to an\nabsorptive resonance with sub\u2013natural linewidth as seen in figure 6(a). This result is in\nNarrow absorptive resonances in a four-level atomic system 8\nqualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions presented in section 1. However,\nthe enhanced absorption is smaller than that predicted in figure 2 due to multiple\ncontributions from the 5p 2P3\/2 hyperfine states, i.e., the system is not composed of\nonly 4 states as was assumed in the theory section. The same effect, i.e. a switching\nbetween transparency and absorption is also observed when the Zeeman degeneracy is\nlifted, figure 6(b). This demonstrates that the enhanced absorption observed in the\nN \u2013system has a different origin to the EIA effect occurring in degenerate systems [17].\nThere are a number of additional interesting features of this result. In particular the\nenhanced absorption resonance clearly has a sub-natural linewidth (of order 100 kHz)\neven though it is induced by coupling to a state with a width of 6 MHz. As shown in\nthe theory section this arises due to the contribution of off resonant velocity classes.\nThe technique could be employed to enhance the optical depth of an otherwise optically\nthin sample with potential applications in detecting weak absorption lines [36] or light\nstorage. Future work will focus on the D1 line where the larger hyperfine splitting in\nthe excited state (362 MHz) means that the larger absorption predicted by the model\n(figure 2) can be observed.\n4. Summary\nIn summary, we present a novel scheme to create phase coherent laser beams separated\nin frequency by the Rb hyperfine ground state splitting by double injection locking.\nUsing this set up we demonstrate a narrow absorptive resonance in a 4 level N \u2013system.\nThis resonance is both Doppler-free and sub-natural despite the coupling to an excited\nstate. This behaviour is shown to be a feature of the thermal atomic system and is\npredicted not to occur for cold atoms.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank I. G. Hughes and M. P. A.
