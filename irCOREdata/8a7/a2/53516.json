Introduction \nIt is well known that chaotic behavior may occur in a second-order digital filter \nwith two\u2019s complement arithmetic [Chua, 1988, 1990; Galias, 1992; Kocarev, 1993, \n1996; Wu, 1993; Yu, 2001]. For the characteristic equation of the all-pole linearized \ndigital filter being bzaz \uf02d\uf0d7\uf02d2 , where the filter parameters \uf028 \uf029ba,  are in the set \n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d1 and 2:, \uf02d\uf03d\uf0a3 baba , the phase portrait of the state variables, using the direct \nmethod of implementation, may exhibit one of three types of trajectories, namely the \ntype I, II, and III trajectories. The type I trajectory corresponds to a single rotated \nellipse. For the type II trajectory, there are more than one rotated and translated \nellipses. The type III trajectory is characterized by an elliptical fractal pattern [Chua, \n1998, 1990; Galias, 1992; Wu, 1993; Yu, 2001]. The state vector \uf028 \uf029kx  is periodic for \nthe type I and type II trajectories, but aperiodic for the type III trajectory. When the \nfilter parameters \uf028 \uf029ba,  are in the set \uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d1 and 2:, \uf02d\uf03d\uf03e baba , the phase portrait \nexhibits a dense countable set of discontinuous lines, and shows a random-like chaotic \n 2 \npattern, illustrating that the state vector \uf028 \uf029kx  is aperiodic. One typical example is that \nwhen 3\uf03da  and 1\uf02d\uf03db , the system will correspond to the well known Arnold-Sinai \ncat map [Kocarev, 1993]. When the filter parameters \uf028 \uf029ba,  are in the set \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf07b 1 and 1:, \uf03e\uf02b\uf03d babba  or \uf028 \uf029\uf07d1 and 1 \uf03e\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d bab , there are some straight lines on \nthe phase portrait [Kocarev, 1996]. The state vector \uf028 \uf029kx  is aperiodic for most of the \ninitial conditions. \nAccording to the existing literature [Kocarev, 1993, 1996], one might expect \nthat when the filter parameters \uf028 \uf029ba,  are on the extended boundaries of the stability \ntriangle, that is, \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf07b or 1 and 1or  1 and 2:, \uf03e\uf02b\uf03d\uf02d\uf03d\uf03e babbaba  \n\uf028 \uf029\uf07d1 and 1 \uf03e\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d bab , then the state vector \uf028 \uf029kx  is aperiodic for most of the initial \nconditions because one of the eigenvalues of the linearized digital filter has magnitude \ngreater than one. However, we show some counter-intuitive simulation results in \nsection 2 that for some filter parameters \uf028 \uf029ba,  on the extended boundaries of the \nstability triangle, the state vector \uf028 \uf029kx  will converge to a periodic orbit after a number \nof iterations, no matter what the initial conditions are. Also, a new pattern on the phase \nportrait is found, which has not been reported before. Finally, a conclusion is \nsummarized in section 3. \n \n2.  Simulation Results \nAccording to our intensive simulations, we have the following observations: \nObservation 1. \nFor the system described in [Chua, 1988, 1990; Galias, 1992; Kocarev, 1993, 1996; \nWu, 1993; Yu, 2001], if \n(i) 1\uf02d\uf03db  and n\nna\n2\n12 \uf02b\uf03d  where \uf07b \uf07d0\\Z\uf0cen , or  \n(ii) 1\uf02b\uf03d ab  and 1\uf03eb  and a  is an odd number, or  \n(iii) 1\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d ab  and 1\uf03eb  and a  is an odd number, \nthen \uf07b \uf07d00 \uf055\uf02b\uf0ce\uf024 Zk  and \uf02b\uf0ce\uf024 ZM  such that \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kMk xx \uf0bb\uf02b  for 0kk \uf0b3\uf022  and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0fe\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d\uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d\uf0ba\uf0ce\uf022\nkx\nkx\nkkxkxkI\n2\n1\n21\n2   where,11 and 11:0 xxx . \uf06e \n 3 \nFigure 1 shows the phase portraits of the system with 1\uf02d\uf03db , initial condition \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\n2.0\n1.0\n0x , and with different values of a . It can be seen from the figure that the \nnumber of points in the phase portrait when 5.2\uf03da  or 25.4\uf02d\uf03da  is much less than \nthat of the case when 3\uf03da  or 4\uf03da . One can verify that when 5.2\uf03da , \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kk xx \uf0bb\uf02b 214  for 163\uf0b3\uf022k , and when 25.4\uf02d\uf03da , \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kk xx \uf0bb\uf02b 54  for 191\uf0b3\uf022k . \nBecause of this quasi-periodic property, the state vector \uf028 \uf029kx  will hit inside a very \nsmall neighborhood of the same point on the phase portrait after one period, so the \nphase portrait only shows a finite number of different points. However, there is no \nsuch quasi-periodic property when 3\uf03da  or 4\uf03da . Instead, there are infinitely many \npoints on the phase portrait, and a random-like chaotic pattern is shown. \nSimilarly, Figure 2 shows the phase portrait and the symbolic sequences of \nsuch a system [Chua, 1988, 1990; Galias, 1992; Kocarev, 1993, 1996; Wu, 1993; Yu, \n2001] with the same initial condition as those of Figure 1, but now 1\uf02b\uf03d ab , and with \ndifferent values of a . It can be seen from the figure that when 3\uf03da  or 5\uf03da , the \nsymbolic sequences become zero and only finitely many points are on the straight lines \nof the phase portrait. One can verify that when 3\uf03da , \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kk xx \uf0bb\uf02b 2  for 28\uf0b3\uf022k , \nand when 5\uf03da , \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kk xx \uf0bb\uf02b 2  for 90\uf0b3\uf022k . On the other hand, there is no such \nquasi-periodic property when 4\uf03da . Hence, there are infinitely many points on those \nstraight lines of the phase portrait. For 1\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d ab , a similar result is obtained, as \nshown in Figure 3. \nIs the above phenomenon true only for some particular initial conditions? We \nhave conducted extensive simulations and find that it is true no matter what initial \nconditions are. Figure 4 shows the phase portrait of such a system [Chua, 1988, 1990; \nGalias, 1992; Kocarev, 1993, 1996; Wu, 1993; Yu, 2001] with 1\uf02d\uf03db , 5.2\uf03da , and \nwith different initial conditions generated by a random number generator. It can be \nverified that the state vector \uf028 \uf029kx  converges to a periodic orbit for those initial \nconditions. And, similar results have been obtained for the case when 1\uf02b\uf03d ab , 3\uf03da , \nor 1\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d ab , 3\uf02d\uf03da , as shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. \nObservation 2. \nFor the system described in [Chua, 1988, 1990; Galias, 1992; Kocarev, 1993, 1996; \n 4 \nWu, 1993; Yu, 2001], if 1\uf02d\uf03db  and n\nna\n2\n12 \uf02b\uf03d  where \uf07b \uf07d4,3,2,1,1,2,3 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf0cen , then a \nnew pattern, which looks like a rotated letter \u2018X\u2019, is exhibited on the phase portrait, no \nmatter what the values of the initial conditions are. The center of the rotated letter is \nlocated at the origin, and the slopes of the \u2018straight lines\u2019 of the rotated letter \u2018X\u2019 are \nequal to the values of the pole locations. \uf06e \nFigures 1 and 4 show examples in which a rotated letter \u2018X\u2019 is exhibited on the \nphase portrait centered at the origin and with slopes of the \u2018straight lines\u2019 being the \nvalues of the pole locations. \n \n3.  Conclusion \nIn this letter, we report that for some filter parameters in the extended \nboundaries of the stability triangle, the state vector will converge to a periodic orbit \nafter a number of iterations, no matter what the initial conditions are. Also, a new \npattern, which looks like a rotated letter \u2018X\u2019, is found. The center of the rotated letter \nis located at the origin, and the slopes of the \u2018straight lines\u2019 of the rotated letter are \nequal to the values of the pole locations. \n \nAcknowledgement \n The work described in this letter was substantially supported by The Hong \nKong Polytechnic University. \n 5 \nReferences \n[1] Chua, L.
