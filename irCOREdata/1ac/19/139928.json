Introduction\nThis paper examines the performance of business group affiliated firms in China and compares\ntheir performance with non-affiliated firms. In particular, we examine whether affiliation to a select\nnumber of \u2018national champion\u2019 groups is associated with superior performance. By the end of 2006\nthere were 2,856 officially recognised business groups in China with 27,950 first- tier subsidiaries,\nemploying around 30 million people directly (SSBa, 2007). Beneath this first-tier, moreover,\nfurther tiers of firms existed. While the full extent of group membership in China is unknown, case\nstudies suggest it may be very large (Nolan, 2001). As such, the influence and reach of China\u2019s\nbusiness groups is already important. From within these 2,856 groups, moreover, a small subset of\naround 100 were selected as \u2018national champion\u2019 trial groups. They have received a variety of\nspecial policies, directly overseen by China\u2019s State Council. These national champion groups are\nthe largest and most institutionally advanced business groups in China (Nolan 2001). Investigating\ntheir performance may shed further light on the role of business groups in China\u2019s notable\neconomic achievements. Here we examine the performance of listed firms that are affiliated with\nthese trial groups. This, we believe, is a relatively clean test of the benefits of group affiliation in\nChina. Our results shed light on matters of policy relevance, as well as on the broader discussion on\nwhether business groups are to be seen as \u2018paragons\u2019 or \u2018parasites\u2019 in the development process\n(Khanna and Yafeh, 2007).\nIn Section 2 we review relevant literature and describe the background to and characteristics of\nthe national champion business groups. Section 3 describes the methodology and data. Section 4\npresents our empirical results. Section 5, going beyond our discussion of affiliate performance,\nraises several further important questions regarding the role of business groups in China today.\nChina\u2019s groups are now absorbing more and more firms and incorporating greater volumes of\nprivate capital. As such, the sphere of influence of state groups has expanded. The clear boundaries\nbetween state and non-state sectors that once existed have become less well defined.\n2. Background and Literature Review\nKhanna and Yafeh (2007) and Morck et al (2005) provide useful reviews of the business group\nliterature which has recently become highly topical. To briefly summarise, a key theme of this\nliterature has been to ask whether business groups may be seen as \u2018paragons\u2019 or \u2018parasites\u2019\n(Khanna and Yafeh, 2007). It is argued, for example, that under certain conditions business groups\nmay provide benefits for member firms. Conversely, at other times there may be costs associated\nwith group membership. Among the benefits of group formation, it has been hypothesised that\ngroups may fill institutional voids that are common in emerging markets (and transition economies\nin particular). By compensating for imperfect or under developed markets in finance, labour, and\nproducts, for example, they may help facilitate exchanges that could not happen through the market\nplace. They thus play a positive role in firm development by reducing transactions costs. On the\nother hand, a number of negative traits may also be associated with business groups, related often\nto their monopoly powers, engagement in rent-seeking activities and association with crony\ncapitalism, moral hazard and excessive and inefficient investment. One much discussed negative\ntrait is that groups may develop pyramidal structures (La Porta et al, 1999; Morck et al, 2005).\nSuch structures allow an apex firm to control numerous other firms without having made\ncommensurate capital investments. This may lead to corporate governance problems and the\n\u2018tunnelling\u2019 of resources away from member firms. Here business groups have the potential to\ndestroy value. Such pyramidal groups, moreover, also allow elites, often families or the state, to\nhave enormous economic influence over vast corporate empires (La Porta et al, 1999). More\ngenerally, it is speculated this may lead to a range of unhealthy macroeconomic impacts, broadly\n3referred to as \u2018economic entrenchment\u2019 (Morck et al 2005, p. 655). In summary, much of the\ncurrent discussion of business groups is dominated by whether they may be seen as paragons or\nparasites (Khanna and Yafeh, 2007).\nBuilding from this debate on the various strengths and weaknesses of business groups, a large\nempirical literature examines whether group affiliated firms perform better than non-group\naffiliated firms. The evidence, however, is rather mixed. Empirical studies comparing unaffiliated\nfirms to firms that are part of bank-centered keiretsus in Japan, for example, show little evidence of\nsuperior performance (Weinstein and Yafeh, 1998). Similarly, Khanna and Palepu (2000a) find that\nbusiness group affiliation in India is negatively correlated with profitability. In contrast, however,\nChang and Choi (1988) find that profits for group-affiliated Korean firms are higher than those of\nindependent firms. Khanna and Palepu (2000b) find that group membership in Chile has a positive\nimpact on both profitability and Tobin\u2019s Q. While there is, therefore, some debate as to the exact\nimpact of business groups, Khanna and Yafeh (2007) in their comprehensive review of the business\ngroup literature note that the performance of such groups may well be related to the particular\ninstitutional environment in which they evolve. Under certain conditions, in other words, business\ngroups may play a positive role.\nWhile interest abounds in business groups, to date only a relatively small literature exists on\nChina\u2019s business groups. Smyth (2000), for example, asks \u2018should China be promoting business\ngroups\u2019? This investigation, while providing valuable observations and analysis, does not\nundertake any new empirical analysis on business groups per se. Instead it is based largely around\na prior literature on large and medium enterprises. Nolan and Wang (1999) and Nolan (2001),\nbased primarily upon case studies, investigate the nature of institutional change within China\u2019s\nlarge business groups in the context of transition and globalisation. Several further papers employ a\nquantitative approach to examine whether and under what conditions affiliated members benefit\nfrom group membership in China. Keister (1998, 2000) examines the performance of 40 of China\u2019s\nlargest groups between 1988 and 1990 using a panel data set. She finds that internal finance\ncompanies (facilitating internal financial markets) and interlocking directorates (which promote\ninformation exchange between group members) are associated with improved performance. She\ntherefore examines the extent to which the internal features of these groups (finance companies, for\nexample) enhance their efficiency. Yiu et al. (2005) examine the profitability of 224 business\ngroups (including all subsidiaries) with another purpose in mind. They wish to find out how groups\nacquire resources and capabilities so that they can become successful agents to promote economic\ntransformation and growth. They find that group profitability is negatively related to what they call\n\u2018endowed resources\u2019 (including such things as the age of the group, the extent of government\nownership and the prevalence of management with government links) but positively related to what\nthey call \u2018acquired resources\u2019. Such resources they argue are acquired through actions such as\nacquisitions, internal capability development and international diversification (Yiu et al 2005). Ma\net al (2006), on the other hand, look to examine how business groups fill \u2018ownership voids\u2019 by\nserving as the direct owners of state owned enterprises in the absence of other private actors. They\nfind that the combination of business group affiliation and state ownership has a positive effect on\nsubsidiary performance. As well, therefore, as substituting for imperfect markets, they argue they\nmay also play an important role in ownership reforms, a point to which we later return.\nFinally, the World Bank (2005) has warned of the dangers of forming business groups with\nstate owned parent companies. They argue such parent companies might use the proceeds from the\nlisting of firms, as well from ongoing earnings to fund intra-group structural reform or ill-advised\ninvestments (such as speculation in commercial real estate). As such they argue, albeit on the basis\nof limited empirical data, that such state owned groups may be especially prone to the\naforementioned tunnelling problem and require reform. We look to also shed further light on this\nquestion.\n4Although Keister (1998, 2000) and Yiu et al. (2005) show that certain group characteristics\nhave positive impacts on performance, they do not directly examine whether group affiliated firms\nperform better than other firms, whereas this is the key objective of our paper. To date, moreover,\nno studies have specifically identified the trial national team groups. We believe, however that\nthese groups provide a particularly good opportunity to investigate the impact of business group\naffiliation, for reasons we now discuss.\n2.l China\u2019s national champions\nChina\u2019s trial groups are much larger and more sophisticated than other groups. In fact, trials and\nexperimentation to develop internationally competitive large business groups can be traced to a\npolicy directive issued by the State Council in December 1991, endorsing 55 business groups to\nundergo influential trial reforms. In April 1997, a second policy directive selected a further 63\ngroups to join the trials (Sutherland 2001). Since this time the number of trial groups has remained\nroughly at 100 with some fluctuation as groups have merged, entered or left. To a great extent the\ndevelopment of the trial groups has adopted the traditional Chinese reform method of using\nincremental steps, and has followed an iterative and bottom up process of experimentation and\nfeedback (Nolan 2001). The precise objectives of the policies, moreover, have evolved over time.\nAmong the most important and consistently stated objectives of the national champion policy,\nhowever, has been to promote institutional change with a view to creating internationally\ncompetitive groups that can lead China\u2019s integration in the world economy (Nolan 2001;\nSutherland 2001).\nTo achieve this objective a variety of policies were introduced to the national champion groups,\nincluding: the development of internal group finance companies; stock market listings; earlier and\ngreater freedoms within the groups giving them greater autonomy in basic decision making;\ngranting of import and export rights; empowerment of the group\u2019s core with special rights to\nincorporate state assets into the group; and the creation of research and technology centres. Table 1\nshows the proportion of national champion business groups and other business groups that have\nadopted these policies. While a proportion of non-champion groups employ all types of policies,\nnational champions employ a higher proportion across the board. For example, 40% of the national\nchampion groups had finance companies, compared to only 11% for other groups; 84% had\nresearch and technology centres compared with 55% for other non-trial groups. Both Nolan (2001)\nand Keister (1998) make the point that these groups are among the most advanced business groups\nin China. As such they are arguably in the best possible position to substitute for the imperfect\nmarkets that business groups supposedly replace.\nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE\nThe national champions, moreover, are very large both in absolute size and relative to other\ngroups. When including the parent company (in China referred to as mother company, \u2018mu gongsi\u2019,\nor \u2018group company\u2019) and subsidiaries with an ownership stake in excess of 50%, the total aggregate\nassets, for example, summed to US$715bn in 2003, representing an average of US$6.3bn per\ngroup. In contrast, the 2,579 other enterprise groups were much smaller in average size (US$517m)\n5(Table 2). Similar differences exist in terms of turnover and number of employees. Remarkably,\nboth national champions and other groups experienced high annual growth, at or above 18% each\nyear in assets and sales, around twice the speed of national output growth. Employee growth is\nlower but clearly contrary to the general trend of downsizing within state industry (falling from 55\nmillion in 1992 to 29 million in 2002, for example, in the manufacturing sector (SSB, 2005,\np.126)). The trial groups employed around 80,000 per group, compared to 6,000 for non trial\ngroups. Percentage growth rates in assets, turnover and employees are lower for national\nchampions than for other groups, although the absolute growth is much higher.1 Between 1997 and\n2003, R&D expenditure within the national team increased at an average 30% growth rate\ncompared to 21% for other groups, whilst R&D\/turnover increased from 9.9% to 14% compared to\na decrease from 13.4% to 10.9% for other groups. The exports of the trial groups increased from\nUS$9bn to US$23.9bn between 1997-2003 (an average increase of 19.5%).This is similar to the\nincrease observed for other groups. The exports of the national champion groups and the other\nenterprise groups accounted for 21% of the total value of all China\u2019s exports in 2003, an increase\nfrom 17% in 1997 (SSB 2004b).\nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE\nFinally, the number and type of firms participating within China\u2019s business groups has also\ngrown. Official data on Chinese business groups records a variety of data on the mother company\nand the first tier of subsidiaries. The total number of first tier subsidiaries increased from 24,523 to\n27,950 between 2002 and 2006. Their share of the total assets of the business groups also increased\nfrom 56% to 66% (SSB, 2003; SSB, 2007). Among these subsidiaries, moreover, firms registered\nas state owned became less important as a corporatisation process ensued. An increase in the\nnumber and share of limited liability companies (increasing from 9% to 15% in terms of asset\nshare) and larger stock limited companies, those potentially listed on China\u2019s stock exchanges, took\nplace (increasing from 10% to 20% in terms of asset share) (SSB, 2003a; SSBa, 2007). As such the\nnature and ownership structure of China\u2019s business groups, at least at the level of the first tier,\nappeared to be becoming more diversified. Within the mother company, furthermore, those in\nwhich the controlling shareholder was registered as state or collective entity decreased from 100%\nto around 47% between 1997 and 2006, while the number of privately controlled groups increased\nto 38% (SSB, 2007a, p. 17). For national champion trial groups, however, nearly all remained state\ncontrolled, with the exception of two private and two collective groups.\n2.2 Research questions\nThe trial national champion business groups are the largest and most advanced groups in China,\nbenefiting from a raft of experimental changes. Their characteristic features, moreover, have been\nshown in other contexts to benefit group members. Keister (1998, 2000), for example, shows that\nthe presence of group finance companies benefits subsidiaries. If group membership in China is\nbeneficial therefore, arguably the firms most likely to benefit are the subsidiaries of national\nchampions. On the other hand, however, the greater degree of state ownership within the mother\n1 For example, the average asset size for the national champions in 1997 is US$2.3bn compared to US$6.3bn\nin 2003, whilst other enterprise groups increase from an average size of US$145m in 1997 to US$517m in\n2003.\n6company, some argue, may encourage the tunnelling of assets away from subsidiary firms (World\nBank, 2005). Given these two apparent contradictory forces, as well as the declared policy to create\ninternationally competitive groups, it is of particular interest to further investigate the performance\nof the national champion subsidiaries involved in the trials to create business groups.\nIn the next section we describe the methodology and data we employ to examine how these\nsubsidiaries perform relative to other firms.\n3. Methodology and Data\nThe methodological approach we employ to test whether affiliation to national champion\nbusiness groups is beneficial is to examine how listed subsidiaries of national champion business\ngroups perform compared to other listed firms. The examination of group affiliated listed\nsubsidiaries is the approach used by the majority of empirical studies (see e.g., Hoshi et al., 1991;\nChoi and Cowing, 1999). We focus on listed firms (rather than private firms) because of the more\nreliable accounting data and additional share price measures available. If group affiliation improves\nperformance, we expect national champion listed affiliates to outperform all other listed firms\nincluding both listed subsidiaries of other business (non-national champion) groups and\nindependent listed firms. Again, previous studies have also employed this approach, focusing on\nwhether listed firms are members or not of only the largest business groups (Choi and Cowing,\n1999). Unfortunately, it is not possible to compare the performance of member firms before and\nafter their affiliation to national champion groups because it is hard to estimate precisely when\nparticular groups became national champions,2 and because listing of group subsidiaries often\nfollowed selection of the parent group as a national champion. Our approach therefore, along with\nprior studies, is prone to selection bias and a potential endogeneity problem (Khanna, 2000).\nIn order to identify listed subsidiaries of national champion groups we use the Osiris database to\nexamine whether the largest shareholder in all Chinese listed companies (as of year end 2004) is a\nnational champion parent group. If it is, then we use the Osiris company history to establish\nwhether the listed subsidiaries have been subsidiaries of the national team member groups since\ntheir initial listing. If so, they are included in the analysis. Of the 1,503 listed Chinese firms on\nOsiris, we identified 87 as being subsidiaries of national champions. We collect financial\naccounting data from Osiris and stock market data from Datastream, both of which date from 1998-\n2004. In order to be included in the analysis, companies must be listed on both databases and have\nthe financial variables required for the analysis (described below). This results in a final sample of\n69 national champion subsidiary listed firms and 983 other listed Chinese firms. The annual data\navailability for these two sets of firms is reported in Table 3 below.\nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE\n3.1 Performance measures and specification\nWe examine the impact of national champion affiliation on three different performance\nvariables; profitability, Tobin\u2019s Q, and share return. Profitability is the ratio of profit before interest\nand taxation divided by net assets. Tobin\u2019s Q is book value of total assets plus market value of\nequity minus book value of equity divided by book value of total assets. Share return is the\n2 This is because of the at times informal and experimental nature of the national champion policy. For\nexample, experiments with three large auto makers started in 1986 but the formal announcement of the first\nbatch of trial groups did not take place until 1991.\n7logarithmic annual share return between 1st January and 31st December, and takes account of both\ndividends and stock splits (Datastream variable RI). Previous studies have tended to use either one\nor more of these three measures of performance. We employ all three to ensure that our results are\nrobust to different firm performance measures. The specific econometric regression that we run is\nas follows:\nPerformance indicator = \u03b1 + \u03b21 National champion + \u03b22 Size + \u03b23 Age + \u03b24 Growth +\n\u03b25 Debt + Industry dummies + Year dummies + \u03b5 (1)\nNational champion is a dummy variable which is set equal to one for firms that are national\nteam subsidiaries and zero for firms which are not. The coefficient for this dummy variable\nmeasures the difference in the performance measure between the 69 national champion subsidiary\nfirms and the other 983 firms. Size is the logarithm of the book value of total assets at the beginning\nof the year, which is adjusted for inflation by converting into 2004 real terms using the Chinese\nConsumer Price Index (OECD Factbook 2006). Age is the logarithm of the number of years since\nthe firm was first listed on Datastream. Growth is the annual percentage growth rate in real sales.\nDebt is long term debt divided by the sum of shareholder funds and long term debt. Industry\ndummies are industry dummy variables which are set equal to one for each US SIC two digit code,\nwhilst Year dummies are year dummy variables. These independent variables are designed to\ncontrol for factors that may both determine our dependent variables and differ between group\naffiliated firms and other listed firms.3 We employ ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and\nHuber-White (1980) robust standard errors. All variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th\npercentiles to remove influential outliers. Table 4 below reports descriptive statistics for the\nsample.\nINSERT TABLE 4 HERE\n4. Results\nThe results of the regression models are reported in Table 5 below. The coefficient for the\nnational champion dummy variable is positive and statistically significant (at the five percent level\nor higher) in each of the three regressions. This evidence suggests that listed subsidiaries of\nnational champion groups have significantly higher profitability, Tobin\u2019s Q, and share returns than\nother listed firms, after controlling for size, age, growth, leverage, industry and year fixed effects.\nThe results suggest that these differences are economically as well as statistically significant. In\nthe profitability regression (column 1), the coefficient for the national champion dummy variable is\n0.012, suggesting that national champion subsidiaries exhibit a profit rate some 0.012 higher than\nother firms. Given that the average profit rate for the overall sample is 0.0599 (see Table 4), the\nprofit rate for national champion subsidiaries is some 20% higher. Similarly, for the Tobin\u2019s Q\nregression, the national champion coefficient is 0.156, which compared to an average sample\nTobin\u2019s Q of 1.9525, suggests that national champion subsidiaries exhibit a Tobin\u2019s Q which is 8%\nhigher than other firms. Finally, for the share return regression, the national champion coefficient is\n0.038 compared to an average sample share return of -0.0689, which is again an economically\nmeaningful difference.\nINSERT TABLE 5 HERE\n3 In untabulated univariate tests we find that, compared to other listed firms, national champion listed\nsubsidiaries are significantly larger, but have similar age, growth, and debt.\n8Our key result from this section is that listed subsidiaries of national champion groups have\nsignificantly higher performance than other listed firms. We now subject this finding to a number\nof robustness tests.\n4.1 Tests of robustness\nFirstly, we test the robustness of our results to alternative definitions of the performance measures\nused for our dependent variables. Instead of profitability before interest and taxation over net\nassets, we employ net income divided by shareholders funds. Instead of Tobin\u2019s Q we employ\nmarket value of equity divided by shareholder funds, and instead of using the logarithm annual\nshare return we use the arithmetic annual return. None of these alternative definitions makes a\ndifference to the results in Table 5. The coefficient for the national champion dummy is\nsignificantly positive in each case.\nSecondly, we test the robustness of our findings to the inclusion of additional control variables.\nOur sample of 1,052 firms have their main listing on different stock markets (604 in Shanghai, 423\nin Shenzhen, 23 in Hong Kong, and 2 in Singapore). We control for these differences by including\ndummy variables for the different stock markets. We control for the level of firm diversification by\nincluding a dummy variable set equal to one if the primary and secondary 2-digit SIC codes are\ndifferent from one another. We include a number of additional financial variables as explanatory\nvariables in each regression (intangible assets divided by total assets, current ratio, dividend payout\nratio, profitability variance). In all cases, the positive impact of national champion affiliation\nremains significantly positive. The positive impact of national champion affiliation on profitability\nand share return is not sensitive to exclusion of any or all of the independent variables in Table 5,\nalthough the positive impact on Tobin\u2019s Q does not hold if firm size is not controlled for.\nA third robustness test concerns the benchmark for our national champion listed firms. In Table\n5 we compared them with all other listed firms. We are able to refine this counterfactual to some\nextent by classifying sample firms according to their largest shareholder. Osiris reports the largest\nshareholder (for 2004) according to whether it is an industrial firm (841), government agency (93),\nfinancial company (80), individual or family (3), or no large shareholder (35). Firstly, we restrict\nthe sample to either national champion subsidiaries or those whose largest shareholder is a\ngovernment agency (93). Since the latter are state owned but not group affiliated, this allows us to\ntest whether group affiliation has a positive impact on performance for state owned listed firms.\nThe regressions for this subsample show that the coefficient for the national champion coefficient\nis significantly positive for profitability and share return although insignificantly positive for\nTobin\u2019s Q. Secondly we compare national champion subsidiaries with those firms whose largest\nshareholder is an industrial firm (841). This comparison allows us to examine whether affiliation to\nnational champion groups is more beneficial than affiliation to other groups (state owned or non-\nstate owned groups). 4 Regressions carried out on this restricted sample show that the coefficient\nfor the national champion dummy variable continues to be significantly positive for the Tobin\u2019s Q\nand share return regressions although insignificantly positive for the profitability regression.\nOverall, these two tests show that national champion affiliation is beneficial compared to both\ndirect state ownership and to affiliation to other groups (state owned or non-state owned groups).\nIn summary, the results in this section show that firms that are affiliated with the national\nchampion groups have higher performance. This finding is robust, holding across a range of\nperformance measures, control variables, and benchmark firms. This is consistent with previous\n4 We are unable to distinguish between those industrial firms that are state owned and those that are not.\n9empirical studies on China which show that group affiliation is associated with positive\nperformance impacts (Keister, 1998; Ma et al., 2006).\n5. Summary and Discussion\nWe have identified China\u2019s most important business groups (the 100 plus \u2018national champion\u2019\ntrial groups) and investigated the performance of their listed subsidiaries. A sustained government\npolicy over the past 20 years has bestowed upon these groups a wide range of group rights, some of\nwhich have been shown to be associated with successful business group performance in other\nsettings. The government\u2019s objective is to make these groups internationally competitive.\nAggregate data on the groups (including mother and first tier subsidiaries) suggests that, as a\nwhole, these groups are very large and have grown quickly in terms of sales, assets and R&D\nexpenditures. Going a step further we apply a frequently used approach in the business group\nliterature to examine subsidiary performance (Khanna and Yafeh, 2007). Our analysis of the listed\nsubsidiaries of these national champions shows that they outperform non-affiliates in terms of\nhigher profitability, stock market valuations and share returns.\nOne interpretation is that institutional changes in the national champion groups are responsible\nfor the observed high performance in member subsidiaries. This argument is consistent with\nprevious studies which find that certain institutional features more prevalent in China\u2019s largest\ngroups (such as finance companies and research and development centres) directly improve\nmember performance (Keister, 1998, 2000). Other studies, moreover, concentrating specifically on\nChina\u2019s groups, also give reasons as to why groups may provide benefits to member firms. Nolan\nand Wang (1999), for example, have suggested on the basis of numerous case studies that Chinese\ngroups may pool and distribute heterogeneous resources for member firms (such as management\nskills, brands, sales and marketing). It has also been suggested that group membership may provide\ninsulation from potential or real political intervention, thus controlling an uncertain political\nenvironment while \u2018improving their access to scarce goods\u2019 (Keister, 2000, p. 151). Moving\nbeyond studies of Chinese business groups, studies in other regions of the world also list numerous\ncredible reasons as to why business groups may enhance firm-level performance, a major one being\nthe presence of imperfect markets (Khanna and Yafeh 2007). It is entirely conceivable, of course,\nthat Chinese groups do substitute for missing markets, hence leading to lower transactions costs.\nSuch missing markets are particularly severe in transition economies (Keister, 1998). In other\nwords, in the Chinese context it is possible that business groups are \u2018paragons\u2019 as opposed to\nparasites. Indeed, the only other study with direct similarities to ours, looking at listed subsidiaries\nof groups, finds evidence that they may improve subsidiary performance (Ma et al 2006). Smyth\n(2000), in a synthesis of current arguments, also concludes that groups may be beneficial to firm\nperformance in China. On balance then, there are many reasons and considerable evidence for\nbelieving that business groups may improve firm performance in the Chinese context. Indeed, the\nsheer proliferation of such groups, both state owned and private, would seem to suggest they may\nenjoy some competitive advantages.\nThis said, as with other studies in this area, it is important to stress that this interpretation of our\nresults is tentative, because the methodology does not establish causality. The results could instead\nequally well be explained by national champion groups listing well performing firms, or policy\nmakers successfully \u2018picking winners\u2019. In addressing whether performance has been better for\nnational champions, moreover, it is impossible to take into account whether there are direct\ninterventions that may lead to better performance among these listed subsidiaries (preferential\n10\naccess to material supplies, finance, foreign investment, public procurement and the like) or what\nthe opportunity costs of these interventions are. Clearly, more research is needed to further clarify\nthese issues. Still, it is some interest that the very subsidiaries which have been hypothesised to be\nmost at risk of agency problems and tunneling do not seem to be performing badly, but instead very\nwell. The World Bank (2005), for example, highlighted concerns about the capacity and\nwillingness of state groups to exploit their listed subsidiaries. Clearly, our results suggest this is not\nthe case. Instead, the trend appears more consistent with the goal of creating internationally\ncompetitive transnational businesses, one avowed goal of the policy (Nolan 2001).\nIn highlighting China\u2019s business groups as an area of research we believe there are a number of\npoints that warrant mention and further investigation. Firstly, moving beyond the question of the\nperformance of firms affiliated to China\u2019s trial business groups, we note that the influence of\nChina\u2019s groups now arguably extends the reach of China\u2019s state sector beyond the traditional\nboundaries marked by standard ownership criteria. We have already noted that there were 2,856\nofficially recognized business groups with over 27,950 first-tier subsidiaries (averaging about 10\nper group in which the ownership stake exceeded 50%) by the end of 2006. But how large are\nChina\u2019s business groups if we include lower tiers of member firms? Delineating the exact\nboundaries of business groups is notoriously difficult. Different and at times quite vague definitions\nof what actually constitutes a group, and by extension group membership, exist. Granovetter, in a\nseminal contribution, notes how groups have an \u2018invisible nature\u2019 (Granovetter 1993, p. 97). Thus\npractical definitions of business groups are nearly always subjective and vary considerably across\ncountries. In post-war Japan\u2019s case, for example, Khanna and Yafeh (2007) define group\nmembership as those firms which send members to the meetings of the \u2018Presidents Clubs\u2019. The\nKorea Fair Trade Commission, on the other hand, defines a business group as \u2018a group of\ncompanies of which more than 30 percent of shares are owned by the group\u2019s controlling\nshareholder and its affiliated companies\u2019 (the average number of affiliated firms within the\nchaebols was 27 in 1998) (Bae and Jeong 2007, p.743). Other academics provide rather broad\ndefinitions which are quite hard to apply (take Leff\u2019s early definition, for example: \u2018a group of\ncompanies that does business in different markets under a common administrative or financial\ncontrol\u2019 and that are \u2018linked by relations interpersonal trust, on the basis of a similar personal,\nethnic or commercial background\u2019 (Leff, 1978, p. 663). In short, there is considerable debate on\njust how business groups should be defined (are social ties, for example, more important than\nownership ties?). The official Chinese definition of group membership, however, in including data\non first tier subsidiaries, arguably means China\u2019s groups appear small in terms of actual\nmembership numbers. If, however, second and lower tier companies are included, China\u2019s groups\nwould almost certainly appear considerably larger. The influence of China\u2019s business groups,\ntherefore, is almost certainly greater than the already significant scale and reach highlighted by\nofficial statistics. Given this, the performance impacts of group affiliation are clearly important to\nunderstand.\nSecondly, related to this point and also the important issue of affiliate ownership and control, is\nthe question of why business groups, often with controlling shareholders rather than free-standing\nlarge enterprises with diffuse ownership, are becoming dominant in the Chinese economy. It is\nimportant to note, in this regard, that it has recently been shown that it is only in the UK and US\nthat the free-standing diffuse ownership pattern of corporate governance structure truly exists (La\nPorta et al, 1999). In this sense the evolution of China\u2019s current business group structures, in which\nsome firms may come to control numerous other firms (both publicly listed and non-listed), is not\nso surprising. In most countries (both developing and developed) large corporations often have\n11\ncontrolling owners (usually wealthy families) and also pyramidal type control structures using\nbusiness groups. One feature of these ownership structures is that they may allow the controlling\nfamily, or state body in China\u2019s case, to vastly expand their control over firms and the economy as\na whole \u2018without undertaking commensurate capital investments\u2019 (Morck et al 2005, p. 655).\nIndeed, one rationale for business groups, considered also to cause agency problems, is that they\nallow firms to attract large volumes of external capital while maintaining ultimate control over firm\nmembers. Raising capital through the creation of business groups has arguably been especially\nappealing to incumbent state bodies at different levels in China (provincial and city governments,\nfor example). Business groups, therefore, provide attractive possibilities to leverage the influence\nof state actors, thus facilitating control over large parts of the economy. This phenomenon,\nwhereby elites control vast swathes of an economy through business groups, has been referred to as\n\u2018economic entrenchment\u2019 (Morck et al 2005). It is also considered to be significant in\nunderstanding economic performance across countries.\nThirdly, and following from the points above, as business groups absorb more firms and in turn\ncapital from different sources this leads to the diversification of ownership within business groups.\nThis raises numerous interesting questions about the role such groups play in ownership reform and\nthe boundaries of the traditional state owned economy in China. Much of the discussion, dating\nfrom the debate of transition strategies (\u2018gradualism\u2019 versus \u2018big bang\u2019 approaches) has dwelt upon\nthe issue of ownership and how this may impact on firm performance. Business groups, however,\nmay play an important role in blurring clear ownership boundaries. This is because they may allow\na state-owned parent company, through pyramidal type control chains, to control other non-state\nfirms. Liu and Pei (2005), for example, highlight what they believe to be the prevalence of such\ncontrol chains and the difficulty this presents in specifying the ultimate owner of listed firms. They\nnote, furthermore, that many firms officially designated as being non-state owned are in many\ninstances actually ultimately controlled by state owned business groups. The true extent of such\ncontrol chains and the role business groups play in expanding their control over the non-state sector\nis an important question and warrants greater research. By 2006, for example, only 5,493 of the\n27,950 first tier subsidiaries in China\u2019s business groups remained registered as state owned. Over\n14,000, by contrast, had been transformed into limited liability and 1,882 into stock holding\ncompanies, opening up the way for ownership diversification and, arguably, the extension of the\ncontrol of elite state groups over non-state subsidiaries.\n6. Conclusion\nThe primary purpose of this paper was to investigate the performance of the listed subsidiaries\nof China\u2019s trial business groups. Given the outstanding features of these groups, including their\ngreater institutional development, higher concentration of state ownership among the mother\ncompany and their centrality to Chinese industrial policies (to create internationally competitive\nbusiness groups), it is of particular interest to investigate their performance. Our results are\nsurprising, in so far as a clear tendency to outperform other listed firms was found. We have\ndiscussed possible interpretations for this and conclude that it appears consistent with the research\nto date on China\u2019s business groups.\nTo conclude, it is important to frame our findings within a broader context. The transition\northodoxy, a paradigm strongly influenced by the ideas of mainstream neoclassical economics,\ncalled for the rapid privatisation of large state owned enterprises, rapid liberalisation and close\nintegration with international markets. It also emphasised the importance of small private\nenterprises in promoting economic growth and the impossibility of turning round state owned\nenterprises (World Bank, 2002). The success of China\u2019s economic reforms, therefore, has been\n12\ndescribed by recourse to the analogy of \u2018a dry prairie, parched by years of planning, awaiting the\nsprinklings of market reform\u2019 (World Bank, 1997). In this analogy, success was attributable solely\nto the \u2018shoots\u2019 of small private enterprises emerging in response to market forces. In so far as it\nenvisaged large enterprises taking a centre stage in economic development, it did so with reference\nto the type of structures noted in the advanced capitalist economies, particularly the US and Britain\n(i.e. free standing firms with diffuse ownership). This might be applicable to US or British firms,\nwhich are generally, if not always, freestanding. Recent research, however, shows these types of\ngovernance structures are highly atypical (La Porta et al, 1999). It is, in fact, more common,\nparticularly for large listed corporations, to belong to business groups, often in a pyramidal form,\nwith an identifiable controlling owner (as opposed to many small shareholders). Such structures\nmay also, and often do, allow small elites to control vast swathes of the corporate sector. The\ncomplex types of ownership and control structures that actually predominate throughout the real\nworld, and the important role of business groups, particularly in developing countries with\nimperfect markets, was therefore largely overlooked by this orthodox view. Here we have\nhighlighted the importance of these large groups and the need to further deepen our study of them.\n13\nBibliography\nBae, K. H., Jeong, S. W. 2007.

Tobin\u2019s Q is book value of total assets plus\nmarket value of equity minus book value of equity divided by book value of total assets. Share return is the\nlogarithm of the annual buy-and-hold share return between 1st January and 31st December, and takes account\nof both dividends and stock splits Size is the logarithm of the book value of total assets at the beginning of\nthe year, which is adjusted for inflation by converting into 2004 real terms using the Chinese Consumer Price\nIndex (OECD Factbook 2006). Age is the logarithm of the number of years since the firm was first listed on\nDatastream. Growth is the annual percentage growth rate in real sales. Debt is long term debt divided by the\nsum of shareholder funds and long term debt. All variables have been winsorized at the 1st and 99th\npercentiles to remove influential outliers.\n19\nTable 5.
