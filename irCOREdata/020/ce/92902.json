Using a simple model of voting behaviour, where\nparty affiliation serves as a partial intervening variable between constituency interests and\nlegislative votes on trade policy, I test hypotheses derived from three different interpretations of\nthe \u2018marriage of iron and rye\u2019. Roll-call votes from four key divisions in the Reichstag are\nanalysed in a number of forms, ranging from cross-tabulations to conditional logistic regression.\nRonald Rogowksi\u2019s \u2018factor endowment\u2019 model offers an important dynamic perspective that is\nlacking in the others, but his model must be reconciled with anomalies that arise in the short run.\nRather than attempting to disentangle political party ideology from constituents\u2019 interests, more\ninsight may be gained from understanding why the effects of the two causal factors were not fixed,\nand how they varied over time.\nPerhaps one of the most studied coalitions of diverse economic interests is\nGermany\u2019s \u2018marriage of iron and rye\u2019, in which heavy industry and the large\nagricultural estate owners of east Elbian Prussia (the Junkers) coalesced around\na tariff policy for both industrial and agricultural imports. Two parallel events\n\u2013 the Great Depression (c.1873\u2013c.1896) and a rapid growth in foreign grain\nimports in the mid-1870s \u2013 created economic insecurity for the coal and steel\ninterests and the grain-producing landed estates, respectively. The shift to\nprotection with the Tariff Law of 1879 cemented an alliance which for some\ncommentators continued through the first decade of the twentieth century. This\narticle examines the \u2018marriage\u2019 with two purposes. First, three interests-based\ninterpretations are presented: (1) a compromise between unequals, in which the\nJunkers asserted their authoritarian influence over the politically backward\nindustrialists; (2) a recurring convergence of interests, driven and punctuated\nby conflict between classes, religions, industries and regions; and (3) a coalition\nof owners of scarce factors of production, joined and separated by structural\n* Comments on a previous version of this article from Andrew Bailey, Jim Cassing, Jeffrey\nFrieden, Carsten Hefeker, Arye Hillman, Stephanie Hoopes, Adam Klug, Rainer Klump, Achim\nKo\u00a8rber, David Lake, Timothy McKeown, Robert Pahre, Ronald Rogowski, and audiences at the\nSilvaplana Workshop on Political Economy, University of Wu\u00a8rzburg, Nuffield College, Oxford, and\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, are very much appreciated.

I\nassess the strengths and weaknesses of the interpretations by analysing\nstatistically the relationships between constituency interests and the party\naffiliation of their representatives, and then the combined effects of party\naffiliation and constituency interests on voting behaviour in the Reichstag.\nBecause advanced statistical analysis of four historic divisions associated with\nthe marriage \u2013 the 1879 Tariff Law, the 1893 Romanian Treaty, the 1894\nRussian Treaty, and the 1902 Tariff Law \u2013 is unprecedented (as far as I know),\nthis study provides a first step towards formally testing some of the contradictory\ninterpretations of this important coalition. The findings suggest that economic\ninterests, shaped by changes in Germany\u2019s relative factor endowment,\nadequately capture the long-run dimension of the marriage, but in the short run,\npolitical\u2013ideological factors cannot be ignored.\nA second purpose of this article is to contribute a historical perspective to the\n\u2018ideology versus interests\u2019 debate in the literature on legislative behaviour. It\nis generally accepted that the 1879 tariff marked a watershed in Imperial German\npolitics: \u2018It signified the disappearance of parties grounded upon political\nprinciple and ushered in a new era, in which parties were to act as the agents\nof specific economic interests\u2019.2 Political party ideology, it is argued, gave way\nto pressure group politics. Statistical analysis of roll-call votes on trade policy\nin the Reichstag provides a useful, if difficult, test of this proposition. Recent\nwork highlights serious difficulties in attempting to disentangle empirically the\nrelative effects of ideology and economic interests on roll-call votes.3 As yet no\ngeneral agreement exists on the \u2018proper\u2019 method for measuring the effects of\nconstituents\u2019 ideological predispositions, their economic interests, and the\nideological predispositions of representatives (and how this translates into party\naffiliation). Rather than attempting to disentangle ideology from interests, the\nstrategy adopted here is to examine the overlap between these two causal agents.\n1 Elsewhere I examine a fourth \u2018statist\u2019 interpretation (\u2018Sorting the Wheat from the Chaff: The\n\u201cMarriage of Iron and Rye\u201d Revisited\u2019, unpublished working paper, London School of Economics\nand Political Science, 1994).\n2 Dan S.

Reductions in iron\nand steel tariffs (1873) and the complete abolition of the pig iron tariff in 1877\nhelped to mobilize heavy industry against Germany\u2019s free-trade orientation.\nGrain producers and heavy industrialists, up to then suspicious adversaries,\nconverged upon a common interest in protectionism. The tariff of 1879 enacted\nthis policy shift into legislation.\nIn the 1880s there were two further increases in agricultural tariffs, while\nindustrial tariffs remained virtually constant.6 By the early 1890s, real and\npotential retaliation from Germany\u2019s trading partners convinced German\nindustry of the need to take measures to regain (and expand) export markets.\nBetween 1891 and 1894, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck\u2019s successor, Leo von\nCaprivi, negotiated numerous foreign trade agreements that effectively\nexchanged lower German tariffs on agriculture for reductions in foreign tariffs\non German industrial goods. As Caprivi\u2019s treaties approached their expiration,\nChancellor Bernhard von Bu\u00a8low introduced the \u2018general tariff\u2019 in 1902, thereby\nsignalling a resumption of high agricultural tariffs.7\nIn brief, the years 1879, 1891\u201394 and 1902 exhibit policy shifts from free\ntrade to protection, to freer trade, then back to protection. The next section,\nwhich tests competing interpretations of the marriage, analyses Reichstag\ndeputies\u2019 roll-call votes for four divisions\u2014two motions for higher tariffs (the\n1879 and 1902 autonomous Tariff Laws) and two for lower tariffs (the 1893\nRomanian and the 1894 Russian trade treaties).

Both the\nagricultural and industrial lobbies considered the 1893 Romanian Treaty to be\nthe most important of the \u2018small treaties\u2019 negotiated by Caprivi (with Romania,\nSpain and Serbia).8 For the iron and textile manufacturers, exports to Romania\nwere estimated at 100 million marks, whereas Spanish exports were 40\u201350\nmillion and Serbian only several million. In contrast, Romania provided about\n10 per cent of Germany\u2019s wheat imports and about 7 per cent of rye imports.\nSince Romania imposed no tariff on Russian grain imports, the agrarians feared\nthat lower tariffs on Romanian grain would lead to a \u2018flood\u2019 of Russian rye into\nGermany.9 The 1894 Russian Treaty was also crucial to both lobbies. Ten years\nof poor trade relations between Russia and Germany had culminated in a trade\nwar in the early 1890s, precipitating fears \u2018that an actual war might result if a\nbetter understanding was not achieved at once\u2019.10 Heavy industrialists lobbied\nhard for passage of the treaty, while the agrarians lobbied forcefully against it.\nThe agrarians were particularly sensitive since Russia was by far Germany\u2019s\nleading supplier of grain, providing 31 per cent of wheat imports and 67 per cent\nof rye imports in the early 1890s.11\nThe Marriage as a Compromise\nStudies of democratic theory and the political economy of development have\npointed to this coalition of landowners and industrialists as illustrative of the\nauthoritarian path to development particularly evident among late industrializ-\ners which have experienced no revolutionary break from the past. Prominent\nworks \u2013 which, together, constitute the \u2018traditional\u2019 interpretation \u2013 have\nportrayed the coalition as a partnership of a politically dominant agrarian elite\nand a politically weak, underdeveloped bourgeoisie against a rising proletar-\niat.12 The bourgeoisie is said to have accepted the political, social and\n8 Tirrell, German Agrarian Politics After Bismarck\u2019s Fall, pp. 207\u201347.\n9 Tirrell, German Agrarian Politics After Bismarck\u2019s Fall, pp. 21, 226\u20137.\n10 Tirrell, German Agrarian Politics After Bismarck\u2019s Fall, p. 254. Russian duties were increased\nseven times between 1881 and 1890, resulting in a large drop in German exports to Russia. In 1891,\nRussian imports to Germany were subjected to a 50 per cent tariff, while a similar tariff was placed\non German imports to Russia (pp. 82\u20133, 253).\n11 Tirrell, German Agrarian Politics After Bismarck\u2019s Fall, p. 21.\n12 Alexander Gerschenkron, Bread and Democracy in Germany (Berkeley: University of\nCalifornia Press, 1943); and Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective (Cambridge, Mass.:\nHarvard University Press, 1962); Barrington Moore Jr, Social Origins of Dictatorship and\nDemocracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press,\n1966); Eckart Kehr (ed. and trans. by Pauline R.

In short, German industrialists of the nineteenth century \u2018failed\nto develop a sufficiently strong liberal constitutionalist backbone\u2019 \u2013 a handicap\nthat plagued German political development until 1945.13\nYet, underpinning this partnership of unequals were raw economic interests\n\u2013 particularly those of the Junkers. The traditional interpretation maintains that\nas the Junkers began to fear lower prices from foreign grain imports, they\nreversed their support for free trade in agriculture14 and pushed for protection\nfor German agriculture.15 \u2018For industry as a whole\u2019, Gerschenkron notes,\n\u2018agricultural tariffs meant labour pressure for increased wages, retardation in the\nflow of labour supply from agricultural districts, \u2026 and danger of retaliation on\nthe part of countries which supplied wide markets for the products of German\nindustry\u2019.16 But for heavy industry, reciprocal tariffs on iron and steel\nmanufactures constituted \u2018more than\u2019 sufficient compensation, since these\ntariffs created \u2018a monopolistic position in the domestic market\u2019.17 Ideally,\nindustrialists would have preferred industrial tariffs without agricultural\nprotection, but since the landowners held veto power, they learned that this was\nnot possible.18\nAgricultural tariffs perpetuated feudalism, allowing the Junkers to benefit\nfrom protection, whereas smaller farmers and peasants, as producers primarily\nof livestock (and therefore consumers of grain for feed), suffered. Traditionalists\nhave some difficulty explaining why smaller farmers and peasants generally\nsupported agricultural protection, except to lament that they were duped into\nbelieving that the large landowners were spokesmen for the whole of\nagriculture.19 More recently, some historians have given more credit to the\nrationality of peasants, arguing that they gained from restrictions on the import\n(F\u2019note continued)\nRecent Studies in Agricultural History (Winchester, Hants: Allen & Unwin, 1986); Dietrich\nRueschemeyer, Evelyne Huber Stephens and John D.

Whereas \u2018old\u2019 German conser-\nvatism was ideological in orientation, new conservatism (organized in 1876 as\nthe Deutsch-Konservative Partei) sought to represent the economic interests of\nthe land-owning aristocracy.22 By the early 1890s, in response to the threat of\nthe Caprivi trade reforms, militant Prussian landowners created a modern\ninterest group, the Farmers\u2019 League (Bund der Landwirte). Rather than\ncompeting with the Conservative party, the League strengthened and reformed\nit by broadening the electoral support base for conservatism, particularly among\nthe smaller proprietors and lower-middle classes. The League appealed to\nsmaller farmers with a new ideology of vo\u00a8lkisch nationalism,23 thereby\nenveloping the protectionist interests of the Prussian landowners into a more\nnational conservative movement.\nIn sum, the traditional compromise interpretation of the marriage emphasizes:\n(1) the shift in the late 1870s towards support for protection by the landowning\nelite and the agrarian population as a whole; and (2) the role of the Conservative\nparty as the \u2018mouthpiece\u2019 of the agrarian interest. These two characteristics\nhighlight the traditional interpretation\u2019s predominant concern with agrarian\nunity, which was defined by the economic interests of the import-competing\ngrain-producers and was carried into the political arena by the Conservative\nparty. As a testable hypothesis,\nHYPOTHESIS 1: Agrarian unity should be reflected in (a) agrarian regions voting\npredominantly for Conservative party representatives; and (b)\ndeputies from agrarian regions voting for agricultural protection in\nthe Reichstag.\nMoreover,\nHYPOTHESIS 2: Conservative party delegates in the Reichstag should consistently\nand uniformly support high agricultural tariffs.\n20 James C.

Some authors stress the political ramifications of divisions within\nGerman industry (heavy versus light, new versus old, cartelized versus\nnon-cartelized, and efficient versus inefficient producers).24 Others emphasize\nthe cultural separatism of German Catholicism (including, but not limited to the\nduration of the Kulturkampf) or the hysteria of anti-socialism.25 Economic and\nsocial divisions were further complicated by German federalism, which gave\nrise to conflicts between the local and national governments, as well as between\nregions.26\nI focus on one key area of conflict, namely intra-industry conflict between\nlight (usually non-cartelized) industry and heavy (cartelized) industry. Several\nrevisionists, who fault the traditionalists for overstating the cohesiveness of\nGerman industry, maintain that on tariffs it split into opposing factions. The less\nconcentrated sectors of the light and consumer-goods industries (leather-\nworking, textiles, woodworking) were forced to pay higher prices for\ntariff-protected raw materials controlled by the cartelized heavy industries and\nthe agricultural sector.27 In 1895, these industries launched a counter-movement\nto the Centralverband deutscher Industriellen (CVDI),28 the Bund der\nIndustriellen (BdI), thereby creating a conspicuous dichotomy between the\n24 Abraham, The Collapse of the Weimar Republic; Blackbourn, \u2018The Discreet Charm of the\nBourgeoisie\u2019; David Calleo, The German Problem Reconsidered: Germany and the World Order,\n1870 to the Present (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978); Eley, \u2018The British Model and\nthe German Road\u2019; Peter Gourevitch, Politics in Hard Times: Comparative Responses to\nInternational Economic Crises (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1986); Lambi, Free Trade and\nProtection in Germany; James J.

The BdI was the first major\norganization to represent the liberal, free-trade-in-agriculture interests of\nGerman light industry, although other organizations soon followed \u2013 the Central\nOffice for the Preparation of Commercial Treaties in 1897, the Association for\nCommercial Treaties in 1900, and finally the explicitly anti-agrarian Hansabund\n(Hanse Union) in 1909.\nThe schism between light and heavy industry became manifest in (1) class\nconflict, (2) regional conflict and (3) the splintering of political parties. First,\nlight industries were more exposed to labour\u2019s demands since they lacked the\nmonopoly power to enact a \u2018self-help\u2019 system of company paternalism.29 They\nresorted both to appeals to the state for legislation on managing labour relations,\nand to ad hoc firm-by-firm wage agreements. As a consequence, the Free Trade\nUnions (whose national membership grew from 222,697 in 1896 to 1,446,529\nin 1906)30 became deeply embedded in the less concentrated industries and\nmade virtually no inroads into the coal, iron, steel, chemicals and heavy\nmachinery industries.31\nSecondly, conflicts between light and heavy industries reflected a tension\nbetween old and new industrial regions, with the former concentrated in Saxony\nand the latter in the Ruhr. Industry in Saxony, consisting of mostly small\nmanufacturers of finished goods who relied heavily on export markets, pressed\nfor lower agricultural tariffs. In the Ruhr, large mining and metal firms strongly\nsupported high tariffs for both industry and agriculture.32\nThirdly, the competing interests of heavy and light industry splintered the\nNational Liberal party and the Left Liberal parties. The former, which was\npermanently weakened in the late 1870s after losing its position as the\n\u2018government party\u2019, split on the question of tariffs as a result of the internal\ndivide between light and heavy industries.33 Its leaders subsequently refused\nto include tariff policy as a party matter.

In the\nRhenish-Westphalian region (with approximately 22 per cent of Germany\u2019s metal workers),\nmembership of the German Metalworkers\u2019 Union (DMV) grew from 1 per cent in 1891, to 12 per\ncent in 1900, and 20 per cent in 1912. In Brandenburg (including Berlin), with approximately 13\nper cent of the nation\u2019s metal workers, 3 per cent were DMV members in 1895, 35 per cent in 1907,\nand 51 per cent in 1912 (Fricke, Handbuch Zur Geschichte Der Deutschen Arbeiter-Bewegung 1869\nbis 1917).\n32 Tipton, Regional Variations in the Economic Development of Germany, p. 140.\n33 Lambi, Free Trade and Protection in Germany 1868\u20131879, pp. 209\u201311.\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 299\nNational Liberals (and to some extent all liberal parties) lacked both a distinctive\nsocial profile and a regional identity.34 This coincided with the National\nLiberals\u2019 claim to speak for the nation rather than for any particular group, but\nit also meant that the liberals were unable to consolidate any electoral\nstrongholds (in contrast to, say, the Centre party that controlled the Catholic\nrural districts35 and the Conservatives who held the agricultural regions east of\nthe Elbe). Socio-economic and regional diversity thereby weakened the political\nparty \u2018focus\u2019 of liberalism.36\nThe inter-industry conflict thesis suggests that while light industry (which\nwas more constrained by labour demands) was more free-trade oriented, heavy\nindustry sought a political alliance with agriculture that would both deliver high\nindustrial tariffs and squash demands for political reform.\nHYPOTHESIS 3: A measure of the conflicting interests of light and heavy industry\nshould therefore be correlated with the voting patterns in the\nReichstag, with representatives of light industry favouring free trade\nand representatives of heavy industry favouring protection.\nThe revisionists also argue that German liberals had multiple and conflicting\ninterests that inhibited their organization and political effectiveness.\nHYPOTHESIS 4: We should thus find that an interests-based model of party affiliation\nperforms comparatively worse for the National Liberal Party and the\nLeft Liberal parties than for the Conservatives, the SPD and the\nCentre parties.\nA test of conflicting interests should not fail to control for one further factor\nthat divided late nineteenth-century German society \u2013 the Kulturkampf (the\n34 Dieter Langewiesche, \u2018German Liberalism in the Second Empire, 1871\u20131914\u2019, in Konrad H.\nJarausch and Larry Eugene Jones, eds, In Search of a Liberal Germany (Oxford: Berg, 1990); Gerhard\nA.

In a recent work, Ju\u00a8rgen R. Winkler (Sozialstruktur, Politische Traditionen und\nLiberalismus: Eine Empirische La\u00a8ngsschnittstudie Zur Wahlentwicklung in Deutschland 1871\u20131933\n(Opladen: Westdeutscher Verlag, 1995)) finds that the correlation between economic structure\n(which he refers to as urbanization) and votes for liberals is non-existent. This article complements\nWinkler\u2019s study in at least three ways: (1) it offers an issue-specific examination of the role of the\nliberal parties vis-a`-vis other parties; (2) the data provide a more highly specified configuration of\nconstituency interests (at the regional level) \u2013 particularly the contrast between agricultural and\nindustrial interests, and between light and heavy industry interests; and (3) the analysis links\nconstituency interests to policy making, through the use of roll-call analysis.\n35 The Centre was clearly a denominational party: \u2018In the elections from 1874 to 1887, the party\nwon, on average, two-thirds of all the votes in constituencies with clear Catholic majorities, whereas\nit acquired fewer than 2 per cent of the votes in districts with clear Protestant majorities\u2019 (Ritter, \u2018The\nSocial Bases of the German Political Parties\u2019, p. 35). Aside from Catholicism, however, the\nsocioeconomic base of the party was heterogenous, including workers, farmers, shop keepers, civil\nservants, industrialists and aristocrats. Because farmers were over-represented (and industrialists\nunder-represented) in the Catholic population, the party tended to favour the interests of agriculture.\n36 Tipton, Regional Variations in the Economic Development of Germany, p. 141.\n300 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nculture struggle against Catholicism).37 Bismarck\u2019s anti-Catholicism, and in\nparticular his campaign against the Centre (Catholic) party, greatly increased\nthe solidarity of German Catholics against the dominant Protestant population.\nThe link between this religious conflict and the marriage of iron and rye is not\nexplicit,38 and so, while I introduce it as a control variable, no hypothesis is\nsuggested for it.\nMarriage from Factor Endowment\nRogowski develops a theory of political coalitions, or \u2018cleavages\u2019, that\nhighlights the importance of relative factor endowments.39 Rogowski\u2019s theory\nrests on the standard assumption of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson (SS) theorem,40\nnamely that protection increases the real income of owners of the relatively\nscarce factor(s) at the expense of owners of the relatively abundant factor(s).\nFor Germany, landowners and capitalists, as owners of relatively scarce factors\nin the late 1870s, stood to gain from protection for agricultural and industrial\nproducts,41 while labour, as the relatively abundant factor, stood to lose. The\nmarriage was consummated because owners of land and capital, and particularly\nthose who used these factors intensively relative to their use of labour,42 were\nnatural partners in an alliance against labour. However, the marriage began to\ndisintegrate when Germany became an advanced economy around 1890\n(Rogowski regards the move to relative capital abundance as synonymous with\nbecoming an advanced economy), at which point capital became a loser from\nprotection under the standard SS analysis. The alliance structure then shifted\nfrom one of class conflict (capital and land v. labour) to an urban\u2013rural split\nwhere capital and labour advocated free trade and landowners remained\nprotectionist.\nA simple test of Rogowski\u2019s theory is to consider whether it fits the pattern\nof trade legislation in Germany. The story seems at first sight to fit the tariff\nlegislation of 1879 and the early 1890s. But, Rogowski emphasizes that after\n37 Evans, The German Centre Party.\n38 One possible link might be the struggle between the Centre party and the SPD over the\nallegiance of Catholic workers (Nolan, Social Democracy and Society). Another might be the\ndemonstration effect of an industrial\/agrarian alliance within the Centre party.\n39 Ronald Rogowski, Commerce and Coalitions: How Trade Affects Domestic Alignments\n(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989).\n40 Wolfgang F. Stolper and Paul A. Samuelson, \u2018Protection and Real Wages\u2019 (reprinted in\nAmerican Economic Association, Readings in the Theory of International Trade (Philadelphia:\nBlakiston, [1941] 1949)).\n41 Rogowski argues that falling transportation costs in the 1870s opened East Elbian Germany to\nforeign competition in grain, thereby making land a scarce factor relative to its abundance in the\nUnited States.\n42 The emphasis on the intensity of factor usage is important, and is a standard attribute of the\nSS theorem. The most intensive users of a scarce factor will be the most protectionist, ceteris paribus.\nHence, in Germany, iron producers are expected to be more protectionist in the 1870s than, say, textile\nproducers who employed more labour per unit of output.\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 301\n1895 capital-intensive new industries (chemicals and electrical equipment) split\nfrom the protectionist CVDI \u2018to found the more free-trading Bund der\nIndustriellen; the wider industrial rebellion against high tariffs that underlay the\nformation of the Hansabund a few years later; and, finally, the victory of the\nlow-tariff forces in the Reichstag elections a few years later.\u201943 \u2018Later\u2019 is very\nmuch the right word, because Rogowski\u2019s chronology skips over the resumption\nof tariffs in 1902, attributing this to a \u2018lag\u2019.44 As long as one is willing to\ndisregard the high tariffs of the first decade of the new century, Rogowski\u2019s\ntheory fares well!\nWe might also test the argument that the intensity of factor endowment in\nparticular industries or agricultural sectors determined alignments on trade\npolicy issues. But, according to Rogowski, in Germany highly capital intensive\nindustries opposed moderately capital intensive industries, while agrarians who\nused land less intensively (dairy and meat producers) did not oppose the\nagrarians who used land intensively (grain producers)..45 This begs the question,\nwhen does factor intensity become great enough to create fissures among owners\nand users of a given factor, and is the answer the same for capital and land? This\nambiguity complicates, but does not preclude, testing the effect of factor\nintensity on trade interests. We may accept Rogowski\u2019s designation of some\nindustries as highly capital-intensive (chemicals and electrical equipment),\nsome as moderately capital-intensive (metals) and some (textiles) as \u2018the least\ncapital-intensive of industries\u2019.46 We may then test whether representatives of\nthese respective industries pressed strongly, moderately or weakly for\nprotection before 1890, and strongly, moderately or weakly for free trade after\n1890. In the absence of significant chemicals and electrical equipment industries\nbefore 1890, a test of \u2018pre\u2019 and \u2018post\u2019 support must rest on metals and textiles\n(which I measure more broadly as heavy and light industry), hypothesizing that\nHYPOTHESIS 5: Representatives of heavy industry should be moderately supportive\nof protection before 1890, and moderately supportive of free trade\nafter 1890.\nSimilarly,\nHYPOTHESIS 6: The representatives of light industry should be weakly supportive\nof protection before 1890, and weakly supportive of free trade\nafter 1890.\nTaking on board Rogowski\u2019s fall-back position of the \u2018lag\u2019 effect, we might\nexpect the \u2018before 1890\u2019 portion of Hypotheses 5 and 6 to hold, but anticipate\n43 Rogowski, Commerce and Coalitions, p. 40.\n44 In correspondence with the author (27 August 1994), Rogowski argues for the existence of \u2018a\nlag of about a generation between a country\u2019s attainment of capital-abundance and its capitalists\u2019\nuniversal recognition of that abundance. The interim seems to be characterized by a lot of infighting\u2019.\nIt remains unclear, however, how a \u2018lag\u2019 explains a move to free trade under Caprivi, and then a move\nback to protection under Bu\u00a8low. Surely the \u2018lag\u2019 argument would predict a delayed move to free trade.\n45 Rogowski (Commerce and Coalitions) footnotes that \u2018some northern German peasants\u2019\nsupported free trade (p. 40).\n46 Rogowski, Commerce and Coalitions, p. 163.\n302 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nno change to have occurred by 1902. A second test of factor intensity has already\nbeen given in Hypothesis 1b. While Rogowski accepts the traditionalists\u2019 notion\nof agrarian unity, stronger support for protection by representatives of grain\nproducers (who used land intensively) than by representatives of cattle\nproducers (who used land less intensively) would lend support to his theory.\nFor easy reference, the six hypotheses from the three interests-based\ninterpretations are as follows:\nTraditional\nHYPOTHESIS 1: Agrarian unity should be reflected in (a) agrarian regions voting\npredominantly for Conservative party representatives; and (b)\ndeputies from agrarian regions voting for agricultural protection\nin the Reichstag.\nHYPOTHESIS 2: Conservative party delegates in the Reichstag should consist-\nently and uniformly support high agricultural tariffs.\nRevisionist\nHYPOTHESIS 3: A measure of the conflicting interests of light and heavy industry\nshould be correlated with the voting patterns in the Reichstag,\nwith representatives of light industry favouring free trade and\nrepresentatives of heavy industry favouring protection.\nHYPOTHESIS 4: We should find that an interests-based model of party affiliation\nperforms comparatively worse for the National Liberal party and\nthe Left Liberal parties than for the Conservatives, the SPD, and\nthe Centre parties.\nFactor Endowment\nHYPOTHESIS 5: Representatives of heavy industry should be moderately support-\nive of protection before 1890, and moderately supportive of free\ntrade after 1890.\nHYPOTHESIS 6: Representatives of light industry should be weakly supportive\nof protection before 1890, and weakly supportive of free trade\nafter 1890.\nTESTING THE THEORIES\nHypotheses 1 through 6 are not exhaustive tests of each theory; rather, they test\nsome of the basic premises of the theories. I employ a variety of analytical tools\nto test these hypotheses, including tabulations of votes by region and by party,\nand conditional and binomial logistic regression.\nMy model of voting behaviour is illustrated in Figure 1. Constituents\u2019\npreferences (as measured by demographic features) influence the votes of their\nrepresentatives both directly (for example, deputies from urban areas will tend\nto support workers\u2019 interests), and indirectly, through the deputies\u2019 party\naffiliation. Arrow (c) reflects the direct effect, while arrows (a) and (b) reflect\nthe indirect effect. Residual effects are given by U and V, illustrating that the\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 303\nFig. 1. A model of voting behaviour\nmodel is probabilistic, not deterministic. The logic of the model stems from both\nthe sociological and psychological approaches to voting behaviour. Voters use\nboth sociological cues (religion, occupational groupings) and party \u2018labels\u2019 to\nguide their choices47 (see Appendix). Deputies, seeking re-election, cast votes\nin accordance with the interests of their constituents. However, deputies\u2019 votes\nalso reflect an ideological component which is partially, but not wholly,\nindicated by party affiliation. If a deputy \u2018shirks\u2019, he may do so either from party\nloyalty (in which case the party stance conflicts with the interests of his\nconstituency, and he chooses party over constituency), or from some\nindependent ideological motivation (which may or may not coincide with his\nparty\u2019s stance, but clearly conflicts with the interests of his constituency). My\nmodel attempts to gauge whether deputies\u2019 votes are consistent with the\ncharacteristics of their constituencies, and whether the votes demonstrate party\nloyalty. Using this model, I test the hypotheses against roll-call votes in the\nReichstag for four divisions.\nThe critical reader may argue that because Imperial Germany was ostensibly\n\u2018authoritarian\u2019, voting behaviour of members of the Reichstag was irrelevant for\ngovernment policy. Three responses may be offered. First, while deputies may\nhave reacted more than acted, and as a body had no legal control over the\nChancellor, Reichstag approval was none the less required for legislation. Most\nof this legislation was limited to economic policy, which Bismarck encouraged\nthe Reichstag to consider. (Other areas of policy such as expanding\nparliamentary power or military matters were virtually closed to debate in the\nReichstag).48 Although the Reichstag was circumscribed in its activities, it could\nexert its authority over trade policy. Secondly, universal male suffrage, secret\nand direct voting, and voting participation rates of 50 per cent (in 1871) rising\nto 85 per cent (in 1907) suggest a democratic electoral system on a par with other\n47 Russell J.

B A I L E Y\nEuropean countries of the time.49 Thirdly, while the Junkers enjoyed\nconsiderable political clout in policy decisions,50 their representatives in the\nReichstag did not vote as a monolithic bloc.\nRegional Divisions\nOne way to analyse the direct effect of constituents\u2019 interests on roll-call votes\n(Figure 1, (c)) entails assessing how closely deputies\u2019 votes matched the\ninterests of the regions containing their constituencies. Table 1 displays these\nvotes across the four divisions \u2013 two motions for higher tariffs (the 1879 and\n1902 autonomous Tariff Laws)51 and two for lower tariffs (the 1893 and 1894\ntrade treaties). The table indicates that the western heavy industry regions\nconstituted a more cohesive voting bloc than the eastern agricultural regions.\nIn 1879 and 1902, support for protection was strong in the regions in which\nmetals and\/or mining industries were important \u2013 Du\u00a8sseldorf (Ruhr), Aachen,\nCologne, Trier and Koblenz, and Upper Silesia.52 In 1893 and 1894 heavy\nindustry in Ruhr and Aachen supported freer trade along with the trade-reliant\nHanse Cities and Berlin (the latter being the only consistent supporter of free\ntrade, whose deputies were of the SPD or Left Liberal parties).\nBavaria was the only highly agricultural region that was a consistently strong\nsupporter of protection. Although support for protection was reasonably strong\nin the eastern regions (East and West Prussia and Posen) in 1879 and 1902,53\nthese regions were far less resistant to freer trade in 1893 and 1894.54 In the case\nof the Russian Treaty this was most probably due to fears of war with Russia\nsince the eastern regions were particularly sensitive to their geographic\nvulnerability. The regional split is less easily explained for the Romanian\nTreaty.\n49 Ritter, \u2018The Social Bases of the German Political Parties\u2019, p. 32.\n50 Puhle, \u2018Lords and Peasants in the Kaiserreich\u2019; Tirrell, German Agrarian Politics After\nBismarck\u2019s Fall.\n51 Unlike earlier divisions, the Reichstag voted on twenty-four different aspects of the 1902 Tariff\nLaw. The seventh division, used here, pertained specifically to the minimum tariff levels allowable\nfor grain.\n52 In 1879 and 1902, the Ruhr had the largest percentage of workers in metals (9.3 per cent in\n1879 and 14.6 per cent in 1902), and in 1879 it had the largest percentage in mining (13.1 per cent).\nOther important mining regions were Upper Silesia (which overtook Ruhr in 1902 by employing 16\nper cent of its workforce in mining), Trier and Koblenz, and Aachen (both employing more than 5\nper cent in mining).\n53 Voting by the Polish members of the Reichstag accounts for a good deal of the lack of support\nfor protection in these regions. In 1879, six Poles from Posen and four from East and West Prussia\nvoted against the tariffs. In 1902, the Poles from Posen were split \u2013 six abstained and four voted for\nhigher protection. The split was also evident in East and West Prussia, where three Poles abstained\nand one from West Prussia voted for protection.\n54 In 1879, East and West Prussia, Bavaria and Posen were the most agricultural regions, with\nover 60 per cent of regional employment in agriculture. In 1902, only Posen remained above 60 per\ncent, while East Prussia exceeded 55 per cent and Bavaria, Pomerania and West Prussia exceeded\n50 per cent.\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 307\nThe traditionalists\u2019 emphasis on agrarian unity (Hypothesis 1(b)) is thus not\nas well supported as might be expected. The heavy industry voting bloc provides\nonly partial support for the divided interests and the factor endowment\napproaches (Hypotheses 3 and 5). Representatives of heavy industry did indeed\nfavour protection in 1879 and 1902, but not in the 1890s (as the divided interests\napproach would have us believe). Moreover, heavy industry\u2019s strong support for\nprotection in 1902 does not bode well for the factor endowment model.\nParties and Voting Behaviour\nTable 1 provides useful information on the distribution of support for protection,\nbut it ignores a vital political component \u2013 the effect of party affiliation on voting\nbehaviour (Figure 1, (b)). German party affiliation is not an easy variable to\nmeasure: during the period from 1879 to 1902, no less than twenty-six different\nparty affiliations appear for members of the Reichstag, not including the bei\nkeiner Fraktion (with no party affiliation, or nonpartisan) members).55\nFollowing standard groupings in the secondary literature, I reduce these to six\nmajor groups of parties: (1) the Conservatives (the Deutsch-Konservative Partei\nand the Reichspartei, or Freikonservativen); (2) the National Liberals\n(Nationalliberale Partei); (3) the Centre (Zentrum); (4) the Minorities (for 1879,\n1893 and 1894, these included only the Poles, but for 1902 also included five\nmembers of the Deutsche-Hannoversche Partei; (5) the Left Liberals (Linkslib-\nerale);56 and (6) the SPD, or Social Democrats (Sozialdemokratische Partei\nDeutschlands). In all four divisions, these six groups accounted for approxi-\nmately 90 per cent of the members who voted.\nCross-tabulations of these party groups and the votes (Table 2) reveal strong\nparty allegiances in 1879, but a weakening of these allegiances thereafter \u2013\nparticularly for the Conservatives. In 1879, all the party groupings except the\nNational Liberals voted almost perfectly along party lines. The Conservatives\nand Centre voted for protection, while the Poles, the Social Democrats, and all\nbut one of the Left Liberals voted against the tariffs. While most of the National\nLiberals voted against the tariffs, about a quarter voted with the government for\nprotection. In 1893 and 1894, the Conservatives, the Centre and the National\nLiberals were all internally divided. Most of the Conservatives favoured\nprotection (although more defected to freer trade with the Russian Treaty) and\nmost of the National Liberals supported the trade treaties, while the Centre was\nalmost evenly divided. The Left Liberals, the Poles and the Social Democrats\nall supported the treaties. In 1902, the Conservatives, the National Liberals and\n55 Max Schwarz, MdR, Biographisches Handbuch der Reichstage (Hanover: Verlag fu\u00a8r Literatur\nund Zeitgeschehen GmbH, 1965); Stenographische Berichte u\u00a8ber die Verhandlungen des Reichstags\n(Berlin: Verlag der Norddeutschen Buchdruckerei und Verlags-Anstalt, various years.\n56 These included for 1879, the Liberale Vereinigung, the Fortschrittspartei, and the Deutsche\nVolkspartei; for 1893 and 1894, the Deutsche Freisinnige Volkspartei and the Freisinnige\nVereinigung; and for 1902, the Deutsche Freisinnige Volkspartei, the Deutsche Fortschrittliche\nVolkspartei, the Deutsche Volkspartei, the Fortschrittspartei and the Freisinnige Vereinigung.\n308 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n2\nR\nei\nch\nst\nag\nVo\nte\ns\nby\nP\nar\nty\nAf\nfili\nati\non 18\n93\nR\nom\nan\nia\nn\n18\n94\nR\nus\nsi\nan\n19\n02\nTa\nrif\nf\n18\n79\nTa\nrif\nf\nTr\nea\nty\nTr\nea\nty\n(d\nivi\nsio\nn\n7)\nPa\nrty\nG\nro\nup\nin\ng\nFo\nr\nA\nga\nin\nst\nFo\nr\nA\nga\nin\nst\nA\nbs\n.\nFo\nr\nA\nga\nin\nst\nA\nbs\n.\nFo\nr\nA\nga\nin\nst\nA\nbs\n.\nSo\nci\nal\nD\nem\noc\nra\nts\n0\n7\n37\n0\n4\n39\n0\n2\n1\n42\n16\nLe\nft\nLi\nbe\nra\nls\n1\n23\n35\n0\n0\n33\n0\n2\n4\n22\n14\nM\nin\nor\niti\nes\n0\n10\n15\n0\n2\n15\n0\n2\n9\n0\n11\nC\nen\ntre\n77\n0\n44\n49\n4\n45\n39\n13\n87\n0\n14\nN\nat\nio\nna\nlL\nib\ner\nal\ns\n20\n65\n33\n13\n4\n33\n16\n1\n41\n9\n4\nC\non\nse\nrv\nat\niv\nes\n99\n0\n9\n79\n4\n14\n69\n9\n48\n12\n14\nO\nth\ner\n20\n12\n17\n22\n8\n21\n21\n5\n9\n20\n16\nTo\nta\nl\n21\n7\n11\n7\n19\n0\n16\n3\n26\n20\n0\n14\n5\n34\n19\n9\n10\n5\n89\nNo\nte\n:T\nhe\no\nn\nly\ndi\nvi\nsio\nn\nin\nw\nhi\nch\nth\ne\nab\nsta\nin\nin\ng\nde\npu\ntie\nsw\ner\ne\nlis\nte\nd\nas\nsu\nch\nw\nas\n19\n02\n.T\nhe\nita\nlic\niz\ned\nv\no\nte\ns\nfo\nr1\n89\n3\nan\nd\n18\n94\nin\ndi\nca\nte\nsm\nem\nbe\nrs\nw\nho\nv\no\nte\nd\nin\n18\n94\nbu\ntn\no\nti\nn\n18\n93\n(an\ndv\nic\ne\nv\ner\nsa\n),\nan\nd\nth\nus\nap\npr\nox\nim\nat\ne\nth\ne\nco\nu\nn\ntf\nor\nab\nste\nnt\nio\nns\n.\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 309\nthe Left Liberals were all internally divided, although most Conservatives and\nNational Liberals favoured higher tariffs and the vast majority of the Left\nLiberals opposed them. The Minorities (Poles plus the German Hanover party)\nshifted from their earlier free trade stance to support higher tariffs. All of the\nCentre voted for protection and all but one of the Social Democrats voted against\nthe higher tariffs.\nIt is clear that party affiliation mattered more for some parties than for others\nand that for all parties (except the SPD), party unity varied over time. In sum,\nparty affiliation and regional interests each capture part of the variation in voting\nbehaviour. Any model of Reichstag voting must therefore incorporate both these\ntwo factors.\nThe Regression Model\nOne way to measure the relationships between (1) the economic composition\nof members\u2019 constituencies, (2) members\u2019 party affiliation, and (3) votes on\ntrade policy in the Reichstag, is to estimate a log-linear model. Log-linear\nanalysis would not, however, incorporate interval-level data on the economic\ncomposition of each region. Since this information is useful for testing the six\nhypotheses, I instead employ conditional and binomial logistic regression.\nMeasures of constituency characteristics. For simplicity, and to minimize\nproblems of multicollinearity, I use five measures for constituency characteris-\ntics, all measured at the regional level for years near to 1879, 1893\/4 and 1902.57\nAgrarian unity is tested with two variables: (1) the number of hectares (\u2019000s)\nin the region used for growing wheat and rye; and (2) the number of cows (and\npigs for 1893, 1894 and 1902) in the region (\u2019000s).58 Hypothesis 1 predicts that\nrepresentatives from agricultural regions will support protection, and that this\nsupport will not differ substantially between representatives from grain\nproducing and animal husbandry areas. Contrary evidence would weaken the\ntraditional approach and strengthen the factor endowment approach. Employ-\nment data are taken as indicators of the interests of light and heavy industry.\nLight industry measures the percentage of workers in the region employed in\nthe production of textiles, clothing, wood products, leather and printing. Heavy\nindustry measures the percentage of workers in the region employed in\n57 The agriculture and religion variables are from Kaiserliches Statistisches Amt., Statistisches\nJahrbuch fu\u00a8r das Deutsche Reich (Berlin: Puttkammer & Mu\u00a8hlbrecht) for 1878\/79, 1892 and 1902.\nData for light and heavy industry are from Tipton, Regional Variations in the Economic Development\nof Germany, using the years 1882, 1895 and 1907. Data limitations are discussed in the Appendix.\n58 In preliminary analysis, a simple dummy variable for East Elbian regions was used to\ndifferentiate grain producers from producers of other agricultural goods. This variable yielded very\nsimilar results (for both the conditional and binomial logistic models) to those for the two variables\ndescribed in the text. I also tested whether wheat and rye yields (indexed by the national average\nyield and weighted by the share of acreage given to each crop in the region) affected party affiliation\nof deputy or support for protection. This variable performed poorly and was dropped.\n310 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nmetalworking, machinery, mining and quarrying.59 Hypothesis 3 predicts that\nrepresentatives of light industry interests will support free trade and represen-\ntatives of heavy industry will support protection. Evidence of a clear split in\nthese interests would be consistent with the divided interests approach.\nHypothesis 5 predicts a shift in heavy industry\u2019s support from protection to free\ntrade, while Hypothesis 6 predicts a similar, but notably weaker, shift in support\nfrom light industry.60 Evidence to the contrary would weaken the factor\nendowment approach. Finally, the percentage of the Catholic population in each\nregion is included as a control variable (as discussed earlier).\nPredicting party affiliation. Arrow (a) in Figure 1 indicates that voters\u2019 choices\nare in part a function of socioeconomic features of the constituency. To test this\nformally, I use the five variables for constituency characteristics to estimate\nparty affiliation. The constituency variables are measured at the interval-level\nand the dependent variable consists of the six party groups. (For reasons\nexplained in the Appendix, two party-specific variables are also included.) I use\na conditional logit model, since common regression models like OLS or logit\nare inappropriate for models with multiple non-ordered categories for the\ndependent variable.61 Unlike binomial logit, where the dependent variable is\nnormally coded 0 or 1, in conditional logit it normally begins with 1 rather than\n0 and continues to K levels. The codes for party affiliation are, SPD (1), Left\nLiberal (2), Minorities (3), Centre (4), National Liberal (5), and Conservative\n(6) (K 5 6). The ordering of the categories is irrelevant, except for the baseline\ncategory which should, ideally, reflect a \u2018natural\u2019 base category (if one exists)\nand\/or have the largest number of cases. The Conservatives were chosen as the\ncategory most approximating these criteria. The baseline category is the\nreference category for a series of binomial logits (or submodels for each\ncategory against the baseline category) that are estimated simultaneously.\nEstimates are generated for K 2 1 sub-models (here 5), and thus can be far from\nsimple to interpret. These coefficients and significance tests are reported in\nTables 3\u20135. The tables also report various measures of good fit, including the\npercentages correctly predicted, the log-likelihood ratio and McFadden\u2019s r2, a\npseudo R2 value.62\n59 Clay and mining are grouped with metals as industries that formed the nucleus of the CVDI\n(Eley, \u2018The British Model and the German Road\u2019, p. 106).\n60 Elsewhere I explore the effects of geographic concentration of industry interests on support for\nprotection in the marriage of iron and rye (\u2018Sorting the Wheat from the Chaff: The \u201cMarriage of Iron\nand Rye\u201d Revisited\u2019 (unpublished working paper, London School of Economics and Political\nScience, 1994); and also, Modelling Ideology and Interests: Agricultural Trade in Britain and\nGermany, forthcoming).\n61 Alan Agresti, Categorical Data Analysis (New York: Wiley, 1990). For further explanation of\nconditional logit, and how it differs from multinomial logit, see the Appendix.\n62 Pseudo R2s are often criticized, however (John H. Aldrich and Forrest D. Nelson, Linear\nProbability, Logit, and Probit Models (London: Sage, 1984).\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 311\nThe party-specific variables perform poorly in all three regressions.63 On the\nwhole, the remaining variables provide a reasonable fit for party choice (on\naverage, 39 per cent correctly predicted), but with some clear exceptions. Small\nnumbers of Social Democrats and Minorities create severe multicollinearity\nproblems for those two submodels in 1879 and 1894 (Tables 3 and 4), making\ninterpretation of these coefficients inadvisable. By contrast, economic interests\nexplain quite large percentages of the Centre and Conservatives. Both liberal\nparties are less well predicted by an interests-based model, lending support to\nthe divided interests approach (Hypothesis 4) which suggests that the liberals\nlacked a socio-economic profile.\nThe significance and sign of each predictor varies markedly from party to\nparty, but one theme is conspicuous. The emphasis of the traditionalists on\nagrarian unity (Hypothesis 1 (a)) is not warranted by the evidence. A clear split\nbetween grain and animal producers is evident for the Left Liberal, Centre and\nNational Liberal submodels. Grain producing constituencies consistently voted\nConservative while animal producing constituencies consistently voted against\nthe Conservatives. A derivative table provides another way to look at the\ninfluence of these two variables (Table 6).64 (I do not present the derivative\ntables for 1879 and 1894, since the multicollinearity problems mentioned above\nwould distort the averages.) When the grain producing area increased by 1,000\nhectares (one unit), the probability of returning a Conservative deputy increased\nby 0.0008, while the probability of returning a National Liberal decreased by\n2 0.0005 (and so on, for each party). Similarly, when the number of cows and\npigs increased by 1,000, the probability of returning a Conservative deputy\ndecreased by 2 0.0002. To illustrate, compare East Prussia with Baden. In 1900,\nEast Prussia had about 543,000 hectares of grain-producing area and\napproximately 1,904,000 cows and pigs. For Baden, the numbers approximated\n87,000 and 4,823,000, respectively. Thus, while its large grain area increased\nthe probability of East Prussia returning a Conservative deputy by 0.43, animal\nhusbandry decreased the probability by 2 0.38 (ceteris paribus). Baden\u2019s\nrelatively small grain area increased the probability of returning a Conservative\nby only 0.07, while its specialism in animal husbandry decreased the probability\nof returning a Conservative by 2 0.96 (ceteris paribus). Not surprisingly, in\n63 This suggests that the \u2018problem\u2019 of IIA discussed in the Appendix is probably overstated.\nIndeed, removing the party-specific variables (and thereby reverting to standard multinomial logit)\nbarely affects the remaining coefficients. Thus, estimation based on an assumption of equal choice\nprobabilities (PSDP 5 PLL 5 PM 5 PZ 5 PNL 5 PDK 5 16 ) is unlikely to be far from the mark.64 A derivative table tells how the probabilities of each of the outcomes change in response to a\nchange in the covariate values. For example, when the percentage of Catholics (% Catholics)\nincreases by one, the probability of voting Catholic goes up by 0.68, while the probability of voting\nConservative goes down by 0.29 (and so on, with each category of party). The sum of the entries\nin each row is zero since an increase in the probability of one category is offset by a decrease in another\ncategory. The constant provides no useful interpretation and so is not presented in Table 6. The table\nallows one to observe how the probabilites of the parties change as values of the independent variables\nchange.

That is, nearly\ntwo-thirds of party affiliation is \u2018independent\u2019 of what the literature has\nidentified as key constituency characteristics.\nPredicting voting behaviour. If the constituency interests model perfectly, or\nalmost perfectly, predicts deputies\u2019 party affiliation, a reduced form equation\nshould be used for predicting the vote.65 However, Tables 3\u20135 suggest that 61\nper cent of deputies\u2019 party affiliation cannot be explained by constituency\ncharacteristics, and therefore a two-stage estimation is inappropriate. Instead,\nI present three models for roll-call voting behaviour \u2013 measuring the effects of:\n(1) constituency characteristics (entitled \u2018Economic Interests Only\u2019); (2)\npolitical party affiliation; and (3) party affiliation and constituency interests\ncombined. The last model attempts to capture both paths indicated in Figure 1,\nwhile the first and second represent arrows (c) and (b) exclusively. Although\ncollinearity between parties and interests lowers the efficiency of the estimators,\nwith the consequences evident in significance tests, the estimates are fairly\nrobust. Tables 7\u201310 present results using the three models for roll-call votes in\n1879, 1893, 1894 and 1902, while Figures 2\u20135 illustrate the distributions of the\npredicted probabilities. Only the parties that divided are included as dummy\nvariables (see Table 2). Parties that voted unanimously (excluding abstentions)\nare excluded from this analysis since party affiliation perfectly predicts their\nvotes. The only party group excluded from all of the divisions is Minorities; all\nother parties divided over at least one vote.\nFig. 2. Distribution of predicted probabilities (1879)\n65 A reduced form equation would endogenize party affiliation, so that the exogenous component\nof party affiliation would not be estimated (Gordon Hilton, Intermediate Politometrics (New York:\nColumbia University Press, 1976); Eric A. Hanushek and John E. Jackson, Statistical Methods for\nSocial Scientists (Orlando, Fla.: Academic Press, 1977)).\n320 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nFigures 2\u20135 provide an intuitive \u2018feel\u2019 for how the combined model improves\nupon the interests-only model. (The parties-only model has no distribution to\nillustrate, since all party members are assigned identical probabilities. That is,\nfor each party, a fixed point \u2013 rather than a spread of points \u2013 is predicted for\nall party members, regardless of the economic make-up of their constituencies.\nIn contrast, it is the economic make-up of the constituencies that defines the\nspread of probabilities for the interests-only model. Thus, I report single-point\nestimates for the parties-only model.) Box and whiskers plots,66 grouped by\nparty, show the spread of probabilities of voting for the legislation that each\nmodel predicts. A good fit is graphically illustrated by a narrow box (hinge\nspread), short whiskers (lines extending to the largest and smallest values that\nare not outliers), and few outliers (solid circles indicating outside values, and\nopen circles far outside values). Moreover, greater certainty in predicting\ndeputies\u2019 votes is illustrated by boxes clustered towards the far left (low\nprobability) or the far right (high probability). In 1879, the parties-only model\nestimates that the probability of voting for the tariff was 0.042 for Left Liberals\nand 0.235 for National Liberals. The interests plot illustrates the effect of\nconstituency interests on vote prediction, while the combined plot illustrates the\njoint effect of party affiliation and constituency interests on vote prediction. The\ncombined model improves upon the interests model most dramatically for the\nLeft Liberals, while only a marginal improvement is obtained for the National\nLiberals. This finding underscores the divisiveness within the National Liberal\nparty (hence the wider spread of the predicted votes) relative to the more united\nstance of the Left Liberals. In 1893 and 1894, the parties-only model (not shown\nhere) estimates that the probabilities of the Centre (Zentrum), National Liberals\nand Conservatives supporting the trade treaties were (respectively) 0.473, 0.717,\nand 0.102, for 1893, and 0.536, 0.673, and 0.169 for 1894 (meaning that party\naffiliation alone would predict strong support for the treaties from the National\nLiberals, moderate support from the Centre, and very weak support from the\nConservatives).\nTurning to Figures 3 and 4, the combined model improves upon the interests\nmodel particularly well for the Conservatives, less well for the National\nLiberals, and only marginally for the Centre. Thus, to rely solely on party\naffiliation to predict Reichstag votes, one would ignore the variability that arises\nwithin parties as members represent different regional interests. The particularly\nwide box for the Centre party in the interests model reflects its broad\nsocio-economic constituency base, and its continued spread in the combined\nmodel illustrates that party cohesion was insufficient to overcome the regional\ndifferences. Contrast this with the Conservatives who, based on constituency\ninterests, were moderately spread around the anti-free trade position. Yet, by\n66 David Knoke and George W. Bohrnstedt, Statistics for Social Data Analysis (Itasca: F.E.\nPeacock, 1994).\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 321\nFig. 3. Distribution of predicted probabilities (1893)\nFig. 4. Distribution of predicted probabilities (1894)\nadding party affiliation to constituency interests (the combined model), one\nobserves a dramatic consolidation of the predicted vote spread around a lower\nprobability. The vote spread does not, however, disappear \u2013 as it would if one\nrelied solely on party affiliation to predict the vote. To reiterate, neither interests\nnor party affiliation alone provide an adequate predictor of the legislative vote;\nmoreover, a combined approach allows one to observe the different weights of\nthese two variables across parties. In 1902, the parties-only model estimates that\nthe probability of voting for the tariff was 0.023 for the SPD, 0.820 for the\nNational Liberals, 0.154 for the Left Liberals, and 0.8 for the Conservatives\n(indicating strong support from the National Liberals and Conservatives and\nextremely weak support from the SPD and Left Liberals). The contrast between\nthe interests-only and the combined models is quite stark. The combined model\n322 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\ndemonstrates that party affiliation vastly improves certainty in modelling vote\nchoice. One might be tempted to ignore constituency interests in this vote, given\nthe strong influence of party affiliation in consolidating the predicted\nprobabilities. However, to do so would miss the interests-based variability that\nremained within both the National Liberal and the Conservative parties.\nContrast this with the virtually non-existent vote spread for the SPD and the Left\nLiberals in the combined model. This model illustrates the stronger ideological\ncommitment to the party stance within these two parties.\nTables 7\u201310 specify the fit of each model. In each division the combined\nmodel increases the percentage of cases correctly predicted. The parties and the\ninterests models predict roughly the same percentages of cases, except in 1902\nwhen party affiliation predicts 73.5 per cent of the votes, interests predict 54.4\nper cent, and together they predict 79.6 per cent. The success index allows us\nto specify how much the estimated model improves upon a purely random\nmodel.67 In 1879 the improvement from each of the three models is considerably\ngreater for the protectionist vote than for the freer trade vote. In the remaining\ndivisions, the improvement from the models is more balanced between the\nprotectionists and the freer traders. All measures of fit indicate that party\naffiliation and interests (together) predict the 1902 vote quite well, and the\nRussian treaty (1894) least well. Arguably, the strategic implications of trade\nwith Russia constituted an important omitted variable (given in Figure 1 to U).\nThe regression estimates suggest that each of the theoretical approaches\ncaptures part of the story, but none tells all. The cracks in the agrarian alliance\nseen in Table 1 are also evident in the estimates. In 1879 and 1902, no significant\ndifference is evident between grain and animal producers. In 1893 and 1894,\nhowever, representatives of grain producers opposed lower tariffs while the\nFig. 5.

Hypothesis 1b is thus\nsupported for the years of autonomous tariff legislation, but not for the Caprivi\nyears. This is, perhaps, clear evidence for the traditionalists\u2019 claim that the\nCaprivi\u2019s trade reforms were an anomalous period. Historians who fault the\ntraditionalists for overemphasizing agrarian unity might, by contrast, point to\nthe split between grain and animal producers in the Caprivi years as evidence\nof disunity within the agrarian movement. Both factions within the traditionalist\ncamp would probably agree that agrarian unity was strongest in 1879 (not 1902,\ndespite the activities of the Farmers\u2019 League), since only then did the\nConservatives vote unanimously for protection. In 1893, 1894 and 1902, the\nConservative party dummy (in the combined model) none the less confirms a\nstrong pro-protection stance amongst most of its deputies, thereby supporting\nHypothesis 2. In brief, while newer historians might stress agrarian disunity,\nConservative party delegates overwhelmingly supported high agricultural\ntariffs across all four divisions.\nThe findings for Hypotheses 3, 5 and 6 (which all relate to the interests of\nheavy and light industry) give greater weight to the factor endowment than the\ndivided interests approach. In 1879 neither the light nor heavy industry\ncoefficient is significant, although both are positively signed. For 1879 only, two\nadditional measures could be calculated for heavy industry by region: (1) value\n(in current marks) for primary production of all metals (casting and smelting);\nand (2) value (in current marks) for iron mining output. Substituting these\nmeasures for heavy industry produced positive signs for both the new measure\nand for light industry. For the regression with the \u2018all metals\u2019 variable, both\nindustry variables were significant at 5 per cent, while with the \u2018iron mining\u2019\nvariable the new measure was significant at 10 per cent, but light industry was\nnot significant. Consistency in these findings suggests that no observable\ndifference existed between the representatives of light and heavy industry in\n1879. For the later divisions, both light and heavy industry coefficients are\nsignificant. In 1893 and 1894, representatives of heavy industry voted in favour\nof the freer trade treaties, while in 1902, these representatives reverted to\nfavouring tariff protection. Representatives of light industry opposed freer trade\nin the 1890s, and also opposed tariff protection in 1902. While the interests\ncertainly appear to be divided, the signs for the 1890s are opposite to the ones\npredicted by the divided interests approach. Hypothesis 3 is therefore not\nsupported (except for 1902). According to the factor endowment theory, heavy\nindustry should moderately (and light industry weakly) support protection in\n1879, and moderately (weakly) support free trade in the 1890s and 1902. The\nfindings for 1879 are as expected. The signs for heavy industry in the 1890s bear\nout the expectation, but 1902 confounds it. Conversely, the representatives of\nlight industry vote as predicted in 1902, but not in the 1890s. The factor\nendowment theory rightly captures a shift between the pre- and post-1890 years,\nbut cannot explain the protectionist stance of light industry in the 1890s, nor the\nresumed enthusiasm for protection by heavy industry in 1902.\nIn sum, the traditional view correctly emphasizes the Conservatives as the\n328 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\nparty of the agrarians; the divided interests view rightly notes that the liberal\nreform movement lacked a socio-economic base of support; and the factor\nendowment theory captures the shift in interests that occurred as Germany\u2019s\neconomy advanced. Yet, the traditionalists exaggerate German agrarian unity;\nthe divided interests approach overemphasizes the cleavages between light and\nheavy industry, and (perhaps as a result) fails to capture the fluidity of industry\u2019s\ninterests as the German economy developed; and the factor endowment theory\nignores heavy industry\u2019s renewed support for protection in 1902.\nDISCUSSION\nThe three interpretations of the marriage demonstrate a progression in theory\non German political economy. In the late 1920s, Kehr rebuked contemporary\nGerman historiography, which argued that statesmen were \u2018motivated by a\nrationally defensible concept of national interest\u2019.68 Kehr\u2019s socio-economic\nframework suggested that the tariffs of 1879 and 1902 were both integral to\nanti-socialist strategies. While Bismarck attempted to destroy the socialist threat\nby legislative fiat, Bu\u00a8low sought to transfer the attention of the proletariat away\nfrom domestic concerns to foreign policy (Sammlungspolitik). Gerschenkron\nbuilt upon Kehr\u2019s work by contributing a deeper understanding of the economic\ninterests of the two coalition partners. In contrast, the divided interests approach\nhas questioned the simplicity of the traditional interpretation, arguing that\nindustrialists were neither as monolithic nor as subservient as suggested. Light\nindustry generally supported free trade, and heavy industry supported\nprotectionism. One reason for this divided stance was that socialism affected\nheavy and light industry differently, with the former industry in a stronger\ndefensive position than the latter. On one point, however, the traditional and\ndivided interests approaches agree \u2013 that Caprivi\u2019s reforms, which split the\nmarriage, were a historic anomaly.\nMore recently, Rogowski has provided an explanation which incorporates\nthe disintegration of the marriage in the 1890s into a theoretical framework.\nRogowski argues that Germany followed a predictable pattern of coalition\nformation; it was not an historically unique case of political development, as\nsuggested by the traditionalists and revisionists. His rational choice framework\nallows one to set aside the specific historical context in favour of a generalizable\ntheory of political alignments. Whereas previous interpretations portray a static\nmarriage punctuated by a rift in the early 1890s, Rogowski\u2019s theory introduces\na dynamism into the interests of the partners, as well as the factions within them.\nAs Germany\u2019s economy became advanced (as evidenced by its relative factor\nendowment), the interests of factor owners changed and the marriage began to\ndisintegrate. However, theoretical elegance has its price: Rogowski is forced to\ndismiss the anomalous resumption of high tariffs of 1902 as a \u2018lag\u2019, and in so\n68 Craig, in Kehr, Economic Interest, Militarism, and Foreign Policy, p. x.\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 329\ndoing he misses the intensity of class conflict which defines German political\ndevelopment in the early twentieth century.\nThe evidence in this article suggests a middle ground between the\nsocio-economic perspective of the traditionalists and revisionists, and\nRogowski\u2019s rational choice framework \u2013 a middle ground that compromises\nsome of the elegance of factor endowment theory in order to capture important\npolitical anomalies of the German case. The two anomalies \u2013 the protectionist\nstance of light industry in the 1890s and the renewed support for protection by\nheavy industry in 1902 \u2013 can be explained easily by reintroducing insights\ngained from the traditionalists and revisionists. Within Rogowski\u2019s long-run\ntime frame, during which capital shifted from protectionism to free trade, is a\nshort-run time frame of about ten years, during which social forces mitigated\nthe impact of this shift in economic interests. Light industry supported\nprotectionism in the early 1890s because the SPD and the free trade unions were\nnot yet firmly embedded in it. After the Anti-Socialist legislation was abandoned\nand the Subversion Bill of 1896 failed, the SPD and the free trade unions were\nessentially unhindered in their growth,69 particularly within light industry. Light\nindustry\u2019s support for free trade in 1902 is consistent both with the divided\ninterests and the factor endowment models, a finding one may attribute either\nto increased exposure to labour\u2019s demands or to relative capital abundance.\nHeavy industry\u2019s renewed support for protection in 1902 is persuasive evidence\nof reactionary anti-socialism, but is overlooked by Rogowski\u2019s long-run theory.\nThe cleavage in interests predicted by Rogowski eventually emerges, but an\ninteresting and important short-run dimension is lost before reaching that\neventuality. While my findings lend some weight to the factor endowment\nmodel, they also caution us against dismissing entirely the socio-economic\ncontext of German development. Bluntly stated, factor ownership may yield an\naccurate long-run explanation, but to account for short-run \u2018lags\u2019, one must\nconsider political-ideological motivations.\nIn analysing the mix between economic interests and ideological motivations,\nthis study has also explored the effects of both constituents\u2019 interests and\nrepresentatives\u2019 political party affiliation on roll-call votes. Most authors focus\non the direct effect of constituents\u2019 interests (arrow (c), Figure 1). Here, I shed\nnew light on the indirect effect of constituents interests on roll-call votes (arrows\n(a) and (b)). The conditional logistic regression estimates suggest that the link\nbetween constituency interests and parties was strongest for the Conservatives\nand Centre, weaker for the SPD, and weakest for the liberal parties.\nConservative and Centre deputies apparently had less scope for shirking\n(suggesting a stronger indirect effect of constituency interests on Conservative\nand Centre votes), and the liberal and SPD deputies greater scope (suggesting\n69 Between 1890 and 1903, the SPD\u2019s national vote share rose from 19.7 per cent to 31.7 per cent;\nits share of Reichstag deputies rose from 8.8 per cent to 20.4 per cent (W. L. Guttsman, The German\nSocial Democratic Party, 1875\u20131933 (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1981).\n330 S C H O N H A R D T - B A I L E Y\na weaker indirect effect on these deputies\u2019 votes). Table 2 suggests that the\nSPD and the Left Liberals exploited the weaker constituency link with party\nunity in voting. In sum, interests were felt most strongly through the\nConservatives and Centre, while political party ideology was felt most strongly\nthrough the SPD and the Left Liberals. For the Conservatives, interests mattered\nmore after 1879, while the ideology of the SPD and Left Liberals lasted through\nthe entire period.\nAPPENDIX\nThe Model\nArrow (a) in Figure 1 requires some explication of the underlying modelling assumptions. I\nfirst assume that constituency n selects a candidate from party i, where i is one alternative from\nset Jn.70 I then assume that constituencies have six party choices \u2013 Social Democrats, Left\nLiberals, Minorities, Centre, National Liberals or Conservatives. The probability that\nconstituency n chooses party i from set Jn (call this Pin) is a function of the characteristics of\nalternative i compared with the other alternatives (call this zin relative to all zjn for j in Jn, j \u00de i)\nand certain characteristics of the region in which the constituency is located (sn). Thus,\nPin 5 f (zin; zjn for all j \u00de i, sn, b, d),\nwhere b and d specify vectors of estimated parameters.\nIn choosing one party over the others, the constituency is assumed to maximize its utility,\nUin, part of which is observable (Win) and part of which is given to random variation (ein). Thus,\nUin 5 Win 1 ein.\nLet Win comprise the functional components of Pin, so that\nWin 5 zinb 1 sndi.\nWin is thus assumed to be a function of both the characteristics of the party (zin) and the region\nin which the constituency is situated (sn). Parameter b is estimated for the characteristics of\nthe party and parameter di is estimated for the characteristics of the region\/constituency. The\nsubscript i indicates that the effects of regional characteristics vary across the parties.\nThe mixed, or conditional logit model follows the general multinomial logit model, but\ncontains both characteristics of the constituencies\/regions and characteristics of the parties. The\nconditional logit model is designed to overcome overestimation and underestimation of\nprobabilities that might arise from the independence from irrelevant alternatives property (IIA)\nexhibited by logit probabilities.71 It follows the form of logit models, thus allowing the\n70 To avoid confusion, I follow the standard notation for the multinomial model, which subscripts\nJ with n. The subscript in this case would indicate that different constituencies might face parties\nwith different characteristics. For illustration, let ideology be a characteristic of the alternatives. Some\nparties were very conservative, some were very liberal and some were neither very conservative nor\nvery liberal. A conservative constituency might then assign utility weights to the ideology\ncharacteristic of each of the parties that would differ from the weights assigned by a liberal\nconstituency. However, since it is impossible to know such a weighting scheme for each constituency,\nI assume a common (and very simple) weighting scheme for the attributes of the parties (see text\nof Appendix).\n71 The model is McFadden\u2019s \u2018conditional\u2019 logit model (also known as the \u2018Mother Logit\u2019 (Kenneth\nTrain, Qualitative Choice Analysis: Theory, Econometrics, and an Application to Automobile\nParties and Interests in the \u2018Marriage of Iron and Rye\u2019 331\n(f\u2019note continued)\nDemand (London: MIT Press, 1986)). McFadden (Daniel McFadden, \u2018Conditional Logit Analysis\nof Qualitative Choice Behavior\u2019, in P. Zarembka, ed., Frontiers in Econometrics (New York:\nAcademic Press, 1974); McFadden, \u2018Econometric Analysis of Qualitative Response Models\u2019, in Zvi\nGriliches and Michael D. Intriligator, eds, Handbook of Econometrics, vol. II (Amsterdam:\nNorth-Holland, 1984); McFadden, \u2018Qualitative Response Models\u2019, in Werner Hildenbrand, ed.,\nAdvances in Econometrics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982) has shown that the\nproperty of Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) (which, by assuming that each\nalternative is independent from alternatives other than the reference alternative, can overestimate the\nprobability of some alternatives and underestimate the probability of others) can be corrected to give\nthe true probabilities, with an appropriate specification of Win. Other statisticians (Train, Qualitative\nChoice Analysis, pp. 21\u20134; and Agresti, Categorical Data Analysis, pp. 316\u201317) have generally\nagreed with this assessment. (Additionally, Train has noted that the inclusion of alternative-specific\nconstants \u2013 which I include in my model \u2013 \u2018can mitigate, and in some cases remove, inaccuracies\ndue to logit\u2019s independence of irrelevant alternatives property\u2019 (p. 25).)\nThe problem of IIA and the remedy adopted in this article may be interpreted as follows. The\nestimation procedure in standard multinomial logit (MNL) calculates a series of binary logits (SPD\nversus Conservatives (DK), Left Liberals (LL) versus Conservatives, Minorities (M) versus\nConservatives, Centre (Z) versus Conservatives, National Liberals (NL) versus Conservatives).\nIn each of these calculations, the ratio of each two probabilities (for example, SPD versus\nConservatives) is assumed not to depend on any other alternatives (in this case, the Left Liberals,\nMinorities, Centre or National Liberals). MNL thus assumes that the choice probabilities are equal\nand sum to one (that is, PSDP 5 PLL 5 PM 5 PZ 5 PNL 5 PDK 5 16). Consequently, if the true choice\nprobabilities reflected three groupings \u2013 say, (1) SPD or LL; (2) M, Z or NL; and (3) DK \u2013 with\nequal probabilities (PSDP 5 PLL 5 16 and PM 5 PZ 5 PNL 5 19 and PDK 5 13), the assumed choice\nprobabilities would underestimate some party choices (DK) and overestimate others (M, Z and\nNL). If, however, Win depends on characteristics of alternatives other than i and k (where k is the\nreference category, or Conservatives), the model need not exhibit IIA. Two characteristics of the\nalternatives are likely to be relevant to constituencies choosing a representative \u2013 ideology and\nreligion.\nAn alternative functional form, multinomial probit (MNP), might have been used to estimate party\nchoice. MNP, too, has its disadvantages, notably the computational difficulty in estimating five or\nmore alternatives (McFadden, \u2018Qualitative Response Models\u2019). McFadden (\u2018Econometric Analysis\nof Qualitative Response Models\u2019) finds that \u2018the multinomial logit model scores well on simplicity\nand computation, but poorly on flexibility. The multinomial probit model is simple and flexible, but\nscores poorly on computation. Variants of these models, the nested multinomial logit model and the\nfactorial multinomial probit model, attempt to achieve both flexibility and computational\npracticality\u2019. Others are wary of using probit since it requires one to assume a normal distribution\nfor the cumulative density function. In the absence of any strong justification for the normality\nassumption in one\u2019s application, logit is the preferred estimation technique (Edward D. Lawrence\nand Nasser Arshadi, \u2018A Multinomial Logit Analysis of Problem Loan Resolution Choices in\nBanking\u2019, Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, 27 (1995), 202\u201316).\nSome political scientists (R. Michael Alvarez and Jonathan Nagler, \u2018Correlated Disturbances in\nDiscrete Choice Models: A Comparison of Multinomial Probit Models and Logit Models\u2019 (California\nInstitute of Technology Social Science Working Paper 914, 1994); Alvarez and Nagler, \u2018Economics\nIssues and the Perot Candidacy: Voter Choice in the 1992 Presidential Election\u2019, American Journal\nof Political Science, 39 (1995), 714\u201344) have argued strongly in favour of the use of MNP, in view\nof the IIA problem in standard MNL. In spite of their praise of MNP, they note that it too has several\nundesirable features (the estimation difficulties noted by McFadden and unusually large standard\nerrors of the coefficient estimates, to name just two). They conclude that conditional logit may\nprovide reasonable estimates, particularly when the research is not concerned with the effect of\nadding or removing an alternative from the choice set. (Here, the choice set remains constant at six\nacross all the years. Addition or deletion of party choices is not a concern of this article.)\n"}
