Datta4\n2Child andFamilyDepartment, TavistockClinic, 120Belsize Lane,\nLondonNW35BA,UK; 3Academic unit of Psychiatry, Leeds,UK;\n4Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Royal\nManchester Children\u2019s Hospital, Manchester, UK\nKey words: cochrane\/childhood onset\/schizophrenia\nChildhood-onset schizophrenia is defined as schizophre-\nnia with onset prior to the age of 13 years. Although it is\nrare, those who suffer from schizophrenia at an early age\nappear to have a clinically severe form of the illness with\na poor long-term prognosis. Antipsychotic medication is\none way of managing this rare but serious mental illness.\nA new Cochrane review examines antipsychotic medica-\ntion for childhood-onset schizophrenia.1\nObjective\nTo determine the effects of antipsychotic medication in\nthe treatment of childhood-onset schizophrenia.\nSearch Strategy\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials\nRegister (February 2007), inspected references of all iden-\ntified studies for further trials, and contacted relevant\npharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for addi-\ntional information.\nSelection Criteria\nWe included all randomized clinical trials involving\nchildren and young people with a diagnosis of childhood-\nonset schizophrenia (ie, with a diagnosis of schizophre-\nnia before the age of 13) comparing any antipsychotic\ndrug with another antipsychotic or placebo.\nData Collection and Analysis\nStudies were reliably selected, quality assessed, and data\nextracted. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calcu-\nlated random effects, relative risk (RR) and its 95% con-\nfidence interval (CI), and, where appropriate, number\nneeded to treat on an intention-to-treat basis. For normal\ncontinuous data, we calculated the weighted mean\ndifference (WMD).\nMain Results\nFrom a total of 2062 citations, 6 relevant trials were iden-\ntified. These studies were small (total N = 256 partici-\npants) and short (all duration 12 weeks or less) and\nreported data for 3 comparisons (atypical vs. typical,\natypical vs atypical, and typical vs. typical antipsychotic\ndrugs), only one of which (atypical vs. typical) was to sug-\ngest differences between treatment groups.\nA few results from one study favored the atypical\nantipsychotic clozapine over haloperidol for treating\ntreatment-resistant childhood-onset schizophrenia (n = 21,\nWMD children\u2019s global assesment scale 17.00, CI 7.74\u2013\n26.26; n = 21, WMD Bunney-Hamburg Psychosis Rating\nScale \u00013.60, CI \u00016.64 to \u00010.56). Participants on cloza-\npine, however, were 3 times more likely to have drowsi-\nness (1 randomized controlled trial [RCT], n = 21, RR 3.3,\nCI 1.2\u20138.9, number needed to harm 2, CI 2\u201317) and half\nof the children receiving clozapine in this small short\nstudy experienced neutropenia (1 RCT, n = 21, RR 12,\nCI 0.75\u2013193; figure 1).\nReviewers\u2019 Conclusions\nThere are few relevant trials and, presently, little conclu-\nsive evidence regarding the effects of antipsychotic med-\nication for those with the rare but difficult problem of\nvery early-onset schizophrenia. Some benefits were iden-\ntified in using the atypical antipsychotic clozapine com-\npared with haloperidol, but the benefits were offset by an\nincreased risk of serious adverse effects.\nImplications for Practice\nAs yet there are few data to support the use of one an-\ntipsychotic medication over another in the treatment\nof schizophrenia with onset in childhood. The superiority\nof atypical antipsychotic medications over typical anti-\npsychotic drugs is not reflected in studies using typical\nmedications such as chlorpromazine as the comparator\nmedication, rather than haloperidol. Routine practice\nmay be best within the context of an evaluative trial.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed; tel: 0207-435-\n7111, fax: 0207-447-3733, e-mail: EKennedy@tavi-port.nhs.uk.\nSchizophrenia Bulletin vol. 33 no. 5 pp. 1082\u20131083, 2007\ndoi:10.1093\/schbul\/sbm080\nAdvance Access publication on August 1, 2007\n\u0001 The Author 2007.
