However,\nthe last decade has seen some significant changes in both the structure of teaching\ndepartments and the types of courses they deliver. This paper, delivered by Martin\nDe Saulles at the 39th Annual BIALL Conference held in Dublin in June 2008,\noutlines some of the pressures currently facing the library and information\nprofession and describes how teaching departments have responded in terms of\ncourse developments.\nKeywords: library schools; information work; courses\nIntroduction\nJust as the library and information profession is going\nthrough significant changes, so too are the university\ndepartments which deliver courses in this area.\nInformation and communication technologies, particularly\nthe internet, have been responsible for many of these\nchanges and information professionals require a broader\nrange of technical skills than was often the case in the past.\nThe challenge for those delivering courses at both under-\ngraduate and postgraduate level is to incorporate these\nnew requirements into the curriculum, without neglecting\nsome of the core skills in the areas of information literacy\nand collection management. The following paragraphs will\nattempt to explore in more detail some of these issues and\nexplain how, at the University of Brighton, we have been\nadapting to the digital information age.\nCurrent teaching of library\nand information courses\nThere are currently 17 universities in the United Kingdom\nthat teach library and information courses, split between\n52 postgraduate and 10 undergraduate awards. Two of the\ndominant trends amongst these institutions over the pre-\nvious 10 to 15 years has been a merging of library and\ninformation departments with other university depart-\nments, often computing, and a closing down of undergradu-\nate courses. Driving these changes has been a combination\nof falling student numbers and increasing pressure from\nuniversity management for greater operating efficiencies. In\nsome cases, universities have stopped teaching in this area\naltogether. The University of Central England stopped\nenrolling new students to its courses in 2005.\nReasons for decline in student\nnumbers\nMy institution, the University of Brighton, has not been\nimmune to these pressures and we stopped enrolling\nnew students on our two undergraduate awards in 2007.\nIn our case, the ever decreasing numbers of applicants\nmeant it was not viable to run these courses. This was a\nvery difficult decision, as we have been teaching library\nand information courses since 1947 through our prede-\ncessor technical colleges. However, we decided instead\nto focus our efforts on our successful postgraduate\ncourses which have a record of recruiting well. These\ndevelopments lead to the question of why taught under-\ngraduate courses in this subject area were not recruiting\nwell, particularly as total undergraduate student numbers\nhave been steadily increasing in recent years. I suspect\nthere are several key reasons for this:\n\u2022 The library profession has an image problem amongst\nyoung people with many of them attracted to the\nplethora of more \u201csexy\u201d vocational courses, such as\ntourism management, media production or public\nrelations. Fifteen years ago most of these courses did\nnot exist and the options for course selection for\n18 year olds was far less;\n267\n\u2022 Pay rates for new graduate library and information\nprofessionals in much of the public sector are very\nlow and the introduction of increased student fees has\nmade it more difficult to pay off student loans;\n\u2022 Qualification inflation means that more employers are\ndemanding postgraduate qualifications for entry\npositions. This often means a first degree in a specific\nsubject area and a postgraduate degree in library and\ninformation studies;\n\u2022 Employees are finding it increasingly difficult to secure\nfunding from their employers, as well as taking time\noff for undertaking courses on a part-time basis.\nDistance learning courses, such as those offered by\nAberystwyth, have succeeded in attracting students\nwho would, in previous years, have taken a course at a\nlocal college or university.\nSituation at University\nof Brighton\nAt the same time as deciding to wind down our under-\ngraduate courses, we decided to take another look at\nour postgraduate courses to make sure they were still\nrelevant to the needs of the library and information pro-\nfession. At the time we offered three courses:\n\u2022 MA Information Studies \u2013 aimed at graduates wishing\nto start a career in the profession. The course\ncomprised of a set of core modules that provided\nstudents with the essential skills required to take up a\nfirst professional post;\n\u2022 MA Information Management \u2013 designed for current\ninformation professionals with at least several years\nexperience who want to extend and update their\nskills;\n\u2022 MA Health Informatics \u2013 aimed at library and\ninformation professionals working in the health sector\nand wishing to develop their skills.\nThe MA Information Studies course has been consist-\nently successful at recruiting students with a regular\nintake of 20 to 30 new students a year. After a consul-\ntation with ex-graduates and employers, we decided to\nmaintain the course in its current state, working to the\nmaxim that if it\u2019s not broke don\u2019t fix it. However, the\nother two courses had seen a drop in student numbers\nin recent years and, following a consultation with a\nnumber of library and information professionals both in\nthe UK and abroad, we decided that elements of these\ncourses required altering. The key changes that we felt\nwere necessary centred around the technological changes\nthat were, and are still, taking place in the profession. It is\nno news to anyone working with information that the\nubiquity of the personal computer and the internet are\nfundamentally changing the ways people, not just infor-\nmation professionals, find, consume and use information.\nWhilst our two post-experience courses described above\nincorporated elements of this technological revolution,\nwe realised that, even over the previous five years,\nchanges in the way information is managed required us to\nmake substantial changes to those courses.\nDesign of new courses\nOne of the key findings from our consultation exercise\nwas that library and information professionals were aware\nof the technical changes taking place around them, but\nwanted a course that would help them understand these\nchanges and be able to apply this understanding within\nthe context of their work. Most of our students on the\nMA Information Management and MA Health Informatics\ncourses were part-time and worked in a range of infor-\nmation roles. This range of roles also played a part in the\nredesign of the courses, as we were seeing fewer students\nfrom the more traditional public and academic library\nroles and more from a broader cross-section of the infor-\nmation profession. Many of these roles involved more\ntechnical responsibilities, such as intranet and database\nmanagement, as well as the design and management of\ncontent management systems. It was becoming clear that\nshowing students how to construct a basic web site using\nHTML was no longer sufficient. Understanding content\nmanagement platforms such as Sharepoint, Drupal and\nWordpress was of more relevance, as database driven\nsites were beginning to take over from the flat HTML\nstructures which dominated the early days of the web.\nAs a consequence of this understanding we increased\nthe number of elective options available to students with\nnew modules in Information Architecture for the Web,\nInnovations in Online Information, Managing Knowledge\nand Collection Development in the Digital Age. We also\nchanged the status of the awards from MA to MSc,\nreflecting the technical additions to the courses. Finally,\nwe have responded to a recurring theme from our con-\nsultation which was to make the courses more work-\nfriendly. Most of our students hold down full-time jobs\nwhile studying part-time, and juggling these roles along\nwith family commitments is often very difficult.\nConsequently, the attendance for the modules on these\nnew MSc courses takes place over 3 consecutive days\nwhich most students find easier than having to do\nmodules that are spread out over the year. The new\ncourses were launched in 2007 and the response from\napplicants has so far been very positive.\nChallenges and opportunities in\nthe future of information work\nThe above is an explanation of how we, at the University\nof Brighton, have responded to the changes taking place\nin the library and information profession, largely driven\nby new technologies and increasing work pressures. How\nMartin De Saulles\n268\nsuccessful these changes will be remains to be seen. We\nsee course development as an iterative process of\nengagement with employers and potential students to\nunderstand their needs, as well as using our understand-\ning of technical change and innovation to anticipate\nwhere our profession may be going in the future. The\nremainder of this paper will present a personal view,\nbased on my experience as an academic and a prac-\ntitioner, of some of the key challenges and opportunities\nI see in terms of the future of information work.\nOver the previous 40 or so years there has been a fairly\nsteady flow of literature, from academics and practitioners,\non the state of the library profession and its prospects for\nthe future. These range from the apocalyptic - where the\nfuture has no need for librarians - to the optimistic vision\nthat sees information professionals at the heart of the\n\u201cinformation society\u201d into which we are inevitably heading.\nIn the middle is the more often presented view that library\nand information professionals have a great future, if only\nthey would come out from behind their issue desks and be\nmore proactive in the services they offer.\nI would argue that all these scenarios are too simplis-\ntic and fail to acknowledge the range of organisations\nwhich utilise and offer information services, as well as\nthe huge differences between those working in the pro-\nfession. Through personal experience I know there are\nstill some people who wish to work in libraries because\nthey \u201clike books\u201d and want a quiet life. However, the\nreality of library work, as they soon find out, is very\ndifferent, requiring a range of social and technical skills.\nFrom public and academic libraries to specialist infor-\nmation centres operating in the private sector, technol-\nogy is changing the way information is produced,\ndistributed and consumed and, more importantly, chan-\nging the expectations of users of these information ser-\nvices. Public libraries have responded to these changes\nwith the provision of internet access via the People\u2019s\nNetwork initiative and the re-branding of some libraries\nas Ideas Stores, reflecting their role as the provider of\nservices beyond the lending of books.\nHowever, as increasing numbers of households have\nbroadband connections (currently over 60% according to\nthe latest Ofcom figures) more people choose to buy their\nbooks online and public information services can be pro-\nvided via the internet, how relevant will public libraries be\nin five years time? Academic libraries are facing similar chal-\nlenges with students and academics increasingly using the\nonline services provided by the library, rather than actually\nvisiting the building itself. As e-books become more\ncommon and digital replaces paper for a range of infor-\nmation services, the physical presence of a library will\nbecome less important than the way it integrates these\nnew services into the learning experience of students and\nworking practices of academics. These changes are not\nrestricted to the public sector and impact on anyone\nproviding information services in any type of organisation.\nIt is this change from a physical and paper-based\nenvironment to a more virtual and digital one that\npresents the greatest threats, as well as opportunities, for\nlibrary and information professionals. As the building or\nphysical location of a library becomes less important, so\ndoes the visibility of those who work in it. The danger of\nbeing out of sight and, as a consequence, out of mind, is\na real one and may be exacerbated in these times of\ntighter budgets and credit squeezes. However, in my\nview, it is this threat that also offers the greatest opportu-\nnities for the profession.\nAs end-users increasingly expect, and are expected,\nto find their own information rather than relying on\nlibrarians to do the job for them, there is an opportunity\nfor many information professionals to redefine their roles\nand play a more central role in the operations of their\nemploying organisations. I am not just referring to the\nincreasing tendency for information workers to provide\ntraining for end-users in the areas of information retrie-\nval, although this is also an opportunity for increasing\none\u2019s relevance to one\u2019s employer. I am thinking more\nabout taking back some of the ground which has been\ncolonised by our colleagues in the computing depart-\nment. I sense a slowly increasing awareness within some\norganisations that despite all the large investments in\ninformation technology over the previous 20 or so years,\nthere has not been a corresponding increase in pro-\nductivity. This paradox has been recognised for many\nyears amongst the academic community, which has\nstudied these investments, but it now also seems to be\nentering the consciousness of managers who have to\nwrite the cheques for new computer networks, servers,\nPCs and the software that they run. Despite all the talk\nabout the transformative power of information technol-\nogy, the focus has for too long been on the \u201ctechnology\u201d\nand not so much the \u201cinformation\u201d. A symptom of this\nhas been the creation of the Chief Information Officer\nrole in many large organisations, but with the vast\nmajority of people filling those roles coming from com-\nputing, not information, backgrounds.\nConclusion\nI see a great opportunity for information professionals,\nwho can combine their knowledge of information man-\nagement with an understanding of the emerging technical\ninfrastructure, to play a more strategic role in the man-\nagement of their organisations. As digital networks and\ndigital information become ever more central to organis-\nations, both public and private, this opportunity for\nhybrid roles will become more apparent. We have cer-\ntainly tried to reflect these changes in our courses at the\nUniversity of Brighton and look forward to playing a role\nin the changes yet to come.\nAnyone wishing to know more about our teaching at\nthe University of Brighton can visit our blog \u2013 www.\ninformationmatters.net \u2013 or email the author, Martin\nDe Saulles on mrd@brighton.ac.uk\n269\nThe Future of Information Work\nBiography\nDr Martin De Saulles is a Principal Lecturer at the University of Brighton where he teaches and carries out research\non information law, knowledge management and online innovation.

Can social networking technologies enhance our\nproductivity, or are they time-wasters in a professional environment? In this article,\nbased on his paper given at the 39th Annual BIALL Conference held in Dublin in\nJune 2008, Stephen Weiter attempts to answer these questions.\nKeywords: social networking; internet; law librarians\nIntroduction\nFor the past few years I have heard presentations and read\nnumerous articles on Web 2.0 technologies and specifi-\ncally, social networking sites and their applicability to law\nlibrary services. There seems to be unanimity of opinion\nthat social networking sites and other aspects of what we\ncall \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d offer great opportunities for reaching our\npatrons and for expanding our services. Many of these\narticles and presentations also attest to the \u201ctechnological\nsavvy\u201d of younger professionals in our field, and contrast\nthat to the stale, unbending \u201cbaby-boomers\u201d who have\ncome to represent the staid institutional \u201cfear of change\u201d\ngroup among legal information professionals. The pro-\nfessional literature, blogs, and forums all seem to indicate\nthat \u201cwe should all be using these tools but we aren\u2019t and\nwe can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d\nRather than provide an overview and catalog of Web\n2.0 social technologies, this article will explore the current\nadaptations of social networking technologies and their\nuses. I will also discuss who will (or will not) implement\nthese technologies, and why (or why not), in a professional\nlegal information setting. I will also discuss the supposed\ngenerational divide in an effort to uncover attitudes about\nthese technologies and what types of institutions\/infor-\nmation centres will likely be early adopters of new technol-\nogies, and which types are likely to lag behind.
