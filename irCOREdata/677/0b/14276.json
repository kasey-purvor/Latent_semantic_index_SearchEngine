They emphasized the need\nfor co-operation between academics and librarians in database training and in\ncoursework where databases would be used. We report a project on students' use of\nbibliographic databases. Our findings reveal that access to these databases, whilst solving\nmany of the problems students experience in sourcing reference material for coursework\nand research, raises new intellectual problems due to the sheer breadth and depth of their\ncoverage of subject matter. Typically database training programmes focus on search skills\nand the use of different interfaces. However, our findings demonstrate that students should\nbe encouraged to develop a more critical perspective on databases since these can be\nseductive, time-consuming and, in certain circumstances, counterproductive resources.\nStudents would benefit from more guidance on the quality cues that academics and\nlibrarians employ when evaluating different databases and their contents.\nIntroduction\nAccess to bibliographic databases, online and on CD-ROM, is advantageous for the academic\ncommunity (East, 1993; Squires, 1993). Developments in communications and information\ntechnology mean that students, as well as academic staff, now have direct access to these\ndatabases (Tenopir and Ennis, 1998). This permits them to access a wider range of journal\narticles for research and project work than is usually available in a university library. There is\nan additional pay-off for business studies students since they have opportunities to develop the\ndatabase search and retrieval skills they will need when they enter business and the professions\n(Taylor, 1996; Wisendanger, 1994). In some professions, such as law and public relations,\naccess to specialist databases is essential to undertaking certain types of professional work\n(Taylor, 1996). Graduates who know where to locate information and how to access, retrieve\nand use information are valuable assets to employers.\nTraditionally the main drawbacks of online databases have been the costs and the skills required\nto use them. As a result universities have limited access to those trained in database search\n57\nMiriam Catterall and Pat Ibbotson Issues \u00a1n student training and use of electronic bibliographic databases\nskills, usually subject librarians. As more electronic information services are provided on CD-\nROM and via the World Wide Web, direct access to databases can be granted more widely\nthroughout the organization and time spent on individual and intuitive searches is no longer a\nkey direct cost issue.\nDatabase training initiatives aimed at students are reported in the literature, mainly from library\nprofessionals and in the context of North American universities (Neuman, 1995; Tenopir and Ennis,\n1998; Tenopir, 1998). Librarians and information specialists offer most of the training for students\nand they tend to concentrate on issues of access and retrieval. Specifically, training programmes\nconcentrate on how to use the different interfaces, identify keywords, employ Boolean operators\nand so on (Azzaro and Cleary, 1994; Webb, 1998). Whilst these basic skills are important, students\nneed to be made aware of other issues involved in using bibliographic databases.\nAt least two additional sets of issues need to be considered. The first set relates to the efficacy\nof the databases themselves. The availability of electronic bibliographic databases for academic\nresearch is often perceived as offering such clear advantages over traditional hard copy\nabstracting services and journals that there is a temptation to view them uncritically. Their\nconvenience and speed at performing searches tend to deflect attention away from both the ease\nof using them and their contents. There is considerable variation between databases on factors\nsuch as the user-friendliness of their interfaces, journal coverage, coverage of subject matter,\nincorrect citations and typographical errors (Grzeszkiewicz and Hawbaker, 1996).\nThe second set of issues relates to the skills required to use electronic databases effectively.\nMost training programmes focus on search and retrieval skills. Arguably, these skills are the\nmeans to achieving a particular end, namely the evaluation and appropriate use of the\ninformation retrieved. As students move from manual to electronic searches they encounter a\nnew situation, information overload (Tenopir, 1998). We know little about how this impacts on\ntheir intellectual decisions such as the criteria that they employ to evaluate the information\nretrieved. Furthermore, most problems in academic, business and professional spheres do not\ncome labelled as problems and considerable problem definition and delimitation may be\nrequired. The difficulties involved in delimiting problems can be exacerbated when there is a\nsurfeit of information.\nIn this article we report on a project designed to provide opportunities for students to identify\nand reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of using electronic bibliographic databases. We\ndescribe the project briefly below and go on to discuss the findings. The findings from the\nproject have forced us to rethink the training and support students need to use databases\neffectively. They have also influenced the ways that we set guidelines for assessing coursework\nwhen bibliographic databases are used.\nProject description\nThe project was designed to encourage students to become more critical users of electronic\nbibliographic databases; a need that is recognized by many library professionals (Tenopir and\nEnnis, 1998) and academic staff (David and Zeitlyn, 1996). The project was incorporated into\nthe, coursework requirements for market research modules. Market researchers place\nconsiderable emphasis on using secondary data sources, including databases, to help solve\nclients' problems. Thus, coursework designed around the use and assessment of bibliographic\ndatabases was appropriate to the aims and content of the module.\n58\nAir-j Volume 7 Number 2\nStudents were asked to develop a bibliography for an essay that they were writing.\nSpecifications were set for the bibliography. It should be developed employing a variety of\nsources including OPACs, current and past volumes of printed journals, electronic bibliographic\ndatabases (primarily ANBAR and ABI INFORM) and abstracting services in hard copy format\n(including Market Research Society Abstracts and ANBAR). They received a brief training\nprogramme delivered by library staff before commencing work on the bibliography. This\nprogramme was designed specifically for business studies students and focused on the range of\ndatabases available, their different interfaces and some basic search skills.\nEach student was asked to submit a written account of their experiences with all the sources\nthey employed. They were asked to include a descriptive account of the activities involved in\ncompiling the bibliography including which sources of information were used and in what\norder, search terms employed, and hits achieved. They were requested to discuss any problems\nthey encountered and how these were addressed. Finally, they were asked to reflect on the\nbenefits and drawbacks of using databases and to compare the usefulness of the various sources\nthey used. We reported back to students on our analysis and interpretation of their written\naccounts and asked for their comments. This feedback and the discussion it stimulated provided\nfurther information for us and students found it useful to compare experiences.\nThe first cohort to participate in the project in 1994 consisted of 49 full-time students (29\nfemale and 20 male) in their final year of a business studies degree programme. These students\ndid not have access to electronic bibliographic databases prior to their final year. During 1995\nthe project was extended to include part-time students and postgraduate marketing students.\nThe design of the project remained largely unaltered until 1998 when our teaching\nresponsibilities for undergraduate classes ended.\nSince the project commenced in 1994 we have had an opportunity to identify how students' use\nof these resources alter as they gain more experience of using them. Monitoring change was\nimportant, as access to databases has improved over the years. When the project began the\nrange of electronic databases available to our students was limited to abstract (ABI INFORM)\nand citation databases (FirstSearch). These were available in CD-ROM format and could only\nbe accessed in the university library. During 1997 the library subscribed to full text\nbibliographic databases including European Business ASAP and, later, ProQuest. These are\naccessed via the World Wide Web, which means that students can use them from any networked\nuniversity computer.\nProject findings\nStudents' written accounts provided considerable detail relevant to a range of issues. We report\nthe findings that relate to problems that can result from a surfeit of information and judging the\nrelevance and quality of this information. We begin by reporting how the first cohort of students\ntackled the project and then go on to discuss how this has altered with successive student\ncohorts.\nSearch and evaluation process\nOur analysis of written accounts revealed considerable similarities in the search procedures\nstudents employed. The typical search process consists of various stages and there is\nconsiderable iteration between and within these stages.\n59\nMiriam Catterall and Pat Ibbotson Issues in student training and use of electronic bibliographic databases\nStage 1: Initial forays\nStudents searched the electronic databases first in preference to other sources such as current\nand past volumes of journals and abstracting services in hard copy format. Whilst students\ndescribed these first searches as unproductive in locating suitable references, it was clear that\nthey were productive in terms of learning how to use databases and in identifying the need to\nclarify exactly what you are looking for.\nKeywords for these early searches were drawn from the essay titles, usually resulting in\nsearches that were either too broad, resulting in huge numbers of references, or, too narrow\nresulting in no references at all. A search using the keyword 'ethics' resulted in hundreds of hits\nfrom ABIIFORM. By contrast the keywords 'group discussion ethics' resulted in no hits at all.\nWhen unfamiliar with the essay topic, as most students are at this stage, keywords are exhausted\nvery quickly. Whilst hits that are definitely irrelevant to the topic can be spotted quite easily,\nstudents are not in a position to evaluate the relevance of those that remain. It is at this point that\nthey identify the need to obtain more information on the essay topic before undertaking further\nsearches.\nStage 2: Defining problem parameters and focused searching\nStudents read the relevant chapters from textbooks to obtain a better understanding of the essay\ntopic and to identify potential keywords. Armed with a better understanding of the topic and\nnew keywords, they engage in more focused searching. These more focused searches produce\nhits that, in turn, suggest new avenues for further searches. The point at which to stop searching\nand make some decisions on which of the hits to retrieve in full text was not considered to be\nproblematic. Some students reported that diminishing returns set in; searches revealed few hits\nthat had not been obtained during earlier searches or from another database. Others stopped\nwhen they considered that they had a sufficient volume of hits, most of which they would\nprobably not use anyway.\nStage 3: Decision time\nHits that were definitely irrelevant to the essay topic had already been eliminated at Stage 1 and\nthe more focused searches at Stage 2 generated fewer of these. Even so, students may still be\nleft with a large volume of hits to be evaluated, all of which may be relevant to the essay topic.\nTwo approaches to evaluation emerged. Some students made decisions about their essay plan\nincluding which issues to make the focus of the essay and which ones to leave out. This\napproach considerably reduces the number of hits and may require further, even more focused,\nsearches. However, most students make their evaluation decisions based solely on whether or\nnot they can obtain the full text of the article. The availability of the article in the library is the\nkey factor in determining whether or not it will be accessed and read.\nThis search and retrieval protocol remained largely unaltered even though subsequent cohorts\nof students embarked on the project with some prior experience of using databases. Their\nwritten accounts offer some insight into the reasons why the search protocol remained unaltered\neven after the introduction of full text databases.\nDefining and delimiting problems\nSearching databases for information is a means to an end and unless the user has a clear end in\nsight, or a well-defined problem, information overload can be a significant problem. However,\nit is also the case that databases can provide the information that helps the user specify the\nproblem in the first place. Our description of the search protocol revealed this interplay between\n60\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nsearching and problem definition and delimitation. Thus, experienced users of electronic\ndatabases still engage in the initial foray stage described above and knowingly employ\nkeywords that will result in large numbers of 'unproductive' references. This is because the\ntitles of the hits generated can provide cues to the nature and scope of the topic they are\nresearching. These broad-brush searches can highlight the issues or themes that are the subject\nof the most recent publications on a topic. They also provide cues to which journals to search\nand authors who publish frequently on the topic.\nOf course students still report problems with regard to problem definition. Some students\nreferred to their 'pre-database' essay preparation in terms such as 'blissful ignorance', 'naive'\nand 'superficial'. Scouring the library shelves for essay material can be a hit and miss affair.\nFinding any material at all by this type of browsing was considered a small victory and the\nmaterial that was retrieved was employed liberally in the essay, even though its quality may not\ndeserve such focus. With access to bibliographic databases these problems reduce, but different\nproblems arise. In our experience, few undergraduate students employed abstracts in hard copy\nbefore we initiated this project. Usually, they would identify material for essays from references\nin textbooks and in any journal articles they accessed. In turn, these sources would be used to\nidentify yet more references. The availability of databases has eased much of the manual burden\nand time involved in searching for references; however, the intellectual burden has increased.\nAccess to abstract and full text databases has encouraged students to use these resources. At the\nsame time, these databases have revealed the sheer volume, range and diversity of reference\nmaterial on a topic.\nJudging database quality\nDatabases can be evaluated on the ratio of relevant to irrelevant hits they generate on the\nproblem at hand and also on their inherent quality. Students' written accounts raised some\ninteresting questions on both these issues.\nStudents reported that the most useful references for their essays were found in the printed\nvolumes of a specialist market research abstracting service. Few references listed in this source\nwere eliminated as irrelevant. This is hardly a surprising finding since they were writing a\nmarket research essay. A specialist market research database would be expected to outperform\nmore generalist databases such as ABI INFORM on the criterion of relevance. This led some\nstudents to question whether using electronic databases did in fact result in timesaving. Of\ncourse the key learning point for students is that there is a variety of databases available and\nstudents need to select the one(s) most appropriate to the problem at hand. This was an\nimportant point given that students preferred to use ABI INFORM, which was considered easier\nto use than ANBAR.\nStudents make their selection decisions based largely, and even solely, on the availability of the\nfull text versions of articles. When only abstract and citation databases were available, the\ndecision was based on whether they could obtain the full text of the article in the library. This\nreduced considerably the number of references that were considered. As full text databases\nbecame available, selection decisions altered somewhat. Most databases report the results of\nsearches by listing the most recent publications on a topic first. Students work back through the\nabstracts marking those that seem most relevant to their topic before downloading or printing\nthe full text versions. If there is a large number of relevant hits, students work back through the\nabstracts until they judge they have a 'manageable' number to work with. They operate on the\n61\nMiriam Catterall and Pot Ibbotson Issues in student training and use of electronic bibliographic databases\nbasis that even the most recent publications are likely to include references to important earlier\nworks, and these can be accessed at a later stage if necessary.\nStudents were asked to compare the various databases they used. Thus, it was not unusual to\nfind the same reference abstracted in different databases. Some abstract writers would\nemphasize issues not mentioned by others and, more significantly, some abstracts bore very\nlittle relation to what was contained in the full text of the article. This prompted questions on the\nextent to which users can rely on abstracts.\nStudents also identified and questioned issues of editorial policy and coverage. Some articles\nare referenced in one abstract database but not in another that abstracts the same journal. In a\nsimilar vein, comparisons of full text databases revealed that items available in one journal\nissue were not available in the same issue in another database, raising questions as to what\nexactly full text means. Indeed one of the main findings to emerge from this ongoing project is\nthat students who had access only to abstract databases on CD-ROM demonstrated a more\ncritical attitude to all of the sources that they used. The most recent cohorts of students who had\naccess to full text databases on the World Wide Web were also able to identify some weaknesses\nin the various sources but, for the most part, did not consider them a problem since they are\noften spoilt for choice of material.\nDiscussion\nWhat we have learned from students' accounts of using bibliographic databases raises issues on\nthe content and delivery of database training and support for students who use them. It also\nraises issues for teachers who set and assess coursework for these student users. We discuss\nthese issues in more detail below.\nDelivery of training\nThe literature on this subject reveals that the responsibility for training rests largely with library\nand information technology staff. University librarians are already under considerable pressure\nin their instructional role. Tenopir and Ennis (1998) found that over the past decade university\nreference librarians had increased substantially the time they spent on formal and informal\ninstructional sessions with students as a result of the rapid and widespread adoption of electronic\nmedia. The authors point out that this situation is exacerbated by the fact that student needs have\nbecome increasingly diverse with some students requiring very basic instruction and other more\nexperienced users requiring advanced instruction, say, on synthesizing the results of searches.\nThe potential problems involved in relying mainly or only on library professionals are\nhighlighted by Meadow, Wang and Yuan (1995). They found that search process specialists and\nsubject matter specialists differ in the ways they implement database searches. Similarly, David\nand Zeitlvn (1996) found that even in domains where databases are heavily used for research,\nacademics often rely more on specialist sources than the more generalist sources available in\nuniversity libraries. Indeed some of their respondents claimed that electronic databases\nencouraged a 'scatter-gun' approach to searching. They were useful only for stimulating ideas\nand could in fact be counterproductive. Thus, students could be receiving mixed messages\nabout databases from academics and library professionals.\nOttewill and Hudson (1997) made a case for both library staff and academic staff to be involved\nand to co-operate in training students on how to use databases, and the research reported here\n62\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nsupports their case. Academics could co-operate with and support the efforts of library staff in a\nnumber of ways that would benefit both parties and, most importantly, their students.\nContent of training\nThe content of training programmes tends to focus on what databases are available, how to use\nthe various interfaces and the development of search and retrieval skills. Electronic databases\nwith the sheer volume of content and their apparent advantages in convenience and speed of\nsearching can be very seductive, leading students to reject other more (apparently) time-\nconsuming sources of material. For this reason it is important that training initiatives\nincorporate a more critical assessment of them which, at a minimum, should include discussion\nof the criteria against which all sources of material might be judged. Here the criterion of\nrelevance is of prime importance. Ideally, training initiatives will include some practical\nexercises to illustrate relevance problems and how these might be addressed. This is especially\nimportant since many of the electronic databases that university libraries subscribe to are\ngeneralist rather than specialist and aimed at multiple users. FirstSearch and European Business\nASAP are aimed at users from all disciplines and all management disciplines respectively.\nTeachers could help in the design of exercises relevant to their subject areas.\nOther evaluation criteria need to be discussed in training programmes. As university libraries\nsubscribe to a greater variety of databases, we need to make more explicit to our students the\ndifferences in database efficacy. This would include factors such as their journal coverage, what\nthe provider means by full-text, proneness to errors and so on. Here library staff and academics\ncould co-operate by sharing knowledge on databases that can subsequently be passed on to\nstudents. Most electronic databases provide abstracts or full text articles from the mid-late\n1980s. Some seminal articles on a topic may predate these databases. Although this may seem a\nvery obvious observation, many of our students discovered it only after they had tried\nunsuccessfully to access some reading list articles dated prior to the late 1980s. Since students\nprefer to work only or mainly with full text databases, many academics are expressing concern\nabout 'the loss of knowledge caused by the great electronic divide' (Peek, 1998). Teachers may\nneed to emphasize the message that recent is not always best.\nCoursework\nDirect access to databases has revealed the sheer volume of material available on a topic and,\nmore significantly, the range and complexity of issues involved in a topic. A key issue for\nstudents is how this range and complexity can be represented or reduced to meet the\nrequirements of a word-limited essay. Is it better to select one or a few of the issues associated\nwith the essay topic and discuss these in depth or to consider the range of issues, perhaps\nsacrificing depth? Faced with increasing numbers of students asking these questions, we\nrecognized at an early stage in this project that we would need to give more consideration to\nhow we select and design essay titles and specifications.\nFor some students, particularly postgraduates, setting coursework assignments that do not\ndefine too precisely the problem to be addressed provides them with opportunities to experience\nthe delimitation problems that academic researchers and decision-makers face. This can be built\ninto the assignment specification that students receive. For example, it can be listed as one of\nthe assignment objectives and as an assessment criterion. For other students, particularly\nundergraduates, the assignment set may need to be more tightly specified in terms of its focus\nand scope. To illustrate, we could indicate that we were looking for a range of issues to be\n63\nMiriam Catterall and Pat (bbotson Issues in student training and use of electronic bibliographic databases\ndiscussed, e.g. 'discuss the issues companies need to consider when designing a test market', or\na single issue in depth, e.g. 'select and discuss in detail one of the issues facing companies when\ndesigning test markets'.\nLarge generalist bibliographic databases include refereed journals, non-refereed journals and trade\nand professional publications. Marketing News, a trade journal, is available alongside the Journal\nof Marketing, a high-quality research journal, and both are publications of the American\nMarketing Association. As teachers we need to alert students to quality cues we employ as\nacademic researchers. Often these cues are so taken for granted that we assume our students will\nknow them. For example, if the full text article does not contain any references then it may not be\nworth downloading or printing it. We noted that when faced with a large volume of 'relevant'\nreferences our students start with the most recently published and work back until they consider\nthey have retrieved a sufficient volume of material. In certain areas of marketing, students may\nhave to work back through many pages of hits before locating the first refereed journal article.\nOf course, it is not always the case that articles from high-quality refereed journals are the most\nuseful for a particular piece of coursework. However, we do need to inform students of the kind\nof references we expect them to source for individual pieces of coursework. To illustrate, non-\nreferred and trade publications such as Campaign may be appropriate where students are to\nundertake a review of current advertising practice, but not for a critical review of advertising\ntheories. By contrast, a comparison of the current issues puzzling advertising practitioners and\nacademics may require the perusal of a wider range of sources.\nConclusions\nElectronic databases, online, CD-ROM and the World Wide Web are a useful and necessary\nresource for academics and for those working in business and the professions. The ability to use\nthem well will be advantageous for students as they seek employment in business and the\nprofessions. However, they need to be aware of the wider issues associated with the use of these\nseductive resources: to learn to choose databases carefully and to use them critically. The wider\nissues associated with database use, relevance and coverage (or lack of it) are issues as important\nas how to use particular interfaces or construct lists of keywords. We have tended to see training\nas something that is the responsibility of library and information specialists. However, our own\nand other research suggests that academic staff need to play a greater role here.\nDirect student access to a wider range and diversity of journals means that teaching staff need to\nrethink implications of this for student coursework. Students would benefit from more guidance\non the quality cues that academics and librarians employ when assessing the usefulness of\ndifferent databases and when evaluating the individual references they contain. The evaluation\nof individual references refers not only to their inherent quality, such as the quality of the\njournal, but also their relevance to the problem. Students using databases can find themselves\nwith huge lists of references without having thought through issues of scope and focus for the\nproblem at hand. The process of defining and delimiting problems is an important intellectual\nskill in academic research and in business and professional practice. Access to electronic\ndatabases, particularly the generalist databases, may complicate rather than simplify problems.\nThe power and potential of electronic databases are not in question. However, if they are to be\nused effectively by all our students greater care must be given to their integration into the\ncurriculum.\n64\nALT-] Volume 7 Number 2\nReferences\nAzzaro, S. and Cleary, K.
