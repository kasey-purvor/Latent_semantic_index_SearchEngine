She is author or editor of eleven books \nand 100+ academic articles and chapters on media audiences, children and the internet, \ndomestic contexts of media use and media literacy. Recent books include Audiences and \nPublics (Intellect, 2005), The Handbook of New Media (edited, with Leah Lievrouw, Sage, \n2006), and The International Handbook of Children, Media and Culture (edited, with Kirsten \nDrotner, Sage, 2008). She was President of the International Communication Association \n2007-8. \n \nAbstract: \n \nThe quintessential image of the television audience is of the family viewing at home \u2013sitting \ntogether comfortably in front of the lively set. Accompanying this happy image is its negative \u2013 \na child viewing alone while real life goes on elsewhere. This chapter reviews evidence over \nfive decades regarding the changing place of television in children\u2019s lives. It argues that, \nnotwithstanding post-war trends that have significantly changed adolescence, the family \nhome and wider consumer society, there was time for the 1950s family experiment to spawn \nthe 1960s and 1970s family television experiment, thereby shaping normative expectations \u2013 \nacademic, policy and popular - regarding television audiences for years to come. At the turn \nof the twenty-first century, we must recognise that it was the underlying long-term trend of \nindividualisation, and its associated trends of consumerism, globalisation and the \ndemocratisation that, historically and now, more profoundly frame the place of television in the \nfamily. \n 2 \nTelevision and the family: What do we want to know? \nThe quintessential image of the television audience is of the family viewing at home \u2013 children \nand parents sitting together comfortably in front of the lively set. Accompanying this happy image \nis its negative \u2013 a child viewing alone, square-eyed and trance-like, while real life goes on \nelsewhere. The former image was quickly popularised by broadcasting industries in many \nWestern countries after the Second World War. It represents the hope of shared pleasure that \nmotivated the public to purchase and install this new technology as quickly as they could afford \nto do so (Butsch, 2000; Spigel, 1992). The latter image, reproduced by newspapers, parenting \nmagazines and public policy pronouncements, represents the fear that motivated funding for \nempirical research by social science designed to investigate television\u2019s potentially harmful \neffects (Rowland, 1983; Wartella & Reeves, 1985). So, who was right? Can we, after half a \ncentury or so of television in our homes and, furthermore, half a century or so of research, \nidentify what difference television made to \u2018the family\u2019? \nThe moral panics associated with the arrival of each new medium, which demand that research \naddresses the same questions over and again - about the displacement of reading, exercise and \nconversation, about social isolation and addiction, about violent and consumerist content (Barker \n& Petley, 2001) - have a long history. Bettelheim (1999) traces them back via Goethe\u2019s \u2018The \nSorrows of Young Werther\u2019, blamed for a wave of suicides in 18th century Germany, to Plato\u2019s \nideal state that banned imaginative literature for corrupting the young. But what this makes plain \nis that society\u2019s perennial anxieties about children, childhood and the family, are catalysed by \n\u2018the new\u2019, the popular hope being that by fixing the technology, society could fix the problems of \nchildhood. However, a critical rejection of both moral panics and technological determinism does \nnot permit us to conclude that television played no role in the unfolding history of the family in the \ntwentieth century. Indeed, I am partly provoked to write this chapter by the notable absence of \nanswers to the \u2018so what?\u2019 question from the many scholars who, over the decades, have \nzealously charted the facts and figures on the prominence of television within the family.1 Surely, \ntelevision must have made some difference. Equally, surely family life would have been different \nwithout television or had television been itself different. \nTo avert the charge of technological determinism hovering in the minds of this volume\u2019s readers \n(MacKenzie & Wajcman, 1999), I stress that the starting point must be the recognition that \n\u2018television\u2019, both the domestic set and its broadcast forms and contents, was developed, \ndesigned, financed, regulated and marketed by the very society which then worried about the \nconsequences. Crucially, society has itself undergone profound changes over the past half \ncentury, so that television is just one of many factors that have influenced family life in the \nsecond half of the twentieth century. These changes include the urbanisation and education of \nthe population, the growing emancipation of women, the growth of affluent individualism and the \nrise of consumer society together with an increasingly dispossessed poor, the gradual inclusion \nof the diversity of the population in terms of ethnicity and sexuality, the decline in public \nparticipation and political commitment and, specifically relevant here, the post-traditional family \nand the \u2018discovery\u2019 of adolescence. Together, these factors have refashioned the family during \nthe twentieth century in the direction of individualisation and democratization, ever further away \nfrom the Victorian family (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002; Coontz, 1997; Gadlin, 1978); they \nhave therefore also shaped the context within which television was appropriated, acquiring a \nmeaningful place within \u2018the family\u2019.2  \nParallel changes in media and in childhood must be considered in tandem if we are to avoid \neither technological or cultural determinism. However, this short article can only sketch the \noutline of an analysis of television\u2019s place in the lives of parents and children and, in so doing, it \n                                                 \n1 I will not, here, review research on television\u2019s effects on individual attitudes and behaviours, except to \nnote the growing body of findings that, broadly, support the conclusion that television has cultivated certain \nassumptions, beliefs and mores in the population as a whole, reinforcing a normative status quo of \nconsumerism and do-it-yourself lifestyle identity, along with a mainstreaming of public opinion, and a fear of \ncrime, strangers and the unfamiliar (Millwood Hargrave & Livingstone, 2006). \n2 I take it as read that, as Hill and Tisdall (1997: 66) observe, \u2018the idea of family is to some degree a fluid \none, with a mix of concepts at its core \u2013 direct biological relatedness, parental caring role, long-term \ncohabitation, permanent belonging\u2019. Indeed, given limitations of space, I will not here stress the \ncomplex, multidimensional and historically-contingent nature of each \u2018family\u2019, \u2018childhood\u2019, \u2018youth\u2019, \n\u2018television\u2019 \u2013 but I hope the reader will not take this to mean that I intend them in any simple fashion. \n 3 \nmust rely on an even sketchier account of the major societal shifts during the past half century \nthat contextualise the \u2018arrival\u2019 of television. Specifically, I shall argue, first, that the coincidence of \nmass television in the 1950s and what Stephanie Coontz (1997) has called \u2018the 1950s family \nexperiment\u2019 meant that, although for a time the arrival of television signalled a temporary but \nculturally significant grouping of the family around the living room set (and the nation around the \nprime-time terrestrial schedules), historical evidence reveals that this only briefly bucks the \nlonger term trend towards the multiplication and diversification of media that has facilitated what \nPatrice Flichy (2002) calls \u2018living together separately\u2019 or, more abstractly, the processes of \nindividualisation, consumerism, and globalisation that characterise Western societies in late \nmodernity. \n \n\u2018Family television\u2019: An accident of history \nResearch conducted from the 1950s onwards, when television reached the mass market in many \nWestern countries, showed a collective \u2018coming together\u2019 of the family around the set, with \ndomestic living space being rearranged to create the \u2018family room\u2019 (i.e. television room; Spigel, \n1992) and the domestic timetable being adjusted to fit the television schedules (Scannell, 1988).3 \nCompared with those without television, Hilde Himmelweit and her colleagues found in 1955-6 \nthat children in television households were slightly more likely to stay indoors and to share both \ntime and interests with their parents. Television rapidly became children's main leisure activity, to \nsome extent displacing reading and 'doing nothing\u2019 and providing functionally equivalent leisure \nwith little detrimental effect on school work. Viewing figures quickly reached just under two hours \nper day (the greatest amount of time spent on any leisure activity; Himmelweit, Oppenheim & \nVince, 1958).4 From the early years of television, viewers spent less time alone and more time \nindoors with the family (though not necessarily talking to each other!), with television tending to \ndisplace going to the cinema and socializing with others (Andreasen, 1994; Katz & Gurevitch, \n1976; Robinson & Godbey, 1997). \nAlthough in the 1950s, family life and gender roles became unusually predictable and settled, \nthis was, as historical trends in social statistics show, \u2018a very short interlude that people \nmistakenly identify as \u201ctraditional\u201d\u2019 (Coontz, 1997: 54). I suggest that a similar misconception, \noccasioning a similar nostalgia, has become associated with \u2018the 1950s family experiment\u2019, \nnamely that of \u2018family television\u2019. For several decades, television has been seen as \u2013 and for \nmany people has been - what the family watched together, after father came home from work \nand when mother had finished tidying the house for the day. Television represented a key means \nby which father, by choosing to watch \u2018his\u2019 programmes, asserted his economic power, while \nmother, who regulated the children\u2019s viewing while father was at work, showed her moral \nproficiency in managing her family. Yet as Morley\u2019s (1986) account of \u2018family television\u2019 \nillustrated, fundamental tensions between genders and generations were often exacerbated \nrather than alleviated by these normative expectations regarding the family. \nIn short, \u2018family television\u2019 was more a popular ideal than an actuality. Himmelweit et al (1958) \nshowed that even in the 1950s, children stayed up \u2018too late\u2019 watching television, watching \n\u2018inappropriate\u2019 programmes and conflicting with their parents. Oswell (2002) adds that though \ntelevision was promoted as a joint activity for parents and children (consider the title of the \npopular British pre-school programme, Watch With Mother), it was widely understood as \nproviding a babysitter that allowed mother to do something else. In short, the signs of \nindividualisation as the dominant trend were already present. Interestingly, notwithstanding the \ndecades of research on whether the television was or was not beneficial for the family, it was \n                                                 \n3 Indeed, the marketing and design of television still seeks to shape family space and time to its \nexpectations \u2013 unusually for media both before and since. The home computer notoriously does not fit well \ninto the home, print media never sought to, and the radio quickly adjusted to fit people\u2019s schedules rather \nthan the other way around. \n4 This figure has risen today to nearly two and a half hours in the UK (Livingstone, 2002) and to three \nhours per day in the USA (Roberts, Foehr, & Rideout, 2005). I thank Friedrich Krotz for drawing to my \nattention to a German project published by Gerhard Maletke (1959) as Fernsehen im Leben der Jugend \n(Hamburg: Hand-Bredow Institut). As in the UK and USA (Schramm, Lyle, & Parker, 1961), this showed \nthat family viewing quickly reached 15-20 hours per week, a level from which subsequent research in \nWestern countries shows little increase (see also Broddason, 2006; Johnsson-Smaragdi, 1992). \n 4 \napparent from the outset that physically co-location does not guarantee emotional cohesiveness. \nIn a statement that one could still write today, Himmelweit et al (1958: 25) wrote: \n\u2018Television does keep members of the family at home more. But it is doubtful whether it \nbinds the family together more than in this physical sense, except while the children are \nyoung. As they grow older, their viewing becomes more silent and personal. Also, as \nchildren grow into adolescence, the increased time spent with the family may set up \nstrains, since it runs counter to their need to make contacts outside.\u2019 \nCompared with radio, which took children for granted within \u2018the family audience\u2019, its mode of \naddress asserting a unifying voice to bring the family together around the hearth, television \narrived when the trend towards individualisation was well underway (Oswell, 2002). Family \nmembers were dispersing around the home, developing diverse lifestyle tastes and identities, \npartly because of the coincidental arrival of central heating (though few public discourses attack \ncentral heating for breaking up the family!). Faced with the task of addressing an already \nheterogeneous audience, television drew more on the techniques of market research to \ndistinguish the child audience from the adult audience than it attempted to draw the generations \ntogether. Thus television has progressively distinguished \u2018kid\u2019, \u2018teen\u2019 and, later, \u2018toddler\u2019 and \n\u2018tween\u2019 market segments through programming form, content and style (Kenway & Bullen, 2008), \naddressing each as distinctive from each other and from adults, encouraging certain activities, \ninterests and even subversive joys (Seiter, 1993), while associating peer culture and youthful \nidentity with the messages of marketing, merchandising and distinction (Kline, 1993).5 \n \nLocating television in the longer history of individualisation \nIndividualisation6 refers to a social change with a much longer history than the half century \naddressed here: as early as the end of the seventeenth century, one could identify \u2018the \nprivatisation of families from each other, and the individualisation of members within families\u2019 \n(Luke, 1989: 39). But for young people, the change has been more recent, for the notion of \n\u2018teenager\u2019 emerged only in the 1950s (Abrams, 1959; France, 2007), this in turn resulting \nfrom the conjunction of several key changes - from children having a productive role in the \neconomy to that of children as consumers (Cunningham, 1995), the extension of formal \neducation from mid to late teens and a commensurate rise in the average age of leaving \nhome (France, 2007), and the advent of consumer culture that created youth culture to fill the \nnew space between childhood and adulthood (Osgerby, 1998).7 The consequence is not \nsimply the replacement of the traditional norms and values by which parents socialised their \nchildren (Gadlin, 1978) in favour of the peer group, but rather the emergence of the new \nresponsibility, namely \u2018the reflexive project of the self which consists in the sustaining of \ncoherent, yet continuously revised, biographical narratives\u2019 (Giddens, 1991: 5). Here the \nmedia play a key role, providing the resources for identity construction and display, and the \noccasions for negotiating and defining aspects of one\u2019s identity against the expressions of \nothers. \n                                                 \n5 Ironically, throughout the dominance of mass communication, popular fears regarding \u201ckids\u2019 culture\u201d \nstressed the homogenising effect of commercialisation; today, the more commercially-effective strategy \ncapitalises upon the process of individualisation, providing \u2013 and profiting from \u2013 fast-changing, niche \nmarkets and diversified taste cultures. Yet television\u2019s power has its limits: children and, especially, \nteenagers remain a notoriously hard market for either advertisers or broadcasters to reach; children still \ngenerally prefer to play with friends or ride their bikes than watch television (Livingstone, 2002), and when \nthey do watch, they reinterpret the meanings offered to them in ways that fit their own perceptions, such \nreinterpretation being sufficiently creative for the media industry itself to hire its \u2018cool hunters\u2019 and \nincorporate the inventions of youth culture in developing its own innovations (Jenkins, 2003). \n6 Individualisation refers to the thesis that traditional social distinctions (particularly social class) are \ndeclining in importance as determinants of people\u2019s (especially young people\u2019s) life course, resulting in a \nfragmentation of (or perhaps liberation from) traditional norms and values (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, \n2002). \n7 It is noteworthy that, although Himmelweit et al did not find television to have any impact on children\u2019s \naggression, they did find that those with television became more ambitious and middle class in their \naspirations and values, and girls also became more conformist in their desire to adopt feminine roles. \n 5 \nComparing the 1950s with the 1980s, Ziehe (1994: 2) argues that the new consumer \nopportunities of post war western societies were framed in terms of ambivalent desires for ever \nhigher domestic and personal living standards, resulting in \u2018an increasing orientation towards \nquestions of life style\u2019 that in turn became crystallised in the parallel discourses surrounding \nyouth, thereby encoding cultural change in terms of generational conflict. Ziehe stresses the \nimportance of music here, but for Osgerby, television was also crucial as it addresses young \npeople as distinctive in identity, lifestyle and attitudes, encouraging their construction of a leisure \ncareer that, being itself subject to pervasive market forces and peer pressures, is perceived by \nparents as making them \u2018grow up faster and earlier\u2019 (while postponing adult responsibilities for \nlonger). As Coontz (1997: 13) puts it, \u2018in some ways, childhood has actually been prolonged, if it \nis measured by dependence on parents and segregation from adult activities\u2019, and this \ndependence is in a state of tension with young people\u2019s growing autonomy in the realms of \nleisure, consumption, appearance, identity. It is this tension, surely, that is expressed in the \nconflicts of adolescence that are, in turn, so often expressed as conflicts over the use of media at \nhome. \nNot only \u2018children\u2019 and \u2018teenagers\u2019 but also \u2018the family\u2019 and \u2018television\u2019 have changed, co-evolving \n(Andreasen, 1994) through the post war decades. For many, family life in the 1950s was \nundoubtedly cohesive and stable, with sufficient affluence to fuel the consumer boom to which \nboth the birth of youth culture (Osgerby, 1998) and the golden age of television (Spigel, 1992) \nwere linked. While television diffused rapidly, rising in the US from 9% of households in 1950 to \n87% by 1960, the significant change over the next thirty years was not so much the saturation of \nthe market, though this occurred (with 98% of households having television by 1990), but rather \nthe growth of multi-set households. Along with the linked technologies (satellite and cable \nchannels, video cassette recorder, electronic games, etc), this transformed the home into a multi-\nmedia environment capable of supporting not only a shared interest in the nightly news, the \nnational soap opera or the Saturday film, but also the diverse and niche interests of each \nindividual separately. \nIn this manner, television followed the trend established for electronic media throughout the last \ncentury: the gramophone from the start of the twentieth century, the telephone from the 1920s, \nradio from the 1930s, television from the 1950s, the VCR from the 1970s, the computer from the \n1980s, and now the internet. Each has begun its career in the main collective family space of the \nliving room but, as prices fall and multiplication and mobility of goods becomes feasible, each \nhas moved into more individualised, personalised and, for children, unsupervised, spaces, \nparticularly the bedroom but also the study, play room and kitchen, thereby spreading both \nspatially and temporally \u2013 from defined and prioritised spaces and times to casual use \nthroughout the home and throughout the day (Flichy, 2002; Livingstone, 2002). \nRatings show that television as a shared experience is in steady decline, for children and adults, \nwith the increasing diversity of channels resulting in greater fragmentation of the audience and \never-less adherence to a scheduled timetable of viewing. Today, few programmes attain mass \naudiences on the scale of, say, UK soaps twenty years ago (with 15-20 million viewers in a \nnation of some 60 million). Even mass audiences may not share their experiences: in the late \n80s, I observed a family of six, all fans of the Australian soap opera, Neighbours, who watched \non different sets or at different times \u2013 a dispersed mass audience, eschewing co-location in the \n\u2018family room\u2019 (Livingstone, 1992).8 \nIn 1955, watching alone was relatively rare: 24% of 10-11 year olds watched children\u2019s \nprogrammes alone, as did 23% of 13-14 year olds; for evening programmes, the proportions \nwere 11% (10-11 yrs) and 9% (13-14 yrs). Viewing with parents, on the other hand, was very \ncommon, particularly for evening programmes: 81% (10-11 yrs) and 88% (13-14 yrs), though \neven at that time, children\u2019s programmes were more often shared with siblings than parents \n(Himmelweit et al, 1958). Four decades later, watching alone had not risen among 10-11 year \nolds, but for 13-14 year olds, viewing alone rose sharply to 32%. Meanwhile, viewing with \n                                                 \n8 This is not to say that television is no longer important in the family, but rather to reveal the diverse and \nsometimes counter-normative ways in which it is embedded in the dispersed family, providing a common or \nprivate leisure activity, symbolic resources for family conversation and negotiation, and an occasion for the \nsocialisation of children regarding the wider world (Goodman, 1983). For many families, \u2018family time\u2019 is also \nmedia time, especially television time, and television may be positioned as scapegoat, boundary marker, \nescape, time manager, stress reducer, bartering agent, babysitter, companion, and more. \n 6 \nparents fell, both for the 10-11 year olds and, more strikingly, for the 13-14 year olds (33% with \nfather, 40% with mother) (Livingstone, Bovill, & Gaskell, 1999).9 A longitudinal study conducted \nIceland found that the percentage of 10-15 year olds who usually watched television alone rose \nfrom 2% in 1968 to 40% in 2003, while the proportion who watched with their parents fell \ncommensurately (Broddason, 2006). \nThere has been, in short, a discernable shift away from shared towards privatised viewing over \nthe past four decades and, arguably because adolescents only became \u2018teenagers\u2019 from the \n1950s onwards, this shift is more evident for 13-14 year olds than for 10-11 year olds.10 Though \nmultiple sets and competing programme preferences facilitate this trend (having television in \none\u2019s bedroom adds half an hour to daily UK viewing time, and one and a half hours in the US; \nLivingstone, 2002; Roberts et al, 2005), the primary driver is children themselves - the \u2018Young \nPeople, New Media\u2019 project found children wish to watch alone even more they actually do.11 \n \nLooking ahead: The changing public agenda \nI had first thought to argue that, for its first twenty years or so, television brought the family \ntogether but then, from the 1970s onwards, it began to pull them apart again. But, a better \naccount is one that recognises the signs of individualisation from the very early years of \ntelevision (and before) \u2013 in strategies of audience segmentation, a history of multiplication and \npersonalisation of domestic media, in youthful desires to escape the parental gaze, and so on. \nBefore these signs gathered strength, which took some decades, being dependent on longer \nterm trends regarding adolescence, the family and consumer society, there was time for the \n1950s family experiment to spawn the 1960s and 1970s family television experiment. This \nmoment in time, it seems, shaped normative expectations \u2013 academic, policy and popular - \nregarding television audiences for years to come. But at the turn of the twenty-first century, we \nmust recognise that it was the underlying long-term trend of individualisation, and its associated \ntrends of consumerism, globalisation and the democratisation of the family, that more strongly \nshaped and, was itself facilitated, by television. Two consequences of individualisation are worth \nsignalling by way of conclusion. These concern parental mediation and media literacy, concepts \nthat are central to today\u2019s research and policy agendas, yet they barely figured fifty years ago. \nParental mediation, I suggest, gains a new importance in what Giddens (1993: 184-5) calls \u2018the \ndemocratisation of the private sphere\u2019, while media literacy arises in the context of the \nindividualisation of risk (Beck, 1986\/2005), in this case, risk of media harm. \nThe social trends of the twentieth century combined to transform the \u2018Victorian\u2019 family, a model of \ndomestic life that prioritised a culture of stability, hard work, security, duty and respect into the \n\u2018democratic family\u2019 that prizes role flexibility, gender and generational equality, and a culture of \nself-fulfilment and individual rights. As Giddens (1991: 7) put it, in the democratised private \nsphere, children have gained the right to 'determine and regulate the conditions of their \nassociation' within the family, while parents have gained the duty to protect them from coercion, \nensure their involvement in key decisions, be accountable to them and others, and to respect \nand expect respect. For young people, this resulted in part from the economic and legal hiatus \nthat opened up in the past fifty years between dependent child and independent adult, resulting \nin tensions between the discourse of needs and that of individual rights. The new child-centred \nmodel of the family offers some resolution insofar as it advocates that parents should provide for \ntheir children economically for an extended period of time while simultaneously recognising their \nindependence in terms of sociality and culture, for now \u2018the goal of individual self-realisation \n                                                 \n9 Himmelweit et al asked in 1955, \u2018with whom do you most often view?\u2019 The \u2018Young People, New Media\u2019 \nproject asked almost the same question in the UK in 1997(\u2018with whom do you watch television for more than \nhalf the time?\u2019), though not distinguishing children\u2019s from evening programmes. \n10 Note that today, research extends the age range of \u2018children and young people\u2019 up to 18, while \nHimmelweit et al only researched those from 10 to 14 years old \u2013 after all, in mid-50s Britain, pupils left \nschool at 14 or 15 and entered the adult world, as apprentices if not as fully independent. \n11 This is not to call young people loners or social isolates, for one should note above discussion of the \nchanging nature of childhood. Nor should we overstate the case: most 6-17 year olds, including older teens, \nsaid they eat a main meal (75%) and watch television (68%) with their parents on most days of the week, \nand most talk to them about something that matters at least once or twice a week (70%). For parents, \ntelevision viewing remains the activity they most commonly share their children (Livingstone, 2002). \n 7 \novershadows community solidarity and stability\u2019 (Gadlin, 1978: 236). However, this creates new \ndifficulties in balancing the requirements of parents and children, difficulties to be resolved \nthrough negotiation rather than, as before, \u2018laying down the law\u2019, and which are often expressed \nthrough conflicts over space (the front door, the bedroom door), time (what to do, and watch, \nwhen) and media (personal vs. shared media, content preferences, etc; Andreasen, 1994; \nLivingstone, 2002).12 \nGiven this context, it is intriguing to note that Himmelweit et al asked few questions about \nparental mediation or regulation of television, observing simply that one in five do control (ban, \nrestrict, encourage) their child\u2019s viewing, and concluding that \u2018control, then, is rare, and where it \nexists, it is aimed at preventing the child from watching horror or frightening programmes\u2019 (p. \n378-9). Possibly, Himmelweit et al said little about parental mediation in the 1950s because its \nimportance was obvious, rather than because its role was then unanticipated. In early American \nresearch, the important of parental mediation received a little more consideration, especially as a \nproblem among supposedly \u2018negligent\u2019 working class families, who tended to treat television as \nthe electronic babysitter, permitting their children access to content appropriate only for adults \n(Butsch, 2000; Klapper, 1960). \nToday, parental mediation is conceptualised as combining three distinct strategies of restriction \n(on time, length or content of viewing), evaluation (guiding children on quality, interpretation, \ncriticism), and co-use (discussion while viewing, sharing the viewing experience). But in the work \nof Himmelweit, Klapper, Schramm et al, parenting was understood in terms of the Victorian \nmodel, with only restrictive mediation being considered. For example, Schramm et al. (p.148) \ndiscuss parental authority by noting that \u2018late bedtimes tend to occur in homes where parental \ncontrol is lax\u2019, and they stress the parental duty \u2018to shield a child from undue fright resulting from \ntelevision\u2019. But they say nothing that conceives of parents as equals who may share (or conflict \nover) the entertainment of viewing or as supporters who help their children \u2018get ahead\u2019 or \u2018keep \nup\u2019 in education or consumption. By contrast, in today\u2019s democratic family model, it is instead the \nlatter strategies that are emphasised (Valkenburg, Krcmar, Peeters, & Marseille, 1999) \u2013 \nNathanson (2004) asks parents to discuss screen violence with their children, for example, rather \nthan banning their viewing. It is curiously, then, that states seek to roll back national regimes of \nbroadcasting regulation, public policy is again determined that parents should bear the primary \nresponsibility for managing and controlling their children\u2019s media exposure, even though this \ndemands a restrictive approach that problematically casts parents back into precisely the \ngatekeeper and rule-enforcer role they have escaped from, albeit ambivalently, in recent \ndecades (Livingstone & Bober, 2006).13 \nNotwithstanding these shifts, children\u2019s escape from the authoritarian parent has been \ncurtailed, especially by comparison with the comparative freedoms of fifty years ago, though \nfor different reasons. Childhood and youth have, over the period we are concerned with here, \nbecome key sites for the anxieties of the risk society - a term by which Beck (1986\/2005), \npoints to the reflexive recognition of post war recent society that it faces vast yet uncertain \nand unmanageable risks of its own making.14 Not only are parents responsible for protecting \n                                                 \n12 Much of this privatised use of media is focussed on the bedroom, once a rather chilly and uncomfortable, \nsometimes forbidden, place in which to escape the demands of family life, but now positively valued \nopportunities for socialising and identity work, saturated with media images, sounds, technological artefacts \nand other media products. \n13 It is noteworthy that Himmelweit et al, writing in the then-dominant public service context of the UK \n(Oswell, 2002), direct most of their recommendations to broadcasters (the new intermediaries \u2013 \u2018in loco \nparentis\u2019 in the process of socialization since, as (Katz, 2003), argues, television disintermediated parents), \nwhile Schramm et al, writing in the commercial context of American (and, now, international) broadcasting, \ndivide theirs more evenly, as today, among broadcasters, parents, schools and government. \n14 Part of this story is that, as \u2018outside\u2019 spaces are construed as increasingly risky for children, \u2018home\u2019 took \nover as the locus of safety, identity and leisure. So, supporting Raymond Williams\u2019 (1974) identification of \nthe privatisation of leisure, historian Hugh Cunningham (1995: 179) concludes that for children, the postwar \nperiod saw a \u2018shift from a life focused on the street to one focused on the home... [and] this was \naccompanied by a change in the social organisation of the home. Parents, and in particular fathers, became \nless remote and authoritarian, less the centre of attention when they were present\u2019. One stark illustration: \nHillman et al (1990) found that while in 1971, 80% of UK seven and eight year-old children walked to school \non their own, by 1990 this figure had dropped to 9%. Within the home, especially for children, the bedroom \nhas become a central locus of media-rich leisure and, hence of the mediation of everyday life (refs). Thus, \n 8 \ntheir children from such risks, including the risk of media-related harms (Millwood Hargrave & \nLivingstone, 2006), but children too, in a context of the individualisation of risk, are \nresponsible. In the media and communication landscape, these risks are signalled by digital \nconvergence. As the EC\u2019s Information Society and Media Commissioner, Viviane Reding, \nsaid in December 2007: \n\u2018In a digital era, media literacy is crucial for achieving full and active citizenship\u2026The \nability to read and write \u2013 or traditional literacy \u2013 is no longer sufficient in this day and \nage... Everyone (old and young) needs to get to grips with the new digital world in \nwhich we live. For this, continuous information and education is more important than \nregulation.\u2019 (Europa, 2007) \nMedia literacy was not, it seems, a term in Himmelweit\u2019s vocabulary, though she was very \ninterested in differential levels of intelligence as a mediator of television\u2019s influence. As Luke \n(1990: 282) observes, the prevailing Behaviourist tradition meant that \u2018the possibility that viewers \nbring anything other than demographic variables to the screen was conceptually excluded\u2019. But \nfollowing the cognitive reframing not only of psychology but also, therefore, of the psychology of \nthe viewer, media literacy, we saw both a new focus on critical literacy as empowerment \n(Pecora, 2007) but also, more critically, that \u2018the discourse cleared a space for institutionalized \npractices of intervention\u2019\u2013 notably, media education, parental mediation and devolved content \nregulation (Luke, 1990: 282). Today, media literacy continues to grow in importance on both \nacademic and policy agendas, given current efforts to devolve media risks to an \u2018empowered\u2019 \nand media-savvy public (Livingstone, 2008).  The family\u2019s role in mediating the television (and \nalso an array of other media, including the internet) is, therefore, increasingly an educational \none, an informal extension of the formal requirements for children\u2019s learning, protection and \nparticipation. But television\u2019s role in mediating the family means that the children are somewhere \nelse, evading parental guidance and, precisely, \u2018doing their own thing\u2019 even when at home. \n \nBibliography \nAbrams, M.
