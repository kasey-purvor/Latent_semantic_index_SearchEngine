Based on this \nancient knowledge, the diagnosis of infectious diseases on the basis of an altered profile of \nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a new area of clinical biochemistry and can therefore be \nused for the early detection of infectious diseases in both, veterinary and human medicine \nanalysing readily collectable samples (i.e. blood, urine, exhaled breath, swabs). \nIn human medicine, \u2018artificial\u2019 or \u2018electronic\u2019 nose (e-nose) technology has been employed in \nseveral areas of medical diagnosis, including rapid detection of tuberculosis [1],  Helicobacter \npylori [2], bacterial sinusitis [3] and urinary tract infections [4, 5]. In veterinary medicine, the \nusefulness of e-nose technology was principally demonstrated for the first time in 2005 by \ndiscriminating serum samples obtained from badgers and cattle infected with Mycobacterium \nbovis from those obtained in non-infected controls [6]. The e-nose technology itself consists of \nan array of non-specific gas sensors. It functions in a manner similar to the olfactory system by \n\u2018smelling\u2019 various classes of volatile compound. To distinguish VOC mixtures, complex data \nanalysis is then used in order to classify a sample by pattern recognition. Despite these \nencouraging results, there is still a lack of knowledge about the source of VOCs detected. In the \nmammalian body, the composition of volatile gases may change significantly because of (i) the \nvarious speeds at which different metabolic products are removed from the blood, or (ii) the \nproduction of metabolic products arising from certain diseases or infection, either from the host \nresponse or the metabolising infective organism.  \nThe determination of acute phase proteins (APPs) is another diagnostic option that has \nbeen widely used in the last decades. The term \u2018acute phase proteins\u2019 describes a group of plasma \nproteins that are mainly synthesised in the liver and change in their concentrations substantially \nduring the so called \u2018acute phase reaction\u2019, i.e. an early reaction of the host in response to many \nPage 3 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 3 \ndifferent stimuli (such as infections, inflammation, tissue damage, immunological disorders or \nstress) [7]. The fact that circulating concentrations of APPs are measurable in the peripheral \nblood enables their use as quantifiable indicators of inflammation or infection. Over the last few \ndecades, APPs have become biomarkers of choice in human medicine for monitoring \ninflammation and infection. In veterinary medicine, APPs are accepted biomarkers for infection \nand inflammation in experimental studies to reflect the acute phase response as an integral part of \nthe innate immune system [8]. There is evidence that concentrations of serum APPs are related to \nthe severity of underlying disease and therefore may act as markers of both the presence and the \nextent of disease [9].  \nMannheimia haemolytica (formerly Pasteurella haemolytica) is one of the most important \ngram-negative bacteria isolated from the respiratory tract in cattle. Gaining access to the lungs \nwhen host defences are compromised by stress or other infections, it is known to become a \nsignificant component of enzootic broncho-pneumonia in calves [10]. Especially in fatal bovine \nrespiratory diseases of feedlot calves, M. haemolytica was the most common agent identified in \nperacute, acute, and subacute pathologic processes [11]. Experimental models of infection have \nbeen used for decades and for many reasons; for example to understand the pathogenesis of this \nparticular bacterium in the bovine respiratory system [12-16], to determine the effect of \ntreatments [17-19], or to develop different vaccination protocols [20-23]. In this experimental \nstudy, calves with Mannheimia haemolytica infection were used as a model to assess host \nresponse under the defined condition of a gram-negative bacterial infection in a natural host. \nBlood samples were collected before and after experimental challenge and were analysed for \nboth (i) the concentration of APPs and (ii) the response characteristics of e-nose sensors due to \nVOCs present in the headspace of blood. First, we hypothesised that an e-nose can discriminate \nblood samples of animals obtained after infection from those obtained before infections. \nSecondly, we tested whether the measurable e-nose response could be correlated with the acute \nphase reaction generated in the host, because nothing is currently known about the relationship \nPage 4 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 4 \nbetween the acute phase reaction of the host and the change in its metabolic profile of VOCs. To \nthe best of our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating that a changed VOC profile of \nserum headspace correlates with acute phase reaction in the host, following a pathogenic \ninfection.   \n \n2. Animals, material and methods \n2.1 Animals \nA cohort of 20 conventional cross-bred calves was used. Animals were introduced at the age of 3 \nto 15 days and were housed in 4 groups (each group consisted of 5 calves) under controlled \nconditions according to the guidelines for animal welfare in the European Union. The calves \nwere bedded on barley\/wheat straw and fed with commercially available milk substitutes and \ncoarse meal. Water and hay were supplied ad libitum. Daily clinical observations (including \nmonitoring of respiratory rate, nasal secretions, ocular secretions, rectal temperature, appetite, \nand body weight) were used to confirm the clinical status of calves before they were included in \nthe experiment. All phases of the study were performed at a specialised veterinary institute \n(Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Germany) under supervision of a veterinarian, and \nhad ethical approval from the Commission for the Protection of Animals of the state of Thuringia \n(registration number: 23-51\/99). \n \n2.2 Experimental challenge and study design \nAged 52  5  days (body weight: 64  6 kg, mean  SD), all calves were inoculated with \nMannheimia haemolytica biotype A serotype 1 (M. haem. A1). As described by Schimmel in \n1987 [24], an 18-hour broth culture of M. haem. A1, strain 2353 (P588) was used for the \nexperimental challenge resulting in an acute respiratory infection. Ten ml of the culture \ncontaining 1.5 - 2.0 x 10\n9\n cfu per ml were administered intratracheally per calf and on two \nPage 5 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 5 \nconsecutive days (the interval between the two inoculations was 30 hours). Surviving calves \nwere euthanized for necropsy 5 days after the first inoculation of M. haem. A1.  \nThis study was designed as an intra-individually controlled study in order to decrease the \nnumber of animals used for experimental purposes for ethical reasons. Accordingly, the animals \nwere their own controls considering the pre-infection data as a baseline. Thus, each animal was \ncarefully and consecutively characterised before challenge (non-infected status or baseline data) \nas well as after challenge (infected status) by identical examinations and techniques. Daily \nclinical examinations were performed on each animal throughout the full study as explained \nabove.  \n \n2.3 Collection of blood and serum preparation \nTwo blood samples were collected from each animal 7 days and one hour before experimental \nchallenge. Eight blood samples were obtained post-inoculation (p.i): 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, \n3 d, 4 d, and 5 d after the first bacterial exposure. Jugular venous blood was collected using \nplastic syringes for serum production (S-Monovette\u00ae-Serum, Sarstedt AG & Co, Nuembrecht, \nGermany). Serum was harvested by centrifugation (20 minutes at 1500 g) and stored at -20\u00b0C until \nanalysed.  \n \nPage 6 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 6 \n2.4 E-nose headspace analyses \nIn this study, a conducting polymer-based electronic nose containing an array of 13 sensors was \nused (e-nose, ST214, Scensive Tech. Ltd., Leeds, UK). Serum headspace was sampled using the \nstatic sampling method described previously [25]. Briefly, serum was defrosted and pipetted into \nNalophan bags. Polypropylene tubes were inserted into the bags which were sealed at both ends. \nThe bag volume was 0.75 litre and the sample volume was 900 \u00b5l. All bags were then filled with \nzero grade air and incubated for 15 minutes at 25\u00b0C. Time for adsorption and desorption during \nanalyses was 20 seconds. The total time per replicate was 55 seconds. Seven replicates per \nsample were taken, and divergence (i.e. maximum amplitude of sensor signal in sample analysis) \nof replicates 3 to 5 were used for further analysis since they proved to be stable in flow [25]. All \nsamples were blinded and analysed randomly. Ambient air temperature was kept constant at \n25\u00b0C. Three replicates were used for analysis.  \n \n2.5. Analyses of acute phase proteins (APP) \nLipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)  Concentrations of LBP in sera were measured \nusing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) described elsewhere [26]. Intra- and \ninter-assay coefficients of variance were below 10%. The detection limit of the LBP assay was \n0.45 ng\/mL.  \nHaptoglobin (Hp)  Con entrations of Hp in sera were measured by means of an ELISA as \ndescribed previously [26, 27]. The coating antibody was IgG (rabbit) anti-human haptoglobin \n(DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). The same antibody, but conjugated with horseradish peroxidise, \nwas used as the detection reagent. Hp-standard was a calibrated bovine blood plasma. Calibration \nwas done with a colorimetric assay (Tridelta Development Ltds., Greystones, Co., Wicklow, \nIrland) and also against purified bovine Hp isolated by affinity chromatography. The detection \nlimit of the bovine haptoglobin ELISA was 0.8 \u00b5g\/ml and the intra- and interassay coefficients of \nvariance were less than 11%.  \nPage 7 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 7 \n \n2.6 Statistical analyses \nBefore applying any statistical test, all data were checked for normal distribution. Normally \ndistributed data are expressed as mean  standard deviation (SD) while data without normal \ndistribution are given as median and range (difference between minimum and maximum). \nBiological variation such as the individual calf, the infectious status (non-infected versus \ninfected), and the time point of blood collection within the study, was also assessed for e-nose \nresponses and APPs using mANOVA. Significant differences between datasets were identified \nusing the multiple range test. Analysis of linear regression (Pearson) was used to identify linear \ncorrelations between two variables. Spearman rank correlation was applied when dealing with \nnon-normally distributed data. The level of significance for all statistical methods applied was \nP \u2264 0.05. Results were displayed as \u2018Box and Whisker\u2019 plots. Outlier values are 1.5 to 3 times of \nthe length of a box away from the median and extreme values are further away than 3 times of \nthe length of the box. In addition, principle component analysis (PCA) was performed based on \ndata averaged over all individuals in order to eliminate biological variability (Matlab 2006b \nincluding the PLS toolbox version 3.5, Eigenvector Inc.)). Consequently, three data points were \navailable per time point of the experiment. One data point represented one replicate averaged \nover all subjects. Raw e-nose divergences and auto-scaled data were analysed using PCA. Auto-\nscaling is a normalisation technique which scales all values of a column (e.g. for each sensor) by \nthe standard deviation of each column of the matrix in order to eliminate different ranges in \nmagnitudes between the columns.  \n \nPage 8 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 8 \n3. Results  \n3.1 Clinical course of the study \nAfter experimental inoculation, 6 of 20 calves (30%) died spontaneously before the end of the \nstudy. Four calves died between 24-48 hours, and two died between 48-72 hours after the first \nchallenge with M. haem. A1.  \nIn surviving calves, the following clinical signs were dominant: within the first 6 hours \nafter challenge the appetite dropped markedly and the majority of animals became quiet, dull or \ndepressed; significant increases in respiratory rates were already observed within the first 3 hours \nand in rectal temperature within the first 6 hours after challenge. The maximum temperature was \nmeasured 2 days after challenge (Figure 1). Both rectal temperature and breathing frequency \n(data not shown) remained significantly increased in the group until the end of the study. \nSurviving calves (n = 14) were euthanized for necropsy at 5 d p.i. \n \n[INSERT figure 1 about HERE] \n \n3.2 Acute phase proteins (APP) \nAnalysis of serum samples before infection (n = 40) showed concentrations of LBP of \n2.4 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b5g\/ml (mean \u00b1 SD) and 0.02 \u00b1 0.04 mg\/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) of Hp. After challenge with \nM. haem. A1, APPs increased significantly with the following time kinetics (Figure 2): for both \nLBP and Hp, the first significant increase was observed 12 hours p.i. Maximal concentrations \nwere seen 24 and 48 hours p.i.. for LBP (about 600% of baseline data) and 48 hours p.i. for Hp. \nSignificantly elevated concentrations of both APPs were measurable until the end of the \nobservation period (5 d p.i.). A significant relationship was found between LBP and Hp as \nexpressed by the coefficient of Spearman\u2019s rank correlation of rsp = 0.73 (P < 0.0001, n = 178). \nPage 9 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 9 \nRank correlations between rectal temperature and APPs were rsp = 0.51 (P < 0.0001, \nn = 178) for LBP, and rsp = 0.49 (P < 0.0001, n = 178) for Hp, both indicating significant \nrelationships between the rise in body temperature and increased concentrations of APPs in the \nblood. \n \n[INSERT figure 2 about HERE]  \n \n3.3 Response of e-nose sensors \nE-nose sensor responses of the complete array were analysed both in terms of changes due to the \ninfection status (i.e. responses before and after experimental challenge) and over the time course \nof the study. Regarding the infection status, responses of sensors 3, 6 and 7 showed differences \nbetween all pre- and all post- inoculation samples (mANOVA, P < 0.05). Divergences of \nsensitive sensors became more negative after challenge.  \nIn terms of the time course, responses of sensors 2 to 8, 10 and 11 showed kinetic profiles as \nillustrated in Figure 3 as a typical example. In general, divergences of sensitive e-nose sensors \nwere approximately the same before and shortly after challenge, then declined and reached a \nminimum at days 2 and 3 p.i., and increased again until the end of the study. However, responses \nof sensors 10 and 11 continued to decrease. This implies that there were a number of volatiles \nchanging their concentrations in headspace in different ways during the course of infection, \ndetected by the e-nose. \n \n[INSERT figure 3 about HERE] \n \nPerforming PCA, no discrimination between time points were found due to the different ranges \nin magnitude of the sensors. After auto-scaling, a clear discrimination of time points 2 and 3 days \nafter infection and the remaining data points were found. Principle component 1 and 2 covered in \nPage 10 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 10 \ntotal 92.62% of all variance. This discrimination was found on a group level when averaging \nover subjects and confirmed significant differences found using mANOVA and multiple range \ntest for individual sensors without averaging.  \n \n[INSERT figure 4 about HERE] \n \n3.4 Correlations between e-nose results, rectal temperature and acute phase proteins  \nAs shown in Table 1, significant correlations were found between responses of e-nose sensors \nand the severity of the infection expressed by either APP concentrations in the blood or rectal \ntemperature. Strongest correlations were found between e-nose responses and the concentration \nof both APPs. With increasing concentrations of LBP, sensors 2-4 and 6-8 became more negative \nand sensors 10 and 11 became more positive. As the concentration of haptoglobin increased, \nresponses of sensors 2-8 and sensor 13 became more negative. According to most of the sensor \nresponses, the general temporal profile after infection was inversely proportional to increasing \nconcentrations of APPs.  \nThe most negative responses of e-nose sensors were found 48 hours after challenge which \ncorresponded to the highest peaks of Hp concentrations. In contrast, peaks in LBP concentrations \nwere observed earlier, i.e. 24 hours after infection (see 3.2.). Therefore, coefficients of \ncorrelation between e-nose sensors and LBP were lower compared to those between e-nose \nsensors and haptoglobin.  \nWith respect to body temperature, only the responses of sensors 8 and 9 were \nsignificantly linked to fever; showing an increase in divergence with increasing rectal \ntemperature. Coefficients of correlation were very low; ranging between 0.09 and 0.14. \n \n[INSERT table 1 about HERE] \n \nPage 11 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 11 \n4. Discussion \nThe purpose of this study was (i) to assess the potential of electronic nose (e-nose) technology to \ndetect differences in the patterns of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from the \nperipheral blood in an acute respiratory infection of calves, and (ii) to evaluate e-nose signals in \ncomparison with the acute host response and rectal temperature; both known non-specific \nbiomarkers of infectious or inflammatory diseases.  \nThe experimentally induced M. haemolytica challenge used in this study represents a \nbovine model of a severe bacterial infection with acute clinical illness and spontaneous deaths. \nOriginally the study was performed to study the course of the disease and to develop potential \nmedication but could also be used for assessing clinical symptoms and changes in headspace \ncomposition. There is evidence that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was most likely heavily \ninvolved in the pathogenesis of acute host response because Mannheimia species belong to the \ngroup of gram-negative bacteria producing LPS, and because LPS binding protein (i.e. LBP) \nincreased significantly after challenge (Fig. 2A). The fact that one third of the calves died within \n3 days after exposure reveals the well known phenomenon of limited ability of calves to tolerate \nLPS or even a hyperresponsiveness to endotoxin that has been described by others [28]. \nThe systemic host response to infection includes the acute-phase response (APR) which is \na highly conserved, complex, and non-specific series of immunological reactions that is mediated \nby pro-inflammatory cytokines and results in an entire array of metabolic and physiologic \nchanges. One characteristic feature of APR after bacterial infection is a remarkable change in \nconcentration of APPs [29]. Many of these APPs originate from the liver and represent \nalterations in the intermediary metabolism during the host defence to inflammation, injury and \ninfection [7]. Being called \u2018chemicals thermometers\u2019, APPs respond in a close relationship to \ndisease progression or recovery [8]. In this study, LBP and Hp, both accepted as major APPs in \nbovines [7, 26, 30], were used in addition to clinical symptoms (i.e. rectal temperature) in \nassessing the severity of the disease. While LBP has been assessed in the acute phase of \nPage 12 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 12 \nexperimental infection models in bovine and porcine species so far [7, 31], Hp has also been \nidentified as an useful diagnostic tool for detecting infectious respiratory diseases in calves even \nunder field conditions [32]. \n \nDiscrimination ability of the e-nose \nWith the e-nose used in this experiment, clinically healthy cattle could be discriminated from \nchallenged individuals with severe clinical symptoms. Significant differences in divergences in \ne-nose sensor array responses were found at the group level considering the median of groups per \nday. These differences obtained with sensors 3, 6 and 7 allowed discrimination between infected \nand non-infected individuals. Discrimination based on individual samples was not possible \nbecause of large variation across all sensors due to methodological factors and inconsistencies of \nthe sensor surface associated with them [25]. Discrimination was also made difficult by the \ntemporal changes in divergences over the course of the infection. Many sensors (e.g. 2 to 8, 10 \nand 11) showed a significant decline at days 2 and 3 after challenge while responses obtained \nfrom other time points after infection were similar to pre-infection divergences. This minimised \nthe total differences between all pre- and post challenge samples but on the other hand, this \ntemporal profile reflected the progression of the infection.  \n The fact that e-nose sensor signals were reduced (i.e. decreasing reactions in e-nose \nresponse) after challenge is in good agreement with data reported from human medicine showing \nthe ability of an electronic nose to detect changes in the human body odour as a result of renal \ndysfunction by reducing multivariate sensor signals [5, 33]. However, the biochemical \nbackground for both (i) the discrimination between infection and non-infection and (ii) the \ntemporal profile after infection still remains unclear since it could not be elucidated in this study \nwhich molecules were responsible for the changes. To clarify this point, further analytical \noptions and techniques are required (e.g. GC-MS). \n \nPage 13 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 13 \nComparison between e-nose responses and the severity of the disease  \nIn this study, the severity of the experimentally induced bacterial infection was confirmed and \ncharacterised by clinical illness and spontaneous deaths. Body temperature and concentrations of \nAPPs measurable in the peripheral blood provided additional quantitative assessment of the host \nresponse. Different APPs may show either an increase or a decrease in concentration following \ninfection [7]. The two APPs included in this study, LBP and Hp, increased significantly after \nexposure to M. haem. A1. These findings confirm results from previous studies reporting an \nincreased concentration of many APPs, including Hp and LBP, following an infection of the \nrespiratory tract of calves with gram-negative bacteria (Pasteurella multocida or Mannheimia \nhaemolytica) [34, 35]. \n LBP and Hp were positively correlated with one another in this study and expressed \nsimilar temporal profiles over the experimental period. Interestingly, the correlation between \nLBP and Hp was stronger (rSP > 0.7) compared to the correlations between body temperature and \neach of the APPs (rSP  0.5). Nevertheless all three parameters reflected the APR in calves after \nbacterial infection with M. haem. A1, thus providing a good basis for the evaluation of responses of \ne-nose sensors.  \n The divergence of multiple sensors as a part of the e-nose array changed significantly \nover time comparing pre- and post challenge samples. Comparing the temporal profile of the \ne-nose responses with rectal temperature and APP concentrations revealed general correlations of \nseveral sensors and the surrogate markers for infection. Correlations between e-nose responses \nand LBP or Hp were more prominent compared to correlations between e-nose sensors and rectal \ntemperature. However, correlation coefficients were low (rSP \u2264 0.20). This might be due to the fact \nthat the temporal profile observed for each of e-nose signals, rectal temperature and APP \nconcentrations were sometimes out of phase with one another, even though they were comparable \nin shape. Nevertheless, the correlation between the concentration of APPs as surrogate markers of \nPage 14 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 14 \ninfection and e-nose sensor responses demonstrate the potential for VOC analysis by e-nose or \nother methods for monitoring and diagnosing infection and\/or host response.  \n \nConclusions  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating e-nose technology by comparing \nresponses with APPs in the peripheral blood.  \n E-nose analysis of the headspace of blood samples was shown to have potential for \ndetecting animal infection. E-nose sensors allowed discrimination at the group level between \npre-inoculation and post-inoculation samples in an animal model exposed to the gram-negative \nbacteria M. haem. A1. These findings warrant validation of e-noses in diagnosing different \ninfections caused by different micro-organisms.  \n There are significant correlations between divergences of e-nose sensors and acute \nphase markers present in the blood of the infected host. The results are encouraging and provide \nthe basis for the non-invasive detection of host responses based on the detection of VOCs. \nFurther studies are required to identify VOCs that could be used as specific biomarkers for certain \ninfections or diseases.  \nPage 15 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 15 \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are very grateful to DVM Joern Seifert Annelie Langenberg, Gerhard Foedisch and \nall colleagues of the technical staff of the animal house (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Jena) for \nskilful assistance during the study.
