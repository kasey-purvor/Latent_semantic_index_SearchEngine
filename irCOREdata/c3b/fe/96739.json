VC 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\nINTRODUCTION TO\nPATTERN FORMATION\nWhat is a pattern? Patterning can\nbe considered as the loss of homo-\ngeneity, when small, random per-\nturbations to a system are amplified\nthrough a number of local processes\nand iterations to form recognizable\nstructure or order (Meinhardt, 1982;\nErmentrout and Edelstein-Keshet,\n1993; Murray, 2003; Chuong et al.,\n2006a). For example, one of the sim-\nplest forms of patterning is the\nasymmetric conversion of part of a\nhomogenous field (Fig. 1A; gray) to\na different state (Fig. 1B; black). The\nnew pattern can be generated as\ndots, stripes, patches, segments,\nbranches, etc. (Fig. 1C\u2013E), and can be\narranged randomly or periodically.\nWhat are the mechanisms of bio-\nlogical pattern formation? In some\ncases, they may be based on the\ndistribution of cell lineage so that\ncells strictly follow their fates genet-\nically (Fig. 1F). In other cases, it\nmay be based on combinatorial mo-\nlecular coding which can be inter-\npreted at the enhancer\/transcrip-\ntion factor level (Small and Levine,\n1991) or at the cell adhesion level\n(Steinberg, 1996) (Fig. 1G and H).\nThese molecular changes usually\nappear before the real morphologi-\ncal changes and are referred to as\nprepatterns (Nagorcka and Mooney,\n1992; Forgacs and Newman, 2005).\nThey can explain many downstream\nphenomena that follow the gener-\nated prepattern, but do not explain\nthe upstream issue\u2014we do not\nknow how these molecular codes\nare set up. For example, morphoge-\nnetic gradient models have been\nproposed in which cells can interpret\ntheir position within a morphogen\ngradient, as Wolpert (1969) has\nproposed in the French flag model\n(Fig. 1C). Cells can enter a new\nstate in a concentration dependent\nmanner (Fig. 1I and J) (Ashe and\nBriscoe, 2006). This can explain\nmany examples of how molecular\ncodes are set, but still does not\nresolve the issue as to the origin of\nthe pattern\u2014we still do not know\nwhat sets up the molecular gradi-\nent, for example, how the exact\nmorphogen and its point of secre-\ntion are determined. This is where\nself-organization comes into play:\nstochastic events combinedwith physi-\nR\nE\nV\nIE\nW\nVC 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\nBirth Defects Research (Part C) 78:280\u2013291 (2006)\nRandall B.

See text for further explanation.\ncochemical principles can increase\nthe order and\/or structure of a sys-\ntem, perhaps resulting in emergent\nevents, without being guided by an\nexternal source (Newman and Com-\nper, 1990; Camazine et al., 2003;\nNewman et al., 2006). In other\nwords, patterns at the global level\nmay solely arise as a result of inter-\nactions between lower level compo-\nnents.\nReaction diffusion models follow-\ning the method first outlined by\nTuring (1952) have been applied to\nexplain many biological periodic\npatterning processes (Fig. 1K and\nL) (Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972). In\nthis model, the morphogenetic field\nstarts with a homogenous distribu-\ntion of cells, activators, and inhibi-\ntors, and random fluctuations initi-\nate the periodic patterning process.\nThe activators and inhibitors un-\ndergo a series of interactions, which\ncan include self- and cross-activa-\ntion and inhibition; both can diffuse,\nwith the inhibitor diffusing further\nthan the activator. With time, pat-\nterns in the form of dots or stripes in\nactivator and inhibitor concentration\ngradually emerge, with the pattern\ndepending on the ratio of activators\nto inhibitors and the size and shape\nof the pattern field. This mechanism\nhas been proposed to explain the\nformation of hair follicles (Nagorcka\nand Mooney, 1992) and feather pat-\nterning (Jung et al., 1998).\nCellular automata models have\nalso been proposed to explain many\nbiological phenomena (Fig. 1M)\n(Wolfram, 1992; Deutsch et al.,\n2004). In a general cellular autom-\nata model, the field is divided into a\nnumber of discrete \u2018\u2018cells,\u2019\u2019 which\nevolve through a number of time\nsteps, according to a set of rules\nbased on the states of neighboring\n\u2018\u2018cells.\u2019\u2019 Each \u2018\u2018cell\u2019\u2019 of the model cor-\nresponds to an area of the pattern\nfield and information on this area is\nstored as the \u2018\u2018state\u2019\u2019 of the cell.\nAlong this line, a digital hormone\nmodel has been developed to ex-\nplain the formation of dermal con-\ndensations by feather mesenchymal\ncells (Shen et al., 2004). The role\nthat stochastic interactions may\nplay in hair cycling have been\nexplored using a cellular automation\nmodel (Halloy et al., 2002).\nOscillation is another important\nproperty that may be used in pat-\nterning. The oscillation can occur at\nthe level of a single cell, or at the\nlevel of an organ (e.g., hair and\nfeather follicle) (Fig. 1P, S, and T). A\nclock and wavefront mechanism in-\nvolving cellular oscillation has been\nused to explain the formation of\nsomites (Fig. 1N\u2013P) (Pourquie\u00b4, 2003).\nOscillation of hair follicles in hair cy-\ncling becomes very visible in darkly\npigmented normal mice, such as\nC57BL6\/J (e.g. chnemus et al.,\n2005) and in mutant mice, such as\nnude mice and Msx2 null mice (Mil-\nitzer, 2001; Ma et al., 2003; Suzuki\net al., 2003; Mecklenburg et al.,\n2005). A model based on the Belou-\nsov-Zhabotinski reaction was\nrecently suggested to explain this\nphenomena of wave formation, al-\nthough no underlying molecular ba-\nsis was identified (Fig. 1R; Fig. 5)\n(Suzuki et al., 2003).\nOf course, the physicochemical\nevents are still genetically based\nsince the biological patterns are\nspecies-specific. A way to conceive\nthis is that DNA gives rise to RNA\nand proteins that build cells with\nunique physicochemical properties.\nAt this level, groups of cells interact\nwith outcomes based on these prop-\nerties and the surrounding en-\nvironment\u2014not just on the mole-\ncule itself. Therefore, the pattern\nformation process is best appreci-\nated as a combination of genetic\nand epigenetic events, and the re-\nsults are both deterministic and\nstochastic, as seen in the finger-\nprints of homozygotic twins: similar\nbut nonidentical (reviewed in Jiang\net al., 2004).\nOrgans can also grow and change\ntheir shape, size, and organization\nduring development (Fig. 1S and T).\nAnother level of variation is that the\nmorphogenetic field (in this case,\nthe surface of the animal body)\nchanges in size and shape during\ndevelopment (Fig. 1U\u2013X). The way\nin which these changes take place\ncan influence patterns which are at\na formative stage. For example, du-\nring the expansion of the skin, new\ndermal and\/or epidermal cells may\nbe added to specific regions such as\nthose receiving cells from the der-\nmatome or the advancing ventral\nbody folds. In other cases, new cells\nmay be inserted randomly all over\nthe developing skin (Fig. 1U\u2013X).\nThese growth modes can have dif-\nferent consequences for patterns\nforming on the skin. Similarly, the\nshape of the morphogenetic field\nmay change, even sometimes re-\nducing in size, and this also may\nlead to variation in patterning; for\nexample, the formation of stripes\nrather than spots (Fig. 1Y and Z)\n(Murray, 2003).\nOur aim is to try to analyze these\npattern formation processes and\nidentify the biological bases under-\nlying them, but much remains to be\nlearned. We have described above\nonly some examples, and they cer-\ntainly do not exhaust all models that\nhave been proposed for patterning.\nWe can also contemplate that com-\nplex pattern formation is generated\nthrough a combination of the above\nprocesses, which perhaps results in\npatterns that are more robust to\ngenetic and environmental pertur-\nbations. We will point out these pat-\nterns and the processes that may be\ninvolved in the following sections.\nDEVELOPMENT-BASED\nAND UNALTERABLE\nPATTERNS\nAlthough the appearance of integu-\nments of mammals, birds, and rep-\ntiles can be very different (Fig. 2A),\nthe development of their skin and\nskin appendages share similar hier-\narchical morphogenetic processes\n(Fig. 2B). In some cases, different\ntypes of skin appendages appear,\nwhile in others, the patterns of simi-\nlar types of appendages are ar-\nranged differently (Ball, 1999). We\nthink that this is controlled through\ngenetic and epigenetic controls that\noperate at different levels (Jiang\net al., 2004). Here we take a closer\nlook at these regulatory processes.\nRegional Specificity\nRegional specificity implies that dif-\nferent skin regions such as the scalp,\nbeard, eyebrows, face, lips, palms,\nnails, mammary glands, sweat glands,\netc., have different characteristics.\nEpidermal precursors (or stem cells)\n282 WIDELITZ ET AL.\nBirth Defects Research (Part C) 78:280\u2013291, (2006)\nare initially multipotent and compe-\ntent to form all these different struc-\ntures. During development, special\ndomains of the dermis begin sending\nspecific messages to the epidermis.\nThrough a series of epithelial\u2013mesen-\nchymal interactions, these different\nskin domains with special structures\nand functions gradually emerge. The\nintegument diversifies to endow dif-\nferent functions to different parts of\nthe human skin. An example of re-\ngional specificity can be seen by\ncomparing the different types of\nfeathers present on the breast,\nwing, tail, etc., of birds. This is most\nevident in pheasants, as shown in\nFig. 2A.\nHow dermal specificity and epider-\nmal competence are set up is mostly\nunknown. A model based on a skin\nHox code was proposed, suggesting\nthat different combinations of Hox\ngene expression may be the basis of\nskin regional specificity, setting up\nthe subsequent differences in diffus-\nible morphogens and adhesion mol-\necules (Chuong, 1993). Different\nHox expression patterns are shown\nin different regions of chicken skin\n(Kanzler et al., 1997; Duboule,\n1998; Reid and Gaunt, 2002). In-\ndeed there are spatiotemporally de-\nfined, specific HOX expression pat-\nterns in human skin (Stelnicki et al.,\n1998), and the Hox expression pat-\nterns of dermal cells derived from\ndifferent topological skin regions in\nhumans are different (Chang et al.,\n2002).\nMost interestingly, the characteris-\ntics of these different skin regions\ncan be trans-determined. For ex-\nample, the engrailed pathway was\nshown to be involved in defining\nthe mesenchymal characteristics of\nthe ventral versus the dorsal paw\n(Loomis et al., 1996). Tbx4 and Tbx5\nare shown to be involved in defining\nthe identity of the chicken leg versus\nwing, and hence scale or feather\nforming dermis (Rodriguez-Esteban\net al., 1999). Epidermal cells can\ntrans-differentiate and convert\nhairs into glands or scales into\nfeathers under the influence of ret-\ninoic acid, or by ectopic expression\nof specific molecules such as b-cat-\nenin (Dhouailly et al., 1980; Robin-\nson et al., 1990; Widelitz et al.,\n2000). A recently engineered K14-\nnoggin transgenic mouse shows\nthat sweat glands are transformed\nto hairs (Plikus et al., 2004), while\nnoggin overexpression under the\nneuron-specific enolase promoter\ncan convert outer root sheath ke-\nratinocytes into sebocytes (Guha\net al., 2004). An adult cornea can\nFigure 2.

These\nobservations imply that the specific\ncombinatorial molecular codes may\nspecify phenotypes of skin and skin\nappendages (Chuong, 1993; Fli-\nniaux et al., 2004; Prin and\nDhouailly, 2004). Altering these\ncodes may lead to a resetting of the\nphenotypes. The upstream question\nconcerning how the molecular codes\nare set remains unanswered.\nDevelopmental Wave\nDuring skin development, hair or\nfeather primordia are laid out in a\ntemporal order as they gradually\nacquire competence (reviewed in\nDhouailly et al., 2004). Their arrange-\nment and orientation are reflected\nas a propagating wave of skin ap-\npendage formation. This process is\nclearly shown in the chicken skin in\nFigure 3A. In the spinal tract of the\nchicken, the formation starts at the\nmidline and spreads bilaterally. At\nthe lateral edge, feather primordia\nare at the induction stage. Toward\nthe midline, they progress to form\nshort feather buds, long feather buds,\nand feather filaments with branching\nmorphogenesis, etc. A morphoge-\nnetic wave sweeping from themidline\nto the lateral has been inferred\n(Sengel, 1990). However, although\nthe lateral row appears after the\nmore medial row, the formation of\nthe lateral row does not really have to\ndepend on the medial row (Jiang\net al., 1999). While this sequential\nappearance may be perceived as a\n\u2018\u2018gradient,\u2019\u2019 it is actually a temporal\nwave since the lateral feather buds\nwill eventually also go through feather\nbud and filament stages. For a tract,\nthere has to be a primary row before\nthis sequential appearance takes\nplace. The gradual emergence of buds\nalong the primary row in the midline\ncan be readily visualized by in situ\nhybridization staining for b-catenin\n(Fig. 3B). Themolecular basis of these\nprocess remains unknown.\nIn humans, this is manifested as\nhair whorl patterns in the occipital\nregion (Fig. 1Q) (reviewed in Plikus\nand Chuong, 2004). In human\nfetuses, lanugo hairs form whorl\npatterns both on the scalp and trunk\nskin (Gworys and Domagala, 2003).\nOn the thoracic wall there are\nlanugo whorls that begin bilaterally\nover the nipples. The whorls col-\nlide and merge along the midlines\n(Domagala, personal communica-\ntion). In adults, whorl patterns are\ndistinct only on the parietal scalp. Is\nthe whorl pattern genetically con-\ntrolled? A pair of homozygotic twins\nFigure 3. Temporal wave. A: In situ hybridization of Shh in embryonic chicken skin. Midline is indicated by an arrow. Feather bud for-\nmation starts from the midline, and then lateral buds appear sequentially. From the lateral edge to the midline are regions of no feather\nprimordia, feather placodes, short buds, long buds, and feather filaments with branch formation. B: In situ hybridization of b-catenin.\nThe feather field first homogenously expresses b-catenin at a moderate level in the morphogenetic zone. Then the periodically\narranged buds emerge gradually expressing high levels of b-catenin, while the lateral inhibitory zone does not express beta catenin.\nFrom Widelitz et al. (2000).\n284 WIDELITZ ET AL.\nBirth Defects Research (Part C) 78:280\u2013291, (2006)\nwere shown to have one and two\nwhorls, respectively (Paine et al.,\n2004). Therefore, there must be an\nepigenetic component in hair whorl\ndetermination. While conserved mo-\nlecular pathways underlie all hair fol-\nlicle formation, local environmental\nand fortuitous factors can influence\nthe final hair pattern.\nIn the mouse, transgenic mice\nthat lose frizzled 6 show the forma-\ntion of multiple whorls (Guo et al.,\n2004), suggesting the involvement\nof the Wnt pathway in this process.\nInterestingly, some strains of guinea\npigs also show multiple whorls on\ntheir skin.\nThe formation of fingerprints is\nanother example, as discussed in\nthe next section.\nPeriodic Patterning\nThis mechanism is most obvious\nin the formation of skin append-\nages and pigment patterns. During\nthe formation of feather primordia,\nthe epithelium has to become com-\npetent to respond to induction sig-\nnals (forming a field). A reaction\ndiffusion mechanism, involving ac-\ntivators and inhibitors, is proposed\nto operate in the dermal mesen-\nchyme (Jung et al., 1998; Jiang\net al., 1999). Through this mecha-\nnism, cells are set to become the pri-\nmordia of skin appendages, stochas-\ntically. This then leads to the forma-\ntion of the feather or hair primordia,\nevenly spaced with interfollicular skin.\nSimilar processes were proposed\nfor hair\/wool formation (Nagorcka\nand Mooney, 1985; Moore et al.,\n1998; Meinhardt and Gierer, 2000).\nIt should be emphasized that the\nprocess of periodic patterning can\nbe uncoupled from the developmen-\ntal wave process discussed in the\nprevious paragraph.\nThe sequential appearance of\nfeather buds is so exquisite (Fig.\n3A) that it led scientists to propose\nmodels that are based on the use\nof previous buds as templates\n(Murray and Oster, 1984). The\nexperiments by Jiang et al. (1999)\nshowed that in a reconstitution sit-\nuation, in which mesenchymal cells\nare dissociated into single cells, the\nperiodic patterns will reform simul-\ntaneously. So the sequential appear-\nance results from a global compe-\ntence wave imposed on the local per-\niodic patterning process.\nAnother dramatic example often\nreferred to is the dissolution of pig-\nment cells that leads to the forma-\ntion of stripes on zebra fish or\nzebras and the formation of pig-\nment ducts on fish or leopards. This\nwas addressed earlier by Murray\n(1993). Recently, Prum and Wil-\nliamson (2002) also applied a reac-\ntion diffusion mechanism to make\na theoretical model of feather pig-\nment patterns. However, some pig-\nment patterns are controlled genet-\nically by enhancer regions, as\nshown by differences in the Droopy\nEar mouse mutant. Here, the nor-\nmal, sharp delineation between\ndorsal and ventral pigmentation\npatterns is disrupted. This is pro-\nduced by a loss of function muta-\ntion in TBox 15, which then allows\nagouti to be expressed further dor-\nsally (Candille et al., 2004).\nDo these patterns result from\ngenetic coding or stochastic events?\nIn fact, it is likely to be both. For ex-\nample, consider patterns such as\nfingerprints (Kucken and Newell,\n2005). They are used for individual\nidentification because the ridge\nwidth and possibility for branching\nnodal points provide ample possibil-\nity for endless variation. Finger-\nprints among monozygotic twins\nhave more similar attributes (similar\nwidth, organization plan) than with\nunrelated individuals, but they are\nnonidentical and are sufficiently dif-\nferent to be used as individual iden-\ntifiers (Jain et al., 2002). Thus there\nis a nongenetic component at this\nlevel of tissue morphogenesis, where\nmolecular codes become indirect\nand cells interact based on physical-\nchemical rules.\nMorphogenetic Gradient\nWe acknowledge the importance of\nmolecular codes, and have pro-\nposed the skin Hox code hypothesis\nfor regional specificity of skin and\nskin appendages (Chuong, 1993).\nYet, how are these molecular codes\nset up?\nA morphogenetic gradient, such\nas an Shh gradient, has been used\nto explain dorsal\u2013ventral spinal\ncord determination (Monsoro-Burq\nand Le Douarin, 1999) and ante-\nrior\u2013posterior (A\u2013P) limb bud pat-\nterning (McGlinn and Tabin, 2006).\nHere we will use a recent example\ndescribing how a Wnt 3a gradient\nin adult feather follicles patterns\nepithelial stem cells to form either\nradial or bilateral, symmetric feath-\ners.\nIn the adult bird, there are radially\nsymmetric body feathers and bilat-\nerally symmetric flight feathers.\nFeathers do not contain the bulge\nstructure found in hairs that house\nstem cells. We recently identified\nfeather stem cells located as a con-\ncentric ring sitting at the bottom of\nthe feather follicle (Yue et al., 2005).\nInterestingly, in radially symmetric\nfeathers, the stem cell ring is placed\nhorizontally. In bilaterally symmetric\nfeathers, the stem cell ring tilts to-\nward the anterior rachis position.\nThis topological difference led us to\npropose that there would be a break\nof symmetry in the ramogenic plane\nwhere feather branches start to form\n(Fig. 4). Indeed, in bilaterally sym-\nmetric feathers, we found a Wnt 3a\ngradient from anterior to posterior\npositions that does not exist in radi-\nally symmetric feathers. Flattening\nthe Wnt 3a gradient using RCAS ret-\nrovirus-mediated gene misexpres-\nsion converted bilaterally symmetric\nfeathers to radially symmetric feath-\ners (Yue et al., 2006). A local Wnt 3a\ngradient released from a bead causes\nthe forming barb ridge branches to\nswirl toward the Wnt 3a source.\nSwapping dermal papillae between\nradial and bilaterally symmetric\nfeathers shows that the dermal pa-\npilla determines the gradient config-\nuration and feather symmetry, while\nstem cells can respond to the mor-\nphogenetic gradient to make differ-\nent forms of feathers. This is an\nexcellent example, showing how a\nmicrogradient within a feather fol-\nlicle can set the organ shape.\nPATTERNS THAT CAN BE\nCHANGED IN THE ADULT\nTraveling Wave\nHair follicles go through regenerative\ncycles: they cycle through growth\nPATTERN FORMATION IN SKIN AND SKIN APPENDAGES 285\nBirth Defects Research (Part C) 78:280\u2013291, (2006)\n(anagen), regression (catagen), hair\nshaft shedding (exogen), and rest-\ning phases (telogen) (Paus and\nCotsarelis, 1999; Stenn and Paus,\n2001; Paus and Foitzik, 2004). Visu-\nalizing hair waves is facilitated by\nhair cycle\u2013dependent changes in in-\ntegument pigmentation and timed\nhair loss in nude mice (Militzer,\n2001; Suzuki et al., 2003), Msx2\nnull mice (Ma et al., 2003; Mecklen-\nburg et al., 2005), calcineurin B1\n(Mammucari et al., 2005), etc. As a\nresult, we observe skin regions cy-\ncling through discrete stages, each\nrepresenting a different \u2018\u2018status\u2019\u2019 of\nhair follicle (Fig. 1S and T). The\nregions can appear as waves of dra-\nmatic pattern changes across the\nadult mouse skin.\nMilitzer (2001) analyzedmore than\n400 nude mice on albino (NMRI,\nfoxn1nu) and pigmented (C57BL\/6,\nfoxn1nu) backgrounds for more than\none year. Pink skin turns dark when\nhairs enter anagen III and returns to\npink when anagen is completed. Skin\npigmentation changes travel in a\nwave-like fashion on the skin surface\nof these mice. When mice are young,\nall hair cycles initially synchronize,\nbut with increasing age the hair\ncycles over different regions de-\nsynchronize. Thus, the skin pigment\npattern breaks into distinct stripes\nand patches. As mice age, the\nstripes and patches become nar-\nrower\/smaller and eventually appear\nrandom.\nDramatic traveling hair waves\noccur in the Foxn1nu strain of nude\nmice on the C57BL\/6 background\n(Suzuki et al., 2003). These mutant\nmice have a distinct defect in the\nFoxn1 gene that results in faster\nhair cycling. Thus the dynamic pig-\nmentation pattern changes de-\nscribed above progress faster than\nthose observed in classical nude\nmice. In young mice, the pigmenta-\ntion oscillation takes place synchro-\nnously throughout the skin. The wider\npigmented stripes progress to\nbecome narrower bands as a mice\nage. Some mice (usually more than\nseven months) show narrow,\nroughly evenly-spaced pigmented\nstripes that travel along the trunk;\nhowever, many mice show irregular,\nfragmented, or very wide stripes\n(Fig. 5).\nThe pattern can become more\ncomplex. Ma et al. (2003) reported\n\u2018\u2018cyclic alopecia\u2019\u2019 in Msx2 knockout\nmice. This phenotype is due to the\nfact that hair fibers are defective\nand are dislodged specifically during\nFigure 4. Morphogenetic gradient. Left column shows an idealized radially symmetric\nfeather. Right column shows a bilaterally symmetric feather. A,E: The proximal follicle\nshows ordered compartments of stem cells (orange color), TA cells, and differentiating cells\n(ramogenic zone) (Yue et al., 2005). In radially symmetric feathers, the ring is horizontal.\nIn the bilaterally symmetric feathers, the ring is tilted from zero to about 458. Themolecular\ngradient in the ramogenic zone is shown in shades of blue. B,C: In an open follicle prepara-\ntion, the feather filament cylinder is opened to form a plane. In radially symmetric feathers,\nall new barb ridges form at the same time and in parallel. In bilaterally symmetric feathers,\nthe tilting of the stem cell ring results in a discrepancy of maturation due to the fact that the\nTA cells have to travel (or are displaced) different distances before they reach the ramo-\ngenic zone (m1 and m2). On the anterior side, cells are more mature. The shift in cell posi-\ntion is represented by vectors AB, AC, and AD. D: According to this model, there should be\na molecular gradient along the A\u2013P axis. Indeed, we found a Wnt 3a gradient. Flattening\nthe gradient converted feathers from bilateral to radial symmetry (Yue et al., 2006).\n286 WIDELITZ ET AL.\nBirth Defects Research (Part C) 78:280\u2013291, (2006)\nthe catagen phase. The skin of these\nmice during anagen is black and\nhairy, but during telogen is bald and\nnonpigmented. As the hairs cycle,\nthe alopecic regions reenter anagen\nand regain pigmentation in a pro-\ngressive order. Long-term observa-\ntion of hairy and bald skin regions\nrevealed a \u2018\u2018cyclic alopecia\u2019\u2019 phe-\nnomenon. Hairs within one skin do-\nmain cycle in waves but not with\nhairs in neighboring domains (which\nalso cycle in waves, but with an in-\ndependent rhythm).\nIn essence, the \u2018\u2018traveling stripes\u2019\u2019\nof the Foxn1nu mice are a manifesta-\ntion of the same phenomenon. Notch\n1 activation in keratinocytes can go\nthrough the RBP or calcineurin B1\npathways. Recently, mice with a cal-\ncineurin B1 deletion also showed a\ncyclic alopecia phenotype (Mammu-\ncari et al., 2005). In adult humans,\nmost hair follicle cycles independ-\nently, so there are no wave-like pat-\nterns.\nHormone-Based Changes\nof Appendage Pattern\nSince hair or feather follicles can go\nthrough regenerative cycles, a com-\npletely new type of skin appendage\ncan reform with a new shape and\nsize through a regenerative cycling\nmechanism. This is most obvious in\nsex hormone\u2013dependent changes\n(Mayer et al., 2004). Upon puberty,\nskin appendages in specific regions\nare transformed when sex hor-\nmone (estrogen and androgen)\npathways are activated. Sex ste-\nroids can also affect the melano-\ngenic activity of epidermal melano-\ncytes, giving rise to hormonally-\nbased changes of skin and skin ap-\npendage patterns as evident in\nbirds (Fig. 2A).\nThis is most apparent in tail\nfeathers of hens\/roosters and pea-\nhens\/peacocks. Sexual dimorphism\ncharacteristics are also observed in\nmammals, including humans\n(Wheeler, 1991). In the human\nbeard, axilla, and genital regions,\nhair follicles are transformed from\nthe vellus to the terminal state.\nWith increasing age, the reverse\ntends to occur, leading to andro-\ngenic alopecia. Vellus hairs also can\nbe transformed into unwanted ter-\nminal hairs (e.g., on the upper lip\nand lower legs) when properly\nstimulated by androgens, leading\nto hirsutism. Here, terminal hairs in\nthe frontal and parietal scalp are\naffected, but not those in the occi-\npital region. As a result, the type of\nhairs that form and the region of\nhair growth (hairline) change at dif-\nferent ages. The mechanism con-\ntrolling how scalp and occipital hairs\nrespond to sex hormones is not\nknown, but appears to be mediated\nby differences in dermal papillae,\nwhich exhibit varying response to\nstimulation with androgens or\nestrogens (Randall et al., 2001;\nInui et al., 2002; Conrad et al.,\n2005). In fact, estrogens and estro-\ngen receptor-mediated signaling are\npowerful mediators or even inducers\nof wave pattern formation, namely\nof hair waves in mice (Ohnemus\net al., 2006). Thus, hormonally-\nbased skin lesion patterns are also\nthe consequence of region-specific\ndevelopmental programming.\nEnvironmentally-Based Pattern\nChanges\nChange in light\/dark cycles produced\nby the seasonal lengthening and\nshortening of days or changes in\ntemperature can alter the type or col-\noring of skin appendages. This can\nbe seen in the seasonal (summer\/\nwinter) hair coat variation of horses,\nsnow shoe rabbits, etc. In nature,\nchanges in the length of the light pe-\nriod are translated into changes in\nthe plasma melatonin and prolactin\nlevels, which can trigger animals to\nproduce a longer\/shorter or whiter\/\ndarker coat to improve their chan-\nces for survival during a given sea-\nson (Rose et al., 1987). Now that we\nknow that human and rodent skin\nand hair follicles are extrapituitary\nsites of melatonin synthesis (Slo-\nminski et al., 2002, 2003; Kobaya-\nshi et al., 2005), one wonders to\nwhat extent environmental cues\n(such as the length of the light pe-\nriod) can also affect seasonal changes\nin skin and skin appendage patterns.\nPattern Formation of\/in Skin\nLesions\nSince the skin covers the surface of\nan individual, patterns on the skin\nare the most recognizable. They\nhave been used as diagnostic clues\nto the dermatologist (Ackerman,\n1997; Bolognia et al., 2003; Sterry\net al., 2006). In addition to develop-\nmental and physiological causes,\npatterns on the skin that develop\ncan be due to pathological or artifac-\ntual causes. A multiauthored review\nfeaturing several view points focus-\ning on skin lesion patterns was re-\ncently edited by Dr. Ralf Paus for\nFigure 5. Traveling stripes. A: In the adult mouse, hair follicles go through regenerative\ncycling. They appear as black in the anagen period. In this mutant nude mouse, hair fila-\nments are lost in the telogen period and appear white. This helps us visualize the chang-\ning states of hair follicles, which appear as traveling waves (after Suzuki et al., 2003; Pli-\nkus and Chuong, 2004). Arrows describe the direction of wave propagation. B: Msx2 null\nmice show cyclic alopecia in which hair shafts are dislodged at a specific time of hair\ncycle but can also regenerate. As a result, patches of hairy domains (black) and bald\ndomains (white) are formed. These domains alternate between growth and resting\nphases, and give the impression of traveling stripes. The shape and size of these\ndomains, their relative configuration changes over time, and situation in (A) is a special\nexample of this phenomenon. Based on Ma et al. (2003).\nPATTERN FORMATION IN SKIN AND SKIN APPENDAGES 287\nBirth Defects Research (Part C) 78:280\u2013291, (2006)\nExperimental Dermatology (Chuong\net al., 2006b). Here, we will briefly\nsummarize those discussions.\nLineage, Genetically-Based\nMolecular expression within cells is\nchanged genetically or epigenetically\nduring development. The changes\ncan be transmitted to daughter cells\nbecause they involve somatic muta-\ntions in DNA or are mediated by epi-\ngenetic mechanisms such as X-chro-\nmosome inactivation, DNA methyla-\ntion, etc. This collection of different\npatterns has mainly been studied in\nhuman diseases. The offspring of the\nmutated cells share a similar abnor-\nmality. The distinct phenotypes of\nthese cells thenmanifest themselves\nin the skin. These ectopic changes\nare named Naevus (Happle, 1995)\n(see Glossary). There are several\nstriking examples in which lesions\nare limited to the left or right side of\nthe body, regional segments, check-\nerboard patterns, or linear distribu-\ntions (Fig. 6A) (Happle, 1993, 1995,\n2004). The most striking example in\nthe epidermal lineage is the Blaschko\nlines (Jackson, 1976). A recent case\nof linearly distributed acne turned\nout to be due to a somatic mutation\nin the FGF receptor in one epider-\nmal cell lineage (Munro and Wilkie,\n1998). The mechanism leading to\nthe Blaschko lines is fundamental\nand not limited to humans. When\nearly chicken embryo epidermal cells\n(embryonic day 2 [ED 2]) were la-\nbeled along the dorsal midline with\nreplication-defective virus express-\ning b-galactosidase, their cellular\ndescendents showed multiple paral-\nlel blue lines, resembling Christmas\ntree branches, radiating from the\nmidline across the dorsal skin of late\nchicken embryos (Fig. 6B and C)\n(Chuong et al., 1998). However,\nanalyses of these patterns show that\nformation of feather primordia or\nfeather filaments are not based on\nlineage, but on the local environment\nat the time of formation (Fig. 6D).\nThere are many different types of\nectodermal organs on the integu-\nment. Many of them share morpho-\ngenetic signaling pathways. Pertur-\nbation of one pathway can lead to\nchanges in multiple organs (Plikus\nFigure 6. Genetic mosaicism on the skin. A: Lines of Blaschko. Through X chromosome inactivation, the lineage of epithelia cells can\nbe seen to be distributed in lines horizontal to the A\u2013P axis. Several examples of checkerboard or patch patterns on human skin are\nseen in several human diseases (Happle, 1995, 2004). After Happle\u2019s viewpoint 2 in Chuong et al. (2006). B: Equivalent lines of\nBlaschko in embryonic chicken. Embryos are injected with nonreplicative virus carrying b-galactosidase. C: Line drawing of (B). D: Dif-\nferent cell lineages are represented by different colors. Analyses show that individual feather buds or individual barb ridges are made\nof cells from different lineages, not from a single lineage. Therefore, the local environment at the time of feather morphogenesis is\nmore important than lineage. B\u2013D: From Chuong et al. (1998).\n288 WIDELITZ ET AL.\nBirth Defects Research (Part C) 78:280\u2013291, (2006)\net al., 2004). In humans, when a\nmolecule, such as EDA, that is fun-\ndamental to these processes is mu-\ntated, it can lead to ectodermal dys-\nplasia that affect multiple epithelial\norgans (Bolognia et al., 2003).\nAnatomically- or\nPhysiologically-Based\nDistinct regions such as skin ap-\npendages, skin ridges, cutaneous\nnerves, blood vessels, etc., can con-\ntribute to patterns of skin lesions.\nWhen skin lesions develop, they\nmay follow these obvious anatomi-\ncal borders or follow \u2018\u2018hidden\u2019\u2019 latent\npatterns based on physiological dif-\nferences. Through various pathoge-\nnetic mechanisms, these different\nskin regions may result in different\nsusceptibility to diseases. It is upon\nthis dynamic landscape that skin\nlesions develop, and become dis-\ntributed and shaped.\nArtificial\nHuman behaviors can also cause pat-\nterned lesions. For example, chronic\nsun exposure can lead to the charac-\nteristic ultraviolet (UV)-light-induced\npatterns corresponding to unclothed\nskin regions. Tattoos, skin paintings,\nhair dyes, cosmetic surgery, etc.,\ncan lead to further visible patterned\nchanges on the skin.\nCONCLUSION\nThe skin is an excitable medium. In\ndevelopment, it conducts reactions\namong signaling molecules that\ndetermine the formation of skin\nappendages or the distribution of\nactive melanocytes. In the adult, re-\ngenerative hair cycling provides a\nrich opportunity for the skin to\nrenew itself based on hormonal and\nenvironmental changes. Patterns of\nskin lesions provide diagnostic clues\nto skin or systematic diseases. The\nconvergence of genetic, epigenetic,\nand regenerative events to generate\ncomplex patterns on this very visible\norgan also provides a great experi-\nmental opportunity to study the\nmany unknown mechanisms of bio-\nlogical pattern formation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is based on two of our\nrecent multiauthor reviews (Chuong\nCM, Dhouailly D, Gilmore S, Forest\nL, Shelley WB, Stenn KS, Maini P,\nMichon F, Parimoo S, Cadau S,\nDemongeot J, Zheng Y, Paus R, Hap-\nple R.
