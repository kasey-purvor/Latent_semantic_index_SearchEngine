INTRODUCTION\nGENERALIZED multicarrier code-division multiple ac-cess (GMC-CDMA) has recently received increasing\ninterests for high data rate transmissions [1], [2]. Relying on\nthe precoding redundancy, [1] has shown that signal recovery\nfor GMC-CDMA systems is independent of channel null (deep\nfade) locations. Hence, for uncoded systems, GMC-CDMA\noutperforms the conventional MC-CDMA in frequency-se-\nlective fading channels. As an orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (OFDM)-based technique, GMC-CDMA is very\nsensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) [3]. A good CFO\nestimator is acquired to improve the overall system perfor-\nmance. In literature, many data-aided and nondata-aided CFO\nestimators have been reported for multicarrier systems (e.g.,\n[6]\u2013[10]). However, very few publications so far have addressed\nexploiting hidden pilots for the CFO estimation. This motivated\nus to develop a novel CFO estimator by using hidden pilots.\nOriginally, techniques using hidden pilots were proposed for\nlow-complexity estimation of static channels (or slowly time-\nvarying channels) in single-carrier systems (see [4] and [5]). In\nthis letter,wedeploythehiddenpilots in theGMC-CDMAsystem\nfor the accurate CFO estimation. The proposed CFO estimator\nconsists of two subestimators operating in the frequency domain.\nUsing the cyclic-statistics (CS) algorithm, the first subestimator\nis able to mitigate the normalized CFO (NCFO) to a small error\nManuscript received April 21, 2005; revised May 26, 2005.

This error is mainly from the quantization noise in the\nCS-based subestimator. The second subestimator is based on the\nlinear-regression (LR) algorithm. It is shown that the LR-based\nestimator performs well for the case of small NCFO and is a\ngoodcompensation to theCS-basedestimator.Then,weusecom-\nputer simulation to compare the proposed estimators with the\npulse-shaping [8], CP-based [7], and null-subcarriers-based [9]\napproaches. Simulation results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms the others.\nII.

In the GMC-CDMA system,\nis used for the user signatures and also introduces the precoding\nredundancy [1]. Letting , we construct\nanother block precoder with the size of . This pre-\ncoder is used to precode the hidden-pilot blocks , with the\ninput\u2013output relationship of . Then, we feed the\nsum of and to the CP-OFDM modulator .

The output of CP-OFDM\nmodulator (or transmitted block) is given by\n(1)\nwhere is usually formed by a Walsh matrix in\nGMC-CDMA systems. The detail description on how to obtain\nthe output (1) can be found in [1].\nThe transmitted blocks experience the propagation channel\n, where denotes the upper\nbound of the channel order.

Normally,\nfor the CP length , the interblock interference (IBI)\npart can be removed by discarding CP at the receiver, and the\nremaining part becomes\n(3)\nwhere diag\nis the circulant channel matrix addressed in [1], and\nis the corresponding noise vector. We perform the DFT on\nand obtain the frequency-domain blocks as\n(4)\nwhere , and are the intercar-\nrier interferences (ICIs) contributed by the information symbols\nand pilots, respectively; , where denotes the\nchannel frequency-response (CFR) with the size of , and\ndenotes the diagonal matrix with in its diagonal. Then,\nwe have the following three comments on (4).\n1) The pilot blocks are assumed to be invariant with respect\nto the block index . So, we can omit the index in pilot-\nrelated terms and for convenience.\n2) The ICI term is contributed by and, thus, has the\nzero mean and is uncorrelated for the block index [3].\n3) When and are known at the receiver, the CFO and pilot\nblocks can be eliminated from (3). Then, the zero-forcing\n(ZF) equalization can be employed in the frequency do-\nmain. Reference [1] has shown that has at most\nzeros on its diagonal, so the signal recovery is independent\nof channel null (deep fade) locations only when\nand any rows of are linear independent.\nLater on, we present how to use hidden pilots for the CFO\nestimation.\nIII. ESTIMATION OF CFO\nA. CS-Based Estimator\nConsider the autocorrelation of the received blocks (4) as\n(5)\nBased on the comments 1) and 2) in Section II, it is easy to\nobtain\n(6)\nwhere\n(7)\nWe can see that the matrix is constant with respect to the\nlag . Therefore, is a periodic function of\nwith the period of by assuming that the matrix is\nnot zero (justification of this assumption will be given later). For\n, we perform the DFT on (6) and obtain (see\n[11] for DFT property)\n(8)\nwhere\nFor , the norm of is given by\n(9)\nwhich achieves its maximum along the direction only when\nreaches its maximum, i.e.,\n. Since is an integer, the maximum of\nshould be located at\n(10)\nwhere denotes the integer floor. Hence, we can first deter-\nmine such a by searching the maximum of\nover , and then, estimate the NCFO via\n(11)\nThen, we provide the following three comments.\n1) Estimation Range: For , the maximum\nidentifiable NCFO, denoted by , can be derived from (11)\n(12)\nDue to the effect of frequency fold, the estimate range of CFO\nis given by .\n2) Quantization Noise: Since is an integer, the relation-\nship between and can be derived from (10) and (11) as\n(13)\nwhere is the quantization noise. This noise may\nincur the CFO estimation error as\n(14)\nCertainly, this error can be further mitigated by increasing .\n3) Low-Complexity Approach: The computation com-\nplexity of the CS-based approach is mainly from the DFT\noperation and autocorrelation. Particularly, (8) needs the com-\nplexity of for the fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) operation. The low-complexity approach is\nintended to reduce the computation cost of FFT by considering\nthe trace of as\nTr Tr (15)\nwhere Tr denotes the trace of . We find that is a Her-\nmitian matrix, and thus, Tr . Then, the DFT of (15) is\ngiven by\nTr Tr\n(16)\nFor , the absolute value of Tr is given by\nTr Tr\n(17)\nThen, the NCFO can be estimated by searching the maximum of\nTr .

LR-Based Estimator\nThe linear regression estimator is based on the following\nequation:\n(18)\nwhere is a Hermitian matrix. The trace of\nis given by\nTr Tr (19)\nDue to Tr should be positive. So, we can obtain\nthe phase of Tr using\nTr\n(20)\nwhere is a function to obtain the phase of , for\nis the period of the function\n.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE)\nwas used to benchmark the CFO estimation performance. Here,\nis the number of Monte Carlo trials. The frequency-selective\nfading channel was modeled as a finite impulse response (FIR)\nfilter with the maximum order of . Each tap was randomly\ngenerated according to the Rayleigh distribution with the vari-\nance of . The block precoder was formed by the\nWalsh matrix. The parameters of GMC-CDMA systems\nweregivenby .Theinforma-\ntion-bearingsymbolsweredrawnfromthequadraturephase-shift\nkeying (QPSK) constellation with the equal probability. The sub-\ncarrier spacing of 312.5 kHz was the same as HIPERLAN\/2\n[13]. Elements in the pilotblock were identical. The pilot-to-in-\nformation power ratio was given by . The signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) is defined by the average received symbol energy to\nnoise [14]. Based on the above parameters, we find that\nthe block results in eight nonzero elements with equal ampli-\ntudes. As shown in Section III-C, the CFO identifiability can be\nguaranteed by employing this kind of pilot design.\nTest Case 1: This experiment examines the estimation\nperformance as a function of NCFO with SNR and 15\ndB, respectively. The RMSE results were obtained by taking\nthe average of Monte Carlo trials. Each trial col-\nlected GMC-CDMA blocks for the CFO estimation.\nFig. 1(a) shows that the RMSE for the CS-based approach is\nvery stable (around ). This result has a good match\nwith the quantization error in (14). In the range of large NCFO\n(e.g., ), we can observe that the LR-based approach\ncannot offer a good estimation due to the relatively short .\nThe estimation performance improves significantly with the\ndecrease of NCFO. When NCFO is small (e.g., ), the\nLR-based approach outperforms the CS-based approach.\nTest Case 2: In order to indicate the performance-complexity\ntradeoff, we examine the RMSE results as a function of data\nrecord length (DRL) with and the typical SNR\ndB. Fig. 1(b) shows that RMSE for CFO estimators decreases\nrapidly with the increase of . They can achieve the best per-\nformance offered by the pulse-shaping-based approach [8] only\nusing blocks.\nTest Case 3: To evaluate the subestimators for different\nSNR cases, we plot the RMSE results in Fig. 2 with the NCFO\nand the DRL blocks.Fig. 2 shows that\nthe CS-based subestimator is not sensitive to the SNR. The\nRMSE result for the LR-based estimator becomes stable and\noffers the best performance for SNR dB. Interestingly, we\nobserve that the low-complexity CS-based approach offers the\nsame performance as the CS-based approach. In order to com-\npare with state-of-the-art approaches, we also plot the RMSE\nresults for the pulse-shaping, CP-based [7] and null-subcarriers\n(NS)-based [9] CFO estimators. Fig. 2 shows that the proposed\nestimators outperform the pulse-shaping-based and CP-based\nestimator. For the fair comparison with the NS-based approach,\nwe investigate the OFDM system with the same setup as the\nGMC-CDMA system.

Fig. 2 shows that the NS-based approach is sensitive\nto the SNR (particularly in the low SNR range). The proposed\napproaches also outperform the NS-based one.\nV. CONCLUSION\nUtilizing the hidden pilots, this letter has proposed a novel\nCFO estimators for GMC-CDMA in unknown frequency-selec-\ntive channels. It has been established that the CFO is identifi-\nable in the frequency domain by employing the CS-based and\nLR-based approaches. Both theoretical and simulation results\nhave shown the excellent estimation performance of the pro-\nposed CFO estimator.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z. Wang and G. B.
