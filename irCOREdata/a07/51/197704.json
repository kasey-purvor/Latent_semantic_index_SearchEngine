A cDNA library of adult S. mansoni was used as a template to \namplify the coding sequences of these fragments which were expressed in bacterial \nexpression system using the vector pRSETB. \n \nSM-CRT sub-fragments (except those with N-terminal domain) were shown to bind \ncalcium using \u201cStains-all\u201d stain or interact with 45Ca2. With the exception of the P-domain, \nSM-CRT sub-fragments bound and inhibited C1q-dependent haemolysis in vitro. \n \nIn S. mansoni infected mice, specific antibodies against the carboxy-terminal part of SM-\nCRT appeared 46 days p.i., while antibodies against the N-terminal part of SM-CRT  were \ndetectable  at 59 days p.i.. Cercarial Transformation Fluid (CTF) and Solube Egg Antigens \n(SEA) specific antibodies were detectable at day 12 p.i.. Use for diagnosis  of S. mansoni  \nin  humans, CTF and SEA showed 89.7% sensitivity, while the PC-domain of SM-CRT \nshowed sensitivity of 71.1% (the highest SM-CRT sub-fragment sensitivity). When testing \nthe cross-reactivity with sera drawn from patients with other diseases, SM-CRT N-domain \nshowed the lowest degree of cross-reactivity. Analysing non-endemic controls, a specificity \n>95% was shown for all of the antigens used.  When using endemic controls, SM-CRT N-\ndomain revealed the highest degree of specificity (94.7%), while SEA revealed 26.3% \nspecificity and CTF showed 68.4% specificity. \n \nBALB\/c mice immunised with recombinant SM-CRT achieved a 49.9% (P >0.05)  \nreduction in Schistosoma adult worm numbers (on exposure to S. mansoni cercariae), \ncomparing  to the non-immunised mice. The eggs numbers in the liver decreased by 41.8% \nin the immunised mouse group with a non-significant statistical difference. The immunised \nmice responded to SM-CRT immunisation by producing specific IgG1 and IgG2a, \nreflecting a Th1\/Th2 with a predominance of  Th2 immune response profile.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                               \niv \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nAt first, I would like to express my deep thanks to my supervisor Professor Wilhelm \nSchwaeble, Professor of Immunology.

\n1.1 Schistosomiasis \nSchistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease caused by digenetic trematodes belonging to \nthe Schistosomatidae family. The genus Schistosoma includes several species, five of \nwhich affect human beings; mansoni, japonicum, haemtobium, mekongi and intercalatum. \nThe first three species are the most widely distributed (Sturrock 2001, McManus& Loukas \n2008).   \n \nSchistosomiasis is the second most frequent parasitic disease affecting mankind and ranks \nimmediately after malaria (WHO 1993, Croft et al. 2003, King et al. 2005). \nSchistosomiasis is endemic in 74 countries, distributed across the Old World. S. mansoni  is \nfound in sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt, the Middle East and South American countries \nespecially Brazil. S. japonicum is endemic in China and the Philippines. Both S. mansoni \nand S. japonicum cause intestinal schistosomiasis, whereas S. haemtobium is prevalent in \nsub-Saharan Africa and causes urinary schistosomiasis (Waine& McManus 1997, Chitsulo \net al. 2004). \n \nNearly 200 million people harbour Schistosoma infections, of whom about 20 million \nsuffer from severe morbidity, and about 600 million people are at risk of being infected. \nSub-Saharan states harbour nearly 85% of the affected persons and two thirds of the at risk \nindividuals (Engels et al. 2002, Chitsulo et al. 2004).  Schistosomiasis is estimated to cause  \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n2 \n \naround 280,000 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa alone each year due to haematemesis and \nrenal failure complicated by the disease (van der Werf et al. 2003). \n \nIn spite of the efforts of control programmes and the changes in Schistosoma distribution \nover countries, the overall number of infected people has nearly stayed the same for over 50 \nyears. This is attributed to overpopulation, construction of new water projects, immigration \nand the fact that only a few countries have carried out successful control programmes \n(Savioli et al. 2004a& b, Chitsulo et al. 2000). My introduction will mainly focus on the \nsubject organism of my thesis, S. mansoni. \n \n1.2 Life cycle of Schistosoma  \nSchistosoma needs two hosts to complete its complex life cycle; an aquatic intermediate \nsnail and a mammalian final host. The cycle is similar among different Schistosoma species \nwith species specific differences in intermediate hosts species and the main target organs of \nthe adult parasites inside their mammalian host. \n \nAdult male and female S. mansoni and S. japonicum live in pairs in the mesenteric venous \nplexus around the large intestine, while S. haematobium adults inhabit the venous plexus \nsurrounding urinary bladder. The male carries its partner female in its gynaecophoric canal. \nThe adult male is shorter and thicker than its partner. Parasite life span is about 3-8 years. \nThe female Schistosoma deposits its eggs within the narrowest blood vessels that it can \nreach. The S. mansoni egg has a lateral spine while an S. hematobium egg posses a terminal \nspine. Eggs pass through the walls of these veins, then cross the intestinal wall to be \nexcreted with the stool in the case of S. mansoni and S. japonicum, whereas S. \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n3 \n \nhaematobium eggs pass into the bladder to reach the external environment in the urine \n(Wilson& Coulson 1986, Wilson 1987).  \n \nUpon reaching fresh water, the egg hatches immediately stimulated by the hypotenicity of \nthe water, releasing a free living ciliated miracidium which must find a suitable \nintermediate snail host within two days, otherwise it will perish. Water snails of the genus \nBiomphalaria are the intermediate host for S. mansoni, Onchomelania species for S. \nJaponicum, while S. haematobium uses Bulinus snails as intermediate hosts. Once \nmiracidiae reached their intermediate host, they lose their cilia and multiply asexually, \nchanging into primary sporocysts which then develop into secondary sporocysts. Secondary \nsporocysts migrate to the snail\u2019s digestive gland to transform into cercariae. One \nmiracidium may generate thousands of cercariae in one month. Cercariae are released from \nthe snail host and are able to move independently by undulation of their forked tail. \nCercariae have to find their definitive host within 24-48 hours otherwise they will perish. \nHumans are the definitive host for S. mansoni and S. haematobium, whereas S. japonicum \nmay have also other mammalian definitive hosts in addition to man such as cattle, horse \nand sheep (Wilson 1987).  \n \nThe cercaria is a positive  phototropic, thermotropic and chemotropic organism responding \nto free fatty acid in the skin. It penetrates the skin by aid of the enzymes secreted from its \nacetebuler gland and movement of its tail (Stirewalt 1974, Haas et al. 1997, Fishelson et al, \n1992, Brachs& Haas 2008). Within 1.5 minutes, the cercaria enters the human skin (Haas \n& Haeberlein 2009).  \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n4 \n \n \n Figure1: Life cycle of Schistosoma (This figure is a modified version of a figure \npublished by King 2009). \nLarge intestine  \n   \n Urinary bladder \n                Liver  \n(The site of adult maturation) \nAdult Schistosoma couples             Migration to left heart  \nSchistosomula pass to lung \nCercariae \nSporocysts \nMiracidia Eggs    Snails \nEggs should reach fresh water to                  \n             complete cycle \n  Stool                           Urine     \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n5 \n \nUpon invasion,  cercaria loses its tail and glycocalyx membrane  and  undergoes  several  \nmorphological,  biochemical  and  structural  changes  to transform into a schistosomulum \n(Samuelson& Caulfield 1982, Samuelson et al.1984, Mountford& Trottein, 2004). The \nschistosomulum leaves the dermis within a time span of few minutes to several hours after \nthe depletion of glycogen stores (McKerrow& Salter 2002). \n \nThe schistosomulum passes through local blood or lymphatic vessels to be carried \npassively by the venous blood flow to the heart. From the heart, it reaches the lung and \nreturns again to the left heart to be carried with systemic circulation to reach the liver \nsinusoids where it persists throughout its maturation into the adult stage (Wilson et al. \n1978, Wilson& Lawson 1980).  \n \nAfter reaching maturity, the pairing between male and female Schistosoma takes place and \nboth of male and female partners move from the liver through the blood stream to reach \ntheir final habitats. The adult female lays several hundred fertilised eggs per day \napproximately 1.5-3 months post primary infection.  The complete life cycle spans a period \nof about 1.5-3 months depending on temperature of the aquatic environment and the host\u2019s \nimmune response (Wilson& Coulson 1986, Wilson 1987). About 50% of the deposited S. \nmansoni eggs succeed in passing to the outer environment with the faeces while the rest \nremains in the blood stream to be trapped in other organs, especially the liver, where they \ncause granulomatous inflammatory reactions with its severe sequelae (Cheever 1968).  \n \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n6 \n \n1.3 Clinical picture of Schistosoma mansoni \nMany morbidity symptoms and signs caused by Schistosoma have socio-economic and \npublic health effects (King et al. 2005). The pathogenesis of schistosomiasis occurs in two \nstages; an acute and a chronic stage.  \n  \n1.3.1 Acute Schistosoma infection   \nAcute Schistosomiasis mainly affects na\u00efve persons who catch the infection for the first \ntime, whereas people living in endemic areas usually do not show such symptoms and signs \n(Evengard et al. 1990, Rabello 1995, Bica et al. 2000). Individuals who are living in \nendemic Schistosoma areas might be armed with mechanisms to alleviate their immune \nresponse towards the invading cercariae such as synthesis of IgG4 an infection blocking \nantibody class (Hussain et al. 1992) or by release of protective cytokines such as IL-12 \n(King et al. 1998). \n \nThe acute stage is associated with dermatitis which occurs in a time span between a few \nhours to one week after cercariae penetration. Acute infection is often characterised by an   \nimmediate hypersensitivity type response due to activation of the dermal mast cells and \nbasophiles triggered by immunoglobulins of the class IgE which specifically respond to the \nreleased serine proteases from penetrating cercariae. This leads to itching and to \nmaculopapular rashes (Farid et al. 1987, Capron& Capron 1994, Verwaerde et al. 1988).  \n \nApproximately 3-7 days after infection, schistosomulum reaches the lung causing allergic \npneumonitis as part of the immediate hypersensitivity response against serine proteases \nreleased by the schistosomulum. There are coughing, leukocyte infiltration of the lung and \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n7 \n \neosinophilia. These symptoms usually disappear within 1-2 weeks (Farid et al. 1987, \nWeltman & Senft, 1981, Capron & Capron 1994, Verwaerde et al. 1988). \n \nApproximately 1-3 months after infection, when adult worms mature and start to lay eggs, \ntypical Katayama fever symptoms caused by an acute generalized hypersensitivity response \nare observed in most na\u00efve patients (de Jesus et al. 2002, Ross et al. 2007). There are non-\nspecific symptoms such as fever, malaise, cough, headache, myalgia, fatigue, diarrhoea and \nabdominal pain which are more sever in children than in adults (Rabello 1995). Most of the \naffected people recover spontaneously 2-10 weeks later (Gazzinelli et al. 1985, Hiatt et al. \n1979, Rocha et al. 1995). These symptoms could be attributed to formation of circulating \nimmune complex in response to the released Schistosoma antigens inducing the release of \npro-inflammatory cytokines (Ross et al. 2002, Bottieau et al. 2006, Visser et al. 1995, de \nJesus et al. 2002). Katayama fever is more common with S. japonicum than S. mansoni due \nto higher egg depositions of the former species (Ross et al. 2001).  \n \n1.3.2 Chronic Schistosoma infection and complications    \nThe chronic stage of schistosomiasis occurs several years after primary infection and when \neffective treatment has not been used. Most of the pathological manifestations occur as a \nconsequence of egg deposition in the tissues, especially the liver and intestine with \ninduction of inflammatory immune response (Caldas et al. 2008). \n \n1.3.2.1 Intestinal schistosomiasis    \nMost of  infected individuals living in the endemic areas are more or less asymptomatic \nduring the  intestinal schistosomiasis stage (Vennervald et al. 1998).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n8 \n \nThe passage of the deposited eggs through the intestinal wall causes pathological lesions \naffecting mainly the lower large intestine. There is granulomatous inflammation associated \nwith congestion, ulcers and pseudopolyps (Cheever et al. 1978, Farah& Nyindo 1997). \nAbdominal pain or discomfort, anorexia and bloody or non bloody diarrhoea are the \ncommon symptoms (Gryseels 1988, Elliott 1996).  \n \n1.3.2.2 Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis  \nChronicity of infection is accompanied by continuous deposition of more eggs, which \naccumulate in the pre-sinusoid space of the liver where they evoke granulomatous \ninflammation mainly induced by protolytic enzymes and other soluble antigens secreted by \nthe eggs. Granuloma formation is the consequence of a Th2-dependent delayed \nhypersensitivity reaction. The granuloma is formed by CD4+ cells, eosinophils, plasma \ncells, multinucleated giant cells and macrophages. After the inflammation subsides, the \ngranuloma induces a periportal fibrosis, called Symmers\n, \nclay pipe-stem fibrosis. Around 8-\n10% of patients suffering from S. mansoni and japonicum progress to this form of fibrosis \nwithin 5-15 years. Periportal fibrosis is the most serious late complication of Schistosoma \ninfection and is responsible for portal hypertension with subsequent complications such as \noesophageal varices, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites and fatal gastro-intestinal \nbleeding (Cheever et al. 1978, Boros& Warren 1970).  \n \n1.3.2.3 Ectopic schistosomiasis \nSchistosoma  eggs as well as adult parasites may find their  way also to other distant sites \nand cause granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis, for example in the cerebral or spinal \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n9 \n \nvenous plexus  to cause transverse myelitis (Ferrari 2004) or in the lung generating  cor-\npulmonal and pulmonary hypertension (Lambertucci 1993).  \n \n1.4  Schistosomiasis control \nDependent on funds for the treatment, control of schistosomiasis is possible, even though a   \ncomplete eradication is not easily achieved (Bergquist et al. 2002). Successful control \nprogrammes need a sustained long-term commitment far in excess of twenty years \n(Chitsulo et al. 2000). Egypt is one of the countries which has a well designed, successful \nand continued national anti-schistosomiasis control programme (Bergquist 2008). \n \nThe main challenges in controlling the parasite are the ubiquitous presence of the \nintermediate snail hosts, the inefficiency of primary health care measures and the lack of \nfunds in many endemic regions where people have to rely on utilizing infected water to \nmaintain their daily life activities (WHO 2001, Ximenes et al. 2000,  Gazzinelli et al. \n2006).  \n \ni) Diagnosis  \nDiscovery of infected persons is an essential component of any national control programme \nwhich aims to eradicate the infection source (Sturrock 2001). Diagnosis is discussed with \ndetail in the diagnosis section. \n \nii) Chemotherapy  \nThe introduction of praziquantel (PZ) was a major milestone achievement of the national \nprogrammes for control of this disease (Bergquist 2008). It is easily administrated, effective \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n10 \n \nand posses a long lasting effect on reducing morbidity (WHO 2002, Magnussen 2003 and \nSavioli et al. 2004a&b). The main disadvantage of PZ is that it does not prevent re-\ninfection and thus, it is required that it is to be taken for an unforeseeable period (WHO \n2002, Gryseels 1996). \n  \niii) Sanitary measures  \nThe provision of clean water supplies and the establishment of sanitary measures in  the \nendemic areas protect people from using infected water and hence affect the disease \ndistribution and incidence (WHO 1993). \n \niv) Targeting of the intermediate snail host  \nBetween 1930 and 1985, control of schistosomiasis mainly depended on the use of \nmolluscicides and antimony-based prescriptions for the treatment of patients (Engels et al. \n2002). The most widely used molluscicides is niclosamide (Andrews et al. 1982). Use of \npredators or competitor snails to substitute molluscicides, has achieved promising results \nreducing the numbers of intermediate host snails (Giboda et al. 1997). Drainage of \nirrelevant water streams and changes in the irrigation systems to provide unsuitable \nenvironmental conditions for the multiplication of intermediates host snail have been \neffective in limiting Schistosoma dissemination (Bergquist 2002). Snail control has, now, a \ndiminished importance in the overall control programme due to the relatively high cost of \nthe molluscicides, their environmental side effects and the availability of PZ (Sturrock \n2001, Bergquist 2002). \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n11 \n \nv) Health education   \nHealth education accompanied with other environmental measures gives good results \n(Gazzinelli et al. 2006). The persons most at risk such as school children and farmers are \nsupplied with general information about the Schistosoma life cycle, effects of the disease \non their health and precautions to avoid catching the infection and they are encouraged to \nattend for regular examinations of stool and urine samples (Bergquist 2002). The \nprogrammes should be directed to different cultural sectors of the community (Parker et al. \n2004).  \n \nvi) Topical chemotherapy  \nThe use of topical drugs with cercaricidal effects could be a part of the measures which \ncombat Schistosoma. N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) is a topical lipid therapy which \nkills cercariae in the skin of animals providing a high level of protection and achieving \ngood results also in humans (Ramaswamy et al. 2003). It should be applied before exposure \nto potentially infected water (Haas& Haeberlein 2009). \n \n1.5 Immunopathology and immune response of schistosomiasis   \nThe degree of severity of Schistosoma morbidity is affected by many factors; the host \nimmune response towards Schistosoma (Mentink-Kane et al. 2004), the multiplicity of \ninfection (Kabatereine et al. 2003), the period of exposure (Booth et al. 2004), the presence \nof other infectious agents (Kamal et al. 2004) and the genetic background of both the host \nand the infecting Schistosoma (Chevillard et al. 2003).  \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n12 \n \n1.5.1 Immune response to migrating schistosomulum \nThe excretory\/secretory (ES) products which can be released within the first 3 hours by \ninfecting cercariae, are less effective in stimulating the proliferation of lymphoid cells than \nsoluble whole schistosomula extracts (Mountford et al. 1995). ES products facilitate \nmigration of cerceriae in the skin (Fallon et al. 1996). ES products mediate the \ndegranulation of mast cells to release mediators such as histamine and IL-4 in vitro \n(Machado et al. 1996). When cercariae migrate through skin, inflammatory cells, including \ndendertic cells (DC) are attracted to the site of infection which, at a later stage, mature \nevidenced by the de novo expression of CD86 and MHC-II (Angeli et al. 2001). Upon \nactivation, DC directs Th2 polarization (Jenkins& Mountford 2005, d\u2019Ostiani et al. 2000). \nDCs are involved in the activation of CD8+ cells (Bennett et al. 1998). \n \n1.5.2 Immunopathology of acute schistosomiasis  \nAcute schistosomiasis is rare in people living in endemic infection zones, because they are \nexposed to early infection, and a baby born to an infected mother, becomes sensitized to \nSchistosoma antigens in utero or by breast milk from infected mothers (King et al. 1998, \nMalhotra et al. 1997, Montesano et al. 1999).  Immunoglobulins specific to antigens \npresent on adult parasite or eggs of the classes; IgG, IgM and IgE are detectable at similar \nlevels during either acute or chronic stages of the infection (Rabello 1995,   Kanamura et al. \n1979). \n \nIn the acute stage of infection, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) show \nsignificant higher proliferation in response to soluble egg antigen (SEA) and soluble worm \nantigen preparations (SWAP) than the proliferation seen in chronic patients. Cytokine \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n13 \n \nprofiles are mixed between Th1 and Th2 phenotypes with Th1 predominance with IFN-\u03b3 \nreaching its peak four months after infection. IL-5 responses towards specific parasite \nantigens are found in acutely infected patients, while IL-10 is only detected at low \nconcentrations (Malaquias et al. 1997, Montenegro et al. 1999, de Jesus et al. 2002). \n \n1.5.3 Immunopathology of chronic schistosomiasis  \nMost of the morbidity features of chronic schistosomiasis depend on the host\u2019s T cell \nimmune response against parasite eggs (Abath et al. 2006). During the chronic stage of \nSchistosoma infection, the Th2 cytokine profile generally mounts inflammatory responses \nwhich are responsible for most of the pathophysiological  manifestations of this stage of the \ndisease (Hoffmann et al. 2000). PBMC respond strongly to both SEA and SWAP as the \npatients move on from intestinal to early of hepatosplenic stage. During late hepatosplenic \nstage of the disease, patients neither respond to SEA or SWAP (Gazzinelli et al. 1985). In \nthe late hepatosplenic stage, cytokine profiles are variable, predominantly of the Th1 \nphenotype in some cases (Mwatha et al. 1998) or of a Th2 profile in other cases (de Jesus et \nal. 2004). \n  \n1.5.4 Schistosoma granuloma \nGranulomas forming around parasite eggs are the most remarkable manifestation of \nschistosomiasis (Stadecker et al. 2004). The granuloma results from a cell-mediated \ndelayed hypersensitivity response occurring around trapped parasitic eggs. It is formed \nfrom various types of cells; CD4+, CD8+, eosinophils, macrophages, fibroblast  and \nneutrophils which are held together by a fibrous matrix (Boros& Warren 1970, Grzych et \nal. 1991, Sandor et al. 2003). It may cause inflammatory necrosis which can heal leaving \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n14 \n \nlarge deposits of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMPs), and then this scar tissue is in turn \nsubstituted by normal cells. Fibrosis, which is a pathological condition, results from \nabnormally heavy and cross-linked depositions of ECMPs in the granulomsa tissue (Kaplan \net al. 1998, Wynn et al. 1997). ECMPs are produced by the myofibroblast satellite cells, \nwhich divide and multiply in response to IL-13, IL-4 and TGF-\u00df (Postlethwaite et al. 1988, \nTiggelman et al. 1995a& b) and are inhibited by INF-\u03b3 (Mallat et al. 1995, Rockey& \nChung 1994). Fibrosis rather than the size of the granuloma determines the severity of \nhuman disease (Brunet et al. 1998). The granuloma and fibrosis are regulated by \nindependent mechanisms as shown by IL-4 neutralization leading to a decrease of fibrosis \nwithout affecting the size of the granuloma (Cheever et al. 1992& 1994, Cheever& Yap \n1997). \n  \nGranuloma formation has multiple effects on both the host and the parasite. From the stand \npoint of the parasite, the granuloma may facilitate the passage of eggs across the intestinal \nwall to the gut lumen to be secreted and complete the life cycle of the parasite. This is \nevidenced by low egg output of infected CD4+T cell deficient mice (Doenhoff  1997,  \nCheever et al. 1999) or in immunocompromised patients, for example in individuals \nsuffering from AIDS (Karanja et al. 1997).  For the host, it forms a physical barrier which \nhinders penetration of the toxic compounds produced by the parasite eggs into the \nsurrounding tissue (Doenhoff et al. 1981& 1986, Dunne& Doenhoff 1983, Fallon& Dunne \n1999). \n \n In humans, granuloma formation can be observed around 8 weeks after infection, a period \nwhen down-modulation occurs and the infection enters into a chronic stage in most of the \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n15 \n \naffected individuals. Patients who fail to mount this immuno-modulation progress directly \nto the hepatosplenomegally stage of the disease (Domingo& Warren 1968, Montesano et \nal. 1990). \n \n1.5.5 Schistosoma infection and co-infection    \n Schistosoma infection increases the severity and susceptibility to other infectious diseases \n(Secor 2005), the most important example in Egypt is hepatitis B and C, where patients \nsuffering from both, show a significantly higher degree of morbidity than patients with \nvirus hepatitis alone and the Th2 polarization caused by Schistosoma infection counteracts \nthe Th1 immune response required to overcome virus infection (Kamal et al. 2004, El-\nKady et al. 2005).   \n \n1.6  Human resistant against Schistosoma  infection                          \nThe extend of human resistance against Schistosoma infection is difficult to define (Hagan \net al. 1998) and the mechanisms which are responsible for immune protection against \nSchistosoma infection within a population need to be better understood.  Identification of \nsuch protective mechanisms may help to understand immune profiles required to design an \neffective ani-Schistosoma vaccine (Hewitson et al. 2005). Factors that influence the \ndevelopment human immunity against Schistosoma infection include age, severity of the \nimmune response, supportive chemotherapy and genetic factors.   \n \na) Age related immunity in untreated and treated communities \nA huge number of studies in endemic communities show that the infection load is higher in \nyounger children than in adults pointing to the role of age in the development of resistance \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n16 \n \nagainst parasite infection. The infection peaks at teenage age and then decreases afterwards, \nbut in higher infected areas, it occurs earlier and with higher severity as reported in many \nstudies, for example for S. haematobium infection in Gambia (Woolhouse et al. 1991) and \nZimbabwe (Mutapi et al. 1997) and S. mansoni in Kenya (Fulford et al. 1992).  \n \nThis difference in susceptibility to infection between the adult and children might be \nattributed to many factors: \n \n i) Pattern of water exposure  \nThe duration and behaviour in contact with water varies between children and adults and \nthis could partially explain the higher rate of infection in the children sector (Chandiwana \n1987, Chandiwana et al. 1991, Demeure et al. 1993, Fulford et al. 1996).  \n \nii) Hormonal effects  \nDuring puberty, some of the physiological changes that occur in the human body could \nalter the host parasite relationship hindering Schistosoma metabolism and development \n(Butterworth et al. 1994, Fulford et al. 1998, Capron 1992). This was proven in \nexperimental animals, where testosterone was found to affect the development of \nSchistosoma (Nakazawa et al. 1997).  \n \niii) Immune response development \n During puberty, the innate immune response becomes intensified by increasing thickness \nof the skin, high depositions of subcutaneous fat and alternations of the skin fatty acids.  \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n17 \n \nAll these factors may hinder the cercariae penetration and migration through the skin \n(Kurtis et al. 2006).  \nBlocking antibodies could explain the higher susceptibility of young children to re-\ninfection than older children and adults (Dunne& Mountford 2001). Younger children \ndevelop antibodies against egg carbohydrate antigens which cross-react with schistosomula \nglycoproteins (Mazza et al. 1990, Langley et al. 1994). In vitro experiments have proven an \nability of such blocking immunoglobulins to prevent schistosomulum killing mediated by \neosinophils (Khalife et al. 1989). Blocking anti-egg carbohydrate antibodies were detected \nin many groups studied. In Kenya, the younger children show high levels of IgG2 and IgM \n(Butterworth et al. 1985& 1988, Dunne et al. 1988) and in Brazil, IgG2 and IgG4 were \nfound in the infected individuals (Demeure et al. 1993). Hagan et al. (1991) discovered that \nIgE specific against S. haematobium adult and egg antigens is significantly higher in older \nchildren and adults who show lower levels of re-infection load. In case of S. mansoni, IgE \nspecific against the adult worm was positively correlated with resistance against re-\ninfection in adults and older children, whereas IgM, IgG2 and IgG4 are correlated with \nhigher susceptibility to infection (Dunne et al. 1992, Rihet et al. 1991& 1992).  \n \nb) Length of exposure to Schistosoma infection and the development of immunity \nThe most protective mechanism of defence is accumulated acquired immunity (Dunne&  \nMountford 2001). This was made clear by Satti et al. (1996) in Sudan, who studied two \ngroups of adults who clean the water canals. One group was exposed for a long period and \nthe other was only recently exposed. After one year of successful PZ treatment for both \ngroups, the second group had double the load of infection, despite both groups being \nexposed under the same circumstances.  \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n18 \n \nRegardless of age factor, people who are exposed to the infection for a long time and are  \nresistant showed higher IgE and IgG1 against the whole worm antigens (Satti et al. 1996) \nor against particular Schistosoma antigens for example, S.mansoni 28-kD glutathione-S-\ntransferase (Grzych et al. 1993) and  22 kDa Schistosoma antigen (Dunne et al. 1992).  \n \nc) Chemotherapy and modulation of the immune response in the direction of \nresistance  \nChemotherapy can modulate the immune reactions against the parasite by abolishing the \nsuppressive effects of Schistosoma infection on the immune system. Treatment also kills \nparasites inside host blood vessels causing the release of novel parasitic antigens to the  \nimmune system which senses them for the first time (Viana et al. 1995, Grogan et al. 1996 \na& b, Correa-Oliveira et al. 2000 ). Treatment whether by praziquantel or oxamniquine has \nmany effects on the immune system, for example, after treatment the IgE specificity to \nworm antigens increases (Dunne et al. 1991, Webster et al. 1997) and the numbers of \neosinophils was 6 fold higher than before the treatment (Kimani et al. 1991).  \n \nd) Genetic role in human resistance against Schistosoma infection  \nAbel et al. (1991) used segregation analysis on 20 Brazilian pedigrees and the results \nshowed that the intensity of S. mansoni infection was affected by a codominant major gene \nwith a frequency of 0.2-0.25 for the respective protective allele. This gene, which is called \nSM1, is located on 5q31-q33 chromosome within a cluster of genes that support a \nprotective immune response against Schistosoma by controlling many cytokines such as IL-\n4, IL5& IL-13. This region is linked to another region on the chromosome which is \ninvolved in the regulation of eosinophils and IgE (Marquet et al. 1996& 1999). A \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n19 \n \nsecondary study in a community in Senegal confirmed this Schistosoma resistance gene in \nclusters (Muller-Myhsok et al. 1997).   \n \ne) Putative immune & endemic normal  \n A small group of people in endemic areas are naturally immune to Schistosoma infection. \nAlthough they are in continuous contact with infected water and do not take any anti-\nSchistosoma chemotherapy, they are Schistosoma negative. Generally, they are older \nindividuals and their anti-Schistosoma IgE levels are higher than IgG4. The peripheral \nblood mononuclear cells of the natural resistant individuals secrete higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 \nwhen exposed to Schistosoma antigens (Correa-Oliveira et al. 1989, Viana et al. 1995). \n \n1.7 Complement  \nThe complement system provides a mechanism which is a part of the innate and adaptive \nimmune response against parasites. It includes a group of plasma proteins which are \nactivated in cascade manner. The terminal activation cascade of complement forms \nmembrane attack complexes which insert in the membranes of the intravascular parasites. \nComplement activation leads to the generation of numerous activation products which \nenhance the immune response by opsonising foreign antigens and attracting phagocytes and \nother leukocytes to the location of infection. There are three complement activation \npathways; the classical, the alternative and the lectin. The classical pathway is initiated by \nimmune complexes, the lectin one becomes activated when MBL (mannan-binding lectin) \nor ficolins bind to carbohydrates found on the surface of the organisms or parasites, \nwhereas the alternative pathway is initiated by direct contact between the activated \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n20 \n \ncomplement components and the surface of pathogens. C3 is a key component of the \ncomplement system (Bohlson et al. 2007, Walport 2001a& b).  \n \n1.7.1 Schistosoma and complement  \n a) The classical pathway  \nClassical pathway activation starts when immunoglobulins of class IgM and nearly all \nmembers of class IgG bind to the parasite. Immunoglobulins of different classes were \nidentified on outer surface of Schistosoma either by cytochemical or immunocytochemical \ntechniques in addition to Fc regions of Ig receptors (Kemp et al. 1977& 1980, Tarleton & \nKemp, 1981). The antibodies activate the initial molecule of the classical pathway, C1, \nwhich is formed of three glycoproteins; C1r, C1s and C1q as a recognition subcomponent \nwhich binds to the fixed antibodies and thereby initiate the classical pathway (Weiss et al. \n1986, Perkins et al. 1986).  \n \n \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n21 \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Complement pathways (Fujita 2002) \n \nb) The lectin pathway \nFor the lectin pathway, MBL and L-ficolin, which are plasma components, are the \nrecognition molecules that bind to the carbohydrates in particular to mannose on pathogen \nsurfaces (Schwaeble et al. 2002). The surface of cercariae and adult Schistosoma expose \ncarbohydrates which bind to host MBL as shown by electron microscopy and fluorescence \nmicroscopy. In C1q deficient serum, it was shown that MBL alone is sufficient to fix C4c \ncomplement component on the tegument. However, this pathway appears to be not \neffective in killing Schistosoma (Klabunde et al. 2000). \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n22 \n \n1.7.2 Anti-complement Schistosoma mechanisms  \nAdult stage parasites and schistosomulae have developed many mechanisms to avoid the \nlethal effect of the complement (Fishelson 1995, Capron 1992). Schistosoma gets rid of the \nhost immunoglobulin by ingestion through its gut and binding by FcR on the tegument, \nthen these Ig are processed within the excretory system of Schistosoma (Thors et al. 2006) \nand this renders the classical complement pathway unable to activate complement. \nSchistosoma may also evade complement attack by breaking down complement \ncomponents or complement convertases on its surface. The parasite may deplete these \ncomponents by binding them to the outer membranes and replace those through rapid \nmembrane turnover (Ghendler et al. 1996, Brouwers et al. 1999). \n \nSchistosoma possess many molecules which inhibit complement activation. CRIT \n(complement C2 receptor inhibiting trispannin) is firstly discovered in S. haematobium then \nS. mansoni  and  it  was detected by its specific antibodies using the electron microscope, in \nthe apical plasma membrane and surface pits of the adults. This protein acts as a receptor \nfor the C2 molecule and can hinder the formation of the C3 convertase, C4b2a (Inal 1999, \nInal& Schifferli2002, Inal& Sim 2000). In vitro studies showed that the peptides taken \nfrom the C-terminal part of this protein inhibited activation of the complement (Inal et al. \n2003). \n \nCirculating Anodic Antigen (CAA), which is released from the intact Schistosoma \nintestine, acts as a soluble receptor for C1q. It binds to the collagen\u2013like stalks of C1q in \nvitro, so, it could have a role in protecting the parasite intestine against complement \nactivation by immune complexes in vivo (Van Dam et al. 1993).  \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n23 \n \nA novel 130 kDa protein described on the surface pits and within the multilamellar vesicles \nof  Schistsosoma, was shown to be  produced by the parasites. This protein is a C3 receptor \nwhich binds and inhibits the activation of host C3 thus inactivating all the three pathways at \nthe C3 activation stage (Rasmussen& Kemp 1987, Silva et al. 1993).  \n \nAnother antigen, Schistosoma paramyosin, has multiple roles in the protection of \nSchistosoma against host complement. Paramyosin was shown to bind to C1q in vitro \n(Laclette et al. 1992) and it also binds to human complement components C8 and C9 \npreventing the insertion of the membrane attack complex (Deng et al. 2003a& b& 2007). \nSchistosoma paramyosin was originally named Schistosoma Complement Inhibitory \nProtein-1(SCIP-1) (Parizade et al. 1994). It was later shown that SCIP-1 is an isoform of \nparamyosin and is present on the surface of the parasite (Deng et al. 2003& 2007) \nParamyosin was also suggested to act as  Fc receptor (Loukas et al. 2001).  \n \n Delay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a human complement regulatory component which \nlimits the half life of C3 and C5 convertase. This molecule is captured from human plasma \nby Schistosoma protecting the parasite itself from complement attack (Pearce et al. 1990, \nHorta et al. 1991).   \n \nA 28-kDa cercarial serine protease was shown to cleave many complement components \nincluding C9, C3 and iC3b (Fishelson et al. 1992,  Parizade et al. 1994). Another antigen of \n56 kDa was found on the Schistosoma surface which has serine protease inhibitor activity \nand interfere with the elastase released from neutrophil (Ghendler et al. 1994). \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n24 \n \n1.8  Diagnosis of schistosomiasis \nThe diagnosis of schistosomiasis depends on historical evidence of contact with infected \nwater, the clinical picture and laboratory investigations. Passing of blood in urine, \nhaematuria, especially in school children in endemic areas could point to schistosomiasis \ncaused by S. haematobium. However, S. mansoni has more non-specific symptoms and \nsigns such as bloody diarrhoea which could be a symptom for many other diseases (Savioli \net al. 1990).  The diagnosis is assisted by laboratory tests and radiological investigations. \n \n1.8.1 Parasitological methods \nSchistosoma eggs can be identified by microscopy in stool, urine or other tissues through  \ntheir characteristic  shapes. This method is widely used and considered to be the most \nspecific method to diagnosis the infection (Hamilton et al. 1998, Doenhoff et al. 2004). The \ndetection of parasite egg by microscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of \nschistosomiasis (Goncalves et al. 2006). There are many techniques used for the \npreparation of stool or urine specimens to be examined by microscopy for example, the  \nformol-ether concentration method (Blagg et al. 1955, Knight et al. 1976) or the Kato-Katz \nsmear (Katz et al. 1972) are used for stool specimens, whereas  sedimentation and filtration \ntechniques are used for urine samples (Dazo& Biles 1974). \n \nKato and Miura (1954) described a thick-smear method for stool examination to detect eggs \nof different helminths including S. mansoni and S. japonicium. The stool smear is covered \nwith a cellophane strip soaked in glycerol\/malachite solution. Katz et al. (1972) developed \na card with hole in its centre with known dimensions accommodating 50 mg stool and then \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n25 \n \n the method known as Kato-Katz. Kato-Katz thick smear is mostly recommended for \ndiagnosis of intestinal Schistosoma in endemic areas for both national control programmes \nand epidemiological purposes (WHO 1994, Bowie et al. 2004). This technique is \nquantitative, easily used, of high specificity, rapid and performed at low cost.  It requires \nsimple equipments and the persons doing this test can be easily trained (de Vlas&  Gryseels \n1992, Engels et al. 1996, Ebrahim et al. 1997). However, a single Kato-Katz smear has low \nsensitivity and may miss cases excreting fewer than 100 epg (egg per gram of stool), hence \nmay overestimate the cure rate (Barreto et al. 1990, Engels et al. 1996, Teesdale et al. \n1985,  Ebrahim et al. 1997,  Eberl et al. 2002 ).  \n \nFew eggs in a stool sample may limit the sensitivity of the Kato-Katz test and can be \ncaused by the presence of immature worms that are not yet  secreting eggs (Cheever 1968), \nor by the fact that, the eggs may not be distributed evenly in the stool (Ye et al. 1998). \nThere can also be day to day variations in eggs depositions (Engels et al. 1996, van Etten et \nal. 1997,   Kongs et al. 2001). Likewise, severe intestinal fibrosis developed with chronic \ninfection could also hinder eggs secretion (Cheever 1968). \n  \nTo increase its sensitivity, multiple Kato-Katz smears from the same stool sample or from \nsubsequent stool specimens need to be examined (Rabello, 1997, Engels et al. 1997, \nGryseels & de Vlas 1996, Kongs  et al. 2001), however, frequent sampling requires further \nvisits to the clinic, many patients could be of low compliance and sampling  two-\nconsecutive-day samples involves higher  cost (Berhe et al. 2004). Many attempts were \nmade to replace the Kato-Katz test, for example the digestion-sedimentation technique \n(Borel et al. 1999), using negrosin-eosin stain instead of malachite green (Sayed et al. \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n26 \n \n2002), but nearly all of these methods yielded either similar or even lower sensitivity than \nthe routine Kato-Katz test.   \n \nRectal biopsy could be examined microscopically to look for Schistosoma eggs, however, it   \nrequires a specialised medical doctor to perform this biopsy as this is an invasive \nprocedure, while a two to five stool sampling examination can result in nearly the same \nlevel of accuracy as rectal biopsies (Abdel-Hafez& Balbol 1992, Rabello et al. 1992 b).  \n \nThe hatching test is another less popular microscopic test which is designed to see the \nmiracidia coming from the parasite eggs (Fulleborn 1921, Chieffi et al. 1978). However, \nthis test produces unsatisfactory sensitivity and is not suitable for field studies (Ross et al. \n2001, Yu et al. 2007).  \n \n 1.8. 2 Immuno-diagnostic methods  \nAfter more than 40 years of using Kato-Katz, it has been realized that the field of diagnosis \nof Schistosoma still needs more sensitive techniques (Bergquist 2008). Serology based tests \nmay be complementary for the routine parasitological methods or even substitute them \n(Doenhoff et al. 2004, Xiang et al. 2003).  \n \n1.8.1.2.1 Direct methods to detect specific Schistosoma circulating antigens  \nDirect detection of specific antigens shedding from different Schistosoma stages as markers \nof infection have considerable advantages; they indicate ongoing active infection (van  \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n27 \n \nLieshout et al. 1994, de Clercq et al. 1997) and some circulating antigens may also be \ndetected in urine samples (van Etten et al. 1996). Some of these antigens may be valuable \ninformation for follow-up patients having treatment (de Clerq et al. 1997). However, these \ntechniques may also have disadvantages, for example low sensitivity in cases harbouring \nlow Schistosoma infection (De Jonge et al. 1991). The detection of some antigens show \noften similar sensitivity to that observed in the parasitological examination (Van Lieshout \net al. 1995), the monoclonal detecting antibodies are of high costs, the procedure may be \ntime consuming and require expensive equipment (Krijger et al. 1994, Rabello 1997). In \ngeneral, all specimens should be pre-treated with trichloroacetic acid or heat-incubation in \nan alkaline buffer with pH 9.6 (Krijger et al. 1994).  \n \na) Adult derived antigens  \nThe most widely studied Schistosoma antigens as markers for parasite sero-diagnosis are \ncirculating anodic antigen (CAA) and circulating cathodic antigen (CCA). Both of them are \ngut-associated proteoglycans and CAA migrates to the anode during electrophoresis, while \nCCA migrates towards the cathode (Nash et al. 1974, Nash& Deelder 1985). The antigens \nare shed from adult parasites into the host blood (Deelder et al. 1994). Both CAA and CCA \ncan be detected in serum and urine, but in urine CCA concentration is higher than CAA (De \nJonge et al. 1989, Krijger et al. 1994). \n \nCCA molecule contains repeating units of Lewis\u2013X trisaccharide epitopes which might \ncross-react with antigens released by other pathogens sharing these epitopes and thus may \nproduce false positive results (Van Dam et al. 1994). In contrast, CAA has unique \nrepetitive carbohydrate units which explains why this parasite antigen give a higher \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n28 \n \nspecificity (Bergwerff et al.1994). The serum CAA level was found to correlate with worm \nburden in many infected subjects (Deelder et al. 1994, Agnew et al. 1995,  van Lieshout et \nal. 1995), but this may not always be true  (Polman et al. 2000). \n \nMonoclonal antibodies specific for CAA and CCA are used to capture them in different \nassays such as sandwich ELISA, indirect haemagglutination, time-resolved \nimmunofluorometric assay, magnetic bead immunoassay and reagents strips (Deelder et al. \n1989a& b, De Jonge et al. 1989, Gunderson et al. 1992, Van Etten et al. 1994, Van Dam  et \nal. 2004,  Stothard et al. 2009). \n \nb) Larva derived antigens \nA circulating polypeptide cercarial antigen of 41 kDa can be detected 3 days after \nSchistosoma infection in experimental mice by a competitive inhibition ELISA using the \nrabbit antiserum developed against this cercarial antigen. This antigen was prepared by \nhydrophobic chromatography from cercarial preparation. In a human study, this assay \nachieved specificity of 85% and 100% sensitivity (Hayunga et al. 1986& 1987).  \n \nc) Egg derived antigens \nCirculating egg antigens were detected in the case of S. haematobium in urine by Kahama \net al. (1998a& b). When using a sandwich ELISA to determine the excreted circulating egg \nantigens in urine after chemotherapy, it was found that  the level of these antigens decrease \n,but at a slower rate in comparison to CCA (Nibbeling et al. 1998a& b,  Nourel Din et al. \n1994a& b). In elderly patients, their excretion in the urine is significantly lower in \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n29 \n \ncomparison to the egg output and circulating soluble egg antigen levels in serum (Nourel \nDin et al. 1994a). \n \nRecently, S. mansoni eggs were found to secrete unique unconjugated oligosaccharides, \nglycoproteins and glycolipid antigens. It was suggested that mass spectrometric detection \nof the specific oligosaccharides in urine could be useful in the diagnosis of schistosomiasis \n(Robijn et al. 2007a& b& 2008). \n \n1.8.2.2 Indirect methods for detection of specific Schistosoma antibodies  \nThese methods depend on the detection of specific antibodies against certain parasite \nantigens. Many assays are described for detection of the Schistosoma specific antibodies \nsuch as dot blot assay (Boctor et al. 1987), Dot-dye-immunoassay (Rabello et al. 1992a), \nFAST (Falcon Assay Screening Test)-ELISA (Hancock& Tsang 1986) and TSP \n(Transferable Solid Phase)-ELISA (Moser et al. 1990). The criteria which give superiority \nof one antigen over others are indicated by the criteria of sensitivity and specificity, in \naddition to the cost implications of the procedures used (Hamilton et al. 1998). \n \nNowadays, the most widely used system for the detection of the specific antibodies is the \nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was introduced by Engvall and \nPerlmann (1971). Voller et al. (1974& 1976) first described an ELISA technique which is \nperformed in microtitre plates. Since then it has become the most widely used assay for S. \nmansoni sero-diagnosis. ELISA is easy, reproducible and can accommodate large numbers \nof samples (Haimlton et al. 1998,  Doenhoff et al. 2004). \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n30 \n \na) Adult derived antigens  \nMaterials prepared from adult Schistosoma can be obtained easily and in large amounts \nwhen compared with other parasite stages (Hamilton et al. 1998, Doenhoff et al. 2004). \nCrude adult antigens were applied intra-dermally, or used for ELISA and for blotting \nassays. The intra-dermal test is of low sensitivity in the children and women and give a \nhigh rate of false negative reading (de Noya et al. 1992). ELISA coated with soluble worm \nantigen preparations (SWAP) allows differentiating between acute and chronic patients \n(Valli et al. 1997).  \n \nWestern blot analyses using crude adult S. mansoni antigens achieved higher specificity \nand sensitivity in comparison to indirect haemagglutination test (IHA) and immune-\nfluorescence antibody test (IFAT). With blotting, six proteins within the range of  65-120 \nkDa in size, were shown to be  specific for Schistosoma infection and  these proteins show \nno cross-reaction with other parasitic diseases (Sulahian et al. 2005). Immuno-blotting of \nsome n-Butanol extracted antigens from the adult S. mansoni membrane is of high \nsensitivity and specificity (Cesari et al. 2005). \n \nDetection of antibodies of the IgM class against S. mansoni gut polysaccharide antigens on \nwhole adult parasite sections fixed with paraffin and analysed by immuno-fluorescence \nmicroscopy, was used for diagnosis of schistosomiasis. This method is valuable in a low \ntransmission area (Hoshino-Shimizu et al. 1992, van Lieshout et al. 2000). However, \npersons who are exposed to Schistosoma infection for long periods of times have low IgM \nlevels against S. mansoni gut polysaccharides antigens, so IFAT-IgM is not suitable in \nendemic areas (Sorgho et al. 2005). In addition, IFAT-IgM detection is expensive, as it \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n31 \n \nrequires expensive fluorescent microscope and this method is not suitable for examining a \nlarge number of samples (van Lieshout et al. 2000, Oliveira et al. 2005).  \n \nAdult worm\u2019s vomitus samples were tested by ELISA to diagnosis S. mansoni infection in \nendemic areas in Africa. This method allows identifying as much as 94.6% of the infected \nindividuals (Bahgat et al. 2006). \n \nAnother parasite antigen termed adult microsomal antigens (MAMA) was characterized by \nTsang et al. (1983). When using MAMA as an antigen for FAST- ELISA detection of anti-\nparasite antibody, nearly 100% specificity and sensitivity were seen in the immuno-\ndiagnosis of S. mansoni (Hancock& Tsang 1986). The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) \n(USA) uses MAMA for the initial screening of schistosomiasis in a FAST-ELISA \nprocedure to analysis sera of travellers returning from the endemic areas. A subsequent \nspecies-specific confirmation is achieved using the same antigen in an immuno-blotting \nassay (Tsang& Wilkins 1997). \n \nCathepsin B, a 31 kDa antigen (Gotz& Klinkert 1993) and asparaginyl endoproteinase, a 32 \nkDa antigen (Dalton et al. 1995) are cysteine proteinases which are proteolytic \nimmunogenic enzymes belonging to the excretory\/secretory products of the S. mansoni \ndigestive tract. Their specific antibodies appear in sera 4 weeks after the commencement of \ninfection (Ruppel et al. 1991& 1987). Approximately 82-88.6% of serum samples of \npatients recognized these recombinant enzymes in a study carried out in Africa  (Klinkert et \nal.1991).  \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n32 \n \nSpecific antibodies against recombinant S. mansoni Hsp70 were found in patients suffering  \nfrom chronic infections.  They were, however, not detected at the acute stage of infection \n(Moser et al. 1990).  \n \nRP26 is a parasitic protein of 26 kDa which was recombinantly expressed using adult S. \nmansoni cDNA library as a template to generate the ORF encoding this protein. The \namplified sequence showed 99% identity to the cDNA sequence of the previously \ndescribed Sm22 antigen. RP26 is useful for the diagnosis of acute infections as 89% of \npatients with acute S. mansoni infections were identified by ELISA. However, only 26% \nchronic patients were positive. In experimental mouse models of infection, it was shown \nthat these antibodies are detectable up the time point 9 weeks post-infection then \ndiminished (Makarova et al. 2003). \n \nb) Larva derived antigens  \nThe Cercarien Hullen Reaction (the formation of a membrane around the cercariae when \nexposed to infected Schistosoma serum) was used for the diagnosis of specific anti-\ncercariae antibodies (Vogel& Minning 1948). Its efficacy is better than that of IHA and of \nstool examination, but it is still second to the efficacy of rectal biopsy analysis (Ahmed et \nal. 1993). \n \nThere are many individual cercarial antigens which were evaluated for Schistosoma \ndiagnosis including, cercarial elastase antigen which showed 87.2% sensitivity (Ramzy et \nal. 1997).                      \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n33 \n \nc) Eggs derived antigens  \nCircumoval precipitin is a very old test developed by Oliver-Gonzales (1954) which was \nused for the detection of specific antibodies towards S. mansoni and S. haematobium eggs.  \nThis test allows differentiating between active infection and past infection, but it is not \nsuitable for the epidemiological screening as it is very expensive and requires the \npreparation of live eggs (Spencer et al. 1991, Alarcon de Noya et al. 1997). \n \nSoluble egg antigens (SEA) are more sensitive and specific than their counterpart adult \nparasite extracts (Lunde et al. 1979& 1980, Mott et al. 1987, Khalil et al. 1989, Tanabe et \nal. 1990).  ELISA-SEA of S. mansoni is used in the routine diagnosis of schistosomiasis  in \nparasitology laboratories in U.K  for  travellers returning from endemic zones (Whitty et al. \n2000,  Van Gool et al. 2002). It has been used as a front line diagnostic method for the \ndetection of infected persons in low transmission areas such as Brazil and Venezuela (de \nNoy et al. 1992).  \n \nIn a comparison between different antigen preparations in endemic areas in Africa, the \nSEA-ELISA was superior to the SWAP-ELISA in the group of egg passing infected \nindividuals (Sorgho et al. 2005). The detection of specific IgA against egg antigens allowed \ndiscrimination between acute and chronic Schistosoma infection (Liping et al. 1996). IgG \nimmunoglobulin specific to SEA were detected not only in human serum, but also in the \nsaliva with nearly the same sensitivity and specificity in the serum when both were tested \nby ELISA (Garcia et al. 1995, Santos et al. 2000). \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n34 \n \nDuring Schistosoma infection, anti-egg antibodies develop against only a limited number of \nglycan egg antigens (Doenhoff et al. 2004).  From the six fractions of S. mansoni egg \nhomogenates obtained by cationic exchange chromatography, cationic fraction (CEF6) \nshowed the highest specificity and sensitivity (McLaren et al. 1981, Turner et al. 2004, \nDoenhoff et al. 1985, Dunne et al. 1988). CEF6 was used in sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \nin an endemic area in Saudia Arabia with 90% sensitivity and 50% specificity (Ghandour et \nal. 1997).  \n \nIt is interesting to note that for Schistosoma diagnosis, people have successfully used also a \nnon-derived parasite antigen like keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). KLH (derived from \nMegathura crenulata, marine mollusc) has similar carbohydrate epitopes to those found on \nthe surface of S. mansoni schistosomulae (Grzych et al. 1987). There is a stringent cross- \nreactivity between immunogenic elements of KLH and the three major immunogenic egg \nantigens; omega-1, alpha-1 and kappa-1 (Hamilton et al. 1999). Specific IgG and IgM \nlevels are high in acute infection and then decrease, when the infection becomes chronic \n(Alves-Brito et al. 1992, Markl et al. 1991, Xue et al. 1993). KLH, however, does not \nallow to differentiate between the acute and chronic infection in non-endemic patients and \nits  sensitivity is relatively low (Verweij et al. 1995). \n \n1.8. 3 Detection of Schistosoma DNA materials  \nHamburger et al. (1991) described a highly repetitive 121 bp sequence of S. mansoni DNA \nwhich represents around 10% of the parasite genome. PCR amplification of this fragment \nwas used in humans with high sensitivity and specificity in comparison to three Kato-Katz \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n35 \n \nsamples (Rabello et al. 2002). It was amplified from mouse sera 2 weeks after Schistosoma \ninfection without the requirement for special preparation of the serum (Suzuki et al. 2006). \n \nMultiplex real time PCR has detected the genome of both S. mansoni and S. haematobium \nin human faecal samples by amplifying the species-specific cytochrome C oxidase enzyme \ngene (ten Hove et al. 2008). Detection of parasite DNA is a promising diagnostic tool \nbecause of its high sensitivity and specificity, however, it is still expensive and needs \ncomplicated laboratory equipment (Abath et al. 2006, Sandoval  et al. 2006).  \n \n1.9 Vaccine against Schistisoma  \nProduction of vaccine against Schistosoma is an important line which could to be included \nin future Schistosoma control programs. Praziquantel, the main anti-Schistosoma \nchemotherapy, has several drawbacks; it is only effective against the adult parasite \n(Doenhoff et al. 1987) and here is also concern about the development of drug resistance \n(Picquet et al. 1998, Ismail et al. 1999, Kusel& Hagan 1999), PZ treatment needs to be \nrepeated several times (Doenhoff et al. 2000) and it does not affect the transmission rate \n(Bergquist et al. 2002). \n \n1.9.1 Expected role of vaccine in disease control  \nA complete protection against schistosomiasis through vaccination is presently not \nachievable. The parasite does not multiply within the human host and therefore a vaccine \nwhich even  leads to a  considerable reduction  in  the numbers of adults and\/  or eggs   can  \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n36 \n \nmake a significant difference in the severity of the disease (Bergquist 1995, Wilson&  \nCoulson 2006). \n \n1.9.2 Types of the vaccines according to their effects  \nVaccines can be categorized according to their mode of action. Vaccines which are \ndesigned to prevent infection, vaccines causing  female parasite to decrease egg production, \nanti-fecundity vaccines, and ones which combat the pathology induced by the deposited \neggs, anti-pathology vaccine (Bergquist et al. 2002) \n \n1.9.3 Ideal immune mechanism of anti-Schistosoma vaccine \nThere is no general agreement amongst parasitologists about the nature of the most \neffective immune response. It could be cellular (Th1), humoral (Th2) or both but the latter   \nwill be very difficult to generate as it requires an optimal synergism between both arms of \nimmune response. An immune response that causes parasite protection against different \nantigens in experimental animals, might not be as effective in humans (Bergquist et al. \n2002).   \n \na) Role of Th1 immune response in the protection against Schistosoma  \nVaccines, that induce a Th1type response protect the host from switching the immune \nresponse towards Th2, hence avoiding the occurrence of severe morbidity and act as anti-\npathology vaccines (Wynn et al. 1994), but this might also lead to early liver disease \n(Stadecker 1999). In mice, protection against Schistosoma challenge occurs under the \ncontrol of cytokines produced by Th1 cells (Smythies et al. 1993). Elimination of the \ninvading cercariae could occur in the lung by the activated macrophages which may be \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n37 \n \ncontrolled by IFN-\u03b3 (Wilson& Coulson 1998 & Coulson 1997). The pulmonary \nmacrophages generate inducible nitric oxide synthase which mediate nitric oxide (NO) \nproduction from L-arginine  and  NO is proved to kill recently transformed schistosomulum \nin vitro (Wynn et al. 1994, Street et al. 1999) and mouse which is deficient in iNOS shows  \nlower levels of protection than  the wild type (James et al. 1998).  \n  \nIn the irradiated attenuated vaccine model, protection is mediated by Th1 through the \nformation of foci which surround the migrating larva in lung vessels hindering their \nmigration and forcing them to pass into lung alveoli to die there. These aggregates are \ncomposed of CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and macrophages and their formation depends \nupon IFN-\u03b3 (Kambara& Wilson 1990). \n \nIndividuals who did not have anti-Schistosoma treatment and are resistant to the infection \nshow Th1 immune response against schitosomulum antigens (Correa-Oliveira et al. 2000). \nThe protection against some parasites such as some helminths and many intracellular \nprotozoa such as Toxoplasma, Trypanosoma and Leishmania is associated with Th1 \ndependent cytokines responses (Finkelman et al. 1991).   \n \nb) Role of Th2 immune response in the protection against Schistosoma  \nOn the other hand, there are some reports which support Th2 dependent vaccines.  In \nrodents, the protection against Schistosoma correlates with predominant Th2 immune \nresponse profile (Grzych et al. 1991). In humans, the resistance is associated with IgE \n(Webster et al. 1996, Capron and Capron, 1994, Hagan et al. 1991). Partial protection in \nhumans is achieved after repeated chemotherapy and is associated with a Th2 type response \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n38 \n \n(Walter et al. 2006). In some parasites, the protection is associated with specific IgE such \nas Necator americanus where patients with a high IgE levels have a lower load of N. \namiricanus infection in comparison to others with lower IgE levels (Pritchard et al. 1999).  \n \n1.9.4 Difficulties in the path of anti-Schistosoma vaccine development \na) Immune evasion strategies of Schistosoma \nSchistosoma, in its all developmental stages, use various mechanisms to establish itself in \nthe body, avoiding the immune system (Doenhoff 1997, Davies 1983). The penetrating \nschistosomulum stays in the skin until it develops strategies to evade the effective immune \nresponse (Crabtree& Wilson 1985).  It hinders migration of effector Langerhans cells in the \nskin by induction of prostaglandin D2 formation (Angeli et al. 2001). Secreted proteinases \nsuch as Sm31, Sm32 and cercarial elastases are involved in the modulation of the immune \nresponse against Schistosoma (Brindley et al. 1997). The removed glycocalyx membrane of \nthe penetrating cercaria is an alternative complement pathway activator consuming this \ncomplement pathway in the microenvironment around the parasite (Marikovsky et al. \n1986& Caulfield et al. 1991). The phospholipids of the adult tegument undergo de-\nacylation and re-acylation using fatty acids from the host (Brouwers et al. 1997). Different \nstages of Schistosoma adsorb many host molecules such as blood groups antigens and \nmajor histocompatibility products on their surfaces to mimic the host tissues (Sher et al. \n1978, Goldring et al. 1976).  \n \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n39 \n \nThe \u201cHappy Valley Hypothesis\u201d, suggested by Wilson et al. (1999), speculates that \nSchistosoma has evaded the host immune response by eliciting a mixed Th1 and Th2 \ncytokines response avoiding polarization to either of them which will be in turn  lethal  to \nthe parasite.  \n \nb) Financial shortage \nFunding shortage for vaccine research has slowed vaccine progress. The last international \nprogramme targeted towards development of anti-Schistosoma is Vaccine Development \nProgramme (SVDP) which closed in 2002 (Bergquist et al. 2005, Loukas et al. 2007).  \n \n1.9.5 Anti-Schistosoma mansoni vaccine candidates \na)  Antigens which are suggested by World Health Organization (WHO) \nWHO had selected six antigens that have been derived from S. mansoni and supported \nindependent testing of these antigens in different laboratories, but none of them achieved \nmore than 40% protection in the tested animals (Bergquist 1995, Bergquist& Colley 1998,  \nBergquist et al. 2005).   \n \nGlutathione S-transferase (Sm28-GST) \nBalloul and his colleagues purified glutathione S-transferase in 1987. Some co-workers did \nnot detect this antigen on the surface of the tegument (Holy et al. 1989) while Taylor et al. \n(1988) found it on the tegument. By using mass spectrometry, it was identified in the \ncytosolic fractions of the tegument but not on outer surface of Schistosoma (Braschi et al. \n2006). Schistosoma Sm28-GST has many vital functions for different stages of the parasite, \nit inhibits migration of the dermal Langerhans cells by formation of prostaglandin D2, thus \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n40 \n \nprotecting schistosomulum from being attacked by dendritic cells (Angeli et al. 2001,  \nHerve et al. 2003) and it has a role in the productivity functions of the adults by synthesis \nof prostaglandin D2 (Capron et al. 2005). \n \nIn vaccine trials, Sm28-GST achieved 40-72% protection in mice and rats exposed to \nexperimental Schistosoma infection (Balloul et al. 1987). Specific monoclonal antibodies \nwhich prevent Sm28-GST enzyme functions caused a significant reduction in the numbers \nof adult parasite and decreased the viability and numbers of the eggs, whereas the \nmonoclonal antibodies which do not affect its enzymatic function reduced worms numbers \nonly (Xu et al. 1993, Capron et al. 1995, Grzych et al. 1993). Anti-Sm28- GST IgG and \nIgA antibodies correlate with human resistant to re-infection (Lebens et al. 2004). The \nimmune response induced by experimental Sm28 is affected mainly by the type of \nadjuvants used; with alum or complete Freund\u2019s, Th2 cytokine profile predominant but \nwhen Sm28 is-GST expressed in recombinant Salmonella typhimurium, the response is of \nTh1 profile. Dose of the protein, route of administration and genetic background of the \nanimal might essentially determine the resultant immune response (Comoy et al. 1998).  \n \nParamyosin  \nParamyosin was identified by using antibodies generated during immunisation of mice with \nS. mansoni extracts of 97 kDa (Lanar et al. 1986).  It is a myofibrillar protein forming the \nmain bulk of muscles in invertebrates. It has not been detected on the tegument surface \neither by immunohistological methods or by Western blotting analysis (Schmidt et al. \n1996).  Schistosoma paramyosin has many functions including the binding of C1q and the \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n41 \n \nFc portions of the immunoglobulins, hence it has a role in the immune evasion of \nSchistosoma (Loukas et al. 2001). \n \nNative and recombinant S. mansoni  paramyosin preparations have been tested as potential \nvaccines against Schistosoma  infection and were shown to  achieve protection in the region \nof up to 30%. Paramyosin stimulates T lymphocytes of vaccinated mice to produce \ncytokines including IFN-\u03b3 which activate macrophages to kill schistosomula, whereas \npassive immunisation of na\u00efve mice with Sm97 specific antibodies failed to be protective \nagainst the infection (Pearce et al. 1988). The sera of naturally resistant humans contained \nSm 97antibodies (Correa-Oliveira et al. 1989) and the immune response showed a typical \nTh1 cytokine response profile correlating with resistance (Al-Sherbiny et al. 2003).  \n \nIr-V5 \nThe sera of mice immunised with irradiated cercariae showed antibodies against a 200 kDa \nmyosin protein. Ir-V5 is found on the surface of newly transformed schistosomula.  cDNA \nencoding a myosin sub-fragment of  62 kDa was cloned and used for immunisation \nexperiments. The recombinant protein achieved a protection of 75% in mice and 97.4% in \nrats. This protection was not enhanced with adjuvants. The protection action of this antigen \nappears to be mainly caused by an effective humoral response with a  highly specific \nantibody titre (Soisson et al. 1992 & 1993). \n \nTriose phosphate isomerise (TPI) \nTPI was discovered by Harn et al. (1985) using a monoclonal antibody termed mAb M.1. \nTPI is detected at different stages of the parasite life cycle mainly in the tegument as well \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n42 \n \nas in other Schistosoma tissues. Native TPI of adult parasites works enzymatically like its \nmammalian counterpart forming part of the glycolytic pathway as a catalyser for \nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate production. Schistosoma TPI has 79-87% homology to the \nmammalian TPI (Reynolds et al. 1992).  \n \nMonoclonal antibodies against TPI were shown to give partial protection (41- 49%) in mice \nchallenged with cercariae (Reynolds et al. 1992). Multiple antigen peptides (MAP), were \ndesigned for TPI immunisation, which carry B and T cell epitopes and avoid the highly \nconserved areas with a high degree of similarity to human TPI. Both of MAP and the full \nlength TPI are highly immunogenic and are strong stimulants for Th1 to produce IL-2 and \nIFN-\u03b3 (Reynolds et al. 1994). In 1997, Ferru and his colleagues made a construct using \nMAP of TPI bearing T and B cell epitopes and 115-131 peptides from Schistosoma GST  \nachieving T cell responses against TPI and B cell responses against GST.  Peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated in vitro assay using MAP4 (which is a multiple \nantigen peptide containing B and T cell epitopes of TPI) produced a typical Th1 cytokine \nresponse with a predominant release of IFN-\u03b3 (Reis et al. 2008).  \n \nSm23  \nSm23 was identified using monoclonal antibodies directed against the schistosomulum of \nS. mansoni (Harn et al. 1985). Subsequently, the gene was characterized. At all stages, \nSchistosoma expresses Sm23 (Harn et al. 1985, Oligino et al. 1988).  It is the only listed \nSchistosoma antigen on the WHO list that is exposed on the surface of all  Schistosoma life \ncycle stages (Harn et al. 1985,  Braschi & Wilson, 2006). It is a member of the tetraspanin \nproteins family and the two external domains of Sm23 were found to bear several B cell \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n43 \n \nspecific epitopes and at least four T cell specific domains (Reynolds et al. 1992). Sera of \ninfected humans react with recombinant Sm23, especially the C-terminal part of Sm23 \n(Gaugitsch et al. 1991, Koster et al. 1993).  \n \nIn experimental studies using Sm23 DNA as a vaccine, it conferred 21- 44% protection in \nC57BL\/6 mice infected with cercariae, showing an induction of specific IgG2a and IgG1 \nantibodies, while co-administration of plasmids expressing IL-12 or IL- 4 did not further \nreduce the worm infectivity and parasitic survival or achieve a significant increase of the \nantibody response. The protective effect appears to be dependent on the Th1 immune \nresponse. The recombinant protein failed to induce protection due to polarizations of the \nimmune response towards a Th2 response with only undetectable IgG2a levels (Da`dara et \nal. 2001, 2002& 2003).   \n \nSm14 \nSm14 is a fatty acid binding protein which was first discovered by screening of an S. \nmansoni adult worm cDNA expression library using sera of mice immunised with worm \nextract suspended in saline (Moser et al. 1991). It is found in the dorsal tubercles of adult \nmale (Moser et al. 1991), in the basal lamella of the gut and underneath the tegument (Brito \net al. 2002). Sm14 is implicated in the uptake and transport of host fatty acids through the \nparasite cytoplasm and the synthesis of the Schistosoma membrane (Moser et al. 1991). \nEndemic individuals in Brazil who are resistant to Schistosoma infection showed a strong \nTh1 immune response against recombinant Sm14 responding with a high proliferation rate \nof their PBMC and a significant release of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF following Sm14 exposure (Brito \net al. 2000).      \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n44 \n \nThere are many isoforms of Sm14. Of those, the isoform containing a methionine in amino \nacid position 20 (Sm14-M20) is the most stable and has a significantly higher fatty acids \nbinding capacity than other isoforms. Outbred Swiss mice vaccinated with Sm14-M20 were \n67% protected when challenged with Schistosoma cercariae (Ramose et al. 2003). \nImmunisation with the protein alone or as a recombinant fusion protein with tetanus toxin \nfragment C (TTFC) achieved protection against a cercariae challenge with little differences \nbetween the fusion protein and Sm14 alone. The immune response was of a typical Th2 \nphenotype in this experiment which could be elicited by using Alum as adjuvant (Abreu et \nal. 2004). DNA Sm14 immunisation induced 40.5% reduction of the adult worm which \ncorrelated with specific anti-Sm14 IgG antibody and predominance of Th1 type of immune \nresponse with high levels of IFN-\u03b3 (Fonseca et al. 2006).  \n \nb) Other promising vaccine antigens   \nTetraspanins (Tran et al. 2006), Sm29 (Cardoso et al. 2006& 2008) and glyceraldehyde 3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase (El Ridi et al. 2001a&  b). \n \n1.10  Calreticulin  \nCalreticulin (CRT) was discovered in 1974, in the rabbit endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  \noriginally as a calcium binding protein of 55 kDa weight (Ostwald& MacLennan 1974)  \nand its cDNA sequence was established (Fliegel et al. 1989, Smith& Koch 1989). \nCalreticulin has been identified in every living organism: human, plants, parasites and \ninsects except fungi (Nash et al. 1994,  Michalak et al. 2009). \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n45 \n \n1.10.1 Calreticulin structure  \nMost of our knowledge about the structure and function of calreticulin derived from studies \non human calreticulin. From the deducted amino acid sequences of calreticulin (Fliegel et \nal. 1989, Smith& Koch 1989), calreticulin is composed of three main domains, called the \nN-, P- and C-domain. In addition to, another domain called S-domain has recently been \nidentified  (Stuard et al.1996& 1997). The amino acid sequence of calreticulin starts with a \nN-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide (the first 15 amino acids) which directs the protein \ntowards ER and ends with a signature of ER retrieval sequence motif KDEL (Fliegel et al. \n1989& Michalak et al. 2009). N- and P-domains are conserved among different calreticulin \nisolated from different organisms which indicate to the importance of these domains in the \nfundamental physiological functions of calreticulin (Nakhasi et al. 1998& Michalak et al. \n1999). \n \nN-domain    \nResidues 1-180 of mature calreticulin form the N-domain which is predicted to be  globular \nin shape, based on the sequnce similarity to calnexin. It consists of 8 anti-parallel \u00df-strands. \nIts net charge is neutral. There are two highly conserved sequences motifs found \nthroughout the calreticulin family, which are residues 77-96 and 113-121. However, their \nfunctions are still unknown (Michalak et al. 2002). The N-domain contains three cysteine \nresidues, which are conserved among all variants of calretculin, two of them form a \ndisulphide bridge which may be responsible for the folding of this domain (Michalak et al. \n1992, Matsuoka et al. 1994). \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n46 \n \nThe N-domain is the site of interaction with alpha-integrins, RNA of rubella virus (host \nprotein for viral replication), DNA-binding domain of glucocorticoid receptor, auto-\nantibodies and some metals (Rojiani et al. 1991, Singh et al. 1994, Michalak et al. 1999, \nBurns et al. 1994, Eggleton et al. 2000). Protein chaperones which are found in the ER \nsuch as endoplasmic reticulum protein 57(ERP57) and protein disulfide isomerase (Baksh \net al. 1995, Corbett et al. 1999) bind with calreticulin through the N-domain.  \n \nP-domain \nThe P-domain, a highly charged domain rich in proline, spans amino acid positions 181 to \n290. It comprises three antiparallel  \u00df-sheets and contains two amino acid repeats which are \nfound only in calreticulin in each of the antiparallel \u00df-sheets. The A repeat includes the \nfollowing amino acids sequences: P-x-x-I-x-D-P-D-A-x-K-P-E-D-W-D-E and B repeat \nmotif is: G-x-W-x-P-P-x-I-N-P-x-Y-x. These repeats are thought to be responsible for its \nhigh affinity and low capacity binding to calcium and carbohydrates (Baksh& Michalak, \n1991, Vassilakos et al. 1998,  Ellgaard et al. 2001). This domain has a nuclear site signal, \nwhich suggests that it is involved in the transport of the glucocortecoid receptor to the \nnucleus (Holaska et al. 2001). \n \nOther chaperone functions assigned to calreticulin, include the binding of glycans of \nemerging glycoproteins in ER via the lectin\u2013like binding site (Tatu& Helenius, 1997, \nVassilakos et al. 1998). Calreticulin interacts, through its P-domain, with perforin, one of \nthe components of cytotoxic T cell granules, to protect RBCs from perforin mediated lysis \n(Fraser et al. 2000, Andrin et al. 1998). \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n47 \n \nC-domain \nThis domain is the least conserved domain of calreticulin. The C-domain starts from \nresidue 291 to the carboxyl terminal end of CRT (Michalak et al. 1992). It is highly acidic \n(negatively charged) with a high capacity but low affinity to bind calcium (Baksh& \nMichalak, 1991). There is still insufficient knowledge about the structure of C-domain \n(Gelebart et al. 2005).   \n \nThe C-domain accounts for about 50% of the Ca\n2+\n binding capacity of ER proteins \n(Nakamura et al. 2001). An endoplasmic reticulum signal is found in the terminal end of C-\ndomain. This signal is mainly KDEL (Pelham, 1989) (or HDEL in some organisms, such as \nS. mansoni) (Khalife et al. 1994). Calcium binding to the C-domain is thought to play a \nvital role in controlling the chaperone functions of calreticulin (Corbett et al. 1999). It \nbinds to the some blood clotting factors (Kuwabara et al. 1995). \n \nS-domain  \nThe S-domain of human calreticulin spans over 123 amino acids starting from residues \n160- 283 and has structural similarity to a CUB-domain, a motif found in many proteins \nthat bind to C1q, collectins and collagen (Stuart et al. 1997, Sim et al. 1998). It has two \nparts; the N-terminal part of S-domain overlaps the N-domain and the C-terminal part is \ninvolved in P-domain (Stuart et al. 1996, Stuart et al. 1997, Sim et al. 1998). This domain \nbinds to mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and inhibits the binding of the latter with the MBL \nAssociated Serine Proteases 1, 2 and 3 (MASP-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3) interfering with \nlectin pathway activation (Stuart et al. 1996& 1997). \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n48 \n \nUnder normal physiological conditions in vivo, C1q does not bind to calreticulin as the \nlatter is a component of C1 complex, but wherever there is inflammation, activated C1q \nmay bind and interact of calreticulin (Schafer et al. 2000,  Dietzschold et al. 1995). The S-\ndomain of calreticulin inhibits the classical and lectin pathway and impairs the cell \nfunctions mediated by C1q receptor at the site of inflammation only (Lynch et al. 2002).   \n \n1.10.2 Localization of calreticulin  \nThe most common site where calreticulin is found is the endoplasmic reticulum. The \ncalreticulin C-domain contains an ER retention sequence which \u2013 depending on the species \n\u2013 can either be KEDL in Leishmania (Joshi et al. 1996) and Trypanosoma (Aguillon et al. \n2000) or HDEL in  Schistosoma (Khalife et al. 1994,  Huggins et al. 1995). Calreticulin is \nalso found in other intracellular compartments such as the secretory granules of cytotoxic \nT-lymphocytes (Dupuis et al. 1993), on the cell surface (Gray et al. 1995, White et al. \n1995), within the nucleus (Opas et al. 1991), in the cytoplasm (Rojiani et al. 1991,  Holaska \net al. 2001), in the saliva of the tick (Jaworski et al. 1996) or in serum (Sueyoshi et al. \n1991). \n  \nThe presence of calreticulin outside of the ER could easily be explained as many proteins \nwhich are synthesized inside ER and accompany calreticulin through the Golgi apparatus \nand hence to other celluler comportments (Souto-Padron et al. 2004). Calreticulin can have \nvarious isoforms and is found in many sites inside or outside the cell (Coppolino& Dedhar, \n1998, Michalak et al. 2009). The ER retrieval peptides are cut by certain ER proteases, \nallowing protein movement to the Golgi apparatus and then to others sites. \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n49 \n \n1.10.3 Functions of calreticulin  \nMost of the identified calreticulin functions were studied mainly in vertebrates but not in \nlower organisms (Ferreira et al. 2004).  \n \n1.10.3.1 Functions inside ER  \na)  Ca\n2+ \nhaemostasis: \nCalcium binding and regulation is the most important calreticulin function (Michalak et al. \n2009).  Through the analysis of a CRT gene targeted mouse line which proofed to be lethal \nas the deficiency of CRT in homozygosity of the CRT disrupted allele leads to an impaired \nrelease Ca\n2+\n from the ER preventing development of the embryonic heart (Mery et al. 1996, \nBastianutto et al. 1995, Mesaeli et al. 1999). With a high level of Ca\n2+\n inside the ER, \ncalreticuin binds also to the carbohydrates (Vassilakos et al. 1998). \n \nFor parasites, the role of calreticulin in regulating calcium levels may be critical for the \nproduction of secondary messengers upon contact with the host molecules either soluble \nmolecules or receptors (Nakhasi et al. 1998). In the case of T. cruzi, the TcCRT calcium \nbinding character could add to the cardiac pathology accompanying Chagas\u2019 disease \nbecause of its vital role in the calcium hemostasis maintaining heart contractility (Ferreira \net al. 2004). Calcium per se has an important role in the regulation of many pathways \nrelated to metabolism, nuclear DNA cleavage, gene transcription and cell cycle regulation \n(Nicotera& Rossi 1994). \n  \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n50 \n \nb) Protein chaperon  \nInside the ER, there are many chaperone that interact with nascent unfolded proteins that \nprevent the exportation of the miss-folded proteins out of the ER (Bedard et al. 2005). \nFrom those, CRT and calnexin which interact with the glycoproteins through the \noligosaccharides present on the glycoprotein surfaces (Ellgaard et al. 1999, Trombetta \n2003). The glycoproteins are identified by quality-control cycle proteins such as CRT and \ncalnexin. Once the folding process is complete, the terminal glucose is removed by \nGlucosidase II and the proteins leave the ER. The mis-folded proteins are re-glucosylated \nby the UDP-glucose: glycoprotein transferase (UGGT) enzyme and remain in the cycle \nuntil attaining their proper folding (Hebert& Molinari 2007). The folding unit responsible \nfor the performance of the chaperon duties of calreticulin is formed by both the N- and P-\ndomains (Nakamura et al. 2001). \n \nFrom the prospective of parasites, calreticulin might  have a role in folding of some surface \nproteins such as gp63  of  African trypanosoma,  Leishmania surface antigens and a group \nof  GPI (glycophosphatidyl inositol) anchored proteins which are the main bulk of the \nsurface antigen determinant of the unicellular parasites (Ferguson 1994). Parasite \ncalreticulin is thought to support the correct folding of proteins after being secreted from \nthe parasites such as acid phosphatase and superoxide dismutases which aid in using \nsubstrates from the hosts for some of the parasites fundamental biological processes \n(Nakhasi et al. 1998). \n \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n51 \n \n1.10.3.2 Extraendoplasmic reticulum calreticulin functions  \nAlso outside the ER, calreticulin has many functions; \na) Apoptosis \nCells which over express calreticulin are more susceptible to apoptosis, in contrast to these \ncells with low CRT levels. The ectocalreticulin on dead cells attracts other cells involved in \nsystemic removal of dead cells such as phagocytes (Nakamura et al. 2000,  Chen et al. \n2005). MBL and C1q bind to apoptotic cells and then ligate to calreticulin expressed on the \nsurface of phagocytes, where calreticulin forms a functional complex with the endocytic \nreceptor protein CD91. On the surface of phagocytes, the CRT\/CD91 complex facilitates \nphagocytosis and triggers cellular activation through ligand binding (Gardai et al. 2003, \nHolmskov et al. 2003). \n \nb) Immunity related functions \nCell surface calreticulin associated with CD91 forms a C1q receptor complex (Sim et al. \n1998), which competes with immune complex to bind C1q (Johnson et al. 2001). There are \nmany observations showing to that calreticulin has an important role in the pathogenesis of \nsome autoimmune diseases and it acts as an auto-antigen interacting with other immune \ncomplexes (Michalak et al. 2009). It is a constituent of the ribonucleoprotein complex \nRO\/SS-A (Smith Surface Antigen), which induces autoantibodies in some autoimmune \ndisease (Franceschini& Cavazzana 2005, Cheng et al. 1996, Staikou et al. 2003). The \npeptides of calreticulin are associated with MHC class II molecules on the antigen \npresenting cells surfaces (Verreck et al. 1995). In some patients suffering from autoimmune \ndiseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and celiac disease, \nthere are frequently formed autoantibodies against CRT (Verreck et al. 1995, Eggelton et \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n52 \n \nal. 2000, Tuckova et al. 1997). Individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases often fail \nto clear immune complexes, a function largely mediated by C1q. The absence of the C1q \nmediated scavenger function predisposes for the development of the autoimmune diseases \nsuch as systemic lupus erythmatosus (Walport et al. 1998, Kovacs et al. 1998). Calreticulin \nis essential for the calcium signalling to modulate immune functions of T cells which is a \nprocess involved in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease (Porcellini et al. 2006). \n \nParasite calreticulin is considered to be responsible for inducing autoimmune pathologies \nfollowing Onchocera and Trypanosma infections. In Onchocera, parasite CRT does not \nhave an ER retrieval signal suggesting that the protein is secreted from the parasite during \ninfection and triggers the development of antibodies directed against CRT, thus, promoting \nan autoimmune response against host CRT (Rokeach et al. 1994). The degree of similarity \nin the amino acids sequences between the human and parasite calreticulin, implies that \nparasitic calreticulin  can also bind with the recognition molecules of classical and lectin \nactivation pathway of complement, hindering the activation of the complement during \ninfection and protecting these parasites from the attack by the host complement system \n(Ferreira et al. 2004).  \n \nc) Other calreticulin functions  \nCRT has a role in cell adhesion (Michalak et al. 1999, Opas et al. 1996) as well as an  \nimplicated function in the regulation of steroid gene expression (Burns et al. 1994) \n \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n53 \n \n1.10.4 Parasites\u2019 calreticulin  \nParasites with multiple life stages changing from invertebrate to vertebrate hosts, have the \nability to adapt quickly to the new environment pH, temperature and the new host immune \nsystem, and parasitic calreticulin has been suggested to be a sensor for the changes in \ndifferent parameters of the environments during the complex life cycle of the parasite and \nhelps the parasite to adapt to the host environment (Nakhasi et al. 1998). \n \nThere are some reports on parasite calreticulin. It has been isolated and sequenced in \nvarious parasites infecting human such as Onchocerca volvulus, Necator americanus, S. \nmansoni, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani  \n \nTrypanosoma cruzi \nThe most intensively studied parasite calreticulin, is that of T. cruzi (TcCRT). \nTrypanosoma calreticulin was cloned and sequenced by Aguill\u00f3n et al. (1995& 2000). It \nwas found to have a molecular weight of 45 kDa and its C-terminal end contains KEDL, \nER retention signal.  In Trypanosoma  cruzi, CRT is  secreted from the ER to the flagellum  \nand  appears on the parasite surface (Ferreira et al. 2004). By using immunoelectron \nmicroscopy, CRT was found in the ER, the Golgi apparatus, cytosomic vesicles of the \nepimastigotes, cytoplasm, chromatin of the nucleus and on the surface of the amastigote \nforms (Souto-Padron et al. 2004). CRT has a 50% homology with the human calreticulin. It \nis a dimorphic protein and is also known as Tc45 (Marcelain et al. 2000). Its \nimmunogenicity is confirmed in the animals (Aguilar et al. 2005) and human (Marcelain et \nal. 2000, Aguill\u00f3n et al. 1997).  B cells recognize native TcCRT in humans and mice \nindicating the high immunogeniciy of this protein which is exposed to the immune system \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n54 \n \neither by shedding by the living organism or after its death (Marcelain et al. 2000, Ramos \net al. 1991).  \n \nTcCRT binds to C1q, in particular to its collagenous part, inactivating the classical \ncomplement pathway in vitro and this could protect the parasite through an immuno-\nevasion strategy, hence increasing parasite infectivity (Ferreira et al. 2004, Norris 1998, \nRimoldi et al. 1989, Aguilar et al. 2005). Binding of C1q and calreticulin could be inhibited \nin vitro using anti-calreticulin F(ab`)2 antibodies and this shed light upon the role of  the \nspecific antibodies to achieve a balance between the parasite and human host (Aguilar et al. \n2005). Native or recombinant TcCRT shows antiangiogenic activity affecting \nvascularisation in vivo on the chicken embryonic chorio-allantoid membrane assay. This \ncould lead partly to an anti-neoplastic effect of this parasite molecule experimentally \n(Molina et al. 2005,  Aguilar et al. 2005). \n \nEntamoeba histolytica \nE. histolytica calreticulin was detected inside E. histolytica, which lacks ER. It is a 51 kDa \nprotein and EhCRT specific antibodies were identified in 90% of patients suffering from \ninvasive amoebiasis and decreased by 70 % after 6-12 months, in comparison to only 10% \nof cyst passers without any symptoms (Gonzalez et al. 2000& 2002). Girard-Misguich et \nal. (2008) confirmed its presence on the surfaces of the trophozoite form of the parasite. \n \n \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n55 \n \nNecator americanus \nCRT may be secreted by N. americanus whether during its feeding (Pritchard et al. 1999) \nor in the secretory pathways of N. americanus (Kasper et al. 2001). Hookworm CRT was \ntested as a vaccine to protect against N. americanus infection. It was found that, the \nrecombinant hookworm CRT without adjuvant reduced the numbers of adult worms by 43-\n49% in experimental BALB\/c mice which were exposed to the parasite larva (Winter et al. \n2005).    \n \nS. mansoni  \nS. mansoni CRT was detected when cDNA library of S. mansoni adult were screened with \nanti-serum of rabbit immunised with electroeluted proteins ranging from 60-65-kDa of \nadult S. mansoni. Its full DNA gene length was sequenced and it was expressed in pGEX-\n2T fusion system. It was detected in different organs of S. mansoni by \nimmunohistochemistry methods (Khalife et al.1993& 1994) and by recent proteomic \nstudies, it was detected in the S. mansoni tegument (Braschi et al. 2006). Native S. mansoni \nCRT was proved to be a good B-cell and T-cell immunogen (El Gengehi et al. 2000)  \n \nEchinococcus granulosus \nCRT was cloned from Echinococcus granulosus and detected in its hydate cysts (Cabezon \net al. 2008). \n \n \n \n \n    \nChapter  1                                                                                                              Introduction                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                  \n56 \n \n1.10  Aim of the work  \nMy PhD was based on the following aims: \ni) The cloning, recombinant expression and purification of S. mansoni calreticulin \n(SM-CRT) sub-fragments representing specific structural domains and \ncombinations thereof. \n \nii) Analysing the physiological functions of different SM-CRT sub-fragments in \nterms of calcium binding activity and their interaction with C1q (the recognition \nsubcomponent of the classical pathway of complement). \n \n \niii) Evaluation of the diagnostic use of different SM-CRT sub-fragments, CTF \n(cercarial transformation fluid antigen) in the sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \ninfection using an ELISA-based detection of specific antibodies in serum of \nexperimentally S. mansoni infected mice and of infected humans.  \n \niv) Assessment efficacy of the recombinant full length SM-CRT as a vaccine to \nlimit the severity of S. mansoni infection in experimental mouse model.   \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n57 \n \n \nChapter 2 \n \nMaterials& methods \n \n2.1 Materials \n \n2.1.1 Reagents  \n                                                                                                                    \nReagent                                                                 Company                      Catalogue No.                               \nAcetic acid glacial Fisher scientific A\/0400\/PB15 \nAcrylamide\/bis-Acrylamide, 30% Sigma-Aldrich A3699 \nAgar Lab M  MC002-A \nAgarose Melford MB 1200 \nAlsever`s solution  Sigma-Aldrich A3551 \nAmmonium persulfate Acros Organics  327081000 \nAmpicillin Sigma-Aldrich A9518 \nBamHI  New England Biolab R0136S \nBarbital Fisher scientific B\/0052\/50 \nBCIP\/NBT Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Sigma-Aldrich B1911 \nBL21(DE3)pLysE cells Invitrogen V351-20 \nBovin serum albumin (BSA) Sigma-Aldrich A9647-100G \n5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u00df-D-galactoside     Melford                           MB1001 \n (X-gal)    \nBromophenol Sigma-Alrich 114405 \nButanol Sigma-Alrich B7906 \nCaCl2     Sigma-Aldrich C3306 \nCalmodulin Sigma-Aldrich P1431 \nChloramphenicol Sigma-Aldrich C 0378  \nCoomassie Blue Serva 17525 \ndATPs Promega U1201 \nDeveloper solution  AGFA G153A \ndNTPs Promega U1511 \nEcoRI restriction enzyme  New England Biolab  R0101S \nEDTA Acros Organics 118432500 \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n58 \n \nEthidium bromide  Sigma-Aldrich E-8751 \nFormamide Sigma-Aldrich F7508 \nFixer solution  AGFA G153B \nFreund`s adjuvant Sigma-Aldrich F5881 \nGeneRuler \u2122 DNA Ladder Mix, 100 bp  Fermentas  SM 0331 \nGlycerol Sigma-Aldrich G8773 \nGlycine  Acros Organics 120070010 \nGuinea pig serum Harlan Laboratories S.R-0006B \nHCl Fisher scientific 11\/1100\/PB17 \nHuman recombinant CRT                                   Abcam                             ab15729   \nHuman C1q depleted serum  Calbiochem  234401 \nHuman C1q Sigma-Aldrich  C1740 \nImidazole Sigma-Aldrich  I0125 \nIndustrial methylated spirits (I.M.S) Fisher scientific               M\/4400\/17\n  \nIsopropanol Fisher scientific  AC41279 \nIsopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside              Melford                            MB1008 \n(IPTG)   \nKCl  Sigma-Aldrich  P9333 \nK-acetate Sigma-Aldrich  P5708 \nL.B.

The agarose mixture was heated in microwave \nuntil the powder completely dissolved, then left to cool in water bath at 58 \u00baC. The agarose \nsolution was poured into the gel cast tray, containing a sample comb, sealed with \nautoclavable tape and left at room temperature until solidification. The gel tray, after \nremoving tape and comb, was put into the agarose gel tank full with the running buffer (1X \nTAE).  From each  amplified PCR product sample, 5 \u00b5l was mixed with 1\u00b5l loading dye \n(5.8 ml of 1 M Tris pH 6.8,  0.83g SDS, 2.5 ml glycerol,1 mg bromophenol blue(Sigma \nAlrich,114405 ) completed to 10 ml with d H2O)  and loaded into the gel lanes. In the first \nlane, 6 \u00b5l of 100 bp GeneRuler \u2122 DNA Ladder Mix (Fermentas, SM 0331) was loaded. \nThe electrodes were connected with the cathode in the site of the DNA samples and the \nanode in the other site. The current was adjusted to 100 V constant and applied until the \nsamples reached near the end of the gel. The gel tray was moved from the tank, seen and \nphotographed under UV light using Olympus digital camera. \n \n2.2.1.1.3 Purification of PCR products  \nEach PCR product encoding individual SM-CRT sub-fragment was purified with QIAquick \nNucleotide Removal Kit (QIAGEN, 28304) to get rid of DNA contaminants which could \ninterfere with  subsequent  sub-cloning  process such as  salts, enzymes  and nucleotides, in  \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n73 \n \naddition to any remaining Phusion DNA Polymerase enzyme in the reaction which will \nbreak the terminal-A base again. \n \nQIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \nBriefly, buffer PN was added and mixed with each PCR product in ratio of 5:1. The sample \nwas loaded into QIAquick column placed into its collection tube and centrifuged for 1 \nminute at 10,000 xg using bench centrifuge (Eppendorf, centrifuge 5417C). After \ndiscarding follow-through, 750 \u00b5l buffer PE was added and the sample was centrifuged \nagain for another 1 minute. The follow-through was removed completely and the empty \ncolumn was then centrifuged at high speed of 10,000xg for 1 minute. The QIAquick \ncolumn was transferred to clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 30 \u00b5l buffer EB was \nadded into the centre of the membrane of column. The column was centrifuged at \nmaximum speed for 1 minute for the last time to elute the purified DNA. The eluted DNA \nwas analysed by running on 1.5 % agarose gel and DNA was kept at -20 \u00baC for further use.  \n \n2.2.1.1.4 Adding terminal-A to the blunt ended purified PCR products  \n As proof reading High-Fidelity DNA polymerase enzyme resulted in blunt-ended products, \nthe following steps were used to generate A-tailed products. From each purified PCR \nproduct encoding individual SM-CRT sub-fragment sample, 5\u00b5l was placed in labelled \nsterile small microcentrifuge tube. Then, the following reagents were added into each DNA \nsample; 2 \u00b5l buffer Taq DNA Polymerase mix 10X, 1 \u00b5l of 1mM dATP (Promega, \nU1201),1\u00b5l (5 unit) Taq DNA Polymerase  (Thermo scientific, AB-1301\/A) and autoclaved \nnanopure water was added to complete the reaction volume to 20 \u00b5l.

The bacterial strain was streaked out using a sterile metallic wire loop to spread \nbacteria on the surface of L.B. agar plate which is enriched with 10 mM Mg Cl2. The plate \nwas left overnight in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C. In the next day, the plate was transferred into 4 \n\u00b0C. At the evening prior to competent cell preparation, a single colony was picked up from \nthe corresponding plate with a sterile pipette tip and inoculated into 5 ml sterile L.B.  and \nleft overnight in shaker incubator (New Brunswick Scientific (UK) Ltd, Innova 44) at 37 \n\u00b0C with 200 rpm. In the following morning, 1 ml of the overnight culture was transferred \ninto 100 ml of fresh sterile L.B. media and it put back at 37 \u00b0C with 200 rpm for 2-3 hours \nuntil the OD550 reached 0.7-0.8. After that, the cells were spun at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes \nat 4 \u00b0C (Beckman coulter, Allegra\u00ae X-22) and the supernatant was discarded. The bacterial  \npellet was re-suspended with 30 ml of sterile ice cold TfbI (30 mM K-acetate,  50 mM Mn \nCl2, 10 mM CaCl2  and 15 % Glycerol)  and placed on ice for 15 minutes for TOP10F` or \n30 minutes in case of BL21(DE3)pLysS. The mixture was then  centrifuged at 4000 rpm \nfor 10 minutes at 4 \u00b0C and the bacterial pellet was re-suspended gently with 4 ml of sterile  \nice cold TfbII (10 mM Na-MOPS, 10 mM KCl, 75  mM CaCl2    and 15 % Glycerol). The \ncompetent cells were aliquoted gently on dry ice in 50 \u00b5l fractions into 0.5 ml \nmicrocentrifuge tubes and stored at -80 \u00b0C.  \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n75 \n \n2.2.1.2.2 Ligation of DNA fragments to pGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector (Promega) \npGEM\u00ae-T Easy Vector is a high-copy-number plasmid containing T7 and SP6 RNA \npolymerase binding site.

In the next day, the media was transferred into 25 ml fresh sterile S.O.B. enriched by \nthe antibiotics and kept in the shaker until OD600 reached 0.6-0.8. From that culture,  1 ml \nwas taken and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 10 minutes using bench centrifuge (Eppendorf, \ncentrifuge 5415R) and the cell pellet was kept in -20 \u00b0C (a zero time sample). IPTG was \nthen added to the culture in concentration of 100 mM and the culture was put again at 37 \n\u00b0C at 200 rpm in the shaker. Every one hour, for four times, 1 ml was removed and \ncentrifuged for preparation of cell pellets.  \n \nAfter that, each pellet was re-suspended in 100 \u00b5l of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The \nsuspension was subjected to 3-4 cycles of freezing and thawing in methanol\/dry ice and 42 \n\u00b0C. The samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes at the maximum speed.

Butanol (Sigma-Alrich, B7906) was added on the top of the gel to \nprevent air bubble formations. The gel was left for 45-60 minutes at room temperature until  \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n88 \n \ncompletely polymerized. Butanol was washed away with distilled water then dried by the \nfiltered paper. The stacking was prepared from the following amounts which are enough for \ntwo mini-gels [(4.1 ml dH2O, 1 ml 30% Acrylamide\/bis-Acrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich, \nA3699), 0.75 ml 1.5 M Tris (pH 8.8) (Sigma-Aldrich,T6066),  0.06 ml 10 % SDS (Fisher \nScientific, BP 166-500), 0.06 ml 10% ammonium persulphate and 0.006 ml TEMED which \nwas  mixed immediately before pouring the gel]. The stacking gel was poured on the \nsurface of the resolving gel until reaching the upper border of the short plate.  \n \nThe clean comb was then placed to construct the wells. The gel was left for 30-45 minutes \nuntil occurrence of complete polymerization. The comb was removed and the wells were \nwashed by distilled water. The gel cassettes were placed in the electrode assembly and put \ninside the tank filled with SDS-PAGE running buffer (SDS-PAGE buffer (10x) is \ncomposed of 30.3 g Tris base,144 g  Glycine, 10g SDS  and complete to 1L with dH2O,  pH \n8.3).  \n \nTo prepare protein sample for loading on SDS-PAGE  gel, 15 \u00b5l from each  protein sample  \nwas mixing with 5 \u00b5l 5% mercaptoethanol loading buffer  (5.8 ml 1 M Tris pH 6.8, 0.83g \nSDS, 2.5 ml glycerol, 1 mg bromophenol blue and completed to 10 ml with dH2O) and \nboiled at 95 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. In addition to the proteins samples, 10 \u00b5l of protein marker, \nSeeBlue Plus2 PreStained Standard (Invitrogen, LC925), was loaded in the first well. The \npower was applied to the cell and the electrophoresis was run using 120 V constant until \nthe front dye reaches the lower end. \n \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n89 \n \n2.2.1.4.3.2 Coomassie blue staining of the SDS-PAGE gel \nOn litre of Coomassie blue solution was prepared (600 mg Coomassie Blue R250 (Serva, \n17525), 260 ml water, 240 ml methanol and 100 ml acetic acid) and stored at room \ntemperature for up to six months. After the end of the gel electrophoresis, gels were \nimmersed immediately in the Coomassie Blue solution in a plastic box with a lid and left \nfor 1 hour on a rocking platform at room temperature. The excess stain was removed and a \nde-staining solution (30% methanol and 10% acetic acid) was poured over the gel. The de-\nstaining solution was changed every ten minutes for three times. Then the gel was kept in \n50 % de-staining solution overnight on the rock platform in a tightly sealed box to prevent \nthe gel from drying. The gel was examined for seeing the band of increasing intensity at the \nexpected size range for each protein and then scanned.   \n \n2.2.1.4.3.3 Western blotting of the expressed SM-CRT sub-fragments (Towbin et al. \n1979)  \nTo confirm expression of the proteins, Western blot analysis was performed using Mini \nTrans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 170-3930). A piece of \nnitro-cellulose paper (Bio-rad, 162-0097) was cut slightly larger than the gel and marked by \npen on the surface that will face the gel. In a large plate contained transfer buffer (for 1 L \nvolume; 2.9 g Glycine, 5.8 g Tris, 0.37 g SDS, 200 ml Methanol and d H2O to 1 L, pH 8.3), \nthe Gel Holder Cassette was opened and on its black cathode site, the sandwich was formed \nin the following order: one Fiber pad, filter paper, the SDS-PAGE gel, nitrocellulose \nmembrane, the other filter paper and finally the other Fiber pad. Then the cassette was \nclosed and transferred into the tank full of the transfer blotting buffer. A frozen Bio-Ice \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n90 \n \ncooling unit was put alongside the gel holder to cool the system while running. The current \nwas adjusted to 300 milliampire for 45-60 minutes. \n \nAfter that, the membrane was removed from the cassette and transferred into the blocking \nbuffer (5% skimmed milk in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature on a shaking \nplatform. Monoclonal anti-polyhistidine peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, A7058) (1:4000 in \nthe blocking buffer) was incubated with the membrane for 1 hour on the shaking  platform. \nThe membrane was washed three times, 10 minutes each using 0.05%Tween-20\/PBS. The \nsignal was detected by chemiluminescence technique using ECL Western Blotting \nSubstrate system (Pierce, 32106). The detection reagents 1 (peroxide) and 2 (luminal) were \nmixed in equal volume and were added to the membrane. After incubation for 1 minute, the \nexcess reagents were removed and the membrane was completely covered with clean \nplastic sheet. In dark room, the membrane with its previously marked protein side was \nincubated with X-ray film (Kodak, Z35, 847-9) in the film cassette for 1-5 minutes. The \nfilm was put in the developer solution (AGFA, G153A) and shaken until the signal \nappeared, then it was transferred to the fixer solution (AGFA, G153B). The film was put \nagain on the membrane in the light to mark the bands of the pre-stained standard protein \nmarker on the film. The film was washed with running tap water and left in the room \ntemperature until dried. \n2.2.1.4.4 Large scale production of SM-CRT sub-fragments  \nTo produce recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments in large amounts, the basic steps of \nprotein expression described in the section of preliminary protein expression were followed \nwith increased the volumes of bacterial media.

In the next \nday, the overnight culture was aseptically transferred into 400ml of fresh media, enriched \nwith antibiotics, in autoclaved 2 litre flask (total volume 1 litter for each protein). The \nFlasks were put in the shaker in the same conditions until OD600 reached 0.6-0.7, then \nsterile IPTG in end concentration of 100 mM was added to the cultures which were put \nback to the shaker for 2-3 hours. The cultures were centrifuged in large centrifuge Backman \n500 ml tubes with 4000 rpm at 4\u00b0C (Beckman Coulter, Avanti J-E Centrifuge) for 20 \nminutes and the cell pellets were stored in -20 \u00b0C until used. \n \n2.2.1.5 Purification of the recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments  \n2.2.1.5.1 Preparation of protein samples   \nEach SM-CRT sub-fragment was purified by nearly the same methods. The pellets, derived \nfrom 1 litre of the IPTG induced culture, were collectively re-suspended in 25 ml his-tag \naffinity chromatography buffer A (20 mM Tris HCl, 500 mM   NaCl and  5 mM Imidazole, \npH 8.0). The proteinase inhibitor, Pefabloc SC (Roche, 11 429 868 001) was added in \nconcentration of 4 mM. The media was subjected to three cycles of freezing in \nmethanol\/dry ice, heat shock at 42 \u00b0C and three 20 seconds bursts of sonication (Sanyo \nMSE, London, U.K., Soniprep 150). The destroyed cells were centrifuged at 15000 rpm for \n30 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes and were filtered using \n0.45 \u00b5m filter to get red of the cell debris and cell genome which could block the purifier \ncolumns.  \n \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n92 \n \n2.2.1.5.2 The methods used for SM-CRT sub-fragments the purifications \nThe buffers were prepared from nanopure water and they were filtered using 0.45 \u00b5m filters \nand they could be used within one week or filtered again. FPLC Amersham with Unicorn \n5.01 programme was used in the process of protein purifications. \n \n2.2.1.5.2.1 His-tag affinity chromatography  \nThe proteins were produced as fusion proteins with a Histidine-tag added on their N-\nterminal end to facilitate purification. The principle of affinity chromatography is that there \nis a ligand which is bound to the chromatography matrix, and protein bound reversibly and \nspecifically to this ligand. The protein is then eluted by using another competitive ligand, \nimidazole. \n \nThe proteinase inhibitor, Pefabloc SC was added in concentration of 4 mM to the sample \nbefore applied to the column. HiTrap Chelating HP column, 5 ml (GE Healthcare, 17-0409-\n01) was used in performing the process of purification. HiTrap Chelating HP column is pre-\npacked with 5 ml of Chelating Sepharose\u2122 High Performance which is agarose beads \ncoupled to the chelating iminodiacetic acid. The new column was prepared by application \nof 5 CV (column volume) distilled water by syringe drop by drop to wash out the 20 % \nethanol inside the column. After that, 10 ml 100 mM NiCl2 (Sigma, N 5756) (2 CV) was \nused to charge the column. The excess unbound Ni was removed by application of 3-5 CV \ndistilled water. The column is now ready to be applied on the machine.  \n \nBy using FLPC, Amersham set up with Unicorn 5.01 programme, HiTrap Chelating HP \ncolumn  was equilibrated with 5 CV (column volume)  of binding buffer, buffer A (20 mM \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n93 \n \nTris HCl, 500 mM NaCl and  5 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0)  at the flow rat 5 ml \/min and the \nprotein was loaded into the column automatically by FLPC machine. After that, the elution \nbuffer, buffer B (20 mM Tris HCl, 500 mM NaCl and 500 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) was \nmixed automatically according the programme using linear gradient elution method. The \neluted fractions corresponding to the peak representing the purified SM-CRT sub-fragment \n(on the chromatogram) were collected and analysed. It was found that most of the proteins \nrequired further exchange chromatography. \n \n2.2.1.5.2.2 Ion Exchange chromatography   \nThe protein purified with His-tag affinity chromatograph buffer (20-25% buffer b) was \ndesalted by de-salting buffer (20 mM  Tris HCl and 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) using HiPrep\u2122 \n26\/10 Desalting Column with the FLPC machine. The diluted protein sample was \nconcentrated with Millipore's Amicon\u00ae Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, \nUFC900308 and UFC901008) to be 25-30 ml. After that, the sample was subjected to anion \nion exchange using HiTap Q HP, 5 ml (GE Healthcare, 17-1153-01) column. This column \ncontains Q Sepharose High Performance anion exchanger media and the charged group is \nCH2N+ (CH3)3. The proteins were buffered at few pH units above their iso-electric point, so \nthey become a negatively charged and bound to the anion exchanger.  \n \nAfter washing the preservative from the column with 5 CV of buffer A (20 mM Tris HCl  \nand 20 mM NaCl, pH 8.0),  the column was equilibrated with 5 CV of buffer A. The \nprotein sample was loaded into the column in the washing buffer, buffer A at a rate of 5 ml \n\/min automatically by the programme. The elution buffer, buffer B (20 mM Tris HCl and   \n1M NaCl, pH 8.0) was applied automatically into the column to elute the target protein \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n94 \n \naccording the programme. The elution was carried out with increasing salt concentration \n(ionic concentration) by using linear gradient method. With increasing salt concentration, it \ncompetes with the proteins which are bound to the charged medium in the column \nlaunching elution starting with the proteins with weak net charges. The fractions \nrepresenting the SM-CRT peak on the chromatogram was collected and analysed.  \n \n2.2.1.5.2.3 Dialysis and concentration of the purified SM-CRT sub-fragments   \n HiPrep\u2122 26\/10 Desalting Column was used to dialysis the proteins into a physiological \nbuffer (20 mM Tris HCl and 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The protein sample was concentrated \nwith Millipore's Amicon\u00ae Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, UFC900308 and \nUFC901008). The filter device with cut off 3 kDa were loaded with SM-CRT N-, P-, C- \nand S-domains, whereas 10 kDa for other SM-CRT sub-fragments. The centrifugal filter \ntube was firstly rinsed with the dialysing buffer by centrifugation for few minutes at 4 \u00b0C at \n4000 xg. After discarding the buffer, dialysed protein sample was added in the filter unit \nand centrifuged at 4000 xg at 4 \u00b0C for 30-45 minutes and proteins was withdrawn from the \nbottom of the unit.  \n \n2.2.1.5.2.4 Measurement of protein concentrations  \nCoomassie Plus\u2013\u201cThe Better Bradford Assay\u201d (Pierce, 23236) was used for the \nmeasurement of the proteins concentration. The diluted bovin serum albumin (BSA) \nstandards were prepared according to the manufacturer instructions using the diluent\u2019s \nbuffer of the protein. The Coomassie Plus Reagent solution bottle was brought from the \nfridge and inverted several times and the calculated amount was poured into a universal \ntube which left to be equilibrated in the room temperature. After that, 50 \u00b5l from each \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n95 \n \npreviously prepared standard BSA concentrations and the unknown protein sample was \nadded into labelled 5 ml universal tube. Then, 1.5 ml of the Coomassie Plus Reagent \nsolution was added to each tube, mixed and left at room temperature for 10 minutes. After \nthat, 1 ml from each tube was transferred into cuvette tube and water was used to zero the \nspectrophotometer which was adjusted at 595 nm. The blank (the protein diluent) OD595 \nreading was subtracted from all the readings. The standard curve was constructed between \nthe OD595 readings and the corresponding protein concentration of the standard BSA at \u00b5g \n\/ml. From the equation generated from that curve, the unknown proteins concentration was \ncalculated. \n \n2.2.1.5.2.5 Storing of the purified SM-CRT sub-fragments   \nThe protein was aliquoted in small clean microcentrifuge tubes labelled by identity, \nconcentration and date. The tubes containing proteins were at first put in the liquid nitrogen \nbriefly, to prevent protein precipitation, and then put at -80 \u00b0C.  \n \n2.2.2 Characterization of SM-CRT sub-fragments  \n2.2.2.1 SM-CRT sub-fragment calcium binding assays \nThe ability of the recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments to bind calcium was studied by \nstaining with \u201cStains-all\u201d stain and by interacting with radioactive calcium. \n \n2.2.2.1.1 Staining SDS-PAGE gel by Stains-all stain (Campbell et al. 1983) \n\u201cStains-all\u201d is a cationic carbocyanine dye that stain the calcium binding proteins blue.  The \ndevelopment of blue colour arise from J complex formation that results from interaction of \nindividual molecules of the dye  with the anionic sites on Ca\n2+  \nbinding \n \nproteins whether  \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n96 \n \nsialic acid, phosphoryl groups or amino acid residues,   while the non-calcium binding \nproteins accept pink colour. \n \nAt first, each SM-CRT sub-fragment was mixed with the loading protein dye (containing 5 \n% mercaptoethanol) in the ratio 3:1 and heated for 5 minutes on heat block at 95 \u00b0C.  In one \n15% SDS-PAGE gel, 5 \u00b5g was loaded from each of the following proteins: N-, P-, C-, NS- \nand NP-domains in addition to calmodulin (Sgma-Alrich, P114405) (as a positive control), \nand BSA  (Sgma-Alrich, A9647) (as a negative control). Another 15% SDS-PAGE gel was \nloaded also with 5 \u00b5g of SM-CRT NPC-, S-, SP-, SPC- and PC-domains,  calmodulin and \nBSA. In each gel, 10\u00b5l protein marker (SeeBlue Plus2 PreStained Standard) was loaded in \nfirst lane of each gel. After running the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the gels were \ntransferred to 25% isopropyl alcohol overnight for fixation. In the following day, the gels \nwere washed by 25% isopropyl alcohol several times to remove the excess of SDS, then the \ngel was completely immersed in \u201cStains-all\u201d solution (30 mM Tris base, 7.5% formamide, \n25% isopropyl alcohol and 0.0025% Stains-all,  pH 8.8)  in a plastic box which wrapped \nwith aluminum foil and left in the dark for 48 hours.  Then, gels were examined and \nscanned. \n \n2.2.2.1.2 Binding with \n45 \nCa\n2+\n assay\n \nTwo mini 15% PAGE gels (without SDS) were prepared. The gels were transferred into \nMini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell containing running buffer. 5 \u00b5g from each SM-CRT (in \naddition, calmodulin as a positive control and 5\u00b5g BSA as a negative control) was mixed \nwith the non-denature protein loading buffer (without mercaptoethanol) in the ratio 3:1. \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n97 \n \nThe gels were loaded with the prepared proteins samples and protein ladder in the same \norder mentioned in section 2.2.2.1.1.  \n \nWhen the front dye reaches the end of the gel, the gels were immediately blotted into \nnitrocellulose membrane using native Western blot buffer (the Western blot analysis is \ndescribed in more detail in section 2.2.1.4.3.3). After finishing the process of blotting, the \nmembranes were immediately incubated for 1 hour with a solution composed of 60 mM \nKCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM imidazole, pH 6.8. This solution was changed several times \nduring the incubation period. After that, the membranes were immersed for 10 minutes into \nthe same buffer which was supplemented with \n45 \nCa\n2+\n (1mCi\/L). The membranes were then \nwashed with distilled water several times for 10 minutes each to remove excess unbound \nradioactive calcium and left to dry on filter papers at room temperature for one hour. The \nmembrane was exposed to X-ray film for 48 hours at -80\u00baC. The signals were developed by \nexposure to the developer solution then fixed with fixer buffer (see section 2.2.1.4.3.3). \n \n2.2.2.2  Interaction of the recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments with C1q, the classical \ncomplement pathway recognition molecule \n \n2.2.2.2.1 Assessment SM-CRT sub-fragments binding with C1q using ELISA \n One Nunc Maxisorb (Fischer scientific) plate was coated with SM-CRT domains N-, P-, \nC-, S-, NPC- and (BSA as a negative control), while NS-, NP-, SP-, SPC-, PC-domain and \nBSA were added to another plate.

The \nplates were warpped in a cling film and left at 4 \u00baC overnight. The next day, the non \nspecific binding sites were blocked with 250 \u00b5l 3% (w\/v) BSA \/PBS for each well and left \n2 hours at room temperature. The plates were washed four times by 250 \u00b5l \nPBS\/0.005%T\/well. Double serial dilutions of human C1q (Sigma-Aldrich, C1740) in \nduplicates starting from 0.4 \u00b5g (in 100 \u00b5l of 1% (w\/v) BSA\/ 0.005%T\/ PBS per well) were \nincubated with each coated protein and the last row did not receive C1q and left as blank.  \nAfter incubating the plates for 2 hours at 37 \u00baC, they  were washed and anti-human C1q \nanti-serum developed in sheep (Immune system, SC1Q-80A) was added in dilution of 1: \n200 in PBS\/ 0.05%T and left while warpped in cling film at 4 \u00baC overnight. The following \nday, the plates were washed four times and then anti-sheep IgG conjugated to alkaline \nphosphatase (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, A5187) in the dilution of 1:5000 in PBS\/0.05%T was \nincubated with plates for 2 hours at 37 \u00baC. The plates were washed four times for the last \ntime and the reactions were developed by putting 100 \u00b5l\/well p-nitrophenyl phosphate \nsubstrate (Sigma, SIGMAFAST\u00e4 p-Nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets, N1891). When the \nyellow colour developed, the reaction was read at 405 nm wave length using ELISA reader \n(Bio-Rad, Model 680). The experiment was repeated three times. \n \n2.2.2.2.2 Inhibition of C1q-dependent blood haemolysis by  SM-CRT sub-fragments  \n \nTo test if SM-CRT binding with C1q will affect biological functions of C1q, the C1q \ndependent blood haemolysis was performed.  \n \n \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n99 \n \n2.2.2.2.2.1 Preservation of Sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) in Alsever\u2019s medium \n On ice, 10 ml fresh sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (Innovative research, IC100-0210) was \nmixed with equal volume of Alsever\u2019s solution (Sigma, A3551). The mixture was \ncentrifuged for 10 minutes with 1200 xg at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded and the \nSRBC pellet was re-suspended with 10 ml Alsever\u2019s solution by inverting the tube gently \nseveral times. These cells were aliquoted and kept in the fridge for one month. \n \n 2.2.2.2.2.2 Preparation of 5% Sheep red blood cells (SRBCs)= 5 x10\n8\n cells\/ml \nIn 50 ml Falcon tube containing  40 ml of ice cold BBS (4 mM barbital,145 mM  NaCl,1 \nmM MgCl2 and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), 5 ml of  processed SRBC was mixed gently  and \ncentrifuged for 10 minutes with 1200 x g at 4 \u00baC. The supernatant was discarded and \nSRBCs pellet was re-suspended with fresh 40 ml of ice cold BBS. The process of \ncentrifugation and re-suspension in 40 ml of ice cold BBS was repeated twice, then  the \nsupernatant was discarded and 500 \u00b5l of that cell pellet was mixed gently with 9.5 ml of ice \ncold BBS in a new tube. From this mixture,100 \u00b5l was diluted  with 1.4 ml water, vortexed \nand O.D. was measured at 541nm with using a blank of 100 \u00b5l of BBS  diluted with 1.4 ml \nwater. The checked O.D. should be 0.7 (\u00b15%) and if not, it was adjusted with following \nformula: \n   Total Volume (ml) for 5% SRBC= The measured O.D. x total volume (10 ml)\/ 0.7 \nThese cells were suitable to be used for two weeks and should be diluted 1:5 before using. \n \n2.2.2.2.2.3 Preparation of 2% Sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) \n From the previously prepared (SRBCs) pellet, 250 \u00b5l was added to 12.5 ml of BBS.

To prepare 2% \nSRBCs, O.D. should be 0.5 and the following formula was used to adjust the O.D.: \nTotal Volume (ml) for 2% SRBC= the measured O.D. x total volume (12.5 ml)\/0.5 \nThese cells were kept in the fridge for two weeks. \n \n2.2.2.2.2.4 Titration of hemolysin (rabbit anti-sheep red cell stroma) \nHemolysin (Sigma-Aldrich, S1389) was serially diluted in BBS from 1:100 until 1:12800 \nand 50 \u00b5l from each dilution was mixed with 50 \u00b5l of 2% SRBC in 96 well V-bottom plates \n(Fisher Scientific). This plate was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes, and then \n150 \u00b5l of diluted fresh guinea pig serum (Harlan Laboratories U.K. Ltd S.R-0006B) in \ndilution of 1:10 was mixed with each prepared mixture. The plate was sealed completely \nwith Cling film and put in water bath at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes, then it was centrifuged at \n1200 xg for 10 minutes (Beckman coulter, Allegra X-12). The chosen hemolysin dilution \nwas the one directly before the dilution with visible SRBC sedimentation. \n \nThis hemolysin titer was confirmed by mixing 0.5 ml with 0.5 ml of 2% SRBCs and left at \nroom temperature for 10 minutes. Then, 1 ml of fresh guinea pig serum (1: 200) was added \nand the sample was put in the water bath at 37 \u00b0C for 60 minutes. After that, the sample \nwas centrifuged at 1200 x g for 10 minutes and the O.D. was measured at 541 nm using \nBBS as blank. This reading was compared to a complete lysis made by mixing 0.5 ml of \n2% SRBC  with 7 ml water with the following formula:- \nThe measured O.D. x 100\/ O.D. of the complete haemolysis.  \n(70-80% haemolysis was achieved as expected). \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n101 \n \n2.2.2.2.2.5 Sensitizing of 5% Sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) with hemolysin \nThe chosen hemolysin dilution was gently mixed with 5% SRBCs by 1:1. This was done by \nadding the SRBCs drop by drop to the hemolysine while shaking the tube gently. This \nmixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. These sensitized SRBCs were stored at 4 \u00baC \nand it could be used for 1 week. The working dilution of SRBCs-hemolysin is 10\n8 \ncells\/ ml, \ntherefore, this should be diluted 1:5 of cold BBS before use. \n \n2.2.2.2.2.6 Preparation of sera used in  the haemolysis inhibition assay  \ni) Choosing the dilution of Normal Human serum (NHS) that cause 70-80% \nhaemolysis \nNHS was serially diluted starting at 1:20 until 1:1280 and 100 \u00b5l from each dilution was \ntransferred into 96 well V-shaped bottom plate. Similar volume (100 \u00b5l) of SRBCs-\nhemolysin (1x 10\n 8\n cells\/ ml, sensitized 5% sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) with hemolysin \nwhich was diluted 1:5 before use) was added into each dilution. The plate was sealed in \ncling film and incubated in water bath 37 \u00b0C for one hour. Then 50 \u00b5l of cold BBS was \nadded to each well and they were centrifuged at 1200 xg for 10 minutes. The supernatants \nwere transferred to new flat bottom plate and O.D. of the supernatant which contains \nhemoglobin was measured at 405 nm. Spontaneous 0% haemolysis was produced by \nincubation of 100 \u00b5l SRBCs-hemolysin without serum, whereas 100 % haemolysis was \nachieved by incubating 100 \u00b5l SRBCs-hemolysin with 100 \u00b5l of water, all in the same \nplate. The haemolytic activity is calculated as a percentage from the total haemolysis after \nsubtraction of the background haemolysis. The NHS dilution which achieved 70-80% \nhemolysis was selected to perform the assay. \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n102 \n \nii)  Reconstitution of human C1q deficient serum  \n Human C1q deficient serum (Calbiochem, 234401) was diluted 1:40 in BBS, then100 \u00b5l \nwas added to each well of V-shaped bottom plat (for 12 wells).

Then, 100 \u00b5l of \nsensitized SRBCS (10\n8   \ncells\/ml) was added to each well and left for another 30 minutes. \nThe plate was centrifuged at 1200 xg for 10 minutes. The supernatants were transferred into \nflat bottom 96 plat and the O.D. of the supernatants which were detected at 405 nm using \nBBS as the blank. The back ground haemolysis was prepared from the sensitized SRBCS \ncells without any serum whereas the 100 % haemolysis was measured by mixing 100 \u00b5l \nsensitized SRBCS cells with 100\u00b5l water and both were put in the same plate during the \nwhole process. The chosen amount of the C1q, is the amount which when re-backed to 1:40 \nof C1q deficient serum makes the reconstituted serum causing 70-80 % haemolysis . \n \n2.2.2.2.2.7 C1q dependent haemolytic inhibition assay  \nIn the case of NHS, 100 \u00b5l of 1:160 NHS was added in V-shaped bottom 96 wells in \nduplicates. Then, 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20 \u00b5M of each SM-CRT sub-fragment were mixed with \nserum and the plate was sealed and incubated at 37\u00b0C in the water bath for 1 hour. After \nthat, 100 \u00b5l sensitized 5% SRBCs (1x 10\n 8\n cells\/ml) was added for each well and re-\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C for further 1 hour. Negative control was done with 200 \u00b5l blood cells \nalone and the 100 % haemolysis was done by mixing 100 \u00b5l of the cells with 100 \u00b5l with \nwater, all in  the same plate. After the incubation, 50 \u00b5l BBS was added to each well and \nthe plate was centrifuged for 10 minute at 1200 xg and 200 \u00b5l supernatant from each well \nwas transferred to flat bottom well and O.D. was read at 405 nm to calculate the hemolysis. \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n103 \n \nIn the case of C1q depleted sera, the same process was used but each protein concentration \nwas mixed first with 0.125 \u00b5g C1q then the mixture was transferred to 100 \u00b5l 1: 40 C1q \ndeficient serum and the rest of procedures were followed as before. For each serum the \nexperiment was done three times in duplicate.  \n \n2.2.2.3 Testing immunogenicity of the recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments \n2.2.2.3.1 Anti-SM-CRT rabbit anti-serum production  \nA Rabbit was immunised at Harlan laboratories, U.K.. The recombinant SM-CRT NPC-\ndomain was adjusted to 1mg\/ ml. New Zealand white rabbit was injected S.C. at 4 sites \nwith 0.5 mg of the protein (500\u00b5l) plus 500 \u00b5l Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant in 1 ml total \nvolume. Every two weeks, the rabbit received 4 booster doses but in Freund\u2019s incomplete \nadjuvant. At termination, the blood was collected and left to clot on ice, then serum was \nobtained and kept at -20 \u00b0C. \n \n2.2.2.3.2 Preparation of  BL21 (DE3)pLysS cell lysate \nFrom the bacterial BL21 (DE3)pLysS stock, 2-3\u00b5l was inoculated into 10 ml L.B., without \nantibiotic, and incubated  at 200 rpm at 37 \u00b0C overnight. In the next morning, the bacteria \nwere harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. The cell pellet was re-\nsuspended in 3 ml PBS and subjected to three 20 seconds bursts of sonication. The bacterial \ndebris were then centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. The supernatant was \ncollected and the protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay and stored at -20 \n\u00b0C.   \n \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n104 \n \n2.2.2.3.3  SM-CRT sub-fragments  probing with anti-SM-CRT rabbit anti-serum by \nWestern blotting analysis \nTo test the immunoginicity of SM-CRT, the specific anti-SM-CRT rabbit anti-serum was \ntested against different recombinant SM-CRT proteins. At first, 3ug of each recombinant \nNPC-domain, BSA and E.coli lysates (both were used as negative controls) were loaded \ninto 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were blotted into nitrocellulose membrane. The \nmembrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk in TBS for 30 minutes, then the specific anti-\nSM-CRT rabbit anti-serum in 1: 40 was incubated and left at 4\u00b0C overnight at shaker \nplatform. In the next day, the membrane was washed with 0.005%T\/ TBS three times, 10 \nminutes each, and anti-Rabbit IgG (whole molecule)\u2013Alkaline Phosphatase antibody \nproduced in goat (Sigma, A3812) was added in the concentration of 1:10000 and left at \nroom temperature for 90 minutes at shaker platform. The membrane was washed three \ntimes, then BCIP\/NBT Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate (Sigma-Alderich, B1911-100ml) \nwas added on the membrane that was observed for the colour development, then the \nreaction was stopped by immersing the membrane in distilled water.  \n \nAfter confirmation of the immunogenicity of the NPC-domain, the anti-SM-CRT rabbit \nanti-serum was used to probe the different SM-CRT sub-fragments in Western blotting. \nTwo SDS-PAGE gels were prepared and loaded with 3 \u00b5g from each protein.  One  15% \nSDS-PAGE gel loaded with N-, P-, C-, NS- and NP-domains,  in addition to  BSA and  E. \ncoli lysate (as negative control) and NPC-domain (as positive control), while the other was  \n12% SDS-PAGE gel which was  loaded with  S-,  SP-,  SPC- and  PC-domain, in addition \nto the similar  positive and negative controls used in the first gel. Then whole process was \nrepeated as occurred with the NPC-domain in the same section. \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n105 \n \n2.2.2.3.4  SM-CRT sub-fragments probing with anti-SM-CRT rabbit anti-serum by \nELISA \nAnti-SM-CRT anti-serum was used for identification of the protein by ELISA. The Nunc \nMaxisorb plates were coated with 0.5 \u00b5g from SM-CRT NPC-domain, in addition to BSA \nas a negative control in carbonate\/bicarbonate buffer and left overnight at 4\u00b0C. The \nfollowing morning, the plates were blocked with 1%BSA\/ TBS for 2-3 hours and after \nwashing for four times with TBS\/0.05% Tween-20\/5 mM CaCl2, the anti-SM-CRT anti-\nserum was incubated in dilution of 1:1000, 1:10000 and 1:50000 and left at room \ntemperature for 1 hour, then washed four times and they incubated with AP-rabbit \nantibodies in dilution of 1:10000 for 90 minutes.  Plates were washed for the last time and \np-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added at 100\u00b5l\/well. When the yellow colour \ndeveloped, the OD405 was read. \n \nThe ELISA was repeated by using different SM-CRT sub-fragments in two plates coated \nwith 0.5 \u00b5g\/well from each protein.

The plates \nwere washed and then p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added with 100\u00b5l\/well. When \nthe yellow colour developed, plates were read at OD405, until the highest reading of S. \nmansoni infected serum reached 1-1.5 units. \n \n Equal volumes of 15 sera which gave the highest OD405 readings were pooled to prepare \nthe positive reference standard serum. This serum was aliquoted and stored until used.  In \nthe same time equal volumes of sera (21) of healthy European persons were pooled to \ngenerate the negative control standard reference serum. \n \nTo select the individual serum dilution, for SM-CRT sub-fragment in the concentration of  \n5 \u00b5g\/ml,  0.4 \u00b5g \/ml of CTF  and SEA in 1 \u00b5g\/ml  were used. The positive and negative \nstandard reference sera were incubated with each protein in duplicates. They were serially \ndiluted from 1: 20 in the blocking buffer in duplicate following the same steps of ELISA \nmentioned above. From the end point titre, the optimal individual serum was selected from \nthe linear part of the standard curve of the positive standard serum. From that end point \ntitres, 1: 200 was chosen for all antigens except for SM-CRT   P-, S-, SP-, C- and PC-\ndomains where 1:100 was used. Concerning the AP-conjugated Anti-Human IgG (whole \nmolecule) secondary antibodies the secondary antibodies different dilutions were tried \n(1:10000 or 1:5000 or 1:2000) and the latter dilution was found to allow quicker \ndevelopment of the reaction.  \n \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n113 \n \nii) ELISA for detection of specific antibodies against used S. mansoni antigens in  \ndifferent human sera  groups  \nThe same ELISA methodology was followed. The proteins were coated as mentioned \nabove. The sera were diluted in the blocking buffer. In each plate, the first two columns \n(1& 2) were incubated with serial dilutions of the previously prepared positive standard \nreference serum starting at 1:20 in duplicate. The last two wells of the first two columns \n(H1& H2) received all the reagents but not sera. Each plate included the quality control sera \nwhich are 5 S. mansoni negative sera from the healthy European donors as a negative \ncontrol and 5 S. mansoni +Ve as a positive control. The quality control sera were incubated \nin the same locations on all plates. The rest of the plate received 30 individual test sera.  \nWhen the colour developed, O.D. was read until the reading of 1:20 of the standard positive \nreference serum reached 1-1.5 units. \n \nTo correct for variations within the ELISA plates, the O.D. was converted to relative \nantibody titre. The standard serum was assigned an arbitrary antibody titre of 1.0 and the \ntitre of the samples calculated from the equation of the standard curve.  \n \nFor assay quality control, both an inter-assay and intra-assay coefficient of variation \npercent (CV %) was calculated. Within the same plate, CV% was calculated among the \nrelative antibody titres  of the 10 quality control sera duplicates by using the following \nformula= 100x (mean of SD of the relative antibody titres of the  duplicates \/ mean of the \nduplicates). All the plates achieved intra-assay CV% within range of 3.5-6% which is less \nthan 10%, the acceptable CV%. The inter-assay variations among the plates was also \nestimated. The inter-assay CV% = 100 X (\u2211 SD of the relative antibodies titres of the \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n114 \n \nquality control duplicates among plates \/ \u2211 means of the same samples). The inter-assay \nvariation was <12%. \n \n2.2.3.4 Detection of specific anti-human CRT antibodies in sera of autoimmune \npatients \nSpecific antibodies against human CRT were detected in the sera of autoimmune patients \nby ELISA. The plate was coated with 0.5 \u00b5g of recombinant human CRT (Abcam, \nab15729). The autoimmune sera which cross-reacted with SM-CRT was pooled together to \nconstruct a positive standard serum. The standard serum was serially diluted from 1: 20 and \nincubate with plate in duplicate. In the same ELISA plate, each individual serum \nautoimmune sera or the U.K. controls was incubated at 1: 200. The ELISA was performed \nas in section 2.2.4.2.3. \n \n2.2.5  Vaccination of BALB\/c mouse with SM-CRT NPC-domain \nMice immunisation and portal perfusion of S. mansoni infected mice were kindly carried \nout by Prof. Mike Doenhoff, University of Nottingham where the S. mansoni life cycle is \nestablished. \n \n2.2.5.1 Testing the immunogenicity of recombinant SM-CRT NPC-domain  \nA preliminary experiment was performed to test the immunogenicity of the recombinant \nHis-tag fusion SM-CRT NPC-domain in BALB\/c mouse strain which will be further \ninfected by S. mansoni cercariae.  \n \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n115 \n \n2.2.5.1.1 BALB\/c mouse immunisations with SM-CRT NPC-domain \nTwo  groups of mouse (4 in each group) were used. The immunized mouse group received \nthree doses of SM-CRT intraperitoneally at 2 weeks interval (at 0, 15 and 30 days).  The \nfirst protein  dose was 50 \u00b5g and the other two doses were 25 \u00b5g (the protein was dissolved \nin 100 \u00b5l PBS\/alum). The control mouse group received PBS + alum suspension at the \nsame time points. Blood was drawn from all mice before the first injection (time point 0) \nand two weeks after each dose. The collected blood was centrifuged at 1000 xg for 10 \nminutes and stored at -20\u00b0C until being shipped on dry ice to me at  University of Leicester.  \n \n2.2.5.1.2 Measurement of specific SM-CRT antibodies  \nThe profile of specific SM-CRT antibodies response was determined in the sera of \nimmunised mice by ELISA. The ELISA steps were described in detail in section 2.2.4.1.1. \nNunc Maxisorb plate was coated with 0.5\u00b5g\/well. Each mouse serum collected at the \ndifferent time points was incubated in duplicate at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 hour at the \nroom temperature. The plate was washed four times and secondary goat anti-mouse AP-\nconjugated IgG in dilution of 1: 10000 was added to the wells in 100 \u00b5l \/well and left for 90 \nminutes. After washing for the last time, p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added and \nwhen the yellow colour developed, the OD405 was read. \n \nTo evaluate the strength of immunogenicity of SM-CRT in BALB\/c mouse, SM-CRT \nspecific antibodies were measured  by ELISA in the  sera of the immunised mice at \ndifferent serum dilutions of 1:1000,  1:10000 and 1:50000 ( from the sera collected after the \nthird dose) in comparison  to the  control group. \n \n \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n116 \n \n2.2.5.2 BALB\/c mice immunisation & challenging with Schistosoma infection  \n \n2.2.5.2.1 Mice immunisations  \nAfter confirmation the immunogenicity of recombinant SM-CRT in BALB\/c mouse strain, \nthe actual mouse SM-CRT immunisation and Schistosoma infection experiment was \nperformed. Two mouse groups (5 mice in each group) were used.  The mice  immunisation, \nblood collection and measurement of specific antibodies were followed as before (see \nsection 2.2.5.1).   \n \n2.2.5.2.2 Preparation of cercariae for infection  \nThe infected snail were transferred from their water tank to be  put in beaker (in water bath \nat 30 \u00b0C) containing de-chlorinated de-ionized water  under  strong illumination for two \nhours to help the snail to shed cercariae. The water around the snail, which contains shed \ncercariae, was concentrated and cercariae were counted. Cercariae emerged from the snail \nwere used for mice infection within three hours after emergence from their snail host \n(Olivier 1966). \n \n2.2.5.2.3 Mice infection with S. mansoni cercariae (Doenhoff et al. 1978 adapted from \nSmithers& Terry 1965) \nThe mice were anaesthetized with Ket\/Dom mixture which was  given intra peritoneally \n(0.75 ml Ketamine plus 1 ml Domitor and 8.25 ml sterile isotonic saline, for a 20 g mouse, \n0.2 ml from this mixture is used). When the mice lost consciousness, each mouse was \nplaced on its back and its shaved abdomen was moistened with aquarium water. Then a \nnickel \u2013plated brass ring was taped over its abdomen. The volume of the prepared cercarial \nsuspension (between 0.1ml and 0.9 ml according to cercariae concentration obtained on the \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n117 \n \nday of infection)  which containes  200 cercariae were added to the ring.  The mice were \nleft for 20 minutes to allow cercariae penetration. After that, mice were allowed to recover \nby using Antisedan (0.2 ml Antisedan plus 9.8 ml saline and 0.2 ml from this dilution will \nreverse a 20 g mouse)  in a warm environment.  \n2.2.5.2.4 Perfusions of Schistosoma worms from portal vein (Doenhoff et al. 1978 \nadapted from Smithers& Terry 1965) \nAfter 42 days post-infection, the mice were anaesthetized terminally by injection of 0.2 ml \nSagatal containing 25 units of heparin (per mouse) intraperitoneally. The mouse abdominal \nand thoracic cavities were opened and the ribs were removed. The mouse was attached to a \nvertical Perspex board by clothes pegs. Then, 25 ml of perfusion fluid (8.6 g sodium \nchloride, 15 g trisodium citrate, 2000 units heparin and completed to 1 liter with distilled \nwater) was injected into the right ventricle. The perfusion solution coming from incision in \nthe mouse portal vein was collected in a beaker put below the mouse. The collected worms \nwere allowed to settle down, excess solution was removed and the erythrocytes in 1-1.5 ml \nof fluid were lysed with small volume of 2.5% Saponin. The perfused adult Schistosoma \nworms from each mouse were transferred into Petri dish and the numbers of male, female, \ntotal  and paired worms were counted under the dissecting microscope. \n \nThe level of protection % against Schistosoma caused by SM-CRT immunisation is \ncalculated by comparing the numbers of adult worms recovered from the immunised mouse \ngroup to the numbers of adult worms recovered from mouse control group using the \nfollowing formula (where C is the control group and V is the vaccinated mouse group): \nmean of  worms recovered from (C) group - mean of worms recovered from (V) group x 100 \n                                  mean of worms recovered from  (C) group \n Chapter 2                                                                                                Materials&Methods \n                                                                                                                               \n118 \n \n2.2.5.2.5 Schistosoma egg counting in the tissues (Doenhoff et al. 1978 adapted from \nCheever 1968) \nEach mouse liver was digested by putting in 15 ml 5% KOH overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Three 50 \n\u00b5l aliquots were transferred from the digested liver suspension onto microscopic slides. The \neggs were counted under x10 magnification in each aliquot. If any of the three replicate \ncounts deviated more than 10% from the mean count, other slides were prepared. Then, the \naverage of the three slides was taken and from this mean, the total numbers for each mouse \nwas calculated. In each group the numbers was expressed as a group mean. The same \nformula mentioned above is used to calculate mean % reduction in tissue eggs. \n \n2.2.5.2.6 Measurement of specific SM-CRT IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses by ELISA \nA coated ELISA plate with 0.5 \u00b5g \/ well of the recombinant SM-CRT NPC-domain was \nincubated by each mouse serum (from 2 weeks after the third immunisation) at 1: 200 for 1 \nhour. After washing, goat anti-mouse IgG1, Human ads-AP (Southernbiotech, 1070-04) or \ngoat anti-Mouse IgG2a, Human ads-AP (Southernbiotech, 1080-04) at 1:2000 dilution was \nincubated with the mouse sera for 90 minutes. After washing for the last time, p-\nnitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added and when the yellow colour developed, the \nOD405 was read. \n \nStatistical analysis was performed with unpaired Student\u2019s t-test using computer software \npackage GraphPad Prism 5.02 version to compare control and experimental groups.  There \nwere significant statistical difference when the P-value, compared to the control group, was \nlower than 0.05. \n Chapter 3                                                                Expression and purification of SM-CRT                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                               \n119 \n \n                                                       Chapter 3 \nExpression and purification of SM-CRT sub-fragments \n3.2 Results \n3.1.1 Amplification and cloning of SM-CRT sub-fragments \nThe SM-CRT was split into 10 different sub-fragments expressed as 6xHis-tagged fusion \nproteins.

When the OD600 \nof the bacterial culture reached 0.7-0.8, 1 ml was taken and then 100 mM IPTG was added. \nFor four times and every hour, 1 ml was taken from the culture. From the samples collected \nat these time points, a cell pellet was prepared by centrifugation. Each cell pellet containing \nthe recombinant SM-CRT fragment was re-suspended in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and \nsubjected to 3-4 cycles of freezing and thawing in methanol\/dry ice and a water bath of 42 \n\u00b0C. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2X SDS-PAGE buffer, whereas \nthe cell pellet was re-suspended in 100 \u00b5l 1X SDS-PAGE buffer.  \n \nIn the soluble cell lysates, expression of the recombinant SM-CRT fragments was \ndetectable even before IPTG induction, with variable degrees of intensity. After IPTG \ninduction, the amount of the recombinant proteins increased in correlation with the time of \ninduction as shown by the thickness of the protein bands in SDS-PAGE gel stained with \nCoomassie blue. The SM-CRT P-, C- and PC-domains were not detectable in the cell \npellets, whereas the SM-CRT N-domain and other fragments (containing the N-domain or \npart of it) appeared in the cell pellets but with at very low concentrations in comparison to \ntheir corresponding cell lysate (see Figure 12). \n \n \n \n \n \n Chapter 3                                                                Expression and purification of SM-CRT                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                               \n126 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nFigure 12: Pilot expression of SM-CRT sub-fragments.

From the  CRT gene  sequences established by Fliegel \net al. (1989) and Smith and Koch (1989), the protein sequences has been developed and \nshowed to comprise three functional and structural domains; the N-, P- and C-domain. A \nfunctional domain termed S-domain was late described with Stuart et al. (1996& 1997).   \n \n In my work, I split SM-CRT into ten sub-fragments; N-, P-, C-, NS-, NP-, NPC-, S-, SP-, \nSPC- and PC-domains. The aim of this splitting was to recognize which domain or domain \ncombination is more specific for detection of antibodies against SM-CRT in the sera of S. \nmansoni infected murine and humans. A cDNA library of adult S. mansoni was used to \namplify the coding cDNA sequences for these segments using PCR. The different coding \nregions of SM-CRT domains and sub-fragments were cloned (Figure 8, 9& 10), expressed \nusing the pRSETB vector in 6 Histidine-tag N-terminal fusion forms (Figure11, 12& 13) \nand purified (Figure 14 and 15) successfully.  \n \nThe amplified SM-CRT DNA sequences were identical to those published by Khalife et al. \n(1993). During PCR amplification, transcription errors were rare for the small segments, \nsuch as P-, C- and S-domains, but occurred when amplifying larger fragments like NP-, \nNS- and NPC-domains which required repeating the amplification attempts. \n \nThe pRSETB vector yields the production of recombinant proteins at high concentration \nand most of the domains were produced as soluble proteins. There are many other \nmicrobial protein expression systems that have been  used for CRT expression in various \n Chapter 3                                                                Expression and purification of SM-CRT                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                               \n139 \n \nspecies, for example  S. mansoni calreticulin was previously expressed using pGEX-2T \nplasmid expression vector (Khalife et al. 1993& 1994), S. japonicum CRT was expressed \nas a fusion protein using pTrcHis plasmid (Huggins et al. 1995), N. americanus \nrecombinant CRT was expressed by using pQE10 vector (Pritchard et al. 1999, Kasper et \nal. 2001, Winter et al. 2005), pQE vector expressed H. contortus CRT (Suchitra& Joshi \n2005), pTrxfus plasmid in thioredoxin fusion form  was applied  for production of human \nN-, P-, C- and S-domains (Stuart et al. 1997),  pMal-c2 expressed different human CRT \ndomains in maltose-binding forms (Kishore et al. 1997), Baksh& Michalak (1991) \nexpressed different human CRT domains in GST-fusion form using pGEX-3X plasmid and \nL. donovani CRT was expressed by using  pET-22b(+) plasmid (Debrabant et al. 2002).  \n \nSM-CRT N-domain was expressed mainly in soluble form, but cell pellets still contained \nsome insoluble protein (Figure 12) and this denotes the correct folding of the main bulk of \nthe expressed domain. This is somewhat different from what Baksh and Michalak (1991) \ndescribed. They expressed the human CRT N-domain as a GST fusion protein with only \n20% of the total protein was soluble.  Suchitra& Joshi (2005) have expressed H. contortus \ncalreticulin N-domain yielding an insoluble protein. This variation in the expressed N-\ndomain solubility may be due to the protein species, the expression vector, variation in \ndifferent conditions of protein expression  process such as incubation temperature, or the \nfact that, the  SM-CRT N-domain expressed in pRSETB has twenty extra residues added to \nthe N-terminus (encoded by the vector) which could increase the solubility of the \nrecombinant protein. \nSM-CRT NS-, NP-, S-, SP-, SPC- and NPC-domains were produced  with varying  \nsolubility  because they contain the whole  or only part of the N-domain, whereas SM-CRT  \n Chapter 3                                                                Expression and purification of SM-CRT                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                               \n140 \n \nP-, C- and PC-domains were expressed as completely soluble proteins with no  \nrecombinant  protein remaining in the cell pellets of the host bacteria (Figure 12). This was \nsimilar to H. contortus CRT P- and C-domains which were produced as soluble forms \n(Suchitra & Joshi 2005).  \n \nWestern blot analysis (see Figure 13) detected different SM-CRT sub-fragments which \nconfirmed the success of proteins expression in the pilot experiments that helped to \noptimize the time needed for protein expression and gave an  idea about the extent of \ndegradation of the recombinant protein with time. There was a positive correlation between \nthe time of IPTG induction and the yield of the recombinant proteins. Most of SM-CRT \nsub-fragments expressed well 2-3 hours post-induction. With longer incubation, there was \nprotein degradation with the N-, NS-, NP- and NPC-domains. As these domains all include \nthe N-domain and it seems that this portion of CRT is liable to spontaneous degradation. \nThis is consistent with the observation reported by Ferreira et al. (2004) who noticed that \nthe N-terminal part of recombinant T. cruzi CRT (TcCRT) is exposed to spontaneous \ndegradation.  Other SM-CRT sub-fragments showed increased expression correlating with \nthe incubation time without apparent degradation. It was found that P-, C- and S-domains \nrequired a longer period of incubation up to 4-5 hours.  \n \nDomains P-, C-, PC-, S-, SP- and SPC- were purified in sufficient quality by His-tag \naffinity chromatography and with addition of ion exchange chromatography, the degree of \npurity was excellent. But the segments containing the N-domain needed both the \npurification steps to attain a sufficient degree of purity and this may be due to the tertiary \nstructure of the expressed SM-CRT sub-fragments that contain the globular N-domain \n Chapter 3                                                                Expression and purification of SM-CRT                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                               \n141 \n \nwhich could bind non-specifically to BL21 E. coli proteins or because of protein dimers \nformations that occur more frequently with these sub-fragments than with P- or C- domains \n \nThe FPLC machine used for protein purifications was run with Unicorn 5.01 software. This \npurification process was safe, relatively quick, reproducible, the reagents were relatively \ncheap and the machine was easily managed after training.  \n \nVarious SM-CRT sub-fragments were analysed on Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE \ngels and shown to be slightly larger than their predicted molecular weight (see Figure 12, \n15& 17 and Table 2). The expressed NPC-domain, with predicted 47 kDa, ran at a relative \nsize of around 60 kDa in SDS-PAGE gel, and this is in agreement with other expressed \ncalreticulin of different species, such as Schistosoma species (Khalife et al. 1993, Huggins \net al. 1995, Scott& McManus 1999), N. americanus (Winter et al. 2005) and human \n(McCauliffe et al. 1990).  The dimorphic phenomenon, that SM-CRT sub-fragments run at \na molecular weight larger than the calculated molecular weight, can be explained by the \nslow run of these proteins in the gel due to their relative high acidity and this acidity may \ninterfere with their binding with SDS (Huggins et al. 1995). Also, the occurrence of CRT \npost-translational  modifications may affect  the running behaviour. \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n142 \n \n \nChapter 4 \nCharacterization of SM-CRT sub-fragments \n4.1  Results  \n4.1.1 Binding of SM-CRT sub-fragments to calcium \nThe capability of the different expressed recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments to bind \ncalcium was evaluated using  two methods; staining the proteins with \u201cStains-all\u201d stain \n(which identifies Ca\n2+\n binding proteins) and by direct calcium binding using \n45 \nCa\n2+\n. \n \nBy using \u201cStains-all\u201d stain,  P-, C-, NS-, NP-, NPC-, PC-, S-, SP-, SPC-domains and \ncalmodulin (positive control) all  gave a  blue colour staining  indicating their  ability to \nbind to calcium, whereas the SM-CRT N-domain and the negative control (BSA) stained \npink denoting that these protein are not calcium binding proteins (see Figure 18).  \n \nThese results were confirmed by evaluating the binding ability of these proteins with \nradioactive calcium. This showed that most SM-CRT sub-fragments bound \n45 \nCa\n2+ \n. The \nstrength of the signals varied amongst the proteins. The highest capacity to bind calcium \nwas seen with the C-domain. The N-domain did not give any signals, but an unexpected \nfinding was that neither NS- nor NP-domains bound calcium (Figure 19). \n \n \n \n \n \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n143 \n \n \n                           A                                                                        A* \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n \n                            B                                                                      B* \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 18: SDS-PAGE gels (15%) stained with Coomassie blue and fixed with 25% \nisopropyl alcohol (A& B) or stained with \u201cStains-all\u201d stain (A*&B*) .

It was found that the 1: 160 NHS titer achieved 70-80% haemolysis and a \n1:40 dilution of C1q deficient serum reconstituted with 0.125 \u03bcg of human C1q  achieved \n70-75% haemolysis.  \n \nSM-CRT sub-fragments and BSA were prepared in concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20 \u00b5M. \nIn the case of NHS, the proteins were mixed with 1:160 diluted serum and incubated at \n37\u00b0C for 1 hour. After that, 5% SRBCs (1x 10\n 8\n cells\/ml) was added for each well and re-\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C for further 1 hour. Then, BBS was added to each well and the plate was \ncentrifuged and 200 \u00b5l supernatant from each well was transferred to a flat bottom well and \nO.D. was read at 405 nm. In case of C1q depleted serum, the same process was used, but \nthe serum was   reconstituted with 0.125 \u00b5g human C1q and added to 100 \u00b5l of 1: 40 C1q \ndeficient serum. \n \nAddition of recombinant SM-CRT P-domain did not affect the haemolysis of the sensitized \nSRBCS and this underlines the finding that the SM-CRT P-domain does not bind to C1q.  \nAll other recombinant SM-CRT domains decreased haemolysis in a dose dependent \nmanner. The inhibitory activity on haemolysis varied among the different domains. SM-\nCRT sub-fragments effects were similar in both types of sera used, but for the reconstituted \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n148 \n \n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100 N\nP\nC\nS\nNPC\nBSA\nRecombinant SM-CRT concenteration in \u00b5M\n%\n o\nf \nN\nH\nS\n h\nae\nm\nol\nys\nis\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100 NS\nNP\nSP\nSPC\nPC\nBSA\n%\n o\nf \nN\nH\nS\n h\na\nem\no\nly\nsi\ns\nRecombinant SM-CRT concenteration in \u00b5M\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nN\nP\nC\nS\nNPC\nBSA\nRecombinant SM-CRT concenteration in \u00b5M\n%\n o\nf \nC\n1\nq\n d\nef\nic\nen\nt \nse\nru\nm\n  h\nae\nm\nol\nys\nis\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nNS\nNP\nSP\nSPC\nPC\nBSA\nRecombinant SM-CRT concenteration in \u00b5M\n%\n o\nf \nC\n1\nq\n d\nef\nic\nen\nt \nse\nru\nm\n  \nh\na\nem\no\nly\nsi\ns\nC1q deficient serum, slightly greater amounts of recombinant SM-CRT proteins were \nrequired to achieve a similar degree of  haemolysis compared to diluted  NHS (Figure 21).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 21: Inhibition of C1q dependent haemolysis assays.

At first, the specific anti-serum \nrecognised the NPC-domain in a Western blot assay of the antigen with BSA and BL21 cell \nlysate loaded as negative controls. Subsequently, anti-SM-CRT rabbit anti-serum was used \nto identify all SM-CRT fragments by Western blot. \n \nIt was found that anti-SM-CRT rabbit anti-serum reacted with all the SM-CRT fragments in \nWestern blot analysis (see Figure 22). On Western blots, there were other bands identified \nby the anti-serum in addition to the main bands of the recombinant SM-CRT fragments. \n \nELISA was also applied to test the immunogenicity of SM-CRT. At first, the NPC-domain \nwas coated on a plate and incubated with the pre-bleed and anti-serum using the following \ndilutions; 1:1000, 1:10000 and 1:50000. The anti-NPC rabbit anti-serum reacted against \nNPC-domain in different dilutions denoting the good immunogenicity of the SM-CRT NPC \nantigen (Figure 23 A). Then, different SM-CRT sub-fragments were tested with the same \nspecific anti-serum dilutions. Two plates were coated with the proteins in duplicate and \neach group received BSA as negative control and the full length NPC-domain as a positive \ncontrol. The specific anti-SM-CRT anti-serum was added at dilutions of 1:1000, 1:10000 \nand 1:50000. All SM-CRT sub-fragments gave absorbance with different dilutions of the \nspecific anti-serum with some variations (Figure 23 B& C).   \n \n \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n150 \n \nTo assess which domain was most immunogenic, O.D.s were compared at 1:10000 \ndilution. It was found that the C-domain and PC-domains were the most immunogenic \nachieving the highest O.D. value after the NPC-domain. The fragments with the lowest \nimmunogenicity were the N- and the SP-domains. Other SM-CRT sub-fragments were \nmore or less similar to each other in their degree of immunogenicity (Figure 23 D& E). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n151 \n \n                                                                                                \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      C                                                                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 22: Western blot of  recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments identified by anti-\nSM-CRT rabbit anti-serum(1:40).

Many calcium binding proteins were described in different \nstages of Schistosoma, for example Sm20 protein which is found in Schistosoma muscle \nlayer (Havercroft et al. 1991), a calmodulin\u2013like protein was recognized within adult \nparasite tegument (Siddiqui et al. 1991), in addition to other proteins ranging from 15-205 \nkDa in size  (Fuhrman 1990). \n  \nThe calcium binding ability of different recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments was \nevaluated by two methods; staining SM-CRT sub-fragments loaded on SDS-PAGE gels \nwith \u201cStains-all\u201d stain and testing the binding of the recombinant proteins separated on \nacrylamide gel to radioactive calcium. \n \nMost SM-CRT sub-fragments have the ability to bind to calcium as they stained blue with \n\u201cStains-all\u201d stain, while the N-domain band stained pink indicating that this domain does \nnot bind calcium. This point to the conclusion that the SM-CRT P- and C-domain are the \ndomains responsible for calcium binding (Figure 18). These results were in agreement with \nthose of Baksh& Michalak (1991) who tested calcium binding ability of different human \nCRT forms; native, recombinant GST fusion, non-fusion CRT or expressed C-, P-, NP- and \nPC-domains. The authors found that all these segments gave blue colour bands when \nstained with the  stain, while the N-domain stained  pink. Also,   H. contortus CRT   proved \nto bind calcium using this stain (Suchitra& Joshi 2005). \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n158 \n \n\u201cStains-all\u201d stain was used under reducing conditions and the dye interacted with the \nprotein after being run and denatured with SDS. It is an easy, simple technique which \nrequires only few reagents.  \n \nTo confirm that SM-CRT sub-fragments bind to calcium, they were incubated with \n45 \nCa\n2+\n. \nRadioactive calcium was diluted in buffer of pH 6.8, which is near the physiological \ncondition (Maruyama et al.1984) and avoids low pH that would decrease the negativity of \nthe  protein  fragments, leading to less calcium binding as it is well known that  calcium ion \nis a positively charged molecule and calreticulin especially its C-terminal part is acidic \nnegatively charged molecule. \n \nMost SM-CRT sub-fragments interacted with \n45\nCa\n2+\n and showed signals corresponding to \ntheir band, but N-, NS- and NP-domains did not show such signals (see Figure 19). Similar \nresults were observed by other researchers who tested CRT-calcium binding of other \nspecies. Calreticulin from many parasitic species bound \n45\nCa\n2+\n such as S. mansoni in a \nprevious report (Khalife et al. 1994), S. japonicum (Huggins et al. 1995, Scott& McManus \n1999) and L. donovani (Joshi et al. 1996). Recombinant full length  H. contortus CRT and \nits P- and C-domains interact with  calcium, but its N-domain does  not bind to the calcium \n(Suchitra& Joshi 2005).  Recombinant N. americanus CRT failed to bind calcium in vitro \nusing band shift electrophoresis and this may be due to an improper folding of the protein \n(Kasper et al. 2001). Different forms of human CRT bind to \n45\nCa\n2+ \n(Baksh& Michalak \n1991), but in addition to my results where SM-CRT NP-domains did not show any \n45\nCa\n2+ \nbinding in a Western blot analysis, these authors found that human NP-domain bind \ncalcium. \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n159 \n \nThe SM-CRT C-domain is rich in aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E) residues \nespecially at the last 50 residues (it contains 18 aspartic acid or glutamic acid amino acids). \nThis part is also remarkably  similar to the human counterpart (Bakash& Michalak 1991). \nThis might account for the  high capacity of this region to  bind  calcium. \n \nThe failure of SM-CRT  NS- and NP-domains to bind to  \n45 \nCa\n2+ \n, may be caused by  that \nthe P-domain (which binds to calcium in high capacity and low affinity) being masked by \nthe globular N-domain during expression.  \n \nThe radioactive overlay technique has many advantages: the nitrocellulose membrane is \neasily handled, the reagents and chemicals (except the radioactive calcium) are relatively \ncheap and stable, the time  required for incubation with the radioactive calcium is relatively \nshort and it is an efficient procedure to test specific protein binding to calcium.  \nThe successful demonstration of calcium binding to SM-CRT confirms that the \nrecombinant protein retains its function after being produced in bacterial expression \nsystem. The proven calcium binding activity of SM-CRT might suggest that native S. \nmansoni CRT can bind tcalcium in the micro-environment around the parasite in blood and \nconsume calcium which is required for blood coagulation, hence CRT may help prevent \nblood coagulation around the parasite.   \n \nSchistosoma secretes and\/ or excretes some proteins which were shown to interact and \ninactivate some complement components in order to protect the parasite from lethal \ncomplement activities. CRIT acts as a receptor for C2 and hinders production of the C3 \nconvertase, C4b2a (Inal 1999, Inal& Schifferli 2002, Inal& Sim  2000), CAA is as a \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n160 \n \nsoluble receptor for C1q (Van Dam et al. 1993) and Schistosoma paramyosin binds C1q \n(Laclette et al.1992), C8 and C9 (Deng et al. 2003& 2007).   \n \nThis is the first report addressing the interaction of S. mansoni calreticulin with the \ncomplement system. I have shown that most SM-CRT sub-fragments bound to C1q using \nphysiological PBS, while the P-domain did not. The binding was dependent on the protein \nconcentrations and occurred under physiological conditions. My experiments show a direct \nbinding of SM-CRT (except P-domain) to C1q and an inhibition of C1q-dependent \nhaemolysis. The proteins were added to two plates, as each plate could only accommodate  \nsix samples. The C1q binding affinity of different SM-CRT sub-fragments were compared \nto each other (in the presence of BSA) using C1q concentration of 0.4 \u00b5g\/well as this \nconcentration was expected to give the highest signal of binding allowing easy comparison.  \n \nWithin the  protein group  comprising  N-, P-, C-, S- and NPC-domains, the NPC-domain \nbound to C1q slightly stronger than the S-domain, followed by both N- and C-domains, \nwhich were nearly equal in binding affinity, but the P-domain did not show any binding \nsignal even  with this high C1q concentration (Figure 20 A*). \n \nIn the other group (see Figure 20 B*), NP- and SPC-domains bound with similar affinity to \nC1q, followed by NS- and PC-domains, whereas the SP-domain bound C1q with the lowest \naffinity, despite the fact that it  contains the whole S-domain. There are two explanations \nfor this observation. Firstly, SP-domain contains only one confirmed SM-CRT C1q binding \nmotif in its N-terminal part which is KEIPCKDD (this will be discussed in detail below). \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n161 \n \nSecondly, the P-domain, which is linear in shape, may mask the S-domain during \nexpression not allowing the S-domain to expose its C1q binding site and interact with C1q. \n \nTo evaluate if this binding would affect the biological function of C1q, a classical pathway \ndependent haemolysis assay was performed using NHS (normal human serum) and C1q \ndeficient serum reconstituted with purified human C1q to re-gain haemolytic activity of \nabout 70-75%. As expected, all SM-CRT domains, except the P-domain, decreased the \nreactive percentage of haemolysis with some degree of variation. In one protein group (N-, \nP-, C-, S-, NPC-domains and BSA which was tested using NHS), 10\u00b5M from each NPC-, \nN- and S-domains decreased haemolysis from 75-80% to under 10% when using NHS \ndiluted at 1:160. The C-domain required a final concentration of 20\u00b5M to reduce \nhaemolysis to 10 %, while the P-domain did not have any effect on haemolysis (see Figure \n21A). On the other plate (NS-, NP-, SP-, SPC-, PC- domains and BSA using NHS), 10 \u00b5M \nof NS- and SPC-domains decreased the haemolysis from 75-80% to less than 10% whereas \na final concentration of 20 \u00b5M of domains NP, SP and PC was required to reduce \nhaemolysis to approximately 10% (Figure 21B).   \n  \nWhen using the reconstituted human  C1q deficient serum, similar effects were seen, but \nlarger quantities of recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments were required (Figure 21 A* & \nB*). This is probably due to relatively higher amounts of calreticulin required to bind to the \nexcess free C1q molecules added to reconstitute the C1q deficient serum. Domains N, NPC \nand NS needed to be added at a final concentration of 20 \u00b5M to drop down the haemolysis \nfrom 70-75% to less than 10%. Likewise, S-, C-, SPC-, PC- and NP-domains required to be \nadded at a final concentration of 20 \u00b5M to lower the haemolysis to less than only 20%. The \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n162 \n \nSP-domain was the least potent inhibitor of C1q-dependent haemolysis inhibition. The \naddition of a final concentration of 20 \u00b5M of the SP-domain only decreased haemolysis to \napproximately 30 %.  \n \nIt was noted that N- and S-domains are the individual domains which achieved the \nstrongest binding and haemolytic inhibition of haemolysis followed by the C-domain. \nInhibition of classical pathway dependent haemolysis in NHS has shown that SM-CRT can \nbind to C1q in the C1 complex and this event is likely to happen in vivo during S. mansoni \ninfection.  \n \nMost of the previous studies with CRT were done using human CRT, while only few \nreports analysed the effects of parasite CRT. The SM-CRT P-domain did not bind to C1q \nwhich is in agreement with Kishore et al. (1997) who found that under physiological salt \nconcentration, C1q bound to human CRT N-domain, while human CRT P- and C-domains \ndid not bind C1q.  Contrasting with my results, the human CRT C-domain did not bind to \nC1q, whereas P-domain did (Stuart et al. 1996). Subsequently, when the same group \nrepeated the experiment and included the S-domain, the human CRT S-domain achieved a \nhigher percentage of relative binding activity than the human CRT P-domain, while the \nleast binding affinity was seen with the N-domain. Again, the C-domain did not bind C1q \n(Stuart et al. 1997).  \n \nNative and recombinant TcCRT and its S-domain and R-domain (which is the S-domain \nplus 20 a.a of the N-domain) were all found to  bind to C1q in vitro under a physiological \nsalt concentration and this interaction was found to be a specific, saturable and dose \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n163 \n \ndependent (Ferreira et al., 2004). In another study, its S-domain bound to C1q in an ELISA \nassay in a concentration dependent manner using physiological PBS (Aguilar et al. 2005). \n \nThe H. contortus CRT, immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose, showed binding affinity \nto C1q. When the authors tested the ability of the N-, P-, C-domains and the full length \nprotein to inhibit C1q-dependent haemolysis of sensitized SRBCs, H. contortus CRT N-\ndomain inhibited the destruction of sensitized sheep RBCs in a dose dependent manner, but \nthe P-domain had no inhibitory effect despite having two putative C1q binding sites. These \nresults are in agreement with my results, however, the SM-CRT C-domain binds to C1q \nand inhibits haemolysis, whereas, H. contortus CRT C-domain did not inhibit haemolysis \n(Suchitra& Joshi 2005).  \n \nRecombinant N. americanus CRT does not bind calcium, but it bound  to C1q immobilized \non microplates under physiological conditions in a dose dependent manner. The same \nbinding occurred when N. americanus CRT was coated on a plate. Likewise, N. americanus \nCRT inhibits C1q dependent haemolysis (Kasper et al. 2001). This is in full agreement with \nwhat I observed using the SM-CRT NPC-domain. \n \nTo explain why SM-CRT P-domain did not bind to C1q, while the SM-CRT C-domain not \nonly bound C1q, but also it inhibited its activity in the haemolytic assay, S. mansoni CRT \nC1q binding sites sequences were compared with that of other parasite CRT sequences. \nHuman CRT N-domain has  four C1q binding  sites of which,  IESKHKSDF which has \nweak C1q binding activity, DEEKDKG, KDIRCKDD which has the most potent C1q \nbinding activity and  FNYKGKN  shows only partial binding to C1q  and does not affect \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n164 \n \nhaemolysis. The human CRT P-domain has only two C1q binding sites which are \nWDERAKIDD and GEWKPRQ (Kovacs et al.1998).  N. amercanius CRT has three C1q \nbinding sites which are KDIRCKDD, FSYKGKN and VQSKHKSDY in its N-domain, \nwhile the P-domain contains WDEREYIDD and GEWKPRQ (Kasper et al. 2001).  H. \ncontortus N-domain has KDIRCKDD, FSYKGKN and VQSKHKDDY, while its P-domain \ncontains WDEREYIDD and GEWKPKQ (Suchitra& Joshi 2005). Naresha et al. (2009) \nreported further two unique binding sites in the H. contortus N-domain. \n \nS. mansoni SM-CRT protein sequencing was compared with that of human CRT to identify \nthe potential C1q binding sites in the S. mansoni protein. It was found that SM-CRT N-\ndomain contains 4 potential C1q binding sites which correspond to the human C1q binding \nsites and are as follows: KEIPCKDD (75% identity with its human counterpart), \nFNYKGKN (100% identity with its human counterpart), VQSTYNAEK (11% identity with \nits human counterpart) and DPIEDLG (42% identity with its human counterpart). Its P-\ndomain has two motifs WVDEQFIDD (44.4% identity with its human counterpart) and \nGEWTPRR (71% identity with its human counterpart) (the underlining a.a shows identity \nto the human counterpart). \n \nSM-CRT P-domain binding sites did not bind or affect C1q dependent haemolytic activity \nand this is generally in agreement with Suchitra& Joshi (2005) who found that H. contortus \nP-domain did not affect the biological activity of C1q in a C1q dependant haemolytic assay. \nThis could be a consequence of minor amino acids substitutions that inactivate these \nmotifs. \n \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n165 \n \nOn the other hand, SM-CRT C-domain bound and inhibited the classical pathway \ndependent haemolysis in contrast to most other reports. This may be due to the involvement \nof C1q binding sites.  When trying to identify similar motifs, a motif RKELPDD was \nidentified showing a degree of similarity to KEIPCKDD which is found in the SM-CRT N-\ndomain. This suspected SM-CRT C-domain new motif is in the same location as the \nKEEEEAE motif in the human sequence. This corresponding human sequence motif was \nshown to be without C1q binding activity. The human CRT motif KDIRCKDD was shown \nto be the most potent motif inhibiting of C1q dependent haemolysis (Kovacs et al., 1998) \nand my SM-CRT C1q binding motif RKELPDD could be a repeated sequence located in a \nnew site within SM-CRT C-domain causing this domain to bind C1q. In addition to this \nnewly identified sequence motif, there might be other unidentified binding sites in SM-\nCRT C-domain causing  binding to C1q. \n \nFor parasites, including Schistosoma, CRT binding to C1q may allow the parasites to \nescape from host complement attack. For TcCRT which breaks down the innate immune \nprotection of C1q, at least in the microenvironment around the extracellular parasite stages \n(Ferreira et al. 2004), and in the case of Trypanosoma, this binding might be a factor that \nfacilitates  the process of  parasite invasion into the host cells (Ogden et al. 200, Rimoldi et \nal. 1989).  I hypothesise that SM-CRT may protect the parasite from complement activation \nvia the classical pathway in its surrounding environment and in the parasitic gut by binding \nC1q and inactivation of the classical pathway of complement away from the parasite. This \nis similar to what has been reported for the S. mansoni CAA antigen which is found to be \nexcreted to the serum and is suggested to  bind to C1q in the lumen of its gut away from its \nvulnerable epithelia (van  Dam et al. 1993). Also, Schistosoma is a blood feeding parasite \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n166 \n \nand it could swallow C1q while taking its blood meal  and parasite CRT could interact with \nthe ingested C1q protecting its gut from classical pathway activation as previously \nsuggested in for  H. Contortus CRT (Naresha et al. 2009). Schistosoma could benefit from \nthe presence of  multiple C1q binding  sites where this could allow the protein to interact \nwith C1q directly at multipoint positions hence inactivate the classical pathway completely \nas suggested for H. contortus CRT (Naresha et al. 2009).  \n \nThe rabbit anti-SMCRT anti-serum, which was prepared by immunisation with the \nrecombinant SM-CRT NPC-domain, reacted not only with SM-CRT NPC-domains, but \nalso different fragments thereof in both Western blot analysis and ELISA assays. This \nconfirms the immunogenicity of my recombinantly expressed SM-CRT and this is in \nagreement with others who reported that CRT is highly immunogenic in different species \nsuch as rabbit (Aguilar et al. 2005) and human (Marcelain et al. 2000,  Aguillon et al. \n1997). \n \nUsing rabbit anti-SM-CRT anti-serum in Western blots (see Figure 22), specific reactive \nprotein bands were detected. The faint bands which appear above and below SM-CRT NP-, \nNS-, NPC-, SPC-, PC-domains might be due to the formation of proteins dimers, they \ncould also be degradation products or these faint bands are proteins derived from the host \nBL21 E. coli. In ELISA and at 1:10000 titre (Figure 23), the reactivity with  the anti-serum \nwas still detectable and it gave strong signals with the C-, PC- and SPC-domains indicating \nthat these domains may be more  immunogenic than SP- and N-domains.  \n \n Chapter 4                                                                                  Characterization  of SM-CRT  \n                                                                                                                               \n167 \n \nNative  S. mansoni CRT was identified as one of the  surface antigens of schistosomulum \nand the adult parasite preparations containing the membrane antigens using anti-SM-CRT \nspecific rabbit anti-serum. This suggests that CRT is one of the excretory\/secretory \nproducts which may perform various functions for the parasite. SM-CRT was detected in \nthe excretory\/secretory products of S. mansoni primary sporocysts (Guillou et al. 2007).  S. \nmansoni CRT was found in the tegument (Khalife et al. 1994, van Balkom et al. 2005). It \nhas also been detected using a proteomic analysis inside cisternae of tegument cell bodies \norganelles and it was suggested that it reaches the tegument through secretory vesicles \n(Braschi et al. 2006). Parasite CRT was detected in the excretory\/secretory products of H. \ncontortus (Suchitra& Joshi 2005),  it is proved to be found  on the surface of E. histolytica \nand could have  role in the pathogenesis of amoebic liver abscess (Girard-Misguih et al. \n2008) and N. americanus CRT was detected in parasite homogenates (Kasper et al. 2001). \n \n \n \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n168 \n \n \nChapter 5 \nUse of recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments and CTF in the sero-\ndiagnosis of S. mansoni \n5. 1Results \n5.1.1 Murine antibody response against SM-CRT, CTF and SEA \n5.1.1.1 Mouse groups  \nFive groups of CD1 mice were used in this study: Non-infected control mice and four \nmouse groups infected with S. mansoni (each mouse was subjected to 200 S. mansoni \ncercariae) for periods of either 12 days, 35 days, 46 days or 57-59 days (Figure 26).

To recognize the most specific fragment, SM-CRT domains were expressed \nindividually or in combination.  \n \nEach ELISA plate was coated with antigen. The standard positive reference serum was \nprepared by pooling equal volumes of sera from the 57-59 day mouse group.  One plate \nwas tested for antigen binding using the serially diluted standard positive serum starting \nwith a 1:40 dilution in duplicates in two neighbouring columns. The individual mouse sera \nwere incubated with the antigen at a dilution of 1:200 in duplicates. The ELISA plates were \nread until the OD405 of the 1:40 standard dilution reached 1-1.5 units. For each antigen, the \nspecific antibody response was evaluated by comparing O.D. readings of each mouse group \nseparately with the O.D. readings of the non-infected mouse control group and the \nstatistical significant difference was assessed using Student\u2019s unpaired t-test. \n  \nSM-CRT P-(P<0.001), C- (P<0.05), PC- (P<0.05 at sera taken 46 days after infection, then \nP<0.001 with sera taken 57-59 days after infection) and SPC-(P<0.05) domains were \nsignificantly more reactive than other SM-CRT sub-fragments and their specific antibodies \nstarted to appear in the sera 46 days post-infection.  Likewise, SM-CRT N-(P <0.01), NS-\n(P<0.001), NP-(P <0.05), S-(P <0.001), SP-(P<0.01) and NPC-(P <0.01) domains were \nidentified later by the sera of mice 57-59 days after infection.

The reading was taken when \nthe O.D. of the standard reference serum at 1: 20 dilution reached 1-1.5 units. To correct for \nvariations within the ELISA plates, the O.D. was converted to relative antibody titre. The \nstandard serum was assigned an arbitrary antibody titre of 1.0 and the titre of the samples \ncalculated from the equation of the standard curve.  \n \n5.1.2.2 The cut-off values of the antigens \nThe cut-off for each antigen was equal to mean + 2SD of the relative antibody titres of the \nsera collected from the healthy U.K. donors (21 sera). SM-CRT sub-fragments have \nrelatively high cut-off values. The SM-CRT N-domain cut-off was the highest with 0.817, \nwhile the cut-off for the SM-CRT P-domain was the lowest amongst SM-CRT with 0.399. \nCTF antigen cut-off was 0.119, which was higher than that of the SEA  (0.091)  (see Table \n5).  \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n

The highest degree of cross-reactivity \namongst the SM-CRT sub-fragments were shown by SM-CRT C- and SP-domains which  \ncross-reacted with 22 sera, for each, out from the total 53 sera collected from patients \nsuffering from different parasitic diseases plus autoimmune patients. CTF showed a lower \ndegree of cross-reactivity than SEA. CTF false positively recognized 19 patients sera, while \nSEA cross-reacted with 25 sera. \n \nAll Fasciola infected patient sera cross-react with CTF, SEA and SM-CRT C-domain. SM-\nCRT N- and SPC-domains did not cross-react with any hydatid infected patient sera, while \nSM-CRT NS-, NP- and PC-domains cross-reacted with these sera. Likewise, Toxoplasma \npatient sera did not cross-react with CTF or the SM-CRT PC-domain, while 1 Toxoplasma \npatient serum cross-reacted with the SM-CRT N-, NP-, NPC-, S- and SPC-domains. In \ncontrast, SEA cross-reacted with 3 of the 5 tested Toxoplasma  infected patient sera.  \n \nWhen testing autoimmune patients sera on an ELISA plate coated with recombinant human \nCRT, four out of 15 sera from patients with autoimmune disease were positive for auto-\nantibodies against human CRT (see Figure 32).  \n \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n188 \n \nU\n.K\n. c\non\ntr\nol\ns\nA\nut\noi\nm\nm\nun\ne\n0.1\n1\n10\n   \n   \n  A\nn\nti\nb\nod\ny \nti\nte\nr\nThe highest degree of cross-reactivity with autoimmune sera was shown with the N-\nterminal part (including full length protein) of SM-CRT where NS-, NP-, NPC-domains \nidentified falsely 5 autoimmune patient sera.  However, SM-CRT PC- and C-domains \nshowed the least degree of cross-reactivity with the autoimmune sera, where they cross-\nreacted with only two sera (the sera 5 and 14 which shown auto-antibodies).  The SM-CRT \nP-domain did not cross-react with any of the autoimmune patient sera. The SEA antigen \nshowed a lower cross-reactivity with autoimmune patient sera (cross-reactivity with 1 \nserum) than CTF (which was positive in 4 autoimmune patient sera) (Table 8). There were \n7 sera out of these 15 autoimmune sera (46.7%) which did not cross-react with any of the \nSM-CRT sub-fragments.

The main reasons for choosing S. mansoni CRT as a potential \ndiagnostic antigen is that it is well established that parasite CRT has a high degree of \nimmunogenicity and the detection of specific anti-CRT antibodies in patients suffering \nfrom other parasitic diseases, such as O. volvulus (Lux et al. 1992), T. cruzi (Marcelain et \nal. 2000) and E. histolytica (Gonzalez et al. 2000& 2002).  T. cruzi CRT and T. brucei CRT   \nhave been used with promising results for the diagnosis of Chagas\u2019 disease and sleeping \nsickness through detecting of CRT specific antibodies with ELISA assay in South \nAmerican and sub-Sahara African patients  (Marcelain et al. 2000,  Schwaeble& Lynch \n2007, Prof. Schwaeble, personal communication). \n \nCTF is  schistosomula supernatant which contains the soluble materials which are  released \nby the ceracariae after being mechanically transformed to schistosomula in vitro (Colley& \nWikel 1974). This preparation has not far been widely used for sero-diagnosis of \nschistosomisis. To my knowledge, the work presented in this thesis shows for the first time \nan evaluation of the CTF antigen in an endemic Egyptian cohort of sera.  The efficiency of \nCTF and SM-CRT sub-fragments were compared to that of SEA. The latter was chosen \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n194 \n \nbecause it is well known to be more sensitive and specific than SWAP (McLaren et al. \n1978, Mott& Dixon 1982, Sorgho et al. 2005).  \n \nAt first, the reactivity of the antigens were tested in the mice which were experimentally \ninfected with S. mansoni and blood samples taken and analysed at different time points \nafter infection. Specific antibodies against the N-terminal part of SM-CRT (NS-, NP-, S-, \nSP-domains and  full length protein, NPC-domain) appeared later where the antibody titre \nelevated significantly in the sera of mice 57-59 days p.i. (see Figure 27). The late \nappearance of specific antibodies against these SM-CRT sub-fragments may be due to the \nlow immunogenicity of SM-CRT N-domain or due to the low amount of native SM-CRT \navailable to the immune system during early Schistosoma infection. The finding of a low \nimmunogenicity of the N-domain is supported by my previous finding that rabbit anti-SM-\nCRT anti-serum was less reactive to the N-domain (Figure 23)  and this is in agreement \nwith Rokeach et al. (1994) who studied the immunogenicity of different recombinant O. \nvolvulus CRT segments in patients suffering from the oncocercosis. These authors reported \nthat, the protein segment A (spans from 1-99 a.a position) and segment B (spans from 100-\n167 a.a position) (which correspond to the SM-CRT N-domain) reacted weakly with these \npatients sera.  \n \nHowever, the specific antibodies against the C-terminal domains of SM-CRT (P-,C- and \nPC-) and SPC-domain start to appear in the sera of infected mice at 46 days after  infection \nstarting with the onset of adult development (Figure 27).  This could be attributed to \nseveral reasons. First, the P-, C- and PC-domains do not include the less antigenic N-\ndomain, but the SPC-domain (which includes a considerable fragment of the N-domain) is \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n195 \n \nstill identified earlier because its main bulk is formed of  P-domain plus C-domain. Second, \nit seems that P- and C-domains were highly immunogenic to a degree that the amount of \nthe native CRT shed from the parasite was sufficient to induce significant levels of specific \nantibodies in the mice during S. mansoni infection. Third, the C-domain potentially \ninvolves a site for N-linked glycosylation (Michalak et al. 1999) hence; it could be a \nglycoprotein antigen that induce relative early production of specific antibodies. Despite the \npossibility that the glycosylated C-domain of the parasite CRT induces a good response \nagainst the carbohydrate components of that glycoprotein, but these anti-glycostructure \nspecific antibodies do not bind to the recombinant non-glycosylated SM-CRT C-domain \nused for my antibody detection assay.  It is well established that there are good anti-\nSchistosoma  antibody response, especially after the egg production, mainly towards the \nparasitic glycan  antigens (Doenhoff et al. 2004).   \n \nWhen human CRT N- and C-domains interact with calcium or zinc, they become more \nsusceptible to proteolysis (Corbett et al. 2000) and this may also be the case for SM-CRT, \nwhere the degradation of extra-cellular SM-CRT C-domain in the in vivo environment \nmight be accelerated by the binding of ions and this makes the C-domain accessible at an \nearly stage to antigen presenting cells, hence elicits antibodies at earlier stage compared to \nN-domain which appears to be less immunogenic. \n \nThis behaviour of SM-CRT was similar to that previously described for recombinant O. \nvolvolus CRT (Rokeach et al. 1994). It was found that specific antibodies were directed \nprimarily against the central (C segment, which spans from 167-248 a.a. position and \nnearly corresponds to the SM-CRT P-domain) and its terminal carboxyl (D segment which \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n196 \n \nspans from 248-374 a.a. position  and corresponds to the SM-CRT C-domain). The day 12 \np.i. and day 35 p.i.  mouse groups were not sero-reactive to  any SM-CRT sub-fragment. \nThis might be because the protein is highly expressed at the adult stage and in eggs when \ncompared to relative lower levels of expression in the newly transformed schistosomula \n(Khalife et al. 1994).  However, CTF was recognized by sera from infected mice at day 12 \np.i. onwards. The unexpected early antibody response to CTF implies the early mounting of \nspecific antibody response against cercariae.  \n \nSEA behaved like CTF. An explanation for detection of anti-SEA in mice sera as early as \n12 days p.i. is offered by a recent proteomic study which shows that SEA includes antigens \nwhich are expressed at every stage of Schistosoma life cycle. Notably SM-CRT is a minor \nconstituent of SEA (Mathieson& Wilson 2010). However, this was in contrast with many \nreports which studied the time points from which a significant anti-SEA antibody response \nwas seen in experimental mice ranging from 3-13 weeks post infection. Anti-SEA \nantibodies were detectable in mouse sera as early as 3 weeks after infection with 60 (+\/-10) \nS. mansoni cercariae (Helmy 2007), highly  specific antibodies were recognized from 4 \nweeks post-infection onwards  in BALB\/c mice infected with 25 cercariae only (Makarova \net al. 2003). In another study, anti-SEA antibodies were detectable in sera of S. mansoni  \ninfected ICR mice (with 200 cercariae) by ELISA assay six weeks p.i. (Suzuki et al. 2006). \nAnti-SEA specific antibodies were detected in sera of inbred CBA\/H mice infected with S. \nmansoni at 35 days post-infection by the ELISA, while in the same study using  immune-\nelectrophoresis, the anti-SEA antibodies were only detectable at 42 days p.i. with showing \nstrong precipitation  at the very late time point of 13 weeks after infection (Dunne et \nal.1984).  \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n197 \n \nS. mansoni infected human sera were collected from Northern Nile delta  Egypt, where S. \nmansoni is prevalent. I used sera from healthy U.K. donors which have never been exposed \nto Schitosoma to calculate the cut-off for detection of each antigen, as it is otherwise \ndifficult to identify individuals who are truly Schistosoma negative in endemic regions \n(DeVlas& Grysels 1992,  Polman et al. 2000). \n \nCut-off values, which were expressed in relative antibody titre, were relatively high for \ndifferent SM-CRT sub-fragments (Table 5) reaching its highest level for the N-domain \nwith 0.817 and the lowest was for the P-domain with 0.399. The general increase of the cut-\noff of SM-CRT sub-fragments could due to the presence of cross reacting anti-human CRT \nantibodies found in the normal individuals. The difference in the cut-off of different \nfragments could be due to the difference in the antigenicity of the different domains.  \n \nThe C-terminal part (P-,C- and PC-domain) of SM-CRT gave the best sensitivity among \ndifferent SM-CRT sub-fragments (Table 7). The PC-domain was the most informative SM-\nCRT-sub-fragment and recognized 69 of 97 sera of S. mansoni patients (71.1%), P-domain \nreacted with 64 of 97 sera (66%) and the C-domain reacted with 59 of 97 positive patient \nsera (60.8%).  \n \nAmongst the calreticulin domains, its C-terminal part is the least conserved domain \n(Michalak et al. 1999) with the SM-CRT C-domain showing only 38% identity with its \nhuman counterpart (Table 3). This might explain its relative high sensitivity, which was \nalso observed for the PC-domain. In addition, the sensitivity of these domains may also be \nrelated to their relatively high immunogenicity. This explanation is also supported by the \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n198 \n \nresults of my immunogenicity study in mice. This hypothesis is also supported by a \nprevious study analysing O. volvulus CRT which showed high reactivity of sera with \ncentral and carboxyl parts of recombinant O. volvulus CRT. In my study, however, the SM-\nCRT  PC-domain which showed stronger reactivity  than  C- and P-domains on their own, \nwhile the recombinant CD fragment  (central and carboxyl) of O. Volvulus CRT was less \nreactive than either sub-fragments separately (Rokeach et al. 1994).  \n \nSM-CRT sub-fragments containing the N-domain shown lower sensitivity with the worst \nsensitivity was for the NP-domain detecting only 35.1% of infected sera (34 of 97 sera \ntested) (Table 6). The lower sensitivity of the SM-CRT NP-domain in comparison to the \nSM-CRT P-domain might be due to the fact that the P-domain is somewhat hidden in the \nNP-domain fragment, as a result of recombinant expression in a prokaryotic system.  \n \nIn my hands, the recombinant SM-CRT NPC-domain achieved a sensitivity of 50.5% (49 \nout of 97 tested sera), that was lower than that reported for the complete purified SM-CRT \nantigen used by Khalife et al. (1993) (87.5% sensitivity). They analysed recombinant SM-\nCRT in presence or absence of the fusion partner GST for reactivity only with few children \nsera (8 total) who were infected with S. mansoni, from an endemic area in Kenya, Africa. \nReactivity was analysed on Western blots and by ELISA. The higher sensitivity in their \nstudy might be explained by the fact that the children are serologically more reactive to \nsome Schistosoma antigens such as SEA (Tanabe et al. 1990,  Naus et al. 2003).  \n \n \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n199 \n \nSM-CRT revealed a lower sensitivity than TcCRT for the detection of T. cruzi infection \nwhich produced excellent results for the sero-diagnosis of Chagas\u2019 disease (Prof. \nSchwaeble, personal communications) and this may be attributed to several factors. SM-\nCRT may not be immunogenic enough to induce sufficient specific antibodies in humans \ninfected by Schistosoma, whereas Trypanosoma does, SM-CRT may be not become \navailable to immune system in sufficient quantities during the course of Schistosoma \ninfection and SM-CRT specific antibodies levels may decrease during chronic infection. \n \nThe SEA ELISA, in my hands, achieved a sensitivity of up to 89.7% which is slightly \nbetter than that shown in some other reports. The sensitivity was 86 % in a non-endemic \narea in Venezuela, South America (de Noya et al.,1992), or 72% sensitivity in patients \npassing Schistosoma eggs, examined in another  U.K. laboratory analysing sera from \nimmigrants and Europeans returning from Africa during the period of 1993-1997 (Whitty et \nal. 2000). The SEA-ELISA sensitivity was 79% in infected sera taken from a community \nwith low transmission in Venezuela (Spencer et al. 1991).  On the other hand, the \nsensitivity of SEA ELISA reported in this study is slightly lower than previous reports.  \nTanabe et al. (1990) reported that SEA ELISA sensitivity was up to 98% in an endemic \narea. The SEA ELISA yielded a sensitivity of 94% for a large population in an endemic S. \nmansoni area in Kenya (Doenhoff et al. 1993). In Venezuela, SEA ELISA sensitivity was \ncompared and reached the same sensitivity of stool sample and approached 98% (Alarcon \nde Noya et al. 1997). In a study analysing patients from an endemic area in Brazil, there \nwere 98.8% of stool egg positive patients showing anti-SEA specific antibodies (Santos et \nal. 2000). In an endemic area in Africa, the SEA ELISA achieved 95.8% sensitivity in \ncohort of sera collected from patients of different age categories (Sorgho et al. 2005). \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n200 \n \nThe difference in the sensitivity of SEA ELISA among various studies can be attributed to \nmany factors. i) Whether the infected persons were living in endemic S. mansoni areas or \nwere just tourists, as the latter patient category usually reveal better sensitivity of the \nserological Schistosoma tests (van Gool et al. 2002). ii) The prevalence rate of Schistosoma \ninfection in the locality and the severity of Schistosoma  infection in individuals (Hamilton \net al. 1998,  Doenhoff et al. 2004). iii) Age of the patients as the immune response against \nSchistosoma antigens changes with the age, for example, the immune response  against \nSEA decreases with increasing the age of patients (Naus et al. 2003, Van Dam et al. 1996, \nWebster et al. 1997). iv) PZ administration also affects the anti-Schistosoma immune \nresponse by exposing new Schistosoma antigens to the host immune system after the drug \nkills adult worms (Viana et al. 1995, Correa-Oliveira et al. 2000,  Mutapi 2001) and by \neliminating the immune hypo-responsiveness caused by the adults (Feldmeier et al. 1988). \nv) The variations in the assays procedures include the use of different types of negative \ncontrol sera and whether or not the infected persons are living in or outside Schistosoma \nendemic areas. vi) Finally, the performance of the same serological diagnostic test might \nsignificantly differ amongst sera of infected blood donors in different areas (van Lieshout et \nal. 2000). \n \nCTF antigen gave the highest sensitivity in this study (89.7%) which was similar to that \nrevealed with SEA ELISA. The CTF ELISA reacted with 87 sera from the 97 sera collected \nfrom S. mansoni infected patients. There were 81 out of 97 patient sera which were positive \nfor both  SEA and CTF antigens and 93.1% of SEA positive sera were positive for CTF \n(which produces a sensitivity of 93.1% in these sera). Nearly similar results were reported \nby Chand et al. (2010), the only previous report on this antigen, who found that the CFT \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n201 \n \nELISA achieved 99.2% sensitivity in SEA ELISA positive sera. The slight difference in \nsensitivity between my study and Chand et al. (2010) might be due to the type of the \npatients, who were in my study persons living in endemic area, while in the other study, \nthey analysed sera from infected European tourists. \n  \nThere was correlation between the antibody response to both CTF and SEA. This is in \nagreement with Chand et al. (2010), who reported such correlation between O.D.s of both \nantigens. This correlation in antibody titres of both antigens could be due to the fact that, \nmost of the produced antibodies are directed against glycoproteins which are shared \nbetween cercariae and eggs (Wuhrer et al. 1999).  \n \nThere were 4 S. mansoni infected patient sera which were not positive with either SEA or \nCTF ELISAs. It cannot be excluded that these S. mansoni infected patient sera were \nimproperly handled for example, by keeping the sera for longer periods exposed to room \ntemperature before freezing. \n \nA group of 53 sera from patients (S. mansoni negative) with either other parasitic infection \n(14 Ascaris, 13  Entamoeba histolytica, 3 Fasciola, 3 echinococcosis and 5 Toxoplasma) or \nestablished autoimmune diseases (15 sera) were used to test for cross-reactivity against \nother diseases. The SM-CRT N-domain was shown to give the highest degree of specificity \nfor schistosomiasis by cross-reacting with only 9 sera out of 53 S. mansoni negative sera, \nwhile SM-CRT SP- and C-domains showed the highest degree of reactions showing \nreactivity in 22 of these 53 S. mansoni negative sera.  CTF showed less cross-reactivity \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n202 \n \nthan SEA in this cohort of patient sera. CTF cross-reacted with 19 of 53 patient sera, \nwhereas SEA cross-reacted with 25 of these 53 patient sera (Table 8).  \n \nAll the Fasciola sera of infected patients (3) were falsely positive with CTF, SEA and the \nSM-CRT C-domain antigens. The other SM-CRT sub-fragments did not react with any of \nthese sera. The Fasciola patients reacted more strongly with SEA than with CTF as shown \nby the relative antibody titre. It was observed that the N-terminal part of SM-CRT did not \ncross react with Fasciola positive sera. Unfortunately, Fasciola CRT sequences has not yet \nbeen characterized to compare amino acids identity. In the cases of CTF and SEA, there \nmay be cross-reactive antigens in Schistosoma and Fasciola. The cross-reactions between \nother parasitic antigens for Schistosoma and Fasciola were reported in many previous \nreports (Rodriguez-perez& Hillyer 1995, Hillyer 1981&1985, Aronstein et al. 1985a& b, \nAlarcon de Noya et al. 1996).  \n \nIn the cases of hydatid patients (3), the recombinant N-domain antigen did not cross react \nwith any patients sera, but a high cross-reactivity between hydatid antigens was seen with \nrecombinant SM-CRT  NS-, NP- and PC-domains (containing P-domain). The SMCRT N-\ndomain alone seems to have a high degree of specificity with low cross reactivity with \nhydatid associated antigens. CTF showed cross reactivity with one of the three hydatid sera, \nwhile SEA was positive with two of the 3 sera tested. The highest degree of amino acid \nidentity  between SM-CRT  and CRT of Echinococcus is located in the P-domain with \n64%, while SM-CRT N-domain has 54% identity with N-domain of   Echinococcus (Table \n3) . Cross-reactivity between hydatide and Schistosoma was reported previously (Lacllette \net al. 199,  Sulahian et al. 2005). \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n203 \n \nThe SM-CRT N-domain showed cross-reactivity with only 1 out of 14 sera from patient \nsuffering from Ascaris.  CTF cross-reacted with 6 out of the 14 Ascaris sera. The highest \ndegree of cross-reactivity was seen with SEA which was positive in 9 out of these 14 sera. \nSM-CRT N-domain showed a higher degree of specificity in identifying Schistosoma \ninfection in Ascaris patient sera than CTF or SEA. I speculate that Ascaris CRT carboxyl \npart is highly immunogenic and elicit antibodies in the sera of affected patients which \ncross-react with the counterpart SM-CRT. Also, a high degree of amino acid identity  \nbetween SM-CRT  and CRT of Ascaris could be located in the P-domain. At present, there \nis unfortunately no published sequence information available for Ascaris CRT. Cross-\nreactivity of other Ascaris and Schistosoma antigens has been reported previously  \n(Sulahian et al. 2005, Correa-Oliveira et al. 1988, Pritchard et al. 1991).  \n \nIn sera of patients infected  with E. histolytica (13 sera), the S- and the SPC-domains cross-\nreacted with only 2 sera out of 13, the N-domain recognized 3 sera of this cohort and  SM-\nCRT P-domain showed the highest degree of cross-reactivity with 8 out of 13 sera being \npositive. CTF reacted with 8 out of 13 E. histolytica infected sera while SEA reacted with 9 \nout of these 13 sera. The carboxyl portion of SM-CRT showed the highest degree of \nreactivity  with E. histolytica antigens and this  might be due to a high degree of identity in \nsequences between both parasite CRTs which would explain  their high cross  reactivity. \nThe  degree of amino acids identity  between SM-CRT P-domain  and CRT P-domain of E. \nhistolytica is 66%. I speculate that E. histolytica CRT carboxyl part is highly immunogenic \nand elicit antibodies in the sera of affected patients which can cross-react with the \ncounterpart SM-CRT. The specific anti-E. histolytica CRT antibodies were generated \nduring the course of invasive amoebiasis.  Gonzalez et al. (2000& 2002) reported that in \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n204 \n \n91% of patients with invasive amoebiasis, E. histolytica CRT specific antibodies are \npresent  in their serum and saliva and  the antibody level  decreased  by about 70% 6-12 \nmonths after treatment. These antibodies did cross-react with SM-CRT. \n \nMost of the antigens used in this assay showed low cross-reactivity with   toxoplasmosis (5 \nsera). The SM-CRT PC-domain and CTF did not cross-react with any of the 5 Toxoplasma \npatients sera. SM-CRT P-, NS-, SP- and C-domains cross-reacted with 2 of the 5 \ntoxoplasma patients sera. Generally speaking, the cross-reactivity of the different SM-CRT \nsub-fragments with Toxoplasma antigens was low and a good specificity could be achieved. \nThis may be attributed to a lower degree of homology between both S. mansoni and \nToxoplasma CRT (although at present, no sequence information for Toxoplasma CRT is \navailable). Toxoplasma CRT appears to be less immunogenic as only insufficient quantities \nof specific antibodies against Toxoplasma CRT were present to cross-react with highly \nhomology  S. mansoni CRT.  It could also be that the Toxoplasma CRT does not shed from \nthis parasite in sufficient quantities to elicit an effective immune response. CTF shows a \nbetter degree of specificity with none of these 5 sera being positive in the CTF ELISA, \nwhile 3 out of the 5 Toxoplasma patient sera were positive in the SEA ELISA.    \n \nThere were 4 sera from the 15 autoimmune patients sera which gave positive readings with \nrecombinant human CRT on ELISA. When testing the cross-reactivity of sera collected \nfrom autoimmune patients against SM-CRT sub-fragments on ELISA, it was observed that \n7 auto-immune sera out of these 15 (46.7%) did not cross-react with any SM-CRT sub-\nfragment.  The carboxy-terminal part of SM-CRT (PC- and C-domains) showed the least \ndegree  of   cross-reactivity   with  the   autoimmune  sera,  where  none  of  these  15  sera  \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n205 \n \ncross-reacted with the SM-CRT P-domain and the SM-CRT PC- and C-domains cross-\nreacted with only two sera (which shown to have auto-antibodies against human CRT).  \n \n It was interesting to find that the SM-CRT P-domain did not cross-react with any of the  \nautoimmune sera, despite the fact that  it has 62% identity with its human counterpart and \nthe  human P-domain has auto-antigenic epitopes which are able to induce auto-antibodies \nin some autoimmune diseases (Boehm et al. 1994, Routsias et al. 1993, Kishore et al. 1997, \nSontheimer et al. 1991). The lower degree of cross-reactivity of PC- and C-domains with \nautoimmune sera might attributed to that the SM-CRT C-domain has only 38 % identity in \namino acids with the human C-domain.  \n \nThe highest degree of cross-reactivity with autoimmune sera was revealed for the N-\nterminal part of SM-CRT (N-, S-, NS-, NP-, SP-, NPC-domains, containing N-domain or \npart of it) where all of these recombinant antigens gave 5 positive readings.  This could be \nattributed to the fact that  i) the N-terminal part of human CRT includes auto-antigenic \nepitopes which can induce auto-antibodies in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases \nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis and SLE (Boehm et al., 1994, Kishore et al., 1997,  Sontheimer \net al., 1991,  Routsias et al., 1993). This may in part explain the cross- reactivity with the \nautoimmune sera which were shown to have auto antibodies against human CRT,   ii)  the \namino acid identity between the N-domain of SM-CRT and human CRT is 53%, and  iii) \nthat  human CRT is a major component of cytolytic T-cells (Dupuis et al. 1993) and  during  \nparasitic infections, through the activation of the cytolytic T-cells, larger amounts of human \nCRT are released and may account for a higher concentrations of auto-antibodies which in \nturn may cross react with SM-CRT.   \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n206 \n \nThe SM-CRT NPC-domain cross-reacted with 5 (three of them have auto-antibodies \nagainst human CRT) out of the 15 autoimmune sera (33.3%). This degree of cross-\nreactivity was  lower than  that shown by a previous report in which 50% of European SLE \npatients sera cross-reacted with  S. mansoni CRT being tested by Western blot or  by the  \nELISA assay (Khalife et al. 1993).       \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \nSEA cross-reacted with only 1 autoimmune serum, while CTF showed cross-reactivity with \n4 patients sera out of 15 suffering from autoimmune diseases. However, none of these \ncross-reacting autoimmune sera, with SEA or CTF, showed  auto-antibodies against human \nCRT by ELISA.   \n \nCollectively, the SM-CRT N-domain achieved the least cross-reactivity degree (cross-\nreacted with 5 from the 38 sera collected from patients suffering from parasitic disease) \nthan the SM-CRT C-terminal parts (P-, PC- and C-domain which cross-reacted with 20, 19 \nand 20 sera respectively). Three main explanations were addressed to explain this finding. \nFirst, the identity between SM-CRT and these parasites CRTs may be mainly in the P-\ndomain of the CRT. Second, the CRT P- and C-domain are more immunogenic  than the  \nN-domain, therefore  both P- and C-domains can generate a higher antibody response \nwhich during the parasitic infection, hence these generated parasites anti-CRT antibodies \nmay cross -react with the recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments expressed from its central \nand carboxyl parts. Third, the cut-off limit for SM-CRT N-domain ELISA was very high, \nlargely due to the presence of a significant amounts of anti-SM-CRT N-domain in the \ncontrol sera, in other words, the specificity for N-domain was high and its sensitivity was \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n207 \n \nlow because the controls and patients alike had relatively high anti-SM-CRT N-domain \nantibody. \n \nIn total, The SM-CRT N-domain showed the least degree of cross reactivity with patients \nsera infected by the parasitic disease or suffering from autoimmune disease where it reacted \nwith 9 sera out of these 53 (16.9%)  patients.  The CTF antigen cross-reacted with 19 sera \nout of 53 sera of patients suffering from parasitic or autoimmune disease (30.2%)  and it \nachieved a lower degree of cross-reactivity than did SEA which falsely recognized 25 sera \nout of these 53 sera (47.2%) suggesting that CTF lacks epitopes responsible for cross-\nreactivity in SEA.  This was slightly different about what reported by Chand et al. (2010) \nwho found that CTF identified 16 sera out of 74 patients sera suffering from different \nparasitic disease and hepatitis B virus  (21.6%)  while 10 sera out of these 74 sera  (13.5%) \nwere reacted with SEA.  \n \nWith analysis of the 21 sera from healthy U.K.  donors as the \u201cS. mansoni  negative control \ngroup\u201d, the specificity was 100 % with the SM-CRT NPC-, C- and PC-domains, while a \nspecificity of  95.2% was seen for other SM-CRT sub-fragments. Likewise, CTF revealed \n100% specificity and compared to SEA (which achieved a specificity of 95.2%) appeared \nmore reliable.  When the cohort including the 19 sera from healthy Egyptian individuals \nwas included in the specificity study, I observed an increased the number for sera which \ngave cross-reactions with the different S. mansoni antigens used. For this cohort, the SM-\nCRT N-domain revealed by far the highest degree of specificity with 94.7%, whereas the \nSM-CRT P-domain achieved the lowest degree of specificity with 42.1% amongst SM-\n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n208 \n \nCRT sub-fragments. SEA revealed the lowest degree of specificity in this study with \n26.3%, but CTF showed a higher specificity with 68.4% (see Table 9).  \n \nIn my study, the SEA ELISA specificity was 95.2% for the \u201cS. mansoni  negative group\u201d of \nsera collected from healthy U.K. donors. This is in agreement with previously published \nstudies, the SEA ELISA achieved variable specificity results such as 100% in a non-\nendemic area (Tanabe et al. 1990), while another study achieved a specificity of 98.2% for \nthe SEA ELISA. This study analysed sera of S. mansoni infected Europeans which \ncontracted infection whilst being abroad and the negative control group included various \ncohorts of sera from patients suffering from bacterial, viral, parasitic or autoimmune \ndiseases (van Gool et al. 2002). \n \n Likewise, the specificity of the SEA ELISA was only 26.3 % when the \u201cS. mansoni \nnegative group\u201d was formed out of 19 sera of healthy Egyptian donors. This is in \nagreement with other studies performed in endemic areas. The SEA ELISA  specificity  \nwas lower than  20% in an endemic area in Africa  (Doenhoff et al. 1993). In another recent \nstudy in an endemic Schistosoma area in Africa, the specificity of the SEA ELISA was \nlower than 30% (Sorgho et al. 2005). \n \nThere is  straightforward trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (Doenhoff et al. 1993 \nand results presented here). This illustrates a general problem with the use of antibody \ndetection assay in endemic areas, whether the antigen is SEA, SM-CRT and CTF or the \npreviously popular S. mansoni adult worm antigen (SWAP).  \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n209 \n \nThere are many factors that could explain why the individuals previously diagnosed as \nnegative for  S. mansoni infection using the  stool examination method gave false positive \nreactions with SM-CRT, CTF and SEA in the ELISA. i) Low sensitivity of stool \nexamination (Doenhoff et al. 2004),  so some patient sera that were collected from Egypt, \nmight be from individuals that have harboured S. mansoni infection with a very low \nparasites load, where the eggs cannot be seen using microscopic analysis of stool. ii) The \ndevelopment of mainly adult male (unisexual infection) Schistosoma where no egg \ndeposition can be found in stool (Oliveira et al. 2005, Doenhoff et al. 2004). iii) Anti-\nSchistosoma specific antibodies may persist for months or even years, despite a successful \nelimination of the infection (Doenhoff et al. 1989). iv) Schistosoma infection might not \nhave been completely eliminated by chemotherapy and the infection may still continue with \nonly few eggs being secreted which are not detectable microscopically (Doenhoff 1998). v) \nThe presence of cross-reacting antibodies, which are generated against certain antigen \nepitopes  found  in other parasites such as  Fasciola and Ascaris  could be responsible for \nthe false positive readings with some of the Schistosoma antigens (Correa-Oliveira et al. \n1988& 2002, Alarcon de Noya et al.1996, Aronstein et al.1986, Hanna &Hillyer 1984 and  \nSulahian et al. 2005). For example, Sm14 and tropomyosin are cross-reacting antigens with \na high degree of homology between Schistosoma and Fasciola (Hillyer 1995). Some SM-\nCRT sub-fragments could be incorrectly folded and expose new epitopes that may be \nidentified with cross reacting antibodies.  \n \nIn conclusion, the ideal test required for the sero-diagnosis of Schistosoma infection should \ncover the following certain criteria. It should be simple, the reagents should be cheap and \nstable, the test should be reproducible, interpretation of the results should be easy and it \n Chapter 5                                                                                  Sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \n                                                                                                                               \n210 \n \nshould be of satisfactory sensitivity and specificity (Hoshino-Shimizu et al.1992,  Rabello \net al. 1997,Turner et al. 2004). Most of these criteria were covered more or less by CTF \nand the SM-CRT antigens PC-, P and C-domains. Some SM-CRT sub-fragments gave \nrelatively good results, especially the PC-domain (71.13% sensitivity), the P-domain \n(65.97% sensitivity) and the C-domain (60.82% sensitivity). Using SM-CRT in the sero-\ndiagnosis of Schistosoma has certain advantages. The use of recombinant Schistosoma \nantigens in the serological assays avoids cross-reactivity to a large extent. In addition to \nachieving a sensitivity equal to that of SEA (89.7%), CTF antigen is ideal as it is a quick \nand cheap to produce.  Large amounts could be prepared from the schistosomulum and only \nfew mice are needed to generate considerable amounts of the antigen.  \n \n Chapter 6                                                                                    Immunisation with SM-CRT \n                                                                                                                               \n211 \n \n \nChapter 6 \n \nUse of recombinant SM-CRT in vaccination of mice against S. mansoni \ninfection \n  \n6.1 Results \n6.1.1 Testing immunogenicity of the recombinant full length His-tagged SM-CRT in \nBALB\/c mouse \nA preliminary experiment was done to evaluate the immunogenicity of the recombinant full \nlength SM-CRT in BALB\/c mouse strain given prior to them being infected with S. \nmansoni cercariae. Two mouse groups (4 mice in each group) were established. Each \nmouse in the immunised group received intra-peritoneally three doses of recombinant SM-\nCRT protein in two weekly intervals; the first dose was 50 \u00b5g SM-CRT and other two \ndoses were 25 \u00b5g, all doses were mixed with equal volumes of alum adjuvant (total volume \nwas 100 \u00b5l \/dose). The control mouse group received PBS\/alum at the same points of time \nparallel to that of the immunised group. In addition to the pre-bleed (time point 0), serum of \neach control or immunised mouse was collected 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the first \nimmunisation. \n \nThe SM-CRT specific antibodies (whole IgG fraction) were measured in the sera collected \nfrom both mouse groups at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the first immunisation by ELISA \nassays.

The severity of infection was assessed using the following \ncriteria; the recovered adult worms, eggs in liver and eggs\/ worm pair numbers in each \nmouse. The mean of these measures was calculated for each mouse group (one mouse died \nin the control group during the course of the infection).  \n \nThe mean % protection in the vaccinated (V) mouse group was compared to the mean of \nthe control (C) group with following formula:  \n  \nmean of  worms recovered from (C) group - mean of worms recovered from (V) group x 100 \n                                  mean of worms recovered from  (C) group \n \nThe mouse group immunised with recombinant His-tagged SM-CRT showed a mean \nreduction of 49.9% in the number of adults worms which gives a statistically significant \ndifference (P=0.03) to the non-immunised control group. However, when looking at the \nnumbers of eggs in liver tissue (41.8% lower than the control group), no statistical \nsignificance could be detectable between immunised and non-immunised mice. It was \nfound that recombinant SM-CRT achieved mean reduction of 10% in fecundity (eggs\/ \nworm pair) in comparison to the mouse group given PBS\/alum and this difference is not \nstatistically difference. It seems that SM-CRT immunisation did not cause any further anti-\nfecundity effect (Table10 and Figure 36). \n \n \n \n Chapter 6                                                                                    Immunisation with SM-CRT \n                                                                                                                               \n215 \n \n \nTable 10: Worm burden, tissue eggs and eggs\/worm pair numbers in immunised and \ncontrol groups (mean \u00b1 SD).

Some individuals in endemic  Schistosoma areas  manifest \nvarious degrees of natural resistance against  the parasitic infection (Butterworth et al. \n1985& 1988& 1994, Hagan et al. 1991) and some anti-parasitic vaccines have been \nsuccessfully developed such as Echinococcus granulosus and Taenia ovis (Dalton& \nMulcahy 2001). \n \nSM-CRT appears to provide a potentially effective anti-Schistosoma vaccine antigen due to \na number of reasons: i) SM-CRT is present in the tegument of larva and adult Schistosoma \n(van Balkom et al. 2005, Braschi et al. 2006, Khalife et al. 1994 and this study), so that it is \npresent at the parasite\/ host interface. ii) In this study my recombinant SM-CRT binds and \ninhibits the biological function of the C1q molecule in vitro, therefore SM-CRT \nneutralization in vivo may expose Schistosoma to complement attack. iii) SM-CRT is \nidentified by T-cell and B-cell of the Schistosoma infected mice and rabbits (El Gengehi et \nal. 2000).  \n \n \n \n \n \n Chapter 6                                                                                    Immunisation with SM-CRT \n                                                                                                                               \n219 \n \nUntil now, there is no published report that assessed  the efficacy of recombinant or native \nSM-CRT in the protection against experimental S. mansoni infection in animals. My work \nis the first study to evaluate the protective efficacy of recombinant SM-CRT against \nSchistosoma infection in experimental animal models of infection.  \n \nThe preliminary experiment which was performed to evaluate immunogenicity of the \nrecombinant full length His-tag SM-CRT in BALB\/c mic, showed that the immunised \nmouse group produced specific SM-CTRT antibodies as early as 2 weeks after \nimmunisation with recombinant SM-CRT. The antibody levels increased after further \nboosting doses (as assessed by ELISA) (see Figure 34 A). The immunised mouse sera (at 6 \nweeks after first immunisation) reacted with the antigen at a titre of 1:50000 (Figure 34B). \nThis implies that SM-CRT produced strong immune response in BALB\/c mouse strain. \nSubsequently, a challenging experiment was established. When analysing sera two weeks \nafter each immunisation, the sera of the immunised mouse group showed antibody response \nprofiles similar to those seen in the preliminary experiment (Figure 35 A& B).  \n \nThe detection of specific SM-CRT antibodies in both immunisation experiments indicates \nthe immunogenicity of the recombinant SM-CRT in BALB\/c mouse strain and this is in \nagreement with the previously shown immunogenicity of my expressed recombinant SM-\nCRT in rabbit (see Figure 22& 23). It is interesting to observe that despite the fact that \nCRT is a highly conserved protein among different organisms, SM-CRT was able to induce \na remarkable antibody response in the mice immunised with the protein. This is in line with \nsimilar observation for other CRT species like TcCRT (Aguilar et al. 2005).  \n Chapter 6                                                                                    Immunisation with SM-CRT \n                                                                                                                               \n220 \n \nRecombinant SM-CRT achieved a 49.9% reduction in Schistosoma adult worm numbers \nwith a statistically significant difference (P=0.03) when compared to the control group \n(Table 10 &Figure 36). This percentage of protection is good when compared to other \nSchistosoma antigens which were tested in experimental mouse model of Schistosoma \ninfection. For example, recombinant caplin caused 29-39% protection (Hota-Mitchell et \nal.1997), Sm23-pcDNA reduced the worm burden up to 36-44% (Da\u2019dara et al. 2003), \nrSm14 showed protection of 36.9-49.5% (Ribeiro et al. 2002) and recombinant \nSchistosoma 14-3-3 protein achieved protection of 25-43% (Schechtman et al. 2001).   \n \n By achieving the 49.9% reduction in adult worm numbers, SM-CRT fulfils an important \nanti-Schistosoma vaccine criterion suggested by WHO. WHO indicates that the antigen, \nwhich cause 40% reduction in the adult worms in the mouse model, is a promising vaccine \nantigen. To reduce morbidity and mortality in humans, it is most important that such a \nvaccine gives a relative reduction of the parasitic load, as this determines the severity of \npathology. So, even a vaccine that gives not 100% of protection, but reduces the severity of \nparasitic disease by reducing the numbers of parasites following infection is highly \nvaluable as it reduces the morbidity and mortality of Schistosoma (Bergquist& Colley \n1998). \n \nConcerning liver eggs counting, the immunised mouse group showed a mean reduction of \n41.8% in comparison to the control group, but the difference between both groups was \nstatistically insignificant (p value = 0.22) and this is could be due to the wide SD of  the \nimmunised groups (eggs number in the immunised group was 25780 \u00b1 22393.5) (Table \n10), as it shown that, there was a varied individual protection from 14.7-80.4% compared to \n Chapter 6                                                                                    Immunisation with SM-CRT \n                                                                                                                               \n221 \n \nthe mean of the worm adult of the control mouse group.  However, SM-CRT did not show \nfurther anti-fecundity effect (Table 10), where the count of eggs per worm pair of the \nimmunised group was reduced with only 10% with insignificant difference in comparison \nto the control mouse group.  \n \nTo explain the protective effect of recombinant SM-CRT, I measured IgG sub-classes in \nthe sera of both mouse groups (control and immunised group) two weeks after the third \ninjections. The measurement of IgG1 and IgG2a are indicators for Th2 and Th1 immune \nprofiles type responses (Martin& Lew 1998). It was found that, in comparison to the \ncontrol mouse group, the immunised mouse group sera had significantly higher antibody \nlevels of both IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies (Figure 37). However, the immunised mouse \ngroup sera showed that IgG1 levels was significantly higher than IgG2a (p value= 0.0004). \nThe IgG1:IgG2a ratio in the sera of the immunised mouse group was 2.4 (measured by \ndividing the mean of O.D. readings of IgG1 by O.D. readings of IgG2a). This shows that \nthe protective immune response generated with recombinant SM-CRT was a mixed \nTh1\/Th2 response with a predominant Th2 immune response profile. The alum adjuvant \ncombined with recombinant SM-CRT may be partly responsible for this immune response \nprofile. My SM-CRT study is therefore in the line with other mouse vaccination trails \nwhere aluminium hydroxide was used as adjuvant and shifted the immune response \npredominantly towards Th2 immune response profile (Yip et al. 1999, Grun et al. 1989). \n \nI concluded that the SM-CRT specific antibodies generated during vaccination helped to \nneutralise or kill the invading S. mansoni cercariae in immunised mice. These SM-CRT \nspecific antibodies are likely to bind to the surface of cercariae where SM-CRT is exposed \n Chapter 6                                                                                    Immunisation with SM-CRT \n                                                                                                                               \n222 \n \nand may alter calcium binding capacity of parasitic CRT which in turn may affect muscle \ncontractions and the signalling functions of calcium and thereby hinder the migration of \ncercariae. The specific SM-CRT antibodies may inhibit C1q binding function of SM-CRT \nand this would let the larvae exposed to the lethal effects of complement activation via the \nclassical pathway.  In addition to that, immunisation with recombinant SM-CRT may \ntrigger Th1 cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 which in turn will \nactivate local macrophages (in lung and skin) to kill invading larvae (Reynolds et al. 1990, \nMounteford et al. 1992, Smythies et al. 1992). IFN-\u03b3 may also help with the elimination of \nparasites from the lung through the induction of adhesion molecule on epithelial cells and \nhinder schistosomulum migration (Wilson et al. 1996).  \n \nPrevious works describe protective immune responses against Schistosoma of the Th1 type \n(Smythies et al. 1993,   Zhang et al. 2001, Farias et al. 2010 ) and others of the Th2 \n(Grzych et al. 1991, Pearce et al. 1991). However, a mixed Th1\/Th2 appears to provide \nmaximal protection against experimental Schistosoma infection in mice involving both \ncellular and humoral immune responses (Jankovic et al. 1999, Hoffmann et al. 2000, \nCaulada-Benedetti et al. 1991, Wynn& Hoffmann 2000).  \n \nTwo previous reports tested the protective phenotype of S. japonicium CRT immunisation \nusing a nucleic acid based vaccination approach. In one report, S. japonicium CRT cDNA \ncloned into the pCDNA (the expression vector) failed to induce specific antibodies \nresponse in the immunised mice (Waine et al. 1997). The authors did not test the cloned S. \njaponicium CRT construct\u2019s ability to express protein in vitro and the cause of failure in \ngeneration of specific antibodies upon mouse injection may be attributed to a technical \n Chapter 6                                                                                    Immunisation with SM-CRT \n                                                                                                                               \n223 \n \nfailure of the cloning vector. In another study, S. japonicum CRT-DNA did not show any \nprotection against experimental S. japonicum infection, however, there was damage to \nexternal membranes of the adult S. japonicium tegument, (which were obtained from the \nimmunised mouse group) shown by electron microscope examination (Scott 1998). The \nfailure to induce protection may have been due to the failure of the CRT-DNA expression \nconstruct to generate sufficient recombinant S. japonicum CRT which in turn failed to \ninduce high specific antibody titres to cause protection against the challenging cercariae. \nOn the other hand, CRT from S. japonicium may be not very immunogenic. \n  \nWinter et al. (2005) tested recombinant hookworm CRT in a BALB\/c mouse model using \nthe recombinant hookworm CRT dissolved in PBS or encapsulated in poly-lactide-\ncoglycolide microparticles (PLG). It was found that the immunisation with parasite CRT \n(dissolved in PBS) reduced the number of adult hookworms in the immunised mouse group \nby 43-49% when compared to the control group, even in the absence of any adjuvant. \nAdministration of  recombinant hookworm CRT without using PLG achieved protection, \ndespite the fact that no specific IgE could be found and the degree of eosinophilia and total \nIgE was lower than in the other immunised mouse group where PLG have been used  \n(Winter et al. 2005). \n \nIn conclusion, my SM-CRT immunisation experiment showed that recombinant SM-CRT \nis an effective and promising vaccine antigen. It should be further tested  in future vaccine \nstudies using larger numbers of mice and possibly different types of adjuvants. The \nprotective immune response induced by recombinant SM-CRT deserve to be investigated in \nmore details.  \n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n224 \n \nChapter 7 \nSummary  \nIn my thesis I fully achieved the goals of my project, which assessed the use of \nrecombinant S. mansoni calreticulin, a highly immunogenic parasitic antigen in the \ndiagnosis of and vaccination against S. mansoni.  i) I expressed 10 SM-CRT sub-fragments \nrepresenting individual domains or combinations, thereof. ii) I characterised the \nphysiological function of SM-CRT sub-fragments in terms of calcium binding activity and \ntheir interaction with C1q (the recognition subcomponent of the classical pathway of \ncomplement).  iii) I evaluated the use of different SM-CRT sub-fragments and another \nparasite antigen called CTF (cercarial transformation fluid antigen) in the sero-diagnosis of \nS. mansoni infection in murine and human sera using an ELISA-based detection of specific \nantibodies, iv) and finally, I assessed the efficacy of the recombinant full length SM-CRT \nin the protection against experimental S. mansoni infection in an animal model.  \n  \nI split SM-CRT into ten sub-fragments which were N-, P-, C-, NS-, NP-, NPC-, S-, SP-, \nSPC- and PC-domains. A cDNA library of adult S. mansoni was used to amplify the coding \ncDNA sequences for these segments using PCR. The different coding regions for these sub-\nfragments were cloned and expressed using the pRSETB vector transformed to E. coli \nBL21 (DE3) pLysS host. \n \nSM-CRT N-domain was expressed mainly in soluble form, but E. coli host pellets \ncontained some insoluble protein. The SM-CRT NS-, NP-, S-, SP-, SPC- and NPC-domains \nwere produced  with varying  solubility  because they contain the whole  or a part  of the N-\n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n225 \n \ndomain, whereas SM-CRT  P-, C- and PC-domains were expressed as completely soluble \nproteins.  \n \nThe different fragments were expressed with 6 His-tag N-terminal fusion to facilitate the \nprocess of protein purification. The proteins were purified using affinity chromatography \nwith HiTrap Ni Chelating HP columns (using linear gradient elution using buffer \ncontaining 5-500 mM imidazole), then the proteins were further purified by ion exchange \nusing  HiTap Q HP  column  (using  linear gradient elution  with buffer containing 20 mM-\n1 M  NaCl).   \n \nCalcium binding capacity of the recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments was evaluated by \ntwo methods; \u201cStains-all\u201d staining of the protein loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel  or by the  \ninteraction with the radioactive calcium binding to the recombinant proteins separated on a \nnon-denaturing PAGE and blotted  to nitrocellulose membrane Western blot assay.  With \nthe exception of the N-domain, all  SM-CRT sub-fragments showed the ability to bind \ncalcium when stained blue with \u201cStains-all\u201d stain. On incubation with 45Ca2+, most SM-\nCRT sub-fragments bound \n45\nCa\n2+\n, however N-, NS- and NP- domains did not. The failure \nof SM-CRT NS- and NP-domains to bind \n45 \nCa\n2+ \n, may be because the P-domain (which \nbinds to calcium in high capacity and low affinity) is masked by the globular N-domain in \nNS- and NP-domains.  \n \nThe proven calcium binding activity of SM-CRT might suggest that native S. mansoni  \nCRT can bind to calcium in the micro-environment around the parasite in blood  and \n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n226 \n \nconsume calcium which is required for blood coagulation, hence CRT may help to limit \nblood agglutination around the parasite.   \n \nI tested the interaction of SM-CRT sub-fragments with C1q in vitro. It was shown that, all \nSM-CRT sub-fragments (except the SM-CRT P-domain) bound to C1q using physiological \nPBS and that binding was dose dependent.  It was found that, all SM-CRT sub-fragments \n(except P-domain) inhibited the C1q dependent haemolysis not only using normal human \nserum but also using the reconstituted C1q deficient serum. I observed that SM-CRT N- \nand S-domains are the individual domains which achieved the strongest binding with C1q \nand inhibition of C1q dependent haemolysis.  \n \nIn trying to explain why SM-CRT P-domain did not bind to C1q, while the SM-CRT C-\ndomain not only bound C1q, but also inhibited its activity in the haemolytic assay (which \nwas in contrast to most of previous reports on CRT), S. mansoni CRT C1q binding sites \nsequences were compared with that of human and other parasite CRT sequences. I observed \nthat the SM-CRT C-domain has a suspected C1q motif binding site, in addition to the \npresence of other unidentified C1q motifs. On the other site, the SM-CRT P-domain C1q \nbinding sites seem to be functionless.  I hypothesise that SM-CRT may protect Schistosoma \nin vivo from complement activation via the classical pathway in its surrounding \nenvironment and in the parasitic gut by binding C1q and inactivating the classical pathway \nof complement.  \n \nMy recombinant full length SM-CRT protein (NPC-domain) showed high immunogenicity \nwhen immunising a rabbit. The rabbit anti-SM-CRT anti-serum reacted with different \n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n227 \n \nrecombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments in both Western blot analysis and ELISA assays.  \nThis specific anti-SM-CRT identified the native S. mansoni CRT in the surface \npreparations of  schistosomulum and the adult parasite using.   \n \nThe third goal of my project was to evaluate the use of different SM-CRT sub-fragments \nand CTF (cercarial transformation fluid) antigen in the sero-diagnosis of S. mansoni \ninfection in experimental mice and humans using an ELISA-based detection of specific \nantibodies. The work presented in this thesis shows for the first time an evaluation of both \nantigens in an endemic Egyptian cohort of sera. The efficiency of CTF and SM-CRT sub-\nfragments were compared to that of SEA.  \n \nSpecific antibodies against the carboxy-terminal part of SM-CRT (P- and C-domain) \nappeared at 46 p.i. days in S. mansoni infected mouse sera,  while the specific antibodies \nagainst the N-terminal part of SM-CRT became detectable only  57-59 days after infection. \nThis suggests the high immunogenicity of the carboxy-terminal part of the protein. CTF \nand SEA were recognised by sera of S. mansoni infected mice as early as 12 day p.i.. The \nunexpectedly early antibody response to CTF implies the early mounting of specific \nantibody response against cercariae.   \n \nS. mansoni infected sera (n=97) were recruited from the Northern Nile Delta, Egypt, while  \nI used sera from healthy U.K. donors (which have never been exposed to Schistosoma) to \ncalculate the cut-off limit  for the detection of each antigen. The carboxy-terminal part of \nSM-CRT gave the best sensitivity amongst different SM-CRT sub-fragments. The PC-\ndomain was the most informative SM-CRT-sub-fragment showing a sensitivity of 71.1%, \n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n228 \n \nthe P-domain revealed 66% and the C-domain produced a sensitivity of 60.8%.  It seems \nthat SM-CRT (which does not contain the N-domain) reacts strongly with specific \nantibodies and the antibodies generated against SM-CRT during the course of \nschistosomiasis are directed mainly against its central and terminal parts. \n \n For the other recombinant SM-CRT sub-fragments, I observed an unsatisfactory low \ndegree of sensitivity with very low sensitivity of detection for the NP-domain detecting \nonly 35.1% of S. mansoni infected sera. However, CTF showed 89.7% sensitivity which \nwas equal to sensitivity of the SEA ELISA. CTF achieved a sensitivity of 93.1% in the S. \nmansoni infected sera which gave positive readings with SEA ELISA.  I found a correlation \nbetween the antibody response to CTF and SEA. \n \nI tested the cross-reactivity of the antigens against a cohort of 53 sera drawn from patients \nsuffering from other diseases  including either other parasitic infection (14 Ascaris, 13  \nEntamoeba histolytica, 3 Fasciola, 3 echinococcosis and 5 Toxoplasma) or established \nautoimmune diseases (15 sera).  All of these control sera are Schistosoma egg -Ve.  The \nSM-CRT N-domain showed the highest degree of specificity for schistosomiais by cross-\nreacting with only 9 sera out of 53 S. mansoni negative sera, while SM-CRT SP- and C-\ndomains showed the highest degree of cross-reactions showing reactivity with 22 sera of \nthese 53 S. mansoni negative sera. CTF showed less cross-reactivity than SEA in this \ncohort of patients sera. CTF cross-reacted with 19 sera, whereas SEA cross-reacted with 25 \nof these 53 patients sera. It was interesting to find that SM-CRT P-domain did not cross-\nreact with any of the tested autoimmune sera, despite the fact that the P-domain of SM-\nCRT has 62% identity with its human counterpart.  \n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n229 \n \nWhen using the 21 sera from healthy U.K. donors as the \u201cS. mansoni negative control \ngroup\u201d, CTF and SM-CRT NPC-, C- and PC-domains achieved 100% specificity, while a \nspecificity of 95.2% was seen for SEA with similar specificity seen for the other SM-CRT \nsub-fragments. When the cohort including the 19 sera collected from healthy Egyptian \nindividuals was used  for the specificity study,  the SM-CRT N-domain revealed by far the \nhighest degree of specificity with 94.7%, whereas the SM-CRT P-domain achieved the \nlowest degree of specificity with 42.1% amongst the SM-CRT sub-fragments. SEA \nrevealed the lowest degree of specificity in this study with only 26.3%, while CTF showed \na specificity of 68.4%.   \n \nMy fourth goal was to test the protective effect of recombinant SM-CRT against \nexperimental Schistosoma infection.  My work is the first study to evaluate the protective \nefficacy of recombinant SM-CRT against Schistosoma infection in experimental animal \nmodels of infection. In my study, the recombinant SM-CRT produced strong immune \nresponse in the immunised BALB\/c mouse strain. It is interesting to observe that despite \nthe fact that CRT is a highly conserved protein among different organisms, SM-CRT was \nable to induce a remarkable antibody response in the mice immunised with this protein.   \n \nIn my study, recombinant SM-CRT achieved a 49.9% reduction in Schistosoma adult worm \nnumbers with a statistically significant difference (P=0.03) when compared to the non-\nimmunised control mouse group. By achieving this percentage of reduction in adult worm \nnumbers, SM-CRT fulfils an important anti-Schistosoma vaccine criterion set out by the \nWHO. The WHO states that an antigen, which can cause a 40 % reduction in the adult \nworms numbers in a mouse model of infection is a promising vaccine antigens as it will \n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n230 \n \ncause a valuable reduction of morbidity and  mortality caused by Schistosoma infection \n(Bergquist and Colley, 1998). \n \nIn correlation with the reduction of adult Schistosoma numbers, the eggs numbers in the \nliver tissues decreased by 41.8% in the immunised mice when compared to the control \nmouse group, however, the difference was not statistically significant due the wide SD \nwithin the immunised groups (egg numbers was 25780 \u00b1 22393.5). This was attributed to \nthe variation in individual mouse protection which ranged from 14.7 to 80.4% compared to \nthe mean of the adult worm numbers of the control mouse group.  However, SM-CRT did \nnot show further anti-fecundity effect.  \n \nOn dissecting the immune response in the immunised mouse group, I found that the \nimmunised mice responded against SM-CRT by producing specific IgG1 and IgG2a \nsubclasses with ratio of 2.4. The IgG subclasses reflected that the immunised mice showed \nTh1\/Th2 with a predominate Th2 immune response profile and this profile appeared to \ncause the maximal protection against experimental Schistosoma infection in mice as \nsuggested in other reports (Jankovic et al. 1999, Hoffmann et al. 2000, Caulada-Benedetti \net al. 1991,  Wynn& Hoffmann 2000).  \n \nI speculated that the SM-CRT specific antibodies generated during vaccination may kill the \ninvading S. mansoni cercariae in SM-CRT immunised mice. These SM-CRT specific \nantibodies are likely to bind the exposed SM-CRT on surface of cercariae and may alter the \ncalcium binding capacity of the parasitic CRT which in turn may affect muscle contractions \nand the signalling functions of calcium. All these consequences could hinder the migration \n Chapter 7                                                                                                               Summary \n                                                                                                                               \n231 \n \nof cercariae. In addition to that, the specific SM-CRT antibodies may inhibit C1q binding \nfunction of SM-CRT and this would allow the larvae to be exposed to the lethal effects of \ncomplement activation via the classical pathway. Also, in response to SM-CRT \nimmunisation a prevalent Th1 response profile may be triggered to secrete IFN-\u03b3 cytokine \nwhich have important roles in killing the invading larvae.  \n \nIn conclusion,  i) the SM-CRT P- and C-domain are the domains responsible for calcium \nbinding activity of SM-CRT, ii) all SM-CRT sub-fragments (except the SM-CRT P-\ndomain) bound to C1q and inhibited the C1q dependent haemolysis, iii) CTF shows better \nperformance in sero-diagnosis of Schistosoma infection in endemic areas than SEA and \ngives similar results in non endemic areas. This suggests that the CTF antigen (which is a \nquick and cheap to produce) can replace the expensive SEA.  Also, SM-CRT PC-domain \nachieved a sensitivity of 71.13% with specificities of 57.9% in Egyptian controls  and  iv) \nthe immunisation experiment  using recombinant full length SM-CRT showed that this \nantigen is an effective and promising vaccine candidate  as it caused 49.9% of reduction in \nSchistosoma adult worm numbers.  \n \n \n Chapter 8                                                                                                                Refrences  \n                                                                                                                               \n232 \n \n \nChapter 8 \nRefrences \nAbath,F.G., Gomes, A.L., Melo, F.L., Barbosa, C.S. and Werkhauser, R.P., 2006. \nMolecular approaches for the detection of Schistosoma mansoni: possible applications in \nthe detection of snail infection, monitoring of transmission sites, and diagnosis of human \ninfection.
