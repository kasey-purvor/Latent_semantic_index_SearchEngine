INTRODUCTION\nThe quest for improving the system capacity is a never\nending research subject in mobile wireless communication.\nIn this paper, we focus on the maximization of the user\ncapacity, defined as the maximum number of admissible users.\nFurthermore, the system of interest is the symbol-synchronous\nuncoded CDMA systems with equal-power and equal-rate\nusers and the transmission is over the AWGN channel.\nLet N and K be the processing gain and the number of\nactive users, respectively. The soft-limit of user capacity in this\nkind of system is equal to N . However, when the bandwidth\nis at premium, e.g. the system described in [1], the need to go\nbeyond that soft-limit is imminent. This condition is known\nas overloaded condition, defined when K > N .\nSignal demodulation in overloaded condition for the system\nof interest is a major challenge as there exist rank-deficiency\nof the spreading signatures matrix of the system and, hence,\northogonalization of the signatures is impossible. From the\nliterature, this problem can be tackled by utilizing an advanced\nsignal processing in the receiver side and optimizing the\nspreading signatures in the transmitter side.\nOn the receiver side, MUD techniques can be used to\ndemodulate the transmitted signal perturbed by noise. From\nthe literature, optimum MUD techniques yield the best perfor-\nmance in terms of the achievable probability of error [2], yet\ntheir computational complexity is intractable for practical im-\nplementation. Therefore, the attention has been shifted towards\nsub-optimum MUD techniques. Moreover, the popular linear\nMUD techniques (see [3] for detailed treatment), e.g. linear\nMinimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE), perform poorly in\noverloaded condition [4] due to its rank deficiency of the\nsignature covariance matrix. However, recently, by feeding\nback the recently estimated symbols\u2019 soft values, SLi SISO\nMUD techniques that meet MMSE criteria have been shown\nto achieve a substantial improvement for uncoded CDMA\nsystems [5].\nFurthermore, on the transmitter side, signature optimization\ncan also be used to improve the system performance. The\noptimum signature for overloaded condition is the signature\nthat meets the Welch-Bound-Equality (WBE), devised in [6].\nThe design and performance of the complex-valued WBE\nsequences can be found in [7]. However, WBE-sequences\nsuffer from scalability1 problems, because they are designed\nfor specific (N,K) systems. Another interesting signature op-\ntimization is the family of hierarchy of orthogonal sequences\n(HOS) that uses multiple orthogonal sequences to support\noverloaded condition [8].\nMost recently, a Low-Density Signature (LDS) structure\ncomplemented with the sub-optimum CLi SISO MUD tech-\nniques has been proposed in [9]. The idea of LDS is to\nmodify the interference pattern per chip by switching-off a\nlarge number of signature chips such that the optimum MUD\ncan be approximated by using sub-optimum Message Passing\nAlgorithm (MPA). Instead of optimizing the signature values,\na different strategy in approximating the optimum MUD is\ntaken by modifying the signature structure. By doing this, the\nscalability will not be a major problem in the system.\nThe contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we compare\n1The scalability is one of the more important aspects in wireless commu-\nnication in order to obtain a reliable and flexible system without having to\ncompromise the signalling overhead each time a connection is terminated.\n397\n1-4244-0977-2\/07\/$25.00 c\u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In addition, by utilizing LDS structure,\nCLi SISO MUD techniques are added for comparison. Second,\nwe investigate the performance of the Max-Log-MAP version\nof the CLi SISO MUD with the LDS structure. The sensitivity\nof the various CLi SISO MUD techniques to the existence of\nshort-cycles, which is known for having a bias effect for MPA,\nin the corresponding factor-graph of the LDS structure is also\ninvestigated. The Bit-Error Rate (BER) and the convergence\nbehavior are be used as the performance metrics.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section\nII presents the system model used throughout this paper. Both\nthe SLi and CLi SISO MUD techniques are introduced and\nexplained in Section III. The simulation results are given in\nSection IV and Section V concludes this paper.\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nConsider a symbol-synchronous uncoded (N,K) CDMA\nsystem for uplink transmission over AWGN channel. Let xk\nand Xk be, respectively, the transmitted symbol with period\nof Ts and the constellation alphabet for user k. Without loss\nof generality and for notation brevity, all users are assumed\nto take their symbol from the same normalized constellation\nalphabet, i.e. Xk = X,\u2200k = 1, . . . ,K with unit average\nenergy. The received signal can be written as\ny(t) =\nK\u2211\nk=1\nsk(t)e\nj\u03b8k(t)Akxk(t) + \u03bd(t); 0 \u2264 t < Ts (1)\nwhere sk(t), Ak, and \u03b8k(t) represent, respectively, the spread-\ning signature, the gain, and the user-specific phase2 for user\nk = 1, . . . ,K at time instant t. The thermal noise at the\nreceiver is represented by \u03bd(t) \u223c CN (0, \u03c32). Assuming a\nperfect synchronization, we can rewrite (1) in its discrete form\nas follows.\ny =\nK\u2211\nk=1\nhkxk + v (2)\n= Hx + v (3)\nwhere y = [y0, . . . , yN\u22121]T , hk = [hk,0, . . . , hk,N\u22121]T and\nv = [v0, . . . , vN\u22121]\nT are the received signal, the effective\nsignature for user k and the noise vectors of size N , re-\nspectively, which are formed by stacking N successive chips\ntogether. Furthermore, matrix H = [h1 . . .hK ] represents the\neffective signature of all users in the system, where the n-\nth component of the effective signature for user k is given\nby hk,n = Akej\u03b8k(t)sk,n. The most recently proposed LDS\nstructure works by switching-off a large number of spreading\nchips. Let dv \u0006 N be the maximum number of non-zero\nelements in user\u2019s signature or the effective processing gain.\nAfter spreading, a user-unique interleaver is used to randomize\n2The phase is assumed randomly distributed. This phase information is\ncommon for practical system implementation and, for this paper, is important\nfor system analysis.\n\\\nModulation\nMapper\nModulation\nMapper\n\u0002\nIterated\nSISO MUD\nModulation\nMapper\nKE\u02c6\n1\nE\u02c6\nkE\u02c6\nZero-PaddingSpreading Interleaving\n1\n\u0002\nLDS Spreading\n1\nZero-PaddingSpreading Interleaving\nk\u0002\nLDS Spreading\nZero-PaddingSpreading Interleaving\nK\u0002\nLDS Spreading\nb1\nbk\nbK\nk\nK\nx1\nxk\nxK\ndv\ndv\ndv\nN-dv\nN-dv\nN-dv\n1\nk\nK\n1\n\u0003j\ne\nK\nj\ne\n\u0003\nk\nj\ne\n\u0003\nFig. 1.

Consequently,\nthe number of interfering users per chip is now dc \u0006 K. Let\n\u03ben and \u03b6k be the set of users participating in chip n and the set\nof chips, over which user k spreads their symbol, respectively.\nThen, with LDS structure, the received signal sampled at chip\nn is given by\nyn =\n\u2211\nk\u2208\u03ben\nhk,nxk + \u03bdn (4)\n= hT[n]x\n[n] + \u03bdn (5)\nwhere h[n] and x[n] denote a vector comprising effective\nsignature components and the symbols of all interfering users\nin n-th chip.\nIII. ITERATED SISO MUD TECHNIQUES\nA. Symbol-Level Detection\nThe SLi SISO MUD can be implemented either successively\nor in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, the performance\ncomparison for these two implementations has not been yet\navailable in the literature, let alone for the overloaded con-\ndition. In this paper, we use the same approach as in [10]\nto construct the MMSE-based SLi SISO MUD and, for com-\npleteness, it is described as follows. The prior probabilities,\nwhich are computed either from initial assumption or from\nthe previous iteration stage, are used to compute the soft-\nestimates (i.e. the mean value) of the user k symbol, denoted\nas x\u02dck =\n\u2211\nxk\u2208X\nxkP (xk). Then, the following vectors can be\nformed.\nx\u02dc =\n[\nx\u02dc1 . . . x\u02dcK\n]T\nx\u02dck = x\u02dc\u2212 x\u02dckek (6)\nwhere ek denotes the all-zero vector but its k-th component\nhas value of one. In order to remove the interference using\nthe soft-estimates above, soft interference cancellation (IC) is\nmade such that\ny\u02dck = y \u2212Hx\u02dck (7)\n398 2007 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT 2007)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 15,2010 at 15:18:33 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nwhere y\u02dck represents the vector of received signal with some\neffect of the interferers are removed. To further remove the\nresidual interference that might still exist, linear filter, f\u02dck, is\nused such that E\n[\u2016xk \u2212 f\u02dcHk y\u02dck\u20162\n]\ncan be minimized.\nzk = f\u02dc\nH\nk y\u02dck. (8)\nAssuming that the residual noise and interference from linear\nMMSE detector can be approximated with a Gaussian distri-\nbution3, the estimated symbol zk can be written as\nzk = \u03bckxk + \u03b7k; \u03b7k \u223c CN (0, v2k). (9)\nFrom (9), the symbol probabilities of xk can be calculated\nas\nP (x\u02c6k) \u221d exp\n(\n\u2212 1\n2v2k\n\u2016zk \u2212 \u03bckxk\u20162\n)\n. (10)\nFor parallel MMSE-based SLi SISO MUD technique, at j-\nth iteration, the estimated posterior probability P (x\u02c6k) will not\nbe used to calculate (7)-(10) for user k+1. However, if serial\nMMSE-based SLi SISO MUD is used, the probabilities of\nuser k will be updated with the newly estimated values and\nwill be used for estimating the next user k + 1. Note that the\ndomino effect normally seen in successive processing will not\nbe as detrimental as when the hard-values are used for serial\nprocessing. However, to have a fair comparison, the users\nare sorted prior the computation by using the user ordering\nalgorithm proposed in [12]. The drawback with MMSE-based\nSLi SISO MUD techniques, either with parallel or serial\nstructure, is that the linear MMSE filter f\u02dck, which includes an\ninversion matrix of size K\u00d7K, needs to be updated for every\nuser, every iteration and every symbol. In AWGN channel, this\ncomputation, assuming that the inverse of signature covariance\nmatrix is a priori provided, can be done recursively via Matrix\nInversion Lemma as highlighted in [10]. Nevertheless, for a\nlarge K, this computation could be expensive.\nB. Chip-Level Detection\nGraphical models such as Factor Graph (interested reader\ncan refer to the excellent review about factor graph in [13]\nand references therein) allow an easy implementation and\nanalysis of many iterative processing techniques, e.g. iterative\njoint detection\/decoding techniques have been derived from an\nappropriate factor graph in [14], [15].\nDenote G(U , C) as the underlying factor graph of un-coded\n(N , K) CDMA systems, where the users (k=1,. . . ,K) and the\nchips (n=1,. . . , N) are represented by variable nodes u \u2208 U\nand function nodes c \u2208 C, respectively. An edge e(k, n) exists\nif the received chip yn contains the symbol from user k and\nis shown as a line connecting variable node uk and function\nnode cn.\nFollowing the aforementioned description, the factor graph\nof the conventional CDMA structure is illustrated as a forest-\nlike, where each variable node is connected to all function\n3We acknowledge, however, that the noise and residual MAI can be\nwell approximated by using Gaussian Distribution in the first iteration [11].\nTherefore this assumption is biased when used for iterated SISO MUD.\nnodes. This fact makes the implementation of MPA on the\nfactor-graph inefficient for uncoded CDMA systems.\nMost recently, an LDS structure has been proposed in [9]\nand, due to the sparse nature of its factor graph, LDS structure\nallows an effective implementation of the MPA. Consequently,\na new CLi SISO MUD can be designed. However, it is\nworth mentioning that, even though MAP can approximate\nthe optimum MAP detection, the posterior probability of the\nMPA-based CLi SISO MUD, due to the existence of short\ncycles, can only approach its exact value.\nThe generic form of CLi SISO MUD can explained as\nfollow. Let Ljn\u2193(xk) and Ljn\u2191(xk) be the messages4 sent along\nedge en,k, at j-th iteration, from variable node uk to function\nnode cn and vice-versa, respectively. Assuming there is no a\npriori probabilities available, the initial messages (j = 0) are\nset to zeros: L0n\u2193(xk) = 0,\u2200k,\u2200n. The messages are updated\nusing the following rules:\nLjn\u2193(xk) =\n\u2211\nm\u2208\u03bek\\n\nLj\u22121m\u2191 (xk) (11)\nLjn\u2191(xk) = F\n(\nxk|yn,Ljn\u2193(xl),\u2200l \u2208 \u03b6k \\ k\n)\n(12)\nIt can be easily seen from (11) and (12) that all messages are\nrestricted to consist of only the extrinsic information [13].\nIn order to approximate the optimum MAP (or Log-MAP\nas the messages are represented in their logarithmic-values)\ndetector, as derived in [9], the function in (12) must calculate\nthe local marginalization and can be written as\nF( \u2022 ) = log\n( \u2211\nx\n[n]\n\u2208Xdc\nxk\npj(yn|x[n])\n\u220f\nl\u2208\u03ben\\k\nP jn(xl)\n)\n(13)\nwhere\npj(yn|x[n]) \u221d exp\n(\u2212 1\n(2\u03c32)\n\u2016yn \u2212 hT[n]x[n]\u20162\n) (14)\nP jn(xl) = exp\n(Ljn\u2193(xl)\n)\n. (15)\nCombining (14) and (15) into (13), the message update is given\nby\nLjn\u2191(xk) = \u03ban,k max\u0004\nx\n[n]\n\u2208Xdc\nxk\n( \u2211\nl\u2208\u03ben\\k\nLjn\u2193(xl)\u2212\n1\n2\u03c32\n\u2016yn\u2212hT[n]x[n]\u20162\n)\n(16)\nwhere \u03ban,k denotes the normalization5 coefficient and\nmax\u0004 = log\n(\nea + eb\n)\n= max(a, b) + ln\n(\n1 + exp(\u2212|a\u2212 b|2))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u03c2\n(17)\nis the numerically stable function derived by using Jacobian\nalgorithm in [17], where \u03c2 is known as the correction factor.\nThis detector is termed CLi SISO Log-MAP MUD. This\n4Message is defined as a vector comprising the reliability values of the\nadjacent variable node. Throughout this paper, the message is represented by\nits computationally efficient and stable Logarithmic-value.\n5It has been suggested in [16] that the normalization can provide the added\nstability of the algorithm and avoid numerical underflow.\n2007 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT 2007) 399\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

However, as we want to\nhave finite number of iterations, we relax this definition such\nthat the factor graph is called cycle-free when its girth, defined\nthe minimum cycle of the variable node in the system, is bigger\nthan six.\nFurthermore, it is easy to see that, by utilizing local\nmarginalization, the complexity of the receiver has been re-\nduced so that it is exponential only to dc instead of to K, where\ndc \u0006 k. In relevant literature, having assigned F\n(\u2022) according\nto (16), this MPA technique is also known as Sum-Product\nAlgorithm (SPA) [13] or, following Pearl\u2019s terminology of\nbelief propagation [16], as Belief Update. In [9], it has been\nshown that, by using CLi Log-MAP detector, the system with\n200% loading condition can achieve a performance very close\nto single-user bound (SUB). The local marginalization shown\nin (16) utilizes the max\u0004 operator. To reduce the complexity,\nmax operator can be assigned instead and, hence, the message\nupdate (12) is given by\nLjn\u2191(xk) == \u03ban,k max\nx\n[n]\n\u2208Xdc\nxk\n( \u2211\nl\u2208\u03ben\\k\nLjn\u2193(xl)\u2212\n1\n2\u03c32\n\u2016yn\u2212hT[n]x[n]\u20162\n)\n.\n(18)\nBy replacing the max\u0004 with the max operator, the resultant\ntechnique is now termed CLi SISO Max-Log-MAP MUD.\nThis new technique will not give a correct marginalization\neven when the underlying factor graph is cycle-free. Never-\ntheless, it can lead to correct assignments.\nIV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nIn this section, we present the simulation results for various\nSLi and CLi SISO MUD techniques presented in previous\nsections. Throughout this paper, Binary Phase Shift Keying\n(BPSK) is used to modulate the information symbols, whereas\nthe transmission is done over AWGN channel. In addition, all\nusers in the system have equal-rate and equal-power.\nA. Performance of Various SLi SISO MUD Techniques\nWe compare the performance of various SLi SISO MUD\ntechniques that meet MMSE criteria for overloaded syn-\nchronous uncoded CDMA systems with N = 12 and K =\n16 with various signature structures, namely conventional\nand LDS structures. The signature for conventional structure\nis optimized using HOS approach; The HOS signature is\ndesigned by creating two sets of orthogonal signatures, by\nusing Gram-Schmidt orthogonalizing algorithm. Each set can\naccommodate 12 users and 4 users, respectively. In addition,\nthe (hard) MMSE-PPIC with the optimized smoothing coeffi-\ncients is included for comparison. The random signatures with\nconventional structure is also included in order to evaluate the\nimprovement made by utilizing HOS-optimized signatures.\nFigure 2 depicts that the parallel SLi SISO MUD outper-\nforms its serial version in any SNR moderate-to-high SNR\nregimes by using any structures. Furthermore, as expected,\nthe performance of SLi MUD that uses hard-values is inferior\nto the SLi SISO MUD that utilizes soft-values.

Convergence Behavior of Various SLi SISO MUD Techniques\nthe performance of the parallel SLi SISO MUD with LDS\nstructure is superior to that with HOS-optimized conventional\nstructure at Eb\/N0 \u2264 11 dB. In addition, the CLi SISO MUD\nis shown the outperform any SLi SISO MUD techniques.\nFigure 3 shows that the serial SLi SISO MUD gives the\nbest first estimate and also converges the fastest, but not\nnecessarily the best, in moderate-to-high SNR. It is to be\nnoted that by using LDS structure, the paralel SLi SISO\nMUD experiences more oscillatory behavior in the higher SNR\nregimes. However, this behavior cannot be observed when the\noptimized conventional signature structure is used.\nIn thesis paper, we intentionally do not include the fading\nchannel into our performance comparison as we concen-\ntrates on AWGN channel, where the interference is mainly\ncaused by the non-orthogonality of the signatures in over-\nloaded condition. However, from literature (cf. [18]), there\nexist some power-control mechanism that can well assist the\nsignal demodulation in overloaded condition. Assuming the\nfading channel can create more degree of freedom in signal\ndemodulation, e.g. through user-ordering mechanism at the\nreceiver, some performance gain can be achieved and may\nlead to different conclusion when comparing the performance\nthe successive and parallel structure of the MMSE-based SLi\nSISO MUD techniques.\n400 2007 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT 2007)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

User Capacity\nIn this sub-section, the performance of LDS structure for\nsynchronous overloaded CDMA-based systems over AWGN\nchannel is investigated via computer simulation. Various LDS\nstructures are presented with different loading conditions. The\nLDS structure whose variable nodes have the same density of\ndv and whose function nodes have the same density of dc is\ncalled regular LDS. Furthermore, the performance of various\nCLi SISO MUD when the user nodes of the underlying factor\ngraph have short cycles, defined as Cycle-of-Four (CoF), are\ninvestigated. In order to summarize the performance of CLi\nSISO MUD, several LDS structures, denoted as LDS N \u00d7K,\nare introduced and can be found in Table I.\nTABLE I\nGENERAL DETAIL OF VARIOUS LDS STRUCTURES\nLDS Schemes \u03b2 Regularity dv % CoF\n60\u00d7 80 1.333 \u0002 3 10\n60\u00d7 120a 2.000 \u0002 3 31\n60\u00d7 120b 2.000 \u0002 3 0\n100\u00d7 250 2.500 3 0\nFirst, we present the system performance of the two MUD\ntechniques in various LDS structures. From Figure 4, we can\nsee that for slightly overloaded condition, i.e. \u03b2 = 1.33, the\nMax-Log-MAP version of the CLi SISO MUD have almost\nsimilar performance to its Log-MAP version. However, as\nwe increase the system loading, by designing an appropriate\nLDS matrix, the Max-Log-MAP version outperforms its Log-\nMAP counterpart, especially at the LDS 100\u00d7 250 where the\nloading is 250%. Figure 5 depicts the convergence behavior\nof both MUD techniques. It suggests that, in AWGN channel,\nthe performance of the Max-Log-MAP version almost always\nconverges, while the Log-MAP version, at higher system\nloading, tends to oscillate and, therefore, cannot find the fixed\npoints.\nC. Effect of Short-Cycles\nFurthermore, Figure 6 shows that the existence of multi-\nple CoF of upto 31% in the LDS structure with the same\nloading condition causes the system performance to degrade\nslightly. Furthermore, the Max-Log-MAP version of the CLi\nSISO MUD tends to be superior to its Log-MAP counterpart.\nThis phenomenon can be understood intuitively. When the\nfactor graph has multiple CoF, the incoming messages will\ncontain the previously outgoing messages. We argue that this\ninformation is mistakenly accepted as a new information and\nthe message update in (16) double-counts this information, due\nto the correction factor given in (17). However, when (18) is\nutilized to revise the message, double-count will not exist.\nHowever, it is important to highlight that while the Max-Log-\nMAP version do not give the correct posterior probability, it\nmay still lead to a correct assignment.\n4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8 8.5 9\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\nEb\/N0 (dB)\nPr\nob\nab\nili\nty\n o\nf E\nrr\nor\n (r\naw\n B\nER\n)\n \n \nCL\u2212LogMAP: LDS 60x80 (10% CoF)\nCL\u2212LogMAP: LDS 60x120a (31% CoF)\nCL\u2212LogMAP: LDS 100x250 (No CoF)\nCL\u2212MaxLogMAP: LDS 60x80 (10% CoF)\nCL\u2212MaxLogMAP: LDS 60x120a (31% CoF)\nCL\u2212MaxLogMAP: LDS 100x250 (No CoF)\nSingle\u2212User Bound\nFig. 4.

Convergence Behavior of various CLi SISO MUD Techniques\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we compare the performance of the successive\nand parallel SLi SISO MUD techniques, which meet MMSE\ncriteria, complemented with HOS-optimized spreading sig-\nnatures for symbol-synchronous uncoded CDMA systems in\noverloaded condition. We show that, while the serial version\nalmost always converges and it converges faster, its parallel\ncounterpart performs the better. Furthermore, we present and\nanalyze the Max-Log-MAP version of CLi SISO MUD, which\nis the extension of previously proposed CLi SISO Log-MAP\nMUD, with CDMA systems utilizing LDS structure. Our\nsimulation confirms that the CLi SISO MUD complemented\nwith LDS structure outperform any SLi SISO MUD techniques\nutilizing conventional structure.\nInterestingly, in higher system loading, the Max-Log-MAP\nversion of the CLi SISO MUD outperforms the more complex\nLog-MAP counterpart, while in lower system loading, their\nperformance is almost identical. Moreover, our simulations\nalso suggest that the Max-Log-MAP version is less sensitive\nto the existence of multiple CoF because it avoids the double\ncounting of the messages.\nThe analysis on, practically, more realistic coded-CDMA\nscenario will be addressed in our future work.\n2007 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT 2007) 401\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
