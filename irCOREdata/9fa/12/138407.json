Towill - University of Cardiff\nand\nMartin Christopher - Cranfield University\nWhen the history of supply chain management comes to be written there will be at\nleast a chapter devoted to the concepts of \u201clean\u201d and \u201cagile\u201d. There has been much\ndebate over the relative merits and de-merits of these ideas \u2013 some of that debate\nbordering on the theological. Definitions of lean and agile can vary significantly\ndepending upon the point of view of the author or commentator. However, there can\nbe little dispute as to the origins of these ideas in a supply chain concept.\nLean thinking can be traced back to the Toyota Production System (TPS) with its\nfocus on the reduction of waste or \u2018muda\u2019. Initially seven forms of waste were\nidentified: overproduction; waiting; unnecessary transportation; inappropriate\nprocessing; unnecessary inventory; unnecessary motion and defects (Ohno, 1988).\nAt the heart of the lean philosophy was the desire to \u201cdo more with less\u201d leading to a\nmore cost-efficient use of resources. To achieve this desired end a number of\nfundamental principles were advocated including level scheduling (haijunka) to\nachieve an even flow and the simplification of products and processes (Womack &\nJones, 1990).\nOn the other hand agility owes its origins to the search for flexibility in\nmanufacturing, particularly through automation technology (Goldman et al., 1995).\nUnderpinning the idea of agile manufacturing is the search for the capability to\nrespond to actual demand rather than planning ahead and making to forecast.\nThe principles of agility have been adopted and applied to supply chain management\nby a number of authors (Harrison et al., 1999; Christopher and Towill, 2000) as a\nmeans of coping with market volatility and uncertain demand. Christopher (2000)\ndefines supply chain agility as a capability that embraces organisational structures,\ninformation systems, logistics processes and in particular, mindsets. It should also be\nemphasised that the need for agility extends beyond the focal firm to embrace the\nentire extended enterprise.\nLeanness and agility should not be thought of as mutually exclusive ideas. Both have\nattractions as general business philosophies and indeed the view increasingly is that,\nwherever possible, they should be combined to create what some have termed\n\u2018leagile\u2019 solutions (Naylor, Naim & Berry, 1999).\nCreating Demand-Driven Supply Chains\nWhilst there are important differences between the lean and agile philosophies, in\npractice the real issue is about responsiveness.\nMost commercial organisations today would aspire to being \u2018customer-centric\u2019. In\nother words they embrace the idea long espoused by marketing that the key to\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\nsustainable competitive advantage lies in putting the customer at the centre of the\nbusiness (McDonald et.al., 2001). Whilst few would challenge the philosophy of\ncustomer orientation that underpins this idea, its implementation has proved to be\nmore problematic.\nTo be truly customer-centric, an organisation needs a supply chain capability that can\nbe responsive to the different needs of different customers.\nThe problem is that conventional supply chains are designed from the \u2018factory\noutwards\u2019 rather than from the \u2018customer backwards\u2019. Underlining traditional\nthinking on supply chain design has been the implicit objective of enabling the\nachievement of purchasing, manufacturing and distribution efficiencies. Thus the\nprinciple objectives of supply chain management have tended to be based upon the\nachievement of low-cost and hence more efficient outcomes for the company, rather\nthan the satisfaction of specific customer needs.\nIt can be argued that today\u2019s market environment calls for a significant shift in the\nfocus of supply chain management. The change in the balance of power in most\ndistribution channels away from suppliers towards customers is now apparent and\nhence the need for supply chains that are \u2018customer-driven\u2019 rather than \u2018supplier-\ndriven\u2019.\nA further reason why supply chains have to become more responsive is because\nvolatility and turbulence in the wider business environment is growing. There are\nmany causes of this volatility and turbulence. For a start product life cycles continue\nto shorten and the rate of innovation increases. At the same time product proliferation\nwithin a category is often growing faster than demand meaning that the volume of\nsales for individual variants is low and getting lower. All these factors combine to\ncreate a world where it has become harder to run the business on the basis of plans\nand forecasts.\nTo meet this challenge the organisation needs to focus its effort upon achieving\ngreater responsiveness such that it can react in shorter timeframes both in terms of\nvolume change and variety change. In other words it needs to be able quickly to\nadjust output to match market demand and to switch rapidly from one variant to\nanother. To a truly responsive business volatility of demand is not a problem; its\nprocesses and organisational structure as well its supply chain relationships enable it\nto cope with whatever demands are placed on it.\nAssociated with the transition from forecast-driven to demand-driven supply chains is\nthe move from make-to-plan (MTP) to build-to-order (BTO). Make-to-plan as a\nstrategy is the traditional approach and is forecast based. On the other hand build-to-\norder implies a capability to respond to customer requirements in the shortest possible\ntime frame. Sometimes a build-to-order strategy is based upon the principle of \u201cmass-\ncustomisation\u201d (Pine, 1993). Mass-customisation seeks to enable a demand-driven\nresponse whilst still maintaining the cost advantages of volume production through\nmake-to-plan. The means to achieving this ideal combination is through a\ncombination of lean and agile processes \u2013 lean processes to make or source the\nstandard modules or sub-assemblies which are then configured or assembled in\nresponse to an actual customer order. The classic and oft-quoted example being Dell,\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\none of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers of computers and related equipment. This\ncombination of lean and agile processes is at the heart of the \u201cleagile\u201d supply chain.\nA Contingency Approach to Supply Chain Design\nIt is suggested here that the applicability of lean and agile approaches (and hybrid\ncombinations) to supply chain design is contingent upon the specific demand and\nsupply conditions.\nFigure 1 suggests that a simple matrix can be derived based upon how \u2018lumpy\u2019 or\n\u2018smooth\u2019 demand and supply is for a particular product. Lumpy demand or supply\nsuggests the possibility of discontinuity due to either market turbulence or uncertain\nsupply. On the other hand smooth demand or supply implies that downstream and\nupstream variability in the supply chain is low.\n(Take in Figure 1)\nDepending on which of the four quadrants the company finds itself positioned \u2013 and a\nmulti-product business will likely find that it occupies more than one \u2013 different\nsupply chain design solutions are implied. These are briefly described below:\n1. Lean\nWhen both upstream supply conditions and downstream demand conditions are\nstable, then the focus should be upon achieving the most efficient flow through the\nsupply chain. Examples of such lean supply chains might include staple grocery\nproducts, e.g. bread.\n2. Agile\nFor these products where demand and supply are both highly variable a much\nmore flexible and responsive supply chain is required. Classic examples where\nagility is required could be consumer electronic products.\n3. Leagile\nWhere upstream supply is relatively stable but downstream demand conditions are\nvariable the hybrid \u2018leagile\u2019 solutions may work best e.g. in fashion clothing.\n4. Agilean\nWhilst perhaps not so common, there will be occasions where downstream\ndemand is stable but upstream supply is not e.g. wood products.\nTable 1 provides some documented examples of the way these four solutions have\nbeen applied in different industrial contexts.\n(Take in Table 1)\nThe De-Coupling Point\nFundamental to the marriage of the lean and agile principles in supply chain design is\nthe idea of the \u2018de-coupling point\u2019. Whilst the original concept of de-coupling related\nprimarily to the material flow it is also important to recognise the related ideas of the\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\n\u2018information flow de-coupling point\u2019 and the possibility of the need for a \u2018virtual de-\ncoupling point\u2019.\nA. Material Flow De-Coupling Point\nThe decoupling point is a standard term given to the position in the material pipeline\nwhere the product flow changes from \u201cpush\u201d to \u201cpull\u201d. It should therefore also\ncorrespond to the Order Penetration Point (Olhager et al. 2006, and Olhager, 2003). It\nis formally defined by Hoekstra and Romme (1992) as:\n\u201cThe point in the product axis to which the customer\u2019s order penetrates. It is\nwhere order driven and the forecast driven activities meet. As a rule, the\nDecoupling Point coincides with an important stock point ~ in control terms a\nmain stock point ~ from which the customer has to be supplied.\u201d\nThe material decoupling point thereby acts as a buffer between upstream and\ndownstream players in the supply chain. This enables upstream players to be\nprotected from fluctuating consumer buying behaviour. The consequence is a\nsmoother upstream dynamics while downstream consumer demand is still met via an\nintermediate product pull from the buffer stock (Mason-Jones and Towill, 1999a).\nFigure 2 summarises the flow diagram corresponding to the foregoing material\npipeline decoupling point definition.\n(Take in Figure 2)\nIn suggesting that agility can only be achieved within a supply chain by concentrating\nas much attention on information flow as is traditionally devoted to material flow, we\nare building substantially on the early experiences of Stalk and Hout (1990). They\nspecifically warn of the dangers of slow information lead-times, summing up the\nproblems with information delays when they state \u201cThe underlying problem here is\nthat once information ages, it loses value\u2026 old data causes amplifications, delay and\noverhead\u2026 The only way out of this disjointed supply system between companies is\nto compress information time so that the information circulating through the system is\nfresh and meaningful\u201d. Overcoming these problems leads naturally to the concept of\nthe \u201cinformation enriched\u201d supply chain (Mason-Jones and Towill, 1999a), which\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\ncontrasts with the \u201cTraditional\u201d supply chain in which everything happens\nsequentially.\nB. Information Flow De-Coupling Point\nInformation flow does not have the same lead-time constraints as a production process\nand via IT it is now possible to reduce the information transmission lead-time from\none end of the chain to the other to zero. The main constraint to enriching a supply\nchain with market sales data is the common attitude that information is power. As a\nconsequence of the \u201ctraditional\u201d culture, companies will often deliberately distort\norder information to mask their intent not only to competitors but even to their own\nsuppliers and customers, unbelievable though this may seem (Pagh and Cooper,\n1998). Figure 3 illustrates this point.\n(Take in Figure 3)\nMarket sales data is the catalyst information for the whole supply chain, holding\nundiluted data describing the consumer demand pattern. Therefore the best way to\nensure everyone in the supply chain gets the most up-to-date and useful information is\nto directly feed each level of the supply chain with the current market sales data.\nManagers should therefore be challenging and questioning mechanisms within the\npipeline structures which appear to delay order transmission throughout the supply\nchain.\nC. Virtual De-Coupling Points\nIn our discussion so far we have concentrated on \u201creal\u201d material flow de-coupling\npoints which exist at the interfaces between \u201clean\u201d and \u201cagile\u201d processes. In other\nwords the fundamental nature of the ways of doing business changes. Typically,\n\u201clean\u201d processes are driven by cost as the \u2019Order Winner\u2019. But \u201cagile\u201d processes\ncompete on the basis of product availability i.e. responsiveness (Christopher and\nTowill, 2000). However in real-world supply chains the \u201clean\u201d enterprise may well\ncomprise a network of cost-competitive processes. The agile value stream may\nsimilarly be constituted from a number of responsive processes. It is at the interface\nbetween processes of the same types where the \u201cvirtual\u201d de-coupling points may be\nfound.\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\n(Take in Figure 4)\nThere are a minimum of two pipelines within the supply chain associated with the\nmaterial flow and the information flow. The authors argue that both flows have their\nown significant decoupling point, the strategic use of which differs due to the\ndynamic effect each has on the performance of the supply chain, (Mason-Jones and\nTowill, 1999b). Only by recognising this and strategically positioning both entities\ncan full performance improvements be realised. However, due to the differences in\nthe two pipelines the information decoupling point requires a definition of its own and\nis defined by Mason-Jones and Towill (1999a) as follows:\nThe point in the information pipeline to which the marketplace order data\npenetrates without modification. It is here where market driven and forecast\ndrive information flows meet.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3 the order information pipeline decoupling point is where\ninformation turns from the high value actual consumer demand data to the typical\nupstream distorted, magnified and delayed order data. Holmstr\u00f6m (1997) provides\ngood examples of order transmission in two quite different value streams within the\nsame European confectionary data. What is demanded from the factory is vastly\ndifferent from current sales. Fortunately, the production scheduler takes an historical\noverview of this \u201cturbulence\u201d to partially smooth upstream material flows.\nTraditionally, in supply chains this tends to be placed at the same point as the material\ndecoupling point and is therefore placed as close to the end consumer as possible.\nThis positioning is very wasteful and limits the effectiveness of the high value\nresource of undistorted order information available on the dynamics of the supply\nchain. Therefore to maximise the strategic potential of these data within the supply\nchain, in direct contrast to the material decoupling point, the information decoupling\npoint should be moved as far upstream as possible. This enables upstream players to\ninclude within the ordering decisions the unbiased, undisturbed, rich information that\nis already available downstream. Hence there will be greater upstream market order\npenetration while leaving the point at which the supply chain directly responds to the\ncustomer (the material decoupling point) intact.\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\nFigure 3 shows the material flow resulting from a strategic product and stock location\nreview undertaken by Jones and Riley (1985). Four value-added processes (roll and\nplane; press lines; finishing operation; and packaging) are shown, with five stock\nlocation points completing the supply chain. Also shown are the relative value of the\nproduct at each location, the relative complexity at each stage, and the corresponding\ndemand variation. Thus at the \u201cfront-end\u201d the relative volatility and complexity both\nincrease significantly (the latter due to the different combinations of artefacts\ndemanded by an individual customer). In this example the review carried out by\nJones and Riley (1985) established that the stocking policy (and hence associated\nreplenishment rules) should be changed. Henceforth the major stocking point (which\nwould now be recognised as the system material flow de-coupling point) is between\nthe press operation and product finishing process, and not as previously as packaged\ninventory.\nIt is now obvious that prior to the material flow de-coupling point in Figure 4 the\nvalue-added processes are primarily \u201clean\u201d. But thereafter the downstream stages\nmust be \u201cagile\u201d if they are to be adequately responsive to customer need. With the\nold design, it would obviously be possible to have huge inventory at the product\n\u201cpackaged\u201d echelon. Yet there could be an associated poor customer service level\nand many stock-outs because the wrong item is in stock as was reported in the UK\npharmaceutical industry (Belk and Steels, 1998). Note that the remaining four\ninventories are \u201cvirtual\u201d, in the sense that their optimum level is not determined by a\nswitch in \u201cmodus operandi\u201d, but by the needs of the associated processes, and in\nparticular their geographical location and transit times between like activities. A\nmore recent comparable leagile study has been undertaken in poultry supply, where\nthere are added problems associated with optimum material flow de-coupling point\nlocation for any particular value stream. These include product perishability and the\nneed for accurate trackability and traceability (van Diyk et al. 2001).\nConclusions\nIt will be apparent from the foregoing discussion that \u2018real\u2019 and \u2018virtual\u2019 de-coupling\npoints play a crucial role in enabling lean and agile processes to be married in the way\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\nmost suited to the demand\/supply conditions. Figure 5 seeks to summarise these\nideas.\n(Take in Figure 5)\nIt seems that the \u201clean vs. agile\u201d debate has now run its course as the various\nprotagonists have recognised that in fact there has been a growing convergence of\nthinking. Both schools pursue the same ultimate end \u2013 the achievement of ever-\nhigher levels of responsiveness. Both are concerned with enhanced value delivery\nthrough the creation of appropriate supply chain solutions. This convergence is seen\nalso in the real world of supply chain management where increasingly organisations\nstrive to create agile capabilities based upon lean foundations.\nWe are also seeing the emergence of the idea that organisations will increasingly need\nto design and implement different solutions for different product\/market\ncircumstances. In other words supply chains will actually comprise multiple\npipelines, each of which will be tailored to the specific market and product\ncharacteristics within which the firm operates.\nThis we see as the major challenge facing supply chain management in the future \u2013\nhow to create the conditions in which common building blocks (i.e. business\nprocesses) can be assembled in different ways to enable the appropriate blend of\n\u2018leanness\u2019 and \u2018agility\u2019 to be achieved in the face of the different contingencies faced\nby the firm.\nInternational Journal of Agile Systems & Management, Vol. 2 No. 4, 2007, pp406-424\nReferences\nBelk, K. and Steels, W.
