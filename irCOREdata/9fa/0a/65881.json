At mitosis nuclear \npore complexes are dismantled and membranes disperse. The mechanism of dispersal is \ncontroversial: one view is that membranes feed into the endoplasmic reticulum, another is \nthat they vesiculate. Using Xenopus egg extracts, nuclei have been assembled and then \ninduced to breakdown by addition of metaphase extract. Field emission scanning electron \nmicroscopy, was used to study disassembly. Strikingly, endoplasmic reticulum-like \nmembrane tubules form from the nuclear surface after the addition of metaphase extracts, \nbut vesicles were also observed. Microtubule inhibitors slowed but did not prevent \nmembrane removal, whereas Brefeldin A which inhibits vesicle formation, stops \nmembrane disassembly, suggesting that vesiculation is necessary. Structures that looked \nlike coated buds were observed and buds were labelled for \u03b2-COP. We show that nuclear \npore complexes are dismantled and the pore closed prior to membrane rupturing, \nsuggesting that rupturing is an active process rather than a result of enlargement of \nnuclear pores. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nThe nuclear envelope (NE) breaks down and reforms each cell cycle. The NE consists of \nthe inner nuclear membrane (INM), the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) which are \nseparated by the perinuclear space and punctuated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs).  \nThe ONM shares proteins and properties with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whose \nlumen is continuous with it. The INM contains a distinct set of proteins, such as lamin B \nreceptor (LBR) and LAP2 and the nuclear lamina (1).  The lamina is a protein network \nthought to provide a structural framework for the NE and an anchoring site for interphase \nchromosomes but may also have a more active role in controlling nuclear organisation \n(2).  Movement of macromolecules across the NE is regulated through the NPCs. NPCs \nare channels of ~120 MD and ~120 nm diameter in vertebrates (3) and may be smaller in \nyeast (4,5), but in many respects are conserved. The NPC has an eightfold rotational \nsymmetry and comprises multiple copies of ~ 30 or more (6,7) nucleoporins. The \nstructural framework of the NPC, consists of the spoke-ring complex, the central \ntransporter (8), cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic rings, attached cytoplasmic filaments and \nthe nuclear basket, (9-14).   \n \nAt mitosis, the NE membranes, NPCs and lamina are disassembled. They are then \nrecycled to form new NEs around the chromatin in telophase and early G1. NE assembly \nhas been characterised in a variety of model systems including Xenopus egg extracts. \nWhen sperm chromatin is added to interphase extracts it decondenses, membrane vesicles \nbind (16-18) in a cell-cycle regulated manner (18,19).  Once bound, vesicles fuse to form \na double membrane, NPCs assemble in flattened patches, and the membranes undergo \n\u201csmoothing\u201d which requires nuclear transport (17,20).  NPC assembly is a stepwise \nprocess via intermediates such as dimples, pores, star-rings, thin rings and the \ncytoplasmic ring with cytoplasmic filaments (10,, 21, 22). Older electron microscopy \ndata suggested the formation of NPC-like structures (\u201cpre-pores\u201d) on the chromosome \nsurface prior to membrane addition (23). More recently it was shown that NPC assembly \nrequired the attachment of the Nup107 complex to the chromatin surface prior to \nmembrane assembly (24), which resurrected the pre-pore idea. In Drosophila embryos, \nNPC disassembly appears to be a stepwise reverse of the assembly process (22). \n \nSeveral studies support the idea that NE-specific vesicles form during mitosis and remain \nseparate from the ER (18, 25-29).  However Ellenberg et al (1997) (30) demonstrated in \nliving cells that during mitosis LBR-GFP was redistributed by diffusion from the NE into \nthe ER, which remained intact. Yang et al (1997) (31) examined the fate of NE proteins \nin intact fixed mammalian cells and demonstrated that LAP1, LAP2 and gp210 were \nlocalized throughout the ER.  They argued that temporal differences between gp210 and \nLBR binding to the NE during reassembly (25) may be due to the fact that their \nappropriate binding sites appear asynchronously and not due to the fact that the proteins \nare in distinct vesicles. In contrast, it has been shown that two distinct vesicle types, \nNEP-B and NEP-A, are necessary for NE assembly (18, 29). Recently it has become \nclear that the mitotic membranes used to assemble the NE during telophase\/early G1 are \ndistinct from bulk ER membranes because for their assembly they require the complex \np97-UFD1-NPL4 (32) as well as Ran (33, 34, 35) whereas ER formation does not (33). \nHowever, this distinction could be achieved by creating microdomains in the ER (36). \n Recently, it was found that NE breakdown may involve components of COPI, which are \ninvolved in forming vesicles during membrane trafficking. These components are \nrecruited by nucleoporins (37,38). Therefore a role for vesicle formation in NE \ndisassembly is distinctly possible. Coat proteins are recruited by the small GTPases ADP-\nribosylation factors (ARFs) when in their active GTP-bound form.  Brefeldin A inhibits \nnucleotide exchange factors that activate ARFs (39, 40) and inhibits NE breakdown (37) \nsuggesting that ARFs have a role in NE disassembly.  \n \nGeorgatos et al (1997) (41) showed that microtubules contribute to the disassembly of the \nNE but microtubule integrity is not necessary for nuclear lamina breakdown and \nmembrane fragmentation (42).  Microtubules appear to play a direct role in disassembly \nby forming nuclear indentations (41). Recent data showed that microtubules created \ntension on the NE which induced NE tearing and removal of the membranes towards the \ncentrosomes (43) in a dynein dependent manner (44). Although microtubule driven ER \ndynamics are inhibited during metaphase (45) it may be possible that microtubules are \nutilised during prophase to direct the NE-linked ER away from the nucleus.  \n \nWe have used feSEM to study the steps of NE disassembly in Xenopus egg extracts. We \nhave found evidence for both the formation of ER-like tubules as well as vesicles during \nNE breakdown. Further evidence for the role of vesiculation is provided using drugs that \ndisrupt microtubule and membrane dynamics. We also find that NPCs disassemble and \nthe pore closes up prior to membrane rupturing. This challenges current models that \npropose that after removal of NPC proteins, the nuclear pores expand as the membranes \nare removed (46).  \n \nResults \nNE disassembly in Xenopus egg extracts \nTo look at the structural changes of the NE during disassembly, nuclei were first \nassembled in interphase Xenopus egg extracts. Assembled nuclei are generally \nspheroidal, the DNA (stained with Hoechst 33258 \u2013 Fig. 1a left inset) appears diffuse \nthroughout the nucleus and it is surrounded by a complete DHCC staining membrane \n(Fig. 1a right inset). The nuclear surface was examined using feSEM (Fig. 1a), and was \nsomewhat convoluted and had many NPCs (Fig. 2a).  \n \nTo induce metaphase an equal volume of metaphase extract was added to the assembly \nreaction. Chromatin condensation is the first most obvious change seen by light \nmicroscopy (insets in Fig.1b and d). The chromatin becomes a compact body in what \nappears to be a loose bag of membrane This is demonstrated both by fluorescence \nmicroscopy  (Fig. 1d inset) and by feSEM where the chromatin is seen as a dense \nelongated body \u201cdraped\u201d in a loose membrane bag (delineated by dotted line in Fig. 1d).  \n \nER tubules and vesicles emanate from the NE \nAn early and striking event, seen most clearly by feSEM (Fig. 1b), is the appearance of \nER-like membrane tubules, which in some, but not all, nuclei emanate mainly from one \nend of the condensing nucleus (Fig. 1c). In these nuclei the membrane tubules have an \n\u201castral\u201d appearance which led us to suspect a microtubule involvement in their \norganisation.  Membrane tubules are approximately 200 nm in diameter (Fig. 2b and c) \nand are ER-like as they have ribosomes on their surface and are similar to the ER tubules \nthat assemble in these extracts. Such ER tubules were previously observed by metal \nshadow TEM and labelled with antibodies to ER markers (45,47). One difference, \nhowever, is that the membrane tubules that are associated with the NE (Fig. 2b, large \narrows) appear more flattened than general ER tubules which have a spherical profile. \nThis suggests that proteins may be present in the NE membranes that are responsible for \nflattening. An NE tubule is compared to an ER tubule in Fig. 2e and f. \n \nIn addition to the ER-like tubules, many vesicles of varying size and ribosome density are \nat the nuclear surface (Fig. 2c and d).  The vesicles appear to be budding from the NE. \nSome vesicles have many ribosomes on their surface whereas others have few or none.  \n \nIt is possible that the vesicles could be remnants of membrane tubules damaged during \nspecimen preparation. Therefore we looked for evidence of vesicles by light microscopy \nof \u201clive\u201d disassembling nuclei, which have not been fixed or isolated. Nuclei were \nassembled in egg extracts, a vital membrane fluorescent dye (BODIPY FL C5-ceramide) \nwas added and the nuclei were induced to disassemble. We used confocal microscopy to \nlook at optical slices of the disassembling nuclei (Fig. 2g). We detected numerous small \nmembrane containing particles associated with the disassembling NE which could be \nvesicles. By scrolling though optical sections taken from the entire nucleus we could \nshow that these were discrete particles and not sections through tubules. This suggests \nthat the vesicles observed by feSEM are not artefacts of preparation. \n \nAt later stages, the membrane ruptures and much of it is removed revealing condensed \nchromatin (Fig. 2d). By the end of disassembly, some vesicles and tubules remain \nattached to the surface and the nucleus has become long, thin and sperm shaped (Fig. 2d). \nRupture points can also be detected in optical sections (Fig. 2g). \n \nCoated bud like structures are observed and a \u03b2-COP antibody labels NE buds \nRecently it was shown that COPI complexes are involved in NE disassembly (37,38), but \nit was not shown whether this was for formation of coated vesicles from the nuclear \nmembranes. We observed buds and vesicles attached to the disassembling NE (Fig. 2c \nand d). Intriguingly, we find structures that look like buds that are coated with particles \n(Fig. 2h and i) that are reminiscent of the published deep etch rotary shadow EM surface \nstructure of COPII-coated vesicles (48). We suggest that these are indeed COPI-coated \nbuds. To support this suggestion we immuno-gold labelled disassembling nuclei with an \nantibody to \u03b2-COP, using the same commercial antibody characterised by Liu et al. \n(2003) (37), and found a specific localisation of the gold particles on buds on the NE \nsurface (Fig. 2j and k). \u03b2-COP labelling was observed at all times during membrane \ndisassembly.  \n \nDisassembly of the NPCs  \nThe membrane surface of a fully assembled nucleus has many NPCs (Fig. 3a).  At high \nmagnification, the cytoplasmic filaments, cytoplasmic ring and some internal structures \nof the NPC are visualised (Fig. 4a).  The NPC has an external diameter of ~105 nm, \nconsistent with that previously reported in feSEM studies of NPCs assembled in egg \nextracts (21). NPC disassembly is not synchronous and there are NPCs at different stages \nof disassembly present on the surface of a single nucleus (Fig.3 and Fig.4i). \n  \nMature NPCs (Fig. 3a, Fig. 4a) begin to disassemble with the removal of the cytoplasmic \nfilaments (Fig. 4a, stars) revealing the thin ring (Fig. 3b, TR, Fig. 4b). The star-ring (Fig. \n3b, SR, Fig. 4c and d), which lies under the cytoplasmic ring (21,49), is infrequently seen \nduring disassembly, suggesting it is rapidly removed. Stabilised pores are apparent (Fig. \n3b and c, SP, Fig. 4e) and sometimes loose the central material (Fig. 4f). They become \ndimples (Fig. 3b and c, D, Fig. 4g and h) and finally close up to give an almost or \ncompletely pore-free membrane surface (Fig. 3c). This then ruptures, exposing the \nchromatin (Fig. 3d). The relative number of these different intermediates was quantified \nover time (Fig. 3f), showing the gradual shift from larger more complex structures to \nsmaller simpler ones as the NE disassembles.  \n \nAlthough these various disassembling structures of the NPC are seen at fixed time points, \nwe have placed them in order of decreasing complexity and size. This appears to be \nmore-or-less a reversal of the assembly process previously reported in egg extracts (21) \nand is similar to disassembly in Drosophila early embryos (22). Also we often have \nobserved \u201cempty\u201d central regions, particularly at the stabilised pore stage (Fig. 4f) which \nwas not observed during assembly. This may be consistent with the first permeablisation \nstage observed in starfish oocytes (50)  \n \nRupturing of the NE appears to be independent from NPC disassembly \nRupturing of the nuclear envelope generally occurs after completion of NPC disassembly \nand closing up of the pores (Fig. 2d and Fig. 3d). Generally, NPC disassembly was \ncompleted in 20-30 minutes after addition of metaphase extract. At this stage we \nobserved nuclei with intact NE but with no NPCs or just a few late disassembly \nintermediates such as pores and dimples. 10-20 minutes later we found many nuclei with \nruptured NEs, which were not observed at the earlier time period. Quantification of the \ntotal number of NPCs and intermediates at each time point (Fig. 3e) showed that NPC \nrelated structures decreased in number over time and hence pores were closing up. This \nsuggested that NE rupture occurs after most nuclear pores have closed and argues against \nthe possibility that rupture originates at the pores as previously suggested (46).  \n \nInhibitors of membrane and microtubule dynamics affect NE breakdown  \nThe effects of several reagents that are expected to affect the processes of NPC and NE \ndisassembly were examined by light microscopy and feSEM (Fig. 5). Nuclei were \nassembled in interphase extract then mixed with an equal volume of metaphase extract \ncontaining either Nocodazole, Brefeldin A, or GTP\u03b3S. Nuclei were sampled over time \nand prepared for light microscopy or feSEM. \n \nMicrotubule inhibitors slow down but do not inhibit nuclear membrane disassembly \nNocodazole inhibits microtubule polymerisation. Microtubules have been shown to be \ninvolved in the formation of tubular ER networks in egg extracts (45) and have also been \nshown to be involved in deformation of the nuclear membranes during mitosis (41, 43, \n44). Therefore we wanted to test whether formation of membrane tubules observed \nduring normal disassembly in egg extracts (Fig. 2) was dependent on microtubules and \nwhether the formation of these membrane tubules was required for nuclear membrane \ndisassembly. \n \nFluorescence microscopy showed that nocodazole (10 \u03bcg\/ml) did not effect chromatin \ncondensation, which occurred at the normal rate, but it did slow down membrane \ndisassembly, and some membrane was often still present on the chromatin surface after \nseveral hours (inset Fig. 5d inset).  After about one hour the membranes are still fully \nintact with Nocodazole (Fig. 5c inset) whereas they are difficult to detect by light \nmicroscopy in its absence.  \n \nConsistently, feSEM showed that the membrane is still intact at ~1 hour of incubation in \nmetaphase extract with Nocodazole (Fig. 5c) whereas during normal disassembly it \nwould be mostly disassembled after 30 minutes (Fig. 3d). It then takes at least another 30 \nminutes to achieve the same level of disassembly in the presence of Nocodazole (Fig.5d). \nHowever, even after several hours there are some nuclei whose membrane has not \nruptured, whereas during normal disassembly we only found nuclei that had ruptured. \nThis suggests that rupturing was not always dependent on microtubules.  \n \nWe do see membrane tubules in the presence of Nocodazole. In fact the steps of \nmembrane disassembly appear very similar to normal disassembly, just slower. Therefore \nNocodazole does not appear prevent the formation of membrane tubules. However it is \npossible that the reduction in membrane tubule movement under such conditions (51) \ncould (partially) account for the slow down in membrane removal.  \n \nNocodazole did not appear to significantly inhibit NPC disassembly. \n \nBrefeldin A allows normal NPC disassembly but inhibits membrane disassembly \n \nBrefeldin A prevents the formation of the GTP bound form of ARF1 by inhibiting its \nnucleotide exchange factor (39, 40). This prevents the recruitment and assembly of coat \nproteins required for vesicle formation. However, it does not prevent the movement of \nmembranes between for instance the Golgi and ER which instead form connections of \ntubular membranes. Therefore addition of Brefeldin A to a nuclear disassembly reaction \nshould test whether vesicle budding is necessary for nuclear membrane disassembly. \n \nFluorescence microscopy shows that addition of Brefeldin A (5 \u03bcg\/ml) to nuclear \ndisassembly reactions caused a complete inhibition of chromatin condensation and \nmembrane breakdown for several hours (Fig.5g inset). NPC disassembly appears to be \nnormal as seen by feSEM (Fig. 5e and f). After 50-60 minutes where, in parallel controls, \nthe membrane had been disrupted, and at least partially removed (Fig. 3d), the NPCs \ncompletely disassemble but the membrane was still fully intact (Fig. 5c), and remained so \nfor several hours. Therefore in agreement with previous results (37,38) there is a \nBrefeldin A sensitive process that is required for the complete disassembly of the nuclear \nmembranes. The most likely candidate for such a process is the formation of coated \nvesicles. This suggestion is supported by our observation of \u03b2-COP containing membrane \nbuds on the NE surface (Fig 2h-k). Brefeldin A does not appear to affect NPC \ndisassembly in these experiments.  \n \nGTP\u03b3S slows membrane removal \nGTP\u03b3S, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP is a potent inhibitor of nuclear envelope \nassembly and inhibits vesicle fusion and NPC assembly (20). Disassembly, however, \ninvolves tubule and\/or vesicle formation (which we would not predict to be affected by \nGTP\u03b3S). Fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5j inset) showed that although GTP\u03b3S had no \neffect on chromatin condensation, it slowed down membrane disassembly.  At about one \nhour in normal disassembly the membrane is ruptured and mostly removed.  However, in \nthe presence of GTP\u03b3S most of the membrane still surrounds the nucleus, although some \nrupturing may occur (Fig.5j inset arrows). By later times, the membrane is completely \nremoved in some nuclei (Fig. 5k) but not in others (Fig. 5l). Therefore, similar to \nNocodazole, GTP\u03b3S slowed but did not completely inhibit membrane disassembly, \nsuggesting a role for GTP hydrolysis in nuclear membrane disassembly.  \n \nDiscussion \nNuclear Membrane Disassembly \nThe data presented here suggests that NE disassembly may be divided into the following \nevents: (a) dispersal of nuclear membranes into the cytoplasm via vesicles; (b) dispersal \nof nuclear membranes into the ER via membrane tubules; (c) NPC disassembly; (d) \nsealing of the nuclear pore; (e) rupture of the NE. \n \nNE is fed into the ER during disassembly \nER-like tubules are formed at the NE surface during NE disassembly. This is consistent \nwith previous studies demonstrating that NE integral membrane proteins move into the \nER during mitosis (30, 31). It is uncertain if the tubules have grown out of the NE and \nhence are derived entirely from nuclear membranes, or if cytoplasmic ER tubules in the \nextract have been directed to fuse with the NE during prophase to allow the flow of \nnuclear membranes into the ER. These would be very different mechanisms. The first \nwould be a process driven from the NE and might involve microtubules\/cytoplasmic \ndynein (44) driven membrane tubule extension. The second would require extensive \nfusion of ER tubules with the NE, followed by passive flow of membranes released from \nthe NE when protein structures such as the lamina and NPCs are disassembled. \n \nSince inhibition of microtubule dynamics inhibits ER membrane tubule extension (52), \nwe predicted that it would also inhibit nuclear membrane disassembly if this was \ndependent on tubule extension. We found that Nocodazole, a microtubule assembly \ninhibitor, failed to completely inhibit nuclear membrane disassembly (53). This indicated \nthat nuclear membrane removal was not completely dependent on membrane tubule \nextension. However, the rate of NE breakdown was slowed, in agreement with other \nrecent studies (43, 44), suggesting that microtubules are involved. It has been shown (41) \nthat microtubule asters may contribute to the orderly disassembly of the NE by causing \nspecific indentations in the NE in prophase. In the presence of Nocodazole, however, NE \ndisassembly appeared less ordered. Although evidence was not presented for any \nattachment of aster microtubules to any membranes, it is intriguing that we sometimes \nobserved arrays of membranes that have the appearance of asters as if the NE\/ER tubules \nare running along the astral microtubules. These findings suggest that microtubules aid \nbut are not essential for NE disassembly and this may be due to a disorganisation of the \nmembrane tubule streaming from the NE. Likewise, in the secretory pathway, \nmicrotubules are used, probably to increase the organisational efficiency, but are not \nessential (54).  We did find that membrane tubules were still present during disassembly \nwith Nocodazole, suggesting that tubule formation was not prevented when microtubules \nwere inhibited. Therefore it seems likely that the role of microtubules may be to \nefficiently extend the membrane tubules away from the NE rather than in the initial \nformation of the tubules.  \n \nVesicles also form at the NE during NEBD \nDifferent types of vesicles were also observed apparently budding from the NE. The \ndifferent morphologies of these vesicles (rough and smooth) suggest that there may be a \nsorting process.  Vigers and Lohka (1991) (55) identified two types of vesicles called \nNEP-A and NEP-B. It was proposed that NEP-B vesicles are targeted to the chromatin \nwhereas NEP-A contribute to NE growth.  In support of this, it was shown (29) that two \nfunctionally and biochemically distinct vesicle types are necessary for NE assembly.  \n \nWe sort additional evidence for vesicle formation. We tested whether Brefeldin A, which \ninhibits vesicle formation in the secretory system, could also inhibit NE disassembly. \nBrefeldin A inhibits nucleotide exchange factors that activate ARFs (39, 40) which, in \ntheir active GTP-bound form, recruit and assemble the coat proteins essential for \ntrafficking (reviewed in 56, 57). Brefeldin A inhibited membrane breakdown but not \nNPC disassembly, resulting in an intact and stable NE with no NPCs. The inhibition of \nNE disassembly by Brefeldin A suggests that disassembly may be regulated by a member \nof the ARF family. These results confirm previous findings (37) that Brefeldin A inhibits \nNE breakdown and that Arf may be involved (58). Liu et al. (2003) (37) confirmed the \nrole of Arf with a dominant negative peptide of the protein and by immuno-depleting it. \nConversely, Gant and Wilson (1997) (59) did not see an effect of Brefeldin A. We have \nfound that the effects of Brefeldin A are concentration dependent and that the extracts are \ninherently variable, so these differences could be experimental variation. However, it is \nclear that in these experiments NE breakdown was affected by Brefeldin A suggesting a \nrole for vesicle formation.  \n \nThe recent finding that COPI complexes have a role in NE disassembly (37, 38) suggest \nthat vesicle formation at the NE is driven by COPI coating. We observed what appeared \nto be buds on the surface of the outer nuclear membrane during NE disassembly. \nSometimes these were smooth, sometimes they had ribosomes and occasionally a dense \nnetwork presumably of protein was on the surface. It is possible that such a structure \ncould be a COPI coat and indeed when we labelled disassembling NEs with an antibody \nto \u03b2-COP (a COPI component) we found that buds were often densely labeled with the \nantibody whereas the surrounding membrane was very lightly labeled if at all. This shows \nthat \u03b2-COP is concentrated on the buds and suggests that at least some buds are formed \nby COPI coating. It is possible that the buds that do not obviously have coats have \nalready been fully formed and have been uncoated. We cannot rule out that alternatively \nthere may be additional mechanisms or that there are some artefactual buds and vesicles. \nHowever it does seem clear that COPI driven vesicle formation is an important step in \nNE disassembly. Using feiSEM we can only observe events at the ONM surface. It is \npossible that \u03b2-COP also drives vesicle formation from the INM because it is recruited by \nthe nucleoplasmic nucleoporin NUP153 (37,38), but this remains to be shown.  \n \nInterestingly, unlike the microtubule dependent step, the Brefeldin A sensitive step could \nnot be by-passed. Although NPCs disassembled, the nuclei did not reduce in size and \nmembranes appeared to remain intact. This could mean that tubule extension as well as \nvesicle formation is sensitive to Brefeldin A. This seems unlikely because in the secretory \npathway Brefeldin A actually induces tubule formation (60). However, it could also be \nthat the initial deformation of the flat outer nuclear membrane into tubules could be \nBrefeldin A sensitive. Alternatively, vesicle formation may have to start before extension \nof tubules can be initiated. This could be achieved via a biochemical checkpoint that only \nallows bulk flow of nuclear membranes into the ER after mitotic\/meiotic vesicle \nformation is initiated. The purpose of such a checkpoint could be to prevent the bulk \nmovement of nuclear membranes into the ER during interphase.  \n \nNPC Disassembly \nThe NPC consists of several layers beginning on the cytoplasmic side with the \ncytoplasmic filaments, the cytoplasmic ring, the internal filaments and the star ring which \nlie above the central transporter and inner spoke ring complex (10, 11). On the \nnucleoplasmic side are internal filaments, nucleoplasmic ring and the basket.  \nDisassembly of the NPC appears to occur via intermediates with each layer being \nremoved roughly sequentially. This pattern of NPC disassembly mirrors, loosely, the \nmodel of NPC assembly proposed previously (21) where the NPC was proposed to \nassemble in a modular and stepwise fashion. For disassembly, the reverse appears to \nhappen with the gradual removal of the cytoplasmic ring subunits followed by the thin \nring subunits etc. leaving a structure of decreasing complexity until the NPC is reduced to \na pore which then disappears. This confirms observations we made previously in \nDrosophila early embryos (22).  \n \nRupturing the NE \nNPCs and intermediates were often not observed on ruptured NEs, suggesting that \nnuclear pores had closed up before rupturing. We also observed NPC-free nuclei prior to \nrupturing, whereas at later time points all nuclei had ruptured. This suggests that nuclei \nwith no NPCs had ruptured and that the rupturing mechanism was distinct from NPC \ndisassembly and did not involve expansion of nuclear pores. We find that generally NPCs \nare removed and the pore is closed up before the NE is ruptured. This is not consistent \nwith models that propose that rupturing is facilitated by the removal of the NPC, leaving \nthe pore which then expands as membrane is removed (46). Indeed we never see \nexpanded pores. It has been shown by time-resolved confocal microscopy that the NE is \npermeabilised during NE breakdown in a two step process (52). 70kD fluorescent \nDextran was injected into a starfish oocyte prior to NE breakdown. Before breakdown \nstarts, the Dextran cannot diffuse through the NPC (it is too large). It then initially enters \nslowly in the first phase followed by a rapid entry phase. It was argued that the first slow \nphase is a result of the partial dismantling of the NPC to give a small but free diffusion \nchannel, which would be consistent with the \u201cempty\u201d stabilised pores that we observe. \nThe second rapid phase was suggested to be enlargement of the pores. We suggest that \nthe second phase is due to a rupturing event, possibly from a single point which results in \na rapidly expanding hole, independent of NPC disassembly. As well as our data, the fact \nthat rupturing occurs at only one or two points (52) rather than a multitude of points that \nwould result from an enlargement of many nuclear pores supports this view. Although it \nmakes intuitive sense that the membrane removal should be facilitated by pore expansion, \nthere is no direct evidence to our knowledge that supports this idea. Moreover such a \nmechanism would still result in a network of tubules surrounding the chromosomes \nwhich would have to be fragmented by multiple fission events. We never observe such a \nnetwork. Fig. 6 shows the sequence of events that we suggest occur during NE \nbreakdown.  \n \nMaterials and Methods \nBuffers and reagents \n Lysis buffer: 250 mM sucrose, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol \n(DTT), 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.58), 50 \u03bcg\/ml cycloheximide, 5 \u03bcg\/ml cytochalasin B, 10 \n\u03bcg\/ml aprotinin, 10 \u03bcg\/ml leupeptin.

Membrane fix: 80 mM Pipes -\nKOH (pH 6.8), 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM sucrose, 2% paraformaldehyde (v\/v), 0.25% \nglutaraldehyde (v\/v). Tannic acid fix: 2% glutaraldehyde (v\/v), 0.2% tannic acid (w\/v) in \n100 mM Hepes, pH 7.4.  Extract buffer (EB): 100 mM KCL, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM \nHepes, pH 7.5, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.   \n \nPreparation of egg extracts from Xenopus \n Cell-free extracts were prepared from Xenopus activated (interphase extracts) or \nunactivated (metaphase extracts) eggs as previously described (61, 62).  Briefly, eggs \nwere lysed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 12 min, washed in 0.1 M NaCl and rinsed in \neither lysis (interphase extracts) or M lysis buffer (metaphase extracts). Cytoplasm was \nspun at 30,000g for 10 min and supplemented with an ATP regenerating system (1 mM \nATP, 50 \u03bcg\/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 mM creatine phosphate).  Aliquots were \nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC.   \n \nNuclear assembly and disassembly reactions \nAssembly reactions were initiated by addition of sperm chromatin, at 2,000 sperm\/\u03bcl \nextract.  Assembly reactions were incubated at room temperature (22-24oC) for up to 3 \nhours before initiation of the nuclear disassembly. Disassembly of assembled nuclei was \ninitiated by addition of an equal volume of metaphase extract. The final concentration of \nnocodazole in the disassembly reaction was 10 \u03bcg\/ml. Taxol was added to a final \nconcentration of 10 \u03bcM. GTP\u03b3S was added to a final concentration of 2 mM and GTP at \nthe same concentration was a control. Brefeldin A was added to a final concentration of 5 \n\u03bcg\/ml. N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), was added to a final concentration of 5mM.  Excess \nNEM was quenched by the addition of 2 \u03bcl of 125 mM DTT.  As a control DTT and \nNEM were mixed together 2 min before addition to the assembled extract.    \n \nPreparation of nuclei for feSEM \nSamples were prepared for analysis by feSEM as previously described (21).  Briefly, \naliquots (4\u03bcl) were resuspended in MWB and spun onto silicon chips at 3,000 rpm for 10 \nmin at 4oC.  Specimens were then fixed in Membrane fix for 10 min, washed in 0.2 M \ncacodylate pH 7.2, fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.2 M cacodylate for 10 min.  After rinsing twice \nin water, samples were finally stained in 1% uranyl acetate for 10 min.  Specimens were \nthan dehydrated in a series of increasing alcohol concentrations (30-100%) followed by \nimmersion in Arklone and critically point dried.  Finally, specimens were sputter-coated \nwith a 3nm of chromium or tantalum and then examined in a Topcon (ABT) ISI-DS-130F \nfield emission scanning electron microscope (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 30 \nkV accelerating voltage. Some samples were coated with a Cressington 308 chromium \ncoater and examined with a Hitachi S5200 feiSEM.  \n \nImmuno-gold feSEM \nNuclei were spun onto chips as above and fixed in membrane fix with the gluteraldehyde \nomitted for 10 minutes. Chips were washed in PBS and placed in 100mM glycine in PBS \nfor 10 minutes, washed again and transferred to PBS with 1% fish skin gelatine (Sigma) \nfor 1 hour. They were then incubated with the COPI antibody (Affinity Bio Reagents) at \na 1:20 dilution in PBS for 1 hour, washed 4 times for 5 minutes in PBS then incubated \nwith 5nm gold secondary (Amersham) for 1 hour and washed 4 times 5 minutes in PBS. \nSamples were then fixed again in membrane fix and processed for feSEM as above. To \ndetermine the position of the gold particles, a backscatter electron image was obtained at \nthe same time as the secondary electron image. Gold particles appear as bright white dots \nin the backscatter image. Using Adobe Photoshop, the backscatter image was pasted as a \nseparate layer onto the secondary image. This allows us to accurately mark the position \nof the gold particles on the secondary image, before removing the backscatter image. The \npositions of the gold particles are shown as yellow dots.  \n \nFluorescence microscopy \n 1\u03bcl extract was place on a slide and mixed with an equal volume of MWB containing \n10\u03bcg\/ml Hoechst 33258 and 10\u03bcg\/ml 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DHCC), then \nviewed on a fluorescent microscope.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was funded by the Human Frontiers Science Programme, Cancer Research UK \nand the Wellcome Trust (Grant Number 065860 to MWG and 075151 to EK).

Bar in (e) = 1.67\u03bcm refers to \nall images. \n \nFigure 2.  FeSEM of disassembly at high magnification. (a) Interphase nucleus, small \narrows indicate NPCs. (b and c) Early disassembly, large tail-less arrows are ER-like \ntubules, large tailed arrows are ribosome-free vesicles, small tailed arrows are ribosome \ncontaining vesicles. (d) Ruptured NE showing exposed chromatin (Chr). (e) Flattened \nmembrane tubule emanating from nucleus compared to (f) ER tubule in cytosol. (g) \nConfocal optical section of NE after rupture (arrowhead) showing putative vesicles \n(arrows). (h and i) Buds with coat-like structures. (j and k) Buds labelled with anti-\u03b2-\nCOP immunogold label (yellow dots).  \n \nFigure 3.  Disassembly of NPCs over time. There is a gradual shift from mature NPCs (a) \nto dimples (b) to NPC-free membrane (c) which subsequently ruptures (d). TR, thin ring; \nSR, star ring; SP, stabilised pore; D, dimple. (e) Quantification of the number of NPCs \nper \u03bcm2 during disassembly (total number counted t=0 minutes, 302; t=10 minutes, 137; \nt=20 minutes, 37. (f) change in relative percentage of different types of intermediate over \ntime. \n \nFigure 4.Proposed intermediates involved in NPC disassembly. (a) Interphase NPC \nshowing cytoplasmic filaments (stars) and central structures. (b) Thin ring is visible after \nremoval of cytoplasmic ring subunits. (c) star ring exposed. (d) star ring partially \ndismantled. (e) Stabilised pore. (f) central structures completely removed, edge of hole \nhas rigid appearance which is probably part of the inner spoke ring (tailed arrow). (g) \nEdge of the hole becomes smooth presumably as the inner spoke ring is dismantled \n(arrow). (h) hole shrinks and presumably closes.  \n \nFigure 5. (a-d) Disassembly in the presence of Nocodazole. (a) early (15 minutes after \nadding mitotic extract), (b) mid (30 minutes), (c) late (60 minutes) and (d) 90 minutes. (e-\ng) same time points as (a-c) but in the presence of Brefeldin A. (h-l) disassembly with \nGTP\u03b3S over same time period as (a-d). The insets show equivalent nuclei in the light \nmicroscope stained for DNA (left) or membrane (right). \n  \nFigure 6. Model for NE disassembly. (a) Lamina disassembles, coated buds form, NPCs \nstart to disassemble. (b) vesicles pinch off, NPCs disassemble and ER tubules extend \nfrom the NE along microtubules (rods). (c) Membrane tubules continue to extend and \nvesicles continue to bud off as the nuclear pores close up. (d-f) membrane ruptures \nexposing the chromatin.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5 \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6 \n"}
