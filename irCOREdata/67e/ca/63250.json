This paper presents the remote sensing techniques of measuring \nsea states, currents and bathymetry by using an X-band nautical radar. It \nbriefly describes the fundamental methods to infer sea state information \n(e.g., ocean wave and current parameters) from nautical radar imagery. In \naddition, this work describes in detail the performance of the Wave Moni-\ntoring System WaMoS II (a commercial system for real-time monitoring \nof wave fields based on nautical radar technology). Two examples of \nWaMoS II applications are presented: the first application is an example of \nthe standard WaMoS II installation for sea state measurements, and the \nsecond application shows results of a research project aiming at the deter-\nmination of shallow water bathymetry by means of nautical radar imagery. \n1 Introduction \nWave information is usually derived from time series of the sea surface \nelevation measured at a certain location in the open sea. These measure-\nments are carried out by in-situ sensors such as buoys, lasers, and pressure \nsensors with high temporal resolution (e.g., sampling frequencies of \nabout 2Hz). However, deployments of such sensors are limited by the local \nwater depth, as well as the mooring facilities. For instance buoys can be \neasily damaged by ships or during severe meteorological conditions. Fur-\nthermore, the use of point measurements assumes that the obtained wave \ninformation is representative for a particular area, which is often not the \ncase, particularly in coastal waters, where coastal effects like wave refrac-\ntion, diffraction, shoaling etc. take place. Under these conditions, the sea \nstate can vary significantly in the area of interest.  \n2      Katrin He\u00dfner, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Nieto-Borge and Paul S. Bell \nComplementing these point measurements described above, the imaging \nof the sea surface based on remote sensing techniques provides informa-\ntion about the spatial variability sea state in the area of interest. One of \nthese techniques is based on the use of ordinary nautical radars to analyse \nocean wave fields.  \nIt is known that, under various conditions, signatures of the sea surface \nare visible in the near range (less than 3 nautical miles) of nautical X-band \nradar images. These signatures are known as sea clutter, which is undesir-\nable for navigation purposes. Therefore, the sea clutter is generally sup-\npressed by filtering algorithms. Sea clutter is caused by the backscatter of \nthe transmitted electromagnetic waves from the short sea surface ripples in \nthe range of half the electromagnetic wavelength (i.e. ~1.5 cm). The longer \nwaves like swell and wind sea become visible as they modulate the back-\nscatter signal mainly via hydrodynamic modulation of the ripples by the \ninteraction with the longer waves, tilt modulation due to the changes of the \neffective incidence angle along the long wave slope, and the partial shad-\nowing of the sea surface by higher waves (Keller and Wright, 1975, Alpers \net al., 1981; Plant, 1990; Wenzel, 1990; Lee et al., 1995). \nSince standard X-band nautical radar systems allow the sea surface to be \nscanned with high temporal and spatial resolution, they are able to monitor \nthe sea surface in both time and space. Hence, the combination of the tem-\nporal and spatial wave information allows the determination of unambigu-\nous directional wave spectra. As nautical radar imagery covers an area of \nthe sea surface it also allows the observation of spatial variations in the \nwave field. Furthermore, the use of nautical radar as a remote sensor al-\nlows to measurement of wave field features from moving vessels. \nIn the past different systems using nautical radars for measuring sea \nstates have been developed. This paper focuses on one of these devices, \nthe German system WaMoS II (Wave Monitoring System), which is \ndescribed in the following section.  \n2 The WaMoS II System \nWaMoS II is a high-speed video digitising and storage device that can be \ninterfaced to any conventional navigational X-band radar and a software \npackage running on a standard PC. The software controls the radar and \ndata storage. In addition, the WaMoS II software carries out the wave \nanalysis and displays the results (see Fig. 1). \nNautical Radar Measurements in Europe \u2013 WaMoS II      3 \nFig. 1. Schematic of the different parts of WaMoS II and the data flow from the \nradar antenna to the user display. \nThe system was developed at the German GKSS Research Centre and \nthe equipment was first tested in 1991. In 1994 the technology was trans-\nferred to OceanWaves GmbH in order to market and commercialise the \nsystem. Since then WaMoS II has been improved and expanded to cover \nship and shallow water applications. Since 2001 the system has been type \napproved by the Germanischer Lloyd and Det Norske Veritas. During sev-\neral applications WaMoS II proved to be a powerful tool to monitor ocean \nwaves from fixed platforms as well as from moving vessels, especially un-\nder extreme weather conditions (Young et al., 1985; Ziemer and Rosen-\nthal, 1987; Ziemer and G\u00fcnther, 1994; Nieto-Borge et al., 1999, Hessner et \nal., 2001).  \nA typical WaMoS II wave measurement consists of the acquisition of a \nradar image sequence and the subsequent wave analysis. The sea clutter \nimage sequence is transformed into the spectral domain by means of a \nthree dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). First the surface current \nis estimated from the image spectrum by means of a least-squares-method \nusing the dispersion relation for linear water waves as reference. Then the \ndispersion relation including the current component (Doppler) is used to \nfilter the image spectrum. Finally, by applying a modulation transfer func-\ntion the wave spectrum is determined. From this wave spectrum all kinds \n4      Katrin He\u00dfner, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Nieto-Borge and Paul S. Bell \nof commonly used types of wave spectra may be derived (wave number \nspectrum, frequency direction spectra, frequency spectra, etc) and various \nstandard spectral wave parameters can be inferred.  \nThe standard WaMoS II software delivers unambiguous directional \nwave spectra and time series of the integrated standard wave parameters \nsignificant wave height (Hs), peak wave period (Tp), peak wave direction \n(Tp) and peak wave length (Op) in real time. These data can be made avail-\nable to the user on the WaMoS II PC and can also be transferred to other \nstations via Internet, LAN, NMEA etc. \nRecent further developments allow WaMoS II to obtain sea surface ele-\nvation maps (Nieto-Borge et al., 2004), individual wave parameters (Rei-\nchert et al., 2005), wave groups (Dankert et al., 2003), the near surface cur-\nrent fields (Dankert et al., 2004), bathymetry (Bell 2005, Bell et al., 2005,  \nHessner et al., 1999), and high-resolution ocean wind fields [Dankert et al. \n,2005].\n3 Limits, Resolution, and Accuracies \nThe standard WaMoS II analysis uses a continuous sequence of 32 radar \nimages. Each radar image represents one antenna revolution. The sampling \ntime depends on the radar antenna rotation rate. Using standard radars with \nrotation rates ranging from 1.5-3 s, WaMoS II can detect waves in the \nrange of 0.025 Hz to 0.35 Hz. The actual range, resolution and accuracy \ncan vary for each WaMoS II installation, depending on the particular radar \nand set-up geometry. Table 1 shows typical values of standard output pa-\nrameters, corresponding resolution, and accuracies. \n4 Applications \nThis section describes some of the applications of the WaMoS II technol-\nogy for wave and current monitoring. For that purpose, two different loca-\ntions are described: The WaMoS II station at the FINO1 1 platform in the \nNorth Sea and an installation at Teignmouth located at the British coast. \nThese two locations have been selected because of the two different geo-\ngraphic and oceanographic conditions, as well as the specific application \n(e.g. FINO 1 station delivers wave field and meteorological information in \n                                                     \n1 FINO: Forschungsplattformen in Nordsee und Ostsee (Research Platforms in the \nNorth Sea and Baltic Sea) \nNautical Radar Measurements in Europe \u2013 WaMoS II      5 \nreal time and Teignmouth was a coastal station, which delivered bathym-\netry information from the analysis of the wave shoaling imaged by the ra-\ndar).\nTable 1.

The plat-\nform is located in the North Sea, approximately 45 km off the island of \nBorkum. The aim of the project is to record precise measurements of the \nmeteorological conditions in the lower atmospheric boundary layer. A \nWaMoS II was installed to investigate the load and stability of the struc-\nture due to surface waves and currents.  \nThe atmospheric and hydrographic measurements provide important in-\nput data for the design of offshore wind turbines and for improving atmos-\npheric and oceanographic models thereby forming the basis for the safe \nand economical operation of wind turbines on the open sea (Herklotz, \n2007). \n6      Katrin He\u00dfner, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Nieto-Borge and Paul S.

The first \nexample shows a bimodal sea state with a dominant wind sea (red) and \nsecondary swell (green). \nThe time series of Hs, Tp and Tp shown in Fig. 5 were obtained using the \nWaMoS II (red) and the Waverider buoy (blue) deployed next to the \nFINO 1 platform. A good agreement between the WaMoS II and the buoy \nmeasurements can be seen. Slight deviations can be expected, as WaMoS \nII delivers spatial mean wave parameters while the buoy delivers wave pa-\nrameters measured at a point.  \nNautical Radar Measurements in Europe \u2013 WaMoS II      7 \n(c\n)O\nce\nan\nW\nav\neS\nG\nm\nbH\n(2\n00\n7)\nN\nradar return\nno max\n1 km\nCurrent\n  0.1m\/s\nHs =    1.5m\nSwell: \nT  = 9.1s\n = 336\u00b0 \n = 120m\np\nT\nO\np\np\nWind sea:\n Tp = 6.2s\n   p = 300\u00b0\n     p = 60m\nT\nO\nHs = 1.5m\nN\nE\nS\nW\n 5.0 s\n 7.0 s\n10.0 s\n15.0 s\n0.10 0.20 0.30\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nE\nne\nrg\ny\n[m\nH\nz\n]\n2\n-1\nFig. 3.

Within the study a validation of radar derived \nbathymetry by means of echo sounder surveyed bathymetry was per-\nformed.  \nTeignmouth is a small town on a locally south-east facing coastline in \nthe south west of the UK, and the study area included a working port and \ntidal inlet to the Teign Estuary, a rocky headland and a length of straight \ngroined beach. The tidal inlet is surrounded by a complex system of sand \nbanks that evolve on a cyclic basis over the period of a few years. \nThe nautical radar was deployed on the shoreward end of Teignmouth \nPier, approximately in the middle of the study area. A tide gauge was lo-\ncated on the same pier, and echo sounder surveys were carried out at the \nstart and end of the experiment, but only to a distance of 1km offshore due \nto limits on the availability of the survey boat.  \n.\nNautical Radar Measurements in Europe \u2013 WaMoS II      9 \nFig. 6: The amalgamated bathymetry data for Teignmouth using one tidal \ncycle of hourly records. Radar derived bathymetric contours are shown in \nblack, with the contours from the echo sounder survey shown in white for \ncomparison. Depths are to Admiralty Chart Datum. \nSequences of 64 radar images with an antenna rotation rate of 2.4 sec-\nonds were recorded hourly during the deployment. Each image sequence \nwas processed to map the spatial distribution of wavelengths at a range of \nwave frequencies, and the water depth inferred using the best fit to a wave \ndispersion equation that includes a correction for the amplitude dispersion \nof finite amplitude waves in shallow water (Hedges, 1976). A set of these \nwater depth maps spanning one tidal cycle were corrected to be relative to \n10      Katrin He\u00dfner, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Nieto-Borge and Paul S. Bell \nchart datum using the tide gauge data and were averaged to give the amal-\ngamated bathymetry shown in Fig.6. The radar derived bathymetry is \nshown in colour with depth contours marked in black at 1m intervals. The \ncorresponding echo sounder survey contours are shown in white (Bell, \n2005). \nThe complex system of sand bars around the mouth of the inlet is \nclearly visible from the survey contours. The maximum depth at the limit \nof the echo sounder survey is approximately 8m, although the radar de-\nrived water depths extend to almost twice the range of the survey and show \nmaximum depths at this range of almost 14m. \nThe agreement between the depth contours of the radar derived bathym-\netry and the survey is excellent, particularly in this northern part of the \narea, with differences being on the order of centimeters. \nIt should be noted that to perform the echo sounder survey of the area \nrepresented by the white contours in Fig.6. required calm sea state condi-\ntions and approximately three days of ship time and man power. In con-\ntrast, the radar technology can produce a bathymetric map of almost dou-\nble that range during wave events using only a few minutes of radar data \nalthough with slightly lower spatial resolution and accuracy. \n5 Summary \nThe principles of sea state measurement using an X-band nautical radar \nhave been described. In addition, the Wave Monitoring System WaMoS II \nhas been also described giving some technical features and accuracies.  \nTwo examples for the use of nautical radar data were presented. The \nfirst example shows results of a standard sea state monitoring application \nat the platform FINO 1 in the German Bight. The second example shows \nresults of a deployment at Teignmouth in the UK with the objective of in-\nferring shallow water bathymetry by means of nautical radar images. \nThese two examples represent just a section of possible WaMoS II applica-\ntions and show that nautical radar is a reliable tool for monitoring wave \nfields and related phenomena, such as the wave shoaling due to variable \nbottom topography. \nNowadays about 40 WaMoS II systems have been installed on different \nplatforms at different locations world-wide. These installations include \nmoving vessels, coastal stations and off-shore platforms and use the capa-\nbilities of the WaMoS II for real time monitoring. The data from these sta-\ntions are mainly used to support safe off-shore and harbour operations and \nto provide weather services with sea state data.  \nNautical Radar Measurements in Europe \u2013 WaMoS II      11 \nAcknowledgements \nThe material presented for the Teighnmouth experiment was kindly pro-\nvide by Paul Bell from Proundman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool. \nThe work was carried out within the COAST3D project which was funded \nby the Marine Science and Technology (MAST) RTD programme of the \nEuropean Union under contract number MAS3-CT97-0086, and partly \nthrough national funding from the UK Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries \nand Food research project FD0803, the UK Environment Agency R&D \nProgramme, the UK Environment Research Council and the Netherlands \nRijkswaterstaat.
