We describe evidence that a large set of phenotypic traits exhibit diametrically opposite phenotypes in\nautistic-spectrum versus psychotic-spectrum conditions, with a focus on schizophrenia. This suite of traits is inter-correlated, in that\nautism involves a general pattern of constrained overgrowth, whereas schizophrenia involves undergrowth. These disorders also\nexhibit diametric patterns for traits related to social brain development, including aspects of gaze, agency, social cognition, local\nversus global processing, language, and behavior. Social cognition is thus underdeveloped in autistic-spectrum conditions and\nhyper-developed on the psychotic spectrum.\nWe propose and evaluate a novel hypothesis that may help to explain these diametric phenotypes: that the development of these two\nsets of conditions is mediated in part by alterations of genomic imprinting. Evidence regarding the genetic, physiological, neurological,\nand psychological underpinnings of psychotic-spectrum conditions supports the hypothesis that the etiologies of these conditions\ninvolve biases towards increased relative effects from imprinted genes with maternal expression, which engender a general pattern\nof undergrowth. By contrast, autistic-spectrum conditions appear to involve increased relative bias towards effects of paternally\nexpressed genes, which mediate overgrowth. This hypothesis provides a simple yet comprehensive theory, grounded in evolutionary\nbiology and genetics, for understanding the causes and phenotypes of autistic-spectrum and psychotic-spectrum conditions.\nKeywords: autism, cognition, genomic conflict, genomic imprinting, hyper-mentalism, psychosis, schizophrenia\nPeople divide roughly, it seems to me, into two kinds, or rather\na continuum is stretched between two extremes. There are\npeople people and things people.\n\u2014W.D. Hamilton (2005, p. 205)\n1. Introduction\nWe describe a new hypothesis that seeks to conceptually\nunify the analyses of psychosis and autism, two disorders\nof the human social brain (Burns 2004; 2006a; McAlonan\net al. 2005). The core of this hypothesis is that psychosis\nand autism represent two extremes on a cognitive spec-\ntrum with normality at its center. Social cognition is thus\nunderdeveloped in autism, but hyper-developed to dys-\nfunction in psychosis. We also suggest that these forms\nof deviation from normal social brain development in\neither direction are mediated in part by alterations in\ndevelopmental and metabolic systems affected by genomic\nimprinting, notably via effects of genes that are imprinted\nin the brain and in the placenta (Davies et al. 2005; Tycko\n&Morison 2002). Genomic imprinting involves a develop-\nmental and physiological tug-of-war, in the growing fetus\nand child, between the effects of paternally expressed\n(maternally \u201cimprinted,\u201d that is, maternally silenced)\nBERNARD CRESPI, Professor of Evolutionary Biology at\nSimon Fraser University, has authored more than 100\npublications and 4 books in the areas of social behavior,\nlife-history evolution, and evolutionary genetics. He\nconducted his doctoral work with William Hamilton\nand Richard Alexander at the University of Michigan,\nfollowed by postdoctoral studies at Oxford and\nCornell. Dr. Crespi has received the Theodosius Dobz-\nhansky Prize and the E. O. Wilson Award from the\nSociety for the Study of Evolution; and a Killam Fel-\nlowship from the Canada Council has allowed him to\napply his expertise to the evolution of human cognition\nand psychiatric disorders.\nCHRISTOPHER BADCOCK was born in 1946 and studied\nfor his first degree and Ph.D. at the London School of\nEconomics, where he is now a Reader in the Depart-\nment of Sociology. Following a private didactic analysis\nwith Anna Freud, he published a number of books and\npapers on Freud, evolutionary psychology, and gen-\netics, and is now completing a book on the wider impli-\ncations of the theory outlined in this paper. He is\nauthor of Evolutionary Psychology: A Critical Intro-\nduction (Polity Press, 2000), and currently teaches\ngraduate and undergraduate courses on evolution and\ngenetics.\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31, 241\u2013320\nPrinted in the United States of America\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004214\n# 2008 Cambridge University Press 0140-525X\/08 $40.00 241\ngenes, which favor enhanced growth as well as selfishness\nin interactions with the mother, and the effects of mater-\nnally expressed (paternally silenced) genes, which favor\nrelatively constrained growth and other traits that tend\nto benefit mothers (Haig 2000b; 2004b). Relatively small\ngenetic or epigenetic disruptions of this tug-of-war may\nincrease the fitness of the child or mother, respectively,\nas in some disorders of placentation mediated by dysregu-\nlated imprinting (Haig 1999b; Oudejans et al. 2004); but\nlarger alterations are pathological, and we hypothesize\nthat they contribute to the development of either autis-\ntic-spectrum disorders (due to a paternal-gene bias) or\npsychotic-spectrum disorders (due to a maternal-gene\nbias) via their effects on growth, neurodevelopment, cog-\nnition, and behavior.\nWe unpack our hypothesis by first providing a brief back-\nground on the social brain, and how its development is\naltered in autism and psychosis. Second, we provide an\noverview of genomic imprinting and explain Haig\u2019s\n(2000b; 2004b) \u201cconflict theory\u201d for how imprinting has\nevolved. Third, we describe our nosological framework for\nconceptualizing autistic-spectrum conditions and what we\ncall psychotic-spectrum conditions, and we explain how\nthe conflict theory of imprinting provides an evolutionary\nbasis for elucidating their genetic, epigenetic, and neurode-\nvelopmental causes. Fourth, we describe how Prader-Willi\nsyndrome and Angelman syndrome, which are caused\nby alterations of a region of chromosome 15 harboring\nimprinted genes, provide useful tests of the role of\nimprinted genes in autism and psychosis. Fifth, we contrast\nautistic-spectrum and psychotic-spectrum conditions for a\nwide range of anatomical, neurological, developmental,\ncognitive, behavioral, and epidemiological data. Our\nhypothesis predicts that to the degree that they represent\nopposite, generalized disorders, autistic- and psychotic-\nspectrum conditions should exhibit diametric phenotypes\nfor traits related to growth, development, and the social\nbrain. Finally, we develop a conceptual model for how sex\ndifferences interact with genomic-imprinting effects,\nwhich can help to explain some key features of autistic-\nand psychotic-spectrum epidemiology and symptoms.\nWe appreciate that autistic-spectrum and psychotic-\nspectrum conditions are each highly heterogeneous, with\nmyriad causes (Ronald et al. 2006; Ross et al. 2006a),\nand we are thus not proposing that these conditions are\ncaused in any exclusive sense by alterations to genomic\nimprinting. We also stress that describing an evolutionary\nframework for understanding autism and psychosis does\nnot in any way imply that these conditions should be con-\nsidered as adaptive, even though the autistic and psychotic\nspectrums each involve a pattern of specialized cognitive\nstrengths and impairments in relatively high-functioning\nindividuals (Claridge 1997; Mottron et al. 2006). Our\nmain goal instead is to integrate predictions from evo-\nlutionary theory and genetics with psychology, neuro-\nscience, and psychiatry, to further our understanding of\nthe major disorders of human cognition, affect, and\nbehavior.\n2. The social brain\nA key initial insight into human evolution was the idea that\nthe primary selective pressures shaping human cognitive\ndevelopment may be social rather than ecological\n(Emery 2000). This idea can be traced to Chance and\nMead (1953), Jolly (1966), Humphrey (1976; 1983), Alex-\nander (1989), and Brothers (1990), who have suggested\nthat living in large, complex groups, under strong within-\ngroup and between-group social competition for resources\nand mates, has selected for a \u201csocial brain,\u201d functionally\ndesigned by evolution mainly for solving social problems.\nRecent studies have described how early development\nof components of the social brain is impaired in autism,\nwhich may lead to a cascade of social deficits, and how\nmany of the core features of schizophrenia can also be\nunderstood in terms of dysregulation in multiple aspects\nof uniquely human social cognition (Arbib & Mundhenk\n2005; Baron-Cohen & Belmonte 2005; Benes & Berretta\n2001; Burns 2004; 2006a). These advances have suggested\nthat autism and schizophrenia are related to one another\nin some conceptual and etiological ways, because they\nboth involve alterations in recently evolved human social\nbehavior as central features (Burns 2006a). Although\nboth disorders can be conceived as dimensional, grading\nmore or less finely into normality (e.g., Frith & Happe\u00b4\n2005; see also, Hill & Frith 2003; Linney et al. 2003;\nSchu\u00a8rhoff et al. 2005), the relationship of autistic-\nspectrum conditions with schizophrenia, and other con-\nditions on the psychotic spectrum, has yet to be explicitly\ninvestigated in any detail. We do so here, in the context of\nevolutionary theory and genetics, with a focus on effects of\ngenomic imprinting.\n3. Genomic imprinting\nAnalysis of the social brain in contemporary neuroscience\nand psychology is yielding stunning insights into human\ncognition and psychiatric disorders. However, the concep-\ntual social brain is not yet an evolutionary brain, because it\nhas yet to fully incorporate central features of evolutionary\nbiology, such as inclusive fitness theory (Foster et al. 2006;\nHamilton 1964), intragenomic conflict (Burt & Trivers\n2006), social-behavioral ecology (e.g., Krebs & Davies\n1991), sex differences attributable to sex-differential selec-\ntive pressures (e.g., Andersson 1994), and the genomic\nbasis of recent human evolution (e.g., Crespi 2006;\nVoight et al. 2006). Each of these bodies of theory and\ndata has important implications for understanding the\nevolution of the human social brain, its developmental-\ngenetic underpinnings, and its dysregulation.\nInclusive fitness theory forms a cornerstone of biology, in\nexplaining how social interactions between genetically\nrelated individuals, such as mothers and offspring, have\nevolved (Alexander 1987; Hamilton 1964; Hrdy 1999).\nThis theory predicts that under any degree of multiple\npaternity, genes subject to imprinting whose phenotypic\neffects lead to offspring extracting relatively high levels of\nlimiting resources from mothers and other maternal kin\nare expected to be silenced in the maternal germ line\n(and thus paternally expressed in offspring) (Burt &\nTrivers 2006; Haig 2000b; 2004b). In turn, these effects\nshould be countered by selection for paternal silencing\n(and thus expression from only the maternally inherited\nchromosome) of genes whose phenotypic effects restrain\nthe transfer of mother\u2019s resources, bringing maternal invest-\nment towards her own optimum level. This conflict theory\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n242 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nfor the evolution and patterns of genomic imprinting has\nbeen supported by a large body of evidence on the func-\ntions and expression patterns of imprinted genes (Cattanach\net al. 2004; Haig 1996; 1999b; 2004a; 2004b; McMinn et al.\n2006; Plagge et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2006), and it provides a\nrobust theoretical framework for analyzing the roles of\nimprinted genes in human development and evolution.\nAlthough imprinted genes comprise only about 1% of the\ngenome, they are disproportionately involved in growth,\nespecially with regard to placental and brain development\nand function (Tycko &Morison 2002); they are highly pleio-\ntropic in their effects; and they can be dysregulated in more\nways than non-imprinted genes. Thus, imprinted-gene\nexpression can be affected by alterations in nucleotide\nsequence, by epigenetic variation (such as methylation\nand histone modification), by \u201cimprinter\u201d genes that regu-\nlate application, maintenance, and removal of imprints\n(Wilkins 2005), and by environmentally induced effects\non imprinted gene expression (Dolinoy et al. 2006).\nMost studies of genomic imprinting have focused on\ngenes expressed during prenatal and neonatal development,\nwhere conflict is manifested in aspects of maternal\u2013fetal\ninteractions during placentation and neonatal growth\n(Angiolini et al. 2006; Crespi & Semeniuk 2004; Haig\n1993; 1996; 2004a; 2004b). The placenta has evolved as a\nfocal point for genomic conflict due to its function in the\ntransfer of resources between mutually dependent individ-\nuals that bear genes with partially divergent inclusive fitness\ninterests (Coan et al. 2005; Haig 1993; 1996). Many of the\ncommon disorders of pregnancy, including gestational dia-\nbetes, pre-eclampsia, and fetal growth restriction, arise in\npart from breakdowns in the dynamically balanced, \u201ctug-\nof-war\u201d nature of physiological systems subject to\nmaternal\u2013fetal conflict and imprinting effects (Cattanach\net al. 2004; Haig 1993; 1996; 1999b; McMinn et al. 2006;\nOudejans et al. 2004; Reik et al. 2003).\nA considerable proportion of known imprinted genes are\nexpressed exclusively or predominantly in the brain, where\nthey influence aspects of behavior (Curley et al. 2004;\nDavies et al. 2001; 2005; 2006; Isles et al. 2006; Keverne\n2001a; 2001b). The brain can be conceived as analogous\nto the placenta in that both organs mediate the transfer of\nfitness-limiting resources in networks of kin (Badcock &\nCrespi 2006). As in the case of placentation, disruption in\nsystems involving brain-expressed imprinted genes can\nlead to major neurological and physiological disorders\n(Badcock 2000; Davies et al. 2001; Haig & Wharton 2003;\nIsles et al. 2006). Developmental systems regulated by\nimprinting effects are unusual in that they can be disrupted\nin two diametrically opposed ways, towards either paternal-\ngene or maternal-gene bias. Disorders affected by imprint-\ning should thus exhibit diametric phenotypes, as seen\nclearly, for example, in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\ninvolving overgrowth versus the Silver-Russell undergrowth\nsyndrome (Cerrato et al. 2005; Eggermann et al. 2005;\n2006). We propose that such diametric effects extend to\nbrain and behavior, and these effects help to account for\nsome of the major features of human cognitive architecture.\n4. The imprinted brain\nIn 2002, Badcock proposed that insights from autism\nresearch suggest that we have evolved two parallel cognitive\nsystems, which he termed mentalistic and mechanistic cog-\nnition (see Badcock 2004). Mentalistic cognition (or simply\nmentalism, otherwise know as theory of mind, folk psychol-\nogy, or mentalizing) evolved for interaction with other\npeople in a psychological environment, whereas mechanis-\ntic cognition ( folk physics) evolved in parallel for inter-\naction with the physical environment (for a comparable\nview, see Kuhlmeier et al. 2004). Badcock also proposed\nthat if, as is generally accepted, many symptoms of autism\ncan be seen in terms of deficits in functions such as gaze-\nmonitoring, intentionality, shared attention, and theory of\nmind in general (Baron-Cohen 1995), then some common\nsymptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, such as delusions of\nbeing watched or spied on, erotomania or delusions of per-\nsecution, conspiratorial delusions, and religious and magical\ndelusions, could be seen as pathologically hypertrophied\nequivalents, or in general terms as hyper-mentalism\n(Badcock 2004; see also Abu-Akel 1999; Abu-Akel &\nBailey 2000 for supporting views). Badcock and Crespi\n(2006) suggested that evolutionary and genetic foundations\nof autismmight be found in some combination of enhanced\nexpression of paternally active genes and reduced\nexpression of maternally active ones in brain development\nand behavior (Badcock & Crespi 2006). Here, we extend\nthese basic insights by showing how the two extremes of\nthe mechanistic-mentalistic continuum \u2013 what we call\nautistic- and psychotic-spectrum conditions \u2013 can be rep-\nresented as diametric opposites for a large suite of phenoty-\npic traits, with the diametric nature understood in terms of\nthe two possible directions, paternal and maternal, for\nimbalances in imprinted gene effects. The cognitive and\nbehavioral effects of such imbalances are most clear for\nknown syndromes mediated by imprinting effects, but\ncan, we contend, be generalized and extended to major dis-\norders of the social brain.\n4.1. Autistic-spectrum conditions\nAutism is a spectrum of conditions, all of which involve\nsome combination of impairments in social interaction;\nlanguage and communication; and repetitive, restricted\nbehaviors or interests (Happe\u00b4 et al. 2006). This spectrum\nincludes Kanner (infantile) autism, Asperger syndrome,\nand a set of other conditions including Rett syndrome\n(LaSalle et al. 2005), Fragile X syndrome (Belmonte &\nBourgeron 2006), and Turner syndrome (Skuse 2005),\nall of which involve autistic features in a substantial pro-\nportion of affected individuals. Conti-Ramsden et al.\n(2006), Herbert and Kenet (2007), and Smith (2007) also\ndescribe close links between autism and Specific\nLanguage Impairment, and obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD) may exhibit a closer association with the autistic\nspectrum than with the psychotic spectrum (Abramson\net al. 2005; Bejerot 2007; Bu\u00a8rgy 2007; Fineberg et al.\n2007). We have therefore conceptualized the autistic spec-\ntrum in terms of its three main criteria and their main\ncomponent phenotypes (Fig. 1), showing that these cri-\nteria partially overlap in their phenotypic expression, and\nby implication in their genetic underpinnings (Happe\u00b4\net al. 2006). By our hypothesis for the phenotypic structure\nof autistic conditions, at the core of these features we find\na reduction in mentalistic cognition, affect, and beha-\nvior \u2013 a relatively underdeveloped social brain.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 243\nPrevious theory for understanding the evolutionary and\ndevelopmental bases of autism has focused on sex differ-\nences and how they relate to autistic phenotypes. Asperger\n(1991) thus suggested that \u201cthe autistic personality is an\nextreme variant of male intelligence,\u201d and Baron-Cohen\n(2002; 2003) has developed this idea into an \u201cextreme\nmale brain\u201d theory of autism, which posits that the\nprimary differences between autistic and normal cognition\nparallel the differences between the sexes. By this theory,\nautism can be \u201cexplained psychologically by an impaired\ncapacity for empathizing, or modeling the mental states\ngoverning the behavior of people, along with a superior\ncapacity for systemizing, or inferring the rules governing\nthe behavior of objects\u201d (Baron-Cohen & Belmonte\n2005, p. 109; see also Baron-Cohen 2002; Baron-Cohen\net al. 2005). This hypothesis is consistent with a large\nbody of evidence, including (1) a male-biased sex ratio in\nautism; (2) enhanced empathy, better ability to detect\nemotions, and faster language development in girls,\nwhereas boys show increased ability and interests in activi-\nties related to systemizing (Baron-Cohen 2002; Baron-\nCohen et al. 2005; McClure et al. 2004); (3) links\nbetween higher prenatal exposure to testosterone and\nautistic traits (Knickmeyer et al. 2005; Lutchmaya et al.\n2002a; 2002b); and (4) higher scores for males on a test\ncharacterizing individuals along an autistic spectrum\n(Baron-Cohen et al. 2001; 2005).\nBadcock and Crespi (2006) have described genetic,\nneurological, and behavioral evidence relevant to the\nhypothesis that important aspects of autism may represent\nnot the extreme male brain per se, but rather the extreme\npaternally biased imprinted brain. Thus, autism dispropor-\ntionately involves imbalances in development that lead to\nincreased effects of paternally expressed genes at loci\nsubject to imprinting, relative to maternally expressed\nones. Such paternally expressed genes are expected to\ndrive development and cognition towards a more\nresource-demanding phenotype, similar to a phenotype\ngenerally more characteristic of males than females\n(Badcock & Crespi 2006). The imprinted brain theory for\nautism is consistent with Baron-Cohen\u2019s body of evidence,\nbut it can also help explain other key features of autism,\nsuch as the much more male-biased sex ratio in Asperger\nsyndrome and high-functioning autism than in severe,\nKanner autism (Folstein & Rosen-Sheidley 2001), and the\nobservation that many factors other than sex and fetal tes-\ntosterone are involved. Evidence for epigenetic dysregula-\ntion of imprinted genes in autism is also reviewed by\nSchanen (2006).\nBadcock and Crespi (2006) also describe how some\ncentral aspects of the autistic spectrum may be explained\nby their hypothesis. Thus, extreme deficits in the so-\ncalled maternal brain (mainly the highly developed neo-\ncortex) (Keverne 2001a) but more or less normal function\nof the paternal brain (mainly the limbic system), may lead\nto the loss of language, mental retardation, and repetitive\nbehavior typical of infantile (Kanner) autism, whereas\nincreased paternal-brain effects, but relatively spared\nmaternal-brain function, may lead to high-functioning\nautism or Asperger syndrome, which involves specific\ndeficits in social cooperation and reciprocity (Badcock &\nCrespi 2006; Constantino & Todd 2005; Fitzgerald 2004,\npp. 30\u201341; Rinehart et al. 2002a). In both cases, autism\nresults in part from disrupted tension between neurode-\nvelopmental and physiological agents of intragenomic\nconflict. As for imprinted gene effects in placental dis-\norders and carcinogenesis (e.g., Angiolini et al. 2006;\nLee 2003; McMinn et al. 2006), the resulting phenotype\nis more or less pathological, but the nature of the devi-\nation from normality provides insight into its underlying\ngenomic, physiological, and evolutionary causes. The\nmain phenotypic feature of autism that may reflect the\nconflict theory of genomic imprinting is that autism\ninvolves increased \u201cself-oriented\u201d and indeed \u201cselfish\u201d\nbehavior, expressed most clearly as deficits of cooperative\nsocial behavior and augmentation of mechanistic cogni-\ntion (Badcock 2004; Badcock & Crespi 2006). We use\nthe term mechanistic (rather than systemizing) cognition\nbecause mechanistic refers more generally to the physical\nworld, including aspects of sensation; cause\u2013effect infer-\nence; mechanistic relationships of child with mother\n(Kanner 1949); and bottom-up, non-abstract, less cen-\ntrally coherent processing of information (Vermeulen\n2001, p. 28).\n4.2. Psychotic-spectrum conditions\nPsychosis is literally a disordering of the psyche, the Greek\n\u201csoul.\u201d In schizophrenia, such disordering commonly\ninvolves delusions and auditory hallucinations, loss of\ncoherence and logic in thought and discourse, and\nFigure 1. The autistic spectrum can be visualized in terms of\nthree suites of traits that partially overlap in their phenotypic\nexpression and genetic underpinnings, with each suite of traits\ngrading more or less smoothly into each other and into\nnormality. At the core of the autistic spectrum we find a\nreduction in mentalistic cognition, affect, and behavior, which\ncan be mediated by effects on the development of social\nreciprocity, language and communication, and restrictive\ninterests and activities, or by some combination of effects from\nthese three domains. Recent studies suggest that the degree of\ngenetic and phenotypic overlap between these three domains\nof the autistic spectrum appears similar in magnitude to the\noverlap between the three main conditions characterizing the\npsychotic spectrum, which are shown in Figure 2.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n244 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nemotionality (affect) externally reduced or inappropriate to\nsocial context (Tamminga &Holcomb 2005). Auditory hal-\nlucinations, a primary symptom found in over 60% of\npersons diagnosed with schizophrenia, are also common\nin persons with bipolar disorder or major depression\n(Baethge et al. 2005; Kempf et al. 2005; 2007; Tsuang\net al. 2004), as well as in non-clinical settings (Bentall\n2003a). Bipolar disorder and major depression often\ninvolve other psychotic symptoms such as delusions, as\nwell as symptoms related to dysregulated emotionality\n(Boks et al. 2007b). Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and\nmajor depression thus exhibit broad phenotypic overlap,\nas shown in Figure 2; and they also partially overlap in\ntheir polygenic underpinnings (Blackwood et al. 2007;\nCraddock & Forty 2006; Potash 2006; Van Den Bogaert\net al. 2006). These so-called psychotic-spectrum con-\nditions also include schizotypy (Claridge 1997), Klinefelter\nsyndrome (Boks et al. 2007a), velocardiofacial syndrome\n(Feinstein et al. 2002), and dyslexia (Condray 2005), all\nof which exhibit a notably elevated incidence of schizo-\nphrenia or affective psychosis, or a suite of physiological\nand neurological phenotypes characteristic of these con-\nditions. We have conceptualized schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, and major depression as exhibiting partial\noverlap in their phenotypic features, with psychosis and\nhyper-mentalistic cognition, affect, and behavior at their\ncore (Fig. 2).\nLike autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major\ndepression each grades more or less smoothly from dis-\norder into normality (Claridge 1997; Happe\u00b4 et al. 2006).\nEach of these conditions also exhibits a strong genetic\ncomponent to its expression, but with many genes involved\nand different combinations of these genes underlying the\nphenotypes involved (Rapoport et al. 2005; Tamminga &\nHolcomb 2005). Psychosis in schizophrenia, bipolar dis-\norder, major depression, and schizotypy involves so-\ncalled positive, first-rank symptoms, which mainly include\nmagical ideation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoia,\nthought disorder, and referential thinking. Such positive\nsymptoms comprise a much higher proportion of the\ngenetic liability to schizophrenia and schizotypy than do\nnegative symptoms (Kremen et al. 1998; Vollema et al.\n2002; Yaralian et al. 2000), and positive and negative symp-\ntoms appear to be independently heritable to a consider-\nable degree (Fanous et al. 2001; Linney et al. 2003).\nA logical consequence of the imprinted-brain hypo-\nthesis for the etiology of autism is that the converse dis-\nruption, towards stronger relative effects of maternally\nexpressed imprinted genes, should also involve altered\ngrowth, development, and cognition. We describe evi-\ndence here that this direction of disrupted imprinting rep-\nresents a contributing cause in the development of\npsychotic-spectrum conditions. By contrast with autism,\nimbalances towards increased effects of maternally\nexpressed imprinted genes, or reduced effects from pater-\nnally expressed imprinted genes, should engender changes\nin physiology, morphology, and behavior that can be con-\nstrued as more or less pathological manifestations of\neffects that are normally beneficial to mothers and other\nmaternal relatives (Haig 2000a; 2000b; 2003; 2004b).\nOur hypothesis is focused primarily on explaining phe-\nnotypes involved in psychosis, as these represent central\ntraits exhibited in schizophrenia, schizotypy, bipolar dis-\norder, and major depression (Fig. 2) (Crow 2004a;\n2004b; 2004c; Keverne 1999). Negative symptoms such\nas social withdrawal, perseveration, apathy, and flat\naffect \u2013 as seen mainly in \u201cdeficit\u201d schizophrenia \u2013 appar-\nently involve a relatively large element of major neurophy-\nsiological pathology (such as grey matter loss) as well as\naltered function (e.g., Chua et al. 1997; Frith 1992).\nSuch symptoms have been used as evidence for \u201cautism\u201d\nor \u201cautistic traits\u201d in schizophrenia, velocardiofacial syn-\ndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome (Frith & Frith 1991;\nNylander & Gillberg 2001; Sheitman et al. 2004;\nVeltman et al. 2004; 2005; Vorstman et al. 2006), but in\neach case these inferences of similarity have been based\nentirely on observation or data from questionnaires, inter-\nviews, scales, or checklists. By contrast, biological criteria,\nincluding neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and genetics,\ndemonstrate notable similarities of velocardiofacial syn-\ndrome, Klinefelter syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome\nwith disorders on the psychotic spectrum, especially\nschizophrenia (e.g., DeLisi et al. 2005; Eliez 2007;\nEliez & van Amelsvoort 2005; Holsen & Thompson\n2004; Lee et al. 2005).\nThe most useful information for evaluating our hypo-\nthesis comes from the relatively non-pathological points\non the salient cognitive spectra: For autism, this is Asper-\nger syndrome, high-functioning autism, and non-clinical\nindividuals with autistic traits; and for psychosis, this is\nmanifested most clearly in \u201chealthy schizotypy\u201d (Claridge\n1997). However, we will consider all traits and conditions\non the psychotic spectrum as potentially amenable to some\ndegree of falsifiable explication by our hypothesis. Thus,\nFigure 2. The psychotic spectrum can be visualized in terms of\nthree main conditions \u2013 schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and\nmajor depression \u2013 that grade into one another and exhibit\npartial overlap in their phenotypic expression and genetic\nunderpinnings. These three conditions have historically been\nconsidered as largely separate, but recent genetic studies, and\nconsideration of intermediate conditions, have demonstrated\nthat they share a broad range of features and risk factors. At\nthe core of the three conditions we find hyper-development in\naspects of mentalistic cognition, affect and behavior, especially\npsychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 245\nby analogy with hypothesized Kevernian maternal-brain\nand paternal-brain effects in autistic conditions (Badcock &\nCrespi 2006), negative symptoms of schizophrenia and\ndepression such as anhedonia, loss of will, flat affect, and\npsychomotor retardation may be associated with relatively\ndecreased paternal-brain influences and a maternal brain\nthat is either relatively unaffected, or that sends hyper-\nmentalistic outputs to the limbic system (e.g., paranoia eli-\nciting fear, or feelings of guilt imposing anhedonia). In\ncomparison, positive symptoms appear to be more a con-\nsequence of increased maternal-brain influences on cogni-\ntion and behavior, with the paternal brain relatively\nunaltered.\nAs autism involves traits characteristic of an \u201cextreme\nmale brain\u201d (Baron-Cohen et al. 2005), we predict that,\nin comparison, psychotic-spectrum disorders should\nreflect neuroanatomy, cognition, and behavior that are\nrelatively more characteristic of females. We stress that\nthe male\u2013female axis, and the phenotypic axis defined\nby effects of paternally versus maternally expressed\nimprinted genes, are not the same: Both sexes exhibit\neffects from brain-expressed imprinted genes, and sex\ndifferences are driven by selection in diverse contexts.\nBut the axes overlap; they may share mechanisms of devel-\nopment, and, as described later, the way that these axes\ninteract may help to explain sex biases in the incidence\nand some major features of autistic- and psychotic-spec-\ntrum conditions.\n5. Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes\nPrader-Willi and Angelman syndromes result from oppo-\nsite disruptions (usually deletions or duplications) of a\nsuite of imprinted genes on chromosome 15. Prader-\nWilli syndrome is caused by the downstream develop-\nmental effects of imbalance towards increased relative\nexpression of maternal genes in this region, and Angelman\nsyndrome is due to imbalance towards less maternal\ngene expression (Bittel & Butler 2005; Dan & Boyd\n2003; Whittington et al. 2004; Yamasaki et al. 2003).\nBoth syndromes have major impacts on cognition, beha-\nvior, and psychopathology, and as a result, they provide\nuseful tests of our hypothesis. If our hypothesis is\ncorrect, then Prader-Willi syndrome should involve\nincreased rates of psychosis, and Angelman syndrome\nshould involve a high incidence of autism. The power of\nsuch predictions is tempered primarily by the large magni-\ntude of the perturbations that cause these syndromes:\nReducing levels of imprinted gene expression to zero or\ndoubling them (Bittel & Butler 2005) probably leads to\nany number of purely pathological effects that may not\nbe clearly indicative of the nature of the disrupted adap-\ntive systems.\nThe phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome can be\ndivided into two main life-history stages. Prior to the\nusual age of weaning, this syndrome involves lack of appe-\ntite, poor suckling ability, a weak cry, inactivity, and sleepi-\nness; by contrast, after this age, it involves extreme and\nunselective overeating (Dykens et al. 2000; Holland et al.\n2003; Whittington & Holland 2004). Haig and Wharton\n(2003) have suggested that these features of Prader-Willi\nsyndrome reflect an extreme manifestations of traits that\nbenefit the mother by making the baby less demanding\non her resources, both before weaning (when food\nintake and energetic demands are reduced) and after\nweaning (when ingestion of any solid food available may\nease provisioning). Prader-Willi syndrome also involves\nlow birth weight and growth hormone deficiency (Gillessen-\nKaesbach et al. 1995; Goldstone 2004), which are consist-\nent with increased relative developmental effects from\nmaternally expressed imprinted genes.\nPrader-Willi syndrome engenders a very high incidence\nof psychosis in adulthood (Verhoeven et al. 2003; Vogels\net al. 2003; 2004). Such psychosis is found predominantly\nin cases of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) (with 61%\nof individuals exhibiting symptoms) compared to deletion\n(17%) (Soni et al. 2007). The genetic differences between\ndisomy and deletion include: (a) higher expression levels\nof maternally expressed genes in disomy, for genes in\nthe PWS region; (b) haploinsufficiency of non-imprinted\ngenes in this region, in deletion cases; and (c) loss of\nexpression, in disomy, of any paternally expressed genes\non chromosome 15 outside the Prader-Willi region (Bittel\net al. 2003; Whittington et al. 2004). Thus, the UPD geno-\ntype exhibits a greater deviation towards increased relative\nexpression of maternal genes. Biological similarities between\nPrader-Willi syndrome and psychotic-spectrum conditions\ninclude enlarged ventricles (Miller et al. 2007), altered ser-\notoninergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission patterns\n(Akefeldt et al. 1998; Holsen & Thompson 2004), impaired\nstereopsis (Chen et al. 2005; Fox et al. 1999), and a high pain\nthreshold (Kuwako et al. 2005; Singh et al. 2006). Lee et al.\n(2005) postulated that \u201cPrader-Willi syndrome is one of\nan emerging class of neurodevelopmental disorders that\nincludes BBS [Bardet-Biedl syndrome], schizophrenia,\nand lissencephaly, which are in part caused by defects in\ncentrosome function in cytoskeletal rearrangement during\nneurite extension\u201d (p. 628). Neuroanatomically, Prader-\nWilli syndrome is apparently mediated by impaired devel-\nopment of the hypothalamus (Goldstone 2004), the neuro-\nlogical nexus of the paternal brain.\nVeltman et al. (2004; 2005) discuss the presence of\nautistic symptoms in Prader-Willi syndrome, which pri-\nmarily involves obsessive behaviors and deficits in social\ninteraction (e.g., social withdrawal), with language abilities\nlargely intact. Such symptoms are about twice as common\nin uniparental disomy than deletion cases (Veltman et al.\n2005), which is consistent with an alternative interpre-\ntation of these patterns as indicating expected aspects of\na personality \u201cpremorbid\u201d for schizophrenia, a condition\nwhich involves notable deficits in social and language\ndevelopment (Cannon et al. 1997; Sporn et al. 2004a;\nVourdas et al. 2003). More generally, childhood diagnoses\nof autism in individuals with neurogenetic syndromes\nshowing greatly increased rates of psychotic-spectrum dis-\norders in adulthood, such as Klinefelter syndrome (Boks\net al. 2007a; DeLisi et al. 2005; Jha et al. 2007) and velo-\ncardiofacial syndrome (Antshel et al. 2007; Gothelf 2007;\nVorstman et al. 2006) may represent \u201cfalse positives\u201d\n(Feinsten & Singh 2007), motivated by superficial child-\nhood similarities between autism and \u201cpremorbid\u201d psycho-\ntic-spectrum conditions (Eliez 2007) that are not\nunderlain by genetic, neurological, or other biological cri-\nteria. Such considerations also apply to diagnoses of atypi-\ncal autism in childhood, which Mouridsen et al. (2008)\nfound to be followed in adulthood by diagnoses of \u201cschizo-\nphrenia spectrum disorders\u201d in 31 (35%) of 89 cases.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n246 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nSymptoms of Angelman syndrome in childhood include\nprolonged suckling, frequent laughter, hyperactivity, and\nfrequent waking (Badcock 2000; Cohen et al. 2005; Wil-\nliams et al. 2006a). As in severe cases of autism, speech\nis often absent (Holm et al. 1993). Angelman syndrome\nalso exhibits a disproportionately high rate of autistic\ntraits that include deficits in reciprocal social behavior,\npoor eye contact, intolerance to change, and repetitive\nand stereotyped behaviors (Cohen et al. 2005; Peters\net al. 2004; Schroer et al. 1998; Trillingsgaard & \u00d8ster-\ngaard 2004). Peters et al. (2004) found that 42% of Angel-\nman children in a long-term study met DSM-IV criteria\nfor autism, and Sahoo et al. (2006) diagnosed 48% as autis-\ntic, with a higher frequency (80%) in cases of the larger,\n\u201cType 1\u201d deletion at 15q11-q13. Angelman syndrome\nalso involves mildly increased body weight in early child-\nhood in three of the classes of genetic alteration that\ncause it (paternal UPD15, imprinting center alteration,\nand UBE3A mutation), as well as in some mouse models\n(Johnstone et al. 2006; Lossie et al. 2001). Further biologi-\ncal evidence for similarities between Angelman syndrome\nand autism includes high rates of seizures, an epileptiform\nEEG (electroencephalogram), and ataxia in both con-\nditions (Williams et al. 2006a); genetic associations of\nUBE3A alleles with autism (Nurmi et al. 2001); and\ngenetic models that posit a strong role for UBE3A dysre-\ngulation in autism (Jiang et al. 2004). An important con-\ntrast is macrocephaly in autism (Lainhart et al. 2006;\nStanfield et al., in press), but acquired microcephaly in\nAngelman syndrome.\nTaken together, the high rates of autistic-spectrum traits\nin Angelman syndrome, and psychotic-spectrum traits in\nPrader-Willi syndrome, suggest that diametric dysregulation\nof imprinted genes \u2013 towards increased paternal and\nmaternal expression, respectively \u2013 mediates the expression\nof diametric behavioral and psychiatric phenotypes. By\nour hypothesis, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syn-\ndrome should also show autistic features, and Silver-Russell\nsyndrome should involve traits relatively characteristic of the\npsychotic spectrum.\n6. Diametric phenotypes of psychosis and autism\nThe term autism was originally coined by Bleuler in the\ncontext of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and\nKanner (1965) struggled to establish autism as a disorder\nseparate from childhood-onset schizophrenia until Kolvin\u2019s\n(1971) classic study showing bimodality in timing of onset\nfor \u201cchildhood psychosis.\u201d The comorbidity of autism and\nschizophrenia is apparently low (Gousse\u00b4 et al. 2002).\nLeyfer et al. (2006) found no comorbid cases in a sample\nof 109 autistics, but they were ages 5\u201317, so few cases\nwould be expected. (By contrast, depression, attention-\ndeficit\/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], and obsessive-com-\npulsive disorder [OCD] were markedly elevated.) Volkmar\nand Cohen (1991) reported one case of schizophrenia in\n163 adolescent and adult autistic individuals, which is at\nor below the general prevalence of about 1% in the\noverall population. Stahlberg et al. (2004) analyzed 129\nadults (mean age 32) with autistic-spectrum disorders,\nand found no schizophrenia in 13 cases of autism, 1 case\nof schizophrenia, and 5 cases of \u201cother psychotic disorder\u201d\nin 49 Asperger syndrome cases, and 3 cases of\nschizophrenia and 1 case of \u201cother psychotic disorder\u201d in\n67 cases of PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder\nnot otherwise specified). This latter association is of ques-\ntionable salience to the hypothesis, given that Sporn et al.\n(2004a) have described a high incidence of PDD-NOS\nassociated with later-onset schizophrenia.\nThe main complications of interpreting comorbidity\nstudies are that apparent Asperger syndrome cases may\ninvolve \u201cautistic\u201d features expressed in some negative symp-\ntoms of schizophrenia and schizotypy (Konstantareas &\nHewitt 2001; Goldstein et al. 2002); the lack of communi-\ncation skills in Kanner autism may make diagnosis of psy-\nchosis problematic; the presence of psychotic symptoms\nformally excludes an autism diagnosis by DSM criteria;\nand childhood \u201cautism\u201d may represent premorbidity for\nschizophrenia, as described earlier.\nOne of the strongest predictions of our hypothesis follows\nfrom the diametric nature of disruptions to systems affected\nby imprinted genes. Thus, the suite of phenotypic traits that\ncharacterize autistic- and psychotic-spectrum conditions\nshould exhibit patterns of symmetrical and opposite pheno-\ntypes for traits related to growth and development, as well\nas aspects of social cognition and behavior. In this section,\nwe describe evidence from studies of growth, development,\nneuroanatomy, cognition, behavior, and epidemiology for\ndiametric phenotypes in autism and psychosis (Table 1).\nWe focus on the most recent studies and comprehensive\nreviews, and we encourage neuroscientists, psychiatrists,\nand psychologists to consider the evidence as a convergent\nwhole, constructively engage the core arguments and pre-\ndictions, and suggest alternative possible explanations for\nthe patterns that we describe.\n6.1. Growth and neuroanatomy\n6.1.1. Brain size, birth weight, growth, and placen-\ntation. Whole brain size is reduced in schizophrenia\nfrom birth onwards (Cannon et al. 2002; Gur et al. 2007;\nMcIntosh et al. 2006; Tamminga & Holcomb 2005), due\nto reductions in grey matter (neuronal tissue) (e.g., Narr\net al. 2005; Woods et al. 2005), reduced and altered\nwhite matter (mainly brain fatty acids) (e.g., Kieseppa\u00a8\net al. 2003; McDonald et al. 2004; 2005), and lower cortical\nthickness (Goghari et al. 2007; Kuperberg et al. 2003).\nMoises et al. (2002) also noted that a considerable range\nof growth deficiencies, including low birth weight, late\nmaturation, and small brain size, are found in schizo-\nphrenia. Reduced brain size may be due in part to slow\nbrain maturation in individuals who develop psychosis\n(Crow 1995; Crow et al. 1996; James et al. 1999; Saugstad\n1998; 1999).\nIn autism, cortical thickness is increased (Hardan et al.\n2006), and increased head and brain size is one of the most\nconsistent anatomical findings across studies (DiCicco-\nBloom et al. 2006; Dissanayake et al. 2006; Lainhart\net al. 2006; Stanfield et al., in press). In autism, brain\nsize undergoes a striking growth spurt between birth and\nage four (Cody et al. 2002; Courchesne & Pierce 2005a;\n2005b; Courchesne et al. 2004; Herbert 2005; Lainhart\net al. 2006; Penn 2006; Redcay & Courchesne 2005), an\nacceleration driven differentially by increases in (metabo-\nlically expensive) white matter volume (Herbert et al.\n2004; Lainhart 2006; see also McAlonan et al. 2002).\nRemarkably, a recent study of Asperger syndrome\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 247\nTable 1.

Thus, autism can\ninvolve higher birth weight compared to controls (Mraz\net al. 2007; Sacco et al. 2007; Sugie et al. 2005) and faster\nbody growth (Dissanayake et al. 2006; Fukumoto et al.\n2008; Mraz et al. 2007), although some studies report a\nlack of birth weight difference (Cederlund & Gillberg\n2004; Juul-Dam et al. 2001; Larsson et al. 2005) or lower\nbirth weight in autism (Kolevzon et al. 2007). By contrast,\nschizophrenia and major depression entail lower weight at\nbirth with considerable consistency across studies\n(Cannon et al. 2002; Costello et al. 2007; Gale & Martyn\n2004; Gunnell & Holly 2004; Niemi et al. 2005; Nilsson\net al. 2005; Wahlbeck et al. 2001a). Imprinted genes are\nknown to exert strong effects on birth weight and child-\nhood weight in humans (Gorlova et al. 2003; Lindsay\net al. 2002), and Svensson et al. (2006) have demonstrated\nfamilial aggregation of low birth weight, with effects from\nmaternal, paternal, and fetal genes. The clearest evidence\nfor enhanced growth in autism comes from Mills et al.\n(2007), who reported significantly increased head size,\nbody weight, body mass index, and levels of growth hor-\nmones (including the key, paternally expressed growth\nfactor IGF2) in autistic children compared to normal con-\ntrols. Diametric patterns of growth can also help to explain\nthe higher incidence of schizophrenia than autism, given\nthat there should be many more genetic, epigenetic, and\nenvironmental ways to disrupt and reduce growth than\nto increase it. We also note that genomic conflicts and\nstrong selection may contribute to the high heritabilities\nof autism and schizophrenia via such processes as anta-\ngonistic pleiotropy, evolutionary disequilibrium, and\nincreased scope for mutation-selection balance via disrup-\ntion of developmental tugs-of-war (Crespi 2006; Crespi\net al. 2007).\nFetal development is critically dependent upon placen-\ntation, which in humans is highly invasive and has evolved\nin the context of constrained maternal\u2013fetal conflict (Haig\n1993). Anderson et al. (2007) recently described a highly\nsignificant, three-fold increase in placental inclusions in\nautism. Such inclusions are caused by increased prolifera-\ntive growth of cytotrophoblast, the stem-cell-like com-\nponent of the placenta. Placental inclusions are also\nfound disproportionately in Beckwith-Wiedemann syn-\ndrome and hydatiform moles (molar pregnancies involving\nplacental overgrowth), both of which represent disorders\nof genomic imprinting that involve excessive effects from\npaternal gene expression (Devriendt 2005; Fisher et al.\n2002; Ohama et al. 1986; Saxena et al. 2003). Placental\ndevelopment in general is strongly regulated by imprinted\ngenes, with paternally expressed genes favoring increased\nplacental growth (Dunger et al. 2006; Fowden et al. 2006;\nMcMinn et al. 2006; Reik et al. 2003).\nRisk of schizophrenia decreases with increased placen-\ntal weight (Wahlbeck et al. 2001a). Intrauterine growth\nrestriction, which is caused predominantly by placental\nunderdevelopment and engenders increased fetal hypoxia\n(Gagnon 2003), is also a strong risk factor for schizo-\nphrenia (Abel & Allin 2006; Cannon et al. 2000; Rees &\nInder 2005). Effects of fetal hypoxia on brain development\nare also indicated by experiments in rats that link hypoxia\nwith altered lateralization of the dopaminergic system\n(Brake et al. 2000). Finally, in humans, monozygotic\ntwin concordance for schizophrenia is much higher\nwhen the twins share a placenta (60%), than when they\ndo not (11%) (Davis et al. 1995). Abel (2004) describes\nadditional evidence that fetal growth restriction, mediated\nby imprinting effects, contributes to the development of\nschizophrenia.\nPlacentation is crucial to brain development, and it rep-\nresents a key arena for imprinted-gene conflict, because\nfetal brain growth, especially deposition of fatty acids, is\none of the most metabolically costly processes during\npregnancy, as well as exerting severe energetic costs in\nearly postnatal development (Foley & Lee 1991; Herrera\n2002; Kuzawa 1998). Mothers bear virtually all of these\ncosts, and indeed, during the late stages of pregnancy\nmothers metabolize their own brain fat for transfer to\nthe fetus. We hypothesize that the contrasting patterns\nof brain size, growth, composition, and birth weight in\npsychosis and autism are mediated by effects of maternal\nversus paternal genes, with paternal genes driving the\nacquisition of increased brain fatty acids in particular.\nDirectly parallel arguments have been made concerning\nintragenomic conflict over body fat in human babies\n(Haig 1999b): Human neonates exhibit by far the highest\naverage body fat content of any mammal, which may rep-\nresent an adaptation to sequester resources to fuel sus-\ntained brain growth in early childhood (Badcock 2000,\npp. 208\u2013212; Cunnane & Crawford 2003; Kuzawa\n1998). A role for imprinted genes in human fat metabolism\nis suggested by Silver-Russell syndrome, which is caused\nby a bias towards relative maternal gene expression and\ninvolves a striking lack of subcutaneous fat (Monk &\nMoore 2004).\nPatterns and predictions regarding early brain growth in\nautism and schizophrenia are critically important to the\ntheory proposed here, because altered early brain\ngrowth rates are expected to strongly influence patterns\nof brain connectivity and cerebral lateralization, as\ndescribed in detail in the next sections.\n6.1.2. Hippocampus and amygdala size. The hippo-\ncampus is centrally involved in learning and the consolida-\ntion of memory, with the right side more involved in\nspatial cognition, and the left side dedicated more to\naspects of memory (Burgess et al. 2002; Piefke & Fink\n2005). By contrast, the amygdala provides social and\nemotional valence to sensory perceptions, such as the rec-\nognition of fearful stimuli, providing input on emotional\ncontent to brain structures such as the hippocampus and\nneocortex (Adolphs et al. 2002; Sander et al. 2003; Skuse\net al. 2003). Integrated activity of the amygdala, hippo-\ncampus, and social-brain components of the neocortex\nhas been hypothesized as a core aspect of the social\nbrain system, that processes the rapid, complex infor-\nmation flow involved in human interaction, especially\ninteractions involving emotion, language, and facial\nexpression.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 249\nAutism and schizophrenia both involve alterations in\nstructure and function of the interacting amygdala, hippo-\ncampus, and prefrontal cortex (Baron-Cohen et al. 2005;\nBerretta et al. 2001; Burns 2004; 2006a; Gisabella et al.\n2005; J. D. Johnson 2005). The available evidence indi-\ncates that relative to brain size, the hippocampus and\namygdala are larger in autism than in controls (at least\nduring early development) (Schumann et al. 2004; Stan-\nfield et al., in press), and (in most studies, and in adults)\nsmaller in schizophrenia and schizotypy (Aleman &\nKahn 2005; Geuze et al. 2005; Gur et al. 2004; 2007;\nKuroki et al. 2006; Lawrie et al. 2003; Narr et al. 2002;\n2004; Suzuki et al. 2005; Tamminga & Holcomb 2005;\nvan Elst & Trimble 2003). In schizophrenia, smaller size\nand altered shape of the hippocampus may be functionally\nrelated to positive symptoms such as paranoia and delu-\nsions, in that the hippocampus mediates the creation,\nmaintenance, and updating of contextual social and\nspatial \u201cworldviews\u201d and beliefs, via interactions with the\nneocortex and amygdala (e.g., Gray 1998; J. D. Johnson\n2005). In autism, increased hippocampus size may be\nrelated to enhanced visual-spatial, mathematical, and\nmechanistic aspects of cognition (Baron-Cohen et al.\n2001; Minshew et al. 1997), as best seen in Asperger syn-\ndrome mechanistic skills, and the abilities of autistic\nsavants at calculation and memory (Heaton & Wallace\n2004; Pring 2005; see also Young et al. 2004). Individuals\nwith schizophrenia, and schizotypal individuals, exhibit\ncognitive profiles of impaired visual-spatial and arithmetic\nabilities, relative to verbal abilities, as described in more\ndetail in the section on sex difference further on.\n6.1.3. Cerebral lateralization. Schizophrenia involves\nreduced structural and functional brain asymmetry, as\nindicated by an increased incidence of mixed or inconsis-\ntent handedness, imaging studies of neuroanatomy with a\nfocus on language-related regions such as the planum tem-\nporale, asymmetries in neurotransmitter activity, and\nhigher impairments in verbal ability for individuals less\nlateralized for handedness (Chance et al. 2005; Collinson\net al. 2003; Crow 1997; 1998; 2000; Crow et al. 1998;\nDeLisi et al. 2002; Honea et al. 2005; Leask & Crow\n2005; Mitchell & Crow 2005; Schiffman et al. 2005; Shira-\nkawa et al. 2001; Sommer et al. 2001; Weiss et al. 2006).\nThis reduced brain lateralization and lower degree of\ntorque in schizophrenia is apparently associated with\nslower brain development (Crow et al. 1996; 1998; Saugs-\ntad 1998; 1999), relatively increased dysfunction of com-\nponents of the left hemisphere compared to the right\n(e.g., Honea et al. 2005; Kasai et al. 2003a; 2003b; Mucci\net al. 2005) with diminished left-hemisphere specialization\nfor language (Dollfus et al. 2005; Mitchell & Crow 2005),\nand an increase in the extent of positive symptoms such as\ndelusions (Verdoux et al. 2004). Similar patterns have been\ndetected in healthy individuals, in whom the degree of\nschizotypal cognition is positively associated with mixed\nhandedness and other evidence of reduced cerebral later-\nalization (Barnett & Corballis 2002; Jaspers-Fayer &\nPeters 2005; Preti et al. 2007; Shaw et al. 2001).\nImpaired or reduced left-hemisphere language function\nin schizophrenia and schizotypy may result in greater\nreliance on right-hemisphere processing of some com-\nponents of thought and language (Fisher et al. 2004;\nMohr et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2002). A crucial result of\nsuch a shift may be more \u201ccoarse\u201d semantic processing;\ngeneration of \u201cloose,\u201d more-distant associations between\nevents and thoughts (Pizzagalli et al. 2000); overestimation\nof meaningfulness of naturally occurring coincidences;\nincreased paranormal ideation; and at the extreme, delu-\nsion, paranoia, and other positive symptoms of schizo-\nphrenia (Brugger 2001; Brugger & Graves 1997a; 1997b;\nLeonhard & Brugger 1998). This hypothesis is supported\nby a diverse range of additional evidence, from modelling\nof neural networks (Hoffman et al. 2004), to neurocogni-\ntive and psychological analyses of schizotypy (Claridge\n1997), and the use of dopamine agonists to restore left-\nhemisphere language dominance (Mohr et al. 2005). The\nhypothesis also provides a relatively simple neuroanatomi-\ncal and neurophysiological explanation for the links\nbetween creativity and psychosis as a cognitive style that\ninvolves more-distant and more-novel associations between\ncomponents of thought (Barrantes-Vidal 2004; Brugger\n2001; Gianotti et al. 2001). The general links of imagin-\nation and creativity with psychosis (Claridge et al. 1990;\nNettle 2001; Sack et al. 2005) strongly contrast with the\nlower levels of pretend play and symbolic creativity, as\nwell as increased repetitive and compulsive behavior, in\nautism (Atlas & Lapidus 1987; Blanc et al. 2005;\nBoucher 2007; U. Frith 2004; Honey et al. 2006; Turner\n1999).\nWhereas schizophrenia is associated with reduced\nasymmetry, autism tends to involve increased size of\nsome right-hemisphere cortical structures (i.e., reversed\nasymmetry compared to normal), and reversed lateraliza-\ntion of language (Bigler et al. 2007; De Fosse\u00b4 et al. 2004;\nEscalante-Mead et al. 2003; Flagg et al. 2005; Herbert\net al. 2002; 2005; see also Rinehart et al. 2002b; Sutton\net al. 2005). As the right hemisphere develops earlier\nthan the left hemisphere in the fetal and neonatal stages\n(Chiron et al. 1995; see also Rinehart et al. 2002b),\na pattern of rightward asymmetry in autism may be due\nsimply to a faster, earlier pattern of brain development \u2013 a\nheterochronic shift opposite to a slower developmental\nprofile in schizophrenia (Saugstad 1999). Accelerated\nearly brain development in autism, and relatively slow\nbrain development in schizophrenia, may thus both lead\nto anomalous lateralization of cognitive functions.\n6.1.4. Corpus callosum size and brain connectivity. In\nautism, the corpus callosum is relatively small (for brain\nsize) compared to control individuals (Cody et al. 2002;\nEgaas et al. 1995; Nyde\u00b4n et al. 2004; Piven et al. 1997;\nSherr et al. 2005; Stanfield et al., in press; Waiter et al.\n2005). A pattern of reduced interhemispheric brain connec-\ntivity in autistic individuals (Belmonte et al. 2004a; 2004b;\nNyde\u00b4n et al. 2004) fits with one of the central hypotheses\nfor the cognitive architecture of autism: that it involves\nincreased local and decreased global information proces-\nsing, reduced \u201ccentral coherence,\u201d increased \u201cbottom-up\u201d\nrelative to \u201ctop-down\u201d processing, and decreased overall\nbrain connectivity (Baron-Cohen & Belmonte 2005; Bel-\nmonte et al. 2004a; 2004b; Happe\u00b4 & Frith 2006; Just\net al. 2004). Courchesne and Pierce (2005b) have\nreferred to autistic neurocognition as the frontal cortex\nunconsciously \u201ctalking to itself,\u201d concomitant with loss\nof language and other elements of social cognition.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n250 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nFindings regarding corpus callosum size in schizo-\nphrenia are mixed and inconsistent, apparently due to\nmarked variation with age, sex, handedness, and clinical\nprofile (Bachmann et al. 2003; Brambilla et al. 2005;Down-\nhill et al. 2000; Highley et al. 2003; Luders et al. 2003;\nTuncer et al. 2005). The issue of brain connectivity in\nschizophrenia has yet to reach a consensus among research-\ners, as it has for autism, perhaps due to the high clinical\nheterogeneity in schizophrenia. A considerable body of\nevidence suggests that schizophrenia involves altered intra-\nhemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity, but such\nchanges take particular forms, such as altered transfer of\nverbal information between hemispheres (Barnett & Kirk\n2005; Barnett et al. 2005; Endrass et al. 2002), that are dif-\nficult to interpret without a cognitivemodel for their signifi-\ncance. One possibility suggested by neural network\nmodels, and consistent with increased relative corpus cal-\nlosum size, is that schizophrenia involves reduced local\n(relative to global) connections (Siekmeier & Hoffman\n2002), which would provide a contrast with the enhanced\nlocal connectivity and processing found in autism\n(Courchesne & Pierce 2005a; 2005b; Happe\u00b4 & Frith\n2006). This hypothesis is supported by several findings,\nincluding: (1) the results of Whalley et al. (2005), who\nrecorded increased connectivity of left parietal with left\nprefrontal regions in individuals at high risk of schizo-\nphrenia; (2) hyperconnectivity across brain regions for\nsome (though not other) EEG frequencies in schizo-\nphrenia (Sritharan et al. 2005; Strelets et al. 2002; see\nalso McCreery & Claridge 1996); and (3) coactivation of\ninner speech and language regions normally activated in\nsequence (Hubl et al. 2004) and inferred wider-spreading\nactivation of brain regions in schizophrenia (Chance et al.\n2005) and schizotypy (Pizzagalli et al. 2001; see also Nie-\nbauer 2004). Sumich et al. (2005) provide MRI evidence\nthat unreality symptoms and hallucinations in schizo-\nphrenia involve dysfunctions in Heschl\u2019s gyrus that\nimpair bottom-up processing, \u201cgiving greater perceptual\ncontrol to \u2018top-down\u2019 mechanisms\u201d (p. 947); Seal et al.\n(2004) provide evidence for \u201cheightened influence of\ntop-down processing on perception\u201d in auditory hallucina-\ntions of schizophrenics; and Carter et al. (1996), Granholm\net al. (1999), and Bellgrove et al. (2003) have shown that\nschizophrenia involves greater impairments in local as\nopposed to global processing of stimuli, and exaggerated\nglobal-processing advantages for some tasks.\nFinally, the neuroanatomical and cognitive correlates of\ndyslexia are notably similar to those found in schizo-\nphrenia and schizotypy (Bersani et al. 2006; Bradshaw &\nNettleton 1983, pp. 242\u201354; Edgar et al. 2006; Heim\net al. 2004; Richardson 1994), and dyslexia has also been\nlinked with \u201cenhanced ability to process visual-spatial\ninformation globally (holistically) rather than locally\n(part by part)\u201d (von Ka\u00b4rolyi et al. 2003). By contrast, hyper-\nlexia, the spontaneous and highly precocious mastery\nof reading in children (Grigorenko et al. 2003; Silberberg\n& Silberberg 1967; 1971), is found almost exclusively\nin conjunction with autism (Burd & Kerbeshian 1988;\nJust et al. 2004; Turkeltaub et al. 2004). The neural basis\nfor hyperlexia was investigated in a single case study\nusing fMRI: Hyperlexic reading was associated with\nhyperactivation of the left superior temporal cortex, a\nregion that is hypoactivated in dyslexia (Turkeltaub et al.\n2004).\n6.2. Neurodevelopment\nMany of the diverse traits in Table 1 are developmentally\nand functionally related, with a central role for coordi-\nnated allometric development of brain size, relative sizes\nof brain regions, brain grey and white matter composition,\nintra- versus inter-hemispheric connectivity, corpus callo-\nsum size, and cerebral asymmetry (Burns 2006a). Thus,\nautism commonly involves an acceleration of brain devel-\nopment, increased childhood brain size (especially in the\nfrontal lobe), and relatively increased white matter\n(Carper et al. 2002; Courchesne 2004; Courchesne &\nPierce 2005a; 2005b; McCaffery & Deutsch 2005; Schu-\nmann et al. 2004). In humans and other primates,\nincreased overall brain size normally involves an increased\nrelative proportion of white matter (Schoenemann et al.\n2005), relatively increased intra-hemispheric (compared\nto inter-hemispheric) connectivity (see Burns 2006a), and\na corpus callosum small relative to brain size (Rilling &\nInsel 1999; Vidal et al. 2006). Brain-growth acceleration\nin autism may also engender faster growth of the develop-\nmentally leading right-hemisphere prior to age three (see\nChi et al. 1977; Chiron et al. 1995; Pilcher et al. 2001;\nSeldon 2005), resulting in a higher frequency of reversed\n(rightward) asymmetry especially in language areas such\nas the planum temporale, and contributing to the\ngeneral pattern in autism of apparent relative deficits in\nright-hemispheric and relatively global tasks (Gunter\net al. 2002; Previc 2007). By contrast, as described\nearlier, schizophrenia apparently involves slower early\nbrain development, smaller brain size, and relative\nreductions in white matter, which may lead to differen-\ntially impaired development of the slower-developing left\nhemisphere (e.g., Crow 1997; Flor-Henry 1969; Gala-\nburda 1984; Harrison 1999; Hulshoff Pol et al. 2006;\nMohr et al. 2001). This contrast between relative left\nhemisphere dysfunction in schizophrenia (involving rela-\ntive deficits in sequential, serial, and more-local encoding\nand processing tasks) versus relative right-hemisphere\nimpairment in autism (involving relative strengths in\nsome local and linear processing tasks but relative deficits\nin gestalt, more-global, holistic tasks such as social inter-\naction; see Bradshaw & Nettleton 1983, pp. 162\u201372) is a\nconsiderable oversimplication, but it potentially helps to\nlink dysregulated early brain growth rates with important\naspects of lateralized cognition (Han et al. 2002). We\nstress that both autism and schizophrenia involve absolute\ndeficits in functions ascribed to both hemispheres \u2013 for\nexample, schizophrenics show impaired pragmatics of\nlanguage (Langdon et al. 2002) \u2013 and that the \u201cnormal\u201d\nfunctions of the two hemispheres may not always be\nunambiguously attributed to their usual cerebral locations\nin these two conditions.\nThe hypothesis that autism involves general effects of\naccelerated early brain development, and psychosis\ninvolves slower development, is supported by three\nadditional lines of evidence.\nFirst, autism involves overactivation of some growth-\nsignalling pathways and some key brain growth factors\nsuch as BDNF (Carper et al. 2002; Connolly et al. 2006;\nMcCaffery & Deutsch 2005; Miyazaki et al. 2004;\nNelson 2001; Nishimura et al. 2007a; Tsai 2005). In con-\ntrast to autism, schizophrenia involves deficiencies in\ngrowth factors (Gunnell & Holly 2004; Hashimoto et al.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 251\n2005; Klejbor et al. 2006; Moises et al. 2002; Niculescu\n2005; Weickert et al. 2003; 2005), which can in some\ncases be traced directly to the disorder (e.g., Pieper\net al. 2005).\nSecond, undergrowth versus overgrowth effects on\nhuman brain development are strongly mediated by the\nphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway\n(Brunet et al. 2001), which is strikingly downregulated in\nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder via alterations in\ngrowth-enhancing genes (Emamian et al. 2004; Kalkman\n2006; Stopkova et al. 2004) but exhibits hyperactivation\nin some autistic conditions due to reduced expression or\nactivity of genes that negatively regulate PI3K pathway\nactivation, including PTEN, NF1, TSC1, TSC2, and\nPRKCB1 (Belmonte & Bourgeron 2006; Butler et al.\n2005; Crespi, under revision; Kwon et al. 2006; McCall\net al. 2006; Philippi et al. 2005; Serajee et al. 2003). In\nturn, PI3K signalling is mediated in part by the growth-\nregulating imprinted genes GRB10, IGF2, H19, and\nGNAS (Charalambous et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2004;\nDeng et al. 2003; Fults 2005; Hartmann et al. 2005;\nMahmoud & Grover 2006; Riedel 2004; Smith et al.\n2006; Wick et al. 2003).\nThird, brain development may also be strongly affected\nby altered thresholds for apoptosis and synaptic pruning,\nas excessive pruning during adolescence has been\nsuggested as a strong risk factor for schizophrenia (Burns\n2004; de la Fuente-Sandoval et al. 2005; Walker & Bollini\n2002; Woo & Crowell 2005). By contrast, several studies\nsuggest that decreased apoptosis may be related to the\naccelerated early neurodevelopment found in autism\n(Courchesne & Pierce 2005a; Engstrom et al. 2003;\nFatemi & Halt 2001). We suggest that the pathology of\nnegative symptoms of schizophrenia in particular may be\nmediated by excessive loss of synapses and grey matter,\ncaused in part by a bias towards maternally expressed\nimprinted genes, many of which act as tumor suppressors\nthat enhance apoptosis, whereas paternally expressed\ngenes enhance cell survival and growth (e.g., Kurita\net al. 2006; Margetts et al. 2005).\nThe hypothesis that neurodevelopment is accelerated in\nautism but slowed in schizophrenia is congruent with\nneurodevelopmental models of these conditions (Courch-\nesne & Pierce 2005a; 2005b; Kalkman 2006; Rapoport\net al. 2005; Redcay & Courchesne 2005). The hypothesis\nalso fits with expectations from the conflict theory of\nimprinting: That autism, driven by imbalance towards\nincreased effects of paternal gene expression, involves\nfaster growth and increased demands on the mother,\nwhereas psychosis engenders the reverse. We have illus-\ntrated this hypothesis in Figure 3, which depicts its conti-\nnuity with classic neurodevelopmental models. Further\nanalyses of this neurodevelopmental hypothesis require\ndemonstrating effects of imprinted genes on early brain\ngrowth, altered lateralization (e.g., Francks et al. 2007;\nSun et al. 2005), and position along a cognitive spectrum\nfrom autism to psychosis.\n6.3. Cognition\nDiverse hypotheses have been proposed to explain how\nneurological functions are altered in psychotic and\nautistic-spectrum conditions (e.g., Baron-Cohen et al.\n2005; Bru\u00a8ne 2004; Burns 2004; Gray 1998; Happe\u00b4 &\nFrith 2006; J. D. Johnson 2005). A point of near-consensus\nin these ideas is that cognitive dysfunctions are driven by\naltered interactions between and within components of\nthe human social brain, which comprises the amygdala,\nsuperior temporal sulcus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior\ncongulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, temporal\npoles, medial prefrontal cortex, and the mirror-neuron\nsystems (Bru\u00a8ne 2004; Burns 2004, 2006a; Happe\u00b4 & Frith\n2006). Our hypothesis predicts that integrated social\nbrain systems are disrupted in diametrically opposite\nways in autistic- and psychotic-spectrum conditions. This\nhypothesis can be evaluated via analysis of how aspects\nof gaze, intentionality, agency, theory of mind, and the\nmirror-neuron systems are underdeveloped or dysregu-\nlated in autism and in schizophrenia, the condition with\nthe most information available.\n6.3.1. Gaze and intention.Humans are unique among pri-\nmates in exhibiting a white sclera (the \u201cwhites of the eyes\u201d)\n(Emery 2000), which allows direct observation of the form\nand directionality of gaze (e.g., Whalen et al. 2004). Gaze\nis a fundamental component of social interactions, with\nmost humans exquisitely cognizant of the gaze of others\nand perceptive of direction and form of gaze, and\nexpressions around the eyes, as conveying a considerable\namount of social information concerning mental state\nand intention (Emery 2000). Specific neural regions, in\nthe neocortex and amygdala, are dedicated to perception\nand interpretation of gaze and facial expression in\nhumans and other primates (Emery 2000; M. H.\nJohnson 2005). The amygdala in particular is highly acti-\nvated when humans gaze upon one another, as emotional\nvalence of the interaction is inferred from features of the\neyes and surrounding face, with especially notable sensi-\ntivity to fear (Adolphs et al. 2005; Castelli 2005; Schwartz\net al. 2003a; 2003b; Whalen et al. 2004).\nAutistic individuals exhibit notable avoidance of gaze,\nand reduced or absent following of gaze (Asperger 1991;\nEmery 2000; Frith 2003, p. 105; Ristic et al. 2005). Such\nbehavior has motivated the development of theories for\nautism based on impairment of the amygdala (as in cases\nof amygdala damage), with consequent reduction in\nability to detect and assimilate social and emotional infor-\nmation from the eyes and faces of other humans (Adolphs\net al. 2002; Baron-Cohen et al. 2000; Brambilla et al. 2004;\nShaw et al. 2004). First-person accounts by autistic indi-\nviduals (Lawson 1998, pp. 11\u201312; O\u2019Neill 1999, p. 26)\nsuggest that amygdala \u201cimpairment\u201d may involve hyper-\nactivation, such that direct gaze is sufficiently uncomfor-\ntable, overwhelming, and fear-inspiring to warrant\navoidance. This inference is also supported by the larger\nsize of the amygdala in autism (at least during early child-\nhood) (Schumann et al. 2004), lower levels of the fear-\nreducing neuropeptide oxytocin in autism (Green et al.\n2001; Kirsch et al. 2005), the ability of autistic children\nto recognize basic emotions (though not social, self-con-\nscious emotions) from eyes and facial features (Castelli\n2005; see also Adolphs et al. 2005), reduced inhibition of\nthe amygdala in autism (Rubenstein & Merzenich 2003),\na functional-imaging study that shows heightened amyg-\ndala activation in response to gaze fixation in autism\n(Dalton et al. 2005a), and relatively strong neurological\nlinks between the amygdala and the right hemisphere in\nnormal subjects compared to autistics (Noesselt et al.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n252 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\n2005). Long-term avoidance of gaze and faces presumably\nreduces opportunities for autistic children to develop skills\nrelated to this core component of social behavior, via cog-\nnitive appraisal of eye and facial features during inter-\nactions (Gla\u00a8scher & Adolphs 2003; M. H. Johnson 2005;\nSkuse et al. 2005; see also Adolphs et al. 2005). Such defi-\ncits, as well as other components of the social brain, may\nbe involved in the underdeveloped theory of mind found\nin Kanner autism and to a lesser extent in Asperger syn-\ndrome (Baron-Cohen 2002; 2003; Bowler 1992; Downs &\nSmith 2004).\nLangdon et al. (2006b) demonstrated that schizophrenia\ninvolves abnormal over-responsiveness in attentional orient-\ning to gaze (see also Emery 2000; Franck et al. 1998),\nwhich is the opposite pattern to that observed in autism.\nAlthough impairments in tests of recognizing expression\nfrom eyes and faces have been described in schizophrenia\n(e.g., Kington et al. 2000) as for autism, such deficits\nappear to be a function of inaccurate inferences concern-\ning gaze of others as directed towards them (Hooker &\nPark 2005), and mistaken inference of mental states\nfrom gaze (Langdon et al. 2006a; 2006b), rather than the\nunderdevelopment or absence of mental-state attribution\nascribed to autistic cognition (Baron-Cohen 2002; Craig\net al. 2004; Frith 2003). Paranoia, a prominent feature in\nthe positive symptoms of psychosis, also commonly\ninvolves obsession with the gaze of others as directed\ntowards one\u2019s self, often concomitant to delusions of per-\nsecution and conspiracy (e.g., Badcock 2004; Franck\net al. 1998; Green & Phillips 2004; LaRusso 1978;\nMcKay et al. 2005).\nWe interpret these features of psychosis as forms of\nhyper-mentalizing, such that theory of mind is dysregu-\nlated via impaired, inflexible, or extreme inferences\nregarding social cues and over-attribution of mental\nstates and intentions (Abu-Akel 1999; Abu-Akel &\nBailey 2000; Badcock 2004; Blackwood et al. 2001;\nC. D. Frith 2004; Harrington et al. 2005a; 2005b;\nLangdon & Coltheart 1999; Langdon et al. 2006a; Phil-\nlips et al. 2000; Steiner 2004). Indeed, the evolutionary\npsychiatrist Randolph Nesse noted that \u201cthose who\nhave worked with schizophrenics know the eerie\nfeeling of being with someone whose intuitions are\nacutely tuned to the subtlest unintentional cues, even\nwhile the person is incapable of accurate empathic\nunderstanding\u201d (Nesse 2004, p. 62), and Claridge et al.\n(1990, p. 221) noted that \u201canyone who has interacted\nwith psychotics will know of their uncanny capacity to\nrespond to subtle social cues, believed to have been con-\ncealed from them.\u201d These patterns contrast with the\nextreme literal-mindedness found in autistic individuals,\nin comparison to the common overinterpretation of\nlinguistic and visual input in schizophrenia and to some\ndegree in schizotypy (Langdon & Coltheart 2004;\nLangdon et al. 2002; Russell et al. 2006), although\nschizophrenia can also involve deficits that engender\nimpaired processing of figurative language (Thoma &\nDaum 2006). Both autistic literal-mindedness and\nmechanistic cognition, and psychotic-spectrum overin-\nterpretation can lead, though by different mechanisms,\nto deficits in theory of mind tasks and understanding\nof pragmatic language such as metaphor and humor\n(C. D. Frith 2004; Frith & Allen 1988; Mitchell &\nCrow 2005). Taken together, this evidence suggests\nthat reaction to gaze, as well as tendency to attribute\nmental states and intentions to others, exhibit contrasting\npatterns of hyperdevelopment and underdevelopment in\npsychosis and autism (Table 1).\nFigure 3. Our neurodevelopmental model of autism and psychosis is compatible with previous theory and data on dysregulated\nneurodevelopment in these two sets of conditions, which posits diverse effects from many genes as well as environmental effects\n(e.g., valproic acid; see Rinaldi et al. 2008), but it contrasts these conditions as diametric opposites modulated by differential brain\ngrowth and development, with notable effects from genetic and epigenetic alterations of imprinted genes. The degree to which\nimprinted and non-imprinted genes contribute to effects on brain growth and development remains unclear, but only imprinted\ngenes are expected to exert effects on cognitive architecture that reflect dysregulated adaptations related to the conflict hypothesis\nof imprinting.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 253\nThe neurophysiological and psychological mechanisms\nunderlying hyperdevelopment of gaze, inference of inten-\ntion, and theory of mind in schizophrenia require further\nstudy. As in autism, the amygdala plays an important role\nin the interactions that mediate theory of mind skills in\nschizophrenia (Benes & Berretta 2001; Bru\u00a8ne 2004;\nBru\u00a8ne & Bru\u00a8ne-Cohrs 2006). Many (though by no means\nall) functional-imaging studies demonstrate that schizo-\nphrenia engenders underactivation of the amygdala com-\npared to controls in tests of recognizing facial expression\nand emotional valence (Brunet-Gouet & Decety 2006;\nDas et al. 2007; Gur et al. 2002; Holt et al. 2006;\nKucharska-Pietura et al. 2003; Paradiso et al. 2003; Phillips\net al. 1999; Schneider et al. 1998). These findings are con-\nsistent with the emotional dysregulation commonly found\nin schizophrenia (Aleman & Kahn 2005), although the\nconnections between emotion and cognition in this and\nother psychotic-spectrum conditions remain unclear.\nUnderactivation of the amygdala may also be a manifes-\ntation of reduced cognitive effects from the paternal\nbrain (Keverne 2001a; 2001b) in negative-symptom\nschizophrenia.\nFinally, gaze and intentionality are intimately associated\nwith the expression of emotion, which is generally recog-\nnized as reduced in schizophrenia and major depression\n(e.g., Gaebel & Wo\u00a8lwer 2004; Troisi et al. 2007), although\nlack of facial expression need not indicate a lack of\nemotional experience (Tre\u00b4meau et al. 2005); indeed,\na relatively high level of positive schizotypy appears to\nbe associated with more intense emotionality (Kerns\n2005). Parental reports provide evidence that autistic chil-\ndren are highly expressive, especially for negative emotion,\nalthough they \u201ccommunicated feeling states idiosyncrati-\ncally, in a manner only their mother understood\u201d (Capps\net al. 1993) (p. 475). Losh and Capps (2006) also report\nthat autistic children are no less emotionally expressive\nthan controls for basic emotions, though not self-conscious\nones. In autism, levels of basic emotionality may thus be as\nhigh or higher than normal (in keeping with relatively\nenhanced paternal-brain functions), but emotional reac-\ntions lack social context and sensitivity due to reductions\nin the ability of the neocortical, maternal brain to integrate\nsocial-cognitive understanding and control with emotion\nand behavior.\n6.3.2. Agency and self. Monitoring of gaze and inference\nof intention involve application of theory of mind skills to\nother individuals (Emery 2000; Tomasello et al. 2005). The\nother domain for theory of mind is reflexive \u2013 that is, self-\nconsciousness, mentalized awareness of one\u2019s self as an\nagent acting upon the external world, and exhibiting spon-\ntaneous self-directed thought. Several lines of evidence\nsuggest that autism involves a diminished or altered\nsense of self: (1) selective impairments of episodic and\nautobiographical memory \u2013 the mental constructs that\ngenerate and maintain a sense of self (Gardiner 2002; Gar-\ndiner et al. 2003) \u2013 while rote, factual memory is spared or\nenhanced (O\u2019Shea et al. 2005; Toichi & Kamio 2002; Wil-\nliams et al. 2006b); (2) a tendency to think in visual pic-\ntures (Grandin 1995; Hurlburt et al. 1994; Kana et al.\n2006), suggesting a shift to the right hemisphere for\nbrain regions generating spontaneous thought (Christoff\net al. 2004); (3) a reduced sense of self-consciousness\nand personal agency, perhaps due to reduced central\ncoherence at this level (Ben Shalom 2000; Fitzgerald\n2005, p. 78; Frith & Happe\u00b4 2005; Grandin 1995; 2004;\nJohnson 2003; Lawson 1998, p. i; Lombardo et al. 2007;\nToichi et al. 2002); (4) a less developed imagination, as\nnoted earlier (Craig & Baron-Cohen 1999; Happe\u00b4 1994,\np. 37; Losh & Capps 2003); and (5) less developed experi-\nence of social and self-conscious emotion (Heerey et al.\n2003; Losh & Capps 2006). Autism also involves cognition\nhighly focused on few particular non-social aspects of the\nenvironment, which is expressed in repetitive behavior,\nintense preoccupations about specific and narrow topics,\nand difficulties in shifting attention (Courchesne et al.\n1994; Goldstein et al. 2001a; Happe\u00b4 1994; Landry &\nBryson 2004; Murray et al. 2005). These features may\ninteract via positive feedback to reduce the degree to\nwhich these individuals become socially enculturated\n(Murray et al. 2005), a central process in human\ndevelopment.\nIn contrast to autism, schizotypy and schizophrenia\nare characterized by high levels of distractability,\nreduced filtering of sensory input, and \u201cloose\u201d associations\nbetween external stimuli and between components of\nthought (e.g., Bellgrove et al. 2003; Brugger & Graves\n1997a; 1997b; Claridge & Beech 1995; Grossberg 2000b;\nMathes et al. 2005; Nakamura et al. 2003; Pizzagalli\net al. 2000). The positive symptoms of schizophrenia\noften involve delusions, such as persecution and grandios-\nity, that \u201creflect individuals\u2019 preoccupations about their\nposition in the social universe\u201d (Bentall 2003b, p. 293) in\ncreating complex and fanciful mental autobiographies\n(Salazar-Fraile et al. 2004), and an increased awareness\nof self and intentionality is found in schizophrenic delu-\nsions of control (Frith 2005b). Social and reflexive preoc-\ncupations can be described in terms of exaggerated self-\nconsciousness (Sass & Parnas 2003), and indeed, auditory\nhallucination, thought insertion, and passivity phenomena\n(e.g., Behrendt 2004; Crow 2004a; 2004b) can be inter-\npreted as functions of a breakdown in cognitive distinction\nbetween self and other, as in some spiritual experiences of\nschizotypal individuals (Brugger 2001). Breakdowns in\nself-monitoring, such as interpreting inner speech as exter-\nnal, or delusions of control of hand movements, have an\napparent neurological basis in impaired ability to self-\nmonitor the coordination of intended (premotor) actions\n(mainly speech and gesture) with one\u2019s current and pre-\ndicted state (Frith et al. 2000; Jones & Fernyhough\n2007). By contrast, autism appears to involve absent or\nreduced use of inner speech (Whitehouse et al. 2006).\nFinally, auditory hallucinations commonly involve social\ndialogue, commentary, and commands, with a focus on\ncomplex, self-conscious emotions such as shame, con-\ntempt, derogation, and embarrassment (e.g., Legg &\nGilbert 2006); Bentall (2003a, p. 354) notes how such hal-\nlucinations often involve the voices of \u201csignificant family\nmembers,\u201d and Birchwood et al. (2004) describes them\nas operating \u201clike external social relationships.\u201d These pat-\nterns, and the common feelings of guilt, deserved punish-\nment, and worthlessness in major depression (Keller et al.\n2007), suggest that social emotions and interactions are\noften overdeveloped in psychotic-spectrum disorders, in\ncontrast to their reduction in autism, as described earlier.\n6.3.3. Functional imaging of the social brain. The neuro-\nlogical basis for dysregulation of gaze, intention, agency,\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n254 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nand theory of mind in autism and psychosis provides a\nmechanistic level of analysis that should dovetail with\npsychological descriptions of these processes. Thus, autis-\ntic- and psychotic-spectrum disorders may be expected\nto exhibit contrasting patterns of brain activation in\nfunctional-imaging studies that involve analyzing specific\ncomponents of the social brain, as described earlier for\nthe amygdala. We have found evidence for specific con-\ntrasts involving four brain regions or networks, although\ndifferences in the tasks utilized limit the strength of infer-\nences in some cases.\nFirst, Greicius et al. (2003) have described the brain\u2019s\n\u201cdefault mode\u201d or \u201cresting state\u201d network, which includes\nthe medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex,\nventral anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. This\nmidline-structure network exhibits high metabolic rate at\nrest, with functions related to self-referential processing,\nprocessing of information related to theory of mind, inner\nspeech, retrieving and manipulating memories, and deve-\nloping future plans (Garrity et al. 2007; Greicius et al.\n2003; Kennedy et al. 2006). This network is then \u201cdeacti-\nvated\u201d when attention is redirected to a specific cognitive\ntask. Kennedy et al. (2006) have described a \u201cfailure to\ndeactivate\u201d in autistics, which they attribute to a lower\nlevel of baseline resting-state activity, and default-mode\ncognition directed more towards obsessive interests and\nsensory-environment processing than towards self-reflective,\ntheory-of-mind, and memory-retrieval activities. Moreover,\na higher level of social impairment was associated with a\nlower degree of deactivation among subjects, which\nsuggests a direct link between social cognition and acti-\nvation of the resting network. Ohnishi et al. (2000) and Cas-\ntelli et al. (2002) also found reduced activation in autism for\nregions involved in theory of mind, notably the medial pre-\nfrontal cortex.\nIn contrast to these results for autism, Garrity et al.\n(2007) and Harrison et al. (2007) have described greater\ntask-induced deactivation in schizophrenics than in con-\ntrols, for some regions. Garrity et al. (2007) have also\nreported that stronger positive symptoms are associated\nwith greater deactivation (due to increased activity at\nrest), and that schizophrenics included a larger area of\nthe parahippocampal gyrus in the default mode than did\ncontrols. Higher deactivation has also been reported in\nanxiety disorder than in controls (Zhao et al. 2007); and\nin major depression, a specific, affect-processing region\nof the default network, the subgenual cingulate, exhibits\nincreased metabolic rate and higher functional connecti-\nvity with the medial prefrontal cortex than in controls\n(Greicius et al. 2007), which the authors ascribe to\nincreased self-referential and emotional processing in\nthis condition. This set of studies suggests that psychotic-\nspectrum conditions may involve alterations in resting-\nstate network activation specific to increased mentalistic\nfunctions, and that they also show a pattern of greater\ndeactivation of the default network than in controls or in\nautism.\nSecond, one of the primary areas involved in mental\nattribution and processing of agency is Brodmann\u2019s area\n(BA) 8 in the dorsomedial frontal cortex (Finger et al.\n2006; Fletcher et al. 1995; Goel et al. 1995; Marjoram\net al. 2006). Increased activity in this region has been\nassociated with increased genetic risk of schizophrenia\nby Whalley et al. (2004), and Frith (1996) describes\nevidence that this region is involved in auditory hallucina-\ntions in schizophrenia. By contrast, Happe\u00b4 et al. (1996)\nfound normal activity in this area among controls in a\ntheory-of-mind task, but a complete lack of activation in\nan Asperger syndrome group.\nThird, Luna et al. (2002) and Silk et al. (2006) described\nreduced activation in autism for BA 46 in the dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex in a spatial working memory task, which\nthe former authors interpreted in terms of reduced \u201ctop-\ndown\u201d executive function. By contrast, significantly increa-\nsed activation of right-hemisphere BA 46 was found by\nSeidman et al. (2006) in adolescents at high risk for schizo-\nphrenia, and these authors describe parallel findings of\nexaggerated activity in this region from three previous\nstudies. A role for this region in social cognition is indi-\ncated by Knoch et al. (2006), who found activation in\nthis area during implementation of fairness-related beha-\nviors in social-reciprocity tasks.\nA final set of core regions of the social brain is the mirror\nneuron systems. These systems, comprising regions of the\nsuperior temporal sulcus, inferior prefrontal cortex,\ninferior parietal cortex, and other regions, provide neural\nsubstrates for inference of intention, theory of mind and\nempathy, via activation of the same premotor circuitry\nduring observation and execution of specific facial,\nmanual, or other movements (Iacoboni & Dapretto\n2006). Such matching of premotor to observed motor\nactivations allows for automatic inferences regarding the\nintention, disposition, and emotional state of another\nindividual, which can generate cognitive and emotional\nresonance during social interactions. In autism, a key com-\nponent of this system, BA 44 (the pars opercularis), was\nhypoactivated in tasks involving imitation or viewing\nemotional expressions (Dapretto et al. 2006); by contrast,\nQuintana et al. (2001) found overactivation of BA 44 in\nschizophrenia compared to controls for tasks involving\naffective facial expression, which they described in terms\nof \u201cincreased mirror-like representational mechanisms . . .\nwith cues of obvious social value\u201d (p. 923).\nHadjikhani et al. (2007) and Dapretto et al. (2006)\ndescribe evidence that face- and gaze-processing deficits\nin autism are due to impairments in the integrated activity\nof the mirror-neuron system use in facial processing. Pat-\nterns of hypoactivation in mirror-system regions in autism\nare paralleled by evidence for cortical thinning of these\nareas in autism, which is directly related to the severity\nof autistic symptoms (Hadjikhani et al. 2006; Zilbovicius\net al. 2006). Reduced activation of mirror neuron\nsystems in autistics appears specific to tasks dependent\nupon mentalistic cognition, rather than representing a\nmore general impairment that also includes conscious,\ndeliberate imitation or inference of intention from func-\ntional gestures (Hamilton et al. 2007).\nTaken together, these findings indicate that underdeve-\nlopment of the integrated social brain in general, and\nsocial aspects of the mirror neuron system in particular,\nare associated with some of the social-behavioral deficits\nfound in autism (Williams et al. 2001; cf. Dapretto et al.\n2006; Hadjikhani et al. 2006; 2007). Schizophrenia also\nclearly engenders impairments in theory-of-mind skills\nand mentalizing (Brunet-Gouet & Decety 2006; Harring-\nton et al. 2005a; 2005b; Pinkham et al. 2003), which com-\nmonly involve \u201cover-mentalizing,\u201d such as delusional\nideation, inferring false intentions, and a general pattern\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 255\nof confabulation of subjective experience in the face of mis-\ninterpreted objective reality (C. D. Frith 1992; 2004; Frith\n& Frith 1999). Arbib and Mundhenk (2005) link such\nimpairments to the mirror neuron system, in suggesting\nthat functional dissociations between action or speech\nimagination, and enactment of movement or speech, lead\nto misattribution of agency and consequent confabulation\nand rationalizing,whichmanifests as auditoryhallucination,\ndelusions, and paranoia. Similar considerations may apply\nto the mirror-neuron system underlying face perception\nand emotional resonance, which is also dysregulated in\nschizophrenia in the context of emotion inappropriate to\nsocial context and flat affect (e.g., Aleman & Kahn 2005;\nvan Rijn et al. 2005). A recent review of functional-\nimaging studies of social brain dysfunction in schizophrenia\nalso suggests that two mirror-neuron regions \u2013 the inferior\nfrontal cortex and the inferior parietal lobe (see Arbib &\nMundhenk 2005) \u2013 are selectively responsible for some\ncore cognitive manifestations of this disorder, as well as\nstrongly implicating the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior\ncingulate cortex, and amygdala (Brunet-Gouet & Decety\n2006).\nThese findings indicate that in contrast to autism, where\nthe mirror-neuron system does not develop to full, inte-\ngrated functional maturity, in schizophrenia this system\ndevelops but is subject to diverse forms of selective mal-\nfunction. Thus, aspects of theory of mind, and mirror-\nneuron system skills, are selectively impaired in both\nautism and schizophrenia (Bru\u00a8ne & Bru\u00a8ne-Cohrs 2006;\nC. D. Frith 1992; 2004; Lee et al. 2004; Mazza et al.\n2001; Pickup & Frith 2001; Russell et al. 2006; Shamay-\nTsoory et al. 2007; see also McCabe et al. 2004), but, we\nbelieve, for different reasons.\n6.4. Behavior and adaptive significance\nConflicts involving imprinted genes, and mother\u2013off-\nspring conflict more generally, are most obvious during\nprenatal and early childhood development where fitness-\nlimiting resources from placenta and breast can be quan-\ntified. But how does one address and quantify costs\nimposed via cognition and behavior, after early infancy?\nOne prediction of the imprinted brain hypothesis for\nautism and psychosis is that an increased tendency\ntowards autistic traits entails higher costs imposed on\nmothers, and that healthy schizotypal behavior in offspring\nmight benefit the mother and other salient maternal rela-\ntives, presuming that pathological effects of altered devel-\nopment are not too extreme.\nThe autistic spectrum, which literally refers to \u201cself-\nishness\u201d in cognition, involves a large suite of traits that\ncan be interpreted as imposing additional costs on\nmothers (Badcock & Crespi 2006). Indeed, each of the\nthree main classes of behavior that define autism, (1)\nimpaired social interaction, (2) impaired language devel-\nopment, and (3) repetitive behavior and insistence on\nsameness, are likely to engender increased demands.\nSome prevalent traits, such as tantrums, attempts to\ncontrol others, lack of cooperative behavior, and the\nnotable lack of empathy that characterizes Asperger syn-\ndrome (Arbelle et al. 1994; Asperger 1991; Baron-Cohen\n2002; Lawson et al. 2004; Soderstrom et al. 2002),\nappear especially demanding of maternal time and other\nresources. Similar considerations are expected to apply\nto non-clinical individuals on the autistic spectrum,\nshowing to some degree any of the traits in Figure 1.\nThe development of autistic behavior in early childhood\nmeans that increased parental costs extend over many\nyears. Psychoses normally develop in late adolescence or\nearly adulthood, but schizotypal individuals, and juveniles\nwho later develop schizophrenia, exhibit distinctive cogni-\ntive profiles, and some features of these profiles can be\ninterpreted to involve reduced demands on parents. We\nnote first that research on the so-called premorbid person-\nality of schizophrenics has focused almost exclusively on\nidentifying cognitive deficits as predictors of later disease\ndevelopment (e.g., Ellison et al. 1998; Sorensen et al.\n2006). Moreover, schizophrenia itself, like Kanner autism,\ninvolves a considerable degree of pathology, and as such\nit offers much less-direct insight into the dysregulated\nadaptive mechanisms that underlie psychosis than does\nhealthy schizotypy (or the equivalents for bipolar disorder\nand major depression), which exhibits genetic and pheno-\ntypic continuity with disorder at one extreme and norma-\nlity at the other.\nGiven that psychosis and autism can be characterized as\ncognitive spectra grading into normality, and that non-clini-\ncal (\u201chealthy\u201d) individuals with autistic traits and relatively\nunimpaired individuals on the autistic spectrum exhibit\nclear patterns of relative cognitive strengths in some\naspects of mechanistic and sensory cognition (e.g., Gernsba-\ncher et al. 2006; Mottron et al. 2006; Wheelwright & Baron-\nCohen 2001), does \u201chealthy schizotypy\u201d also involve specific\ncognitive strengths (Claridge 1997)? We suggest, based on\nthe overdeveloped mentalistic cognition commonly found\nin schizophrenia, that healthy schizotypy may often\ninvolve enhanced mentalistic abilities and empathy relative\nto normal individuals (Fig. 4). Enhanced theory of mind in\nschizotypy is generally consistent with four lines of evi-\ndence: (1) associations between positive schizotypy scores\nand measures of empathy (Dinn et al. 2002; Rim 1994;\nsee also Sullivan & Allen 1999); (2) better performance by\nschizophrenic children compared to controls in a task invol-\nving deception of others (Pilowsky et al. 2000); (3) more\naccurate recognition of genuine emotions in paranoid\nschizophrenia than in normal controls (LaRusso 1978), or\nin depressed patients (Davis & Gibson 2000); and (4)\nenhanced social-emotional creativity and imagination in\nindividuals with increased levels of schizotypal traits\n(reviewed in Claridge et al. 1990; Nettle 2001). In its\nusual young-adult study subjects, \u201chealthy\u201d positive schizo-\ntypy can also involve higher verbal fluency, \u201copenness\u201d to\nthe environment, and more-developed empathy and altruis-\ntic feelings and behavior in the context of spirituality (Fisher\net al. 2004; Jackson 1997; Tsakanikos & Claridge 2005). By\ncontrast, a number of studies have reported reduced or\nsimilar levels of empathic perspective-taking, or other\ntheory-of-mind tasks, in schizotypy, schizophrenia, or\nfirst-order relatives of schizophrenics (Jahshan & Sergi\n2007; Janssen et al. 2003; Kelemen et al. 2004; Langdon\net al. 2006a; Montag et al. 2007; Pickup 2006). Such diver-\nsity of results may be related to variation in the tasks, popu-\nlations, schizotypy criteria utilized, and the positions of\nsubjects on the mentalistic continuum (Fig. 4). An import-\nant question for future empirical work is determining the\nneurological, psychological, and behavioral correlates of\ntheory of mind and empathy enhanced over \u201cnormal\u201d\nlevels in non-clinical populations.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n256 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nPositive associations of empathy, theory-of-mind skills,\nand other traits such as mirror-neuron system function\nwith scores on scales of positive schizotypy in non-clinical\npopulations represent a useful prediction of the hypothesis\nthat the autistic and psychotic spectra represent broadly\ndiametric sets of conditions, with the caveat that existing\nscales of schizotypy may be geared more towards charac-\nterizing impairments than analyzing cognitive-affective\narchitecture.\nWe thus expect that especially in non-clinical popu-\nlations of children, mildly above-average levels of positive\nschizotypy may be associated with easier enculturation\n(see Brown 2001) and fewer behavioral demands on the\nmother \u2013 traits that should reduce the costs of child\nrearing. This prediction fits with a central role for the\nKevernian maternal brain in the evolution of human cog-\nnition and enculturation of offspring (Badcock 2000), and\na generally heightened receptivity to the environment in\nschizotypy and schizophrenia (Claridge 1997; Dykes &\nMcGhie 1976; Park et al. 1996) compared to avoidance\nof novel stimuli in autism (Gomot et al. 2006).\nAn alternative to this \u201chealthy positive schizotypy\u201d\nhypothesis, which is not mutually exclusive, is that the rela-\ntively low birth weight and slow development typical of\npsychotic-spectrum children are beneficial to mothers\n(and maternal genes), but the later consequences of such\nrelative energetic benefits in gestation and early childhood\nmay impose costs on both mother and offspring (Fig. 5).\nBy this hypothesis, deleterious behavioral aspects of psy-\nchotic-spectrum conditions represent, in part, maladaptive\nby-products of the tug-of-war between maternal and\npaternal imprinted-gene effects being disrupted towards\na maternal-gene bias. Converse considerations apply to\nautistic conditions. Disorders of pregnancy provide clear\nand direct parallels here, in that gestational diabetes and\npre-eclampsia, both of which are mediated by maternal\u2013\nfetal conflict, can involve benefits to the offspring (such\nas higher birth weight) in mild cases, but severe costs\nto both mother and child when the dysregulated\ndevelopmental tug-of-war is more severe (e.g., Catalano &\nKirwan 2001; Haig 1993; Oudejans et al. 2004)\nThere is currently little directly useful data on the\nnature of mother\u2013offspring interactions, and the presum-\nably reduced behavioral and energetic costs involved in\nchild rearing, for individuals exhibiting healthy schizotypy.\nOne line of evidence is increased fertility of individuals in\none or more category of non-affected first-degree relatives\nof schizophrenics, which has been reported in multiple\nstudies (Avila et al. 2001; Bassett et al. 1996; Fan\u02dcana\u00b4s &\nBertranpetit 1995; Haukka et al. 2003; McGlashen et al.\n2006; Srinivasan & Padmavati 1997; Waddington &\nYoussef 1996), although other studies report a lack of\nsuch differences (Buck et al. 1975; Rimmer & Jacobsen\n1976). Thus, Fan\u02dcana\u00b4s and Bertranpetit (1995) reported\nthat the mothers (but not fathers) of schizophrenics had\nsignificantly more siblings than did controls; Bassett\net al. (1996) found no significant difference in number of\nchildren between siblings of schizophrenics and controls,\nexcept for female siblings exhibiting schizotypal traits,\nwho had significantly more offspring; and Waddington\nand Youssef (1996) reported more siblings for male schizo-\nphrenics with a family history of the disorder, compared\nto those without a family history, and a higher risk of\nFigure 4. Autistic and psychotic spectrum conditions can be\nconceptualized as extremes on a continuum of cognitive\narchitecture from mechanistic to mentalistic cognition. The\nheights of the curves represent relative performance within and\nbetween the two cognitive domains, for individuals at any point\nalong the continuum. Autistic-spectrum cognition thus involves\nenhanced mechanistic cognition but reduced mentalistic skills,\nwhile psychotic-spectrum cognition engenders the converse.\nSchizophrenia is hypothesized to involve notably hyper-\ndeveloped mentalistic cognition, which is associated with a\nsuite of impairments, and autism can be characterized in\nterms of maladaptively hyper-mechanistic and hypo-mentalistic\ncognition. The actual shapes of the curves are unknown, but\ntheir relative orientation should be roughly as shown. Figure 5. Alternative models for the costs and benefits to\nmothers and offspring of psychotic-spectrum and autistic-\nspectrum phenotypes can help to explain a range of possible\nrelationships between imprinted gene expression, fetal and\nchild development, and behavior. The psychotic-spectrum case\napplies most closely to schizotypy and schizophrenia. Here,\nmothers may benefit from reduced early parental investment,\nbut in later development they may either garnish fitness\nbenefits or suffer costs, depending upon the nature and\nstrength of the effects on offspring cognition and behavior,\nsuch as more-pronounced impairments in negative schizotypy.\nThe autistic-spectrum case involves increased costs imposed\non mothers in early offspring development; and in later\ndevelopment offspring may either benefit from more-egoistical\ncognition and behavior, or suffer relative costs, depending on\nthe form and magnitude of the developmental disruptions. All\nof these costs and benefits should be considered in the context\nof fitness-mediating interactions between kin.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 257\nschizophrenia in brothers of probands with more than\nseven siblings compared to fewer than seven. Srinivasan\nand Padmavati (1997) reported higher numbers of off-\nspring in parents of schizophrenics compared to the\ngeneral population, and a \u201cnon-significant trend\u201d for higher\nnumbers of offspring produced by siblings of schizophre-\nnics, Avila et al. (2001) found a significantly higher\nnumber of siblings in schizophrenics, compared to a com-\nmunity sample, and Haukka et al. (2003) reported that\nsisters of schizophrenics produced significantly more off-\nspring than controls, while brothers produced significantly\nfewer. Finally, McGlashan et al. (2006) showed with large\nsamples that fertility in parents of individuals with schizo-\nphrenia (and with bipolar disorder) was \u201csubstantially and\nsignificantly\u201d increased. These findings also suggest that\neffects of increased fertility in relatives of schizophrenics\nare relatively strong for female, compared to male, rela-\ntives (but see also Lane et al. 1995), which fits with schizo-\ntypy being more compatible with female than male\ndevelopment and cognition, as described further on.\nSchizophrenia itself engenders reduced fertility compared\nto healthy controls, especially for males (Fan\u02dcana\u00b4s & Ber-\ntranpetit 1995; Haukka et al. 2003; McGrath et al. 1999),\nalthough the presence and strength of this effect varies\nculturally (Hutchinson et al. 1999).\nSome of the epidemiological patterns described above\nmay represent not increased fitness in first-order relatives\nof schizophrenics, but effects of family size on schizo-\nphrenia risk instead. Thus, Wahlbeck et al. (2001b)\nreported that increased schizophrenia risk involves\nhigher numbers of siblings (controlling for maternal\nage), and low body mass index at age seven, and Wester-\ngaard et al. (1999; 2001) found a similar pattern of schizo-\nphrenia being more common in larger sibships, with an\nadditional effect from short intervals between siblings.\nThese findings suggest that in some populations, larger\nfamilies and shorter interbirth intervals engender physio-\nlogical and metabolic stresses on mothers and offspring\nthat increase schizophrenia risk. This mechanism cannot,\nhowever, explain reports of higher fitness in siblings of\nschizophrenics compared to controls.\nSchizotypy may also be linked with other components of\nreproduction, given that Nettle and Clegg (2006) report an\nassociation in a non-clinical population between increased\nnumbers of mating partners and measures of schizotypy.\nThese authors provide evidence that this association is\nmediated by a positive correlation of the \u201cunusual experi-\nences\u201d dimension of schizotypy with creative activity, and\nwe suggest that enhanced theory-of-mind and language\nskills in healthy schizotypal individuals (especially rela-\ntively creative ones) may facilitate the efficacy of social\ninteractions in determining mating success.\nOur hypothesis also predicts that parents with more-\nautistic offspring should tend to have fewer children due\nto their increased costs. This prediction appears obvious\nfor cases of Kanner autism due to its high level of impair-\nment at an early age, but cases involving high-functioning\nautism or Asperger syndrome may provide useful tests.\nMales also appear to be physiologically more costly to\ngestate and rear than females (Gibson & Mace 2003;\nRickard et al. 2007; Tamimi et al. 2003), which is consist-\nent with a relatively higher cost of autistic children for\nmothers, to the extent that such children exhibit relatively\nmale-typical phenotypic traits. Conversely, relatively\nfemale phenotypes in children on the psychotic spectrum,\nas described in more detail later, may make them less\ncostly to rear.\nWhether behavioral aspects of the autistic-psychotic\nspectrum involve trade-offs between mentalistic and\nmechanistic cognition and abilities remains unclear.\nJarrold et al. (2000) found negative correlations, for a\nnon-clinical population and for autistics, between theory-\nof-mind skills and visual-spatial skills (block design and\nembedded-figures tests) when verbal mental age was con-\ntrolled, Johnson and Bouchard (2007) found a negative\nassociation between verbal skills and spatial-imagery\nskills, when the effects of general intelligence were\nremoved, and Nettle (2007) reported a significant negative\ncorrelation between Systemizing Quotient scores and\nEmpathizing Quotient scores in a non-clinical population.\nBy contrast, Carroll and Chiew (2006) found that System-\nizing Quotient and Empathizing Quotient scores were not\nsignificantly related across individuals, with or without\ncontrolling for age or verbal ability. In mice, an apparent\ngain of function mutation in the autism-associated\nNLGN3 gene is associated with impaired social inter-\naction but enhanced spatial learning ability (Tabuchi\net al. 2007), which suggests that such trade-offs may be\nmediated by single loci and relatively simple mechanisms,\nsuch as ratios of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic trans-\nmission. The neurocognitive basis for links of mechanistic\nand spatial skills with relatively \u201cselfish\u201d cognition and\nbehavior in autism also require investigation, although\nChen et al. (2007) describe how enhanced spatial skills,\nand reduced linguistic and mentalistic skills, may be\njointly mediated by the egocentric cognition characteristic\nof autism and Asperger syndrome. Similarly, Langdon\net al. (2006a) describe preserved spatial perspective-\ntaking in autism but impairments in perspectives involving\nbeliefs and intentions.\n7. Sex differences\nIf psychosis represents a phenotypic and genomic con-\nverse to autism, then it may exhibit a pattern of covariation\nwith sex opposite to the pattern observed in autism. Thus,\nas males score higher on tests of autistic tendencies\n(Baron-Cohen 2002; Baron-Cohen et al. 2005), females\ntend to score higher on standard indexes of schizotypal\ncognition, which quantify such traits as magical ideation\nand paranormal or spiritual experiences (Venables &\nBailes 1994; Williams & Barry 2003; see also Claridge\net al. 1997). Females also exhibit increased orienting to\ngaze cues compared to males (Bayliss et al. 2005), a\nmore highly developed mirror-neuron system (Cheng\net al. 2006), and enhanced autobiographic memory\n(Piefke & Fink 2005). Positive symptoms are relatively\nmore common in females than males with schizophrenia\nor schizotypy, and negative symptoms, more frequent in\nmales, are also more recalcitrant to treatment (Caligiuri\net al. 2005; Halbreich & Kahn 2003; Leung & Chue\n2000; Maric et al. 2003; Mata et al. 2000; Moriarty et al.\n2001; Ra\u00a8sa\u00a8nen et al. 2000; Salem & Kring 1998; Sharma\net al. 1999; Venables & Bailes 1994; Williams & Barry\n2003). However, the overall sex ratio in schizophrenia is\nsomewhat biased towards males (Aleman et al. 2003).\nWhereas autism tends to be much more severe when\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n258 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nexpressed in females (see Badcock & Crespi 2006; Holt-\nmann et al. 2007), schizophrenia is, on average, consider-\nably more severe on average in males than females\n(Halbreich & Kahn 2003; Maric et al. 2003; Mata et al.\n2000; Moriarty et al. 2001; Ra\u00a8sa\u00a8nen et al. 2000; Sharma\net al. 1999; Walder et al. 2006b; Williams & Barry 2003).\nThese diverse findings suggest that sex differences in\nautism versus schizotypy and schizophrenia mirror some\nof the differences between males and females. Baron-\nCohen (2003, p. 173) discussed the \u201cextreme female\nbrain\u201d as exhibiting high empathy and low systemizing\nability (in contrast to the reverse in autism), but he dis-\nmissed its role in psychological disorders on the presump-\ntion that hyperdeveloped theory-of-mind skills would be\naccurate and adaptive rather than pathological.\nSex differences in schizotypy and schizophrenia appear to\nbe related to sex differences in neuroanatomy. Thus, normal\nfemales exhibit lower levels of cerebral asymmetry on\naverage than males (Good et al. 2001; Kovalev et al. 2003;\nShaywitz et al. 1995; Yu\u00a8cel et al. 2001), especially in\nlanguage areas (Blanton et al. 2004; Josse & Tzourio-\nMazoyer 2004; Kovalev et al. 2003), a robust pattern that\nmatches the lower anatomical and functional asymmetry\nin schizotypy and schizophrenia compared to controls.\nFemales also may exhibit a relatively large corpus callosum\n(for brain size) compared to males (especially in the\nsplenia), although this difference is complex and disputed\n(e.g., Good et al. 2001; Highley et al. 2003; Mitchell et al.\n2003; Schoenemann 2006). Amygdala size is notably associ-\nated with sex, psychosis, and autism in the expected pattern.\nThus, normal males have a larger amygdala than females\n(Goldstein et al. 2001b; Good et al. 2001), and controlling\nfor sex, the amygdala is larger in autism and smaller in\nschizophrenia, asdescribedearlier.Guretal. (2004)describe\nhow, with regard to orbitofrontal cortex to amygdala ratios,\nschizophrenic men show \u201cfeminization,\u201d while women\nexhibit \u201cmasculinization.\u201d These patterns are especially\ntelling given the importance of the amygdala and orbitofron-\ntal cortex in functioning of the social brain (Burns 2004;\nSkuse et al. 2003), and the enhanced abilities of females in\ninterpretation of some social cues, such as those related to\nfear (McClure et al. 2004).Finally,Mendrek 2007) describes\na suite of evidence that schizophrenia engenders a pattern of\nreversed cerebral sexual dimorphism in structure and func-\ntion, mainly involving more \u201cfemale-typical\u201d traits in males;\nand Nakayama et al. (2007) report significantly higher\ncortisol levels in males with (female-typical) high scores\non the Empathy Quotient test, as well as in females with\n(male-typical) high scores on the Systemizing Quotient\ntest.\nContrasts have also been documented between some\nvisual-spatial skills (relative to verbal skills) being enhanced\nin autistic individuals and their first-order relatives (Baron-\nCohen et al. 2001, 2005; Bertone et al. 2005; Bo\u00a8lte &\nPoustka 2006), and specifically impaired in psychosis and\nschizotypy (Kravariti et al. 2006; Langdon & Coltheart\n2001; Toulopoulou et al. 2005), as well as velocardiofacial\nsyndrome (Lajiness-O\u2019Neill et al. 2006; Simon et al. 2002;\nZinkstok & van Amelsvoort 2005) and Prader-Willi\nsyndrome disomy cases (Roof et al. 2000; Whittington &\nHolland 2004). Parallel differences in visual-spatial versus\nverbal skills have been described between normal males\nand females (Baron-Cohen et al. 2005; Browne 2005;\nCrow et al. 1998; Gur et al. 2000; Kramer et al. 1996;\nLawrence 2006; Schoenemann 2006; Walder et al. 2006b).\nSome of these neuroanatomical and cognitive differences\nmay be mediated by differential effects of testosterone\nand estradiol in fetal development (Lutchmaya et al.\n2004; Mendrek 2007). Thus, autistic individuals exhibit a\nrelatively more male-typical pattern of 2 : 4 digit length\nratio, but schizophrenics and subjects with schizotypal\npersonality disorder show a relatively more female-\ntypical pattern (Arato\u00b4 et al. 2004; Manning et al. 2001;\n2002; 2004; Milne et al. 2006; Walder et al. 2006a);\nmore-female digit lengths are also associated with higher\nscores on a depression scale in a non-clinical population\n(Bailey & Hurd 2005).\nBased on the evidence described above, we hypothesize\nthat a maternal\u2013paternal imprinting axis of cognition, and\nan axis based on male\u2013female differences, jointly explain\nkey aspects of the sex biases and differences found for\nautistic- and psychotic-spectrum conditions (Fig. 6). By\nthis model, the two axes overlap partially but broadly\nwith one another, such that the so-called male brain is\nrelatively similar, neuroanatomically and cognitively, to a\nbrain biased towards increased influence of paternally\nexpressed imprinted genes. This overlap explains the\nmale sex-ratio bias and male-typical traits found in\nautism, and the association between less-extreme impair-\nment and a more male-biased sex ratio (in high-functioning\nautism and Asperger syndrome). Conversely, a \u201cmore-\nfemale\u201d brain is similar to a brain developing under a rela-\ntively strong influence of maternally expressed imprinted\ngenes, which explains the female bias in positive-\nsymptom schizotypy and schizophrenia. The most severe\nneurological and cognitive impairments are found, in\nboth disorders, where the direction of genomic-imprinting\ndysregulation opposes the sex difference: in females with\nautism, and in males with schizophrenia. This hypothesis\nmay also help to explain some of the many striking neuroa-\nnatomical andother differences between females andmales\nwith schizophrenia (e.g., DeLisi et al. 2002; Highley et al.\n2003; Troisi et al. 2001; see also Cahill et al. 2004), as\nwell as the more female-like hormonal profiles of male\nschizophrenics with predominantly negative symptoms\n(Akhondzadeh et al. 2006; Simpson et al. 2003), a high\nprevalence of homosexual ideation in male schizophrenics\n(Planansky & Johnston 1962), the female-biased sex ratio\nin major depression (e.g., Piccinelli & Wilkinson 2000),\nand the relatively high incidences of psychosis in Kline-\nfelter syndrome (Boks et al. 2007a; DeLisi et al. 2005;\nvan Rijn et al. 2005) and autism in Turner syndrome\n(Skuse 2005).\n8. Discussion\nJulian Huxley and Ernst Mayr, two architects of the\nModern Synthesis of biology, stated in 1964 that \u201cschizo-\nphrenia constitutes not a purely medical or psychiatric\nbut a biological problem, with opportunities for a com-\nbined attack in many fields \u2013 genetics, biochemistry,\nselection theory, psychology, psychiatry, public health,\ndemography, social science, pathology, and general\nenvironmental and reproductive physiology\u201d (Huxley\net al. 1964, p. 220). We have tried to marshall such a coor-\ndinated attack, on both psychotic and autistic conditions,\nwith evolutionary biology as guide and inspiration, and\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 259\ngenomic imprinting as a simple mechanism that helps to\nconnect genetic and epigenetic variation with cognition.\nOur hypothesis can be conceptualized at two interacting\nlevels: (1) the diametric architecture of autistic- and psy-\nchotic-spectrum conditions (Badcock 2004), and (2) the\nunderpinnings of this structure in dysregulated genomic\nimprinting. A diametric structure to autism and schizo-\nphrenia has been considered for some traits before: thus,\nAbu-Akel (1999) and Abu-Akel and Bailey (2000) implied\nthat autism and schizophrenia represent extremes on a\ncontinuum of theory-of-mind skills ranging from the defi-\ncits commonly found in autism to \u201chyper-theory of mind\u201d\nin schizophrenia, C. D. Frith (2004) described \u201cunder-\nmentalizing\u201d in autism and \u201cover-mentalizing\u201d in paranoia,\nand Nettle (2006) anticipated an autism-psychosis spec-\ntrum in noting that \u201cautistic traits are in many ways the\nconverse of the unusual experiences component of schizo-\ntypy.\u201d Similarly, the well-known autistic Donna Williams\n(1992, p. 204) considered autism and schizophrenia as\nopposite conditions along a scale of \u201cdegree of sensitivity\nof an automatic cut-off mechanism that stops emotional\noverload,\u201d with the mechanism underdeveloped, oversen-\nsitive, and triggered too easily in autism. Most previous\nresearch and writing on autism and psychosis has, by con-\ntrast, considered the disorders to be etiologically unrelated\n(or has considered the negative symptoms of schizo-\nphrenia in terms of autism), although both disorders are\nbelieved to be underlain by dysregulated development of\nthe social brain (Broks 1997; Burns 2004; 2006a; Emery\n2000). By our hypothesis, autism and psychosis represent\nextremes on a continuum of human cognitive architecture\nfrom mechanistic to mentalistic cognition, with balanced\ncognition at the center (Fig. 4). Each set of conditions is\nextremely heterogeneous but also highly convergent, in\nthat diverse genetic, epigenetic, and environmental\neffects can generate similar cognitive phenotypes\n(Badcock & Crespi 2006; Happe\u00b4 1994, p. 2; Happe\u00b4 et al.\n2006; Keverne 1999; Seeman et al. 2005). These striking\nconvergences are mediated, in our view, by the dynamics\nof social brain development, with underdevelopment in\nautistic conditions and hyperdevelopment in psychotic\nconditions (Badcock 2004), as shown at the cores of\nFigures 1 and 2. Further tests of this hypothesis should\nfocus on assessing the breadth and depth of diametric phe-\nnotypic structure to autistic- and psychotic-spectrum con-\nditions, and testing for trade-offs between mentalistic and\nmechanistic thought and ability.\nA role for genomic imprinting in the diametric structure\nof autistic and psychotic conditions is based on inclusive\nfitness theory, which explains how alleles affecting inter-\nactions between kin have evolved (Alexander 1979; Hamil-\nton 1964). Inclusive fitness theory provides the\nevolutionary foundation for understanding animal and\nhuman social behavior (Alexander 1979; 1987; 1989), so\napplying it to understanding disorders of the social\nbrain, the core of human behavior, may lead to useful\ninsights. Such applications are not always straightforward.\nIn particular, developmental systems subject to genomic\nimprinting effects are expected to resemble dynamic\ntugs-of-war, whose disruption should lead to relative\nmaternal-gene or paternal-gene benefit only for small\ndeviations, beyond which we expect pathological effects\nbeneficial to no one. Separating adaptation from maladap-\ntation can be extremely difficult for psychological traits\n(Nesse 2005), and requires knowledge of genetic, epi-\ngenetic, and developmental mechanisms (Crespi 2000).\nBoth non-imprinted and imprinted genes obviously con-\ntribute to the neurodevelopmental and physiological pro-\ncesses involved in autistic- and psychotic-spectrum\nconditions (Crespi, under revision). Our hypothesis should\ntherefore be considered in terms of both genomic imprinting\neffects on growth, development, cognition, and behavior,\nand causal factors that are distinct from genomic imprinting\nbut may also include maternal\u2013fetal conflict mediated by\nnon-imprinted genes. The relative contributions of these\nprocesses to the etiologies of autistic- and psychotic-spec-\ntrum conditions are as yet unclear, but evidence for\nparent-of-origin effects in these disorders is extensive\n(Crespi, under revision). Thus, although few of the genes\nlinked so far with autism are known to be imprinted,\nrecent evidence implicates the imprinted gene UBE3A\nand the imprinting-regulation gene MeCP2 in autism,\nFigure 6. The interaction of sex differences and genomic-imprinting effects can clarify major features of the autistic and psychotic\nspectra. The worst impairments in these conditions are found where the direction of sex-difference effects opposes the direction of\ngenomic-imprinting effects: in males with schizophrenia, and females with autism.\nCrespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n260 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nAngelman syndrome, and Rett Syndrome (Samaco et al.\n2004; 2005). Similarly, a strong parent-of-origin effect for\nboth schizophrenia risk and relative hand skill has been\nfound for the chromosomal region 2p12-q11 by Francks\net al. (2003a; 2003b), who noted that their findings suggest\nthat \u201clateralized development of the human brain, and\ncomplex human cognitive abilities, have been subject to a\nparental conflict over investment\u201d (Francks et al. 2003b,\np. 3227). One of the largest meta-analyses of schizophrenia\ngenome scans to date showed that this region of chromo-\nsome 2 exhibited the only linkage signal reaching genome-\nwide significance (Lewis et al. 2003), and Francks et al.\n(2007) have recently demonstrated the apparent genetic\nbasis of this linkage, in showing that a haplotype of the\nimprinted, paternally expressed gene LRRTM1 at 2p12 is\nassociated with increased schizophrenia risk and left-\nhandedness. Our imprinted-brain hypothesis predicts that\nthe risk haplotype should involve lower expression of this\ngene, or reduced activity of its product, either of which\nwould generate a relative bias towards maternal-gene\neffects. Further tests of a role for genomic imprinting in\nthe development of autistic and psychotic conditions\nshould focus on identification and functional characterization\nof brain-expressed imprinted genes, and tests for parent of\norigin effects on the inheritance of autistic and psychotic\nphenotypes, especially those that underlie mentalistic skills.\nSeveral important theoretical and clinical implications\nfollow from the conceptualization of a continuum between\nautistic- and psychotic-spectrum conditions. First, diametric\nphenotypes in autism and psychosis provide a simple predic-\ntive framework for future studies that may reciprocally illu-\nminate the causes and correlates of both sets of conditions.\nIs the cholinergic system differentially affected in each dis-\norder, given high rates of self-medication via smoking in\nschizophrenics (De Luca et al. 2004; Ripoll et al. 2004),\nbut apparent low rates of smoking in autistic adults\n(Bejerot & Nylander 2003; Lippiello 2006)? Is the well-\nreplicated lower cancer risk in schizophrenia (Barak et al.\n2005; Dalton et al. 2005b; Goldacre et al. 2005; Levav\net al. 2007) paralleled by a higher risk in autism (Ingudom-\nnukul et al. 2007)? Do reductions in olfactory and nocicep-\ntive sensitivity in schizophrenia and schizotypy (Mohr et al.\n2001; Singh et al. 2006) represent a neurologically based\ncontrast with apparently enhanced smell and pain percep-\ntion in autistic children (Bursch et al. 2004; Cascio et al.\n2008; Rogers et al. 2003)? Can autism be characterized as\na condition strongly mediated by early childhood over-\ngrowth of the body and brain (Mraz et al. 2007; Sacco\net al. 2007), while schizophrenia-risk is associated with child-\nhood undergrowth (Saugstad 1999; Wahlbeck et al. 2001a)?\nSecond, some conditions such as obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder (OCD) and ADHD have been reported as highly\ncomorbid in both autism and schizophrenia (e.g., Bejerot\n2007; Hattori et al. 2006; Kayahan et al. 2005; Leyfer et al.\n2006; Ross et al. 2006b). By our hypothesis, OCD or\nADHD in autistic-spectrum conditions should be funda-\nmentally distinct from OCD or ADHD in psychotic-spec-\ntrum conditions (see, e.g., Bu\u00a8rgy 2007; Goos et al. 2007), a\nprediction that, if supported, strongly impacts on nosology,\ndiagnosis, and treatment. Similar conditions may apply to\npsychopathy, which has been attributed to subtypes of\nschizophrenia as well as to Asperger syndrome (e.g., Abu-\nAkel & Abushua\u2019leh 2004; Blair 2005; Haskins & Silva\n2006). Finally, therapies to reduce hyper-mentalistic\ncognition in subjects with psychotic-spectrum conditions\nmay be just as useful as the encouragement of mentalistic\nabilities in autistics, given that impaired theory of mind in\nschizophrenia is not a deficit somuch as a suite of alternative\nhyperdevelopments (Abu-Akel 1999; Badcock 2004).\nAs W. D. Hamilton (2005, p. 205) has noted, we live in a\nworld of things and a world of people. An autistic-psycho-\ntic continuum can usefully be conceptualized in these\noverly simplistic terms, although the real world is much\nmore nuanced and complex than our broad, crude\nstrokes can depict. The usefulness of inclusive fitness\ntheory and evolutionary biology in psychiatry, psychology,\nand neuroscience may ultimately be gauged by the insights\nthat they can provide into the genetic, developmental, and\nevolutionary bases of the social brain and its disorders.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nBernard Crespi is grateful to NSERC and the Canada Council for the\nArts for financial support.

By viewing human cognition\nimpairment in terms of competence and performance, a variety of\nsocial brain disorders can be identified along the autistic-psychotic\ncontinuum.\nThe target article discusses disorders affecting the social brain on\n\u201ca continuum of human cognitive architecture from mechanistic\nto mentalistic cognition\u201d (sect. 8, para. 2) in which autism and\nschizophrenia are the extremes. Within these extremes, there is\na variety of conditions that manifest varying degrees of distur-\nbances to the social brain. Theory of mind, which is the ability\nto represent and apply mental states to both self and other, has\nbecome a corollary construct by which we evaluate social cogni-\ntion in developmental and psychiatric disorders. Theory-of-mind\nimpairment can thus be a result of a disturbance in the ability to\nrepresent mental states to self and\/or other (i.e., an impairment\nof competence), as well as in the ability to apply mental states to\nself and\/or other (i.e., an impairment of performance).\nBy invoking the competence-performance theory of mind para-\ndigm (Abu-Akel 2003), we are now in a position to introduce some\nof the in-between cases to the extremes proposed by Crespi &\nBadcock (C&B). Impairment of competence is associated with\nindividuals with autism who lose the ability to manifest an under-\nstanding of both self and other\u2019s mental states. Schizophrenic\npatients with passivity phenomena also fall within this category.\nThese individuals, however, appear only to lose their ability to rep-\nresent their own mental states (Mlakar et al. 1994). Impairment of\nperformance, on the other hand, is associated with individuals with\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 261\ndelusional and paranoid schizophrenia, negative symptom schizo-\nphrenia, and Asperger\u2019s syndrome. In the case of paranoid or delu-\nsional schizophrenia, we observe theory of mind impairments that\nresult from an over-attribution of mental states to self or others\n(i.e., hyper-theory of mind) (Abu-Akel & Bailey 2000). Asperger\u2019s\nsyndrome and negative symptom schizophrenia seem to maintain\nan understanding of mental states, but have a deficit in the ability\ntomanifest this understanding in real-life situations (Bowler 1992).\nBowler has shown that although patients with Asperger\u2019s syn-\ndrome as well as patients with negative symptom schizophrenia\nperform well on theory-of-mind tasks in laboratory settings, they\nfailed to demonstrate their knowledge of mental states in real life.\nThe C&B autistic-psychotic continuum can therefore be further\nenhanced by incorporating how disorders of the social brain vary\nalong the lines of their ability to represent mental states (i.e., com-\npetence) as well as their ability to apply mental states (i.e., perform-\nance). It would be intriguing to uncover the extent to which\ndisorders of performance and disorders of competence are etiologi-\ncally related, within and across groups of disorders, in terms of the\nrole genetic imprinting has in the development of social cognition.\nMapping autism and schizophrenia onto\nthe ontogenesis of social behaviour: A\nhierarchical-developmental rather than\ndiametrical perspective\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004238\nRalf-Peter Behrendt\nConsultant Psychiatrist, The Retreat Hospital, York, YO10 5BN, United\nKingdom.\nrp.behrendt@btinternet.com\nAbstract: Co-morbidity of schizophrenia and autism is low because\ninterpersonal concerns of schizophrenic patients presuppose developmental\nachievements that are absent in autism. Autism may arise if primary anxiety\nis not overcome at a key developmental stage by affective synchronisation\nbetween infant and caregiver. Schizophrenic patients will have learned to\nregulate primitive anxiety by affectively attuning to narrow social networks\nbut remain highly vulnerable to exclusion from larger groups.\nInfants are born with a bias to track and fixate face-like stimuli\n(Johnson et al. 1991; Valenza et al. 1996). Innate perceptual pro-\npensities guide learning and ensure that the developing brain\nreceives preferential input from the social environment (Johnson\n2001). Newborns are also predisposed to express emotional\nstates by facial expressions and vocalizations (Izard 1994).\nDuring short face-to-face interactions, infant and mother attune\nto each other\u2019s affective expressions. Synchronized interactions\nbetween maternal and infant affective states are crucial for the\ninfant\u2019s social development (Feldman et al. 1999). An inborn ten-\ndency to imitate affective expressions enables infants to re-experi-\nence (Adolphs et al. 2000) emotional states of caregivers, learn\nabout the association of these states with the satisfaction of\nneeds, and develop conditioned \u201cplace preference\u201d to them.\nCerebellar abnormalities in autism are associated with deficits in\norienting to visual cues (Harris et al. 1999; Townsend et al. 1999).\nDeficits in orienting toward human stimuli may represent the\nprimary manifestation of the pathological process in autism\n(Maestro et al. 2002), causing social deficits by depriving infants\nof opportunities to learn about the significance of caregiver\u2019s\nemotional expressions. Lack of imitative interaction \u2013 possibly\nsecondary to deficits in tendencies to preferentially perceive\nfacial features \u2013 contributes to autistic development, as suggested\nby observations that systematic exposure to imitative interaction\nlater in life can improve social deficits in autism (Escalona et al.\n2002; Field et al. 2001).\nGiven that social recognition depends on oxytocin receptor acti-\nvation in the medial amygdala (Ferguson et al. 2002), lack of oxy-\ntocin or disorder of the amygdala may impair learning of the\nsignificance of caregiver\u2019s expressions. In autism, oxytocin precur-\nsor peptide is processed abnormally (Green et al. 2001), preventing\nthe age-dependent increase in oxytocin plasma concentrations\n(Modahl et al. 1998). Although some studies report the amygdala\nis disinhibited or larger in autism, which Crespi & Badcock\n(C&B) suggest indicates heightened activation in response to\ndirect gaze \u2013 leading in turn to fear and gaze avoidance; others\nfound no amygdala enlargement (Aylward et al. 1999) or enlarge-\nment that is proportional to overall increases of cerebral volume\n(Sparks et al. 2002). It would be premature to generally implicate\namygdala hyperactivity in autism, given also that amygdala\nlesions inflicted in monkeys after birth produce an autism-like\npattern of social deficits (Machado & Bachevalier 2003; Schultz\n& Klin 2002).\nInfants who develop autism may be less endowed \u2013 due to\nconstitutional deficits \u2013 with primary anxiety, which expresses\nitself in distress vocalisations that elicit affective synchronisation\nwith the mother. Autistic individuals were often perceived as\nplacid during infanthood. Primary anxiety goes on to develop\ninto complex social behaviours designed to elicit acceptance\nand a sense of inclusion from significant others or social groups\n(see Fig. 1). Midline cerebral cortices, which are implicated in\nregulation of anxiety, show lower baseline activity in autism and\ntherefore less deactivation during distracting cognitive tasks\n(Kennedy et al. 2006). If adaptive anxiety-related behaviours\nfail to achieve their interpersonal or social objective, overt\nanxiety re-emerges. Positive symptoms in schizophrenia imply\nincreased anxiety; indeed, stronger positive symptoms were\nassociated with increased midline cerebral activity at rest and\ngreater task-induced deactivation (Garrity et al. 2007).\nInterpersonal relationships and social networks not only help\nto overcome primary anxiety, but they also expose to intraspeci-\nfic aggression, which is woven into social phenomena (Behrendt\n2006a; 2006c; Lorenz 1963\/2002). For schizophrenics, human\nrelatedness is fraught with terror; they cannot overcome their\nfear of others because of early-life experiences (Behrendt\n2006d; Gabbard 1990). Superego is a metaphor for internalised\nparental punishment, which importantly contributes to chil-\ndren\u2019s socialisation. Schizophrenics show higher sensitivity to\nthreat and punishment (Scholten et al. 2006) and develop a\nsevere and persecutory superego. The clinical picture of schizo-\nphrenia \u201coften reflects some of the most brutal morality,\u201d\nattributable to an archaic superego \u201cin which the primal identi-\nfication (incorporated figure of the mother) holds forth only the\npromise of condemnation, abandonment and consequent\ndeath\u201d (Rosenfeld 1965, p. 66). Cognitive skills based on left\nfrontal cortices are required for socially adaptive expression of\nintraspecific aggression and affiliative approach, thus balancing\nfear and withdrawal impulses mediated by the right hemi-\nsphere. Relative left-hemisphere dysfunction in schizophrenia\nmay undermine cognitive capacities at the service of social\napproach functions and engender a predominance of right-\nhemisphere-based social withdrawal functions (Demaree et al.\n2005) (see Fig. 1).\nReduction in \u201cmentalistic cognition\u201d (\u201ctheory-of-mind\u201d deficit)\nis not specific to autism (Pennington & Ozonoff 1996; Rowe\net al. 2001) and may not lie at its pathogenetic core.

The theory\ncould be usefully rooted and developed with reference to the lower-\nlevel perceptual and attentional phenomena from which social cognitive\nmodules are developmentally refined.\nThere is a certain mechanistic appeal in theoretical science\u2019s\ntypes and dimensions of personality. If we can believe in them,\nsuch paradigms hold out to us the hope of rendering a welter\nof human differences comprehensible in terms of cause and\neffect, and quantifiable in terms of position along some funda-\nmental axis. To the extent that such models are valid, they\ngarner a great deal in terms of predictive, explanatory, or at\nleast descriptive power. To the extent that they are invalid,\nthey lose a great deal in the projection of multifaceted reality\nonto flat theory. So theoretical abstractions are useful only\ninsofar as they remain grounded in the phenomena that they\npurport to describe. Crespi & Badcock (C&B) are keenly\naware of this tension between theory and phenomenon, symbol\nand referent, and this is why they conclude with an apology for\n\u201coverly simplistic terms\u201d and \u201cbroad, crude strokes.\u201d Despite\nthis acknowledged coarseness of their model, C&B have little\nfor which to apologise \u2013 for it is the very breadth and force of\nsuch strokes that carries science across ideological limits and\ninto new territories.\nLike Baron-Cohen\u2019s (2002) empathising\u2013systemising duality,\nwhich it extends and supplants, this mentalism\u2013mechanism\nduality has something of an Aristotelian feel. Indeed, it recalls\nmedicine\u2019s first explanations of disease in terms of imbalance of\nthe humours. In terms comprehensible to the ancient Greeks we\nmight define the psychotic spectrum as an excess of the mentalistic\nhumour and the autism spectrum as an excess of the mechanistic\nhumour, and observe that these imbalances can be associated with\nunusual cognitive skills \u2013 just as Aristotle characterised what we\nFigure 1 (Behrendt). In the absence of a caregiver or affective synchronisation with the caregiver, existential anxiety manifests in\ndistress vocalisations. Learning to manipulate the caregiver\u2019s affective states, thus reducing one\u2019s own anxiety, is a foundational step\nin social development disturbed in autism. Schizophrenics have learned that inclusion in social networks \u2013 while potentially\nexposing them to others\u2019 aggression \u2013 reduces anxiety; however, underdeveloped social approach behaviour later necessitates\npsychotic resolution of anxiety.

The difference, of\ncourse, is that we don\u2019t imagine our humoural abstractions as\nunitary, physical substances. Rather, we are aware that at\ngenetic and biochemical levels of analysis these mentalistic and\nmechanistic humours are implemented by dauntingly complex\ngenetic networks which interact with the environment and with\neach other as development unfolds. This underlying complexity,\nthough, is precisely the condition that makes these insubstantial\nhumours so useful: In parallel with efforts to describe autism\nand schizophrenia in terms of network interactions among specific\ngenes, we can now describe these conditions in terms of classes of\ngenes united by their selection for maternal and paternal repro-\nductive fitness. Thus, the work of C&B enables a trait-level analy-\nsis of autism and psychosis that complements gene-level analysis.\nAs C&B point out, this trait-level view in terms of mentalism\nand mechanism can in some regards muster greater descriptive\nand explanatory power than the more immediate view in terms\nof paternally and maternally imprinted genes themselves,\nbecause abnormal biases constructed by such genes can interact\nwith normal programmes and gradients of brain development,\nspurring knock-on effects as the process of interactive specialis-\nation of neural and cognitive systems unfolds (Johnson et al.\n2002; Karmiloff-Smith 2007). Support for the notion of such\nmulti-level cascades of perturbed development comes from\nstudies of schizophrenia demonstrating deficits in early sensory\nprocessing (Butler & Javitt 2005; Butler et al. 2007; Uhlhaas &\nSilverstein 2005) and relating auditory frequency discrimination\nto deficits in affect recognition (Leitman et al. 2007) and visual\nsize discrimination to deficits in theory of mind (Uhlhaas et al.\n2006); from studies of autism demonstrating enhanced percep-\ntion of first-order stimuli (Mottron et al. 2006) and associating\ntheory-of-mind performance with joint attention (Charman\n1997) and perceptual disembedding (Jarrold et al. 2000); and\nfrom models relating C&B\u2019s cited variations in brain size to\nsystems-level variation in the balance between short-distance\nand long-distance connectivities (Lewis & Elman 2008). In\neach of these instances, what seems on face an alteration of\nhigher-order cognition is seen to be related to, and in some\ncases a consequence of, perturbations at lower levels of proces-\nsing \u2013 and in this regard the cited conditions are not disorders\nof the \u201csocial brain\u201d exclusively. Though such relationships may\nbe most obvious in cases of clinical disorders, they seem unlikely\nto be limited to disordered cognition and instead may extend to\nnormal variation \u2013 that is, to the entire continuum of cognitive\nvariation between the mentalistic and mechanistic extremes.\nFurther refinement will be necessary to explore aspects in\nwhich the autism spectrum and the less straightforwardly\ndefined \u201cpsychotic spectrum\u201d may have been miscast as opposites.\nAs C&B note, some empirical aspects are not comparable between\nthese two populations with existing data. Schizophrenia is diag-\nnosed much later than autism, and therefore there remains a\ndearth of early developmental observations. For example,\nalthough the autistic amygdala is indeed abnormally large during\nchildhood and therefore seems a counterpoint to the abnormally\nsmall amygdala in schizophrenia, by adulthood the autistic amyg-\ndala likewise has become abnormally small (Aylward et al. 1999;\nRojas et al. 2004). Likewise, observations of frontal hypoactivation\nin autism may depend strongly on the behavioural task and on the\nlatency at which activation is measured \u2013 in some contexts autistic\nfrontal systems are hyperactivated (Takarae et al. 2007). Regarding\nsensory filtering, autism shares with schizophrenia a decrease in\nprepulse inhibition (McAlonan et al. 2002; Perry et al. 2007),\nand although people with autism do often focus attention very\nstrongly, in some cases maintaining attention is an issue, and\nmany people with autism fulfill criteria for attention-deficit\/hyper-\nactivity disorder (Corbett & Constantine 2006). Familial associ-\nation of autism and mood disorders (DeLong 2004) calls into\nquestion the inclusion of mood disorders within the \u201cpsychotic\nspectrum\u201d in this context. The connectivity issues too remain to\nbe sorted out; both autism and schizophrenia have been described\nas deficits in brain connectivity (Frith 2005a), but these may be\nsecondary to developmental interactions whose antecedents\ndiffer between the two conditions. Despite such areas for refine-\nment, the mentalism\u2013mechanism duality has strong potential to\nchange the way we think about the relation of clinical disorders\nto normal human cognitive variation, as well as the evolutionary\nforces that have produced both.\nAnimal models may help fractionate shared\nand discrete pathways underpinning\nschizophrenia and autism\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004251\nThomas H.

We argue that animal models related to\nschizophrenia and autism provide a useful platform to explore the\nmechanisms outlined by C&B. We also note that schizophrenia and\nautism share certain risk factors such as advanced paternal age. Apart\nfrom genomic imprinting, copy number variants related to advanced\npaternal age may also contribute to the differential trajectory of brain\ndevelopment associated with autism and schizophrenia.\nCrespi & Badcock (C&B) suggest that two poorly understood\nneuropsychiatric syndromes, autism and schizophrenia, can be\nconceptualized as diametrical, opposed disorders. They suggest\nthe root of the divergence is a disruption of maternally versus\npaternally imprinted genes, which serves as a switch point,\nafter which the affected individual is shunted down either the\nschizophrenia or the autism tracks. C&B array a wide range of\nevidence to support this ambitious hypothesis. Hypotheses like\nthese are intrinsically appealing \u2013 we all desperately wish the\ncomplexity of neurobiology could be so easily condensed!\nWhat type of results, from what type of experiment, would\nallow us to confidently reject the hypothesis outlined by C&B?\nHypotheses linking early life exposures (genetic and non-\ngenetic) and later neuropsychiatric syndromes are notoriously\ndifficult to test. This is particularly the case for syndromes such\nas schizophrenia where the disorder may not be apparent until\nthe second or third decade of life (McGrath et al. 2003).\nAlthough clinical research is clearly important, we suggest that\nanimal models remain the only practical tool for unravelling the\nmechanisms behind early life disruptions that may lead to adult\nneuropsychiatric disorders. The developing human brain is not\nopen to ready observation, and experimental manipulations of\nnormal brain developmental are clearly neither ethical nor feas-\nible. Rats and mice do not \u201cget\u201d schizophrenia or autism \u2013 so\nanimal models will never recapitulate the full phenotype of dis-\norders involving higher cognitive function. However, they\nprovide an experimental platform that allows the researchers to\nfocus on more substrate-pure neurobiological correlates of clini-\ncal syndromes (e.g., brain structure or animal behaviour)\n(Arguello & Gogos 2006).\nAnimal studies allow the examination of both candidate genes\nand environmental exposures on brain development either in\nvitro or at the whole animal level. In such investigations outcomes\nas narrow as regional gene expression right up to social behaviour\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n264 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\ncan be studied. Animal models in schizophrenia research have\nexplored the impact of early life exposure to various candidate\nrisk factors. For example, animal models in schizophrenia research\nhave included postnatal lesioning of selected brain areas (Lipska\net al. 1995), prenatal exposure to specific viruses like influenza\n(Fatemi et al. 2000), and prenatal nutritional deficiencies (Eyles\net al. 2003; Kesby et al. 2006). Various animal models of autism\nare being similarly explored (Crawley 2007; Moy et al. 2007).\nTo make their case, C&B have focused on divergence between\nschizophrenia and autism. We would like to draw attention to two\ninteresting areas of convergence between schizophrenia and\nautism: namely, prenatal infection, and advanced paternal age.\nEarly life exposure to infection has been associated with an\nincreased risk of autism (Libbey et al. 2005) and schizophrenia\n(Brown 2006). Prenatal infection models in animals are proving\ninformative for both autism and schizophrenia research (Fatemi\net al. 2007; Hornig et al. 1999). The evidence linking prenatal\ninfection has led to rodent models of maternal immune activation.\nThese models, which use non-infective viral (Poly I:C) or bacterial-\nlike components (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) to trigger innate\nimmune systems, have produced informative behavioural pheno-\ntypes (Meyer et al. 2006a; 2006b).\nAdvanced paternal age has also been linked with an increased\nrisk of both schizophrenia and autism. Malaspina et al. (2001)\nreported that, compared with offspring of fathers younger than\nage 25 years, the relative risk of schizophrenia was 2.96 in offspring\nof men aged 50 years or more. Several other groups have repli-\ncated this association (El-Saadi et al. 2004; Sipos et al. 2004). It\nhas also been shown that the offspring of men aged 40 or above\nhave a nearly six-fold increase risk of autism spectrum disorders\ncompared to the offspring of men younger than age 30 (Reichen-\nberg et al. 2006). Advanced paternal age may be contributing to\nthe transgenerational accumulation of copy error mutations\n(Crow 2000; Keller & Miller 2006). Alternately, epigenetic pro-\ncesses may be compromised in the sperm of older fathers. The\nresultant alterations in developmental gene structure and\/or\nexpression could both contribute to the increased risk of schizo-\nphrenia in the offspring of older fathers (Perrin et al. 2007).\nOnce again, studying the impact of advance paternal age on\ngenomic fidelity and structural and behavioural phenotypes is feas-\nible in inbred animal strains.\nMany different factors could contribute to the differential tra-\njectory of brain development found in schizophrenia and\nautism \u2013 this is acknowledged by C&B in their introduction. In\nthe light of this commentary, we would like to propose an alterna-\ntive hypothesis. Advanced paternal age may lead to both point\nmutations (Crow 2000) and small de novo chromosomal\nrearrangements (e.g., copy number variations) and DNA repeat\nexpansions (Pearson et al. 2005; Perrin et al. 2007). There is\nincreasing evidence that many neurological disorders, including\nautism, are associated with such small genomic rearrangements\n(Lee & Lupski 2006; Lupski 2007; Sebat et al. 2007). Indeed,\nPrader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, which are discussed in\ndetail by C&B, are classic examples of small chromosomal\nrearrangements (Emanuel & Saitta 2007). Velocardiofacial syn-\ndrome, a deletion syndrome involving Chr 22q11.2, is strongly\nassociated with both schizophrenia and autistic spectrum dis-\norders (Vorstman et al. 2006). Certain types of genomic\nrearrangements are particularly likely to occur in regions of the\ngenome enriched with short nucleotide repeats (e.g., trinucleo-\ntide repeats), expansions of which are already linked to a range\nof neurological disorders (Nithianantharajah & Hannan 2007).\nThe fact that disease-associated repeat expansion is a phenom-\nenon that seems unique to humans (Pearson et al. 2005) may\nappeal to those interested in theories linking human neuropsy-\nchiatric disorder to recent evolutionary forces. We propose that\nthe one general mechanism could contribute to susceptibility\nto both schizophrenia and autism (and probably a wide range\nof other disorders). However, variations in the location and\n\u201cdose\u201d of the rearrangements could then be translated to relative\nbrain overgrowth versus undergrowth, as emergent properties of\nthe complex systems governing brain development. These\nrearrangements may or may not include genomic segments\nmaternally or paternally imprinted.\nWe hope that the hypothesis outlined by C&B will stimulate\nresearch that links schizophrenia and autism. We argue that\nanimal models provide the most efficient platform to explore the\nhidden layers of complexity underlying normal and perturbed\nbrain development. In particular, animal models may help fraction-\nate which neurobiological mechanisms are shared between schizo-\nphrenia and autism, versus which are discrete for the two disorders.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the support of the National Health and Medical\nResearch Council of Australia.\nGenomic imprinting and disorders of the\nsocial brain; shades of grey rather than\nblack and white\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004263\nWilliam Davies and Anthony R.

The basic premise is that maternally expressed genes are\npredicted to promote hypermentalistic behaviours, and paternally\nexpressed genes hypomentalistic behaviours. The authors provide a\ndetailed overview of data supporting their ideas, but as we discuss,\ncaution should be applied in interpreting these data.\nAlong with their comprehensive review in the target article, Crespi\n& Badcock (C&B) present an intriguing, if rather speculative, new\nhypothesis which attempts to reconcile imprinted gene dysfunc-\ntion with abnormal brain development and vulnerability to neu-\nropsychiatric disorder. The central tenet of the article is that\npsychosis and autism represent phenotypes at opposite ends of a\nneurodevelopmental spectrum, and that the disruption of pater-\nnally expressed imprinted genes may predispose to one disorder,\nwhereas the disruption of maternally expressed imprinted genes\nmay predispose to the \u201copposite\u201d disorder. C&B\u2019s detailed discus-\nsion represents an extension of ideas relating to the role that\nimprinted genes play in social behaviour, which has been\nalluded to by others previously (Brown & Consedine 2004; Haig\n2000a; Isles & Holland 2005; Isles et al. 2006). Imprinted genes\n(i.e., genes that are epigenetically marked such that they are mono-\nallelically expressed in a parent-of-origin dependent manner) are\ncurrently an extremely hot topic in behavioural genetics, given\ntheir important role in key neurodevelopmental processes (Wilkin-\nson et al. 2007). Thus, this review is timely and provides novel tes-\ntable ideas regarding the role of these fascinating genes in\nconferring vulnerability to mental disorder.\nTo assess the utility of the proposals contained within the\ntarget article, it is necessary to answer two pertinent questions:\nFirst, can we really say that autism and psychosis are diametrical\ndisorders of the social brain? Second, what is the evidence for\n(oppositely) imprinted gene dysfunction in these disorders?\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 265\nOn the first point, the authors themselves point out that much of\ntheir evidence comes from complex, multigenic disorders where\npsychosis or autistic traits are endophenotypes. The type of psycho-\nsis, neuroanatomy, and cognitive function are likely to be extremely\nheterogeneous both within, and between, each so-called psychotic-\nspectrum condition, making the grouping of these conditions\ntogether as a single entity a potentially hazardous practice. For\nexample, the genetic abnormalities that cause gross developmental\nabnormalities such as reduced brain size or low birth weight in\nschizophrenia are likely to be significantly different from those pro-\nducing a similar outcome in other psychotic-spectrum conditions.\nIndeed, in some psychotic-spectrum conditions (such as psychotic\nbipolar disorder), reduced brain size may not be apparent (McDo-\nnald et al. 2006), making generalisations about psychotic-spectrum\ndisorders nigh on impossible. It is also relevant to consider the\nspecificity and extent of the \u201copposite\u201d phenotypes of autism spec-\ntrum and psychotic-spectrum disorders. The authors have high-\nlighted a number of endophenotypes that differ between the two\ntypes of disorder (bearing in mind the caveat outlined above);\nhowever, the two types of disorder share many similarities. For\nexample, dysfunction of attentional and inhibitory processes\n(both fundamental to normal social functioning) is common to\nmany neuropsychiatric disorders ranging from autism to schizo-\nphrenia to bipolar disorder.\nIn answering the second question posed above, it is necessary to\nappreciate our current lack of knowledge about imprinted gene\nfunction in the brain. The evidence that imprinted gene function\nmay be disrupted in autism and psychosis is largely circumstantial,\nmainly coming from parent-of-origin dependent linkage\/associ-\nation effects or from studies of subjects with cytogenetic abnorm-\nalities in imprinted gene-rich regions. In the former case,\ncandidate genes have often not been identified, or when they\nhave been identified, the molecular basis of the parent-of-origin\nassociation effect has not been clarified. Work which includes\ngenetic, epigenetic, functional, and association approaches (such\nas that by Francks et al. 2007) is likely to improve our knowledge\nof imprinted gene dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorder, and\nwill permit us to propose more refined hypotheses. In the latter\ncase, the cytogenetic abnormalities often encompass multiple\noppositely imprinted genes, together with non-imprinted bystan-\nders, making drawing conclusions as to the functions of individual\nimprinted genes complicated.\nA number of independent studies have now shown that disrup-\ntions of the imprinted gene-rich cluster on human chromosome\n15q11-q13 result in mental disorder, including both autism and\npsychosis. Evidence for this comes from a number of general\ngenomic association studies (Martin & Ledbetter 2007), and also\nfrom the explicit imprinted gene syndromes, Angelman syndrome\n(AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which display aspects of\nautistic-like behaviour and psychosis, respectively. Indeed, it is\nthe reciprocity of the neuropsychiatric problems observed in AS\nand PWS that forms the cornerstone of C&B\u2019s theory, as these dis-\norders are caused by the absence of maternal gene expression, and\npaternal gene expression at 15q11-q13, respectively. One import-\nant consideration, however, is that the original suggestion of such\nreciprocity (Boer et al. 2002) also identified that it is an overdosage\nof maternal gene expression found specifically in maternal unipar-\nental disomy and imprinting centre defect sub-types of PWS that\npredisposes to psychosis. This finding does not contradict C&B\u2019s\ntheory, but it does point to the fact that it is not the lack of paternal\ngene expression from this cluster per se which results in psychosis.\nHowever, these waters are further muddied by the fact that one of\nthe most consistently observed cytogenetic abnormalities in autis-\ntic subjects is duplication of the maternally inherited chromosomal\nregion 15q11-q13 (Martin & Ledbetter 2007); this implies that\noverdosage of maternally expressed imprinted genes in this\nregion may predispose to autistic tendencies. This observation is\ninconsistent with the simple idea that over-expression of maternal\ngenes in this region leads to psychosis, but nevertheless may help\nto explain why a significant proportion of PWS subjects\ndemonstrate symptoms reminiscent of autism spectrum disorders\n(Dimitropoulos & Schultz 2007). Thus, the findings from perhaps\nthe best characterised imprinted disorders only partially support\nC&B\u2019s prediction, in that while the genes in the imprinted\ncluster on 15q11-q13 are almost certainly involved in social func-\ntioning, the functional dissociations between paternally and mater-\nnally expressed genes in this region are still unclear.\nOn a technical note, C&B state that imprinted genes can be\ndysregulated in more ways than non-imprinted genes; this is\nincorrect. However, the monoallelic expression of imprinted\ngenes does render them more vulnerable to complete inacti-\nvation. Moreover, given that imprinted genes are important\nplayers in fundamental neurodevelopmental processes (Wilkin-\nson et al. 2007), it is likely that the consequences of their dysre-\ngulation may be profound. Finally, the complexities of genomic\nimprinting have necessitated the use of a standardised termino-\nlogy. For example, it is now common practice to describe\nimprinted genes on the basis of their expressed allele (i.e., pater-\nnally or maternally expressed genes) rather than their silenced\nallele. As such, ambiguous terms like \u201cpaternal-gene bias\u201d need\nto be clarified to prevent confusion.\nIn summary, we believe that the ideas presented in the review\narticle are highly original and should be considered when inter-\npreting genetic data from neuropsychiatric conditions.\nHowever, the caveats mentioned herein should be borne in\nmind upon such interpretation.\nHeterogeneity and hypothesis testing in\nneuropsychiatric illness\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004275\nCurtis K.

We suggest an approach in which heterogeneity may be put\nto use in hypothesis testing, and may find application in evaluation of\nthe Crespi & Badcock (C&B) imprinting hypothesis. Here we consider\nthree potential sources of etiologic subtypes for analysis.\nComing to grips with the problem of heterogeneity has been a\nlong-standing challenge to neuropsychiatric research. Etiologic\nand phenotypic forms of heterogeneity have the potential to sap\nexperimental designs of their statistical power to detect group\ndifferences among diagnostic and control groups, and to frustrate\nattempts to identify genes associated with neuropsychiatric diag-\nnostic status (Fanous & Kendler 2005; McClellan et al. 2007).\nHeterogeneity and its consequences hold broad implications\nfor hypothesis testing in the field, including theses put forward\nby Crespi & Badcock (C&B) regarding genomic imprinting.\nThe authors acknowledge that their topics of study \u2013 autistic-\nand psychotic-spectrum disorders \u2013 have multiple causes that\nare not necessarily related to imprinting. Nonetheless, they\nposit a lawful tendency for imprinted genes with maternal\nexpression to underlie the psychosis spectrum, whereas pater-\nnally expressed genes contribute to the autism spectrum. Will\nthese effects of imprinting cohere in the face of heterogeneity?\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n266 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nTypically, discussions of heterogeneity in neuropsychiatry stra-\ntegize to surmount obstacles to discovery. In contrast, our com-\nmentary discusses a way that one might turn etiologic\nheterogeneity to an advantage: for example, finding application\nin testing the C&B imprinting hypothesis. We limit our com-\nments to this aspect of the target article, and our examples\nderive primarily from autism research.\nA rigorous test of C&B\u2019s hypothesis requires multiple\ninstances of imprinting in order to evaluate whether parent-of-\norigin effects are statistically associated with diagnosis. In the\nabsence of statistical inference, the imprinting hypothesis is\nspeculative and narrowly based. However, combining across a\ncollection of these instances \u2013 utilizing an etiologically hetero-\ngeneous assortment conditions associated with a diagnostic spec-\ntrum \u2013 one could determine whether predicted imprinting\neffects indeed assort with diagnosis. How readily can multiple\ninstances of conditions be attained? We outline three approaches\nin the following paragraphs.\nFirst, it seems reasonable that known genes for a disorder\nmight provide a test of this hypothesis. However, our current\nstage of knowledge is limited. Except for syndromic forms in\nwhich mutations in a single gene have been specified, no genes\nhave been unambiguously associated with autism (Sebat et al.\n2007). Perhaps with the advent of large-scale whole-genome\nassociation studies (Ropers 2007), solid findings of single genes\nmay appear for autism and psychosis. Also, the power to detect\nthese genes may be increased by the use of strategies such as stra-\ntification on phenotypic subtypes and incorporation of broader\nphenotypes (Geschwind & Levitt 2007; Matthysse et al. 1992;\nMcCaffery & Deutsch 2005; Spence et al. 2006). Once reliable\nsingle-gene effects are documented, the imprinted subset\nwould be relevant vis-a`-vis the authors\u2019 hypothesis.\nSecond, until these single genes might be found, potentially\ninformative tests may be derived from identified genetic syn-\ndromes associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes. This\napproach to testing the imprinting hypothesis was adopted by\nC&B. Take, for example, the contrast of Prader-Willi and Angel-\nman syndromes \u2013 two imprinted forms of a genetic disorder\n(deletion of 15q11-q13; Christian et al. 1999). The authors\nadduced a pattern in which autistic symptomatology in Angelman\nsyndrome, as opposed to psychotic features in Prader-Willi syn-\ndrome, is associated respectively with dysregulation of imprinted\ngenes towards paternal and maternal origin.\nThis experimental strategy lends itself to a test of the imprint-\ning hypothesis. Many genetic syndromes display autistic and\/or\npsychotic symptomatology. Are there enough to test the imprint-\ning hypothesis at hand? To address this question, first one might\nask whether these syndromes yield bona fide cases of neuropsy-\nchiatric illness that meet standard diagnostic criteria. We have\nfound that conditions associated with autism reveal many syn-\ndromes that do meet the \u201cgold standard\u201d of the Autism Diagnos-\ntic Inventory (revised, ADI-R; Lord et al. 2001), among them:\nAngelman (Peters et al. 2004), velocardiofacial\/diGeorge (del-\netion of 22q11; Fine et al. 2005), fragile X (Clifford et al.\n2007), and Smith-Lemli-Opitz (Tierney et al. 2001), as well as\nCowden disease (PTEN mutation; Butler et al. 2005), Mobius\nsequence (Johansson et al. 2001), neurofibromatosis (Havolvi-\ncova et al. 2007), and tuberous sclerosis (Smalley 1998). A test\nof the C&B hypothesis would also require a priori identification\nof imprinting for a genetic marker.\nThird, a newly emerging class of genetic markers may prove\nuseful in testing the association of parent-of-origin effects with\nneuropsychiatric illness. These are alterations in DNA copy\nnumber (copy number variants, or CNVs; Iafrate et al. 2004;\nSebat et al. 2004), and they are assayed at a level of resolution\nhigher than conventional cytogenetic methods that have been\nused to identify karyotypic abnormalities in autism (Wassink\net al. 2004). Recently, germline mutations have been found to\nbe remarkably prevalent among individuals with autistic-spec-\ntrum disorders (Sebat et al. 2007). The genomic regions of\nthese CNVs correlated with autism were highly heterogeneous\nand included de novo mutations of single genes. In general, vari-\nations may be de novo or familial \u2013 for example, in which the\nproband and one parent share the CNV.\nThe array-based technology to detect these CNVs is now pro-\nviding yet more resolute assays, and even more CNVs are\nexpected to be identified. Some of these may overlap, deriving\nfrom genomic regions that are particularly vulnerable (Perry\net al. 2006). Sebat et al. (2007) have already found variants ident-\nified by other investigators. Potentially, variants may emerge for\nautism and psychosis that are tractable to imprinting studies. This\nsubset could be studied in association with neuropsychiatric phe-\nnotypes, yielding a quantitative test of assortment.\nWe have suggested an instance in which heterogeneous\ngenetic markers could be useful in hypothesis testing. Hetero-\ngeneity may have other lessons to teach us, as well. How could\na miscellany of etiologic factors converge on a common beha-\nvioral phenotype? The answer has proven elusive, although\nthere are empirically based models that address the phenom-\nenon. For autism, there have been explanations tied to neuronal\nconnectivity (Just et al. 2004; Rippon et al. 2007), disordered\nneural excitation or inhibition (Rubenstein & Merzenich 2003),\naberrant connections of neural networks (Geschwind & Levitt\n2007), and neurodevelopmentally altered temporal binding\n(Brock et al. 2002; Deutsch 1998; Rippon et al. 2007). Under-\nstanding how a heterogeneous collection of causal factors\nemerges as a single diagnostic entity is key in delineating the\nbiology of neuropsychiatric illness.\nIs this conjectural phenotypic dichotomy a\nplausible outcome of genomic imprinting?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004287\nBenjamin James Alexander Dickins,a David William Dickins,b\nand Thomas Edmund Dickinsc\na505Wartik Laboratory, Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics,\nThe Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802; bSchool of\nPsychology, University of Liverpool, ERB, Liverpool L69 7ZA, United Kingdom;\ncSchool of Psychology, University of East London, London E15 4LZ, United\nKingdom, and Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, The\nLondon School of Economics, London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom.\nben@bx.psu.edu\nhttp:\/\/www.bendickins.net\/\ndickins@liverpool.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.liv.ac.uk\/psychology\/staff\/ddickins.html\nt.dickins@uel.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.uel.ac.uk\/psychology\/staff\/tomdickins.htm\nAbstract: What is the status of the dichotomy proposed and the\nnosological validity of the contrasting pathologies described in the\ntarget article? How plausibly can dysregulated imprinting explain\nthe array of features described, compared with other genetic models?\nWe believe that considering alternative models is more likely to lead in\nthe long term to the correct classification and explanation of the\ncomponent behaviours.\nAt the conceptual core of Crespi & Badcock\u2019s (C&B\u2019s) case are\ntwo developmental syndromes in humans attributed to imprinted\ngenes on chromosome 15q11\u201313: Angelman syndrome (AS),\ncaused by mutations abolishing expression of the maternally tran-\nscribed UBE3A gene (Lalande & Calciano 2007), and Prader-\nWilli syndrome (PWS), caused by deficits in expression of\npaternal genes in the same imprinting cluster (Bittel & Butler\n2005). Given this, and the dominance of the conflict theory for\nthe evolution of imprinting (Haig & Westoby 1989; Moore &\nHaig 1991), the effects of intragenomic conflict have been\ninferred from several phenotypes manifested in these conditions\n(Brown & Consedine 2004; Haig & Wharton 2003). The genetic\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 267\ncauses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are\nmore complex than those of AS and PWS, and manifestly poly-\ngenic in nature. This should make one cautious of the authors\u2019\nproposal, though not dismissive.\nBecause of their complex epigenetic regulation, imprinted\ngenes are vulnerable to dysregulation (target article, sect. 3),\nthough they are not unique in this respect (e.g., maternal beha-\nviour regulates promoter methylation of the glucocorticoid\nreceptor gene in rat pups; Weaver et al. 2004). However, many\nimprinted genes are expressed in the mammalian brain (Davies\net al. 2005), thereby presenting a large mutational target and\nincreasing the prior probability of imprinted gene involvement\nin ASD and schizophrenia. Classic work with mouse embryos chi-\nmeric for wildtype and androgenetic (Ag) or parthenogenetic\n(Pg) cells (Allen et al. 1995; Keverne et al. 1996) also suggests\na role for imprinting in brain development, but some evidence\npresented by C&B seems contrary to neuroanatomical predic-\ntions one might derive from this work. For example, increased\nand decreased hippocampal size in autism and schizophrenia\n(target article, sect. 6.1.2) is not consistent with Pg cell accumu-\nlation in the hippocampus (Allen et al. 1995), and overall brain\nsize is decreased in chimeras with a high contribution of Ag\ncells (Keverne et al. 1996), contrary to brain size increases in\nautism (sect. 6.1.1).\nThese concerns aside, C&B\u2019s theory is impressive in terms of the\nwealth of phenomena it endeavours to embrace, and several fea-\ntures described in Table 1 are plausibly supportive. Even here,\nthough, the authors\u2019 exclusive reliance on the conflict theory may\nbe misleading. For example, in utero growth restriction is associ-\nated with paternal over-expression in transient neonatal diabetes\n(Temple & Shield 2002), against the predictions of this and some\nother theories for the evolution of imprinting. Comparisons with\nexisting theories or data are post hoc, and C&B know they need\nto propose falsifiable hypotheses. While they make some interest-\ning predictions, we do not believe their model sufficiently specifies\nhow imprinted genes are involved and in what phenotypes.\nThe behavioural phenotypes of ASD and schizophrenia are\ncomplex. In ASD the trio of \u201cimpaired social interaction,\nimpaired communication and restricted and repetitive interests\nand activities\u201d are linked conceptually by jointly providing the\ninclusive definition of ASD rather than biologically by any\nstrong associations in their occurrence in psychological tests of\nthe general population (Happe\u00b4 et al. 2006) or in genetic twin\nstudies (Ronald et al. 2006). Therefore, comparative studies\nbetween groups of ASD versus other individuals could produce\nartefactual associations between the separate components of\nthis triad (Happe\u00b4 et al. 2006). The same is likely to be true a for-\ntiori for any umbrella concept of schizophrenia (Bentall 2003),\nlet alone for an opposing cluster of psychoticism which also\nincludes bipolar disorder and major depression.\nThese considerations raise the question, \u201cWhat constitutes a\ncontinuum in biology?\u201d Is a nominal scale sufficient? We see\nthis conspectus of phenotypic features as more idiographic\nthan nomothetic. But even on a nominal scale there is the\nproblem of co-morbidity. The authors cite evidence for co-mor-\nbidity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-\ndeficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with both autism and\nschizophrenia. From this they predict the existence of different\ntypes of OCD and ADHD in autism and schizophrenia. But\nwhy do they not consider co-morbidity a major problem for\ntheir position? Are there any kinds of co-morbidity that would\nconstitute a disconfirmation of the hypothesis?\nInsofar as C&B\u2019s thesis depends on conflict theory, we note the\nneed for hypotheses to be developed regarding differential manipu-\nlation of parents in autism and schizophrenia. We remain to be per-\nsuaded that the mechanizing\/mentalizing dichotomy will map onto\nmore manipulation in autism and less in schizophrenia. It seems\nreasonable to suppose the existence of Machiavellian manipulators\nof maternal care possessed of good mentalizing abilities. We must\nwait for data to be collected to settle this question.\nMore generally, although we believe that conflict theory has\nconsiderable explanatory utility, an alternative model of imprinting\nevolution under sexually antagonistic selection might help C&B\nelucidate the links between parental gene effects and sexual differ-\nences (sect. 7). For example, a gene may tend to show expression\nlimited to the paternal allele when alleles of that gene benefit\nmales more than they cost females (Day & Bonduriansky 2004).\nSuch a mechanism could provide a specific explanation for why\nautism appears simultaneously to be caused by an excess of\npaternal gene expression and manifests as an \u201cextreme male\nbrain\u201d phenotype. In this context the authors\u2019 observations about\nthe relations between sex and severity in autism and schizophrenia\n(e.g., their Fig. 6) seem to hint at such a selective regime.\nFinally we emphasize the importance of considering alterna-\ntive genetic models that explain the prevalence of ASD and\nschizophrenia or their components. We will mention just one\nhere. Some alleles (of one or more genes) may show benefits\nwhen inherited alone, but cause mental dysfunction when inheri-\nted together such that selection maintains them in the population\nin a balanced polymorphism. For instance, Nettle and Clegg\n(2006) have noted that schizotypy is strongly related to creativity,\nwhich in turn has been linked to reproductive success (Miller\n2001), at least in terms of number of sexual partners over a life-\ntime. They confirmed this by showing that two out of four com-\nponent dimensions of schizotypy were positively correlated with\nmating success in a large sample of British adults that included\namateur and professional artists and poets.\nCreativity, psychosis, autism, and\nthe social brain\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004299\nMichael Fitzgerald and Ziarih Hawi\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.\nfitzi@iol.ie\nhttp:\/\/www.medicine.tcd.ie\/psychiatry\/\nzhhawi@tcd.ie\nhttp:\/\/www.medicine.tcd.ie\/psychiatry\/research\/neuropsychiatry\/\nAbstract: In the target article, Crespi & Badcock (C&B) propose a novel\nhypothesis based on observations that a large set of phenotypic traits\nexhibit diametrically opposite phenotypes in autism-spectrum versus\npsychotic-spectrum conditions. They propose that development of\nthese conditions is mediated in part by alterations in \u201cgenomic\nimprinting.\u201d This hypothesis is based on the model of the Prader-Willi\nand Angelman syndromes. The authors have produced a masterful\ndiscussion of the differences between psychosis and autism. Of course,\nanother article could be written on the similarities.\nClinically, the target article of Crespi & Badcock (C&B) does\nhave a ring of truth. However, their hypothesis \u2013 that the\ndevelopment of autistic- and psychotic-spectrum conditions is\nmediated in part by alterations in \u201cgenomic imprinting\u201d \u2013 does\nnot explain or accommodate some potent molecular\nand genetic considerations. There are two main points to\nconsider:\n1. Both of the conditions (autism and psychosis) are highly\nheterogeneous (as C&B point out), involving many complex\ntraits. It is unlikely that all these traits are the result of disruption\nto either maternal or paternal gene imprinting processes, as the\nnumber of the imprinted genes is very small and does not\naccount for more than 1% of the genome at the best estimate.\nFurther, if the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes form the\ncentral dogma of the hypothesis, then how does a disruption of\nthe imprinting process in the same set of genes result in two con-\nditions with divergent age of onsets \u2013 early in the case of autism\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n268 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nand at adolescence or around the mid-twenties in the case of\npsychosis?\n2. As yet there is no solid molecular evidence (linkage or\nassociation) to implicate imprinting or disruption of an imprint-\ning process in either autism or psychosis. If, however, identified\nin the future, they may have a minor contribution to the whole\nprocess of developing the above conditions, as both are polygenic\ndisorders with several genes (each of minor effect) contributing\nto their development.\nC&B\u2019s key table (Table 1) is very persuasive in showing the\ndifferences between autism and psychosis, and this forms the\ncentral hypothesis of the article. However, it is frequently\nreported in the literature that features of neurodevelopmental\ndisorders are non-specific, and that overlaps in the nosology of\nneurodevelopmental disorders exist. This is frequently reported\nin relation to autism and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD) with attentional difficulties commonly occurring in\nautism. One of the authors of this commentary (Fitzgerald)\nhas observed an overlap between elective mutism and autism-\nspectrum disorders as suggested in Figure 1 of the target\narticle. Further, individuals with high functioning autism may\nshow fixed and rigid beliefs reminiscent of delusions observed\nin psychosis. Moreover, creativity is frequently observed in the\ncontext of psychosis, particularly in bipolar illness. Although\ncreativity in schizophrenia diminishes after the onset of the con-\ndition, family members with less severe traits of the condition can\nshow great creativity, reflecting perhaps broader phenotype fea-\ntures. Asperger\u2019s syndrome is also associated with creativity; and\nalthough great creativity in old age is uncommon, the lack of\ndecrease of gray matter volume with aging (McAlonan et al.\n2002) in persons with Asperger\u2019s syndrome may explain the old\nage creativity sometimes seen with persons with Asperger\u2019s\nsyndrome. There are small subgroups of persons with autism-\nspectrum disorders who are fearless. This group has been given\ninsufficient attention in the target article. In addition, all novel\nstimuli are not avoided in autism, as there is an autistic type of\nnovelty seeking which is partly responsible for their great\ncreativity.\nFinally, at times, it appears that the separation between autism\nand schizophrenia is too neat in C&B\u2019s article.\nPrivate speech, cognitive-computational\ncontrol, and the autism-psychosis continuum\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004305\nWilliam Frawley\nCenter for Applied Linguistics, Washington, DC 20016.\nbfrawley@cal.org\nAbstract: Autism and psychosis manifest private speech disruptions\nanalogous to their diametrical opposition along the autism-psychosis\ncontinuum. Autism has naturally suppressed private speech with\npredictable structural deficits when it does surface; psychosis has overt\nbut ineffectual private speech with similar structural deficits. These\nprivate speech oppositions are best understood in the context of the\ncontrol processes of cognitive-computational architectures.\nCrespi & Badcock\u2019s (C&B\u2019s) autism-psychosis opposition has\nanalogous diametrical differences in the syndromes\u2019 self-moni-\ntoring and inner private speech. In autism, self-talk for cognitive\nregulation is absent or reduced, but in psychosis, it is overt, yet\nineffectual. These differences gain detail and explanatory\npower if understood in the context of cognitive-computational\ncontrol.\nProcessing architectures distinguish logic (representations per\nse) from control (management of dataflow) (Frawley 1997;\nKowalski 2005a; 2005b; Pylyshyn 1985). Control is clearly seen\nin cross-domain thinking, either across whole knowledge\ndomains (Carruthers 2002, Frawley 2002b; e.g., coordination of\nvisual and motor representations) or across levels within\ndomains (Frawley 2002a; e.g., at the phonology-syntax interface\nin language). Inner speech is an instrument of the former and\nsurfaces as private speech to facilitate and regulate cognition\nand behavior during complex, online thinking. The structure and\neffectiveness of private speech correlate with task challenge\nand performance (though, see Fernyhough & Fradley 2005).\nThe issue for the autism-psychosis account is exactly how these\nsyndromes and their regulatory disruptions add to the control\nmix. Self-regulatory talk exhibits two major control failures:\n1. Failure to surface at all \u2013 or to do so in reduced form. This\nis a potentially very serious disorder of cognitive control because\nthe lack of self-talk prevents external speech-scaffolding for\nonline thinking.\n2. Surfacing with deficits in structure and so functionally inef-\nfective. Such private speech cannot perform appropriate regulat-\nory functions and hence will run parallel to behavior instead of\nguiding it; it cannot be developmentally internalized (or \u201cgo\nunderground,\u201d as Vygotsky said); nor can it dynamically manifest\nitself and re-surface appropriately when it is needed for cognitive\nand behavioral regulation.\nC&B cite research to the effect that in autism, inner speech is\nabsent or reduced. But under my reading, the autistic individuals\nin question did indeed have inner speech, but less private speech.\nWithout inner speech, individuals would lack an internal\nlanguage for cross-domain thinking, and it is not clear that\nanyone lacks that, whatever the severity of the disorder. Evidence\nfor the existence of inner, but not private, speech in autism can\nbe seen in the results of Williams et al. (2008), who have found\nthat, on a direct phonological encoding task, individuals with\nautism-spectrum disorder deployed inner speech as much as\nindividuals of comparable mental age without autism.\nBut reduced private speech is another story. Whitehouse\net al. (2006) have found that autistic individuals have truncated\narticulations in overt labeling tasks. But more curiously, articu-\nlatory suppression did not affect autistic individuals\u2019 perform-\nance in task-switching scenarios (a difficult cognitive\nrequirement), yet it did affect the performance of normal con-\ntrols. Why?\nNormal individuals alternate implicit and explicit self-speech\nto scaffold behavior under duress. Autistic individuals have\ninner speech, but are unable to use it overtly in self-guiding\ntasks. With its repetitive and self-directed behaviors, autism\nmight be expected to encourage private speech. But as a disorder\nof overactive input filters, autistics use these behaviors to block\ninput, which readily reaches excessive intake in autism. Private\nspeech does not function to block input. So while normal individ-\nuals naturally allow inner speech to surface as private speech\nbecause they have no blocking problem, autistic individuals natu-\nrally suppress it. Additional support for this argument can be\nfound in C&B\u2019s observation that neurological studies of autistics\nreveal abnormal lack of deactivation of default executive func-\ntions when attention is redirected: This suggests that persistence\nof internal executive control is the normal state for the autistic\nend of the spectrum when it should otherwise deactivate to\nrefocus attention on new input. Put simply, in autistics, inner\nspeech stays inner. A task which enhances private speech sup-\npression should therefore have no effect on the performance of\nautistic subjects, as was found, because suppression ratifies the\ndefault state of autistic inner speech. It would be surprising if\nsuppression of speech did have an effect on autistic individuals\nand surprising if it did not for controls.\nThese findings may in fact relate closely to the severity of\nthe disorder. Low-functioning autistics should have unex-\npressed inner speech, but high-functioning autistics \u2013 those\nwho fall along the cline toward \u201cnormal,\u201d from Asperger\u2019s syn-\ndrome to Angelman\u2019s syndrome to pervasive developmental\ndisorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) \u2013 ought to\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 269\nhave private speech, but it should be functionally defective.\nI know of no study of this predicted difference, but my informal\nobservations of high-functioning autistics, including my own son,\nbear this out. PDD-NOS individuals\u2019 private speech has deficits\nin metapragmatics and discourse markers, the very features that\nindex cross-domain control because they encode the line\nbetween linguistic and nonlinguistic knowledge. Problems with\nthese structural elements are typical in ineffective private\nspeech, whatever its cause (Frawley 1997).\nThus, as autistic severity lessens and the autistic spectrum\napproaches normal, private speech should also surface in difficult\ntasks but be functionally ineffective and have predictable struc-\ntural deficits. Systematic study of this prediction remains to be\ndone. But the larger point is that the autism spectrum has an ana-\nlogous private speech spectrum, and the effectuality of private\nspeech might be a new measure of the severity of the autism.\nIn contrast, psychosis has diametrically opposite private\nspeech manifestations, though with similar functional results.\nC&B do not illustrate psychotic private speech, but it is well\nknown that such speech is elaborate and ostensibly social, yet\nregulatorily ineffective. Jones and Fernyhough (2007) observe\nthat verbal self-mediation in psychosis manifests problems in dis-\ntinguishing self from other and often takes the form of com-\nmands. Psychotic individuals hear their own private speech as\norders from others.\nAs with autistic private speech, problems in psychotic private\nspeech evidence deficits in metapragmatics and discourse\nforms. Normal private speech metapragmatically signals that\nthe speech is self-derived, as can be seen in the prevalence of\nself-directed questions (\u201cNow what did I do wrong?\u201d). Moreover,\nthe illocutionary force of normal private speech utterances can be\nother than a command (directive). Self-directed \u201cBlue, blue\u201d in a\ntask could mean \u201cThere\u2019s the blue one\u201d (presentative), \u201cI need a\nblue one\u201d (desiderative), and so forth.\nPrivate speech in individuals with psychosis is overt to match\ntheir over-social cognition, but relatively undifferentiated in the\nway the speech encodes and executes control. As a consequence,\nthis speech for thinking cannot \u201cgo underground\u201d to serve inner\nfunctions. Just as speech for thinking in severe autism keeps the\nmind inside itself, so the same speech for thinking in severe psy-\nchosis keeps the mind away from itself. A detailed linguistic\nanalysis of the private speech in psychotic syndromes would\nlikely show deficits in the same metapragmatic and discourse\nmarkers as in autism, but with different functional effects.\nA similar diagnostic cline to \u201cnormal\u201d should also present itself,\nwith movement from severe to less severe, as measured by\nprivate speech and signaled by the gradual reduction and intern-\nalization of private speech and concomitant increase of functional\ncognitive control.\nAutism and psychosis are diametric control syndromes \u2013 true\nprivate speech opposites. Each moves toward normal by the\nother\u2019s failures \u2013 autism via increased explicitness and psychosis\nvia increased implicitness.\nImprinting and psychiatric genetics: Beware\nthe diagnostic phenotype\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004317\nLisa M. Goos\nPsychiatry Research, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, M5G\n1X8, Canada.\nlisa.goos@sickkids.ca\nAbstract: Studies of the role of imprinted genes in psychological\nphenomena are long overdue. The target article is comprehensive,\npresenting a wealth of important and convergent evidence, and\nprovides an excellent point of departure for further research. However,\nthe authors\u2019 evidentiary grasp exceeds the explicatory capacity of the\nproposed model. Greater genotypic and phenotypic precision would\nsignificantly enhance its predictive power.\nImprinted genes expressed in the brain are numerous, and they\nplay important roles in nervous system development (Keverne\net al. 1996). Elucidating their influence on psychological function\nwill require greater understanding of epigenetic processes among\nscientists trained to study behavioural phenomena. For this\nreason, the comprehensive work presented in Crespi & Bad-\ncock\u2019s (C&B\u2019s) article is an important one. The article is exhaus-\ntively researched and provides direction for further investigation.\nUnfortunately, the authors try to explain too much with too little,\noutstripping the explanatory capability of the model. A wide\nvariety of psychiatric diagnoses are included in the target\narticle, and their dichotomous categorization seems forced at\ntimes. Furthermore, the core \u201cbalanced see-saw\u201d model pre-\nsented is insufficiently precise.\nPhenotypes in psychiatric research. The target article\nattempts to integrate a variety of psychological and psychiatric\nphenomena, many of which have not previously been conceptu-\nalized as related. Phenotypic commonalities can be beneficial\nguides in the search for etiological factors, particularly in the\ncase of complex psychiatric disorders. However, the most nar-\nrowly defined traits are likely to be of greatest utility. The\nbroad phenotypes used in target article, alternating between\nsymptoms such as psychosis or depression and diagnostic cat-\negories such as autism, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD), are problematic in this regard.\nThe power to identify relevant genetic factors is directly influ-\nenced by the \u201cpurity\u201d of the relationship between the trait under\nstudy and the underlying genes. Failure to identify appropriate\nphenotypes for genetic study is exacerbated in the field of psy-\nchiatric genetics where diagnostic classification is often used as\nthe phenotype of interest (Feinstein & Singh 2007). This is a\nvery serious mistake, as heterogeneity is rampant within diagnos-\ntic categories, and individuals with the same diagnosis may vary\nsignificantly in phenotype and etiology, even in the presence of\nhigh heritability.\nEndophenotypes are traits that function as indices of under-\nlying genetic liability to disorder: they are phenotypic manifes-\ntations intermediate to the genes and the overt clinical\nsyndrome (Gottesman & Gould 2003). Consequently, they are\nmore likely to be associated with specific susceptibility genes,\nand may show higher heritability than the complex clinical end-\npoints that are the usual focus of psychiatric research.\nThe use of endophenotypes in the study of complex psychiatric\ndisorders is increasing, and has been shown to facilitate the\nidentification of genetic risk factors (Castellanos & Tannock\n2002; Kruglyak & Lander 1995). This approach has advanced\nthe study of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;\nCrosbie et al. 2008; Schachar et al. 2005); and evidence that\ndifferent symptoms in autism are independently influenced by\ndifferent genes (Ronald et al. 2006; Shao et al. 2003) suggests\nthe same may be true for this complex disorder. To investigate\npotential imprinting effects, grouping on the basis of behavioural\nor psychiatric commonalities with known imprinted disorders\n(such as Prader-Willi syndrome [PWS]), and the study of\nparent-of-origin effects, are also effective ways to proceed\n(Goos et al. 2007; Goos & Ragsdale 2008).\nImprinted genes and social cognition. The authors\u2019 imprinted\nbrain model of autism is based on the enhanced influence of\npaternal genes relative to maternal. The \u201cspectrum\u201d of psychosis\nis presently suggested as the outcome of increased relative influ-\nence of maternal genes over paternal. C&B posit no significant\nphenotypic divergence based on the genetic cause of the relative\nover-expression (i.e., duplication vs. deletion).\nThis view is consistent with evidence of functional comple-\nmentarity in a number of imprinted genes, such as insulin-like\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n270 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\ngrowth factor 2 and its receptor, which form a tightly linked phys-\niological unit (Haig & Graham 1991). In this case, deletion or\nduplication of either gene produces predictable outcomes of\nover- or undergrowth. This logic is unlikely to apply, however,\nin the case of highly variable behavioural phenomena.\nThe evolutionary forces driving imprinting (Haig & Westoby\n1989) are compounded and exacerbated by those due to sociality\n(Haig 2000a). In primates, social skills directly influence both\nsurvival and reproductive success (Silk 2007). Furthermore,\nprimate social interactions occur primarily with maternal kin\n(Cheney et al. 1986). In this context, the adaptive resolution of\nconflict over resource transfer, for maternal and paternal\ngenes, would involve social skills, in order to maximize resource\nacquisition, minimize individual risk due to conflict, and restrain\ndirect and indirect maternal fitness costs.\nUniparental cell deposition patterns in chimeric mice\nsupport this conjecture. Maternally expressed genes contribute\nprimarily to the development of cortical areas mediating\ncomplex socio-cognitive skills, such as memory, planning, and\nlanguage (Allen et al. 1995). The paternal contribution is\nprimary in the mediobasal forebrain and hypothalamus\n(Keverne et al. 1996). These areas are crucial for adaptive soci-\nality, largely mediated via oxytocin and vasopressin. These hor-\nmones reduce social fear, anxiety, and aggression; moderate\nstress reactivity; facilitate social memory and behavioural flexi-\nbility; and coordinate behavioural and emotional responses to\nsocial stimuli (Carter & Altemus 1997; Kirsch et al. 2005;\nWinslow & Insel 2004).\nIf both maternal and paternal genes were selected to maxi-\nmize fitness in a social milieu, it is likely that imbalance in\neither direction would result in social deficits. Moreover, differ-\nent suites of social impairments may legitimately attract the\nsame diagnosis of autism. Relative paternal over-expression\ndue to mutation(s) in maternally expressed genes could\nproduce the cognitive and language deficits characteristic of\nautism, as suggested by C&B. However, relative maternal\nover-expression due to mutation(s) in paternally expressed\ngenes could lead to deficits in socio-emotional processing,\nsuch as heightened reactivity, anxiety and fear, and stereotypy\nand rigidity, also characteristic of autism (Corbett et al. 2006;\nHollander et al. 2003; Jansen et al. 2003). Indeed, this postula-\ntion is consistent with evidence in the literature documenting\ncortical or neuroendocrine dysfunction in autism, but not\nnecessarily both (Belmonte & Carper 2006; Chandana et al.\n2005; Green et al. 2001; Jacob et al. 2007; Modahl et al. 1998;\nWu et al. 2005).\nThe target article represents an important step in the integration\nof genomic imprinting and the study of psychopathology. It would,\nhowever, be much more compelling and influential if it were more\nfinely parsed with respect to the imprinted genotypes included in\nit, as well as the behavioural phenotypes it seeks to explain.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nDr. Goos is supported by a CIHR Postdoctoral Fellowship from the\nOntario Women\u2019s Health Council.

Therefore, variant alleles at imprinted loci are promising\ncandidates for playing a causal role in disorders of social behavior. The\neffects of imprinted genes evolved in the context of patterns of\nasymmetric relatedness that existed within social groups of our ancestors.\nGenomic imprinting is an expression of an evolutionary conflict,\nwithin the genomes of individual organisms, between genes of\nmaternal and paternal origin. It evolves when a genetically deter-\nmined action enhances the inclusive fitness of madumnal (mater-\nnally derived) genes but reduces the inclusive fitness of\npadumnal (paternally derived) genes, or vice versa. Such situ-\nations arise when the expression of a gene in one individual\n(the actor) has fitness consequences for other individuals who\nare asymmetric kin of the actor (Haig 1997). (Asymmetric kin\nare individuals with different probabilities of carrying copies\n[identical by recent descent] of an actor\u2019s madumnal and padum-\nnal alleles. For example, maternal half-sibs are asymmetric kin,\nrelated through the actor\u2019s mother but not the actor\u2019s father,\nwhereas full-sibs are symmetric kin, equally related to the actor\nvia a shared mother and shared father.)\nOffspring are usually symmetric kin of parents (a parent\u2019s\nmaternal and paternal alleles each has a 50% chance of being\ntransmitted to offspring) but parents are asymmetric kin of off-\nspring (an offspring\u2019s maternal alleles are present in its mother,\nbut the offspring\u2019s paternal alleles are absent from its mother).\nTherefore, an offspring\u2019s interactions with its parents are pre-\ndicted to be more internally conflicted than are the parents\u2019 inter-\nactions with the offspring. If one assumes that interactions with\nmothers have been more salient than interactions with fathers,\nthen paternally expressed genes should promote behaviors that\nengage maternal attention and elicit maternal care, whereas\nmaternally expressed genes should favor greater independence\nof the child. This is the principal source of asymmetric kinship\nconsidered by Crespi & Badcock (C&B).\nAlthough an offspring usually has an equal chance of inheriting\nthe madumnal or the padumnal allele at a locus in one of its\nparents, this symmetry breaks down under inbreeding (Wilkins\n& Haig 2003). Offspring are asymmetric kin of their mother if\ntheir father is asymmetric kin of the mother (and vice versa).\nFor example, a child conceived by father-daughter incest is not\nonly its mother\u2019s offspring but also her paternal half-sib. Simi-\nlarly, the child of a woman who marries her father\u2019s sister\u2019s son\nis simultaneously its mother\u2019s offspring and her patrilateral first\ncousin once-removed. In both cases, the child would be more\nlikely to carry copies of its mother\u2019s padumnal alleles than\ncopies of her madumnal alleles. In general, a woman\u2019s madumnal\nalleles are predicted to favor greater aversion for sexual relations\nwith patrilineal kin (Haig 1999a).\nSibling rivalry has probably been intensified in recent human\nevolution because we have shorter interbirth intervals than our\nclosest relatives but longer periods of juvenile dependence\n(Kennedy 2005). Therefore, sibs will often have competed for\nresources provided by adults. Full-sibs are symmetric kin,\nwhereas half-sibs are asymmetric kin. The key question for\nunderstanding the role of imprinting in sibling rivalry is the rela-\ntive importance of competition with paternal half-sibs (patrisibs)\nand maternal half-sibs (matrisibs). If the variance of reproductive\nsuccess is higher among males than among females, then the\npopulation will contain more patrisibs than matrisibs. However,\noffspring tend to maintain closer relations with mothers than\nwith fathers. Therefore, interactions are likely to have been\nmore intense with matrisibs (the products of female infidelity\nand partner change) than with patrisibs. My expectation is that\nmadumnally expressed genes will tend to promote cooperative\ninteractions among sibs whereas padumnally expressed genes\nwill favor competitive interactions.\nAsymmetries of relatedness are also present in a child\u2019s inter-\nactions with its extended family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles,\ncousins, nieces, and nephews are all, with rare exceptions, asym-\nmetric kin. Imprinted behaviors might play a role in broader\nfamily relations if a child\u2019s interactions were predominantly\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 271\nwith its mother\u2019s kin or its father\u2019s kin (or if children evolved\nspecific behaviors for interacting with patrilineal and matrilineal\nkin). Such asymmetries will have been determined by residence\npatterns and the stability of pair-bonds (Haig 2000a), whether\nmothers typically resided with their husband\u2019s kin or with their\nown kin, and whether children followed their mother or stayed\nwith their father after divorce.\nI foresee two principal challenges to predicting the effects of\nimprinted genes on social behaviors from evolutionary first prin-\nciples. The first challenge (discussed above) will be to understand\nevolutionarily salient patterns of asymmetric relatedness during\nhuman ancestry. The second will be to understand the principal\npsychological dimensions that have differentially affected matri-\nlineal and patrilineal inclusive fitness, given these asymmetries\nof relatedness. The latter challenge can be illustrated using the\nexample of a curious \u201cgift\u201d of individuals with Prader-Willi syn-\ndrome (PWS). Such individuals perform poorly on most cognitive\ntests but far outperform individuals from the general population\non the assembly of jigsaw puzzles (Dykens 2000). PWS is caused\nby the absence of expression of genes from padumnal chromo-\nsome 15q11\u201313. This suggests that padumnally expressed\ngenes favor relatively greater development of some psychological\nattribute that has, as a side-effect, poorer performance on fitting\ntogether colored pieces of cardboard. Kinship theory predicts\nthat stronger development of this attribute enhanced individual\nfitness at a cost to mothers or their families (or reduced individual\nfitness but conferred a benefit on fathers or their families). The\nchallenge is to understand the nature of the attribute that has\nbeen subject to natural selection and how expression of this attri-\nbute has differentially affected the fitness of mothers and fathers\n(or their respective kin).\nBoth challenges remain to be surmounted in the specific cases\nof autism and schizophrenia. Infantile onset of autism suggests\nthat the relevant genes may have been subject to selection based\non their effects on the mother\u2013infant relationship, whereas the\nolder age of onset of schizophrenia hints that the relevant genes\nmay have been subject to selection for their effects in wider kin\nnetworks. The greater challenge is understanding what psychologi-\ncal dimensions have been subject to selection and how variation\nalong these dimensions has affected matrilineal and patrilineal\nfitness. C&B suggest that autistic features are more pronounced\nin Angelman syndrome than in Prader-Willi syndrome, whereas\nVeltman et al. (2005) conclude the opposite. A detailed study of\nsocial behavior in these syndromes is a promising way forward.\nAre schizophrenics more religious?

Combined with the\ngeneralized Trivers-Willard hypothesis (gTWH), it suggests that\nschizophrenics have more daughters, and autistics have more sons, than\nexpected.\nAt the end of his book The Essential Difference, which argues that\nautism and autistic-spectrum syndrome may result from an\n\u201cextreme male brain,\u201d Simon Baron-Cohen asks, \u201cIs there an\nextreme female brain?\u201d (Baron-Cohen 2003, pp. 170\u201385).\nCrespi & Badcock (C&B) have now answered this question. Con-\ntrary to Baron-Cohen, who speculates that, if there is an extreme\nfemale brain, it would not be pathological, C&B suggest, with a\nconsiderable amount of supportive evidence, that an extreme\nfemale brain, the polar opposite of autism, may amount to schizo-\nphrenia and psychotic-spectrum syndrome.\nIf C&B are correct, which all available evidence strongly\nsuggests they may be, then their intragenomic conflict theory\nof the social brain immediately suggests a couple of novel hypo-\ntheses. First, recent evolutionary psychological theories (Atran\n2002; Boyer 2001; Guthrie 1993; Kirkpatrick 2005; Miller &\nKanazawa 2007, pp. 158\u201361) suggest that religion is not an adap-\ntation in itself but a by-product of other psychological adap-\ntations, variously named \u201cagency-detection mechanism\u201d or\n\u201canimistic bias.\u201d We may be evolutionarily designed to infer per-\nsonal and animistic intentions behind natural phenomena,\nbecause the consequence of erroneously overinferring inten-\ntions \u2013 being paranoid about perfectly natural phenomena \u2013 is\nmuch less costly in evolutionary terms than the consequence of\nerroneously underinferring intentions \u2013 being killed by preda-\ntors and enemies when we least expect them (Haselton &\nNettle 2006). We may therefore be designed to be paranoid\nbecause it can potentially save our lives, and we may be religious\nbecause we are paranoid and see the \u201chands of God\u201d behind com-\npletely natural phenomena.\nIf this view is correct, then C&B\u2019s theory suggests that schizo-\nphrenics, who are hypermentalistic and are more \u201cparanoid,\u201d\nmay be predisposed to be more religious, more prone to see\nthe hands of God behind natural phenomena, just as some\n(McNamara 2001; Miller & Kanazawa 2007, p. 206, n13)\nsuggest that autistics should be less religious because of their\nhypomentalism (absence of theory of mind). C&B identify \u201cover-\nestimation of meaningfulness of naturally occurring coinci-\ndences\u201d (sect. 6.1.3, para. 2) as one of the symptoms of\nschizophrenia.\nIn virtually all nations of the world, women are more religious\nthan men. While Alan S. Miller and I (Miller & Kanazawa 2007,\npp. 161\u201365; cf. Miller & Stark 2002) explain this in terms of\nwomen\u2019s greater tendency toward risk aversion, C&B\u2019s theory\nsuggests another explanation: If religion is mentalizing natural\nphenomena, and if the female brain tends toward mentalizing,\nthen women should naturally be more religious.\nSecond, in an entirely different area, the generalized Trivers-\nWillard hypothesis (gTWH) (Kanazawa 2005) proposes that\nparents who possess any heritable trait which increases male\nreproductive success at a greater rate (or decreases male repro-\nductive success at a smaller rate) than female reproductive\nsuccess in a given environment, will have higher-than-expected\noffspring sex ratios (more sons). Conversely, parents who\npossess any heritable trait which increases female reproductive\nsuccess at a greater rate (or decreases female reproductive\nsuccess at a smaller rate) than male reproductive success in a\ngiven environment, will have lower-than-expected offspring sex\nratios (more daughters). Because body size and tendency\ntoward violence are distinct advantages in male intrasexual com-\npetition for mates and status, big and tall parents are more likely\nto have sons (Kanazawa 2005; 2007b), and violent men are more\nlikely to have sons (Kanazawa 2006). Because physical attractive-\nness, while an advantage for both men and women, is even\na greater advantage for women than for men, more beautiful\nparents are more likely to have daughters (Kanazawa 2007a).\nBecause language and communication are more important to\nwomen, and thus language impairment is relatively more costly\nfor them, mothers (though not fathers) with a developmental\nlanguage impairment have more sons than daughters (Tallal\net al. 1989).\nI have applied the gTWH to brain types and shown that those\nwith \u201cstrong male brains,\u201d such as engineers, mathematicians,\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n272 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nand scientists, are more likely to have sons, because the male\nbrain is more adaptive for boys. In contrast, those with \u201cstrong\nfemale brains,\u201d such as nurses, social workers, and kindergarten\nteachers, are more likely to have daughters, because the female\nbrain is more adaptive for girls (Kanazawa & Vandermassen\n2005). If autism and autistic-spectrum syndrome are the result\nof \u201cextreme male brains,\u201d as Baron-Cohen (2003) suggests,\nthen autistics should have more sons. Conversely, if schizo-\nphrenia and psychotic-spectrum syndrome are the result of\n\u201cextreme female brains,\u201d or hyper-mentalism, as C&B propose,\nthen they should have more daughters. Although C&B cite a\nlarge number of studies to demonstrate that first-degree relatives\nof schizophrenics have more children (sect. 6.4), they do not\nreveal (nor do I know) whether schizophrenics and their relatives\nhave lower offspring sex ratios (more daughters). This prediction\nassumes that the genetic tendency toward schizophrenia is heri-\ntable, which is reasonable, given that the genetic tendency\ntoward autism appears heritable (Baron-Cohen et al. 1998).\nThere is one potential confound, however. If lighter birth\nweight and slower postnatal growth of schizophrenics, and\nheavier birth weight and faster postnatal growth of autistics,\nwhich C&B document, continue throughout development, then\nautistics on average should have larger adult stature than schizo-\nphrenics. If this is the case, then autistics should be expected to\nhave more sons, and schizophrenics more daughters, purely\nbecause of their body size (Kanazawa 2005; 2007b). It would\ntherefore be necessary to control for body size in order to deter-\nmine the partial effect of autism and schizophrenia on offspring\nsex ratios. While, given their low frequency in the population,\nit would be difficult to detect the effect of autism and schizo-\nphrenia on offspring sex ratios in representative samples, one\nshould be able to determine, with clinical samples of autistics\nand schizophrenics with children, whether their offspring sex\nratios significantly deviate from the normal secondary sex ratio\nof .5122 (105 boys for 100 girls).\nProblems with the imprinting hypothesis of\nschizophrenia and autism\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004342\nMatthew C. Keller\nDepartment of Psychology and Institute for Behavioral Genetics, University of\nColorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO 80309.\nmatthew.c.keller@gmail.com www.matthewckeller.com\nAbstract: Crespi & Badcock (C&B) convincingly argue that autism and\nschizophrenia are diametric malfunctions of the social brain, but their\ncore imprinting hypothesis is less persuasive. Much of the evidence\nthey cite is unrelated to their hypothesis, is selective, or is overstated;\ntheir hypothesis lacks a clearly explained mechanism; and it is unclear\nhow their explanation fits in with known aspects of the disorders.\nCrespi & Badcock (C&B) have done a wonderful job synthesizing\na prodigious amount of information on schizophrenia and autism.\nIn doing so, they have made a convincing case that these dis-\norders are diametric malfunctions of the social brain. On a\nsurprisingly large number of anatomical and cognitive dimen-\nsions, schizophrenia (or at least its positive symptoms; negative\nsymptoms hold an awkward place in the target article) and\nautism appear to be diametrically opposed. Unfortunately, the\nevidence C&B bring to bear on their central imprinting hypoth-\nesis is less convincing. In the following paragraphs, I expand\nupon this and other reservations.\nMuch of the evidence C&B discuss is unrelated to their core\nhypothesis. C&B\u2019s core hypothesis is that if gene expression is\npaternally biased, offspring should attempt to extract more\nmaternal resources (increasing autism risk as a side effect) than\nif gene expression is maternally biased (increasing schizophrenia\nrisk). However, the bulk of C&B\u2019s evidence (lateralization, hemi-\nspheric dysfunction, mirror neuron dysregulation), and especially\ntheir behavioral evidence (gaze sensitivity, delusions, theory of\nmind, etc.) has little to do with the offspring\u2019s extraction of\nmaternal resources. Possibly a mentalistic cognitive style\n(related to schizophrenia) could make a child easier to raise,\nbut it also could easily do the opposite by enabling the child to\nbe better at playing social chess. C&B state that autistic traits\nappear to impose fitness costs to mothers, but so too would\ntraits related to virtually any childhood-onset psychiatric dis-\norder. The evidence C&B present favoring schizophrenic\/schi-\nzotypic behavioral traits being less costly to mothers has to do\nwith fertility of schizophrenic relatives (of questionable validity;\nsee further on). But this is a red herring: Of relevance to their\nhypothesis is whether schizotypic traits reduce maternal invest-\nment, not whether they increase fertility.\nSimilarly, C&B conflate two very different issues: maleness\nversus femaleness, on the one hand, and paternal versus\nmaternal gene expression, on the other. Much of C&B\u2019s evi-\ndence (Table 1 of the target article) seems more directly\nrelated to extreme male versus female brains, rather than to\nextreme paternal versus maternal gene expression. C&B\nappreciate this but seem to hedge: \u201cBy this model, the two\naxes overlap partially but broadly with one another, such that\nthe so-called male brain is relatively similar . . . to a brain\nbiased towards increased influence of paternally expressed\nimprinted genes\u201d (sect. 7, para. 5). No explanation is provided\nfor this striking statement, despite the fact that it is not\nobvious why these two axes would be related. Paternally\nexpressed genes are expressed in both male and female off-\nspring, and to my knowledge have no inherent relationship to\nmaleness versus femaleness. By analogy, it would be wrong to\nassume that IGF-II protein levels are higher in males than\nfemales simply because the Igf2 gene is paternally active\n(indeed, its levels are the same in males and females; Juul\net al. 1995). For the same reason, it is wrong for C&B to\npresume that a maleness\u2013autism association is consistent\nwith increased paternally expressed genes, or vice versa for a\nfemaleness-schizophrenia association.\nC&B\u2019s core hypothesis lacks a clearly explained mec-\nhanism. C&B do not provide a clear explanation for why the\nputative imbalance in paternally and maternally gene expression\noccurs. Other disorders related to such an imbalance (e.g.,\nPrader-Willi and Angelman syndromes) occur due to deletions,\nduplications, or uniparental disomy of specific chromosomal\nareas \u2013 but these causes are rare, and the disorders caused by\nthem are commensurately rare (about 1 in 20,000). Schizo-\nphrenia and autism are, on the other hand, 50 (autism) to 200\n(schizophrenia) times more common than either Prader-Willi\nor Angelman syndrome (Jablensky et al. 1992; Rutter 2005).\nWhat specific mechanism is being proposed that causes an imbal-\nance in imprinted gene expression, and why does the imbalance\noccur so often? Moreover, what explains the heritability of autism\nand schizophrenia? Without a clear description of the mechan-\nism that causes the putative imbalance, these questions can be\nanswered only vaguely, making it difficult to derive quantifiable\npredictions from the hypothesis.\nC&B fail to discuss counter-evidence and overstate suppor-\ntive evidence. First, C&B state \u201cimprinted genes comprise only\nabout 1% of the genome,\u201d (sect. 3, para. 2) but in fact the percen-\ntage is much smaller. C&B presumably intended to say 1% of\ngenes rather than 1% of the entire genome. However, even this\n1% figure (around 250 genes) would be too high \u2013 60 to 80\ngenes are known to be imprinted in humans (Imprinted Gene\nCatalog; http:\/\/igc.otago.ac.nz\/home.html). Given that only a\nsubset of these 60\u201380 genes is likely to be involved in autism\nand schizophrenia risk, it is, again, difficult to see how imprinting\nin such a small subset of genes could malfunction often enough to\nproduce the rates and heritabilities observed for the two disorders.\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 273\nSecond, the most direct prediction from C&B\u2019s hypothesis is\nthat imprinted genes are over-represented among genes affecting\nschizophrenia and autism risk. Evidence is available but was only\nselectively discussed by C&B. Imprinted genes tend to occur in\nclusters; over half of them (47) are found in just three regions:\n7q32, 11p15, and 14q32. However, the same meta-analysis dis-\ncussed by C&B (Lewis et al. 2003) did not find any of these\nregions to be among the top 19 most likely schizophrenia gene\nregions (see Lewis et al. 2003, Table 2). On the other hand,\ndata indicating likely linkage peaks near 7q32 for autism\n(Badner & Gershon 2002) seems to support C&B\u2019s hypothesis\nwith respect to autism.\nThird, C&B overstate the evidence for increased fertility\namong relatives of schizophrenics. C&B note that \u201cone or more\ncategory\u201d of first-degree relatives have higher fertility (sect.\n6.4), but such \u201csupportive\u201d evidence includes, for example, the\nfertility of sisters but not brothers \u2013 even when overall sister-\nplus-brother fertility is lower than the general population\n(Haukka et al. 2003). Such selective presentation of the data is\nfrustrating. If one studied any group (e.g., men with arthritis)\nand conditioned on enough relative classes (e.g., number of\nmaternal siblings, cf. Fan\u02dcana\u00b4s & Bertranpetit 1995), significant\nfertility differences could probably be found somewhere. A\nmore balanced presentation of the data would show that siblings\nand offspring of schizophrenics have equal or lower fertility com-\npared to the general population (Bassett et al. 1996; Haukka et al.\n2003; McGlashan et al. 2006; McGrath et al. 1999; Rimmer &\nJacobsen 1976; Srinivasan & Padmavati 1997; Svensson et al.\n2007), whereas parents of schizophrenics have equal or higher\nfertility (Avila et al. 2001; McGlashan et al. 2006; Srinivasan &\nPadmavati 1997; Svensson et al. 2007; Waddington & Youssef\n1996). As noted by C&B, data on higher parental fertility is\nambiguous because it could simply indicate that lower parental\ninvestment (pre- or postnatally), which must occur in larger sib-\nships, is a schizophrenia risk factor.\nHow does evidence for a mutational role in schizophrenia and\nautism risk fit in with C&B\u2019s hypothesis? C&B ignore the com-\npelling and growing evidence that both new and circulating\ndeleterious mutations play an important role in autism and schizo-\nphrenia risk (reviewed in Keller & Miller 2006; McClellan et al.\n2007). Indirect evidence includes: (a) the apparent fitness costs\nof autism and schizophrenia; (b) the likely effect sizes of suscepti-\nbility alleles; and (c) the increased risks of schizophrenia and\/or\nautism with brain trauma, inbreeding, paternal age, and ionizing\nradiation. More direct evidence based on DNA sequencing or\ncopy number detection is increasingly available and also supports\na mutational role (Cheng & Chen 2007; Durand et al. 2007; Lencz\net al. 2007; Sebat et al. 2007; Sutcliffe et al. 2005). It would be\nuseful for C&B to clarify whether they consider mutations as a\ncontributing cause of the imbalance itself, or an unrelated and\nadditional mechanism (one of the \u201cmyriad causes,\u201d sect. 1), or\ninconsistent with their hypothesis.\nHypo- or hyper-mentalizing: It all depends\nupon what one means by \u201cmentalizing\u201d\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004354\nRobyn Langdon and Jon Brock\nMacquarie Centre for Cognitive Science, Macquarie University, Sydney,\nNew South Wales 2109, Australia.\nrlangdon@maccs.mq.edu.au\nhttp:\/\/www.maccs.mq.edu.au\/members\/profile.htm?memberID\u00bc60\njbrock@maccs.mq.edu.au\nhttp:\/\/www.maccs.mq.edu.au\/members\/profile.htm?memberID\u00bc203\nAbstract:By conceiving of autism and psychosis as diametrically opposite\nphenotypes of underactive and overactive mentalizing, respectively,\nCrespi & Badcock (C&B) commit themselves to a continuum view of\nintercorrelated mentalizing functions. This view fails to acknowledge\ndissociations between mentalizing functions and that psychotic people\nshow a mixture of both hypo- and hyper-mentalizing.\nCrespi & Badcock (C&B) envisage a continuum of mentalistic\ncognition, affect, and behaviour with normality at the centre\nand autism and psychosis at opposite dysfunctional poles:\nAutism reflects a bias toward paternally expressed genes and\nhypo-mentalizing; psychosis reflects a bias toward maternally\nexpressed genes and hyper-mentalizing. This commentary is\nrestricted primarily to the cognitive level of this model.\nThe implication of C&B\u2019s model is that capacities for a suite of\nmentalizing functions all vary roughly in line with each other as\none moves along the continuum. This conception is at odds with\nfindings of dissociations between mentalizing functions. Psycho-\npaths, for example, show good cognitive mentalizing (they under-\nstand other people\u2019s thoughts well enough to adeptly manipulate\nand deceive those others) alongside a lack of empathy (i.e., poor\naffective mentalizing: Blair 2005). Of more direct relevance to\nC&B\u2019s model, psychotic people report the opposite pattern: a dif-\nficulty with understanding other people\u2019s thoughts (i.e., poor cog-\nnitive mentalizing) alongside intact affective empathy (Montag\net al. 2007). To treat mentalizing as a unidimensional continuum\nof intercorrelated functions is an oversimplification.\nIt therefore becomes important to focus on more specific social-\ncognitive domains: processing of eye-gaze information, using men-\ntalistic language to communicate about minds, theory of mind\n(ToM), and so forth. Within each domain, the strongest test of\nC&B\u2019s proposal is to compare data collected from autistic and psy-\nchotic individuals using similar paradigms. To illustrate, Langdon\net al. (2006b) used cues of other people\u2019s gaze-direction to orient\nsubjects\u2019 own attentional shifts and found evidence that automatic\norienting to gaze might be heightened in psychotic people. Autism\nstudies of this type are more common, but the findings are mixed.\nRistic et al. (2003) found an absence of rapid, automatic orienting\nto static eye-gaze cues in autistic subjects \u2013 broadly the opposite of\nLangdon et al.\u2019s findings. However, two further studies using pro-\ncedures more comparable to the Langdon study reported normal\nreflexive orienting to eye-gaze in autism (Senju et al. 2004; Swet-\ntenham et al. 2003). While aspects of processing eye-gaze infor-\nmation are clearly impaired in autism, it seems unreasonable to\nsummarily describe autism and psychosis as polar opposites.\nDirect comparisons can also be made between studies in\nwhich participants described interactions between animated geo-\nmetric shapes. Several studies have reported a reduced usage of\nmentalistic language (e.g., the large triangle is encouraging\nthe small triangle) by autistic individuals when describing\n\u201cToM scenes\u201d of complex social interactions (Castelli et al.\n2002; Klin & Jones 2006; although see Abell et al. 2000). While\nautistic individuals under-mentalize, Russell et al. (2006) found\nthat paranoid psychotic patients over-mentalize in this paradigm,\nascribing intentions to random movements designed as non-ToM\ncontrol stimuli. Crucially, however, these same patients also\nunder-mentalized in the ToM condition; just like the autistic\nindividuals, they used significantly less mentalistic language\nthan controls to describe animations of socially complex\nbehaviours.\nLikewise, Langdon (2005) found that schizophrenic patients\nevidenced both under- and over-mentalizing within the same\njoke-appreciation task. When presented with ToM cartoons\nthat required accurate mental-state inferences in order to get\nthe joke, these patients used less mental-state language than\nhealthy controls and acted as if completely insensitive to the\nlikely contents of the cartoon characters\u2019 minds. Yet these same\nindividuals also over-mentalized in a non-mentalistic control con-\ndition where they ascribed negative intentions to innocent\ncartoon characters.\nA \u201chyper-mentalizing\u201d account seems inadequate here. Indi-\nviduals with psychosis do over-attribute intentions in some con-\ntexts, but in others they under-mentalize. One argument might\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n274 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nbe that stimuli used in ToM tasks activate too many mental-state\nrepresentations in psychotic people. This would explain the\noveruse but not the underuse of mentalistic language. Arguably\na greater interference between competing mental-state represen-\ntations might leave patients more confused in ToM conditions.\nBut why should this lead to less mentalistic language, and what\ncauses the greater interference anyway?\nAn alternative conceptualisation of hyper-mentalizing relates\nto the inappropriate attribution of self-knowledge to other\npeople. This could explain why psychotic individuals fail to\ninfer those more complex mental states like trickery that typically\nfeature in ToM conditions, described above, as well as in more\nclassic ToM tasks. This argument, however, appears incompati-\nble with the persecutory-deluded people\u2019s common complaints\nthat other people do not truly understand them. Why so, if\nthey over-attribute to others what they themselves know? More-\nover, in both autism and psychosis, there seems a difficulty with\nsetting aside self-knowledge so as to appreciate another person\u2019s\nunique subjective world. This is the very essence of ToM, so what\ndoes it mean to say that one is hypo while the other is hyper?\nAn alternative viewpoint is provided by Langdon and colleagues\n(Langdon 2003; Langdon & Coltheart 2001; Langdon et al. 2001).\nThey propose that poor ToM task performance in schizophrenia\nreflects impaired perspective-taking (i.e., a difficulty with enter-\ntaining multiple perspectives of the same here-and-now reality).\nImpaired perspective-taking explains the egocentric projection of\npsychotic people\u2019s own suspicions and biases onto innocent\nothers and ambiguous situations (over-mentalizing) as well as\ntheir failure to grasp the interplay between different perspectives\nin more complex social interactions (under-mentalizing).\nIn sum, any theory contrasting autism and psychosis must take\naccount of comparable studies of the two disorders rather than\nrelying on general descriptions. Few such comparisons have\nbeen conducted, but when relevant data exist, they point to simi-\nlarities as well as differences. Therefore, regardless of any pro-\ngress at the genetic or neurological level, we suggest that\nC&B\u2019s mentalizing spectrum must be better specified cogni-\ntively. There are differences, for example, among the following:\nThe capacity to represent \u201cdecoupled\u201d mental states (as about\nyet separate from the world)\nThe ability to respond to and interpret eye-gaze cues\nThe tendency to ascribe psychological causation to random or\nambiguous stimuli\nThe ability to appreciate other people\u2019s likely thoughts in light\nof their circumstances (i.e., perspective taking)\nSome of these faculties are intact in psychotic people but some\nare impaired. For some faculties, it might be possible to conceive\nof a continuum with pathological hypo- and hyper-abilities at\nopposite poles. For others, it seems unclear how hyper-abilities\nmight be manifested.\nWhy is creativity attractive in a potential mate?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004366\nDaniel Nettle\nCentre for Behaviour and Evolution, Newcastle University, Newcastle NE2\n4HH, United Kingdom.\nDaniel.nettle@ncl.ac.uk www.danielnettle.info\nAbstract: A number of studies suggest that women find artistically\ncreative men attractive, especially in the short-term mating context.\nArtistic creativity (but not mathematical or technical creativity) is\nlinked to psychosis-proneness. I hypothesise that in preferring\nartistically creative men, women may be choosing paternal genotypes\nthat make babies that are not excessively somatically demanding on them.\nCrespi & Badcock\u2019s (C&B\u2019s) magisterial article sets up a host of\nimportant and novel hypotheses about the phenotypes of psychosis\nand autism, the genetic and developmental mechanisms under-\nlying these pathologies, normal variation in milder psychosis-like\nand autistic-like traits, and sex and parent-of-origin differences\nin all of the above. Here, I wish to focus briefly on possible impli-\ncations of their thesis for one related area: the role of artistic crea-\ntivity in male sexual attractiveness.\nA number of lines of evidence suggest that artistic creativity is\nfound sexually attractive. Nettle and Clegg (2006) found that\npoets and artists had more sexual partners than community con-\ntrols, a finding repeated for males in a different population of\nvisual artists in Clegg\u2019s (2006) doctoral study, which additionally\nshowed that the increased number of partners stemmed from a\nmore short-term mating strategy. Haselton and Miller (2006)\ndevised vignettes of poor but creative versus rich but uncreative\nmen. Women in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle shifted\npreference towards the poor but creative man for a potential\nshort-term mate (long-term preferences were unaffected). Such\nmenstrual cycle shifts are thought to maximise genetic quality\nat the expense of, say, propensity to provide parental investment.\nFinally, Griskevicius et al. (2006) found that whenever men were\ngiven cues designed to activate mating goals, they displayed more\ncreativity in a number of tasks. This suggests a male response to\ngeneral female interest in male creativity as a mate-selection\nindicator.\nA standard account of these findings might be the following:\nCreativity is closely linked to general intelligence, and general\nintelligence is a consequence of the overall functional efficiency\nof the nervous system. This in turn will be affected by numerous\ndevelopmental factors, including genetic mutational load. The\nsubstantial correlation of measured general intelligence to phys-\nical symmetry, long used by biologists as a marker of develop-\nmental quality, supports the relationship of general intelligence\nto mutational load (Prokosch et al. 2005). Thus, creativity is sig-\nnalling intelligence which is signalling good overall genetic\nquality (Haselton & Miller 2006; Miller 2000).\nThis account appears plausible enough, but there is an unre-\nsolved issue. Why is it particularly artistic-type creativity \u2013 na-\nmely, remote verbal and visual associations \u2013 which is found to\nbe attractive? Mathematical, technical, or engineering ability\ncould equally well signal high intelligence, and indeed, these\nkinds of capacities would have been very useful for survival in\nthe ancestral environment. It is here that the connection to the\nautism-psychosis spectrum comes in. Artistically creative indivi-\nduals tend to score highly on measures of psychosis-proneness,\nwhile mathematicians have unusually low scores, and if anything\nare more autistic-like in their psychological profiles (Baron-\nCohen et al. 1998; Nettle 2006). Both groups have high general\nintelligence, but it appears to be the artistic types who are attrac-\ntive for short-term matings and have increased number of part-\nners (Nettle & Clegg 2006). Hence, it appears that it is not just\ngeneral intelligence which is a mate-choice indicator, but also\nthe position on the spectrum from hyper-mentalising, psycho-\nsis-prone, to hypo-mentalising, autism-prone, with the hyper-\nmentalising end of the spectrum the more attractive one.\nTwo possible explanations spring to mind. One is that mildly\nhyper-mentalising individuals are better partners to have,\nbecause, being people people, they take into account the needs\nand desires of others. Thus, creative behaviour could simply be sig-\nnalling one\u2019s type in terms of post-reproductive cooperativeness\n(see Nettle & Clegg 2007 for some discussion). However, if so,\nthen creative individuals should be especially preferred in the\nlong-term mating context, whereas all the evidence suggests that\nhighly creative individuals tend to follow short-term mating strat-\negy and are preferred in the short-term, genetic-contribution-only\ncontext, rather than for long-term investment.\nC&B\u2019s article suggests an intriguing alternative: hyper-menta-\nlising, psychosis-prone males are signalling that their genotype is\nsuch that their babies will not make excessive demands on their\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 275\nmothers. C&B show that psychosis-proneness is associated with\nsmaller, slower growing, less demanding babies, whereas\nautism-proneness is associated with the opposite. They also\nargue that the remote associations found in schizotypy and artis-\ntic creativity are a direct (and therefore unfakable) consequence\nof having a brain whose growth pattern is of the psychosis-\nprone \u2013 and therefore less costly for the mother \u2013 type.\nThis hypothesis is not implausible. Human reproduction\nmakes extremely high metabolic demands on females. Rates of\nmaternal death in pregnancy, and during or soon after birth,\nare as high as 2% per pregnancy in the poorest countries even\ntoday (World Health Organisation 2007), and would have been\nhigher under ancestral conditions. The Haigian model of\npaternal\u2013maternal conflict under multiple paternity predicts\nthat paternal interests will tolerate a greater risk of harm or\ndeath to the mother than would be optimal from the point of\nview of the maternal genome. This tussle is partly carried out\nat the level of genetic imprints and counter-imprints, but can\nalso be carried out in the arena of mate choice. If the female\ncan find cues that discriminate males on the basis of how strongly\ntheir genotype is going to favour the patrilineal interest, she\nshould exploit them. Such cues should be of particular interest\nin the short-term mating case, where genetic material is all that\nis being provided. In the long-term case, the additional costs of\noffspring of autistic-prone individuals could be offset by their\npropensity to make paternal behavioural investment.\nThe hypothesis, speculative as it is, could lead to testable pre-\ndictions. Further investigation is needed into whether the young\noffspring of highly schizotypal or creative males are indeed\nsmaller or less demanding than the babies of more autistic-\nprone individuals, and also of women\u2019s intuitions about the desir-\nability of such men as partners. One prediction might be that\nwomen whose own somatic resources are limited (health pro-\nblems, small size) should be especially keen on schizotypal-crea-\ntive versus autism-prone males as partners. This would indicate\nthat these traits are being used as mate-choice indicators for\nthe reasons invoked.\nIt is a great testament to the breadth and importance of C&B\u2019s\ntarget article that it allows novel predictions to be generated\nabout something so far removed from their initial concern.\nCortical plasticity: A proposed mechanism by\nwhich genomic factors lead to the behavioral\nand neurological phenotype of autism\nspectrum and psychotic-spectrum disorders\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004378\nLindsay M. Oberman and Alvaro Pascual-Leone\nBerenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, Department of\nNeurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical\nSchool, Boston, MA 02215.\nloberman@bidmc.harvard.edu\napleone@bidmc.harvard.edu\nAbstract: Crespi & Badcock (C&B) hypothesize that biases toward\nexpression of paternally or maternally imprinted genes lead to the\nsymptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and psychotic-spectrum\ndisorders (PSD), respectively. We suggest that such genetic risk factors\nmay act by inducing abnormalities in developmental and learning-\nrelated plasticity. We provide preliminary evidence of abnormal\nplasticity in ASD and suggest transcranial magnetic stimulation as a\nuseful tool to investigate as well as influence cortical plasticity.\nThe target article suggests that the symptoms of autism spectrum\ndisorders (ASD) and psychotic-spectrum disorders (PSD) are\nmediated by altered biases toward paternally or maternally\nexpressed genes, respectively. This hypothesis fits well with the\nexisting literature, and provides a potential genotype that acts\ntogether with brain development and environmental factors to\ncreate the complex phenotypes that define these disorders.\nThough understanding the genetic underpinning of these dis-\norders is of critical importance, diagnosis usually occurs around\nage 2\u20133 in ASD and during adolescence or later in PSD. Thus,\nthe phenotypic presentation is a result of the complex interaction\namong genetic risk factors, brain development, and environment,\nand ultimately the manifestation of brain plasticity. It is worth\nconsidering whether the mechanisms of plasticity might be\nnormal, simply acting upon a genetically determined abnormal\nsubstrate, or may themselves be pathological, thus contributing\nto progressively dysfunctional states.\nThere are several pieces of evidence to support abnormal plas-\nticity in ASD. First, the developmental trajectory of brain size\nabnormalities suggests a dynamic underlying process. Second,\nstudies have found decreased cortico-cortical and long-range con-\nnections and an increase in intracortical and superficial connec-\ntions. Such patterns of abnormal connectivity might be the\nresult of increased ability to form new connections and\/or a\ndecreased ability to prune superfluous ones. Abnormal plasticity\nis also consistent with the phenotype of PSD, which has also\nbeen reported to have abnormal connectivity patterns. Though\nthere are inconsistencies in the findings, one study finds increased\ncorpus callosum size with decreased local connections (Siekmeier\n& Hoffman 2002). Additionally, the lower levels of BDNF in\nschizophrenia (Moises et al. 2002; Palomino et al. 2006; Weickert\net al. 2003) may also be related to abnormal plasticity. A recent\nstudy suggests that there is a relationship between having a specific\npolymorphism in the BDNF gene and experience-dependent\nmotor plasticity (Kleim et al. 2006).\nAbnormal plasticity provides a plausible, parsimonious, and\ntestable mechanism, consistent with both the main proposal of\nthe target article, as well as the core phenotypes of ASD and\nPSD. Studies are currently underway to evaluate the role of plas-\nticity in the etiology of ASD using transcranial magnetic stimu-\nlation (TMS). TMS paradigms can capture aspects of\nhomosynaptic and heterosynaptic plasticity (see Hallett 2007\nfor a review). A paradigm known as theta burst stimulation\n(TBS) is well-suited for investigating homosynaptic plasticity\nand allows a rapid conditioning of the motor cortex that produces\ncontrollable, consistent, and long-lasting effects on motor physi-\nology and behavior. In typical individuals, TBS for 20\u201390\nseconds results in suppression of the motor evoked potential\n(MEP) for up to 30 minutes. Preliminary data suggest this\neffect is greater in both degree and duration in individuals with\nASD. (See Fig. 1.)\nPaired associative stimulation (PAS) is well-suited for investi-\ngations of heterosynaptic plasticity and ability for the motor\ncortex to form long term potentiation (LTP) and long term\ndepression (LTD) in response to sensory input. PAS involves\nstimulation of the median nerve combined with TMS over the\nmotor cortex at variable interstimulus intervals (ISI). At 25\nmsec ISI the MEP shows facilitation, while an ISI of 10 msec\ninhibits the MEP. Both effects are amplified in individuals with\nASD. (See Fig. 2.)\nAbnormal patterns of plasticity may be leading to the abnormal\nconnectivity in ASD, which in turn may be mediating the deficits\nin social and communicative skills (as these skills require syn-\nchronization of neuronal populations across relatively disparate\nregions of the cortex) as well as the restricted, repetitive, and\nstereotyped patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities.\nAbnormal plasticity may also lead to increased long-range\nconnections in PSD, perhaps contributing to the complex social\ndelusions, enhanced imagination and creativity, and \u201cloose\u201d\nassociations between words and aspects of the environment in\nthis population.\nThough the genetic predisposition toward maternally or pater-\nnally expressed genes might predispose a child for developing\nthese disorders, the recent increase in incidence can better be\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n276 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\naccounted for by a change in environment rather than an\nincrease in the penetrance of the genetic risk factor. Children\ngrowing up in recent years are being exposed to an ever more\ndiverse and stimulating environment packed with stimuli to\nprocess from very early on. In a child who is predisposed to\nincreased plasticity, this overly stimulating environment could\nlead to deleterious consequences. In such a setting, ASD\ngenetic risk factors may lead to a facilitated, insufficiently con-\ntrolled reshaping of neural connections. The child may develop\nlocal hyperconnectivity, a surge in brain size, and an inefficient\nprocessing system for incoming sensory stimuli. If, however,\nthis child is placed in a very structured environment and develops\na specific interest, this enhanced plasticity may actually lead to\nsavant abilities.\nOne can also consider the opposite scenario with a child who is\ngenetically at risk for developing PSD with an increased bias\ntoward effects of genes with maternal expression leading to\nuncontrollable increased global connectivity. Later in life when\nmore associative long-range connections are maturing, abnormal\nplasticity in this population would lead to the characteristic posi-\ntive symptoms of PSD.\nTMS can be used not only to measure the degree of plasticity\nin a given system, but also as a valuable tool for clinicians deve-\nloping therapeutic interventions for these disorders. Specifically,\nrepetitive TMS (rTMS) has been shown to produce long-term\n(several-month) changes in cortical plasticity and has been effec-\ntive in other brain diseases, for example, depression.\nIn conclusion, Crespi & Badcock (C&B) present an interesting\nhypothesis for genetic factors that may lead to ASD and PSD. We\nsuggest that abnormal plasticity may be the common underlying\nmechanism that ultimately leads to many of the core behavioral\ndeficits which define these disorders. The manifestation of the\nspecific pattern of abnormal plasticity may lie in the timing of\nthe hyperplastic response. Specifically, if hyperplasticity is pro-\nmoted early in life, this may preferentially affect local circuits,\nresulting in ASD. However, PSD may result from abnormal plas-\nticity during adolescence and young adulthood, leading to pro-\nmotion of long-range hyperplasticity. Such conceptualization\nprovides an appealing account for the increase in incidence of\nASD and PSD in our highly stimulating society. Finally, modu-\nlation of plasticity may provide an effective means to treat\nthese disorders.\nA complete theory of psychosis and autism as\ndiametric disorders of social brain must\nconsider full range of clinical syndromes\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X0800438X\nKatharine N.

We raise two\nmain objections: (1) the autistic-psychotic continuum, as conceptualized\nby the authors, excludes defining features of schizophrenia spectrum:\nnegative symptoms, which correlate more strongly with mentalizing\nimpairments; and (2) little evidence exists for a relationship between\nmentalizing ability and positive symptoms.\nCrespi & Badcock\u2019s (C&B\u2019s) novel and bold theory places autism\nspectrum disorders (ASD) and psychotic-spectrum disorders\n(PSD) on diametrically opposite ends of a spectrum, with under-\ndeveloped social cognition in ASD and hyper-developed social\ncognition in PSD. The authors represent schizophrenia at the\nextreme end of PSD and discuss their genetic imprinting hypo-\nthesis of hyper-mentalizing in PSD mainly in the context of\nschizophrenia. However, although the authors acknowledge the\nmultifaceted nature of the disorder, they fail to adequately con-\nsider it in the construction of their theory.\nOne underlying problemwith placing schizophrenia and ASD at\nextreme poles is that the major symptoms of schizophrenia do not\ncohere with this method of distinction. Schizophrenia is character-\nized by positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations,\nand negative symptoms that reflect a diminution or loss of\nnormal functions such as alogia, anergia, and anhedonia. Positive\nsymptoms fluctuate over time and can be ameliorated by antipsy-\nchotic medication, but negative symptoms are treatment-resistant\nand enduring. C&B\u2019s theory focuses on schizophrenia to represent\nFigure 2 (Oberman & Pascual-Leone).

Note the greater degree and longer duration of\nsuppression in the ASD group.\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 277\nthe psychotic spectrum, yet the more trait-like negative symptoms\nare largely ignored.\nThe process of hyper-mentalizing, which results in increased\nsuspiciousness, is best related to one component of positive symp-\ntoms, namely, paranoia and persecutory delusions. Although it is a\ntheoretically reasonable argument that hyper-mentalizing is\nrelated to paranoid delusions, it is difficult to make the same argu-\nment for the negative symptoms. Thus the borders of C&B\u2019s autis-\ntic-psychotic continuum must be redrawn.\nIt is possible to constrain C&B\u2019s theory to address the positive\nrather than negative symptoms, but empirical data pose further\ncomplications. Here we focus on one aspect of social cognition,\ntheory of mind (ToM), which is the ability to attribute mental\nstates to oneself and others, and we consider the nature of ToM\ndeficits in schizophrenia and the relationship between these defi-\ncits and clinical symptoms. An abundance of empirical evidence\npoints to mentalizing deficits in both PSD (i.e., schizophrenia,\nschizotypy) and ASD. C&B propose that the underlying deficit\ndetermining impaired social cognition in autism is an inability to\ntheorize about the mental states of others (hypo-mentalizing).\nIndeed, evidence for ToM deficits in autism is robust (Baron-\nCohen 1995). In the case of schizophrenia, there is also good evi-\ndence for the presence of ToM deficit (for review, see Bru\u00a8ne\n2005), but very little evidence exists for the hypothesis that schizo-\nphrenia involves hyper-mentalizing about the mental states of\nothers. Moreover, ToM deficits in schizophrenia may stem from\nexecutive or planning deficits (Hardy-Bayle\u00b4 1994) or an inability\nto integrate contextual information (Hardy-Bayle\u00b4 et al. 2003).\nThus, both ASD and PSD involve impaired social cognition, but\nthe reasons for these deficits may not lie on the same continuum\nof mentalizing ability.\nWith respect to the positive symptoms, persecutory delu-\nsions may arise when individuals mislabel actions of others\n(Frith 1992), and therefore one may expect a correlation\nbetween persecutory delusions and ToM deficits. However,\nevidence for this relationship is inconclusive at best, in contrast\nto the more consistent evidence of a relationship between nega-\ntive symptoms and ToM deficits (Freeman 2007). C&B point\nout that psychotic symptoms are not just present in schizo-\nphrenia, but also present in other conditions, including\ndepressive psychosis, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder (PTSD), paranoid personality disorder, dementia, and\nepilepsy. Persecutory delusions are one of the most common\nfeatures of psychosis, occurring in almost 50% of cases (Sartor-\nius et al. 1986). If paranoid ideation and persecutory delusions\nare the components of psychosis most directly linked to hyper-\nmentalizing, then there should be an association between these\nexperiences and ToM deficits. However, Walston et al. (2000)\nfound no evidence for ToM deficits in participants with pure\npersecutory delusions.\nFurthermore, C&B argue that non-pathological points on the\npsychosis spectrum are most useful in evaluating their hypo-\nthesis. However, even in healthy schizotypal individuals, those\nwho score high on psychometric measures of schizotypal person-\nality, ToM deficits were related to the negative syndrome and not\nwith the positive syndrome (Langdon & Coltheart 1999). With\nrespect to the non-pathological individuals on the spectrum,\nthere is an additional complication. Machiavellian intelligence,\nthat is, social intelligence used as a means of social manipulation\nin order to attain goals, can improve social cognitive functioning\nwhen applied appropriately in context. Therefore, controlled and\nintentional hyper-mentalizing, even if extreme, should correlate\nwith enhanced ToM and effective social behavior. In other\nwords, is there room for Sherlock Holmes in C&B\u2019s spectrum?\nMoreover, whether mentalizing impairments in PSD are state\nor trait features is still inconclusive. Although, generally, the data\nlend more support to a trait hypothesis, it is impossible to\nconfirm without longitudinal studies (Harrington et al. 2005b).\nThis is perhaps further evidence for the importance of negative\nsymptoms for ToM deficits in schizophrenia, given that negative\nsymptoms are a more stable feature of the illness than positive\nsymptoms, which vary over the course of the illness and with\ntreatment.\nTo conclude, we believe there is not a strong enough empirical\nplatform to assert impaired mentalizing, and especially hyper-\nmentalizing, as a phenotypic marker of PSD, which C&B\u2019s sub-\nsequent genetic imprinting theory requires. Evidence regarding\nmentalizing deficits being a state or trait marker of PSD is mixed,\nand it is equally unclear whether impaired task performance in\nPSD is caused by deficits in mentalizing or other cognitive pro-\nblems. We argue that autism and schizophrenia cannot easily\nbe conceptualized as polar opposites on a spectrum or continuum\nof mentalizing ability without changing the nature of this spec-\ntrum. However, with some modifications, C&B\u2019s theory lends\nitself readily to empirical testing and hence provides a valuable\nframework for future research.\nReunifying autism and early-onset\nschizophrenia in terms of social\ncommunication disorders\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004391\nSylvie Tordjman\nDepartment of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Rennes 1 and\nLaboratoire de Psychologie de la Perception, CNRS FRE 2929, University of\nParis 5, France.\ns.tordjman@ch-guillaumeregnier.fr\nAbstract: Autism and early-onset schizophrenia share common\ndimensions of social communication deficits. The possible role of\ncommon genetic factors has to be seriously considered, such as the\nserotonin transporter gene that influences the severity of social\ncommunication impairments (negative symptoms) and hallucinations\n(positive symptoms). Autism and the negative syndrome of\nschizophrenia might be at one extreme of a continuum, and paranoid\nschizophrenia (positive symptoms) at the other extreme.\nAutism and schizophrenia (more precisely, the negative syn-\ndrome of schizophrenia as observed in early-onset schizo-\nphrenia), far from being diametrical disorders of the social\nbrain as postulated by Crespi & Badcock (C&B), share\ncommon psychopathological dimensions in terms of social com-\nmunication deficits. This does not contradict C&B\u2019s hypothesis\nthat autism and schizophrenia (but the latter in its paranoid\nform) represent two extremes on a cognitive spectrum.\nHistorical diagnostic overlaps between autism and schizo-\nphrenia have existed since the appearance of autism in the nomen-\nclature of psychiatric disorders. Originally autistic disorder and\nschizophrenia were intimately linked. Indeed, the term autism is\nderived from the Greek autos, which means self and was intro-\nduced for the first time by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler\nin 1911 to describe social withdrawal in adults with schizophrenia.\nIn 1943, the American psychiatrist Leo Kanner borrowed from\nBleuler the term autism to define a syndrome observed in 11 child-\nren \u2013 which, at that time, was a part of the diagnostic category\n\u201cChildhood Schizophrenia.\u201d Since the early 1970s, autism and\nschizophrenia have belonged to two different diagnostic cat-\negories. However, they still share some common features: They\nare both considered as developmental psychiatric disorders invol-\nving psychotic symptoms with impairments in the same main\nbehavioral domains (especially in communication and social inter-\nactions). Communication impairments are reported in autistic dis-\norder as well as in early-onset schizophrenia (Alaghband-Rad et al.\n1995; Asarnow et al. 1994; Baum et al. 1995; Cantor et al. 1982).\nThus, impairments in verbal communication (delay in the develop-\nment of spoken language, poor or disorganized speech) and non-\nverbal communication (reduced facial expression or body\nlanguage; poor eye contact; and abnormal emotional expression\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n278 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nsuch as flat, bizarre, or inappropriate affects) are found in individ-\nuals with early-onset schizophrenia or autistic disorder. In\naddition, social development is impaired in both schizophrenia\nand autistic disorder. The degradation of social skills is a hallmark\nof schizophrenia (Mueser et al. 1991) and the distinguishing\nfeature of subgroups within schizophrenia (Carpenter et al.\n1988). Deterioration of social skills is associated with the chronic\nphase of schizophrenia and its deficit form (Carpenter et al.\n1988) or negative syndrome. Social isolation observed in schizo-\nphrenia, in particular in the childhood of individuals with early-\nonset schizophrenia, is similar to the autistic withdrawal described\nby Kanner (1943).\nTantam (1988) even argued that individuals with autistic dis-\norder display symptoms that can also be considered as schizoid\npersonality traits. More recently, Konstantareas and Hewitt\n(2001) reported that none of 14 men with paranoid schizophrenia\nmet criteria for autism, whereas 7 out of 14 males with autism\nmet criteria for schizophrenia on the Structured Clinical Inter-\nview (SCID). More precisely, symptom overlap concerned nega-\ntive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as affective flattening,\nalogia, avolition, apathy, anhedonia, and poor communication.\nThis symptom overlap can be observed in particular between\nhigh functioning autistic disorder or Asperger\u2019s syndrome and\nearly-onset schizophrenia, which tends to be characterized by\nnegative symptoms with social interaction impairments (Bailer\net al. 1996) and a chronic course (Krauss et al. 2000). Further-\nmore, retrospective studies conducted on patients with schizoph-\nrenia or longitudinal studies of children with autistic disorder\nreported frequent associations between these two disorders\n(antecedents of autistic disorder in the childhood of the schizo-\nphrenic group and appearance of schizophrenia in the autistic\ngroup) (Alaghband-Rad et al. 1995; Bender & Faetra 1972;\nJansen et al. 2000; Petty et al. 1984; Van Engeland & Van Der\nGaag 1994).\nFrom a biological point of view, abnormal stress responses (in\nparticular responses of the hypothalomo-pituitary-adrenal axis to\npsychosocial stress) are reported in schizophrenia (Jansen 1998;\nJansen et al. 2000) as well as in autistic disorder (for a review,\nsee Tordjman et al. 1997). This common biological feature is\nassociated in both disorders with major anguish focused often\non body image, difficulties to adapt to novel situations, and\nabnormal behavioral responses to environmental stimuli and\nstressful situations (Jacobson & Ackerman 1990; Tordjman\net al. 1997; Van Den Bosch et al. 1992; Wiedl 1992). Interest-\ningly, some studies suggest that the apparent pain insensitivity\nobserved in both autism and schizophrenia is more related to a\ndifferent mode of pain expression due to social communication\nimpairments and body image problems, than to a real endogen-\nous analgesia (Guieu et al. 1994; Tordjman et al. 1999; Watson\net al. 1979).\nFinally, genetic factors possibly involved in both early-onset\nschizophrenia and autistic disorder have been discussed by Yan\net al. (2000). The serotonin transporter gene (HTT) is of particular\ninterest given the reported association of a HTT promoter poly-\nmorphism with anxiety-related traits in the general population\n(Lesch et al. 1996). Furthermore, in a genetic study conducted\non families of 71 children with autism, we showed that the HTT\npromoter polymorphism modifies the behavioral phenotypic\nexpression of autism: the data consistently pointed to the short\n(s) allele being associated with the more severe impairments in\nthe communication and social interaction domains (Tordjman\net al. 2001). These data were confirmed by another study\n(Brune et al. 2006). Of special relevance are reports that the\nHTT promoter polymorphism also influences the severity of hallu-\ncinations in schizophrenia: Intensity of hallucinations was posi-\ntively associated with the long (l) allele (Malhotra et al. 1998)\nand negatively associated with the s allele (Golimbet et al. 2003).\nIt suggests that the HTT promoter polymorphism influences the\nphenotypic expression of positive symptoms (hallucinations) and\nnegative symptoms (social withdrawal and communication\ndeficits). In this regard, our results fit within C&B\u2019s hypothesis:\nAutism and the deficit form of schizophrenia (observed in particu-\nlar in early-onset schizophrenia) would be at one extreme (nega-\ntive symptoms), and paranoid schizophrenia at the other\nextreme (positive symptoms) of this continuum. It opens the\npath to future common research on the genetics of autism and\nschizophrenia, and underlines the importance of using a method-\nology in which genetic transmission is studied in concert with a\ndetailed examination of clinical phenotype.\nIn conclusion, I suggest that future research on the genetics of\nautism and schizophrenia should develop multi-trait models\n(Tordjman et al. 2007) and a multidimensional approach, such\nas studying social and communication impairments, instead of\nfocusing on diagnostic categories.\nPsychiatric disorders and the social brain:\nDistinguishing mentalizing and empathizing\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004408\nAlfonso Troisi\nDepartment of Neuroscience, University of Rome, Tor Vergata, 00161 Rome,\nItaly.\nalfonso.troisi@uniroma2.it\nAbstract: Social cognition is a broad term, incorporating all aspects of\nsocial functioning from perceiving emotional stimuli to attributional\nstyle and theory of mind. Not distinguishing between these different\ncapacities may confound the interpretation of the data deriving from\nstudies of the relationship between psychiatric disorders and the social\nbrain. The distinction between cognitive and affective components of\nsocial cognition is clearly exemplified by the abnormalities observed in\npsychopathy and Williams syndrome.\nTraditionally, assessment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders\nhave focused on affective, cognitive, and somatic symptoms.\nHowever, interpersonal problems and abnormal social behaviors\nare often the first indication than an individual is experiencing\nmental health difficulties. Recent advances in the field of social\nneuroscience have been instrumental in showing that abnorma-\nlities in social cognition are an important aspect of the clinical\nprofile of many psychiatric disorders, and that some interperso-\nnal problems associated with psychopathology are caused by dys-\nfunctions in the social brain (Bru\u00a8ne et al. 2003). In line with this\nnew approach to defining the clinical phenotypes of psychiatric\ndisorders, Crespi & Badcock (C&B) focus on social brain func-\ntioning in autism and psychosis. After reviewing an impressive\namount of clinical, behavioral, and neurological data, C&B con-\nclude that these two conditions represent opposites along a spec-\ntrum from underdeveloped to hyperdeveloped social cognition,\nwith normality at the center, and hypothesize that the develop-\nment of these disorders is mediated by genomic imprinting.\nWhereas it is undisputed that patients with autism display defi-\ncits in a wide range of social cognition tasks, the idea that psycho-\nsis (and schizophrenia in particular) is associated with a\nhyperdeveloped social brain is likely to leave many clinicians per-\nplexed. In fact, it seems to go against the prevailing consensus\nthat patients with schizophrenia show defective (rather than\nenhanced) abilities in the domain of social cognition (Burns\n2006b). However, before considering C&B\u2019s view of schizo-\nphrenia as heretical, we should pay attention to the methodologi-\ncal problems that complicate the study of social brain\ndysfunctions in psychiatric disorders.\nFirst, psychiatric diagnoses in general, and the diagnosis of\nschizophrenia in particular, lack validity. Patients with the same\ndiagnosis may have different diseases, and these different dis-\neases (or subsyndromes) may involve different abnormalities of\nthe social brain. For example, in the schizophrenia population,\nsocial cognition abilities seem to vary with the presence of\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 279\nviolent behavior (Abu-Akel & Abushua\u2019leh 2004), paranoid\nfeatures (Langdon et al. 2002), and negative symptoms (Cor-\ncoran & Frith 1996). Second, tasks designed for studying social\ncognition in psychiatric patients tend to have dubious ecological\nvalidity. For example, McCabe et al. (2004) showed that indivi-\nduals with schizophrenia demonstrate intact theory-of-mind abi-\nlities when tested in real life during conversational interactions.\nThird, the term \u201csocial cognition\u201d is a broad concept, incorporat-\ning all aspects of social functioning from perceiving social\nemotional stimuli to attributional style and theory of mind. Not\ndistinguishing between the different capacities that allow an indi-\nvidual to navigate the social environment may confound the\ninterpretation of the data deriving from studies of the relation-\nship between psychiatric disorders and the social brain. Here,\nI will focus in further detail on this last methodological problem.\nA promising approach to dissecting the various components of\nsocial cognition is to distinguish the capacity to represent other\npeople\u2019s intentions and beliefs (referred to as theory of mind or\nmentalizing) and the capacity to share the feelings of others\n(referred to as empathy) (Singer 2006). Although C&B do not\npay much attention to such a distinction in their target article,\nthere is preliminary evidence that the capacities to mentalize\nand to empathize are differentially impaired in schizophrenia.\nDiscussing these data, Shamay-Tsoory et al. (2007) have argued\nthat the conflicting evidence in the literature concerning schizo-\nphrenic patients\u2019 ability to perform on theory-of-mind tasks is\ndue to the dissociation between cognitive and affective com-\nponents of social cognition. According to these authors, such dis-\nsociation would also explain the puzzling finding that the\nschizophrenic population includes both individuals who \u201cunder-\nmentalize\u201d and individuals who \u201covermentalize\u201d (C. D. Frith\n2004). However, probably schizophrenia is not the best model\nto illustrate the necessity to distinguish between cognitive and\naffective components of social cognition. In this regard, psycho-\npathy and Williams syndrome are much better.\nPsychopathy is a pervasive pattern of disregard for the rights of\nothers associated with distinctive emotional and behavioral fea-\ntures. Individuals with this personality disorder are frequently\ndeceitful and manipulative in order to gain personal profit.\nEven though they may display a glib, superficial charm, these\npeople tend to be callous, cynical, and contemptuous of the feel-\nings, rights, and suffering of others. The emotional deficits associ-\nated with psychopathy interfere with the development of moral\nreasoning and put the individual at risk for developing high\nlevels of antisocial behavior. In other words, an absence of\nempathy is what characterizes psychopaths who hurt others\nwithout feeling guilt or remorse (Blair 2003). Interestingly, the\nempathic deficit is associated with no other deficit of social cog-\nnition. Persons with this disorder are capable of accurately asses-\nsing the costs and benefits of short-term social interactions,\naccurately reading others\u2019 behavior rules, utilizing self-monitor-\ning information to alter their strategies, and successfully disguis-\ning their intentions (Troisi 2005). Confirming this, experimental\nstudies have found no indications of impairment with theory of\nmind among individuals with a diagnosis of psychopathy\n(Richell et al. 2003).\nWilliams syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodevelopmental dis-\norder caused by hemizygous microdeletion of about 28 genes\non chromosome 7q11.23 and characterized by many cardiovascu-\nlar, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic problems. WS\nis associated with mild to moderate mental retardation and a\nunique combination of social-emotional and social-cognitive\nabnormalities. A striking feature of children with WS is their\nhigh sociability and empathy for others. Increased interest in\nsocial interaction is evident from infancy onwards, and fascina-\ntion with faces, positive interpersonal bias, and overfriendliness\nextend into adulthood. Intriguingly, this remarkable hypersocia-\nbility is coupled with a deficit in the ability to interpret people\u2019s\nbehavior in terms of their mental states. Therefore, despite their\nincreased empathy and social gregariousness, individuals with\nWS encounter problems in everyday interactions because of\ntheir inability to detect and understand others\u2019 beliefs and inten-\ntions (Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2006). In short, the social brain\ndysfunctions observed in psychopathy and WS appear to be dis-\ntinct and selective. Individuals with psychopathy show a pro-\nfound empathic dysfunction but no indications of impairment\nwith theory of mind. In contrast, individuals with WS show\nabnormally high levels of empathy combined with a defective\ntheory of mind.\nThe distinction between cognitive and affective components of\nsocial cognition exemplified by psychopathy andWSmay apply to\nother psychiatric disorders. Future studies in different diagnostic\ngroups will have to clarify when impaired abilities of mentalizing\n(understanding the propositional attitudes of others) and\nempathizing (sharing the affects of others) play unique roles\nand when they play common roles in causing social disability.\nThe relationship between psychiatric disorders and the social\nbrain is likely to be multiformed. In some psychiatric disorders,\nabnormalities in social cognition may be a vulnerability factor\nthat gets transformed into full-blown psychopathology in the\nface of significant stressors. In other disorders, the experience\nof psychiatric symptoms may produce temporary abnormalities\nin social cognition in individuals with effective and appropriate\ncapacities for navigating the social environment. Progress in\nthis area of research requires not only refining methods for asses-\nsing the various aspects of social cognition, but also developing\ntheoretical models for generating new explicative hypotheses.\nIn this regard, C&B\u2019s target article is an important contribution.\nPsychosis and autism as two developmental\nwindows on a disordered social brain\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X0800441X\nSophie van Rijn,a Hanna Swaab,a and Andre\u00b4 Alemanb\naDepartment of Clinical Child and Adolescent Studies, Centre for the Study of\nDevelopmental Disorders, Leiden University, 2333 AK Leiden, The\nNetherlands; bBCN Neuroimaging Center, University of Gro\u00a8ningen, 9713 AW\nGro\u00a8ningen, The Netherlands.\nsrijn@fsw.leidenuniv.nl\nhswaab@fsw.leidenuniv.nl\na.aleman@med.umcg.nl\nAbstract:With regard to social-cognitive deficits in autism and psychosis,\nCrespi & Badcock\u2019s (C&B\u2019s) theory does not incorporate the\ndevelopmental context of the disorders. We propose that there is\nsignificant overlap in social-cognitive impairments, but that the exact\nmanifestation of social-cognitive deficits is highly dependent on the\ndynamics of cognitive development and hence different in autism as\ncompared to psychosis.\nWe begin by stating that the theoretical framework of Crespi &\nBadcock (C&B) is an important contribution to the unraveling\nof the nature of disorders of the social brain. However, although\nit is not our intention to question the consensus that autism and\nschizophrenia are two different psychiatric disorders, we argue\nthat the described differences in brain functioning and cognition\nbetween autism and psychosis should be considered within a\ndevelopmental context. The comparison of social-cognitive dys-\nfunctions in autism and psychosis as C&B have presented,\nimplies in most cases a comparison of two different developmen-\ntal windows. Autism is by definition a childhood-onset disorder,\nwhereas psychosis is diagnosed primarily in (early) adulthood.\nThis may have important implications, as findings from develop-\nmental neuropsychology suggest that the same cognitive dysfunc-\ntions may present differently at different ages.\nFirst, depending on the maturation of the brain, specific cog-\nnitive functions become \u201con-line\u201d as development progresses.\nFor example, maturation of the frontal cortex continues into\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n280 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nearly adulthood, and executive functions will therefore be quan-\ntitatively and qualitatively different in early adulthood as com-\npared to childhood. Hence, certain cognitive impairments will\nbecome more salient as development progresses. Considering\nthis \u201cgrowing into deficit,\u201d a concept proposed by Rourke et al.\n(1983), the profile of cognitive impairments may change over\ntime in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder.\nHence, the pattern of behavioral difficulties may also change\nover time in some individuals possibly resulting in a shift in psy-\nchopathology. Recent reports suggest that shifts from the autism\nspectrum to the psychosis spectrum are mainly seen when con-\nsidering the broad autism spectrum, that is, children who have\nsevere social impairments but who may not meet full criteria\nfor the core autism phenotype. Mouridsen et al. (2008) have fol-\nlowed up 89 children with atypical autism, of which 30.4% devel-\noped a psychotic disorder in adulthood, whereas only 1.9% of the\n258 non-clinical controls did so. Second, Karmiloff-Smith (1997)\nhas stressed the importance of considering the interactive nature\nof cognitive impairments associated with neurodevelopmental\ndisorders. Thus, the neurodevelopmental origins of two distinct\nphenotypical outcomes, such as autism and psychosis, may\nshow similarities. However, the exact phenotypical outcome is\nshaped by interactions with other neurodevelopmental and\nenvironmental factors during development.\nAlthough autism and schizophrenia can quite reliably be sepa-\nrated as two distinct syndromes by DSM-IV or IDC-10 criteria, at\nthe level of individual symptoms some of the behavioral charac-\nteristics are observed in both disorders. This is not new, as\nBleuler (1911) already delineated \u201cautism\u201d as a cardinal feature\nof schizophrenia. C&B attribute this overlap to superficial beha-\nvioral similarities and argue that autistic features may also be\nexpressed in some negative schizophrenia symptoms. However,\nthere is also evidence for increased levels of paranoid traits in\nindividuals with Asperger\u2019s syndrome (Blackshaw et al. 2001;\nCraig et al. 2004), suggesting that behavioral overlap is not\nlimited to negative schizophrenia symptoms and extends to psy-\nchotic traits. Taking this together with the dynamics of cognitive\ndevelopment, we argue that although social-cognitive impair-\nments may seem different in (adults with) psychosis as compared\nto (children with) autism, this does not necessarily point to two\ndifferent or opposite social brain dysfunctions.\nIndeed, reports of similarities in social-cognitive performance\nin both disorders support this suggestion. Besides mentalizing\ndeficiencies in autism, a recent meta-analysis has pointed to defi-\ncits in theory of mind (ToM) in different subtypes of schizo-\nphrenia patients (Sprong et al. 2007). Not only the\nschizophrenia patients characterized by disorganized or negative\nsymptoms, but also those with predominantly persecutory delu-\nsions scored significantly lower in each study, on average 1.2 stan-\ndard deviations lower than non-clinical controls, in various tasks\nmeasuring mentalizing and ToM capacities. Moreover, in a study\nby Harrington and colleagues (Harrington et al. 2005a), the\nseverity of persecutory delusions in schizophrenia patients was\nrelated (r \u00bc 2.48) to more severely impaired mentalizing abili-\nties. Also, patients with paranoid delusions could not be discrimi-\nnated from individuals with Asperger syndrome on several tasks\nmeasuring ToM skills (Craig et al. 2004), as both groups per-\nformed comparably worse as compared to non-clinical controls.\nNot only in clinical populations, but also in the general popu-\nlation, \u201cpositive\u201d schizotypal traits (analogous to psychotic clinical\nsymptoms) seem to predict poorer mentalizing performance\n(Pickup 2006). One possible explanation for the relation\nbetween psychosis or paranoia and ToM impairments has been\nput forward by Bentall and Kinderman (1998). They propose\nthat the following two factors contribute to persecutory delu-\nsions: (1) an external attributional bias, and (2) an impairment\nin incorporating contextual information needed for making attri-\nbutions. An impaired ability to understand what other persons\nare thinking and feeling (ToM) represents one type of deficit in\ntaking into account important contextual information.\nInterestingly, similarities between the autism and psychotic\nspectrum have also been observed with regard to the neurobiolo-\ngical underpinnings of impaired theory of mind. When asking\nindividuals to judge faces with regard to trustworthiness, that\nis, attribute intentions to others, functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) shows very similar patterns of brain activation\nin individuals with an autism-spectrum disorder and paranoid\nschizophrenia patients (Pinkham et al. 2008).\nFinally, our studies on Klinefelter syndrome also suggest an\noverlap in social-cognitive dysfunctions associated with autistic\nand psychotic behavior. Men with Klinefelter syndrome display\nvarious social-cognitive deficits and have increased levels of\nboth autistic and psychotic traits (van Rijn et al. 2006a; 2006b;\n2007; in press).\nIn sum, we feel that C&B\u2019s comparison of the cognitive mech-\nanisms characteristic of the autism spectrum and psychotic spec-\ntrum should take into account the dynamics of cognitive\ndevelopment from childhood into adolescence and adulthood.\nAlso, the observations of similarities in social-cognitive dysfunc-\ntions in the autism and schizophrenia spectrum should not be\nignored. We hope to have provided convincing evidence\nshowing that mentalizing abilities, which are among the core\ndomains of cognitive functions that dissociate autism from psy-\nchosis according to C&B, are hypodeveloped in both the\nautism and psychotic spectrum. As also suggested by Pinkham\net al. (2008), social brain dysfunctions in the autism and psychotic\nspectrum may be deficit-specific, rather than disorder-specific.\nEvolutionary perspectives on psychoses and\nautism: Does genomic imprinting contribute\nto phenomenological antithesis?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004421\nGanesan Venkatasubramanian\nDepartment of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and\nNeurosciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, 560029, India.\nvenkat.nimhans@gmail.com\nhttp:\/\/venkat.nimhans.googlepages.com\/home\nAbstract: Crespi & Badcock (C&B) have presented a novel view that the\ninfluence of genomic imprinting causes diametrically opposite disorders:\nnamely, psychoses and autism. I propose an extended hypothesis that\nwhile genomic imprinting is likely to have an influence on the\npathogenesis of psychoses and autism, it might contribute to\nphenomenological antithesis between as well as within these disorders.\nCrespi & Badcock (C&B) have elegantly summarized the evi-\ndence for psychoses and autism to be considered as \u201cdiametrical\ndisorders of the social brain.\u201d Importantly, their work blends the\nconcept of differential evolutionary selection pressures on male\nand female brains (Lindenfors et al. 2007) with contemporary\nneurobiological observations. Although the authors have\ndescribed autism and psychoses as \u201cdiametrically opposite phe-\nnotypes\u201d (target article, Abstract), evidence from other studies\n(reviewed in this commentary) suggests that the relationship\nbetween them might be more complex.\nThis intriguing complexity is illustrated by the striking comor-\nbidity of \u201cseemingly incompatible\u201d syndromes (e.g., 34.8% of\nadults with atypical autism had schizophrenia spectrum disorders;\nMouridsen et al. 2008). Also, in the recently postulated \u201cnetwork\ndisease hypothesis,\u201d it was estimated that 20\u201360% of autism-pre-\ndisposing genetic polymorphisms also predispose the bearer to\nbipolar disorder, and 20\u201375% of these polymorphisms also predis-\npose the bearer to schizophrenia (Rzhetsky et al. 2007). Moreover,\nDISC1 gene, which was reported to co-segregate with schizo-\nphrenia (Mackie et al. 2007), is also associated with autism and\nAsperger\u2019s syndrome (Kilpinen et al. 2007).\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 281\nIn addition to these shared genetic diatheses, evidence for\npotentially similar pathogenesis for both autism and schizo-\nphrenia does exist (although the studies summarized in Table 1\nof the target article suggest contrasting pathogenetic mecha-\nnisms). Both autism and schizophrenia are associated with (1)\ndeficient insulin-like growth factor-1 (Riikonen et al. 2006; Ven-\nkatasubramanian et al. 2007), (2) masculinized digit ratio\n(Manning et al. 2001; Procopio et al. 2006), (3) smaller corpus\ncallosum (see Waiter et al. [2005] in relation to autism; see Ven-\nkatasubramanian et al. [2002] and Woodruff et al. [1995] in\nrelation to schizophrenia), and (4) increasing paternal age\n(Reichenberg et al. 2006; Sipos et al. 2004).\nThese shared genetic and pathogenetic abnormalities, as well\nas clinical comorbidity between psychoses and autism, suggest\nan extended hypothesis that, although genomic imprinting is\nlikely to have an influence on the pathogenesis of psychoses\nand autism, it might contribute to phenomenological antithesis\n(opposite symptomatic manifestations) between as well as\nwithin these disorders. This hypothesis derives indirect support\nfrom the recently emerging view that no unitary cause (genetic\nor cognitive) can explain the diverse symptoms of autism\n(Happe\u00b4 et al. 2006). Extending the thesis by Happe\u00b4 et al.\n(2006), I propose that at least three evolutionary significant\ndimensions \u2013 namely, systemizing ability, schizotypy, and affect\nregulation (with each dimension being independent and possibly\nhaving multiple components) \u2013 need careful consideration with\nrelevance to the impact of genomic imprinting on these dis-\norders. Interestingly, the prototypical disorders related to these\nthree dimensions (systemizing ability \u2013 autism; schizotypy \u2013 schi-\nzophrenia; affect regulation \u2013 bipolar disorder) are all influenced\nby genomic imprinting (Luedi et al. 2007).\nRecently, Luedi et al. (2007) have listed genes that have been\nproved or predicted with high confidence to be imprinted in loci\nlinked to these three disorders. The ratio of paternal to maternal\n(P:M) effects (parent-of-origin as well as paternal\/maternal\nexpression) of the proposed imprinted genes in these three dis-\norders are as follows: autism (P:M \u00bc 5 : 4), schizophrenia\n(P:M \u00bc 3 : 2), and bipolar disorder (P:M \u00bc 3 : 6) (Luedi et al.\n2007; supplemental research data online). These P:M ratios\nsuggest that the influence of genomic imprinting on these dis-\norders may not be exclusively paternal or maternal. The P:M pro-\nfiles of autism and schizophrenia suggest more of paternal than\nmaternal effects, whereas the P:M profile of bipolar disorder\nsuggests the reverse.\nBased on this, one might speculate that autism and bipolar dis-\norder are \u201cphenomenologically antithetical\u201d disorders (at either\nend of spectrum) with schizophrenia being \u201cin the middle.\u201d Inter-\nestingly, the multidimensional model of schizotypy (Kwapil et al.,\nin press) suggests that \u201cpositive schizotypy\u201d is related to psychotic-\nlike experiences and mood disorders (tending more towards bipo-\nlarity), whereas \u201cnegative schizotypy\u201d is related to negative and\nschizoid symptoms (tending more towards autism). Similar\ndescriptions for affective instability (Lara et al. 2006), as well as\nsystemizing ability (Baron-Cohen 2006), can explain the spectrum\nof symptoms within a specific dimension, as well as the paradoxical\ncoexistence of apparently \u201cpolar\u201d or phenomenologically antitheti-\ncal conditions.\nGenetic studies of these three hypothesized dimensions might\noffer valuable insights on the pathogenesis of these neuropsychia-\ntric disorders. Because autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar dis-\norder are affected by genomic imprinting (Luedi et al. 2007), it\nis plausible that the three hypothesized dimensions that are\nadversely affected in these disorders might also be influenced\nby imprinting. Indeed, the schizotypal dimension in schizo-\nphrenia and bipolar disorder has been reported to be associated\nwith homozygous high activity catechol-O-methyltransferase\n(COMT). Moreover, hypomethylation of membrane-bound\nCOMT promoter gene has been reported to be a potential\nmolecular basis for the shared symptoms of schizophrenia\nand bipolar disorder (Abdolmaleky et al. 2006). Significantly,\nmethylation-mediated processes constitute one of the important\nmechanisms for genomic imprinting (Reik & Walter 2001). This\nsuggests that schizotypy might be influenced by imprinting.\nImprinting is postulated to offer evolutionary adaptations\n(Wilkins & Haig 2003). Interestingly, these hypothesized dimen-\nsions are evolutionarily significant because a balanced mix of\nthese dimensions might offer survival advantages (James 2003;\nNettle & Clegg 2006), whereas an imbalance might lead to psy-\nchiatric disorders. An imbalanced imprinting polarized to one\nof these three dimensions might result in one disorder (e.g.,\nextreme schizotypy might result in schizophrenia), whereas an\nimbalanced imprinting adversely influencing more than one\ndimension might result in comorbidity of phenomenologically\nantithetical conditions. Also, the imprinting mechanisms influen-\ncing these hypothetical dimensions might be more intricate\nbecause of additional factors like \u201cleaky imprinting\u201d (which can\nresult in \u201cgain-of-function\u201d as well as disorder; Delong 2007),\nenvironmental influences (Jirtle & Skinner 2007), and interaction\nwith sex-related biological differences.\nTo summarize, Dobzhansky\u2019s statement that, \u201cNothing in\nbiology makes sense except in the light of evolution\u201d (Dobz-\nhansky 1973), emphasizes the need for evolutionarily informed\napproaches to understand diseases and disorders. However,\ncontemporary medicine focuses predominantly on \u201cproximal-\netiology\u201d whereas the \u201cdistal-etiology\u201d based evolutionary\napproach has mostly been neglected (Nesse et al. 2006). C&B\u2019s\ntarget article is an example for promising applications of evol-\nutionary approaches in understanding complex human diseases.\nAlthough the studies summarized by C&B strongly emphasize\nthe influence of genomic imprinting in psychoses and autism,\nadditional literature reviewed in this commentary illustrates the\ncomplexity of this influence; and I hypothesize that genomic\nimprinting contributes to phenomenological antithesis between\nas well as within these disorders.\nTowards a computational neuroscience of\nautism-psychosis spectrum disorders\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004433\nTony Vladusich\nDepartment of Cognitive and Neural Systems, and Center of Excellence for\nLearning in Education, Science and Technology, Boston University, Boston,\nMA 02215.\nthevlad@bu.edu\nAbstract: Crespi & Badcock (C&B) hypothesize that psychosis and\nautism represent opposite poles of human social cognition. I briefly\noutline how computational models of cognitive brain function may be\nused as a resource to further develop and experimentally test\nhypotheses concerning \u201cautism-psychosis spectrum disorders.\u201d1\nComputational neuroscience seeks to understand brain function\nthrough a combination of mathematical and experimental tech-\nniques. The computational neuroscience of mental disorders \u2013 a\nrelatively new field of research \u2013 may provide an avenue to\ndevelop and test the hypothesis of Crespi & Badcock (C&B)\nthat autism and psychosis represent opposite poles of human\nsocial cognition. Modifications to existing computational models\nof healthy brain function, in particular, may help to understand\nhow imbalances in neurotransmitter systems give rise to the\nbehavioral symptoms associated with autism and psychosis.\nI will discuss how a computational model of category learning\nand recognition has begun to inform research on both autism and\npsychosis (Grossberg 2000a; Grossberg & Seidman 2006). This\nmodel hypothesizes that humans recognize objects by matching\ntop-down expectations (subliminal primes or hypotheses) \u2013\nbased on learned categories \u2013 against bottom-up representations\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n282 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nof sensory features. According to the model, when there is a suf-\nficient match between top-down categories and bottom-up fea-\ntures, we recognize the observed object as belonging to the\nselected category. Modifications to the learned associations\nbetween features and category can take place at this juncture,\nthereby refining the category expectation. When there is a suffi-\nciently large mismatch between the categories and features, the\nbrain quickly and unconsciously searches through existing cat-\negory memories for a better-matching category. Should this\nsearch fail, the brain then learns a new category, associating\nthe existing cluster of sensory features with the active category.\nA model parameter called vigilance determines the amount of\nsimilarity required to define a match between categories and\nfeature clusters. If vigilance is high, a high degree of similarity\nbetween categories and features is required for recognition to\noccur, whereas the converse is true if vigilance is low.\nIt has been proposed that vigilance varies continuously in a\npopulation of individuals, and that autistic individuals may have\nan abnormally high vigilance level (Grossberg & Seidman\n2006). This abnormally high vigilance level ensures that autistic\nindividuals are inordinately influenced by bottom-up features.\nHigh vigilance leads to the formation of highly specific (concrete)\ncategories and prevents the learning of general (abstract) cate-\ngories. In terms of recognition performance, high vigilance\nmeans that autistic individuals require an above-average degree\nof similarity between categories and features to recognize an\nobject (Klinger & Dawson 2001; cf. Molesworth et al. 2005). It\nalso implies that such individuals often fail to recognize objects,\nsuch as faces, due to trivial variations in sensory features, such\nas changes in hair-style. On the flip side, high vigilance ensures\nthat autistic individuals very seldom mistakenly recognize an\nobject as belonging to a category to which it does not belong:\nHigh vigilance will lead to the formation of new categories for\nalmost any cluster of features. Such abnormalities in category\nlearning may secondarily affect related brain regions involved\nin conditioning, motivation, cognition, and motor control (Gross-\nberg & Seidman 2006). Thus, according to this modeling frame-\nwork, many autistic symptoms may arise from abnormalities in\nbrain systems governing basic learning, attention, expectation,\nand recognition.\nThe top-down pathways involved in category learning and rec-\nognition usually act as subliminal priming signals. This means\nthat top-down signals do not normally activate neurons encoding\nsensory features, preventing us from experiencing hallucinations\nduring daily life. It has been proposed (Grossberg 2000a),\nhowever, that humans are able to volitionally (willfully) modulate\nthe influence of top-down signals, allowing these signals to\nbecome suprathreshold. Such suprathreshold top-down activation\nin the absence of actual sensory features is hypothesized to occur\nduring normal imagery, such as inner speech. During psychotic\nepisodes, according to this theory (Grossberg 2000a), top-down\nsignals become suprathreshold due to the loss of volitional modu-\nlatory control, leading to hallucinations \u2013 a hypothesis for which\nthere exists some empirical support (Aleman et al. 2003). The\nsame modeling framework which helps to explain aspects of\nautism, is therefore able to account for features of psychosis.\nCan the autistic and psychotic features in the above compu-\ntational framework be considered opposite poles of a spectrum?\nProbably not, strictly speaking. The high vigilance associated with\nhyperspecific category formation in autism is in some ways\northogonal to the loss of volitional control of top-down signals\nin psychosis. It remains theoretically possible, for example, for\na person to have both high vigilance and impoverished volitional\ncontrol. Yet the pertinent issue is whether or not the underlying\ngenetic variation across individuals supports such phenotypes.\nOne recent study examining speech discrimination in schizo-\nphrenia (Vercammen et al., in press) suggests that hallucinations\nmay actually be associated with lower-than-normal vigilance\nlevels, supporting the diametrical hypothesis of C&B, at least\nwith respect to vigilance control. Detailed computational\nmodeling of the autistic-psychotic spectrum, should it exist,\nmay help to clarify the relationship between parameters under-\nlying the brain\u2019s computational machinery and the genetic\nfactors underlying the development of phenotypic variations in\nhuman cognition and behavior.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank Stephen Grossberg for useful comments on an earlier version of\nthe commentary.

Consistent with C&B\u2019s\nframework, some evidence (substantial heritability, assortative mating,\nsex-specific familial transmission) points to possible sex chromosome\nand imprinted genes effects on 2D:4D expression.\nCrespi & Badcock (C&B) are to be congratulated for an out-\nstanding theoretical contribution that may constitute a break-\nthrough regarding our understanding of autism-spectrum\nversus schizophrenic-spectrum disorders. Although their\napproach is theoretically guided, it is also data driven. That is,\nalthough supposed imprinted genes accounting for these dis-\norders have yet to be pinpointed, C&B amass a large body of evi-\ndence (see their target article\u2019s Table 1) showing that the\ndisorder phenotypes are diametrically opposed. Therefore, it is\nlegitimate and important to criticize and refute, or to augment\nand supplement, any constituents of their evidence put forward.\nInter alia, C&B review some digit ratio (2D:4D) research find-\nings consistent with their proposition (see sect. 7 on \u201cSex differ-\nences\u201d). No less than four references (Arato\u00b4 et al. 2004; Manning\net al. 2001; Milne et al. 2006; Walder et al. 2006a) from this brief\npassage are listed under their key references, so this clearly has\nrelevance. In what follows, I augment and supplement further\nevidence from 2D:4D research consistent with the C&B\nhypothesis.\n2D:4D is the length ratio of the second digit (index finger, 2D)\nto the fourth digit (ring finger, 4D). This trait is sexually differen-\ntiated (men have lower 2D:4D than women) and may be a\nmarker for the organizational (permanent) effects of prenatal\nandrogen action (Manning et al. 1998). C&B have missed some\nimportant further 2D:4D research references. This is fully excu-\nsable, but the gaps in the cited literature should be filled. As of\nthis writing (early 2008), the 2D:4D literature numbers about\n230 journal publications and about 50 unpublished theses, and\nis therefore overviewed only by specialists. Owing to the fast\nresearch progress, complete and topical reviews of 2D:4D\nresearch are currently unavailable (for partial reviews, see\nCommentary\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 283\nCohen-Bendahan et al. 2005; Manning 2002; Peters et al. 2002;\nPutz et al. 2004; Voracek & Dressler 2007; Voracek & Offenmu\u00a8l-\nler 2007; Voracek & Pavlovic 2007; Voracek et al. 2006; 2007).\nTen studies (C&B cite two: Manning et al. 2001; Milne et al.\n2006) are informative for 2D:4D in autism-spectrum disorders.\nManning et al. (2001) found that children with autism or high-\nfunctioning autism (Asperger syndrome) and their first-degree\nrelatives (unaffected siblings, mothers, and fathers), had mark-\nedly lower (hypermasculinized) 2D:4D than healthy population\ncontrols. This basic finding replicated in a study of autistic\npatients from Japan (Osawa et al. 2005), was also replicated by\nMilne et al. (2006) and de Bruin et al. (2006) for boys with\nautism, but only partially replicated by Falter et al. (in press)\nfor boys with autism, who had somewhat, but not significantly,\nlower 2D:4D than normals. Knickmeyer et al. (2006) mention\ndata indicating that girls with autism as well show masculinized\n(low) 2D:4D. Relatedly, three further papers have reported\nassociations of low 2D:4D with various attention-deficit\/hyperac-\ntivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes in children (Martel et al., in\npress; McFadden et al. 2005; Stevenson et al. 2007). Of further\nnote, Voracek and Dressler (2006) have found no correlation of\n2D:4D with autistic-like personality traits and other relevant\ndimensions (empathizing and systemizing) in a large healthy\ngeneral population sample.\nFive studies (C&B cite two: Arato\u00b4 et al. 2004; Walder et al.\n2006a) are informative for 2D:4D in schizophrenic-spectrum dis-\norders. Arato\u00b4 et al. (2004) focused on distal finger-extent patterns\n(2D and 4D, both relative to 3D) rather than on 2D:4D and\nascertained a smaller distance from 2D tip to 3D tip and a\nlarger distance from 4D tip to 3D tip (i.e., relatively longer 2D\nand relatively shorter 4D, both broadly equivalent to a high,\nfeminized 2D:4D) in both male and female schizophrenic\npatients, compared with normals. Walder et al. (2006a), using a\nsimilar method, reported feminized distal finger extent in male\n(but not female) adolescents with schizotypal personality dis-\norders, compared with healthy controls. The results of another\nstudy (Procopio et al. 2006) are difficult to interpret, as an\nuncommon measure (height [h] divided through 2D or 4D)\nwas used, which evidently was confounded by patient-control\ndifferences in height. Female (but not male) schizophrenic\npatients had significantly higher h:2D than controls. Wei\u00dfegger\n(2004) found markedly higher 2D:4D in female schizophrenic\npatients than in controls. However, the effect was, due to\nsample size limitations, statistically not significant, though notice-\nably smaller in males; and a follow-up study (Baumhackl 2007)\nfailed to replicate any 2D:4D differences between schizophrenic\npatients and normals.\nOn the whole, the literature suggests 2D:4D to be low (mascu-\nlinized) autism-spectrum disorders and high (feminized) in\nschizophrenic-spectrum disorders. An earlier conjecture\n(Manning 2002, p. 143), namely that 2D:4D in schizophrenia,\nas in autism, could be low (male-typed), appears untenable.\nThe evidence is not without inconsistencies and replication fail-\nures, and appears stronger and more unequivocal for autism-\nspectrum than for schizophrenic-spectrum disorders. Whereas\nassociations of 2D:4D and autistic-like traits apparently do not\ngeneralize to the normal population (Voracek & Dressler\n2006), it remains to be seen whether associations of 2D:4D and\nschizotypal traits do. Additional 2D:4D data pertaining to both\nautism and schizophrenia would certainly benefit tests of the\nC&B hypothesis.\nAlso worth consideration is the substantial heritability\n(h2 \u00bc .60 to .80) of 2D:4D (twin studies: Gobrogge et al. 2008;\nPaul et al. 2006; Voracek & Dressler 2007; family studies: Dress-\nler et al. 2004; Marshall 2000; Ramesh &Murty 1977), along with\nevidence for assortative mating on the trait (spousal correlations:\nabout r \u00bc .20; Voracek et al. 2007). Further, 2D:4D is a correlate\nof androgen sensitivity, as shown through correlations with func-\ntional polymorphisms of the androgen receptor gene, located on\nthe X chromosome, in men (Manning et al. 2003). Surprisingly,\n2D:4D family studies findings seem more consistent with\nhypothetical Y-linked inheritance (i.e., strong father-son and\nbrother-brother correlations) than with X-linked inheritance,\nbut identification of Y-linked inheritance is known to be elusive.\nAll of this points to possible direct sex chromosome and imprinted\ngene effects on 2D:4D expression. If so, this in turn would give\nclearer support of the C&B hypothesis, as far as 2D:4D is\nconcerned. It may also shed more light on further intriguing\ndifferences (e.g., age of onset, sex ratio of prevalence) between\nautism-spectrum and schizophrenic-spectrum disorders.\nAuthors\u2019 Response\nThe evolutionary social brain: From genes to\npsychiatric conditions\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X08004457\nBernard Crespia and Christopher Badcockb\naDepartment of Biosciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6,\nCanada; bDepartment of Sociology, London School of Economics, London\nWC2A 2AE, United Kingdom.\ncrespi@sfu.ca\nC.Badcock@lse.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/biology\/faculty\/crespi\/\nhttp:\/\/www.lse.ac.uk\/collections\/sociology\/whoswho\/badcock.htm\nAbstract: The commentaries on our target article, \u201cPsychosis\nand Autism as Diametrical Disorders of the Social Brain,\u201d\nreflect the multidisciplinary yet highly fragmented state of\ncurrent studies of human social cognition. Progress in our\nunderstanding of the human social brain must come from\nstudies that integrate across diverse analytic levels, using\nconceptual frameworks grounded in evolutionary biology.\nWe thank the commentators for providing insightful and\nconstructive input on our target article, and for pointing\nout topics that will benefit from additional discussion. Our\nresponse is structured along the same general lines as the\ntarget article, scaffolding up from genes to cognition, beha-\nvior, and psychiatric conditions of the social brain. We first\nclarify some key aspects of the genetic and epigenetic bases\nof our theory, by describing the patterns and processes of\ngenomic imprinting in more detail (sect. R1), and by\nshowing how not just human imprinting-related syndromes,\nbut also neurogenetic syndromes mediated by losses versus\ngains of suites of non-imprinted genes, contribute to dia-\nmetric autistic versus psychotic phenotypes (sect. R2).\nNext, we show how phenotypes associated with growth\nand mentalistic or mechanistic skills can serve to connect\ngenes and development with cognition and behavior (sect.\nR3), and we address the core issue of cognitive and beha-\nvioral similarities (sect. R4) and differences (sect. R5)\nbetween psychotic- and autistic-spectrum conditions. We\nfocus, as did many of the commentators, on the degree to\nwhich these conditions can be considered as opposite \u2013\nquite literally, opposing in their developmental bases and\ndiametric in their cognitive phenotypes, reflecting biases\ntowards mentalism or mechanistic thought. Finally, we\nexplain in greater detail how imprinting effects are expected\nto interact with sex differences, in generating the consider-\nable diversity of autistic-spectrum and psychotic-spectrum\nconditions that we observe in nature (sect. R6), and\nprovide closing thoughts (sect. R7).\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n284 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nR1. Mechanics of genomic imprinting\nR1.1. Theory\nWe are grateful to David Haig for providing detailed dis-\ncussion of how natural selection is expected to drive the\nevolution of imprinting effects on phenotypes, given the\ndiversity of fitness-mediating interactions between\nvarious asymmetric kin. We have focused on mother\u2013\nchild interactions, both physiological and behavioral,\nbecause these represent the best understood, and most\nclearly expected, selective arena for genomic conflicts\nunderlain by imprinting.\nR1.2. Number and action of imprinted genes\nThe efficacy of Haigian imprinted gene effects on develop-\nment, brain, and behavior is to some degree a function of\nthe numbers of imprinted genes in humans (Keller) and\nhow they may be subject to dysregulation (Davies &\nIsles). The OTAGO database of imprinted genes (Glaser\net al. 2006) lists 63 confirmed imprinted genes in\nhumans plus 41 genes that are imprinted in mice with\nno data as yet from humans, and bioinformatic predictions\nfrom Luedi et al. (2007) suggest the presence of an\nadditional 156 human-imprinted genes. These known or\npredicted imprinted genes are primarily protein-coding.\nRecent studies of small non-coding RNAs have also pro-\nvided evidence for about 200 imprinted RNA genes in\nhumans, many of them brain-specific in expression and\nsome known to mediate neurodevelopmental disorders\n(Fiore et al., in press; Mattick & Makunin 2006; Royo\net al. 2006). Thus far, the identification and characteriz-\nation of imprinted genes in humans has been a haphazard\naffair, but new genomic technologies (Gimelbrant et al.\n2007) should provide us with a complete list within\nseveral years. Each and every brain-imprinted gene on\nthis list should, in our view, be immediately suspected of\nengagement in genomic conflicts. Such conflicts will be\nexpressed in neurocognitive development to the extent\nthat an imprinted gene has successfully shifted the\nbalance of genetic power in its own paternally biased or\nmaternally biased interests, or is dysregulated via altera-\ntions to imprints or the machinery of imprint application,\nmaintenance, or removal, in addition to alteration by\nmechanisms common to all genes, such as point mutations\nand forms of epigenetic modification independent of\nimprinting effects. This is all that we mean by dysregulated\nin \u201cmore ways\u201d than non-imprinted genes (Davies & Isles);\nnone of the molecular mechanisms involved are known to\nbe unique to imprinting, but there is a greater overall\nscope for alteration, and greater effects because such\ngenes are effectively haploid.\nGiven the central role of a small number of imprinted\ngenes, such as CDKN1C, in orchestrating placental devel-\nopment (Andrews et al. 2007), and their coordinated\nexpression in complex networks of imprinted and non-\nimprinted genes that jointly regulate development (Var-\nrault et al. 2006), the actual number of imprinted genes\nis much less relevant than their \u201cextended genotypes,\u201d\nwhereby imprinted genes regulate the expression of\nother genes. For example, the imprinted non-coding\nRNA miR-134 regulates LIMK1, a focal gene in the etiol-\nogy of Williams syndrome (Ja\u00a8rvinen-Pasley et al. 2008),\nand imprinted-gene effects appear to be pervasive in key\nnetworks underlying development (Smits & Kelsey 2006).\nR1.3. Roles of imprinted and non-imprinted genes\nHow important are imprinted genes in neurodevelopmen-\ntal disorders, compared to non-imprinted genes\n(Deutsch, Ludwig, & McIlvane [Deutsch et al.],\nDickins, Dickins, & Dickins [Dickins et al.], Fitzger-\nald & Hawi, Keller)? We reiterate that autistic- and psy-\nchotic-spectrum conditions are each highly heterogeneous\nin their etiologies, though convergent in core phenotypes,\nand that our hypothesis posits a phenotypic diametricity\nfor these conditions that is underlain in part by the\ngenomic diametricity of imprinting. In addition to the\ngenetic evidence discussed in our target article, we also\nnote that: (1) autism induced by uncontrolled PKU\ndeficiency (Dennis et al. 1999) may be mediated by\nstrong overexpression of the paternally expressed\nimprinted gene NNAT (Surendran et al. 2005); (2) over-\ngrowth and autism caused by NF1 gene alterations may\nbe driven by a paternal-allele-specific interaction with\nthe imprinted IGF2-H19 locus (Ling et al. 2006); and\n(3) recent evidence implicates dysregulated processing of\nnon-coding RNAs (which may include imprinted RNAs)\nin Fragile X syndrome (Plante et al. 2006), as also\nsuggested by studies of the Prader-Willi phenotype\nfound at low frequency in patients with the Fragile\nX full mutation but no epigenetic modifications to chromo-\nsome 15 (Nowicki et al. 2007). All of these cases require\nfurther study, but taken together with the evidence\ndescribed further on in this response and in our target\narticle, they indicate that alterations to imprinting rep-\nresent a pervasive, convergent cause of many manifes-\ntations of autism, though not an exclusive one (Happe\u00b4\net al. 2006). We are aware of no alternative genetically\nbased theory that can at least potentially account for\nsuch a broad and deep range of evidence or for such other-\nwise-inexplicable etiologic heterogeneity.\nOf course, many non-imprinted genes have been linked\nwith autism, as well as with schizophrenia, in genome\nscans and association studies \u2013 each with small effects\non risk that have been difficult to replicate among\nstudies (e.g., Craddock et al. 2005). Imprinted genes are\nnecessarily embedded in physiological and developmental\nnetworks, so such important contributions to neurodeve-\nlopmental disorders from non-imprinted genes are, as\nnoted by Keller and described in Keller and Miller\n(2006), by no means unexpected. But consider the relative\nstrength of imprinted-gene effects, in each case for one or\nseveral genes: (1) the risk of psychosis rises to near 100%\nin Prader-Willi syndrome due to maternal uniparental\ndisomy, which involves combined loss of paternal-gene\nexpression and increased maternal-gene expression (Soni\net al. 2008); (2) loss of function of the paternally expressed\nSGCE gene leads to high rates of psychotic and depressive\nsymptoms (Lauterbach et al. 1994; Yokoi et al. 2006); and\n(3) loss or reduction of functional gene product of the\nmaternally expressed UBE3A gene causes Angelman syn-\ndrome and is also associated with Rett syndrome, with\nboth syndromes involving very high rates of autism and\nstriking phenotypic overlap for diverse traits (Jedele\n2007); UBE3A has also been implicated in idiopathic\nautism (Samaco et al. 2005). Similar considerations apply\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 285\nto the gene MeCP2 that directly underlies Rett syndrome:\nit exhibits allelic variants linked with idiopathic autism\n(Shibayama et al. 2004), and its functions include inter-\naction with imprinted genes (Nomura et al. 2008).\nAs noted by Haig and Davies & Isles, maternal dupli-\ncations of the 15q11-q13 region have also been associated\nwith autism; however, genotype-phenotype correlations\nare extremely variable for cytogenetic alterations of this\nregion (here, interstitial duplications and supernumerary\nduplicated-chromosome fragments, referred to as idic15)\n(Cohen et al. 2007; Kwasnicka-Crawford et al. 2007). For\nexample, Prader-Willi phenotypes have been found in indi-\nviduals with paternally inherited interstitial duplications of\n15q11-q13 (Engelen et al. 1999; Mao et al. 2000), and\nsupernumerary-chromosome cases, all of which are mater-\nnally derived, involve severe developmental delay and phe-\nnotypes that have been characterized as \u201catypical\u201d autism\n(Cohen et al. 2007; Cook et al. 1997). Studies analyzing\ngene expression and effects from all candidate genes in\nthis region, which include GABRB3 (Dykens et al. 2004)\nand the FMRP-interacting gene CYFIP1 (Nishimura\net al. 2007b; Nowicki et al. 2007) as well as UBE3A\n(which shows increased expression in idic15 cell lines;\nBaron et al. 2006), are required for robust interpretation\nof these alterations, given the complexity of the genetic\nand epigenetic regulatory networks involved (e.g.,\nLanders et al. 2005). By contrast, Angelman syndrome\nhas a simple, well-documented cause: reduced expression\nor activity of the maternally expressed gene UBE3A.\nOur hypothesis can also not be evaluated directly from\ninformation on the expected or observed parental\nexpression patterns of specific imprinted genes associated\nwith autistic- or psychotic-spectrum conditions (Venkata-\nsubramanian), because we require information on the\ndirection of change in gene-expression levels or gene-\nproduct activity. For example, allelic variation in several\ngenes, including DISC1 (Chubb et al. 2008; Kilpinen\net al. 2008), CNTNAP2 (Arking et al. 2008; Friedman\net al. 2008), UBE3A (Nurmi et al. 2003; Sporn et al.\n2004b), RELN (Serajee et al. 2006; Shifman et al. 2008)\nand HLA-DRB1 (Torres et al. 2002; Wright et al. 2001),\nhas been associated with both autism and schizophrenia;\ndo these genes exhibit diametric alterations or expression\npatterns in the two conditions, in some cases mediated\nby imprinting? UBE3A is known to be imprinted,\nDISC1 is not imprinted despite a bioinformatic prediction\n(Hayesmoore et al., in press; Luedi et al. 2007), and\nCNTNAP2 and RELN show parent-of-origin effects in\ntheir associations with autism (Arking et al. 2008; Dutta\net al. 2007; Rampersaud et al. 2007). Tordjman describes\nsalient evidence from the SLC6A4 gene, of alternative\nalleles associated with more-impaired sociality in autism\nversus severity of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia,\nthat provides a clear example of the types of genetic data\nmost useful in evaluating our hypothesis.\nTaken together, these studies indicate that dysregula-\ntion of imprinted genes exerts strong, penetrant effects\non the expression of autistic- and psychotic-spectrum con-\nditions that are generally in the directions predicted by our\nhypothesis. Linkage-scan and genetic-association studies\nusually do not test for parent-of-origin effects, or quantify\nepigenetic variation, so the degree to which such major\neffects are paralleled by smaller, much more numerous\ninfluences, remains unexplored.\nR2. Genomic copy-number variation and diametric\nsyndromes\nOur hypothesis is more general than imprinted gene\neffects, in postulating the evolution of human neurocogni-\ntive architecture along a major axis from mechanistic to\nmentalistic cognition, manifested in psychiatric pathology\nby autistic and psychotic spectrum conditions. Such archi-\ntecture is expected to canalize genotype\u2013phenotype\nassociations for diverse forms of genetic, epigenetic, and\ngenomic variation. Burne, Eyles, & McGrath (Burne\net al.), Deutsch et al., and Keller draw attention to\ngene copy number variation as a recently characterized\nsource of human genomic variability, one that provides\nopportunities for novel tests of our hypothesis.\nR2.1. Copy number variation in neurogenetic\nsyndromes\nThe best-known cases of copy-number variation to date\ninvolve neurogenetic syndromes caused by deletions\nversus duplications of autosomal, non-imprinted regions\nharboring multiple genes, or deletions versus duplications\nof the entire X chromosome itself. For autosomes, del-\netions cause haploidy for genes in the region, whereas\nduplications result in triploidy. Do these diametric\ngenomic alterations result in diametric neurocognitive\nphenotypes, in particular autistic- versus psychotic-spec-\ntrum phenotypes? We have summarized salient, available\ninformation for three of the best-understood pairs of auto-\nsomal neurogenetic syndromes in Table R1. In each of\nthese three cases, one of the syndromes is notably associ-\nated with psychotic spectrum diagnoses and behavior (as\nalso summarized, e.g., by Table 2 in Gothelf [2007]),\nwhile its sister syndrome (Crespi, in review) is associated\nwith autistic-spectrum diagnoses and behavior. We also\nhighlight the observation that the three conditions con-\nsidered here as falling into the psychotic spectrum,\nSmith-Magenis syndrome, Williams syndrome, and velo-\ncardiofacial syndrome, are each characterized by higher\nverbal than visual-spatial skills, and by undergrowth, as\nalso reported for Prader-Willi syndrome disomy (Dykens\n2002; Roof et al. 2000; Whittington & Holland 2004);\nsimilar considerations apply to schizotypy and psychosis,\nas documented in our target article. These findings\nprovide notable support for a psychotic-autistic neuroge-\nnetic continuum underlying human cognition, a spectrum\nthat should also be genetically mediated by myriad other,\nsmaller-scale cases of copy-number variation throughout\nthe human genome.\nNeurogenetic conditions caused by \u201ccopy-number\u201d\nvariation of whole sex chromosomes require special con-\nsideration, because as Haig (2006) explains, genes on the\nX chromosome are expected to favor maternal interests\nand thus resemble maternally expressed imprinted genes\nin the nature of their predicted effects on development.\nAs a result, by our hypothesis, Klinefelter syndrome\n(usually 47,XXY) should involve high rates of psychotic\nspectrum disorders, whereas Turner syndrome (usually\n45,X) should involve a higher incidence of autism. As\nalso noted in our target article and shown in Table R1,\nthis prediction is met (Boks et al. 2007a; DeLisi et al.\n2005; Skuse 2000; 2005). Based on these considerations,\nwe also make the a priori prediction of high rates of\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n286 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nTable R1.

Fragile X syndrome also, of\ncourse, involves loss of function for a key X-linked gene,\nas well as overgrowth and high rates of autism.\nR2.2. Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes\nAngelman and Prader-Willi syndromes are, like Beckwith-\nWiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes, \u201csister syn-\ndromes\u201d mediated by diametric alterations to imprinted\nregions, in the same general way that the sister syndromes\ndescribed earlier are mediated by diametric alterations to\ngene copy number for a genomic region. The main differ-\nence is that for imprinted regions, gene expression can be\ndoubled or lost for the affected regions, as opposed to\nalterations to a haploid or triploid state for autosomal\nnon-imprinted genes. Both forms of variation are the\nclosest we will ever achieve to human equivalents of\nmouse models (such as gene knockouts), which have pro-\nvided many key insights into developmental mechanisms,\nas described by Burne et al.\nSeveral commentators have raised Angelman and\nPrader-Willi syndromes to rather exalted status in the expo-\nsition and support of our theory, calling them a \u201ccorner-\nstone\u201d (Davies & Isles), \u201ccentral dogma\u201d (Fitzgerald &\nHawi), or \u201cconceptual core\u201d (Dickins et al.). We consider\nthem not nearly so central or crucial, but Prader-Willi syn-\ndrome in particular has provided us with clear insights into\nlinkages among imprinted genes, neurological function,\nbehavior, and psychiatric disorders (Haig & Wharton\n2003; Crespi, under revision). For example, Prader-Willi\nsyndrome teaches us about howmultiple genetic and epige-\nnetic causes can generate the same or a very similar pheno-\ntype: Hence, this syndrome (or most of its major features)\nhas been associated with a large suite of different indepen-\ndent genetic and epigenetic causes, many of which are\nknown or believed to involve imprinted genes, hypothala-\nmus dysfunction, or both (Crespi, under revision). Now\nimagine such Prader-Willi genetic deviations and pheno-\ntypes on a much smaller scale, and bereft of pathology: a\nsmall, complacent baby with gentle suck and little cry, chan-\nging upon weaning to a relatively independent child who\nseeks his or her own food (Haig & Wharton 2003), and\nperhaps also engages in other maternally undemanding\npursuits, such as jigsaw puzzles (Dykens 2002). We have\nposited a smooth genetic and phenotypic continuum\nbetween an easy child physiologically and socially and, in\nextrema, a child who, like one with Prader-Willi syndrome,\nmatures to face psychosis and depression. Ultimately, as\nHaig suggests, the genes will decide \u2013 especially, we\nmight add, genes expressed in the brains of fetuses and\nyoung children.\nR3. Integrative analyses of neurodevelopmental\ndisorders\nThe diversity of approaches represented by the various\ncommentators is truly impressive, and it demonstrates\nthe utility of, for example, evolutionary theory (Haig),\ncomputational biology (Vladusich), animal genetics and\nphysiology (Burne et al., Davies & Isles), linguistics\n(Frawley), neuroscience (Oberman & Pascual-\nLeone), psychology (Kanazawa, Langdon & Brock,\nNettle, Thakkar, Matthews, & Park [Thakkar et al.],\nTroisi), and clinical psychiatry (Behrendt, Goos) in\nunderstanding human neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe cost of such disciplinary specialization, of course, is\nblindness to the whole conceptual and empirical elephant,\nan elephant that must be constructed in toto by stitching\nparts together to see how well they fit.\nThese disciplines can be synthesized using the concep-\ntual tools of endophenotypes, intermediate phenotypes,\nand behavioral phenotypes (Cannon & Keller 2006; Fein-\nstein & Singh 2007; Meyer-Lindenberg & Weinberger\n2006), whereby traits or mechanisms characteristic of a\ngiven psychiatric condition serve as guides for analyses\ndownwards to genes and upwards to cognition and beha-\nvior. Goos encourages an increased focus on endopheno-\ntypes involving social skills to evaluate imprinting\neffects \u2013 we concur, but note that mother\u2013offspring inter-\nactions involve much more than social skills per se; indeed,\nhyperactivity and disrupted sleep impact upon mothers of\nchildren with Angelman syndrome (Barry et al. 2005), and\nmost actions of infants and children, social or not, are\nlikely to affect levels of cost imposed on mothers. To evalu-\nate social and nonsocial interactions, and their psychologi-\ncal mechanisms, Troisi stresses the ecological validity of\nthe tests involved; we agree, citing mechanistic gaze-fol-\nlowing skills of autistics, which can be mistakenly inter-\npreted as mentalistic, as a possible example (Langdon\n& Brock) (e.g., Nation & Penny 2008; Senju et al. 2004;\nsee also Chiu et al. 2008). The key \u201cecology\u201d here for\nimprinted genes is costs and benefits to mother and to\nchild, which have yet to serve as a focal criterion for psy-\nchiatric-behavioral research.\nIn this analytic context, we reiterate that our hypothesis\npredicts alterations in physiology and behavior that are\nalways adaptive (to either mother or offspring) only for\nsmall deviations in development, cognitive architecture,\nand behavior \u2013 the larger the deviation, the harder it\nbecomes to separate adaptation from pathology. The con-\ntinuum from dynamic balance, to one-sided adaptations,\nand then to pathology in either direction, is illustrated\nin different ways in Figures 3, 4, and 5 of the target\narticle, which may help to address the concerns of\nLangdon & Brock and Thakkar et al. regarding the\npredicted mentalistic abilities of schizophrenics,\ndescribed in more detail later in section R6.2 on hyper-\nmentalism. This continuum extends to the molecular\nlevel \u2013 for example, the unexpected association between\nin utero growth restriction and paternal over-expression\n(due to duplication) at 6q24 (Temple & Shield 2002) high-\nlighted by Dickins et al. is likely a pathological effect\n(Temple, personal communication); the mouse model\nfor this situation, a knockout of the paternally expressed,\nimprinted Zac1 gene, shows the pattern of growth restric-\ntion predicted by the conflict theory (Varrault et al. 2006).\nSeparating adaptation from pathology in this context, and\nmaking robust falsifiable predictions, requires sufficient\nknowledge of molecular-developmental mechanisms. As\nfor skepticism regarding the conflict theory itself\n(Dickins et al.), we refer readers to Table 1 of Fowden\net al. (2006), which nicely summarizes support in\nthe only context analyzed comprehensively to date,\nplacentation.\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n288 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nDoes our hypothesis provide insights into specific, core\nphenotypes characteristic of autistic and psychotic spec-\ntrum conditions, bearing in mind that the heterogeneity\nin each spectrum may preclude universal generalizations\n(Davies & Isles, Deutsch et al.) and that mentalizing\nfunctions exhibit considerable diversity (Goos, Langdon\n& Brock, Troisi)? Psychotic spectrum conditions appear\nto almost universally involve better verbal skills than\nvisual-spatial skills, and indeed this imbalance has been\nsuggested as an endophenotype for schizophrenia (Kravar-\niti et al. 2006). The only obvious exception of which we are\naware is Klinefelter syndrome (Table R1), which is unique\nin involving X-chromosome imbalance. In keeping with\nthis pattern, we predict better verbal than visual-spatial\nskills in bipolar disorder and major depression, as evi-\ndenced by the literary and artistic prowess of some individ-\nuals with these conditions described further on, but\napparently not yet tested with robust psychological tools.\nSome verbal skills can be mechanistic, as seen in Asper-\nger\u2019s syndrome and autistic hyperlexia, but to the extent\nthat social verbal abilities form a core of mentalistic cogni-\ntion, this pattern fits well with an autistic-psychotic\ncontinuum.\nThe primary phenotype common to autistic-spectrum\nconditions is more or less temporary childhood over-\ngrowth for metrics of body size, head size, or both, being\nfound in idiopathic autism (Hobbs et al. 2007; Mraz\net al. 2007; van Daalen et al. 2007; Webb et al. 2007;\nXiong et al., in press; and citations in target article), and\nin the autistic conditions Fragile X syndrome (Chiu et al.\n2007; Terracciano et al. 2005), PTEN mutations (Butler\net al. 2005), RNF135 mutations (Douglas et al. 2007),\nand 22q13 deletion syndrome (Bonaglia et al. 2006).\nSotos and Weaver overgrowth syndromes also show\nnotable evidence of autistic behavioral phenotypes (de\nBoer et al. 2006; Derry et al. 1999; Mouridsen &\nHansen 2002; Rio et al. 2003; Sarimski 2003; but see\nalso Compton et al. 2004), and tuberous sclerosis may\nalso involve macrocephaly (Fidler et al. 2000). The main\nexceptions here are Angelman and Rett syndromes,\nalthough a mouse model of Angelman syndrome shows\nsome evidence of general overgrowth (Johnstone et al.\n2006). The perceptual, developmental, and computational\nperspectives of Belmonte, Oberman & Pascual-Leone,\nvan Rijn, Swaab, & Aleman (van Rijn et al.), and Vla-\ndusich provide insights into potential links between early\nbrain or general overgrowth, increased local to global pro-\ncessing (or increased bottom-up compared to top-down\nprocessing), and autistic cognition. The links of over-\ngrowth to a paternal bias in imprinted gene expression\nhave been amply demonstrated in mouse models, and in\nsome human genomic conditions such as Beckwith-Wie-\ndemann syndrome, which has \u2013 since after completion\nof our target article \u2013 also been demonstrated to involve\nan elevated incidence of autism (Kent et al., in press).\nOur theory is perhaps least developed thus far in\ndrawing connections between mechanistic versus menta-\nlistic cognition and phenotypes, such as growth and beha-\nvior, that impose more rather than fewer costs on the\nmother. For example, as described by Dickins et al.,\nGoos, and Troisi, selfish behavior can be mentalistic or\nmechanistic, perhaps associated in psychopathy with\nquite different sources of social isolation and deficits in\nempathy. A role for imprinting effects in selfish, egocentric\nbehavior per se should be restricted to mother\u2013offspring\ninteractions (or other classes of asymmetric relative,\nthough less clearly; see Haig) \u2013 but once such a brain\ndevelops in childhood, as in Asperger syndrome, it\ncannot be expected to change fundamentally with increas-\ning age. The clearest connections between mechanistic\ncognition and selfishness may be tendencies in autism to\ntreat people as \u201cthings,\u201d and to develop nonsocial skills\nin science and engineering (Badcock 2008; Wheelwright\n& Baron-Cohen 2001). But are healthy children who are\n\u201ceasy\u201d on mother also more mentalistic? Nettle\u2019s hypoth-\nesis that more mentalistic mates may, like a Williams-syn-\ndrome child, be more empathic, sensitive, and solicitous to\none\u2019s wants and needs may translate into a mother\u2013off-\nspring context, although we still expect parent-offspring\nconflicts mediated by non-imprinted genes.\nR4. Similarities between autistic- and psychotic-\nspectrum conditions\nOur exposition of autistic- and psychotic-spectrum con-\nditions as diametric has raised the issue of their apparent\nsimilarities, a topic that traces back to Bleuler\u2019s coinage\nof \u201cautism\u201d as a facet of schizophrenia. Thus, Burne\net al. note that paternal age and prenatal infections influ-\nence both autism and schizophrenia risk; Davies & Isles\ndescribe how attention and inhibitory processes are dys-\nfunctional in both sets of conditions; and Venkatasubra-\nmanian references papers on similarities between autism\nand schizophrenia in IGF-1 levels, digit ratios, and corpus\ncallosum size. Aside from phenotypes involving physiologi-\ncal and morphological traits, which must be decided based\non weight and quality of all the evidence (as we have\nattempted, and as Voracek kindly provides for digit\nratios), evaluation of similarities must focus on whether\nthey are only apparent, or, instead, reflect underlying simi-\nlarities in etiology that stretch from genes to neurodeve-\nlopment and cognition.\nR4.1. Paternal age\nPaternal-age effects on autism and schizophrenia risk have\nindeed been well documented (Cantor et al. 2007;\nLaursen et al. 2007), and diverse evidence suggests that\ndysregulation of imprinted genes, which results in either\na maternal or paternal expression bias, may mediate\nsuch links (Crespi 2006; Perrin et al. 2007; Reichenberg\net al. 2006). Direct tests, involving quantification of how\ngenomic, genetic, and epigenetic changes increase with\nage in sperm cells, are required to evaluate this matter\nfurther.\nR4.2. Infection and intrauterine growth\nThe influences of prenatal maternal infection on brain\ndevelopment, and risk of schizophrenia or autism (Burne\net al.), are strongly affected by the timing of infection\nduring pregnancy (Mednick et al. 1994; Meyer et al.\n2007). Based on these data, we expect that differences in\nthe timing of prenatal infection, for the same infectious\nagent, should differentially affect the risk of autism and\nschizophrenia; for example, first-trimester infections may\npredispose to autism, while the same infection in the\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 289\nsecond trimester may increase schizophrenia risk (Fatemi\net al. 2008). Prenatal resource deprivation should, given\nour expectation of overgrowth in autism and undergrowth\nin schizophrenia, also differentially lead to increases in the\nlatter condition. For example, a study of 2 million Swedish\nchildren born between 1963 and 1983 revealed a significant\nlink between schizophrenia and poverty in childhood. Those\nwith four out of five measured indicators of hardship had an\nalmost threefold greater risk of schizophrenia than those\nwith none (Wicks et al. 2005). Clearly, such findings would\nfit our paradigm of psychosis being a possible consequence\nof restricted growth and would predict that such develop-\nmental insults would not be found to predispose towards\nautism. Oberman & Pascual-Leone suggest a role for a\ndifferent form of environmental effect in autism: recent\nincreases in sensory stimulation during childhood \u2013 might\nsecular trends of increasing infant birth weight, due to\nhigher nutrient levels, likewise be involved in recent appar-\nent increases in rates of autism?\nOur interpretation of psychosis being a consequence of\nenhanced maternal rather than paternal brain function\nwould also fit the suggestion that schizophrenia may some-\ntimes be caused by infection with the protozoan parasite\nToxoplasma gondii (Webster 2007; Webster et al. 2006;\nYolken & Torrey 2008). People infected with T. gondii\n(between 15% and 80%, depending on the population)\nare three times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia\nthan those not infected, and so too are cat-owners. The sig-\nnificance of the latter may lie in the fact that the parasite\ncan only complete the reproductive phase of its life-cycle\ninside a cat. It achieves this by causing its principal car-\nriers, rats and mice, to lose their fear of cats, and so be\nmuch more likely to be eaten by one. Inside the rodent\u2019s\nbrain, the parasite attacks the amygdala, which plays the\nsame role in triggering fear reactions that it does in\nhumans. But when infected rats are treated with anti-psy-\nchotic drugs like those given to human schizophrenics, the\nrats\u2019 fear of felines returns. Men with Toxoplasma infection\ntend to be more reckless than normal, and infected people\nof both sexes are almost three times more likely to be\ninvolved in car accidents, and have measurably slowed\nreaction times (Ginsburg 2004; Randerson 2002). The\nfinding that in mice paternally expressed imprinted\ngenes are differentially expressed in limbic system com-\nponents like the amygdala and hypothalamus (Coan\net al. 2005; Keverne et al. 1996) combined with the suspi-\ncions about T. gondii and schizophrenia in humans,\nsuggests the intriguing possibility that an explanation\nmay lie in the parasite suppressing paternal brain\nsystems like the amygdala to produce an overall prepon-\nderance of maternal brain function, which we have\nargued could be a fundamental basis of psychosis in\ngeneral and of schizophrenia in particular. Similar con-\nsiderations may apply to cytomegalovirus, which has\nbeen reported to differentially affect the limbic system in\nhumans (Yolken & Torrey 2008).\nR4.3. Cognitive traits\nCognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric similarities between\nautism and schizophrenia, such as attentional and inhibi-\ntory traits (Davies & Isles) but especially negative\nsymptom schizophrenia (Thakkar et al., Tordjman,\nvan Rijn et al.) are, we believe, apparent and superficial\nrather than indicative of any common underlying\ngenomic and neurodevelopmental etiologies. Virtually all\nof these latter similarities are based on behavioral and\npsychological data, and we challenge critics to find any\nclear neurodevelopmental evidence connecting these\ntwo conditions. As described by Tordjman, all of the\ntraits most characteristic of negative symptom schizo-\nphrenia, \u201csuch as affective flattening, alogia, avolition,\napathy, anhedonia, and poor communication,\u201d involve\nabsences of traits that can be attributed to pathology,\nwhich cannot be taken as strong evidence of common\netiology. As regards the causes of apparent similarities, Ja\u00a8r-\nvinen-Pasley et al. (2008) cogently remark that \u201cequivalent\nbehavioral scores may mask distinctly different cognitive\nprocesses,\u201d and Skuse (2007) contends, with regard to\nautism, that \u201cin the absence of independent evidence of\naetiology, symptomatic phenotypes reflect primarily the\ncharacteristics of the instrument used to measure them.\u201d\nThakkar et al. in particular motivate us to further discus-\nsion of negative symptom schizophrenia, in addition to\nour model for its presence as a pathological effect of\nhighly dysregulated neurodevelopment (Fig. 6), mediated\nin part by imprinting. This model is supported, for\nexample, by associations between the presence and sever-\nity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia and increased\nloss of gray or white matter (especially in the prefrontal\nand temporal lobes; e.g., Sanfilipo et al. 2000; Turetsky\net al. 1995; Wible et al. 2001), in striking contrast to\ngreater retention of gray matter with age in Asperger syn-\ndrome, compared to controls (McAlonan et al. 2002).\nFrawley describes an instructive case of how functionally\nsimilar deficits (here, in private speech development) can\narise from fundamentally different mechanisms in autism\nand schizophrenia. We expect that analogous studies will\nsuccessfully fractionate other superficially similar dysfunc-\ntions of the social brain into autistic versus psychotic\netiologies.\nKlinefelter, Prader-Willi, and velocardiofacial syn-\ndromes exhibit clear biological links with schizophrenia\nand other psychotic-spectrum conditions but essentially\nno biological links with autism. Nevertheless, this suite\nof neurogenetic conditions has been considered to\nbelong to the autism spectrum (or at least to comprise\nautistic symptoms) as a direct consequence of interpreting\nnegative symptom schizophrenia and autism as closely\nrelated conditions. We consider this perspective to set psy-\nchiatry back intellectually nearly one hundred years to the\ndays of Bleuler, and to deny Kanner\u2019s and Asperger\u2019s revo-\nlutionary insights into autism as a condition fundamentally\nseparate from schizophrenia.\nPerspectives and research programs based on identify-\ning and characterizing specific deficits provide a limited\nconceptual framework, as do psychological theories of\nautism or schizophrenia (e.g., Behrendt); what we ulti-\nmately need are ways to connect across levels, from\ngenes to neurodevelopment, morphology, physiology, psy-\nchology and cognition.\nR5. Differences between autistic- and psychotic-\nspectrum conditions\nFitzgerald & Hawi are correct in saying that another\narticle could be written on the similarities between what\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n290 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nwe are calling autistic- and psychotic-spectrum disorders,\nand we would be happy to write a commentary on such\nan article. But just as the similarities between males and\nfemales can hardly be expected to reveal the important\nbiological fundamentals of sex differences, so such an\narticle would not reveal the underlying mechanisms\nwhich, in our view, explain the essential differences\nbetween these disorders. Our commentators have\ntouched upon a suite of such developmental, cognitive,\nbehavioral, and epidemiological differences that uncover\nnew diametric patterns salient to our hypotheses and\nprovide novel insights into the causes of autistic- and psy-\nchotic-spectrum disorders.\nR5.1. Age of onset\nThe concepts of hypo- and hyper-mentalism facilitate\nunderstanding of the general issue raised by Behrendt\nand van Rijn et al., that classical autism is a disorder\nwith invariable onset in childhood, whereas schizophrenia\nis very much a late adolescent- or adult-onset one (with the\nchildhood-onset schizophrenia mentioned by Tordjman\nbeing very rare, and even then appearing later than\nautism; Frith 1992; Jacobsen & Rapoport 1998). The\nreason could simply be that no one could develop the\ncharacteristic hyper-mentalism of psychosis without first\ndeveloping a more normal level of mentalism \u2013 evidently\nsomething which usually takes the whole of childhood\nand the greater part of adolescence to achieve. It has\nalready been suggested that schizophrenics may have an\nintact ability to mentalize right up to their first breakdown\n(Frith 1992), and Langdon has pointed out that if children\nwho later develop schizophrenia had failed to acquire a\nnormal theory of mind, they would have come to the atten-\ntion of clinicians long before the onset of their illness\n(Langdon 2005). Clearly, this is predictable if schizo-\nphrenic symptoms represent pathological extensions of\nmentalism far beyond the normal range. But if autistics\nare symptomatically hypo-mentalistic, this would imply\nthat they had never completed the normal process of\nmental development, but stopped short long before at\nsome point in childhood (or perhaps regressed back to\nit). In any event, autistic symptoms would show in child-\nhood, and psychotic ones would not be seen fully devel-\noped until later \u2013 which is exactly what we normally find.\nR5.2. Fertility\nNo one has questioned our expectation of lower fertility of\nparents with relatively autistic children, but Keller has\nrequested additional exposition on data regarding fertility\nin schizophrenics and their first-order relatives. The\nprimary upshot of this short review of evidence is that\ntwo studies demonstrate statistically significant higher fer-\ntility of sisters of schizophrenics, with one of these studies\nshowing such an effect only for schizotypal sisters (Bassett\net al. 1996; Haukka et al. 2003). As we and Keller also\nnote, other studies show a mix of lower or equal fertility\nof sibs, and equal or higher fertility for parents, which\nmay be attributed to either the effects that we posit, or,\nas we describe, to environmental consequences of\nsibship size. Combined, average brother-sister fertility\n(Haukka et al. 2003) is irrelevant, as are any other specific,\nabsolute measures, because such studies provide only\ncross-sectional data broadly suggestive of long-term evo-\nlutionary processes (Crespi 2006). Additional demo-\ngraphic studies of fertility in sibs, parents, and offspring\nof schizophrenics that control for environmental effects\nare certainly required for robust tests, but we suggest\nthat Type I error is unlikely to afflict two independent\nstudies, both providing data that fit closely with our\nmodel of sex and fertility effects in psychotic-spectrum\nconditions. With regard to predictions from Kanazawa\nof offspring sex ratios produced by individuals on the autis-\ntic and psychotic spectra, we would be concerned about\neffects from stoppage on the autistic side biasing the\ndata, as well as the converse \u2013 the bearing of daughters\nleading to increased family size, given their apparent\nlower costs of rearing (Rickard et al. 2007).\nWhat is perhaps most interesting about the demo-\ngraphic data just mentioned is that, combined with data\non lower birth weight and growth in schizophrenia, they\ndovetail so nicely with Nettle\u2019s hypothesis of female\nmate choice for \u201chealthy\u201d schizotypy. Thus, under both\nparent-offspring conflict theory and the conflict theory of\nimprinting, mothers (and maternal genes) are selected\nfor the bearing of smaller, less-demanding offspring,\nwhich permits higher fertility. As Nettle suggests, there\nmay be selection for females to choose mates on the\nbasis of such traits in children \u2013 and for higher fertility.\nThis hypothesis is speculative, but its components are fal-\nsifiable, and it gains plausibility from the strength of selec-\ntion on mate choice and on maternal-offspring\ninteractions.\nR5.4. Inner and private speech\nFrawley describes a striking new example of apparent dia-\nmetric differences between autism and schizophrenia: by\nhis hypothesis, inner speech stays inner in autism, and\nprivate speech is underdeveloped; whereas in psychosis,\nprivate speech becomes hyper-developed into elaborate\nsocial themes involving auditory hallucinations. Jones\nand Fernyhough (2007) point out that auditory hallucina-\ntions in schizophrenia exhibit precisely the same manifes-\ntations as private speech in typically developing young\nchildren, thus providing a clear explanation, convergent\nwith ours, for their social-developmental forms and con-\ntents. These considerations of inner and private speech\nhighlight the role of Vygotsky as an intellectual father of\nthe social brain hypothesis, and indeed of parent-offspring\nconflicts (Crespi, in press a); for example, Bentall (2003a,\np. 196) paraphrased Vygotsky (1962) in noting that:\nDuring this stage [of early childhood], the child and adult are\nconstantly issuing instructions or asking questions of each\nother so that, for the child, the whole process of speaking\nbecomes bound up with attempts by the two parties to\ncontrol each other\u2019s actions.\nCrespi (2007) describes recent evidence that genes under-\nlying the development of speech, as a sociality-manipula-\ntive organ of the social brain, may also be subject to\neffects from imprinting.\nR5.5. Religion\nWe endorse Kanazawa\u2019s remarks about religion here and\nin other works (Badcock 2004; 2008; in preparation), and\nhe points out an obvious but counterintuitive prediction\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 291\nimplied by the contention that autistic pathology is diame-\ntrically opposed to hyper-mentalism. This is that autistics\nought to be much less religiously, magically, and supersti-\ntiously minded than normal. Although few studies have\nbeen done, what is known about autistics\u2019 attitude to reli-\ngion bears out this expectation. For example, in their\nanalysis of the legal proceedings which provide much of\nthe evidence for their retrospective diagnosis of Hugh\nBlair of Borgue (1708\/9\u201365) as an autistic, Houston and\nFrith comment that:\nIt follows that a lack of theory of mind restricts a religious sense\n. . . for this reason the question posed by the judges: \u201cDid\nHugh Blair have a sense of God?\u201d can be interpreted as analo-\ngous to the question posed by modern psychologists: \u201cDid\nHugh Blair have a theory of mind?\u201d (Houston & Frith 2000,\npp. 164\u201365)\nThese authors point out that the final verdict of the court\nimplies that the judges did not believe that Hugh had the\nsame sense of God as other members of the community,\nand they conclude that this matches their interpretation\nof Hugh having a diminished awareness of mental states\nOne of the very few studies that has considered the evi-\ndence for religious feelings in autistics concludes that reli-\ngion in autism is entirely different from that in normal\nexperience (Bering 2002). Because autistics have difficulty\ninterpreting the meaning attached to social behavior and\ntherefore probably cannot rely on a theory of mind to\nexplain their experiences, their religious beliefs cannot\nattach to core representations of mental agency. The reli-\ngious beliefs of people with autism could therefore be seen\nas sliding into conceptual slots provided by what we would\ntermmechanistic cognition \u2013 even those, such as concepts\nof supernatural agents, that are traditionally relegated to\nwhat we would call mentalism. Consequently, superna-\ntural agents such as God are perceived as behavioral\nrather than intentional agents (Bering 2002). For\nexample, an account of the religious belief of one high-\nfunctioning autistic observes that the person concerned,\n\u201cSimply could not cope with spirituality when it was\nseen as the collective considerations of others. . . .\n[O]wing to the specific nature of his cognitive and\nemotional impairments he had found it very difficult to\nengage either in the theological or the philosophical\ndebate that occurred in the traditional construction of reli-\ngious practice\u201d (Isanon 2001, p. 75). Again, a mother of\ntwo autistic sons remarks that her boys \u201cdon\u2019t turn to\nGod as a way of navigating life\u2019s difficulties,\u201d adding that\nwhen one of them \u201cwas (inappropriately) attending a\nmainstream primary school, his report simply said, \u2018Reli-\ngious Knowledge: not applicable\u2019\u201d (Moore 2004).\nAccording to our view, superstition is another\nexpression of hyper-mentalism. But the fact that no less\nan anti-mentalist than B. F. Skinner once published a\npaper entitled, \u201c\u2018Superstition\u2019 in the pigeon\u201d (Skinner\n1948), suggests that we might distinguish between super-\nstitious behavior \u2013 which, if found in a pigeon could cer-\ntainly be expected in autistics \u2013 and superstitious belief,\nwhich is what we would expect in more mentalistically\nminded people. Although no studies of autistic supersti-\ntion have been done to our knowledge, our theory makes\na clear prediction: As in the case of religion, autistics\nshould show mainly superstitious behavior, with little or\nno mentalistic elaboration like that typically seen in articu-\nlate psychotics (Badcock, in preparation). Indeed, this\nmight answer Fitzgerald & Hawi\u2019s observation that indi-\nviduals with high-functioning autism may show fixed and\nrigid beliefs reminiscent of delusions observed in psycho-\nsis. Clearly, the typical autistic tendency to stubbornly\nfocus on narrow interests, to resist change, and to be\nimpervious to criticism could explain the superficial simi-\nlarity of such delusions to those of psychotics; but, to the\nextent that those delusions were superstitious in content,\nwe would expect them to be more pigeon-like than para-\nnoid in any true sense. No matter what the content,\nhowever, our theory predicts that the delusions of autistics\nshould be much less mentalistically elaborated than those\nof psychotics.\nFinally, we wholly concur with Kanazawa\u2019s point about\nwomen and religion, and would only add that the same is\ntrue of magical and superstitious thinking. For example,\nwomen usually show stronger belief than men in extra-\nsensory perception (especially telepathy and precognition)\nand in superstition (specifically, in astrology, ghosts,\npsychic healing, and reincarnation) (Irwin 1993). Self-\ntranscendence is one well-validated personality measure\nof mystical tendencies on which women have been\nfound to score 18% higher than men (Hamer 2004,\np. 36), and many other measures show a comparable sex\ndifference in attitudes towards the supernatural. In the\nwords of Nick Humphrey, the explanation may be that\n\u201cit is women who arguably have the greater sensitivity to\nhuman personal relationships\u2014and who, as every contem-\nporary survey shows, tend to be surest that the scientific\npicture of the world is incomplete\u201d (Humphrey 1996,\np. 51). If we add that science is incomplete because it is\nnotably hypo-mentalistic \u2013 and even anti-mentalis-\ntic \u2013 we can begin to see why the alternative to the\nmechanistic, scientific view of reality should so often be\nseen as the mentalistic, and indeed, hyper-mentalistic\none enshrined in magic, superstition, and religion\n(Badcock 2004; in preparation).\nR5.6. Savantism and extraordinary skills\nMuch the same point as made for religion in the preceding\nsection might answer Nettle\u2019s question about why what\nwe term mentalistic, rather than mechanistic, skills are\nattractive to women. Notwithstanding the ingenious sug-\ngestion he derives from our theory, it might simply be\nthat mentalistic excellence is inherently more appealing\nto the more mentalistic sex. But however that may be,\nboth Nettle\u2019s and Fitzgerald & Hawi\u2019s comments raise\nan issue about creativity to which we would like to\nsuggest a new kind of answer, based on our concept of a\nmentalistic continuum running from autism to psychosis.\nThis is the suggestion that, if there are autistic savants \u2013 as\nthere indeed are (Hermelin 2001; Treffert 2000) \u2013 then\nthere also might be psychotic savants.\nAutistic savantism is characterized by outstanding, if iso-\nlated, mechanistic skills or expertise set against a back-\nground of general mentalistic deficits. Accordingly, we\nmight predict that psychotic savantism should show the\nexact opposite cognitive configuration: remarkable, if\nperhaps highly circumscribed, mentalistic talents coexist-\ning with more general mechanistic deficits. By this term\nwe do not mean to suggest that the savants in question\nare in fact psychotic, only that their cognitive configuration\nputs them on the psychotic side of the mentalistic\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n292 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nspectrum. Nevertheless, the symmetry cannot be exact.\nFor a start, the normally sad plight of autistics reminds\nus that mentalistic deficits are typically much more signifi-\ncant socially and have an enormous impact on people\u2019s\npersonal relationships in a way in which mechanistic defi-\ncits seldom if ever do. Not being able to program the\nvideo, change a plug, or read a map is one thing, but\nfailing to understand other people\u2019s motives, actions, and\nintentions is quite another \u2013 and much more damaging\nfrom a social point of view. Hyper-mentalistic tendencies\nof the kind seen in psychotic savants might normally\npromote a person\u2019s social adjustment because of the skill\nthese consummate mentalists have in manipulating\nothers and exploiting them thanks to their natural\nempathic understanding \u2013 particularly of other people\u2019s\nweaknesses. Consequently, psychotic savants are likely to\nbe identified at worst as cranks or charlatans rather than\npsychopaths, and at best we should not expect psychotic\nsavants to be as noticeable as autistic ones usually are, or\nas readily diagnosed as such.\nAgain, the areas of expertise involved in psychotic\nsavantism might not be so obviously striking as calendar-\ncalculation, photographic memory, or computer-like\nmaths skills are. By contrast, hyper-mentalistic savantism\nmight be expected in skills and areas of expertise that\nare much closer to normal social life and everyday con-\ncerns. Examples might be outstanding achievement in reli-\ngious and political evangelism; literary and theatrical\nculture; litigation and the law; hypnosis, faith-healing,\nand psychotherapy; fashion, advertising, and public\nrelations; and commerce, confidence-trickery, and fraud\nof all kinds.\nWhere literature is concerned, female poets have been\nas notable as female writers of detective fiction (see our\nreply to Thakkar et al. further on), thanks perhaps to\nthe verbal, metaphorical, and abstract nature of the\nwritten word. Moreover, and as Fitzgerald & Hawi\nhint in their general comment about bipolar illness,\nthere is now good evidence that many of the world\u2019s\nleading poets of both sexes have shown signs of psycho-\ntic-spectrum disorders, most notably manic-depressive ill-\nnesses. A study of all major British and Irish poets born\nbetween 1705 and 1805 found a strikingly high rate of\nmood disorders, suicide, and institutionalization within\nthis group of writers and their families (Jamison 1993),\nand Nettle (2006) reported that poets and artists have\n\u201clevels of unusual experiences that are higher than con-\ntrols, and as high as schizophrenia patients\u201d (p. 876). As\nnoted by Jamison (1993), \u201cmanic-depressive illness,\nunlike schizophrenia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, is not a\ndementing illness. It may on occasion result in episodes\nof acute psychosis and flagrant irrationality, but these\nbouts of madness are almost always temporary and\nseldom progress to chronic insanity\u201d (Jamison 1993,\np. 96). Consequently, as in the perhaps parallel but men-\ntalistically opposite case of Asperger\u2019s savants (Fitzgerald\n2005), psychotic savants with a manic-depressive cognitive\nconfiguration may be sufficiently normal most of the time\nto be able to realize the advantages of their extended\nmentalism without being too disabled by it (e.g., Claridge\net al. 1990). Indeed, even some features associated with\nthe manic side of bipolar disorder, such as outgoingness,\nincreased energy, intensified sexuality, increased risk-\ntaking, persuasiveness, self-confidence, and heightened\nproductivity might contribute to success in many walks\nof life as long as they were not taken to extremes\n(Jamison 1993, p. 87). Even depressive episodes may con-\ntribute in view of the finding that mildly depressed people\nmay be more realistic and objective than non-depressed\nones (Taylor & Brown 1988). This might explain why\nthree quarters of studies report a link between manic-\ndepressive illness and the professional or upper classes\nacross several cultures and in different historical periods\n(Jamison 1993, p. 86). If autistic tendencies have contrib-\nuted to mathematics, science, and technology, mentalistic\nones have also clearly done so as far as literature, art, reli-\ngion, and society are concerned.\nThakkar et al. also ask, \u201cis there room for Sherlock\nHolmes in C&B\u2019s spectrum?\u201d Indeed there is, but an\neven more telling question might be whether there is\nalso a place for Miss Marple. A number of authors have\nalready noted Holmes\u2019s autistic traits and the critical role\nthey play in his success as a detective (U. Frith 2003;\nRennison 2005, p. 10). Indeed, Fitzgerald has described\nhim as one of the most notable fictional portrayals of an\nAsperger\u2019s savant (Fitzgerald 2005, p. 85). However, it\nhas been pointed out that Miss Marple, another of the\nimmortals of detective fiction, \u201cis in every way the oppo-\nsite\u201d of Holmes or Agatha Christie\u2019s other famous creation,\nHercule Poirot, \u201cand has no autistic traits at all: she solves\ncrimes by intuition, immersing herself in the context\nwithout analytic deduction\u201d (U. Frith 2003, p. 24). Could\nthis be because Miss Marple is female, and therefore\nlikely to be of a more mentalistic turn of mind, as\ndescribed in our reply to Kanazawa? If so, then both\nmentalistic and hyper-mentalistic aspects can be found\nfused with autistic ones in what is perhaps the most dis-\ntinctive literary genre of modern times: the detective\nstory. This apparent pattern may explain why thrillers\nare so endlessly fascinating and why detective fiction has\nemerged as such a major factor in modern literature.\nCould it be that, rather than adopt a safe, central,\nnormal mix of mentalistic and mechanistic cognition com-\nparable to that found in most people, detective stories\nbalance hyper-mentalistic paranoid suspicion against\nhypo-mentalistic autistic obsession, with conflicting\ndetail to get the best of both? At the very least, this\nwould explain why autistic characters like Sherlock\nHolmes and highly mentalistic ones like Miss Marple\ncould both make convincing fictional detectives \u2013 and\nwhy so many female writers have made a success of their\ndetective fiction (Badcock, in preparation).\nR6. Mentalistic and mechanistic cognition\nR6.1. Sources of mentalistic deficits\nLangdon & Brock touch on the issue of mentalistic def-\nicits in psychosis and rightly point out that \u201cit all\ndepends on what one means by mentalizing.\u201d In reply,\nwe might add that Troisi\u2019s comments on psychopathy\nand Williams syndrome highlight the contrast with\nBaron-Cohen\u2019s alternative concept of empathizing,\nwhich Troisi notes did not receive much attention in\nour original article but which Belmonte sees as\nextended and supplanted by our concept of mentalism.\nBaron-Cohen describes empathizing as \u201cthe drive to\nidentify another person\u2019s emotions and thoughts, and\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 293\nto respond to these with an appropriate emotion\u201d\n(Baron-Cohen 2005, p. 468), and he has suggested that\ndeficits in empathizing are core features of autism\n(Baron-Cohen 2002; 2003). But as Troisi says, the fact\nthat the empathic deficit in psychopathy is not associ-\nated with any other deficit in social cognition clearly\ncontradicts the contention that such deficits critically\ncharacterize autism. On the contrary, as he observes,\nindividuals with Williams syndrome show abnormally\nhigh levels of empathy combined with a defective\ntheory of mind, again suggesting that empathizing defi-\ncits cannot be the central factor in autism. However,\nneither psychopathy nor Williams syndrome contradict\nour belief that in ASD, mentalism as defined here is\nunderdeveloped, and that in psychosis, it is hypertro-\nphied. According to our view, Troisi is correct in imply-\ning that psychopathy represents a normal or better-than-\nnormal development of mentalism except for its\nempathizing element, which is pathologically absent,\nand that Williams syndrome represents the exact con-\nverse: spared empathizing ability but with notable defi-\ncits in other aspects of mentalism. In other words, our\ncontention is that, while mentalism includes empathiz-\ning as an important element, the concept embraces\nmuch more and is closer to Baron-Cohen\u2019s earlier,\nmodular model of the social mind (Badcock 2004;\nBaron-Cohen 1995).\nLangdon & Brock\u2019s comments highlight a further\nimportant aspect of our concept of mentalism. Another\nway of describing it would be as our evolved cognitive\nsystem for interacting with other human beings, by con-\ntrast to mechanistic cognition: the cognitive system\nwhich we evolved for interaction with the physical, nonhu-\nman environment (Badcock 2004). This crucial distinction\nis highlighted in Langdon & Brock\u2019s discussion of visual-\nperspective taking and specifically in Langdon and\nColtheart (2001). Here, we would argue that tasks invol-\nving purely visual perspective-taking should be seen as\nmechanistic in contrast to tasks involving mentalistic per-\nspective-taking. Indeed, we would point out that the\nfalse-photo task illustrates the former by comparison\nwith tests of false belief, which represent the latter, and\nthat although autistics symptomatically do worse than\nnormal on false belief, they often do as well or better\nthan normal on the false-photo task (Leekam & Perner\n1991; Leslie & Thaiss 1992; Zaitchik 1990). Furthermore,\nthe fact that autistic artists often show remarkable natural\nperspective skills and are good at guessing how a scene will\nappear from another viewpoint, underlines the point that\nsome of the skills assessed in the cases cited by Langdon\n& Brock might not be mentalistic and consequently do\nnot provide evidence against our view (Grandin &\nJohnson 2005, p. 300). Alternatively, one could interpret\ntheir results as confirming the mentalistic\/mechanistic\ndistinction \u2013 not to mention that, just as our theory pre-\ndicts, schizotypals are poor at mechanistic perspective\nskills (Langdon & Coltheart 2001). As Belmonte percep-\ntively comments, the mentalistic\/mechanistic distinction\napplies not merely to the social brain, but also to cognition\nin general. Indeed, Badcock (in preparation) notes that\nsub-tests that show large sex differences are routinely\nexcluded from standard measures of IQ (e.g., tests of\nmechanical comprehension or \u201cfolk physics\u201d), and he\nsuggests that their inclusion might indicate that there are\ntwo fundamental types of intelligence, rather than one.\nA distinction between conventional IQ and social or\nemotional intelligence has already been suggested\n(Marlowe 1986; Salovey & Mayer 1990), but the funda-\nmental distinction may be one of mentalistic as opposed\nto mechanistic intelligence. Recent studies showing\nsuperior fluid intelligence in autism (Dawson et al. 2007;\nHayashi et al. 2008) accord well with this perspective,\ngiven that such cognitive abilities are abstract, mechani-\ncally inferential, and independent of acquired knowledge.\nR6.2. Hyper-mentalism\nAbu-Akel comments that \u201cThe target article discusses\ndisorders affecting the social brain on \u2018a continuum of cog-\nnitive architecture from mechanistic to mentalistic cogni-\ntion\u2019 [. . .] in which autism and schizophrenia are the\nextremes.\u201d However, we would add that it also discusses\ndisorders affecting the social brain on a continuum ofment-\nalism understood as our evolved capacity to interpret our\nown and others\u2019 behavior in purely mental terms\n(Badcock 2008). As such, mentalism goes beyond theory\nof mind to include empathy, emotion, self-awareness, and\nall other aspects of cognition that could be termed mental\nin any sense (Badcock, in preparation). We would strongly\nunderline and endorse Abu-Akel\u2019s observation that both the\nhypo-mentalism of autism and the hyper-mentalism of psy-\nchosis can and often do result in mentalistic deficits \u2013 an\nimportant point that we have not made sufficiently clear\nfor a number of commentators. Indeed, we never claimed\nthat psychotics would necessarily demonstrate superior\nmentalistic skills across the board, so to speak, only that\nenhanced sensitivity or superior ability might be found in\ncertain respects, such as sensitivity to direction of gaze\n(Langdon et al. 2006b), or to certain types of nonverbal\ncues (LaRusso 1978). The fact that symptoms like delusions\nof being watched or spied upon can be understood as\npathological sensitivity to gaze, that delusions of being\nloved (erotomania) or hated (persecution) can be seen as\nhypertrophied interpretations of other people\u2019s intentions,\nor that delusions of conspiracies can be understood as\nshared attention run amok, does not imply that any of\nthese instances of hyper-mentalism are necessarily real or\naccurate \u2013 on the contrary, the whole point is that they\nrepresent bizarre failures of normal mentalistic interpret-\nation. Just as both under-sensitivity and over-sensitivity to\nlight or sound can be expected to produce impairments in\nsight or hearing, so both over-sensitivity and under-sensi-\ntivity to mental factors can result in measurable mentalistic\ndeficits. In the same way that a teacher who had a hyperac-\ntive child in the class would not be likely to find that child\ndoing extra homework, so we should not assume that\nhyper-mentalism is simply normal mentalizing, plus some\nmore. Quite the opposite, excessive mentalizing will result\nin outcomes that may at times look very like autistic deficits,\nsuch as avoidance of social contact; misunderstanding of\nother\u2019s intentions, emotions, or expressions; inability to\nappreciate humour or irony; misuse or underuse of menta-\nlistic language; and so on.\nAs a specific example, autistics can often feel that people\nare against them and that they are being persecuted, just as\nsome psychotics do, and such paranoia in both conditions\ncould be interpreted as indicative of a common underlying\ncause (van Rijn et al.). However, the only laboratory study\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\n294 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3\nundertaken at the time of writing that compared Asperger\u2019s\nwith paranoid-schizophrenic (and delusional-disorder)\npatients found that the low-level paranoid symptoms in\nthe autistic group arise as a consequence of different mech-\nanisms to those involved in psychotic delusions (Craig et al.\n2004). Moreover, Blackshaw et al. (2001, p. 158) concluded\nthat \u201cthe paranoia observed in Asperger syndrome . . . does\nnot appear to stem from the same factors as seen in the\nparanoia of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia,\u201d and\nthe authors suggest that \u201cthe paranoia seen in Asperger syn-\ndrome is of a different \u2018quality\u2019 to that observed in\nschizophrenia. . . . [I]t may stem from a confusion of not\nunderstanding the subtleties of social interactions and\nsocial rules\u201d rather than being seen as part of a \u201cplot\u201d\nagainst them (Blackshaw et al. 2001). Although a recent\nreport found verbal \u2013 but no nonverbal \u2013 theory-of-mind\ndeficits in schizophrenics with persecutory delusions (Har-\nrington et al. 2005a), an earlier study which looked specifi-\ncally at paranoia concluded that theory-of-mind deficits\nwere not causal or specific to paranoid delusions. Instead,\nits authors suggested that such delusions may be secondary\neffects resulting from information-processing overload in\nschizophrenics (Drury et al. 1998). Earlier still, Bowler\n(1992) used schizophrenics as a control group when he\nexamined theory-of-mind skills in Asperger syndrome and\nexplicitly stated that the schizophrenics\u2019 social impairment\n\u201cdoes not appear to result from an impaired theory of\nmind\u201d (p. 888). Another study \u2013 that of Pickup (2006),\ncited by van Rijn et al. \u2013 found that although higher\nscores on a single dimension of schizotypy were associated\nwith poorer theory-of-mind ability, no association was\nfound between theory of mind and either total ratings of\nschizotypy or ratings of schizotypal traits analogous to the\n\u201cbehavioral signs\u201d of schizophrenia (Pickup 2006). Further-\nmore, the same study pointed out that \u201cit could be argued\nthat poor scores on ToM tasks are related to general deficits\nin attention or motivation, lower IQ, higher doses of anti-\npsychotic medication, poor memory, and\/or greater sever-\nity of illness\u201d (Pickup 2006, p. 178). Finally, a recent meta-\nanalysis of 32 studies of theory of mind in schizophrenia\nwhich cited Abu-Akel\u2019s anticipation of our concept of\nhyper-mentalism concluded that a comparison of autistic\nand psychotic mentalism from this point of view might be\na promising topic for future research (Sprong et al. 2007).\nAt the very least, this establishes that a hyper-mentalistic\ninterpretation of psychotic deficits in theory-of-mind skills\nis still an open question; and at best, that we may expect\nfuture research to explore the possibility in a manner not\nseen up to now.\nR6.3. Psychoanalysis\nBehrendt\u2019s commentary is neo-Freudian to the extent\nthat he implicates \u201cearly life experiences\u201d in schizo-\nphrenia, describes persecutory delusions as \u201cdefences,\u201d\nand charts Kleinian \u201cpositions\u201d in his figure. A parallel\nbetween behaviorism and autistic hypo-mentalism has\nalready been drawn (Baron-Cohen 1989), and the\nsymmetry that we propose between autistic- and\npsychotic-spectrum disorders suggests another between\npsychoanalysis and hyper-mentalism. Whereas behavior-\nism denied the mind and banished all consideration\nof mental content as \u201cunscientific,\u201d neo-Freudian\npsychoanalysis anathematized any recognition of the\nphysical, biological, or genetic basis of the mind as\n\u201cun-psychological.\u201d As a result, mentalistic cognition\ncompletely supervened over the more mechanistic core\noriginally proposed by Freud himself in his instinct\ntheory (Badcock 2002). Behrendt\u2019s commentary is\nclearly more balanced, but does prompt several obser-\nvations regarding psychoanalysis.\nBehaviorism could never have discovered the distinc-\ntive mentalistic deficits that characterize autism\nbecause it ruled the mind out of the question. But the\nimplication of our theory is that psychoanalytic hyper-\nmentalism also disqualifies it from insight into psycho-\ntic-spectrum disorders for the contrary reason: the exces-\nsive mentalizing of neo-Freudian theory and practice\nmakes them part of the problem, not a solution to it.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, traditional psychoanalysis\nseems the very worst possible therapy that anyone on\nthe psychotic side of the mentalistic spectrum could\nreceive. By encouraging the patient to mentalize random-\nly \u2013 in other words, to free-associate, fantasize, and\nreport their dreams \u2013 therapists would be encouraging\nthe very factor that we argue is a root cause of psychotic\nsymptoms: mentalizing to excess. At best, this could\nhardly help patients with hyper-mentalistic tendencies,\nand at worst it might be expected to do real harm.\nIndeed, the hyper-reflexive self-observation that Sass\n(2001) described as a major characteristic of schizo-\nphrenia was institutionalized in psychoanalytic therapy.\nSass quotes a schizophrenic who remarked that \u201cMy\ndownfall was insight. . . . Too much insight can be very\ndangerous, because you can tear your mind apart.\u201d This\npatient did not mention psychoanalysis but seems to\nallude to it when he added, \u201cWell, look at the word \u2018analy-\nsis.\u2019 That means to break apart. When it turns upon the\nself, the mind would rip apart\u201d (Sass 2001).\nWhere disorders at the opposite pole of the mentalistic\ncontinuum are concerned, Freudian child-analysts failed\nto understand autism and how it could be treated.\nThanks to their tendency to over-attribute mentalism to\nchildren and to assume an unconscious, repressed foun-\ndation for the mind, because of their belief in so-called\ninfantile amnesia (Freud 1905\/1953, pp. 174\u201376), Freu-\ndians of all kinds were in the main blind to the revelation\nthat autism was a disorder featuring serious mentalistic\ndeficits.\nSome success can be obtained with autistic children by\nteaching them to mind-read: in other words, to learn\nexplicit mentalistic skills (Howlin et al. 1999). If it is\nindeed true that psychotics are the opposite of this, and\nimplicitly over-mentalize where autistics under-menta-\nlize, it follows that it might be worth trying the opposite\nof psychoanalysis: to teach psychotics the contrary skills\nto those prescribed for autistics. There is evidence that\neven in normal individuals who have suffered bereave-\nment, avoidance of mentalizing their loss reduced grief\nsymptoms after 14 months, and most certainly did not\nincrease them, as conventional Freudian wisdom would\nhave suggested. Avoiding unpleasant thoughts and\nemotions might not be such a bad thing after all\n(Bonanno et al. 1995). If so, an obvious therapeutic\nexperiment would be to try to induce psychotics to be\nhypo-reflective \u2013 or more autistic, if you like \u2013 and con-\nsciously to try to avoid reading too much into each and\nevery thing.\nResponse\/Crespi & Badcock: Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2008) 31:3 295\nR7. Sex and imprinting\nKanazawa draws attention to an important difference\nbetween the imprinted brain theory presented here and\nthe extreme male brain theory of autism originally\nsuggested by Asperger (1944), and recently fully elabo-\nrated by Baron-Cohen (2002; 2003). As Kanazawa rightly\ninfers, and as Badcock implied in his original suggestion\nregarding paranoia as a mentalistic polar opposite of\nautism, it might seem that paranoid schizophrenia corre-\nsponds to an extreme female brain (Badcock 2004).\nHowever, in the target article we have been careful to\npoint out that, according to the theory proposed here, psy-\nchoses-like paranoia represent not so much an extreme\nfemale as an extreme maternal brain, with autism corre-\nspondingly being a question not simply of an extreme\nmale brain, but of an extreme paternal one. Furthermore,\nas our Figure 6 suggests, sex-based variation can be held\northogonal to imprinted-gene variation to give gradations\nbetween four, rather than two, general outcomes.\nKeller requests the basis for our contention that the male\nbrain should be similar to the paternal brain. The answer is\nsimply that all fathers are male and that both aspects are\nassociated, via development, physiology, and behavior,\nwith relatively high demands on the mother. Thus, there is\nconsiderable evidence that sons impose higher costs in ges-\ntation and rearing than do daughters (reviewed in Rickard\net al. 2007), and higher demands from paternally expressed\nimprinted genes are well established from theory and data,\nas described in our target article. A recent article also pro-\nvides imaging evidence that the social-brain network of\nfemales engenders higher altruistic cooperativeness than\nthat of males (Yamasue et al., in press). The partial align-\nments of the paternal brain andmale brain, and thematernal\nbrain with a female brain, should not be seen as conflation,\nbut as key determinants of human neurocognitive architec-\nture, such that jointly considering a male-female axis and a\npaternal-maternal axis (Fig. 6), can successfully explain the\nmale bias to autism, the female bias to relatively mild psy-\nchotic-spectrum conditions, and the relative severities of\nautism in females and schizophrenia in males. We agree\nwith Belmonte that bringing Aristotelian humours and\nbiles up to date requires the positing of much more\nmodern axes structuring development, cognition, and\ndisease risk, which can be sought in the genetic underpin-\nnings of interactions between the development of sexual\ndimorphism and the effects of imprinting. Here, digit\nratios may provide useful insights given their high heritabil-\nity and documented associations with both sex and\nconditions on the autistic and psychotic spectra (Voracek) \u2013\nbut to progress much further, the pleiotropic genes and\ndevelopmental networks underlying digit ratios must be\ndiscerned.\nR8. Conclusions\nIntegrating theory and data in the synthetic analysis of\nneurodevelopmental disorders is a goal shared by\nperhaps all of the commentators, and ourselves. Like\nautism itself, the intellectual underpinnings of this task\ntend to lack central coherence, as well as models of how\nthe world works that are as yet sufficiently robust to\nallow efficient, directed progress. We have described\nwhat we view as a simple, coherent model that makes\nnovel, falsifiable predictions regarding neurodevelopmen-\ntal pattern and process, from genes to behavior. We\nbelieve that the model has survived an intellectual gauntlet\nof expert commentators not just intact, but stronger due to\ntheir perspectives and insights. For these we extend our\nthanks, as well as our apologies to contributors whose\nwork we cannot discuss in more detail.\nAs for the future, at the level of genes,Haig andDavies\n& Isles urge caution in the interpretation of genetic data\nfrom complex theory and sketchy empirical knowledge\nto date. We agree, but also suggest that full elaboration\nof testable theory, even if speculative in parts, provides a\nparadigm to target data collection. Animal models are\ninvaluable to elucidate mechanisms (Burne et al.), but\nour exposition helps define their limits: For example, con-\nservation of imprinting from mouse to man is only partial\n(Glaser et al. 2006; Luedi et al. 2007), and the mentalistic\nabilities of rodents, or even chimps (Povinelli 2000), may\ndiffer from ours in kind as well as scope. In silico and\nneurological studies, with emphasis on perceptual and\nattentional processes affecting development, can more\nclosely address mechanisms of human cognition (Bel-\nmonte, Vladusich), but these must ultimately be\nconnected with psychological constructs. Future psycho-\nlogical analyses require, as Langdon & Brock and Troisi\nsuggest, direct comparisons between individuals on the\nautistic spectrum and psychotic spectrum engaging in the\nsame ecologically valid tasks that probe mechanistic\nversus mentalistic brain functions. The idea of our brains\nbeing subject to genomic conflicts may rest uneasily with\npsychologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists whose\ntasks are challenging enough already, but this cannot be\nhelped. Our brains are imprinted, our cognition is not\nunitary (Hamilton 1996, pp. 133\u201335), and our psyches\nare adapted to comprehend both people and things.\nReferences\n[The letters \u201ca\u201d and \u201cr\u201d before author\u2019s initials stand for target article and\nresponse references, respectively.]\nAbdolmaleky, H.
