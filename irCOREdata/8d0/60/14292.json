Organizationally, this is\ncomposed of four interconnected Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). The high\nbandwidth (155 Mbit\/s) and the network's operation under ATM (Asynchronous Transfer\nMode) enables routine use of high quality video-conferencing between institutions. Each\ninstitution has at least one (all the universities have two) video-conferencing suites, fully\nequipped with audio and video equipment and direct network access for PCs.\nThis unique national infrastructure is being exploited by a number of projects that are\nsupported by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council's (SHEFC) Use of MANs\nInitiative (UMI) (see, for example, Lindsay and Grant, 1998). One such project, the\nNational Learning Network for Remote Sensing (MacLaren, Duncan and Vaughan, 1997),\nis making extensive use of the network to produce, deliver and evaluate Web-based\nlearning materials, virtual laboratories and a programme of shared lectures and seminars.\nThis project is a collaboration between the Universities of Paisley, Edinburgh and Dundee\n4\nAn-J Volume 6 Number 3\nand a wider consortium with membership from several other institutions. The principal\naim is to improve the learning experience of students across Scotland studying remote\nsensing as a specialism within degrees in subjects such as geography, environmental science,\nphysics and engineering. Sharing of resources and expertise, both in research and teaching,\nit is hoped, will improve student understanding and strengthen the somewhat dispersed\nremote sensing community. The materials being developed are at senior undergraduate and\npostgraduate level and the total number of students studying remote sensing in any given\nacademic year is approximately 150-200.\nIn this paper we present details of our initial experiments in the use of video-conferenced\nlectures in actual courses and make a number of recommendations from both technical\nand pedagogical standpoints for the future use of such a medium. Evaluation and user\nfeedback are key aspects of our project and it is due to the conscientious efforts of the\nstudents on these courses in responding to questionnaires and interviews that we have been\nable to learn so much.\nThe recent growth in the use of video-conferencing studios as electronic classrooms\n(Pedersen, 1996; BIC, 1997) and in developing Metropolitan Area Networks to support\nvideo-conferencing has led to various studies of implementation strategies (see, for\nexample several reports by SIMA (Support Initiative for Multimedia Applications)) and\npedagogical design issues (Donert, Brady and Clarkson, 1998). In virtually all of these\ncases the audio-visual material used in teaching is transmitted using the same video\ntechnology as the video conference, that is, it is encoded at PAL (or lower) resolution and\ntransmitted using a codec which involves compression and some loss of signal quality. This\nquality of visual presentation is adequate for some teaching applications, but is inadequate\nfor the computer-aided presentations which are now common. The video signal is\nincapable of supporting current resolutions, commonly 800 x 600 and occasionally higher.\nIn our lectures we used the MANs to support shared applications between computers to\nenable high-resolution displays to be used in a multi-point video-conference.\nVideo-conference lecture programme\nFor several years, a lecturer from the University of Edinburgh has given a short series of\nthree lectures on a rather specialist topic (Synthetic Aperture Radar) to groups of students\nin both his own institution and Heriot-Watt University (also in Edinburgh). However, this\ntopic also features in courses in the Universities of Paisley and Dundee and therefore it was\nrealized that this might form an excellent candidate for the use of video-conferencing. The\nsmall number of lectures might not seem to be appropriate for conclusive statistical\nanalyses, but in fact it did have a distinct advantage in that we were experimenting with a\nnew form of communication and teaching (to the students, at least) in the midst of formal,\nexaminable taught courses. Before a larger fraction of a course could be delivered by such\nmeans, we required detailed evaluation of relevant technical and educational issues to\nensure that students' learning (and examination performance!) was not being placed 'at\nrisk' by presupposing a favourable response.\nFor this exercise, the lectures were presented from Edinburgh University and shared with\nten final-year physics students at Heriot-Watt University, six final-year physics students at\nPaisley University, and eight students taking an M.Sc. in Remote Sensing based at Dundee\ns\nCharles Duncan et al Shared teaching with multimedia-enhanced video-conferencing\nUniversity. For the students at Heriot-Watt and Paisley these lectures were a compulsory\npart of their course and the material covered was examinable in their finals. The\narrangement for the Dundee students was that these lectures were a voluntary (but\nrecommended) supplement to their existing course.\nOffering lectures via this medium poses a number of challenges. For example, the\narrangement in a typical video-conferencing suite is such that the participants are faced\nwith two TV monitors, one displaying the outgoing picture from that studio and the other\ndisplaying the incoming signal (Figure 1).\nFigure l:Two monitors in the Edinburgh studio showing (\u00a1eft) the outgoing signal and (right) the\nincoming signal from Dundee since students there had just responded to a question.\nIn addition a desktop 'visualizer' enables the participants to present paper-based materials,\ntransparencies, slides and indeed small objects. The presenter can switch between the main\nstudio camera and this visualizer. In a subject such as remote sensing, however, it is often\nimportant to be able to present high-quality digital images and even illustrative animations\nthat help explain complex issues such as orbits, scanning, etc. In recent years a number of\nlecturers have been making limited but increasing use of presentation technologies such as\nPowerPoint displays on data projectors and LCD panels in their classes. To use such\nmaterials in the course of a video-conferenced lecture would typically mean converting the\nappropriate computer display output to a lower quality PAL signal. After a number of initial\nexperiments we were led to the conclusion that the loss of quality was such that we required\nan alternative approach. In addition, were the signal to be passed through the main video-\n6\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nconferencing display the students would lose 'face-to-face' contact with the lecturer whilst the\nslides, images and animations were being presented.\nOur approach to this problem exploited the existing network connections in each video-\nconferencing suite and is described in detail in the next section.\nEnhancing video-conferences with multimedia materials\nThe intention, then, is to be able to display high-quality graphics and PowerPoint\npresentations at all participating sites whilst simultaneously allowing the participants to\nview the lecturer. Ideally, the PowerPoint slides and graphics should, of course be under\nthe control of the remote lecturer so that the presentations at all locations were synchron-\nized and individual slides could be revisited or skipped if necessary. The only available tool\nwe were able to identify that was capable of this was Microsoft NetMeeting.\nMicrosoft NetMeeting (2.1) is a software tool for linking several Windows (95\/NT) PCs in\na conference session to enable communication and collaboration (Microsoft, 1998). Up to\n32 participants in a 'NetMeeting' can join a common chat session and share control of the\nbuilt-in whiteboard. Two participants at a time can speak to each other using the audio\nfacility, and see each other if their machines have suitable video equipment. A very useful\nfacility allows an application running on one of the machines in the meeting to be 'shared'\nwith all the others. This application can take up the whole screen, allowing one participant\nto control the displays on all the other machines in the meeting. In 'collaborate' mode,\ncontrol of this application can be passed to another participant at any remote site.\nMicrosoft NetMeeting can be downloaded freely from the Microsoft web-site,\nwww.microsoft.com.\nThis approach required that all the video-conferencing suites involved had an ethernet\nconnection, a Windows 95\/NT PC, and a data-projector or large monitor. Network\nsupport at some sites questioned the wisdom of using noisy data-projectors in relatively\nsmall rooms, with sensitive microphones using preset switching thresholds, but in the event\nthis did not prove a significant problem.\nRehearsals and tests\nPrior to the actual lecture series a number of trials were undertaken to determine the\noptimum configuration of the hardware and software for our specific needs. Whilst\nNetMeeting is used extensively for informal communication by individuals and\norganizations, its deployment in our project required a number of specific technical issues to\nbe addressed. These are listed as follows.\nHow can we be sure that the displays are synchronized and we can rely on everyone seeing the\nsame display at all times?\nTo test the response time, the video-conferencing system was used to relay the display back\nto the originating site by simply pointing a video camera at the computer screen. The\nquality was degraded but it was easy to see screen changes. In all cases the remote displays\nchanged within one second of the originating display.\n7\nCha\u00f1es Duncan et al Shared teaching with multimedia-enhanced video-conferencing\nWould the synchronization allow PowerPoint animations to be adequately represented?\nA simple test using PowerPoint with 'flying' bullet points showed that all frames are not\ntransmitted to the remote display. A 'flying' bullet point might only appear once at the edge\nof the screen and then in its final destination. Sometimes it would only appear in its final\ndestination so that the animated effect was completely missed at the remote site. This\nrevealed that animations must be quite slow to be viewed remotely and that a better\napproach, used successfully during these lectures, is to create an animated effect by\nbuilding a diagram from many components. The display of each subsequent component\ncan then be controlled by a mouse click on the originating machine. The build-up is slow\nbut nevertheless it should add to the student's understanding. One example of the use of\nthis technique was the propagation of a wave front and its interaction with several objects\n(Figure 2).\nOperation\nFigure 2: Example PowerPoint slide containing 'animated wavefront sequence.\nIs it better to use an ILS (Internet) or direct IP (Internet Protocol) connections?\nMicrosoft and others provide directory servers, which allow NetMeeting users to find each\nother by name or email address. However these servers are based in the USA, and are quite\nheavily used, so using them in the UK can cause delays, especially in the afternoon. We\ntherefore required that each participating PC placed a direct call to the IP address of the\n'host' machine (i.e. the PC at the lecturer's site).\nDirect IP connections were found to be faster and worked satisfactorily even when the\noriginating machine was a 33MHz 486. In practice, however, we used a Pentium 166 with\n32Mb RAM for the lecture series since a higher specification did give improved\n8\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nMedia type Examples of organizing the structure New(hours) Existing Resources required(hours)\nAsynchronous bulletin board\nAudio-vision\nAudioossette\nBroadcast TV\nEmail\nFill in the gaps\nHypertext\nMicroworlds\nMultimedia\nRadio\nSAQs\nSimulations\nSynchronous audio\nconferencing\nSynchronous chat systems\nSynchronous, video\nconferencing\nTutorial Program\nTutorial Simulation\nTutorial System\nVideo-cassette\nWhiteboards\nFieldtrips\nFormal exam \u2022\nLecture\nPractic\u00e1is\nPrint (handouts or workbooks)\nProgress tests\nSeminar\nTutorial-S\/S\nTutorial -T\/S\nSet up forums and write activities\nPrepare script and record, write handout\nPrepare script and record\nPrepare script and record\nDefine use\nDesign and word process fill in the gaps\nProduce HTML documents and gift\nAuthor microworld or provide\naccompanying explanations\nAuthor material and record clips\nPrepare script and record\nAuthor questions\nAuthor simulation or set the scene for\nthe exercise\nSet the scene\nWrite instructions and define use\nSet the scene or prepare \"lecture\"\nAuthor program or provide instructions\nAuthor program or provide instructions\nAuthor program or provide instructions\nPrepare script and record\nPrepare instructions for use\nPrepare activities, arrange bookings\nWord Process, Exam boards\nOrganize notes, write OHPs or\nslide presentations\nDesign and test experiments.\nWrite manual, Order materials\nWord process material\nWord process\nSet seminar topic\nSetting the scene for student-led tutorial\nPrepare tutorial sheet\n2-5\n50-200\n20-100\n50-500\n0-1\n5-20\n2-10\n5-200\n100-200\n20-100\n5-20\n5-100\n2-3 .\n0-1\n2-5\n20-100\n75-300\n50-200\n50-200\n1-2\n5-20\n10-15\n2-5\n10-20\n5-20\n2-5\n0-3\n0-1\n2-5\n0\n5-20\n2-10\n5-20\n0\n1-5\n5-20\n5-20\n5-20\naudio)\n2-10-\n2-5\n5-20\n0\n0\n0\n5-20\n5-20\n5-20\n5-20\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1-5\n0\n0\n0\n0\nBB Software\nRecording equipment script\nRecording equipment script\nRecording equipment script\nEmail software\n-\nHTML editor, browser\nMMPC microworld software,\nauthoring software\nMMPC Multimedia software\n(authoring, graphics, and\nBroadcasting equipment script\nAssessment software\nMMPC simulation software,\nauthoring software\nBroadcasting and reception\nequipment and\/or software\nChat software\nBroadcasting and reception\nequipment and\/or software\nMMPC tutoring software,\nauthoring software\nMMPC, tutoring software,\nauthoring software\nMMPC tutoring software,\nauthoring software\nRecording equipment script\nWhiteboard software\nTransport, location,\naccommodation\n-\nOverheads, presentation\nsoftware\nLab, equipment materials\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTable I: Preparatory work comparison chart\ngrading.

Worth noting are the\nlow scores assigned to tutor reflection on many of the computer-based media. This reflects\na worry that tutors who rely on these in place of face-to-face teaching may lose track of\nstudents' progress.\nThe scores also stress the value of traditional teaching using tutorials and seminars. This\ncomplements research which shows what students enjoy most is small group tutorials, and\n\u2014\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 3\nDundee\nPaisley\nHeriot-Watt\nTotal\n8\n6\n10\n24\nfeedback questionnaire. The three questionnaires were tailored specifically to each video-\nconference (VC) and the questions varied. The ability to see how attitudes changed, was\naffected somewhat by the fact that different numbers of students attended each session\nwith the numbers ranging from 24 at the first video-conference (VC1) to 15 at VC2 and 9 at\nVC3 (see Table 1).\nVCI VC2 VC3\n7\n4 5\n7 4\n15 9\nTable I: Numbers of students attending the three videcxonference lectures\nThis fall-off in attendance is not as telling as it may first seem however, since the Dundee\nstudents had a prior commitment on the day of the third lecture. Instead, the only\nnoticeable fall-off in attendance was from the Heriot-Watt students.\nAs well as being asked specific questions, in each questionnaire, students were encouraged\nto write any comments they had. Most comments came after the first (and best attended)\nvideo-conference. All students who attended completed the questionnaires.\nExpectations\nOf the 24 students attending VCI, only 4 had attended a video-conference before. It was\nencouraging then, that 83.3 per cent of these students indicated that the experience was less\nconfusing than they had expected, with only 12.5 per cent saying it was more so (the\nremainder found it the same as expected).\nQuestions\nA total of 62.5 per cent of the students attending VCI felt 'more remote from the lecturer\nthan in a traditional lecture' (20.8 per cent felt less remote and 16.7 per cent felt the same).\nThese results may indicate a serious disadvantage of video-conferencing in that the\ninteractive element of lecturing was lost. One student did comment 'you can not talk to the\nteacher personally'. However, the students felt more able to ask questions as the lectures\nwent on. In the first lecture students were asked if they felt more or less able to ask\nquestions than in a conventional lecture. Of the 24 students attending, 20 answered that\nthey felt less able to ask questions, while the remainder said they felt the same as in a\nnormal lecture. At each of the subsequent lectures they were asked if they now felt\nmore able to answer questions. At the second lecture seven now felt more able to ask\nquestions than at the first lecture while seven still felt inhibited. At the third lecture a\nfurther four students said they now felt more able to ask questions than they had in the\nsecond lecture.\nIt should be noted, that despite this improvement, no unprompted questions were asked\nthroughout the series of lectures. However, it is common that very few questions are asked\nduring technical lectures and the reticence to ask questions may not be significant since the\nI l\nCharles Duncan et 0\/ Shared teaching with multimedia-enhanced video-conferencing\nmain reason given for not asking questions was that they 'simply couldn't think of\nanything to ask'. This was the response for 73.3 per cent at VC2 and 66.7 per cent at VC3.\nEnjoyment\nAt VC1, 41.7 per cent of students indicated that they enjoyed this method of teaching\nmore than their normal lectures, but the same proportion enjoyed it less. The remaining\n16.6 per cent of students enjoyed it the same amount or made no response. However, two\nstudents noted that they enjoyed it more only because of novelty value. One comment was\nthat 'it's a great idea but only sometimes', while another was it's 'not that bad really'!\nWhen the students were asked at VC1 if they would use this method of teaching again, 58.3\nper cent said yes, 25 per cent said no, 23.5 per cent said maybe, and the remainder gave no\nanswer.\nIn a similar question at the end of VC3, the students were asked how they would feel about\nhaving a larger portion of their course delivered in this way. To this, 66.7 per cent gave a\npositive response while the remaining third replied in the negative. Despite this, when at the\nend of VC3 they were asked if they felt cheated or disadvantaged by being taught by VC,\nall but one student said no (the remaining one gave no answer).\nEffectiveness\nIn each video-conference, the students were asked how well they learned in comparison to\ntraditional lectures; i.e. how effective they felt this method of teaching was. The answers to\nthis question varied as the video-conferences progressed as shown in the Table 2 below.\nOne student commented about VC1 that 'this lecture was very well done, I learned more,\nbut not because of the video' while another noted that it was more effective 'once you get\nused to it'. The novelty value, and conversely some of the antipathy to the method, seemed\nto have worn off with time so that by VC3, 88.9 per cent of the students felt they learned\nabout as well in a video-conference as in a traditional lecture (see Table 2).\n%\nMore\nSame\nLess\nOther\nVCI\n20.8\n33.3\n33.3\n12.5\nVC2\n20 \u2022\n53.3\n20\n6.7\nVC3\n88.9\nII.1\n-\nTable 2: Percentages of students commenting on the effectiveness of this teaching method compared\nto traditional lectures (percentages may not sum to 100 per cent due to rounding).\nOne student noted that it was 'difficult to answer (about effectiveness) because it depends\non the lecturer and lecture content'. In effect, the video-conferencing was not thought to\nobscure or augment the quality of the teaching.\nThe students at Heriot-Watt and those at Paisley were formally assessed in written\nexaminations on the material in these lectures. There was a choice of questions in the\nexamination so students could have avoided this topic. However, all four students who\nattended all the lectures from Heriot-Watt and all the students from Paisley attempted the\n12\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nquestion on this topic and the average marks were equal to or slightly higher than the\nmarks for other questions in the exams.\nTeaching aids\nFinally, the quality of the dynamic PowerPoint teaching aids, were generally found to be of\na high quality as indicated by Table 3.\n0\/\nA\nExcellent\nReadable\nBarely readable\nUnreadable\nNo answer\nVCI\n29.2\n54.2\n12.5\n\u2014\n4.2\nVC2\n66.7\n33.3\n\u2014\n\u2014\n-\nVC3\n66.7\n33.3\n\u2014\n\u2014\n-\nTable 3: Percentages of students commenting on the quality of the teaching aids (percentages may not\nsum to 100 per cent due to rounding).\nCost-effectiveness?\nIt is not possible, on the basis of this small experiment, to determine the cost-effectiveness\nof this method of teaching. It is, however, worth drawing attention to aspects that affect\ncost-effectiveness.\n\u2022 Infrastructure costs: The video conference network used in this study is 'free at the\npoint of use'. It is, of course, not free, but it is financed at a national level so that those\nwho book time are not individually charged. The network used for the MANs is leased\nannually, hot on a 'per use' basis. The greater the use, the more cost-effective this will\nbe. Although network ports exist in each VC studio the computers and projection\nequipment are not yet permanently installed and must be set up for each use.\n\u2022 Rehearsal: Since this was the first time any of those involved had used this technology\nthere was a great deal of rehearsal and testing amounting to about five one-hour\nsessions. By the time of the lectures, however, confidence in the system was sufficiently\nhigh that we required only ten minutes prior to each lecture to set up and test the\ntechnology.\n\u2022 Delivery: During a lecture it is usual for only one lecturer to be involved. During these\ndistributed lectures a member of the course organizing staff at each site remained with\nthe students throughout the lectures to solve any technical problems. It is advisable for\none person to have this responsibility at each site and once the computer-based\ncommunication is fully integrated with the other video-conference facilities it seems\nlikely this would become a responsibility of an 'on-call' AV technician supporting the\nVC suite.\n\u2022 Preparation: Although the three lectures given in this experiment were already prepared\nand had been given several times before, the lecturer felt it necessary to improve the\nvisual aids to compensate for the lack of physical presence. The time taken to prepare\n13\nChartes Duncan et al Shared teaching with multimedia-enhanced video-conferencing\nthese visual aids was approximately four hours per lecture. The most time-consuming\npart was building animated diagrams that could be controlled to ensure that each frame\ncan be guaranteed to be delivered to the remote site.\nConclusions\nIn spite of the relatively small number of lectures and students we can draw some\nsignificant conclusions on the technical feasibility of this approach and more tenuous\nconclusions about the educational value and cost-effectiveness.\n\u2022 Technical feasibility: The use of shared applications through NetMeeting in support of\nmulti-point video-conferenced teaching has been shown to be stable enough for\npractical use. The video-conference component used the Scottish MANs ATM network\nand the shared applications used the same MAN network through TCP\/IP. The time\ntaken to set up the system was minimal once the necessary tests had been completed.\nConsideration is now being given to making networked PCs and data projectors\nstandard equipment in all of the Scottish (HEI) video-conferencing suites.\n\u2022 Educational value: There is no evidence that delivering lectures by video-conference\nproduces an educational benefit over traditional lectures (except perhaps that the\nlecturer works harder on visual aids!), nor should we expect there to be. Our primary\nconcern is, rather, that there is no disadvantage to the students learning, or that such\nthat exist are minimized. Students did show an increasing acceptance of the method as\nthey became used to it and none felt they had been disadvantaged.\n\u2022 Cost-effectiveness: During this experiment a significant amount of time was spent on\ntesting and during the lectures a member of academic staff was present at each site.\nThis suggests that any saving in staff time is marginal, resulting from only one of the\nstaff members having preparatory work for the lecture. As the novelty wears off it is\nlikely that less staff time at the remote sites will be required and very little rehearsal. A\ndistinct advantage is that some students can hear lectures on topics that could not be\nprovided in their own institutions. This is likely to be of considerable benefit in the\nmore specialist subjects and could lead to multi-institution courses where staff at each\ninstitution contribute part of a course to the students of all participating institutions.\nThere is also great potential for multi-point tutorials although the dynamics of\ndistributed group discussions will require careful thought.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the lecturers, students and technical support staff at each of the\ninstitutions that participated in these experiments for their efforts, patience and openness\nto new approaches to teaching. We would also like to acknowledge the financial support of\nSHEFC under its use of MANs initiative. Thanks also to Prof. Gordon Peckham for\nallowing these lectures to be used in part of his course at Heriot-Watt University and to\nBrian Cameron for his photographic assistance.\nReferences\nBIC (1997), 'Blueprint for interactive classrooms', http:\/\/avc.ucd.ie\/BIC\/.\n14\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nDonert, K., Brady, S. and Clarkson, J.
