INTRODUCTION\nExamples of fluctuation-induced transitions can be found\nin many branches of science, from diffusion in solids and\nprotein folding, to switching in lasers f1g and resonantly\ndriven trapped electrons f2g. In many situations, it is impor-\ntant not only to estimate the escape probability, but also to be\nable to control it, which, in turn, requires additional informa-\ntion about the structure of the escape paths connecting meta-\nstable states.\nThe complex structure of chaotic limit sets existing in\nphase space, and the fractality of the basin boundaries sepa-\nrating coexisting attractors f3\u20136g, inevitably make the analy-\nsis of fluctuational transitions an extremely difficult and\nchallenging problem. The main difficulty stems from delicate\nquestions about the uniqueness of solutions and the boundary\ncondition on the chaotic attractor and\/or on the fractal basin\nboundary sFBBd. A number of interesting analytic results\nwere obtained for the escape problem in one- and two-\ndimensional linear chaotic maps f7\u20139g using the methods of\ntransition state theory. However, exact analytic results are\nnot readily available for the general case of a nonlinear map.\nInstead, an asymptotic analysis of the escape problem in the\nlimit of weak noise developed for continuous systems ssee,\ne.g., f10gd and extended to maps f11,12g can be adopted for\nchaotic systems f13\u201316g.\nIn this approach, an auxiliary Hamiltonian system sfor\nflowsd, or an auxiliary area-preserving map, is introduced\ndescribing the fluctuational motion as a motion along certain\ndeterministic trajectories. The solution of the escape problem\nis then given by the solution of the boundary value problem\nin the extended phase space of the auxiliary system: it is the\nsolution yielding the trajectory of minimal energy connecting\nthe attractor to the boundary of its basin of attraction. We\nemphasise that these deterministic trajectories underlying\nfluctuational motion are not mere theoretical abstractions,\nbut can be observed experimentally f17,18g.\nThe main difficulty in application of these results to cha-\notic systems lies in the fact that the boundary conditions are\nin general not known, neither at the chaotic attractor nor on\nthe fractal basin boundary. For one-dimensional maps, the\nproblem of specifying boundary conditions can sometimes\nbe sidestepped f14g by carrying out minimization over all\npossible initial conditions on the chaotic attractor. Clearly,\nsuch an approach cannot be extended to higher-dimensional\nfractal structures.\nRecently, however, it was shown that the problem of es-\ncape in chaotic systems with fractal boundaries can be con-\nsiderably simplified. First, it was demonstrated f19\u201321g and\nindependently confirmed f22g that unique boundary condi-\ntions can be identified on a chaotic attractor. Second, our\nrecent studies have shown that fluctuational transitions\nacross a locally disconnected sLDd FBB occur via a deter-\nministic mechanism. We have also shown that escape occurs\nvia a unique accessible boundary point on the LD FBB and\nthat the structure of escape paths inside the LD FBB is de-\ntermined by a hierarchy of points in a homoclinic tangle\nf23g. Moreover, it was inferred that the mechanism in ques-\ntion should be common among many chaotic maps and\nflows.\nIn this paper, we describe in more detail the mechanism of\nfluctuational transition across both LD and locally connected\nsLCd FBBs, and we demonstrate that our prediction about the\ncommon nature of the described mechanism is indeed cor-\nrect.\nIt was shown earlier that the presence of the homoclinic\ntangencies that cause fractalization of the basin boundary\nalso leads to a decrease in activation energy f24,25g. In the\npresent paper, we give theoretical and numerical evidence to\ndemonstrate that the predicted mechanism is valid for sys-\ntems showing \u201cfractal-fractal\u201d basin boundary metamorpho-\nses. This allows one to study the activation energy and the\noptimal transition path even when the fractal boundary and\nthe escape path experience discontinuous changes. We show\nthat the noise can effectively move the accessible point in-\nside the open neighborhood containing an attractor. Finally,\nby studying fluctuational transitions across an LC FBB, we\nhave been able to find a unique optimal escape path and an\noptimal fluctuational force, even for this qualitatively differ-\nent case.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 046203 s2005d\n1539-3755\/2005\/71s4d\/046203s10d\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society046203-1\nWe emphasize that, by exploitation of an analogy between\nthe variational formulation of the control problem, and noise-\ninduced escape from the domain of attraction f26g, we are\nenabled to find both the optimal escape path and the corre-\nsponding optimal force that causes switching of complex\nchaotic systems between coexisting stable states. This non-\nlinear approach to the problem of steered transitions between\ncoexisting stable states is of broad interdisciplinary interest\nand is closely related to problems of control and stability of\ncomplex nonlinear dynamical systems f27,28g.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Secs. II A and II B,\nwe review briefly some of our relevant recent results, de-\nscribing in detail the procedures for computation of the acti-\nvation energy. In Sec. II C, a proof based on topological\narguments is given to account for our observation that escape\ntakes place at an accessible point on the basin boundary, and\nthe procedures used for minimization of the activation en-\nergy are presented. Section III is devoted to the study of\nnoise-induced escape from a periodic attractor in the Henon\nmap. It is known that, for some values of the control param-\neter, this system possesses a so-called \u201cfractal-fractal\u201d basin\nboundary crisis, where the FBB drastically change its form,\nspreading inside the open neighborhood containing the at-\ntractor f29g. We analyze the structure of the optimal escape\npaths and generalize the notion of a noisy precursor of bifur-\ncation to the interesting case of boundary crisis in the pres-\nence of noise. Section IV deals with fluctuation transitions\nacross a closed nowhere-differentiable LC FBB in a nonana-\nlytic quadratic map. Our conclusions are given in Sec. V.\nII. FLUCTUATIONAL TRANSITIONS\nACROSS THE LD FBB\nTo study fluctuation transitions through an LD FBB, we\ntook as a model the Holmes map f30g driven by noise,\nxn+1 = yn,\nyn+1 = \u2212 bxn + dyn \u2212 yn\n3 + jn, s1d\nwhere jn is zero-mean white Gaussian noise of variance D.\nDue to symmetry, the noise-free system s1d has pairs of co-\nexisting attractors for b=0.2 and 2.0\u0142d\u01422.745, the basins\nof which are separated by a boundary that may be either\nsmooth or fractal, depending on the chosen values of param-\neters. We chose for our studies b=0.2 and d=2.7, which\ncorresponds to there being two coexisting CA basins sepa-\nrated by an LD FBB. One of them is shown in Fig. 1sad. The\nfractal dimension of the boundary, determined numerically\nby using the \u201cuncertainty exponent\u201d technique f31g, is\n1.844 72. The chaotic attractors sCAsd in Eqs. s1d appear as\nthe result of a period-doubling cascade and, for the chosen\nvalues of parameters, each of them consists of two discon-\nnected parts. It should be noted that the properties of this\nmap, including the structures both of its CA and of its locally\ndisconnected FBB, are generic for a wide class of maps and\nflow systems f4,6g. For instance, a similar map was intro-\nduced recently to model the localized breathing oscillations\nof Bose-Einstein condensates in periodic traps f32g. Taken\ntogether with the results of our investigations of escape in\nFIG. 1. sad sColor onlined One of the coexisting CAs is indicated\nby the centrally placed filled curve.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 046203 s2005d\n046203-2\nother systems, these considerations allow us to conclude that\nthe escape mechanism we describe is indeed a typical one.\nA. Statistical analysis of escape trajectories\nWe excited the system s1d with weak noise and collected\nboth the trajectories that provide escape paths from one CA\nto the other and the corresponding realizations of noise that\ninduced them. Averaging a few hundred such escape trajec-\ntories and noise realizations, we obtained the optimal escape\npath and the corresponding optimal force, which are shown\nin Fig. 1. The results of this statistical analysis allow us to\ndetermine the boundary conditions near the CA and on the\nFBB, and to demonstrate the uniqueness of the MPEP. It can\nbe seen in particular that the system s1d leaves the CA falling\ninto a small neighborhood of the saddle point of period 1\nsS1d located between its two disconnected parts. Its stable\nmanifold separates the parts of the CA, while the unstable\none approaches the CA. Furthermore, the system makes a\nfew iterations in some small neighborhood of S1 fsmall pla-\nteau in Fig. 1sbdg and then moves in a few steps to the FBB,\ncrossing it at the saddle point of period 3 sS3d.\nCalculations have shown that S3 for the chosen parameter\nvalues lies on the FBB. Moreover, its stable manifold ssolid\nblack line in Fig. 1d is dense f33g in the FBB and detaches\nthe open neighborhood including an attractor from the FBB\nitself, thus allowing us to classify it as an accessible bound-\nary point f23,29,34g. Indeed, by definition a boundary point\nP is accessible from a region if there is a curve of finite\nlength connecting P to a point in the interior of the region\nsuch that no point of the curve lies in the boundary except\nfor P. In the case of the saddle S3, the part of the unstable\nmanifold of S3 approaching the CA and lying inside the open\nneighborhood plays the role of such a curve. It should be\nnoted that boundary point S3 is the only saddle point belong-\ning to the homoclinic structure whose stable and unstable\nmanifolds are not tangent to each other. All other homoclinic\npoints are buried in the FBB and inaccessible from the open\nneighborhood including CA because of such tangencies.\nMoreover, in the absence of noise, S3 is the only saddle point\nin the FBB from which the noise-free system s1d can relax to\nan attractor in a finite number of iterations. For all other\ninitial conditions taken in inaccessible saddle points, the\nnoise-free system s1d must stay inside the FBB infinitely\nlong f29g. In other words, the saddle point S3 is the ho-\nmoclinic point closest to the CA whose stable manifold sepa-\nrates the interior, including the CA, from the FBB. This situ-\nation is similar, in some respects, to the case of fluctuational\ntransitions across the smooth basin boundary formed by the\nstable manifold of a saddle boundary point. For that case, it\nis well known that phase trajectories approach a saddle point\nwith zero velocity. For this reason, the action calculated in\nsome small neighborhood of the separatrix takes its minimal\nvalue at a saddle point f35g. The present case is much more\nintricate due to the far more complicated structure of the\nbasin boundary and the large number of saddles embedded in\nthe boundary.\nB. Variational formulation of the problem\nCalculation of the MPEP requires an understanding of the\nmechanism of escape from the initial state to the boundary of\nits basin of attraction. According to the Hamiltonian theory\nof fluctuations valid in the limit D\u21920 f13\u201316g, the MPEP is\nthe path which minimizes the \u201cenergy\u201d defined as f36g\nS =\n1\n2on=1\nN\njWn\nTjWn. s2d\nHere the minimization has to be performed over all possible\nrealizations of noise hjnj that induce a transition of the sys-\ntem s1d from the CA swith the initial condition on the S1d to\nthe FBB. The constraint between coordinates hxnj and hjnj\ndefined by Eq. s1d is implemented through introduction of a\nset of Lagrange undetermined multipliers hlnj f15g. In this\nway, the minimization of energy s2d over hjnj is equivalent to\nthe minimization of\nL =\n1\n2on=1\nN\njWn\nTjWn + o\nn=1\nN\nlWn\nTfxWn+1 \u2212 fWsxnd \u2212 jWng ,\nover hjnj, hlnj, and hxnj. Here fWsxd is the deterministic part of\nthe map.\nThe result of the minimization is the following area-\npreserving map:\nxn+1 = yn,\nyn+1 = \u2212 bxn + dyn \u2212 yn\n3 + ln\ny\n,\nln+1\nx\n= sd \u2212 3xn+1\n2 dln\nx\/b \u2212 ln\ny\/b ,\nln+1\ny\n= ln\nx\n. s3d\nThe evolution of the \u201cenergy\u201d along the solution of Eq. s3d is\ngoverned by\nSn+1 = Sn +\n1\n2\nsln\nyd2. s4d\nC. Boundary conditions\nIn order to describe the process of escape from the vicin-\nity of the initial structure, a path solution of the extended\nmap is required that minimizes the \u201cenergy\u201d s4d. We want to\ndescribe here the boundary conditions on the basin boundary\nfor such a trajectory and we seek to prove that they have to\nbe chosen on an accessible saddle on the boundary. In what\nfollow, we refer to the notation in Fig. 2: V1 indicates the\naccessible part of the basin of attraction of the stable struc-\nture; dV is the accessible part of the basin boundary, i.e., the\nstable manifold of the accessible saddle S3; it separates V1\nfrom the remaining part of the coordinate space, here indi-\ncated as V2. V2 is the set of all points in the space not\naccessible from V1. We start by proving that V1 is mapped\ninto a subset of V1. This means that no points in V1 are\nmapped into V2. Composed of accessible points, V1 is a\nconnected set smore precisely an arcwise connected setd,\nwhile V1 and V2 are separated by dV. As the continuous\nimage of a connected set is a connected set, and at least one\npoint of V1 is mapped inside V1, the whole V1 is mapped\nFLUCTUATIONAL TRANSITIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 046203 s2005d\n046203-3\ninto a subset of itself. In other words, a noise-free trajectory\ncannot \u201cjump over\u201d the basin boundary. As a second step, we\ngive an argument that proves that an \u201cenergy\u201d-optimal es-\ncape path out of V1 should terminate on the basin boundary.\nLet us proceed as follows. The escape is realized when a\npoint x inside V1 is mapped into a point y* in dV or in V2.\nFrom the previous argument, we know that fsxd sthe noise-\nfree image of xd is still inside V1. The \u201cenergy\u201d cost to be\nminimized for the transition is 12 fy*\u2212 fsxdgTfy*\u2212 fsxdg, on all\npossible y*P hdV ,V2j. The \u201cenergy\u201d cost is clearly minimal\nfor a point y on dV ssee Fig. 2d. Finally, every point on dV\ncan be connected via a noise-free path to the saddle embed-\nded in it. This means that among all possible points on dV,\nthe saddle has the least \u201cenergy\u201d and that the escape must\ntake place through the accessible saddle S3.\nIn order to describe the escape process, therefore, the sys-\ntem s3d has to be solved with the following boundary condi-\ntions:\nlim\nn\u2192\u2212\u2018\nln\ny\n= 0, sxn\n0\n,yn\n0d P S1, sxn\n1\n,yn\n1d P S3. s5d\nThe MPEP is the solution of this boundary-value problem\nthat minimizes the cost s4d. It is known that, in the phase\nspace, the MPEP is a heteroclinic trajectory connecting S1\nand S3 f37\u201341g. In general, the location of this trajectory is a\nvery complicated problem, due to the singular shape of the\nunstable manifold of S1 f40\u201342g and the presence of mul-\ntiple local minima of the energy f43g. The key step in per-\nforming the minimization and solving the boundary-value\nproblem is the description of the family of solutions of Eq.\ns3d on the unstable manifold of S1 by the use of an appro-\npriate number of parameters f44g. In the vicinity of S1, the\nunstable manifold is a plane in the phase space. It can be\ndescribed by introduction of a linear constraint between the\ncoordinates and \u201cmomenta\u201d lW =MdxW, where dxW represents the\ndisplacement from S1. M is a real matrix. In order to calcu-\nlate the coefficients in the M matrix, the system s3d is ex-\npanded about S1 to give\ndxn+1 = Adxn + ln,\nln+1 = A\u22121Tln, s6d\nwhere A is the Jacobian matrix of the original map calculated\nin S1.\nThe eigenvalues for the map s6d are a1, a2, a1\n\u22121\n, a2\n\u22121\n. The\nstable eigenvectors associated with the contracting eigenval-\nues are called es1 and es2, where the index s indicates stable.\nThe unstable eigenvectors are denoted by eu1 and eu2. A ge-\nneric point on the unstable manifold can be written as a\ncombination of eu1 and eu2,\nSxW\nlW\nD = cu1SeWu1x\neWu1l\nD + cu2SeWu2x\neWu2l\nD . s7d\nHere uWu1,2x and eu1,2l represent the x and l components of\nthe eigenvectors eWu1,2. Writing the vectors x and l explicitly,\nusing their components x ,y ,lx ,ly, one obtains a set of linear\nequations,\nSx\ny\nD = Seu1x eu2x\neu1y eu2y\nDScu1\ncu2\nD ,\nSlx\nly\nD = Seu1lx eu2lx\neu1ly eu2ly\nDScu1\ncu2\nD .\nUse of standard linear algebra techniques yields a linear re-\nlationship between xW and lW ,\nM = Seu1lx eu2lx\neu1ly eu2ly\nDSeu1x eu2x\neu1y eu2y\nD\u22121. s8d\nThus a single trajectory in the pattern of solutions can be\ndefined by providing its initial conditions in the coordinate\nspace and the corresponding momenta can be obtained using\nthe matrix M. The whole family of trajectories on the un-\nstable manifold can be defined by supplying a region of ini-\ntial conditions in a neighborhood of S1. A possible choice can\nbe, for example, the area included between two circles cen-\ntered in S1 with radii r1 and r2 chosen so as to include all\npossible trajectories in the pattern. The parameters used to\ndescribe a single trajectory can be the angular position and\nthe distance r1\u0142r,r2 from S1. The evolution of a trajectory\nis followed until it exits the boundary and the escape \u201cen-\nergy\u201d is then recorded. In this way, the \u201cenergy\u201d is defined as\na real function in the space of parameters. For the system s1d,\nthe parameter space is diffeomorph f45g to a torus T2, i.e., it\ncan be mapped into a torus T2 using an invertible function h\nsuch that h and h\u22121 are C\u2018. The \u201cenergy\u201d function can be\nvery wild and singular f44g but a minimization is neverthe-\nless still possible. The MPEP found by this method is shown\nin Fig. 1. It can be seen that the MPEP predicted by the\nHamiltonian theory coincides with that obtained by statistical\nanalysis of the escape trajectories in Monte Carlo simula-\ntions. Note that no action is required to bring the system to\nanother attractor after it has reached the accessible orbit on\nthe FBB.\nD. Structure of the escape path inside the FBB\nAn analysis of the structure of escape paths inside the\nFBB has shown that the homoclinic saddle points play a key\nFIG. 2. Details of the escape process: x is a point inside the\naccessible basin of attraction V1, fsxd is the noise-free image of x,\nand y is the point on the boundary dV that minimizes the \u201cenergy\u201d\ncost; y* is another snonoptimald point in V2 sthe set of all points in\nthe space is inaccessible from V1d.

In the system s1d, we observe an infinite\nsequence of saddle-node bifurcations of period 3, 4, 5, 6,\n7,\u2026, at parameter values d3,d4,d5,d6,d7fl, caused by\ntangencies of the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle\npoint O at the origin. The homoclinic orbits appearing as a\nresult of these bifurcations were classified earlier as original\nsaddles, and it was also shown that their stable and unstable\nmanifolds cross each other in a hierarchical sequence f29g. It\nis this deterministic structure of the manifolds of the original\nsaddles that determines the fluctuational escape mechanism\nacross the LD FBB. Indeed, to escape from a CA, the system\nmust first cross the stable manifold of the accessible orbit,\nand then the stable manifolds of the other original saddles, in\na predetermined hierarchical sequence. Once the system\ncrosses the stable manifold of a saddle orbit, it relaxes noise-\nfree to the corresponding orbit, which it then leaves along its\nunstable manifold. Therefore, the hierarchical interrelation\nbetween original saddles involved in the escape has to be\nclosely linked to eigenvalues of the Jacobian at these saddles\nsalso known as multipliers of the periodic orbit f46gd, char-\nacterizing their local stability with respect to motion on the\nmanifolds.\nTo quantify this interrelation, we introduce a parameter\nm =\nlog rstsxid\nlog runsxid\n, s9d\nwhere rstsxid and runsxid are the multipliers of the saddle\npoint xi corresponding to the stable and unstable directions,\nrespectively. This conclusion accords with the fact that the\nnatural measure h on a two-dimensional chaotic nonattract-\ning set is concentrated along its unstable manifold and can be\nrepresented via unstable eigenvalues of unstable orbits:\nhsCd=o1\/ log runsxid, where C is the region of phase space\ncontaining the chaotic saddle, runsxid is the multiplier corre-\nsponding to the unstable manifold, and the summation is\nover all the unstable orbits xi in C f47g scf. f48gd. Calcula-\ntions have shown that, for the original saddles of periods 3,\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\u2026 in Eq. s1d, the following hierarchical sequence\nof index m values occurs: m3=3.339, m4=3.080, m5=2.999,\nm6=2.339, m7=1.958, and m8=1.539. Moreover, the values\nof m corresponding to the other homoclinic saddle cycles are\nclose to zero. Correspondingly, the probability of finding the\nsystem in their neighborhood tends to zero. Our studies of\nthe effect of noise on this deterministic structure proceeded\nvia analysis of relaxational trajectories inside the LD FBB.\nThey have shown that homoclinic tangle is robust to noise-\ninduced perturbations: the addition of noise caused only a\nsmall increase in the probability for the system to escape via\nsaddle cycles of large period, increasing the time of wander-\ning inside the homoclinic tangle f23g.\nIII. FLUCTUATIONAL TRANSITIONS AND \u201cFRACTAL-\nFRACTAL0 BASIN BOUNDARY CRISIS\nA. Henon map\nTo illustrate the above mechanism of transition across the\nLD FBB, let us consider the situation when the heteroclinic\nchain shown in Fig. 3 is broken, for instance, between the\nsaddles of period 3 and 4. Such a situation leads to the so-\ncalled \u201cfractal-fractal\u201d boundary metamorphosis of the LD\nFBB observed for the first time in the Henon map,\nxn+1 = A \u2212 xn\n2\n\u2212 Jyn + jn\n1\n, s10d\nyn+1 = xn + jn\n2\n,\nwhich we treated as a model excited by two statistically in-\ndependent Gaussian noise sources whose correlation func-\ntions are kj\nn\ns1,2dj\nm\ns1,2dl=2Ddnm. It is well known that the noise-\nfree system s10d is of a generic character, and that it can\ndemonstrate a rich variety of bifurcations and basin transfor-\nmations. In particular, the \u201cfractal-fractal\u201d basin boundary\nmetamorphosis which manifests itself as a sudden jump of\nthe basin boundary inwards, into the open neighborhood con-\ntaining the attractor, is observed for certain values of control\nparameters f29g. In our studies, we fixed parameter J=0.3\nand varied parameter A within the range 1.38\u0142A\u01421.405. As\ncan be seen from Fig. 4sad, the basin boundary separating the\nbasin of attraction of the stable orbit from the basin of attrac-\ntion of infinity is fractal for A=1.38; its fractal dimension is\n1.53. There exists an accessible boundary point of period 4\nsS4d, whose stable manifold detaches the open neighborhood\nfrom the LD FBB. The unstable manifold of the accessible\npoint S4 has two branches. One of these slices through the\nbasin boundary at a Cantor set of points, while the other lies\nentirely in the open neighborhood and does not touch the\nstable manifold of the same accessible boundary point until\nthe crisis. At the value A>1.396 where it becomes tangent\nand then crosses the stable manifold, the saddle point S4\nceases to be the accessible orbit leading to the crisis of the\nLD FBB and causing the observed sudden jump of the\nboundary inside the white region fsee Fig. 4sbdg. At the same\nvalue, the unstable manifold of the saddle point of period 3\nFIG. 3. Illustration of the hierarchical heteroclinic intersections\nbetween the stable and unstable manifolds of the original saddles.\nThe units are dimensionless.\nFLUCTUATIONAL TRANSITIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 046203 s2005d\n046203-5\nsS3d, lying inside the white region, crosses the stable mani-\nfold of the saddle S4 and joins the homoclinic structure\nforming the LD FBB. After the transition, the saddle point S3\nbecomes an accessible boundary point, whereas the point S4\nbecomes buried in the basin boundary. The exchange of ac-\ncessible orbits is the essence of the \u201cfractal-fractal9 boundary\nmetamorphosis f29g.\nNow, let us consider noise-induced escape through the LD\nFBB in the system s10d for the control parameter value A\n=1.38, preceding the \u201cfractal-fractal\u201d boundary crisis. As we\nalready mentioned above, the saddle point S3 lies inside the\nbasin of attraction of C2 whose unstable manifold also lies\nentirely inside that basin. To find the optimal escape path, we\nused the same technique as before, monitoring the system\ns10d all the time during the iteration process and collecting\nboth the escape trajectories and the corresponding realiza-\ntions of noise inducing the fluctuational transitions from C2\nto infinity. An analysis of the collected escape trajectories\nshows that escape always occurs via the saddle point S3 and\nthe accessible boundary point S4. Points forming the optimal\nescape path from C2 to the LD FBB are shown in Fig. 5sad.\nTo understand why escape trajectories always pass through\nS3, which does not belong to the boundary, we calculated its\nstable manifold which, as seen from Fig. 5sad, lies entirely\ninside the basin of C2 and is positioned closer to the attractor\nthan the LD FBB. For this reason, the only way for the\nsystem s10d to reach LD FBB is to cross, first, the stable\nmanifold of the saddle S3 and then, second, move to the LD\nFBB crossing it at accessible boundary point S4.\nTo find the MPEP in the limit of D\u21920, we repeated the\nprocedure described in Sec. II for the following enlarged\nsystem:\nxn+1 = A \u2212 xn\n2\n\u2212 Jyn + ln\nx\n,\nyn+1 = xn + ln\ny\n,\nln+1\nx\n= ln\ny\n,\nln+1\ny\n= \u2212 sln\nx + 2xnln\nyd\/J , s11d\nconsidering as boundary conditions the stable point C2 and\nthe accessible boundary point S4. The results of our calcula-\ntions are presented in Fig. 5sad. The MPEP starting from C2\nreaches, first, the saddle point S3 and then goes to the LD\nFBB, crossing it at the point S4. Further relaxation does not\nrequire any external force and is governed by the homoclinic\ntangle. Its hierarchical structure is characterized by the fol-\nlowing values of the parameter m: m3=3.5076, m4=2.7699,\nm5=2.5396, and m6=2.3898. It is clearly seen from Fig. 5\nthat the MPEP coincides with the optimal escape path com-\nputed from the Monte Carlo simulations. Thus, there are two\nheteroclinic trajectories in the phase space of the system s12d\nconnecting points C2 and S4. The first one connects the\nsaddle points C2 and S3, while the second one connects S3\nand S4. Thus it seems that, in the presence of noise, the\nsaddle point S3 starts to play the role of an accessible bound-\nary point instead of S4.\nWe also calculated the optimal fluctuational force moving\nour system to the LD FBB for two different values of the\ncontrol parameter A corresponding to the states before and\nafter the \u201cfractal-fractal\u201d boundary crisis. The results of our\ncalculations are presented in Fig. 5sbd.

Duffing oscillator\nA similar situation is observed for the periodically driven\nDuffing oscillator excited by white Gaussian noise,\nx\u00a8 + Gx\u02d9 \u2212 ax + bx3 = A cos Vt + \u02db2Djstd , s12d\nwhere G is the coefficient of dissipation, a and b are param-\neters defining the shape of a potential, A and V are the am-\nplitude and frequency of external force, and D is the intensity\nof the noise jstd. It is known that for some values of control\nparameters, the noise-free system s12d can demonstrate the\nsame type of boundary crisis as the Henon map considered\nabove. Using the same technique as before, we calculated the\noptimal escape paths for the two different values of the driv-\ning amplitude corresponding to the states before and after the\n\u201cfractal-fractal\u201d boundary crisis. The results of our calcula-\ntions are pictured in Fig. 6. As is clearly seen from this\nfigure, the system s12d moves to the FBB via saddle points\nS3 and S4 before the crisis, while after that it jumps via point\nS3 only. The close correspondence between results obtained\nfor the two different kinds of systems allows us to conclude\nthat, under the influence of noise, the saddle point S3 ac-\nquires the features of an accessible boundary point. How-\never, this saddle point does not belong to the FBB. This fact\ndoes not allow us to claim that weak noise can induce a\n\u201cfractal-fractal\u201d boundary crisis. However, taking into ac-\ncount the significant influence of S3 on the escape process,\nwe may speak about a noisy precursor of the crisis on the LD\nFBB, which manifests itself in observed structure of the op-\ntimal escape path.\nWe remind the reader that the notion of a noisy precursor\nwas originally introduced by Wiesenfield f49g during studies\nof noisy dynamical systems near bifurcations. It is well\nknown that dynamical systems are very sensitive to fluctua-\ntions near a bifurcation point. It was shown that even weak\nnoise is able to induce the appearance of additional peaks in\na power spectrum of response of a noisy dynamical system\nindicating its proximity to the bifurcation point. It is also\nknown that the response of a dynamical system near bifur-\ncation can be characterized by a bell-shaped dependence of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio on the noise intensity. It is this fact\nthat allows one to speak of coherence resonance at the noisy\nprecursor of a bifurcation f50g. However, all previous studies\nwere concerned with the different bifurcations of attractors\nthemselves, whereas in many real situations dynamical insta-\nbilities can also be caused by bifurcations of the basins of\nattraction f51g. Our above results clearly show that analysis\nof the structure of the optimal escape paths allows us to draw\na conclusion about the presence of an instability caused by\nbifurcation of the basin boundary.\nIV. FLUCTUATIONAL TRANSITIONS\nACROSS AN LC FBB\nWe now consider the same escape problem, but in an\nsystem possessing a LC FBB. This type of FBB is generally\nobserved in two-dimensional noninvertible analytic and\nnonanalytic maps f4,52g. We will take as our model a typical\nnonanalytic quadratic map driven by noise,\nxn+1 = xn\n2\n\u2212 yn\n2 + axn + jn\n1\n,\nyn+1 = 2xnyn + axn + byn + jn\n2\n, s13d\nwhere jn\n1\n, jn\n2 are statistically independent sources of white,\nGaussian noise of zero mean that are of equal intensity D.\nFor the chosen values of the control parameters a=0.7, b\n=0.5, this map has stable points at the origin and at infinity,\nseparated by the LC FBB. The boundary contains an infinite\nset of repelling points and no saddle points. It is the Julia set\nhomeomorphic to a circle. To find the boundary condition on\nthe LC FBB and the optimal escape path, we use exactly the\nsame technique as in the case of the LD FBB, above. The\nresults of our calculations are presented in Fig. 7. As can\nclearly be seen from this figure, the system s13d leaves the\nstable point O at the origin along a unique optimal escape\npath and approaches the LC FBB at the unique point shown\nin Fig. 7sad. Moreover, our calculations have shown that the\noptimal fluctuational force fsee Fig. 7sbdg becomes equal to\nzero at this moment.\nFIG. 7. sad The locally connected FBB ssolid closed curved,\nunstable node of period 9 scrossesd, and points on the optimal es-\ncape path obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations sfilled circlesd\nwith D=5310\u22123.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 046203 s2005d\n046203-8\nAccording to our previous results, this means that the sys-\ntem s13d reached the boundary at this point, and its further\nrelaxation to infinity is noise-free and completely specified\nby the deterministic structure of the FBB. Our calculations\nhave shown that the boundary point A corresponds exactly to\nthe repelling boundary point of period 9, which plays the role\nof the unique boundary condition on this LC FBB. Moreover,\nour studies have shown that this repelling point plays the role\nof the boundary condition over a wide range of the control\nparameters a and b. Note that noise-induced escape from the\nattractor surrounded by an LC FBB in Eq. s13d was consid-\nered earlier in the pioneering work of Grassberger f15g, who\nsucceeded in calculating the optimal escape path, albeit with-\nout finding the boundary condition on the LC FBB or the\nmechanism of escape.\nTo find the MPEP, we treated the following enlarged sys-\ntem:\nxn+1 = xn\n2\n\u2212 yn\n2 + axn + ln\nx\n,\nyn+1 = 2xnyn + axn + byn + ln\ny\n,\nln+1\nx\n= fs2xn + bdln\nx + 2ynlng\/A ,\nln+1\ny\n= f\u2212 s2yn + adln\nx + s2xn + adln\nyg\/A , s14d\nsupplemented by the boundary conditions at the steady point\nO and at the repeller of period 9. Here A= s2xn+ads2xn\n+bd+2yns2yn+ad is the determinant of the Jacobian written\nfor the system s13d. As is seen from Fig. 7sad, the MPEP\ncoincides almost perfectly with the optimal path obtained\nfrom the Monte Carlo simulations.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied fluctuational transitions between coexist-\ning regular attractors separated by both LD and LC FBBs.\nWe have shown that an accessible point on the FBB plays the\nrole of a unique boundary condition for both types of FBB.\nOur statistical analyses of fluctuational trajectories have\nyielded solutions of the boundary-value problem for both\ntypes of FBB, and have revealed the optimal fluctuational\nforces moving the systems s1d and s13d from one attractor to\nthe other. We were also able to find the unique optimal es-\ncape path in both cases. The original saddles forming the\nhomoclinic structure of the system s1d play a key role in the\nformation of the escape paths inside the LD FBB, and the\ndifference in their local stability defines the hierarchical re-\nlationship between them. We have also considered fluctua-\ntional transitions in a dynamical system exhibiting a \u201cfractal-\nfractal\u201d boundary crisis. It is shown that noise can effectively\nmove the accessible boundary point inside the domain of\nattraction, giving rise to a noisy precursor of the boundary\ncrisis that manifests itself in the structure of the optimal es-\ncape path. We have generalized the notion of a noisy precur-\nsor to the case of a bifurcation of the basin boundary. The\nresults obtained can be applied directly to the other maps and\nflows having the same type of FBB.\nWe emphasize that similar behavior is expected for fluc-\ntuational transitions between chaotic attractors separated by\nFBBs f23g. It has therefore become possible to predict a\nscenario of escape through a fractal boundary using a deter-\nministic analysis of the FBB structure. Furthermore, recent\nresults f22g have shown that the boundary conditions at cha-\notic attractors can also be related to the homoclinic structure,\nand thus found deterministically. Among a variety of pos-\nsible applications, we would mention a new method of chaos\ncontrol in the presence of fluctuations that can now be de-\nveloped f53g.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge fruitful discussions with\nMark Dykman, Ulrike Feudel, Igor Khovanov, Suso Kraut,\nEdson Leonel, and Stanislav Soskin.
