The properties of second sound in\nHe-II have been studied extensively, both experimentally and theoretically over\nmany years. More recently, attention has been focused on the nonlinear acoustic\nproperties of He-II3,4,5. It is known1,2,6,7 that second sound is characterised by\nstrong nonlinear properties. As a result of this nonlinearity, a propagating roton\nsecond sound pulse even of the quite small amplitude \u03b4T \u223c 1 mK transforms into\na shock wave over a relatively small distance L\u223c 1 cm from the source8.\nThe velocity u2 of second sound depends on its amplitude and, to a first ap-\nproximation, can be written as\nu2 = u20(1+\u03b1\u03b4T ) (1)\n1:Department of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YB, UK\n2:Institute of Solid State Physics RAS, 142432, Chernogolovka, Russia\nPublished in J. Low Temp. Phys. 150, 394-401 (2008).\n2where u20 is the wave velocity at negligibly small amplitude, \u03b4T is the wave am-\nplitude in temperature T ,\n\u03b1 =\n\u2202\n\u2202T ln\n(\nu320\nC\nT\n)\n,\nis the nonlinearity coefficient of second sound, and C is the heat capacity per unit\nmass of liquid helium at constant pressure.\nThe nonlinearity coefficient \u03b1 may be either positive or negative, depending on\nthe temperature and pressure1,7. Under the saturated vapour pressure, in the region\nof roton second sound (i.e. at T > 0.9 K) \u03b1 is positive (\u03b1 > 0) for T < T\u03b1 = 1.88\nK, just like the nonlinearity coefficient of conventional sound waves in ordinary\nmedia. However, it is negative (\u03b1 < 0) in the range T\u03b1 < T < T\u03bb . Here T\u03bb = 2.176\nK is the temperature of the superfluid-to-normal (He-II to He-I) transition under\nthe saturated vapour pressure. At T = T\u03b1 , \u03b1 passes through zero.\nSecond sound in He II within a high-Q resonator was recently used for an\nexperimental study of acoustic or Burgers turbulence (BT) in a system of nonlinear\nsound waves9. Note that this turbulent state is radically different from quantum\nturbulence10 (QT) in He II because the density of quantised vortices is close to\nzero. Furthermore, the motions of both the normal and superfluid components\ncan be considered as being to a first approximation potential. BT has been at the\nfocus of numerous investigations during the last few decades in view of its many\nimportant applications in engineering and fundamental science11,12,13.\nThere are huge advantages in the use of roton second sound waves for the\nstudy of BT, including: the possibility of adjusting the nonlinearity coefficient of\nthe second sound simply by changing the bath temperature, thus enabling one to\nstudy both nearly linear, and strongly nonlinear, waves while using exactly the\nsame experimental techniques; the excellent time-resolution of the measurements\ndue to the relatively small velocity of the second sound u20 \u2264 20 m\/s; and the\nease with which the spectral characteristics of the driving force can be adjusted\nby changing the electrical signal applied to the heater used to generate the second\nsound.\nIt has been established9 that a steady-state Kolmogorov-like wave energy cas-\ncade of acoustic turbulence can be formed in He II. It involves a flux of energy\nthrough the spectral range towards high frequencies, and arises when a periodic\ndriving force of sufficiently high amplitude is applied at one of the resonant fre-\nquencies of the cavity. There is a smooth crossover in the system of second sound\nwaves from the nearly linear regime at low driving amplitudes, to a nonlinear\nregime and, further, to developed turbulence at high driving amplitudes.\nHere we demonstrate that acoustic waves with frequency lower than the driv-\ning frequency can also be generated due to nonlinearity. We report also the initial\nresults of a study of the influence of an additional low-frequency periodic driving\nforce on the steady-state turbulent energy distribution. We find that the application\nof a weak low-frequency perturbation to the turbulent system leads to the excita-\ntion of additional degrees of freedom \u2013 standing waves with frequencies equal\nto combinations of the main and additional driving frequencies. A redistribution\nof wave energy between the newly excited states leads to a decrease in the am-\nplitudes of the nonlinearly generated waves in the high-frequency domain of the\nspectrum. We comment that turbulence \u201cdamping\u201d on switching on the additional\n3energy input at low frequencies may be useful, for example in the control14 of\nturbulence.\n2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n2.1 Experimental Techniques\nThe experimental arrangements were similar to those used earlier9 for the study of\nacoustic turbulence excited by a periodic driving force. We use a thin-film heater\nto generate the second sound, and a thin-film thermometer (a superconducting\nbolometer) as a detector. Use of a high-Q resonator enables us to create nonlinear\nsecond sound standing waves of high amplitude with only small heat production\nat the source. The wave amplitude \u03b4T can be changed from 0.05 mK up to a few\nmK. The resonator was formed by a cylindrical quartz tube of length L = 7 cm\nand inner diameter D = 1.5 cm. The film heater and bolometer were deposited on\nthe surfaces of flat glass plates capping the ends of the tube. The measurements\nreported below were conducted under the saturated vapour pressure at T = 2.08 K\nwhere \u03b1 \u2248\u22127.6 K\u22121. The Q-factor of the resonator, determined from the widths\nof longitudinal resonances at small heat flux densities, was Q\u223c 1000 for resonance\nnumbers p\u2264 10 and Q\u223c 3000 for 30 < p < 100.\nIn the present experiments, the heater could be driven by either or both of two\nexternal sinusoidal voltage generators in the frequency range between 0.1 and 100\nkHz. When driving simultaneously at two frequencies the voltage applied to the\nheater was equal to\nU(t) = U1 cos(\u03c91t +\u03d51)+U2 cos(\u03c92t +\u03d52). (2)\nThe heat flux density emitted by the heater is proportional to the square of the\nvoltage U(t) applied to the heater,\nW (t) = U2(t)\/RS, (3)\nwhere R and S are resistance and area of the heater. In the measurements reported\nbelow we applied a low-frequency driving force with \u03c92 < \u03c91 and U2 < U1. In\norder to drive at a single frequency \u03c91, the driving voltage U2 was set to zero, in\nwhich case only a standing wave of frequency \u03c9d1 = 2\u03c91 was excited.\nIf U1 and U2 are both nonzero then, in accordance with Eqs. 2 and 3, the fre-\nquencies of the excited second sound standing waves are equal to \u03c9d1 = 2\u03c91,\n\u03c9d2 = 2\u03c92, and \u03c9d3,4 = \u03c91\u00b1\u03c92. Two types of measurements were conducted in\nthe latter case. In each of them the main driving frequency \u03c9d1 was always set\nequal to one of the longitudinal resonant frequencies of the cavity. In measure-\nments of the first type second sound waves were excited by pumping effectively\nat the single frequency \u03c9d1: the additional driving frequency \u03c9d2 was set far from\nany resonant frequency (typically, \u03c9d2 \u223c 1 Hz), and, hence, the amplitudes of the\nsecond sound waves excited at the additional frequencies \u03c9d2, \u03c9d3 and \u03c9d4 were\nnegligibly small due to high quality of the resonator. In measurements of the sec-\nond type, the frequency \u03c9d2 was set equal to some resonant frequency of the cav-\nity. In this case second sound waves were excited simultaneously at four resonant\nfrequencies \u03c9d1, \u03c9d2, \u03c9d3 and \u03c9d4. In both cases the bolometer signal A(t) was\n41 10\n10-10\n10-6\n10-2\n1 10\n10-10\n10-6\n10-2\nwd1\n \n \nE w\n, a\n.u\n.\na)\nb)\nwd1 wd1\n \nE w\n, a\n.u\n.\nFrequency, kHz\n \nFrequency, kHz\n\/2\nwd1\/2\nFig. 1 Energy spectra of standing second sound waves measured at T = 2.08 K when driving at\na single frequency of the 32nd resonance.

The main driving frequency is \u03c9d1\/2pi = 4020.6 Hz; the additional\ndriving frequency is \u03c9d2\/2pi = 858.3 Hz. The inset at the plate (b) shows an enlarged part of the\nspectrum near the 2nd harmonic of \u03c9d1 in semi-log scale.\n6It is seen in Fig. 1(a) that spectral peaks are created at frequency \u03c9d1 and its\nharmonics, similarly to our earlier observation9. Formation of the spectrum is at-\ntributable to a cascade transfer of wave energy through the frequency scales due to\nnonlinearity, thus establishing an energy flux in K-space directed from the driving\nfrequency towards the high-frequency domain, and, hence, an acoustic turbulent\nstate in the system of second sound waves (see Refs.11,12,15 for general theory).\nAt such a small ac heat flux density the amplitude of the wave of frequency equal\nto half the driving frequency, \u03c9d1\/2 = \u03c91, is negligibly small and is comparable\nwith the amplitude of electrical noise.\nAt high driving voltage, however, formation of a peak at the frequency equal\nto half the driving frequency \u03c9d1\/2 is clearly seen in Fig. 1(b). Its amplitude is\nof the same order as the amplitude of fundamental peak at \u03c9d1. Generation of\nthis subharmonic is probably caused by nonlinear three-wave processes in which\na wave of frequency \u03c9d1 decays into two waves with frequencies \u03c9d1\/2 due to\na parametric instability11, i.e. by the nonlinear process opposite to confluence of\ntwo waves, which causes generation of high frequency harmonics. We found that\nthe peak at frequency \u03c9d1\/2 was not observed when driving at frequencies of\nthe nearest resonances with odd resonant numbers (31st, etc), that supports our\ninference. As mentioned earlier9, excitation of a subharmonic of the driving fre-\nquency leads to an effective decrease of the inertial interval of frequencies where\nthe turbulent spectrum is established.\nFigure 2 presents some typical experimental results obtained when driving si-\nmultaneously at two frequencies (U1 and U2 both being nonzero). The ac heat flux\ndensity at the main driving frequency \u03c9d1 was W1 = 21.5 mW\/cm2, and the ac\nheat flux densities at the additional driving frequencies were W2 = 0.16W1 = 3.4\nmW\/cm2 at the frequency \u03c9d2 and W3,4 = 0.8W1 = 17.2 mW\/cm2 at the frequen-\ncies \u03c9d3 and \u03c9d4.\nFig. 2(a) shows the steady-state energy spectrum of second sound waves mea-\nsured when driving effectively at a single frequency of the 40th resonance (mea-\nsurements of the first type). It is evident from Fig. 2(a) that the fundamental spec-\ntral peak lies at the driving frequency \u03c9d1, and a subharmonic peak of comparable\namplitude lies at half the driving frequency \u03c9d1\/2. The high-frequency peaks ap-\npear at harmonics of both the fundamental driving frequency and its subharmon-\nics, \u03c9n = n\u00d7\u03c9d1\/2 with n = 1,2,3 . . ..\nFig. 2(b) shows the spectrum obtained in a measurement of the second type,\nwhen the driving frequency \u03c9d2 was set equal to the 9th resonant frequency, in\naddition to the main drive. The frequencies \u03c9d3,4 lay far from any longitudi-\nnal resonance of the cavity, and waves with these frequencies were not excited.\nIt is clearly seen that additional peaks are formed at combination frequencies\n\u03c9mn = m\u00d7\u03c9d1 + n\u00d7\u03c9d2 (where n and m are integer numbers) along with har-\nmonics of the main driving frequency. These peaks are evidently formed through\nnonlinear interactions between the waves at the main and additional driving fre-\nquencies. This phenomenon is similar to the generation of combination frequen-\ncies during the propagation of light through a nonlinear optical medium16. For-\nmation of Stokes and anti-Stokes satellites of the 2nd harmonics of the main drive\nat frequencies \u03c9 = 2\u03c9d1\u00b1\u03c9d2, corresponding to \u201cabsorption\u201d and \u201cemission\u201d of\nthe second sound waves with frequency \u03c9d2 due to nonlinearity, is clearly seen in\nthe spectrum shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b).\n71 10 100\n10-7\n10-4\n10-1\n102\nwd2 wd1\n \n \nE w\n, a\n.u\n.\nResonance number\nFig. 3 Calculated energy distributions of nonlinear second sound waves.

The low-frequency ac heat flux density W2 is equal to 0.1\u00d7 the ac\nheat flux density W1 at the main driving frequency.\nIt is evident from Fig. 2 that the inertial interval of frequencies is reduced by\napplication of the additional driving force to the system: the characteristic fre-\nquency \u03c9 \u2032\/2pi , at which the peaks fall below the electrical noise level (\u223c 10 a.u.)\nis decreased from \u223c 110 kHz in Fig. 2(a) to \u223c 82 kHz in Fig. 2(b). Note that a\nvery similar effect \u2013 reduction of the high-frequency oscillations by application\nof an additional low-frequency perturbation to a turbulent system \u2013 was recently\nobserved in experiments with capillary waves on the surface of liquid hydrogen17.\n2.3 Numerical Calculations\nTo try to understand how the application of a low frequency perturbation affects\nthe turbulent distribution, we have performed a numerical study of the dynam-\nics of nonlinear second-sound waves within the high-Q resonator. The numerical\ntechnique was similar to that used earlier in studies of the formation of steady-\nstate turbulent second sound spectra9. Figure 3 shows the calculated changes in\nthe steady-state energy spectrum of second sound after switching on the low-\nfrequency perturbation. We assumed that the main driving force is applied at the\n6th resonant frequency and that the additional driving force is applied at the 5th\nresonant frequency. It is clearly evident that application of a small perturbation\nwith W2 \u223c 0.1W1 (i.e. not much different from the ratio of 0.16 used in the exper-\niments) leads to the formation of waves with frequencies equal to combinations\nof the driving force frequencies and to a substantial reduction in wave amplitude\nat frequencies above the main driving frequency. Generation of waves with fre-\nquencies lower than \u03c9d2, i.e. the 1st, 2nd, etc, resonances, as seen in Fig. 3 (open\n8circles), is caused by excitation of combination frequencies of the main and ad-\nditional drive, \u03c9d1\u2212\u03c9d2 and its harmonics. Numerical estimation shows that the\ntotal wave energy Ehf contained in the high frequency domain (waves with reso-\nnance numbers p \u2265 7) is decreased by \u223c 4\u00d7 after the additional driving force is\napplied. The reason for the damping of the high-frequency turbulent cascade is\nprobably an outflow of energy from the high-frequency spectral domain towards\nthe low-frequency energy-containing domain after application of the perturbation.\nWe plan to study this phenomenon in detail in the near future.\n3 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown in experiments with a turbulent system of second sound waves\nin a high-Q resonator filled with superfluid helium that acoustic waves with fre-\nquency lower than the driving frequency may be generated due to nonlinearity:\na sound wave with frequency equal to half the driving frequency (subharmonic\nof the driving frequency) may be excited at relatively large ac heat flux densi-\nties. We suppose that the subharmonic is generated through a decay instability of\nthe wave excited by an external drive. We have also found in both experiments\nand numerical calculations that application of an additional low frequency driving\nforce to a turbulent system of second sound waves results in the excitation of addi-\ntional acoustic oscillations with frequencies equal to combination frequencies of\nthe main and additional driving forces. The amplitudes of the second sound waves\nin the high frequency spectral domain are decreased when the additional driving\nforce is applied. Suppression of the turbulent cascade in the high-frequency do-\nmain is probably caused by redistribution of the wave energy among newly excited\nstates in the low-frequency energy-containing region.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to V.
