This paper \nspeculates on what happens to cultural politics when enchanted modernities are seen to \nencompass ghosts and ghost stories and considers the political possibilities of \nspecifically modern enchantments that have the power to enchant and disenchant \nsimultaneously. The paper first examines the ways in which understandings of both \nenchantment and modernity have changed over time and, in particular, the impact of \npostcolonial theory on reconceptualising the relationship between the two. It then uses a \nghost story encountered in fieldwork in South Africa to illustrate how the figures of \nghosts and spirits can cast light on the lived experiences of postcolonial modernities. The \npaper contends that while ghost stories do not necessarily fit with more optimistic \npolitics of enchantment, in the South African context they can represent active political \nengagement and produce positive political effect, rather than simply disenchanting those \nmodernities that produce them. The paper concludes that an alternative approach is \nrequired to navigate between an overly cynical politics that works to disenchant the \nworld and more optimistic accounts that focus on the ethical possibilities of \nenchantment. This necessitates a close reading of how modernities are enchanted in \nparticular places and to what political effect. \n \n 3 \nIntroduction  \nGhosts, spectres and spirits and the stories told about them have long been a source of \nintellectual inquiry\n1\n. As Gordon (1997) argues, ghosts are one form by which something \nlost, or barely visible, or seemingly not there, makes itself known or apparent. While \nghost stories are inventions, often about things that never happened, or metaphors for \notherwise inexplicable presences, feelings or events, their meaning, power and the \npassion with which they are told or withheld are significant (White, 1993; see also \nComaroff and Comaroff, 1999). Moreover, ghosts and ghost stories are deeply \nembedded in the cultural politics of postcolonial modernities. From attempts to re-\nconceptualise freedom and postcolonial nationality through the figure of the spectre \n(Cheah, 2004), to explorations of the role of sorcery in democracy in Indonesia \n(Bubandt, 2006), accounts of industrial ghosts in factual and fictional accounts of \nMalaysian components factories (Ong, 1987; Chua, 1998), invocations of spectres in \nstudies of overseas Filipino migration (Rafael, 1997) and stories of ghosts and spirit \npossessions from Papua New Guinea to India (for example, Wardlow, 2002; \nUchiyamada, 1999) ghosts, it seems, are everywhere in scholarly discourse. It is striking, \ntherefore, that spectres, spirits and the stories told about them appear largely absent from \nmany recent debates about enchantment and modernity (cf. Pile, 2005).  \n                                                          \n1\n The list is endless, but for examples in anthropology see Klenk, 2004; Taussig, 1980; \nWeller, 1994; West, 2001; in sociology\/psychology: Gordon, 1997; in feminism: Daly, \n1978; Thomas 1991; in cultural history: Marcus, 1999; in geography: Pile, 2005. \n 4 \nThe scholarly apparatus of metropolitan cultural politics has increasingly turned \ntowards the question of enchantment. Poststructuralism and postcolonialism, in \nparticular, have brought dominant, western understandings of modernity into question \nand, in turn, have reinvigorated interest in the idea of enchantment. Enchantment is both \nambiguous and ambivalent and rarely is it defined with any great precision, one reason \nbeing that it is a complex and inherently vague term, the meaning and discursive use of \nwhich has changed over time. Despite this, \u201ere-enchantment\u201f has recently become a \npolitical end in itself, not simply within celebrations of non-rationalism, but in terms of a \nmore profound dialogue between Western social theory and \u201cOther\u201d knowledges (Zaidi, \n2006), in fostering an ethical engagement with the world (Bennett, 2001) and as a means \nof building a new politics of solidarity (Amin, 2006). Characterizing modernity as \ndisenchanted is seen as both discouraging affective attachment to the world and \nrestricting how the world is understood and imagined. As Chakrabarty (2000: 89) argues, \n\u201cThe moment we think of the world as disenchanted\u2026 we set limits to the ways the past \n[and present] can be narrated\u201d. Enchantment is thus perceived as a basis for an optimistic \ncultural politics. \nThis optimism tends to rely on the largely positive workings of enchantment, on \ncharm, awe, wonder and a child-like excitement about life. However, enchantment \nencompasses a much wider range of emotions and affects; as Bennett herself argues, \nenchantment can also be a state of fear and the sense of wonder associated with it may \narise from a \u201cmore unheimlich (uncanny) feeling of being disrupted or torn out of one\u201fs \ndefault sensory-psychic-intellectual disposition\u201d (2001: 5). Similarly, Schneider (1993: \n2-3) suggests, \n 5 \nWe become enchanted\u2026 when we are confronted by circumstances or \noccurrences so peculiar and so beyond our present understanding as to leave us \nconvinced that, were they to be understood, our image of how the world operates \nwould be radically transformed. \nTo be enchanted, then, is not always to be delighted or charmed, but to be faced with \nsomething both real and simultaneously weird, mysterious, awesome and perhaps even \ndreadful. Enchantment can be a state in which ghosts, spirits and spectres exist within a \nm\u00e9lange of other marvels, including magic, myth, monsters, witchcraft, sorcery, voodoo, \nvampires and zombies (Saler, 2006). Such marvels are no longer thought to have been \nexorcised by the rational and secular processes of modernity; far from being extraneous \nto modernity, they are intrinsic to what are increasingly recognised as thoroughly \nenchanted modernities. Against this backdrop, this paper speculates on what happens to \ncultural politics when enchanted modernities are seen to encompass these darker \nmarvels. Through a focus on ghosts and ghost stories, it considers the political \npossibilities of specifically modern enchantments that have the power to enchant and \ndisenchant simultaneously \u2013 to inspire awe, fear or dread but not necessarily to delude. \nThe paper begins by examining the ways in which understandings of both \nenchantment and modernity have changed over time and, in particular, the impact of \npostcolonial theory on reconceptualising the relationship between the two. It suggests \nthat while postcolonialism has played a fundamental role in dismantling western-centric \nnotions of modernity as disenchanted and, in turn, has influenced the recent shift within \ncultural politics towards enchantment, this shift remains problematically western-centric \nin focus and ignores the particularities of enchanted modernities in non-metropolitan \n 6 \ncontexts. In contrast, by drawing on fieldwork in South Africa, I illustrate how the \nfigures of ghosts and spirits can cast light on the lived experiences of postcolonial \nmodernities. The conditions of postcoloniality in South Africa, characterised by rapid \nsocial, political and cultural change alongside increasing \u201emodernisation\u201f, neo-\nliberalisation and globalisation, have produced very particular forms of enchantment \n(including ghosts and other spectral presences) that are also deeply politicised responses \nto change.\n2\n The paper contends that while ghost stories do not necessarily fit with more \noptimistic politics of enchantment, in the South African context they can represent active \npolitical engagement and produce positive political effect, rather than simply \ndisenchanting those modernities that produce them.  \nThis contention is illustrated by a ghost story encountered in Cape Town, the \nmeanings of which I attempt to unravel by drawing on current debates in political theory \nand anthropology. Through this example, I suggest that the prevalence of ghosts and the \nstories told about them cannot be understood entirely through recourse to the \n                                                          \n2\n There is, of course, scope for exploring the presence of ghosts and other spirits in \ncontexts where they are also prominent. However, in other postcolonial contexts ghosts \nare often a product of history and mythology (e.g. Arana, 2001 on Peru), or part of \npopular folklore and spirit belief (e.g. Skeat, 1902 and Chou, 2002 on Malaysia), or an \ninherent part of syncretic cultures with origins in traditional spiritualism (e.g. Haitian or \nLouisianan voodoo; see Pile, 2005). However, this paper is concerned with ghosts that \nhave appeared recently in South Africa and that appear to be the product of very specific \nmodernities. \n 7 \ndisenchanted\/disenchanting politics of modernity that scholars such as Bennett so \nfervently reject. Nor, however, do recent accounts of the political and ethical \npossibilities of re-enchantment account for the burgeoning rise in the occult within \npostcolonial modernities. Rather, an alternative approach is required, one that \nnecessitates a close reading of how modernities are enchanted in particular places and to \nwhat political effect. \n \nThe politics of enchanted modernities  \nThe meaning of enchantment is both fluid and ambiguous. It has been used since \nmedieval times, for example, to signify both delight in wonders and the possibility of \nbeing deluded by them. From the Enlightenment enchantment was defined more \nnarrowly by elites as a form of duplicity associated with religious dogma and \nmonarchical rule (Saler, 2006). More recent accounts in political theory define \nenchantment primarily as aesthetic experience: \u201cto be struck and shaken by the \nextraordinary that lives amid the familiar...,\u201d \u201ca state of wonder... a surprising \nencounter...\u201d (Bennett, 2001: 4-5). Similarly, modernity is also a deeply ambiguous term \nbut one characteristic that has been remarkably consistent since the eighteenth century is \nthe idea of it being \u201edisenchanted\u201f. Modernity and enchantment have been perceived to \nbe dichotomous in much of western theory. Rationalization and bureaucratization were \nseen as intrinsic to modernity and inimical to magical attitudes toward human existence \nthat had characterized medieval and early modern thought. The advent of modernity \ninsinuates the disenchantment of the world: \u201cthe progressive control of nature through \nscientific procedures of technology, and the inexorable demystification of enchantments \n 8 \nthrough powerful techniques of reason\u201d (Dube, 2002: 729).3 Of course, enchantments \ndid not disappear but were marginalised as subordinate and residual phenomena, \nassociated with \u201c\u201eprimitives\u201f, women, children and the lower classes\u201d (Saler, 2006: \nparagraph 11). \n In contrast to Weberian approaches that view processes of modernity as \ndisenchanted, dialectical approaches depict these processes as creating their own \nenchantments in the negative sense; the telos of progress is itself seen as a monumental \nenchantment of modernity. Marx\u201fs recourse to metaphors and similes of enchantment \n(spectres, ghosts, fetishes) is the most obvious example (Derrida, 1994), as is \nNietzsche\u201fs equation of western faith in reason and science with irrational belief that \nculminates in nihilism (Nietzsche, 1956). These enchantments extend from: \nthe immaculately imagined origins and ends of modernity, to the dense magic of \nmoney and markets, to novel mythologies of nation and empire, to hierarchical \noppositions between myth and history, ritual and rationality, East and West, and \ntradition and modernity (Dube, 2002: 729). \n                                                          \n3\n Weber (1992) most famously epitomised the griots of disenchantment, depicting \nhistory as having departed from an enchanted past en route to a disenchanted future. His \ngloomy image of the \u201eiron cage\u201f of reason echoed the fears of earlier romantics and was \nrepeated by cultural pessimists throughout the twentieth century. \n 9 \nIn dialectical approaches, the rational and secular claims of western modernity are \nglobalizing, oppressive and deluding enchantments.\n4\n \n Whilst much of western theory has followed either Weberian notions of the \ndisjuncture between enchantment and modernity or Marxian notions of their dialectical \nrelationship, this \u201c\u201eeither\/or\u201f logic\u201d has increasingly been rejected, primarily because \nmodernity is recognised as defined less by hierarchical binaries or dialectical \ntransformation than it is by contradictions and oppositions (Saler, 2006: paragraph 18). \nModernity is now understood as Janus-faced with enchantment always already intrinsic \nto it. Studies have demonstrated, for example, that enchantment and occultism were \nconstitutive of elements of modern Victorian British culture, whilst the \u201emodern\u201f was \nimplicit in the gestures and presumptions of the occult. New forms of occult spirituality \nand expressions of enchantment were particular articulations of \u201cthe diverse and often \nambiguous processes through which cultural modernity was constituted\u201d (Owen, 2004: \n16; see also Marcus, 2001; Saler, 2003). Technology, as a kind of creativity recognised \nas invention, is a form of enchantment with the power to cast spells over people (Gell, \n1999: 163).\n5\n Moreover, technologies of enchantment create enchanted spaces through \n                                                          \n4\n Arguably the most influential articulation of the dialectical approach to modernity and \nenchantment was Horkheimer and Adorno\u201fs Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947; repr. \n2000). \n5\n As Harrison (2006) argues, Gell\u201fs discussion of captivation is influenced in part by \nBenjamin\u201fs writings on technology and distraction in The Arcades Project, his \ndiscussion of the intoxication felt by the fl\u00e2neur walking the streets of nineteenth-century \n 10 \nthe ascription of a special quality to the inventiveness of human agency (Strathern, \n2001). Contemporary cities \u2013 archetypical sites of modernity \u2013 are simultaneously \nmodern and magical. As Pile (2005: 59) argues, while magic implies a superstitious or \nprimitive world-view, \u201cmagic itself consistently emerges from modern city life, as \npeople seek ways to improve their conditions and influence their futures\u201d. Far from \nbeing eviscerated in spaces of modernity, enchantment circulates through them, through \n\u201cthe ways that magic condenses and displaces \u201ethings\u201f\u201d and through \u201cthe networks of \naffect, meaning and power that radiate from magical practices\u201d (ibid.). Enchantment \nbrings with it a \u201csense of other-worldliness, of the hidden networks that constitute \nmodernity\u2026 of occult relations of modern\u2026life,\u201d which are powerful even as they are \nintangible (ibid. 60). Rather than \u201cslipping away with the resolute march of modernity\u201d, \nenchantment is \u201ceverywhere on the rise\u201d (Comaroff and Comaroff, 1998: 295).  \nThat the contemporary modern world cannot be experienced as enchanted is now \nthoroughly challenged and, in contrast to the alleged predominance of reason in the \nmodern world there is \u201ca greater acceptance of the imagination as a source of multiple \nyet finite meanings that enchant in their own way\u201d (Saler, 2006: paragraph 50). \nReconceptualising the relationship between modernity and enchantment has become \nsignificant not only in terms of cultural politics but also because it appears closer to the \nlived experience of their subjects. As Saler (ibid.: paragraph 21) contends: \n                                                                                                                                                                           \nParis, and the enchantment of the collector who is simultaneously lost and renewed \nwhile gazing at the collected object. See also Pinney and Thomas (2001). \n 11 \nThere are forms of enchantment compatible with, and even dependent upon, \nthose tenets of modernity usually seen as disenchanting the world, such as \nrationality and self-reflexivity\u2026 [A] specifically modern enchantment might be \ndefined as one that enchants and disenchants simultaneously: one that delights \nbut does not delude. \nThese meanings are experienced with ironic detachment and this acceptance of \n\u201ccontingent meanings\u201d and \u201cprovisional wonders\u201d (ibid.: paragraph 50) increases the \npossible sources of enchantment, including fictions and mass culture. Bennett (2001) \ntakes these arguments a step further, seeking the rehabilitation of enchantment for \npolitical purposes.  \nIn a challenge to Leftist counterstories of modernity that Bennett argues \ndisenchant the world, she weaves together accounts of \u201ca contemporary world sprinkled \nwith natural and cultural sites that have the power to \u201eenchant\u201f\u201d (ibid.: 3), telling stories \nof \u201cthe marvellous erupting amid the everyday\u201d (ibid.: 8). She suggests that although \nrevealing injustice, inequity and violence, counterstories too often erase the possibilities \nof a joyful attachment to the world and produce \u201can enervating cynicism\u201d (2001: 13). In \ncontrast, Bennett\u201fs primary concern is to tell a different counterstory that encourages an \nethical engagement with the world. She thus shares with Gibson-Graham (1996) a \nconcern with the ways in which cultural narratives that are deployed to describe the \nworld in turn shape that world, but seeks to develop this in a much more optimistic light \n(see also Thrift, 2005). Thus, she celebrates the enchanted materialism of even mass-\nproduced commodities as adding significance to human existence, in contrast to the \nfetishisation of commodities rendering labour invisible and negating meaning from \n 12 \nhumanity. Bennett is sensitive to the dangers of aestheticisation in constructing an \naffective ethics (ibid.: 10) but perceives the greater danger in viewing commodities in \nsuch a way that erases their embodied, historical, somatic, sonorous, emotive and \nintellectual engagements. She attempts to create a counterstory that, while \nacknowledging a world of inequity, poverty and violence, draws attention to \u201cmagical \nsites\u201d (ibid.: 8) that are also present in the world, offering small but essential elements in \ngenerating an affective force that might be used to propel a spirit of ethical generosity.  \nThis rethinking of the relationship between modernity and enchantment has \nundoubtedly been influenced by postmodern and, in particular, postcolonial scholarship. \nDepictions of modernity as disenchanted have been viewed within postcolonial \nperspectives as ideological, \u201ca useful conceptual tool for Western colonial purposes that \nobscured the tensions and contradictions within the modern world\u201d (Saler 2006, \nparagraph 18). As Chakrabarty (2002: 36) argues: \nThe Buddhist imagination once saw the possibility of the joyful, renunciate \nbhikshu (monk) in the miserable deprived image of the bhikshuk (beggar). We \nhave not yet learned to see the spectral doubles in our Marxism-inspired images \nof the subaltern. \nFor Chakrabarty (2000: 243), modernity is a \u201cproblem of entangled times\u201d where past, \npresent and future are drawn together in profoundly complex relations. The universal \ndistinctions at the heart of the modernity\/enchantment dichotomy (in particular, between \nmodernity and tradition, secularism and superstition) are based on linear notions of time \nand progress and, therefore, often have little relevance when viewed from outside \n 13 \nwestern cultures where processes of modernity are negotiated in complex ways.\n6\n It is in \nthe spaces of entangled times, of transformation and uncertainty, that ghosts and spectres \nappear, producing quite different but no less political enchantments to those envisaged \nby Bennett. Ghosts and hauntings are present in the interstices of social forces and lived \nexperience; ghost stories, both oral and written, proliferate at times of social upheaval, \nwhere ghosts symbolise the fracturing of time and a disquieting present.  \nIt is perhaps for these reasons that ghost stories and other unsettling enchantment \nnarratives are ubiquitous. From millennial anxieties and fascination with cyborgs, to \nfears of cloning, genetic mutation and invasion by aliens, the world is replete with stories \nof \u201cnot-quite-human transactions in the corporeal\u201d (Comaroff and Comaroff, 1998: 281). \nGhosts also flourish in rapidly modernising societies, in fiction and in popular \nimaginations, and often as critiques of modernity.\n7\n In such contexts, ghosts are not \nsimply relics of a past being rapidly eroded but are themselves products of modernity; \n                                                          \n6\n The literature in postcolonial studies on this topic is expansive but see, for example, \nChakrabarty, 2000, Comaroff and Comaroff, 1993, Coronil, 1997, Dube, 2002, \nFerguson, 1999, Geschiere, 1999, Joshi, 2001, Moore and Sanders, 2001, Ramaswamy, \n2004. \n7\n Juan Ruflo\u201fs (1994) Pedro P\u00e1ramo, for example, revealed the disquieting presence of a \ndying but not quite dead traditional Mexico in the 1950s, where ghosts symbolised a \nlingering reality no longer present but not yet past. Similarly, Marcus (1999) \ndemonstrates how ghost stories represented the ambivalence of middle-class Londoners \ntowards urbanisation in the 1850s, particularly fears concerning overcrowding. \n 14 \nthey are not simply symbolic of a haunting loss, but products of complex engagements \nwith rapidly changing circumstances. None of this is particularly novel, of course, but \nwhat is often missing from current debates is an understanding that the cultural politics \nof enchantment differ over time and space. On the one hand, postcolonialism has posed \nsignificant challenges to western-centric understandings of modernity, yet on the other \nhand, the fact that non-metropolitan modernities might be enchanted in quite different \nways is in danger of being overlooked, at least within some aspects of current \nmetropolitan theorising. The politics of enchantment as they are currently articulated do \nnot necessarily reflect the lived experiences of enchanted modernities in non-\nmetropolitan, postcolonial contexts. As the example recounted below illustrates, ghost \nstories articulate different kinds of enchantment, but ones that might make visible \neconomic and social injustices, reveal postcolonial power relations and have the \npotential to invert them. Their political possibilities may or may not be transformative \n(Pile, 2005) but they are revealing of the multiple ways in which modernities are \nenchanted and enchanting and might offer a different kind of ethical engagement with \nthe world.  \n \nThe haunting of Rashida:\n8\nghostly presences in apartment 603  \n                                                          \n8\n Pseudonyms are used to protect the identities of those involved. These events took \nplace between January and April 2001. The conversations were in English and were \nrecorded in writing immediately afterwards; extracts are reproduced from fieldnotes. \nWhen Rashida (and later Thuli) began to tell me these stories, I asked their permission to \n 15 \nI met Rashida while conducting research in Cape Town, South Africa. For six months in \n2001, I rented an apartment in a 6-storey hotel block in Sea Point, to the west of the city \ncentre. When I first lived there, the landlady employed a young woman in her early \nthirties to clean the apartment. Rashida travelled to work from the Mitchell\u201fs Plain area \nof the Cape Flats, a daily round journey of around forty miles, which involves \nnegotiating various forms of public transport including a bus-ride into Cape Town and a \nmini-bus taxi to Sea Point. On occasion I would be home when Rashida called and we \ndeveloped an amicable relationship. I helped with her various chores so that she could \nspare time for a drink, in which time we also exchanged stories about our respective \nlives or events in Cape Town.  \n18th January \nI ask Rashida if she enjoys her job. She says it is okay, but it does not make her \nhappy because she has to work long hours. Susan [the landlady] allegedly says \nthat she does not clean things properly, especially if Rashida finishes too early. \nRashida says she has too many apartments to clean. I ask her if she thinks Susan \nis unreasonable. Rashida says yes and \u201cshe is rude\u201d. Susan makes her clean other \napartments in Sea Point without prior notice; she does not receive additional \npayment for this. Rashida says she is always late getting home. I ask if she has a \nlong way to go. She says yes, to Mitchell\u201fs Plain. The buses are slow and the \n                                                                                                                                                                           \nmake notes about our conversations with the possibility that these might be reproduced \nin publications. Both women gave consent and were indifferent about anonymity, but \nthis is protected nonetheless. \n 16 \nmini-bus taxis are dangerous. Rashida says she has been robbed; the taxis are run \nby gangs. I ask her if there is any way she can work closer to home, but she \nanswers that there are no jobs. Work is hard to find. She cannot afford to leave \nthis job. Besides, she works such long hours and has to take care of her two \nchildren [she is a single mother], so she does not have any time to look. \n23\nrd\n February \nRashida asks me if I have heard about the white girl who was stabbed in the \nstreet outside. I tell her that I have; I heard it was drugs-related and he was after \nmoney, but it is not common round here from what I hear. Rashida pauses and \nthen says, \u201cThere is evil in this place.\u201d I say, \u201cWhat, in Sea Point?\u201d Rashida \nshakes her head, points at the floor and, reverting to Afrikaans, whispers \ninsistently, \u201cGees. Hier. [Ghost. Here.]\u201d I laugh: \u201cYeah, they keep me awake \nsome nights\u201d. Rashida does not respond and changes the subject. \n5\nth\n April \nI ask Rashida if she can stay for a cup of coffee. She says no, she should carry on \nnext door. Then she says, \u201cThings are getting bad.\u201d I ask her what she means: \n\u201cwith work?\u201d Rashida responds, \u201cDangerous\u201d. I ask in what way. She says, \u201cIf I \ntell you\u201d and pauses; \u201cit\u201fs a secret. But she has been bewitching me.\u201d I am \nconfused and ask \u201cWho?\u201d Rashida answers \u201cSusan. She doesn\u201ft like me. She is \nmaking ghosts follow me so that I will become sick if I don\u201ft work hard enough. \nThings happen; bad things.\u201d \nAt this point, I was unsure how to react. I had encountered spirit beliefs amongst \nXhosa-speaking peoples in the Western Cape, but had never heard such stories from \n 17 \npeople who self-identified as \u201eColoured\u201f, as Rashida did. I struggled to make sense of \nwhat Rashida was saying but she refused to elaborate, insisting again in whispers that her \nemployer had bewitched her and that there were ghosts in the apartments that spied on \nher.  \nTwo days later, I found an enormous cockroach \u2013 a common pest in the Cape \u2013\nperched on the bathroom wall. I was in rush to leave for work and left it, believing that \nRashida would deal with it. Rashida apparently did arrive as usual while I was out, but I \nnever saw her again. Susan told me that Rashida had seen the cockroach and claimed it \nas proof that she was bewitched and being \u201cspied on by ghosts\u201d. That the apartment \nblock was periodically infested mattered nothing. Rashida was adamant that she was \nbeing haunted, and left without finishing her shift. Susan dismissed this as \u201csilly, crazy, \nblack superstition\u201d and \u201cjust an excuse to leave without working notice\u201d. Rashida\u201fs \nreplacement was Thuli, who had worked for Susan for over two years.  \n11\nth\n April \nI ask Thuli if she knows why Rashida left. Thuli says no. I ask her if she knows \nthat Rashida said there were ghosts here and that she was haunted. Thuli answers \nmatter-of-factly, \u201cOh, there are ghosts. It\u201fs true. Some people are cruel.\u201d I ask \nwhat she means. Thuli shrugs and says, \u201cI heard that some people keep maids by \nmagic. It keeps us working. And it is dangerous to complain or leave then.\u201d I ask \nwho does this. Thuli says, \u201cRich people. They use muthi [medicine] too.\u201d \u201cAnd \nghosts?\u201d I ask. Thuli nods and says, \u201cAll bad things.\u201d I ask why Rashida was \nhaunted. Thuli says she does not know; \u201cThe ghosts are frightening to make \npeople stay and the muthi makes you sick. I shouldn\u201ft talk about this. It is a bad \n 18 \nthing.\u201d I ask if she knows where Rashida is now; she says she thinks she is in \nMuizenberg [much closer to Rashida\u201fs home in Mitchell\u201fs Plain]. I ask if she has \na new job. Thuli says she thinks so. I ask if Rashida is still haunted. Thuli smiles \nand says \u201cProbably not\u201d. \n \nPlacing Rashida\u2019s ghosts \nIn order to be fully appreciated, Rashida\u201fs ghosts need to be located in the wider \nexplanatory context of South African modernity and, in particular, the dramatic increase \nin similar occult phenomena from the 1990s that has coincided with enormous political \nand economic changes. Many postcolonial and post-liberation societies appear to have \nwitnessed a dramatic rise in occult economies and the deployment of magical means for \nmaterial ends (Comaroff and Comaroff, 1998). In South Africa, these include a wide \nrange of phenomena: a proliferation of ghosts, hauntings and spirit possession, \u201eritual \nmurder\u201f, the sale of body parts, the emergence of living ghosts or zombies, pyramid \nschemes and other financial scams. According to Comaroff and Comaroff, at the heart of \nthis is a narrative in which rich and powerful people use monstrous means to further \ntheir own interests by appropriating resources, labour or even the lives of less powerful \npeople (ibid.: 279).  \n South Africa is experiencing rapid social transformation; anthropologists and \nsocial historians have demonstrated that at such times people often seek recourse to the \noccult, both as a mode of explanation for their rapidly changing lives and sometimes as a \nmeans of resistance (cf. West, 2001). Thus, new forms of enchantment coincide with \nmodernity precisely because its conditions \u201cyield an ambiguous mix of possibility and \n 19 \npowerlessness, of desire and despair, of mass joblessness and hunger amidst the \naccumulation, by some, of great amounts of new wealth\u201d (Comaroff and Comaroff, \n1998: 283). This provides the context for a dramatic increase in occult-related violence, \nparticularly in relation to witchcraft and spirit possession in the period of post-apartheid \ntransition in the 1990s and, more recently, the alleged proliferation of zombies and \nghosts. Much of this violence was concentrated in the most impoverished provinces, \nLimpopo and Eastern Cape, where the death toll has been in the thousands (Kohnert, \n2003).\n9\n A variety of ghosts have emerged as a response to rapid, inequitable and \ndisturbing economic change particularly amongst those who feel increasingly powerless \nand whose autonomy and selfhood are increasingly being eroded. However, although the \noccult continues to wax behind the apparently civil surfaces of postcolonial South \nAfrican modernities, this is not the only context for the ghosts in apartment 603.  \nOne of the unanswered questions about Rashida\u201fs ghosts is their origin; while \nstories of ghosts and other occult phenomena have increased in recent years in South \nAfrica, they are more often associated with impoverished rural communities than with \nurban Afrikaans-speaking areas. One can only speculate on why Rashida told these \nstories and what significance particular events had, since I never met her again. \nHowever, it transpired in previous conversations that Rashida\u201fs origins are in the \u201eCape \n                                                          \n9\n The problem was so acute that in 1995 a commission of inquiry was established into \nwitchcraft violence and ritual murders and a national conference held to discuss the issue \n(Ralushai, 1996; CGE, 1999). \n 20 \nMalay\u201f community10 (first formed by the arrival of slaves brought by the Dutch East \nIndies Company from its territories in what is now Indonesia). Perhaps because of the \nfractures wrought by slavery, dislocation and colonialism, the Muslim religion is often \nmore salient today than a sense of \u201eMalay\u201f ancestry and many non-Muslims self-identify \nas \u201eColoured\u201f (using the old apartheid terminology) or as \u201eblack\u201f for political reasons. \nHowever, despite this fracturing, aspects of \u201eMalay\u201f culture have survived, particularly \nin Cape cuisine and the presence of Malay words in the Afrikaans language. Aspects of \n\u201eMalay\u201f spiritual beliefs also continue to resonate, with evidence of acceptance of \nvarious syncretic elements in daily Islamic belief systems and social and religious \ncustoms.\n11\n There are striking similarities between the nature of Rashida\u201fs ghosts and \nhow they haunted her and prevailing spirit beliefs in Malaysia and Indonesia. The \ncockroach, for example, resembles the pelesit, a vampiric Malaysian spirit that is \nbelieved to take on the form of a house cricket and is \u201esent\u201f by a malevolent to facilitate \n                                                          \n10\n Ethnicity is obviously politically loaded and deeply contentious in South Africa. The \n\u201eCape Malay\u201f identity is perhaps better thought of as the product of a set of histories and \ncommunities rather than an ethnic group per se (see Adhikari, 2005; Erasmus, 2003). \n11\n Paulsen (2005) suggests that birth, grave worshipping and other \u201eMalay\u201f ceremonies \nsyncretise pre-Islamic local tribal customs and aspects of Hinduism that have been \ndiffused since slavery; \u201eMalay\u201f South Africans visit dukums (spiritual doctors) and retain \nsuperstitions that Safar (the second Islamic month) is filled with fear, ill-fortune and bad \nluck. Some Cape Town residents I spoke to about this remember occasional incidences \nof witchcraft amongst Coloured neighbours (Shari Daya, pers.comm.). \n 21 \nattacks by another kind of spirit known as a polong (Skeat, 1902; Chen, 1970).\n12\n The \npelesit functions much like a \u201espy\u201f, echoing Rashida\u201fs claims about her ghosts, but it can \nalso cause harm (madness, illness, death) to the person it is intended for. Rashida \napparently claimed that the cockroach was evidence of Susan\u201fs malevolence; whether \nshe believed it to be a pelesit or not, the fact that she invoked this as a manifestation of \nghostly presences is itself of significance.  \nWhile Rashida\u201fs invocation of ghosts and hauntings might be considered \nunusual, when set against the broader context of contemporary South Africa and the \nspecific postcolonial cultural context of Cape Town it perhaps begins to make sense. As \nGelder and Jacobs (1998: 42) argue: \n Ghosts simply could not function in a climate of sameness, in a country which  \nfantasises about itself as \u201eone nation\u201f or which imagines a utopian future of \n\u201ereconciliation\u201f in which\u2026 all the ghosts have been laid to rest. But neither can \nthey function in a climate of nothing but difference, where the one can never \nresemble the other, as in a \u201edivided\u201f nation.  \nIn South Africa sameness and difference collide in complex ways, creating a structure in \nwhich \u201csameness and difference embrace and refuse each other simultaneously\u201d (ibid). \nGhosts continue to flourish in this structure and in the range of practices that intervene \nbetween imagination and politics: \n                                                          \n12\n This similarity transpired in conversation with my colleague Hamzah Muzaini, to \nwhom I am grateful for sharing insights into Malaysian spiritual beliefs. \n 22 \n[T]he spirits change to reflect the new situation rather than the precolonial spirit \nworld. They are as dynamic and as everchanging as the network of social \nrelations that encompasses the believers, and their meaning mediates those \nchanges\u2026. (Taussig, 1980: 230) \nThe ghosts that haunt Rashida are thus a product of the complexities of very specific \npostcolonial modernities.  \n \nGhosts, postcoloniality and work \nStories of ghosts in places of work are not uncommon, especially in the postcolonial \nworld.\n13\n The prevalence of the occult has been explained as a particular feature of \ncontemporary postcolonial economies: \nOn the one hand is a perception, authenticated by glimpses of the vast wealth that  \npasses through most postcolonial societies and into the hands of a few of their  \ncitizens: that the mysterious mechanisms of the market hold the key to hitherto  \nunimaginable riches; to capital amassed by the ever more rapid, often immaterial \nflow of value across time and space, and into the intersecting sites where the \n                                                          \n13\n Malaysia, in particular, is well documented in this regard, especially the ghosts \nassociated with components factories in the Free Trade Zone against the context of dire \nworking conditions and the intense social scrutiny placed on women workers in the \n1980s (Buang, 1993; Ong, 1987; Spivak, 1988; cf. Lim, 1997). The ambiguous and \nambivalent positions of women workers and the anxiety they both generated and felt \nemanated in hantu (spirits and ghosts) and associated outbreaks of mass hysteria. \n 23 \nlocal meets the global. On the other hand is the dawning sense of chill \ndesperation attendant on being left out of the promise of prosperity, of the telos \nof liberation (Comaroff and Comaroff, 1998: 284). \nThis argument echoes dialectical accounts of the enchantments of modernity found in \nother anthropological studies (see, for example, Coronil, 1997; Moore and Sanders, \n2001; Ong, 1987; Taussig, 1980). In South Africa, rapid political and social \ntransformation has not been matched by a transformation in economic circumstances for \nthe vast majority of people. This is an important context for Rashida\u201fs story. While she \nis not employed as a black servant in a white household (the notorious \u201emaid-madam\u201f \ndynamic of oppression under apartheid (Cock 1989) that persists in contemporary South \nAfrica\n14\n) she is employed by an individual to clean privately owned properties. She has \nno union protection and has little control over her conditions of work; she told me she \nearns R8 per hour (at the time little over 50 pence or $1). Her claims about her employer \nand the powers that she is able to wield thus allude to the dynamics outlined by \nComaroff and Comaroff, but I also want to suggest that there is something possibly more \nplayful and strategic about Rashida\u201fs ghosts. As White (1993, 28) argues, we \u201cmust \n                                                          \n14\n A Human Right Committee of South Africa report (HRC, 2000) outlines the state of \ndomestic workers, suggesting that the informal status of domestic work perpetuates \nextreme exploitation and allows non-implementation of rights-based legislation. South \nAfrica's Basic Conditions of Employment Act, Chapter Four: Particulars of Employment \nand Remuneration (1998) excluded domestic workers \n(http:\/\/www.workinfo.com\/free\/Sub_for_legres\/data\/bcea1998.htm#CHAPTER4). \n \n 24 \nask\u2026 what things that never happened meant to the people for whom they were real \u2013 \npeople who\u2026 claimed these things happened to them\u201d.  \nRashida\u201fs claims of haunting appropriate narratives of spirit-belief and \nwitchcraft, wherein the malevolent is a white woman and she is a disempowered worker \nwhose labour is controlled by someone else. This kind of story resonates in \ncontemporary South Africa. The apparent fear of ghosts and their interweavings with \nwhite economic power coincide with a broader discourse about local entrepreneurs \nturning their workers into zombies \u2013 living ghosts who are never seen but who \nperpetually haunt vulnerable workers who seem to have no choice but to sell their labour \ncheaply. Zombie workers are part of an increasingly popular discourse that represents the \ntoil of living ghosts as pure surplus value, \u201call the charms of something created out of \nnothing\u201d (Marx, 1976: 325). In both Rashida and Thuli\u201fs conversation, there are subtle \nreferences to not only ghosts but broader fears: \u201cThings happen; bad things;\u201d \u201csome \npeople keep maids by magic. It keeps us working.\u201d  The precise nature of these fears is \nnot fully articulated but they seem to reflect their anxieties of being disempowered, \nrelatively vulnerable workers, which are also central to zombie discourses.  \nThe fear of ghost workers in South Africa exists alongside another spectre: \u201ca \ngrowing mass, a shadowy alien-nation, of immigrant black workers from elsewhere on \nthe continent\u201d (Comaroff and Comaroff, 1999: 21). It is perhaps unsurprising that older \npeople of apparent affluence are seen as malevolents and ghosts and zombies are thought \nto multiply as waged work becomes scarce among the young and the unskilled and \nimmigrant labour has significantly increased: \n 25 \nNot only does the rise of a phantom proletariat consume the life force of others, it \nalso destroys the labour market, conventional patterns of social reproduction, and \nthe legitimate prospects of \u201ethe community\u201f at large (Comaroff and Comaroff, \n1998: 294). \nZombies and ghosts capture a postcolonial moment creating \u201ca seismic mutation in the \nontological experience of work, self-hood, gender, community and place\u201d (Comaroff and \nComaroff, 2002: 798). While not discourses about modernity, Rashida\u201fs (and Thuli\u201fs) \nallusions to ghosts and hauntings can be understood within the frame of contemporary \nsocio-economic and political concerns; like broader popular discourses of other occult-\nrelated phenomena such as witchcraft, they also contain elements of a critique of white \ndomination.\n15\n In addition, it is perhaps not coincidental that a great deal of female in-\nmigration is absorbed into domestic service (Schultz and Mwabu, 1998); Rashida\u201fs \nexpressed fear of ghosts could be thought of as an articulation of a collective dread that \nrelates specifically to her vulnerable position as a cleaner. However, the fact that I was \nRashida\u201fs primary audience also needs to be considered when trying to decipher this \nstory and what it might mean.  \n                                                          \n15\n Niehaus (2001: 184-5), for example, demonstrates how the symbolic meanings of \ntokolot\u0161i (ape-like witch-familiars), mamlambo (snake-like witch-familiars) and zombies \nare intimately related to people\u201fs dependence on money, migration and wage-labour and \nare interwoven with stories of white witches, the dangerous technologies of makgoweng \n(places of the whites) and of witches with the attributes of whites. \n 26 \nTo interpret Rashida\u201fs story as only a metaphor of perceived oppression and \nexploitation would be to oversimplify since, like other orally transmitted information, it \nwas told at a specific time to a specific person for specific reasons (White 1993, 29). \nRashida and I were almost strangers and had not had a long period of time in which to \ndevelop cordiality into friendship. The terms of our relationship were profoundly \nunequal: I was a resident and she was responsible for cleaning the apartment I was \nrenting. However, the terms of disclosure were determined by Rashida. The ghosts in \napartment 603 are \u201ca secret\u201d according to her; similarly, Thuli felt unable to discuss \nthem and abruptly ended our discussion. Again, one can only speculate on the nature of \nand the reasons for this partial disclosure, and on why Rashida chose to tell me these \n\u201esecret\u201f stories. However, Rashida was obviously keen to impress upon me her account \nof conditions of work, perhaps to play on the rather obvious discomfiture I felt at the fact \nthat she was employed to clean my apartment.  \nThere may have been a material motive in this, since part of my dealing with this \ndiscomfiture was to give Rashida a generous tip. Of course, Rashida may have been \nhaving fun at my expense, perhaps in collusion with co-workers like Thuli, playing on \nthe fact that there are experiences and stories of experiences in South Africa that I can \nneither know nor understand \u2013 those aspects of life there to which access, as Spivak \nargues, is denied me by my relative privilege (see Landry and MacLean 1996, 4-5). \nHowever, it was clear from my conversations with both Thuli and Susan that Rashida \nhad also shared this story with them and Susan had certainly heard it on more than one \noccasion. Whether or not she believed in them, it seems that the ghosts that haunted \nRashida provided a tactic for articulating her feelings about her conditions of work. Her \n 27 \nstory enchants and disenchants simultaneously, delighting through its potential mischief \nbut not deluding, and revealing much about Rashida\u201fs experiences of working in Cape \nTown. Moreover, one might read such ghost stories as symbolic reworking of resistance \nor as a tactic of trangression.  \n \nEnchantment tales as tacit resistance or tactics of transgression \nSouth African domestic workers like Rashida appear to have little choice but to sell their \nlabour cheaply,\n16\n but they still have some agency that also carries political potency. For \nRashida, the lack of availability of conventional means of resisting poor working \nconditions is countered by representing her working life in language and imagery that \nexplains what she perceives to be unjust and iniquitous. Rashida\u201fs ghosts symbolize her \nrelative lack of power and control over her working conditions but she invokes them as a \nmeans to leave her job and find employment that better suits her daily life. She is able to \nquit without giving notice for work much closer to home, negating the need to commute \nand ensuring more time with her children. Thuli\u201fs knowing smile at the end of our \nconversation suggests that she too may have interpreted Rashida\u201fs action as a form of \n\u201cquiet cultural subversion\u201d (Weller, 1994: 3). As Spivak (2000: 42) argues: \n(Women\u201fs) resistance of this sort is \u2026 the name of the move by which the \ncollectivity of the chorus in Attic comedy moves up, again and again, to interrupt \n                                                          \n16\n Post-apartheid South African labour legislation is extremely progressive, but domestic \nservice is often less formalised and not covered (Schultz and Mwabu, 1998), \ncharacterised by low returns and little security (Casale and Posel, 2002). \n 28 \nthe seemingly coherent dramatic praxis\u2026 to inform the public of a structurally \ndifferent interpretation of the \u201esame\u201f action. \nThe question remains, however, as to how effective this resistance might be. Rashida\u201fs \nactions are a form of tacit rather than explicit resistance, \u201cembedded in everyday life \ninstead of strongly institutionalized as a new state\u201d (Weller, 1994: 4). Indeed, one could \nargue that it is a \u201ckind of play with the system\u201d (ibid.) rather than resistance. While \nsome, such as Taussig (1980), have proclaimed the significance of such tacit resistance, \nothers claim just as strongly that powerful hegemonic structures undercut it, rendering it \nsuperficial or illusory. \n Rashida\u201fs ghost story belongs to the kinds of resistance that Scott (1985, 29; see \nalso Alinksy, 1971; Scott, 1990) refers to as \u201cordinary weapons of relatively powerless \ngroups\u201d, performing similar functions to \u201cfoot dragging, dissimulation, false compliance, \npilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson, sabotage\u2026\u201d This is implicit resistance \nwhere active class struggle is largely absent. Rashida\u201fs subversions are, perhaps, safe \nresistances because they are partly unspoken, relying on the unknowable and working \nthrough metaphor and irony rather than resisting directly. Some would argue that this \nkind of counter-hegemony and subversion is futile, changing nothing and leaving social \nhierarchies and economic conditions unchanged.\n17\n However, despite wariness towards \n                                                          \n17\n See the debate between Bakhtin (1984) and Eco (1984), for example. In a business \ncontext, Hirschman (1970) argues that \u201eexit\u201f (like Rashida\u201fs decision to leave her job) \noften undercuts voice while being unable to resist, while loyalty is seen as retarding exit \nand permitting voice to play its proper role in generating change from within.  \n 29 \nwhat Abu-Lughod (1990) terms the \u201cromance of resistance\u201d, it is important to analyse \nacts of resistance in their own terms, rather than trying to identify singular meaning. This \nenables the replacement of abstract theories of power and hegemony with subjectivities \nthat are capable of contingent and flexible modes of resistance (Pile and Keith, 1997), \nallowing questioning about the relations of power at play in different contexts. As Pile \n(1997: 2) argues, \u201cgeographies of resistance do not necessarily (or even ever) mirror \ngeographies of domination\u201d. Rashida\u201fs story illustrates that resistance is a means through \nwhich the effects of different power relations are revealed and then countered, lived \nthrough or changed. Resistant political subjectivities are constituted through positions \ntaken up not only in relation to authority but also through experiences not easily labelled \n\u201epower\u201f, \u201csuch as desire and anger, capacity and ability, happiness and fear, dreaming \nand forgetting\u201d (ibid., 3).  \nIt may be that Rashida\u201fs ghost story and her subsequent actions have more \nmeaning than they know or intend (Bourdieu, 1977: 79). However, in the contexts in \nwhich they are invoked, her ghosts clearly have some political effect in that they are \ntransgressive, if only at an individual level. Moreover, they constitute what Scott (1990: \n19) refers to as \u201cinfrapolitics\u201d, which are low-profile forms of resistance by subordinate \ngroups, including rumour, gossip, and folk-tales. Infrapolitics is a form of political \nexpression and cultural struggle adopted by those who have reason to fear expressing \ntheir unguarded opinion. The meaning of Rashida\u201fs story is not straightforward and, like \nother \u201einfrapolitical\u201f texts may well be meant to communicate one thing to those in the \nknow and another to outsiders and authorities (ibid.: 184). It is a strategic form of \nresistance that makes no public claims and is designed to obscure Rashida\u201fs intentions. It \n 30 \nthus differs from open political action but is still \u201creal politics\u201d (ibid.: 200); Rashida\u201fs \nghostly tales of oblique aggression eventually led to a more direct form of action and is \nthus an example of how infrapolitics presses and probes the boundaries of the \npermissible to bring about resistance and minor change. \n Rashida\u201fs story is not a straightforward disenchanting story of exploitation, in \nwhich the symbolic systems that secure the conditions of domestic service in South \nAfrica \u2013 the language of capital \u2013 are represented by the ferocious imagery of ghosts, \n\u201cthe imagistic field on which the worker\u201fs physical and psychological conflicts play out\u201d \n(Medley and Carroll, 2004: 161). Rashida may well be haunted by the ghost of \nexploitation that feeds off her labour. She may see and believe in this exploitation. \nHowever, by telling ghost stories she is also struggling to assert her presence as a \nsubject, as other than an object of capital labouring under conditions over which she has \nlittle control and for profits to which she has no access. There is both mischief and \nassertion of agency in her story and its effects and, ultimately, an outcome that her early \nconversations with me reveal to be favourable in terms of improving her conditions of \nwork. Her tale represents a symbolic reworking of the space of apartment 603 (Bunnell \net al., 2006). The means to interpret Rashida\u201fs ghosts are thus available not only in \nfamiliar western language and disenchanting stories of exploitation but also in the \nsymbolic systems of cultures that have emerged from colonial into postcolonial and post-\napartheid organization (Medley and Carroll 2004). Rashida instigates exorcism by \nstruggling to assert her subjectship as a means of resisting and even transgressing \nrelationships of power that might work to transform it into subjection. The symbolism of \nspirits and ghosts speaks not of an ideology of class struggle in the classic sense of \n 31 \nresistance but of a demand to be treated as a human being (Ong 1987: 220). Rashida\u201fs \nghosts, then, have some modest, but for her no doubt significant, transformative effects. \n \nSocial and economic inequalities borne out of colonialism and apartheid continue to \nhaunt South African modernities and to some extent are manifested in the ghosts that \nRashida invokes. These ghosts are social figures that speak of the inequities that Rashida \nexperiences but is perhaps unable to articulate (Gordon, 1997). Her story thus performs \ndouble work: it is \u201csimultaneously [a] personal and social drama\u201d (Pile, 2005: 163). It is \nperhaps ironic that the liberties of post-independence have allowed ghost stories and \nother popular preoccupations with the occult to proliferate. One reading of this is a \nstraightforward dialectical account of the enchantments of modernity and their \nmanifestations in South Africa - as the desire to access the secret of invisible means of \naccumulating wealth and a concern to stem the spread of a \u201cmacabre, visceral economy \nfounded on the violence of extraction and abstraction\u201d (Comaroff and Comaroff, 1998: \n293). That the majority of people are poor is not new, but in post-apartheid and \npostcolonial contexts they are kept poor by what might appear to be the mystical \nmachinations of the few. As in the past when workers have been exploited, ghosts and \nspirits continue to symbolize exploitation. In South Africa, exploitation is blamed on the \nmacabre powers of white people and, while employment has dwindled before, it is now \nblamed on the creation of a virtual (migrant) labour force from ghosts and zombies. \nHowever, Rashida\u201fs story can also be read as not only revealing lived experiences of \npostcoloniality, but as a counterstory offering up forms of resistance to inequitable \neconomic and social relations. It might well be a form of tacit resistance, a means of \n 32 \narticulating disquiet about poor working conditions, or as a means to an end in terms of \nbeing part of Rashida\u201fs exit strategy from her current job. However we read it, it \nprovides valuable insights into the relationship between modernity and enchantment in \nthe South African context. \n  \nConclusions \nGhost stories raise questions about the broader politics of enchantment, specifically \nabout what appear to be missing elements from recent, optimistic cultural politics in \nwhich enchantment delights but does not delude. First, if we accept fear and dread, as \nwell as pleasure and wonderment, as fundamental aspects of enchanted modernities, we \nmight also consider how enchantment is often articulated around fear and born of \nunfulfilled wishes and unresolved anxieties. This is a less optimistic view than \nBennett\u201fs, for example, but no less politically charged. It relates to attempts to \u201cmake \nwishes come true (or anxieties go away) by using its understanding of the occult world to \nintervene in the world\u201d (Pile, 2005: 168). Rashida\u201fs ghost story is more about anxiety \nand fear than charm and joy and represents a quite different counterstory of enchantment. \nSecond, (re-)enchantment as a political and ethical project perhaps has a different \npurchase in advanced economic contexts than in postcolonial contexts where modernity \nand enchantment are interwoven in profoundly different ways. It would be difficult to \ntranslate Bennett\u201fs notion of enchantment as joyful attachment into a context where \nghosts, zombies and other manifestations of the occult are more prevalent articulations \nof enchantment. However, Bennett\u201fs concern that critical politics should not be \ndisenchanting is also of significance in South Africa, where abandonment of hope and \n 33 \noptimism would pose serious threats to post-apartheid transformation. There are clear \npolitical reasons for more optimistic notions of enchantment in a world where, as \nDevetak (2005) argues, current leaders evoke gothic scenes of ghosts and monsters in \ntenebrous atmospheres designed to generate fear and anxiety, where terrorists and rogue \nstates are dark, perverse, ineffable and potently violent and cruel forces that haunt and \nterrorise the civilised world. However, as Rashida\u201fs ghost story illustrates, the darker \nmarvels of enchanted modernities cannot be discounted, not least because they are of \nsignificance to people\u201fs daily lives and offer opportunities for agency and transgression.  \nThis paper is an account of a single ghost story encountered in the course of \nfieldwork, readings of which are always partial and contingent. However, it \ndemonstrates that ghost stories as counterstories also play a role in one of the key \nprojects of postcolonialism, that of \u201erecovery\u201f. As Gandhi (1998: 8) notes: \nIf [postcolonial theory\u201fs] scholarly task inheres in the carefully researched \nretrieval of historical detail, it has an equally compelling political obligation to \nassist the subjects of postcoloniality to live with the gaps and fissures of their \ncondition, and thereby to learn to proceed with self-understanding. \nNot only does the symbolism of ghosts have the potential to reveal the inhumanity of \nworking conditions but it is also a means for those who tell ghost stories to (re)assert \ntheir subjectship. In Rashida\u201fs case, this forms the basis for (albeit tacit) forms of \n 34 \nresistance and allows her to take action to improve her daily life.\n18\n Ghost stories can be \nthus inherently political and potentially transformative.  \nFinally, the paper illustrates ways in which enchantment returns continuously to \nunsettle the secular, skeptical, modern world (Gelder, 2000) and is suggestive of how an \nalternative perspective might be to be traced between an overly cynical politics that \nworks to disenchant the world and more optimistic accounts of the ethical possibilities of \nenchantment. It suggests that the critical and politicised tales we tell need not be \ndisenchanted; it is possible to reveal injustices in the world while simultaneously \nrevealing that world as thoroughly enchanted and enchanting, haunted and haunting. \nGhost stories thrive, in particular, in times of upheaval and transformation, reflecting \nboth the profound anxieties that accompany socio-economic, cultural and\/or political \nchange and ways of coping or resisting some of the effects of these changes. They are \nproducts of very specific conditions and experiences, of individual and collective \nimaginations that are framed within and constituted by broader socio-cultural and \neconomic contexts. They interject the missing, the spectres that are otherwise obscured \nin dominant discourses of modernity (Medley and Carroll, 2004). In encompassing \nemotional, psychological and cultural aspect of people\u201fs lives, they open up the \npossibility of more ambivalent yet critical readings of modernity.  \n \n                                                          \n18\n See also, for example, Ong\u201fs (1987) discussion of Malaysian women workers\u201f strategy \nin the 1980s of claiming their factories were haunted in order to take otherwise \nprohibited industrial action. \n 35 \nAcknowledgements \nMy encounters with Rashida occurred during the course of research funded by ESRC \n(R000223286).
