It looks as if it is impossible \u2013 just \nwhen they think they\u2019ve got it, there\u2019s a loud splash and a muffled curse or two as the sailor falls \ninto the water, closely followed by the mast and sail. After remounting the board, the sailor \nstands hesitantly and laboriously, dragging the sail into an upright position before again trying to \nmake progress forwards. They often topple over several times before anything like \u2018sailing\u2019 \nhappens. There is of course the opposite experience of seeing a sailboard - or windsurfer as it is \nmore usually termed - hurtling along, bouncing over waves like a powerboat, turning with what \nseems to be an effortless swoop completed with a neat flip of the sail. And then off again, \ntearing along, the wind and water completely harnessed by the small figure hanging off at one \nside.  \nBut is any of this extreme? Windsurfing is not an extreme sport in terms of danger; very few \npeople die windsurfing and even serious injuries are infrequent. It is true that in wave sailing, \nwhere jumping or somersaulting above the water can result in the board and rig falling on top of \nthe sailor, there are injuries and some sailors wear helmets. But whether sailing for fun or in \ncompetition, there is little risk of serious injury, even through falling off at high speed. \nSailboarders have been killed in collisions but compared to any sort of aerial or motor sport it is \nrelatively safe. The things that make windsurfing extreme are the same things that make it \nfascinating to watch and participate in, that is, the complexity of the dynamic relationship \nbetween the sailor\u2019s body, the kit of sail and board, the water and the wind. In this paper we \nexplore two dimensions of the extreme distinctiveness of windsurfing. In the first section we \nexplore some of the phenomenological characteristics of its extremeness and in the second we \nconsider how the embodied nature of the sport contributes to the sub-cultural capital that makes \nit a distinctive sporting practice in late modern societies. \n \nPhysical Capital \nBourdieu suggests that sailing is one of those sports in which \u2018gains in distinction\u2019 can be \nachieved (1978: 828) and in which all the features that appeal to the dominant classes are \ninvolved (exclusive setting, available at any time, alone or with chosen partners, ritualised \ncompetitions, relatively low physical exertion, relatively high investment of learning, but low \ndemands on physical capital so little affected by the life-course, etc. 1994: 215-7). Perhaps \nappropriate to yacht racing, this approach does not work for windsurfing \u2013 and indeed it would \nnot work for most types of dinghy sailing either.1  \nThe physical capital required for windsurfing falls into two separable forms; the material \ncapital of the kit or equipment and the embodied capital of the sailor. The material capital of the \nkit is available in exchange for economic capital \u2013 money. This is still significant enough to \nexclude those without a reasonable wage but is small enough not to mark out class fractions; the \ncost of adequate equipment would be less than a small ten-year-old car. But the material capital \nis of little use without the embodied capital of the sailor that must be accumulated within their \nbody. In contrast to yachting, where an owner could hire crewmembers for strength and skill (this \nstill happens in offshore racing), the sailboarder does it all her or himself. While changes in \ntechnology have reduced the economic capital required for boardsailing compared to sailing \nyachts, the physical capital required has increased. Sailing racing dinghies, a sort of \nintermediate stage between sailing as yachting and sailing as board-sailing, required \u2018sitting-out\u2019 \nby the crew to balance the wind on the rig and aids such as the sliding seat and trapeze were \ndeveloped to take the best advantage of their weight. The increase in agility and skill required \nwas rewarded by increased speed as the lightweight dinghies could, in the right conditions, \nplane over the water like a speedboat. Windsurfing ratcheted up this shift in the physical capital \nrequired to participate in sailing as the boards were designed to be usually sailed on the plane \nand to always integrate the crew\u2019s body as part of the rig. It also increased the vertiginous \npleasure and excitement to be had from the sailing (Dant 1998).  \n \nMaterial Capital \nDinghy sailing can be seen as a democratisation of yachting during the middle of the 20th \ncentury. The technology of modern materials (plywood, fibreglass, aluminium, terylene) enabled \nsmall sailing craft to be built, sailed, maintained and raced competitively for much less cost than \nyachts. If sailing dinghies democratised sailing during the first two thirds of the 20th century \u2013 the \nboom period would be after the second world war \u2013 windsurfing utilised a further shift in \ntechnology to further disconnect sailing as a sport from institutions (clubs, organisations) and \nfurther reduce the economic capital required. The technology of new artificial materials \nincreased the strength and weight of the boards, sails, mast and booms so that the production \n                                                \n1 Bourdieu was of course writing at a time when windsurfing was a new and marginal sport. \ntechniques could be ever more precise in making the components responsive and adaptable. \nModern sailboards are light but inflexible whereas modern rigs hold a foil shape that is \naerodynamically efficient while able to flex in response to increases in wind pressure. The \nsailboard and its rig can easily be put on top of a small car and launched from a beach rather \nthan in the exclusive surroundings of a private club (windsurfers often change in the back of a \ncar and rig up in the car park). The further development of kite boarding, which uses a kite rather \nthan sail for propulsion, means that everything can be put in boot of the car, or even trailed \nbehind a bicycle (Fig. 1).  \nWhat we see in windsurfing is a hybrid activity in which actions and equipment from other \nsports (particularly dinghy sailing and wave surfing) are modified and brought together. \nSkateboarding, snowboarding and kite-surfing are other sports that have appropriated the \nboard-skimming-over-a-surface mode originating in surfing, where the board is steered by the \nrider leaning their body into the turn. Windsurfing itself encompasses a range of forms of the \nactivity based on different craft and ways of sailing them. Inland lake sailors, use longboards \ndesigned to be sailed in all wind strengths, whereas coastal sailors use smaller \u2018sinkers\u2019 \nintended for use in open seas and high winds. The material capital of the individual windsurfer is \noften accumulated in a collection of kit that includes at least one board \u2013 often two or more \u2013 \nand two or three sails and masts that can be rigged up to suit the particular conditions. The \nwindsurfer\u2019s kit also includes different fins, mast bases and extensions, wetsuits, harnesses and \nso on. Equipment that is used often wears out. But new \u2018better\u2019 versions of all bits of kit come on \nto the market continually and are visible in the material capital of other sailors.   \nMaterial capital is not only appropriated through the acquisition of kit. Like the yacht and \ndinghy sailor, the windsurfer dominates a certain space through their activity; as they sail over \nthe water they are claiming it as theirs. Windsurfing usually happens on the open sea or on lakes \nand reservoirs where their rights to sail have to be managed with those of other users. Some \nbeaches will demarcate areas for windsurfing and mark channels for launching to keep the \nsailors separate from swimmers. In general though, these divisions of publicly available space \nbetween different activities are far less fractious and contentious than have been documented in \nother lifestyle sports, such as that between skateboarders and pedestrians in the city or surfers \naggressive exclusion of other water users. There are, however, contests for space on the water \nbetween sailors. In formal competitions these are managed by rules that assign rights of way \nthat can be contested through institutional structures. Nonetheless competition for free wind and \nwater can be quite aggressive. In freeriding or leisure sailing, popular stretches of water can \nbecome quite crowded and if there are no designated areas then jet skis, sailboards, kite-\nsurfers, yachts, speedboats and water-skiers may all compete for space with little general \nagreement of rights of way and no authorities to appeal to. Furthermore, particular beaches or \nwave breaks have meanings as sub-cultural spaces and can be guarded by their users. In \nHawaii the epi-centre of wave windsurfing, popular wave breaks are claimed and policed by \ngroups of surfers, windsurfers and kite-surfers, sometimes overtly as in cases of surfers \nterritorialism or \u2018localism,\u2019 and sometimes more subtlety in the exclusion of female and less \nphysically able participants via a culture of meritocracy (Wheaton, 2002). The micro-politics of \nsub-cultural space with its competing statuses (gender \u2013 both between and within each gender, \nethnicity, national identity and other insider\/outsider categories) overlays and modifies the \nmateriality of space.  \n \nEmbodied Capital \nWithin Bourdieu\u2019s analysis of class distinction, it is through the habitus that classes reproduce \ntheir taste dispositions. Practices such as yachting and other sports or hobbies are passed on \nthrough participating with family and peer group members of the same class. But windsurfing \nrequires an intensive approach to learning which is more likely to involve formal teaching in the \nearly stages. Because there is only one person on the board, the novice has to learn solo; there \nis no opportunity to start off as crew or just going for a sail with someone else. The sport \nrequires a degree of strength and agility that does mean that age and gender affects those who \ncan or might wish to sail a board. Hence, the physical capital required is high and is affected by \nchanges over the life-course. But more important than strength is the acquisition of an embodied \nsense of how to respond to minute changes in the conditions created by wind and water. There \nis no substitute for a fairly flat learning curve in which practice trains the body to respond in ways \nthat are not directly connected with other prior experiences. Suggestions and hints from other \nsailors, including advice in books and magazines, watching other sailors, including on video \nrecordings, can assist in the bodily acquisition of the sensory-motor skills that are distinctive to \nwindsurfing. Acquiring the bodily skill is also an induction into a community or sub-culture of \nthose who share the skill; the sub-culture, which may have other features, will take the \nembodied ability as a key feature common to its members. \nThere are formalised competitions in windsurfing \u2013 it is an Olympic sport. There are clubs \nthat race, a professional \u2018circuit\u2019 and even \u2018indoor\u2019 windsurfing competitions, a made-for-TV \nmedia spectacle. But most windsurfers sail without ever engaging in them, preferring to \n\u2018freeride\u2019, that is to take pleasure in \u2018intrinsic\u2019 factors such as challenging the self or the \nenvironment. Even among elite participants, attitudes to formal \u2018man-on-man\u2019 [sic] competitions \nremain ambivalent. This does not mean that the sport is solitary or uncompetitive; sailors gather \non suitable beaches and will compete informally amongst themselves and make judgements \nabout each others\u2019 competence and skill that are central forms of sub-cultural capital and status. \nBecause windsurfers need sufficient wind, and in most settings the direction of the wind is \nimportant too, it is not a sport available \u2018at any time\u2019 but one in which those keen to participate \nwill sacrifice other activities \u2013 including paid work \u2013 to participate in. Attitudes to comparison \nbetween sailors, to the place of the sport in one\u2019s life and to the acquisition of skill are all part of \nthe embodied capital that makes windsurfing extreme.  \n \nMaterial Interaction \nGetting the sailboard to move requires a fine interaction between the sailor\u2019s body and the kit; \nthere is a complex \u2018material interaction\u2019 between the material capital that is in the objects of the \nkit and the embodied capital that is in the body of the sailor. The two hands, the two feet, and \nthe hips or torso all need to make fine adjustments that alter the relationship between the rig and \nthe board that are the principle components of the sailboard. Many interactions between humans \nand complex objects demand a range of simultaneous adjustments. Driving a car, for example, \nrequires that the two feet work independently and although while on the steering wheel, the \nhands work together, with a gearshift, the hands need to work independently (Dant 2004). Of \ncourse the car driver\u2019s torso is supported by their seat whereas the sailboarder\u2019s torso is very \nmuch part of the balancing of the rig against the force of the wind; a harness around hips or \nchest is hooked onto loops on the boom. The windsurfer, unlike the cyclist or even the \nyachtsman, has no handlebars, tiller or rudder with which to steer. Steering is achieved, more \nlike a downhill skier, by leaning the board in relation to the surface it is travelling over, a type of \nmotion developed from the wave surfer whose board skimming down the face surface of the \nwave provides the model (and sometimes the motive force) for the windsurfer. Even so, \nalthough the windsurfer will make some turning movements, particularly the \u2018carve\u2019 into a gybe, \nby leaning the body with the board into the turn, much of the steering of the board is done by \nmore finely adjusting the angle of the board, including its tiny fin or \u2018skeg\u2019, to the water. This is \ndone through the feet \u2013 even just the toes \u2013 that push, pull and tip the board while the sailor \nhangs to windward from the rig. Balancing the pressure of the wind on the sailboard\u2019s rig is \nsimilar to dinghy sailing but steering by leaning the craft is alien to other types of sailing.2  \nWhat is common to all of these sports that involve a body interacting with an object to \nachieve movement in space, is the sensation of speed and control. But unlike, say, formula one \nracing where there are mechanical controls, the control of the sailboard is wholly achieved by \nfine-tuning the orientation of the body to the object. At speed, this ability to achieve control must \nbecome as if it was intuitive; it must happen without conscious thought so that the equipment \nbecomes like a prosthetic extension of the sailor\u2019s body. The sailor must perceive and respond \nto the environment of wind and water through the equipment of board and sail. Touch and \nproprioception must work through the various bits of equipment rather than on them to achieve \nwhat Merleau-Ponty calls \u2018intentional threads\u2019 linking them the sailor (he refers to the tailor, his \nscissors, needle and thread to make the point \u2013 1962: 106). This mode of haptic perception is \ntied in with what he calls an \u2018intentional arc\u2019 that links the objects through the motor capacity of \nthe body to express her or his intentions.  \nWhat is extreme in windsurfing is the extent to which this intentional arc is complete and \ncannot be separated out into component parts or even component actions that might be \nunderstood and learnt separately. Whereas the driver of the car can see \u2018steering\u2019 as an action \nof the hands and \u2018braking\u2019 as an action of the feet that are oriented to distinct and specific \ncontrols, the windsurfer is engaged in balance, steering, accelerating\/braking, through their \nwhole body, all the time that sailing is taking place. Now, this is true of running; the whole body \nis continually involved in balance, steering, breaking\/accelerating even if there is most emphasis \non the legs as the motive force. But in windsurfing the motor force is external to the body, as are \nthe forces through which balance and steering are to be achieved (the sail and the board). What \nis more, the acquisition of the motor and sensory skills necessary to achieve sailing on a board, \nare neither straightforwardly intuitive nor part of the normal upbringing of children. Running or \nball-throwing is learnt as part of growing up - albeit it often in specifically gendered ways (Young \n                                                \n2 Below planning speeds, steering of a sailboard is achieved by leaning the rig back or forwards \nand in a similar way a dinghy or yacht can just about be steered using the balance between the \ntwo sails if the rudder is broken. \n2005). But sports that involve manoeuvring a piece of equipment like a sailboard have to be \nconsciously and intentionally learnt.  \nWhat we wish to argue is that some forms of sport \u2013 and windsurfing is an extreme example \u2013 \nrequire an embodied learning that is not simply dependent on the habitus through which it might \nbe picked up. Instead it requires a desire to join the sub-cultural group by acquiring complex \nsensory and motor skills not shared by those outside this group. It is possible to distinguish \ndifferent capitals that have to be brought together to bring about windsurfing but material and \nembodied capital can only be realised through the material interaction between them. More than \nthis though, the physical capital of windsurfing, while it may give the sport its distinctive and \nextreme character, only makes sense, only becomes meaningful to participants, through the \nsocial process of a sub-culture. Rather than thinking of windsurfing in terms of its orientation to \nclass as Bourdieu does, we feel it is more interesting to understand it as a sport that is extreme \nin the commitment to the distinctive sub-culture of embodiment that it involves.  \n \nSub-cultural Capital and Embodiment  \nThe term sub-cultural capital was coined by Thornton (1995) in her appropriation of Bourdieu\u2019s \nwork on \u2018distinction\u2019 to understand the cultural distinctions, or authenticity claims that mark \ncontemporary youth dance cultures. Sub-cultural capital, involves distinctions between insider \nand outsider \u2013 \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 \u2013 but also helps make sense of the status hierarchies within the \nculture, recognising the ways in which the social determinants of  class, age, gender, sexuality \nand race are all employed in these hierarchies (1995: 105).    \nEthnographic research on windsurfing (and other similar \u2018lifestyle sport\u2019 cultures such as \nsurfing, skateboarding and snowboarding) has shown that participants seek out a lifestyle that is \ndistinctive, sometimes alternative, and that this gives them a particular and exclusive social \nidentity. Moreover that membership, identity and status is influenced by factors including class, \ngender and race.3 However, the meaning of participation is articulated as the embodied \nperformance of the activity, around the felt experience of doing it. The sport has a participatory \nideology that promotes fun, involvement, \u2018living for the moment\u2019 and other intrinsic rewards. \nParticipants talk about \u2018the adrenaline rush\u2019 and the thrill (Wheaton & Beal 2003).  \n                                                \n3 See for example chapters in Rinehart & Sydnor 2003; also Wheaton (2002); Wheaton & Beal \n(2003).  \nWindsurfers are not a homogeneous group. Those who do the sport range from novices  \nthrough the \u2018weekend warriors,\u2019 to the \u2018hard core\u2019 committed practitioners who are fully \nfamiliarised in the lifestyle, argot, fashion and, centrally, the technical skill of their activity. Yet \nthey share an understanding of the specific embodiment it entails as well as how the physical \nprowess translates into forms of sub-cultural capital or status. Despite the visibility of symbolic \nmarkers of the windsurfing participant\u2019s identity, such as surf clothing, it is the less visible \nembodied aspects of identity such as skill, commitment and attitude that are often more \nsignificant to the participant\u2019s notions of \u2018authenticity\u2019. For example, although clothing and style \nis an integral part of the windsurf culture, windsurfers did not want to be seen to be buying into \nan image and have coined terms such as \u2018fashion surfers\u2019 to describe those individuals who try \nto display their sub-cultural identification solely via surf style (or by conspicuously displaying \u2013 \nrather than using \u2013 their equipment).    \n  \nIt\u2019s almost a spiritual thing [..] the feel good factor is so high - even if you've had a bad spell \nit's better than not sailing at all - you know, like the buzz I get, the endorphin sort of buzz. \nThe simple physical feeling it gives you is great I think, and the mental spin-off [..] I don't \nknow a single other sport that's been able to give me those sorts of things.  [..] So, I think it's \njust, it's terribly life enhancing.  \n \nwhen I discovered windsurfing it was so far from everything I was used to, the other sports, \nbecause it is natural,  you have freedom and big space, and crazy sensations.  \n \nThe meaning of windsurfing for the participants is found in the body, in their creative and self \nactualization potential. Although participants invest heavily in their lifestyles and identities, this \ncommitment is a commitment to pleasure, what they call  the buzz, the ecstasy of speed, being \nat one with the environment, the standing still of time, experiencing what Csikszentmihalyi \n(1975) describes as flow. \nThe motivation to engage in the action and the pleasure derived from engagement are \nlinked to how the body has learnt to be in the world. This is indeed a cultural process in the \nsense discussed by Mauss as a \u2018technique of the body\u2019 (1973) that maybe acquired through \nparticular circumstances. It is not a sport that is acquired through ordinary engagement with peer \ngroups or participation through school or family as is the case with most traditional sports. \nRinehart & Sydnor (2003) have termed activities like windsurfing \u2018expressive\u2019 sports in contrast \nto the reward driven \u2018spectacle\u2019 sports, as they are rarely conducted for spectators or \ncompetitive practice, emphasising the aesthetic realm in which one blends with one\u2019s \nenvironment. Some windsurfers go so far as referring to their activities as art, or as a spiritual \nexperience: \n \nWe go down the beach and look out, [..] We admire their styles.. It\u2019s like going to an \nart exhibition and saying that\u2019s quite a good painting. \n \nSimilarly, in Parlebas\u2019s categorisation of modern sporting practices, he includes windsurfing in \nthe category of sports that he labels \u2018ludomotricit\u00e9\u2019, that is, they are characterised by the \npleasure achieved through the play activity itself (1999a: 225). The sorts of modern sport \npractices that he includes in this category are scramble-biking, hot-air ballooning, hang-gliding, \nsurfing and white-water canoeing. They have, he suggests, a series of features in common: they \ntake place in wild environments beyond social control and management; the subject acts as an \nindividual and interaction with others is not essential; the locomotive force is external to the \nbody, although the pleasure is in the motor and decision skill in relation to that force; they \ninvolve a visceral response to the normal mode of posture and movement which is thrown \nvertiginously into confusion (Parelbas 1999a: 228).  \nThere is a distinct \u2018praxeology\u2019 as Parlebas (1999a; b) and Warnier (2001) would have it, in \nwhich actions and objects entail each other and their relationships have a patterned quality that \nmust be acquired beyond the ordinary, routine acquisition of the cultural practices. This \nacquisition does not routinely occur within the habitus \u2013 unlike many ball games learnt casually \non the streets or in the playground \u2013 but must be acquired through the desire of the individual to \nseek out certain sensations and certain sub-cultural contexts. There she or he must acquire a \ncertain disposition in the body and take pleasure in the vertiginous sensations of speed, \nmovement and maintaining bodily control that is always close to being lost. To enter that sub-\ncultural group she or he must learn a distinctive series of smoothly linked together actions as \nresponses to sensations received through all the senses but most importantly the haptic and \nproprioceptive sensors. It is the praxeology of windsurfing that is extreme. \n \nThrill Seeking  \nAs we have argued, windsurfing is not an extreme sport in terms of danger. Nevertheless, as \nStranger (1999) points out in his analysis of the aesthetics of risk in high-risk leisure such as \nsurfing, there is a thrill involved with risk taking that is an important embodied aspect of these \nphysical experiences. Danger and excitement are fetishized in the \u2018go for it attitude\u2019 that \ncharacterises hard core windsurfing. Like surfers, climbers, and BASE jumpers, kite-surfing \nchallenges restrictions based on safety. Stranger is critical of sociological theories that attempt \nto explain this risk taking as reflective of rapid social changes - such as Gidden\u2019s (1991) \nreflexive risk managers. While acknowledging the attempt made by Elias & Dunning (1986) to \nrecognize the importance of the thrill experienced in sport, he is critical of their quest for \nexcitement thesis, which fails to explain individualistic pursuits conducted in the absence of a \ncrowd of spectators, nor the uncertain and at times dangerous nature of risk taking in these \nunregulated leisure forms such as wave windsurfing and certainly in the more dangerous sport \nof kite-surfing. In examining the aesthetic quality of surfing, Stranger argues that the search for \nthrill is part of a self-transcendence experience. He explores how accounts of the nature of the \nthrill in risk taking leisure activities often emphasize ecstatic feelings of oneness with the \nenvironment, the loss of self and intense awareness of the moment. He links this quest to the \n\u2018postmodern mode of aestheticization\u2019 because postmodern cultures involve an \u2018aesthetic of \nsensation replacing the increasingly impossible demands of modernity for rational interpretation\u2019 \n(1999: 270).  \nAs anthropologists Midol & Broyer (1995: 207) also observe, \u2018whizz\u2019 sports like windsurfing \nare \u2018playful practices\u2019 replacing the morality of guilt by a pleasure seeking grounded in the \u2018here \nand now.\u2019 In contrast to capitalism\u2019s temporal production, lifestyle sport time is immediate and \ndiscontinuous (Borden 2001). Participants are not concerned with their health, longevity and self \npreservation. Rather they seek a relationship between body and self that emphasises intense \nbut short-term experiences, and the \u2018inner\u2019 or \u2018felt\u2019 body \u2013 not the commodified, astheticised and \ndisciplined body that many describe as symptomatic and expressive of contemporary consumer \nculture. Obviously windsurfing bodies are subject to these processes as well, particularly the \ncommodification and sexualisation of female bodies, most conspicuous perhaps in the \nwindsurfing magazines and videos. But the unashamed display of the tanned, lean and fit outer-\nbody coexists with hedonistic pursuits of pleasure or self-actualisation (Laviolette Forthcoming). \n \nConclusions \nWe have argued in this paper that windsurfing is an extreme sport because it combines material, \nembodied and sub-cultural capital in ways that cannot be separated out. This brings into \nquestion Bourdieu\u2019s approach to the place of sport in culture in which various forms of capital \nare accrued that reflect social status; different forms of capital are passed on through the habitus \nin different ways and the transformation of one type of capital into another is often difficult to \nachieve within a lifetime. This may have worked for yachting and even dinghy sailing, but with \nwindsurfing the motivation and pleasure derived from participation is more direct (ludomotricit\u00e9) \nand status is oriented to participation within the sub-culture rather than to the society as a whole.  \nThe payoff for the accumulation of embodied and material capital, is the thrill and sensation \nthat is experienced by the individual as they interact \u2013 the distinctive \u2018praxeology\u2019 of the sport. \nThis mode of pleasure is aesthetic but not simply in an outward way. The experience of whizz \nand flow, the buzz and excitement can be appreciated both internally, as emotions are \nstimulated by physical sensation and externally within a social context in which such \nexperiences are shared. The sharing is guarded by strategies to exclude \u2013 sometimes \nunjustifiably \u2013 those who are not fully engaging in the activity because they are deemed to be \nlacking in the necessary material, embodied or sub-cultural capital. Nonetheless, it is the shared \nunderstanding of the windsurfing experience within the sub-culture of windsurfers that ultimately \ngives meaning to the distinctive merging of body, kit and environment. This turns windsurfing \ninto the extreme sport that it is.  \n \nReferences: \nBorden, I. 2001. Skateboarding space and the city: Architecture and the body.
