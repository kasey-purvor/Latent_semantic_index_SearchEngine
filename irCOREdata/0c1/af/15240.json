INTRODUCTION\nSoon after the first realization of Bose-Einstein condensa-\ntion \u0001BEC\u0002 in dilute atomic gases in 1995,1,2 the \u201catom chip\u201d\nemerged as one of the most promising device concepts for\nproduction and manipulation of matter wave systems not\nonly for basic studies but also for practical applications.3,4 To\ndate, the miniaturization of atom chips remains challenging,\nwith technological issues associated with small-scale elec-\ntronic, optical, and vacuum instrumentation.5 However, re-\ncently Kasprzak et al.6 have demonstrated BEC at 20 K for a\ngas of polaritons in a CdTe-based quantum well \u0001QW\u0002\nmicrocavity.6 Polaritons are mixed light-matter bosonic qua-\nsiparticles which result from the strong coupling between\nphoton modes confined in the microcavity and excitons con-\nfined in embedded quantum wells.7,8 Their extremely light\neffective mass, about 10\u22125 times the free electron mass, is\none of the key ingredients to achieve condensation at el-\nevated temperatures. The other important ingredient is to\nhave robust excitons at high carrier densities. In the CdTe-\nbased microcavities studied by Kasprzak et al.,6 the polariton\nBEC would only be possible below 60\u201380 K because the\nexciton binding energy is only 25 meV in CdTe QWs. In-\ncreasing the exciton binding energy with microcavities based\non wider-band-gap semiconductors, such as ZnO or GaN,\nshould extend operation up to room temperature or beyond.9\nInterestingly, BEC of polaritons was achieved with a strictly\nnonresonant optical excitation, which suggests that an elec-\ntrical injection of free carriers would be just as effective.\nThis opens up the prospect for a compact and practical \u201cBEC\non a chip\u201d and electronically pumped polariton lasers.8,9\nTo ensure the so-called strong-coupling regime in the mi-\ncrocavity, the interaction between the excitons and the pho-\nton modes should be larger than their respective damping\nlosses.8 For photons, this means that their lifetime in the\ncavity should be long enough, typically 1 ps for standard\nsemiconductors such as GaAs or CdTe. This would corre-\nspond to a cavity quality factor Q\u00021000, which could be\neasily satisfied with planar Fabry-Perot cavities using GaAs\nor CdTe and related materials, since the growth of high-\nquality Bragg mirrors is well controlled in these systems.\nUnfortunately, this is not the case for the nitride and oxide\nsystems, largely due to the large lattice mismatch combined\nwith the low refractive index contrast between members of\nthe same system \u0001GaN and AlN, for example\u0002.\nIn this paper we consider the use of devices of cylindrical\nsymmetry \u0001such as microdisks or microrods\u0002 as resonant\ncavities to avoid the challenging task of growing high-\nquality Bragg mirrors. We study coupling of strongly local-\nized whispering gallery modes with bulk excitons. The whis-\npering gallery modes in spheres or cylinders are known to\nhave quite long radiative lifetimes, which is highly advanta-\ngeous from the point of view of their application in polariton\ndevices. We show that indeed they can be strongly coupled\nwith bulk excitons even if they have a relatively low oscil-\nlator strength as is the case in GaAs. We discuss the pros and\ncons of cylindrical structures for realization of polariton la-\nsers and conclude that they have a number of advantages\nwith respect to planar microcavities.\nCylindrical microcavities of various design have been in-\nvestigated theoretically10\u201313 and experimentally,14\u201316 show-\ning a wide range of interesting physical effects, including the\nstrong exciton-light coupling of the low-orbital-index light\nmodes with excitons.\nThe aim of this work to investigate conditions under\nwhich strong coupling between bulk excitons and whispering\ngallery modes can be achieved. We analyze the radiative de-\ncay rates of the whispering gallery modes and show that\nthose modes which have lower decay rate can be strongly\ncoupled with bulk excitons. We demonstrate that due to the\nhigh quality factor of the whispering gallery modes their\nstrong coupling with excitons can indeed be observed. The\nstrength of the coupling is essentially independent of the\nradius of the cylinder, while the finesse of the cavity strongly\ndepends on it. We foresee high potentiality of the microcyl-\ninders and microdisks for realization of the polariton lasers.\nII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe optical eigenmodes of a single cylinder can be ob-\ntained by matching the components of the electromagnetic\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 75, 233309 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/75\u000123\u0002\/233309\u00014\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society233309-1\nfield at the surface of the cylinder using the usual Maxwell\nboundary conditions.10 An electromagnetic wave propagating\nperpendicularly to the cylinder\u2019s axis of symmetry can be\nrepresented as a superposition of two independent polarized\nmodes: the TM mode, for which the magnetic field is parallel\nto the cylindrical axis, and the TE mode, for which the elec-\ntric field is parallel to the axis. For an infinite cylinder of\nradius \u0003 with refractive index n1 surrounded by a medium of\nrefractive index n2, the frequencies of TE eigenmodes are\ngiven by the solution of\nn1Jm\u0001 \u0001n1K0\u0003\u0002Hm\n\u00011\u0002\u0001n2K0\u0003\u0002 \u2212 n2Jm\u0001n1K0\u0003\u0002Hm\n\u00011\u0002\u0001\u0001n2K0\u0003\u0002 = 0,\n\u00011a\u0002\nwhere K0=\u0004 \/c, \u0004=2\u0005f , Jm and Hm\u00011\u0002 are Bessel and Hankel\nfunctions of the first kind, and m is the azimuthal number of\nthe mode.\nFor the TM polarization, the eigenfrequencies can be ob-\ntained from\nn2Jm\u0001 \u0001n1K0\u0003\u0002Hm\n\u00011\u0002\u0001n2K0\u0003\u0002 \u2212 n1Jm\u0001n1K0\u0003\u0002Hm\n\u00011\u0002\u0001\u0001n2K0\u0003\u0002 = 0.\n\u00011b\u0002\nEquations \u00011a\u0002 and \u00011b\u0002 have complex roots, the imaginary\nparts of which determine the decay rate of the electromag-\nnetic fields of the eigenmodes.\nIf we consider a cylinder of refractive index n in air with\nradius \u0003 that is much larger than the wavelength of light in\nthis material and neglect decay, we can obtain a simplified\nequation for the eigenfrequencies:12\nn\u0004opt\u0003 =\n\u0005c\n2\n\u00012j + m \u00b1 1\/2\u0002 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere the \u0001 \u0001\u0006\u0002 sign corresponds to the TM \u0001TE\u0002 polariza-\ntion and j is an integer radial quantum number.\nOne can see that the minimum radius required for the\nappearance of a mode of frequency \u0004 with specific m \u0001which\nwill be referred to subsequently as the first mode\u0002 in the\ncylinder is given by\n\u0003 =\n\u0005c\n2n\u0004opt\n\u0001m \u00b1 1\/2\u0002 . \u00013\u0002\nFigure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows the radius of appearance of the first\nmodes for an energy 1.515 eV \u0001which corresponds to the\nexciton resonance in GaAs at 4 K\u0002 in a cylinder made of\nGaAs for various values of azimuthal number m. One can see\nthat the radius of appearance increases with increasing m.\nFor the strong-coupling regime, the optical mode of the\ncavity should have a decay rate that is less than the splitting\nbetween polariton modes. Figure 1\u0001b\u0002 shows the radiative\ndecay rate of the first mode for different values of azimuthal\nnumbers m which is seen to fall exponentially with increas-\ning m. Note that radiative decay remains finite since total\ninternal reflection does not occur for a cylindrical interface.11\nFor realization of the polariton devices, it is desirable that\nonly one optical mode interacts with the exciton, and it is\napparent from Eqs. \u00012\u0002 and \u00013\u0002 that the larger m, the more\nmodes with different m and j coexist in the close vicinity of\nthe first mode \u0001one having j=0\u0002 as Fig. 2 shows. The radia-\ntive decay of the mode rapidly increases with increasing ra-\ndial quantum number j, as one can see from Fig. 2. The first\nmode has the highest finesse and represents the case of most\ninterest for strong coupling with excitons and realization of\npolariton devices.\nThe eigenfrequencies of exciton-polariton modes of the\ncylindrical microcavity can be obtained from Eqs. \u00011a\u0002 and\n\u00011b\u0002 by including the excitonic contribution8 to the refractive\nindex n1 of the cylinder, so that\nn1\n2\n= \u0007 = \u0007b +\n\u0007b\u0004LT\n\u0004ex \u2212 \u0004 \u2212 i\b\n, \u00014\u0002\nwhere \u0007b is the background dielectric constant, \u0004ex is the\nexciton resonance frequency, \u0004LT is the bulk value of\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n(a)\n\u03b3\n(e\nV\n)\n\u03c1\n(n\nm\n)\nm\n(b)10-1\n10-2\n10-3\n10-4\n10-5\n10-6\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Dependence of the radius of the cylinder on the\nmode azimuthal number m when the first mode \u0001with radial quan-\ntum number j=0\u0002 has a photon energy at 1.515 eV.

One can see that, in the\nadopted approximation, the value of the Rabi splitting in the\ncylinder is equal to the bulk exciton-polariton Rabi splitting\nand does not depend on the indices j and m or on the radius\nof the cylinder. This result looks surprising, compared to the\nwell-known case of planar microcavities with quantum\nwells. However, it has a simple physical reason: the whisper-\ning gallery modes are strongly confined in the cylinder, so\nthat the penetration of the light field outside the cylinder is\nquite small. Equations \u00012\u0002 and \u00015\u0002 are obtained assuming full\nconfinement of the optical modes, which is an accurate as-\nsumption in the case of high j and m, as our numerical mod-\neling shows. The overlap integral of the cavity mode and the\nbulk exciton is close to 1, as in an infinite bulk semiconduc-\ntor, which is why the coupling constant in the cylinder ap-\npears to be equal to that of a bulk semiconductor. In planar\nmicrocavities containing quantum wells, this is not the case,\nas the overlap of the cavity mode with the quantum well is\nalways less than 1. Note that in the case of GaN-based cy-\nlindrical microcavity, the value of the Rabi splitting pre-\ndicted by Eq. \u00019a\u0002 would be about 70 meV, while for ZnO \t\ncould be as large as 150 meV, which exceeds substantially\nthe thermal energy corresponding to room temperature.\nWritten in the standard form for the two-coupled-\noscillator model, the equation for exciton-polariton eigenfre-\nquencies can be written as\n\u0001\u0004 \u2212 \u0004ex\u0002\u0001\u0004 \u2212 \u0004opt\u0002 \u2212 \u0001\t\/2\u00022 = 0. \u000110\u0002\nFigure 3\u0001a\u0002 shows the dependence of the eigenmode fre-\nquency on the radius of the cylinder in the vicinity of the\ncrossing point of the first mode with m=2 with the exciton\nresonance. The decay rate of the optical mode in this case is\n\f=0.028 eV, which is twice as large as the value of the Rabi\nsplitting \t, and hence the weak-coupling regime is obtained.\nThe decay rate of the first mode with m=3 is \f\n=0.005 eV, which is less than the value of the Rabi splitting\n\t.

The solid line shows the photon energy of the optical\nmode of the cylinder in the absence of the exciton.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 75, 233309 \u00012007\u0002\n233309-3\nThe decay rate of the first mode with m=4 is \f\n\u00030.001 eV, which is comparable with \b and much less than\nthe splitting \t. The anticrossing of the exciton and the opti-\ncal mode characteristic for the strong-coupling regime is\nclearly seen in Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002. For cylinders of larger radii, similar\nmode behavior can be obtained for larger radial and azi-\nmuthal mode numbers. However, as the finesse of the optical\nmodes at a given frequency decreases with increase of the\nradius of the cylinder, the single anticrossing seen in Fig.\n3\u0001c\u0002 would be replaced by multiple anticrossings between the\nexciton resonance and closely lying photon modes in this\ncase.\nUntil now we have considered an infinitely long cylinder.\nRealistic systems having a finite length can be divided into\ntwo classes: microrods, whose length is much more than the\ndiameter, and misrodisks, whose thickness is less than the\ndiameter.\nIn the case of a microrod, motion of a polariton along the\naxis of the rod is allowed. This provides the opportunity to\ntune the optical mode. In particular, in a photoluminescence\nexperiment, the frequency of photoluminescence will depend\non the angle between the axis of the rod and the direction of\ndetection. For a microrod the frequencies of the optical\neigen-modes having a zero wave vector along the axis of the\nrod are given by Eqs. \u00011a\u0002 and \u00011b\u0002 with good accuracy. The\ndispersion of the modes along the axis of the rod is para-\nbolic, with an effective mass dependent on the radius of the\nrod.\nIn the case of a microdisk, the background refractive in-\ndex of the cylinder should be replaced in the calculation by\nthe effective refractive index nef f of the mode of a planar\nwaveguide whose thickness is equal to that of the microdisk.\nAlternatively, the values \u0003disk of the radius of the microdisk\nrequired to observe the polariton anticrossing can be ob-\ntained by using the scaling relation\n\u0003disknef f = \u0003n1, \u000111\u0002\nwhere \u0003 are the radii obtained in the infinite cylinder model.\nAlso, in the case of a microdisk, there will be coupling of TE\nand TM modes, though this effect will be negligible in the\ncase of microdisks of large radius.\nFor both systems, the weak-strong coupling transition\ntakes place in accordance with the formalism developed\nabove, while for the microdisk an additional channel of ra-\ndiative decay along the axis should be accounted for in cal-\nculating the damping \f. The advantage of microdisks over\nmicrorods for realization of polariton lasers comes from the\nfact that the wave vector along the axis of the cylinder in no\nlonger a good quantum number in microdisks. Namely, it\nmay not be conserved during the scattering of polaritons with\nacoustic phonons, so that the phonon bottleneck effect,\nwhich makes observation of polariton BEC in planar micro-\ncavities more difficult, should not play any role in micro-\ndisks.\nIII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that the strong-\ncoupling regime for bulk exciton-polariton coupled to the\nwhispering gallery modes in GaAs microcylinders is indeed\npossible. This opens the way to observation of polariton las-\ning in GaAs-based microsystems. We expect that microdisks\nof wider-band-gap semiconductor materials, like GaN or\nZnO, would allow for realization of room-temperature polar-\niton lasers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was partially supported by the EPSRC.
