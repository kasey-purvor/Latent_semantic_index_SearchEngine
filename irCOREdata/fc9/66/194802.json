These\nmodels are in excellent agreement with the density, velocity-dispersion and anisotropy profiles\nof simulated dark matter haloes over their full resolved radial range. If \u0005 = 3 is a universal con-\nstant, some scatter in \u03b2 0 \u2248 0 may account for some diversity in the density profiles, provided\na relation \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r \u221d r\u2212\u03b1crit always holds.\nKey words: stellar dynamics \u2013 methods: analytical \u2013 galaxies: haloes \u2013 galaxies: structure.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nIt has long been recognized that N-body studies of large-scale struc-\nture formation in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies produce\ndark matter haloes whose density profiles are remarkably similar\nin shape over a wide range of halo virial mass (e.g. Dubinski &\nCarlberg 1991; Crone, Evrard & Richstone 1994; Navarro, Frenk\n& White 1996, 1997; Moore et al. 1999; Bullock et al. 2001).\nThis \u2018universal\u2019 halo density distribution is characterized by a rel-\natively shallow power-law behaviour in the inner parts, \u03c1 \u223c r\u2212\u03b3 ,\nwith \u03b3 \u2248 1 typically inferred at the smallest resolved radii, which\nsteepens gradually to an extrapolated \u03b3 \u2248 3\u20134 at arbitrarily large\nradii.\nA physical explanation, based on first principles, for the origin of\nsuch a profile is still lacking, and there has been some considerable\ndebate over the exact functional form implied by the numerical\nstudies. The fitting function most commonly applied has the general\n\u0001E-mail: walter.dehnen (WD); dean.mclaughlin@astro.le.ac.uk (DEM)\nform\n\u03c1(r ) \u221d r\u2212\u03b30 (rs + r )\u03b30\u2212\u03b3\u221e , (1)\nwhere \u03b3 0 and \u03b3 \u221e are the power-law slopes of the central cusp and\nin the limit r \u2192 \u221e, respectively, while rs is an appropriate scale\nradius. Dubinski & Carlberg (1991) originally suggested the Hern-\nquist (1990) profile, corresponding to \u03b3 0 = 1 and \u03b3\u221e = 4, while\nNavarro et al. (1996, 1997) argued for \u03b3 0 = 1 but \u03b3\u221e = 3 (the so-\ncalled \u2018NFW\u2019 profile). Subsequently, several studies have argued for\na somewhat steeper central cusp (e.g. Fukushige & Makino 1997,\n2001; Ghigna et al. 1998, 2000; Moore et al. 1998, 1999), with one\nrecent suite of high-resolution simulations appearing to imply \u03b3 0 \u0007\n1.16 \u00b1 0.14 (Diemand, Moore & Stadel 2004b). However, even\nthe highest resolution simulation to date (Diemand et al. 2005,\n\u03b3 0 = 1.2) can resolve the halo structure only to a fraction 10\u22123 of\nits virial radius, and this for a single halo only. Much more common\nare numerical resolution limits several times larger than that, leaving\nroom for the possibility that halo densities might become shallower\nthan r\u22121 at very small \u2018unobserved\u2019 radii (Taylor & Navarro 2001;\nPower et al. 2003; Fukushige, Kawai & Makino 2004; Hayashi et al.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1058 W.

(2004a,b), namely the six cluster-sized\nhaloes called A9, B9, C9, D12, E9 and F9 and the four galaxy-sized haloes called G0, G1, G2 and G3. The radial coordinate in each halo has been scaled by the\nradius r2 at which d ln \u03c1\/d ln r = \u22122 for that halo, and both ratios \u03c1\/\u03c3 3tot and \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r have been normalized by their respective values at r2. The lines in the upper\npanels are power-law fits to the scaled data from all 10 haloes combined. The average negative slope and its uncertainty are indicated. In the bottom panels, we\nshow the relative residuals [(\u03c1\/\u03c3 3) \u2212 (\u03c1\/\u03c3 3)fit]\/(\u03c1\/\u03c3 3). The rms residual is essentially the same (0.14\u20130.15) whether \u03c3tot or \u03c3 r is involved, although in the\nlatter case it is arguably distributed more uniformly about zero.\n2004), and perhaps. even tend to a finite density at r = 0 with no cusp\nat all (Stoehr et al. 2002; Navarro et al. 2004; Merritt et al. 2005).\nAlternatively, there might be no single, \u2018universal\u2019 density slope in\nthis limit (Fukushige et al. 2004; Navarro et al. 2004). At the other\nextreme, there are very few hard constraints on any limiting value of\nthe density slope as r \u2192 \u221e, as any halo is only well defined within\na finite virial radius.\nIn this paper, we examine the question of dark matter halo struc-\nture from a slightly different viewpoint, opting to derive \u03c1(r) from\na simple dynamical Ansatz, rather than fitting a pre-set family of\nfunctions to simulated density profiles. Our starting point is still\nempirical, however, being based on another surprisingly uniform\nproperty of N-body haloes. As was first noted and exploited by\nTaylor & Navarro (2001), the ratio of the density \u03c1(r) and the\ncube of the velocity dispersion \u03c3 (r) is a single power law in\nradius\n\u03c1(r )\/\u03c3 (r )3 \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 (2)\nover the full numerically resolved radial range. Taylor & Navarro\n(2001) originally found \u03b1 = 15\/8 = 1.875, which interestingly is the\nvalue predicted by the classic similarity solution for spherical sec-\nondary infall (Bertschinger 1985). They then used this constraint to\nsolve the Jeans equation numerically (assuming an isotropic veloc-\nity distribution) for \u03c1(r) and \u03c3 (r) separately. Although their result\nfor \u03c1(r) is not of the form (1) (it does tend to a shallow power law at\nthe centre but steepens rapidly outwards and falls to zero at a finite\nradius), Taylor & Navarro (2001) argued such a density distribution\nto be an adequate description of simulation data inside the virial ra-\ndius. Unfortunately, there is no exact analytical expression for \u03c1(r)\nin the case \u03b1 = 1.875, and this approach has not been used for fitting\nany data. Other studies have subsequently confirmed that \u03c1\/\u03c3 3 is a\npower law in radius, but estimates of the exponent differ somewhat\nfrom the Taylor\u2013Navarro value: \u03b1 = 1.95 or 1.90 \u00b1 0.05 according\nto Rasia, Tormen & Moscardini (2004) and Ascasibar et al. (2004),\nrespectively.\nOur main aim is to investigate in more detail the structure and dy-\nnamics of spherical dark matter haloes that follow a \u2018\u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation\u2019\nof the basic type given in equation (2), allowing at least initially\nfor arbitrary values of \u03b1. Thus, in Fig. 1 we show this relation as\ndefined by 10 CDM haloes simulated by Diemand, Moore & Stadel\n(2004a,b), the details of which were kindly provided to us by Ju\u00a8rg\nDiemand. These include four galaxy-sized haloes and six cluster-\nsized haloes, with virial masses ranging from 1012 to 1015 M\t. All\nare dynamically relaxed. The left-hand panels of Fig. 1 examine the\nratio \u03c1\/\u03c3 3tot as a function of radius in these haloes, where the total\none-dimensional velocity dispersion is \u03c3 2tot \u2261 1\/3(\u03c3 2r + \u03c3 2\u03b8 + \u03c3 2\u03c6 ).\nThe right-hand panels look at the quantity \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r versus r, where\n\u03c3r is the velocity dispersion in the radial direction only. Power-\nlaw fits to each of these profiles are drawn, and the residuals from\nthe fits are shown in the bottom panels. These demonstrate that\nthe ratio \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r follows a power law in radius at least as closely\nas \u03c1\/\u03c3 3tot does, although the fitted slopes differ slightly between\nthe two cases. Fits for each of the 10 haloes individually yield\npower-law slopes that can differ by \u00b14 per cent from the average\nvalues in Fig. 1. Whether this scatter is real or simply a reflec-\ntion of numerical uncertainties is unclear, but it is certainly rather\nmodest.\nTo the extent that either of the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relations illustrated in Fig. 1\nis \u2018universal\u2019, and in so far as dark matter haloes are in equilibrium,\nimposing a dynamical constraint along the lines of equation (2)\nto solve the spherical Jeans equation, as Taylor & Navarro (2001)\noriginally did, should lead directly to a \u2018universal\u2019 density profile.\nWhile we have no physical argument for the fundamental origin of\nthe precise power-law behaviour in Fig. 1 (though clearly it must\nbe related to the initial conditions and the formation via violent\nrelaxation), it is much simpler to characterize than the density profile\nitself. Moreover, a Jeans equation approach allows explicitly for\na simultaneous exploration of velocity anisotropy inside haloes \u2013\nan issue which to date has been largely divorced from empirical\ndescriptions of the halo density profiles.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 363, 1057\u20131068\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nDynamical insight into dark matter haloes 1059\nIt is well known that the velocity distributions in dark matter\nhaloes are not isotropic. We characterize velocity anisotropy using\nBinney\u2019s parameter\n\u03b2(r ) = 1 \u2212 \u03c3\n2\n\u03b8 + \u03c3 2\u03c6\n2\u03c3 2r\n, (3)\nsuch that 0 < \u03b2 \u0001 1 corresponds to radial anisotropy and \u03b2 < 0\nsignifies a tangentially biased velocity distribution. It is typically\nfound that \u03b2 \u2248 0 (isotropy) at the centres of haloes and gradually\nincreases outwards (reflecting radial anisotropy), reaching levels of\n\u03b2 \u2248 0.5 around the virial radius (e.g. Col\u0131\u00b4n, Klypin & Kravtsov\n2000; Fukushige & Makino 2001). Indeed, it has been suggested\n(Cole & Lacey 1996; Carlberg et al. 1997) that there exists a \u2018uni-\nversal\u2019 anisotropy profile in dark matter haloes. Very closely re-\nlated to such an idea is the recent claim by Hansen & Moore\n(2005), that \u03b2(r) depends roughly linearly on the logarithmic density\ngradient\n\u03b3 (r ) \u2261 \u2212(d ln \u03c1\/d ln r ) (4)\nwith essentially the same, constant slope d\u03b2\/d\u03b3 holding for a variety\nof end-products of violent relaxation processes (merger remnants,\ndark matter haloes and collapse remnants).\nWith these points particularly in mind, we base our analysis on the\nassumption that halo density and the radial component of velocity\ndispersion \u03c3r (rather than \u03c3 tot) are connected through a power-law\nrelation of the general form\n\u03c1\n\u03c3 \u0005r\n(r ) = \u03c10\n\u03c3 \u0005r ,0\n(\nr\nr0\n)\u2212\u03b1\n, (5)\nwhere r0 is any convenient reference radius, \u03c1 0 = \u03c1(r 0) and \u03c3 r,0 =\n\u03c3r (r 0). Intuitively, as well as on the basis of Fig. 1, it seems most\nnatural to expect the exponent \u0005 in this equation to be \u0005 = 3; but it\nadds little complication to allow for the possibility (Hansen 2004)\nthat a slightly different value might provide a still more accurate\ndescription of simulated haloes. The choice of \u03c3r as the velocity\ndispersion to work with is arguably more natural than \u03c3 tot, since\n\u03b2(r) and \u03c3r appear separately in the spherical Jeans equation but\n\u03c3 2tot = \u03c3 2r (1 \u2212 2\u03b2\/3). Technically, this choice ultimately allows for\na more tractable inclusion of velocity anisotropy; empirically, it is\nobviously well justified by Fig. 1.\nWe begin in Section 2 with an investigation into which spherical\ndensity profiles satisfy the Jeans equation and obey the Ansatz (5)\nunder the restrictions of velocity isotropy (\u03b2 \u2261 0 and \u03c3 tot \u2261 \u03c3r ) and a\nfixed \u0005 = 3. The problem is then identical to the one first considered\nby Taylor & Navarro (2001), and our approach is rooted in theirs,\nbut we also draw on some aspects of the considerations by Williams\net al. (2004). However, unlike these authors, we explore the full\nsolution space of the problem. We find that only very few of the\nmany possible solutions correspond to realistic density models for\nsimulated dark matter haloes, and in fact only one solution, which\noccurs for a \u2018critical\u2019 value of \u03b1, is of practical importance.\nWe then proceed in Section 3 to consider the more realistic case of\nanisotropic velocity distributions and allow for general values of \u0005\nin equation (5). We show that in the case of an anisotropy parameter\n\u03b2 that depends linearly on \u03b3 (including constant anisotropy as a\nspecial case), and for any \u0005, the solutions of the Jeans equation\nunder our adopted constraint are exact analogues of those in the\n\u03b2 \u2261 0, \u0005 = 3 case. In particular, for each pair [\u0005, \u03b2(r = 0)] only one\nphysical solution of practical relevance exists, which again occurs\nat a \u2018critical\u2019 \u03b1 value. These solutions have fully analytical density,\nmass and velocity-dispersion profiles with power-law asymptotes at\nsmall and large radii.\nIn Section 4, we compare our analytical profiles to the \u2018observed\u2019\ndensity, velocity-dispersion and anisotropy profiles in haloes simu-\nlated by Diemand et al. (2004a,b, 2005), finding good agreement in\ngeneral. Finally, Section 5 discusses our findings and summarizes\nthe paper.\n2 T H E I S OT RO P I C C A S E\nOur underlying assumption is that some version of the general \u03c1\u2013\u03c3\nrelation in equation (5) holds for dark matter haloes. Before allowing\nfor this level of generality, however, there is much insight to be\ngained from beginning with a more specialized case, in which the\nvelocity distribution is isotropic and \u0005 = 3. Then, as in Taylor &\nNavarro (2001), Williams et al. (2004) and Hansen (2004), we have\n\u03c1\n\u03c3 3r\n= \u03c10\n\u03c3 3r ,0\n(\nr\nr0\n)\u2212\u03b1\n.

Following Taylor & Navarro (2001),\nwe solve equation (6) for\u03c3r, insert it in equation (7), and differentiate\nagain to obtain\n1\nx2 y\nd\ndx\n[\nx2\ny\nd\ndx\n(y5\/3x2\u03b1\/3)\n]\n= \u2212\u03ba. (8)\nHere, x \u2261 r\/r 0 and y \u2261 \u03c1\/\u03c1 0 are dimensionless variables, and\n\u03ba \u2261 4\u03c0G\u03c10r 20\n\/\n\u03c3 2r ,0 (9)\nis a dimensionless measure of the velocity-dispersion scale.\nTaylor & Navarro (2001) studied the solutions of equation (8) for\nthe particular value \u03b1 = 15\/8 by numerical integration. It proves\nuseful, however, to first rewrite the problem in terms of the (nega-\ntive) logarithmic density slope \u03b3 (r), as defined in (4). Equation (8)\nthen reads\n\u03b3 \u2032 \u2212 23 (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a) (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b) = 35 \u03bax2\u22122\u03b1\/3 y1\/3, (10)\nwhere a prime denotes differentiation with respect to ln x and\n\u03b3a = 25 \u03b1, \u03b3b = \u03b1 + 32 . (11)\nThe objective of this section is to investigate the solution space of\nequation (10). First, note that its right-hand side becomes constant\nfor y = x\u2212\u03b31 , with\n\u03b31 = 6 \u2212 2\u03b1. (12)\nIn fact, as was already noted by Taylor & Navarro (2001), this sin-\ngular density profile is a solution to equation (10) and, for \u03b1 =\n2 corresponds to the well-known singular isothermal sphere. For\n3\/2 < \u03b1 < 5\/2 (which covers our regime of interest; see Fig. 1\nabove),\n\u03b3a < \u03b31 < \u03b3b (13)\nand thus, following Taylor & Navarro (2001), we choose to identify\nthe reference radius r0 in equation (6) as that at which the (negative)\ndensity slope equals \u03b3 1, that is, \u03b3 1 = \u03b3 (x = 1). In this way, r0 is\nwell defined for all realistic solutions.1 Moreover, it is then obvious\n1 As we will see, for some solutions \u03b3 (r ) = \u03b31 at more than just one radius.\nIn this case, we pick that radius which in addition maximizes \u03b3 \u2032.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 363, 1057\u20131068\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1060 W.

Flow diagrams of equation (14), describing isotropic density profiles with \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r \u221d r\u2212\u03b1 , in the (\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u2032) phase space (the length of the arrows has been\nnormalized for ease of reading) for three different values of \u03b1. The flow vanishes at the three fixed points (dots), where \u03b3 \u2032 = 0 and \u03b3 is a root of the right-hand\nside of equation (14). Some solutions to equation (14) are given as curves. Physical solutions to the original equation (10) must lie above the (dashed) parabola\nwhich is defined in equation (15). Solutions with \u03b3 \u2032 < 0 or \u03b3 < 0 at any point (red and magenta curves) are unrealistic. There is exactly one realistic and\nphysical solution for every \u03b1 \u0001 35\/18 (blue curve) and none for larger \u03b1. At small radii this solution\u2019s density profile approaches the power law \u03c1 \u221d r\u22122\u03b1\/5,\nwhile at large radii the density is truncated at a finite radius for \u03b1 < 35\/18, and approaches \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b1\u22123\/2 = r\u221231\/9 for \u03b1 = 35\/18.\nfrom this equation that the constant \u03ba is effectively a measure of \u03b3 \u2032\nat x = 1.\nLet us now consider equation (10) in some detail, in particu-\nlar the possible behaviour of any solutions at very small and large\nradii (see also Williams et al. 2004). It is straightforward to verify\nthat in the limit r \u2192 0 only three asymptotes are possible: either\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3a (both sides of the equation vanish, so long as \u03b1 < 5\/2); or\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b31 (both sides approach a constant); or the density has a central\nhole with y \u2261 0 inside a non-zero radius (note that \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 b is not\npossible, since the right-hand side would then diverge for \u03b1 > 3\/2).2\nOf these three, the latter is unrealistic, whereas \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b31 is incon-\nsistent with simulated haloes, which have shallower inner density\nslopes. This leaves \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3a as the only interesting option. We thus\nexpect that, for any given value of \u03b1, there exists one solution with\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3a as r \u2192 0. The solution with this limiting behaviour is asso-\nciated with a unique value of \u03ba , which depends on \u03b1 through equa-\ntion (10). In fact, this very case corresponds to the \u2018critical \u03ba\u2019 so-\nlution developed by Taylor & Navarro (2001) for their specified\n\u03b1 = 15\/8.\nIn the limit r \u2192 \u221e, also only three possible asymptotes exist:\neither \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 b (both sides of the equation vanish, if \u03b1 > 3\/2), or\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b31 (both sides approach a constant again), or the density has\nan outer truncation with y \u2261 0 beyond a finite radius (note that\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3a is not possible, as the right-hand side then diverges if\n\u03b1 < 5\/2). All of these three are physically meaningful (apart from\nthe fact that for \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b31 the mass formally diverges, similarly to the\nisothermal sphere). The \u2018critical \u03ba\u2019 solution of Taylor & Navarro\n(2001) for \u03b1 = 15\/8 is one with an outer truncation.\nIn order to gain more insight into the solution space of equa-\ntion (10), we now follow Williams et al. (2004) and differentiate it\nyet again (with respect to ln x) to obtain\n\u03b3 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2032[\u03b3 \u2212 1\/3(2\u03b3a + 2\u03b3b \u2212 \u03b31)]=2\/9(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b31),\n(14)\n2 Hansen (2004), in his analysis of the same problem, mentions the asymptote\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b31 in the limit r \u2192 0, but misses the important possibility \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3a .\nequivalent to their equation (2.2). In Fig. 2, we plot flow diagrams\nof the (\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u2032) phase space for three representative values of \u03b1. The\ndashed parabola in each panel corresponds to\n\u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3 \u2032min \u2261 2\/3(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a) (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b). (15)\nWhile this actually is a solution to (14), as already discovered by\nWilliams et al. (2004), it is not a valid solution to the original, phys-\nical problem. This is because the constant \u03ba > 0 by definition, so\nequation (10) requires that \u03b3 \u2032 \u0002 \u03b3 \u2032min in order for its right-hand\nside to be non-negative. In fact, the equality \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3 \u2032min is only al-\nlowed in either of the limits \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3a as r \u2192 0 or \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 b as\nr \u2192\u221e (see the discussion above). Similarly, any solutions below the\nparabola (15) require \u03ba < 0 and are unphysical. By contrast, all\nsolutions above the parabola (15) correspond to potentially viable\nsolutions of the original equation (10).\nIn all the panels of Fig. 2, the flow vanishes at the three fixed\npoints (\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u2032) = (\u03b3a , 0), (\u03b31, 0) and (\u03b3 b, 0), which are plotted\nas blue dots. The central fixed point is stable and corresponds to\nthe singular solution y = x\u2212\u03b31 discussed above. Solutions with\n\u03b3 \u2032\u2032 > 0 (arrows pointing upwards) at any \u03b3 > \u03b31 approach, in the\nlimit \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, the upper right branch of the parabola \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3 \u2032 min. This\ncorresponds to the case, discussed above, of an outer truncation to\nthe density. More precisely, integrating equation (15) twice yields\nthe asymptotic density profile\n\u03c1 \u2192 r\u2212\u03b3b [r 2(\u03b3b\u2212\u03b3a )\/3t \u2212 r 2(\u03b3b\u2212\u03b3a )\/3]3\/2 (16)\nas r approaches some finite radius r t. For r \u0002 r t, \u03c1 \u2261 0. Con-\nversely, solutions with \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 < 0 (arrows pointing downwards) at any\n\u03b3 < \u03b31 approach, in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, the upper left branch of\nthe parabola. This corresponds to the case, mentioned above, of an\ninner truncation, with the asymptotic density profile\n\u03c1 \u2192 r\u2212\u03b3a [r 2(\u03b3a\u2212\u03b3b )\/3h \u2212 r 2(\u03b3a\u2212\u03b3b )\/3]3\/2 (17)\nas r approaches some radius r h > 0. For r \u0001 r h, \u03c1 \u2261 0. Thus solutions\nfor which \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e at large radii have a finite outer truncation radius,\nand solutions for which \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u221e at small radii have a finite-sized\ninner hole. These latter solutions are clearly unrealistic and also\nunphysical (the isotropic distribution function must become negative\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 363, 1057\u20131068\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nDynamical insight into dark matter haloes 1061\nto account for the hole). Furthermore, solutions that ever visit \u03b3 \u2032 < 0\nare hardly realistic (their density profiles become shallower towards\nlarger radii, at least over some radial range).\nApart from this \u2013 as Williams et al. (2004) have also noted \u2013\nthe generic behaviour of the solutions to equation (14) depends on\nwhether \u03b1 is greater than, less than, or equal to a critical value\n\u03b1crit for which the inner and outer fixed points, \u03b3a and \u03b3 b, are\nequidistant from the central \u03b31. Referring to equations (11) and\n(12), \u03b31 = 1\/2(\u03b3a + \u03b3b) requires \u03b1crit = 35\/18 = 1.94.\nThe behaviour of the solutions for \u03b1 > \u03b1crit is exemplified in the\nright-hand panel of Fig. 2. The solutions are split into two fami-\nlies by the one (upper magenta), which ends at the fixed point at\n\u03b3 = \u03b3 b, so that \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b3b as r \u2192 \u221e. Solutions lying above this\ncurve correspond to density profiles with a central hole and an outer\ntruncation; those below usually also have a central hole but at larger\nradii perform damped \u2018oscillations\u2019 about \u03b3 = \u03b31, eventually ap-\nproaching \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b31 as r \u2192 \u221e. All of these solutions are unrealistic,\nsince they possess inner density holes. The only exception is a lim-\niting solution (lower magenta) which starts from the fixed point at\n\u03b3 = \u03b3a (i.e. \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b3a as r \u2192 0) and slowly approaches \u03b3 = \u03b31 as\nr \u2192 \u221e. However, this solution is still not a viable description of\ndark matter haloes, since its density profile is too shallow at large\nradii.\nThe behaviour of the solutions when \u03b1 < \u03b1crit is illustrated in the\nleft-hand panel of Fig. 2 for \u03b1 = 15\/8, the case previously studied by\nTaylor & Navarro (2001). The situation is in some sense a mirrored\nversion of that for \u03b1 > \u03b1crit. The solution space is again divided into\ntwo families, now by the solution (blue) starting from the left fixed\npoint at \u03b3 = \u03b3a at r = 0. Solutions above this once again correspond\nto density profiles with a central hole and an outer truncation; those\nbelow it start from an \u2018oscillation\u2019 about the power law \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b31\nin the limit r \u2192 0, eventually steepening outwards and generally\nbeing truncated at a finite large radius. The limit of this family is\nthe solution (magenta) which instead of an outer truncation has a\npower-law fall-off with \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b3b as r \u2192 \u221e.\nFor any \u03b1 < \u03b1crit, the (blue) solution separating the two families\njust described is a potentially realistic model for dark matter haloes,\nstarting as it does from a shallow power-law cusp \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b3a at r \u2192\n0 (with \u03b3a = 2\u03b1\/5 < 7\/9 for \u03b1 < 35\/18) and steepening outwards\nto reach \u03c1 = 0 at a finite radius. This is the model identified by\nTaylor & Navarro (2001) as their \u2018critical \u03ba\u2019 solution in the specific\ncase \u03b1 = 15\/8. Given this \u03b1, numerical integration of equation (14)\noutward from \u03b3 = \u03b3a = 3\/4 at x = 0 yields \u03ba = 2.674, to be\ncompared with the value \u03ba = 2.678 found by Taylor & Navarro\n(2001) through trial-and-error integration of equation (8) starting\nfrom x = 1.\nThe middle panel of Fig. 2 depicts the special situation \u03b1 = \u03b1crit,\nfor which the flow in (\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u2032) phase space is symmetric with respect\nto the transformation r \u2192 r\u22121 and \u03b3 \u2192 2\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b3 (because \u03b3a +\n\u03b3 b = 2\u03b31 by definition of \u03b1crit). In this case, there exists a first\nintegral,\nK = [\u03b3 \u2032 + 1\/6(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b)][\u03b3 \u2032 \u2212 2\/3(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b)]4\n(18)\nwhich is conserved by any solution of equation (14) with \u03b1 = \u03b1crit.\nIn particular, K = 0 for the solution \u03b3 \u2032 = \u03b3 \u2032min(\u03b3 ) [see equation (15)]\nand also for\n\u03b3 \u2032 = \u22121\/6(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b), (19)\nwhich is plotted as the blue curve in the middle panel of Fig. 2. It\nagain divides the solution space into two, although now solutions\nabove the curve (19) always have both an inner hole and an outer\ntruncation to the density profile, while solutions below the curve\nundergo undamped \u2018oscillations\u2019 about \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b31 , never settling to\nan asymptote in either limit r \u2192 0 or r \u2192 \u221e.\nThe solution (19) for \u03b1 = \u03b1crit = 35\/18 is particularly appeal-\ning since it starts from a shallow power law \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3a = 7\/9 in\nthe limit r \u2192 0 and tends to the steeper \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 b = 31\/9 as\nr \u2192 \u221e. The combination of these features is reminiscent of dark\nmatter haloes. This single solution with \u03b1 = \u03b1crit is the only one, of\nall the solutions for any \u03b1, whose density has both inner and outer\npower-law asymptotes and monotonically increasing \u03b3 . It is also\nthe only one we have found which is simple enough that almost all\nits physical properties can be developed analytically: equation (19)\nis easily integrated to give \u03b3 (x) and subsequently y(x) \u221d \u03c1(r ) as\nsimple functions, which then allows us to evaluate \u03c3r (r ), the en-\nclosed mass profile M(r), and the circular velocity Vc(r ).\nTo aid in obtaining these basic results, we first substitute equa-\ntion (19) into equation (10) and evaluate the result at x = y = 1\n(where \u03b3 = \u03b31 by definition) to find\n\u03ba = 25\n18\n(\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3b \u2212 \u03b31) = 20081 (20a)\n(for \u03b1 = \u03b1crit). With this in hand, we obtain\n\u03c1(r ) = 5\n9\nMtot\n\u03c0r 30\nx\u22127\/9(1 + x4\/9)\u22126, (20b)\n\u03b3 (r ) = (7\/9) + (31\/9x\n4\/9)\n1 + x4\/9 , (20c)\n\u03c3 2r (r ) =\n9\n40\nG Mtot\nr0\nx\u22121\n(\nx4\/9\n1 + x4\/9\n)4\n, (20d)\nM(r ) = Mtot\n(\nx4\/9\n1 + x4\/9\n)5\n, (20e)\nV 2c (r ) =\nG Mtot\nr0\nx\u22121\n(\nx4\/9\n1 + x4\/9\n)5\n, (20f)\nwhere x \u2261 r\/r 0 as usual. We have replaced \u03c1 0 with the total mass\nM tot = (576\u03c0\/5) \u03c1 0r 30; and the value of \u03ba in equation (20a) has been\nused with the basic definition (9) to eliminate the normalization\n\u03c3 r,0 from equation (20d). Note that, because this solution has a\nfinite total mass, both \u03c3 2r (r ) and V 2c(r ) fall off as r\u22121 in the limit\nr \u2192 \u221e. At the same time, both quantities vanish at r = 0, and thus\neach profile peaks at a finite radius. This happens at x = (7\/9)9\/4\nfor \u03c3 2r (r ), and at x = (11\/9)9\/4 for V 2c(r ). Finally, the gravitational\npotential follows from integrating d\u000b\/dr = GM(r )\/r 2:\n\u000b(r ) = \u22129\n4\nG Mtot\nr0\nB 1\n1+x4\/9\n(\n9\n4\n,\n11\n4\n)\n(20g)\nwhere Bu(p, q) \u2261\n\u222b u\n0 t\np\u22121(1 \u2212 t)q\u22121dt is the incomplete beta func-\ntion (e.g. Press et al. 1992, Section 6.4). For an alternative form and\nasymptotic limits of \u000b, see equation (40i) and the following text.\nApart from its convenient and unique analytical properties, this\nsolution of the Jeans equation is additionally of interest because\nit corresponds to a \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation of the type in equation (6) with\n\u03b1 = \u03b1crit = 1.94, remarkably close to the exponent actually found\nfor the simulated dark matter haloes shown in Fig. 1 above.

McLaughlin\nequation (8) or (10) for this restricted case, it turns out to be\nstraightforward to allow for realistic velocity anisotropies and at\nthe same time investigate other values of \u0005 in the full \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation\nof equation (5). As we will now show, the specialized isotropic so-\nlution of equation (20) is in fact just one of a larger, more general\nfamily of analytical solutions to the Jeans equation.\n3 T H E A N I S OT RO P I C C A S E\nWe now return to the more general form of our basic assumption (5),\nnamely\n\u03c1\n\u03c3 \u0005r\n(r ) = \u03c10\n\u03c3 \u0005r ,0\n(\nr\nr0\n)\u2212\u03b1\n,\nand seek to solve the spherical Jeans equation in the general form\nd\ndr\n\u03c1\u03c3 2r +\n2\u03b2(r )\nr\n\u03c1\u03c3 2r = \u2212\u03c1(r )\nG M(r )\nr 2\n(21)\nwith anisotropy parameter \u03b2 as defined in equation (3). By the same\nmethod as in the last section, we then find the generalization of\nequation (10) to be(\n\u03b3 \u2032 \u2212 2\u0005\n2 + \u0005 \u03b2\n\u2032\n)\n\u2212 2\n\u0005\n(\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u0005\n2\n)(\n\u03b3 \u2212 2\u0005\n2 + \u0005 \u03b2 \u2212\n2\u03b1\n2 + \u0005\n)\n= \u0005\n2 + \u0005 \u03bax\n2\u22122\u03b1\/\u0005 y1\u22122\/\u0005 . (22)\nDifferentiating again to obtain the equivalent of equation (14) leads\nto a number of non-linear terms involving up to the second derivative\n\u03b2 \u2032\u2032, including cross-terms of the type \u03b3 \u03b2 \u2032 and \u03b2\u03b3 \u2032. These terms\ncancel exactly, however, if and only if \u03b2 depends linearly on \u03b3 .\nThat is, the structure of the Jeans equation itself naturally suggests\nthat we stipulate the relationship\n\u03b2 = \u03b20 + b(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a), (23)\nfor b and \u03b3a constants. The definition of \u03b3a follows from substituting\nthe expression (23) into equation (22), yielding\n\u03b3 \u2032 \u2212 2\n\u0005\n(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a) (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b) = \u00052 + \u0005 \u2212 2\u0005b \u03bax\n2\u22122\u03b1\/\u0005 y1\u22122\/\u0005, (24)\nif\n\u03b3a = 2\u03b12 + \u0005 +\n2\u0005\n2 + \u0005 \u03b20. (25)\nHere x and y are defined as in Section 2, while \u03ba is given in equa-\ntion (9) and\n\u03b3b = \u03b1 + \u00052 . (26)\nEquation (24) is thus the generalization of equation (10) for arbitrary\n\u0005 and \u03b2 linearly dependent on \u03b3 (for \u0005 = 3 and \u03b2 0 = b = 0, the\ntwo equations are identical). Note that b < (2 + \u0005)\/2\u0005 is required\nto keep the right-hand side of equation (24) non-negative.\nAnother differentiation of equation (24) with respect to ln x yields\nthe generalization of equation (14):\n\u03b3 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 6 \u2212 \u0005\n\u0005\n\u03b3 \u2032\n[\n\u03b3 \u2212 2\u03b3a + 2\u03b3b \u2212 (\u0005 \u2212 2)\u03b31\n6 \u2212 \u0005\n]\n= 2(\u0005 \u2212 2)\n\u00052\n(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b31) (27)\nwith\n\u03b31 = 2(\u0005 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\u0005 \u2212 2 . (28)\nAgain, the singular function \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b31 is a solution, also identified\nby Hansen (2004). As long as\n\u0005 > 2 (29)\nto avoid fundamental changes in sign, the only differences between\nequations (27) and (14) are in numerical values of constants in-\ncluding \u03b3a , \u03b3 b and \u03b31. The topology of the (\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u2032) phase space for\ngeneral \u0005 > 2 with anisotropy parametrized as in (23) is thus the\nsame as for the isotropic case with \u0005 = 3, and mathematically the\nsolution spaces of the two problems are isomorphic. Hence, most\nof the discussion around Fig. 2 carries over here. In particular, for\nany given \u0005 > 2 and \u03b2 0 \u0001 1, the fixed points of equation (24) at \u03b3a\nand \u03b3 b satisfy \u03b3a < \u03b3 b, and they bracket the third fixed point at \u03b31\nas long as\n3 \u2212 \u0005\n2\n< \u03b1 <\n2 + \u0005\n2\n\u2212 \u0005 \u2212 2\n2\n\u03b20. (30)\nAs before, there then exists a critical value of \u03b1 for which the three\nfixed points are equally spaced: with the requirement \u03b31 = 1\/2(\u03b3a +\n\u03b3b), equations (25), (26) and (28) give\n\u03b1crit = (10 \u2212 \u0005)(2 + \u0005)2(6 + \u0005) \u2212\n2(\u0005 \u2212 2)\n6 + \u0005 \u03b20, (31)\nwhich notably does not depend on the slope b in the linear \u03b2\u2013\u03b3\nrelation of equation (23). With \u0005 = 3 and \u03b2 0 = 0, we have \u03b1crit =\n35\/18 as in the previous section.\nThe generic characteristics of the various solutions to equa-\ntion (27) are again determined by whether \u03b1 < \u03b1crit, \u03b1 = \u03b1crit,\nor \u03b1 > \u03b1crit (see Fig. 2). For any constant anisotropy (\u03b2 0 \u0001 1\nand b = 0 in equation 23), the division between physical and un-\nphysical solutions in all three cases is exactly analogous to the\nisotropic specialization of Section 2. When a gradient in \u03b2(r) is\nallowed, however, the number of physical solutions to the problem\nbecomes smaller, because \u03b2 is bounded above by 1 at all radii.\nIn particular, for the most relevant case of b > 0 (correspond-\ning, for realistic halo models, to an outwardly increasing radial\nanisotropy), \u03b3 must also be bounded above, and the solutions with\nan outer truncation to the density profile (\u03b3 \u2192 \u221e) are no longer\nviable. As a consequence, the only physically possible solutions\nwith a shallow density cusp in the centre and monotonically in-\ncreasing slope \u03b3 are the analytical solutions that occur only for \u03b1 =\n\u03b1crit.\nSetting \u03b1 = \u03b1crit in equation (27) reduces it to\n\u03b3 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 6 \u2212 \u0005\n\u0005\n\u03b3 \u2032 (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b31) = 2(\u0005 \u2212 2)\n\u00052\n(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b31)\n(32)\nwith\n\u03b3a(\u03b1crit) = 10 \u2212 \u00056 + \u0005 +\n2(\u0005 + 2)\n6 + \u0005 \u03b20, (33a)\n\u03b31(\u03b1crit) = 10 + 3\u00056 + \u0005 +\n4\n6 + \u0005 \u03b20, (33b)\n\u03b3b(\u03b1crit) = 10 + 7\u00056 + \u0005 \u2212\n2(\u0005 \u2212 2)\n6 + \u0005 \u03b20.

Fig. 2). The other is\n\u03b3 \u2032 = \u2212 \u0005 \u2212 2\n2\u0005\n(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3a)(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3b), (35)\nwhich is easily integrated to give an analytic expression for y(x) \u221d\n\u03c1(r ).3 Before writing down this and other quantities, it proves useful\nto introduce the auxiliary parameter\n\u03b7 \u2261 \u0005 \u2212 2\n2\u0005\n(\u03b3b \u2212 \u03b3a) = 2 (\u0005 \u2212 2)(2 \u2212 \u03b20)6 + \u0005 , (36a)\nthe meaning of which becomes clear below. Then\n\u0005 = 2 4 + 3\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b20\n4 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b20 , (36b)\nso we have from equation (31) that\n\u03b1crit = \u03b7 + 2 \u2212 4\u03b74 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212 2\u03b20 , (36c)\nand from equation (33),\n\u03b30 \u2261 \u03b3a(\u03b1crit) = 1 \u2212 \u03b7\/2 + \u03b20, (36d)\n\u03b31(\u03b1crit) = 2 + \u03b7\/4 + \u03b20\/2, (36e)\n\u03b3\u221e \u2261 \u03b3b(\u03b1crit) = 3 + \u03b7. (36f)\nIntegrating equation (35), we then find for the density\n\u03c1(r ) \u221d x\u2212\u03b30 (1 + x\u03b7)\u2212(\u03b3\u221e\u2212\u03b30)\/\u03b7. (37)\nThus, the parameter \u03b7 governs the speed of the transition between\nthe power-law asymptotes \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b30 at small radii and \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b3\u221e\nat large radii.4 In addition, the constant \u03b2 0 in equation (23) takes\non physical meaning as the velocity anisotropy at the centre of the\ndensity distribution.\nAstonishingly, the gradient b \u2261 d\u03b2\/d\u03b3 in equation (23) does\nnot appear in equation (27) or any subsequent relations, implying\nthat the influence of anisotropy on the density profile is entirely\ndetermined by the situation in the centre, if \u03b2 depends linearly on\n\u03b3 as we have assumed. For any fixed \u0005 > 2, the main effect of a\nradially biased velocity ellipsoid at the centre (0 < \u03b2 0 \u0001 1) is to\nsteepen the inner power law \u03b3 0 relative to its isotropic value, and\nmake \u03b3 \u221e smaller, that is, the outer density profile shallower. The\nreverse holds for a tangential anisotropy, \u03b2 0 < 0. In order to keep\n\u03b3 0 \u0002 0 then (so the density does not decrease towards r \u2192 0), we\nrequire\n\u03b20 \u0002 (\u0005 \u2212 10)\/(4 + 2\u0005), (38)\n3 Note that in the limit \u0005 = 2, equation (35) is simply \u03b3 \u2032 = 0, while\nequation (31) gives \u03b1crit = 2 for any \u03b2 0 so that the right-hand side of\nequation (24) becomes a non-negative constant. Therefore, any of the con-\ntinuum of singular solutions, y = x\u2212\u03b3s for \u03b3 s a constant in the interval\n\u03b3a \u0001 \u03b3 s \u0001 \u03b3 b , is a valid critical-\u03b1 solution for \u0005 = 2. This is the situation\nthat Hansen (2004) is strictly relevant to, although pure power-law den-\nsity profiles such as these are not applicable to simulations of dark matter\nhaloes.\n4 These solutions are members of the much broader class of \u2018\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2019 models\ndiscussed by Zhao (1996). In Zhao\u2019s notation (which is completely different\nfrom ours), the profiles of equation (37) have (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 ) = (\u03b7\u22121, \u03b3 \u221e, \u03b3 0) =\n(\u03b7\u22121, 3 + \u03b7, 1 \u2212 \u03b7\/2 + \u03b2 0).\nwhich excludes very strong tangential biases. Isotropic models are\nallowed only for \u0005 \u0001 10, a limit which is not relevant to dark matter\nhaloes, but corresponds to the classic Plummer (1911) sphere. On\nthe other hand, the physical requirement \u03b2 0 \u0001 1 implies \u03b3 0 < 2\nand \u03b3 \u221e > 3 for any \u0005 > 2. As a result, all the critical \u03b1 density\nprofiles in equation (37) have a finite total mass, and fully analytical\n\u03c3 2r (r ) and M(r) profiles which are of the same basic form as in\nequations (20).\nTo obtain these profiles in detail, we first express the linear relation\nbetween \u03b2 and \u03b3 in terms of \u03b2\u221e = limr\u2192\u221e\u03b2(r ) instead of b, namely,\n\u03b2(r ) = \u03b20 + \u03b2\u221e \u2212 \u03b20\n\u03b3\u221e \u2212 \u03b30 [\u03b3 (r ) \u2212 \u03b30] .

Thus,\nthe pressure \u03c1\u03c3 2r \u2192 r\u22122\u03b20 , which diverges for radial anisotropies at\nthe centre (\u03b2 0 > 0) but approaches a constant for central isotropy\nand vanishes for tangentially biased central velocity distributions.\nApart from its pleasing \u2013 and somewhat surprising \u2013 simplic-\nity in the face of a non-trivial radial variation of \u03b2(r), the fam-\nily of models defined by equations (40) is further interesting be-\ncause the linear \u2018\u03b2\u2013\u03b3 relation\u2019 in equation (23) or (39) is precisely\nwhat Hansen & Moore (2005) have suggested is a generic result of\ncollisionless collapses, mergers and relaxation processes (see their\nfig. 2).\nMoreover, it is beneficial that for any \u0005 these anisotropic models\nhave the same critical value of the exponent \u03b1 in our \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation\n(5) as do the fully isotropic models, just so long as isotropy holds at\nthe centre alone (\u03b2 0 = 0). Simulated dark matter haloes indeed tend\nto be roughly isotropic at their centres and radially anisotropic in\ntheir outer parts. Thus, as was discussed at the end of Section 2,\nit is again striking that the data shown in the right-hand pan-\nels of Fig. 1 exhibit a scaling \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r \u223c r\u2212\u03b1 with \u03b1 \u0007 1.92 very\nclose to the expected critical value (35\/18 = 1.94) for \u0005 = 3 and\n\u03b2 0 = 0.\nWith these points in mind, we now go on to a detailed fit-\nting of our models in equations (40) to the density and velocity-\ndispersion profiles of dark matter haloes simulated by Diemand et al.\n(2004a,b).\n4 C O M PA R I S O N W I T H S I M U L AT E D H A L O E S\nIn order to compare the anisotropic models in equation (40) against\nthe numerical dark matter haloes, we again make use of the simula-\ntions published by Diemand et al. (2004a,b), which we referred to in\nSection 1 (Fig. 1). To repeat, these include four galaxy-sized haloes\n[virial masses (1\u20132) \u00d7 1012 M\t] and six clusters (virial masses\n2.4 \u00d7 1014\u20131.3 \u00d7 1015 M\t). All were evolved to redshift z = 0\nexcept for two clusters which were run further ahead in time to\ncomplete mergers; see Diemand et al. (2004a,b) for full details.\nIn addition to density profiles, the data on these haloes include\nthe enclosed mass profiles M(r) and the radial and tangential com-\nponents of velocity dispersion, \u03c3 2r (r ) and \u03c3 2t (r ) = \u03c3 2\u03b8 (r ) + \u03c3 2\u03c6(r ).\nFrom the run of \u03c1(r) in a series of spherical shells {ri}, we have\nestimated the local density gradient as \u03b3 (ri) = \u2212[log \u03c1(r i+1) \u2212\nlog \u03c1(r i\u22121)]\/[log r i+1 \u2212 log r i\u22121]. From the velocity dispersions,\nwe have calculated \u03b2(ri) = 1 \u2212 \u03c3 2t (ri)\/2\u03c3 2r (ri) and the total one-\ndimensional dispersion, \u03c3 2tot(ri ) = 1\/3[\u03c3 2r (ri ) + \u03c3 2t (ri )].\nFive parameters define the models in equations (40): the normal-\nization constant M tot and the scale radius r0; the parameters \u0005 and\n\u03b2 0, which fix \u03b7, \u03b3 0 and \u03b3 \u221e (and thus the shapes of all profiles);\nand finally, \u03b2\u221e, the velocity anisotropy at r \u2192 \u221e. Together, these\nmust suffice to describe the separate \u03c1(r ), \u03c3 2r (r ) and \u03b2(r) profiles\nfor a dark matter halo. While it is of course possible to fit each of\nthe 10 simulated haloes individually, we are more interested here\nin the question of whether some \u2018universal\u2019 parameter values might\napply.\nThus, we start by assuming that all haloes follow the same\n\u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation, \u03c1\/\u03c3 \u0005r \u221d r\u2212\u03b1crit , with a single value of \u0005. That this\nis likely so is already suggested by Fig. 1. We further assume that\nthe central velocity anisotropy \u03b2 0 is the same for all haloes. This\nis more of a debatable contention \u2013 even though most simulations\nshow similar (low) levels of anisotropy in their innermost resolved\nregions, there is no clear evidence that \u03b2 0 always tends to a sin-\ngle value. Nevertheless, if \u0005 and \u03b2 0 are both \u2018universal\u2019 then so\nmust be the shape of the density profile in these models, and so this\npossibility is worth examining.\nWe proceed by defining a grid of (\u0005, \u03b2 0) values. For each pair\nin turn, we compute \u03b7, \u03b3 0 and \u03b3 \u221e from equations (36), which\nallows for the calculation of dimensionless model profiles \u03c1mod(r )\nand \u03c3 2r,mod(r ). For each of the 10 haloes, we then find values for\nM ( j)tot , r\n( j)\n0 and \u03b2 ( j)\u221e to minimize the sum of absolute deviations,\n\u000e j (\u0005, \u03b20) =\nN j\u2211\ni=1\n{\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223log \u03c1mod(ri )\u03c1(ri )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223+ \u0005\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223log \u03c3r ,mod(ri )\u03c3r (ri )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n}\n, (41)\nwhich is more robust against outliers than the standard \u03c7 2 statis-\ntic. Here Nj is the number of data points in the jth halo; typically,\nNj = 21. The total deviation that is minimized for each (\u0005, \u03b2 0) is\nthus\n\u000etot(\u0005, \u03b20) =\nNhalo\u2211\nj=1\n\u000e j (\u0005, \u03b20). (42)\nUltimately, we find the set {\u0005, \u03b2 0; M ( j)tot , r ( j)0 , \u03b2 ( j)\u221e , j = 1, . . . , 10} for\nwhich \u000etot is the minimum over our original grid. Strictly speak-\ning, this occurs at \u0005 = 3.2 and \u03b2 0 = \u22120.05, but the minimum is\nrather shallow and the best fit with \u0005 = 3 exactly (which requires\n\u03b2 0 = \u22120.10) is not significantly worse. The details of this latter fit\nare shown in Fig. 3.\nThe upper panels of Fig. 3 show the density and (radial) velocity-\ndispersion data that were used to constrain the model parameters.\nTo emphasize the shapes of the distributions, the radial coordinate\nin each halo j has been normalized by the fitted value of r ( j)0 , and the\ndensities and velocity dispersions have been normalized by their\nfitted values at r ( j)0 . The best-fitting dimensionless profiles, from\nequations (40b) and (40e), are drawn as the bold curves. The rms\nrelative deviations from these curves, (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1mod)\/\u03c1 and (\u03c3 2r \u2212\n\u03c3 2r,mod)\/\u03c3 2r , are both of the order of 11\u201312 per cent for all 10 haloes\ncombined.\nThe left-middle panel of Fig. 3 shows the negative logarithmic\ndensity gradient \u03b3 (r) as a function of r\/r ( j)0 in the simulated haloes\nagainst the model curve given by equation (40c) for \u0005 = 3 and\n\u03b2 0 = \u22120.10. Given these parameters, equations (36) imply that\nthe power-law slopes at r \u2192 0 and r \u2192 \u221e are \u03b3 0 = 2\/3 and\n\u03b3\u221e = 52\/15 = 3.46, respectively. The transition from the inner\nto the outer power law is rather gradual, with \u03b7 = 7\/15 = 0.46.\nRecall that r0 is defined as the radius at which \u03b3 (r 0) = \u03b31, with\n\u03b31 = 1\/2(\u03b30 + \u03b3\u221e) = 31\/15 in this case.\nThe right-middle panel then shows the \u2018observed\u2019 anisotropy pa-\nrameter \u03b2(r) versus the scaled radius x = r\/r ( j)0 . The bold curve\ntraces the model relation (40d) for \u03b2 0 = \u22120.10 and \u03b2\u221e = 0.67,\nwhich is the average of the 10 different \u03b2 ( j)\u221e values obtained by fit-\nting the \u03c3 2r profile of each halo separately. The dashed curves have\nthe same \u03b2 0 = \u22120.10 but \u03b2\u221e = 0.53 and \u03b2\u221e = 0.84, correspond-\ning to the minimum and maximum of the fits to the 10 haloes.\nEvidently, these curves together account for much of the ob-\nserved scatter in \u03b2(r). Note that the average \u03b2\u221e value implies\na slope for the \u03b2\u2013\u03b3 relation (39) of (\u03b2\u221e \u2212 \u03b2 0)\/(\u03b3 \u221e \u2212 \u03b3 0) \u0007\n0.28. This is comparable to the slope d\u03b2\/d\u03b3 \u2248 0.19 inferred\nby Hansen & Moore (2005) from their investigations of a com-\npletely different set of simulated haloes. However, it should also be\nnoted that Hansen & Moore (2005) found a relatively tight corre-\nlation between \u03b2 and \u03b3 (see their fig. 2). Comparison of the data\npoints in the two middle panels of our Fig. 3 shows somewhat more\nscatter in any empirical \u03b2\u2013\u03b3 relation for the haloes we are working\nwith. This is particularly evident at relatively large radii, r\/r 0 \u0003 2.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 363, 1057\u20131068\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nDynamical insight into dark matter haloes 1065\nFigure 3. Comparison of our analytical, \u2018critical-\u03b1\u2019 models in equation (40) with the same 10 simulated CDM haloes from Diemand et al. (2004a,b) which\nhave already been employed in Fig. 1. The exponent \u0005 in the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation (5) was kept fixed at \u0005 = 3, while a global \u03b2 0 was fitted to the density and\nvelocity-dispersion profiles of all haloes simultaneously. For each halo, individual values for the scale radius r0, normalization constant M tot, and an asymptotic\nanisotropy \u03b2\u221e at r \u2192 \u221e have been fitted (see text for more details). The solid curves show the dimensionless model profiles given the global \u0005 and \u03b2 0. Squares\nrepresent the data from the simulated haloes, with the various profiles for each halo scaled by their best-fitting values at the fitted r0 for that particular halo. For\nthe anisotropy profile, the solid curve represents a mean model, in the sense of a mean value for \u03b2\u221e, while the dashed curves indicate the range of best-fitting\nvalues for \u03b2\u221e.\nIn fact, it is not clear that a \u2018universal\u2019 slope in a linear \u03b2\u2013\u03b3 rela-\ntionship (i.e. a unique value of \u03b2\u221e) can describe all of these data if\nthe density profile is strictly \u2018universal\u2019 (i.e. if there truly is a single\nvalue for \u03b2 0 as well as \u0005).\nThe bottom two panels of Fig. 3 complete the compari-\nson with our models. The left-hand panel shows the renor-\nmalized circular-velocity profile,\n\u221a\nM(r )r0\/M(r0)r versus r\/r 0,\nwhich is essentially equivalent to the top left-hand panel show-\ning the model and observed density profiles. The right-hand\npanel shows the normalized total one-dimensional velocity-\ndispersion profile, which is obtained from the two panels above it:\n\u03c3 2tot(r ) = \u03c3 2r (r )[1 \u2212 2\u03b2(r )\/3]. Note that the scatter of \u03c3 2tot about\nour model is some 25 per cent smaller than that of \u03c3 2r : the scat-\nter away from the model curve in the upper right-hand panel\nis compensated by the scatter of \u03b2(r) in the middle right-hand\npanel.\nOverall, it is surprising how well our simple model is able to repro-\nduce the main features of the spatial structure and the kinematics\nof these simulated dark matter haloes. However, it remains to be\nchecked that the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation in the simulated haloes is consistent\nwith that required by the analytical models we have fitted. Specifi-\ncally, by using equations (40) we have assumed that the value of \u03b1\nis the critical one given by equation (31). For \u0005 = 3 and \u03b2 0 = \u22120.10\nas in Fig. 3, this is \u03b1crit = 59\/30 = 1.96. Fig. 4 plots the \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r data\npoints from the 10 Diemand et al. (2004a,b) haloes (normalized by\nour fitted values of \u03c1( j)0 and \u03c3\n( j)\nr,0 for each halo individually) against\nthe scaled radius r\/r ( j)0 . The dashed line has slope \u2212\u03b1crit and gives\na reasonable description of the data. In fact, direct linear regression\n(with a 3\u03c3 clipping applied) yields a best-fitting slope of \u22121.933,\nonly \u00071.5 per cent different from the expected value.5 This is drawn\nas the solid line in Fig. 4. The relative residuals from the critical-\u03b1\nmodel line, [(\u03c1\/\u03c3 3r ) \u2212 (\u03c1\/\u03c3 3r )mod]\/(\u03c1\/\u03c3 3r ), are shown in the lower\npanel. Evidently, the largest deviations from this power law occur\nat r\/r 0 \u0003 2, which is where the \u03c3 2r (r ) and \u03b2(r) profiles scatter most\nin Fig. 3.\n5 The fitted slope here differs slightly from that in the right-hand panel of\nFig. 1 because now we have scaled to the fitted radius r ( j)0 in each halo, rather\nthan to model-independent, but cruder, estimates of r2.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 363, 1057\u20131068\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1066 W. Dehnen and D. E. McLaughlin\nFigure 4. Top panel: plot of \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r against radius for the 10 simulated CDM\nhaloes already employed in Figs 1 and 3. In fact, this plot is very similar\nto the right-hand panel of Fig. 1, the only distinction being that we use our\nbest-fitting values for individual scale radii r ( j)0 to normalize the data in each\nhalo. The solid line gives the best-fitting power-law relation, with exponent\n\u03b1fit = 1.933. The dashed line is the power law implied by the fit of our\ncritical \u03b1 model to the haloes\u2019 density and velocity-dispersion profiles in\nFig. 3: with \u0005 = 3 and \u03b20 = \u22120.10, \u03b1crit = 1.96. Bottom panel: relative\nresiduals of (\u03c1\/\u03c3 3r ) about the latter, critical-\u03b1 power law assumed by our\nmodel fit.\nAs a last test, we wish to compare our model against the es-\ntimated density profile only of an extremely high-resolution halo\nsimulated by Diemand et al. (2005). This is again a cluster-sized\nhalo. As Diemand et al. (2005) describe in detail, this particular\nhalo was defined by first performing a simulation with spatial res-\nolution of 10\u22123 in units of the virial radius, evolving the run to a\nhigh redshift. The most central part of the density profile was then\nscaled to match on to the outer parts of a lower resolution halo previ-\nously evolved to z = 0. Because of this estimation procedure, we do\nnot have the full velocity-dispersion and anisotropy profiles for this\ncluster.\nEven in the absence of kinematical data, we can fit for all of \u0005, \u03b2 0,\nM tot and r0 using the density profile alone. In practice, we set \u0005 = 3\nand only fit for \u03b2 0 and the two normalization factors by minimizing\nthe sum of absolute deviations \u000e = \u2211i |log \u03c1mod(ri ) \u2212 log \u03c1(ri )|.\nIn this case, the shape of the density profile at small r requires\na slightly larger \u03b2 0 than we found for Fig. 3: \u03b2 0 \u0007 0.03 (which,\nreasonably, is still nearly isotropic). This is one indication that\ndark matter halo density profiles may not be exactly universal af-\nter all, even if the value of \u0005 is. Some of the scatter found in \u03b3 at\nthe resolution limit of numerous simulations (e.g. Diemand et al.\n2004b; Fukushige et al. 2004; Navarro et al. 2004) may in fact be\nreal and, in our model at least, connected to non-universal halo\nkinematics.\nThe top panel of Fig. 5 plots the best fit of equation (40b) against\nthe data for this one halo, now with the virial radius r vir taken as\nthe normalization point; this model is given by the solid curve. For\ncomparison with other fitting functions employed in the literature,\nwe have also found the best-fitting NFW profile,\n\u03c1(r )\/\u03c12 = 4 (r\/r2)\u22121(1 + r\/r2)\u22122 , (43)\nFigure 5. Comparison of the best fit (solid curves) of equation (40b) to the\nhigh-resolution \u2018billion-particle\u2019 halo of Diemand et al. (2005). For this fit,\n\u0005 = 3 was fixed a priori and only \u03b2 0, r 0 and M tot were allowed to vary.\nThe vertical dot\u2013dashed line indicates the resolution limit of the simulation,\naccording to Diemand et al. The dotted, dot\u2013dashed and long-dashed curves\ncorrespond to the best fits of the profiles proposed by Navarro et al. (1996)\n[see equation (43)], Navarro et al. (2004) (see equation 44) and Diemand\net al. (2005) (see equation 45), respectively.\nwhich we show as the dotted curve. The best-fitting function of the\ntype suggested by Navarro et al.

Here \u03b1 N is a free parameter in\nthe fit, which we find to be \u03b1 N = 0.144. Finally, the fitting formula\npreferred by Diemand et al. (2005),\n\u03c1(r )\/\u03c1s = 21.8 (r\/rs)\u22121.2(1 + r\/rs)\u22121.8, (45)\nis drawn as the long-dashed curve. Within the resolved radial range\nof the simulation, r\/r vir \u0002 10\u22123, there is little obvious difference\nbetween these fits in a plot of \u03c1 versus r.\nIn the middle panel of Fig. 5, we show the fractional residuals\nfrom each of the four models fitted to \u03c1(r). The points joined by the\nsolid curve denote the residuals from the fit of our model; residuals\nfrom the others just listed are in the same line types and colours as\nin the upper panel. The NFW model is clearly worse than any of the\nothers, but the remaining three are competitive. The rms fractional\ndensity residual about the best NFW fit is 16 per cent; that about\nthe Navarro et al. (2004) function is 6.3 per cent; that about the\nDiemand et al. (2005) formula is 5.2 per cent; and that about our\nmodel with \u0005 = 3 and \u03b2 0 = 0.03 is 6.0 per cent. The main source\nof the slightly higher global scatter in our model versus the fitting\nfunction of Diemand et al. (2005) is the single density point closest\nto the resolution limit of this simulation.\nIt is noteworthy that our best-fitting dynamical model is almost\nidentical to the best-fitting Navarro et al.

At some level, it is not\nsurprising that either of these curves is an improvement over, say,\nthe NFW profile, since both the former involve three free parameters\nin \u03c1(r) (recall that we fixed \u0005 = 3 in fitting our model to this halo)\nwhile the NFW function contains only two. The advantage to our\nmodel, of course, is that the extra degree of freedom in fitting the\ndensity profile is also used simultaneously to predict the anisotropic\nkinematics of the halo. For example, from equation (31) we would\npredict \u03b1 =\u03b1crit = 1.938 in the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation (5) for this halo. Perhaps\ncoincidentally, this is almost exactly the \u03b1fit found in Fig. 4 for the\n10 lower resolution haloes from Diemand et al. (2004a,b).\nFinally, the bottom panel of Fig. 5 shows the negative logarithmic\ndensity slope estimated as a function of radius directly from the data\nof Diemand et al. (2005), against the behaviours predicted by each\nof the four fits to the density profile. With \u0005 = 3 and \u03b2 0 = 0.03,\nour model has \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 0 = 0.81 as r \u2192 0, and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u221e = 3.44 as\nr \u2192 \u221e. The rollover to \u03b3 0 is very gradual however [from equation\n(36a), \u03b7 = 0.438 here], and at the resolution limit of the simulation\nwe still find \u03b3 \u0007 1 for the fit. Apparently, still higher resolution\nsimulations are required to distinguish clearly between our density\nmodel and others, such as that of Diemand et al. (2005), with dif-\nferent asymptotic slopes in the limit r \u2192 0.\n5 S U M M A RY A N D D I S C U S S I O N\nAs a rule, investigations into the structure of simulated dark matter\nhaloes have focused on the nearly \u2018universal\u2019 shape of their density\nprofiles. This approach is plagued, however, by the fact that the\nhaloes are only ever resolved over 2\u20133 decades in radius. Since the\nlogarithmic density slope clearly varies smoothly over this entire\nrange, in a way that is not anticipated from any first principles, it is\nthen difficult to characterize unambiguously the true form of \u03c1(r)\nwith necessarily ad hoc, empirical fitting functions. In particular,\nthe value of the asymptotic central power-law slope (if a single,\nuniversal asymptote even exists in the limit r \u2192 0) remains ill-\nconstrained. Thus, the starting point of our analysis in this paper\nwas the remarkable, and much simpler, empirical fact [Taylor &\nNavarro 2001, see also Hansen (2004)] that simulated haloes satisfy,\nover their whole resolved range, a \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation of the general form\n\u03c1(r )\n\u03c3 \u0005r (r )\n\u221d r\u2212\u03b1\nfor \u03c3r the radial component of velocity dispersion, and \u0005 \u0007 3. [As\nit happens, using the total one-dimensional velocity dispersion also\nleads to a nearly power-law \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation, with a slightly different\nvalue for \u03b1; see Taylor & Navarro (2001), and Fig. 1 above.] A single\npower-law dependence such as this is clearly easier to recognize,\nand to quantify accurately, than is a radius-dependent curvature in\nthe density profile. It is also the simplest non-trivial form that any\nhalo relation could take, and hence the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 scaling may be the most\nfundamental aspect of dark matter haloes.\nWe should note here that, while \u03c1\/\u03c3 3 has the dimension of phase-\nspace density, its interpretation as phase-space density (Taylor &\nNavarro 2001; Williams et al. 2004), coarse-grained or not, is prob-\nlematic.6 On the other hand however, if the phase-space density was\n6 Only if the functional form of the distribution of velocities were indepen-\ndent of radius, i.e. the distribution function separable, would \u03c1\/\u03c3 3 equal the\naverage phase-space density at radius r. However, there is no a priori reason\nwhy this situation should be satisfied in dark matter haloes.\nin some sense of power-law form, we might expect \u03c1\/\u03c3 3 to closely,\nbut not exactly, follow a power law, too.\nOur basic assumption has been that a power-law \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation\nholds for all radii, not just those resolved by simulations. It is then\npossible to use this as a constraint on the spherical Jeans equation\nin order to derive the density profile of an equilibrium halo. In Sec-\ntion 2, we did just this, for a specialized case with \u0005 = 3 fixed\nand velocity isotropy assumed. This part of the analysis is thus\nsimilar to the original work of Taylor & Navarro (2001), and to\naspects of Williams et al. (2004) [see also Hansen (2004)]. How-\never, our study has expanded considerably on these others, as we\ninvestigated the full space of all physical solutions to the isotropic\nJeans equation under a power-law \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation with arbitrary ex-\nponent \u03b1. Most importantly, we have found that only one solution\n\u03c1(r) exists, which asymptotes to realistic power-law behaviour in\nthe limits of both small and large radii. This solution occurs only\nfor a single critical value of \u03b1 and, for this one solution only, the\ndensity, velocity-dispersion and enclosed-mass profiles are all fully\nanalytic.\nIn Section 3, we extended our analysis by allowing for arbitrary\nexponents \u0005 in the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation and, unlike any other detailed study\nbefore, for velocity anisotropy. We found that the problem remains\nanalytically tractable for any \u0005 > 2, only if we adopt a \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation\ninvolving the radial component \u03c3r of velocity dispersion rather than\nthe total (empirically both are equally well motivated, see Fig. 1) and\nif we assume the anisotropy parameter \u03b2(r ) \u2261 1 \u2212\u03c3 2\u03b8 \/\u03c3 2r to be either\nspatially constant or linearly dependent on the logarithmic density\nslope \u03b3 (r ) \u2261 \u2212(d ln\u03c1\/d lnr ). Under these reasonable assumptions,\nthere always exists an exact analogue to the fully analytical density\nprofile we found in the isotropic, \u0005 = 3 case. This solution again\noccurs for a particular, \u2018critical\u2019 \u03b1 value. Moreover, for the realistic\ncase of \u03b2 linearly increasing with \u03b3 (corresponding to outward ever\nmore radially biased anisotropy), this is the only physical solution\nwhich resembles simulated dark matter haloes.\nThis result is gratifying for two reasons. First, it connects neatly\nwith an entirely independent, empirical finding by Hansen & Moore\n(2005), who have argued on the basis of a variety of simulations that\nindeed there exists a roughly linear relation between \u03b2(r) and \u03b3 (r) in\ncollisionless haloes formed through numerous different processes.\nSecondly, it turns out that the slope of this linear \u2018\u03b2\u2013\u03b3 relation\u2019 does\nnot affect the critical value of \u03b1, nor does it affect the shape of the\nequilibrium \u03c1(r) profile itself. Rather, both of these things are influ-\nenced only by the central anisotropy \u03b2 0 \u2261 \u03b2(r = 0). Specifically,\nfor a \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation with \u0005 = 3 (which ultimately does appear to be\nmost appropriate), our solution of the Jeans equation with radially\nvarying velocity anisotropy requires\n\u03c1\n\u03c3 3r\n\u221d r\u2212 3518 + 29 \u03b20 (46a)\nand has density\n\u03c1(r ) \u221d x\u2212 7+10\u03b209\n[\n1 + x 2 (2\u2212\u03b20)9\n]\u22126\n, (46b)\nwith x \u2261 r\/r 0, radial velocity dispersion\n\u03c3 2r (r ) \u221d x\n7\u22128\u03b20\n9\n[\n1 + x 2 (2\u2212\u03b20)9\n]\u22124\n, (46c)\nand anisotropy\n\u03b2(r ) \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03c3\n2\n\u03b8 (r )\n\u03c3 2r (r )\n= \u03b20 + \u03b2\u221ex\n2(2\u2212\u03b20)\/9\n1 + x2(2\u2212\u03b20)\/9 (46d)\nfor any \u03b2 0 \u0001 1, \u03b2\u221e \u0001 1. Thus, the halo density profile has a shallow\npower-law cusp, \u03c1 \u2192 r\u2212(7+10\u03b20)\/9 in the limit r \u2192 0, and steepens\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 363, 1057\u20131068\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1068 W.

More\ngeneral results for \u0005 \f= 3 in the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation, including analytical\nexpressions for the velocity-dispersion, enclosed-mass and circular-\nvelocity profiles are given in equations (40) above [with auxiliary\ndefinitions in equation (36)].\nIn Section 4, we fit our analytical, critical-\u03b1 density and velocity-\ndispersion profiles to those in 10 dark-matter haloes simulated by\nDiemand et al. (2004a,b). When modelling these \u2018data\u2019, we assumed\nthat all haloes obey a \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation with a single value of \u0005 and have\nthe same central velocity anisotropy \u03b2 0, so that the halo density\nprofile is necessarily universal. We were able to find a good fit\nto all 10 haloes simultaneously for \u0005 = 3 and \u03b2 0 = \u22120.10, only\nslightly different from isotropic; see Fig. 3. For this combination of\nparameters, our model requires \u03c1\/\u03c3 3r \u221d r\u22121.96 for self-consistency,\nand we showed in Fig. 4 that this is a satisfactory description of the\ndata.\nIn Section 4, we also fit our model to the density profile of\nan extremely high-resolution \u2018billion-particle\u2019 halo simulated by\nDiemand et al. (2005), finding good agreement again with \u0005 = 3\nand a nearly isotropic \u03b2 0 = 0.03. In this case, the fitted density\nprofile has a central power-law cusp \u03c1 \u2192 r\u22120.81 as r \u2192 0, which\nsteepens gradually to \u03c1 \u2192 r\u22123.44 as r \u2192 \u221e (see Fig. 5). At the\nresolution limit of the Diemand et al. simulation (about 0.001 of the\nvirial radius), the fit has \u03b3 \u0007 1, significantly larger than the asymp-\ntotic cusp slope and still consistent with both the simulation data and\nthe behaviour of other fitting functions. Within the resolved radial\nrange, our model fit is also very closely traced by the best fit of the\nad hoc profile proposed by Navarro et al. (2004).\nOur findings suggest a possible first-principles explanation for\nhalo density profiles along the following line of arguments. The\ninitial distribution function before collapse was completely cold\n(a \u03b4-function in velocity space) and hence the phase-space density\nscale-free. The collapse and the subsequent process of violent relax-\nation (phase-space mixing) is driven by gravity alone, which cannot\nintroduce any scale dependence. This implies that the phase-space\ndensity of the collapsed halo satisfies some form of scale invari-\nance, suggesting that the ratio \u03c1(r )\/\u03c3 3, which is closely related to\nthe phase-space density, follows a power law (the general scale-\ninvariant functional form). However, as our analysis has shown,\nif \u03c1(r )\/\u03c3 3 of dark matter haloes is any power of radius, then the\ncondition of equilibrium (and physically sensible density profiles)\nrequires the particular power law r\u2212\u03b1crit and, simultaneously, that\nthe density profile follows that given above.\nFrom our fits to simulated haloes in Section 4, the \u03b2\u2013\u03b3 relation\nseems not as tight or universal as the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation. This is not\nvery surprising, since different amounts of velocity anisotropy are\nrequired to stabilize different spatial halo shapes, resulting in some\nscatter between the \u03b2\u2013\u03b3 relations of different haloes. Since only the\ncentral-velocity anisotropy \u03b2 0 affects the value of \u03b1crit, this scatter\nhas little (or no) influence on the the \u03c1\u2013\u03c3 relation as long as \u03b2 0 is\nsimilar (or the same) for different haloes. This explains why haloes\nof different spatial shapes still have very similar density profiles.\nWhether \u03b2 0 is a universal parameter (close to zero) or whether there\nis some real scatter we cannot predict, but in Section 4 we obtained\na good fit to 10 different simulated haloes using a single value for\n\u03b2 0 (see Fig. 3).\nOf course, our analysis is still restricted to spherical symmetry\nand ignores any halo substructure. However, substructure is unim-\nportant for the issue of the overall density profile, as simulations of\ndark matter structure formation with suppressed small-scale power\nin the initial conditions still yield the same characteristic density\nprofiles, but much less substructure (Moore et al. 1999). The issue\nof asphericity is more likely to be relevant and hence it is all the\nmore remarkable that our spherical analysis gives such a good de-\nscription of the spherically averaged profiles. Evidently, anisotropy,\nwhich was ignored in previous studies, is more important than as-\nphericity, presumably because the gravitational potential is always\nless aspherical than the density distribution.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nIt is a pleasure to thank Ju\u00a8rg Diemand for kindly and promptly\nproviding us, in electronic form, with the density and kinematic\nradial profiles for simulated CDM haloes.
