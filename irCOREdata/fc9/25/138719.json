Ideally, subsoil vulnerability to15\ncompaction should be assessed by direct measurement of soil bearing capacity but16\ncurrently no direct practical tests are available.

This paper, therefore, proposes a19\nsimple classification system for subsoil vulnerability to compaction based for field use20\non local soil and wetness data at the time of critical trafficking, and, at European level,21\non related soil and climatic information. Soil data are readily available \u2018in Country\u2019 or22\nfrom the European Soil Database and climatic data are stored in the agrometeorological23\ndatabase of the MARS Project. The vulnerability to compaction is assessed using a24\ntwo-stage process. First, the inherent susceptibility of the soil to compaction is25\nestimated on the basis of the relatively stable soil properties of texture and packing26\ndensity. Second, the susceptibility class is then converted into a vulnerability class27\nthrough consideration of the likely soil moisture status at the time of critical loadings.28\nFor use at local level, adjustments are suggested to take account of possible differences29\nin the support strength of the topsoil and specific subsoil structural conditions. The30\nvulnerability classes proposed are based on profile pit observations, on a wide range of31\nsoils examined mainly in intensively farmed areas where large-scale field equipment is32\nemployed. A map of soil susceptibility to compaction in Europe has been produced, as33\nthe first stage in developing a more rigorous quantitative approach to assessing overall34\nvulnerability than has been possible hitherto.35\n36\nKey words: subsoil; compaction; soil classification; Europe37\n38\n39\n1. Introduction40\n41\nIn the context of this paper, \u2018subsoil is defined as subsurface soil material that lies42\nbelow the normal annual cultivation depth or pedological A horizon as appropriate\u2019.43\nKnowledge concerning the vulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction is an44\nincreasing requirement within agriculture and in the planning of environmental45\nprotection measures. Once subsoil damage occurs, it can be extremely difficult and46\nexpensive to alleviate. Subsoil compaction risks are increasing with growth in farm47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n2\nsize, increased mechanisation and equipment size, and the drive for greater1\nproductivity. The response of the engineering industry to the demands of agriculture2\nhas been impressive over the past 30 years. Larger and larger machines have been3\ndeveloped but, from the soil standpoint, the result has been a significant increase in4\naxle loads not always matched by reductions in ground contact pressures to prevent or5\nminimise compaction. (Renius, 1994; Tijink et al., 1995).6\n7\nResearch into the causes and effects of compaction in topsoils and subsoils in Europe8\nhas demonstrated the detrimental effects on the farming system (Hakansson, 1994). It9\nis now clear, however, that the detrimental effects of compaction go far beyond10\nagricultural concerns of restricted root penetration, decreasing yields and increasing11\nmanagement costs. The overall deterioration in soil structure that may result from12\ncompaction, aggravated at times by a build up of water above the compacted layer, can13\nalso:14\n1. increase lateral seepage of excess water over and through the soil, accelerating the15\npotential pollution of surface waters by organic wastes (slurry and sludge),16\npesticides, herbicides and other applied agrochemicals;17\n2. decrease the volume of the soil system available to act as a buffer and a filter for18\npollutants;19\n3. increase the risk of soil erosion and associated phosphorus losses on sloping land20\nthrough the concentration of excess water above compacted layers;21\n4. accelerate effective runoff from and within catchments.22\n5. increase green house gas production and nitrogen losses through denitrification23\nunder wetter conditions.24\n25\nRecently, the Regions in Europe have been charged with the task of developing26\nenvironmental protection plans and an integral component of these will be soil27\nprotection. Compaction, particularly in subsoils, has, therefore, ceased to be a problem28\nonly of productive agriculture; the environmental impacts that can ensue are now29\ncausing serious concern (Van den Akker, 1999). Assessing the vulnerability of30\ndifferent subsoils to compaction is, therefore, an increasingly important issue. This is31\nnot only so that appropriate measures can be identified for its avoidance in different32\nsituations, but also to determine the extent of actual and potential problems within33\nEurope.34\n35\nWhilst the ideal method for assessing the vulnerability of a subsoil to compaction36\nwould be to make direct measurements of its support or bearing capacity, no reliable,37\neasily applicable direct tests are available to achieve this. Assessments have to be made38\nindirectly from more readily measured parameters and soil properties. From a research39\nviewpoint, attention to the soil mechanical strength properties, stress\/strain40\nrelationships and the pattern of structural recovery after compaction is appropriate. The41\nassessment of these properties is, however, particularly involved and to date there is42\ninsufficient information available to allow results to be extrapolated widely beyond the43\nresearch locations themselves (Bullock et al., 1985). Until such information becomes44\navailable, guidance on soil vulnerability to compaction must be based on more readily45\nmeasurable and available information, supplemented by field experience of soil46\nbehaviour under load.47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n3\n1\nThe most readily available spatial information on soils in most countries is soil survey2\ndata and this can be supplemented with climatic and land use\/cover data. A simple3\nscheme, using existing soil and climatic data for assessing the vulnerability of subsoils4\nto compaction in different climatic situations, is described here. Adjustments are also5\nproposed for application of the scheme in local areas but it should be emphasised that6\nany such scheme can only provide general guidance for use on a local or national scale.7\nModification for local situations must take account of particular local characteristics8\nthat could alter any vulnerability class.9\n10\nAt European level, spatial soil data are held within the European Soil Database11\n(Heineke et al., 1998) and climatic data in the agrometeorological database of the12\nMARS Project (Vossen and Meyer-Roux, 1995). Both these databases are located at13\nthe European Union's Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy. The objective of this paper14\nis to demonstrate the use of these databases for the construction of maps, albeit at small15\nscale, showing areas most vulnerable to subsoil compaction. Such maps should be of16\nimmediate value to policy makers. Whilst the European soil and climatic databases17\nhave their limitations, they offer a useful starting point. If supplemented with further18\ninformation at local level, vulnerability assessments could assist in the planning of19\nfield operations. Such information is essential for any review of land use systems and20\nthis paper aims to take the first significant step towards providing the necessary21\nframework.22\n23\n24\n2. Soil resistance to deformation and compaction25\n26\nThe degree of soil movement and possible compaction consequences, that occur when27\na soil is subjected to external loads, depend upon the magnitudes of the loads, the28\npressures applied and the soil sliding or shearing resistance developed during29\ndeformation. (Spoor, 1979). Soil shearing resistance comprises largely of two30\ncomponents whose magnitudes vary between soils and soil conditions. The two31\ncomponents are the frictional and cohesive resistances.32\n33\nThe magnitude of the frictional resistance component is dependent on soil particle type34\nand size distribution, the shape, size and stability of structural units present, and the35\nnature and tightness of their packing (Terzarghi and Peck, 1962). Angular shaped36\nparticles and units tend to offer a greater resistance to sliding than rounded particles37\nand the greater the degree of interlocking the greater the resistance.38\n39\nThe cohesive component is very dependent upon soil moisture status and the surface40\nactivity of the clay fraction (Spoor and Godwin 1979). Cohesion increases at higher41\nmoisture tensions, particularly in the active surface area of the soil particles and units.42\nChemical and organic bonding forces can be a significant component of cohesion in43\nsome soils and these can be influenced by cation type and soil pH. In rapid loading44\nsituations, in saturated soils or in cases with similar loadings on saturated45\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n4\nstructural\/shrinkage units, viscosity effects can also influence deformation resistance1\n(Spoor, 2000).2\n3\nTraffic loadings on subsoils tend to be largely vertical. Air filled horizontal pores and4\nplanar voids are much more susceptible to closure than their vertical counterparts and5\nthis decreases horizontal permeability. Therefore, soil structural type and fissure\/crack-6\ndevelopment are important factors controlling the degree of compaction that may7\noccur. The greater the number of vertical macropores for similar soil unit stability and8\nstrength, the greater the resistance to compaction. Vertical biopores formed by roots9\nand soil organisms are also extremely resistant to collapse under the action of vertical10\ncompressive loads; they do, however, easily succumb to significant horizontal shearing11\nloads. The exception to the normal largely vertical loadings arises through the12\noperation of tractor wheels within the open furrow during ploughing operations. Large13\nhorizontal as well as vertical stresses can also be induced through wheel slip in such14\nsituations.15\n16\nIn most field situations, subsoils that have been previously stressed over time have17\nresponded, through compaction, consolidation and partial recovery, to the stresses18\napplied. The largest of these stresses has frequently originated from numerous in-19\nfurrow wheelings during ploughing operations. In some situations, particularly on20\ncoarse and medium textured soils, more compact zones may be present below21\nploughing depth. Although these more compact zones are frequently referred to as22\n\u2018pans\u2019, with the assumption that they act effectively as barriers to root penetration and23\ndownward percolation of water, this is by no means necessarily the case. These24\nchanges and conditions will influence the stress distribution in the subsoil during25\nloading and the aim of subsoil protection measures in current loading situations must26\nbe to ensure that, in the absence of unacceptable vertical impedance, new subsoil27\nstresses do not exceed these pre-consolidation\/compaction stresses.28\n29\nDuring surface loading, topsoil condition in terms of its looseness\/firmness\/strength30\nwill also influence the stresses transmitted to the subsoil. In weak topsoils,31\nconsiderable wheel or track sinkage can also occur increasing the magnitude of the32\nstresses within the subsoil.33\n34\n35\n3. Methods36\nA two-stage methodology is proposed to assess the vulnerability of subsoil to37\ncompaction:38\n39\n1. Assessing the inherent susceptibility on the basis of the relatively stable soil40\nproperties of texture and packing density.41\n2. Combining this soil susceptibility with an index of climatic dryness\/subsoil42\nwetness, or actual moisture status, to determine the vulnerability class.43\n44\nA highly susceptibility soil is one that has properties that make it likely to become45\ncompact, given the appropriate compactive forces and the right moisture status.46\n47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n5\nKnowledge of soil physical properties and moisture status can be particularly helpful in1\nassessing the likely magnitude of the soil shearing resistance and hence the inherent2\nsusceptibility and vulnerability of a subsoil to compaction. Those properties most3\nclosely related are as follows:4\n1. Soil texture, estimated from the proportion of sand, silt and clay (% by weight), and5\nexpressed as a texture class.6\n2. Nature of clay fraction and associated ions7\n3. Bulk density, t m-3 (g cm-3)8\n4. Organic matter content, often expressed as percentage organic carbon (by weight)9\n5. Structure, the type, size and degree of ped development which strongly influence10\nporosity, permeability and nature of macro-pores11\n6. Soil moisture (water) content (% vol.).12\n7. Soil moisture potential (kPa).13\n14\nWith the exception of information on clay mineral type and soil moisture15\ncontent\/potential, all the other properties are reported in or can be inferred from soil16\nsurvey records and databases. In some situations, clay mineralogy can also be inferred17\nfrom geology or soil parent material or soil structural properties.18\n19\nThe soil moisture content is the most variable of these parameters and, in the case of20\ncompaction, the water content at the time of deformation is critical to the amount and21\nextent of compaction that occurs and its subsequent effect on soil physical conditions.22\nOn a medium timescale, climate and weather govern the moisture status of soils except23\nin highly receiving sites such as marshes, the lowest parts of river valleys and around24\nlakes, including wetlands. The agrometeorological databases can, therefore, provide25\nvaluable information on the overall climatic moisture status for many large-scale26\nsituations. At a local level the moisture status at critical loading times is usually known27\nor can be inferred.28\n29\n3.1 Available soil data for estimating susceptibility to compaction30\n31\nA number of systems are used in different countries for recording soil information, but,32\nin the European Soil Database, all the soils of Europe are classified according to the33\nFAO-UNESCO (1974) system. Linkages are available for conversions between the34\ndifferent systems, including the revised FAO-UNESCO-ISRIC (1990), where required.35\nIn this paper, the FAO-UNESCO (1974, 1990) system is used as the standard so that36\nthe results will be applicable to the whole of Europe.37\n38\n3.1.1 Soil texture39\nThe FAO-UNESCO soil texture classes are shown below in tabular (Table 1) and40\ngraphical form (Figure 1). Ideally in future, a more complex scheme of soil texture41\nclasses would be advantageous for assessing susceptibility to compaction, for example42\nthat of the USDA (Schoeneberger et al., 1998) or the UK (Hodgson, 1997).43\n44\n3.1.2. Density45\nBulk density, measured on undisturbed samples (Hall et al., 1977) for the different soil46\nhorizons (layers) in representative profiles, provides the most useful density47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n6\ninformation for compaction assessment. Unfortunately, data on the density of soils are1\nnot readily available because of the time and expense required for making the2\nnecessary measurements. Consequently, a pedotransfer rule (PTR) for estimating3\nsubsoil density has been developed by Van Ranst et al. (1995), for use where no direct4\nmeasurements are available.5\n6\nThis PTR at European level integrates an estimate of subsoil structure, assessed as7\npoor, medium or good from pedological inputs such as the FAO soil name, to give8\npacking density or Lagerungsdichte (Renger, 1970). Packing density (PD), which9\nelsewhere in the literature is given the symbol Ld, effectively integrates the bulk10\ndensity, structure, organic matter content of mineral fraction and clay content, to11\nprovide a single measure of the apparent compactness of the soil. Elsewhere, it has12\nproved to be a very useful parameter for spatial interpretations that require a measure13\nof the compactive state of soils (Jones and Thomasson, 1993). In situations where the14\nactual bulk density is known, packing density can be readily determined from equation15\n(1).16\n17\nPD = Db + 0.009C \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(1)18\n19\nWhere Db is the bulk density in t m-320\nPD is the packing density in t m-321\nC is the clay content (%, by weight)22\n23\nThree classes of packing density are recognised: low <1.40, medium 1.40 to 1.75 and24\nhigh > 1.75 t m-3.25\n26\nSoils with high packing density (> 1.75 t m-3) are generally not very susceptible to27\nfurther compaction whereas those with medium and low PD (< 1.40 t m-3) are28\nvulnerable at critical moisture contents and loads.29\n30\n3.1.3. Organic matter31\nOrganic matter contents of mineral subsoils are usually very low (< 2%) and hence are32\nunlikely to have a major influence on subsoil compactability. The exceptions are some33\nFluvisols (CEC, 1985; FAO-UNESCO, 1974) that by definition are developed in34\nmaterials recently laid down by river systems, in which organic carbon contents in the35\nsubsoils may exceed 2%. Organic soils and some soils with subsurface horizons rich in36\norganic matter (e.g. Humic Podzols) are further exceptions. The packing densities of37\nfluvial subsoils tend to be lower than in non-fluvial subsoils of corresponding texture38\nbecause fluvial materials are naturally much less compact. Hence density assessments39\nfor these soils could require organic matter correction. In practice, the higher organic40\nmatter content in Fluvisols does not appear to account for the low density in the subsoil41\nso it is not considered necessary to take organic matter into account in any assessment42\nof susceptibility to compaction.43\n44\n3.1.4. Structure45\nInternational systems for assessing soil structure describe the size, shape and strength46\nof peds (Schoeneberger et al., 1998; FAO-ISRIC, 1990; and Hodgson, 1997). Structure47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n7\nis an important aspect of the overall strength of the soil and hence its susceptibility to1\ncompaction. Generally, soils with single grain, granular and weakly developed blocky2\nstructures are susceptible to compaction. Strong blocky, prismatic and platy structured3\nsoils are not particularly susceptible at low moisture contents but generally the4\nsusceptibility of these structures is strongly interactive with moisture content. Another5\ncomplicating factor is that fine and very-fine textured soils with angular blocky and6\nprismatic structures often have high packing densities. In this respect, these soils can7\nbe regarded as naturally compact and, therefore, are not usually susceptible to further8\ncompaction as a result of management. For local application, adjustments to9\nvulnerability class may be necessary to take account of specific soil structure10\nsituations.11\n12\n3.2. Soil\/climate interactions influencing vulnerability to compaction13\n14\nThe previous section describes the soil physical properties important in assessing the15\ninherent susceptibility of a soil to compaction. However, the strength of any soil at a16\nparticular bulk density depends, crucially on its moisture status at the time of loading17\nand deformation (Spoor and Godwin, 1979).18\n19\nTo translate soil susceptibility to compaction into vulnerability, soil moisture contents,20\ntopsoil condition and the magnitudes of likely loadings and pressures at critical times21\nmust be taken into account. Vulnerability, can be considered as a likelihood that22\ncompaction will occur. Considering the moisture component, to establish a scheme or23\nsystem for classifying the vulnerability of soils to compaction, some direct measure of24\nmoisture status or estimate of climatic wetness is needed. A crucial question is: \u2018what25\nis the likely moisture content of soils susceptible to compaction at the time of year26\nwhen field operations such as seed bed preparation, fertilising, slurry spreading and27\nharvesting, are taking place?\u2019 In machinery management terms, compaction risks are28\nfrequently greatest during the harvesting period, when the heaviest equipment is likely29\nto be employed. However in climatic terms, risks may be greater in spring when30\nmoisture contents are higher than in autumn over much of northern Europe (see31\nThomasson, 1982; Thomasson and Jones, 1989).32\n33\nOne measure of the climatic conditions influencing soil moisture-state is to assess the34\nexcess of evapotranspiration over rainfall during the growing season. This can be a35\nuseful index in many situations, particularly with respect to likely moisture conditions36\nduring the harvesting period. In practical terms it is necessary to use the potential37\nevapotranspiration, the resulting parameter being called the potential soil moisture38\ndeficit \u2013 PSMD \u2013 (Smith, 1967; Jones and Thomasson, 1985) as defined in Equation39\n(2).40\n41\nFor the period considered:42\nPSMD = \uf053(R-PE) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(2)43\nWhen PE exceeds R44\nWhere: PSMD is the maximum potential soil moisture deficit45\nR is the rainfall in mm46\nPE is the potential evapotranspiration in mm.47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n8\n1\nThe PSMD, expressed in mm rainfall equivalent is a measure of the overall maximum2\ndryness of a rainfed system. It is essentially a climatic index independent of soil or3\nclimatic variations.4\n5\nThe actual soil moisture deficit is not dependent on weather conditions alone but is6\nalso affected by soil water reserves, the crop ground cover, the proximity of a ground7\nwater table to the surface and land management practices such as drainage and8\nirrigation. Relatively high water tables during the growing season with associated9\ncapillary rise can significantly reduce the soil moisture deficit when compared with the10\npotential value, as can irrigation.11\n12\nEstimates of the actual soil moisture deficit for specific locations can be obtained by13\nadjusting the potential evapotranspiration for crop type. Jones and Thomasson (1985)14\npropose a method for correcting PSMD for the main arable crops in temperate areas:15\nwinter wheat, spring barley, sugar beet and potatoes, and grass. The Crop Growth16\nMonitoring System (CGMS) developed at the Joint Research Centre in the MARS17\nProject (Vossen and Meyer-Roux, 1995) uses a less data demanding methodology18\nbased on crop calenders to address the same problem.19\n20\nThere are other parameters suitable for indicating soil moisture conditions. These21\ninclude the beginning and the end of field capacity (FC), its duration in days (Jones,22\n1985; Jones and Thomasson, 1985), the timing of likely rainfall following long dry23\nperiods and practical experience of water table measurements that indicate subsoil24\nwetness at critical trafficking periods. In irrigated areas, information on likely moisture25\ndeficits at specific periods during the year is usually available from irrigation26\nscheduling data. In places where the early spring period is the most critical for tillage27\nor landwork, subsoil moisture contents during that period are usually at or very close to28\nfield capacity and hence moisture deficits can be assumed to be zero or very low. This29\nof course may not be the case in southern Europe.30\n31\nBecause of the site-specific nature of the more refined moisture status indices, the32\npotential soil moisture deficit is used in this analysis as the moisture state index.33\nPSMD has proved a particularly useful climatic parameter in the wetter north of the34\nEuropean Continent (Jones and Thomasson, 1993), but its application needs to be35\ntested further in the drier climates of the south, before its adoption for the whole of36\nEurope is justified.37\n38\n39\n4. Susceptibility and vulnerability classification40\n41\nThere is a general lack of quantitative data on the compactability of different types of42\nsubsoil. Classes of susceptibility and vulnerability of subsoils to compaction have43\ntherefore been drawn up on the basis of soil advisors\u2019 long-term experiences in the44\nfield together with data derived from profile pit observations on a wide range of soils,45\noccurring mainly in intensively farmed areas where large-scale equipment is employed.46\n47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n9\n4.1. Susceptibility classification1\n2\nTable 2 classifies the inherent susceptibility of subsoils to compaction on the basis of3\ntexture and packing density. The classification does not include a soil structure item4\ndirectly, because in practice subsoil structure and its stability are often closely related5\nto texture and packing density Where deviation from this occurs, due allowance will6\nneed to be made directly for the influence of structure. In the classification system7\nproposed, it is considered that any structure within the texture code classes 1,2,3 and 98\nis very weak in terms of its potential resistance to subsoil compaction. Strong and9\ncoarse structural units are frequently found in the fine and very fine texture classes10\nplaying an important role in resistance to compaction and this is taken into account in11\nthe susceptibility classes suggested.12\n13\nThe susceptibility classification (Table 2) has been applied to the European Soil14\nDatabase (Heineke et al., 1998) and a preliminary map, Figure 2, produced, showing15\nthe inherent susceptibility of subsoils to compaction. As emphasised, this is only the16\nfirst stage in assessing the vulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction. To17\ncomplete the process in the future, climatic data must be overlaid on the soil data and18\nfurthermore it is necessary to evaluate the impact land use.19\n20\nFigure 2 shows a provisional distribution of susceptible subsoils in Europe, a21\ndistribution which must not be interpreted as actual vulnerability to compaction. A22\nspatial analysis of this distribution has revealed the following proportions for the 423\nsusceptibility classes: low 20%; moderate 44%; high 28%; very high 9%. Thus more24\nthan a third of European subsoils are classified as having high or very high25\nsusceptibility to compaction and more than 75% moderate or high susceptibility. The26\npatterns of high and very high susceptibility are mainly associated with areas of coarse27\nor organic soils.28\n29\n4.2. Vulnerability classification30\n31\nTable 3 classifies the vulnerability of subsoils to compaction on the basis of inherent32\nsoil susceptibility, climatic zone (defined by potential soil moisture deficits and the33\nduration of field capacity, measured in days) and topsoil strength. The influence of the34\ntopsoil condition is included, since this can have a significant effect on the degree of35\n\u2018protection\u2019 provided to the subsoil. In situations where the topsoil is loose and weakly36\nstructured, or where it is very wet and tends to flow on loading, the vulnerability rating37\nin a number of situations will increase.38\n39\nThe vulnerability classes defined in Table3 must be considered as assessments of40\naverage vulnerability under average climatic conditions, with consequent insensitivity41\nfor seasonal extremes. At field level, the operator may have access to real soil moisture42\ndata and\/or antecedent weather data and should be able to adjust the average43\nvulnerability rating accordingly.44\n45\nWhilst loads and pressures are not incorporated into the above classification, they have46\nbeen included in a further development by Spoor et al. (in press), specifically to47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n10\nprovide soil management\/machinery guidelines to minimise the risks of subsoil1\ncompaction. The more vulnerable the subsoil the greater the attention that needs to be2\npaid to loads and pressures to which soils are subjected if subsoil compaction is to be3\navoided.4\n5\n4.2.1. Application of vulnerability classification6\n7\nIt must be stressed that the vulnerability classification has been developed as a guide to8\nthe likelihood of subsoil compaction occurring. It should not, however, be considered9\nas rigid and binding. There are some fine textured (codes 3,4 and 5 in Table 2), low10\ndensity, weakly structured subsoils with very limited macroporosity, where only a11\nsmall reduction in this porosity would have a very significant adverse effect on their12\nphysical properties. In such cases, whilst the vulnerability classes assigned to these13\nsoils would be similar to those of equivalent soils with greater macroporosity, field14\nexperience indicates their sensitivity to the effects of compaction would be greater.15\nTherefore choosing a higher vulnerability rating would provide a greater margin of16\nsafety against damage at high moisture contents. Conversely, in dense strong coarsely17\nstructured soils, it may be possible to reduce the vulnerability rating. The influence of18\nthe load, pressure, soil sensitivity and actual field moisture status aspects on19\nvulnerability to compaction is considered in detail in Chamen et al. (in press).20\n21\nSpecific examples identified in Table 4, are taken from a range of soils in the British22\nlowlands that, with the exception of Fladbury Series (a Fluvisol), are under continuous23\narable cropping and farmed using large-scale equipment. The Susceptibility and24\nVulnerability Classes identified follow closely field experience in terms of the25\nsituations where subsoil compaction problems have been observed. The average26\npotential soil moisture deficits for these soils lie within the 126-200mm climatic zone27\n(Jones and Thomasson, 1985).28\n29\nThe Naburn and Newport (soils (Arenosols) are very easily compacted; compaction30\npans form very readily and if broken compaction could develop at much greater depths31\nin the subsoil. Subsoil compaction in these soils is, however, easily corrected and the32\nsubsoils rarely if ever become anaerobic.33\n34\nWisbech , Wick, Romney (12 % clay) and Agney series soils having slightly more clay35\nare less susceptible to subsoil compaction than the loamy sands (Arenosols). The36\nWisbech and Agney soils in particular have very firm subsoils full of vertical biopores.37\nThese biopores are the old root channels of the tidal zone vegetation that grew there38\nduring soil formation. They constitute the main pathways for root, air and water39\nmovement and are extremely resistant to collapse under vertical loads. However, shear40\nforces disrupt them immediately and hence deep cultivation operations could have a41\ndisastrous effect on subsoil quality. All these soils tend to be under intensive cropping42\ninvolving vegetables and root crops with consequent early and late season trafficking.43\n44\nHanslope (35% clay) and Evesham (45% clay) series soils (luvisols) are mainly used45\nfor growing combinable crops They are naturally compact and hence very resistant to46\nfurther subsoil compaction. Their subsoils comprise coarse prismatic structural units47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n11\nwhich, due to the swelling and shrinking nature of the high clay fraction, remain1\nlargely saturated in themselves to moisture contents below permanent wilting point2\n(Spoor and Godwin, 1979).3\n4\nThe Fladbury series clay soil (60% clay) is of low density and frequently extremely5\nwet, but rarely in continuous arable cropping. Being a Fluvisol, its \u2018susceptibility to6\ncompaction\u2019 rating for a given packing density is increased relative to non-Fluvisols,7\ndue to its very low density (see footnote Table 2). Although the subsoil comprises of8\nextremely stable micro-aggregates it is moderately vulnerable to compaction at high9\nmoisture contents. Under grassland with a firm topsoil, the subsoil is well protected10\nagainst damage. Subsoil damage is only likely when subjected to excessively high11\nloads that can cause considerable sinkage under wet conditions.12\n13\n14\n5. Discussion15\n16\nAn estimate of the area in Europe occupied by soils that are vulnerable to subsoil17\ncompaction is currently an urgent requirement. This is necessary to ensure that18\ncompaction, in both agricultural and environmental contexts, is considered by policy19\nmakers as an on-going, as well as serious, degradational hazard, together with erosion20\nand pollution.21\n22\nThe inherent susceptibility to subsoil compaction, estimated from soil properties, is the23\nfirst step to assessing vulnerability. The vulnerability classification proposed here is24\nintended for guidance and, at this stage, should not be regarded as definitive. However,25\nmodifications to susceptibility and vulnerability classes can be made in specific26\nsituations, taking account of local factors and management aspects, as illustrated in the27\nprevious section. Particular attention needs to be given to soil wetness at the time of28\ntrafficking and to the particular loads and pressures being applied. Whilst the29\nmagnitude of axle loads is often emphasised, it is crucial that the importance of ground30\npressures is given equal attention. Appropriate reductions in contact pressures can,31\nwithin wide limits, mitigate the effects of high axle loads on the potential for subsoil32\ncompaction (Chamen et al., in press)33\n34\nThe only practical means whereby areas at risk of subsoil compaction can be identified35\nat the European level is by building links between the scheme proposed here and the36\nEuropean Soil Database. The computerised geometric and attribute data in this37\ndatabase provide the necessary inputs, at the simplest level, to assess inherent38\nsusceptibility to subsoil compaction. To obtain vulnerability, climatic data must be39\n\u2018overlaid\u2019 on the inherent susceptibility.40\n41\nThe agrometeorological database for the MARS Project, held at the Joint Research42\nCentre, contains data that are suitable for computing a moisture index such as potential43\nsoil moisture deficit. The database contains average data on temperature, evaporation44\nand rainfall for 50km x 50km grid squares covering the whole of Europe (for this grid45\nnetwork see Zdruli et al. 2001). These data should provide the basis for generating the46\npotential soil moisture deficit (PSMD) data that are needed to convert susceptibility47\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n12\ninto vulnerability. However, for future policy-making and implementation, PSMD will1\nbe needed at resolutions better than 50km x 50km, for example 25km x 25km or 20km2\nx 20km. This is because climatic conditions in much of Europe can vary considerably3\nover distances smaller than 50km.4\n5\nAt the next stage of developing a European vulnerability map, it is probably not6\nappropriate to attempt to map the relative differences between the vulnerability classes7\nbased solely on the European Soil Database. In the policy-making context, it is8\nprobably sufficient to categorise subsoils more simply as either vulnerable or not9\nvulnerable. A simplified classification indicated in Table 5 is suggested as a basis for10\nthis.11\n12\nIt is essential in future that land use and generalised crop cover data are also included13\nin the final vulnerability assessments. Table 6 attempts to portray the impacts of land14\nuse and cropping systems, interacting with climatic phenomena to accentuate, or15\nmodify, soil loading.16\n17\n18\n6. Conclusion19\n20\nOn the basis of the existing information described here, any attempt to identify the21\nvulnerability to compaction of subsoils in Europe, on a spatial basis, lends itself to22\nfundamental improvement.23\n24\nInitially, the main tasks for future improvement of the approach described in this paper25\nare:26\n1. Combine existing climatic data (at 50km x 50km intervals) with inherent soil27\nsusceptibility data to produce estimates of subsoil vulnerability to compaction.28\n2. Improve the resolution of the agrometeorological data at European level, preferably29\nto 25km x 25km;30\n3. Incorporate the quantitative results from recent soil mechanics-research (Van den31\nAkker, 1999, Van den Akker and Canarache, 2001);32\n4. Use pedotransfer functions based on the latest research, for example those33\ncomputed by Horn and Fleige (2000).34\n35\nThe relevance of this type of modelling, applied through a soil map at 1:1,000,00036\nscale, may be questioned. It may be more appropriate at scales of 1:50,000 or larger,37\nwhere real crop performance in specific fields, or where detailed management38\ninterventions, are being evaluated. It is clear that the basic data to run such models at39\nscales larger than 1:1,000,000 will be lacking for some parts of Europe for many years40\nto come. In the absence of these data, however, the approach described in this paper41\noffers the best chance of achieving results that are satisfactory enough for broad scale42\npolicy-making in the immediate future.43\n44\nAcknowledgements45\n46\nVulnerability of subsoils in Europe to compaction\nJones, Spoor and Thomasson\n13\nThe authors are indebted to Luca Montanarella, secretary of the European Soil Bureau,1\nthe Joint Research Centre, Ispra (I), for help and encouragement throughout the2\npreparation of this paper.
