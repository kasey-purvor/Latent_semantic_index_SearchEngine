Uncolonized during the eighteenth century, \nby the turn of the nineteenth century the Islands were at the centre of increasingly \nimportant trading routes between India and China. In 1793, the East India Company \nmoved to occupy the Andamans as a penal colony, directing the transportation of all \nBengal life convicts there to work on land clearance, cultivation, and other projects.2 \nIt shipped about three hundred convicts to the Islands,3\nForty or fifty years later, during the 1840s and 1850s, Andamans inhabitants \nmade a series of attacks on distressed seamen and passengers. In the context of the \nsignificance of eastward sea routes through the Bay of Bengal, the British decided that \nif they could not be \u2018pacified\u2019, they had to be \u2018colonized\u2019. After one especially violent \nincident in mid-1855, the government of India asked the commissioner of Arakan \n(Burma), Henry Hopkinson, to journey to the Islands and report back.\n but the settlement was ravaged \nby disease and within three years the British had abandoned it. The Company \ntransferred the surviving convicts to its penal settlement in Penang. We know little \nmore of this ill-fated attempt at colonization; most particularly with respect to the \nnature and extent of contact with the Islands\u2019 indigenous peoples. Indeed, dating from \nMarco Polo\u2019s travel writing in the thirteenth century there was a widespread belief \nthat the Andamanese were at best savages and at worse cannibals. \n4\n \n Hopkinson\u2019s \nanalysis is worth citing at some length, for it reveals some of the strategic thinking \nthat informed his pro-settlement report: \n                                                 \n1 This collection was first presented as part of a panel at the British Association of South Asian Studies \nannual conference, University of Leicester, 26-8 Mar. 2008.  \n2 Oriental and India Office Collections, British Library (OIOC) P.128.7 (Bengal Judicial, 20 Dec. \n1793): H.

That instead of \noffering a refuge to the miserable storm-driven vessel, they should be a snare in her \npath leading to utter destruction, and in place of engaging the enterprise, and \nfurnishing subsistence to thousands of industrious colonists, they should be left in the \npossession of a handful of degenerate negroes, degraded in habits and intelligence to a \nlevel little above the beasts of the forest with which they dwell.5\n \n \nThough Governor-General Canning had his doubts about the viability and expense of \ncolonization, the government of India and the East India Company\u2019s court of directors \nwere broadly in favour of it.6 Their view was strengthened when shortly after \nHopkinson returned to Arakan a group of Andamanese killed eight Chinese traders \nafter they went on shore in search of water.7 Magistrate of Tenasserim J.C. Haughton \nwrote: \u2018[I]t appears highly discreditable in a civilised Government to allow such a \nstate of things to exist within a sea, one may say, bounded by its own territories and \non the high road to many of its chief emporia.\u20198\nBut the immediate background to colonization was not the desire for relations \nwith the Andamanese but the Great Revolt, a widespread military and civilian \nuprising that spread across the north of the subcontinent during 1857-8. Jail breaking \nwas a central element of the Revolt, and rebels completely destroyed or badly \ndamaged dozens of prisons and set thousands of prisoners free. Though the British \ncrushed the rebellion, it was left with a dire shortage of prison accommodation for \nrecaptured or newly convicted felons. At the same time, fearful of \u2018politically \ndangerous\u2019 rebels, the East India Company\u2019s penal settlements in Burma and the \nStraits Settlements turned away the usual shipments of transportation convicts from \n \n                                                 \n5 Henry Hopkinson, Commissioner of Arakan, to Grey, 8 Feb. 1856, cited in Portman, A History of our \nRelations, Vol. I, 190-7 (quote 191).  \n6 Grey to Dalrymple, 29 Feb. 1856, cited in Portman, A History of our Relations, Vol. I, 189. \n7 Governor-General Canning to the Court of Directors, 22 Apr. 1856, enc.

This constituted an unprecedented penal crisis, and so the \ngovernment turned its attention to the Andamans for a second time. It transported the \nfirst shipment of convicts to the Islands in March 1858; tens of thousands followed \nduring the period to the 1920s.9\nDrawing on a relatively rich colonial archive, histories of the Andamanese \nhave centred on the devastating effect of colonization and on nineteenth-century \ndebates around their supposed \u2018racial\u2019 origin, for contemporary scientists thought that \nthey could provide clues to the origins of humankind.\n \n10\nThe volume opens with Anderson\u2019s discussion of the first ever photographs \ntaken in the Andaman Islands, by the photographer Oscar Jean-Baptiste Mallitte (c. \n1829-1905). Mallitte accompanied the survey party sent by the government of India to \nthe Islands in 1857-8, its brief to find the best site to situate a penal colony for \nmutineers and rebels sentenced to transportation after the Great Revolt of 1857. The \nMallitte prints have long since been assumed lost or destroyed, but recently a curator \nat Windsor Castle identified them as an uncatalogued set in the Queen\u2019s Collection. \n The articles presented here \nseek to build on this dual interest through an analysis of the representation of the \nIslands\u2019 indigenous peoples over time \u2013 photographic, lithographic, three-\ndimensional, and textual - in the context of the parallel social meanings ascribed to \nlandscape, space, and community. Further, they seek to open up discussion on the \nmulti-layered relationships between images, objects, and texts, most particularly with \nrespect to the slippages between text and image\/ object, and the nature and context of \ntheir reproduction, distribution, and consumption. The authors focus on these \ninterrelationships in order to suggest the centrality of visual and discursive \nrepresentation for the production of historicity. Finally, moving through and beyond \ntrajectories of historical change aligned typically with colonialism and post-\ncolonialism, the papers coalesce around the issue of representation to focus on the \nAndamans as a connected \u2013 rather than isolated - space, geographically, culturally, \nand imaginatively. \n                                                 \n9 Clare Anderson, The Indian Uprising of 1857-8: prisons, prisoners, and rebellion, London, Anthem, \n2007.  \n10 Elizabeth Edwards, \u2018Science Visualized: E.H. Man in the Andaman Islands\u2019, in Elizabeth Edwards \n(ed.)

As the photographic process was described in some detail in various \ncontemporary publications, and because the photographs were widely copied and \npublished as engravings, she shows how the images enable us for the first time to \ninterrogate some of the textual and visual interconnections and slippages that were \nimplied during the written production and visual transformation of the earliest \nphotographs and engravings of the Islands. She suggests that the photographs are of \nhuge significance as visual signifiers of the violence of colonization, as evidence of \nsome of the ambivalences that characterized colonization through penal \ntransportation, and as a sort of \u2018missing link\u2019 that enables us to examine some of the \nways in which the Islands and its peoples were constructed and represented both \ndiscursively and visually through the trope of colonial \u2018tropicality\u2019. \nIn her fascinating analysis of the colonial exhibitionary complex, Wintle\u2019s \narticle takes the theme of representation further, exploring the production of \nAndamanese and British identities and histories in the decades following colonization. \nShe shows how the British reinvented imaginatively Andamanese \u2018identity\u2019 in a \nvariety of guises. For the government of India officials posted on the Islands, \nAndamanese peoples became part of an everyday working and living environment. \nOthers, including readers of anthropological journals and miscellanies in the UK \nproduced them as scientific \u2018evidence\u2019 central to socio-evolutionary debates of the \nperiod. For the wider population, the Andamanese became part of what Wintle terms \nthe \u2018tangible fantasy\u2019 of how Britain imagined Empire. By examining representations \nof Islanders as three-dimensional statues at Victorian international exhibitions, she \nexplores how the Andamans were positioned in the mechanics of the exhibition \nparadigm and how this positioning intervened in the popular imagination, thus lending \nnew understanding to how the \u2018colonial exotic\u2019 was employed as dynamic visual \nentertainment for and infiltrated into the psychology of a metropolitan audience.  \nThe final article presented here, by Vishvajit Pandya, shifts the focus to the \npresent day. He unpicks some of the complexities of contemporary representations of \nthe Andamans through an analysis of Bourdieu\u2019s invocation of intent and surplus in \nphotographic meaning. Pandya focuses on events in the Andamans in the aftermath of \nthe 2005 tsunami as a means of examining the overlapping textual and visual \n 5 \nproduction of the \u2018hostile\u2019, \u2018stone age\u2019 people of North Sentinel Island. He shows how \nthis politics of representation has been constituted historically and consolidated \npolitically through an often-unacknowledged collaboration between the state, media \nand non-indigenous Andamans settlers. His paper is an important reminder of how the \nconstruction of news from the Andamans is itself a cultural subject that requires an \nethnographic, semiotic, and analytical focus to comprehend fully the complex \ntensions between different forms of representation. With the Sentinelese the only \nAndamanese tribe not yet incorporated into the mainstream nation-state, Pandya \nbrings the papers full circle. He shows how text and image form a specific \nrelationship in the visual depiction of subjects as \u2018constant\u2019 over historical time, in the \nface of evidence of the Sentinelese as a connected and far from timeless community. \n"}
