Introduction \n \nDue to the availability of systems for extensive use of \ndigital data, significant interest in data hiding became \nperceptible during the last decade. It has become \nevident that intelligent hiding of a piece of data or \ninformation within another digital data could address \nmany practical applications like covert communications, \ncopyright protection and content authentication [1]. \nThere has been a growing interest in the authentication \nwatermarking of binary document images such as text, \ncircuit diagrams, signature, financial and legal \ndocuments. For such images, hiding sufficient amount \nof data for secure authentication without creating \nvisible distortion is difficult. The previous method for \nlocalization in binary document images has been \nreported in [2]. In this method, the original image is \ndivided into many sub-images and each sub-image is \nwatermarked independently. A two-layer watermark is \nembedded imperceptibly using a block-wise data \nhiding technique to verify the integrity of watermarked \nimage and localizing any modification in it. In this \nmethod, the size of each sub-image is 128 128\u00d7  pixels; \nso its localization accuracy is not satisfactory. The \nblock-wise embedding used in this method also suffers \nfrom a parity attack. While imperceptibly embedding \nthe authentication signature in a block, the number of \nlow-distortion pixels should be high and the watermark \ndetection process should be blind. In a reasonable \nblock-size, an insufficient number of low-distortion \npixels are available. So we turn our attention to the \npossibility of embedding the erasable or invertible [3] \nwatermark for localization in binary document images. \nIn the proposed method, a set of suitable pixels with \nhigh correlation is found in each block and they are \nlosslessly compressed to construct an erasable \nwatermark.  \n \nAuthentication schemes using block-wise independent \nwatermarks for localization are vulnerable to the \nHolliman-Memon attack [4].  In this attack, the attacker \ncreates the forged image by a collage of authentic \nblocks and the forged image is authenticated. A \ncountermeasure using unique image index has been \nproposed to resist this particular attack in grayscale \nimages [5]. Recently, a new countermeasure against the \nHolliman-Memon attack using authenticity measure is \nproposed for grayscale images [6]. The concept of \nauthenticity measure is of particular interest to this \npaper and is extended for the case of binary document \nimage authentication.

The paper is organized as follows: in \nSection 2 the new localization method is described. \nSimulation results and discussions are presented in \nSection 3. Finally some conclusions are given in \nSection 4. \n \n2. Proposed Localization Method \n \nIn this section, we propose a localization method for \nembedding the authentication signature as an erasable \nwatermark in each block of the document image. In the \nproposed method we find a set of pixels in each block \nsuch that; (1) a high correlation exists among the pixels \nand the number of such pixels is high (2) the same set \nof pixels can be found at blind detector and (3) the \nrelevant information is preserved after the embedding \nprocess. In a document image, the black pixel whose all \nneighbor pixels are white is termed as an isolated pixel. \nThese pixels are perceived as noise in a sharply-\ncontrasted binary image. A white pixel whose all \nneighbor pixels are white is termed as a background \npixel. \n \nThe isolated and background pixels do not convey \nimportant information within document images. If these \npixels are altered, a background noise will be formed in \nthe image. In document images, we obtain information \nby recognizing various patterns like text, drawing, \nsignature etc. It is known that human vision has \nremarkable ability to recognize such patterns even in \nthe presence of noise. After embedding an erasable \nwatermark in these pixels, the user can still obtain \nrelevant information about the document. The \nbackground pixels occur in long sequences and isolated \npixels occur in between them with less probability. \nSuch a set of pixels can be significantly compressed \nusing the run-length coding scheme. Flipping of a \nbackground pixel creates an isolated pixel and vice-\nversa; so blind detection of the embedded pixels is \npossible.  \n \nEmbedding: \n1. The original image is divided into non-overlapping \nblocks of 40 40\u00d7  pixels. Watermarking is performed \nfor each block independently and in a sequential \norder. \n2. In each block, an ordered set of insignificant pixels \nare searched in a sequential scanning order. The \nfollowing conditions are designed to ensure that after \nflipping the current pixel, an insignificant pixel \nshould not be detected as a pixel which is not \ninsignificant and vice-versa during blind detection. A \npixel is defined as a pseudo-insignificant pixel, if it \nsatisfies conditions (a) and (b) but does not satisfy \ncondition (c). A pixel is defined to be in the \ninsignificant pixel set if, \na. The pixel is either a background pixel or an \nisolated pixel. \nb. In a J J\u00d7 pixel window, there should not be \nany insignificant or pseudo-insignificant \npixel already found in the block. \nc. After flipping the current pixel, there should \nnot be any pixel in its 8-pixel neighborhood \nwhich comes before in the scanning order \nand satisfies the above two conditions.  \nThe minimum value of J is 5 for achieving correct \nblind watermark detection. The insignificant pixel \nset is losslessly compressed using the run-length \ncoding scheme. Let the compressed data be \ndenoted as DC . \n3. Authentication signature\n1S  is computed from the \nblock according to the following equation \n1 ( , , , )b b KS H C K I I=  (1) \nwhere H, bC , K, bI and KI  denote hash function, \ncurrent block in the original image, secret key, \nblock index and image index, respectively. \n4. The message m which is embedded in the \ninsignificant pixel set producing the watermarked \nblock is constructed. There are three parts \nconcatenated in m; (1) the compressed data DC , (2) \n16-bit image index \nKI  and (3) the authentication \nsignature 1S .  \n5.  The embedding is performed pixel-wise; so an \ninsignificant pixel holds one bit of m and its pixel \nvalue is set equal to the signature bit it holds. \nLikewise all blocks in the image are watermarked. \n \nDetection: \n1. To verify each block in the test image 'X of \nsize M N\u00d7 , the message 'm  is extracted by \nfinding the insignificant pixel set. Its component \npieces, the compressed version of insignificant \npixel set 'DC , image index \nd\nXI  and  the signature \n'\nSA  are extracted. The compressed version of the \ninsignificant pixel set together with the current \nblock is used to reconstruct the block '\nbC .  \n2.

A matrix ( )R of ( )40M  rows and \n( )40N columns is constructed while computing \n''\nSA  for each block. Each entry of R  represents a \nparticular block in image 'X  in a sequential order. \nThe magnitude of an entry in R  is 1 if 'SA  and \n''\nSA  exactly match in the corresponding block; \notherwise it is equal to 0.  \n4. Different image indices can be extracted from all \nthe blocks in 'X . Let each such index be termed \nas the candidate image index ( c\nXI ). For each \nc\nXI , \nthe authenticity score (\nSA ) is computed by \napplying the image index estimation algorithm. \n5.

Results and Discussions \n \nIn this section, we present simulation results by \ncreating the erasable watermark for our proposed \nlocalization method. The authentication signature to be \nused in this algorithm is the Hashed Message \nAuthentication Code (HMAC). The output 128-bit \nHMAC is used as the authentication signature and the \nmessage \u2018m\u2019 is constructed for each block. The original \nand watermarked images are shown in Figure 1 after \npixel-wise embedding of the erasable watermark. With \nno tampering, all blocks in the watermarked images are \nauthenticated. To illustrate the localization capability \nof the proposed method, the characters in the word \n\u2018Primary\u2019 at the left and bottom portion of the image \nare removed and the attacked image is shown in Figure \n2. The detection is performed on the attacked image \nand the inauthentic blocks are shown in the \nreconstructed image in Figure 2.  \n \nWe consider two binary document images of size \n480\u00d7520 pixels for demonstrating the effectiveness of \nthe proposed method against the Holliman-Memon \nattack. The first original image and its corresponding \nwatermarked image are shown in Figure 3. Similarly, \nthe second original image and its corresponding \nwatermarked image are shown in Figure 4. The 16-bit \nimage indices with the decimal equivalent of 48056 \nand 56273 were used for the first and second images \nrespectively. The fake image was constructed as \nfollows. The equation in the last rows of the second \nwatermarked image was added into the first \nwatermarked image. For this purpose, 8 blocks with the \nblock indices of 146 to 153 in the first watermarked \nimage were replaced with the corresponding blocks in \nthe second watermarked image. The block replacing \noperation was performed for a total of 8 blocks and the \nfake image is shown in Figure 5. According to the \nHolliman-Memon attack, the blocks between the two \nwatermarked images are swapped at identical positions; \nthus each block of the fake image should be \nauthenticated. The proposed detection method was \nused to verify each block in the fake image. A total of 8 \nblocks out of 156 blocks in the fake image were \nverified to be inauthentic in Figure 5. The estimated \nimage index is 48056 and the authenticity measure of \nthe fake image is approximately 0.9.  \n \nThe performance of the proposed algorithm can be \ncompared with the previous method [2]. The \nlocalization accuracy in the proposed method has been \nimproved to the block-size of 40\u00d740 pixels.

Conclusion \n \nIn this paper, we proposed a new watermarking method \nthat is useful in localizing content alteration in binary \ndocument images using erasable watermarks. The \nproposed method can localize content alteration in the \nimage with high probability and accuracy. The \nlocalization accuracy is significantly improved and the \nproposed method is capable of withstanding the parity \nand the Holliman-Memon attack. \n \n5. References \n \n[1] M. D. Swanson, M.
