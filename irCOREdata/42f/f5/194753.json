HF radar backscatter which has been artificially-\ninduced by a high power RF facility such as the EISCAT\nheater at Troms\u00f8 has been demonstrated to provide iono-\nspheric electric field data of unprecedented temporal reso-\nlution and accuracy. Here such data are used to investigate\nULF wave processes observed by the CUTLASS HF radars.\nWithin a short period of time during a single four hour ex-\nperiment three distinct wave types are observed with differ-\ning periods, and latitudinal and longitudinal phase evolution.\nCombining information from the three waves allows them to\nbe divided into those with a large-scale nature, driven exter-\nnally to the magnetosphere, and those with small azimuthal\nscale lengths, driven by wave-particle interactions. Further-\nmore, the nature of the wave-particle interactions for two dis-\ntinct small-scale waves is revealed, with one wave interpreted\nas being driven by a drift resonance process and the other by\na drift-bounce resonance interaction.

Ionosphere (active experiments; wave-particle\ninteractions) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (MHD waves and in-\nstabilities).\n1 Introduction\nIn general, magnetospheric Ultra Low Frequency (ULF)\nwaves which have an energy source external to the Earth,\nsuch as an impulse in the solar wind, solar wind buffeting, or\nthe Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the magnetopause, are\ncharacterised by small effective azimuthal wavenumbers m,\n(or equivalently a large scale size in the azimuthal direction).\nConversely, it is now widely accepted that an energy source\nfor small-scale, high-m ULF waves exists in drifting ener-\ngetic particle fluxes through drift and drift-bounce resonance\ninteractions. Such high-m waves are a topic of considerable\nCorrespondence to: T. K. Yeoman\n(tim.yeoman@ion.le.ac.uk)\nimportance in both theoretical and experimental studies at\npresent. Energetic particles entering the Earth\u2019s inner mag-\nnetosphere from the magnetotail will experience gradient-\ncurvature drift and thus move around the Earth, constitut-\ning part of the global ring current. The drifting particles can\ndrive MHD wave modes through wave-particle interactions,\nleading to perturbations in the electric and magnetic fields in\nthe magnetosphere and ionosphere when free energy is avail-\nable to the wave. It has been suggested (e.g. Southwood,\n1976; Hughes et al., 1978) that the part of the ion distribution\nfunction which is able to feed energy into the wave is when\n\u2202f\/\u2202W > 0, where f is the ion distribution function and W\nis the energy. Such non-Maxwellian ion distribution func-\ntions can be created quite commonly by naturally-occurring\nprocesses in the magnetosphere, such as substorm-associated\nparticle injections. Subsequent to such an injection the ions\nwill gradient-curvature drift westwards, where they will on\noccasion match the local drift-bounce resonance condition\n(Southwood et al., 1969),\n\u03c9wave \u2212mwave\u03c9drift = N\u03c9 bounce (1)\nwhere N is an integer (usually \u00b11) and \u03c9wave, \u03c9 bounce, and\n\u03c9drift are the angular frequencies of the wave, the proton\nbounce, and the proton azimuthal drift, respectively. Such\nwave-particle interactions are a process of fundamental im-\nportance in collisionless astrophysical plasmas.\nThe ionosphere modifies the magnetospheric ULF wave\nsignature, leading to rotation and attenuation of the wave\nmagnetic signature detected on the ground (e.g. Hughes and\nSouthwood, 1976; Hughes, 1983). This attenuation of the\npulsation magnetic perturbation below the ionosphere is pro-\nportional to exp(\u2212kz) (e.g. Hughes and Southwood, 1976)\nwhere k is the field perpendicular component of the wave\nnumber and z is the E-region height. It is thus clear that\nground magnetometer data is far from optimal for the study\nof high-mULF waves, and that direct observation in the iono-\nsphere or magnetosphere is usually required. In particular,\ntwo categories of particle-driven waves have been intensively\nstudied with ground-based data: storm time pulsations and\n160 T. K. Yeoman and D. M. Wright: ULF waves with drift resonance and drift-bounce resonance energy sources\ngiant \u2018Pg\u2019 waves, which are dusk and dawn sector phenom-\nena, respectively.\nStorm time Pc5 pulsations have been seen in STARE (the\nScandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment; Greenwald\net al., 1978) data (Allan et al., 1982, 1983). They are com-\npressional waves of high m number (m = \u221220 . . .\u221280; here\nnegativem is taken to represent westward phase propagation)\nand frequency in the Pc5 range (1.7\u20136.7 mHz) which are as-\nsociated with a drift resonance source mechanism. Drift res-\nonance involves fundamental wave modes, with the electric\nfield symmetric about the equator (i.e. an equatorial elec-\ntric field antinode). Storm-time Pc5s are observed in the\ndusk sector during magnetically disturbed intervals. Simi-\nlar waves, but with an equatorward phase motion, have been\nseen in SABRE (the Sweden And Britain auroral Radar Exp-\neriment; Nielsen et al., 1983) and BARS (Bistatic Auroral\nRadar System; McNamara et al., 1983) coherent radar sys-\ntems in the dusk sector by Yeoman et al. (1992) and Grant et\nal. (1992) respectively.\nThe second class of particle driven ULF waves of inter-\nest are giant \u2018Pg\u2019 pulsations which have been observed on\nthe ground as well as by orbiting satellites at times when\ngeomagnetic conditions are quiet. Pgs are an example of a\nparticle-driven ULF wave which may be studied with ground-\nbased magnetometers. Chisham and Orr (1991) presented a\nstatistical study of 34 of these events observed on the EIS-\nCAT magnetometer cross network in northern Scandinavia.\nThey found a peak in occurrence of these waves in the dawn\/\nprenoon sector and no events were observed in the afternoon.\nThe average value of the azimuthal wave number was \u223c\u201326\nfor the 34 events. Pgs have been related to drift-bounce res-\nonance mechanisms with both symmetric (e.g. Takahashi et\nal., 1992) and antisymmetric (e.g. Chisham and Orr, 1991)\nwave modes, and the wave-particle interaction responsible\nfor their generation thus remains controversial.\nRecent results from DOPE (the DOppler Pulsation Experi-\nment; Wright et al., 1997) at Troms\u00f8 in northern Norway\nhave demonstrated the existence of populations of high-m\nwaves in both the morning and afternoon sectors (Yeoman et\nal., 2000). In this case the morning sector waves were the\nmost populous, and had m-numbers in the order of 100, high\nenough to screen the waves completely from ground mag-\nnetometers. The structure and occurrence of such particle-\ndriven waves have been studied by a number of authors in\nthe magnetosphere with in situ spacecraft data, for both case\nstudies (e.g. Hughes et al., 1979; Takahashi et al., 1990)\nand statistically (e.g. Kokubun, 1985; Takahashi et al., 1985;\nAnderson et al., 1990; Woch et al., 1990; Engebretson et al.,\n1992; Lessard et al., 1999). These studies are largely consis-\ntent with the ground-based results, identifying a strong pop-\nulation of particle-driven waves in the dusk sector. Events\nare also detected near dawn however, and a variety of wave-\nparticle interaction modes have been invoked. In this paper,\nthe HF radar artificial backscatter technique is used to pro-\nvide a dataset for the study of particle-driven ULF waves of\nboth symmetric and antisymmetric modes in the postnoon\nsector.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe data presented here result from the generation of artifi-\ncial ionospheric HF coherent backscatter. It is well known\nthat the EISCAT Heating facility at Troms\u00f8, Norway (Ri-\netveld et al., 1993) is capable of generating artificial field-\naligned irregularities using high power HF radio waves (e.g.\nRobinson, 1989). These irregularities are detectable by both\nincoherent and coherent scatter radars (e.g. Robinson et al.,\n1997). It is possible, given favourable ionospheric condi-\ntions, to modify the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling con-\nditions with facilities such as the Troms\u00f8 heater. Typically\nsuch experiments use modulated E region electrojet heating\n(e.g. Robinson et al., 2000). The present study involves\nunmodulated F region heating during quiet magnetospheric\nconditions, with the main electrojet currents lying far north of\nTroms\u00f8. The action of the heater is thus restricted to increas-\ning the backscatter cross-section which the F region iono-\nsphere offers to HF coherent radars. The CUTLASS (Co-\noperative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System) radar\nis an HF coherent backscatter radar system located at Han-\nkasalmi, Finland and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland, and forms part of\nthe SuperDARN array (Greenwald et al., 1995). CUTLASS\nis ideally situated for making observations of the heated vol-\nume over Troms\u00f8 (e.g. Bond et al., 1997; Eglitis et al., 1998),\nas shown schematically in Fig. 1a. Here data is presented\nfrom the SP-UK-OUCH (Observations of ULF waves with\nCUTLASS and the Heater; Wright and Yeoman, 1999b) ex-\nperiment. In this experiment the CUTLASS radars run in a\nhigh temporal and spatial resolution mode, with Hankasalmi\nrunning a 6-beam scan (scanning beams 7 through to 2, inclu-\nsive) with an integration time of 1 s, whilst \u00deykkvib\u00e6r runs\na 3-beam scan (beams 13\u201315) with a 2 s integration period.\nThus, both radars produce data with a temporal resolution\nof 6 s and both run in a high spatial resolution mode, with\neach radar having 75 range gates of 15 km length, centred\non the heated volume at Troms\u00f8. The EISCAT heater was in\ncontinuous operation at 50% power (using 6 X 80 kW trans-\nmitters, an ERP of \u223c130 MW), at a frequency of \u22484 MHz\nfor 4-hour intervals. The heater produces artificial electron\ndensity irregularities in the F region ionosphere, which act\nas targets for the HF radar. The artificial targets have been\ndemonstrated to accurately track the natural ionospheric con-\nvection velocity, and the backscatter obtained is of very high\npower and very narrow spectral width. This allows a short\nintegration time to be run on the radar, providing higher time\nresolution than is normally available. The narrow spectral\nwidths also produce ionospheric electric field measurements\nof unprecedented accuracy (Yeoman et al., 1997; Wright and\nYeoman, 1999a,b). Sample coherent and incoherent scatter\nspectra from natural and artificial irregularities are illustrated\nin Fig. 1b, c.\nData are also presented from the IMAGE (International\nMonitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects; L\u00fchr, 1994) mag-\nnetometer station at Troms\u00f8 (TRO, location 69.7\u25e6 N, 18.9\u25e6 E\ngeographic), which has a sampling interval of 10 s.\nT.

Un-\nprecedented spatial, temporal and electric field resolution is\nachieved. Figure 2 presents a colour-coded representation\n(flow away from the radars (negative velocities) are colour\ncoded red, with flow towards the radars (positive velocities)\ncolour-coded blue) of the l-o-s (line-of-sight) velocity mea-\nsured by the CUTLASS Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radars\nfor several radar range gates over the complete four hour ex-\nperiment. Figure 2a presents l-o-s velocity from beam 5 of\nthe Hankasalmi radar. This beam points roughly meridion-\nally, and the data is plotted as a function of magnetic lati-\ntude. Figure 2b presents l-o-s velocity from beam 15 of the\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r radar, which is directed roughly azimuthally east-\nwards, as a function of magnetic longitude. A region of the\nhigh latitude ionosphere of roughly one degree in both lat-\nitude and longitude is illuminated by the EISCAT heater at\nTroms\u00f8. Complex and variable wave activity is clear in data\nfrom both radars. The wave characteristics in three different\nintervals are examined here: Interval 1, a period of large-\nscale field line resonance activity; Interval 2, a period of low\nfrequency, small-scale wave activity and Interval 3, a higher\nfrequency, small-scale wave.\n3.1 Interval 1: 1230\u20131300 UT\nInterval 1 is presented in more detail in Fig. 3, which il-\nlustrates data from 1230\u20131300 UT. L-o-s velocity data only\nfrom Hankasalmi is presented, with the colour-coded veloc-\nities from a number of range gates plotted as a function of\nmagnetic latitude in panel 3a. Panel 3b presents the l-o-s\nvelocities in a simple timeseries format, whilst panels 3c, d\npresent X and Y component data from the underlying TRO\nmagnetometer (which lies under range gate 32). The clear-\nest wave signature in this interval is between 1250 and 1300\nUT, although higher frequency waves are detectable before\nthis. A poleward phase progression can be observed in Fig.\n3a, b and the longer period wave is also visible in both com-\nponents of the Troms\u00f8 magnetograms. An analysis of the\nspectral power and phase of the wave is shown in Fig. 4.\nFigure 4a presents a Fourier power spectrum of the wave ob-\nserved in the Hankasalmi velocity data from beam 5, range\ngate 28. The dominant Fourier component is at 5.7 mHz, al-\nthough some evidence of higher frequency wave activity at\n\u223c16 mHz is also apparent. The magnetic latitude profile of\nFourier power and phase deduced from the radar data at 5.7\nmHz is shown in Fig. 4b. The wave shows some evidence\nof poleward phase propagation, and has an amplitude peak at\nthe equatorward edge of the region of artificial scatter close\nto 65.6\u25e6 magnetic latitude. Only latitudes poleward of the\nresonance location are within the artificial scatter region, and\nthis presumably precludes the observation of the full 180\u25e6\nphase change expected around resonance (e.g. Walker et al.,\n1979). Figure 4c illustrates a velocity hodogram formed from\nmerging l-o-s velocities from the Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r\nradars. An elliptical, anticlockwise polarisation is seen (note\nthat in this case the hodogram is for a later period of sim-\nilar wave activity to Interval 1, for which data was avail-\n162 T. K.

The three intervals of data which will be examined further are\nindicated with solid vertical lines.\nable from both Hankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r). A comparison\nof beams 4 and 5 of the Hankasalmi radar, and azimuthally\nseparated stations of the IMAGE magnetometer array reveals\nthat the wave has an azimuthal wavenumber, m = +6 \u00b1 3,\ni.e. an eastward phase propagation, in the direction of the\nsolar wind flow. This wave is interpreted as a fundamental,\nlarge-scale toroidal field line resonance centred near 65.6\u25e6\nmagnetic latitude. The smaller wave at 16 mHz has a simi-\nlar low m-number and is interpreted as a harmonic of the 5.7\nmHz large-scale toroidal wave. This smaller amplitude wave\nis not detected by the ground magnetometer at Troms\u00f8.\n3.2 Interval 2: 1300\u20131330 UT\nInterval 2 is presented in the same format as Interval 1 in\nFigs. 5 and 6, covering 1300\u20131330 UT. The wave in Inter-\nval 2 shows a clear equatorward phase propagation (Fig. 5a,\nb). It is only very weakly present in the Troms\u00f8 magnetome-\nter records (Fig. 5c, d). The characteristics of the wave in\nthe radar data are examined in detail in Fig. 6. The Fourier\npower spectrum in Fig. 6a shows a dominant frequency in\nthis interval of 3.8 mHz. The magnetic latitude profile of\nFourier power and phase between 2.8\u20133.8 mHz (Fig. 6b)\nconfirms the strong equatorward phase propagation, and the\nwave can be seen to have a maximum amplitude at or above\nthe poleward edge of the region of artificial backscatter at\n66.0\u25e6 magnetic latitude. A comparison of beams 4 and 5\nof the Hankasalmi radar reveals an azimuthal wavenumber,\nm = \u221235 \u00b1 6. The wave thus has an effective azimuthal\nwavenumber much larger than the Interval 1 wave, and prop-\nagates westward in a direction opposite to the solar wind\nflow, but in the direction of gradient-curvature drifting pro-\ntons. The merged velocity hodogram from a subset of Inter-\nval 2 in Fig. 6c shows the wave to have a more linear polar-\nisation than the large scale waves similar to those examined\nin Interval 1, but again have anticlockwise polarisation.\n3.3 Interval 3: 1330\u20131400 UT\nInterval 3 is again presented in the same format as Interval\n1 and 2, in Figs. 7 and 8, covering 1330\u20131400 UT.

The Fourier power\nspectrum in Fig. 8a shows a dominant frequency in this in-\nterval of 14.3 mHz. The magnetic latitude profile of Fourier\npower and phase between 14.3 \u2212 15.4 mHz (Fig. 8b) con-\nfirms the poleward phase propagation, and the wave can be\nseen to have a maximum amplitude close to 65.7\u25e6 magnetic\nlatitude. A comparison of beams 4 and 5 of the Hankasalmi\nradar again reveals an azimuthal wavenumber, m = \u221235\u00b16.\nThe wave thus has an effective azimuthal wavenumber much\nlarger than the Interval 1 wave, but very similar to the wave\nin Interval 2, and again in a direction opposite to the solar\nwind flow, but in the direction of gradient-curvature drifting\nprotons. The merged velocity hodogram from a subset of\nInterval 3 in Fig. 8c shows the wave to have a very linear\npolarisation.\n4 Discussion\nThe artificial backscatter technique has provided an extended\ninterval of very high resolution ionospheric velocity data,\nwhich has allowed the accurate characterisation of wave pa-\nrameters such as frequency, latitudinal evolution of Fourier\nphase and amplitude, and wave polarisation within the iono-\nsphere for 3 different, naturally-occurring ULF waves. These\nwave characteristics, described in Sect. 3, have revealed three\nvery different wave types, occurring within 1.5 hours. Taken\nindividually, each wave type would be difficult to interpret\nunambiguously. Here the three intervals will be considered\nin turn and in combination, in order to provide a convincing\nexplanation of the complete interval. The wave parameters\nand interpretation for the three intervals are summarised in\nTable 1.\n4.1 Interval 1: large-scale field line resonance\nInterval 1 (Fig. 3) has a frequency of 5.7 mHz and an az-\nimuthal wavenumber, m = +6, indicating phase propagation\nin the solar wind flow direction. It is thus a large scale wave\nand as such, it is also observed by the IMAGE magnetometer\nat Troms\u00f8. This wave is interpreted as a fundamental, large-\nscale toroidal field line resonance with an energy source ex-\nternal to the magnetosphere. The wave is not of great inter-\nest in itself, but in the interval under study it does provide\nan evaluation of the fundamental toroidal eigenfrequency of\nthe field line at 65.6\u25e6 magnetic latitude, which provides an\ninvaluable context for the very different wave types which\nfollow directly after Interval 1. In order to make predictions\nas to the frequencies of other possible wave modes in the ar-\ntificial scatter, numerical solutions of the MHD equations for\nthe ratios of toroidal and poloidal eigenfrequencies and har-\nmonics for a dipole field at the latitude of geosynchronous\norbit are employed (Cummings et al., 1969). Cummings\nand co-authors presented tabulated frequencies for the first\n6 harmonics for radial plasma density models r\u2212n, where\n0 \u2264 n \u2264 6. These predict that for a toroidal fundamental\nresonance frequency of 5.7 mHz at 65.6\u25e6 magnetic latitude,\nthe corresponding second and third harmonic frequencies lie\nbetween 11.8\u201315.3 mHz and 17.5\u201324.6 mHz, respectively,\nfor both the toroidal and poloidal mode (the range of values\nbeing a function of the plasma density model adopted). The\nfundamental poloidal frequency at this latitude is calculated\nto be 4.2 mHz (this value is insensitive to the plasma density\nmodel). A correction of \u223c10% would apply for resonances\noccurring at the poleward edge of the artificial scatter region\ndue to the longer field lines connecting to this region (Mathie\net al., 1999) and thus, leading to a predicted poloidal eigen-\nfrequency in that location of 3.8 mHz.\n4.2 Interval 2: drift resonance\nInterval 2 (Fig. 5) has a wave with a frequency of 3.8 mHz\nand an azimuthal wavenumber m = \u221235, and shows clear\nequatorward phase motion. The wave thus has azimuthal\nphase propagation opposite to the solar wind flow, but in\nthe direction of gradient-curvature drifting protons. The fre-\nquency of this wave lies in the region expected for the fun-\ndamental poloidal mode, as deduced in Sect. 4.1. The fun-\ndamental poloidal wave is thought to be driven by drift res-\nonance with westward moving, large pitch angle protons as\nsuggested by Southwood and Kivelson (1982), and illustrated\nschematically in Fig. 9a. Interaction with the fundamental\nwave which has a symmetrical electric field is probably the\nonly viable mode for drift resonance. The interaction will\nbe strongest for large pitch angle protons which are confined\nnear the equator where the wave electric field is strongest.\nT. K. Yeoman and D. M.

Trajectories of two ions (solid and dashed lines) in the wave rest frame. Shaded and unshaded regions represent positive and negative\nelectric field respectively. The ions indicated with a solid line are in resonance with the N = 0 drift mode, and the ions represented by the\ndashed line with the N = 1 drift-bounce resonance (after Southwood and Kivelson, 1982).\nUsing the drift resonance equation (e.g. Hughes, 1983) the\nangular frequencies of the azimuthal evolution of the wave,\n\u03c9wave and particles, \u03c9drift may be related by\n\u03c9wave #2 = mwave #2\u03c9drift . So \u03c9drift = (\u03c9\/m)wave #2 . (2)\nThis gives a value for \u03c9drift of 6.8 \u00b7 10\u22124 rad s\u22121. An ex-\npression of the angular frequency of drifting protons in the\nEarth\u2019s reference frame as a function of proton energy has\nbeen given by Chisham (1996) as\n\u03c9drift = \u22126WL(0.35+ 0.15 sin\u03b1)\nBsR\n2\nE\n+ 90(1\u2212 0.159Kp + 0.0093K\n2\np)\n\u22123L3 sin\u03c6\nBsR\n2\nE\n, (3)\nwhere W is the proton energy in eV, L is the proton\u2019s L-shell,\nBs is the equatorial surface magnetic field strength, RE is the\nradius of the Earth, \u03b1 is the proton equatorial pitch angle,\n\u03c6 the azimuth of the particle measured anticlockwise from\nlocal midnight and Kp the planetary magnetic activity in-\ndex. The first term on the right hand side of Eq. 3 represents\ngradient-curvature drift and the second E \u00d7 B drift under a\nmodel magnetospheric potential. Where the actual magneto-\nspheric electric field can be estimated from measured iono-\nspheric electric fields from radar data, as in this example, the\nequation may be replaced with\n\u03c9drift = \u22126WL(0.35+ 0.15 sin\u03b1)\nBsR\n2\nE\n+ EL\n2\nBsRE\n(4)\n(Chisham et al., 1992), where E is the magnetospheric elec-\ntric field. In the example presented here, Eqs. 3 and 4 give\nconsistent results and suggest that the energy of drifting pro-\ntons which might drive the Interval 2 wave via drift resonance\nis 47\u00b1 10 keV for large pitch angle protons.\n4.3 Interval 3: drift-bounce resonance\nInterval 3 (Fig. 7) has a wave with a frequency of 14.3 mHz\nand an azimuthal wavenumber, m = \u221235. The wave thus\nhas azimuthal phase propagation opposite to the solar wind\nflow, but in the direction of gradient-curvature drifting pro-\ntons, as is the case for Interval 2. The frequency of this\nwave lies in the region expected for the second harmonic\npoloidal mode, as deduced in Sect. 4.1. The second har-\nmonic poloidal wave is thought to be driven by drift-bounce\nresonance with westward moving, small pitch angle protons\nas suggested by Southwood and Kivelson (1982), and illus-\ntrated schematically in Fig. 9b. If a drifting energetic proton\npopulation is to provide an energy source for Interval 3, then\nit must be able to satisfy the drift-bounce resonance condi-\ntion, Eq. 1. This condition can only be met for N = \u00b11\nfor wave modes with antisymmetric electric fields. The in-\nteraction will be the strongest for particles of smaller pitch\nangles, which spend appreciable amounts of time near the\nwave electric field antinodes.\nThe drift angular frequencies for particles with small pitch\nangles can again be evaluated as a function of particle energy\nusing Eqs. (3) or (4). The bounce angular frequencies for\nsuch particles are given by\n\u03c9b = pi\n\u221a\nW\u221a\n2mpLRE(1.3\u2212 0.56 sin\u03b1)\n(5)\n(Glassmeier et al., 1999; Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974), where\nmp is the proton mass. Substituting these values into Eq. (1)\nfor N = +1 yields a quadratic equation in \u221aW . Solution of\nthis quadratic yields a proton energy of 34\u00b110 keV for small\npitch angle particles. Substitution back into Eqs. (2) and (4)\ngives a value for the drift and bounce angular frequencies of\n\u03c9drift = 4.6 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b7 10\u22124 rad s\u22121 and \u03c9b = 0.09 \u00b1 0.02 rad\ns\u22121, respectively. In fact, using Eqs. 3 or 4 for the pro-\ntons of 47 keV associated with Interval 2, but with small\npitch angles, gives a slightly reduced angular frequency of\n\u03c9drift = 5.5 \u00b7 10\u22124 rad s\u22121 (compared to the 6.8 \u00b7 10\u22124 rad\ns\u22121 deduced from Eq. 2 above for interval 2). Thus, we\nconclude that we need a positive slope in the proton distribu-\ntion function in the region 35\u201345 keV to explain the observed\n168 T. K. Yeoman and D. M. Wright: ULF waves with drift resonance and drift-bounce resonance energy sources\nwave behaviours in both Interval 2 and Interval 3. Further-\nmore, the pitch angle dependence of the drift period of the\nprotons is consistent with the arrival of large pitch angle par-\nticles slightly in advance of smaller pitch angle particles, and\nthus the driving of the drift mode (Interval 2) slightly before\nthe drift-bounce mode (Interval 3), as is observed.\n4.4 Relationship with previous observations\nOf the previously reported ground-based observations of ULF\nwaves, the waves identified in Intervals 2 and 3 of the re-\nported run of the SP-UK-OUCH experiment most closely re-\nsemble those identified in naturally occurring coherent radar\nbackscatter. The spatial resolution of such radars is \u223c15 km\nand thus these instruments are much more sensitive to small-\nscale waves than ground magnetometers. Such small-scale\nwaves observed by coherent radar have previously been clas-\nsified as storm-time Pc5s (Allan et al., 1982, 1983; Walker\net al., 1982) and equatorward propagating Pc5s (Grant et\nal., 1992; Yeoman et al., 1992). Storm time Pc5 waves are\nthought to have an energy source in gradient-drifting ener-\ngetic particles in the dusk sector during disturbed times, and\nare generally interpreted as examples of drift resonance, al-\nthough Allan et al. (1983) pointed out that no one generation\nmechanism was able to explain all the observed wave char-\nacteristics. A similar interpretation was placed on the dusk\nsector equatorward propagating waves observed by Yeoman\net al. (1992) and Grant et al. (1992). Gradient-curvature\ndrift for protons with energies in the range 35\u201370 keV were\ndeduced to be the driving mechanism for the storm time Pc5\npulsations of Allan et al. (1982, 1983). Such particle popu-\nlations are also consistent with the equatorward propagating\nPc5 pulsations observed by Yeoman et al. (1992) and Grant\net al. (1992). The wave observed here in Interval 2 is fully in\naccord with these observations and their interpretation, pro-\nviding high time resolution bistatic data of an equatorward\npropagating drift wave in the dusk sector. The wave polar-\nisation observed here was near-linear with the polarisation\nellipse tilted north-west to south-east. This is also very sim-\nilar to the bistatic radar results of Allan et al. (1982, 1983),\nGrant et al. (1992) and Walker et al. (1982). Walker et al.\n(1982) mapped such polarisation ellipses out into the equa-\ntorial plane magnetosphere and demonstrated that they were\nconsistent with poloidal wave modes. In Intervals 2 and 3 the\nULF waves had a weak or non-existent signature in ground\nmagnetometer data, as small-scale waves suffer attenuation\nthrough the ionosphere. This is again consistent with pre-\nvious results. Related spacecraft observations include those\nfrom Kokubun (1985), Anderson et al. (1990), Engebret-\nson et al. (1992) and Lessard et al. (1999) who observed\nPc5 band ULF waves in the magnetosphere which were most\ncommon at dusk and were most likely storm-time Pc5 pul-\nsations. At lower occurrence rates, events have also been\nobserved in the dawn region within the magnetosphere and\ntheir relative occurrences have been discussed by Yeoman et\nal. (2000).\nThe wave in Interval 3, in contrast, appears to result from a\nsecond harmonic due to bounce-resonance interactions. This\nwave resembles ground-based magnetometer observations of\ngiant pulsations (Pg) which have a similar m-number (Chis-\nham and Orr, 1991). Pg events have also been observed by\nauroral radar (Chisham et al., 1992) and occur in the morn-\ning sector in the 02\u201307 MLT interval, peaking in the range\n03\u201306 MLT. A drift-bounce resonance interaction with an\nantisymmetric wave mode in the quiet time ring current has\nbeen suggested as the likely mechanism causing this type of\nULF wave (e.g. Chisham and Orr, 1991), although Pgs have\nalso been related to drift-bounce resonance mechanisms with\nsymmetric wave modes (e.g. Takahashi et al., 1992). Sim-\nilar events in the morning sector, detected by DOPE, were\nreported by Yeoman et al. (2000). The spatial resolution\nof the DOPE sounder is \u223c4 km (Wright et al., 1997) and\nthus it has the ability to detect ULF wave signatures with\nvery small spatial scale sizes. These events were charac-\nterised by higher m-numbers (\u223c\u201390), and the wave particle\ninteraction mode responsible for their generation is, as yet,\nunclear. Studies directed more towards the investigation of\nindividual events have also provided related measurements\nfrom space, and a small number of direct measurements of\nm in space have been reported as well. Hughes et al. (1979)\ndescribed multiple satellite observations of a high frequency\n(18.2 mHz) compressional wave at geostationary orbit in the\ndusk to midnight local time sector. The wave number m was\ncalculated to be \u2212100. Hughes et al. (1979) deduced that\nthe wave was a second harmonic standing wave which led to\ntheir interpretation of the driving mechanism being a bounce\nresonance interaction with ring current protons of energy 1\u2013\n10 keV. A similar interpretation was placed on a wave with\na frequency of 5 mHz and |m| \u223c 110 in the postnoon sector\nstudied by Takahashi et al. (1990). These events appear to be\nsimilar to the Interval 3 event identified here, although with\na higher m-number.\nTakahashi et al. (1985) made multi-spacecraft measure-\nments of ULF waves in the frequency range 1\u20133 mHz. These\nworkers were able to directly measure the azimuthal wave-\nnumbers in the magnetosphere for a number of wave events,\nfinding m = \u221240 . . . \u2212 120, which is similar to those pre-\nsented here. The distribution of such events found by Taka-\nhashi et al. (1985) was symmetrical about noon. Woch et al.\n(1990) presented a study of compressional events observed\nat geostationary orbit. Two populations of events were iden-\ntified, one being a \u201cdiamagnetic\" population, which occurred\nduring an increase in the measured ion intensities, and was\nconcentrated at the dusk sector. The second population was\ntermed a \u201cnon-diamagnetic\" population, which was not asso-\nciated with recently injected particles, and was concentrated\non the dawn flank. Both populations were interpreted as be-\ning antisymmetric modes.\nThe interval presented here demonstrates that the dusk sec-\ntor is a region where drift resonance is a viable source of\nwave energy in the Pc5 band, as expected. What the data\nalso demonstrates is that bounce-resonance interactions can\nalso occur in the same region. The ground-based technique\nof artificial radar backscatter opens a new window on such\nT. K. Yeoman and D. M. Wright: ULF waves with drift resonance and drift-bounce resonance energy sources 169\nevents, and bounce-resonance waves in the postnoon sector\nwith m \u223c \u221235 are reported. It appears that a drifting particle\npopulation with a positive gradient in its proton distribution\nfunction can couple to ULF wave modes of both fundamen-\ntal and second harmonic frequencies. The slower drifting\nlarger pitch angle particles interact first with the fundamen-\ntal, with the slightly delayed small pitch angle element of the\npopulation finding a preferred wave-particle interaction with\nthe second harmonic slightly later on. Wright and Yeoman\n(1999a) presented an example of a high-m wave in artifi-\ncial backscatter which appeared to be a harmonic of a pre-\nexisting large-scale wave. They suggested that this might be\nan example of the seeding of high-m waves by low-m waves,\nas suggested by Allan and Wright (1997), although at a har-\nmonic, rather than at the fundamental. The present observa-\ntion strengthens this interpretation, with the low-m wave co-\nexisting with both fundamental and second harmonic high-m\nmodes. In addition, a mechanism for the evolution from the\nhigh-m fundamental to the second harmonic has been sug-\ngested in the differential drift speeds of gradient-curvature\nparticles of different pitch angles. The observation of both\ndrift resonance and drift-bounce resonance interactions in the\ndusk sector has implications for the interpretation of the in-\nteractions responsible for previous and future observations of\nULF waves driven by wave particle interactions in this sec-\ntor. The dawn sector, in contrast, appears to be dominated\nby bounce-resonance interactions. Future observations will\nbe able to determine if drift resonances are sustainable in the\ndawn region.\n5 Summary\nThe artificial backscatter technique has provided an interval\nof bistatic ionospheric electric field data during a complex\nperiod of wave activity. Unprecedented spatial, temporal and\nelectric field resolution is achieved. A large-scale (low-m)\nfield line resonance is observed, and gives the fundamental\ntoroidal eigenfrequency as 5.7 mHz. Subsequently, small-\nscale (high-m) particle-driven waves are also observed at fre-\nquencies of 3.8 and 14.3 mHz, near the expected frequencies\nof the fundamental and second harmonic poloidal modes, as\ndeduced from the large-scale field line resonance observa-\ntions. These two waves are consistent with a drift wave and a\nbounce-resonance energy source, respectively, with a driving\nparticle population at 35\u201345 keV. It appears that the postnoon\nsector can support both drift resonance and drift-bounce res-\nonance interactions for waves with m \u223c \u221235.\nAcknowledgements.
