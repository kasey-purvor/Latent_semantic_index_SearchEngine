From this it follows that to be \n\u2018necessary and sufficient for\u2019 is a symmetric relation, that is, that if P is a \nnecessary and sufficient condition for Q, then Q is a necessary and sufficient \ncondition for P. This view is acknowledged to be contrary to common sense. \nIn this paper I point out that it is also contrary to a widely accepted \nontological view of conditions, according to which if P is a necessary and \nsufficient condition for Q, then Q is no sense a condition for P; it is a mere \nconsequence of P.  \n \nKey words: Necessary and sufficient conditions, Conditionality, Ontology, \nWertheimer, Causality, Truth-functional analysis \n1. Introduction \nThe truth-functional analysis of conditions has undeniably become the standard view of \nconditions even though it is known to suffer from some difficult problems, e.g. that it \nfails to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant conditions; any true statement is a \nnecessary condition for any other truth. However, this paper concerns another problem, \nnotably, that the truth-functional view depicts the relationship between conditions and \ntheir consequences as being in a certain sense symmetrical; if p is a necessary condition \nfor q, then q is a sufficient condition for p. The truth-functional understanding of \nconditionals conflicts with the common sense view, say, that writing a thesis is necessary \nfor getting a degree, but getting a degree is not sufficient for writing a thesis. The degree \nis a mere consequence of the writing. Getting a degree (not to be confused with the \npromise of getting a degree) cannot contribute to the writing, since it is only awarded on \nthe condition that the thesis is completed.  \nThe symmetry between the terms of conditional claims is further strengthened, on the \ntruth-functional account, in the case of conditions that are both necessary and sufficient; \nthe converse relationship assumed to hold between necessary and sufficient conditions \nentails that if p is a necessary and sufficient condition for q, then q is likewise a necessary \nand sufficient condition for p. This, again, runs counter to the common sense view that \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 2 \nlightning is necessary and sufficient for thunder while thunder is in no sense at all a \ncondition for lightning. Lightning makes thunder come about, but not vice versa. \nThe idea that necessary and sufficient conditions are converse relations has been \nchallenged before, e.g. by an appeal to counterexamples. The challenge rests on the \nobservation that if the truth-functional analysis is correct, then it should always be \npossible to paraphrase sentences of the form \u201cif p occurs, then q occurs\u201d as \u201cp occurs \nonly if q occurs\u201d. One well-known counterexample is \u201cif you touch me, I\u2019ll scream\u201d \n(McCawley 1993, p. 317). It is evident that the speaker does not imply that he will be \ntouched only in case he screams, or indeed intend the screaming to be any kind of \ncondition for being touched. Hence the sentence cannot be paraphrased as \u201cyou touch me \nonly if I scream\u201d.  \nI think that not only are there the occasional counterexample to the standard view, but \nthat in ontology every example can arguably be portrayed as a counterexample. Like \nRoger Wertheimer (1968), I think it is not adequately appreciated that there exists an \nontological understanding of conditionality that fits to the common sense view, and \nwhich is incompatible with the truth-functional analysis. The incompatibility between the \nontological understanding and the truth-functional analysis has been largely overlooked \nin the discussion about conditionals, even though the ontological understanding is often \nimplicitly assumed in ontology.  \nFor instance, it is assumed in the issue on metaphysical necessity that it makes a \ndifference whether necessity can be defined in terms of possible worlds or if necessity or \nessence defines possible worlds. Thus it is assumed that it makes a difference whether de \nre modality should be defined in terms of possible worlds in the following way,  \nfor any entity e, e is essentially F, iff e is F in every world where e exists,  \nor if it should be the other way around, \nfor any entity e, e is F in every world where e exists, iff e is essentially F.  \nOn the truth-functional view the two are equivalent and the dispute meaningless. \nIt should be mentioned that I presuppose that the truth-functional analysis is not \nintended to be a mere stipulation or analytic definition of conditionality, comparable to \nthe definition of what it is to be a perfect circle (which allegedly to not obtain in reality). \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 3 \nIt\u2019s acceptance, as a standard theory of conditionality, at least in ontology, must rest on \nits perceived success in correctly capturing the nature of conditionality (or at the least be \nperceived as the best theory available).  \nI should also say that I take the issue about conditionality, in ontology, to revolve \naround the conviction that things just don\u2019t occur in a haphazard manner; that they occur \nonly under certain circumstances in a lawful manner. The problem has been to give an \naccount of the relationship between the things that occur, and the different part of the \ncircumstances that determine whether they occur or not.  \n2. The Truth-Functional Understanding of Conditionality and its Limits in Ontology \nThere is a basic understanding of conditions that I think everybody agrees upon, and \nwhich you will find in any textbook in which the notion of condition is explained. This is, \nfirstly, that a sufficient condition is something that, if satisfied, guarantees that \nsomething else obtains; p is a sufficient condition for q if q obtains whenever p obtains; \ni.e. \u2018if p then q\u2019. For instance, lightning is a sufficient condition for thunder because \nwhenever there is lightning there is also thunder. Secondly, that a necessary condition is \nsomething that must be satisfied in order for something else to be true; p is a necessary \ncondition for q if q cannot obtain without p, i.e. \u2018q only if p\u2019. For instance, lightning is a \nnecessary condition for thunder, because unless there is lightning there will not be \nthunder. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition is something that, if satisfied, \nguarantees that something else obtains, and is the only thing to do that; p is a necessary \nand sufficient condition of q if q obtains whenever p obtains and only when q obtains; i.e. \n\u2018q if and only if p\u2019. For instance, lightning is both necessary and sufficient for thunder, \nbecause there is always thunder when there is lightning and only then.  \nHowever, according to the truth-functional analysis, \u2018necessary for\u2019 and \u2018sufficient \nfor\u2019 are converse relations, i.e. it depicts \u2018if p then q\u2019 as equivalent to \u2018p only if q\u2019, and \nlikewise \u2018q only if p\u2019 as equivalent to \u2018if q then p\u2019. This entails in its turn that \u2018p iff q\u2019 is \nequivalent with \u2018q iff p\u2019. Accordingly, on the truth-functional analysis, thunder is a \nnecessary and sufficient condition for lightning just as much as lightning is a necessary \nand sufficient condition for thunder.  \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 4 \nThe mutual conditionality between lightning and thunder, as depicted by the truth-\nfunctional view, doesn\u2019t comply well with either common sense or with what physics \ntells us about the nature of lightning, i.e. about the conditions under which lightning and \nthunder occur, respectively. Physically, thunder is explained as being the sound \n(vibrations in the air) produced by a surge of electricity between negatively and \npositively charged portions of humid air, i.e. thunder is explained in terms of the effects \nof a lightning. In other words, in order for thunder to occur, there must first occur a \nlightning, but thunder is not a part of the conditions that need to obtain in order for \nlightning to strike; thunder is a mere consequence of lightning. \nAs for common sense, the relation between conditions and consequences are clearly \nasymmetrical. An ordinary person saying \u2018I would have caught the bus if I had finished \nsooner\u2019 is talking about consequences of her actions (she missed the bus), and how things \ncould have turned out different as a consequence of having acted otherwise (she would \nhave caught the bus). Her claim is not equivalent to the claim that \u2018I had finished sooner \nif I would have caught the bus\u2019 as if her catching the bus could have somehow made her \nfinish sooner. Catching the bus could not have made her finish sooner, because she would \nhave had to finish sooner first in order to catch the bus; simply put, catching or missing \nthe bus is a mere consequence of when she finishes her job and not a condition at all for \nwhen she finishes her job (of course, her intention of catching the bus could persuade her \nto finish sooner, but the act of actually catching the bus could not have made her finish \nsooner). \nThe important distinction here is that whereas lightning is a necessary and sufficient \npart of the circumstances that allow the occurrence of thunder then thunder is not a part \nof the circumstances that allow lightning. Obviously, this reasoning is dependent on \nbringing in causal considerations, in particular it is dependent on a conception of \ncausality that is compatible with the idea that causes produce their effects, i.e. bring them \ninto existence. But then again, that causes produce their effects is at the heart of the \ncommon sense conception of conditionality, it is about the causes that make some things \ncome about and the circumstances that must obtain in order for the cause to be effective.  \nOn a roughly Humean interpretation of causation, lightning and thunder are events \nthat happen to always occur in pairs, and whose repeated observation \u2018produces\u2019 a \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 5 \ncognitive connexion between the idea of lightning and of thunder, which makes us \nalways expect to hear thunder when we see lightning. For the sake of argument, I will \nhappily concede that the truth-functional analysis is perfectly compatible with a \nconsistent Humean interpretation of causality, and continue to merely argue for its \nincompatibility with the idea that some circumstances make possible the coming into \nexistence of certain occurrences, while other make this coming into existence inevitable. \n3. The Ontological Understanding of Conditionality \nThe truth-functional understanding of conditions is the received view of conditions in \ncontemporary philosophy. However, in a certain brand of realist ontology, and in \ncommon sense, the idea of a mutual relationship between conditions and consequents is \nalien. The term \u2018necessary and sufficient condition\u2019 is there applied to a certain type of \nconditions, notably those that are both necessary and sufficient for the consequent, or for \na conjunction of antecedents that jointly are necessary and sufficient for the consequent, \nbut where the consequent is not a condition for the antecedent at all:  \na (or a1, a2...an) is necessary and sufficient for the existence of b, but b is \nneither necessary nor sufficient for the existence of a (or a1, a2...an). \nAccording to the realist view in question, ontology does not primarily deal with \nstatements and\/or propositions and their relations, but with the basic structure of the \nworld, the nature of the kinds of entities that inhabit it, and the relationships between \nthem.  \nFurthermore, it treats the truth of statements about reality as dependent on the nature \nof the reality these statements they are about, because it considers the truth of these \nstatements to be a consequence of their correspondence to facts. Contingent truth, \naccording to this view, is a property that cannot be possessed solely in virtue of truth-\nvalue links that hold between propositions independently of the relations of ontological \ndetermination that exist in the world. True, if \u2018there is thunder\u2019 is true, then \u2018there has \nbeen lightning\u2019 is also true, but not because the truth of \u2018there is thunder\u2019 itself warrants \nthe truth of \u2018there has been lightning\u2019 in virtue of a truth-value link, but because as a \nmatter of fact every thunder is produced by lightning. There is a truth-value link between \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 6 \n\u2018there is lightning\u2019 and \u2018there is thunder\u2019, because there is a causal link between lightning \nand thunder. \nAccording to the ontological view, a merely necessary condition is something, a, \nwhose existence is required for it to be possible for something else, b, to come about. The \ncondition a may itself not be enough to actually produce b. For a window to break when a \nbrick hits it with a certain force F, it is necessary that the window is fragile (a bullet proof \nglass would not break). It is therefore a necessary condition for the breaking that the \nwindow is fragile, but fragility itself never breaks any windows, hence it is not sufficient.  \nA merely sufficient condition is something which always and invariably produces the \nconsequent, but which may not be the only thing to do just that. A brick hitting a window \nwith the force F may be sufficient for the breaking of a fragile window, and therefore \ninvariably results in a broken window, but so can a blow by a baseball-bat and many \nother things as well. Hence, the hitting of a fragile window by a brick with the force F is \nnot a necessary condition; it could be broken by something else. A necessary and \nsufficient condition, in ontology, is something whose occurrence always and invariably \nproduces a certain consequence and is the only thing to do just that.  \nWhether there really exists anything which is both a necessary and sufficient \ncondition is a controversial matter in ontology, and the controversy of this issue coincides \nwith the controversy of the characterisation of causes as necessary and sufficient for their \neffects, i.e. it coincides with the search for a necessary connexion between cause and \neffect. Consequently, any suggested example of a necessary and sufficient condition will \nbe controversial. Perhaps the least controversial example of a single occurrence that is \nboth necessary and sufficient would be The Big Bang. It is, arguably, a necessary and \nsufficient condition for the present state of the universe. But usually we have two or more \nconditions that each are either merely necessary or merely sufficient, but together they \nare necessary and sufficient for the existence of the consequent, e.g. as suggested in \nMackie\u2019s analysis of causation in terms of INUS conditions (1965).  \nHowever, despite the controversy concerning the reality of necessary and sufficient \nconditions, then, in ontology, consequents are never assumed to be something whose \nexistence is required for the existence of the condition. The condition is something that \nmust be able to obtain in some way prior to (perhaps not always temporally prior, granted \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 7 \nthe possibility of simultaneous and backward causation) and independently of the \nconsequent. A lightning is in no way enabled by thunder, even though it may perhaps \nalways produce thunder. Not even backwards causation is a counterexample to this thesis. \nBackwards causation, if it were shown to occur, would only be a counterexample to the \nthesis that conditions must always precede their consequences in time, but not to the \nthesis that the condition is something that must be able to obtain in some way \nindependently of the consequence. \nThe notion of condition and consequence, as they are used in ontology, are, I admit, \nto some extent intuitive, and their precise determination would require us to settle the \ncontroversy regarding a number of ontological issues, in particular causality. But I do \nthink our intuitive understanding of them is adequate to the task of discussing the \ndifference between necessary and sufficient conditions in the logical and ontological \nsense.  \nThere is then in the notion of ontological condition the idea that the condition is \nexistentially nondependent on the consequent, while the consequent is existentially \ndependent on the condition (see Bunge 1959: p. 38 & 39; Wertheimer 1968). Please note \nthat this does not necessarily mean that the condition is temporally prior to the \nconsequence, just that the existence of the condition must be made possible by something \nother than the consequent. It could for instance be argued that vibrations in the air are \nproduced at the very same time as there is a surge of electricity, and yet it is the surge of \nelectricity that produces the vibrations and not vice versa. \nAlso note that \u2018condition for\u2019 or a \u2018consequence of\u2019, like \u2018necessary for\u2019 and \n\u2018sufficient for\u2019 is relational. No contingent state of affairs is a condition without being \nitself a consequence of something else. However, it cannot be a consequence of the very \nconsequence for which it is a condition. If condition and consequence are existential \nconditions for each other, then either both must always have existed (in which case it is \nnot clear in which sense they are existential conditions), or neither could ever exist \n(because neither could come into existence to make the existence of the other possible \nunless the other already existed). There is a third possibility, notably that both come into \nexistence together. But, then there must surely have been a condition c for the coming \ninto existence of a and b, and if conditions are always mutual then c must also have come \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 8 \ninto existence together with a and b; an infinite regress arises leading to the conclusion \nthat everything must have come into existence together in an initial unconditioned act of \ncreation. Again, this reasoning assumes that it makes sense to talk about entities as \ncoming into existence, since the idea of existential conditions makes no clear sense in an \neternalistic universe where everything exists in parity. \n4. Conditionality and Causality \nThe relation between cause and effect is the paradigmatic example of a conditional \nrelationship. The effect is for its existence dependent upon the occurrence of the cause, \nwhile the cause is not dependent for its existence upon the occurrence of the effect \n(however, the cause is surely dependent on some other prior condition). Paul has stomach \npains because he ate too much cake, but he did not eat too much cake because he has \nstomach pains. The effect is a consequence of the cause, but not vice versa. Striking a \nball with a tennis-racket is what makes the ball cross the net, while the crossing of the net \nby a ball is not what makes the ball being struck.  \nThere is a relationship between our knowledge about conditions and knowledge about \nconsequences, which may be taken to imply a mutual relationship between the truth of \nstatements about conditions and consequences. We can draw inferences about the truth of \nstatements about conditions on the basis of our knowledge about the truth of statements \nabout consequences. That the ball crosses the net might give us reason to think it had \nbeen struck (and hence to believe that \u2018the ball has been struck\u2019 is true). Consequently the \ntruth of \u2018the ball crosses the net\u2019 may be thought to be a condition for the truth of \u2018the \nball has been struck\u2019, in an epistemological sense. However, that does not make the \ncrossing of the net by the ball an ontological condition for the striking of the ball.  \nThe Big Bang (as far as we know) is the necessary and sufficient condition for the \npresent state of the universe, but the present state of the universe is not in any way a \ncondition for the occurrence of the Big Bang. The Big Bang existed long before the \npresent state of the universe came into existence. The present state of the universe (+ \nknowledge of the laws of nature) may be a condition for us knowing about the Big Bang \n(and hence to believe that \u2018the universe started in a Big Bang\u2019 is true), but the present \nstate of the universe did not in any way make it possible for the Big Bang to occur. Even \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 9 \nif the effect is inevitable, given the cause, so that cause and effect always occur together, \nthen it is the cause which is thought to produce the effect and not vice versa. Instead of \nthe effect being a necessary condition for the cause, in those cases, it is a necessary \nconsequence of the cause. \nThe fact that necessary and sufficient conditions have a necessary consequence, and \nthat therefore condition and consequence always occur together, may be what invites the \nidentification of conditional relationships with biconditionals. Consider the following \ndescription of causality: \u2018if C occurs then (and only then) E always and invariably \nfollows\u2019 (Bunge 1959, p. 47). Given this description of causality, then whenever it is the \ncase that C, it will also be the case that E, and whenever it is not the case that C, then it \nwill not be the case that E. Hence two statements about the existence of C and E will \nalways either be both true or both false. But this symmetrical truth-functional relationship \nbetween the truth-values of statements about C and E is here depicted on the ontological \nlevel as a consequence of a relationship of asymmetric existential dependency between C \nand E, a relationship whose asymmetrical nature the biconditional completely fails to \ncapture.  \nGalileo Galilei, which was allegedly the first to define a cause as being the necessary \nand sufficient condition for its effect, wrote: \u201cthat and no other is to be called cause, at \nthe presence of which the effect always follows, and at whose removal, the effect \ndisappears\u201d (cited by Bunge in (1959; p. 33). He did not say, as far as I know, that the \neffect is therefore a necessary condition for the cause in the sense that there has to be an \neffect before the cause can possibly come about, or that if the effect is removed the cause \ndisappears.  \nGalileo\u2019s analysis of causality can be much weakened without losing the basic \nasymmetry of the relationship between conditions and consequences, e.g. as in Mackie\u2019s \nanalysis of causation in terms of INUS conditions (1965). According to Mackie, a causal \nnexus is a complex of conditions, each of which are singularly insufficient but necessary \nfor the cause, but which together constitute an unnecessary but sufficient condition for \nthe effect. An electric spark may be a necessary condition for a fire in the attic, but \ninsufficient in the absence of flammable material to be ignited. Together an electric spark \nand flammable material may be jointly sufficient for a fire, but unnecessary in the sense \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 10 \nthat the fire could have been started by other means (e.g. by an arsonist with match-\nsticks). On Mackie\u2019s account as well, the effect is a consequence of the given conditions, \nand not in any sense a condition for the very conditions that brought it about.  \nOther generic relationships fall into the same mould. Parents are the condition for the \nexistence of their children, but children are not the condition for the existence of their \nparents. The parents could never have met and\/or never conceived of children together, or \nat least not conceived those particular children, and yet existed, while the children could \nnot have been conceived by any other parents. Of course, the individuals that are here \ndescribed as \u2018parents\u2019 would not have the relational property of being \u2018parents\u2019 unless \nthey had children, but the individual people involved are not for their existence dependent \non the children, and they could have become parents by producing other children than \nthey in fact did.  \nThere have been thinkers in the past who have argued that the causal relation is \nsymmetric, i.e. that the effect is just as much a condition for its cause as the cause is a \ncondition for its effects, e.g. Hegel (1873: pp. 215ff) and J.M.E. McTaggart (1915). On \ncloser scrutiny it turns out that theses thinkers are not concerned with the ontological \nrelation between causes and effects in the physical world, but with the logical relation \nbetween the concept of \u2018cause\u2019 and concept of \u2018effect\u2019, or between the concepts of \nparticular causes and effects, like \u2018parent\u2019 and \u2018offspring\u2019. The relationship between the \nconcept of \u2018cause\u2019 and the concept of \u2018effect\u2019 is mutual, according to Hegel, because an \nevent would not be conceived of as a \u2018cause\u2019 unless it was conceived as having an effect, \nand vice versa (1873: p. 215).  \nMcTaggart even argues that because it is not necessary that a person is drunk if he has \nbeen drinking (drinking does not imply drunkenness), but it is necessary that he has been \ndrinking if he is drunk (drunkenness implies drinking), then drunkenness is really the \ncause to the drinking and not vice versa (1915). The entire explanation of course neglects \nentirely the physiological account of the effects of alcohol consumption, and focuses only \non the relation of implication between concepts.  \nTo focus on the contents of concepts in our everyday conceptual scheme, follows \nnaturally from McTaggart\u2019s and Hegel\u2019s idealist philosophy, according to which there is \nno material world only mental content. But, if one does not accept their idealist approach, \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 11 \nwhich I certainly do not, one should at least clearly distinguish between conceptual and \nontological relationships, and take into account what empirical science tells us about the \nnature of physical objects.  \nThere can be, then, mutual conceptual dependencies, between concepts, e.g. between \nconceptual pairs like \u2018parent\/offspring\u2019, \u2018cause\/effect\u2019 in which case an understanding of \none term requires an understanding of the other. To conceive of someone as being a \n\u2018parent\u2019 is impossible without conceiving of him as having \u2018offspring\u2019, and no one is \nconceived as an \u2018offspring\u2019 without being at the same time conceived of as having a \n\u2018parent\u2019. There are also relations of semantic equivalence between expressions with the \nsame propositional content, i.e. expressions that have the same truth-conditions. \u2018John is \na bachelor\u2019 is equivalent to saying that \u2018John is an unmarried man\u2019. But, ontologically \nspeaking, the conditional relationship between living parents and their living offspring is \nnot mutual in this way.  \nAll in all, the idea that necessary and sufficient conditions are asymmetrically related \nto their consequences pervades ontology. Not just in the philosophy of causation but in \nthe philosophy of generic relationships in general. For instance, the idea is present in the \nnotion of one-sided existential dependency; the idea that some things are for their \nexistence dependent on something, but not vice-versa. Husserl was allegedly one of the \nfirst to introduce the notion of one-sided existential dependence. Eugenie Ginsberg \n(1931) later attempted to further develop his account and again Kit Fine in (1995). It has \nbeen used in the construction of so-called level ontologies, e.g. by Nicolai Hartmann \n(1949), Mario Bunge (1973), and Ingvar Johansson (1989). E.J. Lowe, has also recently \nargued for the existence of such a relation (1998, chapter 6). The distinction between the \nlogical and ontological understanding of conditionals is therefore of vital importance for \nmost ontological matters. \n5. A Final Word \nIt might be objected that the above may perhaps provide some reasons to reconsider the \nviability of the truth-functional account of conditionality, but that it does not give a clear \nalternative account of what a condition or a consequence is. I should then point out that I \nam not really suggesting that conditions should be understood in a different ontological \nFrom Metaphysica 9: 129-137 (Author\u2019s Copy) \n 12 \nsense than is already presupposed in the truth-functional account. The truth-functional \naccount presupposes, e.g. that a sufficient condition is something that, if satisfied, \nguarantees that something else obtains; \u2018if p then q\u2019. This is not a logical truth, but a \ngeneralisation of an ontological thesis. Indeed, the notions \u2018obtains\u2019 and \u2018guarantees\u2019, not \nforgetting \u2018true\u2019, in light of which \u2018if p then q\u2019 makes sense, are as intuitive in this \ncontext as are \u2018causes\u2019, \u2018determines\u2019, \u2018condition\u2019 or \u2018consequence\u2019.  \nLikewise the truth-functional view presupposes that a necessary condition is \nsomething that must be satisfied in order for something else to be true; \u2018q only if p\u2019. \nFinally, it presupposes that a necessary and sufficient condition is something that, if \nsatisfied, guarantees that something else obtains, and is the only thing to do that; \u2018q if and \nonly if p\u2019.  \nI have no qualms with the above characterisation of conditionality, because it is \nperfectly in accordance with the ontology of causality and existential dependence. \nIndeed, I think it is derived from ontology. What I object to is the idea that that a logical \ntruth-table analysis can then be used to tell us that, ontologically speaking, \u2018necessary \nfor\u2019 and \u2018sufficient for\u2019 are converse relations, and that \u2018necessary and sufficient for\u2019 is a \nsymmetric relation, independently of any ontological considerations. \nREFERENCES \nBunge, M.
