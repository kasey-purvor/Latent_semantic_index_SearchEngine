Channel estimation in MC-CDMA \nrequires transmission of pilot tones, based on which MMSE \ninterpolation or FFT-based interpolation algorithms are \napplied. Most channel estimation methods in literature assume \nperfect synchronization.

Multicarrier systems \nare very sensitive to synchronization errors. Uncorrected errors \ncause inter-carrier interference (ICI) and degrade the \nperformance significantly. In this paper, we analyze the effect of \nsynchronization errors on the performance of pilot-aided \nchannel estimators, and propose low complexity methods to \ncompensate the residual timing and frequency offset \nrespectively.  We estimate the timing offset in frequency domain \nby a single frequency estimation technique, and iteratively \nsearch the frequency offset based on the interference power at \nthe certain set of subcarriers. Simulation results show that our \nmethods improve the performance of channel estimators \nconsiderably in imperfect synchronization conditions.  \nI. INTRODUCTION \nMulticarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) has \nbeen considered as a promising candidate of air interface in the next \ngeneration wireless communications, which is capable to combat \nfrequency selective fading, flexible to generate different data rates \nand provides high bandwidth efficiency [2]. Multicarrier systems are \nvery sensitive to synchronization errors such as symbol timing error, \ncarrier frequency offset and phase noise. Synchronization errors \ncause loss of orthogonality among subcarriers and considerably \ndegrade the performance especially when large number of \nsubcarriers presents. There have been a lot of approaches on \nsynchronization algorithms in literature (e.g. [3]-[5]). Traditional \ntiming synchronization methods observe a large variance in \nmultipath fading channels due to the interference of delayed signals. \nHowever it is acceptable for coarse synchronization since it has been \nverified if the residual timing offset is shorter than the difference \nbetween length of the guard interval and that of the channel impulse \nresponse, it only appears a linear phase rotation across the subcarrier \nFFT outputs [1]. A close loop fine synchronizer is proposed in [7] \nwhich is based on a phase detector measuring interference power \ncaused by synchronization error. It also utilizes the tolerance of \nguard interval by setting the zero point of the phase detector inside \nthe guard interval instead of beginning of OFDM symbols. All of \nthese algorithms assume that channel estimator can identify the \nphase rotation later in coherent systems. On the other hand, there is \nalso a certain level of residual frequency offset after frequency \nsynchronization. Therefore, the channel estimator is expected to \nwork as a fine synchronizer which has some ability to \ncompensate residual time and frequency synchronization \nerrors.  \nChannel estimation in MC-CDMA is generally based on \nthe use of pilot subcarriers in given positions of the \nfrequency-time grid. Comparing with blind approaches, pilot-\naided methods provide more accuracy and require less \ncomputational complexity. A number of data-aided channel \nestimation algorithms have been proposed in literature either \nusing the least square (LS) criterion [11] or applying the \nminimum mean square error estimation [8]-[9] or time \ndomain transformation [10]. However, these channel \nestimation methods are evaluated assuming perfect \nsynchronization and do not guarantee the compensation of \nsynchronization errors without any modification. Analysis \nand simulation later in this paper will show that the residual \nsynchronization errors will degrade the performance of \nchannel estimators significantly if no compensation methods \nare applied. In this paper, we will analyze the effect of \nsynchronization errors on the performance of pilot-aided \nchannel estimators, either for FFT-based or MMSE-based \nones. And the synchronization error compensated channel \nestimator is proposed, where the residual timing offset is \nestimated in frequency domain by single frequency \nestimation technique and the residual frequency offset is \niteratively searched based on the interference power at the \ncertain set of subcarriers. The performance of the proposed \nalgorithm is then evaluated by simulation and compared with \ntraditional ones.  \n \nII. SYSTEM MODEL AND EFFECT OF SYNCHRONIZATION \nERRORS \nConsider a downlink MC-CDMA system with QPSK \nmodulation and Walsh-Hadamard sequence of length L as the \nspreading sequence. The discrete baseband model of the \nsystem is shown in Fig. 1. No channel coding and \ninterleaving are considered in our model.

Baseband model of the MC-CDMA system \nwhere kd are the data symbols and ikc , are the ith chip of the \nkth user. The spread data are modulated to N parallel-\ntransmitted subcarriers by IFFT (we set N=L for \nsimplification of evaluation since the result we get can be \nstraightforwardly extended to N\u2260L case), and the time \ndomain samples of base band signal are given by  \n1,\n1\n0\n\/2\n\u2212\u2264\u2264\u2212= \u2211\u2212\n=\nNnNebs g\nN\ni\nNinj\nin\n\u03c0  (2) \nAfter passing through a slow-varying frequency selective \nchannel (where channel coefficients keep constant during one \nOFDM symbol), the received signal in the presence of \nresidual frequency offset becomes \n\u2211\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n+\u22c5=\n1\n0\n\/2\nP\np\nnnnp\nNnj\nn wsher p\n\u03c0\u03b5  (3) \nWhere \u03b5  is normalized frequency offset and ph  is the \ncomplex gain of the pth path.

And effects of the frequency offset include two \nparts: one is the attenuation to useful symbols shown in Ef1, \nanother is additive ICI shown in Ef2.

And different methods to compensate these effects \nwill be discussed in the following sections.    \n \nIII. DATA-AIDED CHANNEL ESTIMATIONS \nThe traditional data-aided channel estimation algorithms \nconsist of two steps. First, estimates of the channel \ncoefficients over the pilot subcarriers are achieved by LS \ncriterion. Then the LS estimates are interpolated over the \nwhole time-frequency grid. The interpolation can be applied \nby means of MMSE filter [8]-[9] or FFT-based time domain \ninterpolation [10]. \n \nA. LS estimation of channel coefficients over pilot subcarriers \nPilot symbols can be considered as the sampling of the two-\ndimensional wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering \n(WSSUS) process represented by the mobile channels. Therefore, \nwe arrange the pilots into a rectangular grid in time-frequency \ndomain, and keep the distances between two pilots in time and \nfrequency dimension to satisfy the sampling theorem. The pilot \nsignals can be equal complex values or random generated date of \nunit amplitude. And the LS estimation is given by \n)(\/)()(\u02c6 , kbkSkH pppeq =    (7) \nwhere )()( iNbkb fp = is the transmitted pilot symbol and \nfN denotes the frequency spacing of pilots. According to (6),  \n)()(\/)()()(\u02c6 ',\n\/2\n,, kWkbkIekHkH ppici\nNkj\npeqpeq ++=\n\u03c0\u03c4  (8) \nIt shows in (8) that the LS estimation is susceptible to the phase \nrotation caused by timing offset and ICI caused by frequency \noffset. Since the final channel coefficients are obtained by \ninterpolation, they are heavily dependent on the accuracy of pilot \nchannel estimates. \n \nB. Interpolation methods \n1) MMSE interpolation: The estimates of channel \ncoefficients over pilot subcarriers can be arranged in the \nvector as  \npeqH ,\u02c6 [ ]Tppeqpeq NHHH )1(\u02c6),...1(\u02c6),0(\u02c6 ,, \u2212=  (9) \nwhere Np is the number of pilot signals in one MC-CDMA symbol. \nThen the MMSE interpolation is constructed as \npeqpphppeqpphpeq HSNRRRHRRH ,\n1\n,\n1\n\u02c6\n\u02c6)\/1(\u02c6\u02c6 \u2212\u2212 +==  (10) \nwhere hpR  denotes the covariance matrix between channel \ncoefficients at data subcarriers and those at pilot subcarriers. \nppR \u02c6\u02c6  denotes covariance matrix between channel coefficients \nat pilot subcarriers and their estimates.

But some channel \nstatistics must be known at the receiver side to calculate the \ncovariance matrices, such as the power delay profile of the \nchannel and the relative velocity between the mobile \nterminals and the base station.  \n \n2) FFT-based time domain interpolation: The insertion of pilots \nin frequency domain should satisfy the sampling theorem \nmax2\n1\n\u03c4s\nf f\nN \u2264  (11) \nwhere sf , max\u03c4 are the subcarrier bandwidth and the maximum \ndelay spread of the channel. Assuming the channel impulse \nresponse (CIR) is integer-sample spaced, it is easy to show \nthat the number of taps of CIR is always less then Np if (11) is \nsatisfied. Therefore the estimates of the CIR can be achieved \nby applying Np- point IFFT of pilot estimates \n\u2211\u2212\n=\n\u2212\u2264\u2264\u22c5=\n1\n0\n\/2\n, 10,)(\u02c6\n1)(\u02c6\np\np\nN\ni\np\nNiqj\npeq\np\nNqeiH\nN\nqh \u03c0  (12) \nBy padding N-Np zero samples in sequence )}(\u02c6{ qh , the \nestimates of channel coefficients over all subcarriers can be \ngot by applying N-point FFT \n10,)(\u02c6)(\u02c6\n1\n0\n\/2\n\u2212\u2264\u2264\u22c5=\u2211\u2212\n=\n\u2212 NieqhiH\nN\nq\nNiqj\neq\n\u03c0  (13) \nTo achieve the better performance, some time domain \nprocessing are always applied for this kind of channel \nestimator such as windowing or selecting the most significant \ntaps, which are not focused in our discussion.   \n \nC. Sensitivity to synchronization errors \nEffects of synchronization errors on the channel estimation are \nevaluated in simulation. Fig. 3 shows the BER performance of the \nchannel estimation algorithms with timing offset of Dt samples. Dt \n\u2264 -1 denotes that the offset is to the left, which means the timing \noffset is within the guard interval. It is observed that MMSE \ninterpolation is very sensitive to the leftward offset, while FFT-\nbased interpolation has some ability to compensate it. On the other \nhand, FFT-based interpolation is more sensitive to the rightward \noffset. That is because the linear phase modulated in frequency \ndomain corresponds to a position shift of the CIR in time domain. \nFor MMSE interpolation, it brings additional channel model \nmismatch. For FFT-based time domain interpolation, there are two \ndifferent cases. When Dt \u2264 -1, the position of the CIR will rotate to \nthe right by Dt samples. If the rotation is smaller than the \ndifference between Np and the number of taps of the CIR, it will be \ncompletely identified by (12) and recovered in frequency domain \nby (13). However when Dt \u2265 1, the position of the CIR will rotate \nto the left by Dt samples. Then the first several taps will rotate to \nthe right end of the )}(\u02c6{ qh  sequence. After padding zeros, the \nestimated CIR will be completely different with the actual ones, \nwhich cannot be recovered. Fig. 4 demonstrates the performance \nof channel estimators with frequency offset of De normalized \nfrequency offset. There observes a large performance loss when \nonly a fractional offset presents, because the frequency offset \nintroduces the additive interference term and greatly degrades the \naccuracy of pilot channel estimates, which cannot be compensated \nin the interpolation phase.  \n \nIV. SYNCHRONIZATION ERROR COMPENSATION METHODS \nA. Compensation of timing offset \n    Typical timing offset estimation methods in multicarrier \nsystems exploit auto-correlation in time domain based on the \nperiodic nature of the received signal, either generated by the \ncyclic prefix or by the training symbols. Correlation \nalgorithms are not effective when the offset is within the \ndifference between the guard interval and the CIR. Channel \nestimation methods are sensitive to this kind of offset because \nit causes the additional model mismatch in interpolation. \nTherefore, the residual timing offset needs to be identified \nand compensated before interpolation. If (11) is satisfied, the \nfrequency spacing of pilots will be smaller than the coherence \nbandwidth of channel, and there is \n)1()( ,, +\u2248 kHkH peqpeq  (14) \nAnd )}(\u02c6{ , kH peq  can be considered as a sequence with a single \nfrequency and the phase error can be estimated by \n\u2211\u2212\n=\n+\n\u2212\n\u2220==\n2\n0\n,\n*\n, )1(\u02c6)(\u02c6)1(\n1\/\u02c62\u02c6\npN\nk\npeqpeq\nfp\nkHkH\nNN\nN\u03c4\u03c0\u03b8\u03c4   (15) \nAnd channel estimates over pilot subcarriers can be \ncompensated by multiplying the single frequency \nijN\npeqpeq\nfeiHiH \u03c4\u03b8\u02c6,, )(\u02c6)(\n~\n\u2212\n\u22c5=  (16) \nAfter the compensation, the channel model mismatch is \nconsiderably reduced, and the interpolation algorithms can be \napplied.

In \nmulticarrier systems, subcarriers are generally not full-loaded \nin order to avoid aliasing and ease the transmit filtering. In \nthis case, some null subcarriers are placed at the edge of the \nfrequency band. After OFDM demodulation, the received \nsignal at the null subcarriers is (according to (6)) \n)()()( , iWiIiS uuiciu +=  (18) \nwhere )(iSu  is completely dependent on the interference and \nnoise power. The measure function is then defined by \n2\nuSM =  (19) \nwhere \nuS  is the vector of the received signals over all null \nsubcarriers. In our scheme, the frequency offset is pre-\ncompensated in time domain before OFDM demodulation by \nmultiplying Nnj ie \/2\u03c0\u03b5 , where i\u03b5  is the compensation factor in \nthe ith iteration. During the iteration, i\u03b5  is increased from \nzero to a positive designed value by a fractional step of n\u03b5 , \nand the value of measure function M is calculated every time. \nThe final estimation \u03b5\u02c6  is achieved by minimizing M. The \nperformances of these methods are evaluated in simulation in \nthe following section. \n \nV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS \nThe parameters of the broadband downlink MC-CDMA system \nin simulation are summarized in Table 1. We only consider the \ncase of one active user. Because in downlink transmission all users \nare synchronous and pilot symbols are allocated in the unique \ntime-frequency grid, there is no inter-user interference in the \nchannel estimation phase. Simulation for multiuser case can get \nthe similar result which is not outlined here. A 17-tap ourdoor \nmobile channel [12] is implemented.  The length of the cyclic \nprefix (guard interval) is larger than the CIR of channel by 116 \nsamples. The performances of data-aided channel estimators are \nevaluated with the time and frequency synchronization errors. Fig. \n3 and Fig. 4 show the performance of the channel estimators \nwithout compensating the synchronization errors, which have \nbeen discussed in the previous section. Fig. 5 demonstrates the \nperformance of the compensated channel estimators with timing \noffset Dt. Dt is set to \u201340 and 5 respectively for MMSE \ninterpolation and FFT-based interpolation. It shows that the \nproposed method considerably compensates the effect of the \ntiming offset, and the BER curves are very close to the \nperformance with ideal time synchronization. There is some \nperformance loss for the FFT-based algorithm, because the timing \noffset to the right induces the inter-symbol interference, which \ncannot be corrected by frequency domain approach. Considering \nthe tolerance of the guard interval, the rightward offset unlikely \noccurs in actual case. Fig. 6 shows the performance of the \ncompensated channel estimator with the constant frequency offset. \nIt achieves satisfactory performance for all channel estimators. \nFinally, an overall performance of our method with time and \nfrequency synchronization errors is showed in Fig. 7, and \ncompared with that of ideal synchronization and channel \nestimation.  \nIn this paper, we studied the effects of the residual timing and \nfrequency offset on the different data-aided channel estimators. \nLow complexity methods for compensation synchronization errors \nare proposed without applying any additional training.  \nSimulations show that it considerably improves the performance \nof channel estimators in imperfect synchronization conditions. The \nuplink case, where users are quasi-synchronous or asynchronous \nbetween each other, is of interests for the further research.  \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nEb\/No (dB)\nBE\nR\nMMSE, Dt=0\nMMSE, Dt=\u221240\nMMSE, Dt=5\nFFT, Dt=0\nFFT, Dt=\u221240\nFFT, Dt=5\n \nFigure 3.
