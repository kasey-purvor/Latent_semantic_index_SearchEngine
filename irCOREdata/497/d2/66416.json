Their magnetoresistive prop-\nerties have been exploited in the fields of magnetic read\nheads and magnetic memory storage.1,2 Use of a wide variety\nof characterization techniques, such as high-resolution trans-\nmission electron microscopy as well as x-ray and neutron\nscattering, have resulted in significant progress in correlating\nstructure with transport properties, thereby improving the ef-\nficiency of such devices. However, in order to understand\ncompletely the magnetotransport properties of spin valves\nand magnetic multilayers, a full description and thus charac-\nterization of the magnetic structure is required. The giant\nmagnetoresistance properties resulting from spin-dependent\nscattering is often hypothesized to occur at the interface. The\nrole of the chemical interface is now becoming better under-\nstood, but the magnetic interface is also a key component in\nunderstanding both spin accumulation and electron scatter-\ning.\nInitial characterization techniques concentrated on the\nchemical structure, with particular emphasis being placed on\nthe role of the interface morphology with respect to the\ntransport. Modeling the distribution of scattered intensity of\neither neutrons or x-rays around the origin of reciprocal\nspace allows the chemical interface morphology to be de-\nduced, and to be separated from interdiffusion effects.3 The\nhigh flux of synchrotron sources has greatly advanced diffuse\nx-ray scattering studies, and both experimental ideas and the-\noretical concepts are well developed. Although x-ray scatter-\ning has proved to be immensely beneficial in elucidating\nstructural parameters, the technique has little sensitivity to\nthe magnetization profile. Away from resonance, the mag-\nnetic contribution is many orders of magnitude weaker than\nthe Thompson charge scattering. In the past, the character-\nization of the magnetic structure has been confined to polar-\nized neutron reflectometry.4 This technique probes the atomic\nmoment directly, with the neutron\u2013spin interaction being\nwell understood. Advances in detector design and increases\nin source flux have enabled off-specular and other diffuse\nneutron studies to be performed routinely.\nHowever, recent synchrotron experiments,5,6 in which\nthe incident x-ray energy is tuned close to an atomic transi-\ntion, directly probe the magnetic band structure and provide\na magnetic scattering amplitude comparable to that of the\ncharge scatter. For transition metals, it is the empty states in\nthe 3d band that give rise to the magnetization, thus experi-\nments need to be conducted at the LIII and LII edges, which\nfor cobalt are at 778.1 and 793.2 eV, respectively.7 This pro-\nvides an alternative magnetic characterization technique that\nhas the advantage of high synchrotron flux, coupled with\nelement specificity. However, since the interaction between\nthe photon and the magnetic moment is indirect, it cannot be\nseparated uniquely from the charge scattering.\nMultilayers of Co\/Cu and Co\/Ru were prepared by mag-\nnetron sputtering in a system with a base pressure better than\n1028 Torr. The thickness of the spacer layer was adjusted to\ncorrespond to the second antiferromagnetic ~AF! coupling\nmaxima. The samples were deposited on Si ~001! substrates\nwithout removal of the native oxide. The interlayer exchange\ncoupling in the Co\/Ru system is significantly greater than\nthat in the Co\/Cu case.a!Electronic mail: s.langridge@rl.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS VOLUME 93, NUMBER 10 15 MAY 2003\n65100021-8979\/2003\/93(10)\/6510\/3\/$20.00 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

Two-dimensional maps in reciprocal space\nwere recorded using a one-dimensional detector and neutrons\nwith wavelengths in the range 1.2\u20136.5 \u00c5.\nResonant magnetic x-ray scattering was recorded on\nbeamline 5U1 at the SRS, Daresbury Laboratory. The sample\nwas mounted in an in-vacuum, two-circle diffractometer.\nSpecular and diffuse scatter were recorded in the conven-\ntional manner using linearly polarized x-rays. Experiments\nwere conducted at remanence, but prior to sample alignment\nthey were saturated ex situ by the application of a 140 mT\nfield along the hard or easy axis.\nFigure 1 shows the neutron data recorded at remanence\nfor a sample with nominal structure Co~20 \u00c5!\/Cu~22 \u00c5!. The\nBragg peak associated with the repeat structure occurs at an\nout-of-plane momentum transfer of qz50.155 \u00c521. No dif-\nfuse intensity associated with the structural interfaces could\nbe observed, and the apparent broadening at the structural\nBragg peak is resolution limited. However, this is not the\ncase at the magnetic Bragg peak, centered on qz\n50.075 \u00c521 where a broad peak in both qx and qz can be\nseen.\nThe width of the peak in qz was used to estimate the\nextent of the out-of-plane correlation of the magnetic inter-\nfaces. We observed clear differences between Co\/Cu and\nCo\/Ru multilayers.8 For the Cu system, the magnetic and\nstructural out-of-plane correlation lengths were approxi-\nmately 600 \u00c5. In the Ru system, the structural correlation\nlength was similar, but that associated with the magnetic dis-\norder was larger and approached 2000 \u00c5, the total thickness\nof the film.\nResonant magnetic scattering was performed on samples\ndeposited in the same growth run as those used in the neu-\ntron experiments. Longitudinal diffuse scans that probe the\ndiffuse scatter as a function of qz were measured from\nsamples from both the Cu and Ru systems. In addition to\nthose samples deposited with spacer layers corresponding to\nthe second. AF coupling maximum, we also measured those\ngrown at the first AF peak.\nUnlike the neutron data, the x-ray scans showed strong\ndiffuse intensity at both the charge and magnetic Bragg\npeaks ~Fig. 2!. On application of a saturating field, the mag-\nnetic peaks disappeared. The peaks were fitted to Lorentz-\nians, and we find that for all samples, the out-of-plane cor-\nrelation length for the structural roughness was similar, and\nin the range from 200 to 250620 \u00c5. We have defined the\nout-of-plane correlation length as being equal to the inverse\nof the half width at half maximum of the peak in qz , which\ncorresponds to the length scale at which the out-of-plane\ncorrelation has reduced to a value of 1\/e . The greater signal-\nto-noise ratio in the x-ray data, compared to the neutron data,\nenabled this more explicit formulism to be used. The width\nof the magnetic peak varied; in the Ru system the associated\nmagnetic correlation length was always greater than the\nstructural correlation length, the effect being greater for\nsamples prepared at the first AF coupling peak, the ratio of\nmagnetic to structural being 1.4. In the Cu system, the ratio\nfor samples grown with Cu59 \u00c5, corresponding to the first\nAF peak, was 1. Samples prepared at the second coupling\nmaximum had much broader magnetic peaks ~Fig. 2!, giving\na out-of-plane magnetic correlation length of only 90\n615 \u00c5 and a ratio of 0.4. This length scale was not depen-\ndent on magnetization direction. We note that there is a trend\ntowards higher exchange coupling, resulting in larger out-of-\nplane coherence of the magnetic disorder.\nThe distribution of the neutron data along the in-plane\ndirection qx has been modeled assuming a Gaussian distri-\nbution of domains, characterized by an in-plane domain cor-\nrelation function given by:\nC~R !5sm\n2 expS 2 RjmD . ~1!\nHere, sm is the magnitude of the magnetic domain dis-\norder and jm is the lateral correlation length, defined as the\nlength scale of the magnetic disorder.9 Equation ~1! is a spe\ncial case of the general correlation function introduced by\nSinha et al. used to model the charge interface, with the frac-\ntal parameter h set to 0.5.10 Line scans were extracted at the\nmagnetic Bragg peak and the in-plane correlation length\nfound to be 15 00064000 \u00c5.8 This value is significantly less\nFIG. 1.

Figure\n3 shows such transverse scans taken through the magnetic\nBragg peak for both magnetization directions.\nThe data could be fitted to a Lorentzian line shape that\ncorresponds to the Fourier transform of the correlation func-\ntion given in Eq. ~1!. We note that the higher flux and ex-\ntended q range of the synchrotron experiments enables the\ndata to be recorded over a wider intensity range than that\npossible in the comparable neutron case. The Lorentzian line\nshape found here confirms the correlation function that was\nused to fit the neutron data, and that the magnetic disorder\ncan be described with a scaling, or fractal parameter of 0.5.\nIn the special case of h50.5, the full width at half maximum\nof the diffuse peak in reciprocal space is simply 2\/jm .11 Af-\nter magnetization along the hard axis, the in-plane correla-\ntion length was 880620 \u00c5, compared to the much larger\n70006100 \u00c5 length scale observed after magnetization\nalong the easy axis. Both length scales are much smaller than\nthe largest resolvable length scale, which is of the order of 5\nmm.\nAs expected, no change was observed in the transverse\nscans taken through the structural Bragg peak upon field ap-\nplication. The peak shape, similar to the magnetic Bragg\npeak, corresponded to a correlation length of 48 \u00c5. We note\nthat, as was the case in our previous study on Cu\/Co multi-\nlayers grown at the first AF coupling maximum, the length\nscale of the structural roughness is substantially shorter than\nthat defining the magnetic interface.7\nThe resonant x-ray and neutron off-specular data show\nremarkably good agreement, however, the specular data are\nless consistent. Figure 4 shows the specular and longitudinal\ndiffuse scans from a 20-period Co\/Ru multilayer grown at\nthe second AF coupling peak. The quality of the sample is\nhigh, with structural Bragg peaks being seen in the specular\ndata out to many orders. Neutron data on similar samples\nshow clear magnetic and structural Bragg peaks, but in the\nx-ray data the specular magnetic peaks cannot be seen, it is\nonly in the diffuse scan that the magnetic peaks appear. Their\nmagnetic origin is confirmed by their field sensitivity and\nenergy resonance. The variation in the AF peaks with direc-\ntion of magnetization is consistent with the predominant sen-\nsitivity of x-ray scattering to the component of magnetization\nin the scattering plane.12\nWe have successfully applied two different scattering\nmechanisms to the study of magnetic disorder in multilayer\nsystems. The agreement in the off-specular data is extremely\ngood for the Co\/Cu system, but we find in the Co\/Ru system\nthat the two techniques do not give comparable results. The\ndifference in sensitivity could arise from the different inter-\naction potentials of the two probes, one being primarily sen-\nsitive to the point-like nuclei, and the other interacting with\nthe electron density profile. However, the high flux of the\nx-ray source does allow for rapid determination of the\nelement-specific interface morphological parameters, but\nhow these data relate to the better-understood neutron inter-\nactions remains unclear.\nThe authors are indebted to S.
