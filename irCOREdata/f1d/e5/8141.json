The dynamics and\nstability of these vortices are particularly important in areas of fluid dynamics\nsuch as meteorology [5, 6] and MHD [7]. Many studies have considered the be-\nhaviour of an axisymmetric vortex subjected to a transient, non\u2013axisymmetric\nstrain. If this strain is weak then in the early stages the vortex may evolve\ndynamically into an axisymmetric state; any non\u2013axisymmetric components\nof the vorticity become finely scaled through spiral wind\u2013up in the underlying\nflow field [8]. During this process the far\u2013field form of the stream function\ndecays exponentially in time and rotates with a fixed angular velocity which\nis fast compared to the decay rate. This behaviour of the vortex is termed a\nquasi\u2013mode [9, 10, 11] and has been observed both in plasma experiments [10]\n(where the governing equations are isomorphic to the Euler equations) and in\nnumerical studies [12].\nPut simply, a quasi-mode is essentially a wave located in the core of a vortex\nand, while it appears to be a single mode, it can more accurately be charac-\nterised as a wave-packet of continuum modes. The quasi\u2013mode is a solution of\nthe linearised Euler equations that is not separable in time, and decays on a\nmuch longer time-scale than the turn-over time-scale of the underlying vortex.\nQuasi\u2013modes of an axisymmetric circular vortex have been studied analyti-\ncally via Laplace transforms of the linearised Euler equation [9, 10, 13]; an\nattraction of this method is that the angular velocity and the decay rate of\nthe disturbance stream function can be deduced from the real and imaginary\nparts of a simple pole of the governing system. The location of this pole, known\nas a Landau pole, can be calculated by analytic continuation techniques [9]\nand it follows that the decay rate and angular velocity of the quasi\u2013mode\ndepend only on the form of the axisymmetric base profile of the vortex. More-\nover, the decay rate of the quasi\u2013mode is very sensitive to the gradient of the\naxisymmetric base profile at the critical radius where the angular velocity of\nthe quasi\u2013mode equals that of the vortex [11].\nAn illustration of an azimuthal wave number n = 2 disturbance to a Gaussian\nvortex is shown in figure 1. At the earlier time (figure 1(a)) there is a linear\ncombination of a spiral structure in which vorticity depends on r and \u03b8, and\na mode in which the sign of the vorticity depends just on \u03b8: this is the quasi-\nmode, and corresponds to an elliptical distortion of the whole vortex that\nrotates (much like a Kelvin mode on a top-hat vortex) and decays because\nof interaction with spiral wind-up of fluctuations at the critical radius where\nthe fluid co-rotates with the mode. At the later time (figure 1(b)) the quasi-\nmode has decayed to low levels, leaving behind the spiral structure, in which\nvorticity is of fine scale and essentially passive.\n2\n(a) x\ny\n\u22126\n\u22126 6\n6\n(b) x\ny\n\u22126 6\n\u22126\n6\nFig. 1. An n = 2 disturbance to a Gaussian vortex at (a) t = 200 and (b) t = 1000.\nThe scale is white\/black where the vorticity is greater\/less than 0.5 times the max-\nimum\/minimum vorticity.\nWhen an axisymmetric vortex is placed within a sufficiently strong irrotational\nstrain field, it is well\u2013known that the vorticity can evolve into a tripole in which\na pair of cat\u2019s eyes rotate around a coherent vortex core [10, 11, 14, 15]. The\nvorticity within the cat\u2019s eyes becomes wound up and homogenized; moreover\nif cat\u2019s eyes persist (i.e. the far\u2013field stream function neither grows nor decays)\nthen they can be associated with a neutral mode of the mean vortex profile.\nOn the other hand, if they are not maintained, decay occurs at a rate which\ncorresponds to a Landau pole [15]. Numerical simulations of the Navier\u2013Stokes\nequations by Turner & Gilbert [15] show how finite thickness cat\u2019s eyes can\nbe generated by forcing an axisymmetric vortex with a rotating strain field.\nWhen the strain field is switched on, cat\u2019s eyes form around the radius where\nthe angular velocity of the vortex equals that of the strain field. If the strain\nfield is of high amplitude or left on for a long duration, then when it is turned\noff, cat\u2019s eyes may persist at a radius whose position depends upon how the\nperturbation vorticity feeds back to change the axisymmetric basic profile\n[15]. In contrast, some earlier studies [16] have indicated that when cat\u2019s eyes\ngenerated on a Gaussian vortex are vanishingly thin, they are localised at a\nsingle specific radius. The full simulations [15] could not access this limit of\ninfinitesimal thickness, as unfeasibly long runs at very small amplitudes and\nvery high Reynolds numbers would have been required.\nThe purpose of the current work is to ascertain whether finite thickness cat\u2019s\neyes on a Gaussian vortex can be maintained at many radii or whether they are\nrestricted to a single specific radius. Can these cat\u2019s eye structures superim-\nposed on the vortex be long\u2013lived and, if so, what are the key properties of the\nunderlying axisymmetric profile which enable it to support a neutral mode?\nWe shall examine these issues by calculating the Landau poles of a model ax-\nisymmetric profile with a small flattened region or \u2018defect\u2019. Our chosen profile\n3\n(detailed in (18) below) comprises a standard Gaussian form supplemented by\na three-parameter family of distributions; in essence the three parameters con-\ntrol the amplitude, thickness and location of the defect. This form of vorticity\ndistribution is quite typical of the azimuthal average of a vortex which can\nsustain a cat\u2019s eyes structure through vorticity homogenization in the eyes.\nThe present paper is laid out in the following way. In \u00a72 we formulate the\nLandau pole problem and then in \u00a73 describe how the poles move in the com-\nplex plane as the three parameters of the defect are varied. The Landau poles\nare tracked by solving a suitable eigenvalue problem formulated in Laplace\ntransform space. The results obtained suggest that a profile with a thin ho-\nmogenized layer of vorticity can support a neutral mode and, in the limit of a\nvanishingly thin layer, the position of the neutral mode is as predicted by the\nasymptotic work of Le Dize`s [16]. We also examine the large\u2013time behaviour\nof the far\u2013field stream function and achieve this by solving the linearised Euler\nequation using a Keller box method [17]. Some concluding remarks are made\nin \u00a74.\n2 Formulation of the Landau pole problem\nWe consider a vortex governed by the two\u2013dimensional, incompressible Euler\nequations in standard plane polar coordinates (r, \u03b8),\n\u2202t\u2126\u2212 r\u22121(\u2202r\u03a8\u2202\u03b8\u2126\u2212 \u2202\u03b8\u03a8\u2202r\u2126) = 0, (1)\n\u22072\u03a8 = \u2212\u2126,\n(\n\u22072 \u2261 \u22022r + r\u22121\u2202r + r\u22122\u22022\u03b8\n)\n. (2)\nIn this system \u2126(r, \u03b8, t) denotes the vorticity and \u03a8(r, \u03b8, t) is the corresponding\nstream function which can found by inverting (2) and is permitted to grow no\nfaster than ln r for large r.\nWe decompose the vorticity and stream function distributions into an axisym-\nmetric part and a weak non\u2013axisymmetric perturbation,\n\u2126 = \u21260(r) + \u000f\u02c6\u03c9n(r, t)e\nin\u03b8 + c.c.+O(\u000f\u02c62), (3)\n\u03a8 = \u03a80(r) + \u000f\u02c6\u03c8n(r, t)e\nin\u03b8 + c.c.+O(\u000f\u02c62); (4)\nhere the azimuthal modenumber n \u2265 1, \u000f\u02c6 \u001c 1 and c.c. denotes the complex\nconjugate. In this limit (1) and (2) reduce to the linearized Euler equations\nfor the perturbation quantities,\n\u2202t\u03c9n + in\u03b1(r)\u03c9n + in\u03b2(r)\u03c8n = 0, (5)\n4\u03c8n = \u2212\u03c9n, (4\u2261 \u22022r + r\u22121\u2202r \u2212 r\u22122n2). (6)\n4\nThe angular velocity \u03b1(r) and the quantity \u03b2(r) are given by\n\u03b1(r) = \u2212r\u22121\u2202r\u03a80, \u03b2(r) = r\u22121\u2202r\u21260, (7)\nwhere the axisymmetric quantities are coupled via \u21260 = \u2212r\u22121\u2202r(r\u2202r\u03a80).\nThe properties of Laplace transforms of (5) have been studied in depth by\nBriggs et al. [9] and Schecter et al. [10] so we only highlight the main points\nhere. (Further details can be obtained from those papers and [15].) The quan-\ntity n which appears in the above equations identifies the particular Fourier\nmode under investigation; notice that n = 1 is a special case of a pure transla-\ntion, which gives no dynamical effects; hence it is of no interest here [18, 19].\nWe shall take n = 2 in all our subsequent calculations for two main reasons.\nFirst, and conveniently, this mode is next sequentially in a general multipole\nexpansion after the n = 1 mode. On more physically significant grounds, the\nmultipole expansion of a single vortex in a large scale flow will be dominated\nby the n = 2 component in the presence of long distance interactions with\nother vortices; for general n the effect of one vortex on another falls off \u221d R\u2212n\nwhere R is their separation so that the largest dynamical effect corresponds\nto n = 2. We would also expect qualitatively similar results to those described\nhere for the minority of flows for which the n = 2 mode is completely absent so\nthat the multipole moment with some other n > 2 dominates the dynamical\neffects internal to the vortex. Notice that although our calculations will be\nrestricted to the n = 2 case, we shall retain a general n in our formulation to\nillustrate the role of the mode number in the structure of the final equations.\nWe define the Laplace transform pair with respect to t by\nf\u00af(p) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\neiptf(t)dt, (8)\nf(t) =\u2212 1\n2pi\n\u222b \u2212\u221e+i\u03c3\n\u221e+i\u03c3\ne\u2212iptf\u00af(p)dp, (9)\nwith any real \u03c3 > 0. Combining equations (5) and (6) and taking the Laplace\ntransform with respect to t leads to an equation for \u03c8\u00afn(r, p) of the form[\n\u22022\n\u2202r2\n+\n1\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\u2212 n\n2\nr2\n+\nn\u03b2(r)\np\u2212 n\u03b1(r)\n]\n\u03c8\u00afn(r, p) = \u2212 i\u03c9n(r, 0)\np\u2212 n\u03b1(r) .

The dashed line\ngives the regime A decay rate \u03b3G = \u22120.0063 from a Landau pole calculation.\nare apparent. Regime A is the quasi\u2013mode period of exponential decay with\ndecay rate \u03b3G \u2248 \u22120.0063 and angular velocity \u03b1G \u2248 0.0089 calculated via\nLandau pole methods [15], while regimes B and C are related to the large\u2013r\nform of the vorticity and the remnant of the vorticity in the core respectively\n[12]. Schecter et al. [10] give the quasi\u2013mode decay rate as (0.226\u22120.079i)\u21260(0)\nwhere we have taken \u21260(0) = 1\/4pi. The minor difference between the angular\nvelocity values of Turner & Gilbert [15] and Schecter et al. [10] can be traced\nto the fact that the former was calculated using an infinite domain and the\nlater a large finite domain.\nThe multipole moment can be written in terms of the far\u2013field form of the\nstream function by\nQn(t) = lim\nr\u2192\u221e\n(\nnrn\u03c8n \u2212 rn+1\u2202r\u03c8n\n)\n,\n(see [12]). We impose the boundary condition \u03c8n = 0 at r = r0 where we will\ntake the limit r0 \u2192 \u221e so as to simulate the evolution of a disturbance in an\ninfinite domain.\nEquation (10) is solved by means of the appropriate Green\u2019s function [9, 13]\nwhich leads to the Laplace transform of the quantity Qn(t) expressed as\nQ\u00afn(p) = \u2212 ir\nn+1\n\u03a8L(r, p)\n\u222b r\n0\ns\u03a8L(s, p)\u03c9n(s, 0)\nr(n\u03b1(s)\u2212 p) ds\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nr=r0\n, (12)\nwhere the function \u03a8L(r, p) satisfies the homogeneous form of (10),[\n\u22022\n\u2202r2\n+\n1\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\u2212 n\n2\nr2\n+\nn\u03b2(r)\np\u2212 n\u03b1(r)\n]\n\u03a8L(r, p) = 0, (13)\nsubject to the condition \u03a8L(0, p) = 0.\n6\nIt is clear that (13) potentially has a singularity at the point rs where \u03b1(rs) =\np\/n. If the axisymmetric vorticity profile \u21260(r) is a smooth decreasing function\nand if \u03b2(rs) vanishes, then it can be shown that there is a neutral mode of\nthe vortex [9]. Conversely, if \u03b2(rs) 6= 0 and \u21260(r) is monotonically decreasing\non the whole domain r \u2208 [0, r0] then there are no discrete eigenmodes of the\nvortex [9]. In the first case the function Q\u00afn(p) possesses a simple pole, which\non inverting the Laplace transform, gives rise to an exponential term in Qn(t).\nIn the second case however, we have no simple poles of Q\u00afn(p) and hence no\nexponential terms in Qn(t). All the behaviour of Qn(t) is contained in the\nbranch cut along the real-p axis in the range n\u03b1(r0) \u2264 p \u2264 n\u03b1(0). Analytical\ncontinuation techniques enable this branch cut to be deformed below the real\np\u2013axis by moving the radial contour of integration in (12) above the real r\u2013\naxis. If the branch cut is bent sufficiently then one or more so-called Landau\npoles pj (j = 1, 2, 3, ....) appear in the analytical continuation of Q\u00afn(p) (the\nnumber of poles that are seen depends both on how far the contour is deformed\nand the exact form of \u21260(r)). When the inversion contour is deformed around\na pole and the branch cut, this leads to a term in Qn(t) of the form e\n\u2212ipjt;\nalthough such a term can dominate the early evolution of Qn(t) it does not\ncorrespond to a normal mode. This Landau pole identifies a complex decay rate\n\u2212ipj = \u03b3Q\u2212in\u03b1Q where \u03b3Q < 0 and \u03b1Q are the decay rate and angular velocity\nrespectively. When there are N Landau poles in the analytical continuation\nof Q\u00afn(p), then Qn(t) takes the form\nQn(t) =\nN\u2211\nj=1\nfje\n\u2212ipjt + a branch cut contribution, (14)\nwhere the constants fj depend on the initial conditions. The angular velocity\n\u03b1Q of each quasi\u2013mode identifies a corresponding critical radius rQ at which\nthe fluid particles co\u2013rotate. This radius is found by solving\n\u03b1(rQ) = \u03b1Q, (15)\nwhere we have used (7) to write \u03b1(r) as\n\u03b1(r) =\n1\nr2\n\u222b r\n0\ns\u21260(s)ds.\nFor a pure Gaussian vortex \u03b1G \u2248 0.0089 which gives rG \u2248 4.22. With the\nvortex profiles we consider in this study, small \u03b1Q corresponds to a large\ncritical radius rQ, while if \u03b1Q \u2248 \u03b1(0) then rQ \u2248 0. With a linear combination of\ncontributions such as in (14) it is not clear just how Qn(t) might behave during\nits early evolution, as the relative values of the quantities fj are important.\nNevertheless, after a sufficiently long initial transient, it will be the Landau\npole with smallest decay rate that will eventually dominate.\nTo calculate the positions of the Landau poles we used contours in the complex\n7\n(a)\n 0\n 0.3\n 0.6\n 0.9\n 1.2\n 1.5\n 0  3  6  9  12  15\nRe(r)\nIm(r)\n(b)\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n 0\n 0  0.02  0.04  0.06  0.08\nIm(p)\nFig. 3.

As s moves from 0 to 1 so the corresponding\nr-path joins zero to (real) infinity and a typical form of the contour is sketched\nin figure 3(a).\nEquation (13) is integrated from s = s\u02dc \u001c 1 to s = 1 along (16) using a\nRunge\u2013Kutta method. As r \u2192 0 it is known that \u03a8L(r, p) \u223c rn and so we\nimpose the initial conditions\n\u03a8L(r(s\u02dc), p) = r\nn(s\u02dc),\n\u2202\u03a8L\n\u2202s\n= nr\u2032(s\u02dc)rn\u22121(s\u02dc), (17)\nat s = s\u02dc\u001c 1. Of course, in general \u03a8L 6= 0 at s = 1 and so Newton iteration\non the eigenvalue p is used to ensure that \u03a8L vanishes at this endpoint. An\nalternative strategy for solving (13) subject to homogeneous boundary con-\nditions relies on a global eigenvalue method [20], which generates a discrete\napproximation to the continuous spectrum as well as finding any poles around\nwhich the inversion contour has to be deformed. The global method is used to\ngive an initial starting value to the eigenvalue p for the iterative local method,\nwhich is generally the more accurate. An example of the global solution to (13)\nis shown in figure 3(b) which illustrates the continuous spectrum together with\nfour Landau poles.\nBearing in mind our objective to investigate when cat\u2019s eyes structure might be\nrelatively long-lived, we consider the three-parameter family of axisymmetric\nprofiles given by\n8\n 0.06\n 0.04\n 0.02\n 5 4 3 2 1 0\nr\n\u21260\nFig. 4.

(18)\nHere \u03b4, \u000f and rc denote the amplitude, thickness and radius of the defect\nrespectively. Some sample profiles are shown in figure 4 which illustrates the\ndifferent forms of \u21260(r) as the three parameters are varied. The form of (18)\nis that of a Gaussian vortex which has been flattened-off in the vicinity of\nthe critical rc; as mentioned earlier this type of profile is characteristic of\nthose for which cat\u2019s eyes are observed. The parameter \u03b4 is a measure of the\ndegree of flattening imposed; clearly when \u03b4 = 0 the Gaussian is unaltered\nand at the other extreme \u03b4 = 1, there is a turning point and an inflexion\npoint at r = rc (\u2126\n\u2032\n0(rc) = \u2126\n\u2032\u2032\n0(rc) = 0) which we shall refer to as a \u2018flat\nregion\u2019 for brevity. This zone can be thought of as the azimuthal average of\na vortex which has cat\u2019s eyes at a radius rc of thickness \u000f, which have been\nformed through some nonlinear mechanism. However, vortices containing cat\u2019s\neyes, which have been generated in fully nonlinear simulations, do not have a\nsmooth azimuthal profile [15] but, instead, typically contain a flattened region\nwith fine scale structure due to the nonlinear interactions. They also generally\nhave sharper vorticity gradients around the flattened region than are present\nin the idealised profile (18). Thus our model used here might be helpful for\nunderstanding the behaviours of thin cat\u2019s eyes, but nonlinear interactions\nneed to be considered for our results to be confirmed.\n9\n3 Results\nIn this section we describe results of the Landau pole calculations and the\nlinear code simulations for the profiles given by (18). We shall have frequent\ncause to refer to the real and imaginary parts of Landau poles pj and so it is to\nbe remembered that these quantities correspond to n multiples of the angular\nvelocity \u03b1Q and the decay rate \u03b3Q of the vortex quasi\u2013mode respectively.\n3.1 Landau pole calculations\nThe Landau pole calculations rely on the parameters \u03c11 and \u03c12 in (16) being\nchosen so that the corresponding contour of the continuous spectrum in the\np\u2013plane is bent sufficiently to reveal the poles we wish to follow. All the results\nhere used \u03c11 \u2208 [1.5, 5] and \u03c12 \u2208 [0.4, 2.2] with the particular values governed\nby the nature of the underlying vorticity \u21260(r). In the limits of small \u000f and\nextreme rc (either small or large) we found that it was not always possible\nto track all the poles of interest as the contour in the p\u2013plane often becomes\nvery knotted and intricate. Moreover the poles then become easily confused\nwith the continuous spectrum. That said however, we were able to capture the\nbehaviour of the poles sufficiently well to make some useful observations.\nWe have a three-dimensional parameter space (\u03b4, \u000f, rc) to investigate and for\nthe parameter ranges considered we generally found that the values of \u03c11\nand \u03c12 in (16) led to three Landau poles of interest in the p\u2013plane; the only\nexception occurs when \u03b4 = 1 when an extra pole appears. We explored our\nparameter space systematically by fixing the parameters two at a time and\nthen allowing the third to vary. Figure 5 plots the imaginary parts Im(p) = \u03b3Q\nof three Landau poles as the basic vorticity changes.\nFigure 5(a) relates to a defect of moderate thickness \u000f = 0.5 positioned at\nrc = 4 whose amplitude 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1. For \u03b4 = 0 we have a Gaussian profile,\nwhich has a Landau pole at pG = 0.0177\u2212 0.0063i, which corresponds to pole\n1. As \u03b4 is increased from zero, so poles 2 and 3 move in quickly from the\nlarge negative imaginary region of the p\u2013plane. One of the poles (pole 3) has\na larger decay rate than the other two for all the values of \u03b4 considered and\nhence is expected to be insignificant for the initial decay of the perturbation.\nPoles 1 and 2 have very similar decay rates for 0 < \u03b4 < 0.2, so it is unclear at\nwhich rate the vortex quasi-mode will decay in this region. As we approach\nthe case of a flat region at r = rc in \u21260(r) (i.e. the amplitude of the defect\n\u03b4 = 1) then we find that the original Gaussian quasi\u2013mode Landau pole (pole\n1) again has the smallest decay rate, and hence should dominate the initial\ndecay of the perturbation.\n10\n(a)\n-0.01\n-0.005\n 0\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1\n\u03b4\nIm(p)\n1\n2\n3\n(b)\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n 0\n 0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1\n\u03b5\nIm(p)\n1\n2\n3\n(c)\n-0.015\n-0.01\n-0.005\n 2  3  4  5  6\n2\nIm(p)\n1\n3\nrc\nFig. 5.

The two Landau poles that\nhad similar decay rates in figure 5(a) continue to do so over the whole range\nof \u000f investigated. Pole 3 is again insignificant over most of the \u000f\u2013domain as\nit has a much larger decay rate than the other two, although, as \u000f becomes\nsmaller (i.e. as the defect thins) the presence of this third pole becomes more\nimportant.\nLastly, the defect in figure 5(c) has a fixed small amplitude \u03b4 = 0.1 and\nis of moderate thickness \u000f = 0.5 but is moved around by varying rc. Close\nto rc = 4 the two poles which were almost coincident in figure 5(a) remain\nnear to each other, and actually swap places. We would therefore expect the\ndecay rate of the perturbation to change between these two values with a\ncorresponding jump in frequency (cf. figure 10 later). Pole 3 again remains\ninsignificant for the values of rc considered here; however for large rc (i.e.\nwhen the defect is positioned well away from the vortex core) this pole tends\nto the Landau pole value for a Gaussian vortex noted earlier. As rc is moved\ntowards the origin, with \u000f still moderately large, the core of the vortex becomes\nincreasingly deformed and sharp gradients of vorticity form around the defect.\nConsequently results with rc < 1 and moderate \u000f need to be treated with care\nalthough if the thickness of the defect \u000f is reduced as rc moves towards the\n11\n(a)\n 0\n 0.02\n 0.04\n 0.06\n 0.08\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7\n1\nRe(p)\n2\n3\n4\nrc (b)\n-0.012\n-0.008\n-0.004\n 0\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7\n2\n3\n4\nIm(p)\nrc\n1\nFig. 6.

This is examined further in figure 6 which shows the real and\nimaginary parts of the significant Landau poles as functions of the defect\nposition rc for amplitude \u03b4 = 1 and thickness \u000f = 0.5. We see that there are\nnow four Landau poles which appear in the region of the p\u2013plane we consider.\nFigure 6(b) shows that poles 3 and 4 are not important in the evolution of the\nperturbation, as their decay rates are larger than the other two. When rc > 4.5\nthere are two poles close together, and so we expect these to combine together\nto affect the decay rate of perturbations to the vortex. For 1 < rc < 4.5 there\nis just one pole that dominates the decay of the vortex perturbation and it\nis this pole on which we concentrate now. This pole is significant because at\nrc \u2248 2.6 the vortex has a decay rate of only \u03b3Q \u2248 \u22126.4 \u00d7 10\u22125, and so at\nthis location the vortex perturbation will decay extremely slowly. Indeed, this\ndecay is so slow that it suggests that only tiny changes to the details of the\ndefect might be sufficient to ensure that \u03b3Q = 0 thereby forming a neutral\nmode.\nFigure 7 illustrates Im(p) = \u03b3Q for the Landau pole with the smallest decay\nrate, as a function of defect position rc, for \u03b4 = 1 and various values of \u000f. We\nsee that as the defect thickness \u000f decreases from \u000f = 0.5 (solid) the maximum\ngrowth rate value increases. However when \u000f = 0.3 (dotted) we see that there\nare now two maxima in the growth rate curve and these both have \u03b3Q = 0, i.e.\nthey are both neutral modes of the vortex. As \u000f is reduced further so both the\nneutral modes remain, but their positions separate. This suggests that cat\u2019s\neyes of a given finite thickness \u000f, which have an azimuthal average profile that\ncontains an annulus of homogenized vorticity, can persist at two distinct radii.\nAs \u000f \u2192 0 we expect to recover the result of Le Dize`s [16] who showed that\nvanishingly thin cat\u2019s eyes can only possess a neutral mode at the one radius\n12\n-0.0002\n-0.0001\n 0\n 1  1.5  2  2.5  3  3.5  4\nIm(p)\nrc\nFig. 7.

When \u000f . 0.35 there\nare two positions at which the maximum \u03b3Q occurs; at these points \u03b3Q is zero\nand so these correspond to neutral modes. Figure 8(b) shows the dependence\nof 2\u03b1Q = Re(p) where the minimum value of \u03b3Q occurs as a function of the\nthickness \u000f. The neutral mode which moves towards the origin (branch 2) has\nan angular velocity which increases as \u000f is reduced, and in the limit \u000f \u2192 0\nso \u03b1Q \u2192 1\/4pi. Le Dize\u00b4s [16] has shown that a vanishingly thin critical layer\ncannot exist at the origin, and we leave the issue of the limit \u000f \u2192 0 along\nbranch 2 as a topic for future study.

The solid horizontal\nline represents the line rQ = rc.\nposition and angular velocity of the branch 1 neutral mode tend to rc = 3.448\nand \u03b1Q = 0.0127 as \u000f \u2192 0. Both of these results agree with the results\nrLD = 3.44 and \u03b1LD = 0.0127 derived Le Dize`s [16] with errors of less than\n1%.\nAn explanation for the occurrence of the two neutral modes seen in figures 7\nand 8 is offered by figure 9. This shows the form of rQ \u2212 rc, found by solving\n(15), as a function of rc for \u03b4 = 1 and the five chosen defect thicknesses used in\nfigure 7. We see that when \u000f = 0.4 or 0.5 the critical radius rc always exceeds\nrQ. This implies that the critical radius of the quasi\u2013mode never occurs at\nthe flat centre of the defect in the profile; in other words the singular point\nrQ of (13) never occurs where \u03b2 = 0. On the other hand the curves for other\nthicknesses have rQ = rc twice at the two values of rc given in figure 8(a). Thus\nthe positions of the neutral modes correspond to points where the quasi\u2013mode\ncritical layer occurs exactly at the centre of the flat region of the profile, i.e.\nthe singular point of (13), r = rQ, is where \u03b2 = 0. As the thickness \u000f of the\nflat region is reduced from 0.5 (reading up the curves) we find that the peak\nof the growth rate curve moves towards the line rQ = rc and at \u000f \u2248 0.35 the\ncurve and line become tangent to one another and there is a single neutral\nmode of the vortex. For values of \u000f . 0.35, there are two neutral modes; one\nof these moves towards rc = 3.448 and the other approaches rc = 0 as the\ndefect thickness \u000f\u2192 0.\n3.2 Comparison with linear code\nNext we compare our Landau pole calculations with results determined by\nnumerically solving (5) using a Keller box [17] routine from the NAG suite;\n14\n(a)\n 0.01\n 0.02\n 0.03\n 0.04\n 2.5  3  3.5  4  4.5  5  5.5  6\nRe(p)\nrc (b)\n-0.003\n-0.002\n-0.001\n 0\n 2.5  3  3.5  4  4.5  5  5.5  6\nIm(p)\nrc\nFig. 10. Plot of (a) the real part and (b) the imaginary part of the growth rate\ncalculated via the linear code (dotted line) as a function of rc for \u03b4 = 1 and \u000f = 0.5.\nThe solid line and the large dashed line show the two Landau poles with largest\ngrowth rates in this region of interest. For rc . 5, the solid and dotted lines are\nindistinguishable.\nsee [12] for more details. The scheme imposes an external flow which instanta-\nneously distorts the vortex and then allows it to evolve freely over time. This\nproblem is of initial value type and so the decay rate and angular velocity mea-\nsured from the solution of (5) are time dependent. To estimate the values \u03b3Q\nand \u03b1Q we took the best linear fit of the data between two time values which\noccur just before the vortex leaves the linear decay part of its evolution (i.e.\njust before the vortex leaves regime A in a case such as figure 2). These times\nwere decided by a preliminary run of the code, from which we estimated the\ninstant t2 when the vortex changes regime. The earlier time was then taken to\nbe t1 = t2\u2212 1000, and then a re\u2013run of the code gave decay rates and angular\nvelocities that agree very well with the Landau pole theory.\nThe results outlined in \u00a73.1 show that in certain regions of our three\u2013dimensional\nparameter space one Landau pole dominates over the others, and hence we\nexpect the multipole moment Q2(t) to decay exponentially with a decay rate\nand angular velocity given by this Landau pole. However this is not com-\npletely obvious because this quasi\u2013mode decay is just a transient (see regime\nA in figure 2) and so there is only a finite time over which a decay rate can\nbe measured before the contribution from the branch cut takes over. Hence to\nassess at what rate the vortex perturbations actually decay in the early stages\nwe used the numerical scheme above to compare with our Landau pole results.\nFigure 10 shows results from the solution to the linear equations (5) and (6)\ntogether with the Landau poles corresponding to the smallest decay rates for\namplitude \u03b4 = 1 and thickness \u000f = 0.5 as in figure 6. Figure 10(a) demonstrates\nvery good agreement between the predictions of the linear code and the real\npart of the Landau pole with the larger of the two angular velocities, at least\nfor 2.5 < rc < 5. However, when the flat defect is centred at rc \u2248 5, a sudden\nchange in the angular velocity of the perturbation occurs and the linear code\n15\n-30\n-20\n-10\n 0\n 0  4000  8000  12000  16000\nt\nln|Q   |2\nFig. 11. Plot of ln |Q2| against time for the case \u03b4 = 1, \u000f = 0.5 and rc = 5.2. The\ndashed line is the growth rate given by the linear code and the dotted line is the\ngrowth rate give by the dominant Landau pole.\nresults correlate with the Landau pole with the smaller of the two angular\nvelocities once rc > 5. The reason for this frequency jump is suggested in\nfigure 10(b) which shows the imaginary part of the Landau pole (= \u03b3Q).\nThe linear code gives a growth rate that agrees with the Landau pole with\nsmallest decay rate for 2.5 < rc < 5; however at rc \u2248 5 another Landau pole\nacquires a smaller decay rate, and so the vortex perturbation switches onto\nthis new rate, with the corresponding angular velocity given by this pole (see\nfigure 10(a)). The reason the two methods are not in complete agreement for\nrc > 5 is because when the decay rates of these two Landau poles become\nclose, the vortex decays with a linear combination of the two decay rates and\nfrequencies and distinguishing between them is not particularly easy.\nFigure 11 considers the far\u2013field amplitude ln |Q2(t)| for a vorticity profile\nwith amplitude \u03b4 = 1, thickness \u000f = 0.5 and defect position rc = 5.2 (solid).\nThis value of rc lies close to the point where the two growth rate curves meet\nin figure 6(b). The two straight lines represent two decay rates: the first given\nby the best fit analysis of the linear code (dashed) and the second by the\ndominant Landau pole (dotted). We can see that due to the oscillations in\nln |Q2| a best fit line would depend on the time interval chosen in which to\ntake the approximation and because this initial exponential decay is only a\ntransient we can not integrate until one Landau pole clearly dominates the\nsolution; this is the reason for the small discrepancy between the results in\nfigure 10 once rc > 5. The decay rate given by the Landau pole in figure 11\n(dotted) is in good agreement with the decay rate of ln |Q2|, and hence the\nvortex perturbation really does diminish at the rate corresponding to that\nLandau pole with the slowest decay rate.\nThe Landau pole calculation in figure 7 of \u00a73.1 shows that for defect thicknesses\n16\n-6e-05\n-4e-05\n-2e-05\n 0\n 1  1.5  2  2.5  3  3.5\nIm(p)\nrc\nFig. 12.

Curves 2\u20135 all relate to\nthe case when \u03b4 = 1 and \u000f = 0.5 but with rc = 10, 9, 6 and 1 respectively.\n\u000f < 0.35 there are two positions rc where Im(p) = \u03b3Q = 0, and hence two radii\nwhich can support a neutral mode. We can confirm that a vortex does admit\nthese two neutral modes by using the linear code for the basic profile with\n\u03b4 = 1 and \u000f = 0.3. The outcome is illustrated in figure 12; it is concluded that\nthe linear code (dashed) and the Landau pole result (solid) are in excellent\nagreement, and the frequencies n\u03b1Q = Re(p) from the two calculations (not\nshown) turn out to be indistinguishable over this range of rc.\nFigure 13 plots ln |Re(Q2(t))| for the Gaussian vortex and four vorticity pro-\nfiles all with defect amplitude \u03b4 = 1, thickness \u000f = 0.5 but with various\npositions in the range 1 \u2264 rc \u2264 10. The Gaussian vortex (curve 1), discussed\nin \u00a72, has an initial period of exponential decay with \u03b3G \u2248 \u22120.0063 followed\nby an interval of decay related to the large\u2013r form of the vorticity and finally\n17\na region of algebraic decay linked to the remnant of vorticity in the core of the\nvortex (see regimes B and C of figure 2). What makes figure 13 so interesting\nis that all the results with \u03b4 = 1 (curves 2\u20135) appear to decay at exactly the\nsame rate and with the angular velocity of the Gaussian vortex (curve 1),\nat least up to some time. Thereafter they start to decay exponentially at a\nrate determined by the dominant Landau pole. Finally, when |Q2| drops be-\nlow some threshold, the vortex perturbation begins to decay algebraically (see\ncurve 4) as for the \u03b4 = 0 case. Curve 4 with rc = 6 exhibits a small region of\nnon\u2013exponential decay at t \u2248 2500 before decaying at the Landau pole value.\nThe decay rates for rc = 10 and 9 (curves 2 and 3 respectively) both tend\nto the exponential decay rate given by the dominant Landau pole. At larger\nvalues of rc the amplitude threshold for the algebraic decay may be reached\nbefore this period of exponential decay occurs; in this case the exponential\ndecay may not be observed.\n(a) x\ny\n\u22126\n\u22126\n6\n6\n(b) x\ny\n\u22126\n6\u22126\n6\nFig. 14. An n = 2 quasi\u2013mode within a profile (18) with \u03b4 = 1, \u000f = 0.3 and rc = 2.85\nat (a) t = 200 and (b) t = 1000. The grey scale is as in figure 1.\nThe features in real space of a quasi\u2013mode for a profile (18) with a defect\nare illustrated by figure 14, which can be compared with the purely Gaussian\ncase in figure 1. This figure shows a n = 2 disturbance to a profile with a\ndefect at rc = 2.85. Again we see a combination of spiral wind\u2013up coupled\nwith the modal behaviour, in which the elliptical distortion gives a sign of\nvorticity that depends on angle \u03b8 rather than on radius. At the early time, the\npicture 14(a) is similar to the Gaussian case in figure 1(a) with the flat defect\nat rc = 2.85 clearly visible. However at late times in figure 14(b) we note that\nthe elliptical distortion is still present (unlike in the Gaussian case), showing\nthat the quasi\u2013mode persists in this case, and we have a neutral mode. We\ncan also see how the defect interacts with the vorticity in the neighbourhood\nof rc = 2.85, where the spiral arms are broader. It is in this region where cat\u2019s\neyes (of a width of order \u000f = 0.3) could be maintained in the full nonlinear\nproblem.\n18\n4 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have studied how an axisymmetric vortex relaxes after being\nsubjected to a weak, instantaneous, non\u2013axisymmetric forcing. This has been\naccomplished using a two-pronged numerical approach: one of these relies\non the tracking of Landau poles in the complex plane while the other is a\nKeller\u2013box strategy applied to the linear problem. Our underlying vortex has\nbeen taken to be a Gaussian type which has been modified by inclusion of\nzone where the profile is artificially flattened. After a transient, the non\u2013\naxisymmetric perturbation decays with a decay rate and frequency fixed by\nthat Landau pole which has the least negative imaginary part. The time taken\nfor the perturbation to start to decay at this Landau pole rate depends upon\nthe structure of the axisymmetric profile.\nFor a profile with a flat region of thickness \u000f . 0.35 positioned at r = rc,\nwe have shown that two neutral modes exist at two distinct values of r = rc.\nMoreover, in the limit as the defect thickness \u000f\u2192 0 one of these neutral modes\nmoves to the point rc = 3.448, in accord with the asymptotic results of Le Dize`s\n[16]. Thus this study suggests that when cat\u2019s eyes below a critical thickness\nare generated in a vortex via a nonlinear mechanism, they can persist at two\ndistinct radii. However nonlinear mechanisms rarely give axisymmetric profiles\nas clean as the ones studied in this paper and the fine scale structure within the\neyes often becomes significant. It is clear that further detailed numerical work\nis required to ascertain whether our conclusions can be extended to nonlinear\nsituations.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was undertaken on the EPSRC grant EP\/D032202\/1.\nReferences\n[1] B.
