Because my \nresponse to Mader builds on my response to Deutscher, I will reply to \nDeutscher first.\nWhat am I doing, Deutscher asks, in mapping aspects of But-\nler, Schelling, and Irigaray onto one another? Closing her discussion, \nDeutscher wonders whether I might be following Irigaray\u2019s own reading \nmethod, that of expanding and transforming an author\u2019s project by focus-\ning on what that project itself excludes. Let me explore this suggestion \nwith reference to an instance of Irigaray\u2019s practice of this method, in her \nEthics of Sexual Difference, apropos of Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s late ontol-\nogy as sketched in the last chapter of The Visible and the Invisible, \u201cThe \nIntertwining\/The Chiasm.\u201d Many of Irigaray\u2019s criticisms of Merleau-Ponty \nin the course of her reading are debatable, but my concern here is solely \nto elucidate the nature of her reading method.1\nIrigaray reads Merleau-Ponty\u2019s late ontology of flesh as structured \nby an impens\u00e9\u2014an unthought\u2014of what she calls the \u201cmaternal sojourn.\u201d On \nd i f f e r e n c e s 151\nthe one hand, Irigaray recognizes that Merleau-Ponty attributes maternal \nqualities to flesh: he refers to flesh as \u201cthe mother\u201d (Merleau-Ponty 267) and \nas \u201cbeing by porosity and pregnancy\u201d (149). His text implies that in being \nenfolded in a world of flesh, the subject prolongs its \u201cmaternal sojourn,\u201d \nremaining ensconced in a substitute womb (Irigaray 173). But on the other \nhand, Irigaray thinks, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s flesh provides a womb that has been \nrestructured to give the subject a level of agency and control vis-\u00e0-vis its \nmother that no embryo or fetus has. Merleau-Ponty understands the flesh of \nthe world in terms of active\/passive, touching\/touched reversibility (differ-\nent variations of which obtain within each body-subject, between subjects, \nand between subjects and things). Thus, he still understands the contact or \ncontiguity between beings in terms of the traditional active\/passive polarity, \nalbeit reconceived as reversible. But, Irigaray suggests, in the contiguity \nbetween pregnant woman and fetus, both are \u201cmore passive than any pas-\nsivity taken in a passive-active couple\u201d (Ethics 154). Moreover, she thinks, \nby understanding touch in terms of reversibility, Merleau-Ponty conceives \nit as anticipating or prefiguring vision, insofar as the latter has historically \nbeen defined in terms of active\/passive polarity\u2014so that although Merleau-\nPonty roots vision in touch, he ultimately still privileges vision. But again, \nin the womb there obtains a relation of touching that absolutely precedes \nany possibility of vision, Irigaray suggests\u2014a relation in which neither \nparticipant can see the other.\nIn what sense, exactly, is the maternal sojourn the unthought \nof Merleau-Ponty\u2019s position? His account of flesh is structured by an effort \nto avoid acknowledging the maternal sojourn as Irigaray identifies it (as \ninvolving an invisible touching \u201cmore passive than the passive\u201d). The \nstructuring effects of the avoidance are manifest in that Merleau-Ponty \nconceives flesh with reference to the maternal sojourn (as its prolongation), \nyet in point-for-point antithesis to that sojourn. So the maternal sojourn \nis not a matter that lies unequivocally outside Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thought. \nThe maternal sojourn is an unthought that is internal to Merleau-Ponty\u2019s \nthought\u2014a matter to which he is not indifferent, of which on the contrary \nhe is aware, yet which he tries to avoid or disavow, with shaping effects \non what he does say. Irigaray, then, identifies an exclusion that constitutes \nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s thought. She does this by noting how the characteristics \nhe ascribes to flesh (reversibility; the mapping of vision onto touch) do not \nseem to fit the mother\/fetus relation. She describes that sojourn in terms \nthat negate Merleau-Ponty\u2019s terms for flesh, in terms of a touch devoid \nof reversible poles and preceding any visibility. Just as Deutscher says, \n152 Critical Exchange\nIrigaray\u2019s method is to expand and transform Merleau-Ponty\u2019s conception \nof flesh in light of what she identifies as its constitutive exclusion.\nThis lengthy account helps me clarify whether my own read-\ning method is the same as that of Irigaray. Let me consider my reading of \nJudith Butler. In Gender Trouble, Butler often appears to be interested in \nthe genealogy of claims about sex rather than in sex itself. But as Deutscher \nmay be suggesting, Butler might hesitate to draw this distinction, prefer-\nring to enfold \u201csex itself\u201d into our claims about sex as their purported \nsubject-matter or referent. This would create a difficulty for my view (as \nstated in my Luce Irigaray and the Philosophy of Sexual Difference) that \nButler addresses sex itself rather than \u201csex itself.\u201d\nAn important passage in Butler, from my perspective, occurs \nin her early essay \u201cVariations on Sex and Gender: Beauvoir, Wittig, Fou-\ncault,\u201d a passage in which Butler asks (with reference to Monique Wittig), \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we name as sexual features our mouths, hands, and backs? \nHer [Wittig\u2019s] answer: we only name sexual [. . .] those features functional \nin reproductive activity\u201d (135). I take it that Butler endorses this answer \nthat she attributes to Wittig, that is, that in Butler\u2019s view we class as sexed \nthose body parts that have to do with heterosexual sex and reproduction, \nand this because at the center of our gender norms is the prescription of \nheterosexual sex and reproduction (that is, because these norms com-\nprise what Butler in Gender Trouble calls \u201cthe heterosexual matrix\u201d). \nSo, for Butler, what we count as sex is shaped by gender: certain bodily \nproperties count as sex-conferring just when they are viewed in light of \nheteronormative gender.2\nAre these claims of Butler\u2019s claims about sex itself? They do \namount to a claim that sex is how biology appears to us, or is the signifi-\ncance that biology takes on for us, in light of gender. But does this entail \nthat really, in the (hypothetical) absence of gender, biology is nonsexed? \nThis implication would follow if Butler thought that we only count certain \nbodily properties as sexed because of gender or that certain bodily prop-\nerties only appear to be sexed and to constitute us as sexed individuals \ngiven gender. (This is far from an absurd view\u2014there could certainly be \nbreasts, penises, etc., without gender, but without gender, those bodily \nparts would not suffice to make individuals sexed.) While Butler might \nbe read as agnostic here\u2014as thinking that we just cannot know what \nbiology, absent gender, might be like\u2014she can also be read as affirming \nthe only in the above statements. Indeed, she regularly makes statements \nthat encourage such a reading. Consider, for example, her statement that \nd i f f e r e n c e s 153\n\u201cgender [. . .] designate[s] the very apparatus of production whereby the \nsexes themselves are established\u201d (Gender 7, emphasis added). The talk of \nestablishing suggests that sex is instituted or created for the first time as \nan effect of gender, so that without gender, there would be no sex. Insofar \nas Butler\u2019s texts admit of and, at times, encourage such readings, the idea \nthat we are naturally, biologically, nonsexed can readily be drawn from \nButler\u2019s thought despite her reluctance to theorize about sex itself.\nThis is not to say that the avoidance of sex itself (like the mater-\nnal sojourn for Merleau-Ponty) structures Butler\u2019s thought. The situation \nis rather that, although she has good reasons for not wanting to theorize \nsex itself (namely, her concern to foreground the political and contested \ncharacter of all reference to sex), she comes close to engaging in such \ntheorization, in spite of herself, to the extent that she suggests that we \nonly count as sex what we count as sex because of gender. My method \nof reading Butler, then, is to extend her into what, in spite of herself, she \ncomes close to doing.\nMy method of reading Irigaray is similar. She has reasons \nfor denying that we are naturally anything other than either female or \nmale in each case. But to support her belief in natural sexual duality, she \nreads thinkers\u2014Hegel, H\u00f6lderlin\u2014who write from within a tradition of \nphilosophical thinking about nature, also including Schelling, in which \nnature is seen as entering into but always also passing beyond dualities. \nAs such, Irigaray finds herself writing from within an approach to nature \nin which nature always exceeds dualities, but she stops short of embracing \nthis approach in full. Nonetheless, to the extent that she comes close to \ndoing so by virtue of positioning herself within this tradition, her thought \nadmits of being extended into that of which she has stopped short. The \nway I read Butler and Irigaray, then, is to extend their ideas not in terms of \navoidances that structure their thought, but rather into areas with which \ntheir thought is contiguous despite itself.\nTurning now to Mader\u2019s many questions, I will focus on two: \n(1) whether the rhythmic difference with which (as I tried to show in my \nbook) Irigaray equates sexual difference collapses back into conventional \nbiological sex difference; and (2) how we can access putative tendencies, \npotentials, or natures other than through what they allegedly condition\u2014so \nthat there is a threat of tautology in this talk of tendencies and of the puta-\ntive tendencies being redundant. (The problem here recalls that discussed \nby Hegel under the rubric of the \u201cdilemma of explanation\u201d: if we invoke \nunderlying dispositions or tendencies in order to explain something, then \n154 Critical Exchange\neither those dispositions must have a different content to the explanan-\ndum\u2014in which case, though, an explanatory gap remains\u2014or the disposi-\ntions have the same content as the explanandum\u2014in which case they are \nredundant [465].)3\nOn the former question, as Mader rightly says, Irigaray often \ndescribes sexual difference as a difference in the relations of boys and girls \nto their maternal origin. Irigaray has recently suggested that this is her \nfundamental account of sexual difference, anything else she has said of \nit being secondary.4 However, the relational account cannot be Irigaray\u2019s \nonly or most fundamental view of sexual difference because there must \nbe a difference in the potential generative capacities of boys and girls \nto make possible their divergent resolutions of the transition away from \ntheir maternal origin. This worries me because it suggests that Irigaray \nthinks (as Mader has neatly put it in a recent article) that \u201cthe girl is in fact \na little mother born of another mother\u201d (374). Yet one of the most attrac-\ntive elements of Irigaray\u2019s thought, to my mind, is her proposal that we \nshould disambiguate being a woman from being a mother and contest the \nreduction of the female to a maternal function. Disappointingly, Irigaray \nnow seems to effect the very reduction that she promised to contest. To \na significant extent, it is to circumvent this problem that I have tried to \nexcavate from Irigaray\u2019s writings an alternative understanding of the sexes \nin terms of rhythms of growth rather than potential relations to biologi-\ncal reproduction (and so, too, why I have sought to distinguish this talk of \nrhythms from discourses of biology). In this understanding, girls and boys \nwould relate to their mothers via resemblance or difference in respect of \nrhythm rather than reproductive function.\nBut, as Mader convincingly argues, to know that there are just \ntwo\u2014linear versus cyclical\u2014rhythms and that these correlate with our \ncurrent sex categories, Irigaray must already be relying on those very cate-\ngories, which differentiate human beings on sexual-reproductive grounds. \nThis reliance is reflected in that Irigaray picks out only\u2014or at least primar-\nily\u2014bodily features relating to sex and reproduction as manifestations of \nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s rhythms, while neglecting nonreproduction-related \nfeatures that disconfirm her linear\/cyclical distinction.\nIf Irigarayan sexual difference is sex difference redescribed \nphilosophically as grounded in rhythms, then, sexual difference is still \nsex difference so redescribed. In that case, contrary to what I argued in \nmy book, later Irigaray does think that sexual difference, both as rhythmic \ndifference and (derivatively) as difference vis-\u00e0-vis maternal origins, is \nentangled with\u2014not cleanly separable from\u2014biological, reproductive sex \nd i f f e r e n c e s 155\ndifference. But this entanglement of sexual and sex difference need not be \na problem with Irigaray\u2019s position unless reference to biological sex must \nalways be merely ideological.5 And, I submit, it is not merely ideological, \nbecause\u2014contrary to Butler as I interpreted her earlier\u2014we do not only \ncluster certain reproduction-related biological properties together because \nof gender; we do so partly because they really do cluster.6\nWhat of the consequent problem that, for Irigaray, the little girl \nseems to be a little mother like her mother? I am drawn toward the tenta-\ntive thought that Irigaray is pointing out a truth: that there is a centrality of \nthe mother to each child (a psychical, not necessarily a social, centrality), \nwhich is such that\u2014generally, not universally\u2014as any child learns his or \nher sex\/gender identity, he or she maps this identity in terms of being the \nsame or different in kind to the mother. So a sense of being (for instance) \nfemale will be bound up from the start with an identification with the \nmother. Thus, perhaps Irigaray\u2019s work can assist in thinking why it might \npsychically be very difficult\u2014albeit not necessarily impossible\u2014for us to \ndisambiguate the maternal and the female\/feminine.\nMader\u2019s second question concerns the broadly Aristotelian \nmetaphysics of tendencies, potentials, and realization that I find in Iriga-\nray. Generally, I think that reference to essences, potentials, and \u201cnatures\u201d \ncan be politically valuable by providing grounds for criticizing existing \nsocial institutions that stifle our potentials. Likewise, the claim that these \ninstitutions are a certain way\u2014for instance, patriarchal\u2014\u201cessentially\u201d \nrather than \u201caccidentally\u201d can support a politics of radical change by \nentailing that those institutions must be fundamentally transformed and \nrestructured. Reference to nature and to essences, then, can provide \nnormative grounds for social criticism.\nThe problem, though, is that as soon as we want to identify any \nparticular unfulfilled tendencies or dispositions, it becomes difficult not \nto naturalize actual features of human beings. An ontology of flux and \nbecoming in which there are no determined regularities or dispositions \nmight therefore seem to promise more critical leverage. The problems with \nsuch an ontology, though, are, first, that without identifying any particular \nunfulfilled tendencies, we cannot recommend any determinate direction \nof political change and, second, that since the flux of materiality will have \nto be restricted in some ways by any determinate political arrangement, \nwe need further criteria to tell us which restrictions are more desirable \nthan others. Supposing that for these reasons we do want to identify some \nunfulfilled tendencies and potentials: how can we do so since ex hypothesi \nthese are unrealized? Foucault\u2019s suspicion would be that when we make \n156 Critical Exchange\nany such identification, we have been led to postulate as an unrealized \npotential something that is in actuality prohibited or barred (for instance, \nsexuality) merely because the prohibition inescapably refers to what it \nbars in a way that suggests that that thing really, extradiscursively, exists. \nWhen Irigaray identifies unfulfilled potentials on the part of women and \nmen, something slightly different appears to happen: she seems to natu-\nralize what is already actual, such as the norm reducing the female to the \nmaternal, or certain socially legitimated male forms of aggression. But \nthen rather than facilitating change, Irigaray\u2019s reference to natures or \npotentials risks prohibiting change by reinstalling the actual as its horizon.\nHowever, Irigaray\u2019s mode of reading may offer a way forward. \nAs I have suggested, she identifies the unthought of a text by looking for \nwhat that text both refers to and also negates, indicating the presence \nof a structuring avoidance. Irigaray then thinks the text\u2019s unthought by \nnegating that text\u2019s negation, for example by characterizing the mater-\nnal sojourn in terms of a touching prior to visibility, negating Merleau-\nPonty\u2019s idea that touch and vision map onto one another. This reading \nmethod might give Irigaray a way to identify women\u2019s (and perhaps men\u2019s) \nunfulfilled potentials as the unthought of Western culture (assuming for \nnow that we can speak of such an entity)\u2014as that which Western culture \nnegates or thwarts but to which it also refers. But there has to be evidence \nthat Western culture refers to, or is preoccupied with, these potentials as \nwell as thwarting them. The evidence, for Irigaray, is that Western culture \nhas its intellectual and mythical basis in certain ancient Greek texts, such \nas the Oresteia of Aeschylus, which narrate the suppression of preexisting \nmatrilineal forms of life that operated upon a more cyclical time frame. \nWestern culture thus combines a mythical reference to matrilineal and \ncyclical forms of life with a point-for-point negation of their features\u2014\nbeing instead patriarchal and organized around the linear temporality \nof progress and technological development. By negating this negation, \nIrigaray can infer that these matrilineal forms of life had a cyclical time \nframe because there is a connection between being female and cyclical \nrhythms, and hence that female sexual difference consists in a distinc-\ntive rhythm of growth unrealized in modern Western societies. At least \nin principle, then, Irigaray\u2019s reading strategy offers her a way to identify \nunfulfilled potentials without simply reproducing what actually exists.\nalison stone is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Lancaster University.

She is currently \nworking on a book on early German Romanticism.\n1 The objection that Irigaray\u2019s \ncriticisms of Merleau-Ponty are \nuncharitable, artificially inflating \nthe difference between his ontol-\nogy of f lesh and her philosophy \nof sexual difference, is found in \nmany of the articles in Olkowski \nand Weiss.\n2 It might seem that Butler\u2019s state-\nment regarding Wittig concerns \nsex in the sense of the erotic \nrather than (as I have interpreted \nit) in the sense of biological sex \ndifference. But the context makes \nclear that Butler sees these two \nsenses of sex as integrally related. \n(Just before the above-quoted \nstatement she writes: \u201cFor Wit-\ntig, when we name sexual differ-\nence, we create it,\u201d and \u201cWhat \ndistinguishes the sexes are those \nanatomical features, which either \nbear on reproduction directly, or \nare construed to aid in its even-\ntual success.\u201d) Butler understands \nthe integral relation as follows: \nbecause our gender norms are \norganized by heteronormativity, \nit is those bodily properties that \nare relevant to heterosexual sex \nand reproduction that are taken to \ndefine us and to sort us into two \nsexes\u2014so that the two senses of \nsex are, effectively, conflated.\n3 The phrase \u201cdilemma of explana-\ntion\u201d comes from Inwood 59\u201364.\n4 University of Nottingham \nSeminar held by Irigaray, June \n2006.
