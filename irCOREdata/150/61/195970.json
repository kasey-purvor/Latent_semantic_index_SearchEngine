The study focuses on 4 h during which distinct dawn\/dusk asymmetries in the wave characteristics were observed with multiple field line resonance (FLR) structures observed in the dawn flank at 1.7, 2.6, 3.3, 4.2 and 5.4 mHz and compressional oscillations in the dusk flank at 1.7 and 2.3 mHz. The data indicated an anti-sunward propagation in both the dawn and dusk flanks and a low azimuthal m number (m6) suggesting a generation mechanism external to the Earth's magnetosphere. A sudden increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure followed by a period of strongly northward, Bz dominated IMF, coincides with the observations and also a large increase in Pc5 wave power observed in the dawn flank.
