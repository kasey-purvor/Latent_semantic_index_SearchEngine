The SuperDARN HF radars have been\nemployed in the past to investigate the spectral\ncharacteristics of coherent backscatter from L-shell\naligned features in the auroral E region. The present\nstudy employs all-sky camera observations of the\naurora from Husafell, Iceland, and the two Super-\nDARN radars located on Iceland, \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r and\nStokkseyri, to determine the optical signature of such\nbackscatter features. It is shown that, especially during\nquiet geomagnetic conditions, the backscatter region is\nclosely associated with east-west aligned di\u0080use auroral\nfeatures, and that the two move in tandem with each\nother. This association between optical and radar\naurora has repercussions for the instability mechanisms\nresponsible for generating the E region irregularities\nfrom which radars scatter. This is discussed and\ncompared with previous studies investigating the rela-\ntionship between optical and VHF radar aurora. In\naddition, although it is known that E region backscat-\nter is commonly observed by SuperDARN radars, the\npresent study demonstrates for the first time that\nmultiple radars can observe the same feature to extend\nover at least 3 h of magnetic local time, allowing\nprecipitation features to be mapped over large portions\nof the auroral zone.\nKey words: Ionosphere (particle precipitation; plasma\nwaves and instabilities)\nIntroduction\nSeveral studies, including those of Villain et al. (1987,\n1990), Hanuise et al. (1991) and Milan and Lester (1998,\n1999), have employed HF radars, such as those which\nform SuperDARN (Greenwald et al., 1995), to investi-\ngate the spectral characteristics of coherent backscatter\nfrom decametre-wavelength E region irregularities in the\nauroral electrojet region. In these studies, the E region\nbackscatter generally takes the form of L-shell aligned\nfeatures 2\u00b0\u20133\u00b0 of latitude in width, within the near-range\nportion of the radar field-of-view. The dominant\ndirection of irregularity drift within this backscatter\nregion is eastward or westward if the observations are\nmade in the westward or eastward electrojet regions,\nrespectively. The present study demonstrates that during\ntwo intervals of simultaneous observation of such E\nregion features within the fields-of-view of two Super-\nDARN radars, concurrent all-sky camera optical mea-\nsurements show these to be closely associated with\ndi\u0080use visible aurora. Such observations have repercus-\nsions for the irregularity generating mechanisms within\nthese regions, and this is discussed with reference to\nsimilar work conducted during the early 1970s with\nVHF radars.\nExperimental arrangement\nThe radar measurements from the present study were\nmade by the two SuperDARN radars situated on\nIceland: the Iceland East and Iceland West radars\nlocated at \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r (63.77\u00b0N, 339.46\u00b0E) and Stok-\nkseyri (63.86\u00b0N, 337.98\u00b0E), respectively. These radars\nsound along sixteen beams, separated by 3.24\u00b0 in\nazimuth, with the boresite of each radar being 30\u00b0 east\nof north and 59\u00b0 west of north in the case of the Iceland\nEast and West radars, respectively. Each beam is gated\ninto 75 range bins. Observations from two intervals will\nbe presented, during which the radars operated in\nslightly di\u0080erent modes. During the first interval (study\nI), 0300 to 0504 UT, 29 September, 1998, the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r\nradar had a range to the first gate of 180 km, and a gate\nlength of 45 km; in the case of the Stokkseyri radar,\nthese were 540 km and 30 km, respectively. Figure 1\nindicates the locations of the fields-of-view of the two\nradars, though only the first 25 range gates of each are\nCorrespondence to: S. E. Milan\ne-mail: Steve.Milan@ion.le.ac.uk\nAnn. Geophysicae 18, 608\u2013617 (2000) \u00d3 EGS \u2013 Springer-Verlag 2000\nshown as only near-range scatter is of interest to this\nstudy. Included in this figure is the location of the\nstatistical auroral oval (Feldstein and Starkov, 1967) for\nlow geomagnetic activity levels, indicating that the oval\ncrosses the near-range fields-of-view of both radars\nduring this interval. The Stokkseyri radar was operating\nat a frequency of 11.5 MHz and the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r radar\nwas scanning in frequency between 10 MHz and\n17 MHz in approximately 1 MHz steps, completing a\nfrequency sweep every 14 min.\nDuring the second interval (study II), 2200 UT, 15\nFebruary, 1999 to 0200 UT on the following day, both\nradars operated with a range to the first gate of 180 km\nand a gate length of 15 km, and both at a frequency near\n11 MHz. The range resolution was hence much im-\nproved during this second study period: the extent of the\nwhole field-of-view (all 75 range gates) of the two radars\nis the same as that indicated for only the first 25 range\ngates of the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r radar in Fig. 1.\nThe all-sky camera (ASC) employed in the study\nwas located at Husafell (64.67\u00b0N, 338.97\u00b0E), Iceland\n(see Fig. 1). The method of observation has been\ndescribed in detail by Sato and Saemundson (1987).\nFigure 2 illustrates the mapping of the radar fields-of-\nview during study period I into the northern portion of\nthe ASC field-of-view. The ASC was aligned with\nrespect to the magnetic meridian (indicated in Fig. 1),\nwith east to the left and west to the right of each ASC\nimage. The horizon describes a circle around the\nperiphery of each image, at an angle of 90\u00b0 from the\nzenith; the point directly overhead the ASC, a zenith\nangle of 0\u00b0, is located at the centre of the field-of-view.\nA fundamental limitation of ground-based observa-\ntions of the aurora is the ambiguity in determining the\nlocation of an optical feature without a detailed\nknowledge of the altitude profile of the emission\nintensity. Only auroral features situated directly over-\nhead the observing site can be located with certainty,\nFig. 1. A map indicating the\nlocations of the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r and\nStokkseyri SuperDARN radars\nand the Husafell all-sky camera\nsite employed in the present\nstudy. The location of the all-sky\ncamera site at Tjo\u00a8rnes, to be\nemployed in a future campaign,\nis also indicated. The SAMNET\nstation Hella (HLL) is co-locat-\ned with the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r radar.\nThe locations of the first 25\nrange gates of the radars\u2019s fields-\nof-view for study interval I are\nshown, as well as the statistical\nlocation of the auroral oval for\nquiet geomagnetic conditions.\nLine-of-sight Doppler velocity\ndetermined for the radar scans\nstarting at 0306 and 0356 UT\nduring study interval I are col-\nour-coded.

Most aurora produce emission over a\nrange of altitudes, and hence even narrow features\nlocated at a given geographic location appear spread in\nzenith angle within an ASC field-of-view. This will be\ndiscussed further later in relation to actual observa-\ntions. In terms of mapping the location of optical\nfeatures within the radars\u2019 fields-of-view, a single\nemission altitude for the aurora must be assumed.\nFigure 2a, b indicates the locations of the first 25 range\ngates of the two radars (for study interval I), for\nassumed auroral emission altitudes of 110 km\n(E region) and 250 km (F region), respectively. Dot-\ndashed lines indicate the loci of magnetic latitudes\nL = 60\u00b0, 65\u00b0, 70\u00b0, and 75\u00b0. In general, increasing the\nassumed emission altitude decreases the zenith angles\nto which the radars\u2019 fields-of-view map.\nObservations\nStudy interval I\nDuring the first study interval, 0300 to 0504 UT, 29\nSeptember, 1998, the instrumentation on Iceland was\nlocated within the region of the westward auroral\nelectrojet (magnetic local time MLT \u00bb UT). Figure 1\nillustrates the radar measurements of line-of-sight\nDoppler velocity from two times during this interval,\n0306 and 0356 UT. Positive and negative velocities\nrepresent irregularity drift toward and away from each\nradar, respectively. Several regions of backscatter are\nobserved, the type of backscatter being denoted by\nletters in the figure. The altitude from which the\nbackscatter originates can be determined using inter-\nferometric techniques in the manner outlined in Milan\net al. (1997) and Milan and Lester (1999). It is found\nthat those regions denoted \u2018\u2018F\u2019\u2019 are backscatter from the\nF region ionosphere, and are not of interest to the\npresent study. \u2018\u2018G\u2019\u2019 indicates a region of ground\nbackscatter, which tends to have very low Doppler\nvelocity and spectral width. At the nearest ranges,\nbackscatter from the ionization trails of meteoroids is\nobserved (Hall et al., 1997), this meteor scatter appear-\ning as the sporadic echoes denoted \u2018\u2018M\u2019\u2019. The backscat-\nter of interest to this study originates at E region\naltitudes and tends to take the form of L-shell- or\nauroral oval-aligned features, denoted \u2018\u2018E\u2019\u2019. Similar\nfeatures have previously been discussed by Villain et al.\n(1987, 1990) and Milan and Lester (1998), though it has\nnot been demonstrated previously that these features\ncan be observed simultaneously by two radars over, in\nthis case, 3 h of MLT in zonal extent. In the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r\nand Stokkseyri radar fields-of-view the velocities asso-\nciated with these features are negative and positive,\nrespectively. This is consistent with eastward drift, as\nexpected in the westward electrojet region. Between 0306\nand 0356 UT, the E region scatter progresses slowly\nequatorward. This is shown more clearly in Fig. 3a, b\nwhich are range-time-power plots of radar backscatter\nfrom beam 5 of both the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r and Stokkseyri\nradars. The E region backscatter features of interest\nappear between range gates 1 and 22 of the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r\nobservations (Fig. 3a) and gates 0 and 15 of the\nStokkseyri observations (Fig. 3b). Prior to approxi-\nmately 0420 UT, an equatorward motion of the radar\nbackscatter is observed, in the case of the Stokkseyri\nradar to the very nearest ranges of the field-of-view\n(remembering that the range to the first gate and the\ngate length is di\u0080erent for the two radars). After 0420\nUT, the backscatter region returns poleward, which in\nthe case of the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r observations, accompanies a\nbifurcation of the backscatter region.\nThe optical observations from this interval will now\nbe described. A keyogram of the ASC observations is\npresented in Fig. 3c. This indicates the time-variation of\nthe auroral emission intensity, as a function of zenith\nangle, along the magnetic meridian of the ASC field-\nof-view. A greyscale is employed to represent observed\nintensity, more intense features appearing darker. In\naddition, in Fig. 4b, d, f, h, j and l all-sky images are\nillustrated from selected times during this interval, as\nindicated by arrows at the top of Fig. 3 (the first two\nalso correspond to the times illustrated in Fig. 1).

At the\nstart of the interval, the ASC observations consist of a\nfaint magnetic east-west aligned arc to the north of\nIceland, at a zenith angle of 70\u00b0, which gains in intensity\nand gradually drifts southward to a zenith angle of 55\u00b0\nby 0415 UT. After 0415 UT this arc intensifies consid-\nerably and splits into two main features, the most\npoleward of which drifts poleward to 70\u00b0 and the most\nequatorward of which expands rapidly equatorward,\nover the zenith of the ASC and into the southern portion\nof the field-of-view, to )65\u00b0. During this interval,\nsignificant structure is observed between the northern\nand southern extremes of the auroral emission.\nAs mentioned previously, auroral emission can be\nobserved from a broad range of altitudes. This is best\ndemonstrated in Fig. 4d and f. At these times the arc\nfeature observed appears to have a well-defined \u2018\u2018pole-\nward\u2019\u2019 boundary, but a more gradual decrease in\nintensity at its \u2018\u2018equatorward\u2019\u2019 boundary.

MW\nidentifies the Milky Way in the optical observations\n612 S. E. Milan et al.: Comparison of HF radar and optical auroral forms\n(Yeoman et al., 1990) magnetometer networks indicates\nthat the onset of a substorm expansion phase occurred\nnear 0410 UT. This is exemplified in Fig. 5 which\npresents H-, D-, and Z-component magnetograms from\nthe Hella (HLL) SAMNET station, which is co-located\nwith the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r radar. Prior to approximately 0400\nUT the magnetograms are quiet. The negative bay in the\nH component after this time is indicative of the presence\nof a substorm-associated westward electrojet. The neg-\native excursion of the Z component indicates that the\ncentre of this electrojet is located poleward of the\nmagnetometer station. These observations suggest that\nthe bifurcation and structure observed within the optical\nand radar aurora after 0415 UT corresponds to\nsubstorm break-up.\nA direct comparison of the radar and optical\nobservations is made in Fig. 4. For each ASC image,\nthe simultaneous backscatter power observations from\neach radar are projected onto the field-of-view of the\nHusafell ASC (Fig. 4a, c, e, g, i and k). The backscatter\npower is represented by the same greyscale employed in\nFig. 3. Those regions of backscatter which originate in\nthe E region and which should be compared with the\noptical aurora are indicated by arrows in Fig. 4a, c, e\nand g. A very close correspondence between radar and\noptical aurora exists at these times. A projection altitude\nof 250 km has been employed as this appears to give the\nbest co-location of the radar and optical observations in\nthis case; this will be discussed in more detail later. After\napproximately 0430 UT (Fig. 4i and k) the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r\nradar backscatter region bifurcates and the low latitude\nportion of the backscatter progresses equatorward. This\nis mirrored in the optical observations (see especially\nFig. 4l), but the correspondence between optical and\nradar features is no longer as clear as previously.\nStudy interval II\nDuring the second interval of study, radar measure-\nments were made between 2200 UT, 15 February, and\n0200 UT, 16 February, 1999. Unfortunately, the clouds\nabove Husafell parted for only the brief period between\n2353 UT and 0035 UT, and so ASC images are available\nfrom this interval only. However, even at times with no\ncorresponding optical information, the radar observa-\ntions are of interest. During this interval, the radar\nrange resolution, at 15 km, is significantly improved\nover that in study interval I. Figure 6 presents maps of\nbackscatter power and line-of-sight Doppler velocity\nfrom the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r and Stokkseyri radars at six\nrepresentative times from study interval II. Throughout\nthis period multiple, parallel, L-shell-aligned backscatter\nfeatures are observed. (As in study interval I, large\nregions of backscatter in the far field-of-view originate\nin the F region and are not of interest to the present\nstudy.) In general, those features in the near ranges\nwhich are of greatest backscatter power are observed in\nboth radars\u2019 fields-of-view simultaneously, most obvi-\nous in Fig. 6e, g, where two parallel features are present.\nIn some cases, up to four parallel features can be\nobserved in the field-of-view of at least one radar,\nas indicated by arrows in Fig. 6c. On occasion these\nL-shell-aligned backscatter features can be observed to\nextend over three hours of local time, such as the most\npoleward feature in Fig. 6a. Individual features can be\nas narrow as 30 to 100 km, resolvable, presumably,\nbecause of the increased spatial resolution of the radar\nscans, but the overall E region backscatter region tends\nto be several degrees of latitude in width. The Doppler\nvelocity of the backscatter is predominantly negative in\nStokkseyri and positive in \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r, consistent with\nwestward flow in the eastward electrojet. There are\nregions of backscatter, however, for instance the most\npoleward E region feature of the four indicated by\narrows in Fig. 6c, in which the drift is in the opposite\nsense, suggesting the presence of a westward electrojet.\nMoreover, within the eastward electrojet, the velocity\nwithin two parallel features is not necessarily uniform,\nmost clearly seen in Fig. 6d in the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r backscat-\nter, in which a higher- and lower-velocity channel exist.\nAfter approximately 2350 UT (Figs. 6i\u2013l) only a\nsingle backscatter feature is observed in the near-range\nof the fields-of-view. This period corresponds to the time\nwhen ASC images are available. At the start of this\ninterval a very faint and somewhat di\u0080use auroral\nfeature is observed near the northern extreme of the\nASC field-of-view, which later drifts equatorward.\nFigure 7 presents two ASC images from 0000 UT and\n0030 UT. Note that the contrast in these images has\nbeen stretched considerably to emphasise the auroral\nfeature. The approximate location of the lower border\nof the arc is superimposed on each image, represented\nas a dot-dashed line. The mapped geographic location\nFig. 5.

A good\ncorrespondence between the location of the auroral\nform and the equatorward-drifting backscatter feature\nis found.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nTwo intervals of simultaneous observation of optical and\nHF radar aurora, one each in the vicinity of the westward\nand eastward auroral electrojet, have been investigated.\nThe first half of study interval I, prior to 0415 UT, was\ngeomagnetically quiet. During this period a single,\napproximately L-shell-aligned optical arc was observed\nin the northern portion of the all-sky camera field-of-\nview, drifting slowly equatorward. At this time an\nL-shell-aligned backscatter feature was observed within\nthe fields-of-view of both HF radars, which appeared\nclosely associated with the optical arc and moved in\ntandem with it. The onset of a substorm expansion phase\nat 0415 UT, with substorm break-up observed by the\nASC, marked the beginning of an interval during which\nthe correspondence between the radar and optical\nfeatures became less clear, though similarities were still\nobserved in the motions and general features of the radar\nand optical aurora. Substorm break-up is known to\nadversely a\u0080ect the performance of HF radars in two\nways (see Milan et al., 1999, for a detailed discussion of\nboth e\u0080ects). In the first, enhancement of electron density\nin the E region, known as sporadic- or auroral-E,\nproduces deviation of the radar beams and \u2018\u2018blanketing\u2019\u2019\nof the ionosphere above. In the second, enhancement of\nthe D region produces attenuation of the radar signal.\nThe latter e\u0080ect can produce a loss of radar backscatter,\nthough this does not appear to be a concern during the\npresent observations. However, an increase in the\namount of ground backscatter observed by the Stok-\nkseyri radar toward the end of the interval suggests that\nsporadic-E is indeed a\u0080ecting the radar propagation.\nGround backscatter is not observed by the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r\nradar, where the observations appear una\u0080ected by\nsporadic-E. In this case the separation of the radar and\noptical aurora must be due to a change in the nature of\nthe precipitation associated with the auroral feature or\nwith the generating mechanism of the irregularities\nresponsible for the radar backscatter. A change in\nprecipitation energy, for instance, could a\u0080ect the\naltitude of emission of the aurora.\nThe best correlation between the locations of radar\nand optical aurora occurred under the assumption that\nthe auroral emission originated primarily at an altitude\nof 250 km during study interval I and 110 km in study\ninterval II. That is not to say, however, that we believe\nthe optical and radar aurora are exactly co-located:\nthe only way to determine the exact correspondence\nbetween radar and optical aurora is to remove the\naltitude ambiguity associated with the auroral emission\nby making observations of radar backscatter directly\noverhead the ASC location, at the zenith of the ASC\nfield-of-view. This would also allow the true latitudinal\nwidth of the auroral features to be determined. Unfor-\ntunately, the present experimental set-up does not allow\nsuch observations to be made in association with radar\nobservations of E region backscatter. An ASC located in\nnortheast Iceland, however, would be ideally situated,\nunder the near-range field-of-view of the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r\nradar, to make such a comparison possible. Indeed, such\nan optical campaign is planned for September 1999 at\nTjo\u00a8rnes (see Fig. 1). Prior to such a definitive study,\nthe present observations suggest only that the optical\nand E region HF radar aurora are closely related.\nThe co-location of optical and some F regionHF radar\naurora in the dayside auroral region has been demon-\nstrated previously (Rodger et al., 1995; Milan et al.,\n1999b, c), and Milan et al. (1998) indicated that the\nauroral oval tends to be a discrete target for HF radars.\nThese studies, and the present observations, suggest that\nmagnetospheric precipitation, or the electrodynamics\nassociated with precipitation regions, are a primary\ngeneration mechanism for ionospheric irregularities, the\ntargets from which HF coherent radars scatter. Also,\nMilan et al. (1999a) demonstrated that HF radar back-\nFig. 7. The optical signature of the arc observed during study\ninterval II\nS. E. Milan et al.: Comparison of HF radar and optical auroral forms 615\nscatter spectra increased in power and could gain\nsubsidiary spectral peaks in the vicinity of auroral arcs,\nas identified by incoherent scatter techniques. The\nprecipitation features discussed by Milan et al. (1999a)\nappeared small in comparison to the size of a radar range\ngate, and, in the absence of simultaneous optical data,\nwere interpreted as discrete aurora. In the present case,\nthe optical features identified with the radar backscatter\nappear more di\u0080use in nature, and the backscatter region\nassociated with them can be several range gates in\nlatitudinal extent, especially during study interval I;\nindeed the width of the backscatter region as a whole is\nclose to the expected width of the auroral electrojets. This\nis similar to early work which demonstrated a relation-\nship between VHF radar backscatter from metre-scale E\nregion irregularities and the auroral electrojets (e.g.\nGreenwald et al., 1973) and optical aurora (e.g. Balsley\net al., 1973; Greenwald et al., 1975; Romick et al., 1974;\nHunsucker et al., 1975). These studies suggested that\nwhile a relationship did exist, the radar and discrete\noptical aurora were located adjacent to each other, but\nwere not co-located. In general, radar backscatter was\nobserved equatorward of auroral luminosity features in\nthe eastward electrojet region, and it was assumed that\nthis relationship would be reversed in the westward\nelectrojet. The implication was that the radar irregular-\nities were generated in the horizontal Hall current that\nflowed adjacent to auroral arc features. Two slightly\ndi\u0080erent interpretations of the observations were for-\nwarded. In the first, this current flowed in a region of high\nelectric field but low conductivity (relative to that\nproduced by the precipitation within the arc) associated\nwith the electrodynamics of the arc system (Greenwald\net al., 1973); the location of this high electric field region,\npoleward or equatorward of the arc, is thought to be\nopposite in the eastward and westward electrojets. The\nsecond interpretation invoked the electron density gra-\ndients at the edges of arcs: the northward- or southward-\ndirected electric field of the eastward and westward\nelectrojets favours the generation of irregularities by the\ngradient drift instability on the equatorward or poleward\nside of arcs (Balsley et al., 1973). It should be noted that\nhorizontal gradients should play amore influential ro\u02c6le in\nthe generation of irregularities in the HF regime than the\nVHF regime (e.g. St.-Maurice et al., 1994). In the present\nstudy, we found the best co-location of radar and optical\naurora if the emission altitude was assumed to be 250\nand 110 km in study intervals I and II, respectively.\nIf, however, a uniform altitude of, say, 200 km was\nemployed, the radar backscatter would be located at the\nnorthern and southern edges of the optical aurora in the\nwestward and eastward electrojet regions, respectively. In\nthis case, the present observations would be consistent\nwith the VHF radar studies.\nIn the context of HF radar observations of E region\nelectrojet backscatter, our findings support the sugges-\ntion of Villain et al. (1987, 1990) that particle precipi-\ntation must be associated with these commonly observed\nradar features. Within E region scatter, Villain et al.\n(1987, 1990) identified HF radar backscatter spectra\nwith characteristics consistent with the two-stream and\nelectrostatic ion cyclotron instabilities, though in re-\ngions of sub-critical horizontal electric field, i.e. in\nregions in which the ion drift was below the threshold\nnecessary for the generation of these instabilities. Their\nconclusion was that additional free energy could be\navailable from vertically-moving electrons. More spe-\ncifically, these were thought to be upward-moving\nthermal electrons carrying downward return current to\nclose the upward current associated with electron\nprecipitation. Again, this would be expected to occur\nadjacent to the luminosity feature, consistent with the\npresent observation of aurora closely associated with\nthe backscatter regions, though again suggesting that the\ntwo are not necessarily co-located. Further work is\nnecessary: as reported by Villain et al. (1987, 1990) and\nalso Milan and Lester (1998) and especially Milan\nand Lester (1999), a complex variety of spectral types\nand populations exist within HF radar backscatter from\nthe auroral E region. The ultimate goal of the present\nline of investigation is to relate di\u0080erent spectral\ncharacteristics with features in the optical aurora.\nUnfortunately, the current data-set is insu\u0081cient to\nachieve this, and, as discussed already, an ASC located\nunder the field-of-view of the \u00b3ykkvib\u00e6r radar is needed\nto make such a detailed comparison possible.\nIn summary, this study indicates that during periods\nof low geomagnetic activity, L-shell-aligned features in\nHF radar backscatter from E region altitudes in the\nauroral electrojet regions have an optical counterpart\nand hence are associated with particle precipitation.\nA conclusive determination of the exact relationship\nbetween optical and radar aurora is made di\u0081cult by\nambiguities in the altitude of emission of auroral forms.\nAn experiment with a more favourable observational\ngeometry is necessary to fully resolve this issue. How-\never, the ability to image such electrojet scatter regions\nwith many radars simultaneously potentially allows the\nSuperDARN network to map the location of precipita-\ntion features over large portions of the high latitude\nionosphere.\nAcknowledgements.
