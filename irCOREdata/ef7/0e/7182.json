The World\nWide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative has played a leading role in promoting the\nimportance of accessibility and developing guidelines that can help when developing accessible web\nresources. The accessibility of e-learning resources provides additional challenges. While it is impor-\ntant to consider the technical and resource related aspects of e-learning when designing and\ndeveloping resources for students with disabilities, there is a need to consider pedagogic and contex-\ntual issues as well. A holistic framework is therefore proposed and described, which in addition to\naccessibility issues takes into account learner needs, learning outcomes, local factors, infrastructure,\nusability and quality assurance. The practical application and implementation of this framework is\ndiscussed and illustrated through the use of examples and case studies.\nIntroduction\nThe importance of universal accessibility to web resources is widely acknowledged\n(Witt & McDermott, 2002; Kelly et al., 2005a). The Web Accessibility Initiative\n(WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (WC3) has developed guidelines that\nhelp to ensure web resources can be accessed by people with disabilities. With the\nWeb providing the main delivery channel for e-learning resources, it would appear\nthat adhering to the WAI guidelines should be a requirement for e-learning develop-\nment. However, we put the case for a wider perspective that recognises the limitations\nof implementing the WAI guidelines.\nChallenges in implementing the WAI WCAG guidelines\nThe WC3 (the body responsible for the coordination of developments to web stan-\ndards) established the WAI with a remit to lead the Web to its full potential with a\n*Corresponding author. UKOLN, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, UK. \nEmail: B.Kelly@ukoln.ac.uk\n70 L. Phipps and B. Kelly\nparticular reference to promoting a high degree of accessibility for people with disabil-\nities. The WAI has successfully raised awareness of the importance of web accessibil-\nity and developed guidelines that help to ensure web resources are accessible, with the\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (WAI, 1999, 2004) being of partic-\nular relevance to developers of web resources.\nIn 2001 the UK Government introduced the Special Educational Needs and\nDisability Act (HMSO, 2001), bringing the previously excluded elements of the\neducation sector within the remit of existing anti-discrimination legislation. In the\nsame year the Joint Information Systems Committee established the TechDis service\nwith a remit for all aspects of technology and disability within education. Since 2001\nthe service has been working with other intermediaries to try and understand the\nramifications of the legislation for, among other things, e-learning.\nAn excellent overview of the legislation highlighting many of the issues that would\nbe affected by the legislation is given in Willder (2002). However, she concludes that\nuntil the legislation is tested it will be difficult to draw conclusions. Sloan (2002)\nsuggests that there is little doubt that e-learning will be within the scope of UK legis-\nlation: \n[\u2026] it can be seen that there is likely to be a duty on higher and further education institu-\ntions to ensure that their online teaching resources and VLEs are provided in a form acces-\nsible to disabled students. Further, institutions will be expected to make \u2018reasonable\nadjustments\u2019 to overcome these problems and are unlikely to be able to justify continuing\ndiscrimination.\nOver a period of four years the authors have been working together with academic\nstaff and individuals working in the policy area to better understand how standards\nand guidelines fit together with UK legislation, and how that then transposes onto the\nlearning experience of a disabled student in the United Kingdom. In working with\nlearning technologists, disability staff and lecturers, the authors have come to some\ninteresting conclusions and challenges to those who are working in the field of acces-\nsibility. For example, Kelly et al. (2005b) describe some of the experiences of staff\ninvolved in e-learning attempting to map their work onto WCAG guidelines. They\nconclude that while the WCAG guidelines have a very important role to play in the\ncreation of more generic web-based materials, it is difficult to relate the same\napproach to a rich e-learning experience that is accessible to all students. They reflect\nthat the application of guidelines to individual objects can create proble\nA holistic approach\nAs a result of the increasing emphasis on accessibility within higher and further\neducation, accessibility has generally become synonymous with web accessibility or\nthe accessibility of e-learning. However, to staff who are just starting out in educa-\ntional development or using technology in a very iterative way with students, the\napplication of accessibility-related standards and guidelines can be at best a discour-\nagement or at worst damaging, preventing staff from exploring the potential of e-\nlearning (Kelly et al., 2003a, b).\nHolistic approaches to e-learning accessibility 71\nThis approach to accessibility (focusing solely on accessibility guidelines) also\nignores a major facet of the educational experience: it is holistic. Students attend an\ninstitution and partake of a range of facilities and activities\u2014some they will not relate\nto, others they will. Because a disabled student cannot access one type of assessment\nthat happens to be delivered via a web browser, it does not mean they cannot instead\ndo an oral examination in a one-to-one situation. The current accessibility paradigm\nplaces emphasis on total online access or, if materials cannot be made accessible, then\nproviding an equivalent online experience. This can be damaging to the educational\nexperience of attending an institution, ignoring the fact that institutions and their staff\ndeploy a range of learning methods, some of which will suit all students and others\nwill not. Therefore, in our opinion, the only way to judge accessibility of e-learning\nwithin an institution is to assess it holistically and not to judge it by a single method\nof delivery.\nWe propose a holistic approach to supporting the development of e-learning\nresources that addresses the following issues: \n\u25cf usability;\n\u25cf making learning accessible;\n\u25cf making courses accessible; and\n\u25cf adapting to individual, local political and cultural factors.\nUsability issues\nThe Disability Rights Commission (2004) report highlighted the importance of\nwebsite usability for people with disabilities. The report pointed out that: \n45% of [the total 585 accessibility and usability] problems were not a violation of any\n(WAI WCAG) Checkpoint and could therefore have been present on any WAI-conform-\nant site regardless of rating.\nThis point illustrates a limitation of the WAI WCAG guidelines. It should be self-\nevident that quality e-learning web resources should be usable and not just accessible.\nHowever the strong emphasis given to accessibility, especially with concerns some-\ntimes expressed that failure to comply with W3C WAI WCAG guidelines could lead\nto legal action, can lead to failure to give equal weight to usability issues.\nAlthough it might appear desirable to include usability alongside accessibility, there\nis a need to be aware of potential conflicts. This may be partly due to poor support\nfor web standards in browsers. In addition users may express preferences for e-learn-\ning resources, which have conflict with accessibility guidelines. This can be illustrated\nby focusing on the proprietary Flash format, which is widely used for the development\nof interactive e-learning resources and online games. Despite being highly visual,\nFlash resources can be accessible. The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB),\nfor example, has encouraged the development of accessible Flash resources. The\nRNIB (undated) also provide advice on the development of accessible Flash\nresources. Although resources such as the RNIB \u2018Blind Date\u2019 game may be usable\nand accessible, they would not appear to comply with the WAI WCAG guidelines as\n72 L. Phipps and B. Kelly\nthey make use of a proprietary file format, something that the guidelines advise\nagainst.\nAccessible e-learning or accessible learning?\nIn adopting a holistic approach to accessible e-learning we argue that there is a need\nto provide accessible learning experiences, and not necessarily an accessible e-learning\nexperience. This approach has parallels with the concept of blended learning rather\nthan the more limited e-learning approach. As an example, consider an e-learning\nenvironment that provides a highly interactive three-dimensional visualisation of a\nmolecule. Such an environment is likely to be very difficult to make accessible to a\nvisually impaired student or a student with impaired motor skills. Rather than seeking\nto develop an accessible version of such an environment (which, if possible to do, may\nprove costly, without any guarantee that the accessible equivalent will be usable by\nthe student with disabilities), we argue that the teacher should consider the learning\nexperience provided by the e-learning resources and seek to develop an alternative\nthat provides an equivalent learning experience. In many cases it should be possible\nto find an acceptable equivalent learning experience, such as the resources used prior\nto the development of the e-learning resource (e.g. a physical representation of a\nmolecule).\nThis approach may also be used when a real-world learning experience is not acces-\nsible. For example, consider a field course for a geography student, which requires\nclimbing a mountain or other terrain unsuited for a student in a wheelchair or with\nsimilar physical disabilities (this may include an overweight student or a heavy smoker\nwho finds physical exertions difficult). A blinkered approach may seek to make the\nmountain accessible by using expensive all-terrain vehicles, building appropriate\npaths and ramps at key sites or, in the worst-case scenario, cancelling the field trip for\nall students. A holistic approach however, allows the teacher to identify the learning\nexperiences (such as the selection of appropriate sites to take water and soil samples)\nand seek equivalent learning experiences (perhaps providing the student with 3G\nphone technologies, videos, for use in selecting the sites, followed by discussion of the\ntest results with other team members at base camp). This holistic approach to\naccessible learning has been accepted in a number of academic disciplines. For exam-\nple the Virtual Field Course website1 describes several approaches to support field\nstudies for students with disabilities.\nAccessible courses\nA holistic approach encourages a more bird\u2019s eye view of the learning experience\nencountered by disabled students. The learning path that the student chooses to\nfollow should be accessible, while individual online components or learning objects\nmay not. For example, consider a blind student who wishes to take a degree in\nbiochemistry. When choosing a course the student should be advised on course\nmodules that the student\u2019s disability may make it difficult for the student to pass\nHolistic approaches to e-learning accessibility 73\n(such as options that may require a student to peer through a microscope and\ndescribe what they see). Although such courses may not be possible for a blind\nstudent to take, the department could seek to provide accessible alternative course\noptions, which would still allow the student to be awarded a degree.\nAdapting to individual, local, political and cultural factors\nA holistic approach, in our opinion, requires that individual needs and local\ncultural, political and social factors are taken into account. Since accessibility is\nprimarily about people and not about technologies, the authors feel it is inappropri-\nate to seek a universal solution. In seeking to provide accessible learning experiences\nit will be necessary to take into account the individual\u2019s specific needs, institutional\nfactors, the subject discipline and the broader cultural and political factors. Instead\nof aiming to provide an e-learning resource that is accessible to everyone, we argue\nthat there can be advantages in providing resources tailored for the student\u2019s partic-\nular needs.\nThe holistic framework\nOur holistic framework for e-learning accessibility, which has been described\nelsewhere (Kelly et al., 2005c), is illustrated in Figure 1. We have represented our\nFigure 1. A holistic framework for e-learning accessibility\n74 L. Phipps and B. Kelly\nframework as a circle in order to emphasise that the different parts are parts of a\n\u2018whole\u2019. This is central to our argument that the approach to developing accessible\ne-learning needs to be holistic and consider more than the technical accessibility\naspects of the e-learning. Therefore, rather than relying purely on the WAI guidelines,\nthe framework incorporates the guidelines as part of a broader approach to the provi-\nsion of accessible e-learning resources. There is a need to address the usability of\ne-learning resources, the pedagogic aims of the e-learning resources, infrastructural\nand resources issues and to provide solutions that are appropriate to the needs of the\nlearner. This approach needs to be undertaken within a quality assurance framework\nin order to that documented policies are provided and systematic procedures for\nensuring compliance with the policies are implemented.\nFigure 1. A holistic framework for e-learning accessibility\nDiscussion\nIt could be argued that the holistic approach has limitations compared with the W3C\nWAI guidelines. The WAI guidelines can appear easier to implement as they provide\na series of checklists. However, in our opinion, a checklist approach can in fact be\ncounter-productive as it encourages developers to prioritise the objective areas on\nwhich testing tools can easily report. Another limitation of this approach may be its\nlack of universality, which is implicit in its inclusion of local (institutional) factors.\nThis criticism may, in fact, be regarded in some quarters as a strength of the\napproach, as it does not seek to mandate a single global solution, but rather welcomes\ndiversity and a learner-centric approach to e-learning.\nWhile this work has been discussed and revised at length at various workshops and\nconferences, there is still a need to develop the framework and to provide examples\nof how it could be applied in a variety of circumstances, including differing learning\nenvironments, students with a variety of disabilities, use of various technologies and\nin a variety of different organisations.\nOffering solutions: a need for a holistic framework\nAn article (Sitemorse, 2005) published by the accessibility auditing software\ncompany Sitemorse has generated heated debate over the relative merits of auto-\nmated accessibility checking versus manual testing. The article describes the findings\nof an automated analysis carried out by Sitemorse across the websites of various\ndisability organisations within the United Kingdom, including the RNIB, Royal\nNational Institute for Deaf People (RNID) and the Disability Rights Commission,\nand so on. The arguments over the relevance of the findings clearly demonstrate a\nlack of consensus and illustrate the perceived difficulties that even national disability\norganisations find in complying with basic WAI WCAG guidelines. However, the\narticle failed to provide a solution to these conflicts. The holistic framework does\nprovide a resolution to this impasse because it enables those developers (e.g. disability\norganisations) who are targeting specific audiences to demonstrate how their material\nis accessible within the context of learner needs, usability and other local factors.\nHolistic approaches to e-learning accessibility 75\nApplying the holistic approach to the e-learning development cycle\nIn trying to provide pragmatic guidance to practitioners on how to apply the holistic\napproach to their own practices and contexts, what has emerged is a suggested frame-\nwork for developers that could be applied at various points in an e-learning develop-\nment process. What is illustrated in Table 1 is the result of discussions with colleagues\nin both the disability and e-learning areas of education. It is also a \u2018work in progress\u2019\nin that we are not seeking to claim that this is the final answer, but we hope that it\ndoes help contribute to the discussion. The final caveat is that this is designed to be\napplicable to UK education institutions; we are not trying to create a model that will\nfit all areas of e-learning.\nIn using the framework in Table 1, it is suggested that developers document in\nsome way the process as they work through it. This will be useful if challenged,\nbut is also a means of reflecting on the process when undertaking further develop-\nments. \n\u25cf Stage one: awareness. The developer is asked to consider specific issues relating to\nthe development of e-learning material and to consider the needs of disabled\nstudents. For example, it is suggested that, if an online assessment is being created,\nthe developer should be aware that there are issues related to how someone with a\nvision impairment would access it.\n\u25cf Stage two: investigation. The developer, after becoming aware that there may be\nsome issues with the resource, investigates what existing guidelines, \u2018standards\u2019 or\npractices are available that would support the resource under development in\nrelation to inclusion. For example, it may be that the use of W3C guidelines is\napplicable in the creation of some content.\n\u25cf Stage three: understanding. The developer must make a value judgement: are the\npractices identified in stage two valid for the resource under development? Further-\nmore, they must ensure that the application of the guidelines, \u2018standards\u2019 or practices\nTable 1.

This is probably the most important stage to document,\nafter working through the processes and either developing a resource that is \u2018acces-\nsible\u2019 or one that may be inaccessible to some audiences, it may be necessary to\nidentify other ways of achieving the learning objective. For example, a totally inac-\ncessible online assessment, due to the material or system constraints, may be over-\ncome by holding a viva voce for the student, or an inaccessible discussion group\nmay result in a small group discussion with other students. Documenting these\nareas is important to ensure that the developer recognised the issues and began the\nprocess of identifying alternatives or adjustments.\n\u25cf Stage five: evaluation. Evaluation of practice is key in ensuring that the needs of\ndisabled students are met in learning environments. Here it is suggested that not\nonly individual learning outcomes are evaluated, but a wider approach is taken.\nFor example, where a project is funded to provide individual learning objects, it\nshould be evaluated on the whole and not on each product.\nAn example of using the five-stage process\nTo illustrate the five stages and how they can be applied to practice, we offer an exam-\nple of a vision-impaired learner accessing a computer-based assessment (via the\nInternet). In designing the assessment, the staff involved (lecturer\/learning technolo-\ngist) must understand the nature of the difficulty of accessing the material (stage one).\nThis requires the individuals involved looking at and understanding the nature of the\nstudent\u2019s access requirement and what barriers there may be.\nIn stage two, the staff look at existing practices. With little written in the field of\nvision-impaired students accessing computer-based assessment, and the assessment\nbeing delivered via the Internet, it is likely that they will rely on web content accessi-\nbility guidelines (WAI, 1999), as an established maxim for the Web. However, in the\ncase of this assessment a large amount of images are required.\nTherefore, in stage three, the staff must decide whether the existing practice is\napplicable. Clearly the vision-impaired student would find difficulties in accessing the\nimages in an assessment, and using an alternative description for the images part of\nthe assessment may be negated. It may be assumed that the existing practice does not\nsupport the learning outcomes of the assessment or the student.\nStage four asks that an alternative is identified that does allow the student to access\nthe learning and assessment. It may be that the student takes part in a discussion and\ntheir contribution assessed, or that they use tactile diagrams and feel a physical repre-\nsentation of the image.\nFinally, the process should be evaluated in stage five. The evaluation should look\nat the needs of the student, whether the learning outcomes were met, whether the\nstudent was at an advantage or disadvantage over their non-disabled peers and\nwhether the assessment was academically rigorous.\nHolistic approaches to e-learning accessibility 77\nConclusions\nThis paper argues that although the W3C WAI guidelines for content accessibility are\nvaluable, they should not be regarded as the only set of criteria that developers of\ne-learning resources need to consider. Not only is there a need to address a wider set\nof issues than those addressed in the WAI guidelines, there are also other factors that\nneed to be addressed, some of which may conflict with WAI guidelines. In addition\nthere is a need to place the learner at the centre of the development process. This\napproach focuses on the broad learning outcomes and recognises that inaccessible\ne-learning resources may be deployed, provided that disabled learners are still able to\ndemonstrate the required learning outcomes in a way that does not disadvantage\nthem or their non-disabled peers. The authors acknowledge that, in some quarters,\nthese ideas made be regarded as controversial, especially in organisations that have\ndefined e-learning accessibility policies solely using the WAI guidelines. It is also\nrecognised that there is still an on-going debate to be held. The authors welcome\ncomments and input to this debate.\nAcknowledgement\nThis paper is adapted from \u2018Implementing A Holistic Approach To E-Learning\nAccessibility\u2019 (Kelly et al., 2005a), published in the ALT-C Conference 2005\nResearch Paper Proceedings.\nNotes\n1.
