This contrasts with \nrocks erupted at side vents (SVG) on the eastern and western flanks of Salak and with rock \nsuites of most other Javan volcanoes where these elements remain relatively constant with \nincreasing SiO2.

The observed variations in K\/Rb and Ba\/Th ratios and correlation of 87Sr\/86Sr \nwith indices of differentiation necessitate assimilation of a low K\/Rb, low Ba\/Th, Sr-rich \ncontaminant with 87Sr\/86Sr of ~ 0.7048 during fractional crystallisation. For the eastern flank \nSVG, deep fractionation of a phase in which HFSE and HREE are compatible (e.g. \namphibole) is implicated. By extension, this is also suggested to occur beneath the majority of \nJavan volcanoes. Radiogenic isotope ratios (Sr-Hf-Nd) of Salak lavas are similar to other \nJavan lavas.

Therefore elucidating \ncomposition-modifying processes in arc lavas is a prerequisite before the nature, composition \nand components of the source can be determined. Among the variety of processes capable of \nmasking element concentrations of primary magmas, fractional crystallisation, crustal \ncontamination and magma mixing (e.g. Ewart, 1982; Davidson et al., 1987; Hildreth and \nMoorbath, 1988; Tepley et al., 2000) are commonly identified in arc lavas. \nSeparate differentiation trends occur in lavas from within the single volcanic centre at \nSalak Volcano in West Java, and so this volcano provides a great opportunity to study the \nimpact of shallow level processes on the composition of arc lavas. The steeply-sloped, \npositive correlations of HFSE (high field strength elements) and HREE (heavy rare earth \nelements) with indices of differentiation displayed by rocks erupted from the central vent at \nSalak are highly unusual compared to most other Sunda arc volcanic rock suites. This paper \nconstrains the relative importance of various differentiation processes at Salak, in order to \nexplain the abnormal HFSE-HREE differentiation trends displayed by the central vent \neruptive products and their genetic relationship to flank vent volcanic rocks. This information \nis essential before the characteristics of the source can be investigated and it will aid in \nelucidating the nature of crust in West Java, of which relatively little is known. We suggest \nthat fractionation of an (unseen) HFSE-HREE bearing phase plays an  important role in the \nchemical evolution of most Javan island arc magmas. \n \n2. Tectonic setting \n 3\nGunung Salak, 2211m, is a prominent stratovolcano located in the Quaternary volcanic \nfront of the Sunda arc in West Java. The Sunda arc stretches from the Andaman Islands north \nof Sumatra to Flores in the Banda Sea and has developed as a result of the 6-7cm\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n-1 northward \nmigration and consequent subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate \n(Le Pichon, 1968; DeMets et al., 1990; Tregoning et al., 1994). The tectonic features of the \narea have been described in detail by Hamilton (1979). Beneath Java (and Salak) the crust is \n~20 km thick and has a \u2018quasi-continental\u2019 seismic velocity structure, intermediate between \ncontinental and oceanic (Ben-Avraham and Emery, 1973, Curray et al., 1977; Jarrard, 1986). \nFurther east, seismic data indicate that the crust is ~18 km thick near Bali and 5-10 km \nbeneath Flores (Curray et al., 1977). The south-eastern boundary of Sundaland (SE Asian \ncontinental part of the Sunda block\/Eurasian plate with pre-Tertiary basement) is suggested \nby Hamilton (1979) to be located in West Java. However, due to limited knowledge of the \nprecise structure and composition of the Javan crust, the exact location and nature of this \nboundary remain unknown. \n \n3. Geology of Salak and sampling details \nSalak forms the north-eastern part of the Salak-Perbakti-Gagak volcanic massif (Fig. 1), \nwhich consists of Upper Pleistocene to Recent stratovolcanoes, parasitic vents and \nphreatomagmatic craters. The Perbakti-Gagak range to the south-west is strongly eroded. \nBoth areas in the north-east and south-west are sites of extensive hydrothermal activity. \nIntermittent volcanism occurred at Salak between ~0.2 to 1.2 my ago (Stimac, 2003). In \nhistoric time, volcanic activity at Salak has been limited to a number of phreatic explosions \noccurring at side vents on the flanks of the volcano. The summit area of Salak is characterised \nby two large breached craters, one open to the northeast and another to the southwest (Fig. 1), \nwhich are associated with volcanic sector collapse events. The westernmost crater was the \n 4\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nsource of a large debris-avalanche deposit which extends over 10 km from the summit. \nSatellitic cones are mainly found on the south-west flank of Salak and on the northern \nfoothills on the eastern side of the volcano. A late-stage dome built on the western crater rim \nis a result of the most recent activity. \nThe volcanic products of Salak can be divided into two main groups based on eruption \nlocation: those erupted from the central vent (CVG) and those erupted from flank or side \nvents (SVG). The CVG, consisting of multiple lava flows and pyroclastic units, dominates the \nvolcanic deposits at Salak and therefore the majority of samples in this study were collected \nfrom this group (filled circles, Fig. 1). SVG samples S102 and S103 were taken from lava \nflows erupted from a side vent on the eastern slope of Salak. S107A and S107B SVG samples \nare from the western flank. Sampling of SVG products for geochemical analysis on the \nwestern flank was of limited success due to extensive alteration of lava caused by \nhydrothermal activity. Sample S112 is from a lava flow (SL3) thought to originate from the \nmain vent (CVG) (Zaennudin et al., 1993). However, this sample is geochemically similar to \nthe SVG samples in major and trace element composition. This unit extends down the western \nflank of Salak, therefore it is possible that S112 may have been erupted from one of the \nwestern side vents. As a result of uncertainty in the provenance of this sample it is \ndistinguished from the other samples in all diagrams. Two pumice samples collected on the \nwestern slope of Salak (S100 and S101) are from extensive airfall deposits related to pre-\nSalak activity (Zaennudin, et al., 1993). These deposits are overlain by thinner airfall deposits \nfrom Salak. Limited dating has been carried out on Salak-Perbakti-Gagak volcanic products \n(Stimac, 2003). Reliance on geological maps and relative stratigraphy in this study limits a \ndetailed temporal evaluation of Salak lavas and therefore this is not carried out here. \n \n4. Analytical techniques \n 5\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nMineral analyses were performed on carbon-coated polished slides of selected Salak \nvolcanic rocks using a Cameca SX 100 at the University of Manchester NERC facility. The \naccelerating voltage was 15kV and beam current was 2nA. Detection limits (wt%) for Al, Mg, \nK, Ca, Ti are 0.01 or lower, Na, Si, Cr, Ni are around 0.03, while Fe is slightly higher around \n0.08. Element precision is dependant on the mineral being analysed, but was typically less \nthan 1% for Ca, Ti, Si, Al and Mg, between 1-2% for Fe, 2.7% for Ni and around 4% for Na, \nK, Mn and Cr. \nMajor element contents of Salak whole-rock samples were determined on fused glass discs \nproduced by the Fusion method (spectroflux 105) using the Automated Philips PW2404 X-ray \nfluorescence spectrometer at the University of Edinburgh. In-house rock standards were used \nto calibrate the machine and monitor accuracy and precision during analysis. \nTrace element concentrations of Salak rock powders were determined on the PerkinElmer \nELAN 6000 quadrupole ICP-MS at Durham University following the analytical procedure \nand instrument operating conditions described by Ottley et al. (2003). Multiple analyses of \nprocedural blanks (3 per batch), in-house standards and international reference materials: W2, \nBHVO-1, AGV1, BE-N and BIR1 during each session e.g. at the start, mid-way, and at the \nend of a run, allowed any drift in the instrument calibration to be detected. Reproducibility \n(internal and external) of standard values on the ELAN were less than 5% relative standard \ndeviation. \nPreparation of whole rock powders for Sr, Nd and Hf isotope analysis was undertaken in \nthe Arthur Holmes Isotope Geology Laboratory (AHIGL) at Durham University. The sample \ndissolution procedure and chemical separation of Hf and Nd from rock samples is based on \nthat presented by Dowall et al. (2003). The separation procedure for Sr follows that detailed \nby Charlier et al. (2006) except Sr was collect from the column in 300 \u00b5L MQ (rather than \n0.05M HNO3) followed by addition of 15 \u00b5L 10M HNO3 to the collected Sr fraction. Sr, Nd \n 6\nand Hf isotope ratios were determined on the AHIGL ThermoElectron Neptune Multi-\ncollector Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS).  Details of instrument operating \nconditions are presented in Nowell et al. (2003) and Dowall et al. (2003). Instrumental mass \nbias was corrected for using a \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n88Sr\/86Sr ratio of 8.375209 (the reciprocal of the 86Sr\/88Sr ratio \nof 0.1194), 146Nd\/145Nd ratio of 2.079143 (equivalent to the more commonly used 146Nd\/144Nd \nratio of 0.7219) and 179Hf\/177Hf ratio of 0.7325 plus an exponential law. Data quality was \nmonitored over several analytical sessions by regular analysis of standard reference materials \nduring each run. The reproducibility of the 87Sr\/86Sr, 143Nd\/144Nd and 176Hf\/177Hf ratios for the \nrespective standard solutions in each of the individual analytical sessions are better than 21 \nppm in all cases. Sr-Nd-Hf isotope data presented are plotted relative to NBS 987, J&M and \nJMC 475 standard values of 0.71024  (Thirlwall, 1991), 0.511110 (Royse et al., 1998) and \n0.282160 (Nowell, et al., 1998) respectively. Blank samples processed (at least 2 per sample \nbatch) were analysed by ICP-MS on the PerkinElmer ELAN 6000 quadrupole at Durham \nUniversity. Total analytical blanks for Sr, Nd and Hf were below 1.2 ng for Sr (typically < \n300 pg), 219 pg for Nd and 73 pg for Hf. These values are insignificant considering the \nquantity of Sr, Nd and Hf processed from the volcanic rocks (12-65 \u03bcg, 2-7 \u03bcg and 0.5-1.2 \u03bcg \nrespectively). \nOxygen isotope analyses of mineral separates (~10mg per sample) were determined by \nlaser-fluorination at Royal Holloway, University of London; using an analytical procedure \nfollowing that of Macpherson et al. (2000). In-house standard values of SC olivine 2 and \nGMG II during the period of study were within 0.01\u2030 of accepted values: +5.24\u2030 \u00b1 0.04 \n(1\u03c3, n = 6) and +5.69\u2030 \u00b1 0.08 (1\u03c3, n = 15), respectively. Oxygen yields were slightly low, \nbut consistent over the individual sessions: 93% for plagioclase (n = 7) and between 92-94% \n(n = 20) for clinopyroxene. Replicate analyses of plagioclase and clinopyroxene throughout \n 7\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthe study were within 0.09\u2030 and 0.04\u2030 respectively. Oxygen results are reported as per \nmille deviations relative to the standard mean ocean water (V-SMOW) standard. \n \n5. Petrology and mineral chemistry \nModal analyses of Salak lavas and representative mineral compositions are given in Tables \n1 and 2-5, respectively. Andesites are the most common rock type sampled at Salak. The \nandesites of the SVG are generally more phenocryst rich than those of the CVG with total \nphenocryst abundances ranging between ~50-60 % and 20-46 % (modal volume), respectively \n(Table 1). Both andesite groups contain a typically observed island-arc mineral assemblage of \nplagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxide. Basaltic-andesites of the CVG \ncontain olivine phenocrysts, which commonly occur with both clinopyroxene and \northopyroxene (indicating magmatic disequilibrium in the latter case). The olivine \nphenocrysts (Fo54-66, Table 2) are generally small and subhedral, some showing slight \nalteration to iddingsite at crystal edges. The SVG rhyolite and Pre-Salak pumice samples are \ndominated by glassy groundmass and phenocrysts of plagioclase with minor pyroxene. Small \namounts of amphibole and quartz \u00b1 biotite are also present (Table 1). \nOrthopyroxene phenocrysts in the basaltic-andesites of the CVG are mostly subhedral-\neuhedral and infrequently contain smaller inclusions of early-formed olivine (S104). In some \nbasaltic-andesites (S104, S105 and S108) the orthopyroxene phenocrysts are surrounded by a \nthin rim, or jacket of clinopyroxene. This disequilibrium feature appears to be relatively \ncommon in arc lavas and has been observed in the volcanic products of several Javan \nvolcanoes: Ijen (Sitorus, 1990), Slamet (Vukadinovic and Sutawidjaja, 1995), Lamongan \n(Carn and Pyle, 2001) and Gede (Handley, 2006). Mineralogically, clinopyroxene and \northopyroxene in the basaltic andesites of the CVG lack evidence for compositional \ndisequilibrium, displaying normal zoning of phenocrysts from Mg-rich cores towards more \n 8\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nFe-rich rims. Orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene compositions available for the andesites show \nslightly more variation in the SVG than the CVG (Figs. 2a & b). The limited pyroxene \nanalyses available for the SL3 lava show restricted compositional variation (Fig. 2c). \nPlagioclase is the most abundant phenocryst phase in all CVG and SVG rocks. Plagioclase \nphenocrysts exhibit a wide range in composition in the basaltic-andesites of the CVG (Figs. \n3a & b; Table 4), with plagioclase rims displaying the largest variation in anorthite content \n(An58-91). Phenocryst interiors are more restricted in composition and have fairly high An \ncontents (above 80). The An contents of several plagioclase rims are higher than those in \nrespective groundmass plagioclase (< An55) indicating that not all phenocrysts were in \nequilibrium with the host liquid. Disequilibrium textures of plagioclase phenocrysts \n(oscillatory zoning, sieve textures and infrequent resorbed cores) are observed in all CVG \nbasaltic-andesite samples. CVG and SVG andesites display similar compositional ranges in \nplagioclase (Table 4). In the CVG (Fig. 3c) plagioclase phenocryst and groundmass \ncompositions are extremely homogeneous (An48-59) with the exception of one core analysis \n(An72). The SVG plagioclases display a slightly wider compositional range and often the core \nsections possess lower anorthite contents than respective mid and rim sections (Fig. 3e). Sieve \ntextures and oscillatory zoning are common in plagioclase phenocrysts of both groups of \nandesites. The SL3 andesite displays a fairly restricted range in plagioclase composition \n(An54-68) similar to the andesite analysed from the CVG (Fig. 3d). Some SL3 plagioclase \nphenocrysts show reverse zoning from less An-rich cores to more An-rich rims. \nFe-Ti oxide (titanomagnetite) occurs as a phenocryst phase in all rocks and is often \nassociated with the other mafic phases, commonly occurring as inclusions within pyroxene, or \nforming a glomerocrystic texture with pyroxene. Titanomagnetite is slightly more Ti-rich in \nthe CVG andesite compared to the SVG andesite (Table 5). \n 9\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nCognate xenoliths  are observed in SVG samples from the eastern flank unit, PD1 (S102 \nand S103), displaying sharp contacts with the surrounding lava. The xenoliths are composed \nof heavily sieve-textured and oscillatory-zoned plagioclase phenocrysts, clinopyroxene, \northopyroxene and Fe-Ti oxide phenocrysts (titanomagnetite and ilmenite; in close \nassociation with ferromagnesian minerals) set in a medium-grained groundmass. The \ngroundmass is dominated by euhedral plagioclase laths, elongate acicular pyroxene, small \noxide crystals and minor devitrified glass. Clinopyroxene occasionally forms thick jackets \naround orthopyroxene phenocrysts. Fig. 2b shows there is some overlap in clinopyroxene and \northopyroxene compositions between the xenolith (black crosses) and the host rock (open \nsquares). However, orthopyroxene phenocrysts in the xenolith also contain significantly more \nEn-rich compositions. Plagioclase compositions in the xenolith (Fig. 3f) are scattered, but \ngenerally more An-rich than those in the host lava (Fig. 3e). \n \n6. Geochemistry \n6.1. Major and trace element variations \nMajor and trace element data are reported in Table 6. Salak lavas are relatively evolved, \nwith MgO contents less than 4 wt %. Salak volcanic rocks display negative correlations on \ndiagrams of Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO and CaO against SiO2, and positive correlations between \nSiO2 and both K2O and Na2O (Fig. 4), although Na2O contents in the SVG are relatively \nconstant with increasing SiO2. TiO2 and P2O5 variation is split into two markedly different \ntrends. Lavas erupted from the CVG generally show an increase in TiO2 and P2O5 contents \nwith increasing SiO2, whereas SVG lavas possess lower TiO2 and P2O5 contents and plot \nwithin the field of other Javan volcanic rocks (Figs. 4g and h). TiO2 and P2O5 contents \nmeasured in the more evolved CVG rocks (~60% SiO2) are unusually high (up to 1.18 and \n0.48 wt%, respectively) when compared to the majority of values reported for other Javan \n 10\nlavas (Fig. 4g) and from volcanic rocks of other island arc systems at comparable silica \ncontent e.g. Kermadec (Gamble et al., 1993; Ewart et al., 1994; Turner et al., 1997), Lesser \nAntilles (Thirlwall et al., 1996; Zellmer et al., 2003) and Mariana (Woodhead, 1989; Elliot et \nal., 1997). Increasing TiO\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n2 content with increasing silica (Fig. 4g) is not normally observed in \narc andesites, most probably due to the early fractionation of magnetite (Gill, 1981; Pearce, \n1982). \nThe high field strength elements (HFSE) and the rare earth elements (REE), particularly \nthe heavy REE, also show abnormally high concentrations in the more evolved CVG samples \n(Y = 32-69 ppm; Yb, 3-6.5 ppm) and display strikingly positively-sloped, linear trends on \nSiO2 variation diagrams (Figs. 5a and b). This contrasts again with the SVG rocks and the \nmajority of other volcanic rock suites of Java, where concentrations remain relatively constant \nwith increasing SiO2 (Figs. 5a and b). High concentrations of TiO2, P2O5, Y and systematic \nincreases of these elements with SiO2 are so far only evident at one other volcano in Java, \nnamely Tengger Caldera in East Java (Figs. 4g and h and 5a). This unusual feature was not \nnoted in the study of Tengger Caldera by van Gerven and Pichler (1995). Extensive \ncomparisons of trace element variations between Tengger Caldera and Salak are however \nrestricted due to the limited geochemical data available for the former volcanic system. In \ncontrast to the separate HSFE and REE variation trends displayed by the CVG and SVG, \nvariations in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) are similar, displaying positive correlations \nwith SiO2 (Figs. 5e and f). Sr generally decreases as SiO2 increases within each group (Fig. \n5g). The SVG rocks containing around 60 wt% SiO2 are slightly displaced below the main \nSalak trend in the majority of these diagrams with the exception of Sr, where they sit at \nslightly elevated values. \nChondrite normalised REE patterns of selected Salak lavas are displayed in Fig. 6. Salak \nvolcanic rocks are enriched in the light REE compared to mid-ocean ridge basalts (Normal-\n 11\nMORB and Indian Ocean-MORB). With the exception of the high silica rhyolite, the heavier \nREE show concentrations more similar to those in MORB than the light REE. The higher \nsilica CVG andesite is located parallel to, but at higher REE concentrations than the less \nevolved CVG rock. The enrichment of the REE in the evolved CVG sample is made clear \nwhen compared to a SVG rock of comparable silica content (unfilled squares). Strong \ndepletions are observed in the middle to heavy REE concentrations of the high SiO\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n2 (west \nflank) SVG rocks, compared to less evolved Salak rocks. \n \n6.2. Radiogenic isotopes \nSr, Nd and Hf isotope data are presented in Table 6 and shown in Figs. 7 and 8. 87Sr\/86Sr \nand 143Nd\/144Nd isotope ratios of Salak volcanic rocks define a negative array, lying within \nthe field of previously published Java data. Salak exhibits a relatively wide range in 87Sr\/86Sr \nratios, 0.704262 to 0.705051, although the majority of the lavas are more tightly constrained \nwithin the range 0.704569-0.705051. The two SVG samples, S102 and S103, erupted on the \neastern flank of Salak are displaced from the rest of the Salak lavas, possessing significantly \nlower 87Sr\/86Sr and higher 143Nd\/144Nd ratios (Fig. 7 inset). In Hf-Nd isotope space (Fig. 8), \nSalak volcanic rocks also lie within the field defined by Java, possessing lower 143Nd\/144Nd \nand 176Hf\/177Hf isotope ratios than MORB, and higher ratios than Indian Ocean sediments. \nThe eastern-flank SVG samples, S102 and S103, possess significantly more primitive \n176Hf\/177Hf isotope ratios compared to the other Salak lavas (Fig. 8 inset). \n \n6.3. Stable isotope data \nOxygen isotope data from mineral separates are presented in Table 7. The restricted \nclinopyroxene and plagioclase analyses of Salak lavas have low \u03b418O values ranging from \n+5.18 to +5.44\u2030 (n = 3) and +5.96 to +6.07\u2030 (n = 4), respectively. The former values are \n 12\nsimilar to mantle clinopyroxene \u03b418O values reported by Mattey et al. (1994) and Ionov et al. \n(1994): +5.57 \u00b1 0.32\u2030 and similar to or slightly lower than those reported from other \nvolcanoes in Java (Galunggung, Harmon and Gerbe, 1992; Gede Volcanic Complex, \nHandley, 2006; Ijen Volcanic Complex, Handley et al., 2007). Plagioclase \u03b4\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n18O values of \nSalak are generally higher than those of Galunggung (+5.6 to +6.0\u2030, Harmon and Gerbe, \n1992), but lower than those analysed in Merapi volcanics (+6.5 to +7.00\u2030, Gertisser and \nKeller, 2003a). Differences in \u03b418O values between coexisting plagioclase and clinopyroxene \n(\u0394plag-cpx) are between 0.63 to 0.79\u2030 and suggest most of the mineral pairs record oxygen \nisotopic equilibrium at typical magmatic temperatures for andesite liquids. The limited \nnumber of analyses from Salak prohibits intra-group comparisons of \u03b418O data, however, the \nlowest \u03b418O clinopyroxene value is measured in the sample with the most primitive radiogenic \nisotope ratios (SVG, S103). \n \n7. Discussion \nMinor and trace element variations at Salak are intriguing, and raise two important \nquestions: 1) Why do the CVG display atypical differentiation trends and unusually high \nconcentrations in minor and trace elements, in particular for the HREE, Y, TiO2 and P2O5 \ncompared to other Javan volcanoes? 2) Why are there strikingly different differentiation \ntrends in lavas from a single volcanic centre?  \nAssuming that variations in the silica content of volcanic rocks are generated as a result of \ndifferentiation of magma (Gill, 1981; Davidson et al., 2005), systematic increases of Y, Yb, \nTiO2 and P2O5 with SiO2 within the CVG (Figs. 5a & b and Figs. 4g & h, respectively) are \ncompelling evidence for geochemical variation being imparted during differentiation in the \ncrust e.g. through magma mixing, fractional crystallisation and\/or combined assimilation and \nfractional crystallisation. \n 13\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n7.1. Differentiation in the Central Vent Group \n7.1.1. Magma Mixing \nMagma mixing is identified as an important composition-modifying process within the \nevolution of many arc magmas (e.g. Conrad et al., 1983; Tepley et al., 2000) including some \nSunda arc magmas (Slamet, Reubi et al., 2002; Merapi, Gertisser and Keller, 2003b; Batur, \nReubi and Nicholls, 2004). Linear correlations displayed by the CVG rocks on bivariate \nelement-silica diagrams (Figs. 4 and 5) suggest that chemical variation within this group may \nbe explained by the interaction and mixing of chemically distinct magmas. Phenocryst \ntextures and mineral disequilibria in CVG lavas (section 5) indicate that open system \nprocesses may have occurred at one or several points in the magmatic evolution of the CVG. \nA purely geochemical approach to evaluate mixing processes utilises element ratios \n(Langmuir et al., 1978; Vogel, 1982; Flood et al., 1989). Magma mixing should produce \nhyperbolic arrays in plots of a trace element ratio versus a concentration. Figs. 9a and b show \nthat the CVG data largely define a curved array on some element-ratio diagrams. K\/Rb and \nBa\/Th ratios were chosen as these ratios correlate with SiO2 and display a wide range in the \nCVG. The former ratio is also a potentially useful monitor of crust-magma interaction \n(Davidson, 1987, Hildreth & Moorbath, 1988), providing that the melt and crust have \ndistinctive values for the ratio. K\/Rb and Ba\/Th ratios are plotted against Rb (which \nrepresents the degree of magmatic differentiation) and Yb (to check whether the model can \naccount for the highly unusual variations in concentrations observed for this element). The \nresults of bulk-mixing calculations between one of the least evolved CVG samples (S106B) \nand several end members are shown in Figs. 9a and b. If element variation in the CVG is a \nresult of simple mixing, the other end member must be more evolved (higher SiO2) in \ncomposition. Granite xenoliths found within a deposit of cream tuff in the Perbakti-Gagak \n 14\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \narea adjacent to Salak provide evidence for the presence of evolved, granitic material (Stimac, \n2003) in West Java. No data are available from this granite for use in modelling, therefore the \nmore evolved end member magmas in mixing calculations are represented by a rhyolite from \nSalak (S107A) and by arc-related granites from some of the southern-most plutonics in \nSumatra (i.e. close to West Java): monzodiorite (75413) and granodiorite (75415) (Gasparon, \n1993). Mixing with a more basic end member (tholeiitic lava) from Guntur in West Java \n(Edwards, 1990) is also shown for comparison. The end member compositions used in mixing \ncalculations are given in Table 8. \nFig. 9a shows that mixing in K\/Rb-Rb space between S106B and a granitic sample with a \nhigh K\/Rb ratio (MM D) is unable to generate a mixing curve to fit the CVG data. Similar \nunsatisfactory mixing trends would result from mixing with bulk upper-crustal material, \nwhich also has relatively high K\/Rb (~250; Taylor, 1977). Mixing between S106B and \ngranodiorite (MM B) or Javan tholeiite (MM C) also fail to fit the data, generating curves that \nhave a large decrease and increase (respectively) in K\/Rb ratio, with only a small change in \nRb. The mixing curve produced using the Salak rhyolite (MM A) as the evolved end member, \nproduces the best fit to the CVG data. Fig. 9b, Ba\/Th-Yb, shows mixing curves generated \nbetween the same end members in Fig. 9a. Mixing in all cases is inadequate in explaining the \nSalak CVG data due to the low Yb content of the end members chosen. Low Yb contents of \nbasic and evolved Javan lavas and evolved Sumatran plutonics, suggests that Yb contents of \nthe CVG cannot be explained by simple mixing. \n \n7.1.2. Fractional crystallisation \nFractional crystallisation was modelled by least squares analysis of Salak major element \ndata using the XLFRAC programme (Stormer and Nicholls, 1978; Table 9). The results \nsuggest that the most evolved CVG lava can be produced by fractionation of the least evolved \n 15\nCVG lava by 61% crystallisation (\u03a3r2 = 0.13; model 1). Smaller values of \u03a3r2 are obtained in \nmodels to less differentiated final lavas (models 2 & 3), regardless of whether orthopyroxene \nor olivine is included in the mineral assemblage (compare models 3 & 4). This suggests that \nmajor and minor element variation within the CVG can be explained by fractional \ncrystallisation of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxide +\/- olivine and orthopyroxene (e.g. \nFigs. 4g and h). But, can fractional crystallisation explain the unusual trace element variation \ntrends not seen in the majority of Javan lavas using the same mineral assemblage? \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nY and the REE often behave as incompatible elements in primitive arc tholeiites, however \nthey usually remain constant or decrease in concentration with increasing magmatic \nfractionation in the calc-alkaline series, where they can be accommodated within amphibole, \napatite and zircon (Pearce, 1982). This is exemplified by the Java data in Figs. 4g and h, and \namphibole fractionation curves in Figs. 5a and b. To examine whether fractional \ncrystallisation can produce the large increases in Y, Yb and Ti of the CVG (over a relatively \nnarrow range in silica) and test the conclusions of least squares analysis, simple calculations \nwere made using the Rayleigh fractionation equation: Cl = Co F(D-1) where Cl is the \nconcentration of an element in the liquid, Co is the concentration of an element in the original \nliquid, F is the fraction of liquid remaining and D is the bulk distribution coefficient. The \ndegree of fractionation (F) and the phase proportions used are those suggested by major \nelement modelling (Table 9, model 1). The distribution coefficients used are given in Table \n10. Calculated Ti, Y and Yb compositions expected in the daughter rocks (Table 10, Figs. 4g, \n5a and b) show that incompatible behaviour of HFSE and HREE during fractional \ncrystallisation can account for the high concentrations of these elements in Salak rocks. In all \nthree models in Table 10 the concentrations predicted in the daughter rocks are higher than \nthose actually measured. This contrasts with the results of mixing (Fig. 9b) between a basic \nCVG rock and the tholeiitic and more evolved volcanic and plutonic samples, which were \n 16\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nunsuccessful in accounting for high Yb concentrations. Fractional crystallisation curves (FC) \nare shown on K\/Rb-Rb and Ba\/Th-Yb diagrams (Figs. 9a and b) for removal of the same \nmineral assemblage used above. It should be noted that an identical FC curve is produced if \nthe modal mineral assemblage of S106B (Table 1) is used instead. The Salak CVG data \ndiverge from the calculated FC curve towards lower K\/Rb and Ba\/Th, thus suggesting that \npure closed-system fractional crystallisation cannot explain all of the geochemical variation \nobserved in the CVG lavas. \n \n7.1.3. Assimilation and Fractional Crystallisation (AFC) \nAFC processes are recognised in the evolution of magma in arc settings (Davidson et al., \n1987; Hildreth and Moorbath, 1988; Davidson and Harmon, 1989) and have been suggested \nfor the Sunda arc (Gasparon et al., 1994). Little is known about the nature and composition of \nthe crust in West Java. Seismic velocities suggest that the crust in West Java is thicker than \nthat at the eastern end of Java (Ben-Avraham and Emery, 1973; Curray et al., 1977; \nKieckhefer et al., 1980) and in West Java the arc may be built on continental material, i.e. \nSundaland pre-Tertiary basement (Hamilton, 1979). Large granite blocks found in a tuff \ndeposit in the vicinity of Salak (Perbakti-Gagak area, Fig. 1) display partially melted margins \nwith adhering rhyolitic lava (Stimac, 2003). It is unknown when this granite was emplaced in \nthe crust, but it suggests that interaction and possible contamination of magma by evolved \nplutonic rocks may occur at Salak. AFC curves are shown on Figs. 9a and b for contamination \nof the most basic Salak magma, by evolved volcanic (AFC A) and plutonic (AFC B) rocks, \npossessing low K\/Rb and Ba\/Th ratios. These curves fit the array of Salak data well, even \nthough the contaminants possess low Yb concentrations (cf. mixing) Assimilation of upper \nand bulk crust (e.g. Taylor, 1977; Sumatran granitoid 75413) would generate concave-down \nAFC curves, inconsistent with the CVG data. It was suggested by Hamilton (1979) that the \n 17\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncrust in West Java is not truly silicic in character and may consist of older volcanic-arc rocks \nand ophiolite slivers. However, AFC models involving basic arc rocks (e.g. Fig. 9 AFC C) \nand a range of basic and ophiolite compositions (see below) are also inconsistent with the \nCVG array. \nIn summary, major and trace element modelling suggests that the unusual increases in \nHFSE and HREE with increasing SiO2 are created due to incompatible behaviour of these \nelements during fractional crystallisation. Systematic variations in some trace element ratios \n(K\/Rb and Ba\/Th) and disequilibrium textures observed in the rocks indicate that assimilation \nof a contaminant with low K\/Rb and Ba\/Th ratios occurs during fractional crystallisation in \nthe crust. \n \n7.1.4. Isotopic constraints \nContinental-type crustal rocks commonly have elevated 87Sr\/86Sr isotope ratios compared \nto Quaternary volcanic rocks and mantle-derived magmas. Assimilation of crust during \ncrystal fractionation (DePaolo, 1981) in arc magmas may therefore cause modification to the \nisotope ratios in resultant lavas. Consequently, a plot of Sr isotope ratio against an index of \ndifferentiation, e.g. SiO2, can be used to detect AFC processes, in cases where the crust being \nassimilated is isotopically distinct. Even though the number of samples with isotope data is \nrelatively limited and the variation in 87Sr\/86Sr of the CVG is small, the more evolved CVG \nsamples display generally higher 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (Fig. 10), and the data patterns observed in \nthis plot are identical (though the inverse) to those of Ba\/Th with SiO2 (see inset to Fig. 10). \nThis suggests that Ba\/Th, for which there is more data compared to 87Sr\/86Sr, might serve as a \nproxy for isotopic composition. The roughly hyperbolic trend observed in Fig. 10 and \nvariation in 87Sr\/86Sr isotope ratio with SiO2 in the CVG further support control by \ndifferentiation, and more specifically by AFC processes. \n 18\nThe five CVG data points define a concave-down hyperbola on Ba\/Th versus 87Sr\/86Sr (Fig. \n11). The AFC curves displayed here are for the same AFC end members used in trace element \nmodelling (see Fig. 9 caption for details). Neither model on Fig. 11 using evolved volcanic \nnor plutonic rocks produces hyperbolic curves to fit the CVG data. AFC curves for these \nmodels largely follow the same vertical trend shown by fractionation crystallisation (FC) \nalone (arrow, Fig. 11), and altering the rate ratio of mass assimilated to mass crystallised (r) \nhas little effect on the shape of the curve. The basic contaminant (see captions to Figs. 9 and \n10 for details) produces an AFC curve (C) with a much better fit to the CVG data, but \nsuggests a large amount of contamination is required compared to crystallisation (r = 0.8). \nSuch high AFC r-values are not unreasonable and have been proposed for differentiation of \nbasalts at Jebel Marra volcano in Sudan (Davidson and Wilson, 1989) and by Bourdon et al. \n(1998) for the Grande Comore volcanics.  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nA contaminant with a significantly higher Sr content than that of the parental rock would \nbe able to generate a hyperbola curving in the required direction from the parental \ncomposition of S106B and not necessitate such a high r-value.  Fig. 10 also indicates this as \nassimilation of a contaminant with low Sr concentration would produce a concave-up curve \ninitially projecting in a horizontal direction away from the least evolved CVG sample, which \nis inconsistent with the concave-down data array in Fig. 10. The apparent plateau in 87Sr\/86Sr \nisotope ratio in SiO2-rich CVG rocks suggests that the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of the contaminant is \nasymptotic to the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of the more evolved CVG samples (i.e. ~0.7048). If the \ndistribution coefficient for Sr in plagioclase is greater than one, then a magma crystallising \nthis phase would become progressively more sensitive to Sr in the contaminant (which is \nassumed to be fixed). The more AFC magma endures, the more isotopically sensitive to the \ncontaminant it would become, and therefore, for a given shift in silica the magma would \nobtain a larger shift in 87Sr\/86Sr isotope ratio if the contaminant had a higher 87Sr\/86Sr ratio. \n 19\nConsequently, it is argued that if the data are consistent with AFC, the contaminant has a high \nSr concentration and Sr-isotope ratio ~0.7048 (curved arrow, Fig. 10) contamination by a high \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n87Sr\/86Sr component would result in a data array with a steeper positive correlation on Fig. 10 \n(diagonal arrow). The moderate decrease in Sr concentration with increasing SiO2 in the CVG \n(despite the modelled involvement of large amounts of plagioclase fractionation) further \nargues for a high-Sr assimilant. An AFC calculation using S106B as the parent magma and \nthe Sumatran granodiorite as the contaminant suggest that to produce a concave-down \nhyperbola to fit the data in Fig. 11 an extremely unrealistic Sr concentration in the \ncontaminant of >7000 ppm is required. Evolved volcanic or plutonic contaminant end \nmembers are unlikely to possess higher Sr concentrations than the basaltic andesite S106B \nbeing contaminated as Sr content generally decreases with differentiation in arc-related \nigneous rocks due to plagioclase fractionation. Incorporation of the assimilant as a partial melt \n(0.1 - 10% melting), rather than bulk addition of this component, does not increase the Sr \nconcentration sufficiently enough to improve the fit of the models for Ba\/Th versus Sr isotope \nratio and also leads to a more rapid decrease in Ba\/Th ratio, creating an AFC trend further \naway from the CVG array. \nIf Sr isotope variation in the CVG is controlled by AFC processes as suggested above, then \nthe contaminant is characterised by high Sr concentration, 87Sr\/86Sr isotope ratio of around \n0.7048 and low K\/Rb and Ba\/Th ratios (< ~110 and < ~45, respectively). Table 11 shows \ntrace element data and Sr-isotope ratios for a variety of rocks that may represent the West \nJavan crust and could therefore be potential contaminants. However, none of the samples \nlisted possess all of the required criteria envisaged for the contaminant, therefore at present, a \nsuitable contaminant is unidentified. \n \n 20\n7.2. Relationship of the SVG to the CVG 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nIf increases in HFSE and HREE with increasing silica in CVG rocks can be explained by \nhighly incompatible behaviour during differentiation, then relatively low and decreasing \nHFSE and HREE concentrations in the SVG lavas may indicate relatively more compatible \nbehaviour of these elements during differentiation of SVG magmas. A distinct difference in \nthe type or abundance of phases crystallising from the magma may therefore be expected. \nHowever, there is little difference between the mineralogies of the CVG and the eastern flank \nSVG volcanic rocks. In contrast, the western flank SVG samples have small amounts of \namphibole (hornblende) in their modal mineralogies (Table 1). Strong depletions in HREE \nand the steep decrease from La-Sm shown by the western flank SVG samples, relative to \nthose with lower silica content from the eastern flank (Fig. 6), suggests that very late-stage \nfractionation of hornblende (\u00b1 accessory phases) may account for the relatively low HREE \nand HFSE concentrations in these highly evolved samples (cf. deep, early-stage \nfractionation). The similarly shaped REE profiles and modal mineralogies of the CVG and \nSVG lavas with <70 wt % SiO2 precludes a similar explanation for the differences observed \nin the geochemistry of these samples. \nIn addition to mineralogical differences, isotopic differences also occur between the \nwestern and eastern flank SVG lavas (Figs. 7 and 8 insets). The western vent SVG rocks are \nisotopically similar to the CVG group and may, therefore, be genetically related to each other, \nsharing a similar source and evolutionary history. The notably more primitive radiogenic \nisotope ratios of the eastern flank SVG lavas suggest that they may have evolved from an \nisotopically distinct source, or may represent the least contaminated (either by arc crust or a \nsubduction component) Salak lava. In the latter case, they reveal the best estimate of least \nmodified mantle wedge isotopic composition beneath Salak. The similar REE patterns of the \nlower SiO2 SVG and lower SiO2 CVG lavas (Fig. 6), suggests the magmatic source region of \n 21\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthe two groups probably contained a comparable mineralogy and underwent similar degrees \nof melting. \nTrace element ratios of HFSE and HREE (e.g. Zr\/Nb, Y\/Nb) are often used to investigate \nthe source characteristics of magmas (McCulloch and Gamble, 1991; Woodhead et al., 1993; \nReubi and Nichols, 2004). However, the limited number of samples from the SVG, combined \nwith the relatively differentiated nature of all Salak lavas and the uncertainty of HFSE\/HREE \nconcentrations in less differentiated samples (due to unusual increases of these elements in the \nCVG) hampers this approach at Salak \nA schematic diagram showing the proposed evolution of magma beneath Salak is displayed \nin Fig. 12. Petrographic and radiogenic isotope data suggest that the high SiO2 SVG rocks \nfrom the western flank vent may be related to the CVG lavas, evolving to lower HFSE and \nREE concentrations due to prolonged residence in the crust and the late-stage fractionation of \nhornblende (\u00b1 accessory phases) prior to eruption (A). However, the lower SiO2 (and \nisotopically more primitive) eastern SVG lavas are proposed to have taken a separate \nevolutionary pathway to the surface. Low concentrations of HFSE and HREE in these \nsamples may be the result of fractionation of a HFSE-REE-compatible phase at depth (B), \nsuch as amphibole, which effectively inhibits the relative increase of these elements during \nfractional crystallisation at shallower levels. A number of factors control amphibole \nfractionation from magma (see Davidson et al. 2007 for a recent discussion), which include \nthe water content of the magma and also the pressure of crystallisation. Therefore, an apparent \nlack of deep-seated amphibole crystallisation in the CVG may imply that the water content \nwas not as great in the parental magma, or CVG magmas were not stored at deeper levels in \nthe arc crust. Other arc studies that support a proposal of multiple independent conduits and \nreservoirs in the crust beneath active volcanoes include those of Reubi and Nicholls (2004) \nand Grove et al. (2005). \n 22\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nWithin andesitic volcanic rock suites REE concentrations commonly increase with silica \n(Gill, 1981). Therefore, due to the relatively constant within suite REE concentrations (black \ncrosses, Figs. 5b and h) and general lack of hornblende phenocrysts in Javan volcanic rocks, \nwe speculate that amphibole, or other HFSE-HREE bearing phase, may fractionate at depth \nbelow most Javan volcanoes. Although amphibole-bearing xenoliths have not been found in \nSalak lavas, gabbroic xenoliths with variable amphibole contents are observed in lavas \nerupted at Sangeang Api volcano in the East Sunda arc (Turner et al., 2003) and gabbroic \nmafic inclusions composed of plagioclase and amphibole are present in lavas at Merapi \nvolcano in Central Java (Camus et al., 2000). \n \n8. Conclusions \nUnusual HFSE and HREE variation trends (compared to most other volcanic rocks from \nJava) displayed by the CVG lavas of Salak are produced during differentiation in the crust. \nDifferentiation processes have been modelled to show that: 1) CVG element variation is not \nconsistent with simple mixing due to the low HFSE and HREE concentrations found in \ncontinental and oceanic crustal end members. 2) Evolution to high HFSE and HREE \nconcentrations in the CVG can be explained by incompatible behaviour of these elements \nduring fractional crystallisation. 3) Variation in some trace element ratios (K\/Rb and Ba\/Th) \nof the CVG suggest assimilation of crust also occurs during fractional crystallisation of the \nmagma. AFC modelling and \u03b418O data suggest that typical continental-type upper-crustal \ncontaminants are not likely to be involved in AFC processes at Salak (cf. the Andes and \nLesser Antilles, Davidson et al., 2005 and references therein). Geochemical constraints \nsuggest that the contaminant is largely similar in geochemical and isotopic composition to the \nlavas themselves (e.g. volcanic and\/or plutonic arc-related or ophiolitic rocks) and \n 23\ncharacterised by 87Sr\/86Sr ~ 0.7048, extremely high Sr concentration and relatively low K\/Rb \nand Ba\/Th ratios. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nEvolution to high HFSE and HREE concentrations in the CVG lavas suggests that magma \nbeneath the central part of the volcano has bypassed deep-level storage in the lower crust, \nwhich is envisaged beneath the eastern flank vent. Volcanic rocks of the western flank SVG \ndisplay lower HFSE and HREE contents compared to the CVG, which may be explained by \nrelatively shallow, late-stage hornblende (\u00b1 accessory phase) fractionation from a CVG-type \nparent. \nHFSE and HREE variations in Salak lavas have drawn attention to the fact that Javan lavas \ndo not show highly incompatible behaviour of these elements during differentiation. Y and \nYb concentrations in eruptives from the volcanic front on Java display near-horizontal trends \nwhen plotted against silica. With little direct evidence of amphibole fractionation in these \nlavas, it is speculated that fractionation of a HFSE-HREE-compatible phase may occur at \ndepth beneath the majority of volcanoes on Java. Tengger Caldera, in East Java also displays \nabnormally steep, Y, P2O5 and TiO2 differentiation trends (similar to the CVG at Salak), \nsuggesting deep-fractionation of a HFSE-HREE-compatible phase does not take place at this \nvolcano and further corroborates the idea that the cause is related to crustal-level processes, \nrather than isolated source contributions at single volcanic centres in both East and West Java. \nThis interpretation would benefit greatly from further sampling and geochemical analysis of \nSalak SVG deposits, to better constrain differentiation trends within this group and refine the \ngeochemical models. \nFinally, the presence of a wide HFSE and HREE variation within a single volcanic centre, \nsuch as that at Salak, emphasises the importance of detailed geochemical study of individual \nvolcanoes. Arc lavas are generally characterised by high LREE\/HFSE ratios, attributed to \ninvolvement of a subducted component. However, LREE\/HFSE ratios in Salak lavas are \n 24\nrelatively low in the CVG, even though LREE concentrations are relatively high, due to high \nHSFE concentrations and positive correlations of both LREE and HFSE with SiO\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n2 in the \nCVG rocks. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Akhmad Zaennudin and collegues at the Volcanic Survey of \nIndonesia in Bandung for invaluable logistical help and guidance in the field.
