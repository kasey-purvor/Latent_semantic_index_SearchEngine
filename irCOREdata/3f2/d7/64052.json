Essentially it is an annular \nstructure with synchronous pressure anomalies of opposite sign in mid- and high-\nlatitudes: when pressures are below (above) average over Antarctica the SAM is said to \nbe in its high (low) index or positive (negative) phase. Fyfe and Lorenz (2005) proposed \nthat annular modes are more accurately characterised as a north-south shift in the \nmidlatitude jet, the result of both latitudinal shifts in the jet and independent fluctuations \nin jet strength.  \nThe SAM has shown significant positive trends during autumn and summer over \nthe past few decades (e.g. Thompson et al., 2000; Marshall, 2003), resulting in a \nstrengthening of the circumpolar westerlies. These trends have contributed to the spatial \nvariability in Antarctic temperature change (e.g. Thompson and Solomon, 2002; Kwok \nand Comiso, 2002; Schneider et al., 2004), specifically a warming in the northern \nPeninsula region and a cooling over much of the rest of the continent.  \nThe studies of Kwok and Comiso (2002) and Schneider et al. (2004) employed \nsatellite-derived temperature data to examine the relationships between the SAM and \nAntarctic temperatures. While satellite data allow an accurate mapping of these \nrelationships across the entire Antarctic continent, they are limited temporally to the \nperiod from 1982 onwards. Moreover, gridded datasets from reanalyses are generally \npoor across high southern latitudes before the mid-1970s \u2014 when the assimilation of \nsatellite data over the Southern Ocean began \u2014 including the accuracy of near-surface \nAntarctic temperatures (Bromwich and Fogt, 2004). An alternative is to use the \n 5 \nrelatively sparse ground-based network of Antarctic stations (e.g. Turner et al., 2004) to \nexamine SAM-temperature relationships. Thompson and Solomon (2002) showed that \nAntarctic temperature change congruent with the SAM for the December-May period \nfrom 1969-2000 varied from an average of \u20131.0\u00b0C in East Antarctica to +0.7\u00b0C in the \nAntarctic Peninsula. \nIn this paper we extend previous work examining SAM-Antarctic temperature \nrelationships in several ways: (i) the 48-year time period utilised, 1957-2004, is much \nlonger than those examined in earlier studies ; (ii) the four austral seasons are \nconsidered separately because significant differences exist in the magnitude of seasonal \ntrends in the SAM (cf. Table 1); and (iii) the longer period examined allows us to \nascertain whether SAM-temperature relationships have changed over time: this is \nachieved by studying running 20-year periods. \n \nData \nMonthly Antarctic near-surface temperatures from 14 stations with long records \n(see Figure 1) were obtained from the Antarctic READER (Reference Antarctic Data \nfor Environmental Research) project (Turner et al., 2004) with updates from \nhttp:\/\/www.nerc-bas.ac.uk\/icd\/gjma\/temps.html. These stations were chosen because \nthey had seasonal data from at least 85% of the 48-year period examined.  \nThe SAM index used in this study was developed by Marshall (2003) based on \nthe definition of Gong and Wang (1999), which is simply the difference in normalised \nmean zonal pressure at 40\u00b0S and 65\u00b0S. To overcome the problems of early gridded \ndatasets, as described previously, the author used monthly mean sea level pressure \n(MSLP) data at 12 stations in the SH extra-tropics to derive zonal mean pressures. This \n 6 \nSAM index is currently available for the period from 1957 onwards at http:\/\/www.nerc-\nbas.ac.uk\/icd\/gjma\/sam.html. The principal advantages of the Marshall (2003) index are \nits simplicity and temporal consistency across its entire time-span and between different \nseasons. Conversely, the main disadvantage compared to empirical orthogonal function \n(EOF) based SAM indices is that because it does not account for the changing non-\nzonal spatial SAM variability across the different seasons, which may be significant (e.g. \nFogt and Marshall, submitted), it does not describe the complete variability of the SAM. \nAll seasons refer to the Southern Hemisphere annual cycle: autumn is March-April-\nMay; winter is June-July-August; spring is September-October-November; and summer \nis December-January-February.  \n \nMethodology \nCorrelation and linear regression coefficients between the SAM and Antarctic \ntemperatures were derived using detrended data. This methodology assumes that no link \nexists between linear trends in the predictor (SAM) and predictand (temperature). Using \nthe original, undetrended data assumes that the entire trend in the predictand that \ncovaries with the predictor is due to the latter. The reality, of course, is likely to lie \nsomewhere between the two methodologies, although in this study statistics obtained \nusing the two methodologies differ only slightly. In general, the detrended data \nproduced larger (smaller) coefficients than the original data across East Antarctica \n(Antarctic Peninsula) because trends in the SAM and near-surface temperatures tend to \nbe of the opposite (same) sign, especially in autumn and summer when the SAM trends \nare greatest (cf. Table 1). Autocorrelation at lag \u20131 was accounted for when considering \nthe significance of the correlations. \n 7 \nRegression coefficients were calculated for a positive unit change in the SAM \nindex; i.e. a regression coefficient of 0.5 (\u22120.5) means that if the SAM index increases \nby one then the temperature warms (cools) by 0.5\u00b0C. When the statistical coefficients \nover running 20-year periods were calculated the SAM was recomputed for each period, \notherwise the relationship would be partially dependent on data outside the particular \n20-year period of interest. \n \nResults \nCorrelations \n Maps showing the magnitude and significance of the correlation between the \nSAM and Antarctic near-surface temperatures for 1957-2004 in autumn, winter, spring \nand summer are shown in Figs 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d, respectively. In general, in each \nseason there are positive correlations in the Antarctic Peninsula region and negative \ncorrelations across East Antarctica, as determined by previous studies. Note that there \nare no stations with long-term records in West Antarctica but satellite data indicate \nnegative correlations, similar to East Antarctica but of smaller magnitude (Kwok and \nComiso, 2002; Schneider et al., 2004). There are, however, seasonal differences in the \nsize, significance and, at some locations, the sign of the relationship between the SAM \nand temperature. \n In autumn (Fig. 2a) there are significant positive correlations between the SAM \nand temperature at stations in the northern Peninsula (Esperanza and Orcadas), \nparticularly at the former where the relationship is significant at <1% level. At Faraday, \nslightly further south, the correlation is positive but not statistically significant. Across \nEast Antarctica most correlations are negative and highly significant (<1%): the \n 8 \nstrongest correlation is \u20130.64 at Vostok. The single exception is Halley, where the \nrelationship is weaker and not significant. \n The broad spatial pattern of SAM-temperature correlations is similar in winter \n(Fig. 2b) to autumn and only the differences will be noted here. In general the \ncorrelations are smaller than in autumn and in some cases this means a reduction in the \nsignificance of the relationships: across East Antarctica this includes Syowa and \nDumont D\u2019Urville (<5%), Scott Base (<10%) and Casey, where the relationship is no \nlonger significant: this is the only season where the strong relationship between the \nSAM and Casey temperatures breaks down. The significance of the positive correlation \nat Esperanza also declines to <5%. However at Amundsen-Scott, Halley, \nNovolazarevskaya and Mawson the magnitude of the correlation is actually greater in \nwinter than autumn, with the maximum correlation of \u20130.61 found at Mawson. The \ncorrelation of \u22120.54 at Amundsen-Scott is the largest observed there in any season. \n In spring (Fig. 2c) the correlations between the SAM and Peninsula \ntemperatures are less positive. The correlation at Esperanza is only significant at <10%, \nthat at Orcadas is no longer significant, while at Faraday there has actually been a \nchange in sign of the relationship as compared to the previous two seasons. The \nnegative correlation of \u20130.28 is significant at <10%. Thus, in spring the boundary \nbetween those regions of Antarctica where temperatures are positively and negatively \ncorrelated with the SAM is located towards the very north of the Antarctic Peninsula, \nwhereas in autumn and winter it is positioned south of Faraday. The magnitude of \nnegative correlations at East Antarctic stations in spring lies broadly between those of \nautumn and winter. The main differences compared to other seasons are the reduction in \n 9 \nthe magnitude (and significance) of the correlation at Vostok and the zero correlation \nbetween the SAM and temperatures at Halley.  \n The correlation between the SAM and Esperanza temperatures is strongest in \nsummer (Fig. 2d) with a magnitude of 0.52 and a significance of <1%: the physical \nmechanisms for this relationship involve the advection of warm air across the northern \nPeninsula to the east coast, where Esperanza is located, and are described in detail by \nMarshall et al. (2006). Elsewhere in the Peninsula region the correlations at Orcadas \nand Faraday are similar to those observed in spring. Summer has the strongest seasonal \ncorrelations across most of coastal East Antarctica, the exception being Scott Base. Note \nthat summer is the only season when a significant relationship exists between the SAM \nand Halley temperatures. The strongest summer correlation is at Syowa: the value of \u2013\n0.74 there is much larger than in other seasons. \n \nRegression and temperature change \nBased on the observed trends in the SAM (Table 1) and the computed regression \ncoefficients between the SAM and temperatures derived from detrended data (not \nshown), Figure 3 displays the estimated seasonal near-surface temperature changes for \n1957-2004 that are congruent with the SAM.  \n Autumn has the largest seasonal trend in the SAM from 1957-2004 (cf. Table 1) \nand the resultant temperature changes are, at most stations, greater than in other seasons. \nAt several stations the positive trend in the SAM has resulted in contemporaneous \ntemperature changes that exceed 1\u00b0C: a warming at Esperanza and coolings at Mawson, \nDavis, Mirny, Casey, Vostok and Scott Base (Fig. 3a). The single largest SAM-related \ncooling (and regression coefficient) is at Vostok (\u20131.4\u00b0C, regression coefficient of          \n 10 \n\u20130.66\u00b0C). The proportion of total temperature change in autumn that might be attributed \nto the SAM varies significantly across Antarctica. At Amundsen-Scott the \u2018SAM-\nrelated cooling\u2019 is five times that actually observed, at Mawson it is very similar to the \ntotal cooling, a finding that is valid for other coastal East Antarctic stations, while at \nEsperanza the warming congruent with the SAM is approximately one third of that \nobserved. \n In winter the smaller trend in the SAM (about half that in autumn) means that at \nmost stations the impact of the SAM on temperatures is reduced (Fig. 3b), although \nsome stations do have their greatest regression coefficient between the SAM and \ntemperature in this season (Amundsen-Scott, Syowa, Mawson and Halley). However, at \nFaraday the SAM-related winter warming is actually larger than that in autumn, \nalthough comprising only a very small proportion (3%) of the total. This is perhaps \nsurprising given the strong relationship between sea ice west of the Peninsula and \nwinter temperatures at Faraday (e.g. King et al., 2003) and that (admittedly weaker) \nbetween the SAM and regional sea ice (Liu et al., 2004). In winter the proportion of \ntotal temperature change attributable to the SAM is generally significantly less than in \nautumn and indeed may be of opposite sign to the overall temperature trend. Thus, it is \nlikely that mechanisms other than changes in the SAM are primarily responsible for \ndriving temperature variability in this season; for example surface radiation changes on \nthe Antarctic Plateau, the influence of winter sea-ice extent in the Peninsula and \nkatabatic flow strength at some coastal stations in East Antarctica. \n There is no overall trend in the SAM for spring during 1957-2004 (cf. Table 1) \nand consequently it has had essentially no impact on contemporaneous Antarctic near-\nsurface temperature trends in this season (Fig. 3c, shown for completeness). However \n 11 \nthe SAM still plays a role in inter-annual variability as regression coefficients are often \nnot insignificant (typically 0.2-0.3): indeed at Faraday the largest seasonal regression \nbetween the SAM and temperature occurs in spring. \nIn summer the SAM has been responsible for a warming in the northern \nPeninsula and a cooling elsewhere across the continent (Fig. 3d). The temperature \nchanges are, in general, not as large as in autumn. Statistically, as the trends in the SAM \nin these two seasons are nearly identical (cf. Table 1) the greater temperature changes \ncongruent with the SAM in autumn are because of larger regression coefficients, which \nin turn result from Antarctic temperatures having a higher standard deviation in autumn \nthan in summer. At Faraday there has been a highly significant observed warming in \nsummer: Fig. 3d indicates that without the apparent negative influence of a changing \nSAM on temperatures at this location the warming would be even greater. The largest \nSAM-related cooling (\u20130.73\u00b0C) in summer is at Amundsen-Scott. Temperature trends \nacross most of Antarctica are smaller in summer than autumn. Thus, despite the greater \nSAM-related temperature change in autumn, the SAM has generally contributed a \nhigher proportion of observed temperature change in summer, often exceeding the \noverall change. For example, the cooling at Mawson associated with the SAM is \napproximately four times that observed there during 1957-2004. \n \nLong term changes in SAM-temperature relationships \n To investigate the temporal stability of the relationship between the SAM and \nAntarctic near-surface temperatures we calculate the correlation between them for \nrunning 20-year periods, from 1957-1976 to 1985-2004. Data for winter and summer \nare shown for Amundsen-Scott (Fig. 4a), Mawson (Fig. 4b) and Esperanza (Fig. 4c). \n 12 \nThese stations represent three different climatic regions: the Antarctic Plateau, coastal \nEast Antarctica and the northern Antarctic Peninsula, respectively. \n At Amundsen-Scott the winter correlation has been reasonably stable through \ntime, varying from \u20130.41 to \u20130.61 and always remaining statistically significant (Fig. \n4a). However, in summer the correlations are only of comparable magnitude to winter \nand statistically significant for 20-year periods at the beginning and end of the period \nencompassed by this study. Correlation magnitudes for periods in between are much \nsmaller, reaching as low as \u20130.03. Fig. 4a indicates that the correlations for 20-year \nperiods entirely before and entirely after 1980 have higher correlations. Analysis of the \ndata indicates that although 1980 was the second warmest summer on record at \nAmundsen-Scott, the summer SAM was positive. Hence the usual strong negative \ncorrelation between station temperatures and the SAM did not apply in the summer of \n1980 and this single highly anomalous year reduces the strength of the correlation for \nall the 20-year periods in which it occurs. \n Both the winter and summer correlation coefficients between the SAM and \ntemperatures at Mawson have remained fairly constant (Fig. 4b). However, there has \nbeen a general decrease in the winter correlation from 1962-1981 onwards\u2014the \nstrongest correlation is \u20130.80 and the weakest \u20130.51\u2014with the significance of the \nrelationship reduced to <5% level during the last four 20-year periods. In contrast, the \nrecent summer periods have shown larger correlation coefficients, with a maximum of \u2013\n0.78 in 1985-2004. All summer 20-year period correlations are significant at <1%, \nindicating that the SAM has a strong and temporally stable role in driving summer \ntemperatures in coastal East Antarctica. \n 13 \n There is a similar temporal variability in the SAM-temperature correlations at \nEsperanza in both winter and summer (Fig 4c). Although the correlation for the entire \n1957-2004 period is much greater in summer than winter at Esperanza (0.52 and 0.36, \nsignificant at <1% and <5%, respectively), Fig. 4c indicates that there are relatively few \nperiods, most noticeably the recent period from 1981-2000 onwards when the \nsignificance is at least <5%, where such a marked difference is observed in the 20-year \nperiods. This increase in the strength of the correlation appears to match the physical \nmechanism proposed by Marshall et al. (2006): the stronger summer SAM in recent \nyears means that warm westerlies pass over the Peninsula more frequently and thus \nhave had an increasingly direct influence on Esperanza temperatures.  \nHowever, for 1963-1982 and 1964-1983 the winter correlation is significant at \n<5% while that in summer is not significant at all. Moreover, there are many 20-year \nperiods when one or both the winter and summer correlations between the SAM and \nEsperanza temperatures are not statistically significant. Similar to the summer \nAmundsen-Scott data the reduced correlations can be accounted for by one or two years \nwhere there is a dramatic change (a change in sign) in the usual regional and seasonal \nrelationship between the strength and phase of the SAM and temperatures. This \nsuggests that while the SAM may play an important role in driving decadal changes in \ntemperature and consequent climate change in the north-east Peninsula, especially in \nsummer the relationship between the SAM and temperatures is less stable on an inter-\nannual basis, in contrast to that at Mawson in East Antarctica. \n \n \n \n 14 \nConclusions \nThis study has demonstrated that the general pattern of SAM-Antarctic near-\nsurface temperature relationships described in previous studies with shorter datasets\u2014\npositive in the Antarctic Peninsula and negative elsewhere on the continent\u2014is \ngenerally valid for the last half century. There are, however, some detailed differences \nbetween the seasons. Most noticeably, the sign of the relationship between the SAM and \ntemperatures at Faraday, on the western side of the Peninsula, changes from weakly \npositive in autumn and winter to significantly negative in spring and summer. Thus the \nline that separates those regions of Antarctica that are positively and negatively \ncorrelated to the SAM moves through the latitude of Faraday twice a year. Elsewhere, \nthe strength and significance of the SAM-temperature relationship may vary \nconsiderably between seasons. For example, winter is the only season when the \nnegative correlation between the SAM and temperatures at Casey is not significant\u2014in \nthe other three seasons it is significant at <1% level. Conversely, summer is the only \nseason when there is any significant relationship between the SAM and Halley \ntemperatures. Generally, SAM-temperature correlations are stronger across Antarctica \nin austral autumn and summer. \nEstimates of the contribution that trends in the SAM have made to Antarctic \nnear-surface temperature change between 1957 and 2004 exceed 1\u00b0C in autumn at \nseven of the 14 stations examined, with a maximum change of \u20131.4\u00b0C at Vostok. The \nimpact of the SAM on temperatures has been less in other seasons due to smaller \nchanges in the SAM itself, in the cases of winter and especially spring, or reduced \nvariability in the seasonal temperatures, which in turn results in smaller regression \ncoefficients with the SAM, as is the case with summer. \n 15 \nThe long-term stability of the relationship between the SAM and Antarctic \ntemperatures was examined at three stations, located on the Antarctic Plateau \n(Amundsen-Scott), coastal East Antarctica (Mawson) and northern Antarctic Peninsula \n(Esperanza). The main conclusion from this analysis, based on running 20-year periods, \nis that there has not been any significant long-term change in the strength of the \nrelationship over the near half-century examined. This finding suggests that interpreting \nappropriate chemical variability in ice cores in terms of long-term changes in the SAM \nby using transfer functions based upon recent relationships may be valid (e.g. Goodwin \net al., 2004). There are however 20-year periods when correlations between \ntemperatures and the SAM are reduced at Amundsen-Scott and Esperanza but these can \nbe traced to one or two individual years when the normal SAM-temperature relationship \nis weakened or sometimes reversed in sign. Such anomalous years do not appear to \noccur at Mawson. Thus, we may also conclude that on an inter-annual basis, the \nrelationship between the SAM and near-surface temperatures appears more stable in \ncoastal East Antarctica than elsewhere on the continent. \nThere have been a number of papers proposing physical mechanisms linking the \nchanges in the SAM to observed trends in Antarctic temperatures: Marshall et al. (2006) \nexplain the marked summer warming in the north-east Peninsula in terms of the \nincreased westerlies associated with a more positive SAM while Gillet and Thompson \n(2003) state that cooling within the region of enhanced westerlies is consistent with \nadiabatic changes in temperature driven by thermally indirect rising motion there. Gillet \nand Thompson (2003) advocated anthropogenically-induced ozone depletion above \nAntarctica in austral spring as a major driver of the changes in the SAM. As this process \ndid not become significant until ~1980, the present study suggests that it has not \n 16 \naffected significantly the relationship between the strength of the SAM and the \nmagnitude of response of Antarctic temperatures. It might prove instructive to utilise \nGeneral Circulation Models (GCMs) to examine the future stability of the relationship \nin a climate with increased greenhouse gases, which modelling studies have linked to a \nmore positive SAM (e.g. Fyfe et al., 1999; Kushner et al., 2001; Marshall et al., 2004; \nShindell and Schmidt, 2004). \n \n 17 \nReferences \nBromwich DH, Fogt RL. 2004.
