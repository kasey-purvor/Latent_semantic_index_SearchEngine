Here, we employ a commonly used rat cell line\nfor VSMCs (A7r5 cells) to investigate the effects of glucose on the expression and activity of the SPCA1 (secretory\npathway Ca2+-ATPase 1; also known as ATP2C1), which is a P-type Ca2+ pump located in the Golgi apparatus that\nplays a key role in the secretory pathway. Our results show that mRNA expression levels of SPCA1 are significantly\nincreased in A7r5 cells cultured in high glucose (25.0 mM)-supplemented medium compared with normal glucose\n(5.55 mM)-supplemented medium. SPCA1 protein expression levels and thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+-dependent\nATPase activity were also consistent with a higher than normal expression level of SPCA1 in high-glucose-cultured\nA7r5 cells. Analysis of AVP (arginine-vasopressin)-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transients in A7r5 cells (after pre-treatment\nwith thapsigargin) showed faster rise and decay phases in cells grown in high glucose medium compared with cells\ngrown in normal glucose medium, supporting the observation of increased SPCA expression\/activity. The significant\nlevels of both Ca2+-ATPase activity and AVP-induced Ca2+ transients, in the presence of thapsigargin, indicate that\nSPCA must play a significant role in Ca2+ uptake within VSMCs. We therefore propose that, if such increases in SPCA\nexpression and activity also occur in primary VSMCs, this may play a substantial role in the aetiology of diabetes\nmellitus-associated vascular disease, due to alterations in Ca2+ homoeostasis within the Golgi apparatus.\nKey words: calcium homoeostasis, diabetes, Golgi apparatus, sarcoplasmic\/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase\n(SERCA), secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SPCA1), vascular smooth muscle cell\nINTRODUCTION\nCardiovascular diseases, including those associated with diabetes\nmellitus, have long been associated with the dysregulation of\nCa2+ homoeostasis in vascular cells [1]. Comparisons between\nhealthy and diabetic subjects in the past have shown that the dis-\ntribution and use of Ca2+ ions differ between the two conditions.\nFor example, diabetes has been associated with higher than nor-\nmal basal [Ca2+]i in rat-derived cardiac myocytes [2] and VSMCs\n(vascular smooth-muscle cells) [3], as demonstrated from their\nculture in high-glucose medium.

These include Ca2+-dependent enzymes, such as in-\ncreased activity of both calpain in rat endothelial cells [5] and\nCaMKII (Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) in rat\nwhole carotid arteries [6]. In addition, it has been shown that Ca2+\ntransporters can be influenced by the diabetic state in vascular\ncells. Examples of these include the inhibition of store-operated\nCa2+ channels in rat microvascular smooth-muscle cells [7] and\nincreased activity of T-type Ca2+ channels in rat cardiomyocytes\nwww.bioscirep.org \/ Volume 29 (6) \/ Pages 397\u2013404 397\nB\nio\nsc\nie\nnc\ne \nRe\npo\nrts\n   \n  \tw\nw\nw\n.b\nio\nsc\nire\np.\nor\ng\n\u00a9 2009 The Author(s)\nThe author(s) has paid for this article to be freely available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.5\/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nP. Lai and F. Michelangeli\n[8]. The SERCA (sarcoplasmic\/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-\nATPase) has also been shown to differ between healthy and dia-\nbetic subjects, both in the form of decreased expression levels in\nheart from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [9] and increased\nactivity in rat primary VSMCs cultured in high-glucose medium\n[10].\nThe SPCA1 (secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1; also known\nas ATP2C1), a Golgi-apparatus-localized Ca2+ ion pump that is\nrelatively highly expressed in VSMCs [11], has not been invest-\nigated in relation to diabetes-related cardiovascular pathology.\nIt is unlikely, however, that the other isoform, SPCA2, plays a\nsubstantial role in cardiovascular pathology, since it is not sig-\nnificantly expressed in vascular tissue [12]. However, previous\nstudies have linked SPCA1 expression to diabetes in pancreatic\ncells [13]. Furthermore, alterations in the Golgi apparatus have\nalso been observed in VSMCs treated with kinase inhibitors to\ninhibit proliferation [14]. SPCA1 is important for establishing a\nstore of Ca2+ ions in the Golgi apparatus, which is required by\nCa2+-dependent enzymes essential for post-translational modi-\nfication of proteins in transit through the secretory pathway [15].\nIn the present study, we utilize one of the most commonly em-\nployed cell lines for VSMCs (A7r5 cells) to determine whether\nculturing them in either NG [glucose (5.55 mM) culture medium]\nor HG [high glucose (25 mM) culture medium], to mimic the\n\u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018hyperglycaemic\u2019 glucose homoeostatic states, spe-\ncifically alters the expression and activity of SPCA1.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA7r5 cell culture and treatment\nA7r5 (rat embryonic thoracic aortic smooth muscle) cells [a gift\nfrom Professor C.W. Taylor (University of Cambridge, Cam-\nbridge, U.K.)] were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s modified\nEagle\u2019s medium; Lonza), which was supplemented with 10 %\nFBS (foetal bovine serum), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 % non-essential\namino acids and 1 % 1:1 penicillin\/streptomycin (PAA Laborat-\nories). Growth was maintained under conditions of 37\u25e6C and 5 %\nCO2. Culture medium contained 25 mM D-glucose when cells\nwere maintained for growth or for obtaining cells in the \u2018hyper-\nglycaemic\u2019 HG-cultured state. Subculturing of cells was done\nevery 3\u20134 days by trypsinization using 0.05 % trypsin\/EDTA\nsolution (Invitrogen). Cells in the NG-cultured state were ini-\ntially obtained by seeding a new flask of subcultured cells from\nHG medium into NG (5.55 mM D-glucose) medium. Both NG\nand HG cells were subcultured for at least a further two passages\nin their respective medium before being used for experimenta-\ntion.\nPCR\nmRNA was extracted from cells and converted into cDNA cop-\nies via RT\u2013PCR (reverse transcription\u2013PCR), using a Super-\nscript III CellsDirectTM cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Cells\nwere harvested by trypsinization, washed with cell culture PBS\n(phosphate-buffered saline) and resuspended in 0.1 % (v\/v) DEPC\n(diethyl pyrocarbonate)-treated PBS. To prepare each cDNA\nsample, 2 \u00d7 104 cells were used.\nBIOTAQTM Taq DNA polymerase and dNTP mixture were\npurchased from Bioline. All the primers were made by Alta Bios-\ncience (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K.). Primer\nsequences and their specific PCR conditions were obtained from\nthe following associated references: SPCA1 [16], SERCA [17],\nGAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) [18], \u03b2-\nactin [17] and RPL19 (ribosomal protein L19) [19]. The SPCA1\nprimers only recognized mRNA corresponding to the SPCA1 iso-\nform (all splice variants). The SERCA primers recognized mRNA\ncorresponding to all SERCA isoforms. Each 50 \u03bcl PCR reac-\ntion mixture contained 2.5 units of BIOTAQTM, 2 mM dNTP mix\nand 1 \u03bcl of cDNA sample. SPCA1 and SERCA PCRs required\n35 cycles. GAPDH, \u03b2-actin and RPL19 required 28 cycles. All\nPCR products were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis,\nstained with SYBR\u00ae Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) and visu-\nalized using a UV transluminator. PCR product band sizes were\nchecked using a 100 bp DNA ladder (New England Biolabs).\nImages of stained gels were taken using an UVP ImageStore\n5000 system. Analysis was undertaken using ImageJ (version\n1.41e; National Institutes of Health). Mean pixel intensity values\nwere measured for the product bands, each of which was cor-\nrected for background and made relative to those for RPL19 (a\ncommonly used internal control for PCRs [19]) from the same\nsample to correct for differences in total cDNA quantity. The\nexpression of RPL19, a housekeeping protein, was unlikely to\nbe affected by different glucose culture conditions in A7r5 cells\nwhen compared with other control markers, such as GAPDH (a\nglycolytic enzyme) and \u03b2-actin (a contractility marker [20]). Val-\nues for HG samples were made relative to their counterpart NG\nsamples.\nSDS\/PAGE and Western blotting\nCell lysate samples were prepared using a proportion of the\nsame cells used for cDNA preparation. For each sample,\n(1\u20131.25) \u00d7 106 cells were incubated on ice for 2 h in lysis buf-\nfer (50 mM Tris\/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 %\nTriton X-100, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS and 1 mM\nPMSF). The cell suspension was then homogenized by passing\nit through a 21-gauge needle via a syringe; it was centrifuged at\n2400 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected.\nProteins in all cell lysate samples were separated by\nSDS\/PAGE, transferred on to nitrocellulose sheets by Western\nblotting and probed with antibodies for SPCA1, SERCA and\n\u03b1-actin. The methodology was the same as described previously\nin [11] with the following modifications: 20 \u03bcg of protein was\nloaded for each sample for SDS\/PAGE; anti-SPCA1 (custom an-\ntibody from BioCarta; [11]), anti-SERCA (YIF4) (a gift from\nDr J.M. East, Southampton University, Southampton, U.K.) and\nanti-\u03b1-actin (clone 1A4; Sigma) antibodies were diluted in TTBS\n(Tween\/Tris-buffered saline) at ratios of 1:75, 1:800 and 1:800\nrespectively and incubated with the blots for 90 min; after incub-\nation with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n398 C\u00a9The Authors Journal compilation C\u00a92009 Biochemical Society\u00a9 2009 The Author(s)\nThe author(s) has paid for this article to be freely available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.5\/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nGlucose increases expression of SPCA1 in VSMCs\nantibodies (1:3000 dilution), ImmobilonTM Western chemilumin-\nescent HRP substrate (Millipore) was used to visualize antibody-\nbound protein bands; HRP-substrate-treated blots were viewed\nand images were captured using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S Max MultiIm-\nager. Images were analysed with ImageJ software to determine\npixel intensity values for each product band. These were correc-\nted for background and values for the HG samples were made\nrelative to their counterpart NG samples.\nMicrosomal membrane preparation\nThe method used was as previously described [11] with the fol-\nlowing modifications: cells were harvested by trypsinization,\nwashed with PBS and centrifuged at 900 g for 10 min at 4\u25e6C;\nthe pellet was homogenized with both Polytron and Potter\u2013\nElvehjem-type homogenizers after resuspension in membrane\npreparation buffer; the homogenate was centrifuged at 20 000 g\nfor 15 min at 4\u25e6C, the pellet was re-homogenized and cent-\nrifuged again, and the two supernatants were combined and\ncentrifuged at 100 000 g for 50 min at 4\u25e6C. The final pellet, which\ncontained the microsomal membranes, was resuspended in fresh\nbuffer, divided into aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and\nstored at \u201380\u25e6C.\nCa2+-dependent ATPase activity\nCa2+ dependent ATPase activity was measured using the phos-\nphate liberation method, as previously described [21], with minor\nmodifications. The assay buffer included sodium azide (2 mM)\nand vanadate (2 \u03bcM) to inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and\nPMCA (plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPase) respectively. The re-\naction period was 90 min and each reaction mixture contained\n20 \u03bcg of microsomal membrane proteins. In order to distinguish\nbetween Ca2+-ATPase activity from SERCA and SPCA, experi-\nments were repeated in the presence and absence of 1 \u03bcM thap-\nsigargin (Sigma) as this would completely inhibit SERCA and\nhave minimal effects on SPCA activity [21,22].\nIntracellular Ca2+ imaging\nThe method used was the same as described previously in [23],\nbut with minor modifications. The cells were grown at a dens-\nity of 1 \u00d7 104 cells per coverslip and loaded with Fluo-3\/AM\n(acetoxymethyl ester) (Sigma) at a final concentration of 6 \u03bcM\nin HBSS (Hanks balanced salt solution). After 45 min of incuba-\ntion, the cells were incubated in HBSS containing sulfinpyrazone\n(200 \u03bcM) for 10 min. Fluo-3-loaded cells were then viewed us-\ning an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon TS-100F)\nwith filters specifically designed to monitor Fluo-3 fluorescence\nand a \u00d7 10 objective. The video images were recorded using a\nStellaCam Astrovid3 camera connected to a computer using\na Hauppage USB TV live video-capture device and soft-\nware (set at 1 frame\/s). After initiation of the recordings,\nthe cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM thapsigargin for 5 min prior\nto the addition of 10 nM AVP (arginine-vasopressin; Bachem\nBiosciences). After the latter treatment, recordings were collec-\nted for a further 5 min.\nChanges in Fluo-3 fluorescence intensity induced by AVP were\nmeasured using ImageJ software, and corrected for both back-\nground and photobleaching as previously described [23]. Values\nfor each cell were made relative to their basal fluorescence in-\ntensity value at the time point of AVP application. These relative\nvalues were used to produce Ca2+ transient plots, from which the\nkinetics of the rise and decay phases could be calculated.\nImmunohistochemistry and lectin staining\nThe method used was the same as described previously in\n[11], but with the following modifications: cells were seeded\nat a density of (3\u20134.5) \u00d7 104 cells per coverslip; prior to an-\ntibody treatment, they were fixed with 2 % (v\/v) formalde-\nhyde in PBS; anti-SPCA1 and anti-SERCA working dilutions\nwere 1:30 and 1:100 respectively; TMR (tetramethylrhodamine)-\nconjugated WGA (wheat-germ agglutinin; Invitrogen) (for Golgi\napparatus labelling) was used at 10 \u03bcg\/ml per coverslip. The la-\nbelled cells were viewed using fluorescence microscopy, with\nappropriate filters. Digital photographs of the cells were collec-\nted using the same imaging system as described above, except\nthat the images were recorded at a 640 \u00d7 480 pixel resolution.\nStatistical analysis\nS.E.M. were calculated for results from PCRs, Western blots,\nCa2+-ATPase assays and kinetic measurements from Fluo-3\nfluorescence Ca2+ imaging experiments. A two-tailed equal vari-\nance Student\u2019s t test and ANOVA (Minitab) were used to test for\nstatistical significance (P).\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 shows the PCR products, which relate to mRNA expres-\nsion levels, for SPCA1, SERCA, GAPDH and \u03b2-actin. The res-\nults were obtained from triplicate paired cultures, where the PCR\nproducts of the transcripts in HG-cultured cells were compared\nwith their corresponding paired NG-cultured cells and then ex-\npressed as a percentage. The results showed that the relative\nexpression of SPCA1 and SERCA, in HG-cultured cells com-\npared with NG-cultured cells, were found to have increased by\n60 +\u2212 13 % and 19 +\u2212 5 % respectively. Furthermore, these changes\nin expression were statistically significant between the two condi-\ntions (i.e. P< 0.01 for SPCA1 and P< 0.05 for SERCA).

Due to the inherent variabil-\nity in Ca2+-ATPase activities from different membrane prepar-\nations, experiments were done using samples of microsomal\nmembranes isolated from three replicate pairs of HG and NG\ncell cultures.

Mean activities for the three membrane prepara-\ntions were 0.75 +\u2212 0.27 nmol\/min per mg of protein for NG cells\nand 1.86 +\u2212 0.55 nmol\/min per mg of protein for HG\ncells. Statistical analysis showed that the activity differences\nbetween the two culture conditions were significant (P< 0.05).\nA comparison of total Ca2+-ATPase activity (from SERCA\nand SPCA) in the membranes, with the activity for SPCA alone,\nshowed that SPCA accounted for between 20 and 60 % of the\nCa2+-ATPase activity in A7r5 cultured cells. This is not dissimilar\nfrom our previous findings in aortic VSMC membranes, where we\nshowed that approx. 50 % of total ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake\ninto these membranes was due to SPCA [11]. Therefore these\nfindings again strongly suggest that SPCA plays a significant\nrole in Ca2+ uptake into Ca2+ stores within VSMCs.\nTo assess whether increased expression of SPCA1 can alter the\nprofile of agonist-induced cytosolic [Ca2+] transients, NG- and\nHG-cultured cells, loaded with Fluo-3, were treated with 10 nM\nAVP. These cells were first pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM thapsigargin\nin order to minimize the effects of SERCA on their response to\nAVP. Figure 3 shows the averaged traces (with each trace com-\nprising results from ten individual cells) of Fluo-3 fluorescence\nchange in both NG (Figure 3A) and HG (Figure 3B) cells. Al-\nthough the peak values in AVP-induced Ca2+ transients were\nsimilar in cells from the two glucose culture conditions, their\nkinetic profiles were notably different. The Ca2+ transients ob-\nserved for NG-cultured cells were much longer than those for\nHG-cultured cells, for both the rise and the decay phases of the\ntransients. However, if the cells were not initially pre-treated\nwith thapsigargin, the kinetics of the Ca2+ transients for both\nNG- and HG-cultured cells were very similar to each other and\nshorter (insets), consistent with observations from previous stud-\nies [24]. The mean peak heights between cells not treated and\nthose pre-treated with thapsigargin, for both NG and HG culture\nconditions, were each reduced by approx. 60 %. This shows that\nthe contribution made by SERCA-containing Ca2+ stores to the\nAVP-mediated Ca2+ responses in these cells is not overwhelm-\ningly dominant and SPCA-containing Ca2+ stores are also likely\nto contribute significantly.\nFigure 3 Ca2+ transients induced by AVP after pre-treatment\nwith thapsigargin in hyperglycaemic and normal glucose-cultured\nA7r5 cells\nFor both (A) NG and (B) HG culture conditions, the main Figures show\nresults from four coverslips, whereby each trace represents averaged\nfluorescence values from ten cells, analysed for Fluo-3 fluorescence\nchanges (F\/F0) in response to 10 nM AVP, after pre-treatment of cells\nwith thapsigargin. The insets show the typical response profile (aver-\naged from ten cells) for 10 nM AVP after pre-treatment with DMSO\n(vehicle control for thapsigargin) in cells from the same glucose culture\nconditions.

Statistical analysis of\nthese kinetic measurements for both HG- and NG-cultured cells\nshowed that these differences were significant (i.e. P< 0.05, for\nboth the rise and decay phases comparing NG- and HG-cultured\ncells).\nImmunolocalization of SPCA1, together with WGA-based\nlectin affinity staining, in NG- and HG-cultured cells showed that\nSPCA1 and the Golgi apparatus share a very similar distribution\npattern, based on its characteristic perinuclear staining (Figure 4).\nWGA binding is commonly used as a marker for the Golgi ap-\nparatu because it binds to glycoproteins highly abundant in this\norganelle [25]. Comparison of the staining patterns for SPCA1\nshowed no notable differences between NG- and HG-cultured\ncells. Thus localization of SPCA1 in A7r5 cells was largely un-\naffected by the glucose culturing conditions. Immunostaining for\nSERCA showed a more uniform distribution throughout the cell\nthat was distinct from those observed for both SPCA1 and WGA\nand which we have previously reported elsewhere for primary\nVSMCs [11].\nDISCUSSION\nResults obtained by Wootton et al. [11] showed rat aortic tissue\nand primary human aortic VSMCs express relatively high levels\nof SPCA1 protein compared with many other tissues and cell\ntypes. From Ca2+-dependent ATPase measurements we show\nthat between 20 and 60 % of the Ca2+-ATPase activity associated\nwith intracellular membranes of A7r5 cells is derived from SPCA.\nAgain this is similar to our previous findings, which showed that\nin aortic VSMC membranes approx. 50 % of the ATP-dependent\nCa2+ uptake is via SPCA [11]. This is also corroborated by the\nfact that substantial increases in AVP-induced intracellular [Ca2+]\nwere observed in thapsigargin-pre-treated cells, which suggests\nthat these VSMCs must contain a sizeable SERCA-independent\nmobilizable Ca2+ store. Therefore, taken together, these findings\nhighlight the substantial role SPCA plays in Ca2+ store refilling\nwithin VSMCs.\nIt has also been well established that vascular tissues prone\nto developing atherosclerotic plaques (as observed in diabetes\nmellitus [26]) have a tendency to change their VSMCs from a\ncontractile to a secretory phenotype [27]. This is characterized by\ntheir increased ability to produce secreted proteins, such as col-\nlagen and proteoglycans found in the extracellular matrix [28].\nSince SPCA1 plays an important role in both post-translational\nmodification of proteins in the Golgi apparatus and transit of pro-\nteins through the secretory pathway, the aim of the present study\nwas to investigate whether SPCA1 expression and\/or activity is\ndifferent between NG and HG-cultured A7r5 cells, a commonly\nused cell line for VSMCs.\nMeasurements of mRNA and protein levels in this study\nshowed A7r5 cells grown in HG culture medium expressed meas-\nurably more SPCA1 than cells grown in NG culture medium,\nwhich suggests that glucose availability can influence the expres-\nsion of this protein. There was a notable difference, however,\nin the extent of change between SPCA1 mRNA and protein ex-\npression levels, whereby a 60 % increase in mRNA resulted in\nonly approx. 15 % increase in protein. A similar discrepancy was\nobserved by Reinhardt et al. [29] when they compared SPCA\nexpression levels between rat mammary and brain tissue, and\nattributed their finding to a difference in protein turnover. A sim-\nilar explanation may, at least in part, explain our observation\nin A7r5 cells. Transcriptional control of SPCA1 may also play\na role, since Sp1 and YY1, which are the transcription factors\nof the SPCA1 gene [30], possess increased activity in cells\ngrown in high, compared with normal, glucose media [31,32].\nOne possibility could be that a combination of enhanced tran-\nscription and near-maximal translation of the SPCA1 gene in\nhyperglycaemic A7r5 cells may result in an increase in its mRNA,\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n402 C\u00a9The Authors Journal compilation C\u00a92009 Biochemical Society\u00a9 2009 The Author(s)\nThe author(s) has paid for this article to be freely available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.5\/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nGlucose increases expression of SPCA1 in VSMCs\nbut not necessarily increase in its protein levels to the same\nextent.\nConsistent with results from PCR-based mRNA measurement\nand immunochemical detection of SPCA1 protein, thapsigargin-\ninsensitive Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in microsomal mem-\nbranes (representative of SPCA activity) was also found to be\nhigher from HG, compared with NG, cultured cells. However,\nthe mean activity for the HG-cultured cells was approx. 2-fold\nhigher than that for the NG-cultured cells, which would\nalso appear to be disproportionate to the increase in SPCA1\nprotein levels observed. Such differences may be explained by\nthe differences in Ca2+ transport activities between different\nSPCA1 splice variants [33]. In our present study, we measured\nall SPCA activity and the expression of all SPCA1 slice vari-\nants. However, one could envisage that an increased expression\nof SPCA1 splice variants that have higher levels of activity could\ncontribute to the higher than normal SPCA activity observed in\nHG-cultured cells. However, this possibility needs to be further\nexplored.\nIn order to assess whether higher than normal expression of\nSPCA1 within HG-cultured A7r5 cells can alter agonist-induced\ncytosolic [Ca2+] transients, the effects of AVP on cytosolic [Ca2+]\nprofiles were investigated. AVP (working through the phospho-\ninositide pathway) initiates Ca2+ mobilization from internal Ca2+\nstores and stimulates Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium.\nCytosolic Ca2+ removal (by uptake into intracellular stores and\nextrusion out of the cell) then follows, resulting in a typical Ca2+\ntransient profile [24]. In our present study, using thapsigargin-\npre-treated A7r5 cells, we showed that, although the peak heights\nof SERCA-independent AVP-induced Ca2+ transients were not\nsignificantly different between NG- and HG-cultured cells, these\ntransients were different with regard to both their rise and de-\ncay phase kinetics. The differences in the rise and decay phase\nkinetics could be attributed to differences in the abundance of\nthapsigargin-insensitive IP3-releasable Ca2+ stores (i.e. Golgi\nCa2+ stores). Thus, if HG-cultured cells had more of these Ca2+\nstores than NG-cultured cells, this could result in higher rates\nof Ca2+ release, as well as higher rates of Ca2+ re-uptake (due\nto their higher levels of SPCA). This becomes even more appar-\nent once SERCA-containing Ca2+ stores have been emptied by\nthapsigargin treatment.\nOur immunostaining studies confirm that SPCA1 remains loc-\nated at the distinct regions within the cell consistent with being the\nGolgi apparatus, rather than more widely distributed throughout\nthe endoplasmic reticulum like SERCA. Furthermore, increased\nSPCA expression, as observed in HG-cultured cells, does not\nappear to affect its subcellular location (Figure 4).\nIn summary, the present study has shown that culturing A7r5\ncells (a commonly used VSMC model) in HG medium (which\nmimics the hyperglycaemic state associated with severe diabetes\nmellitus) can lead to: (i) higher SPCA1 expression levels (both\nat the mRNA and protein levels); (ii) increased thapsigargin-\ninsensitive Ca2+-ATPase activity, which is comparable with the\nactivity observed for SERCA; and (iii) higher rates of both\nthe rise and decay phases of AVP-induced Ca2+ transients in\nthapsigargin-pre-treated cells. These findings suggest that gluc-\nose availability can substantially affect the Ca2+-handling proper-\nties within the Golgi apparatus and therefore affect the secretory\npathway and post-translational protein modification processes,\nas well as Ca2+-mediated hormonal responses, in A7r5 VSMCs.\nIf these changes in SPCA1 expression and activity also occur in\nprimary VSMCs, this might potentially contribute towards car-\ndiovascular diseases often associated with diabetes. Therefore\nfurther studies are required, using primary VSMCs cultured in\ndifferent glucose media, as well as studying cells isolated from\nnormal and severely diabetic animals, in order to corroborate this\nhypothesis.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Professor Colin Taylor (Department of Pharmacology, Uni-\nversity of Cambridge) for supplying A7r5 cells, Dr J.
