INTRODUCTION\nOver the last five years, it has become possible to control\nthe behavior of ultracold atomic gases by tuning the interac-\ntions between atoms using applied magnetic fields \u00031,2\u0004. No-\ntable successes have included the controlled implosion of\nBose-Einstein condensates \u00033\u0004 and the production of mol-\necules in both bosonic \u00034\u20137\u0004 and fermionic \u00038\u201311\u0004 quantum\ngases. Long-lived molecular Bose-Einstein condensates of\nfermion dimers have been produced \u000312\u201314\u0004, and the first\nsignatures of ultracold triatomic \u000315\u0004 and tetra-atomic \u000316\u0004\nmolecules have been observed. The new capabilities in\natomic physics have had important applications in other ar-\neas: for example, the tunability of atomic interactions has\nallowed exploration of the crossover between Bose-Einstein\ncondensation and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer behavior in di-\nlute gases \u000317\u201319\u0004.\nIn parallel with the work on atomic gases, there have been\nintense efforts to cool molecules directly from high tempera-\nture to the ultracold regime. Molecules such as NH3, OH,\nand NH have been cooled from room temperature to the\nmillikelvin regime by a variety of methods including buffer-\ngas cooling \u000320,21\u0004 and Stark deceleration \u000322,23\u0004. Directly\ncooled molecules have been successfully trapped at tempera-\ntures around 10 mK, and there are a variety of proposals for\nways to cool them further, including evaporative cooling,\nsympathetic cooling, and cavity-assisted cooling \u000324,25\u0004.\nThe possibility of controlling molecular interactions in\nthe same way as atomic interactions is of great interest. Sev-\neral groups have begun to explore the effects of external\nfields on ultracold molecular collisions \u000326\u0004. Volpi and Bohn\n\u000327\u0004 investigated collisions of 17O2 with He and found a very\nstrong enhancement of spin-flipping cross sections even for\nweak magnetic fields. Krems et al. \u000328\u0004 and Cybulski et al.\n\u000329\u0004 investigated spin-flipping collisions of NH with He and\nfound a similar dependence on magnetic field. Krems and\nDalgarno \u000330,31\u0004 elaborated the formal theory of scattering\nin a magnetic field for a variety of atom-molecule and\nmolecule-molecule cases involving molecules in 2\u0003 and 3\u0003\nstates. Ticknor and Bohn \u000332\u0004 investigated OH+OH colli-\nsions and found that in this case magnetic fields could sup-\npress inelastic collisions. Lara et al. \u000333,34\u0004 investigated the\nvery complicated case of OH+Rb collisions, using basis sets\ndesigned to allow a magnetic field to be applied, though their\ninitial calculations were for zero field.\nThe effects of electric fields have also been investigated.\nAvdeenkov and Bohn \u000335,36\u0004 investigated OH-OH collisions\nin the presence of electric fields that caused alignment of the\nmolecules. They identified novel field-linked states arising\nfrom long-range avoided crossings between effective poten-\ntial curves in the presence of a field \u000336\u201339\u0004. Avdeenkov et\nal. \u000340\u0004 have also investigated the effects of very high elec-\ntric fields on collisions of closed-shell molecules. Very re-\ncently, Tscherbul and Krems \u000341\u0004 have explored the effect of\ncombined electric and magnetic fields on He-CaH collisions\nand observed significant suppression of spin-flipping transi-\ntions at high electric fields in the cold regime \u0001\u00050.5 K\u0002.\nAn important technique used to produce dimers in ultra-\ncold atomic gases is magnetic tuning across Feshbach reso-\nnances \u00031,2\u0004. A Feshbach resonance \u000342,43\u0004 occurs whenever\na bound state associated with one potential curve lies above\nthe threshold for another curve. The resonance thus corre-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW A 75, 022702 \u00012007\u0002\n1050-2947\/2007\/75\u00012\u0002\/022702\u000114\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society022702-1\nsponds to a level embedded in a continuum, which is a qua-\nsibound state. In the atomic case, the thresholds that produce\nlow-energy Feshbach resonances are associated with differ-\nent hyperfine states of the interacting atoms. It is often pos-\nsible to tune a resonance across threshold \u0001from above or\nbelow\u0002 by applying a magnetic field. This produces an\navoided crossing between atomic and molecular states. If the\nmagnetic field is tuned across the resonance slowly enough\nto follow the avoided crossing adiabatically, pairs of atoms\ncan be converted into molecules or vice versa.\nMolecules have a much richer energy level structure than\natoms, and there are many additional types of Feshbach reso-\nnance. In particular, rotational Feshbach resonances can oc-\ncur \u000344,45\u0004 and have significant influences on ultracold mo-\nlecular collisions \u000346\u0004. Other small energy level splittings,\nsuch as spin rotation and \u0004 doubling, can also cause reso-\nnances in molecular scattering. It is of great interest to char-\nacterize such resonances and their field dependence, both to\nunderstand their influence on collision cross sections and to\nprepare the ground for experiments that associate molecules\nby Feshbach resonance tuning.\nThe NH molecule is particularly topical in cold and ultra-\ncold molecule studies. It is a dipolar molecule with a 3\u0003\u2212\nground state, so it is both electrostatically and magnetically\ntrappable. It has been cooled by beam-loaded buffer-gas\ncooling \u000321\u0004 and is a promising candidate for molecular\nbeam deceleration and trapping \u000347\u0004. Krems et al. \u000328\u0004 and\nCybulski et al. \u000329\u0004 have calculated potential energy surfaces\nfor He-NH and used them in scattering calculations. Cybul-\nski et al. also calculated zero-field bound states of the\nHe-NH van der Waals complex. An electronic excitation\nspectrum of the van der Waals complex has been observed\nby Kerenskaya et al. \u000348\u0004. Sold\u00e1n and Hutson \u000349\u0004 have in-\nvestigated the interaction potentials for NH with Rb, and\nDhont et al. \u000350\u0004 have developed interaction potential energy\nsurfaces for NH-NH in the singlet, triplet, and quintet states.\nIn the present paper we describe calculations of the bound\nstates of a van der Waals complex in a magnetic field. We\nshow how such calculations can be used to locate zero-\nenergy Feshbach resonances as a function of applied field.\nElastic and inelastic cross sections can then be tuned by\nsweeping the field across the Feshbach resonance. Such field\nsweeps could also be used to transfer unbound atom-\nmolecule or molecule-molecule pairs into bound states of the\ncorresponding complex.\nA remarkable conclusion of the present paper is that, in\nthe presence of inelastic scattering, the poles in scattering\nlengths that characterize low-energy Feshbach resonances in\natomic systems \u00032\u0004 can be dramatically suppressed and elas-\ntic and inelastic cross sections show relatively small peaks as\nresonances cross thresholds. The numerical results obtained\nhere allow us to test analytical formulas for this effect re-\ncently given by Hutson \u000351\u0004.\nII. METHODS FOR BOUND-STATE CALCULATIONS\nWe consider the case of an NH molecule interacting with\na He atom in the presence of a magnetic field. The Hamil-\ntonian for this in Jacobi coordinates \u0001R ,\u0005\u0002 is\nH\u02c6 = \u2212\n\u00062\n2\u0007\nR\u22121\nd2\ndR2\nR +\nL\u02c6 2\n2\u0007R2\n+ H\u02c6 mon + H\u02c6 Z + V\u0001R,\u0005\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere L\u02c6 2 is the space-fixed operator for end-over-end rota-\ntion, H\u02c6 mon is the Hamiltonian for the NH monomer, H\u02c6 Z is the\nZeeman interaction, and V\u0001R ,\u0005\u0002 is the intermolecular poten-\ntial. For simplicity we consider the NH molecule to be a\nrigid rotor, but the generalization to include NH vibrations is\nstraightforward. The NH monomer Hamiltonian is therefore\nH\u02c6 mon = \u0006\u22122bNHN\u02c6 2 + H\u02c6 SN + H\u02c6 SS, \u00012\u0002\nwhere bNH=16.343 cm\u22121 is the rotational constant of NH in\nits ground vibrational level \u000352\u0004,\nH\u02c6 SN = \u0006\u22122\bN\u02c6 \u00b7 S\u02c6 \u00013\u0002\nis the spin-rotation operator, and\nH\u02c6 SS =\n2\n3\n\tSS\u00064\n5 \u00071\/2\b6\tq \u0001\u2212 1\u0002qY2\u2212q\u0001r\u02c6\u0002\u0003S \u0001 S\u0004q\u00012\u0002 \u00014\u0002\nis the spin-spin operator written in space-fixed coordinates\n\u000353\u0004. N\u02c6 and S\u02c6 are the operators for the rotational and spin\nangular momenta. The numerical values for the spin-rotation\nand spin-spin constants are \b=\u22120.0055 cm\u22121 and \tSS\n=0.920 cm\u22121 \u000353\u0004.\nThere are several basis sets that could be used to expand\nthe eigenfunctions of Eq. \u00011\u0002. We consider two of them in the\npresent work, which we refer to as the coupled and un-\ncoupled basis sets. Both basis sets represent the end-over-end\nrotation with quantum numbers \nLML\u000b, where L is a rota-\ntional quantum number and ML is its projection onto the\nspace-fixed Z axis.\nWe use the convention that quantum numbers that de-\nscribe a monomer are represented with lower-case letters,\nand reserve capital letters to describe states of the complex as\na whole. In the absence of a magnetic field \u0001or a perturbing\natom\u0002, the rotational states of NH are approximately de-\nscribed by quantum numbers n, s, and j, where n represents\nthe mechanical rotational of NH, s is the electron spin, and j\nis the vector sum of n and s. In the coupled representation for\nthe He-NH problem, we use basis functions \nnsjmj\u000b \nLML\u000b\nthat retain these monomer quantum numbers, with mj\nthe projection of j onto the space-fixed Z axis. In the un-\ncoupled representation, we use instead basis functions\n\nnmn\u000b \nsms\u000b \nLML\u000b, where mn and ms are the projections of n\nand s individually.\nIn both basis sets we use, the matrix elements of L\u02c6 2 are\ndiagonal in all quantum numbers and are simply \u00062L\u0001L+1\u0002.\nThe rotational part of the monomer Hamiltonian is also di-\nagonal, with matrix elements bNHn\u0001n+1\u0002. The remaining ma-\ntrix elements of the NH monomer Hamiltonian in the two\nbasis sets are\nMAYKEL LEONARDO GONZ\u00c1LEZ-MART\u00cdNEZ AND JEREMY M.

For N channels there are N\ncoupled equations. However, it is actually necessary to\npropagate a set of N linearly independent solutions, so \u0011\u0001R\u0002\nis an N\rN matrix. The log-derivative matrix Y\n= \u0001d\u0011 \/dR\u0002\u0011\u22121 is propagated outward from Rmin and inward\nfrom Rmax to a common matching point Rmid in the classi-\ncally allowed region of the potential using Johnson\u2019s algo-\nrithm \u000357\u0004. This is done for a series of trial energies. If the\nenergy is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian, the determinant\nof the log-derivative matching matrix Ymatch=Y in\u2212Yout is\nzero. Bound states are located by searching for zeros of ei-\ngenvalues of Ymatch as a function of energy. The log-\nderivative method provides a generalized node count \u000355,58\u0004\nwhich increases by 1 at each energy eigenvalue, and this\nallows us to use bisection to identify regions of energy that\ncontain a bound state. The actual convergence on an energy\neigenvalue uses the secant method, which gives quadratic\nconvergence.\nVersion 5 of the BOUND program \u000356\u0004 contained an inter-\nface to allow new basis sets to be added, but could only\nhandle basis sets in which the monomer Hamiltonian was\ndiagonal. We have extended the program to remove this re-\nstriction and implemented the coupled and uncoupled basis\nsets described above. We have also built in new loops over\nexternal fields to simplify calculations on Stark and Zeeman\neffects.\nIII. RESULTS OF BOUND-STATE CALCULATIONS\nWe have carried out bound-state calculations on 4He-NH\nand 3He-NH using the potential energy surface of Krems et\nal. \u000328\u0004 \u0001described in more detail as potential 2 of Cybulski\net al. \u000329\u0004\u0002. The basis set included all functions with n\u00128\nand L\u00127. The coupled equations were propagated outward\nfrom 1.8 to 3.57 \u00c5 and inward from 16.0 to 3.57 \u00c5 using a\nlog-derivative sector size of 0.025 \u00c5. Wentzel-Kramers-\nBrillouin \u0001WKB\u0002 boundary conditions were applied in each\nchannel at Rmax to improve the convergence.\nIn zero field, the levels of He-NH are characterized by the\ntotal angular momentum J, which is the vector sum of j and\nL. The total parity is also conserved and is given by\n\u0001\u22121\u0002n+L+1. Since the lowest levels of NH have n=0, j=s=1\nand J=L, L\u00b11. The three different J levels corresponding to\neach value of L are very close together: the separation is only\nabout 10\u22123 cm\u22121 for L=1. The angular momentum coupling\nscheme corresponds to case \u0001B\u0002 of Dubernet, Flower, and\nHutson \u000359\u0004.\nThe field-free energies of He-NH on this potential have\nbeen calculated previously by Cybulski et al. \u000329\u0004. Our re-\nsults agree with theirs to \u00b110\u22124 cm\u22121 for the levels with L\n=0\u20132, but are approximately 0.0014 cm\u22121 lower for the L\n=3 levels of 4He-NH, which are bound by only 0.765 cm\u22121.\nWe attribute the difference to lack of convergence of the\nradial basis set used in their calculations. The results ob-\ntained from our program with the coupled and uncoupled\nbasis sets are identical to \u00b110\u22129 cm\u22121, which confirms the\ncorrectness of the code.\nIn the presence of a field, J is very quickly destroyed.\nThe only rigorously good quantum numbers in a magnetic\nfield are parity and MJ=mj +ML=mn+ms+ML. The bound-\nstate energies for levels correlating with n=0 for 3He-NH\nwith MJ=0 and \u22121 are shown in Fig. 1. Each level splits into\ncomponents that can be labeled with the approximate quan-\ntum numbers mn=0 and ms=0, \u00b11. L remains an essentially\ngood quantum number except in the vicinity of the avoided\ncrossings. The major difference between MJ values is that\nsome ms levels are missing for MJ\u00010, but there are also\nsmall shifts of all the energy levels. A similar plot for\n4He-NH with MJ=0 is shown in Fig. 2.\nAs expected, the Zeeman effect is generally quite linear\nfor He-NH in the range of fields studied. This is because for\nn=0 the only off-diagonal terms are those of V\u0001R ,\u0005\u0002 and H\u02c6 SS\nMAYKEL LEONARDO GONZ\u00c1LEZ-MART\u00cdNEZ AND JEREMY M. HUTSON PHYSICAL REVIEW A 75, 022702 \u00012007\u0002\n022702-4\nthat mix in excited n levels, and the spacing between the n\n=0 and n=1 levels for NH is around 32.6 cm\u22121. Neverthe-\nless, there are avoided crossings where levels of the same\nMJ and parity but different ms cross. Expanded views of the\nenergy level diagrams in the region of avoided crossings are\nshown for 4He in Fig. 3 and for 3He in Fig. 4. It may be seen\nthat in this system the crossings are very tightly avoided,\nwith spacings at the crossing points of \u000eE=5.2\r10\u22124 and\n2.0\r10\u22123 cm\u22121 for 4He and \u000eE=1.5\r10\u22123 cm\u22121 for 3He.\nThe reason that the crossings are so tightly avoided in this\ncase is that there are no direct off-diagonal matrix elements\nbetween n=0 basis functions with different values of ms. The\ndominant coupling is a second-order one of the form\n\f001ms\nH\u02c6 SS\n2mn1ms\u0001\u000b\f2mn1ms\u0001\nV2\n001ms\u0001\u000b\nEn=2 \u2212 En=0\n, \u000117\u0002\nwhere basis functions are represented as \nnmnsms\u000b and mn\n=ms\u2212ms\u0001. Such crossings will thus be more strongly avoided\nin systems with stronger anisotropy or smaller monomer ro-\ntational constant.\nIf matrix elements of H\u02c6 SS off diagonal in n are omitted,\nthe avoided crossings still exist but are about a factor of 5\ntighter. Under these circumstances they are caused by a third-\norder mechanism in which potential couplings mix in basis\nfunctions with n\u00130 \u0001but the same values of ms and ms\u0001\u0002 and\nthese are connected by H\u02c6 SS.\nIt should be noted that for levels with n\u00130 there are\ndirect matrix elements of H\u02c6 SS and H\u02c6 NS that connect levels\nwith different ms but the same mj. This will produce more\nstrongly avoided crossings where the separation is simply\nproportional to \tSS \u0001or \b for 2\u0003 monomers\u0002. This will be\nparticularly important for 16O2, which has an n=1 ground\nstate.\nThe boundary conditions applied by the BOUND program\nare only correct for true bound states, below the lowest dis-\nsociation threshold. Above a threshold, the boundary condi-\ntions produce artificially quantized states. These are of two\ntypes: states that are predominantly in an open channel,\nwhich have no physical significance; and states that are pre-\ndominantly in a closed channel, which correspond closely to\nquasibound states of the real system but with only an ap-\nproximate open-channel \u0001dissociative\u0002 component. The two\ntypes are very easy to tell apart: the open-channel states are\nclosely parallel to a lower threshold, and inspection of the\nwave function confirms their parentage. The open-channel\nstates have been omitted from Figs. 1 and 2. The closed-\nchannel states are shown as dashed lines above the lowest\nthreshold. They allow us to estimate very precisely where a\nbound or quasibound state crosses a threshold, and thus\nwhere a zero-energy resonance is expected in the scattering.\nThis information will be used in Sec. V below.\nIV. METHODS FOR SCATTERING CALCULATIONS\nThe coupled equations needed for scattering calculations\nare identical to those for bound states.

We have generalized\nMOLSCAT in the same way as BOUND to handle basis sets in\nwhich the monomer Hamiltonian is nondiagonal.\nA. Boundary conditions\nThe usual procedure for obtaining the scattering matrix S\nfrom the log-derivative matrix Y has been described by\nJohnson \u000357\u0004. Each channel is either open, E\u0014Ei, or closed,\nE\u0015Ei. If matching takes place at a finite distance Rmax where\nthe wave function in the closed channels \u0001E\u0015Ei\u0002 has not\ndecayed to zero, it is necessary to take account of the closed\nchannels. The asymptotic form of the wave function is\n\u0011\u0001R\u0002 = J\u0001R\u0002 + N\u0001R\u0002K , \u000118\u0002\nwhere J\u0001R\u0002 and N\u0001R\u0002 are diagonal matrices made up of\nRiccati-Bessel functions for open channels and modified\nspherical Bessel functions for closed channels. If there are N\nchannels and Nopen open channels, the N\rN log-derivative\nmatrix is converted into an N\rN real symmetric K matrix.\nThe S matrix is then obtained from the open-open submatrix,\nKoo, using the relationship\nS = \u0001I + iKoo\u0002\u22121\u0001I \u2212 iKoo\u0002 , \u000119\u0002\nwhere I is an Nopen\rNopen unit matrix. However, the bound-\nary conditions \u000118\u0002 are appropriate only in a basis set in\nwhich both L\u02c6 2 and the asymptotic Hamiltonian are diagonal.\nIn our generalized version of MOLSCAT, the log-derivative\nmatrix Y is propagated in the primitive basis set \u0001which is\nnondiagonal\u0002 and then transformed at Rmax into a basis set\nthat diagonalises H\u02c6 mon+H\u02c6 Z.\nFor the simple case of He-NH, the eigenvalues of H\u02c6 mon\n+H\u02c6 Z are nondegenerate except at zero field. The transforma-\ntion that diagonalizes H\u02c6 mon+H\u02c6 Z is thus unique. However, in\nmore complicated cases it may be necessary to transform to a\nbasis set that diagonalizes H\u02c6 mon,1+H\u02c6 Z,1 and H\u02c6 mon,2+H\u02c6 Z,2\nseparately. Additional degeneracies arise at zero field, and\nresolving them may require diagonalization of another opera-\ntor such as j\u02c6Z.\nB. Cross sections\nThe cross section for a transition i\u2192 f from initial state i\nto final state f is obtained from the square of the correspond-\ning T matrix element,\n\u0016if =\n\n\nk2\n\nTif\n2, \u000120\u0002\nwhere k is the incoming wave vector, k2=2\u0007\u0001E\u2212Ei\u0002 \/\u00062, and\nTif =\u000bif \u2212Sif. In general it is necessary to sum over all chan-\nnels corresponding to the monomer levels of interest and\nover S matrices obtained for different values of MJ and par-\nity. In the present work, however, we deal with cross sections\ninvolving nondegenerate states for which no summations are\nneeded.\n-3.5425\n-3.5420\n-3.5415\n-3.5410\n-3.5405\n-3.5400\n-3.5395\n23476 23479 23482 23485 23488 23491 23494\nEn\ner\ngy\n (c\nm-\n1 )\nMagnetic Field (G)\n\u2206E \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10 -3  cm -1\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Avoided crossing between levels with\nms=0 and ms=\u22121 for 3He-NH as a function of magnetic field B.\n-2.2866\n-2.2863\n-2.2860\n-2.2857\n-2.2854\n-2.2851\n-2.2848\n16197 16200 16203 16206 16209\nEn\ner\ngy\n (c\nm-\n1 )\nMagnetic Field (G)\n\u2206E \u2248 5.2 \u00d7 10-4\n(a)\n cm-1\n-4.4365\n(b)\n-4.4360\n-4.4355\n-4.4350\n-4.4345\n-4.4340\n-4.4335\n-4.4330\n20116 20120 20124 20128 20132 20136\nEn\ner\ngy\n (c\nm-1\n)\nMagnetic Field (G)\n\u2206E \u2248 2.0 \u00d7 10-3 cm-1\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Avoided crossing between levels with\nms= +1 and ms=\u22121 \u0001upper panel\u0002 and between levels with ms=0\nand ms=\u22121 \u0001lower panel\u0002 for 4He-NH as a function of magnetic\nfield B.\nMAYKEL LEONARDO GONZ\u00c1LEZ-MART\u00cdNEZ AND JEREMY M.

Resonant behavior\nIf there is only one open channel, then the phase shift \u000b is\nreal and its behavior is sufficient to characterize a resonance.\nIt follows a Breit-Wigner form as a function of energy,\n\u000b\u0001E\u0002 = \u000bbg + tan\u22121\u0006 \u0019E2\u0001Eres \u2212 E\u0002\u0007 , \u000128\u0002\nwhere \u000bbg is a slowly varying background term, Eres is the\nresonance position, and \u0019E is its width \u0001in energy space\u0002.\nThis corresponds to the S-matrix element describing a circle\nof radius 1 in the complex plane. In general the parameters\n\u000bbg, Eres, and \u0019E are slow functions of energy, but this is\nneglected in the present work apart from threshold behavior.\nThe resonance position Eres and the threshold energy\nEthresh are both functions of magnetic field,\ndEres\ndB\n= \u0007res and\ndEthresh\ndB\n= \u0007thresh. \u000129\u0002\nWe define Bres\u0001E\u0002 as the field at which Eres=E. For low ki-\nnetic energies, the width \u0019E also depends on the field through\nits threshold dependence \u000365\u0004,\n\u0019E\u0001Ekin\u0002 = 2k\bE, \u000130\u0002\nwith constant reduced width \bE. As a function of magnetic\nfield at constant kinetic energy, the phase shift thus follows a\nform similar to Eq. \u000128\u0002,\n\u000b\u0001B\u0002 = \u000bbg + tan\u22121\u0006 \u0019B\u0001Ekin\u00022\u0001Bres\u0001E\u0002 \u2212 B\u0002\u0007 . \u000131\u0002\nThe width \u0019B\u0001Ekin\u0002 is a signed quantity that is negative if the\nbound state tunes upward through the energy of interest and\npositive if it tunes downward,\n\u0019B\u0001Ekin\u0002 =\n\u0019E\u0001Ekin\u0002\n\u0007thresh \u2212 \u0007res\n. \u000132\u0002\nThe background phase shift \u000bbg goes to zero as k\u21920 accord-\ning to Eq. \u000122\u0002 \u0001with the background scattering length abg\nfinite and independent of k\u0002, but the resonant term still exists.\nThe scattering length passes through a pole when \u000b= \u0001n\n+ 12 \u0002\n. The scattering length follows the formula commonly\nused in atomic scattering \u000366\u0004,\na\u0001B\u0002 = abg\u00061 \u2212 \u000eBB \u2212 Bres\u0001E\u0002\u0007 , \u000133\u0002\nwhere \u000eB=\u2212\u0019B \/2kabg=\u2212\bB \/abg and is independent of k near\nthreshold.\nWhen there are several open channels, \u000b is in general\ncomplex. The quantity that then follows the Breit-Wigner\nform \u000128\u0002 and \u000131\u0002 is the S-matrix eigenphase sum \u000344,67\u0004,\nwhich is the sum of phases of the eigenvalues of the S ma-\ntrix. The eigenphase sum is real, because the S matrix is\nunitary, so that all its eigenvalues have modulus 1. In prac-\ntice the eigenphase sum is most conveniently calculated by\ndiagonalizing the real symmetric matrix Koo and summing\nthe inverse tangents of its eigenvalues.\nIf there is more than one open channel, the individual\nS-matrix elements still describe circles in the complex plane,\nSii\u0001 = Sbg,ii\u0001 \u2212\nigEigEi\u0001\nE \u2212 Eres + i\u0019E\/2\n, \u000134\u0002\nwhere gEi is complex.

In\nthe low-energy threshold regime, \u0019B0 is proportional to k and\nwe may define an energy-independent reduced width \bB0,\n\u0019B0 = 2\bB0k . \u000136\u0002\nHowever, \u0019B has inelastic contributions \u0019B\ninel that are essen-\ntially energy independent. Hutson \u000351\u0004 has defined a reso-\nnant scattering length\nares =\n2\bB0\n\u0019B\ninel \u000137\u0002\nthat characterizes the strength of the resonant contribution to\nthe scattering at low energy. If kares\u00021, S00 describes a\ncircle of radius 2kares in the complex plane as a resonance is\ntuned through threshold and the real part of the scattering\nlength oscillates by \u00b1ares \/2.\nAs will be seen below, for He+NH the inelastic scattering\nstrongly suppresses the pole in the scattering length and the\nresonant oscillation in the scattering length is of quite small\namplitude. The corresponding oscillations in the elastic and\ninelastic cross sections are also relatively weak.\nV. RESULTS OF SCATTERING CALCULATIONS\nWe have carried out scattering calculations on 4He-NH\nand 3He-NH using the potential energy surface of Krems et\nal. \u000328\u0004. These calculations used a reduced basis set of func-\ntions with n\u00124 and L\u00125 to allow comparison with previous\nstudies. The coupled equations were propagated outward\nfrom 1.7 to 120.0 \u00c5 using Johnson\u2019s log-derivative algo-\nrithm \u000357\u0004 with a sector size of 0.025 \u00c5.\nWe have verified that the present code gives identical\nscattering results for He-NH with the coupled and uncoupled\nbasis sets. This confirms the correctness of the coding for the\nbasis sets and the extraction of S matrices. Our program also\ngives identical results to Refs. \u000328,29\u0004 for scattering in a\nmagnetic field.\nIt is of great interest to investigate the effect of zero-\nenergy Feshbach resonances on low-energy molecular scat-\ntering as a function of magnetic field. However, a major\nproblem is that the resonances can be very narrow, and lo-\ncating the fields at which they occur is difficult and time\nconsuming. For example, in the He-NH problem we expect\nthe coupling between bound and continuum states with dif-\nferent mj to be comparable to or smaller than that between\nbound states of different mj. To a first approximation, the\nlatter is the energy separation of the bound-state avoided\ncrossings, which is around 10\u22123 cm\u22121. Since the energy of a\nstate with ms= \u00b11 tunes by about 10\u22124 cm\u22121\/G, we expect\nthe Feshbach resonances to be less \u0001perhaps much less\u0002 than\n10 G wide.\nFortunately, the bound-state capability described above\nprovides a solution to this problem: we can extrapolate the\nbound-state energies to calculate the field at which they cross\na threshold and then scan across a small range of fields in the\nvicinity. As an example, we searched for Feshbach reso-\nnances in 3He-NH. It may be seen in Fig. 1 that there is a\n3He-NH bound state with ms= +1 that crosses the ms=\u22121\nthreshold at about 7200 G and the ms=0 threshold at about\n14 300 G. Careful extrapolation of the bound-state energies\nwith the basis set used for the scattering calculations gives\nmore precise field estimates of 7168.750 G \u0001for MJ=\u22121\u0002 and\n14340.36 G \u0001for MJ=0\u0002, respectively.\nCare must be taken to use bound-state calculations for the\ncorrect values of MJ and parity. In the present case, we want\ns-wave resonances, with L=0 in the incoming channel. This\nrequires MJ=mj and even parity. Bound-state calculations\nwith different values of MJ produce energies that cross\nthreshold at different values of the field. In He-NH, which is\na very weakly coupled system with almost linear Zeeman\neffects, the fields are only slightly different; for example, the\ncrossing with the ms=0 threshold occurs at 14 345.40 G for\nMJ=\u22121. Nevertheless, the difference can easily be enough to\nmiss the resonance, and in more strongly coupled systems\nwill be crucial.\nFor 3He colliding with NH \u0001ms=\u22121\u0002 near 7169 G, only\nelastic scattering can occur. For MJ=\u22121 and even parity, the\npresent basis set gives three open channels with L=0, 2, and\n4. Scattering into the L\u00130 channels is strongly suppressed\nby the centrifugal barriers. The elastic cross section is shown\nas a function of field in Fig. 5 and the corresponding eigen-\nphase sum and scattering length are shown in Figs. 6 and 7.\nThe peak in the cross section for kinetic energy Ekin\n=10\u22126 K is close to the value of 4\n \/k2=1.2\r108 \u00c52 char-\nacteristic of a pole in the scattering length. The peak shows\nan asymmetric Fano line shape \u000368\u0004, with interference be-\ntween a background term and a resonant term that interfere\nconstructively on the low-field side of the resonance and de-\nstructively on the high-field side. The diagonal S-matrix ele-\nment for L=0 describes a circle of radius 1 in the complex\nplane as the field is ramped across the resonance, as shown in\nFig. 8. Fitting the eigenphase sum to Eq. \u000131\u0002 gives \u000bbg\n\u00150.001, Bres=7168.7555 G, and \u0019B=\u22121.65\r10\u22125 G, while\n10\u22124\n10\u22122\n100\n102\n104\n106\n108\n7168.750 7168.755 7168.760 7168.765\nCr\nos\ns \nse\nct\nio\nn \n(\u00c52\n)\nMagnetic Field (G)\nEkin = 1.0 \u00b5K ms = \u22121, ms\u2019 = \u22121\nFIG. 5. \u0001Color online\u0002 Elastic \u0001ms=\u22121\u2192\u22121\u0002 cross section for\n3He-NH collisions in the vicinity of an elastic Feshbach resonance\nat a kinetic energy of 10\u22126 K.\nMAYKEL LEONARDO GONZ\u00c1LEZ-MART\u00cdNEZ AND JEREMY M. HUTSON PHYSICAL REVIEW A 75, 022702 \u00012007\u0002\n022702-8\nfitting the scattering length to Eq. \u000133\u0002 gives abg=3.19 \u00c5,\nBres=7168.7555 G, and \u000eB=8.04\r10\u22123 G. The widths \u0019B\nand \u000eB are related by \u0019B \/2=\u2212kabg\u000eB. It may be seen that the\nbound-state calculation does indeed give a very precise esti-\nmate of the position of the zero-energy resonance.\nFor 3He colliding with NH \u0001ms=0\u0002 near 14 300 G, both\nelastic and inelastic scattering are possible. For MJ=0 and\neven parity, our basis set gives three elastic channels \u0001ms\n=0 with L=0, 2, and 4\u0002 and two inelastic channels \u0001ms=\u22121\nwith L=2 and 4\u0002. However, the elastic channels with L\u00130\nmake no significant contributions at ultralow energies. Figure\n9 shows scans of the elastic \u0001ms=0\u21920\u0002 and total inelastic\n\u0001ms=0\u2192\u22121\u0002 cross sections for kinetic energies of 10\u22126 and\n10\u22123 K. Once again the bound-state calculation gives a very\nprecise estimate of the position of the zero-energy resonance.\nAt 10\u22123 K the resonance is shifted slightly because a differ-\nent field is needed to bring the bound state into resonance\nwith the larger total energy. Apart from the shift, however,\nthe cross sections behave as expected from the Wigner\nthreshold laws: the elastic cross section is almost unchanged\nand the inelastic cross section scales with k\u22121.\nA notable feature of Fig. 9 is that the elastic cross section\ndoes not peak at the very high value of 4\n \/k2 characteristic\nof a pole in the scattering length. The real and imaginary\nparts of the scattering length are shown in Fig. 10. Instead of\nrising to \u001a, the scattering length oscillates with a peak at less\nthan +8 \u00c5. The eigenphase sum shows a sharp drop through\n\n as shown in Fig. 11, and fitting to Eq. \u000131\u0002 gives Bres\n=14 340.371 G and \u0019B=\u22125.72\r10\u22123 G. However, the phase\nchange is distributed between several diagonal matrix ele-\nments.\nThe S-matrix elements are shown explicitly for two dif-\nferent energies Ekin=10\u22126 and 4\r10\u22126 K, in Figs. 12 and 13.\nThe corresponding values of k differ by a factor of 2. It may\nbe seen in Fig. 12 that the elastic S-matrix element for the\nlow-energy incoming channel describes a small circle with a\nradius that depends linearly on k. For Ekin=10\u22126 K, the ra-\ndius is only about 0.003. The other diagonal elements de-\nscribe much larger circles that are almost independent of k,\nwith background \u0001nonresonant\u0002 S-matrix elements \u0001shown by\ncrosses\u0002 that are far from 1: these channels have substantial\nkinetic energy so are not governed by the Wigner threshold\nlaws. The inelastic S-matrix elements are shown in Fig. 13,\nand it may be seen that those for incoming channel 0 de-\nscribe circles with radii proportional to k1\/2.\nSince S00 describes a small circle in the complex plane,\nthe corresponding complex phase \u000b given by Eq. \u000121\u0002 shows\na relatively small oscillation that does not pass through\n\u00b1\n \/2.

It has been com-\nmon in theoretical studies of atom-atom scattering to model\nFeshbach resonances using a two-channel treatment with one\nclosed and one open channel. The present results make it\nclear that such an approximation may miss essential features\nof the physics, and in particular may predict unphysical poles\nin the scattering length.\nThe expression for the inelastic rate coefficient kinel cor-\nresponding to Eq. \u000140\u0002 is\nkinel = \u000f\u0006k\n\u0007\n\u0010\u0016ineltot \u0001B\u0002 \u0011 \u000f2h\u0007 \u0010 ares\u00032\u0001B \u2212 Bres\u0002\/\u0019Binel\u00042 + 1 .\n\u000141\u0002\nThis is independent of kinetic energy except for the depen-\ndence of Bres on Ekin.

For He-NH near the 14 340 G resonance this\ngives a peak value kinel\nmax\n=2.84\r10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121.\nFeshbach resonances with L\u00130 in the incoming channel\ncan also occur, but are suppressed at ultralow energies be-\ncause of the centrifugal barrier. 3He-NH has a very low re-\nduced mass, and with a long-range potential given by\n\u2212C6R\u22126 with C6=7.84Eha0\n6 the heights and positions of the\ncentrifugal barriers for L=1\u20134 are given in Table I. Because\nof this, no zero-energy resonance was observed for MJ=\u22121\nnear 14 345 G, even though there is a state that crosses the\nthreshold there.\nWe should emphasize the advantage of using coupled-\nchannel methods rather than basis-set methods for bound\nstates when attempting to locate zero-energy Feshbach reso-\nnances. Basis-set methods lose accuracy close to dissociation\nbecause of the difficulty of representing near-dissociation\nand continuum functions with basis sets. In coupled-channel\nmethods, by contrast, the behavior of the wave function at\nlong range can be built in by applying WKB boundary con-\nditions at Rmax. Because of this, the approximations in the\nbound-state calculations are very similar to those in scatter-\ning calculations with the same basis set, and as we have\nshown this allows very precise estimates of resonance posi-\ntions.\nVI. RELATIVE MERITS OF DIFFERENT BASIS SETS\nThe coupled and uncoupled basis sets give identical re-\nsults for bound-state energies and for collision properties,\nand in this sense they are equivalent. However, the un-\ncoupled basis set is a little easier to program and its matrix\nelements are easier to generalize to more complicated cases\n\u0001such as those involving nuclear spin or two structured\nmonomers\u0002. In addition, the uncoupled basis set gives a\nmuch simpler representation of the wave functions for bound\nstates and resonances in any significant magnetic field. We\ntherefore intend to use uncoupled basis sets in future work.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have modified the BOUND and MOLSCAT packages to\nallow the use of basis sets in which the asymptotic Hamil-\ntonian is nondiagonal and used this capability to perform\nbound-state and scattering calculations on He-NH in the\npresence of a magnetic field. The bound-state capability\nmakes it possible to locate zero-energy Feshbach resonances\nas a function of magnetic field even when they are very\nnarrow. It provides a very straightforward way to program\nnew coupling cases and collision types, and in future work\nwe will use it to investigate low-energy scattering of systems\ncontaining two structured monomers in electric and magnetic\nfields.\nFor He-NH, we have located two zero-energy Feshbach\nresonances involving an ms= +1 level of the He-NH com-\nplex tuned through the ms=\u22121 and ms=0 thresholds. The two\nresonances show very different behavior as a function of\nmagnetic field. For the resonance at the ms=\u22121 threshold,\nonly elastic scattering is possible and the resonance shows\nthe classic behavior familiar from ultracold atom-atom scat-\ntering. The scattering length passes through a pole at reso-\nnance and the elastic cross section shows a very large peak.\nFor the resonance at the ms=0 threshold, however, inelastic\nscattering is also possible. The pole in the scattering length is\ndramatically suppressed, and the peak in the elastic cross\nsection is far smaller than would be expected if a pole were\npresent.\nOur results provide a numerical demonstration of the ef-\nfects recently predicted by Hutson \u000351\u0004, who parametrized\nthe strength of the resonant contribution with a resonant scat-\ntering length ares. If ares is very large, the scattering length\nshows polelike behavior and there are very large peaks in\ncross sections. Conversely, if ares is small, the pole is sup-\npressed and the peaks in cross sections are relatively small. A\nlarge value of ares occurs only if the state responsible for the\nresonance is coupled much more weakly to the inelastic\nchannels than to the elastic channel. For the inelastic reso-\nnance that we have characterized in He-NH, the couplings to\nthe elastic and inelastic channels are comparable and the\nresonant scattering length is only 8.96 \u00c5.\nThe suppression of resonant peaks in cross sections by\ninelastic scattering applies to any parameter that tunes reso-\nnances through zero energy. In particular, the strong sensitiv-\nity of low-energy cross sections to details of potential energy\nsurfaces arises mostly because small changes in the potential\ncan move resonances across threshold. If the resonant peaks\nare strongly suppressed, the sensitivity to details of the po-\ntential will be much reduced. This effect explains previously\npuzzling results in Na+Na2 \u000369\u0004 and Li+Li2 \u000364\u0004 reactive\nscattering, where it was found that cross sections for ultra-\nMAYKEL LEONARDO GONZ\u00c1LEZ-MART\u00cdNEZ AND JEREMY M. HUTSON PHYSICAL REVIEW A 75, 022702 \u00012007\u0002\n022702-12\ncold collisions of vibrationally excited molecules with v\n\u00142 are only weakly dependent on potential parameters and\nshow no sharp peaks when Feshbach resonances are tuned\nthrough zero energy. Even for v=1, the cross sections oscil-\nlate by only about a factor of 10 as a function of potential\nparameters. The lack of large resonant peaks in these systems\nis now seen to be due to suppression by fast inelastic pro-\ncesses.\nThere are other systems where the suppression is much\nweaker and sharp peaks are still observed. For example,\nBodo et al. \u000370\u0004 explored F+H2 reactive scattering as a func-\ntion of reduced mass and observed polelike behavior in the\nscattering length when resonances were tuned through zero\nenergy. In this case the resonances are in the entrance chan-\nnel of the reaction, and their coupling to the exoergic \u0001reac-\ntive\u0002 channels is suppressed by the presence of a high barrier.\nUnder these circumstances the poles are not strongly sup-\npressed and there are large peaks in cross sections.\nThe sensitivity of elastic and inelastic cross sections to\ndetails of the potential energy surface thus depends on the\nbalance between elastic and inelastic couplings. In systems\nwhere the resonances are strongly coupled to inelastic chan-\nnels, cross sections will be much less sensitive to potential\ndetails than was previously expected.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to the Royal Society for an Inter-\nnational Joint Project grant which made this collaboration\npossible and to Marko Cvita\u0161 and Pavel Sold\u00e1n for com-\nments on the manuscript.\n\u00031\u0004 J.
