Economists have developed \na range of theories to account for delegation, \nbut there is less empirical evidence, especially \nacross countries. This has limited the ability to \nunderstand the phenomenon of decentraliza-\ntion. To address this empirical lacuna we have \ndeveloped a research program to measure the \ninternal organization of firms\u2014including their \ndecentralization decisions\u2014across a large range \nof industries and countries.\nIn this paper we investigate whether greater \nproduct market competition increases decen-\ntralization. For example, tougher competition \nmay make local managers\u2019 information more \nvaluable, as delays to decisions become more \ncostly. Since globalization and liberalization \nhave increased the competitiveness of product \nmarkets, one explanation for the trend towards \ndecentralization could be increased competi-\ntion. Of course there are a range of other fac-\ntors that may also be at play, including human \ncapital (Eve Caroli and John Van Reenen 2001), \ninformation and communication technology (Timothy Bresnahan, Erik Brynjolfsson, and \nLorin Hitt 2002), culture (Bloom, Sadun, and \nVan Reenen 2009), and industrial composition.\nTo tackle these issues we collected detailed \ninformation on the internal organization of firms \nacross nations. The few datasets that exist are \neither from a single industry1 or (at best) across \n1 For example, Luis Garicano and Tom Hubbard (2007) \non legal services.\nDoes Product Market Competition Lead Firms to Decentralize?\nBy Nicholas Bloom, Raffaella Sadun, and John Van Reenen*\nmany firms in a single country.2 We  analyze \ndata on almost 4,000 firms across 12 countries \nin Europe, North America and Asia. We find \nthat competition does indeed seem to foster \ngreater decentralization.\nI.\u2002 Some\u2002Theories\nA number of papers such as Philippe Aghion \nand Jean Tirole (1997), George Baker, Robert \nGibbons, and Kevin Murphy (1999), Canice \nPrendergast (2002), and Oliver Hart and John \nMoore (2004), consider the delegation decision \nin the context of an information-based approach. \nFor example, Acemoglu et al. (2007) examine a \nmodel where a firm faces a choice over whether \nto adopt a new technology. The principal is the \nCentral Head Quarters (CHQ) and the agent is \nthe plant manager. The CHQ has a greater inter-\nest in maximizing the firm\u2019s value than the man-\nager, but the manager has greater local private \nknowledge than the CHQ. Characteristics of the \nenvironment that increase: (i) the value of local \ninformation; and (ii) the congruence of incen-\ntives between the CHQ and plant manager, will \nincrease decentralization.\nHow does competition affect this trade-off? \nThere are several reasons to expect the relation-\nship between competition and decentralization \nto be positive. First, if competition reduces the \nagency problem, then delegation is more likely \nas incentives are more aligned. This could be \nbecause (i) managers work harder to avoid \nbankruptcy; (ii) competition fosters a greater \nsensitivity of profits to relative differences \nin managerial effort, or (iii) if there are more \n2 See, for example, Daron Acemoglu et al. (2007) for \nFrance and the United Kingdom; Massimo Colombo and \nMarco Delmastro (2004) and Jakub Kastl, David Martimort \nand Salvatore Piccolo (2008) for Italy. The paper closest to \nours is Maria Guadalupe and Julie Wulf (forthcoming) who \nuse panel data for the United States and a trade liberaliza-\ntion to identify a postive causal impact of competition on \nfirm delayering.\n* Bloom: Department of Economics, Stanford University, \n578 Serra Mall, Palo Alto, CA 94350 and CEP and NBER \n(e-mail: nbloom@stanford.edu); Sadun: Graduate School of \nBusiness, Harvard University, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA \n02163 and CEP (e-mail: rsadun@hbs.edu); Van Reenen: \nDepartment of Economics, London School of Economics, \nHoughton Street, London, WC2A 2AE and CEP, CEPR, \nand NBER (e-mail: j.vanreenen@lse.ac.uk).\nVOL. 100 NO. 2 435DOES PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION LEAD FIRMS TO DECENTRALIZE?\nfirms then it is easier to implement yardstick \ncompetition.\nRicardo Alonso, Wouter Dessein, and Niko \nMatouschek (2009) emphasize the incentive to \ncentralize to overcome within-firm spillovers. For \nexample, when a firm has two plants selling sepa-\nrate substitutable products, local plant managers \nwill tend to set a price that is too low from the \nfirm\u2019s perspective, as the cannibalization effect is \nnot internalized. Tougher competition will make \nthe loss from this cannibalization smaller though, \nas price cost margins fall. So long as there is some \nincentive to delegate because of local information \nadvantages, the incentive to decentralize rises as \ncompetition increases.\nThere are also competitive forces working \nagainst decentralization. On the incentives\/\nagency side, greater competition may actually \nreduce managerial effort, as smaller mark-\nups mean that the incentive to exert greater \nmanagerial effort to raise firm profitability is \nblunted. This is a variety of the well-known \n\u201cSchumpeterian\u201d effect on innovation\u2014lower \nquasi-rents reduce incentives to take activities \nthat lower marginal costs. On the information \nside, if competition increases the number of \nfirms, then there will be more public informa-\ntion, so in the Acemoglu et al. (2007) model the \nprincipal can learn from observing other firms \nand take more decisions directly.\nUltimately, the effect of competition on \ndecentralization is an empirical issue. To look at \nthis question using our organizational data, we \nestimate models of the form:\n(1)  Dijc\u2002 =\u2002 \u03b2COMPijc\u2002+\u2002\u03b4\u2032xijc\u2002+\u2002uijc\nwhere D and COMP are indicators for decen-\ntralization and product market competition for \nplant i in industry j in country c, x is a vector of \nother controls (including country and industry \ndummies) and uijc is an error term.\nII.\u2002 Data\nWe collected data on almost 4,000 medium \nsized (100 to 5,000 employees) manufacturing \nfirms across a dozen countries, which we briefly \ndescribe here.\nA. Measuring Decentralization\nWe investigated the decentralization of deci-\nsion making from the CEO to the plant manager. \nThe plant manager is the most senior person \nat the factory level, so his autonomy from the \nCEO, who is typically based in the corporate \nheadquarters, is a natural measure of decentral-\nization. To quantify this we measured decentral-\nization along four dimensions. First, how much \ncapital investment could a plant manager under-\ntake without prior authorization from the cor-\nporate headquarters? Second, how much control \ndoes the plant manager have in hiring a new full-\ntime permanent shop-floor employee? Third, \nhow much control does the plant manager have \nover introducing new products? Fourth, how \nmuch control does the manager have over sales \nand marketing decisions? These last three mea-\nsures were scaled from a score of one, defined \nas all decisions taken at the corporate headquar-\nters, to a five defined as all decisions taken at the \nplant (decentralization). Since the scaling may \nvary across all these questions, we converted \nall four measures to z-scores (mean zero, unit \nstandard deviation) and in our baseline took the \naverage of the four z-scores. We also collected \ninformation on management practices (follow-\ning Bloom and Van Reenen 2007), the propor-\ntion of employees with college degrees, the \naverage hours worked and the gender and age \nbreakdown. From the sample database we also \nhave information for most firms on accounting \nvariables like sales and the capital stock.\nB. Collecting Accurate Responses\nTo obtain truthful responses we took a number \nof steps. First, the survey was conducted by tele-\nphone without telling the managers they were \nbeing scored on organizational practices. This \nenabled scoring to be based on the interviewer\u2019s \nevaluation of the firm\u2019s actual practices, rather \nthan its aspirations, the manager\u2019s perceptions \nor the interviewer\u2019s impressions. To run this \n\u201cblind\u201d scoring we used open questions (i.e., \u201cTo \nhire a full-time permanent shop-floor worker \nwhat agreement would your plant need from \ncorporate headquarters?\u201d), rather than closed \nquestions (i.e., \u201cCan you hire workers without \nauthority from corporate headquarters?\u201d [yes\/\nno]). Following the initial question the discus-\nsion would continue until the interviewer can \nmake an accurate assessment of the firm\u2019s typi-\ncal practices. For example, if the plant manager \nresponded \u201cIt is my decision, but I need sign-off \nfrom corporate HQ,\u201d the interviewer would ask \nMAY 2010436 AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\u201cHow often would sign-off typically be given?\u201d \nand \u201cCan you give me any examples when that \nsign-off has not been given?\u201d Second, the inter-\nviewers were not told anything about the firm\u2019s \nfinancial information or performance in advance \nof the interview. Since the firms (the median size \n270 employees) are too small to attract much \nmedia coverage, this should mean the interview-\ners had no preconceptions about the firms before \nthey interviewed them. Third, each interviewer \nran 85 interviews on average, allowing us to \nremove interviewer fixed effects. Fourth, the \nsurvey instrument was targeted at plant man-\nagers, who are typically senior enough to have \nan overview of organizational practices but not \nso senior as to be detached from day-to-day \noperations. Fifth, we collected a detailed set of \ninformation on the interview process itself (e.g., \nlocal time of day), the manager (e.g., national-\nity), and on the interviewer. These survey met-\nrics are used as \u201cnoise controls\u201d to help reduce \nresidual variation. Finally, to maximize compa-\nrability every interviewer also had the same ini-\ntial three days of interview training to ensure a \ncommon interpretation of the scoring grid. The \nteam operated from one location and interview-\ners surveyed firms across multiple countries, so \nfor example, an English and French speaking \ninterviewer would interview firms in France, the \nUnited Kingdom and the United States.\nC. Descriptive Statistics\nIntriguingly, we found that firms in devel-\noping countries (Brazil, China, and India), \ntended to be the most centralized, with almost \nall major decisions taken by the owners in the \ncorporate headquarters (see Bloom, Sadun, \nand Van Reenen 2009). Japanese firms were \nalso relatively centralized. In contrast, firms \nin Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian countries (Canada, Germany, Sweden, United Kingdom, \nand United States) were relatively decentral-\nized. The rest of Europe (e.g., France, Italy, and \nPoland) tended to be in the middle of the decen-\ntralization ranking.\nIII.\u2002 Results\nTable 1 examines the association between \ndecentralization and different measures of prod-\nuct market competition, revealing a robustly \n positive relationship. We use three different \nproxies for product market competition follow-\ning Steve Nickell (1996) and Philippe Aghion et \nal. (2005).\nThe first measure is the degree of import \npenetration in the country by two-digit indus-\ntry measured as the share of total imports over \ndomestic production. This is constructed for \nthe five-year period 1999\u20132003 to remove any \npotential contemporaneous feedback. The sec-\nond is the country by three-digit industry Lerner \nindex of competition, which is (1 \u2212 profits\/\nsales), calculated as the average across the entire \nfirm level database (excluding the firms in the \nsurvey). Again, this is constructed for the five-\nyear period 2000\u20132004 to remove any potential \ncontemporaneous feedback.3 The third measure \nof competition is the manager\u2019s response to the \nsurvey question on the number of competitors a \nfirm faces, valued zero for \u201cno competitors,\u201d one \nfor \u201cbetween one and five competitors,\u201d and two \nfor \u201cfive or more competitors.\u201d \nReassuringly, whichever measure of competi-\ntion we use, we still find a very strong and robust \nrelationship between more competition and \ngreater levels of decentralization. In column 1, \nhigher import competition is positively and sig-\nnificantly associated with greater decentraliza-\ntion. In column 2 we include controls for skills, \nsize, multinational status, country dummies \nand three-digit industry dummies and find this \nresult appears to be robust to these additional \nexplanatory variables. In terms of these other \ncovariates, we find that larger firms and plants, \nespecially those belonging to foreign multina-\ntionals, are more likely to delegate, potentially \nbecause of greater operational complexity and \nthe importance of local knowledge. Plants with \nhigher levels of human capital are more likely \nto be autonomous, presumably because more \neducated employees are better able to effec-\ntively run their own plants. Finally, in other \nrecent work we have found that plants located \nin regions with higher trust and less hierarchical \nreligions are also likely to be autonomous (see \nBloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2009, for more \nanalysis of these cultural issues).4\n3 The difference in timing between the import penetra-\ntion measure and the Lerner index is due to the fact that \nthe accounting data is available until 2004 but the OECD \nimport competition data is available only until 2003.\n4 In this specification all competition results in Table 1 \nare robust to the inclusion of trust and hierarchical religion \nVOL. 100 NO. 2 437DOES PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION LEAD FIRMS TO DECENTRALIZE?\nIn columns 3 and 4 we run an identical spec-\nification, but instead use the lagged industry-\nlevel (inverse) Lerner index as an alternative \nmeasure of competition. We again find a sig-\nnificant and positive association between com-\npetition and decentralization without and with \nthe full set of controls. Finally, in columns \n5 and 6 we run another similar specification \nusing the plant manager\u2019s own self-reported \nmeasure of the perceived number of competi-\ntors. Again we find a positive and significant \nassociation with and without the full set of \ncontrols. This reveals that the more rivals a \nfirm perceives it faces, the more decentralized \nit appears to be. \nIn summary, we find a highly significant and \nrobust relationship between more competition \nand greater firm-level decentralization. The \ncontrols. With these included, the coefficients (standard \nerrors) of the competition variables are 0.154 (0.067), 2.920 \n(1.119), and 0.099 (0.031) in columns 2, 4, and 6 respec-\ntively. Similarly, the results are robust to the inclusion of \na summary management measure (see Bloom and Van \nReenen 2007 for details). In this specification the coef-\nficients (standard errors) of the competition variables are \n0.173 (0.073), 1.591 (0.872), and 0.067 (0.034) in columns \n2, 4, and 6 respectively.\nmagnitude of these competition effects is also \nof economic as well as statistical significance. \nFor example, in column 6 increasing the num-\nber of competitors from zero to five is associated \nwith an increase in the decentralization index of \nabout 0.2, equivalent to going from a relatively \ndecentralized European country like Germany \nto a very decentralized country like the United \nStates.\nIV.\u2002 Conclusions\nWe have addressed the question of whether \ncompetition fosters delegation by assembling \na new dataset on about 4,000 firms across \n12 countries that measures the delegation of \nauthority from Central Head Quarters to local \nplant managers. We find that competition is \nassociated with a greater degree of delega-\ntion. This suggests that one of the reasons for \nthe move towards decentralization over time \nin the developed countries may be increasing \ncompetition, possibly arising from more glo-\nbalized product markets. It also implies that \na reason for the greater centralization in less \ndeveloped countries may be lower competitive \nintensity.\nTable 1\u2014Competition and Decentralization\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nImport penetration 0.131** 0.183**\n\u2003 (3 years lagged) (0.050) (0.073)\nLerner competition index 5.705** 1.763**\n\u2003 (2 years lagged) (0.850) (0.878)\nNumber of competitors 0.120** 0.093**\n\u2003 (0 =\u2003\u201cNone\u201d, 1 =\u2003\u201c1 to 4\u201d; 2 =\u2003\u201c5+\u201d) (0.035) (0.034)\nPlant skills 0.080** 0.082** 0.083**\n Percent employees with a college degree (0.018) (0.017) (0.016)\nFirm size 0.081** 0.068** 0.066**\n Ln(firm employment) (0.027) (0.019) (0.018)\nPlant employment 0.125** 0.088** 0.086**\n Ln(Plant employees as a % of firm employment) (0.023) (0.024) (0.022)\nForeign multinational 0.131** 0.106** 0.115**\n Firm belongs to a foreign multinational (0.048) (0.041) (0.042)\nObservations 2,508 2,508 3,698 3,698 3,698 3,698\nControls No Yes No Yes No Yes\nNotes: OLS estimates.
