This is an open access article and it is also freely accessible from the publisher's website at: http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/humu.21469\/abstract ; DOI: 10.1002\/humu.21469Explosive growth in the generation of genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) data necessitates a concerted effort to tackle the logistical and informatics challenges this presents. The GEN2PHEN Project represents one such effort, with a broad strategy of uniting disparate G2P resources into a hybrid centralized-federated network. This is achieved through a holistic strategy focussed on three overlapping areas: data input standards and pipelines through which to submit and collect data (data in); federated, independent, extendable, yet interoperable database platforms on which to store and curate widely diverse datasets (data storage); and data formats and mechanisms with which to exchange, combine, and extract data (data exchange and output).

The GEN2PHEN Project represents one such\neffort, with a broad strategy of uniting disparate G2P\nresources into a hybrid centralized-federated network. This\nis achieved through a holistic strategy focussed on three\noverlapping areas: data input standards and pipelines\nthrough which to submit and collect data (data in);\nfederated, independent, extendable, yet interoperable\ndatabase platforms on which to store and curate widely\ndiverse datasets (data storage); and data formats and\nmechanisms with which to exchange, combine, and extract\ndata (data exchange and output). To fully leverage this data\nnetwork, we have constructed the \u2018\u2018G2P Knowledge\nCentre\u2019\u2019 (http:\/\/www.gen2phen.org). This central platform\nprovides holistic searching of the G2P data domain allied\nwith facilities for data annotation and user feedback, access\nto extensive G2P and informatics resources, and tools for\nconstructing online working communities centered on the\nG2P domain. Through the efforts of GEN2PHEN, and\nthrough combining data with broader community-derived\nknowledge, the Knowledge Centre opens up exciting\npossibilities for organizing, integrating, sharing, and inter-\npreting new waves of G2P data in a collaborative fashion.\nHum Mutat 32:543\u2013550, 2011. & 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\nKEY WORDS: genotype\u2013phenotype; association; GWAS;\ninformatics; database; integration; Web services; variation\nThe Problem Domain\nLife sciences are being transformed by a tremendous growth in\nthe scale and complexity of new data and knowledge, reflecting an\nera of unprecedented technology development that is enabling\nincreasingly high-throughput and low-cost experimentation. This\nis all part of a \u2018\u2018multiomics\u2019\u2019 approach to research and the veritable\ninformation bonanza it brings, but this, however, is a double-\nedged sword. Certainly, the resulting genomics, transcriptomics,\nproteomics, metabolomics, and other large datasets promise\ngreatly improved understanding of biological processes, and\ntranslational application thereof. But such progress will depend\nupon scientists being able to organize, integrate, share, and\ninterpret this wealth of new information in sophisticated and\neffective ways. Meeting this challenge is far from trivial, and to the\nextent we fail in this endeavor we risk missing potential\ndiscoveries and, even more critically, missing the truth and\ndrawing false conclusions. Obvious examples of such problems\nfrom the field of genetic association analysis would include: not\nbeing able to account for publication bias when aggregating\ndatasets; employing too little phenotype data to distinguish\nbetween similar phenotypes with differing etiologies; and\nperforming meta-analysis without being able to incorporate\ninformation about differences in population environments or\nhaplotype structures. New systems biology studies and other\nprojects that consider data across multiple omics disciplines are\neven more vulnerable to such confounding influences.\nThe myriad problems involved in properly managing and\nexploiting today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s life science data relate to things\nsuch as the fragmentation of data across hundreds of hetero-\ngeneous databases, the lack of standardization, the inconsistent\nidentification of biological objects and concepts [Goble and\nStevens, 2008], poor enabling of resource discovery [Cannata\net al., 2005], difficulties in facilitating data quality assurance and\ncuration [Howe et al., 2008], and approaches to promoting\nextensive and yet ethically and culturally acceptable data sharing\n[Walport and Brest, 2011; Wellcome Trust, 2011]. There is also a\nneed for more effective representation of scientific knowledge\ndistilled from research data, and for linking data and other\nresearch objects into future modalities for semantic publishing\n[Bourne, 2005, 2010; Neylon, 2009; Shotton et al., 2009].\nFurthermore, as the real and virtual worlds of science increasingly\nmerge so that research is \u2018\u2018done\u2019\u2019 not just \u2018\u2018reported\u2019\u2019 online, there\nis a need to come up with completely new paradigms for\nsocioscientific interaction in the digital age [Stafford, 2010], to\npromote highly collaborative and interactive modes of Internet-\nbased scholarly debate and communication.\nIn this present communication, to explore and illustrate the\nchallenges and current progress in some of the areas listed above,\nwe will concentrate our focus upon the science of genotype-to-\nphenotype (G2P) relationships in human and model organisms.\nEven within this one domain there are many multidimensional\nchallenges to be tackled. On a very basic level, the massive data\nvolumes generated by next-generation sequencing instruments\npresent major informatics challenges for smaller laboratories that\nutilize these devices (either locally or via external service\nproviders), and this considerably curtails the scientific impact\nthat these new technologies are having [Editors, 2008]. More\ngenerally, scientists are facing the herculean task of reporting,\ncataloging, and managing the seemingly limitless number of G2P\ninteractions being identified by research and diagnostic laboratories\nOFFICIAL JOURNAL\nwww.hgvs.org\n& 2011 WILEY-LISS, INC.\nContract grant sponsor: European Community\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme\n(FP7\/2007\u20132013); Contract grant number: 200754\u2014The GEN2PHEN Project.\n\u0002Correspondence to: Adam J. Webb, Department of Genetics, University of\nLeicester, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK. E-mail: ajw51@leicester.ac.uk\non a daily basis. For example, according to the NHGRI GWAS\nCatalog [Hindorff et al., 2009] (http:\/\/www.genome.gov\/gwastudies\/),\ngenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published at\na rate of approximately five research articles per week during the\npast 2 years\u2014but because partial or negative studies are generally\nnot reported, then even this number is a substantial underestimate\nof the true frequency at which genetic association findings are\nbeing produced. Similarly, diagnostic labs routinely perform many\nDNA mutation scans on patients with traits that have a heritable\ncomponent, but very little of this information ever gets to be\nreleased and utilized by others. Furthermore, there are many other\npressing challenges relating to G2P data, not least ethical, legal,\nand social issues relevant to promoting and achieving the sharing\nof potentially identifiable data from human subjects [Kaye et al.,\n2009, 2010; Povey et al., 2010].\nTackling G2P Data Challenges\nTraditional approaches to biological databasing have been\nmostly based on the \u2018\u2018centralized\u2019\u2019 model, characterized by\ngathering data into a large central hub for storage, integration,\nand display. Historically, this strategy has proved highly successful.\nExamples include the global collaboration of nucleotide sequence\narchives (http:\/\/www.insdc.org) established in the 1980s, and\nsophisticated resources for data analysis and visualization\nprovided by bioinformatics centers such as NCBI (http:\/\/\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), UCSC (http:\/\/genome.ucsc.edu), and\nEBI\/EMBL (http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk). However, as we argued else-\nwhere [Thorisson et al., 2008b], centralization alone is insufficient\nfor dealing with the full quantitative breadth and qualitative depth\nof contemporary G2P data, and so hybrid models combining\ncentralized databases with \u2018\u2018federated\u2019\u2019 networks of distributed\ndata and analytical resources are required to tackle the new\nchallenges facing the G2P data field.\nFederation of data storage, provision, and analysis across sites is\nwell established in some other scientific disciplines that have a\nlonger history of dealing with \u2018\u2018big data,\u2019\u2019 such as astronomy and\nparticle physics, and it is also a cornerstone of data-intensive\nscientific research, or e-Science [Buetow, 2005; Hey and Trefethen,\n2005]. Increasingly, such projects employ Web service-based grid\ncomputing to enable automated resource discovery and data\nanalysis. A prominent example is the multi-institutional caBIG\nproject (https:\/\/cabig.nci.nih.gov), which has constructed a\ncentrally managed and tightly integrated network designed to\nseamlessly link dozens of cancer research institutions in the United\nStates and internationally [Buetow, 2009; Saltz et al., 2006].\nAnother example based on many of the same technologies but\nwith a contrasting, decentralized style is the UK-based myGrid\nfamily of tools [Bhagat et al., 2010; Goble et al., 2010; Hull et al.,\n2006; Oinn et al., 2004] (http:\/\/www.mygrid.org.uk).\nUnfortunately, the majority projects and institutions that\nproduce and analyze G2P data do not participate in these\nfederated and open grid initiatives. Hence, there is a real problem\nin ensuring that all their valuable data and discoveries become\nshared and merged into the online universe of G2P information.\nTo help enable this, and to promote and support blended\nfederated-centralized approaches to G2P data exploitation in\ngeneral, a 5-year Genotype to Phenotype databasing (GEN2-\nPHEN) project was launched at the start of 2008, via a h12 M\naward under the European Community\u2019s Seventh Framework\nProgramme (FP7: http:\/\/cordis.europa.eu\/fp7\/). GEN2PHEN spe-\ncifically aims to help establish holistic access to G2P information,\nthrough modular tool and data standards developments toward a\nfederated network of online G2P resources, and simultaneously to\nfacilitate the bidirectional flow of knowledge between public G2P\ndatabases and G2P researchers. Below, we provide a broad\noverview of the GEN2PHEN project and provide details of one\nof its main deliverables: the \u2018\u2018G2P Knowledge Centre\u2019\u2019\u2014an\nintegrated G2P community Website, information resource, tool\nrepository, and comprehensive data access portal.\nThe GEN2PHEN Project\nThe GEN2PHEN consortium is made up of representatives from\n25 research organizations and companies based in 10 countries in\nEurope, in Saudi Arabia, and in India (see full list of partners at\nhttp:\/\/www.gen2phen.org\/about\/partners), providing exceptional\ncompetence and broad expertise in various aspects of G2P data\nmanagement and exploitation. Their common goal is to improve the\neffectiveness of G2P databasing, described as \u2018\u2018disastrously deficient\u2019\u2019\nin a review written shortly before the project\u2019s conception [Patrinos\nand Brookes, 2005]. In practice, this means enabling heterogeneous\nand largely unconnected G2P data resources to evolve toward a\ncomprehensive \u2018\u2018G2P biomedical knowledge environment.\u2019\u2019\nThe Strategy\nMost GEN2PHEN activities are assembled around three core,\npractical aspects of G2P databasing: (1) devising data standards\nand pipelines for submitting and collecting data, (2) designing and\ndeploying federated and interoperable modular components for\nstoring and curating diverse datasets, and (3) solutions for\nexchanging, integrating, and extracting information from the\nresulting network of federated and centralized databases. Con-\nsortium partners all have solid track records in some or all of these\nareas and are well connected with the broader G2P community.\nThis latter point is essential for aligning and codeveloping\nGEN2PHEN solutions with those of other allied projects, often\nvia close collaboration. Indeed, consultation, outreach, and\ndissemination involving the wider G2P community and beyond\nwas prioritized from the very outset of the project.\nDetails of specific GEN2PHEN objectives, planned and\ncompleted deliverables, ongoing activities, and other related\ninformation are all published online (http:\/\/www.gen2phen.org\/\nabout) and so they will not be elaborated here in detail. Instead,\nthis section briefly summarizes the main areas where GEN2PHEN\nis currently focusing its effort, listing several projects as examples.\nStandards Development\nTo facilitate resource interoperability and enable seamless G2P data\nexchange and integration, it is vital to increase the overall level of\nstandardization in the field. To this end, GEN2PHEN has worked\nextensively with others toward developing, refining, and promoting\nkey G2P domain data standards. This includes conceptual models,\nontologies and nomenclature conventions, with an overall focus that\nentails coordinated \u2018\u2018bottom-up\u2019\u2019 standards creation by the commu-\nnity [Brazma et al., 2006; Quackenbush, 2006], rather than \u2018\u2018top-\ndown\u2019\u2019 impositional approaches and formal standardization proce-\ndures. Therefore, GEN2PHEN has much in common with, and has\nconnections to, related initiatives such as the Reporting Structure for\nBiological Investigations Working Groups (RSBI WGs; http:\/\/\nwww.mged.org\/Workgroups\/rsbi\/index.html) and Minimum Infor-\nmation for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI; http:\/\/\nwww.mibbi.org), which promote collaborative development of\n\u2018\u2018omics\u2019\u2019 reporting standards [Sansone et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2008].\n544 HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 32, No. 5, 543\u2013550, 2011\nExamples that embody GEN2PHEN\u2019s collaborative approach\nand success in the area of standards development include close\npartnering with the groups behind the PaGE-OM for G2P data\n[Brookes et al., 2009] (http:\/\/www.pageom.org), imminent\npublication of new core data models for phenotype data and\nlocus-specific database (LSDB) content, and a joint effort with the\nNCBI that has produced the Locus Reference Genomic (LRG:\nhttp:\/\/www.lrg-sequence.org) framework for standardized report-\ning of gene variants [Dalgleish et al., 2010] (see Box 1).\nBox 1.

Framework for standardized reporting of\ngene variants. http:\/\/www.lrg-sequence.org\nToward a Unified G2P Data Infrastructure\nThe main thrust of GEN2PHEN\u2019s infrastructural work is the\ncreation of a range of reusable databases and software tools, with\nan emphasis upon federation and Web services. Naturally, these\ncomponents are all standards compliant, and they provide the\nG2P community with a suite of technological building blocks for\ncreating new (or augment existing) data systems that can be\nincorporated into the globally emerging online network of G2P\nresources. Thereby, in combination with other databases, a fully\ninterconnected, interoperable, and transparently searchable uni-\nverse of G2P resources can be assembled, for manual and\nautomated data discovery and analysis, as represented in Figure 1.\nSimilar to the approach taken for standards development,\nGEN2PHEN favor collaborative, open-source software development\nand reuse\/adaption of existing software where possible. The power\nof this open, community-oriented approach, is shown by bioinfor-\nmatics software initiatives such as BioPerl [Stajich et al., 2002]\n(http:\/\/www.bioperl.org) and BioJava [Holland et al., 2008] (http:\/\/\nbiojava.org). Examples of GEN2PHEN projects in this arena\ninclude software packages for easy creation of LSDBs and close\npartnership with the team developing Molgenis (http:\/\/www.mol-\ngenis.org), an open-source platform for rapid prototyping of\ngenomics database software [Swertz et al., 2010] (see also Box 2).\nData Flow, Data Access, and Data Integration\nGEN2PHEN is also creating a variety of solutions for search,\nretrieval, and integration across the G2P information space. This work\nbuilds on, and will demonstrate the utility of, databases and software\ntools created in the project. Initial work has focused on integration and\nadvanced data provision via existing centralized resources, notably the\nEnsembl genome browser (http:\/\/www.ensembl.org). This employs\nestablished technologies such as the BioMart data integration system\nfor large-scale data querying [Smedley et al., 2009] (http:\/\/www.\nbiomart.org), and the DAS protocol for exchanging record annotations\n[Dowell et al., 2001; Jenkinson et al., 2008] (http:\/\/www.biodas.org), as\nwell as by building new Web services on top of various project\ndatabases and by the construction of data discovery platforms.\nBox 2.

Also, exemplifying the power of the\nhybrid federation\/centralization approach, GEN2PHEN has built\nHGVbaseG2P [Thorisson et al., 2008a] (http:\/\/www.hgvbaseg2p.\norg)\u2014recently rebadged as \u2018\u2018GWAS Central\u2019\u2019 (http:\/\/www.gwascentral.\norg)\u2014to provide powerful graphical and textual modes for\ncomparing and contrasting multiple datasets from published,\nunpublished, and private user-uploaded GWAS studies. Finally, as\nan illustration of how data can be openly exposed yet still shared in a\ncontrolled manner, the GEN2PHEN project offers Mendelian gene\nmutation data via the Cafe\u00b4 for Routine Genetic data Exchange (\u2018\u2018Cafe\u00b4\nRouGE\u2019\u2019: http:\/\/www.caferouge.org)\u2014an innovative \u2018\u2018clearing house\u2019\u2019\nconcept that could be easily redeployed to support the safe advertising\nof many types of data. See Box 2 for a more detailed listing.\nBeyond the above practical projects concerned with creating or\nextending mostly traditional data-centric online resources, GEN2-\nPHEN is working on cultural and policy issues, such as: ethicolegal\nconsiderations around G2P data collection and sharing; the idea of\nproviding a BioResource Impact Factor (BRIF) metric for biobanks\nand databases [Cambon-Thomsen, 2003; Kauffmann and Cambon-\nThomsen, 2008]; and designing, creating, and piloting the use of\ndigital IDs for researchers via involvement in the newly formed\nORCID initiative (http:\/\/www.orcid.org), so that a researcher\u2019s\nonline G2P activities and contributions can be discovered,\nrecognized, rewarded, and encouraged. All these different aspects\nof the GEN2PHEN work program progress in parallel, with links\nand crossfertilization opportunities being exploited wherever\npossible. But there is one overriding activity that seeks to bring\nvirtually all the other subprojects together: the G2P Knowledge\nCentre (KC), a virtual \u2018\u2018Center of Excellence\u2019\u2019 designed to provide a\nrange of new, innovative services to support G2P research.\nThe G2P Knowledge Centre\nThe overriding goal of the KC is to provide a central platform\namalgamating direct access to distributed G2P data with specialist\nHUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 32, No. 5, 543\u2013550, 2011 545\nknowledge, all encompassed within a collaborative scientific\nonline workspace (Fig. 2).\nOther scientific disciplines have already embraced this kind of\nonline collaborative data enrichment resource. For example, in the\nfield of nanotechnology, the nanoHUB facility (http:\/\/www.\nnanohub.org) provides direct access to powerful simulation tools\ncoupled with extensive community-driven features such as\ndownloadable lectures and presentations, online seminars, events\nlistings, and mechanisms for rapid publication of data and other\nresults. The nanoHUB project has been hugely successful, with its\nscope extending to some 1,600 resources involving 600 con-\ntributors, and over 100,000 users per year. Such initiatives are far\nless common in the biomedical sciences, although some notable\nsmaller scale examples do exist, such as Alzforum [Kinoshita and\nClark, 2007] (http:\/\/www.alzforum.org), which combines access to\ndata from Alzheimer\u2019s disease research, discussion forums, event\nlistings, and virtual conferences. In going beyond the remit of\nsimple data portals, such sites can help the scientific endeavor by\nbringing experts together around common problems and concrete\ndata. So far, however, no such tool has existed for the\ngenotype\u2013phenotype field in general\u2014an oversight the G2P\nKnowledge Centre seeks to address.\nAlthough not its central mission, one section of the KC serves as\nthe GEN2PHEN project Website. This gives GEN2PHEN a way to\nleverage the KC environment to disseminate information on the\nproject, to provide full and immediate access to all the project\ndeliverables\/outputs and training activities, and to furnish a\ncomprehensive listing of every GEN2PHEN-related tool, Website,\nand database (see Box 3).\nBox 3. Project Resources Available at the GEN2PHEN Section\nof the G2P Knowledge Centre\nProject deliverables. The majority of completed GEN2PHEN deliverable\ndocuments covering all 10 work packages are available to the general public to\nview or download. Many of these highly detailed reports will be of interest to\nboth G2P researchers and bioinformaticians.

GEN2PHEN\u2019s outputs are both many and diverse.\nTo emphasize the project\u2019s involvement in shaping the future of G2P data\nflows, we provide a comprehensive listing of all GEN2PHEN-supported\nactivities. This includes not only fully fledged database systems, but also links\nto software source-code and data specifications for various projects. http:\/\/\nwww.gen2phen.org\/resources\nTraining tools and materials. As part of GEN2PHEN\u2019s overarching strategy, the\nproject produces myriad training tools such as user manuals, tutorials, and\nvideos for GEN2PHEN-related tools and resources. The KC provides a central\naccess point for these tools, which can be either hosted locally or on external\nWebsites, and can be accessed via the training section at http:\/\/\nwww.gen2phen.org\/training\nThis information thereby contributes to the KC\u2019s far broader set\nof data listings and search capabilities, in turn coupled into an\ninnovative system whereby users may provide per-record annota-\ntions for remotely hosted G2P data. Finally, superimposed upon\nall of this, the KC provides an array of tools for establishing and\nnurturing active online research communities.\nFigure 1. The ultimate fully integrated network of G2P resources. This figure illustrates the \u2018\u2018pre-GEN2PHEN\u2019\u2019 status of G2P databases set\nagainst the \u2018\u2018post-GEN2PHEN\u2019\u2019 arrangement the project seeks to help create. The former comprises very few extant databases and great\ndiversity of design (the shapes filled with variously colored patterns) with essentially no interoperability connections (adjoining lines) between\nthem. This provides no convenient way to populate the databases, no easy way to exchange or compare or integrate the different resources,\nand absolutely no way to search the totality of gathered information. In contrast, the future vision entails one of a broad array of G2P databases\n(shown in dashed outlines), all constructed from common principles and standards via open-source software (hence, all uniformly\ncolored white), so enabling widespread interconnectivity in the resulting G2P Knowledge network. The ultimate unified system will naturally\nassume a hierarchical arrangement wherein \u2018\u2018basal\u2019\u2019 databases will tend to hold more detailed and diverse information (e.g., individual-level\ndata, study results from single institutions, expert manual annotations), whereas the databases above them will bring many such datasets\ntogether with a degree of simplification per record. At all levels, but particularly from the larger data \u2018\u2018warehouses\u2019\u2019 on top of each hierarchy,\ninformation will be channeled and\/or served to universal search platforms and graphical browsers, such as Ensembl (the central browser in\nGEN2PHEN) at http:\/\/www.ensembl.org. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.wiley.com\/humanmutation.]\n546 HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 32, No. 5, 543\u2013550, 2011\nThe main features of the KC will now be discussed in more\ndetail below.\nA Central Search for G2P Data\nDatabases holding G2P data are both many and diverse, ranging\nfrom per-gene locus-specific databases, to GWAS catalogs and\nG2P archives. A researcher hoping to track down G2P data for a\ngiven locus would need to visit several databases and negotiate\ndiffering user interfaces and data formats merely to see what data\nare available, let alone retrieve, integrate, and analyze those data.\nThe KC seeks to reduce this workload by providing a single access\npoint to the wealth of data stored throughout an extensive\nfederated G2P database network. The principle is simple\u2014a KC\nsearch will return a summary of available G2P data organized by\nsource database, with result entries linking back to original\nrecords. Relevant records within the aforementioned Cafe\u00b4 RouGE\nwill also be made available via this central search tool.\nThis holistic searching is carried out \u2018\u2018live\u2019\u2019\u2014that is, searches do not\nserve up old results from an internal database updated periodically by\nscanning client databases; instead, the system interrogates the many\nsource databases directly, in real time. Therefore, data are always up to\ndate (within a few hours), subject to caching mechanisms put in place\nboth to prevent overloading client databases and to still provide results\nin the event of a source database being inaccessible.\nCrucially, in addition to the broad search capability, the KC aims\nto go yet further by providing a novel annotation system, whereby\nusers can directly comment on and flag search results from remote\ndatabases. The idea here is that these user-supplied annotations will\nbe made available both to database maintainers and to the wider G2P\ncommunity, both on the KC Website and in machine-readable form\nvia an application programming interface (API), thus providing a\ncommunity-edited annotation layer for distributed G2P data. This\ninnovative new system, inspired by recent wiki-like community\nannotation projects like WikiProteins [Mons et al., 2008] (http:\/\/\nwww.wikiproteins.org) and the RNA WikiProject [Daub et al., 2008]\n(http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:WikiProject_RNA), allows\nannotations to be anchored to specific database records or resources,\nperhaps sparking further community-based debate and discussion. In\nthis way, G2P database content is taken beyond the realm of static\ndatabase records so that they become \u2018\u2018living\u2019\u2019 entities, enhanced and\nevolved by user and producer comments.\nA Catalog of Locus-Specific Databases\nAs a particular service to researchers and clinicians interested in\ninherited disease risk, the KC provides a comprehensive listing of\nLSDBs, which is further enriched by incorporating extensive\nmetadata from a recent survey into this field [Mitropoulou et al.,\n2010]. Collaborations are being sought to continually update this\nlist from various sources, by both manual and automated means.\nIn addition to a fast, searchable Web interface, these data are\nsupplied in numerous formats including comma separated value\n(CSV) text, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, Atom feeds, and JSON\/\nJSONP. Such formats allow use of these data by individual end-\nusers, or incorporation into third-party Websites and tools. To\nenable this latter option, a simple JavaScript copy-and-paste\nplugin is provided that allows Website maintainers to insert the\nLSDB listing, complete with sorting, paging, and filtering\nfunctionality, into their own pages. The plugin can be fully styled\nvia CSS to suit the hosting Website. Further information is\navailable online (http:\/\/www.gen2phen.org\/data\/lsdbs).\nThe LSDB catalog provides a perfect example of the KC\u2019s\nphilosophy of providing content not only through human-readable\nFigure 2. Homepage of the G2P Knowledge Centre. Via this Web page users are presented with a list of most recent content, latest news, full\nevents listings, lists of interest groups, and access to bookmarked content. A gene search box is also provided. Tabbed menus lead to main site\nsections, namely, news, events, community, data and about GEN2PHEN. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at\nwww.wiley.com\/humanmutation.]\nHUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 32, No. 5, 543\u2013550, 2011 547\nWeb pages, but also via alternative machine-readable formats,\nallowing greater integration with other tools and resources. This\nprovision will be expanded upon and enhanced with future\nincremental KC updates.\nNews, Blogs, and Event Listings\nThe KC provides a broad-scope information portal for the G2P\ncommunity, encompassing not just data and analytical resources,\nbut also useful day-to-day features such as news items, events\nlistings, and blog posts. For the news section, abstracts and short\nsummaries are gathered from relevant journals and other online\nresources and manually selected for particular relevance. Each\nabstract or article is linked to the original full article on the source\nWebsite. Visitors to the KC can post comments on articles, and\nread comments posted by others. Additionally, visitors can utilize\nthe site-wide bookmarking system to track updates, alterations,\nand comments on these items, providing a personalized listing of\ninteresting content via simple Web interfaces and an RSS feed. In\nparticular, the specialist editorial selection of articles is likely to be\nof high interest to scientists working on genotype-to-phenotype\nrelationships and allied fields. As with most KC content, the regular\nnews digest is available not only through the Web interface, but\nalso RSS feeds. Finally, users are strongly encouraged to contribute\nnews articles that they find interesting, either by submitting full\nstories or simply by suggesting useful links. These articles or useful\nlinks will then be published at an editor\u2019s discretion.\nComplementing the KC\u2019s aggregated news provision, a number\nof contributor blogs are provided for the dispensation of timely\nopinion pieces and short rapidly disseminated articles, often of a\nless formal nature than the aforementioned news articles. These\nare intended to quickly highlight both scientific and technological\ndevelopments and provoke healthy debate by the G2P community.\nAgain, blog posts can be obtained via blog-specific and site-wide\nRSS feeds, and these can be monitored via the site\u2019s intuitive\nbookmarking system. Enquiries from users interested in running\ntheir own blog on the KC are welcomed.\nThe KC also features listings of upcoming G2P-related events\nthat may be of interest to its users, including conferences,\nsymposia, and training events. The community can also use the\nfacility to advertise their own events to others in the G2P field via\na simple submission form. Events are displayed in a simple listing,\nan interactive calendar and on a map.\nIn general, users can comment upon, and sometimes update,\nalmost any item within the KC. This reflects one of the site\u2019s\nprincipal goals, that content is not simply posted to be viewed or\nremain stagnant, but instead it should be allowed to, and\nencouraged to, evolve so that it drives community debate and\nhence advances science in the G2P domain.\nInterest Groups\nThe \u2018\u2018Interest Groups\u2019\u2019 section of the KC provides self-contained\nareas of the site (\u2018\u2018mini-KCs\u2019\u2019) dedicated to particular fields or\nprojects in a manner similar to commonplace Internet forums.\nUnlike regular forums, however, where users are typically restricted\nto simple thread-based text messages, users may contribute\ndocuments (which will be then be viewable within the Web\nbrowser, or downloadable), regular posts, create wiki pages (which\nmay be edited by other group members thus easing the production\nof collaborative documents), news articles, and events, as part of\nthe content in these groups (Fig. 3). These features provide a\nflexible and powerful workspace for collaborative groups, and\nhence are used both within the GEN2PHEN project and by the\nwider G2P community. Each group is maintained by a dedicated\ngroup administrator, whose job it is to manage group posts and\nFigure 3. An example of an Interest Group. Each group operates like a small self-contained Knowledge Centre and can contain posts, wiki\npages, documents, events, news, and blogs. Membership for each group can be open to the public or restricted to private workgroups. [Color\nfigure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.wiley.com\/humanmutation.]\n548 HUMAN MUTATION, Vol. 32, No. 5, 543\u2013550, 2011\nmemberships. Posts within groups may be restricted to the group,\nor made visible to all users of the site.\nInterest groups further allow collaborative workspaces to be\ntightly coupled to the resources available and accessible from the\nKC. Active interest groups as of January 2011 (see http:\/\/\nwww.gen2phen.org\/community) cover the following topics:\n* Bio-Resource Impact Factor (BRIF).\n* Locus Reference Genomic standard (LRG).\n* Phenotype data modeling.\n* Researcher identification.\n* Utilizing the semantic Web.\n* Web services and exchange formats.\nMost of these groups are available to the general public, whereas\na few require users to receive authorization from a group\nadministrator to participate. The KC welcomes and encourages\napplications from members of the G2P community who wish to\nutilize the interest group facilities for their own topics and\nprojects. Such proposals can be made via a simple request form\navailable at the site.\nSystem Design and Implementation\nThe KC has been constructed using the Drupal content\nmanagement system (CMS) (http:\/\/www.drupal.org). Despite a\nsteeper development learning curve compared to other popular\nCMSs, Drupal was selected for its robust and extremely flexible\ncode base with which to build sophisticated Web applications. The\nstandard platform has since been considerably extended using a\ncombination of both public domain contributed modules and\nseveral custom coded modules specific to the KC implementation.\nAs with other GEN2PHEN software packages, these extensions\nwill be made available for download as open-source software.\nFuture Directions\nAs summarized in this article, even though only two-thirds of\nthe way through its funding period, the GEN2PHEN project has\nalready generated many key resources and paved the way to a fully\nintegrated, community-enhanced G2P network. In its current\nform, the KC provides the G2P community with a central hub for\ndata, other useful information, and community interaction. To\nfurther leverage these powerful tools and resources, the project\ngenerally (and the KC in particular) will continue to explore new\nmethods to distribute its contents besides the human-readable\nHTML-based Website. Besides commonly used formats for Web\ncontent syndication such as RSS and Atom, technologies and\nformats such as the resource description framework (RDF) may be\nemployed to provide data and leverage the potentially immense\npower of the Semantic Web [Berners-Lee and Hendler, 2001;\nBerners-Lee et al., 2001]\u2014a self-describing Web-based global\nnetwork of linked data (http:\/\/linkeddata.org). An associated\nexpansion of Web services both on the KC and as part of other\nproject resources will simultaneously help to facilitate Web-based\ndata integration or \u2018\u2018mash-ups\u2019\u2019 [Cheung et al., 2008], and\nmachine-oriented knowledge generation.\nMost ambitiously of all, the GEN2PHEN project has recently\nbegun exploring how G2P data and related tools might be adapted\nor newly created to move G2P knowledge beyond the research\ndomain and into the healthcare environment. Clearly, this raises\nmany challenges that are far too large and way beyond the scope of\nGEN2PHEN itself. But the very successful philosophy the project\nhas followed, with its emphasis upon integrated community\ndevelopment work toward fully interoperable information net-\nworks and the bidirectional flow of information to\/from the user\ncommunity, probably represents a good template for future\nprojects seeking to integrate G2P and other bioscience realms,\nespecially if aiming at delivering improved healthcare.\nIn summary, even though we argue that GEN2PHEN has made\na good start in a range of directions, we are fully aware that a\nmassive amount of further work needs to be done if scientists are\nto fully meet the challenge set out at the start of this article: that is,\nto effectively organize, integrate, share, and interpret the wealth of\nnew life science information in sophisticated and effective ways.\nWe believe this challenge can and will be met, and foresee many\nexciting and revolutionary years ahead as this is achieved.\nReferences\nBerners-Lee T, Hendler J. 2001.
