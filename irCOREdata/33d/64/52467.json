The Gangdong Oilfield is considered to have a small potential \nstorage capacity (23 Mt) and to be possibly suitable for an EOR or small scale storage \npilot rather than large-scale storage. The Shengli oilfield province is considered to \nhave a great potential storage capacity (472 Mt in eight selected fields), however, \nthese fields, like those of the Gangdong oilfield province, are compartmentalised by \nfaulting and stratigraphy and likely to be quite challenging for injection. Unmineable \ncoalseams in the Kailuan mining area were also considered for storage, the estimated \ncapacity is 504 Gt adsorbed onto the coal and 38100 Mt void storage capacity. \nHowever, the coals have low porosity and permeability, so they would be expected to \nhave poor injectivity. This is also an active mining area and so any storage site would \nhave to be chosen carefully to avoid affecting future energy resources. The Huimin \nsub-basin within the Jiyang Depression was identified for consideration as an aquifer \nstorage site; the Guantao Formation has good porosity and permeability in this region, \nand the regional-level storage capacity of these areas was estimated to be 0.7 Gt. The \naquifers in the Huimin-sub basin appear promising for storage, however, less data are \navailable than for the oilfields and the sealing formations are not directly proven to \ntrap buoyant fluids, though in adjacent oilfield in the Shengli oilfield province, the \nMinghuazhen Formation forms a regional seal for the Guantao Formation.  \n \nKeywords: CO2 storage; Bohai Basin; COACH; Dagang; Shengli; Kailuan; Jiyang  \n \nIntroduction \nThe Cooperation Action within Carbon Capture and Storage China\u2013EU project \n(COACH) is a three-year EC Framework 6 co-funded collaborative project. Storage \npotential of selected sites in the Bohai Basin (north-east China) has been evaluated by \nChinese scientists using published data with support from EU partners. Most \nindustrial development and therefore the majority of large sources of carbon dioxide \n(CO2), lie along the eastern coastline and consequently storage sites are being sought \nin this area. The storage sites considered were the Dagang oilfield province (Tianjin \nMunicipality), Shengli oilfield province (Shandong Province), Kailuan mining area \n(Hebei Province) and deep saline aquifers in the Jiyang Depression (Shandong \nprovince) (Figure 1).  \n \nMethodology \nA regional level assessment of selected potential storage sites for CO2 in the Bohai \nBasin was carried out for the COACH project. The storage capacity was estimated in \neach case using a simplified version of the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum \n(CSLF) methodology (Bachu et al., 2007). The storage reservoir properties, sealing \nformation properties, reservoir injectivity and other relevant parameters were also \nconsidered. For all sites considered, publicly available data were used. PetroChina \nalso provided data for the Dagang oilfield province and the China University of \nMining and Technology carried out experiments on coal samples to improve the \naccuracy of the storage assessment.  \n \nThe storage capacity of the oilfields was estimated using the following equation: \nMCO2e = (URRstp .Bo) . \u03c1CO2 . Scoeff       [1] \n \nWhere  \nMCO2e = estimated effective storage capacity (Mt) \nURRstp = Ultimately Recoverable Reserves (at standard temperature and pressure) \n(Mt converted to m3 using API of oil) \nBo = Formation volume factor (Assumed to be 1.1 due to lack of data) \n\u03c1CO2 = Density of CO2 in the reservoir (650 kg\/m3 Poulsen et al., 2009) \nScoeff = storage coefficient to discount for water invasion etc (0.3) \n \nThe storage capacity of the Shengli oilfield province was also estimated by the China \nUniversity of Beijing (CUPB) using a methodology based on Tanaka et al, (1995) \nwhich assumes that CO2 will displace pore fluids and rapidly dissolve into the pore \nfluids:  \n \nMCO2 = M1+M2+M3         [2] \n \nWhere  \nMCO2 = estimated  storage capacity of CO2 summed for all reservoirs in the oilfield \n(m3). This was converted to tonnes assuming CO2 density of 650 kg\/m3. \nM1 is the storage capacity of CO2 dissolved in oil and water in the oil bearing \nreservoir \nM2 = storage capacity of CO2 dissolved in the water-bearing formation in contact with \nthe oilfield \nM3 = storage capacity of CO2 replacing oil in the oil bearing reservoir during CO2 \nflooding \n \nSubstituting these into equation [2] gives \n \nMCO2 = Ef\u00d7Ao\u00d7ho\u00d7\u03c6\u00d7[So\u00d7Ro(CO2) + (1 - So)\u00d7Rw(CO2)] + ho\u00d7Ao\u00d7\u03c6\u00d7Sw + (Mp\u00d74%\/\u03c1f) [3] \n \nWhere \nEf  = overall sweep efficiency (fraction), Ef = 5%-25% \nAo = area of oil-bearing reservoir (m2) \nho = thickness of reservoir (m) \n\u03c6 = porosity of reservoir (fraction) \nSo = oil saturation in reservoir (fraction) \nRo (CO2) = CO2 solubility in oil (fraction) \nRw(CO2) = CO2 solubility in water(fraction) \nSw = CO2 solubility in formation water (fraction) \nMp = residual oil in reservoir (104t) (from published data for 2000) \n\u03c1f = oil density in formation (kg\/m3) \n \nSweep efficiency, Ef varies between 5% and 25% based on typical reservoir \nproperties. In the Shengli oilfield province, it was assumed to be 12%. When T=45 \u00baC, \nP=12.7 MPa, Rw(CO2)=5%(mass) and Ro(CO2)=15% (weight percentage) and the \nformation water had salinity over 10000 mg\/L, Rw(CO2) was assumed to be 4.2% \n(0.07m3\/m3), otherwise a value of 5% (0.083m3\/m3) was used for Rw(CO2). Ro(CO2) is \n(0.160 m3\/m3). It was assumed that CO2 solubility in the formation water (Sw) was the \nsame as Rw(CO2). Average oil recovery ratio by CO2 flooding in a pilot test was 4%. \n \nUsing a CSLF-based methodology (Bachu et al 2007), the storage potential of \nunmineable coal seams was calculated using the following equation:  \n \nMCO2e = \u03c1CO2s\u00d7Ac\u00d7hc\u00d7nc\u00d7 [VL\u00d7P\/(P+PL)] \u00d7(1-fa-fm) \u00d7ER \u00d7C\u00d7 Rf   [4]\n             \n \nWhere MCO2e = estimated effective CO2 storage capacity (kg) \n\u03c1CO2s = density of CO2 at the standard temperature and pressure (1.873 kg\/m3) \nAc = area of the coal zone \nhc = effective thickness of the coal zone \nnc = the bulk coal density (generally nc \u22481.4 t\/m3) \nfa = ash weight fraction of the coal  \nfm = moisture weight fraction of the coal \nVL = Langmuir volume constant (SCF\/tonne) \nPL = Langmuir Pressure constant (psia) \nER = ratio of CO2 adsorbed to methane desorbed \nRf = recovery factor (fraction of gas that can be produced from the coal seam) \nC = completion factor (estimate of the cumulative coal thickness that will contribute \nto gas production or storage) \n \nStorage capacity was estimated using a simplified version of the CSLF method for \naquifers (Bachu et al., 2007): \nMCO2e = Aa ha \u03c6 \u03c1CO2r Scoeff        [5] \nWhere  \nMCO2e = effective estimated storage capacity (tonnes) \nAa = area of the aquifer (m2) \nha = height of the aquifer (m) multiplied by the net:gross ratio (the ratio of thickness \nof sandstone in the aquifer to overall aquifer height) \n\u03c6 = average porosity of the aquifer (%) \n\u03c1CO2r = density of CO2 at reservoir conditions (650 kg\/m3) \nScoeff = storage coefficient (Set as 2% based for this regional estimate based on results \nfrom the GeoCapacity Project, Vangkilde-Pederson et al., 2008, Bachu 2008) \n \nDagang oilfield province \nThe Dagang oilfield province lies in the Huanghua Depression of the Bohai Basin. \nExploration began in 1955; numerous wells have been drilled and water flooding is \nused to maintain reservoir pressure during production. Storage potential for the \nDagang oilfield province was assessed using publicly available information and data \nprovided by the Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development \n(PetroChina) (RIPED). The main oil and gas reservoir formations are the Neogene \nDongying, Guantao and Minghuazhen formations (Figure 2). Initially, the storage \ncapacity for seven selected reservoirs was estimated using the simplified version of \nthe CSLF methodology described above (equation 1). Applying this to the seven \nselected reservoirs in the Gangzhong, Shenshvi, Gangdong, Gangxi and Wangguantun \nfields, gives an estimated storage capacity of 22 MtCO2. This estimated storage \ncapacity used data on the oilfield provided by RIPED, with the exception of the Bo \nwhich was obtained from published data. The uncertainty in the field data is low, \nhowever, as the storage coefficient is based on published data from reservoir models \nfrom geologically simpler oilfields, the field would need to be studied in more detail \nand reservoir simulations would be required to improve confidence in this estimate. \n \nThe Gangdong Oilfield was believed to have the largest capacity and so was selected \nby RIPED for more detailed study. The oilfield lies in the Beidagang Structural Belt, a \nregion characterised by multi-phase intensive faulting, variable lithology and \nlithofacies, overlapping formations and many unconformity surfaces. The north \nmargin of the Gangdong Oilfield is marked by the Gangdong Fault which was active \nduring the Tertiary Period. The hydrocarbon bearing interval reaches a thickness of up \nto 1000 m, and oil is buried at depths of 1000 m to 2000 m. The main hydrocarbon-\nbearing formations in this field are the Guantao and Minghuazhen formations. Each of \nthese formations comprises numerous thin and often isolated sand bodies and lenses \nof 2 \u2013 10 m thickness, surrounded by mudstone. Over 600 wells have been drilled to \nexploit this resource. The reservoirs of the Guantao Formation are usually oil-bearing \nwith lesser amounts of associated gas and the reservoirs of the Minghuazhen \nFormation are mainly gas-bearing. Ultimately recoverable reserves were estimated at \nalmost 90 Mt oil. \nThe Guantao Formation comprises cream sandstone \u2013 siltstone and grey mudstone, \nbelieved to have been deposited in a braided river system. Sandstones of the Guantao \nFormation have average porosities and permeabilities of 31% and 975 mD \nrespectively. These reservoirs are sealed by mudstones of the lower Minghuazhen \nFormation, which form a regional seal or mudstones within the Guantao Formation. \nThe Minghuazhen Formation comprises red \u2013 green continental clastic sediments \ndeposited in oxidizing conditions. The sedimentary sequence clearly shows a fining-\nupward point bar sequence, from conglomerate to mudstone, believed to have been \ndeposited in a meandering river system. These reservoirs are sealed by younger \nMinghuazhen Formation claystones.  \nUsing the simplified methodology described above storage capacity of the Gangdong \nOilfield was estimated to be 8 MtCO2. Despite good porosities and permeabilities \nwithin the sandstone bodies, injectivity of these sandstones is expected to be poor as \nthe fields comprise many small reservoirs, which are compartmentalised by faulting \nand stratigraphy. Overall, the Gangdong field is not suitable for large-scale storage of \nCO2, however, a small pilot for CO2- EOR could be considered, though careful \nconsideration into potential leakage pathways through boreholes and faults would be \nneeded. Wells in which resistant cements have not been used may be vulnerable to \ncorrosion of cement by carbonic acid formed when CO2 mixes with water \u2013 this is a \nconsideration for any storage site. As there are numerous wells drilled in the Dagang \nOilfield province, potential corrosion of wellbores needs to be given serious \nconsideration as wells in operation and completed wells have not been constructed \nwith exposure to CO2 in mind. \nShengli oilfield province \nThe Shengli oilfield province lies in the Jiyang Depression in the northern Shandong \nProvince near the mouth of the Yellow River. Published data for 2000 indicates the \nShengli Oilfield includes about 65 oilfields and two gasfields covering an aerial extent \nof about 2117 km2. The majority of oil reserves (90%) lie at depths between 950 and \n3200 m. The oilfields selected for storage potential assessment were the Shengtuo, \nDonxin, Xianhezhuang, Caoqiao, Bamianhe, Binnan, Shanjiasi and Gudao. The main \nreservoir formations in these oilfields lie within sandstone bodies within the Shahejie \nand Guantao formations. The Shahejie Formation comprises dark grey mudstone and \ncream sandstone interbedded with yellow-brown siltstone. The Guantao Formation \ncomprises grey pebbly sandstone intercalated with grey \u2013 green mudstones. Both \nthese formations are fluvial in origin. The Guantao Formation reservoirs are sealed by \nintra-formation mudstones or the regional seal of the Minghuazhen Formation. \nReservoirs in the Shahejie Formation are sealed by mudstones within the formation or \nthe overlying Dongying Formation. The sandstones of the Guantao Formation in the \nGudao oilfield are also of similar reservoir quality with average porosity 33% (range \n28-35%) and permeability average 3118 mD (range 510-3,100 mD) (C&C reservoirs \n1998). \n \nThe properties of crude oil in the Shengli oilfield province are highly variable; the \nrelative densities of crude oils range from 0.7604 to 1.0866 g\/cm3, viscosity of the oils \nvaries from 4.44 \u2013 84576 mPa.s. The sulphur content of the crude oils ranges from 0 \nto 13.9 % and the pour point of the oils is -34 to 55\u00b0C. The proportion of crude oil \nwith higher relative density and higher viscosity increases gradually through the strata \nfrom older to younger rocks. During enhanced oil recovery, in particular with CO2-\nEOR, deposition of asphaltene and paraffins can be a problem, so oils with low \nquantities of these impurities and a high pour point (ability to hold asphaltene and \nparaffin in solution to avoid scaling issues) are preferred (Donaldson et al., 1989).  \nAbout 55% of the formation water in the Shengli Oilfield Province is CaCl2 and Cl-\nNa rich. Salinity of the formation water ranges from 20000 to 60000 mg\/L.  \n \nThe same simplified CSLF-based methodology described for the Dagang field was \napplied to evaluate storage potential of the Shengli oilfields. The storage potential of \nselected fields in the Shengli oilfield province complex was estimated to be 472 Mt \nusing the CSLF-based methodology (equation 1), the largest capacity being in the \nShengtuo Oilfield at 186 Mt. The China University of Petroleum (Beijing) used an \nalternative method of calculating storage capacity, based on Tanaka et al., 1995, \nwhich estimated the storage capacity of the Shengli oilfields to be 463 Mt using \nequation 3. The Shengtuo Oilfield again had the largest estimated storage capacity of \n108 Mt (assuming CO2 density 650 kg\/m3).  \n \n \n \nBoth these storage estimates are based on published data from 2000 \u2013 the most \nrecently published oilfield data (remaining reserves, reservoir thickness and area, oil \nproperties). As a result, there is quite high uncertainty in these estimates. This \nemphasises the importance of cooperation with oil companies and other stakeholders \nin China; as SINOPEC were not a partner of the COACH project, this part of the \nassessment was purely dependent on published data.  \n \nEnhanced oil recovery and security of energy supply are key considerations for China. \nThe potential for enhanced oil recovery was also estimated by CUPB. The Shengli \noilfield province storage potential was also evaluated using a method applied by the \nChina University of Petroleum Beijing (CUPB) based on displacement of pore water \nand dissolution of CO2 into porewater and oil; CO2 can assist recovery by dissolving \ninto the oil reducing viscosity or by pushing oil towards the production boreholes. The \nadditional oil which could be recovered by EOR was calculated to be approximately \n23 \u2013 112 Mt using yield rates of 2 \u2013 10%.  \n \nThe Shengli oilfield province has larger estimated capacities than the Dagang oilfield \nprovince, the reservoirs are however also compartmentalised by faulting and \nstratigraphy which is expected to cause poor injectivity for CO2. There are also \nnumerous boreholes which could offer potential route for CO2 to the surface if not \nproperly completed. The field could be considered for small scale storage, however, a \nmore detailed investigation would be required to improve confidence, this would \nrequire access to detailed data such as seismic which is not available in the public \ndomain.  \n \nKailuan mining area \nKailuan mining area lies in the north Bohai Basin and includes the Kaiping and Jiyu \ncoalfields. The Kailuan Mining Area lies within a high seismicity risk region, which \nneeds to be taken into consideration in terms of security of storage; investigation \nwould be needed to determine if movement along faults potentially compromise the \nseal and permit any free CO2 to escape into the overlying strata and to the surface. \nThe mining area contains an estimated 3750 Mt coal reserves of Carboniferous and \nPermian age which lie within the Shihezi, Shanxi, Taiyuan and Benxi formations \n(Figure 3). The thickness of Carboniferous-Permian strata is 490 m to 530 m, which \nincludes 15 to 20 coal beds with cumulative thickness of 20 m to 28 m. The area in \nwhich coalbed methane (CBM) is exploited covers 900 km2 and uses coalseams at \ndepths of up to 2000m in the Kailuan mining area. Total estimated CBM reserves are \nover 70 billion m3. Pore fluid flow in aquifers between the coalseams is 0.1 \u2013 0.7 \nL\/s.m.  \n \nThe coals are low rank with a moderate degree of coal metamorphism. The coal is \nmainly gas coal, fat coal and coking coal. Porosity of the coal seams in the Shanxi \nFormation is 0.5%, and permeability is 3.5 mD. The Langmuir volume is 32.76 m3\/t \nand the Langmuir pressure is 3.0 MPa. The roof and soleplate of the coal bed is \ncompact sandstone and mud stone, which is an effective trap for CBM. \n \nCarbon dioxide injected into coal is preferentially adsorbed on to the coal, displacing \ncoalbed methane, and potentially providing an additional energy resource (enhanced \ncoalbed methane or ECBM recovery). As Kailuan is an active coal-mine, ECBM \ncould only be applied at sites where there was no risk of contamination of resources \nor leakage through contact with future, active or abandoned coal mines. Site screening \ndetermined that uneconomic seams are present at suitable depth for CO2 storage. \nPermeability is a determining factor in the viability of a CO2 storage site, and \ncurrently it is considered that coal permeability has to be greater than 1 mD for \nsuccessful CO2 injection and\/or coalbed methane (CBM) production. Coal swells as \nCO2 is adsorbed, which further reduces permeability and injectivity (Benson et al., \n2005). Coal swelling generally increases with increasing gas affinity to coal (e.g., CO2 \nversus methane) and may reduce permeability by two orders of magnitude or more \n(Shi and Durucan 2005, Cui et al., 2007).  \n \nIn the Kaiping Coalfield, in the east of the Kailuan mining area, the ash content of the \ncoals varies from less than 15% to more than 25% and most the seams are low sulphur \ncoals. Porosity and permeability were generally low in the Kaiping coalfield with the \nmost favourable properties found in samples from the Tangshan coalmine for the \nEarly Permian Taiyuan Formation coal with porosity 3.7% and permeability 3.6 mD. \nCoals in the Jiyu Coalfield in the west of the Kailuan mining area have been affected \nby igneous intrusion and volcanic activity and the ash content is generally high. \n \nExperiments were carried out by the China University of Mining and Technology on \ncoals from Majiagou Mine (MK-9) and Linnancang Mine (LNC-11), taken from the \nKaiping and Jiyu coalfields respectively. Comparison of three different theoretical \nmethods for estimating adsorption demonstrated the importance of experimental \nresults for calculating absorption properties and thereby for estimating CO2 storage \ncapacity. Samples were subjected to isothermal adsorption experiments and proximate \nanalysis (moisture, ash and volatile matter, sulphur content and vitrinite reflectance \nwere determined).  The maceral compositions were determined to be favourable for \nCO2 adsorption. Overall the adsorption capacity of the medium rank MK-9 sample \nwas higher than that of the low rank LNC-11 sample.  \n \nUsing the simplified CSLF methodology (equation 4), the capacity of the Kailuan \nmining area was estimated to be 504 Gt. In addition to the amount of CO2 that could \nbe adsorbed onto the coal, the amount of CO2 that could potentially be stored in \nexhausted coalmines (the void storage capacity) was estimated to be 38100 Mt for the \nKailuan mining area. Although the storage capacities are estimated to be large, the \ncoals have low permeability (up to 3.6 mD) and porosity (average 3.5%), so \ninjectivity is expected to be low and as this is an active mining area, any storage site \nwould have to be chosen with care to avoid affecting future energy resources and \nmining activities. The uncertainty in the storage capacity estimates is high as these \nadsorbtion tests were carried out on powdered coal samples, obtaining the maximum \ntheoretical adsorption capacity. In the underground coal seams, storage capacity will \nactually be strongly limited by the generally low permeability of these coals.  \nThe coals are well sealed by overlying mudstones, which could potentially trap CO2. \nHowever, these potential caprocks are penetrated by faults, CBM boreholes and coal \nmines which could provide potential leakage pathways to the surface.  \n \nJiyang Depression \nThe oil-bearing Jiyang Depression lies in the central Bohai Basin. It covers an area of \naround 20000 km2 and is subdivided into six sag basins. The Institute of Geology and \nGeophysics (Chinese Academy of Sciences) evaluated the potential for storage in this \nregion. Through initial site screening, the Neogene aquifers and in particular the \nGuantao Formation were determined to show the most promise; they lie at suitable \ndepth (greater than 1000 m), have a broad areal distribution and good connectivity \nbetween fault blocks. After further site screening, the Huimin sub-basin in the east of \nthe Jiyang Depression was selected for further study as it has limited oil exploitation \nto conflict with potential storage activities. \n \nThe Guantao Group comprises partially cemented and fractured gravel rocks overlain \nby thick mudstones of the Lower Minghuazhen Formation. The sediments of the \nGuantao Formation are widely distributed across the Jiyang Depression, with great \nthickness, good connectivity and saline formation water. The lower part of the \nMinghuazhen Formation comprises mudstones and forms a potential regional seal, \nwhile the upper parts of the formation comprises a set of sandstones and mudstones of \nfluvial facies containing the fresh ground water resource in the area. The Guantao \nFormation comprises a 300 - 900 m thick unit of conglomeratic sandstone and \nsandstone with mudstone intercalations. The depth of the formation is more than 1000 \nm and it is overlain by 800 - 900 m of the Minghuazhen Formation comprising \nmudstone with siltstone intercalation.  \n \nBorehole information indicates groundwater flow from the margins towards the centre \nof the depression with stable pore-water chemistry. The hydrochemistry of the \naquifers mainly consists of CaCl2 (calcium carbonate) rich water. Sodium bicarbonate \n(NaHCO3) rich water only occurs on the north and south margins of the Jiyang \nDepression. The average total dissolved solid (TDS) is 10-20 g\/L. The ratio of Na\/Cl \nin most areas is less than 1 g\/L. The hydrochemical characteristics indicate that the \ngroundwater flows from the margin to the centre of the depression. In general, the \nsolubility of CO2 in formation water decreases with the increasing salinity of the \nformation water due to increased water viscosity and decreased water compressibility \nand slower chemical reaction between the pore water and CO2 (Obdam et al., 2003). \nThe Linfanjia and Shanghe oilfields in the Huimin sub- basin have average porosities \nof 31% and 19 % respectively and measured permeabilities of 390 mD and 11 \u2013 150 \nmD.  \n \nThere is more uncertainty in estimation of aquifer storage potential as a result of \nlimited data availability due to general lack of commercial interest in deep saline \naquifers. Storage capacity for the Huimin sub-basin was estimated to be 23 Gt in the \nHuimin sub-basin using equation 5. Areas where the sandstone is thickest were also \nidentified as potential targets for further study; the capacity of these areas within the \nsub-basin was estimated to be 0.7 Gt. The storage assessment for the Huimin sub-\nbasin strongly suggests there are areas worth further investigation. However, the \nstorage estimates and assessment need further study with more detailed data to \nimprove accuracy of the assessment and to identify closed structures as targets for \nstorage.  \n \nSummary \nBased on storage site potentials evaluated by the COACH partners, it is considered \nthat the Dagang oilfield province is not suitable for large-scale storage, though could \nbe considered for EOR pilots. The Shengli oilfield province was considered more \npromising for storage. Storage potential in the Kailuan mining area is low due to the \nlow permeability and the risk affecting future energy resources. There may some \npotential for enhanced coalbed methane recovery though care would have to be taken \nnot to contaminate future energy resources and to avoid risk of leakage. On initial \nevaluation, the Guantao Formation in the Jiyang Depression has a large potential \nstorage capacity, though this should be considered with caution as it does not have the \nbenefit of proven ability to store buoyant fluids and less data are available for detailed \nevaluation of the potential for storage.   \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to thank and Beibei Zhang and John Williams for their contribution \nto this paper.
