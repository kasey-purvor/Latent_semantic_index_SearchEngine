Yet what reads like a prosaic \ndomestic scene is, on closer inspection, itself a reconstruction, a paper model \nwhose minute imperfections \u2014 an exposed edge, a visible pencil mark \u2014 draw \nattention to the very mechanisms of its making.1 Thomas Demand\u2019s Kitchen \nderives from a news photograph of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein\u2019s hidea-\nway near his hometown of Tikrit, where he was forced to take refuge during the \nAmerican invasion in 2003.

Clark, \u201cthrough a terrible moment in the politics of imagining, envisioning, \nvisualizing,\u201d a moment increasingly characterized by the dismantling, in Clark\u2019s \nwords, \u201cof so many forms of resistance to the image \u2014 so many of the forms of \nlife in which the image-life of power could once be derided or spoken back to.\u201d4 \nDemand\u2019s unique working method would seem, in this respect, to \u201cspeak back\u201d \nand resist the very terms of a revivified, emboldened alignment of \u201cspectacle\u201d \nand \u201cviolence\u201d and its particular configuration of aesthetics and politics. Kitchen \nis, we would argue, completely at odds with terror\u2019s scopic regime, whether it is \nthe spectacular collapse of the World Trade Center on 9\/11, the grainy videos of \nkidnapped hostages in Iraq, the photographs of tortured prisoners at Abu Ghraib, \nor the MTV-inspired videos made by American soldiers on YouTube.\nRevisiting the relationship among violence, capital accumulation, and image \ncontrol is a central aim of RETORT\u2019s Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle \nin a New Age of War. Described as \u201cvenomous and poetic\u201d by Michael Hardt \nand as \u201cpart analysis, part manifesto\u201d by Noam Chomsky, the book is a polemic \nthat combines key Marxist concepts (e.g., primitive accumulation) with notions \nof spectacle and violence.5 RETORT is a collective, based for the past two dec-\nades in the San Francisco Bay Area, comprising Iain Boal, T. J. Clark, Joseph \nMatthews, and Michael Watts. In Afflicted Powers RETORT draws on the work \nof Guy Debord and the Situationist International to argue that \u201cthe present con-\ndition of politics does not make sense unless it is approached from a dual per-\nspective \u2014 seen as a crude struggle for material dominance, but also (threaded \never closer into that struggle) as a battle to control appearances.\u201d6 In charting the \nmaterial and spectacular rationalities of U.S. foreign policy, RETORT suggests \nthat Debord\u2019s twinned notions of \u201cthe colonization of everyday life\u201d and \u201cthe \nsociety of the spectacle\u201d need to be urgently recast in terms that do full justice to \ntheir original intent. RETORT\u2019s purpose is to \u201cmake them instruments of political \nanalysis again, directed to an understanding of the powers and vulnerabilities of \n\u201cVanishing Points: Law, Violence, and Exception in the Global War Prison,\u201d in Violent Geogra-\nphies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence, ed.

Cited throughout this dossier as AP.\nPublic Culture\n5 34\nthe capitalist state\u201d (AP, 17). Where Debord\u2019s analysis was often world-historical \nin its totalizing remit, RETORT counters with a more contingent and matter-of-\nfact version of the spectacle (AP, 19). In the collective\u2019s own words: \u201cWe wanted \nto find ways of taking spectacle seriously as a term of political explanation with-\nout turning it into the key to all mysteries. In a word, the concept needed to \nbe desacralized. It needed to be applied, locally and conjuncturally \u2014 to dirty \nits hands with the details of politics.\u201d7 We believe that such a realignment of \nthe material and the visual necessitates engagement and response. The following \ncommentaries emerge from a panel discussion examining Afflicted Powers at the \n2006 Association of American Geographers conference in Chicago. These essays \nprovide a challenging set of observations concerning RETORT\u2019s analysis of the \ncontemporary geopolitical moment, in particular its theorization of the spectacle, \nthe nature of U.S. imperialism, and the politics of modernity.\nAfflicted Powers identifies a world torn by atavism and newfangledness. It is \nunapologetic in its totalization, written in a long tradition of pamphleteering, and \nattempts to map the coordinates of a familiar yet new \u201cmilitary neoliberalism.\u201d \nOpening with an account of the U.S. state\u2019s \u201cspectacular defeat\u201d on September \n11, 2001, RETORT illustrates the complex entanglement of materiality with the \nproduction of images in the recent political and military maneuvers of the Bush \nadministration. In examining the current geopolitical moment, the authors draw \nexpansive conclusions regarding the \u201ccolonization of everyday life,\u201d a process \nthey describe as \u201cglobalization turned inward . . . mapping and enclosing the hin-\nterland of the social, and carving out from the detail of human inventiveness an \never more ramified and standardized market of exchangeable subjectivities\u201d (AP, \n20). As RETORT ultimately argues, in a world saturated with \u201cimages, instruc-\ntions, slogans, logos, false promises, virtual realities [and] miniature happiness \nmotifs,\u201d the Left needs \u201csightlines in a new, nightmarish, terrain\u201d (AP, 8, 15). It is \nthese sightlines, they declare, that Afflicted Powers provides.\nChapter 2 (\u201cBlood for Oil?\u201d) takes issue with the popular notion that the war \nin Iraq is all about oil. It begins by outlining the \u201cblood for oil\u201d argument, then \ncontextualizes the oil imperative in a broader context of \u201cmilitary neoliberal-\nism.\u201d RETORT argues that oil must be viewed in relation to a wider strategy of \n\u201copening\u201d Iraq for capital: \u201ca radical, punitive \u2018extra-economic\u2019 restructuring of \nthe conditions necessary for expanded profitability \u2014 paving the way, in short, \nfor new rounds of US-led dispossession and capital accumulation. This was a \n7.

Chapter 3 (\u201cPermanent War\u201d) provides a historical \ndiscussion of U.S. imperialism and positions the Bush administration as part of \na longue dur\u00e9e, rather than the instigation of a new imperial moment.8 Perhaps \nmost compellingly, RETORT argues that what passes for peace has in fact come \nto represent an \u201cendless series of wars\u201d (AP, 93).9 Times of \u201cpeace\u201d in the United \nStates are in fact often times of war elsewhere: that the violence integral to the \nvagaries of primitive accumulation occurs \u201cout there\u201d is enough to maintain the \nfacade of peace \u201cover here.\u201d In making this argument, RETORT locates U.S. \nimperial conquest in an unbroken line stretching back almost two hundred years, \nmarking a \u201cstate of permanent war \u2014 of a long and consistent pattern of military \nexpansionalism in the service of empire . . . from the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 \nthrough the Cold War to the present\u201d (AP, 81). In recent years, they contend, this \nongoing imperialism-war-capital rubric has neoliberalized, leading to the hollow-\ning out of state welfare functions, the increasingly corporate nature of policy for-\nmulation, and the \u201cinfusion of handouts and investment with various neo-liberal \nconditions attached,\u201d which often follows U.S. military interventions (AP, 100). \nWhile this Euro-American narrative of neoliberal capitalist development on its \nown is not new, RETORT provocatively suggests that it corresponds to the devel-\nopment of \u201cweak citizenship,\u201d or what Cindi Katz neatly refers to as \u201cflailing \nconsumership\u201d (this issue). Specular citizenship thus conceived acts as a mirror \nto the actions of the U.S. state, whereby rights and responsibilities morph into the \ntwinned practices of accumulation and consumption.\nChapter 4 (\u201cThe Future of an Illusion\u201d) focuses on Israel, in particular Israel as \na \u201cdouble identity\u201d of the U.S. state, a symbol of \u201ca market-enriched \u2018democratic\u2019 \nfuture: McJerusalem . . . hyper-militarized.\u201d Israel has \u201cmirrored and mesmerized\u201d \nthe American state \u201cas exemplar of a society in which total militarization and spec-\ntacular modernity were fully compatible\u201d (AP, 111). As Noel Castree writes in his \nreview of the book, this generates \u201cthe following fascinating question: \u2018Did the Iraq \ninvasion follow from the . . . recognition, finally, that Israel\u2019s time as projection of \nthe West \u2014 and an illusion \u2014 has come to an end?\u2019 \u201d10 In other words, can the Iraq \ninvasion \u201cbe understood as a delusional attempt to recreate the one-time \u2018success\u2019 \nof the Israeli lodestar\u201d? (AP, 112). The fifth chapter focuses on revolutionary Islam, \n8.

RETORT situates the informal settlement as a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d \nfor the \u201cvanguard ideal\u201d (AP, 173). The \u201cnew city dwellers\u201d of Asia and North \nAfrica are positioned (perhaps rather carelessly) as a source of terror, where Islam is \n\u201cmutating and metastasizing in the slum conurbations of World Bank World\u201d (AP, \n172 \u2013 73). As RETORT\u2019s treatment of the image politics of \u201crevolutionary Islam\u201d \nattests, spectacular politics are certainly not the domain of the state alone. Indeed, \nthey argue for the need to challenge \u201cthe whole texture of modernity\u201d (AP, 189). \nThis is a call for a critique of modernity from the Left that does not fall into familiar \nalternative (and rightist) tropes of \u201cnostalgia,\u201d \u201cdoom,\u201d or \u201ctradition\u201d and that devel-\nops a sustained critique of modernity that is \u201cnon-nostalgic, non-anathematizing, \nnon-regressive, non-fundamental, non-apologetic\u201d \u2014 in short, a critique that offers \nan alternative political grammar from the vanguard ideal propagated by \u201crevolu-\ntionary Islam,\u201d a critique not marked by a desire to \u201cgo back\u201d (AP, 185).\nBut as the interventions in this issue suggest, RETORT could go much farther in \npositing the study of \u201cspectacular politics\u201d as historically rich, locally varied, and \noften contradictory.11 For David Campbell, RETORT never fully comes to terms \nwith the dialectical nature of Debord\u2019s original insights on the relationship between \nimage and reality. As Campbell points out in this issue, there is a residual nostal-\ngia for an untainted \u201cReal\u201d where, for example, a more contingent critique of the \n\u201ctheo-econopolitical machine\u201d currently governing America would open a space \nfor greater critical reflection.12 W. J. T. Mitchell takes a similar view of RETORT\u2019s \ntreatment of spectacle: why not conceive of the spectacle as a site of struggle rather \nthan personifying it as \u201ca Baudrillardian \u2018Evil Demon of Images\u2019 \u201d? In Mitchell\u2019s \nview, the totalizing closure of the spectacle remains unavoidable, becoming \u201ctoo \npowerful, too all-explanatory\u201d (this issue). Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Tuathail (Gerard Toal) is con-\ncerned that \u201cRETORT gives in too much to the pleasures of polemic and hyperbole, \nencouraging a sweeping critical geopolitics that does not examine the specifics of \nparticular geopolitical crises\u201d (this issue). Katz suggests, in turn, a closer engage-\nment with other social formations through which the ties among politico-economic, \nmilitary, and spectacular power are sutured, especially the everyday practices and \nproductions of domesticized \u201chomeland\u201d security.\nDespite RETORT\u2019s elucidation of the spectacular nature of U.S. imperial sov-\n11.

More \nbroadly, the focus on the U.S. experience and on the United States as an imperial \nprogenitor contains a bias that effectively casts other histories and geographies \nof imperialism to the periphery. Although there have been important attempts \nto write a historical anthropology of imperialism, from the efforts by various \n\u201cdependency theorists\u201d to theorize underdevelopment in relation to colonialism \nand neocolonialism,13 as well as by scholars of colonization and decolonization \n(including Frantz Fanon and Ranajit Guha and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak of \nthe subaltern studies school),14 precious few recent interventions have built on \nthese efforts. The now-familiar shape of an emboldened American imperium has \nraised new questions about the nature of what Derek Gregory has called \u201cthe \ncolonial present\u201d and the perceived \u201cexceptionalism\u201d of U.S. imperialism.15 It \nis important to recognize the value, when we read Afflicted Powers, of \u201clook-\ning comparatively\u201d at the technologies of imperialism that are both particular \nto a time and space and resonant with wider global practices.16 James Fergu-\nson\u2019s work points, for example, to modes of Chinese imperialism at work in new \nforms of enclave capitalism through mineral extraction in various areas of south-\nern Africa.17 Despite the growing focus on U.S. imperialism, we need to remain \nattentive to other instances of imperial enclosure if we are to work toward a more \ncomparative understanding of empire that is capable of grappling with different \ndegrees of imperial sovereignty.18 This concern with the enclosures of the colonial \npresent also informs a wider set of issues that animate our own project of analyz-\ning the interarticulation of neoliberal norms and a resurgent and violent form of \ngeopolitics.19 That the \u201ctransformational sequence appropriation-displacement-\nPublic Culture\n5 38\nexploitation-accumulation\u201d is, in this context, operative across a range of scales, \nsites, and networks is quite clear.20 That this very sequence operates contingently, \nprovisionally, and violently still merits, we believe, further critical clarification.\nIn the case of RETORT, this is partly resolved through the rearticulation of a \nbroader argument about war. The collective writes, \u201cWar, in a word, is modernity \nincarnate\u201d (AP, 79). For RETORT, warfare\u2019s destruction of infrastructure is a serv-\nice to capital, setting the stage for \u201cthe trinity of crude accumulation: the enclo-\nsure and looting of resources; the creation of a cheap and deracinated labor force; \nand the establishment of captive markets\u201d (AP, 100). For us, RETORT points in \nthis instance to a critical relationship among war, modernity, and infrastructure, \na relationship that blurs the boundaries between war and peace. In the destruction \nof water, sewage, electricity, communication, and transport infrastructures, war is \nincreasingly an act of \u201cde-modernization\u201d that targets \u201cdual-use infrastructures\u201d \n(military and civilian) and that permeates everyday life long after the bombing has \nstopped.21 There are echoes here of Hardt and Antonio Negri\u2019s discussion of war as \ncentral to the reproduction of social life,22 where state descriptions of everyday life \nas potential terrorist target legitimizes, in Stephen Graham\u2019s words, \u201cthe deepening \nof national security controls, the post-9\/11 surveillance \u2018surge,\u2019 and the notion that \ncontinuous, pre-emptive and expeditionary wars must be waged by the US to safe-\nguard the securitized cities of \u2018homeland\u2019 from the pervasive yet vague anxieties of \npermanent \u2018terror.\u2019 \u201d23 In the context of such securitized and militarized social life, \nRETORT argues that the Left must focus critique on both military neoliberalism \nand the modernity with which it is entangled. If Afflicted Powers only begins the \nprocess of addressing such critiques, it demonstrates the possibilities of collabora-\ntive work by producing a critical and distinct contribution to our understanding of \ncontemporary imperialism that reveals the urgent need to reformulate critique. With \nfaith in the possibility of alternative horizons, we hope that this collection echoes \nthis spirit of conversation and action.\n20.
