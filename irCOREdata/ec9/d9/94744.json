Green\nThe historically constructed nature of ethnicity has become a widely accepted paradigm in the social sciences. Scholars have espe-\ncially have focused on the ways modern states have been able to create and change ethnic identities, with perhaps the strongest case\nstudies coming from colonial Africa, where the gap between strong states and weak societies has been most apparent. I suggest,\nhowever, that in order to better understand how and when ethnic change occurs it is important to examine case studies where\nstate-directed ethnic change has failed. To rectify this oversight I examine the case of the \u201clost counties\u201d of Uganda, which were\ntransferred from the Bunyoro kingdom to the Buganda kingdom at the onset of colonial rule. I show that British attempts to assim-\nilate the Banyoro residents in two of the lost counties were an unmitigated failure, while attempts in the other five counties were\nsuccessful. I claim that the reason for these differing outcomes lies in the status of the two lost counties as part of the historic Bunyoro\nhomeland, whereas the other five counties were both geographically and symbolically peripheral to Bunyoro.The evidence here thus\nsuggests that varying ethnic attachments to territory can lead to differing outcomes in situations of state-directed assimilation and\nethnic change.\nT he historically constructed nature of ethnicity hasbecome a widely accepted paradigm in the socialsciences over the past several decades. As a result of\nthe backlash against the formerly dominant primordialist\nparadigm, whereby ethnic groups were deemed to be\nancient and unchanging, it is now posited that ethnicity\ncan be created and shaped by economic or political insti-\ntutions. This argument\u2014whose advocates are usually\ngrouped under the term \u201cconstructivism\u201d\u2014has been elu-\ncidated in a variety of contexts.1\nThis shift has resulted in a large amount of recent\nresearch into how and when states have been able to cre-\nate, shape and even eliminate ethnic and national groups.\nMuch focus has been given to the process of state-directed\nassimilation of ethnic minorities and immigrants into a\ndominant majority national culture.2 Yet, considering the\nlong history of social bonds outside the realms of the state\nin the western world, many scholars have disputed the\nability of modern states like the U.S. and France to enforce\nassimilation of its ethnic and immigrant minorities.3 If,\nthen, the goal of this constructivist shift in the study of\nethnicity is to investigate how and when political phenom-\nena affect ethnic identity, it is not clear that western nation-\nstates are ideal case studies. Rather, one would need to\nfind both strong states, with autonomy from civil society\nand the bureaucratic means to carry out social projects,\nand weak societies unable to counter the effects of these\nstates. Indeed, as suggested by James Scott in his analysis\nof modern statehood, the most severe state-initiated social\nengineering requires both an authoritarian state \u201cwilling\nand able to use the full weight of its coercive power\u201d and\n\u201ca prostrate civil society that lacks the capacity to resist\nthese plans.\u201d4\nIn this sense it may be that the African colonial state\ncan provide such a best case scenario for the study of\nstate-directed ethnic change for two reasons. First, colo-\nnial states held modern authoritarian bureaucratic power\nautonomous from those Africans over whom they ruled.\nIn the extreme way they were organized for the purpose of\nextraction and repression, African colonial states were pos-\nsibly more similar in their absolutism to the ancient regime\nof France than contemporary European governments or\nprevious colonial states in the Americas or Asia.5 Second,\nas African pre-colonial societies were characterized by low\npopulation densities, fragile indigenous states, and ethni-\ncally diverse populations, they would have been in a\nElliott D.

Moreover,\nthe effect of colonization itself, especially through war and\nthe arbitrary creation of boundaries cutting across soci-\neties, weakened much of what existed of pre-colonial civil\nsociety. Thus the gap between this strong colonial state,\nwhich Crawford Young calls \u201cthe purest modern form of\nautonomous bureaucratic autocracy,\u201d6 and the frag-\nmented and weak societies across the continent means\nthat the African colonial state is an ideal case study for\nstate-directed social change.\nAs expected, a variety of scholars have taken up this\nresearch challenge, noting the ways colonial states created,\nshaped, and changed ethnic identities in Africa.7 Through\nthe drawing of colonial boundaries and the help of admin-\nistrators and missionaries, the African colonial state was\nable to delineate new ethnic groups, amalgamate others,\nand even, in the case of the Herero of German South-\nWest Africa, come close to eliminating at least one ethnic\ngroup in an early example of modern genocide.8 Indeed,\neven those who have claimed the African colonial state to\nbe much weaker than is normally claimed still agree that it\nwas able to shape ethnic identities in quite profound ways.9\nYet much of this recent research on ethnicity and the\nAfrican colonial state has suffered from a problem of selec-\ntion bias. More specifically, constructivists have tended to\ncontrast those ethnic groups invented by colonialists with\nthose that already existed and thus did not need to be\ninvented. What is missing in this account is an investiga-\ntion into instances of ethnic groups that colonialists\nattempted but failed to invent, which would provide us\nwith means to understand the limits to state-directed eth-\nnic change. If no such examples exist or can be explained\naway as exceptional, then we should be able to confirm\nthe proposition that modern nation-states are indeed able\nto shape local ethnic identities in a profound way. How-\never, if we can find an anomaly of failed assimilation in\nwhat should be a best or \u201ccrucial case\u201d scenario for the\nstudy of state-led ethnic change, then we would better\nunderstand how and why ethnic change does not occur.10\nTo rectify this oversight, in this essay I examine the case\nof the so-called \u201cLost Counties\u201d of Uganda, which British\nofficials transferred from the Bunyoro kingdom to the\nBuganda kingdom at the onset of colonial rule. I show\nthat attempts to assimilate the Banyoro residents of two of\nthe five lost counties, Buyaga and Bugangaizi, into Bugan-\ndan society over the colonial period were an unmitigated\nfailure, a fact most evident in the overwhelming vote for\nsecession from Buganda in a 1964 referendum in the two\ncounties. However, the Ugandan colonial state was much\nmore successful at assimilating residents of the other five\nlost counties, inasmuch as there has been neither a demand\nfor a referendum on secession from Buganda nor any indi-\ncation in census records or popular politics that these res-\nidents continue to define themselves as Banyoro. I claim\nthat the reason why the colonial state was unable to pro-\nmote assimilation of the Banyoro of Buyaga and Bugan-\ngaizi into Buganda was due to the pre-colonial status of\nBuyaga and Bugangaizi as part of the core Bunyoro \u201chome-\nland\u201d and the subsequent strong ethnic attachment to the\ntwo counties; the colonial state was more successful in the\nother lost counties because of their lack of homeland sta-\ntus. This evidence thereby demonstrates that the presence\nor absence of homelands and the resulting varying inten-\nsity of pre-existing ethnic identities can explain the differ-\ning abilities of states to assimilate ethnic groups. As such,\nthe case of the lost counties suggests that even the stron-\ngest of states are limited in their ability to alter strongly-\nheld identities with territorial roots, a lesson that has\nimplications for assimilation policies in the modern world.\nThis article is structured as follows. I examine construc-\ntivist theories of ethnic change in relation to colonial Africa.\nI then show in how the colonial administration in the lost\ncounties encouraged assimilation and ethnic change\nthrough a variety of means but nonetheless failed in its\nefforts. The reason for this failure, I argue, lies in the\npre-colonial history of the lost counties. Finally, I con-\nclude by suggesting implications of the article as regards\nthe relationship between the modern state and ethnicity.\nOn the Colonial Creation of Ethnicity\nUp until around 1970, the primordialist paradigm of eth-\nnicity held dominance among academics, colonial officials,\nand others. This thesis held that Africans were all members\nof \u201ctribes,\u201d which had existed since ancient times in an\nunchanged state. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, anthro-\npologists took the lead in suggesting that \u201ctribes\u201d\u2014which\nthey suggested should henceforth be known as \u201cethnic\ngroups,\u201d as they were elsewhere in the world\u2014were in fact\nof modern origin.11 Over the next three decades many schol-\nars developed the argument that ethnic groups were more\nspecifically of colonial origin and that they were constructed\nor invented during colonial rule through a variety of means,\nincluding mapping regions and the work of missionaries,\nlocal colonial officials and anthropologists.12\nThe most powerful critique of colonial practice has come\nfrom those scholars who have argued that the colonial state\nitself had the largest influence in (re)creating and inventing\nethnic groups.13 This process lay in the belief among the\ncolonial powers that Africans naturally lived in \u201ctribes,\u201d each\ncomplete with its own homeland, culture, language and\npolitical institutions. Due in part to the ideology of nation-\nalismthen sweepingEurope, colonialists often idealized these\npre-colonial \u201ctribes\u201d and set out to perpetuate their politi-\ncal institutions through the policy of indirect rule as a means\nto preserve them against the onslaught of modernity. Thus\ncolonialists set up a system of local political units which,\nideally, were ethnically homogenous and ruled by \u201ctribal\nchiefs\u201d according to \u201ctribal custom.\u201d However, this motive\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nArticles | Understanding the Limits to Ethnic Change\n474 Perspectives on Politics\nexisted alongside the economic imperative of running col-\nonies on the cheap, which meant that colonial powers were\noften led to create new languages, new political and legal\ninstitutions, new \u201cinvented traditions\u201d and, in effect, new\nethnic groups altogether in order to better administer their\nnew territories.\nOver the course of colonial rule Africans legitimated\nthese new ethnic identities in two ways. First, politics in\nrural areas was structured through these local \u201ctribal\u201d units,\nthereby leading Africans to mobilize politically along eth-\nnic rather than national lines. Second, in responding to\nthe uncertainties and moral crises of colonialism and\nmodernity more generally, Africans sought refuge and\nfound meaning in ethnicity.14 Thus, by the end of colo-\nnialism, the new ethnic entities created at its onset had\nnot only taken hold but had become perhaps the most\nimportant source of social cleavage in Africa.\nThis argument has gained much weight within the field\nof African studies, leading Patrick Chabal and Jean-Pascal\nDaloz to write that \u201cthere is now ample evidence of what\nhas been called the \u2018invention of ethnicity,\u2019 by which is\nmeant the ways in which it was constructed and instru-\nmentalized during the colonial period.\u201d15 Yet some schol-\nars as have attempted to balance out this analysis with a\nmore nuanced approach, arguing that invention was a\nmatter of degree, since, while some ethnic groups were\ninvented under colonialism, many other ethnic groups\ncould trace their continuity back to the pre-colonial era.\nFor instance, Crawford Young contrasts the Baganda and\nBanyoro, \u201cwhose political identity readily translated into\nethnic ideology,\u201d with other Ugandan \u201cnovel ethnic enti-\nties\u201d like the Acholi, Bagisu, and Bakiga.16\nIn other words, for the purposes of colonial adminis-\ntration some\u2014in fact, most\u2014ethnic groups needed to be\ninvented while others like the Baganda and Banyoro did\nnot, and the roles of the administrative \u201cchiefs\u201d in the\nlatter case could be adapted from pre-colonial times rather\nthan invented out of thin air. As a result, many scholars\nwould agree with Chabal and Daloz that \u201csome ethnic\ngroups were more creatively invented during colonial rule\nthan others,\u201d17 and their task is to elucidate the nature\nand extent of this invention. Yet, as we are about to see,\nthis paradigm fails to account for the varied outcomes of\nUganda\u2019s lost counties, where the colonial state was unable\nto promote assimilation along the lines suggested by\nconstructivism.\nHow the Lost Counties Were Lost\nWhen the first European explorers arrived in the 1860s in\nwhat is now Uganda, the kingdom of Buganda was at the\nheight of its political powers over neighboring kingdoms\non the north shore of Lake Victoria. To its north was the\nformerly powerful kingdom of Bunyoro, which had once\ncontrolled large sections of what is now southern and south-\nwest Uganda but had been declining in regional power\nand influence since the seventeenth century. After a highly\ntumultuous period in the 1880s whereby roughly equal\nhalves of the Bugandan population were converted to Prot-\nestantism and Catholicism, the British were able to sign a\ntreaty with the Kabaka (king) of Buganda and then use\nBuganda as a base for extending their rule throughout the\nsurrounding area. Colonel Henry Colivile was assigned in\n1893 to take control of the Nile basin north of Buganda,\nwhich inevitably led to clashes with the obstinate Kaba-\nlega, the Omukama (king) of Bunyoro, whose troops Coliv-\nile pushed back to north of the Kafu river before conquering\nthe kingdom altogether. This war of pacification was\nextremely bloody: while the full scale of the violence is\nunclear, it is certain that it led to the deaths or forced\nmigration of a large majority of the kingdom\u2019s subjects, a\ndemographic collapse from which the Banyoro did not\nrecover for more than a half-century.18\nBefore ending his tour of duty in 1894, Colonel Coliv-\nile promised conquered territory south of the Kafu River\nto Bugandan chiefs (refer to map 1). Colvile\u2019s successor,\nEJL Berkeley wrote that\nThe annexed provinces in becoming part of the Kingdom of\nUganda, must, of course recognize the sovereignty of the King of\nUganda, the supremacy and authority of the chiefs selected (with\nthe approval of Her Majesty\u2019s Commissioner) to govern them,\nand they must understand that henceforth they are subject to all\nlaws, regulations, obligations as to local taxation and tribute, etc.\nthat are in force in the other parts of the Kingdom. At the same\ntime, however, that these provinces became part of the Kingdom\nof Uganda so would their native inhabitants become Waganda,\nand, as such, entitled to all the public and private rights of\nWaganda in any other part of the Kingdom.19\nIn other words, Berkeley did not see a reason why those\ninhabitants of the region who had survived the pacifica-\ntion war would not assimilate into Buganda as they were\ngoverned by Bugandan chiefs and laws. Thus Berkeley\u2019s\nconception that the resident Banyoro would \u201cbecome\nWaganda\u201d because they were now part of the Buganda\nkingdom corresponds exactly to the constructivist para-\ndigm of ethnicity conforming to colonial administrative\nboundaries rather than the other way around.\nDespite the fact that resistance to the transfer began\nimmediately, Berkeley\u2019s successors nonetheless accepted the\nannexation as final. It did not matter that only later, after\nthe lost counties had been incorporated into Mubende\ndistrict, did the British find out that the lost counties\nhosted all the tombs of all former Abakama (kings) of\nBunyoro, for which they allowed the Bunyoro Native Gov-\nernment to appoint a special salaried chief (the Mugema)\nto reside in Buganda and look after the tombs in 1915.\nIndeed, the British continued to ignore the nine formal\nrequests of various Abakama to have the matter investi-\ngated between 1931 and 1958, while similarly denying\nthe requests of the Mubende Banyoro Committee (MBC),\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nSeptember 2008 | Vol. 6\/No. 3 475\na local political group formed in 1921, to the Secretary of\nState for the Colonies in 1951, 1953, and 1955 and the\nrequest of the Legislative Council member for Bunyoro,\nGBK Magezi, in 1955. Repeatedly British officials claimed\nthat, in the words of Governor Frederick Crawford in\n1957, \u201cnothing can be done about that now,\u201d or, in the\nwords of the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1931,\n\u201cit is a long time [since the lost counties were incorpo-\nrated into Buganda] and this matter was settled during\nthe time of fighting, so we cannot now do anything fur-\nther in the matter.\u201d20 The multiple pleas by the Banyoro\npetitioners exasperated British officials like Chief Secre-\ntary C.H. Hartwell, who in 1955 stated that \u201cin a matter\nof this kind there must be some finality, and in this case it\nmust be accepted that the final decision has been taken.\u201d21\nThere is no doubt that the British were content to have\nthe issue of the lost counties disappear through the assim-\nilation of the resident Banyoro, a point admitted by Gov-\nernor Crawford when he wrote that \u201cthere is some evidence\nthat deliberate attempts were made to assimilate the\nBanyoro in the \u2018lost counties\u2019 and that in the 1930s these\nattempts were encouraged by the Protectorate Govern-\nment.\u201d22 One must assume that Crawford was referring\nto the recommendation by the District Commissioner of\nMubende in the 1930s that, due to \u201csporadic unrest\u201d that\ntroubled Buyaga and Bugangaizi \u201cthroughout the colonial\nperiod,\u201d the Mugema should be removed \u201con the ground\nthat he represented the opinion of only a small fraction of\nthe Banyoro.\u201d23\nYet this strategy of assimilation was by no means lim-\nited to the 1930s, nor was it limited to exerting influence\nover the Buganda kingdom officials who governed the lost\ncounties. Indeed, the Buganda kingdom government,\nwhich had existed in pre-colonial times but whose powers\nto enforce \u201ctribal customs\u201d were greatly increased by the\nBritish, used a variety of means to promote assimilation in\nthe lost counties. For instance, a representative from the\narea to the Uganda Constitutional Conference in 1961\nclaimed that, \u201cif the Banyoro do anything in a way differ-\nent from that practiced by Baganda, they are liable to be\nMap 1\nAreas (in grey) transferred to Buganda in 1893\nSource: Munster Commission 1961.\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nArticles | Understanding the Limits to Ethnic Change\n476 Perspectives on Politics\nprosecuted for breach of Kiganda customary law,\u201d includ-\ning barring \u201cthe inhabitants of the lost counties from danc-\ning and singing in their traditional Kinyoro style.\u201d24 In\nhis petition to the British government on the issue\nOmukama Tito Winyi also noted that in the lost counties\n\u201cdancing in the Kinyoro style is illegal, and all dancing\nmust be in the Kiganda style, which is foreign to the\nBanyoro people.\u201d25\nAttempts to assimilate the Banyoro in the lost counties\nhardly stopped at the dancehall doors. More generally, in\na classic assimilationist strategy,26 the Buganda Kingdom\ngovernment both created incentives for assimilation and,\nperhaps more importantly, failed to discriminate against\nresident Banyoro along ethnic lines. In this sense it is clear\nthat local Banyoro were not treated as badly as some Bun-\nyoro kingdom officials claimed:27 as Governor Crawford\nnoted,\nit is a matter of opinion whether the Baganda have deliberately\nattempted to keep the Banyoro in a state of inferiority and to\neliminate Kinyoro customs and the Lunyoro language. The\nBaganda definitely look upon the inhabitants of the county as\nBaganda or potential Baganda, and would see no reason why\nthey should be treated as a tribal minority.28\nOne assimilative strategy in the lost counties was the\nuniform use of Luganda and not Lunyoro as an official\nlanguage, a fact noted by the MBC in 1960: \u201cthe suppres-\nsion of our mother tongue, Lunyoro, hurts us beyond\nimagination. Our children are taught in a foreign lan-\nguage in the very first years of their education, and . . . our\nlanguage has been banned in Court, Offices, Churches in\naddition to Schools.\u201d29 Yet colonial officials neither saw a\nneed to set up Lunyoro-language schools nor did they feel\nthat the native Banyoro should have a problem learning\nLuganda. For instance, Governor Crawford claimed that\n\u201cLuganda And Lunyoro are both Bantu languages with\ngreat similarities. . . A Munyoro [singular of Banyoro] liv-\ning in Buganda has very little difficulty in learning to\nspeak Luganda fluently.\u201d30 The Molson Commission,\nwhose job it was to recommend a resolution to the dis-\npute over the lost counties before Ugandan indepen-\ndence, agreed, noting that\nour impression is that the majority of Banyoro have little prac-\ntical difficulty with Luganda. We regard the question of language\nas essentially a political issue of a kind common in many coun-\ntries. From a purely administrative point of view, it is natural\nand reasonable that the Kabaka\u2019s Government should insist on\nthe use of a single language throughout its administrative, judi-\ncial and educational systems.31\nAs a result, British officials did not see a problem in either\nforcing Banyoro to speak, read, and write Luganda or\neven register themselves as with Bugandan names. Omu-\nkama Winyi complained that \u201cwhen the Banyoro go to\nregister births at the Gombolola [sub-county] offices, they\nare compelled to enter in the register a Luganda name for\nthe child, and to register his clan according to the Kiganda\nclan system and not the Kinyoro system.\u201d32 Again, the\nMolson Commission noted\nit is understandable that the Kabaka\u2019s Government should per-\nsuade and encourage alien tribesmen living in Buganda to regard\nthemselves as Baganda. The use of Baganda names would be a\nnatural outcome of this policy; and indeed, such a policy was\npositively encouraged by Mr. Berkeley, the then Commissioner\nof Uganda, as early as 1896.33\nGoing so far to even call this policy a \u201clegitimate attempt\nby the Buganda authorities at assimilation,\u201d the Molson\nCommission suggested that the reason some Banyoro\nchanged their names to Bugandan ones was \u201ceither because\nthey have come to regard themselves as Baganda, or because\nthey feel that the path of life will be easier for doing so.\u201d34\nThe assumption that Banyoro would have an easier \u201cpath\nof life\u201d with a Bugandan name also applied to Buganda\nkingdom government university scholarships. After a trip\nto the region in 1957 the British MP Eirene White com-\nplained that the only way for a resident Munyoro to get a\nuniversity scholarship is \u201cto declare that he is a Bagan-\nda,\u201d35 a point repeated by Omukama Winyi in his claim\nthat only \u201cpure Baganda\u201d could be considered for a Buganda\nbursary or scholarship. \u201cIf an applicant for such a schol-\narship states on his application form that he is a member\nof any tribe other than the Baganda, his application is not\neven considered.\u201d36\nAs with forcing Banyoro to register themselves with\nLuganda-language names, such a strategy of only allowing\nBaganda to receive university scholarships created signifi-\ncant incentives for Banyoro to self-identify as Baganda.\nSimultaneously, however, there is little evidence that\nBanyoro suffered severely from a lack of education that\nwould have prevented them from competing with other\nresidents of Baganda for jobs and scholarships. While sta-\ntistics do not exist for the general well-being of the Banyoro\nin the lost counties, we can take the population of Mubende\ndistrict, 70.0 percent of whom were registered as Banyoro\nin the 1948 Census,37 as a proxy for the treatment of\nBanyoro in Buganda. In doing so we can see the lack of\nany overt discrimination: indeed, according to Governor\nCrawford \u201cthe percentage of places available in primary\nschools in relation to child population [in 1959] is higher\nin Mubende District (57.4) than that in Buganda as a\nwhole (51.9)\u201d and the Protectorate (49.3).38 Similarly, by\n1959 the percentage of men in Mubende district who had\nattended school at some point was, at 47.9 percent, higher\nthan in East Mengo (44.4 percent) or Masaka (42.9 per-\ncent) districts, an impressive achievement considering that\nmen over 45 in Mubende had the lowest schooling rates\nin Buganda. While the percentage of women in Mubende\nwho had attended school was the lowest among the four\ndistricts, as indicated in table 1 the gap between Mubende\nand West Mengo had lessened from a ratio of 11.6 to 1 for\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nSeptember 2008 | Vol. 6\/No. 3 477\nthose educated in the 1920s to 1.4 to 1 by the 1950s. This\nshould be seen as a considerable achievement if one recalls\nthat Mubende district was cut off from both railroad and\nlake transportation and that the population density in\nMubende was only 37.1 people per square mile in 1959,\nfar below that of the Bugandan average of 113.7 and even\nless than the average of 38.9 in the North.39\nFinally, with the exception of the initial colonial period\nthere is little evidence that the Banyoro in the lost coun-\nties were poorly treated in comparison to other inhabit-\nants in similarly outlying areas of Buganda or even in\nregards to residents of Buganda as a whole; in this sense it\nwould have been difficult to support an anti-Buganda cam-\npaign in the lost counties on the basis of unequal treat-\nment. From 1929 through 1951 the poll tax in Mubende\ndistrict was only 10 Ush per person, as compared to 15\nUsh elsewhere in Buganda and 18 Ush in nearby Lango.40\nFurthermore, residents of the lost counties were relatively\nhealthy compared to the rest of the population: there were\nthree times more hospital beds and twice as many medical\nstaff per 100,000 residents at government hospitals in\nMubende than in West Mengo, and Buyaga and Bugan-\ngaizi did not, unlike other counties in Buganda, suffer\nfrom any tsetse fly problems. Similarly, as regards efforts\nto eliminate leprosy, the Government of Buganda noted\nthat \u201cmuch progress and most satisfactory results have\nbeen achieved in Mubende district, that there is much to\nbe done in Mengo district and that in Masaka district we\nhave almost to start from scratch.\u201d41\nWhen discrimination did take place, however, Banyoro\ncould rely upon relatively equal and fair treatment by the\nBugandan government. As one British government com-\nmission noted, \u201cwe were constantly told of a woman who\nhad been fined for speaking the language of Bunyoro in\ncourt, but the complainants never mentioned that the\nconviction was reversed on appeal by the Principal Court\nof Buganda.\u201d42 Similarly, the most-cited example of sup-\nposed discrimination against the Banyoro\u2014namely that\ntheir land was taken away from them in the 1900 Agree-\nment between the British and Bugandan government and\ngiven to absentee Bugandan landlords, leaving them with\nonly 70 of the 2995 square miles in the two counties43\u2014\nappears less egregious when one considers that the Agree-\nment \u201cdispossessed in equal measure the majority of the\nBaganda peasantry of their occupancy rights. . . The jus-\ntification for the 1900 Land Settlement may be debatable,\nbut we are satisfied that it was applied uniformly to Baganda\nand Banyoro.\u201d44 The same qualification goes for the total\nlack of any Banyoro appointed as county chiefs for the\ntwo lost counties over the whole colonial period, as county\nchiefs were almost always appointed from among the land-\nholding elite,45 while the Banyoro as a whole in Buganda\nwere nonetheless overrepresented among government\nemployees.46\nExplaining Ethnicity in the Lost\nCounties\nDespite these various attempts at assimilating the Banyoro\ninto Buganda, towards the end of colonial rule British\nofficials like Governor Crawford had begun to admit that\nthese efforts had \u201cnot, however, met with any conspicuous\nsuccess.\u201d47 Yet the question remains as to why indigenous\nBanyoro in Buyaga and Bugangaizi failed to assimilate\ninto Buganda when the Buganda kingdom was able to\nassimilate non-Baganda at other times and in other places.\nIn pre-colonial times the Buganda kingdom had been quite\ncapable of assimilating conquered peoples, including the\nresidents of southern area of Buddu (comprising the con-\ntemporary district of Masaka; refer to map 1). After\nBuganda invaded the area sometime around 1800, the\nBuddu residents were assimilated to the point where, after\nfour generations at the most, they spoke Luganda without\na trace of Lunyoro or even a regional dialect.48\nThe Baganda were well known for their ability to assim-\nilate other peoples in the colonial period as well, most\nobviously in the case of the numerous Banyarwanda who\nmigrated from Rwanda from the 1920s through the 1950s.\nThis population, which was largely Hutu and was thus\nbetter able to fit into the \u201cagrarian cultural context\u201d of\nTable 1\nPercentages of the population of Buganda in 1959 who had ever attended school,\nby age\nMale Female\n6\u201315 16\u201345 Over 45 6\u201315 16\u201345 Over 45\nWest Mengo 65.9 61.7 36.7 57.7 46.5 13.9\nEast Mengo 55.8 46.9 26.8 45.7 32.5 8.2\nMubende 58.9 54.6 19.1 40.2 22.2 1.2\nMasaka 51.3 46.9 23.0 43.6 28.4 3.8\nSource: Protectorate of Uganda 1961.\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nArticles | Understanding the Limits to Ethnic Change\n478 Perspectives on Politics\nBuganda, \u201csought to become a part of the local society,\ngradually assimilating, taking on local names, clan affilia-\ntions, spouses and even an overall identity.\u201d49 As a result\nthe Banyarwanda went from 5.9 percent of the Ugandan\npopulation in 1959 to only 1.3 percent by 2002.\nA similar phenomenon of assimilation took place among\nother non-Baganda, including the Banyoro in the other\nlost counties.50 As the Molson Commission noted, \u201cin\nBuwekula and in the areas to the east there are indications\nthat a number of Banyoro have been assimilated success-\nfully by the Baganda,\u201d as indicated by relatively high rates\nof intermarriage between Banyoro and Baganda.51 While\nthe British were unequivocal in noting that the popula-\ntion of Buruli and Bugerere counties were initially \u201centirely\nmade up of Banyoro\u201d and \u201cchiefly Banyoro,\u201d respective-\nly,52 by the end of the colonial era neither Bugerere, Buruli\nnor Buwekula had anything close to a majority Banyoro\npopulation. Indeed, colonial census data shows both a\nsharp fall in the percentage of Banyoro as well as a rise in\nthe number of Baganda recorded in the five counties\nbetween 1921 and 1959 despite the documented migra-\ntion of Baganda away from these border counties.53\nThis phenomenon is perhaps most obvious when one\nnotes the complete absence of any serious movement to be\nreincorporated into Bunyoro in the other lost counties over\nthe past century, despite both the failure of the British to\ngrant any of the other counties a referendum along with\nBuyaga and Bugangaizi and the persistent and ongoing\nattempts of the Bunyoro kingdom and the MBC to return\nall five counties to Bunyoro. Of these areas only the indig-\nenous population of the district of Nakasongola, who largely\nnow call themselves members of the Baruli ethnic group,54\nhave had any hesitation in their loyalty to the Buganda\nkingdom. Yet despite the claim that \u201cBaruli are actually\nBanyoro but they are mixed up,\u201d55 there is little to no evi-\ndence that any significant number of Baruli are interested\nin returning to Bunyoro.56 This difference with Buyaga and\nBugangaizi\u2014whichcomprisemodern-dayKibaaledistrict\u2014\nwas most striking in the constitutional process of the early\n1990s, when Ugandans had the opportunity to voice their\nopinions about the future political structure of Uganda.\nOf the official submissions from the former lost counties,\nwhich had by then become five district governments, Kibaale\nwas the only one which expressed any dissatisfaction with\nbeing part of a reconstituted Bugandan kingdom.57\nYet one possible response could be to claim that the\npopulation changes were less a result of assimilation than\nof migration flows, specifically the influx of Baganda and\nforeign immigrants such as the Banyarwanda and Barundi,\nwho went from a negligible percentage of the Bugandan\npopulation to 19.3 percent between 1921 and 1959, and\nthe outflow of Banyoro to other parts of Uganda. While it\nis true that some Banyoro did migrate to neighboring\nareas like Lango and Bunyoro itself,58 there is little evi-\ndence that migration flows could fully account for such a\ndrastic change in the ethnic composition of the lost coun-\nties. Indeed, the percentage of Banyoro residents decreased\nin other surrounding counties in Buganda and Busoga as\nwell as in Kampala between 1921 and 1959. Further-\nmore, as table 2 indicates, migrating groups of Ban-\nyarwanda and Barundi largely avoided the lost counties,\nas did neighboring groups like the Basoga (from the east)\nand the Banyankole (from the west). Similarly, none of\nthe lost counties saw any significant influx of Baganda\nduring the colonial period, partially due to the climate in\nthe eastern lost counties being more suitable to cassava\nand millet than to the plantain, the staple food of the\nBugandan diet, and also due to the counties\u2019 geographical\nremoteness from any major transportation hubs.59\nThus assimilation must account for at least some of the\ndisparate paths during the colonial period of Buyaga and\nBugangaizi on the one hand and the other lost counties\nTable 2\nPercentage of selected ethnic groups in the five lost counties\nCounty Census Baganda Banyoro Banyankole Basoga Banyarwanda Barundi\nBuruli 1921 12.3 86.5 0.1 0.5 * *\n1959 60.1 2.2 13.2 0.2 1.8 0.3\nBugerere 1921 19.9 74.5 0.2 3.7 * *\n1959 34.7 0.5 3.1 9.2 3.8 7.4\nBuwekula 1921 41.6 60.4 1.7 0.0 * *\n1959 56.6 13.1 9.7 0.0 5.7 0.5\nBuyaga 1921 5.4 94.4 0.1 0.0 * *\n1959 5.6 80.4 0.2 0.0 2.2 0.2\nBugangaizi 1921 10.2 89.6 0.0 0.0 * *\n1959 19.2 75.6 0.2 0.9 2.0 0.3\n*Not recorded in census data\nSources: Protectorate of Uganda 1921, Protectorate of Uganda 1961.\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nSeptember 2008 | Vol. 6\/No. 3 479\non the other. The most plausible explanation for this dif-\nference lies not, however, in any colonial policies, but rather\nin the pre-colonial past. As with the Baganda, Ban-\nyarwanda and other kingdom groups in the Great Lakes\nregion, the Banyoro ethnic group owes its existence to the\npre-colonial Bunyoro kingdom which had formerly dom-\ninated the region. For most of the pre-colonial period\nBuyaga and Bugangaizi lay at the heart of this kingdom,\ninasmuch as these two counties held most of the tombs of\nthe former Abakama. These tombs would have been situ-\nated after a king\u2019s death either near a site of great impor-\ntance during his lifetime or near the royal house;60 along\nwith other sacred sites, these tombs, while not well kept,\nwere nonetheless considered important enough to be\nmarked on maps of the area and continued to hold a\nsignificant amount of symbolic importance for the Banyoro\nin the colonial period.61 Indeed, in his ethnographic field\nwork in the 1950s John Beattie noted that tombs were\nconsidered \u201cnational shrines\u201d and that all Banyoro with\nwhom he spoke \u201cknew that Buyaga and Bugangaizi coun-\nties had been the centre of the traditional Nyoro king-\ndom, and, despite their alienation, in an important sense\nthey still were.\u201d62\nHowever, the kingdom had only weak control over the\nother five lost counties in the pre-colonial period. As\nwith the aforementioned case of Buddu, which was merely\n\u201cin the orbit of Bunyoro\u201d and was thus \u201cineffectively\nruled,\u201d63 the Bunyoro kingdom was in effective occupa-\ntion of only some sections of the other five counties,\nwhich were largely frontier lands.64 Specifically, while\nBugerere and other frontier counties may have techni-\ncally been under the aegis of the Omukama, Beattie notes\nthat pre-colonial Bunyoro nonetheless suffered from a\nlack of uniform government: \u201cthe more widely dispersed\nNyoro state was very much less evenly administered [than\nBuganda, and] although in theory the Omukama\u2019s power\nwas absolute, in day to day matters his authority declined\nas one approached the peripheral areas of the king-\ndom.\u201d65 The long-standing frontier status of these coun-\nties explains why none of the Abakama from the late\nseventeenth century onwards were buried there.66\nIn other words, what made these two areas different\nwas that Buyaga and Bugangaizi, with their sacred sites\nand royal tombs, comprised part of the historic \u201chome-\nland\u201d of Bunyoro, whereas the other counties were both\ngeographically and symbolically peripheral to Bunyoro.\nFor Anthony Smith, Monica Toft, and other scholars, a\nhomeland is a key part of ethnic identity, in that it ties\ncurrent generations of an ethnic group to older ones\nthrough the collection of myths and memories connect-\ning the group\u2019s ancestors and the territory in question.\nThis ethnic association with the territory, however, means\nas well that \u201cthe land\u2019s resources also become exclusive to\nthe people; they are not for \u2018alien\u2019 use and exploitation,\u201d67\nand that a key part of any legitimate claim to political\ncontrol over that territory is the idea that \u201ca people with\ndeep roots and a historical attachment to the land have a\nright to control it.\u201d68\nWhereas this \u201chomeland principle\u201d was formulated by\nSmith and Toft in relation to nationalism rather than assim-\nilation, it goes a long way towards explaining the Ugan-\ndan case study examined here. Inasmuch as Buyaga and\nBugangaizi was the pre-colonial homeland of the Banyoro\npeople, its Banyoro residents would have been much less\ninterested in assimilating into Buganda as doing so would\nhave involved negating a core part of their ethnic identity.\nHowever, Banyoro residents in the other counties and in\nBuddu, let alone the Banyarwanda immigrants to Uganda\nmentioned above, did not have a strong ethnic attach-\nment to the land on which they lived and could therefore\nassimilate more easily, safe in the knowledge that their\nassimilation had not done any serious damage to the future\nof their previous ethnic group. Thus this differing quality\nof attachment to territory and ethnic identity explains the\nvery different rates of assimilation during the colonial\nperiod, even though residents in all of the counties could\nhave been categorized as Banyoro at the onset of colonial\nrule.\nConclusion\nThis article has suggested that the presence or absence of a\npre-colonial homeland explains why the Ugandan colo-\nnial state failed to direct assimilation in Buyaga and Bugan-\ngaizi but succeeded in the other five lost counties. If, as\ndemonstrated in the introduction, we take the Ugandan\nand other African colonial states as \u201ccrucial case\u201d studies\nin the study of state-directed ethnic change, then we are\nleft with at least three implications as regards the relation-\nship between states and ethnic change. First, the evidence\npresented here suggests that ethnic identities, whether in\nAfrica or elsewhere, vary significantly in their intensity\nand that this variation can lead to varying outcomes when\nstates attempt to assimilate these groups. In contrast, in\nmany historical or contemporary studies of ethnicity and\nnationalism, there is often an unfortunate assumption that\nall ethnic and national identities are of the same order and\nintensity. This fault originated in the late nineteenth and\nearly twentieth century, when colonial rulers saw them-\nselves as belonging to one and only one nation and their\nsubjects as members of one and only one tribe, each of\nwhich was assumed to have the same intensity of attach-\nment. Today, while the constructivist turn has led to the\nunderstanding that people can and usually do hold mul-\ntiple ethnic identities, it is not yet clear that there has been\nenough attention given to the variation in the strength of\nthese identities at a given point in time. Indeed, rational\nchoice paradigms of ethnicity still assume the same inten-\nsity of identity for each group, a problem especially evi-\ndent in the creation of world-wide data sets of ethnic\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nArticles | Understanding the Limits to Ethnic Change\n480 Perspectives on Politics\ngroups where each person is either a member of an ethnic\ngroup or is not.69 What is evident in the story of the lost\ncounties is that, due to the overlapping nature of the Bun-\nyoro heartland and the Bunyoro state in the pre-colonial\nera, being Banyoro in Buddu and the eastern lost counties\nwas quite different from being Banyoro in Buyaga and\nBugangaizi, and that these differences had noticeable and\nprofound consequences. Any attempt to code ethnicity in\nearly colonial Uganda in a data set would have missed this\nvarying intensity and would have therefore been unable to\npredict the differing outcomes of the lost counties over\nthe course of the twentieth century.\nSecond, the Ugandan case suggests that even the stron-\ngest states are limited in their ability to effect ethnic change,\nand that this failure can have significant political out-\ncomes. Not only was the Ugandan state unable to pro-\nmote assimilation in Buyaga and Bugangaizi but, in the\nwords of Governor Crawford in 1959, \u201cif the problem of\nthe \u2018lost counties\u2019 is not settled before Uganda becomes\nself-governing it could easily lead to early disruption of\nthe new self-governing state, or even to civil war.\u201d70 In\neffect Crawford\u2019s prediction was correct, as the transfer of\nthe lost counties back to Bunyoro in the 1964 referendum\nled directly to the breakup of the two-party political coali-\ntion governing Uganda up to that point and indirectly to\nMilton Obote\u2019s palace coup d\u2019etat of 1966. Indeed, the\nfailure of the 1964 referendum to redistribute land own-\nership from absentee Baganda landlords to local Banyoro\nresidents has led more recently to brutal inter-ethnic clashes\nover land in the two lost counties and the deployment of\nriot police to contain the violence after elections in 2002\nand 2006;71 the claim among many Banyoro residents\nthat internal migrants from elsewhere in Uganda have no\nright to land in the counties is reminiscent of Toft\u2019s afore-\nmentioned argument about the link between indivisible\nterritory and conflict.72\nBoth the failure of the Ugandan state to promote assim-\nilation as well as the long-lasting political consequences of\nthis failure thus contradict the assertion that the African\ncolonial state was able to \u201cdelineate the strategic contexts\nin which ethnicity was or was not salient\u201d and thereby\n\u201cmould the choices of political actors with regard to both\nascriptive markers of ethnicity and the organizational forms\nin which it was expressed.\u201d73 Far from having the \u201cexcep-\ntional capacity . . . to impose its own images of society\u201d as\nregards ethnicity,74 the Protectorate state was unable to\novercome the strength of pre-colonial ethnic identities in\nthe lost counties. Certainly one lesson here would be that\nscholars attempting to account for ethnic change in the\nmodern world ignore the pre-modern world at their peril.\nIndeed, as demonstrated by Anthony Smith and his \u201ceth-\nnosymbolist\u201d school of nationalism studies, modern states\nhave had problems forging national identities without a\nsubstantial collection of pre-modern ethnic myths and\nmemories from which to draw upon.75\nOne could respond here by arguing that, because it was\na large pre-colonial state, Bunyoro is exceptional and thus\nthe case of lost counties does not add much to our more\ngeneral understanding of ethnic change. Yet one should\nnot forget that there were several other states just in the\npre-colonial Great Lakes region, including Burundi, Kooki,\nNkore, Rwanda, and Toro, whose pre-colonial political\nidentities led directly to both a modern ethnic identity\nand an ethnic homeland in the colonial era. While these\nstates may be exceptional in that they account for a minor-\nity of contemporary ethnic identities in the region, one\nwould be hard pressed to understand post-colonial con-\nflicts in the Great Lakes region without some understand-\ning of these pre-colonial states, as Pierre Englebert has\ndemonstrated elsewhere for Sub-Saharan Africa as a\nwhole.76\nThird and finally, the Ugandan case study suggests that\nassimilation policies may need to be reconceived. If the\ncolonial Ugandan state, with its great coercive power and\nfrail civil society, could not enforce assimilation in the lost\ncounties, where and when should we expect modern dem-\nocratic states, with much less coercive power over their\ncitizens and much more strongly organized civil societies,\nto promote assimilation successfully? Certainly the lesson\nhere is that the presence of an ethnic homeland can make\nassimilation that much more difficult, as seen with the\nvarious failed attempts at assimilating the native inhabit-\nants of Australia, Canada, and the United States, among\nothers. Indeed, as noted by various scholars, Native Amer-\nicans have both clung onto an identification with their\nown ethnic homelands while also resisting assimilation,77\nas have, in a more notorious fashion, the \u201cstolen genera-\ntions\u201d of aboriginal children in Australia who were forc-\nibly removed from their families and brought up as white\nAustralians up until 1969.78 The importance of an ethnic\nhomeland in resisting assimilation also arguably underlies\nthe recent attempt among American anti-immigration\nactivists to popularize what they call reconquista theory,\nwhere the ultimate goal of Mexican immigrants is to reclaim\ntheir own \u201clost\u201d territories in the south-western United\nStates.79 Despite the very dubious evidence behind this\ntheory, it is clear that belief in it is both genuine and based\nin part on a worry that Mexicans might claim part of the\nUnited States as their homeland and therefore refuse to\nassimilate. Certainly the Ugandan case study presented\nhere suggests that the presence of an ethnic homeland can\nsignificantly affect the success of assimilation policies\namongst ethnic minorities, while ethnic minorities who\ndo not live in what they consider to be their homeland\u2014\nwhether the Banyarwanda in colonial Uganda or contem-\nporary immigrants to the United States\u2014should be much\neasier to assimilate than those who do.\nIn the end the experience of the lost counties points to\nthe need to formulate a more coherent and exact theory\nof ethnic change in the modern world. The recent\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nSeptember 2008 | Vol. 6\/No. 3 481\nconstructivist advances made in the study of ethnicity\nhave helped us to understand better how, when, and why\nethnic identities change; what is also necessary is to under-\nstand where these identities do and do not change and\nthe underlying reasons for these differences. Hopefully\nthe Ugandan evidence presented here will move us fur-\nther along this path.\nNotes\n1 The theoretical argument examined here is merely\none variety of constructivism, which, more broadly\nspeaking, can be said to encompass the ideas that\nethnicity is multiple, fluid and endogenous to exter-\nnal phenomena.

These immigrants should be\ndistinguished from the Rwandan refugees who came\nto Uganda between 1959 and 1973; many of these\nrefugees stayed in refugee camps in south-west Uganda\nand largely failed to integrate into Ugandan soci-\nety. As a result many of them, unlike the immi-\ngrants, returned home with the RPF invasion of\n1990. See Mamdani 2001b, 162\u2013164; Newbury\n2005, 267\u2013270.\n50 For the sake of simplicity I leave out a discussion of\nBulemezi and Singo districts here, neither of which\nwas wholly part of Bunyoro in the pre-colonial era.\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nArticles | Understanding the Limits to Ethnic Change\n482 Perspectives on Politics\n51 Molson Commission, 8; Interview with Kibaale\nDistrict Secretary of Finance and Planning John\nBaptist Sentoogo Amooti, Kibaale, August 9, 2005.\n52 Buganda Annual Report for 1907\u201308 (Uganda\nNational Archives [henceforth UNA] A44\/255).\n53 Fortt 1954, 117.\n54 The 2002 Ugandan census was the first to ever\nrecord the Baruli as a recognized ethnic group.\n55 Interview with John Baptist Sentoogo Amooti.\n56 Interview with MP Margaret Komuhangi (Women,\nNakasongola), Kampala, November 27, 2001. Naka-\nsongola District Chairman Christopher Bagonza\nsimilarly claimed that \u201cBuruli is neither in Buganda\nnor in Bunyoro but is independent\u201d ([Kampala]\nNew Vision, August 23, 2004).\n57 See also MP Daniel Kiwilabye (Kiboga East)\u2019s state-\nment to Parliament that \u201cthe people of Buwekula\n. . . are very happy and they have never made any\npetition anywhere; even during the constitutional\nmaking process\u201d (Proceedings of the Uganda Na-\ntional Assembly, 17 May 2005).\n58 One hundred Banyoro were reported to have fled\nBuyaga county between 1900 and 1902 as the\nBaganda chiefs were \u201ctreating them somewhat as\nserfs;\u201d see Roberts 1962, 197. However, it is just as\nlikely that Banyoro migrated to Bunyoro and\nToro at the time due to the relatively high poll taxes\nin Mubende district: in 1911 one British official\nnoted that \u201cthe population of Buyaga is naturally of\nan unstable and migratory character, . . . [and]\nuntil the tax in Toro and Unyoro is raised to Rs.5\nno real remedy for this state of affairs will be found.\u201d\nSee the Monthly Report for Mubende District, 7\nMarch 1911 (UNA A46\/662). As noted above, by\n1929 these taxes had been reduced to the same\nor lower than surrounding areas.\n59 Fortt 1954, 94\u201395, 112.\n60 Doyle 1998, 34; Ingham 1953, 139; Uzoigwe 1972,\n436.\n61 Doyle 2006, pp. 177\u2013179; Winyi 1948, 15; Ingham\n1953, 145; Munster Commission 1961, 89.\n62 Beattie 1971, 84.\n63 Wrigley 1996, 23, 219.
