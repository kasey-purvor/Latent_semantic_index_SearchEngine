The trees were 3 years old at the commencement of the study, and most \nspecies were competing strongly with crops. Tree roots were pruned 41 months after \nplanting by cutting and back-filling a trench to a depth of 0.3 m, at a distance of 0.3 m \nfrom the trees, on one side of the tree row. The trench was re-opened and roots re-cut \nat 50 and 62 months after planting. Effects on tree growth and root distribution were \nassessed over a 3 year period, and crop yield after the third root pruning at 62 months \nis reported here. Overall, root pruning had only a slight effect on tree growth: height \ngrowth was unaffected and diameter growth was reduced by only 4 %.  A substantial \namount of root re-growth was observed by 11 months after pruning. Tree species \nvaried in the number and distribution of their roots, and Casuarina and Markhamia \nhad considerably more roots per unit of trunk volume than the other tree species, \nespecially in the surface soil layers. Casuarina and Maesopsis were the most \ncompetitive tree species with crops and Grevillea and Markhamia the least. Crop \nyield data provides strong evidence of the redistribution of root activity following root \npruning, so that competition increased on the unpruned side of tree rows. Thus, one-\nsided root pruning will only be of use to farmers in a few circumstances. \nKey words: Alnus acuminata, Casuarina equisetifolia, Grevillea robusta, Maesopsis \neminii, Markhamia lutea, root distribution, root function \nIntroduction \n \nGrowing trees with crops in agroforestry systems can increase total productivity, \nreduce land degradation and improve recycling of nutrients, while producing fuel \nwood, fodder, fruits and timber in addition to products from annual crops (Sanchez \n1995). However, the potential benefits of higher productivity, improved sustainability \nand reduced risk of such simultaneous agroforestry systems in comparison with \nmonocultures are the outcome of a complex set of spatial and temporal interactions \nbetween the different components of the system. An important aspect of these \ninteractions is the increasing dominance of the perennial trees as they mature (Ong et \nal. 2004) and compete with crops for light, water and nutrients (Ong and Huxley \n1996).  \n \nTree roots extend to considerably greater distances and depths than crop roots (Stone \nand Kalisz 1991). However, most tree species, like crop plants, exhibit a rapid decline \nin root mass, number and length with increasing soil depth. Consequently, although \ntree roots explore a far greater volume of soil, this volume includes the surface layers \nof soil where crop roots are also located, and thus there is the potential for both \ncomplementarity and competition in the use of below-ground resources (Schroth \n1999), depending on the location and activity of the tree root system relative to the \ncrop roots.  \n \nThe management of below-ground interactions is most important in systems where \ntrees and crops are grown in close proximity with the objective of producing multiple \nproducts, and where soil resources (water, nutrients) are limiting, as in seasonally dry \nclimates, the semi-arid tropics and on infertile soils (Rao et al. 2004). Reducing \nbelow-ground competition may be achieved by selecting trees with less competitive \nroot architecture, i.e. deep rooted trees with few roots in the upper soil layers, or by \ncontrolling tree roots in these upper layers by management (Rao et al. 2004; Schroth \n1995). However, rooting behavior depends on many factors including site, tree age, \nprovenance and method of propagation (Mulatya et al. 2002), and assessments of \ncompetition obtained under one set of circumstances may not be applicable elsewhere. \nFurthermore, even deep-rooted trees have some roots in the crop-rooting zone \n(Akinnifesi et al. 2004), and evidence that root activity shifts between deep and \nsuperficial soil layers with changes in soil moisture, suggests that selection of deep \nrooting species may only provide a limited solution to the problem (Green et al. 1997; \nOng et al. 2002).  \n \nTree management, rather than species selection, is attractive because it allows farmers \nto grow the tree species they want, rather than those with particular root architecture. \nStudies in the tropics have indicated that competition for below ground resources can \nbe reduced by root pruning of trees and results have been encouraging in both semi-\narid environments and wetland rice (Corlett et al. 1992; Hocking and Islam 1997; \nKorwar and Radder 1994; Singh et al. 1989).  However, short-term benefits may not \nbe sustained, and there is a lack of quantitative information of the effects on tree \ngrowth. This study examines the effects of root pruning on one side of tree rows on \nabove and below ground growth of a range of indigenous and exotic tree species in \nUganda, and the impact of this root pruning on the growth of adjacent crops. The root \npruning method was designed to be compatible with farmers\u2019 traditional manual \nmethods of land preparation.  \n Materials and methods \n \nThe study used a trial which had been planted in September 1995 (Okorio 2000) at \nKifu Forest Research Station (0\u00b0 21\u2019 N, 32\u00b0 46\u2019 E, at 1250 m above sea-level) in \nMukono district of Central Uganda, approximately 30 km east of Kampala. Rainfall at \nKifu is bimodal, with a mean annual rainfall of about 1240 mm. Mean minimum and \nmaximum annual temperatures are 21 and 25.3 \u00b0C respectively.  Rainfall occurs with \nhighest frequency from March \u2013 May and October \u2013 November. However, \nthunderstorms during the intervening relatively \u2018dry\u2019 periods ensure that monthly \nrainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year (NEMA 1996). The soil, a \nferralsol (FAO-UNESCO 1974), is a sandy loam, which averages 14% clay, 30% silt \nand 57% sand, with a pH 6.2 and 1.13% organic matter in the top 0 \u2013 0.45 m (Okorio \n2000). \n \nThe trial was set up as a linear simultaneous agroforestry system, with separate, \nreplicated, plots of five tree species (Alnus acuminata (HB & K), Casuarina \nequisetifolia (L), Grevillea robusta (A. Cunn. ex R. Br), Maesopsis eminii (Engl.), \nMarkhamia lutea (Benth.) K. Schum.), and \u2018no tree\u2019 controls. The two latter tree \nspecies are indigenous to Uganda and frequently planted by farmers, whereas the \nothers are exotics and undergoing evaluation in several studies. As most farms are \nsmall, tree-crop interactions will be inevitable in most circumstances. Seed origins are \nprovided in Table 1.  \n \nThe trees were planted when they were four months old, in a single row along the \ncentral short E-W axis of the 30 x 25 m plots at a spacing of 1 m between trees, \nmaking a total of 24 trees per plot (Figure 1). Plots were replicated 4 times in a \nrandomized block design, the layout of which was determined following soil analysis \nand assessment of the growth of a cover crop of maize (Wajja-Musukwe 2003). \nSeedlings which died were replaced during the first and second rainy seasons. By the \ntime of this study, trees were competing strongly with crops (Okorio 2000; Wajja-\nMusukwe 2003). Root pruning commenced in February 1999 (month 41) and \nalternate trees were removed during the following month, so that there was then 2 m \nbetween trees. Root pruning was imposed in a split-plot arrangement (Figure 1), \nwhereby the roots were pruned on one side of the tree row on half of each tree plot.  \nOne-sided root pruning was adopted to simulate that which might be used on \nboundary trees. Root pruning was done by digging a trench 0.3 x 0.3 m in width and \ndepth on one side and 0.3 m away from the tree line, using mattocks and machetes. \nAll roots were severed and the trench was then back-filled. The site has a gentle 5% \nslope, and in two of the blocks the pruning was done on the up-slope (northerly side) \nwhile the other two blocks were pruned on the southerly side. Root pruning was \nrepeated at 50 and 62 months after planting.  \n \nAnnual intercrops were planted in rotation (Zea mays, variety Longe 1 - maize and \nPhaseolus vulgaris variety K132 - beans) in the first (long) rains and second (short) \nbimodal rains respectively and yields were assessed each season. Plots were prepared \nbefore the onset of the rains by deep cultivation using hand hoes, and plots were \nweeded twice each season by hoe. A basal application of single super phosphate (298 \nkg ha-1) was applied before each sowing, and an additional application of NPK (25-5-\n5)(149 kg ha-1) was made before maize was sown. Trenches were also dug between \nplots and between subplots, to reduce the crossover of roots between treatments. \nFollowing local practice, before every cropping season, the lower branches of all trees \nwere removed to raise the crowns to reduce shade, i.e. the lower one-third of the tree \nstem was maintained branch-free.  Bean seed was hand sown in rows 0.5 m apart, \nrunning parallel to the tree row. After germination, bean plants were thinned to 0.1 m \napart within rows, with the first row planted 0.5 m from the tree row. Maize rows \nwere 0.75 m apart, with 0.3 m between plants in a row. In this paper, the yield (air-dry \nweight of seeds) of beans, planted in November 2000, just after the third root pruning, \nand harvested in January 2001 is reported. Calculations of sub-plot yield excluded the \noutermost two rows, and were determined from 28 rows of beans, extending up to 14 \nm from the tree row.  \n \nThe effect of root pruning on root regrowth and the overall distribution and number of \nroots on the plots was determined. Direct observations of the original root pruning \ntrenches were made twice, 4 and 11 months after the third root pruning. For this, three \ncentral trees were selected in the tree row, and a 6 m long x 0.15 m wide x 0.3 m deep \ntrench was dug 0.15 m away from and parallel to the original trench created by root \npruning. From this new trench, soil was carefully removed back towards the original \ntrench, using various hand tools. The roots were carefully exposed back to the point \nwhere the main roots had been severed at the time of pruning and to the depth of the \noriginal pruning. New roots which proliferated at the original severance points were \ntermed \u2018coppice roots\u2019.  Main and coppice roots were counted and their diameters \nmeasured using calipers. Main roots were >5 mm diameter at the time of the \nassessments and had been pruned. Coppice roots were roots which had re-grown from \nthe main roots. Because of the laborious nature of this work, plots of each tree species \nwere only examined in two of the blocks. \n \nTwelve months after the third root pruning, profile walls (Schuurman and \nGoedewaagen 1971) were used to examine root distribution through the soil profile at \n1.5 and 6 m from the tree row. For this, a single plot for each tree species was \nrandomly selected from blocks 1 and 2, which had deeper soils (\u2265 2 m deep) than \nblocks 3 and 4. Then vertical-sided trenches were dug parallel to the tree line in the \nroot-pruned sub plot on both the TP+ and TP- sides (Figure 1b). Thus selected sub \nplots had four trenches (two each on side TP+ and TP-), with a depth of 2 m, a 2 m \nlong face parallel to the tree row and a width of 1 m. For assessment, a wooden grid \nsubdivided into 0.1 x 0.1 m cells was placed against the 2 x 2 m side proximal to the \ntree row and the roots in each cell were counted and their diameters measured. Data \nwere collected from a width of 1.5 m and depth of 1.8 m for each profile wall, and the \ntotal number of roots and the total root cross-sectional area at each soil depth (0 \u2013 0.3, \n0.3 \u2013 0.6 m etc) were determined. Roots counted and measured on the profile walls \nwere divided into size categories for analysis (<2, 2 \u2013 4.9, 5 \u2013 9.9, 10 \u2013 49.9, and \u2265 50 \nmm diameter). Ratios of root number: trunk volume were calculated using root counts \nfrom the profile walls cut at 1.5 m from the tree rows and the mean tree volume for \nthe adjacent tree row. \n \nTree height and diameter at breast height (dbh) and crown diameter, were measured at \nregular intervals after planting. Leaf area was determined allometrically from weighing \nand scanning sub samples of leaves collected from branches of different cross-sectional \nareas (Wajja-Musukwe 2003).  \n Data analysis \nDifferences between treatment means were determined by analysis of variance \n(ANOVA) using Genstat (Lawes Agricultural Trust 1998). Data were checked for \nheterogeneity of variances using Bartlett\u2019s test, and square-root transformed if \nnecessary. Significant differences between treatment means were assumed and least \nsignificant differences (LSDs) calculated when p \u2264 0.05 in Fisher\u2019s F test. For tree \ngrowth (dbh and height), ANOVAs used a split-plot approach to test for the effects of \ntree species and pruning treatments (TP vs. TP0, Figure 1a) and interactions between \nspecies and pruning, using repeated measures for assessments at different times. \nBecause tree measurements shortly after the first pruning at 43 months indicated that \nthere was an unexpected (though non-significant) tendency for the root-pruned cohort \nof trees to be smaller than the unpruned cohort, the effects of pruning on height and \ndbh growth over the time series were assessed using the measurements collected at 43 \nmonths after planting (2 months after pruning), as a covariate in the analysis. The \nrepeated measures with covariate analysis indicated that Box\u2019s test for the symmetry \nof the covariance ratio for both height and diameter was significant; consequently \ndegrees of freedom were adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon before \nsignificances were calculated. \n \nANOVA of root re-growth in the pruning trenches evaluated differences between \nspecies, but replication was low.  However, for the profile walls, since they were not \nreplicated within species, analysis of root distribution across the plots was not \npossible at the species level. Profile wall data were analyzed using a split-plot \nANOVA approach in the TP+ and TP- sub plots (Figure 1b) to examine the effects of \npruning treatment, distance and depth, recognizing that no statistical comparisons of \nspecies differences were possible.  \n \nFor crop yield, the effects of tree species and pruning treatment were analyzed at the \nsub plot level, comparing yield in the TP+, TP- and TP0 sub plots (Figure 1b), using \ndata for the first 28 rows of beans, extending 14 m from the tree row.  As effects of \ntrees on crop yield were strongest close to trees (Wajja-Musukwe 2003), these data \nwere subsequently sub-divided into proximal (0 \u2013 7 m) and distal (7 \u2013 14 m) \ncomponents, containing rows 1 \u2013 14 and 15 \u2013 28 respectively.  Finally, combined \nyields from both sides of the pruned tree rows (TP+ + TP-) were compared with yields \nadjacent to unpruned trees (TP0), with correction for the difference in plot area. \n \nResults \nTree growth \n \nTree growth since planting is shown in Figure 2. Tree species grew at different rates, \nbut there were no significant effects of pruning on height, however, a significant root \npruning * time interaction (p = 0.006) on tree dbh was present, so that pruning began \nto have a significant effect on tree dbh by 9 months after pruning (Table 2). Overall, \neffects of one- sided root pruning on tree growth were very slight. \n \nWhile Alnus grew slowly throughout the study, other species changed their rankings \nover time (Figure 2). Casuarina and Grevillea were jointly the best in terms of height \ngrowth for the first 30 months, after which the growth of Grevillea slowed.  \nCasuarina continued to be the tallest species for the remainder of the study. Grevillea \nranked first in terms of dbh for the first 30 months, but was then succeeded by \nMaesopsis.  Maesopsis generally appeared slow to establish but over the time frame \nof the whole study proved its worth as a fast growing timber species. Six years after \nplanting, Casuarina trees were 18 m in height, while Alnus were 7 m. Maesopsis \nreached 22 cm in dbh, while Alnus only achieved 11 cm. Impacts of thinning on tree \nheight growth were not discernible, however, dbh appeared to respond to thinning \nafter a lag of about 8 months. \n \n \nRoot re-growth \nFour months after root pruning, roots of all species had regrown into the reopened \nroot pruning trench (Table 3). There were no significant differences between species \nin the number or dimensions of these coppice roots. However, there were significant \ndifferences between species in the mean number of main roots found in the trench: \nGrevillea had the most main roots per tree, and Casuarina, Maesopsis and Alnus the \nfewest.  \n \nEleven months after root pruning, some of the main roots of Grevillea and \nMarkhamia had died. The number of main roots of Alnus had increased since the \nobservations seven months previously due to expansion of pruned roots which had \npreviously been below the 5 mm diameter threshold for main roots. Unlike the other \ntree species, the mean diameter of Alnus main roots did not increase between the two \nsets of observations, reflecting the recruitment of roots into this size class. However, \ncross sectional areas of main roots had increased since the previous assessment, and \ndifferences in root regrowth between species were becoming more distinct: Grevillea \nshowed only a slight increase in root regrowth from the previous occasion, while \nAlnus coppice root numbers had increased four-fold.  The cross-sectional area of \ncoppice roots increased considerably between the two assessments. \n \nMain and regrowth coppice root diameters were significantly positively correlated. \nCoppice roots of Casuarina, Maesopsis and Markhamia grew fairly horizontally in \nthe top soil while those of Grevillea and Alnus tended to grow downwards ((Wajja-\nMusukwe 2003). \n \nRoot distribution \nIn the profile walls, root numbers decreased with increasing depth in the soil profile \nand with distance from tree (Figure 3), as expected.  Fine roots < 2mm in diameter, \naccounted for approximately half the roots. Analysis of these data, collected 12 \nmonths after the last pruning, and shortly after the 11 month assessment of root \nregrowth in the pruning trenches, showed that pruning significantly reduced (p = \n0.005) the numbers of roots in the \u2265 50 mm diameter size class, but not in the other \nclasses. Numbers of roots in all size classes decreased significantly (p \u2264 0.05) with \nboth distance from trees and increasing depth in the profile, and distance x depth \neffects occurred with roots in all classes > 5 mm diameter. Pruning x depth effects \nwere significant only in the \u2265 50 mm diameter size class (p = 0.037), where there \nwere significantly fewer roots of this class in the upper soil layers, on the pruned side \nof the trees at 0 \u2013 0.3 and 0.3 \u2013 0.6 m below ground level. However, mean numbers of \nroots in this size class were very small, with 2 and 5.3 roots respectively per m2 on the \npruned and unpruned side of the tree in the top 0.3 m of soil when the two distances \nwere combined. \n When total cross sectional area of roots in the different size classes was determined, \npruning effects were again seen in the large diameter classes: significant pruning x \ndepth interactions (p < 0.02) and main effects of pruning (p < 0.03) occurred in 10 \u2013 \n49.9 and \u2265 50 mm classes. In both these classes, root cross-sectional area was smaller \nin pruned trees at 0 \u2013 0.3 m depth.  Significant main effects of distance and depth \noccurred in all size classes. \n  \nNumbers of roots varied considerably between tree species. Although analysis of \nthese data is restricted by the lack of replication, contour plots of data collected from \nthe profile walls at 1.5 m from the trees on the pruned and unpruned sides of the tree \nrows highlight the differences present (Figures 4 & 5).  Grevillea had consistently less \nroots than the other tree species. The Maesopsis unpruned profile contained up to 50 \nroots m-2, whereas the pruned profile contained < 15 roots m-2 Casuarina had up to 50 \nroots m-2 in the pruned profile, but fewer in the unpruned profile. Combining data \nfrom the pruned and unpruned profiles, root numbers of Grevillea < Alnus < \nMarkhamia < Maesopsis < Casuarina. The Maesopsis profile showed maximum \nroots at about 0.45 m below the soil surface, whereas roots of other species were most \nnumerous closer to the soil surface. Alnus roots were not found at 6 m from the trees \n(data not shown), whereas roots of all other species were present at 6 m, though those \nof Grevillea were not numerous. \n \nTrunk volumes varied considerably between species. When calculated as the volume \nof a cone from tree height and dbh, values of 0.021, 0.057, 0.076, 0.135 and 0.163 m3 \nwere obtained for Alnus, Markhamia, Casuarina, Grevillea and Maesopsis \nrespectively. The number of roots per unit of trunk volume varied considerably \nbetween species throughout the soil profile (Figure 6). There was a 10 fold difference \nbetween the lowest (Grevillea) and highest (Casuarina) ratios in the top 0.3 m of soil. \nCasuarina and Markhamia had far larger numbers of roots in relation to their trunk \nvolume than other species through most of the measured soil profile. \n \nCrop yield \n \nIn the 28-row sub plots  (TP+, TP- and TP0),  there was no significant interaction \nbetween tree species and pruning treatment, and no significant differences between \nthe pruning treatments. However, there was a significant main effect of tree species \n(Table 4): crop yield was significantly reduced with Casuarina and Maesopsis \ncompared to the \u2018no tree\u2019 control, while yields with Grevillea, Markhamia and Alnus \nwere not significantly different to the control. Analysis of the 0 \u2013 7 m (proximal) and \n7 \u2013 14 m (distal) sub units, showed that crop yields were significantly reduced by all \ntree species relative to the \u2018no tree\u2019 control in the proximal unit but not in the distal \nunit. The effects of pruning treatment on crop yield were also significant in the \nproximal unit, with TP+ > TP0 > TP- (Table 4).  \n \nAs yields from the TP0 proximal sub plots were intermediate between those of the \nTP+ and TP- treatments (Table 4), crop yields on both sides of the pruned tree row \nwere combined, and the yield from (TP+ + TP-)\/2 was compared with TP0 (Table 5). \nWhen plots were combined in this way, there was no effect of pruning on crop yield, \neither in the full sub plot or its proximal unit. \n \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \n \nAbove ground tree growth \nThere were considerable differences between the growth rates and form of the five \ntree species in this study.  In terms of height growth, the results are consistent with \nthose of previous Ugandan studies by Okorio et al. (1994) who found that Maesopsis \nand Casuarina were faster growing than Markhamia and Alnus. Although Alnus \nperformed poorly at this location, it grows faster at higher altitudes elsewhere in \nUganda (Sande 2003) \n \nEffect of root pruning on above-ground tree growth \nRoot pruning significantly reduced trunk diameter growth in all species. The effect \nincreased, over time with the ratio of pruned to unpruned tree diameter declining from \n0.98 at 6 months, to 0.96 at 28 months after first root pruning. While there was also a \ntendency for pruned trees to be shorter, this difference was not significant, possibly \ndue to the difficulties of measuring tall trees with graduated poles. There was no \nevidence of tree mortality or wind throw as a result of root pruning.  \n \nOther studies of the use of root pruning or root barriers to control competition have \nalso  reported reductions in tree growth, however comparisons between studies are \ndifficult, not only because of environmental and species differences, but also because \nof the wide variety of approaches to root pruning. Sudmeyer et al. (2002) found no \neffect on tree growth when root pruning was done to a depth of 0.4 \u2013 0.7 m at about 5 \nm from one side of a Pinus pinaster windbreak, although other studies (Sudmeyer and \nFlugge 2005) showed that root pruning and root barriers on both sides of tree rows \nreduced the growth of Pinus and Eucalyptus spp. by 14 \u2013 43%. Jose et al. (2000) \nreported that black walnut (Juglans nigra) stem diameter growth in \u2018trench\u2019 and \n\u2018barrier\u2019 treatments was significantly less than in a \u2018no barrier\u2019 treatment, but they \npruned on both sides of the tree line to a depth of 1.2 m. Likewise, Miller and Pallardy \n(2001) reported reduced stem growth of Acer saccharinum trees after trenching to a \ndepth of 1 m.  Hocking and Islam (1997)  reported a 19 % reduction in stem girth due \nto a combined effect of top and root pruning to a depth of 0.3 m in Bangladesh over a \nfive year period.  \n \nRoot pruning did not affect crown diameter (Wajja-Musukwe 2003). Crown diameter \nincreased in size until about 60 months after planting. Maesopsis crowns were widest \nand Markhamia were narrowest at 7 and 3.5 m diameter, respectively. Leaf area \nassessments at the end of the study showed that Maesopsis also had the greatest leaf \narea (600 m2 per tree) and Alnus had the smallest (70 m2). \n \nBelow-ground tree growth \nThe general pattern of decline in tree root numbers with distance from tree and depth \n(Figure 3) is consistent with that described in many other studies (e.g. Akinnifesi et al. \n2004; Sudmeyer et al. 2004). The data confirm that tree roots are most numerous in \nthe crop rooting zone (Odhiambo et al. 2001). However, the combined results \npresented in Figure 3, mask considerable differences between species in both number \nof roots and their distribution down the soil profile (Figures 4, 5). The reduction in \nnumber of the largest tree roots by pruning (> 50 mm diameter) might limit the \noverall lateral spread of the tree root system and tend to focus competition nearer the \ntrees. Root number was not simply related to above ground tree biomass (Figure 6). \nOn the deep soil at Kifu, Grevillea and Maesopsis appear to have root architectures \nmore compatible with crops than the other species, although this assumption is not \nconsistent with the crop data which was obtained: while Grevillea was not \ncompetitive, Maesopsis was, and above-ground competition by its widely spreading \ncanopy may have been an important contributory factor. Previous studies of Grevillea \nhave shown it to be variable in its root architecture (Howard et al. 1997; Odhiambo et \nal. 2001; Smith et al. 1999), which highlights the importance of individual site \nstudies. \n \nThe profile wall data only indicate laterally spreading roots. Root excavations \nreported elsewhere found that Casuarina, Maesopsis and Markhamia also had strong \ntap roots and that those of Maesopsis were of similar diameter to the tree dbh (Wajja-\nMusukwe 2003).  \nIn the pruning trenches, some of the main roots of Grevillea, Markhamia and \nMaesopsis died, as did some of the coppice roots of Maesopsis. No assessments were \nmade of unpruned trees, so this cannot be firmly attributed to the pruning. \n \nTaking the data from the unpruned side of the tree as a guide (Figure 3), root pruning \nwill have severed about 18% of the tree roots, yet all tree species had a high capacity \nfor root regrowth and long-term effects on stem growth were slight. The increasing \npresence of coppice roots in the pruning trenches over the period from 4 - 11 months \nafter root pruning indicates the need to determine appropriate pruning frequencies to \ncontrol competition with crops, and the species variation in angle of descent of the \ncoppice roots requires further investigation as it has implications for future \ncompetition with crops. \n \nCrop yield \nAs this crop was planted immediately after the third root pruning, effects of root \npruning would be expected to be strong as the number of active tree roots in the crop \nrooting zone should have been minimized.  \n \nCompetition was strongest close to trees and all species reduced yields in the 0 \u2013 7 m \nproximal sub unit. However, at the full sub plot level, from 0 \u2013 14 m from the tree \nrows, only 2 species, Casuarina and Maesopsis significantly reduced crop yields (Table \n4), reflecting the observations that Casuarina was the tallest species and Maesopsis had \nthe greatest dbh (Figure 1). However, the magnitude of the competitive effect is not \nsimply due to tree size, as Grevillea, which was one of the larger species, was the least \ncompetitive species at the full and proximal subplot levels. Root number: trunk volume \nratios were also not a good indicator of competition as, while competitive Casuarina \nhad the highest ratio, Maesopsis had a low ratio.  \n \nAlthough the effect of pruning was significant in the proximal sub unit (Table 4), \ncombining crop yield data from both sides of the pruned tree rows (Table 5), eliminated \nthe pruning effect, indicating that reduced root activity on the pruned side was \ncompensated for by increased root activity by the same trees on the unpruned side. This \ncompensatory root activity, not only removed the possible benefits of root pruning, but \nalso was probably responsible for the relatively small effects of root pruning on tree \ngrowth. \n \nWhile root pruning allows farmers to control competition with crops, this study \nhighlights the importance of tree species selection. Maesopsis trees had the largest \ntrunk volume, but were the most competitive species with crops, whereas Grevillea \nhad the second largest trunk volume, and did not reduce crop yields at this site. \n \nThis study was designed to assess the effects of root pruning in boundary plantings. \nWhile one-sided root pruning to control competition would be justified and effective \nwhere trees are grown adjacent to uncropped land, such as roads, when production on \nland on both sides of the trees is considered, one-sided pruning has no effects on crop \nyields. In eastern Africa, tree planting on boundaries is particularly prevalent in \nbimodal rainfall zones (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi), as a means of claiming \nland and asserting rights of exclusion (Warner 1993). In this situation, when adjacent \nlands are in different ownership, the actions of one farmer to reduce competition \nwould be detrimental to the yields of the adjacent farmer.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis study would not have been possible without the support of the Director of the \nForestry Resources Research Institute at Kifu, where the experiment was conducted. \nThe late David Wafula was deeply involved in the management of the field trial and \ndata collection, together with Robert Kiiza, Twaha Makubuya and Ramazan Matovu. \nT-N W-M was supported by a fellowship from the United States Agency for \nInternational Development under the Conservation of Bio-diversity Strategic \nObjective 2.

Means between treatments at \na particular time of measurement are significantly different when they are succeeded \nby different letters. \nMonths \nafter \nplanting \n47 50 56 60 63 66 69 \nDiameter at breast height (cm) \nPruned \ntrees \n10.28a 12.25b 13.07b 13.57b 14.04b 14.45b 15.30b \nUnpruned \ntrees \n10.45a 12.57a 13.47a 14.04a 14.61a 15.02a 15.95a \nHeight (m) \nPruned \ntrees \n  10.71a 11.59a 12.12a 12.45a 12.90a \nUnpruned \ntrees \n  10.86a 11.79a 12.39a 12.77a 13.18a \nData analyzed by repeated measures, using data collected at 43 months as a covariate \nin the analysis.
