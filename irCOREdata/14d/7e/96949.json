Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 61\n1. Introduction and background biology\nDevelopment of spatial pattern and form is one of the central issues in embryology and is included\nunder the general name of morphogenesis. Pattern generation models are grouped together as\nmorphogenetic models. These models provide the embryologist with possible scenarios as to how, and\noften when, pattern is laid down and how the embryonic form might be created. Although genes\ncontrol pattern formation genetics says nothing about the actual mechanisms involved nor how the vast\nrange of pattern and form that we see evolves from a homogeneous mass of dividing cells.\nBroadly speaking the two prevailing views of pattern generation that have dominated the thinking of\nembryologists in the past few years are the long standing Turing (1952) chemical pre-pattern approach\nand the more recent mechanochemical approach developed by G.F. Oster and J.D. Murray and their\ncolleagues [for example, Murray et al. 1983, Oster et al. 1983, Murray and Oster 1984a, b, Oster et al.\n1985]. General descriptions have been given by Murray and Maini [1986]and Oster and Murray [1988].\nTuring\u2019s theory [1952]of morphogenesis involves hypothetical chemicals, morphogens, which react\nand diffuse in such a way that if the kinetics have certain properties and the diffusion coefficients of the\nchemicals are not all the same then steady state heterogeneous spatial patterns in chemical concen-\ntrations can evolve from initial random perturbations about homogeneous steady states. Morphogenesis\nthen proceeds by the cells reacting to the chemical prepattern and differentiating according to some\nbauplan [Wolpert 1969, 1981]. Turing\u2019s theory has stimulated a large amount of research, both\ntheoretical and experimental. Such reaction diffusion models have been widely studied and applied to a\nvariety of biological problems: see, for example [Murray 1977, 1981, Meinhardt 1982] and the book by\nMurray [1988]. The books by Fife [1979], Smoller [1983] and Britton [1986] give mathematical\ntreatments of reaction diffusion systems. The dramatic Belousov\u2014Zhabotinskii reaction is the best\nknown reaction which will generate steady state concentration patterns. The book of articles edited by\nField and Burger [1985] gives a good overview of this fascinating reaction.\nIn this paper we shall describe the comparatively new Oster\u2014Murray mechanochemical approach,\nwhich directly brings forces and known properties of biological tissue into the process of morphogenetic\npattern formation, and apply it to several specific developmental problems of current widespread\ninterest in embryology.\nThe two approaches are basically quite different. In the chemical prepattern approach, pattern\nformation and morphogenesis takes place sequentially. First the chemical concentration pattern is\nformed, then the cells \u201cread out\u201d this pattern and the various cell differentiations, cell movement, and\nso on, follow from the chemical blueprint. So, in this approach morphogenesis is essentially a slave\nprocess which is determined once the chemical pattern has been established. Mechanical shaping of\nform which occurs during embryogenesis is not addressed in the chemical theory of morphogenesis. The\ncontinuing elusiveness of the chemical morphogens is also proving a considerable drawback in the\nacceptance of such a theory of morphogenesis. There is, however, no question but that chemicals play\nimportant roles in embryogenesis.\nIn the mechanochemical approach, pattern formation and morphogenesis is considered to go on\nsimultaneously as a single process. An important aspect of this approach is that the models associated\nwith it are formulated in terms of measurable quantities such as cell densities, forces, tissue deformation\nand so on. This focuses attention on the morphogenetic process itself and is more amenable to\nexperimental investigation. The principal use of any theory is in its predictions and, even though each\ntheory might be able to create similar patterns, they are mainly distinguished by the different\nexperiments they suggest.\n62 J.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation\nA telling point in favour of simultaneous development is that such mechanisms have the potential for\nself-correction. Embryonic development is usually a very stable process with the embryo capable of\nadjusting to many outside disturbances. The process whereby a prepattern exists and then mor-\nphogenesis takes place is effectively an open loop system. These are potentially unstable processes and\nmake it difficult for the embryo to make the necessary corrective adjustments as development proceeds.\nHere we shall discuss morphogenetic processes which involve coordinated movement or patterning of\npopulations of cells. The two types of early embryonic cells we shall be concerned with are fibroblast, or\ndermal or mesenchymal, cells and epidermal, or epithelial, cells. Fibroblast cells are capable of\nindependent movement, due to long finger-like protrusions called filopodia or lamellapodia which grab\nonto adhesive sites on a tissue or external substratum and pull themselves along: spatial aggregation\npatterns in these appear as spatial variations in cell number density. Epidermal cells, on the other hand,\nin general do not move but are packed together in sheets and spatial patterns in their population are\nmanifested by cell deformations. A notable exception is in the process of wound healing which is one of\nthe applications we discuss in Section 6.\nWe first consider mesenchymal (fibroblast) cell pattern formation in early embryogenesis. In animal\ndevelopment the basic body plan is more or less laid down in the first few weeks. It is during this crucial\nearly period that we expect pattern and form generating mechanisms, such as we propose here, to be\noperative. All of the models we describe are firmly based on macroscopic experimentally measurable\nvariables and on generally accepted properties of embryonic cells.\nIn the following section we show how the models are derived and how a variety of effects can be\nincorporated if indicated from subsequent experiments. We should perhaps add here that these models\npose numerous unsolved mathematical, both analytical and numerical, and biological modelling\nproblems.\n2. Mechanical models for mesenchymal morphogenesis\nSeveral factors affect the movement of embryonic cells within a tissue substratum which is made up\nof extracellular matrix (ECM). For example, (i) convection, where cells may move passively on the\nECM, due to the forces exerted on the ECM by other cells; (ii) contact guidance, in which the\nsubstratum on which cells crawl suggests a preferred direction; (iii) contact inhibition by cells, whereby\na high density of neighbouring cells inhibits motion; (iv) haptotaxis, which we describe below, where\nthe cells move up an adhesive gradient; (v) diffusion, where the cells move randomly but generally\ndown a cell density gradient; (vi) galvanotaxis, where movement from the field generated by electric\npotentials, which are known to exist in embryos, provides a preferred direction of motion; (vii)\nchemotaxis, whereby a chemical gradient can direct cell motion both up and down a concentration\ngradient. These effects are all well documented from experiment.\nThe model field equations encapsulate the key features which affect cell movement within its\nextracellular environment. We shall not include all of the effects just mentioned but it will be clear how\nthey can be incorporated and their effect quantified. The subsequent analysis of the field equations will\nshow how regular patterned aggregates of cells come about. In sections 4 and 5 we shall describe two\nreal applications of the model, namely to the highly organised patterns on skin such as the primordia\nwhich become feathers and scales, and the condensation of cells which presage the cartilage pattern in\ndeveloping limbs.\nJ. D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 63\nThe basic mechanical model hinges on two key experimentally determined properties of mesenchy-\nmat cells in vitro: (i) cells migrate within a tissue substratum made up of fibrous extracellular matrix,\nthe ECM, and other cells; (ii) cells can generate large traction forces [Harris et al. 1981]. The basic\nmechanism models the mechanical interaction between the motile cells and the viscoelastic substratum,\nwithin which they move.\nMesenchymal cells move by exerting forces on their surroundings, consisting of the viscoelastic\nfibrous ECM and the surface of other cells. They use their cellular protrusions, the filopodia or\nlamellapodia, which stretch out from the cell in all directions, to grip whatever is available and pull. As\nthe cells move through the ECM they deform it by virtue of their traction forces. These deformations in\nthe ECM induce anisotropy effects which in turn affect the cell motion. Analysis of models incorporat-\ning these various effects show that coordination of such effects result in spatially organised cell\naggregations. The basic model is essentially that proposed by Murray et al. [1983], Murray and Oster\n[1984a,b], with a detailed biological description by Oster et al. [1983].\nThe model, a continuum one, consists of three equations governing (i) the equation for the cell\npopulation density, (ii) the mechanical balance of the forces between the cells and the ECM and (iii)\nthe conservation law governing the ECM. Let n(r, t) and p(r, t) denote respectively the cell density (the\nnumber of cells per unit volume) and ECM density at position r and time t. Denote by u(r, t) the\ndisplacement vector of the ECM, that is, a material point in the matrix initially at position r undergoes\na displacement to r + u. We derive forms for each of these equations in turn.\n2.1. Cell equation\nThis takes the general form\n\u00f4nI\u00f4t=\u2014V.J+M, (1)\nwhere J is the flux of cells, that is, the number crossing a unit area in unit time, and M is the mitotic or\ncell proliferation rate. For simplicity we shall take a logistic form for the cell growth, namely rn(N \u2014 n)\nwhere r is the linear proliferative rate and N is the maximum cell density in the absence of any other\neffects. We include in I some of the factors mentioned above which affect cell motion.\nConvection. With u(r, t) the displacement vector of the ECM the convective flux contribution J~is\nJ~\u2014n\u00f4u\/\u00f4t. (2)\nHere the velocity of deformation of the matrix is \u00f4uIdt and the amount of cells transported is simply n\ntimes this velocity.\nRandom dispersal. Cells tend to disperse randomly when in a homogeneous isotropic medium.\nClassical diffusion contributes a flux term \u2014 D1Vn, which models the random motion in which the cells\nrespond to local variations in the cell density and tend to move down the density gradient. This results\nin the usual diffusion contribution D1V\n2n to the cell equation and represents local, or short range\nrandom motion.\nIn developing embryos the cell densities are relatively high and classical diffusion, which applies to\ndilute systems is not, perhaps, sufficiently accurate. The long filopodia extended by the cells can sense\ndensity variations beyond their nearest neighbours and so we must include a nonlocal effect on diffusive\ndispersal since the cells sense more distant densities. The appropriate form of the diffusion contribution\n64 J.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation\ncan be derived from a Landau\u2014Ginsberg approach [see Cohen and Murray 1981]. The flux of cells in\nthis situation is modelled by\n= \u2014D1Vn + D2V(V\n2n), (3)\nwhere D\n1 >0 is the usual Fickian diffusion coefficient and D2 >0 is the long range diffusion coefficient.\nThe long range contribution gives rise to a biharmonic term in eq. (1) and has a stabilising effect if\nD2 >0. We can see this immediately if we consider the long range diffusion equation, obtained by\nsubstituting eq. (3) into eq. (1) and omitting the mitotic term M, to get\n8n\/~t= \u2014VJd = D1V\n2n \u2014 D\n2V\n4n.\nIf we look for solutions of the form\nn(r, t)cx:exp[o.t+ikr],\nwhere k is the wavevector and substitute into the last equation we get the dispersion relation\no= \u2014D~k\u201d\u2014 D\n1k\n2<0\nfor all wavenumbers k(= kI). So n \u2014~ 0 as t\u2014~ ~ which implies n = 0 is stable. If the biharmonic term\nhad D\n2 <0, n = 0 would be unstable for wavenumbers k\n2> \u2014 D\n1 ID2. To account for contact guidance,\nthe diffusion coefficients may be functions of the strain tensor e(= ~[Vu+ VuT], where T denotes the\ntranspose). Here however we shall take them to be constants.\nHaptotaxis or Mechanotaxis. The traction exerted by the cells on the matrix generates gradients in\nthe matrix density p(r, t). We associate the density of matrix with the density of adhesive sites for the\ncell lamellapodia to get a hold of. Cells free to move in an adhesive gradient tend to move up it since\nthey can get a stronger grip on the denser matrix. This results in a net flux of cells up the gradient which\ngives the haptotactic flux as\nJh = anVp, (4)\nwhere a>0.\nThe cell equation (1), with the flux contributions to J from eqs. (2)\u2014(4) and a logistic form for the\nmitosis M, becomes\n9nI~t= \u2014V~(rn9uI~t)+ V [D1Vn\u2014 D2V(V\n2n)] (convection + diffusion)\n\u2014V (anVp) + rn(N \u2014 n) (haptotaxis + mitosis), (5)\nwhere D\n1, D2, a, r and N are positive parameters.\nWe have not included galvanotaxis and chemotaxis in eq. (5) but we can easily deduce what such a\ncontribution would look like. For example, if 4 is the electric potential then the galvanotactic flux can\nbe written as\nJg=gnV4i, (6a)\nJ.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 65\nwhere the parameter g >0. If cells responded to a chemoattractant c, chemotactic flux would be\nJchem = n~Vc, (6b)\nwhere x(c) is a function of the attractant. There are other refinements which could also be included; see\nfor example [Murray 1988].\nAlthough eq. (5) is clearly not the most general possible it suffices to show what can be expected in\nmore realistic model mechanisms for biological pattern generation.\nThe analysis of such models allows us to compare the various effects as to their pattern formation\npotential and hence to come up with the simplest realistic system which can generate pattern and which\nis experimentally testable.\n2.2. Cell\u2014matrix mechanical interaction equation\nThe composition of the fibrous extracellular matrix, the ECM, within which the cells move is complex\nand moreover, its constituents change as development proceeds. Here we are interested in the\nmechanical interaction between the cells and the matrix. As the mechanical deformations are small a\nreasonable first approximation is to consider the composite material of cells plus matrix to be modelled\nas a linear, isotropic viscoelastic continuum with stress tensor u(r, t).\nThe time scale of embryonic motions during development is very long (hours) and the spatial scale is\nvery small (less than a few millimetres). We can thus ignore inertial effects in the mechanical equation\nfor the cell\u2014ECM interaction (we are in a small Reynolds number regime) and take the traction forces\ngenerated by the cells to be in mechanical equilibrium with the viscoelastic restoring forces developed in\nthe matrix and any external forces present. The mechanical cell\u2014matrix equation is then [see, for\nexample, Landau and Lifshitz 1970]\nV~r+pF=0 (7)\nwhere F is the external force (per unit matrix density) acting on the matrix and a is the stress tensor.\nConsider first the stress tensor a. It consists of contributions from the ECM and the cells and we write\n0 = 0ECM + 0ceII (8)\nThe usual expression for a linear viscoelastic material [Landau and Lifshitz 1970] gives the stress\u2014strain\nconstitutive relation as\n0ECM = [~t\n1e, + p.20M + E\u2019[r + v\u2019OI] (viscous + elastic),\nwhere\nE\u2019=EI(l+tt), v\u2019=tt\/(1\u20142v). (10)\nHere the subscript t denotes partial differentiation with respect to time, I is the unit tensor, i-~p2 are\nthe shear and bulk viscosities of the ECM, ~ and 0 are respectively the strain tensor and dilation defined\n66 J.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation\nby\nE=~(Vu+VuT), 0=V~u (11)\nand E and v are the Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson ratio respectively.\nFibrous materials are also characterised by nonlocal elastic interactions since the fibres can transmit\nstress between points in the ECM quite far apart. By arguments analogous to those which lead to the\nbiharmonic term in the cell equation (5) we should include long range effects in the elastic stress for the\ncomposite material. We could also introduce anisotropy by having a 0-dependence for E and v but,\nagain, do not do so here.\nNow consider the contribution to the stress tensor from the cell tractions, that is 0ceI1~The more cells\nthere are the greater the traction force. There is, however, experimental evidence indicating cell\u2014cell\ncontact inhibition with the traction force decreasing for large enough cell densities. This can be simply\nmodelled by assuming that the cell traction forces r(n) per unit mass of matrix initially increase with n\nbut eventually decrease with n for large enough n. Here we simply choose\nr(n) = rnl(1 + An2), (12)\nwhere T [dyne cm\/gm] is a measure of the traction force generated by a cell and A >0. Typical\nexperimental values for T are of the order of i03 dyne I ~rmof cell edge, which is a very substantial\nforce [Harris et al. 1981].\nAs the filopodia, with which the cells attach to the ECM, extend beyond their immediate\nneighbourood, it is again reasonable to include a nonlocal effect analogous to the long range diffusion\neffect we included in the cell equation. We thus take the contribution 0ceII to the stress tensor to be\n2 \u20141 2\n0cell = T(l + An ) n(p + yV p)I, (13)\nwhere y >0 is the measure of the nonlocal long-range cell\u2014ECM interaction. The long range effects\nhere are more important than the long range diffusion effect in the cell equation.\nFinally consider the body force F in eq. (7). With the applications discussed below, the matrix\nmaterial is attached to a substratum of underlying tissue by what can perhaps be best described as kinds\nof guy ropes. We model these restraining forces as body forces per unit matrix density proportional to\nthe displacement of the matrix from its unstrained position and thus take\nF=\u2014su, (14)\nwhere s > 0 is an elastic parameter characterising the substrate attachments.\nThus the force equation we take for the mechanical equilibrium between the cells and the ECM is\neq. (7), with eqs. (8)\u2014(14), which gives\nV~[p~r\n1+ \/22011 + E\u2019(r + v\u2019OI) + Tn(1 + An2)\u2019(p + yV2p)I] \u2014 spu = 0, (15)\n(viscous + elastic + cell traction + external forces)\nwhere E\u2019 and v\u2019 are defined by eq. (10).\nJ. D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 67\n2.3. Matrix conservation equation\nThe conservation equation for the matrix material, p(r, t), is\n\u00f4ph9t + V~(p iluIdt) 0, (16)\nthat is, the matrix only moves by convection. At certain times the cells secrete matrix, but not with the\napplications we shall be discussing so we omit it here.\nEquations (5), (15) and (16) constitute the field equations for our model pattern formation\nmechanism for fibroblast cells. The model involves 13 parameters, namely D1, D2, a, r, N, i-~\/22\u2019 T, A,\ny, s, E and ii, all of which are in principle measurable and some of which are currently being\ninvestigated experimentally.\nTo assess the relative importance of the various effects we nondimensionalize the equations. We use\ngeneral length and time scales L and T, typical cell and matrix densities N and p0 and set\nr*=rIL, t*=t\/T, n*n\/N, u*=uIL, p*=pIpo,\nV*=LV, 0*=0, E~E, y*7IL\n2 r*rNT,\ns*=5p\n0L\n2(1+p)\/E A*=AN2, r*=rpoN(1+v)IE, (17)\na*=ap\n0TIL\n2, \/2~\u2019=~(l+v)\/TE, i=1,2,\n= D\n1T\/L\n2, D~= D\n5TIL\n4.\nDepending on what time and length scales we are particularly concerned with we can reduce the\nparameter set further. For example, if we choose T as the mitotic time 1 I rN, then r* = 1: this means we\nare interested in the evolution of pattern on the mitotic time scale. Alternatively we could choose T so\nthat y~= 1 or = 1 for i = 1 or 2. Similarly we can choose a relevant length scale and further reduce\nthe number of groupings.\nThe model mechanism is thus, on dropping the asterisks for notational simplicity,\nn\n1 = D1V\n2n \u2014 D\n2V\n4n \u2014V\u2022 (anVp) \u2014V~(nu\n1) + rn(1 \u2014 n), (18)\nV~{(\/21E, + \/22V) + (~+ i\/O!) + [rnl(1 + An2)](p + yV2p)I} = spu, (19)\np\n1+V(pu1)=0. (20)\nAlthough the model system is analytically formidable the model\u2019s conceptual framework is quite clear,\nas illustrated in fig. 2.1.\nThis model does not include all the effects that might be relevant, however it suffices to show how\nsuch realistic models can be constructed. One of the major roles of such modelling and subsequent\nanalysis is to indicate just what features are essential for pattern formation. Although the following\nlinear analysis can be carried out for the full system we simply want to demonstrate the pattern\nformation potential and so look at a simple version of the model (18\u201420) in which we set various\nparameters to zero.\n68 J. D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation\ncell tractions\ncelltton\nFig. 2.1. Conceptual framework for the mechanical models. Cell tractions play a central role in orchestrating pattern formation.\n3. Simple model: linear analysis, dispersion relation and pattern formation potential\nTo model spatial aspects observed in embryonic development the basic system (18\u201420) must admit\nspatially inhomogeneous solutions. There is little hope, at this stage, of finding useful analytic solutions\nto such nonlinear systems. However, much of the pattern formation potential is predicted by a linear\nanalysis about uniform steady state solutions. Such predictions must be backed up by a nonlinear theory\nor by numerical simulations if finite amplitude structures far from homogeneity are required.\nLet us consider a particularly simple version of (18\u201420) by taking diffusion and haptotaxis to be\nnegligible, that is D1 = D2 = a = 0. Further consider the situation with no cell proliferation so r = 0 and\nwhere, for illustrative purposes only, there is no cell\u2014cell inhibition so A = 0. In this situation the\none-dimensional version of the model mechanism becomes\nn, + (nu1)~= 0,\n+ u~+ [rn(p + yp~~)]~= spu, (21)\np1 + (pu1)~= 0,\nwhere \/2 = + p2 and we have rescaled p., r and s by E(1 + ii). The implication of the simple\nconservation equation for n is that the cells are simply convected by the matrix. This is believed to be\nthe major transport process.\nThe uniform steady state solutions of eq. (21) are\nn=u=p=0; n=1,p=0,u=1; n=p=1,u0. (22)\nThe first two solutions are not relevant as p is zero. In fact there is a general steady state n = n1, p = p1,\nu = 0 where n1 and p1 are constants. By suitable nondimensionalisation we can take these constants to\nbe 1. The linear stability of the third solution is found in the usual way by seeking solutions of (21)\nlinearized about this steady state. We thus consider n \u2014 1, p \u2014 1 and u to be small and on substituting\ninto the nonlinear system and retaining only linear terms in n \u2014 1, p \u2014 1 and u we get the following\nlinear system, where for algebraic convenience we have written n and p for n \u2014 1 and p \u2014 1 respectively:\n1. D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 69\nn1 + u~1 0,\n+ u1~+ (Tn + rp + TYPxx)x = su, (23)\np1 + u~,= 0.\nNow look for solutions by setting\n(n, p, u) exp[o-t + ikx], (24)\nwhere k is the wavenumber and 0~is the linear growth factor. Substitution of eq. (24) into (23) gives the\ndispersion relation o~= u(k\n2) as\na(k2) = \u2014b(k2)12p.k2,\n(25)\nb(k2)=yTk4+(1\u20142T)k2+s.\nSpatially heterogeneous solutions of the linear system are characterised by a dispersion o-(k2) which\nhas o-(0) \u0011 0 but which exhibits a range of unstable modes with o(k2) >0 for k2 ~ 0. All the solutions\n(24) with these k\u2019s are then linearly unstable and grow exponentially with time. In the usual way we\nexpect these unstable heterogeneous linear solutions to evolve into finite amplitude spatially structured\nsolutions.\nFrom eq. (25), if k2 = 0, the spatially homogeneous case, b(0) = s >0 and so u(k2) <0 for small\nenough k. For o(k2) >0, to exist for at least some k2 ~ 0, requires from the expression for b(k2) in eq.\n(25), that for a range of k2, b(k2)<0; that is at least r>112. Since\nbmin = s \u2014 (2r \u2014 1)2\/4yT,\nwe thus have a range of k2 >0 where o(k2) >0 if\nr> r~= (1 + ys) + [(1+ ~~)2 \u2014 1]h\/2. (26)\nThis defines a bifurcation surface in (T, y, s) parameter space wherein the homogeneous steady state is\nunstable to spatial disturbances with wavenumbers\nk~<k2<k~,k~,k~={(2T\u20141)\u00b1[(27\u20141)2\u20144s\u2019yr]112}\/2\u2019yr, (27)\nwhere T, y and s must satisfy eq. (26). There is a fastest growing linear mode, the one with wavenumber\ngiving umax which predicts, usually only in one-dimensional models with random initial conditions, the\nultimate nonlinear spatial pattern.\nFrom the dispersion relation (25), the only way a solution with o(k2) >0 can exist is if b(k2) <0,\nwhich in turn relies on a large enough cell traction r, given by eq. (26), to be precise. It is also clear\nheuristically from the mechanism that this has to be the case since the cell traction forces are the only\ncontribution to the aggregative process in the force\u2014balance equation in eq. (21). Typically values for\nthe cell traction, in vitro are of the order of 10~N m1 of cell edge.\nWhen eq. (26) is satisfied the dispersion relation (25) is a typical basic dispersion relation of the type\nwhich initiates spatial patterns: it is illustrated in fig. 3.1.\n70 J.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation\nunstable modes\nFig. 3.1. Behaviour of the dispersion relation o(k2), for the model (23). As the traction, r, increases above a critical r~,given by eq. (26),\nwavenumbers in the interval [k~,k~],given by eq. (27), go unstable.\nThe system (18\u201420) can display an astonishing range of dispersion relations depending on the model\nparameters. These have been analysed by Murray and Oster [1984a]. Figure 3.2 is only a selection\nwhich demonstrates the richness of dispersion relation types wherein a range of wavenumbers are\nlinearly unstable.\nThe nonlinear singular perturbation technique developed by Maini and Murray [1988]can be used on\nmechanisms with such dispersion relations of the type illustrated in fig. 3.1. They also considered\ntwo-dimensional mechanisms and obtained roll and hexagonal solutions. The significance of the latter\nwill be discussed in the following section on a biological application to skin organ morphogenesis.\nPerhaps it should be mentioned here that the spectrum of spatial patterns possible with the\nmechanism (18\u201420) and its numerous simplifications is orders of magnitude greater than with a\nreaction\u2014diffusion system \u2014 even three-species systems. The implications of a paper by Penrose [1979]\nindicate that tensor systems have solutions with a wider class of singularities than vector systems. Since\nthe cell\u2014matrix equation is a tensor equation, its solutions should thus include a wider class of\nsingularities than reaction\u2014diffusion vector systems. Even with the linear systems analytical and\nnumerical studies have only just started. Another property of models such as (21) is that the final\n__ _R1~_\nO~kz ~ __\nI I\u2019~\u2019\n~ ~\no~ ~ ~ O~ kZ ___\nh\u20195 1,.\u2014k o~\u2014\/-_-\\\nI \u2018_\u2018 kRio-\n_______ 0 kZ 0 z\nFig. 3.2. Some examples of dispersion relations o-(k\n2), obtained from the mechanical model mechanism (18\u201420) on setting various parameters to\nzero. Realistic models for those with infinite linear growth must be treated as singular perturbation problems, with small values for the appropriate\nparameters in terms which have been omitted so as to make the linear growth finite although large.\nI.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 71\nsolution will depend on the initial conditions, that is, since cell density is conserved, different initial\nconditions (and hence different cell number) will give rise to different patterns. However, as the\nrandom perturbations are small, the differences in the final solution are also small. This seems\nbiologically realistic as no two patterns are exactly the same.\nIn the following two sections we consider two biologically important and widely studied pattern\nformation problems using mechanical models of pattern generation.\n4. Periodic patterns of feather germs\nGeneration of regular patterns occurs in many situations in early embryogenesis. These are\nparticularly evident in skin organ morphogenesis such as in the formation of feather and scale primordia\nand are widely studied [see, for example, Sengel 1976, Davidson 1983a, b]. Feather formation has much\nin common with scale formation during the early developmental phase of primordia. Here we shall\nconcentrate on feather germ formation with particular reference to the chick, and fowl in general.\nFeather primordial structures are distributed across the surface of the animal in a characteristic and\nregular hexagonal fashion. The application of the Oster\u2014Murray mechanical theory to feather germ\nprimordia was first put forward by Murray et al. [1983]and Oster et al. [1983]and it is their scenario we\ndescribe here. We first present the biological background which suggests a mechanical model.\nVertebrate skin consists essentially of two layers; an epithelial epidermis overlays a much thicker\nmesenchymal dermis and is separated from it by a fibrous basal lamina. In general, epithelial cells do\nnot move, but the epithelial layer can deform through buckling. Dermal cells are loosely packed and\nmotile and can move around in the extracellular matrix, the ECM, as we described earlier. The earliest\nobservable developmental stages of feather and scale germs begin the same way. We shall concentrate\nhere on the initiation and subsequent appearance of feather rudiments in the dorsal pteryla \u2014 the\nfeather forming region on the chick back.\nIn the chick the first feather rudiments become visible about 6 days after egg fertilization. Each\nfeather germ, or primordium, consists of a thickening of the epidermis with one or more layers of\ncolumnar cells, called a placode, beneath which is an aggregation of dennal (mesenchymal) cells, called\na papilla. The dermal condensations are largely the result of cell migration, with localised proliferation\nplaying a secondary role. Whether or not the placodes form prior to the dermal papillae is a\ncontroversial issue. There is considerable experimental work going on to determine the order of\nappearance or, indeed, whether the epidermis and dermis interact to produce their patterns simulta-\nneously. The dermis seems to determine the spatial patterning \u2014 as shown by epidermal\u2014dermal\nrecombination experiments [Rawles 1963, Dhouailly 1975]. The model we discuss here is for the\nformation of dermal papillae. Subsequent development, however, is a coordinated process involving\nboth the epidermal and dermal layers [Sengel 1976, Wessells 1977].\nDavidson [1983a,b] demonstrates that chick feather primordia appear sequentially. A central\ncolumn of dermal cells forms on the dorsal pteiyla and subsequently breaks up into a row of papillae.\nAs the papillae form, tension lines develop joining the cell aggregation centres. With the above\nmechanical models this is consistent with the cells trying to align the ECM. Now lateral rows of papillae\nform sequentially but these are interdigitated with the papillae in the preceding row: see fig. 4.1. These\nlateral rows spread out from the central midline almost like a wave of pattern initiation. Experiments by\nDavidson [1983]tend to confirm this wave theory \u2014 later we show how these results can be explained by\nour model and we present corroborative numerical results.\n72 J. D.

These cell aggregations are the primordial papillae for feathers and\nscales. (d) Vertical cross section qualitatively showing the feathergerm primordia. The placodes in the epidermis are underlain by the papillae which\ncreate the stress field. (b) Subsequent aggregations form laterally. The prestressed strain field from the first line of condensations induces a bias so\nthat the neighbouring line of papillae interdigitate with the first line (stage 2). The resulting periodic array is thus hexagonal, the basic unit of which\nis illustrated in (c) (stage 3). (e) The epidermal placode pattern that mirrors the dermal pattern.\nThese observations suggest that it is reasonable first to model the pattern formation process for the\ninitial row of papillae by a one-dimensional column of cells and look for the conditions for spatial\ninstability which generates a row of papillae. This is stage 1 and is illustrated in fig. 4.la.\nWe have seen in the previous sections that even the simple mechanical model (21) can generate\nspatial patterns as the cell traction parameter r increases beyond some critical value r~.At this value a\nmode with a specific wavenumber k~,that is, with wavelength 21TIk~,first becomes unstable and a\nspatial pattern starts to evolve: this generates a regular pattern of dermal papillae.\nSimulations of the one-dimensional version of the following nonlinear mechanical model, a simpler\nversion of the more comprehensive model (18\u201420), have been carried out by Perelson et al. [1986],viz,\n\u00f4nI\u00f4t = D1c9\n2n\/\u00f4x2 \u2014 dI~x(nt9u\/t9t) \u2014 aalax (n9pI~x), (28)\n9ldx{p.d2u\/oxat + ~9uI~x+ [TnI(l + An2)](p + ya2pI~x2)}= sup, (29)\naplot+ oIax(pauldt)=0. (30)\nThey particularly addressed the problem of mode selection in models with many parameters, and\nproposed a simple scheme for determining parameter sets to isolate and \u201cgrow\u201d a specific wavelength\nJ.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 73\npattern. Figure 4.2a shows a typical steady state pattern of cell aggregations (the papillae), ECM\ndensity variations and matrix displacement. As we would expect intuitively, the cell aggregations are in\nphase with the ECM density variations p, and both are out of phase with the ECM displacement u. The\nreason is that the cell aggregations pull the matrix towards the areas of higher cell density thus\nstretching the matrix between them: fig. 4. id illustrates what is going on physically.\nPatterns of the type illustrated in fig. 4.la occur only if the cell traction parameter is above a certain\ncritical value (see section 3). Thus a possible scenario for the formation of the pattern along the dorsal\nmidline is that there is a wave of initiation that sweeps down the column which could be related to\ntissue age; in this case it is known (from in vitro experiments) that the cell traction parameter increases.\nAs the cells become stronger T passes through the critical value Tc and pattern in initiated.\nLet us now consider the formation of the distinctive hexagonal two-dimensional pattern of papillae.\nWe described above how a wave of pattern initiation seems to spread out from the dorsal midline. This\nmeans that the pattern of matrix strains set up by the initial row of papillae biases the formation of the\nsecondary condensations at positions displaced from the first line by half a wavelength. Figure 4.2b\nshows the resulting numerical simulation: note how the patterns are out of phase with those in fig. 4.2a.\nIf we now look at figs. 4.ib, c we see how this scenario generates a regular hexagonal pattern in a\nsequential way like a wave emanating from the central dorsal midline.\nThis \u201cwave\u201d is, however, not a wave in the usual sense since if the dermal layer is cut along a line\nparallel to the dorsal midline the wave simply starts up again beyond the cut ab initio. This is consistent\nwith Davidson\u2019s experimental observations [1983b].\nThe modelling here does not cast light on the controversy regarding the order of formation of\nplacodes and papillae. However, since the traction forces generated by the dermal cells can be quite\nlarge the model lends support to the view that the dermis controls the pattern evenif it does not initiate\nit. Current thinking tends towards the view that initiation requires tissue interaction between the dermis\nxlOt\n_ H\nx1O~~\n_ H\nFig. 4.2.

It is well known that mechanical deformations affect mitosis and so tissue interaction is a\nnatural effect to include in mechanical models: see also the discussion in Oster et al. [1983]. Nagorcka\net al. [1987]investigated a tissue interaction mechanism specifically with the complex patterns of scales\nin mind.\n5. Cartilage condensations in limb morphogenesis\nThe vertebrate limb is one of the most widely and easily studied developmental systems and such\nstudies have played a major role in embryology. Experimental evidence from amphibians suggests that\nosmotic properties of the ECM may be important in morphogenesis. Hyaluronate is a principal\ncomponent of the ECM and can exist in a swollen osmotic state. As the condensation of chondrocytes\nstarts the cells secrete an enzyme, hyaluronidase, which degrades the hyaluronate. This could lead to\nthe osmotic collapse of the matrix thus bringing the cells into close enough contact to initiate active\ncontractions and thus generate cell aggregations. Cell motility is probably not important in this\nscenario.\nA mechanical model for generating the pattern of cell condensations which evolve in a developing\nlimb bud and which eventually becomes cartilage was first put forward by Murray et al. [1983] and\nOster et al. [1983].A modification of the mechanical model to incorporate the above chemical aspects\nand the added forces caused by osmotic pressure has been proposed and analysed by Oster et al. [1985].\nThey showed that such a mechanochemical model would generate similar chondrogenic patterning for\nthe developing limb to that obtained with the earlier mechanical model.\nThe pattern in developing limb buds which determines the final cartilage patterns, which later ossify\ninto bones, involves aggregations of chondrocyte cells, which are mesenchymal cells such as we have\nbeen considering. The basic evolution of chondrocyte patterns takes place sequentially as the limb bud\ngrows, which it does from the distal end. Figure 5.1 gives an explanation of how, with geometry and\nscale as bifurcation parameters, chondrogenesis could proceed. The actual sequence of patterns for the\ndeveloping chick limb is illustrated in fig. 5. ic. The detailed explanation of the process based on a\nmechanical mechanism is the following.\nAs the limb bud grows, through cell proliferation at the distal end, the cross section of the tissue\ndomain, which includes the ECM and mesenchymal cells, is approximately circular but with an elliptical\nbias. Let us consider this to be the two-dimensional domain for our mechanical model with zero flux\nboundary conditions for the cells n and matrix p. The condition for u is an imposed restraining force\nwhich comes from the epidermis \u2014 the sleeve of the limb bud. We suppose that as the cells age the\ntraction increases and eventually passes through the critical values i~. The detailed form of the\ndispersion relation is such that the first bifurcation produces a single central aggregation of cells\nrecruited from the surrounding tissue.\nThe axial cell aggregations are influenced by the cross-sectional shape as shown in fig. 5.la. As the\ncells condense into a single aggregation they generate a strong centrally directed stress as in fig. 5. lb.\nThis radial stress deforms the already slightly elliptical cross section to make it even more elliptical\nwhich in turn induces a bifurcation to two condensations because of the changed flatter geometry of the\ncross section. An aerofoil section gives rise to two condensations of different size.\nAs distinct from chemical prepattern models mechanical models influence the shape of the domain\nand can actually induce the sequence of bifurcations shown in fig. 5.ic.\nI.D.

(a) The type of axial condensation is influenced by the cross-sectional shape of the limb. Initially a single condensation, path 1, will be\nproduced (for example, the humerus in (c)). A more elliptical cross section allows two aggregations to form, path 2. An aerofoil-shaped domain\nproduced unequal condensations (for example, the radius and ulna in (c)). In a long thin cylinder the axial condensations form segmental units, path\n3 (for example, the phalanges in (c)). (b) This shows how the mechanical mechanism influences cross-sectional form and hence induces the required\nsequence of chondrogenic patterns. As the cells form the central condensation their tractions deform the limb to be more elliptical. At a critical\nellipticity the pattern bifurcates to two condensations. How three condensations are formed is important and explained in the text: refer also to fig.\n5.2d. (c) The schematic bifurcation sequence of chondrocyte (mesenchymal) cell aggregations which presage cartilage formation in the developing\nchick limb.\nAfter a two-condensation state has been obtained, further growth and flattening can generate the\nmore distal patterns. By the time the limb bud is sufficiently flat, cell traction recruitment effectively\nisolates patterning of the digits. The domain can now be considered linear and subsequent growth\ninduces longitudinal or segmental bifurcations with more condensations simply fitted in as the domain\nincreases and we get the simple laying down of segments, for example, the phalanges in fig. 5.lc, as\npredicted by fig. 5.la, path 3.\n76 J.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation\nThe sequence of cell pattern bifurcations need not be generated by a changing geometry; it can result\nfrom a variation of other parameters in the model. Also asymmetric condensations can result from a\nspatial variation or asymmetry in a parameter across the limb cross-section. There is well-documented\nexperimental evidence for asymmetric properties, which, of course, are reflected in the different bone\nshapes and sizes in the limb such as the radius and ulna in fig. 5. ic. Whatever triggers the bifurcations\nas we move from the proximal to distal part of the limb the natural sequence is from a single\ncondensation to two condensations and then to several.\nMorphogenetic rules for cartilage morphogenesis in the limb\nWith a completely symmetric geometry and tissue isotropy it is possible to move through the\nbifurcation space of parameters from one aggregation to two to three and so on. With the natural\nanisotropy in embryological tissue such isotropy does not exist. The question then arises as to how the\npattern sequence from a double to a triple condensation is effected. During chondrogenesis there\nappears to be little cell division, which implies that condensations principally form through recruitment\nof cells from neighbouring tissue. Thus, as the limb bud grows the pattern bifurcation that takes place\nfollowing a branching bifurcation is as illustrated in fig. 5.2c. Figures 5 .2a, b show the other two basic\ncondensation elements in setting up a cell condensation pattern in a developing limb. We believe that\nfor all practical purposes the process giving rise to triple bifurcation must be that in which one branch of\nthe double condensation itself undergoes a branching bifurcation.\nIf we now take the bifurcating pattern elements in figs. 5.2a\u2014c as the three allowable types of cell\ncondensations we can see how they can be used to construct any limb cartilage pattern. As an example,\nfig. 5.2e illustrates this for the forelimb of a salamander. So, even without considering any specific\nmechanism, we hypothesise an important set of morphogenetic rules for the patterning sequence of\ncartilage in the development of the vertebrate limb. This hypothesis, encapsulated in the theory put\nforward by Murray et al. [1983]and Oster et al. [1983], has recently been exploited by Oster et al.\n[1988]who present extensive experimental evidence for its validity. They also discuss aspects of the\ntheory and its predictions which are of considerable potential importance in evolutionary biology.\nWe believe these rules are model independent, or rather any model mechanism for chondrogenic\npattern formation must be capable of generating such a sequence of bifurcating patterns.\nA major role of theory in morphogenesis is to suggest possible experiments to distinguish between\ndifferent models each of which can generate the appropriate sequence of patterns observed in limb\nchondrogenesis. Mechanical models lend themselves to experimental scrutiny more readily than\nreaction diffusion models because of the elusiveness of chemical morphogens.\n6. A mechanochemical model for wound healing\nThe process of cutaneous wound healing often involves some degree of wound contraction, the\nmovement of the wound boundary and adjacent uninjured tissue towards the wound centre. In some\ncases, contraction can be advantageous for wound closure; however, it can create functional impairment\n(e.g. when contraction occurs near a joint) as well as be cosmetically unattractive (e.g. facial wounds) in\nothers. Experimental investigations have demonstrated that fibroblast cells repopulate a wound and are\nresponsible for contraction [Rudolph 1979]. Thus, cutaneous wound contraction is clearly a physiologi-\ncal process in which cell forces are of great importance. The mechanochemical modelling approach not\nonly provides a framework for understanding how events in wound healing are orchestrated so as to\nJ. D.

There is also considerable evidence that cutaneous wound healing\ncan serve as a model for understanding a whole class of soft tissue pathologies, from fibrotic disorders\nto generation of tumours [Seemayer et al. 1981].\nWound contraction occurs in the context of other phases of wound healing which may be influential\nin the initiation and regulation of contraction [Clark 1985]. Inflammatory cells are believed to release a\nhost of chemical stimuli for fibroblasts (e.g. growth factors and chemoattractants) that govern the\nsubsequent phases of repair: biosynthesis of wound matrix followed by an extended period of matrix\nremodelling, which typically results in a dense collagenous scar. Contraction usually parallels the\nbiosynthetic phase when collagen and other matrix macromolecules replace the initial fibrin clot. The\nclose temporal relationship of contraction with inflammation and matrix biosynthesis provides two\nscenarios to be considered within the basic mechanochemical model.\n78 J.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models ofbiological pattern formation\nUnlike for the previous applications of the model, there are quantitative data already available for\ncutaneous wound contraction for comparison with model predictions. In a study by McGrath and Simon\n[1983]addressing the longstanding controversy of what type of wound closes fastest, they observed that\nthe contracting phase of \u201cfull thickness\u201d dermal wounds on rats could be described with a simple\nexponential dependence on time:\nA=Af+(A0\u2014Af)e~~,\nwhere A0 is the wound area when contraction begins and A~is the area remaining after contraction is\ncompleted (areas are scaled to the excised area). The time constant, k, was found to be independent of\nboth the initial wound area and wound geometry for the limited cases studied (6.25 cm\n2 and 12.54 cm2\nsquares and 12.54 cm2 circles).\nIn addition to assessing the model\u2019s admissability of such quantitative predictions, it is necessary to\nconsider what qualitative features relevant to wound contraction should be intrinsic to the model. A\nrather obvious one serves to constrain the permissible parameter space: unwounded skin should be in\nsome sense stable to at least small perturbations. Given the pattern forming capabilities of the models\ndescribed above, this is not a trivial consideration. This is addressed using linear stability analysis of the\nuniform state of the type outlined earlier. Other relevant features are not as objective, but reflect the\ntypical outcome of a wound: a rapid initial expansion of the wound followed by a longer period of\ncontraction with increase in collagen content.\nThe base model upon which the two scenarios are considered assumes that the cells move by random\ndispersion and convection only and proliferate according to a logistic rate law. (Other modes of\nfibroblast migration such as chemotaxis and contact guidance, although not considered here, are\ngenerally believed to play a significant role in fibroblast repopulation of a wound space. Also there are\nmany speculated effects of biochemical mediators on fibroblast behaviour, ranging from oxygen\nconcentration modulation of proliferation to inflammation-derived growth factor-modulation of trac-\ntion. The latter, a key element is considered in the first scenario here.) The dermis is again assumed to\nbe a matrix adequately described by a linear, isotropic, viscoelastic stress tensor modified with the local\ncell tractional force term. (Thus osmotic forces which develop in the wound space are neglected here, as\nare any consequences of matrix fibre anisotropy which might develop during wound healing.) The\nattachment of the dermis to underlying anatomical features is modelled by the linearly elastic body\nforce. Virtually all animal models used for the study of wound healing possess the panniculus carnosus,\na skin organ underlying the dermis which is absent in humans and confers great mobility to animal\ndermis relative to human dermis in response to stress. This may be accounted for at the simplest level\nby considering the elastic constant associated with underlying attachment of the skin, s, to be small and\nlarge respectively. The system of equations for this base model takes the form:\nn\n1 + V.(nu,) = D1V\n2n + rn(1 \u2014 n), (31)\nV~{p.\n1e1 + p.2O~I+ E(r + i\/O!) + TnpII(1 + An\n2)} = spu, (32)\np,+V.(pu\n1)ziO. (33)\nThe associated dimensionless variables and parameters are the same as in eq. (17).\nThe idealization of the initial state of a wound is that u = 0 and p = 1 for all x in the, (infinite)\nJ.D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 79\ndomain, and that inside some initial wound boundary, Xb, n =0 while for all x outside the boundary,\nn = 1. This implies that the wound matrix (that is, fibrtn clot) is formed instantaneously relative to the\ncontraction phase and that it is devoid of fibroblasts, which are accurate assumptions [Clark 1985].\nFurther, it is assumed that the mechanical properties of the wound matrix are the same as the\nsurrounding dermis, and this remains true for the wound matrix for all times as it becomes modified due\nto cell biosynthesis. These are much less accurate assumptions but appropriate given the complex\nmodifications of the wound matrix composition that occurs during wound healing [Clark 1985, Weigel et\nal. 1986].\nAlthough it can be shown that this base model admits the occurrence of a stable nonuniform\nsteady-state evolving from the initial state, neither the qualitative features of such a steady-state nor its\nevolution from the initial state are consistent with those of a contracting wound. These deficiencies are\nremedied in both of the following scenarios.\nIn the first scenario, we assume for simplicity that the inflammatory mediator exists as a stable\nconcentration gradient exponentially decreasing from the wound centre over the time-course of\ncontraction (models of inflammation provide a basis for extending this simple description [see Alt and\nLauffenburger 1987]). There are various mechanisms by which this mediator could influence the\nbehavioural properties of fibroblasts. Experimental evidence indicates that fibroblasts transform into\nhighly contractile myofibroblasts near a wound due to some mediator [Skalli and Gabianni 1987] and\nsuggests that the traction parameter, T, should depend on mediator concentration, c, according to\nT=r0{1+T~cI(1+c)}\nwhere ~is a traction enhancement coefficient. c is taken to have the following dependence on distance\nx from the wound centre,\nc = c0 exp[\u2014x\n2\/u]\nwhere c\n0 is the concentration at the wound centre scaled to the concentration for half-maximal traction\nenhancement and a- is a parameter specifying the spatial domain of influence of the mediator from the\nwound centre.\nAssuming matrix strains are sufficiently small we can linearise the conservation equation for p in eq.\n(33): in one space dimension\np1+(u1)~=0~p=1\u2014u~. (34)\nIf we further assume the cell density in the steady state is essentially n = n~= 1, which is a solution of\neq. (31), an approximation to the steady-state profile u5(x) is given by substituting for p from eq. (34)\ninto eq. (32) to get\n( r \\ d2u5 \u2014 ( du~\u2019\\( drldx 35\n~1- 1+A!d~~dx)~\u2019 1+A (\nThe solution of eq. (35) gives the final contracted state of the wound matrix displacement, u5, given the\npersistent gradient of inflammatory mediator. The profiles obtained in this manner agree well with\nthose obtained from numerical solution of the full system of equations (31\u201433). An example of the\ntransient profiles is given in fig. 6.1 for the case of linear wound geometry.\n80 1. D.

Numerical results for the variable traction case of the wound contraction model for linear geometry: (a) cell density, n; (b) displacement of\ncell\/matrix composite, u; (c) and matrix density, p, are plotted versus distance, x, from the wound centre for a series of times after wounding. The\nimposed traction gradient is indicated by the dashed line (i~= 2.5, c0 = 1). In (d) the relative wound area, a, is plotted as a function of time (a >1 is\nassociated with wound expansion, a < 1 is associated with wound contraction). The straight line is the linear least squares regression line of a\ntransformed according to the exponential form suggested by McGraw and Simon [19831.See text for further discussion. Parameter values:\nD1 =0.001, ~r= 1, r = 1, s = 100, r~= 0.5, A = 1.5, cc = 0.4, where z = j.c~+ ~.c2,and ~s,s and c0 are all scaled by 1 + V.\nThe repopulation of the wound space by cells (that is fibroblasts) by random migration and\nproliferation is seen in fig. 6. la to restore the cell concentration to that characteristic of the unwounded\ndermis. The evolution of the matrix to a contracted steady-state is apparent in fig. 6.lb. Associated with\nthe contraction is an increase in the matrix density as seen in fig. 6. ic. The plot of the wound area over\ntime relative to the initial wound area in fig. 6. id, which is identical to a plot of the \u201ccontracting phase\u201d\nas analysed by McGrath and Simon, suggests that the cell\u2014matrix-mediator mechanisms of this scenario\ncan conspire to yield the empirical exponential description which they observed. The time constant, k,\ncalculated from the numerical simulation is independent of the initial wound area, in agreement with\ntheir findings, since the solutions are obtained for dimensionless variables on an infinite domain. We\nfound that the analogous simulation in cylindrical polar coordinates gives approximately the same value\nfor k (1.00 versus 1.01), which is also in agreement with McGrath and Simon\u2019s [1983]related finding\nthat k is independent of geometry.\nI.D. Murray et a!., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 81\nIn the second scenario, the basic model is modified to include a matrix biosynthesis term, accounting\nfor the extensive deposition of collagen and other matrix macromolecules by fibroblasts in the wound\nregion. Since the functional dependence of this biosynthesis rate on n, u and p is not yet known, we\nassume for illustrative purposes here that net rate of biosynthesis is proportional to that of proliferation\n(that is, biosynthesis has a logistic-type rate law, bn(1 \u2014 n)). A priori prediction of a contracted\nsteady-state is more difficult with this model scenario. An example of the numerical solution of eqs.\n(31\u201433) with the biosynthesis term included in eq. (33) is shown in fig. 6.2, again for a linear wound. It\nshares many similarities with the other scenario, including a contracted steady-state reasonably\ndescribed with an exponential which is again independent of initial wound area and approximately the\nsame for both linear and circular wound geometries (1.02 versus 1.03).\nThere are many scenarios which can be considered given the complexity of the wound healing\nphenomenon. The mechanochemical model offers a possibility of considering the effects of various\nknown and speculated responses and dermal\/wound matrix properties individually as well as collective-\nly. An improved understanding of how these effects are interrelated could lead to new possibilities for\ncontrolling wound contraction and optimizing the wound healing response. Such initial success is\nencouraging for future work in this area and such studies are currently in progress.\n.\u2014~ 2.0\n1.0 ~\u2014 * 1.0 N\n\u2014 TIme,T ~ \/\n~ 0.8~ \/\n0 i::~ 0.0~----- \u2014\n\u2014 a) \u2018~\u2018\nret 06 - \/ 1 E\n- \/ ~_ ~ -1.0 ;~ \u2014 --\n._~ 0.4 \u2014z.o \u2018~ \u2014 \u2014 -\na) \u2014\u2014\u2014 rI)\nC.) 4 ~ \u2014\n0.2 \u2014 \u2014 \u20143.0 ~ -\n0.0 a I I II \u20144.0 b I I I\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0\nDistance, x Distance, x\n1.04\n1.6 1.02 ~g Transformed\n\/\/ ~ ~.iI\nDistance, x Time, T\nFig. 6.2.

Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation\n7. Other applications of mechanochemical models\nThere are many potential applications which have not yet been examined in depth or even not at all.\nHere we mention a few, but only very briefly.\n(i) Postfertilization waves on eggs. These waves are associated with pairs of mechanical and chemical\nphenomena observed on the surface of many vertebrate eggs shortly after fertilization. The waves\neffectively emanate from the sperm entry point and sweep over the egg. A mechanical model for the\negg surface based on a contractile machinery, similar to that involved in muscle contraction, wherein\nthe contraction is intimately related to the calcium chemistry involved has been developed and studied\nby Cheer et al. [1987]and Lane et al. [1987].In the latter paper analytical results are obtained for the\nwave profiles of the mechanical and chemical waves and the results compare well qualitatively with\nobservations.\n(ii) Animal coatpatterns. Murray (1981) showed that many of the patterns observed on mammalian\ncoat patterns could be generated with a morphogen based reaction diffusion mechanism. The patterns\nthus generated were considered the chemical prepatterns to which the melanoblast cells, the precursors\nof melanocytes, the pigment forming cells respond. The evidence presented for such a theory was based\non observational comparisons and on certain developmental constraints which are dictated by the\ngeometry and scale of the animal\u2019s surface when the pre-pattern is laid down. These melanoblast cells\nmigrate from the neural crest early in development. Since the model discussed in section 2 deals\nspecifically with such migratory cells it is possibly directly applicable to patterns found on mammalian\ncoats. In view of the evident richness of patterns which our mechanical models can generate, it is clear\nthat we can obtain not only similar patterns to those from a reaction diffusion mechanism but others\nwhich the latter cannot exhibit. -\n(iii) Rejection of artificial joints. One of the problems with artificial hip joints is that the cement for\nfixing them inside the femur does not form a good bond with the living tissue. The concepts used in\nsetting up the cell motility mechanisms suggest that a way to effect a more suitable bond might be to try\nand produce an adhesive which is sufficiently porous to allow movement of cells into it, by virtue of the\ncell tractions.\n8. Discussion\nThere can be no doubt that mechanochemical processes are involved in development. The models we\nhave described here represent a new approach and the concepts suggest that mechanical forces could be\nthe principal guiding elements in producing the correct sequence of tissue patterning and shapes which\nare found in the developing embryo. Whereas in reaction diffusion models a chemical morphogen\nprepattern is set up, which is then read and interpreted by the cell as required, in a mechanochemical\nframework pattern formation and morphogenesis are one and the same.\nThe models simply reflect the laws of mechanics as applied to tissue cells and their environment and\nare based on known biological and biochemical facts: all of the parameters involved are in principle\nmeasurable.\nWe should add that these models are first attempts, and considerable mathematical analysis is\nrequired to investigate their potentialities to the full. In turn this will suggest model modifications in the\nusual way of realistic biological modeling. At this stage the analysis has only just been started but is\nsufficient to indicate a wealth of wide-ranging patterns and mathematically challenging problems. The\nJ. D. Murray et al., Mechanochemical models of biological pattern formation 83\nmodels have already been applied realistically to a variety of morphogenetic problems of current major\ninterest. The results and basic ideas have initiated considerable experimental investigation and new\nways of looking at a wide spectrum of embryological problems.\nThe emergence of spatial pattern in the embryo is still unresolved. No mathematical model can take\ninto account the very complex physical, chemical and electrical processes involved in morphogenesis.\nEvery mathematical model is a gross simplification of the actual processes involved. However, in\nmaking such simplifications, one is trying to capture the essential mechanisms involved. The role of\nmathematical models is to try to highlight the possible interactions between specific biological processes\nand to suggest relevant experiments. They have generated and directed a great deal of experimental\nactivity among biologists, and from this point of view, such models for morphogenesis are fulfilling their\nrole.\nAcknowledgements\nPKM would like to acknowledge the Science and Engineering Research Council of Great Britain for\nits support (Grant GR\/ c\/63595).
