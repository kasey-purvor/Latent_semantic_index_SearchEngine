Stephen Town \n \nABSTRACT \n \nIt remains unresolved from the literature whether benchmarking is a useful and \nappropriate tool for the library and information services sector. The aim of this \nresearch was to gather evidence to establish whether benchmarking provides a \nreal and lasting benefit to library and information services. The study investigated \nthe long term effects of a benchmarking exercise on the quality level of three UK \nacademic libraries. However, an appropriate framework for assessing the quality \nlevel of libraries is not present in the literature, and it was therefore necessary for \nsuch a framework to be developed. This article describes and provides initial \ncharacterisation of the framework developed - the Quality Maturity Model. The \nevidence from the investigation showed that the two libraries which were at stage \none on the QMM before the benchmarking exercise remained there; and the \nlibrary which scored at the penultimate level, level four, before benchmarking, \nwas, four years afterwards, at level five. The tentative conclusion drawn were \nthat benchmarking may only be appropriate for organisations with a existing high \nlevel of quality maturity. Much further work is proposed. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nBenchmarking has been a widely used tool in business and industry for twenty \nfive years. It has been credited with enabling companies to survive changes that \nwould otherwise have pushed them into crisis, by improving quality (Camp, \n1989). It is usually linked to Total Quality Management \u2013 an approach to quality \nthat embraces the whole organisation and takes the customer as its starting point \n(Oakland, 1995). \n \nThe potential benefits of benchmarking for library and information services have \nbeen widely acknowledged. Library and information services have operated in an \nenvironment that demands a demonstration of quality since the 1990s. Although \nlibraries have a very strong background of performance measurement, these \nmeasures do not address the needs of stakeholders for quality assessment. \nNumerous authors (e.g. Cheetham, 1993; Shaughnessy, 1993; Kinnel & Garrod, \n1995; Town, 1995) advocate the application of benchmarking to libraries, joined \nby SCONUL in 2000 with the publication of a benchmarking manual. \n \nBenchmarking has been applied in academic libraries in the UK since 1995, with \nsuccessful examples documented in the literature (Town, 2000). However, the \nadoption of benchmarking by libraries and information services has not been \nwidespread. Kinnell & Garrod (1995) put the figure at 7% of UK academic \nlibraries. \n \nSome authors have suggested that benchmarking is not appropriate for the \nlibrary and information sector, proclaiming it \u201cJust another management fad\u201c \n(Brockman, 1992). Suggested barriers to the take up of benchmarking include \nthe vocabulary of management techniques, the level of commitment required, the \nlong-term nature of the process, and fears  about professionalism (St. Clair, \n1997). \n \nBenchmarking involves a non-trivial investment in time and resources. An IBC \nstudy in 1992 (cited in Macdonald & Tanner, 1988, p.19) surveyed 80 leading \nAmerican organisations, and concluded that an average benchmarking study \nlasts for six months, occupies 25% of team members\u2018 time, and costs \u00a345,000. \n \nGiven this significant investment required to apply the technique, decision \nmakers require unequivical evidence that establishes whether benchmarking \nprovides a real and lasting benefit to library and information services. \n \nTHE INVESTIGATION \n \nTo try to determine whether benchmarking really does improve the quality of a \nlibrary, or whether it can be considered just another passing fad, the effects of \nbenchmarking exercises in three academic libraries was investigated. These \nlibraries had undertaken a benchmarking exercise four years before this \ninvestigation. The aim was to determine whether the benchmarking exercise had \nprovided real and lasting benefits to each of the participating libraries. \n \nThe research employed a qualitative case study approach, and the method used \nwas a combination of documentary analysis and structured interviews. The \ndocumentary analysis was undertaken on both strategic and procedural \ndocuments, from the public domain, internal to the institutional, and internal to \nthe library. Interview participants were a sample of staff from each service, \nreflecting all levels within the library and different periods of employment. \n \nA FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING THE QUALITY PROCESS \n \nThe key to the investigation was to judge whether the benchmarking exercise \nhad improved the quality level of the three libraries. However, the quality \nliterature does not give a framework for the measurement of the quality \nprocesses in an organisation. There is much in the literature (e.g. Hradesky, \n1995; Oakland, 1993; Oakland, 2003; Tenner & De Toro, 1992) about \nframeworks for measuring the quality of a product, process or service, but no \nframework for measuring the quality of the quality-process. The ISO9000 \nstandard is similarly concerned with product quality, with the focus on the \ntechnical system of procedures and work instructions (Pike & Barnes, 1994) and \nnot the achievement of a quality culture. Even a book entitled \u201cAchieve total \nquality\u201d (Hutchins, 1992) gives no indication of how to tell when an organisation \nhas reached this goal! \n \nThe literature gives only one framework for measuring the quality culture of an \norganisation. The Software Engineering Institute developed the Capability \nMaturity Model (CMM) as a method of judging the quality of the software \nprocesses of an organisation (Paulk et al., 1993; Paulk, 1994). It is intended to \nbe an evolutionary path to help organisations improve the quality maturity of their \nsoftware processes from \u201cad hoc, chaotic processes to mature, disciplined \nsoftware processes\u201d (Paulk, 1994, p.3). The CMM has five levels with descriptive \ncriteria for the attainment of each level. Organisations at level one are \u2018low \nquality\u2019; organisations at level five are \u2018high quality\u2019. \n \nThis model is not as inappropriate for use in libraries as it might at first appear. \nDuring the print era, where libraries were \u2018storehouses\u2019 (Lancour, 1951), quality \ncould be assured by the rigorous application of standardised methods and work \npractices. However, with the move to the electronic era much library work is \nundertaken in the form of projects, so such methods are too inflexible to ensure \nhigh quality is maintained. The software industry is built around project work, and \nso methods that ensure high quality there are likely to transfer to the new library \nenvironment. \n \nIn order to assess the level of impact of benchmarking on the respective library \nservices, a framework for measuring the general quality of an organisation had to \nbe developed. The model created for the research was an adapted version of the \nCMM. This new model (retitled the Quality Maturity Model) allows the quality \nmaturity of a library service to be measured on a five step scale. Each point on \nthe scale has a general description of the level of quality in the organisation, with \na list of specific attributes relevant to that level. The benefit of the model is that it \ntranslates qualitative descriptions into a quantitative score of progress towards \nthe goal of a culture of continuous improvement. \n \nThe characterisations of the five levels of the Quality Maturity Model are a \nfollows: \n \nLevel 1 Initial \nThe quality management process is ad hoc, and occasionally even chaotic. Few \nprocesses are defined, and success depends on individual effort and heroics. \n\u2022 Quality is achieved in an ad hoc way. \n\u2022 Customer satisfaction is reactive and unpredictable. \n\u2022 Quality depends on the capabilities of individuals, and varies with their \ninnate skills, knowledge and motivations. \n\u2022 Training for quality is ad hoc and reactive to an ability to undertake a \nspecific task adequately. \n \nLevel 2 Repeatable \nBasic quality management processes are established. The necessary \nmanagement processes are in place to repeat earlier quality levels. \n\u2022 Quality policies, and procedures to implement these policies, are \nestablished. \n\u2022 There are effective management processes to allow the organisation to \nrepeat earlier success in customer satisfaction. \n\u2022 Such management processes are practised, documented, enforced, \ntrained, measured, and able to improve. \n\u2022 Training for quality is provided as a programme of training for specific \nwork tasks, and \/ or is reactive to events. \n \nLevel 3 Defined \nThe quality processes are documented and standardised. All work derives from \nthe organisational strategy. \n\u2022 There is a defined, documented organisational strategy, from which all \nwork processes are derived. \n\u2022 There is an organisation-wide understanding of the activities, roles, and \nresponsibilities of each member of the organisation, and how they fit into \nthe organisational strategy. \n\u2022 Training for quality is a cycle of training needs assessment and \nprogramme provision. \n \nLevel 4 Managed \n Detailed measures of the quality process are collected. The quality process is \nquantitatively understood and controlled. \n\u2022 Quality measures are part of every documented work process. \n\u2022 These measurements form the basis for evaluating products and \nprocesses. \n\u2022 Changes are implemented to improve the quality of services, products and \nprocesses. \n\u2022 The organisation sets quantitative goals for quality and customer \nsatisfaction. \n\u2022 Training for quality is a cycle of training needs assessment, programme \nprovision, and measurement of the effectiveness of the programme. \n \nLevel 5 Optimising \nContinuous quality improvement is enabled by quantitative feedback and from \npiloting innovative ideas. \n\u2022 The entire organisation is focussed on continuous improvement in every \nservice, product and process. \n\u2022 All staff are encouraged to continuously improve themselves and their \nwork. \n\u2022 The organisation is able to identify weaknesses, and the means to \nstrengthen the process, proactively with the goal of preventing problems. \n\u2022 Innovations that exploit the best practices are identified and transferred \nthroughout the organisation. \n\u2022 Training for quality is focussed on preparing staff for future organisational \nrequirements. \n \n \nAPPLYING THE FRAMEWORK \n \nThe evidence gathered from the interviews and documentary analysis was \nmapped against the model. \n \nAn indicative selection of the evidence indicating a level one library and a level \nfive library is given below (direct quotes from interviews are shown in quotation \nmarks; direct quotes from documentary analysis are shown in angle brackets): \n \nLevel one \n\u201cSince the active and energetic chair of the [quality services group] left, the group \nhas gone into abeyance.\u201d This indicates that quality is ad hoc, and dependent on \nthe innate qualities of the staff. \n<how far the QSG could go if a particular group was not sufficiently motivated to \nproduce results> was not resolved for the group, and demonstrates the lack of \nmanagerial support for quality processes. \nThe library has a strategic plan, but documented work processes unrelated to it \nand do not include quality processes. \nThe library does not make changes to improve quality, but for PR:  <[small \nchanges will] improve the customer\u2019s perception of the service and \u2026 \ndemonstrate the library is responsive to feedback>. \nStaff are not encouraged to continuously improve, but asked: <can you think of \nany improvement which could realistically be considered?> and to: \n<Separate out things which can and cannot be achieved>. \nTraining is ad hoc and responsive: \u201cThere is much [training] available - if you \nwant it you just need to ask for it.\u201d \u201cthere is support for staff to develop if they \nwant to\u201d. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to [improve] and want to stay at the same level, they \nare quite happy with that\u201d. \n \nLevel five \nContinuing improvement bonuses are available for all staff, related to \nperformance indicators against personal and team targets, which are linked to \nthe strategic aims. \nThe library, and all its staff, continually strive to improve: <The library will seek to \ncompare its performance systematically with that of other similar universities and \nemulate best practice in the sector> \u201cthere is lots of freedom to develop your own \nwork area, as long as what you do is within the strategic aims of the library.\u201d \u201cWe \ncan contribute ideas [for improvement] quite freely.\u201d <Though communication \nwithin the service was commended \u2026 we do still feel there is room for \nimprovement>. \nTraining is focused on preparing staff for future challenges: <The development of \nour staff is a major investment in the future success of the University> \u201cThey see \n[professional development] as a benefit to the whole service. The staff are \ndeveloping themselves and then give a better service to the user.\u201d \n \n \nRESULTS \n \nThe results of the research showed that two of the three libraries were at level \none on the QMM before the benchmarking study took place, and remained at \nthat level after the study, four years later. Benchmarking has not had any impact \non the long-term quality level of these libraries. This finding was supported by the \nevidence from interviewees at these libraries, who were explicitly asked: \u201cWhat \neffects did the benchmarking study have on the library?\u201d One interviewee at \nlibrary 3 replied \u201cnone at all\u201d and another interviewee at library 1 responded \u201cI do \nnot think that there was anything radical that we did that came out of the whole \nthing.\u201d Both of these libraries mentioned a \u2018Hawthorne effect\u2019 (where an \nindividual\u2019s behaviour alters because they know they are being studied) for the \nduration of the study, but not beyond. \n \nHowever, the results also showed that one of the libraries scored at level four on \nthe QMM before the benchmarking study took place, and scored at level five \nafter the study, four years later. Benchmarking did have a real and long lasting \nbeneficial effect on the quality level of this library. Again, this was supported by \nevidence from the interviewees: \u201cWe have that culture now of continuous \nimprovement. Whether it was benchmarking specifically that set it off I don\u2019t \nknow, or whether we always had it to some degree, but it acted as a catalyst \u2026 \nand it did make it much more systematic than it had been in the past.\u201d \n \nThe investigation suggests that benchmarking can have a beneficial long-term \neffect on library and information service quality. However, it also indicates that \nthis effect may only occur in library and information services that already have a \npre-existing quality approach (as shown by a high score on the QMM). \n \nThis finding is consistent with the literature: An Ernst & Young survey (1993) \nreported that benchmarking was only of benefit to higher performing \norganisations, and suggested that lower performing organisations should \nconcentrate on the basics.  Kinnell & Garrod (1995) suggest that benchmarking \ncan only be successfully implemented in libraries that have already begun to \nimplement quality management practices. \n \nThis finding is consistent with the Quality Maturity Model itself. Organisations at \nthe lower levels of quality maturity do not have an organisational culture that \nenables them to make use of benchmarking. There must be a strong \nmanagement commitment to all four elements of benchmarking (survey, \ncomparison, understanding, implementation, e.g. Camp, 1989) for an exercise to \nbe successful (St. Clair, 1993; Codling, 1998; Macdonald & Tanner, 1998). This \nwill only be the case in organisations where the goal of achieving quality \nunderpins all work policies i.e. organisations that score 4 or above on the QMM. \n \nThat a benchmarking exercise can result in an organisation moving from level 4 \non the QMM to level 5 is consistent with the proposal that benchmarking leads to \nthe creation of a learning organisation (McNair & Leibfried, 1992; Karlof & \nOstblom, 1993; Zairi & Leonard, 1994). The essential difference between level 4 \nand level 5 is that at level 4, improvement in the quality of a process is the \nresponsibility of the manager of that process. At level 5, improvement in the \nquality of a process is the responsibility of every member of staff in the \norganisation. Such staff empowerment can only be achieved successfully in a \nlearning organisation. \n \nThe finding that benchmarking is only successful in organisations with high \nquality maturity may also provide a possible indication of why benchmarking has \nbeen used with widespread success in industry, but has been felt by some to \ntransfer unsuccessfully to library and information services. The competitive \nnature of industry means that a successful company could be expected to have \nimplemented a succession of quality approaches, culminating in TQM, before \nconducting a benchmarking exercise i.e. industry started at the bottom and \nworked upwards in stages until reaching a high QMM level before applying \nbenchmarking, and so benefited from it. Library and information services have do \nnot have the same history of a quality approach, and so were not at the required \nlevel of maturity when applying benchmarking - they jumped straight into using a \ntool appropriate for high quality maturity organisations when they just weren\u2019t \nready. No wonder it failed. \n \n \nFURTHER WORK \n \nThe research described in this paper was a small exploratory study into the \nunknown. The research investigated three academic libraries and used a new \nreference model as a framework for measurement. From the results of these \ninvestigations a number of wide-ranging conclusions have been postulated. \nAlthough these conclusions do appear to be consistent with the known literature, \nthey can be viewed as nothing more than very tentative until much further \nresearch has been undertaken. \n \nThe proposed Quality Maturity Model must be tested and further characterised. \nResearch is needed to investigate whether the model is able to uniquely and \nconsistently determine the quality level of library and information services at all \nfive levels. Research is also needed to describe the properties of organisations at \nall five levels, and so enable fuller characterisation of the levels. This might in \nturn lead to an instrument to permit libraries to diagnose their own individual \nlevels of maturity, and also to recommending specific quality management \ntechniques (in addition to benchmarking) which are appropriate to a particular \nlevel of quality maturity. \n \nThis research investigated libraries that were at level 1 or level 4 prior to \nundertaking a benchmarking exercise. The conclusions propose that \nbenchmarking will only result in real and lasting benefits for libraries at level 4 on \nthe QMM before the exercise. In order for the model, and so the conclusions, to \nbe valid, this must be the point of demarcation between the two outcomes. \nFurther research is needed to determine the effects of a benchmarking study on \nlibraries that scored 2,3 and 5 on the QMM prior to their benchmarking exercise. \n \nThe initial QMM score for the three libraries in this research was obtained \nretrospectively, i.e. some time after the benchmarking exercise had taken place. \nFor the QMM to be a useful predictor of whether the investment in a \nbenchmarking exercise would be justified in term of improvements, a priori \ntesting of the quality maturity level of a library before a benchmarking exercise is \nnecessary. Research into whether the QMM is predictive is likely to be beneficial \nto the sector. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThere is still much research to be done, but a tentative conclusion can be drawn \nthat benchmarking should be viewed as a tool for organisations at a high level of \nquality maturity. When used appropriately it can have real and long-lasting \nbenefits, particularly in driving a culture of continuous improvement. When used \ninappropriately it is a waste of time and effort. We should remember not to run \nbefore we can walk. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBrockman, J.R. (1992), Just another management fad? The implications of TQM \nfor library and information services.
