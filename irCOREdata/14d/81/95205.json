Most of the literature on human mating patterns is \nbased on post-industrial societies. Much less is known about mating behaviour in more \ntraditional societies. Here we investigate mate choice by analysing whether there is any \nevidence for non-random mating with respect to size and strength in a forager \ncommunity, the Hadza of Tanzania. We test whether couples assort for height, weight, \nBMI, percent fat and grip strength. We test whether there is a male-taller norm. Finally, \nwe test for an association between anthropometric variables and number of marriages. \nOur results show no evidence for assortative mating for height, weight, BMI or percent \nfat; no evidence for a male-taller norm; and no evidence that number of marriages is \nassociated with our size variables. Hadza couples may assort positively for grip strength, \nbut grip strength does not affect the number of marriages. Overall we conclude that, in \ncontrast to post-industrial societies, mating appears to be random with respect to size in \nthe Hadza. \n \n \n \nKeywords \nMate choice, Hadza, height, strength, assortative mating, hunter-gatherers \n 3 \nIntroduction \nChoosing the right mate is an important component of fitness, particularly so in a species \nlike our own, where long-term relationships between partners are common. There is now \na large body of research investigating mating patterns within evolutionary studies of \nhuman behaviour. The great majority of this research, however, has been conducted in a \nsingle cultural setting, the post-industrial West. This narrow focus becomes problematic \nwhen researchers generalise from post-industrial populations in order to draw \nconclusions about the significance of particular mating patterns in our evolutionary \nhistory, since it ignores the very real possibility that mating patterns will show ecological \nvariation.  \n \nFor example, the importance of size as a cue has been emphasised in a number of \nrecent publications. In post-industrial populations, size appears to matter for both mate \npreferences and mate choices. Laboratory studies of preferences suggest individuals \ntake height into consideration when weighing up potential mates (Shepperd & \nStrathman1989; Higgins et al 2002). In the real world situations of mate advertising (in \nlonely hearts ads) and actual mate choice, height also appears to matter (Pawlowski & \nKoziel 2002). Similarly, weight is a factor in both stated preferences and observed \nchoices (Silventoinen et al 2003; Kurzban & Weeden 2005). Despite these relationships \nhaving been demonstrated almost entirely in post-industrial societies, they have been \nused to bolster stories about the evolution of sexual dimorphism (Nettle 2002), and to \nexplain intrasexual competition (Buunk et al 2008) and female character perception (Chu \n& Geary 2005). But if such mate preferences are contingent on ecology, they cannot \nexplain the evolution of traits common to the entire species, nor can they be used to \nmake generalised statements about the behaviour of all humans.  \n \n 4 \nHere, we investigate mate choice in a forager society, the Hadza of Tanzania, to \ndetermine whether there is evidence that mating is non-random for anthropometric \ncharacteristics. Research in post-industrial societies suggests that positive assortative \nmating is common for height and weight (Silventoinen et al 2003), and that there is a \nmale-taller norm, whereby marriages in which the female partner is taller than the male \nare much rarer than would be expected by chance (Gillis & Avis 1980; Pierce 1996). \nTaller men also appear to contract more marriages (Pawlowski et al 2000), though the \nreverse may be true for women (Nettle 2002). We investigate here whether there is any \nevidence for assortative mating, a male-taller norm, or that size affects the number of \nmarriages contracted in the Hadza. \n \nMaterial & Methods \nPopulation \nThe Hadza are hunter-gatherers who live in Tanzania in a savanna\/woodland habitat. \nThey number about 1000 and live in mobile camps that average 30 people. Women \nforage for plant foods and men hunt with bows and arrows. Women get married at \naround 17-18 years and men at age 20. There is no wedding ceremony but after a \nliaison a couple will begin sleeping at the same hearth and are considered married.  \nPolyandrous marriages do not exist but about 4% of men have two concurrent wives. \nBecause divorce is common, serial monogamy is the best way to characterize the \nmating system. Marriage is not arranged: the Hadza are extremely egalitarian so \nindividuals are not coerced into marriage. Female choice seems to be the main factor \nleading to marriage, because young single men appear willing to marry a wide range of \nwomen. Previous research on the Hadza suggests their mate preferences resemble that \nof Western mate preferences in some ways but not others. For example, Hadza men \nhave significantly different preferences for women\u2019s waist-to-hip ratio compared to \n 5 \nWestern men (Marlowe et al 2005) and place much more emphasis on women being \nhard-working and fecund (Marlowe 2004). Though preferences for size have not been \nsystematically tested in the Hadza, when asked which characteristics are attractive in a \nmate, very few individuals of either sex mention size: only 1 woman out of 46 questioned \n(2%) cited \u2018big\u2019 as desirable; 1 of 46 women (2%) and 1 of 55 men (2%) preferred \nthinness; and only 2 men out of 55 (4%) mentioned that the woman should be shorter \n(Marlowe 2004). \n \nData have been collected on the Hadza by FM since 1995. Our sample is close to the \nentire population of the Hadza, especially all those who are full-time foragers, since all \nindividuals in each camp were measured during anthropometric surveys.  \n \nMethods \nWe analysed the evidence for non-random mating for the following anthropometric \ncharacteristics: height, weight, body mass index (BMI), percent fat and handgrip \nstrength. Height and weight indicate absolute size; BMI is a measure of weight for \nheight; percent fat, measured with a bioelectrical impedence scale (Tanita), is an \nindicator of body composition. We also examine grip strength, measured using a \nSmedley 3 Dynometer, as an indicator of overall strength and work capacity (Jones & \nMarlowe 2002). We performed the following analyses: \n \nAssortative mating: Linear regression analyses were performed to determine if there is \nany evidence for assortative mating for each anthropometric characteristic. The wife\u2019s \ncharacteristic was included as the dependent variable, and the husband\u2019s characteristic \nas an independent variable. Controls were included for age of both wife and husband \nand region of residence.  \n 6 \n \nMale-taller norm: We investigated whether there is a male-taller norm by comparing the \nobserved proportion of female-taller marriages (those in which the female partner is \ntaller than the male) with the proportion of female-taller marriages expected from random \nmating. To determine the latter, we randomly coupled up women and men, and \ncalculated the proportion of marriages in which the wife was taller than the husband in \nthese randomly-mated pairs. We then performed a chi-squared test to determine \nwhether the observed number of female-taller marriages was different from that \nexpected from random mating.  \n \nNumber of marriages: Finally, we investigated whether anthropometric status is \ncorrelated with the total number of marriages contracted for each sex (during the 6 year \nperiod covered by the anthropometry data collection). The majority of individuals only \nhave one spouse recorded (~80% of women and 70% of men), and few record more \nthan two spouses (5% of women and 7% of men). So we performed logistic regressions \nto determine whether each anthropometric variable affected the probability of having \nmultiple (>1) spouses, as opposed to one spouse. Each regression analysis controlled \nfor the age and region of the individual; regressions were performed separately for men \nand women and separately for each anthopometric variable. \n \nGiven we have performed multiple statistical tests for each sex for both assortative \nmating and the probability of multiple marriage (one for each anthropometric measure), \nfor all analyses we assume a conservative alpha level of <0.01 to indicate statistical \nsignificance, based on a Bonferroni correction. \n \n 7 \nResults \nAssortative mating: Table 1 shows sample sizes and statistical output from the 5 linear \nregression models. The parameter estimates, SEs and significance values shown relate \nto the husband\u2019s characteristic (statistical output for control variables is not shown). \nThese regression coefficients show no evidence for assortative mating for height, \nweight, BMI or percent fat. The grip strength of husbands and wives is correlated at the \np<0.05 level (p=0.024). However, given that we are applying a correction for multiple \ntests, we would need a lower p value to be convinced that this is a real effect. \n \nMale-taller norm: We also find no evidence for a male-taller norm in this society. In 8.2% \nof all marriages the wife was taller than the husband (17 of 207 marriages). This is no \ndifferent from the proportion of female-taller marriages expected by chance (8.8%: \u03c72 = \n0.089, df=1, p=0.765). Figure 1 shows the proportion of female-taller marriages in this \nHadza population. RS has previously investigated this phenomenon in both a post-\nindustrial society (UK) and a pre-industrial agricultural community in the Gambia, and the \nresults of these analyses are also presented in Figure 1 for comparison (Sear 2006). \nThe proportion of female-taller marriages in the UK is significantly lower than expected \nby chance, but the two traditional populations show a frequency of female-taller \nrelationships no different from that expected from mating which is random with respect to \nheight.  \n \nNumber of marriages: logistic regression analyses demonstrated no significant effect on \nthe probability of multiple marriages for any anthropometric variable, for either sex (see \nTable 2).  \n \n 8 \nDiscussion \nThese results suggest that mating is random with respect to size in this population. Such \na conclusion is based on accepting that our null hypotheses are correct, so in order to \nprovide some confidence in our conclusion we determined the power of our statistical \ntests, using G*Power 3 (Faul et al 2007). Post-hoc tests suggest that the power of our \ntests ranges from 95-97%, assuming a medium effect size (precise power varies by test: \nanalysis provided on request). We conclude that we would have been able to detect \nsize-related mating patterns in the Hadza, were they similar to those in industrialised \npopulations. \n \nDespite the lack of evidence that size is important for mate choice, there is some weak \nevidence that strength may matter, given that the correlation between the strength of \nhusbands and wives approached significance. Assortative mating may be brought about \nif both men and women prefer strong partners, in which case the most attractive \n(strongest) male is likely to end up paired with the most attractive (strongest) female, \nleading to a positive correlation for strength. Strength has been shown to correlate with \nwork capacity in this population (Jones & Marlowe 2002), so couples may be positively \nassorting on productivity. An alternative possibility is that couples converge for strength \nafter they marry. But men and women forage separately and largely for different food \nitems in this population, so shared work patterns seem unlikely to lead to a convergence \nin strength. \n \nOverall, however, our analysis suggests size and strength are not greatly important \nwhen Hadza are choosing a mate. This lack of size-related mating patterns might appear \nsurprising, since size is usually assumed to be an indicator of health, productivity and \noverall quality. But health and productivity may be signalled in alternative ways in the \n 9 \nHadza, who are a small, relatively homogeneous population. An individual\u2019s health \nhistory may be more important than size, for example, and this may be relatively well \nknown in a small, mobile population. Additionally, there may be some disadvantages to \nlarge size in food-limited societies, where the costs of maintaining large size during \nperiods of food shortage may be high. Such disadvantages will not be seen in food-\nabundant societies, so that large size may be a better indicator of quality in post-\nindustrial populations. Finally, research on another African forager population found that \nheight is negatively correlated with hunting returns (Lee 1979), suggesting that tall height \nmay not be an indicator of productivity in such economies.  \n \nIt is also important to note that we have not systematically tested mate preferences in \nthis population, only mate choice. The distinction between mate preferences and mate \nchoice is important. While mate preferences can give useful information about which \ntraits are valued in a prospective mate, observed mate choices are arguably more \ninformative about the evolutionary implications of mating behaviour. Mate choice takes \ninto account the costs and constraints involved in acquiring a partner, and results from a \ncombination of mate preferences (which may span a number of domains, not just \nphysical cues), mate availability and one\u2019s own value on the mate market. These factors \nmay assume different importance in different environments, just as mate preferences \nmay differ between environments. We suggest that neither human mate preferences nor \nmate choices are likely to be identical across all populations, and that efforts should be \nmade to test the universality of both preferences and choices before speculation is made \non their evolutionary implications. With more data from a diverse array of populations we \ncan begin to test hypotheses about why mating patterns should vary between \nenvironments and why some patterns might indeed be universal.
