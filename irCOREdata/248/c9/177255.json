To: identify the number, nature and \nfrequency of papers published; investigate their scope and quality; identify the main \nthemes and concepts; and synthesise the findings to inform practice, policy and \nresearch. \n \nMethods Publications were systematically identified from electronic databases, hand \nsearches of bibliographies, and contact with professional organisations. Inclusion \ncriteria were applied. There were no restrictions on language, the nature of publications \nor publication year. Procedures were systematically applied for quality appraisal and \ndata extraction. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative methods were used for data \nanalysis and synthesis. \n  2 \n \nResults Search criteria yielded 2048 papers of which 42 papers met the inclusion \ncriteria. 35% of these were research-based. The papers covered 16 professional and 20 \nclient populations, and their quality was generally poor. Analysis identified six broad \nthemes: definitions of caseload management, caseload measurement and \u2018tools\u2019, \nmodels of caseload management practice, client-professional relationship, discharging, \nand professional guidance. Six papers presented issues that related to but did not fit \nwithin these themes. Current caseload management tools and models of caseload \nmanagement practice had poor evidence-base. Several papers (n=5) described benefits \nof team-based approaches. Professional guidance for caseload management is limited \nin detail and relevance to daily practice. \n \nConclusions Although the published literature presents considerable discourse about \ncaseload management the strength of evidence is limited and it is not possible to make \nsummative conclusions. Policy makers and professional bodies should encourage and \nsupport development of a cumulative evidence-base about the ways to achieve \neffective, efficient and equitable caseload management. Health and social care services \nconsidering implementing caseload management tools or models of practice should \ncritically appraise their basis, and consider their potential advantages as well as \ndisadvantages.  \n  3 \n1. Introduction \nAccessibility and equity, underpinned by efficient management of resources, are \namongst the key priorities for health care provision1-3. Following the shift from acute \nservices to community health care, increasing referral rates, growing waiting times, \nrising caseload numbers and low discharge rates are becoming increasingly challenging \nto community services both in the UK4-6 and internationally7-10\n \n. Community services \ninclude a wide range of locally provided care, for example, local hospitals\u2019 out-patient \nclinics, mental health services, learning disability teams, child and school health \nservices, and palliative care. The care may be provided by a range of professionals, for \nexample, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, health visitors, and \nmidwifes. A particular feature of community professionals\u2019 caseloads is that they cannot \nbecome \u2018full\u2019 in the same way as hospital wards; the physical context does not limit the \nnumber of clients that can be placed on community professionals\u2019 caseloads. Yet, \nprofessionals\u2019 capacity to attend to clients is limited by the time available to them and \nunmanageable caseloads could have implications on waiting times and quality of care \n(e.g. access to and equity of treatment provision). \nA range of issues at different levels11, including ecological, organisational, team, \nindividual professional and service user levels can impact on the accessibility and equity \nof service provision. Previous research in occupational therapy, physiotherapy and \nspeech and language therapy4 has identified that some of the variation in service \ndelivery is likely to relate to differences in how individual professionals manage their \nclients. This is particularly plausible in a light of wider literature in health care \n  4 \nprofessionals\u2019 autonomy. For example, individual medical practitioners have been found \nto shape service provision by rejecting practices that they believe are unfavourable and \nby implementing practices they believe to be beneficial (even where scientific evidence \nis not strong)12. Yet, in current discourse about variation in service provision, individual \nprofessionals\u2019 management of client care (e.g. frequency of treatment provision, policies \nfor discharging) has remained largely unexplored. For example, variation in waiting \ntimes has been assumed to relate to organisational and ecological factors5\n \n.  \nThis paper reports findings from a systematic review of research- and experience-based \npublished literature regarding individual community professionals\u2019 caseload \nmanagement (i.e. behaviours related to assessment, treatment and discharging of \nclients). This review did not focus on case management, which differs from the former in \nthat case management commonly refers to co-ordination of multiple services for a \nparticular client. The existing literature was summarised and explored, and a conceptual \nthematic framework of the issues was developed in a way that informs practice and \nresearch. The overarching questions were: what are the main issues in caseload \nmanagement discussed in the current literature, and what is the evidence about these \nissues? \n \nSpecific objectives were to:  \n\u2022 identify the volume, nature and frequency of relevant papers published to date;  \n\u2022 investigate scope and quality of the papers; \n\u2022 identify the main themes and concepts emerging from the included papers; and \n  5 \n\u2022 synthesise the findings \n \nSystematic reviews can be used to review effects of selected interventions or for \ndeveloping (conceptual) theory of contextual variables potentially linked to desired \noutcomes13\n \n. Our review falls into the latter category, with the specific methods \ndescribed below. \n2. Methods \nFor search strategy and inclusion of relevant papers, established procedures for \nsystematic reviews14 were followed. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included \npapers, an approach that imitated a framework for mixed methods systematic reviews \ndeveloped by Popay et al13\n \n was applied to quality appraisal, data extraction, analysis \nand synthesis. A flowchart of the methods used is presented in Figure 2, with further \ndetails for each step provided below. \nElectronic searches were undertaken of the following bibliographic databases to identify \npotentially relevant papers : MEDLINE (1966-Week 49 2006), EMBASE (1980-Week 49 \n2006), CINAHL (1982-Week 49 1980), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts \n(ASSIA) (1987-October 2006), PsycINFO (1967-October 2006), British Nursing Index \n(BNI) (1994-October 2006), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) \n(1985-September 2006), Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC) (October \n2006) and OTSeeker (October 2006). The searches incorporated both thesaurus-\ncontrolled subject heading terms and text words or phrases. Sensitivity was prioritised \n  6 \nover specificity, to ensure an inclusive search strategy. Two search facets; \u2018community \nhealth care\/services\u2019 and \u2018caseload\/ workload management\u2019 were developed. Each \nconsisted of relevant subject headings and text words combined with the Boolean \noperator \u201cOR\u201d and then the resulting sets were combined using the Boolean operator \n\u201cAND\u201d.  Full details of all the search strategies used are available from the authors. \nAdditional references were located through screening the bibliographies of articles \nincluded in the review and contacting the College of Occupational Therapists (UK), \nRoyal College of Speech and Language Therapists (UK), the Royal College of Nursing \n(UK), Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists, and National Association of \nPaediatric Occupational Therapists (UK) to identify potentially relevant papers. No \nrestrictions were placed on language, the nature (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, opinion) \nor the publication year of papers.  \n \nThe two search facets listed above, and an additional facet \u2018professional\u2019, were further \ndefined to form a set of relevance criteria that were applied to select papers for \ninclusion. \u2018Community\u2019 referred to clients living at home; \u2018professional\u2019 referred to any \nindividuals involved with direct assessment and treatment of clients (e.g. nurse, social \nworker); and \u2018caseload\/ workload management\u2019 referred to judgements, decision and \nactions related to assessment, treatment and discharging of clients. Papers were \nincluded in the review if they met all three relevance criteria. Papers were excluded if \nthey focused purely on clinical (e.g. effectiveness of a clinical intervention) or financial \nissues, validation of clinical tests, or organisational issues without direct reference to \nindividual professionals. Papers focusing on general medical practitioners were \n  7 \nexcluded as the context of their caseload management was considered to differ from \nthat of other professionals.  \n \nQualitative and quantitative information was synthesised. There is no standard, \nrecommended approach for quality appraisal, data extraction, analysis and synthesis for \nmixed methods reviews13. The methods used in this review were consistent with those \nrecommended by Popay et al13\n \n. Quality appraisal was conducted by categorising the \npapers first into those that did and did not describe a research design and methods \n(from here after labelled as \u2018research-based\u2019 and \u2018not research-based\u2019, respectively), \nand then further into one of six mutually exclusive domains (Figure 1). Within each \ndomain, the quality of papers was assessed using a descriptive checklist based on \npublished quality appraisal criteria as indicated in Table 1. The quality appraisal was \nused to modify the conclusions from the synthesis by taking more notice of the higher \nquality papers, not to make decisions about inclusion\/ exclusion of individual papers.  \nFollowing the quality appraisal, the first author familiarised herself with the papers and \nextracted descriptive data (e.g. aims, populations, key findings) from the papers into a \nsummary table. Individual papers were then analysed in-depth to identify key issues \nwithin each paper, and the issues were compared and contrasted across papers to \nidentify higher level themes. These themes were further integrated, refined and \nsynthesised through critical discussion within the research team, until an agreement \nabout the final themes, and their groupings and labels, was reached. From the themes, \nkey concepts that were considered relevant to overall caseload management process \n  8 \nwere identified. Concepts were considered relevant if they were central to several \npapers within a theme, or if they mirrored caseload management concepts found in \nhospital care literature. The final themes also guided a revision and structuring of the \ndescriptive summary table, and the table was used to develop visual summaries of the \ndescriptive data (e.g. distribution of publication years and types of papers). \n \nPaper inclusion, quality appraisal, data extraction and data synthesis were undertaken \nby the first author. Twenty percent of the papers were independently assessed for \ninclusion\/ exclusion and 10% were checked for match regarding qualitative, emerging \nthemes by the second and third authors respectively. Agreements on these were high \nand disagreements were resolved by discussion and clarification. Copies of the full \nsearch strategy, list of excluded papers, and detailed quality appraisal and data \nextraction tables are available from the first author. \n \n3. Results \nDescription of the included papers \nVolume, nature and frequency \nFrom the electronic searches, a total of 2048 abstracts were retrieved and screened. \nFrom these, 127 were identified as potentially relevant and the full text versions of these \npapers were read and assessed for relevance.  34 papers met the inclusion criteria. In \naddition, 8 papers were included from grey literature, totalling 42 papers (Figure 3, \nTable 2). The majority of included papers (65%) were not research-based, and came \nfrom either the UK or US. Visual display of publication years (Figure 4) demonstrated an \n  9 \noverall trend of increasing numbers of papers about caseload management since 1995. \nThis was largely associated with an increase in practice-based papers and opinion \npieces. There was no increasing pattern of conceptual or research papers over time. Of \nthe 42 included papers, only seven provided quantitative findings. These papers were \nso diverse in terms of their aims and methods that a meta-analysis was not possible. \n \nScope and quality \nIncluded papers covered 16 professional (e.g. health visitors, psychiatrists, \nphysiotherapists) and 20 client populations (e.g. children, cancer patients, elderly, \npatients with cardiac problems). From application of the quality criteria it was apparent \nthat the quality of the papers was generally poor. The main quality limitations (Table 2) \nwere: non-research based papers were low on reference to theory or relevant research \nand did not include critical discussion of alternative viewpoints; qualitative papers were \nlow on description of methods as well as sensitivity to the context; and quantitative \npapers were low on description of methods and information about validity and reliability \nof outcome measures. \n \nThemes and concepts identified from included papers \nThe key issues discussed in the literature related to six broad themes: (i) definitions of \ncaseload management, (ii) caseload measurement and \u2018tools\u2019, (iii) models of caseload \nmanagement practice, (iv) client-professional relationship, (v) discharging, and (vi) \nprofessional guidance. Six papers presented issues that related to but did not fit within \nany of these main themes. These are presented under an additional theme \u2018other \n  10 \nissues\u2019. Papers of higher quality are presented in more detail than those of poorer \nquality. \n \nDefinitions of caseload management \nFive papers focused on defining caseload management. Henke et al15 conceptualised \ncaseload management as a co-ordinating element of providing care to more than one \nclient. They argued that: movement of individual cases through the care process (i.e. \nthroughput) is the essence of effective caseload management and that throughput \nshould be measured at all stages of the care process in order to ensure that individual \ncases progress towards their goals. None of the other papers within this theme \npresented operational definitions for caseload management, but listed caseload \nmanagement decisions and actions16,17 and discussed general aspects of caseload \nmanagement [e.g. employee accountability, cost-effectiveness, professionals\u2019 values18, \nresources19 and prioritisation17\n \n]. The theme was solely based on papers that were not \nresearch-based. There was no evidence of empirical evaluations of throughput. \nCaseload measurement and \u2018tools\u2019 \nThis theme constituted the largest number of papers (n=11) and described caseload \nmeasurement variables20, tools for caseload measurement21-26 and management27-29, \nand a qualitative implementation evaluation30. Caseload measurement covered two \ndimensions: size23 (i.e. a number of cases on professional\u2019s caseload) and \u2018weight\u201920-\n22,24-26 (i.e. size multiplied by case complexity). Caseload weight stemmed from an \nargument that caseload size alone is not a meaningful measure due to differences \n  11 \nbetween individual cases. King et al20\n \n conceptualised a range of variables (e.g. contact \nfrequency, level of need, intervention provided) that could be used to operationalise \ncaseload weight, but presented no evidence of their use in practice. None of the papers \npresented evidence about a relationship between caseload size\/ weight and care \nprocess outcomes. \nPapers that focused on caseload measurement and management tools are summarised \nin table 3. Four of these were built on the assumption that there in an optimum, \nstandardised caseload size or weight. One paper22\n \n challenged this approach, arguing \nthat subjectivity is inevitable in caseload \u2018weighting\u2019 systems because \u2018complexity\u2019 of a \ncase will always be dependent on professional-related factors (e.g. knowledge and \nskills). They claimed that caseload weighting tools should make such subjectivity \ntransparent. \nSeven of the nine tools had emerged from practice21,22,24,25,27-29 and were characterised \nby limited reference to empirical research and limited replicability. The only research-\nbased tool26 provided little information about methods used for its development, and the \nconceptual paper23 presented no evidence of the tool\u2019s use in practice. All nine papers \nsuffered from similar limitations: the tools\u2019 impacts were anecdotally reported as \nadvantageous to therapists and a service manager rather than as improvements in \nservice provision or benefits to clients; none of the tools had been empirically evaluated \nin professional practice; and regarding validity, reliability, effectiveness and acceptability \nto clients of the tool was rarely reported. \n  12 \n \nA final paper30 within this theme discussed implementation and acceptability of caseload \nmanagement tools\n \n. It was identified that tools can have several disadvantages as well \nas advantages, including feelings of anxiety for both professional and clients and \ninterruptions in the client-professional relationship. Although using the tool may have \nincreased consistency between professionals, there was variation in the way \nprofessionals used it, and clients\u2019 perceptions and experiences of the tool were related \nto their perceptions of their relationship with the professional. The importance of \nevaluating consequences and acceptability of caseload management tools to both \nprofessionals and their clients was identified.  \nTo summarise this theme, there are major limitations in the existing knowledge base, \nspecifically, a lack of empirical evidence about the relationships between caseload size\/ \nweight and professionals\u2019 caseload management. The validity, reliability, effectiveness, \nacceptability to professionals and clients, and feasibility of implementing existing tools \nare largely unknown. \n \nModels of caseload management practice \nNine papers described models of caseload management practice. Five of these7,31-34 \ndescribed team-based caseload management systems. A qualitative study31 \ninvestigated \u2018zoning\u2019; a system in which professionals openly reviewed and discussed \neach others\u2019 caseloads in regular team meetings. Zoning aimed to target services to \nthose who needed them the most; ensure clients did not miss out on services they \n  13 \nrequired; and ensure everyone in the team was working coherently. Zoning operated \nthrough three main functions: normative (managerial oversight and adherence to \npolicy), restorative (space for discussion and peer support) and formative (development \nof skills through sharing). Although staff perceptions of zoning were mainly positive, it \nwas reported that increased awareness of difficult cases might generate stress. Some \nprofessionals perceived that limiting resources to only those who needed them was a \nnegative effect of zoning.  \n \nThe other four papers7,32-34 reported that team-based approaches were perceived to \nhave the benefits of sharing knowledge and skills32 and enhanced management of \ncomplicated cases7,34 as these increased a sense of coping and support7. Team \nmeetings were used to identify and agree clients\u2019 health needs32 and it was suggested \nthat agreements at team-level reduce undesired variation in practice between \nprofessionals33. However, another side of reduced variance was perceived to be lower \nlevels of flexibility for individuals\u2019 practices33. Some professionals were reluctant to give \nup individual caseloads, with related concerns about losing relationships with \nclients32,33\n \n. \nWith respect to other models of caseload management practice, Pertile and Page35 \nbriefly described a development of the Maroondah Approach to Caseload Management \n(MACS). This model emerged from practice and was aimed at reducing waiting times \nfor treatment (as opposed to waiting times for assessment). A key element was \nprevention of the carer\u2019s dependency on the professional through carer education. \n  14 \nProfessionals who implemented the MACS36\n \n felt that involving carers was useful. The \nchallenges in implementation included resistance by carers, resources issues and \nincompatibility with some of the current clinical approaches. \nIn \u2018active caseloads\u201937 \u2018active\u2019 status was given to families that had an identified health \nneed, an agreed care plan and a timed evaluation. Management of \u2018inactive\u2019 families \nwas not reported. In \u2018total caseloads\u201938\n \n a professional managed the client\u2019s care process \nfrom assessment to discharge as opposed to a task-oriented approach with a daily list \nof newly allocated clients. \nIn the absence of empirical evaluations, limited conclusions can be drawn about the \npotential effectiveness of these different models of caseload management practice. \nReporting of the feasibility and acceptability of the models was limited. The papers \ndiscussed challenges in changing professionals\u2019 caseload management as well as \nperceived facilitators of change. Five out of nine papers reported perceived benefits of \nteam-based approaches.  \n \nClient-professional relationship \nThe client-professional relationship \u2013theme was the main theme in four papers, but it \nwas also mentioned as a sub-theme in several other paperse.g.30,32,33 included in this \nreview. One of the key concepts frequently linked with this was a \u2018need\u2019. A qualitative \ninvestigation39 reported that professionals\u2019 construction of a need was related to their \nsocial context of practice and personal framework as well as available resources. These \n  15 \nguided their actions in identifying certain needs over others and allocating resources to \ncertain clients.  \n \nAn opinion40 was reported that investing time early in the process (to build the \nrelationship) is helpful and that providing hope is important. A survey41 found that the \nfrequency of therapeutic limit-setting actions was positively correlated with client-related \nfactors (e.g. past history of hospitalisation or substance abuse) and negatively \ncorrelated with professionals\u2019 perceived level of alliance with the client. Another survey42\n \n \nfound that professionals who perceived more client-related barriers to treatment were \nmore likely to employ strategies to overcome the barriers. Both papers suffered from \nquality limitations regarding methods and neither reported investigations of possible \nmechanisms underlying the correlations, direction of any causality or impact on the care \nprocess.  \nDischarging \nDischarging emerged as a key theme from four papers. While covering other issues, \nsome papers described discharging as a particularly challenging stage of the care \nprocess. The concept of need continued to appear as important. An audit43 identified \nthat one of the main reasons for discharging was that professionals no longer perceived \na need for input or that the client was supported by other services. A qualitative study44 \nconcluded that post-discharge support should be planned at early stages of the care \nprocess, but that there were challenges in doing this (e.g. time constraints, difficulties in \nidentifying what was needed). Two further studies45,46 found that in some instances \n  16 \nprofessionals carried out \u2018long-term management\u2019 (e.g. monitoring rather than providing \ntreatment) even when the need for involvement was not clear and it was suggested that \nproviding care had become a habit that was difficult to stop. Professionals\u2019 \ndissatisfaction about meeting clients\u2019 needs was higher with those who had stayed on \ncaseloads for long (>5years)45\n \n. Long-stay clients were perceived to be \u2018stuck\u2019 or difficult \nto discharge. \nProfessional guidance \nThree papers were structured around professional guidance for caseload management. \nThe British Dietetics Association\u2019s safe caseload management guidelines47 focused \nmainly on organisational and contextual issues (e.g. policies and standards). Guidance \nfor individual professionals was at a very general level (e.g. advice to adhere to policies \nand standards). The Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists48 had developed \na draft framework for effective caseload management. The recommendations included \nbroad \u2018guiding principles\u2019 such as combining client-centeredness with evidence-based \npractice; cost-effectiveness; accountability and professional leadership and expertise. \nThe third paper49\n \n noted that professionals must adhere to their code of conduct and that \nthey are personally accountable for their practice. \nOther issues \nA mixed group of papers (n=6) were not able to be classified into the themes described \nabove. These covered contextual issues, cognitive processes, and knowledge and \nskills. Inclusion of these papers in the review was largely a function of the inclusive \n  17 \nsearch strategy. In brief, a survey50 and a conceptual paper51 discussed, respectively, \nthe frequency of various ethical issues faced by professionals when managing client \ncare, and perceived uncertainty and risk of a given situation as factors influencing \nprofessionals\u2019 decisions and actions. Two qualitative research papers52,53 described \nprofessionals\u2019 thinking processes in relation to clinical tasks. Both suggested that \nsituational aspects of decision-making were important. Finally, a survey found that \nrehabilitation counsellors\u2019 caseload management performance (measured as clinical \noutcomes, throughput and use of resources) was positively correlated with their \neducational level54, and a qualitative research study found that newly qualified clinical \npsychologists reported fewer caseload management strategies than experienced \nones55\n \n.  \n4. Discussion of the key issues from the existing literature \nThe 42 included papers indicated high practice-based interest, a lack of research-based \npapers and the absence of a cumulative knowledge base in health and social care \nprofessionals\u2019 caseload management. Papers covered a wide range of professional and \nclient populations, suggesting that caseload management is a concern in a range of \nfields. The quality of the papers was generally poor, and it was not possible to make any \nfirm conclusions. However, inclusion of different types of papers in the review allowed \nidentification of the main problem areas for professional practice. This will inform \npractitioners\u2019, decisions makers\u2019 and researchers\u2019 future endeavors to investigate and \nimprove caseload management as discussed below. \n \n  18 \nKey concepts for future investigation \nSome key concepts that would benefit from further exploration were evidencet in the \nliterature reviewed. One of these was throughput, a concept that has already been \nfound relevant for service-level caseload management in hospital care. One of the \npapers in this review suggested that, in community care, throughput at a service level \ncan be seen as a function of throughput in individual professionals\u2019 caseloads15\n \n. \nFurther, throughput in individual professionals\u2019 caseloads can be seen as a function of \nduration and intensity of care provided to individual clients. Future research should \ninvestigate whether throughput at individual professional -level could provide a useful \napproach to ensuring client flow through community services and, subsequently, \nimproved access to new clients. \nEfficient throughput relies on timely discharging. Yet, in the current review the findings \nsuggested that in some instances professionals continue to provide services to clients \nlonger than clinically needed. One explanation for this could be that discharging \nrequires professionals to make judgements about clients\u2019 needs \u2013 a concept \nemphasised in a number of papers across the themes. In many fields of health care, \nparticularly with clients with long-term conditions, a \u2018need\u2019 (i.e. a condition or an activity \nlimitation) is likely to continue despite interventions. It may not be possible to fully \u2018meet \na need\u2019 (i.e. to cure the condition). In such circumstances, judgements about benefits \nand cost-benefits of continuing interventions would be required. Yet, the included \npapers provided some indication that attempts to consider cost-benefits and provide \nmore targeted services could be perceived negatively by some professionals. Further \n  19 \nwork and debate is required around the role of community services with clients with \nlong-term conditions, and the boundaries that professionals should adhere to when \ndeciding about provision of interventions. The requirement for this is particularly \npertinent in the services where the care is provided by nursing or allied health \nprofessionals as the clinical evidence to guide the decision making process is likely to \nbe limited. \n \nIt can be argued that defining a client\u2019s need, and matching this with the most efficient \nand appropriate intervention strategy, is one of the core aspects of individual \nprofessionals\u2019 daily caseload management. It is therefore not surprising that the review \nidentified a number of caseload management tools that have been developed for \nquantifying clients\u2019 needs, and the subsequent demand of the professionals\u2019 caseload. \nThis approach is underpinned by a concept of \u2018caseload weighting\u2019. This involves \nestablishing the time demand of professionals\u2019 caseload by multiplying the number of \nclients on their caseload by the complexity of the cases\u2019. However, this review identified \na lack of evidence for this approach and for the perception that caseload weighting can \nbe used to improve caseload management and service provision. Further, the majority \nof caseload weighting tools identified in this review shared a fundamental problem: the \nscoring systems to define a \u2018weight\u2019 (e.g. complexity) of a case were not based on \nempirical evidence and their validity and reliability were unknown. This raises a \ndilemma. That is, if no tool is used, professionals\u2019 judgements about variables such as \ncomplexity and time demand are subjective. However, the use of a numeric system can \ncreate a false impression of objectivity, but if their reliability and validity are unknown \n  20 \nthey may be no more objective than clinicians\u2019 (possibly expertise-based) judgements. \nConsequently, the use of tools that may be invalid or unreliable has the potential to \ncreate \u2018hidden bias\u2019 that is not readily open to scrutiny. Considering the amount and \nbreadth of discourse regarding caseload weight, an operationalisable definition of this \nconcept would need to be established and evaluated. Further, possible relationships \nbetween weight and care process outcomes should be further empirically investigated \nbefore a numeric system of caseload management can be reliably and validly used. \n \nImplications for policy \nFuture work in improving caseload management should consider the different levels and \nstakeholders involved, including individual professionals, and interactions between \nthem. Further, in light of a wider evidence in quality improvement56\n \n, it may be that \nfocusing on the complete care process, rather than its discrete dimensions (e.g. needs \nassessment or discharging alone), would be a useful way to provide services with \nevidence about effective models of organising their overall practice. \nThis review found the current guidance for caseload management to be limited by a lack \nof high quality evidence to support the recommendations. Policy makers should allocate \nresources for systematic investigation of the factors related to effective, efficient and \nequitable caseload management in community care, including issues such as \nthroughput, role of professional-client relationships, and ways to achieve satisfactory \ndischarging. High quality evidence of these issues would facilitate development of \nguidelines that were specific to professionals\u2019 practice, and thus more likely to be \n  21 \neffective in improving practice57\n \n. Collection of meaningful routine data about client flow \nand professionals\u2019 activities would provide one, but not the only, approach to the \ndevelopment of such an evidence-base. \nFinally, the current policy discourse encourages service managers and professionals to \nfocus on providing services to those who (clinically) \u2018need\u2019 them. As emphasis in service \nprovision moves increasingly from acute interventions and curing patients to \nmanagement of long-term conditions and maintenance of good health, solely focusing \non needs may no longer be appropriate. Policy makers are in a position to encourage \nmanagers and professionals to consider not only their patients needs but also the likely \nbenefits, and cost-benefits, of the interventions.  \n \nImplications for practice \nThe findings from this review indicate that it is of paramount importance that services \nsystematically critique the validity and reliability of any caseload management tools they \nconsider using, including those that rely on calculating caseload \u2018weights\u2019. The \nacceptability and consequences (both positive and negative) of any tool to the clients \nand professionals should also be considered. There is currently limited evidence to \nsupport services to select the best models of caseload management practice. It may be \nthat team-based approaches have helpful features (e.g. they may encourage sense of \nsupport and sharing of skills), however, further investigation is required before any one \napproach can be recommended.  \n \n  22 \nImplications for researchers \nMethods for the quality appraisal, extraction, analysis and synthesis for mixed methods \nsystematic reviews are still developing. It was acknowledged that the basis for using of \nquality appraisal outcomes to weight the evidence for synthesis is extremely limited and \nfurther consideration is required about how this should be done in mixed-methods \nstudies. \n \nThe key concepts that would benefit from future research have been identified in this \nreview. Other areas of further research include the role of client-professional \nrelationship and team-based approaches in caseload management. In terms of the \nclient-professional relationship, the magnitude and nature of any relationships, and the \nunderlying mechanisms, require further exploration. In terms of the team-based \napproaches, benefits on caseload management outcomes (e.g. access and consistency \nof service provision) and feasibility of use should be further investigated. In order to \nimprove the quality of the evidence in the field, researchers should ensure that in \nreporting the findings they provide a comprehensive description of the methods used, \nspecifically, consideration given to the research context, validity and reliability of \noutcome measures. \n \nLimitations \nQualitative data extraction and formation of themes are, in general, subjective \nprocesses. However, in this review emphasis was placed on transparency of the \nprocess, to enhance the validity of the synthesis. A narrative approach allowed \n  23 \ninvestigation of the broader discourse and inclusion of a range of perspectives into the \nsynthesis, which was particularly valuable in a field where summative knowledge is \nscarce. This review did not aim to establish effectiveness of particular caseload \nmanagement approaches or practices, nor did it investigate organisational aspects of \ncaseload management. Although the focus of this review was at the level of the \nindividual professional, it is acknowledged that professionals make decisions and take \nactions in the context of dyadic relationship with their clients and within variety of team \nand organisational contexts. Therefore, it is likely that there are topics beyond those \nidentified in this review (e.g. tensions between social service and health service \nmanagers and practitioners about service boundaries, staff mix issues, and workload \nand service quality relationships) that are relevant to professionals\u2019 caseload \nmanagement and that would provide a logical expansion for this review in the future. \n \n5. Conclusions and Recommendations \nThe literature about community professionals\u2019 caseload management is mainly \nexperience- (as opposed to research-) based. It is not possible to draw firm conclusions, \nbut key concepts and issues for future research were identified. The use of team-based \napproaches may facilitate effective caseload management processes. There was little \nevidence to support the currently used caseload management tools and models of \ncaseload management practice, and current professional guidance was limited in detail \nand in relevance to daily practice. Services considering implementing caseload \nmanagement tools or models of practice should critically evaluate their evidence-base; \npolicy makers should ensure guidance provided is specific; and researchers should \n  24 \nbuild a cumulative knowledge-base including evidence about the main variables that \npredict effective, efficient and equitable caseload management. \n \n \n"}
