Introduction \n \n In 2000, the Conclusions of the presidency of the Lisbon European Council established the goal \nof making the European Union the \u201cmost competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the \nworld.\u201d In so doing, they explicitly acknowledged the gap separating the EU from the present world \nleader \u2013 the USA \u2013 and announced their intention to catch up within a ten-year period. A year earlier, \nthe President of the United States had set the goal of \u201cmaintaining world leadership in science, \nmathematics, and engineering\u201d (NTSC 1999). Nowadays, more than half a decade later, US leadership \nis still undisputed and \u2013 as highlighted by the International R&D scoreboard published by the UK \nDepartment of Trade and Industry in October 2006 \u2013 the transatlantic technology gap has widened. \nThough there are limitations of the available proxies for innovative output, all standard \nindicators reveal a significant disadvantage in the innovative capacity of the European Union. When \nconsidering scientific activity, such as the number of scientific publications and citations weighted by \npopulation (as reported in Dosi et al. 2006 using OECD data), the output gap between the EU-15 and \nthe US is immediately apparent, with 4.64 publications per thousand inhabitants in the US vs. 3.6 in the \nEU-15 in the 1997-2001 period. This gap is even wider when the impact of such scientific production is \nassessed in terms of article citations (39.75 per thousand inhabitants in the US against 23.03 in the EU-\n15) or shares in the top 1% most cited publications (0.09 top 1% publications per thousand inhabitants \nin the US against 0.04 in the EU-15). When considering technological output, the United States shows \nthe best innovative performance, as measured by its share of the total triadic patent families1 (36.4% in \n2003 against the 30.3% of the EU). When triadic patent families are weighted by population, US patent \nintensity is 47% higher than for the EU-15 and almost double that of the EU-25 (our calculations based \non OECD 2006).  \nIn spite of the magnitude of this innovation gap and the political emphasis attached to it on both \nsides of the Atlantic, very little systematic comparative analysis has been pursued on its causes. \n                                                 \n1\n \u201cA patent is a member of the triadic patent families if and only if it has been applied for and filed at the European Patent \nOffice (EPO), at the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) and if it has been granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office \n(USPTO)\u201d (Eurostat 2006: 6). Patent families are supposed to improve international comparability by suppressing the home \nadvantage. \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n4 \nExisting analyses have mainly addressed the differences between the two continents in terms of the \nmajor \u2018inputs\u2019 to innovation, such as R&D investments, the level of human capital accumulation, the \nstructure of the educational system and the capacity to generate and retain top-level scientists. Other \nanalyses emphasise the ways that organisational and institutional settings shape the use of such \ninnovative inputs. Thus, unequal inputs to the process of innovation, together with different systems of \ninnovation, form the core of existing explanations of the innovation output-gap. \nEven though these factors account for a large part of differential innovative performance, it \nstands to reason that their spatial organisation may also play a role. The spatial organisation of the \nsources of innovation determines levels of localised economies of scale and localised knowledge \nexternalities, and may in this way affect the level of innovative output. Studies of the geography of \ninnovation have indeed emphasised agglomeration of innovation inputs, proximity effects, and \nknowledge spillovers. Much less attention has been devoted to the dynamic process through which \nagglomeration and specialization are constructed and reconstructed over time, through the spatial \nmobility and matching of innovative factors. This process, or flow, gives rise to specific levels and \ntypes of proximity and spillovers.  \nThis paper aims to fill the gap by focusing on the \u2018territorial dynamics of innovation\u2019 in the EU \nand the USA. These two areas of the world are characterised by a different historical geography of \ninnovation systems (where the public and private actors have been created and how they have been \ncoordinated over distance). Behind such histories, we argue, there are different contemporary \ninstitutions, rules, and incentives governing the creation and geographical mobility and combination of \nsuch inputs to innovation. In order to analyse the geographical processes underlying innovation, this \npaper builds a model, which considers these territorial dynamics in conjunction with the factors \nevaluated in standard models. The analysis shows that the higher mobility of capital, population, and \nknowledge in the economically- and culturally-integrated US market enables combinations of factors \nthat respond rapidly to shifts of the technological frontier, and allow full exploitation of local innovative \nactivities and (informational) synergies. In the European Union, by contrast, imperfect market \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

Structural determinants of the innovation gap: a review \n \nThe innovation output gap between Europe and the USA is most frequently attributed to \ndifferences in inputs to innovation production. The quantity and quality of inputs, as well as the broader \n\u2018innovative infrastructure\u2019 in the two contexts \u2013 by reflecting their cultural, institutional, and economic \ndiversity \u2013 are indeed substantially greater in the United States.  \nFirst, the total amount of the resources devoted to innovative activities varies significantly. In \n2004, 1.9% of GDP was spent on Research and Development in the EU-25 (1.95% in the EU-15) \n(Eurostat 2006a) compared to 2.6% of GDP (NSF 2006) for the US. Furthermore, the nature of such \nexpenditure differs considerably. On the one hand, as Dosi et al. (2006) point out, \u201cthe usual claim \nconcerning the higher share of publicly funded R&D in the EU as compared to the US is simply \ngroundless\u201d(p.1456): government financed R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 0.66% in the \nEU-25 against 0.70% in the US (in 2003 and 2004 respectively). However, a large percentage of this \nUS public expenditure is for R&D carried out by private firms, about double the corresponding figure \nin the EU. American private firms not only benefit from a larger share of public funds than their EU \ncounterparts, they also devote a higher proportion of their internal resources to R&D. Industry-financed \nR&D expenditure is about 1.9% of GDP in the US (NSF 2006), but only around 1% of GDP in the EU \n(Eurostat 2006a).  \n Second, the gap in human resources devoted to R&D is large and significant: \u201cin 2003, the \nnumber of researchers (in full-time equivalents) per thousand of the labour force amounted to only 5.4 \nin the EU against 10.1 in Japan and 9.0 in the US. This EU deficit is mainly located in the business \nsector\u201d (European Commission 2005: 6). Furthermore the advantage of the US in this area is not only \n\u2018quantitative\u2019 but also \u2018qualitative\u2019, as the US attracts and retains a large proportion of high impact \nresearchers: of the top 1,222 most cited individuals in 14 scientific fields, 66% live and work in the US, \nwhile only 20% are from the sum of the EU countries (Batty 2003). \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis. Journal of economic geography, 7 (6). pp. 673-709. ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n6 \nThis situation in the research sector reflects a more general trend in human-capital \naccumulation, which, in turn, is the result of different structures and levels of investment in the \neducational system. In 2004, only 34.1% of all 20 year olds were enrolled in higher education in the \nEU-25 (and 33.4% in the Euro zone), in comparison to 46.2% in the US (European Commission \n2005b). Furthermore, public and private investment in education is significantly higher in the US than \nin the EU: in 2003 the expenditure per student in Higher Education \u2013 adding public and private \nexpenditure \u2013 was just 39.3% that of the US in the EU-25 and 41.1% in the Euro zone2 (Eurostat data). \nThe combination of higher US investment in higher education with existing gaps in R&D investment \nand in the capacity to generate, attract, and retain top scientists is reflected in a growing gap in the \nstanding and influence between American and European universities. According to the ranking \nproduced by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, among the top 20 universities in the world 17 are in the \nUS and only two in the EU (both in the UK) 3 (Institute for Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong \nUniversity 2006). \nThe two continents also show marked differences in the institutions and policies governing the \ninvention, development, and adoption of new technologies. \u201cThe foundations of the US \u2018national \nsystem of innovation\u2019 were largely put in place during 1945-1950 (when) demobilization for peace was \nreplaced by Cold War rearmament\u201d (Mowery 1998: 640). In contrast, despite the recent and rapid \nformal institutional-building efforts at EU level, there is yet no analogous Europe-wide system in place, \ni.e. which could complement and integrate existing national systems in the way the US institutions do \n(Gregersen and Johnson 1997; Borr\u00e1s 2004; Stein 2004). While the US\u2019s integrated (though \ndecentralized) system was forged by the implementation of consistent innovation policies with large-\nscale federally-funded projects largely benefiting private firms and basic research, the European \ninnovation system still suffers from fragmented, small-scale projects and highly bureaucratic \ngovernment policies. As a result, the US national innovation system seems oriented towards \n                                                 \n2\n \u20ac 8,049.5 in the EU-25 and \u20ac 8,422.6 in the Euro Zone vs. \u20ac 20,487 in the US, measured in PPS, based on full-time \nequivalents. \n3\n When the ranking is extended to the top 100 universities we find that 57 are in the USA and 35 in the EU (of which 11 in \nthe UK). The ranking of the top 500 universities in the world is based upon a variety of performance indicators (see \nhttp:\/\/ed.sjtu.edu.cn\/rank\/2005\/ARWU%202005.pdf for further details). \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n7 \ntechnological \u2018shifting\u2019 rather than \u2018deepening\u2019: radical innovations are more easily achieved in the US, \nbecause it is capable of rapidly reallocating resources in line with the requirements of new \ntechnological paradigms (Ergas 1987). The \u2018shifting\u2019 capacity of the US system is supported by the way \nits research universities develop complex interactions with the world of business. Furthermore the \nantitrust and intellectual property regulatory frameworks seem to offer a fertile environment for the \nmarketing of new technologies4 (Hart 2004). This generally more favourable business environment \nallows a more effective adjustment of the sectoral structure of the economy with the prompt start-up of \nnew firms in response to new market opportunities in emerging sectors. The higher degree of \nspecialisation in R&D intensive sectors and the stronger presence of small and medium-sized R&D \nintensive firms in the national market (Smith 2007) are both causes and consequences of the US \n\u2018shifting\u201d capacity, in a circular process supported by the intrinsically different system of innovation \nconditions. Conversely, EU firms, on average, have weaker entrepreneurial culture and greater \nresistance to organizational change (Delmas 2002). Major constraints also arise from barriers to the \naccess to venture capital (a major source of funds for US innovation) and European labour market rules, \nwhich frequently lead to mismatches between staffing patterns and the true demand for skills, since they \nslow down recomposition of staff in response to technology and market shifts. \nAll these factors directly influence innovative performance. But in addition to this, they also \nlead to different patterns of spatial organisation of innovation in each continent. As we will argue in the \nnext section, these territorial dynamics further differentiate the rate and direction of innovation in the \nUS and the EU.  \n \n3. Geography and innovative performance in the EU and the US \n \n The spatial distribution of innovative output in both Europe and in the United States, as proxied \nby patents, exhibits a strong tendency towards disproportionate concentration in a few locations: \n\u201cduring the 1990s, 92 percent of all patents were granted to residents of metropolitan areas, although \n                                                 \n4\n Though the effects of the 1982 patenting system reform are debated (see Jaffe and Lerner 2004). \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n8 \nthese areas account for only about three-quarters of the US population, and for about 20 percent of land \narea of the continental United States\u201d (Carlino et at. 2001: 1). In the EU, patenting is \u2018highly \nconcentrated\u2019 as well (Eurostat 2006b). The cumulative percentage of total patents recorded by the 100 \nmost innovative EU-15 regions and US MSAs (Figure 1) is similar in the two continents and in both \ncontexts the twenty most innovative regions account for around 70% of total patents. \n \n[Insert Fig.1 approximately here] \n \nThe literature on the geographical determinants of innovation in the two continents has focused on the \nrole of agglomeration and the density of economic interactions as the key catalysers of innovation. \nAgglomeration and density are indeed relevant forces behind a variety of economic processes. As \nillustrated by Ciccone and Hall (1996), average labour productivity is significantly greater where \nemployment density is higher. In line with this approach, different studies have found that \nagglomeration increases innovative output even after controlling for differences in human capital, \nhigh-tech industry structure and R&D university infrastructure, both in the US (Carlino et al. 2004; \nSedgley and Elmslie 2004) and in some EU countries (e.g. Andersson et al. 2005, for the case of \nSweden). As Ciccone (2002) points out, the \u201cagglomeration effects in European countries (France, \nGermany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) are only slightly lower than in the US and do not vary \nsignificantly across countries\u201d (p.214). Agglomeration influences economic outputs and innovative \nperformance through a mix of different sources of Marshallian agglomeration economies (labour \nmarket interactions, linkages between intermediate and final good suppliers, knowledge spillovers) \nthat is present in each place5. Following Duranton and Puga (2003), the forces behind agglomeration \neconomies can be broken down into \u2018sharing\u2019 (e.g. sharing of indivisible facilities, gains from variety \nof input suppliers), \u2018matching\u2019, and \u2018learning\u2019 mechanisms. The creation, accumulation, and diffusion \n                                                 \n5\n Duranton and Puga (2003) use as an example a model \u201cin which agglomeration facilitates the matching between firms and \ninputs. These inputs may be labelled workers, intermediates, or ideas. Depending on the label chosen, a matching model of \nurban agglomeration economies could be presented as a formalisation of either one of Marshall\u2019s three basic sources of \nagglomeration economies even though it only captures a single mechanism\u201d (p.2) \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis. Journal of economic geography, 7 (6). pp. 673-709. ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n9 \nof knowledge also rely upon different types of coordination enabled by face-to-face contacts (Storper \nand Venables 2004). Close proximity thus becomes a condition for the dissemination of information, \nwhich would otherwise be impossible or too expensive to codify (Charlot and Duranton 2006).  \nFrom an empirical perspective, it is however difficult to isolate the learning, matching, and \nsharing components of agglomeration. Empirical analysts have thus had to rely upon indirect (output) \nmeasurements of learning and proximity \u2013 notably the geography of patenting \u2013 as a means to \ndistinguish informational spillovers from the other \u2018Marshallian forces\u2019 (Fujita and Thisse 2002). \nAlong these lines, research has established a connection between density and patenting, where density \nis a proxy for agglomeration and patenting for learning. \n Yet a simple dense\/not dense dichotomy does not adequately capture the potential complexity \nof the geography of matching and learning processes. Knowledge matching and learning are logical \noutcomes of the many ways in which agents move, signal, and match to other agents. This means not \njust \u2018being\u2019 in established patterns of proximity to other agents, but also the dynamic process by which \nsuch densities and proximities are achieved, and how they adjust over time. Such adjustments refer to \nthe types of agents (who they are and what they bring to the innovation process), in relation to \nchanging technologies, markets, and types of knowledge required to innovate. We call these \u2018flow\u2019 \ndimensions of the problem the \u2018territorial dynamics of innovation\u2019 and view its analysis as a \ncomplement to what the literature has to say on levels of density, proximity, and innovation.  \nLet us now consider these geographical processes and their socio-institutional underpinnings in \ngreater detail. First of all, rather than thinking of agglomerations one by one, it is helpful to consider \ntheir interrelations and connections to other places. Even similarly \u2018dense\u2019 economic fabrics may be \nexposed to external knowledge flows to different degrees, with different levels of knowledge \nspillovers from neighbouring areas. Even if the use of tacit and highly specialised knowledge is \nmaximised in the \u2018core\u2019 of dense agglomerations, some of that knowledge travels more widely \n(Anselin et al. 1997; Varga 2000; \u00c1cs 2002; Sonn and Storper 2008, for the US, and Bottazzi and Peri \n2003; Greunz 2003; Crescenzi 2005; Moreno et al. 2005a ; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Crescenzi 2008, for \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis. Journal of economic geography, 7 (6). pp. 673-709. ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n10 \nthe EU case). This means that core regions may potentially benefit from proximity to other innovative \nneighbourhoods, such that they form a wider network structure through which knowledge flows are \ntransmitted. Inter-agglomeration knowledge flows are different in the two continents. The higher \naverage population density of the EU, with major metropolitan areas relatively closer together than in \nthe United States (where instead metropolitan areas are farther away from one another), may allow a \nstronger continent-wide circulation of knowledge, and possibly limit the distance decay of useful \nknowledge.  \nIn addition, an agglomeration is not merely a stock of resources; it has a dynamic, consisting of \nthe flow of resources into and out of it (a \u2018churn\u2019 or turnover). Migration flows contribute to the \ncreation of new knowledge at the local level, by \u2018increasing\u2019 the density of the local skill pool and \nchanging its quality, in terms of the variety of skills and cultures it may contain (De Blasio 2005; \nOttaviano and Peri 2006). In the most innovative places, we expect migration to update the matching \nof knowledge, skills, and competencies in line with the evolution of the technological frontier. On the \ncontrary, where agglomerations are less often re-composed through migration, innovative agents may \nbenefit from proximity relationships but find it more difficult to dynamically match existing agents to \nnew knowledge producers. Migration trends are crucially influenced by the costs of mobility \u2013 in turn \naffected by issues such as culture, identity, or social and personal links \u2013 and by institutional \nincentives to labour mobility, which are very different in the US and Europe. The degree of (domestic) \nlabour mobility is substantially higher in the United States than in the EU, as extensively documented \nby Zimmermann (1995 and 2005), Vandamme (2000), and Puhani (2001),for the EU6 and by Peri \n(2005) in a comparative perspective, and there are considerable differences in foreign in-migration as \nwell. \n Third, these forces that influence the composition and recomposition of clusters and \nagglomerations may affect the nature and level of innovation through the types of knowledge they \n                                                 \n6\n Zimmermann (2005) points out that the EU shows \u201ca split labour market that is characterized by high levels of \nunemployment for low-skilled people and a simultaneous shortage of skilled workers. This lack of flexible high-skilled \nworkers and the aging process has created the image of an immobile labour force and the eurosclerosis phenomenon (thus \npreventing) the best allocation of resources and hence economic efficiency\u201d (p.448). \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

If they generate increasing specialisation, then they will likely foster MAR (Marshall-Arrow-\nRomer) externalities within the same industry; if, on the other hand, they promote diversity, they allow \nlocal actors to benefit from knowledge base complementarities and across-industry exchange of ideas \n(Jacobian externalities). The empirical literature suggests that both MAR (Glaeser et al. 1992; \nHenderson 1999) and Jacobian externalities (Feldman and Audretsch 1999; Carlino et al. 2001; \nAndersson et al. 2005) play an important role in fostering innovation, but they do so in different \nsectors. Henderson et al. (1995) find that Jacobs-type externalities prevail in high-tech and MAR in \ncapital goods industries. Duranton and Puga (2001) suggest that agglomeration economies play roles \nin innovation at different phases of the product life cycle: firms develop new products in diversified \ncreative urban contexts, subsequently relocating to specialised cities in the mass production phase in \norder to exploit cost advantages. Where the broader historical, institutional, and political forces inhibit \nmobility, they could prevent the cluster from adjusting in such a way that the most efficient \ncombination of the two types of external economies is maintained, thus hampering innovative \nproductivity. This could be the case of Europe, where incomplete economic integration, \u2018national\u2019 \nredundancies, and duplications in economic structures may have lead to a suboptimal pattern of \nspecialisation. \nFinally, the territorial dynamics of innovation is deeply rooted in a complex institutional \nprocess that shapes the capacities and attitudes of the population toward innovation, and distribute \nthese populations in geographical space (Morgan 1997). These capacities and attitudes can be captured \nempirically as the \u2018social filters\u2019 of the local population, i.e. characteristics of people that either favour \nor deter the development of successful regional innovation systems (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 1999: 82).  \n \n \n4.

Though our research questions differ from the existing literature in that we focus \nupon the \u2018territorial dynamics of innovation\u2019 in the two continents, our use of the knowledge production \nfunction is very similar to them. All this literature, including the present study, is constrained by the \nlimited availability of comparable data at the sub-national level for the US and the EU.

Their \nstrength is to provide comparable information on inventions across a broad range of technological \nsectors. However, patent indicators suffer from a number of limitations in their ability to proxy \ninnovation, and hence must be interpreted with care. Such limitations include the heterogeneous value \nor degree of novelty of patented products or processes; the different propensity to patent across \ncountries and sectors; and the non-patentability of many inventions or the better cost-effectiveness of \nother protection methods (e.g. secrecy) (OECD 2001; Sedgley and Elmslie 2004). Moreover, for the \nUnited States, even ostensibly minor changes in the organisation of patenting institutions, by altering \nthe structure of incentives of all participants in the patenting process (applicants, patent office \nemployees, potential imitators), have produced a substantial inflation in the number of patent \napplications without any underlying \u2018real\u2019 change in inventive performance (Jaffe and Lerner 2004). \nDespite all these caveats, \u00c1cs and Audretsch (1989) show that regression analyses based on patent \ncounts deliver results highly comparable with those based on more direct measures of innovation, thus \nallowing us to consider the growth rate of patents as an effective proxy for changes in local innovative \nperformance. Furthermore, the use of European Patent Office and U.S.Patent Office patent data for \ncomparative analysis has become common practice in both policy documents (E.g. European \nCommission 2005a and 2007) and academic work (Dosi et al. 2006), even though Criscuolo and \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis. Journal of economic geography, 7 (6). pp. 673-709. ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n15 \nVerspagen (2006) have highlighted the intrinsic differences between the two sources when pursuing \nmore complex analyses, such as patent citation analysis.  \nInitial level of patents per million inhabitants \u2013 The initial level of utility8 patents granted\/applied for9 \nin the region is a proxy for the existing technological capacity of the area and its distance from the \ntechnological frontier. This variable also controls for the differential overall propensity to patent, which \nreflects different initial sectoral specialisation patterns. \nR&D expenditure \u2013 is the investment in R&D as a percentage of GDP (R&D intensity). The value of \nR&D intensity expresses the relative innovative effort of a region. It is the main input in the knowledge \nproduction function.  \nSpillovers \u2013 In the knowledge production function, inter-territorial spillovers contribute to the creation \nof new local knowledge. For this purpose, we have developed a measure of the \u2018innovative activities\u2019 \n(in terms of R&D expenditure) that can be \u2018reached\u2019 from each region at a \u2018cost\u2019 which increases with \ndistance. Consequently, for each region the R&D expenditure recorded in neighbouring regions is \nweighted by the inverse of their bilateral distances.  \nThe proxy Spillxi for spillovers from variable xi flowing into region i is calculated as: \n\u2211\n\u2211=\nj ij\nij\nj\nji\nd\nd\nxSpillx 1\n1\n=\n\u2211\n\u2211\nj\nij\nj\nijj\nd\ndx\n jx \u2260\u2200                        (3) \nwhere xi is the variable under analysis, dij is the average trip-length (in minutes)\/distance between \nregion i and j. The amount of knowledge flowing from outside the region is thus proxied by the average \nmagnitude of all other regions\u2019 R&D expenditure weighted by the inverse of the bilateral time-distance. \nThe use of distance-weights over the whole EU territory (rather than simple contiguity weights) \n                                                 \n8\n The majority of patents issued by the USPTO are utility (i.e. invention) patents. Other types of patents and patent \ndocuments issued by USPTO, but not included in this report, are plant patents, design patents, statutory invention \nregistration documents, and defensive publications. While in 1999 the number of utility patents granted reached 153,493, \njust 14,732 design patents, 448 reissue, and 421 plant patents were awarded. Our data do not include these other categories. \n9\n The USPTO provides data at the sub-state level on utility patents granted from 1990 - 1999 with a first-named inventor \nwho resided in the United States. For the EU, instead, patents are organized by EUROSTAT according to the application \nyears rather than the grant years. However, the US patent data at the national level show that the numbers of patent \napplications and patents granted are highly correlated over time (0.94 for the period 1989-2002) and across geographical \nunits (0.98 for 1990). \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n16 \nminimizes the potential bias not only due to the heterogeneity in the number of neighbours of each \nregion but also due to the effect of the EU borders. \nFor the EU the measure of distance is based on the travel time calculated by the IRPUD (2000) \nfor the computation of peripherality indicators and made available by the European Commission10. We \nchose road distance11, rather than straight line distance, as, in particular on a smaller scale, it provides a \nmore realistic representation of the real \u2018cost\u2019 of interaction and contacts across space. However for the \nUS, this kind of distance measure is not available and we are forced to rely on straight line distance12. \nKrugman Index \u2013 Following Midelfart-Knarvik et al. (2002) we call the index K the Krugman \nspecialisation index, used to measure the specialisation of local employment by calculating: \na) for each region, the share of industry k in that region\u2019s total employment: )(tki\u03bd ; \nb) the share of the same industry in the employment of all other regions: )(tki\u03bd ; and \nc) the absolute values of the difference between these shares, added over all industries: \n))()(()( ttabstK kik\nk\nii \u03bd\u03bd \u2212= \u2211  with )(\/)()( txtxt ij\nk\nikij\nk\ni\nk\ni \u2211\u2211\u2211 \u2260\u2260=\u03bd      (4) \nThe index takes the value zero if region i has an industrial structure identical to the rest of the EU\/US \nregions, and takes the maximum value of two if it has no industries in common with the rest of the \nEU\/US. For the US, the Krugman Index has been calculated on the basis of the industry classification \nsystem developed for the 1990 census13 which consists of 235 categories for employed persons, \nclassified into 13 major industry groups. For the EU, we rely on the Branch Accounts ESA95 data for \nemployment in NUTS1 and 2 regions, which are based on a 17-branch classification of economic \nactivities (NACE Rev. 1.1 A17) available from 1995 onwards. \n                                                 \n10\n As the time distance-matrix is calculated either at the NUTS1 or at the NUTS2 level, in order to make it coherent with our \ndata which combine different NUTS levels we relied on the NUTS distance matrix using the NUTS 2 regions with the \nhighest population density in order to represent the corresponding NUTS1 level for Belgium, Germany, and the UK.  \n11\n The distance matrix does not take into account the impact of railway and\/or air connections on the average trip length. \nOnly road  travel-time is available for the EU regions. \n12\n Data on distances between MSAs are calculated on the assumption that a 1 degree difference in latitude is constant \nregardless of the latitude being examined. This assumption is not problematic for smaller countries, but for a large country \nlike the US, it may result in an underestimation of the distance between Southern cities and an overestimation of that \nbetween Northern cities. \n13\n The 1990 census classification was developed from the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual published by \nthe Office of Management and Budget Executive Office of the President. \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n17 \nSocial Filter \u2013 The literature suggests three principal aspects of the \u2018social filter\u2019 of a region: \neducational achievements (Lundvall 1992; Malecki 1997), productive employment of human resources, \nand demographic structure (Fagerberg et al. 1997; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose 1999). A set of variables proxies for \neach domain (given data availability at the regional level and comparability between the EU and the \nUS). Educational attainment is measured by the percentage of population and labour force having \ncompleted tertiary education. Participation in lifelong learning programmes is used as a measure for the \naccumulation of skills at the local level for the EU, while for the US we use the number of people who \ncompleted \u2018some college (or associate) level education but no degree\u2019 and the number of people with \n\u2018bachelor\u2019s, graduate or professional degrees\u201914. \nFor the second area (structure of productive resources), the percentage of the labour force \nemployed in agriculture was available for both the EU and the US. Long-term unemployment is only \navailable for the EU, thus requiring us to use the US unemployment rate (rather than its long term \ncomponent). These two variables are used because of the traditionally low productivity of agricultural \nemployment in relationship to that of other sectors, and because agricultural employment, in particular \nin some peripheral regions of the EU but also in some southern states of the US, is in reality \nsynonymous to \u2018hidden unemployment\u201915. The rate of unemployment (and in the case of the EU \nespecially its long-term component) is an indicator of the rigidity of the labour market and of the \npresence of individuals whose possibilities of being involved in productive work are hampered by \ninadequate skills (Gordon 2001). Demographic structure is indicated by the percentage of population \naged between 15 and 24, with the substantive goal of identifying dynamic demographic trends. Young \npeople contribute towards the renewal of the local society, which should influence the collective \nattitude towards innovation and social change in general.  \n                                                 \n14\n The first category includes people whose highest level of schooling is an associate degree (for example: AA, AS) or some \ncollege credit, but no degree. The second group includes those whose highest level of schooling is a bachelor's degree (for \nexample: BA, AB, BS), a master's degree (for example: MA, MS, MEng, MEd, MSW, MBA); or a professional degree (for \nexample: MD, DDS, DVM, LLB, JD) (US Census Bureau). \n15\n Unemployment is \u2018hidden\u2019 in the fabric of very small farmholdings in many EU peripheral areas and in many Southern \nstates of the US (Demissie 1990; Caselli and Coleman 2001). In both these contexts agricultural workers show low levels of \nformal education, scarce mobility, and tend to be aged.  \n \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

The eigenanalysis of the correlation matrix shows that the first principal \ncomponent alone is able to account for around 39% and 34% of the total variance for the EU and US \ncase, respectively, with an eigenvalue significantly larger than 1 in both cases (Table B-1). \nThe first principal component scores are computed from the standardised value of the original \nvariables by using the coefficients listed under PC1 in Table B-2. These coefficients assign a large \nweight to the educational achievements of the population in both continents; this is a major component \nof the \u2018social filter\u2019 part of our model. In the EU, educational achievement, employed people and, to a \nlesser extent, the participation in life-long learning programmes complete the index with a positive \nweight. Both in the EU and the US a positive weight is also assigned to the percentage of young people, \nbut it is significantly more important in the US. A negative weight is assigned, in both contexts, to the \nrate of unemployment (US) and to its long term component (EU). The percentage of agricultural labour \nhas a negative influence in the EU, while in the US, it has a small but positive influence on the \nmagnitude of the index16. \nAgglomeration and economies of scale- The degree of agglomeration of the local economy is proxied \nby the log of population density, as customary in the literature. In addition, the presence of regional \neconomies of scale is proxied by the relative concentration of economic activities (regional percentage \nof national GDP). \n                                                 \n16\n We are aware of the potential endogeneity arising from the introduction of the social filter variable into the Knowledge \nProduction Function. An effective strategy in order to address this issue would imply the use of several time lags of the \nsocial filter variables as instruments in an instrumental variables framework. However, due to the constraints on data \navailability discussed before, we are forced to limit ourselves to considering the value of this indicator at the beginning of \nthe period of analysis, while assessing the patent growth rate over subsequent years.   \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n19 \nMigration \u2013 The degree of internal (EU17 and US) labour mobility is reflected by the regional rate of \nmigration (i.e. the increase or decrease of the population due to migration flows as a percentage of the \ninitial population). A positive rate of migration (i.e. an inflow of people from other regions) is a proxy \nfor the capacity of the region to attract new workers, thus increasing the size of its labour pool and its \n\u2018diversity\u2019 in terms of skills and cultural background.  \n \n5. Results of the analysis \n \n5.1 Estimation issues, data availability, and units of analysis \n \nWe estimate the model by means of heteroskedasticity-consistent OLS (Ordinary Least Square) \nregressions18. The effect of spatial autocorrelation (i.e. the lack of independence among the error terms \nof neighbouring observations) is minimized by including a set of national dummy variables for the EU \ncase and a set of geographical dummies for the US, accounting for the \u2018national fixed effect\u2019. \nFurthermore, by introducing spatially lagged variables in our analysis, we explicitly consider the \ninteractions between neighbouring regions and thus minimize their effect on the residuals. Another \nconcern is endogeneity, which we address by incorporating the value of the explanatory variables into \nthe model as a mean over the period (t-T-5) \u2013 (t-T), while the average growth rate of patents was \ncalculated over the period from t-T to t. In addition, in order to resolve the problem of different \naccounting units, explanatory variables are expressed, for each region, as a percentage of the respective \nGDP or population.  \n                                                 \n17\n Migration data are provided by Eurostat in the \u2018Migration Statistics\u2019 collection. However there are no data for Spain and \nGreece. Consequently, in order to obtain a consistent measure across the various countries included in the analysis, we \ncalculate this variable from demographic statistics. \u201cData on net migration can be retrieved as the population change plus \ndeaths minus births. The net migration data retrieved in this way also includes external migration\u201d (Puhani 2001: 9). The net \nmigration was standardised by the average population, obtaining the net migration rate. Consequently, while for the EU it is \nimpossible to distinguish between national, intra-EU, and extra-EU migration flows, for the US domestic in-migration and \nout-migration data consist of moves where both the origins and destinations are within the United States. \n18\n Different estimation techniques have been considered in order to minimize potential bias due to omitted variables (panel \ndata) and\/or modifiable aerial unit problem (e.g. Hierarchical Linear Models, HLM). However, severe constraints in terms of \nboth the spatial scale and the time-series dimension of the existing regional data prevent us from implementing these \nalternative methodologies. Further research in this direction remains in our agenda, given the continuous progress in the \navailability of regional statistics.  \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

The analysis is based upon 266 MSA\/CMSAs19 \ncovering all continental US States (and the District of Columbia), while MSAs in Alaska, Hawaii, or in \nother non mainland territories of the US are excluded from the analysis. The lack of sub-state level data \nfor R&D expenditure was addressed by relying upon Standard & Poor\u2019s Compustat20 North American \nfirm-level data which provide a proxy for private R&D expenditure in 145 MSAs out of the total of \n266. The proxy was calculated by summing up firms\u2019 R&D expenditure in each MSA. Though rough, \nthis is the only measure available and similar proxies have been commonly used in the literature on the \nMSA innovative activities (e.g. Feldman 1994). All other US variables are based on US-Census data \nincluded in the USA Counties 1998 CD-Rom. \nFor the EU, the model is run for 1990-2002. Lack of data led to the exclusion of the new \nmember states of the Union. This is actually fortuitous, because the new, central and eastern European \nmember states have much lower development levels than the EU-15 and are less economically \nintegrated with them. In order to maximise the comparability between the EU and the US \u2018territorial \ndynamics of innovation\u2019 the analysis would ideally be focused on FURs (Functional Urban Regions)21 \nrather than on NUTS administrative regions. Unfortunately, the lack of available data for many of the \nrelevant explanatory variables has prevented any consideration of functional regions. For purposes of \nour analysis, the most appropriate scale of analysis seems to be the one closest to each regional system \nof innovation. Hence \u2013 and considering data availability \u2013 the unit of analysis with the greatest \nrelevance in term of the institutional infrastructures that support the proves of innovation was selected \nfor each country. Consequently, the analysis uses NUTS1 regions for Belgium and Germany 22 and \n                                                 \n19\n The MSA\/CMSA list is based on Metropolitan Areas and Components, 1993, with FIPS Codes, published by the Office of \nManagement and Budget (1993). \n20\n Standard & Poor\u2019s Compustat North America is a database of financial, statistical, and market information covering \npublicly traded companies in the U.S. and Canada. It provides more than 340 annual and 120 quarterly income statements, \nbalance sheets, flows of funds, and supplemental data items on more than 10,000 active and 9,700 inactive companies.  \n21\n The concept of FURs has been defined as a means to minimize the bias introduced by commuting patterns. A FUR \nincludes a core city, where employment is concentrated, and its hinterland, from which people commute to the center. For a \ndetailed analysis of this concept see Cheshire and Hay (1989). \n22\n The NUTS2 level corresponds to Provinces for Belgium and  to Regierungsbezirke for Germany.

Countries without \nequivalent sub-national regions (Denmark23, Ireland, Luxembourg) were excluded a priori from the \nanalysis24. In addition, regional data on R&D expenditure are not available in the Eurostat databank for \nSweden, while data on both R&D and patent applications for the UK are so patchy over the period \nconsidered as to prevent their inclusion into the analysis. The entire dataset of the EU is based on \nEUROSTAT Regio data. Table A-1 in the appendix provides a detailed definition of the variables \nincluded in the analysis for both the US and the EU. \nThe use as unit of analysis of NUTS1 and 2 regions for the EU and MSAs for the US could \nproduce distortions in the comparative analysis. While the former cover the whole EU territory, the \nlatter correspond to the main US urban areas and their functional hinterlands, making them not \nnecessarily spatially contiguous. In part, this difference reflects the lower population densities in the \nUS, where more of the territory is truly outside of the direct influence of metropolitan areas than in \nEurope. In the denser US states, such as Connecticut, the entire territory is covered by metropolitan \nareas, making it more like Europe. In any case, the robustness of our results against this potential source \nof bias has been confirmed when reproducing the contiguity structure of the EU NUTS regions by the \nestimation of the same model with the US states as geographical units of analysis. \n \n5.2 Results \nThe results for model (2) are presented in Tables 1 and 2 for the US and Table 3 for the EU.

Trentino-\nAlto Adige (IT31) has no correspondent in the NUTS2003 classification. Due to the nature of the analysis, the islands (PT2 \nA\u00e7ores, PT3 Madeira, FR9 D\u00e9partements d\u2019Outre-mer, ES7 Canarias) and Ceuta y Melilla (ES 63) were not considered, as \ntime-distance information, necessary for the computation of spatially lagged variables, is not available.  \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

Consequently, in order to account for the sample bias26, in Table 2 we \nexclude R&D expenditure, and estimate the model for all 266 observations. As will be highlighted \nwhen commenting on the specific results, the sample selection bias affects only some of the results \nreported in Table 1. \n[Insert Tables 1, 2, and 3] \n In regressions 1-2 of Table 1 (US) and Table 3 (EU) the initial level of patents, the measure for \nlocal innovative efforts, the proxy for knowledge spillovers, and the social filter variable are \nsuccessively introduced. In regressions 3-7 the individual components of the social filter are included \nseparately in order to discriminate among them. From regression 8 onwards the variables relative to the \nterritorial organisation of the local economy (migration, agglomeration, and specialisation) are \nintroduced sequentially. Table 2 follows the same order but without controlling for R&D expenditure \nand knowledge spillovers. \n The Adj-R2 confirms the overall goodness-of-fit of all the regressions presented and in all cases \nF-statistics probability lets us reject the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are zero. VIF \ntests were conducted for the variables included in all the specifications of the model excluding the \npresence of multicollinearity. There was no spatial autocorrelation in the residuals detected using the \nMoran\u2019s I test (Cliff and Ord 1972).  \nThese results offer a number of insights into the territorial dimension of knowledge production \nin the EU and the US. One of the key similarities in the geography of regional innovation of the US and \nEurope is the presence of territorial convergence in the regional distribution of innovative outputs over \nthe last few years. The coefficient on the initial level of patenting activity is in both cases negative and \n                                                 \n25\n The 145 MSAs for which R&D data are available account for 89,9% of the GDP generated in all 266 MSAs and show an \naverage of 225.19 patents per million inhabitant against 176.83 for the whole sample. \n26\n Beeson, DeJong, and Troesken (2001) discuss the \u2018sample selection bias\u2019 introduced when choosing cities as unit of \nanalysis rather then county-level data: only places that experienced successful growth in the past are considered in this way. \nThe use of standard metropolitan statistical areas minimises this first bias. However, in order to keep the bias at a minimum, \nwe not only report the results for the most innovative subsample of MSAs, but also for all MSAs in the continental US. \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

This suggests that adequate conditions for the generation of patents \u2013 \ne.g. the emergence or re-location of innovative firms, the changing balance between positive and \nnegative externalities arising from agglomeration at different stages of product life cycles, and changes \nin the competitive advantage of some locations in response to changes in technological paradigms \u2013 \nhave spread to formerly peripheral areas, making the regional distribution of innovative output more \nevenly spread (in line with the results of Moreno et al. 2005b for the EU regions). This generalised \ntrend towards the dispersion of innovative activities seems to be less accentuated in the United States \nthan in the EU: when all the 266 MSAs are included in the analysis (thus also taking into account the \nless innovative MSAs), the convergence parameter is smaller and less significant in the US than in the \nEU.  \nIn the US the relatively higher stability of the geography of the innovative output is associated \nwith a positive and statistically significant impact (Table 1 Regression 1) of local innovative activities \non innovative output: the higher the level of local R&D expenditure, the higher the patent growth rate \nat the local level. The production of knowledge and innovation are more localised in the US than in \nEurope, as implied also by the lack of evidence of inter-MSA spillovers: the spatially-weighted \naverage of neighbouring MSAs\u2019 R&D expenditure does not exert any statistically significant influence \nupon patent growth rate. In the EU the opposite territorial dynamic occurs. Local innovation \nproductivity is not directly related to the level of R&D expenditure or, at least, the relationship seems \nto hold only in the short run. When patent growth over the 1990-2002 time span is regressed on initial \nR&D expenditure the coefficient is not significant (Table 3 Regression 1) but, when the shorter period \n1995-2002 is considered, the coefficient is positive and significant (Table 3 Regression A). Instead, \nthe positive and significant coefficient of the spatially-weighted average of neighbouring regions \nR&D expenditure (Table 3 Regression 1) shows that the long-run growth rate of innovative activities \nin the EU is shaped more by exposure to interregional knowledge spillovers.  \nThree potential factors may lie behind the differences between the US and Europe in the \nimpact of innovative inputs on innovative outputs: the distance between innovative centres, the \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

Large innovative areas tend to be physically \ncloser in Europe than in the US. In addition, empirical analyses of the diffusion of spillovers have \nhighlighted the presence of very strong distance decay effects in the US \u2013 knowledge spillovers, in \ngeneral, do not spread beyond a 80 to 110 kms radius from the MSA where they are generated (Varga \n2000; \u00c1cs 2002) \u2013 whereas in Europe the geographical diffusion of spillovers is felt in a radius of 200 \nto 300 kms from the point of origin (Bottazzi and Peri 2003; Moreno et al. 2005a; Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and \nCrescenzi 2006). Greater proximity and lower distance decay suggest a greater potential for European \nregions to rely on innovative inputs in neighbouring areas as a source of innovation and develop inter-\nregional relational networks between innovative actors supported by spatial proximity (Maggioni et al. \n2006). Greater distance and stronger distance decay effects are, in contrast, likely to lead to the \ncreation of self-contained innovative areas in the US, which necessarily have to rely on their own \ninnovative inputs rather than on spillovers from other MSAs. \nR&D inputs in the US tend also to be more specialised and better targeted than in Europe. A \nlegacy of efforts by virtually every European nation-state to have a presence in a large number of \nareas of knowledge has resulted in duplications and redundancies in R&D that European integration \nhas, so far, failed to overcome (Gambardella and Malerba 1999: 9; Mariani 2002). The existence of a \nmuch more integrated market in the US has favoured the formation of a more specialised geographical \ninnovation structure. \nLast but not least - as discussed in section 3 - the literature has extensively documented the \ndifference in labour mobility between the two continents, which may also leave an important imprint \non their respective geographies of innovation. In the US, high levels of mobility may allow better \nongoing matching of innovative actors in space; consequently, they interact more strongly on a local \nbasis, relying less on spillovers from other MSAs than in Europe. The weaker convergence parameter \nin the USA is an outcome not only of the stronger impact of local R&D expenditure, but also because \nof the higher and more variable productivity of such expenditure, thanks to the better spatial matching \nobtained through higher factor mobility. In contrast, weaker intra-regional synergies force European \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

The more \nstable EU population distribution \u2013 with a lower degree of internal mobility \u2013 produces a more inter-\nregionally integrated and \u2018redistributive\u2019 innovation system, which depends for its functioning on \ninter-regional communication and \u2018distance\u2019 learning. Matching at the local level is severely \nhampered by low levels of mobility27. \nWhile the spatial diffusion of knowledge exhibits different territorial dynamics in the EU and \nthe US, empirical evidence suggests that, in both contexts, the endogenous socio-economic factors, \nwhich enable the translation of both endogenously produced and exogenous knowledge into innovative \noutput, are quite similar. Both in the US and in Europe the social filter variables show positive and \nsignificant signs (Table 1 Regression 2; Table 3 Regression 2). The existence of a set of local socio-\neconomic factors may be a pre-condition for the establishment of a successful regional system of \ninnovation and seems to play an important role in explaining differential innovative performance in the \nregions of the EU and in US MSAs. In addition, in both contexts, the local economy is not strongly \naffected by the socio-economic conditions of neighbouring areas: the spatially weighted average of the \nsocio-economic conditions of neighbouring regions is not significant for either the US or the EU \n(Table 1 Regression 2 and Table 3 Regression 2, respectively). However this evidence needs to be \nplaced in the context of the different geographical processes in the two continents. The fact that \nneighbouring regions\u2019 social filter conditions have no impact on local innovative performance is \nconsistent with the more \u2018localistic\u2019 and \u2018self-sufficient\u2019 nature of the US territorial dynamics of \ninnovation. In the European Union the similarly localised impact of the social filter conditions is at \nodds with the less localistic, inter-regional communications deemed necessary to enable knowledge \nmatching. This suggests a potential inconsistency in the EU system of innovation, where social filter \n                                                 \n27\n When assessing this phenomenon it must, however, be borne in mind that the unit of analysis in the case of the EU are \nNUTS regions i.e. territorial units for the production of regional statistics for the European Union whose definition mainly \nserves administrative purposes. As a consequence, NUTS regions might not always approximate the functional borders of \nthe regional economy. Conversely, US MSAs are closer to the concept of \u2018functional urban regions\u2019 (Cheshire and Hay, \n1989) and likely to be more \u2018self-contained\u2019 in terms of economic interactions. Consequently, part of the difference between \nthe empirical evidence recorded in the two cases may be due to the different nature of the spatial unit of analysis. \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n26 \nconditions are unable to extend their benefit over distance thus reinforcing the need for long-distance \nknowledge flows as a way of compensating the consequences of low factor mobility. \nWhen the individual components of the social filter are assessed separately, the significant and \npositive effect of higher education is apparent in both contexts (Regressions 3 and 4 in Tables 1 and \n2). More specifically, from the inspection of Table 1, the key resource for the US regions seems to be \nthe population holding bachelors, postgraduate, or professional degrees. The percentage of people \nholding only some \u2018college level education\u2019, without a full degree, is insignificant. However, this \nresult in the case of the US may be partially due to the sample selection bias discussed above: when \nthe whole sample of MSAs is considered (Table 2 Regressions 2 and 3) both education variables are \nsignificant. This implies that for the most innovative MSAs, where the majority of the R&D \nexpenditure is concentrated, the true differential competitive factor seems to be a higher level of \nspecialised skills while, in the overall sample of the MSAs, more generic skills may also play a role in \nimproving local innovative performance. In the EU context, where slightly different indicators are \navailable, the educational achievements of the population (Table 3 Regression 4) exert a positive and \nsignificant influence on innovative output (while those of employed people only are not significant \u2013 \nTable 3 Regression). An additional factor that seems to foster innovation in both the EU and the US is \nthe presence of a favourable demographic structure: the regions where the incidence of young adults is \nhigher tend to produce more innovation (Tables 1 and 3 Regression 5). Only in the US does a higher \nrate of unemployment seem to discourage the production of innovation (Table 1 Regression 6 and \nTable 2 Regression 5), while in the EU this effect is not statistically significant. The percentage of the \nlabour force concentrated in agriculture is not significant in either context. From this we conclude that \nthe productive use of human resources is less important than the quality of such resources. \n The final part of the empirical analysis takes up the territorial organisation of the factors of \nproduction: migration flows and the density of human interactions, on the one hand, and the \nagglomeration and specialisation of economic activities, on the other. In US MSAs the rate of net \ndomestic migration exercises a positive and significant effect on patent growth rates (Table 1 \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis. Journal of economic geography, 7 (6). pp. 673-709. ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n27 \nRegression 8; Table 2 Regression 7). By contrast, the innovative productivity of the EU regions is \nunable to benefit from this kind of flow due to lower mobility of European workers: as Peri (2005) \npoints out, not only does the US receive a much larger flow of immigrants (in absolute and relative \nterms) from the rest of the world than the EU, but \u201cthe US also complements these large inflows of \nimmigrants with a very high internal mobility of its citizens\u201d (p.22). Our results can be effectively \ninterpreted in the light of these different features of the labour market, underscoring that there are \nterritorial mechanisms through which they exert their influence upon the innovative performance of \nthe two continents (echoing the results of Ottaviano and Peri 2006). US MSAs benefit from the \ninflows of skilled labour that result in higher productivity and innovation, but innovation also acts as a \nmagnet for skilled individuals that would, in turn, contribute to further innovation. A virtuous circle of \ninnovation and migration is thus generated in the US. In Europe, due to the greater cultural and \ninstitutional barriers to mobility, this virtuous circle is much weaker. \n Looking at the role of agglomeration effects, Table 1 suggests that in American MSAs neither \npopulation density (Regression 9), nor the percentage of total US personal income (Regression 10) \nhave a significant effect. However, when the sample selection bias discussed before is accounted for, \nby considering the whole 266 MSA sample, \u2018population density\u2019 shows a positive and significant sign \n(Table 2 Regression 8) \u2013 and its significance increases when assessed together with migration rate28 \n(Table 2 Regression 11) \u2013 while \u2018regional % of national GDP\u2019 remains insignificant in either case. In \nthe EU context the opposite is true: population density is not significant (Table 3 Regression 9) while \n\u2018regional % of national GDP\u2019 is positive and significant both alone and after controlling for population \ndensity (Table 3 Regression 10 and 11 respectively). It appears that in the US, the density of human \ncontacts is important for innovative productivity since it enables the maximisation of intra-regional \nspillovers. As previously discussed, these exchanges prevail over inter-regional knowledge flows. \nConversely, the agglomeration of economic activities, a proxy which emphasizes the \u2018scale\u2019 side of \nagglomeration economies, is not a differential source of competitive advantage for US MSAs: the \n                                                 \n28\n This is consistent with the notion that because mobility is higher in the US, innovation systems have more local matching \nand learning and hence are more \u2018local\u2019 than in Europe, where long distance communication is necessary in order to match \nrelatively immobile agents. \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

Consequently the \u2018scale component\u2019 of agglomeration economies does not \nemerge as a differential innovative factor (i.e. in addition to the density of human interactions\/localised \nknowledge spillovers).  \nIn the EU, local interaction density does not seem to stimulate innovation productivity. The \npositive effect of population density on human interaction \u2013 predicted by the theory of agglomeration \nand observed empirically in the US case \u2013 seems to be offset, in the EU, by a broader set of territorial \nforces. Population density, in a context of low labour mobility as in the EU, may encourage the \npooling and stratification of inadequate skills while US agglomerations are usually newer and, in \nabsolute terms, less densely populated. Competitive advantage for the EU regions is instead promoted \nby the relative concentration of wealth which, as seen above, proxies the \u2018scale\u2019 side of agglomeration \neconomies.  \n Absolute size of clusters. There is a vigorous debate in the literature over whether agglomeration \neconomies can be fully captured by measures of relative concentration, or whether the absolute size of \nclusters is more relevant to understanding the effects of geographical concentration on productivity (see \nDuranton and Puga, 2000, for a review). Some recent literature places increasing emphasis on the \nabsolute size of clusters as the basis for calculating the level of specialization, arguing that this level is \nsystematically underestimated for larger metropolitan areas when relative levels of concentration are \nused (Drennan and Lobo 2007). We address this issue by proxying the absolute economic size of each \nMSA\/region by its total population, total employment, and total GDP. We then calculate an interaction \nterm between the degree of specialisation of the regional economy (Krugman Index) and its absolute \nsize (proxied as specified above). The results are reported in Table 4 \u2013 for the 145 MSAs for which \nR&D data are available, Table 5 \u2013 for the full US sample (266 MSAs), and Table 6 \u2013 for the EU. \n[Insert Tables 4, 5, and 6] \nAll proxies for the absolute size of the MSAs\/Regions show a positive and significant effect \nboth in the US (but only when all the 266 MSAs are considered, Table 5) and in the EU (Table 6). \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

The interaction \nterm between absolute size and specialisation is negative and significant in the US (when the full \nsample is considered, Table 5) while it is not significant for the EU regions (Table 6). When the \ninteraction term between absolute size and specialisation is introduced: \n\u03b5+\u03b2+\u03b2+\u03b2+\u03b2+\u03b2+\u03b2+\u03b1=\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\n\u2212\nSize*xKrumanIndeSizeSocFilterRDexKrugmanInd)Paln(\nPa\nPa\nln\nT\n1\n65432Tt,i1\nTt,i\nt,i\n               \n(5) \n \nfrom which, when considering the partial effect of absolute size on patent growth rate (holding all \nother variables fixed), one obtains: \n \nexKrugmanInd65Size\nTt,iPa\nt,iPaln\nT\n1\n\u03b2+\u03b2=\n\u2206\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\n\u2206\n             (6) \n   \n \nthis implies, with \u03b26<0, that, ceteris paribus, the more a cluster is \u2018specialised\u2019 (high Krugman index \nscore), the more an increase in its absolute size reduces its productivity in terms of new patents. This \ncan be interpreted as showing that in the US the absolute size of clusters exerts a positive impact on \ninnovation, but such impact is reduced when large absolute size is coupled to high specialisation. \nSpecialisation is not inherently negative for innovative performance (Krugman index not significant), \nbut larger clusters need to be \u2018specialised in more than one sector\u2019 in order to fully exploit the benefit \nfrom their absolute economic size. In the EU, the absolute size of clusters always exerts a positive \ninfluence on innovative performance and the degree of specialisation has always a negative impact \n(Krugman Index negative and significant). However, there is no significant (negative or positive) \ninteraction between the two terms. Thus, ceteris paribus, an increase in the size of a cluster improves its \ninnovative performance whatever its degree of specialisation and, symmetrically, more specialisation \nwould lead to less innovation whatever the absolute economic size of the region.  \nThese results reconfirm the \u2018national\u2019 bias of the EU process of innovation. In Europe lower \nlevels of economic integration and factor mobility make specialisation a handicap for innovative \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

In contrast, in the integrated US context, only very large clusters in highly specialised \nlocal economies seem to suffer from reduced capacity to exploit knowledge-base complementarities. \nSpecial care is called for in interpreting the significance of the coefficients, as one does not have to test \nseparately the significance of \u03b25 and \u03b26 but rather the joint hypothesis Ho:\u03b25=0, \u03b26=0 (Wooldridge 2003). \nTo test this joint hypothesis, we implement the Wald Coefficient Test whose results, in the case of the \nUS 266 MSAs, permit to reject Ho at the 1 percent level, allowing to conclude that the estimated \ncoefficients are significant in both cases. Additionally, the Wald Test is not affected by the intrinsically \nlower orthogonality of the two variables.  \n This picture is further enriched when accounting for the influence on innovative performance \nof the degree of specialisation of the local economy in the two continents. In the United States, the \nproxy for the degree of specialisation of the local economy (the Krugman Index) is not statistically \nsignificant (Table 1 Regressions 11 and 12). In the European case (Table 3 Regression A), in contrast, \nmore specialised regions seem to be persistently disadvantaged in their capability to produce \ninnovation. Specialisation is not a constraint for the process of innovation of US regions, where there \nseems to be mix of MAR and Jacobs externalities, more so than in the EU. In the US context, the \nhigher labour mobility and the relatively less constrained (by political, institutional, and cultural \nfactors) location choices of firms and individuals allow each innovative actor to select the most \nadvantageous location according to its own technological or organisational needs (e.g. according to \nthe current stage of the life-cycle of their product, as in Audretsch, 2003 and Duranton and Puga, \n2005). In this context the geography of innovative actors effectively accommodates the possibility, \noffered by each region, to benefit from either sectoral specialisation or diversity. By virtue of this \nmechanism, specialisation ceases to be an obstacle for the production of innovation, since internal \nfactor mobility will allow specialised areas to attract agents able to benefit from MAR externalities \nwhile pushing the other agents towards more diversified areas.

On the contrary, it would be necessary to fully control for the specific regional patterns of specialisation: \ngiven the aggregate degree of regional specialisation, the true differential factor could stem from a region being specialised \nin high tech R&D-intensive vs traditional sectors (Smith 2007). Further investigation, in an EU-US comparative perspective, \nof the sectoral level territorial processes remains in our agenda for future research. \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n31 \nof US agglomerations may also allow them to benefit from a certain degree of knowledge-base \ncomplementarities even in relatively more specialised contexts. This dynamism of the ongoing \nprocess of re-organisation of US economic activities in response to changing sectoral location \nadvantages is confirmed by the evidence produced by Desmet and Fafchamps (2005) for county-level \nemployment. They find both de-concentration of non-service employment and clustering of service \njobs in high aggregate employment agglomerations: location patterns in certain sectors may be \nchanging in response to shifts in the pattern of localised externalities. However, the de-concentration \nof manufacturing has benefited counties 20 to 70 km away from large agglomerations, while service \nactivities have clustered in large agglomerations within a 20 km radius. This particular spatial scope of \nconcentration\/de-concentration dynamics seems to suggest the existence of fundamentally intra-MSA \nadjustments, along the lines of the \u2018localistic\u2019 view of the US process geography. As the EU and USA \nshow different rates of adjustment, through mobility of labour and capital, they generate different \nunderlying patterns of specialization (even if the overall levels are similar). This clarifies the meaning \nof the observed negative impact of specialisation on the innovative performance of the EU. It suggests \nthat for the USA, it is not so much the level of specialisation that matters, as the ability to adjust the \ncontent of local factors to the changing needs of innovation. \nCiccone (2002) suggests that the degree of agglomeration of the local economy is not \nsubstantially different in the two continents. Our results indicate that the comparative analysis of the \nprocessual aspects of the production of new knowledge cannot be \u2018reduced\u2019 to the level of \nagglomeration. On the contrary, the analysis of agglomeration economies needs to be pursued in \nconjunction with other relevant territorial processes, in the context of the overall geographical \ndynamic of the economy and its factor markets. \n \n6. Conclusions \nOur empirical analysis of the geography of innovation in the US and Europe reveals that \nknowledge production in both continents is governed by different geographical processes.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n32 \nthe generation of innovation usually occurs in self-contained geographical areas that rely on their own \nR&D inputs, on favourable local socio-economic environments, and on the training and attraction of \nhighly skilled individuals. In Europe the process is much more linked not just to having an adequate \nlocal socio-economic context, but to proximity to other innovative areas and to the capacity to \nassimilate and transform inter-regional knowledge spillovers into innovation. Human capital mobility, \nin contrast to the US case, does not play a role. Specialization is also negatively associated with the \ngenesis of innovation in Europe, where agglomeration is a better driver of innovation. Hence, while \nEurope relies on Jacobian externalities for innovation, US MSAs can count on both MAR and \nJacobian externalities. It can then be inferred that the dynamic reorganisation of European innovation \nresources is severely limited by the EU\u2019s lower levels of factor mobility and integration than in the \nUS.  \n Two key forces lie behind these diverse territorial dynamics of innovation. First is the \n\u2018national bias\u2019 in EU innovation. Despite rapid economic integration, distinct national and regional \nsystems of innovation persist in Europe and are propped up by lingering interest by national \ngovernments to preserve or improve local technological or innovative capacities. Countries across the \nEU maintain their own innovative strategies that may to a larger or lesser extent conform with the \nEuropean-wide Lisbon Agenda. Since the US is a much more economically, culturally, and \npsychologically integrated market, innovation processes there are shaped principally by national \nforces; the states have a minor role in financing major innovation programs. While some states do \nhave major public research universities, the R&D in those institutions is financed by the federal \ngovernment At 60% on average, with private funds contributing about 20% to their budgets, and states \nabout 20%, mostly toward their teaching activities. At a national level, in any case, the emphasis tends \nto be much more on creating adequate general conditions for innovation to take hold and allowing \ngeographical processes to bring the agents together. \n A second force is the European concern with cohesion, even in the genesis of innovation. \nWhereas in the US the location of innovation is strongly influenced by market forces, in the EU the \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

ISSN 1468-2702 \n \n33 \nLisbon Agenda shares the somewhat contradictory goals of \u2018making Europe the most competitive \nknowledge-based economy in the world\u2019, while, at the same time, promoting territorial cohesion. \nNational innovation policies have also been sensitive to cohesion concerns, with large chunks of the \npublic R&D effort in recent years having been spent \u2013 especially in peripheral countries \u2013 in territories \nwith a weaker innovative base. \n A clear example of these two contrasting cultures of innovation can be found in the \nAeronautics industry. In the US, Boeing has almost half of its workforce concentrated in one location, \nwhere it can benefit from economies of scale and the advantages of specialisation. Workers with the \nnecessary skills to work in Boeing are expected to migrate. Airbus, Boeing\u2019s main rival was originally \na consortium of firms and, in practice, remains very much so. National interests, cultural differences, \nand the greater cost of migration in Europe, have made of Airbus a company with multiple centres, \nwith only 28% of its workforce concentrated in its main plant in Toulouse, France. Different functions \nare performed in different plants located hundreds of kilometres from one another. \nDo these different territorial dynamics of innovation make a serious difference in outcomes? It \nis important not to rush to judgment from this analysis. At first glance, it might be tempting to echo \nmany other analyses in calling for an \u2018Americanization\u2019 of European process geography: greater \nfactor mobility, bigger and more specialised agglomerations, more integration. The analysis pursued \nhere, however, also sees some signs of a distinctly European pathway to integration: given these lower \nlevels of mobility, and an historically more dispersed and less specialised urban system, and the \npersistence of national institutions and cultures, it may be that Europe is developing functional \nequivalents for American mobility and specialisation, in the form of greater inter-metropolitan \nknowledge exchange and cooperation. Certainly, the advances in the European transport system (high \nspeed rail, cheap flights) are bringing metropolitan areas closer together than ever before, as are \nheightened levels of intra-firm, inter-firm, and inter-governmental cooperation. In the global \naeronautics industry it is unclear whether the Boeing or the Airbus model will emerge victorious. \nDespite coordination glitches \u2013 such as the recent wiring problem in the new Airbus 380 \u2013 Airbus has \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.

And recent advances in telecommunications and transportations \nmay help increase the viability of the more diffuse European systems of innovation. The question is \nwhether, at some point, these represent viable functional alternatives to the American process \ngeography, i.e. capable of helping Europe overcome the innovation gap.  \nIn any event, the present analysis suggests that, in both continents, the territorial dynamics of \ninnovation, as well as its basic geographical foundations, are essential elements in considering the \nperformance of these innovation systems. \nCrescenzi, Riccardo, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, Andr\u00e9s and Storper, Michael (2007) The territorial dynamics of innovation: a Europe-United \nStates comparative analysis.
