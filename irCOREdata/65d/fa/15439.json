Res., 45, W08423, doi:10.1029\/2008WR007336.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Not all locations in a river catchment, even if they\nhave the same land use, contribute equally to the delivery of\nsediment or nutrients and hence in-stream sedimentation and\nwater quality degradation [Gburek et al., 2000; Heathwaite\net al., 2000; Quinn, 2004; Lane et al., 2008]. Rather, certain\nareas have been shown to be critical sources, where the\nability both to entrain material and to connect it to the\ndrainage network controls the level of delivery [Cammeraat,\n2002; Ambroise, 2004; Beven et al., 2005]. Diffuse nutrient\nand sediment issues can be redefined as comprising a series\nof point sources (i.e., fields, or even parts of fields) where\nparticularly risky land uses combine with a high probability\nof connection of those risks to the river system [Lane et al.,\n2006, 2008]. In this paper, we focus upon connection by\noverland flow pathways. This type of connection appears to\nbe conditioned by local, often sub-field-scale, hydrology\n[e.g., Blackwell et al., 1999; Burt et al., 1999;Western et al.,\n1999, 2001; Lane et al., 2004; Quinn, 2004; Heathwaite et\nal., 2005], in some cases related to quite subtle topographic\nattributes (e.g., Figure 1). However, diffuse land manage-\nment signals emerge over much larger spatial scales, as a\nresult of the integration across the landscape to the drainage\nnetwork of these finer-scale processes.\n[3] This scale issue represents an immediate challenge for\nhydrological modeling, and the management of diffuse\ndrivers of in-stream water quality and ecological degrada-\ntion in particular, as well as for capturing the impacts of\nprocesses like climate change upon future stream processes.\nThe dominant approach to profiling diffuse pollution risk is\nbased upon use of simple empirical transfer functions.\nThese translate known fertilizer and manure inputs, coupled\nwith soil nutrient status [e.g., Jordan et al., 1994; Johnes,\n1996; Heathwaite et al., 2003; Herrmann et al., 2003;\nEkholm et al., 2005] into an estimate of the amount of\nmaterial that is exported from a land unit. Such functions\nmay be extended to include physically based models of\nnutrient cycling in individual land units in order to improve\nthe estimation of export [e.g., Priess et al., 2001; Weber et\nal., 2001; Binder et al., 2003; Wolf et al., 2005; Matthews,\n2006; Vatn et al., 2006]. While there remain unresolved\nissues with these kinds of models, much less attention has\nbeen given to the role played by hydrological connectivity\nin delivering generated material to the river network. The\nmost simplified approaches have no real treatment of\nconnectivity at all, as in the Soil Conservation Service Curve\nNumber method used in various models [e.g., Beasley et al.,\n1Institute of Hazard and Risk Research and Department of Geography,\nScience Laboratories, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n2Centre for Sustainable Water Management, Lancaster Environment\nCentre, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/09\/2008WR007336$09.00\nW08423\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 45, W08423, doi:10.1029\/2008WR007336, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1 of 10\n1980; Savard, 2000; Weber et al., 2001; Galbiati et al.,\n2006]. Basic attempts to recognize the effects of connectiv-\nity have been introduced, such as through weighting deliv-\nery according to the distance of a land unit from the nearest\nwater course [e.g., Johnes and Heathwaite, 1997; Munafo et\nal., 2005], or in a more sophisticated way, such as a function\nof downslope distance from a water course [e.g., Childress\net al., 2002]. Physically based, distributed models, which\nsolve for both the vertical and lateral flux of water across\nthe landscape have also been developed [e.g., Adams et al.,\n1995; De Roo and Jetten, 1999]. However, these models\ntend to lose much of the spatial detail of what we know\nabout which areas of the landscape are most likely to be\nCritical Source Areas because they are commonly applied\n[e.g., Adams et al., 1995] at scales (up to 1 km2) coarser\nthan those that are likely to control connectivity, typically\n<0.0025 km2 (e.g., Figure 1). There are two related reasons\nfor this coarse scale of application. The first is that these\nmodels are exceptionally demanding in terms of parameter-\nization (e.g., see Merritt et al. [2003] for review) The\ninformation demands of model calibration often exceed\navailable data [Heathwaite, 2003; Harris and Heathwaite,\n2005] even given improvements in data acquisition and\nassimilation, and the models are rarely parsimonious with\nrespect to the data available to determine them.\n[4] The second comes from the computational difficulty\nof running such models with time steps that are small\nenough to capture the dynamics of catchment response\nand spatial resolutions that can capture the heterogeneous\nstructure of the topography of drainage basins. Figure 1\nshows how, over a very small distance, there is a substantial\ndifference between required process representations; here\nbetween a channelized rill type flow and more diffuse,\npotential, overland flow. Representing such process gra-\ndients with small spatial scales (<0.0025 km2) in very large\nriver basins (>1000 km2), with a time dependence, remains\na challenge. Historically, hydrological analyses have as-\nsumed that the physical representation in a model should\ntake dominance over the spatial discretization of that model,\nwith the result that models with physics developed for small\nspatial scales (e.g., Darcy\u2019s law) are applied over very large\nspatial units (e.g., 1 km2 [Adams et al., 1995]), even though\nheterogeneity within those units undermines critical\nassumptions, such as uniform water table slope, upon which\nthose physics depend. As Figure 1 shows, the scale of unit\nthat controls delivery of eroded sediment is, in this case\n<0.0025 km2. For situations where topographic detail exerts\nan important control upon hydrological response, new\ntechnologies, notably airborne laser altimetry and interfer-\nometric SAR have been shown to be of sufficient quality for\nhydrological analysis [e.g., Milledge et al., 2009]. This\nprovides an imperative to reevaluate the norms of hydro-\nlogical analysis under the assumption that the physical\nrepresentation adopted in a hydrological model should be\ncommensurate with the spatial representation of the process\ngradients that the model aims to represent. This is not an\nargument against using physically based models but rather a\nrecognition that the level of physical simplification in the\nmodel should be parsimonious with both the data available to\nrepresent them and the processes that are to be represented.\n[5] We have been approaching this problem by exploring\nhow to incorporate sufficient of what we know about the\nphysics of hydrological connection, in this case by overland\nflow, into diffuse pollution models. As part of this research,\nwe have obtained a surprising result in terms of the role\nplayed by topography in controlling surface hydrological\nconnectivity. It opens up a wealth of new ways of thinking\nabout diffuse land management risks in river catchments\nthat allows a much stronger hydrological input to diffuse\npollution modeling. The focus of this paper is connectivity\nby surface overland flow in temperate upland environments\nassociated with shallow soils. We conceptualize connectiv-\nity as being driven by the propensity to generate saturated\noverland flow (SOLF), which expands and contracts in\nspace and time [e.g., Beven and Wood, 1983]. As this\noccurs, so possible sources of land management risk are\ntapped, becoming Critical Source Areas [Heathwaite et al.,\n2000]. In this paper, we test the role played by topography\nin controlling SOLF generation and subsequent connectivity\nby comparing an index-based representation of connectivity,\nthe Network Index, with predictions from a physically\nbased, distributed, hydrological model. The paper begins\nwith a theoretical reformulation of the Network Index as an\nindex of hydrological connectivity by surface overland flow,\nthen explains the methodology we used to test this refor-\nmulation, and finally discusses the implications of the\nresults obtained as well as the limitations of the findings\nof the analysis.\n2. Theoretical Formulation of the Network Index\nas an Index of Hydrological Connectivity\n[6] The topographic index [Kirkby, 1975] is commonly\nused as a measure of the relative propensity for a point in\nthe landscape to develop saturation and, if saturation is\ncontrolled by topography alone, locations with the same\nvalue of the topographic index should have the same\nhydrological response. The topographic index uses the ratio\nof the area drained per unit contour length (the upslope\ncontributing area) to the tangent of the local slope. How-\never, research has shown that the degree of spatial organi-\nFigure 1. Sub-field-scale soil erosion and the role of a\nsmall-scale (<25 m2) surface hollow in causing disconnec-\ntion. Source: Eden Rivers Trust.\n2 of 10\nW08423 LANE ET AL.: HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY W08423\nzation of soil moisture limits the effectiveness of this index\n[e.g.,Western et al., 1999] primarily because the topographic\nindex assumes steady state drainage conditions, which is a\nnecessary assumption for a terrain-based determination of\nthe upslope contributing area [Barling et al., 1994]. Subse-\nquent research has reformulated the topographic index to\nhave a dynamic component based upon the notion of an\neffective contributing area [e.g., Barling et al., 1994;\nGrayson et al., 1997; Pin\u02dcol et al., 1997]. The approach\nwe adopt in this paper is similar to Pin\u02dcol et al.\u2019s [1997] and\nis based upon the concept that local soil saturation deficits\ncontrol when a noncontributing area begins to contribute, at\nleast for shallow soils. However, we set this deficit as a\nresult of an implicit analysis of terrain rather than introduc-\ning it as an explicit model parameter. In this application, we\ndo not specify any spatial variation in transmissivity and\nhence are assuming a uniform, shallow (<c. 1.0 m) soil type.\n[7] Under these assumptions, the lowest value of the\ntopographic index along the flow path that connects a point\non a hillslope to the drainage network should control the\nconnectivity of that point to the drainage network by surface\noverland flow. Lane et al. [2004] call this the Network\nIndex. Points with higher values of the Network Index will\nconnect more readily with the drainage network. Lane et al.\n[2004] determined the Network Index using a 2 m resolu-\ntion digital elevation model acquired using airborne laser\naltimetry to show that not only were runoff source areas in\nan upland catchment variable in time and space but, and\ncrucially, not all source areas were hydrologically connected\nto the drainage network even in extreme storm events. The\nkey driver of this was local topographic variability at scales\nof 20 m or less.\n[8] The Network Index is a static descriptor of the\npropensity to surface hydrological connectivity. Aside from\nthe assumptions above, its relevance to hydrological con-\nnection can be challenged by the observation that connec-\ntivity will be crucially controlled by storm event duration\n[Bracken and Croke, 2007]: the delivery of material from a\npoint in the landscape to the river channel within a storm\nevent will require a longer storm event the further the point\nis away from the river channel along the associated flow\npath. There are two conditions that lead to disconnection.\nType 1 disconnection occurs where material is moving\nalong a flow path during a storm event, but reaches a point\nalong that path that becomes dry before it reaches the\ndrainage network. Type 2 occurs where the event is of\ninsufficient magnitude and duration to wet the driest point\nalong a flow path, such that the material reaches a dry point\nbefore it reaches the drainage network. In terms of the\ntransfer of material across the landscape, the significance of\ndisconnection depends upon the parameter being consid-\nered. For a physically conservative parameter that cannot\ninfiltrate significantly into the soil column (e.g., fine sedi-\nment), it will be deposited at the surface and remain there\nuntil a subsequent entrainment event and associated surface\nhydrological transfer, unless contaminants are attached to it\nthat are soluble. It is probable that sites of disconnection are\nzones of temporary material accumulation until the associ-\nated connection condition is met. It may also mean that\nunderstanding connection and disconnection without refer-\nence to the spatial structure of probable disconnection along\na flow path is not possible. For a nonconservative param-\neter, these processes will be further complicated by the\npossibility that it will change. For a dissolved parameter,\nsubsurface hydrological connection will become important.\n[9] Given these observations, there are logical limits to\nusing the Network Index to describe hydrological connec-\ntion. However, the question remains as to how much\ninformation the Network Index contains about hydrological\nconnection. Thus, there are three hypotheses that we test in\nthis paper. First, points that are drier will require a larger\nrainfall event for them to connect upstream flow paths to the\nriver network. Thus, when integrated through time, they are\nmore likely to limit connectivity by surface overland flow.\nHence, whether or not a point can ever connect with the\ndrainage network by surface overland flow could be con-\ntrolled by the Network Index, with the probability of\nconnection being greater for higher values of the Network\nIndex. Second, although the Network Index is a static\ndescriptor on the basis of spatial attributes, it should\nimplicitly contain a temporal component in terms of the\nnumber of times that there is likely to be connection through\npoints that limit connectivity. The number of times a point\nwill connect will be greater for higher values of the Network\nIndex. Third, if the number of times a point connects is\ngreater, the duration of connection should be greater. The\ncaveat to this is that for points along a given flow path\nwhich share the same Network Index (i.e., the same\ndownstream connection-controlling point), those further\nup the flow path are likely to have lower durations of\nconnectivity as a result of Type 1 disconnection.\n3. Methodology\n[10] The methodology has two components: (1) use of a\ndistributed hydrological model and extraction of informa-\ntion to test these hypotheses regarding hydrological con-\nnectivity and (2) description of the catchment that we\napplied the connectivity index to, including an explanation\nof how it was applied.\n3.1. Physically Based, Distributed Modeling of\nCatchment Hydrology\n[11] In order to test these hypotheses, we have generated\nhigh-frequency spatially distributed maps of soil moisture\nstatus, and hence saturation, from which we can determine\nwhether or not points in the landscape are connected, how\nmany times within a given integration period and for what\nduration. This has been done using CRUM2D v. 3.1, a fully\ndistributed, physically based hydrological simulation model\nwhich has a similar basis to that described by Reaney et al.\n[2007] and Conlan et al. [2005]. As these types of models\nare well established in the literature, details of the model are\nprovided in the auxiliary material and only a summary is\nprovided here.1\n[12] The landscape is represented using a grid structure\ncoupled with a separate river channel network model. In\neach landscape cell, the hydrological processes of intercep-\ntion, infiltration, evapotranspiration, throughflow and re-\ncharge to groundwater are simulated. Evapotranspiration is\nsimulated using the Priestley-Taylor [Priestley and Taylor,\n1972] method. Infiltration is modeled with the simplified\n1Auxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029\/\n2008WR007336.\nW08423 LANE ET AL.: HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY\n3 of 10\nW08423\nGreen and Ampt [1911] model of Kirkby [1975] which\nrelates the infiltration rate to the soil moisture. Throughflow\nis determined using Darcy\u2019s Law. Soil depth is allowed to\nhave a simple topographic dependence and the saturated\nhydraulic conductivities in both the root zone and the soil, and\nthe decay of the latter with depth, are set as parameters. The\nwater is routed through the river channel network using\nthe Muskingum-Cunge algorithm [Ponce and Lugo, 2001].\nThe model has a variable time step, defined by the rate of\nchange of internal hydrological variables, ranging from 2min\nthrough to 6 h, and this allows minimization of the amount\nof time required for long (annual and multiyear) simulations.\n[13] For this research, a set of indices which describe the\nspatial and temporal dynamics of surface hydrological flows\nhave been developed, aided by the grid structure of the\nmodel and noting that the model itself does not make any\nprior assumptions about the nature of flow connectivity.\nMirroring the definition of the Network Index, we note that\nfor a point to be considered connected, it must not be\nsubject to a Type 2 disconnection: there must be overland\nflow along the complete flow path to the river channel. This\nallows us to determine (1) whether or not a point on the\nlandscape connects during a given period; (2) the number of\ntimes it connects; and (3) the percentage of time that the cell\nis connected completely along a flow path, mirroring the\nhypotheses we are aiming to test. Using the hydrological\nmodel to determine Type 1 disconnection is more complex\nas it requires tracing of generated runoff in time and space,\nsomething that is not possible with the current formulation\nof the model. We emphasize that these determinands are a\nproperty of the model, and not necessarily of the landscape\nthat the model is describing, such that our evaluation of the\nstatic descriptor is effectively a determination of how much\ninformation is lost in the description of catchment connec-\ntivity by using a static descriptor with a simplified under-\nlying physical basis.\n3.2. Case Study Catchment, Determination of the\nNetwork Index, and Application of the Physically\nBased Model\n[14] In this paper, we apply the model to the Upper Rye\ncatchment in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The Upper\nRye catchment is a 13.1 km2 catchment comprised of\ngrassland and moorland (Figure 2). For both the Network\nIndex and application of CRUM2D, we use a 20 m\nresolution DEM, derived from the NEXTMap1 data for\nGreat Britain. Derived values of the Network Index were\nrescaled to a Relative Network Index (RNI). The scaling\nwas linear between 0 and 1. Although our analysis is based\nupon a single case study catchment, it is one that has\ntwo very contrasting geological and topographical settings\n(Figure 2), broadly defined as the eastern and western\nsubcatchments, which allow us to explore both the form\nof the representation at the level of the whole catchment and\nthe two subcatchments. The eastern subcatchment com-\nprises Oolitic sandstones and the western subcatchment\nCordillerian limestones.\n[15] CRUM2D was used in two ways. First, it was\napplied using spatially variable land cover information as\npart of model parameterization. The latter was based upon a\nGeneralized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation [Beven and\nFreer, 2001] using (1) random sampling of 3,000 parameter\nsets for the dominant parameters that controlled model\nresponse; (2) determination of the best parameter sets that\nresulted in independence between two Objective Functions\n(the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency and the Relative Mean\nAbsolute Error) used for model evaluation (see auxiliary\nmaterial); and (3) identification of the range of model\nparameters associated with these parameter sets, labeled\nhere as the behavioral parameter sets. The model reproduces\nthe measured discharge hydrograph well for these parameter\nsets (Figure 3): for the majority of the time, the measured\nvalue is bracketed by \u00b1 one standard deviation of model\npredictions. The minimum value of the Nash Sutcliffe\nEfficiency [Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970] for these simulations\nwas 0.655 and the maximum Mean Absolute Discharge\nError was 0.29 m3 s\u00011, around 10% of base flow discharge,\nthe latter defined as the discharge for which 95% of flows\nare greater. This means that CRUM2D is capturing at least\nsome elements of the landscape\u2019s hydrological response,\neven though we have no further data to test the hypothesis\nthat it is describing aspects of the internal hydrological\nresponse of the system. In methodological terms, this means\nthat if the hydrological model descriptions of connection do\nnot match those of the static descriptor, it could be because\nthe internal process representation in the hydrological model\nis not right. However, if they do match, then some confi-\ndence should be gained in both. We emphasize, as described\nabove, that the hydrological model has a physically based\ntime- and space-dependent, process representation (see\nauxiliary material) which includes representation of both\n(1) at-a-point hydrological response, in terms of evapotrans-\npiration, soil moisture dynamics, and (simultaneously in\nresponse to rainfall intensity and soil moisture state) differ-\nent mechanisms of overland flow generation; and (2) lateral\nrouting of water, both over the surface and through the\nsubsurface.\n[16] In order to determine the surface hydrological con-\nnectivity indices for comparison with the Network Index, a\nparameter set was randomly sampled from the behavioral\nparameter sets but with the land cover set to be uniform, so\nas to provide a meaningful comparison with the assump-\ntions associated with the Network Index. Even with the use\nof a single parameter set, determination of the connectivity\nindices was extremely demanding in terms of data handling\nand analysis. For this reason, the model was run for the\nthree wettest sample years, sampled from the 30 year period\nfrom 1961 to 1990.\n4. Results\n[17] Figure 4 is based upon a binary discriminator as to\nwhether or not a cell is connected completely along a flow\npath during the hydrological model run. The RNI of each\ncell is then used to sort this binary discriminator. The binary\ndiscriminator is then cumulated, scaled by the number of\nsites and plotted against the RNI. This represents the\nprobability that the site is a connecting site as defined by\nthe RNI. If the RNI were a perfect discriminator of\nconnection and disconnection, and given that 47.7% of sites\nconnected during the 3 years of hydrological model simu-\nlations, we would expect an RNI value of 0.523 to be a\nperfect discriminator between sites that do not connect\n(<0.523) and sites that do connect (\u00020.523), with a vertical\nline centered on 0.523. The curve for the full catchment\nshows that the RNI is positively associated with probability\n4 of 10\nW08423 LANE ET AL.: HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY W08423\nof connection. Its mapping onto perfect discrimination (i.e.,\nthe horizontal) is better for lower and higher values of the\nRNI: only a very small percentage of locations with the\nlowest values of the RNI do actually connect; although a\nlarger percentage of locations with the highest value of RNI\ndo not connect (Figure 4). The curve also separates data\npoints into the western and eastern subcatchments to obtain\nsome sense as to the effects of different geological and\ntopographical controls within the catchment. This suggests\nthat the RNI better discriminates connecting sites for\nthe eastern subcatchment than the western subcatchment,\nalthough the differences are relatively small, reaching a\nmaximum difference in probability of 0.08.\n[18] Figure 5 shows a probability density function for the\nRNI plotted against the logarithm of the duration of con-\nnection, the latter scaled on the longest modeled connection;\n200 bins are used. The full catchment (Figure 5a) and the\neastern and western subcatchments (Figures 5b and 5c,\nrespectively) are shown. Figure 5a shows that not only does\nthe RNI contain information on the probability of connec-\ntion, it also contains information on the duration of hydro-\nlogical connection. For RNI values less than 0.5, connection\ndurations are negligible. For RNI values greater than 0.5,\nthere is a clear trend for Relative Index values to have\nprogressively longer connection durations. Given the trans-\nformation applied to the connection access, the duration of\nconnection increases as an exponential function of the RNI.\nComparison of the eastern (Figure 5b) and western (Figure 5c)\nsubcatchments shows differences that are similar to, but clearer\nthan, those suggested for connection probability (Figure 4).\nThe shapes of the plots for the eastern and western sub-\ncatchments are similar. However, for the eastern catch-\nment (Figure 5b), the RNI is more strongly associated\nwith the log-transformed connection duration that for the\nwestern subcatchment (Figure 5c): the RNI values at which\nthere is the onset of much longer connection durations is\nclearer; above this threshold, the RNI is more strongly\nassociated with the log-transformed correction duration;\nand the slope defined between RNI and log-transformed\ncorrection is less steep, such that extrapolation through to\nFigure 2.

This shows that the Relative Network Index has a\nnumber of distinct spatial scales of variability. In the western\nsubcatchment, draining through Hawnby (Figure 2), there is\na marked large-scale difference between the high levels of\nconnection in the north of the subcatchment and along the\nsubcatchment\u2019s west and southwest boundaries and the low\nlevels of connection in the south of the subcatchment\n(Figure 6). High levels of connection tend to be clustered\nupon the stream heads (Figure 6), most clearly along the\nsubcatchment\u2019s west and southwest boundaries. The spatial\nextent of individual well-connected areas is also greater in\nthe north of the subcatchment (Figure 6). In the south of the\nsubcatchment, well-connected areas, which can have a very\nhigh level of connection, are much smaller in their spatial\nextent and tend to be closer to the mainstream.\n[20] In the eastern subcatchment, there is less evidence of\nany large-scale structuring of connection into broadly well\nconnected or poorly connected regions, with the possible\nexception of the eastern side, where levels of connection are\nhigher along the headwater streams of the far eastern edge\n(Figure 6), in ways not dissimilar to the western edge of the\nwestern subcatchment. Rather, variations in connectivity\ntend to have a much finer spatial scale of variability than\nin the western subcatchment (Figure 6). Also, and crucially,\nlocations of high connectivity tend to be located closer to\nthe mainstream, the opposite of the dominant characteristic\nin the western subcatchment, where high-connectivity areas\nwere associated with the stream heads.\n5. Discussion\n[21] These results allow us to assess the three hypotheses\nidentified above. First, despite the RNI being a static spatial\nFigure 4. The cumulative probability that a site is a\nconnecting site as defined by the RNI: if the RNI were a\nperfect discriminator of connection and disconnection and\ngiven that 47.7% of sites connected during the 3 years of\nhydrological model simulations, we would expect a RNI\nvalue of 0.523 to be a perfect discriminator between sites\nthat do not connect (<0.523) and sites that do connect\n(\u00020.523), with a vertical line centered on 0.523. Probabil-\nities >0 for RNI <0.523 are sites that do connect during the\ntime period but are not expected to given their RNI;\nprobabilities <1 for RNI \u00020.523 are sites that do not\nconnect during the time period but would be expected to\ngiven their RNI. Curves are shown for the full catchment\nand the eastern and western subcatchments (see Figure 2).\nFigure 3. Measured and modeled discharge for the Upper Rye catchment, North Yorkshire, United\nKingdom. The chart shows the mean and the \u00b1 one standard deviation of the behavioral simulations.\n6 of 10\nW08423 LANE ET AL.: HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY W08423\nmetric, it enables us to infer whether or not a site connects.\nFollowing from Figure 4, and in the absence of other\ninformation, this can be expressed as a probability that a\nsite connects, for the range of storms modeled using the\nhydrological model, for a given value of the RNI. The form,\nif not the detail, of this relationship does not differ\nsignificantly between the two main subcatchments. In terms\nof diffuse pollution and soil erosion studies, this could\nprovide the first means of incorporating a terrain sensitive\nmeasure of connectivity likelihood in a risk framework,\nwithout recourse to full physically based modeling, and\ninformed by a basic hydrological conceptualization rather\nthan arbitrary weights like distance from nearest water\ncourse. Such modeling would need to address how the form\nof this curve changes with respect to the duration of\nintegration (e.g., monthly, yearly, decadally) and with\ncatchments with different relief and soils and in relation to\npossible climate change impacts.\n[22] Second, and perhaps more surprisingly, the Network\nIndex metric appears to capture some of the temporal\ndynamics of connectivity (Figure 5): negligible connection\ndurations below the RNI of 0.5 followed by an exponential\nincrease in connection duration for values greater than this.\nAgain, the shape of this relationship is similar between\nsubcatchments, but the detail differs, with a stronger asso-\nciation in the eastern subcatchment. Although the definition\nof disconnection adopted is Type 2, it is probable that those\nconnection durations associated with RNI values less than\n0.5 are unlikely to be sufficient for the delivery of material,\nand that the RNI may also be representing Type 1 processes,\nalthough it is important to acknowledge the complexity of\nthe delivery process [Beven et al., 2005] that means that the\nrepresentation is partial. Locations with a higher Network\nIndex are connected for longer, and the spatial signal of\ntopographically induced wetness results in partial control of\nthe dynamics of surface overland flow connectivity and\npotentially delivery. Thus, the surprising finding in this\npaper is that a static descriptor derived from the spatial\nstructure of topographically controlled local wetness is\ncapable of predicting at least some information on the\nlikelihood, frequency and duration of connection.\n[23] Plot-scale studies of the ways in which hillslope\nelements connect to the drainage network may identify\nconnections that deviate from topographical control, as is\nreflected in this study by the scatter present in Figure 5. Our\nresults are unusual in showing that, despite such deviations,\nand through using a numerical model to provide a descrip-\ntion of connectivity that provides information on the entire\nriver catchment, a generalizable landscape attribute can be\nidentified in the absence of other influencing factors. When\njudged at the catchment scale, the importance of topography\nfor hydrological response has been shown to dominate over\nsoil transmissivity [Wood et al., 1990], and while we do not\nexplore transmissivity effects herein, the study confirms the\nimportance of topography in determining the spatial struc-\nture of landscape connectivity. The work emphasizes the\ncare that must be shown in inferring from plot-scale studies\nthe relative importance of connectivity at the landscape\nscale as this importance can only be judged with respect\nFigure 5.

This is shown as a two-\ndimensional probability density function with 0.05 width\nprobability bins.

As a catch-\nment wets up, the RNI at which there is connection will fall.\nRather than leading to the continuous expansion and con-\ntraction of saturated zones as is implied in the traditional\nmodel of topographically controlled saturation, it implies\nthat potentially large landscape units become connected as a\nresult of control by a potentially small number of geograph-\nically localized landscape units. These units are ones where,\nin relative terms, the flux of water is vertical rather than\nlateral. Grayson et al. [1997] conceptualize the landscape as\nswitching through time between periods when connectivity\nis poor as a result of dry antecedent conditions and leading\nto vertical fluxes being dominant and periods when con-\nnectivity is dominated by lateral flux. Herein, we concep-\ntualize the landscape as switching between lateral and\nvertical flux along a flow path. We implicitly assume that\nthe locations along a flow path where vertical fluxes are\nmost likely to be dominant, in this case on the basis of a\nnetwork-scale analysis of the topographic index, are those\nthat are most likely to break up surface flow connectivity.\nAlthough specifically formulated (and evaluated herein) for\nsurface overland flow, the analysis ought to apply equally\nfor shallow subsurface flows and fluxes of material in terms\nof vertical versus lateral fluxes.\n[25] Previous work on effective contributing area [e.g.,\nBarling et al., 1994; Grayson et al., 1997] still leaves our\nanalysis with a problem. The RNI is a contradiction in the\nsense that it uses a traditional topographic index derived\nfrom the upslope contributing area per unit length, identifies\nthe lowest value of the topographic index along a flow path,\nand then argues that this location controls the connectivity\nof points upstream of this location. Until this cell is\nconnecting upstream areas, locations downstream should\nbe assigned a much smaller effective contributing area.\nThus, the analysis has a bias: locations closer to the channel\nmay be assigned an artificially inflated upslope contributing\narea, and be more able to connect as a result. It is surprising\nFigure 6. Map of the Relative Network Index for the study area.\n8 of 10\nW08423 LANE ET AL.: HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY W08423\nthat this is not manifest in the form of a larger number of\nlocations that have a high RNI but that never actually\nconnect (Figure 4). Further, topography need not be the\nonly reason why the effective contributing area may be\ndifferent to a terrain-defined contributing area. For instance,\nAryal et al. [2003] demonstrate how evaporation along a\nflow path prevented the development of saturation at the\nbottom of a hillslope. AsWestern et al. [1999] note, analysis\nbased upon terrain indices should be based on consider-\nations of the actual processes occurring in a particular\ncatchment under a particular climate. Thus, while Figure 4\nsuggests that a static analysis of terrain can be transformed\ninto a probabilistic estimate of the likelihood of connection,\nthis will only be the case where the primary control on\nconnectivity at the landscape scale is topography. Further\nresearch is needed to explore whether the shape of the curve\ncan be generalized between catchments and in situations with\ndifferent and\/or heterogeneous land cover characteristics.\n[26] The effective contributing area bias aside, the result\nalso goes some way to explaining why simple empirical\ntransfer function models of diffuse pollution, which weight\ndelivery according to distance from the river channel, do\nwell as compared with what we know about the complexity\nof catchment hydrological response. They capture part of\nthe process described here: as the distance from a water\ncourse along a flow path increases, so the probability of the\nRNI value being lower will increase. To describe the\nconnection between the material exported from a land unit\nand its delivery to the river channel, a detailed representa-\ntion of hydrological function may not be necessary [Quinn,\n2004]. The work also shows how simple conceptual models\nabout where to focus diffuse pollution remediation measures\n(e.g., on catchment heads) themselves need to be ques-\ntioned: the data in Figure 6 show how that the zones of high\nconnectivity and hence high risk can vary regionally and\nover different spatial scales within the same catchment. The\nidentification of a topographically driven control upon\nlandscape hydrological connectivity also means that, as\nglobal change studies move to the consideration of climate\nchange impacts upon catchment function, simple models,\napplied at the resolution at which catchments connect\nhydrologically, may be more important than models with\na strong physical basis, but whose computational require-\nments or data availability requirements necessitate applica-\ntion at scales much coarser than those associated with\nhydrological response.\n6. Conclusion\n[27] We have compared the information on the spatial\npatterns of hydrological connectivity revealed by continu-\nous simulation using a physically based, distributed hydro-\nlogical model with a static descriptor of surface\nhydrological connectivity based upon the spatial structure\nof the topographic index of wetness. The latter is justified\nby the observation that the ease of connection by surface\noverland flow will be controlled by the extent to which\nlateral surface flux is dominant throughout a flow path. The\nlowest value of the topographic index along a flow path is\nassumed to be the point at which vertical fluxes, and hence\nthe propensity to disconnect, will be greatest. The lower the\nlowest value of the topographic index along a flow path, the\ngreater the level of catchment wetness required to cause\nwater table rise to the point at which lateral flux can be\nmaintained. This provides a theoretical rationale for the idea\nthat the temporal patterns (propensity, duration) of connec-\ntion might be captured using a static descriptor based upon\nthe spatial structure of topographically driven wetness.\nComparison with the results from continuous simulation\nshows that significant spatial variability in both the propen-\nsity to connection within a time period, as well as the\nduration of that connectivity, can be explained using this\nmetric. Although specifically formulated (and evaluated\nherein) for surface overland flow, the analysis ought to\napply equally for shallow subsurface flows and fluxes of\nmaterial in terms of vertical versus lateral fluxes, although\nthis needs to be tested for a wider range of catchment types.\nCritically, this provides a hydrologically informed measure\nof the propensity and duration of connection that might\nbecome the basis of more plausible analysis of the risks\narising from diffuse land use activities where, to date, the\ncharacterization of hydrologically driven delivery processes\ntends to be exceptionally poor.\n[28] Acknowledgments.
