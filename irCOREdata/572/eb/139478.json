The stiffeners \nare usually found as rack plates which aid in the raising and lowering of the jack-up via a rack and \npinion mechanism.  A survey of available literature reveals that considerable research effort has \nbeen directed towards an understanding of the effect of internal ring stiffeners in tubular joints as \nopposed to the effect of longitudinal stiffeners, nevertheless the rack plate has been observed to \nreduce the stress concentration at the brace\/chord intersection of stiffened joints.  Stiffeners which \nreduce the stress concentration in certain locations are suspected of introducing hot spots in other \nlocations and this indeed justifies the need for research into the effect of rack plates in jack-up \nchords. \n \nExtensive stress analyses of uni-planar tubular joints have been carried out in the past while \nmost studies of multi-planar joints have focused on an ultimate strength analysis.  Furthermore, the \nstudy of the effect of stiffeners has mainly focused on their application to uni-planar joints.  This \nparametric study involves a stress analysis of a rack plate stiffened multi-planar KK joint as shown \nin Fig. 1 below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nD = chord diameter \nz = rack thickness   \nd = brace diameter  \nT = chord wall thickness \n\u2126 = z\/D \n\u03b2 = d\/D \n\u03b3 =D\/2T \nFig. 1:  3D view of a stiffened KK tubular joint. \n \nThe stiffened multi-planar KK joint under investigation is an Integral part of the lattice legs of a \njack-up platform.  Each leg is a critical component of the jack-up as failure of one leg will lead to \nthe collapse of the whole structure.  An extensive understanding of possible crack sites in the KK \njoint, is achieved by this study and is a first step to prevent an eventual collapse of the platform due \nto fatigue cracking. \n \nA finite element stress analysis of over 120 models utilising a combination of 3D solid elements \nand 2D shell elements was employed for the purpose of this work with the ultimate goal of \ndeveloping parametric Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) equations to represent the hot spot stress \nat the brace\/chord intersection and any other location identified as a potential hot spot.  The study \nhas been restricted to axial and out-of-plane bending (OPB) loading modes while only 3 non-\ndimensional joint geometric parameters; \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u2126 were varied.  \n \nThe circular chord in Fig. 1 above was split to accommodate the continuous rack plate and is \ndescribed as the opposed pinion leg configuration of a jack-up wherein the KK joint is repeated \nthrough out the legs.  Other leg configurations exist, but this study focuses on the split tubular with \ncontinuous central rack.  In-plane bending (IPB) loads were not considered in this study because of \nthe negligible effect of the stiffener on the SCFs under IPB as identified by Myers et al [1].  Other \nnon-dimensional parameters by which a tubular joint can be described exist but the non-\ndimensional parameters selected for this study are believed to have the greatest effect on the SCFs \nin the joint under investigation. \nFEA and Parametric Study \nThe details of the FE analysis including mesh optimisation, refinement and convergence analyses \ncan be found in reference [2].  Several studies were conducted to verify the approach used against \npublished solutions for uni-planar tubular joints [3, 4].  Fig. 2 shows an example of a stress contour \nplot of a stiffened KK joint under OPB.  Fig. 3 illustrates the parametric matrix of FE models \nanalysed and the basis for the resulting parametric equations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Contour plot of a stiffened KK joint under OPB. \n \n \n0.3 \n0.4 \n0.5 \n0.54 \n4. 62 \n6 .00 \n8.00\n10.00\n0.16\n0.26\n0.36\n0.467 \nSingle Axial Single \nLoading modes\nz\nd\nD\n30o\n\u03b2 \n\u2126  \n\u03b3  \n \n \nFig. 3: Parametric matrix of FE models. \nParametric Equations \nThe SCFs extracted from each model were input into MINITAB for regression analysis while the \nnon-dimensional parameters were supplied as predictor variables.  The equations produced were \narrived at by trial and error.  The first sets of trials were aimed at achieving model equations with \ngood fit and minimal deviation from the data points (SCFs).  However, the relevance of this study \nto design necessitated that the equations should be conservative rather than to simply provide a best \nfit.  This was achieved by assessing the performance of the initial equations and then marking up \nthe FEA SCFs at all non-conservative points and marking down if required at conservative points.  \nThe regression analysis was then performed with the refined data.

The finite element procedure was \nverified against results for unstiffened tubular joints published in the available literature.  \n \nThree critical SCF locations were identified for each load case, with each location becoming the \nmost critical based on the combination of the non-dimensional parameters selected for the joint.  \nThe six equations describe the SCF at different critical locations as a function of the non-\ndimensional ratios.  In all cases, the final equations are conservative for more than 95% of the \nmodels analysed.  These new design equations not only allow the rapid optimisation of multi-planar \njoints but also can be used to quickly identify the location of maximum stress concentration and \nhence the likely position of any fatigue cracks.  This in itself is an invaluable tool for planning NDT \nprocedures and schedules.  It can be appreciated that where the maximum SCF is situated \ninternally, inspection becomes impossible and design penalties by certification authorities are \nlikely.  The equations developed here allow subtle changes in stiffener geometry to shift the critical \nSCF to external locations so that inspection becomes possible. \n  \nFuture work will involve experimental stress analysis of tubular joint specimens in order to \nverify the FEA based observations.  The validity range could be extended for design purposes and \nthe influence of other non-dimensional parameters investigated.  There is immense scope to develop \nthe idea of designing the location of maximum SCF for ease of inspection. \nReferences \n[1] Myers P. T., Brennan F. P. and Dover W.
