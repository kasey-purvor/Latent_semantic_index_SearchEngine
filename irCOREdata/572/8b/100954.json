The yrast states are observed above the region of the first backbend.\nIn each case this backbend is associated with the breaking of the first neutron (h11\/2)2 pair. The results are\nconsistent with the predictions of cranked shell model calculations and the systematics of neighboring nuclei.\n@S0556-2813~97!01904-3#\nPACS number~s!: 21.10.Re, 23.20.Lv, 25.70.2z, 27.60.1j\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe nuclei around Z;44 and N;60 are susceptible to\ndramatic changes in shape with the addition or subtraction of\na small number of nucleons @1#. The population of\ndeformation-driving, two-quasiparticle states can have a po-\nlarizing affect on the nuclear shape. Experimentally, the ob-\nservation of quasiparticle alignments ~or \u2018\u2018backbending\u2019\u2019!\ncan give useful information on the nature of those nucleons\nlying close to the Fermi surface, allowing the shape of the\nnuclear mean field to be inferred.\nFor Z;44 and N;60, the rotational alignment of both\nthe proton g9\/2 and neutron h11\/2 intruder orbitals can give\nrise to significant increases in aligned angular momentum.\nFor prolate shapes with b2;0.2, the Fermi surface lies close\nto the bottom of the low-V , h11\/2 neutron shell. For the\nneutron-rich nuclei around A;105, these orbitals slope\ndown steeply in energy with increasing prolate deformation.\nThe population of these states has been suggested as the\nmechanism behind the observation of weakly deformed, pro-\nlate, rotational bands in this region @2#. For oblate deforma-\ntions, at Z546, the low-V components of the proton g9\/2\norbitals are easily aligned and energetically favor collective\noblate shapes.\nIn the lighter ruthenium @3# and palladium nuclei @5,6#,\nbackbends are observed in the yrast sequences of the even-\neven isotopes which have been associated with the popula-\ntion of the prolate driving, two-quasi-neutron, (h11\/2)2 con-\nfiguration. However, Aryaeinejad et al. @4# suggest that the\nfirst band crossing observed in the neutron-rich palladium\nisotopes, 112,114,116Pd, is due to the oblate driving proton\n(g9\/2)2 quasiparticle alignment, suggesting an oblate de-\nformed core. It should be noted that in this work the align-\nment was not observed all the way through the backbend,\nand so the full increase in alignment could not be extracted.\nThe maximum aligned angular momentum which can be\ngenerated by a single pair of proton g9\/2 orbitals is 8\\ , while\nthe neutron h11\/2 orbitals can generate up to 10\\ . Thus for550556-2813\/97\/55~5!\/2305~9!\/$10.00observed increases in aligned angular momentum of between\n9\\ and 10\\ , a (nh11\/2)2 assignment would be preferred over\na (pg9\/2)2 one.\nFor neutron-rich nuclei, it is difficult to observe the yrast\nsequence through the backbend due to the preferential popu-\nlation of neutron-deficient species in fusion-evaporation re-\nactions and the low angular momentum involved in the fis-\nsion process. The identification of discrete gamma rays from\nneutron-rich fission fragments @4,7\u201312# has enabled the ob-\nservation of low to medium spin yrast states in a number of\nneutron-rich nuclei around A5100\u2013115. However, in fission\nsource studies, the experimentalist has a limited control over\nthe choice of reaction products, making it difficult to study\nspecific nuclei of interest.\nThe use of deep inelastic reactions to populate near-yrast\nstates in slightly neutron-rich nuclei is now well established\n@13\u201317# and provides an efficient way of studying the yrast\nstates of the most neutron-rich, stable isotopes in the\nA;105 region. In the current work we focus on the evolu-\ntion of the yrast states as a function of angular momentum in\nthree nuclei 42\n100Mo, 44\n104Ru, and 46\n108Pd, with particular atten-\ntion to the rotational alignments and what they reveal about\nthe underlying nuclear configurations.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND DATA ANALYSIS\nIn the current work a 5 mg\/cm2 thick, enriched ~99%!\n110Pd target on a 20 mg\/cm2 208Pb backing was bombarded\nwith a 395 MeV 86Kr beam provided by the K130 cyclotron\nin the accelerator laboratory at the University of Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8.\nSystematic studies of deep inelastic reactions suggest that the\nnuclei produced with the highest cross section have neutron-\nto-proton ratios similar to the compound system @18#. Note\nthat the proton-to-neutron ratios for the beam and target nu-\nclei are approximately equal ('0.72! and the Z:N ratios for\n42\n100Mo, 44\n104Ru and 46\n108Pd are 0.72, 0.73, and 0.74 respec-\ntively.\nGamma rays from decays in both the targetlike and pro-\njectilelike fragments were measured using an array of 122305 \u00a9 1997 The American Physical Society\n2306 55P. H. REGAN et al.Compton-suppressed TESSA-type @19#, hyperpure germa-\nnium detectors. The detectors were placed in four rings of\nthree detectors each, at angles of 38\u00b0, 78\u00b0, 102\u00b0, and 142\u00b0 to\nthe beam direction. Each individual gamma-ray event was\naccompanied by a time signal relative to the beam burst\nwhich enabled good separation between prompt events ~in-\nbeam! and delayed events from isomeric states or b decay.\nData were written to tape for Compton-suppressed\ngamma-gamma coincidence events. Approximately 4.5\n310 8 in-beam, unfolded gamma-gamma events were sorted\ninto the form of a gamma-gamma matrix, from which\nbackground-subtracted coincidence gates could be set. Fig-\nure 1~a! shows a total projection spectrum for this matrix.\nNote that the data are dominated by the Coulomb excitation\nof the 110Pd target.\nThe data were analyzed using the gamma-ray analysis\nprograms GF2 and ESCL8R @20#. Because of the relatively\nlarge number of nuclei formed in this type of reaction, the\ngates frequently have to be manipulated in order to obtain\n\u2018\u2018clean\u2019\u2019 ~uncontaminated! spectra. Figure 1 shows a typical\nexample using a gamma-gamma coincidence gate set on the\n764 keV transition in 104Ru. Clearly, the background-\nsubtracted gate contains many lines which, rather than being\nin coincidence with the 104Ru transition, are due to the over-\nlap of the tails from peaks either side of the 764 keV transi-\ntion which are unresolved in the 764 keV gate. When the\ncontributions from these gates are subtracted from the 764\nkeV gate, the residual spectrum contains only transitions\nFIG. 1. ~a!

In the three nuclei\ndiscussed in the present work, 46\n108Pd was accompanied by\ntransitions from 36\n84\u201388Kr, 44\n104Ru was accompanied by transi-\ntions from 38\n87\u201390Sr, and 42\n100Mo was accompanied by transi-\ntions from 40\n91\u201393Zr. ~At the limit of our experimental sensi-\ntivity, we do not observe proton evaporation from the binary\nreaction products.!\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe decay schemes for 100Mo, 104Ru and 108Pd, as de-\nduced in the current work, are shown in Fig. 2. Examples of\nthe gamma-gamma coincidence spectra used to construct\nthese decay schemes are shown in Figs. 1 and 3. The inten-\nsities quoted are taken from the gamma-gamma coincidence\ndata fitted using the ESCL8R program @20#. This information\nis summarized for 100Mo, 104Ru, and 108Pd in Tables I, II,\nand III, respectively. The intensities of the 21!01 transi-\ntions were obtained by comparing their intensities as ob-\nserved in gates set on strong lines in the complementary\nfragment nuclei. These intensities have been renormalized so\nthat the 21!01 transition in each nucleus has an intensity\nof 1000 units.\nA. Spin and parity assignments\nThe assignment of transition multipolarities ~and thus\nlevel spins! in high-spin studies is usually achieved using an\nangular distribution or directional correlation analysis @21#.\nIn the current work, neither was possible due to ~a! the large\nnumber of nuclei produced, which means that the singles\ndata are heavily contaminated; ~b! a general lack of statistics\nin the DCO ~angle-gated! g-g data; and most importantly ~c!\na destruction of the reaction alignment in the binary breakup\nprocess.\nThe spin assignments given in this work are based on the\nobserved decay characteristics of individual states. Where it\nexists, we have assumed results from previously published\ndata @22\u201324# and then made tentative assignments of the\nspins of previously unobserved states from their decay pat-\nterns into the known states. We have made tentative assign-\nments for the level spins using the usual assumption that,\ntypically, near-yrast decays are favored, and thus the as-\nsigned spins increase with excitation energy. This assump-\ntion is at least partially verified in the present work by the\nlack of observation of many previously identified nonyrast,\nlow-lying states. We have limited the assigned multipolari-\nties of the decays to either DI51, (M1\/E2 or E1) or\nDI52, E2 transitions ~since prompt M2 decays in transi-\ntional nuclei are rare!. In general, the likelihood of a\nDI50, J!J transition has been disregarded on the basis that\nthis implies a nonyrast nature for the decaying state although\nwe note that such decays cannot be ruled out in the present\nwork.\nB. Decay scheme of 100Mo\nPrevious work on this nucleus includes the study of low-\nspin states following the b2 decay of 100Nb @25#, two-\n55 2307OBSERVATION OF (h11\/2)2 NEUTRON ALIGNMENTS . . .FIG. 2. Partial decay schemes of 100Mo, 104Ru, and 108Pd obtained in the present work.neutron transfer through the (t ,p) reaction @26#, and Cou-\nlomb excitation @27#. Each of these studies allowed the spin\nand parity of the yrast 21, 41, and 61 states at 536, 1136,\nand 1848 keV to be confidently assigned. The study by Hook\net al. @28# using the 96Zr(7Li,p2n)100Mo reaction, identified\nthe yrast states up to the 101 state at 3368 keV, with the\n~121) state tentatively assigned as lying at 4063 keV. Fis-\nsion studies reported by Durell @8# suggested a tentative\n~141) state at 4875 keV decaying via an 812 keV transition\nto this tentative ~121) state. The excitation energies of these\nstates are confirmed in the present work.\nTwo previously unreported states at 2340 and 2844 keV\nhave been observed in the current study. The 2340 keV state\nis observed to decay only to the yrast 41 state, restricting\nlikely spins to 5\\ or 6\\ for this state. ~A spin\/parity of 41\nfor the 2340 keV state is unlikely as one might expect to\nobserve an E2 decay to the yrast 21 state, yet no such decay\nis seen in the present study.! By a similar argument, limits of\n7\\ and 8\\ can be made for the spin of the 2844 keV state.\nThe observation of the 503 keV transition which links the\n2844 and 2340 keV states implies a spin difference of no\nmore than 2\\ between these two levels. On the basis of these\narguments, we favor tentative assignments of 56 and 76 for\nthese states, respectively.\nC. 99Mo h11\/2 band\nThe published data on the 112 2 band in 99Mo @40# extends\nto a spin-192 2 state. We have identified a firm candidate for\nthe ( 232 2) member of the decoupled h11\/2 band in 99Mo\nwhich decays via a 845 keV transition ~see Fig. 4!. The ob-\nservation of the extension of this band is important in terms\nof blocking effects and the subsequent interpretation of the\nbackbends in the even-even isotopes ~see later!.D. Decay scheme of 104Ru\nLevels in 104Ru have previously been studied in b2 decay\n@29,30#, inelastic deuteron scattering @31#, Coulomb excita-\ntion @23,24,32#, massive transfer @3#, and the study of fission\nproducts @8#. Only the near-yrast states identified during\nthese studies are observed in the current work. The spins and\nparities of the yrast states up to the 3112 keV level at spin\n101 have been deduced from Coulomb excitation studies by\nStachel et al. @23,24#.\nThe yrast positive-parity band is in agreement with the\nprevious work of Haenni et al. @3#, Stachel et al. @23,24#, and\nDurell @8# and has been extended for the first time through\nthe first backbend up to a ~141) state at 4439 keV. We have\nassumed that the 602 and 726 keV transitions decaying from\nthe 3714 and 4439 keV states are stretched E2 transitions\nforming the continuation of the yrast band.\nA number of previously unobserved, nonyrast states\nwhich decay into the yrast sequence have also been identified\nin the current work. These are the 1975, 2233, 2601, 2614,\n3075, 3285, and 3690 keV levels. The spin\/parity assign-\nments for these states are discussed below.\n1975 keV state. The 1975 keV state has a tentative assign-\nment of (62)\\ or 7\\ on the basis of its only observed decay\nto the yrast 61 state at 1557 keV. If the 1975 keV state had\na spin of 81, it would be yrast and one might expect it to\nhave a rather stronger intensity, although such an assignment\ncan not be ruled out in the present work. Similarly, for spin\nassignments of 61 or lower spins, one would expect to see a\ndecay branch to the 41 state at 889 keV.\n2233, 2614, 3075, and 3690 keV states. The makeup of\nthe decay scheme suggests that these states are all members\nof a collective structure based on the same intrinsic configu-\nration. ~Negative-parity sidebands from the coupling of the\nh11\/2 and a d5\/2 \/g7\/2 orbital are a common feature of the yrast\nstates of this region @22#.!

Similar decay arguments restrict the assignment of the\n2614 keV state to 76 or 81 and the 3075 keV state to 8\\\nor 9\\ .2601 keV state. The observed decay of this state limits its\npossible spin and parity assignments to 76 or 81. While a\n62 assignment is possible, it is unlikely, particularly since\nthe 2197 keV, 61 member of the gamma vibrational band\n55 2309OBSERVATION OF (h11\/2)2 NEUTRON ALIGNMENTS . . .TABLE I.

From the decay of this state via the 964\nkeV line to the yrast 81 state, likely spin\/parity assignments\ncan be restricted to 96 or 101.\nE. Decay scheme of 108Pd\nStates upto spin 81 in this nucleus have recently been the\nfocus of a study by Svensson et al. @33# using Coulomb ex-\ncitation. High-spin states up to a tentative ~101) state ~popu-\nlated via the decay of fission fragments! have been reported\nin this nucleus by Durell @8#. The recent study of the near\nyrast states of 108Pd by Pohl et al. @22# using the 96Zr(18O,\na2n) reaction extended the yrast band up to a tentative spin\n~18\\) and identified a candidate for the yrast negative-parity\nband. The decay scheme observed in the present work is\nconsistent with this recent study and spin\/parity assignments\nare taken from that work. In agreement with Ref. @22#, the\ntentative 101 state reported by Durell @8# at 3350 keV isobserved but a lower lying 101 state at 3256 keV which\ndecays via the 708 keV gamma ray is the yrast state for this\nspin. This has important consequences when deducing the\nincrease in aligned angular momentum through this crossing.\nThe state at 2842 keV which decays via the 1071 keV\ntransition to the yrast 61 state at 1771 keV has not been\npreviously reported and we assign possible spin\/parities for\nthis state of 76 or 81.\nIV.

This is consistent with\nthe alignment of the (h11\/2)2 neutrons as predicted by MathurFIG. 4.

As Fig. 6 shows,\nthe few states available for the h11\/2 band in 99Mo show that\nas in the h11\/2 bands in 103Ru and 107Pd the first ~AB! band\ncrossing is clearly blocked. This blocking effect adds consid-\nerable credence to the (nh11\/2)2 interpretation for the first\nalignment in 100Mo.\nOne might speculate that the states at 2340 and 2843 keV\nin 100Mo are negative-parity two-quasiparticle states basedon the coupling of the h11\/2 neutron orbital with a d5\/2 \/g7\/2\nstate. The excitation energy of these states is close to the\nestimated value of twice the neutron pair gap ~2Dn'2.4\nMeV! and such states are well known in other N558 iso-\ntones such as 104Pd and 106Cd @5,42#.\nB. 104Ru\nThe observed increase in alignment of ~9!10! \\ is also\nconsistent with the (h11\/2)2 crossing and too large for the\nproton (g9\/2)2 alignment. This interpretation is supported by\nthe CSM calculations for 104Ru ~see Fig. 5! which predict the\n2312 55P. H. REGAN et al.(nh11\/2)2 alignment (AB) to occur at a frequency of approxi-\nmately 0.3 MeV\/\\ . The alignment for the 112 2 band in\n103Ru @3# shows this AB band crossing to be blocked @see\nFig. 6~b!#, again consistent with the (nh11\/2)2 alignment in-\nterpretation for 104Ru. The excitation energy of the first\n11\n2\n2 state lies at only 209 keV @41# in 105Ru ~compared to\n434 keV in 103Ru!, but unfortunately no states are known in\nthe band built on this state; so the alignment for this band\ncannot be deduced. However, the lowering of the energy of\nthe yrast 112 2 state with increasing neutron number is consis-\ntent with the h11\/2 neutron orbital lying close to the Fermi\nsurface for 104Ru.\nThe states at 1995, 2233, 2602, and 2614 keV are all at\nexcitation energies consistent with two-quasiparticle states,\nbut in the absence of firm spin\/parity assignments, no further\ninterpretation can be made. The tentative ~101) state at 3285\nkeV is a candidate for the continuation of the yrare, quasivi-\nbrational ground state configuration after the first band cross-\ning.\nFIG. 6.

The data for these points come from\nthe present work and Refs. @3,5,6,8,22,37,38,40#.C. 108Pd\nIt has been suggested that there is change from prolate to\noblate deformation in the palladium isotopes @4# with oblate\nshapes preferred for neutron numbers 64 and above.\nAryaeinejad et al. @4# have argued oblate deformations for\n112,114,116Pd on the basis of the observed rotational frequen-\ncies of the first alignment for these nuclei, which occurs at\nv;0.35 MeV\/\\ . The authors of Ref. @4# suggest that this is\nconsistent with the (pg9\/2)2 crossing which is predicted to\noccur at a lower frequency than the (nh11\/2)2 alignment for\noblate shapes. ~However, this situation is reversed for weakly\ndeformed prolate deformations.! Unfortunately, the back-\nbends observed in 112,114,116Pd do not progress through the\nfull alignment and thus the total increase in aligned angular\nmomentum through these backbends has not yet been estab-\nlished.\nIn 108Pd, the CSM calculations suggest that the first align-\nment is due to the prolate driving, low-V (h11\/2)2 neutron\nconfiguration @22#, consistent with the observed gain in an-\ngular momentum of ~9!10!\\ . As in the 100Mo and 104Ru\nyrast bands, this increase in aligned angular momentum is\ntoo large to be accounted for by the proton (g9\/2)2 alignment.\nAs Fig. 6~b! shows, the first alignment in 108Pd is blocked in\nthe one-quasineutron 112 2 band in 107Pd, consistent with a\n(h11\/2)2 alignment in 108Pd.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe yrast states of the b-stable nuclei 100Mo, 104Ru, and\n108Pd have been studied to medium spins using deep inelas-\ntic collisions. In each case, the yrast sequence extends past\nthe first band crossing with an increase in aligned angular\nmomentum of approximately 10\\ . This pattern is well repro-\nduced by cranked shell model calculations and the systemat-\nics of the neighboring nuclei, all of which suggest that the\nneutron (h11\/2)2 alignment is energetically favored over the\nground state configurations at spins of 10\\ and above.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge R.
