INTRODUCTION \nThe management of events,  people or organizations in \ndynamically changing environments requires both \nknowledge of pre-defined plans and procedures, and \n\u2018softer\u2019 skills such as; communication and understanding \nof information under conditions of stress, problem-solving \nwith partial or contradictory information, and decision-\nmaking in the face of competing demands [1].  Programs \ndesigned to train soft skills should ideally expose students \nto exactly those sorts of stressful, uncertain and \ndynamically changing environments [2].  Constructing \nsuch training exercises with traditional role-playing \nmethodologies can be an expensive, laborious task, which \nfurthermore lacks the engagement inherent in a real \nscenario [3].  However, modern computer game \ntechnology appears to represent an ideal tool for presenting \nand controlling complex, engaging and dynamically \nchanging environments and may prove to be useful tools in \nthe training of soft skills [3, 4]. \nThe work described here is being conducted as part of \nan EU LEONARDO project named DREAD-ED, which \naims to provide game-based soft skills training to \nemergency management personnel (see http:\/\/www.dread-\ned.eu for further information). Emergencies generally \nconstitute unpredictable, stressful environments and are \nmanaged by groups of people drawn from various \ndisciplines and agencies.  Importantly, the process of \nmanaging an emergency requires group members to \ncommunicate effectively and engage in collaborative \ndecision making in order to solve the problems presented \n[5]. \nThis paper presents the process of designing computer \ngame to function as part of a soft skills training program, \nas well as an evaluation of a table top game designed to \nengage players in appropriate collaborative decision \nmaking behavior.  Some brief conclusions and an outline \nof proposed future work are also presented.    \nII. BACKGROUND \nWhile the term \u2018soft skills\u2019 is not common within \nsocial psychology  literature, a large amount of research \nhas been carried out on precisely these skills, and many \nfactors have been judged to play a role in the quality of \ncollaborative decisions made by groups.  The literature \nsuggests that \u201cgroup decision making can be biased and \nineffective and that conditions must be created for group \nmembers to share information and make decisions [6].\u201d It \nis suggested that efforts must be made to specifically train \ngroup members in the process of effective group decision-\nmaking.  For example, groups that are characterized by an \nequality of member participation make higher quality \ndecisions than groups that are dominated a minority of \nindividuals [7]. Thus, groups should be trained to adopt a \nsystematic structure for discussions that promote \nparticipation and sharing of information by all group \nmembers [7].  \nLittle research has been conducted on designing games \nspecifically as tools for training soft skills.  However, \nresearch has indicated that computer games can prove to \nbe innovative and powerful tools for learning and \neducation, if appropriate attention is given to incorporating \n\u201csound cognitive, learning, and pedagogical principles into \ntheir design and structure [8].\u201d Unfortunately, a large \nnumber of educational, or serious, games appear to have \nignored the principles that typically inform educational \nmaterials [8], particularly in regard to two issues; 1) \nembedding learning outcomes within the game mechanics \n[9], and, 2) providing immediate and specific feedback to \nparticipants regarding their behaviour [10].   \nBogost [9] describes the process of embedding the \nlearning outcomes of a serious game within the game play \nmechanics as constituting procedural rhetoric.  The author \ndescribes a number of serious games that are deficient in \nprocedural rhetoric (p. 49-51).  These games simply \nborrow the game play mechanics of traditional games and \napply novel graphical skins to them.  It is entirely possible \nto play these games successfully while remaining oblivious \nto the desired learning outcomes.  The learning is not \nembedded within the game play mechanics, rather the \nplayer is presumed to infer the correct message from \nplaying the game.  Conversely, Bogost mentions a number \nof games, such as The McDonalds Videogame (p. 29) \nwhich excels in embedding the learning outcomes within \nthe game mechanics, thus constituting superior tools for \neducation.   \n2009 Conference in Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications\n978-0-7695-3588-3\/09 $25.00 \u00a9 2009 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109\/VS-GAMES.2009.9\n182\n2009 Conference in Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications\n \nFig. 1. Illustration of the structure of a game play session \n \nThe specificity of feedback provided by a manual or \ncognitive skills training program is a reliable predictor of \nfuture performance of those skills [10]. Specifically, \nfeedback provided to participants by the game should be \nboth immediate and specific to the actions taken.   Driving \ninstruction courses provide a good example of skills \ntraining methodologies.  In these courses, the instructor \nexamines the behavior of the learner as they drive and \ndelivers timely and specific feedback concerning the \nproficiency of the learners\u2019 driving.  Allowing a learner to \ndrive for thirty minutes before producing a list of mistakes \nwould not allow the learner to effectively discern which of \nthe many actions taken were appropriate, and which were \nnot. \nIt appears that an effective serious game designed to \nteach soft skills should involve game-based problem-\nsolving that delivers clear, timely and specific feedback to \nplayers.  The current project aims to fulfill these criteria in \ntwo ways.  Firstly, it appears that the desired learning \noutcomes must be embedded within the game play \nmechanics.  The learning outcome of the current project is \nimproved group decision making skills.  Hence, the game \npresents an environment where it is advantageous to \nengage in the appropriate group decision making and \ncommunication behaviors.   Groups that do not work \ncollaboratively to solve the problems presented in the \ngame should perform poorly. Thus, the learning is \nembedded within the game play mechanics and the game \nstate itself provides feedback on how well the group is \nperforming in terms of soft skills.   \nSecondly, the game design breaks long and complex \ndisaster scenarios into a number of shorter, simpler ones.  \nEssentially, there are a number of short collaboration \nsessions where participants can collaborate to alleviate the \nimmediate risks presented by the dynamically changing \ngame state.  These collaboration sessions are separated by \nshort feedback phases, where a tutor has the opportunity to \ndeliver specific feedback to groups or individuals with \nreference to the behavior observed in the previous \ncollaboration phase, in order to improve the collaborative \nprocesses of the group.   \n A table top prototype of the soft skills training \ngame is reported below. Table top prototyping is an \nestablished method of refining a game design concept into \na fully functional game [11]. The process typically \ninvolves the creation of a board game that encapsulates the \ngame mechanics desired for the final game.  Participants \nplay this board game while designers observe the balance \nof variables within the game, analyze the pattern of \ninformation flow between players and refine the game \nmechanics, where appropriate [12].  The following section \ndescribes the table top prototype created during the \ndevelopment of a soft skills training game.   \nIII. A BOARD GAME PROTOTYPE FOR SOFT SKILLS \nTRAINING \nThe game reported here places players in a crisis \nmanagement team that is dealing with an immediate and \ndeveloping emergency situation. Figure 1 presents an \nillustration of the structure of a game play session.  There \nare three stages to each session.  Initially, conditions are \nset by the particular scenario chosen for the training \nsession.  Game play is organized into a series of timed \nrounds, each separated by a phase in which a tutor has the \nopportunity to give feedback to players.  Once the \nprescribed number of timed rounds have elapsed, an in-\ndepth evaluation phase is initiated between the tutor and \nthe participants.   \nIt must be noted that for the purposes of the initial \nevaluation reported in this paper, the role of tutor was left \nunfulfilled.  Rather, this trial was concerned with \nevaluating whether the game play mechanics did or did not \nrequire participants to engage in the sorts of soft skills that \nthe DREAD-ED project aims to teach.  As such, the \nfeedback phase in this evaluation merely consisted of a \nshort break from the collaborative sessions and an \nopportunity to organize the game pieces.  \nThe game mechanic is based on assembling teams of \nsimilarly skilled personnel in order to affect the game state, \nas represented by a number of scales, thereby controlling \nthe emergency situation.  The personnel are represented by \na deck of custom made cards, each one displaying the \nname of the personnel class to which that card belongs, \nplus a function that it has within the game.  Players receive \nsix of these cards each and have the option of exchanging \ncards with other players, or with a reserve of unseen cards.  \nIn addition, each player is randomly assigned a particular \nrole that allows them to alter the game state in a very \nspecific way.  A player\u2019s role is to collaborate and \nnegotiate with the other members of the team to manage \nthe emergency situation by gathering together and \ndeploying teams of specialists in order to reduce the \nimpact of the developing emergency.  A high-achieving \ngroup will excel at getting the right personnel to the right \nplayers at the right time in order to control the emergency.  \nFigure 2 constitutes a graphic illustration of the scales used \nin the table top prototype to represent the game state. \nA mechanism was developed to control the exchanging \nof cards between players, so that only a certain number of \nactions are possible per round.  Specifically, each group \nwas given a collective allocation of \u2018action pieces\u2019 that \ncould be used in each collaboration phase.  Groups had to \ndecide collectively on how to use these action pieces.  This \nmechanic, coupled with the limited time available for \ndiscussion and collaboration, was designed to engender the \nsort of strategic decision making typically necessary or \nmanaging emergencies.   \n183\nIn addition, at specific points, \u2018injects\u2019 of information \nare introduced that alter the game state in an unpredictable \nfashion.  These occur both at the beginning of each \ncollaboration phase and when a player deploys a personnel \nteam.  In this way, the game presents an unpredictable \ndynamically changing environment that models the \nuncertainty and stress typically associated with managing \nemergencies.   \nIt must be noted that the version of the game used for \nthe current evaluation did not contain any narrative content \nbeyond the names of personnel and role cards.  Rather, a \nskeletal structure comprising just the values assigned to \neach card or class was included.  This step was taken in \norder to concentrate purely on the effectiveness of the \ngame mechanics, rather than the engagement created by a \nnarrative structure.  Future versions of the game will \ninclude detailed narrative structures as part of the game \nplay scenarios. \n \n \nFig. 2. An illustration of the scales used in the table top prototype to \nrepresent the game state. \n \nTwenty-four undergraduate students were recruited for \nthe study and assigned to four groups of six participants in \nan ad-hoc manner.  No effort was made to carefully \nconstruct groups as representative samples of the \npopulation, as we were not interested in extrapolating \ngeneralized findings about the participants themselves, or \ngroup processes in general.  This study was an initial \nevaluation of the game design only, and as such was \nconducted purely to evaluate whether the game design \nprovoked collaborative behavior.   \nIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of the board game \nas a tool for training soft skills, the four groups were \ncasually observed by researchers while playing the game.  \nAs an aside, an objective method of quantifying \ncollaborative behavior in games is being developed also as \npart of the DREAD-ED project, but this was not available \nat the time of the current study.  Additionally, \nquestionnaires that probed the game play mechanics, \nstrategies developed by players and weighting issues were \ndistributed on completion of game play. \n \n \n \nFig. 3.  Participants playing the table top prototype game. \n \nObservations indicated that in three of the four six-\nmember groups, there appeared to be a great deal of \ncommunication between group members and forward \nplanning was in evidence.  These groups appeared to be \nhighly engaged with the game and seemed to display very \ngood collaborative decision-making.  In addition, group \nparticipation appeared to become more equal as the game \nprogressed.  In essence, the game appeared to produce an \nenvironment in which it was advantageous to engage in the \nskills that were targeted at the outset of the project.  The \nremaining group communicated less well throughout, and \nconsequently performed poorly at the game. At the \nmoment, the question of \u2018why\u2019 one group performed worse \nthan the others is beyond the scope of this research.  \nRather, it is important to note that while this group did not \nseem to be adapting their behavior according to the \nfeedback provided dynamically by the game state, in a full \nversion of the game, the feedback provided by a tutor \nduring the feedback phases may have been enough to \nprovoke the appropriate collaborative behavior.  \nQuestionnaire responses generally correlated with \nobservations.  Players reported that team work, \ncommunication and a lack of selfishness were essential for \nsuccess at the game.  One participant reported, \u201cIt was only \nonce we began discussing our possible moves at the \nbeginning of every turn that we managed to stabilize our \nsituation in the game.  The game forced us to work as a \nteam, or fail.\u201d  It appears that the design is fit for the \npurposes intended; creating an environment where it is \nadvantageous to engage in positive and collaborative group \ndecision making, while promoting communication skills.   \n \nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK \nInitial findings suggest that the game design adopted in \nthe current project successfully created an environment \nwhere it was advantageous to engage in collaborative \ngroup decision making.  Three of the four groups that \nparticipated displayed collaborative and inclusive decision \nmaking processes that were refined over successive \nrounds.  Crucially, the game design, where there are a \nlarge number of feedback stages in between the timed \ngame play phases, allows scope for a tutor to identify \nunproductive behaviors in individuals and groups, and to \n184\nhelp engender more appropriate behaviors through \nrehearsal. \nThe board game reported in the current paper \nrepresented the skeletal structure of the game mechanic.  \nPlayers were managing numbers and cards, rather than \ninformation relevant to emergency management.  The next \nstep in the design process is to create a board game that \nincludes a narrative structure, but maintains the mechanics \nof the basic prototype. \nAs mentioned above, a methodology for quantifying \ncollaborative behavior in games is also currently under \ndevelopment as part of the DREAD-ED project.  This \nmethodology will assess the structure and quality of group \ndecision making processes within the game, based on both \nobjective observations and social network analyses.  In \naddition, it is intended that this methodology will be \nrefined and validated over an extended period, in order to \nserve as a useful tool both for this project and other \ncollaborative environments.  Crucially, it is intended that \nthis tool will plug into the final online version of the soft \nskills training game.   \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was carried out as part of the \"Leonardo\" \nproject \"DREAD-ED: Disaster Readiness through \nEducation\" funded by the EU Lifelong Learning \nProgramme (see http:\/\/www.dread-ed.eu\/ \n<http:\/\/www.dread-ed.eu\/> \nREFERENCES \n[1] K.
