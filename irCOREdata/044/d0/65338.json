Comparing faces to non-face objects elicited activation in all visual areas of \nthe cortical face processing network that were spared subsequent to brain damage. The common brain \nlesion in the two patients was in the right inferior occipital cortex, in the territory of the right \u201coccipital \nface area\u201d (\u2018OFA\u2019), which strengthens the critical role of this region in processing faces. Despite the \nlesion to the right \u2018OFA\u2019, there was normal range of sensitivity to faces in the right \u201cfusiform face \narea\u201d (\u2018FFA\u2019) in both patients, supporting a non-hierarchical model of face processing at the cortical \nlevel. At the same time, however, sensitivity to individual face representations, as indicated by release \nfrom adaptation to identity, was abnormal in the right \u2018FFA\u2019 of both patients. This suggests that the \nright \u2018OFA\u2019 is necessary to individualize faces, perhaps through reentrant interactions with other \ncortical face sensitive areas. The lateral occipital area (LO) is damaged bilaterally in patient DF, who \nalso shows visual object agnosia. However, in patient PS, in whom LO was spared, sensitivity to \nindividual representations of non-face objects was still found in this region, as in the normal brain, \nconsistent with her preserved object recognition abilities. Taken together, these observations, which \nfruitfully combine functional imaging and neuropsychology, place strong constraints on the possible \nfunctional organization of the cortical areas mediating face processing in the human brain. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: face perception, face recognition, prosopagnosia, fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital cortex, \nfMRI, FFA, OFA, LOC. \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \nDespite its apparent simplicity, deriving a full percept of an individual face is one of the most \ncomplex tasks performed by the human visual system. Lesion studies (e.g. Damasio et al., 1982; \nSergent & Signoret, 1992), intracranial recordings (Allison et al., 1994) and functional neuroimaging \ninvestigations (e.g. Sergent et al., 1992; Haxby et al., 2000) of the human brain have shown that this \nfunction relies primarily on a network of areas located in the occipitotemporal cortex. Functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in particular have shown that a subset of these areas \npresent a strong preferential response to faces, including the so-called \u201cfusiform face area\u201d (\u2018FFA\u2019, e.g. \nKanwisher et al., 1997) in the middle fusiform gyrus, the \u201coccipital face area\u201d in the inferior occipital \ncortex (\u2018OFA\u2019, e.g. Gauthier et al., 2000), as well as an area located in the posterior part of the superior \ntemporal sulcus (pSTS; e.g. Puce et al., 1998). These three bilateral areas, which show a strong right \nhemisphere advantage, are thought to form the core system for normal face perception (Haxby et al., \n2000; Ishai, 2008). \nIn an attempt to further clarify the functional neuroanatomy of face perception, a few fMRI \nstudies (Marotta et al., 2001; Rossion et al., 2003; Steeves et al., 2006) have measured neural responses \nto pictures of faces in neurological patients suffering from prosopagnosia \u2013 the inability to \nindividualize faces following brain damage (Quaglino & Borelli, 1867; Bodamer, 1947). A detailed \ninvestigation of patient PS, a rare case of prosopagnosia without visual object agnosia, showed right \nhemisphere \u2018FFA\u2019 activation despite a structurally damaged right inferior occipital cortex and no \nevidence of right \u2018OFA\u2019 activation (Rossion et al., 2003; Sorger et al., 2007). In a similar vein, this \nobservation of right \u2018FFA\u2019 activation without ipsilateral \u2018OFA\u2019 was also recently reported in patient DF \n(Steeves et al. 2006), who suffers from visual form agnosia (an inability to recognize objects based on \nshape) in addition to prosopagnosia (Milner et al., 1991). This latter patient has extensive bilateral \ndamage to lateral occipital cortex and shows no evidence of \u2018OFA\u2019 activation in either hemisphere. \n 4 \nTaken together, these observations place strong constraints on the neurofunctional organization of face \nperception in the normal brain (Rossion, 2008). First, they indicate that the right \u2018OFA\u2019 \u2013 the common \nregion within the face-preferential cortical network that is damaged in both patients \u2013 must be a critical \ncomponent of the face perception network. This observation is corroborated by a recent retrospective \nanalysis of the overlap of human patient lesions from structural MRI (Bouvier & Engel, 2006). Second, \nthese observations suggest that, in contrast to a hierarchical feedforward model for face perception \n(Haxby et al., 2000; Ishai, 2008), the \u2018FFA\u2019 can be activated without ipsilateral \u2018OFA\u2019 inputs, perhaps \nthrough direct functional connections originating from striate and extrastriate cortical areas (Rossion, \n2008).  \nMore recent neuroimaging studies of patient PS have shown that the fMRI signal in the right \n\u2018FFA\u2019, despite showing a normal range of preferential activation to faces, does not show any evidence \nof sensitivity to discrimination of individual faces (Schiltz et al., 2006; Dricot et al., 2008). \nSpecifically, the fMRI response in this area fails to show a larger response for faces of different \nidentities (presented in a block or as pairs of face stimuli) compared to the presentation of faces of the \nsame identity. This stands in contrast to the strong effect of a release from adaptation with fMRI for \ndifferent face identities that is found in this area in the normal healthy brain (e.g.; Gauthier et al., 2000; \nGrill-Spector & Malach, 2001; Winston et al., 2004; Schiltz et al., 2006) or even in patients with \ncongenital prosopagnosia (Avidan et al., 2005). This observation supports the hypothesis that a critical \nrole of the right \u2018OFA\u2019 in face perception is not simply to detect and categorize a stimulus as a face \u2013 a \nfunction that is preserved for both PS and DF \u2013 but more importantly to assist in deriving an individual \nfine-grained face representation, perhaps through reentrant interactions between the \u2019FFA\u2019 and the \n\u2018OFA\u2019 (Rossion et al., 2003; Schiltz et al., 2006; Rossion, 2008). \nAs a result, this proposal would necessarily predict that face identity coding \u2013 as tested through \nfMRI adaptation \u2013 should also be impaired in the \u2018FFA\u2019 of patient DF. This critical test was the main \n 5 \ngoal of the present collaborative study, in which we sought to test and contrast both patients in an \nidentical face identity adaptation paradigm. Our objectives were threefold. First, we aimed to replicate \nthe observation of face-preferential activation in the fusiform gyrus (\u2018FFA\u2019) in patient DF that had been \npreviously demonstrated using a block design (Steeves et al., 2006) but in the present experiment using \nan event-related fMRI paradigm. This paradigm is more conservative, in that it is less sensitive to \npotential confounds of subject\u2019s expectations and attentional biases when compared to the block design \nface localizer used previously. Second, we sought to test the hypothesis that patient DF\u2019s \u2018FFA\u2019 in both \nhemispheres would show a larger response to faces compared to objects, yet would be insensitive to \ndifferences in face identity unlike normal controls. Finally, while patient PS has normal object \nperception (\u2018pure prosopagnosia\u2019), DF is profoundly impaired in both face and object perception, in \nparticular when she has to discriminate individual exemplars of the same object class (Humphrey et al., \n1994). Hence, given that the \u2018FFA\u2019 also shows a robust response to non-face objects (e.g. Grill-Spector \net al., 2006), we sought to test and compare release from adaptation in fMRI to both object and face \nidentity in the two patients. Our predictions were 1) an absence of adaptation effects for face identity in \nthe both patients in the FFA and 2) significant adaptation effects for object identity in patient PS in the \nright \u2018FFA\u2019, but not for patient DF in either FFA. \nFinally, it is important to note that we compare and contrast neuroimaging data from two brain-\ndamaged patients in the same neuroimaging experiment\u2014patients who have been studied extensively \nand characterized previously as single case studies by independent research groups\u2014and the present \nwork provides a unique opportunity to strengthen our understanding of the functional neuroanatomy of \nface and object perception in both the healthy and neurologically damaged human brain. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nMaterials and Methods \nSubjects \n 6 \nPatient DF is a female, 51 years of age at the time of testing, whose neuropsychological profile \nhas been described in detail previously (e.g., Milner et al., 1991; Humphrey et al., 1994; James et al., \n2003; Servos et al., 1993). Her primary neurological symptoms are profound visual form agnosia and \nprosopagnosia. She shows relatively normal static perimetry in the central visual field up to 30\u00ba \neccentricity but with some upper right quadrant loss (see Milner et al., 1991). Neuroimaging studies of \npatient DF\u2019s brain have been reported in James et al. (2003) and Steeves et al. (2004; 2006). An \nextensive description of DF\u2019s behavioural and neural response to face images is found in Steeves et al \n(2006). In brief, however, she is unable to recognize face identity, gender or emotional expression but \nshe can generally categorize faces and discriminate faces from objects that she can not recognize. \nPatient DF also shows robust activation for face images within the \u201cFFA\u201d, which is normal in terms of \namplitude and spatial extent, bilaterally, with a block design face\/scene localizer but she does not show \nface sensitive responses in the inferior occipital cortex (i.e. no \u201cOFA\u201d).  \nPatient PS is a female, 56 years of age at the time of testing, whose neuropsychological profile \nand brain damage has been described in detail previously (Rossion et al., 2003; Caldara et al., 2005; \nSchiltz et al., 2006; Sorger et al., 2007). Her presenting neurological symptom is prosopagnosia and \nunlike patient DF, she does not present object recognition difficulties. Patient PS has normal visual \nfields, with the exception of a small left paracentral scotoma. The data collected on PS have been \nrecently reported as a subset of a larger study (Dricot et al., 2008) that tested identity adaptation to \nfaces with an independent localizer. This independent localizer was unavailable for patient DF due to \nlimited scanning time and as a result the present data include a re-analysis of the Dricot et al. (2008) \ndata so that the analysis for patient DF and PS is exactly the same.  \nIn addition to the two patients, four neurologically intact participants (age: 25-35 years, 2 \nfemale) as well as one age-matched control participant (S5, 56 years of age, female) were tested. While \nit has been shown that the profile of activation in the right middle fusiform gyrus remains stable across \n 7 \ndecades (Brodtmann et al., 2003) and therefore perhaps not necessary to ensure exact age-matching of \nparticipants, we also include the data from the age-matched control.  \nThe patients and the control subjects gave informed written consent prior to the fMRI \nexperiments. The study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics \nCommittees of the Department of Medicine at the University of Louvain and the York University \nOffice of Research Ethics. Control subjects and PS were strongly right-handed according to the \nEdinburgh Inventory (Oldfield, 1971) and patient DF is also right handed.  \nStimuli and procedures  \nParticipants viewed three runs of 80 pairs of stimuli during fMRI recordings. The stimuli were \npictures of faces and butterflies as shown in Figure 1. Thirty-two face and 32 butterfly images were \nused in an event-related design. There were four conditions of interest: two different face identities, \ntwo identical face identities, two different butterflies, two identical butterflies in each pair. Finally, a \nfifth condition of a butterfly followed by a face image (or the opposite order for half of the trials) was \nused and participants were asked to respond to these face-object pair trials by pressing a response key. \nThis task was well suited to the goals of the experiment because it ensured that the participants were \nattending to the stimuli, and it was a task that both patients could perform well. [DF has been shown \npreviously to be able to categorize faces even though she cannot recognize them (Steeves et al., 2006).] \nFurther, this task ensured that the factors of interest of the study (category effect: faces vs. butterflies; \nadaptation effect: same vs. different identities) would not be contaminated by any decisional and\/or \nmotor processes since the behavioural task was completely orthogonal to the test factors in the study, \nand any difference between patients and the controls could not be attributed to general processing \ndifficulties on the trials of interest. \nThere were 16 trials per condition per run and the order of conditions was fully randomized \nwithin a run. Within a trial, the first stimulus of a pair was presented for 1000 ms followed by a blank \n 8 \nscreen for 500 ms and thereafter by the second stimulus of the pair, which was also presented for 1000 \nms (Figure 1). The pairs were separated by a fixation cross with a duration of 5000, 6250 or 7500 ms \n(4-6 functional volumes), and these interstimulus interval (ISI) durations were also fully randomized. \nThis timing ensured that the onset of distinct events was separated by at least 6-8 functional volumes \n(7500-10000 ms). Randomization of trial order and of ISI duration further reduced any potential top-\ndown effects of anticipation of the stimuli. \nAll images (pictures of faces and butterflies) were presented in the central visual field in colour \nand subtended approximately 4\u00b0 of visual angle. Stimuli were spatially jittered by 40 pixels in X (5%) \nand 40 pixels in Y (7%) dimensions. The pairs were displayed in random order with a PC using E-\nprime 1.1 (PST Inc.) and projected onto a screen located above the head of the subject and viewed \nthrough an angled mirror. \n__________________________ \nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n__________________________ \n \nImaging experiments \nMR images of brain activity were acquired on all participants using a 3T head scanner (Siemens \nAllegra, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany), with repeated single-shot echo-planar imaging: echo time \n(TE) = 50 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90\u00b0, matrix size = 64 x 64, field of view (FOV) = 224 x 224 mm\u00b2, slice \norder descending and interleaved. Scan parameters were: repetition time (TR) = 1250 ms, 21 slices, \nslice thickness = 3.5 mm, no gap between slices, run time length = 11 min 46, sec 250 ms. A three-\ndimensional (3D) T1-weighted data set encompassing the whole brain was acquired for each subject to \nprovide detailed anatomy (1 mm3) using a \"Modified Driven Equilibrium Fourier Transform\u201d \n 9 \n(MDEFT) sequence (scan parameters: TR = 7.92 ms, TE = 2.4 ms, FA =15\u00b0, matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256, \nFOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm2, 176 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, no gap, total scan time = 13 min and 43 s). \nData analysis of the imaging experiments \nThe fMRI signal in the different conditions was compared using BrainVoyager QX (Version \n1.4, Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) applying a General Linear Model analysis. Prior to \nanalysis, the functional data sets were subjected to a series of preprocessing operations. This \npreprocessing consisted of linear trend removal to exclude scanner-related signal drift, temporal high-\npass filtering in order to remove temporal frequencies lower than 3 cycles per run, and a correction for \nsmall interscan head movements using a rigid body algorithm rotating and translating each functional \nvolume in 3D space (Friston et al., 1995). In addition to preprocessing, the data from the event-related \nexperiment were also corrected for the difference between the scan times of the slices. Data were not \nsmoothed in the spatial domain but were filtered in the temporal domain (FWHM = 2.8 cycles per \nsecond). In order to compare activated brain regions across subjects, all anatomical images and \nfunctional volumes were spatially normalized (Talairach-transformation; Talairach & Tournoux, 1988). \nComputed statistical maps were overlaid on the 3D T1-weighted scans to determine Talairach \ncoordinates for all relevant activation clusters. Subsequently, the functional data were analyzed using \nmultiple regression models consisting of predictors, which corresponded to the particular experimental \nconditions of the experiment. The predictor time courses used were computed on the basis of a general \nlinear model (GLM) of the relationship between neural activity and hemodynamic response, assuming \na square wave neural response during phases of visual stimulation (Boynton et. al., 1996). For our two \npatients and the control subjects, we computed a main effect to localize the face-preferential areas \n(faces vs butterflies), and tested the interaction and simple adaptation effects for each stimulus \ncondition in these areas. Statistical thresholds were chosen with [q(False Discovery Rate) < 0.01] with \na minimum of 50 voxel clustering.  \n 10 \nRESULTS \nBehavioural data during fMRI \nAll participants performed the behavioural task of indicating across-category trials at ceiling (control \nmeans: 95%+\/-0.03%), PS (96%) and DF (100% correct detection but one false alarm). Patients \nshowed comparable response latencies to each other and to controls (controls: 595+\/-128 ms; PS: 576 \nms; DF: 747 ms) with t = -0.100, p = 0.463 for PS and t = 1.084, p = 0.17 for DF [modified t-test \n(Crawford and Garthwaite, 2002)]. \nNeuroimaging results \nWhole brain analysis \nA. Main effect of category: faces vs. objects \nThe comparison of face and butterfly images, independent of adaptation effects, led to \nsignificant activation in several high-level visual areas for the control participants as well as for both \npatients (Figure 2). Our group of normal controls (including the age-matched control) showed \nsignificant activation at [p(Bonferroni-corrected) < 0.001] in the right and left \u2018FFA\u2019 (mean Talairach \ncoordinates, right \u2018FFA\u2019: 39, -45, -19; 559 voxels and left \u2018FFA\u2019: -39, -43, -19; 777 voxels), and [at \nq(FDR) < 0.001] in the right \u2018pSTS\u2019 (mean Talairach coordinates, 49, -44, 12; 77 voxels) and in the \nright and left \u2018OFA\u2019 (mean Talairach coordinates, right \u2018OFA\u2019: 40, -69, -13; 188 voxels and left \n\u2018OFA\u2019: -40, -66, -16; 101 voxels).  \nConsistent with previous observations, there was significant activation [at q(FDR) < 0.001] for \nfaces in the \u2018FFA\u2019 and \u2018pSTS\u2019 of the right hemisphere for both patient PS and DF (Talairach \ncoordinates, Patient PS: \u2018FFA\u2019: 37, -54, -18; 591 voxels and \u2018pSTS\u2019: 41, -49, 14; 37 voxels  and Patient \nDF: \u2018FFA\u2019: 44, -47, -21; 178 voxels and \u2018pSTS\u2019: 48, -47, -1; 525 voxels) (Figure 2). These activations \nwere within the normal range for size and anatomical location as previously reported (PS: Rossion et \nal., 2003; Sorger et al., 2007; DF: Steeves et al., 2006). Also consistent with previous work, there was \n 11 \nsignificant activation in the left \u2018FFA\u2019 for patient DF (Talairach coordinates: -36, -48, -19; 434 voxels) \nand in the left \u2018OFA\u2019 for patient PS [but at p(uncorrected)<0.045, -31, -81, -17; 30 voxels]. In \nsummary, the missing components of the network of face preferential activation in both patients were \nareas that would have been located in structurally damaged tissue (Figure 2). The common lesion site \nin the two patients is the right hemisphere \u2018OFA\u2019. \n__________________________ \nINSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n__________________________ \n \nROI-based analysis \nB. Adaptation effects for faces \nIn each of the areas showing preferential activation for faces, we tested for interactions between \nadaptation and category, as well as separately for effects of adaptation for each of the image categories \n(faces and butterflies). Adaptation indices were computed using the beta weights of the general linear \nmodel (GLM) analysis [Faces Index = (different faces versus same faces)\/(different faces+same \nfaces)]. Consistent with previous findings (Schiltz et al., 2006; Dricot et al., 2008), PS did not show \nany evidence of release from adaptation to face identity in the right \u2018FFA\u2019 (t = 1.499; p = 0.1339; \nFigure 3), unlike normal participants (t = 3.732; p < 0.0002; Figure 3). Hence, her middle fusiform \ngyrus responds preferentially to a picture of a face, but does not distinguish between different face \nidentities. Strikingly, this absence of release from adaptation to face identity was also observed for the \nfirst time in the right \u2018FFA\u2019 of patient DF (Figure 3) for which there was, in fact, a trend toward a \npattern of activation opposite that which was expected (slightly higher signal for pairs of identical faces \nthan different faces) (t =-1.698, p = 0.09). Thus, the right \u2018FFAs\u2019 of the two acquired prosopagnosia \npatients do not show release from adaptation to identity, in contrast to the healthy control participants. \n 12 \nRelease from adaptation to identity was observed, however, in other face-preferential areas of \nthe control participants: (right \u2018OFA\u2019: t = 2.449, p < 0.0143 and left \u2018FFA\u2019: t = 2.414, p < 0.0158) but \nnot in the left \u2018OFA\u2019: (t = 0.594, p = 0.5527) and right pSTS (t = 0.644, p = 0.5194). In contrast, none \nof these regions that were intact in either patient showed such effects. There was no release from \nadaptation to face identity for patient PS in the left \u2018OFA\u2019 (t = 0.242, p = 0.8089) or right \u2018pSTS\u2019 (t = \n0.043, p = 0.9656) nor for patient DF in the left \u2018FFA\u2019 (t = -0.967, p = 0.3339) or the right \u2018pSTS\u2019 (t = -\n1.442, p = 0.1494) (Supplementary figure 1). \nWhen comparing patient indices directly to those of controls, there was a significant difference \nin the \u2018FFA\u2019 for patient DF (t=-5.07, p=0.004) and for patient PS (t=-2.48, p=0.034).  \n__________________________ \nINSERT FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE \n__________________________ \n \nC. Adaptation effects for objects \nThis absence of release from adaptation to identity, in particular in the right \u2018FFA\u2019 cannot be \nattributed to a lower signal overall for the patients, because this area responds robustly to faces in both \npatients (Figure 3). Moreover, this area (right FFA) shows an identity adaptation effect when \ncontrasting different and identical pictures of butterflies in not only our control participants (t = 5.281, \np<0.00001; Figure 3), but also in patient PS (t = 4.725, p < 0.00001; Figure 3; see also Dricot et al., \n2008). There was no such effect for patient DF (t = -0.882, p = 0.3778; Figure 3).  \nRelease from adaptation to identity for butterflies was observed in other face-preferential areas \nof the normal participants including the right \u2018OFA\u2019 (t = 3.040, p < 0.0024), left \u2018OFA\u2019( t = 3.416, p < \n0.0006) and left \u2018FFA\u2019 (t = 5.499, p < 0.00001) but not the right pSTS (t = 0.376, p = 0.7063). For \npatient PS, release from adaptation was found in the pSTS (t = 2.787, p < 0.0053) but not in the left \n 13 \n\u2018OFA\u2019 (t = -0.181, p = 0.8569) and there was no release from adaptation at all for patient DF in any of \nthe regions of interest responding preferentially to faces (left \u2018FFA\u2019: t = 1.331, p = 0.1833; right \n\u2018pSTS\u2019: t = -2.075, p = 0.0381) (Supplementary figure 1). \nWhen comparing patient indices directly to those of controls, there was a significant difference \nin the \u2018FFA\u2019 for patient DF (t=-6.26, p=0.002) and but not for patient PS (t=-0.387, p=0.36). \nD. Interaction between adaptation and category \nIn summary, identity adaptation effects for both faces and objects were observed in normal \nparticipants in the right \u2018FFA\u2019 and in other face preferential areas (Table 1). For patient PS, identity \nadaptation effects were only observed for objects, while for patient DF there were no adaptation effects \nfor objects or faces. When testing the interaction between category and adaptation, normal participants \nshowed equally large identity adaptation in the \u2018FFA\u2019 for faces and objects (interaction: t = -1.091, p = \n0.2755), while PS showed a larger effect for objects (t = -2.293, p < 0.0219) than for faces in the right \n\u2018FFA\u2019, and DF did not show identity adaptation for either image category in any of these areas (t = -\n0.573, p = 5665). \n__________________________ \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n__________________________ \n \nE. Whole brain conjunction analysis \nTo strengthen our results, a whole brain analysis was performed on the control participants with \nthe conjunction of three contrasts: [((Different Faces + Same Faces) versus (Different Butterflies + \nSame Butterflies)) & (Different Faces \u2013 Same Faces) & (Different Butterflies \u2013 Same Butterflies)]. \nThis was done using a fixed effects analysis with our five subjects, for which we found only one \nsignificant cluster, corresponding to the Talairach coordinates of the \u2018FFA\u2019 (Figure 4): 37, -43, -22; 31 \n 14 \nvoxels, q(FDR) < 0.05. The same analysis did not reveal any activation for either patient, which is \nconsistent with their absence of adaptation effects for faces in the faces\u2019 ROI analyses. In addition, we \nperformed a whole brain analysis searching for identity adaptation effects for pictures of faces and \nbutterflies in PS and DF\u2019s brain. Consistent with our most recent findings (Dricot et al., 2008), we \nfound a significant release from face and object identity adaptation for PS in an area adjacent to her \nright inferior occipital lesion, corresponding to the ventral part of the lateral occipital complex (vLOC, \nsee Dricot et al., 2008) [Talairach coordinates: 50, -64, -10; 506 voxels at p(uncorrected) < 0.045, t = \n3.705, p < 0.0002 for face adaptation and t = 3.206, p < 0.0014 for object adaptation without an \ninteraction between category and adaptation (t = 0.344, p = 0.7306); Figure 5].  \nThis cluster is not specific to faces and responds even more to objects than to faces [contrast \n([Different Butterflies + Same Butterflies] versus [Different Faces + Same Faces]), t = 2.758, p < \n0.0059]. This indicates that PS recruits an area that does not respond preferentially to faces, the vLOC, \nto differentiate face identities. Importantly, this effect is not specific to patient PS-- when the vLOC is \nlocalized independently in normal observers, this region also shows a larger response to different \nexemplars than same exemplars, irrespective of the category. This has been observed in several studies \nwith normal observers (Avidan et al., 2002; Grill-Spector et al.,1999; Sayres and Grill-Spector, 2006), \nas well as for both faces and objects in individual normal subjects tested with the paradigm used in the \npresent study, in which the vLOC was localized independently (Dricot et al., 2008). Hence, the \nsensitivity to different individual faces in the vLOC of the patient PS appears to reflect a residual rather \nthan a compensatory mode of processing the individual face. \nIn contrast, there was no evidence for any identity adaptation effects in patient DF\u2019s brain for \nfaces or butterflies, consistent with her general visual form agnosia. \n__________________________ \nINSERT FIGURES 4 & 5 ABOUT HERE \n 15 \n__________________________ \n \nDISCUSSION \nWithin the network of occipitotemporal areas that respond preferentially to faces, our two acquired \nprosopagnosia patients present a common lesion site encompassing the right \u2018OFA\u2019. Each of the other \ncomponents of the network was intact either in one of the patients (left \u2018OFA\u2019 for PS; left \u2018FFA\u2019 for DF), \nor in both patients\u2019 brain (right pSTS and \u2018FFA\u2019). The preferential activation for faces in the two patients \nwas in the normal range in terms of amplitude and spatial extent, even though the large variability in \npatterns of activation in the healthy control participants may mask minor abnormalities at this level. That \nis, one can never rule out the possibility that without the lesions to other face-sensitive regions (e.g., the \nright \u2018OFA\u2019), the level of activation in response to faces in the other components of the network might \nhave been higher in these patients. Nevertheless, these findings strongly support the notion that, in \naddition to the right middle fusiform gyrus (Barton et al., 2002), a critical site implicated in prosopagnosia \nis located in the inferior occipital cortex in the right hemisphere, in the vicinity of the right \u2018OFA\u2019 \n(Bouvier & Engel, 2006). Moreover, these data indicate that the \u2018OFA\u2019, whether it is located in the right \nor left hemisphere, does not constitute a stage of processing that necessarily has to precede and send input \nto the rest of the face cortical network in order for those higher areas to be activated. This observation \ncasts doubts on a hierarchical view of face processing, advocated in several papers (Haxby et al., 2000; \nIshai, 2008; see also Jiang et al., 2006; Pitcher et al., 2008). Rather, these data support the view that there \nmust be direct connections from early visual areas that do not show preferential sensitivity to faces, to the \nmiddle fusiform gyrus and possibly the pSTS, leading to face preferential responses in those areas \n(Rossion, 2008). \nThis hypothesis is not novel, but is reinforced by the present data and by previous observations \nmade by two groups of independent researchers with these patients. The key observation of the present \n 16 \nstudy, however, is the lack of release from adaptation to face identity in the \u2018FFA\u2019 of both patients DF \nand PS. This is consistent with previous findings observed in patient PS (Schiltz et al., 2006; Dricot et \nal., 2008). Behaviorally, both patients present strong impairments at individualizing faces, and they do \nnot show the release from adaptation to face identity that is observed in the healthy control participants \nboth in the present experiment and in numerous other studies (e.g. Gauthier et al., 2000; Grill-Spector \n& Malach, 2001). Taken together, this strengthens the notion that the right \u2018OFA\u2019 \u2013 the two patients\u2019 \ncommon missing region within the cortical face network - is an integral component of the network for \nprocessing face identity (Gauthier et al., 2000), and is necessary for this function. Its role within this \nnetwork may not be to precede the preferential activation for faces at the level of the FFA but rather its \nrole in face identity processing, in particular in the right hemisphere, may be to contribute to the \nrefinement of the face representation, following the initial categorization of a face in the \u201chigher-order\u201d \nright \u2018FFA\u2019 (Rossion, 2008). This reverse hierarchical view (Hochstein and Ahissar, 2002) of face \nperception is consistent with the presence of massive cortical bi-directional connections (Felleman & \nVan Essen, 1991) and the hypothesis of reentrant phasic signaling between areas of visual cortex \n(Edelman, 1978; 1993). In a similar vein, a number of authors have suggested that higher level \nperceptual computations and representations that require high resolution details, fine geometry and \nspatial precision may involve lower visual areas through feedback connections (Mumford, 1992; \nBullier et al., 2001; Lee et al., 1998; Galuske et al., 2002). For the recognition of face identity, \nrefinement in the initial coarse face representation would require the high resolution details both at the \nlevel of the face features and of its configuration (Sergent, 1986).  \nDespite presenting a common lesion in the right inferior occipital cortex that is most likely \ncritical in causing their face processing impairment (Bouvier & Engel, 2006), patients PS and DF do \nnot present the same neuropsychological profile. While patient DF has a visual form agnosia, and is \nunable to recognize common objects (Milner et al., 1991), patient PS does not present any difficulty in \n 17 \nrecognizing objects, whether they have to be identified or discriminated at the basic-level or at more \nfine-grained categorization levels (Rossion et al., 2003; Schiltz et al., 2006). Consistent with these \nbehavioural differences, patient DF has bilateral damage to the lateral occipital area (LO, James et al., \n2003), while this region is both structurally and functionally intact for patient PS (bilateral dorsal LO \nand right ventral LO, Sorger et al., 2007). Moreover, patient PS\u2019 area LO shows a larger response to \nnormal shapes compared to scrambled shapes (Sorger et al., 2007), and it also shows release from \nadaptation to the repetition of the same object shape (Dricot et al., 2008; the present study).  \nIn addition, we note that while patient PS showed a significant release from adaptation in the \nright \u2018FFA\u2019 to object shapes, patient DF did not. This is an interesting observation because patient DF \nis able to discriminate some non-face stimuli, particularly natural objects such as fruits and vegetables \nbased on surface properties such as colour (Humphrey, Goodale, Jakobsen & Servos, 1994), yet her \nright \u2018FFA\u2019 did not show release from adaptation in this condition. This suggests that the positive \nadaptation effect observed for patient PS in the \u2018FFA\u2019 for objects (Dricot et al., 2008) may not be \nattributable to a simple release from adaptation driven by colour alone.  \nFurther to these differences in object recognition, the two patients are not equally strongly \nimpaired with respect to face processing. Patient DF is severely impaired in individual face \ndiscrimination, scoring generally at chance levels (Steeves et al., 2006). Patient PS, however, is \nimpaired relative to controls but nonetheless performs well above chance levels in individual face \ndiscrimination tasks (Rossion et al., 2003; Schiltz et al., 2006). Previous studies have shown that \npatient PS relies on suboptimal cues to discriminate and recognize individual faces (e.g. the mouth and \nlower external contour; Caldara et al., 2005), and appears to analyze each facial feature consecutively, \nin detail, rather than resorting to an efficient holistic processing of the individual face, as do normal \nobservers (Orban de Xivry et al., 2008). The imaging data for patient PS collected previously (Dricot et \nal., 2008) and that in the present study suggest that this sub-efficient, analytical mode of processing the \n 18 \nindividual face does not rely on areas responding preferentially to faces, but may involve more general \nprocesses in the ventral part of the lateral occipital complex. \nAnother original aspect of the present experiment lies in the fact that while patient DF\u2019s face-\npreferential regions in the middle fusiform gyrus (\u2018FFA\u2019) were reported previously in a block design \nface localizer experiment (Steeves et al., 2006), this is the first time that this face selective-activation is \nreported in an ER design, limiting the putative role of top-down influences on the activation of the \n\u2018FFA\u2019. This is an important observation, since it is known that the \u2018FFA\u2019 can be modulated and \nactivated through top-down processes, for instance through visual imagery of faces (O\u2019Craven & \nKanwisher, 2001) or recognizing the voices of familiar people (von Kriegstein et al., 2005). In the kind \nof paradigm used here, the participant does not know in advance which stimulus category will be \npresented (pair of faces or objects) and thus anticipatory top-down processes cannot account for the \ndifferential activity observed in these areas. A further novel aspect of the present study is that we used \na different category for the contrast compared to the previous study with patient DF (Steeves et al., \n2006). Here we define these areas by contrasting faces with objects while the previous study contrasted \nfaces with scenes. \nIn summary, the present study compared functional brain activation in two unique brain-\ndamaged patients who both suffer from acquired prosopagnosia. The findings strengthen the critical \nrole of the right inferior occipital cortex, in the vicinity of the right \u2018occipital face area\u2019, in acquired \nprosopagnosia (Bouvier & Engel, 2006; Sorger et al., 2007). Damage to this region does not prevent \noverall face sensitivity within the right middle fusiform gyrus (\u2018FFA\u2019), thus arguing against a strict \nhierarchical view of face processing in the human brain. However, right \u2018OFA\u2019 damage does appear to \nprevent the differential sensitivity of the \u2018FFA\u2019 to different face identity, suggesting a reentrant role of \nthe right \u2018OFA\u2019 in extracting fine-grained individual representations of faces in the normal brain. \nAcknowledgements \n 19 \nThis study was supported by grants from the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research \n(FNRS) and a grant ARC 07\/12-007 to BR (Mandat d\u2019Impulsion Scientifique), the Natural Sciences \nand Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to JS and the Medical Research Council \n(MRC) # G0401090 to AM.
