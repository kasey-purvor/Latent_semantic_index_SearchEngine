Lett., 33, L03301,\ndoi:10.1029\/2005GL025005.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Topographic measurements are critical to a wide\nrange of scientific and hazard monitoring applications. In\nmany cases, changes in topography are relatively small and\noccur sufficiently slowly that accurate measurements can be\ncarried out using conventional or spaceborne surveying\nmethods. In other cases (e.g., large landslips, lava flows\nor dome growth at volcanoes) changes can be rapid,\ncreating conditions under which only remote sensing can\nbe employed safely. In these instances suitable techniques\nsuch as ground-based laser ranging [Hunter et al., 2003],\nairborne lidar [Mazzarini et al., 2005] and photogrammetry\n[Baldi et al., 2005] are reliant on good visibility (e.g., no\nobscuration by cloud, fog or condensing volcanic gases).\nSuch cases require the use of radar techniques (e.g., radar\ninterferometry [Lu et al., 2003]), however the timely appli-\ncation of traditional radar methods can be restricted by\naircraft availability or the frequency of satellite repeat\npasses. Furthermore, radar interferometry fails on rapidly\nevolving surfaces such as active lava domes due to the\ndecorrelation of returns [Wadge et al., 1999]. Consequently,\nexisting radar systems are not usually suitable for reliable\nand timely hazard assessment on volcanoes.\n[3] The AVTIS (All-weather Volcano Topography Imag-\ning Sensor) radar was designed to fulfill this requirement by\nproviding a compact, portable unit that can easily be\ndeployed in the field [Wadge et al., 2006a, 2006b]. This\nis achieved by operating in the millimetre wave band of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. For the same size of antenna,\nmm-waves provide inherently higher angular resolution\nthan can be achieved with the longer wavelengths of\ntraditional microwave radar while retaining the advantage\nof low attenuation through cloud. The instrument can\ntherefore produce high spatial resolution measurements\ncontinuously through conditions of no visibility. Other high\nperformance mm-wave radars exist but they tend to have\nbeen optimised for very different applications (e.g., runway\ndebris detection [Beasley et al., 2004]) and are not well\nsuited for topographic surveying. For environments prone to\nconditions of poor visibility AVTIS represents a valuable\nadvance in our long-range measurement capability.\n[4] The results of an initial AVTIS deployment on\nMontserrat [Wadge et al., 2006a, 2006b] illustrated the\npotential of the instrument for topographic monitoring.\nSubsequent significant advances in hardware and data\nprocessing have improved the signal to noise ratio by\n27 dB extending our maximum detection range from 3.8 km\nto \u00017 km with a range resolution of \u00011 m. Consequently,\nlocalised topographic changes can now be easily detected.\nHere we present data from Arenal volcano, Costa Rica,\nwhich demonstrate the usefulness of AVTIS as a tool for\nremotely monitoring active lava flows.\n[5] This application is driven by a requirement to\nimprove our ability to measure the rate at which lava is\nerupted from volcanoes; a critical parameter that is often\nvery difficult to measure directly due to factors such as\nhazardous conditions and problems of access. This is the\ncase at Arenal, where effusion rate estimates have been\ncarried out previously using low repeat-frequency remote\ntopographic measurements [Wadge, 1983; Wadge et al.,\n2006a, 2006b]. Under conditions where close approach is\npossible and safe, then methods of estimating effusion rate\nsuch as measuring very low frequency electromagnetic\nfields [Kauahikaua et al., 1996] can be used. Radiant heat\nflux measurements can also be used as a mass flux rate\nproxy [e.g., Calvari et al., 2005]. Our AVTIS measure-\nments were carried out in April and May 2005, when\nsmall, low-effusion rate basaltic andesite lava flows were\ndescending from the summit vents.\n2. Millimetre Wave Topographic Imaging\n[6] The AVTIS instrument is a portable, tripod-mounted,\n94 GHz FMCW mm-wave radar unit designed for ground-\nbased deployment around active volcanoes. The radar con-\nsists of a single transmit\/receive antenna and radar head (on\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 33, L03301, doi:10.1029\/2005GL025005, 2006\n1School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews, Fife,\nUK.\n2Environmental Systems Science Centre, University of Reading,\nReading, UK.\n3Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/06\/2005GL025005$05.00\nL03301 1 of 4\na pan and tilt gimbal), a power supply unit, batteries and a\nlaptop. For technical details, see Macfarlane and Robertson\n[2004, 2005].\n[7] An angular raster scan of the radar across a scene\ngives a volume data set of backscattered power against\nrange for the azimuth and elevation values covered. In\norder to extract topographic information (i.e., the appro-\npriate range values), a \u2018surface indicator\u2019 criterion has to\nbe applied for each line of sight. In many conventional\nradar applications, the aim is to identify a reflective point-\nlike (sub-beamwidth) target at a specific range against a\nbackground level of clutter. The target range is indicated\nby the range bin containing return power above a certain\nthreshold [Skolnik, 1990]. However, when trying to mea-\nsure the range to beam-filling natural topography, the\nclutter itself becomes the target. The radar return signal\nis produced by an ensemble of individual point scatterers\nof similar reflectivity (such as angular rocks) contained\nwithin the extended radar footprint and is typically spread\nin range. Using a simple power threshold criterion on the\nraw power spectra results in a high degree of noise within\nthe surface data. Consequently, we have introduced a\nseries of data processing steps to improve surface deter-\nmination when imaging natural topography. These are: (i)\npower versus range normalisation, (ii) low pass filtering,\n(iii) maximum power detection, and finally, (iv) power\nthresholding.\n[8] The initial normalisation corrects the data for the\n(1\/range)2 fall-off in reflected power associated with\nbeam-filling targets [Skolnik, 1990]. The normalised data\nare then filtered with a low pass 50-bin two-way (phase\ninvariant) filter. This significantly reduces the noise from\npoint scatterers but leaves the range to the maximum\nsignal return unaltered, producing a range spectrum that\nrepresents the average distance to the illuminated sur-\nface. Range is then indicated by the bin of maximum\npower return in the filtered spectrum (step iii). Finally,\nfalse returns (e.g., lines of sight to clear air) are detected\nand removed by comparison with a power threshold\nbased on a Gaussian fit to the overall distribution of\nmaximum power return from the entire raster data set. For\nthe data presented here, a threshold value of 2.0 sigma was\nused.\n[9] The resultant data points have polar co-ordinates of\nazimuth, elevation and range. With knowledge of the radar\nposition and pointing direction, these are converted into\nCartesian co-ordinates and a digital elevation model (DEM)\ncan then be constructed by interpolating surface height over\nan x-y grid of selected resolution.\n3. Measurements at Arenal\n[10] During late April to early May 2005, two lava flows\nwere observed erupting from vents at the summit of the\nvolcano (\u00011700 m a.s.l., Figure 1). One flow descended the\nsteep slopes of the upper cone to the southwest and largely\ndisintegrated into rockfalls on the upper slopes. Another\nmoved eastward to the col separating the old and new cones\nbefore turning southward. Our measurements of this second\nflow from two observing sites A and B (Figure 1), about\n3 km to the south and south-southwest respectively, are\npresented here (Table 1). On 23 April, the flow was\nvisible, although atmospheric haze and intermittent cloud\nobscured details and would have prevented the use of\nother remote sensing methods such a photogrammetry or\nlaser scanning. On 27 April, observations were carried out\nin the evening, with the majority of the data collected\nduring darkness. The restricted glow from rock-fall activ-\nity on the upper slopes of the volcano indicated that cloud\nalso covered the summit and lava flow regions. The final\n1 May acquisition provided good visibility of the flow\nand allowed the photograph shown in Figure 1 to be\ntaken.\n[11] At location A (occupied on 27 April and 1 May),\nan existing permanent instrument mounting at the Arenal\nFigure 1.

The two active lava\nflows of April\/May 2005 are shown in black. The AVTIS\nradar imaged the southern lava flow between cones C and D\nfrom sites A and B. The outline rectangle represents the area\naround this flow shown in detail in Figure 2. The inset\nphotograph shows the view of the flow from A on 1 May,\nduring a period of exceptional visibility.

At location\nB (occupied on 23 May), AVTIS was mounted on a\nsurveying tripod whose position was determined by\ndGPS. At each site, the entire view of the volcano was\nimaged at a coarse angular increment of 0.25\u0001 with an\nadditional scan of the summit (including the lava flow) at\na finer increment of 0.05\u0001.\n[12] Whilst the threaded instrument mount at A gave a\nfixed spatial position for the radar, it did not provide perfect\nangular re-alignment between the two days. Alignment by\nobservation of a control point corner cube was also pre-\nvented by the local topography and close proximity of trees\nat this site. Hence, to improve the data registration, an area\nof no topographic change common to both DEMs was\nselected and a local search of azimuth-elevation space was\ncarried out to find the angular offsets that minimised the\nrms differences between the two surfaces. A similar\nprocedure was carried out to align data from site B; an\ninitial radar orientation determined by imaging corner cube\ncontrol points co-ordinated by dGPS [Wadge et al., 2006a,\n2006b] was then improved by minimising surface differ-\nences. Finally, in order to accommodate minor remaining\nuncertainties in the relative radar imaging orientations\nbetween sites A and B, an iterative closest point refine-\nment (a standard technique for merging laser scanner data)\nwas carried out. This refinement was responsible for\nadjusting point co-ordinates by only \u00012 m. After regis-\ntration the data sets were interpolated to a common\nhorizontal grid (of spacing 2.5 m) for direct comparison.\n[13] The AVTIS-derived DEM of the southern side of\nArenal acquired on 1 May is shown in Figure 2 as projected\nshaded relief. Although the topographic representation\nappears to be reasonable, some surface noise is apparent.\nDifferencing the registered DEMs for 23 April, 27 April and\n1 May reveals the vertical changes over the intervening\nperiods. Between 23 April and 1 May, an area of positive\nheight change, with an average value of \u000110 m and\nmaximum values of \u000120 m, was measured at the distal\nend of the lava flow (Figure 2, top right inset, and Figure 3).\nThis area corresponds to an advance of \u0001200 m for the flow\nover the eight days.\n4. Discussion\n[14] Although the differenced topography in Figure 2\nclearly shows the advancing flow, there are other areas of\napparent topographic change of \u00b15 m which are not corre-\nlated with real topographic variation. This relatively high\nfrequency \u2018noise\u2019 is believed to be a remnant effect of\nstrong, discrete point scatterers which have not been com-\npletely removed by the low-pass filtering. For a target slope\nof \u000130\u0001, at range of 3000 m and viewed from an elevation\nangle of \u000116\u0001, an apparent height error of \u00b17 m would be\ngiven if the return signal was dominated by a point scatterer\nlocated either at the top or the bottom of the main lobe. If\nthe beam was in identical orientations during repeat\nobservations, then this effect would not be detected as a\ntopographic difference during analysis. However, with the\ninstrument removed between observations, precise realign-\nment was not possible and therefore strong permanent\nscatterers may be represented differently within the data\nsets.\n[15] Analogous to laser scanner data, each topographic\npoint determined by AVTIS is accompanied by a power\nvalue describing the strength of the returned signal. Lava\nflows are renowned for being highly reflective surfaces for\nmicrowave radars [Plaut et al., 2004] due to their local\nsurface roughness, and the lava flows of Arenal are typically\nblocky [Borgia et al., 1983], so should provide strong edge,\npoint and facet reflectors. This is the case for the lava flow\nimaged here (Figure 2, top left inset), which is significantly\nmore reflective than the surrounding surfaces which were\ngenerally dominated by ash and small clasts.\n[16] The surface-to-surface topographic changes detected\nin the area of the lava flow can be converted to volumetric\nflux rates by dividing by the appropriate time intervals. The\nrate between 23 and 27 April is 0.29 \u00b1 0.15 m3s\u00021, between\n27 April and 1 May is 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 m3s\u00021 and overall,\nbetween 23 April and 1 May is 0.23 \u00b1 0.1 m3s\u00021 (or 0.20 \u00b1\n0.08 m3s\u00021, when converted to dense rock equivalent (\u0003\n0.86)). The uncertainties were calculated from the area of no\ntopographic change used in the registration process. The\nFigure 2. The main image is of shaded topography on the\nsouth side of Arenal Volcano measured by AVTIS from site\nA on 1 May 2005. The active lava flow is outlined in black.\nThe left inset shows how the reflectivity of the surface\n(returned radar power, in dB, relative to the maximum\nreturn in the image) discriminates well between lava (red)\nand ash (blue). The right inset shows the increase in\nthickness of the lava flow in metres between 23 April and 1\nMay 2005. The white crosses mark the start and end points\nof the profile cut shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3.

Factors\nsuch as channel drainage of a flow that is not being actively\nfed at the time [Borgia et al., 1984] cannot be discounted.\n[17] The observed rates on Arenal during April and May\n2005 are low, both in terms of Arenal\u2019s long-term behaviour\nsince 1968 [Wadge et al., 2006a, 2006b] and in comparison\nto many other lava flow eruptions at other volcanoes, where\neffusion rates of 0.1\u201310 m3s\u00021 are the norm.\n[18] Our measurements of Arenal\u2019s 2005 activity were\nmade under relatively favourable viewing conditions (i.e., a\nlarge fraction of volume change was accounted for by\napparent surface motion along the radar line of sight). The\nchanges were also detected from different locations with\nless favourable (more oblique) observation angles but the\ncalculations associated with these measurements are conse-\nquently prone to larger errors. A full discussion of this issue\nis left for future work, nevertheless we have demonstrated\nthe ability of mm-wave radar imaging to measure topo-\ngraphic changes associated with low effusion rate lava\nflows, from different viewing points and during periods of\nlow or no visibility.\n[19] Acknowledgments.
