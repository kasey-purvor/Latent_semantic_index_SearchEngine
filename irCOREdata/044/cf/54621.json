Specifically,\nstate-variable concepts are employed and new analysis techniques\nare developed to establish operating mode boundaries with which\nto describe the internal behaviour of a dual-output resonant\nconverter topology. The designer is guided through the most\nimportant criteria for realising a satisfactory converter, and the\nimpact of parameter choices on performance is explored.\nPredictions from the resulting models are compared with those\nobtained from SPICE simulations and measurements from a\nprototype power supply under closed loop control.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWith the increased power capability, improved control and\nreduced cost of power semiconductor devices, designers of\nelectronic equipment, computers and electronic\ninstrumentation are increasingly demanding higher energy and\nmore efficient power supplies. Moreover, the trend towards\nminiaturisation of electronic systems, particularly for\ncommunication and entertainment products, and the emergence\nof improved power switch technologies, is leading to the use of\nswitching frequencies in the 100s kHz to several MHz range.\nTo improve the overall power density of resonant power\nsupplies, research is now being directed towards converter\ntopologies that can provide multiple regulated outputs\nparticular growth areas being the telecommunications,\ncomputer and microprocessor industries, with mobile phones,\nPDAs and handheld products typically requiring 3.3V, 5V,\n\u00b112V and \u00b115V supplies for various interfaces. However,\ncross-regulation errors that accompany output load variations,\nwhich manifests itself by the regulation of one output voltage\nimpacting on the performance of others, can be a significant\nlimitation for voltage sensitive electronic systems.\nII. MULTI-OUTPUT CONVERTERS\nTo-date, several approaches have been explored to address\ncross-regulation, complexity and overall circuit performance\nissues of multi-output converters, the solutions being divided\ninto three distinct categories. The first regulates a single\nprimary output using closed-loop feedback, with the auxiliary\noutputs being semi-regulated and, therefore, subject to cross-\nregulation error. The second category achieves precise post-\nregulation of each output by using either linear regulators or\nhard-switched dc-dc converters. However, although relatively\nstraightforward to design, such circuits are rarely used in\npractice due to cost constraints. The third category is specific\nto applications which require only two regulated outputs, as is\ncommonly found in signal processing and microprocessor\nbased systems. They avoid the need for post-regulation by\nutilising two closed-loop feedback configurations. A 3rd-order\nLLC converter with two independently controlled outputs was\nreported in [1]. However, optimum performance\ncharacteristics have yet to be forthcoming, primarily due to the\nsignificant complexity associated with the highly non-linear\nbehaviour between the various outputs as a function of load.\nNevertheless, it is a solution that broadly falls within this third\ncategory that is the subject of this paper. Specifically, dual-\noutput resonant LCLC converters, are considered, with control\nof each output being achieved by switching the power devices\nasymmetrically over each half switching cycle using a\ncombination ofPWM and frequency control.\nIII. DUAL O\/P LCLC-SPRC MODEL\nA half-bridge LCLC-SPRC with two outputs is shown in Fig.\n1(a). To demonstrate the ability of the converter to deliver\nasymmetrical output voltages under balanced load conditions,\nthe transformer is constrained to have unity turns-ratios for\nboth outputs and the high- and low-side parallel resonant\ncapacitors are constrained to have identical values. Since\ncurrent flows through the primary side ofthe transformer to the\ntop and bottom sides of the rectifier during different half-\ncycles of tank excitation, see Fig. 1(b), each output is\nreplenished with energy alternately.\nIV. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\nTo achieve zero-voltage switching, the converter is assumed to\noperate on the negative gradient of the input-output frequency\ncharacteristic, above the primary resonant peak. When\noperating in this region, the resulting waveforms can be sub-\ndivided into two distinct time intervals, viz. intervals 1 and 2,\nas depicted in Fig. 1(b):\nInterval 1: Clamping of the parallel capacitor voltage. Here,\nthe combined series inductor Ls+Llp and capacitor Cs provide\nresonant behaviour whilst the voltage across the effective\nparallel tank inductor and capacitor (Lp (Lm) and Cp) is\nclamped by the output voltage. As the current through the\nseries inductor, LS, decays to zero, Cp begins to contribute to\nresonant behaviour, and operation enters the second interval.\n1-4244-0783-4\/07\/$20.00 C 2007 IEEE 2130\nLuo\ntake on a sinusoidal characteristic. Since the outputs are\neffectively disconnected from the tank, both Cp1 and Cp2\nDI contribute to resonant behaviour. Both rectifier currents are\nzero, and the converter outputs are in an 'idle' state with\nRf1 lS energy being supplied solely by the charge on the filter\ncapacitors. By initially neglecting the rectifier on-state\n- | voltage, and noting that the effective parallel resonant\nX2iB R 2 capacitance CL is the sum of the shunt network capacitances\nW C~p and C,2, vcp1 during the capacitor charging period is\ndescribed by:\nST\nSBAv_;\n.1+_\n(a)\nt2\ncp(t= cpi (t, ) + fi n sin(2)7,t)dt\np tl\nwhere lin =iLS-ILp Evaluating (1) with initial\nconditions VR (tl) = VCp1 (tl) = -Vjut2 yields:\n(1)\n(2)\n1i t2\n(b)\nFig.1 Dual-load 4th_order resonant converter (a) schematic (b) typical\noperating waveforms\nInterval 2: Decoupling of the rectifier and output filter. Here,\nall the tank components contribute to resonant behaviour, with\nthe rectifier effectively becoming reverse biased. Current into\nboth the high- and low-side diodes remains zero, and the\nparallel capacitors are charged until their voltage is clamped at\neither +V\u00b1 ,, or -V,,12, thereby providing the boundary at the\nend of this time interval. During each half-cycle of operation,\nthree Modes, Ml, M2, and M3 can be identified, as shown in\nFig. 1(b).\nCircuit Mode Ml (to < t < tl). At the start of Ml, SW2 is\nturned off at to and SWI turned on. The series inductor\ncurrent, iLs, is negative and flows through the internal diode of\nSWI, thereby facilitating ZVS of SWI. Also during this\nperiod, iLs allows D2 to conduct and transfer energy to support\nVOW2, whilst the voltage on Cp2 is clamped to VoW2. All the\nrectifier current, therefore, flows to the load. At the end of Ml,\nthe rectifier current iR2 has decayed to zero, and both the high\nside and low side diodes, and the output filter, are effectively\ndecoupled from the resonant tank.\nCircuit Mode M2 (t < t <t2). Here, the series resonant\ninductor current iLs becomes positive. Since SWI is turned on\nduring Ml, current flow is now through SWI. Initial\nconditions for this mode are that iLs=O and Vcp2= vout2- The\ninductor current iLs and parallel resonant capacitor voltages\nThe boundary for the end of the capacitor charging period is\nVCpl(t2) = +Voutl, which yields the rectifier non-conduction\nangle, Oc, associated with a positive polarity of current, iR,\nthrough the high side rectifier:\nt2 = 2 f xcos K2(0,C)ocv= cos\n(3)\nwhere vtot = vout, + Vout2\nCircuit Mode M3 ( t2 < t < TI \/2). At t t2, D1 becomes\nforward biased whilst D2 reverse biased. The rectifier diode\ncurrent iR2 remains zero throughout the duration ofM3, and DI\nclamps the capacitor voltage vcp, to +Vout\u00b1 until iLs decays to\nzero, at which time the second half cycle of operation\ncommences.\nFor 50%0 duty-cycle excitation, the 2nd half-cycle of operation\nis the mirror image of the first. However, for asymmetrical\nexcitation, the output rectifier diode (D2) non-conduction\nangle, associated with the series resonant inductor current\nbeing of negative polarity, is given by:\nSb2 co -K1 2zfCpvtoj (4)\nwhere ii (is-iLp). The voltage,v across the\nparallel resonant capacitor can, therefore, be expressed as a\nfunction of the angle 0 see Fig. 1(b):\nfor\nK 2 + 2f x (I -cos(9))\n+ Vout2\nvoltl - 2.in6 x (I cos(o))\nVo,t2\n=\n...\u00b0\nfor 0=9 'i..\nfor 0= .+2\nfor\n= 'f + 0c2 2i\n(5)\n2131\nLlp*L-\n+P44 r,;\n,;T+C,921\nI cos(2zf - tl ))\nvcp I (t2 ) = V,,t 2 + ii, x , (t22zf,Cp\nIR\nUnder steady-state conditions, the mean output current ioutl,\nflowing through DI towards the output filter and load, can be\ndetermined from the mean current flowing through the rectifier\nwhen it is of positive polarity.

STATE-VARIABLE ANALYSIS\nA state-variable model describing the behaviour of the dual-\noutput converter can be obtained by considering the electrical\nnetwork shown in Fig. 1 and separating the dynamics into\n'fast' and 'slow' sub-systems, with their interaction related by\na set of coupling equations. The fast sub-system is considered\nto describe the dynamics of the resonant tank and power\nswitches:\ndvcs iLs diLsKf Vcs VLp diLp VLp\ndt Cs dt Ls dt Lp\ndvCpl 'Ls 1Lp -RI tCp2 1R2 dvCp2 'Ls 1Lp 1R2 tCpl -RI\ndt Cpl dt Cp2\n(1 1)\nThe output filter dynamics are described by:\ndvcf I - 'RI Vcf 1 dvcf 2 1R2 Vcf 2 (12)\ndt Cf1 CfIRLI dt Cf 2 Cf2RL2\nAs discussed, during interval t1-4 t2 (see Fig. 1(b)) vcpl is\nclamped to vcf, during the positive half-cycle, and conversely,\nto\n-vcf2 during the negative half-cycle, due to the action of the\ndiodes. By noting that there will be negligible current flowing\nthrough Cp during these periods, the rectifier input voltage is\ndependent on the direction of the current leaving the resonant\ntank inductances, i.e. iL = iLs -iLp .

By\nway of example, the parameters of a candidate converter are\n2132\n(15)\n-I )Ziouti -)7fscp Vtotoc, = Cos\nMout, + )7fscpVtot\n \ngiven in Table I when supplied from a 30V dc link. A plot of\nthe resulting steady-state output voltage characteristics of the\nconverter, Vf0t, and VW2, as a function of switching frequency\nand duty-cycle ratio is given in Fig. 2. It is evident that for\noperation above resonance, the sum of the output voltages\napplied to the loads increases as the operating frequency tends\nto the effective resonant frequency, for fixed values of duty-\ncycle ratio. Furthermore, for a 50O duty-cycle, giving\nsymmetric square-wave excitation of the tank, the converter\ndelivers identical voltages to both the high side and low side\noutputs, for a fixed operating frequency, as expected.\nFor a given operating frequency, a decrease in the duty-cycle\nratio, from 500O, is seen to deliver more energy from the\nresonant tank to energize output V,,tl, thereby yielding a\ncorrespondingly higher output voltage and power, and vice-\nversa. It is, therefore, clear that for balanced loads, the voltage\nand power distribution to each output can be independently\ninfluenced by a suitable choice of duty ratio and switching\nfrequency. For completeness, Fig. 3 compares the ratio of the\ntwo realisable output voltages, from which it can be seen that\nthe slope of the curve is greater for lower values of switching\nfrequency. This implies that when a large difference between\nthe output voltages is required, the converter should be\noperated close to resonance, leading to high efficiency\noperation, and zero voltage switching. However, this also\nmeans that the tank components are subjected to higher\nelectrical stresses.\nFor asymmetric excitation of the converter, the duties of SWI\nand SW2 are denoted, respectively, by D and 1-D, where D is\nthe ratio of the turn-on period with respect to the switching\nperiod. Asymmetric switching therefore provides an\nasymmetrical voltage source Vin to excite the tank, of\namplitude VDC:\nJn {VDCi -\n0=0...2zD\n9 = 2zD ...2ff\nAssuming that only the fundamental component excites the\nresonant tank, and applying the relationship\ntan- (cos(o)\/sin(O)) =T\/2+0, the fundamental of the input\nvoltage, Vin(1), and its phase angle, 5vi(l) are given by:\nVi(=DC1 - cos(2)D) x sin(OX + vi(1) ) vi(1) = 2--,I (21)\nThe condition for inductive switching can now be written as\nAnz(O.5-D), where,3in is the phase lag between the\nfundamental of the input voltage and current).\nTABLE I\nCONVERTER MODEL PARAMETERS\nParameters Value\nCharacteristic impedance (Q) 2.5\nResonant frequency,fj (kHz) 130\nResonant capacitance ratio, C, 0.03\nResonant inductance ratio, L, 0.01\nSeries load quality factor, Q0p' 6\nle .\nIS-~\n14 -\n12 I-:30\n140 -qu\nFrequeny (kHz) 20 [Duty (%)\nFig.2 Variation of output voltage distribution with switching\nfrequency and duty-cycle ratio\nDuty P\nFig.3 Variation of normalised asymmetrical output voltage with\nswitching frequency and duty-cycle ratio\nVI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nMeasured results have been obtained on an experimental\nconverter with a step-down capability, the measured\ncomponent values being given in Table II. A ferrite core, 3F3,\nsuitable for high frequency applications, was used for both the\ntransformer core and the resonant inductor. Since the\ntransformer leakage inductances are dependent on the winding\narrangement, the secondaries were bifilar wound adjacent to\nthe core, beneath the primary winding, so as to reduce\nsecondary leakage flux.\nTABLE II\nPROTOTYPE DUAL OUTPUT CONVERTER COMPONENT VALUES\nParameter Value\nDC link input voltage, VDC (V) 15\nSeries resonant inductances, L, (,uH) 0.85\nSeries resonant capacitances, C, (,F) 1.5\nHigh side parallel resonant capacitances, CP1 (Ff) 0.116\nLow side parallel resonant capacitances, CP2 (,F) 0.116\nLoad resistance, RL (Q) 4\nTransformer turns ratio 1\nFilter capacitance, Cf (,F) 100\nTransformer output leakage inductance, LI, (,uH) 0.1\nMagnetising inductance, Lm (,uH) 109\nTransformer primary leakage inductance, LIP (,uH) 0.7\n2133\nThe parallel resonant inductor is designed to be on the\ntransformer primary side, such that Lp utilises the magnetising\ninductance, Lmn of the transformer. The effective series\ninductance comprises of the series inductor, Ls, and the\nprimary leakage inductance, LIp, and was measured as 1.55gH.\nThe transformer output networks have two identical\ninductances and the assignment of the polarity of the rectifier\ncurrent is realised through winding orientation. A comparison\nof the output voltage obtained from the state variable model\n(11-19), simulated to steady-state, with SPICE simulation\nresults and measurements, is given in Fig. 4. As is clearly\nevident, the correlation between the theoretical predictions and\nthe experimental data is extremely good. Moreover, a\ncomparison of simulated and measured characteristics, when\nduty-cycle ratio control is employed, has also been obtained at\nan operating frequency off,=150 kHz. The results are shown\nin Fig. 5 from which it can be seen that the proposed state-\nvariable model provides sufficient accuracy for design and\nanalysis purposes, the maximum error being <500. The\nminimum duty-cycle ratio atf,=150 kHz is selected to be 25%\nin order to prevent the converter from entering the capacitive\nconduction mode.\nVII. CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL\nA basic digital control scheme has been realised to demonstrate\nclosed-loop regulation of both dual output voltages when\nsubjected to load and line voltage disturbances. The structure\nof the control methodology, which employs two decoupled\nfeedback loops for independent control of frequency and duty-\ncycle ratio, is shown in Fig. 6. Voltage feedback modulation is\nemployed to avoid the need for relatively expensive current\nsensors, and the control structures are based on linear\nproportional compensators in this case, as a proof of principle.\nFor design purposes, the output voltage versus switching\nfrequency and duty-cycle ratio characteristics of the converter\nare approximated to be linear over the frequency range of\ninterest (f,=156 to 220 kHz). Although various methodologies\ncould be considered for the design of the compensator gains,\nthe controller parameters are selected empirically for robust\ntracking of the references. Here then, parameters for the\ndecoupled SISO controllers are chosen for good transient\nresponse and disturbance rejection. Notably, the digital\ncompensator is tuned to respond quickly to variations of V0,1,,\nwhilst the controller reacting to variations of V,,12, acts\nrelatively slowly, thereby allowing an effective decoupling of\nthe control loops, for simplicity. The prototype converter\ncontroller is shown in Fig. 7. The converter (see Table II for\nparameters) is required to provide regulated +5V and +3.3V\noutputs from a DC link input voltage in the range 15V to 20V.\nFigure 8 shows the steady-state error between the reference\nvoltages, Vrefl and Vrej2, and the resulting measured output\nvoltages of the converter, over the specified range of DC link\ninput voltages (I5V to 20V) with a 5Q load.\n4\no 35\n0 3\n45\n, 3\nT\n160 180 200 220 240 260 280\nFrequency (kHz)\nFig. 4 Output voltage vs switching frequency\nA\nA Y A stat6.\nAf\nhii\nA\na\n0 35 40 45i 50 55\nDi (a)\n(a)\n50 6 70\n(b)\nFig. 5 Control characteristic curves forf,=150 kHz (a) high side\noutput, and (b) low side output.\nTwo degree\nfreedom controller\nVrf\nVr2\nFig. 6 Closed-loop control of the dual-load converter.\n2134\n- SPICE\nMeasured\nA State\n3)\n1)\n5\nfrequency control, and good start-up transient behaviour on\nboth outputs under a range of operating conditions.\nHr, r- r r- T- rT- r- T- r-.\ng 3 | ;fW >(fX~~~*lpirlllrfAflAXF ti4ll8jsjt{,illfi {0>Hiltuf\nA41,\n-4,8 V=A V\n46 Operatirg po nt;\n> frequency 1k60Hz\nO 4A4 23% duty cyc1\n4 42\n36-\nref2\n36 A\nll - Voutl = 5V\nV.,A2 3.3V\nD\n.CC6 0.01 0.015 0.0i2 O.CfY5 O.CfB 0.cf5 0.04 0.015\nine (s)\n(a)\n61:'\nOperating 06iht.\ndfrequeny 156cez\n20% duty cycle\n,4.,- a.~\n~fi & A \",\n5 1 5 16 165 17 17,5 18 18,515 195 20\nDC InrutVOl tage V)\nFig. 8 Output voltage regulation vs. input voltage\nIt can be seen that the maximum regulation error for both\noutputs is <5%. Finally, Fig. 9 shows the response of the\nconverter resulting from transient start-up conditions, for a\nrange of applied input voltages and dual output voltage ratios.\nIt can be seen that the converter voltages converge rapidly to\nthe reference values, with an initial overshoot of -10%,\ncorresponding to an equivalent 2nd_order damping ratio of\n4-0.6.\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\nThe characteristics of dual-load, 44-order LCLC voltage-\noutput resonant converters, have been explored. State-variable\nmodels have been derived. From the output voltage distribution\nderived from an example converter, the impact of the converter\ndesign parameters on the attainable output voltage ratio has\nbeen investigated, and subsequent design trade-offs have been\ndiscussed. Furthermore, the condition and minimum frequency\nwhich is necessary to preserve ZVS has been given for high\nefficiency converter operation. A comparison of\nmeasurements from an experimental converter, capable of\ndelivering 5V and 3.3V, with predictions from the derived\nstate-variable model and SPICE simulations, shows that the\nstate-variable model provides accurate predictions of output\nvoltage under steady-state conditions. Moreover, a basic\ncontrol scheme to allow reliable regulation of both outputs, has\nbeen realised, with steady-state measurements showing\nindependent regulation using a combination of duty-cycle and\nV_t 5V\nV.,t 3.3V\nTirnre(s)\n(b)\nFig. 9 Start-up transient response for various dual output voltage ratios and\nDC-link input voltages (a) vDc-l5V, V0,,t 5V, V0,,2=3.3V; () vDcl-20V,\nV0.t1=5V, V0.t2=3.3V\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
