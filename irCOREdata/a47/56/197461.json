They are objectively \ninterdependent because their payoffs are determined by each other's \nchoices, but they are ignorant not only of the payoff structure of the \ngame (as in other games of incanplete infonnation) but also of the fact \nthat they are involved in a game of strategy. \nThe following lifelike interpretation of the minimal social situation \n(Colman, 1982a, pp. 289-291) provides a useful intuitive background. Two \nccmnuters travel on the same train every day. They always sit in adjacent \ncanpartments, roth of which are uncanfortably cold. Each canpartment has \na lever marked \"heater\", but there is no indication as to whether it \nshould be turned to the left or right to increase the temperature. What \nthe ccmnuters do not know is that there is a fault in the electrical \nwiring of the train: moving either lever to the left increases the \ntemperature and moving it to the right decreases the temperature in the \nadjacent canpartment. As a consequence of this, when either of the \nccmnuters turns the lever to the left or right, the other ccmnuter is \nrewarded with warmth or punished with cold. The ccmnuters cannot \ninfluence their own payoffs directly; their canfort or discanfort depends \nentirely on each other's choices, though neither of them realizes this. \nThey would nonetheless roth benefit if they turned their levers to the \nleft at the beginning of every journey. The following interesting \nquestion arises: Can they learn to cooperate in this way in spite of their \nignorance of their interdependence and even, perhaps, of each other's \nexistence? If so, then people can learn to cooperate without any \n4 \ndeliberate intention or awareness of the need for cooperation and without \neven knowing that they are involved in a social interaction. \nSidowski, Wyckoff, and Tabory (1956) and Sidawski (1957) provided \nexperimental evidence showing that pairs of subjects can--and generally \ndo--leam to cooperate in the minimal social situation, and this finding \nhas been replicated many times (Kelley, Thibaut, Radloff, &Mundy, 1962; \nRabinowitz, Kelley, & Rosenblatt, 1966; Arickx & Van Averrnaet, 1981). In \nthe original experiments, a situation strategically equivalent to the \ncanmuters' dilemma was engineered as follows. Pairs of subjects were \nseated in separate rooms, unaware of each other's existence, and \nelectrodes were attached to their bodies. Each subject faced an apparatus \ncomprising a pair of buttons, which for convenience we shall label 0 and \n1, and a digital display showing the cumulative total of points scored. \nTheir instructions were to press one of the buttons on each trial, \nattempting always to maximize rewards (points) and to minimize punishments \n(shocks). The electrical wiring was arranged in such a way that on every \ntrial a 0 choice delivered a point and a 1 choice a shock to the other \nsubject. In more recent experiments similar devices have been used, \nexcept that negative payoffs have usually involved deduction of points \nrather than electric shocks . \nFigure 1 about here \nThe payoff matrix of the minimal social situation is shawn in Figure \n1. It is unnecessary to assign numerical values to the matrix elements : \nwe need to assume only that each player prefers a positive payoff (+) to a \nnegative payoff (-). One player chooses row 0 or 1, and the other player \n5 \n\nchooses column 0 or 1. If both choose 0, then the outcome is the top left \ncell and both receive positive payoffs. If both choose 1, then both \nreceive negative payoffs. If one chooses 0 and the other chooses 1, then \nthe O-chooser receives a negative payoff and the 1-chooser receives a \npositive payoff. The rules of the game usually stipulate that the players \nchoose simultaneously, although sequential choosing has also been \nstudied. The payoff structure of Figure 1, called mutual fate control by \nThibaut and Kelley (1959), has been used in most empirical investigations \nof the minimal social situation. It is obviously isomorphic with the \ncommuters' dilemma described earlier. \nWhen the game is repeated many times, pairs of subjects generally \nlearn to coordinate their choices while remaining unaware of their \nstrategic interdependence (Sidowski, Wyckoff, &Tabory, 1956; Sidowski, \n1957; Kelley, Thibaut, Radloff, &MUndy, 1962; Rabinowitz, Kelley, & \nRosenblatt, 1966; Arickx &Van Avermaet, 1981) . Although they usually \nassume (incorrectly) that their payoffs are determined in some way by \ntheir awn choices, they tend to choose 0 with increasing frequency over \ntrials. In the long run, pairs of subjects often settle dawn to choosing \no on every occasion. Subjects behave as if they were learning to \ncooperate, although from their point of view the situation is entirely \nnon-social. How can this effect be explained? Kelley et al . . proposed \nthat subjects in the minimal social situation and similar games of \nincomplete information learn to adopt a win-stay, lose-change principle, \nwhich is merely an application of Thorndike's (1911) law of effect. The \nprinciple does not generate any prediction about the players' initial \nchOices, but if the game is played more than once it implies that a player \nwill repeat any choice that is followed by a positive payoff and switch to \n6 \n\nthe other choice after receiving a negative payoff . If both players \nchoose 0 on the first trial, for example, then both receive positive \npayoffs and, according to the win-stay, lose-change principle, both will \nchoose 0 on the second and all subsequent trials. We can represent the \noutcomes on successive trials by a sequence of ordered pairs corresponding \nto the row and column players' choices respectively: \n(0,0), (0,0), (0,0), .... \nIf both players choose 1 on the first trial, then both receive negative \npayoffs which cause them to switch to 0 on the second trial, and these 0 \nchoices are repeated on all subsequent trials: \n(1, 1), (0,0), (0, 0), (0, 0), .... \nIf one player initially chooses 0 and the other chooses 1, then the \nO-chooser receives a negative payoff and therefore switches to 1 on the \nsecond trial, and the i-chooser receives a positive payoff and therefore \nsticks with 1 on the second trial. On the second trial, therefore, both \nplayers will choose 1, followed (as shown above) by 0 on all subsequent \ntrials: \n(0,1), (1,1), (0,0), (0,0), \n(1,0), (1,1), (0,0), (0,0), \nIt is clear from this analysis that players who follow the win-stay, \nlose-change principle learn to cooperate--to choose mutually rewarding \nstrategies--by the third trial at the latest, and continue to cooperate \nindefinitely after that. \nExperimental evidence shows, however, that people do not generally \nfollow the win-stay, lose-change principle rigidly (Rabinowitz, Kelley, & \nRosenblatt, 1966; Burnstein, 1969, Arickx & Van Averrnaet, 1981; Colman, \n1982b). In general, cooperative 0 choices begin to exceed chance \n- -\n7 \n\nfrequency after a few trials and continue to increase in frequency; after \n100 trials aOOut 75 per cent of choices are cooperative. According to the \nwin-stay, lose-change prinCiple, of course, 100 per cent cooperation \nshould occur after three trials. This means that players in the minimal \nsocial situation do not obey the law of effect strictly. But cooperative \nbehaviour does tend to evolve and, in the light of overwhe1ming evidence \nfrom other branches of psychology, it seems reasonable to assume that \npeople are governed to a large extent by the law of effect and therefore \nthat they tend to follCM the win-stay, lose-change principle. This \nimplies that the probability of a player's choice on trial! being \nrepeated on trial t + 1 increases if the player is rewarded and decreases \nif the player is punished on trial t (Arickx &Van Avermaet, 1981). \nIn the sections that follCM, we propose to generalize the minimal \nsocial situation to groups of arbitrary size. We shall then investigate \nthe consequences of the win-stay, lose-change principle in these n-person \ngames and characterize the circumstances that result in joint cooperation. \nGENERALIZATION 'ID N-PERSON GROUPS \nPreliminary formalization \nThe ~-person minimal social situation is a game involving ~ ~ 2 \nplayers, each of whom has a uniquely designated predecessor and \nsuccessor. The game can be represented by a cyclic graph of valency 2. \nIt is useful to imagine the ~ players sitting round a table, so that that \nl's predecessor is n and n's successor is 1. Each player has a choice of \ntwo strategies, 0 and 1, so the choices of the ~ players on a specified \ntrial can be represented by an n-vector of zeros and ones which we call a \nconfiguration. If a player chooses 0, then that player ' s successor \nreceives a positive payoff, and if a player chooses 1 then that player's \n8 \n\nsuccessor receives a negative payoff. According to the win-stay, \nlose-change principle, any player who receives a positive payoff will \nrepeat the same strategy choice on the following trial, and any player who \nreceives a negative payoff will switch strategies on the following trial. \nFor any configuration, therefore, there is a unique configuration that \nfollaYS it according to the win-stay, lose-change principle. A \nconfiguration consisting entirely of zeros will be repeated on all \nsubsequent trials. Any configuration that leads ultimately to this zero \nconfiguration is called cooperative. The analysis in the previous section \nshaYS that in the two-person minimal social situation, which is merely a \nspecial case of the general ~-person game, all configurations are \ncooperative. \nSome typical configurations in a Six-person minimal social situation \nwill illustrate these ideas. In this game, the configuration (1, 0, 1, 0, \n1, 0) is followed on the next trial by (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), and then by (0, \n0, 0, 0, 0, 0); the initial configuration (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0) is therefore \ncooperative. On the other hand, the configuration (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) \ngenerates the following sequence: (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) , (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0), \n(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0) , (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1) , (0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0) , (0, 0, 1, 1, \n1, 1), (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), and the initial configuration is repeated. \nSuch a configuration will evidently cycle for ever, never reaching (0, 0, \n0, 0, 0, 0), which shaYS that the initial configuration is noncooperative. \nAn arbitrary configuration in an ~-person minimal social situation can \nbe represented by the vector \n(~l' ~2' ... , Xn), \nwhere Xi E {O, 1}. The numbers \u00b0 and 1 can be regarded as elements of \nthe field GF(2) of integers modulo 2. In the configuration (Yl' ... , \n9 \n\nYn) immediately following (~l' ... , x,,), since 0 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 0, \nand 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1 in GF(2), \nXi if Xi - 1 = 0 \nYi = \nXi + 1 if Xi - 1 = 1, \nwhere the subscripts are reduced modulo n. Therefore, \nYi = Xi - 1 + Xi (~= 1, ... , n) . \nThe configuration immediately following (~l' ... , x,,) is therefore \nobtained by applying the linear transformation \n:!': (~l' ... , x,,)' -~ (x\" + ~l' ~l + ~2' ... , x,,-l + x,,)' \nwhere x' denotes the transpose of the row vector x. The transfonnation \nmatrix is an ~-square matrix :!' = [!u.] in which \nf: ifi = j or i = j + 1 ti j = otherwise. \nThe general form of the transformation matrix is shown in Table 1. \nTable 1 about here \nIf the initial configuration is ~ = (~l' ... , x,,), then the \nsequence of configurations (represented by transposed row vectors) on \nsubsequent trials will be Tx', :!,2~', :!,3~', .... An initial \nconfiguration is cooperative, therefore, if Tkx' = (0, 0, ... , 0)' for \nsame~, that is, if x = (~l' ... , x,,) lies in the kernel of the linear \ntransformation Tk for same k. \n10 \n\nFURMAL RESULTS \nTheorem 1. If the configuration (~l' ... , Xn) is followed \nimmediateley by (0, 0, ... , 0), then either (~l' ... , Xn) = (0, 0, \n... , 0) or (~l' ... , Xn) = ( 1 , 1, ... , 1). \nProof. If Xi = 0, then Xi _1 = 0, otherwise the ~th canponent of \nthe transfonned vector Tx' would be 1. Similarly, bearing in mind that 1 \n+ 1 = 0 in GF(2), if Xi = 1, then Xi - 1 = 1, otherwise the ith \ncanponent of the transfonned vector would be 1. This theorem establishes \nthat the only configurations that are immediately followed by joint \ncooperation are those in which all players make the same choice. \nTheorem 2. If ~ is odd, then the only cooperative configurations are \n(0,0, ... ,0) and (1,1, ... ,1). \nProof. If Tx' = (0, 0, ... ,0)', then it follows fram Theorem 1 that \neither X = (0, 0, ... ,0) or X = (1,1, ... ,1), and if (0, 0, ... ,0) is \nnot the initial configuration, then it must be preceded by (1, 1, ... , \n1). Suppose that (1, 1, ... , 1) is also not the initial configuration. \nThen Tw' = (1, 1, ... , 1)' for same w. Now if Wi = 0, then Wi - 1 = 1, \notherwise the ith component of Tw' would be zero. For the same reason, if \nWi = 1, then Wi - 1 = O. Therefore, Wi - 2 = Wi. Consider the vector \ncomponent Wn: since ~ is odd, wn = wn - 2 = = ~l. This implies \nthat if ~l = 0, then ~l-l = wn = 0, and if ~l = 1, then ~l-l = \nwn = 1, which yields a contradiction. We have therefore proved that if \nthe number of players is odd, joint cooperation is achieved only if all \nplayers make the same initial choice, and it results after one trial at \nmost. \nTheorem 3. If j = 2~, E E Z+ (where Z+ is the set of \nnonnegative integers), then \n20 \n11 \n\nTj: (~l' ... , Xn) -j- (~l-i + ~l' ... , Xn-i + Xn), \nwhere the subscripts are expressed modulo ~. \nProof. Assume that the result is true for sane E. Then, if 9 = 2~, \n'I'C1: (~l' ... , Xn) --1(~1-'-.9- + ~l' ... , Xn-.9- + Xn)\u00b7 \nThe proof proceeds by induction on E. For E + 1, 2P+l = 29, and T2q = \n... , Xn) ... , Yn ), \nwhere \nbecause, whether xi -.9- = 0 or 1, xi -.9- + xi -.9- = O. Thus, \n:!,2~: (~l' ... , Xn) --1 (~1-2.9- + ~l' ... , Xn-2.9- + Xn)\u00b7 \nWe have proved that if the result holds for sane E then it holds for E + \n1. \t The final step is to ShCM that it holds for E = O. In that case 9 = \n= 1, and Tl = T is the basic transformation \n:!': (~l' ... , Xn) -1 (Xn + ~l' ~l + ~2' ... , Xn - 1 + Xn) \nfor which the result holds. We have therefore proved that any number of \ntrials j that is a pCMer of 2 takes each component Xi of the \nconfiguration ~ into Xi + Xi'- i \nTheorem 4. A configuration (~l' ... , Xn) in an ~-person minimal \nsocial situation is cooperative iff Xi = Xi-~ for all ~, where ~ = \nbk, ~ = 2':', ~, !? E ~+ (the set of nonnegative integers), and b is odd. \nProof. Fran Theorem 3 we have \nTj: (~l' ... , Xn) -7 (~l- i + ~l' ... , Xn - i + Xn), \nwhere j = 2~, E E ~+. The kernel of Tj is therefore \n~l-i + ~l = ... = Xn-i + Xn = O}= {(~l' ... , \nXi = xi+i for all i}.= {(~l' ... , \nSince ker TP is a subset of ker TP + 1 for all natural numbers E, the \nset of cooperative states is ker TP if ker TP = ker 'J:I11 for E < m. \n- -\n-- ---\n12 \n\nThe proof is constructive: we shall prove that if k = 2:, ~ = 2k = \nLet ~ = (~+ 1)\/2. Then b = 2c - 1, and hence kb = k(2c - 1). Thus \n2ck =k (mod kb), that is, \nan = k (mod n) . \nNew, if x E ker Tn, then Xi = Xi +!!l for all ~ (mod!:). It follaws \nthat xi+!!l = X i + 2 !!l = X i + 3 !!l \u2022\u2022\u2022 , and therefore, since c is a positive \ninteger, that \nXi = Xi +cm for all i (mod!:). \nSince an = k (mod !:), \nXi = Xi +~ for all ~ (mod!:), \nwhich shews that X E ker Tk. We have therefore proved that ker Tn is \na subset of ker Tk, and hence, since ~ < ~, that \nker Tk = ker Tn, \nas required. \nThis theorem shaws that we can characterize the cooperative \nconfigurations in an !:-person minimal social situation as follaws. If n \nis odd, then the cooperative configurations are (~l' ... , Xn) such \nthat Xi = X i + 1 for all ~ (mod ~). If ~ is even, then if ~ is the \nhighest power of 2 that divides n evenly, then the cooperative \nconfigurations are (~l' ... , Xn) such that Xi = Xi +~ for all i \n(mod n). \nThe proof also implies that, in an !:-person minimal social situation, \nif ~ is the highest power of 2 that divides ~ evenly, the first ~ players \nmay choose arbitrarily, but the choices of the remaining players are \ndetermined for the configuration to be cooperative. It follows that the \nnumber of cooperative initial configurations is 2k. \n13 \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nAn abstract theory, if it is to be useful, should do two things. First, \nit should explain existing empirical data. Second, it should provide \nconclusions whose scope extends beyond existing data but can be \nempirically tested. The fonnal system developed in this paper explains \nexisting data ina trivial sense, inasmuch as it incorporates the theory \nand experimental findings related to the two-person minimal social \nsituation as a special case. \nThe win-stay, lose-change principle, which has been used to explain \nthe evolution of cooperation in the two-person game, is derived from the \nlaw of effect, originally formulated by Thorndike (1911) as follows: \n, 'Responses which are accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction \n[are] more firmly connected with the situation ... i those which are \naccompanied or closely folla..,red by discomfort ... have their connections \nwith the situation weakened\" (p. 244). (Thorndike later \"repealed\" the \nsecond part, which is sometimes called the negative law of effect.) Many \nbehaviorist psychologists, including Skinner (1966, 1984), regard the law \nof effect as a behavioral parallel of natural selection in which only the \nmost successful responses in an organism's behavioral repertoire survive \nwhile the unsuccessful responses became extinct. Several decades of \npsychological research have provided abundant corroboration of the law of \neffect in a wide variety of situations. It would be most surprising if it \nwere found not to apply in the minimal social situation. It is worth \npointing out, ha..,rever, that the win-stay, lose-change principle is an \nidealized version of the law of effect in which responses that are \nrewarded are invariably repeated and those that are punished are never \nrepeated on the folla..,ring trial--the principle, unlike the law of effect, \n14 \n\nis deterministic and non-cumulative. It is clear, however, that the broad \noutline of the theory presented in this paper would remain valid if a \nstochastic version of the win-stay, lose-change principle based on \nprobabilistic learning theory were substituted. \nThe formal results certainly extend beyond the scope of existing \nempirical data. .Many of the predictions that can be derived fran the \nanalysis are counterintuitive but nevertheless easily testable. Among the \ninteresting predictions that should be tested are the following. First, \nalthough the frequency of rewarding choices and joint cooperation tends to \nincrease in the two-person minimal social Situation, the theory predicts \nno such increase in odd-sized groups. Second, whenever the number of \nplayers is even but not a power of two, configurations that are \ncooperative according to the theory should progress toward joint \ncooperation more frequently than noncooperative configurations. Third, \nmulti-person groups in which the number of players is a power of two \nshould behave like players in the two-person minimal social situation: \nirrespective of the choices made on the first trial, there should be \nsteady progress toward joint cooperation. Fourth, the frequency of \nrewarding choices and joint cooperation should correlate with the number \nof cooperative initial configurations detennined by the theory. If any of \nthese predictions turns out to be wrong, then the assumptions of the \ntheory will have to be modified. \nREFERENCES \nArickx, M. & Van Averrnaet, E.
