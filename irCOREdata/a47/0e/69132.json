For \nexample, how -, indeed do -, global architects embed ensure the buildings they \ndesign are \u2017in place\u2018 and in their localappropriate for the context urban cultural, \neconomic, social and political contexts of the places they are to be built in? \nThe aim of the paper is to consider this question. I take \u2017regulation\u2018 in its \nbroadest sense and explore the role of standards and codes as well as other \nforms of social regulation in the process of emplacing designs. I argue that in \norder to understand how buildings are put in their place analysis is needed of \nboth the design side adaptations architects make to buildings but also the \nconsumption side regulation of designs and the way the behaviours of those \ninhabiting buildings produce \u2017local\u2018 meaning.  \n \n \nKeywords: architecture;  globalization;  regulation;  professional service firms \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction  \n \nThe \u2017global\u2018 architect has a long history. Le Corbusier was arguably one \nof the first global star architects to capture the public imagination \nthrough design work \u2013 a \u2017starchitect\u2018 \u2013 whilst American architects like \nJacob Wrey Mould were exporting designs such as the steel framed \nbuilding in the late 1800s (Cody, 2003). Today, \u2017global architects\u2018  the \nlikes of Foster and Koolhaus fulfil similar roles to Le Corbusier and Wrey \nMould and are household names thanks to their constant media \nexposure. But the latter half of the twentieth century was also, however, \ncharacterised by a new trend in relation to the \u2017globalization of\u2018 \narchitectural practice;, the the emergence and maturation of global firms \nsuch as Gensler (established 1966), Kohn Pederson Fox (1976) and \nSkidmore Owens & Merill (SOM) (1936) that have \u2017global\u2018 network \noperations throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The tall building \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\n 3 \nor skyscraper has come to represent the work of these firms as well as \nthe work of global architects such as Forster and KoolhausIn terms of \nthe work of these global architects, iIt is the tall building or skyscraper \nthat has become a symbol of the work of these global architects, their \nendeavours (McNeill, 2005a). and W whilst often controversial, cities \nfrom Beijing (McNeill, 2006), to London (Charney, 2007) and Sydney \n(O\u2018Neill and McGuirk, 2003) have called upon starchitects and global \nfirms architects and global firms for the development of \u2017iconic\u2018 tall office \nbuildings designed to represent the world city status of these \nmetropolises. \n \nThe emergence of global architecture firms like SOM who specialise in \nwhat Winch and Schneider (1993) call \u2017strong service\u2018, managing \ncomplex projects and meeting the needs of demanding corporate \nclients, and their role alongside the contemporary \u2017starglobal architects \nsuch as architects\u2018 such as Foster and Koolhaus, whos specialise in the \ndesign of iconic buildings (Jencks, 2006) has had a significant impact \nonin the production of city architectures and raises a number of \nquestions for social scientists. For example, as McNeill (2005, 2007, \n2008) asks, how do global firms and architects and their firms \n 4 \ncoordinate work across space? Relatedly, and perhaps most \nfundamentally, how, indeed do, global architects fulfil what is assumed \nto be a basic principal of all architectural work, the embedding of a \nbuilding in its local context? The aim of the paper is to consider examine \nthis question issue by considering the forces that regulate the work of \nglobal architecture firms and architects (both the starchitects studios of \nthe stars such as Koolhaus and firms like SOM) and \u2017put it in itsdesigns \nin their place\u2018, i.e. the forces that contextualise the design of a building \nso that its appearance, spatial architecture, facilities and identity are \nmeaningful to those inhabiting and consuming it and appropriate for the \n\u2017local\u2018 cultural, economic, political and social context. In doing this I \nexamine \u2017regulation\u2018 in the broadest sense and explore the role of \nstandards and codes as well as other forms of social regulation. \n \nTo frame analysis of such diverse forms of regulation and its affects on \nthe work of global architects I explore the relevance of theoretical work \nfrom economic geography that examines the governance of \ntransantionaltransnational corporations and the global production \nnetworks they develop (Dicken et al., 2001; Hess, 2004) alongside work \nfrom urban and cultural geography that examines the social production \n 5 \nof architecture (Bunnell, 1999; Goss, 1988; Jacobs, 2006; Lees, 2001; \nKnox, 1987). In doing this I argue that a subtle understanding of how \nbuildings produced by global architecture firms and global architects are \n\u2017put in their place\u2018 requires analysis of both the design side adaptations \nregulation of thearchi architect\u2018s\u2018 work (adaptations made as architects \nmake as they design the building) but also the regulation of the \nconsumption side regulation of the building (and the way the behaviours \nof those consuming and inhabiting buildings imbue a design with \u2017local\u2018 \nmeaning). Together, I argue, the complex interweaving of the design \nand consumption sides regulation means that whilst from the exterior a \nbuilding might, for example, look like just another SOM tower, and whilst \nthe global firm or architect might actually consider \nher\/himselfthemselves to be designing a \u2017global\u2018 rather than a local \nbuilding, their work of global architects and global firms of global \narchitects actually leads to distinctly \u2017local\u2018 buildings that have a more \ndistinctive \u2017localocal\u2018 identity thant might be first realised. My findings, \ntherefore, support the claims of those who argue against globalization \nbeing a process of cultural homogenisation (Cody, 2003; King, 2004). \nThey and also reveals the multiple ways in which seemingly \ndisembedded firms are regulated and embedded in the cultural, \n 6 \neconomics, political and social contexts of the places they build in, thus \nsuggesting that existing professional\/knowledge intensive business \nservice theories and their focus on the role of embedded local offices in \nthe adaptation of services to local contexts used to understand the \nglobalization of cultural industries such as architecture and advertising \nneed adaptingdeveloping to take into account the multiple and often \nunexpected ways that cultural-economic products such as buildings or \nadverts become \u2017local\u2018 and gain situated identities.    \n \n \nGeographies of global architects and architecture firms \n \nGlobal architecture firms with a network of offices in multiple countries, \nwhat Rimmer (1991) calleds the global intelligence corp (GIC) (table 1), \nspecialise in meeting the needs of their (often transnational) clients \nworldwide. and claim to have the capacity to build innovative yet \nrelatively financially efficient buildings wherever needed. At first glance, \nthen, these firms appear to resemble other global \nprofessional\/knowledge intensive business service firms such as \naccountancy (Beaverstock, 1996), advertising (Faulconbridge, 2006), \n 7 \nlaw (Faulconbridge, 20008) and executive search (Faulconbridge et al., \n2008). Accordingly, it might be expected that the globalization strategy \nof the GIC firms has involved following their clients (primarily property \ndevelopers) worldwide as they invest in developed and developing \nmarkets. GIC firms might whilst also be expected to make making \nstrategic investments in markets where future demand domestic for \narchitectural services is likely to be high (e.g. China). Indeed, as Gensler \nlikes to suggest,  They claim to have the capacity to build innovative yet \nrelatively financially efficient buildings wherever needed. As Gensler \nlikes to suggest, \u2015Our global reach\u2014to cities large and small\u2014allows us \nto integrate an international perspective with an intimate knowledge of \nlocal practices and context\u2016 (http:\/\/www.gensler.com\/about\/index.html). \nYet the story of the globalization of GIC firms is not as simple as it might \nfirst appear.  \n \n[Insert table 1 here] \n \nGIC firms build everything from hospitals to hotels but tend to specialise \nin the \u2017tall building\u2018 (McNeill, 2005a) as well as major urban \nredevelopments schemes consisting of multiple skyscrapers and large \n 8 \nchunks of public space (Olds, 2001). In any one city or country there are \na limited number of such large scale projects and, as a result, the \nlocation of the GIC firms\u2018 work is geographically diverse with firms rarely \nhaving more than one project in a city or country. The clients of the firms \nare also diverse with repeat business occurring overat intervals of many \nyears not weeks or months. Consequently, operating as a global firm \nposes significant challenges in terms of the delivery of design services. \nUnlike advertising, law and other professional\/knowledge intensive \nbusiness services, global architecture firms: (a) cannot just follow their \nclients overseas and open offices in vicinityclose to to key sources of \nrepeat work because of their diverseity of clients base and the long time \nscales involved in repeat work; (b) cannot locate permanent offices \nclose to much of their work because of the project-based nature of \narchitecture and the fact that it is unlikely the firm will have another \nproject in the same city in the immediate future. Globalization for \narchitecture firms, therefore, involves approaches to service deliver that \nare subtly different to other global service firms. \n \nAs both McNeill (2008) and Olds (2001) report, this means the \nglobalization of GIC firms and the opening of overseas offices can only \n 9 \nbe explained by considering three interrelated issues. First, GIC firms \nengage in globalization partly to ensure their brand and reputation is \nassociated with mega-projects and the ever growing group of global \nfirms. Both in the architecture profession, but also in the eyes of clients, \nthe status of an architect as a \u2017global\u2018 is part of the allure of firms such \nas Aedas and SOM. Opening offices worldwide helps build a firm\u2018s \nidentity and differentiate the firm from domestic organizations. Second, \nfor GIC firms, globalization is about accessing talented architects and \nemploying them in the firm\u2018s studio. Offices are usually located in major \nworld cities, and in particular in cities with leading architecture schools, \nto allow talented individuals to be headhunted. These individuals can \nthen be employed on projects throughout the world. Third, and as a \nresult of the first and second points, designing in GICs firms is \u2017at a \ndistance\u2018. Whilst it might be feasible to setup a site office, most of the \narchitects working on a project will be based in an office that is far from \nthe site itself. As a result globalization has led to the phenomena of the \nmobile architect who is constantly travelling to visit projects sites and \nclients. As McNeill (2008) reports, SOM has only three design studios \n(in New York, San Francisco and Chicago) with architects travelling to \nprojects worldwide. Other firms follow similar models. Consequently, \n 10 \nMcNeill (2008) reports that one further factor determining the location of \nthe GIC firms\u2018 offices is flying time, with offices strategically placed to \nensure architects can hop from office to office and office to various sites \nin one reasonable length flight.         \n  \n \nIn contrast, IiIndividual global architects and their studios (table 2), what \nsome call the star architects or \u2017starchitects\u2018 for short because of their \nfetish for iconic buildings that grab the headlines in the architectural but \nalso popular presses thus, thus allowing them develop a position in the \nprofession but also in popular culture that affords them notoriety and \nelite status, are different beasts entirely when compared withto their the \nGIC cousins with and  their multi-office networks but also share some \nsimilaritiescommon traits (see McNeill, 2005b, 2008).  GThey lobal \narchitects like Foster and Koolhaus offer \u2017concepts\u2018 or what Jencks \n(2006) refers to as \u2017iconic architecture\u2018: designs that privilege cutting \nedge built form above the garnering of repeat business or the satisfying \nof clients\u2018 financial concerns.i As Foster and Partners put it, \u2015architecture \nis driven by the pursuit of quality - a belief that our surroundings directly \ninfluence the quality of our lives, whether in the work place, at home or \n 11 \nthe public spaces in between\u2016 \n(http:\/\/www.fosterandpartners.com\/Practice\/1\/Architecture_and_Plannin\ng.aspx). Global architects such as Foster and Koolhaus generally have \nonly one or two design studiosoffices and usually effectively \ncompletedesign all of their projectsbuildings from one location. Hence \ntheir global status is not helped by the existence of a worldwide office \nnetwork but is instead solely reliant on the geographical expansiveness \nof their project portfolio. In this sense, they are even more extreme \nexamples of the designing at a distance discussed in relation to GIC \nfirms. Indeed, the need to design at a distance and the apparent ability \nto work everywhere whilst, in reality, being present in only a few select \nlocations is o ne of the most striking things that both the GIC firms and \nthe global architects have in common.   \n \n \n[Insert table 2 here] \n \nDesigning at a distance: the challenge of situating design \n \n \nFormatted: Font: Italic\n 12 \nOne of the most striking things that both the starchitects and the GIC \nfirmsall global architects do have in common, however, is their apparent \nability to work everywhere whilst, in reality, being present in only a few \nselect locations. Many \u2017starchitects\u2018 only have one office. The largest \nGIC firm in terms of number of offices is Gensler with 28 offices, but 25 \nof these offices are in the USA. The most global firm, Aedas, has offices \nin only ten countries. Consequently all global architects are frequently \ndesigning for and constructing buildings in countries where the firm has \nno presence.  \n \nWe can begin to unpick the way the studios of the starchitectsGIC firms \nand global architects deal with working \u2017at a distance\u2018 from the site \nthrough the work of McNeill (2005b, 2007) who analyses the way stars \nlike Foster remain constantly mobile so as to enable visits to project \nsites and temporary \u2017project offices\u2018. These visits enable insights to be \ngained into contextual influences on a design. In his study of the \ninvolvement of Renzo Piano and Foster in the central business district \nregeneration project in Sydney, McNeill (2007) highlights how Foster\u2018s \nplans had to be \u2017put in their place\u2018 and features excluded in response to \nthe local economics of buildings in Sydney. At the same time though, \n 13 \nPiano\u2018s building was promoted because of its  \u2017Sydney DNA\u2018 but also \nbecause of its distinctiveness when compared to other tall buildings in \nAustralia. This begins to reveal some of the dilemmas global architects \nface in terms ofsuggests that putting global designs in their place is an \nissue all global architects have to deal with. Yet it provides little detail \nabout the range of regulatory \u2017embedding\u2018 or \u2017situating\u2018 forces that \nstarchitects and GIC firmsglobal architects, and GIC firms in particular, \nrespond to when designing a building and how these produce a \nbuilding\u2018s \u2017local\u2018 DNA and lead to a design tailored to the cultural, \neconomic, social and political context of the site.  \n \n \n \n \n \nCase studies of, amongst others, advertising (Faulconbridge, 2006; \nGrabher, 2002) and law professional\/knowledge intensive business \nservices (Jones, 2005) have shownsuggest that following the client \noverseas and opening offices in new markets where new clients exist is \nessential is the only way to provide the the bespoke, \u2017locally\u2018 \n 14 \ncontextualised knowledge-rich adviceproducts and products associated \nwith both business services and cultural industries more broadly. \nAdviceServices and products have to be produced and consumed in the \nsame place because adverts, legal advice or designs need to be \ninformed by \u2017local\u2018, \u2017contextual\u2018 knowledge relating to consumer norms \nand expectations as well as local regulatory standards (Bagchi-Sen and \nSen, 1997; Daniels, 1993). As a result, many of the global advertising \nagencies such as Ogilvy & Mather have in excess of 100 offices in tens \nof countries (Faulconbridge, 2006) whilst global accountants like Price \nWaterhouse Coopers have an even more impressive geographical \nreach (Beaverstock, 1996). Indeed, even the relatively late globalizing \nlaw firms like Clifford Chance have over 30 offices and operate in twenty \nplus countries (Faulconbridge, 2008).  \n \nBut, AaAs already noted, the GIC firms (table 1) and global architects \nsuch as Foster appear to have been unable to develop the same type of \n\u2017localization\u2018 strategy as other professional\/producer service firms.ii The \nlargest GIC firm in terms of number of offices is Gensler with 29 offices, \nbut 24 of these offices are in the USA. The most global firm, Aedas, has \noffices in only ten countries. Yet these firms work in many more \n 15 \ncountries and cities than they have offices. A brief review of the recent \nprojects of leading GIC firms reveals examples including: NBBJ working \nin Singapore (nearest office Shanghai) and Norway (nearest office \nLondon); Skidmore Owings & Merill working in Moscow (nearest office \nLondon) and Dubai (nearest office Hong Kong); and RTKL working in \nAmsterdam (nearest office London) and Abu Dhabi (nearest office \nShanghai).iii Of course, as McNeill (2008) shows, in these cases it is \neven possible that the nearest office may not be the office doing all (or \nany) of the work on a project. Spatial divisions of labour are determined \nby geographies of expertise not proximity to the site.  \n \nIt would seem, then, that standard professional\/knowledge intensive \nbusiness service theory cannot fully explain the globalization activities of \nglbalglobal architects or GIC firms. Thus in any of the cases listed, \ndDesigning at a distance is likely to means buildings beingare conceived \nfar from where they are to be constructed with apparently limited \nconnection to the context in which construction will take place.  This has \nimplications as far as the process of situating designs is concerned, not \nleast because the architects designing a building may have little \nexperience of the cultural, economic, political and social context of the \n 16 \nplace in which a building is to be constructed. As the global production \nnetworks approach shows, designing at a distance without an office in \nsitue at the construction site means architects will, therefore, face the \nchallenge of working across \u2015the continuing unevenness of the spatiality \nof production and consumption, the differentiating role of structural and \ninstitutional conditions at various scales\u2016 (Hess and Yeung, 2006, 1193). \nOr, as Henderson et al. (2002, 446) point out in relation to the operation \nof transnational corporations such as the GIC firms, \u2015They \u2017cut through\u2018 \nstate boundaries in highly differentiated ways, influenced in part by \nregulatory and non-regulatory barriers and local socio-cultural \nconditions\u2016. But what are the implications of designing at a distance for \nthe emplacement of a building design? What affectesaffects does the \nabsence of a \u2017local\u2018 office at the place of construction have on thbe \n\u2017local\u2018 appropriateness of the work of global architects and GIC firms? \n \nThe rest of the paper, therefore, considers in detail both the design-side \n\u2017regulation\u2018 of global architects work \u2013 forces leading to changes to a \nbuilding at the design stages - but also the influence of consumption-\nside \u2017regulation\u2018 \u2013 influences on the building once constructed - and the \nway together these two forces change the design, meaning and identity \n 17 \nof a building. It does this by drawing on insights gained from 49 semi-\nstructured interviews, the majority of which (37) were completed with \narchitects working for GIC firms and in the studios of global architects \nlike Foster. Interviews were conducted in Beijing, London, New York, \nParis, San Francisco and Tokyo, six of the most important cities in terms \nof the work of global architects according to Knox and Taylor (2005). \nInterviews were also completed with professional associations \nrepresenting architects in different countries and with professors of \narchitecture in four different universities in the UK, USA and Japan. All \nexcept two interviews were fully recorded and transcribed and analysed \nusing the principals of grounded theory. \nFor all architects, not just global architects, placing a building in context \nthrough the design process, within the site and the wider city, is a major \nconcern. Grappling with this dilemma is an integral part of all \narchitecture training programmes and involves careful consideration of \nfundamentals such as the orientation of the building and its height in the \ncontext of existing buildings. But,  \n \nDesign-side regulation: the client, code book and embedded \nnetwork relations \n 18 \n \npPerhaps unsurprisingly, those architects interviewed that workingeding \nfor both GIC firms and in the studios of global architects like Foster \nglobal architecture firms arewere not that concerned with by such issues \nandassociated with the process of embedding their buildings in their its \n\u2017local\u2018 context. Instead there is often anthe implicit assumption usually \nexisted that, as one interviewee put it: \n\u2015When somebody hires an architect from New York to design in Dubai \nor Taiwan, at some level the client is looking for something they don\u2018t \nhave and so they are looking for an approach that is different to what is \nthere\u2016 (Design Principal, GIC firm New York). \n \nEchoing this idea, an interviewee working in a startchitect\u2018s London \nstudio of a global architect also suggested \u2015Our work is not really \ncontextual. I\u2018m not saying our work is not specific to the location. It \nprobably is very specific to a location and culture and all that. But I \nwould still think that some kind of international style, we\u2018re not trying to \ndo a French building in France or a German building in Germany. That\u2018s \nexactly what we\u2018re trying to avoid really\u2016. As a result, the office locations \nof global architects are not chosen because of the advantages that \n\u2017being there\u2018 brings in terms of contextualising or constructing a building. \n 19 \nRather, all interviewees agreed that offices are located close to long-\nterm repeat clients (which for GIC firms are usually transnational \ncorporations and property investment companies) and\/or in cities that \nact as magnets for the best architects. So as one managing partner of \nthe London office of a GIC firm commented in relation to the latter factor: \n\u2015The Dubai job, we don\u2018t have an office there. We\u2018re here and one of my team \nmates is based there and they are a representative in the field and the work is \ngetting done here. The fact is that because it\u2018s a people game, you have to \nhave people so the location is almost irrelevant. You just need to find the right \nlocation where the right people want to be at\u2016. \n \nThis is very different to the strategy of advertising and other \nproducer\/professional service firms who, as well as seeking-out talent, \nopen offices because of the need to produce and deliver products in situ \n(Bagchi-Sen and Sen, 1997). Nevertheless, when probed further, \ninterviewees began to reveal that putting buildings in their place is, in \ncertain ways, actually a more significant concern than such comments \nmight first reveal. A short-term site visit was is usually used to deal with \nissues associated with \u2017the site\u2018 and climate. Temporary site offices can \nfurther assist with this task. However, all interviewees agreed that such \noffices are mostly used to deal with the pragmatics of getting the \nFormatted: English (U.K.)\nFormatted: Left, Indent: Left:  0 cm\nFormatted: Left\n 20 \nbuilding constructed rather than with changing itsas a tool for \ncontextualising designs. Indeed, by the time a temporary office is \nestablished construction has often begun or is imminent. In addition \nthough, and often at the fringes of the consciousnesses of interviewees, \nit also became clear that the designs of architects in global firms aare \ncontextualised to varying degrees by three further influences: the client, \nthe rule book and the use of locally embedded network relations tapped \ninto throughout the design and construction process. \n     \n \n \n \nThe client \n \nAs Larson (1993) argues, architects work in a state of heteronomy, \nhaving to defer to the client and their demands rather than working as \nautonomous artisans. For example, for GIC firms in particularall \narchitects client budgets determine the time that can be spent on the \ndesign process whilst the economics of a particular floor plate designs \nand client requests for the maximisation of rentable space underlie the \n 21 \nspatial architecture of the many buildings (McNeill, 2007). Client \ndemands in terms of the use of space within the building and the need \nfor certain types of space (e.g. client reception area; executive dining \nroom) also affect the internal layout and design of buildings built by both \n\u2017stars\u2018 such as Foster and the GIC firms. As a result, whilst many \ninterviewees described the such client defined parameters for design as \na constraint on architectural creativity, the more pragmatic architects \nwere aware ofviewed the client\u2018s importance input into the design \nprocess as beneficialin any project and vital for the development of \n\u2017effective\u2018 designs. As one noted, \u2015I\u2018m usually amazed at how well \ninformed clients and contractors are. Sometimes they are quite smart in \nterms of architecture, so it\u2018s quite surprising actually. I think they \ndeserve more credit than a lot of architects give them really\u2016 (Architect, \nStarchitect\u2018s global architect\u2018s studio London).  \n \nIronically, one outcome of client regulation of designs can be the \nexaggeration of attempts not to contextualise a design. As one \ninterviewee noted, \u2015it is not unusual for us to go into another setting in \nChina and if the building has regional qualities then they will say no we \nhired an American architect to get away from that, we want to show that \n 22 \nwe are international and sophisticated and not backward looking people \nwho are not sophisticated, not part of the global economy\u2016 (Principal, \nGIC firm San Francisco). This kind of attitude does, however, rarely \nextend beyond the building\u2018s fa\u00e7ade. So whilst the client might want a \nbuilding that symbolises \u2017world city\u2018 status (King, 2004), they often want \nan interior that fits with local customs. As a result, clients are seen by \nmost architects as useful players in processes of contextualising, in \nparticular, the interior design of a building.  \n \nThe fact that the client usually has a presence in the city where the new \nbuilding is to be constructed and, as a result, often has knowledge of \nhow consumers behave inside buildings in that city and the norms and \nexpectations of occupiers is means the client\u2018s isthey provide an \nimportant form of input or \u2017regulation\u2018 that helps emplace designs. also \nan important influence on the regulation of global architects\u2018 work. The \nclient is usually used to gain vital insights into the norms and \nexpectations of occupiers. Consequently, oOne architect described as \nfollows the type of changes requested by a Chinese client because of \ntheir insider knowledge into the norms of buildings in China: \n\u2015I don\u2018t think people there have a high expectation of office space, here \nwe enjoy high ceilings, but over there I don\u2018t think they care about the \n 23 \nworkers environment, so when talk about a grand lobby they always \nsay no no we don\u2018t need that, also they always want the lighting to be \nbrighter brighter brighter, in Shanghai it is all about who is the most \nshiniest at night and showing off the building \u2026[also] people here [in \nthe USA] are more equal. In China it is different because all the leaders \nhave their secret elevators, and they need to have their own private \nbathroom. If it is the headquarters the hierarchy is very important, so \neven the entrance separates who you are and where you enter and we \nare told that and we will deign that\u2016 (Principal, GIC firm San Francisco). \n  \nIt is important to recognise, then, that the use of project teams in \narchitecture and the role of the client in the team have an important \naffect on the design process. As studies of organisations that use \nproject teams has shown (Engwall, 2003; Faulconbridge, 2006; \nGrabher, 2002), collaboration between different members of the team \ndefines the creative process, regardless of whether team members are \nlocated in proximity or not. In the case of architecture, the client, who is \noften located at a distance from the architect\u2018s office but in situ where \nthe building is to be constructed, has a vital role in the project team and \nuses their knowledge to begin to put designs in their place despite the \narchitects themselves being far from familiar with the cultural, economic, \nFormatted: Not Highlight\nFormatted: Not Highlight\n 24 \nsocial and political context of the place where the building is to be \nconstructed. This raises interesting questions for theories of the \nglobalization of professional\/knowledge intensive business services in \nrelation to how such organizations \u2017embed\u2018 their operations and deliver \nsituated advice\/products to clients. I return to this point below and in the \nconclusion section of the paper. In terms of work on global aArchitects in \nand GIC firms, these findings suggest that whilst many global architects \noften see the changes made as a result of such client requests as \nsimple adaptations that leave the \u2017concept\u2018 of the building in tactintact, \nchanges are actually highly significant. Indeed. However,, as I discuss \nbelow when I turn to the consumption side influences on building identity \nand use, such client-led changes are highly particularly significant and in \nterms of putting a building in its place in important ways once the \ninhabitants arrive. \n \nCodes and standards \n \nReflecting Imrie\u2018s (2007) suggestion that statutory regulations are a \nconstitutive part of the design process, it is important to look at the \nmultiple layers of code, best practice and performance standards that \n 25 \nglobal architects have to respond to when designing a building. Perhaps \none of the best examples of the implications of such variations for \narchitects of working across political-economic borders is the way the \nregulation effects townscapes and building styles. As Willis (1995) \nshows in relation to New York City, changing regulations relating to the \nheight of buildings, their dimensions and fit within street blocks can be \nused to explain the architectural styles of many of the city\u2018s well-known \nbuildings. For example, the \u2017wedding cake\u2018 design that symbolises the \nNew York skyscraper resulted from the introduction of regulations in \nManhattan that required skyscrapers to have narrower floor plates on \nthe upper floors than at ground level so as to ensure adequate sunlight \nreached surrounding streets. The work of global architects and GIC \nfirms continues to be affected by such city- and country-specific \nregulation which acts as one of the forces which help emplace designs. \nIndeed, as I show below, Fformal statutory regulation (locally and \ntransnationally) and informal political regulatory influence deserve \nparticular attention because of their effects on the work of global \narchitects and GIC firms. \n \nFormatted: Font: Italic\n 26 \nAt one level, a mix of transnational and local formal statutory regulations \n(codes, published standards etc.) influence the design process with local \nstandards often being a reaction against the Anglo-American domination \nof the architectural profession. This mix has important affects on the \ncharacteristics of the buildings global architects produce. Indeed, whilst \nmany global architects tend to believe that they \u2015come from a position of \ncomplexity and find ourselves in a marketplace that is different but likely \nto be less complex and more straight forward\u2016 (Joint Managing Partner, \nGIC firm), regulations need to be considered as a contextualizing force \nbecause of various forms of spatial heterogeneity in their production, \napplication and policing.  \n \nIn terms of formal regulation and codes, tTo a certain extent, architects \ninterviewed suggested that the emergence of transnational standards \nhad begun to override the ability of local regulations to put a building in \nits place. Forms of adaptation are peculiar to each national and even \nsub-national (regional) context.iv So, for example, one architect \ndescribed how \u2015in Dubai and China anyway they tend to use British or \nEuropean norms and so often you find that there is the same set of \nrules. Sometimes it\u2018s harder to work in places like Germany or France \n 27 \nbecause they have their own specific set of rules which have evolved \nover a couple of hundred years I guess. Then you have to be careful \nwhat you\u2018re doing\u2016 (Architect, starchitect\u2018s studio London). In particular, \nwhen global architects work outside of their home-country the changes \nneeded are often quite fundamental and challenge many of the norms of \nUS or UK practice, not least because of the diverse ways UK and US \nregulations are appropriated. AAs one interviewee described this \ngeographical heterogeneous picture:  \n\u2015UK regulations are used quite widely in the Middle East with the \nexception of Saudi where they\u2018ve gone more American.  But in most of \nthe Emirates they will accept either UK or British regulations. And they \ntend to have local regulations where appropriate.  Egypt has probably \ngot a completely different set of building codes but some of them are \nbased on UK and American\u2016 (Architect, GIC firm).  \n \nHowever, whilst at first glance the influence of formal regulation appears \nobvious and global architects might be expected to build using \ntransnational standards or when necessary access building codes for \nthe city\/country they are working in and apply the \u2017scientific\u2018 standards in \ntheir designs, more subtle regulatory forces are at work. OOn occasions \nunintentionally, or even in some cases deliberately when regulators \n 28 \nseek to strengthen local institutional powers, codes that are intended to \nfollow reproduc transnational, usually US or English standards,ed \noutside of their home context mutate as they move across space. \nRather than being \u2017immutable mobiles\u2018 (Latour, 1987), transnational best \npractices used in building codes are, then, dynamic and their unstable. It \nemerged, therefore, that global architects have to changes their \napproach to designing a building to take into account variations in the \napplication of transnational codes that exist between countries, changes \nthat can often have quite fundamental affects on the design of a \nbuilding.  Developing this idea,As  one architect described his views \n(which contradicts the simple interpretation of the architect quoted \nearlier) of regulation in China: \n\u2015China has its own set of codes and they are very proud of it, although \nthere are some pretty strange provisions in that code, when you read it \nit\u2018s almost like a mistranslation of the American code\u2016 (Architect, San \nFrancisco Office of GIC firm).     \n \nIndeed, language itself can be one of the most significant influences on \nmutation. As another San Francisco based architect working for a GIC \nfirm also noted, \u2015the way we see words when translated into English \nmay not mean the same as in Chinese, none of the people in this office \n 29 \nunderstands all the Chinese so the company needs to rely on the project \nmanager to tell them what the Chinese means\u2016. Alongside variations \nresulting from translation,  \n \nSeemingly innocent translations alongside more fundamental and \ndeliberate variations forms of place-specific building also affect the work \nof global architects and GIC firms.in codes can have, therefore As one \ninterviewee noted, this means local norms get incorporated into designs \nmore frequently than might be expected: \n\u2015There are some cultures that expect everyone to be within five meters \nof a window, which means that some of the deep planned spaces that \nwe\u2018ve come up will give you huge economy just won\u2018t work.  These \ndeep plan office spaces work in Europe, most of Europe, not all \nEurope, they work in the UK and it works in America but \u2026 there was a \nsituation in Italy, a kitchen in that situation wouldn\u2018t be acceptable \naccording to their regulations because the kitchen has to have an \noutside window, and to have a window it has to have an outside wall.  \nSo things that you can work with in one area just won\u2018t work in another\u2016 \n(Architect, London office GIC firm).   \nThis mix of local and transnational regulation has important affects on \nthe characteristics of the buildings GIC firms and global architects \n 30 \nproduce with because of the complex forms of. heterogeneitycontinued \ndiversity in formal codes and standards across space ensuring a \ncomplete set of transnational standards for buildings cannot be \ndeveloped.  \n \nAt another level informal political regulation through state officials can \nalso be significant in the design process. Influences might involve, for \nexample, interventions from local planning officials that choose to \npromote a particular design style or level of facilities provision in the \nname of urban boosterism or another legitimating devise. Alternatively \ninformal political influences might be more \u2017covert\u2018 with the idiosyncratic \npreferences of a powerful city mayor, planning chief or other politician \nhaving to be responded to in order to lubricate planning procedures. As \none architect, noted: \n\u2015I think that there have been instances where one could perceive that \nthe officials are overstepping their bounds.  I mean in the best \ncircumstances they are like a kind of patriarch.  So in [place x], which is \na district in [place y], the new mayor, he\u2018s not the mayor, may be he\u2018s \nthe head of the planning department, but the guy with the responsibility \nfor buildings really feels strongly in the importance in architecture, in \nmodern architecture\u2016 (Principal, GIC firm New York). \nFormatted: English (U.K.)\n 31 \n \nThe Suchmore covert forms of political influence are particularly \nsignificant in parts of Asia where guanxi (personal relationships) \ncontinue to play an important role in business (Yeung, 2000). Together \nwith the formal regulatory influences, this leads to buildings designs \nbeing changed in subtle ways before they even leave the drawing board. \nBut how do global architects become aware of such differences if they \nare not designing in situ? It became clear from interviews that regulatory \ndiversity cannot be dealt with simply by accessing the code books for \ndifferent cities\/countries. Instead, global architects have to take account \nof regulatory heterogeneity by incorporating \u2017local\u2018 architects into the \ndesign process.   \n \n \nEmbedded network relations: working with local professionals and the \nconstruction industry \n \nThe final component in the design-side \u2017localization\u2018 process is the role \nof a series of actors who are \u2017on the ground\u2018 and involved in the local \nembedding of the regulatory and construction process. All interviewees \n 32 \nagreed that there comes a point in any project when \u2017local\u2018 knowledge \nbecomes critical, both in relation to design regulation but also the \npragmatics of constructing a new building. One strategy to meet the \nneed for local such knowledge is to employ as many different \nnationalities as possible throughout the firm. All of the GIC firms studied \nhave multiple nationalities in each of their offices. This provides both \nlanguage capabilities and cultural awareness that can be exploited on \noverseas projects. However, having foreign architects in an office is \noften not enough to deal with all of the complexities of working at a \ndistance. In particular, because of the more \u2017subtle\u2018 unwritten social \npractices and norms and the informal regulation described above, \nemploying a suite of local consultants is a strategy all global architecture \nfirms adopt. As one interviewee put it: \n\u2015weWe depend heavily either on the client or consultants who are \nadvisors on what is going on. And we have a case now for Dubai where \nwe tailor something to the specific approach of what they like. And we \nneed to be advised on that. You can\u2018t second guess it really\u2016 (CEO, \nSan Francisco office GIC firm). \n  \n 33 \nConsultants are even needed when intra-national scale variations in \npractice exist;  \u2013 for example when a US GIC firm is working in a US \nstate in which they have no office. As the interviewee went on to note: \n\u2015For example we are doing a 64 storey building with an architect from \n[city x] and they have hired a local waterproofing consultant, a local \nacoustical consultant and they have a local architect because you need \nsomebody with a [state x] license who understands the drawings and \nknows the public process to get things through the regulatory \nauthorities\u2016. \n \nThis highlights, then, another reason for using a consultant: professional \nregulatory hurdles. The \u2017profession\u2018 of architecture, defined by formal \nclosure regimes that restrict the use of the title \u2017architect\u2018 to those with \napproved qualifications (Abbott, 1988; Faulconbridge and Muzio, 2007), \nrequires practitioners to be registered in the country in which they \noperate. This is different to \u2017unbounded professions\u2018 like management \nconsultancy where no \u2017local\u2018 registration is required (Gl\u00fcckler and \nArmbr\u00fcster, 2003). As most of the architects working for global firms are \nonly registered in a few US states or in the UK, it is necessary to employ \na locally registered architect from an established local firm. This \narchitect is then responsible for submitting the final plans \u2013 the \n 34 \nconstruction documents - to regulators for approval. As one interviewee \ndescribed this process:     \n\u2015foreign architects are not allowed by law to do work in China, they can \ndo work but they cant produce the working documents and so the local \ndesigner does that, so it means that you draw on their title block and \nthey turn it in. So they don\u2018t actually do that much work, but the idea is \nto create a partnership and elevate the knowledge base in China\u2016 \n(Architect, San Francisco office GIC firm). \n \nAgain, at first glance, as the interviewee hints, the affect of local \ncontractors on the design of a building are slight. Most of the design \nwork and drawings are produced by the global firm with the local \narchitect adapting them to meet local requirements. However, the \nmutations that occur as local architects make the final adaptations can \nresult in fundamental changes that get exaggerated once the building\u2018s \ninhabitants arrive (see below). As one interviewee noted:  \n\u2015we set criteria for a project and then a lot of delineation is done by \nothers. Same in Shanghai, they want the initial design [and] one of our \nguys in Shanghai got into trouble because the contractors didn\u2018t want \nhim on the site anymore, they were just so used to changing things as \nthey go\u2016 (Associate Architect, GIC firm\u2018s New York office). \n 35 \n \n \n \nThis also highlights, then,In addition, the role of tThe firms actually \nconstructing the building and the way they also play an important role in \nputting a building in itsalso have a similar effect on a building place. \nWhilst there are now many global construction firms, the workers they \nemploy are usually locals. As a result, only if there is a skilled local \nworkforce familiar with US or UK building principles is it possible, able to \nconstruct the building in the way the architect envisages, is it possible to \noperate in the same was as in the firm\u2018s home-country. Often this again \nleads to subtle adaptations as skill sets, or even materials, are \nunavailable. As one interviewee noted about the concerns this creates \nfor global architects: \n\u2015the workmanship is not so good; the design may not involve so many \nspecialist consultants like in western countries.  Sometimes the finish is \npretty rough or they don\u2018t have the money, the budget to do nice \nthings\u2026 the most challenging task here because as said, workmanship, \neverything is still a developing country and our services here are still \nnot full services and the industry is not organized like in the western \n 36 \ncountries.  So sometime you feel you cannot control everything\u2016 \n(Managing Partner, GIC firm Beijing). \n \nChanges that result from the work of local contractors, when combined \nwith the changes made to compensate for client requests and changes \nsuggested by \u2017local\u2018 architects integrated into the project team to help \naddress geographical variations in code requirements, suggest, then, \nthat global firms are actually operating as more intensely embedded and \nvarious regulated organizations than it appears at first glance. Returning \nto the ideas about project teams introduced above, this suggests that \nthe state of heteronomy (Larson, 1993) in which global architects work \nin when operating as part of a project team in which the client, \nengineers, architects \u2017local\u2018 to the site and construction professionals all \nhave an influence on designsare all involved, results in buildings being \nput in their place in subtle ways. Whilst representatives of the global \narchitecture firm might be numerically dominant in the project team and \nhave most power, the input of these other actors involved in the team \nstill makes important interventions in the design process, interventions \nthat situates the building and helps begin to put it in its place.  In many \nways this emphasizes the argument of Hess (2004) that, as a socio-\neconomic process, embeddedness is notn\u2018t about spatial fixity or \n 37 \nlocatedness but is about enrollment in various networks of \nassociationthat have local and transnational dimensions. In the work of \nglobal architecture firms, projects teams, are then, made up of those \ndesigning at a distance but also actors that are in situ and have in-depth \nknowledge relevant to the place where a building is constructed. This \nembeds the work of apparently disembodieddisembedded global firms. \nAs the data analysed above shows, Hence global architecture firms, \nwhilst not being present in the places that they design buildings for, are \naffected by a range of forces that subtly embed their work in the social, \ncultural, economic and political dynamics fabrics of the locale. Whilst the \nresult is adaptation, rather than a fundamental rethinking of design, the \nconsequences can, nonetheless, be significant. Indeed, the affects of \nthe changes that occur in the design-side adaptation process are even \nmore significant when life is breathed into the structure building by the \nentrance of its occupants.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 38 \n \nConsumption-side regulation: hybrid productions of social life \n \n \nSocial practice and the utilization of space \n \nAs a number of studies have documented (Bunnell, 1999; Imrie, 2003; \nJacobs, 2006; Lees, 2001; Shove, 1991), the identity of a building is as \nmuch a result of the way spaces are appropriated by their the building\u2018s \ninhabitants as it is the result of the \u2017hand\u2018 of the architect. As Imrie \n(2003, 51) points out, architects often do not recognise this and miss the \nfact that buildings are \u2015\u2018there as part of us\u2018, or as material matter that is \nbeing constantly produced in the course of its (bodily) use\u2016. The \ninhabitants of buildings are, therefore, often viewed by architects as little \nmore than what Shove (1991, 10) calls \u2017Letraset zombies\u2018, objects \nwhose dimensions (average height etc.) need to be accommodated in \nplans. These zombies are assumed to act rationally, \u2015some satisfied, \nsome miserable, but all propelled through the built environment, \ninvoluntarily pushed this way or that by someone else\u2018s decisions\u2016. In \nreality though, \u2015the nature of an individual\u2018s role as a user depends on \n 39 \nhis\/her position within the social structure of, in this case, the employing \norganisation\u2016. Hence this \u2015reminds us of the social positioning of \nindividuals and of the relations of power embodied in and recreated by \nbuildings\u2016 (Shove, 1991, 11).  \n \nIndeed, asAs wWork on theories of social practice s(Reckwitz, 2002), \nalso reinforces the idea that there is an intimate relationship between \npeoples\u2018 routinised behaviour and understanding of the world and the \nmaterial landscape they inhabit. Because sSocial practices, which, can \nbe place-specific and are as routinised everyday behaviours based on \nforms of knowledge and competency, that are constructed over time, \nand, and, theythusaffect in geographically heterogeneous waysm, in \nways that varies between places,m how individuals interact with their \nbuilt environment in a way that varies between countries. As a result, \ninhabitants of the buildings designed by global architects often engage \nin \u2017unscripted\u2018 actions that reflect local social practice but challenge the \ndesigner\u2018s conceptualisation of a building and the way it should be used \n(Ingram et al., 2008). Consequently, as Lees (2001, 56) puts it, \u2015if we \nare to concern ourselves with the inhabitation of architectural space as \nmuch as its signification, then we must engage practically and actively \n 40 \nwith the situated and everyday practices through which built \nenvironments are used\u2016 (see also Bryden, 2004).  \n \nOccupants and their actions also affect a building\u2018s identity. So seeing \n\u2015architecture as a social product, as the spatial configuration of the built \nenvironment incorporating economic, political, and ideological \ndimensions\u2016 (Goss, 1988, 394) is vital. For example, Bunnell (1999) \nshows that the identity of the Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia is as \nmuch a result of the supposed on-goings within the towers (which were \nrumoured to house an office of the prime minister) as their physical \nstructure, thus bringing into question the extent to which architects\u2018 \nstrategies alone put designs in their place. For Jacobs (2006) such an \napproach can be enhanced by drawing on work from science and \ntechnology studies and actor-network theory so as to understand the \nway buildings \u2017move\u2018 across space as an idea and identity. Jacobs \ntherefore argues that \u2015Diffusionist models of explanation have a \nrelatively stable thing moving through space and time by the way of \nsocial effort. Translation, in contrast, brings into view not only the work \nrequired to a thinkfor a thing to reach one position from another, but also \nthe multiplicity of add-ons that contribute, often in unpredictable and \nFormatted: Not Highlight\n 41 \nvarying ways, to transportation\u2016 (Jacobs, 2006, 13). All of the above \nleads to what King (2004) calls a post-colonial perspective on the built \nenvironment that allows a better appreciation ofsuggests, then, that \nwhilst the work of the global architect and GIC firms. A post-colonial \nperspective suggest that,  the work of global architects and GIC firms \nmight be being assumed to lead to cultural homogeneity, in reality their \nwork ismight be place- specific not only because of design-side \nstrategies that might alter the material structure of the building but also \nbecause of the way materiality, social structures and practices interact \n\u2017on the ground\u2018in situ. Two dimensions of this interaction are outlined \nbelow. \n \n \nSocial practice and the use of global designs \n \nIt became clear from interviews with architects that .tThe autonomous, \nhybrid lives of buildings, as well as the architects hand and imagination, \nare critical parts, then, of the inter-related design- and consumption-side \nprocess that put the work of global architects in itsbuildings in their \nplace. So, at its most simplistic, inability or unwillingness to use a \nFormatted: Font: Italic\n 42 \nbuilding in the way it was designed can transform its meaning. The \nvignette provided by one interviewee describes the potential impacts of \nthis: \n\u2015I spend a lot of time in China and my experience there is that even the \nmaintenance issues are enormous, I\u2018ve been in fairly new 12 story \napartment buildings where half the toilets aren\u2018t working because there \nis nobody who knows how to fix them, there is no understanding that \nwhat we really need to do in this town is to set up a trade school that \nlearns people to fix toilets, air conditioning, etc.\u2016 (Professor, \nArchitecture School, San Francisco). \n \nThis is an extreme example of what Ingram et al. (2007) describe as the \nfailure of scripting: when objects and technical systems fail because \ndesigners do not consider the hybrid construction of an object and the \nway it only \u2017works\u2018 when social norms, capabilities and knowledges exist \nthat support it. The use and, as I show below, the identity of a buildings, \ntherefore, get produced as a result of the powerful situated \nunderstandings and social practices of its inhabitants, not just as a result \nof the vision of the architect. Consequently, Aas one architect \nacknowledged, \u2015How do people use it, how do they navigate, how do \nthey arrive, what do they do while they are there? And they are functions \nFormatted: English (U.K.)\n 43 \nof cultural difference that are hard to accomodateaccommodate\u2016 \n(Architect, starchitect\u2018s global architect\u2018s studio, London). \n \nOf course, if powerful enough, a design might lead to changes in \nunderstandings and practices themselves. The latter state of affairsThis \nis the architect\u2018s ultimate ambition. However, as the following vignette \nstory told byfrom one interviewee illustrates, in reality such scripting of \nbehaviours often failscannot be assumed and is less common that might \nbe hoped for: \n\u2015this one school, it [a design criteria] was how convenient for public \ntransport and the question was put down with a view to, it should be \nconvenient.  And the headmaster said it\u2018s too convenient. He\u2018d got \nchildren with learning difficulties and what the problem is actually \nkeeping them at school, there\u2018s a bus outside and they are all saying, \noh we\u2018ll go and catch that and they are off.  So you know, what \nsomeone said, is a way of saying yes this is a good design because it\u2018s \nconvenient for public transport but the headmaster said it was a bad \ndesign because it\u2018s too convenient for public transport\u2016 (Architect, GIC \nsupport firm). \n \n 44 \nThe inhabitants of the buildings designed by global architects are not, \nthen, \u2017Letraset zombies\u2018 (Shove, 1991). Instead, bu they aret active \nproducers of the building. Consequently, and drawing ons Law (2002), \nshows,  it seems that designersglobal architects and GIC firms always \ndeal with the absent presence \u2013 those influences on designs that are not \nobvious but nevertheless profoundly affect the way a final materialtheir \nproducts \u2013 buildings - performs and isare appropriated. Therefore, we \nneed to \u2015avoid the flattening effect of imagining that there is on the one \nhand a great designer, a heterogeneous engineer, and on the other a \nset of materially heterogeneous bits and pieces. Instead, we need to \nhold onto the idea that the agent \u2013 the \u2017actor\u2018 of the actor-network \u2013 is \nan agent, a centre, a planner, a designer, only to the extent that matters \nare also decentered, unplanned, undesignedundesigned\u2016 (Law, 2002, \n136). This is particularlyalso important in understanding how a building\u2018s \nsituated identity emerges. \n \n \nSocial practice and the situated identity of built forms \n \n 45 \nThe hybrid production of meaning by absent presences in the design \nprocess can be particularly significant when local peculiarities give a \nbuilding an unexpected local identity. Debates about the work of global \narchitecture firms and other global design and consumption related \nproducer and professional services would seem, then, to need to move \nbeyond simple examinations of whether a design fits with the local \nvernacular or context. Exploring how social practice makes identity is \ninstead imperative. As one interviewee put it: \n\u2015what I\u2018m worried about with globalisationglobalization is that in a way it \ndehumanizes architecture and I think the human being, the inhabitant, \nthe occupants, the clients, the users, whatever they want to call them, \nare actually kind of very important. And all you have to do is look back \nto the modern movement and architects were virtually arrogant enough \nto think that there was such things as global style.  You could transpose \nwhatever you did in Finland to Chicago, from Chicago to Paris and \nParis to Rome and from Rome to India\u2026it clearly failed because \narchitects saw themselves not only as engineers, spatial engineers but \nalso kind of social engineers\u2016 (Professor of Architecture, London). \n \nFollowing Imrie (2003) and Shove (1991), it is possible to argue, \ntherefore, that architects but also academics exploring the identity of \n 46 \n\u2017iconic\u2018 and tall buildings are often also too quick to forget the role of the \ninhabitant and their socially complex form in the production of a \nbuilding\u2018s identity and meaning. The following vignette from an \ninterviewee further exemplifies why such considerations are so \nimportant: \n\u2015what was interesting was that we proposed a greenish glass on it [the \nnew building] and when you looked at the building in plans the client \nsaid that it looked like a fish and he also said that it looked like it was \nfacing towards the East. And in terms of Chinese symbology a fish is \nunderstood as symbol of prosperity and facing the East was also seen \nas important, so their reading was important as it gave a value that \nwasn\u2018t intended\u2016 (Design Director, New York office, GIC firm).  \n \nOf course, the building described in the vignette may well have a \ndistinctly \u2017world city\u2018 appearance. Yet the story behind itsof the building\u2018s \nidentity indicates that urban forms are understood by those who interact \nwith them on a day-to-day basis in ways that are very differently to those \nof distant onlookers. The hybrid production of meaning by absent \npresences in the design process is, then, particularly significant when \nlocal peculiarities give a building an unexpected local identity. Debates \nabout the work of global architecture firms and other global design and \n 47 \nconsumption related producer and professional services would seem, \ntherefore, to need to move beyond simple examinations of whether a \ndesign fits with the local vernacular or context. Exploring how social \npractice and situated knowledges, competanciescompetencies and \nlogics makes identity is instead imperative and opens up a series of \nquestions about how the affects of globalization on the products of \ncultural industries, such as architecture, can be better theorized so as to \nrecognize the many ways that buildings, adverts or any other cultural \nproduct gains local identity and meaning. As the discussion here shows, \nthis is not simply about designing-in local sensitivities to a product. \nEmplacing a design but  also involves understanding the effects of \nconsumption on the product. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nIt is not uncommon to hear debates about the homogenization of design \nand the destruction of vernacular by the worldwide exporting of \nAmerican architecture by global architecture firms. But as Cody (2003), \nKing (2004) and other have suggested, understanding the affects of the \n 48 \nglobalization of architects and architecture firms requires more nuanced \ntheorizations of the hybrid social lives of buildings. In this paper I have \nadopted such an approach and begun to unpack the work of GIC firms \nand global architects and consider the ways their buildings get \u2017put in \ntheir place\u2018 by design-side and consumption-side regulation by actors \nincluding clients, codes and standards, local collaborators and building \noccupants. These actors mean the global architect\u2018s work is subtly \nadapted and emplaced, despite the fact that practitioners are design \ndesigning at a distance and moving designs across space.  \n \nIn terms of debates about regulation, the paper highlights the \nimportance of recognizing both codified regulatory influences on \narchitectural design (rule books, performance standards etc.) but also \nother forms of socio-technical regulation (i.e. the multiple parties \ninvolved in the design process, and social practice and its their influence \non the use and identity of built forms). More broadly, the paper\u2018s findings \nalso talk to two different but equally significant theoretical debates in \neconomic and urban geography.  \n \n 49 \nFirst, the now extensive literature on the transnational corporation and \ntheir embeddedness in host-country contexts can be enriched by the \nfindings of the paper (Dicken et al. 2001; Henderson et al. 2002; Hess, \n2004). In particular, the findings presented here suggest that global \narchitecture firms cannot be fully understood through existing ideas \nadvanced in work on services (Daniels, 1993; Bagchi-Sen and Sen, \n1997) and professional services in particular (Beaverstock et al., 1999; \nFaulconbridge, 2008; Jones, 2005). Global architecture firms not only \nprosper by selling non-local designs but also manage to produce from a \ndistance designs that are \u2017in their place\u2018. The intermingling of design-\nside influences but also consumption-side influences on how buildings \nare constructed and made sense of is central to this \u2017embedding\u2018 \nprocess. Thus the received wisdom that transnational corporations \nlocalize their services through embedded in situ network operations that \nallow access to \u2017local\u2018 knowledge which informs that adaptation to of \nproducts and services through physical presence seems to be in need of \nembellishment and further consideration.  \n \nGlobal architecture firms may well be unique and one-off cases. But it is \nequally possible that, as has been shown here in relation to global \n 50 \narchitecture firms, other  other design-related firms also experience the \nsimilar processes of \u2017localization\u2018 described in this paper because, like in \narchitecture, of the way members of the project design team are \nembedded in the cultural, economic, social and political context of the \nplace in which the product is to be consumed. Whilst existing studies \nhave highlighted the role of spatially distributed teams in innovation \n(Engwall, 2003; Faulconbridge, 2006; Grabher, 2002), these studies \nhave not identified the role of such teams in the production and delivery \nof \u2017localized\u2018 services and cultural products, such as buildings or \nadverts, that are \u2017in place\u2018. It would, therefore, seem worthwhile further \ninvestigating the use of the team as a strategy for delivering \ncontextualized professional\/knowledge intensive business services \nwithout the establishment of offices \u2017in situ\u2018 and closein proximity to the \nclient.  \n \nSecond, the paper also develops existing work on the social production \nof architectural forms (Bunnell, 1999; Goss, 1988; Jacobs, 2006; Lees, \n2001; Knox, 1987). In particular it uses existing work inspired by science \nand technology studies as well as cultural geography to explore the \nactivities of global architects and the social production of their work. The \nFormatted: Font: Italic\n 51 \nintroduction use of work on social practice (Ingram et al., 2007; \nReckwitz, 2002) to in these debates is particularly significant as it offers \na complementary theoretical perspective that can be used to further \nunderstand the hybrid lives of built forms, or what to paraphrase Jacobs \n(2006, 11) could be called \u2017the field of relations that hold buildings \ntogether\u2018. Lees (2001) begins to develops this line of thinking and here I \nhave further shown how everyday routinised behaviours that exist in the \ncontext of influential social structures and power relations affect both \nhow a building and its facilities are used but also the identity of a \nbuilding. Indeed, this would seem one of theanother important future \navenues for research identified by the paper. The now maturing body of \nwork on theories of social practice deserves better interrogation into  the \ncontext of discussions about the geography of architecture, something \nbegun here but in need of a more extended discussionin particular in the \ncontext of global architecture firms and transnational standards relating \nto building design and sustainability. It would seem worthwhile to further \nconsider how the \u2017performance\u2018 of building designs and the hybrid \nprocess that gives meaning to designs leads to architectural approaches \nbeing rendered appropriate and inappropriate in different contexts. This \nmight have impacts on both the social appropriateness of a design (e.g. \n 52 \nwhether a building is liked and found to be well-designed by users) but \nalso the technical performance of a building (e.g. whether it is financially \nsuccessful in terms of occupancy levels and use of electricity and \nheating), all of which concerns both architects but also academics.      \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe ideas and data presented in this paper were developed as part of a \nBritish Academy funded research project SG-43996.
