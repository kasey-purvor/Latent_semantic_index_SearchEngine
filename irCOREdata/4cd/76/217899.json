Why else would the public be so \u201ccrazy\u201d\n(p. 69) as to disagree with economics \u201cexperts\u201d? His only\nactual argument for mass economic irrationality, however,\nis that it can provide an RCT explanation of nonrandom\nmass opinion. He gives no reason to believe that rational\nirrationality \u201cexists\u201d\u2014except as a solution to a problem in\nthe theory of rational choice.\nHowever, the fact that Caplan fails to prove that ratio-\nnal irrationality exists in the real world does not mean that\nthere is nothing in the real world to be explained. Emo-\ntion and ideology, not to mention error, are plentiful in\npolitics, amply deserving the attention he pays them. But\nto explain them as rational choices, he has to assign them\nto the mass level, where they can be seen as corollaries of\nthe average voter\u2019s insignificance.\nCaplan references, but does not seem to have under-\nstood, Philip Converse\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of Belief Systems\nin Mass Publics\u201d (David E. Apter, ed., Ideology and Dis-\ncontent, 1964), which showed that ideology tends to be\nthe province of the well-informed few, not the ignorant\nmasses. More recent political-psychology literature on\n\u201cmotivated reasoning\u201d suggests that people cling dogmat-\nically to their beliefs\u2014by using their knowledge to\nfend off discrepant information. Thus, \u201cideological\nconstraint\u201d would be likelier among relatively knowledge-\nable elites than relatively ignorant masses\u2014as Converse\nfound.\nElite dogmatism, however, fits uncomfortably with RCT.\nThe politically knowledgeable few would tend to have\ngreater incentives than typical voters to avoid stubbornly\nclinging to what might be mistaken ideas, because all\nthings being equal, the politically knowledgeable would\nlikelier be politicians, bureaucrats, political activists,\nterrorists\u2014even economists or political scientists\u2014who\ninfluence politics much more than average voters do.\nCaplan would predict that influential elites are less ideo-\nlogical than average voters, yet at least with knowledge-\nable elites, the opposite holds. They seem inclined toward\ndogmatism regardless of the incentive to keep an open\nmind (cf. Tetlock, Expert Political Judgment, 2006).\nBut then, the world they are trying to understand is\ncomplicated. In confronting complexity, people err inad-\nvertently (and nonrandomly, for cognitive and cultural\nreasons): not by choice, but by accident. And the more\nmisleading information people inadvertently accumulate,\nthe easier it is to fend off discrepant information. Here,\ndogmatism is unintentional. In RCT, though, everything\u2014\neven \u201cirrationality\u201d\u2014is intentional. Extracting from this\nhyper-rationalism a plausible theory of mistake may sim-\nply be impossible.\nThese days, understanding political error and dogma is\nespecially crucial. But judging from The Myth of the Ratio-\nnal Voter, that objective might best be advanced by leaving\nRCT behind\u2014no matter how dogmatically economists\ncling to this particular error.\nCooperation Without Trust?

Woodruff, London School of Economics and\nPolitical Science\nThe two books under review differ sharply on the fruit-\nfulness of rational choice theory. Karen Cook, Russell Har-\ndin, and Margaret Levi posit that even trust is best\nunderstood as a product of rational, materialist calcula-\ntions. On their \u201cencapsulated interest\u201d view, trust \u201cexists\nwhen one party to [a] relation believes the other party has\nincentive to act in his or her interest or to take his or her\ninterests to heart\u201d (p. 2). But can incentives truly whisper\nto the heart? Michael Taylor decries the baleful conse-\nquences, both intellectual and practical, that stem from\nassimilating all reasoned decision making to the numeri-\ncal weighing of material incentives and ignoring the role\nof heartfelt personal and moral commitments.\nCook, Hardin, and Levi find it most useful to define\ntrust as resting not only on incentives but specifically on\nthose incentives arising from the desire for repeated per-\nsonal interactions. The major contention of their book is\nthat trust in this sense can play only a limited role in\nsustaining cooperation in contemporary mass societies.\nEven allowing for some transitivity of trust across social\nnetworks, the individual in a contemporary society must\ncooperate with multitudes of people for whom a future of\nprospective dealings with the individual or that person\u2019s\ntrusted associates casts no shadow. Various substitutes for\ntrust are thus required if cooperation is to proceed. The\nauthors consider many examples, among them fictive kin-\nship relations employed by Kenyan pastoralists, associa-\ntions that license professionals such as doctors or lawyers,\nand state organs of coercion and regulation.\nThe sheer variety of these topics is a problem. The ter-\nrain of alternatives to trust is vast. Even a selective survey\nof this terrain yields conclusions of such extreme general-\nity as to be almost devoid of content. Doubtless the authors\nare on safe ground in stating that \u201cdistrust and lack of\ntrust are more likely than trust . . . to motivate us to create\nthe institutions that allow us to cooperate with each other\nand treat each other as trustworthy\u201d (p. 186). However,\nthis verity offers little guidance into launching an investi-\ngation of concrete empirical situations.\nAs a result, reading the book\u2019s many short treatments of\nthe dilemmas of cooperation in various realms is a frus-\ntrating experience: They fail to cumulate and are generally\ntoo abbreviated to be satisfactory on their own terms. For\ninstance, in illustrating how large-scale social transitions\ndestabilize established structures of cooperation, the authors\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nMarch 2008 | Vol. 6\/No. 1 161\ncontend that the U.S. Civil War eliminated \u201c[t]raditional\npatterns of reciprocity,\u201d and \u201cslaves once entrusted with\nchildren and valued property became subjects of distrust\nand fear\u201d (p. 169). Whatever its (dubious) empirical mer-\nits, the idea that slavery enabled reciprocity and trust\nbetween owners and owned flatly contradicts the authors\u2019\nown earlier analysis of how power asymmetries under-\nmine trust.\nWhile this puzzling vision of slavery serves just a minus-\ncule expository role in the text, the failure to deal consis-\ntently with the implications of expressed theoretical views\nis a broader problem. Cook, Hardin, and Levi argue that\nactors are always interrogating the contours of counter-\nparties\u2019 interests, always looking forward, always assessing\nwhether those in whom they place trust will continue to\nface a set of incentives prompting trustworthy behavior.\nTrust is accordingly specific and situational. But another\ncore argument seems to belie the point.The authors repeat-\nedly claim that enforcement-backed formal institutions\nare an important precursor to trust, \u201cencourag[ing] citi-\nzens to take the small risks with others that facilitate their\nlearning who is reliable, even trustworthy, and how to\ndistinguish the reliable from those who are not\u201d(p. 159).\nHowever, on an incentive-based view, this argument is\nincoherent: Loaning you a ballpoint pen gives me no infor-\nmation on whether I could expect return of a loan of a\nmillion dollars, the incentive to abscond with which is of\nan entirely different magnitude.The whole small-risks argu-\nment makes sense only if there are fundamentally trust-\nworthy and untrustworthy people whose type can be\ndetected on the basis of their past record. Elsewhere,\nthough, highlighting such backward-looking judgments\nis explicitly criticized.\nEven the materialist microfoundations that ground the\nwhole approach are not carried through consistently. The\nauthors accept that humans are psychologically compli-\ncated creatures and not incentive-calculating automata.\nWe are given to \u201ccognitive paranoia\u201d (p. 50), which can\nprompt blanket hostility to those outside our trusted\ngroup, or provoke us to sabotage the goals of overvigilant\nemployers. We often ignore information that contradicts\nour prior convictions. Yet people \u201cdriven primarily by\nvalues rather than by interests\u201d would be \u201can odd breed\nof human\u201d (p. 115). There is no explanation given for\nwhy paranoia and bias are less odd than moral values.\nIndeed, the authors even concede that trustworthy behav-\nior may sometimes be motivated by moral commitment\nor personal disposition.\nDespite its intellectual amorphousness, Cooperation\nWithout Trust offers readers some rewards. There are vig-\norous and convincing discussions of the limitations of legal\nregulation and of the conflicts of interest behind the U.S.\ncorporate scandals of the early 2000s. Stimulating discus-\nsions on the limitations of overly general views of trust\nand a related reformulation of \u201csocial capital\u201d are also\nworthy of attention. However, failures of synthesis and\nconsistency render the whole less than the sum of its parts.\nWhile those interested in the topic will wish to sample\nthis volume, teachers of the \u201cencapsulated interest\u201d theory\nwould do better to employ Hardin\u2019s more instructionally\nfocused treatment (see his Trust, 2006).\nTaylor\u2019s book is an impassioned attack on \u201cRational\nChoice\u201d theory\u2014capitalized to emphasize what he sees as\nunfortunate capture of the language of rationality by a\nviewpoint that actually rejects its importance. A truly ratio-\nnal choice, on Taylor\u2019s view, is a reasoned one, in which\nwe reflect upon the implications of our foundational com-\nmitments and whether they must override desires. And\nthis is often how we do make decisions. When we are\ndeeply connected to people, to our self-identification as\nmoral, or to places\u2014as, say, some Native Americans are\nto some traditional fishing grounds\u2014we are not willing\nto sacrifice this connection even to satisfy desires that we\nwould act on in other circumstances. To conceive of the\nloss of such connections as a negative number is to imply\nthat there is some positive number that could cancel it,\nsuch that \u201canyone is compensable for any loss\u201d (p. 48).\nThus, theorists who take \u201cRational Choice\u201d to be an arith-\nmetic operation in which numerical pros and cons are\nmechanically totaled are, in practice, advocates of \u201can\nideology\u2014perhaps the ideology\u2014of disconnection, of dis-\nintegration\u201d (p. 87), according to which every connection\nhas its price. The ideology takes especially destructive form\nin cost\u2013benefit analyses, which, asTaylor relates, have been\nused to justify horrible depredations against aboriginal\npopulations and the natural environment.\nOne should not get the impression that Taylor is offer-\ning a solely normative argument. He draws on substantial\nempirical support as well to ground his understanding of\nhuman beings as regularly disdaining incentives in favor\nof the commitment to their moral selves, to their habitats,\nto fair reciprocity, and to communities. His view helps\nexplain why experimental game theory finds that people\ncooperate much more often than payoff matrices would\npredict. He also gives a convincing explanation of research\nthat demonstrates how positively employees react to being\ntreated with trust rather than suspicion. (Dealing with\nsome of the same research, Cook, Hardin, and Levi have a\nmuch harder time fitting it into their framework.)\nWith its clear and lively writing, intelligent argumen-\ntation, and forceful point of view, Rationality and the Ide-\nology of Disconnection should be an excellent conversation\nstarter in a seminar setting. Controversy may center on\nwhether Taylor is justified in directing so much fire at\nrational choice theory. Critiques of disconnection, of a\nsystem with, as Marx famously put it in his 1848 Com-\nmunist Manifesto, \u201cno other nexus between people than\nnaked self-interest, than callous \u2018cash payment\u2019\u201d well pre-\ndate the articulation of neoclassical economics. Taylor\u2019s\nvivid portrait of the effects of markets on community and\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nBook Reviews | Political Theory\n162 Perspectives on Politics\nthe environment resonates with this tradition, which of\ncourse has made critical use of incentive-based analyses.\nThe author himself suggests that rational choice theory is\nmore legitimation than motivation for the sort of actions\nhe decries, and that other intellectual justifications have\nbeen offered in the past.\nIn any event, the idea that there are no irremediable\nlosses is not a necessary implication of portraying choice\nas driven by incentives\u2014one can either employ ranked\nrather than numeric payoffs, or assign a negative payoff so\nlarge that it cannot be compensated by anything possible\nin a particular game. Nor are the interpersonal compari-\nsons of utility involved in cost\u2013benefit analysis sanctioned\nby rational choice theory. The author is aware of these\npoints, but his responses are not entirely satisfactory.\nTaylor\u2019s positive intellectual program of offering alter-\nnative microfoundations is fully developed, but his posi-\ntive political program is less so. His rejection of cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis, as incompatible with the importance of\nregarding certain things as invaluable, risks degenerating\ninto an assertion that there can be politics without hard\nchoices. Deliberation may make people \u201cmore likely to\nconsider what ought to be done for the common good\u201d\n(p. 79) but the oft-posed question of how to deal with\ndissent over the common good is not addressed. And what\nis there to do when what is invaluable to me is incompat-\nible with what is invaluable to you? One does not have to\nsupport a soulless technocracy to worry that exalting the\nmoral significance of what we consider unique and\nirreplaceable could have pernicious effects of its own.\nTaylor attacks rational choice theory with the fervor of\nan apostate. As he notes, he was previously a prominent\npractitioner of the approach himself. When confronted\nwith evidence that people were far more willing to disre-\ngard incentives than he had previously held, he reports,\nhis initial inclination was to argue that a numerically under-\nstood rationality still ruled human acts, but its reign might\nbe limited to situations of relatively high stakes. In this\nbook he abandons even this retreat, in light of the evi-\ndence he presents that quite massive incentives have often\nproved impotent against convictions. On the other hand,\nTaylor makes clear that he accepts that incentives do some-\ntimes guide our acts. Indeed, it would be surprising if they\ndid not, given the many institutions (including the\ncooperation-sustaining ones described by Cook, Hardin,\nand Levi) that are engineered precisely to steer human\nbehavior through the manipulation of incentives. For their\npart, these authors note that materialist considerations are\nnot the only foundation of trust. These mutual conces-\nsions suggest that to the extent the battle over rational\nchoice theory is a search for the ultimately \u201ccorrect\u201d micro-\nfoundations of action, it is futile. Conviction and cupidity\nwill both have their day, and we would all benefit from\nregarding them as mechanisms (see Jon Elster, \u201cA Plea for\nMechanisms,\u201d in P. Hedstr\u00f6m and R. Swedberg eds., Social\nMechanisms: An Analytical Approach to Social Theory, 1998,\npp. 45\u201373), rather than final answers about human nature.\nPunishment and Political Order. By Keally McBride.\nAnn Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2007. 194p. $55.00 cloth,\n$19.95 paper.\nDOI: 10.1017\/S1537592708080171\n\u2014 Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn, Whitman College\nWhat part does punishment play in the constitution of\npolitical order, and under what circumstances does pun-\nishment reinforce or undermine that order? In recent\ndecades, suggests Keally McBride, this question has too\noften been ceded by students of political science to soci-\nologists, legal scholars, and criminologists. In this discern-\ning collection of essays, McBride seeks to reclaim this turf\nby asking, first, how certain pathbreaking texts have\nresponded to the dilemmas generated when political orders,\nreal or imagined, inflict suffering in response to misdeeds\nand, second, how we might make, specifically, political\nsense of controversies engendered by contemporary prac-\ntices of punishment, especially but not exclusively in the\nUnited States.\nThe volume\u2019s opening essays offer intriguing juxtaposi-\ntions of otherwise familiar texts. The first plays Thomas\nMore\u2019s Utopia against Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cIn the Penal Colony\u201d\nin order to show how the traveler\u2019s tale, related in each,\nencourages readers to find strange those penal practices\notherwise considered unexceptional, while the second essay\nopposes the inscrutable suffering endured by Job, as\nrecounted in the Hebrew Bible, to the rationalist account\nof punishment offered by Hobbes in his Leviathan. Antici-\npating a theme that recurs throughout the book, McBride\nconcludes the latter essay by arguing that any effort to\nredeem deliberately imposed political suffering via a purely\nsecular logic is in perpetual need of shoring up, which\nexplains why Hobbes insisted that the sovereign be con-\nsidered a \u201cmortal god.\u201d Much the same theme is key to\nthe third essay\u2019s discussion of punishment in relation to\nthe current debate about the contemporary status of state\nsovereignty. Following the obligatory review of Carl\nSchmitt, Giorgio Agamben, andMichel Foucault, this essay\nreiterates McBride\u2019s contention that, absent divine sanc-\ntion, modern political orders must forever invent new ways\nto negotiate the destabilizing potential that attends any\naffirmation on the part of some of a right to inflict harm\non others.\nIn one way or another, the remaining essays all concern\nthe United States. Chapter 4 indicates how certain of the\nRepublic\u2019s Founders articulated a penology predicated on\na form of \u201cdemocratic idealism\u201d (p. 13) in order to con-\nfirm the new nation\u2019s repudiation of the authoritarian pun-\nishments characteristic of England, whereas Chapter 5\nargues that this idealism has now almost entirely disap-\npeared from contemporary discussions of punishment in\n| |\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nMarch 2008 | Vol. 6\/No. 1 163\n"}
