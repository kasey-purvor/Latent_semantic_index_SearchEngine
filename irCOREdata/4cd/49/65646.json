Although this is to be welcomed, to date there has been an over-reliance on Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology (1990). This is despite the fact that it has been\nsubjected to extensive criticism and that there are in fact a number of competing welfare state typologies\nwithin the comparative social policy literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide public health\nresearchers with an up-to-date overview of the welfare state regime literature so that it can be reflected more\naccurately in future research. It outlines The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology, and it presents the\ncriticisms it received and an overview of alternative welfare state typologies. It concludes by suggesting new\navenues of study in public health that could be explored by drawing upon this broader welfare state regimes\nliterature.\nI\nnternational research on the social determinants of health\nand health inequalities has increasingly begun to draw upon\nthe comparative social policy literature. Specifically, research\nhas concentrated on examining, and to some extent explaining,\ndifferences in health outcomes between and within developed\ncountries by comparing different types of welfare state regimes\nand their respective politics and policies.1\u201310 Recent calls for\nfurther analysis of the political nature of health (and indeed the\ncreation of \u2018\u2018political epidemiology\u2019\u2019) suggest that it is likely\nthat such research will grow in the future.11 12 However, public\nhealth research has to date relied extensively on the typology of\nwelfare state regimes proposed by Esping-Andersen in his 1990\npublication (which used 1980 data), The three worlds of welfare\ncapitalism.13 This is despite the fact that within the discipline of\nsocial policy, Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology has long been the\nsubject of extensive scholarly criticism and there is in fact a\nnumber of competing welfare state typologies that may also be\nof use in public health research.14\u201322 The purpose of this paper is\nto provide public health researchers and epidemiologists with\nan up-to-date overview of the social policy literature on welfare\nstate regimes, so that our research can reflect and benefit from\nthe more contemporaneous insights on offer from the \u2018\u2018welfare\nmodelling business\u2019\u2019.20 21\nThis paper begins by summarising Esping-Andersen\u2019s semi-\nnal work, The three worlds of welfare capitalism; it then presents\nthe various criticisms that this theory received and outlines the\nresulting alternative welfare state typologies that emerged. It\nconcludes by suggesting new avenues of study in public health\nthat could be explored by drawing upon this broader welfare\nstate regimes literature. Although there are existing reviews of\nwelfare state regime theory, these are somewhat outdated and,\nperhaps more importantly, they were not written specifically for\nor publicised to a public health audience.20 21\nTHE THREE WORLDS OF WELFARE\nIn The three worlds of welfare capitalism (1990),13 Esping-Andersen\npresents a typology of 18 Organisation of Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) welfare states based\nupon three principles: decommodification (the extent to which\nan individual\u2019s welfare is reliant upon the market, particularly\nin terms of pensions, unemployment benefit and sickness\ninsurance), social stratification (the role of welfare states in\nmaintaining or breaking down social stratification) and the\nprivate\u2013public mix (the relative roles of the state, the family,\nthe voluntary sector and the market in welfare provision). The\noperationalisation of these principles, largely using decom-\nmodification indexes, leads to the division of welfare states into\nthree ideal regime types (Esping-Andersen; Table 1): Liberal,\nConservative and Social Democratic.13\nIn the Liberal regime countries, state provision of welfare is\nminimal, benefits are modest and often attract strict entitle-\nment criteria, and recipients are usually means-tested and\nstigmatised. The Conservative welfare state regime is distin-\nguished by its \u2018\u2018status differentiating\u2019\u2019 welfare programmes in\nwhich benefits are often earnings-related, administered\nthrough the employer and geared towards maintaining existing\nsocial patterns. The role of the family is also emphasised and\nthe redistributive impact is minimal. The Social Democratic\nregime is the smallest regime cluster. Welfare provision is\ncharacterised by universal and comparatively generous benefits,\na commitment to full employment and income protection, and\na strongly interventionist state used to promote equality\nthrough a redistributive social security system.13\nGOING BEYOND THE THREE WORLDS OF WELFARE\nCAPITALISM\nThe three worlds of welfare capitalism typology has sparked a\nvolatile and ongoing debate and, indeed, much of the\nburgeoning comparative social policy literature since 1990 can\nbe seen as a \u2018\u2018settling of accounts\u2019\u2019 with Esping-Andersen.21 23\nThis process has led to the development of alternative\ntypologies, many of which are intended to reflect aspects that\nwere not examined in Esping-Andersen\u2019s original typology, that\nextend the range of countries included in the analysis, and that\ntake more account of gender, politics or the role of public\nservices.4 16\u201319 22\u201337 The criticism has been on three fronts:\ntheoretical, methodological and empirical.\nAbbreviation: OECD, Organisation of Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment\n1098\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nTable 1 Welfare state

5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nTheoretical critiques\nThe range of countries and regimes\nThe range of countries used to construct Esping-Andersen\u2019s\ntypology has met with criticism.17\u201319 22 Esping-Andersen only\nexamined 18 OECD countries and in doing so he placed both\nItaly and Japan within the Conservative regime. Some\ncommentators assert that when the Latin rim countries of the\nEuropean Union (Spain, Portugal, Greece) are added into the\nanalysis, a fourth \u2018\u2018Southern\u2019\u2019 world of welfare emerges into\nwhich Italy can also be placed (Bonoli, Ferrera, Liebfreid;\nTable 1).17\u201319 The Southern welfare states are described as\n\u2018\u2018rudimentary\u2019\u2019 because they are characterised by their frag-\nmented system of welfare provision, which consists of diverse\nincome maintenance schemes, ranging from the meagre to the\ngenerous, and a healthcare system that provides only limited\nand partial coverage.19 Reliance on the family and voluntary\nsector is also a prominent feature.\nFurthermore, research into East Asian welfare states (South\nKorea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore) has suggested that\nthese countries, including Japan, form a further Confucian\nwelfare state regime.24 28 37 The Confucian welfare state is\ncharacterised by low levels of government intervention and\ninvestment in social welfare, underdeveloped public service\nprovision, and the fundamental importance of the family and\nvoluntary sector in providing social safety nets. This minimalist\napproach is combined with Confucian social ethics (obligation\nfor immediate family members, thrift, diligence, and a strong\neducation and work ethic).37 Overall, the Confucian welfare\nstate regime could be considered as combining some elements\nof the Liberal, Conservative and Southern regimes.\nIn addition, Castles and Mitchell (1993) cross-classified the\nsame 18 OECD nations used by Esping-Andersen and examined\ntheir high- and low-aggregate expenditure levels, and their\nhigh and low degrees of benefit equality. On the basis of this\nanalysis, they argued that the UK, Australia and New Zealand\nconstitute a Radical, targeted form of welfare state, one in\nwhich \u2018\u2018the welfare goals of poverty amelioration and income\nequality are pursued through redistributive instruments rather\nthan by high expenditure levels\u2019\u2019 (Castles and Mitchell;\nTable 1).22 In the same vein, Korpi and Palme describe the\nexistence of a Targeted welfare state regime (Korpi and Palme;\nTable 1).32\nThe gender-blind \u2018\u2018worlds of welfare\u2019\u2019\nIt has been argued that the analysis behind The three worlds of\nwelfare capitalism typology was \u2018\u2018gender-blind\u2019\u2019 (androgy-\nnous).34 35 Aside from the overt absence of women in Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s analysis, the critique revolves around three other\nissues: the gender-blind concept of decommodification, the\nunawareness of the role of women and the family in the\nprovision of welfare, and the lack of consideration given to\ngender as a form of social stratification.33\u201335 These criticisms\nsuggest limitations to the comprehensiveness and generalisa-\nbility of the Three Worlds thesis \u2013 especially in regard to any\nclaims about women, welfare and the family.\nThe gender-blind critique of Esping-Andersen has led to both\ntheoretical attempts to \u2018\u2018gender\u2019\u2019 his analysis, and also, the\nconstruction of alternative welfare state typologies in which\ngender has been a more overt and centralised part of the\nanalysis.16 25 29 31 34\u201336 Most notable amongst these new typolo-\ngies are the defamilisation approaches that examine the extent\nto which welfare states, and welfare state regimes, facilitate\nfemale autonomy and economic independence from the\nfamily.16 25 29 31 The difference made to the composition, and\nnumber, of welfare state regimes made by the addition of a\ndefamilisation-based analysis, however, is contested and is\nrather dependent on how the concept is operationalised.16\nHowever, to date, there has been no exploration of defamilisa-\ntion and health or indeed how the relationship between gender\nand health varies by welfare state regime.\nThe \u2018\u2018i l lusion\u2019\u2019 of welfare state regimes\nThis critique focuses on Esping-Andersen\u2019s decision to organise\nthe principle of classification around the study of social\ntransfers: pensions, sickness benefits and unemployment\nbenefits.20 26 27 30 This ignores the fact that welfare states are\nalso about the actual delivery of services such as healthcare,\neducation or social services.30 It is suggested that countries vary\nin terms of the emphasis that they place upon welfare state\nservices and\/or social transfers.27 30 However, Esping-Andersen\u2019s\nregimes concept generalises about all forms of welfare state\nprovision on the basis of social transfers.38 This has led some to\nquestion the validity of the regimes concept itself as it assumes\nthat most of the key social policy areas within a welfare regime\nwill reflect a similar, across the board, approach to welfare\nprovision; and second, that each regime type itself reflects \u2018\u2018a\nset of principles or values that establishes a coherence in each\ncountry\u2019s welfare package\u2019\u2019.38\nThis has resulted in the production of alternative typologies\nbased on the extent of services provided by different welfare\nstates.26 27 30 These are often substantially different in composi-\ntion from The three worlds of welfare capitalism. For example,\nKautto\u2019s comparison of the balance between expenditure on\nsocial transfers and welfare services in 15 European countries\nconcluded that welfare states could indeed be divided into three\nregimes but these were very different in composition and\nemphasis from Esping-Andersen\u2019s The three worlds of welfare\ncapitalism (Kautto; Table 1).30 Similarly, a typology based on the\ncomparison of the decommodification of healthcare services\nand social transfers in 18 OECD countries led to a fivefold\ntypology suggesting subgroups within both the Conservative\nand Liberal regimes (Bambra; Table 1).27\nTaking the logic of this critique further still, researchers from\nthe field of political economy have suggested that analysing\n\u2018\u2018political\u2019\u2019 regimes may prove to be a more fruitful research\nparadigm.4 7 In addition to criticising The three worlds of welfare\ncapitalism,4 7 they have also highlighted the limited nature of the\nother alternative typologies, which, in common with Esping-\nAndersen, focus too much on the characteristics of welfare\nstates to the exclusion of a thorough examination of the policies\nand politics underpinning and supporting them. Subsequently,\na more historical\u2013political analysis led to the development of a\nfourfold political typology of welfare states (Navarro and Shi;\nTable 1) in which Greece, Spain and Portugal form an ex-\nFascist regime.4\nMethodological issues\nThe limitations of Esping-Andersen\u2019s methodology have also\nbeen exposed. Attention has been placed particularly upon the\nadditive nature of the decommodification indexes, weighting\nwithin the indexes, the reliance upon averaging, and the use of\none standard deviation around the mean to classify the\ncountries into regimes (which meant that only a threefold\nclassification was possible: regime classification is either above\n[Social Democratic], below [Liberal] or within [Conservative]\none standard deviation around the mean).13 14 22 39\u201341 This\nmethod has a noticeable impact on the classification of certain\ncountries, eg. the UK which, if a different cut-off point was\nused, may not have fallen within the Liberal regime.14 42 These\nconcerns led to the utilisation of more statistically robust\nmethodologies (most notably cluster analysis), the results of\nwhich have challenged the accuracy of the threefold typology\nby identifying four or five different types of welfare state\n(Kangas, Ragin, Pitzurello; Table 1).39\u201341\n1100 Bambra\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nEmpirical validity\nSomewhat inevitably, this has led to the questioning of the\nongoing empirical validity of The three worlds of welfare capitalism\ntypology. Recently Esping-Andersen\u2019s study was replicated and\nthe results differed substantially from the original.43 In\naddition, it has been found that the miscalculation of the\nmean and standard deviation in the original Three worlds of\nwelfare capitalism data led to the misclassification of three\nborderline countries (Japan, UK and Ireland).10 Furthermore,\nan updated analysis of decommodification using data from\n1998\/9 has suggested that the relationships between the 18\nOECD countries have changed significantly and that the\ncomposition of welfare state regimes is not static.10 Taken\ntogether, these pieces of research bring into question the extent\nto which The three worlds of welfare capitalism still exist, and\nindeed, at least in empirical terms, the extent to which they\never did.14\nPUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH BEYOND THE THREE\nWORLDS OF WELFARE CAPITALISM\nIn light of this overview, it seems somewhat bizarre that public\nhealth research has been near oblivious to these substantial\ndevelopments in social policy research since the publication of\nThe three worlds of welfare capitalism in 1990 and that, with the\nnotable exception of work by the political economy school,2\u20134 7\nepidemiological research utilises Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology in\na surprisingly uncritical manner. Indeed, a recent overview of\nwelfare states and health inequalities makes scant mention of\nthe existence of alternative regime typologies.6 Furthermore,\nEsping-Andersen\u2019s typology is often used to justify the choice of\ncase study countries and subsequent findings are implicitly\napplied to all other countries in that particular regime.1\nAlthough The three worlds of welfare capitalism is clearly an\nacceptable starting point in terms of examining within and\nbetween welfare state differences in health, it is vital for the\nongoing utility of public health research in this area that in the\nfuture it is able to more adequately reflect, and therefore benefit\nfrom, the evolution of welfare state regime theory. More\nawareness of the wider regimes literature and going beyond The\nthree worlds of welfare capitalism will be a useful first stage and\none to which hopefully this paper has contributed.\nLooking further ahead, there needs to be more critical\nengagement with the concept of regimes starting with an\nawareness that they are in fact \u2018\u2018ideal types\u2019\u2019. In practice,\nwelfare provision varies extensively between countries of the\nsame regime type.38 For example, research has indicated that\nsome countries are more central to a particular regime than\nothers (eg. Sweden or the USA) and offer a more coherent\napproach across both social transfers and welfare services.27\nOther countries\u2019 profile (and therefore regime type) can vary\nextensively depending on which factors are used in regime\nconstruction. One avenue for future research would therefore\nbe to examine the competing typologies and establish which\nworks best in terms of health outcomes and public health\nresearch. For example, cluster analysis techniques could be used\nto create health-based taxonomies of welfare states which could\nbe compared with existing welfare state typologies (Table 1).16\nThis work would also enable more theoretical advancement\nin terms of how welfare state regimes are expected to impact on\nhealth and health inequalities.6 This is especially the case in\nterms of welfare states, gender and health where, for example,\nthere is the opportunity to develop both theoretical and\nempirical accounts of how welfare state regimes may moderate\nthe relationship between gender and health status. Indeed,\nconcepts from the wider comparative social policy literature,\nsuch as defamilisation, could also be unpacked and operatio-\nnalised in relation to health.16 25 29 31\nTo date, much of the engagement by public health\nresearchers with the regimes literature has been at the overall\npopulation level.1\u20134 7\u201310 There has been little research examining\nhow different population subgroups fare in different welfare\nstate regimes (for example, women, immigrant groups, lone\nmothers, etc.).5 44 Furthermore, the political economy of health\nresearch could be progressed by comparing countries that are\nthe most similar in terms of welfare state provision, identifying\nareas of difference and exploring how these may contribute to\ncross-national differences in health and health inequalities.\nThese types of research would help overcome some of the more\nbanal generalisations inherent within regime research and\nwould perhaps provide the opportunity for better advice to\npolicy-makers on specific interventions. Similarly, the life\ncourse approach to health inequalities could be extended to\nexamine variation in countries from different welfare state\nregimes.45 Ultimately though, for this area of research to\nexpand, there is a clear need for increased dialogue and more joint\nresearch between social policy analysts and epidemiologists.\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nREFERENCES\n1 Martikainen P, Lahelma E, Marmot M, et al.
