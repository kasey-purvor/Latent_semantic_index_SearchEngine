INTRODUCTION \nThe perceived future exploitation of magnetic coupling and \nmagnetic gearbox transmission technology is driven by the \nunique advantages over purely mechanical counterparts viz. \nreduced maintenance requirements and improved reliability, \nphysical isolation between input and output shafts, elimination \nof gearbox jamming, and inherent overload protection [1].  \nWhile the static torque transmission capability of magnetic \ncouplings\/gears can compete with traditional mechanical \ncoupling\/gearbox counterparts [2] currently, the primary \nimpediment for their adoption, and the potential safety and \neconomic benefits they can bring to a multitude of application \nsectors, is the high-compliance characteristics which currently \nlimit their use to systems with relatively low-bandwidth \ndynamic transients. Moreover, the problem becomes \nparticularly acute for applications where it is prohibitive to \nuse load-side feedback sensors, by virtue of their proximity, \nreliability, connection, specification, cost or load-side working \nenvironment. Applications such as those for aircraft flight \ncontrol surface actuators, future all-electric automotive power \ntrains and off-shore wind-turbines fall into this category [3], \n[4], [5]. In addition, research for marine applications, tidal \nturbines etc, is also being undertaken, as reported in [6], [7]. \nAlthough magnetic gearboxes and pseudo-direct drive \nsystems are gaining increasing favor, magnetic coupling \ncounterparts have previously found application in systems that \nrequire separation of prime-mover and driven shaft in a non-\ncontact manner viz. clean rooms and particular types of \nisolated liquid agitation, with torque densities in the range \n300-400 kNm\/m3.  \nMore recently, Atallah et al [8] reported a new magnetic \ngear topology employing rare earth magnets that promises \nhigh torque densities and high efficiency torque transmission. \nThe proposed magnetic gear consists of a concentric inner, \nhigh-speed rotor, and an arrangement of permanent magnets \nand a low speed outer rotor\u0097\u2014see Fig. 1 for instance. \n978-1-4244-5795-3\/10\/$26.00 \u00a92010 IEEE 1192\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Paul Stewart.

Restrictions apply. \n \nFig. 1 Schematic of a magnetic gear \nKey parameters that dictate the characteristics of the \nmagnetic gear in Fig. 1 are number of high-speed rotor poles \n(e.g. Ph = 4), the number of low speed rotor poles (e.g. Pl = \n22), and the number of stationary steel pole-pieces (e.g. ns = \n26). From [8] then, the effective gear ratio Ngear is given by: \n \n5.5\n1\n264\n4\n\u2212=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n=\nsh\nh\ngear np\npN   (1) \nThe negative polarity indicates that inner and outer rotors \ncontra-rotate. The magnetic gearbox investigated in [9] has a \ncalculated torque-per-unit-volume of more than 100 kNm \/m3, \nin-line with some mechanical counterparts.  \nWhilst key advantages of magnetic gear\/coupling \ntechnologies is the \u0091\u2018anti-jamming\u0092\u2019 and mechanically isolated \ninput-output torque transmission features, the torque vs. \nmechanical displacement angle characteristic is highly non-\nlinear. Furthermore, when overload conditions occur, \nmagnetic gears\/couplings are subject to over-torque \u0091\u2018pole-\nslipping\u0092\u2019.  The application of magnetic gear technology for \nservo-control systems requires greater consideration to be \ngiven to the overall dynamic system behavior, and the \nremedial strategies to be applied in the event of over-torque \n\u0091\u2018pole-slipping\u0092\u2019.  An example \u0091\u2018research roadmap\u0092\u2019 is given in \nFig. 2 to highlight pertinent issues. \nII. MAGNETIC GEAR CHARACTERISATION \nTo provide a focus to the analysis, an experimental \nmagnetic gear has been constructed with a maximum coupling \ntorque of ~5.7 N.m.  The gear consists of 3-pole-pairs on both \nthe inner and outer rotors, giving a gear ratio of 1:1, for \nsimplicity. A schematic of the magnetic gear construction is \nshown in Fig. 3.  \nThe prototype magnetic gear is assembled into a \nstatic\/dynamic test-rig consisting of two permanent magnet \n(PMSM) 4kW machines and two Unidrive inverters under the \ncontrol of a dSPACE hardware development platform, see Fig. \n4(a).  In this case, one machine acts as the prime-mover whilst \nthe second imparts a (possibly) dynamic load. By using \nposition control, the displacement position angle between the \ntwo sides of the magnetic gear can be controlled, and the static \n\u0091\u2018holding torque\u0092\u2019 measured. The resulting torque vs. \nmechanical displacement angle is shown in Fig. 4(b). \n \nFig. 2 Magnetic gear \u0091\u2018research roadmap\u0092\u2019 \nFig. 3.

Additionally, from \na dynamics perspective, an effective \u0091\u2018damping\u0092\u2019 torque may \nalso be designed into the magnetic gear characteristic. \nAlthough from a magnetic analysis perspective the origins are \ncomplex and beyond the scope of this paper, the damping that \ncan be magnetically introduced is described by: \n)(,2)(\n22 LMD\nD\nD\nGD TB \u03c9\u03c9\u03c9\u03b2\u03c9\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u2212=\n+\n=  (3) \n \nwhere \u03b1 represents a percentage of the gear\u0092\u2019s maximum \ntorque capability and \u03b2  represents the relative displacement \nangle at which maximum damping torque occurs.

MODELLING OF MAGNETIC GEAR \nA. Dual-inertia servo-drive model \nA representation of a two-inertia servo-drive system is \nshown in Fig. 7. For a conventional system, the \ninterconnecting shaft has a stiffness K (N.m\/rad) and is \nconsidered to be linear within its operating range.

However, just prior to the \nover-torque condition being reached the magnetic gear \nbehaves as a nonlinear \u0091\u2018soft\u0092\u2019 torsional spring. When linearized \nabout the origin, the torsional stiffness in this case is given \nby \u2248= Glin pTK 17 N.m\/rad. The linearized transfer \ncharacteristic is shown (solid line) in Fig. 8. By way of \ncomparison, a medium torsional stiffness coupling rated at 22 \nN.m has a torsional stiffness constant of 2500 N.m\/rad [10].  \nNow, from a classical perspective, the linear torsion stiffness \nconstant K of a two-inertia mechanical system with a non-stiff \ncoupling, can be replaced by the nonlinear function )( DK \u03b8 , \nrelating transmitted torque vs. relative angular displacement, \nbetween the motor-side and the load-side of the magnetic gear, \nand )( DB \u03c9 , the nonlinear dynamic damping function.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nWhilst \u0091\u2018stiff\u0092\u2019 torque transmission systems make mechanical \npower transfer relatively straightforward to control, significant \ncomplication and dynamic degradation occurs when shaft \ncompliance is present, leading to under-damped load-side \nbehavior and, in some instances, catastrophic failure of \nconnecting shafts or mechanical gearboxes. Although \ncatastrophic failure conditions are ameliorated when using \nmagnetic gearboxes and couplings, the \u0091\u2018low stiffness\u0092\u2019 problem \nis exacerbated by virtue of the nonlinear characteristics of \nmagnetic gears and the over-torque \u0091\u2018pole-slipping\u0092\u2019 problem.  \nBy way of example, Fig. 11 shows results from a 1500 rpm \nstep demand speed input under an optimized controller that \nhas been designed based on minimizing the ITAE metric for \nan ideal linear shaft. Despite the low stiffness of the magnetic \ngear, excellent load rejection is obtained with the ITAE-\noptimised PI controller. \n0 5 10 15\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nTime (sec)\nSp\ne\ne\nd \n(x1\n00\n0r\npm\n)\nLoad rejection 50% maximum design torque\n0 5 10 15\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nTime (sec)\nSp\ne\ned\n \n(x1\n00\n0r\npm\n)\nLoad rejection 90% maximum design torque\n \nTo investigate the effects of \u0091\u2018pole-slipping\u0092\u2019, the \nexperimental system is subject to i) a load torque that is \ngreater than the maximum design torque, GT , and ii) excess \ncontrol torque resulting from \u0091\u2018too aggressive\u0092\u2019 control action \nfrom the prime-mover. Effectively, this induces \u0091\u2018pole-\nslipping\u0092\u2019 from either side of the magnetic gear\u0097\u2014ultimately a \ncombination of the two will also result in \u0091\u2018pole-slipping\u0092\u2019.  \nFigs. 12, 13 show measured results from both scenarios. \nFrom Fig. 12, at st 75.1\u2245  an over-load torque is applied to \nthe drive-train, causing pole-slipping. Whilst the speed \ncontroller on the prime-mover acts to try and maintain the \n1000 rpm demanded, an effective zero-mean load speed is \nseen. From Fig. 2, this represents conditions on the right-hand \nside of the flow chart, i.e. over-torque pole-slipping due to \nexcess load-side torque. The dual condition is from excessive \ncontrol action, depicted on the left-hand side of the flowchart, \nas in Fig. 13. \n From a classical perspective, the effect of \u0091\u2018pole-slipping\u0092\u2019 \nconstitutes a loss of control of the drive train. Consequently, it \nis necessary to provide \u0091\u2018pole-slip\u0092\u2019 detection and recovery\u0096\u2013 if \npossible! \n0 2 4 6\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\nMotor-side step response\nTime (s)\nSp\ne\ne\nd \n(rp\nm\n)\n0 2 4 6\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\nLoad-side step response\nTime (s)\nSp\ne\ne\nd \n(rp\nm\n)\n \n Fig. 12 Excess load-side torque leading to pole-slipping \n0 2 4 6\n-600\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\nMotor-side step response\nTime (s)\nSp\nee\nd \n(rp\nm\n)\n0 2 4 6\n-600\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\nLoad-side step response\nTime (s)\nSp\ne\ne\nd \n(rp\nm\n)\n \nFig. 13 Excess motor-side torque leading to pole-slipping \nEmpirical studies have made it apparent that over-torque \npole-slipping imposes a modulation onto the speed feedback \nsignal (or error signal).

In each case, the modulating sine wave \nindicates that the magnetic gearbox has entered a pole-\nslipping regime. Further examination of the power spectral \ndensity estimates of the error signals reveals a clearly \nidentifiable signature (in this instance a single sine wave), \nindicating that an over-torque pole-slipping condition is taking \nplace, Fig. 15. \nThe presence of a modulating sine wave on the speed \nfeedback signal can be used by the controller to detect gear \noverload conditions, i.e. in around 50 ms or less. \nConsequently, the opportunity then exists for the \nimplementation of remedial action by the controller, allowing \nthe magnetic gear to be \u0091\u2018reset\u0092\u2019 to normal power delivery \nwithin its operating range.  \n2 2.05 2.1 2.15 2.2\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\nSpeed feedback signal indicating over-torque slipping\nTime (s)\nSp\nee\nd \n(rp\nm\n)\n \nFig. 14 Sine wave modulation due to over-torque pole-slipping for 1000 rpm, \n1200 rpm step demands \n0 50 100 150 200 250\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5 x 10\n-4 Estimates of error signal Power Spectral Density\nPo\nw\ner\n \nde\nn\ns\nity\n \n(W\n\/H\nz)\nFrequency (Hz)\nFig. 15 PSD estimates pole-slipping for 1000 rpm & 1200 rpm demands \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nThe paper addresses some of the most important and \noutstanding issues for the widespread application of magnetic \ngearboxes and couplings viz. the controlled recovery from \noverload conditions. Through detailed dynamics analysis and \nexperimental results, the paper shows how complex nonlinear \nbehavior imparted by these systems can be accommodated, \nthereby opening up their application to the wider field of servo \nmotion control systems, and providing jam-free solutions for \nmechanical torque transmission.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work is carried out with the support of the UK EPSRC, \nby way of the provision of a PhD studentship. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Rizk, J.; Nagrial, M.H.; Hellany, A., \"Analysis and design of \nmagnetic torque couplers and magnetic gears,\" Power Electronics \nand Motion Control Conference, 2004.
