The deterministic optimal control function is identified with the corresponding\noptimal fluctuational force, which is found by numerical and analog simulations.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Gg, 02.50.\u2013 r, 05.20.\u2013y, 05.40.\u2013aThe stability of chaotic systems in the presence of noise\nand methods for controlling these systems are of intrinsic\ninterdisciplinary interest and of obvious importance in re-\nlation to applications. Methods already available [1] for\nthe control of chaos include entraining to a chosen \u201cgoal\ndynamics,\u201d which necessarily requires large modifications\nof the system\u2019s dynamics [2,3], and a variety of minimal\nforms of interaction [4\u20136] which have hitherto been re-\nstricted by the linear approximations adopted.\nThe energy-optimal implementation of deterministic\nswitching from the basin of attraction of a chaotic attractor\n(CA) has remained an unsolved archetypal problem [7]\nfor a long time. Its solution must amount to an important\nextension of the range of model-exploration objectives\n(cf. [2] and [5]) achievable through minimal control tech-\nniques. At the same time, the seemingly separate question\nof noise-induced escape from the basin of attraction of a\nCA has remained a major scientific challenge ever since\nthe first attempts to generalize the classical escape problem\nto cover this case [8]. These two apparently quite different\nproblems are usually considered separately within the\ndistinct subfields of deterministic and stochastic nonlinear\ndynamics. See, however, Ref. [9] for a discussion of the\ninterrelationship between stochastic and control problems,\nand, in particular, [9](c) for the analogy between their\nvariational formulations.\nIn this Letter we show how the energy-optimal control\nof chaos can be effected via an analogy between the varia-\ntional formulations of both problems using a statistical\nanalysis of fluctuational trajectories. The main difficulty\nin tackling these problems stems from the complexity of\nthe system dynamics near a CA and is related, in particular,\nto delicate questions concerning the uniqueness of the so-\nlution and the boundary conditions at a CA. The approach\nproposed below is based on the analysis of an oscillator\ninteracting with a thermal bath. In the zero-noise intensity\nlimit, a consistent theoretical development [10,11] from the\nmicroscopic to the macroscopic equations of motion leads\nto descriptions of both its deterministic (dissipative) and\nfluctuational dynamics within the framework of Hamil-\ntonian formalism [12]. It can be shown both on physical0031-9007\u000400\u000485(10)\u00042100(4)$15.00grounds and rigorously that the Wentzel-Freidlin Hamil-\ntonian [12] arising in this approach is equivalent to the\nPontryagin Hamiltonian in the control problem [7] with\nan additive linear unrestricted control; the corresponding\noptimal control function is equivalent to the optimal fluc-\ntuational force [9](c).\nWe illustrate the approach by analyzing the motion of a\nperiodically driven nonlinear oscillator\n\u0001q1 \u0002 K1\u0001q\u0001t\u0002\u0002 \u0002 q2 ,\n\u0001q2 \u0002 K2\u0001q\u0001t\u0002\u0002 1 u\u0001t\u0002 (1)\n\u000222Gq2 2v\n2\n0q1 2 bq\n2\n1 2 gq\n3\n1 2 h cos\u0001Vt\u00021 u\u0001t\u0002 .\nHere u\u0001t\u0002 is the control function. Parameters were chosen\nsuch that the potential is monostable \u0001b2 , 4gv20\u0002, the\ndependence of the energy of oscillations on their frequency\nis nonmonotonic \u0001 b\n2\ngv20\n.\n9\n10 \u0002, and the motion is under-\ndamped G \u00f8 V \u0003 2v0. This model is of interest in a\nnumber of contexts in which theoretical analysis is pos-\nsible for a wide range of parameter values [13]. It is a\nsystem in which chaos can be observed at relatively small\nvalues h \u0003 0.1 of the driving force amplitude.\nFor a given damping \u0001G \u0002 0.025\u0002 the amplitude and fre-\nquency of the driving force were chosen so that the chaotic\nattractor coexists with the stable limit cycle (SC in Fig. 1).\nThe chaotic state appears via period-doubling bifurcations\nand thus corresponds to a nonhyperbolic attractor (NHA).\nIts boundary of attraction \u2260V is nonfractal and is formed\nby the saddle cycle of period 1 (S1). For details about the\nphase diagram, see Ref. [14].\nWe have considered the following energy-optimal con-\ntrol problem. The system (1) with unconstrained control\nfunction u\u0001t\u0002 is to be steered from the NHA to the stable\nlimit cycle in such a way that the energy (\u201ccost\u201d) func-\ntional R is minimized, with t1 unspecified,\nR \u0002 inf\nu[U\n1\n2\nZ t1\nt0\nu2\u0001t\u0002 dt . (2)\nHere the control set U consists of functions (control sig-\nnals) which are able to move the system from the NHA to\nthe SC.\u00a9 2000 The American Physical Society\nVOLUME 85, NUMBER 10 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 4 SEPTEMBER 2000FIG. 1. The basins of attraction of the stable limit cycle SC\n(shaded) and NHA (white) for a Poincar\u00e9 cross section with\nVt \u0002 0.6p (mod2p), V \u0002 0.95. The largest Lyapunov expo-\nnent for the NHA is 0.0449. The period-1 saddle cycle S1 at the\nNHA boundary \u2260V is shown by the filled square. The saddle\ncycle of period 3 is shown by plusses. Intersections of the actual\nescape trajectory with the Poincar\u00e9 cross section are indicated\nby the small filled circles.\nIt can be shown (see, e.g., Ref. [7]) that, if a solution of\nthe control problem \u0005u\u00af\u0001t\u0002,q\u0001t\u0002\u0006 exists, there also exists a\ncontinuous piecewise differentiable function p\u0001t\u0002 \u0002\n\u0007p1\u0001t\u0002,p2\u0001t\u0002\b such that\n\u0001qi \u0002\n\u2260Hc\n\u2260pi\n, \u0001pi \u0002 2\n\u2260Hc\n\u2260qi\n, i \u0002 \u00071, 2\b ,\nHc \u0002 1\u00042p22 1 p1K1 1 p2K2 . (3)\nHere the variables p1\u0001t\u0002,p2\u0001t\u0002 are not simultaneously zero\nand it is assumed that the optimal control function u\u00af\u0001t\u0002 at\neach instant takes those values u\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 p2 that maximize\nHc over U.\nThe function R in (2) coincides (up to a constant scal-\ning factor) with the definition of the activation energy for\nfluctuational transitions between the NHA and the SC if\nthe control signal u\u0001t\u0002 in (1) is substituted with zero-mean\nwhite Gaussian noise j\u0001t\u0002 [12] such that\n\tj\u0001t\u0002\n \u0002 0, \tj\u0001t\u0002j\u00010\u0002\n \u0002 Dd\u0001t\u0002 . (4)\nCorrespondingly, the function Hc (3) coincides with the\nHamiltonian H of an auxiliary Hamiltonian system (3)\nwhich determines the optimal fluctuational paths (see, e.g.,\nRefs. [12,15]). Thus the optimal control signal u\u00af\u0001t\u0002 can\nbe identified with the optimal fluctuational force [9](c)\nwhich drives the system from the NHA to the SC. We\nnote that both u\u00af\u0001t\u0002 and the optimal force are related to p2\nin (3). This interrelationship is intuitively clear because,\nin thermal equilibrium \u0001D \u0002 4GkBT \u0002, the probability of\nfluctuations is determined by the minimum work from the\nexternal source needed to produce the given change in the\nthermodynamic quantities r ~ exp\u00012Rmin\u0004kBT\u0002 [16]. Wetherefore suggest that the optimal control function u\u00af\u0001t\u0002 can\nbe found experimentally by measurement of the optimal\nfluctuational force [17,18].\nWe have tested this idea through analog electronic\nmodeling [18] of (1) and digital simulation following the\nprescriptions of [19]. Qualitatively similar results were\nobtained but, because precision is of particular importance\nhere, the data reported below are those from the digital\nsimulations. The underlying idea is that, when the system\n(1) is driven by a random force j\u0001t\u0002 (4) instead of u\u0001t\u0002, it\nwill occasionally fluctuate to \u2260V. In doing so, in the limit\nwhere the noise intensity tends to zero, the system will\nfollow very closely the deterministic trajectories of (3).\nFor the technique to be applicable a solution of (3) mov-\ning the system from the NHA to \u2260V must exist, and one\nhas to be able to identify the boundary conditions for this\nsolution on the NHA. Earlier numerical simulations [20]\ndemonstrated that a solution does indeed exist and that it\nis typically unique in the limit D ! 0.\nThe method involves monitoring the system continu-\nously and collecting all successful realizations \u0005qesc1 \u0001t\u0002,\nqesc2 \u0001t\u0002,jesc\u0001t\u0002\u0006, moving it from the NHA to \u2260V. From\nthese realizations, a time-dependent prehistory distribu-\ntion is built [17]. In the present case, this distribution\nturns out to be characterized by a narrow ridge, as the\nnoise intensity is decreased, allowing us to define an ap-\nproximate solution u\u02dc\u0001t\u0002 for the control function [the ex-\nact solution is u\u00af\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 limD!0 u\u02dc\u0001t\u0002], corresponding to the\nmaximum of the distribution. The boundary conditions are\nfound by analysis of how the energy-optimal escape path\n\u0005\tqesc1 \u0001t\u0002\n, \tq\nesc\n2 \u0001t\u0002\n\u0006 merges with the NHA. Note that the\ntopological features of the prehistory distribution yield di-\nrect insight into the control problem: where the prehistory\ndistribution does not develop a well-defined ridge in the\nD ! 0 limit, we may infer that control via a simple func-\ntion is not achievable.\nAn actual escape trajectory is indicated in Poincar\u00e9 cross\nsection by the filled circles in Fig. 1. A typical optimal\nescape path and the corresponding optimal force, obtained\nby averaging a few hundred such trajectories, are shown in\nFig. 2. Analysis of the optimal path reveals that the sys-\ntem leaves the NHA along the unstable manifold of the\nsaddle cycle of period 5 (S5 with multipliers m1 \u0002\n0.04157 , 1 and m2 \u0002 4.60403728 . 1) embedded in\nthe NHA. At this moment the optimal fluctuational\nforce \tjesc\u0001t\u0002\n switches on, driving the system to \u2260V via\nthe saddle cycle of period 3 (S3 with multipliers m1 \u0002\n0.04873 , 1 and m2 \u0002 7.608312 . 1). Near the saddle\ncycle S1 that forms the boundary of the basin of attraction\nthe optimal force dies out. Note that no action is required\nto bring the system from S1 to the stable limit cycle. As\ndiscussed above, this path is an approximation (because\nof the finite intensity of the noise) of the optimal control\nfunction u\u00af\u0001t\u0002.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 1 that the saddle cycle S3 is not\nembedded in the NHA. It is probably the nearest saddle2101\nVOLUME 85, NUMBER 10 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 4 SEPTEMBER 2000FIG. 2.

Moreover the escape problem\nhas in this case been reduced to the analysis of transitions\nbetween three saddle cycles S5 ! S3 ! S1, in qualitative\nagreement with the well known statement that saddle\ncycles provide detailed invariant characterizations for\ndynamical systems of low intrinsic dimension (see, e.g.,\n[21,22]). We note that the solution found is independent of\nthe initial conditions on the chaotic attractor: the transient\ntime required for the system to reach S5 (in the presence\nof noise) from arbitrary initial conditions is exponentially\nsmaller then average escape time, and the quasiperiodic\nsteady state distribution is formed on the attractor prior to\nescape [23].\nOnce boundary conditions are specified one can solve\nthe corresponding boundary value problem for the system\n(3) numerically. The results of the numerical solution of\nthe boundary value problem obtained by the relaxational\nmethod are shown in Fig. 2 by the dotted lines and are in\ngood agreement with the solution found from the analysis\nof fluctuational trajectories.\nTo verify that the optimal force u\u02dc\u0001t\u0002 found in the ex-\nperiment really does minimise the energy of the control\nfunction steering the system (1) from the NHA to the SC1,\nwe set it to arbitrary initial conditions in the basin of attrac-\ntion of the NHA and let it evolve deterministically until it\npassed through the initial part of the unstable manifold of\nS5. At that moment the deterministic control function was2102switched on. For a given shape of the control function and\/\nor initial conditions, its amplitude was set to the threshold\nfor switching of the system from chaotic to regular motion\non SC1.\nIt was found that the system is very sensitive to small\nvariations in the control function: any deviation from the\nshape of u\u02dc\u0001t\u0002, or from the initial conditions found in the\nexperiment, leads to a substantial increase in the energy\nrequired to attain SC1. Some experimental results are\nshown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the energy of the con-\ntrol function is approximately twice as large if the optimal\nforce is approximated by the sin function modulated by a\nGaussian u\u0001t\u0002 \u0002 a1 sin\u0001a2t\u0002 exp\u00052\u0001t 2 a3\u00022a4\u0006, and it is,\nrespectively, \u000b4 and \u000b20 times larger if the optimal force\nis approximated by rectangular pulses or distorted with an\narbitrary low-frequency perturbation.\nWe have also performed experiments using an open-plus-\nclosed loop control technique [2] and an adaptive control\nalgorithm [3] to steer the system from the NHA to the\nFIG. 3.

(b) Energies of the control functions shown in (a).\nVOLUME 85, NUMBER 10 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 4 SEPTEMBER 2000SC1. Although these methods are designed to optimize\nthe recovery time, rather than to minimize the energy of\nthe control function, they are efficient in entraining the\nsystem dynamics to the goal dynamics. So it is interest-\ning to compare their performance with that of the control\nfunction found in our experiment. The energy of the con-\ntrol functions (see Fig. 3) obtained by these methods is\nmore than an order of magnitude larger then the energy of\nthe optimal control function u\u02dc\u0001t\u0002 found by our new tech-\nnique. The best results obtained by the open-plus-closed\nloop control are also shown in Fig. 3. Full details, together\nwith the numerical solution of the boundary value problem,\nwill be given elsewhere [24].\nOf course, the time required for the system to approach\nS5 (which is where the optimal control force can be\nswitched on) varies for different initial conditions on the\nNHA: it is typically eDp , where e is the linear dimension\nof the region and the Dp is the pointwise dimension of a\nperiodic point in this region [22]. In order to reduce this\ninitial waiting period, and thus the average transition time,\none could apply the techniques [6,25] developed earlier\nfor effecting switching between controlled saddle periodic\norbits embedded in an NHA.\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a novel technique for\nthe energy-optimal steering of a nonlinear oscillator away\nfrom the basin of attraction of an NHA, and we have veri-\nfied experimentally that it works in a particular case. The\ntechnique can readily be combined with established mini-\nmal forms of control, extending substantially the range of\nmodel-exploration objectives that can be achieved by such\nmethods. Preliminary investigations [14] indicate that the\ntechnique may also be applied in the case of the Lorenz\nattractor, whose ergodic properties are very different, and\nmodifications are needed to take account of the finite tran-\nsition time. We infer that it can be further extended to treat\ncases where the boundaries of attraction are fractal. The\npossibility of applying the technique to higher dimensional\nsystems is an open problem of immediate interest.\nThe research was supported by INTAS (Grants No.\nN 96-0305, No. N YSF 99-3920), by the Royal Society\nof London, and by the Engineering & Physical Sciences\nResearch Council (UK).\n[1] A.
