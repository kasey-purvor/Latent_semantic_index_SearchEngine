Geomagnetic Ap (Ap) 4 \nsignals are found primarily in the stratosphere, while the solar F10.7-cm radio flux (Fs) signals are 5 \nfound in both the stratosphere and troposphere. In the troposphere, 0.1\u22120.4 K increases in Ta are 6 \nassociated with Fs. Enhanced Fs signals are found when the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation 7 \n(QBO) is westerly. In the extra-polar region of the stratosphere, 0.1\u22120.6 K and 0.1\u22120.7 K increases in 8 \nTa are associated with solar irradiance and with geomagnetic activity, respectively. In these regions, Fs 9 \nsignals are strengthened when either the QBO is easterly, or geomagnetic activity is high, while Ap 10 \nsignals are strengthened when either the QBO is westerly, or solar irradiance is high. High solar 11 \nirradiance and geomagnetic activity tend to enhance each other\u2019s signatures either making the signals 12 \nstronger and symmetric about the equator or extending the signals to broader areas, or both.  Positive Ap 13 \nsignals dominate the middle Arctic stratosphere and are 2\u22125 times larger than those of Fs. When solar 14 \nirradiance is low, the signature of Ap in Ta is asymmetric about the equator, with positive signals in the 15 \nArctic stratosphere and negative signals at mid-latitudes of the NH stratosphere. Weaker stratospheric 16 \nQBO signals are associated with high Ap and Fs, suggesting possible disturbances on the QBO. The 17 \nsignals of Ap and Fs are distinct from the positive temperature anomalies resulting from volcanic 18 \neruptions. 19 \n 3\n 1 \n1.  Introduction 2 \nAn 11-year solar cycle signature has been previously found in various climate 3 \nparameters including surface temperature, cloud cover, rainfall, and tropical cyclones 4 \nat a variety of places [Hoyt and Schatten, 1997]. Based on linear 5 \nregression\/correlation analysis between F10.7-cm radio flux (Fs) and atmospheric 6 \nvariables such as geo-potential height, zonal wind or temperature, the signature of the 7 \n11-year solar cycle is also found in the NCEP\/NCAR and the ERA-40 reanalysis 8 \n[Crooks and Gray, 2005; Gleisner and Thejll, 2003; Haigh, 2003; Labitzke, 2002]. A 9 \nmain feature from those reanalysis-based studies was that a positive Fs signature is 10 \npresent in the subtropical lower stratosphere and the signature extends into the 11 \ntroposphere in two near-vertical bands, one in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the 12 \nanother in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) at latitudes 20\u221250\u00b0 [Gray et al., 2005]. 13 \nMost recently, Salby and Callaghan [2006] found that, between 1968 and 2000, 14 \natmospheric temperature correlates with the 11-year variations of Fs in the 15 \nstratosphere subtropics and the Fs signals are broadly symmetry about the equator, but 16 \nlittle solar signal can be found in the troposphere. They further revealed that the 17 \ncorrelation is enhanced and extended to the upper and middle tropospheric mid-18 \nlatitudes only if a low pass filter (~ 5 years) is applied. The tropospheric signal is, 19 \nnevertheless, considerably smaller (e.g. below 0.1 K for annual sampling) than a 20 \nnumber of previous studies [Crooks and Gray, 2005; Haigh, 2003].  21 \nOne of the most-quoted possible mechanisms for such a solar-weather relationship is 22 \nthat the ultraviolet (UV) radiation modulates ozone production in the low latitude 23 \nstratosphere. It is known that the solar radiation in the UV part of the spectrum varies 24 \n 4\nby about 5\u221210% between solar maxima and minima, and plays a major role in oxygen 1 \nand ozone photolysis within the stratosphere and mesosphere [Rottman et al., 2004]. 2 \nAn increase of oxygen (ozone) photolysis leads to ozone production (decrease). These 3 \nassociated radiative and chemical processes cause changes in the circulation conditons 4 \nof the middle and upper atmosphere and may have an indirect effect on the lower 5 \nstratosphere and on the troposphere through dynamical coupling [Haigh, 1996; 6 \nKodera and Kuroda, 2002]. For instance, Kodera and Kuroda [2002] suggested that a 7 \nsolar-UV-related forcing near the stratopause may cause dynamical feedback on the 8 \nlower atmosphere through a change of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and a 9 \nmodulation of the winter polar vortex.  10 \nBy imposing realistic spectral solar irradiance variations and associated ozone 11 \nvariations, a number of general circulation model (GCM) simulations show that 12 \nchanges in upper stratospheric ozone and winds affect the flow of energy at lower 13 \naltitudes [Haigh, 1999a; Haigh, 1999b; Haigh et al., 2005; Matthes et al., 2004; 14 \nShindell et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 2001]. The observed temperature anomaly of 1\u201315 \n2K near the stratopause from solar minimum to solar maximum can now be 16 \nreproduced by the GCMs [Gray et al., 2005]. However, the lower stratospheric 17 \nwarming in the tropics and subtropics and the seasonal progression of the poleward 18 \nand downward propagation of zonal mean zonal wind anomalies in the winter 19 \nhemisphere still cannot be reproduced [Gray et al., 2005; Hood, 2004]. In a 20 \nconstrained GCM simulation, in which tropical stratospheric wind is relaxed to 21 \nobserved wind including Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO) and Quasi Biennial 22 \nOscillation (QBO), Matthes et al. [2004] confirmed a crucial effect of tropical 23 \nstratospheric wind on the evolution of stratospheric circulation in the northern 24 \nhemisphere [Gray et al., 2001]. They also showed the structure of the observed 11-25 \n 5\nyear solar cycle response in the troposphere could be reproduced with a poleward shift 1 \nof the subtropical jets. Other GCM studies showed that Hadley cell weakening occurs 2 \nat solar maximum in response to the warming of the tropical lower stratosphere 3 \n[Haigh, 1999b]. However, in comparison to the observations, weaker solar signals are 4 \nfrequently obtained in the SH, and the positive Fs signals in the lower stratospheric 5 \ntropics and subtropics remain missing. This suggests that more than one pathway may 6 \nexist to convey solar influences from the stratosphere to the troposphere, and the 7 \nwarming in the equatorial lower stratosphere is an important feature transferring the 8 \nsolar signal to lower levels [Gray et al., 2005]. 9 \nThe discrepancy between modeled and observed solar signals implies that the GCMs 10 \nmay be missing an important mechanism [Callis et al., 2000; Rozanov et al., 2005]. 11 \nBy comparing results from the same model with the different imposed ozone 12 \ndistributions, Matthes et al. [2004] have shown that the modeled temperature response 13 \nwas very sensitive to the imposed ozone changes. In contrast to the heating effects of 14 \nsolar irradiance, coronal mass ejections, the result of momentous disruption of 15 \nmagnetic structures in the Sun\u2019s corona, cause a high-speed burst above the ambient 16 \nspeed of the solar wind. The solar wind interacts with the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and 17 \nthese disturbances cause geomagnetic activity. Studies suggest that geomagnetic 18 \nactivity can influence the Earth\u2019s atmosphere via energetic particle precipitation 19 \n(EPP) [Callis et al., 1991; Randall et al., 2005; Siskind et al., 2000; Solomon et al., 20 \n1982]. Examples of ionization by EPP are relativistic electron precipitation events 21 \nduring geomagnetic disturbances [Thorne and Larsen, 1976] and solar proton events 22 \n[Jackman and McPeters, 2004]. Through dissociation and ionization processes, EPP 23 \nleads to routine production of odd nitrogen (NOx) in the mesosphere (EPP,  > 100 keV 24 \nelectrons,  > 1 MeV protons) and thermosphere (EPP,  < 100 keV electrons, < 1 MeV 25 \n 6\nprotons), and to sporadic production of NOx directly in the stratosphere when 1 \nextremely high energetic particles are involved. During the polar winter NOx can 2 \nsurvive for more than one month, and in the presence of a strong polar vortex, 3 \ndescend into the stratosphere [Siskind et al., 2000; Solomon et al., 1982]. Once the 4 \ndescending NOx reaches the stratosphere, it persists for a much longer time, and plays 5 \na major role in the ozone balance of the stratosphere because it destroys odd oxygen 6 \n(O + O3) through catalytic reactions [Brasseur and Solomon, 1986]. For instance, 7 \nRandall et al.[2005] reported unprecedented levels of spring-time stratospheric NOx 8 \nin the NH during 2003-2004, and several studies suggested it was a result of a high 9 \nlevel of geomagnetic disturbances during early-mid winter and a strong late winter 10 \nvortex [Clilverd et al., 2006; Renard et al., 2006; Rinsland et al., 2005]. Rozanov et 11 \nal. [2005] show that the magnitude of the temperature response to energetic electron 12 \nevents can potentially exceed the effects from solar UV fluxes, particularly in the 13 \nlower part of the atmosphere in high latitudes. Using a middle atmospheric 14 \nmechanistic model, Arnold and Robinson [2001] show that geomagnetic activity 15 \ncaused by solar magnetic flux forcing can influence planetary wave propagation, 16 \nperturb the winter stratosphere significantly and produce a stronger subtropical winter 17 \njet in the mesosphere and upper stratosphere. Correlative studies also reveal 18 \nstatistically significant signals of solar wind related parameters in the atmosphere 19 \n[Boberg and Lundstedt, 2002; Bochnicek et al., 1996; Bucha and Bucha, 1998; Thejll 20 \net al., 2003].  21 \nBoth observational and modeling studies have found that the equatorial stratospheric 22 \nQBO has substantial influence on the zonal circulation of the stratosphere [Baldwin et 23 \nal., 2001; Holton and Tan, 1980; Pascoe et al., 2005].  Holton and Tan [1980] 24 \ndiscovered that when the QBO at 50 hPa is easterly, the northern polar vortex is more 25 \n 7\ndisturbed and warmer, and sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are more likely to 1 \noccur. They speculated that the phase of the QBO affects the position of the zero wind 2 \nline and appears to modulate the effectiveness of planetary waves in either 3 \nstrengthening or weakening the polar vortex. When the equatorial winds are easterly, 4 \nplanetary waves tend to propagate higher and more poleward than when the QBO is in 5 \nits westerly phase. For the months around solstice, studies show that the spatial 6 \ncharacteristics of Fs signals tend to change from one QBO phase to another both near 7 \nthe equator and in the polar region of the stratosphere [Labitzke, 1987; Labitzke, 2004; 8 \nLabitzke and van Loon, 1988; Labitzke and van Loon, 2000; Matthes et al., 2004; 9 \nNaito and Hirota, 1997]. Labitzke and van Loon [1988] revealed that the temperatures 10 \nwithin the stratospheric winter vortex are positively (negatively) correlated with the 11 \n11-year SSC when the QBO at 45 hPa is in its westerly (easterly) phase, respectively. 12 \nAt mid-latitudes, they observed the opposite correlations.  Their recent studies show 13 \nsuch QBO phase dependent correlation is generally true in both hemispheres and for 14 \nall-year-round data [Labitzke, 2004; Labitzke and van Loon, 2000; van Loon and 15 \nLabitzke, 1998].  More recently, Salby and Callaghan [2006] confirmed those earlier 16 \nfindings that enhanced correlations are obtained if the data are sampled at around 17 \nsolstice (February \/ August) and grouped into QBO easterly\/westerly phases.  18 \nThe evidence in the literature suggests that the solar influences on the atmosphere are 19 \nof multiple sources and may have more than one pathway.  Nevertheless, no study has 20 \nyet been taken to evaluate the relative contribution of solar irradiance and 21 \ngeomagnetic activity. Previous studies all concentrated on only one form of solar 22 \nforcing and the atmospheric responses to solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity 23 \nwere investigated in isolation.  Differences in data, analytical methods, and time 24 \nscales and period, etc make it impossible to assess the relative influences of solar 25 \n 8\nirradiance and geomagnetic activity directly from those previous studies.  One 1 \nprimary objective of this paper is to examine the difference and relative influences of 2 \nsolar irradiance and geomagnetic activity on the Earth\u2019s climate using the same 3 \natmospheric data, with the same evaluation criteria and analytical methods.  4 \nThis study represents a first step towards understanding multiple solar influences on 5 \nthe atmospheric temperature. It builds on those earlier works and is novel and 6 \ndistinctive in three respects. Firstly, by using a newly-available radiosonde-based 7 \nglobal coverage of temperature anomaly (Ta ) (see section 2 for details), we assess the 8 \nrelative effects of solar irradiance (Fs) and geomagnetic activity Ap on the global 9 \ntemperature anomaly from 1000 hPa to 30 hPa by detecting their signatures in Ta 10 \nusing linear correlation and composite analysis. Secondly, we test if the correlations 11 \nare significant and the patterns are stable by using different filtering windows and 12 \ndifferent time periods. Thirdly, we study, at the inter-annual time scale, the mutual-13 \nmodulation relationships among QBO, solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity by 14 \nsub-sampling the data according to the phases of QBO, the strength of solar irradiance 15 \nand the level of geomagnetic activity, respectively. There are two underlying 16 \nhypotheses for the entire paper. That is, the quasi-decadal variations (QDVs) found in 17 \nthe previous literature are the results of multiple solar forcing; and the atmospheric 18 \nresponses to the solar influences may be modulated by the stratospheric QBO and can 19 \nbe treated piece-wise-linearly in terms of the intensity of solar irradiance and 20 \ngeomagnetic activity.  21 \n2.  The Data and Methods 22 \nFour major data sets are used in this study. Solar irradiance appears concurrently in 23 \nthe TSI and the UV irradiance, though solar UV irradiance may intrinsically have 24 \n 9\nmuch larger amplitude of variation in the interannual to decadal time scales than TSI 1 \n[Lean et al., 1997]. Solar irradiance was not directly measured for the entire period 2 \nfrom 1958 to 2001, so a suitable proxy was used, i.e., the 10.7-cm solar radio flux (Fs) 3 \nis employed [Hinteregger, 1981]. It is known that Fs originates from atmospheric 4 \nlayers high in the Sun\u2019s chromosphere and low in its corona, and responds primarily 5 \nto changes in the solar faculae that are mainly responsible for emitting the UV 6 \nradiation [Lean, 1991]. In general, high\/low Fs corresponds to solar maximum\/ 7 \nminimum conditions, respectively. The monthly averaged Fs are downloaded from the 8 \nNational Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) website (www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/stp\/SOLAR). It is 9 \nworth noting that though solar UV irradiance may be more effective in generating and 10 \nmodulating responses on interannual to decadal time scales, the multidecadal and 11 \nlonger-term response in earth\u2019s atmosphere are more likely associated with the 12 \npersistent forcing by TSI. However, either Fs or the 44-years of temperature anomaly 13 \ndata used here cannot capture those longer-term responses.  14 \nThe Ap index is a measure of geomagnetic storm activity over the globe [Mayaud, 15 \n1980]. It is derived from measurements made at a number of stations world-wide of 16 \nthe variation of the geomagnetic field due to currents flowing in the earth's 17 \nionosphere. It measures the energy deposited in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere by 18 \ncharged particle bombardment induced by the solar wind, and is largely affected by 19 \nthe variations in solar plasma flux, which affects the solar wind as well as 20 \ninterplanetary magnetic field parameters. The Ap index is found to be highly 21 \ncorrelated with solar wind velocity and low Ap values indicate a quiescent 22 \ninterplanetary medium as well as low solar wind speed [Garrett et al., 1974]. Large 23 \nAp values are often associated with an increase in the number of coronal holes that 24 \nproduce an unrestricted outward flow of solar plasma into interplanetary space and a 25 \n 10\nsubsequent disturbance to the Earth's magnetic field [Sheeley et al., 1976]. 1 \nGeomagnetic activity tends to peak during the descending phase of solar cycles when 2 \nthe high-speed solar wind streams are highly recurrent and most intense [Vennerstrom 3 \nand Friis-Christensen, 1996]. Studies have suggested that the Ap index is a good 4 \nindicator of upper atmospheric EPP [Randall et al., 1998]. Siskind et al.[2000] 5 \nexamined the year-to-year NOx variability of the total column inside the SH 6 \nstratospheric vortex. These authors found that, while month-to-month correlation is 7 \npoor, the average column NOx inside the vortex during May to August for 1991-1996 8 \nis well correlated to 4-month averaged Ap index. Studies have also suggested that this 9 \nis due to an accumulative effect of low energy particle precipitation generated by 10 \nsmaller, but more continuous geomagnetic storms occurring primarily in the 11 \nthermosphere [Clilverd et al., 2006; Orsolini et al., 2005; Randall et al., 2005]. The 12 \ntime required for the NOx to descend from the thermosphere to the stratosphere is, 13 \nthus, in the order of 1-3 months, sometimes even longer. Other processes such as solar 14 \nproton events which produce strong impulsive ionization episodes and are able to 15 \ndirectly penetrate into the stratosphere can also be considered as a cause of the 16 \nstratospheric high-altitude NOx [Jackman and McPeters, 2004]. However, such very 17 \nenergetic events are few and should not be considered as a dominant source for 18 \nstratospheric NOx enrichment [Lean et al., 1997; Solomon et al., 1982].  To account 19 \nfor the delayed response to geomagnetic activity, for all the case studies presented 20 \nhere, a 2-month forward lag is applied to the Ap index. The lagged time series is 21 \ndenoted as Ap and used throughout the paper. There are still large uncertainties in 22 \nidentifying the causes and the precise source regions of the stratospheric descent of 23 \nNOx and the 2-month forward lag applied to the Ap index may not represent the 24 \nprecise time lag for stratospheric NOx caused by geomagnetic activity. Nevertheless, 25 \n 11\nsuch a time lag is adequate for the inter-annual to inter-decadal time scales under 1 \ninvestigation. The monthly averaged Ap index is available from 1932 to the present 2 \ntime and is downloaded from the National Geophysical Data Center website.  3 \nFigure 1 shows the time series of monthly mean Fs and Ap. It shows, Ap peaks at 4 \ndifferent times in comparison to that of Fs. The first Ap peak often occurs slightly 5 \nbefore solar maximum, while the second and more intense peak occurs during the 6 \ndeclining phase of Fs. in comparison to Fs, the temporal variation of Ap is more rapid.  7 \n[Insert Figure 1 here]            8 \nRadiosonde observations of stratospheric equatorial winds are available monthly since 9 \n1956 at 7 pressure levels from 70 to 10 hPa [Naujokat, 1986]. The magnitude of 10 \ncorrelations involving extra-tropical fields depends on the exact level chosen to define 11 \nthe QBO. In the northern hemisphere (NH), the strongest extratropical signals were 12 \nobtained using a level near 40\u221250 hPa; while the magnitude of the southern 13 \nhemisphere (SH) response appears to be maximized using 20\u221230 hPa [Baldwin and 14 \nDunkerton, 1998]. In this study, the QBO phases were determined by the direction of 15 \nthe averaged zonal wind at 40 to 50 hPa. There is, therefore, a bias towards the NH.  16 \nThe temperature anomaly data set we used is the zonally averaged Ta (relative to the 17 \nmonthly 1966-95 climatology) from the Hadley Centre referred to as HadAT2. This is 18 \na recent analysis of the global upper air temperature record from 1958 to present 19 \nbased upon radiosonde data alone [Thorne et al., 2005]. The source data set consists 20 \nof 676 pre-selected radiosonde stations, which were quality controlled to ensure that 21 \nboth spatial and temporal consistencies are maintained. Though the data have missing 22 \nvalues in the SH and a bias towards NH mid-latitudes, it is probably one of the most 23 \n 12\nreliable temperature anomaly measurements available [Thorne et al., 2005]. The 1 \nmonthly data are available on a 5\u00b0 latitude resolution at nine separate pressure levels 2 \n(850, 700, 500, 300, 200, 150, 100, 50, and 30hPa). The HadAT2 is merged with the 3 \nmonthly, zonal averaged surface temperature anomaly from HadCRUT2V 4 \n(http:\/\/www.cru.uea.ac.uk\/cru\/data\/temperature\/) sub-sampled to the same period to represent 5 \n1000 hPa data. A common time period shared by these four data sets (i.e. Fs, Ap, 6 \nQBO, and Ta) is from Jan. 1958 to Dec. 2004, thus covering 4 solar cycles.  7 \nTo understand the mutual-modulating effects among solar irradiance, geomagnetic 8 \nactivity and the QBO, the monthly data are sub-sampled according to the phases of 9 \nQBO (i.e. westerly or easterly) and the phases of solar irradiance (i.e. high or low Fs), 10 \nor the levels of geomagnetic activity (i.e. high or low Ap), respectively. We use the 11 \nnormalized time series of QBO, Fs and Ap to define those phases and the same 12 \nthreshold value of 0.15 is applied for all three normalized time series. That is,  QBO  < 13 \n\u22120.15, QBO  > 0.15 sF  < \u22120.15, sF  >  0.15,  pA  < \u22120.15,  and pA  >  0.15 defines 14 \neasterly QBO, westerly QBO, low solar irradiance, high solar irradiance, low 15 \ngeomagnetic activity, and high geomagnetic activity, respectively, where QBO ,  sF  16 \nand pA  are normalized values of QBO,  Fs and Ap. For a given sample, the signals of 17 \nthe QBO, Fs, and Ap are studied by performing linear correlations between those three 18 \nnormalized time series and Ta, respectively. We check if the correlations are stable by 19 \nsampling data from different periods. In brief, we call a correlation pattern robust if: 20 \nthe correlations are statistically significant at a confidence level 95% or above; the 21 \nspatial pattern covers 10\u00b0 in latitude continuously (i.e. two horizontal grid points) or 22 \nabove; and is stable for different periods.  23 \n 13\nTo investigate how the correlation pattern may vary with time scales, recursive fixed 1 \ninterval smoothing, based on an integrated random walk plus noise model for signal 2 \nanalysis [Young et al., 1991], is used as either a low-pass or  high-pass filter. Two 3 \ntypes of high-pass filter are used to remove the long-term trends. One is the Integrated 4 \nRandom Walk SMoothing and decimation  method (IRWSM) available in the 5 \nCAPTAIN Toolbox [Young et al., 2004]. Another is a piece-wise linear model with 6 \nthe breaking points pre-defined at the months of three major volcanic eruptions (Mt. 7 \nAgung in March 1963, El Chich\u00f3n in April 1982, and Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991, 8 \nwhen temperatures rise abruptly), or 2-years following the eruption (in cases where 9 \nobservations for the three 2-year periods following major volcanic eruptions are 10 \nexcluded). The IRWSM method allows the user to define the cutoff period, so it is 11 \nused as a low pass filter as well. A 50-year cutoff period is applied to the IRWSM 12 \nmethod for the cases when the two years following the major volcanic eruptions are 13 \nincluded, while the piecewise linear model is applied to the cases when the years 14 \naffected by the major volcanic eruptions are excluded. We choose not to use the 15 \nsimple linear detrending; this is because the Ta time series are non-stationary, show 16 \nabruptly temperature rises due to the major volcanic eruptions, and encompass non-17 \nlinear trends. Seidel and Lanzante [2004] demonstrated that simple linear detrending 18 \nmay over-estimate the amount of temperature changes associated with the long-term 19 \ntrends, and the sloped steps and piecewise linear models which account for abrupt 20 \nchanges offer a better fit to the observations. The detrending method used by this 21 \nstudy is an alternative but essentially similar method to those used by Seidel and 22 \nLanzante [2004]. 23 \nGiven the high degree of serial correlation in the low-pass filtered time-series, we use 24 \nthe non-parametric test of Ebisuzaki [1997]. The method is based on random phase 25 \n 14\ntest of one of the time series in the frequency domain thus preserving its power 1 \nspectrum characteristics. For each pair of time series to be correlated, 10,000 synthetic 2 \nrandom time series having the same power spectrum as one of the original time-series 3 \n(e.g. Fs, Ap or QBO) and correlated them with the other original time-series (i.e. 4 \ntemperature anomaly Ta). The linear correlation coefficients are ordered in ascending 5 \norder and a distribution of correlation is constructed. This distribution of correlations 6 \nwas compared to the original correlation and used to determine the significance levels, 7 \ne.g., the upper 5% tail gives the one-tailed 5% level of significance. 8 \nSerial correlation is not a serious issue for the monthly temperature anomaly (Ta) time 9 \nseries as low-pass filters are not applied for the composite analysis. However, the 10 \nassumptions of normality and equal variances, required by the standard two-sample t-11 \ntest, can hardly be satisfied by all the Ta time series.  In this case, the significance 12 \nlevel for the difference between the mean values of two composite sub-samples is 13 \nestimated using a Monte Carlo trial based non-parametric test. The procedure is to 14 \nselect two sub-samples from the original time series with the lengths equal to the two 15 \ncomposite sub-samples and then the difference between their mean values is 16 \ncomputed. This procedure is repeated 10,000 times and a distribution of the 17 \ndifferences is constructed. The composite difference is then compared to this 18 \ndifference distribution and the rank of the actual difference among these randomized 19 \ntrials determines its significance level.  20 \nThe significance levels calculated using the non-parametric test of Ebisuzaki [1997] 21 \nand Monte Carlo trials are compared to those using the standard t-tests and using the 22 \nmethod of Davis [1976], which based on the concept of Effective Sample Size (ESS). 23 \nWe found that the t-tests give much more liberal significance levels than those where 24 \n 15\nnon-parametric tests were used. The method of Davis [1976] produces comparable 1 \nresults to those from the non-parametric tests, but only if the number of the lags used 2 \nfor calculating cross-correlations is set as around 60 months (equivalent to 5 years). 3 \nAs pointed out by Thiebaux and Zwiers [1984], we found that the ESS required by the 4 \nmethod of Davis [1976] cannot be estimated consistently as its values largely depend 5 \non the number of the lags used. Using the same value for the number of the lags for 6 \nthe correlation analyses for both Fs and Ap time series may not be physically 7 \njustifiable.  For these reasons, we have chosen to use the non-parametric tests. 8 \n3. Results  9 \n3.1 Correlation with Solar Irradiance and Geomagnetic Activity 10 \nOne major difficulty of separating solar irradiance and geomagnetic signals is that the 11 \ntime series of Fs and Ap are not orthogonal but positively correlated to each other. This 12 \nprevents a direct use of some common techniques, such as multiple linear regressions. 13 \nAs is shown in Table 1, their correlation coefficient (r) is stronger for some periods 14 \nand weaker for others. It shows that r tends to increase with the cutoff period of the 15 \ntemporal filter as well. We found that the lowest correlation occurs during Jan.1968 to 16 \nDec. 2004 and the highest correlation occurs during Jan. 1958 to Dec. 2001. Low r 17 \nvalues between Fs and Ap may provide a better chance to separate the long-term 18 \neffects of solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity. In addition, previous studies 19 \nfound that the radiosonde data are sparse and less reliable in the tropics and in the SH 20 \nprior to 1968 [Labitzke et al., 2002; Salby and Callaghan, 2006]. For these reasons, 21 \nthe results reported below are primarily based upon the period from Jan. 1968 to Dec. 22 \n2004. 23 \n[Insert Table 1 here] 24 \n 16\nFigure 2 shows the correlation maps between Fs and Ta in vertical meridional cross 1 \nsection under six different temporal filtering conditions using all the monthly data 2 \nfrom Jan. 1968 to Dec. 2004. In Figure 2a, the correlations are calculated without any 3 \ndetrending or smoothing. Positive solar signals are found in the tropospheric equator 4 \nto middle latitudes with rmax = 0.3 (at 40\u00b0S, 700 hPa). While the correlation 5 \ncoefficients are smaller, they are statistically significant with a confidence level above 6 \n95%, in the region around from 40 \u2212 60\u00b0, 300 \u2212 850 hPa in both hemispheres. Weak, 7 \nstatistically non-significant correlations are found in the subtropics of the stratosphere 8 \n(~10 \u2212 30\u00b0, 30 hPa in both hemispheres). Figure 2b shows that, when Ta is detrended, 9 \nthe stratospheric Fs signals increase and become statistically significant in the 10 \nsubtropics, while the signals in the troposphere reduce slightly. Figure 2c shows that r 11 \nincreases 50% (from 0.3 to 0.45) when both Fs and Ta are low-pass filtered with a 12-12 \nmonth cutoff period. Figures 2(d\u2212f) show that r increases with the cutoff period of the 13 \nlow-pass filter and rmax = 0.82 is found at the centre of the SH Ferrell cell (\u221240\u00b0, 700 14 \nhPa) when the cutoff period is taken as 5 years. For all six cases, positive correlations 15 \npredominate, indicating a warmer atmosphere during solar maxima.  Figures 2(c;f) 16 \nsuggest that solar irradiance may contribute up to 15% of inter-annual variation of Ta 17 \nat mid-latitudes of the troposphere and may account for up to 60% of inter-decadal 18 \nvariation of Ta in the same regions, while 5 to 40% of inter-annual to inter-decadal 19 \nvariations of Ta can be accounted for in the sub-tropical stratosphere. However, it is 20 \nworth noting that, despite a large increase in r due to increases in the cutoff periods of 21 \nthe low-pass filter, the regions with confidence level above 95% can only be found 22 \naround the Ferrell cell of the NH.  23 \n[Insert Figure 2 here] 24 \n 17\nAs a sensitivity test, we performed the same correlation analysis as Figure 2 but using 1 \ndata from Jan. 1958 instead of Jan. 1968. The resulting correlation pattern (Figure 3) 2 \nbecomes less symmetric about the equator in both the troposphere and stratosphere, 3 \nwith slightly lower values of r found in the SH. This is likely to be because of poorer 4 \ndata quality and quantity in the SH prior to 1968. Because the number of samples has 5 \nincreased, larger than 95% confidence levels are able to be established over a much 6 \nbroader area of the troposphere. Confidence levels above 95% covers the entire 7 \nFerrell cells in both hemispheres and the edges of the Hadley cells. However, in the 8 \nstratosphere, the region with confidence levels above 95% remains virtually the same. 9 \nFurther sub-sampling analysis suggests that the Fs signals at mid-latitudes of the 10 \ntroposphere and in the subtropical stratosphere are rather robust while those in the 11 \ntropics are less stable. They become weaker if 1958\u22122001 data are used and even 12 \nnegative if only 1979\u22122001 data are employed. The unstable Fs signals in the tropical 13 \ntroposphere probably signify a strong influence of ENSO in this region.    14 \n           [Insert Figure 3 here]  15 \nFigure 4 illustrates an example of the temporal evolution of the correlations shown in 16 \nFigure 2. Figure 4a;b;c;d shows the time series of Fs, the monthly, zonally averaged 17 \nTa from the NH mid-latitude (35\u221255\u00b0N, 850 \u2013 300 hPa) and from the SH mid-latitude 18 \n(35\u221245\u00b0S, 850 \u2013 300 hPa) troposphere, detrended and smoothed Ta  from both sites 19 \nand the trends which are subtracted, respectively. Figure 4c shows that the amplitudes 20 \nof Ta are between 0.15 \u2212 0.35\u00b0C, with peaks \/ valleys approximately at maxima \/ 21 \nminima of the solar cycle, respectively. These changes reflect a gradual drift of the 22 \ntemperature anomaly that tracks Fs at time scales above ~5 years.  23 \n[Insert Figure 4 here] 24 \n 18\nFigure 5 shows the same as Figure 2, but for the correlations between Ap and Ta. 1 \nWithout smoothing or detrending (Figure 5a), weak but significant positive Ap signals 2 \nare found in the stratosphere, with the strongest Ap signal in the sub-tropical to mid-3 \nlatitudes of the SH stratosphere (20\u221240\u00b0, 30\u2212100 hPa) and in the Arctic stratosphere 4 \n(55\u221275\u00b0, 30\u221250 hPa). With detrending and increased size of filtering windows, both 5 \nthe correlation coefficient and confidence levels increase. Positive correlations cover 6 \nnearly the entire stratosphere when a 3 to 5-year cutoff period is applied (Figure 5e;f), 7 \nexcept for the Antarctic polar region where missing values of Ta  exist. The values of r 8 \nin those affected regions are in the range of 0.1\u22120.2 when no filtering is applied 9 \n(Figure 5a), and become as high as 0.84 when a 5-year cutoff period is applied (Figure 10 \n5f). In comparison to Figure 2 and 3, the correlations between Ap and Ta in 11 \nstratospheric regions are generally higher than those between Fs and Ta, generally 12 \nwith a confidence level of 95% or above, suggesting possible stronger geomagnetic 13 \ninfluence. Overall, positive correlations predominate, indicating that the stratosphere 14 \nis statistically warmer during the periods where geomagnetic activity is high. In terms 15 \nof the magnitude, the values of r suggest Ap may account for up to 10% of the inter-16 \nannual variation (Figure 5c) and up to 60% of the inter-decadal variation of Ta (Figure 17 \n5f) in these stratospheric regions, which is slightly higher than those accounted for by 18 \nFs (see Figures 2 and 3).  19 \n [Insert Figure 5 here] 20 \nAs a sensitivity test, we performed the same correlation analysis as Figure 5 but using 21 \ndata from Jan.1958. The results are shown in Figure 6. Although the general spatial 22 \npattern remains the same as that of Figure 5, the values of r and confidence levels 23 \nreduce considerably (by 30\u221250%).  As is shown in Table 1, during this extended time 24 \n 19\nperiod, the correlation between Ap and Fs is high. It is not clear why the correlation in 1 \nthe stratosphere is weakened rather than strengthened given the higher correlation 2 \nbetween Ap and Fs during this longer data period. By performing the same correlation 3 \nanalysis using other different starting \/ending times, a similar pattern emerges but 4 \nwith higher r and confidence values; this suggests the pattern shown in Figure 5 is 5 \nrelatively stable. Overall, the most robust Ap signals are the positive correlation 6 \nregions in the SH subtropical and the Arctic stratosphere.  7 \n[Insert Figure 6 here] 8 \n3.2 Effects of Trend and Volcano Eruptions using Composite Analysis 9 \nThe stratospheric subtropical Fs and Ap signals shown figures 2\u22126 are likely to be 10 \ncontaminated by the pronounced heating episodes associated with aerosol injections 11 \nfollowing volcanic eruptions.  With three major eruptions having taken place during 12 \n1958\u22122001, and two of them (El Chich\u00f3n and Mt. Pinatubo) occurred during the 13 \ndescending phase of the 11-year solar cycle, there is a chance to misattribute volcanic 14 \nsignals to solar irradiance or geomagnetic activity signals. To investigate such a 15 \npossibility, we carried out a composite analysis by both including and excluding the 16 \ndata during the 2-years following a major volcanic eruption. Possible influence of the 17 \nlong-term trends was also examined by both keeping and removing the trends.    18 \nFigure 7 shows the averaged temperature anomaly (Ta) differences between westerly 19 \nand easterly QBO (a1-a4), high and low solar irradiance (b1-b4), and high and low 20 \ngeomagnetic activity (c1-c4), respectively, using the data period from Jan. 1968 to 21 \nDec.2004. The analyses shown in the 1st and 3rd (or 2nd and 4th) rows include (or 22 \n 20\nexclude) the data during the 2-years following a major volcanic eruption, while those 1 \nshown the 1st and 2nd (or 3rd and 4th) rows also keep (or remove) the long-term trends. 2 \nStatistically significant Ta differences (\u0394Ta) between westerly and easterly QBO 3 \nappear predominantly in the stratosphere (see a1 to a4 of figure 7). The magnitudes of 4 \nTa differences are in the range of \u22121.2 to 1.5 K, which is the largest among the three 5 \nsignals (i.e. the QBO, Fs and Ap) examined and comparable to the interannaual 6 \nvariation of Ta [Salby and Callaghan, 2006]. Positive QBO signals are noticeable in 7 \nthe tropical upper troposphere to the lower stratosphere between 10\u00b0S to 10\u00b0N, 8 \n50\u2212200 hPa, and at mid-latitudes, where two positive regions near 30\u221250 hPa, one 9 \nlocated at ~20\u221260\u00b0N and another at ~20\u221240\u00b0S, are observed.  There are two negative 10 \nregions near the tropopause directly beneath those positive regions. The stratospheric 11 \nmid-latitude positive-negative regions are broadly symmetric across the equator and 12 \nsuch a pattern is known to be associated with the QBO-induced meridional circulation 13 \nin temperature [Crooks and Gray, 2005; Randel et al., 1999]. A strong negative 14 \nregime is apparent in the Arctic stratosphere, particularly when the Ta time series are 15 \nnot detrended (30\u2212300 hPa, see a1 and a2).  Detrending reduces the magnitude of \u0394Ta 16 \nin the stratosphere by \u223c 0.6 K in the tropics, ~ 0.8 K in the Arctic, and only ~ 0.1 K in 17 \nthe subtropics to mid-latitudes (comparing a3 to a1, and a4 to a2).  The temperature 18 \ndifferences increase slightly in magnitude overall (\u223c 0.1\u22120.2 K) if the data affected by 19 \nvolcanic eruptions are excluded (comparing a2 to a1, and a4 to a3). Detrending or 20 \nexcluding volcanic contamination causes little change in the confidence levels of the 21 \nQBO signals, thus in the general pattern of the QBO signals in Ta. 22 \nStatistically significant, positive Ta differences between high and low Fs appear in 23 \nboth the stratosphere and troposphere, and their spatial pattern is broadly symmetric 24 \n 21\nabout the equator (see b1 to b4 of figure 7). No Fs signal is visible in the polar regions. 1 \nThese features are consistent with those derived from linear correlation (see figures 2 2 \nand 3). The average Ta differences are in the range of 0.1\u22120.4 K at mid-latitudes in the 3 \ntroposphere, and in the range of 0.1\u22120.6 K in the stratospheric subtropics to mid-4 \nlatitudes. Detrending causes a measurable amount of \u0394Ta increase in the troposphere 5 \n(by ~ 0.1 K) and a negligible amount of \u0394Ta change in the stratosphere (comparing b3 6 \nto b1, and b2 to b4 in figure7).  Excluding the data contaminated by volcanic 7 \neruptions results in a measurable amount of \u0394Ta reduction in the stratosphere (by ~ 8 \n0.2 K) but no change of \u0394Ta in the troposphere (comparing b2 to b1, and b3 to b4 of 9 \nfigure7).  10 \nStatistically significant, positive Ta differences between high and low Ap appear in the 11 \nsubtropics to mid-latitudes and in the Arctic region of the stratosphere (see c1 to c4 of 12 \nfigure 7).  The temperature differences are in the range of 0.1\u22120.7 K, with the largest 13 \ntemperature difference found in the SH stratospheric subtropics to mid-latitudes (\u223c0.7 14 \nK). Such Ap signals are about 0.3\u22120.4 K smaller in the NH than their SH counterparts, 15 \nmaking the Ap signature in Ta asymmetric about the equator. Detrending halves the 16 \ntemperature difference in the Artic stratosphere (from 0.5\u22120.6 K to 0.2\u22120.3 K) and 17 \ncontributes less than 0.1 K increases in \u0394Ta in the NH sub-tropics to mid-latitudes 18 \n(comparing c3 to c1, and c2 to c4 of figure7).  Excluding the data contaminated by 19 \nvolcanic eruptions results in ~0.2 K reduction in \u0394Ta in the stratospheric sub-tropics 20 \nto mid-latitudes and 0.1 K in the Arctic stratosphere (comparing b2 to b1, and b3 to 21 \nb4 in figure7). 22 \nFigure 7 suggests that, in the lower stratosphere (50\u2212100 hPa), the effects of solar 23 \nirradiance and geomagnetic activity may be comparable to each other, particularly in 24 \n 22\nthe SH tropics to mid-latitudes, while at similar latitudes of the middle stratosphere 1 \n(30\u221250 hPa), the response to solar irradiance is larger. Such differences account for 2 \nabout 10\u221230% of the inter-annual variation of Ta in these stratospheric regions. In the 3 \nArctic middle stratosphere (60 \u221280\u00b0, 30 hPa), Ta differences between high and low Ap 4 \nare statistically significant and larger than those related to solar irradiance, suggesting 5 \nstronger geomagnetic influences in the polar region. In the troposphere, solar 6 \nirradiance alone accounts for about 10\u221230% of the inter-annual variation of Ta, while 7 \nthe Ta differences due to geomagnetic activity are much smaller (\u00b1 0.2 K at most). 8 \nThe tropospheric Ap signature (significant at a 95% confidence level) appears only in 9 \nthe Arctic, in the case where Ta is detrended and the data contaminated by volcanic 10 \neruptions are excluded.  Figure 7 also suggests that the contaminations caused by 11 \nvolcanic eruptions are relatively small, though they account for 0.1\u22120.2 K average 12 \n\u0394Ta increase in the stratosphere between high and low Fs  (or Ap).  Thus, the positive 13 \ntemperature anomalies resulting from volcanic eruptions do not change the general 14 \npatterns of solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity signals in Ta. While the long-15 \nterm trends may have stronger influence on the QBO and geomagnetic activity signals 16 \nin the NH polar regions, their influence in the extra-tropical regions and on Fs signals 17 \nis small.  18 \nThe results presented in this and previous sections suggest positive responses of the 19 \natmospheric temperature anomaly to both solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity. 20 \nThe primary responses to solar irradiance occur in the tropospheric middle latitudes 21 \nand the subtropical stratosphere, while geomagnetic activity responses occur mostly in 22 \nthe stratosphere. As figure 7 shows that the QBO accounts for the largest amount of 23 \ninter-annual variation in Ta, it is useful to examine how the Fs and Ap signals shown in 24 \n 23\nthis section will be redistributed according the equatorial QBO phases. To achieve this 1 \nand to reveal possible non-linear responses of Ta to solar irradiance and geomagnetic 2 \nactivity, the next section separates the data according to the phases of the QBO, solar 3 \nirradiance and geomagnetic activity.  4 \n3.3 Fs and Ap signals under different sub-sampling 5 \nTo represent the inter-annual variations, in the correlation analyses shown below, a 6 \n12-month cutoff period is applied to all time series involved. To focus on the 7 \ntemperature anomaly responses to solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity, the data 8 \nduring the 2-years following a major eruption are excluded. 9 \n3.3.1 Sub-sampling according to the QBO phases 10 \nFigure 8 shows the correlations between Fs and Ta (the 1st row), and Ap and Ta (the 2nd 11 \nrow), for all data (the 1st column), when the QBO is westerly (the 2nd column), when 12 \nthe QBO is easterly (the 3rd column).   13 \nThe first row of Figure 8 shows that Fs signals mostly appear in the middle latitude 14 \ntroposphere and the subtropical stratosphere when all the data are used. When the data 15 \nare sub-sampled according to the phases of the QBO, Fs signals switch between the 16 \nstratosphere and the troposphere depending on the QBO phases. In the troposphere, Fs 17 \nsignals are stronger (or weaker) when the QBO is westerly (or easterly); in the 18 \nstratosphere, the opposite holds.  In the troposphere, mid-latitude Fs signals associated 19 \nwith the westerly phase of the QBO are robust (rmax = 0.54, statistically significant at 20 \nthe 95% confidence level). Further analysis suggests that these tropospheric signals 21 \ndominate in the months of June to August (not shown). In the stratosphere, subtropical 22 \nto mid-latitudes Fs signals associated with the easterly QBO is highly robust (rmax = 23 \n 24\n0.57, statistically significant at the 99% confidence level). These Fs signals appear 1 \nslightly stronger in the NH than in the SH, but can be stated as broadly symmetry 2 \nabout the equator. In the NH polar region, no robust Fs signals are detected.  3 \nThe second row of Figure 8 shows that the overall Ap signature is asymmetric about 4 \nthe equator; stronger signals detected in the SH than in the NH. When all the data are 5 \nincluded, the signals primarily appear in the SH subtropical to mid-latitude lower 6 \nstratosphere, and in the Arctic stratosphere. In comparison to Fs signals, the Ap signals 7 \nare modulated by the phases of the QBO in a quite different way. Robust Ap signals 8 \nare mostly found in the subtropical stratosphere for the westerly QBO phase, and Ap 9 \nsignals remain stronger in the SH than the NH. When the QBO is westerly, Ap signals 10 \nin the NH stratosphere appear in the region of  5\u221220\u00b0, 30\u221250 hPa and extend 11 \npolewards and downwards in the region of 0\u221240\u00b0, 50\u2212200 hPa, while, in the SH 12 \nstratosphere, the signals appear in the region of 10\u221250\u00b0, 30\u2212100 hPa. In the 13 \ntroposphere, however, no Ap signal can be found. When the QBO is easterly, weaker 14 \nand isolated positive Ap signals appear in the lower stratospheric tropics, while 15 \nnegative Ap signals appears in the SH mid-latitude troposphere. Indistinguishable 16 \npositive Ap signals in the Arctic stratosphere are found for both westerly and easterly 17 \nQBO phases. 18 \n[Insert Figure 8 here] 19 \n3.3.2 Sub-sampling according to the intensity of Fs 20 \nFigure 9 shows the correlations between the QBO and Ta (the 1st row), and Ap and Ta 21 \n(the 2nd row), for all data (the 1st column), when Fs  is high (the 2nd column), and when 22 \nFs is low (the 3rd column).   23 \n 25\nThe first row of Figure 9 shows that slightly stronger positive and negative QBO 1 \nsignals are found when Fs  is low than those when Fs  is high. When Fs is low, 2 \nenhanced positive QBO signals are found in the equatorial to mid-latitude stratosphere 3 \nand negative QBO to Ta correlations are found in the Arctic stratosphere. By 4 \nperforming the same correlation analysis using different periods, we found that these 5 \nsolar irradiance-dependent QBO correlation patterns are rather robust. That is, slightly 6 \nstronger QBO signals tend to appear when Fs is low. 7 \n[Insert Figure 9 here] 8 \nThe second row of Figure 9 shows that the effects of solar irradiance on Ap signals in 9 \nTa. When all data are included, similar to those shown in the 3rd column of figure 7, 10 \nthe Ap signals are asymmetric about the equator, primarily appearing in the SH 11 \nstratospheric subtropics to mid-latitudes, and in the Arctic stratosphere. When Fs is 12 \nhigh, Ap signals in the stratospheric subtropics and mid-latitudes are enhanced and 13 \nbecome symmetric about the equator (rmax = 0.49, significant at a 99% confidence 14 \nlevel). This indicates that up to 23% of inter-annual variation of Ta in the region can 15 \nbe explained by the variation of Ap during the years when solar irradiance is high. 16 \nWeaker but robust negative Ap signals are found in the troposphere (20\u221230\u00b0, 17 \n200\u22121000 hPa), located directly under those positive signals, implying negative 18 \ninfluence of geomagnetic activity on the Hadley circulation. When Fs is low, positive 19 \nAp signals appear in the Arctic stratosphere with rmax = 0.43, accompanied by negative 20 \nAp signals at mid-latitudes in the stratosphere with rmin = 0.35, suggesting a warmer 21 \nthan average Arctic stratosphere is accompanied by a cooler than average counterpart 22 \nin the stratospheric mid-latitudes. Ap signals in the tropical and subtropical 23 \nstratosphere are weak and no Ap signal can be found in the troposphere.   24 \n 26\n3.3.3 Sub-sampling according to the Geomagnetic Ap index 1 \nFigure 10 shows the correlations between the QBO and Ta (the 1st row), and Fs and Ta 2 \n(the 2nd row), for all data (the 1st column), when Ap is high (the 2nd column), and when 3 \nAp is low (the 3rd column).  4 \n[Insert Figure 10 here] 5 \nThe first row of Figure 10 shows that stronger QBO signals are associated with low 6 \ngeomagnetic activity, notably at the lower stratospheric tropics and the stratospheric 7 \nmid-latitudes. In the Arctic stratosphere, the correlation coefficients are approximately 8 \nequal (\u22120.35) for all three cases: all data, when Ap is high and when Ap is low. In the 9 \ntroposphere, statistically significant (at a 95% confidence level and above) positive 10 \nQBO signals are found at the centre of the SH Ferrell cell (40\u00b0S) and negative QBO 11 \nsignals are found directly above, only when Ap is high.  12 \nThe second row of Figure 10 shows that the spatial patterns of the correlations remain 13 \nsymmetric about the equator in the both stratosphere and troposphere for all three 14 \ncases: all data, when Ap is high and when Ap is low. When Ap  is high, enhanced Fs 15 \nsignals appear in the stratospheric subtropics with r values increased by 20 \u2212 30% and 16 \nthe confidence levels increased from 95% to 99%. Such behavior of the Fs signature is 17 \nsomehow similar to the case when the data were sub-sampled according to the QBO 18 \nphases (see 1st row of figure 8). In the troposphere, however, the Fs siganls are found 19 \nin the poleward part of the Ferrell cells when Ap is high, and between the Hadley cells 20 \nand the Ferrell cells, when Ap is low. Thus, the primary regions of Ta responses to Fs 21 \nin the troposphere tend to shift towards the equator when Ap is low and towards the 22 \npoles when Ap is high.  23 \n 27\n4. Discussions 1 \nThere are two reasons that we chose to apply simple correlation and composite 2 \nanalysis rather than multi-linear regression (MLR). Firstly, Fs and Ap are correlated to 3 \neach other, as shown in Table 1, while MLR requires that the regressing time series 4 \nare not (or at least are only weakly) correlated to each other.  Secondly, although 5 \nMLR may have the advantage of handling multiple variables, it remains hard to 6 \nguarantee that the variables used can actually account for all the influential processes. 7 \nFailure to account for other variables or processes can potentially lead to wrong 8 \ninterpretations, as the predicted responses to the recognized variables are the results of 9 \nthe proposed multi-linear model, which may not necessarily represent the true 10 \nphysical processes. In particular, if the governing processes are non-linear, a MLR 11 \nmodel with many variables included can be worse than a simple one as there are many 12 \ndegrees of freedom to fit the data. 13 \nThe influences of solar irradiance are mostly positive in both the stratosphere and 14 \ntroposphere, and the signals are robust in the tropospheric mid-latitudes and in the 15 \nstratospheric subtropics. In the troposphere, the locations of the mid-latitude positive 16 \nFs signals are in good agreement with the findings of Haigh [2003], Crooks and Gray 17 \n[2005] and Gleisner and Thejll [2003], but differ from those of Salby and Callaghan 18 \n[2006], who used NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis and found almost no response in the same 19 \nregions. We have found that most of the warming signal associated with Fs in the 20 \ntroposphere lies on the poleward side of the Ferrell cells, suggesting a weakening of 21 \nits upward branch. This is consistent with the findings of Gleisner and Thejll [2003] 22 \nand Haigh [2003] where the NCEP\/NCAR re-analysis was used. The magnitude of 23 \ntemperature responses associated with Fs (\u223c0.4 K), however, are larger than GCM 24 \n 28\nsimulations using an observed solar energy spectrum and the associated ozone 1 \nchanges (~0.1 K) [Haigh, 1999a; Shindell et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 2001]. Sub-2 \nsampling further suggests that solar irradiance signals are broadly symmetry about the 3 \nequator and tend to migrate around the Ferrell cells and the poleward part of the 4 \nHadley cells. These observations agree well with recent observational findings of 5 \nSalby and Callaghan [2006], and support the previously proposed connection between 6 \nsolar irradiance and temperature differences between solar maximum and minimum 7 \nyears. Labitzke [2001] suggested that the positive temperature differences between 8 \nsolar maximum and minimum years could be explained to some extent by an 9 \nintensified Hadley circulation, i.e. intensified downward motion in the upper 10 \ntroposphere during solar maximum. 11 \nIn the stratosphere, the locations of the positive signals in the subtropics of each 12 \nhemisphere at around 10\u00b0\u221230\u00b0 and 30\u2212100 hPa agree with those of Crooks and Gray 13 \n[2005], Hood [2004] and Salby and Callaghan [2006]. However, a negative 14 \ntemperature response to Fs was found at high latitudes of both hemispheres by Crooks 15 \nand Gray [2005] and Keckhut et al. [2005], while Hood [2004] and Scaife et al. 16 \n[2000] reported positive responses in the same regions. Here, we found no statistically 17 \nsignificant temperature responses to Fs at high latitudes, agreeing with Salby and 18 \nCallaghan [2006]. In terms of the magnitude of the temperature responses, \u223c0.5 K 19 \nincreases are detected by this study (see figure 7), which is comparable to the findings 20 \nof Hood [2004], Keckhut et al. [2005] and Salby and Callaghan [2006], but slightly 21 \nsmaller than that detected by Crooks and Gray [2005]. Crooks and Gray [2005] used 22 \nERA-40 reanalysis for the period of 1979\u22122001 and found \u223c0.75 K increases in the 23 \nSH when two years following major volcanic eruptions are excluded from their linear 24 \nregression analysis. The responses found by this study are also smaller than those 25 \n 29\nstudies in which the composite analysis or correlations were performed based upon 1 \nsingle-calendar-month sampling at around solstice [Labitzke, 2001; Labitzke, 2003; 2 \nSalby and Callaghan, 2006].  Thus, these differences are largely due to either the 3 \ndifferent datasets used or the analysis methods employed. It is worth noting that, 4 \nalthough the magnitude of the temperature response is generally found to be larger in 5 \nthe stratosphere than that in the troposphere, a comparable amount of inter-annual to 6 \ninter-decadal variation in Ta  is accounted for by Fs because of the smaller inter-annual 7 \nvariation of Ta in the troposphere. 8 \nThe results of the QBO modulation on the Fs signature (Figure 8) are also in general 9 \nagreement with what has been reported by Labitzke [2003], who used only July and 10 \nAugust data from NCEP\/NCAR re-analysis (1968-2002). We confirm here that such 11 \nQBO modulated 11-year solar cycle signals are statistically significant at inter-annual 12 \ntime scales as well. 13 \nIn comparison to the temperature responses to solar irradiance, Ta responses to 14 \ngeomagnetic activity are primarily in the stratosphere, and such a signature is 15 \nasymmetry about the equator. Positive Ap signals are detected in the subtropics to 16 \nmid-latitudes with larger temperature responses in the SH than in the NH. Such Ap 17 \nsignals cannot be compared to previous studies as literally no work has been 18 \npublished in the area. 19 \nThe temperature anomaly in the stratosphere responds to both solar irradiance and 20 \ngeomagnetic activity positively, reflecting warmer conditions for the lower to middle 21 \nstratosphere and indicating anomalous upwelling of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. 22 \nIn the Arctic stratosphere, the responses to geomagnetic activity are robust and 23 \ndominate over the responses to solar irradiance. The sub-sampling (figures 9) shows 24 \n 30\nthat such an Ap signature is enhanced when solar irradiance is low. Our seasonal 1 \nanalysis (not shown) further suggests that the signature appears mostly during late 2 \nwinter and early spring, implying the important role of NOx descent from higher 3 \naltitudes during the winter to spring seasons. In terms of statistical significance, 4 \ngeomagnetic activity signals achieve higher confidence levels in general than those of 5 \nsolar irradiance in the stratosphere.  6 \nA high level of geomagnetic activity enhances solar irradiance signals in the 7 \nstratosphere and vice versa. Haigh [1996] argued that an increase in stratospheric 8 \ntemperature during solar maximum conditions leads to a strengthening of easterly 9 \nwinds, which penetrate into the tropical upper troposphere. The pronounced vertical 10 \nbipolar structure in Ta responses to Ap over the Arctic stratosphere (see figure 7c1-c4) 11 \nmay provide an additional clue for such mutual-enhancement in solar influences in the 12 \natmosphere. Modeling studies show that a similar vertical bipolar structure is 13 \nassociated with solar irradiance, and such bipolar structure seems to enhance easterly 14 \nwind anomaly in the NH extra-tropics [Egorova et al., 2004]. The vertical bipolar 15 \nstructure associated with geomagnetic activity may play an important role 16 \ndynamically by either reinforcing or blocking the Fs signature getting into the 17 \ntroposphere. Such a reinforcing \/blocking mechanism is also evident by the sub-18 \nsampling shown in the second rows of figures 8 and 9, in which negative influence of 19 \ngeomagnetic activity in the Hadley cells are found, primarily when the QBO is 20 \neasterly or Fs is high. Note that the sign of the Ap signals is opposite to that of the Fs 21 \nsignals in the same region of the Hadley cells, implying that the Hadley circulation 22 \nresponse to solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity is complex. The effects of solar 23 \nirradiance and geomagnetic activity may enhance or compensate each other, 24 \n 31\ndepending on the combined condition of atmospheric dynamics and relative intensity 1 \nof solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity. 2 \nIn the Arctic stratosphere, the signs of the Fs signals agree well with previous studies 3 \nregarding solar irradiance-QBO phase modulation [Labitzke, 1987; Labitzke and van 4 \nLoon, 1988; Salby and Callaghan, 2006], only if the sub-sampling is made seasonally 5 \n(not shown). For the winter period (Dec\u2212Feb), we found positive correlations between 6 \nFs and Ta during the westerly QBO phase with rmax = 0.33 at 60\u00b0N, 50 hPa. The 7 \ncorrelations are statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Opposite 8 \ncorrelations between Fs and Ta are found for the easterly QBO phase with rmax = \u22120.34 9 \nat 70 \u00b0N, 200 hPa, but the correlations are not statistically significant at a 95% 10 \nconfidence level. The weaker correlations found by this study are most likely due 11 \neither to the sampling methods, to the different filters used, or to data quality. 12 \nNevertheless, these results may also suggest that considerable intra-seasonal 13 \nvariations exist in the Arctic stratosphere. In the subtropical stratosphere, the positive 14 \nFs signals associated during easterly QBO are highly robust, but the correlation 15 \ncoefficients are considerably smaller than those from studies in which the correlations 16 \nwere performed based upon single-calendar-month sampling around the solstices 17 \n[Labitzke, 2003; 2004].  18 \nThe combined effects of radiative heating at the tropics and mid-latitudes and O3 19 \ndepletion at the higher latitudes seem to produce a stronger, cross-hemisphere 20 \nanomalous dynamical response, consequently, more symmetric patterns of both Fs and 21 \nAp signals. The changing spatial patterns of Fs and Ap signals according to the QBO 22 \nphase further imply the important role of dynamical coupling. Nevertheless, the 23 \nmechanisms associated with the observed subtropical to mid-latitude stratospheric Fs 24 \n 32\nand Ap signals are not very clear. It is known that an increase of UV irradiance causes 1 \na higher rate of photochemical O3 production in the stratospheric tropics and mid-2 \nlatitudes. This increased ozone concentration causes higher radiative heating and 3 \nhence higher temperature, primarily in the upper stratospheric lower latitudes [Gray et 4 \nal., 2005; Hood, 2004]. The direct temperature responses to the UV-O3 photochemical 5 \nprocesses in the lower stratosphere, however, are relatively small and cannot explain 6 \nthe observed solar signals in the lower stratosphere. Kodera and Kuroda [2002] 7 \nattributed such Fs signals to dynamical responses and proposed a plausible 8 \nmechanism.  9 \nAnother puzzle is that, although cooling rather than warming is expected to 10 \naccompany O3 depletions by the descending NOx (through catalytic reactions), Ap 11 \nsignals revealed by our statistical inferences here are mostly positive. If these positive 12 \nAp signals in the subtropics and the Arctic of the lower to mid-stratosphere are an 13 \nindication of physical processes, they are likely due to indirect or dynamical 14 \nresponses, as suggested by a recent model study [Rozanov et al., 2005]. The following 15 \nmechanisms may be speculated for the mutual enhancement of the Fs and Ap signals 16 \nin the stratosphere subtropics. High geomagnetic activity enhances NOx productions 17 \nin the thermosphere and mesosphere. In the presence of strong polar vortex 18 \nconditions, NOx descends and depletes O3 primarily at high latitudes of the upper 19 \nstratosphere [Solomon et al., 1982]. Observational studies suggest stronger polar night 20 \njet tends to occur during winter under solar maximum conditions [Kodera, 1995; 21 \nKuroda and Kodera, 2002]. This provides an optimal condition for NOx to descend; 22 \nthus larger Ap signals are expected under solar maximum conditions. An increase of 23 \nUV also leads to increases of equatorial upper stratospheric ozone and radiative 24 \nheating, and produces, through the thermal wind relationship, an enhancement of the 25 \n 33\nzonal wind in the subtropics of the winter hemisphere [Kodera and Kuroda, 2002]. A 1 \npossible dynamical feedback is that high latitudes O3 depletion caused by the descent 2 \nof NOx may act as an enhancement mechanism for the initial solar-UV-induced zonal 3 \nwind anomaly in the subtropical upper stratosphere to propagate downward and 4 \npoleward during winter. As proposed by Kodera and Kuroda [2002], a dynamical 5 \nconsequence of wind anomaly propagation is that upward propagating planetary 6 \nwaves are deflected poleward, decreasing planetary wave absorption. The reduced 7 \nwave absorption in the extratropical upper stratosphere then induces an equatorward 8 \nanomaly in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. This, in turn, produces a warmer than 9 \naverage anomaly in the tropical lower stratosphere, as statistically inferred by this 10 \nstudy. Nevertheless, the complex dynamical-chemistry coupling cannot be revealed 11 \nby the HadAT temperature anomaly data, which only cover the troposphere to the 12 \nmiddle stratosphere, or by the simple statistical inference using here. Data covering 13 \nthe upper stratosphere and GCM experiments are inevitably required to clarify and 14 \ntest the precise mechanisms involved. It is worth noting that most of the middle-15 \natmospheric GCMs do not consider the effects of geomagnetic activity. This could be 16 \na reason for disagreement between the GCM simulations and the observations 17 \nregarding weaker solar signals in the SH and misrepresentation of the lower 18 \nstratospheric warming in the tropics. Since planetary wave activity plays a major role 19 \nin stratospheric dynamics and is most pronounced during NH winter period, it would 20 \nbe interesting to carry out a detailed analysis for winter seasons. Such an analysis has 21 \nbeen carried out using ERA-40 reanalysis and the results are reported elsewhere. 22 \nThe results reported here suggest an alternative interpretation of the solar-QBO 23 \nrelationship. Driven primarily by wave-mean flow interaction, Ta may be strongly 24 \ninfluenced by both the QBO and Quasi-decadal variations (QDVs). The QDVs 25 \n 34\npreviously found in the literature may be due to the combined effects of solar 1 \nirradiance (Fs) and geomagnetic activity (Ap), which, in turn, depends on solar 2 \nmagnetic flux.  Further study is needed to understand how such multiple solar-related 3 \ninfluences could be linked to the \u201cdownward and poleward control\u201d mechanism 4 \n[Kodera and Kuroda, 2002; Kodera et al., 1990; Matthes et al., 2004] and the 5 \ndynamical coupling in the upper stratosphere between the tropics and the polar 6 \nregions [Gray et al., 2001].  7 \n5. Conclusions  8 \nThe significant stratospheric Fs and Ap signals found in the radiosonde-based HadAT2 9 \ntemperature anomaly data provide additional evidence to support the previously 10 \nprescribed solar irradiance-QBO interaction [Labitzke, 1987; Labitzke, 2003; Labitzke 11 \nand van Loon, 1988; Salby and Callaghan, 2006]. In this study, using linear 12 \ncorrelation and composite analysis, we have examined the influences of solar 13 \nirradiance and geomagnetic activity on the stratospheric and tropospheric temperature 14 \nanomaly and their relative importance. Geomagnetic Ap signals are found primarily in 15 \nthe stratosphere, while solar irradiance signals are found in both the stratosphere and 16 \ntroposphere. Statistically, the difference between Fs and Ap signals is shown more 17 \nclearly during the period when the correlations between Fs and Ap are relative low 18 \n(Jan. 1968 \u2212 Dec. 2004). In terms of correlation coefficients, for the period from Jan. 19 \n1958 to Dec. 2004, the Fs signals are more stable than the Ap signals.  In the 20 \nsubtropical to mid-latitude stratosphere, the influences of Fs and Ap are comparable in 21 \nmagnitude, particularly in the SH, while the confidence levels of Ap signals are higher 22 \nthan those of Fs.  In the Arctic stratosphere, Ta shows a larger and more significant 23 \npositive response to geomagnetic activity than to solar irradiance.  24 \n 35\nTemporal filtering has a large influence on the correlation coefficients. However, it 1 \nhas far less influence on the confidence levels. While r values may increase from 0.3 2 \nto 0.8 with an increase in the cut-off period applied for the low-pass filter, the regions 3 \nwhere the correlation coefficients have confidence levels above 95% remain largely 4 \nunchanged. Thus, caution is required when one quantifies solar influences based upon 5 \nthe correlation coefficients alone. The robustness of the signals needs to be carefully 6 \nexamined as well, especially when the serial correlation becomes are issue due to the 7 \napplications of low-pass filtering. 8 \nWe also show that, at inter-annual time scale, the temperature anomaly responds to 9 \nsolar irradiance and geomagnetic activity in different ways when the data are sub-10 \nsampled according to the phases of the QBO, to the intensity of solar irradiance or to 11 \nthe levels of geomagnetic activity. In general, for a given region, sub-sampling tends 12 \nto strengthen the signals under one condition and weaken the signals under another. 13 \nThe stratospheric Fs signals are strengthened when the QBO is easterly or 14 \ngeomagnetic activity is high, while the stratospheric Ap signals are strengthened when 15 \nthe QBO is westerly or solar irradiance is high. The tropospheric solar signals are 16 \nmostly related to solar irradiance alone and are enhanced when the QBO is westerly.  17 \nThe tropospheric regions where Ta shows relatively large statistical response to Fs 18 \ninclude: 1) the Ferrell cells; 2) regions between the Ferrell cells and the Hadley cells. 19 \nThese tropospheric Fs signals tend to be fragmented under high or low geomagnetic 20 \nactivity. While the extra-polar stratospheric Fs (or Ap) signals tend to appear when 21 \ngeomagnetic activity (or solar irradiance) is high, the QBO signals, conversely, tend 22 \nto be stronger when solar irradiance or geomagnetic activity is low. 23 \n 36\nOne of the most interesting features found through sub-sampling is that, in the 1 \nstratosphere, solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity tend to enhance each other in 2 \nthe extra-polar region and compensate each other in the Arctic. High geomagnetic 3 \nactivity enhances the Fs signals by strengthening the positive correlation between Fs 4 \nand Ta in the stratosphere, while high solar irradiance seems to enhance the 5 \ncorrelations between Ap and Ta in the subtropical to mid-latitude lower stratosphere. 6 \nSuch signal enhancement is made symmetrically about the equator. The anomalous 7 \nincrease\/decrease in temperature in these regions would alter the large-scale 8 \natmospheric circulation, including the Brewer-Dobson and the Hadley circulations. 9 \nThe Ferrell cells, which exist in response to the transfer of energy from lower to 10 \nhigher latitudes by mid-latitude eddies, are identified as one of the primary regions 11 \ninfluenced mostly by solar irradiance.  12 \nIn summary, geomagnetic activity and solar irradiance interact with each other and 13 \ntheir effects in the atmosphere may either reinforce (e.g. at the tropics and mid-14 \nlatitudes) or compromise each other (e.g. high-latitudes and polar region). The 15 \nreinforcement or compromising also depends on the modulating effects of 16 \natmospheric dynamics, which cause additional spatial and seasonal variations in those 17 \nsignals. Though physical mechanics of mutual-modulation can be extremely complex, 18 \nat inter-annual time scale, atmospheric response to solar irradiance and geomagnetic 19 \nactivity are shown to be statistically different during different phases of the 20 \nstratospheric QBO. This suggests that the QBO, and its phase in particular, may act as 21 \na mechanism to change the propagation conditions for planetary waves and as an 22 \namplifier for possible multiple solar signals in the lower part of the atmosphere. 23 \n 24 \n 37\n6.
