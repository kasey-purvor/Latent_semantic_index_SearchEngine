Revised\n2 E. SHAPIRO AND D. DRIKAKIS\n1. INTRODUCTION\nOne of the difficulties when dealing with the computation of incompressible flows is the\ndecoupling of the continuity and momentum equations due to the absence of the pressure\n(or density) term from the former. Two different approaches that have received attention\nfor solving the incompressible equations are the artificial-compressibility approach [1] and\nprojection methods [2, 4, 5], approximate and exact. The projection formulation also shares\nsimilarities with the pressure-Poisson approach [6]. A review of the artificial-compressibility\nand projection methods can be found in [3].\nThe growing interest in the artificial compressibility approach is partly due to the direct\ncoupling of continuity and momentum equations, which allows the use of explicit schemes and\nfacilitates the development of memory-efficient easily parallelisable solvers. Recent examples\nof efficient numerical schemes utilising the artificial compressibility approach can be found in\n[7, 8], where a characteristics-based split finite element scheme has been modified to create\nan efficient fully explicit solver; in [9, 10], where an artificial compressibility scheme utilising\nvertex-centred and dual-cell, edge-based spatial discretisation, has been developed; as well as\nin [11, 12] where a characteristics-based (CB) scheme [13] has been combined with multigrid\nstrategies to provide efficient solutions for two- and the three-dimensional flows.\nThe discretisation schemes and solvers developed for artificial compressibility have many\nsimilarities with the methods developed for compressible flows. In particular, artificial\ncompressibility coupling facilitates the use of high-resolution Godunov-type schemes for\nincompressible flows [3]. An example of Godunov-type method used both for incompressible\nand compressible flows, is the CB scheme of [14], which was extended to incompressible flows\nby Drikakis et al. [13, 3]. The CB scheme has been proven to provide accurate solutions in\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int. J. Numer. Meth.

One formulation uses the divergence-free condition in the numerical\nreconstruction of the primitive variables, whereas the other does not. These formulations result\nin different high-resolution, Godunov-type schemes. Improving the efficiency of a numerical\nsolution is of crucial importance both in two- and three-dimensional simulations, especially\nwhen multi-parametric investigations (geometry or physics related) are required. Here, we\npresent a unified formulation for conservative and non-conservative CB schemes, carry out\neigenvalue analysis to study the effects of these schemes on convergence and further perform\ntwo- and three-dimensional computations for test problems to examine the the accuracy and\nefficiency of the schemes.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the derivation of conservative and\nnon-conservative CB schemes for incompressible flows as well as the computational strategy\nemployed in this paper for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Section 3\npresents the eigenvalue analysis for the two CB schemes. Numerical tests demonstrating\naccuracy and efficiency issues are presented in Section 4.

(8)\nEquations (6) and (8) consist two different formulations of the artificial-compressibility\nequations, with the former encompassing velocity divergence terms in the momentum\nequations. Henceforth, we will refer to the systems (6) and (8) as conservative and non-\nconservative formulations, respectively.\nUsing the above two formulations as a starting point, in the next section we derive two\ndifferent CB schemes. We will show that although both formulations yield similar results for\nthe solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the eigenstructure of the systems\n(6) and (8) is different thus leading to different convergence properties. The systems (6) and\n(8) are used solely for the CB reconstruction of the advective flux in \u03be\u2212direction and a similar\nprocedure can be used for the fluxes in the other two directions. Once the fluxes are discretised,\nthe actual system equations which is numerically integrated is the conservative equations (3).\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int. J. Numer. Meth.

(17)\nIn the present work, the left and right statesUL,R are calculated by third order interpolation\n(see [3] for more details). The CB scheme given by (15) is applicable to both steady and\nunsteady flows. In the case of unsteady computations the dual time-stepping approach can\nbe used in conjunction with the artificial-compressibility. According to the dual-time stepping\napproach, pseudo-time derivatives are added to both continuity and momentum equations\n[3]. The equations are solved at each real time step by driving the discretised pseudo-time\nderivatives to the machine zero. The real time derivatives are treated as source terms and can\nbe discretised by first or higher-order differences.\nThe reconstructed variables at the cell faces are used to compute the advective fluxes in (9).\nThe viscous fluxes are approximated by central differences. The numerical time integration\nwas obtained by a fourth order accurate explicit Runge-Kutta scheme [23]. A full multigrid\n- full approximation storage algorithm (FMG-FAS) is also used to accelerate numerical\nconvergence [12, 3]. The multigrid strategy employed here comprises of three V-cycles, ten\npre-smoothing and post-relaxation iterations on the fine grid, five post-relaxation iterations\non the intermediate grid and five hundred iterations on the coarse grid. Details of the multigrid\nalgorithm used in this study can be found in [12].\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int. J. Numer. Meth.

We consider \u03c1 = \u03c1 (|\u03bb0|) for both formulations\nand note that these functions have uniformly positive derivatives for any (positive) value\nof \u03b2. Moreover, from (29) and (31) it can be seen that \u03c1NC (|\u03bb0|) = \u03c1C (|\u03bb0| \/2), therefore\n\u03c1C (|\u03bb0|) > \u03c1NC (|\u03bb0|) for any |\u03bb0|, i.e., the spectral radius of the system matrix is greater in\nthe case of the conservative formulation.\nOne immediate consequence of the above is that when local time stepping is employed, the\nnon-conservative formulation allows the use of larger time steps. For the same CFL number,\nthe ratio of the maximum possible local time step for the conservative and non-conservative\nschemes is given by:\nRt (|\u03bb0| , \u03b2) = \u2206tNC\u2206tC =\n\u03c1C (|\u03bb0| , \u03b2)\n\u03c1NC (|\u03bb0| , \u03b2) = 2\n|\u03bb0|+\n\u221a\n\u03bb20 + \u03b2\n|\u03bb0|+\n\u221a\n\u03bb20 + 4\u03b2\n(33)\nBy normalising \u03bb0 with\n\u221a\n\u03b2 and introducing the similarity variable r = |\u03bb0| \/\n\u221a\n\u03b2, the ratio\nof time steps can be written as a function of r:\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Therefore, one should expect the differences in numerical\nconvergence between the two schemes to be larger for smaller values of \u03b2 as well as when the\nlocal flow speed is higher (Fig. 1a).\nThe characteristic condition number is considered to be a measure of numerical stiffness. In\nterms of the similarity variable r, we can express the ratio of characteristic condition numbers\nobtained for the two formulations as follows\nRk (r) =\nKC\nKNC\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n2\n\u221a\nr2+1+r\u221a\nr2+4+r\n, when r \u2264 1\u221a\n3\n\u221a\nr2+1+r\u221a\nr2+1\u2212r \u00b7 2r\u221ar2+4+r , when 1\u221a3 < r \u2264 1\u221a2\n\u221a\nr2+1+r\u221a\nr2+1\u2212r \u00b7\n\u221a\nr2+4\u2212r\u221a\nr2+4+r\n, when r \u2265 1\u221a\n2\n(35)\nRk is also a monotonously increasing function of its argument and is always greater than 1 with\nan asymptote of 4 at infinity (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the non-conservative formulation results in\nlarger local time steps and is also better conditioned for any values of the local flow speed and\nartificial compressibility parameter.\nThe results of the eigenvalue analysis are indicative of the differences between the two\nschemes. Since the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is strongly a non-linear problem,\nnumerical experiments are required to confirm the above analysis by comparing the convergence\nbehaviour of the two formulations for a particular flow. Such experiments are presented in the\nnext section.\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2000; 00:1\u20131\nPrepared using nmeauth.cls\n14 E. SHAPIRO AND D. DRIKAKIS\n4. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS\nThe two-dimensional flow over a backward facing step and three-dimensional flow in a channel\nwith two inlets have been selected for investigating the accuracy and convergence behaviour\nof the two characteristics-based variants. The two cases are described in detail below. The\nconvergence has been assessed using the norm of the variables derivatives in pseudo-time,\nConv = max\nk,i,j\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223f\nn+1\nk,i,j \u2212 fnk,i,j\n\u2206\u03c4i,j\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223, (36)\nwhere k stands for the primitive variable, i and j are spatial indices, and n stands for the\niteration count in pseudo-time. The solution is considered to be converged when Conv \u2264 10\u22126.\nThe efficiency is assessed in terms of multigrid cycles Nmg required to reach the above\nconvergence threshold. Furthermore, the difference in the accuracy of the solution for the\nconservative and non-conservative schemes is examined using the following criterion:\npdiff = max\ni,j\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223pC \u2212 pNCpC \u00b7 100\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223. (37)\nThe time step is defined by\n\u2206ti,j =\nCFL(\nmax\nk\n|\u03bbk|\n)\ni,j\n. (38)\nwhere CFL is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number.\nThe flow over a backward-facing step has been investigated by a number of researchers\nboth experimentally and numerically. We have performed computations for a backward facing\nstep with inlet to channel expansion ratio 2:3 and downstream channel length equal to 60 step\nheights, which corresponds to the case studied experimentally by Denham and Patrick [24] and\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2000; 00:1\u20131\nPrepared using nmeauth.cls\nNON-CONSERVATIVE AND CONSERVATIVE FORMULATIONS OF CHARACTERISTICS-BASED SCHEMES15\nnumerically by Atkins et al. [25]. The computations have been performed on a grid containing\n41\u00d7 33 nodes in the inlet section and 160\u00d7 49 nodes in the main channel. Simulations using\ncoarser (81\u00d7 25) and finer (321\u00d7 97) grids in the main channel were also performed showing\nthat the results between the 160 \u00d7 49 and 321 \u00d7 97 differed less than XXXX%. Therefore, it\nwas decided all the computations to be carried out using the 160 \u00d7 49 grid. Computations\nwere performed for Reynolds numbers in the range between 73 and 700. Comparisons with\nthe experimental data of [24] are presented in Figures 2a and 2b for Re = 73 and Re = 229,\nrespectively. The Reynolds number calculation is based on the step height and maximum\nvelocity at the inlet profile. Note that for the case of Re = 229 the experimental inlet profile\ndiffers significantly from the parabolic one, therefore in order to compare with the experimental\ndata we have used the experimental velocity profile as boundary condition at the inlet. The\nseparated flow near the expansion at Re = 73 is shown in Figure 3. The value of pdiff did\nnot exceed 0.09%, thus we can state that both characteristics-based schemes yield very similar\nresults.\nFigure 4 shows the convergence for two different Reynolds numbers and CFL = 0.6, while\nFigure 5 shows the number of multigrid cycles and gain ratio, i.e., ratio of multigrid cycles of\nconservative to non-conservative scheme (NCmg\/NNCmg ), as function of the Reynolds number. The\nnon-conservative formulation provides faster computations (less multigrid cycles are required)\nand this is in accord with the eigenvalue analysis presented in the preceding section. Note\nthat although the choice of multigrid parameters (e.g., pre- and post-relaxation iterations)\neffects the multigrid acceleration [12], it has been found that the relative efficiency of the non-\nconservative versus the conservative scheme remains the same if both schemes are employed\nin conjunction with the same values of multigrid parameters.\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DRIKAKIS\nThe second case considered in this study is the three-dimensional flow in a channel with with\ntwo inlets. This geometry is frequently used in microfluidic applications, such as separation\nand detection [26, 27, 28], micro-mixing [29, 30] and micro-fabrication [31, 32]. In many of\nthese applications, the reagents are carried by weak solutions (see, for example [31, 32]) and\nthe hydrodynamics of the flow, particularly the entrance length, is dominated by the solvent,\nwhich reduces the hydrodynamic problem to a single-fluid flow.\nThe device configuration and the development of the flow is shown in Figure 6a. The\ncomputations have been performed on a grid containing 29\u00d713\u00d713 nodes in each inlet section\nand 253 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 13 nodes in the main channel. Figure 6b shows the norm of deviation of the\nvelocity profile in the main channel from the analytic steady-state solution for a rectangular\nchannel, e.g., see [33, 34]; this is defined as max\ni,j\n|ucomp \u2212 uan| \/uan \u2217 100, where ucomp and\nuan are the computational and analytical solutions, respectively. The difference pdiff of the\nsolutions obtained by the conservative and non-conservative schemes did not exceed 0.09%\nthus both schemes provide similar accuracy.\nSimilar to the backward-facing step case, the non-conservative scheme exhibited (slightly)\nbetter convergence than the conservative scheme. The convergence histories are shown in\nFigure 7 for computations performed at two different Reynolds numbers. Figure 8 shows the\nnumber of multigrid cycles and gain ratio as function of the Reynolds number. The gain ratio\nis lower than the the backward-facing step case, but it is greater than 1 for all Reynolds\nnumbers considered here. Finally, the number of multigrid cycles for the conservative and non-\nconservative schemes are reported in Tables I and II for three-dimensional computations using\ndifferent CFL numbers. The results show consistently that the non-conservative formulation\nis slightly faster. Similar to the backward-facing step case, the convergence results for the\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int. J. Numer. Meth.

For the backward-facing step and converging channel cases each multigrid cycle\ntook (on average) 1.77 seconds and 17.42 seconds, respectively, according to Fortran CPU\nintrinsic procedure.\n5. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nNon-conservative and conservative formulations of characteristics-based numerical recon-\nstructions have been derived and assessed for their accuracy and efficiency in two and\nthree dimensional incompressible flows. We have shown through eigenvalue analysis that the\ntwo schemes should exhibit different convergence and have validated this outcome against\nnumerical experiments.\nThe numerical experiments show that the conservative and non-conservative formulations\nprovide the same accuracy but they differ in terms of convergence. The non-conservative scheme\nappears to be faster (or slightly faster) than the conservative version for all Reynolds numbers\nand flow cases considered in this study.\nFinally, we note that the analysis presented in this paper can also be applicable to other\nhigh-resolution schemes and Riemann solvers that involve cell face numerical reconstruction\nof the primitive variables.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe financial support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (GR\/S13668) is\nCopyright c\u00a9 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
