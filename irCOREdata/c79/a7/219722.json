In the light of women\u2019s relative lack of power in many aspects of\ninterpersonal relationships with men in many African settings, our objective is to explore how male denial of\nHIV\/AIDS impacts on their female partners\u2019 ability to access and adhere to ART.\nMethods: We conducted a qualitative case study involving thematic analysis of 37 individual interviews and five\nfocus groups with a total of 53 male and female antiretroviral drug users and 25 healthcare providers in rural\neastern Zimbabwe.\nResults: Rooted in hegemonic notions of masculinity, men saw HIV\/AIDS as a threat to their manhood and dignity\nand exhibited a profound fear of the disease. In the process of denying and avoiding their association with AIDS,\nmany men undermine their wives\u2019 efforts to access and adhere to ART. Many women felt unable to disclose their\nHIV status to their husbands, forcing them to take their medication in secret, and act without a supportive\ntreatment partner, which is widely accepted to be vitally important for adherence success. Some husbands, when\ndiscovering that their wives are on ART, deny them permission to take the drugs, or indeed steal the drugs for\ntheir own treatment. Men\u2019s avoidance of HIV also leave many HIV-positive women feeling vulnerable to re-infection\nas their husbands, in an attempt to demonstrate their manhood, are believed to continue engaging in HIV-risky\nbehaviours.\nConclusions: Hegemonic notions of masculinity can interfere with women\u2019s adherence to ART. It is important that\nthose concerned with promoting effective treatment services recognise the gender and household dynamics that\nmay prevent some women from successfully adhering to ART, and explore ways to work with both women and\nmen to identify couples-based strategies to increase adherence to ART\nBackground\nAntiretroviral programmes are expanding throughout\nsub-Saharan Africa, providing people living with HIV\nand AIDS (PLHIV) with glimpses of hope [1]. However,\nantiretroviral therapy (ART) is complex, and treatment\nregimens must be carefully adhered to in order to avoid\ndrug resistance [2] and improve survival [3]. This\nrequires consistent and meticulous monitoring [4,5], and\nis most likely to be achieved with the support of a treat-\nment partner [6-8], family members [8,9] and peers\nfrom the community [7,10]. The likelihood of successful\nART adherence is optimized in contexts where there\ncan be a certain openness and acceptance of their HIV\nstatus [1], allowing antiretroviral (ARV) users to negoti-\nate support from significant others, and fit ART into\ntheir daily schedule, free from fear and stigma [11]. Dis-\nclosing HIV status and ART initiation to long-term\npartners are therefore often said to be key to ART\nadherence [12,13].

We\nfully acknowledge that more women than men take an\nactive role in accessing HIV services [14,15], and\nwomen have been observed to respond more positively\nto the adherence of ART than men [16,17]. Such find-\nings suggest that many women are able to take control\nof their health, more so than men. Nevertheless, while\nno other study has previously explored the link between\nmasculinity and women\u2019s adherence to ART, an expand-\ning number of studies have examined the negative\nimpact of men\u2019s disengagement with HIV services to the\nuptake of antenatal voluntary counselling and testing\n(VCT) and mother to child transmission [18,19].\nIn Tanzania, for example, men\u2019s lack of participation\nin VCT was found to reduce the chances of their HIV-\npositive wives using nevirapine prophylaxis for the pre-\nvention of mother to child transmission and their\nchances of avoiding breastfeeding, as well as of adhering\nto alternative infant feeding methods [19]. However, a\nrecent study suggests that if men are formally invited to\nattend antenatal care and couple\u2019s HIV testing, many\nmen will attend with their wives, reducing mother to\nchild transmission [20]. Understanding the processes\nthat contribute to men\u2019s (dis)engagement with HIV ser-\nvices, and the impact on family members, is therefore\nkey for the prevention and treatment of AIDS for family\nmembers [15].\nThe paper is framed within Connell\u2019s [21] concept of\nhegemonic masculinity, a social constructionist theory\noften used to explain differences in the health-seeking\nbehaviours of men and women [22]. Connell argues that\nmany societies subscribe to a dominant definition of\nmasculinity that both reinforces and demonstrates male\npower in a given place and time and, in the process,\nsubordinates women, as well as the other non-dominant\nforms of masculinity that will exist in any social setting,\nfor example, homosexual masculinities or masculinities\nassociated with less controlling attitudes to women.\nHegemonic notions of \u201ca real man\u201d as tough, indepen-\ndent, physically strong, fearless and sexually unstoppable\nhave been identified as key drivers of the AIDS epidemic\nin many African settings [23]. It is against this back-\nground, and in the light of our interest to draw atten-\ntion to the impact of household dynamics on ART\nadherence, that we examine how masculinity and men\u2019s\nresponses to HIV interfere with women\u2019s adherence to\nART in rural Zimbabwe.\nMethods\nThe study, which forms part of an ongoing research\nproject on factors shaping service access and treatment\nadherence in eastern Zimbabwe, was granted ethical\napproval from the Medical Research Council of Zim-\nbabwe (A\/681) and Imperial College London\n(ICREC_9_3_13). Written and informed consent was\ngathered from all research participants with the agree-\nment that their identities would not be revealed. Pseu-\ndonyms have therefore been used throughout.\nStudy setting and sampling\nParticipants for this qualitative study were recruited\nfrom three rural areas, where the majority of people sus-\ntain their livelihoods through subsistence farming or\nwork on tea and coffee plantations. The rural areas are\nlocated in the Manicaland Province of Eastern Zim-\nbabwe. The province is characterized by high levels of\npoverty and HIV, though the latter has seen some\ndecline. The HIV prevalence rate stands at 18%, a\ndecline from 23% over a five-year period [24]. In 2009,\n215,000 people in Zimbabwe (57% of those living with\nAIDS) accessed ART [25]. These trends are testimony\nto the positive progress that has been made to curtail\nthe epidemic and make ART accessible in Zimbabwe.\nThis study draws on the perspectives of active ARV\nusers and nurses, focusing on their understandings and\nretrospective experiences of factors shaping their access\nand adherence to ART. ARV users were independently\nsampled using a mix of snowball (using village commu-\nnity health workers), opportunistic (self-selected infor-\nmants) and typical case (adherers to ART) sampling.\nNone of the ARV users were husbands and wives.\nNurses from three health facilities were recruited on the\nbasis of their willingness to participate in the study.\nData collection and analysis\nThe research methods used for this study were indivi-\ndual interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs).\nBoth these methods allow researchers to explore areas\nof interest in depth, but as FGDs involve the interac-\ntion between a group of people, the methods may yield\ndifferent information. As we wanted to explore the\neffect of masculinity on women\u2019s ART adherence, we\nwere particularly keen on bringing women together in\nFGDs, hoping that this would reveal similarities and\ndifferences of experiences and that the sharing of\nexperiences would enable them to articulate the nuan-\nces of their experiences. We conducted 19 individual\ninterviews and four FGDs with a total of 32 female\nand 21 male ARV users, and 18 individual interviews\nand one FGD with a total of 11 female and 14 male\nhealth staff (see Table 1). Each FGD had an average of\nSkovdal et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2011, 14:29\nhttp:\/\/www.jiasociety.org\/content\/14\/1\/29\nPage 2 of 7\neight participants. Individual interviews averaged one\nhour and group interviews averaged 2.3 hours.\nInterview topic guides were the same for both indivi-\ndual interviews and FGDs, and explored such areas as\ncounselling and testing uptake and treatment adherence,\ndisclosure of HIV and experiences at the healthcare cen-\ntre. To gather more specific information about different\nexperiences of HIV service access, participants were\nasked: \u201cWhat factors do you think have the most impact\non access?\u201d, \u201cWhy do some patients fail to present\nthemselves at services?\u201d, \u201cCan you give me an example\nof a person with HIV who was good at accessing HIV\nservices?\u201d and \u201cCan you give me an example of a patient\nwho failed to access the services at the best time?\u201d.\nMost respondents referred to gender differences, and\nnon-directive probing questions were used to encourage\ninformants to expand on these. In addition to questions\nfrom the interview topic guide, ARV users participating\nin FGDs were invited to role play \u201ca good visit to the\nhealth centre\u201d and \u201ca bad visit to the health centre\"; this\nwas to gain insight into the interaction of service users\nand providers in this context. The role plays allowed us\nto explore the characteristics of a typical service user\/\nprovider interaction, While the role playing involved only\na few of the FGD participants (the role play lasted five to\n10 minutes), everyone contributed to the planning of the\nrole play and the discussion about it afterwards.\nInterviews were conducted by three experienced\nShona-speaking fieldworkers and were audio recorded,\nwith permission from the informants. These were subse-\nquently transcribed and translated into English by the\nfieldworkers and imported into Atlas.Ti, a qualitative\nanalysis software package, for coding (providing text\nsegments with descriptive headings). The coding was\ndone by two people who coded the data independently\nfrom each other. The analysts subsequently discussed\nemerging themes. The coding process generated a total\nof 225 codes. We have reported on some of these codes\nelsewhere [1,7,26-28] and will make no attempt to dis-\ncuss all of these codes in this paper. For this paper, we\nused Attride-Stirling\u2019s [29] thematic network analysis to\nhelp us identify codes and themes relevant to our inter-\nest in the impacts of masculinities on women\u2019s ART\naccess and adherence (Table 2). This process generated\n26 codes, covering 12 basic themes, which are discussed\nin our Results section. These basic themes were further\nclustered into three more inclusive \u201corganising themes\u201d,\nwhich serve as the sub-headings for our findings, which\nfollow.\nResults\nSocial constructions of masculinity\nTo understand how masculinity interferes with women\u2019s\nART adherence, this sub-section gives detail on how\nhegemonic notions of masculinity influence men\u2019s\nexperiences of HIV. Both male and female nurses and\nARV users made reference to hegemonic notions of\nmasculinity, describing \u201ca real man\u201d as physically strong,\ntough and resilient to illness, independent, responsible\nand successful in sustaining his family. For a man to\ncontract HIV and develop AIDS is therefore perceived\nas a threat to his sense of masculinity:\nI really felt such HIV tests were going to embarrass\nme and make me feel useless. As a man I have that\npride of being the father, the husband and head of\nthe family and can you imagine an HIV positive\nresult will just wash away all that respect. (Joseph,\npatient)\nThere is that pride and men feel that being ill is a\nwomen\u2019s issue because it is rather belittling to be\nseen coming to the hospital every now and then as\nit is a sign of weakness. (Philip, patient)\nThe idea that being ill belittles a man\u2019s sense of man-\nhood and role as head of household and that hospitals\nare seen as female territories highlights the conflict that\nexists between socially constructed notions of masculi-\nnity and HIV.\nMen\u2019s fear and denial of HIV\nTo mediate the links between social constructions of\nmasculinity and husbands\u2019 interference with their wives\u2019\nART adherence, we now turn to examining the conflict\nthat exists between masculinity and HIV and how this\nhas led many men in this context to develop a profound\nfear of any association with HIV, preventing them from\ngetting tested and disclosing their HIV status:\nThere are people in this community who are not\nfeeling well and know that they should go and get\ntested for HIV, yet they are afraid to ... The problem\nis very common with men, men are afraid to come\nout in the open and face the reality.

For example,\nmen reported that that testing positive would represent\nthem as promiscuous and irresponsible:\nFor me, it kind of gives people an impression that I\nhave been sleeping around carelessly, which is not\ntrue at all. We have been given information that this\ndisease mainly affects people who sleep around care-\nlessly, and, when one tests HIV positive, it kind of\nconfirms to the public that I have been having care-\nless extra-marital sexual relationships. I was really\nworried, and I couldn\u2019t come to terms with an HIV\npositive result. (Liyod, patient)\nSuch representation, coupled with their HIV status,\nmade married men fear that their wives would leave\nthem, while younger men felt that women would have\nno interest in them and that they would remain bache-\nlors for the rest of their lives:\nIf positive, some young men feel they would lose\ntheir chances of getting a woman to marry them.\n(Henry, patient)\nNurses and ARV users of both genders articulated the\npressure that men are under to conform to hegemonic\nnotions of masculinity and their fear of the potential\nconsequences of being HIV positive. As illustrated by\nHenry, this can lead men to deny the fact that they may\nbe HIV positive and delay seeking HIV testing and\ntreatment. The men participating in this study spoke\nabout their difficulties in coming to terms with their\nHIV status and admitted that it was only when they\nwere very ill and had developed AIDS that they got\nTable 2 Coding framework: Pathways through which masculinity impacts on women\u2019s opportunities for adherence\nCodes Basic themes identified Organizing themes\n- Men feel superior\n- Strong and resilient\n- Independent and tough\n- Pride\n- Can\u2019t show fear\n- Men are heads of house\n- Men have girlfriends\n- Women not allowed\nextra marital relationships\n1.

Not only does the pro-\nfound fear that is embedded in men\u2019s experience of HIV\nimpact negatively on men\u2019s own health, it can also, as\nwe will now discuss, interfere with women\u2019s treatment\nof HIV.\nMasculinity interfering with married women\u2019s ART\nadherence\nWhile women in this context were good at making use\nof HIV services, they faced a number of obstacles in\ntheir efforts to adhere to ART, many of which related to\ntheir husbands\u2019 fear of association with HIV. Women\nwho had gone to get tested and tested positive and\nknew of their husbands\u2019 fear of HIV were often afraid of\ntelling their husbands about their HIV seroconversion:\nI know a certain lady who attended these HIV\/AIDS\nfunctions and decided to take up HIV tests and she\ntested HIV positive, but she could not tell her hus-\nband even though she suspected him of being the\none who infected her. (Constantine, patient)\nWomen unable to share with their husbands their\nHIV status and their need to comply with a strict treat-\nment programme miss out on getting support from\nfamily members, compromising their ability to adhere\nsuccessfully.\nMen\u2019s non-disclosure of their HIV status, as well as\ntheir position in deciding whether or not to use con-\ndoms when having sex with their wives, can leave\nwomen open for infection or re-infection, particularly if\ntheir husbands are not on ART [30]. A number of\nwomen on ART spoke about their husbands\u2019 denial of\ntheir HIV status and their continued promiscuity, fear-\ning re-infections that might complicate their treatment\nregimen:\nMen are a problem. Women on ART come to sup-\nport group activities, yet their husbands do not come\nand we don\u2019t know whether these men have been\ntested. In these support groups, we are taught to have\nprotected sex to avoid re-infection, but the husbands\ndo not come. If I am on ART but my husband is still\nunwilling to get tested for HIV, he will refuse to have\nprotected sex, yet I am already on ART and at risk of\nbeing re-infected. (Martha, patient)\nA number of nurses, when speaking about challenges\nto women\u2019s adherence to ART, recognised the role of\ntheir clients\u2019 husbands and often felt demotivated by\ntheir efforts to support women on ART as their advice\nto female patients was often undermined by their\npatient\u2019s husbands:\nI am very unsatisfied and I feel pulled down when I\nam dealing with a female patient whose male coun-\nterpart refuses to come for [an] HIV test. You see\nthis means your efforts are in vain because you treat\nher and she goes to be re-infected at home because\nthe husband disregards condom use. (Roselyn, nurse)\nRooted in men\u2019s fear of association with HIV, nurses\nfrequently spoke about how husbands could prevent\ntheir wives from attending monthly review dates and\npicking up their antiretroviral drugs - interfering with\nwomen\u2019s adherence to ART. Some men were reported\nto have stolen their wives\u2019 hospital cards in an attempt\nto prevent them from going to the clinic:\nSome women say their husbands deny them the\nright to come to the hospital saying \u201cyou want to\nexpose me that I am HIV positive\u201d, so they even go\nfurther by stealing their wives\u2019 hospital cards. How-\never, such husbands need counselling. (Tsitsi, nurse)\nAnother commonly reported strategy used by hus-\nbands to disassociate themselves with AIDS and prevent\ntheir wives from going to the hospital and adhering to\ntheir treatment was to threaten their wives with divorce\nif they continued to make use of HIV services:\nWomen when they come to get services from the\nopportunistic infection (OI) clinic and they are\ninitiated on ART, the husband will then threaten to\ndivorce the wife if she continues taking antiretroviral\ndrugs. This will then affect her ability to adhere to\nART. (Weston, nurse)\nFinally, and reflecting men\u2019s own fear of enrolling\nonto an ART programme, husbands were reported to\nsteal ARVs from their wives to take themselves:\n... as you ask into why she did not adhere she will\nbegin to open up and she may even cry telling you\nthe real problem; \u201cI have a problem, my husband\ndoesn\u2019t want to come to OI clinic, when I get my\nmonthly supply, he will grab my tablets and take\nthem himself.\u201d (Weston, nurse)\nIn this subsection, we have outlined some of the many\nvaried ways through which men\u2019s fear of HIV and AIDS,\nrooted in hegemonic notions of masculinity, can prevent\ntheir wives from adhering successfully to ART.\nDiscussion\nThrough our discussion of social constructions of mas-\nculinity, men\u2019s fear and denial of HIV, and how such\nSkovdal et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2011, 14:29\nhttp:\/\/www.jiasociety.org\/content\/14\/1\/29\nPage 5 of 7\nresponses interfere with women\u2019s adherence to ART, we\nhave presented an account of the dynamic relationship\nbetween hegemonic notions of masculinity and married\nwomen\u2019s adherence to ART. As men perceived being ill\nfrom HIV\/AIDS as a threat to their manhood (e.g., men\nas strong, in control of their sexuality, resilient to illness\nand capable of being the breadwinners), men feared\nHIV\/AIDS, a fear intensified by prospects of being\nrepresented as promiscuous or ending up without a life\ncompanion. As a result of this fear, men actively sought\nto disassociate themselves from any activities that might\nlink them to HIV\/AIDS. In this process, men presented\na number of obstacles to their wives who felt more\ncomfortable in accessing HIV services, interfering with\ntheir opportunities for optimal adherence to ART. They\ndid so by increasing their risk of re-infection and pre-\nventing them from attending hospital appointments and\nfrom taking their medicines. In summary, our findings\nsuggest that husbands\u2019 commitments to hegemonic\nnotions of masculinity can prevent their wives from\nadhering to ART.\nThe relevance and generalizability of these findings\ndeserve some discussion. As we spoke with ART users\nwho reported retrospectively about their experiences in\ncoming to terms with their HIV seroconversion and\nuptake and adherence to ART, we felt it was important\nto corroborate their views with those of nurses and other\nhealth staff, obtaining the views of health staff who dealt\nwith cases of non-adherence at the time of this study. To\nmove beyond individual accounts and experiences, we\nsought to map out the responses and meanings that our\ninformants articulated, guided by our theoretical frame-\nwork and research aim, in order to develop a narrative\nand interpretive understanding of the role of masculinity\nin interfering with women\u2019s adherence to ART. However,\nas this study was conducted in a unique context, we\nacknowledge that generalizability can only be achieved\nthrough the investigation of masculinity on women\u2019s\nART adherence in other contexts.\nFurthermore, as the study was exploratory, it did not\nseek to compare and contrast responses across different\nsocio-demographic groups. Future research exploring\nthe pathways between masculinity and its impact on\nwomen\u2019s adherence to ART should therefore consider\nthe trajectory of discordant and HIV-infected couples,\nand their age and marital status, as well as the clinical\ncharacteristics of patients, Nevertheless, we believe that\nour findings provide a potential explanation for previous\nstudies that have highlighted the negative impact that\nmen\u2019s disengagement with HIV services can have on\nmother to children transmissions [18,19], adding to pre-\nvious knowledge by illustrating the link between mascu-\nlinity and men\u2019s disengagement with HIV services and\nhow this impact family members.\nConclusions\nCertain recommendations can be made from our analy-\nsis. First, it makes little sense to HIV test and treat only\none of the partners in a relationship. Although couple\ntesting and ART enrolment has had positive outcomes\nin some settings, couple-focused programmes are still\nnot widespread [31]. Second, there is an urgent need for\nHIV services to consider the gender and household\ndynamics that prevent men from making use of the ser-\nvices and for women to successfully adhere to treat-\nment. They can do this either by providing\nopportunities for men to deconstruct hegemonic notions\nof masculinity and create spaces where masculinities can\nbe renegotiated and transformed or by creating thera-\npeutic environments that are friendlier and aligned to\nlocal masculinities. As masculinities are negotiated and\nconstructed at a community level, we believe that ART\nprogrammes need to scale up community-outreach pro-\ngrammes that consult local men about their fears of\nHIV\/AIDS and develop responses accordingly.\nWriting in South Africa, Colvin and Robins [32] have\nfound local social support groups for men particularly\neffective in creating such spaces. Also in South Africa,\nthe Men as Partners (MAP) programme by the Engen-\nderHealth organization and the Planned Parenthood\nAssociation has found systematic discussions of masculi-\nnity and the involvement of men to be key in addressing\nthe gender issues, power dynamics and gender stereo-\ntypes that contribute to women\u2019s marginalized position\nin responding to HIV\/AIDS [33,34]. Bila and Egrot [15]\nrecently concluded from their study on gender asymme-\ntry to healthcare facility attendance among PLHIV in\nBurkina Faso that to reduce women\u2019s vulnerability and\nstrengthen their responses to ART adherence, one must\nunderstand men\u2019s disengagement with HIV services.\nWe have in this paper, and elsewhere [35], moved this\ndebate forward and outlined the relationship that exists\nbetween hegemonic notions of masculinity, men\u2019s disen-\ngagement with HIV services and couple-based obstacles\nthat women face in ART adherence.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful for the constructive comments of the editorial team and the\nanonymous reviewers.
