As recolonised populations may be founded by a limited \nnumber of individuals, there is significant potential for genetic bottlenecks. Previous \nstudies of pioneer tree dynamics have failed to consider population density interactions \n(by sampling populations with different densities) and the multigenerational \nconsequences of recolonisation. In this paper we examine the genetic outcomes of a \nclearance\/recolonisation regime for a Costa Rican long-lived pioneer species, Vochysia \nferruginea, at a series of sites with different densities and across multi-generational \ncohorts (old growth forest, secondary forest and seedlings) using variation for amplified \nfragment length polymorphism (AFLPs) and single sequence repeats (SSRs, \nmicrosatellites).  A clearance\/recolonisation phase was found to significantly increase \nfine-scale genetic structuring (average intensity of spatial genetic structure, Sp [SSR] = \n0.0358) compared to old growth forest (Sp = 0.0126), and significantly reduces genetic \ndiversity (Shannon\u2019s index [AFLP] = 0.202 and 0.271-0.355 for other forest histories \nfollowing density correction), which compounds over generations (e.g. at Tirimbina: old \ngrowth forest, allelic richness, RT [SSR] = 8.86; secondary forest RT = 7.95; seedlings RT \n= 4.76). Spatial structuring of closely related individuals suggests that V. ferruginea \ncolonises sites via early invaders, which establish patches with half sib relationship. The \nvariability observed between cohorts for genetic differentiation and inbreeding \ncoefficients suggests that the presence of remnant trees can have an important impact on \nthe genetic make up of recolonised populations. One main concern from these results is \nthat if secondary forest blocks harbour reduced genetic diversity and persist in the \nlandscape, then species like V. ferruginea may be forced into a downward spiral of \ndiversity loss if old growth remnants, which harbour higher diversity, are cleared and \nsecondary blocks are used as reforestation sources.  \n \nIntroduction \nSpatial genetic structure in plant populations is primarily brought about by limited \npropagule dispersal (Epperson, 2000). Most tropical forest canopy trees occur at low \ndensity in old growth forest and so long distance seed and\/or pollen dispersal are \nexpected (Degen et al. 2001; Ward et al., 2005; Hardesty et al. 2005). As a result, they \noften show little population genetic structure (Dutech et al., 2002; Latouche-Hall\u00e9 et al., \n2003; Lowe et al., 2003; Ward et al., 2005; Hardesty et al., 2006). However, unlike the \nmajority of tropical canopy trees, pioneer species often occur at locally high densities \nbecause of their light-demanding, gap-colonising strategy. In addition, when large scale \ndisturbances occur, such as following hurricanes or forest clearance, pioneer species may \ndominate forest regeneration, forming large stands (Boucher et al., 1994; Boucher and \nMallona, 1997). These dense populations may be founded by the offspring of very few \nindividuals and as a result genetic structure is largely a consequence of seed dispersal \nduring initial recolonisation (Hamrick et al 1993; Dick et al., 2003b; Dutech et al., 2003; \nSezen et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2006). Pioneer species thus have the potential to exhibit \nstrong fine-scale genetic structuring within recently recolonised stands. However, several \ncharacteristics of pioneer species would also lead us to expect that spatial genetic \nstructuring would be reduced in old growth forest compared to recently established \nsecondary forest. First, random mortality and competition effects over time will reduce \nindividual densities as stands mature, potentially reducing the number of individuals \nwithin spatially structured half-sib communities. Second, high individual densities in \nsecondary forest cause overlapping seed (and pollen) shadows, lowering the probability \nthat subsequent progenies are siblings (Vekemans and Hardy, 2004). Third, since pioneer \nspecies require distance dispersal to utilise forest gaps or recolonise cleared areas, genetic \nstructuring within old growth forest is expected to be disrupted over time due to extensive \nongoing gene flow (Slatkin, 1985; McCauley, 1991, Alvarez-Buylla and Garay, 1994, \nWhite et al., 1999; Dick et al., 2003a; Vekemans and Hardy, 2004).  \n \nColonisation of cleared areas also has the potential to introduce a genetic bottleneck in \nthe demographic cycle of pioneer species due to limited propagule sourcing (Dlugosch \nand Parker, 2007; Lowe et al., 2005), and the few studies of tropical trees from secondary \nforest confirm this expectation (Symphonia globulifera, Aldrich and Hamrick, 1998; \nSwietenia macrophylla, Cespedes et al., 2003; Elaeocarpus grandis, Rosetto et al., 2004). \nIndeed a study of colonisation in the palm Iriartea deltoidea (Sezen et al., 2005) found \nthat although gene flow via seed dispersal was high into regenerated stands, the \nreproductive dominance of a few old growth parents had strong genetic consequences and \ngenetic diversity was much lower than in old growth forest.  \n \nFor Vochysia ferruginea, a study examining chloroplast and AFLP variation across Costa \nRican populations (Cavers et al., 2005b) found that total genomic variation was reduced \nin secondary forest on recently cleared sites compared to old growth or lightly disturbed \nforest. However the density of trees in secondary forest was typically much higher than in \nold growth forest, and so a question remains as to whether the difference observed in \ngenetic diversity between secondary and old growth forests is a consequence of spatial \nsampling (small scale vs large scale) or an actual change in population dynamics due to \nrecolonisation. In addition, for many species we have limited knowledge of whether \ngenetic bottlenecks are recoverable over time or whether effects compound over \ngenerations. Finally, in most cases we have very limited understanding of the \ncolonisation and seed dispersal dynamics between remnant and recolonised sites, with \nwhich to guide landscape scale genetic management and resourcing in neotropical trees. \n \nHere we undertake a study of fine-scale genetic structure, genetic diversity and genetic \ndifferentiation across different sites and incorporating different demographic stages (old \ngrowth vs recently recolonised populations). We use the neotropical tree, Vochysia \nferruginea as our case study species since its life history characteristics fit the theoretical \nframework of a species likely to be genetically impacted by clearance\/recolonisation \ndynamics, the species has been the subject of ecological studies and due to its strong \nregeneration ability it has potential economic importance in the neotropics. The species, a \nlong-lived pioneer (Flores, 1993), occurs at low density in neotropical old growth forest \nbut colonises disturbed areas, such as abandoned agricultural land, forming dense stands. \nIts high tolerance of the low nutrient levels and high iron\/aluminium concentrations \ntypical of such sites, have made it a candidate for land reclamation projects (Finegan, \n1992).  \n \nThe study has two components. In the first component, we use AFLP markers to examine \nthe diversity and fine-scale genetic structure within four Costa Rican populations of \nvarying exploitation history and density, including one site that has recently regenerated \nfrom a cleared area (Florencia), two lightly disturbed sites (Ca\u00f1o Negro and Brasillea) \nand an old growth forest fragment (Volc\u00e1n). For these sites we independently examine \nthe impact of site history and population density on genetic diversity, and for the recently \nrecolonised site (Florencia) we infer seed-mediated colonisation dynamics. In the second \ncomponent we use nuclear microsatellite markers to compare spatial genetic structure, \ngenetic diversity, genetic differentiation and inbreeding across three generational cohorts \n(old growth forest, neighbouring recolonised secondary forest (colonised with last 50 \nyears) and seedlings resulting from secondary forest) at two additional sites in Costa Rica \n(Tirimbina and Ladrillera).  \n \nResults \nComponent 1 \nSpatial genetic structure \nAnalysis of spatial genetic structure using AFLPs indicated significant positive \nautocorrelation within the Florencia population at a short spatial scale (up to 10 m) and \nsignificant negative autocorrelation at the 30 m class (Fig 2a). Such a pattern suggests \nthat genetically similar individuals are clustered in groups of approximately 20 m in \ndiameter. No significant positive autocorrelation was evident at short spatial scales for \nthe other populations (Fig 2b,c,d), although in Brasillea and Volc\u00e1n significantly negative \nautocorrelation was recorded at 100, 130 and 170, and 70 m respectively, and may \nindicate larger spatial aggregations in these populations. In Ca\u00f1o Negro, significant \nspatial structuring was recorded at 2400 m (Fig 2e), although, due to the dispersed nature \nof the population, it is difficult to assess the significance of this result without further \nsampling.  \n \nGenetic diversity  \nFor all parameters of genetic diversity estimated from AFLP profiles (Table 2), Florencia \nwas the least diverse population. Volc\u00e1n and Brasillea were the most diverse populations \nand Ca\u00f1o Negro had intermediate diversity. The order and magnitude of this relationship \nbetween populations was retained after a standardising correction was applied to \nsubsample individuals over the same spatial scale (i.e. removing density effects; Table 2).  \n \nSpatial aggregation of genetic groups \nThe fine-scale pattern of genetic structure evident at Florencia was subject to further \ninvestigation. Individual pairwise genetic distance estimates were used to construct a \nNeighbour-Joining dendrogram (Fig 3). Clusters of genetically similar individuals were \nlabelled as groups (1 to 10) and mapped onto the original tree coordinates, along with dbh \n(Fig 4). The spatial clustering of closely related individuals is evident from this plot and \nexplains the high spatial autocorrelation at fine scale observed within this population.  \n \nComponent 2 \nSpatial genetic structure \nBased on SSR screens, old growth forest populations from both Tirimbina and Ladrillera \nshowed the lowest intensity of spatial genetic structure (average Sp = 0.01259, see Table \n3). Greater structuring was found in secondary forest populations (average Sp = 0.0358), \nand seedlings had similar intensities of spatial genetic structure to secondary forest \npopulations (average Sp = 0.0358, see Table 3). \n \nAt Tirimbina, significant spatial genetic structuring in the old growth forest was evident \nonly from 10 m to 30 m (see Fig 5). In secondary forest, significant spatial structure was \nfound at 8 m. Significant structure was also observed at 30 m to 50 m. At distances of 90 \nm and 190 m individuals showed significant negative autocorrelation, i.e. lower genetic \nrelatedness than would be expected in a random distribution. \n \nAt Ladrillera, no significant spatial genetic structure was found at the smallest spatial \nscales (below 50 m) in old growth forest, but significant structure was observed at 50 m \nand 90 m (Fig 6). In secondary forest, spatial structuring at the smaller scales was strong, \nwith the population showing significant relatedness from 4 m up to 30 m. Spatial \nstructure then decreased, but between 90 m and 190 m, individuals showed significant \nnegative relatedness. \n \nSeedling populations were sampled at a smaller spatial scale than adults. At both sites the \nrelatedness coefficient, r, was higher than in old growth and secondary forest populations, \nindicating that seedlings in both populations were more genetically similar than adults \n(see Figs 5 and 6). At Tirimbina weak structure was found at the smallest distance class \nof 4 m. At Ladrillera the seedling population showed a peak of genetic structuring at 8 m, \nand at 70 m individuals were significantly less related than expected. \n \nGenetic diversity \nRemnant old growth forest populations had higher diversity (expected heterozygosity, \nmeasured using SSRs) and greater allelic richness than 25 and 40 year old secondary \nforest stands (Table 3). The seedling cohort regenerating in neighbouring pasture showed \nreduced diversity compared to old growth and secondary forest, and regeneration from a \nsingle year showed lower diversity than seedling cohorts accumulated over several years \n(seedling stands 1 and 2; HE = 0.47 and 0.74 respectively).  \n \nThe two sites showed similar patterns in the changes of allelic richness between different \npopulations but varied for heterozygosity (HE Table 3). At Ladrillera, heterozygosity and \nallelic richness decreased from old growth forest (0.68 and 5.71 respectively) to \nsecondary forest (0.60 and 4.50 respectively), and to seedling cohorts (0.47 and 3.48 \nrespectively). At Tirimbina, across the same gradient, heterozygosity stayed relatively \nconstant (HE = 0.72-0.74), whilst allelic richness dropped from old growth forest (8.86), \nto secondary forest (7.95) to the seedling cohort (4.76). At Tirimbina the greatest \ndiversity was found in old growth fragments (HE = 0.77), although they exhibited very \nlow allelic richness (1.82).  \n \nPopulation differentiation and inbreeding coefficients \nAt Tirimbina, the old growth forest was most genetically similar to the old growth \nfragments (all genetic differentiation, FST, results estimated from SSR data in Table 4), \nwas weakly differentiated from the secondary forest block (FST = 0.036), but showed \ngreater differentiation from the seedlings (FST = 0.068). Secondary forest individuals also \nshowed weak differentiation from the seedling cohort (FST = 0.041). At Ladrillera, old \ngrowth forest was moderately differentiated from the secondary forest (FST = 0.089), and \nthe seedling population adjacent to it (FST = 0.069).  \n \nMost populations had low or negative values for the population inbreeding coefficient, \nFIS (see Table 3). An excess of homozygotes was observed in the seedling population at \nTirimbina (FIS = 0.11), but not at Ladrillera. There was an excess of heterozygotes \nobserved in the secondary forest populations at Tirimbina (FIS = -0.136) and Ladrillera \n(FIS = -0.157).  \n \nDiscussion \nPhases of clearance and recolonisation for pioneer trees are expected to have a strong \ninfluence on genetic structure and diversity. However studies to date have not fully \nconsidered how population density may interact with diversity effects, or the outcome of \na multigenerational colonisation sequence on population structure and diversity. In \naddition, in many cases the contribution of the colonisation process and the role of \nneighbouring forests to the composition of regenerated stands remains unresolved. \nUnderstanding such dynamics for a pioneer tree like V. ferruginea, and being able to \npredict genetic parameters from population history, will be a tremendous advantage for \nconservation and forest managers wishing to maximize genetic diversity and potential \nresilience at a landscape scale. \n \nSpatial genetic structure \nBoth AFLP and SSR studies found that old growth forest had minimal spatial genetic \nstructure. This observation is expected for a pioneer species, which is mainly a gap \ncolonist in old growth forest due to a combination of successional decline as it is out-\ncompeted by shade-tolerant forest trees and effective dispersal from adults at longer \ndistances. The hermaphroditic flowers, although self-compatible (Bawa et al., 1985) are \npredominantly outcrossing (Davies, 2006), and are visited by hummingbirds and large \ninsects (bees and butterflies). Its mating system therefore allows selfed seed to be set \nwhere pollen donors are absent, but also facilitates long distance pollen transfer and \ntherefore the potential for genetic mixing over time. \n \nEven in blocks of relatively disturbed forest (i.e. Ca\u00f1o Negro and Brasillea), there is little \ndifference in fine-scale genetic structure compared to an old growth forest fragment \n(Volc\u00e1n). Thus disturbance itself appears to have done little to disrupt populations of V. \nferruginea, although fire and logging may have opened up gaps within the forest that are \nsuitable for recolonisation by V. ferruginea.  \n \nThe highest level of spatial structuring was found in secondary forest, with individuals in \nclose proximity being more genetically similar than expected under random distribution. \nSignificant positive spatial autocorrelation at the lower distance scales (1-15 m) suggests \na structure of family clusters (Levin and Kerster, 1974; Sokal and Oden, 1978; e.g \nIriartea deltoidea, Sezen et al., 2005) due to founder effects, with patches of related \nindividuals from limited seed donors. The family clusters were at approximately 20 m in \nFlorencia (AFLP), 8 m in Tirimbina (SSR), and 4-8 m in Ladrillera (SSR).  \n \nIn old growth forest there was no spatial structure at the shortest spatial scales (Volc\u00e1n, \nLadrillera and little at Tirimbina). This was in contrast to other studies which have shown \ngenetic stucture in gap populations of some species, e.g. episodic recruitment in gaps \nfollowing an El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (Jacaranda copaia; Jones and Hubbell, 2006; \nCecropia obtusifolia, Alvarez-Buylla and Garay, 1994). \n \nGenetic diversity \nAs predicted genetic diversity was negatively impacted by disturbance history and \nclearance\/ recolonisation cycles in V. ferruginea. For example, the old growth forest \nremnant at Volc\u00e1n harboured the highest level of genetic diversity (all measures), \nwhereas the recently recolonised site, Florencia, had the lowest levels of diversity. The \ntwo old growth forest sites with a history of disturbance (Brasillea, and Ca\u00f1o Negro) \nmaintained intermediate levels of diversity. These diversity differences remained evident \nafter a correction was applied to standardise sample area and population density. Also at \nTirimbina and Ladrillera sites, secondary forest blocks had reduced genetic diversity and \nallelic richness as measured by SSR (Tirimbina HE = 0.72, RT = 7.95; Ladrillera HE = \n0.60, RT = 4.50) compared to old growth forest (Tirimbina HE = 0.75, RT = 8.86; \nLadrillera HE = 0.68, RT = 5.71), and represent a relative decrease in allelic richness of \n10% and 21%, respectively.  \n \nOther studies of regeneration by pioneer species have found a resistance to loss of \ndiversity with colonisation. Investigating the response of Swietenia macrophylla to \nregeneration into pastures, C\u00e9spedes et al. (2003) found that newly colonised populations \nhad relatively high levels of diversity, presumably due to high levels of gene flow (as \nfound previously, White et al., 1999; C\u00e9spedes et al., 2003). However, other studies have \nfound decreases in diversity due to bottlenecking in founder populations similar to this \nstudy. For example, Sezen et al. (2005) found that, after colonisation, founder \npopulations of Iriartea deltoidea showed significantly reduced diversity.  \n \nA further significant decrease in genetic diversity was observed in seedling cohorts using \nSSR variation (Tirimibina HE = 0.74, RT = 4.76; Ladrillera HE = 0.47, RT = 3.48) relative \nto both secondary (allelic richness decrease of 40% and 23% respectively) and old \ngrowth stands (allelic richness decrease of 46% and 39% respectively). The lower allelic \nrichness in seedling populations is an expected result of the loss of alleles during \ncolonisation by a low number of seed donors, although the effect was greater at \nTirimbina than Ladrillera. At Ladrillera, pastureland was cut yearly and most seedlings \nand saplings were of similar height (ranging from 5 to 390 cm in height with the majority \nunder 100 cm). In contrast, the abandoned plantation at Tirimbina was less regularly cut \nso more than one generation of seedlings are likely to be present with seedling and \nsapling height ranging from 12 to 640 cm. The increased loss of seedling diversity \nobserved at Ladrillera is likely a result of recruitment from a single year and consequent \nreproductive bias (cohort effect). Regeneration by successive generations may counter \ndiversity loss in founding populations. Indeed, this reduction of dependency on single \nreproductive events is one of the benefits that trees gain from the high investment of the \ntree lifeform (Petit & Hampe 2006). In other scenarios, like species invasions, multiple \nintroductions have also been found to augment diversity and increase allelic variation \nover time (Austerlitz et al., 2000; Dlugosch and Parker, 2007; Wilson et al., 2009; Prentis \net al., 2009).  \n \nThe genetic diversity results also highlight some anomalies. At Tirimbina, the old growth \nfragments consisted of three small isolated hilltop populations each containing a very \nsmall number of adult trees. These remnant trees are geographically widespread, which \naccounts for the high diversity of this group of adults, whilst the small population number \nis consistent with the low allelic richness estimate.  \n \nOverall the diversity of microsatellite variation for V. ferruginea adult populations ranged \nfrom 0.60 to 0.75. There is a considerable range of diversity found in other pioneer \nspecies, with HE ranging from 0.37 (Antirhea borbonica, Litrico et al., 2005) to 0.81 \n(Swietenia macrophylla, Lemes et al., 2003), and ranging between 0.42 and 0.64 in \ndifferent populations of Elaeocarpus grandis (Rossetto et al., 2004).  \n \nGenetic differentiation and family cohort  \nMore detailed study of the family structure and genetic differentiation at recolonised sites \ngave some insight into the colonisation process and the mechanisms by which spatial \ngenetic structure is established and genetic diversity lost.  \n \nExamination of the spatial distribution of genetic clusters at Florencia using AFLPs was \nparticularly informative. Of the trees that were sampled, many belong to groups of \ngenetically similar individuals (Fig 3), which cluster in close proximity at the site (Fig 4, \ne.g. groups 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9). It appears likely that these clusters represent sibling \ngroups derived from codistributed seed or are the product of seed rain from early \ncolonisers of the site. Indeed some of the trees sampled from this population had reached \ndiameters of more than 50 cm and are therefore likely to have arrived at the site soon \nafter clearance and, given the relatively rapid generation time of this species (15 years), \nwould have had enough time to mature and produce a second generation.  \n \nInvestigations into population differentiation and inbreeding coefficients for generational \ncohorts at Tirimbina and Ladrillera using SSRs are also highly informative with respect \nto the colonisation process. For both sites, secondary forest blocks exhibited an excess of \nheterozygotes (Ladrillera FIS = -0.157; Tirimbina FIS = -0.136). Since random mating \nwith some selfing can be presumed to be the norm for V. ferruginea (for old growth \nforests FIS = 0.016-0.175, also see Davies, 2006), such heterozygosity excess indicates \nsignificant levels of full and half sibs within these secondary forests. Indeed the \nsecondary forest population at Tirimbina was potentially founded by one very large \nremnant tree that was left in the area after clearing and has since died (B. Finegan pers. \nobs.). Ladrillera also has a landscape history of a small number of remnant trees left after \nclearing. The genetic character of these secondary forest populations suggests that small \ndifferences in the colonisation process, such as distance from source population and \npresence of remnant trees, have important consequences for levels of genetic \ndifferentiation, diversity and heterozygosity in the resultant secondary forest.  \n \nThe range of genetic differentiation estimates for V. ferruginea varied between FST =  \n0.069-0.112 at Ladrillera and 0.028-0.086 at Tirimbina. These values are within the range \nof differentiation found in other tropical tree populations, where low differentiation was \nfound for Dinizia excelsa (FST = 0.00167; Dick et al., 2003a) and high levels of \ndifferentiation have been found for Caryocar brasiliense (FST = 0.29; Collevatti et al., \n2001).  \n \nConclusions and management considerations \nThe structure of genetic variation in the secondary forests surveyed in this study offers \ninsight into the processes of seed dispersal and colonisation. However, the phenomenon \nof genetic bottlenecking during colonisation of pioneer species also has major \nimplications for the management of tree genetic resources. One would expect that genetic \nstructure within secondary forest would be disrupted and genetic diversity restored over \ntime by ongoing gene flow, and as the early-colonising cohorts senesce and slower-\ngrowing, longer-lived species become established in the canopy (Finegan and Delgado, \n2000). However, on the basis of its growth rate and maximum size, we predict that V. \nferruginea will remain the dominant species in secondary forest for more than 100 years \n(Finegan et al 1999a, b). Under this scenario, and for an area like northern Costa Rica \nwhere forest cover is greatly reduced and fragmented, seed rain at sites of active forest \nrecolonisation (e.g. logged forest and abandoned pastures) will not come from old-growth \nforest which harbours high genetic diversity, but from genetically bottlenecked sources in \nother heavily disturbed or cleared areas.  The genetic diversity of this species could \ntherefore be compromised, with adaptive and long term consequences. However as seen \nat Tirimbina, where multigenerational seedlings exhibited higher diversity than the single \ngeneration cohort at Ladrillera, there may be a significant role for pollen-mediated gene \nflow and mutli-generational seed rain to restore diversity in recolonised stands. \nConsidering the implications of this finding for the management of pioneer trees in \nincreasingly disturbed landscapes of the neotropics, we would recommend further studies \nof the dynamics of pollen flow from genetically diverse sources as a potential agent of \ngenetic rescue.  \n \n \nMethods \nVochysia ferruginea is widely distributed in the neotropics. It is hermaphroditic and \nalthough self compatible in controlled pollinations (Bawa et al., 1985), V. ferruginea \npopulations in both old growth and secondary forest have been found to be \npredominantly outcrossing (Davies, 2006). The fruit of V. ferruginea are mainly \ndispersed by wind and occasionally birds (Flores, 1993). Its tolerance to poor soils and \naluminium toxicity mean it can colonise the low fertility conditions typical of areas of \nland from which tropical forest has been removed for agriculture (Flores, 1993; Herrera \nand Finegan, 1997; Herrera et al., 1999). In fact, there is evidence that V. ferruginea \nbecomes more abundant in the low nutrient\/high acidity soils of abandoned agricultural \nland than under more natural situations (Herrera and Finegan, 1997; Herrera et al., 1999). \n \nVochysia ferruginea quickly colonises disturbed areas to become a dominant species of \nsecondary forest below 1000 m.a.s.l. and is occasionally found as a canopy tree in old-\ngrowth forests, usually on slopes or less fertile soils (Finegan 1996, Herrera & Finegan \n1997). It is one of the fastest growing trees in lowland Mesoamerican moist forests, large \nas an adult, and potentially long-lived; in a logged forest at  Tirimbina, northern Costa \nRica, Finegan et al. (1999a,b) recorded median annual dbh increments between 1.5 cm \nand 2 cm for the population > 10 cm dbh, the largest tree observed at their site reaching \n114 cm dbh.  V. ferruginea is a vigorous long-lived pioneer species that can disperse over \nwide areas and recolonise cleared sites quickly (Herrera & Finegan 1997). In rural Costa \nRica, V. ferruginea is commonly allowed to colonise abandoned agricultural land: the \nspecies\u2019 natural dispersal, fast growth and environmental tolerance enabling colonisation \nfrom neighbouring forest, even where the species is present at low density.  \n \nComponent 1 \nFrom each of four V. ferruginea populations (Brasillea, Ca\u00f1o Negro, Florencia, Volc\u00e1n; \nFig 1), 45-50 individuals were collected (Table 1), which provides a suitable population \nsize for conducting a spatial genetic analysis using AFLPs (Cavers et al., 2005a; Kremer \net al., 2005). Individual trees were sampled for leaf or cambium tissue (Colpaert et al., \n2005), which was dried on silica gel. The location of sampled trees was recorded using \npolar coordinates and site maps were constructed (Figure 1). Populations were defined as \ngroups of reproductively mature trees within a specified area (which varied between \npopulations depending on density, Table 1).  \n \nGenomic DNA was extracted using a modified CTAB protocol (Harris, 1995). The AFLP \nprotocol was as described in Vos et al. (1995), using four Eco+2 \/ Mse+4 selective primer \ncombinations: E-CG \/ M-TACT, E-GC \/ M-CTGC, E-GC \/ M-CACA, E-CC \/ M-CACA. \nAFLP fingerprints were visualised on a LICOR-IR sequencer, with the EcoRI selective \nprimer labelled with an IR fluorescent tag (IRD 700 \/ 800, MWG Biotech). Reactions \nwere denatured for 5 mins at 95 \u00b0C prior to loading, then 1\u03bcl of reaction was loaded onto \na 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (LongRanger\u2122 Gel solution, BMA) prepared \naccording to manufacturers instructions and including treatment with AG\u00ae501-X8 resin \n(Biorad), filtration and degassing prior to polymerisation. To maximize consistency and \nminimize scoring errors, approximately 5% of individuals were rescored, and gels were \nrun during a single period and scored by a single person. Gels were scored for presence \/ \nabsence of bands and a binary matrix was prepared.   \n \nGenetic\/spatial autocorrelation of fine-scale population structure was examined using \nTanimoto\u2019s distance using the software package Spatial Genetic Software (Degen et al., \n2001). For each neighbourhood distance class, the observed Tanimoto distance (D (obs)), \nand a positive and a negative measure of the 95% confidence intervals (D (-CI) and D \n(+CI)) were provided. These latter values were based on 1000 resamplings of genotypes \namongst the existing tree coordinates. If D (obs) falls outside of the D (+CI), then there is \na significant autocorrelation at that distance class.  \n \nPopulation genetic diversity parameters, Nei and Shannon\u2019s diversity indices, percentage \nof polymorphic loci and effective allele number were calculated using POPGENE (Yeh, \n1998). To control for the scale difference between study sites, 10 individuals were \nresampled at random, without replacement, within a standard 0.25 ha area for each \npopulation. The procedure was repeated 10 times for each data set and the mean and \nstandard deviation values for the above statistics calculated.  \n \nTo investigate the nature of spatial genetic structure at Florencia, the site which exhibited \nsignificant fine-scale spatial genetic structuring, pairwise Tanimoto\u2019s distance between \nindividuals was used to construct a Neighbour-Joining dendrogram; clusters of samples \nfrom the dendrogram were plotted on the site map to examine the spatial organisation of \ngenetically similar cohorts in more detail. \n \nComponent 2 \nIn northern Costa Rica\u00b4s San Juan \u2013 La Selva Biological Corridor (10\u00b0 34\u2019N, 84\u00b0 06\u2019W), \ntwo lowland sites of tropical wet forest containing old growth forest and an area of \nsecondary forest were selected (Tirimbina and  Ladrillera; Fig 1). At both sites the \nsecondary forest boundary was adjacent to agricultural land that was either recently \nabandoned or minimally managed with seedling regeneration found as secondary forest \nencroaches. The first site was at Tirimbina Biological Reserve (Finegan et al., 1999a) and \nconsists mainly of old growth forest with small patches of secondary forest that is 25-45 \nyears old. Adjacent to the secondary forest is an area of land that has been cleared and \nused as a plantation for palms, here there is abundant but patchy regeneration of V. \nferruginea. Seedling and saplings at this site ranged in size from 12 to 640 cm are likely \nto be the product of a multigenerational cohort and were sampled randomly for study. At \nTirimbina site there are also three isolated fragments within 2km of the old \ngrowth\/secondary\/seedling blocks sampled. All individuals from these \u2018fragment\u2019 \npopulations were sampled (n=12) and included in the analysis for comparative purposes.  \nThe second site, Ladrillera S.A., a privately owned cattle farm, (Finegan et al., 1999a) \nconsists of approximately 25 year old secondary forest, with a large old growth forest \nfragment. In one area where high-density V. ferruginea dominated secondary forest is \nadjacent to sloped pastureland, there is a high incidence of seedling regeneration and a \nnumber of remnant V. ferruginea trees present. The seedling and saplings at this site \nranged in height from 5 to 390 cm, with the majority under 100 cm, and due to the \nfrequent slashing of this pasture are likely the product of a single generational cohort.  \n \nTo identify spatial genetic structure an ideal sampling strategy was defined as 100 \nindividuals in a homogenous forest block approximating, where possible, a square plot, \nrather than transect (Cavers et al., 2005a). In each population 100-140 adult trees over 10 \ncm DBH or seedlings were exhaustively sampled from a defined block area (old growth \nvs secondary forest blocks vs seedling regeneration) until the target number of \nindividuals was obtained. At Tirimbina, populations were sampled from within old \ngrowth and secondary forest. At Ladrillera the whole old growth fragment was sampled \nand a secondary forest block 100 m from the old growth forest and adjacent to \nregenerating V. ferruginea in pasture. At Tirimbina and Ladrillera seedlings and saplings \nwere sampled from plantation and pasture respectively. At Ladrillera, 100 seedlings in a \ncontinuous population were sampled but in Tirimbina, due to the very high number of \nseedlings, a random sample was taken. Each adult tree was mapped by measuring \ndistance and angle from GPS points. Cambial tissue was taken from adult trees (Colpaert \net al., 2005) and leaf material was collected from seedlings and dried on silica gel.  \n \nDNA was extracted from leaf and cambial material using a commercial extraction kit \n(DNeasy 96 Plant Kit, QIAGEN). All molecular analyses were performed using a suite of \nmicrosatellite markers within nuclear genomic DNA. A set of primers had been \npreviously developed for V. ferruginea (Lowe et al., 2002) and populations were \nscreened for variation at five of those loci, A1-5, A1-10, A1-15, A1-20 and A1-35. The \ngeneral PCR protocol was: 1-5 ng DNA, polymerase buffer (1x volume, Promega), 0.2 \nmM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 \u03bcM of each primer, 2 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, \nAnachem), \u00bd unit Taq polymerase (Promega), and made up to a final reaction volume of \n15 \u03bcl using dH20. Amplification of PCR products used a touchdown protocol as follows: \ninitial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 minutes; a touchdown program of 95 \u00b0C for 15 seconds, \n65 \u00b0C for 25 seconds, 72 \u00b0C for 35 seconds for 11 cycles (where the annealing \ntemperature decreased by 1 \u00b0C per cycle); followed by a further 25 cycles with the \nannealing temperature at 55 \u00b0C; and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 15 minutes.  \n \nFine-scale spatial genetic structure within mapped populations was analysed using spatial \nautocorrelation. Relatedness was assessed using a multi-locus pairwise relationship co-\nefficient (Wang 2002), which jointly estimates two-gene and four-gene coefficients of \nrelatedness between individuals from an outbreeding population (Wang, 2002; Hardy and \nVekemans, 2002). Statistics were computed using the program SpaGeDi (Hardy and \nVekemans, 2002), with values of the spatial statistic Sp derived by dividing -b-log (the \nregression slope of  pairwise relatedness values on the logarithm of distance) by the mean \npairwise relatedness co-efficient at the smallest spatial scale. At each site individual \nlocations (populations) were randomised among all individuals with 1000 permutations.   \n \nAllelic richness and unbiased genetic diversity (Nei, 1987) within populations were \nestimated for each of five microsatellite loci and averaged over all loci, with significance \ntested using 1000 bootstraps. The inbreeding co-efficient (FIS) was estimated over all loci \nfor all populations, following Weir and Cockerham (1984). All estimates were obtained \nusing the program FSTAT 2.9.3 (Goudet, 2001). Genetic differentiation (FST) between all \npairs of populations was estimated following Weir and Cockerham\u2019s (1984) multilocus \nweighted analysis of variance using the program GENEPOP 3.4 (Raymond and Rousett, \n1995). Again, significance was tested using bootstrap sampling with 1000 simulations.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to acknowledge the European Commission DG RESEARCH INCO-DEV \nfor financial support as this work was partially funded as part of the EU INCO project, \nContract Number ICA4-CT-2001-10101.

A significant (95%) observed correlation \nbetween genetic distance and distance class is indicated if points are plotted outside of \nthe limits of the confidence interval plots. If the observed correlation is below the \nlower 95% CI line then individuals within that distance class have lower genetic \ndistances between one another (i.e. are more genetically similar) than expected at \nrandom and a significant positive spatial structure is observed. If the observed \ncorrelation is above the upper 95% CI line then individuals within that distance class \nhave higher genetic distances between one another (i.e. are less genetically similar) \nthan expected at random and a significant negative spatial structure is observed. \n \na) Volcan b) Florencia \nc) Brasillea d) Cano Negro (small scale) \nd) Cano Negro (large scale) \n 6\n0.1\n49\n53\n62\n52\n46\n56\n42\n48\n50\n77\n83\n87\n85\n86\n78\n80\n89\n84\n76\n75\n73\n74\n69\n72\n88\n82\n90\n71\n70\n41\n43\n45\n68\n58\n66\n54\n67\n61\n64\n44\n57\n55\n63\n51\n65\n60\nGroup 2\nGroup 1\nGroup 3\nGroup 4 \nGroup 5\nGroup 6 Group 7\nGroup 8\nGroup 9\nGroup 10\n \n \nFigure 3: Neighbour joining dendrogram of individual pairwise Tanimoto\u2019s distances \ncalculated for AFLP profiles for individuals from Florencia secondary forest.
