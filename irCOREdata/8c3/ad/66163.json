Saul Kripke and Hilary Putnam famously claimed that to be gold\nis to have atomic number 79 and to be water is to be H2O. I relate the first claim to\nthe concept of element in the history of chemistry, arguing that the reference of element\nnames is determined by atomic number. Compounds are more difficult: water is so\ncomplex and heterogeneous at the molecular level that \u2018water is H2O\u2019 seems false under\nsome interpretations. I sketch a response to this problem.\n1. Introduction. Chemical substances are the central kinds of chemistry,\nas important to understanding that science as the species concept\u2014if there\nis just one\u2014is to understanding the biological sciences. They are elements,\ncompounds, or mixtures: elements are just those that have no other chem-\nical substances as components. Here are three claims about elements: in\nthe eighteenth century, long before any direct investigation of atomic\nstructure, chemists used element names with determinate extensions; mem-\nbership of those extensions was conferred by having atoms with particular\nnuclear charges; and the chemical facts that make all this so were unknown\nuntil the twentieth century, so if they are known now they must have been\ndiscovered.\nThe determinate extensions of \u2018hydrogen\u2019, \u2018oxygen\u2019, and other element\nnames were picked out via the intentions with which the element names\nwere used, for substances that could survive chemical change, be com-\nponents of other substances, and whose presence could explain a com-\n\u2020To contact the author, please write to: Department of Philosophy, Durham University,\n50 Old Elvet, Durham DH1 3HN, UK; e-mail: r.f.hendry@durham.ac.uk.\n\u2021I would like to thank Joseph LaPorte and Paul Needham for their comments on\nprevious versions of this article, and Valentin Ostrovsky for the nuclear reaction ex-\nample in Section 3. I am also grateful to the Leverhulme Trust for leave during which\nI researched the article and the British Academy for funding my travel to the PSA\nmeeting.\nCHEMICAL KINDS 865\npound\u2019s behavior. The only special thing about \u2018hydrogen\u2019 and \u2018oxygen\u2019\nwas that they were chemical neologisms, introduced by Antoine Lavoisier\nin the 1780s. This is relevant because other elements like gold, iron, lead,\nand sulfur had been known and named since ancient times. If an element\u2019s\nname was used without the \u2018elemental intentions\u2019, then either its extension\nwas to some extent indeterminate, as Joseph LaPorte argues (2004), or it\nwas determined in some other way. I do not know when these intentions\nfirst appear, but they seem necessary though not sufficient for the emer-\ngence of modern chemistry.\nThe three claims about elements add up to a strong case for micro-\nstructuralism. Microstructuralism about a natural kind is the thesis that\nmembership of that kind is conferred by microstructural properties.\nKripke and Putnam advanced microstructuralist claims about biological\nspecies (tigers and lemons) and chemical substances (gold and water), but\nbiological microstructuralism seems implausible given the wide micro-\nstructural variation within biological species. Perhaps membership of bi-\nological kinds is conferred instead by historical or causal relations to\nparticular populations of organisms. Or perhaps, as John Dupre\u00b4 argues\n(1993), different kind-membership conditions are appropriate to different\nclassificatory interests and modes of biological explanation. Now these\narguments\u2014against microstructuralism and for pluralism\u2014are local to\nbiology. Chemistry, I argue, is different: the interests that govern its clas-\nsifications are more unified, and in most cases membership of its kinds\nis conferred by microstructural properties.\nIn Section 2, I give a semantic and historical argument for micro-\nstructuralism about the elements: since the late eighteenth century, ele-\nments have been named within a framework of modal assumptions that,\ngiven the laws governing chemical behavior, pick out nuclear charge as\ndetermining the application of the name. Compounds are more difficult:\nI have no general argument for microstructuralism about them, so instead\nI will respond to some important criticisms of it by Paul Needham (2000,\n2002) and Jaap van Brakel (2000). Perhaps arguments for, or against,\nmicrostructuralism about compounds ought to be made case by case. In\nSection 3, I will discuss one famous philosophical example: water.\n2. Elements. In 1787, Lavoisier and others proposed a reformed nomen-\nclature for chemistry, in which the names of compound substances would\nreflect their elemental composition. Phlogistonists complained that the\nnew nomenclature was theoretically laden, embodying substantial com-\npositional claims, illegitimately embedding the reality of oxygen in the\nvery language of chemistry, and excluding phlogiston, its explanatory role\nusurped jointly by oxygen and caloric, the matter of heat (see Beretta\n1993, Chapter 4). The binomial nomenclature survives in modern chem-\n866 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nistry, along with key elements from the list of simple substances in La-\nvoisier\u2019s Traite\u00b4 Ele\u00b4mentaire de Chimie (1789, 175\u2013176). What conception\nof element underlay these innovations? Interestingly, there are two quite\ndistinct conceptions: one explicit and one implicit.\nIn the preface to the Traite\u00b4, Lavoisier proposed an analytical definition\nof \u2018simple substance\u2019 to supplant a priori metaphysical speculation about\nthe ultimate principles of which things are made: he undertook to treat\nsubstances as simple until \u2018experiment and observation\u2019 prove otherwise\n(1789, xxiv). While it is widely associated with Lavoisier\u2019s name, this\ndefinition of element was not original to him. Nor is it what motivated\nhis uses of the names of particular elements like oxygen in chemical ex-\nplanation. Furthermore, he applied the analytical criterion only patchily.\nHe excluded many substances that had not been decomposed in the lab-\noratory from his list of simple substances: some (like soda and potash)\nbecause by chemical analogy he suspected them of being compounds;\nothers because he thought they contained as components one or more of\nhis hypothetical elements (caloric, the ether, the fluoric radical) and, hence,\nmust be compounds (see Hendry 2005, Section 2).\nThe new compositional nomenclature embodied another, implicit no-\ntion of element, which is also at work in Lavoisier\u2019s thinking about chem-\nical substances: only this second notion can explain the role of oxygen in\nLavoisier\u2019s theory of acidity. Lavoisier had noted in the 1770s that air is\nabsorbed in the formation of nitric, sulfuric, and phosphoric acids. By\nthe time of the Traite\u00b4 he had concluded that acids are a chemical genus\nwhose characteristic component is oxygen, and whose differentiae are\nvarious acidifiable \u2018principles\u2019 like azote (nitrogen), sulfur, and phospho-\nrus. When oxygenated to a higher degree, the principles form stronger\nacids: compare sulfurous and sulfuric acids, phosphorous and phosphoric\nacids, and nitrous and nitric acids. In the Traite\u00b4 Lavoisier provided a\nsummary table of oxygen\u2019s compounds with various other elements (1789,\nfacing page 185). If oxygen can be the common component of a range of\ndifferent substances, it must be capable of surviving chemical change. If it\ncan bestow acidity on its compounds, it must at least partly determine their\nbehavior. Hence Lavoisier\u2019s implicit notion of element, embodied in his use\nof the names of particular elements in chemical explanation, is the notion\nof a substance that (i) is a component of other substances, (ii) can survive\nchemical change, and (iii) whose presence can explain the chemical and\nphysical behavior of its compounds. Oxygen was not unique in being the\nsubject of these assumptions: Lavoisier thought caloric to be the charac-\nteristic chemical component of \u2018ae\u00a8riform fluids\u2019, or gases (1789, 15).\nMoving on to the nineteenth century, D. I. Mendeleev made Lavoisier\u2019s\nimplicit notion of element quite explicit, distinguishing between the two\ndifferent notions that we have already seen in use by Lavoisier: on the\nCHEMICAL KINDS 867\none hand, there is chlorine the poisonous green gas that F. A. Paneth\n(1962) called a \u2018simple substance\u2019; on the other hand is chlorine the com-\nponent of common salt and hydrogen chloride (Paneth\u2019s \u2018basic sub-\nstance\u2019). Chlorine the green gas is not present in salt but is used up in its\nformation. Mendeleev also noted that basic substances, rather than simple\nsubstances, occupy the places in the periodic table, because those places\nare allotted on the basis of properties of the compounds as well as of the\nfree elements (i.e., simple substances). Mendeleev noted the explanatory\nrequirements on basic substances and reasoned that they must carry from\ntheir simple substances to their compounds some property that determines\ntheir behavior in the different contexts. He identified the property in\nquestion as atomic, or elemental, weight (see Hendry 2005, Section 3).\nIn 1923, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n(IUPAC) proposed to redefine \u2018element\u2019 in the light of isotopy: the existence\nof atoms with the same atomic number, but different atomic weights (see\nKragh 2000, Section 3). Paneth had earlier (in 1916) argued for nuclear\ncharge as the defining property of the elements, pointing out that even\nthough isotopes are not identical in their behavior\u2014there are thermody-\nnamic differences consequent on their different masses\u2014they are chemically\ninterchangeable, in the sense that they undergo the same chemical reactions.\nThe redefinition was the subject of prolonged debate: before the funda-\nmental relationship between nuclear charge, electronic structure, and chem-\nical behavior was understood, nuclear charge seemed to some chemists more\nof a physicists\u2019 property, of little relevance to chemistry. Furthermore, the\nredefinition broke with the idea, handed down from Dalton, that elements\nare composed of identical atoms. Nor did the discussion end with the\nIUPAC decision. In the 1930s, when the different isotopes of hydrogen\nwere discovered, Ida Noddack argued that, since they can be separated\nby electrolysis, protium (1H) and deuterium (2D) are not chemically iden-\ntical. Now, once it is realized that atoms that were once counted as being\nof the same element (like 35Cl and 37Cl) have different masses, it is obvious\nthat the \u2018atomic weights\u2019 measured by nineteenth-century chemists like\nMendeleev pertain not to single species of atoms but to populations of\natoms: chlorine\u2019s atomic weight of about 35.5 is a weighted average dom-\ninated by 35Cl (76%) and 37Cl (24%). Given that it makes no sense to\nclassify atoms according to the statistical properties of heterogeneous\nensembles to which they happen to belong, to argue for the retention of\natomic weight as the basis of the periodic table is a radical stance, not a\nconservative one, requiring wholesale reform of the periodic system.\nHence Noddack proposed a system of some 260 isotope-elements (Kragh\n2000, 442\u2013443). Ironically, it seems that Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table, with\nits clear presentation of chemical trends and analogies, could be preserved\nin 1923 only by changing the property that defined each place in it.\n868 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nJoseph LaPorte (2004, 103\u2013110) puts isotopy to good use in a thought\nexperiment that turns the philosophical lesson of Putnam\u2019s \u2018Twin Earth\u2019\non its head. LaPorte considers a group of scientists, trained before the\ndiscovery of isotopy, who travel to a planet where heavy water (2D2O) fills\nthe rivers and lakes. Observing (among other differences) that Earth fish\nsoon die when placed in the Twin Earth \u2018water\u2019, the scientists conclude\nthat it is a different substance from water. Isotopy is discovered back on\nEarth while they are away, but the scientists who stayed at home decide\nthat deuterium is hydrogen and that heavy water is water. Do the traveling\nscientists make a mistake? LaPorte argues not: regarding heavy water as\nfalling within the extension of \u2018water\u2019 was a decision that was taken when\nisotopy was discovered. Prior usage was indeterminate.\nNow the differences in behavior between isotopes are subtle and quan-\ntitative\u2014thermodynamic and kinetic\u2014rather than gross and qualitative.\nThese differences can be magnified in striking ways and underlie the pro-\ncesses of their separation. For instance, heavy water is mildly toxic be-\ncause, compared with protium oxide, it slows down various metabolic\nprocesses by a factor of 6 or 7. This is enough to kill fish, which cling to\nlife within a narrow band of kinetic viability. The kinetic differences shown\nby hydrogen\u2019s isotopes are far more marked than those for other elements,\nhowever, because isotope variations are marginal effects, determined by\npercentage differences between their atomic weights: adding a neutron to\na heavier nucleus makes a smaller proportional difference. In fact, isotope\neffects diminish rapidly as atomic weight increases. Thus, for instance,\nreactions involving 37Cl are slowed down only by a modest factor of 1.01\nor so with respect to 35Cl. So the isotope effect in hydrogen is an extreme\ncase: a monster, not a paradigm. In other cases, atomic charge is the\noverwhelming determinant of chemical behavior, and atomic weight is a\nnegligible factor. Now this establishes only that, given the global facts\nabout isotopic variation, IUPAC\u2019s decision to count deuterium as hy-\ndrogen was by far the most natural one. A response to LaPorte\u2019s argu-\nment, however, must show more: that prior usage of \u2018hydrogen\u2019 picked\nout a determinate extension, that membership of the extension was earned\nby having a particular nuclear charge, and that atomic weight was irrel-\nevant. The scientific realist\u2019s view of the matter, that these things were\ndiscovered rather than stipulated, is tenable only if this prior determinacy\ncan be established. That argument I will now supply.\nConsider again Lavoisier. He had the ability to prepare samples of\nhydrogen in the laboratory. His preparation methods gathered popula-\ntions of atoms with a nuclear charge of 1, regardless of their atomic\nweights. As a matter of fact his atomic populations would have consisted\noverwhelmingly of 1H, but that reflected his starting materials, not his\nmethods of preparation. Lavoisier intended element names to refer in-\nCHEMICAL KINDS 869\ndifferently to their different states of chemical combination and assumed\nthat the presence of an element in a compound explained the chemical\nproperties of the compound. His theories of acidity and the gaseous state\nboth make these assumptions, about oxygen and caloric respectively. Fi-\nnally, of the candidate properties that survive chemical change, it is nuclear\ncharge, and not atomic weight, that overwhelmingly determines the chem-\nical behavior of both elements and compounds, via the electronic structure\nof free and bound atoms. Hence Lavoisier\u2019s intentions uniquely pick out\nsameness of nuclear charge as the important similarity relation for ele-\nments, given the laws that govern the causal processes he was interested\nin explaining. LaPorte\u2019s semantic indeterminacy does not arise for the\nnames of the elements because they were given in a semantic context that\nwas structured by implicit modal assumptions about the elements. Of\ncourse, \u2018heavy water\u2019 names a compound rather than an element, but the\nsame factors that make isotopic differences irrelevant to element identity\napply also to compounds. As long as the same interests govern the ex-\ntension of compound names, if deuterium is hydrogen then heavy water\nis water.\n3. Compounds. If elemental composition were sufficient to determine\nchemical-kind membership for compounds, extending my argument for\nmicrostructuralism to compounds would be simple, though nontrivial.\nHowever, isomerism makes elemental composition insufficient. Isomers are\ndistinct compounds with distinct chemical and physical properties that con-\ntain the same elements in the same proportions. For instance, ethanol\n(CH3CH2OH), the active ingredient of whisky, boils at 78.4\u0001C. Methoxy-\nmethane (dimethyl ether, CH3OCH3) is sometimes used as an aerosol pro-\npellant and boils at \u000124.9\u0001C. Clearly the distinctness of ethanol and\nmethoxymethane as substances must lie in their different molecular struc-\ntures, but the appeal to structure is vague and problematic in a number\nof ways, as Needham (2000, 2002) and van Brakel (2000) have pointed\nout. First, sameness of molecular structure is a vague relation, and this\nvagueness will be inherited by criteria of sameness of substance that de-\npend on it. Second, some compound substances are heterogeneous at the\nmolecular level: even when pure they are complex mixtures of different\nmicroscopic species.\nMolecular structure is defined in terms of continuous variables like\ninternuclear distances and angles between bonds. Therefore the similarity\nof one molecular geometry to another is a vague, and so an intransitive\nrelation. Hence it is not an equivalence relation between molecular struc-\ntures, dividing them into mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive exten-\nsions for chemical kinds. Interatomic geometry will instead group mol-\necules into vague-bounded, overlapping clusters of similar structures.\n870 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nThough vague at their edges, these molecular kinds will typically center\non the low-energy equilibrium geometries that characterize stable chemical\nsubstances. This need not always be so: chemists often give systematic\nnames to unstable species. For instance, carbonium ions are reactive in-\ntermediates formed in organic reactions, whose structures and relative\nstabilities are important in explaining the mechanisms and products of\nadditions to alkenes (see, e.g., Roberts and Caserio 1965, 182\u2013184). The\nobvious response to this problem of vagueness, then, is to embrace it, for\nit presents no antinomy. In any case, given the vast numbers of molecules\ninvolved, vagueness will inevitably infect the relationship between molec-\nular species and macroscopic substances.\nTurning now to molecular heterogeneity, the slogan \u2018water is H2O\u2019 might\ntempt one to think of bodies of water as mere assemblages of H2O mol-\necules. That identification is challenged by the recognition that real water\nis far from homogeneous at the molecular level (Needham 2000). First,\na small but characteristic proportion of the H2O molecules in any body\nof pure water\u2014a proportion that varies with temperature\u2014dissociates via\nthe following equilibrium:\n\u0002 \u00012H Os H O \u0002OH .2 3\nSecond, undissociated H2O molecules are polar: they display permanent\nelectric dipoles, amounting to partial charges centred on the hydrogen\nand oxygen nuclei. Strong interactions between the permanent electric\ndipoles of H2O molecules greatly increase the melting and boiling points\nof water in comparison to the hydrides of other elements in its group\n(H2S, H2Se, and H2Te). The polarity also gives rise to oligomolecular\nspecies in which H2O molecules are linked by hydrogen bonds between\ncenters of opposite partial charge. These polymeric species are similar in\nstructure to ice and affect water\u2019s physical properties, like its viscosity,\nright up to its boiling point. In short, macroscopic bodies of water are\ncomplex and dynamic congeries of different molecular species, in which\nthere is a constant dissociation of individual molecules, reassociation of\nions, and formation, growth, and dissociation of oligomers. Being H2O,\nif understood as a molecular condition, cannot capture the molecular\ncomplexity of water.\nOne might defend the identification of bodies of water with mere as-\nsemblages of H2O molecules by regarding the ions and oligomers as some-\nthing other than water, natural impurities that arise from chemical inter-\nactions between H2O molecules. On this view, however, bodies of water\nhave a short, and necessarily impure, existence. What we thought was a\npersisting sample of water we now see as a series of fleeting existences,\ncausally connected. Leaving aside that unsavory consequence, it is quite\nunnatural to view the ions and oligomers as impurities. The transport\nCHEMICAL KINDS 871\nproperties of H3O\n\u0002 and OH\u0001 ions are responsible for the electrical con-\nductivity of water, so if they are impurities in water then what is normally\ncalled the electrical conductivity of water (and measured as such) is not\na property of water, but of an aqueous solution of its ionic dissociation\nproducts. Conversely, if the electrical conductivity is a property of the\nwater, the dissociation products must be part of the water. The transport\nstory is complex: hydrated protons display anomalously high mobility in\nwater because protons themselves need not move very far through the\nliquid. Instead there is a coordinated process of structural diffusion (the\nGrotthus mechanism). A proton migrates from one H2O molecule to its\nneighbor, which releases a proton to its neighbor, and so on, so that the\nexcess positive charge of hydronium ions is transported through the water,\nbut not the ions. This transport mechanism makes it even less plausible\nto view the protons as anything but integral parts of the water and of\nthe mechanism underlying its electrical conductivity. Now turn to the\noligomers: these are similar in structure to ice (one might regard them as\nmicroscopic nascent ice crystals). If the formation of ice is to be a phase\nchange rather than a change of chemical substance, the oligomers must\nbe water too. Ice is water in the chemists\u2019 phase-unqualified usage of\n\u2018water\u2019 in which one can ask how much water there is on Mars. Hence\nthe oligomers are water. I conclude then that samples of water are not\nmere assemblages of H2O molecules. But then what are they?\nNeedham (2000) and van Brakel (2000) see bodies of water as macro-\nscopic objects whose microstructure may be investigated empirically. The\nmicrostructure may even explain some properties of water, but according\nto Needham and van Brakel, it does not follow from this that water\u2019s\nmicrostructure is what makes it water. I agree that water is a macroscopic\nsubstance and that the molecular complexity issue shows that samples of\nwater are complex and dynamic entities, heterogeneous at the molecular\nlevel, and relatively independent of the water molecules they contain.\nNevertheless, being water should be understood in terms of composition\nby H2O molecules. After all, how else can we make some water except\nby creating, or bringing together, some H2O molecules? We must be care-\nful, however, in how we interpret \u2018composition\u2019. Composite objects may\nbear different relations to their parts. Some composites are mere assem-\nblages. Even some bodies of water are mere assemblages: consider, for\ninstance, a very diffuse cloud of H2O molecules strung out in empty space\nbetween two distant stars. In other cases, the composition involves dy-\nnamic causal interaction. Consider some H2O molecules brought together\nat standard temperature and pressure, interacting spontaneously. They\nform liquid water, and as we have seen, some of them dissociate, new\nones form, and so on. Some H2O molecules are \u2018used up\u2019 in the process,\nlike the eggs in a cake. Now distinguish between two kinds of part: com-\n872 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nponents persist in the composite, while ingredients need not persist\u2014they\nmay be used up in forming the composite. Components and ingredients\nparticipate in the structure of a composite in different ways: components\nby persisting, ingredients by offering their parts. Water, then, is the sub-\nstance that has H2O molecules as its ingredients, though many of them\nwill in fact live on in the water. Turning back to the elements for a moment,\nit is easy to see the relationship between water and its constituent elements,\nhydrogen and oxygen. Considered as simple substances, hydrogen and\noxygen are ingredients. As basic substances they are components, their\npersistence underwritten by the continued existence of the nuclei and their\ncharges.\nWe may allow that composition be reflexive, so that single H2O mol-\necules count as water. For Needham and van Brakel, only macroscopic\nbodies of stuff can be water, because only macroscopic bodies can bear\nthe thermodynamic properties\u2014melting point, boiling point, and so on\u2014\nthat are normally used to identify water. However, even if thermodynamic\nproperties are used to identify water, it does not follow that they are what\nmakes it water, and when we ask, for instance, how much of the human\nbody is water, the answer is independent of the display of any thermo-\ndynamic properties in vivo. If so, the possession of macroscopic properties\ncannot be necessary. It also seems natural for the extension of \u2018water\u2019 to\ninclude individual H2O molecules, because general claims about water\nought to apply to them. If they do count as water, individual H2O mol-\necules are the smallest items that can qualify as water on their own ac-\ncount. Hydroxyl ions and protons, in contrast, qualify as water only as\npart of a larger body.\nMy proposal, then, is that water is the substance formed by bringing\ntogether H2O molecules and allowing them to interact spontaneously. One\nconstraint should be emphasized, however. Consider the following decay\nchain, beginning when 16O absorbs two protons:\n1 16 18 18 18H O r Ne r F r O.2\nThis reaction seems to be a theoretical possibility: Coulombic repulsion\nbetween the protons and the oxygen nucleus normally provides a for-\nmidable energy barrier, but resonances between excited states of 1H2\n16O\nand 18Ne allow for nonvanishing transition probabilities. Experiments to\nsee whether the theoretical possibility is realized are inconclusive (see\nBelyaev et al. 2001), but the mere possibility is, at first glance, a problem\nfor my account of water\u2019s identity if it is to have any counternomic ro-\nbustness. The exotic isotope 18Ne is formed from an H2O molecule through\na spontaneous internal interaction. Is it water, then, on my account? No:\nsameness of elemental composition provides a necessary, though insuffi-\ncient, condition for sameness of substance. It is necessary because elements\nCHEMICAL KINDS 873\nsurvive in their compounds, their survival underwritten by the survival\nof the nuclei, as we saw in Section 2. It is insufficient because isomers\nexist: different substances with the same elemental composition. The 18Ne\nis not water, then, because the basic substances hydrogen and oxygen are\nused up in making it. The elemental composition condition on substance\nidentity requires that elements be components of substances, not mere\ningredients.\nI have spent a lot of time on one case: water. This is not only because\nPutnam chose it as a widely cited example but also because, as Needham\nand van Brakel make clear, its molecular heterogeneity poses important\nquestions to the microstructuralist. Also, an informed debate can proceed\nbecause extremely detailed information on the structure of water has been\ngathered (Franks 1972\u20131982), perhaps because of the ubiquity and im-\nportance of water as a solvent. I have attempted to square the thought\nthat the H2O molecule is characteristic of water with the fact that samples\nof water survive the destruction of individual H2O molecules. My strategy\nhas been to focus on dynamic composition, that is, how samples of water\nare brought into being. My proposal may be too broad: I have placed no\nlimits on what proportion of the characteristic molecules must survive.\nMaybe an ad hoc restriction is required. Alternatively, there may be an-\nother way of identifying the characteristic molecule that does not rely on\ndynamic composition.\nOther compound substances present fewer problems to the micro-\nstructuralist. Some are simply more uniform as collections of molecules,\nwhile others are typically encountered as components of mixtures, rather\nthan as (relatively) pure macroscopic samples. In either case there is less\nopportunity for the extensions of the substance terms to come apart from\nthe extensions of the names of their characteristic molecular species.\n4. Conclusion. The microstructuralist case for the elements seems strong.\nA single microstructural property, nuclear charge, persists through the\nvarious manifestations of an element and is central to explaining the\nbehavior that historical figures like Lavoisier used to classify substances\nand then name them. Compounds, as we have seen, are more problematic\nand complex, so that microstructuralism about compounds will need to\nbe assessed case by case, and water is only one. I have two further com-\nments to make about the scope of the microstructuralist claim.\nFirst, chemistry names kinds at different mereological and logical levels.\nApart from individual compounds and substances, it names kinds of at-\noms, ions, molecules, elements, and compounds, as we have seen, and\nalso higher kinds like metals and acids. Microstructuralism clearly fails\nfor one higher kind, the acids. As Ian Hacking (1983, 84\u201385) and Kyle\nStanford and Philip Kitcher (2000, Section V) point out, no microstruc-\n874 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\ntural feature unites the acids and the bases; instead there has been a\nsuccession of definitions of acidity that do not corefer, though they do\nagree on certain core cases. Hacking is right to argue that the question,\n\u201cIs it an acid?\u201d cannot be answered without qualification. We can ask,\n\u2018Is it a Lewis acid?\u2019 or, \u2018Is it a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid?\u2019 and so on, answering\nto nothing deeper than relevant definitions. While this discontinuity is an\ninteresting phenomenon and shows that not all kind terms can be un-\nderstood in the same way, it does not reflect on other chemical kinds.\nWhen speaking of elements, chemists do not need to distinguish Lavoisier-\noxygen from Dalton-oxygen, Mendeleev-oxygen, or IUPAC-oxygen. There\nis just oxygen, and a history of hypotheses about what characterizes the\nsubstance. These hypotheses do answer to something deeper: oxygen. The\nexistence of syndrome kinds is no refutation of microstructural accounts\nof the elements.\nWhat about \u2018water\u2019 and \u2018gold\u2019? Remember that \u2018oxygen\u2019 was a special\ncase, an antiphlogistic neologism. In contrast, \u2018water\u2019 and \u2018gold\u2019 were used\nindependently of chemistry, which brings us to a second scope issue: dis-\ncipline specificity. My argument concerning the elements relies on the\npresence of modal intentions that are characteristic of the epistemic in-\nterests of chemistry. Many substance terms are used in contexts that are\nnot governed by these interests. It is well known that the extension of\n\u2018jade\u2019 is not determined by microstructural similarities alone but also by\nvarious manifest properties (e.g., LaPorte 2004, 100). That may be so,\nbut then the term does not name a chemical substance. This is not a\nquestion-begging move but a substantial claim. The classificatory practices\nof a scientific discipline reflect its particular theoretical and explanatory\ninterests. In chemical company, I bet that every chemist will disambiguate\n\u2018jade\u2019 between jadeite and nephrite.\nREFERENCES\nBelyaev, V. B., A. K. Motovilov, M. B. Miller, A. V. Sermyagin, I. V.
