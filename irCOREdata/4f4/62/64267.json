INTRODUCTION\nThe problem of determining the wind\u2013induced response\nof a sea region or lake, particularly in stratified conditions,\nhas been an important and long\u2013standing issue in physical\noceanography. Early work by Platzman (1963) showed that\nstrong\u2013wind bursts could excite seiches in lakes with as-\nsociated changes in surface elevation. In its simplest form,\nthe lowest mode seiche is a free oscillation involving water\nmovement from one end of a lake to another. When the\nlake is stratified, topographic and rotation effects are im-\nportant and the response is very complex. Analytical work\n(Csanady 1972, 1973) investigated the problem of the wind\nresponse of constant\u2013depth circular and rectangular lakes\nwith linear stratification in the vertical (Csanady 1972) or\nin terms of two layers (Csanady 1973). Calculations with\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail address: phh@pol.ac.uk (P. Hall).\na circular lake showed that at the coastal boundary there\nwere narrow (of order 5 km) \u201dcoastal jets\u201d, with Poincare\u00b4\u2013\ntype waves in the centre. In the case of a rectangular lake,\ndepending upon its characteristics, odd number seiches are\ngenerated (Csanady 1973). In a narrow lake (Heaps and\nRamsbottom 1966, hereafter HR66), rotational effects are\nless important and can often be neglected. In such cases\nthe response of the region to a wind blowing along the axis\nof the lake is downwelling at the downwind end of the lake,\nwith upwelling at the opposite end as described in Csanady\n(1973). At the upwelling end, denser water is moved into\nthe surface layer, and convective mixing occurs giving rise\nto a stable water column. Later in this article, we show that\nthis gives rise to a relatively wide well\u2013mixed coastal region.\nHowever, at the downwelling end, lighter water is moved\nto depth in a narrow coastal layer. As the wind forcing de-\ncreases, the vertical displacement of the density surfaces is\nreduced by the restoring force of gravity, and internal waves\nwith associated fronts (Simons 1978) propagate from the\nPostprint of article published in Ocean Dynamics (2005) 55: 248\u2013271 18 July 2007\nlateral boundaries into the interior of the region. Owing to\nthe differences in mixing at upwind and downwind coastal\nboundaries the response is not anti\u2013symmetric, and conse-\nquently, there are differences in the propagation of inter-\nnal waves from each boundary into the interior. In larger\nlakes, rotational effects are important and can influence the\nwind\u2013induced circulation (Winant 2004). A detailed review\nof the response of lakes to wind forcing is given in Csanady\n(1996). The response of a large sea region such as the North\nSea [the northern part of which has water depths of the or-\nder of 250 m, and is stratified in summer (Heaps 1980)] is\nthe initial breakdown of the summer stratification in the\nautumn time, and the generation of major stormsurges in\nresponse to winter storms. In such a region, rotational ef-\nfects are important and influence the depth of penetration\nof the winds energy, and the generation of inertial oscil-\nlations and internal waves with strong shear at the level\nof the thermocline which are important in deepening the\nthermocline.\nThe objective of the present paper is to use a three\u2013\ndimensional non\u2013linearmodel [which has been extensively\napplied in realistic sea regions (Xing and Davies 2001b;\nXing et al. 1999)] in cross\u2013sectional form, to examine the\nimportance of horizontal grid resolution, (particularly in\nnear coastal regions where the internal waves are produced)\nupon the generation and propagation of internal waves. The\neffect of the value of horizontal diffusion upon this propa-\ngation is also considered. The model has a uniform finite\ndifference grid in the horizontal which can be refined in the\ncoastal region by the use of a transformation factor. The\ninfluence of a near coastal grid enhancement upon the sta-\nbility of the solution is also examined. Diffusion in the ver-\ntical is parameterized by either a fixed diffusion coefficient\nor one computed from a turbulence energy closure model.\nThe effect of changing the magnitude of the horizontal and\nvertical diffusion coefficient upon the width of the coastal\nboundary layer, and hence the grid resolution required to\nresolve this layer and the subsequent offshore propagation\nof internal waves is examined. In addition, the importance\nof horizontal resolution and offshore propagation of internal\nwaves upon the vertical diffusion computed with the turbu-\nlence energy model is also considered. The importance of\nincluding seiche motion within a turbulence energy model\napplied in lake conditions was recently shown by Goudsmit\net al. (2002). In a more general context, Davies and Xing\n(2003) for stratified seas and Xing and Davies (2005) for\na cold\u2013water dome, recently showed the importance of in-\ncluding internal\u2013wave propagation within a turbulence en-\nergy model in order to simulate mixing within the thermo-\ncline. The sensitivity and numerical stability of the solu-\ntion to changes in grid resolution and parameterization of\ndiffusion is examined in detail.\nIn essence, the focus of the paper is twofold: Primarily to\nexamine the accuracy and stability of a non\u2013uniform grid,\n(achieved by a transformation technique) when applied to\ninternal\u2013wave generation and propagation in a non\u2013linear\nhydrodynamic model; Secondly to examine the sensitivity\nof the solution to the parameterization of vertical and hori-\nzontal mixing and how this impacts upon the accuracy and\nstability of the solution. To determine these effects, a de-\ntailed comparison is made with a high accuracy non\u2013linear\nsolution derived on a fine uniform grid, namely, a bench-\nmark solution. In addition the analytical solution of the\nlinear problem is used to yield insight into the importance\nof boundary\u2013layer resolution.\nThe form of the three\u2013dimensional model and turbulence\nclosure model with brief details of their numerical solution\nis given in the next section. In section three an analytical\nsolution of a cross\u2013sectional linear model to a wind pulse is\npresented to yield some insight into the importance of res-\nolution in coastal boundary layers upon the wind\u2013induced\nresponse of a sea region. In subsequent sections, the numer-\nical results of the nonlinear problem with a range of uni-\nform and non\u2013uniform grids are presented and compared\nwith an accurate solution, with conclusions given in a final\nsection.\n2.

The terms SU , SV , ST represent the\nfull three\u2013dimensional momentum advection terms, with\nDU , DV , DT the horizontal diffusion terms. Details of the\nmathematical formulation of these terms are given in Xing\nand Davies (2001b). Horizontal viscosity (Am) and diffu-\nsivity (Ah) were given by Am=100 m\n2 s\u22121 and Ah=100 m\n2\ns\u22121. The influence of determining Am using a Smagorinsky\n(1963) formulation (Blumberg and Mellor 1987) is given by\nAm = C\u0394x\u0394y\n[(\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n)2\n+\n1\n2\n(\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n)2\n+\n(\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n)2] 1\n2\n(6)\nwith C an arbitrary scaling coefficient, and \u0394x,\u0394y hor-\nizontal grid spacing was also considered. The vertical\neddy viscosity and diffusivity are denoted by Av,Kv. In\nsome calculations these were specified, in others they were\ncomputed using a turbulence energy sub\u2013model Xing and\nDavies (1998, 2001b); Luyten et al. (1996, 2002); Bolding\net al. (2002).At the land boundary the normal component\nof flow was set to zero. At the seabed a linear friction law\nwas applied with a coefficient K=0.0005 m s\u22121, an ap-\npropriate value in a shallow region. For temperature the\nheat flux was zero at sea surface and sea bed. The surface\nstress was set equal to the wind stress. In all calculations\ndescribed subsequently the wind stress was increased si-\nnusoidally from 0.0 Pa at t=0, to 0.5 Pa at t=6 h with a\nsimilar reduction to zero at t=12 h, after which the stress\nwas zero. This was chosen to be consistent with Davies\n(1980) who used a functional model to examine the wind\u2013\ninduced response of the linear form of the hydrodynamic\nequations given here. In that model, as in the analytical so-\nlution of HR66 there was no temperature mixing, although\ntemperature advection occurred. Although details of the\nnumerical solution of these equations is given in Xing and\nDavies (2001b,a), it is worth stressing that temperature\nadvection was solved using a total variation diminishing\n(TVD) scheme described by James (1996). This method\nhas been very successful in advecting sharp density gradi-\nents associated with internal tides over steep topography\n(Xing and Davies 1998). By comparing the numerical so-\nlution derived here, using a range of uniform and variable\ngrids, against an accurate solution derived with a high\nresolution fine grid (the benchmark solution), the influ-\nence of grid resolution upon accuracy and stability can be\ndetermined. In addition, by using a range of mixing coef-\nficient values and parameterizations, their influence upon\nthe grid resolution required to achieve an accurate and\nstable solution can be determined. The analytical solution\nof HR66 and its application to a wind impulse problem\n(Davies 1980) are used to give insight into the nature of the\nphysics determining the solution, and the numerical impli-\ncations of the time decay of the solution. In the calculations\ndescribed later in order to examine the wind\u2013induced re-\nsponse of the upwind and downwind boundaries separately\nand make comparisons with an earlier calculation (Davies\n1980) a cross\u2013sectional model of the North Sea was used.\nTo be consistent with Davies (1980) and the analytical\nsolution of HR66, rotational effects were removed so that\nthe model had \u201dlake\u2013like\u201d characteristics, but the two\nboundaries were sufficiently well removed that they could\nbe studied separately. Consequently, in the calculations\ndescribed subsequently, the three\u2013dimensional model was\nused in cross\u2013sectional form with f=0. Hence there was\nno y dependency of the solution, and v=0 throughout.\nUnlike in the analytical solutions of HR66 (see below) or\nthe numerical solution of Davies (1980), vertical mixing of\ntemperature is allowed in the present model. Hence besides\nadvection of the temperature field by the wind\u2013induced cir-\nculation, a surface\u2013mixed layer and diffusion and mixing of\nthe thermocline can occur in response to wind forcing. This\nwill be discussed more in connection with the calculations.\n3. Analytical solution\nIn order to gain some insight into the accuracy of the nu-\nmerical model and appreciate the processes giving rise to\nthe flow fields in the model, it is useful to compare the solu-\ntion with that derived analytically from a two\u2013layer model.\nBy approximating the density distribution used in the nu-\nmerical model, by two homogeneous layers of thickness h1\nand h2 with density \u03c11 and \u03c12, an analytical solution of\nthe linear equations (HR66) for the free periods of both the\nsurface and interface displacement can be obtained. In this\nsolution, interfacial friction is assumed to be zero (HR66)\nalthough bottom friction is included. One important dif-\nference between layered and continuous models is that in a\ntwo\u2013layered model only the surface mode and the first in-\nternal mode together with their higher harmonics can be\ngenerated, whereas in a continuously stratified basin, an\ninfinite number of internal modes with higher harmonics is\npossible.\nWithout bottom friction, analytical solutions giving the\nperiods of the surface modes,\nTn =\n1\nn\n2l\nC1\n,with C1 = (gh)\n1\/2 where n = 1, 2, ...\u221e, (7)\nwith l basin length taken as 400 km and the first internal\nmode\nTn =\n1\nn\n2l\nC2\n,with C2 (8)\n3\n=[\ng\nh1h2\nh\n(\n\u03c1\n2\n\u2212 \u03c1\n1\n\u03c1\n2\n)] 1\n2\nwhere n = 1, 2, ...\u221e,\ncan be obtained (HR66).\nFrom Eq. 8 it is evident that the period of the internal se-\niche will be highly sensitive to density differences between\nthe upper and lower layers. Approximating the density dis-\ntribution used in the numerical model, by two layers h1=55\nm, h2=195 m, with \u03c11=1026.3 Kg m\n\u22123 and \u03c12=1027.5 Kg\nm\u22123 (see Fig. 1) gives using Eq. 8 a first internal mode se-\niche period of T1=317 h.\nFor the case in which internal displacements are gener-\nated by a suddenly imposed wind stress given by,\nFS = H(t)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nAnsin\n(n\u03c0x\nl\n)\n, (9)\nit is possible to derive an analytical solution (Heaps and\nRamsbottom 1966), for \u03b62 (the vertical displacement of the\ninterface between the layers in the two\u2013layered model), of\nthe form,\n\u03b62 = H(t)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nZ\n2\n(n)cos\n(n\u03c0x\nl\n)\n(10)\nIn Eqs. 9, 10 and 11, An is a constant, H(t) is the Heavyside\nunit function, and K is the coefficient of bottom friction\nin the two\u2013layer model. If the effect of friction upon \u03c3n is\nsmall, then Eq. 10 can be further simplified by assuming\n\u03c3n = C2 for all n (Heaps and Ramsbottom 1966).\nFourier decomposition of the wind stress used in the nu-\nmerical model yields,\nF2(x) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nAnsin\nn\u03c0x\nl\n(11)\nwhere\nAn =\n{\n4\/n\u03c0 (n odd)\n0 (n even) (12)\nConsequently only surface and internal seiches with n odd\nwill be present in the numerical solution.\nThe analytical solution presented above is for a suddenly\napplied and maintained wind stress. However, as shown by\nDavies (1980), this can be applied to a wind pulse of dura-\ntion \u0394t by linearly combining this solution with one corre-\nsponding to a suddenly applied wind stress in the opposite\ndirection, shifted in time by \u0394t. Since the analytical model\nis linear and only used here to understand the implications\nof physical processes upon the basin circulation and numer-\nical solution, the solution of Davies (1980) is sufficiently\naccurate to facilitate this. However, an accurate numerical\nsolution of the full nonlinear model (termed the benchmark\nsolution, see below) is required to quantify the accuracy of\nthe various grids.\n4. Numerical calculations.\n4.1. The \u201dbenchmark\u201d calculation with fixed diffusion\ncoefficients\nResults from the analytical solution presented previously\nfor a two\u2013layered linear model (in which there was no verti-\ncal diffusion) showed that the initial response was a narrow\ncoastal region of significant downwelling at the downwind\nend of the basin. The linear nature of the solution and lack\nof mixing meant that there was an associated identical up-\nwelling at the other end of the basin (Davies 1980).\nIn the analytical model, the presence of the up\u2013 and\ndownwelling regions confined on the short time scale to\nthe coastal boundary, with no vertical motion outside this\nboundary layer, was represented by an infinite number of\ninternal modes. As time progresses, the higher\u2013order modes\nare damped more rapidly than the lower modes as the re-\ngion of up\u2013 and downwelling spreads from the boundary\ninto the interior. Since the spatial variability of lower modes\nis significantly less than for the higher modes, then as time\nprogresses, the solution will exhibit less horizontal spatial\nvariability and a coarser grid should be adequate. The ana-\nlytical solution therefore suggests that the crucial test of ac-\ncuracy is the near coastal response on the short time scale.\nIn order to examine if this conclusion holds in the non\u2013\nlinear numerical model and to understand the influence of\nvariable grid resolution, and parameterization of diffusion\nupon the solution, an initial high resolution \u201dbenchmark\u201d\n(BM) solution was developed with a uniform finite differ-\nence grid resolution of order of 60 m.\nIn this initial \u201dbenchmark\u201d calculation (Calc BM, Ta-\nble 1), following Xing and Davies (2001b,a), 27 sigma lev-\nels were used in the vertical, with enhanced resolution in\nthe surface wind driven high shear layer. The density and\neddy viscosity profiles (an identical eddy diffusivity was\nused) were as shown in Fig. 1, and corresponded to those\nused by Davies (1980). Horizontal eddy viscosity was taken\nas Am=100 m\n2 s\u22121 with diffusivity Ah=100 m\n2 s\u22121. The\nwind forcing and water depth together with basin dimen-\nsion were identical to those used in the analytical and nu-\nmerical solutions of Davies (1980). These parameters were\nfixed in all calculations unless stated otherwise.\nThe initial (up to 10 h) wind\u2013forced response (Fig. 2)\nis a surface wind\u2013driven current, with downwelling at the\ndownwind end of the basin, and upwelling at the opposite\nend. This gives a near coastal displacement of the temper-\nature surfaces and weak return flow at depth. The circula-\ntion in the basin is shown by the streamlines (Fig. 2, t=10\nh), with closely spaced streamlines indicating stronger cur-\nrents.\nAt the downwind (eastern) end of the basin, the wind-\nforced flow leads to a downwelling of the temperature sur-\nfaces in a region of the order of a couple of horizontal grid\nboxes wide. The resulting horizontal temperature gradient\ngradually propagates westward (Fig. 2, t=20 h) away from\n4\nFig. 1.

The reason for the westward propaga-\ntion is considered later. At the western end of the basin, up-\nwelling of colder (heavier) water (see temperature contours\nin Fig. 2) leads to some convective mixing, and horizontal\ntemperature gradient (albeit weaker than at the other end)\nwhich propagates away from the coastal boundary.\nAfter 40 h (Fig. 2, t=40 h) the temperature front and\nassociated downwelling generated at the eastern boundary\nhas now propagated about 100 km to the west (namely to\nx=300 km, Fig. 2, t=40 h). Similarly on the western side\nof the basin, the front that was evident at 20 h (Fig. 2)\nhas now propagated to about x=100 km. However, limited\nconvective mixing has weakened it compared to that at the\neastern end.\nThe lateral speed of propagation of these two fronts ap-\npears to be determined by the first internal mode period of\nthe basin. Although, the initial response of the basin is the\nexcitation of all horizontal modes, the first internal mode\nis the largest and has a period T1=317 h. This is associated\nwith a speed of propagation of the internal wave (Ci=2.53\nkm h\u22121). Hence after 40 h, based on the two\u2013layer analyt-\nical model, the temperature disturbance generated at the\nlateral boundaries has propagated 101 km. The close agree-\nment in the model suggests that the TVD method propa-\ngates the disturbance at the correct speed. In addition, as\nshown by Xing and Davies (1998), the TVD method also\nretains the sharp temperature gradient associated with the\nfront.\nIt is important to note that the wind\u2013forced surface cur-\nrent in the region of the eastern boundary is opposed by\nthe current that gives rise to the westward propagation of\nthe density front, leading to a reduction in surface current,\nand downwelling at the temperature front. Since the mag-\nnitude and depth of penetration of this wind\u2013forced current\ndepends upon the value of Av, then this parameter will in-\nfluence the intensity of the downwelling in the temperature\n5\n(a)\nFig. 2. Temperature contours (blue) and stream functions (black) over the whole basin at t=10, 20, 30, 40 h and t=80, 160 and 320 h,\ncomputed with the benchmark calculation BM (Table 1)\n6\n(b)\nFig. 2. (Contd.)\n7\nfront. This point will be considered later.\nOn the western side of the basin, the upwelling in the\nfrontal region, with a surface flow to the west opposes the\nwind\u2013forced surface current and gives a local downwelling\nat the western boundary at t=20 h which gradually propa-\ngates to the east. This second temperature front produced\nat t=20 h, due to a local coastal downwelling, has prop-\nagated about 25 km from the western boundary by t=40\nh. It is evident from Fig. 2 that since there is no convec-\ntive mixing associated with a temperature front produced\nby downwelling, these fronts are much sharper, than those\nproduced by upwelling.\nAs time progresses, the two initial (formed by the sud-\nden wind forcing) frontal systems propagate to the centre\nof the basin by t=80 h (Fig. 2). This is in close agreement\nto the time predicted by the speed of propagation based\non the analytical model. At this time the temperature sur-\nfaces in the eastern half of the basin are almost horizontal,\nas expected at t = 14T1 (i.e. approximately 80 h). Wind\u2013\ninduced mixing at the surface and downwelling on the east-\nern side of the basin leads to a well\u2013mixed surface layer\ngiving a sharper thermocline at about 50 m below the sur-\nface (compare Fig. 2, at t=0 and 80 h). The upwelling na-\nture of the flow on the west side of the basin and its sur-\nface advection after the windmixing period, leads to a sur-\nface temperature front which moves to the east. However\nby t=160 h, halfway through the internal seiche period, the\nsolution is more anti\u2013symmetrical about the centre of the\nbasin. Mixing below the thermocline increases the mean\ndepth of isotherms in the thermocline region. On the west-\nern side of the basin, convective mixing produced by up-\nwelling leads to a loss of the anti\u2013symmetry predicted by\nthe simple linear\u2013layered model.\nAs time progresses, internal seiche motion in the basin\nproduces downwelling at the western end, with correspond-\ning upwelling at the eastern end, giving rise to nearly hori-\nzontal temperature surfaces at t=160 h. Since both ends of\nthe basin have experienced upwelling and downwelling pe-\nriods by this time, the solution exhibits anti\u2013symmetrical\nfeatures about the centre (Fig. 2). After 160 h the higher\nmodes have been substantially damped, and the first in-\nternal mode corresponding to a linear anti\u2013symmetric ver-\ntical displacement of temperature surfaces, about a zero\ndisplacement in the centre of the basin remains.\nThe damping of the higher modes which are responsi-\nble for the initial coastal boundary layers can be seen in\nthe across basin variation with time of the temperature at\nabout 90 m below the surface (Fig. 3). It is evident that at\nt=40 h there is significant spatial variability in the bound-\nary layers due to contributions from the higher modes.\nDownwelling at the eastern end increases the temperature\nat 90 m below the surface (Fig. 3) and above its initial con-\ndition (about 9.1\u25e6C, that occurs in the centre of the basin)\ndue to the downwelling of warmer surface water. At the\nwestern side, upwelling moves colder bottom water up to 90\nm, producing a reduction in temperature.

As time\nprogresses, the horizontal modes are damped and a more\nlinear across basin temperature variation occurs (t=160 h)\nwhich then oscillates at about the period of the first internal\nseiche. The presence of vertical mixing in the model means\nthat wind\u2013induced temperature gradients give rise to en-\nhanced vertical mixing leading to a reduction by t=320 h\nof the temperature gradients. Also at a depth of 90 m, the\ndownward mixing of temperature due to wind\u2013forced dif-\nfusion leads to an increase in temperature (Fig. 3) as the\nwarmer surface water is mixed to depth.\nThis \u201dbenchmark\u201d calculation clearly shows that hor-\nizontal resolution will be particularly important in the\ncoastal regions on the short time scale when higher hori-\nzontal modes are present. The influence of viscosity upon\nthese boundary layers and hence grid resolution will be\ninvestigated in the next section.\n4.2. Influence of vertical and horizontal eddy viscosity\nand grid resolution upon the solution\nTo examine the effect of changes in horizontal and ver-\ntical eddy viscosity together with grid resolution, calcu-\nlations are performed with a range of uniform grids G1,\nG2, G3 with resolutions of 0.2, 2, and 20 km (Table 2)\nand subsequently with a refined grid in the boundary layer\nranging from 2 (nearshore) to 20 km (offshore) (G4), from\n0.2 (nearshore) to 12.3 km (offshore) (G5), and finally 0.2\n(nearshore) to 3.25 km (offshore) (G6). This grid refinement\nwas achieved using a coordinate transformation whereby\nthe grid gradually varied with distance from the coast,\nrather than grid meshing which involves a sudden change\nin grid resolution. The gradual grid refinement was incor-\nporated in the model by using a mapping technique in the\nhydrodynamic equations. By this means finite differencing\nwas still performed on a uniform grid which represented\na telescoping grid in physical space. Calculations (Table\n1) were initially performed using the eddy viscosity profile\nand values (Av) assumed by Davies (1980), although sub-\nsequently these values were reduced to 0.1 Av (Table 1).\nThe influence upon the solution of reducing horizontal eddy\nviscosity from a value AM=100 to 10 m\n2 s\u22121 was also con-\nsidered (Table 1, where A denotes calculation with higher\nviscosity and B with lower viscosity).\nAs discussed previously in terms of the \u201dbenchmark\u201d cal-\nculation, the initial response is at the coast, with the coastal\nboundary layer gradually propagating towards the centre\n8\nFig. 3. Contours of temperature at 90 m below the surface at t=40, 60, 120, 160, 240 and 320 h for the benchmark calculation BM (Table 1)\nof the basin. This is associated with a region of significant\nvertical velocity and strong horizontal gradient in the u\ncomponent of current. To gain some insight into the influ-\nence of grid resolution and viscosity upon the solution, we\nwill examine the spatial variability of the current at t=40\nh, when the boundary layer has propagated 100 km from\nthe coast (Figs. 4, 5).\nA cross\u2013sectional plot of stream function, velocity vec-\ntors and temperature (Fig. 4a(1)) from Calc 1A shows the\ncharacteristic up\u2013 and downwelling regions at 100 km from\nthe coast, caused by a combination of the surface wind\u2013\ndriven flow and internal\u2013wave propagation from the coastal\nboundary, as discussed previously. The solution with a 2.0\nkm grid (Calc. 2A) is not substantially different from that\nwith a 0.2 km grid (compare Fig. 4a(1) and (2)) (Calc. 1A).\nHowever, with a 20 km grid (Calc. 3A), the region of down-\nwelling vertical velocity at x=300 km is too wide, and the\nupwelling region is not adequately resolved (compare Fig.\n4a(1) and (3)).\nWhen the horizontal eddy viscosity is reduced (Calc. 1B),\nthe circulation computed with the 0.2 km grid (not shown)\nwas not substantially different to that determined in Calc.\n1A. Similarly, when a 2.0 km or 20 km grid was used there\nwas no substantial difference from those found with the\nhigher value of AM . In essence the solution was more sensi-\ntive to the grid resolution than to the value ofAM . This can\nbe understood in terms of the generation processes which\nproduce the horizontal gradient in u and the associated ver-\ntical velocity. Since grid resolution in the lateral boundary\nlayer has the major effect upon the magnitude of w and\nhence the gradient in u is clearly of primary importance.\nAs the gradient in u evolves with time it is smoothed by\nthe horizontal viscosity term. However, for the parameters\nused here the calculations show that the 0.2 or 2 km grid\ncan adequately resolve this gradient which is not particu-\nlarly sharp and hence not influenced to a large extent by\nAM .\nIn a subsequent series of calculations, (Calcs. 4, 5, 6) AV\nwas reduced to 0.1 AV . The effect of this reduction in AV\nis an increase in the surface\u2013wind driven current (Calc. 4A,\nTable 1) in the central part of the basin at t=40 h (Fig.\n4b(1)). This leads to an enhanced horizontal gradient in u,\nand downwelling in the frontal region. A comparable change\noccurs in the upwelling area, with the general circulation\nsimilar to that found with AV (compare Fig. 4a(1) and\nb(1)). Similar to the previous one, increasing the horizontal\nresolution to 2 km gave a comparable flow field (not shown),\nalthough with a 20 km grid the spatial distribution changed\nsignificantly (compare Fig. 4b(1) and (2)).\nA decrease in horizontal viscosity in the 0.2 km grid cal-\nculation (Calc. 4B) produced no significant difference in\nthe circulation (not shown) compared to that found previ-\nously (Fig. 4b(1)). However, on the 2 km grid (Calc. 5B), at\nthe upwelling end, two small gyres appeared in the vertical\nwhich were not present in previous calculations (compare\nFig. 4b(1) and (3)). These gyres appear to arise due to a\n9\n(a)\nFig. 4.

(Contd.)\ndown\u2013wind flow at the level of the thermocline, which at\nabout 30 km from the coastline produced an upwelling and\ndownwelling flow. Some indication of a comparable flow is\nevident at the downwelling end at about 3040 km from the\ncoast although it is less pronounced. This circulation ap-\npears to be a function of the value of AM and the grid reso-\nlution, in that there is no evidence for it in Fig. 4b(1). With\na 20 km grid resolution, the circulation (not shown) was\nnot substantially different from that given in Fig. 4b(1).\nTo consider the effects of variable grid resolution in de-\ntail, we will consider the case where vertical viscosity is 0.1\nAV and horizontal viscosity is low at AM=10 m\n2 s\u22121. At\nt=40 h, a cross basin plot of horizontal and vertical veloc-\nity at 90 m below the surface shows the gradient in hor-\nizontal velocity and the rapid increase in vertical velocity\n(Fig. 5a(1)) for a range of grids. A depth of 90 m below the\nsurface was chosen as this is the region of the thermocline\nwhere vertical velocity is a maximum. Increasing the hor-\nizontal grid resolution widens the coastal boundary layer\nwhich shows less spatial variability as the model does not\nhave sufficient resolution to adequately resolve the region\nof rapid change.\n15\n(c)\nFig. 5. (Contd.)\nThis is evident in the cross basin variation of the u cur-\nrent determined with the uniform 2 km grid (G2) or variable\ngrid (G5) which shows an artificial (compared with grids\nG1 or G6) variation close to the western coastal boundary.\nThis appears to be associated with the two vertical gyres\ndiscussed previously. In the case of the coarse grid (20 km),\nthe model cannot resolve the spatial variability of u cur-\nrent that occurs in the lateral boundary layer. The vertical\nvelocity w computed with the fine grid (G1) on the eastern\nside of the basin has a region of rapid change which is well\nresolved on the 0.2 km grid (G1), or on the variable reso-\nlution grids (G5 and G6). With the G4, G5 and G3 grids\nwhere the resolution is too coarse, there are major errors.\nExpanded versions of Fig. 5a(1) and (2), at the western\nside of the basin, namely, Fig. 5b(1) and (2), clearly show\nthat grids G1, G5 and G6 give comparable solutions. How-\never, G2 and G4 which use a 2 km grid in the boundary\nlayer are significantly different from the others. This sug-\ngests that a variable resolution grid with order 0.2 km in\nthe coastal region may yield an accurate solution.\nThe sensitivity of the solution to the horizontal grid res-\nolution is clearly evident from these calculations. For a\n16\n(d)\nFig. 5. (Contd.)\ngiven grid resolution, as the value of vertical eddy viscos-\nity is reduced the surface current increases giving enhanced\nup\u2013 and downwelling in the lateral boundary layers, and a\nsharper horizontal gradient in u and w. This suggests that\nas the surface eddy viscosity is reduced, then the horizon-\ntal gradient in u, and hence the vertical velocity associated\nwith it will increase; provided that the grid in the near\ncoastal boundary layer is sufficiently fine to resolve these\nfeatures. If the grid is too coarse in this lateral boundary\nlayer, then this important physical process will not be re-\nsolved.\n4.3. Calculations using a turbulence energy model to\ncompute AV and KV\nIn an initial calculation (Calc. 7A, Table 1) the turbu-\nlence energy model was used to compute the profile of ver-\ntical eddy viscosity. As the mixing length in the model\ndecreased to a small value in the surface layer, the eddy\nviscosity profile exhibited a small surface value, increasing\nwith distance below the surface to a value comparable to\nthat used in the fixed viscosity calculations. At the level\nof the thermocline it fell to near zero due to the suppres-\n17\nsion of turbulence by stable stratification. Below this level,\nexcept in the near bed region, shear was small, and hence\nturbulence production and eddy viscosity were negligible.\nThe effect upon the surface current of the small surface\nvalue of eddy viscosity is to appreciably increase the sur-\nface current (Fig. 4c(1)) compared to the one discussed\npreviously (Fig. 4a(1), b(1)), with an associated increase\nin u current gradient and downwelling velocity. A similar\nalthough less dramatic increase in upwelling also occurs,\nalthough the main features of the circulations are compa-\nrable (compare Fig. 4b(1) and c(1)). An increase in grid\nresolution to 2 km (Calc 8A) (Fig. 4c(2)), although pro-\nducing only a small change at the eastern end, does affect\nthe flow at the western end of the basin. With a coarse\ngrid (Calc. 9A), the regions of strong vertical velocity are\nremoved (Fig. 4c(3)).\nA reduction in horizontal viscosity (Calc. 7B), with a fine\nhorizontal grid (G1, Table 1), leads to a significant increase\nin u current gradient and vertical velocity which shows the\npresence of a small internal shock on the density surfaces\n(Fig. 4d(1)). As discussed previously, as the horizontal grid\nis increased (Calc 8B) (Fig. 4d(2)) a two gyre system in the\nvertical develops at the upwelling (western) end of the basin\n(Fig. 4d(2)). However, at the downwelling end, the internal\nshock is spread over a larger region with some evidence\nof small ripples behind the front. As before, a coarse grid\n(Calc. 9B) leads to a solution which only exhibits the large\u2013\nscale features of the detailed flow field found with the finer\ngrids.\nCross\u2013sectional plots of u and w velocity at a depth of\n90 m below the surface are given in Fig. 5c(1) and (2) for\nthe range of grid resolutions shown in Table 2. These show\nthat at the eastern end of the basin the main features of\nthe u velocity can be represented on all grids except the\ncoarse grid G3. However, as earlier, at the western end,\nonly the 0.2 km uniform grid G1 or variable grid G6 can\nadequately resolve the region, as shown in the \u201dblow up\u201d\nfigure (Fig. 5d(1)). For the w component of velocity, both\nthe sharp \u201dspike\u201d at the western side of the basin (Fig.\n5c(2) and d(2)) and the small horizontal scale with large\namplitude variation at the eastern side (Fig. 5c(2)) require\na grid resolution of order 0.2 km to adequately resolve them.\nThese calculations clearly show that as the surface vis-\ncosity is reduced, the surface\u2013wind driven flow increases\ngiving rise to a significantly larger downwelling current in\nthe coastal boundary at the eastern end of the basin. If a\nsufficiently fine grid and low enough horizontal viscosity is\nused in the calculation, then a sharp horizontal tempera-\nture gradient and associated vertical velocity propagates\naway from the boundary. With a coarse grid or large hori-\nzontal viscosity, this feature is removed from the solution.\nThe results suggest that a fine grid in the lateral generation\nregion may be sufficient to produce an accurate solution,\nsince as the analytic solution suggests high order modes are\nrapidly damped in time.\n4.4. Longer time integration solutions with a variable\ngrid resolution\n4.4.1. Constant horizontal diffusion coefficient\nThe previous series of calculations have shown that as\nvertical and horizontal viscosity are reduced, resolution\nwithin the lateral boundary layers becomes more impor-\ntant on the short time scale. However, as time progresses,\nsmall\u2013scale features associated with the initial excitation\nof higher modes propagate away from these boundary lay-\ners into regions where the grid is coarser. As shown in the\nanalytical solution, the damping of these higher modes is\nlarger than for the lower modes and consequently any dis-\nturbance that propagates from the lateral boundaries will\nbe damped with time. However, this could be a problem on\nan irregular grid where propagation into a coarse grid re-\ngion could lead to a spurious solution if the propagation to\nthe coarse grid region was rapid compared with the damp-\ning. This problem is examined in this section.\nIn calculation 10 (Table 1) grid G6 was used with a low\nvalue of Am and viscosity 0.1 Av. Contours of T, u, w at\n10\u2013h intervals up to 80 h at 90 m below the surface (Fig.\n6a) show a disturbance propagating away from each coastal\nboundary. Some indication of a Gibbs\u2013type oscillation in\nthe T field following the frontal region, as it propagates into\nthe coarser grid, is apparent, suggesting a lack of resolution\nin this region. It is evident that the intensity of the ripples\nparticularly on the T contours increases with time (Fig.\n6b). Any short waves that are produced on the longer time\nscale can transfer energy through non\u2013linear effects down\nto grid scale waves giving rise to an unstable solution.\nAdditional calculations (not presented) showed that in-\ncreasing Am introduced more horizontal smoothing giv-\ning a stable solution. This excessive smoothing, however,\nnegated the effects of having an enhanced resolution in\nthe lateral boundary layers. To avoid this problem a grid\u2013\ndependent horizontal viscosity, namely a Smagorinsky for-\nmulation, was examined.\n4.4.2. Smagorinsky formulation of diffusion coefficient\nIn an initial calculation (Calc 11) using Am computed\nwith the Smagorinsky formulation with C=0.2, a uniform\ngrid resolution of 0.2 km was employed. Although on the\nshort time scale up to t=80 h themain features of the T, u, w\nfields (Fig. 7a) were consistent with those found previously\n(Fig. 6a), it is apparent that at t=80 h the Gibbs\u2013type effect\nin the temperature field was not present. Similarly, on the\nlonger time scale there were no spurious oscillations in the\nT field, even though the spike associated with the vertical\nvelocity was resolved in the solution (Fig. 7b). From a com-\nparison with the benchmark solution (Calc BM) presented\nearlier (Fig. 3), it is evident that with a fine horizontal grid\nthe Smagorinsky solution is not significantly different (ex-\ncept for a reduction in the peaks in the vertical velocity\nfield) from that found previously with a low value of Am.\nTo examine to what extent the Smagorinsky formula-\n18\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 6.

As Fig. 6 but for Calc 12 (Am from the Smagorinsky formulation (C=0.2, grid G6))\n21\ntion (with C=0.2) could reproduce the benchmark solution\non the irregular grid the previous calculation was repeated\nwith grid G6 (Calc 12). From Fig. 8a it is evident that al-\nthough on the very short time scale (t\u00a120 h) the model can\nreproduce the disturbance coming from the coastal bound-\nary, on the longer time scale t=80 h, excessive horizontal\nsmoothing takes place (compare Fig. 8a with Calc 11 Fig.\n7a) as the disturbance reaches the coarser grid. In addi-\ntion, on the long time scale (t=240 h, Fig. 8b) none of the\nsmall scale structure found in Calc (11) is evident in the\ntemperature field. Similarly there are no spikes in the verti-\ncal velocity field (Fig. 8b, compared to previously Fig. 7b).\nThis excessive smoothing on the irregular grid using the\nSmagorinsky formulation with C=0.2 can be attributed to\nthe fact that the computed Am depends not only on hor-\nizontal shear but also on grid scale \u0394x which increases in\nthe coarse grid region of the model.\nContours of T, u, w computed using the irregular grid\n(G6) but with C=0.002 (Calc 13) up to t=80 h (Fig. 9a)\nare in excellent agreement with those found in Calc 11 (Fig.\n7a). However, it is apparent that the maximum value of\nw associated with the disturbance which propagates from\nthe coastal boundary has been reduced. On the longer time\nscale, the T and u distributions (Fig. 9b) are in good agree-\nment with those found with the high resolution uniform\ngrid (Fig. 7b) although the magnitude of the vertical ve-\nlocity spikes has been significantly reduced. Unlike previ-\nous calculations the use of a Smagorinsky formulation with\nC=0.002, with an irregular grid, does not introduce exces-\nsive smoothing, (hence negating the advantages of an irreg-\nular grid) or allow for a build\u2013up of grid scale energy on the\ncoarse grid, leading to a physically unrealistic solution. In\nessence, when the Smagorinsky formulation for Am is used\non an irregular grid, the value of C is critical in determin-\ning the solution. The determination of an optimum value\nof C will depend upon the degree of mesh refinement in the\ngrid, and will influence the solution.\n5. Concluding remarks\nThe problem of internal\u2013wave seiching in a wide basin\nhas been used to examine the physical processes giving rise\nto the horizontal propagation of small\u2013scale features from\nthe lateral boundaries into the centre of the basin. Calcu-\nlations have shown that this problem is ideal for examining\nthe influence of a variable grid upon the accuracy of the so-\nlution. By using a constant depth basin without rotational\neffects and an essentially twolayer density profile, an ana-\nlytical solution could be obtained which yielded significant\ninsight into the physical processes governing the solution\nand their role in determining an optimum grid size.\nOn the short time scale, the numerical solutions showed\nthat the response to a wind pulse was coastally induced\ndownwelling at the downwind end of the basin, and an as-\nsociated upwelling and convective mixing (in the numerical\nsolution) at the upwind end. This gave rise to an appre-\nciable non\u2013zero vertical velocity close to the coast which\ngradually propagates into the centre of the basin. By using\na long basin the two lateral boundaries were well removed\nand the horizontal propagation could be studied in detail.\nAssociated with the region of non\u2013zero vertical velocity was\na horizontal temperature front.\nCalculations using a fine (64 m) horizontal grid showed\nthat the TVD advection scheme in the model could accu-\nrately reproduce the lateral advection of this front. How-\never, as the horizontal grid became coarser this front could\nnot be formed in the coastal boundary and the numerical\nsolution departed from the accurate benchmark solution.\nAlso if horizontal eddy viscosity was increased the solution\nwas smoothed in the horizontal.\nThe intensity of the vertical velocity in the boundary\nlayer and the associated sharpness of the temperature gra-\ndient was also found to be sensitive to the value of vertical\neddy viscosity. With a low surface value of viscosity, the\nwinds momentum was confined to the surface layer rather\nthan diffusing to depth. This gave an enhanced near sur-\nface transport with increased up\u2013 and downwelling in the\ncoastal boundary layer and hence a sharper internal tem-\nperature front.\nCalculations using an irregular finite difference grid, with\nenhanced resolution in the coastal region and with low val-\nues of Am and AV , showed that as the temperature front\npropagated away from the coastal boundary into the coarse\ngrid region, a Gibbs\u2013type effect occurred behind the prop-\nagating front. This arose due to a lack of local grid resolu-\ntion. In addition, on the longer time scale non\u2013linear effects\nlead to short\u2013wave ripples in the large\u2013scale solution.\nSolutions derived with a high resolution (0.2 km) uni-\nform grid with Am computed using a Smagorinsky formu-\nlation with C=0.2 were not significantly different from the\n\u201dbenchmark\u201d solution. However, when a grid transforma-\ntion was used with the same value of C, significant smooth-\ning occurred as Am was increased in the coarse grid region.\nThis had the effect of negating the benefits of using a finer\ngrid in the boundary layers. A solution with C=0.002 and\nthe irregular grid was, however, in good agreement with the\nbenchmark solution.\nThese results showed the importance of maintaining a\nhigh resolution in the near coastal boundary layers. This\nhas been a common policy adopted in finite element models\nof shallow seas, where in order to resolve the coastal bound-\nary correctly a high resolution finite element grid was used.\nHowever, the calculations also demonstrate that in the case\nof stratified flows where internal waves generated in off-\nshore, (Davies and Xing 2003; Xing and Davies 2001b,a)\nor land regions (Davies and Xing 2004) subsequently prop-\nagate away from their generation region, as it is essential\nto maintain adequate grid resolution. In a coarse grid non\u2013\nlinear model, numerical instability can arise unless a scale\nselective filter is applied. One means of avoiding this is to\nuse the Smagorinsky formulation which takes account of\nlocal grid size and horizontal current gradients in deter-\nmining the value of Am. This approach selectively smooths\n22\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 9.
