In general, electro-optic coefficients are very weak and a medium with a giant electro-optic\ncoefficient would have profound implications for non-linear optics, especially at the single photon\nlevel, enabling single photon entanglement and switching. Here we propose and demonstrate a giant\nelectro-optic effect based on polarizable dark states. We demonstrate phase modulation of the light\nfield in the dark state medium and measure an electro-optic coefficient that is more than 12 orders\nof magnitude larger than in other gases. This enormous Kerr non-linearity also creates the potential\nfor precision electrometry and photon entanglement.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.-a, 32.80.Rm, 42.50.Gy\nIn 1875 Kerr showed that the refractive index (nr) of a\nmedium can be changed by applying an electric field [1]\naccording to\n\u2206nr = \u03bb0B0E20 ,\nwhere \u03bb0 is the wavelength of the light field, E0 is the\napplied electric field and B0 is the electro\u2013optic Kerr\ncoefficient. Subsequently, the Kerr effect, or quadratic\nelectro\u2013optic effect, and the related linear electro\u2013optic\neffect have become widely used in photonic devices such\nas electro-optic modulators (EOMs) [2, 3]. The ac Kerr\neffect where the electric field is produced by another light\nbeam is the basis of Kerr lens mode\u2013locking [4], and has\nled to the development of femto and attosecond pulses [5].\nOutside these successes, the wider applicability of the\nKerr effect is limited by the fact that, in general, the\nKerr non\u2013linearity is very small. A larger non\u2013linearity\noccurs close to a resonance, but at the expense of higher\nabsorption of the signal light. A way around this prob-\nlem is to use electromagnetically induced transparency\n(EIT) [6, 7, 8] where an additional light field, the cou-\npling beam, renders a medium transparent on resonance.\nEnhanced ac Kerr non\u2013linearities were predicted [9], and\nhave been studied in experiments on Bose Einstein con-\ndensates [10] and cold atoms [11]. However, such an EIT\nmedium produces insufficient non\u2013linearity to implement\nsingle photon non-linear optics [8]. In addition, the po-\ntential to implement all\u2013optical quantum computation\nusing the ac Kerr effect [12] is limited by pulse distortion\neffects [13], so a new Kerr mechanism based on interac-\ntions [14] is desirable.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate a giant dc electro-optic\neffect in an EIT medium by coupling to a highly excited\nRydberg state which has a large polarizability. This ren-\nders the transmission through the medium highly sen-\nsitive to electric fields produced either externally or in-\nternally due to interparticle interactions. The Rydberg\nstates have a polarizability that scales as the principal\nquantum number, n7, and the interactions between Ry-\ndberg atoms scale with an even higher power (n11 for\nvan der Waals interactions) [15]. These strong interac-\ntions lead to strongly correlated quantum states [16] and\ncould be used to entangle atoms [17] or photons [14].\nNon-linear effects due to strong interactions have been\nobserved in a number of experiments on cold Rydberg\natoms [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In our experiment, we show\nthat the special properties of Rydberg atoms lead to a\ngiant electro-optic effect (> 10\u22126 m\/V2), which is 12 or-\nders of magnitude larger than in other gases [23] and 6\norders of magnitude larger than the Kerr cell based on\nNitrobenzene [24]. This giant Kerr non-linearity opens\nup the possibility to devise a new class of single particle\ndetectors, precision measurements in electrometry, and\nsingle photon entanglement.\nRecently, EIT involving a Rydberg level has been ob-\nserved in thermal rubidium vapor [25] and a strontium\natomic beam [26]. In this experiment, we employ Ryd-\nberg EIT to measure the electro-optic effect in rubidium\nvapor. A signal beam propagating through the rubidium\nvapor is resonant with the 5s-5p transition, see Fig. 1(a).\nA counter-propagating coupling beam resonant with a\nRydberg transition, 5p-ns (with n = 28\u2212 48), drives the\nmedium into a polarizable dark state [25]. For such a\nthree level system, the absorption and the refractive in-\ndex calculated for atoms at rest are shown in Fig. 1(b).\nWhen both the signal and coupling beams are exactly on\nresonance, the medium is prepared in a dark state corre-\nsponding to a superposition of the ground and Rydberg\nstates [25]. In this dark state, the medium is transparent\nto the signal beam. If the energy of the Rydberg state is\nchanged, this modifies the absorption and the refractive\nindex (or dispersion) as indicated by the arrows in Fig.\n1(b). The energy of the Rydberg state is highly sensitive\nto electric field due to its large polarizability as illustrated\nin Fig. 1(a). Thus, the refractive index of the dark state\nmedium and hence, the phase of the signal beam, can be\nchanged by applying an electric field. This induced phase\nmodulation under the application of an ac electric field\nis measured using the set up shown in Fig 1(c). A weak\nlaser beam (red) at 780.24 nm, frequency stabilized [27]\nto the s 2S1\/2(F = 3) \u2192 5p 2P3\/2(F \u2032 = 4) transition of\n85Rb, is split into two paths (signal and reference) that\nar\nX\niv\n:0\n80\n4.\n32\n73\nv2\n  [\nqu\nan\nt-p\nh]\n  1\n9 A\nug\n 20\n08\n22.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-40 -20 0 20 40\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n \n \n!\nT\n (\n1\n0\n- 2\n)\n \n!\nn\n (\n1\n0\n- 7\n)\nDetuning (MHz)\n+ V\n- V\nCoupling\n(a) (c)\nSignal\n!1 0 1\n!2\n0\n2\nProbe detuning (!\n2\n)\nR\ne\n(\"\n2\n1\n),\n I\nm\n(\"\n 2\n1\n)\n0\n2\n4\n!0.05 0 0.05\n(b) (d)\nSignal detuning Coupling detuning (MHz)\n0 20 40-20-40\nn\n -\n 1\n (\n1\n0\n-7\n)\n0.0\nR\ne\nfr\na\nc\nti\nv\ne\n \nin\nd\ne\nx\n0.2\n-0.2\nT\n (\n1\n0\n-2\n)\n\u2206A\nb\ns\no\nrp\nti\no\nn\n1.0\n2.0\n0.0\nReference\nEnergy\nE - field\n5s\n5p\nns\nSignal\nCoupling\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic of the energy level diagram for Rydberg\nEIT.

(b)\nThe absorption and refractive index of the EIT medium as a\nfunction of the signal beam detuning. The images on the right\nshow an expanded view of this transparency window.

(d) The measured transmission and refractive\nindex of the signal beam for room temperature atoms as the\ncoupling beam is tuned through resonance with the Rydberg\ntransition.\npropagate through a vapor cell. The signal and reference\nbeams have the waist of 1 mm (1\/e2 radius) and power of\n15 \u00b5W. The counter propagating coupling beam at 480\nnm (derived from a commercial frequency doubled diode\nlaser system, Toptica TA-SHG) is overlapped with the\nsignal beam. The 480 nm beam has a power of 140 mW\nwith a waist of 0.8 mm (1\/e2 radius) and is frequency\nstabilized to the 5p 2P3\/2(F \u2032 = 4)\u2192 ns 2S1\/2(F \u2032\u2032) tran-\nsition (the ns state hyperfine splitting is not resolved)\nusing the Rydberg EIT resonance [25]. The signal and\nthe reference beams are recombined using a second beam\nsplitter, forming the Jamin interferometer that measures\nthe relative phase. By blocking the reference beam, one\ncan measure the transmission of the signal beam. The\nRb vapor cell was placed inside a single layer magnetic\nshield and between two copper bar electrodes which were\nused to apply the electric field. Fig. 1(d) shows a typi-\ncal measurement of the changes in the transmission and\nrefractive index experienced by the signal beam as the\ncoupling beam is tuned through the dark resonance for\natoms at room temperature. As the signal and coupling\nbeams are counter\u2013propagating, there is a partial cance-\nlation of the Doppler effect leading to a dark resonance\nline width of between 2 and 10 MHz depending on the\nlaser power [25].\nFig. 2 shows the response when the electric field is var-\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3\n1.72\n1.74\n1.76\n1.78 (c)\n(a)\nTime (msec)\nP\nh\na\ns\ne\n (\nra\nd\n)\n-2\n0\n2 (b)\n!\nT\n (\n1\n0\n-2\n)\n  \n-2\n0\n2\nE\n (\nV\n\/c\nm\n)\n  \n0 20 40 60 80\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\nP\no\nw\ne\nr \ns\np\ne\nc\ntr\nu\nm\n (\na\nrb\n. \nu\nn\nit\ns\n)\nFrequency (kHz)\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nTransmission\n2nd 4th\nPhase\n6th\n(e)\n(d)\n( )\n( )\n( )\n0. 0.\nTime (ms)\n0. 0.3\n0\n2\n-\n0\n0.06\n0.06\n0.06\n0\n-2\nFIG. 2: The time dependence of (a) the applied electric field,\nE, (b) the change in transmission through the medium, \u2206T\nand (c) the phase of the signal beam for a room temperature\nRb vapor cell.

With the reference beam blocked,\nwe observe a modulation of the transmission with am-\nplitude of about 1 %, see Fig. 2(b). By unblocking the\nreference beam we observe the phase modulation of ap-\nproximately 7 mrad, see Fig. 2(c). The frequency spec-\ntrum of the amplitude and phase modulations are shown\nin Fig. 2(d) and (e). With the signal and coupling lasers\nlocked just below the EIT resonance, the modulation in\nthe transmission and the phase appear predominantly at\nthe fourth and second harmonics of the modulation fre-\nquency, respectively. The Stark shift is proportional to\nE2, so the refractive index (in the region of linear dis-\npersion) is also proportional to E2. This E2 dependence\nis characteristic of the Kerr effect [2]. The transmission\nis modulated around the peak of the resonance and so\nis proportional to the energy shift squared and conse-\nquently to E4, as observed. If the amplitude of the elec-\ntric field is sufficiently large that the Stark shift is greater\nthan the width of the dark resonance then the amplitude\nand phase modulation no longer have a simple power law\ndependence and higher harmonics are observed.\nThe magnitude of the phase shift in a room tempera-\nture cell as a function of the applied electric field (E0)\nis shown in Fig. 3(a). The electric field dependence of\nthe phase shift (\u2206\u03c6) follows the shape of the dispersion\ncurve above resonance. By assuming the EIT resonance\nhas a Lorentzian profile, the phase shift has the form,\n\u2206\u03a6 = aE20\/(1 + bE\n4\n0). The free parameters, a and b are\ndetermined from the fit and give the maximum phase\nshift. This allows one to calculate the wavelength inde-\npendent Kerr coefficient, B0 using\n\u2206\u03c6 = 2piB0`|E0m|2 ,\nwhere ` = 0.075 m is the length of the medium, and E0m\nis the electric field at which the maximum phase shift\nis observed.

(b)\nMeasured Kerr constant in a vapor cell at 20\u25e6 C (\u2022) and 60\u25e6 C\n(\u25e6) as a function of the reduced principal quantum number,\nn\u2217. The solid line corresponds to a scaling of n\u2217\u03b1, where\n\u03b1 = 5.2\u00b1 0.2.\npresented in Fig 3. The experimental data show an n\u22175.2\npower law scaling, where n\u2217 = n\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u2248 3.13 is the\nquantum defect of the s Rydberg series [28]. The Kerr\ncoefficient depends linearly on the change in refractive\nindex of the medium. In the region of linear dispersion,\nthis change is proportional to the product of the Stark\nshift and the slope of the dispersion feature. The Stark\nshift of the Rydberg state scales as n\u22177. The slope of\nthe dispersion signal is proportional to its amplitude and\ninversely proportional to its width. The amplitude has a\nquadratic dependence on the Rabi frequency of the 5p-ns\ntransition and scales as n\u2217\u22123. The width is power broad-\nened in our experiment and reduces with higher n\u2217. This\nwidth scaling varies between n\u2217\u22121 and n\u2217\u22123\/2 depend-\ning on the signal and coupling beam intensities. The\nobserved power law dependence of the Kerr coefficient,\nn\u22175.2, is consistent with these scalings.\nThe maximum measured Kerr coefficient at room tem-\nperature is of order 10\u22126 m\/V2 which is already much\nlarger than in other media. By heating the cell to 600C,\nthe Kerr coefficient increases by two orders of magnitude\nas shown in Fig. 3(b). Much larger Kerr coefficients are\npossible using a dense cloud of laser cooled atoms. For\nexample, for a cold atom ensemble with diameter 10 mi-\ncrons at a density of 2\u00d7 1012 cm\u22123 and an n = 60 dark\nstate, one obtains a phase shift of 2pi for a field of 3 V\/m,\ncorresponding to a Kerr coefficient of order 104 m\/V2. In\nthis high density regime it is necessary to avoid interac-\ntion effects [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] by using a weak signal\nbeam.\nA primary application of the electro-optic effect is the\ngeneration of light at a different frequency [2, 3]. For\nexample, light propagating through a non-linear medium\nsubject to an ac electric field acquires sidebands at har-\nmonics of the modulation frequency. This sideband gen-\neration is easily observed using polarizable dark states.\nTo measure the sidebands, we perform a heterodyne mea-\nsurement on the signal beam. The reference beam of the\nJamin interferometer shown in Fig 1(c) was blocked and\nthe signal beam was interfered with another reference\nbeam derived from the same laser but frequency shifted\nby 400 MHz using an acousto-optic modulator. This 2nd\nreference beam has a waist of 1 mm and power of 1 mW.\nThe beat signal was detected using a fast photo-diode\nwith a bandwidth of 1.2 GHz. The power spectrum of\nthe beat signal was recorded using a spectrum analyzer.\nTypical spectra are shown in Fig. 4. With the cou-\npling laser turned off, we observe a single beat frequency.\nWhen the coupling laser is turned on, sidebands appear.\nThe dominant sideband is the 2nd order as expected for\nthe Kerr effect. The first harmonic sidebands can be ob-\nserved by applying a DC field along with the modulating\nfield. These data are recorded at a cell temperature of 60\u25e6\nC, where the atomic density and hence the phase modu-\nlation are significantly larger than at room temperature\nas shown in Fig. 3(b). With the signal and coupling\nlasers tuned to the 5s-5p-32s dark resonance, we observe\nsidebands with an intensity of \u223c 1% of the carrier for an\napplied voltage of 3 V\/cm. The sideband intensity is 60\ntimes larger than at room temperature, whereas the EIT\npeak height only increases by a factor of 2. This shows\nthat the observed sidebands are predominantly due to\nphase modulation.\nThe sideband amplitude as a function of modulation\nfrequency, i.e., the modulation bandwidth (see inset of\nFig. 4) is determined by the transient response of the\nEIT (dark state) resonance. If the coupling Rabi fre-\nquency is less than the decay rate of the intermediate\nstate, \u03b3, then the characteristic EIT response time is \u03b3\n[29, 30]. Consequently for Rb atoms where the intermedi-\nate state lifetime is \u03c4 \u223c 1\/(2pi\u00d76 MHz) one would expect\na modulation bandwidth equal to the natural linewidth\nof 6 MHz. The Lorentzian fit to the experimental data\nshown in the inset of the Fig. (4), has a full width half\nmaximum of 10 MHz. This value agrees with the res-\nonance width obtained using Doppler free spectroscopy,\nand is slightly larger than the natural width due to pres-\nsure broadening from the background gas in the cell.\nAn interesting potential application of the giant\nelectro-optic coefficient of polarizable dark states is pre-\ncision electrometry. Such a device would provide the\nelectric field analogue of precision atomic magnetometers\n[31]. As measuring electric fields in free space is chal-\nlenging, a dark state electrometer could find widespread\napplications in diverse areas such as geophysics and bio-\nphysics. For the predicted Kerr coefficient of a cold 10\nmicron ensemble, 104 m\/V2, a 1 mrad phase shift cor-\nresponds to a field of 400 \u00b5V\/cm. In this case, a single\ncharge at distance of 0.1 mm induces a phase shift of\n100 mrad. Hence the electrometer could provide efficient\ndetection of single charged particles. The advantage of\nusing dark states to measure electric fields is the high\n4-100\n-80\n-20 -10 0 10 20\n0\n1\n5\n-20 -10 0 10 20\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\nB\ne a\nt  s\ni g\nn a\nl  [\nd B\nm\n]\n\u03bd m [M\nHz\n]\n\u03bd - \u03bd0 [MHz]\n(x 10-2)\n \n \nP s\n( 2\n\u03bd m\n) \/ P\n0( \u03bd\n0)\n\u03bd - \u03bd0 [MHz]\nFIG. 4: The power spectrum of the light transmitted through\nthe dark state ensemble with the coupling laser turned off\nis shown in red, where \u03bd is the measurement frequency and\n\u03bd0 is the carrier frequency. The sidebands generated with\nthe coupling laser on and an electric field modulation with\nfrequency \u03bdm equal to 1 and 5 MHz are shown in green and\nblue, respectively. The inset shows a Lorentzian fit to the\npower of the 2nd harmonic sidebands normalized to the power\nof the carrier. The full width half maximum of the fit is 10\nMHz. The data were recorded in a Rb vapour cell at 600 C.\nbandwidth and ability to perform non-destructive mea-\nsurements with a high repetition rate. Polarizable dark\nstates can also be employed to detect single dipoles such\nas other Rydberg atoms which forms the basis of a pro-\nposed technique to entangle single photons in free space\n[14].\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a giant electro-\noptic effect in a gas based on polarizable dark states.\nThe measured Kerr coefficient for thermal Rb vapour at\nroom temperature, B0 \u223c 10\u22126 m\/V2 is many orders of\nmagnitude larger than in other electro\u2013optic media. We\nhave demonstrated phase modulation over a frequency\nrange of 10 kHz to 10 MHz, and observed sidebands gen-\neration with an intensity up to 1% of the carrier. A\nsignificantly larger electro-optic coefficient could be ob-\ntained by increasing the optical depth for example by\nusing laser cooled atoms. This giant electro-optic effect\nopens up the prospect of precision electrometry, single\nparticle detection, and single photon entanglement.\nWe are grateful to E. Riis, T. Pfau, M. P. A.
