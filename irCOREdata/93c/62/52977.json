Introduction \nThere is undoubtedly much global interest in advancing medical science and technology in the area of \nbiomaterials. Consequently, work to this end is often at the forefront of research in many disciplines, \nwith laser materials processing being no exception. Yet despite this, to date only an extremely limited \namount of work pertaining to the use of lasers for treating and processing biomaterials has been \npublished. To improve the corrosion characteristics of NiTi shape memory alloys (SMAs) in \nphysiological solutions, Villermaux et al [1] examined the possibility of treating the surface of the \nSMAs with excimer laser radiation. The study concluded that the corrosion resistance of the material \nwas increased due to homogenisation of the surface as a result of melting, surface hardening and the \nthickening of the surface oxide layer. Work by Guzzardella et al [2] found that low power diode laser \n(LPDL) treatment of implanted prosthetic bone devices fabricated from hydroxyapatite (HA) brought \nabout considerable enhancement in the bone-HA implant interface. Using CO2, Nd:YAG excimer and \nhigh power diode laser (HPDL) radiation Lawrence and Li found that it was possible to effect \nchanges in the wettability characteristics of the bio-polymers polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) [3] \nand polyethylene (PE) [4]. \nBut, if the laser is to open up entirely new technologies and unique application areas within the \nbiomaterials field then the fundamental differences in the beam absorption characteristics by \nmaterials that exist between different lasers must be investigated. This is particularly true for the \nrelatively contemporary HPDL. Such studies are necessary as the outcomes of many laser processing \nprocedures are inextricably influenced by this parameter. For direct surgical applications this \nimplication has been realised and consequently, many studies have been carried out to examine the \neffects of laser wavelength variation [5-11]. These studies have revealed clear differences in the \nperformance and effectiveness of many different lasers when interacting with various body parts. In \ncontrast, comparative investigations of the differences in the beam interaction characteristics of the \npredominant materials processing lasers, the CO2, the Nd:YAG and the excimer laser, are few in \nnumber [12-15]. Even fewer in number are practical comparisons between the established materials \nprocessing lasers and the recently arrived HPDL. Previously Schmidt et al [16] compared the \nperformance of CO2, excimer and HPDLs in the removal of chlorinated rubber coatings from \nconcrete surfaces and remarked on wavelength dependant differences in the process performance. \nAlso, Bradley et al [17] compared the CO2 and HPDL for the treatment of Al2O3-based refractory \nmaterials in terms of microstructure and observed wavelength dependant microstructural \n  4 \ncharacteristics unique to each laser. In more comprehensive investigations, Lawrence and Li \ncompared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and HPDL radiation on the wettability characteristics \nof ceramic [18], metallic [19, 20] and polymeric [3, 4] materials, noting that changes in the \nwettability characteristics of the material varied depending upon the laser type. Furthermore, \nLawrence et al carried out a comparative study of the characteristic of the glazes generated on the \nsurface of concrete with CO2 and HPDL\u2019s [21, 22], as well determining the absorption depths of CO2 \nand HPDL beams in ordinary Portland cement [23, 24] and an Al2O3-based refractory [25]. \nBy using a CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and a HPDL this paper aims to provide comparative information \non the absorption characteristics (in terms of laser wavelength variations) of a partially stabilised \nzirconia (PSZ) bio-ceramic through such attributes as absorption length and thermal loading. PSZ is a \nceramic that has found wide usage in medical and dental surgery. Within medicine it is commonly \nused to fabricate hip ball joints, whilst in dentistry it is used to manufacture dental implants, dental \nposts, brackets and inlays. Consequently, it is believed that this work will provide valuable insight \ninto some of the performance characteristics of the HPDL in comparison with the other more \ntraditional materials processing lasers for the treatment of biomaterials, in particular PSZ. \n2. Experimental procedures \nFour industrial lasers were used in this work: a CO2 laser (Rofin-Sinar, RS-3000), a Nd:YAG laser \n(Lumonix, JK704) a KrF excimer laser (Lambda Physik, 200mc) and a GaAlAs HPDL (Rofin-Sinar, \nDL 015). The general operating characteristics of the lasers used in the study are detailed in Table1. \nThe CO2 laser beam was delivered to the surface of the PSZ bio-ceramic samples by focusing the \nbeam through a 150 mm focal length ZnSe lens to give a stable diverging beam with beam diameters \nof 0.6-1.8 mm. The HPDL beam used ranged in size from 1.6- 2.1 mm in diameter and was delivered \nto the surface of the PSZ bio-ceramic samples by means of a 5 m long, 1.5 mm core diameter optical \nfibre, the end of which was connected to a 42 mm focal length lens assembly. The beams produced \nby both the CO2 laser and the HPDL were multi-mode. For the Nd:YAG laser, the beam was \ndelivered to the surface of the PSZ bio-ceramic samples by means of a 4 m long, 1 mm core diameter \noptical fibre. The beam, which was of a Gaussian profile, was then focused on to the surface of the \nPSZ bio-ceramic samples by means of a 120 mm focal length focusing lens assembly with diameters \nof 1.2-2.2 mm. In the case of the Nd:YAG and HPDLs the focussing optics assembly units were \nattached to the z-axis of a 3-axis computerised numerical control (CNC) gantry table, whilst the PSZ \n  5 \nbio-ceramic samples were placed on the x-axis. In the CO2 laser arrangement the focussing optics \nwere fixed and the PSZ bio-ceramic samples were placed on the x-axis of a CNC x-y table. In all \nthree instances the laser optics were protected by means of a coaxially blown Ar shield gas jet a rate \nof 5 l\/min. The excimer laser radiation was firstly passed directly through a circular aperture and then \na beam homogenizer. The beam was then focussed on the surface of the PSZ bio-ceramic samples to \na spot size of 0.5 x 0.5 mm\n2\n to 3.5 x 3.5 mm\n2\n. Here the PSZ bio-ceramic samples were attached using \ndouble-sided tape to the x-axis of a CNC x-y table. The whole arrangement was tipped vertically so \nas to be perpendicular the incident excimer laser beam. The excimer laser beam had a square top hat \nprofile and the processing took place in an air atmosphere. \nFor the purpose of experimental convenience the PSZ bio-ceramic was fabricated into blocks (25 x 25 \nx 5 mm) prior to laser treatment. The PSZ bio-ceramic was treated with all four lasers at room \ntemperature and in normal atmospheric conditions. Experiments were carried out in order to \ndetermine the minimum threshold fluence, the absorption length and to examine the thermal loading \ncharacteristics of the PSZ bio-ceramic. Here it was necessary that the fluences of all four lasers were \nset such that no melting occurred. The absence of melting and vitrification was verified by subjecting \nthe irradiated areas to an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to ensure the PSZ bio-ceramic retained its \ncrystallinity.  \n3. Results and discussion \nThe depth of material removed per pulse or shot, h, for organic polymer, inorganic insulating and \nsemi-conducting materials has been frequently described by a logarithmic law which follows, \nheuristically, from Beer-Lambert\u2019s law [26] \n \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n=\ntF\nF\nh ln\n1\n\u03b1\n (1) \nwhere \u03b1 is the optical absorption coefficient, F is the laser fluence and Ft is the threshold value of the \nfluence at which significant material removal occurs. Moreover, this expression has been shown to be \ncompletely applicable to other composite and ceramic materials [23-25]. It is important to realise that \nthe validity of (1) rests on the assumption that the plume species resulting from material removal \nabsorb the laser beams in a similar manner to the solid. Also, probable changes in the absorption level \nof the material as removal progresses are not taken in account by (1). Nonetheless, as the work of \n  6 \nAndrew et al [27], Schmidt et al [16] and Lawrence et al [23-25] demonstrated, this simple form of \nthe expression is quite adequate as a first approximation. Also, according to B\u00e4uerle [26] the \nexpression is applicable to ablation processes which are either photophysical or photochemical in \nnature. It is therefore acceptable to use the expression in instances such as this, where laser \nwavelengths, and consequently interaction mechanisms, vary considerably (from UV to IR).  \nThe relationship between h and F for the four laser beams incident with the PSZ bio-ceramic are \ngiven in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4. As one can see from these plots, h for the PSZ bio-ceramic irradiated with \nall four lasers was seen to display a logarithmic dependence on F. Further, by using an optical \nprofiling system (ProScan, Nanofinder) to determine the values of h for the various values of F, the \nminimum required threshold fluence for discernible material removal, Ft, was determined for each \nlaser (see Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4) and is given in Table 2. Although this approach has hitherto been \nemployed to examine pulsed lasers (excimer) and shown to be sound [27], the technique has also \nbeen used to investigate continuous wave (CW) lasers [16, 23-25]. What is more, the distinct linearity \nof the data points for the CO2 and HPDLs in Figs. 1 3 further validates the use of this approach for \nthe examination of CW lasers. It is important to note that this would assume a minimum conduction \nloss. However, the PSZ bio-ceramic has relatively low thermal conductivity of only 1.8 W\/mK [28], \nthus it is reasonable to assume that the laser power densities used were high enough and that the shots \nwere short enough to minimise the thermal conduction loss. \nNow, the term 1\/\u03b1 is the absorption length, so by rearranging (1) thus: \n \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n=\ntF\nF\nh\nln\n1\n\u03b1\n (2) \nthen it is possible to determine the length to which the beams of all four lasers are absorbed by the \nPSZ bio-ceramic. By introducing h and the corresponding value of F for each data point into (2) it \nwas possible to calculate the average absorption length for each laser under the actual experimental \nconditions (see Table 2). From a comparison of these absorption length values with the wavelengths \nat which each of the four laser emits given in Table 1, one can see that the absorption length appears \nto decrease with decreasing laser wavelength. It is worth remarking, however, that this decease is \ndisproportionate to actual laser wavelength.  \n  7 \nIt is interesting at this point to consider the actual absorptivity value of the surface of PSZ bio-\nceramic. Absorptivity measurements made at room temperature using a comparative technique \ndetailed elsewhere [29] revealed that the surface of the PSZ bio-ceramic absorbed around 68% of \nCO2 laser radiation, around 63% of the Nd:YAG laser radiation, around 59% of the HPDL radiation \nand around 53% of the excimer laser radiation. Now, for thick materials the sum of the absorptivity, \nA, and the reflectivity, R, is one. Accordingly A is related to R, which in turn depends upon the \n(complex) refractive index. These present results suggest that the real part of the index is dominant. \nSo, since these figures are of a similar order, it can be said that correlation between the actual \nabsorptivity of the PSZ bio-ceramic and the absorption length for each of the four lasers is not \nevident. Thus it is reasonable to assume that absorption length, rather than actual absorptivity, plays a \ngreater role in material coupling. \nWork Dyer et al [30, 31] has revealed that the surface energy density or thermal loading, \u03b3, of a \nmaterial increases in an almost linear manner until Ft is attained. Beyond this point \u03b3 becomes almost \nconstant due to the rapid ablation of products which carry away excess energy and consequently limit \nthe maximum temperature rise. The value of \u03b3 necessary to bring about removal is given by [31] \n \u03b1\u03b3 tF=  (3) \nFrom a rearrangement of (2) it is possible to calculate the value of the absorption coefficient, \u03b1, for \neach of the four lasers. So, by introducing the values of Ft for each of the four lasers deduced earlier \nfrom Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4, along with the values of \u03b1 for each laser into (3), then \u03b3 for the CO2 laser, the \nNd:YAG laser, the HPDL and the excimer laser were calculated (see Table 2). \n4. Conclusions \nThrough the utilisation of a derivative of Beer-Lambert\u2019s law, the laser beam absorption lengths of \nCO2 laser, Nd:YAG laser, HPDL and excimer laser radiation for a PSZ bio-ceramic were determined. \nThe absorption lengths, 1\/\u03b1, were calculated as 33.55 x 10-3 cm for the CO2 laser, 18.22 x 10-3 cm for \nthe Nd:YAG laser, 17.17 x 10\n-3\n cm for the HPDL and 8.41 x 10\n-6\n cm for the excimer laser. The \nfluence threshold values at which significant material removal occurs, Ft, for the CO2 laser, Nd:YAG \nlaser, HPDL and excimer laser were found to be 52 J\/cm2, 97 J\/cm2, 115 J\/cm\n2\n and 0.48 J\/cm\n2\n \nrespectively. The thermal loading, \u03b3, value for the CO2 laser, the Nd:YAG laser, the HPDL and the \n  8 \nexcimer laser were determined as 1.55 kJ\/cm\n3\n, 5.32 kJ\/cm\n3\n, 6.69 kJ\/cm\n3\n and 57.04 kJ\/cm\n3\n \nrespectively. Correlation between the actual absorptivity of the PSZ bio-ceramic and the absorption \nlength for each of the four lasers was not evident. Thus it is reasonable to assume that absorption \nlength, rather than actual absorptivity, plays a greater role in material coupling. \n  9 \nREFERENCES \n1. F. Villermaux, M. Tabrizian, L.H.
