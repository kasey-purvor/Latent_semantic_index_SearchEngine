INTRODUCTION\nIn 1952 Alan Turing proposed that a system of chemical\nsubstances, or morphogens, diffusing and reacting with each\nother, could produce spatially stable patterns \u00031\u0004. He intro-\nduced a system of reaction-diffusion equations and deter-\nmined general conditions for the formation of spatial patterns\ndriven by diffusion. For many years the existence of the\nTuring mechanism for morphogenesis in real biological sys-\ntems has been difficult to corroborate, although it seems that\nthere is now strong experimental evidence that pattern of\nfollicles on the skin of mice is produced by a Turing mecha-\nnism \u00032\u0004. Kondo and Asai \u00033\u0004 suggested that the pigment\npatterns on the skin of the angelfish Pomacanthus imperator\ncould be modeled by a Turing system, a notion further de-\nveloped by us \u00034,5\u0004. A further example of Turing systems in\npattern formation can be found in the generation of left-right\nasymmetry in the mouse embryo \u00036\u0004.\nAnother major issue has been that Turing models give\nvery simple patterns of spots or stripes, and more elaborate\nmodels are needed to mimic the patterns observed in many\nbiological systems. Coupled systems of reaction-diffusion\nequations have successfully been applied in the modeling of\na number of complex biological patterning events. From the\narrangement of omatidia in the Drosophila retina \u00037\u0004 to the\npatterns on sea shells \u00038\u0004 and the arrangement of tentacles\naround the primary organizer in hydra \u00039\u0004. It is this type of\nmodel that we discuss here.\nA. Linearly coupled Turing models\nA few years ago we proposed \u000310\u0004 that coupling two\nsimple Turing systems could produce more complex patterns\nand simulate reasonably well some complicated structures,\nincluding the skin patterns of some fish species. There we\nused linear, quadratic, and cubic couplings and found that\nlinear and cubic terms could modify the basic stripe or spot\npatterns substantially, contrary to quadratic coupling which\nhad very little effect on the basic patterns.\nMore recently, a series of papers investigate a way of\nlinearly coupling two sets of Turing equations, using the\nBrusselator model \u000311\u0004, the Oregonator model \u000312\u0004, or the\nLengyel-Epstein model \u000313\u0004. All these models preserve the\nstable fixed point in the absence of diffusion, and when the\nparameters ensure unstable resonating modes at two different\nwavelengths, beautiful patterns appear. Examples are the so-\ncalled \u201ceyes,\u201d spots contained in stripes or vice versa, or\npatterns with spots of two different sizes \u0001wavelengths\u0002.\nThese models can be interpreted as systems consisting of two\nchemically active layers, separated by an intermediate layer\nthat is not chemically active, but allows diffusion of chemi-\ncals through it. Experimental research has been carried out in\nthis particular field of multilayer systems to verify the model\n\u0001see \u000314\u0004\u0002.\nB. Nonlinearly coupled Turing models\nThere are also situations where the intermediate layer\ncould be chemically active, resulting in interlayer interac-\ntions that are more complicated than simple diffusion of\nchemicals. For example, they may involve reactions and\ncatalyzers. Turing systems coupled nonlinearly have been\nstudied by us recently \u000315\u0004. In this work, a cubic coupling\nwas introduced between the constituents such that the mor-\nphogen concentration and the original fixed points of the\nsystem are conserved. The resulting fourth order characteris-\ntic polynomial may facilitate two well-separated Turing*Corresponding author.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 79, 031908 \u00012009\u0002\n1539-3755\/2009\/79\u00013\u0002\/031908\u000111\u0002 \u00a92009 The American Physical Society031908-1\nspaces and hence give rise to two very different wavelengths\ncompeting in a complex manner.\nIn contrast to the case of linear coupling, our results\nshowed that the strength of coupling has a great impact on\nthe patterns produced. Strong coupling between the systems\nleads to very simple patterns\u2014a result of only one wave-\nlength surviving\u2014whereas weak coupling leads to complex\npatterns with symmetries that are not simply a resonant su-\nperposition of patterns with different wavelengths.\nC. Aims and outline\nThe skin of vertebrates is made up of layers, which may\ninteract by chemicals diffusing between them; as such, they\nare ideal systems to be modeled by coupling two sets of\nreaction-diffusion equations. In this paper we propose a\nsimple model that produces patterns very similar to those\nobserved in the skin of freshwater stingrays of the Amazon\nbasin. We use the general reaction-diffusion system of Ref.\n\u000310\u0004 to simulate the chemical reactions in two skin layers.\nThe kinetics are assumed to be the same in both layers and\ntherefore events in both layers are modeled using the same\nset of reaction-diffusion equations, but with different param-\neters in each layer. To allow the diffusion of chemicals be-\ntween layers one couples the two systems linearly. An im-\nportant assumption is that the dynamics in one of the layers\nmay become stationary after some time and serve as a source\nof morphogens for the second layer, modifying the pattern\nproduced by the latter.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present\nthe biological basis of the possible mechanisms that could\nproduce coloration of the skin and the patterns of the fish we\nare considering. In Sec. III we discuss the basic properties of\nour model system and through linear analysis we explore the\nvarious bifurcations that give rise to different patterns. In\nSec. IV we exhibit the resulting patterns from extensive nu-\nmerical simulations, and in Sec. V we discuss these results\nand draw some conclusions.\nII. BIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND\nVertebrate skin consists of two layers: an overlying der-\nmis separated from an epidermis by a basal lamina, see Fig.\n1 and Ref. \u000316\u0004. The dermis is made up of several sheets of\ncells, the outer sheets being formed via mitosis taking place\nin the inner sheets. The mesenchymal cells of the underlying\ndermis are able to migrate in the extracellular matrix to form\nstructures such as the hair follicles and feather buds. The\ndividing basal lamina tightly couples the two skin layers\nwhilst allowing signals to travel between them. The forma-\ntion of skin appendages and patterns requires the interaction\nof epithelium and mesenchyme \u000317\u0004. It has been demon-\nstrated that the mesenchyme determines the number, size,\nlocation, and structural identity of the appendage, while the\nepithelium determines the orientation \u000318\u0004.\nA mechanochemical framework has been suggested for\nmodeling the formation of skin appendages and patterns\n\u000319\u201322\u0004. In general these models use a system of partial dif-\nferential equations to describe the density of mesenchymal\ncells and extracellular matrix, with matrix deformations\nmodeled using a small-strain assumption. Events in the over-\nlying epidermis are modeled using a system of reaction-\ndiffusion equations to describe the distribution of various\nsignaling factors present. The two layers are coupled via in-\nteraction terms present in the systems. Such coupled systems\nare capable of producing more complex patterns than the\nsimple systems generally used to describe patterning, but\nthey can be difficult to study, analytically or numerically.\nCoupled systems of reaction-diffusion equations, however,\nmay also lead to the generation of complex patterns and are\nmore amenable to analytical and computational examination\n\u000310,15\u0004. Our assumption in this case will be, similar to any\nreaction-diffusion model, that the chemical pre-pattern in-\nduces a sorting of the different cell types and therefore leads\nto the observed patterns.\nStingray patterning\nOne specific application we consider will be to pigmenta-\ntion patterning in stingrays. Freshwater stingrays of the fam-\nily Potamotrygonidae, the only living family of Chondrich-\nthyes \u0001sharks, rays, and chimaeras\u0002 restricted to freshwater,\noccur in many South American river systems that flow into\nthe Atlantic Ocean or Caribbean Sea \u000323\u0004. Most potamotry-\ngonid species have highly intricate dorsal color patterns,\nwhich may include variously shaped spots, ocelli \u0001spots sur-\nrounded by rings\u0002, rosettes, reticular, and vermiform mark-\nings, or a combination of these, usually distributed over a\ngrey, brown, reddish-brown, or blackish background color.\nOf particular interest to us will be the complex patterns\nfound on the skin of the stingray Potamotrygon motoro,\nshown in Fig. 2, for three reasons: \u0001i\u0002 In potamotrygonid\nstingrays, as in chondrichthyans in general, major coloration\ncharacteristics are mostly established by birth or shortly\nthereafter. Furthermore, coloration does not vary drastically\nin response to local, external stimuli, as is possible in other\ngroups of fishes. \u0001ii\u0002 The pattern does not look like a simple\nTuring pattern. \u0001iii\u0002 The pattern differs between species and\nmay also depend on the gender and age of the fish. We aim to\nshow that this polymorphism could be explained by the same\nmodel.\nFIG. 1. Illustration of the different skin layers. The outer layer\n\u0001epidermis\u0002 consists of columnar epithelial cells arranged in sheets,\nwhilst the inner layer \u0001dermis\u0002 consists of mesenchymal cells that\nare more loosely arranged and able to migrate on the extracellular\nmatrix.\nBARRIO et al.

ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMICAL MODEL\nIn Ref. \u000310\u0004 we proposed a reaction-diffusion model with\ntwo chemicals, u and v, obtained by assuming a fixed point\nat \u0001u ,v\u0002= \u00010,0\u0002 and Taylor expanding the nonlinear kinetics\nof the model around this point, up to cubic terms. We shall\ncall it the BVAM model from now on. It can be written in\nnondimensional form as\n\u0001u\n\u0001t\n= D\u00022u + \u0002\u0001u + av \u2212 Cuv \u2212 uv2\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\n\u0001v\n\u0001t\n= \u00022v + \u0002\u0001bv + hu + Cuv + uv2\u0002 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere D=Du \/Dv is the ratio of diffusion constants, \u0002 gives\nthe spatiotemporal scale, and C measures the relative\nstrength of the quadratic and cubic terms.\nThe model has three fixed points located at \u0001u0 ,v0\u0002\n= \u00010,0\u0002 and \u0001u0 ,v0\u0002\u0003=v\u0003\u0001\u2212g ,1\u0002, where\nv\u0003 =\n\u2212 C\u0003 \u0005C2 \u2212 4\u0001h \u2212 b\/g\u0002\n2\n, \u00013\u0002\nand\ng = \u0001a + b\u0002\/\u00011 + h\u0002 . \u00014\u0002\nIn general, the Jacobian matrix takes the form\nJ = \u00061 \u2212 \u0004 a \u2212 \u0005h + \u0004 b + \u0005 \u0007 , \u00015\u0002\nwhere\n\u0004 = v0\u0001C + v0\u0002 , \u00016\u0002\nand\n\u0005 = Cu0 + 2u0v0 = \u2212 gv0\u0001C + 2v0\u0002 . \u00017\u0002\nThe diffusion matrix is\nD = \u0006D\/\u0002 00 1\/\u0002 \u0007 . \u00018\u0002\nIn the linearized system a dispersion relation is found by\nsolving the characteristic equation \bA\u2212\u0006I\b=0, where I is the\nunit matrix and A=J\u2212D\u00072. One obtains\n\u00062\u0001\u00072\u0002 \u2212 \u0006\u0001\u00072\u0002Tr\u0001A\u0002 + Det\u0001A\u0002 = 0. \u00019\u0002\nThis model has only one stationary state \u0001at u0=v0=0\u0002\nwhen h=\u22121. A complete analysis of this situation, including\na nonlinear analysis of the amplitude equations, has been\npublished elsewhere \u000324\u0004.\nThe existence of the other fixed points makes this model\nvery rich in behavior. For instance, if one fixes the value of h\nin the absence of diffusion \u0001k=0\u0002, the complex eigenvalues\n\u0001w=\b+ i\t\u0002 can be examined in the plane \u0001g , f\u0002, where f\n=b \/g\u2212h. If Det\u0001J\u0002=0 one of the roots is \u0006=0 and the other\nis real \u0001observe that h\u0003\u22121\u21d2g=0\u0002. The condition Tr\u0001J\u0002=0\nmarks the region where \b changes sign. The discriminant\ncondition Tr\u0001J2\u0002\u22124 Det\u0001J\u0002=0 separates the regions of real\nand complex roots. These three conditions divide the \u0001g , f\u0002\nspace into the five regions shown in Fig. 3.\nIn region 1 there are saddle points, therefore trajectories\nthat start in the general vicinity of the fixed points first ap-\nproach them, and then diverge. As a result of the cubic reac-\ntion terms, there is a stable limit cycle that encompasses the\ntwo fixed points. The existence of this limit cycle was cor-\nroborated by numerical simulation. In region 5 the fixed\npoints are unstable; trajectories that start in their vicinity\ndiverge in an oscillatory manner. There is also a limit cycle\nin this region. In region 2 both roots have negative real part,\nbut with an oscillatory contribution. In region 3 there is the\npossibility of an instability driven by diffusion, producing\nstationary spatial Turing patterns. A detailed analysis of the\nmodel under these conditions is published elsewhere \u000325\u0004.

These structures have been studied in\ndetail by Gomila et al. \u000326\u0004, examining the evolution of do-\nmain walls in nonlinear optical systems with a complex\nGinzburg-Landau model. In general one can show that if a\nsystem has two different stable steady states, which are\nequivalent under the existing symmetries, then there are\nwave fronts that connect the two steady states. In a one-\ndimensional domain they move with a velocity that depends\non the shape of the profile. In two dimensions the velocity\nalso depends on the local curvature.\nThese phenomena have been verified to occur in our\nreaction-diffusion model \u000325\u0004 at the border between region 2\nand region 5 \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002 in the absence of quadratic terms\nC=0, which produces two symmetrical fixed points around\nzero. If C\u00030 the fixed points become asymmetric, and the\nborder between regions 2 and 5 is different for each point\n\u0001u0 ,v0\u0002\u0003. Therefore one phase will dominate over the other\nand circular spot patterns of one steady state solution appear\nembedded in the other steady state. It is these predicted sta-\ntionary dots that can be seen in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002.\nIt has been shown that if certain symmetry requirements\nare fulfilled by the Ginzburg-Landau model the radius of the\ncircular spot patterns can be calculated analytically \u000327\u0004. The\namplitude equations for the BVAM model when h=\u22121 can\nbe written as a complex Ginzbug-Landau system \u000328\u0004, and it\nis not surprising that these robust, isolated, circular excita-\ntions appear in the BVAM model. When h\u0003\u22121 and C\u00030\nthe system loses the symmetries that allow analytical treat-\nment of the bifurcation of Ref. \u000327\u0004, although it is still pos-\nsible to examine this peculiar bifurcation by generalizing the\nmethod, and this work is currently in progress.\nThe transition from moving front waves through labyrin-\nthine stationary patterns to disordered circular spot patterns\nof fixed radius when varying the value of the bifurcation\nparameter C was studied numerically, and it is shown in Fig.\n5. The critical value of C lies between 0.71 and 0.72.\nAll the patterns shown are stationary, except that shown in\nFig. 5\u0001a\u0002 in which the fronts move, continuously changing\nshape. This phenomenon arises since the velocity is propor-\ntional to the local curvature of the profiles, and as a conse-\nquence the points at which the curvature changes sign do not\nmove, giving an impression that the fronts rotate around\nthose points. Observe that the transition between stripes and\nspots is not sharp, and that one could have a combination of\nstripes and spots.\nExamples of such patterns in nature\nPatterns like these are found in many real systems, for\ninstance the skin pattern of freshwater catfish shown in Fig. 6\nvaries from a purely striped pattern to a disordered pattern of\ndots and stripes, very similar to the ones obtained in our\ncalculations.\nIV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nWe shall investigate numerically the case of a two-layered\nsystem that is coupled linearly.

Our aim is to obtain an irregular\npattern of big spots surrounded by a labyrinthine pattern as a\nbackground, as in Fig. 2. Specifically, in each layer we shall\nmodel events using the BVAM system but with the param-\neters in layer 1 lying in a different region of parameter space\nthan those in layer 2.\nA. Two separate systems\nSystem 1 consists of the BVAM model of Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002\ntuned with appropriate parameters to produce Turing patterns\n\u0001see the Appendix for more detail\u0002. Linear analysis around\nthe only fixed point \u00010, 0\u0002 reveals that with these parameters\nthe complex eigenvalues \u00061,2=\b1,2+ i\t have negative \b and\n\t=0 in the absence of diffusion. However, in the presence of\ndiffusion, the fixed point becomes linearly unstable \u0001\b\u000b0\nand \t=0\u0002 to certain admissible modes around \u0007c\t0.65. This\nis known as a diffusion-driven or Turing instability. The re-\ngion of parameter space wherein the conditions of a Turing\ninstability \u000310\u0004 are met is quite small for the BVAM model\n\u0001see, for instance, Ref. \u000324\u0004\u0002. In two dimensions it is seen\nthat a cubic nonlinearity favors stripes, and the quadratic one\nproduces robust spots \u000329\u0004. This model produces simple Tur-\ning patterns of stripes \u0001C=0\u0002 or spots \u0001C\u00030\u0002.\nExamples of numerical calculations are given in Fig. 7 for\ndifferent boundary conditions. The gray scale represents the\nconcentration of morphogen u. In all the numerical simula-\ntions presented here we have used a simple Euler method to\nintegrate the dynamical equations, usually starting with a\nsmall random perturbation around zero as the initial condi-\ntion. The time step has to be small enough to converge reli-\nably \u000330\u0004, consequently we have used dt\t10\u22122.\nSystem 2 also consists of the BVAM model of Eqs. \u00011\u0002\nand \u00012\u0002 but it is set up in such a way that the fixed point \u00010,0\u0002\nis unstable and the other two fixed points are stable in zero\ndimensions \u0001\u0007=0\u0002, but the symmetry of the two stable points\nis lost by setting C=0.72.

Both layers obey\nthe kinetics Kui and Kvi given in Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002, but with\ndifferent parameter values. The parameters qu and qv are the\ncoupling strengths and represent diffusion between the two\nlayers.\nLinear analysis can be carried out in the usual way. There\nis only one fixed point at the origin for the coupled system,\nnamely ui=vi=0, i , j=1,2. If the coupling parameters qu and\nqv are small, the dispersion relation for the coupled system\nshows that a Turing instability is still possible. However,\nwhen the coupling increases the modes near \u0007=0 that are\nlinearly stable when the systems are uncoupled, can become\nunstable and oscillate, and Turing patterns are not possible.\nIn Fig. 9 we show a series of snapshots of numerical\ncalculations \u0001taken at regular time intervals\u0002, of a coupled\nsystem with qu=qv=0.0078, which is the critical value for\nthe Turing instability. We only show the dominant pattern of\nu2 because v2 is in antiphase, and because system 1 produces\na fairly normal Turing pattern, as can be seen in Fig. 9\u0001i\u0002,\nwhere the converged pattern of u1 is shown. The parameter\nvalues used are detailed in the Appendix, Sec. 2.\nObserve that the wave fronts initially moving through the\ndomain \u0001periodic boundary conditions were used\u0002 become\nimmobilized when the domains of high concentration \u0001dark\nregions\u0002 are approximately circular. Also notice that some of\nthe spots split during the process. The final pattern is a ran-\ndom disposition of large dots, with an average distance be-\ntween them much larger than the mean radius of the spots.\nThe Turing pattern of u1 is realized everywhere, but in the\nregions where there are spots the contrast is smaller, meaning\nthat the system is closer to the bifurcation and patterns there\nform more slowly and with smaller amplitude. It is also no-\nticeable that the size of the domains of high concentration of\nu2 \u0003around the value of v+ in Eq. \u00013\u0002\u0004 is fairly constant\nthroughout the domain.\nThe large spots are very peculiar, they are more similar to\nthe so-called \u201ceyes,\u201d since the shape of the wave front has a\nsharp asymmetric crest on the edges \u000325\u0004. In Fig. 10 we show\nthe profile of one spot taken from a cross section of the\nsolution for u2 shown in Fig. 9.\nAbove the critical coupling strength no Turing pattern is\nformed, yet the spots of system 2 acquire a different profile,\nwith oscillations at their borders caused by the coupling. An\nexample of a strongly coupled system is given in Fig. 11.\nObserve that the pattern of u1 is dictated by the shape of the\npattern from system 2. Only at the borders between the re-\ngions of high and low concentration \u0001when u2 and v2 are near\nzero\u0002 does an instability appear giving rise to spatial oscilla-\ntions that interfere and decay with distance.\nFIG. 8.

Patterns observed in nature\nPatterns of the kind exhibited by a two-layer coupled sys-\ntem can be compared with the coloration of the female stin-\ngrays shown in Fig. 12. However, the coloration of the adult\nmale fish cannot be simulated with the two layers being ac-\ntive. The changes seen in the coloration of the male fish as it\nmatures suggest that at some stage in development the pig-\nmentation pattern in one layer of the skin becomes stationary.\nA way of modifying the patterns is to assume that the initial\npattern forms in system 2 very rapidly, and then that the\ndynamics become very slow on the time scale of patterning\nin system 1. This could simulate the biological scenario that\nthe cells of one of the skin layers become inactive after the\nanimal has matured sufficiently. If this is so, the other layer\ncould accommodate to the new situation\u2014the inactive layer\nwill be sensed only as a background source of morphogen on\nwhich the Turing pattern evolves.\nD. System with a source\nThe hypothesis put forward for male stingray patterning\ncan be tested by simulating the dynamics of system 1 whilst\nadding a constant term proportional to the final stationary\npattern, u2\u0001x ,y\u0002, from system 2. This will provide a compli-\ncated parameter landscape in which the pattern will evolve.\nSpecifically, the dynamics of system 1 after system 2 has\nbecome stationary can be followed by\n\u0001u1\n\u0001t\n=\nD1\n\u00021\n\u00022u1 + Ku1\u0001u1,v1\u0002 + qu2, \u000112\u0002\n\u0001v1\n\u0001t\n=\n1\n\u00021\n\u00022v1 + Kv1\u0001u1,v1\u0002 , \u000113\u0002\nwhere the notation is the same as in Eqs. \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002.\nLinear stability analysis is now difficult: the elements of\nthe Jacobian matrix have a space dependence because the\nsteady states are spatially dependent due to the u2\u0001x ,y\u0002 term.\nHowever, as the profile u2 is nearly constant everywhere and\nonly varies rapidly at the edge of the circles \u0001see profile in\nFig. 10\u0002, one can apply an approximate method described\nelsewhere \u000331\u0004 when a parameter changes abruptly to predict\nthe regions where a Turing pattern can emerge. In Fig. 13 we\nshow the pattern used as a source, and the results of such a\nstudy.\nExtensive numerical simulations were carried out guided\nby this analysis. We discovered that the appearance of Turing\npatterns is not very sensitive to the strength of the coupling,\nq, contrary to the case in Sec. IV B when both systems are\nactive.\nThe patterns vary in appearance when one changes the\nstrength of the quadratic terms \u0001C1\u0002 in a way that resembles\nthe transition from young to adult male. In Fig. 14 we show\ntwo patterns that arise from a system with a source using the\nsame initial conditions for both. Figure 14\u0001a\u0002 for u1 and Fig.\n14\u0001b\u0002 for v1 correspond to C1=0.0. This resembles the pat-\ntern of the male stingray. Observe that although there are no\nquadratic nonlinearities, one obtains a dotted pattern instead\nof the expected Turing stripes. This is due to the interference\nof stripes in the complicated domain where the Turing insta-\nbility exists. Figure 14\u0001c\u0002 is obtained with C1=1.0 and this\nresembles the skin of the young fish, with a mixture of spots\nand stripes around the large spots. Observe that the pattern\nfor v1 in Fig. 14\u0001d\u0002 is in antiphase with u1, and also with v1\nin \u0001b\u0002. One could conclude that the different patterns the\nmale fish exhibit are due to a degradation of some chemical\nreaction in the adult fish.\nOther variations in the coloration of the stingrays can be\nsimulated by coupling the system to a u2 that is not fully\nconverged. This could mean that the reaction in one of the\nskin layers stops at an earlier stage.\nFIG. 11. \u0001Color online\u0002 Pattern of u1 obtained with the two-layer\ncoupled system given by Eqs. \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002 using qu=qv=0.2 and\nother parameter values as given in the Appendix, Sec. 2.

Notice that the Turing pattern of system 1 now\nappears almost everywhere in the domain. In the same figure\nwe show the time history of a single point \u0001at the center of\nthe domain\u0002 to reveal the way in which the dynamical system\nconverges numerically. Notice that after a relatively small\nnumber of time steps the oscillatory convergence has at-\ntained values such that \bu\u0001t+\rt\u0002\u2212u\u0001t\u0002 \b\n10\u22128.\nSimilar patterns could be obtained by diminishing the\nvalue of the coupling parameter q, since then one has effec-\ntively lowered the amplitude of the perturbation for system\n1. In Fig. 16 we show the changes of the pattern of u1 when\none varies the coupling parameter from q=0.0 to q=0.25.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have investigated pattern formation in a\ntwo-layer system in which patterning in one layer occurs on\na faster time scale and serves as the driver for patterning in\nthe layer of interest. The notion that patterns evolve from one\nstate to another instead of emerging de novo was in fact\nrecognized by Turing in his seminal 1952 paper \u00031\u0004. Since\nthen, a number of such studies have been proposed for pat-\nterning in the context of skin organ formation which build on\nthis. For example, Nagorka and Mooney \u000332\u0004 proposed a\nreaction-diffusion system for hair patterning in which high\nconcentrations of morphogen served to set up morphogen\nsources for subsequent patterning in the same system. This\nmodel was verified experimentally recently by Sick et al. \u00032\u0004.\nCruywagen et al. \u000333,34\u0004 proposed a coupled mecha-\nnochemical model for propagating patterns, while Painter et\nal. \u00035\u0004 coupled a chemotactic model with a Turing model to\ninvestigate complex patterning on growing domains. More\nrecently, Page et al. \u000331\u0004 showed how coupled reaction-\ndiffusion systems could lead to patterning outside the Turing\nregime.\nA detailed numerical investigation of two-layer systems\nwith different couplings has been carried out. These systems\ncan generate patterns not exhibited by the one-layer systems.\nThe novelty here is that the complexity of the underlying\n\u201cforcing\u201d system leads to quite new patterning phenomena\non the overlying system. The models used to represent each\nlayer need not be different, in fact most reaction-diffusion\nsystems exhibit a rich variety of bifurcations that can be\nused. In particular, the BVAM model examined here presents\nTuring, Hopf, and Turing-Hopf bifurcations when h\u0003\u22121.\nWe have also shown that stationary patterns can be obtained\nby other means. In particular, when the system becomes\nbistable it is possible to obtain circular wave fronts in a sta-\ntionary pattern that is extremely robust.\nFIG. 14. \u0001Color online\u0002 Patterns obtained from the system with\na source given by Eqs. \u000112\u0002 and \u000113\u0002, calculated with u2 as in Fig.\n13 and parameters as given in the Appendix, Sec. 3. \u0001a\u0002 u1 using\nC1=0.0, \u0001b\u0002 v1 using C1=0.0, \u0001c\u0002 u1 using C1=1.0, \u0001d\u0002 v1 using\nC1=1.0.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 79, 031908 \u00012009\u0002\n031908-8\nWe have reproduced the patterns seen in freshwater stin-\ngrays by tuning the parameters of the BVAM model to gen-\nerate disordered spots and using it as a source coupled to a\nTuring system. This suggests that only a simple mechanism\nis needed to produce the changes in coloration that may be\ngender and age dependent, since very straight-forward varia-\ntions in the concentration and diffusion of morphogens can\nproduce the observed changes. Coloration in freshwater\npotamotrygonid stingrays, as in fishes and lower vertebrates\nin general, is provided by the uppermost strata of the dermis\nthrough pigment-containing cells known as chromatophores\n\u000335,36\u0004. In our present study we have not included cells so\nwe must think of the chemical patterns we have shown above\nto be pre-patterns to which such cells would respond \u0001as in,\nfor example, Painter et al. \u00035\u0004\u0002.\nConspicuous differences in color and pattern of the skin\nare usually a guide for taxonomy, as in the case of freshwater\ncatfishes in the Amazon basin. However, we have shown that\ndiversity in coloration may be modeled by changing a single\nparameter in the same model, and that the patterns distin-\nguishing various species can be obtained. Therefore a more\ncomplete understanding of color pattern formation and varia-\ntion, both among and within species, as well as in relation to\nits ontogenetic development, is essential to properly interpret\nits systematic significance and usefulness in species identifi-\ncation. Whether species with similar color patterns are phy-\nlogenetically closely related requires the elucidation of their\nevolutionary history, for which molecular and morphological\napproaches are currently being implemented.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nR.A.B. is indebted to DGAPA \u0001UNAM\u0002 and CONACyT\nfor sabbatical grants, to CONACyT for Grant No. 79641, to\nthe Centre for Mathematical Biology, University of Oxford\nand LCE, Helsinki University of Technology for their hospi-\ntality.

In each case BC indicates the\nchoice of boundary conditions.\n2. Two-layer coupled system\nThe two-layer coupled system involves two BVAM sys-\ntems coupled together via terms proportional to the differ-\nence between u and v concentrations in each separate sys-\ntem, and can be written as follows:\n\u0001ui\n\u0001t\n=\nDi\n\u0002i\n\u00022ui + qu\u0001ui \u2212 uj\u0002 + Kui\u0001ui,vi\u0002 , \u0001A4\u0002\n\u0001vi\n\u0001t\n=\n1\n\u0002i\n\u00022vi + qv\u0001vi \u2212 v j\u0002 + Kvi\u0001ui,vi\u0002 , \u0001A5\u0002\nwhere the reactive species are distinguished by subscripts\ni=1,2 which denote the layer they are in. The kinetic terms,\nKui and Kvi, are as in the simple BVAM model:\nKui\u0001ui,vi\u0002 = ui + avi \u2212 Cuivi \u2212 uivi\n2\nand\nKvi\u0001ui,vi\u0002 = bvi + hui + Cuivi + uivi\n2\n. \u0001A6\u0002\nTable II shows parameter values used in Figs. 9 and 10.\nThe parameter values used in Fig. 11 are identical except that\nqu=qv=0.2.\n3. System with a source\nIn the system with a source, the simple BVAM model is\nsolved in layer 2:\n\u0001u2\n\u0001t\n= D\u00022u2 + \u0002\u0001u2 + av2 \u2212 Cu2v2 \u2212 u2v2\n2\u0002 , \u0001A7\u0002\n\u0001v2\n\u0001t\n= \u00022v2 + \u0002\u0001bv2 + hu2 + Cu2v2 + u2v2\n2\u0002 . \u0001A8\u0002\nIt is then used as a source for the BVAM system used in\nlayer 1. In general, for example in Fig. 14, system 2 is al-\nlowed to reach steady state so that u2\u0001x ,y , t\u0002\nu2\u0001x ,y\u0002 before\ncoupling to system 1:\n\u0001u1\n\u0001t\n=\nD1\n\u00021\n\u00022u1 + Ku1\u0001u1,v1\u0002 + qu2, \u0001A9\u0002\n\u0001v1\n\u0001t\n=\n1\n\u00021\n\u00022v1 + Kv1\u0001u1,v1\u0002 . \u0001A10\u0002\nThe parameter values used in Fig. 14 are detailed in Table\nIII. The same parameters are used in Fig. 15 except that\nC1=0.5 and q varies between 0.00 and 0.25.\n4.
