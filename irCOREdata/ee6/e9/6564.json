ISBN: 0-471-986240. Hardback, x+362\npages, \u00a334.95.\nFor many people, the terms 'multimedia' and\n'Internet' are now quite familiar expressions that\ntrigger many different thought patterns and\nassociations. Very often, the associations that we\nmake depend critically upon our backgrounds\nand prior experiences - particularly within\nhybrid areas such as multimedia, computing and\ninformation technology. Glossaries and\ndictionaries are therefore useful tools for\nproviding a common level of meaning for the\ntechnical terms and jargon that we use in\nparticular subject domains. This particular book\noffers a guide to the terminology associated with\nthe Internet and multimedia applications.\nFrancis Botto has had substantial experience as\na multimedia expert and, in compiling this\ndictionary, he has put together a valuable\ncollection of terms and their associated\n'definitions'. In some cases these are relatively\nshort and run to just a single line or two\n(for example, the entries for 'list box',\n'CONFIG.SYS' and 'cookie'). However, for\nmany entries (such as those for 'Lingo', 'MPEG\nvideo production' and 'ToolBook') the def-\ninitions take the form of extended 'essays' that\ntake up several pages. As well as providing\nexplanations and definitions of conventional\nartefacts, the dictionary also includes selected\nentries for prominent personalities and\ncompanies who are active within the multimedia\/\nInternet field. Jaron Lanier, for example, is\ndescribed as 'a VR specialist\/evangelist recog-\nnised as having invented the term virtual reality'\nwhile the entry for Bill Gates states that he is the\nworld's 'best known and financially most\nsuccessful computer software programmer and\nentrepreneur' - who can argue with that? The\ndictionary defines 'Quantum' as 'a company\nengaged in the manufacture of mass storage\ndevices' - incidentally, there is no entry for the\nterm 'quantum computing'.\nWhen evaluating a dictionary, glossary or\nencyclopedia, there are five important attributes\nthat need to be taken into account: its coverage\/\nscope; its completeness; the relevance of the\nterms included; the accuracy of the definitions it\ncontains; its consistency; and the overall quality\nof exposition. In my view this dictionary scores\nvery highly in each of these areas. However,\nhaving said this, and bearing in mind the above\ncriteria, I do have some very minor reservations\nabout the book. These stem from some of my\nconcerns about what the author has included,\nwhat he has excluded and how he has defined\ncertain terms. In several sections he has included\nseemingly irrelevant entries - for example, why\nhas the acronym for the American Association\nfor the Advancement of Sciences (AAAS) been\nincluded? There are also several cases of terms\nthat are poorly explained - such as XML,\nSGML and courseware (which is rather loosely\ndefined as 'a generic term for material used in\neducation\/training'). Finally, some examples of\n77\nReviews\nimportant excluded items include DTD, Hytime,\nBezier, style sheet, mobile computing, SMS and\nGSM. Interestingly, the author uses the acronym\nGSM in his introduction (page viii) but, as far as\nI am aware, never defines it - not even as a\ndictionary entry!\nDespite my minor reservations, I think this book\nprovides a very useful and valuable contribution\nto the growing volume of literature on\nmultimedia. The author has done a good job in\ncompiling the entries and, in most cases, lucidly\nexplaining them. I think many people will find\nthis dictionary an invaluable companion to have\nwith them while exploring the vast volume of\ntechnical literature that is now available on\ntopics relating to multimedia applications and\nthe Internet.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nJ. Calder and A. McCollum, Open and Flexible\nLearning in Vocational Education and Training,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN: 0-7494-2172-\nX. Paperback, xiv+160 pages, \u00a318.99.\nThe genesis of this book emerged from research\noriginally undertaken by Judith Calder and Ann\nMcColIum in 1994 for the Department for\nEducation and Employment. This explored the\nrelative effectiveness of traditional versus open\nand flexible learning routes. The authors now\nreturn to the scene, wielding a broader brush, to\nconsider 'the environment in which education\nand training strategy is determined and\ndelivered; the nature of the major stakeholders\nand of the needs being addressed; and the\nresulting behaviours - the types of provision\nmade available, the implementation of training\nprovision and the different outcomes which\nresult'.\nIn the first chapter, the authors attempt to chart\nand explain why open and distance learning\nsystems have come under the spotlight in the last\ndecade or so. The increasingly market-driven\nnature of change has forced a growing number\nof businesses and organizations to be faced with\ncompetitive challenges and reskilling needs that\nmust be met within desperately short periods of\ntime. On the other hand, although open and\nflexible learning has provided a suitable way of\nmeeting these requirements, available evidence\nquoted by the authors suggests that its\nemployment is not as significant as one would at\nat first imagine.\nOn the one hand - and as the second chapter\npoints out - there have always been a fairly\n78\ndiscernible number of groups and agencies with\na keen interest in flexible ways of delivering\nvocational education. Unfortunately, what links\nthat there have been between such circles have\nnot always produced fruitful outcomes. Now,\nthanks to increasing pressure on organizations\nfor technological and organizational adapt-\nability, the authors show the ways in which new\nproductive alliances are being formed and\noperated to certain agreed standards.\nIndeed, as the authors suggest (in the following\ntwo chapters), vocational training can only really\nsucceed if it marries up the different needs and\nexpectations of the various main players. As part\nof this process, organizations need to break\ndown and open up for dialogue the key aspects\nthat should be included when implementing a\nwell-structured cycle of course design, delivery\nand evaluation (see Chapter 5). The authors\nconclude (in Chapter 6) that the critical aspects\nof such initiatives include the pedagogical\nstructure of the programmes and the degree to\nwhich support mechanisms can motivate and\nencourage employees throughout their rather\nisolating open and flexible learning experiences.\nThe final chapter shows that the process is not\nhelped when, for example, unwillingness on the\npart of employees even to get involved with any\ntraining is actively encouraged by management -\nwho, especially in small companies, are often\noperating to tight budgets. Even in larger\norganizations, which tend to have a far better\ntrack record of late, a lack of trust may allow\nemployees to perceive training in a negative\nlight. The resulting environments are in fact\nhurtful, excluding and produce negative out-\ncomes; it would be far better and more cost-\neffective if meaningful networking arrangements\ncould be established instead.\nIn the final analysis and at a strategic level, the\ngovernment needs to clarify well-defined goals,\npriorities and standards for vocational education\nand training in the economy as a whole. It\nshould also, as part of this push, continue to\nspell out the ways in which the use of open and\ndistance-learning techniques and technologies\ncan be of relevant, lasting and wide-reaching\nbenefit. In the past, British governments were\nunfortunately hesitant about showing too much\ninvolvement and were almost alone within\nEurope in being against direct state intervention\nin training. Furthermore, those publicly funded\nopen and flexible learning ventures that were put\nin place did not produce very positive results.\nAi\u00ef-J Volume 7 Number 2\nThe problem with the Open Tech in the 1980s,\nfor example, was that money was pumped into\nvarious projects without much thought being\ngiven to creating either any coherent span of\nprovision or quality standards. The Open\nCollege was established with the best of\nintentions but, as the authors point out, in the\nend, the dream evaporated. That was, of course,\nbefore lifelong learning became an accepted\nterm; but it remains to be seen if the more\nvisionary assumptions of the latest incumbent of\nthe \"hot seat' - the University for Industry - will\nbe sustainable. A crucial job for the UFI (and its\nScottish equivalent) will be to achieve the\ncultural shift required through a promotion of\npartnership - a concept ably investigated and\nhighlighted by Calder and McCollum.\nThis book in fact provides a sound, well-\nstructured overview of its chosen subject, with\nplenty of case studies and examples from\nbusiness, public organizations and education to\nillustrate the successes and errors. Anyone\ndesiring to trace practices and developments in\nthis area over recent years could do no better\nthan consult Judith Calder and Ann\nMcCollum's work.\nGeoff Goolnik, Aberdeen College\nEamon Murphy, Lecturing at University, Curtin\nUniversity of Technology, Australia: Paradigm\nBooks, 1998. ISBN: 1-86342-669-8. A4\npaperback, viii+63 pages, no price given.\nLecturing is a demanding occupation with\nresponsibility for disseminating knowledge to\nstudents. We need to consider, in addition to this\nprimary function, the many other additional\nroles that lecturers perform such as\nadministration, seeking out funding, recruit-\nment, research and assessment - to name but a\nfew. So, what processes are prerequisites for\nlecturing at university? What are the issues\ninvolved in lecturing? What should a lecturer do\nto prepare the first lecture? What should not be\ndone? What are the good and bad attributes\nassociated with lecturing? What do you do to\nmotivate students? These are the kinds of issue\nthat are presented and discussed in detail in this\nbook.\nAs stated at the beginning, this book is designed\nboth for those who are experienced lecturers and\nfor those who are just starting out on their\nlecturing careers. The book contains many new\nideas which can be used to support and extend\ncurrent lecturing practice; it is thus well able to\nequip lecturers with everything they need in\norder to handle all the situations that they are\nlikely to encounter in a lecturing career. The\nbook even discusses the emotional perspectives\nof lecturing. The enthusiasm of the author with\nrespect to lecturing resonates throughout the\nwhole book.\nThis publication is quite short and the chapters\nare brief and to the point. The format of the\nbook is very good - the main text is very\nreadable and the layout is easy on the eyes. To\nthe left of the main text, quotations and ideas\nare listed which are relevant to the issues being\ndiscussed. These come from the extensive\nresearch undertaken in producing this book.\nIndeed, the book is augmented by extensive\nresearch involving interviews with staff and\nstudents.\nThe book consists of an introduction and eleven\nchapters. The first three chapters provide\nbackground material to the topic of lecturing.\nChapters 4 to 6 then describe what to do in\nlectures. Following on from this, Chapters 7, 8\nand 10 discuss student interactions while\nChapter 9 deals with the pros and cons of hand-\nouts and other visual aids. The final chapter\nprovides some invaluable information about\npresenting at conferences. At the end of the\nbook there is a short list of titles for\n'Recommended Reading'; this includes web-\nbased and multimedia-based references in\naddition to paper-based resources.\nChapter 1 ('Why Give Lectures?') explains the\nneed for lectures whilst', simultaneously,\nquestioning their widespread use - obviously,\nthey should fit a purpose. Chapter 2 (entitled\n'Failing to Plan is Planning to Fail'), as its title\nsuggests, is the key to successful and stress-free\nlecturing (and also how to enjoy lecturing!). This\nchapter tells us that if there is a secret to\nsuccessful lecturing, it is that 'planning carefully\nlays the foundation for success'. Together with\nthe third chapter (\"The Secret of a Good\nLecture: Preparation'), this chapter provides a\nuseful template for lecturing effectively.\nChapter 4 ('Ready, Steady, Go: Getting Started')\nand Chapter 5 (entitled 'Going Out With a\nBang: Closing off the Lecture') focus,\nrespectively, on the need to get to a good start\nand finish to lectures. The middle part of a\nlecture is where it is accepted that a lecturer\nmight drift away from the original\/intended plan\nof the lecture. Chapter 6 ('Getting Great:\n79\nReviews\nPolishing Your Presentation Skills') lists useful\nadvice on using body language amongst other\nskills to enhance lectures.\nIn Chapter 7 ('Involving Students'), Chapter 8\n('Handling Nerves and Difficult Students') and\nchapter 10 ('Lecturing to Students from Other\nCultures') the author lists additional techniques\nthat are aimed specifically at enhancing the\neffectiveness of student interactions.\nThe author uses Chapter 9 ('The Humble Hand-\nout and other Visual Aids') in order to explain\nthe virtues of using various technologies to assist\nin lecturing. The advice given is very practical\nand relevant. In the final chapter (entitled\n'Presenting at Conferences') the author explains\nand highlights presentation techniques that can\nbe used for the major types of conference event.\nOverall, this book lists, explains and describes a\nbreadth of suggestions for improving all aspects\nof lecturing. It is independent of any subject\ndomain yet covers relevant ideas applicable to all\ndisciplines. There is nothing new or complex in\nthe book yet it embodies the simple techniques\nand ideas that will make all the difference in\nevery aspect of lecturing. All advice is very\nrelevant and openly discussed, even embarras-\nsing situations which most of us would not dare\ndeclare are considered. Another attractive\nfeature of this book is the fact that practical\naspects of lecturing are put across well - without\nthe educational jargon that can often be off-\nputting to new entrants into this field.\nIn my view this text should be made mandatory\nreading for all holders of new lecturing posts\nand for existing lecturers who want to review\nwhere to go from wherever they are. Heads of\ndepartment and deans too could benefit from\nkeeping this book accessible. Of course, the\nbook could be used as a resource to support\ninduction sessions for new lecturers.\nUndoubtedly, it would help them to build up\ntheir confidence before delivering their first few\nlectures.\nHarish Ravat, De Montfort University\nP. Race and S. Brown, The Lecturer's Toolkit,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN: 0-7474-2496-\n6. A4 hardback ringbinder, vi+223 pages, \u00a375.00.\nWhat a great book! It should be on the desk of\n(and used by) every academic lecturer, whether a\nnew appointee or nearing retirement. Its detailed\nadvice on teaching and administration (not\nresearch!) is the fruit of years of staff develop-\nment by the authors and is refreshing and\nstimulating rather than prescriptive.\nThe first feel is different: it is a loose-leaf ring\nbinder rather than a bound volume so that pages\nmay be used for instructional purposes by an\nindividual lecturer or by a team of lecturers\naddressing the development of a specific area of\nteaching, learning or assessment. At first, flick-\ning through the pages is daunting; there is such a\nbreadth of coverage and mass of detail. But it is\nnot dreary, hard-to read, continuous text. It is a\nworkbook and reference companion punctuated\nwith tables to fill in, invaluable lists and bullet\npoints, self-evaluation, etc. This book is not\ndesigned just to be read but, to quote the\nauthors, it is 'intended to fuel professional\ndevelopment, and includes a considerable\nnumber of tasks and activities, which are\nintended to help you enhance usefully the ways\nthat you promote your students' learning, the\napproaches you adopt in your teaching, and\nthe ways in which you design and imple-\nment assessment of students' learning'. The\ncontents are linked to the Staff and Educational\nDevelop-ment Association (SEDA) in the\nAccreditation Scheme for Teachers in Higher\nEducation.\nThe eleven chapters look at the learning process;\nlecturing and assessment; small-group teaching,\ntutorials and practical work; flexible learning\nmaterials; student feedback; appraisal; and\nsurvival. Each chapter has a substantial list of\nreferences and sources for further reading.\nIn the first chapter an interactive series of\nquestions effectively guides the participant (not\nreader - shades of workshop presentation) to\nidentifying the main factors behind successful\nlearning and recognizing that learning is not a\nsimple cyclical process but involves overlap of\nwanting, doing, feedback and digesting.\nThe second chapter 'Refreshing Your Lecturing'\nis a key chapter and justifiably the longest. It is\naimed at staff required to give lectures to large\ngroups of students and who are looking for\nguidelines for preparing, planning and\npresenting material as well as enhancing and\nevaluating performance. An experienced lecturer\nhas much to gain as has a new lecturer. Then,\nafter querying the need for assessment, the\nauthors systematically address ten forms of\nassessment ranging from traditional examina-\ntions and essays to portfolios and vivas. The\nadvantages and disadvantages of each method\nare listed along with ways by which they can be\n80\nALT-) Volume 7 Number 2\nimproved. Again, there are exercises designed to\nmake lecturers think about the effectiveness and\nquality of their own assessment methods.\nSmall-group teaching is quite different from\nformal lecturing. It can be a disaster unless very\ncarefully planned; the seminar, tutorial or\npractical does not free-wheel! The two chapters\ndevoted to this area provide excellent lists of\n'how not to do it' and 'what can go wrong' as well\nas advice on, for example, dealing with students\nand even learning and using their names. The\nauthors provide very useful guidance on small-\ngroup process techniques such as buzz groups,\nsyndicates, fishbowls, brainstorming, etc.\nIn the UK, flexible, resource-based learning is\nincreasing dramatically. Two chapters address\nthe choice and design of flexible learning\nmaterials, and ways of helping students to learn\nfrom these resources. There is an extremely\nvaluable quality checklist of some thirty points\ncovering objectives, structure, self-assessment\nand feedback, introductions and summaries, text\nand graphics.\nOnly a single chapter is devoted to project,\npractical and laboratory work but it covers in\ndetail ways of enhancing the effectiveness of\nprojects; assessing presentations, dissertations,\nreviews, performances, poster displays and\nexhibitions; as well as enhancing and assessing\npractic\u00e1is and laboratories.\nLater chapters may be loosely considered as\ndealing with administration in the guise of\npreparing oneself for appraisal and performance\nreview, obtaining reliable feedback from\nstudents, and surviving as an effective member\nof staff. There are a myriad of 'tips' on coping\nwith stress, meetings and paperwork, managing\ntime, as well as 'trips' and 'traps'.\nFour final pages provide an invaluable self-\nexamination presented as 'values for learning,\nteaching and assessment'. Under each of these\nthree headings is a list of essential attributes,\nsuch as 'teaching should be dynamic',\n'assessment must be reliable', etc. There follows\na succinct sentence outlining requirements in\nthis context, then readers are questioned as to\nhow their methods meet these requirements.\nPresentation makes this book. With its variety, it\nis so easy to dip into as well as to read page-by-\npage. It is active and sympathetic, ever construc-\ntive and enthusiastic, never paternalistic.\nGordon Ritchie, University of Essex\nS. Higgins, N. Packard and P. Race, 500 ICT\nTips for Primary Teachers, London: Kogan Page,\n1999. ISBN 0-7494-2863-5. Paperback, viii+200\npages, \u00a315.99.\nThe difficulties faced by many primary teachers\nin attempting to adopt ICT-based approaches to\nteaching and learning, since the early 1980s, have\nspawned a plethora of 'practical guides'. These\nhave tended to be 'light' on philosophy and\n'heavy' on 'tips' for classroom success. If the\nnature of this particular example of the genre is\nnot obvious from its title then reading the first\ntip in the chapter giving reasons why primary\nteachers should consider teaching about\nICT - 'Because you have to . . . \" - makes it very\nclear.\nThe practical philosophy of this book is clearly\nstated by the authors at the outset and lived up\nto throughout. Chapters are clearly and\nmeaningfully labelled, logically grouped and\ncontain short clear answers to, in the main,\ncommonly occurring problems in the classroom\nor in school management. Some tips have the\naddition of a small icon indicating relative\nimportance with respect to other tips on the page\nor matching the information to a pupil stage.\nThere are sixty-five sections grouped in eleven\nchapters and supplemented by six appendices. In\ntotal, as the authors admit, there are in excess of\nseven hundred tips and it is this 'generosity'\nwhich may indicate the only real need for\nimprovement, with a view to helping the reader\nwho does not have a prior and broad overview of\nICT in education. Perhaps a short structured\nintroduction to the book and its components,\nmade coherent by a diagram, would make for\neasier use of the advice that follows. The style\nadopted in Open University study guides is a\ngood model.\nChapter 1 sets the scene for ICT use, dealing\nwith accommodation requirements and\nintroducing themes covered in more detail by\nlater chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 provide a\n'punchy' rationale, accepting optimistic views of\nICT's potential to enhance learning and\narticulate ICT's links with the National\nCurriculum for England and Wales. Chapter 3\nrequires the Scottish reader to do a little\ntranslation of terminology but is still useful. All\nof the other sections are sufficiently generic as to\nbe helpful to teachers working well beyond the\nNational Curriculum area.\nChapter 4 covers the use of ICT with pupils who\n81\nReviews\nhave Special educational needs. This field, with\nits wide range of physical devices, perhaps most\nof all, would have benefited from pictorial rep-\nresentation. A link here to web-sites such as the\nSpecial Education Microelectronics Resource\nCentre or SEMERC (mentioned in th\u00e9 append-\nices) would help readers to find visual references.\nAlso, the inclusion in this chapter of a section\nconcerned with stretching more able pupils is\ngood to see. ICT does have a particular potential\nfor pupils unchallenged by the core curriculum\nin primary schools.\nChapter 5 advises on resource issues in a fairly\ngeneral way for class teachers as well as for ICT\nco-ordinators, while Chapter 8 goes into greater\ndepth and introduces new themes of particular\ninterest to the latter group. This is a sensible\ndistinction that the reader might benefit from\nseeing made explicit in the kind of introductory\ndiagram suggested above.\nThe critical importance of assessing ICT is given\ndue attention, with its own chapter (6). Teachers\nface particular problems in accessing and in\nprocessing evidence of attainment using ICT.\nThis is a particularly strong section which, as\nsuggested above, would benefit from greater\n'visibility' in an opening diagram.\nChapters 7 and 9 provide the school ICT co-\nordinator or headteacher with very useful advice\non the fundamental tasks of managing ICT and\nof supporting colleagues. Research has shown\nthe key role played by promoted staff in support-\ning and in expecting ICT use by classroom\nteachers.\nThe Internet, as might be expected at this time, is\nthe subject of the biggest chapter (10).\nSurprisingly, the publishers have not decorated\nthe book's cover with any marketable reference\nto the Internet or World Wide Web. This, again,\nis rich with clear, detailed and helpful advice.\nPerhaps the excellent guide to useful educational\nweb-sites might have been better brought\nforward from the appendices into this section.\nFinally, Chapter 10 offers advice on\n'troubleshooting' and the development of 'good\nhabits'. The appendices include an extensive\nguide to ICT terminology or jargon.\nOverall, bearing in mind its clearly stated purpose,\nthis is a reasonably easy to use and very well\nstocked collection of practical advice that would\nbe of value to the staff of any primary school.\nJohn Robertson, University of Paisley\n82\nPeter Lassey, Developing a Learning Organisa-\ntion, London: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN: 0-7474-\n2413-3. Paperback, x+192 pages, \u00a318.99.\nThe publication of a 'how to' book on\ndeveloping a learning organization is timely\ngiven the emphasis of the Dearing Report on\nlifelong learning and coping with change. As\nLassey points out, the pace of change in modern\ntimes is rapid, and organizations, like individ-\nuals, have to keep abreast of change in order to\nreact appropriately. The book is divided into\nthree parts. Part 1, which is by far the longest\nsection (70 pages), looks at the structures within\norganizations that can help to develop a learning\norganization. It also examines how occupational\nstandards can be used to facilitate a coherent set\nof systems and procedures, job descriptions and\nappraisal systems that underpin a learning\norganization. Part 2 (containing 28 pages) looks\nat developing people within the organization. It\nexamines how people can develop solutions to\nbusiness problems and how flexible training and\ndevelopment activities can be implemented to\nmeet learning needs. Part 3 (26 pages) focuses on\nexternal recognition for the organization and its\npeople through NVQ, Investor in People and\nISO 9000 certification.\nThe book begins (Chapter 1) with a general\nintroduction encompassing definitions of a\nLearning Organization, e.g. 'an organization\nwith an ingrained philosophy for anticipating,\nreacting and responding to change, complexity\nand uncertainty'. The chapter also identifies the\nfeatures of a learning organization (e.g. learns\nfrom mistakes, trains employees, encourages\nexperimentation and staff suggestions, practises\ndevolution of power) as opposed to traditional\norganizations (e.g. punishes mistakes, sends\nemployees on training course, discourages ex-\nperimentation and staff suggestion, has a com-\nmand and control management). This\nintroduction effectively sets the scene for\nsubsequent chapters.\nPart \\ (Chapters 2-6) is entitled 'Organising the\nLearning Environment'. Chapter 2 introduces\nthe concept of competence. It describes how a\nworkable model of job competence should\ninclude all the necessary skills, i.e. knowledge to\nadapt to changing situations, interpersonal,\nsocial and communication skills, an under-\nstanding of the job, organization and the\nindustry, basic numeracy and literacy, a positive\nattitude to the success of themselves and the\norganization, the confidence and a will to act.\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nThe UK driving test is used as a compelling\nexample of how to measure competence.\nNational Competence Standards, NVQ\n(National Vocational Qualifications) and SVQs\n(Scottish Vocational Qualifications) are\nintroduced and critically discussed. Problems are\nmentioned, for example, occupational standards\nare, of necessity, generic and need interpretation\nfor specific situations. Useful suggestions are\nmade as to how to tailor existing occupational\nstandards to meet the needs of an organization.\nChapter 3 demonstrates how competence\/\noccupational standards can be used to develop\ndynamic systems and procedures and also check\nlists and proformas. The chapter contains several\nnuggets of useful advice, e.g. when designing\nsystems and procedures always involve the\noperator. The pros and cons of setting up\ndocumented systems, procedures and proformas\n(as for ISO 9000) are discussed. Such documenta-\ntion takes large amounts of time and effort,\nwhich is advisable where mistakes are costly, but\nmay not always be worthwhile. Chapter 4\nexplores how competence standards can be used\nto produce job descriptions and can form the\nbasis of an appraisal system. Lassey points out\nthat both employers and employees tend to\nfavour hazy job descriptions. Often employers\nnegate the precision of a job description by\nadding an 'anything the manager asks' clause. A\ndescription of an appraisal system is given which\nincludes general points but not enough detail to\nset up such a system. Several germane comments\nare made, for example, the importance of\nsupport and development for appraisers.\nAssessing performance (Chapter 5) is vital to\ndetermining what development is needed by a\nlearner and also to measure the effectiveness of\ntraining. The importance of impartial, objective\njudgement is emphasized. Key pitfalls of the\ninexperienced assessor are listed, e.g. 'halo' or\n'horns' effects, judgements based on exceptional\nevents or on erroneous beliefs or which ignore\ncontext. It is pointed out that both performance\nand knowledge evidence should be collected and\na useful supporting section gives hints on\nquestioning techniques to elicit information.\nNVQ assessment is held up as best practice to\nwhich assessors should aspire. Chapter 6\ndescribes how a learning organization in manag-\ning quality and change should 'harness the\nintellect of this work force'. The key role for the\nmanager is to empower staff and to promote the\nuse of problem-solving tools in creative ways.\nThe point is well made that managers must\nappreciate that their main resource is their staff.\nQuality is defined as 'fit for its intended\npurpose'. Ten quality enhancement conditions\nare presented in table form and the concept of\nquality circles is introduced. There is a useful\nsection on techniques for identifying and\nresolving quality problems with explicit\ninstructions on leading discussion groups and\nmeetings.\nPart 2 (Chapters 7-9) is entitled 'Developing\nPeople'. There is an attempt at the beginning of\nChapter 7 on learning and coaching to introduce\nlearning theory. However, the brief account does\nnot do justice to the complexities of the\nunderlying psychological research. Furthermore,\nthe concepts are not picked up meaningfully in\nlater sections. The practical sections on the\nimportance of motivation and the benefits of\ncoaching are much better. There are useful tips\non how to coach.\nChapter 8 concentrates on how learning can be\nflexible and focused on the individual learner. It\nincludes a section on personal development\nplans. The attributes of open and distance\nlearning and flexible learning materials are\ndiscussed. A pertinent point is that such\nmaterials are most effectively utilized with the\nhelp of a coach. Learning projects are also\nmentioned and advice given on how to initiate\nsuch projects. Chapter 9 focuses on the designing\nand management of a learning resource centre.\nSuch a centre is felt to be essential for supporting\nflexible learning. Detailed advice is given\nincluding a list of suitable equipment and even\nsuggestions regarding opening times. The indi-\nvidual's use of the centre is not neglected and\ninduction procedures and the use of learning files\nis mentioned. The latter can provide good evi-\ndence for Investors in People (IiP) - see Part 3.\nPart 3 (Chapters 10-12) is entitled 'Gaining\nRecognition'. Chapter 10 gives an account of the\nInvestors in People standard and elaborates on\nthe four main principles of commitment,\nplanning, action and evaluation. An appropriate\noverview is provided which, however, does not\nconvey the amount of preparation and hard\nwork that IiP recognition entails. Chapter 11\nprovides a detailed account of NVQs\/SVQs and\nthe associated quality assurance systems and\nassessment criteria. It also shows how\norganizations can become approved assessment\ncentres and covers assessors' training, centre\nmanagement and internal verification. This\nchapter gives a very clear impression of the\n83\nReviews\ndifferent development stages and the amount of\nwork involved.\nChapter 12 covers ISO 9000, BS5750 and Total\nQuality Management (TQM). ISO 9000 and the\nUK equivalent BS5750 are recognition systems\nbased on the documentation of systems and\nprocedures. Implementation, including systems\nmanuals and internal auditing, is described. The\nTQM approach is through customer satisfaction\nand involves all members in improving all\naspects of the organization and its culture. TQM\nis often seen as an alternative to ISO 9000 but\nLassey suggests it represents the next step on the\nquality ladder. Strictly TQM is an approach\nrather than a standard.\nThere is useful detailed supporting information\nin the appendices, a page of thought-provoking\nfurther reading and a helpful index. The\nreference list appears rather sparse. The\n'remember' boxes to highlight important points\nare useful and could be used more extensively. In\ngeneral the book is exactly what it purports to\nbe, i.e. an introductory guide. There is often a\ngreat deal of detailed information but imple-\nmentation of the various stages in becoming a\nlearning organization would require more in-\ndepth consideration of the issues. One of the\nbook's strengths is its practical 'hands on'\napproach with only a few diversions into\nunderlying theory or discussions of controversial\nissues. The subject matter is not new but it is\npresented in a convenient readable format. It is a\nuseful text for managers in large or medium-\nsized organizations.\nBeryl Starr, University of Hertfordshire\nJen Harvey (ed.), Evaluation Cookbook, Learning\nTechnology Dissemination Initiative, Edinburgh:\nHeriot-Watt University, 1998. ISBN: 0-9528731-\n6-8. Paperback, 88 pages, no cost.\nThis book is aimed at evaluation in the domain\nof learning and teaching where educational\ninnovations, for example, a computer-assisted\nlearning (CAL) package, are evaluated for their\neffectiveness in achieving \u2022 specific learning\noutcomes. Based on the outcomes, action is\ntaken, for example a package that is under\ndevelopment is redesigned or a decision is made\nto purchase an existing training simulator. Two\nmain types of evaluation are formative\nevaluation (described in the book as 'when the\ncook tastes the soup') and summative evaluation\n('when the dinner guest tastes the soup').\n84\nA wide range of evaluation techniques exists,\nincluding both quantitative and qualitative.\nFrequently, a suitable combination of different\ntechniques can be useful to establish the\neffectiveness of an educational innovation.\nHowever, it is rare to find a comprehensive range\nof techniques applied to learning and teaching\nand concisely described in a single volume. This\nbook is filling this gap and can be downloaded\nfree of charge from the World Wide Web\n(http:\/\/www.icbl.hw.ac.uk\/ltdi\/cookbook\/).\nThis publication is a practical guide for lecturers\nwho want to evaluate learning materials. By\ncombining the methods and other ideas\ncontained in this book they can design and carry\nout their own evaluation studies to inform their\neducational practice. Although the book is\ngeared towards CAL, it applies generally to a\nbroad range of educational innovations.\nThe book contains forty-two chapters. Most of\nthese consist of one or two pages. However,\ntaken together, the chapters cover a substantial\nrange of evaluation methods, although they are\nobviously not treated in extensive detail.\nNaturally, the book contains a section with\nliterature references that should allow readers to\nobtain more details of specific methods that they\nmay want to apply themselves. The edited book\nalso includes a section with contact details for\nthe authors who each contribute one or more\nchapters. Unfortunately, there is no index, which\nmakes it more difficult to find particular topics\nrelating to the evaluation methods covered by\nthe book.\nLogically, the rest of the book is organized into\nfive broad sections. The first of these discusses\nthe preparation of an evaluation. The second\nand third sections form the most important part\nof the text; they cover evaluation methods and\nsupplementary information respectively.\nUnfortunately, the chapters from these two\nsections are interspersed in a way that is neither\nobvious to the reader nor systematic. The fourth\nsection deals with reflecting and acting on evalu-\nation results and the write-up of an evaluation\nstudy. Finally, the fifth section presents case\nstudies that illustrate the use of various methods,\nseparately or in combination, to inform the\npractice of learning and teaching.\nThe first three chapters provide a framework for\nplanning and preparing an evaluation in terms\nof stakeholders, what will be evaluated and how\nthis will be done. Of the next thirty chapters,\neighteen ('recipe pages' in black print on a white\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nbackground) deal with methods and describe\ntheir main uses, procedures for applying the\nmethods, variations on the methods, links to\nother methods and supplementary information.\nThese chapters are interspersed with twelve\nchapters ('information pages' printed in black on\na pink background) that offer practical\nsuggestions and advice that apply to a range of\ndifferent evaluation methods. The first chapter\non evaluation methods is a quick guide to the\nmethods and describes these in terms of relative\nresourcing implications; this information is\nsummarized in each of the chapters that describe\nthe separate methods.\nThe following eight evaluation methods that are\npresented in the method chapters are of a\n(predominantly) qualitative nature. Checklists\ncan be used to check whether a range of\nmaterials fit certain standard criteria and to\nmeasure how materials match students' needs.\nConcept maps can be employed to assess\nstudents' knowledge of conceptual structures.\nEthnography can be applied to account for the\nobserved setting of learning and teaching in\nlongitudinal studies, to investigate a user's point\nof view in participative design, to clarify\nrequirements and provide continuous feedback\nin iterative system development. Focus groups\ncan be utilized in formative and summative\nevaluation, in particular to provide input for the\nuse of other evaluation methods and to com-\nplement the results obtained from these.\nInterviews can also be employed in formative\nand summative evaluation to obtain perspectives\non evaluation targets from different stake-\nholders. Split screen video can be applied to\nobtain feedback for software development (in\nformative evaluation) and for piloting software\nto provide information for subsequent imple-\nmentation as part of a course. Uses of\nsupplemental observation include the evaluation\nof existing resources introduced into a new\ncourse and rapid feedback to system develop-\nment. System log data can, for example, be\nutilized for usability evaluation of software and\nto supplement other evaluation methods.\nThe following four evaluation methods discussed\nin the method chapters are (mainly) quantitative.\nConfidence logs can be used to investigate,\nthrough self-assessment, how students' learning\ndevelops over time. Cost-effectiveness analysis\ncan, for example, be employed to compare\ndifferent candidate programs to supplement a\ncourse and to determine which program has the\nbest average outcome per student relative to the\nper student cost. Controlled experiments can be\nutilized to determine which factors of an educa-\ntional innovation influence learning outcomes.\nPre- and post-testing can be applied to establish\nthe gain in terms of learning outcomes from the\nuse of an educational innovation.\nThe following four evaluation methods included\nin the method chapters are of both a qualitative\nand a quantitative nature. Nominal group\ntechniques can be used to identify and prioritize\nissues to be investigated by other methods.\nQuestionnaires can be employed to obtain feed-\nback on an educational innovation by obtaining\nviews and\/or factual information from people.\nResource questionnaires can be applied to\ninvestigate the actual use of resources and their\nusefulness. Trials can be utilized for obtaining\nfeedback on the use of educational innovations\nin order to make improvements during different\ndevelopment stages. The chapter containing a\nrecipe for chocolate cake proved very useful to\nthe reviewer.\nThe twelve chapters ('information pages') with\npractical suggestions and advice include the\nfollowing topics: (1) the relation between\neducational innovations and the context in\nwhich these are used; (2) Likert scales (used in\nquestionnaires); (3) learning styles; (4) the use of\nstatistical methods; (5) selecting student\nsamples; (6) working with evaluation particip-\nants; (7) guidelines for interviews; (8) the use of\npre- and post-testing; (9) merits and demerits of\nquestionnaires; (10) writing questions; (11)\ntranscribing qualitative data; and (12) planning\nthe use of educational media as part of a course.\nThe first of two chapters that make up section\nfour discuss different types of evaluation\noutcome and their implications for learning and\nteaching practice. The second chapter presents\nan outline for reporting evaluations. Unfort-\nunately, the nine chapters in section five, which\nprovide examples of applying the evaluation\nmethods, do not follow the format of the\nevaluation report outline. However, the examples\nstill contain useful information on how to apply\nand combine the various methods for evaluating\neducational innovations in practice. These\nchapters would have been more useful if\nreferences to original reports on the evaluation\nstudies had been included.\nThe references section includes general literature\non evaluation, educational publications that\ninclude a discussion of evaluation methods, web-\nsites dealing with (educational) evaluation and\n85\nReviews\nfurther reading related to particular methods. In\ngeneral, the book would have gained from\n'beefing up' the references. In particular, there is\nan imbalance in the number of references\nrelating to the different methods, and references\nto statistical methods, which can be invaluable in\nan evaluation, are disappointingly scarce.\nOverall, I think this book offers a useful\nintroduction to the topic of educational\nevaluation for teachers who themselves want to\nevaluate. Although the evaluation methods are\ndescribed only briefly, they are mostly written in\nan understandable and readable fashion and\ncase studies and references are included, which\nallow readers to obtain more detailed informa-\ntion for planning and conducting their own\nevaluations. This book should stimulate the\nappropriate use of evaluation methods by\nteachers to inform learning and teaching in both\nacademic and non-academic contexts.\nPaul van Schaik, University of Teesside\nDavid Boud and Grahame Feletti (eds.), The\nChallenge of Problem-Based Learning, London:\nKogan Page, 2nd edn., 1998. ISBN: 0-7494-2560-\n1. Paperback, viii+344 pages, \u00a319.99.\nThis book sets out to explore problem-based\nlearning, its significance, how it can be used and\nits strengths and limitations. It is directed at\nthose who are interested in the method for\nteaching and learning and who want to assess\nhow it might address central issues in\nprofessional education. Problem-based learning\nis a way of constructing and teaching courses\nusing problems as the stimulus and focus for\nstudent activity, in this way moving students\ntowards the acquisition of knowledge and skills,\nthrough a staged sequence of problems\npresented in context, together with associated\nlearning materials and support from tutors.\nThe rationale for the book is to discuss the\nstrengths and limitations of problem-based\nlearning, explore how can it be implemented and\ngive examples in practice. The text is divided into\nsix parts, each with a clearly defined purpose\nsummarized in the section introduction.\nPart 1 asks the question: 'What is problem-based\nlearning?' The contributors of the chapters that\nmake up this section consider what instructional\nmethods constitute problem-based learning, and\nsuggest that it is learning for capability in the\nform of competencies for the students' working\nlife. It encourages open-minded reflective,\n86\ncritical and active learning, which is more\nstructured than discovery learning, and is the\nmethod of choice for effective adult learning.\nChapter 2 includes useful tables of competencies\nand descriptions of some of the sessions the\nauthors have used.\nPart 2 is entitled 'getting started', and each\nchapter discusses a different stage of the\ndevelopment of problem-based learning and\nstrategies for getting started. Three questions are\nanswered here:\n1. Is there a generally useful process for getting\nany innovation started?\n2. How does a problem-based approach com-\npare with other educational innovations?\n3. What other dimensions seem to be important\nin getting started?\nIn considering problem-based learning there\nmust be a clear purpose to its introduction, and\nsupport by senior academics is essential.\nPreparation of problem-based learning courses\ncan be labour-intensive and adequate facilities\nmust be available, if problem-based learning is to\nbring about a change from efficient teaching to\neffective learning. The chapters recount anec-\ndotes on the difficulties of introducing problem-\nbased learning, and some of the successful\nmethods used, so the negative as well as the\npositive points are brought out in this part.\nPart 3 deals with 'issues and questions',\nincluding an emphasis on the change of role\nfrom lecturer to facilitator necessitating ap-\npropriate training. Tutors need to be able to\nstimulate and guide the students' progress\nthrough questioning and feedback. It is\nsuggested that problem-based learning is\nbeneficial for adult and non-traditional learners.\nThere is also concern that students do not\ndevelop adequate knowledge structures - they\nneed plenty of time for reflection, but sometimes\ntoo many concepts and issues are presented. The\nexamples use various combinations of lectures,\ntutorials, laboratory sessions and conferences to\nsupport the problem-based learning, much\ndepending upon the particular cases being\nstudied and the stage of learning reached. In\nChapter 15 there is a useful flowchart for\nproduction of problem-based learning courses,\nwith an emphasis on it being a different art from\ntraditional course production.\nProblem-based learning has been applied in\nmedical fields for some time, but recently its use\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 2\nin other subject areas has generated interest. Part\n4 presents several variations in problem-based\nlearning as it has been applied in different\nsubjects, most of which are smaller in scale than\nthe medical examples. The examples include\nmechanical engineering, social work, architect-\nure and computing, where industrial partners\nmight present the problems chosen for study or\nproblems may arise from the previous experience\nof the course designers. The common feature is\nthat the cases involve applying the topics studied\nto a real-world problem, where the human\nelement needs to be taken into consideration.\nRegardless of the teaching methods used, the\nstudents need to be assessed in order to give\nthem a grade for the course. Problem-based\nlearning is often group-based, with its own\nparticular problems for assessment. Part 5 looks\nat student assessment, giving several views as to\nwhat and how learning should be assessed. This\npart also considers the difficult task of\nevaluating problem-based learning programmes,\nand suggests that much more work needs to be\ncarried out on ways to evaluate such courses.\nThe final part of the book considers future\ntrends in problem-based learning and its\nrelationship to other forms of experiential\nlearning. There is a useful chapter on learning\ntheory, and the last chapter gives a good\nsummary of the potential benefits and difficulties\nin introducing problem-based learning.\nOverall, most applications of problem-based\nlearning have been in the medical field, but the\nexamples show that it is applicable wherever a\nprofessional needs to be able to deal with people,\nwhich might cover almost any field. The book\nprovides a comprehensive guide to problem-\nbased learning. First published in 1991, some of\nthe chapters in this second edition have been\nrevised, though much of the learning theory\nincluded will not have changed. Nevertheless, the\ntext remains an essential read for anyone\nconsidering introducing problem-based learning\nfor courses, whether to cover the whole\ncurriculum or just in part. A question for ALT\nmembers is to consider how technology can\nsupport problem-based learning, which is only\nhinted at in this book.\nJanice Whatley, Stockport College of Further and\nHigher Education\n87\n"}
