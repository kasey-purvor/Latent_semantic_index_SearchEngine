NPCs serve the cell\u2019s require-\nment for bidirectional, selective, diverse, and high-volume\ntransport between these two compartments (for review see\nAllen et al., 2000; Ryan and Wente, 2000; Fahrenkrog et al.,\n2001; Rout and Aitchison, 2001; Vasu and Forbes, 2001).\n \nUltrastructural analyses of the NPC using transmission electron\n(Akey, 1989; Ris, 1989, 1991; Jarnik and Aebi, 1991;\nHinshaw et al., 1992; Akey and Radermacher, 1993), scan-\nning electron (Goldberg and Allen, 1993, 1996; Ris and\nMalecki, 1993; Ris, 1997), and atomic force (Rakowska et\nal., 1998; Stoffler et al., 1999b) microscopy has shown the\nvertebrate NPC to be an \n \n\u0002\n \n65-nm deep, plugged channel,\ndecorated on each side with eight filaments attached to a\ncoaxial ring that project away from the nuclear envelope\n(NE). Although the \n \n\u0002\n \n40\u201350-nm filaments of the nuclear\nface join together at their distal ends to form a so-called\nnuclear basket or fishtrap (Goldberg and Allen, 1993, 1996;\nRis and Malecki, 1993; Ris, 1997), the \n \n\u0002\n \n35\u201350-nm filaments\nof the cytoplasmic side are not joined (Jarnik and Aebi,\n1991; Goldberg and Allen, 1993).\n \nAddress correspondence to Maarten Fornerod, The Netherlands Cancer\nInstitute H4, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nTel.: 31-20-512-2024.

To help un-\nderstand the molecular organization of the NPC, these nucle-\noporins have been mapped to NPC subdomains using im-\nmunogold electron microscopy. In yeast, transmission EM\n(TEM) studies of protein A\u2013tagged nucleoporins have shown\nthat the majority of these map to both sides of the NPC (Rout\net al., 2000). Exceptions that map exclusively to the cytoplas-\nmic face are Nup159\/Rat7 and Nup82 (Kraemer et al., 1995;\nHurwitz et al., 1998; Rout et al., 2000). Even though regional\ninformation has been obtained for many nucleoporins, the\nrather low degree of structural definition of the NPC in trans-\nmission immuno-EM did not generally allow individual nu-\ncleoporins to be attributed to particular NPC substructures. In\nhigher eukaryotes, three nucleoporins have been mapped to\nthe cytoplasmic side of the NPC: CAN\/Nup214 (Kraemer et\nal., 1994; Pante et al., 1994), Nup88\/Nup84 (Bastos et al.,\n1997), and RanBP2\/Nup358 (Wu et al., 1995; Yokoyama et\nal., 1995). RanBP2\/Nup358, which has no identifiable yeast\nhomologue, is the largest nucleoporin and has been localized\nto the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC (Wilken et al., 1995;\nWu et al., 1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995). It contains four\nRanGTP binding domains, highly similar in sequence to the\none present in RanBP1. RanBP1 and isolated RanBP1-homol-\nogous domains of RanBP2 serve as Ran GTPase coactivators\n(Beddow et al., 1995; Bischoff et al., 1995; Richards et al.,\n1995; Schlenstedt et al., 1995; Villa Braslavsky et al., 2000),\nassisting the dissociation of RanGTP from importins (Bischoff\nand Gorlich, 1997; Floer et al., 1997; Schlenstedt et al., 1997)\nand exportin\u2013cargo complexes (Kutay et al., 1998; Askjaer et\nal., 1999; Kehlenbach et al., 1999). RanBP2 also contains two\nZinc fingers of the type predicted to bind RanGDP (Nakielny\net al., 1999; Yaseen and Blobel, 1999b), and a number of\nloosely spaced FG repeats, providing potential binding sites for\ntransport receptors. Furthermore, RanBP2\/Nup358 serves as a\nbinding site for the SUMO1-modified form of RanGAP1, the\nRanGTPase activating protein (Matunis et al., 1996, 1998;\nMahajan et al., 1997). Recently, it has been shown that\nRanBP2 itself acts as an E3 ligase in the sumoylation reaction\n(Pichler et al., 2002). Purified RanBP2\/Nup358 forms \n \n\u0002\n \n36-\nnm long, 5-nm thick filaments (Delphin et al., 1997), corre-\nsponding approximately to the size of the cytoplasmic fila-\nments (Jarnik and Aebi, 1991), suggesting that RanBP2 could\nbe the main constituent of the cytoplasmic NPC filaments.\nCAN\/Nup214 and Nup88\/Nup84 form a cytoplasmi-\ncally oriented nucleoporin subcomplex (Bastos et al., 1997;\nFornerod et al., 1997). Based on immunogold EM studies\n(Kraemer et al., 1994; Pante et al., 1994), CAN\/Nup214 is\ngenerally also referred to as a component of the cytoplasmic\nfilaments. Genetic depletion of CAN\/Nup214 in early\nmouse embryos resulted in reduced nuclear localization se-\nquence (NLS)\u2013mediated protein import, and strong nuclear\npoly(A)\n \n\u0004\n \n RNA accumulation (van Deursen et al., 1996),\nwhereas mutation of the \n \nDrosophila\n \n homologue of Nup88,\n \nmbo\n \n, results in a specific protein import defect without pro-\nnounced nuclear mRNA retention (Uv et al., 2000).\nSeveral lines of evidence have suggested a role of the cytoplas-\nmic filaments in nuclear import. EM analysis of nuclear import\n \nof NLS-conjugated gold was found to involve multiple stages\n(Feldherr et al., 1984) that were subsequently specified as en-\nergy-independent binding (\u201cdocking\u201d) of the import complex\nto the nuclear periphery and translocation to the nucleus (New-\nmeyer and Forbes, 1988; Richardson et al., 1988). Import com-\nplexes were enriched at fibrillar structures on the cytoplasmic\nface of the NPC (Newmeyer and Forbes, 1988; Richardson et\nal., 1988; Rutherford et al., 1997). Furthermore, it was found\nthat inhibition of nuclear import by nonhydrolysable analogues\nof GTP lead to accumulation of RanGTP at the cytoplasmic fil-\naments (Melchior et al., 1995). In vitro, RanGTP binds to\nRanBP2\/Nup358 and stimulates binding of the NLS import\nreceptor importin \n \n\u0003\n \n to this nucleoporin (Melchior et al., 1995;\nChi et al., 1996; Saitoh et al., 1996; Delphin et al., 1997;\nYaseen and Blobel, 1999a). Antibodies to RanBP2-bound\nRanGAP1 reduced nuclear import efficiency, that could only\nbe partially rescued by soluble RanGAP (Mahajan et al., 1997).\nThese data were interpreted as evidence that RanBP2 serves as a\ndocking site for incoming NLS import cargos, and that\nRanGTP played a controlling role in nuclear protein import\n(Melchior et al., 1995; Delphin et al., 1997; Mahajan et al.,\n1997; Yaseen and Blobel, 1999a). Observations of colloidal\ngold-labeled substrates during import showed association of the\ngold particles at two or three discrete sites of the cytoplasmic fil-\naments (Akey and Goldfarb, 1989; Pante and Aebi, 1996), and\nfilament bending toward the center of the NPC was reported\n(Pante and Aebi, 1996; Rutherford et al., 1997). It was sug-\ngested that docking of NLS cargos provokes the filaments to\nbend inwards and deliver them to the translocation channel.\nCytoplasmic NPC filaments have also been proposed to con-\ntribute to excluding nonimport cargos from the nucleus by\ntheir Brownian movement (Rout et al., 2000). Antibodies to a\nlarge region of the RanBP2 protein inhibit import of an NLS-\ncontaining substrate (Yokoyama et al., 1995), strengthening the\nidea that RanBP2\/Nup358 and the cytoplasmic NPC filaments\nplay an essential role in nuclear import.\nBiochemical depletion of nucleoporins from \n \nXenopus\n \n egg\nextracts in which nuclear assembly on added chromatin tem-\nplates takes place has been used to produce nuclei whose\nNPCs lack specific components (Finlay and Forbes, 1990;\nFinlay et al., 1991; Powers et al., 1995; Grandi et al., 1997;\nWalther et al., 2001). Here we address the question of the\ncomposition of the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC and\ntheir role in nuclear import by analysis of two cytoplasmically\noriented nucleoporins, CAN\/Nup214 and RanBP2\/Nup358.\nWe find that whereas RanBP2\/Nup358 is an essential part of\nthe cytoplasmic filaments, CAN\/Nup214 is not part of these\nstructures. Surprisingly, given the indirect evidence for an im-\nport role cited above, NPCs lacking cytoplasmic filaments\nshow no deficiency in NLS or M9 mediated nuclear accumu-\nlation, indicating that these structures have no essential func-\ntion in the nuclear import of bulk import cargos.\n \nResults\n \nImmunoelectron microscopic localization of \nCAN\/Nup214 and RanBP2\/Nup358\n \nThe only three known vertebrate nucleoporins exclusively lo-\ncalized to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC are CAN\/Nup214,\nNup88, and RanBP2\/Nup358, of which the former two form\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published July 8, 2002\n NPC filaments and nuclear import |\n \n Walther et al. 65\n \na subcomplex. Because we intended to functionally character-\nize the role of the cytoplasmic filaments in nuclear transport,\nwe first wished to reinvestigate the localization of RanBP2\/\nNup358 and CAN\/Nup214 within the NPC. To this end we\nanalyzed immunogold labeled \n \nXenopus laevis\n \n oocyte NEs us-\ning field emission in-lens scanning EM (FEISEM), which\nprovides a surface view of the NPC, and TEM, providing a\ncross-sectional view. For immunolocalization of RanBP2\/\nNup358, two polyclonal antibodies were used. One, anti-\nNup358F, had been raised against a recombinant COOH-\nterminal segment, comprising amino acids 2501\u20132900 of the\nhuman homologue. The other, anti-Nup358V, was directed\nagainst amino acids 2285\u20132314 of human Nup358, of which\nresidues 2290\u20132314 are identical in \n \nXenopus\n \n and mammals.\nFor immunolocalization of CAN\/Nup214, polyclonal anti-\nbodies were raised against an NH\n \n2\n \n-terminal segment of the\n \nXenopus\n \n protein, comprising amino acids 1\u2013213. All antibod-\nies were affinity purified and recognized proteins of expected\nsizes in Western blots of \n \nXenopus\n \n cell extracts (see Fig. 3 A).\nFor immuno-EM, isolated NEs were incubated with\nprimary antibodies, followed by labeling with 10-nm\ngold-conjugated secondary antibodies. Representative im-\nages of FEISEM micrographs are shown in Fig. 1, A\n(CAN\/Nup214), B (RanBP2\/Nup358, antibody 358F),\nand C (RanBP2\/Nup358, antibody 358V). The localiza-\ntion of at least 100 gold-labeled antibodies was deter-\nmined for each nucleoporin by measuring the distance\nfrom the center of the NPC to the center of the gold-\nlabeled antibodies. No significant labeling of the nuclear\nface was observed for any of the antibodies. The summary\nof the data collected for each of the three antibodies is\nshown in Table I.

Compared with the labeling for CAN\/Nup214,\nthe anti-Nup358 labeling generally resulted in a wider\ndata spread. These data indicate that RanBP2 but not\nCAN localizes to the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC,\nand suggest that the COOH terminus of RanBP2 is ori-\nented toward the cytoplasm.\n \nIn vivo decoration of cytoplasmic NPC filaments with \nRanBP2 antibodies does not prevent NLS-mediated \nnuclear import in \n \nXenopus\n \n oocytes\n \nAs a first approach to assess a possible involvement of the cy-\ntoplasmic filaments in nuclear protein import, we attempted\nto sterically occlude these filaments in vivo, and thus prevent\nthem from binding partner proteins. To this end, high con-\ncentrations of anti-Nup358V were injected into the cyto-\nplasm of living \n \nXenopus\n \n oocytes. These injections resulted in\nantibody sequestration at the cytoplasmic fibers bound either\nto NPCs or the pore complexes of the annulate lamellae (AL)\n(see below; Cordes et al., 1997a). At later time points, the\nsame cells were reinjected with transport substrates, incubated\nfurther, and finally analyzed for nuclear import.

No inhibitory effects on BSA-NLS im-\nport were observed (unpublished data; Cordes et al., 1997a).\nThese investigations did not rule out that some NPCs\nhad escaped immunoblocking and were still capable of\nRanBP2-mediated nuclear protein import.

Mock-depleted ex-\ntracts were not affected in mAb414-reactive nucleoporin\ncomposition (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2).\n \nCAN\/Nup214-deficient nuclei retain cytoplasmic \nfilaments and have a slight nuclear import defect\n \nCAN\/Nup214-depleted extracts supported efficient nuclear\nformation when combined with a membrane fraction, de-\nmembranated sperm chromatin, and an ATP regenerating\nsystem (Fig. 4, B.2 and C.2). As expected, no CAN\/Nup214\nwas detected at the nuclear rim of CAN-deficient nuclei (Fig.\n4, compare B.1 with A.1), whereas mAb414 staining ap-\npeared unaffected (Fig. 4, compare B.2 with A.2). Despite the\nabsence of CAN, RanBP2 localized normally at the NE (Fig.\n4, compare C.1 with D.1), consistent with localization of\nboth proteins at separate substructures of the NPC. High-res-\nolution FEISEM images of the cytoplasmic surface of CAN\/\nNup214 deficient NPCs showed that cytoplasmic filaments\nwere present (Fig. 4 E, arrows), further supporting the notion\nthat CAN\/Nup214 is not part of these substructures or re-\nquired for their formation. Internal structures were apparent\nbut difficult to resolve, and it was not possible to determine\nwhether there were any internal structural abnormalities.\nPreviously, genetic depletion of CAN\/Nup214 in early\nmouse embryos had been shown to result in an \n \n\u0002\n \n50% re-\nduced efficiency of nuclear import of a reporter NLS protein\n(van Deursen et al., 1996). Here we tested whether nuclear\nimport of an FITC-labeled nuclear import substrate, consist-\ning of 10 copies of the SV40 large T NLS crosslinked to BSA\nwas affected. As shown in Fig. 4 F, we detected a reduction of\nthe level of import of this substrate to \n \n\u0002\n \n75% of control levels.\n \nRanBP2\/Nup358-deficient nuclei lack cytoplasmic \nfilaments and import efficiently\n \nSimilar to CAN\/Nup214-deficient nuclei, RanBP2\/Nup358-\ndeficient nuclei formed efficiently from depleted extracts\n(Fig. 5, B.2\u2013E.2). No RanBP2 could be detected at the NE\nof these nuclei (Fig. 5 B.1), in contrast to the presence of\nRanBP2 in nuclei formed from mock-depleted extracts (Fig.\n5 A.1). In \n \nXenopus\n \n egg extracts, RanGAP1 is mainly present\nin its sumoylated form, a modification that targets the pro-\ntein to RanBP2 (Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1998),\nresulting in a nuclear rim localization (Fig. 5 D.1). Consis-\ntently, strong RanGAP1 labeling at the nuclear rim was\nfound in control nuclei, but was reduced in RanBP2-defi-\ncient NPCs (Fig. 5 D.2). In contrast, no reduction in stain-\ning intensity with mAb414 (Fig. 5 C.2) or anti-CAN (Fig. 5\nE.2) was apparent. Also, the level of anti-CAN immunogold\nlabeling in FEISEM analysis of these nuclei was not reduced\n(unpublished data).\nHigh-resolution FEISEM of the cytoplasmic face of the\nRanBP2-deficient nuclei showed that the NPCs (Fig. 5 G\nand G\n \n\u000b\n \n) were structurally different than the mock-depleted\ncontrols (Fig. 5, F and F\n \n\u000b\n \n), and that only the coaxial cyto-\nplasmic ring, but not the filaments, was still visible. How-\never, in the absence of cytoplasmic filaments, nuclear import\nof BSA-NLS (Fig. 5 H) or nucleoplasmin core M9 (unpub-\nlished data; see below) was not significantly affected (Fig. 5\nH). Nuclear import was signal dependent, as BSA coupled\nto a nonfunctional \u201creverse NLS\u201d peptide was excluded\nfrom RanBP2 deficient nuclei (see below).\nCAN\/Nup214- and RanBP2\/Nup358-deficient nuclei \nexhibit aberrant NPC morphology but show no further \nimport defect\nCombined CAN\/Nup214- and RanBP2\/Nup358-depleted\nnuclei also efficiently formed in the nuclear assembly\nreaction (Fig. 6, A\u2013D). As expected, both CAN and\nRanBP2 were absent from the double-deficient NEs (Fig.\n6, B and D), whereas mAb414 staining appeared only par-\ntially reduced (Fig. 6, compare A.1 and A.2 or C.1 and\nC.2). No reduction was detected in the staining for nucle-\noporins Tpr, Nup153, and Nup98 (Fig. 6 E). These nu-\ncleoporins are localized at the nuclear face of the NPC\n(Sukegawa and Blobel, 1993; Radu et al., 1995; Cordes et\nal., 1997b; Walther et al., 2001), and their presence indi-\ncates that the structure of the nuclear side of NPCs was\nnot affected. RanGAP1 staining (Fig. 6 E) was reduced to\na similar level as in the RanBP2 single-deficient nuclei\n(Fig. 5 D.2). No difference was detected in the levels of\nLamin LIII (Fig. 6 E), indicating that the CAN- and\nRanBP2-deficient nuclei were able to assemble a nuclear\nlamina. Nuclear growth that is suggested to be dependent\non a functional nuclear lamina (Meier et al., 1991; Spann\net al., 1997; Yang et al., 1997), also appeared normal as\nthe average size of mutant nuclei (diameter 14.8 \u0005 0.5\n\fm) was similar to control nuclei (15.6 \u0005 0.6 \fm).\nFEISEM imaging of the cytoplasmic surface of the dou-\nble-deficient nuclei revealed a striking structural NPC\nphenotype (Fig. 6 F and G). None of the NPCs visualized\nappeared completely assembled; instead, most had either\nonly a star ring or a cytoplasmic thin ring, which have\nbeen recognized as NPC assembly intermediates (Gold-\nberg et al., 1997). The tips of some of the star ring sub-\nunits appeared to be buried in the NE as previously de-\nscribed (Fig. 6 G, arrow).

Note that compared with\nthe multivalent BSA-NLS substrate (Fig. 7 A), nuclear im-\nport of the smaller, monovalent GFP-NLS import substrate\nin CAN- and RanBP2-deficient nuclei was less affected.\nSynthetic nuclei are able to initiate a single round of semi-\nconservative DNA replication (Blow and Laskey, 1986),\nwhich is dependent on their ability to concentrate factors for\nDNA replication (Walter et al., 1998). As a functional test\nfor import of natural cargos, we assayed incorporation of the\nthymidine analogue 21-biotin-dUTP into the DNA of nu-\nclei lacking CAN and RanBP2. As shown in Fig. 7 D, both\nmutant and control nuclei showed a similar level of diffuse\nnuclear staining with numerous bright foci. The majority of\nthis signal was absent when DNA polymerase \u0002 was inhib-\nited by aphidicolin (Fig. 7 D), indicating that the signal re-\nsulted from DNA replication. We conclude that in the ab-\nsence of CAN and RanBP2, nuclei are capable of normal\naccumulation of replication factors.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we assessed the function of the cytoplasmic\nNPC filaments in nuclear protein import. Previously, the\ncytoplasmic filaments have been implicated in protein im-\nport due to their colocalization with injected NLS\u2013gold con-\njugates, association with RanGTP and importin \u0003, by anti-\nbody inhibition experiments, and because of their potential\nto exclude macromolecules with no affinity for nucleoporins\n(Melchior et al., 1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995; Pante and\nAebi, 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Rutherford et al., 1997;\nYaseen and Blobel, 1999a; Rout et al., 2000).\nThe composition of the cytoplasmic filaments\nTwo proteins are commonly referred to as components of\nthe cytoplasmic filaments, RanBP2\/Nup358 and CAN\/\nNup214 (Ohno et al., 1998; Stoffler et al., 1999a; Allen et\nal., 2000). Our localization of CAN places it away from the\nfilaments, near the cytoplasmic entrance of the translocation\nchannel. This conclusion is derived from three observations.\nFirst, we have used a high resolution scanning immuno-EM\ntechnique that allows simultaneous visualization of the cyto-\nplasmic surface of the NPC and CAN\/Nup214-reactive im-\nmunogold labeling and thereby shown a localization of\nCAN close to the center of the NPC. Second, transmission\nimmuno-EM analysis shows labeling of CAN\/Nup214 at a\nposition close to the center of the NPC rather than a local-\nization at the cytoplasmic filaments. Third, immunodeple-\ntion of RanBP2\/Nup358 resulted in formation of NPCs\nlacking cytoplasmic filaments, yet CAN\/Nup214 remained\npresent on these NPCs. The immature phenotype of the cy-\ntoplasmic rings in NPCs codepleted for CAN and RanBP2,\nas compared with RanBP2-deficient ones, further argues for\na localization of CAN\/Nup214 near the cytoplasmic ring\nrather than on the filaments.\nIn two previous studies using TEM, it had been concluded\nthat Nup214 is a component of the cytoplasmic filaments\n(Kraemer et al., 1994; Pante et al., 1994). However, the im-\nages presented in one of these studies (Kraemer et al., 1994)\nrevealed a localization that is consistent with ours, using an\nantibody directed to a central domain of CAN. From the po-\nsition of the 11 gold particles presented in their study, a\nmean distance of 27 nm (\u0005 a standard deviation of 7) from\nthe midplane of the NE and 10 nm \u0005 7 from the center of\nthe NPC can be determined. These values lie within the\nspread, and even within the error of our localization data.\nThe second study, using a serum against full-length native\nrat protein, presented conclusive labeling of the cytoplasmic\nfilaments (Pante et al., 1994). Therefore, we cannot exclude\nthat the COOH-terminal part of CAN is localized in this\nposition. However, the specificity of the anti\u2013rat CAN\nantiserum for the Xenopus protein has not been reported.\nBiochemical identification of a nucleoporin subcomplex\ncontaining CAN\/Nup214 and p62 (Finlay et al., 1991; Mat-\nsuoka et al., 1999) is consistent with the localization of\nCAN\/Nup214 at the cytoplasmic face of the translocation\nchannel. p62 itself has been localized at both entrances of the\nNPC translocation channel using preembedding (Cordes et\nal., 1995; Guan et al., 1995) and postembedding immuno-\nTEM (Grote et al., 1995). Our study shows a CAN\/Nup214\nlocalization similar to the localization of Nup159\/Rat7\n(Kraemer et al., 1995; Rout et al., 2000), the closest yeast\nhomologue to vertebrate CAN\/Nup214, suggesting a greater\ndegree of functional conservation between these two nucle-\noporins than could earlier be assumed. The position of\nCAN\/Nup214 close to the translocation channel may allow\nits FG repeats to contribute to the hydrophobic FG repeat\nnetwork that is hypothesized to fill the translocation channel\n(Grote et al., 1995; Ribbeck and Gorlich, 2001).\nDecoration with two different antibodies localized\nRanBP2\/Nup358 on the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC,\nin agreement with previous studies (Wilken et al., 1995; Wu\net al., 1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995). Two additional lines of\nevidence suggest that RanBP2 is the major structural compo-\nnent of the cytoplasmic filaments. First, electron microscopic\nanalysis of purified RanBP2 shows particles with a filamen-\ntous shape and a length of \u000236 nm, which is both consistent\nwith the approximate size of the cytoplasmic filaments and\nthe length of RanBP2\u2019s amino acid sequence (Delphin et al.,\n1997). Second, depletion of RanBP2 leads to absence of fila-\nments from the cytoplasmic face of the NPC.\nThe use of the two antibodies raised against different re-\ngions of RanBP2 in the same study has allowed us to com-\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published July 8, 2002\nNPC filaments and nuclear import | Walther et al. 73\npare their localization relative to each other. The 358V anti-\nbodies recognize a small region corresponding to amino\nacids 2290\u20132314 of the human RanBP2 protein (Wu et al.,\n1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995), whereas the 358F antibodies\nrecognize a region closer to the COOH terminus and corre-\nspond to amino acids 2501\u20132900. Our data show that the\n358F epitopes are localized at a significantly more distal po-\nsition than the 358V epitopes, suggesting that the protein is\noriented with its COOH terminus pointing outward into\nthe cytoplasm. Consequently, its NH2 terminus, containing\npredicted coiled-coil and leucine zipper sequences (Wu et\nal., 1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995), may provide the interac-\ntion domains with the core NPC.\nRanBP2\/Nup358 is conserved among metazoa but absent\nin the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, it remains to\nbe determined whether yeast contains cytoplasmic filaments\nthat are functionally or structurally equivalent to those in\nmetazoa.\nThe cytoplasmic NPC filaments and nuclear import\nNuclei lacking CAN\/Nup214 showed a relatively minor,\n25% reduction in basic NLS-mediated protein import. Ear-\nlier studies in CAN \r\/\r mouse embryos showed a 50% re-\nduction in NLS protein import (van Deursen et al., 1996).\nEven though there is a difference in the degree of reduction\nbetween the two model systems, in both cases protein im-\nport is reduced but not eliminated. This is consistent with\nthe situation in yeast, where mutations in Nup159\/Rat7\nhave a limited effect on protein import (Del Priore et al.,\n1997; Belgareh et al., 1998; Hurwitz et al., 1998).\nMost surprisingly, our results show that removal of RanBP2\nand the complete cytoplasmic filaments affects neither NLS-\nor M9-mediated nuclear import, nor the exclusion of nonim-\nport cargos. This holds true for multivalent exogenous cargos,\nas well as for the endogenous cargos Lamin LIII (Hennekes et\nal., 1993; Lourim and Krohne, 1993), Tpr (Cordes et al.,\n1998), and factors required for DNA replication (Walter et\nal., 1998). Also, Nup153, an endogenous cargo for transpor-\ntin (Nakielny et al., 1999), was localized correctly. These re-\nsults indicate that the cytoplasmic filaments do not act as es-\nsential docking sites for incoming import complexes as had\nbeen suggested previously (Newmeyer and Forbes, 1988;\nRichardson et al., 1988; Akey and Goldfarb, 1989; Moore\nand Blobel, 1992; Melchior et al., 1995; Pante and Aebi,\n1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Rutherford et al., 1997), and the\nefficient exclusion of BSA\u2013SLN conjugate from depleted nu-\nclei suggests they are also not required for entropic exclusion\nof nonkaryophilic proteins (Rout et al., 2000).\nHow can this conclusion be reconciled with previous data\nlinking RanBP2 and the cytoplasmic filaments to an early\nstep in protein import? EM studies have observed NLS cargo\nassociation with cytoplasmic NPC filaments during normal\nimport (Newmeyer and Forbes, 1988; Richardson et al.,\n1988; Akey and Goldfarb, 1989), suggesting a temporal ar-\nrest. However, these studies have not addressed the necessity\nof these associations. A stronger indication that the cytoplas-\nmic filaments were directly involved in import was the accu-\nmulation of NLS cargos at the NE, or more specifically at the\nfilaments, under certain conditions including depletion of\nNTPs or Ran, addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine\nbinding lectin, or chilling to 4\u000eC (Dabauvalle et al., 1988;\nFeatherstone et al., 1988; Richardson et al., 1988; Moore\nand Blobel, 1992; Chi et al., 1996; Rutherford et al., 1997).\nAs argued previously (Englmeier et al., 1999), the perinuclear\naccumulation of classical NLS substrates observed under con-\nditions that deplete NTPs or Ran (Newmeyer et al., 1986;\nRichardson et al., 1988; Moore and Blobel, 1992; Melchior\net al., 1995) is likely the result of depletion of RanGTP that\nis needed to dissociate importin\u0002-\u0003\/cargo complexes from\nthe NPC (Rexach and Blobel, 1995; Gorlich et al., 1996).\nThis accumulation may block the translocation channel\n(Kutay et al., 1997). Chilling is likely to stabilize interactions\nof import complexes with NPC components, causing a simi-\nlar block of the NPC with endogenous cargos (Englmeier et\nal., 1999). Lectin or antibody binding to carbohydrate moi-\neties on some nucleoporins is also likely to arrest NPC trans-\nlocation. Therefore, the observed \u201cdocking\u201d of import com-\nplexes to the cytoplasmic filaments under these conditions\nmay be caused by obstruction of nucleoporin sites within the\nNPC that mediate the import reaction. By blocking these,\nimport complexes may associate or reassociate with sites that\nwould normally not contribute to the import reaction, but\nserve another function. In this regard it is noteworthy that\nthe FG repeats in RanBP2 are relatively sparse (Wu et al.,\n1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995), and have a low affinity for im-\nportin \u0003 (Ben-Efraim and Gerace, 2001). Alternatively, the\nassociation of import complexes with the filaments may func-\ntion to concentrate them in the vicinity of the core NPC, in-\ncreasing import efficiency (Rout et al., 2000; Ben-Efraim and\nGerace, 2001). However, we have not detected reduced im-\nport rates due to lack of RanBP2 or cytoplasmic filaments,\nwhereas we did detect a reduction in NLS-mediated import\ndue to depletion of CAN\/Nup214.\nThe association of Ran with the cytoplasmic filaments in\nthe presence of nonhydrolysable GTP analogs (Melchior et\nal., 1995), can be explained by binding of RanGTP to the\nRBD domains of RanBP2 and does not necessarily represent\nan early step of nuclear import. Transport induced bending\nof the cytoplasmic filaments, described as a mechanism for\nimport (Pante and Aebi, 1996; Rutherford et al., 1997) may\nbe caused by the multivalence of the transport substrates\nthat were employed in these studies. NLS-coated gold parti-\ncles are likely to interact with multiple copies of importin \u0003,\nenabling them to occasionally link FG repeats at the en-\ntrance of the translocation channel (e.g., those of CAN\/\nNup214 or p62), to those of RanBP2.\nPolyclonal antibodies raised against a GST-fused RanBP2\nfragment comprising two of the RanGTP binding domains\nplus several Zinc fingers and FG repeats inhibited nuclear\nimport of an NLS containing substrate (Yokoyama et al.,\n1995). Even though we cannot exclude that certain antibod-\nies to RanBP2\/Nup358 interfere specifically with NLS im-\nport, these antibodies also labeled the nuclear face of the\nNPC (Yokoyama et al., 1995), suggesting that they may\nhave crossreacted with other Zinc finger or FG repeat con-\ntaining nucleoporins such as Nup153 or p62.\nIn conclusion, our data argue against an essential role of the\ncytoplasmic NPC filaments in NLS and M9 dependent pro-\ntein import, and by default support translocation models that\ndo not involve them (Rexach and Blobel, 1995; Ben-Efraim\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published July 8, 2002\n74 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 158, Number 1, 2002\nand Gerace, 2001; Ribbeck and Gorlich, 2001). It remains\npossible that the cytoplasmic filaments are required for import\nof cargos not imported via the classical NLS- and M9-import\npathways, or for very large cargos, although the experiments\nin which we coated RanBP2 with colloidal gold-labeled anti-\nbodies without affecting the import of substrates of diameter\nbetween 10\u201316 nm would argue against the latter.\nIt is noteworthy that the cyclophilin-like domain of\nRanBP2 has been shown to interact with the 19S regulatory\nparticle of the 26S proteasome (Ferreira et al., 1998). The\n19S particle is known to have unfolding\/chaperone activity.\nSpecific binding to RanBP2 may indicate a demand for an\nunfolding activity at the cytoplasmic periphery of the NPC.\nAlthough such an activity seems unlikely to be required for\nNPC translocation it may serve some other function. A fur-\nther property of RanBP2 which may not be directly related\nto the actual nuclear translocation process is the recently\nidentified ability of RanBP2 to act as a SUMO-1 E3 ligase\n(Pichler et al., 2002). With the exception of RanGAP1 (Ma-\ntunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al.,\n1998) and RanBP2 itself (Pichler et al., 2002), all known\nsumoylated proteins are predominately nuclear (for review\nsee Muller et al., 2001). The association of import cargos\nwith the filaments therefore may represent a temporal trans-\nport arrest to allow modification of specific cargos, rather\nthan a general facilitating step in nuclear import.\nMaterials and methods\nAntibodies\nAnti-RanBP2 antibodies (358V) were raised in guinea pig against a peptide\ncorresponding to amino acids 2285\u20132314 of human RanBP2 (Wu et al.,\n1995; Yokoyama et al., 1995) of which aa 2290\u20132314 are identical to a\npartial sequence of RanBP2 from Xenopus laevis (GenBank\/EMBL\/DDBJ\naccession no. BG233383). The peptide was coupled via an NH2-terminal\ncysteine residue to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin and\nused for immunization as described (Cordes et al., 1997b). For affinity pu-\nrification of Igs, the peptide was coupled to Ultra Link Iodoacetyl on 3M\nEmphaze Biosupport Medium AB1 (Pierce Chemical Co.) and purified as\ndescribed (Cordes et al., 1997b). Antiserum 358F was provided by A. Gast\nand F. Melchior (Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Munich, Ger-\nmany). To generate specific antibodies against Xenopus CAN (anti-214) an\nNH2-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 1\u2013213 of the published se-\nquence (Askjaer et al., 1999) was expressed as a His6-tagged fusion pro-\ntein in pQE31 (QIAGEN) in XL1-Blue and purified under denaturing condi-\ntions. Antibodies were raised in rabbits and affinity purified against the\nantigen crosslinked to Affigel-15 (Biorad). To generate a resin for the de-\npletion from Xenopus egg extracts, saturating amounts of antibody were\nbound to protein A Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and\ncrosslinked with 10 mM dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma-Aldrich).\nPreparation of colloidal gold-coupled proteins\nCoupling to 5-nm colloidal gold, as well as preparation of BSA-SV40NLS\nconjugates and their coupling to 10-nm colloidal gold was performed essen-\ntially as described (Cordes et al., 1997a). To avoid overloads of protein\nwhich may result in subsequent leaching of bound material, Igs or BSA-\nSV40NLS were added to the gold particles at amounts just sufficient to main-\ntain colloidal stability upon addition of NaCl (Slot and Geuze, 1984). Re-\nmaining binding sites were blocked by incubating the gold suspension with\n0.1% BSA for 15 min before dilution in 20 vol of injection buffer (88 mM\nNaCl, 1 mM KCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). To remove the excess of unbound\nprotein, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 1 or 2 h, depending\non particle size. The supernatant and an occasionally observed minor solid\npellet consisting of coagulated gold were discarded, whereas the fluffy and\nvery loose major part of the sediment, containing the gold conjugates in col-\nloidal form, was resuspended in injection buffer and washed again. Follow-\ning final centrifugation, the loose sediment was collected as a concentrated,\nblack suspension and used either directly for injection or stored at 4\u000eC.\nMicroinjection and electron microscopy of \ninjected oocytes\nMicroinjections into the cytoplasm of nondefolliculated Xenopus stage VI\noocytes were performed at room temperature essentially as described\n(Cordes et al., 1997a). Four to six oocytes were injected for each experi-\nment. Injections of gold-coupled antibodies were done at two sites oppo-\nsite to each other at the equatorial borderline between animal and vegetal\nhemisphere. Injections of gold-coupled BSA-SV40NLS, or of gold-coupled\nBSA without NLS as control, were performed at a single site near the pole\nof the vegetal hemisphere. Oocytes were then incubated in modified\nBarth\u2019s medium at either 2\u000eC in the cold room or in a 19\u000eC incubator for 3,\n5, 8, 16, 22, or 30 h. For experiments in which antibody injections pre-\nceded the injection of gold-coupled BSA-SV40NLS, oocytes injected with\n5-nm gold anti-RanBP2, or mock-injected with buffer alone, were first in-\ncubated at 2\u000eC for 16 h. Following subsequent injection of 10-nm gold\nBSA-SV40NLS, oocytes were further incubated at 19\u000eC for 6 h. Oocytes\nwere then fixed in glutaraldehyde and processed for electron microscopy\nexactly as described (Cordes et al., 1997a).\nEM immunolocalization\nImmunolocalization of Nup214 and Nup358 on isolated Xenopus oocyte\nNEs using TEM and FEISEM was performed as previously described\n(Walther et al., 2001). For FEISEM analysis, antibodies were diluted 1:100\nwith PBS before being incubated with isolated Xenopus oocyte NEs. The\n214 and 358F primary antibodies were labeled with 10-nm gold-conju-\ngated anti\u2013rabbit secondary antibodies and the 358V antibody with 10-nm\ngold-conjugated anti\u2013guinea pig antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech),\nall at 1:20 dilution. Negative controls were performed and revealed the\nsecondary antibodies to be specific (unpublished data). Isolated NEs were\nvisualized at 100\u2013300 kx magnification. To quantify the immunolocaliza-\ntion, measurements were made using AnalySIS (SIS) software. For TEM\nquantification, the midplane of the NE (i.e., a line parallel to the NE and\nequidistant from both the inner and outer nuclear membranes) for each\nNPC was determined. The distances between the midplane of the NE and\nthe gold-labeled antibodies were measured at right angles to the midplane.\nFor quantification of the position of nucleoporins by FEISEM, the gold-\nlabeled antibodies were identified on the secondary electron image from\nthe corresponding backscatter image. Circles of best fit were placed over\neach NPC and each gold-labeled antibody, and the distances between the\ncenter of the NPCs and the center of the gold-labeled antibodies were\nmeasured.\nFEISEM analysis of depleted nuclei\nAfter nuclear assembly, 4 \fl of the assembly reaction was diluted with 1 ml\nMWB250 (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Hepes,\npH 8), and nuclei were spun down onto silicon chips at 800 g and fixed in\nmembrane fix (80 mM Pipes, pH 6.8; 1 mM MgCl2; 150 mM sucrose; 2%\nparaformaldehyde; 0.5% glutaraldehyde), for 30 min at room temperature.\nSamples were postfixed with 1% (wt\/vol) OsO4, 0.2 M cacodylate, pH 7.4,\nand 1% (wt\/vol) aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 min each, dehydrated\nthrough an ethanol series, and critical point dried from high purity CO2.\nSamples were sputter coated with 3 nm chromium and viewed using a Top-\ncon DS130F FEISEM (Topcon Corporation) at 30 kV accelerating voltage.\nNuclear assembly, import and replication assays, and\nindirect immunofluorescence\nFractionated egg extracts were prepared and depleted as described\n(Walther et al., 2001) except that the cytosolic fraction was depleted\nby two incubations with an equal volume of mock, anti-214, anti-\nRanBP2(358V), or a mixture of anti-214 and anti-RanBP2 resin, which was\npreblocked with 5% BSA for 1 h. Assembly, import, and immunofluores-\ncence reactions were performed as described (Hetzer et al., 2000). In brief,\nfor a 200-\fl reaction, 13.5 \fl cytosol, 1.5 \fl energy mix (10 mM ATP, 100\nmM creatine phosphate, 2 mg\/ml creatine kinase), 20 mg\/ml glycogen\n(USB; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were mixed. 1 \fl sperm chromatin\nfollowed by 2 \fl of membrane fraction were added and the reaction incu-\nbated for 2 h at 20\u000eC. For nuclear import reactions, a fluorescently labeled\nBSA-NLS conjugate (Palacios et al., 1996) or Nplc-M9-M10 (Englmeier et\nal., 1999) and an inert control substrate (BSA\u2013SLN) were added and further\nincubated for various times. The samples were subsequently fixed in 4%\nformaldehyde and centrifuged through a cushion of 30% (wt\/vol) sucrose\nonto an L-polylysine\u2013coated coverslip and either directly monitored by\nconfocal microscopy or further processed for immunofluorescence as de-\nscribed (Arts et al., 1997).
