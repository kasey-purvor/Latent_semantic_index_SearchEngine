The parts played by the women \nenabled the male managers to resolve tensions relating to discourses of \n\u2018rescue\u2019 associated with a Barnardo model of social work, and the \nrealities of the practical need of local boys for a place of  recreation more \nappropriate to club work. The Club minutes illustrate the association \nbetween middle class female power and the caring aspects of child rescue \nenshrined within social work. Resistance of local families to rescue \nafforded a place for working class female intervention but only if it \nremained invisible and under the protection of the middle class female \npresence. The story of the two women explains how institutional \nmasculine power was reasserted through a reconfiguration of practices \nand relationships. \n \n \n \n Introduction \n Between 1901 and 1904, two women became involved in the establishment of a \nnew Boys' Club in the East End of Sunderland. The accounts of the contributions of Mrs \nWinter who was employed as the club caretaker and Mrs Scurfield who was associated \nthrough the Charity Organisation Society (COS), are woven into the minutes of the \notherwise all-male weekly management committee meetings of the institution.[1]  The \nwidowed Mrs Winter lived above the club rooms in Lambton Street, while Mrs. Scurfield, \nmarried to Sunderland's Medical Officer of Health, lived in the new affluent area to the \nsouth of the town.[2]  They were not the only women associated with the club but their \ninterventions were unique insofar as they were regular and sustained,  and from their \ndifferent social positions, both occupied significant roles in the early life of the \norganisation.  \n \n 1\n The 'Sunderland Waifs' Rescue Agency and Street Vendors' Club'  was opened in \nJanuary 1902. Its purposes, as its name suggests, incorporated  both rescue and recreation, \nbut there was a common understanding amongst the sponsors informed by the example of \nBarnardo.  This can be discerned in the founding narrative which mirrors Barnardo\u2019s tale \nof his discovery of the homeless boy Jim Jarvis.[3]  In Sunderland, the story is told of a \nkindly local architect, Frank Caws, who discovered a ragged  boy asleep on the stairs of \nhis office one winter\u2019s evening.  Just as Barnardo founded his homes, it is claimed that \nCaws decided then and there to create a home and club for the  poor boys of Sunderland\u2019s \nstreets. [4] \n \n Despite narrative similarities [5] the Sunderland boy, Thomas A.[6] was not the \ndirect equivalent of  Jim Jarvis. Thomas A. had a home, however overcrowded, and a \nfamily, however poor, in Sunderland\u2019s east end tenements, where income was derived \nmainly from unskilled, casual labour market associated with the shipyards and building \ntrades. Families needed the extra few pence which could be earned by their children on \nthe streets, mainly as newspaper  sellers. Such children were highly visible and troubling \nin a generally prosperous and growing town, and the proposed institution addressed the \nproblem at a practical level.  Thus it was as a \u2018Street Vendors' Club\u2019 rather than a \u2018Waifs' \nRescue Agency\u2019 that the organisation was to become a popular facility. However, it was  \nthe discourse of  \u2018rescue\u2019, and of  \u2018child-saving\u2019[7] associated with Barnardo which \nprovided legitimation for the intervention. This discourse imagined boys as \u2018orphans\u2019 who \ncould find a \u2018home\u2019 in the club.  As one sponsor indicated at the opening ceremony, \u201cthey \nwould like to provide the lads with a comfortable home, to which they could come and be \nclothed and fed, and taught a good trade - to act as a sort of god-father towards them.\u201d[8]  \n 2\nThis gave Mrs. Winter a role within the club. It was but a short step from caretaker to that \nof  fulfilling traditional maternal responsibilities towards the boys  when the \u2018godfathers\u2019 \nwere not present.  \n \n The Barnardo narrative encouraged a deficit view of local families. If East End \nchildren were not actually the orphaned homeless, nevertheless, their street life suggested \na want of proper family care, control and training. This supplied the moral grounds for \nprivate as well as public interventions which again, was given shape at the opening event: \n\u201cCoun. Summerbell said a great deal had been said about clubs of that \nkind taking upon themselves the feeding and clothing of the children of \nthose people who had spent their money in drink, but they would be \ndoing a grand work if even they succeeded in tracing the drunken parents \nwho neglected and ill treated their children, and got them brought before \nthe magistrates. It was their duty however, if they desired to uplift the \ncommunity morally and socially, to at least rescue the lads from drifting \ninto a life of vice and crime.\u201d[9] \n \nIf sentimental Barnardo imagery could be applied to the innocent children of the \nstreets, this did not imply that negligent parents could be treated with similar sympathy. \nConcern for cruelty to children, influenced by the recently formed NSPCC [10] can be \ndiscerned in the intention to police families. This opened the door to a working \npartnership with the Charity Organisation Society and it was through this door that Mrs. \nScurfield walked.  \n \n 3\n Adherence to the principles of scientific charity advocated by the COS were a \nnecessary sign of respectability for any welfare organisation in this period[11] and in his \nopening speech, the chairman, Mr Thompson [12], was careful to reassure the public that:  \n\u201cOne of the dangers they would have to watch carefully would be that of \nimproperly relieving parents of their responsibility to their children. The \ncommittee, however, meant to be cautious in dealing with the problem \nthat lay before them, but they hoped to be able to bring a little sunshine \ninto the lives of the street vendors.\u201d[13] \n \nMrs. Scurfield, as a representative of the COS, took responsibility for home visits \nfrom which she would provide the information necessary for making informed decisions \nabout club members.   In doing so, she enabled the male sponsors to resolve the tension \nbetween the idea of the \u2018orphaned waif\u2019 and the reality of the family by relieving the men \nof the necessity of making direct contact with the families. Middle class women such as \nMrs. Scurfield had already established  their place in this field of  voluntary public work \nby the end of the nineteenth century [14] and as such it would not have been unusual to \nincorporate women in this capacity.   \n \n Thus the two women occupied positions in the organisation of the Waifs\u2019 Rescue \nAgency and Street Vendors\u2019 Club which were particularly associated with the feminine \nworld of caring, families and homes. Their participation was facilitated by the discourse of   \n\u2018rescue\u2019, which was initially dominant in providing the rationale for the venture. However, \nthe real relations which emerged as the institution adapted to its circumstances were to \nchallenge the grounds for their accommodation.  \n 4\n \n The possibility of resistance is not anticipated in the discourse of \u2018rescue\u2019 but the \nminutes suggest that whilst the club facilities were attractive, \u2018rescue\u2019 was not and local \nfamilies refused the designation of their children as \u2018waifs\u2019. However, there was no \ndiscourse of club work to match the public relations power of the Barnardo model of \nrescue. The Sunderland Club was not sponsored by any religious body or a settlement, and \nunlike most other boys\u2019 and girls clubs, it thus lacked a predetermined philosophical or \nmethodological  framework or a defined group of sponsors. It needed to appeal to the \nwidest cross section of  Sunderland wealth to attract support.   Russell and Rigby had yet \nto publish their influential text \u2018Clubs for Working Boys\u2019  [15] and \u2018youth work\u2019 as a \ncategory of welfare intervention was not a meaningful term. Public accountability was \ntherefore maintained through the romantic discourse of rescue, long after this cease to \nsignify practice in the Lambton Street Club. Not until 1936, when it affiliated with the \nNational Association of Boys\u2019 Clubs, did the name change to Lambton Street Boys\u2019 \nFellowship Centre, and as late as 1935 the Barnardo-influenced  \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 \nphotographs of  Thomas A.,  as a ragged child and later as a respectable, skilled man were \nbeing used to demonstrate the organisation\u2019s success [16]  \n \n The presence of Mrs. Winter and Mrs. Scurfield eased the tensions between the \nterms in which the work of the club was supported and the realities as they emerged in \npractice. The women\u2019s work enabled the male sponsors to reconcile competing motives of \nbenevolent paternalism and moralising authoritarianism. They also helped to mediate the \nvarious and conflicting interests of managers and members. Mrs. Winter facilitated \npositive relationships with local boys and their families, whilst Mrs. Scurfield ensured the \n 5\nrespectability of the venture amongst the affluent middle classes whose donations and \nmoral support could ensure its survival. Ultimately, the women also shouldered the burden \nof failures associated with \u2018waifs rescue\u2019 and \u2018social work\u2019, enabling the men to adjust \nmore easily to the development of Boys\u2019 Club work as a prototype of youth work practice.   \n \n Mrs Winter and Mrs Scurfield  acted as women in particular social locations, and it \nwas in terms of their structural identities that they were positioned in the foundation of an \norganisation which has survived for more than a century. A detailed reading of the club \nrecords provides an insight into the complexity of power relations within one organisation \nat a particular moment in place and time. This contributes to a more general appreciation \nof the manifestations of institutional inequalities which continue to resonate in \ncontemporary welfare organisations.  Specifically, the stories of these two women \nilluminate inequalities within British philanthropy at the start of the twentieth century and \ncapture a moment in the  process of differentiation and specialisation within social work. \nIn this process, developmental work with young people became separated from generic, \nfamily-focused social work, and this separation occurred along fault lines of gender and \nclass. As the twentieth century progressed, social work became increasingly identified \nwith women of the professional middle classes concerned with female competence in the \nfamily,  whilst work with young people became a semi-professional service dominated by \na workforce of respectable working class men concerned primarily with the problem of  \nadolescent boys in the public arena.  The dynamics of power involved in the creation of  \nthis division can begin to be discerned in the stories of these two women.    \n \n \n 6\nMrs Winter \n When the Lambton Street club opened in January 1902, Elizabeth Winter was \nalready living on the premises with her two children and a lodger. The building had \nrecently been occupied by four families but now hers was the only household remaining.  \nWith the opening of the club imminent, it was decided  \u201cMr. Caws to instruct Mrs Winter \nto remove her furniture into the Back Room on first floor and repair to room on Top Floor \ntill further arrangements can be made\u201d(23rd Dec. 1901).  Meanwhile, \u201cThe question of \nwhat terms to offer Mrs. Winter or whether to offer her the position of temporary \nCaretaker was discussed and deferred.\u201d  This suggests that the other residents had moved \nafter being offered  'terms', but that Mrs. Winter was not keen to leave her home. \nWhatever the circumstances, in the management meeting following the formal opening, it \nwas agreed that she should be employed as caretaker on three months trial \u201csubject to \ninterim alteration by the Committee if found necessary to open night shelter meanwhile.\u201d \nThe terms included wages of five shillings from which she was to buy her own soap, \ncloths and utensils, two rooms rent free, free coals and gas. She was also allowed to \n\u201cretain her respectable man lodger\u201d (2nd Jan. 1902).    \n \nShe was the first, and so far, the club's only employee, but there was no suggestion \nthat she should be involved in the work with the boys. The philanthropic ideal of \nvoluntarism implied that face to face work with the boys would be undertaken by club \nmanagers and supporters. As tenant and employee, Mrs. Winter was clearly situated \noutside the class of those who could entertain the possibilities of voluntary service. \nPerhaps there was benevolence in the decision to allow her to stay although conveniently \nthis also answered the practical need for a caretaker.  \n 7\n \n The debate which was soon to emerge around the engagement of a male worker \nimplies that some members of the committee might always have preferred a resident male \ncaretaker. Children needing care implicitly also needed training and discipline to set them \non the road to respectable adulthood and in the case of boys, controlled masculinity was \ncentral to this. Just one week after the opening, probably after encountering boisterous \nbehaviour, it was suggested that a male worker be employed as a \u201ccustodian\u201d for two \nhours per night. This occasioned some unease. The proposal was accepted in principle, but \n\u201cseveral members dissented\u201d, probably because the implied authoritarian strain jarred \nagainst the vision of homeliness and refuge from the streets. Homeliness could be \nprovided very simply by Mrs Winter as a paid caretaker. However her presence did not \nanswer the question of order and the idea of a male employee was pursued.  \n \n The possibility of employing a female custodian simply did not arise. Mrs Winter \nwas initially asked about the suitability of her lodger for the post. The problem could \nperhaps have been most satisfactorily resolved if it could have been kept in-house. But her \nresponse to these enquiries \u201cwas not entirely satisfactory\u201d (16th Jan. 1902). Given the \nusual power relations between housekeeper and lodger, it was highly unlikely that she \nwould have welcomed the prospect of these being disturbed by his employment in the \nclub as either an equal or a superior in status!  Meanwhile any male worker would surely \nhave represented a threat to her overall position as the person \u2018on site\u2019 and effectively in \ncharge of day to day activity.  \n \n Questions of discipline and order eventually became urgent  in the minds of some \ncommittee members. It was suggested that \u201can ex P.C.\u201d might be appropriate for the work \n 8\n(16th Jan. 1902) and  after advertising, the post was offered to a Mr. McLeod, whom it \nseems was associated with the police.[17]  McLeod's contract was to last, like Mrs. \nWinter\u2019s, until the end of March 1902.  \n \n With McLeod in place during the week, voluntary work became supplementary \nrather than central, although individual managers continued to undertake informal \nresponsibilities, such as meeting boys to take them to prospective employers.  In addition, \nFrank Caws was now able to open the club on Sundays for an ecumenical Christian \nmeeting. Mrs Winter and her 17 year old daughter both attended these \u201cPleasant Sunday \nevenings\u201d (20th March 1902), signifying her personal commitment to the work of the \nclub, and incidentally her loyalty to Caws.  McLeod on the other hand was absent. \n \n Indeed, there is no mention of McLeod in the minutes until one Committee \nmember reported that the man was not popular with the boys (13th March 1902) \nwhereupon others related that members of the Ladies\u2019 Committee, including Mrs. \nScurfield, had privately communicated similar information. Probably the following story, \nrecounted by Caws to the Sunderland Watch Committee during a discussion about \nplaygrounds refers to McLeod  and the cause of his unpopularity: \n \n\u201cThey had good reasons as to why the boys didn't make use of the \nplaygrounds. Policemen were put there to keep order. They had had a \nlittle experience of that in Lambton Street. They had a policeman in plain \nclothes when they opened the place to keep order. In a sense, the \npoliceman stood like a pillar. There were open spaces all around. \n(Laughter.) These spaces widened and widened, until it was all space and \n 9\nno boy. (Renewed laughter.) The time came when they disengaged the \npoliceman. No sooner had he gone than the boys began to troop back in \nagain.\u201d [18]  \n \n \nIn the face of the difficulties, it was decided not to renew McLeod\u2019s contract at the end of \nMarch 1902.  Simultaneously, we find the first intimation that Mrs. Winter was becoming \nmore than a  'caretaker' when she reported that she had sent home two boys who had \nmeasles in their family. Already she was adopting the responsibilities envisioned as \nbelonging to the  custodian (20th March 1902).  \n \n The willingness of the management committee to allow Mrs Winter to take charge \nof everyday practicalities gave her personal status and credibility as a representative of the \norganisation. As a local resident, she knew the neighbourhood. Thus she could learn very \nquickly for instance, if there were infectious disease in a family, and though her position \nin the new club might be a humble one, she felt able to exercise some authority on its \nbehalf. In the measles case, in confirming her decision and in asking her to ensure that the \nchildren did not return for an appropriate period, the committee implicitly began to \nformalise the authority which she assumed at the very moment when her contract was due \nto end.  \n \n There was no minuted discussion about whether or not Mrs. Winter's contract \nshould be extended. Instead, she appears to have simply been allowed to take McLeod's \nplace. Afterwards, on a motion put forward by Caws, it was agreed to pay her an extra two \nshillings and six pence per week for as long as she was \u201casked to superintend the boys\u201d \n 10\n(10th April 1902). For half the price of a man, the committee could employ a woman who \nwas clearly able to undertake the practical work required much more successfully than the \nprevious incumbent.  Mrs. Winter moved from being simply a caretaker, to caretaker and \nsuperintendent, the title of  \u201ccustodian\u201d meanwhile having been abandoned. The job she \nwas doing, involving as it did her personal location, the interpersonal relationships of \nneighbourhood and her maternal approach, was proving to be an important element in the \nability of the club to win the loyalty and support of local boys. She was the vehicle \nthrough which personal and private information could be translated into public action. Yet \ndespite the formal practical acceptance of her club duties, the basis of her influence, lying \nwithin the informal and the private realms, was fundamentally insecure. She could not \nafford to relax. \n \n Almost immediately she had undertaken superintendent duties, the question of \norder was raised:  \n\u201cMessrs. Kirby and Brewer reported an act of insubordination by one of \nthe Club Boys in consequence of which they had temporarily expelled \nhim last Friday evening. They argued that a male attendant was \nnecessary in place of Mr McLeod to preserve order\u201d (17th April 1902). \n \n Why the \u201cact of insubordination\u201d should be translated in gender terms, why it \nshould have necessitated a male worker and by implication be held against Mrs. Winter, is \nnot explained by the two offended committee members, but luckily for her:  \n\u201cMr. Cameron, Mr. Summerbell and others thought in prospect of the \nSummer months it would not be wise to make such an appointment \n 11\nespecially as the case reported was the only case of disorder yet \ncomplained of since Mr McLeod left. It was decided to do nothing in this \nmatter at present\u201d (17th April 1902). \n \n Again, practical considerations triumphed and for the summer of 1902, Mrs. \nWinter's position seemed secure; the matter of order was not raised again. The silence \nimplies her success. By May, it was reported that the boys were beginning to deposit their \nsavings with her and the Committee formalised this private arrangement by appointing \none of its members as Savings Bank Secretary (22nd May 1902), thus creating a public \nscheme for which the Committee took final responsibility, and incidentally, removing it \nfrom working class, female control. In September, so pleased were the managers with \nwhat had been accomplished, that when Caws proposed that Mrs Winter's wage be \nincreased by two shillings and sixpence, the equivalent of that which had been paid to \nMcLeod, there was not a murmur of dissent (18th Sept. 1902). Mrs. Winter must have \nbegun to feel that she was an important employee. Yet in reality her status was anything \nbut secure. During that summer, the minutes record for the first time the presence of the \nman who was ultimately to replace her: \u201cThe insufficiency of space for the Drill Class \nconducted by Mr Smith was reported, and it was resolved that the question of improved \nspace shall claim priority of other business at next Committee Meeting\u201d (28th Aug. 1902). \n \n Notably, Smith had begun working with the boys in organised groups, pursing an \nactivities-based agenda which was both attractive to the boys and matched well the ideas \nof discipline, order and manliness which were central features of the emergent, \nrecreational, Boys\u2019 Club movement. [19]  \n 12\n \n In the meantime, Mrs Winter focused upon personal and caring tasks. For \nexample, in October 1902, she escorted William F., a disabled boy, to Newcastle, to meet \nan agent who would take him to Barnardo's home in Stepney.  On the recommendation of \nthe club, William's parents had given permission for him to leave Sunderland in \nanticipation of his being trained as a tailor (9th Oct. 1902). Later, when William wrote to \nthe club to report on his progress and asking if he might come home for Christmas, (a \nrequest refused), it was to Mrs. Winter that he addressed his letter (30th Oct. 1902).[20] \n \nThis was but the first of a number of situations recorded in which decisions \nrelating to the welfare of individual boys were effected through Mrs. Winter. When boys \nwere found work outside of the district, it was she who escorted them either directly to the \nplace of work or to the railway station (eg. 23rd. Oct. 1902) and it was she who received \nthe reports of their safe arrival (or otherwise).  When boys needed to be clothed decently \nin order to start a new job, it was usually Mrs. Winter who fitted them out (eg. 14th Aug. \n1902). When two boys left their jobs, \u201cMrs Winter was called in and narrated to the \ncommittee some particulars of these cases\u201d (30th Oct. 1902). The managers could \ndiscover details about the boys through Mrs. Winter which would otherwise have been \nunavailable to them.  When two boys who had tramped to Sunderland from Scotland \nturned up on the Lambton Street doorstep, it was Mrs. Winter who took them in and who \nwas requested by the committee to give them board and lodging until such time as they \ncould be sent to employment. In the case of another who arrived from Glasgow, Mrs. \nWinter simply took it upon herself to send him immediately, along with a local boy, to \nemployment in the glass works in Seaham, six miles down the coast. The committee did \n 13\nnot demur (23rd Oct. 1902). The role Mrs. Winter adopted aided the relationship building \nwhich was a necessary aspect of establishing the credibility of the club as a \u2018caring\u2019 \ninstitution in the neighbourhood. \n \n A practical working pattern was being created which suited all parties and which \nmost importantly, was reflected in the popularity of club membership. Acknowledgement \nof Mrs. Winter's contribution was publicly offered in the first annual general meeting of \nFebruary 1903: \n \n \u201cAld. G. B. Hunter JP  [21] then moved \n 'that the Retiring Ctee. & Officers to be thanked for their Services' He \nmentioned these in detail  & also remarked on the excellent service of \nMrs Winter (the caretaker) who had been like a mother to the Boys. \n Mr Herbert Corder seconded.\u201d [22]    \n \nAlthough her formal title remained that of Caretaker, Mrs Winter established herself in \npractice as the first resident superintendent and youth worker of the Lambton Street Club. \nNevertheless, her inability to gain the title of  'superintendent', and its displacement with \nthe notion of mothering, despite the de facto acceptance of her duties, was not \ninsignificant.  \n \n In early 1903 Mrs. Winter's position seemed relatively secure.  However, there had \nalready been one note of concern about her work which related to her giving too much \nleeway to the boys especially in the matter of payment for club services. So for instance, \nhaving obtained the permission of the committee to provide the boys with cocoa at \u00bdd per \n 14\ncup (4th Dec. 1902), and coffee and biscuits (11th Dec. 1902) she was later rebuked for \nnot charging some of them. Her action provoked   \n\u201ca heated discussion...about the immorality of the indiscriminate giving \nof Refreshments to the boys attending the Club. The C'tee wished it to be \ndistinctly understood that before cocoa to be provided gratis for a number \nof the boys connected with the club (on the premises) the matter should \nbe brought before them\u201d (22nd Jan. 1903).  \n \nThe following week, \u201cMrs Winter was instructed that no refreshments be provided \ngratis for the boys in large numbers\u201d (29th Jan. 1903).  Similarly, maybe because of her \nsympathy for the circumstances of the boys, she seems to have allowed many of them to \nattend the club despite their failure to pay their 1d per month membership dues. When she \nwas instructed to tighten up on this, as with the matter of the refreshments, she complied \nwithout question (2nd April 1903). Mrs. Winter was scrupulous in attempting to carry out \nthe policies and decisions of the managers. However she was unclear about the invisible \nboundaries created by their philosophy of welfare.  \n \n Mrs Winter was probably emboldened in her interventions by the pragmatic \napproach of Frank Caws, and the everyday working relationship which she created with \nhim.  She seems to have understood  the significance of his personal power as Club \nfounder and Hon. Secretary, and actively maintained her alliance with him.  However, she \nwas shielded from a direct encounter with the real power relations operating at committee \nlevel by the charisma and influence of Caws on the one hand, and her own exclusion from \nformal decision-making processes on the other. Clearly she was not fully informed about \n 15\nthe principles or the underlying tensions guiding the decisions of the Committee.  It was \ninevitable that, as she began to feel more secure, she would be more likely to take \nindependent decisions over what must have seem fairly small matters which simply \nextended the personal, caring role which the committee seemed to endorse, and in so \ndoing, to transgress.  \n \n The recorded transgressions were probably not in themselves of sufficient \nimportance to undermine Mrs. Winter. What was of more significance, and what she \ncould hardly have seen from her own perspective, was that in interpersonal terms the \npower of  Mrs. Scurfield was just as significant in affirming and protecting her role as the \npower of Caws. While Caws exerted a personal and charismatic power over decision \nmaking [23], Mrs. Scurfield occupied a structurally significant position in which theory \nand practice could be reconciled without disturbing the mainstream work of the club. Mrs. \nScurfield\u2019s presence provided an umbrella under which both Mrs Winter and indeed, \nCaws,  could operate relatively freely. In the absence of Mrs Scurfield the power of  Caws \nwas  weakened and the position of Mrs. Winter became unsustainable.   \n \nMrs Scurfield \n Mrs. Scurfield was present as a visitor at the formal opening of the club in January \n1902 and attended her last meeting in December 1903 prior to moving to Sheffield,  when \nthe committee presented her with \u201csix handsomely bound volumes of Rudyard Kipling's \nPoems as a token of their regret at losing her services\u201d (17th Dec. 1903). Those services \nhad been largely those of a Lady Visitor, investigating the conditions in the homes of club \nmembers.   \n 16\n \n Prior to the club opening, Mrs Scurfield had indicated her willingness to undertake \ninvestigative work and afterwards she offered to create a \u201cLadies\u2019 Committee of \nInvestigation.\u201d Later at a special meeting of  \u201cwould be helpers\u201d  four additional women \nand one minister, volunteered their services \u201cto investigate cases.\u201d At this meeting (24th \nJan. 1902), Mrs. Scurfield offered \u201cto attend the rooms\u201d every other Thursday evening. \nShe also agreed to \u201cform a Ladies Commee. of helpers and to report progress.\u201d She then \nproceeded to take the names of the boys present in the club that night with a view to \nvisiting their homes.  There was no clarification at this stage of what \u2018investigation\u2019 \nimplied and  the idea seems simply to have been to gather information and evidence which \nwould enable the work to be focused more effectively. No doubt, such information would \nalso have been of some interest in the Scurfield household for as medical officer for \nhealth, it was Dr. Scurfield's duty to report to the local authority the sanitary conditions of \nthe houses in this area of the town.[24] Mrs Scurfield's enthusiasm for the work must \nsurely be read in this context.  \n \n Apart from the representation of Mrs. Scurfield, there are no surviving records of \nthe activities of other investigators or of the Ladies Committee. Only an occasional \nglimpse of  formally organised work by women can be discerned, eg. \u201cThe committee \ndecided that at the next monthly meeting of the Executive a vote of thanks to the Ladies\u2019 \ncommittee, and specially to Mrs Scurfield, should be proposed, for their invaluable \nservices to the club\u201d (13th March 1902).  Their role in the demise of  McLeod suggests \nthat it was mainly through informal channels that the opinions and observations of women \nwere given voice. Their activities, which  included helping  with \u201cPleasant Sundays\u201d and \n 17\non special occasions,  were occasional and  irregular. Mrs. Scurfield alone seems to have \nsingle-mindedly pursued the responsibilities associated with family visiting and she \nreported only the results of her own investigations.  \n \n It appears that  Mrs Scurfield associated herself with the Ladies\u2019 Committee \nprimarily as a means of facilitating her personal access, and by extension, that of the \nCharity Organisation Society, to the affairs of the Lambton Street club and the homes of \nthe boys. It was only because she represented the Ladies\u2019 Committee that she was able to \nattend the management committee meetings. It would have been difficult for her to have \ngained personal access as a woman to a male venture. Neither could she have done so as a \nrepresentative of the COS, because the management of Lambton Street was composed \nentirely of independent individuals. However the moral charitable framework within \nwhich the Waifs\u2019 Rescue Agency and Street Vendors\u2019 Club was constituted  provided the \nrationale for the Ladies Committee and for the investigative visits which she proposed.   \n \n It was not until April 1902 that Mrs Scurfield attended a Management Committee \nmeeting.  Probably she organised and attended Ladies\u2019 Committee meetings in the first \nmonths. Otherwise, the records indicate that she concentrated upon visiting,  reporting the \ncircumstances of particular boys and consulting formally with the COS.  In  February \n1902, the cases of two families, including the McM.s \u201cwere discussed and left for further \ninquiry.\u201d Then, one week later:  \n\u201cA letter from the Charity Organisation Society's Official to Mrs. \nScurfield about the McM. family was read. The Secretaries were \ninstructed to write Mrs Scurfield that the committee consider the two \n 18\nlittle McM. boys fit subjects for removal to Dr Barnardo\u2019s Institution if \nMrs Scurfield can obtain the requisite consent of the parents\u201d (20th Feb. \n1902). \n \n She did not obtain the requisite consent because the following week, \u201cMrs \nScurfield reported through Mr Kirby as to the case of the McM\u2019s. On the motion of Mr \nPerris seconded by Mr Summerbell it was resolved to notify the School board of the non-\nattendance at school of the two little McM\u2019s.\u201d (27th Feb. 1902). \n \n This case was to set the tone for Mrs Scurfield\u2019s interventions. Her principle \npurpose in communicating with the Management Committee was to provide information \nabout the family circumstances of individual boys. Her preferred vehicle of \ncommunication was either a written or verbal report delivered by one of the men.  She did \nnot presume to intervene otherwise. At the first meeting she attended, \u201con behalf of the \nLadies Committee\u201d the minutes imply that she did not speak at all: \n \n \u201cA letter from Mrs Scurfield gave particulars of the cases of Joseph C. \nand Thomas McK. and George T. \n It was pointed out that Joseph C. had found employment at Mesrs J.L. \nThompson & Sons Shipyard. \n The case of Thomas McK. was still under consideration - also that of \nGeorge T.  \n Subsequently Mrs. Scurfield handed in a supplementary report as to \nThomas T. - and the Secretary was instructed to ask Mr Cowan if he \ncould obtain him work at the Co-operative Store\u201d (3rd April 1902).  \n 19\n \nThe following week, Mrs. Scurfield was absent and the minutes simply record \u201cLadies \nCommee Report read.\u201d  However, in the case of George T. whom she had been \ninvestigating,  \u201cPending the Father's consent to the proposed emigration the Case of the \nBoy George T. is postponed: or until it can otherwise be dealt with\u201d (10th April 1902). \n \n No further mention of George T. suggests that as with the McM. brothers, no \npermission was granted to enable the Lambton Street Club to effect a plan of rescue. The \npattern was to be repeated throughout the whole of Mrs. Scurfield\u2019s time with the club. At \nthe next meeting which she attended, in June 1902, it was agreed \u201cthat Mrs Scurfield be \nasked to approach Mr. Coley of the Charity Organisation Society and induce him to ask \nMr Wilkinson to try and get Dr. Barnardo to take M. and train him\u201d (12th June 1902) but \nhaving visited the home, Mrs Scurfield was obliged to report that \u201cMrs M. refused to part \nwith her boy or allow Committee to do anything for her boys\u201d (19th June 1902). \n \n Except in exceptional circumstances, like that of the boy William F. who was \ndisabled, the parents of club members were resolutely resistant to any active interference \nin their affairs. When a rumour circulated that \u201cthe boys were all to be sent to Canada\u201d, \nmost of them simply stayed away (13th March 1902). In the continuing case of Thomas K. \nwhose mother Mrs. Scurfield found to be \u201ca most deserving hard working widow with \nhome in excellent order though in a very bad neighbourhood,\u201d  it was suggested that the \nwhole family - mother, daughter and son, be moved to Seaham and Mrs. Scurfield ensured \nthat work was available for both children in the bottleworks there.  Mrs. K. was given a \nweek to think it over. Again, the outcome is not reported, but the decision to provide Tom \nK. with a jersey at the end of the following January suggests that the offer  \u201cto make a \n 20\nhome in Seaham under better circumstances and surroundings\u201d was declined (4th-18th \nDec. 1902; 29th Jan. 1903).   \n \n The unwillingness of local families, and especially mothers,  to co-operate with the \ndesigns upon their lives continuously frustrated the aspiration towards \u2018Waifs\u2019 Rescue\u2019 \nand Mrs. Scurfield\u2019s industrious efforts towards this end were of no avail. However, the \nauthoritative evidence gleaned from her visits balanced the more personal, informal \nknowledge emanating from Mrs. Winter. Her work was therefore of value in enabling the \ncommittee to make evidence-based decisions regarding individual boys. In particular, \nMrs. Scurfield\u2019s reports enabled them to put into effect a clothing scheme without fear \nthat they would be accused of  indiscriminate support for undeserving families.  \n \n Many Lambton Street club members were noticeably ill clad in a period when \nclothing was a major expense in any budget and a scarce resource for those without \nsurplus. Surviving photographs which show the boys barefoot and ragged are indicative of \ntheir poverty. [25] Particularly in the winter, the committee men expressed compassionate \nconcern, but clothing also played a crucial part in their desire to facilitate access to steady  \nand regular work for their members. It was believed that the inconsistency and insecurity \nof casual  labour lay at the root of the problem of poverty. A regular income,  preferably \nderived from skilled labour was the route to order and respectability.[26]  But boys who \nwere not dressed respectably could not hope to be offered regular employment.  \n \n Providing deserving boys with decent clothing was  an implicit but essential plank \nof the strategy to save them from reproducing the poverty of their parents.  By April of the \nfirst year, without prior minuted discussion, the managers simply agreed to seek \n 21\ninformation from the police in Liverpool and Manchester about the clothing schemes \noperating in those cities. On receipt of the replies, it was agreed \u201cthat these be handed to \nMrs. Scurfield for her study and that of the Ladies committee who were to be expressly \ninvited to join the executive Committee at their next meeting\u201d (28th May 1902). There is \nno record of any Ladies other than Mrs. Scurfield attending the meeting to discuss the \nscheme, and significantly, at this meeting, as the first item on the agenda, it was \nunanimously agreed that she be elected as an individual member of the committee. \n \n Voting Mrs. Scurfield onto the committee was an indication of the importance \nwhich the men attached to the clothing scheme and its proper administration. It suggested \nthat as a full member of the Committee, she could take primary responsibility  in this \nmatter. Her investigative visiting  would inform decision making. The men seem to have \nsimply assumed that the practical application of the scheme would be undertaken by the \nLadies\u2019 Committee. \n  \nHowever, in reality, the person who was most active in the face to face work with \nthe boys was Mrs. Winter. She alone was in a practical position to fit out the boys and as \ncaretaker, to manage the store of clothes held by the club.  Thus it was in relation to the \nquintessentially feminine arena of clothing children that the work of Mrs Scurfield and \nMrs Winter was to overlap. And it was in this arena that the tensions and contradictions \ninherent in their position were to come to a head.  \n \nClothing \n To have allocated clothing simply on the basis of need would have flouted the \nprinciples of charitable giving. Moreover, all the boys were needy. The Clothing Scheme \n 22\nallowed for boys to be kitted out for work and for younger boys to be given garments in \nresponse to need after a satisfactory report from Mrs. Scurfield. Thus the Committee \nsought to maintain control over their giving, but this was thwarted by the responses of the \nboys and their families.   \n \nIn the first recorded case of clothing being offered,  \n\u201cThe boy Michael P. (No. 74) attended before Committee and engaged to \nenter the Smithy at Brewers Yard as kindly offered by Mr Cowan at 6 \nshillings per week. Mrs Scurfield was commissioned to obtain the \nneedful clothing for Michael P's outfit: so that he may commence his new \nduties next Monday Morning at 9 o'clock\u201d (19th July 1902).  \n \nMichael P. left this job in less than a week complaining \u201cthat he had been made to wield \ntoo heavy a hammer.\u201d He could neither be persuaded to go back to work not to return the \nclothing and \u201cMr Caws was instructed to reprimand him before giving him his ticket for \nthe picnic\u201d planned as a club treat (7th Aug. 1902).  \n \n During a period of absence of Mrs. Scurfield, Mrs. Winter under instruction from \nthe committee clothed an unamed  boy for work. Within a week he had taken an \nalternative job.  At least he was still working. Thomas H. on the other hand, \u201cafter being \nfitted out with clothing and working some short while at the Blacksmiths work under Mr \nCowan had given up the job and returned to Street Vending\u201d (14th Aug.1902).  \n  \nThe pattern was to be given a further twist in the case of  Tom C. whose family \n 23\nalready owed the Committee three shillings. This had been given to them by  Caws via \nMrs Winter \u201cas an inducement to allow their son to return to his work\u201d: \n\u201cMr Caws reported that C. had been fitted out with one suit of clothes by \nMrs Winter and he, (Mr Caws) believed, but was not sure, also with \nanother suit of clothes by Messrs Candlish. \n The Committee after hearing Mr Caws explanation decided to allow the \ncost of  clothes supplied by Mrs Winter\u201d (6th Nov. 1902).  \n \nIn this case, Mrs Winter and Caws had clearly  exceeded the authority granted them by the \ncommittee. Sensing criticism, Caws explained that the formal clothing scheme had not yet \nbeen put into operation. In response, \u201cHe was instructed to get the printed forms forthwith \ncompleted, and on the motion of Mr Kirby seconded by Mr Cockshott it was resolved that \nthe Clothing Scheme rules be henceforth adhered to\u201d (6th Nov. 1902). Meanwhile the \ncommittee would attempt to recover the clothing as well as the three shillings. What \nfollowed is recorded the following week: \n \n\u201cMr Charlton who was unable to attend reported per Mr Caws, the result \nof his call on Mrs C, who had returned 1 shilling of the 3 shillings as a \nfirst installment. Mrs Winter stated that Mrs Coggins had demanded the \nreturn of T's shirt failing which she would stop off 1 shilling from the \ntwo shillings balance yet unreturned. Mrs Winter stated that the old shirt \nwas a rag and had disappeared, she having fitted the boy out with a new \nshirt instead. Mr Charlton reported that the boy's father seemed a \nreasonable man, but the mother unreasonable\u201d  (13th Nov. 1902). \n 24\n \nThe patience of the Committee started to pall. When later in the meeting, the needs of \nanother boy for clothing in relation to work was raised: \u201cthe committee accordingly \ninstructed Mr Caws to get Mrs Winter to supply the boy with a decent outfit, and obtain \nproper written acknowledgement from his mother, the clothing in this case to be stamped \nby the police.\u201d  \n \nThese difficulties were experienced in Mrs. Scurfield\u2019s absence. When she next \nattended a meeting, (4th Dec. 1902) she and the Ladies' Committee, in co-operation with \nthe Chairman, were expressly given the power to deal with clothes.  With Mrs. Scurfield \nfronting it, the clothing scheme ran smoothly. Throughout that winter, Mrs. Scurfield \nvisited homes and made recommendations which were never questioned. Her reports \nenabled clothing to be provided fairly generally to boys in need.  Once the committee had \nformally agreed to the provision of specific garments, Mrs. Scurfield seems to have been \nleft to implement the decisions. The unspoken assumption was that this would be effected \nby the Ladies\u2019 committee, but in practice Mrs. Winter undertook this task.  \n \n As it became known that clothes might be obtained from the club, boys and their \nparents began to actively apply for help. The first application came via Mrs. Winter, \u201cThe \ncommittee having through Mrs Winter heard the application of Mrs R. for boots for James \nR. decided to grant the application, on the usual terms\u201d (19th Feb. 1903).  \n \n With the next application they were less generous and instead of offering clothes,  \nsent Mrs Scurfield to visit the home of the boys concerned. When she reported upon \u201cthe \nmiserable condition of things there\u201d (23rd April 1903), one of the committee members \n 25\noffered to find labouring work for the men of the family. No clothes were provided. This \ndecision marked a tightening of control in relation to those who should be so bold as to \nask for clothing, especially when the request had come made through Mrs. Winter.  \n \n Despite the diligence of the managers and the best efforts of Mrs Scurfield,  the \nboys and their families continuously flouted the system. Firstly, despite being clothed \ndecently for work, boys remained inconstant in relation to employment.[27] They left \ntheir jobs and kept the clothes.  Secondly, some boys joined the club, and left as soon as \nthey had procured clothing. Thirdly, some items of clothing disappeared, probably \npawned, once they had been allocated. Irregularities in the system were becoming so \ncommon that by May 1903, Mrs. Winter was requested \u201cto inspect every Thursday night \nthe boys who have received clothing from the Club and to report on same to committee if \nand as necessary.\u201d But there were few sanctions that could be imposed other than that of \ndisallowing membership or participation in special events, and they did not wish to lose \nmembers.  \n \n The inability to enforce the terms of the clothing scheme was frustrating, but while  \nMrs. Scurfield was involved, management committee members were secure in the \nknowledge that they were operating a system which was at least designed to limit abuse \nand which could be publicly defended. However, in October 1903, just as the needy \nperiod of winter was approaching, Mrs. Scurfield indicated that she was leaving \nSunderland. By this time, Mrs. Winter was much more involved in the practical \nadministration of the scheme, and as Mrs. Scurfield withdrew, Mrs. Winter began \nrepresenting to the Committee the needs of the boys:   \n 26\n \n\u201cMrs Winter reported that (216) George W. was an applicant for \nclothing. She advised that he be supplied with 1 pair of trousers, 1 jacket \nand vest, 1 pair shoes, some of the articles she has in stock being suitable. \nThe boy was called upon before committee and appeared not so ill clad \nafter all. But Mrs Winter explained that he was in borrowed clothes. The \ncommittee instructed the Hon. Sec. to apply through Mrs Scurfield for \ninformation from the Charity Organisation Society as to this boy's case\u201d \n(1st Oct. 1903). \n \nMrs. Winter\u2019s recommendation was not taken at face value, but when the COS \nreport demonstrated the accuracy of her recommendation, some members of the \ncommittee considered that she might be given more responsibility: \n\u201cOn the motion of Mr Cockshott seconded by Mr Caws it was agreed that \nthe clothes now in possession of the institution should be distributed to \nthe most suitable cases upon the recommendation of Mrs Winter \n[inserted later: -subject to the approval of the Committee]. Mrs Winter \nwas called in and requested to report next week as to the best disposition \nof the clothing and was informed that boys in regular work might offer \nnominal sums by way of purchase if they thought fit but [inserted later:-\nparents of] boys who could pay nothing should sign the usual form of \nreceipt. The question of whether boys who pay should sign that form \nstands over for further consideration\u201d (5th Nov. 1903).  \n \nHad this motion stood, Mrs. Winter would have gained a degree of authority,  enabling the \n 27\nclub to respond directly to boys\u2019 needs. But two weeks later the minute was rescinded and \nthe decision taken to investigate cases recommended by Mrs. Winter in the \u2018regular\u2019 \nmanner.  Moreover, Mrs Winter seems to have exceeded her authority, for the minutes \nlater record: \n \n\u201cThe Hon. Sec. Reported that he had sent Mrs Scurfield the list of boys \nrecommended by Mrs Winter for gifts of clothing, in order that she might \nmake the visits or inquiries needed to satisfy the committee. \n With reference to the case of Mrs Winter full discussion having taken \nplace it was unanimously left to the Chairman to impress upon Mrs \nWinter the conditions under which her position in the Institution would \nbe continued.  \n The committee unanimously begged the Chairman to make strong appeal \nto his [new] wife to take charge of the Ladies\u2019 Committee in place of Mrs \nScurfield, resigned\u201d (26th Nov. 1903). \n \n Already, Mrs Scurfield\u2019s withdrawal was revealing the extent to which she had \ndelegated practical decision making around clothing to Mrs. Winter. This ran against the \nintentions of the Committee that it should be the middle class Ladies\u2019 Committee who \ncarried this responsibility. A system which was apparently working smoothly in practice \nbecame problematic as soon as the effort was made to formalise it in a manner which \nwould have accorded a degree of decision making power to a working class woman. Some \nmembers of the committee became alarmed at the implication that they were not fully in \ncontrol.  \n 28\n \n Matters came to a head during the first two weeks in December when  Caws \nbecame involved in a full scale row with other Committee members because he had  \nagreed the allocation of clothing on the basis of reports from Mrs. Scurfield which had not \nbeen submitted for formal approval. Caws protested that the committee had never \npreviously disapproved any of Mrs. Scurfield\u2019s recommendations and that the delay was \nfrustrating when the boys were so clearly in need during the cold weather. But Mrs. \nScurfield\u2019s resignation had exposed weaknesses in the formal system. She had been voted \nonto the management committee as the main link to the Ladies\u2019 Committee, not as the \nroute to Mrs. Winter. Unfortunately, the Ladies\u2019 Committee was more idea than reality - \nMrs. Scurfield was the Ladies\u2019 Committee so far as the Clothing Scheme was concerned. \nIn her absence the myth could no longer be sustained .    \n \n In order to help resolve the conflict, one Committee member suggested that until \nthe  Ladies\u2019 Committee could be reconstituted, he would take responsibility for liasing \nwith the COS, asking them to undertake investigative visiting  on behalf of the club.  This \nproposal was accepted and thus the principle reason for including a female member on the \nManagement Committee was removed. Subsequently, when the attempt failed to replace \nMrs Scurfield with the new wife of the Chairman a small amount of effort was put into \nreforming the Ladies\u2019 Committee, but without success. No suggestion was made to re-\nappoint a female investigator onto the  management committee. \n \n In the months following Mrs. Scurfield\u2019s departure, the club continued to \ndistribute clothing but mainly on the recommendation of individual members of the \nmanagement committee. Meanwhile there was a shift towards asking the boys to pay for \n 29\nitems: \u201con the motion of Capt. Hall seconded by Capt. Forster the committee agreed to let \nW. (216) have a pair of boots for 6 pence (25th Feb. 1904)\u201d and  \u201cCapt. Hall proposed and \nCapt. Forster seconded and it was agreed to allow (5) Tom K. An outfit for 3\/6 to be paid \nin advance\u201d (3rd March 1904).  In  May, Mrs. Winter  \u201cpaid in 7\/- cash for clothes \nsupplied.\u201d Meanwhile Thompson, (the Chairman), and Caws \u201cdistributed 3 doz. Pairs of \nstockings to the best attendees needing them\u201d (25th Feb. 1904). It was not until May 1904 \nthat the COS was asked to investigate a case, and as a result of the subsequent report, \nthose concerned were refused clothing. At this stage, Mrs. Winter appears to have been \ncompletely removed from decisions about clothing. Indeed her role in relation to the boys \nseems to have diminished considerably. Apart from collecting money, she is mentioned in \nrelation to \u201ccolouring walls\u201d which the boys had \u201cdefaced,\u201d but this was a task directly \nassociated with caretaking. In the AGM of March that year, there is no  appreciation of \nher services,  and in April, the question of a permanent \u201cmale attendant\u201d was again raised. \nThis time, \u201cMr. Charlton elaborated a scheme\u201d which was put to a sub-committee to \ndiscuss in detail (21st April 1904). \n \nMrs Winter Replaced \n During the three months between the proposal to appoint a male attendant and the \nreport of the sub-committee the minutes suggest unease amongst the principle actors. \nCaws, always an eminently practical operator and probably always aware of the everyday \nrealities of club relations, was the only member of the Committee to speak against the \nproposal and refused to sit on the subcommittee. He then went on holiday. While he was \naway, Mrs. Winter took to her bed with rheumatic pains. On recovery, she requested a \nholiday on Whit  Monday.  This was agreed and for the first time, the Club was closed on \n 30\nthat day. Most significantly, at the beginning of June, \u201cDisorderly conduct was reported \nby Capt. Forster on the previous Monday. Mr. Smith reported bad conduct the previous \nSunday when he was in attendance and had to put the boys out\u201d (2nd June 1904). \n \n Seven boys were expelled and only Caws and one other voted against this \ndecision.  Smith\u2019s voice is increasingly apparent in the minutes. By now he was not only \nworking regularly in the club, making suggestions for the development of activities, \nhelping with events and making use of his joinery skills in the building, but he had also \nbecome a member of the management committee. Meanwhile in the listing of helpers, \nMrs. Winter\u2019s name is completely absent  (16th June 1904).  \n \n When the subcommittee reported at the end of July 1904, they \u201cAdvised the \nappointment of Mr. J.A. Smith as Resident Superintendent in lieu of Mrs. Winter, and at \nthe same remuneration which Mrs Winter receives\u201d (28th July 1904).  At the special \nmeeting convened to discuss this advice, it was agreed that Smith should take up residence \n1st October following with the following job description: \n \u201c-To take charge of the shelter, keep it clean and in order, and maintain \ndiscipline among the lads during club hours; \n -To report to Cttee in detail all cases requiring help; \n -To take charge of the clothing scheme\u201d (4th August 1904).  \n \nCaws was the only member of the Committee to vote against, contending that \u201cMrs. \nWinter\u2019s services were too valuable to be dispensed with.\u201d  \n  \n Having agreed that they would help Mrs Winter find employment, the Committee  \n 31\nsecured rooms nearby which they paid Smith to fit out as a shop. They also took a \ncollection in order to give her a sum of money with which to start her new life. This \nclearly did not compensate her for the loss of her home and job.  Later, she was to apply to \nthe committee for references to enable her to take cleaning jobs. Early the following year, \nSmith complained to the Committee that she had been publicly accusing him of taking her \njob and it was agreed that she should be barred from the club\u2019s premises. Thus her role in \nthe life of the Waifs Rescue Agency and Street Vendors\u2019 club formally ended.  \n \n \nConclusion \nWhen Mrs. Winter was replaced by Jim Smith, he came to live in the premises of \nLambton Street. Occasional reference in the minutes implies that his wife (whose name is \nnot given) worked informally alongside him, particularly adopting those duties, such as \nproviding refreshments for the boys, which were associated with the maternal role.  \n \nHenceforward, the tone of the work was to change.  Smith, a joiner by trade and \ntherefore as a respectable, skilled working class man, a significant role model for the boys, \nfocused his energies upon club programming and activities.  Finding employment for \nmembers when they left school, helping  particular boys in moments of need and visiting \nfamilies remained part of his working brief but this became supplementary. The COS \nremained involved for a short while, but a number of cases investigated with negative \noutcomes for the boys, and in one particular case the subsequent refusal of a father to \nallow his boys to attend the club, meant that its role gradually receded. When Mr. Coley \nof the COS died in 1905, shortly before Frank Caws, the Lambton Street club quietly \n 32\ndropped the association. When Smith undertook home visits, he did not do so in order to \nprovide detailed reports on \u2018cases\u2019 but as a fellow worker. He offered the Management \ncommittee only general impressions. Yet his recommendations regarding individual boys \nwere generally trusted.  \n \n Thus a transition was effected which consolidated the agency as a public facility, a \nrecreational club offering a collective benefit for local boys. Although individual boys \nwere helped, all attempts at rescue ceased and  investigative case work disappeared. In the \nprocess the Committee was relieved of many of its anxieties and tensions. Significantly, at \nthis point, efforts to develop the Ladies\u2019 Committee changed direction. In the immediate \nfuture supportive women were asked simply to organise occasional bazaars and social \nevents for the purposes of fundraising. In this way, women were removed from all direct \ndecision-making influence. \n  \nSmith and his wife enabled the Waifs  Rescue Agency and Street Vendors\u2019 club to \nreconcile a number of competing perspectives around class and gender relations without \nthe necessity of accommodating female power. Whereas in the initial stages of the club\u2019s \nlife reconciliation had been achieved by the practically combined but separately conceived \nefforts of Mrs. Scurfield and Mrs. Winter, aided by Frank Caws, the collapse of that \napproach, precipitated by the departure of Mrs. Scurfield had revealed a deep unease \nabout working class and female power and decision making. Mrs. Winter was initially \nuseful as a means of mediating relations with boys and their families, but her role could \nonly be conceptualised within a maternalism which continuously reinforced her inferior \nand ultimately oppositional class and gender status. Ultimately, her position depended \n 33\nupon the willingness of the men to trust a woman of their own class. Mrs Scurfield\u2019s \napproach helped sustaining the liberal discourse of rescue in which Mrs Winter\u2019s activities \nwere inscribed, but it played to the promotional narrative rather than reflecting the real \nrelations of the club. When the real relations were exposed, the appointment of Smith, as a \nwaged and therefore subject employee, represented a shift  towards an acceptance of the \nnecessity of a working class presence in the day to day life in the club but in that shift, the \nmaintenance of masculine authority was paramount.    \n \n When Frank Caws died in April 1905, the process of transition from a rescue \nagency to a boys\u2019 club was completed in all but name.  It was as a Boys\u2019 Club, with Smith \nand his wife in residence for the next fifty years that Lambton Street was to become a \nmajor centre of activities-based youth work for boys serving the whole of Sunderland. Its \nactivities eventually became a by-word for respectability and opportunity for working \nclass boys in the town but even after the admission of girls to membership in the 1970s, \nwomen never again occupied a central role in its work. Meanwhile, the contributions of \nMrs Winter and Mrs Scurfield were quietly forgotten.  \n \nNotes and References \n \n \n \n[1] Dates in the text refer to the  Minutes Books of the Lambton Street Management Committee.  \n \n[2] David Bell (Ed.)
