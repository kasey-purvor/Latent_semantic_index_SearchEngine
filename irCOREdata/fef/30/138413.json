The risk attached to\nlengthy and slow-moving logistics \u2018pipelines\u2019 has become unsustainable, forcing\norganisations to look again at how their supply chains are structured and managed. This\npaper suggests that the key to survival in these changed conditions is through \u2018agility\u2019, in\nparticular by the creation of responsive supply chains. A distinction is drawn between the\nphilosophies of \u2018leanness\u2019 and \u2018agility\u2019 and the appropriate application of these ideas is\ndiscussed.\nThe importance of time as a competitive weapon has been recognised for some time (1).\nThe ability to be able to meet the demands of customers for ever-shorter delivery times\nand to ensure that supply can be synchronised to meet the peaks and troughs of demand is\nclearly of critical importance in this era of \u2018time-based competition (2).\nTo become more responsive to the needs of the market requires more than speed, it also\nrequires a high level of manoeuvrability that today has come to be termed agility.\nWhat is Agility?\nAgility is a business-wide capability that embraces organisational structures, information\nsystems, logistics processes and, in particular, mindsets. A key characteristic of an agile\norganisation is flexibility. Indeed the origins of agility as a business concept lies in\nflexible manufacturing systems (FMS). Initially it was thought that the route to\nmanufacturing flexibility was through automation to enable rapid change (i.e. reduced\nset-up times) and thus a greater responsiveness to changes in product mix or volume.\nLater this idea of manufacturing flexibility was extended into the wider business context\n(3) and the concept of agility as an organisational orientation was born.\nAgility should not be confused with \u2018leanness\u2019. Lean is about doing more with less. The\nterm is often used in connection with lean manufacturing (4) to imply a \u2018zero inventory\u2019,\njust-in-time approach. Paradoxically, many companies that have adopted lean\nmanufacturing as a business practice are anything but agile in their supply chain. The car\nindustry in many ways illustrates this conundrum. The origins of lean manufacturing can\nbe traced to the Toyota Production System (TPS) (5), with its focus on the reduction and\nelimination of waste.\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nWhilst the lessons learned from the TPS principles have had a profound impact o\nmanufacturing practices in a wide range of industries around the world, it seems that the\ntendency has been for the benefits of lean thinking to be restricted to the factory. Thus\nwe encounter the paradoxical situation where vehicle manufacture is extremely efficient\nwith throughput time in the factory typically down to twelve hours or less, yet inventory\nof finished vehicles can be as high as two months of sales \u2013 and still the customer has to\nwait for weeks or even months to get the car of their choice!\nWhilst leanness may be an element of agility in certain circumstances, by itself it will not\nenable the organisation to meet the precise needs of the customer more rapidly.\nWebster\u2019s Dictionary makes the distinction clearly when it defines lean as \u2018containing\nlittle fat\u2019 whereas agile is defined as \u2018nimble\u2019.\nThere are certain conditions where a lean approach makes sense. In particular where\ndemand is predictable and the requirement for variety is low and volume is high. In fact\nthe very conditions in which Toyota developed the lean philosophy. The problems arise\nwhen we attempt to implant that philosophy into situations where demand is less\npredictable, the requirement for variety is high and consequently volume at the individual\nstock keeping unit (SKU) level is low \u2013 a set of characteristics which is more typical of\nthe Western automobile industry. In other words it could be argued that many firms have\nbeen misguided in their attempts to adopt a lean model in conditions to which is not\nsuited.\nFigure 1 suggests that the three critical dimensions of Variety. Variability (or\npredictability) and Volume determine which approach \u2013 agile or lean \u2013 make greatest\nsense.\nFigure 1 : Agile or Lean?\nAGILE\nLEAN\nHi\nLo\nLo Hi\nVariability\nVariety\n\u201cAgility\u201d is needed in\nless predictable\nenvironments where\ndemand is volatile and the\nrequirement for variety\nis high.\n\u201cLean\u201d works best in\nhigh volume, low\nvariety and predictable\nenvironments.\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nAgility might therefore be defined as the ability of an organisation to respond rapidly to\nchanges in demand both in terms of volume and variety. The market conditions in which\nmany companies find themselves are characterised by volatile and unpredictable demand.\nHence the increased urgency of the search for agility.\nThe routes to agility\nTo be truly agile a supply chain must possess a number of distinguishing characteristics\nas Figure 2 suggests. Firstly, the agile supply chain is market sensitive. By market\nsensitive is meant that the supply chain is capable of reading and responding to real\ndemand. Most organisations are forecast-driven rather than demand-driven. In other\nwords because they have little direct feed-forward from the marketplace by way of data\non actual customer requirements they are forced to make forecasts based upon past sales\nor shipments and convert these forecasts into inventory. The breakthroughs of the last\ndecade in the form of Efficient Consumer Response (ECR) and the use of information\ntechnology to capture data on demand direct from the point-of-sale or point-of-use are\nnow transforming the organisation\u2019s ability to hear the voice of the market and to respond\ndirectly to it.\nFigure 2 : The Agile Supply Chain\nAgile\nsupply\nchain\nNetwork\nbased\nVirtual\nMarket\nsensitive\nProcess\nintegration\nThe use of information technology to share data between buyers and suppliers is, in\neffect, creating a virtual supply chain. Virtual supply chains are information based rather\nthan inventory based.\nConventional logistics systems are based upon a paradigm that seeks to identify the\noptimal quantities of inventory ands its spatial location. Complex formulae and\nalgorithms exist to support this inventory-based business model. Paradoxically, what we\nare now learning is that once we have visibility of demand through shared information,\nthe premise upon which these formulae are based no longer holds. Electronic Data\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nInterchange (EDI) and now the Internet have enabled partners in the supply chain to act\nupon the same data i.e. real demand, rather than be dependent upon the distorted and\nnoisy picture that emerges when orders are transmitted from one step to another in an\nextended chain.\nShared information between supply chain partners can only be fully leveraged through\nprocess integration. By process integration is meant collaborative working between\nbuyers and suppliers, joint product development, common systems and shared\ninformation. This form of co-operation in the supply chain is becoming ever more\nprevalent as companies focus on managing their core competencies and outsource all\nother activities. In this new world a greater reliance on suppliers and alliance partners\nbecomes inevitable and, hence, a new style of relationship is essential. In the \u2018extended\nenterprise\u2019 as it is often called, there can be no boundaries and an ethos of trust and\ncommitment must prevail. Along with process integration comes joint strategy\ndetermination, buyer-supplier teams, transparency of information and even open-book\naccounting.\nThis idea of the supply chain as a confederation of partners linked together as a network\nprovides the fourth ingredient of agility. There is a growing recognition that individual\nbusinesses no longer compete as stand-alone entities but rather as supply chains. We are\nnow entering the era of \u2018network competition\u2019 where the prizes will go to those\norganisations who can better structure, co-ordinate and manage the relationships with\ntheir partners in a network committed to better, closer and more agile relationships with\ntheir final customers. It can be argued that in today\u2019s challenging global markets, the\nroute to sustainable advantage lies in being able to leverage the respective strengths and\ncompetencies of network partners to achieve greater responsiveness to market needs.\nHybrid strategies are often appropriate\nThere will be occasions when either a \u2018pure\u2019 agile or lean strategy might be appropriate\nfor a supply chain. However there will often be situations where a combination of the\ntwo may be appropriate i.e. a hybrid strategy.\nHybrid supply chain strategies recognise that within a mixed portfolio of products and\nmarkets there will be some products where demand is stable and predictable and some\nwhere the converse is true. As Fisher has pointed out (6) it is important that the\ncharacteristics of demand are recognised in the design of supply chains. However, it is\nnot necessarily the case that a supply chain should be either lean or agile. Instead a\nsupply chain may need to be lean for part of the time and agile for the rest.\nZara the Spanish fashion company provides a good example of this hybrid supply chain\nstrategy (7).\nZara is one of Spain\u2019s most successful and dynamic apparel companies, producing\nfashionable clothing to appeal to an international target market of 18 to 35 year-olds.\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nZara\u2019s international market positioning places it in direct competition with some of the\nmost skilled operations in the business, including Italian fashion giant Benetton and US-\nbased The Gap and The Limited. Its rapid growth and on-going success in such a fiercely\ncompetitive environment is in fact a testament to its ability to establish an agile supply\nchain which still incorporates many \u2018lean\u2019 characteristics. The pursuit of this hybrid\nstrategy has enabled Zara to develop one of the most effective quick-response systems in\nits industry.\nThe whole process of supplying goods to the stores begins with cross-functional teams -\ncomprising fashion, commercial and retail specialists - working within Zara\u2019s Design\nDepartment at the company\u2019s headquarters in La Coru\u00f1a. The designs reflect the latest in\ninternational fashion trends, with inspiration gleaned through visits to fashion shows,\ncompetitors\u2019 stores, university campuses, pubs, cafes and clubs, plus any other venues or\nevents deemed to be relevant to the lifestyles of the target customers. The team\u2019s\nunderstanding of fashion trends is further guided by regular inflows of EPOS data and\nother information from all of the company\u2019s stores and sites around the world.\nRaw materials are procured through the company\u2019s buying offices in the UK, China and\nThe Netherlands, with most of the materials themselves coming in from Mauritius, New\nZealand, Australia, Morocco, China, India, Turkey, Korea, Italy and Germany.\nApproximately 40% of garments - those with the broadest and least transient appeal - are\nimported as finished goods from low-cost manufacturing centres in the Far East. The rest\nare produced by quick-response in Spain, using Zara\u2019s own highly automated factories\nand a network of smaller contractors. Material or fabric is also held in \u2018greige\u2019 i.e.undyed\nand unprinted and if demand for a particular garment turns out to be higher than expected\nthen local manufacturers can quickly manufacture additional product.\nZara\u2019s manufacturing systems are similar in many ways to those developed and employed\nso successfully by Benetton in Northern Italy, but refined using ideas developed in\nconjunction with Toyota. Only those operations which enhance cost-efficiency through\neconomies of scale are conducted in-house (such as dying, cutting, labelling and\npackaging). All other manufacturing activities, including the labour-intensive finishing\nstages are completed by networks of more than 300 small subcontractors, each\nspecialising in one particular part of the production process or garment type. These\nsubcontractors work exclusively for Zara\u2019s parent, Inditex SA. In return they receive the\nnecessary technological, financial and logistical support required to achieve stringent time\nand quality targets. The system is flexible enough to cope with sudden changes in\ndemand, though production is always kept at a level slightly below expected sales, to\nkeep stock moving. Zara has opted for undersupply, viewing it as a lesser evil than\nholding slow-moving or obsolete stock.\nThe role of the \u2018decoupling point\u2019\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nA major problem in most supply chains is their limited visibility of real demand. Because\nsupply chains tend to be extended with multiple levels of inventory between the point of\nproduction and the final marketplace, they tend to be forecast driven rather than demand\ndriven.\nThe point at which real demand penetrates upstream in a supply chain may be termed the\ndecoupling point. Previously, this idea has been termed the \u2018order penetration\u2019 point (8).\nHowever, the issue is not how far the order penetrates, but how far real demand is made\nvisible. Orders are aggregations of demand, often delayed and distorted due to the actions\nand decisions of intermediaries (9). On the other hand, demand reflects the ongoing\nrequirement in the final marketplace in as close to real-time as possible.\nThe decoupling point should also dictate the form in which inventory is held. Thus, in\nthe uppermost example in Figure 3, demand penetrates right to the point of manufacture\nand inventory is probably held in the form of components or materials. In the lower\nexample, demand is only visible at the end of the chain. Hence inventory will be in the\nform of finished product. The aim of the agile supply chain should be to carry inventory\nin a generic form \u2013 that is, standard semi-finished products awaiting final assembly or\nlocalisation. This is the concept of \u2018postponement\u2019, a vital element in any agile strategy.\nFigure 3 : Decoupling points a strategic inventory\nDriven\nBy\nDemand\nDriven\nBy\nForecast\nPlants Distribution\nCentres\nWarehouses Depots\nPostponement, or delayed configuration, is based on the principle of seeking to design\nproducts using common platforms, components or modules but where the final assembly\nor customisation does not take place until the final market destination and\/or customer\nrequirement is known.\nThe advantages of the strategy of postponement are several (10). Firstly, inventory can be\nheld at a generic level so that there will be fewer stock-keeping variants and hence less\ninventory in total. Secondly, because the inventory is generic, its flexibility is greater,\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nmeaning that the same components, modules or platforms can be embodied in a variety of\nend products.\nThirdly, forecasting is easier at the generic level than at the level of the finished item.\nThis last point is particularly relevant in global markets where local forecasts will be less\naccurate than a forecast for worldwide volume. Furthermore, the ability to customise\nproducts locally means that a higher level of variety may be offered at lower total cost\nenabling strategies of \u2018mass-customisation\u2019 to be pursued.\nThe challenge to supply chain management is to seek to develop \u2018lean\u2019 strategies up to\nthe decoupling point but \u2018agile\u2019 strategies beyond that point. In other words by using\ngeneric or modular inventory to postpone the final commitment it should be possible to\nachieve volume-oriented economies of scale through product standardisation. The flow\nof product up to the decoupling point may well be forecast driven; after the decoupling\npoint it should be demand driven.\nAn important point to recognise is that there are actually two decoupling points. The first\nis the one already referred to i.e. the \u2018material\u2019 decoupling point where strategic inventory\nis held in as generic a form as possible. This point ideally should lie as far downstream in\nthe supply chain and as close to the final market place as possible. The second\ndecoupling point is the \u2018information\u2019 decoupling point. The idea here is that this should\nlie as far as possible upstream in the supply chain \u2013 it is in effect the furthest point to\nwhich information on real final demand penetrates.\nMason-Jones et.al (11) have demonstrated through simulation the beneficial impact that\ninformation feedback can have on reducing upstream amplification and distortion of\ndemand.\nBy managing these two decoupling points a powerful opportunity for agile response can\nbe created. At the same time the notorious \u2018bullwhip\u2019 or Forrester effect (12) (13) can be\nreduced. Billington and Amaral (14) have suggested that whilst the combined effect of\nshared information in a supply chain and delayed configuration through postponement\ncan significantly improve responsiveness, the effect of delayed configuration is actually\ngreater than the impact created by shared information (15).\nLeveraging supplier relations\nOne of the keys to achieving agile response to fast-changing markets lies upstream of the\norganisation in the quality of supplier relationships. Often it is the lead-time of in-bound\nsuppliers that limits the ability of a manufacturer to respond rapidly to customer\nrequirements. Equally new product introduction time can be dramatically reduced\nthrough the involvement of suppliers in the innovation process.\nStill today many companies have not recognised that competitive advantage that can be\nderived from closer relationships with key suppliers (16). Instead there is often an arms-\nlength, even adversarial approach to managing the supplier base. To really leverage the\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nopportunity for greater agility through closer supplier relationships requires a number of\npre-requisites to be in place.\nFirstly, it is inevitable that the supplier base be rationalised. It is not possible to create\nclose relationships through process integration with multiple suppliers. Agile companies\nhave sought to identify a limited number of \u2018strategic\u2019 suppliers with whom they can\nwork as partners through linked systems and processes. Whilst the dangers of single-\nsourcing need to be recognised, the advantages of having a network of key suppliers able\nto synchronise their production and deliveries with the requirements of the company are\nconsiderable. Opportunities for establishing information-based, paperless systems\nutilising concepts of vendor managed inventory (VMI), for example, are clearly greater\nwhen both buyer and supplier see each other as vital links in a more competitive supply\nchain.\nA further pre-requisite for the creation of a more agile supplier base is a high level of\nshared information. In particular there has to be clear visibility of downstream demand;\ndata on real demand needs to be captured as far down the chain as possible and shared\nwith upstream suppliers. As wells as the IT and the IS necessary to make this possible\nthere needs to be a willingness amongst the partners to put aside any previous mistrust\nand instead to create an environment in which information can freely flow in both\ndirections in the chain.\nPerhaps the most important pre-requisite is the need for a high level of \u2018connectivity\u2019\nbetween the firm and its strategic suppliers. What this implies is not just the exchange of\ninformation on demand and inventory levels, but also multiple collaborative working\nrelationships across the organisations at all levels. It is increasingly common today for\ncompanies to create supplier development teams which are cross functional and as such\nare intended to interface with the equivalent customers management team within the\nsupplying organisation (17). Figure 4 illustrates the concept.\nFigure 4 : Building stronger partnerships through multiple links\nSupplier Customer\nCustomer\nManagement\nSupplier\nDevelopment\nR&D\nProduction\nInformation\nSystems\nMarketing\nMarketing\nOperations\nBusiness\nDevelopment\nInformation\nSystems\nReducing complexity to enhance agility\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\nOne of the biggest barriers to agility is the way that complexity tends to increase as\ncompanies grow and extend their marketing reach. Often this complexity comes through\nproduct and brand proliferation but also it can come through the organisational structures\nand management processes that have grown up over time (18).\nThe reduction of product complexity should be a major priority for marketing and\nlogistics people working together. Product complexity includes not only design issues\n(e.g. the number of non-standard components in a product) but also excessive variety that\ndoes not contribute to greater customer or consumer value. Procter & Gamble for\nexample have in recent years focussed on product range rationalisation, pack\nstandardisation and reduced promotional activity in order to attack complexity.\nComplexity is caused also by the way in which organisation structures and management\nprocesses are designed. One of the benefits of the Business Process Re-engineering\n(BPR) movement has been that is has highlighted the need to reduce or eliminate the\nmany non-value activities that are inherent in traditional functionally-based business.\nBreaking down functional silos and re-grouping around value-creating processes will help\nreduce organisational complexity. A further aid to complexity reduction, and hence,\nenhanced agility, will be the development of a human resource strategy that leads to\nmulti-skilling and encourages cross-functional working. Team-based management has\nbeen demonstrated (19) to be a highly effective facilitator of organisational agility.\nConclusions\nMarketing management has not traditionally recognised the importance of logistics and\nsupply chain management as a key element in gaining advantage in the marketplace.\nHowever, in today\u2019s more challenging business environment, where volatility and\nunpredictable demand becomes the norm, it is essential that the importance of agility be\nrecognised.\nLeading companies are already implementing marketing strategies which are underpinned\nby a supply chain strategy designed with agility in mind. These are the organisations that\nwill be best equipped for survival in the uncertain markets of the 21st century.\nReferences\n(1) Stalk, George, \u201cTime \u2013 The Next Source of Competitive Advantage\u201d, Harvard\nBusiness Review, July\/August 1988\n(2) Stalk, George and Thomas Hood, Competing Against Time, New York : The Free\nPress, 1990\n(3) Nagel, Roger and Rick Dove, 21st Century Manufacturing Enterprise Strategy,\nIncocca Institute, Lehigh Unversity, 1991\nIndustrial Marketing Management, Vol 29., No. 1., 2000\n(4) Womack, James, Daniel Jones & Daniel Roos, The Machine that Changed the\nWorld, New York : Macmillan, 1990\n(5) Ohno, Taiichi, The Toyota Production System Beyond Large Scale Production,\nPortland, Oregon : Productivity Press, 1988\n(6) Fisher, Marshall, \u201cWhat is the Right Supply Chain for your Product?\u201d, Harvard\nBusiness Review, March\/April 1997\n(7) Christopher, Martin, Logistics & Supply Chain Management, London : Pitmans,\n1998 (Zara case written by Helen Peck)\n(8) Sharman, Graham, \u201cThe Rediscovery of Logistics\u201d, Harvard Business Review,\nSeptember\/October, 1984\n(9) Burbidge, John, Production Flow Analysis, Oxford, UK : Oxford University\nPress, 1989\n(10) van Hoek, Remko, \u201cReconfiguring the Supply Chain to Implement Postponed\nManufacturing\u201d, International Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 9, No. 1,\n1998\n(11) Mason-Jones, Rachel, Mohammed Naim and Denis Towill, \u201cThe Impact of\nPipeline Control on Supply Chain Dynamics\u201d, International Journal of Logistics\nManagement, Vol. 8, No. 2, 1997\n(12) Forrester, Jay, Industrial Dynamics, Cambridge M.A. : MIT Press, 1961\n(13) Lee, Hau, Paddy Padmanabhan and Seungjin Whang, \u201cThe Paralysing Curse of\nthe Bullwhip Effect in a Supply Chain\u201d, Sloan Management Review, Spring 1997\n(14) Billington, Corey and Jason Amaral, \u201cInvesting in Product Design to Maximise\nProfitability Through Postponement\u201d in Andersen, David (ed), Achieving Supply\nChain Excellence Through Technology, San Francisco : Montgomery Research,\n1999\n(15) Gavirneni, Sringesh and Sridhar Tayur, Delayed Product Differentiation versus\nInformation Sharing, Working Paper, Graduate School of Industrial\nAdministration, Carnegie Mellon University, August 1997\n(16) Hines, Peter, Creating World Class Suppliers, London, Pitmans, 1994\n(17) Lewis, Jordan, The Connected Corporation, New York, Free Press, 1995\n(18) Mills, D.
