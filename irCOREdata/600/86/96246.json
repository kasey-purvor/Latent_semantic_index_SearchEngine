(2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n3 \nTeamwork refers to the way in which team members function and coordinate to \nproduce \u2018synchronised\u2019 output (1). Patient safety research has demonstrated that poor \nteamwork is a causal factor underlying critical incidents in the intensive care unit \n(ICU) (2). Due to this, a growing amount of research has been conducted within the \nICU in order to identify the specific components of teamwork that influence patient \noutcomes (3,4). The main purpose of this research is to guide the design of training \nmaterials and workplace interventions to improve teamwork. However, at present the \nfindings from studies investigating ICU teamwork are disparate and lack synthesis, \ntherefore the extent to which they can influence practice, training and future research \nis limited. This review takes an industrial psychology perspective to summarise the \nICU teamwork literature, and develops a conceptual team performance framework \ntailored for intensive care medicine.  \n \nTeam performance frameworks \n \nPsychology researchers in high-risk industries (e.g. aviation, military, nuclear power) \nhave found effective teamwork as crucial for maintaining safety within these domains \n(5,6). In order to better understand the relationship between teamwork and \nperformance in these settings, team performance frameworks (or models) have been \ndeveloped. These show team outputs (e.g. team effectiveness, performance, errors) to \nbe influenced by group \u2018processes\u2019 related to team communication, leadership, \ncoordination and decision-making (7-11). Furthermore, group processes are \ninfluenced by a range of \u2018inputs\u2019 (e.g. group structures, member characteristics, work \ntasks) (12-14).  The purposes of team performance frameworks are three-fold. Firstly, \nthey systematise the mechanisms that predict team performance, thus facilitating the \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009).

Secondly, they detail the conditions, structures and procedures \nknown to be indicative of effective teamwork, therefore providing valuable \ninformation for the training and assessment of teamwork skills. Lastly, team \nframeworks guide the evaluation of teamwork interventions through developing a \nstructure against which to test expected change (e.g. attitudes, behaviours, \nperformance).  \n \nIn aviation, team performance frameworks have been used to develop sets of team \ncompetencies for flight crews (15). With respect to healthcare, it is necessary to \ndevelop tailored team performance frameworks that reflect the demands of specialities \nsuch as intensive care medicine (16). This paper reviews the ICU teamwork literature \nin order to consolidate knowledge on the relationship between teamwork structures, \nbehaviours and performance in the ICU, and to begin the development of a team \nperformance framework. It uses a standard group process model from psychology to \nconsider studies that have collected data on the relationship between teamwork \nbehaviours and ICU outcomes.  \n \nMethod \n \nThe identification of ICU teamwork related studies involved a search of the Pubmed, \nScience Direct and Web of Knowledge Psychology databases for papers on teamwork \nin the ICU published since 1990. The search terms, method and inclusion criteria are \nshown in figure 1.

Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n5 \nthe article considered the topic of teamwork and performance in the ICU. The \nremaining articles (n=59) were then filtered in order to ascertain whether they actually \nprovided empirical information on the relationship between ICU teamwork and \noutcomes (whether quantitative or qualitative). An examination of reference lists from \nthe filtered articles (n=31) uncovered a further 4 items.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 HERE \n \nResults \n \nIn total 35 studies were identified as having investigated teamwork in the ICU. This \nset incorporates 31 peer-reviewed articles (of which 29 were published in medical \njournals), two book chapters and two peer-reviewed conference papers. Among the \narticles was a human factors error analysis of critical incident data that reported on 10 \nstudies of error in the ICU (17). This paper was included rather than the individual \ncritical incident studies discussed in it. The data collection methods used for the 35 \nstudies included in the review varied considerably, and are listed in table 1.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE \n \nOf the papers not included in the final selection, many did not empirically investigate \nteamwork, and focused on topics such as education, promoting multidisciplinary \nteamwork, decision-support mechanisms and communicating with patients. The \nsections below discuss the key findings from the 35 studies that were identified by the \nsearch strategy. The findings are considered in terms of four teamwork processes \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009).

Observations of ICU teams (19) have shown \nerrors in the ICU to be concentrated after communication events (e.g. shift changes \nand handoffs) and 37% of errors to be associated with communication between nurses \nand physicians.  Pronovost\u2019s group at John Hopkins University have analysed ICU \nadverse event\/critical incident data from incident reporting systems (20-22). Their \nanalysis has identified recurring team communication failures that lead to patient \nharm, with written and verbal communications during routine care, hand-offs, and \ncrises being found most susceptible to error. More specifically, they found critical \nincidents to occur due to a reluctance of nursing staff to report observed errors or \npatient care issues, a lack of communication between clinicians and nursing staff on \ntreatment changes, inaccurate information transfer between different ICU care teams \nand poor information dissemination on newly admitted patients. Survey and interview \nresearch have also examined the relationship between ICU team communications and \npatient outcomes (23), with timely, accurate and open communication between nurses \nand physicians being shown as predictive of patient length of stay and staff turnover \n(24).  \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n7 \nObservations in high-fidelity simulator studies have studied team communication \nbehaviours. Video analysis of teamwork during simulated patient resuscitations has \nfound the communication skills of ICU residents to be rated most highly if they \ncommunicate clearly at all times, encourage team member input, listen to staff \nfeedback, and consistently use directed verbal and non-verbal communications. \nConversely, the communication skills of residents are rated most poorly when they \nfail to acknowledge staff communications and do not use directed verbal and non-\nverbal communications (25). High-fidelity simulator research has also established a \nrelationship between team communication and technical performance (26), with ICU \nteams being assessed during the management of septic shock. Teams were rated \nhighly if team members made clear and direct requests, employed closed loop \ncommunications, communicated the urgency of patient problems and shared \ninformation on the patient care plan. Teams were rated poorly if team members did \nnot request appropriate information, or did not communicate treatment priorities and \nproblems with patients. Teams rather than individuals were assessed and correlations \nwere found between ratings on technical performance (e.g. making diagnoses) and \nscores on the behavioural aspects of performance (e.g. communication). \n \nThomas and colleagues (27) have built on measurements for assessing teamwork in \ncommercial aviation in order to develop an observational rating system for assessing \nteamwork skills during neonatal resuscitation. Their research has investigated the \nrelationship between assessments of teamwork and non-compliance with Neonatal \nresuscitation standards during 132 videoed neonatal resuscitations (27). The \nfrequency with which NICU teams were observed to demonstrate team behaviours \nrelated to communication (e.g. information sharing, asking questions about infant \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

Furthermore, \ninterns who received team training as part of neonatal resuscitation training were \nshown to display more teamwork related behaviours (e.g. information sharing) than \nthose who did not receive training (28). \n \nSurvey research has investigated aspects of team structure, and in particular how \nstatus hierarchies influence perceptions of teamwork (29,30). For example, a majority \nof physicians report highly positive perceptions of communication openness between \nnurses and physicians, as compared to just over a third of nurses (30). A similar \ndifference was found between senior and junior physicians. Survey research has also \nshown that ICUs with teams reporting high levels of group development (e.g. whether \nteam members trust one another, discuss goals. and are not in conflict) have lower \nrisk-adjusted mortality rates (31). Observational research during the ICU round has \nshown team member roles to influence interruptive behaviours, with physicians \ninterrupting other caregivers roughly twice as often as nurses do (32). Ethnographic \nwork in Canada has identified factors that influence whether ICU team members \ncommunicate collaboratively (33). These include whether the team has a shared \nperception of who was in the decision-making role during a specific scenario; whether \nteam members work together to reach an understanding on patient conditions, and \nwhether there are demanding time constraints on the delivery of care.  \n \nTeam communication research in the ICU has shown communication to be linked to \nsafety and performance, and that team structures and characteristics influence \nteamwork. Research in military and aviation has found similar trends (34), with team \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n9 \nleadership being identified as particularly important for structuring and regulating \nteam communication processes (35).  \n \nTeam Leadership \n \nData from ICU critical incident studies have indicated the importance of effective \nteam leadership for safety (17,22). Team leadership refers to the guidance of a team \n(36), and involves defining goals, setting expectations, organizing team resources and \ncoordinating team activities (37). Studies of leadership in industry and acute medicine \ntend to concentrate on four levels; action leaders (e.g. ad-hoc emergency teams), \noperational leaders (e.g. unit-level supervisors), tactical leaders (e.g. departmental \nmanagers) and strategic leaders (e.g. board level directors) (38-40). Leadership \nresearch in the ICU mostly focuses on the \u2018action\u2019 level. For example, simulator and \nreal-life observations have shown associations between ratings of performance and \nleadership behaviours such as encouraging team member input, stating and evaluating \nplans, asserting opinions when appropriate, listening to staff feedback, delegating \ntasks effectively, prioritising aspects of care and ensuring team member comfort with \nallotted duties (25-27).  \n \nSimulator research has shown that team performance during cardiovascular \nresuscitation is optimal when the first arriving team leader (e.g. senior nurse, junior \nphysician) demonstrates more immediate directive leadership behaviours (i.e. \ncoordinating the teams), and when the late arriving senior physician systematically \nevaluates the situation and guides the team rather than taking charge immediately \n(41). Stockwell and colleagues (42) have investigated the impact of physician \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n10 \nmanagement skills on the care provided to paediatric ICU patients. Using the \nPhysician Management Index (PMI), 827 residents and fellows rated daily the ability \nof 8 attending physicians on 20 dimensions, including their ability to effectively lead \nand communicate with the ICU team, to manage resources, to set high standards, and \nto provide support on issues of performance and team development. The study found \nhigher overall daily ratings by staff for attending physicians on the PMI were \nassociated with higher numbers of patient goals being completed during NICU shifts. \nHowever, due to the small sample of physicians being assessed, it is not clear which \nspecific attitudes\/behaviours lead to this association.  \n \nAlthough effective team leadership appears important for the ICU, there are still \nrelatively few in-depth investigations of senior physician leadership skills (43). Data \nfrom trauma centres, which face many similar challenges to the ICU, provide \ninteresting insights into the nature of team leadership in acute healthcare teams. \nObservational and interview research with trauma centre teams has shown that team \nleaders demonstrate \u2018dynamic delegation\u2019 behaviours, whereby the senior physician \ndelegates and withdraws the leadership role to junior physicians in order to spread the \nintense workload and to build junior physician confidence (44).  Furthermore, \nscenario-based research investigating leadership during trauma resuscitation has \nindicated that leadership behaviours vary according to the situation. Team leaders \nshow more directive leadership behaviours when the severity of trauma is high, or \nwhen a team is inexperienced (45). However, when trauma severity is low, or teams \nare highly experienced, team leaders delegate more responsibility to junior team \nmembers. This indicates the \u2018contingent\u2019 nature of team leadership within the ICU, \nwhereby leadership behaviours are adapted according to the situation (46).  \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n11 \n \n \nResearch in neonatal ICUs has also indicated that the leadership style of the team \nleader influences teamwork. Specifically, leader inclusiveness (e.g. listening and \nencouraging junior team member ideas) has been shown to result in team members \nbecoming more involved in ICU quality improvement programmes (47). Such \nresearch resonates with a long tradition of psychology research investigating \nleadership style (48,49). Additionally, leadership oriented interventions that focus on \ntraining teamwork skills (e.g. conflict management) to senior nurses and physicians \nare shown to result in staff having positive perceptions of unit leadership (50). \nHowever very little research has been published on how ICU senior physicians lead \nmedical teams whilst managing ICUs on a day-to-day basis, and a better \nunderstanding is required of how team leadership behaviours influence the \ncommunication and coordination behaviours of ICU team members.  \n \nTeam coordination \n \nTeam coordination refers to the concerted and synchronous performance of work \nactivities by team members, with each team member maintaining an awareness of one \nanother\u2019s work (51). Researching team coordination can be challenging, as it is \ndifficult to distinguish between these behaviours, and team communication and \nleadership behaviours. Both of these are precursors (e.g. distributing workloads) and \nintegral (e.g. information transfer) for effective team coordination, yet do not fully \naccount for how team members adapt their activities to dovetail with one another.  \n \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n12 \nAnalyses of teams managing critical events during crisis management training has \nindicated errors to result from poor coordination, for example nurses being overloaded \nwith requests, poor task delegation and a lack of prioritisation for care activities (52). \nAdditionally, attitudinal research with ICU staff has found positive perceptions of \nteam coordination (e.g. timely information transfer, awareness of team member \nactivities, team member role clarity) to be associated with lower error rates (53). \nSurvey research has also shown high levels of cooperation between ICU nurses and \nphysicians to reduce reports of staff burnout (54). Observations during the real-life \nprovision of ICU care have been used to study the behaviours ICU team members use \nto coordinate activities together. These behaviours include nurses cross checking \nphysician-generated patient care plans, physicians and nurses providing \u2018heads-up\u2019 \nalerts to each other about pertinent information outside of the rounds and patient \nsummaries being used to recap the discussion and highlight the core duties of team \nmembers (55,56). Lastly, structured observations in the NICU have shown effective \nworkload management (i.e. task distribution and prioritisation) to be associated with \nindependent measures of neonatal resuscitation quality (27). \n \nAlthough team coordination is determined by factors such as team communication \nand team leadership, attempts have been made to restructure ICU tasks to improve \ncoordination. For example, an intervention to improve patient transfers between \nsurgery and ICU has adopted coordination principles from Formula 1 racing pit-stop \nteams (57). Through segmenting the handover process into different stages (pre-\nhandover, equipment and technology handover, information handover, discussion and \nplanning), using checklists, and assigning ICU and surgical team members clear roles, \nthere were improvements in teamwork (e.g. less omissions of patient information) and \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n13 \nfewer technical errors (e.g. equipment preparation) during intra-team handovers. \nInterventions have also focused on ICU rounds to make them more concise; to ensure \npatient care plan information is explicit; to ensure decision-makers are present, and to \ngenerate a secure team-based environment (58). This resulted in ICU staff reporting a \nbetter understanding of patient care plans alongside higher levels of satisfaction with \nrounds. Furthermore, adopting daily goal sheets (which structure the round process) \nhas been shown to result in ICU residents and nurses better understanding their \npatient care duties, and in turn reduced patient lengths of stay (59). This resonates \nwith the psychology \u2018shared mental model\u2019 literature, whereby teams communicate \nand coordinate more effectively when members form a shared mental model for goals, \ntasks and team member roles and responsibilities (60).  These shared mental models \nfacilitate team decision-making, which has also been of interest to ICU researchers. \n \nTeam decision-making \n \nTeam decision-making relates to decision-making (either by the leader on behalf of \nthe team or amongst the members of a team) through integrating information and \nperceptions from the members of a team (61). As with team coordination, team \ndecision-making is influenced by team communication and leadership. In the ICU, \ncollaborative decision-making has been linked to improved patient outcomes. For \nexample, units with higher levels of collaboration between nurses and physicians \nduring patient-transfer decisions have lower rates of risk-adjusted mortalities and \nhigher levels of nurse and resident job satisfaction (62). High levels of collaboration \nhave also been suggested to potentially improve end-of-life care (63). Poor decision-\nmaking processes, for example the application of inappropriate plans and the use of \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n14 \nunsuitable techniques, have been shown to contribute to the occurrence of critical \nincidents (17). Clinician encouragement of team member communication and \ncontributions during the ICU round patient decision-making process is associated with \na reduction in adverse event rates (64). Furthermore, nurses and physicians tend to \nagree that junior team members should be able to question senior physician decision-\nmaking and that decision-making should include junior team member input (65). \n \nObservational research in the ICU by Patel and Arocha (66) has shown that levels of \ncollaboration during decision-making processes are influenced by the severity of \npatient conditions. When patient illnesses are well understood, team communication \nprocesses tend to be more \u2018democratic\u2019, and decisions are made after contributions \nfrom all team members. However, for more complicated patients, senior physicians \ntend to make key decisions autocratically, and with nurses communicating after \nperforming information-gathering tasks. This reflects findings from trauma centres, \nwhich indicate team leaders to adapt their behaviours according to the situation. In \nparticular, during high pressure phases of work, senior physicians adapt their \nbehaviours to effectively lead the team (e.g. through adopting a swift and autocratic \ndecision-making style) (45,67). This is aligned with the literature on decision-making \nand incident command within the military, emergency services, and aviation \nindustries (68). Perceptions of caregiver involvement during decision-making in the \nICU have also been shown to be influenced by team member-role. When asked to \nreport perceptions of involvement in patient decision-making during the ICU round, \nsenior nurses and junior physicians tend to report feeling uninvolved compared to \nsenior physicians (69). This is consistent with survey research showing that nurses \nreport finding it difficult to speak-up during decision-making, with fewer nurses than \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n15 \nphysicians feeling that disagreements in the ICU are properly resolved, or that input \nfrom nurses about patient care is well received (70). Furthermore, ICU management \ntend to overestimate the extent to which nurses will have positive attitudes towards \nteamwork, with variations in attitudes even existing between the ICUs of a single \ninstitution (71).  \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe findings from the ICU research investigating teamwork are incorporated into a \nprototype team performance framework for the ICU (Figure 2). In the framework, \nteam processes are sub-divided into the processes of communication, leadership, \ncoordination and decision-making. These processes (and behaviours drawn from the \nliterature that are indicative of effective team processes) are shown as influencing \nICU \u2018outputs\u2019. Additionally, the inputs of \u2018team\u2019, \u2018task\u2019, and \u2018leader\u2019 are listed. These \nare factors which have been shown in either the ICU or general psychology literature \nto influence teamwork processes (7-14). The concepts included in the framework are \nlimited to those that have been directly addressed in the ICU teamwork literature. \nHowever, it must be noted that there a number of teamwork concepts within the \napplied psychology literature that have yet to be investigated within the ICU, yet have \nbeen shown as important for safety and performance in other high-risk settings.  For \nexample, shared mental models for teamwork and taskwork information (72), team \nadaptability to changing circumstances (73), and the influence of organisational \nculture upon teamwork behaviours (74,75) are just some of the additional factors \nknown to influence team performance. Furthermore, the framework does not \nnecessarily illustrate the frequent changes in team composition that occur in ICU, the \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n16 \ninfluence this can have on performance (73), or the techniques that are used to \nmitigate the impact of constant changes in team personnel (e.g. having a well-\nestablished understanding of team roles (76)).   Lastly, it is worth noting that the \nframework better reflects the leadership structure in \u2018closed\u2019 ICU, where unlike in \n\u2018open\u2019 ICUs, leadership and decision-making tends to rest with the intensivist (77).   \n \nThere are a number of issues for discussion regarding this literature review. Firstly, \nthe article search strategy focused on the relationship between teamwork and \nperformance outcomes. It did not fully consider the consistency or quality of the ICU \nteamwork measurement tools. For example, data have been published on safety \nclimate surveys containing subscales that focus on attitudes towards teamwork (65,71 \n78), and several observational measures have been developed to assess teamwork (25-\n27). It was beyond the scope of this review to assess or compare measures for their \nreliability or validity. However, there does exist a need to develop a comprehensive \nlisting and review of the various tools available for measuring teamwork in the ICU.   \n \nIt is also necessary to consider the types of data (self-report, observational, attitudinal, \ninterviews) that have been collected to understand teamwork in the ICU (table 1). \nEach have well-documented limitations (79), such as the Hawthorn effect (80) or \ncommon method bias (81), and studies vary considerably in design, sampling \nstrategies and statistical analysis. For example, surveys and observations in simulators \ntend to associate quantitative data measuring teamwork and patient\/team outcomes, \nwhereas real-life observations and interviews tend to generalise from the behavioural \npatterns observed by investigators or practioner reflections on teamwork. This makes \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (2009). Developing a team performance framework for the Intensive Care Unit. Critical Care Medicine, \n35, 1789-1793 \n   \n17 \nit difficult for this review to compare the weight or significance of individual study \nfindings.   \n \nLastly, it was found that the majority of reviewed studies supported the relationship \nbetween teamwork and ICU performance. As with any review of published literature, \nit is likely to be influenced by a publication bias (82). However, it is noticeable that a \nnumber of papers reported non-significant relationships between teamwork and \noutcome data. For example, although teamwork interventions and perceptions of \nteamwork are often associated with reduced patient length of stay, they are rarely \nassociated with risk-adjusted mortality (24, 42).  Furthermore, when ICUs are \ncompared against one another, units with higher ratings of teamwork do not \nnecessarily perform better on measures of unit performance (23). Lastly, many studies \nuse correlation analyses to test the relationship between measures of teamwork and \nmeasures of performance. More complicated predictive analyses are required to fully \nunderstand the relationship between teamwork processes and technical or \norganisational outcomes. This in itself poses numerous difficulties, for example \nensuring that study sample sizes are adequate and that teamwork metrics are reliable. \nFurthermore, there is need to develop longitudinal research designs and to identify a \nwider range of ICU outcome data that can be used for assessing team performance \n(16,83).  \n \nConclusions \n \nThe prototype team performance framework (figure 2) consolidates the existing \nknowledge regarding teamwork and outcomes in the ICU, and provides a structure \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

An emerging direction \nfor future research is the relationship between team leadership and team performance. \nDue to the hierarchical nature of acute medical teams, the behaviours of senior \nphysicians appear to significantly influence the perceptions and behaviours of other \nteam members. In developing interventions and team training programmes, it is \ntherefore critical to fully understand the role of leadership in ICU teams.  \nPublished as: Reader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.
