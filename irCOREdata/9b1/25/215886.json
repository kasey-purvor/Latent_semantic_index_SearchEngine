The particular organisation on which our analysis \nfocuses is a traditional UK based British engineering company that in 1999 bought a \ncollective of family-run businesses, scattered across Scandinavia.  This paper draws \non the findings from a research project carried out with the newly created company \nduring the post-merger period. The paper explores how the two collectives brought \ntogether via a merger are trying to work, make and implement decisions and move \nforward. The analysis shows how the tension generated by the different narratives \nbrought to place in the merger and the initial resistance to engage in collective action \nwas finally overcome by the co-authoring of a new narrative, a new \u2018proceduralised \ncontext\u2019. This collective co-construction is seen in the paper not as a final output but \nrather as part of a constant becoming, a \u2018liquid decision making\u2019 process (after \nBauman, 2000). A finding of this study is that enabling symbolic spaces (contexts) for \nnew narratives to emerge and develop can support the improvement of collective \nactions. \n \nKeywords: Mergers and Acquisitions, collective decision making, co-authored \nnarratives, qualitative methodology, stories. \n \n1. Mergers and acquisitions, collective action and the narrative context \n \n After a merger or acquisition process most organisations focus on the integration \nof the different ways of working that the now joined organisations have. In addressing \nthis concern, research has traditionally focused on \u2018post-merger integration\u2019; \nsuggesting that efforts need to be concentrated in achieving the successful post-\nmerger \u2018acculturation\u2019 of both companies. This usually implies achieving a \u2018symbolic \nclosure\u2019. The emphasis is therefore on the \u2018outcome\u2019; rarely does research focus on \nthe process of becoming a new \u2013different- organisation and how that collective action \nis decided, implemented and accomplished. It is this area in the study of M&A, and its \nimplication for collective decision making that this case study seeks to illuminate. \nWhen it comes to M&A , there is a general agreement about the overwhelming \npercentage of failure in the process (Allen, 2002; Deloitte and Touche, 2000; Larsson \nand Finkelstein, 1999; Hunt, 1998); as well as consensus over the fact that we do not \nknow enough about these \u2018complex events in organizational life\u2019 (Larsson and \nFinkelstein, 1999:1) in order to say why they fail.  Undeniably, organizations do not \nundertake M&As for the sake of learning or experimentation, the ride is too costly \nand often painful.  M&As are usually strategic moves to expand and create new \nopportunities for commercial organisations. Organisations attempt M&As when \ntrying to realise synergies (Larsson and Finkelstein, 1999), create value (Haspeslagh \nand Jemison, 1991, in Vaara, 2002) or to transfer capabilities from one organization to \n 2 \nanother (Laamanen, 1997). However, it would appear that despite the growing \nliterature dedicated to the area, there is a \u2018black box\u2019 when it comes to understand the \nsuccess or failure of these organisational processes (Allen et al, 2002). It is to the \nopening of this \u2018black box\u2019 that this paper aims to contribute.  \nAllen et al (2002) contrasts organic growth with mergers and suggest that \n\u201cmergers [\u2026] challenge organisations\u2026in a very fundamental way.  It is this \ntransformation of structures that presents serious management problems.\u201d The \nauthors\u2019 highlight the time-dependency involved in developing the synergetic and \nincreased performance levels of a merger. They conclude that \"success is not easily \nachieved as it involves combining firms that previously operated competing business \nmodels, that were organized, structured, and operated in their own idiosyncratic \nfashion and which contain different people that 'know' and share different things.\u201d \n(Allen et al, 2002:326).  \nThe outcome of an M&A entails a combination of human, material and \nfinancial assets of at least two organizations in a new legal and accounting entity \n(Hunt, 1998:324).  In most contexts, to combine two things supposes certain \ncharacteristics. The action necessarily brings change.  Furthermore, combining also \nrequires some sort of union, link or relationship and the \u2018outcome\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018whole\u2019 \u2013 will \nnot be the same as the parts which were brought together \u2013 sameness is the domain of \ncloning, not combining. In the context of M&As the entailed relationship is implicit \nin the behavioural metaphors which have been used to talk about these events (Hunt, \n1998; Schneider and Dunbar, 1992).  Looking at media narratives Schneider and \nDunbar (1992) argue that hostile takeovers can be seen as inter-organisational events \nthat threaten organizational identity and integrity.  A hostile takeover creates what \nthey call a \u201cnarrative thirst\u201d, a need for explanations that reduce uncertainty and in \ndoing so provide the illusion of control. \nThe dominant view is that the entities involved in an M&A need to \u2018integrate\u2019 \nor more accurately to \u2018assimilate\u2019 after the merger is \u2018completed\u2019. Existing research in \nthe area tends to represent mainly the economic, financial and management \napproaches to integration, ignoring the more social, cultural and psychological aspects \nof the process.  Cultural research, however, has focused on achieving \u2018acculturation\u2019 \nthrough \u2018social controls\u2019 (for example: Larsson and Lubatkin, 2001:1573) as opposed \nto allowing for a more organic approach.  However, if a M&A, as suggest above, is a \ncase of \u2018relationships\u2019 and \u2018wholes\u2019, then a different approach may be required.  The \npoint about relationships is that they develop organically over time.  The point about \nwholes, which are different to their combined parts, is that they will contain \n\u2018emergent\u2019 properties.  The question then becomes how are these relationships played \nout and what happens when two organizations are combined?  It is suggested in the \npaper that the success of an M&A lies in the organization\u2019s ability to identify the \nemergent properties of \u2018combining\u2019 and to enable those properties, thus encouraging \n\u2018organic-ness\u2019, in an otherwise mechanistic process (Garcia-Lorenzo and Nolas, \n2005). This, it is argued, may be achieved by looking at the collective process of co-\nauthoring narratives and listening to the tensions which, naturally abound.   \nThe analysis of the empirical material explores this hypothesis from a \ncollective decision making point of view. It looks at how two organisational \ncollectives under the stress and pressure for change, really react to problems of \nworking together, of making and implementing decisions. Understanding how those \ngroups go about decision making should in principle, tell us more about those \ncharacteristics which \u201cwe should endeavour to build into our decision tools\u201d \n(Humphreys, 1997:3). Collective decision making is difficult to achieve when even \n 3 \n\u2018the organisation\u2019 itself is difficult to define \u2013i.e. in the mist of a merger or a post-\nmerger process-. It becomes then imperative to develop a new language, to create a \nnarrative space, which can help to understand the new organisational boundaries and \nsupport the improvement of collective actions. \nBrezilion (this volume) in describing how a \u2018proceduralised context\u2019 comes \nabout in organisational collectives, considers that \u2018group norms\u2019 are one of the most \nimportant dimensions that affects the kinds of decisions made in organisations (pg \n126). Thus, that a key point of the decision-making group is its collective knowledge \nand the context in which this knowledge is expressed. The model presented helps us \nto understand what kind of knowledge is already shared by a group, but we have little \ninformation of the process by which that knowledge became to be shared when for \ninstance, collectives do not share the same history. Indeed, most of the models \npresented for collective decision making assume some level of shared knowledge \nand\/or working habits among the members of the collective. A M&A process \nhowever presents us with another challenge: among two organisations brought \ntogether by a M&A, there might not be previously agreed or shared knowledge. And \nyet if they are to move forward, the decision making process still has to be collective. \nThus, we might need to explore further how a \u2018proceduralised context\u2019 is \nactually produced and how what might become part of that contextual knowledge gets \naccepted by the collective and eventually becomes taken-for-granted and shared. The \ncase presented in this paper aims to explore in detail one such process through which \nmembers of two organisations co-construct a narrative, a framework, in which \npotentially contextual knowledge is shared, contested and co-constructed before a co-\nauthored image of a potential future after the take-over emerges. This emerging \nnarrative however is not taken here as the \u2018final\u2019 collective decision to be \nimplemented but rather as what Humphreys and Jones (2006) would call a \u2018rhyzome \nin the decision-hedgehog\u2019.  \nThe analysis shows how the collective co-authored a new potential \n\u2018organisation\u2019. The process of collaboration or co-construction was however not \nlinear or conflict free. Due to the lack of \u2018stable structures\u2019 and constant becoming, \nthat a M&A process implies; the collective decision making process becomes \n\u2018constantly drifting\u2019, a bricolage, open, associative and decision maker driven \n(Humphreys and Jones, 2006:15). Through the co-construction of a narrative, \nknowledge, people and environment are created. Thus, the narrative in being co-\nauthored becomes a \u2018proceduralised context\u2019. \n \n2. The case study  \n \nMethodology \n \nThe empirical part of the paper is informed by data collected during a research \nproject with a UK based international engineering company \u2013 henceforth Acquirer \nBusiness (AB)\n1.  One of the project\u2019s aims was to understand some of the \norganisational challenges being faced by the company after the M&A process. The \npaper is based on the research collaboration with the marine business of the \norganisation \u2013 henceforth the acquirer marine business (AMB)\u2013 following an \ninternational acquisition of a collective of Scandinavian companies \u2013 henceforth the \nCollective - in 1999.  The resulting research aimed to reflect both the business needs \n                                                          \n1\n For an extended description of the organisations and the research project on which this paper is based \nsee Garcia-Lorenzo and Nolas, 2004. \n 4 \nand the research aims. Our analysis of the data draws from a set of 15 semi-structured \ninterviews and is further supported, by the discussion groups and workshops that were \npart of the project\u2019s qualitative methodology.  The research described in this paper has \nfollowed a qualitative approach to data gathering and analysis. This approach implies \nessentially an emphasis on processes and meanings rather than on an examination or \nmeasurement in terms of quantity, amount, intensity or frequency (Van Maanen, \n1982). \nFor a period of six months, the LSE research team worked in collaboration \nwith the 14 volunteers from the AB\u2019s fast track career programme.  Together with \nthese \u2018internal researchers\u2019 we were divided into four teams.  Over a three month \nperiod we conducted 44 interviews with senior management in the UK, Scandinavia \nand the US.   The interviewees accounted for 60% of AMB\u2019s senior management at \nthe three senior management levels \u2013 i.e. president and the executive committee, to \ntheir direct reports and their immediate next reports.  The interviewees also represent \nthe two industries making up the ABM \u2013 Commercial and Naval -, the different \nnationalities (UK, Swedish, Norwegian, Finish and American) and the different \norganisational units (production\/operations, customer interface and functions).  The \nsemi-structured interviews ran for an hour and a half, they were tape recorded with \nthe interviewees\u2019 consent and then transcribed verbatim.   \nIn the following section, we present the analysis of the data from which the \nemployees\u2019 stories have been extracted. Stories are one of the main forms of discourse \nthrough which organisational members share and transmit their experiences and \ntherefore co-author their organisational reality. The analysis of those stories followed \na combination of a top-down (theory informed) and bottom-up (emergent meanings \nand categories from the data) approach.  The first analysis coded the interviews by \ngeneral categories.  Following this initial analysis, codes were then ordered in terms \nof their frequency revealing the themes that interviewees were more concerned about. \nA second analysis focused specifically on the \u2018post-merger integration\u2019 and followed \na combination of thematic networks analysis (Atrride-Stirling, 2002) and narrative \nanalysis (Jovchelovitch, 2000; Vaara, 2002; Garcia, 2003).  \nThe main unit of analysis was the AMB, however we aim to express the \ndifferent voices of acquirer and acquired pre-merger organisations. The use of \ndifferent methods of data gathering \u2013 interviews and discussion groups - corresponds \nwith the attempt to use different viewpoints to gain a greater understanding of the \nphenomena being studied adding rigor, breadth and depth to our investigation (Flick, \n1992). The different methods can also facilitate and legitimate the diverse chorus of \nvoices, interests and perspectives that exist within an organisation. Thus, using an \ninterpretative approach and different methods of data gathering implies also looking \ninto the multiple narratives that give voice to, and allow the construction of multiple \norganisational worlds (Alvesson, 1995). \n \n \nThe context  \n \nThe AB started off as a partnership in 1884 and has since built up a world \nrenowned reputation associated with engineering excellence.  The company\u2019s \nestablished engineering success, especially on developing the gas turbine which has \nbecome its stamp of identity,  plays a fundamental role in shaping the company\u2019s \nreality and its ways of working.  The \u2018aerospace\u2019 nature of the business brings with it \na high risk and dire consequences in case of engineering failure.  As such, working \n 5 \nprocedures, processes and standards are rigorous and closely controlled. The structure \nof company however, is described as a \u2018matrix\u2019.  The company\u2019s functions \u2013i.e. HR, \nfinance department etc- are separated from the business, the production\/operation and \ncustomer interface units. This is a relatively new change since historically both \nfunctions and units used to work as one.  In 2003, the AB catered for four different \nmarkets: civil aerospace, defence aerospace, marine and energy.   \nThis paper concentrates on the Marine business which prior to the 1999 \nacquisition catered solely for the defence marine market in the UK. The \norganization\u2019s launch into the, until then, unfamiliar territory of the commercial \nmarket, doubled its capabilities and remit almost over night (the business is now \napproximately a 7,500 people operation; the majority of which are non-UK \nemployees).  For a company used to long time horizons and a slow pace of change the \nacquisition thrust them into uncharted territory.  \nThe Collective on the other hand, could be described as historically family-run \nbusinesses, scattered across Norway, Sweden and Finland.  Prior to the current \nresearch, the Collective had undergone a series of previous acquisitions \u2013 from within \nScandinavia followed by an acquisition from a British defence company.  As such the \nacquisition described in this paper was the second in a previous line of acquisitions.  \nThe product and brands acquired by the British defence company were not only very \nstrong in the commercial marine market, they were also very closely linked to the \nsites and communities in which they were produced.  Furthermore, it is important to \nnote that because of the short time-lapse between the two acquisitions (the British \ndefence company\u2019s acquisition and then AB acquisition of the Collective) there had \nbeen no \u2018integration\u2019, as such, between the British defence company and the \nCollective by the time of the second take-over took place.   \nThe Scandinavian company which bought part of the Collective in the first \nacquisition dates back to the 1970s.  This Norwegian company however, was more \nentrepreneurial and robust in their way of working than AB. Their flexibility is \nderived from the commercial market in which they work: time horizons are much \nshorter than in the military defence market and change is an expected part of everyday \nlife.  Conversely, having only been a listed company for a short time, existing outside \nthe more public sphere of business may also account for their more flexibility. The \nScandinavian company, which brought the collective of small businesses, developed \nfrom a ship yard into a \u2018whole value chain\u2019, that is a complete provider of not only of \nvessels but also equipment, design and aftermarket support.  The company grew \nrapidly, and in a very short period of time, with the offshore boom in Norway in the \nlate seventies.  Capitalising on the boom, and the knowledge developed during this \nperiod, the company transferred it to work stations around the world and is considered \nan international company.   \n In September 1999 AB acquired the Collective. The acquisition of the new \nbusiness is described by both acquirer and acquired as more of a hostile take-over \nrather than an M&A.  Attempts were made to foster a more amicable climate, \nincluding a consultancy-facilitated conference in May 2000, however these were \nunsuccessful in achieving their goals.  The following year saw a change of HR \nmanagement, a new president for the AB and the relocation to Scandinavia of key \nsenior figure.  These events helped to create a more positive atmosphere.  Finally, in \nMay 2001 an Annual General Meeting was held for all AB senior management from \nthe UK, Scandinavia and USA.  During this meeting, delegates discussed what the \nkey post-merger concerns were and suggested ways for dealing with them.  The \nmeeting brought up key organisational concerns which were explored in this \n 6 \ncollaborative research \u2013 \u2018cultural awareness\u2019 and \u2018roles and responsibilities\u2019 for \n\u2018working together\u2019.  What follows is the story that developed after this event.  \n \nAfter the merger \nOne of the key tenants of the narrative approach is the ability to describe \norganizational change in different ways, revealing multiple interpretations of the post-\nmerger situation and ensuing change (Vaara, 2002:217).  The analysis of the data \nrevealed that employees in both organisations positioned themselves differently with \nregard to four different but interrelated areas of concern: the effects of the merger on \neach company\u2019s reputation and brand name; the autonomy that the acquired firm \nwould have in light of tendencies towards centralisation of the acquirer company; the \ntype of organisational form that the new join organisation will have and how to make \nuse of the human richness and variety that the merger had brought about. These \nthemes, and the stories they inform, underline key concerns and unresolved anxieties \nthat employees of both companies had and that potentially have made any common \naction difficult. And yet, surprisingly, those tensions were expressed in a similar way \nregardless of company or country of origin. These themes constitute a \u2018narrative of \nprogress\u2019 that shaped the employees understanding of the change process and that \nallowed for a potential \u2018coming together after the merger\u2019 through a newly \nconstructed narrative between the employees of the two organisations.  \nThis \u2018narrative of progress\u2019 helps employees of both organisations to make \nsense of their experiences as well as serving as a guideline for future actions. Prior to \nthe merger AMB had been clear about what they did, how to do it and why they did it. \nThey were also clear about their future direction: expansion and growth.  AMB \nspecifically brought the Collective because they were leaders in their field.  However, \nhaving accomplished that expansion, the planned future seemed to present problems \nwhen the company\u2019s identity and ways of working were challenged by their \nassociation with the Collective.  \nIndeed, when people get involved with other stories and cultural beings they \ntend to reach what Hill calls a level of \u2018historical consciousness\u2019 (Hill, 1988:7) that \npresupposes the notion of \u2018the other\u2019. That is, any definition of a cultural self always \ninvolves a distinction of the values, characteristics and ways of life of others. This \ndefinition does not usually arise in situations of relative isolation, prosperity and \nstability. A period of instability and crisis, a threat to the old established ways, seems \nto be required, especially if this happens in the presence of, or in relation to, other \ncultural formations. It is when something assumed to be fixed, coherent and stable is \ndisplaced by the experience of doubt and uncertainty that challenges to the established \ncultural order occur (Garcia-Lorenzo, 2001). Table 1 summaries the coordinates of \nthe narratives brought about by the merger situation for the employees of both \norganisations (see also Garcia-Lorenzo and Nolas, 2005). Reading the table from left \nto right, we go from the common and explicitly discussed themes among the \nemployees to look at the underlying tensions the present different possibilities of what \nthe organisation could become in the future to end with the narrative coordinate the \nframes that discussion. The challenge would then be how to move from the present \ncoordinates towards a co-created narrative space that would support collective action \nand decision making among the employees of the merged organisations.  \n \n \n \n \n 7 \nCommon discussed themes Underlying Dialogical Tensions Narrative co-ordinates \nWorking together, \nstanding apart. \nTo support homogeneity or \ncapitalise on differences \nWhat: working \npractices \nThe different \norganisational \nstructures \nMatrix organisation vs. \nnetworking organisation.   \nHow: organisational \nstructure \nFormal decision-\nmaking process and \nownership \nCentralised vs. federal \norganising . \nWho: power relations \nThe brand  Focusing on the product or \non the customer. \nWhy: strategy focus. \n \nThe challenge of coordinated collective action \n \nThe main concerns employees from both companies had in relation to the new \nsituation was how to work together. The idea of two separate organizations based on \ndifferent national cultures needing to be merged together, is pervasive. \nIndeed, one of AMB\u2019s self-imposed tasks after the merger was to deal with the \n\u2018cultural difference\u2019 by raising awareness among all employees through seminars and \nworkshops. However, they explained business cultural differences through national \ncultural difference. Whereas this had been a good first step in dealing with the post-\nmerger situation, two years post-merger, there was a strong feeling that national \ncultural idiosyncrasies could not longer be held responsible for the continued \nchallenge of working together: \n\u201cThe national cultural variances is one thing, you can\u2019t do much about that except for, \nof course, be aware of it.  But there is I think there is more company cultural variations \nfrom one place to another\u2026\u201d (VP Business Division; Collective \u2013Norway; \nCommercial; Customer Unit; 6:30 ) \nAttributing difficulties of integration to difference in national culture, resulted \nin obscuring the tension regarding the different ways of working at market\/industry \nlevel.  Whereas AMB is designed to cater for both the naval and commercial markets \nthe two markets are however driven by different requirements and values.  For \nexample, the commercial market is driven by short lead times and large customer \nbasis, whereas the naval industry works with much longer lead times and fewer \ncustomers. Extensive reporting procedures, both financial and technical, overshadow \nthe purpose of the commercial organization, in particular their relationships with the \ncustomer.  For AMB however,  the bureaucratic processes and procedures are \nnecessary since constant checks make the products safe and secure and therefore \nsafeguard the organizations reputation in the market.  \nThe failure (slowness) to find an \u2018integrative\u2019 definition of what the new \ncompany\u2019s focus is going to be on, is attributed by both organisations to not having \nthe \u2018right people\u2019. AMB wants to find the right people to rectify this situation.  The \nCollective considers that they are the right people:  they have been successful in the \ncommercial market for years and were brought for this reason. They are therefore the \nmost appropriate people for the job: \n\u201cHaving the right people on board.  Because there is so many things come with people, \ntheir ability to communicate their willingness to change, their ambitions, willingness to \nbe successful and so a lot of things come with people.  People is really the key to \nsuccess. Competent people.\u201d (VP Business Division; Collective -Sweden; Commercial; \nOperation Unit; 4:61) \n 8 \n \nIn terms of future directions both organisations assume that \u2018assimilation\u2019 was \nthe way to deal with the challenge of the merger.  AMB was in fact aggressively \npromoting it whereas the Collective assumed it would happen and was defensive \nabout it.  \nIn attempts to move away from the \u2018sole-product\u2019 (gas turbine) way of  \nworking, AMB adopted a matrix structure separating its functions from the rest of the \nIEC businesses and reorganising itself internally into two main segments: the \noperational\/production business units and the customer interface business units. The \nsegments were intended to focus on different markets and customers needs.  However, \nthe tradition of one-product (gas turbine) one-market (defence) business restricted this \nmove.   \n \nDifferent organisational structures  \n \nAs such, one of the main challenges that both organisations faced after the \nmerger was to asses their different ways of organising. Whereas AMB was described \nas a \u2018hybrid matrix\u2019, inward-facing and shaped by their technology; the Collective \ndescribed themselves more as a network, outward-facing and working in partnerships \nwith customers to respond swiftly to customer demands. AMB was used to \u2018internal\u2019 \ncustomer relationships and defence industry contracts which run on a long-term basis \nand provide on-going security. This tension was specially felt by the Collective:  \n\u201cour global network is tailor made for supporting the marine business and [the \ncompany] is again looking for synergies that doesn\u2019t exist and I\u2019m afraid they could \nend up again destroying the business by looking for non-existent synergies.\u201d (Executive \nVP Business Division; Collective-Norway; Commercial; Customer Unit; 1:17) \nWhen the managers from both organisations referred to the structure and \nconfiguration of AMB, they talk about its \u2018segmentation\u2019 at several levels and the \nproblems this causes. The label conveys also the \u2018complicated\u2019 or \u2018messy\u2019 structure of \nAMB. Segmentation also has implications for the \u2018space\u2019 in which collective action \ncan take place as well as for limited or partial information sharing. The over-emphasis \non each \u2018segment\u2019, and the need to manage and control them (i.e. function, business, \nproduction and customer interface units), focuses the attention on each separate \n\u2018segment\u2019 and its efficient functioning rather than on the relationships between \nsegments and how they work together within an overall organization. Connectivity is \nfurther hindered by the absence of integrated information systems (e.g. databases and \nemail). Maintaining connections across the organization, and therefore relationships \nwas therefore seen as very important for any future collective action: \n\u201cIf this is to work, there has to be an extremely good link between market segment and \noperations and after market\u2026 Someone, and this is a quite challenging role for the top \nmanagement to lift themselves up and understand what's going on, because they are \ntalking about huge organisation, and \u2026 someone has to understand what is going on as \na whole for the future \u2026\u201d (Site Manager Factory; Collective \u2013 Norway; Commercial; \nOperation Unit; 2:46) \n \n \n \n \n \n 9 \nFormal decision-making process and ownership  \n \nThe acquisition, and subsequent encounter with the \u2018other\u2019 \u2013the Collective-, \nsurfaced taken-for-granted assumptions regarding identity, culture, organizational \nstructure and \u2018power\u2019 in both organisations. Although the Collective was acquired by \nAMB they were in fact living AMB\u2019s proposed future as a  \u2018systems integrator\u2019.  \nThus, the Collective had in a short space of time gone through the AMB\u2019s desired \ndevelopment trajectory before being bought up.  The Collective are the producers of a \nvariety of products and attend to diverse markets, they are forced to be outward \nfocused, tending to the needs of very different markets and customers, as well as \nproviding \u2018whole systems solutions\u2019 for those markets and customers.  \nThis is why the third common theme expresses the tension between autonomy \nand control \u2013headquarters vs. periphery-  among the two organisations.  It correspond \nwith the description of the M&A as a \u2018hostile take-over\u2019: \n\u201c\u2026they had to split the cake and decide who is in what and when you have worked for \nthe Company and many, which most of the people have for many years there is a \nloyalty to them.  So, there is an internal war that we are not releasing that information \nbecause they are taking over and what have you\u2026\u201d( VP Business Division; Collective \n\u2013Norway; Commercial; Customer Unit; 6:5) \nThe \u2018empire building mentality\u2019 felt by some as to be guiding the acquisition, \nillustrates also this tension. The use of this metaphor by the Collective reflects an \nincreasing frustration with the lack of openness.  They also feel devalued as a leading \ncommercial business and therefore under threat. On the other hand, AMB insists on \nthe need to develop a common \u2018standard\u2019 based on AMB\u2019s working practices, across \nthe now \u2018merged\u2019 organizations. The new working standards are perceived as both \npositive \u2013 improved financial management- but also threatening. When the imposed \nstandards impact on customer relationships or management of the world-wide service \nnetwork of the Collective, then such standardisation is \u2018centralising and problematic\u2019: \n\u201cbut the basic behind the ways of working, the style of working is quite different but it \nhas to be adopted to our type of business\u2026but you have to actually select what is right \nfor our type of business. You can't turn a marine business into an aircraft business, \nthat's totally different.\u201d (Site Manager Factory; Collective \u2013 Norway; Commercial; \nOperation Unit; 2:21 ) \nCentralisation implies a neutralisation of the Collective\u2019s decision-making \npower and expertise value. Participation in the decision-making process of the new \ncompany appears to be beyond their reach, despite knowledge, skills and contacts in \ntheir particular market.  \n\u201cI think they feel as the owner, I think they have bought this company, they own it, I \nmean it's not \u2026.. I don't feel that they treat the other, as equals.\u201d (Executive VP \nBusiness Division; Collective-Norway; Commercial; Customer Unit; 1:40 ) \nThis centralized model of decision-making is a central feature of AB\u2019s way of \norganising, despite the official \u2018matrix\u2019 organization. Control is exerted from the top \ndown and from the centre towards the periphery.  The Collective view their survival \nas dependent on the continued ability to be flexible through a distributed and \ndecentralized decision-making model:   \n\u201cit is a much bigger organisation and for people who've just been working for many \nyears, as I myself actually, in a small organisation you get used to speak with the \nowners every day and discuss problems coming up and you get a decision there and \n 10 \nthen\u2026\u201d( Site Manager Factory; Collective \u2013 Norway; Commercial; Operation Unit; \n2:12) \n \nThe autonomy vs. centralisation tension constitutes a first hand experience for \nboth the AMB and the Collective.  Here, we can actually visualise the \u2018ongoing battle\u2019 \nwhere history plays itself out, in an attempt to shape the organizational culture(s) of \nthe future.  The current struggle over ownership of business and market is likely to \nplay a significant role in the future development of business. \n \nRethinking the Brand \n \nThe new company\u2019s identity and vision is also challenged by the merger. A \nway of understanding this challenge is through the technological development and the \nvision for the company\u2019s future. AB is a technological innovator and leading in a \nparticular type of technology, in this case the gas turbine.  As previously mentioned \nthis technology shapes the way they work. The technology requires specialised \nbehaviour which is context specific. Sometimes this localised way of working does \nnot transfer easily.  This is starting to shape all the work processes of the new \ncompany allowing the Collective little autonomy in their field of expertise \nThe organisations reputation and self-identity of excellence in the field, both \nin terms of quality and standards are also being challenged. For instance, one of the \nmain characteristics of AB is the emphasis placed on \u2018engineering excellence\u2019 and the \nbelief that the key to future successful development lies in continuing this tradition. \nThe AB is a leader in its field, and interviewees frame their experience of the \norganization in these terms. However, the other side to this is, that the pride \nassociated with excellence is followed by a certain degree of arrogance: \n\u201c\u2026across the whole of [the company] there is a strong pride in the product and the \ntechnical excellence of the company.\u201d (Programme Director Business Division; AB-\nUK; Naval; Customer Unit; 10:14 ) \nFrom the perspective of the Collective, interviewees acknowledge the \n\u2018engineering excellence\u2019 of AB but also report that the imposition of the associated \nstandards may inhibit new ways of organizing more appropriate for the commercial \ncontext.  In that context, the success of the business relies on the \u2018relationship with the \ncustomer\u2019 and not only on \u2018engineering excellence\u2019. That is why the possibility of \ninappropriately transferring a way of working from one context to another, is already \nperceived as negative in the emerging narrative of a new joint organization:  \n\u201cI hope that everything we do is connected to the market.  Everything we do should be \ndriven from the market and we should organize ourselves from that perspective.\u201d (VP \nBusiness Division; Collective -Sweden; Commercial; Operation Unit; 4:6) \nBrands embody both organisational identity \u2013 \u2018engineering excellence\u2019 and \n\u2018relationships with customers\u2019 \u2013 and external relationships.  At the time of the merger \nAB initiated a process of  \u2018brand co-existence\u2019 with all the Collective brands, in order \nto ensure a degree of continuity with traditional Collective customers.  From the \nperspective of the Collective, AB brand represents quality and adds to their already \nstrong and reputable brands.  However, the AB brand, as an unknown brand in the \ncommercial marine industry, also brings with it price perceptions: \n\u201c\u2026the [AB] brand [\u2026] works two ways.  It has the quality image attached to it but \ndefinitively it also has a price image attached to it.  So I\u2019m not so sure whether that, in \n 11 \nwhat way, that has worked for us, to be honest \u2013 it could be both ways.  But also the \nbrand name is definitively a brand that is easy to join together as our own brand, I think \nit\u2019s something that probably makes staff proud of being a part of the brand name.\u201d \n(Executive VP Business Division; Collective-Norway; Commercial; Customer Unit; \n1:12) \nIn our case both organisations \u2013 AB and Collective \u2013 are sites of embedded \nknowledge and expertise.  Their knowledge and expertise is appropriate for the \ncontext in which they operate and defines them both.  In a merger process, trying to \n\u2018assimilate\u2019 can create an asymmetry resulting in the lost of the very knowledge and \nexpertise the new organization would like to preserve as its strength.   \nThe acquisition made by AB was based on a narrative of progress, of \ndevelopment and growth.  However, the encounter with the \u2018other\u2019 \u2013the Collective\u2019- \nhas lead employees in both organisations to question certain taken-for-granted \nelements of that narrative leading to tensions when it comes to think about future \ndirections. We have found within this narrative of progress tensions, a reflection of \nthe challenges to current ways of organising as well as the struggle for emergence of a \nnew narrative. \n \nCo-creating a narrative space to act together \n \nThe narrative that both companies share spans from the one product focus (gas \nturbine engine) in AB to the segment organisation focus (customer\/market) in the \ncurrent organisation and aims to move both companies towards focusing on being a \n\u2018systems integrator\u2019 \u2013providing full service and maintenance to consumers-  in the \nfuture. The way interviewees talk about the new common future organisation \u2013 \n\u2018systems integration\u2019 and \u2018whole value chain\u2019 \u2013 provides us with the first insights of a \ncommonly constructed narrative. The analysis shows employees on both companies \nprojecting themselves into a common future.  The difference still arises in the role \nplayed by each, the how to achieve the future vision, between single provider or \npart(s) of the whole.  The terminology used reflects the centralised and de-centralised \nways of working, respectively.  In the first instance, one actor does the integration, in \nthis case the organisation: the organisation integrates systems \u2013 the systems are \ndependant on the organisation.  The second reflects a more networked way of working \n(chain) with organisations being integral parts of the chain but with value only \nderiving from the chain as a whole.  AB sees itself as a central agent (provider) of all-\nincorporating systems for industry, whereas the Collective sees itself and part of a \nvalue chain (process) in achieving solutions for industry.  The difference in subtle but \nimportant and will effect future action. This new organisation would, according to \ninterviewees, veer away from the current - cumbersome - organisational form, and \nwould be able to incorporate both AB and the Collective: \n\u201cthey started as a shipyard but definitively over the years decided to grow into the \nwhole value chain\u2026when it comes to [X], we have always been a system integrator. \nWe don\u2019t understand why\u2026I mean [the company] wants to transform the business into \nbeing a systems integrator, I definitively agree with that. But we have always been, we \nare probably the most successful system integrator in the world, where we have \ndelivered huge packages\u2026 we have done this for years and years and it\u2019s nothing new \nfor us.\u201d (Executive VP Business Division; Collective-Norway; Commercial; Customer \nUnit; 1:21) \n 12 \nAnd to do so employees form both organisation are already suggesting \nalternative ways to work together. One of them is to modify current ways of \norganising such as information sharing. This will involve the exchange of relevant \ninformation in the organization. The lack of exchange at this point is explained as a \ntechnical problem related to security issues and to the lack of common IT \ninfrastructure. In the future both companies agree that information should be \naccessible and more open for all employees to work with.  \n\u201cThere is an internal war that we are not releasing that information because they are \ntaking over and what have you.  So there is a tense \u2013 I think I have experienced from \nall, have impression from many of the places in different segments or units that they \nhave had and still have problems with that\u2026We may have suffered because they \nhaven\u2019t been able to get information for somebody.  I\u2019m not saying purposely holding \nback but it doesn\u2019t give us the priority which we would like to have and so on\u2026\u201d (VP \nBusiness Division; Collective -Sweden; Commercial; Operation Unit; 4:59) \nAgreeing on the need to leave certain aspects of the organizational cultures \nunchanged, interviewees talked about areas that can be transformed without altering \nthe identity and essential business practices necessary for the continuity and survival \nin the respective industries: \n\u201cI think that we are always going to be separate, mainly because of the customer part, \nthe naval contractual requirements are always going to be different from the \ncommercial.  The fact that the products are different doesn\u2019t matter too much apart \nfrom the security requirements\u2026\u201d ( Programme Director Business Division; AB-UK;  \nNaval; Customer Unit; 10:12) \nWhen the communication and emotional state required in order for the new \norganizational form to emerge are the focus, the positions cease to be opposites.  \nTrust, between AB and the Collective, is recognized as necessary in order to be able \nto move into the future. But the two organisations are not there yet. There is too much \nresistance (to the hostile take-over), but yet not enough time (since the merger), and \nhistory:  \n\u201cAgain, that\u2019s the one thing, the management of face-to-face meetings and the building \nof trust across the business \u2013 it is an issue.\u201d (Head of Business Management; AB \nCorporate-UK; Function; 8:86) \n \nConclusions \nThe paper has looked into the process of how people make sense - personally \nand collectively - of organisational change processes through the stories and \nnarratives they share. We have seen how these stories have helped employees of both \ncompanies  to create continuity and commonality of reference and hence to legitimate \nparticular ways of organising (Turnbull, 2002). \nBut the frameworks that the employees use, are not static, they become (re) \nproduced and challenged through everyday interactions especially when a change \nprocess occurs. Indeed, the constant changes in organisations and in the work \nenvironment challenge people\u2019s efforts to create and maintain a sustained work-\nnarrative that allows for decision making processes or even to derive a sense of \npersonal identity from work (Sennett, 2001). That is why stories are being constantly \ntold and re-created.  \nWhile the existing literature does an excellent job of illustrating the multiple \nstories that exist during organisational change processes, it does not generally \n 13 \nemphasise the interconnectivity of those narratives or the way in which those stories \nmight impact on co-ordinated action. During change initiatives individuals are usually \nencouraged to coordinate their thoughts, actions and practices so as to be attentive to \nthe interdependencies of the community (Vaara, 2002). A narrative approach provides \na vehicle for understanding how organised collective action might be achieved within \na changing situation (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002). Through the collection, handling and \nanalysis of emergent narratives, as the ones explored in this paper, researchers could \nhave a powerful vehicle for gaining insight about how such coordinated outcomes \nare(not) supported and achieved.  \nThe analysis has shown how through the co-authoring of a new narrative it is \npossible to articulate a new potential \u2018organisation\u2019. Through the co-construction of \nthis new narrative, knowledge, people and environment can be co-created allowing \nthe narrative to become a \u2018proceduralised context\u2019. \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nAllen et al (2002) Complex Systems and the Merger Process in Technology Analysis & \nStrategic Management Vol.14 No.3 \nAlvesson, M. & Berg, P.
