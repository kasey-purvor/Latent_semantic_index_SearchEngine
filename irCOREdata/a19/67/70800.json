Whilst such a view may be appropriate in defining pure, or prototypical, \nclasses of each activity, the value and necessity of such a distinction is broken down \nwhen researchers are goal-directed to study complex work domains in order to foster \ntechnological change. In this paper, we outline a rapprochement of these methods, which \nwe term cognitive ethnography. The value of qualifying ethnography in this way is to \nemphasise systematically the differences between ethnography as a radial category and \nthe kinds of legitimate method used to study work practices which are often referred to as \nethnographic, but which in practice differ in important ways from prototypical \nethnographic studies. Features of cognitive ethnography such as observational \nspecificity, verifiability and purposivenes challenge many of the tenets of a pure \nethnographic method, yet they are essential for studies that are undertaken to inform \ntechnological change. We illustrate our arguments with reference to a project to develop \na tool for supporting design re-use in innovative design environments. \nPutting ethnography to work \n4 \nSince the seminal work of Simon (1969), the design of technological artefacts has been \nincreasingly characterised as a cognitive activity, and many researchers have employed \nthe observational and experimental methods of cognitive psychology in understanding \nthe nature of design expertise and in developing and evaluating tools for supporting the \ndesign process (e.g., Guindon, 1990; Visser, 1990). There are a number of reasons why \ndesign might be seen as the territory of cognitive psychologists, of which two concern us \nhere. First, as Simon (1969) points out, design represents the archetypal complex \nproblem-solving activity undertaken by individuals.  In this sense, cognitive \npsychologists use design as a domain in which to further their understanding of \n'cognition in-the-head'. Second, the hypothetico-deductive research tradition that \nunderpins cognitive psychology can be seen as providing an analogy for design practice. \nCarroll and Campbell (1989) describe the process of designing technological devices as a \ntask-artefact cycle, in which the analysis of tasks motivates technological developments, \nwhich in turn affect the nature and conditions of task performance. In essence, artefacts \nare implicit psychological hypotheses that are tested through subsequent empirical \nevaluation. \n Whilst it may appear natural to conceptualise design as a cognitive activity, \ndesign is also typically a highly context-bound endeavour, situated, as it is, within \ncommercial organisations whose practices, structures and social interactions shape both \nfinal design products and the processes by which those products are achieved (cf. \nBuchiarelli, 1988). Given the highly contextualised nature of design activity, it remains \nparadoxical that the majority of existing studies of design expertise have ignored the role \nof situational and social factors in design in preference to carrying out laboratory-style \ninvestigations in which such factors are controlled for. Manipulations instead tend to \nfocus on variables such as the designer\u2019s skill or experience level or the type of problem \nthat is being tackled (e.g., routine or non-routine). This rather narrow, de-contextualised \nfocus of much design research is also echoed in much of the traditional research in other \ndomains of human skill such as medical diagnosis. As Hoffman, Feltovich and Ford \n(1997) note, however, research is beginning to reveal that constraints and opportunities \nPutting ethnography to work \n5 \narising from contextual and social factors are at least as important determinants of the \nexercise of expertise as are task-specific and skill-specific variables. Thus there is a need \nfor methodologies beyond laboratory experimentation.  \n A context-sensitive technique with which cognitive psychologists are familiar is \nverbal protocol analysis. Ericsson and Simon (1993) claim that verbal report data can be \ncollected in situ without necessarily interfering with task performance, to offer a \ncomplete, accurate and objective account for a wide range of cognitive activities, notably \nthe kinds of problem-solving activity thought to underlie design (e.g., Simon, 1969; Ball \n& Ormerod, 1995). Whilst these arguments may be open to dispute (e.g., Nisbett & \nWilson, 1977), there is no doubt that verbal protocol analysis has proved a valuable \nmethod for the exploration of cognitive performance in both pure and applied task \ndomains. It remains the case, however, that such methods are typically used to \nunderstand single-person cognition in socially-impoverished environments, rather than \nmulti-agent cognition in full-blown, people-rich environments. Problem solving which is \ncontextualised by other people (e.g., problem solving which arises in team-oriented \nenvironments such as hospitals, businesses and design groups) would seem to require \nmethods of analysis that are often unfamiliar coinage for cognitive psychologists.  \n Requirements for observational analyses of situated behaviours suggest that a \ntechnique such as ethnography (e.g., Hammersley & Atkinson, 1983), which has been \nused in sociological and anthropological research, might usefully be employed. \nEthnography aims to provide accounts of activity as perceived and recognised by the \nindividuals present within the situation as participant observers. This approach affords \ninteresting advantages over traditional cognitivist techniques in that it is geared toward \ngleaning insights on important aspects of human activity which more scientific \ntechniques tend to miss -- including behaviours that arise at the social interface or \nbehaviours which may not be directed towards the attainment of organisational or \nmanagerial goals. \n A key question faced by design researchers and practitioners, as well as those \nfrom other areas of human factors, is the extent to which ethnography can, or indeed \nPutting ethnography to work \n6 \nshould, be adapted so as to render it sensitive to the aims of cognitive psychology. There \nare two key areas in which there is an apparent clash between the aims of ethnography \nand cognition, which map onto the reasons espoused above for the cognitive \n\u2018territorialisation\u2019 of design. First, the goal of understanding cognition in-the-head (i.e., \nprocesses, mechanisms, structures and representations that are inherently mental in \nnature) seems diametrically opposed to the study of cognition as a disembodied cultural \nconstruct, which relates more closely to the goals of sociology or anthropology, the \ndisciplines associated with ethnographic methods. Second, the analysis-for-a-purpose \ngoals that characterise applied cognitive psychology are at odds with an apparent \nrequirement for ethnography to be as theoretically and pragmatically neutral as possible. \n In the present paper we suggest how ethnographic methods might be used \nsuccessfully in investigating the interplay between people-laden contexts and expert \ncognition, whilst servicing the basic theoretical and applied goals of cognitive \npsychology. We first consider the nature of ethnography as a research methodology, and \nits possible uses in research on design cognition. In discussing the prospects and \nlimitations of traditional ethnography in the analysis of design, we argue that significant \nproblems reside in its use for goal-directed applied research. The disadvantages of \n\u2018genuine\u2019 ethnography lead us to propose a much more restricted form of cognitive \nethnography for human factors research. A key aim for our paper is to explore the \ndifferences between pure ethnography and the qualified form of cognitive ethnography \nespoused here. We illustrate the value of a cognitive ethnographic approach with \nreference to research that we are currently undertaking, which is aimed at supporting \ninformation re-use in innovative design contexts through intelligent, computer-based \nsupport. \nEthnography as a field research method \nThe ways in which researchers define ethnography are varied and fuzzy. Some equate \nethnography with any method that involves an element of in situ participant observation \n(e.g., Taylor, 1994). For others, the crux of ethnography is not so much its basis in \nparticipant observation but its epistemological  stance, which is firmly located within a \nPutting ethnography to work \n7 \nsocio-cultural frame of reference (e.g., Hutchins, 1995). Although each definition of \nethnography is interesting in its own right, no single definition that we have encountered \ndenotes the full set of necessary and sufficient attributes that define this concept. \n Such difficulties in defining the concept of ethnography lead us to propose that it \nis better understood as a radial category which exhibits prototype effects (see Lakoff, \n1987). Radial categories encompass a central, prototypical case as well as a number of \nvariations from this prototype. In this way, the prototypical case of an ethnographic \nmethod can be viewed as a template against which to compare other, possibly less \ntypical, instances of ethnography. To the extent that any observational method varies \nfrom this prototype (e.g., by omission of one or more attributes) then it is a less central \ncase of the ethnographic technique. Of course, under this conceptualisation, issues \nremain as to how far one can deviate from a central case in order for a method still to be \nreferred to as ethnographic in nature. This is an important concern, which has led to our \nview that at some point of deviation from a central case one has to recognise that a \nmethod may no longer be legitimately referred to as ethnography but must be referred to \nby a different term that acknowledges both its relationship to the central case and its \ndifferences to this prototype. \n Our examination of a range of contemporary overviews of ethnography (e.g., \nTaylor, 1994; Toren, 1996; Rachel, 1996; Baszanger & Dodier, 1997) leads us to suggest \nthat a prototypical case of ethnography would be characterised by the following ten \nfeatures (the order in which these are listed is arbitrary): \n1. Situatedness - Data are collected by a participant observer who is located within the \neveryday context of interest (e.g., a community of practitioners). \n2. Richness - The observer studies behaviour in all manifestations, such that data are \ngathered from a wide range of sources including interviews, team discussions, \nincidental conversations, documents, as well as non-verbal interactions. \n3. Participant Autonomy - The observees are not required to comply in any rigid, pre-\ndetermined study arrangements.  \nPutting ethnography to work \n8 \n4. Openness - The observer remains open to the discovery of novel or unexpected issues \nthat may come to light as a study progresses. \n5. Personalisation - The observer makes a note of their own feelings in relation to \nsituations encountered during data collection and analysis. \n6. Reflexivity - The observer takes a reflective and empathetic stance in striving toward \nan understanding of the observee\u2019s point of view, the observer taking account of, \nrather than striving to eliminate, their own affects upon the behaviour of the \nobservees. \n7. Self-reflection - The observer must acknowledge that any interpretative act is \ninfluenced by the tradition to which they themselves belong. \n8. Intensity - Observations must be intensive and long-term, such that the observer \nshould become immersed in the ongoing culture of the observee's environment.  \n9. Independence - The observer must not be constrained by pre-determined goal-set, \nmind-set or theory. \n10. Historicism - The observer aims to connect observations to a backdrop of historical \nand cultural contingencies. \n These ten characteristics of a prototypical case of ethnography can be used to \nidentify whether a method that has been employed by a researcher is a more or less \ncentral form of the ethnographic technique. For example, Woolgar\u2019s (1995) company-\nbased study of the processes underpinning the design and production of a new range of \nmicrocomputers fits this template very well. Woolgar joined this design project for an \neighteen-month period as a managerial assistant with responsibility for liaison between \ndifferent sections of the company. As such, his status was that of a genuine participant \nobserver with legitimate access across disparate sections of the company to rich, varied \nand situated data, including those deriving from usability trials. Woolgar\u2019s ethnography \nindicates a highly open stance to data acquisition, as exemplified by the multiplicity of \nperspectives sought on the nature of potential end-users of the microcomputer range and \nthe weight that is attributed to unique and unexpected comments and viewpoints. The \nnarrative associated with Woolgar\u2019s \u2018ethnography of computers\u2019 also reveals a reflexive \nPutting ethnography to work \n9 \nand personalised tone with its emphasis on the view that microcomputer design can be \nunderstood as a process of configuring intended users, where the notion of configuring \nsubsumes processes such as setting constraints upon users\u2019 likely future actions. \nWoolgar\u2019s study, then, is very much a prototypical ethnography which reflects the \nbenefits which derive from a prototypical ethnography such as richness of the narrative, \nsocio-cultural grounding, and epistemological relativism. \nThe features of cognitive ethnography  \nThere is no doubt that the application of a prototypical ethnographic method and the \n\u2018thick description\u2019 (Rouncefield, Hughes & O\u2019Brien) that it affords, enables insights that \nwould undoubtedly be missed by methods lacking some of the features outlined above. \nOne cannot easily conceive how Woolgar's (1995) reanalysis of the concept of \u2018users\u2019 \nwould have emerged in the absence of any of the features of a prototypical ethnography.  \nHowever, we are concerned that ethnographic criteria such as our ten-point feature list \nare unlikely to be applied successfully where human factors researchers are goal-directed \nto inform the development of technological artefacts. \n There are three reasons for our concern: First, the intensity of ethnographic data-\nacquisition, which typically revolves around highly resource-intensive participant \nobservation (some ethnographies spanning several years), may not be cost-effective or \neven possible for most projects. Pursuing applied goals such as supporting, assisting or \ntraining aspects of expert cognition typically means that there is a need to acquire an \nunderstanding of skilled behaviours within a relatively short time frame in order to effect \nfacilitatory interventions as quickly as possible. Second, the general lack of verifiability \nof data analysis, which centres around story-telling in relation to people\u2019s historical and \ncultural endowments, presents a major problem. Human factors research (and the \nsystems development it typically leads to) is expensive, and sponsors are quite \nreasonably going to seek reassurance that the design suggestions emerging from \nempirical studies are strongly grounded. Also, commercial systems development projects \nare typically pursuing generalisable technological solutions, such that findings from \nempirical research must be validated across a number of contexts. Third, the \nPutting ethnography to work \n10 \nindependence of ethnographic data necessitates analyses based around gross descriptions \nof collective behaviours in terms of themes of interest rather than the testing of specific \nresearch hypotheses or theoretical concepts. Yet the specification of a technological \nsystem, even at the earliest stages of needs analysis, is (if only tacitly) setting up specific \nhypotheses that the researcher must test.  \nConsequently, we refer to the kinds of method used by ourselves as cognitive \nethnography, which is, in essence, the adoption of a subset of the features of an \nethnographic approach, and the deliberate violation of other features, in the pursuit of \ncognitive research goals. As well as there being a definable research tradition of \ncognitive psychology (and latterly, cognitive science), \u2018cognitive\u2019 has been used \nelsewhere as a qualifier. For example, the term cognitive anthropology is used to define a \ndiscipline of cross-cultural studies of conceptual categories and other cognitive \nphenomena (e.g., D'Andrade, 1990). To attach the qualifier \u2018cognitive\u2019 to a method \nrather than a discipline is less common, and is, as we shall see in the next section, \ndeliberately challenging to generally accepted views of both cognitive and ethnographic \nmethods. It is interesting to note that Hutchins (1995), in the last pages of his monograph \n(p. 371), has dubbed his own approach of describing cognition in culturally constituted \nsettings as \u2018cognitive ethnography\u2019. However, much remains to be done in terms of \ndefining what constitutes a cognitive ethnographic approach to observation, and how it \nmight be used in systems design. \n Our own conception of cognitive ethnography is characterised by three key \nfeatures. First, it relies on small-scale data collection based around representative time \nslices of situated activity. As such, it demonstrates observational specificity, as opposed \nto the intensity of a prototypical ethnography. Second, it is purposive, in that its mode of \nquestioning focuses on issues that are informed by some intention to intervene with, or \nsomehow affect, existing work practices. In some instances, such as the case study that \nwe describe later in the paper, these intentions are inherently cognitive in nature, such as \nunderstanding the interaction between expert designers\u2019 problem solving strategies and \nexternal information repositories (including other designers). Thus, cognitive \nPutting ethnography to work \n11 \nethnography violates the feature of independence (though not, at least in principle, the \nfeature of openness). Third, it places a strong emphasis on verifiability, in terms of \nvalidating observations across observers, data sets and methodologies. As such, it \nchallenges the prototypical ethnographic emphasis on personalisation, and at very least \nrequires the explication of the role played by reflexivity in data capture and analysis. \nCognitive ethnography is especially well suited to addressing applied questions of the \ntype which dominate research on human factors, since it maintains levels of objectivity \nthat enable replication by other observers, as well as the validation of its findings through \na process of methodological triangulation involving experimental methods.  \n A critic might argue that the phrase \u2018cognitive ethnography\u2019 has an oxymoronic \nquality. Many of the features of a pure ethnography are in flagrant violation of basic \ntenets of the dominant paradigm of cognitive experimentation. Notably, one might see \nthe ethnographic features of situatedness, participant autonomy, personalisation, \nreflexivity and independence as implying precisely the converse of a list of features that \ndefine the methods of experimental cognitive psychology, namely reductionism, \nexperimental manipulation, impersonalisation, objectivity, and hypothesis-driven data \nsampling. However, we have already argued that the methods of experimental cognitive \npsychology are not always appropriate for exploring contextually rich multi-agent \ndomains such as design, and that the methods of pure ethnography lack feasibility in the \nhuman factors domain. So to line up the extreme cases against each other in this way \nmakes little sense. The proof of the method of cognitive ethnography, and probably the \nonly sensible response to this linguistically plausible but otherwise vacuous critique, lies \nin the products of an application of the method.  \nDimensions of ethnographies \nThe foregoing description of prototypical and cognitive ethnographies presents a \nspace in which different forms of ethnographic studies can be located.  However, this is \nnot a straightforward process, for two reasons. First, there is no precise parameterisation \nwith which ethnographic approaches can be compared; violations of one feature may be \nmore important than violations of another. Second, there is no single continuum between \nPutting ethnography to work \n12 \nprototypical and cognitive ethnographies. There are likely to be many high-level \ndimensions on which ethnographies differ, of which two, \u2018goal\u2019 and \u2018focus\u2019, are of \ngreatest interest to us.  It is the placement within these dimensions, we suggest, that is the \nprincipal determinant of whether a study embodies features of a prototypical \nethnography. \nThe first dimension ranges from \u2018theoretical' to \u2018applied\u2019, and aims to capture an \nessential aspect of the research goals motivating the ethnographic study. Woolgar\u2019s \nresearch, for example, is primarily directed toward gleaning fundamental theoretical \ninsights into microcomputer design and production processes rather than an \nunderstanding of value for applied work (e.g., supporting the design process through new \ntools or methods). Likewise the seminal work on situated action and distributed \ncognition (e.g., Lave, 1988; Lave, Murtaugh & de la Rocha, 1984; Suchman, 1987; \nGoodwin & Goodwin, 1995; Hutchins, 1995) also appears to have been primarily \nmotivated by the pursuit of theoretical rather than applied goals. Such studies tend to \nmap closely onto the ten features we identify as characterising the radial category of \nprototypical ethnography. By the same token, none of these studies reflects strongly the \nfeatures of purposiveness, specificity and verifiability that we argue characterise \ncognitive ethnography. It might be argued, however, that, to some extent, all studies have \nthese latter features. For example, Hutchins\u2019 (1995) studies of navigation were partly \nsupported by the US Office of Naval Research who presumably had some interest in \nusing the results of his work - thus it had some aspects of purpose. On closer inspection, \nhowever, his work appears to have been mainly guided by a broad requirement to study \nthe richness underlying navigation as a work domain, and not by a pre-planned \nintervention within that work domain. \nSome contemporary researchers have employed more restricted forms of \nethnographic techniques in their field research in pursuit of systems design. For example, \nHughes and colleagues (e.g., Hughes, King, Rodden & Anderson, 1994) have referred to \n\u2018quick and dirty\u2019 or 'lightweight' ethnography as being invaluable in speeding up the \ndelivery of ethnographic results.  They argue that the slow pace of purer forms of \nPutting ethnography to work \n13 \nethnography are incongruous with the needs of commercial designers \u2013 who typically \ndemand rapid results from the fieldworker. Their approach clearly and deliberately goes \nagainst features such as intensity that define a prototypical ethnography. Their studies \nalso exemplify some features of cognitive ethnography. For example, Blythin, \nRouncefield and Hughes (1997) report an ethnographic study to inform changes in \nmanagement practices within a large retail bank - providing a clear demonstration of \npurposiveness. In addition, these researchers are selective in their observational focus. \nFor example, Hughes, O\u2019Brien, Rodden & Rouncefield (1997) suggest that there are \nthree key viewpoints that form the focus of ethnographic analysis for systems design: \nsetting or ecology of work, workflow and social\/organisational viewpoints. These \nviewpoints are specific in that they focus observations towards issues of distributed \ncoordination, plans and procedures and awareness of work. \nWe find the concept of ethnography forwarded by Hughes and colleagues \nappealing in relation to applied research on human factors. We would further argue that \nrecognising the value of impure ethnographic techniques is potentially liberating for \nresearchers, since effort can switch away from attempts to accommodate the \nmethodological edifice implied by the term ethnography toward a focus on developing \nthe strengths of new techniques in field research. For example, Viller and Somerville \n(1997) have explored the potential of UML (Unified Modelling Language) as a notation \nfor communicating the three viewpoints they focus upon in a form amenable to systems \ndesigners. This kind of development demonstrates how a pragmatic focus can advance \nthe utility of an ethnographic approach. \nThe second high-level dimension on which ethnographies differ concerns the \n\u2018focus\u2019 of observation, with extremes placed in individual and social\/organisational \ncontexts. Again, much of the pioneering research on situated action and distributed \ncognition (e.g., Lave, 1988; Suchman, 1987; Hutchins, 1995) clearly fits well with the \nsocial\/organisational focus. Indeed, this work presents strong theoretical arguments \nconcerning the relation between cognition and culture. A key aspect of these arguments, \nexemplified by Hutchins (1995) in his studies of \u2018cognition in the wild\u2019, is the \nPutting ethnography to work \n14 \nestablishment of an opposition between a traditional view of culture as simply affecting \nthe internal cognition of individuals, and a view of cultural activity systems which have \ncognitive properties of their own that differ from those of the individuals who are \nmembers of such systems.  \nResearch on cognitive activity in context has been invaluable in highlighting the \nreal importance of the roles of culture, context and history in human cognition and the \npotential limitations that derive from maintaining a standard epistemology of distributed \ncognition as espoused, for example, by Larkin (1989) and Vera and Simon (1993). For \nexample, the work of Blythin et al (1997) is aimed at developing multi-user systems to \nsupport the social and organisational aspects of banking practices. Thus their focus is \nupon social and organisational work issues, a notion captured neatly by the phrase \n\u2018sociality of work\u2019.  However, a shift towards a social\/organisational focus needs to be \nbalanced by retaining sight of the opposite end of the focus dimension: Few researchers \nwould deny that individual cognitive phenomena exist, or that these are irrelevant to \nsystems design.  To maintain an explicit focus upon individual cognitive phenomena \nwhen adopting rich data collection approaches makes sense when the individual is the \nprime concern. \nFurthermore, we suggest that the greatest value of the 'focus' dimension derives \nfrom comparing observations gleaned from each of the extremes. For example, Hutchins \n(1995) observes how the well known phenomenon of 'confirmation bias' in decision-\nmaking, a tendency to select verifying rather than falsifying observations (e.g., Baron, \n1985), varies according to focus, with some team decision-making contexts showing an \nabsence of the bias compared with some individual contexts. The example we describe \nlater in this paper, of developing an indexing tool for supporting designers' ongoing \nwork, required a focus upon the individual, while capitalising upon the benefits of an \nethnographic approach to observation within a rich and realistic work environment. Like \nHutchins, we provide an example of a well-known cognitive phenomenon, 'satisficing' \n(e.g., Simon, 1969), that is apparent in individual design work but appears to be \n'managed out' of team contexts. What makes the dual focus of cognitive ethnography so \nPutting ethnography to work \n15 \nimportant to us is that the lessons learnt from its application allow the design of artifacts \nsensitive to both individual and social\/organisational issues: We had to know about the \nindividual design context to know what was missing from it, and we had to know about \nthe team design context to know what to add to the tool for supporting designers working \non their own. In the end, the 'surrogate manager' metaphor that we adopted for the \nindexing tool emerged directly from the comparative focus approach of cognitive \nethnography. \nOf the three features that define cognitive ethnography, none of the examples we \nhave considered so far has addressed verifiability. In principle, there is no reason why \nany ethnographic data set cannot be subjected to some form of validation or verification, \nwith varying degrees of objectivity. Indeed, an ethnomethodological stance places \nconsiderable emphasis on processes such as triangulation (e.g., Hammersley & Atkinson, \n1993). Another approach adotped by ethnographers to verify their findings is grounded \ntheorising (e.g. Strauss & Corbin, 1990), in which emergent properties of the data take \non theoretical status and are then subjected to subsequent verification in further data \nanalyses.  Notwithstanding these efforts to validate observations, there is generally less \nemphasis upon verifiability in prototypical ethnography than in traditional cognitive \nmethods used to study work activities. Indeed, features of a prototypical ethnography \nsuch as personalisation, reflexivity and self-reflection described above militate against \nobjective verification. Our notion of cognitive ethnography places great weight upon \nverifiability, in part because, unlike grounded theory approaches, the feature of \npurposiveness places one within a hypothetico-deductive research tradition, of which \nobjective empirical verification is the key. Furthermore, we see great benefits in adopting \nsome of the specific methodologies used in cognitive research to triangulate observations \nmade under an ethnographic method. This cross-method triangulation contrasts with, yet \ncomplements, the within-study data triangulation approaches advocated by \nethnomethodologists. In the next section we overview a project that illustrates the goal \nand focus of a cognitive ethnographic approach, as well as showing how cross-method \nverification can take place. \nPutting ethnography to work \n16 \nSupporting design re-use: A prima facie case for cognitive ethnography \nIn this section we illustrate the use of cognitive ethnography by describing an \ninvestigation aimed at facilitating the re-use of design information. Re-use is the process \nby which previously encountered information such as solution options, problems, trade-\noffs, and evaluative critiques is used by designers in tackling a current problem. On the \nempirical side, there is evidence that previous design concepts and prototypes do get re-\nused extensively in routine design situations which are characterised by relatively well-\ndefined design tasks where known solutions can be re-applied (e.g., Sch\u00f6n, 1988; Gero, \n1990; Maiden & Sutcliffe, 1992; Visser, 1996). Our intuition is that there are at least two \nways in which re-use could benefit designers in more innovative environments. First, the \nre-use or adaptation of existing design concepts, solutions and critiques makes cost-\neffective use of design efforts. Second, if designers know that ideas may be useful to \nfuture projects (even if not implementable immediately), then they may explore design \noptions more fully and creatively. However, little is currently known about the nature, \nextent and efficacy of re-use in innovative design environments, though designers \nfrequently tell us that re-use does not play an important role in innovative design \npractices (this is perhaps not surprising, in that the terms \u2018re-use\u2019 and \u2018innovation\u2019 are \nlinguistically at odds each other). \n We are currently engaged in a three-year project to specify and develop a \ncomputer-based system for indexing re-use information, called DESPERADO (DESign \nProcess Encoding and Retrieval by Agent Designated Objects; Ormerod, Mariani, Ball & \nLambell, in press). The project has two parallel strands. One is empirical, in which \ncognitive ethnography is being employed to investigate the re-use activities of design \ngroups working in large-scale commercial design settings. The other strand is \ncomputational, in which concepts of object-oriented and intelligent agent systems are \nbeing applied in developing DESPERADO. Inherent in the project is the dependence of \nthe computational work upon the outcomes of the empirical work, since our analysis of \nthe literature suggests that previous attempts to foster re-use through technological \nPutting ethnography to work \n17 \nsupport have foundered upon the absence of a proper understanding of the contexts in \nwhich re-use activities occur. \nSelecting the research method \nOur first task was to determine an appropriate method for collecting data. In previous \nresearch, we have used verbal protocol analysis (Ormerod and Ball, 1993; Ball, Evans, \nDennis & Ormerod, 1997) and longitudinal diary studies (Ball, Evans & Dennis, 1994) to \ninvestigate the cognitive processes underlying design problem-solving. Like other \nresearchers (e.g., Guindon, 1990) we have focused upon individual designers, although \nthe tasks undertaken by participants varied from single-session and relatively artificial \ntasks (Ormerod and Ball, 1993) to large-scale realistic tasks carried out over many \nmonths (Ball et al., 1994). These studies revealed a number of phenomena, some of \nwhich we discuss below, that served as the basis for initial speculations about the design \nof DESPERADO. \n Whilst our research findings may appear sufficiently compelling to begin the \nspecification of re-use tools (or at least they were to the sponsors of the DESPERADO \nproject), it remains the case that we have only observed designers on an individual \nparticipant basis. Thus it is not necessarily the case that our observations will scale up to \nthe operation of multi-participant design teams. The highly context-bound nature of \nproblem-solving in design ultimately appears to derive from the sheer magnitude and \ncomplexity of modern technological design tasks (e.g., jet engine design, \ntelecommunications design) together with the vast scale of the cost\/benefit ratio \nassociated with success or failure. What such factors mean in practice is that \ntechnological design activity typically takes place in well-resourced companies where \nmultiple agents (both people and computer systems) work collaboratively on an artefact \ndesign task in a divide-and-conquer fashion. Within any company, design activity is \ntypically guided by local organisational goals and managerial structures. Rejection of \ncognitive methods in favour of a form of ethnographic research method reflects the \ncontext-bound nature of the domain.  \nPutting ethnography to work \n18 \n A pure form of ethnography was also deemed inappropriate, for the reasons \noutlined above. Notably, the principle aim of specifying an artefact made our data \ncollection purposive from the outset. Also, the fact that DESPERADO had to meet the \nneeds of many end-user companies meant that we had to capture high level generalities \nin re-use activities where apparent, as well as identifying company- or team-specific \npractices. Perhaps most importantly, we needed to be able to convince our sponsors, and \nmore particularly the intended users, that we had strong theoretical grounds on which to \ndevelop the tool and an unambiguous way of evaluating its effects upon design team \nperformance (or at very least, of ensuring that the tool does not do more harm than \ngood). These considerations placed a strong emphasis upon the verifiability of our data.  \n The purposive nature of our data collection meant that it was necessary to \ndetermine, at least at in a general sense, the types of data that we were to collect in the \nstudies. Specifying the data to be collected before beginning an observational study runs \ncounter to a number of features of a prototypical ethnography, notably intensity, \nindependence and to a certain extent, richness. Yet it was obvious to us that it was \nappropriate, if not essential, to do so in this project. For example, we had limited access, \npartly through company-imposed limitations (e.g., access to designers \u2018off-task\u2019; \nprotection of copyright, and in one case the official secrets act, preventing access to all \ninformation sources). Also, we had to collect and analyse sufficient data within one year \nto complete the specification and prototyping of DESPERADO within three years. Thus, \nwe had to be certain prior to commencement of the project that we could gain sufficient \ndata to inform system design. Therefore, specificity of data collection was considered \nessential. \nDetermining the data to be collected \nIn proposing the construction of DESPERADO, we were driven initially by theoretical \nconsiderations deriving from previous cognitive research. For example, there is evidence \nfor satisficing in the selection and evaluation of putative solution options. Individual \ndesigners frequently become fixated upon single solution ideas (usually derived from \nprior experience) rather than exploring alternatives in order to optimise choices (e.g., \nPutting ethnography to work \n19 \nUllman, Dietterich & Stauffer, 1988), even when they recognise that the solutions are \nless than satisfactory (Ball , Evans, & Dennis, 1994; Ball, Maskill & Ormerod, 1998). To \naddress the problem of satisficing, Ball et al. (1994) argue that a system for promoting \nthe retrieval of re-use information needs to facilitate the active consideration of \nalternative design solutions. A key aspect of this solution would be to provide a \nmechanism for system-initiated decisions (perhaps using intelligent agent technology; \ne.g., Shoham, 1993) as to what, when, and from where, to retrieve during an ongoing \ndesign process. \n Data collection was also motivated by pragmatic considerations emerging from \nour own task analysis of the design process and also from previous experience of design \nre-use projects. A major problem in re-use relates to the encoding of design information. \nHandling the sheer mass and complexity of project information is often seen as \nprohibitively wasteful of designers\u2019 time (Conklin & Burgess-Yakemovic, 1991). Also, \nunless documentation about the limitations of previous designs is accessible, there is a \nrisk that using old solutions can perpetuate sub-optimal designs. In overcoming such \ndifficulties, DESPERADO should be able to assign labels to design information that \ndefine its nature and potential utility in a rich and multi-faceted manner. Thus, the \ndevelopment of a \u2018coding scheme\u2019 for labelling re-use information was a critical \nobjective of the project. \n A promising approach to defining design information classes, and one we adopted \nas a starting point for our coding scheme, is MacLean, Young, Bellotti and Moran's \n(1991) Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) formalism for design rationale. Questions  \ndescribe key design issues, Options  describe possible solutions to design problems, and \nCriteria describe approaches to assessing options. MacLean et al. found considerable \noverlap between the designers\u2019 discourse and the QOC concepts, though recent usability \nanalyses of QOC have suggested extensions to the notational vocabulary (e.g., \nBuckingham Shum, 1996). It is noteworthy, however, that QOC research has \nconcentrated on designers working within highly artificially-constrained design \nsituations. Our task analysis of design re-use indicates that at least one level of notation \nPutting ethnography to work \n20 \nbelow QOC would be required to index design information in a re-usable way. However, \ndetermining a re-use coding scheme remains an empirical question that can only be \nanswered through in-depth studies in fully dynamic and situated environments. \n A second pragmatic consideration was the need to capture data from previous and \nongoing projects in each of our end-user companies that could \u2018seed\u2019 DESPERADO.  \nWe regarded stocking the tool with re-use information appropriate for each of our end-\nuser companies as vital, both to enable empirical evaluation of the tool, and also to \nsecure its acceptance by its intended users, since we were aware that in imposing yet \nanother technology upon designers we had to offer added value from the start, which \nwould be missing in a tool that contained no re-useable data. \n These theoretical and pragmatic considerations led us to use cognitive \nethnography to collect data that address three key objectives: \ni.  Identifying the data of re-use: Here we are seeking answers to the questions \"What \nkinds of information are re-used?\" and \"What information that does not appear to be \nre-used currently might be amenable to re-use\"? One specific outcome is to identify \nthe most useful unit of re-use (subsequently referred to as an \u2018episode\u2019). A secondary \noutcome is to collect a set of episodes for seeding the re-use tool. \nii.  Exploring natural re-use: Here we are pursuing the questions \"How do designers \nencode information for subsequent re-use?\" and \"How and when do designers \nretrieve information for re-use?\" One outcome is to use evidence of existing re-use \npractices inform the development of a coding scheme. A further outcome is to \nattempt to extract regularities in natural re-use practices to inform the development of \nsystem-initiated retrieval. \niii. Situating re-use in existing design practices: The question here is \"What happens in \nthe design process when re-use occurs?\" For example, we need to investigate whether \nphenomena evident when we study individual designers, such as satisficing, are also \nshown in team design contexts. \nAs a consequence of these objectives, we adopted a deliberately constrained view of the \ndata to be collected from the outset. \nPutting ethnography to work \n21 \nApplying the cognitive ethnographic method  \nIn order to collect data that address these objectives, we carried out a short observational \nstudy at each of our four end-user companies, all major international leaders in their own \nfields of telecommunications, computer systems, aerospace and industrial design. Prior \nto each study, we held a series of meetings (three or four one-hour sessions over the \ncourse of a six-month period) with the managers and selected members (as determined \nby the end-user groups) of each design team, in order to set up the studies. This phase \nwas basically a process of capturing background information to familiarise ourselves \nwith the design domain of each end-user group as well as negotiating the terms under \nwhich, and when, our researcher could observe each group. \n Our researchers spent between two and four weeks with each targeted design \ngroup, one researcher per group, and two researchers associated with the project. In each \ngroup, the researcher was a 'semi-participant' observer, in that he or she did not \ncontribute to the design work of the teams directly but was frequently involved in design \ndiscussions, often acting as a sounding board, sometimes even offering advice, opinions \nand informal evaluations of design options. The researcher was given a desk in the main \ndesign room of each team (most teams were based in open-plan offices, with only \nminimal physical divisions between individual designer\u2019s desks), and was, generally \nspeaking, allowed to observe the work of individual designers and sit in upon design \nteam meetings whenever she wished, unless designers asked the researcher to withdraw \nor withheld documents from view (a relatively rare occurrence as it turned out). The \nresearcher also conducted informal and unstructured interviews with design team \nmembers, usually on a one-to-one basis, though occasionally with two or more designers.  \n Data collection consisted of recordings (by audiotape or videotape where \npossible) of conversations, interviews and meetings, and field notes that detailed the \nactivities observed by the researcher along with documentation (e.g., company standards, \nmemos, design briefs, drawings and notes). These data were complemented by notes \ndetailing the researcher\u2019s comments upon, and attitudes towards, the events and contexts \nPutting ethnography to work \n22 \nthat were experienced1. In total, the researchers collected around 150 hours of audio-and \nvideotape data, along with 100 or so pages of field notes. Even with selective data \ngathering such as this, the data set is extremely large (a year later we are still completing \nour analyses). \nSome highlights of the resulting data \nPartly because of the sheer quantity of data and the limited length of this article, the \nreview of research findings presented here is necessarily selective. We focus upon how \nthe outcomes of the cognitive ethnography informed our three key objectives outlined \nabove. \n i. Identifying the data of re-use: We began our analysis by using the QOC scheme \n(MacLean et al., 1991) to guide the sectioning of data into re-use \u2018episodes\u2019. In this \nsense, our analysis was driven by the goal of identifying the nature and size of the \n\u2018chunk\u2019 of a re-use information appropriate for handling within DESPERADO. \nIt turned out from inspection of the transcripts and discussion with the researcher \nthat shifts in question focus were an apparently natural transition point between episodes. \nThe size of episode did vary both within and between companies. For example, data from \nthe telecommunications and industrial design groups indicate much longer episodes than \ndata from the aerospace group.  This may in part reflect the different types of design \nwork focused upon in each company (e.g., review-meetings and focused team design \nwork versus individual or incidental collaborative), but it is also representative of the \nkinds of design activity that the groups were typically involved in (notably the scale of \nquestions pursued by each design group). The sectioning of episode by question also, \nperhaps fortuitously, gave us a manageable chunk size for indexing re-use information. \nFor example, two weeks of data collection from the aerospace company gave us 50 \nepisodes that have subsequently been used to seed the DESPERADO database for that \ncompany. \n                                                 \n1For example, the field notes taken from one company made frequent reference to the 'Nomad',  \nan evocative name given by the researcher to an individual who seemed to spend his time \nwandering around the design group without any specific role or agenda, and whose influence \nupon design activities was not always welcomed by other members of the design team. \nPutting ethnography to work \n23 \n In order to investigate the validity of the \u2018episode by question\u2019 notion further, the \nsecond author and one of the researchers carried out independent sectioning by question \nof episodes taken from the first week of the study at the aerospace group. The grain size \nof episodes was surprisingly similar (TO\u2019s mean episode length = 151words; The \nresearcher\u2019s mean episode length = 150 words). The variance of the two sets of values \nwas also very similar. There was remarkable correspondence between the episodes that \nboth coders identified. However, TO\u2019s sectioning revealed twice as many episodes (34) \ncompared with the researcher\u2019s (17), and 18 of TO\u2019s episodes were not identified as \nepisodes by the researcher. Close scrutiny of these 18 episodes suggests that they do not \nreally convey design work as such, but are instances of designers presenting background \ninformation to the researcher in order to furnish her with an understanding of the \nproject\u2019s aims and context etc.  This provides an interesting illustration of the value of an \nethnographic approach to the analysis of the data: in essence, a participant observer has a \ncloser relationship to the data than an independent observer, and is better placed to \ninterpret the significance of emerging observations. As a consequence, the final \nsectioning of data into episodes was based mainly upon episodes that were recognised by \nboth a researcher and one of the authors. There were very few instances in the data where \nthe researcher recognised an episode that was not identified by one of the authors. Once \nepisodes were identified, they were coded in order to identify the focus of design work \nadopted by the individual designer. The scheme consisted of a set of codes that identify \nfunctional, structural, procedural and optimisation-oriented views. The coding of \nepisodes under this scheme is illustrated in Figure 1. \n--------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n--------------------------------------- \n  \nWe then met to review the episodes in order to develop a second coding scheme \nfor capturing the contextual nature of each episode. Figure 2 shows an example of an \nepisode coded under this context-oriented scheme. The role of the researchers was \nPutting ethnography to work \n24 \ncentral to the development of the scheme, since they were able to provide insights into \nthe nature of design practices that were not available to the authors. For example, whilst \nthe authors noted that episodes tended to have particular players (individuals or groups of \ndesigners) associated with them, the researchers were able to point out important \ndistinctions in the roles of different players. In particular, some participants are identified \nas \u2018owners\u2019 of the particular project that an episode concerns. In the aerospace group, \n\u2018ownership\u2019 is an explicit managerial practice intended to foster the maintenance of \nproject information and skill over time. In essence, the project owner is the principal \nsource of information about that project within the company, and has responsibility for \nmaintaining knowledge about the project both during and after project completion.  \nIn the industrial design group, there appeared to be tacit use of the ownership \nnotion, in that each project had an individual who was recognised by other designers as \nthe \u2018project champion\u2019, who carried with him or her the knowledge base necessary to \nguide the project, and who appeared to the researchers to be \u2018carrying the torch\u2019 for a \nparticular project. We are currently in the process of identifying and validating further \nplayer roles that appear to be important (e.g., there is evidence in one company for the \nadoption of a \u2018devil's advocate\u2019 by one or more players in any collaborative setting, \nwhose self-selected role seems to be to critique the work of others: we are examining \ntranscripts from other companies to establish whether this is a general pattern in design \ngroups or whether it is particular to this company). \n--------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 2 about here \n--------------------------------------- \n Our analysis to date has provided us with a coding scheme that has two main \ntypes of category. The first is a set of categories that describe the data of each episode \n(the players, the project names and types, the components, artefacts and tools that are \ndiscussed, and the antecedent and consequent episodes associated with the current \nepisode).  These categories are generally speaking explicit in the episode transcripts. The \nsecond set of categories is orthogonal descriptions that capture aspects of design activity.  \nPutting ethnography to work \n25 \nThese include the stage (e.g., requirements specification, conceptual design, detailed \ndesign, etc.), process (e.g., the generation, evaluation and simulation of putative solution \noptions or critiques) and scope (e.g., project-specific, general to design practices, \norganisational, managerial, company policy-related, etc.) of each episode.  \nOur application of the coding scheme also revealed that each episode contained a \nconstellation of options and criteria associated with each question. For example, in the \naerospace data, 64% of the episodes contain at least one option and criterion associated \nwith the episode question, there were two episodes in which a criterion was examined in \nthe absence of any design options, but there were no episodes in which options were \ndiscussed in the absence of criteria. \n ii. Exploring natural re-use: Each of the four companies had in place a number of \nexisting central information repositories, such as paper-based archives, computer-based \nCAD (computer-aided design) databases and diary-based file stores. Despite the \nexistence of these repositories, in addressing the question \"How do designers encode \ninformation for subsequent re-use?\" we were surprised to see little evidence of \nsystematic encoding of design information. Storage was typically left to the \u2018owners\u2019 of \neach project, who tended to place only a sample of official documents (e.g., requirements \nspecifications, tenders, CAD drawings) in shared repositories, the majority of \ndocumentation being held in individual designer's computers and filing cabinets. \nInformation was typically encoded (i.e. labelled) in a piecemeal fashion, with file names \ngenerally specifying either the players, project names, components under design, the \ndate, or some combination of these categories. There was no evidence of encoding by \nprocess (i.e., of a sort captured by our orthogonal categories) or by focus (i.e., the QOC \ncategories). \n The absence of systematic encoding practices was, in our evaluation, reflected in \nthe ways, and the extent to which, information was retrieved for re-use. The extent to \nwhich information repositories in the companies were used successfully was extremely \nvariable, though the overall evaluation of the systems (not only by ourselves but more \nimportantly by designers and design group managers who used the systems) emerging \nPutting ethnography to work \n26 \nfrom our studies is that they failed to support systematic and optimal information re-use.  \nFor example, one company had installed a project management system based around a \ncomputer-networked diary, which automatically created folders in a project file hierarchy \nfor designers to deposit project-related information. In demonstrating the system to our \nresearcher, the team manager was unable to find a single folder that had any contents, \ndespite the fact that the system had been running for two years prior to our visit. It \nbecame clear, from subsequent conversations with members of the design team, that they \nmaintained their own information repositories, only occasionally shifting files to the \ndesignated project folders immediately prior to team meetings. In another example, the \nresearcher observed one designer engaging in a week-long search for a specific piece of \ndesign information. It took him a day to locate the \u2018owner\u2019 of the project to which the \ninformation pertained, and a further two days to find that this individual had in fact \nretired from the company some years ago, taking with him the knowledge of how to \nretrieve the information sought by the designer (though he was sure that is was held \n\"somewhere in the central files of the group\"). These examples are extreme, though they \nillustrate a tendency among the designers to place little reliance on retrieval from central \nrepositories. \n Despite the limited evidence for successful encoding and retrieval using the \ncentral repositories, there was strong evidence for the frequent re-use (or attempted re-\nuse) of design information from past projects to inform ongoing work. Two main classes \nof re-use activity were observed: the first, and most common one, was for individual \ndesigners to recall from memory previous work in which they were involved or \ncomponents and solution options (and very occasionally, critiques) that they had \nexperience of. The second class of re-use was essentially managerial, in that design team \nmanagers were often observed making suggestions, either to individuals or during team \nmeetings, as to what kinds of information designers might seek to solve particular \nproblems as well as suggested ways of locating relevant information. \n iii. Situating re-use in existing design practices: A key issue motivating our \ncognitive ethnography was to understand the extent and consequences of sub-optimal re-\nPutting ethnography to work \n27 \nuse strategies such as satisficing. The results are surprising in the degree to which they \ncontrast so markedly with our previous studies of individual and de-contextualised \ndesigners (e.g., Ball et al., 1998). Almost all episodes appear to reflect a motivated \nattempt by designers to generate and evaluate multiple solutions options (albeit ones \ntypically stemming from their own memories) with the aim of maximising the choice of \na best alternative in relation to a particular design question. The evaluation of design \noptions frequently takes the form of sophisticated trade-off analyses, with options being \nsystematically pitted against each other in terms of key design criteria. Importantly, too, \nthis evidence for optimising attempts at multiple solution search and evaluation is a \nfinding that generalises across the different companies we researched and the diverse \ndesign tasks that were being tackled within these companies. \n The prevalence of highly effective search and evaluation strategies in these \ncompanies, coupled with evidence for less effective strategies in de-contextualised \nindividuals, suggests that re-use behaviours may be closely determined by the aspects of \nthe context in which design work is occurring. For example, a major  function of design \nreview meetings was for the design team to explore and critically appraise a range of \nalternative design concepts in an in-depth manner. Indeed, the team dynamics are highly \ntuned toward explicating novel design options, new evaluation criteria, unconsidered \ndesign constraints and the like. Quite significantly, too, some more experienced project \nchampions appear to enter the design review meeting well armed with a range of \nalternative design options for discussion together with detailed knowledge of their \nassociated costs and benefits. This kind of pre-emptive approach to design review \nappears to be a sophisticated strategy aimed at dealing effectively with the penetrating \nquestions that arise form those adopting the devil\u2019s advocate role within the team. \n A final and striking feature of the team dynamics is the role played by the team \nmanager as a safeguard against premature commitment to single solution options should \neither the project champion or the group of collaborating designers become overly \nfixated upon a particular idea or concept prior to a full and cautious exploration of viable \nalternatives. It appears that the team manager has a very clear and explicit notion of the \nPutting ethnography to work \n28 \nimportance of ensuring multiple solution search and evaluation such that they are seen to \nperform an important steering function when designers get fixated upon single or \nunsatisfactory solution ideas or need support in pursuing alternatives. So, for example, in \none team design session, where a project champion is describing the unsatisfactory \naspects of a solution that they are actually quite committed to, the team manager \ninterjects to say \u201cI think the thing to do is look at all the other options\u201d. This simple \ninterjection is particularly striking as it is only the third statement that the manager has \nmade in the first 30 minutes or so of the team design session and it therefore appears to \ncarry considerable weight. Another example, from a different company, again relates to a \nsituation where a member of the design team is beginning to become overly fixated upon \nthe negative aspects of one solution option that has been suggested. The project manager \nstrives to re-inforce the need to explore fully the available options by saying \u2018I think we \nwould be mistaken if we assumed it was one or other answer . . . I think we agreed in the \nlast meeting to look at the two extremes\u2019. This seems to be sound advice given that the \nteam is in the very early, conceptual stages of the design process where options need to \nbe fully explored. \nVerifying the outcomes of the ethnography \nThe preceding description demonstrates the purposive and specific nature of data \ncollection in cognitive ethnography. The third aspect, verifiability, is a critical part of \ncognitive ethnography, since it is only possible to gain the confidence of clients and \ninvestors by being able to demonstrate that ones 'story' has some degree of objectivity, \nubiquity and salience. In our study, we undertook three approaches to verifying our \nobservations: first, the application of a coding scheme to the data for cross-\ncompany\/session comparisons (as illustrated in Figure 2); second, the embodiment and \nevaluation of observations in a computer-based system (as described in Ormerod et al., \nin press), and third, comparisons of empirical outcomes across cognitive and \nethnographic methods. We focus here upon the third, since the mixing of research \nmethods across what are generally seen as radically different, even antagonistic, \nPutting ethnography to work \n29 \nresearch traditions provides what we believe is one of the most useful features of \ncognitive ethnography.  \nThe combination of ethnographic approaches with traditional controlled methods \nof cognitive psychology for verifying findings is illustrated by a study carried out with \nthe team of software designers described earlier (Ormerod, Rummer & Ball, in press). \nThey took the coded data from the ethnographic study conducted in this company, and \nisolated sets of design episodes. These were subsequently used as materials for a study \nusing a sort methodology (e.g., Hoffman, Shadbolt, Burton & Klein, 1995). The \ndesigners categorised the episodes into natural categories that grouped them in ways that \nwere personally meaningful. The aims of the study were, first, to inform the \ndevelopment of the indexing system by eliciting a set of episode categories, and second, \nto triangulate observations made in the ethnographic data, both at this company and at \nother sites. Analysis of the data (using cluster analysis and multiple regression) revealed \nthree key results. First, there was a remarkable degree of consistency amongst \nparticipants in category generation and assignment.  Second, this consistency was \nachieved largely because designers used an impoverished set of dimensions for \ncategorisation (classifying episodes by artifact, stage, design task and marketing issue). \nThird, the order in which categories are generated is related to the role of the designer in \nthe team (e.g., manager, product champion, and implementor). The study is novel, in \nthat it is the first we are aware of in which participants categorise materials they \nthemselves have produced. It also provides an objective verification for many of our \nobservations drawn from the ethnographic data. \nConclusions \nIn this paper we have argued for a limited, yet definable, use of ethnographic methods for \nhuman factors research, which is distinguished from pure ethnography in terms of \nPutting ethnography to work \n30 \npurposiveness, verifiability and observational specificity. On the basis of the analyses we \nconducted, we have drawn up a requirements specification and have programmed a \nprototype interface for the DESPERADO indexing tool. In particular, our use of \ncognitive ethnography has informed the development of an episode model that provides a \nmetaphor for the systematic encoding of design information, and has enabled the \nelicitation and validation of a coding scheme for labelling information for subsequent re-\nuse that captures both natural re-use based upon recall from memory of project data-\nrelated aspects, and also the prescriptively optimal yet less apparently natural retrieval \nthrough application of process-oriented retrieval rules. Our next step is take the prototype \ntool to the design groups and allow them to test and critique the tool. We are confident \nthat we have got much further in systems design than a full-blown ethnographic study \nwould have allowed in the same timescale.  \n There are a number of issues which space precludes us from addressing in which \nthe notion of cognitive ethnography might be critiqued. For example, although our \nresearchers were to some extent participant observers, their role was nonetheless \nrelatively neutral with respect to the design teams that they observed. This can be \ncontrasted with the view taken by some proponents that a pure ethnography requires the \nintegration of the researcher into the group under study. It was clearly not possible for \nour researchers to become integrated into the design teams, since all the designers were \nhighly qualified and experienced specialists in their own fields, and it was clearly not \nfeasible for us to train our researchers to a level of competence in each design domain.  \nIndeed, even acquiring sufficient knowledge to understand the basic aspects of each \ndesign domain was in itself a challenging task which took at least three weeks for each \ncompany studied.  \n  The fact that we chose to study four companies for short periods of time rather \nthan, say, one company for a more extensive period might be questioned by some \nethnographers. However, as well as providing data that inform the development of more \ngeneral support tools than would be allowed by studying only a single company's \npractices, the cross-company comparisons that our data allowed also gave us a way of \nPutting ethnography to work \n31 \nverifying the outcomes from each study. Ethnographers might argue that their \nobservations achieve some validation by their recurrence, and that anyway some of the \nmost significant and informative outcomes of an ethnographic analysis are the non-\nrecurring and distinctive behaviours that are observed. However, it is clear to us that both \nour sponsors, and perhaps more importantly the companies themselves, would be more \nconvinced by findings that can be verified in to some degree of objectivity. This is \nparticularly important given that we are proposing to impose upon designers another \ninformation handling tool despite the evidence that they see of the failures of existing \ninformation repositories. \n Whilst our notion of cognitive ethnography is cognitivist in its orientation, the \nuse of the technique also affords the advantages offered by adopting an ethnographic \nstance. Indeed, cognitive psychologists and systems designers should be confident in \nadding ethnography to their repertoire of techniques. For example, an important finding \nthat demonstrates the advantages of the use of the method over more traditional cognitive \nmethods for human factors research is the evidence for systematic design practices that \navoid problems shown by individual designers working in de-contextualised studies. The \nstudy of complex human activity in general, and human factors in particular, is littered \nwith arguments, and in our opinion false dichotomies, concerning the validity of different \nresearch methodologies. We offer cognitive ethnography as an initial attempt at a \nrapprochement between ethnographic and cognitive methods, in the hope that a \ndemonstration of combining the strengths from each approach can be made.  \n \nPutting ethnography to work \n32 \nReferences \nBALL, L.J., EVANS, J.St.B.T., & DENNIS, I.

An economic study of the new \n266 engine concept has been undertaken, and has come up against problems involving \nthe development of the new engine versus scaling an old engine. The study also worked \nout figures to do with performance capabilities and forecasted changes in market \nrequirements. The new figures from the study mean that some tweaking of the \nperformance requirements is needed, and some compressor work needs to be done with \nthe new parameters. There are limited resources within the compressor group, which \nmeans that they will have to concentrate their efforts on the military application rather \nthan the civil. The different applications of technology also means that there are \ndifferences in stress levels within the engine. The normal civil application has a lower \nstress level than the civil\/military dual application. However, the new combined engine \nPutting ethnography to work \n41 \nhas technology standard to a previously defined engine.
