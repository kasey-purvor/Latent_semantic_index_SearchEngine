Morphological features, on the other hand, \ncharacterize variations in form which are independent of syntactic context. It is easy to \nimagine a language in which every morphosyntactic value had a unique realization. We \nmight consider such a system of inflectional morphology to be canonical. Such a system \nwould have no need for morphological features. The fact that we find so many instances \nthat deviate from this canonical situation (allomorphy and syncretism), means that \nadditional machinery is required. It is to meet this need that various sorts of \nmorphological features have been proposed. For example, we may find items of the same \nclass which realize just the same morphosyntactic values but with rather different \nphonological material. On this basis we recognise different inflectional classes.  \n If we need to accept such inflectional classes, we do not expect to find rules of the \ntype: \n*verbs which conjugate according to inflectional class II take a preceding \ndirect object; others take a following direct object \n \nThis intuition is made explicit in the principle of \u2018morphology-free syntax\u2019 (Zwicky \n1996: 301). We explore this widely held principle in a case study (\u00a72). A consequence of \nthe principle is that we must distinguish features concerned with purely morphological \nphenomena (such as inflectional class) from morphosyntactic features (\u00a73). Since \nmorphological features have been often assumed but little studied, we offer an outline \ntypology (\u00a74). We then consider how morphological features may be distinguished (\u00a75), \nand review the case for distinguishing them as a separate type of feature (\u00a76). It is worth \nstating here, in advance of the conclusion, that there have been various attempts to avoid \nthe use of morphological features. Those which have relied instead on phonology have \nproved unsuccessful. More recent attempts have been vague suggestions, lacking a \n                                                 \n\u2217\n The support of the ESRC under grant RES-051-27-0122 and of the AHRC under grant \nAH\/D001579\/1 is gratefully acknowledged. We are grateful to Greg Stump and Matthew \nDryer for helpful discussion of the issues addressed.

We are also grateful to three anonymous referees for \nhelpful suggestions. \n 2 \nworking version which can be assessed. Whatever the outcome of these suggestions, the \nphenomena modelled using morphological features have to be addressed in any serious \ntheory of inflectional morphology. A key point is that we find cross-cutting \nsubregularities (as with inflectional classes and prosodic classes which do not coincide). \nThe speaker\u2019s knowledge of these subregularities, as shown for instance in the \nassignment of new items, has to be modelled in some way, whether through the use of \nmorphological features, or through some equivalent notion.  \n \n2 Illustrative case study \n \nIt has been claimed that in Serbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian, gender resolution can operate in \npart according to the inflectional class (rather than the gender) of the nouns heading the \nconjuncts (Gudkov 1965: 174). It is worth reviewing this example since the data are \ninteresting and fairly convincing, the claim made was reasonable and was repeated in \ndifferent places in the literature, so that there is the initial sense that the analysis is \nreasonable and yet it cannot be right. \n \nSerbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian has four major inflectional classes for nouns, each comprising \nat least a few thousand nouns. They cover seven cases and two numbers, though with \nnumerous syncretisms (see Browne 1993: 319-323).1 There are three genders: masculine, \nfeminine and neuter. Assignment is first by the semantic criterion, namely that for sex-\ndifferentiables, males are masculine (mu\u017e \u2018husband\u2019 and sluga \u2018manservant) and females \nare feminine (\u017eena \u2018woman, wife\u2019 and mati \u2018mother\u2019). For the huge majority of the \nresidue, nouns belonging to the same inflectional class as prozor \u2018window\u2019 are \nmasculine; those in two classes, the du\u0161a \u2018soul\u2019 type and the kost \u2018bone\u2019 type, are \nfeminine, and those of the jezero \u2018lake\u2019 type are neuter. From an analytical perspective, \nthe gender of the nouns is determined by the agreements they take (thus du\u0161a \u2018soul\u2019 and \nkost \u2018bone\u2019 take the same forms of agreement targets). Conversely, the requirement to \nestablish the gender of the nouns is in order to set up adequate rules of syntax.  \n \nThe particular issue of interest is gender resolution. When noun phrases are conjoined, \nthe basic rules are:2 \n1. if all conjuncts are feminine, the resolved form is feminine; \n2. in all other instances the resolved form is masculine.  \n \nThus the masculine is used if we have feminine conjoined with neuter, or even for neuter \nconjoined with neuter. Examination of texts and work with consultants has produced \nlarge numbers of instances confirming the rules as stated above. However, Gudkov \n                                                 \n1\n These inflectional classes are similar in overall outline to those of Russian to be \ndiscussed in \u00a74.1.1 below.  \n2\n Subsequent research showed that the picture is actually more complex (see references at \nthe end of \u00a72), but these rules are an appropriate context for the original analysis to be \ndiscussed. Similar rules are found in the most closely related language, namely Slovene \n(Len\u010dek 1972). \n 3 \n(1965) found examples of masculine being used as the resolved form, even though all the \nconjuncts were headed by feminine nouns. His examples were mainly of this type: \n \n(1) Vre\u00f1a-l-i su ga nebrig-a i \n Offend-PST-PL.M AUX.3PL 3SG.ACC carelessness(F)-SG and \n  lakomislenost Tahir-beg-ov-a. \n capriciousness(F)[SG] Tahir-beg-POSS-F.SG \n \u2018Tahir-beg\u2019s carelessness and capriciousness offended him.\u2019  \n (Andri\u0107, Travni\u010dka Hronika; cited in Corbett 1991: 301) \n \nBoth conjuncts are headed by nouns which are feminine, yet there is masculine \nagreement. However, one of them (lakomislenost \u2018capriciousness\u2019) is of the smaller \ninflectional class of feminines, the kost \u2018bone\u2019 type, and according to Gudkov it is this \nwhich allowed for masculine agreement (we also find many similar examples with \nfeminine agreement, as we would have expected). In (1) the inflectional types are mixed. \nGudkov also found an example, with just nouns of the kost \u2018bone\u2019 type, again with \nmasculine agreement (and we have found further such examples). Gudkov suggested that \nif all the conjuncts are feminine, and they include one headed by a noun of the kost \n\u2018bone\u2019 type, then masculine agreement is possible. Such a finding is somewhat unsettling, \nsince it implies that a syntactic rule can refer to the inflectional class of items. Rather \nthan referring to the nouns\u2019 gender, as a normal agreement rule should, we have an \nalleged case of a rule referring to inflectional class. \n \nGudkov himself added another piece to the jigsaw. In a later paper (Gudkov 1974: 61) he \npointed out that even if all conjuncts are headed by nouns of the -a declension (the du\u0161a \n\u2018soul\u2019 type), there are occasional instances of masculine agreement: \n \n(2) \u0161tul-a i \u0161tak-a bi-l-i su sve \u0161to \n wooden.leg(F)-SG and crutch(F)-SG be.PST-PL.M AUX.3PL all that \n  je tada\u0161nja medicina mogla da mu pru\u017ei. \n  AUX.3SG of.that.time medicine could that 3SG.DAT offer \n  \u2018A wooden leg and a crutch were all that medical science of that time could offer \nhim.\u2019 (M. Popovi\u0107, Vuk St. Kara\u00f1i\u0107) \n \nSuch examples are rare, but they occur, as this example of ours also shows:  \n (3) \u017dustrin-a sa koj-om je pisao i lako\u0107-a \n Speed(F)-SG with which-F.SG.INS AUX.3SG write-PST.3SG.M and ease(F)-SG \n  sa koj-om je nalazi-o re\u010d-i i \n  with which-F.SG.INS AUX.3SG find-PST.3SG.M word-PL and \n  pore\u00f1enj-a zagreja-l-i su ga, i \n  comparison-PL warmed-PST-M.PL AUX.3PL 3SG.M.ACC and \n  konzul oseti ne\u0161to kao olak\u0161anje.  \n  consul feel[AOR.3SG] something like relief \n  \u2018The speed with which he wrote and the ease with which he found words and \ncomparisons encouraged him, and the consul felt a kind of relief.\u2019  \n  (Andri\u0107, Travni\u010dka Hronika) \n 4 \n \nThe next important piece of evidence is that in all the examples with feminine conjuncts \nbut masculine agreement, the noun phrases denote inanimates. None of the examples we \nhave found, in texts or in the literature on the topic, have masculine agreement with \nfeminine nouns denoting persons. Thus the condition is a semantic one: if all conjuncts \nrefer to females, the feminine must be used; if not, both masculine and feminine \nagreement are possible if all conjuncts are headed by feminine nouns.  \n \nWe are still not clear of the problem of morphology intruding into syntax. We must still \nconsider why the majority of examples with feminine conjuncts and masculine \nagreements involve a noun of the kost \u2018bone\u2019 type. A solution was offered in Corbett \n(1991: 302-303). The inflectional class of noun inflecting like kost \u2018bone\u2019 includes a \nsubstantial number of abstract nouns, and very few animates. In real examples of \nconjoined noun phrases the vast majority have conjuncts which are consistent in semantic \nterms: they are all animate or all inanimate. Putting these two points together, it follows \nthat when a feminine noun of the kost \u2018bone\u2019 type is one of the conjuncts then other \nconjuncts will normally be inanimate too. For such situations the use of the feminine \nagreement form will have no semantic justification (unlike its use with animate conjuncts \nwhich denote females). It appears that the gender resolution rules of \nSerbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian are increasingly determined by semantic considerations. For \nfurther discussion of resolution in Serbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian see Leko (1986: 220-243), \nWechsler and Zlati\u0107 (2003: 171-195) and Corbett (2006: 262). Thus what is relevant is \nthe semantic distribution of the nouns over the inflectional classes. There is no need for a \nsyntactic rule to refer to the inflectional class of the nouns. 3 And for most readers that \nwill come as a relief.4 \n                                                 \n3\n For more discussion of this particular distinction, namely morphosyntactic gender \nversus morphological inflectional class, see Aronoff (1994: 61-87).  \n4\n Booij (2005) discusses some problematic instances from Dutch where a particular \nsyntactic construction appears to select for a particular form. One example involves a \nfamily of constructions which appear to select not simply the plural, but particular plural \nmorphology. Dutch has two plural noun endings, -s and -en, whose distribution is \nphonologically determined (nouns with final stress take -en, otherwise -s). Plural \nnumerals are also found, with the same plural allomorphy, e.g. drie-en \u2018threes\u2019, zeven-s \n\u2018sevens\u2019. Now, there are certain constructions involving numerals which require that the \nnumeral end in -en, e.g. wij drie-en \u2018we three\u2019. This would be problematic for the notion \nof morphology-free syntax were it the case that only numerals with an -en plural could \nparticipate in these constructions, since the only criterion for inclusion would be a \nmorphological one. However, even numerals which normally have an -s plural have an -\nen form available for use in these constructions, e.g. wij zeven-en \u2018we seven\u2019. The -s form \nand -en form are used in mutually exclusive syntactic contexts; that is, they are \nmorphosyntactically distinct, which we might express by the labels \u2018plural 1\u2019 and \u2018plural \n2\u2019. (Or in Booij\u2019s terms, they participate in distinct constructional idioms.) In that case, \nsyntax is kept morphology free: \u2018plural 1\u2019 is realized by the phonologically conditioned \nallomorphs -en and -s, \u2018plural 2\u2019 is realized by -en; all numerals can freely participate in \ncontexts that require either value.  \n 5 \n3 Morphological features \n \nA key and relatively uncontroversial element of linguistic analysis is the use of features, \nthe elements into which linguistic units can be broken down. In almost all theories of \nsyntax there is reference to features such as person, number and gender. And similarly, \ntheories of inflectional morphology regularly call on features. If we are to preserve \nmorphology-free syntax, we must recognize purely morphological features, distinct from \nmorphosyntactic features. While there is a history of work on morphosyntactic features, \nresulting in some limited consensus on their makeup and structure, morphological \nfeatures are poorly studied. They are typically invoked in an ad hoc fashion, with little \nattention to their interrelationships. Building on work on stress patterns in Network \nMorphology and on stems in Paradigm Function Morphology, we take initial steps \ntowards a typology of these morphological features.  \n4 Types of morphological feature \n \nAt this stage of enquiry, our goal is to propose a first typology of morphological features. \nThis can be examined for completeness and for the internal logic. We attempt to be as \ntheory-neutral as possible, but our background assumptions are that inflectional \nmorphology is most adequately analysed in terms of inferential-realizational theories \n(Stump 2001: 1-30). In particular, we find that default inheritance is a powerful tool for \nunderstanding the relation between larger and smaller generalizations on the one hand \nand lexical entries on the other, and so we work within the Network Morphology \nframework (see Corbett & Fraser 1993, Evans, Brown & Corbett 2002, Baerman, Brown \n& Corbett 2005, and references there). Our typology recognizes four types of feature, \nwhich we discuss in turn.  \n4.1 Inflectional class features \nThe example discussed above involves an inflectional class feature. Such features \npartition the vocabulary items according the way in which they realize feature \nspecifications. They may in turn be of different types, and the important point is that they \nmay cross-classify. To illustrate, we consider two different inflectional class features, \nshowing in particular how they interact. \n4.1.1 Inflectional class features: affixal \nLet us consider in more detail a system similar to the one above. Like \nSerbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian, Russian has four main noun paradigms. These cover almost all \nthe inflecting nouns; see Corbett (1982: 202-211) for full justification. Examples can be \nfound in (4): \n \n 6 \n(4) The major noun paradigms of Russian \n \n I II III IV \n NOMINATIVE zakon gazet-a kost\u00b4 vin-o \n ACCUSATIVE zakon gazet-u  kost\u00b4 vin-o \nSG GENITIVE zakon-a gazet-y  kost-i vin-a \n DATIVE zakon-u gazet-e kost-i  vin-u \n INSTRUMENTAL zakon-om  gazet-oj kost\u00b4-ju vin-om \n LOCATIVE zakon-e gazet-e kost-i vin-e \n \n NOMINATIVE zakon-y gazet-y kost-i vin-a \n ACCUSATIVE zakon-y gazet-y kost-i  vin-a \nPL GENITIVE zakon-ov gazet kost-ej vin \n DATIVE zakon-am gazet-am kostj-am vin-am \n INSTRUMENTAL zakon-ami  gazet-ami kostj-ami vin-ami \n LOCATIVE zakon-ax gazet-ax kostj-ax  vin-ax \n \u2018law\u2019 \u2018newspaper\u2019 \u2018bone\u2019  \u2018wine\u2019 \n \nWe give the forms in transliteration of the standard orthography, which is largely \nphonemic. Palatalization of the preceding consonant is indicated by both \u00b4 and j. \n \nThere are very substantial numbers of nouns which decline according to the models \ngiven. There are also some smaller subclasses, which behave almost according to the \nmodel, and can be defined by a specific deviation. For example, there is a subclass of \nclass I where the genitive plural takes the form of the bare stem, for instance, sapog \n\u2018boot\u2019 genitive plural also sapog. There are some twenty nouns which are sufficiently \nirregular to fall outside these main classes (details in Corbett 1982). \n \nThe table shows part of the array of data that an account the inflectional morphology of \nRussian must cover. However, the traditional layout of the table is misleading in one \nrespect. While the full paradigm of each noun requires access to its inflectional class \nfeature, many of the forms of a given noun can be inferred from elsewhere in the system. \nThis is shown clearly in Network Morphology accounts, which take full advantage of \ndefault inheritance (for instance, Corbett & Fraser 1993). Thus for zakon, the fact that the \ndative, instrumental and locative plurals are in turn zakonam, zakonami and zakonax is \nnot of course specific to that inflectional class, it is information shared by inflected nouns \nof Russian.5 In fact, the amount of information that needs to be specified for inflectional \nclass I is just that the nominative singular is the bare stem, and that the genitive plural \nconsists of the stem plus the inflection \u2013ov; all the remaining forms can be inferred from \nelsewhere. In such an analysis the inflectional class feature functions as a hook to link the \nindividual lexical entry into an inheritance network.6 \n \n                                                 \n5\n There are a very few nouns which are exceptional in the instrumental plural. \n6\n Note that defining an inflectional class may need reference in turn to lower level \nmorphological features, e.g. to indicate a pattern of syncretism. \n 7 \n4.1.2 Inflectional class features: prosodic \nPatterns of stress alternation may be seen as parallel paradigms, hierarchically organized, \nwhich have default relations to inflectional paradigms (Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley \n& Timberlake 1996). Such a view requires us to recognize prosodic features as a subtype \nof inflectional class features. These features again take whole lexemes in their scope. \nThey may also refer to lower level morphological features. Since they are much less \nfamiliar than affixal class features, we shall give them somewhat greater attention. \n \nRussian nouns show an interesting set of stress patterns. We follow here the account in \nBrown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley & Timberlake (1996), which also includes reference to \nmany of the earlier sources, notably Zaliznjak (1967). There are four main stress patterns, \nwhich we label A-D. We give three inflectional forms as diagnostics. \n \n(5) Pattern A: stress on the stem throughout: \n \nNOMINATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE  \nPLURAL \ngloss \nzak\u00f3n (I) zak\u00f3nu zak\u00f3nam \u2018law\u2019 \ngaz\u00e9ta (II) gaz\u00e9te gaz\u00e9tam \u2018newspaper\u2019 \ntetr\u00e1d\u00b4 (III) tetr\u00e1di tetr\u00e1djam \u2018exercise book\u2019 \nk\u00e1\u010destvo (IV) k\u00e1\u010destvu k\u00e1\u010destvam \u2018quality\u2019 \n \nFor all of these nouns, the stress is on the stem (different possible syllables) throughout \nthe paradigm. Note that this pattern includes examples from each of the affixal \ninflectional classes. (The affixal inflectional class is indicated in parentheses; if an item is \nnot a fully regular member of the inflectional class, this is indicated with a prime, thus I\u00b4 \nmeans a member of a subclass of inflectional class I.) \n \nStress may also be on the inflection throughout: \n \n(6) Pattern B: stress on the ending throughout: \n \nNOMINATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE  \nPLURAL \ngloss \nkarand\u00e1\u0161 (I)7 karanda\u0161\u00fa karanda\u0161\u00e1m \u2018pencil\u2019 \n\u010dert\u00e1 (II) \u010dert\u00e9 \u010dert\u00e1m \u2018characteristic\u2019 \nve\u0161\u010destv\u00f3 (IV) ve\u0161\u010destv\u00fa ve\u0161\u010destv\u00e1m \u2018substance\u20198 \n \n                                                 \n7\n The genitive plural is karand\u00e1\u0161ej, but this results from a general regularity for certain \nstem-types in the genitive plural so we have not indicated this as an irregularity. \n8\n There are arguably a few nouns like vo\u0161\u00b4 \u2018louse\u2019 belonging to inflectional class III, \nwhich could be counted as having stress pattern B. These nouns have a fleeting vowel, \nand this appears under stress in the instrumental singular (v\u00f3\u0161\u00b4ju) to give a complex \npicture. \n 8 \nThere is a general principle that if stress \u201cshould\u201d fall on the inflection, but there is no \ninflection, then stress will fall on the last syllable of the stem. This is seen in the \nnominative singular form karand\u00e1\u0161 \u2018pencil\u2019.  \n \nThere are two major patterns of mobile stress. In the pattern C, we find initial stress in the \nsingular and ending stress in the plural: \n \n(7) Pattern C: stress on the initial in the singular and on the ending in the plural: \n \nNOMINATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE  \nPLURAL \ngloss \nv\u00e9\u010der (I) v\u00e9\u010deru ve\u010der\u00e1m \u2018evening\u2019 \nz\u00e9rkalo (IV) z\u00e9rkalu zerkal\u00e1m \u2018mirror\u2019 \n \nThe other such pattern shown an alternation between stress on the ending and on the last \nsyllable of the stem: \n \n(8) Pattern D: stress on the ending in the singular and in predesinential position in the \nplural: \n \nNOMINATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE  \nPLURAL \ngloss \nro\u017e\u00f3k (I\u00b4)9 ro\u017ek\u00fa r\u00f3\u017ekam \u2018little (animal) horn\u2019 \ndyr\u00e1 (II) dyr\u00e9 d\u00fdram \u2018hole\u2019 \nkoles\u00f3 (IV) koles\u00fa kol\u00ebsam \u2018wheel\u2019 \n \nNote that \u00eb indicates both a particular vowel quality and the position of the stress. The \nnature of this pattern is quite clear with the bi-syllabic stem koles- \u2018wheel\u2019; the \nmonosyllabic stems can economically be treated as members of this pattern too.  \n \nJust as we find subclasses in affixal inflectional classes, so we find sub-patterns in stress \npatterns. All the sub-patterns involve stress which \u201cshould\u201d be on the inflection, which is \nactually found on the initial syllable. This may affect the nominative plural, the \naccusative singular, or both. Logically we cannot find examples of these sub-patterns in \npattern A.  We do find them in pattern B: here is Bi, having final stress, except for the \nnominative plural (and accusative when identical to the nominative plural): \n \n                                                 \n9\n This noun has a so-called \u2018fleeting vowel\u2019 in the nominative singular, and also in the \ngenitive plural, r\u00f3\u017eek.

It is found \nwith pattern B: \n \n (11) Sub-pattern Bii: as pattern Bi, but the accusative singular has initial stress:  \n \nNOMINATIVE \nSINGULAR \nACCUSATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE \nSINGULAR \nNOMINATIVE \nPLURAL \nDATIVE  \nPLURAL \ngloss \nborod\u00e1 (II) b\u00f3rodu borod\u00e9 b\u00f3rody borod\u00e1m \u2018beard\u2019 \n \nNote that this subpattern has both the exceptional properties. We do not find examples in \nwithin pattern B of the accusative singular sub-regularity without the nominative plural \nbeing involved.  \n \nIn pattern D, we cannot find the sub-regularity involving the nominative plural, since this \nform does not have inflectional stress in this pattern. We do, however, find the accusative \nsub-regularity: \n  \n(12) Sub-pattern Di: as pattern D, but the accusative singular has initial stress: \n \nNOMINATIVE \nSINGULAR \nACCUSATIVE \nSINGULAR \nDATIVE \nSINGULAR \nNOMINATIVE \nPLURAL \nDATIVE  \nPLURAL \ngloss \ncen\u00e1 (II) c\u00e9nu cen\u00e9 c\u00e9ny c\u00e9nam \u2018price\u2019 \n \nThe sub-patterns are more limited in the inflectional classes for which they are found than \nare the main patterns. In terms of nouns involved too, the main patterns cover the \n 10 \noverwhelming majority of nouns (for statistics see Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley & \nTimberlake 1996). The important point is that the same patterns can be found with nouns \nbelonging to different inflectional classes, so that an economical account should treat \nstress separately.10 And just as there is relatively little that needs to be specified for \nindividual inflectional classes (since most material can be inherited from elsewhere), so \nthe stress patterns and sub-patterns can be insightfully treated in terms of default \ninheritance, so that each involves rather little information; see Brown et al. (1996: 66-69) \nfor a Network Morphology account. Finally, though different patterns are found with \ndifferent inflectional classes, there are default linkages between the two, which are also \nhanded in a Network Morphology framework in Brown et al. 1996: 69-79).11   \n4.2 Stem indexing features \nA stem indexing feature picks out stems for particular sections of a paradigm. A key \npoint is that the stem alternations may generalize over different inflectional classes. \nDifferent stems may be phonologically closer or more distant, but we can generalize over \nstems, irrespective of the phonological similarity. For example, Russian verbs have two \nmain stems, which we could call I and II, or infinitive and present. Compare their \nfunction with two rather different verbs: \n \n(13) Stems and some of their functions in two Russian verbs \n \ninfinitive \nstem \ninfinitive past tense \n(masculine \nsingular) \npresent \ntense stem \n1st singular \npresent \ngloss \nplaka- plakat\u00b4 plakal pla\u010d- pla\u010du \u2018cry\u2019 \ntrebova- trebovat\u00b4 treboval trebuj- trebuju \u2018require\u2019 \n \nWe need to be able to refer to the stems because they are used for the same functions \nacross verb types. Thus the infinitive stem, for the majority of verbs, is used to form the \npast tense. Stems may involve consonantal alternations (see \u00a74.5), which in turn \ngeneralize across the system (as is the case with plakat\u00b4 \u2018cry\u2019), or they may not be \nrelatable in this way (as with trebovat\u00b4 \u2018require\u2019). The important point is that there are \nregularities which generalize across stems, irrespective of phonological similarity. For \ndetails of stem indexing in Russian see Brown (1998), and for another detailed case study \nof stem indexing see Stump (2001: 185-199). \n4.3 Syncretic index features \nA syncretic index can be used to refer a form which does not correspond to a \nmorphosyntactic value \u2013 specifically, where the form corresponds to a set of values \n                                                 \n10\n For analysis of the insecting dimensions of stem altenations, including stress, in \nSanskrit, see Stump (2004). \n11\n Note that inflectional classes can be based on prosody, with no distinguishing affixal \nmaterial; an example, according to Finkel & Stump (2006), is the Nilo-Saharan language \nNgiti. Their source is Kutsch Lojenga (1994: 455-511).  \n 11 \n(syncretism). Consider the Livonian paradigms in (14). The first person singular and third \nperson singular are identical for both present and preterite.  \n \n(14) Livonian \u2018read\u2019 (Kettunen 1938: lx-lxii) \n \n present  preterite \n SG  PL  SG PL \n1 lugub  lu\u2019gg\u0259m  lugiz lugizm\u0259 \n2 lugud  lu\u2019gg\u0259t  lugist lugist(\u0259) \n3 lugub  lu\u2019gg\u0259b\u0259d  lugiz lugist(\u0259) \n \nWe want to capture the fact that the combination 1SG\/3SG is treated morphologically as a \nsingle unit on par with 2SG or 1PL. One way of doing this is to associate the combination \nwith a syncretic index: \n \n(15) {1SG, 3SG} = X \n \nThis syncretic index \u2018X\u2019 then participates in inflectional rules in the same way as \nordinary morphosyntactic values. Whenever inflectional rules refer to \u2018X\u2019, both 1SG and \n3SG cells will be affected. This captures the generalization that the same pattern of \nsyncretism is found across distinct parts of the paradigm.12  \n                                                 \n12\n A referee points out another problem raised by syncretism, namely the status of \nmorphosyntactic rules that seem to be sensitive to the availability of a non-syncretic \nform. A well-known example involves genitives in German, where certain constructions \nare only possible where the noun phrase has a distinct genitive form. Thus, an unmodified \nplural noun, whose case paradigm distinguishes between dative and non-dative, cannot \nserve as a genitive complement: \n \n(i) *Benachteiligung  M\u00e4nner \n   discrimination men.PL.NOM\/ACC\/GEN \n   \u2018discrimination against men\u2019 (Plank 1980: 296) \n \nThe addition of a modifier makes the phrase grammatical, as the modifier has a distinct \ngenitive form: \n \n(ii) Benachteiligung  andersgl\u00e4ubig-er M\u00e4nner \n  discrimination heterodox-PL.GEN men.PL.NOM\/ACC\/GEN \n \u2018discrimination against heterodox men\u2019 (Plank 1980: 296) \n \nWe are faced with two possible interpretations. One is to allow the syntactic rule to be \nsensitive to the formal properties of the noun phrase \u2013 in effect, to incorporate a \nmorphological feature into a syntactic rule (Spencer ms). This would be a violation of the \nprinciple of morphology-free syntax. The other interpretation, as suggested in Schachtl \n(1989), would be to claim that the value \u2018genitive\u2019 is absent from bare nouns in German, \nand is rather a property of phrases with an overt modifier. On this interpretation, syntax is \n 12 \n4.4 Morphophonological features \nA morphophonological feature is one which identifies a morphological relationship, such \nas one dependent on umlaut or palatalization, which states that two elements stand in \nsome (morphologically) paradigmatic relationship to each other, without specifying what \nconditions the alternation. While typically phonological in origin, it marks a relationship \nwhich is no longer a matter of productive phonology.  \n \nAn illustration of morphophonological features comes from Polish. Consonants display \ntwo patterns of alternation (16), which we have labelled \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019.  \n \n(16) Consonant alternations in Polish (based on Feldstein 2001: 25) \n \n plain alternation A alternation B \nk, g affricate c [\u0001], dz [\u0001] alveopalatal cz [\u0001], \u015c [\u0001] velars \nch [x] palatal \u015b [\u0001] alveopalatal sz [\u0001] \nr, \u0142 [w]  alveopalatal rz [\u0001], l \np, b, f, w, m palatalized p(i) [py], b(i) [by] f(i) [fy], w(i) [vy], m(i) [my] \nothers \nt, d, s, z, n palatal \u0107 [\u0001], d\u017a [\u0001], \u015b [\u0001], \u017a [\u0001], \u0144 [\u0001] \n \nHistorically, the alternations were the result of phonologically-conditioned palatalization. \nSynchronically, though, the alternations are of various sorts, not necessarily \ncharacterizable as palatalization (e.g. \u0142 [w] ~ l), and the conditioning environments cannot \nbe defined in phonological terms. Both alternations occur in multiple morphological \ncontexts, as shown in (17).  \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \nsensitive to the morphosyntactic profile of forms, and not to morphological \ncharacteristics as such. This would preserve the priciple of morphology-free syntax, at the \ncost of admitting asymmetries in the morphosyntax of noun phrases (for which there is \nsome evidence). This second interpretation involves seeing the genitive in the noun form \nin (i) not as syncretic, but rather as morphosyntactically defective, in effect glossing \nglossing the form as \u2018men.PL.NOM\/ACC\u2019. \n 13 \n(17) Alternation contexts (Feldstein 2001: 26-31) \nAlternation A:  i. dative\/locative singular of a-stem (or class II)  nouns \n Praga (NOM) ~ Pradze (LOC) \u2018Prague\u2019 \n  ii. virile (male human) plural of nouns and modifiers \n Norweg (SG) ~ Norwedzy (PL) \u2018Norwegian\u201913 \n \nAlternation B: i. vocative singular in -e (nouns) \n B\u00f3g (NOM) ~ Bo\u015ce (VOC) \u2018God\u2019 \n ii.

We cannot claim to have solved \nthis issue. However, we can observe some typical patterns which recur cross-\nlinguistically, as we answer four relevant questions, contrasting morphosyntactic and \nmorphological features. We noted in the introduction that the need for morphological \nfeatures is an indication of non-canonical inflectional systems.15  \n                                                 \n13\n In this context, alveopalatal sz [\u0001] and \u015c [\u0001] alternate with palatal \u015b [\u0001] and  \u017a [\u0001], e.g. \nnasz (SG) ~ nasi (PL) \u2018our\u2019 (Feldstein 2001: 28).  \n14\n See Matthews (1972: 162); Matthews uses \u2018morphosyntactic category\u2019 while we prefer \n\u2018morphosyntactic feature\u2019. \n15\n The canonical approach has been suggested as a way to make progress in some of the \nareas of language which prove difficult for typology (Corbett 2005, forthcoming a). The \nbasic technique is to define carefully a theoretical space, and only then to situate the \nlanguage phenomena within it. Converging definitions give us a canonical point, where \nwe find the best, clearest, most indisputable examples (however rare such examples may \nbe). In terms of inflection, a canonical system is one in which lexical material remains \nconstant through a lexeme\u2019s paradigm, but the inflectional material is different; and when \ncomparing cell by cell across lexemes, the lexical material is different but the inflectional \nmaterial is the same (Corbett forthcoming b). According to this notion, having \nmorphosyntactic features determining inflection is canonical, while any morphological \nfeature is non-canonical. \n \n 14 \n5.1 Are they \u201cdirect\u201d? \nZwicky (1992) draws a distinction between direct and indirect features. For him, direct \nfeatures like number and tense have intrinsic content, they are directly associated with \ndefault semantics. Features like case and declension, he suggests, are not. Of course, it is \nnot suggested that morphosyntactic features correspond exactly to semantics, only that \nthey are \u2018associated directly with prototypical, or default, semantics\u2019. Equally, there may \nbe some link even for indirect features; for example, nouns denoting male humans in \nRussian usually belong to inflectional class I. However, this is different in kind and \ndegree to the link found with direct features. This distinction does not provide a clear \ndiagnostic for morphological features. It would appear that direct features are \nmorphosyntactic, while indirect features may be morphosyntactic (as with case) or \nmorphological (as with inflectional class). \n5.2 Is there a fixed list of features? \nThis is an issue that has been little discussed, though often linguists imply a fixed list of \nmorphosyntactic features (see Zwicky 1986: 988-989 for early discussion). It may be that \nwe have not yet discovered them all, but it is reasonable, in our view, to assume that there \nis a set from which languages may draw. For morphological features, specified at the \nlevel of abstraction given above, we suggest that there is also a fixed list of possibilities. \n5.3 Is there a fixed list of values? \nFor morphosyntactic features we suggest there is also a fixed list of possible values. For \nsome features we are well on the way towards establishing that list. Thus the largest \nnumber systems have five values; however, not all systems with a particular number of \nvalues have exactly the same values, and there is more to be done to establish the list. On \nthe other hand, the feature case can have a large number of values, and a plausible list is \nsome way off. \n \nFor morphological feature values the picture is quite different. If we consider again the \nnominal system of Russian we see that there are certainly at least four values for the \ninflectional class feature (I-IV above). But as mentioned there are various smaller \ngroupings that can be treated as subclasses. As we look at smaller and smaller subclasses \n(going lower and lower down an inheritance hierarchy) we reach the point where we are \nmaking specific points about individual lexical entries. For instance, though all inflecting \nRussian nouns have the instrumental in \u2013ami, there is a handful of nouns, like do\u010d\u00b4 \n\u2018daughter\u2019, instrumental do\u010der\u00b4mi, which are exceptional. Whether this is treated as fact \njust about that lexical entry or as a property of a subclass seems not to be an issue of \nsubstance. Hence there is no point at which we could say that we have reached the limit \nof values of morphological features. And more generally, values like \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018weak\u2019 \nhave no cross-linguistic consistency. What counts as a strong verb in German is not the \nsame as a strong verb in Tsakhur. We cannot give a fixed list with confidence for a \nparticular language, and the less so for languages in general. Hence the criterion of \nhaving a fixed list of values does distinguish morphosyntactic from morphological \nfeatures.  \n 15 \n5.4 Is there structuring within the feature? \nThere is evidence for structuring of morphosyntactic features, though perhaps not \nsufficient to assume that all features automatically have branching structure (Baerman, \nBrown & Corbett 2005: 126-131). There is solid evidence from default use, facultative \nuse and superclassing (Corbett 2006: 125). Within morphological features too there is \nevidence for subclasses within the main classes, as we saw in \u00a74.1. \n \n5.5 Summary of distinctions \nWe can now review the distinctions discussed in this section.  \n \n(18) Summary of the distinctions drawn in \u00a75 \n \n morphosyntactic features  morphological features \nAre they \u201cdirect\u201d? (\u00a75.1) yes\/no no \nFixed list of features? (\u00a75.2) yes yes \nFixed list of values? (\u00a75.3) yes no \nStructuring within feature? \n(\u00a75.4) \nyes yes \n \nThe first and third criteria are those which appear of most obvious analytical value. \nHowever, (18) also offers a second line of attack on the problem of distinguishing \nmorphosyntactic from morphological features. At first sight, the second criterion \u2013 fixed \nlist of values \u2013 seems unhelpful, since this criterion holds for both types. And yet, if as \nwe suggest there is fixed cross-linguistic list of the features of both types, this is useful \nstep forward, for distinguishing between the features and so maintaining content for the \nprinciple of morphology-free syntax. Of course, such a list can be updated by the \ndiscovery of a new language with a new feature. But such a feature would require careful \njustification. The assumption must be that we know what the features are, and an analysis \nrequiring some new feature should immediately attract scrutiny.  \n6 The need for morphological features \nThe concluding issue is whether we really need morphological features. An objection \nsometimes raised is that morphological features are somehow too abstract, and attempts \nare made to derive the same effects by reference to lexical listing. We would argue that \nthis is a variant formalization of the same set of generalizations. The presence of a \nmorphological feature in a lexical entry has two functions: (i) it expresses the fact that the \ninflection of the lexeme requires some specific piece of information, and (ii) it indexes \nthe location of that specific inflectional information (for instance, in an inheritance \nhierarchy). Alternatively, one could list all the inflected forms in the lexical entry itself. \nBut the links between lexical entries, e.g. which ones share the same pattern, must still be \ndescribed somewhere in the grammar. Each network of shared morphological patterns \ncorresponds to a morphological feature. The difference between the two approaches is \nsimply in how the morphological patterns are indexed: through a morphological feature, \nor through an enriched lexical entry.  \n \n 16 \nThe general case for morphological features is made by the arguments justifying \u2018purely \nmorphological\u2019 phenomena (Aronoff 1994). And work on heteroclites (Stump 2006) \ndemonstrates the need for such features particularly clearly. But there is a more specific \nquestion for those of us whose morphological model uses hierarchically arranged \ndefaults: is there even here a need for morphological features? These features may be \nthought of as the name of a node in the hierarchy which defines a class of morphological \nobjects (those which inherit from it). The other side of the coin is that they are the hook \nin individual lexical entries, which specify the node in an inheritance hierarchy at which \nthe lexical item attaches. From both points of view, these nodes indicate a clustering of \nproperties. When we describe a system like the Russian inflectional system given in (4), \nwe find that there is more than one fact that we need to specify for each class. The \ninformation is found grouped in this way, rather than being spread evenly across the \nnetwork (see Corbett and Fraser 1993 for a formal account showing this). Moreover, the \nlexical items also cluster: the major classes given in (4) each include several thousand \nnouns, and the minor classes have relatively few members in comparison. It is this \nclustering, of the properties which define the morphological features and of the lexical \nitems carrying them, which gives morphological features their cross-linguistic interest. \n \nReferences \nAronoff, Mark 1994.
