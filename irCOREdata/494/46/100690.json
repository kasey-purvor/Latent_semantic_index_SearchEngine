[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1772518]\nThin-film field-effect transistors (FETs) made using hy-\ndrogenated amorphous silicon sa-Si:Hd as the semiconduc-\ntor are notoriously unstable. This instability, characterized by\na large shift in threshold voltage and a reduction in drain\ncurrent during operation,1 severely limits their use in both\nanalog and digital circuits for displays and large area elec-\ntronics, in general. As such, the most important application is\nas a simple pixel switch in actively addressed liquid-crystal\ndisplay arrays with anything more demanding such as pe-\nripheral or pixel circuitry being difficult or impossible.\nSilicon dangling bond defects are formed over a wide\nrange of energies within the band gap of amorphous silicon\nin regions where the electron quasi-Fermi level moves from\nits equilibrium position determined during the growth of the\na-Si:H.1,2 This position, close to the center of the band in\nundoped material, determines the energy distribution and\nnumber of the different bonding configurations between sili-\ncon and hydrogen when in chemical equilibrium. For a FET,\nthe electron quasi-Fermi level in the channel region moves\ntoward the conduction band as the transistor is biased into\naccumulation.3,4 This is accompanied by an increase in the\nelectron concentration. The microscopic mechanisms for the\ncreation of dangling bond defect states are complex3 as the\nmaterial strives to achieve an equilibrium between the weak\nsilicon\u2013silicon bonds, the dangling bond defects and the\nelectron concentration.4 Defect states trap electrons and there\nis a shift in the threshold voltage of the FET.\nSince the defect generation mechanism is fundamental,\nthere is very little that can be done about it in FETs as they\nrely on electron accumulation in a channel region for their\noperation. At a given gate voltage, drift and instability are\nindependent of current and are particularly severe when op-\nerating well above threshold.\nSource-gated transistors (SGTs)5 form a class of thin-\nfilm transistors in which the current is controlled entirely by\nthe source.6 Their most important advantage compared with\na FET is the much smaller saturation voltage VSAT. An ex-\nample of the characteristics of a SGT made using a Schottky\nbarrier source is shown in Fig. 1 together with a schematic\nshowing its structure. VSAT at VG=20 is ,2.5 V. This com-\npares with 17 V sVG\u2212VTd for a FET made with the same\nlayers. The SGT also has a large output impedance.5,6 The\nmain difference with a FET is the provision of a source bar-\nrier rather than an ohmic contact and a gate located below it\nthat controls the current flowing across the reverse biased\nbarrier. Current saturation occurs when the source barrier\ndepletes the underlying a-Si:H. Ion implantation is used to\ncontrol the source barrier height and compensate for the re-\ngion between the source and drain contacts.6,7 This region\n[(d) in Fig. 1] forms a parasitic FET in series with the gate-\ncontrolled source which determines the off current, while the\ngated source barrier controls the on current. A full descrip-\ntion of how the SGT works and how it was made can be\nfound in Refs. 5 and 6.\nFETs and SGTs were made using the same depositions\nof insulator and a-Si:H. The insulator was SiN grown at\n250 \u00b0C to a thickness of 300 nm while the a-Si:H also\ngrown at 250 \u00b0C had a thickness of 100 nm. The hydrogen\ncontent was ,10%. The transfer characteristics of an SGT\nand FET following stress at 30 \u00b0C, 20 V gate voltage for\nvarious times are shown in Fig. 2. The FET shows the clas-\nsical threshold voltage shift, which affects the current up to\nthe maximum gate voltage of 20 V.

The reason for the excellent stability of the\nSGT lies in the fact that the electron quasi-Fermi level in the\ndepleted source at the nitride\u2013semiconductor interface is\nclose to midgap and similar to where it was when the\na-Si:H was grown. Therefore, the distribution of states in\nchemical equilibrium is very similar and few states are gen-\nerated. In contrast, the electron quasi-Fermi level in the FET\nmoves toward the band edge (Fig. 3) and states are generated\nas the distribution of states in the a-Si:H moves toward a\nchemical equilibrium.\nThe decrease in current as a percentage of the initial\ncurrent during current stressing is shown in Fig. 4(a) for a\nFET and a high and low current SGT. It is seen that the SGT\nis much more stable. Extrapolating the decay curves shows\nthat the current through the FET under these accelerated\nstress conditions decays by 50% in <1 h. The corresponding\nvalues for the SGTs are .105 h and 108 h for the high and\nlow current devices, respectively. The difference between the\ntwo SGTs arises because they operate at different current\ndensities. SGT2 had a current density per unit width nearly\nten times larger than SGT1 and within a factor of 2 smaller\nthan the FET. Computer calculations (SILVACO) show that the\nelectron concentration in the FET is a factor .104, and .103\nhigher than in the source of the low and high current SGTs,\nrespectively. Our assumption that the quasi-Fermi level is in\nthe center of the band is, therefore, less valid as the current\nincreases but the high current device is still much more\nstable than the FET.\nOur understanding of the improved stability of the SGT\ncompared to the FET suggests that the stability will be\nstrongly dependent on drain bias. The source will not be\ndepleted for small drain bias and the stability will be \u201cFET\nlike,\u201d while for VD.VSAT the stability will be \u201cSGT like.\u201d\nThis feature is illustrated in Fig. 4(b) where accelerated\nstress tests are performed on a similar device to SGT1 but\nwith different drain voltages. It is clearly seen that an unde-\npleted source sVD=0d drifts rapidly while applying a drain\nvoltage above the saturation voltage s2 Vd provides us with a\nvery stable mode of operation. The improvement between\n5 V and 10 V occurs because the parasitic FET also becomes\ndepleted at higher drain voltages. The change in current at\nthe end of the accelerated stress tests was ,2.5%, which\nsuggests that under normal operating conditions the instabil-\nity would be negligible over many thousands of hours.\nTherefore, we should be able to achieve stable operation at\nlow currents using gate voltages well above the threshold\nregion where threshold variations are the most deleterious. It\nshould be noted that a SGT made using a Schottky barrier\nsource has a characteristic that is more sensitive to tempera-\nture than a FET, especially at low currents, and proper circuit\ndesign is required to correct for this.\nIn summary, it has been shown that the stability of a\nSGT in a-Si:H under temperature\u2013voltage stress is very\nmuch better than a standard FET. This arises from the fact\nthat the current through a SGT is controlled by a fully de-\nFIG. 2.
