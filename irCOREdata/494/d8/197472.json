While carnival lasts, there is no other life outside it. During \ncarnival time life is subject only to its laws, that is, the laws of its own freedom\u2026. \nCarnival celebrated temporary liberation from the prevailing truth and from the \nestablished order\u2026 it demanded ever changing, playful, undefined forms. \n(Bakhtin \u2014 cited in Green, 2001, p.159) \n \n \nIntroduction - What does it mean to \"flirt\"? 1 \n \nThis is an article that addresses the little researched area of cyber-flirting, \nwhich we contend is both similar and different to what we might otherwise dub \nnormal ('offline') flirting. Before comparing and distinguishing these two types of \nbehaviour that we call flirting, it is instructive to lay a foundation through describing \nwhat traditionally we would take as (offline) flirting behaviour. \nTheorists have defined flirting in a number of different ways. For example, \nDowney and Vitulli (1987) have argued that flirtation can be defined in two ways: \nOne implies an existing casual relationship where one or both persons are \nengaged in maintaining some suggestion or expectation of intimacy without \nintentions of increasing its level or allowing some type of \"consummation\" ... \nbut another common meaning seems to refer simply to the initial actions one \ntakes to convey a message of interest or attraction. (p. 899) \nIn contrast to this definition, Feinberg (1996) contended that flirting involves \nteasing and communication. She proposed that flirting is a short cut to intimacy, \narguing that: \"Flirting transmits a hidden message the same as other types of teasing. \nThe underlying communication is to find out how intimate a person wants to become \nor if she wants to become intimate at all\" (p. 40). \nWhile the aim of flirtation for some might be solely to indicate sexual \nattraction to another, this is not its only motivation. Rather, it has been suggested that \nthere are three main reasons for why people flirt: (1) to signal sexual interest; (2) to \ntest the grounds to see if others still find them attractive; and\/or (3) to simply pass the \ntime of day (Feinberg, 1996). \n 4 \n \nSimmel (1984) has written extensively on flirting, and proposes that: \nthe distinctiveness of the flirt lies in the fact that she awakens delight and \ndesire by means of unique antithesis and synthesis: through the alternation or \nsimultaneity of accommodation and denial; by a symbolic, allusive assent and \ndissent, acting \u201cas if from a remote distance\u201d; or a platonically expressed, \nthough placing having and not-having in a state of polar tension even as she \nseems to make them felt concurrently (p. 134).  \nSimilarly, Ben-Ze\u2019ve (2002) has defined flirting as: \nnot necessarily a prelude to sexual interaction; it is rather a subtle, sexual \ncommunication. Flirting may involve gentle physical contact, but typically it \ndoes not involve sexual penetration\u201d.  \nBen-Ze\u2019ve also quite rightly, in our view, points out that although flirting can \neventuate into sexual relationships, if it does it ceases to be flirting. \nIn 1978 Givens developed a five-stage model on courting which highlights \nsome of the important non-verbal and paralinguistic cues involved in flirting \nbehaviour (the first three stages relate to flirting). The first stage in this model is the \nattention phase, where individuals typically use primping, object caressing, and \ncasting quick glances at and then away from each other. In the second phase, the \nrecognition phase, flirting behaviour consists of head cocking, pouting, primping, \neyebrow flashing and smiling. Givens suggested that interaction does not occur until \nthe third stage, where conversation is initiated. During this stage, participants appear \nhighly animated, displaying laughing or giggling. To quote Givens (1978): \nSpeaking, or more broadly, linguistic-like contact \u2013 which would include \nAmerican Sign Language, writing, using mutually unintelligible languages, \nand so on -- appears to be essential if courtship is to proceed. However, the \nspeech topic itself seems to be quite irrelevant to the formation of the bond. \nThe final two stages in his model are sexual arousal and resolution. \nHighlighted in Givens' work is the notion that flirting behaviour consists \nmainly of non-verbal signals. Researchers such as Feinberg, (1996), Koeppel, \nMontagne-Miller, O\u2019Hair, and Cody (1993) and Moore (1985) have also identified a \nrepertoire of facial expressions and gestures. What becomes obvious from reading \nthese researchers\u2019 work, is the critical role the body plays in flirtation. They \ncollectively argue that using the body in isolation of verbal cues allows one to convey \nsexual interest without the high risk of possible humiliation, shame or possible \n 5 \n \nrejection, and contend that the body can signal attraction in more subtle ways than the \nspoken word. \nThe research literature on flirting behaviour has identified some basic 'codes', \nor behaviours, that are often displayed\/enacted in combination (see, for example \nMoore, 1985). These basic codes include: kinetics, such as smiling, tossing the hair, \nexposing one\u2019s neck; oculesics (e.g., demure glances, short darting glances); physical \nappearance (taking that special care to look one\u2019s best); olfactics (e.g., wearing \nperfume, after-shave); vocalics (e.g., animated speech); proxemics (e.g., leaning \ntowards the other); and, haptics (e.g., primping, object caress). These basic codes \nwould, no doubt, resonate with our general day-to-day observations of ourselves and \nothers. Having given a general overview of what might be familiar to us all as \nconstituting flirting behaviour, how is cyber-flirting different and yet the same? It is to \nthis question that we now turn our attention. \n \n \nDefining cyber-flirting \nHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard \nAre sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;\u2026 \nBold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, \nThough winning near the goal yet, do not grieve; \nShe cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, \nFor ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! \nKeats (Ode on a Grecian Urn) \n \nCyber-flirting may share similar motivations to offline flirtation, however the \nmeans by which people flirt and the trajectories of these relationships can in some \nways be quite different. Ben-Ze\u2019ev (2002), for example, has distinguished between an \nonline relationship that is intended to find an actual romantic or sexual partner and \none that is intended to be an exclusive online romantic or sexual relationship. He \nargues that online-only romantic relationships are a new type of social relationship. \nOne of the unique aspects of these relationships is the greater value placed on \nconversations. Levine (2000) supports this notion, stressing the importance that some \nindividuals place on spelling and grammar in their online interactions. This \nfundamentally challenges Givens\u2019 (1978) work on traditional flirting, suggesting that \n 6 \n \nwe need to think about flirting in new ways. Moreover, it should be noted that \nGivens\u2019 (1978) and Moore\u2019s (1985) work is based on western middle-class \nassumptions. \nWhile we agree that online flirtation is a unique interaction and needs to be \nconsidered separately from offline flirtation, we nonetheless wish to point out that the \nbody still plays an important role in these interactions. Obviously, the non-verbal cues \npresented earlier to define offline flirting are typically not physically present, as there \nis not a physically present body to convey these signals. However, this does not mean \nthat these cues do not exist. Rather, the body needs to be thought of as being \nrepresented through the textual exchanges that occur online. While spelling and \ngrammar may indeed be important for some, it is proposed here that the well-\nstructured sentence itself is not the \u2018turn on\u2019, but rather the meaning conveyed within \nthe sentence. For example, one\u2019s physical appearance can be described, whereas \noculesics can be represented through emoticons (drawings made from grammatical \nsymbols, such as, :) representing a smile). \nIn the past, it is our argument that writers have tended to over-state the \nabsence of the body online. For example, in respect to Internet romantic relationships \none writer has commented that \u201csome Internet lovers come to the conclusion that they \nlove each other before they even meet or without ever meeting\u2026\u201d (Gwinnell, 1998, p. \n89). The implication here is that bodies can only meet offline. To give a further \nexample, McRae (1996) has defined cybersex or virtual sex as \u201ca generic term for \nerotic interaction between individuals whose bodies may never touch\u2026\u201d (p. 243). \nAgain this writer is focusing on the lack of bodies online. \nWhile this view of cyberspace as being a place where there is no body might \nbe considered conceptually useful, it is still a very narrow construction of how we \nshould conceive of cyberspace and the activity that occurs there. In a somewhat \ncontrasting view, we suggest that the reconstruction of the body is imperative to the \nsuccess of many interpersonal interactions over the Internet. In many cases online \ninterpersonal interactions involve more than a meeting of minds, especially in respect \nto flirting on the Internet. Whitty and Gavin (2001; see also Whitty, 2002a) have \ncarried out empirical research with Internet users and the following quote from an \ninterview conducted with a 22 year old man illustrates the  point that online \ninteractions are more than merely a meeting of the minds: \n 7 \n \n\"They all think I'm a six foot tall tanned lifesaver. I tell them certain things that are \ntrue, but other things are bullshit. I mean, I can get away with it so why not. What \nthey don't know won't hurt them. I will admit that I am pretty sly when it comes to \nsmooth talking certain ladies on the net ...\". (Whitty & Gavin, 2001, p. 629) \nClearly, this individual appears to believe that success in flirting with women \ndepends on how he describes his physical body \u2013 whether this is his real body or a re-\nconstructed body. \nOnline people do describe what their bodies look like and feel like. This is \nexemplified in the following extract in an email sent from an individual to their \nInternet lover:  \n\"Very quietly, because the night is so very quiet a hundred miles from all other \nhumans, of the lake. We lean up against each other for warmth, I have my arm \naround you to hold you close. The sense of waiting becomes almost intolerable\u2026. \nWe reach out to touch the reflections and out hands meet in the sparkling water. \nBreathless from the transformation of night to day, I turn to you and our lips \nmeet\u2026\". (Gwinnell, 1998, p. 59) \nMoreover, when bodies are not constructed within the text, individuals will \noften construct their own image of the person with whom they are conversing. This is \nillustrated in the following extract of an email:  \n\"I have been waiting to ask you this for a while now \u2013 would you mind telling me \nwhat you look like? It is hard to just write to a faceless someone, and I have to say \nI have made up a picture in my mind of what you look like\". (Gwinnell, 1988, p. \n66) \nThis extract highlights that even when a physical body is not presented, a physical \nimage can fill in this gap. Hence, we cannot subscribe to Ben-Ze\u2019ev\u2019s (2002) view \nthat: \nPhysical appearance has hardly any role in the generation of such love; the ongoing \nsomeone is something we should learn and invest effort in, then online \ncommunication seems to be a good way to do it, as physical features do not blur \nthe profound characteristics of the person with whom we would like to have a \nloving relationship. \nIn light of empirical evidence described above, this is perhaps a little too utopian and \nidealistic understanding of the nature of Internet relationships. \n \n 8 \n \nCyber-flirting can also be said to have much in common with what we might \ndescribe as 'courtly love', where: \nthe male lover presents himself as engrossed in a yearning desire for the love of an \nexceedingly beautiful and perfect woman whose strange emotional aloofness and \nhigh social status make her appear hopelessly distant. But the frustrated and \nsorrowful lover cannot overcome his fascination and renders faithful \u201clove service\u201d \nto this \u201chigh-minded\u201d and exacting lady who reciprocates in a surprising manner: \nShe does not grant him the amorous \u201creward\u201d which he craves, but she gives him \nwhat immeasurably increases his \u201cworth\u201d: She rewards him with approval and \nreassurance. (Moller, 1959, p. 137) \nCourtly love is said to have its origins in the twelfth century and was a luxury \nof the aristocrats (Askew, 1965). Andreas Capellanus in his book The Art of Courtly \nLove attempted to systematically record the rules of Courtly Love (Capellanus, \n1941\/1960). He described these relationships as idealised relationships that could not \nexist within the context of a \u201creal life\u201d marriage. Courtly lovers apparently spent a \ngreat deal of time talking to each other, mostly about love, the nature of love and the \nprogress of love. The courtly lovers could not physically act out their passions, and if \nmade public this love rarely endured. Finding it to be extremely oppressive to women, \nit may be of little surprise that feminist theorists are completely 'opposed' to courtly \nlove (Hoffman Baruch, 1991). While we would not like to have courtly love \nreplicated online, there are some similar aspects between courtly love and cyber-\nflirting that ought to be highlighted. For instance, cyber-flirting is unlike a real life \nmarriage while it remains solely online. Conversations can abound about love online, \nbut in a real physical sense cannot be consummated. Online relationships can also \nseem hopelessly distant, as with courtly love.  \nTurkle (1996) has also suggested that romantic relationships developed in \nonline settings can be a means to understanding a deeper truth about oneself. This is \nreflected in her description of an online relationship developed by two individuals in a \nmulti-user dimension or domains (MUDs) environment: \nThey are able to have conversations about love quite different from those that \nwould be possible if they followed the courtly conventions that constrain \ncommunications between men and women. In this way, the play suggests that \ndonning a mask, adopting a persona, is a step toward reaching a deeper truth about \n 9 \n \nthe real, a position many MUDders take regarding their experiences as virtual \nselves. (p. 216) \nPsychodynamically, it is this interesting parallel with play that we find, \ncompelling in trying to better come to terms with the nature of cyber-flirting. It is to \nthe psychodynamics related to play to which we now turn our attention. \n \n \nCyber-flirting: Transformational play \n \nPlay is immensely exciting. It is exciting not primarily because the instincts are \ninvolved, be it understood! The thing about playing is always the precariousness of \nthe interplay of personal psychic reality and the experience of control of actual \nobjects. This is the precariousness of magic itself, magic that arises in intimacy, in \na relationship that is being found to be reliable. (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p.47) \n \nIn considering cyber-flirting as a form of play2, we would like to draw from a \npsychoanalytic perspective \u2014 in particular, that of Winnicott\u2019s object-relations \ntheory. A psychodynamic3 view of play emphasises the importance of the ephemeral \nquality of illusion in play (Modell, 1990). Carr (in press) argues that:  \nThose who champion a psychoanalytic approach to the understanding of play, \ninsist that play is all about illusion and that such illusion can only be sustained \nprovided play can be kept within a frame of its own \u2014 a frame which seeks to \nseparate it from ordinary life. \n \nModell (1990) has also stressed the importance of considering play as separate \nfrom ordinary life. Play can be separated from ordinary life, in a number of ways: \nPlaying takes place in a certain space and has certain limitations regarding the \nduration of time, as in games that are \u201cplayed out\u201d within a certain limit of time. \nYet playing may have its own quality of timelessness. Playing is also separated \nfrom ordinary life by the \u201crules of the game\u201d: all play has its rules that pertain to \nthe temporary world in which playing takes places. Rules are in effect a means of \ncontaining a space in which illusions can flourish. (p. 27) \n \n 10 \n \nWinnicott focused on the importance of play, especially during childhood, and \ncharacterised play as follows: \n(1) Play is essentially creative. (2) Playing is always exciting because it deals with \nthe existence of a precarious borderline between the subject and that which can be \nobjectively perceived. (3) Playing takes place in the potential space between the \nbaby and the mother-figure\u2026(4) Playing develops in this potential space according \nto the opportunity that the baby has to experience separation without separation. \n(Winnicott 1964\/1991 p.146) \nAlthough Winnicott did write in detail about the importance of play during \nchildhood, he also believed that play is as an important activity during adulthood \n(1971\/1997). He stated that: \"Whatever I say about children playing really applies to \nadults as well...\" (p. 40). In line with Freud\u2019s view on play (see for example Freud, \n1908\/1985, p. 132), Winnicott argued that \u201cplay transcended the serious and non-\nserious oppositional binary\u201d (Carr, 2001, p. 544). \nWinnicott was very interested in what he called the potential space \u2014 a space \nbetween the mother and the infant. He contrasted this \"potential space (a) with the \ninner world (which is related to the psychosomatic partnership) and (b) with actual, or \nexternal reality\" (1971\/1997, p.41). Winnicott understood \u2018potential spaces\u2019 to be an \narea of intermediate experiencing that is between inner and outer worlds, \u201cbetween \nthe subjective object and the object objectively perceived\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. \n100). Winnicott (1971\/1997) argued that the potential space is: \nthe hypothetical area that exists (but cannot exist) between the baby and the object \n(mother of part of mother) during the phase of the repudiation of the object as not-\nme, that is, at the end of being merged in with the object. (p. 107) \nWinnicott noticed, for example, how an infant would suck and hug a doll or \nblanket. He suggested that the doll or blanket didn\u2019t represent a doll or blanket as \nsuch, but is rather an as-if object. The infant makes use of the illusion that although \nthis is not the breast, treating it as such will allow an appreciation of what is \u201cme\u201d and \nwhat is \u201cnot-me\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 41). Although referred to as a transitional \nobject, \u201cit is not the object, of course that is transitional\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. \n14). The object is the initial manifestation of a different positioning of the infant in the \nworld: the doll or blanket thus connects to subjective experience, but is in the \nobjective world. \n \n 11 \n \nWhile the notions of transitional objects and potential space are raised within a \ncontext of an infant, Winnicott (1971\/1997) insists, however, they are not simply \nconfined to the experience of infants\u2019, but are something that \u201cthroughout life is \nretained in the intense experiencing that belongs to the arts and to religion and to \nimaginative living, and to creative scientific work\u201d (p. 24). We come to rely upon our \nown resources to experience culture to expand our understanding of the world. In his \nexpanded views on mental health and creativity, Winnicott argues that a person who \nlives in a realm of subjective omnipotence, with no bridge to objective reality, is self-\nabsorbed and autistic. A person who lived only in the realm of objective reality, with \nno roots in subjective omnipotence, was viewed by Winnicott as superficially \nadjusted, but lacking passion and originality. As Mitchell and Black (1995) nicely \nsummarise, it was \u201cprecisely the ambiguity of the transitional realm that rooted \nexperience in deep and spontaneous sources within the self and, at the same time, \nconnected self-expression with a world of other subjectivities\u201d (p. 128). This realm \nprovides relief \u201cfrom the strain of relating inner and outer reality \u2026 that no human is \nfree from\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 24). The tension and strain between inner and \nouter worlds is not eliminated, but is bound in this space. Culture and cultural activity, \nin this context, is an expression of the \u201cinter-play between separateness and union\u201d \n(Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 24). \nThe potential space is not pure fantasy, nor is it  pure reality. \u201cIn the absence \nof potential space, there is only fantasy; within potential space imagination can \ndevelop\u201d (Ogden, 1985, p. 133). Winnicott believed that given a \u2018good enough\u2019 \nenvironment, the interplay of the inner world and external reality promotes the \ndevelopment of self and facilitates growth. It is a space where we can develop \npsychologically, to integrate love and hate and to create, destroy and re-create \nourselves (see Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 41). \nIn line with Winnicott's object-relations theory and, specifically, his \nconception of potential space and how transitional objects allow us to position \nourselves in the world, Turkle (1996) suggests that \u201cthe computer can be similarly \nexperienced as an object on the border between self and not-self \u2026 People are able to \nsee themselves in the computer. The machine can seem a second self \u2026\u201d (p. 30). \nStone (1995) takes a similar view, arguing that:  \nI am interested in prosthetic communication for what it shows of the \u201creal\u201d world \nthat might otherwise go unnoticed. And I am interested because of the potential of \n 12 \n \ncyberspace for emergent behavior, for new social forms that arise in a \ncircumstance in which body, meet, place, and even space mean something quite \ndifferent from our accustomed understanding\u2026 . I want to see how groups of \nfriends evolve when their meeting room exists in a purely symbolic space. (p. 37). \nFurther, Faber (1984) adds that machines and keyboard are part of a \ntechnology that have transitional implications and potential. In Faber's words: \nTechnology\u2019s transitional implications are revealed most arrestingly through \nanalysis of the machine that resides at the centre of the current industrial and \npolitical order, namely the computer: it offers itself to its manipulator as a \npowerful little world, a powerful little universe, a kind of microcosm, that can be \ntotally mastered, totally controlled, in such a way as to offset, at the unconscious \nlevel, early narcissistic would experienced in the failure to master, to control, the \nprimary caregiver or \u2018object\u2019. (p. 267) \nWe would like to extend on these theorists\u2019 work to explore the possibilities of \ncyberspace as potential space (see also Whitty, 2003). Some theorists have suggested \nthat cyberspace is a place where people are liberated to be whoever they want to be \n(e.g., Turkle, 1996). Cyberspace, like Winnicott\u2019s potential space, is perhaps a space \nsomewhere outside the individual, but is still not the external world. The participants \nand their transitional objects: the computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, software, \nmodems, text, cables, telephone lines, and so forth; all occupy this potential space \u2014 \na space between the 'real individuals' and the 'fantasy individuals'. \nThus one might contend that flirting is a type of play that can occur in this \npotential space \u2014 cyberspace. Cyber-flirting, although akin in some ways with offline \nflirting, is characterised here as a unique activity that is a form of play. Of course it \ncan be argued, with justification, that offline flirting is also a form of play. That said, \ncyberspace seems to offer more opportunities for the type of play Winnicott describes \nto occur. Similarly, cyberspace offers opportunities for this play to be \ntransformational. \nWe express this view given that offline flirting requires that another be \nphysically present; this creates a space where rejection is more possible and probably \nmore damaging to one\u2019s self concept. The Internet, in contrast, gives to many the \nappearance of a safer environment; a safer space to play and experiment at flirting. \n\u201cThe friendly and safer atmosphere surrounding the formation of online relationships \nincrease the likelihood that people will choose to begin their relationship in this way\u201d \n 13 \n \n(Ben-Ze\u2019ve, 2002). Moreover, rejection is less likely to cause distress when you can \ndisconnect at any time, and the chances are remarkably decreased as to the likelihood \nof ever having a chance meeting with your cyber-playmate. \nIn contrast to offline flirtation, cyber-flirting requires more imagination and \nfantasy. As Ben-Ze\u2019ev (2002) maintains: \u201cThe role of imagination in generating \nemotions in cyberspace is even greater than in actual-space. The factual information \nwe have about an online partner is more limited than our knowledge of an actual \npartner, and our imagination must fill in the gap\u201d. While offline flirtation could be \nalso seen as type of play (e.g., the married man or woman who flirts at a party in order \nto be reassured they are still attractive, but with no intention of taking things further), \nwe would contend that cyberspace creates more opportunities for the type of play that \nWinnicott describes. This type of play requires that one sustains an illusion, and we \npropose that this is easier to maintain in an online environment. \nSome writers have suggested that honesty is a critical factor in the success of \ncyber-flirting. Rabin (1999) makes this claim, stating that nearly everyone she speaks \nto seeks out honest people to flirt with. Unfortunately, this assertion is unsubstantiated \nwith empirical evidence and not supported with a solid theoretical argument. In \ncontrast to this claim, empirical research has found that lying is often expected and \ncan provide a space to experiment with one\u2019s identity (Whitty & Gavin, 2001). For \nexample, this 29 year old male stated in a previous study that: \n\"You also lose the ability to be able to judge people\u2019s honesty effectively. It\u2019s a lot \neasier to do that in person, um, but there\u2019s a certain advantage to it. You lose your \ninhibitions, your insecurities. You can talk a lot more easily to people. It\u2019s a bit of \nan even cut of pros and cons\". (Whitty & Gavin, 2001, p. 629) \nAs illustrated in this quote, this space between reality and fantasy has its \nbenefits. Online participants can inhabit any body they desire, whether that is a \nyouthful body, attractive body, or even the opposite sex. Moreover, the participant can \ninvent how their fantasy partner looks like, feels like, and feels about them. \nParticipants can fantasise that they are attracted to others, and in turn, others are \nattracted to them. Therefore, while one cannot be certain about the honesty of the \nother participants, this honesty can work to one\u2019s advantage. As illustrated in the \nfollowing extract from an interview with a 17 year old male: \n\u201cYou can never be sure that anyone you talk to on the Net is telling the truth so \nthere\u2019s very little trust. That can work both ways because you\u2019re free to be \n 14 \n \nwhatever you like, which means your not intimidated by what people think\u201d. \n(Whitty & Gavin, 2001, p. 629) \n \nThis extract demonstrates a paradox \u2014 that \u2018trust can cut both ways\u2019. In other \nwords, while participants are unable to trust whether another is presenting them with \nthe empirical truth, this space is nonetheless an environment they can trust to be safe \nto experiment with different aspects of his self. Trust is an important aspect in \nWinnicott\u2019s theory. According to him, a potential space is a safe space where \nexperimentation can take place. As we noted earlier, in this space an individual can \nexperiment with what is 'me' and what is 'not-me' through transitional objects. \nWinnicott (1971\/1997) asserted that \"when we witness an infant's employment of a \ntransitional object, the first not-me possession, we are witnessing both the child's first \nuse of a symbol and the first experience of play\" (p. 96). \nRecently, Christopher Bollas (1987; 1992) has extended Winnicott's work with \na suggestion that the transitional objects, like all objects, themselves leave a trace \nwithin us. Bollas (1992, p. 59) argues that \"as we encounter the object world \u2026 we \nare substantially metamorphosed by the structure of objects; internally transformed by \nobjects that leave their trace within us\". Some objects seem to have much more inner \nmeaning for us and unlock unconscious thought processes and affective states. In a \nsense, Bollas argues, these objects are \"transformational\" and may act like \"psychic \nkeys\" (see also Carr, in press). The object themselves, in acting as psychic keys, \nappear to enable past unconscious experiences to be released to inform present \nbehaviour. In respect to online interactions, we would suggest that the transitional \nobjects such as, the computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, modems, and so forth \n\"leave a trace\" within us. Once we log on, it is as if we must acknowledge \"the rules\" \nof the game of cyber-flirting. Playing at love online, is restrained by certain rules; \nsome of these rules have been imposed from people's understandings of offline \nflirting, however many new rules have evolved in order for online interactions to take \nplace.  \nGiven the paucity of empirical data available on cyber-flirting, we could not \ndo justice to an in-depth discussion of these rules. However, it is worthwhile giving \nsome thought to what these rules might entail. For example, do the same gender rules \nthat have been established offline in respect to flirtatious behaviour also apply online? \nMoreover, given the greater opportunity to interact with individuals from a plethora of \n 15 \n \ndifferent cultures online, what happens when cultures collide \u2013 what delineates cyber-\nflirting in these circumstances? For example, do emoticons represent the same \nmeanings to people from all cultures? Indeed, does cyber-encountering have a \ndifferent language and culture of its own that transcends existing geographical and \ncultural boundaries in a way that is very distinctive? \nIt has been observed that some relationships that begin on the Internet often \nextend beyond it (e.g., Parks & Floyd, 1996; Parks & Roberts, 1998; Whitty & Gavin, \n2001). It might therefore be argued that the \u2018game is over\u2019 once the couple decides to \nintroduce more social cues to the interaction. This is not to say that cyber-interactions \nare not intimate, but rather the illusion of the body that was constructed through the \ntext becomes deconstructed once more is known about the \u2018actual\u2019 body. Just as with \ncourtly love \u2013 the magic possibly leaves the relationship once it moves beyond this \nspace. \nBen-Ze\u2019ev (2002) argues that:  \nFlirting is conducted within a tacit borderline, and a kind of game takes place in \nwhich participants move closer to the borderline \u2014 and sometimes even step \nacross it \u2014 and then move back to a comfortable distance within it. Flirting is like \nan inactive volcano that can become active any moment. In online affairs, crossing \nthe line between innocent flirting and overt sexual interaction, and hence activating \nthe volcano, is greatly facilitated as the stimulation is high and the typical warning \nsignals that alert people to infidelity \u2014 e.g., nonverbal signs of discomfort or \nshame \u2014 are not apparent in cyberspace. \nBen-Ze\u2019ev suggests that cyber-sex is different to cyber-flirting. However, \nwhat is difficult to establish is where does the border between cyber-flirting and \ncyber-sex exists. Is there a linear relationship? In respect to the cyber-flirter\u2019s partner \nis cyber-flirting also seen as an act of betrayal? Research to date has revealed that \nthere are separate components that we need to consider in respect to Internet \ninfidelity, these being sexual, emotional and pornography (Whitty, 2002b). We might \nneed to consider these dimensions in future research in respect to how far our play can \ngo online without creating conflict in our offline relationships. \nArising from the conceptual framework that we are advancing in this article, \nfuture research might also consider what happens when we lose our Internet \ntransitional objects. \n 16 \n \nWith the transitional object, the infant can play with the illusion of his own \nomnipotence (lessening the loss of the environment-mother with generative and \nphasic delusions of self-and-other creation); he can entertain the idea of the object \nbeing got rid of, yet surviving his ruthlessness; and he can find in this transitional \nexperience the freedom of metaphor. (Bollas, 1987, p.15) \nBollas\u2019 (1987) assertion has certain implications for cyber-flirting. Winnicott \ndiscussed the ramifications of taking a (transitional) transformational object away \nfrom a child or altering this object in some way (e.g., washing the child\u2019s blanket). In \nturn, psychologists might need to be mindful of the implications of losing Internet \ntransitional objects (e.g., deleting the text of past exchanges or losing the object of \none\u2019s Internet affections). \nIt is also noteworthy that Bollas (1992) has also contended that: \nWere we to study this psychology of generations closely, it would be of interest to \ncontrast the nature of generational potential spaces, to note those objects selected \nas signature of a generations consciousness, and to analyse the field of such objects \nas unconscious ideas that may be generative or pathological. (p.266) \nHe further argues that generational objects weave into historic time. Bollas (1992, p. \n267) argues that: \"Generations form objects that signify the history of childhoods, that \nspeak to the collective march through time of a vast group expecting and expected to \nshape history\". Although it is too early to tell, in decades to come we might look back \nover the objects, such as computers, modems, keyboards and so forth, and, in \nretrospective, see these items are signifying meaning for a particular generation in \nhistory. Thus it must be considered that cyberspace might not always provide the \npotential space for playing at love as described in this paper4. \n \nDoes all cyber-flirting promote psychological growth? \n \n\u201cJust as cyberspace may potentiate, it may also thwart and debilitate\u201d (Civin, \n2000, p.40). Civin raises and important issue that warrants further discussion. Earlier \nwe defined potential space as a space that is the gap between fantasy and reality. One \nmight like to consider the question: What impact does cyber-flirting have on an \nindividual if they stray too close to the borders of reality or fantasy? \n \n 17 \n \nWhile Turkle (1996) has found few problems with in the use of cyberspace as \npotential space, Civin (2000) has emphatically disagreed. He instead proposes that \n\u201cthe transitional and facilitative nature of the use of cyberspace as potential space is \nmuch less of a given than Turkle might be suggesting \u2026 that no object or process, the \ncyber system included is essentially transitional\u201d (pp. 38-39). Civin continues this line \nof argument reminding the reader that Winnicott was not suggesting that all teddy \nbears and blankets are essentially transitional! Likewise, not all cyber systems will act \nas transitional objects! Civin adds, that in stark contrast, cyber systems are potentially \ninvasive, so much so that they can foster persecutory anxiety. Civin states, that for \nsome, \u201cthe computer system seems a far cry (in all meanings) from the teddy bear or \nfavorite blanket, and the breach between the cyber system and the transitional or \npotential looms unnegotiably vast\u201d (2000, p. 51). \nCivin (2000) presents the reader with case studies to illustrate how the cyber \nsystem can foster persecutory anxiety. For example, in his presentation of the online \nexperiences of a person he calls Jeannette, Civin demonstrates how she was \neventually forced off the net after she angered someone for sharing software he had \nsent to her. This rage changed to jealousy and Jeannette found she was being emailed \nmore frequently than she could cope with and, in addition, feared her husband would \neventually discover her online relationships. \nAlthough cyberspace offers a potential space where, putatively, gender roles \ncould be transcended \u2014 as people play at love, this is does not always eventuate5. \nWhile Turkle (1996) suggested that this is fairly common, more recent empirical data \nsuggests that experimentation with one\u2019s physical appearance online does not occur as \nfrequently as one might expect (e.g., Cooper, Delmonico & Burg, 2000; Roberts & \nParks, 2001; Whitty, 2002a). \nThe deleterious effects that cyber-flirting can have on an individual also needs \nto be considered. In this article, we have made the claim that cyberspace can provide a \nsafe place to play at love. However, both the media and recent research has revealed \nthat it is not a safe place for everyone, and if too much is revealed about oneself it can \nbecome quite a dangerous place. Therefore, it could be said that one person\u2019s \nexperience of flirting could turn into another person\u2019s experience of harassment (see \nYelington, 1996, 1999 for an in-depth discussion on the link between offline flirting \nand sexual harassment). This is exemplified in a thirteen year old women\u2019s experience \nof a cyber-affair (Tarbox, 2000). Initially this young women, named Katie, welcomed \n 18 \n \nthe attention she received from a much older man online, however, this later became a \nsource of regret. According to Katie, it was a lack of understanding from others that \nwas the impetus behind her going online to seek others who would understand her. \nAlthough she was unimpressed by many of the men she encountered online, she still \npersisted in seeking out someone like-minded. To quote from Katie: \n\u201cAnd they all want to know what you look like, especially your body. You can \nbe sure that every time you go on-line someone is going to ask you your breast \nsize. I don\u2019t really see why anyone bothers to ask. Everyone lies when they answer. \n \nIt didn\u2019t take me long to figure out that a lot of the guys in the teen chat rooms \nwere not normal guys. They were animals that wanted to be excited by someone \nthey thought looked like Cindy Crawford with a breast size of 36F. \n \nDespite all of this \u2013 despite all of the weirdos and the creepy feeling of being \ndetached from reality \u2013 a small part of me believed that there was someone out \nthere on the Web like me\u201d. (Tarbox, 2000, p. 25-26) \n \nEventually Katie did meet someone she felt resonated with her sense of self. \nHe claimed to be a 23 year old called Mark, and the two discussed in detail favourite \nfashions. What she didn\u2019t know was that he was older, his name was not Mark and he \nwas a paedophile. Mark remained an online friend, and Katie purports that the two \nbecame so close that he eventually replaced her best girlfriend as her closest \nconfidant. About a year from when they first meet online Katie gave in to Mark\u2019s \nconstant requests to meet her (she had been careful not to give out her address or last \nname) and arranged to meet him while she was away in another city with her \nswimming team and their parents. They met in the hotel where she was staying, and \nMark managed to persuade Katie to go back to his hotel room. He did in fact attempt \nto assault her, however fortunately for Katie, one of her friends had followed her \n(without her knowing) and called her mother for assistance. While Katie avoided \nbeing assaulted, as one might imagine, the ramifications of this event for Katie were \npsychologically damaging for her. \nCyberstalking is a type of harassment that is increasingly being reported. \nMcGrath and Casey (2002) have defined cyberstalking as \u201cStalking is the repeated \nuninvited monitoring and\/or intrusion into the life and activities of a victim that is \n 19 \n \nusually, but not always, undertaken for the purpose of frightening or intimidating the \nvictim or those around the victim\u2026Cyberstalking is merely stalking that uses the \nInternet for information gathering, monitoring, and\/or victim contact\" (p. 88-89). One \nof the earliest, and more extreme, cases of cyberstalking occurred in the late 1990s, \nwhen a security guard was rejected by a woman he met in church. His vengeful act \nincluded placing adverts on the Internet in her name claiming that she was into \u201crape \nfantasy and gang-bang fantasy\u2026the adverts included a detailed physical description, \nher address and phone number and even instructions on how to bypass her burglar \nalarm\u201d (Gumbel, 1999). This woman was woken up at night by men pounding on her \ndoor yelling they were going to rape her. Another more common example of \ncyberstalking in the public domain is where ex-lovers put on the web, or send emails \nto friends of embarrassing and humiliating photos and details about the person they \nfell out with. Another more famous case is the Mr Bungle affair that occurred in 1992 \nin Lambda MOO (see Turkle, 1996). In cyberspace a player masqueraded as another \nplayer\u2019s character by using a MUD programming technique often referred to as a \nvoodoo doll. The Mr Bungle character used the voodoo doll to force another character \nto perform sexual acts on him \u2013 this incident is now commonly referred to as the first \nrape in cyberspace. \nIn addition to these case studies, empirical research is finding that online \nharassment is causing problems, for women in particular, in online settings, including \nworkplace online spaces. For example in Whitty\u2019s (2002c) recent Australia-wide \nstudy, 17% of participants stated that they had been harassed in emails in their \nworkplace. Whitty and Gavin (2001) found that a number of the women they \ninterviewed (especially the younger women) stated that they had experienced \nproblems with being harassed in chat rooms and were sometimes cyberstalked. For \nexample, one young woman stated: \"Oh yeah. Some people just think it\u2019s open \nslaughter on young girls on the net and come meet me at such and such a place and \nyou\u2019re like yeah right I don\u2019t think so. You just don\u2019t give out too much information. \nYou cover yourself\". It has also been observed that young women, in particular, are \nstating that they are needing to lie about details about themselves (e.g., age, looks, \nwhere they live) in order to avoid harassment both offline and online (Whitty 2002b). \n \n \n \n 20 \n \nTherapeutic implications \n \nDespite these negative experiences online and the realisation that not all \ncyberspace is potential space, we believe that further researcher into cyber-flirting \ncould have some important therapeutic implications. Since Freud, psychoanalytic \nthinkers have been interested in the psychology of romance. As Lindholm (1988) \npoints out, in Freud\u2019s later writings he was interested in the loved one as being a \nsubstitute for an unattained ego ideal that we maintain. \u201cWhen this idea is found, \nboundaries between the self and other melt \u2026 the romantic lover seeks identification \nwith an external object, and identification offering a cathartic return to merger with \nthe engulfing other\u2026\u201d (Lindholm, 1988, p. 28; for a similar approach see also Carr & \nZanetti, 1999). We suggest that psychoanalytic theories of narcissism and identity \ncould be extended to include cyber-romances. \nWhile we contend that his type of play has significant implications for \ntherapeutic outcomes, we also recognise that the potential for psychopathologies to \ndevelop from this activity cannot be discounted. For example recent studies have \nincreasingly focused on cyber-sex as a compulsive disorder (e.g., Cooper, Delmonico \n& Burg, 2000). Bollas (1987) has described how the search for the idealised lover can \nbe a quest to find a deficiency in the ego. As he states  \nSome forms of erotomania may be efforts to establish the other as the \ntransformational object. The search for the perfect crime or the perfect woman is \nnot only a quest for an idealized object. It also constitutes some recognition in the \nsubject of a deficiency in ego experience. The search, even though it serves to split \nthe bad experience from the subject\u2019s cognitive knowledge, is nonetheless a \nsemiological act that signifies the person\u2019s search for a particular object relation \nthat is associated with ego transformation and repair of the \u2018basic fault\u2019. (Bollas, \n1987, p.18).  \nTo conclude, we trust that this article provides a way forward in our thinking \nabout cyberspace \u2014 including its vices, and potential therapeutic benefits it has to \noffer. Although cyber-flirting is based on elements of physical reality, read through \nthe optic of Winnicott's object-relation theory this illusion must be sustained in this \nspace if one is to \u2018play at love\u2019. \n \ne \nReferences \n \nAndrew.

We recognise that there are different spaces on the \nInternet and, it is most likely, that Winnicott\u2019s notions of potential space are more \napplicable to some of these spaces, rather than all of cyberspace. Spaces such as \nMUDs and MOOs (multiple-user dungeon, or more commonly understood these days \nto mean multi-user dimension or domains) which were originally a space where \ninteractive role-playing games could be played, very similar to Dungeons and \nDragons. In this space we find people experimenting with and playing with multiple \ncharacters (see White, 2001). Chat rooms are another different space where we can \nsee evidence of flirting in some of the screen names people select (e.g., CallMeBaBy; \nPimpDadE4eva; Winker). Individuals in these rooms have a space where the risk of \nshame and humiliation are significantly less than interacting with an individual \noffline, since one can ensure anonymity. Spaces such as newsgroups possibly create \nless opportunity for individuals to cyber-flirt. Newsgroups are a space on the Internet \ndevoted to the discussion of a specific topic. Unlike chat rooms and MUDs and \nMOOs, the textual exchanges are typically asynchronous. The type of topic and \nwhether people reveal who they really are can alter the dynamics of such as space. \n \nA full discussion of this aspect of cyberspace is beyond what the word length that this \narticle will allow, but clearly further investigation would appear necessary to \nunderstand the psychological processes that may occur because these spaces on the \nweb are of different character. \n \n \n5 While a full discussion on gender relations is beyond the scope of this paper, we \nwould like to acknowledge Yelington\u2019s (1996, 1999) papers on flirting which have \nfocused on the relations between men and women factory workers in Trinidad. \nYelington contends that \u201cWhile women\u2019s flirting may bring them [men] pleasure or \nbuy them time, over time it tends to reinforce the society\u2019s gender double standards; \nmen\u2019s reputations, on the other hand, are not besmirched, by flirting\u201d (Yelington, \n1999, p. 547). A question we propose for future thinking about cyber-flirting is \nwhether these power relations can be transcended online. For instance, cyber-flirting \nmight be more akin to the game of flirting that Osella and Osella (1998) delineate in \nrespect to offline flirtation. \n"}
