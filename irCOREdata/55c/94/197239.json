As underlined in a recent editorial in Nature Medicine, an \noperational approach is needed to achieve this goal2. Bioresources such as biobanks, databases and \nbioinformatics tools are important elements in this landscape. Bioresources need to be easily accessible to \nfacilitate advancement of research. Besides technical and ethical aspects, a major obstacle for sharing them is the \nabsence of recognition of the effort behind establishing and maintaining such resources. The main objective of \nproposing a Bioresource Research Impact Factor (BRIF) is to promote the sharing of bioresources by creating a \nlink between their initiators\/implementers and the impact of scientific research using them3. A BRIF would make \nit possible to trace the quantitative use of a bioresource, the kind of research utilizing it, and the efforts of people \nand institutions that construct it and make it available. \nIn the context of EU projects, a BRIF working group has been set up, including so far 97 participants \n(http:\/\/www.gen2phen.org\/groups\/brif-bio-resource-impact-factor). The work involves several steps: creating a \nunique identifier, standardizing bioresource acknowledgement in papers, cataloging bioresource data access and \nsharing policies, identifying other parameters to take into account and prototype testing with the help of \nvolunteer bioresources and journal editors. \n \nThe first BRIF workshop was held in Toulouse, France (17-18 January 2011), gathering 34 people from 10 \ncountries, representing various domains: biobanks, genome databases, epidemiological longitudinal cohorts, \nbioinformatics, scientific publishing, bibliometry, health law and bioethics \n(http:\/\/precedings.nature.com\/collections\/brif-workshop-january-2011). The lack of objective measures of use of \nbioresources was recognized by all; we focused on shared aims, but underlined that each community had specific \naspects to consider and resolve. \n \nMain avenues explored and further steps \nBioresources need to be identified by a unique digital identifier (ID), ideally via existing mechanisms4. Digital \nObject Identifiers (DOIs) may be interesting (http:\/\/www.doi.org). Several issues must be considered, including: \nwhat to identify (biobank, collection, database, dataset, subset and version); identifier requirements (persistent \nover time, globally-unique, citable); and which international and independent body should be responsible for \nassigning bioresource IDs. Working subgroups were created to address those questions. Attribution of credit to \nscientists for different kinds of work (in addition to publications) using researcher IDs was also discussed. The \nORCID initiative (http:\/\/www.orcid.org) is building a new contributor ID framework which should in principle \nenable credit to be given to both bioresources and individuals involved in their creation and maintenance. \nStandardization of citation is necessary, but could be combined with existing referencing standards and \nconventions5, such as: citing marker papers, standardized sentences in Materials & Methods or \nacknowledgements section of papers, co-authorship when justified, and including resource name in paper title. \nSpecific requirements for citing bioresources are lacking in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts submitted \nto Biomedical Journals (http:\/\/www.icmje.org\/urm_main.html, version April 2010) and should be added. In \norder to enable automated tracking of bioresource use, the bioresource ID should ideally appear in or under the \nabstract section in order to be visible even without access to the full text of articles. \nBRIF should not be a citation index only. Factors such as time and domain of bioresources need to be considered \nin the calculation process and its weighting. Although the BRIF scope could be extended to measure many \ndifferent aspects of bioresource utilization, including economic implications, it was decided to concentrate first \non use and impact in research settings. \nAccess and sharing policies  have been developed over years6. However, the incentivisation of bioresources to \npromote access needs to be balanced with appropriate provisions compatible with all stakeholder interests, that \nis, proper recognition of scientific contribution and sustainability supported by the capacity of measuring their \nown resource use and impact. There are actually no mechanisms in place to measure this impact. Empowering \nbioresources with tools such as BRIF is, therefore, urgent. \n \nThe full impact of bioresources is wider than BRIF, but unique bioresource identifiers and metrics must be \nestablished as the first operational step. The present proliferation of ideas, statements and proposals around data \n 2 \nsharing from different perspectives and stakeholders1,2,3,7  favors the implementation of tools such as BRIF in \norder to make data sharing principles operational. Workshop participants and members of the working group \nurge concerned stakeholders to join our efforts in developing such an instrument. \n \nAuthors\u2019 Email addresses \nA.
