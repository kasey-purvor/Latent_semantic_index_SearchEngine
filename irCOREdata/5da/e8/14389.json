However,\nempirical investigations of their use in online education are limited. Our aim is to provide an empir-\nically based framework for the development and evaluation of animated agents in e-learning\nenvironments. Findings suggest a number of challenges, including the multiple dialogue models\nthat animated agents will need to accommodate, the diverse range of roles that pedagogical\nanimated agents can usefully support, the dichotomous relationship that emerges between these\nroles and that of the lecturer, and student perception of the degree of autonomy that can be afforded\nto animated agents.\nIntroduction\nA new educational paradigm is emerging: face-to-face interaction with intelligent\npedagogical animated agents in interactive learning environments that are capable of\nperforming tasks and achieving goals individually and in collaboration with human and\nnon-human agents. Currently, significant work has been undertaken on incorporating\nconversational behaviours of emotion, personality, conversational performatives and\nfunctions into such agents (Cassell et al., 2000; Ruttkay & Pelachaud, 2004).\nHowever, little empirical work exists on their utility from the end user perspective.\nThat which does exist, while insightful, focuses on the expressiveness of animated\nagents rather than the functionality that end users may require from them (Lester et al.,\n1997). Using an interpretive case study approach, this research has developed a frame-\nwork for pedagogical animated agent evaluation that focuses on end-user-defined\nfunctional requirements. The research participants were early adopters of animated\nagent technologies within e-learning environments at a Malaysian university.\n*Corresponding author.

Ferneley\nBackground\nThere is a growing body of literature relating to e-learning including research on the\nadoption of courseware (Russell, 1999), learner experiences with e-learning (Hara &\nKling, 1999; Johnson et al., 2000a) and the comparison of the critical attributes of\ntraditional and e-learning environments (Blignauta & Trollipa, 2003). Increasingly\nsophisticated features are being conceptualised and incorporated in e-learning\nsystems such as intelligent agents (Lester et al., 2000; Schroeder, 2002), adaptive\nhypermedia (Ng et al., 2002) and game-based learning (Foreman, 2004) that aim to\nmake e-learning friendly and engaging for both instructors and learners.\nThe inclusion of intelligent agent technology in e-learning environments has been\nof growing interest (Conole, 2002; Logan et al., 2002; Songa et al., 2004). Intelligent\nagents are computer programs that can act autonomously and perform tasks intelli-\ngently with consideration given to context and user preferences. They support the\nuser in carrying out computerised tasks such as information searching, meeting\nscheduling or online purchasing (Maes, 1994). Advances in computer graphics have\nmade the embodiment of intelligent agents (known as animated agents) possible\n(Schroeder, 2002) and e-learning researchers have proposed the utilisation of\nanimated agents to reduce the overheads involved in delivering online education, to\nfacilitate dynamic monitoring of course activities and delegation of certain instructor\ntasks to pedagogical animated agents (Johnson et al., 2000b; Conole, 2002; Jafari,\n2002; Songa et al., 2004). The expectation is that learners will be able to interact visu-\nally with pedagogical animated agents who will be able to exhibit emotive behaviour\nand expressions and simulate continuous instructor presence in e-learning environ-\nments. This notion is in line with the futuristic vision of the Peripatetic Electronic\nTeacher, as coined by Squires (1999), the freelance educator providing education\nvirtually on demand with their routine tasks supported or delivered by agent-based\ntechnology that will be required to operate in four key roles or \u2018presences\u2019: as a peda-\ngogical presence, in a managerial role as a professional (usually in some peer group\nsetting) or in a commercial role as a personal marketeer. In the 1990s animated agents\nwere developed to support students in the use of educational programs; for example,\nHerman the Bug (Lester et al., 1999), Steve\u2014Soar Training Expert for Virtual\nEnvironments (Rickel & Johnson, 1999) and Adele\u2014Agent for Distance Learning\n(Shaw et al., 1999). However, there is now a sense of urgency in identifying how to\nincorporate pedagogical agent technology appropriately in e-learning environments.\nWhile a utopian vision may exist of learners interacting seamlessly with pedagogi-\ncal animated agents, in practice animation can be irritating and empirical investiga-\ntions have revealed diverse results in a continuum from animated agents being\nhelpful to them being distracting and hampering the learning process (Dehn &\nMulken, 2000; Ruttkay & Pelachaud, 2004). Additionally, there are concerns\nregarding their pedagogical value, with no clear evidence that they can enhance\ncommunication or understanding (Dehn, 2000; Moundridou & Virvou, 2002).\nHence their contribution to the efficiency and effectiveness of learning continues to\nbe an open research agenda.\nUse of animated agents in e-learning environments 155\nTherefore, this paper can be seen as a response to the question: \u2018what kind of\nanimated agent used in what kind of domain influences what aspects of the user\u2019s\nattitudes or performance?\u2019 (Dehn & Mulken, 2000, p. 19). It will involve examin-\ning the application of pedagogical animated agents in e-learning environments.\nSince the question has multiple components, this paper investigates only the final\nportion, providing additional insights into learners\u2019 perceptions of the utility of\nanimated agents in e-learning environments. The key result of the research is a\nconceptual design and evaluation framework for the incorporation of animated\nagents in e-learning environments.\nMethodology\nExamining the use of pedagogical animated agents requires investigation from multi-\nple stakeholder perspectives (e.g. lecturers, undergraduate and postgraduate\nstudents) and an understanding of the social and contextual relationships that\ninfluence the stakeholders\u2014there can be no single explanation of success. Our epis-\ntemological assumptions are that no individual account of social reality can be proven\ncorrect. Therefore, as the fundamental nature of this study is concerned with inter-\npreting human action and perceptions, the researchers drew on an interpretive and\nqualitative research tradition in order to explore and understand the perspectives of\nthe various stakeholders and the historical and socially situated contexts in which they\nreside (Walsham, 1995; Klein & Myers, 1999). The usual approach to gaining such\nunderstanding (or \u2018rich insight\u2019), particularly where the phenomena cannot be stud-\nied outside of the context in which it occurs, is an observation-based case study\napproach (Walsham, 1993; Yin, 1994).\nThe case study was conducted in the Information Systems department at a private\nuniversity in Malaysia. The department has made extensive use of e-learning facili-\nties, offering as part of its degree programme full online modules and blended learn-\ning modules since 2000. Since the adoption of e-learning facilities, staff have\nincorporated a variety of animated agents into their online materials, including\nanimated instructional agents developed using Microsoft Agent\u2122 (Microsoft, 2006),\nthe demonstration and problem-solving animated agents Steve and Adele (Rickel &\nJohnson, 1999; Shaw et al., 1999) and information search and retrieval agents such\nas Gossip (Tryllian, 2006). Case study data were collected by the first author who is\nan academic member of staff at the institution and a native Malaysian, speaking the\nlanguage of the participants. This \u2018insider\u2019 perspective expedited data collection and\nenabled a deeper understanding of the issues raised. The research design process was\nexecuted in phases (Yin, 2003).\nFirst phase: planning and preparation\nIn undertaking qualitative research, there is more than one way in which it may be\nperformed, as Markus underlined: \n156 A. K. Mahmood and E. Ferneley\nIf we who claim to understand qualitative research argue that there is only one right way\nto do it, we are deliberately blinding ourselves to many interesting and important research\nquestions and phenomena. (1997, p. 15)\nIn this study the planning and preparation phase began with a detailed literature\nreview. Three seed research questions were explored: \n\u25cf What roles can animated agents effectively assume in e-learning environments?\n\u25cf When, how and for whom would those roles be initiated?\n\u25cf Do social and cultural factors influence the interaction between the users and\nanimated agents?\nA conceptual framework was developed, founded on the research questions (Miles &\nHuberman, 1994). This framework acted as the stimuli for data collection. Briefly the\nframework consisted of the following: \n\u25cf Learner characteristics\u2014including, learning style (visual, auditory or kinaesthetic;\nSabry & Baldwin, 2003); system experience (Holscherl & Strubel, 2000), prior\nknowledge and spatial ability (Mayer & Gallini, 1990) and occupational experi-\nence (Durling et al., 1996).\n\u25cf Technology\u2014the various technologies and mediums used to deliver and commu-\nnicate with the learners, including speech, text, sound and animated agent\nexpression.\n\u25cf Learning environment\u2014physical attributes including monitor size, microphone\nand speaker position and room layout; and virtual attributes including look and feel\nof the applications, courseware content and structure.\n\u25cf Culture\u2014the users\u2019 enacted system of beliefs, symbols and behaviours; and collec-\ntive programming of the mind such as the learning of ideas, habits, attitudes,\ncustoms and traditions (Hofstede, 1991).\nSecond phase: fieldwork\nData were collected over a 12-month period using participant observation and indi-\nvidual and group interviews. All participants were from the Malaysian university\u2019s\nInformation Systems department. Twenty-six interviewees were involved in 21\nseparate sessions: six individual lecturer interviews, four individual postgraduate\ninterviews, one group postgraduate interview (two participants), eight individual\nundergraduate interviews and two group undergraduate interviews (three partici-\npants in each group interview). While the majority of interviews were individual, three\nsmall group interview sessions were undertaken with students to explore whether\ndifferent issues emerged, although no significantly different issues did. Interviews\nbegan with more generic questioning allowing users to express their opinions on the\nuse of pedagogical animated agents before moving to more specific issues to ensure\nthat data from each interview covered similar areas thus allowing cross-respondent\ncomparison. Data collection ceased at the point of data saturation (Miles &\nHuberman, 1994). Simulated propositions were presented to the interviewees in the\nUse of animated agents in e-learning environments 157\nform of a series of small video clips from the Star Trek television series that showed\npossible future applications for animated agents. The aim was to allow discussion of\npossible future scenarios but to \u2018bound\u2019 the discussion and give some direction to\nrespondents to allow cross-respondent comparison. The videos included examples of\nanimated agents on Star Trek\u2019s holodeck and embedded agents in Star Trek\u2019s engi-\nneering department.\nThe sampling approach for choosing the interviewees was driven by the emerging\nthemes. The aim was not to capture the representativeness of the population, but\nrather to continuously solicit and analyse the \u2018hows\u2019 of meaning and the \u2018whats\u2019 of\ninterviewees\u2019 experiences until the findings were either being reinforced or emergent\nissues were saturated. During both the observation sessions and interviews the\nresearcher took field notes, highlighting potential emergent themes. All interviews\nwere video-recorded and conducted in the language and style of expression that was\nmost convenient for the interviewees to convey meaning, which at times was a mix of\nEnglish and Malay. Interviews lasted between 50 minutes and 2 hours 20 minutes.\nTable 1 provides an overview of the structure, format and issues covered in the inter-\nviews, although this is only indicative as an open rather than closed questioning style\nwas used.\nThird and fourth phases: summarising and aggregating the data\nFull transcripts were made of all interview sessions, and summaries were made of all\nobservational sessions. Using an inductive analytical approach an initial coding\nscheme derived from the initial, literature-based, conceptual framework was further\nexplored and refined by application of the case study data, providing a \u2018behavioural\ndescription\u2019 of the use of pedagogical animated agents (Miles & Huberman, 1994).\nAs coding progressed a number of themes began to emerge; namely, the various roles\nthat pedagogical animated agents could assume, the various effects that pedagogical\nanimated agents have on users and context and cultural factors that may influence\nuser interaction. Because qualitative data analysis is an open and iterative process,\napplying the initial coding scheme to the case studies resulted in the emergence or\ninduction of a richer coding set as the initial codes were \u2018extended\u2019, \u2018filled in\u2019,\n\u2018bridged\u2019 and \u2018surfaced\u2019 (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). For illustration, the \u2018roles\u2019 cluster\nevolved to include a set of subclusters including the roles of personal assistant,\ndemonstrator, counsellor and peer (see also Table 2). Validation of the coding\nscheme was undertaken by gaining feedback from interviewees and the co-researcher\nand by applying the principles of the hermeneutic cycle (Klein & Myers, 1999).\nQualitative data analysis software was used to assist in the coding process. These\nsubclusters are supported by various logical chains of evidence matrices. For illustra-\ntion, an extract from the role-ordered matrix that shows a subset of the emergent roles\nis presented in Table 2. The role-order matrix was created by extracting the various\nrequirements and issues that each type of respondent identified as factors in the use\nof pedagogical animated agents. For illustration and due to space limitations only one\nor two requirements\/issues are presented for each cell within the role-order matrix.\n158 A. K. Mahmood and E.

The instantiation of these roles was viewed very differently by\nacademic and student respondents. Considering Squire\u2019s (1999, p. 54) four \u2018presence\u2019\ndomains, broadly, students focused on animated agents providing a pedagogical pres-\nence, while academics expected animated agents to assume a managerial stance.\nNeither user group considered Squires\u2019s professional or commercial perspectives\u2014\nfor example, animated agents as representatives at academic meetings or animated\nagents in some form of marketing or sales role.\nLecture perspective.   Lecturers were willing to, and many did, delegate laborious,\nroutine \u2018low-risk\u2019 tasks to animated agents, including searching for academic\nand administrative information, managing appointments and replying to non-crucial\ne-mails. One of the lecturers stated: \nIf the agents can do half of my routine tasks, that would be nice \u2026 as an academic, I can\nspend that valuable spare time for more productive activities. I don\u2019t mind if those routine\ntasks are handled by agents.\nHowever, they identified the major barrier to adoption included the time overhead\nrequired to gain familiarity with the technology, the training curve required by agent\ntechnologies and past unsatisfactory results from using agents\nFor more advanced roles it was recognised that a more constructivist, learner-\ncentred approach to education would benefit students and that pedagogical animated\nagents can operate as a \u2018guide-on-the-side\u2019. For example, animated agents explaining\nsubject matter in an alternative way, rephrasing the material and providing alternative\ndiagrams, animations and texts to support the student\u2019s learning style had been\ntrialled and were discussed. A lecturer stated: \nThe agents should be able to explain in different ways \u2026 the agent should be able to\ncapture, rephrase and reinforce answers or questions.\nConcern was expressed that learners do not trust the technology, that their atten-\ntion may wane, that animated agents may tarnish the image of the lecturer, especially\nwhen the agents have a strong association with the lecturer, that possible negative\neffects on lecturer\u2013student relationships may ensue and that animated agents may\npose a potential threat to teaching careers. Additionally, interviewees were concerned\nthat animated agents were a passing fad and they had neither the time nor the ability\nto change their teaching styles to fully incorporate them into their online courses,\nespecially if animated agents were required to present an alternative pedagogical\napproach to the material being delivered.\n162 A. K. Mahmood and E. Ferneley\nStudent perspective.   Postgraduates were not interested in animated agent aesthetics.\nFor example: \nIf it fails to deliver I am not going to use it. Look is secondary\u2014it is the practicality, speed\nand quality of response that count.\nThey focused on the possibility of advanced animated agent roles such as advisor or\nmentor, as stated by one respondent, and typical of others: \nMy current problem as research student is how to understand what I read \u2026 interactive\nsoftware could help, maybe in terms of visualisations instead of just reading the literature.\nPotential animated agent roles were advanced with context specific requirements\nthat are at the boundaries of current technology. They proposed a mediating role of\n\u2018team buddy\u2019, providing support for groups of research postgraduates and stimulating\ncollaborative research or learning.\nUndergraduates focused on more informal animated agent roles to help them over-\ncome feelings such as shyness and inferiority, by engaging in a more open, informal\nenvironment, as stated by one respondent: \nAgents can actually help the student in a \u2018virtual way\u2019, there is no connection between\nlecturer and student, \u2026 can get the answers or help outside the classroom.\nUndergraduates also emphasised the need for 24-hour service, for repeated one-to-\none interaction on the same topic within a confidential environment and interaction\nat the intellectual level of the undergraduate\u2014a personalised user profile. This concept\nof service and personalisation was linked to interest retention, and analogies between\ngaming software and e-learning environments were repeatedly made; for example: \nI think if the animated software agents play their roles right, they can help to make the\ncourseware as interesting as the games software, and \u2026 retain the interest of the learner.\nFor example, we can revise the assignments to look more like games software rather than\nlike academic problems.\nDespite undergraduates\u2019 enthusiasm for animated agents there was concern that\nsuch technology could not sustain high motivation and engagement in learning. Such\nmotivational activity was regarded as a human process.\nSocial and cultural influences\nAs social and cultural influences are an intrinsic part of learning, the issue of cust-\nomisability that allows factors such as language, looks and communication styles to\nbe incorporated into an animated agents was raised. Culturally, the Malaysian\nrespondents focused on the inclusion of Asian characteristics into animated agent\ndesigns for reasons of \u2018national pride\u2019. Also, with respect to the Malaysian context,\nthere was a reluctance to express dissent, to query or be critical of academic author-\nity. The respondents saw the introduction of pedagogical animated agents as an\nopportunity to act in a less reserved fashion and adopt a more questioning, critical\nstyle of interaction. However, despite cultural factors being mentioned, it was\nUse of animated agents in e-learning environments 163\nrepeatedly stated that quality of interaction with animated agents was more relevant\nthan cultural identity.\nSocially, interviewees focused on animated agents being able to personalise their\ninteraction with learners dependent on a user\u2019s profile, considering attributes such as\npast interactions and learner style with the aim of improving interaction and simpli-\nfying steps towards understanding the subject under study. Interviewees also\nexpressed a desire for animated agents that used informal, friendly language, commu-\nnicating at the intellectual level of the user and taking the role of tutor, counsellor or\nbuddy rather than the more authoritarian lecturer stance. The role of entertainer was\nalso mentioned\u2014an animated agent that can identify when the user is bored, can\ndistract or even \u2018crack an academic joke\u2019: the overarching desire was for a high level\nof context dependent personalisation.\nAnimated agent design framework\nThe multiple academic and student perspectives were summarised in a framework for\nanimated agent design in e-learning environments. Figure 1 illustrates this framework\ngraphically using the qualitative data analysis NVivo Modeller software.\nFigure 1. Animated agent design framework\nFigure 1. Animated agent design framework\n164 A. K. Mahmood and E. Ferneley\nDiscussion\nPedagogical animated agents have many similarities with other work in intelligent\ntutoring systems and interactive e-learning environments including reasoning capa-\nbilities, user profiling, mechanisms for evolving with the user, pedagogical approach\nand the maintenance of a logical dialogue with the user (Cassell et al., 2000; Ruttkay\n& Pelachaud, 2004). However, previous research has drawn on empirical studies in\nother domains to identify the utility of pedagogical animated agents in e-learning\nenvironments. This in-depth case study research has been conducted with experi-\nenced e-learning users who had used pedagogical animated agents previously to\ndevelop a framework of key requirements for pedagogical animated agents in e-learn-\ning environments.\nAnimated agent roles\nA range of roles were identified that a pedagogical animated agent could assume:\nTutor, Personal Assistant, Lecturer, Buddy, Entertainer and Counsellor. As with any\nautonomous agent, the agent must be able to react dynamically with its environment\nwhile maintaining a coherent dialogue with the user. The possibility of assuming\nmultiple roles and, at the same time being embodied, raises particular challenges for\nthe animated agent designer.\nDialogue context.   The instructional goals may vary dependent on the animated\nagent\u2019s role and the stage in the dialogue. A dialogue model is required that considers\nboth the ultimate and immediate conversational goals. In a dynamic environment the\ndesign of the animated agent to allow seamless transfer between roles while maintain-\ning coherence will be particularly challenging. The designer may consider alternative\nembodiments allowing a range of non-verbal behaviours depending on role rather\nthan attempting to combine roles into a single animated agent.\nVisual context.   A key difficulty in animated agent design is the design of suitable\nnon-verbal behaviours; for example, appropriate changes in facial expression. In this\nstudy respondents repeatedly stated that the visual representation was secondary to\nservice quality, and therefore e-learning designers may be advised to utilise simplistic\nembodiments until the animated agent designers have further addressed issues of\nbelievability.\nPedagogical context.   Dependent on the animated agent\u2019s role, the pedagogical intent\nwill vary. While the capture of appropriate dialogue to support the more formal\nLecturer or Tutor roles may be time consuming, it is unlikely that there would be\nambiguity in meaning. However, if alternative pedagogical approaches and peer-type\nsupport is to be included then there is a key question regarding how the appropriate,\nalternative pedagogical structures will be captured. In order to support multiple roles,\nUse of animated agents in e-learning environments 165\nmultiple pedagogical perspectives (presumably captured from multiple academics)\nwould be required. This study highlighted a number of concerns from academics\nregarding engaging with such technology. If said technology presents pedagogical\nviews that do not concur with the academic user\u2019s perspective, the likelihood of adop-\ntion is significantly reduced. There is a dichotomy here between the utility of provid-\ning multiple animated agent roles and the likelihood of adoption by academics.\nAnimated agent service quality and usefulness\nUnsurprisingly the service quality and usefulness of animated agents emerged as a key\ntheme, specifically as respondents had previously experienced animated agents that\nwere distracting and annoying.\nPresence context.   Animated agents as a distraction or annoyance emerged, particu-\nlarly if inappropriate behaviours were assigned to them. The respondents, both\neducators and students, emphasised the desire to be in control of the animated\nagents, to be able to determine when to engage with them. Yet, from the educator and\nstudent perspectives the desire for control was pedagogically contradictory. Lecturers\nexpressed a desire for highly controlled agents that they could program in detail to\nstructure the learning process. Students similarly wished to control agent interaction\nand determine the role an animated agent should adopt dependent on context (e.g.\npeer, buddy or tutor). A key challenge for future designers is how to accommodate\nthese two views of where control should be located.\nProfile context.   For multiple, context-dependent roles and behaviours to occur a user\nprofiling approach would appear appropriate. A user\u2019s learning style, career history,\ninterests, attitudes and culture are all unique making their learning experience a\npersonal journey. To incorporate such attributes into a personalised agent has long\nbeen an aim in agent design (Maes, 1994) and is a vision that has been incorporated\ninto Squires\u2019 notion of the Peripatetic Electronic Teacher (Squires, 1999). However,\nthis utopian vision is still a long way from realisation, and pedagogical animated agent\ndevelopers need to face the challenge of integrating user profiling and agent technol-\nogy while both fields are still in their infancy.\nConclusions\nLearners are being confronted with an ever-increasing quantity of information while\nat the same time the distance between themselves and their educator becomes either\nphysically or conceptually greater. This \u2018gap\u2019 has been partially filled by e-learning\nenvironments. More recent research has moved towards the use of pedagogical\nanimated agents, focusing on conversational behaviours and design features (Cassell\net al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2000b; Ruttkay & Pelachaud, 2004). However, in order\nto achieve Squires\u2019s futuristic vision of the Peripatetic Electronic Teacher, a clearer\n166 A. K. Mahmood and E. Ferneley\nunderstanding of end users\u2019 expectations of pedagogical animated agents is required\n(Johnson et al., 2000a; Conole, 2002; Logan et al., 2002).\nThe research presented here has employed an in-depth interpretive case study\napproach to explore the issues surrounding the use of pedagogical animated agents in\ne-learning environments. The case study site has employed animated agents and e-\nlearning as part of their educational delivery strategy for over five years. While the\nlatest research on animated agents in e-learning environments has focused on design\nissues of believability and deictic behaviour, the participants in this research were\nmore concerned with exploiting the classic characteristics of intelligent agents, such\nas autonomy, proactiveness and social ability. The participants already had experi-\nence of pedagogical animated agents and repeatedly expressed concern that interface\nissues did not dominate to the expense of functional requirements. The research\nidentified three key themes for pedagogical animated agent development: the instan-\ntiation of multiple roles, quality of service and a user-profile-based approach. Taking\nthese three themes a number of issues arise: \n\u25cf Potential conflicting roles of the various animated agents. As a learner begins to\ninteract with multiple animated agents, how can a consistent dialogue model be\nmaintained?\n\u25cf Population of animated agents. In order to provide the quality of service, multiple\nexperts may be required to work collaboratively to populate the various animated\nagent roles; for example, to provide alternative pedagogical models on specific\ntopics. This has significant set-up cost implications. Dichotomously, lecturers\nwished to maintain personalised animated agents that presented their material in a\nparticular format and style.\n\u25cf Quality assurance procedures. If pedagogical animated agents are ultimately to be\nautonomous, proactive and socially agile then clearly defined quality assurance\nprocedures need to be put in place to ensure that the pedagogical integrity of the\nanimated agents is maintained.\n\u25cf Development of user profiles including learning styles, career background and\ninterests in order to develop a personalised presentation style. For example, in\norder to tailor learning to an individual\u2019s requirements it may be useful to know\nwhether they are typically classed as a visual, auditory or kinestatic learner. Yet,\nhow would a user profile be captured? For example, a learner will not necessarily\nknow which learning style is most appropriate for their needs while a pedagogical\nanimated agent will need to know how to present information to best effect depen-\ndent on the particular learner.\nThe issues raised highlight the speculative nature of this field and are based on a\nsingle case study. However, the case study respondents had been exposed to both e-\nlearning environments and pedagogical animated agents for some five years. While\nthe implications suggested here might not be applicable to the individuals outside this\nsample (Lee & Baskerville, 2003), the findings and suggestions, as in any case study,\nmay be useful for further study and act as a foundation for further longitudinal\nresearch.\nUse of animated agents in e-learning environments 167\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are greatly indebted to the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable\ncritiques and suggestions.
