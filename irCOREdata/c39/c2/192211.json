INTRODUCTION\nA prerequisite for helicopter controller design and eval-\nuation is an appropriate mathematical model. Unlike fixed-\nwing aircraft, the dynamic behaviour of a helicopter is very\ncomplex with strong fuselage-rotor coupling and inherent\nnonlinearities. To develop rational explanations for the dy-\nnamic behaviour of a helicopter and to facilitate flight control\nsystem design, it is often necessary to use a simplified\nmodel that is capable of capturing the main characteristics\nof the system\u2019s dynamic behaviour. This is achieved by\nlinearization with small perturbation theory [1]. It essentially\namounts to neglecting all except the linear terms in the Taylor\nseries expansions of the nonlinear model function about\nthe known trim point. The resulting linearized helicopter\ndynamic model is of the following state-space form:\nx\u02d9 = Ax+Bu+w (1)\nwhere A and B are known as the stability and control\nmatrices that are derived from the partial derivatives of the\nnonlinear model function (see [1]); x and u are respectively\nthe perturbed state and input about the known trim point.\nThe term w represents atmospheric and other disturbances\nwhich are assumed to be white Gaussian processes.\nThere are several approaches to model building. The so-\ncalled \u201cwhite-box\u201d approach starts from first principles and\na model is derived from basic physical laws that govern the\nbehaviour of the system. This approach works for simple\nexamples, but its complexity increases rapidly for real-world\nsystems such as the helicopter. The \u201cblack-box\u201d approach,\nsometimes known as system identification, generates a model\nbased entirely on the input\/output measurements of the\nP. Li, I. Postlethwaite and M. Turner are with the Department of En-\ngineering, University of Leicester, UK pl62@leicester.ac.uk,\nixp@leicester.ac.uk, mct6@leicester.ac.uk\nsystem without trying to model the internal physical mech-\nanisms of the system. The \u201cgrey-box\u201d approach is some-\nwhere between the aforementioned approaches and attempts\nto combine physical modelling with parameter estimation\ntechniques. In the latter approach, the system\u2019s equations are\nknown up to some unknown parameters and the problem of\nsystem modelling is transformed into a problem of parameter\nestimation. In general, a model obtained from a \u201cgrey-box\u201d\napproach has better physical interpretations and explanations\nwhen compared with those obtained from a \u201cblack-box\u201d\napproach.\nThe \u201cgrey-box\u201d approach is used in this paper for building\nhelicopter dynamic model (1). The order and structure of the\nmodel are first chosen from physical considerations subject to\nsome unknown parameters. Parameter estimation techniques\nare then used to determine the unknown parameters. The rest\nof the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the\nparameter estimation strategy used and simulation studies are\nperformed in Section III. The results of parameter estimation\nusing real flight test data are presented in Section IV, with\nconcluding remarks in Section V.\nII. PARAMETER ESTIMATION STRATEGY\nThe linearized helicopter dynamic model in (1) is in state-\nspace form, it is continuous-time and time-invariant. The\naim of modelling is to determine the stability and control\nmatrices A and B using the available measurements. The\nmeasurements needed for determination of such a model\ndepend on the structure and parameterization of the model.\nFor a helicopter, the measured control inputs will include\nthe main rotor collective, the longitudinal cyclic, the lateral\ncyclic and tail rotor collective that are collected in vector u as\nmentioned above. The measured outputs are a \u201cstandard\u201d set\nof variables that have physical significance, such as: airspeed,\nlinear accelerations, angular information (rates and attitudes)\netc (see e.g. [2]). They are either state variables or can be\napproximated as known linear combinations of the states and\ninputs, thus the measured output vector can be written as:\ny = Cx+Du+ v (2)\nwhere C is the measurement matrix, which is determined\nby the measured variables and sensor locations, and v is the\nmeasurement noise vector.\nTo identify model (1) using the aforementioned \u201cgrey-\nbox\u201d approach, it is assumed that the matrices A and B\nare parameterized by \u03b8 from physical understanding and\ninsight. The measurement model does not usually introduce\nnew unknown parameters to be estimated. To facilitate the\npresentation, the original physically relevant model (1) and\n(2) is rewritten as follows to show explicitly the dependency\non the parameter vector \u03b8:\nx\u02d9 = A(\u03b8)x+B(\u03b8)u+w (3)\ny = C(\u03b8)x+D(\u03b8)u+ v (4)\nFor most practical applications, the measurements are\nsampled-data (i.e. discrete), and the parameter estimation\nalgorithm will then be implemented in the discrete-time\ndomain. Suppose that the input is constant over the sampling\ninterval T , then the sampled\/discrete version of model (3)\nand (4) is given as follows (see e.g. [5] [3]):\nxk+1 = \u03a6(\u03b8)xk +G(\u03b8)uk +wk (5)\nyk = C(\u03b8)xk +D(\u03b8)uk + vk (6)\nwhere \u03a6(\u03b8) = eA(\u03b8)T and G(\u03b8) =\n\u222b T\n0 e\nA(\u03b8)\u03c4B(\u03b8)d\u03c4 ; wk,\nvk are white Gaussian sequences of appropriate strength and\nare independent of the input uk. Helicopter dynamic model\nidentification then amounts to the estimation of parameter\nvector \u03b8 which determines matrices \u03a6, G (thus A, B), C\nand D. This can be achieved using the iterative prediction\nerror method (PEM) (see e.g. [3]) or by state-augumentation-\nbased recursive nonlinear filtering techniques (see e.g [4],\n[6]). These will be briefly outlined next.\nA. Prediction error method (PEM) for state-space model\nidentification\nPEM is a conventional model identification technique that\nhas been well documented (see e.g. [3]). It consists of two el-\nements: a parameterization of the model to be identified, and\nthen the determination of the model parameters in such a way\nthat the measurements are \u201cexplained\u201d as accurately as pos-\nsible by the model. This is typically achieved by formulating\nthe estimation problem as an optimization problem, in which\nthe variables are the unknown parameters of the model, the\nconstraints are the model equations and the objective or\ncriterion function is a measure of the deviation between the\nobservations and the predictions obtained from the model\n(i.e. the prediction-error). To sum up, the parameter estimate\nis obtained by minimizing the prediction-error, so explaining\nthe name of the method.\nFollowing the above description, the parameter estimate\n\u03b8\u02c6N is defined by the following minimization (see e.g. [3]):\n\u03b8\u02c6N = \u03b8\u02c6N (Z\nN ) = argmin\n\u03b8\u2208\u0398\nVN (\u03b8,Z\nN) (7)\nHere the function VN (\u03b8,ZN) is, for a given data set ZN =\n{uk,yk, k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N}, a norm used for measuring the\n\u201csize\u201d of the prediction-error. It is defined as follows:\nVN (\u03b8,Z\nN) =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nk=1\nl(\u03b5(k,\u03b8)) (8)\nwhere l(\u00b7) is a well-defined scalar-valued positive function\nand \u03b5 is the prediction-error based on the model which\nis a function of the model parameter \u03b8. In our helicopter\napplication, the model to be identified is of MIMO state-\nspace form as shown in (5) and (6). The following norm\nor criterion function is used for measuring the \u201csize\u201d of the\nprediction-error:\nVN (\u03b8,Z\nN) = det\nN\u2211\nk=1\nek(\u03b8)e\nT\nk\n(\u03b8) (9)\nwhere the prediction-error vector ek(\u03b8) is defined as:\nek(\u03b8) = yk \u2212 y\u02c6k(\u03b8) (10)\nHere y\u02c6k(\u03b8) represents the prediction based on the model (5)\nand (6) parameterized by \u03b8 and yk is the actual measurement.\nFor a given data set ZN , the parameter estimate is then\ndefined by the following minimization of (9):\n\u03b8\u02c6N = argmin\n\u03b8\u2208\u0398\ndet\nN\u2211\nk=1\nek(\u03b8)e\nT\nk\n(\u03b8) (11)\nwhich is the maximum likelihood estimate for Gaussian\nnoise with unknown covariance matrix (see [3]). This way of\nestimating contains many well known and much used proce-\ndures. When the data set is given, the function VN defined\nby (9) is just an ordinary function of a finite-dimensional real\nparameter vector \u03b8. Determination of the parameter estimate\n\u03b8\u02c6N by (11) therefore amounts to a standard question of\nnonlinear optimization. In general, VN defined by (9) cannot\nbe minimized by analytical methods and a numerical solution\nwhich typically involves a nonlinear iterative search has to\nbe used.\nFor the parameter estimation problem defined by (11), it is\nthe global minimum that interests us. But the determination\nof such a global minimum can be difficult for general\nmodel parameterizations. The criterion, as a function of the\nparameter \u03b8 given by (9), can define a complicated surface\nwith many local minima, narrow valleys, and so on. This\nmay require substantial interaction from the user in providing\nreasonable initial parameter values to start the search so\nas to avoid being trapped into a local minimum. To find\nthe global solution, there is usually no other way than to\nstart the iterative minimization routine at different feasible\ninitial values and compare the results. For this reason, it is\nworthwhile to spend some effort on producing good initial\nvalues for the iterative search routine. An important option\nfor finding such an initial value is to use some preliminary\nestimation procedure. For a physically parameterized model\nstructure, as in the present application of helicopter dynamic\nmodelling, it is most natural to use physical insight to provide\nreasonable initial values.\nB. Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering (RBPF)-based\nmethod for state-space model identification\nIn contrast to the PEM method discussed above, the state-\naugumentation-based nonlinear filtering method described\nnext is a recursive (non-iterative) \u201cgrey-box\u201d modelling\nmethod. Again, the method requires explicit parameterization\nof matrices A and B from physical grounds as in (3).\nAs an alternative to PEM for dealing with the state-\nspace parameter estimation problem, the parameters to be\nestimated are viewed as additional states, or more precisely\nwe augment the state vector x with the parameter vector \u03b8 as\nz = [xT \u03b8T ]T and re-write the state-space model in terms\nof the augmented state vector z. We then have the following\nset of equations (see e.g. [4], [5]):\nzk+1=\n[\nxk+1\n\u03b8k+1\n]\n= g(zk) +\n[\nwk\nnk\n]\n=\n[\n\u03a6(\u03b8k)xk +G(\u03b8k)uk\n\u03b8k\n]\n+\n[\nwk\nnk\n]\n(12)\nyk = h(zk) + vk = C(\u03b8k)xk +D(\u03b8k)uk + vk (13)\nwhere nk is white Gaussian noise of appropriate strength\nintroduced for parameter evolution to allow the exploration\nof the parameter space. Obtaining the parameter estimation\nrecursively consequently becomes a general nonlinear filter-\ning problem. In principle, any available nonlinear filtering\nalgorithm can be used to solve this problem.\nTraditionally, the above nonlinear filtering problem of\nestimating the augmented state z so as to determine the\nparameter vector \u03b8 is attacked by the sampled-data extended\nKalman filter (EKF) (see e.g. [7], [5], [4]). As indicated in\n[8], \u201calthough this extended Kalman filter approach appears\nperfectly straightforward, experience has shown that, with the\nusual state-space model, it does not work well in practice\u201d.\nIn fact, there are no results to guarantee the convergence\nof the resulting EKF in the general case (see [7]). The\nresulting EKF, while being computationally cheap, is prone\nto divergence and also the parameter estimates obtained may\nbe sensitive to the choice of initial parameter values (see\ne.g. [6]). Our early research has also shown that the EKF-\nbased approach is inadequate for the problem of helicopter\nmodel identification considered in this paper. For this reason,\na newly developed Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF)\nbased parameter estimation method ([6], [9], see also [10],\n[11]) is adopted for solving the problem.\n1) Preliminaries: The particle filter (also known as the\nsequential Monte Carlo filter) (see e.g. [12], [13], [14], [15])\nis a simulation-based method for general nonlinear non-\nGaussian state estimation, which attempts to approximate\nthe complete probability density function (pdf) of the state\nto be estimated. This is in contrast to just estimating the\nfirst few central moments, as done for the EKF. The major\ninnovation of the particle filter is to approximate the required,\nusually complicated, pdf by a swarm of interacting points\ncalled \u201cparticles\u201d which can be considered as realizations or\nsamples from the required pdf, rather than by a function over\nthe state space. As such, the method is not subject to any\nlinearity and Gaussian constraints on the model. The particle\nfilter will propagate and update these particles as the mea-\nsurement becomes available and as the number of particles\nincreases, they effectively provide a good approximation to\nthe required pdf. See [16] and [17] for a summary of the\nstate-of-the-art of particle filtering algorithms.\nThe use of a particle filter for simultaneously estimating\nthe states and parameters in a general nonlinear non-Gaussian\nstate space model has been investigated by a number of\nauthors (see e.g. [18], [19]). The idea is similar to that\ndescribed above, that is to augment the state vector with\nunknown parameters, and then to design a particle filter based\non the augmented state-space model to perform estimation.\nA major drawback of such a direct use of a particle filter\nfor parameter estimation is that the large augmented state\ndimension might be prohibitive for practical use. Also no\neffort has been made in the above to exploit the analytically\ntractable substructure in the system. However, when parame-\nter estimation is restricted to linear and Gaussian models, an\nefficient algorithm can be derived using the so-called Rao-\nBlackwellization\/or marginalization technique (see e.g. [14],\n[16]) which will briefly be explained next.\n2) RBPF-based parameter estimation: To estimate \u03b8 in\n(5) and (6) using the RBPF-based method, the model (12)\nand (13) for nonlinear filtering is reformulated as follows:\n\u03b8k+1 \u223c p(\u03b8k+1|\u03b8k) (14)\nxk+1 = \u03a6(\u03b8k)xk +G(\u03b8k)uk +wk (15)\nyk = C(\u03b8k)xk +D(\u03b8k)uk + vk (16)\nwhere p(\u00b7|\u03b8k) denotes the pdf given \u03b8k.\nThe Bayesian approach to estimating the parameters in\nthe augmented system (14)\u223c(16) would be to construct\nthe posterior pdf p(zk|Zk) of the augmented state zk =\n[xT\nk\n\u03b8\nT\nk\n]T , and then determine the unknown parameters by\nestimating the augmented states zk with p(zk|Zk). This\nresults in a nonlinear filtering problem which can be solved\nby a standard particle filter (see e.g. [12], [13]) based on the\naugmented model (14)\u223c(16). In this case, one has to sample\nthe augmented state vector z and a standard particle filter\nwill recursively generate a sample-based approximation to\nthe augmented posterior pdf p(zk|Zk). The minimum mean\nsquared error (MMSE) estimate of zk is then calculated using\nthe augmented state samples zk|k\u22121(i), (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m)\nfrom the standard particle filter as follows:\nz\u02c6k = E[zk|Z\nk] =\n\u222b\nzkp(zk|Z\nk)dzk =\nm\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1k(i)zk|k\u22121(i)\n(17)\nwhere m is the number of particles (samples) used in the\nfilter and \u03b1k(i) is the probability weight associated with the\nith particle at time instant k.\nHowever, the MMSE of zk can be rewritten as:\nz\u02c6k =\n\u222b\nzkp(zk|Zk)dzk\n=\n\u222b\n[\n\u222b\n(xk,\u03b8k)p(xk|\u03b8k,Zk)dxk]p(\u03b8k|Zk)d\u03b8k\n(18)\nIn the present case, for each given parameter sample,\np(xk|\u03b8k,Zk) is Gaussian and the integral in the brackets\nin (18) can be computed analytically (i.e. the state vector\nxk can be marginalised out conditional upon a realisation\nof \u03b8k). This is because, for each realization (or sample) of\n\u03b8k, we have a single linear Gaussian state-space model as\nshown in (15) and (16). As such, the required marginalization\nor Rao-Blackwellization can be carried out exactly using\nthe Kalman filter algorithm. The resulting so called Rao-\nBlackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is similar to the standard\nparticle filter, but we only need to sample the parameter space\nrather than the augmented state space. Thus the size of the\nspace to be sampled is reduced. This will reduce the number\nof particles (and thus the computation) required or increase\nthe accuracy of the estimates for a given filter complexity.\nWith the RBPF, the pdf p(xk|\u03b8k,Zk) in (18) is given by the\nKalman filter, while p(\u03b8k|Zk) in (18) is approximated by\nthe particle filter. This will result in each parameter particle\nbeing associated with one Kalman filter recursion. It can\nbe thought of as using a particle filter for the nonlinear\nportion of the problem introduced by augmenting unknown\nparameters with the state vector, and the Kalman filter for the\nremainder. Thus the method makes full use of the analytically\ntractable substructure in the augmented system (14)\u223c(16).\nThe details of the algorithm can be found in [6].\n3) Practical implementation issues: In the application\nof the aforementioned RBPF-based parameter estimation\napproach, it is important to determine the conditional pdf\n(14), which depends on the method for parameter evolution.\nA straightforward way is to use a random walk model,\n\u03b8k+1 = \u03b8k + w\n\u03b8\nk\n, where w\u03b8\nk\nis zero mean Gaussian white\nnoise (see [18], also known as \u201croughening\u201d noise in [12]),\nfor parameter evolution to introduce artificial dynamics on\nthe parameters to be estimated. Here, the function of the\nrandom walk model is twofold: it allows the exploration\nof the parameter space on the one hand (otherwise, the\nparameter space would only be explored at the initialization\nof the algorithm as indicated in [20]) and reduces sample\ndegeneracy in particle filtering on the other. However, the\nuse of independent random shocks in a random walk model\nfor parameter evolution will result in posteriors being far\ntoo diffuse relative to the theoretical posteriors for the actual\nfixed parameters. As such the precision of the resulting\nestimates is inevitably limited and the estimates may not\nconverge.\nThe key to yielding converging parameter estimates is to\nmake the variance of the random walk decay with time. To\nachieve this, kernel smoothing with shrinkage as suggested\nby Liu & West in [19] is used for parameter evolution in\nthe present application. With this the evolution of parameter\nparticles is carried out as follows:\n\u03b8k+1 = a\u03b8k + (1 \u2212 a)\u03b8\u00afk +w\n\u03b8\nk\n(19)\nwhere a = (3\u03b4 \u2212 1)\/(2\u03b4), \u03b4 is a discount factor in (0, 1]\nwhich is chosen as \u03b4 = 0.99 in the present application; \u03b8\u00afk\nis the Monte Carlo mean of the parameters at time instant\nk and w\u03b8\nk\n\u223c N (0, h2Vk) is the \u201croughening\u201d noise with\nh2 = 1\u2212a2, Vk being the variance matrix of the parameters\nat time instant k. Following the above description, the pdf\nin (14) is of the following form:\np(\u03b8k+1|\u03b8k) = N (a\u03b8k + (1\u2212 a)\u03b8\u00afk, h\n2Vk) (20)\nIdeally, if the number of particles used for particle filtering\ntends to infinity, the variance of the \u201croughening\u201d noise in\nequation (19) for parameter evolution should decay with time\nand eventually become close to zero for estimation of the\nfixed parameters as shown in (20). However, the number of\nparticles used in RBPF will be limited in practice due to the\navailable computing power. For this reason, a lower bound\nto the variance of the \u201croughening\u201d noise will need to be set\nso as to enable the parameter particles to explore a small\nneighbourhood and avoid pre-maturation of the algorithm\ncaused by the limited number of the particles used. This\nlower bound may also enable the algorithm to track the slow\ndrifting in the parameters to be estimated as indicated in [6].\nIII. APPLICABILITY STUDIES VIA SIMULATIONS\nTo study the applicability and to illustrate the operation of\nthe methods described in the last section for helicopter dy-\nnamic modelling, the problem of identifying a helicopter ver-\ntical dynamic model with flapping (coning) dynamics is con-\nsidered in this section. The data is generated using a CH-47B\nresearch helicopter model taken from [21] where the model\nis parameterized by \u03b8 =\n[\n\u03b81 \u03b82 \u03b83 \u03b84 \u03b85 \u03b86 \u03b87 \u03b88\n]T\nas\nfollows:\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u03b2\u02d90\u03b2\u00a80\nw\u02d9\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 0 1 0\u03b81 \u03b82 \u03b83\n\u03b84 \u03b85 \u03b86\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nA(\u03b8)\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u03b20\u03b2\u02d90\nw\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb+\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 0\u03b87\n\u03b88\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nB(\u03b8)\n\u03b40 (21)\nwhere \u03b20 is rotor flapping angle, w\u02d9 is the vertical acceleration\nof the fuselage and \u03b40 is the collective input. The true (nom-\ninal) parameter values (denoted by \u03b8n) used for generating\ndata are given in the first row of Table I. The control input\n(\u03b40) is chosen as a PRBS signal. To facilitate comparsions,\nthe vertical acceleration w\u02d9 and flapping angle \u03b20 are assumed\nto be measurable, so the measurement equation is of the\nfollowing form:\ny =\n[\n\u03b20\nw\u02d9\n]\n=\n[\n1 0 0\n\u03b84 \u03b85 \u03b86\n]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nC(\u03b8)\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u03b20\u03b2\u02d90\nw\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb+\n[\n0\n\u03b88\n]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nD(\u03b8)\n\u03b40 + v (22)\nThe results of parameter estimation from PEM and RBPF-\nbased methods using different measurements with different\nassumptions of initial parameter values are summarized in\nTable I. Two sets of initial parameter values (denoted by\n\u03b80) have been used with PEM in the simulation studies, i.e.\n\u03b80 = 0.8 \u00d7 \u03b8n (which indicates good prior knowledge of\nthe parameters to be estimated) and \u03b80 = 0 (which implies\npoor or no prior knowledge of the parameters to be estimated\nand simply starts the PEM search from the point \u03b80 = 0).\nIt can be seen that, with \u03b80 = 0.8\u00d7 \u03b8n, quite good system\neigenvalue estimates \u03bbi(A\u02c6) can be obtained from PEM pa-\nrameter estimation as shown in the second and third rows of\nthe last column in Table I. The parameter estimates obtained\nwith measurements w\u02d9 and \u03b20 being available are also very\ngood, but the parameter estimates are degraded when only\nw\u02d9 is available (this is particularly so for the estimate of\n\u03b86 as shown in Table I), which implies that measurements\nof the rotor degrees of freedom may be required so as to\nobtain good parameter estimates for the extended model\nwith a particular physically-meaningful parametrization. The\nparameter estimates and the resulting system eigenvalues\nobtained from PEM with \u03b80 = 0 are not acceptable as\nTABLE I\nPARAMETER ESTIMATES AND THE RESULTING EIGENVALUES \u03bbi(A\u02c6) OBTAINED WITH DIFFERENT METHODS AND INITIAL PARAMETER VALUES\nnominal values \u03b8n\n\u2212607.421(\u03b81) \u221226.116(\u03b82) 0.387(\u03b83) 444.874(\u03b87)\n\u2212514.579(\u03b84) \u22123.924(\u03b85) 0.023(\u03b86) 83.510(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A)=\n\uf6be\n\u221212.893\u00b1 j20.837\n\u22120.308\nPEM with \u03b80 = 0.8\u00d7\u03b8n and measure-\nment w\u02d9 only\n\u2212589.459(\u03b81) \u221225.437(\u03b82) 0.477(\u03b83) 427.363(\u03b87)\n\u2212519.619(\u03b84) \u22124.756(\u03b85) 0.117(\u03b86) 85.548(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n\u221212.506\u00b1 j20.607\n\u22120.308\nPEM with \u03b80 = 0.8\u00d7\u03b8n and measure-\nments w\u02d9 and \u03b20\n\u2212594.697(\u03b81) \u221225.657(\u03b82) 0.379(\u03b83) 437.602(\u03b87)\n\u2212513.845(\u03b84) \u22124.567(\u03b85) 0.022(\u03b86) 85.865(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n\u221212.663\u00b1 j20.681\n\u22120.309\nPEM with \u03b80 = 0 and measurement w\u02d9\nonly\n\u22120.027(\u03b81) 0.258(\u03b82) 0.372(\u03b83) \u2212202.031(\u03b87)\n0.001(\u03b84) \u22120.008(\u03b85) \u22120.222(\u03b86) \u2212267.191(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n0.126\u00b1 j0.106\n\u22120.216\nPEM with \u03b80 = 0 and measurements\nw\u02d9 and \u03b20\n\u221213987(\u03b81) \u221241326(\u03b82) \u22127.0(\u03b83) 1655(\u03b87)\n\u2212688(\u03b84) \u22121732(\u03b85) 0.0(\u03b86) 87(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n\u22120.00\u00b1 j0.00\n\u221241326\nRBPF with uniformly distributed \u03b80 and\nmeasurement w\u02d9 only\n\u2212704.943(\u03b81) \u221232.566(\u03b82) 0.356(\u03b83) 669.015(\u03b87)\n\u2212420.925(\u03b84) \u22123.145(\u03b85) \u22120.070(\u03b86) 69.197(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n\u221216.176\u00b1 j20.916\n\u22120.285\nRBPF with uniformly distributed \u03b80 and\nmeasurements w\u02d9 and \u03b20\n\u2212654.943(\u03b81) \u221228.135(\u03b82) 0.400(\u03b83) 489.785(\u03b87)\n\u2212528.105(\u03b84) \u22124.184(\u03b85) 0.010(\u03b86) 79.735(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n\u221213.904\u00b1 j21.312\n\u22120.316\nRBPF+PEM with uniformly distributed\n\u03b80 and measurement w\u02d9 only\n\u2212582.289(\u03b81) \u221225.075(\u03b82) 0.075(\u03b83) 448.575(\u03b87)\n\u2212493.680(\u03b84) \u22124.462(\u03b85) \u22120.245(\u03b86) 85.549(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n\u221212.505\u00b1 j20.607\n\u22120.309\nRBPF+PEM with uniformly distributed\n\u03b80 and measurements w\u02d9 and \u03b20\n\u2212594.874(\u03b81) \u221225.638(\u03b82) 0.378(\u03b83) 437.378(\u03b87)\n\u2212514.184(\u03b84) \u22124.551(\u03b85) 0.022(\u03b86) 85.813(\u03b88)\n\u03bbi(A\u02c6)=\n\uf6be\n\u221212.654\u00b1 j20.691\n\u22120.308\nshown in the fourth and fifth rows of Table I, which indicates\nthat the PEM method is sensitive to the choice of initial\nparameter values. The parameter estimates and the resulting\nsystem eigenvalues obtained from RBPF-based method with\nthe number of parameter particles used in the RBPF being\nchosen as m = 40000 are shown in the sixth and seventh\nrows of Table I. The results, though not as good as those\nobtained from PEM with \u03b80 = 0.8 \u00d7 \u03b8n as shown in the\nsecond and third rows of Table I, are acceptable. It needs\nto be pointed out that these results are obtained with the\nassumption of very poor knowledge on the initial parameter\nvalues. More precisely, the results are obtained with the\nparameter particles initialized with uniform distributions over\nthe whole possible range of parameter values. As such, the\nRBPF-based method is much more robust than the PEM\nmethod with respect to the choice of the initial parameter\nvalues. This motivates the estimation scheme that combines\nthese two methods, i.e. the RBPF-based method is used as\na preliminary estimation procedure to produce the initial\nparameter estimates and PEM is then used to refine the\nparameter estimates from this initial point. The results of\nparameter estimation obtained from a combination of these\ntwo methods are shown in the last two rows of Table I. Again\nthe parameter estimates are improved when measurement of\nthe rotor degree of freedom (\u03b20) is used as can be seen in\nthe ninth row when compared with the results in the eighth\nrow of Table I.\nIV.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe problem of estimating parameters in a state-space\nhelicopter dynamic model using time-domain estimation\ntechniques has been studied. Two methods have been pre-\nsented for solving the problem. Simulation studies have been\ncarried out to assess the performance of the two methods and\nthe main results can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The PEM method can produce good parameter estimates\nwith modest computational demand but needs good\ninitial parameter values to start the search.\n\u2022 The RBPF-based method can produce reasonable pa-\nrameter estimates with little prior knowledge of the ini-\ntial parameter values but is computationally expensive.\n\u2022 A combination of both methods is believed to be an\nappropriate solution to the problem considered in this\npaper. That is, the RBPF-based method is used for\nproducing an initial parameter estimate and PEM search\nis then started from this initial point to refine the\nparameter estimate.\nThe methods presented in this paper require prior knowl-\nedge of the particular structure of the model and good\ninitial values \/or possible ranges of the parameters to be\nestimated. If such prior knowledge is not available, \u201cblack-\nbox\u201d system identification techniques (e.g. the subspace-\nbased method) need to be used; see [22] for a recent\nstudy. Though reasonable system eigenvalue estimates can be\ncalculated from the results of parameter estimation without\nusing measurements from rotor degrees of freedom, the\nsimulation studies show that such measurements are required\nto improve the parameter estimates for the extended state-\nspace helicopter dynamic model with a particular physically-\nrelevant structure.\nThe combined estimation scheme proposed in this paper\nwas also applied to real flight test data from WHL and a ver-\ntical model including rotor coning dynamics was identified\nfor an EH101 helicopter. Further work is being carried out\nto validate the identified model.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank Westland Helicopters Ltd\n(WHL) for provision of the flight test data.
