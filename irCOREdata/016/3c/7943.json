Foods and products having primary ingre-\ndients consisting of native and chemically modified food\nproteins, polysaccharides, and lipids are widespread (6) and can\ninclude simple natural foods themselves, \u201csynthetic foods\u201d, and\npharmaceutical dispersions (3, 9). The interplay of ingredients\nand its effect on the macroscopic behavior of food and\ntherapeutic products remains an area of significant interest\nbecause of quality and economic considerations. Shelf life and\ncompositional variations are of interest to food manufacturers\nand processors alike (19, 28). Investigation of the inclusion of\nantioxidants and interfacial effects on lipid autoxidation in food\nbased on oils (12) is deemed important to the modeling and\nprediction of product shelf life. The role of new \u201cpurpose-built\nbiosurfactants\u201d, food nutrient status, textural properties, and\nbreakdown compounds such as Maillard reaction products\nbecomes an important feature of mass-produced goods that are\nbased on coarse or nanodispersions. These can include cereals\n(dough, cakes, confectionary, etc.), milk protein-based disper-\nsions and gels, edible oils, products for parenteral nutrition or\ntherapy, and nutraceutical-cosmeceutical oils and lotions (8).\nThe notion of competitive adsorption of surfactants and\nproteins has been studied over a period of time and is illustrated\nto good effect in surface dilation and foam film experiments\n(21). Additionally, competitive displacement and adsorption\nbetween a synthetic polymer and lauryl sulfate (SDS) soap have\nalso been studied for the purposes of evaluation of binding\ncapabilities (18), and serum albumin-lipid interactions have\nbeen studied for use in microencapsulation (that might be\nextended to food volatiles and flavor) applications (8).\nWhen applied to investigations concerning dispersed product\nstability, this has been related to the formation of a water cushion\ncovering the polymer or protein and the molecular freedom of\nthe chains on the surface of a colloidal particle that can permit\nprotein attachment (e.g., serum complement system proteins)\ninthecaseofpolymer-coateddrugparticles,suchasliposomes(9,26).\nThis response has been observed for ethylene oxide and\npropylene oxide block copolymers such as pluronics, poly(eth-\nyleneglycol), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide).

With particulate dispersions, protein or polymer dehydra-\ntion and removal of this water \u201ccushion\u201d lead to aggregation\nof the particles (3) and subsequent flocculation, and with foams\nand emulsions this can increase the extent of \u201cnatural\u201d creaming\nand coalescence (23\u201325). The movement of small molecules,\nsuch as emulsifiers, within the gelled adsorbed layer, considered\nas aggregates or a network with micro- and nanoscale defects\n(10), can relate to the behavior of complex systems and is\nthought to affect gross textural properties.\nThe interface, in addition to being interesting in its own right,\nrepresents an ideal planar (more simplified) model environment\nfor examination of molecular complexing and cross-linking\nprocesses and how they influence food quality in addition to\nchemical instability and incompatibility. The aim of our work\nhas been to produce a simplified surface rheometer to screen\ninteractions that might occur between surface-active biological\nand synthetic food polymer molecules in an attempt to supple-\nment sometimes inconclusive spectrophotometric and light-\nscattering methods and complex bulk rheology. Adsorbed\nprotein is often modeled as a continuous gel network, and the\nexchange of covalent bonds such as disulfide bonds or ester\nlinkages becomes important. Under appropriate conditions this\ncan be modeled by surface rheology so that elements of\nchemistry, not simply mechanical properties, can be identified\n(27).\nOver the past decade a number of impressive techniques, in\nterms of the labor investment and study required for their setup,\nhave been used to examine interfacial mechanics. Most of the\ntechniques have the limitations of extensive calibration and\ninvestigation for their routine use and the production of complex\nand customarily unclear data. Among these techniques there\nare some techniques that have contributed significantly to\ngeneral understanding.\nAriola et al. (2) used interfacial rheology for shear (tearing) and\ndilation (stretching; dilatation) of the interface using a Langmuir\ntrough, and this was considered to provide more of physical but\nnot biochemical description; however, this could depend more on\nthe experimental setup. We might look to undertake such experi-\nments in any enzyme-based future work. Techniques such as\nsurface dilation (21, 22) and surface shear rheology have been used\nfor monitoring protein\u2013protein interactions and Maillard condensa-\ntion products such as lipid\u2013protein and polysaccharide-protein\nconjugates (28). Rheology using a Du No\u00fcy ring and Langmuir\ntrough with mathematical fitting has been used for comparable\noutput to our method providing \u201cactual\u201d values. The precise\nmagnitude of these values and their interpretation remain a matter\nof some speculation, and this was obtained after extensive work.\nThe protein and melanoidin-polysaccharide fraction of coffee was\nassessed by measurement of interfacial elasticity using oscillatory\nshear with a Du No\u00fcy ring, and this was related to a kinetic model\nof network formation (19).\nOur approach is to use the simplest description that might\nhelp us resolve small but significant changes in surface\ncomposition and could involve pendant polymer chains that dip\ninto the bulk aqueous phase and are associated with a cushion\nof protective water. In some cases, this might be resolved (in\nfull or in part) by nanorheological means (1, 6) such as atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM), but this is a technique that is difficult\nto use and is often seen as an expensive and largely inaccessible\ntechnique for routine applications. Food apoproteins and lipid\nisolated from egg yolk that play a vital role in the use of egg\nand its functionality in food were investigated in this manner\n(6). Both AFM and Langmuir trough works were used to\nobserve structure and relate this to interfacial rheology. Two\ntypes of general behavior were observed: aggregates of inter-\nfacial material (measured as a viscous system) and extensive\nnetwork formation that may relate to nanoscale aggregations\nof material but that clearly exist as a network (measured as a\nviscoelastic system).\nIn another approach surface rheology was estimated by a\ncapillary wave method that indicated the major difference\nbetween surfactant-based (fluid-like) and polymer- or protein-\nbased (highly viscous or rigid-like) interfacial adsorbed layers\n(17). In both cases the insoluble Gibbs or Langmuir monolayers\nwere dependent on moiety spreading, diffusion to the interface\n(controlled by bulk concentration), to form a \u201ctough\u201d interfacial\nfilm. The properties of casein films were estimated using the\nadditional experimental methods of ellipsometry and X-ray\nscattering, and this was used to build a picture of interfacial\ncomposition (4). Rheological studies here were based on a float\nbut made use of reflected light and a magnet to drive the\noscillations that indicate surface properties and provided a \u201cshear\nelastic constant\u201d, aimed to unravel the determinants of network\nformation and link this to coarse dispersion stability. In this\ncase evidence of protein multilayers was seen with \u0001-casein at\nthe air\u2013water interface. Surface rheology has also been assessed\nusing an oscillating bubble method (16), but that took 17 h of\nequilibration and a pendant drop approach (7). These two\ntechniques represent \u201creal food foams and emulsions\u201d in some\nsense in that they deal with small curved interfaces. Across many\nconsiderations, such as ease of use and simplicity of function,\nthey might be seen as less suitable approaches than our\nequipment for the mass screening of samples but did yield results\nof high quality. The techniques were used to provide information\non the mechanisms of interfacial mechanics, interfacial competi-\ntion, structuring, synergism, complexation, and binding, and\nextrapolation to real systems is not always relevant to model\nsystems.\nWe aim to provide data to support the routine use of a\nsimplified apparatus that performs the same generalized func-\ntions as some of the more theoretically oriented methods\ndescribed above but that can be applied to solutions (and\nultimately oil\u2013water interfaces) to provide a more usable form\nof information but that builds on work already undertaken to\nallow a fuller understanding of interfacial amphiphile behavior\nand its ultimate role in determining the quality of foods.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSolutions were prepared using biological and synthetic pharmaceuti-\ncal polymers and surfactants (low molecular weight detergents and\nemulsifiers).

All glassware was cleaned routinely with sulfochromic acid.\nHowever, materials that might have been corroded by such cleaning,\nfor example, the conductance electrode and the measuring head device,\nwere cleaned by soft abrasion using a dilute Tween 20 solution,\nfollowed by copious rinsing with pure water.\nA very limited number of surface rheology experiments involving\nBSA were undertaken at pH 5.6 in 50 mM citric acid-phosphate buffer\nto mimic the conditions used for calibration with accrued experimental\ndata (refer to Table 2). The materials used in the Max-Planck data\nwere BLG (type L0130, lot 91H7005) and BSA (type A7030, lot\n11H0107), supplied by the Sigma Chemical Co., and T20 (Surfact-\nAmps preparation 10%, type 2830), supplied by Pierce (Rockford,\nIL).\nFoam Stability and Bubble Composition (C300). The technique\ninvolving measurement of conductivity was used to probe variations\nin interfacial composition and to estimate appropriate ratios in binary\nsolution mixtures of polymer and low molecular weight surfactants.\nThe experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 1. The configuration is\ndifferent from previous work, but the principle of operation is well-\nknown and well understood (20\u201322). Foam stability is defined as the\nresidual conductivity (C300) of an intact foam remaining after 300 s of\ndrainage and the sampled stable thin liquid films (TLFs) (5). Previous\nwork has demonstrated that this approach can be used to map interfacial\neffects (20, 21) and their extrapolation to the bulk stability (liquid\nretention) in foams. Because the ionic strength of the buffered solvent\nis high (50 mM), the technique measures the \u201cvolume of entrained\nliquid\u201d between two electrode wires spaced 5 mm apart but positioned\nwithin the body of the foam. Foam drainage shows a typical decay\ncurve (Figure 1., panel A). The terminal value after 5 min from the\nfoam column reaching a particular height (23) provides an indication\nof the residual water held within the foam and can be used to compare\nsamples of pure proteins or mixtures of surface-active agents at a fixed\nmolar ratio (R).\nSurface Tension. Samples of 20 mL portions of the liquid tested\nwere allowed to thermally equilibrate for a period of 10 min. A\nroughened glass microscope slide used for the Wilhelmy plate (2 \u00d7 2\n\u00d7 0.02 cm) method was used to determine the interfacial composition\nand surface tension (mN\/m) using a torsion balance and the appropriate\nweight of detachment from the air\u2013water interface. Pure water was\nfound to have a value of 72.8 mN\/m at 20 \u00b0C (21, 22).\nInterfacial Shear Rheology. The basis of the experimental technique\nis the damped oscillation of a pendulum after an initial fixed deformation\n(Figure 2a, lever position A to B). The number of swinging pendulum\noscillations is related to the viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed\nsurface layer (24) (when other contributions are neglected) situated in\nthe plane of the interface. Ultimately, the pendulum stops to oscillate,\nand this is directly related to a surface damping effect on the measuring\nhead over and above that of the bulk aqueous phase or surrounding\nair. In its simplest format the apparatus consists of a steel torsion wire,\na measuring head (bob), a trigger switch, and the sample solution\n(Figure 2a, panel A). The dimensions of the apparatus and spatial\nalignment are fixed so that there is equal treatment between samples.\nInitial calibration of the pendulum was undertaken in air and water,\nwater providing 292% damping of the number of oscillations in air.\nAll sample measurements were blanked against the damping found for\na fresh interface formed on a pure sample of water (surface tension )\n72.8 mN\/m at 20 \u00b0C). In our experimental configuration the 69.2 g\nmagnesium-aluminum alloy, 61.8 mm diameter measuring head (and\nfixings), and 69.5 mm long copper trigger (Figure 2a) dimensions and\nthe bob interfacial immersion are fixed and safeguarded against air\nmovement or other interferences by housing in a protective sheath. The\ntrigger is responsible for completing an electrical circuit (Figure 2b)\nindicated by both a red diode output and recorder square-wave signal\n(Figure 2b, panel B). The number of contacts and hence square-wave\nsignal peaks can be counted (or the entire span measured and thus\nequated to a number) and related to a surface damping when related to\nthose seen with water. The point when the trigger fails to make contact\nwith the trigger plate, even though the measuring head may still be\noscillating, corresponds to the end of the experimental data acquisition\nfor every sample solution.\nThe standard concentration used was 1.0 \u00b5M in studies involving\nproteins; other concentrations tested are indicated at the appropriate\npoint. Measurements are made by placing 35.0 mL of test solution into\na cleaned 9.6 cm diameter, 1.0 cm deep glass dish. The sample was\nleft to surface and thermally equilibrate for at least 2 min, but as a\nmatter of routine and standard practice, for 20 min. Measurements\nfollow an initial 15\u00b0 deformation of the position of the bob sitting on\nthe surface of the test sample. Measurements were usually related to\ntriplicate repeat runs all undertaken on the same sample. For the\npurposes of relating damping to estimates of surface viscosity (15),\npreviously unpublished data and sample mixtures used for testing of a\nnew apparatus were used in this study. The vertical location of the\nmeasuring head is such that there is no effective immersion into the\nbulk phase, but the contact angle of the meniscus of the solvent with\nthe sidewall of the bob is very small and close to 0\u00b0. The vertical \u201cz\u201d\nand lateral \u201cx-y\u201d positioning of both the sample dish and the trigger\ncontact post (made from brushed copper tubing) were achieved using\na mechanical lift.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe properties of macroscopic interfaces are thought to\nrepresent effective models of the interfacial adsorbed layer of\nfoams and emulsions. Figure 3 (panel A) shows the difference\nin initial foam drainage form and rates between foams that are\nstabilized by proteins and surfactant, respectively. Interfacial\nadsorption and rheology using a pendant drop model (7) have\nbeen used to investigate protein\u2013protein interactions that are\nrelevant to food and dispersion form. It is reportedly the \u201cdepth\u201d\nof these interactions that promotes bubble stability (7, 22). With\nprotein-stabilized foams the thin liquid films (TLFs) separating\nthe bubbles are thicker, and consequently entrained liquid and\nthus microconductivity values (\u00b5S) at the same moment in time\nare higher than with simple surfactant such as SDS. Even after\n5 min of drainage, there is more water within a BSA-stabilized\nfoam as compared to an SDS-stabilized foam, despite the bubble\nsize being approximately the same (2 mm diameter). This is\nthought to be related to the pendant chains of polymer\/protein\nthatprotrudeawayfromthebubblesurface (3,9,13,19,21,22,26).\nFoams and their foam lamellae are used to assess the\nconcentrations that relate to fragmentation of the interface on\nTLFs (5, 13) and foam bubbles (21). At very low molar ratios\nthe adsorbed layer immobilized at the interface is thought to\neffectively fragment, and this has formed the bases of consider-\nable previous study. The mechanism behind the dissolution of\nprotein\u2013protein interaction as in protein-stabilized foams is\nthought to be the competitive adsorption of surfactant (6, 20, 21).\nTable 1.

Interfaces that\ncontain less polymer stabilizer tend to give thinner TLFs. As\nthe dissolution of interfacial cross-links between adjacent protein\n(polymer) molecules is increased within the foam, it becomes\nmore unstable and susceptible to bubble coalescence. This has\nbeen studied in detail for food foams and a number of simple\nmodel systems (20). The molar ratio (R) at which significant\ndissolution appears is usually considerably less than 1.0. In\nprevious work this has been found to occur at R ) 0.1 in\ndilatational rheology (21), R ) 0.25 (22), and R ) 0.33 (25),\nall of which depend on the protein species and its inclination\nto stay at the interface and the type of surfactant present. In the\nprotein-surfactant mixtures tested with interfacial rheology here,\nvalues of R < 0.1 were used, and these correspond to the initial\ndissolution of intermolecular cross-links. At very high molar\nratios the interface resembles a composition that is similar to\nthat formed from a pure surfactant solution (Figure 3, panel\nB).\nSmall molecular weight surfactants tend to dominate at the\ninterface when in competition with proteins and polymers. Table\n1 shows the surface tensions of dilute solutions and those at\nplateau equilibrium concentration (minimum in surface tension).\nProteins (BSA, BLG, casein mixtures) generally give surface\ntensions in the region of 50 mN\/m; effective polymeric\nemulsifiers were found to give equilibrium surface tensions of\n40 mN\/m, but smaller surfactants are able to significantly reduce\nthe air\u2013water surface tension to <30 mN\/m. Given a mixture\nof BLG and Tween 20, the surfactant or a complex of protein\nand surfactant (22) has been shown to predominate over the\nnative protein molecule. Previous work has shown that polymers\ncan displace protein from the interface (24), and some studies\n(16) report on cellulose derivatives having surface tensions of\nabout 45 mN\/m. This could be of significance when food gums\nand proteins are combined in processed foods and a likely\nsubject of future work.\nA series of solutions of surface-active molecules were tested\nfor their ability to damp the movements of a probing surface\nshear device. The results are presented in Figure 4; here the\neffect of equilibration time was demonstrated clearly. In previous\ntheoretical work equilibration times of 12 and 17 h have been\nconsidered before equilibrium conditions were achieved. These\ntechniques generally used very large volumes and very dilute\nsolutions (16, 27). One of our primary aims has been to reduce\nthe length of time taken before measurement, and for this reason\nwe do not look to directly measure surface viscosity.\nRheology in various forms can thus be used to test covalent\nlinkages. At present a scientific fixation with absolute measure-\nments (viscoelasticity models; G*, G\u2032, and G\u2032\u2032) means the\ntechniques are overly complicated and not used for effective\nrapid screening of possible formulation candidates as we suggest\n(27). In the methodologies mentioned by these authors and\nothers, equilibration of the sample took more than half a day\nfor pseudo-equilibrium conditions to be obtained and used up\nto a quarter of a liter, almost 8 times the volume we use. Because\nthe behavior is very typically \u201cnonlinear\u201d, the surface shear\nviscosity (stress\/strain; \u03b7s) and its development depend on many\nvariables associated with the experimental data acquisition and\nthe way it is physically sampled; this can ultimately provide\ndifficulties in cross-comparing samples. This is made even more\ncomplex when extracted values such as G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 are extracted\nfrom derived mechanical spectra (19).\nTable 2.

With BSA alone and BLG\nprotein in the presence of Tween 20 (R ) 1000), the percentage\ndamping increased with equilibration time. This in principle\ncorresponds to a stiffening or thickening in consistency of the\nadsorbed layer, but may also reflect a transition from \u201celastic\u201d\nto more \u201cviscous\u201d surface-aggregated (2, 7, 27) adsorbed\ninterfacial material. This was observed in previous studies using\nbifunctional agents (22, 25) and seen on the aging of the\ninterface that relates to molecular \u201cjuggling\u201d and position\noptimization at the interface (14).\nHowever, with casein and BLG protein in the presence of\nTween 20 (R ) 0.09) the surface damping decreased with\nequilibration time. In the case of the latter this may be due to\nsignificant rearrangement and dissolution of protein\u2013protein\ninteractions. Recent investigations show that aging (14), with\nrespect to development of significant viscoelasticity, occurs at\nthe interface with proteins. This is explained in terms of the\nmoiety hydrophobicity and the extent of flexibility in the\nmolecule that permit the ease of reconformation at the interface,\nalongside its neighboring molecules that leads to an increase in\nsurface rigidity. This is particularly thought to be the case with\nmany foods for which the textural \u201celastic form\u201d of material\nsurrounding gas bubbles or fat crystals is an important indicator\nof quality, such as bread dough and in cakes and pastries.\nWith casein samples, although the percentage of surface\ndamping decreases between 2 and 90 min, the effect was\nmarginal, and it is difficult to say whether this is a real effect\nor simply due to experimental variation. Our sample was a\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of the experimental setup of an air-water surface rheometer.

Given that the equipment\u2019s\nprincipal purpose is to compare samples, most measurements\nwere taken after 20 min of thermal equilibration.\nThe percentage damping that is synonymous with surface\nconsistency increases (D) appears as four forms in Figure 5.\nWater and low molecular weight surfactants appear to give\nvalues between 0 and \u223c2%, respectively. Interfaces stabilized\nby protein and a mixture of protein with some incorporated\nsurfactant give much higher values between 12 and 23%, and\nsurface-active polymers (such as poloxamers) give values\nbetween 7 and 9%. \u0001-Lactoglobulin that has been studied\nextensively in terms of dilatational rheology and development\nof significant surface \u201celasticity\u201d (21, 22, 25), and constant shear\nviscometry at the oil\u2013water interface (23) gives a surface\ndamping value of 12.5% and is indicated by the broken line in\nthe figure. Depending on the technique used, this protein is\nthought to give highly viscoelastic adsorbed layers (21). These\nare often considered to be in the form of multilayers that are\nbased on a cohesive single primary adsorbed layer of protein\nmolecules (2, 27).\nThe interplay of food ingredients in a real system such as\ncoffee foam was used to investigate protein-carbohydrate\ncomplexes (19). Interfacial effects were considered to be due\nto the interaction between the lysine amino groups of the protein\nfraction and carbohydrate ester groups. Other nonspecific\nmolecular interactions in the interfacial layer were thought to\nbe related principally to electrostatic and hydrophobic interac-\ntions. The group noted the findings of interfacial measurements,\nand these correlated well with foam stability as in our case.\nWhen the interface is considered to have a significantly high\ndamping value, this correlated well with the C300 values (Figure\n3) that are higher for BSA than for simple surfactants, such as\nSDS, that demonstrate weak damping (Figure 5), and this is\nassociated with water retention in the TLF subphase in the foam\nassociatedwiththeinterfacialpresenceofhydrophilicpolymer(3,26)\nas found with colloidal particles.\nTwo of the proteins examined are distinguished from what\nmight be considered to be conventional model globular proteins\nFigure 3.

In the case of human serum albumin (HSA) this\ndamping is increased by approximately 150% from that\nmeasured for BLG, and in the case of jack bean urease (UJB)\nthis value is 180% higher. Both HSA and BSA have the same\nmolecular weight, which is approximately 3.5 times that of BLG,\nand so it can only be assumed to be related to the extent of\ninterfacial cross-linking that depends on the small-scale mo-\nlecular differences between BSA and HSA, possibly in the\nlocation and number of hydrophobic, charged amino acids, or\ndisulfide bond content (11). In the case of UJB the protein has\na molecular weight >29 times that of BLG, and this may explain\nthe scope for greater interfacial cross-linking (2, 14) and\nentanglement and the subsequent increase in the rigidity and\ndamping of the interfacial layer.\nThe pluronic samples measured have marginally different\nmolecular weights but seem to contradict this molecular weight\nrelated \u201cviscosity\u201d increase. Here, the 14.6 kDa F108 has a lower\ninterfacial viscoelasticity than the F68 species, which is 42%\nsmaller and yet present at the same molar concentration. This\ncould be related to the time of pseudoequilibrium rearrangement,\nlocal interfacial conditions (26), diffusion to the interface, and\ncoverage of the surface (3, 9, 1018). The smaller species should\ndiffuse more rapidly and may take less time to unfold or reorient\nat the interface. In either case, it is noteworthy that the D values\nfor these pluronics (poloxamers) are 40% less than seen with\nBLG (but \u223c500% more than with Tween 20). This is obviously\nrelated to the diversity of potential cross-links with the BLG\noverly simple block copolymers such as poloxamers and, thus,\nmargin for development of greater interfacial \u201cviscoelasticity.\u201d\nThe damping (viscosity, as measured here) is a function of\nthe inertia of the bob suspended as a pendulum and its\ninteraction with both the circuit trigger (via a hair-like spring)\nand primarily the interfacial adsorbed layer, elasticity in the wire,\nand a damping provided by both the resistance of the air and\nviscous drag from the water or other primary solvent used on\nwhich the bob rests. The best and most convenient description\nis explained below as a simplified function with multiple\ncontributions; each of the contributions can have a range of\ndomain values.\nsurface damping parameter (d) ) f(I, E, s, P, W, a)\n(1)\nElemental contributions are indicated as I, inertia following the\n15\u00b0 initial swing of the pendulum bob; E, elasticity of the 200\n\u00b5m diameter, 191 mm long steel wire; s, elasticity and spring-\nlike damping from the 80 \u00b5m diameter copper wire trigger; P,\ndamping resulting from the surface molecular layer; W, damping\nresulting from the interfacial subphase; and a, damping resulting\nfrom the air surrounding the pendulum bob. Major contributions\nare presented in capital letters, but in our highly standardized\nmodel equipment only the damping of the interfacial layer is\nallowed to vary between experimental runs.\nThe 69.5 mm copper trigger hair has a 13 ( 3% contribution\nto the normal damping of the pendulum in air (150 ( 2 full\nswings),; this can be seen as a 5% decrease in the number of\nswings in a minute when the contact with the trigger contact\n(Figure 2a) is removed. In any case this is a point of limited\nfurther detailed discussion because the equipment was always\nrun with the contact possible for all of our measurements. The\ncontact is needed after all to complete the circuit. What dictates\nthe contact made is the number and extent of swings in the\noscillations of the measuring head (bob). These oscillations are\ndirectly influenced by interaction between the device measuring\nhead and molecules located in the plane of the interface. In this\nmanner the technique is superior in many ways to optical-based\ntechniques such as pendant drop or bubble form methods in\nthat a direct physical sampling of the interface takes place and,\nsecond, in that the shear rate of the bob is reduced (and thus\nsensitivity is increased) by this interaction on each marginally\nless pronounced successive pendulum swing.\nThe real \u201capparent\u201d surface viscosity can be estimated with\nthe use of calibration studies. The value of this lies in simply\nbeing able to describe events occurring at the surface in another\nway. These calibration data and experiments were previously\nperformed during collaborative investigations (15). Using a\nsimple fitting program, these can be approximated to our\nfindings with a four-point calibration (see Table 2) to give\npredicted viscosities (\u00b5Ns\/m) and are described in a minimized\nform in the following highly simplified relationship (R2 ) 0.949,\nn ) 4):\napparent \u2033predicted\u2033 surface viscosity (\u03b7p) )\n[k1(lnD)] - k2 (2)\nk1 is a constant of 1719, D is the percentage damping of the\nsample, as the surface damping parameter (d) compared to that\nseen with a clean interface from pure water, and k2 is a constant\nof 713.\nThe constants in this case are dimensionless values and simply\nscale the viscosity against the percentage damping. The first\npoint worth noting is the good fit between extrapolated surface\nviscosity and damping described above. The apparent viscosities\nare based on an extrapolated value after 10 min (\u03b7e) with a\ncorrelation coefficient close to 1.0 for each of the values shown\nin Table 2 and incorporated into the testing regime, based on\nreal experimental data acquired up to 6 min (15). In our case\nfuller equilibration time is always taken as 20 min (at least 10\nmin), even though preliminary experiments (Figure 3; Table\n2) indicate that the equilibration time, particularly for polymer-\nstabilized interfaces, takes longer than the 2\u20136 min to reach\nplateau pseudo-equilibrium values. The more \u201cretarding\u201d the\ninteraction between the metal bob (measuring head) and the\nsurface the higher is the percentage damping. As can be seen\nfrom Figure 4 the damping for a solution of 0.02 mg\/mL (1\n\u00b5M) BLG is about 12.5% (Table 2, about 10 times greater than\nthat seen with a submolar surfactant solution interface (Figure\n5).\nIn our system we are unable at present to disaggregate the\n\u201celastic and viscous\u201d components of the measured damping\nparameter. However, this might be undertaken as part of future\nstudies, but we do not consider this to be as important as the\nability to compare samples for future envisaged evaluation. What\nis clear from our data is that the elasticity is customarily lower\nwhen the viscosity is higher (compare values in parentheses in\nTable 2, for protein mixtures); very low elasticities are to some\nextent \u201cinventions\u201d, possibly created by inappropriately \u201ctimed\u201d\nevaluation of Gibbs-type surfactant monolayers or mathematical\ndissection of raw data. Similarly, the technique described here\nmeasures percentage damping, and although it is clear that there\nis some effect for simple surfactants, the values are surprisingly\nhigh when compared to known \u201cviscoelastic\u201d protein-based\ninterfaces such as that formed from BLG or BSA solutions\n(\u223c14% of the value for BLG alone). This is repeatedly observed\nfor the measured damping for Tween 20 and SDS interfaces,\nwhich are essentially \u201cfluid-like\u201d but provide a definite positive\nD value (Figure 4) when compared to a fresh interface formed\non water. It may also suggest that our technique is able to \u201csee\u201d\nvery low surface viscosities. The other real value of the novel\nEvaluation of Protein and Polymer Function J. Agric.

Previous\nstudies have indicated that foam and emulsion thin liquid film\nform, based on surface adsorbed material is responsible for\nconferring stability properties on coarse dispersions (19, 2122).\nUsing the estimation it seems that there is a considerably good\nfitting between the predicted surface viscosity (eq 2, \u03b7p) and\nthe projection of experimentally monitored viscosities. This can\nbe demonstrated by reference to the ratios presented in Figure\n6. Here, a ratio of 1.0 indicates that the predicted \u201csurface\nviscosity\u201d is identical to that of the model data (extrapolated\n10 min data) on the basis of results from experiments undertaken\nat the MPI.\nWith \u0001-lactoglobulin-stabilized systems the effect of time on\nspreading of the protein at the interface is of significant interest\nand extensive contemporary debate. In \u201cpure\u201d protein systems\n(solutions) this time-related surface equilibrium is considered\nto be extensive; however, for mixtures (particularly lipids or\nsurfactants) this equilibrium is generally much shorter, and this\ncan be a consequence of rapid bulk-surface diffusion and the\neffective competitive adsorption of low molecular weight\namphiphiles over polymers. From a range of observations and\nancillary measurements (not reported), it appears that globular\nparticles adsorb and then reconfigure slowly over a period of\nmany minutes to hours to form a spreading microheterogeneous\nmass. This observation is supported by a considerable body of\nscientific data, including neutron reflectance and atomic force\nmicroscopy measurements (6) and many other experimental\ndelineatory approaches. The form of this cross-linked mass is\nat present not entirely clear, although current thinking points\nto an aggregate-cross-linked monolayer. There is an equilibrium\nestablished between this spreading and the arrival of \u201cnew\u201d and\nthe departure of \u201cold\u201d molecules with respect to the interface.\nAdditionally, the way lactoglobulin interacts at the oil\/water\n(O\/W) or air\/water (A\/W) interface is likely to differ signifi-\ncantly from that of nonglobular proteins, such as caseins, or\nthat of the very bulky and rigid globular proteins, such as BSA.\nThe basis of these differences may be related to molecular shape,\nportion polarity, and molecular rigidity. These differences are\nlikely to affect the surface conformation of the protein and thus\nits surface damping properties, and also its bulk properties such\nas viscosity or its ability to form a gel. There is also likely to\nbe \u201csome\u201d difference between the behavior of polymeric\namphiphiles at O\/W and A\/W interfaces, and this has been\nwidely reported over the past two decades.\nFour systems were used to compare and in some way give\nan estimate of a \u201creal\u201d surface viscosity. These were protein\nalone and three various mixtures of Tween 20 with proteins.\nThe ratio (Figure 6) is very close to 1.0 for both BLG and R )\n0.05 Tween with BSA systems and slightly less so for the R )\n0.09 Tween with BLG system (minus 10%). These ratios were\nselected because they correspond to the decrease in foam\nstability on inclusion of competing surfactant discussed at length\npreviously (18, 21, 22, 25). In this way they were considered\nto be appropriate models for the change from polymer- to mainly\nsurfactant-stabilized interfaces and interesting candidate systems\nfor interfacial modeling.\nThe fourth piece of data, for diluted BLG and excess Tween\n20 (R ) 1000), does not match as closely to the extrapolated\nexperimental values of 0.070 mNs\/m at 0.17 mNs\/m and is\nobserved on the plot at a ratio of 2.4. This is still substantially\nlower that the \u223c3.7 mNs\/m viscosity values seen with the\nproteins tested. It seems that the technique is less substantive\nfor prediction of very low \u201cviscosities\u201d than seen with polymeric\nsystems such as protein-stabilized interfaces. Nevertheless, the\ntechnique we use is able to clearly distinguish the properties of\na \u201cfluid\u201d (simple surfactant) interface from those of a more rigid\n(protein) interface, and to this extent the simple and easily\napplied, rapid technique serves a particular purpose for the\nexamination of foods and pharmaceutical polymer mixtures.\nFigure 6 also shows a cartoon for each of the three distinct\ntypes of surfaces thought to exist in the solutions examined.\nSystem 1 is an interconnected interfacial layer, showing\nconsiderable lateral cohesion, and is thought to exist as a series\nof interconnected polymer molecules or interconnected ag-\ngregates of polymer molecules. This type of system is thought\nto exhibit considerable levels of viscoelasticity and is envisaged\nto be present with polymer-only systems or where the level of\ncompeting surfactant is too low to have a measurable interfacial\nimpact.

This was certainly observed for BLG in the presence of\nlecithin (LPC)-based surfactants using surface dilatational\nelasticity measurements (21). The third scenario, with an excess\nof surfactant, resembles the interface in the presence of\nsurfactant alone (with minimal levels of protein inclusion that\nmay or may not have much impact). Here, lateral interactions\nbetween adjacent surfactant molecules are weak when compared\nto those found between proteins, and the interfacial viscoelas-\nticity is low.Thesecondscenario isexpectedforsurfactant-protein\nmolar ratios (R) of less than, for example, 0.1 but unlikely to\nexist at R ) 1000. At such high surfactant concentrations the\ninterfacial layer is fluid and exemplified by our system 3. It is\nlikely that intermediary combinations of all three systems also\nexist, but this would depend on the protein, its interfacial\nconcentration, and its scope for interfacial desorption and\nintermolecular cross-linking (4, 14, 27, 28).\nAn important consideration in the pragmatic use of the results\nof the rheometer is to assess their value with respect to food\nand other complex bionanotechnologically related systems (13).\nIn this case, unlike the \u201cmodel and simplified\u201d systems often\ndescribed in this paper and the macroscopic planar interfaces\nexamined, there may be interaction between the interfacially\nadsorbed material and material contained within the bulk phase\nor entrained liquid that is found within a foam or emulsion\nlamella. The latter is a common occurrence in protein-stabilized\nemulsions and foams, particularly with multiphase media such\nas foods in which there is undoubtedly an interaction between\nadsorbed layers and polymer, lipid micelles, ice, or other\naggregates and crystals (6) that constitute or form part of the\ndispersion phase. Such interactions are likely to strongly affect\ndamping; however, by using suitable experimental reference\nenvironments (solutions) under which this additive behavior is\nnot so pronounced, it may be possible to elaborate further on\nthe mechanisms involved and indicate the extent of such\ninteractions and their relative predominance over the measured\neffects of the surface adsorbed layer itself. We believe our\napproach is powerful in that it should enable the user to measure\nsuch phenomena, but it will be difficult and challenging to\ndirectly disaggregate the individual elements of the measured\ndamping and identify the exact source of this damping directly\nfrom the data. Typically, in such a case when the bulk viscosity\n(consistency; viscoelasticity) and its intrinsic contribution to\ndamping are very high, suitable adjustment may be required or\nmay not be possible. Our aim is to test these possibilities in\nfuture work when we progress from simpler systems to more\nrealistic models of \u201cliquid-like\u201d food and pharmaceutical\/\nnutraceutical dispersions.\nIn experimentally tested (more dilute) solutions, this bulk\nphase enhancement of measured damping contribution over that\nof the continuous water phase (taken as a control) is negligible,\nyet interestingly, it may be possible using suitable time-related\ncalibration studies to get a \u201cscaling\u201d of the depth of this\ninteraction. There is strong experimental evidence to suggest\nthat both thixotropy and rheopexy within the measured surface\nlayer (and subphase) and development of molecular associations\nand entanglements are time-related events (14). When these\ntypes of concentration regimens are used and the likely\nmagnitude of effects seen with highly viscous bulk phases is\nconsidered, judgment of this influence over the total measured\ndamping will take a more pragmatic delineatory approach. It\nis, however, the case that the pendulum device bob and its\nvertically tapered \u201csharp\u201d edge are purposely in contact with\nthe smallest portion of the bulk phase, and thus bulk phase\ndamping tends to minimize given this geometry. At present we\nhave not looked at \u201csolutions or slurries\u201d with this degree of\nextensive contribution to measured damping, and accordingly\nat the relevant point some appropriate alterations and a\nmodification to the equipment methodology may be considered.\nThe foaming apparatus and its ability to predict or reflect\ninterfacial composition is now reasonably well understood (7).\nIts value lies in providing an additional picture when combined\nwith tensiometry to more fully describe various interfacial\nstructures and their influence on the gross properties of food\nand other industrial preparations. The composition has an\nundisputed impact on the physical texture and mouthfeel and\nvisual assessment of shelf life and in some cases on the chemical\nshelf life of food products by permitting incorporation, seques-\ntration, or exclusion of preservatives (12) or degradation\nproducts (19, 28).\nThere are some drawbacks associated with this new rheo-\nlogical equipment, which include its oversimplification, modular\ncomposition, and rapid nature of measurement. For many\nexperienced rheologists this oversimplification presents itself\nas providing little theoretical information that might be inap-\npropriately judged to reveal little value in the approach. We\nfind the technique more valuable because it generates a\nnumerical index with which to compare samples rather simply\ngenerating elasticity or viscosity values that are obtained from\nmathematical dissection of an output signal (27). In the case of\ncomplex samples this transition between mainly viscous, mainly\nelastic, and weakly viscoelastic interfaces presents problems in\nterms of trying to create a simple rationale or replicating\nexperimental conditions for selection of an appropriate mix of\ningredients and can be subject to small changes in pH, ionic\nstrength, or temperature, which lead to differing extents of\naggregation of polymers with time (14). The technique should\nbe of considerable use to those scientists requiring a simplified\npicture of the interfacial loading of materials and a reflection\nof interfacial composition as a route to greater understanding\nof real food products rather than theoretical work with highly\npurified food-grade proteins, emulsifiers, and texturizing polysac-\ncharide gums and synthetic polymers. One of our future aims\nis to test the device on real liquid samples such as beer and\nmilk. The second is to be able to resolve the makeup of solutions\nfollowing the dissolution of mixtures of powdered ingredients,\nand the third could involve assessment of the influence of the\npresence of naturally occurring functionality boosting agents.\nIn conclusion, the interfacial rheometer is used to assess the\ndamping of adsorbed layers assembled on aqueous solvents.\nPolymers appear to produce much greater surface damping than\nsimple surfactants. The extension of our work is to use the\nrheology apparatus to comparatively probe the synergistic or\nantagonistic effects seen when binary or more complex mixtures\nof surface-active ingredients are used. Further work might\ninclude the actual determination of elastic and viscous elements\nof the determined surface damping parameter. Although the\nprecise value of this complex information for routine assessment\nof food mixtures is not clear, the rheometer mentioned here is\nrobust and simple and provides enough detail to be able to test\ndifferent samples of food ingredients.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nD.K.S. thanks Drs.
