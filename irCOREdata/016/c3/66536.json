Introduction\n[2] The topography of tectonically active landscapes is\nthe consequence of geomorphic processes acting on the\ntime-integrated tectonic displacement field. However, de-\nspite numerous studies of the interactions between tectonics\nand erosion, development of predictive models of the\ntopographic response to tectonic activity has been problem-\natic, in part because it is generally difficult to determine the\ndisplacement field associated with growing structures. Ide-\nally, we require a system in which topography evolves in\nresponse to a simple displacement field over a single active\nstructure and in which snapshots of the structure and the\nlandscape are available at different stages of topographic\ndevelopment [e.g., Hetzel et al., 2004].\n[3] Studies of the scaling relationships of normal faults\nhave established a clear proportionality between fault length\nand displacement [e.g., Cowie and Scholz, 1992a; Dawers et\nal., 1993; Schlische et al., 1996], and this provides a simple,\nconvenient framework for considering the direct relation-\nships between tectonic displacements and topographic evo-\nlution. Interpretation of the fault displacement length data\nhas led to the recognition that crustal-scale normal fault\narrays grow by a combination of displacement accumula-\ntion, lateral tip propagation, and linkage of adjacent seg-\nments [e.g., Anders and Schlische, 1994; Cowie, 1998;\nMorewood and Roberts, 1999; Dawers and Underhill,\n2000; McLeod et al., 2000; Cowie et al., 2000]. These\nprocesses of fault growth have found wide application in\nunderstanding the rates and patterns of subsidence in hang-\ning wall basins [Gupta et al., 1998; Morley, 1999; Cowie et\nal., 2000; McLeod et al., 2000]. What is much less clear is\nthe effect of fault growth on the evolution of associated\nmountain ranges and on patterns of denudation. Does the\nproportionality between fault length and displacement give\nrise to a similar relationship between fault length and\ntopographic relief? If not, when and how does the surface\ntopography become an imperfect reflection of the underly-\ning tectonic displacement field? Harbor [1997], for exam-\nple, recognized that analysis of active normal faults with a\nrange of total displacements could be used to generate a\ncomposite model of footwall denudation; however, he did\nnot consider lateral fault growth and the consequences for\nalong-strike variations in denudation and sediment supply.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, F03001, doi:10.1029\/2003JF000115, 2004\n1Institute of Geology, Department of Earth Sciences, Eidgeno\u00a8ssische\nTechnische Hochschule Zu\u00a8rich, Zurich, Switzerland.\n2Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Tulane University,\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, USA.\n3Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College,\nLondon, UK.\n4Now at Department of Geosciences, University of Arizona, Tucson,\nArizona, USA.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2003JF000115$09.00\nF03001 1 of 16\nHetzel et al. [2004] argued that small thrust-bounded ranges\nin northeastern Tibet have suffered minimal erosion and\ntherefore preserve the details of the underlying tectonic\ndisplacement field.\n[4] Here we explore the relationship between fault growth\nand topographic evolution by examining the topography of\nsimple ranges formed by displacement on a series of normal\nfaults in the northeastern Basin and Range Province, west-\nern United States. We take advantage of two key spatial\nvariations: (1) displacement increases with increasing fault\nlength according to a well-defined linear relationship for our\nchosen set of faults, which allows us to use fault length as a\nproxy for time in understanding footwall development; and\n(2) displacement increases from the tips of each fault toward\nthe strike center [e.g., Cowie and Roberts, 2001], which\nallows us to use along-strike position as a proxy for time in\nunderstanding the response of the footwall to lateral fault\ngrowth and tip propagation. Because the faults are active\nand the regional topography is fairly simple, it is straight-\nforward to recognize, and separate, the topography gener-\nated by fault displacement from the inherited prefaulting\nlandscape. We demonstrate that fault growth and displace-\nment accumulation are accompanied by topographic varia-\ntions that are consistent between different ranges, and we\nconclude by outlining a predictive model of the evolution of\ntopography during extensional faulting.\n2. Study Area\n2.1. Regional Setting\n[5] The study area is located at the northeastern margin of\nthe Basin and Range Province, north of the Snake River\nPlain (Figure 1). Importantly for our study, active exten-\nsional faults in this region show a monotonic increase in\nfault length, from <20 km long in the northeast to \u0001150 km\nlong in the southwest (Figure 2). This systematic spatial\nvariation in fault length has been previously ascribed to\npassage of the Yellowstone hot spot and progressive fault\nactivation in its parabolic wake [Anders et al., 1989; Pierce\nand Morgan, 1990; Anders, 1994]. An advantage for our\nFigure 1. Location map showing active faults in the northeastern Basin and Range Province, western\nUnited States, for which we have length and throw estimates. The faults analyzed are shown in bold. Ball\nand ticks are on the hanging wall block. The inset shows the spatial migration of volcanic calderas\nassociated with the Yellowstone hot spot (M. Anders, personal communication, 2004). Caldera age varies\nfrom oldest (white) in the southwest to youngest (black) in the northeast. Fault names are as follows: BeF,\nBeaverhead fault; BF, Blacktail fault; CF, Centennial fault; DF, Deadman fault; LaF, Lamar fault; LeF,\nLemhi fault; LRF, Lost River fault; MCF, Muddy Creek fault; RRF, Red Rock fault; SCF, Stone Creek\nfault; SV-GVF, Swan Valley-Grand Valley fault; SF, Sweetwater fault; and TF, Teton fault.\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n2 of 16\nF03001\nstudy is that regionally exposed Tertiary volcanic units\nassociated with the hot spot have been used to determine\ntilt rates, onset of deformation, and overall basin geometry\non several of the faults, particularly the Beaverhead and\nLemhi faults [Rodgers and Anders, 1990; Anders et al.,\n1993; Anders and Schlische, 1994]. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the timing of the onset of activity is poorly\nconstrained, particularly for the shorter faults. Pleistocene\nand, in some cases, probable Holocene scarps are present\nalong at least portions of all of the faults, indicating\ncontinued activity to very recent time [Crone and Haller,\n1991; Haller et al., 2000; Janecke et al., 2001].\n2.2. Fault Displacement Length Scaling\n[6] The active normal faults in the circum\u2013Snake River\nPlain region display a strong positive correlation between\ncumulative fault throw (d) and total length (L) (Figure 2).\nThe data in Figure 2 include most of the faults in this study,\nfor which lengths and displacements are described below.\nAlso included in Figure 2 are data for several other faults in\nthe northeastern Basin and Range. Error estimates are often\nnot reported in the original studies; where further informa-\ntion has been given or a range of estimates are reported,\nthese are noted in the figure caption. For the data as a\nwhole, throw is linearly related to fault length with a d\/L\nratio of 0.03. This systematic increase in fault displacement\nwith increasing fault length permits us to use fault length as\na proxy for time in understanding the evolution of moun-\ntainous topography.\n[7] It is important to note that the larger faults in Figures 1\nand 2 are segmented structures that have grown in part by\nlinkage [e.g., Anders and Schlische, 1994]. Crustal-scale\nnormal faults, like those in the Basin and Range, are\ncomposed of large-scale segments whose lengths (typically\n\u000110\u201320 km) are likely scaled in some way by the thickness\nof the seismogenic crust [Jackson and White, 1989]. During\nfault growth, these segments are linked into a fault array that\nmechanically acts as a single fault [e.g., Dawers and\nAnders, 1995] such that the central segments have higher\nrates of displacement and greater cumulative slip than do\nthe tip segments [Cowie, 1998; Cowie and Roberts, 2001].\nWhile the sites of segment linkage may show small local\nminima in cumulative displacement [Dawers and Anders,\n1995; McLeod et al., 2000], these are not sites of long-term\ndisplacement deficit and hence are not sites of greatly\nreduced footwall topographic elevation or relief [e.g.,\nAnders and Schlische, 1994].\n2.3. Active Faults in the Study Area\n[8] We focus on footwalls adjacent to six presently active,\nnorthwest striking normal faults, which from northeast to\nsouthwest are the Stone Creek, Sweetwater, Blacktail, Red\nRock, Beaverhead, and Lemhi faults (Figure 1). These faults\nform part of the youngest (Miocene to recent) generation of\nextensional structures recognized by Janecke et al. [2001]\nand can be sensibly divided into three groups: single-\nsegment faults, two-segment faults, and multisegment\nfaults. By comparing footwall topography for different\nfaults of similar length, we reduce the chance that the\npeculiarities of a single fault will influence our interpreta-\ntions of footwall development.\n2.3.1. Single-Segment Faults: Stone Creek and\nSweetwater\n[9] The northeast dipping Stone Creek and Sweetwater\nfaults (Figure 3a) cut the central Ruby Range of southwest\nMontana, which is composed largely of Archean metamor-\nphic rocks [Garihan et al., 1982; Ruppel et al., 1993]. The\nRuby Range was tilted to the southeast in the footwall of a\nlarge, northeast striking normal fault during early to middle\nMiocene extension (Figure 3a) [Fritz and Sears, 1993;\nSears and Fritz, 1998; Janecke et al., 2001, set 4]. In\nmap view the 12-km-long Stone Creek fault is partly\nFigure 2. Relationship between fault length and throw\n(vertical displacement) for active normal faults in the\nnortheastern Basin and Range Province. Fault locations are\nas in Figure 1 (except for the Wasatch fault in central Utah).\nThe shaded line shows the best-fit linear regression through\nthe data; this relationship is almost identical to that\ncalculated by Schlische et al. [1996] for a range of data\nover eight orders of magnitude in fault length (note that\nalthough Schlische et al. [1996] referred to displacements,\nmuch of their normal fault data was reported in terms of\nthrow, as shown here). Because errors in reported throw\nvalues are not generally known, error bars show conserva-\ntive error estimates of \u00b120% of total throw. Fault names and\nsources of data are as follows: 1, Lamar fault, minimum\nestimate based on offset of Pliocene rhyolite [Love, 1961];\n2, Blacktail fault, maximum estimate (see text) [Haller et\nal., 2000]; 3, Red Rock fault, maximum estimate (see text)\n[Haller et al., 2000]; 4, Deadman fault, minimum estimate\nbased on basin thickness and footwall relief [Scholten and\nRamspott, 1968]; 5, Centennial fault, minimum estimate\nbased on offset of Huckleberry Ridge tuff [Johns et al.,\n1982]; 6, Teton fault, estimate from gravity and seismic\nmodeling [Byrd et al., 1994]; 7, Star Valley-Grand Valley\nfault, maximum estimate based on rotation of volcanic units\nand an assumed dip of 50\u0001 [Anders, 1990]; 8, Lost River\nfault, maximum estimate based on offset pre-Tertiary units\n[Janecke et al., 1991]; 9, Beaverhead fault, maximum\nestimate based on rotation of volcanic flows and flexural\nmodeling [Rodgers and Anders, 1990; Anders et al., 1993];\n10, Lemhi fault, maximum estimate based on rotation of\nvolcanic flows and flexural modeling [Janecke et al., 1991;\nAnders et al., 1993]; 11, Wasatch fault, minimum estimate\nbased on fluid inclusion data [Parry and Bruhn, 1987].\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n3 of 16\nF03001\ncoincident with a Proterozoic ductile shear zone that was\nreactivated as a left reverse oblique slip structure during\nLaramide deformation [Garihan et al., 1982]. Late Ceno-\nzoic normal displacement on the later, brittle Stone Creek\nfault is shown by deformation of Miocene and Pliocene\nsediments in the Ruby Basin [Monroe, 1976] and by meter-\nscale scarps in Quaternary deposits. Although the total\nthrow on the Stone Creek fault is unknown, the height of\nthe range front along this fault suggests that it must be at\nleast 250 m.\n[10] The 18-km-long Sweetwater fault (Figure 3b) is\nparallel to the Stone Creek fault and is also partly coincident\nwith a Proterozoic-to-Laramide-aged shear zone [Garihan\net al., 1982; Fritz and Sears, 1993]. The presently active\ntrace of the fault is marked by a right-stepping series of 1- to\n2-m-high scarps in alluvium and colluvium and by a series\nof aligned springs and seeps (Figure 4a). Inception of active\ndeformation postdates emplacement of the 6.0 \u00b1 0.1 Ma\nTimber Hill Basalt [Kreps et al., 1992; Fritz and Sears,\n1993], which is offset 215 \u00b1 10 m at a point 3.5 km from the\nsoutheastern tip of the fault (Figure 3b). The total throw on\nthe Sweetwater fault is unknown, but if the displacement\nmaximum occurs near the strike center of the fault, then the\ntotal throw must be at least 215 m.\n2.3.2. Two-Segment Faults: Blacktail and Red Rock\n[11] The northeast dipping Blacktail fault is 49 km long\nand bounds the northeastern side of the Blacktail Mountains\n(Figure 5a). There is some confusion in the literature over\nthe location, timing, and extent of displacement on the\nBlacktail fault [Haller et al., 2000]; the map of the presently\nactive fault in Figure 5a is based largely on our field\nobservations and corresponds to the Northwest and Cotton-\nwood segments of Haller et al. [2000]. Previous workers\nhave reported aligned springs and offset of Quaternary\ndeposits along most of the mapped trace [Stickney and\nBartholomew, 1987; Tysdal, 1988; Pierce and Morgan,\n1990].\n[12] Maximum footwall relief on the Blacktail fault is\n800 m, so the total throw must be somewhat greater because\nof footwall erosion and hanging wall subsidence; Haller et\nal. [2000] suggested \u00011 km of structural relief. Fritz and\nSears [1993] reported that the Blacktail fault offsets the\n6.0 \u00b1 0.1 Ma Timber Hill Basalt by several hundred meters.\nSignificant displacement on the fault must postdate the\n2.0 Ma Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, which caps a bajada\nsurface formed of Sixmile Creek Formation near the south-\nern end of Blacktail Deer Creek Valley [Fritz and Sears,\n1993; Lonn et al., 2000].\nFigure 3.

[2000], we interpret the active Red Rock fault to be\n50 km long, corresponding to the Timber Butte and Sheep\nCreeks segments of Haller et al. [2000]. Like the Blacktail\nfault, the active trace of the Red Rock fault is marked by a\nseries of Quaternary scarps and prominent triangular facts\n(Figure 4b). Total throw is \u00011 km but is poorly constrained\n[Haller et al., 2000]. Fritz and Sears [1993] argued that\ninitial surface uplift of the Red Rock footwall is constrained\nto between 6 and 5.5 Ma on the basis of dated basalt flows\nthat flowed across the footwall, but they did not show\nsupporting evidence for this claim.\n2.3.3. Multisegment Faults: Beaverhead and Lemhi\n[14] The southwest dipping Beaverhead fault (Figure 6a)\nis 150 km long and was subdivided into six segments by\nCrone and Haller [1991]. Morphologically, the fault is\nmarked by a linear mountain front, well-developed catch-\nment-fan systems, and abundant geomorphic indicators of\nactive base level fall, such as triangular facets and scarps in\nQuaternary alluvium (Figure 4c). Rodgers and Anders\n[1990] estimated 2.5 km of hanging wall subsidence on\nthe Nicholia segment, \u000130 km from the southeastern tip,\nwhile Anders et al. [1993] suggested a basin depth of 3.3 km\nalong the same segment. Anders et al. [1993] also calculated\nmaximum footwall rock uplift of 2.9 \u00b1 0.7 km based on\ntilted volcanic rocks along both the Nicholia and Blue\nDome segments. Taken together, these data indicate a total\nthrow of at least 5\u20136 km on the Beaverhead fault.\n[15] The timing of fault initiation is constrained by\nobservations in both the footwall and hanging wall. The\nfootwall of the Leadore segment contains upper middle\nEocene to lower Miocene rocks of the Horse Prairie Basin\n(Figure 6a) [VanDenburg et al., 1998; Janecke et al., 2001],\nand Nichols [1976, 1979] inferred local deposition in what\nwould become the Beaverhead footwall in late Miocene\ntime, implying that substantial rock uplift and incision of\nthe footwall must have occurred later. Tilted volcanic rocks\nin the Blue Dome segment hanging wall are consistent with\ndisplacement commencing after 5.4 Ma near the center of\nthe segment and at 3\u20134 Ma near the Nicholia-Blue Dome\nrelay zone [Rodgers and Anders, 1990] (Figure 6a).\n[16] The southwest dipping Lemhi fault (Figure 6b) is\nalso 150 km long and has been subdivided into six [Crone\nand Haller, 1991] or seven [Janecke, 1993] segments.\nMorphologically, the footwall appears very similar to that\nof the Beaverhead fault. Tilts of volcanic rocks in the\nfootwall of the Howe segment are consistent with \u00012.5 km\nof footwall rock uplift after deposition of the 6.5 Ma tuff of\nBlacktail [Anders et al., 1993]. Bouguer gravity lows on the\nLemhi and Beaverhead hanging walls are comparable in\nmagnitude [Bankey et al., 1985], suggesting similar depths\nto prefaulting bedrock. These data imply at least 5\u20136 km of\ntotal throw on the Lemhi fault. Displacement on the Lemhi\nfault probably began in the late Miocene, as with the\nFigure 4.

Rodgers and Anders [1990] argued that\nsome displacement had already occurred on the southern-\nmost Howe segment before deposition of the 6.5 Ma tuff of\nBlacktail.\n3. Observations of Footwall Morphology\n3.1. Methods\n[17] We analyze footwall morphology along each fault\nusing U.S. Geological Survey National Elevation Dataset\ndigital elevation data, with a horizontal resolution of 30 m.\nThese data are relatively coarse, particularly for accurate\ndelineation of the small catchments draining the Stone\nCreek and Sweetwater footwalls. However, higher-resolu-\ntion (10 m) data are available for only part of the study area,\nso we use the same 30 m data in order to directly compare\nresults from all footwalls. For each fault we extract the\nfootwall catchments with areas >0.05 km2 that drain across\nthe map trace of the active fault (shown as the dark shaded\nareas in Figures 3, 5, and 6). As a first attempt at quanti-\nfying footwall morphology, we calculate the simplest pos-\nsible measures of these catchments: their area, relief, and\nmean slope.\n[18] To assess along-strike variations in footwall relief,\nwe project the extracted footwall catchments onto a fault-\nparallel profile. At each position along the profile we\ncalculate the maximum, mean, and minimum elevations\nin the fault-normal direction. Footwall relief at each point\nis the difference between the maximum and minimum\nelevations. This method is sensitive to small-scale varia-\ntions in plan-view catchment shape and is not a true\nmeasure of individual catchment relief because catch-\nments widen away from the fault, and in places the\nswath is not exactly fault-parallel. However, the method\nallows us to derive a continuous footwall relief profile\nand eliminates the issues inherent in arbitrary selection of\nan along-strike profile. As a check, we also calculate\nrelief in individual catchments as a function of outlet\nposition along strike; the overall patterns and length\nscales are very similar to those derived from the profile\nmethod.\n[19] Because we also suspect that relief in these tecton-\nically active footwalls may be somehow strength limited\n[e.g., Schmidt and Montgomery, 1995; Densmore et al.,\n1998; Ellis et al., 1999], implying a relationship between\ntopographic slope and relief, we also calculate the average\ncatchment slopes within the extracted regions. We deter-\nmine the mean topographic slope for each catchment, using\nslope values measured over a 3 \u0003 3 cell (90 \u0003 90 m)\nwindow. It is clear that slope estimates using the 30 m\nresolution digital elevation model will significantly under-\nestimate true meter-scale slope values, but these estimates\nprovide a useful means of comparing slopes averaged over\nthe scale of individual hillslopes, both along strike and\nbetween different footwalls.\n3.2. Catchment Patterns\n3.2.1. Single-Segment Faults\n[20] Both the Stone Creek and the Sweetwater faults cut\nacross a smooth low-relief surface developed on Archean\nFigure 5. (a) Blacktail fault.

The faults define small range\nfronts that are steep and linear near the fault strike centers\nand become more diffuse and difficult to separate from the\ninherited topography of the Ruby Range block near the fault\ntips (Figure 3). Both footwalls show a symmetric map-view\ncatchment pattern in which the smallest catchments occur\nnear the fault strike centers, which we infer to be at or close\nto the displacement maxima (Figures 7a and 7b). Catchment\nareas increase progressively toward the fault tips. The\nlocation of the smallest catchments near the strike center,\nclose to the inferred displacement maximum, is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. All else being equal, higher displacements\nnear the fault midpoint should lead to higher rates of\nfootwall incision and therefore larger, more widely spaced\ncatchments [Wallace, 1989; Hovius, 1996; Talling et al.,\n1997]. Both footwalls are composed almost exclusively of\nArchean gneiss [Ruppel et al., 1993] so that lithology\nshould not be a significant control on catchment size.\n3.2.2. Two-Segment Faults\n[21] The Blacktail and Red Rock footwalls show greater\nvariation in the along-strike distribution of catchment areas\nthan the single-segment footwalls (Figures 7d and 7e). The\nlargest catchments, the Beaverhead River and Blacktail\nDeer Creek in the Blacktail footwall and Big Sheep and\nLittle Sheep Creeks in the Red Rock footwall, are anteced-\nent to the faults, based on their regional extent and conti-\nnuity across several footwall blocks. Of the catchments that\nhave developed in response to fault displacement, no\ndistinct pattern emerges. We interpret this as being due in\npart to fault tip propagation into areas of significant pre-\nfaulting topography. For example, as the northwestern tip of\nthe Red Rock fault propagates into the northern Tendoy\nRange, preexisting east flowing drainage systems are incor-\nporated into the growing footwall (Figure 5b). Likewise,\nincorporation of the Sheep Creeks segment into the fault\narray has added several large catchments to the southeastern\nend of the footwall (Figure 5b).\nFigure 6. (a) Beaverhead fault. Symbols are as in Figure 3. The fault trace is modified from Skipp\n[1984] and Janecke et al. [2001].

Multisegment Faults\n[22] Although we analyze the full 150 km length of the\nBeaverhead footwall, we focus on the southern portion of\nthe footwall because the northern end is complicated by the\nreactivation of an Eocene fault, resulting in considerable\ninherited topography and basin development (Figure 6a)\n[Crone and Haller, 1991; Janecke et al., 2001]. Catchment\nareas in the Beaverhead footwall show a clear variation with\nalong-strike position, both within individual segments and\nwithin the fault array as a whole (Figure 7e). Within each\nsegment the largest catchments occur near the strike center\nof the segment, and catchment size decreases toward the\nsegment tips. Likewise, the largest catchments within\nthe footwall occur close to the center of the array, within\nthe Leadore segment (Figure 6a); curiously, they are asso-\nciated with the locations of Paleogene basin deposits now\nexposed within the Beaverhead footwall [Janecke et al.,\n2001]. Thus the pattern of catchment size along the Beaver-\nhead and Lemhi faults is the opposite of that observed along\nthe single-segment faults. Interestingly, with the possible\nexception of the Mollie Gulch-Lemhi relay zone, none of\nthe relay zones between adjacent segments coincide with\nlarge footwall catchments. This contradicts the widely held\nbelief that relay zones invariably host large drainage basins\n(see the discussion by Densmore et al. [2003]).\n[23] For the Lemhi fault we focus here on only the southern\n\u0001115 km of the footwall, corresponding to the southernmost\nfive segments of Janecke [1993], for two reasons: (1) as with\nthe Beaverhead fault, only the southern end of the fault has a\nclear gradient in footwall topography decaying to zero at the\nfault tip and (2) the geometry and displacements on the\nnorthernmost two segments on the Lemhi fault are compli-\ncated by the presence of a Paleogene normal fault in the\nfootwall [Turko and Knuepfer, 1991; Janecke, 1993]. Over-\nall, the distribution of catchment areas in the Lemhi footwall\nis similar to that in the Beaverhead (Figure 7f ). Catchment\nareas generally decrease both toward the southern tip of the\nfault array and toward the tips of individual fault segments.\nUnlike the Beaverhead footwall, three of the four largest\ncatchments in the Lemhi footwall occur within relay zones\n(Figure 6b) [Leeder and Jackson, 1993].\n[24] The distribution of catchment areas on the Beaver-\nhead and Lemhi faults appears to mimic the expected along-\nstrike pattern of fault displacement: large catchments near\nthe strike center of the array and the strike centers of\nindividual segments and decreasing catchment size toward\nsegment and array tips.\n3.3. Footwall Relief\n3.3.1. Single-Segment Faults\n[25] The Stone Creek and Sweetwater faults have similar\npatterns of low but variable along-strike relief (Figures 8b\nand 8c). In both footwalls the highest relief is found at (1) the\nnorthwestern fault tips, where they intersect antecedent\ncatchments that drain the crest of the Ruby Range, and at\n(2) the southeastern tips, where they intersect the antecedent\nSage Creek and Sweetwater Creek catchments. Maximum\nfootwall elevations along both swaths clearly show the\nsoutheastward tilting of the Ruby Range footwall that devel-\noped during Miocene extension (Figure 3). Relief created\nby activity on the modern Stone Creek and Sweetwater\nfaults is difficult to separate from this inherited topography\n(Figures 8b and 8c). Short-wavelength variations in footwall\nrelief near the fault strike centers show where catchment\nincision has occurred in response to fault displacement.\n3.3.2. Two-Segment Faults\n[26] In both the Blacktail and Red Rock footwalls,\nfootwall relief increases monotonically from zero to a\nmaximum of 800\u20131200 m over a distance of \u000115 km from\nthe northwestern fault tip and then stays within \u0001250 m of\nthis value before decaying again over a similar length scale\nto the other tip (Figures 8d and 8e). In the Blacktail\nfootwall, this symmetrical relief profile is broken by anom-\nalously high relief values near the southeastern tip associ-\nated with the antecedent Blacktail Deer Creek catchment\n(Figure 8d). Because the southeastern tip is situated within\n2\u20133 km of the west fork of Blacktail Deer Creek, much of\nthe catchment is not actually located within the footwall.\nNote that we have not included the antecedent Beaverhead\nRiver in the calculation of footwall relief for the Blacktail\nfault; the pattern of relief at the northwestern tip is compli-\ncated by the Beaverhead River and by inherited topography\nof Burns Mountain (Figure 5a).\n[27] The long-wavelength structure of footwall elevation\nin the Red Rock footwall is dominated by the antecedent\nBig Sheep Creek catchment, which leads to a prominent low\nin the projected elevation profiles (Figure 8e). Despite this,\nand despite the inherited topography at the northwestern\nfault tip, footwall relief along the Red Rock fault is\nstrikingly symmetric (Figure 5b).\n3.3.3. Multisegment Faults\n[28] The Beaverhead and Lemhi footwalls show the same\nbasic pattern of along-strike relief as the Red Rock fault\n(Figures 8f and 8g). Relief increases monotonically from\nzero at the southeastern fault tips to a maximum of 1000\u2013\n1500 m over distances of \u000115 km. Relief is then relatively\nuniform for up to 100 km across multiple fault segments,\ndespite systematic variations in maximum and minimum\nfootwall elevations (Figures 8f and 8g). As mentioned in\nsection 3.2.3, we do not attempt to quantify relief variations\nat the northwestern ends of these faults because of interfer-\nence with inherited topography and older generations of\nnormal faults and uncertainty over the location of the active\nfault tips [Janecke, 1993; Janecke et al., 2001].\n[29] In summary, tectonic relief on the shortest faults is\npartially obscured by inherited prefaulting topography and\nantecedent catchments. However, the \u00011 km of displace-\nment on the two-segment faults in our study area is\nsufficient to overcome some of this inherited relief. For\nmultiple-segment faults, footwall relief is approximately\nuniform along strike, with a monotonic increase in relief\nin a \u000115 km region adjacent to the fault tips. Surprisingly,\nthe large catchments in the centers of the long fault arrays\nand the individual segments are not accompanied by high\nfootwall relief; instead, relief appears insensitive to along-\nstrike position away from the tip regions. We explore the\nimplications of this important observation in section 4.2.\n3.4. Catchment Slopes\n[30] The single-segment Stone Creek and Sweetwater\nfootwalls have an along-strike pattern of mean catchment\nslopes that is strikingly different from that of relief. The\nhighest mean slopes of 17\u0001\u201320\u0001 coincide with the smallest\ncatchments near the strike centers, where the relief is\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n9 of 16\nF03001\nrelatively low (Figures 9a and 9b). In contrast, slope values\nfor the two-segment Blacktail and Red Rock footwalls\nare irregular within \u000115 km of the fault tip but reach\nmaximum values of 25\u0001\u201330\u0001 within a few kilometers of\nthe strike center, corresponding to the maxima in footwall\nrelief (Figures 9c and 9d). Likewise, the multisegment\nBeaverhead and Lemhi footwalls have highly variable catch-\nment slopes within 15 km of the tips but relatively constant\nslopes over much of the footwalls (Figures 9e and 9f). Slopes\non the Beaverhead footwall are variable but average 20\u0001\u2013\n25\u0001, whereas those in the Lemhi Range average 28\u0001. The\nvalues do not appear to be correlated to relay zones between\nadjacent segments, suggesting that the along-strike distribu-\ntion of catchment slopes is insensitive to the fault geometry or\nalong-strike position outside of the 15 km tip regions.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Conceptual Model of Footwall Development\nDuring Fault Growth\n[31] The broadly similar morphological observations for\nfootwalls of the same length and segmentation pattern in\nthe study area suggest a systematic, reproducible evolu-\ntion of footwall erosion during the growth of these fault\narrays. We summarize the main features of this evolution\nat three different snapshots during the fault growth\nprocess (Figure 10).\n4.1.1. Stage 1: Single-Segment Faults\n[32] At the first stage of footwall evolution in the north-\neastern Basin and Range the cumulative tectonic displace-\nment field of the growing fault is superimposed upon an\ninherited topography with its own drainage system and\ndistribution of relief (Figure 10). Until the tectonic displace-\nments exceed this inherited relief, all aspects of the footwall\ntopography will be dominated by the inherited landscape.\nThe tectonic displacement field first becomes visible near\nthe center of the fault, where the rate of base level fall is\ngreatest; there, small, steep, newly formed catchments incise\ninto the rising footwall. The relief structure of the footwall\nis a combination of this tectonically driven relief production\nand the inherited relief. It is important to note that while the\nantecedent catchments near the tips of growing fault may\nstill have relatively large areas and relief, they will be\nsubject to only low rates of base level change and so may\nFigure 8. Swath profiles of along-strike footwall relief for the six faults in the study area. (a) Cartoon\nshowing the relief calculation method. Relief is calculated by projecting footwall catchments (see\nFigures 3, 5, and 6) onto a fault-parallel profile. At each position along the profile the mean, maximum,\nand minimum elevations are calculated. The relief is defined as the difference between the maximum and\nminimum elevations at that position. (b\u2013g) Along-strike footwall relief profiles for the six footwalls.\nMean elevation (bold line) and elevation range from maximum to minimum (shaded field) are shown on\nthe upper scale of each diagram, while the relief (dark shaded line) is shown on the lower scale. Shaded\nbars show locations of relay zones between adjacent segments. Major footwall catchments are labeled.\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n10 of 16\nF03001\nnot necessarily contribute significant amounts of sediment\nto the developing basin [e.g., Densmore et al., 2003]. The\ndrainage divide along the range crest is strongly skewed\ntoward the fault in the center of the array, near the\ndisplacement maximum. This suggests that, at least locally,\nhigh displacement rates, coupled, in these footwalls, with\nresistant gneiss bedrock, effectively pin the divide close to\nthe fault [Ellis and Densmore, 2003]. In general, the along-\nstrike patterns of relief, slope, and area are quite different\nfrom those that develop later in the evolution of footwalls in\nthe study area.\n4.1.2. Stage 2: Two-Segment Faults\n[33] By the time initial segment linkage has occurred, the\nhighly symmetrical shape of the footwall relief profile has\nbecome apparent above the inherited topography (Figure 10).\nMost importantly, a \u000115 km tip region of monotonically\nincreasing relief has developed. This tip region is distinct\nfrom the center of the footwall, where relief reaches an\napproximately uniform value. However, other aspects of\nthe footwall are still in flux. Antecedent catchments continue\nto be important in the footwall drainage pattern; in fact, we\nhypothesize that the footwall may be more likely to intersect\nregional river systems as the fault array lengthens. Inherited,\nprefaulting topography, in the form of low-relief areas near\nthe range crest or preexisting ranges near the fault tips, may\nstill be present.\n4.1.3. Stage 3: Multisegment Faults\n[34] In this final stage, all inherited topography has been\nremoved through tectonic displacement and denudation.\nThe available footwall drainage area is fully parsed into\nconsequent catchments that have developed in response to\nfault activity (Figure 10). The largest catchments occur in\nthe centers of the fault segments and in the center of the\nfault array, as expected if the displacement profiles on\nindividual fault segments are similar to the displacement\nprofile on the entire fault array [Dawers and Anders, 1995].\nFootwall relief and catchment slopes are relatively constant\nacross the center of the fault array and across segment relay\nzones, implying that the relief is somehow limited beyond\nthe \u000115 km tip region.\n4.2. Implications of Uniform Relief\n[35] The relatively uniform footwall relief in the centers\nof the larger footwalls demonstrates that unlike displace-\nment, relief does not accumulate continuously during fault\narray growth. In the northeastern Basin and Range, relief is\nuniform only for parts of the footwall that are more than\n\u000115 km from the tip of the fault array, thus setting a\ncharacteristic along-strike length scale for relief generation.\nWe hypothesize, on the basis of the relatively constant\ncatchment slopes across most of the footwall, that relief is\nlimited by efficient denudation (Figure 11). Within \u000115 km\nFigure 8. (continued)\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n11 of 16\nF03001\nof the fault tips, fault displacement rates are relatively low,\nand denudation is correspondingly minor, leading to only\nsmall differences between the tectonic and actual topogra-\nphy (Figure 11). Beyond this 15 km length scale, however,\nthe footwall catchment-fan systems are sufficiently evolved\nso that the tectonic flux of material into the footwall is\nbalanced by the transfer of mass to the adjacent hanging\nwall. The planar, relatively steep hillslopes within the center\nof the footwall are consistent with a strength-limited land-\nscape [e.g., Schmidt and Montgomery, 1995; Densmore et\nFigure 9. Mean slopes of divide-forming catchments as a function of along-strike position for the six\nfaults in the study area. Slopes are calculated over a 90 \u0003 90 m area.\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n12 of 16\nF03001\nal., 1998]. In this sense, for all points greater than 15 km\nfrom the fault tips, the footwall has reached a statistically\nsteady relief, as defined by Ellis et al. [1999], such that the\ndetailed catchment pattern may vary over time, but the mean\nelevation and relief of the range will not. This situation is\nequivalent to a flux steady state of Willett and Brandon\n[2002].\n[36] An important corollary of this hypothesis is that if we\ncan assume that the fault array grows by relatively steady tip\npropagation, then the 15 km length scale is equivalent to a\nFigure 10. Conceptual model of footwall topographic development in the northeastern Basin and\nRange. Stage 0 shows the prefaulting topography, which may be inherited from an earlier phase of\ntectonic activity. Stage 1 shows the early stages of displacement on a single-segment fault; note that\nantecedent streams are diverted, but not defeated, and that the highest footwall relief is associated with\ninherited, rather than tectonic, topography. By Stage 2, the footwall has locally achieved steady state\nrelief, but aspects of the prefaulting landscape, such as antecedent rivers, are still present. In Stage 3 the\nfootwall topography is solely the result of denudation acting on the tectonic displacement envelope. A\n\u000115 km region of decreasing relief toward the fault tip has been established; outside of this region,\nfootwall relief is approximately uniform.\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n13 of 16\nF03001\ntimescale of relief generation. In other words, the along-\nstrike distance over which the limiting relief is reached is\nrelated to the time required to reach this relief by the fault\ntip propagation rate (Figure 11). This is a simple but\npowerful relationship as it provides a possible way of\nestimating a key timescale in footwall evolution. Unfortu-\nnately, very few data exist on rates of fault tip propagation,\nand true understanding of the timescales required for\ntopographic evolution in the Basin and Range will depend\nin part on accurate estimates of these rates. At present, we\ncan turn only to scaling arguments [Cowie and Scholz,\n1992b] that predict tip propagation rates that are propor-\ntional to slip rates and are \u000110\u2013100 mm yr\u00021 for faults\n\u000150 km long, broadly in line with very limited field\nobservations [e.g., Morewood and Roberts, 1999]. If an\naverage long-term propagation rate of 10 mm yr\u00021 is\nappropriate for the faults of the northeastern Basin and\nRange, then 15 km of tip propagation, and with it the\ngeneration of 1 km of footwall relief, will occur over a\ntimescale of \u00011 Myr.\n[37] The hypothesis of strength-limited relief also implies\nthat the only ways to increase footwall relief within the\ncenter of the footwall are to (1) increase the rock mass\nstrength or to (2) increase the available space for footwall\ntopography, i.e., the across-strike width of the range. Why\nshould range width not increase with increasing fault\ndisplacement? Range width is dependent on two things:\nthe width of the tectonic topography, which is a function of\nthe fault spacing and the elastic properties of the lithosphere\n[Scholz and Contreras, 1998], and the relative heights of\nbase level and basin fill on either side of the range [Ellis and\nDensmore, 2003]. Both of these function as external con-\ntrols on the geometry of the footwall and, with the exception\nof base level in the hanging wall, are not directly dependent\non fault displacement. Thus we do not expect range width,\nor catchment spacing, to increase monotonically with\nincreasing fault displacement, and in fact, cursory inspec-\ntion of Figure 6 shows that the width of both the Beaver-\nhead and Lemhi Ranges, while variable, is relatively\nconstant along strike, except near the tips.\n4.3. Climatic Influences\n[38] It seems likely that the timescale over which\nuniform footwall relief is reached should be proportional\nto the efficiency of surface processes in removing foot-\nwall material. Thus we expect a correlation between\nclimatic variables, such as precipitation, and the length\nor timescales required to reach uniform relief. For exam-\nple, if the long-term mean precipitation rate were higher\nin the study area, we would expect that (1) inherited\ntopography should be removed more quickly, (2) the\nfootwalls should reach their uniform relief in less time,\nand (3) the magnitude of that relief might well be\nconsiderably lower [e.g., Whipple et al., 1999; Bonnet\nand Crave, 2003]. For the same tip propagation rate the\nlength scale to reach uniform relief would then be less\nthan the observed 15 km. Unfortunately, we lack suffi-\ncient climatic data in the northeastern Basin and Range in\norder to investigate the effects of climate on local\nfootwall evolution. Historical mean annual precipitation\ngenerally increases from southwest to northeast across the\nstudy area, varying from 21 cm yr\u00021 in the hanging wall\nof the Beaverhead fault to 35 cm yr\u00021 near the Stone\nCreek fault [National Climatic Data Center, 2002a,\n2002b]. However, the available climate data come from\nstations located at relatively low elevations in the hanging\nwall basins. Recent experiments on orographic precipita-\ntion in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, where the local\nfootwall relief is \u00011200\u20131500 m, show enhancement of\nmeasured precipitation by up to an order of magnitude\nbetween hanging wall and footwall stations [Cheng, 2001;\nSteenburgh, 2003; Schultz and Trapp, 2003] so that\nhanging wall observations almost certainly underestimate\nthe actual precipitation that falls on the footwall catch-\nments. Nevertheless, these observations clearly demon-\nstrate the enhancement of orographic precipitation by\nfootwall topography. How the growth of footwall relief\ninitiates well-developed orographic precipitation patterns,\nthereby enhancing footwall erosion rates, remains a prob-\nlem of some interest. Additionally, the relationship be-\ntween footwall aspect, i.e., the direction of fault dip, and\ndelivery of precipitation by prevailing wind patterns is\nnot clear, although it is likely to play a role in the\nevolution of footwall topography [e.g., Ellis et al., 1999].\n[39] The observations of footwall morphology presented\nhere suggest and support, but do not prove, our hypothesis\nof erosionally limited footwall relief. A powerful test of the\nhypothesis would be provided by the along-strike distribu-\ntion of footwall denudation. Our results imply that denuda-\ntion should vary strongly with position along the fault array,\neven between areas of similar footwall relief, because of the\nalong-strike variation in displacement rate. Profiles of total\ndenudation and denudation rates, measured using cosmo-\ngenic radionuclide or low-temperature thermochronologic\nFigure 11. Schematic cross section of crustal-scale normal\nfault showing displacement envelope (outer line) and\nbedrock topography (shaded region). Denudation is the\ndifference between the displacement envelope and the\nfootwall topography. Basin sediments are not shown. Note\nthat in our conceptual model, footwall relief is low within\nthe tip region; beyond this characteristic length scale, relief\nis approximately uniform along strike. If the fault grows by\nsteady tip propagation, this length scale is related to the time\nrequired for relief generation by the fault tip propagation\nrate.\nF03001 DENSMORE ET AL.: CONTINENTAL EXTENSION FOOTWALL DEVELOPMENT\n14 of 16\nF03001\ntechniques, may thus shed some light on the precise\nmechanism and timing of footwall relief generation.\n5. Conclusions\n[40] Analysis of the topography of a set of active normal\nfaults in the northeastern Basin and Range Province allows us\nto track variations in footwall morphology both along strike\nand between faults of different lengths. Catchment geometry\nand footwall relief appear to evolve in a predictable way\nduring the growth of crustal-scale extensional faults in the\nstudy area. We propose a three-stage scenario of footwall\ndenudation and catchment development in the northeastern\nBasin and Range. For single-segment faults, inherited topog-\nraphy dominates the tectonic topography generated by fault\ndisplacement. As the fault arrays grow by segment linkage,\ntectonic topography becomes more apparent, and large, high-\nrelief catchments begin to form in the center of the footwall.\nContinued growth of the fault array and displacement accu-\nmulation leads to a pattern of footwall relief that is relatively\nuniform along strike, decaying to zero at the fault tips over a\nlength scale of \u000115 km. We hypothesize that this limited\nrelief most likely reflects the efficacy of surface processes in\nremoving footwall topography above a certain threshold\nrelief value. If the fault array grows by relatively steady tip\npropagation, then the tip length scale of \u000115 km should be\nproportional to the timescale required for generation of\nsteady state footwall relief.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
