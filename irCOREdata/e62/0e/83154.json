Impacts and Costs of Infant Crying and Sleeping Problems\nBabies who cry a lot or are unsettled at night have a variety of impacts on parents and \nhealth services.  First, because many parents find their babies\u2019 crying or sleep-waking \nhard to manage, these problems are troublesome for parents and costly for health \nservices.  For instance, in a national survey, 74% of American parents of 4-9 month \nold infants reported discussing infant night waking and fussing with paediatricians 1. \nIn the United Kingdom, the professional time devoted to discussing the problems with \nparents of 1-3 month-old infants costs the National Health Services about \u00a366million \nper year 2. Second, less commonly and more alarmingly, prolonged crying may trigger \n\u2018shaken baby syndrome\u2019, resulting in infant brain damage or death 3; 4.  Third, early \ncrying and sleeping problems are sometimes the prelude to long-term disturbances in \nparent-child relationships and psychological problems in school-aged children 5; 6; 7. \nThere is a need for evidence about the nature and causes of these problems and for its \ntranslation into services which support parents and babies cost-effectively.  The aim \nin this chapter is to summarise our current understanding and its implications for \nservices and research, with a focus on the first six months of infancy.  The concern \nwill be with crying and sleep-waking amount and pattern, rather than with sleep type \nindices such as Rapid Eye Movement sleep, since parents are usually unaware of \nthese 8.  Below, evidence will be considered adequate when it stems from at least two \nstudies from independent research groups (i.e. includes replication).   \n2. Distinguishing Infant Crying from Sleep-waking Behaviours and Infant from \nParental Problems\nAlthough crying and sleeping problems are not usually distinguished, they present \ndifferently, at different ages, often in different infants, and may well have distinct \n2\ncauses.  Infant crying and parental concern about it peak at around 5-6 weeks of age, \nwith most of the crying in the daytime and, particularly the evenings9; 10; 11.  In \ncontrast, infant \u2018sleeping problems\u2019 occur mainly at night, after three months of age12; \n13.  Most babies wake at night for feeding in the early weeks and parents expect this. \nParents report that most babies begin to \u2018sleep though the night\u2019 by about 12 weeks of \nage14; 15; 16.  It is the failure to achieve this milestone, so that infants continue to settle \npoorly or wake their parents at night after 12 weeks which accounts for most \u2018infant \nsleeping problems\u201913.  Emphasising the distinctness of crying and sleeping problems, a \nrecent randomised controlled trial found that a behavioural programme delivered by \nparents increased the number of infants who \u2018slept through the night\u2019 by 12 weeks of \nage, but did not affect 24-hour amounts of crying17.    \nAs well as this separation of crying from sleeping problems, it is important to \ndistinguish between the problem and the infant behaviour which underlies it. \nReviews of the evidence estimate that only about one in 10 infants taken by parents to \nprofessionals for infant crying problems have a food intolerance or other organic \ndisturbances18;19.  These parents are generally correct in judging that their babies cry \nmore than average amounts, but most infants who cry a lot in the first two months of \ninfancy are healthy, put on weight normally, and do not have long-term \ndisturbances18;20.  Details about their crying behaviour will be presented below, but \n\u2018infant crying problems\u2019  as a clinical complaint are characterised chiefly by parental \nalarm and concern about crying,  rather than by a pathological infant condition 18; 19.  \nLikewise, most infants who wake and disturb their parents at night beyond three \nmonths of age do not have general or long-term disturbances, other than continuing \n3\nsleeping problems21;22.  To a large degree, parental concern about infant night waking \nreflects Western cultural practices and norms23;24.   This does not downplay parental \ncomplaints, since parents who work Western office hours need to sleep at night \nthemselves, while it is true that most Western infants over three months of age remain \nsettled for long periods at night. Rather, the implication is that most infants who fail \nto develop this ability are in good health, so that the infant behaviour needs to be \ndistinguished from the, largely parental, problem.\nEmphasising these distinctions, epidemiological studies have found that most infants \nwho have crying problems do not have sleeping problems (and vice-versa).  Wolke et \nal\u2019s 22 epidemiological study of five month olds found that 11% of infants had \nsleeping problems, 10% crying problems, and just 5% had both types of problems, \nwhile sleeping problems, rather than amounts of crying at 5 months, predicted later \nsleeping problems.  Similarly, Von Kries et al. 21 found that prolonged crying in the \nfirst three months was not associated with increased rates of sleeping or feeding \ndifficulties.  Earlier reports that crying babies sleep less per 24 hours were probably \ndue to the inaccuracy of parent reports about non-criers, which exaggerate the \namounts these babies sleep because their parents are not aware of periods when they \nare awake but settled 25.  Lehtonen\u2019s review of follow-up studies of crying babies \nconcluded that most of them slept normally at a later age 20.  Likewise, Zuckerman, \nStevenson & Bailey 26 found that infants who had sleeping problems solely at eight \nmonths did not have later behaviour problems, whereas those with chronic sleep \nproblems continuing to three years of age were more likely to have additional \nbehaviour disturbances.           \n4\nThese findings have two implications.  First, the problem and infant behaviour \nunderlying it both need to be assessed, but considered separately.  Second, two main \ngroups of infants, and clinical phenomena, exist: infants who cry a lot in the day and \nevening in the first two months, and infants who fail to develop the ability to remain \nsettled at night by three months of age.  In addition, a much smaller third group of \ninfants has organic disturbances 18; 19. Recent research has identified a group of infants \nwho have multiple, crying sleeping and other problems which persist after three \nmonths of age and who have extensive psychological and family disturbances 5;21 . \nThe nature and causes of these different behavioural and developmental pathways will \nbe examined separately below.   \n3. Infant \u2018Colic\u2019 and the Infant Crying Peaks \nProlonged unexplained crying in early infancy has traditionally been attributed to \ngastrointestinal pain, as reflected in the term infant \u2018colic\u2019 27.  Recent studies have \nchallenged this assumption and led to a reconceptualisation. \nFirst, although prolonged crying can be due to food intolerance and other organic \ndisturbances during the first three months, these are absent in 90% of cases 18; 19. \nFurthermore, the evidence about the main organic conditions believed to cause crying \n\u2013 Gastroesopageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and food allergy \u2013 is equivocal.  For \nGERD, Heine\u2019s 28 review concluded that \u2018A direct causal relationship between acid \nreflux and colic therefore appears unlikely\u2019 (p.222).  For allergic (atopic) \ndisturbances, the recent evidence suggests a weak relationship, but is unclear about its \nnature.  Studying infants at familial risk of atopy, Kalliom\u00e4ki et al29 found that infants \nwho later showed eczema or asthma fussed (but did not cry) more at seven weeks, and \n5\ncried more at 12 weeks, than infants who did not develop eczema or asthma.   In \ncontrast, Castro-Rodriguez et al\u2019s30 prospective study of a large community sample \nfound no association between physician-reported colic in early infancy and markers of \natopy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, wheezing and bronchial constriction from nine months \nto 11 years of age.  Nor were rates of parental asthma or positive skin tests for allergy \nraised where infants had colic.  Heine\u2019s28 review concluded that colic is not usually \nassociated with raised infant serum IgE or food-specific IgE levels.  The most \nrigorous, randomised, controlled trial of the effects of a low-allergen diet for breast-\nfeeding mothers 31 found a much greater reduction in diary-measured infant \nfuss\/crying in the week after mothers began a low-allergen diet than occurred in \ncontrol-group infants.  However, the groups did not differ at outcome in the \nproportions of infants who \u2018still had colic\u2019 (defined as \u2265 180 minutes fuss\/crying per \n24 hours).  Moreover, neither maternal ratings of their infant\u2019s amount of crying at \noutcome, nor of whether colic behaviour was \u2018improved, the same or worse\u2019, differed \nbetween the treatment and control groups \u2013 implying that the low-allergen diet did not \nresolve the problem for parents.  The implications of this complex evidence for \nidentifying and treating organic colic cases will be revisited in Section 6. \nA second reason for reconceptualising  infant \u2018colic\u2019 is that studies which have gone \nbeyond clinically referred groups to include general community samples have found \nresemblances in crying behaviour, such that babies in general have a crying peak in \nthe first two months of infancy, with an evening clustering, followed by a marked \nreduction in crying by 12 weeks of age 9; 11.  This peak has been found too in non-\nWestern cultures, prompting the suggestion that it is a behavioural universal of \ninfancy9.  Most clinical cases appear to be at the extremes of the normal distribution, \n6\nrather than a separate group.  Further, the belief that the crying reflects pain has been \ndisputed both by studies which have compared crying bouts acoustically and by a \ncritical re-examination of the evidence that it is possible to tell the cause of crying \nfrom its sound 32; 33.  Rather than \u2018cry types\u2019 which reflect different underlying \npsychological states (pain; hunger; anger) reliably, infant crying in the early weeks is \nnow considered to be a \u2018graded signal\u2019 which conveys the infant\u2019s degree of distress, \nbut not the precise cause.  Caregivers have to work out the cause using experience and \ncontextual information.   It is thought that the chief features of early crying that \ndisturb parents are its relative intensity (a high cry: fuss ratio), the prolonged length of \nthe cry bouts, and the resistance of the crying to soothing techniques which usually \nstop babies from crying 34; 35.  The unsoothability of the crying is thought to be its \nmost salient feature, since this makes parents feel helpless and unable to manage 32. \nStudies where trained researchers have found such infants hard or impossible to \nsoothe have confirmed that this is an objective feature of the infants 34; 36.\nAlthough the cause of these long and unsoothable crying bouts is uncertain, recent \nanalyses have indicated that they are probably specific to early infancy 35.  Several \nresearchers have argued that they are linked to the reorganisation of brain systems \nwhich occurs at around two months of age, as reflex systems are replaced by cortical \ncontrol of behaviour 37; 38.  In particular, the long and unsoothable nature of the bouts \nhas been attributed to a temporary deficit in \u2018responsivity\u2019, so that infants are hyper-\nreactive or unable to regulate (stop) crying once it has started 39; 40.  Evidence for this \nhypothesis is so far equivocal, since parental diary reports show that 1-3 month old \ninfants who cry a lot have more cry bouts as well as longer ones 32; 35.  However, \naccurate separation of cry bouts may require more precise measurements than the \n7\nparental diary methods, used so far, allow.  A further challenge is that the two-month \n\u2018neuro-behavioural shift\u2019 involves changes to several systems, including attention , \nsensory, circadian and social abilities, such as the emergence of social smiling 38, as \nwell as changes in electroencephalographic activity 41.  Attempts to narrow down the \nneuro-physiological systems involved have so far not proved replicable, so that \nfurther research is needed to confirm this contemporary view of the causes of \nunsoothable crying in early infancy.  \nAs well as changes to endogenous infant systems, explanations of prolonged crying in \nearly infancy have attributed it to inadequate parenting.  In particular, early \nintervention studies showed that both increasing and decreasing parental response to \nthe crying reduced its amount 42; 43.  These studies have been criticised on \nmethodological grounds 44, but since intervention often quietens babies, reducing \noverall crying amount is neither difficult nor the point.  Unless interventions address \nthe prolonged unsoothable bouts which are the source of parents\u2019 concerns, they are \nunlikely to resolve the problem.  \nIn principle, the optimum research method in this area involves randomised, \ncontrolled designs, where groups are assigned arbitrarily to alternative forms of \nparenting.  In practice, two kinds of obstacle have been encountered.  First, the \nfindings have proved inconsistent.  For example, supplementary carrying reduced \ncrying preventively in one study 45 , but not in two subsequent replication attempts \nwhich achieved similar amounts of carrying 46; 47, while supplementary carrying in \nresponse to crying proved ineffective as a treatment 48.  Second, these \nsupplementation studies have achieved only modest changes in Western parents\u2019 \n8\nbehaviour, perhaps because they resist changes to their care.  A recent randomised \ncontrolled trial of the \u2018REST\u2019 nursing regime for helping parents to manage colic \nfound benefits for parents 49; 50, but used maternal subjective ratings of infant changes \nrather than validated measures of infant behaviour, so that it is not clear whether \ninfant crying was reduced.  Furthermore, mothers in the control group, who received \nmuch less support than the REST mothers, reported similar improvements, albeit of \nlesser degree.  The value for parents of professional consultations is highlighted by \nJordan et al\u2019s 51 randomised, controlled trial, which found that an infant mental health \n(IMH) consultation for mothers was as effective as anti-reflux medication and a \nplacebo prescription in reducing infant crying (with over 90% of mothers in all three \ngroups reporting that crying was improved), whereas fewer mothers receiving the \nIMH consultation were admitted to the hospital for crying-related stress.  The REST \nand similar approaches appear to provide valuable support for mothers, but research \nto uncover the nature of any effects on infant behaviour, and the cost-effectiveness of \nthese interventions, is needed.     \nComparative studies provide an alternative, if less methodologically robust, means of \nevaluating the consequences of parenting variables for infant crying.  Two studies \nspeak most directly to this issue.  First, Hubbard & van Ijzendoorn\u2019s 52; 53 careful \nobservations found no evidence that typical variations in how long Western parents \ntook to respond to crying predicted the amounts infants cried at later ages.  More rapid \nparental response in the first nine weeks was associated with small increases in crying \nfrequency in weeks 9-27, but the associations were modest and did not suggest any \neffect of early parental responsiveness on the amounts infants cried later on.\n9\nSecond, by including much greater variations in parenting, a recent cross-cultural \nstudy has shown quite different consequences for infant crying overall than for \nunsoothable crying bouts.  The methods used involved comparing three groups \nlongitudinally on parenting and infant crying: London parents; Copenhagen parents \n(who were expected to be more responsive); and parents who elected before their \nbabies\u2019 birth to practice \u2018Proximal care\u2019.  This anthropological term was chosen to \ndescribe the key feature of this form of parenting, extensive infant holding, in contrast \nto the common Western practice of putting babies down 54. Each of the groups \nincluded over 50 infants and infant and caregiver behaviour was measured by \nvalidated behaviour diaries. As expected, large group differences in parenting were \nfound when the infants were 10 days and five weeks of age.  Proximal care parents \nfed their babies more often than other groups (14, compared to 10-12 times, per 24 \nhours) and held their babies for an average of 15-16 hours per 24 hours, about twice \nas much as London parents, while Copenhagen parents fell in-between.  Proximal care \nparents co-slept throughout the night with their babies much more often than both \nother groups. London parents had 50% less physical contact with their babies than the \nother groups, both when settled and when crying, and abandoned breast-feeding \nearlier.\nThese differences in parenting were associated with substantial differences in amounts \nof infant crying.  The London babies fussed and cried 50% more than both other \ngroups at 10 days and five weeks of age. Fussing and crying declined at 12 weeks in \nall three groups, but remained higher in London infants.  In contrast, unsoothable \ncrying bouts were equally common in all three groups.  Likewise, infant colic \n10\n(defined as \u2265 180 minutes fuss\/crying per 24 hours), occurred equally often, in 5-13% \nof infants in each group, at five weeks of age.\nThese latest findings need careful interpretation until they are confirmed by \nrandomised controlled trials, but they are consistent with a good deal of supporting \nevidence. First, Sch\u00f6n & Keskivarra\u2019s 55 similar study of Western parents practicing \n\u2018natural parenting\u2019 found this to be associated with low amounts and, particularly, \nfrequencies of fuss\/crying.  Previous Danish and African studies, too, have found that \nhigh amounts of body contact and responsive parenting are associated with low \namounts of infant crying 56; 57; 58. Second, Harlow & Harlow\u2019s 59 primate and Hofer\u2019s60 \nrat studies have each documented infants\u2019 preference for body contact.  Hofer argues \nthat early crying evolved as a reflex behaviour that serves dual functions: a \ncommunicative function, which encourages maternal contact, and a homeostatic \nfunction by assisting recovery from hypothermia. In turn, early parenting acts as an \n\u2018external regulator\u2019 of infant physiological homeostasis 60.  Similarly, Greenough, \nBlack & Wallace 61 argued that some infant brain systems are \u2018experience-expectant\u2019, \nthat is, presuppose the existence of environmental conditions which are evolutionarily \ntypical. Thirdly, the finding that variations in parenting do not prevent the bouts of \nunsoothable crying which occur in early infancy is consistent with the evidence cited \nabove that these are specific to early infancy and linked to endogenous neuro-\ndevelopmental changes at this age.    \nIn sum, the best available evidence strongly indicates, but does not yet confirm, that \nunsoothable crying bouts are common and specific to early infancy, not affected by \nparenting, and probably due to neuro-developmental changes which are a normal part \n11\nof development.  In contrast, overall 24-hour amounts of crying are substantially \nreduced when parents adopt methods of care which involve more physical contact and \ngreater responsiveness.  Prolonged crying in the first three months can be due to food \nintolerance and other organic disturbances in a small number of cases.  The \nimplications of these findings for clinical practice will be revisited below.  \n \n4. Infant Sleeping and Sleeping Problems\nvan Gelder 62 summarises contemporary knowledge of sleep-waking mechanisms in \nadult mammals.  There is extensive evidence that the brain\u2019s suprachariasmatic \nnucleus provides the biological \u2018clock\u2019 upon which sleep-waking and other circadian \ncycles are based.  Environmental stimuli, including particularly the effects of light via \nphotoreceptors in the eye, can reset the clock.  Other environmental stimuli are less \nwell understood, but dynamic interplay between a variety of external and endogenous \nregulatory influences is probably involved.  Salzarulo et al 41, for example, identify \nrising body temperature and Rapid Eye Movement sleep as precursers of spontaneous \nwaking in adults. A further finding of importance here is that older children and adults \ndo not remain asleep at night for continuous periods of eight or more hours of time. \nRather, adult sleep involves brief awakening and re-settlings, so that continuous sleep \nperiods may not last more than six hours 23. \nDuring the first three months of age, most infants pass from a pattern of short sleep \nwake cycles which are more or less evenly distributed across the day and night to a \npattern involving consolidation of sleeping into long periods at night and waking into \nthe daytime 63; 64; 16.  Newborns have been said to lack day:night differences in sleep \nand waking, but some, parent-report, studies have found more sleep at night within \n12\nthe first two weeks of age 65; 66.  Studies involving even younger ages and other \nmethods are needed, but infants may be predisposed to show rudimentary circadian \nsleep-waking organisation from the first days of age.   \nThe crucial question of how this developmental progression takes place has so far \nyielded only a partial answer.  Arguably the most seminal finding is that parents are \nnot correct in reporting that three month old infants \u2018sleep though the night\u2019.  Infra-\nred and light-sensitive video recordings have shown that, like adults, infants wake \nseveral times each night 63; 64; 67. Most infants acquire the ability to resettle, but \napproximately a third disturb their parents called \u2018signallers\u2019 by Anders, Halpern & \nHua 63.  As noted above, it is this waking and signalling, rather than inadequate \nsleeping, which is the core feature of \u2018infant sleeping problems\u2019 complained of by \nparents.  It is worth noting the methodological implications of this evidence, since \nobjective methods, rather than parent reports, are required to measure infant sleeping \nbehaviour accurately.\nAs with adults, it is likely that both endogenous and exogenous factors influence how \nthis early process of sleep-waking consolidation takes place.  Since waking prior to \nthree months of age is thought to reflect the need for frequent feeding, nutritional \nprocesses are probably involved.  For instance, infants\u2019 stomachs may need to be \nlarge enough to contain sufficient milk before they can sustain a long period without \nfeeding, which may explain why heavier babies at birth sleep through the night at a \nyounger age 68.  Wright 69 has found that the amount of breast-milk taken at each feed \nis similar from birth to four weeks of age, but typical infants show a diurnal pattern by \neight weeks, taking the largest feed at the beginning of each day, possibly in response \n13\nto night-time deprivation.  By four to six months, the largest feed occurs at the end of \nthe day, suggesting that infants have adapted to anticipate the coming fast 69.  The \nimplication is that learning influences behavioural organisation after the first few \npostnatal weeks.  \nThe belief that feeding activities contribute to sleep-waking is supported by the \nconsistent evidence that bottle-fed infants remain settled for sustained periods at \nnight, and stop having a feed between midnight and 6am, at an earlier age than breast-\nfed infants 70; 71; 69;26.  Although this is sometimes attributed to differences in the \nconstituents of the two milk types, particularly by parents 69 it is not clear that this is \nthe case.  Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that exogenous factors associated \nwith feeding may be more important sources of sleep-waking organisation than milk \nconstituents.  First, two randomised controlled trials have shown that breast-fed \ninfants whose parents adopt structured \u2018behavioural\u2019 methods of care are more likely \nthan other infants to remain settled at night by 12 weeks of age 72, 73.  The second of \nthese studies also found that the behavioural approach was particularly effective in \npromoting settled night-time behaviour at 12 weeks among infants who had a large \nnumber of breast-feeds (>11 per 24 hours) in the first postnatal week.   Second, there \nis evidence that co-sleeping through the night (but not for short periods) is associated \nwith persistent night waking 68; 74; 26.   In keeping with this, although both Proximal \ncare and Copenhagen babies were breast-fed more often than London babies in the \ncross-cultural study described above, Proximal care babies (who typically co-slept \nwith parents throughout the night), were more likely to wake their parents at night at \n12 weeks of age72, 73.  \n14\nIn summary, these studies provide robust, convergent evidence that exogenous \nenvironmental factors contained in parenting are important sources of individual \ndifferences in infant night-time waking and \u2018signalling\u2019 behaviour by 12 weeks of \nage.  Unfortunately, we do not yet know which factors are functionally important, \nwhile at least five possibilities exist.  First, McKenna and colleagues found that bed-\nsharing mothers and infants aroused more frequently (usually as a result of the other\u2019s \nmovement or sound), and spent significantly more time in lighter stages of sleep \n(Stage 1 and Stage 2), and less time in deeper stages of sleep (Stage 3 or 4), compared \nto infants sleeping alone 75. The implication is that co-sleeping might cause infants to \nwake more often.  Second, the proximity of co-sleeping infants and parents may lead \nparents to detect infant vocal and other cues more readily.  Indeed, there is evidence \nthat waking infants often spend time making low noises before a full cry 76. Third, the \nbehavioural approach to care described above asks parents to maximise day:night \ndifferences in light: darkness, as well as in social stimulation and play.  It may be that \nthese environmental cues help infants to learn to set up a circadian sleep-waking \norganisation, as happens with adults.  Fourth, settling infants while awake may be \nimportant, since this may enable them to re-settle autonomously on waking, while \ninfants who fall asleep in their parents\u2019 arms may require this for re-settling77; 64; 74. \nSettling babies while awake is one of the elements of the behavioural approach found \nto reduce night waking and crying described above.  Fifth, co-sleeping may facilitate \nimmediate feeding when babies wake, rewarding the waking, whereas separate \nsleeping arrangements may delay feeding.  Burnham et al 78 found that delayed \nparental response to night waking at three months predicted autonomous re-settling at \n12 months. Delaying feeding for a few moments to break the bond between waking \nand feeding is a further element of the behavioural approach described above. \n15\nThese five potential mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and several may be \ninvolved. At least three of them predicate learning and the importance of learning for \nthe development of settled night-time behaviour is supported by evidence that \nbehavioural methods, which ignore waking and reward settled behaviour, provide the \nmost effective treatments for sleeping problems at older ages 79; 24. Although further \nresearch into the relative importance of these mechanisms is needed, the existing \nevidence-base is sufficient to guide clinical practice and will be revisited in Section 6. \n \nAs well as parenting practices, it is likely that endogenous factors contribute to some \n3-6 month old infants\u2019 night waking.  At older ages, 1-3 % of children are thought to \nhave sleep problems due to organic parasomnias and \u2018bio-maturational disorders\u2019, \ncompared with a prevalence of 15-35% of \u2018psychosocial cases\u2019 80.  It is reasonable to \nexpect that a variety of bio-maturational factors will contribute to night waking in \nearly infancy, while a smaller group will have serious organic disturbances.  Burnham \net al 78 found that high levels of Quiet Sleep at birth predicted which infants resettled \nat night at 12 months of age, suggesting that infant maturational characteristics play a \npart.  However, there is currently no evidence-base for distinguishing such cases or \ninfants with organic disturbances.  The implication is to point to the need for fine-\ngrained, longitudinal research.  However, since behavioural methods are the preferred \ntreatment even for neuro-developmental cases 81, here too clinical practice need not \nwait upon more accurate data.   \n \n5. Crying, Sleeping and Other Problems in Infants Over Three Months of Age\n16\nBeyond three months of age, there is growing evidence of a third and at least partly \ndistinct group of infants with multiple disturbances, rather than crying or sleeping \nproblems alone.   For example, von Kries et al 21 found that infants over six months \nof age who cried a lot were 6.6 times more likely than other infants to have sleeping \nproblems and 8.9 times more likely to eating difficulties, according to parental \nreports.  These infants also have far poorer outcomes than those who cry a lot or \nwake at night alone.82;6; 7. Wolke et al. 7 found a greatly raised prevalence of \npervasive hyperactivity problems at school-age, compared to case-control children, in \nsuch cases.  Similarly, Rao et al.6 found that prolonged crying after three months of \nage (but not before three months), predicted hyperactivity, cognitive deficits, poor \nfine- motor abilities and disciplinary problems when the children reached five years \nof age. Other studies have found a high rate of emotional and behavioural problems \nwhere crying or sleeping problems persist 26; 82. The persistence, nature and severity \nof these problems suggest that organic disturbances may play a part in some of these \ncases, a speculation which is supported by Kalliom\u00e4ki et al\u2019s 29 finding that crying \nbeyond 12 weeks characterised atopic cases.  However, many of these infants\u2019 \nparents also have vulnerabilities, including a high rate of marital discord and \nmaternal depression 82, which themselves are known to predict child problems at \nolder ages 26;83.  \nAt present, we have inadequate evidence about the prevalence of these chronic cases \nand the important question of whether their problems develop out of pre-existing \ncrying or sleeping problems, or have a distinct aetiology.  A longitudinal study of 547 \nCanadian infants from birth to six months of age 84 provides some information. Using \na definition of three or more hours of fuss and crying per 24 hours to define \n17\nprolonged crying, this study found a prevalence at six and 12 weeks, respectively, of \n24% and 6.4%.  About half the infants who cried a lot at 12 weeks had continued to \ndo so since six weeks, while in 3% of infants the onset of prolonged crying did not \noccur until 12 weeks of age or later.  These figures need to be qualified by the \nmethodological limitations of this study, including the use of retrospective reports in \nan unspecified proportion of cases, while it is not known how many of the infants had \nmultiple problems.  With these provisos, the findings suggest that half of infants with \nprolonged crying at 12 weeks have an earlier onset, while in half \u2013 perhaps 3% of \ninfants \u2013 the onset occurs at or after 12 weeks of age. Rao et al\u2019s 6 prospective study \nof problem criers found continuity beyond 12 weeks in 25% of cases.\nFew intervention studies have specifically targeted this group.  An exception is \nPapou\u0161ek et al\u2019s 82 Munich study, where parents received an intervention programme \nfocusing on sensitive management of infant behaviour. Although 93% of parents and \ninfants were rated \u2018fully or partially improved\u2019 at the end of the programme by a \npsychologist and paediatrician, at a follow-up assessment at 30 months of age the \nprogramme infants were reported by parents to be highly difficult, hard to control and \nto have high rates of sleeping and behaviour problems.  \nIn summary, many of the infants who come to clinical attention because of prolonged \ncrying, sleeping and other problems after three months of age are reported by parents \nto have multiple problems, while some families of such infants face multiple psycho-\nsocial adversities.  These combined features are associated with more serious and \nlong-term disturbances than are typical where infants have crying or sleeping \nproblems alone.  Although we do not have accurate prevalence figures, the data \n18\nsuggest that about 50% of such infants start their problems earlier, while others have \ntheir onset at, or after, three months of age, suggesting distinct etiological pathways. \nThe findings implicate parenting as a contributing factor in some cases and this is \nconsistent with our understanding of the importance of parenting as a scaffold for \nolder infants\u2019 development 83 and the evidence that parenting programmes can \nimprove young children\u2019s behaviour85.  However, the current data neither distinguish \nthe cases where this is applicable nor indicate the sort of interventions likely to be \nmost effective in these cases.  Rather, the findings highlight the paucity of evidence \nabout this group of infants and the need to prioritise these cases for research and \nclinical work.  \n6. Implications for Professionals: Helping Parents to Manage Infant Crying and \nSleeping.   \nThere is a longstanding debate in the research and popular literatures about the merits \nof forms of parenting which respond to babies\u2019 perceived needs, for example by \nbreast-feeding on demand and co-sleeping (often called \u2018infant-demand\u2019 or \u2018infant-\nled\u2019 care), and forms of parenting which seek to impose routines and constraints upon \nbabies\u2019 behaviour (\u2018routine- based\u2019, \u2018scheduled\u2019 or \u2018structured\u2019 care, Ford 200286.. \nThe evidence reviewed here goes some way towards explaining why this debate has \npersisted, since it indicates that neither of these parenting approaches is better overall; \nrather they are associated with different benefits and costs.  The clearest evidence, \nemerging both from comparative studies and randomised controlled trials, is that \nstructured care (as exemplified by parents following behavioural programmes) leads \ninfants to develop the ability to remain settled at night by 12 weeks of age. The best \navailable evidence, not yet subjected to randomised trials, indicates that \u2018infant-\n19\ndemand\u2019 care, exemplified by the frequent breast-feeding and high levels of \nresponsiveness, holding and co-sleeping involved in Proximal care, leads to low \namounts of overall fussing and crying in the first two months of age, but to waking \nand crying at night which continues at and beyond three months of age.\nThese findings and the lack of evidence that most infants who cry a lot in the first two \nmonths, or wake and cry at night at three months, are unwell or likely to have long-\nterm problems, are empowering for parents.  Rather than doing what\u2019s medically \n\u2018best\u2019, the findings imply that parents can make informed choices.  The aim below \nwill be to translate the evidence into guidance which healthcare professionals can give \nto parents to help them make such choices during early infancy. \n1. Since there is no evidence that the bouts of unsoothable crying which occur in 1-3 \nmonth babies are affected by parenting, parents can be prepared for these and \nreassured that they are not their fault.  Anticipatory guidance can also emphasize \nthat it is not currently possible to predict which particular baby will cry a lot. \nVariables such as gender, birth-order and method of feeding are poor predictors \nand there are currently no reliable tests for predicting food intolerance.  It follows \nthat parents will need to choose the care approach which is most compatible with \ntheir goals and resources and make adjustments as necessary with experience.  \n2. The available evidence indicates that the main benefit of infant-demand care lies \nin the early weeks, when both Proximal and Copenhagen forms of care are \nassociated with 33% less overall fuss\/crying than typically occurs among babies \nwho receive conventional London parenting. Where parents consider this is a \n20\ndesirable goal, the choice between these two approaches involves balancing a \nnumber of benefits and costs, some of which are inadequately understood.  Sch\u00f6n \n& Silv\u00e9n 87, for instance, argue that Proximal care methods have overall benefits, \nincluding shorter and less intense crying periods.  Conceivably, co-sleeping \ninfants may not reach a full cry when they wake at night-time for feeding, so that \ntheir parents are not disturbed by feeding as much as non-co-sleeping parents 88. \nUnfortunately, there is a dearth of systematic research to confirm these benefits, or \nidentify other costs.  For example, there is some evidence that conflicts may \nsometimes arise at later ages when parents wish to stop co-sleeping54, but the \nconditions under which this does and does not happen are unknown.  \nSome parents may find Proximal care difficult to accomplish within the resources \nand constraints imposed by contemporary Western society.  Notably, for instance, \njust 29% of Proximal care mothers in the cross-cultural study described above \nwere employed before their babies\u2019 births, compared with 57% of London and \n64% of Copenhagen mothers.   Parents will also need to keep in mind that \ncontinuation, particularly, of co-sleeping throughout the night to a later age has \nbeen repeatedly linked to continued infant night-waking.  Anticipatory guidance \nshould also alert them to the evidence about co-sleeping and Sudden Infant Death \nSyndrome, (see point 4 below).  \nWhere parents find Proximal care beyond their resources, a noteworthy finding in \nthe cross-cultural study described above was that Copenhagen parents\u2019 care was \nas effective as Proximal care in minimising early crying and as effective as \nLondon care in enabling infants to remain settled at night by 12 weeks of age. \n21\nThere is no evidence that co-sleeping for short periods during the night, as \npracticed by Copenhagen parents, increases night waking problems.  Many \nparents may wish to follow Copenhagen parents\u2019 approach as a workable \ncompromise between Proximal and conventional Western care and health \nprofessionals may wish to bring it to their attention.  Unlike Proximal care, it does \nnot involve such continuous day-time carrying or night-time co-sleeping.  \n3. Where parents wish to prevent night waking and signalling after 12 weeks, there is \nstrong evidence that introduction of structured parenting based on behavioural \nprinciples from about six weeks of age is likely to help.  A noteworthy finding is \nthat no benefits of this approach were apparent before six weeks of age. \nImportant advantages are that this approach is effective with breast-fed infants and \nthat, unlike \u2018extinction\u2019 and \u2018controlled crying\u2019 methods used to treat infant \nsleeping problems after they have arisen, does not involve leaving babies to cry. \nThe elements of this approach are described more fully in the original \npublications72; 73, but in essence it comprises just three steps. First, parents are \nadvised to maximise the difference between day and night-time environments, by \nminimising light and social interaction at night.  Second, they are asked to settle a \nbaby judged to be sleepy in a cot or similar place, and to avoid feeding or \ncuddling to sleep, at night-time.  Third, once the baby is at least three weeks old, \nhealthy and putting on weight normally, they can begin to delay feeding when \nbaby wakes at night, in order to dissociate waking from feeding. This is done \ngradually, using nappy changing or handling to introduce a delay, and does not \ninvolve leaving babies to cry.   \n22\n4. Another consideration affecting parental choices is the controversy about the \nrelationship between co-sleeping and infant Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \n(SIDS).  Experts are divided in their interpretation of this evidence, with some \nconcluding that co-sleeping increases the risk of SIDS, even where parents do not \nshow other risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption 89; 90 and others \nconcluding that co-sleeping helps to keep infants in lighter stages of sleep and \nconsequently may protect against SIDS 75.  \nClearly, most parents will wish to prioritise a form of care which minimises the \nrisk of SIDS over care which minimises sleeping problems.  However, there is no \ndirect evidence to support a protective role for co-sleeping, while there is \nsystematic, albeit inconclusive, evidence that co-sleeping increases the risk of \nSIDS89; 90, 91.  The website for the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths \n(http:\/\/www.fsid.org.uk\/babycare.html accessed 1pm 09\/02\/2007) currently \nrecommends that the safest place for a baby to sleep is in a cot in the parents\u2019 \nbedroom for the first six months, and recommends against sharing a bed with a \nbaby, as does the American Academy of Pediatrics92.  On this basis, and providing \ninfants settled in cots are placed on their backs or sides and carefully monitored, \nthere is no reason to expect that using cots and a structured approach to infant \nsleeping after about six weeks of age will increase the likelihood of SIDS.\n5. Where parents report an established infant crying or sleeping problem, parental \ncomplaint, rather than infant behaviour, is the presenting phenomenon. Such \ncomplaints involve a subjective judgement, while parents vary in their knowledge \nand tolerance.  Measurements which accurately assess infant behaviour are an \n23\nessential first step in understanding what the problem is.  Instruments for \nmeasuring infant sleeping and crying have been developed for research and can be \nadapted for routine health service practice.  Behaviour diaries, such as the Baby\u2019s \nDay Diary, 45 are the most accurate method.  Where parents cannot keep them, \nsummary questionnaires such as the Crying Patterns Questionnaire 93 can be used. \nQuestionnaire and diary methods exist for measuring infant sleeping 94; 95; 81. \nThere is a need for cost-effectiveness research, which evaluates the use of these \nprocedures under routine health-care service conditions.\n6. Because some parents are particularly vulnerable to infant crying and night \nwaking, collection of information to identify maternal depression, social supports, \nsingle parenthood, and other sources of parental vulnerability should be a core \npart of the primary workup, so that services can be targeted towards need.  \n7. In about 1 in 10 cases, persistent crying in 1-3 month old infants reflects an \norganic disturbance.   Health services need effective means of identifying and \ntreating these special cases.  Gormally 18 and Treem 96, two paediatric members of \nan expert panel on infant crying and colic, recommended the following inclusion \nand exclusion criteria for identifying organic cases:\n\u2022 high pitched\/abnormal sounding cry;\n\u2022 lack of a diurnal rhythm;\n\u2022 presence of frequent regurgitations, vomiting, diarrhoea, blood in \nstools, weight loss or failure to thrive;\n\u2022 positive family history of migraine, asthma, atopy, eczema;\n\u2022 maternal drug ingestion;\n24\n\u2022 positive physical exam (including eyes, palpation of large bones, \nneurological, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular assessment); \n\u2022 persistence past four months of age.\nHeine et al 97, too, recommend that gastroesopageal reflux should be diagnosed \nonly in cases with feeding difficulties and frequent regurgitation (>5times daily). \nWhere organic disturbance is suspected, parents again need to make choices about \nthe benefits and costs of alternative actions.  An important consideration is that \nthere are no reliable tests available to confirm atopic or gastroesopageal cases 28;29. \nConsequently, confirmation requires dietary manipulations, which carry their own \ninconvenience and cost.  Wolke 44, points to the advantages of breast-feeding and \nnotes that manipulations of breast-feeding mother\u2019 diets in order to change their \nmilk constituents are difficult to achieve in practice.  Heine 28 identifies the need \nfor expert supervision where breast-feeding mothers\u2019 diets are restricted, so that \nthis approach may be inappropriate where expertise is lacking.  Further, as noted \nabove, there is little evidence that low-allergen diets for breast-feeding mothers \nproduce changes in infant behaviour which resolve the crying problem so far as \nparents are concerned.  Where babies are bottle-fed formula feeds, there is clearer, \nbut not universally accepted, evidence that changes to a hypo-allergenic formula \ncan reduce crying in some cases 28.  Parents who favour this option will need \nexpert support.  \n8. Where no organic disturbances are found, the available evidence provides no basis \nfor advising parents in general that changes in their care are likely to resolve \n25\ncrying problems in 1-3 month old infants once they have arisen.  This is \nparticularly true of the prolonged, unsoothable crying bouts which seem to be \ncentral to parents\u2019 concerns in early infancy.  Instead, once organic disturbance is \nconsidered and the infant\u2019s healthy growth and development is confirmed, the \nfocus of intervention should be on containing the crying and providing parents \nwith information and support.  Important elements advocated by an expert group98 \nare: \n\u2022 Examining the notion that crying means that there is something \u2018wrong\u2019 with a \nbaby of this age.  Introducing alternatives \u2013 e.g. that it signals a reactive or \nvigorous baby. \n\u2022 Viewing the first three months of infancy as a developmental transition, which all \nbabies go through more or less smoothly.\n\u2022 Reassuring parents that it is normal to find crying aversive and discussing the \ndangers of \u2018shaken baby syndrome\u2019.\n\u2022 Discussing ways of containing\/minimising the crying, and highlighting positive \nfeatures of the baby.\n\u2022 Considering the availability of supports and the development of coping strategies \nwhich allow individual parents to take time out and \u2018recharge their batteries\u2019.\n\u2022 Empowering parents and reframing the first three months as a challenge which \nthey can overcome, with positive consequences for themselves and their \nrelationships with their babies.\n\u2022 Continuing to monitor infant and parents.\n9. Compared with infants who have solely crying or sleeping problems, there is \nconsistent evidence of poor long-term outcomes in cases with multiple behaviour \n26\ndisturbances beyond 12 weeks of age.  Unfortunately, the current data neither \ndistinguish the cases where organic or social-environmental explanations are most \napplicable nor indicate the sort of interventions likely to be most effective in these \ncases.  Since there is evidence that interventions which target parenting are \neffective from about six months of age through the pre-school period 99; 85 \nprogrammes of this kind may be considered as an important part of healthcare \nservices. However, the chief implication of the findings in this area at present is to \nhighlight the paucity of evidence about this group of infants and to identify them \nand their families as a priority for health services and research.\nReferences\n27\n"}
