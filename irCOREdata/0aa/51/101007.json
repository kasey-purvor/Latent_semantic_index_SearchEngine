Introduction\nSuppose that f : X \u2192 X is a discrete dynamical system with ergodic invariant measure \u00b5.\nIf \u03c6,\u03c8 : X \u2192 R lie in L2(X), we define the correlation function\n\u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8(n) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b\nX\n\u03c6(\u03c8 \u25e6 f n) d\u00b5 \u2212\n\u222b\nX\n\u03c6 d\u00b5\n\u222b\nX\n\u03c8 d\u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223.\nThe dynamical system is mixing if \u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8(n) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e for all \u03c6,\u03c8 \u2208 L2(X).\nFor certain classes of dynamical systems and sufficiently regular observations \u03c6,\u03c8 , it is\npossible to estimate the speed at which \u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8 (n) \u2192 0. For Axiom A diffeomorphisms,\nit is known that the correlation function decays exponentially for Ho\u00a8lder observations\n(see, for example, [3, 19, 20]).\nThe early proofs in the uniformly hyperbolic case revolve around quasicompactness\nof a certain transfer operator. This method also applies to certain hyperbolic systems\nwith singularities and to certain non-uniformly hyperbolic situations. Such systems can\noften be modelled by the tower construction of Young [24] and then exponential return\nasymptotics guarantee the existence of a \u2018physical\u2019 measure \u00b5 and exponential decay of\ncorrelations.\nSeveral methods have been developed to deal with the case where the rate of decay\nof correlations are slower than exponential. (For a recent survey, see Baladi [2].)\nThese methods include Birkhoff cones [5, 14, 23] and probabilistic coupling [25].\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1720 H. Bruin et al\nIn particular, Young towers with subexponential return asymptotics have subexponential\n(stretched exponential or polynomial) decay of correlations [25]. Sarig [21] introduced\noperator renewal sequences to obtain lower bounds for decay of correlations and\nthis method was refined by Goue\u00a8zel [8]. In particular, the results of [8, 21] show\nthat the subexponential decay rates of Young [25] are optimal. (See also [12,\nTheorem 4.3].)\nIn this paper, we are interested in group extensions X \u00d7 G where G is a compact\nconnected Lie group with Haar measure \u03bd and f : X \u2192 X is a dynamical system of\nthe type described above with ergodic measure \u00b5. Given a Ho\u00a8lder cocycle h : X \u2192 G, we\ndefine the G-extension fh : X \u00d7 G \u2192 X \u00d7 G by fh(x, g) = (f x, gh(x)). The product\nmeasure m = \u00b5 \u00d7 \u03bd is fh-invariant and is ergodic\/mixing under mild hypotheses on f\nand h (see [7] for the case when X is uniformly hyperbolic). We take mixing as given in\nthis paper, and direct our attention to the rate of mixing. For general Ho\u00a8lder observations\n\u03c6,\u03c8 : X \u00d7 G \u2192 R, existing results are restricted to the case when X is uniformly\nhyperbolic and either G is semi-simple or X is infranil Anosov, see Dolgopyat [4].\nNicol et al [18] introduced a class of equivariant observations \u03c6 : X \u00d7 G \u2192 Rd of the\nform \u03c6(x, g) = g \u00b7 v(x) where Rd is a representation of G and v : X \u2192 Rd . The statistics\nof such observations arise naturally in dynamical systems with Euclidean symmetry [18].\nThe correlation function \u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8 (n) is now defined to be\n\u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8 (n) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b\nX\u00d7G\n\u03c6(\u03c8T \u25e6 f nh ) dm \u2212\n\u222b\nX\u00d7G\n\u03c6 dm\n\u222b\nX\u00d7G\n\u03c8T dm\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223.\nWe view elements of Rd as column vectors, and so \u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8 (n) takes values in the space of\nd \u00d7 d matrices.\nResults on exponential decay of correlations for equivariant observations on compact\ngroup extensions were obtained by [6] in the case when X is uniformly hyperbolic.\nThis was extended in [16] to include more general situations where the transfer operator is\nquasicompact for the X dynamics.\nAn important open problem is to obtain results on subexponential decay of correlations\nfor sufficiently regular observations of compact group extensions. Previously, there\nwere no such results even for equivariant observations. In this paper, we deduce\nsubexponential decay results for equivariant observations on X \u00d7 G in certain situations\nwhere subexponential decay can be proved on X. The technique of proof is perhaps\nunexpected. The Hilbert cones and probabilistic coupling methods mentioned above fail\nfor equivariant observations\u2014Hilbert cones use the positivity of the transfer operator;\nin coupling the observation is viewed as the density for a probability measure; neither\nmakes sense here. Instead we use the operator renewal sequence method of Sarig [21]\nand Goue\u00a8zel [8]. In the non-equivariant context, the renewal method gives optimal decay\nrates for Ho\u00a8lder observations supported on a certain subset of X, see [8, 21]. This can\nbe used to obtain decay rates for general Ho\u00a8lder observations as was pointed out in\nGoue\u00a8zel [10], see also [9]. In fact, the method is much easier to apply in our context\nthan in the non-equivariant situation, but we do not obtain lower bounds. (These two\nstatements are related since the leading term in [8, 21] vanishes in the equivariant\ncase.)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\nGroup extensions of non-uniformly expanding systems 1721\n1.1. Statement of the main result. Let (X, d) be a separable bounded metric space with\nBorel probability measure \u03b7 and let f : X \u2192 X be a non-singular transformation for\nwhich \u03b7 is ergodic. Let Y \u2282 X be a measurable subset with \u03b7(Y ) > 0. We suppose that\nthere is an at most countable measurable partition {Yj } with \u03b7(Yj ) > 0, and that there exist\nintegers rj \u2265 1, and constants \u03bb > 1; C,D > 0 and \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) such that for all j :\n(1) f rj : Yj \u2192 Y is a (measure-theoretic) isomorphism;\n(2) d(f rj x, f rj y) \u2265 \u03bbd(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 Yj ;\n(3) d(f kx, f ky) \u2264 Cd(f rj x, f rj y) for all x, y \u2208 Yj , k < rj ;\n(4) gj = d(\u03b7|Yj \u25e6 (f rj )\u22121)\/d\u03b7|Y satisfies |loggj (x) \u2212 log gj (y)| \u2264 Dd(x, y)\u03b3 for\nalmost all x, y \u2208 Y ;\n(5) \u2211j rj \u03b7(Yj ) < \u221e.\nWe say that a dynamical system f satisfying (1)\u2013(5) is non-uniformly expanding.\nWe define the return time function r : Y \u2192 N by r|Yj \u2261 rj . Condition (5) says that\u222b\nY\nr d\u03b7 < \u221e. The corresponding return map f Y : Y \u2192 Y is given by f Y (y) = f r(y)(y).\nBy condition (2), f Y is uniformly expanding. It can be shown (see \u00a75.1) that there is a\nunique invariant probability measure \u00b5 on X that is equivalent to \u03b7.\nRemark 1.1. We note that the return times r(y) need not be first returns and so f Y need\nnot be the first return map to Y . In order to apply renewal theory, a preliminary step is to\nmodel f : X \u2192 X by a Young tower F : \b \u2192 \b built over a base \b0 \u2282 \b that is a copy\nof Y . The tower map F is Markov and the first return map for \b0 is precisely the uniformly\nexpanding map f Y : Y \u2192 Y . Hence, renewal theory can be used to study F : \b \u2192 \b\nand thereby to study f : X \u2192 X. Throughout \u00a7\u00a73 and 4, the return times are first return\ntimes. The Young tower model appears in \u00a75.\nLet G be a compact connected Lie group with Haar measure \u03bd. Given a measurable\ncocycle h : X \u2192 G, we define the G-extension fh : X \u00d7 G \u2192 X \u00d7 G with fh invariant\nmeasure m = \u00b5 \u00d7 \u03bd. Forward iterates are given for n \u2265 1 by\nf nh (x, g) = (f nx, ghn(x)) where hn(x) = h(x)h(f x) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7h(f n\u22121x).\nIn particular, we obtain the return map on Y \u00d7G given by (y, g) \n\u2192 (f Y y, ghY (y)) where\nhY : Y \u2192 G is defined to be hY (y) = hr(y)(y).\nNow let Rd be an orthogonal representation of G (so G can be viewed as a closed\nsubgroup of the d \u00d7 d orthogonal matrices). Let | \u00b7 | denote a choice of norm on Rd .\nWe say that \u03c6 : X \u00d7 G \u2192 Rd is an equivariant observation if \u03c6(x, g) = g \u00b7 v(x) where\nv : X \u2192 Rd . Note that \u03c6 \u2208 L\u221e(X \u00d7 G) if and only if v \u2208 L\u221e(X) in which case\n|\u03c6|\u221e = |v|\u221e. If v : X \u2192 Rd is \u03b3 -Ho\u00a8lder, then we say that \u03c6 is Ho\u00a8lder and we define\n\u2016\u03c6\u2016\u03b3 = |v|\u221e + |v|\u03b3 where |v|\u03b3 = supx \f=y |v(x) \u2212 v(y)|\/d(x, y)\u03b3 .\nTHEOREM 1.2. Let fh : X\u00d7G \u2192 X\u00d7G be a mixing compact group extension of a non-\nuniformly expanding map as above, where h : X \u2192 G is a Ho\u00a8lder cocycle. Assume that\n\u00b5(y \u2208 Y : r(y) \u2265 n) = O(n\u2212(\u03b2+1)),\nfor some \u03b2 > 1. Let G act orthogonally on Rd . Then there exists a constant C > 0 such\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1722 H. Bruin et al\nthat for all equivariant observations \u03c6,\u03c8 : X \u00d7 G \u2192 Rd with \u03c6 Ho\u00a8lder and \u03c8 \u2208 L\u221e,\n\u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8 (n) \u2264 C\u2016\u03c6\u2016\u03b3 |\u03c8|\u221en\u2212\u03b2.\nSimilar results hold for more general decay rates, including stretched exponential\n(see \u00a72.1).\nRemark 1.3. (a) Define Fix G = {v \u2208 Rd : gv = v for all g \u2208 G}. We can always\ndecompose Rd = Rd1 \u00d7 Rd2 where G acts trivially on Rd1 (FixG = Rd1 ) and fixed-\npoint freely on Rd2 (FixG = {0}). When G acts trivially, we are in the situation studied\nby [8, 21] so we focus on the case Fix G = {0}.\n(b) Suppose that FixG = {0} and that \u03c6 and \u03c8 are supported in Y \u00d7G. Then we obtain\nthe improved estimate \u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8(n) \u2264 C\u2016\u03c6\u2016\u03b3 |\u03c8|\u221en\u2212(\u03b2+1) if the cocycle h is either (i) locally\nconstant (more precisely, h is constant on f \n(Yj ) for each j \u2265 1 and 0 \u2264 \n \u2264 rj \u2212 1),\nor (ii) supported in Y . See Remark 5.4.\nIt is clear that the results in this paper hold for more general classes of piecewise\nHo\u00a8lder observations\/cocycles (possibly with weaker decay results). For ease of exposition,\nwe consider primarily the uniformly Ho\u00a8lder case.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, we prove a simplified special\ncase of the renewal theorem of [8, 21] which suffices for our purposes. In \u00a73, we introduce\noperator renewal sequences in the context of group extensions. In \u00a74, we prove a version\nof Theorem 1.2 in the context of Markov maps with a Gibbs\u2013Markov first return map\nf Y : Y \u2192 Y , for Ho\u00a8lder observations supported in Y \u00d7 G. In \u00a75, we prove Theorem 1.2.\nThis is done by reducing to the case of a Young tower [25] which is itself a special case\nof a Markov map with a Gibbs\u2013Markov first return map. We also consider in \u00a75 compact\ngroup extensions of systems that are non-uniformly hyperbolic in the sense of Young [24].\n2. A simplified renewal theorem\nLet Hom(B) denote the space of bounded linear operators on a Banach space B. Let Rn \u2208\nHom(B). We assume that\n\u221e\u2211\nj=n\n\u2016Rj\u2016 = O(n\u2212\u03b2) where \u03b2 \u2265 0. (H1)\nSet R(\u03c9) = \u2211\u221en=1 Rnein\u03c9. It follows from (H1) that R : S1 \u2192 Hom(B) is a well-defined\nmap. Next, we assume that\nThe spectrum of R(\u03c9) does not contain 1 for all \u03c9 \u2208 S1. (H2)\nDefine T (\u03c9) = (I \u2212 R(\u03c9))\u22121. Hypothesis (H2) guarantees that T : S1 \u2192 Hom(B) is\nwell-defined.\nTHEOREM 2.1. Assume that (H1) and (H2) are valid with \u03b2 > 0 not an integer. Then the\nFourier coefficients Tn of T satisfy \u2016Tn\u2016 = O(|n|\u2212\u03b2).\nBy definition, the negative Fourier coefficients of R(\u03c9) vanish, but this property need\nnot hold for T . If it does, then a sharper result is possible.\nTn = 0 for n \u2264 \u22121.

Assume that (H1)\u2013(H3) are valid with \u03b2 > 0 and \u03b2 \f= 1. Then the\nFourier coefficients Tn of T satisfy \u2016Tn\u2016 = O(n\u2212\u03b2).\nProof. By Theorem 2.1, it remains to consider the cases \u03b2 \u2208 {2, 3, . . .}. In particular, the\nFourier coefficients \u2016Tn\u2016 are summable. Now apply [8, Lemma 4.5]. \u0001\nRemark 2.3. (1) Much of the difficulty, and hence depth, of the work in [8, 21] stems\nfrom the fact that 1 is automatically an eigenvalue of R(0) in their context. Hence (H2) is\nviolated, necessitating a combination of complex analytic techniques and Fourier analysis.\nIn our work, Fourier analysis alone suffices.\n(2) As the proof of Corollary 2.2 shows, when (H3) holds it suffices to show that\nTheorem 2.1 holds for \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1) and that \u2016Tn\u2016 is summable for \u03b2 > 1. For completeness,\nan independent proof of Theorem 2.1 is given in \u00a72.2. In addition, the estimates in\nTheorem 2.1 are explicit (this is clear in the proof) which may be of use for estimating\nmixing times (though we do not pursue that issue here).\n2.1. Stretched exponential rates and convolutive sequences. Corollary 2.2 can be\ngeneralized significantly using ideas in the PhD thesis of Goue\u00a8zel [10, De\u00b4finition 2.2.10].\nAdapting the definitions there, we say that a sequence of positive numbers un > 0 is\nconvolutive if\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 un < \u221e and there exists a constant C > 0 such that:\n(i) (u \u2217 u)n \u2264 Cun for all n \u2265 1;\n(ii) um \u2264 Cun for all m \u2265 n;\n(iii) (1 \u2212 \f)n = O(un) for all \f > 0;\n(iv) for all \f > 0; there exists N \u2265 1 such that the sequence vn = 1n\u2265Nun satisfies\n(v \u2217 v)n \u2264 \fun for all n \u2265 1.\nFor un convolutive, it follows from Goue\u00a8zel [10] that if\n\u2211\u221e\nj=n \u2016Rj\u2016 = O(un) and (H2)\nand (H3) are valid, then \u2016Tn\u2016 = O(un).\nIt is easily verified that un = n\u2212\u03b2 is convolutive for \u03b2 > 1, so we recover Corollary 2.2\nin this case. Also, stretched exponential sequences un = \u03c4n\u03b3 with \u03c4, \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) are\nconvolutive, so we obtain a stretched exponential version of Corollary 2.2.\nThe above definition of convolutive sequence is simpler than in [10], so it is worth\nmentioning where the various conditions are used. The method in [10] is to apply a\ngeneralized version of the Wiener lemma from harmonic analysis (if f \u2208 L1(S1,C)\nis non-vanishing and has summable Fourier coefficients, then f\u22121 has summable\nFourier coefficients) [13, p. 202]. Conditions (i) and (ii) guarantee the existence of a\nsuitable Banach algebra. Conditions (iii) and (iv) ensure that the Wiener lemma holds\nin this Banach algebra. The remaining conditions in [10] are not required here due to the\nsimplification mentioned in Remark 2.3(1).\n2.2. Proof of Theorem 2.1. In the remainder of this section, we prove Theorem 2.1.\nThroughout, if \u03b2 \u2265 0 then we write \u03b2 = k + \u03b1 where k = [\u03b2] and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1).\nLEMMA 2.4.

Then N\u2212\u03b1 \u2264 |\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92|\u03b1 and\nN |\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92| \u2264 1 + 2\u03c0 so that \u2016R(\u03c91)\u2212R(\u03c92)\u2016 \u2264 C(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u22121(3 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b1)|\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92|\u03b1 ,\nas required.\nNext suppose that \u03b2 = k + \u03b1 \u2265 1. Repeatedly differentiating the power series\nfor R yields R(k)(\u03c9) = \u2211\u221en=1 nkRnein\u03c9. Let En = \u2211j\u2265n jk\u2016Rj\u2016. We claim that\nEn = O(n\u2212\u03b1). It follows that R(k) is C\u03b1 as required.\nIt remains to prove the claim. We have Sn =\u2211j\u2265n \u2016Rj\u2016 \u2264 Cn\u2212(k+\u03b1). Compute that\nEn =\n\u2211\nj\u2265n\njk\u2016Rj\u2016 =\n\u2211\nj\u2265n\njk(Sj \u2212 Sj+1) = nkSn +\n\u2211\nj\u2265n+1\n(jk \u2212 (j \u2212 1)k)Sj .\nUsing the identity xk \u2212 yk = (x \u2212 y)(xk\u22121 + xk\u22122y + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + yk\u22121), we see that\njk \u2212 (j \u2212 1)k \u2264 kjk\u22121. Hence En \u2264 Cn\u2212\u03b1 + Ck\u2211j\u2265n+1 j\u2212(\u03b1+1) \u2264 C(1 + k\/\u03b1)n\u2212\u03b1 . \u0001\nLEMMA 2.5. Suppose that T : S1 \u2192 Hom(B) is C\u03b2 where \u03b2 \u2265 0 and let Tn \u2208 Hom(B)\ndenote the Fourier coefficients of T . Then \u2016Tn\u2016 = O(n\u2212\u03b2).\nProof. First suppose that \u03b2 = \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1). The estimate is a standard result for B = C\n(see [13, p. 25]) which easily generalizes as in Sarig [21].\nNext suppose that \u03b2 = k + \u03b1 \u2265 1. Integrating by parts k times yields\nTn = 12\u03c0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nT (k)(\u03c9)\ne\u2212in\u03c9\n(in)k\nd\u03c9.\nNow En = (in)kTn are the Fourier coefficients of the C\u03b1 function T (k) and so \u2016En\u2016 =\nO(n\u2212\u03b1). Hence \u2016Tn\u2016 = O(n\u2212\u03b2) as required. \u0001\nProof of Theorem 2.1. By Lemma 2.4, R is C\u03b2 , and it follows from (H2) that T =\n(I \u2212 R)\u22121 is C\u03b2 . The result follows from Lemma 2.5. \u0001\n3. Renewal sequences for group extensions\nIn this section, we begin by recalling the formalism of inducing for discrete dynamical\nsystems in the context of compact group extensions and equivariant observations, see \u00a73.1.\nIn \u00a73.2, we introduce the operator renewal sequences Tn and Rn. In our context, these\noperators are twisted versions of the transfer operators introduced by Sarig [21].

Let Zn consist of those y \u2208 Y for which n is the least integer such that\nf ny \u2208 Y . Then we have the measurable partition Y = \u22c3n\u22651 Zn and we define the first\nreturn map (or induced map) f Y : Y \u2192 Y by setting f Y y = f ny for y \u2208 Zn.\nGiven a cocycle h : X \u2192 G with corresponding G-extension fh : X \u00d7 G \u2192 X \u00d7 G,\nwe define (as in the introduction) the induced G-extension (fh)Y\u00d7G : Y \u00d7 G \u2192 Y \u00d7 G.\nNote that (fh)Y\u00d7G = (f Y )hY where\nhY = hn = h \u00b7 h \u25e6 f \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 h \u25e6 f n\u22121 on Zn.\nWe consider equivariant observations \u03c6 : X \u00d7 G \u2192 Rd of the form \u03c6(x, g) = gv(x)\nwhere v \u2208 L1(X,Rd ).

The proof is standard for \u03c9 \f= 0 (cf. Pollicott and Parry\n[19, Proposition 6.2]), and the case \u03c9 = 0 follows as in [6]. The details are provided\nfor completeness.\nLet U : L2(Y,Cd ) \u2192 L2(Y,Cd ) denote the isometry Uv = e\u2212ir\u03c9hY v \u25e6 f Y with\nadjoint U\u2217v = R(eir\u03c9(hY )\u22121v) satisfying U\u2217U = I . It is easy to see that Uv = v is\nequivalent to U\u2217v = v (see, for example, [16, \u00a72]). Hence, it suffices to show that Uv = v\nhas no non-zero solutions in L2(Y,Cd ).\nSuppose for contradiction that v \u2208 L2(Y,Cd ) is non-zero and Uv = v.

Moreover, it is immediate that\n\u03c8 \u25e6 fh = ei\u03c9\u03c8.\nIf \u03c9 \f= 0, then this contradicts the assumption that fh is mixing. If \u03c9 = 0 then it\nfollows from ergodicity of fh that \u03c8 is constant. Writing \u03c8(x, g) = gw(x) (where\nw(y, j) = eij\u03c9v(y)), we obtain that w(x) \u2208 FixG = {0} for all x \u2208 X contradicting\nthe assumption that v is non-zero. \u0001\n4.

By a standard argument, the unit\nball in B is compact in L\u221e.

By Proposition 3.3, 1 is not an eigenvalue of R(\u03c9) : L2(Y ) \u2192 L2(Y ), and\nB \u2282 L2(Y ), so we conclude that 1 does not lie in the spectrum of R(\u03c9), establishing (H2).\nTo prove (H3), we extend R to an analytic map z \n\u2192 R(z) = \u2211n\u22651 Rnzn for z \u2208 C,\n|z| \u2264 1.

Suppose that f : X \u2192 X is a non-uniformly\nexpanding map with ergodic measure \u03b7 and uniformly expanding return map f Y : Y \u2192 Y\nas described in the introduction.

Bruin et al\n0 \u2264 \n < r(y) \u2212 1 and F(y, r(y) \u2212 1) = (f Y y, 0). Note that the return map f Y : Y \u2192 Y\nis identified with the first return map f Y : \b0 \u2192 \b0. In particular, the return times rj for\nthe map f are first return times for the map F .\nWe can write \b as the disjoint union \b =\u22c3j\u22651\u22c3rj\u22121\n=0 \bj,\n, where \bj,\n = \bj,0 \u00d7{\n}.\nThen F is Markov with respect to the partition {\bj,\n}. Also f Y is Markov with respect to\nthe partition {\bj,0}. (In the notation of \u00a74.1, {\bj,\n} plays the role of \u03b1 and {\bj,0} plays\nthe role of \u03b2.)\nAs in \u00a74.1, we define a metric d\u03b8 on \b0 in terms of the separation times under the first\nreturn map f Y . So if x, y \u2208 \bj,0 for some j , then s(x, y) is the greatest integer n \u2265 0 such\nthat (f Y )nx and (f Y )ny lie in the same partition element of \b0 and d\u03b8(x, y) = \u03b8s(x,y).\nThe separation time function and metric extend to \b as follows: if x, y lie in distinct\npartition elements, then s(x, y) = 0. If x, y \u2208 \bj,\n then write x = F\nx0, y = F\ny0 where\nx0, y0 \u2208 \bj,0 and define s(x, y) = s(x0, y0). Hence, d\u03b8 (x, y) = \u03b8s(x,y) defines a metric\non \b for any choice of \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1).\nDefine the projection \u03c0 : \b \u2192 X by \u03c0(y, \n) = f \n(y).

We note that \b satisfies the\ntechnical assumptions necessary to be a Young tower [25]: by condition (1), each partition\nelement \bj,0 is mapped by f Y onto the whole of \b0; the required distortion condition is\nimmediate by condition (4) and part (i) of the proposition. As the return time function r is\nintegrable (condition(5)), it is standard (see, for example, [25, Theorem 1]) that there is an\nF -invariant probability measure \u00b5\u2032 on \b, with \u00b5\u2032 equivalent to \u03b7\u2032. Now define \u00b5 = \u03c0\u2217\u00b5\u2032\nto obtain the required measure on X. This completes the proof of part (ii).\nPart (iii) is immediate again by part (i) and conditions (1) and (4).

It is immediate that mixing properties for\nFh\u25e6\u03c0 are inherited by fh. We have the following partial converse.\nPROPOSITION 5.2. Suppose that the group extension fh : X\u00d7G \u2192 X\u00d7G is mixing and\nthat gcd{rj , j \u2265 1} = 1. Then Fh\u25e6\u03c0 : \b \u00d7 G \u2192 \b \u00d7 G is mixing.\nSketch proof. First consider the case when G is absent. Then it is clear that\ngcd{rj , j \u2265 1} = 1 is a necessary condition for F : \b \u2192 \b to be mixing and Young\n[24, Lemma 5] shows that this condition is also sufficient. The idea is that the required\nmixing takes place at the base \b0 of the tower (where the return map f Y is identical for\nfh and Fh\u25e6\u03c0 ) and the greatest common divisor condition ensures that simultaneous returns\nto the base occur. The arguments are identical when G is present so we omit the details. \u0001\nWe obtain a special case of Theorem 1.2 as a consequence of Theorem 4.4.\nCOROLLARY 5.3. Theorem 1.2 holds under the additional hypothesis that the\nobservations \u03c6 and \u03c8 are supported on Y \u00d7 G.\nProof. As above, we have the measure-preserving projection \u03c0 : \b \u00d7 G \u2192 X \u00d7 G\nwhere \b is a Young tower. By Proposition 5.1(i), Ho\u00a8lder cocycles h0 : X \u2192 G lift to\nLipschitz cocycles h \u25e6 \u03c0 : \b \u2192 G and similarly Ho\u00a8lder observations on Y \u00d7 G lift\nto Lipschitz observations on \b0 \u00d7 G. A simple argument [24, p. 607] shows that it is no\nloss of generality to assume that gcd{rj , j \u2265 1} = 1. Then Proposition 5.2 guarantees that\nFh\u25e6\u03c0 : \b \u00d7 G \u2192 \b \u00d7 G is mixing.\nHence, it suffices to prove decay of correlations under the assumptions that Fh :\n\b \u00d7 G \u2192 \b \u00d7 G is a mixing group extension defined by a Lipschitz cocycle h : X \u2192 G\nand \u03c6(x, g) = gv(x), \u03c8(x, g) = gw(x) are equivariant observations supported on\n\b0 \u00d7 G where v : \b0 \u2192 Rd is Lipschitz (and hence lies in the Banach space B) and\nw \u2208 L\u221e(\b0,Rd ).\nBy Theorem 4.4, it remains to show that\n\u2211\nj\u2265n \u00b5(Zj )(1 + |1Zj hj |\u03b8 ) = O(n\u2212\u03b2).\nHere Zn is the union of partition elements of \b0 on which r takes the value of n.\nIf x, y \u2208 Zn, then using the definition of d\u03b8 on \b we compute that\n|hn(x) \u2212 hn(y)| \u2264\nn\u22121\u2211\n\n=0\n|h(f \nx) \u2212 h(f \ny)| \u2264 |h|\u03b8\nn\u22121\u2211\n\n=0\nd\u03b8(f\n\nx, f \ny) = n|h|\u03b8d\u03b8 (x, y).\nHence, |1Znhn|\u03b8 \u2264 n|h|\u03b8 . By assumption\n\u2211\nj\u2265n \u00b5(Zj) = O(n\u2212(\u03b2+1)) and so we obtain\nthe required O(n\u2212\u03b2) estimate. \u0001\nRemark 5.4. If in addition h is supported in Y or h is locally constant, then we obtain the\nimproved O(n\u2212(\u03b2+1)) estimate mentioned in Remark 1.3(b).\n5.2. Decay of correlations for observations on X \u00d7G. In this subsection, we complete\nthe proof of Theorem 1.2 by extending Corollary 5.3 to the case where observations are\ndefined on the whole of X \u00d7 G. Again, it suffices to work at the level of a tower group\nextension Fh : \b\u00d7G \u2192 \b\u00d7G. As before, h : \b \u2192 G is a Lipschitz cocycle. We consider\nobservations \u03c6,\u03c8 : \b\u00d7 G \u2192 Rd of the form \u03c6(x, g) = gv(x), \u03c8(x, g) = gw(x), where\nv : \b \u2192 Rd is Lipschitz and w \u2208 L\u221e(\b,Rd).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1734 H. Bruin et al\nDefine B(\b) to consist of globally Lipschitz functions v : \b \u2192 Cd with \u2016v\u2016\u03b8 =\n|v|\u221e + |v|\u03b8 where |v|\u03b8 is the Lipschitz constant with respect to d\u03b8 . Define B(\b0) in the\nsame way for functions v : \b0 \u2192 Cd , so B(\b0) coincides with the space B from \u00a74.\nRecall that Lhv = L(h\u22121v) where L denotes the transfer operator corresponding to\nthe tower map F : \b \u2192 \b. Following Goue\u00a8zel [9, 10], we estimate the norm of\nLnh : B(\b) \u2192 L1(\b).\nWrite (Lnhv)(x) =\n\u2211\nFnz=x gn(z)hn(z)\u22121v(z) where gn(z) is the inverse of the Jacobian\nof Fn at z. It follows from the definition of the tower that g1(z) = 1 if z \u2208 \bj,\n for\n0 \u2264 \n \u2264 rj \u2212 2. Moreover, if z \u2208 \bj,0, then grj is Lipschitz and coincides with the inverse\nof the Jacobian of F0 : \bj,0 \u2192 \b0.\nDefine An : L\u221e(\b0,Cd ) \u2192 L1(\b,Cd) by\n(Anv)(x) =\n\u2211\nFnz=x\nz\u2208\b0\nFz \f\u2208\b0,...,F nz \f\u2208\b0\ngn(z)hn(z)\n\u22121v(z).\nNote that Anv is supported on level n of the tower, and that for x in level n we have\n(Anv)(x) = hn(z)\u22121v(z) where z is the unique point in \b0 with Fnz = x.\nFor brevity, we let |An|\u221e,1 denote the operator norm of An : L\u221e(\b0,Cd ) \u2192\nL1(\b,Cd).\nLEMMA 5.5. |An|\u221e,1 = O(n\u2212(\u03b2+1)).\nProof. Since |h\u22121n | \u2261 1, it is immediate that |Anv|\u221e \u2264 |v|\u221e. Also, the support of Anv\n(contained in level n of the tower) has measure at most \u2211rj>n \u00b5(\bj,0) = \u00b5(r > n).\nThe result follows. \u0001\nDefine Bn : B(\b) \u2192 B(\b0) by\n(Bnv)(x) =\n\u2211\nFnz=x\nz \f\u2208\b0,...,F n\u22121z \f\u2208\b0\nFnz\u2208\b0\ngn(z)hn(z)\n\u22121v(z).\nLEMMA 5.6. \u2016Bn\u2016 = O(n\u2212\u03b2).\nProof. It follows from the definition of Bn that each preimage z lies in \bj,rj\u2212n for some\nj with rj > n. If z and z\u2032 are compatible preimages of x and x \u2032, then |v(z) \u2212 v(z\u2032)| \u2264\n|v|\u03b8d\u03b8 (z, z\u2032) = \u03b8 |v|\u03b8d\u03b8 (x, x \u2032). Moreover, gn(z) = ep(y) where y \u2208 \bj,0 with F0y = x\nand p is the Lipschitz potential for F0. Hence we obtain estimates of the form\n\u2016Bn\u2016 \u2264 C\n\u2211\nrj>n\n\u00b5(\bj,0)(1 + |1\bj,rj\u2212nhn|\u03b8 ),\nin the same way as was done for \u2016Rn\u2016 in Corollary 4.3(b).

As in \u00a75.1, we first reduce to the case of a mixing group extension\nFh : \b \u00d7 G \u2192 \b \u00d7 G where F : \b \u2192 \b is a tower map and h : \b \u2192 G is\na Lipschitz cocycle. This time we consider equivariant observations \u03c6(x, g) = gv(x),\n\u03c8(x, g) = gw(x) defined on the whole of \b \u00d7 G, so v \u2208 B(\b) and w \u2208 L\u221e(\b,Rd).\nBy Corollary 5.7, we have \u2016Lnh\u2016 = O(n\u2212\u03b2). Decay of correlations on \b \u00d7 G follows\nimmediately by the same argument as in the last three lines of the proof of Theorem 4.4.\u0001\n5.3. Group extensions of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems. In this subsection, we\nconsider the case of a compact group extension M \u00d7 G where f : M \u2192 M is non-\nuniformly hyperbolic in the sense of Young [24]. Part of the set up in [24] is that there is a\n\u2018physical\u2019 f -invariant ergodic probability measure \u00b5 and a \u2018uniformly hyperbolic\u2019 subset\n\u0013 \u2282 M with an integrable return time function r : \u0013 \u2192 N. If h : M \u2192 G is a Ho\u00a8lder\ncocycle, we define the group extension fh : M \u00d7 G \u2192 M \u00d7 G. Consider equivariant\nobservations of the form \u03c6(x, g) = gv(x) where v : M \u2192 Rd . As before, \u03c6 is said to be\n\u03b3 -Ho\u00a8lder if v is \u03b3 -Ho\u00a8lder, and we define \u2016\u03c6\u2016\u03b3 = |v|\u221e + |v|\u03b3 .\nTHEOREM 5.8. Let fh : M \u00d7 G \u2192 M \u00d7 G be a mixing compact group extension of\na non-uniformly hyperbolic system as above, where h : M \u2192 G is a Ho\u00a8lder cocycle.\nAssume that\n\u00b5(y \u2208 \u0013 : r(y) \u2265 n) = O(n\u2212(\u03b2+1)),\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 26 May 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.69\n1736 H. Bruin et al\nfor some \u03b2 > 1. Let G act orthogonally on Rd . Then for any \u03b2 \u2032 < \u03b2, there exists a\nconstant C > 0 such that for all Ho\u00a8lder equivariant observations \u03c6,\u03c8 : M \u00d7 G \u2192 Rd ,\n\u03c1\u03c6,\u03c8 (n) \u2264 C\u2016\u03c6\u2016\u03b3 \u2016\u03c8\u2016\u03b3 n\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 .\nAs in the non-uniformly expanding case, f : M \u2192 M can be modelled by a tower\nF : \b \u2192 \b. This tower has an F -invariant foliation by stable disks, leading to a quotient\ntower map F\u00af : \b\u00af \u2192 \b\u00af. For each \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1), define a metric d\u03b8 on \b\u00af as in \u00a75.1. (We note\nthat the quotient tower map F\u00af : \b\u00af \u2192 \b\u00af corresponds to the tower map F : \b \u2192 \b\nin \u00a75.1.) There are invariant measures m = \u00b5\u00d7 \u03bd on M \u00d7G, m\u2032 = \u00b5\u2032 \u00d7 \u03bd on \b\u00d7G, and\nm\u00af = \u00b5\u00af \u00d7 \u03bd on \b\u00af \u00d7 G, and measure-preserving semiconjugacies \u03c0 : \b \u00d7 G \u2192 M \u00d7 G\nand \u03c0\u00af : \b \u00d7 G \u2192 \b\u00af \u00d7 G.\nThe reduction to the non-uniformly expanding case breaks into three main steps\n(cf. [6] in the uniformly hyperbolic case).\n(1) Define h\u02c6 = h \u25e6 \u03c0 : \b \u2192 G and \u03c6\u02c6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c0 , \u03c8\u02c6 = \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c0 : \b \u00d7 G \u2192 Rd . It suffices\nto establish decay of correlations for the observations \u03c6\u02c6, \u03c8\u02c6 and group extension F\nh\u02c6\n.\n(2) A version of the \u2018Sinai trick\u2019 [22] shows that h\u02c6 is cohomologous to a cocycle\nh\u02dc : \b \u2192 G that \u2018depends only on future coordinates\u2019. In other words, h\u02dc is constant\non stable disks and projects down to a cocycle h\u00af : \b\u00af \u2192 G. Moreover, h\u00af is Lipschitz\nwith respect to the metric d\u03b8 . Details in the case of R-valued cocycles are given in [17],\nand the argument there generalizes to compact group extensions using [19, Appendix II].\nGroup extensions by cohomologous cocycles are topologically conjugate, so there is\nalmost no loss in carrying out this step. However, the observations \u03c6\u02c6 and \u03c8\u02c6 are slightly\nmodified in the process, yielding new observations \u03c6\u02dc and \u03c8\u02dc (which need not be lifts of\nHo\u00a8lder observations on M).\n(3) Write \u03c6\u02dc(x, g) = gv\u02dc(x), \u03c8\u02dc(x, g) = gw\u02dc(x). To estimate \u222b\n\b\u00d7G \u03c6\u02dc (\u03c8\u02dc\nT \u25e6 Fn\nh\u02dc\n) dm\u2032,\nit suffices to estimate\n\u222b\n\b\nh\u02dc\u22121n v\u02dc (w\u02dcT \u25e6 Fn) d\u00b5\u2032. Let k \u2265 1. By [15, Lemma 5.4], we can\nconstruct vk : \b \u2192 Rd such that:\n(a) vk depends only on future coordinates and projects to vk : \b\u00af \u2192 Rd ;\n(b) |vk|\u221e \u2264 |v|\u221e, |vk |\u03b8 \u2264 2\u03b8\u22122k|v|\u221e, |v\u02dc \u25e6 Fk \u2212 vk |\u221e \u2264 C1\u2016v\u2016\u03b3 \u03b1k .\nSimilarly, we define wk : \b \u2192 Rd . Here, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) is a constant arising from the\nnon-uniformly hyperbolic structure of f and the Ho\u00a8lder exponent \u03b3 .\nFollowing [15, \u00a75(b)], the expression \u222b\b h\u02dc\u22121n v\u02dc (w\u02dcT \u25e6 Fn) d\u00b5\u2032 breaks up into three\nintegrals, two of which are of order \u03b1k by (b). The third integral is given by I3 =\u222b\n\b h\u02dc\n\u22121\nn (h\u02dckvk) ((h\u02dckwk)\nT \u25e6 Fn) d\u00b5\u2032. The integrand projects down to \b\u00af and so I3 =\u222b\n\b\u00af\nLn\nh\u00af\n(h\u00afkvk) (h\u00afkwk)\nT d\u00b5\u00af. By our results in the non-uniformly expanding case, |I3| \u2264\nC2n\u2212\u03b2\u2016h\u00afkvk\u2016\u03b8 |h\u00afkwk|\u221e. By (b), this leads easily to |I3| \u2264 C3n\u2212\u03b2\u03b8\u22122k|v|\u221e|w|\u221e. Hence,\ndecay of correlations is estimated by C4(\u03b1k + n\u2212\u03b2\u03b8\u22122k). Choosing k = k(n) so that\n\u03b1k \u223c n\u2212\u03b2\u03b8\u22122k, and choosing \u03b8 close to 1, we obtain the required decay rate n\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 with \u03b2 \u2032\nclose to \u03b2.\nA.

Hence\u222b ( \u2211\ni1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ik=n\nR\u02c6ik \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 R\u02c6i2R\u02c6i1\u03c6\n)\n\u03c8 =\n\u222b\n\u03c61Z (1Z\u03c8) \u25e6 f n =\n\u222b\nT\u02c6n\u03c6 \u03c8,\nproving part (a).\nRestricting to L1(Z) and summing (A.1) over n yields\u222b ( \u221e\u2211\nn=1\nR\u02c6n\u03c6\n)\n\u03c8 =\n\u222b\n\u03c6 \u03c8 \u25e6 f Z =\n\u222b\nR\u02c6\u03c6 \u03c8,\nso that R\u02c6 =\u2211\u221en=1 R\u02c6n. Hence R\u02c6\u03c9\u03c6 = R\u02c6(eir\u03c9\u03c6) =\u2211\u221en=1 R\u02c6n(eir\u03c9\u03c6). But\nR\u02c6n(e\nir\u03c9\u03c6) = L\u02c6n(1Zneir\u03c9\u03c6) = L\u02c6n(1Znein\u03c9\u03c6) = R\u02c6n(\u03c6)ein\u03c9,\nand part (b) follows. \u0001\nAcknowledgements.
