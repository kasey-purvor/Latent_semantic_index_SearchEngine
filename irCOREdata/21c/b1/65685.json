Managing Ethical Issues in \nHigher Education\u201d that was distributed to all U.K. universities and equivalent (HEIs) \nin October 2005. The publication proposed that HEIs should put in place an \ninstitution-wide ethical policy framework, well beyond the customary focus on \nresearch ethics, together with the mechanisms necessary to ensure its implementation. \nHaving summarised the processes that led to the publication and the publication itself, \nthe paper then considers whether following the now common-place corporate practice \nof implementing a code of ethics is appropriate for such institutions. Drawing on both \nthe empirical evidence in relation to codes in the business ethics literature and a \nconsideration of the nature of the university as an institution, the paper offers an \nalternative suggestion for how ethical issues in higher education might be managed. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n\u201cNo university ought to be merely a national institution, even if it is \nsupported by the nation. The universities of Europe should have their \ncommon ideals, they should have their obligations towards each other. They \nshould be independent of the countries in which they are situated. They \nshould not be institutions for the training of an efficient bureaucracy, or for \nequipping scientists to get the better of foreign scientists; they should stand \nfor the preservation of learning, for the pursuit of truth, and, in so far as \nmen are capable of it, the attainment of wisdom.\u201d  \n(T. S. Eliot 1962: 123) \n \n \nIn October 2005 a report entitled, \u201cEthics Matters. Managing Ethical Issues in Higher \nEducation\u201d, was published jointly in the U.K. by the Council for Industry and Higher \nEducation (CIHE) and Brunel University (CIHE 2005). The report refers to itself as a \n\u201cguide\u201d and this abbreviation, duly capitalised, is used subsequently for convenience. \nThe Guide was distributed to all U.K. universities and equivalent, generally referred \nto as Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), and proposed that HEIs should put in \nplace an institution-wide ethical policy framework, well beyond the customary focus \non research ethics to embrace all of the institution\u201fs activities and including the \nresponsibilities of students, together with the mechanisms necessary to ensure its \nimplementation. \n \nThis paper first reviews the background to, motivation for and process that was \nfollowed in producing the Guide. It then summarises its content and the immediate \nimpact of its publication. \n                                                 \n\uf02a\n Professor of Business Ethics, Durham Business School, Durham University, U.K. and a member of \nDurham University\u201fs Ethics Advisory Committee. \n 2 \n \nThe Guide generally eschews the word \u201ccode\u201d (although Box One of the Guide refers \nto a \u201ccode of ethics or ethical framework\u201d and it is acknowledged that the Guide as a \nwhole evolved out of the IBE code booklet (IBE 2003) \u2013 see pages 11 and 22 \nrespectively). Instead, and as noted, the Guide refers to an institution-wide ethical \npolicy framework. It is clear, however, that the implementation of its \nrecommendations in an HEI would be equivalent to a code of ethics by any other \nname. This raises the question whether the common-place corporate practice of \nimplementing a code of ethics, with all its attendant issues, is appropriately \ntransferable to the higher education sphere. A review of the literature on ethical codes \nsuggests that all the mechanisms for enforcement that the Guide recommends would \nbe equally required in HEIs and that its success might be just as difficult, if not more \nso, to guarantee in HEIs as in the corporate sphere. \n \nThis leads, however, to a consideration of the nature of HEIs as institutions. The \nGuide accepts that there is a difference between HEIs and the corporate sector, but \nnonetheless proposes a corporate solution. If, however, an HEI is considered to be, in \nits very essence, a fundamentally different kind of institution, then it may be that a \ncorporate solution is not only not transferable but, if implemented, a further nail in the \ncoffin of the idea of a university. The paper, then, concludes by offering an \nalternative suggestion for managing ethics in higher education. \n \n \nThe Guide \n \nBackground, motivation and process\n1\n \n \nThe Guide originated in a CIHE event in March 2004 at St. George\u201fs House, Windsor \non \u201cHigher Education as a Public Good\u201d, at which ethical issues in higher education \nwere discussed. CIHE\u201fs mission \u201cis to advance all kinds of learning through the \nfostering of mutual understanding, co-operation and support between higher \neducation and business\u201d (CIHE 2005), and leadership in higher education, including \nethical leadership, was already a focus for CIHE. Hence, the event, at which Philippa \nFoster Back, Director of the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE) spoke, was part of a \ncontinuing debate. Following the event, CIHE and Brunel University jointly \napproached the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), which \nsupported the project from its Governance, Leadership and Management fund, \nproviding \u00a367,000.\n2\n The support of other key agencies was also elicited: Universities \nU.K. (UUK); Standing Conference of Principals (SCOP); Committee of University \nChairmen (CUC); The Higher Education Academy; Leadership Foundation for \nHigher Education; and the Centre for Business and Public Sector Ethics at \nCambridge. \n \nCIHE was already aware of IBE which was established \u201cto encourage high standards \nof corporate and business behaviour and the sharing of best practice\u201d \n(www.ibe.org.uk), and in particular its work on codes of ethics (IBE 2003, for \nexample), and thought this a useful approach. Having been a speaker at the March \n2004 CIHE event, IBE was then invited to manage the project with the eventual \noutcome being the production of a report \u2013 the Guide. Although HEIs were clearly \ninvolved, both through their representative organisations (as above) and directly (see \n 3 \nbelow), it is clear that the initiative\u201fs origins were more from a business than \nacademic perspective. Given this, and IBE\u201fs involvement, it was perhaps likely that \nthe outcome would follow corporate practice and be in the form of a template code \nand associated implementation measures. \n \nIn addition to CIHE\u201fs interest in ethical leadership, another motivating factor behind \nthe project was the general encouragement for HEIs to become more commercial. \nDiversifying income streams, so that HEIs become less dependent upon government \nfunding, has been a continuing theme in U.K. higher education, supported both by \ngovernment (which has sought to limit its funding particularly as the Age \nParticipation Index has increased (Smith 1999:152 and 155)), and by HEIs \nthemselves (which have sought to limit their exposure to one major income stream, \nand a politically motivated one at that). This increasing pressure to become more \ncommercial seems to have been a motivating factor in two ways \u2013 first through the \ninteresting implication that becoming more commercial necessarily leads to the \ntemptation to become less ethical, and second through assuming that a corporate-style \nresponse (a code) would therefore be an appropriate way of dealing with the issue. \n \nThe project was established with an active Advisory Group comprising academics, \nmembers of academic-representative organisations and business people, and chaired \nby Professor Stephen Schwartz, then Vice-Chancellor of Brunel University. One of \nits first activities was a survey of SCOP and UUK members, carried out in December \n2004. The outcome of this survey is summarised in the Guide (Appendix 1). A high \nresponse rate (63%) from 99 HEIs led to a convincing set of conclusions: there is a \nlack of common discourse on ethical issues in higher education; there is \nfragmentation with HEIs tending to have a series of different documents rather than a \ncoherent institution-wide approach; there is inconsistency in the approach and \nlanguage of ethics-related documents; and there is an overwhelming emphasis on \nresearch ethics. On the other hand, 73% of respondents said that their institutions had \npublished a statement of their institution\u201fs values. \n \nWhile this survey was being analysed a further event at St. George\u201fs House, Windsor \nin January 2005 offered an opportunity to gather information and discover different \nperspectives on the project from delegates across a broad spectrum \u2013 including \nacademics, students and trade unions. Armed with the evidence from the survey and \nthis more anecdotal evidence, a first draft of the Guide was produced and \ndisseminated via UUK and SCOP in April 2005. Comments were received from 53 \nHEIs and CIHE also had a detailed discussion with some 15 members from Church \nColleges. Generally, feedback was positive although there were a number of \nsuggestions, notable among these being a request for the inclusion of an illustrative \nguide. \n \nA revised version of the Guide was then produced and presented at a national \nconsultative conference in June 2005, which over 90 delegates attended. This \nconfirmed the usefulness of the document but with further suggested amendments. \nThe Guide became shorter as a result, with less on the need for high standards of \nethics (which was already accepted), inessential background removed, but the \nillustrative guide (which became Part II of the final version) definitively included. \nAlso in June 2005, the Times Higher Education Supplement (THES \u2013 a national \n 4 \nweekly newspaper on higher education) carried an eight page supplement trailing the \npublication and content of the Guide (THES 2005). \n \nThe Guide was then further discussed, going through several versions, and agreed by \nthe Advisory Group via e-mail over the summer of 2005, before being published on 5 \nOctober 2005 and disseminated to all Vice-Chancellors or equivalent. The publication \nreceived support from the Prime Minister, Tony Blair (www.cihe-\nuk.com\/ethicsPM.php, accessed 25 May 2006). It also received some media attention \nwith Guardian Education (4 October, \u201eWhose line is it anyway?\u201f), Education \nGuardian Online (5 October, \u201eUniversities urged to draw up their own ethical \npolicies\u201f), the Financial Times (6 October, \u201eUniversities\u201f commercial activity needs \nethical control\u201f and \u201eCall for universities to develop ethics code\u201f) and the THES (7 \nOctober, \u201eGuide steers campuses through moral mazes\u201f), all giving coverage. \nInterestingly, Professor Stephen Schwartz, the Chair of the Advisory Group, writing \nin the Financial Times (the titles of whose article are themselves of note), argued that \n\u201c[m]odern universities are serious commercial players and are increasingly being \nviewed with the same scepticism as their industry partners \u2026 All universities have \nethical standards for research, but they also need to address the ethical issues that \narise from commercial activity\u201d. Again the stress on the commercial as motivation for \nthe Guide is evident. \n \nThe contents of the Guide \n \nThe Guide is 36 pages long and, in its substantive sections, consists of two parts. Part \nI contains four chapters. Chapter 1 (\u201eThe case for articulating ethics\u201f) discusses ethics \nin higher education, referring in passing to the \u201cNolan Principles\u201d for Standards in \nPublic Life,\n3\n and giving a wide range of external and internal reasons for HEIs to \ntackle ethical issues. It then discusses why an HEI should publish an institution-wide \nethical policy framework, referring to the fragmented approach to ethics in higher \neducation that the December 2004 survey had revealed (summarised, as noted above, \nin Appendix 1). \n \nChapter 2 (\u201eThinking about ethical issues in higher education\u201f) gives several \nexamples of ethical dilemmas (overseas partnership opportunities, advances in public \nhealth and intellectual property rights, friction in the community involving student \nresidences, a student suicide, freedom of speech involving an academic and a charge \nof racism, handling people in a job cuts situation). It then contains an interesting \nsection raising issues about how to go about tackling such dilemmas. Of eight issues \nto consider only two refer to \u201cguidance provided by existing codes or other ethics-\nrelated documents\u201d and ensuring that \u201cindividuals adhere to a particular solution\u201d, \nwhile others include reference to the institution\u201fs mission and values, whether staff \nshould be told what to do or use their judgement, and how an open culture where \nethical issues can be disclosed and discussed can be encouraged. \n \nChapter 3 (\u201eDeveloping a framework\u201f) discusses the process of developing an \ninstitution-wide ethical policy framework. The sub-sections cover: the need for \nleadership and endorsement; the need for time and resources; starting with values; \nbuilding on what exists already; learning from others; thinking about language and \nlength; deciding on the beginning (a word from the head of the institution) and the \nend (how it will be implemented); choosing a structure (stakeholder, issues-based, \n 5 \nfunctions-based or a hybrid); producing and testing a first draft; and finalising the \nframework. \n \nChapter 4 (\u201ePolicy into practice\u201f) develops the point made in the Executive Summary \nthat, \u201c[s]imply publishing a framework will not ensure ethical behaviour. The \nframework needs to be put into practice through training, monitoring, review and \nreporting\u201d (8). In order for the framework to be \u201cread, understood and used \nthroughout the institution\u201d (19) a series of implementation measures are discussed \ncovering: leadership; a committee; publication and dissemination of the framework \n(with encouragement that it be read!); training and staff development; adherence, \nincluding how breaches will be handled and whether the framework should be signed \nup to; monitoring and measurement; help advice and whistle-blowing; reviewing the \nframework; and reporting on its implementation. \n \nPart II then contains the illustrative framework. This begins with a health warning \nthat it is not intended to be a template and that, \u201cit simply provides an idea of the \nissues and approach that institutions may want to think about in developing their own \nframework\u201d (22). The Foreword refers to HEIs developing their own \u201c\u201esignature\u201f \nstatements\u201d (6), and it is clearly the intention of the authors that the illustrative \nframework is not adopted in an uncritical manner. Indeed the Guide is explicit in this: \n\u201cPlease do not simply adopt this illustration\u201d (22). The illustrative framework, over \nthe next nine pages (23-31), then adopts a functions-based approach focussing on \nhigher education activities. It covers: preamble (to include mission and values \nstatements); purpose and use of the framework; teaching, learning and assessment; \nresearch and development; the student experience; business and local communities; \nleadership and governance; management (actually human resources); adherence; \nresources (links to other ethics-related documents); and an index. \n \n \nInitial reflections on the Guide \n \nThe Guide is clearly the outcome of an exhaustive process involving the appropriate \nconstituencies. Although the initiative\u201fs origins were more from a business than \nacademic perspective, the consultation processes and the involvement of academics \nand their representative bodies on the Advisory Group, has led to significant \ndevelopment during the process, making the Guide appropriate to HEIs. It is a guide, \nnot a prescriptive \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d code. It is clearly written, presented in a \nprofessional manner and contains helpful examples and illustrations. It may, as a \nresult of all of this, be adopted widely. \n \nIn terms of its diagnosis of the ethical issues in HEIs, the Guide does a good job. The \ntypes of dilemmas facing HEIs (Chapter 2) are easily recognisable \u2013 indeed many in \nHEIs reading it will have been faced with exactly these issues. The Guide\u201fs analysis \nof the fragmented nature in which ethical issues are currently approached in HEIs \nalso rings true. \n \nThe prescription that the Guide recommends \u2013 the writing and implementation of an \ninstitution-wide ethical policy framework, or, as has been argued above, a code of \nethics by any other name \u2013 is hardly novel, even if it has been adapted in an attempt \nto suit HEIs. It is, of course, the favoured solution in corporations, where it has a long \n 6 \nhistory. Two questions therefore arise. Does the evidence from the corporate sphere \nsuggest that the implementation of the Guide\u201fs recommendations (appropriately \nadapted by each HEI to suit its own situation) will be successful in encouraging the \nethical behaviour of HEIs and their staff and students? Secondly, is the transfer of a \ncorporate solution to a very different type of institution appropriate, or would it, in its \nimplementation, have a significant detrimental effect upon the very nature of the \ninstitutions it is attempting to assist? \n \n \nCodes of ethics in the corporate sphere \n \nDefinition, types and motivation \n \nA review of the literature on codes of ethics in the corporate sphere is not particularly \nencouraging to the project represented by the Guide. A code of ethics is commonly \ndefined as \u201ca written, distinct, and formal document which consists of moral \nstandards used to guide employee or corporate behaviour\u201d (Schwartz 2001: 248), but \nit is recognised that such documents can take a variety of forms. One means of \ncategorising codes is in terms of their character: inspirational (a statement of ideals); \nregulatory (detailed rules to govern conduct); or educational (buttressing of \nunderstanding of prescriptive provisions with commentary and interpretation) (Farrell \net al. 2002: 159). In terms of content, codes also vary in relation to the ethical issues \nthey address. One helpful categorisation of ethical issues provides three clusters \u2013 \nissues impacting primarily on employees, or on companies or on wider society (Stohs \n& Brannick 1999: 315). \n \nThe motivation for producing and implementing a code of ethics similarly varies. \nFollowing from the categorisation given above, the evidence suggests a greater focus \non internal issues (particularly on employees) and on issues related to the company \nitself than on issues relating to other parties and wider society including consumer, \ncommunity and environmental stakeholders (see O\u201fDwyer & Madden 2006: 219). \nThis suggests that the motivation for introducing a code relates more to firm \nprotection and compliance issues (preventing harm, particularly to the company) than \nto a more positive and outward looking motivation. \n \nImplementation issues \n \nWith regard to implementation, most studies reinforce the point made in the Guide \nthat a code of ethics by itself is insufficient, and the implementation measures \nmentioned in Chapter 4 of the Guide are all found in studies of code implementation. \nThe findings from these studies are, however, unconvincing in relation to the \nconsistency and rigour with which codes are implemented. Two major studies, one \nbased in the U.S.A. with a 26% response rate from the Fortune 1000 service and \nindustrial firms (Weaver et al. 1999) and a European study with a 14.2% response \nrate from the top 1000 companies in Ireland (O\u201fDwyer & Madden 2006) provide a \nuseful basis on which to assess implementation issues. \n \nWho writes the code is itself an important issue, with wide involvement generally \nrecommended if employee acceptance is to be high (O\u201fDwyer & Madden 2006: 220). \nCodes need to be distributed, but practice and the breadth of distribution varies with \n 7 \nsome evidence of lower distribution to lower levels in the corporation (Weaver et al. \n1999: 287). O\u201fDwyer & Madden (2006: 228) found that 11% of firms had no formal \nmethod of introducing the code to new staff.  \n \nWhether employees are then required to acknowledge receipt and confirm compliance \nwith the code is also a matter of variation, Weaver et al. (1999: 287) finding that 90% \nof firms in their study  required acknowledgement of receipt at least once in the \nemployee\u201fs career but only 45% on an at-least annual basis. Acknowledgement of \ncompliance was similar with 85% of firms requiring this at least once while 51% \nrequired it on an at-least annual basis. As Weaver et al. (1999: 287) note, since nearly \nhalf the firms make no effort to require employees repeatedly to acknowledge or \nrecommit to the firm\u201fs ethical policies they risk \u201ca situation in which codes are noted \nonce and then forgotten\u201d. This is confirmed by other studies. Nijhof et al. in their \nstudy of the municipality of Amsterdam reported that management acknowledged that \nemployees \u201chardly ever read the code\u201d (2003: 75) and Schwartz that \u201c[m]ost \nrespondents \u2026 had never taken the time to read the entire document. More often than \nnot, they had skimmed through the document or had taken a quick look at the table of \ncontents\u201d (2001: 252). O\u201fDwyer & Madden (2006: 228) found that only 24% of the \nfirms in their study reinforced the code regularly. Code revision has also been studied \nwith O\u201fDwyer & Madden (2006: 228) finding that only 66% of non-multinationals \nand 68% of multinationals had amended their codes at some point. \n \nIn relation to institutional level support ethics personnel and ethics offices seem to be \nthe most prevalent mechanisms. In Weaver et al.\u201fs study 54% of firms reported a \nsingle officer specifically assigned to deal with ethics and conduct issues, and 30% of \nfirms had specific departments or offices (1999: 288). Similarly, O\u201fDwyer & Madden \nfound that 62% of firms in their study reported formal procedures for staff to seek \nadvice, the most popular route utilised by 84% of these companies being dedicated \npersonnel, with telephone hotlines being the next most popular channel (2006: 229). \nWeaver et al. also found 51% of firms had adopted some kind of telephone-based \nsystem (1999: 290). Nijhof et al. (2003: 74) report a \u201cBureau of Integrity\u201d comprising \n15 employees for a municipality with 22,000 employees. Ethics committees, which \nare included in the Guide, are not mentioned in most studies, but do find their place in \nan interesting description of implementing a student code of ethics in a U.S.A. \nBusiness School, the committee being entitled the \u201cIntegrity Standards Committee\u201d \n(Weber 2006: 31). Training for employees is another issue, with Weaver et al. finding \nthat, \u201c[d]epending upon employee rank, fully one-fifth to one-third of employees \nreceive no ethics training or education of any sort\u201d (1999: 291). Other issues, relating \nto top management\u201fs continuing involvement, channels to report violations, \ninvestigation of alleged violations, disciplinary procedures and evaluations or \nassessments of the impact of codes also receive attention in this literature (Weaver et \nal. 1999, Nijhof et al. 2003, O\u201fDwyer & Madden 2006). \n \nBy way of summary, then, it is clear that the recommendations in the Guide are \nalready in evidence in the corporate sphere and that implementing a code of ethics is \na complex, time-consuming and difficult task. Interestingly, there are no studies \nwhich attempt either a cost analysis or, perhaps more importantly, a cost-benefit \nanalysis of the code implementation. However, a number of studies do address issues \nof effectiveness in terms of behavioural outcomes, and it is to these that we now turn. \n \n 8 \nBehavioural effects \n \nSince implementing a code of ethics is such a major undertaking, it is presumably \nbecause of its effectiveness in influencing behaviour that corporations have adopted \nthem. Unfortunately, again, the evidence is unconvincing. Schwartz (2001) reviewed \nnineteen studies published between 1979 and 1998 in which empirical research had \nbeen undertaken to review code effectiveness. The findings showed that eight studies \nfound a significant positive relationship, two a weak relationship and nine an \ninsignificant relationship. Schwartz concluded that, \u201c[a]lthough the \u2026 studies have \nmoved theoretical and empirical research focusing on codes of ethics further, the \nresearch remains inconclusive regarding the impact of codes on behaviour\u201d (2001: \n249). In his own study \u201cfew respondents were able to provide specific examples of \nwhere they acted differently as a result of the code. The vast majority indicated that \nthe code had not modified their behaviour \u2026\u201d (Schwartz 2001: 253). Having said \nthat, there were some examples of behaviour modification and ethics officers \n\u201cindicated that they had received numerous questions and queries regarding their \ncodes\u201d which \u201cpoints to the code\u201fs influence in causing at least some employees to be \nconcerned over appropriate behaviour\u201d (2001: 253). \n \nMarnburg (2000), in a study presumably not available to Schwartz, tested differences \nin ethical attitudes (attitudes being linked to behaviour) between employees in \ncompanies with and without codes. The study found no significant difference, thereby \nadding further to the inconclusive evidence. Marnburg logically asks \u201cwhy so many \ncompanies use ethical codes, when their behavioural effect is missing\u201d. \n \nPerhaps the classic case in the missing link between codes and their behavioural \nimpact is Enron. Enron had an \u201cimage of being an excellent corporate citizen, with all \nthe corporate social responsibility \u2026 and business ethics tools and status symbols in \nplace\u201d, such that, \u201c[a]ccording to the values statement in Enron\u201fs Code of Ethics and \nits annual report, the company maintains strong commitments to communication, \nrespect, integrity and excellence\u201d (Sims & Brinkman 2003: 254 and 249 \nrespectively). Despite having in place what Sims & Brinkman refer to as a \u201cwell-\nfilled CSR and business ethics toolbox\u201d (2003: 253), it is clear that the leadership at \nEnron and the culture produced as a result meant that, not only was the company\u201fs \ncode of ethics actually suspended at least twice in the Chief Financial Officer\u201fs \ndealing with the Board (Sims & Brinkmann 2003: 247), but in practice the code of \nethics was in something like a state of suspended animation. \n \nFurther considerations \n \nSims & Brinkmann\u201fs (2003) article leads on to a number of other considerations \nwhich have arisen from reflections on the issues that codes raise. They themselves, \ndrawing on Schein\u201fs work on organisational culture (Schein 1985), suggest that \nSchein would regard such tools as \u201csecondary articulation and reinforcement \nmechanisms\u201d. If codes of ethics are secondary mechanisms then primary mechanisms \nare leadership and culture. In addition, the environment in which the firm operates, in \nparticular the moral climate of the industry, may be a \u201cmediating condition\u201d \n(Brinkmann & Imms 2003: 269) which influences code effects in either a positive or \nnegative manner. The points are simply that codes do not operate in isolation and that \nother factors \u2013 the environment, organisational culture and leadership \u2013 may be just as \n 9 \nimportant, if not more so, in determining the ethical behaviour of organisations and \ntheir members. \n \nBrinkmann & Imms also raise the issue of the \u201cethicalness\u201d of codes themselves. In a \ndiscussion of virtue ethics perspectives, where the focus is on the character of the \nactor rather than rules or institutional settings, they raise the question whether codes \n\u201cassume pre-conventional or conventional morality and reproduce rather than \ntranscend such morality\u201d (2003: 267).4 It seems likely, given also some of the \nresponses to the introduction of codes that Schwartz (2001: 253) found \u2013 that \nrespondents already knew what was right and wrong behaviour and that the code was \nmerely common sense \u2013 that codes do little or nothing to promote moral imagination. \nMacIntyre similarly, in a discussion to which we shall return, noted that professions \nsuch as physicians, nurses, accountants, lawyers and corporate executives \u201ccannot \ndispense with a code defining appropriate behaviour both between professional and \nclient and between professional and professional\u201d (1990: 226), but then bemoaned the \nfact that \u201c\u2026 in the realm of professional practice matters which affect problems of \nimmediate action cannot be allowed to go unsettled. One way or another codes must \nbe formulated, choices made, dilemmas resolved, with or without rational \njustification\u201d (226-227). \n \nSummary \n \nIn summary, then, the evidence from over 25 years of research into codes of ethics in \nthe corporate sphere is, as indicated at the outset of this section, hardly encouraging \nof the project that the Guide represents. Codes and their implementation are \nexpensive, certainly in terms of the organisational resource they consume if not in \ndirect expenditure, difficult to implement in a consistent manner, and their \nbehavioural effects are inconclusive. Marnburg\u201fs comment that, \u201c[i]t seems that \nethical codes are an inferior document in most organisations; it does not really matter \nwhether they exist or not\u201d (2000: 208) may be a little strong, but there is certainly \nsome significant evidence in support of it. It seems clear that other factors \u2013 the \nenvironment, organisational culture and leadership \u2013 may well be more important \nthan a code in determining ethical behaviour.  \n \nA code of ethics may also reinforce a \u201cconventional\u201d level of morality amongst \norganisational members. In the corporate sphere it was noted that the primary \nmotivation was one of protection of the corporation \u2013 an essentially negative reason, \nbut one that perhaps fits with a corporate perspective in which employees are \nexpected to comply rather than challenge. The introduction of codes in the corporate \nsphere probably also reflects a lack of any obvious alternative approaches and an \nelement of herd mentality (\u201cif they have one, so should we\u201d). The lack of an \nalternative is something we will return to below. \n \nOne aspect is missing, however, from the above discussion and this is to do with the \nnature of the institution in which such codes are implemented. That it is missing is \nsimply because it is assumed \u2013 the research is on codes of ethics in corporations and \nthey are assumed to be a particular kind of institution, even if in practice there are \ndifferences due to institutional form or culture. But the proposal in the Guide, that \ncodes be introduced into higher education in the U.K., raises precisely this question of \ninstitutional nature. It may be that not only is the introduction of a code problematic \n 10 \nin corporations, but that it is entirely inappropriate in universities. It is to this issue \nthat we now turn. \n \n \nThe idea of a university \n \nSpace here precludes an extended discussion of this complex but important issue, so \nwe can sketch only some of the significant issues. It is, first of all, important to note \nthat the Guide does make some acknowledgement of this issue. The Foreword begins, \n\u201c[d]eep and lasting values underpin our higher education institutions \u2026 Higher \neducation is a public as well as a private good and ethical awareness and practice \ndoes and should inform everything our institutions are and do\u201d (CIHE 2005: 6). But \nbeyond this, the Guide assumes that codes of ethics (albeit adapted for HEIs and \nmade their own by the development of \u201csignature statements\u201d) are transferable from \none kind of institution to another. \n \nThe \u201cidea of a university\u201d is, of course, taken from Cardinal Newman\u201fs series of \nlectures and essays under that title (Ker 1976), written to defend the founding of the \nnew Catholic University of Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century. The dangers \ninherent in attempting to summarise this work in a few sentences are acknowledged, \nbut the point made by Newman in the third of the Discourses is particularly pertinent: \n\u201call knowledge forms one whole, because its subject-matter is one; for the universe \n\u2026 is so intimately knit together, that we cannot separate off portion from portion, and \noperation from operation\u201d except by \u201ca mental abstraction\u201d (cited in Ker 1999: 26). \nCowton (1997: 18) reminds us that \u201cthe word university comes from the medieval \nlatin expression \u201euniversitas magistrorum et scholarum\u201f\u201d meaning something like \n\u201cthe whole body of teachers and students pursuing, at a particular place, the higher \nbranches of learning\u201d. Oakeshott makes a similar claim: \u201c[f]irst, a university is an \nassociation of persons, locally situated, engaged in caring for and attending to the \nwhole intellectual capital which composes a civilization\u201d (1962: 310).  \n \nIf this is so, the essence of a university might be neatly expressed in the phrase \n\u201cthinking with each other\u201d (Smith 2003), provided that this is understood to mean that \nstudents \u201care not merely to learn about a philosophy \u2026: they are to live it, because \nimmersed in it\u201d (Smith 2003: 319). And it is in such a context that Newman criticises \nthe secular University of London, whose proponents \u201cconsider it a sort of bazaar, or \npantechnicon, in which wares of all kinds are heaped together for sale in stalls \nindependent of each other \u2026 whereas, if we would rightly deem of it, a University is \nthe home, it is the mansion house, of the goodly family of the Sciences, sisters all, \nand sisterly in their mutual dispositions\u201d (cited in Ker 1999: 27, emphasis added).  \n \nAll of this, a century and a half after Newman, may seem to be mildly anachronistic \nand we need to acknowledge the shift from an elite to a mass and potentially to a \nuniversal system of higher education as the Age Participation Index increases above \n40% (Smith 1999: 152). We also need to acknowledge the incorporation of \npolytechnics as universities with their more vocational heritage, the separation of \nteaching from research and the \u201cre-introduction of difference into higher education on \nan unprecedented scale\u201d so that fragmentation of the sector is the order of the day \n(Smith 2003: 309-312). Nor can we ignore the increasing market orientation of higher \neducation, noted above by way of commentary on the Guide. \n 11 \n \nBut all of this is essentially descriptive of what HEIs have become or, perhaps, are in \nthe process of becoming. The beginnings of a critique of this comes from an \ninteresting source \u2013 a former minister (1987-1990) for health education and science at \nthe U.K.\u201fs then Department of Education and Science: \n \n \u201cUniversities should never think of themselves as agencies of government \nor departments of state, no matter how worthy the purposes of government \nmay be thought to be. They should understand themselves above all as \nsocial institutions: as an essential part of the fabric of a vigorous and \ndynamic civil society, both contributing to the wider life of that society and \nat the same time open to the impulses and energies flowing from that wider \nlife\u201d (Jackson 1999: 105).  \n \nThe parallels with the quotation from T.S. Eliot, with which this paper opened, are \nobvious. Jackson, however, insists that \u201cbeing a social institution of this kind must \nmean being a market institution\u201d (1999: 105), but one senses that he is with Langslow \nwhen she says that, \u201c[u]niversities must be responsive to market forces but not \nderivative of them; they must interact with society but from a position of \ndifferentiation\u201d (Langslow 1999: 178, emphases added). \n \nBut this raises the key question \u2013 what, exactly, is it that differentiates universities \nfrom society? What are universities for? The same question is put by MacIntyre \u2013 \nwhat is a university community to answer when asked to \u201cjustify itself by specifying \nwhat its peculiar and essential function is, that function which, were it not to exist, no \nother institution could discharge\u201d? (MacIntyre 1990: 222). And MacIntyre\u201fs answer \nis this: \n \n\u201cthe response of this community ought to be that universities are places \nwhere conceptions of and standards of rational justification are elaborated, \nput to work in detailed practices of enquiry, and themselves rationally \nevaluated, so that only from the university can the wider society learn how \nto conduct its own debates, practical or theoretical, in a rationally defensible \nway\u201d (222). \n \nBut to be such an institution, the university has to be \u201ca place of constrained \ndisagreement, of imposed participation in conflict, in which a central responsibility of \nhigher education would be to initiate students into conflict\u201d (231). And in order to \nachieve this academics would need both to advance their own views and also enter \ninto controversy with other rival standpoints, and \u201cbe concerned to uphold and to \norder the ongoing conflicts, to provide institutionalised means for their expression \u2026 \nto ensure that rival voices were not illegitimately suppressed\u201d (231). Again there are \nparallels here with Oakeshott\u201fs notion of language (a manner of thinking), which is \nwhat a university education should be about, compared with literature (what has been \nsaid from time to time in a language), which is the end of vocational education but \nonly a means to the end of a university education (Oakeshott 1962: 308). \n \nMacIntyre does not think such universities exist, but argues instead that they have \nand that they should (MacIntyre 1990: 232). But there seems to be here a general \nconsensus that universities are, of their essence, very different kinds of institutions \n 12 \nfrom others in society (and notably from corporations). The universality of \nknowledge and its interconnections that should be represented and enabled within the \nuniversity (\u201cthinking with each other\u201d), the social nature of the institution as both part \nof wider society and, in an important sense, distinct from it, and the \ninstitutionalisation of constrained conflict mean that universities are essentially \nunlike other institutions \u2013 and need to remain so if they are to fulfil their role, the role \nwhich, were they not to exist, no other institution could discharge. \n \nIt might, of course, be argued that the pure (and possibly applied) sciences are not in \nthe same category as theology and philosophy \u2013 the disciplines that MacIntyre \nparticularly has in mind (1990: 232) \u2013 or other disciplines in the arts and humanities. \nKuhn\u201fs work on scientific paradigms (Kuhn 1996) and the increasingly obvious \ninterconnectedness of everything with everything, however, serve to discourage the \nnotion that parts of a university could claim exemption. \n \nIn this light, a code of ethics would seem to be the exact antithesis of how a university \nshould go about \u201cmanaging ethics\u201d. As noted above, a code tends to close down \nprecisely the debate that should be at the core of what a university is about (\u201c\u2026 in the \nrealm of professional practice matters which affect problems of immediate action \ncannot be allowed to go unsettled. One way or another codes must be formulated, \nchoices made, dilemmas resolved, with or without rational justification\u201d (MacIntyre \n1990: 226-227, cited above). The introduction of codes, then, might well have a \nsignificant and negative effect upon the very nature of the institutions they are \nattempting to assist. \n \n \nAn alternative suggestion \n \nIt is important to acknowledge that there was some discussion in the process of \nputting the Guide together about the nature of universities and \u201cgreat resistance to \n[them] being approached in the same way as corporations \u2013 for example, the \n\u201ebusiness case\u201f for ethics was unpopular partly because the term \u201ebusiness\u201f was \nunpalatable if applied to HEIs\u201d.5  But, as has been argued above, the outcome was \nnonetheless a proposal, endorsed by delegates at the June 2005 conference mentioned \nabove, that HEIs should introduce what amounts to a code with all the attendant \nimplementation measures. The assumption behind that proposal is that things that \ncorporations do (apparently whether they work or not) are transferable to HEIs, and \nthe prior assumption, as should now be clear, is that HEIs are not dissimilar in kind, \nas institutions, to corporations. \n \nIt is also interesting to note that the lack of an alternative comes into play at this \npoint. In the process of putting together the Guide \u201cother mechanisms were \nconsidered but the issue was what would happen without some kind of document? \nHow would coherence and consistency be ensured? Would anything get done?\u201d.6 \nHerein lies the difficulty \u2013 is it possible to rely, in effect, upon virtue, or is not some \nmeasure of governance necessary, with all the associated documentation, to ensure \nconsistency and make sure something gets done? \n \nBird & Waters (1989) may have something to offer here. In noting the \u201cmoral \nmuteness of managers\u201d in business organisations, and analysing its reasons, they \n 13 \noffer some suggestions for how this may be overcome. They argue that the role of \nsenior managers (the organisation\u201fs leaders)  \n \n\u201cin fostering \u2026 \u201cgood conversation\u201d among managers in an organization \ncannot be overemphasised. If they seek to provide moral leadership to an \norganization, senior managers must not only signal the importance they \nplace upon such conversations, but also demand that they take place. They \nneed also to build such conversations into the fabric of organizational life \nthrough management mechanisms such as requiring that managers include \nin their annual plans a statement of steps they will take to ensure that \nquestionable practices are reviewed \u2026\u201d (Bird & Waters 1989: 86). \n \nWhile the language of \u201cmanagers\u201d and \u201cannual plans\u201d may be somewhat alien to \nHEIs, the concepts of fostering good conversations and embedding them in \norganisational mechanisms are not difficult to assimilate. \n \nHere, then, is an alternative suggestion for how HEIs might \u201cmanage ethics\u201d: \n \n1. Rely primarily upon, and encourage, the integrity of staff and students; \n2. Reinforce among staff and students the institution\u201fs mission and values, \nensuring that the latter includes a high level, aspirational statement about \nmoral values as well as those to do more with \u201ewhat this organisation values\u201f \nsuch as research or teaching or making a contribution to the local community; \n3. Produce a statement which indicates that moral issues will inevitably arise in \nthe course of everyone\u201fs (staff and students) daily work including, and \nperhaps particularly, in the work of committees, and that these issues are to be \nacknowledged and openly discussed with colleagues and, where appropriate, \nmanagers; \n4. Expect senior and middle managers to \u201ewalk the talk\u201f by encouraging \u201cgood \nconversation\u201d; \n5. Institutionalise this \u201cthinking with each other\u201d by expecting particular issues \n(including \u201cquestionable practices\u201d) to be addressed in the form of written \nguidance, but only on a local or specific basis \u2013 research ethics being an \nobvious case in point; \n6. Occasionally audit current documentation to monitor what  exists in this \nregard; \n7. Appoint an ethics advisory committee, or widen the brief of an existing \ncommittee if necessary, to monitor and occasionally advise upon such specific \nissues; \n8. Do not necessarily expect that all moral issues will be capable of mutually \nacceptable resolution, but accept that the \u201cinstitutionalisation of constrained \nconflict\u201d is fundamental to the nature of universities. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nIt has been argued that the Guide\u201fs proposal, that HEIs should, in effect, introduce a \ncode of ethics with all the associated implementation measures, is not an appropriate \nway forward for HEIs. The evidence from the corporate sphere indicates that not only \nare such codes expensive and difficult to implement but that their effectiveness is \n 14 \ninconclusive. Why, therefore, should HEIs go down the corporate route? But more \nseriously, the introduction of such codes would undermine the very essence of such \ninstitutions, not only to their own detriment but also to that of society as a whole. \n \nAn alternative suggestion has been put forward, one that might be termed an \nembedded virtues approach, which relies primarily on the integrity of individuals \nwhile institutionalising such virtue in organisational mechanisms. This approach not \nonly facilitates moral imagination and \u201cgood conversation\u201d, encouraging staff and \nstudents toward the postconventional level of moral development, it also underlines \n(rather than undermines) the essential nature of such institutions. \n \nThe fact that HEFCE has continued its funding of the project that led to the Guide, \nwith five universities having received support to develop their response\n7\n (in effect, \npaying institutions to try it), and that CIHE is planning a review across the sector at \nthe end of 2006,\n8\n indicates that the issue is unlikely to go away. Nor should it. But the \nevidence presented here suggests that all this work, particularly if adopted across the \nsector, will not have much practical effect other than producing a lot of \ndocumentation \u2013 and, of course, providing an opportunity for research on ethics \ncodes in HEIs in a few years\u201f time. An interesting piece of research, however, (and \none that is also generally lacking in the corporate sphere) will be to compare those \ninstitutions which adopt codes with those that do not. \n \n \nFootnotes \n \n1.
