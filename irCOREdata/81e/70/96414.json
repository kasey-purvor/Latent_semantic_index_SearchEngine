We were also critical of the ECB for relying on the \nratings agencies to tell it which government bonds to accept on what terms. This, we \nargued, was an abdication of the ECB\u2019s responsibility to contribute to euro area \nstabilisation. \n \nThe van Rompuy Task Force has not addressed the issue of positive incentives at all, \nbut instead has returned to the disciplinarian language of the original Stability and \nGrowth Pact (SGP). In this contribution, we explain why we think its approach is \nflawed. Not only are the proposed sanctions likely to heighten political tensions, but \nalso the assessments on which they are based are likely to convict some governments \nof crimes they have not committed, while allowing others to pursue policies that \nworsen the euro area\u2019s growth prospects. We then take another look at the curious \npolitics of the ECB. The crisis has seen the boundaries between monetary and fiscal \npolicy crossed in several member states: most strikingly in Ireland. As a result, the \nECB has been dragged into country-specific measures. We suggest that this will be a \npermanent feature of its life from now on, and it needs to find ways to use its \ninfluence constructively. Finally, we turn to the debate over the crisis resolution \nmechanism (CRM) and argue for once in defence of the German position. Requiring \ncreditors to take a haircut when a country has recourse to the CRM could actually \nmean that the markets finally come to provide timely signals to governments that are \npursuing unsustainable policies. \n \nThe errors in the proposed SGP reforms \nThe Task Force solemnly proposes a return to the disciplinarian approach that \nprevailed before 2005. The Task Force wants more and earlier sanctions, namely for \nan excessive deficit, debt, and imbalances. The new decision mechanism in the \nCouncil also makes it more likely that such sanctions will be imposed, as it no longer \nrequires a qualified majority to confirm the recommendation by the Commission but a \nqualified majority to reject it (a so-called reverse majority). In the future, sanctions \nmay be extended to non-Euro area members although they will not have to pay a fine \nbut may not receive certain funds from the EU budget (Task Force 2010: para 18). No \ndoubt many small dramas will be enacted under these rules. They will do nothing to \nremedy the economic problems of the euro area and they will also harm the popular \nlegitimacy of the Commission, which will be clearly responsible, as never before, for \npunitive actions towards member states.  \n \nFor the drafters of the original SGP, irresponsible governments were the most \nimportant potential source of macroeconomic instability, and fiscal deficits and debt \nwere the key data to be monitored if the euro area was to thrive. We now know that \nthis led to what statisticians call Type 2 errors. Fiscal monitoring did not reveal the \nthreats to macroeconomic stability that were bubbling up as the peripheral euro area \ncountries enjoyed the effects of low interest rates. Spain, for example, performed \nadequately on the fiscal criteria, whereas stresses might have been identified if \nmacroeconomic monitoring had paid more attention to private debt and current \naccount imbalances. Conversely, fiscal monitoring could lead to type 1 errors or \nfinding a problem where there was not one. Belgium, a persistently poor fiscal \nperformer, provides the leading example of that: it has a solid current account surplus \nand, before the crisis, managed to use lower euro interest rates to reduce its debt level \nslowly but surely. \n \nThus the Task Force is right to propose to monitor the \u2018excessive imbalances position\u2019 \nof member states (Task Force 2010: para 37). The list of indicators for such excessive \nimbalances has not been drawn up yet but the report mentions \u2018[c]onsumption \ndevelopments, housing bubbles[,] the accumulation of external and internal debt\u2019 and \n\u2018divergences in competitiveness\u2019 (Task Force 2010: para 32). So it seems that a lesson \nhas been learned. But the disciplinarian fervour is yet again prone to rely on irrelevant \nevidence, thereby convicting governments of failures of macroeconomic management \nwhen they are not, in any meaningful sense, guilty. \n \nThe most striking source of potential type 1 errors is the suggestion that \ncompetitiveness should be monitored. Macroeconomic monitoring should be \nconcerned with indicators that can be tackled with macroeconomic policies. Unit \nlabour costs (the proposed measure of competitiveness) are a composite indicator of \nnominal wage developments and the evolution of employment (hours worked) relative \nto output. Governments could intervene to manipulate this measure but it is far from \nclear that they should and that they even can in any predictable way. In the capitalist \nmarket economies of the euro area, it is for firms and wage bargainers to determine \nthese variables in the course of searching for profitable business and employment \nstrategies, through their negotiations over wages and working time. \n \nThe Task Force proposes monitoring \u2018imbalances\u2019, but it is clear that it really means \n\u2018deficits\u2019. Member states with large and persistent current-account surpluses are \nmentioned only once, in para 33, where it is suggested that their \u2018policies should aim \nto identify and implement the structural reforms that help strengthening their domestic \ndemand and growth potential.\u2019 One cannot but wonder what these structural reforms \nmight be: the demolition of the model of export-oriented growth and accompanying \nwage restraint that is apparently so deeply institutionalised in Germany, the \nNetherlands and Austria, perhaps? Seriously, structural reforms are an unreliable way \nto boost domestic demand and will actually make the problem of imbalances harder. \nThe tax cuts that liberal-conservative governments in Germany and the Netherlands \nfavour might do the trick, and perhaps more spending on social services would not go \namiss. But of course this cannot be said, because the official EU line is to preach the \ndoctrine of universal fiscal consolidation, for everybody to read in the Commission\u2019s \nassessments of stability and convergence programmes. This advice may be right for \nany one country looked at in isolation but it is not constructive advice against the \nbackground of large macroeconomic imbalances within the Euro area.  \n \nIt would be much better to convince the governments of surplus countries that it is in \ntheir own interest to allow the debtors repay instead of competing them into the abyss. \nThe surplus countries\u2019 banks and pension funds would then be on the line as well, \nsince they hold a good share of the sovereign debt. To suppose that the surpluses of \none group of countries are caused by good fiscal policy and the deficits of the other \ngroup are due to bad fiscal policy is to commit both type 2 and type 1 errors at the \nsame time. The surplus countries are deemed innocent of responsibility; the deficit \ncountries found guilty. This is an achievement of sorts, as statisticians tell us that the \noccurrence of these errors normally varies inversely. \n \nThe ECB\u2019s role in the crisis saga \nThe monitoring of current account positions will reveal that fiscal authorities are not \nthe only force behind unsustainable imbalances. Attention will shift to the growth of \nprivate debt and booms in bank lending on the back of housing bubbles. As \neconomists noted long before the crisis, national governments in the Euro area have \nonly fiscal instruments to deal with these problems. Tax policies can certainly have an \nimpact on how attractive it is to incur mortgage debt; property taxes or windfall gains \ntaxes on housing transactions could also help to restrain bubbles. But it is now clear \nthat action should also be taken by monetary authorities. Macroeconomic stability is a \nmonetary as well as a fiscal task. Paul De Grauwe (2010) has recently proposed that \nthe ECB should accept its responsibility for asset market bubbles and impose, for \ninstance, country-specific minimum reserve requirements on resident banks. Of \ncourse, the ECB will resist the use of country-specific assessments and instruments \nrather than general interest rate policy, as this will expose it to a much higher level of \npolitical debate.  \n \nOne lesson of the financial crisis is that not just governments but also banks can \npursue unsustainable strategies. The model of governance of the euro area, by \ncontrast, was based on the assumption that member states\u2019 commercial banks were all \nequally sound institutions, managed according to common banking principles. We \nnow know that national differences in banking regulation can have a profound impact \non euro area stability. Regulators could monitor the strategies by which banks are \nincreasing their leverage, restrain the erosion of loan-to-value ratios and control the \nspread of securitisation. They could also rein in loans to housing and construction that \nare based on overvalued collateral.  \n \nThe ECB is already pursuing country-specific policies. This became apparent in a \nrather peculiar way when the ECB chose to settle unease about Greece\u2019s declining \ncredit rating by announcing its continued willingness to purchase Greek bonds as part \nof its own version of quantitative easing. Now, the Irish crisis has revealed another \nrole, as it has become clear that ECB loans are supporting the Irish banking system to \na much greater extent than in any other country. So long as the imperative of \nmaintaining liquidity reigned, this was just a small wrinkle on the ECB\u2019s generally \nexpansionary stance. But with recovery now underway in the heart of Europe, the \nECB will want to rein in its asset purchases and lending.  \n \nThe deliberations of the van Rompuy Task Force, with its huffing and puffing about \nfiscal discipline, are strikingly orthogonal to the Irish problem. The Irish government \ncannot be accused of profligacy in regular government spending; if anything, the \ngovernment has sent the economy into a downward spiral thanks to its pro-cyclical \nausterity programme. Until recently, markets praised the Irish government for doing \nall the things that the Greek government should do. The crucial step that Ireland took \ntowards insolvency was to turn bank debts into sovereign debts, by promising to \nguarantee the position of bank creditors. While tough on public sector workers and \nbenefit recipients, the government has been lenient towards its political cronies in the \nbanking and building sectors.  \n \nThe crisis makes it clear now that the Irish government must make creditors share the \nlosses of insolvent banks, or the resulting burden on Irish taxpayers will burden the \neconomy for years. Such burden-sharing is arguably what the Commission has tried to \ndo by forcing Ireland to turn to the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) \nand the IMF. This intervention saw officials from outside Ireland trying to impose a \nsolution in the interests of taxpayers rather than the political elite, which is naturally \ndevoted to its \u2018sovereignty\u2019.  \n \nA standby agreement would also end the present situation where the ECB is abused as \na printing press to prop up the Irish banking system. It is a bitter irony and a damning \nverdict on the past strategy that this humiliation is inflicted upon the proudly \nindependent central bank by a member state which accepts that its sovereignty is \nceded to market forces rather than shared with the union of which it is a member. Like \nthe ECB, the Irish government prefers to let its actions be dictated by the markets \nrather than take advice from other political authorities. \n \nCrisis resolution \nThe one bright spot in these depressing stories is the possibility of a crisis resolution \nmechanism, not contained in the Task Force report but apparently under preparation \non the request of the French and German governments. This mechanism provides an \nopportunity to correct the process whereby the financial markets create debt crises \nwhich member states can only calm by offering assurances of no default. The German \nvision is that the crisis resolution mechanism will see haircuts imposed on the national \ndebt of member states that enter it. This should ensure that markets price in the risks \nof debt being discounted at a much earlier stage than they do now. If markets \ncorrectly assessed risk, countries pursuing irresponsible fiscal policies should find \nthemselves facing an interest rate premium: a more salient and effective deterrent than \nany excessive deficit procedure.  \n \nThe SGP as it stands prevents rather than supports this deterrent from operating. \nIntrusive fiscal surveillance inevitably declares budgetary policies to be a common \nresponsibility and however much Commission and Council insist on the no-bailout \nclause, the markets see the common responsibility \u2013 why else would members accept \nthe intrusion? At the same time, there is no fiscal substance behind this common \nresponsibility, no central budget that could protect a government from being forced to \nausterity when the economy is already in the doldrums.   \n \nBut it would be preferable and in our view even more effective if the markets would \nimpose the haircuts on themselves. This calls for some innovation in public debt \nmanagement. But then these unusual times are the right times for making the case for \nunorthodox measures, as monetary authorities have taught us. Robert Shiller (2005) \nhas proposed to link returns on public debt to GDP growth. Bulgaria has already \nexperimented with such bond issue. It would mean that if bond markets drive an \neconomy into recession, the burden of servicing the public debt would fall as well. \nThis would make for a smoother pricing in of evolving risks to which countries can \nadjust instead of being pushed into crisis and towards default. Such a mechanism is \nnot a silver bullet but would help to suppress the destabilizing dynamic of high \ninterest rates and low growth.  \n \nReferences: \nDe Grauwe, P.
