Introduction\nAsian options, whose payoff is based on the arithmetic average\nR T\n0 Sudu\nT\nof the\nunderlying equity price St over a given period of time (0, T ), have known a very large\nsuccess over the past years. Although the valuation of these options in the Black and\nScholes framework has triggered the interest of financial mathematicians for over a\ndecade in an intricate interplay between theoretical ( Yor [40], Geman and Yor [41],\nSchro\u00a8der [36], Milevsky and Posner [28], [32], Dufresne [16], etc. ) and computational (\nCaverhill and Clewlow [6], Fu et al [18], Rogers and Shi [34], Zvan [42], Vecer [38], etc.\n) approaches, the pricing of such options under alternative models has not been much\nexplored so far, with the noticeable exception of Andreasen [1] for jump-diffusions and\nVecer and Xu [39], very recently, for a general treatment of semi-martingale models in\nterms of integro-differential equations. The square-root process offers a very tractable\nmathematical structure, which enables simple pricing of important exotic options in\nexplicit form. This has, for example, been highlighted by Lo et al [26] in the case of\nbarrier options (analysis extended by Davydov and Linetsky [13] and [14] for constant\nelasticity of variance models). In the case of Asian options, although little attention has\nbeen paid to this in the literature, the additivity property of the square-root process\nmakes it a specially well-suited model for pricing options on arithmetic averages. We\nshow in this paper that the square-root process leads to simple explicit expressions for\nAsian options prices, unlike in the Black and Scholes framework.\nThe popularity of the square-root process in all main branches of financial modeling\ncan be explained by its desirable property of positivity and its richness of behaviour. As\na result, it has been used to model equities ( Cox-Ross [10] alternative process), interest\nrates ( CIR [9] interest rate model and its time-inhomogeneous [27], multivariate [7] and\nother derivatives) , stochastic volatility ( Heston [22] model and its various extensions\n[2], [15], [30]) and other financial quantities. In this paper, we will focus on the Cox-Ross\nform of the process used for modelling equities\ndSt = rStdt+ \u03c3\n\u221a\nStdWt (1)\nand on its temporal integral Yt =\n\u222b t\n0\nSudu. The corresponding analysis for the mean-\nreverting form\ndXt = (a\u2212 bXt)dt+ \u03c3\n\u221a\nXtdWt (2)\nand its temporal integral can be found in our companion paper [12] although some of\nthe results presented here are valid+ for both forms (2) and (1). The Cox-Ross model\nwas first proposed as an alternative to the Black-Scholes model, exhibiting a specific\nstochastic volatility. The instantaneous variance of the percentage price change \u03c3\n2\nSt\nis an\ninverse function of the stock price. Along with the square-root model, Cox and Ross\n( [10] and [8]) also introduced a class of processes, the constant elasticity of variance\n+ Results valid for both forms will be quoted in terms of X whereas results specific to the equity form\n(1) will be quoted in terms of S.\nprocesses, sharing similar properties. Numerous subsequent studies proved the empi-\nrical adequacy of these models to stock prices movements as well as to the pricing of\nEuropean ( Beckers [4], Schro\u00a8der [35]) and exotic ( Boyle and Tian [5], Davydov and\nLinetsky [13] ) derivatives. The square-root equity model on its own has raised the\ninterest of researchers ( see Lo et al [26], Hauser and Lauterbach [21]).\nIn order to evaluate Asian derivatives, we first study the distributional properties\nof the process. After recalling some important properties of the square-root process in\nthe second section, we proceed to derive the joint moments of (XT , YT ) in the third\none. By solving a triangular set of partial differential equations, we prove that these\nmoments take a simple explicit form, which can be practical. Those moments have\nindeed an important informational content, since they are proven to actually determine\nthe distribution of these processes and are needed for moments-base expansions of the\nLaguerre type [16]. In the fourth section, we also derive the joint distribution of the\nprocess and its integral by analytic Laplace transform inversion, using a simplifying\nmeasure change relating the square-root process to a time-changed square Bessel process.\nIn the fifth section, we apply these results to the pricing of fixed-strike Asian option and\ntest the numerical behaviour of these results in the last and sixth section. The formulae\nderived for these prices take the form of very fast converging series, which proves to be\nnot only faster but also more robust than numerical Laplace inversion in regions of high\nmaturities and volatilities. They are also more suited to systematic implementation, as\nwill be explained later.\n2. The square-root process: some reminders\nFor any positive initial value S0, there is a unique strong solution to the stochastic\ndifferential equation (1) and as S is positive, Y is positive and increasing. The\njoint distribution of (ST , YT ) can be characterised by its moment generating function\nE\n(\ne\u2212\u03bbXte\u2212\u00b5\nR t\n0 Xudu|X0 = x0\n)\n(see Lamberton and Lapeyre [23] for instance) for the\ngeneral form (2)). As mentioned earlier, it is the additivity of the process which plays\na key role in the derivation of this simple MGF. Indeed, the MGF, as a function of the\ntime and the initial value, follows the partial differential equation\n\u2202L\u02dca,x0\n\u2202t\n=\n\u03c32\n2\nx\n\u22022L\u02dca,x0\n\u22022x2\n+ (a\u2212 bx)\u2202L\u02dc\na,x0\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u00b5xL\u02dca,x0 (3)\nsubject to the initial condition\nL\u02dca,x0(0, x) = e\u2212\u03bbx\nThe additivity property, corollary of the additivity property of the square Bessel\nprocesses ( see Revuz and Yor [33]), states that the sum of two independent square-root\nprocesses with the coefficients a1 and a2, the initial values x\n1\n0 and x\n2\n0 respectively and\nthe same \u03c3 and b is another square-root process with the coefficient a1 + a2, the initial\nvalue x10 + x\n2\n0 and the same \u03c3 and b. This implies that L\u02dc\na,x0 = L\u02dc0,x0L\u02dca,0 by convolution.\nThe scaling property of the process, on the other hand, leads to the form L\u02dc0,x0 = e\u2212a\u03c6\nand L\u02dc0,x0 = e\u2212x0\u03c8 where \u03c6 and \u03c8 are some positive functions of the others parameters.\nThe additivity property thus leads to the fundamental decomposition L\u02dca,x0 = e\u2212x0\u03c8\u2212a\u03c6.\nUsing this functional form in the partial differential equation (3) transforms it into two\nsimple coupled ordinary differential equations, one being a Ricatti equation and the\nother a direct differentiation equation. Simplifying to the equity case (1) and solving\nfor the Ricattti equation gives the following expressions, where we change the notation\nL\u02dc0,s0 to LS,Y (\u03bb, \u00b5) to emphasise the importance of the MGF arguments \u00b5 and \u03bb.\nLS,Y (\u03bb, \u00b5) = E\n(\ne\u2212\u03bbSte\u2212\u00b5\nR t\n0 Sudu|S0 = s0\n)\n= e\u2212s0\u03c8 (4)\nwith\n\u03c8 =\n\u03bb((\u03b3 \u2212 b) + e\u2212\u03b3t(\u03b3 + b)) + 2\u00b5(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3t)\n\u03c32\u03bb(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3t) + (\u03b3 + b) + e\u2212\u03b3t(\u03b3 \u2212 b) (5)\nand\n\u03b3 =\n\u221a\nb2 + 2\u00b5\u03c32 (6)\nThis result stemming from the additivity of the square-root process is the core from\nwhich we will derive our new results concerning the distribution of (S, Y ). The transform\nLS,Y (\u03bb, \u00b5) perfectly characterises the distribution. However, it is desirable to obtain\ndensities and moments in as simple a form as possible for practical purposes such as\nparameters estimation or derivative pricing. This is the object of the following section.\n3. Joint moments\nThe first quantities of interest when studying a random variable are its moments.\nIn the literature concerning stochastic volatility, the moments of the average YT\nT\nhave\nbeen used either to compute approximations for option prices (see Ball and Roma [3])\nor to gain insight in the distribution of the stock (see Das [11]). However, only the\nfour first moments have been given in these texts since they were computed through\nsuccessive differentiation of the moment-generating function. Although it is theoretically\npossible to obtain all these moments through repeated differentiation, this method\nremains tedious and even with formal calculus packages like Mathematica or Maple,\nonly the first ones can be handled in this quite time-consuming way. We show here that\nit is actually possible to obtain all of them analytically, since it turns out that they have\na relatively simple form.\nIn the case of the square-root process and its integral, moments convey total\ninformation since they determine the joint distribution. Indeed, the function equal\nto the joint MGF for positive \u03bb and \u00b5, i.e. the rightmost part of equation (4), is\nanalytic for a range of negative values. From Beppo Levi\u2019s theorem, the MGF, written\nas the expectation of an entire series, converges monotonically to and coincides with\nthe analytic function in (4) inside this range of negative values. Therefore, knowing the\njoint moments of (Xt, Yt) is equivalent to knowing their joint distribution.\nThe following results concerning the joint moments of (Xt, Yt) are general and also\nvalid for the mean-reverting form. For this section, we hence use the parametrisation of\n(2).\nTheorem 3.1. The joint moments of Xt and Yt are given by\nMm,n(t) = E(Y\nm\nt X\nn\u2212m\nt ) =\nn\u2211\nj=0\ne\u2212jbt\n( Im,nj\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1\nm,n\nj,i\nti\u22121\n(i\u2212 1)!\n)\n(7)\nwhere\nI\nm,n\nj = min(n + 1\u2212 j,m + 1) (8)\nThe coefficients \u03b1m,nj,i can be obtained by recursion through the relations\n\u2022 For j 6= n\u2212m\n\u03b1\nm,n\nj,i = m\nI\nm\u22121,n\nj\u2211\ni\u2032=i\n(\u22121)i\u2032\u2212i\u03b1m\u22121,nj,i\u2032\n((n\u2212m\u2212 j)b)i\u2032\u2212i+1\n+(n\u2212m)\n(\na + (n\u2212m\u2212 1)\u03c3\n2\n2\n) Im,n\u22121j\u2211\ni\u2032=i\n(\u22121)i\u2032\u2212i\u03b1m,n\u22121j,i\u2032\n((n\u2212m\u2212 j)b)i\u2032\u2212i+1 (9)\n\u2022 For j = n\u2212m\n\u25e6 For i = 1\n\u03b1\nm,n\nn\u2212m,1 = cm,n +m\nn\u2211\nj=0\nI\nm\u22121,n\nn\u2212m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1\nm\u22121,n\nj,i\n((j \u2212 n+m)b)i\n+(n\u2212m)\n(\na + (n\u2212m\u2212 1)\u03c3\n2\n2\n) n\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nI\nm,n\u22121\nn\u2212m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1\nm,n\u22121\nj,i\n((j \u2212 n +m)b)i (10)\n\u25e6 For i > 1\n\u03b1\nm,n\nn\u2212m,i = m\u03b1\nm\u22121,n\nn\u2212m,i\u22121 + (n\u2212m)\n(\na + (n\u2212m\u2212 1)\u03c3\n2\n2\n)\n\u03b1\nm,n\u22121\nn\u2212m,i\u22121 (11)\nwhere\ncm,n = r\nn\n0 1{m=0} (12)\n\u2022 Initial condition\n\u03b1\n0,0\n0,1 = 1 (13)\nProof. Assessing first the issue of existence, the joint MGF (see Lamberton and Lapeyre\n[23] for the general case) is infinitely differentiable in a neighbourhood of (0, 0), implying\nthe joint moments of Xt and Yt exist for any positive order for any finite t.\nTherefore,\ndE(Y mt X\nk\nt )\ndt\n= mE(Y m\u22121t X\nk+1\nt ) + akE(Y\nm\nt X\nk\u22121\nt )\n\u2212bkE(Y mt Xkt ) + k(k \u2212 1)\n\u03c32\n2\nE(Y mt X\nk\u22121\nt ) (14)\nIt should be noticed that the computation of positive order moments does not actually\ninvolve the moments of the reciprocals of either Xt or Yt.\nDenoting M\u0302m,n(\u03b6) the Laplace transform of Mm,n(t) = E(Y\nm\nt X\nn\u2212m\nt ) with respect\nto time for \u03b6 \u2208 R+, M\u0302m,n(\u03b6) =\n\u222b\u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03b6tMm,n(t)dt , the ordinary differential equation\n(14) becomes\nM\u0302m,n(\u03b6)[\u03b6 + b(n\u2212m)]\u2212Mm,n(0) = mM\u0302m\u22121,n(\u03b6) + d(n,m)M\u0302m,n\u22121(\u03b6)(15)\nwith\nd(n,m) = (n\u2212m)\n(\na + (n\u2212m\u2212 1)\u03c3\n2\n2\n)\n(16)\n(7) can then be shown through induction, assuming that for a given n > 0 and for all\nintegers m < n, the joint moments have the form\nM\u0302m,n =\nn\u2211\nj=0\nI\nm,n\nj\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1\nm,n\nj,i\n(\u03b6 + jb)i\n(17)\nThe inversion then comes from the classical result\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03b6t\u2212jbt\nti\u22121\n(i\u2212 1)!dt =\n1\n(\u03b6 + jb)i\nThe mathematical importance of those moments along with their appealing form\nmake them a useful tool as they allow us to state explicitly the density and other\nfunctionals and expectations in an analytical form with methods like Laguerre series (\nsee Dufresne [16]).\n4. Laplace transform inversion and density\nThe moments-based expansion methods that can be derived from the results of the\nprevious section remain quite general and their actual efficiency depends on the specific\ndistribution. In the following, we will derive a series representation for this density\nby exploiting a change of measure relating the square-root process to a square-Bessel\nprocess. Although moments-based expansions remain useful for complex payoff, this\nseries representation is valuable and simpler for pricing options with simple payoff like\ncall or put options. Just like the square-root process density is an infinite weighted\naverage of gamma densities (see Feller [17]), this density will be represented in a series\nform.\nTheorem 4.1. Under the measure Q\u2217 given by the Radon-Nykodim derivative dQ\n\u2217\ndQ\n=\nL(T ), with L(t) = e\nb2Yt\n2\u03c32\n+\nb(Xt\u2212x0)\n\u03c32\n\u2212abt\n\u03c32 , the process X(t) is a.s. proportional to a square\nBessel process\ndXt = adt + \u03c3\n\u221a\nXtdW\n\u2217\nt (18)\nW \u2217t being a Brownian motion under the Q\n\u2217\u2212measure.

Girsanov\u2019s theorem then implies that the process W \u2217 defined by W \u2217t = Wt \u2212\u222b t\n0\nb\n\u03c3\n\u221a\nXudWu is a Brownian motion under Q\n\u2217.\nIf X might also be connected with Bessel processes through other transformations,\nthe change of measure proposed here is a simple result, easy to manipulate and suited\nto the analysis of the path-dependent integral Yt, which requires path properties to be\nexploitable.

A\nsquare-root process with comparable parameters would be S0 = 100, a = 0, b = \u22120.05\nand \u03c3 = 2. With this choice of parameters, Figure 1 draws the joint density surface of\n(X1, Y1) when no absorption occurred.\nFor the same reference parameters values, we observe how the speed of convergence\nis affected by the variation of some key-parameters. Basically, this evolution is coherent\nwith our previous remark highlighting that the main leading term is e\u2212\n\u03c32t2\n2y\nn2 . In the\nfollowing tables, N represents the number of terms needed for the absolute difference]\nbetween the limit (series truncated at 50 terms) and the series truncated at N terms or\nmore to be less than 10\u22124.\nWe thus observe in Table 1 that N increases with y and the evolution is indeed\nrather quadratic than linear in N.\nFor increasing volatilities (y = E(Y1) \u2248 102.54), the decrease in N is also\npronounced in Table 2.\nTo observe the evolution with t, a better understanding of the series behaviour can\nbe obtained by studying the density at the moving point y = E(Yt) = X0\nert\u22121\nr\n, which\nexhibits the expected increase in speed (Table 3).\n] We prefer holding the absolute difference as the stopping criteria rather than the relative difference,\nsince the density can reach values quite close to 0.\nJoint density of the square-root process and its temporal integral\nFigure 1.

Fixed-strike Asian options.\nTable 4 collects the moments of E(YT\nT\n), the intrinsic values and the prices of the\nAsian call options both for the square-root process (SR) and the geometric Brownian\nmotion case (BS), the latter having been computing by numerical integration using the\nexplicit formulae derived in Linetsky [24]. N represents the number of terms needed\nfor the error to be inferior to 10\u22124. Two points spring to the eyes from this table.\nFirstly, the series converges very rapidly for a broad range of cases. Secondly, the prices\nobtained for the square-root process are quite close to the Black and Scholes Asian ones.\nThe differences between the models are to be computed in basis points rather than in\npercents, except in cases 3 and 6. The greater differences appearing in these two cases\ncould be accounted for by the relatively greater importance of the tails there as the\nsynthetic parameter \u03c3\n\u221a\nT becomes very small for case 3 and quite large for case 6.\nThe series converges more and more rapidly as T or \u03c3 increase. This can be seen\nfrom Table 5 and Table 6. The results were cross-tested against two numerical Laplace\ninversion. We observed that these numerical inversion algorithms get strained and even\nbecome unreliable and unstable as the volatility or the maturity increase.\nr \u03c3 T K S0 Moment Intrinsic Option N\n0.05 0.71 0.1 2 2 1.9950 0.0050 0.0751 30\n0.05 0.71 0.5 2 2 1.9752 0.0246 0.1725 7\n0.05 0.71 1 2 2 1.9508 0.0484 0.2468 5\n0.05 0.71 2 2 2 1.9033 0.0936 0.3339 3\n0.05 0.71 5 2 2 1.7696 0.2120 0.3733 2\nTable 5.

The series converges\nslowly for small \u03c3. But for too tiny \u03c3, as nothing can really happen for such values, the\nput option is almost worthless and the series converges in one term.\nWe finally analyse the evolution with respect to the strike K. Table 7 shows results\nin agreement with our observations concerning the series representing the joint density.\nIn fact, all the results obtained here corroborate the observations and comments related\nto the effect of the different parameters on the speed of convergence. This is due to the\nfact that the leading term remains the same.\nr \u03c3 T K S0 Moment Intrinsic Option N\n0.05 0.71 1 1 2 1.9508 0.9996 1.0017 2\n0.05 0.71 1 1.5 2 1.9508 0.5240 0.5644 4\n0.05 0.71 1 2 2 1.9508 0.0484 0.2468 5\n0.05 0.71 1 2.5 2 1.9508 -0.4273 0.0822 6\n0.05 0.71 1 3 2 1.9508 -0.9029 0.0210 8\nTable 7. Evolution with the strike.\n7. Conclusion\nThis paper provides simple analytical pricing formulae for fixed-strike arithmetic Asian\noptions under the square-root process. Before any comparison concerning the actual\nnumerical performance of our series representations, it should be highlighted that these\nformulae have the first advantage over numerical Laplace inversion that they can be\nused for systematic implementation. Indeed, the numerical Laplace inversion methods\ndepend sometimes critically on free parameters whose optimal values can vary according\nto the problem parameters values. Moreover, analysing the numerical evaluation of this\nseries, we found them very rapidly convergent in general but also more specially for large\nvolatilities and maturities. As these formulae turn out to be simpler than in the Black\nand Scholes model, this approach is not only interesting on its own as a mean to capture\nthe prices under this alternative model constituted by the square-root process but it can\nalso be used as a benchmark to test against the numerics of the Black and Scholes model.\nAs a final remark, it should be noticed that the valuation of floating-strike Asian options\ncan also be derived from our results.\nAppendix\nTo present the formulae for man(K, \u03bb, i, j) and m\np\nn(K, \u03bb, i, j), we first need to define the\nfollowing expressions.\nIDefinitions and notations.\nWith the parameters D\u03be = \u2212 r\u03c32 \u2212 \u03be2 and C\u02dc =\n\u221a\n2\npi\n1\u221a\n2K\u03b1\ne\n(S0+(n+1)\u03c3\n2T )\u03be\n2 , we build\ntwo multiply-indexed series G and M , M being built from another series B\u02dc with the\nfollowing procedure.\n\u2022 Induction rules\n\u25e6 For Mp,q,n,\nMp,q,n(\u03be,K) =\n\u221a\n2\npi\ne\u2212\u03be\n2K\u03b1\n\u221a\n2K\u03b1\np+q+3 B\u02dcp,q\u22121,n(K)\u2212 \u03beMp,q\u22121,n(\u03be,K) (A.1)\n\u25e6 For B\u02dcp,q,n,\nB\u02dcp,q,n(K) =\n{\n1{p=0}\n[\nHeq+2\n(S0 + (n+ 1)\u03c32T\n2\n\u221a\n2K\u03b1\n)\ne\u2212\n(S0+(n+1)\u03c3\n2T )2\n16K\u03b1\n]\n+pB\u02dcp\u22121,q,n(K) +\nr\n\u03c32\nB\u02dcp,q\u22121,n(K)\n}\n2\n\u221a\n2K\u03b1 (A.2)\n\u25e6 For Gp,n(\u03be,K),\nGp,n(\u03be,K) =\n\u221a\n2\npi\ne\u2212\u03be\n2K\u03b1\n\u221a\n2K\u03b1\np+1Hep\n(S0 + nT\u03c32\n2\n\u221a\n2K\u03b1\n)\ne\u2212\n(S0+nT\u03c3\n2)2\n16K\u03b1\n\u2212\u03beGp\u22121,n(\u03be,K) (A.3)\n\u25e6 For DMp,q,n,\nDMp,q,n(\u03be,K) = \u22124K\u03b1\nr\nMp,q+1,n(\u03be,K)\u2212 2(p+ q + 3)\nr\nMp,q\u22121,n(\u03be,K)\n+(\nS0 + (n+ 1)\u03c3\n2T \u2212 4K\u03b1\u03be\nr\n)Mp,q,n(\u03be,K) +\n1\nr\nMp+1,q\u22121,n(\u03be,K) (A.4)\n\u25e6 For DGp,n,\nDGp,n(\u03be,K) = \u2212Gp\u22121,n(\u03be, y)\u2212 \u03be.DGp\u22121,n(\u03be,K)\n\u22122K\u03bee\u2212\u03be2K\u03b1\n\u221a\n2\npi\n\u03b1\u221a\n2K\u03b1\np+1Hep(\nS0 + nT\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u221a\n2K\u03b1\n)e\u2212\n(S0+nT\u03c3\n2)2\n16K\u03b1 (A.5)\n\u2022 Initialisations\n\u25e6 For Mp,\u2212p\u22123,n,\n\u2217 If \u03be 6= \u2212 2r\n\u03c32\n,\nMp,\u2212p\u22123,n(\u03be,K) =\np\nD\u03be\nMp\u22121,\u2212p\u22122,n(\u03be,K)\u2212 C\u02dc2D\u03be B\u02c7p,n(D\u03be, K)\nM0,\u22123,n(\u03be,K) = C\u02dc2D\u03be (B\u02c70,n(0, K)\u2212 B\u02c70,n(D\u03be, K))\n(A.6)\n\u2217 If \u03be = \u2212 2r\n\u03c32\n,\nMp,\u2212p\u22123,n\n(\n\u2212 2r\n\u03c32\n, K\n)\n=\nC\u02dc\n2\n1\np + 1\nB\u02c7p+1,n(0, K) (A.7)\n\u25e6 For B\u02dcp,\u2212p\u22123,n,\nB\u02dcp,\u2212p\u22123,n(K) = \u2212\n(\nS0 + (n+ 1)\u03c3\n2T \u2212 8K\u03b1 r\n\u03c32\n)\nB\u02dcp\u22121,\u2212p\u22122,n(K)\n+8K\u03b1\n{\n1{p=1}e\u2212\n(S0+(n+1)\u03c3\n2T )2\n16K\u03b1 + (p\u2212 1)B\u02dcp\u22122,\u2212p\u22121,n(K)\n}\n(A.8)\nand\nB\u02dc0,\u22123,n(K) = (2\n\u221a\npiK\u03b1)erfc\n(S0 + (n+ 1)\u03c32T \u2212 8K\u03b1 r\u03c32\n4\n\u221a\nK\u03b1\n)\n(A.9)\n\u25e6 For the additional initialising terms B\u02c7p,n(D\u03be, K),\nB\u02c7p,n(D\u03be, K) = \u2212(S0 + (n+ 1)\u03c32T + 4K\u03b1(\u03be + 2D\u03be))B\u02c7p\u22121,n(D\u03be, K)\n+8K\u03b1\n{\n1{p=1}e\n\u2212 (S0+(n+1)\u03c3\n2T+4K\u03b1\u03be)2\n16K\u03b1 + (p\u2212 1)B\u02c7p\u22122,n(D\u03be, K)\n}\n(A.10)\nand\nB\u02c70,n(D\u03be, K) = (2\n\u221a\npiK\u03b1)erfc\n(S0 + (n + 1)\u03c32T + 4K\u03b1(\u03be + 2D\u03be)\n4\n\u221a\nK\u03b1\n)\n(A.11)\n\u25e6 For G\u22121,n(\u03be,K),\nG\u22121,n(\u03be,K) =\n(\ne\n(S0+nT\u03c3\n2)\u03be\n2\n)\nerfc\n(S0 + nT\u03c32 + 4K\u03b1\u03be\n4\n\u221a\nK\u03b1\n)\n(A.12)\n\u25e6 For DMp,\u2212p\u22123,n,\nDMp,\u2212p\u22123,n(\u03be,K) =\nS0 + (n+ 1)\u03c3\n2T\nr\nMp,\u2212p\u22123,n(\u03be,K)\n+\n1\nr\nMp+1,\u2212p\u22124,n(\u03be,K)\u2212 4K\u03b1\nr\nC\u02dcB\u02c7p,n(D\u03be, K) (A.13)\n\u25e6 For DG\u22121,n,\nDG\u22121,n(\u03be,K) =\n\u221a\n2\npi\ne\nS0+nT\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u03bee\u2212\n(S0+nT\u03c3\n2+4K\u03b1\u03be)2\n16K\u03b1\n+\nS0 + nT\u03c3\n2\n2\n(e\nS0+nT\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u03be)erfc(\nS0 + nT\u03c3\n2 + 4K\u03b1\u03be\n4\n\u221a\nK\u03b1\n) (A.14)\nIThe actual representation.\nWe list below the cases needed for the valuation of the quantities given in Theorem\n5.2.\n\u0007 Case i = 0, j = 0 This case was actually partly treated in Theorem 4.2 for the\nabsorption case.
