There is now broad scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions related\nto human activities are responsible for the increase in atmospheric temperatures recorded\nsince the middle of the nineteenth century. Sustained economic growth since the industrial\nrevolution has gone hand in hand with an increased burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil\nand gas in a chemical process that releases carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the most abundant\ngreenhouse gases. Various scientific studies have pointed at the severe economic burden of\nglobal warming for future generations if rising concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse\ngases are not curbed within the next twenty to thirty years, see [6] for a recent account.\n\u2217Department of Statistics, London School of Economics, Houghton St., London WC2A 2AE, UK. e-mail:\nu.cetin@lse.ac.uk.\n\u2020Electrabel Trading and Portfolio Management, 8 Regentlaan, 1000 Brussel, Belgium. e-mail:\nmichel.verschuere@electrabel.com.\n1\nThe Kyoto protocol was opened for signature at the 1997 conference in Kyoto, Japan and\nassigns mandatory emission limits for greenhouse gases to signatory nations. These nations\nmust reduce their emissions for carbon dioxide and five other gases in 2008-2012 by 5% with\nrespect to 1990 levels in order to comply with the protocol. Signatory nations that do not\nmeet these targets will be penalized, but emission rights, called \u2018allowances\u2019, may otherwise\nbe traded bilaterally in a process referred to as \u2018carbon trading\u2019.\nThe European Commission launched the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP)\nin June 2000 with the objective to identify, develop and implement the essential elements of\nan EU strategy to implement the Kyoto Protocol. All 25 EU countries simultaneously ratified\nthe Kyoto Protocol on 31 May 2002. The European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU\nETS) is a significant part of the ECCP and currently constitutes the largest emissions trading\nscheme in the world. It is widely regarded as a trial phase for the eventual Kyoto period\n(2008-2012) during which carbon emission allowances will become a traded commodity on an\neven larger, global scale. To participate in the ETS, EU member states must first submit a\nNational Allocation Plan (NAP) for approval to the European Commission. Selected carbon\nintensive installations such as steel manufacturers, power stations of above 20 MW capacity,\ncement factories, etc. receive free emission allowances under the terms of this NAP, enabling\nthem to emit greenhouse gases up to the assigned tonnage.\nInstallations can bilaterally trade emission allowances under the EU ETS, in order to\noffset any excess or shortage of carbon emission permits compared to the NAP issuance.\nAbout 12.000 installations within the Union are covered by the EU ETS in a first phase (2005-\n2007), representing almost 50% of total carbon emissions. The EU ETS enables selected\nindustries to reduce carbon emissions in a cost effective manner, i.e. carbon emissions come\nat a cost but installations can opt for either reducing actual carbon emissions or buying\nadditional allowances, for instance in case upgrading of the installation would turn out more\nexpensive. The NAP only imposes a cap on the total actual carbon emissions per member\nstate.\nActual trading in EU ETS emission allowances began January 1st, 2005. By the end of\nthe same year, almost 400 million tonnes of carbon equivalent had been traded, representing\na turnover in excess of EUR 7 billion. The impact of the release of sensitive information\nregarding the ETS net position in carbon emission allowances can be dramatic, as was\nillustrated in April 2006. First phase EU ETS carbon, in the form of the allowance expiring\nin December 2007, written Dec-07, had reached EUR 30 per tonne at their high in April\n2006. Prices subsequently plumetted to below EUR 10 per tonne in a few days beginning\nMay 2006 (see Figure 1) after EU figures on actual 2005 emission levels suggested emission\ncaps to selected industries had been too generous to have a significant impact on emission\npractice. Emission caps for the second phase (2008-2012) are currently under review because\nof this apparent generosity of NAP levels in the first phase.\nEvery installation included in the EU ETS has to surrender carbon allowances at the\nend of April of every calendar year in order to cover its emissions during the preceding\nyear. In case the installation is not able to surrender enough allowances a penalty of EUR\n100 (EUR 40 for Phase I) for each tonne of excess emission is to be paid. Payment of\n2\nthe excess emission penalty, however, does not release the installation from the obligation\nto surrender the number of allowances equal to those excess emissions. The company is\nrequired to provide these allowances when surrendering the carbon allowances in relation to\nthe following calendar year. The essential difference between Phase I and II lies in the fact\nthat the banking of allowances is not permitted during Phase I and, thus, the allowances\nexpires at their stated maturity, while the allowances issued during Phase II can be banked\nby the installations for future use. The mechanism described above provides a direct link\nbetween the spot and forward prices of carbon allowances. To see this consider, e.g., the\nso-called Dec-07 and Dec-08 contracts that had been traded in the EU ETS during 2007.\nDec-07 contract expires at the end of December 2007 and can be used to cover emissions\nduring 2007. On the other hand Dec-08 contract has maturity December 2008 and can only\nbe used to cover emissions during the calendar year of 2008. Since these two contracts are\ntraded during Phase I in which banking is not allowed Dec-07 contracts cannot be used to\ncover emissions in 2008. Therefore, the prices of Dec-07 contracts can be viewed as the spot\nprice for carbon allowances during 2007 and the Dec-08 contracts can be viewed as a forward\ncontract. Prices of Dec-07 contracts at the end Dec-07 will be zero if the EU zone is net\nlong EU ETS allowances in 2007. Indeed, since the zone is net long there are some firms\nholding carbon allowances that they do not need. We may assume there are at least two\nsuch firms since the number of installations in the scheme is large enough. The competition\namong these firms will drive the price of the Dec-07 allowances to 0. On the other hand,\nif the zone is net short then Dec-07 contracts will not be worthless and their price will be\nequal to the price of Dec-08 contract plus the penalty due to the aforementioned regulations\non the surrendering of the allowances. the Industries can then opt for borrowing their short\nETS position into the next phase at a fixed cost of EUR 40 per tonne.\nA similar arbitrage relationship between the spot and forward prices of carbon exists in\nPhase II. However, the situation is a little more complicated due to banking. In particular the\nprice of the spot will not be zero even if the zone is net long since the current allowances can\nbe used later to cover emissions. We discuss how the model can be extended to incorporate\nbanking of the permits in Section 7. Banking is also permitted between phase II and phase III\n(2013-2017), but as the mechanism beyond the 2012 Kyoto deadline is still largely unknown,\nwe will not address the consequences of this additional optionality for now.\nIn this paper, we provide a framework to study the spot prices of carbon allowances\ntraded in EU ETS. Using the above no-arbitrage principle between the spot and forward\nprices of carbon allowances we shall derive the pricing formulas for the carbon allowances by\nassuming an exogenous price process for the forward contract. We study the pricing using a\nlocal risk minimising criteria under two settings where the market\u2019s net position is common\nknowledge and is not. This approach also enables us to come up with the optimal hedging\nstrategy for the spot contract. In this incomplete information setting we use techniques\nfrom stochastic filtering theory in order to model the market\u2019s estimate for the net position.\nMoreover, our approach enables us to calculate the probability of net long position.\nThe relationship between the probability of market being long and the prices of EUA\ncontracts has also been observed in [1]. Their observation is based on their intuition and\n3\n0 100 200 300 400\nTrading day since June 7, 2005\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nP\nr\nic\ne\nH\nE\nU\nR\n\u0090\nt\nL\nEUA prices: Dec-07 HGreyL vs. Dec-08 HBlackL\nFigure 1: EUA price history between June 7th, 2005 and May 5th, 2007\nthey do not intend to do a rigorous mathematical analysis. Moreover, to the best of our\nknowledge, an in-depth quantitative analysis of the pricing and hedging issues in EU ETS is\nyet to be done. Paolella and Taschini [8] makes an econometric analysis of EU ETS market.\nSeifert, et al. [11] and Fehr and Hinz [2] study the spot carbon prices in equilibrium. Seifert,\net al. avoid the natural complications of an equilibrium analysis by assuming every market\nparticipant risk-neutral or the existence of a representative agent with a logarithmic utility,\nthereby reducing the problem to the problem of a central planner who aims to maximize the\ntotal profit of all agents. Fehr and Hinz study an equilibrium among N market participants.\nAlthough the setting is more realistic, the model only gives a characterization of spot prices\nbut does not produce explicit solutions. In this paper we avoid the equilibrium approach\nto spot prices but use aforementioned arbitrage relationship to come up with an explicit\nsemimartingale represenation for the carbon spot prices.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the underlying model for\nthe pricing of carbon credits. Section 3 studies the pricing and hedging of carbon credits\nunder the complete information on the market\u2019s net position while Section 4 studies the\nsame problem under, more realistic, incomplete information setting. Section 5 discusses the\neffects of intermediate announcements of the net position over the spot prices. Section 6\npresents a numerical study and Section 7 concludes. In the appendix we provide a glossary\nof terms and abbreviations used in the paper for the convenience of the reader.\n4\n2 Model\nWe start with a filtered probability space, (\u2126,F , (Ft)t\u22650,P), satisfying usual conditions. All\nstochastic processes in what follows will be defined on and adapted to this space. We consider\na market for the trading of the EUAs (carbon allowances traded in the EU ETS scheme) as\ndescribed in the introduction. For simplicity, we assume there are two EUAs traded in the\nmarket: EUA for the current year, denoted with EUA0, and EUA for the next year, denoted\nwith EUA1. An example could be the market for Dec-07 and Dec-08 contracts traded in EU\nETS 2007. We suppose the price process, S, for the EUA1 contract is a continuous process\nsatisfying\ndSt = St\u00b5(t, St, \u03b8t)dt+ St\u03c3(t, St, \u03b8t)dWt, (2.1)\nwith S0 = s. Here, \u03b8 is a Markov chain, which we shall describe shortly, modelling the net\nposition of the market, and W is a Brownian motion independent of \u03b8. Thus, we assume\n(\u03b8, S) is a vector Markov process. In order to have transparent results we simplify the\nmodelling of S by assuming\n\u03c3(t, s, x) = \u03c3 and \u00b5(t, s, x) = \u00b5+ \u03b1\u03b8, (2.2)\nfor some constants \u03c3, \u00b5 and \u03b1, for all t, s, and x.\nAs seen, the drift term depends on the position of the market. The process \u03b8 is supposed\nto be a ca`dla`g Markov chain in continuous time taking values in E := {\u22121, 1}. The modelling\nidea is that \u03b8t = 1 (resp. \u03b8t = \u22121) corresponds to market being long (resp. short) at time\nt. The heuristics behind this choice relate to the fact that interest in the current year EUA\ncontract decreases as the zone proves long allowances, implying that market participants\n\u2019roll\u2019 their position one year forward which, in its turn, affects the price for the allowance\nfor delivery in the next year. Therefore, the corresponding drift term when market is long\nis \u00b5+\u03b1 while the drift equals \u00b5\u2212\u03b1 when the market is short. The assumption that \u03b8 takes\nonly two values is for simplicity and our theory can be extended to the case when E is any\nfinite set, although some extra effort in calculations will be needed. When E has more than\ntwo elements, the states of the Markov chain can be considered as an indicator of how long\nor short the overall position of the market is.\nAs explained in Introduction, in the case of excess emissions, the payment of the penalty\ndoes not remove the obligation to deliver permits, which means undelivered permits still have\nto be handed in the next calendar year. Hence, in the case of permit shortage, one would\nexpect an upwards shift in the demand for the EUA1 contracts. In view of this observation\nwe typically expect \u03b1 to be negative.\nWe suppose the Markov chain \u03b8 stays in state i for an exponential amount of time with\nparameter \u03bb(i). More precisely, if R is a 2\u00d7 2 matrix of transition probabilities with entries\nRt(i, j) := P(\u03b8t = j|\u03b80 = i) and Q is the generator matrix defined by\nQ =\n( \u2212\u03bb(1) \u03bb(1)\n\u03bb(2) \u2212\u03bb(2)\n)\n,\n5\nthen the transition probabilities solves the forward equation\nR\u2032t = RtQ, R0 = I, (2.3)\nwhere I is the identity matrix and R\u2032t(i, j) =\nd\ndt\nRt(i, j). We denote the initial distribution\nfor \u03b8 with p. The following result is well-known (see e.g. [4])\nLemma 2.1 Let \u03b8 be the right-continuous Markov chain taking values in E with the initial\ndistribution p and the generator matrix Q. Then,\n\u03b8t = \u03b80 \u2212 2\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03b8s\u03bb(\u03b8s)ds+Nt, (2.4)\nfor each t, where N is a martingale. Moreover, the decomposition \u03b8 = \u03b80 +N + A where N\nis a martingale and A is a predictable process with N0 = A0 = 0 is unique.\nThe following assumption is to simplify the computations and the exposition. We stress here\nthat our approach still works without the next assumption.\nAssumption 2.1 \u03bb(1) = \u03bb(2) = \u03bb.\nNow we turn to the pricing of EUA0 contracts. Under the assumption of no banking of\npermits these contracts will be worthless if market ends up long at their respective expiry\ndate, which we denote with T . If the market is instead short at time T, then these contracts\ncan be turned into an EUA1 contract by paying a penalty K. Letting P denote the price\nprocess of EUA0 contracts, this implies we have the following relation between S and P at\ntime T\nPT =\n{\nST +K, if \u03b8T \u2264 0;\n0, otherwise,\n(2.5)\nso that EUA0 can be considered as an option on EUA1. In the next two sections we will\ndiscuss the local risk minimisation approach to the pricing and hedging in EU ETS market.\n3 Pricing and hedging under complete information\nThe model introduced above for the prices of carbon allowances is typically incomplete. This\nis because the price process S depends on two sources of uncertainity, W and \u03b8, while \u03b8 is\nnot tradable. As we are in an incomplete setting, there is usually an interval of arbitrage-\nfree prices, and depending on the chosen approach one could come up with different prices\nand hedging strategies for the same derivative. In this paper we will use the so-called local-\nrisk minimisation approach and for background reading we refer to Schweizer [10], Fo\u00a8lmer\nand Schweizer [3], and Monat and Stricker [7]. We suppose the traders have access to full\ninformation about the market so that they have the filtration F := (Ft)0\u2264t\u2264T . Following [3]\nwe define the optimal hedging strategy for a given contingent claim as follows.\n6\nDefinition 3.1 Let C \u2208 L2(\u2126,FT ,P) be a contingent claim. A predictable trading strategy\n\u03beC is said to be optimal if there exists a square integrable F-martingale, LC, orthogonal to\nW such that\nC = c+\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03betdSt + L\nC\nT . (3.6)\nA second look at the decomposition in (3.6) reveals that\n\u222b T\n0\n\u03betdSt corresponds to the part of\nthe risk that is hedgable. LCT on the other hand corresponds to the intrinsic risk associated\nwith the contingent claim that is not hedgable. Existence of (3.6) is intimately linked to the\nso-called minimal martingale measure.\nDefinition 3.2 Let X be a continuous semimartingale with the canonical decomposition\nX = X0 +M +A with M a martingale and A is adapted, continuous and of finite variation.\nA probability measure P\u0302 \u223c P is called minimal martingale measure if X follows a martingale\nunder P\u0302, P\u0302 = P on F0 and any square integrable martingale orthogonal to M remains a\nmartingale under P\u0302.\nThe minimal martingale measure is uniquely determined (see, e.g., [3]) and in our case is\ndefined by\ndP\u0302\ndP\n= exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b T\n0\n\u00b5+ \u03b1\u03b8s\n\u03c3\ndWs \u2212 1\n2\n\u222b T\n0\n(\n\u00b5+ \u03b1\u03b8s\n\u03c3\n)2\nds\n)\n.

Then there exists a unique \u03beC such that\nVt = E\u0302[C] +\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03beCs dSs + L\nC\nt ,\nwhere LC is an F-martingale orthogonal to W and Vt := E\u0302[C|Ft].\nIn view of the above theorem we conclude that \u03beC defined by the Radon-Nikodym derivative\n\u03beCt :=\nd\u3008V, S\u3009\nd\u3008S\u3009\nis the optimal strategy in the sense of Definition 3.1. The following definition gives the price\nof a contingent claim under complete information.\n7\nDefinition 3.3 Let C \u2208 L2(\u2126,FT ,P) be a contingent claim and let P\u0302 be the unique minimal\nmartingale measure for S given by (3.7). The fair price PCt at time t for C is given by\nPCt := E\u0302[C|Ft].\nFor the problem under consideration C = (ST+K)1{\u03b8T=\u22121} =\nST+K\n2\n(1\u2212\u03b8T ). In the remaining\nof this section we calculate the price and hedging strategy for EUA0 contracts. In view of\nLemma 2.1, \u03b8 = \u03b80+N+A where N is a martingale and A is a predictable process defined by\nAt = \u22122\u03bb\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03b8sds. Since \u03b8 and W are independent, it follows that N and W are orthogonal\nmartingales under P; thus, N remains a martingale under P\u0302 and is orthogonal to S. Since S\nis square integrable under P\u0302,\nE\u0302\n[\u222b T\n0\nA2sd\u3008S\u3009s\n]\n<\u221e,\nso that\n\u222b \u00b7\n0\nAsdSs\u2227T is a square integrable martingale. Therefore, letting E\u0302t[\u00b7] denote E\u0302[\u00b7|Ft],\nPt = E\u0302t\n[\nST +K\n2\n(1\u2212 \u03b80 \u2212NT )\u2212 ST +K\n2\nAT\n]\n=\nSt +K\n2\n(1\u2212 \u03b80 \u2212Nt)\u2212 E\u0302t\n[\nST +K\n2\nAT\n]\n. (3.8)\nThe only term that needs to be calculated is the expectation in (3.8). For this we will use\nthe explicit form for A.\nProposition 3.1 Let\nMt := \u03b8t exp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 t)), t \u2208 [0, T ].\nThen M is a P\u0302-martingale and\nE\u0302t\n[\nST +K\n2\nAT\n]\n= \u03b8t\nSt +K\n2\nexp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 t))\u2212 (\u03b80 +Nt)St +K\n2\n.\nProof. Let\nYt = \u03b8t\nSt +K\n2\nexp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 t))\u2212 (\u03b80 +Nt)St +K\n2\n.\nSince YT =\nST+K\n2\nAT it suffices to show Y is P\u0302-martingale. Since N is a P\u0302-martingale\northogonal to S it follows that (\u03b80 +N)(S +K)\/2 is a P\u0302-martingale. Moreover,\n\u03b8t exp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 t)) = \u03b80 exp(\u22122\u03bbT ) +\n\u222b t\n0\nexp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 s)d\u03b8s +\n\u222b t\n0\n2\u03bb\u03b8s exp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 s))ds\n= \u03b80 exp(\u22122\u03bbT ) +\n\u222b t\n0\nexp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 s)dNs\nsince dAt = \u22122\u03bb\u03b8tdt. This implies (Mt)0\u2264t\u2264T is a martingale orthogonal to S so that\n(\u03b8t\nSt+K\n2\nexp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 t)))0\u2264t\u2264T is a martingale, too. \u0004\nSumming up the above calculations we have the following result:\n8\nTheorem 3.2 The fair price for EUA0 contracts is given by\nPt = (St +K)\n1\u2212 \u03b8t exp(\u22122\u03bb(T \u2212 t))\n2\n.\nThe optimal hedging strategy, \u03be0 associated with EUA0 contracts is given by\n\u03be0t :=\n1\u2212Mt\n2\n,\nfor each t \u2208 [0, T ].\nProof. Expression for the price follows from (3.8) and Proposition 3.1. To find the\nhedging strategy it suffices to find the integral representation for P , which equals\nPt = (S0 +K)(1\u2212 \u03b80 exp(\u22122\u03bbT )\/2) +\n\u222b t\n0\n1\u2212Ms\n2\ndSs \u2212\n\u222b t\n0\n(Ss +K)dMs,\nfor each t \u2208 [0, T ]. \u0004\nIn other words, part of the risk at time t, corresponding the term\n\u222b t\n0\n1\u2212Ms\n2\ndSs, associated\nto the claim CT can be hedged if one follows the locally-risk minimising strategy which consist\nof holding (1\u2212M)\/2 shares of the traded underlying, whose price process is given by S.\n4 Pricing under incomplete information\nThe EU ETS market participants typically do not observe \u03b8 continuosly. In this section we\nstudy the pricing of EUA0 contracts under incomplete information. We suppose the only\ninformation available to the market is the usual right-continous and complete augmentation\nof S, denoted with FS and the one-time announcement of the true value of \u03b8 at time T . If\nG denotes the filtration modelling the information structure of the market, then\nGt =\n{ FSt , for t < T ;\nFST \u2228 \u03c3(\u03b8T ), for t = T.\nLet \u03b8 denote the optional projection of \u03b8 to FS which gives \u03b8t = E[\u03b8t|FSt ], for each t \u2265 0. We\nnow apply the aforementioned local-risk minimisation approach to the pricing and hedging\nof EUA0 under incomplete information, i.e. when the available information is modelled by\nG.\nTheorem 4.1 Define W by\nW t =\n\u222b t\n0\ndSs \u2212 (\u00b5+ \u03b1\u03b8s)Ssds\n\u03c3Ss\n,\nand Z by Zt = 1[t=T ](\u03b8T \u2212\u03b8T ) for each t \u2265 0. Then, W and Z are orthogonal G-martingales.\nMoreover, W is a G-Brownian motion.\n9\nProof. It follows from standard filtering theory, see, e.g., [5], that W is an FS-Brownian\nmotion. Observe that W stays a martingale when FS is enlarged with \u03c3(\u03b8T ) at time T . This\nis simply because E[W T |Gt] = E[W T |FSt ] = W t, for each t < T . This shows that W is a\nG-Brownian motion as well by Le\u00b4vy\u2019s characterisation of Brownian motion. To show Z is a\nG-martingale observe that, for t < T , E[ZT |Gt] = E[ZT |FSt ] = E[E[ZT |FST ]|Ft] = 0 = Zt. Z\nand W are orthogonal since [W,Z] = 0. \u0004\nUsing standard filtering theory (see Theorem 8.1 in [5]) and the fact that \u03b82 = 1, we have\nd\u03b8t = \u22122\u03bb\u03b8tdt+ \u03b1\n\u03c3\n(1\u2212 \u03b8t2)dW t, (4.9)\nwith \u03b80 = 2p\u2212 1. Note that under the smaller filtration, G, P\u0302 will no longer be the minimal\nmartingale measure for S. However, there is still a unique minimal martingale measure,\ndenoted with P\u2217, associated with S with respect to G.\nDefinition 4.1 The fair price of the EUA0 contracts at time t under incomplete information\nis defined to be\nP t := E\u2217[(ST +K)(1\u2212 \u03b8T )\/2|Gt],\nwhere E\u2217 is the expectation operator under P\u2217.\nNote that\nPt = E\u2217[(ST +K)(1\u2212 \u03b8T )\/2|Gt] = E\u2217[(ST +K)(1\u2212 \u03b8T )\/2|Gt]\u2212 E\u2217[(ST +K)ZT\/2|Gt]\n= E\u2217[(ST +K)(1\u2212 \u03b8T )\/2|Gt]\u2212 (St +K)Zt\n2\n. (4.10)\nTheorem 4.2 Under P\u2217, (S, \u03b8) is a vector Markov process. Moreover,\ndSt = \u03c3StdW\n\u2217\nt , S0 = s; (4.11)\nd\u03b8t = \u2212\n(\n2\u03bb\u03b8t +\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n(1\u2212 \u03b8t2)(\u00b5+ \u03b1\u03b8t)\n)\ndt+\n\u03b1\n\u03c3\n(1\u2212 \u03b8t2)dW \u2217t , \u03b80 = 2p\u2212 1, (4.12)\nwhere W \u2217 is a (G,P\u2217)-Brownian motion and p = P[\u03b80 = 1].\nProof. It suffices to show (S, \u03b8) satisfies (4.11) and (4.12), which will in turn imply (S, \u03b8)\nis Markov. That S satisfies (4.11) follows from the definition of P\u2217. Then,\nd\u03b8t = \u22122\u03bb\u03b8tdt+ \u03b1\n\u03c3\n(1\u2212 \u03b8t2)dW t\n= \u2212\n(\n2\u03bb\u03b8t +\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n(1\u2212 \u03b8t2)(\u00b5+ \u03b1\u03b8t)\n)\ndt+\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n1\u2212 \u03b8t2\nSt\ndSt.\n\u0004\n10\nTheorem 4.3 Let h : R+\u00d7R+\u00d7 [\u22121, 1] 7\u2192 R be the solution to the boundary value problem\nht(t, x, y) + Lh(t, x, y) = 0,\nh(T, x, y) =\nx+K\n2\n(1\u2212 y),\nwhere\nLh(t, x, y) := 1\n2\n\u03c32x2hxx(t, x, y) +\n1\n2\n\u03b12\n\u03c32\n(1\u2212 y2)2hyy(t, x, y) + \u03b1x(1\u2212 y2)hxy(t, x, y)\n\u2212hy(t, x, y)\n(\n2\u03bby +\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n(1\u2212 y2)(\u00b5+ \u03b1y)\n)\n.\nThen\nP t = h(t, St, \u03b8t)\u2212 ZtSt +K\n2\n.\nMoreover, the optimal strategy under incomplete information associated to EUA0 contracts\nis given by the process \u03be = (\u03bet)0\u2264t\u2264T where\n\u03bet := hx(t, St, \u03b8t) +\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n1\u2212 \u03b82t\nSt\nhy(t, St, \u03b8t),\nfor each t \u2208 [0, T ].\nProof. Note that h(T, ST , \u03b8T ) =\nST+K\n2\n(1\u2212\u03b8T ). Thus, it remains to show\n(\nh(t, St, \u03b8t)\n)\n0\u2264t\u2264T\nis a G-martingale. Using Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula\nh(t, St, \u03b8t) = h(0, S0, \u03b80) +\n\u222b t\n0\n{\nhx(s, Ss, \u03b8s) +\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n1\u2212 \u03b82s\nSs\nhy(s, Ss, \u03b8s)\n}\ndSs\n+\n\u222b t\n0\nht(s, Ss, \u03b8s) + Lh(s, Ss, \u03b8s)ds\n= h(0, S0, \u03b80) +\n\u222b t\n0\n{\nhx(s, Ss, \u03b8s) +\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n1\u2212 \u03b82s\nSs\nhy(s, Ss, \u03b8s)\n}\ndSs.\nMoreover, the integrand in the last integral is the optimal strategy. \u0004\nThe above methodology also enables us to price and hedge contingent claims on \u03b8 such as\ndigital options. Suppose there exists a digital option which pays EUR 1 if the market is short\nat time T . If D is the fair price process of this digital option then Dt = E\u2217[(1 \u2212 \u03b8T )\/2|Gt]\ndue to earlier arguments. Thus, Dt = E\u2217[(1\u2212 \u03b8T )\/2|Gt]\u2212Zt\/2. Proceeding along the similar\nlines for the pricing of EUA0 contracts we have the following result.\nTheorem 4.4 Consider a digital option which pays EUR 1 if the market is short at time\nT . The fair price process, D, of this option is given by\nDt = h(t, \u03b8t)\u2212 Zt\n2\n,\n11\nwhere h is the solution to\nht(t, y) + Lh(t, y) = 0,\nh(T, y) =\n1\u2212 y\n2\n,\nand\nLh(t, y) := 1\n2\n\u03b12\n\u03c32\n(1\u2212 y2)2hyy(t, x, y)\u2212 hy(t, x, y)\n(\n2\u03bby +\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n(1\u2212 y2)(\u00b5+ \u03b1y)\n)\n.\nMoreover, the optimal strategy under incomplete information associated to the digital option\nis given by \u03beD = (\u03beDt )0\u2264t\u2264T where\n\u03beDt :=\n\u03b1\n\u03c32\n1\u2212 \u03b82t\nSt\nhy(t, \u03b8t),\nfor each t \u2208 [0, T ].\nAs we mentioned in introduction, we can calculate the probabilities associated to the\nmarket\u2019s position. Let pii(t) := P[\u03b8t = i|Gt] for each i \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Clearly, \u03b8t = pi1(t)\u2212pi\u22121(t) =\n2pi1(t)\u2212 1. Since\nd\u03b8t = \u22122\u03bb\u03b8tdt+ \u03b1\n\u03c3\n(1\u2212 \u03b8t2)dW t,\na little algebra now yields\npi1(t) = p+\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03bb (1\u2212 2pi1(s)) ds+\n\u222b t\n0\npi1(s)\n2\u03b1(1\u2212 pi1(s))\n\u03c3\ndW s. (4.13)\n5 The effect of intermediate announcements\nIn reality, there are instants at which intermediate announcements regarding the zone\u2019s net\nposition are made. Every year, the European union aggregates submitted emission data and\ncompares this to the quantity of allowances surrendered. The processing of emissions data\nfor the entire zone usually takes a couple of months time, and announcements on the zone\u2019s\nnet position are not released until mid April every year. Until that time, spot trading in the\ncontract for delivery in the past year still takes place. As the EU so announces net results\nevery year, we must look a bit deeper into the effects of intermediate announcements on\nnet positions. Intuitively, one expects intermediate announcements to affect prices on more\nthan one occasion, where the impact can be as dramatic as what happened with Dec-07\nprices early May 2006. This event was also induced by intermediate announcements, then\nregarding the net position for the emission year 2005. The long position then implied zero\nvalue for Dec-05 allowances, but prices for Dec-07 were also affected, the difference being\nthat its price remained positive, as risk regarding the net positions for 2007 persisted. In\n12\nthe remainder of this section, we will study the impact of such intermediate announceents\nin the framework of our model.\nTo be more concrete, suppose at some t0 < T the true position of the zone is revealed\nto the market. To ease the calculations we further assume that there will be no further\nannouncements before time T . As it will be seen from the following calculations, this as-\nsumption does not effectively restrict the model since the formulas can be readily extended\nto the case with multiple announcements. Note that we still keep the incomplete information\nsetting described in Section 4. Let, for r \u2264 t,\n\u03c9ij(t, r) := P(\u03b8t = i|FSt , \u03b8r = j), for i, j in E.\nThen, it follows from Theorem 9.4 in [5] and that \u03c9ij(t, r) + \u03c9\u2212ij(t, r) = 1 that\n\u03c9ij(t, r) = \u03b4(i, j) +\n\u222b t\nr\n\u03bb(1\u2212 2\u03c9ij(s, r))ds+\n\u222b t\ns\n\u03c9ij(s, r)\n\u03b1(i\u2212 k)(1\u2212 \u03c9ij(s, r))\n\u03c3\ndW s,\nwhere {k} = E\\{i}.\nNow, we redefine \u03b8 so that \u03b8t = E[\u03b8t|FSt , \u03b8t0 ] for t > t0. Since \u03b8 takes values in E, we\nhave that \u03b8t = 2\u03c91\u03b8t0 (t, t0)\u2212 1, for t > t0. This implies that the dynamics of \u03b8 changes to\n\u03b8t = \u03b8t0 \u2212 2\n\u222b t\nt0\n\u03bb\u03b8sds+\n\u03b1\n\u03c3\n(1\u2212 \u03b8s2)dW s, (5.14)\nfor t \u2265 t0. Note that for t < t0 the expression for \u03b8 is still given by (4.9). This implies that,\ntypically, there will be a jump in \u03b8 at time t0 since \u03b8t0\u2212 will be different than \u03b8t0 as long as\n0 < P(\u03b8t = 1) < 1 for all t.\nAn attractive feature of the expression (5.14) is that it is the unique solution to the SDE\ndefined by (4.9) but with the initial condition \u03b8t0 = \u03b8t0 . This is of course no surprise given\nthe Markovian structure of our model. An immediate consequence of this is that for t \u2265 t0\nPt = h(t, St, \u03b8t)\u2212 ZtSt +K\n2\n,\nwhere h is the function that is defined in Theorem 4.3, and Zt = 1[t=T ](\u03b8T \u2212 \u03b8T ) as before.\nNow, let \u03b8\u02dct := E[\u03b8t|FSt ], for t \u2264 t0. Then, for t < t0\nPt = E\u2217[h(t0, St0 , \u03b8t0)|Gt]\n= E\u2217[h(t0, St0 , \u03b8t0)\u2212 h(t0, St0 , \u03b8\u02dct0)|Gt] + E\u2217[h(t0, St0 , \u03b8\u02dct0)|Gt]\n= Zht + h(t, St, \u03b8\u02dct),\nwhere\nZht = E\u2217[h(t0, St0 , \u03b8t0)\u2212 h(t0, St0 , \u03b8\u02dct0)|Gt], (5.15)\nfor t \u2264 t01 Summing up the above calculations we have the following theorem.\n1Note that E\u2217 is the expectation operator under the minimal martingale measure in this new setting,\nwhich will typically be different than the minimal martingale measure P\u2217 from the previous section.\n13\nTheorem 5.1 Suppose that the true state of \u03b8 is revealed at time t0 < T . The fair price of\nEUA0 contracts is given by\nPt =\n{\nh(t, St, \u03b8t)\u2212 Zt St+K2 , for t \u2265 t0,\nZht + h(t, St, \u03b8\u02dct), for t < t0,\nwhere h is the function defined in Theorem 4.3 and Zh is as defined in (5.15). P has a jump\nat t0 and the jump size equals\n\u2206Pt0 = h(t0, St0 , \u03b8t0)\u2212 h(t0, St0 , \u03b8\u02dct0)\u2212 Zht0 .\nProof. The equation for P follows from the definition of the fair price of EUA0 contracts.\nIn order to see the second assertion, first note that Gt = FSt for t < T . Since all FS-\nmartingales are continuous, it follows that (Zht )0\u2264t\u2264t0 is a continuous FS-martingale. Thus,\nPt0\u2212 = h(t0, St0 , \u03b8\u02dct0) + Z\nh\nt0\n,\nsince h and \u03b80 are continuous. \u0004\nNotice that E\u2217[\u2206Pt0|Gt] = 0 for all t \u2264 t0. However, \u2206Pt0 is typically nonzero unless \u03b8t0\nis deterministic.\n6 Numerical study\nIn this section, we will will investigate the stylized facts of our model as apparent from a\nsimulation run. We will pick a random path of EUA1 price process based on the dynamics\nin (2.1), after which we can calculate the fair price process for the EUA0 contract given the\nevolution of EUA1 prices by numerically solving the boundary value problem in Theorem\n(4.3). The fact that the EUA0 price is essentially expressed in terms of the conditional\nexpectation in Definition (4.1) provides us with a means to avoid the resolution of the\ncomplex PDE. It implies that calculation of the carbon spot price can also be calculated\nin a Monte Carlo routine, which is technically simpler and less prone to issues of numerical\ninstability of grid solutions.\nFor this purpose we first need to simulate a path for the process \u03b8 modelling the net\nposition of the market. The parameters used in order to produce the following graphs are\ngiven in the table below.\nParameter Value\n\u03b1 \u22120.5\n\u03c3 1\n\u03bb 2\nK 40\n\u00b5 0.4\nS0 20.00\n\u03b80 \u22121\np 0.5\nT 240\n14\nWe set T = 240 and divide this period into 240 trading dates of equal length. Figure 2\nshows the simulated path for the position \u03b8 (gray) of the zone. We next proceed to simulate a\npath for EUA1 prices from equation (2.1). Note that we have compensated the value chosen\nfor \u03b1 = \u22120.5 by taking \u00b5 = 0.4. This is important, as the drift can otherwise become very\nlarge, resulting in EUA1 prices running out of range. The resulting simulation for EUA1\nprices is plotted as the green curve in Figure 3. The next task is to estimate \u03b8\u00af out of the\nfiltering equations in (4.11) and (4.12). To commence this, we start from the starter value\n\u03b8\u00af(0) = 2p\u22121, here equal to zero. At every time t, we compute \u03b8\u00af as a conditional expectation\nacross 1000 Monte Carlo steps, simulating paths post time-t and averaging over the payoff\nfor EUA0 prices at maturity.\nWe opted for a scenario where the true state of the market is revealed after 192 time steps,\nor 4\/5 of the interval. This event is marked by the plots for \u03b8 and \u03b8\u00af in Figure 2 coinciding as\n\u03b8\u00af \u2018jumps\u2019 onto \u03b8 = +1, highlighting an apparent long position for the market as soon as the\nintermediate announcement is released. Figure 2 shows the path for \u03b8 (green) versus that\nfor \u03b8\u00af (black) for the parameter choices at hand. After the \u2018jump\u2019 in the \u03b8\u00af path, the market\nperception of the true state reverts back towards zero. This is due to the observed increase\nin EUA1 prices. Note that due to the negative relationship with the sign of the net position\nand the drift of the EUA1 prices, the observed upward drift in EUA1 prices will lead the\nmarket to think that the net position might be changing from long to short. On the other\nhand , the terminal value for \u03b8 equals +1 after 240 time steps, implying that the market\neventually ended up long in this simulation. As a result, we observe prices for EUA0 (black)\ncollapse to zero at the end of the trading period, as shown in Figure 3.\nThe effect of the intermediate announcement of an apparent long position after 192 steps\nis that EUA0 prices strongly decrease compared to the EUA1 driving force behind them\nat that point in time. The paths for both EUA0 and EUA1 prices are shown in Figure 3.\nThe intermediate announcement of a long position after 192 time steps is marked by a sharp\ndecline in EUA0 prices, compared to the prevailing price levels for EUA0. Beyond this point,\nEUA1 prices rally, and the EUA0 contract partly mimics this behaviour due to the change\nin the market\u2019s perception of the unobserved net position as explained in the last paragraph.\nHowever, at maturity, the zone ends up long, implying EUA0 prices dropping to zero after\n240 steps.\nThe relationship between EUA0 and EUA1 prices from the simulation performed is re-\nmarkably similar to the historical evolution of the Dec-07 and Dec-08 prices in Figure 1,\nwhere an intermediate announcement in April 2006 (after about 220 time steps) regarding\nthe (long) ETS position led to a dramatic collapse in carbon prices. The resemblance could\nbe improved by extending the set of admissible states for \u03b8 from just two elements. Recall\nthat the slow but steady decline of DEC07 prices to level 0 was largely due to the fact that\nthe information release in April 2006 revealed that NAP levels were so generous that there\nis almost no possibility for the zone to end up short at the end of the year. Obviously, it is\nnot possible to measure how long or short the zone is by a \u03b8 process with only two states.\nTherefore, a better fit to the data could be more easily achived by introducing more states\nto the model. However, we still want to limit ourselves to a model with two states which\n15\nFigure 2: True \u03b8 (gray) and corresponding \u03b8\u00af path (black) for a long market scenario\nis good enough to highlight the ability of our model to capture the main features of carbon\nprices, and in order to stay consistent with the simple exposition of the theory outlined in\nthe previous sections. Moreover, it is also worth to mention that as the carbon market is\nstill not mature the price behaviour is not always caused by rational actions in an efficient\nfinancial market, thereby making the capture of certain price movements impossible by a\nconsistent and rigorous model.\n7 Concluding remarks and extensions\nWe discussed the pricing and hedging of EUA contracts traded within the EU ETS scheme\nwhen banking of permits are not allowed. The key idea of our model is to make the drift\ncomponent of EUA1s dependent on the net position of the market at large. This combined\nwith the no-arbitrage relation between EUA0 gave us the setting where we can infer the\nlong probabilities from EUA1 prices and calculate arbitrage free prices for EUA0 contracts.\nSince the setting is incomplete by nature there exists an interval for arbitrage-free prices\nand we have chosen one price based on a local risk minimising criteria. As seen in Section\n3 one can come up with explicit formulas for pricing and hedging under the assumption\nthat the market\u2019s net position is common knowledge among the market participants. Under\nthe more realistic setting where the market does not observe the net position directly the\nprice of EUA0 contracts and associated hedging portfolios can be obtained by solving a\nboundary value problem. The analytical solution for the PDE cannot be obtained, however,\na numerical solution for the price via Monte Carlo simulation can be computed easily and\nfast.\n16\nFigure 3: Simulated EUA price history for a long market scenario\nAccording to the latest EU Directive [9] banking of carbon permits is allowed during\nand after the second phase of Kyoto protocol. Our approach can be modified to incorporate\nthis optionality of the current carbon trading as well. In order to price correctly the EUA0\ncontracts, we need to first determine what the appropriate condition relating the spot and\nforward contracts at time T should be. When the banking is in effect, the unused permits\nwill no longer be worthless after the year in which they were issued since they can be used\nlater to cover the the excess emissions. This implies that although the identity ST +K = PT\nholds when \u03b8T = \u22121, PT > 0 when \u03b8T = +1. This will make the pricing of EUA0 contracts\ncomplicated since now the pricing of such contracts will depend on the utility functions of\nthe agents holding EUA0 contracts and the probability of them needing these permits at\na future date. Indeed they will have to determine a price at which they will be indifferent\nbetween selling it now to other agents who will need these contracts to cover their positions\nor keeping these permits for possible future use, either by themselves or others. In order to\nsimplify the matters one may assume that there exists a representative agent representing\nthe overall traders and this agent is risk neutral, i.e. has an objective to maximise expected\nprofit. Let\u2019s also suppose that there are only 2 periods to trade, one being [0, T ] and other\n[T, 2T ]. This is only to ease exposition and the extension to a multiperiod setting will be\nstraightforward. Thus, the indifference price of EUA0 contracts for the representative agent\nis given by\nPT =\n{\nST +K, if \u03b8T = \u22121,\nE[1[\u03b82T=\u22121]S2T |ST , \u03b8T = 1] if \u03b8T = 1.\nIn order to find E[1[\u03b82T=\u22121]S2T |ST , \u03b8T ] we need to find the joint distribution of (\u03b82T , S2T )\ngiven (\u03b8T , ST ). However, this joint distribution can be easily found using the well-known\nKolmogorov\u2019s equations given the Markov property of (\u03b8, S). Once E[1[\u03b82T=\u22121]S2T |ST , \u03b8T ]\n17\nthe method explained in earlier sections can now be utilised to calculate price process of\nEUA0 contracts.\nAnother possible improvement for the model would be to allow nonsymmetric changes\nin drift, in the sense that news regarding short positions reduce the drift more strongly than\ncontinued conviction on the overdimensioning of NAP volumes. Note that when \u03b8 takes only\ntwo values the linearity assumption is without loss of generality once we assume that the\ndrift is only a function of \u03b8. Thus, in order to include such non-symmetric changes in drift\none should model \u03b8 by a Markov chain with more than two states. This would as well give\nchances for a better calibration of the model using the market data.\nReferences\n[1] Ellerman, D. and Parsons, J. (2006): Shortage, inter-period pricing and bank-\ning.

Preprint.\nA Glossary\nEU ETS The European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the largest multi-\nnational emissions trading scheme in the world. The ETS covers over 12.000 instal-\nlations in energy and industrial sectors, representing nearly half of the EU carbon\ndioxide (CO2) emissions. Operators of installations covered by the ETS within the EU\nmust monitor and annually report on their CO2 emissions and are obliged to return\nan amount of emission allowances sufficient to cover their annual emissions.\nFirst & second phase In the beginning of each phase allowances are issued for multi-year\nperiods at once. The first ETS phase extended from 2005 until 2007 and the second\nphase from 2008 until 2012.\nNAP Within each of the phases, operators obtain a number of free allowances under the\nterms of the National Allocation Plan (NAP). The extent in which these free allowances\ncover the actual needs of the operator varies across the participant industrial sectors.\nAny remaining allowances needed must be covered in the open market where EU CO2\nallowances (EUA\u2019s) are traded.\nEUA The European Union Allowance (EUA) for CO2 is the main vehicle enabling operators\nstill short allowances after NAP issuance to cover their actual carbon dioxide emissions.\nContracts entailing the delivery of EUA at various future instants are traded under\nthe ETS. The maturity for a standardized contract is December. For instance, the\ncontract called \u2019Dec-08\u2019 delivers the allowance for one tonne of CO2 into the buyers\u2019\nETS account in December 2008. Trading and price formation of these allowances\nhappens Over The Counter (OTC) or via an exchange such as the European Climate\nExchange (ECX).\nEUA0 & EUA1 In our paper, EUA0 represents the price of the EUA contract for the\nallowance delivering in the current year. The contract delivering an allowance in the\nsubsequent year is denoted by EUA1. Examples treated in this paper are the case\nwhere EUA0 refers to the Dec-07 contract delivering in the first phase, while EUA1\ndepicts the Dec-08 contract delivering in the second phase (no banking from one year\nto another is permitted in this case).\n19\n"}
