The emis-\nsion of culturable microorganisms, and their constituent\nparts, into the air from composting has been well docu-\nmented [2-4], with agitation activities such as shredding,\nturning and screening shown to enhance the release of\nfrom Joint Environment and Human Health Programme: Annual Science Day Conference and Workshop\nBirmingham, UK. 24-25 February 2009\nPublished: 21 December 2009\nEnvironmental Health 2009, 8(Suppl 1):S9 doi:10.1186\/1476-069X-8-S1-S9\n<supplement> <title> <p>Proceedings of the Joint Environment and Human Health Programme: Annual Science Day Conference and Workshop<\/p> <\/title> <editor>Michael N Moore and Pamela D Kempton<\/editor> <sponsor> <note>Publication of this supplement was made possible with support from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), Environment Agency (EA), Department of the Environment &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra), Ministry of Defence (MOD), Medical Research Council (MRC), The Wellcome Trust, Economic &amp; Social Research Council (ESRC), Biotechnology and Biological Scienc s Research Council (BBSRC), Engine ring and Physical Scie ces Research Council (EPSRC) a d Health Protection Agency (HPA).<\/note> sponsor> <note>Proceedings<\/n te> <url>http:\/\/www.biomedc ntral.com\/c ntent\/pdf\/1476-069X-8-s1-info.pdf<\/url> <\/supplement>\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/8\/S1\/S9\n\u00a9 2009 Deacon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 4\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nEnvironmental Health 2009, 8(Suppl 1):S9 http:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/8\/S1\/S9bioaerosols. The potential for public health to be\nadversely affected by bioaerosol emissions from compost-\ning has been identified [3,5]. In view of this, regulators in\nthe UK require risk assessments to be completed for any\nlicensed composting facility that has a sensitive receptor\nwithin 250 m of the facility boundary [6]. Whilst some\nprogress has been made in the quantification of emissions\nand downwind dispersal of culturable microorganisms\nfrom composting facilities [7] relatively little is known\nabout the concentrations in outdoor air of cell constitu-\nents such as endotoxin generated by composting.\nEndotoxin is the biologically active lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS) that is a major constituent of the outer membrane\nof Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Endotoxin is a potent\nproinflammatory agent that produces airway inflamma-\ntion when inhaled. Elevated levels of endotoxin have been\nmeasured in various environments including cotton mills,\ngrain storage and processing buildings, farm animal\nbarns, sewage treatment plants and humidified work areas\n[8-12]. Inhalation of endotoxin at elevated concentrations\nhave been associated with acute airway obstruction,\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic bronchitis and\ndecreased lung function [13]. There have been several\nstudies of occupational exposures and the health of work-\ners in composting facilities. These have shown significant\nincreases in airway and skin diseases than in controls. A\nstudy of Dutch compost workers [5] reported excess acute\nand sub-chronic non-immune inflammation in the upper\nairways which they suggested was induced by exposure to\nendotoxin and glucans. However, there have been very\nfew studies of health in the general public around com-\nposting sites. Studies based on self-reporting criteria either\nfound no association between respiratory symptoms and\nliving near a composting site, or a significantly increased\nrisk for a number of health complaints based on distance\nbetween home and the composting site [14].\nThis paper describes an exploratory study of endotoxin\nemissions and dispersal from a commercial composting\nfacility. Replicated samples of air were taken by filtration\nat different locations around the facility on 10 occasions\nduring 2007 and 2008. Measurements were made of\nendotoxin and associated culturable microorganisms. The\ninflammatory response of cell cultures exposed to extracts\nfrom the filters containing endotoxin was used as a pre-\nliminary step towards assessing the health significance of\nendotoxin release to the environment.\nMethods\nSampling took place at a large-scale green waste compost-\ning facility in central England. The site receives 25,000\ntonnes green waste per annum, sourced from kerbside col-\nlection and civic amenity sites. Shredding and screening is\ncarried out using dedicated machinery, whilst windrow\nturning is carried out using a front-loader. The sampling\nprocedures have been described previously [15]. Briefly,\nsamples were taken using SKC sampling pumps operated\nat a flow rate of 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 L min-1 and attached to SKC IOM\nparticulate sampling heads, loaded with IOM multi-dust\nplastic cassettes and positioned at a height of 1.7 m. Each\nsample cassette contained a sterile 0.8 \u03bcm pore size poly-\ncarbonate filter. Six pumps were run simultaneously at\neach location for 30 min to capture microbial cells (n = 3)\nand endotoxin (n = 3). Samples were taken upwind of the\nfacility, within the operational area, at the site boundary\nand at locations downwind of the boundary (50, 80, 100,\n150, 180 and 280 m). Samples were taken at times of site\nactivity (shredding, screening and turning of waste) or no\nactivity (e.g. lunchtime). The site was sampled 10 times\nfrom Autumn 2007 to Summer 2008 at approximately\nmonthly intervals. Methods for microbiological enumera-\ntion have been described previously [7,15]. Briefly, fil-\ntered cells were suspended in buffer solution, diluted and\nplated onto selective media for Aspergillus fumigatus, actin-\nomycetes and Gram-negative bacteria. For endotoxin\nmeasurement, filters were extracted according to the\nmethods described by Spaan et al. [16]. The extraction\nsolution was then transferred into pyrogen-free tubes and\ncentrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g for 15 minutes. Supernatant was\ncollected, vortexed and aliquots examined using the Pyro-\nGene rFC Endotoxin detection kit (Lonza Wokingham\nLimited, UK). To assess the potential for the environmen-\ntal endotoxin to induce inflammatory responses,\nextracted endotoxin solutions were added to cultures of\nhuman airway epithelial and monocyte cells. After 24 h of\nincubation, the cell culture supernatants were harvested\nand stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis for the release of inter-\nleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 into the supernatants by the Duo-\nSet\u00ae sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's instructions\n(R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK).\nResults and discussion\nEndotoxin was not detected in samples taken upwind of\nthe facility but was consistently detected in on site sam-\nples, both during periods of composting processing and\nperiods where there was no site activity. Measurements\ndownwind of the site showed a pattern of peaks and\ntroughs (secondary peaks at 100-150 m and 280 m)(Fig-\nure 1). Culturable bioaerosol concentrations were typi-\ncally below the limit of detection in upwind samples\nexcept for actinomycetes which are a significant compo-\nnent of the background microbiota of ambient air at this\nlocation. The highest concentrations were measured close\nto on-site composting activities and as with endotoxin,\non-site concentrations of bioaerosols were consistently\nlower during periods when site activity ceased (example\nfor A. fumigatus in Figure 2). Culturable bioaerosol con-\ncentrations decreased to 80 m followed by a second peakPage 2 of 4\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nEnvironmental Health 2009, 8(Suppl 1):S9 http:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/8\/S1\/S9at 100 m. In contrast to the endotoxin findings there was\nno secondary peak for culturable bioaerosols at 280 m.\nThere were similarities in the patterns of emission and dis-\npersal of culturable bioaerosols and endotoxin (Figures 1\nand 2). Bioaerosol emission peaks associated with com-\nposting operations have previously been described by\nTaha et al [7] and Albrecht et al [1] for culturable microor-\nganisms. On-site concentrations of all bioaerosols were\nconsistently lower during periods when site activity\nceased, confirming that agitation activities have a signifi-\ncant effect on emission. In all cases bioaerosol concentra-\ntions decreased sharply with downwind distance from the\nemissions source to the sampling point 80 m downwind\nof the site boundary. The rapid dispersion of bioaerosols\ndownwind of composting facilities has been reported in\nprevious studies [17]. All data sets showed a second peak\nin bioaerosol concentrations at 100-150 m. This phenom-\nenon was not expected. It is possible this is a local effect\ncaused by site topography\/features which may influence\nplume dynamics (there is a bund and tree line close to this\nsampling location). However, further sampling at another\ncomposting site has produced similar findings (data not\nshown). The detection of endotoxin at elevated quantities\nup to 280 m from the site boundary was unexpected and\nto the authors' knowledge, has not been reported previ-\nously. This could be caused by a second source of endo-\ntoxin or a transport mechanism that is different to that of\ncellular bioaerosols. Quantities of endotoxin measured\non site were consistently below 50 EU m-3, a suggested\nthreshold level for occupational exposure in the Nether-\nlands [18]. Extracted endotoxin induced inflammatory\ncytokine release from human cell cultures in a dose-\ndependent manner. However, cytokine release was mini-\nmal at concentrations less than ~50 EU m-3, supporting\nthis level as a cut-off value for potential health effects. To\nour knowledge, there are no other reports of extracted\nendotoxin from such facilities being investigated for bio-\nlogical effects [19].\nConclusion\n1. The release and dispersal of endotoxin from compost-\ning operations has been quantified for the first time.\nEndotoxin was not detected in upwind samples but was\ndetected consistently in on site samples confirming com-\nposting as a source. Concentrations were significantly\nhigher during composting activities compared to periods\nof no activity. Downwind measurements showed a pat-\ntern of peaks and troughs suggesting complex dispersal\ndynamics. Detection of elevated concentrations at dis-\ntance from the site boundary was unexpected but it was\nnot possible to confirm that composting was its source.\n2. Extracted endotoxin (>50 EU\/m3) can induce signifi-\ncant inflammatory cytokine production from human\ncells. Endotoxin levels below 50 EU\/m3 did not induce a\nsignificant inflammatory response and this value might be\nused as a tentative limit for airborne endotoxin at these\nsites.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAspergillus fumigatus concentrations presented in CFU m-3Figure 2\nAspergillus fumigatus concentrations presented in \nCFU m-3.
