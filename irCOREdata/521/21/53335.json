Conclusions \n1. Introduction \nDiscussion of the ways in which police powers have been modified to deal with \nterrorism, or the fear of terrorism, needs to be placed in the context of both the \nimmediate concerns which have led to recent legislation, and the longer historical \ncontext. The immediate concerns date back to the attack on the World Trade Centre in \nNew York, in September 2001 (\u20189\/11\u2019). This has been followed by the bombings in \nBali in 2002, Madrid in 2004 and London in July 2005. All of these events have been \nattributed to Al Qa\u2019ida, and have contributed to the fear of unpredictable attacks on \nthe civilian population by suicide bombers. It has been suggested that the situation is \none in which the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 have changed,1 and that this justifies increasing \nthe powers of the police and security services. \n The broader historical context requires us to remember that the United Kingdom \nhas over 30 years experience of dealing with terrorism. From the late sixties until the \nlate 1990s there were very real threats on the mainland of the United Kingdom from \nIrish terrorism, as well as the significant problems in Northern Ireland itself.  Our \ncurrent terrorism legislation has its origins in legislation passed in the 1970s to deal \nwith this area.  Other countries within Europe have faced similar problems \u2013 for \nexample Spain has had to deal with the Basque separatist movement, ETA, and \nFrance suffered from its colonial legacy in relation to Algeria. Terrorism is not \nsomething which started in September 2001, and we should be prepared to learn the \nlessons of past experience. Two points resulting from the UK\u2019s experience of dealing \nwith Irish terrorism are particularly pertinent to the current discussion. First, extended \ndetention without trial is likely to be counterproductive. The use of internment in \nNorthern Ireland is generally regarded as having contributed to recruitment to the \nIRA.2  The use of prolonged detention without trial under the Anti-Terrorism Crime \nand Security Act (discussed further below), and the continuing detention by the US of \nthose apprehended during the Afghanistan conflict at Guantanamo Bay, are likely to \nhave had similar effects as regards recruitment to \u2018Islamic\u2019 terrorist groups. Secondly, \nwe should not be complacent that our legal system is able to protect the innocent \nagainst over-enthusiastic policing. The celebrated \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 cases of the \nlatter years of the 20th Century, arising out of the attempts to respond to pressure to \nfind the perpetrators of various bomb outrages related to the Irish conflict (the \nBirmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven), show that it is possible for \npeople to end up serving long prison sentences for offences which they did not \ncommit.  \n It may well be argued that the current situation is different, in that the terrorism is \nmore international, and thus more unpredictable, and that the use of suicide bombers \nis a particularly insidious threat.  IRA bombs were generally preceded by warnings, \nthough these were not always adequate to protect lives; Al Qa\u2019ida attacks without \nwarning. All this is true, but does not in the end detract from the lessons which should \nhave been learnt from earlier experience.  \n \n2. The European Context \nIn looking at the European context of the battle against terrorism, the actions of both \nthe European Union and the Council of Europe need to be considered.  \n As regards the European Union a Council Framework Decision on Combating \nTerrorism was issued in 2002.3 The preamble noted that \u2018terrorism constitutes a threat \nto democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and to economic and social \ndevelopment\u2019,4 and that  \n \nThe definition of terrorist offences should be approximated in all Member States, \nincluding those offences relating to terrorist groups. Furthermore, penalties and \nsanctions should be provided for natural and legal persons having committed or \nbeing liable for such offences, which reflect the seriousness of such offences.5\n \nAt the same time, paragraph 10 of the preamble reaffirmed the Union\u2019s respect for  \n \nfundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of \nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they emerge from the \nconstitutional traditions common to the Member States as principles of Community \nlaw. \n \nAs will be seen below, the Framework Decision puts forward a definition of \nterrorism, but there is nothing in it which requires any particular extension of police \npowers to deal with this type of activity.  \n The Framework Decision was followed by a Declaration on Combating Terrorism, \nof March 2004, issued in response to the Madrid bombings, and an Action Plan, \nagreed in June 2004.6 The Action Plan was directed at improving international co-\noperation in relation to counter-terrorism measures, and in particular attacking the \nfunding of terrorism. \n The Council of Europe has also responded to the increased threat from terrorism by \nputting forward the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism in May 2005. This has \nbeen signed by the majority of states of the COE, but at the time of writing has not \nbeen ratified by any, and so is not yet in force.7 The objective of the Convention is set \nout in Article 2: \n \nThe purpose of the present Convention is to enhance the efforts of Parties in \npreventing terrorism and its negative effects on the full enjoyment of human rights, \nin particular the right to life, both by measures to be taken at national level and \nthrough international co-operation, with due regard to the existing applicable \nmultilateral or bilateral treaties or agreements between the Parties. \n \nAs with the European Union, a principal focus is on the improvement on international \nco-operation, but the Convention does included some commitments in terms of \ndomestic law. Article 5, for example, requires Parties to adopt measures to criminalise \n\u201cpublic provocation to commit a terrorist offence\u201d, and Articles 6 and 7 do the same \nas regards recruitment and training for terrorism.8 At the same time, the Convention \nrecognises the need to ensure that human rights continue to be respected. Article 12 \nrequires parties to ensure that the criminalisation of activity under the articles \nmentioned above is carried out \u201cwhile respecting human rights obligations, in \nparticular the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of \nreligion,\u201d (as set out in Articles 10, 11 and 9, respectively, of the European \nConvention on Human Rights).  Moreover, Article 12.2 of the Convention on the \nPrevention of Terrorism requires any new laws to be subject to \u201cthe principle of \nproportionality, with respect to the legitimate aim pursued and to their necessity in \ndemocratic society, and should exclude any form of arbitrariness or discriminatory or \nracist treatment.\u201d \n In addition, of course, counter-terrorist actions need to be compatible with various \nother obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, including Article \n2 (right to life), Article 3 (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment), \nArticle 6 (right to a fair trial), Article 8 (respect for private life, home and \ncorrespondence). In the UK this requirement of compatibility arises not only from the \nECHR itself, but also from the Human Rights Act 1998. \n The European context thus illustrates the tension that exists between the need to \ntake measures against terrorism and the need to respect human rights. The best \napproach to resolving this tension is discussed in section 4 of this article, in \nconnection with the specific provisions modifying police powers. \n \n3. Definitions of terrorism \nIn order to target provisions of the criminal law correctly there is a need to define \nwhat is meant by \u201cterrorism\u201d. Two attempts to do this will be considered here \u2013 one \ncontained in the European Framework Decision, and the other in the Terrorism Act \n2000. They have similarities, in that both attempt to define terrorism in terms of \ncertain types of criminal offence, committed for a specified purpose or range of \npurposes.  \n3.1 The Framework Decision \nThe Framework Decision, lists various specific offences which have the capability of \nbeing \u2018terrorist offences\u2019 \u2013  namely \n\u2022 assaults (lethal or otherwise) \n\u2022 kidnapping\/hostage-taking \n\u2022 destruction of property (including \u2018information system\u2019) \n\u2022 seizure of ships, aircraft, etc \n\u2022 dealing, research in weapons, explosives, etc \n\u2022 release of dangerous substances \n\u2022 interfering with water, power supply, etc \n\u2022 threatening to commit any of the above \nThese offences become terrorist offences if committed with the aim of \n \n\u2022 seriously intimidating a population, or \n\u2022 unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform \nor abstain from performing any act, or \n\u2022 seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political \nconstitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international \norganisation. \n3.2 The Terrorism Act 2000 \nAs far as English law is concerned, s. 1 of  the Terrorism Act 2000 (\u2018TA 2000\u2019) \ndefines terrorism as: \n \n (1) . . . the use or threat of action where\u2014 \n  (a) the action falls within subsection (2), \n  (b) the use or threat is designed to influence the \ngovernment or [an international governmental organisation] or to intimidate \nthe public or a section of the public9, and \n  (c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a \npolitical, religious or ideological cause. \n (2) Action falls within this subsection if it\u2014 \n  (a) involves serious violence against a person, \n  (b) involves serious damage to property, \n  (c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person \ncommitting the action, \n  (d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public \nor a section of the public, or \n  (e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to \ndisrupt an electronic system. \n \nIf firearms or explosives are used, then the requirement in s. 1(1)(b) does not need to \nbe satisfied (s. 1(3) ). The offences are defined more broadly than in the European \nFramework document, but clearly cover similar areas. \n There is a danger that actions taken in connection with a broad range of political \nprotests could come within this definition, though at the time the Act was passed the \ngovernment was at pains to insist that it would not catch \u201clawfully organised \nindustrial action in connection with a legitimate trade dispute\u201d.10 The problem is that \ndemonstrations which may begin peacefully may at times lead to damage to property, \nand injury to individuals. Should they thereby fall to be treated as \u201cterrorist offences\u201d? \nThere is also the question of how s. 1(2)(d) is interpreted. The phrase \u201ca serious risk \nto the health or safety of the public or a section of the public\u201d could be taken to cover \na wide range of behaviour. Again, an interpretation which takes into account the \nprime targets of the Act will be needed to avoid the inappropriate use of the extended \nterrorist powers.  \n Section 1(1)(e) has similarities to the reference in the Framework definition to the \ndestruction of \u201cinformation systems\u201d. This is designed to cover interference with \ncomputer systems. It would not, presumably, generally cover the hacking of a system \nowned by a private company, because such action would not be intended to \u201cinfluence \ngovernment or to intimidate the public or a section of the public\u201d. It would be \notherwise if, for example, the home page of a widely used internet service provider \nwas \u201ctaken over\u201d and used to distribute threats of bomb attacks, or other violent \naction. Where government computer systems are the target, however, much less \nserious behaviour might be caught. An anti-war group which hacked into the Foreign \nOffice web site and posted notices hostile to the war in Iraq which appeared to \nemanate from the British government, might well fall within the definition. The action \nwould be \u201cdesigned to influence the government\u201d and might well be regarded as \nseriously disrupting an \u201celectronic system\u201d.  Should such behaviour be treated as \nterrorism? \n The conclusion from looking at these definitions must be that it is difficult to \nformulate a definition which is precisely targeted. Much then depends on exactly how \nthe law is used in practice. Ensuring that it is not used \u201cdisproportionately\u201d, as \nrequired by both the ECHR and the European Convention on the Prevention of \nTerrorism, rests in part with the legislature, but also with the police, Crown \nProsecution Service, and all other officials concerned with the application of the legal \nrules.  \n \n4. Modification of Police Powers \nIn a number of areas, the British government has extended police powers in relation to \nsuspected terrorism. The areas that will be considered here are: stop and search; arrest \n\u2013 including the use of (lethal) force; and detention before charge.  Before looking the \ndetails of these modifications, however, the question of the \u201cbalance\u201d between liberty \nand security is considered.  \n4.1 The question of \u201cbalance\u201d \nWhere a government is led to take steps to minimise the threat from a terrorist enemy \nthat uses unpredictable means to strike directly at civilian targets, the consequent \nreduction in freedoms is often discussed in terms of \u201cbalance\u201d. We must balance our \nfreedoms against the need for security. As Hayes (2005) has argued, this approach is \nmisleading, and unhelpful.11 It suggests that governments are entitled simply to \nreduce human rights if it will lead to a more secure society. Freedom and security are \nregarded as being of equal value, with one being able to be traded off against the \nother. This is not acceptable in a society which aspires to democracy, and the human \nrights\u2019 principles which underpin that concept. Rather than \u201cbalance\u201d, the concept that \nshould be used is one of necessity. The question that should be asked is, given the \nnature of the threats, what are the minimum steps which are necessary to respond to \nthem. Individual freedom should only be restricted when there is a real and pressing \nneed to do so, not simply when it might be regarded as helpful to the police and \nsecurity services.  Lord Hoffmann in A v Secretary of State,12 considering the \nexceptional powers of detention without trial which were being challenged in that \ncase,  expressed the view that:13\n \nThe real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in \naccordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism \nbut from laws such as these. That is the true measure of what terrorism may \nachieve. It is for Parliament to decide whether to give the terrorists such a victory. \n \nMaintaining freedom in a stable and unchallenged society is easy.  What is more \ndifficult is to maintain respect for freedoms when a society is facing serious \nchallenges, and to ensure that any restriction of those freedoms is at the minimum \nlevel necessary for the situation. With those considerations in mind, we turn the \nparticular modifications to police powers which the British government has enacted in \norder to deal with the perceived terrorist threat, both before and after 2001. Do these \nmodifications affect civil liberties to the minimum extent necessary? Are they \ncompatible with the rights contained in the ECHR? \n \n4.2 Stop and Search \nIn relation to stop and search, under s. 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 there is a power \nin a fairly standard form, of a kind which is found in relation to drugs, offensive \nweapons, stolen goods, etc. This enables a police officer to stop and search a person \non reasonable suspicion that he or she is a terrorist. The purpose of the search will be \nto discover whether the person has in his or her possession anything which may \nconstitute evidence of that fact.  \n A broader set of powers, not based on reasonable suspicion is contained in ss. 44-\n47 of the  TA 2000.14 These powers permit random and routine searching for limited \nperiods, and within a specified area. The powers cover the stop and search of vehicles \nand their occupants (s. 44(1)); and the stop and search of pedestrians and anything \ncarried by them (s. 44(2)). The powers are initiated by the issue of an \u201cauthorisation\u201d.  \nThis must be given by a very senior officer: in London, of the rank of commander or \nabove; outside London, of the rank of assistant chief constable, or above. The grounds \nfor issuing the authorisation are that it appears to the officer concerned that \u201cit is \nexpedient to do so\u201d in order to prevent acts of terrorism. There is on the face of it no \nneed for the officer to show \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for his belief that the powers are \nneeded but, in R(Gillan) v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis,15 the House of \nLords expressed the view that \u201cit goes without saying\u201d that the officer\u2019s decision must \nbe \u201creasonable\u201d.16 The word \u201cexpedient\u201d was also considered. The applicant \nsuggested that this meant \u201cnecessary\u201d. The House of Lords disagreed. Given the \nsafeguards surrounding the exercise of the power, the word should be interpreted as \nmeaning that the person giving the authorisation considers it likely that the stop and \nsearch powers \u201cwill be of significant practical value and utility in seeking to\u201d prevent \nacts of terrorism.17   \n An authorisation must be notified to the Home Secretary, who has the power to \ncancel it, or shorten the period for its operation (s. 46). The period of an authorisation \nunder this Act may be up to 28 days. Moreover, an authorisation may be extended for \nfurther periods of up to 28 days (s. 46). The geographical scope may cover the whole \nof the relevant police area, or any part of it. \n Once in force the authorisation empowers any constable in uniform to stop any \nvehicle or pedestrian. Any vehicle or person (including the occupants of a vehicle) \nstopped under these powers may be searched for 'articles of a kind which could be \nused in connection with terrorism' (s. 45). This is a very broad definition, which in \npractice imposes no restriction on the type of search which the officer will be able to \ncarry out. A person who refuses to stop, or wilfully obstructs the exercise of these \npowers, commits a summary offence under s. 47. \n As noted above, these powers authorise random and routine searches. There is no \nneed for \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for the carrying out of a search (s. 45(1)).  The \nextensive and intrusive nature of these powers is presumably felt to be justified by the \nthreats imposed by terrorist activity. They place, however, very considerable powers \nin the hands of senior police officers, with very little opportunity for supervision by \nthe courts. The only independent control of the powers comes from the Home \nSecretary's supervision of authorisations. The powers have been used extensively in \nLondon. Authorisations under s. 44 were in place for the whole Metropolitan Police \nDistrict from the date that the relevant sections of the 2000 Act came into force (19 \nFebruary 2001), until September 2003. The use of the power in this way was \napproved by the House of Lords in R (Gillan) v Commissioner of Police for the \nMetropolis. Provided that the proper authorisation procedures have been followed, \nand informed consideration given to the need for renewal, rather than it being a \n\u201croutine bureaucratic exercise\u201d,18 then it is permissible for there to be a series of \nrenewals. \n The House also considered in Gillan, whether the use of the powers involved a \npotential breach of Art. 5 of the ECHR.  The argument here is whether a stop and \nsearch involves sufficient deprivation of liberty to engage Article 5. The House, \nrelying on the principles set out by the European Court of Human Rights in Guzzardi \nv Italy,19 recognised that each situation must be judged on its merits, but took the \nview, as Lord Bingham put it, that:20\n \nthe procedure will ordinarily be relatively brief. The person stopped will not be \narrested, handcuffed, confined or removed to any different place. I do not think, in \nthe absence of special circumstances, such a person should be regarded as being \ndetained in the sense of confined or kept in custody, but more properly of being \ndetained in the sense of kept from proceeding or kept waiting. There is no \ndeprivation of liberty. \n \nThis does not mean that a stop and search could never engage Article 5 \u2013 just that \nthere would be have to some factor which went beyond the normal routine for it to do \nso. The facts of Gillan were that one applicant had been stopped and search while on \nthe way to attending a demonstration outside an international \u201carms fair\u201d being held \nin East London. The second applicant had been a journalist on her way to take \nphotographs of the demonstration, and was also stopped and searched under the \nterrorism powers. They both sought judicial review of this use of the power, which \ndid not seem to be directly linked to terrorism. The Court of Appeal expressed \nconcerns at the lack of evidence that the police had been properly briefed on the use \nof terrorism powers, and that they should only be used in relation to terrorism.21 The \nHouse of Lords, however, refused to deal with the facts of the individual cases, on the \nbasis that these issues were inappropriate for consideration in the type of action which \nthe applicants had brought (that is, judicial review). The focus of this type of action \nwas the legality of the authorisation, rather than the particular use of the power in \nindividual circumstances. The use of the power was better challenged via a civil \naction for assault or false imprisonment.22\n The facts of Gillan show the potential for the misuse of these powers, with their \nemployment outside the area of suspected terrorism. The decision of the House of \nLords, however, also shows the courts\u2019 reluctance to intervene in a general way, so as \nto find that what could be very useful and appropriate powers, were always going to \nbe incompatible with Convention rights. Each case will have to be looked at on its \nmerits to see whether the use of the power was or was not disproportionate. This puts \na considerable burden on the police officer on the street, and this is a point to which \nfurther reference will be made later.  \n4.3 Arrest \nSince 1974, when the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 was \nenacted in response to the problems of Irish terrorism as it affected the British \nmainland, English law has contained special arrest powers to deal with terrorism. The \nlatest version of these powers is to be found in the Terrorism Act 2000.  \n By virtue of s. 41(1) \u201ca constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom he \nreasonably suspects to be a terrorist\u201d. Section 40 of the Act defines a terrorist as a \nperson who either (a) has committed an offence under certain sections of the Act, or \n(b) \u201chas been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of \nterrorism\u201d. To the extent that arrest is based on reasonable suspicion of having \ncommitted an offence there is no need for the power under s.41. Under the Police and \nCriminal Evidence Act, s. 24,23 a police officer may arrest on reasonable suspicion \nrelating to any offence. It is where the suspicion relates to behaviour falling within \n(b), that s. 41(1) becomes important, and extends the normal arrest powers. . Although \nacts of \u201c'terrorism\u201d will almost certainly involve the commission of an offence, what \nis unusual here is that the police need have no particular offence in mind; nor need \nthey worry overmuch about the level of involvement of the person arrested. \u201cBeing \nconcerned in\u201d is wider than being actively involved in the commission of a terrorist \nact, or being a conspirator, or attempting to commit such an act.  In particular, it \nallows police to arrest on the basis of intelligence information that a person has links \nwith terrorist organisations, or with other individuals who are themselves suspected of \nbeing involved in terrorism. It is important to remember that this may be the first \nstage of up to 28 days\u2019 detention without charge, during which time the police may \nquestion the person arrested with a view to obtaining valuable information about \nterrorist activities, and activists, rather than acquiring the evidence necessary for a \ncharge to be brought. That this is the way the power has been  used seems to be \nconfirmed by figures showing that over 80 per cent of those detained under this \npower, or one of its predecessors, between 1980 and 1990 in connection with \nNorthern Ireland terrorism, were released without charge. In more recent years, the \npercentage of detentions which result in further action has been even smaller. During \nthe years 1991 to 1995, 560 people were detained, but only 49 (8.75 per cent) were \ncharged, and another 19 (3.4 per cent) excluded or deported.24 In 2000 only seven \npeople were arrested under s. 41 in connection with Irish terrorism, of whom only one \nwas charged with an offence. Thirty-nine people were arrested in connection with \ninternational terrorism, of whom 25 were charged with offences (but only eight with \noffences under the terrorism legislation).25 These figures seem to confirm that the \nmain use of the terrorism powers is now moving from Irish to international terrorism. \nThis is likely to have continued post-9\/11. The Home Office has not, however, \npublished the relevant figures in subsequent years. \n It is up to the police and prosecutors to ensure that only behaviour which really \nmerits the use of this special arrest power provided by s.41 is brought within its scope. \nThe power of arrest under s. 41 is an exceptional one, and should only be exercised \nwhere it is really necessary to do so.26 Could its use be challenged under the Human \nRights Act 1998?  In Lawless v Ireland,27 the European Court of Human Rights \nemphasised that the purpose of arrest under Art. 5(1)(c) of the ECHR must be to bring \nthe arrested person before a competent judicial authority. This was confirmed in \nBrogan v United Kingdom,28 which was concerned with the equivalent of s. 41 of the \n2000 Act under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984. In \nBrogan, however, the Strasbourg Court stated that the fact that those arrested are not \ncharged, nor brought before a court, does not necessarily mean that the purpose of the \narrest was out of line with Art. 5(1)(c). There was no need for the police to have, at \nthe time of the arrest, sufficient evidence to bring charges. As the Court then \ncommented:29\n \nThere is no reason to believe that the police investigation in this case was not \nin good faith or that the detention of the applicants was not intended to further \nthat investigation by way of confirming, or dispelling, the concrete suspicions \nwhich, as the Court has found, grounded their arrest. \n \nThis approach by the Court makes it harder for a person arrested under s. 41 of the \n2000 Act to argue that the arrest falls outside the scope of what is permitted under \nArt. 5(1) because it is being used to gather intelligence. As has been suggested above, \nthe figures indicate that this is the common way in which this particular power is \nused. \n4.4 Use of force in relation to arrest   \nThe particular problem of the suicide bomber has brought to the forefront of \ndiscussion the issue of the amount of force which the police or security services may \nuse in arresting a suspected terrorist.  The Metropolitan Police has been reported as \nadopting a \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d policy.30 The killing of an innocent young  Brazilian man, \nJuan Carlos Menenez, on 22 July 2005 illustrated the problem to tragic effect. He was \nshot by members of the police as he sat on a tube train. He had apparently been \nsuspected of being a suicide bomber. At the time of writing the events are still under \ninvestigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.  \n The legal position as to what the police may or may not do in such a situation is \ngoverned by the common law, two provisions in British statutes, and Article 2 of the \nECHR. \n4.4.1 British Law \nThe first statutory provision to note is s. 117 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act \n1984. This empowers a police officer to use \u201creasonable force\u201d in the exercise of any \nof the powers under the Act, including the power of arrest for any offence. The \nquestion that immediately arises is \u201cwhat is reasonable?\u201d, and in particular can it ever \nbe reasonable to use lethal force. The answer must presumably be \u201cno\u201d, in that if the \nintention of the officer is to kill the suspect, then this cannot be said to be part of the \nexercise of a power of arrest, the object of which is to detain a live suspect. The \nposition would be different if the suspect was unintentionally killed as a result of \nforce which was genuinely used with the intention of apprehending the person, rather \nthan killing them. The question as to whether the force used had been reasonable \nwould then be a real issue. This has no relevance to a \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d policy. \n The second statutory provision is s. 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, which allows \nthe use of reasonable force in the prevention of crime. This overlaps with the common \nlaw defence of self-defence, which again permits the use of reasonable force by a \nperson who fears that he or she is under attack. In relation to both s. 3 of the Criminal \nLaw Act and the common law defence, English law adopts a mixed \u201csubjective\u201d and \n\u201cobjective\u201d approach to what is reasonable.  The subjective element is that the \ncircumstances are viewed through the eyes of the person using the force. In the \nsituations we are considering, the question should be \u201cWhat did this police officer \nbelieve to be happening? Did he or she genuinely think that this person was going to \nset off a suicide bomb?\u201d  In answering this question, reasonableness is irrelevant. The \npolice officer may have made a mistake \u2013 for example, thinking that a person carrying \na bag of books was actually carrying a bomb31 \u2013 but as long as that mistake is \ngenuinely made, it does not have to be shown to have been a reasonable mistake.32  \nOnce the circumstances, as believed to exist by the officer, have been established, \nthen the next part of the test is objective. The question is: \u201cGiven the circumstances \nthat the officer genuinely believed to exist, was the force used reasonable?\u201d  If it was \nreasonable to use lethal force, then the officer will be protected. English law thus \noperates in a way which is generally helpfully to the officer faced with a difficult \nsituation, requiring an immediate decision, and possibly immediate action. If, with \nhindsight, the situation was not as serious as the officer believed it to be, then this will \nnot be held against him or her. Provided the officer\u2019s reaction to the threat which he \nor she perceived to exist was reasonable, then the law provides protection for these \nactions. \n4.4.2 Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights \nAlongside the provisions of domestic law, however, the requirements of Article 2 of \nthe ECHR must be considered. Article 2 is concerned with the right to life. It imposes \nan obligation on the State, and on agents of the State (such as police officers), to have \nrespect for the right to life of all those within its jurisdiction. In the UK this obligation \nis reinforced by the Human Rights Act 1998, which imposes an obligation on \u201cpublic \nauthorities\u201d \u2013 and this will include the police \u2013 to act compatibly with the Convention \nrights.   \n Article 2 is not absolute, however. Paragraph 2 recognises that there may be some \nsituations where it may be justifiable to take a like, namely: \n \nDeprivation of  life  shall  not  be  regarded  as inflicted in contravention  of  \nthis article when it results from the use of force which is no more than  \nabsolutely necessary:  \na.  in defence of any person from unlawful violence;  \nb.  in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person  \nlawfully detained;  \nc.  in  action  lawfully  taken  for  the  purpose  of  quelling  a  riot  or  \ninsurrection. \n \nAs with s.117 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, sub-paragraph b. cannot \nlegitimise a \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d policy, though it would legitimise force which \nincidentally, but unintentionally, causes death.  Sub-paragraphs a. and c., however, \nmight be used to provide a defence in relation to the use of such a policy.  Article 2 \nappears to be more restrictive than the domestic provisions we have considered, in \nthat it refers to the force being \u201cno more than absolutely necessary\u201d, rather than what \nis \u201creasonable\u201d.  How has this been interpreted in practice?  The most relevant case \nfor our purposes is McCann v United Kingdom.33 This case arose out of a military \noperation in Gibraltar, in relation to a suspected bomb plot being carried out by \nmembers of the IRA.  Three suspects who were thought to be about to set off a bomb, \nwere killed by British soldiers, operating under cover. It transpired that none of the \nthree was carrying a bomb, or any device for setting-off a bomb, though they were all \npart of an IRA active service unit, which was involved with plans for planting of car \nbombs.  Their families took action against the British government, alleging a breach \nof Article 2.  The European Court of Human Rights held that the soldiers who had \nactually fired the shots had not acted in breach of Article 2. They had acted on the \nbasis of information which suggested that the suspects were about to set off a bomb \nby remote control. The use of lethal force to prevent them doing so was justified, even \nthough it turned out that in the event the information was inaccurate.  The Court did, \nhowever, find that there was a breach of Article 2 as a result of actions higher up the \nchain of command. The suspects had been under surveillance for a period, and it \nwould have been possible to intervene to neutralise any threat without need to resort \nto killing them. There were also deficiencies in the intelligence assessments, and the \ntraining given to the soldiers. Overall, the killings did not constitute the use of force \nwhich was no more than absolutely necessary in defence of persons from unlawful \nviolence.34\n On the issue of \u201cmistake\u201d the Court had this to say about the situation of the \nsoldiers who fired the shots:35\n \nThe Court accepts that the soldiers honestly believed, in the light of the \ninformation which they had been given\u2026that it was necessary to shoot the \nsuspects in order to prevent them from detonating a bomb and causing serious loss \nof life. \n \nThis appears to be adopting the same subjective approach as used in English law in \nrelation to the soldiers\u2019 state of mind \u2013 an honest belief is enough. However, later in \nthe same paragraph the Court in restating the position in more general terms said that: \n \nIt considers that the use of force by agents of the State in pursuit of one of the aims \ndelineated in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention may be justified under this \nprovision where it is based on an honest belief which is perceived, for good \nreasons, to be valid at the time but which subsequently turns out to be mistaken. \n[emphasis added] \n \nThis version effectively makes the test objective, by requiring the agent to have \nreasonable grounds for his or her belief. That this is the approach of the Court has \nbeen confirmed in two subsequent cases. In Andronicou and Constantinou v \nCyprus,36 the facts involved a police action to terminate a siege involving a hostage. \nThe Court ruled that:37\n \nThe Court cannot with detached reflection substitute its own assessment of the \nsituation for that of the officers who were required to act in the heat of the moment \nin what was for them a unique and unprecedented operation to save life. The \nofficers were entitled to open fire for this purpose and to take all measures which \nthey honestly and reasonably believed were necessary to eliminate any risk either \nto the young woman\u2019s lives or their own lives. \n \nThe Court thus recognises the difficulties for those put in a situation involving very \nquick decisions, but nevertheless requires that their assessment of the situation must \nbe reasonable. Similarly in G\u00fcl v Turkey,38which concerned an operation against a \nsuspected terrorist, the Court found that \u201cthe firing of at least 50-55 shots at the door \nwas not justified by any reasonable belief of the officers that their lives were at \nrisk\u201d.39 Once again, the test is stated objectively, in terms of \u201creasonableness\u201d. \n It seems, then, that the European Court of Human Rights, in interpreting Article 2, \nis imposing a higher standard on those who use lethal force in an attempt to deal with \nterrorist situations than is the case in English law.  The approach under English law is \nthat the person\u2019s view of the situation needs only to have been \u201chonest\u201d, and does not \nneed to be based on reasonable grounds; the force that can be used in that situation \nmust be reasonable. Under Article 2 of the ECHR, however, the view of the situation \nmust be based on reasonable grounds, and the force that is used must only be what is \n\u201cnecessary\u201d. Given that the Human Rights Act 1998 requires English courts to pay \nattention to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (though not \nnecessarily to follow it),40 it would seem that in assessing a situation where a member \nof the police or the armed forces has killed a suspected terrorist, the English courts \nshould apply the European tests. They should ask, in other words, whether the \nofficer\u2019s assessment of the situation was based on reasonable grounds, and then, \nwhether the force used was necessary in that situation. This would involve a departure \nfrom established prior authority, and it remains to be seen whether English courts will \nbe prepared to take that step.  \n Whichever approach is taken, however, it is clear that there cannot, under English \nlaw or under the European Convention, be a legitimate \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d policy, if this is \ntaken to mean that anyone who is a suspected terrorist may be subject to lethal force. \nEach situation must be assessed on its merits: only if the particular circumstances \njustify lethal force will its use be legitimised.  \n \n4.5 Detention before charge \nWhere a person has been arrested for an ordinary criminal offence, no matter how \nserious, the maximum period for which the person may be detained without charge is \n96 hours.  Where a person is held in relation to terrorism, different procedures apply, \nand much  longer periods of detention are possible. The rationale for this is not \nentirely clear, but is discussed below, following consideration of the powers \nthemselves.  \n The detention of people arrested under the terrorism provisions  is now governed \nby the provisions of s. 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and sch. 8 to that Act. Section \n41(3) allows an initial period of up to 48 hours from the time of arrest on the authority \nof the police. By virtue of s. 41(7) and sch. 8, as amended by the Terrorism Act 2006, \na further period of detention, up to 28 days from the time of arrest, may be granted by \nan appropriate judge. The period under the TA 2000  as originally drafter was 7 days, \nas it had been under the previous legislation; this was extended to 14 days by the \nCriminal Justice Act 2003. Following the bombings in London of 7 July 2005, the \npolice advised the government that an even longer period of detention would be \ndesirable. The government sought to extend the period to 90 days, but was defeated in \nthe Commons \u2013 with a period of 28 days being approved.  \n Under the pre-2000 terrorism legislation the power to permit extended periods of \ndetention was given to the Home Secretary. This led to problems with compliance \nwith Art. 5 of the ECHR, which are discussed below.  \n The grounds for authorising continued detention are that the review officer is \nsatisfied that it is necessary in order to preserve or obtain evidence which relates to an \noffence under the sections of the Act mentioned in s. 40(1)(a), or which indicates that \nthe detained person is or has been concerned with the commission, preparation or \ninstigation of acts of terrorism. The obtaining of evidence may be by questioning or \notherwise. In all cases the review officer, having given the detainee and the detainee\u2019s \nsolicitor the opportunity to make representation,41 must be satisfied that the relevant \ninvestigation or decision-making process is being conducted diligently and \nexpeditiously.42\n During the first 48 hours the position of the detainee is very comparable to that of a \nsuspected criminal detained under the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence \nAct 1984. The big change comes at the end of the 48-hour period. At that point, the \ndecision about continued detention passes to a judge. Under the 1989 Act, the power \nto extend detention rested with the Home Secretary, and appeared to be entirely at his \nor her discretion. The lack of any judicial review of this extended period brought the \nBritish government into conflict with the European Court of Human Rights, in the \ncase of Brogan v United Kingdom.43 There were four applicants who had been \ndetained, on the authorisation of the Home Secretary, for periods of between four \ndays and six hours, to six days and sixteen and a half hours. \n The European Court of Human Rights recognised the particular problems \npresented by terrorist offences. It also acknowledged that these difficulties might have \nthe effect of prolonging the period during which a person suspected of terrorist \noffences may, without violating Art. 5(3), be kept in custody before being brought \nbefore a judge. They might also result in special procedures in relation to judicial \ncontrol.44 Presumably the Court was referring here to possibilities such as the court \nsitting in camera, or dealing with the matter \u201cwithout notice\u201d (that is, hearing the \npolice case for detention but not giving the detainee an opportunity to rebut it at that \nstage). \n In the end, however, it had to be recognised that Art. 5(3) called for 'promptness' in \nbringing the detainee before a judge. This meant that the scope for flexibility was very \nlimited. It was the view of the Court, by a vote of 12 to 7, that even the shortest period \nof detention under consideration, that is four days and six hours, was too long to fit \nwith the notion of promptness. All four applicants had therefore been unlawfully \ndetained, in breach of Art. 5(3), and should have had an enforceable right to \ncompensation under Art. 5(5). \n The British government's initial response to this was to use the power under Art. 15 \nof the ECHR to derogate from the provisions of Art. 5(3) on the grounds of the public \nemergency in Northern Ireland. The legitimacy of this was confirmed by the \nEuropean Court in Brannigan and McBride v United Kingdom,45 and the derogation \nwas continued by the HRA 1998. The Terrorism Act 2000, however, while continuing \nto provide for extended detention of up to seven days, provided for judicial approval \nfor any detention over 48 hours. This met the requirements of Art. 5(3), so that once \nthe new provisions were in force, there was no need for the derogation to continue. It \nwas, therefore, lifted on 19 February 2001.  The current position, following the \namendments contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Terrorism Act 2006, \nis that an extension up to 14 days from arrest can be approved by a district judge; up \nto 28 days can be approved by High Court judge. In each case, the extension should \nbe for no more than seven days at a time. Although the period of detention is now \npotentially very long, it may well be that the ECtHR would not find any breach of Art. \n5, because of the requirement for regular judicial approval of the extensions.  \n What is the rationale for extended detention in terrorist cases? It cannot be simply \nthat such cases are more complex: serious fraud cases, for example, may be equally \ninvolved, and contain international elements. When the latest extension to the period \nfor detention was being debated in connection with the Terrorism Act 2006 the \ngovernment seemed to rely mainly on the argument that since the police had \nrequested the extension (to a maximum of 90 days) then it should be granted.  The \nissue was considered by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which \ntook evidence from the police and other interested groups.46 Its conclusion was that \nthe main reason behind the request for an extension of the powers was that:47\n \nnow so completely different, particularly in the magnitude of the potential harm \nand the indiscriminate nature of the targets, that public safety demands earlier \nintervention, with the result that there is less time available for investigation and \nevidence gathering prior to arrest. This means that in some extremely complex \ncases \u2018evidence gathering effectively begins post-arrest\u2019. A longer period of \nprecharge detention is therefore required in order to enable that evidence-gathering \nto take place. \n \nIn other words, the need to arrest early justifies the use of extended detention before \ncharge.  There were also some other factors to which the police drew attention,48 such \nas the international nature of modern terrorism, requiring enquiries to be undertaken \nin many jurisdictions, and \n \nthe frequent use of false identities, the need to employ interpreters, the need to \ndecrypt large numbers of computer hard drives and to analyse the product as well \nas disclose prior to interview, the need to make safe premises where extremely \nhazardous material may be found, the need to obtain and analyse communications \ndata from service providers, the need to allow time for religious observance by \ndetainees, and the fact that suspects often use one firm of solicitors which causes \ndelay in the process. \n \nAlthough all these factors may justify a longer period of detention pre-charge than for \n\u201cordinary\u201d crimes, the position prior to the Terrorism Act was that a terrorist suspect \ncould in any case be held for 10 days longer than any other detainee.  The Joint \nCommittee did not feel that a case had been made for any longer period of detention, \nand certainly not the 90 days that the police had been seeking. \n \n5. Conclusions \nEarlier in this article it was suggested that rather than trying to \u201cbalance\u201d the demands \nfor increased security against those of human rights, the approach should be to adopt \nthe minimum restrictions which are necessary. How does the United Kingdom\u2019s \nresponse match up to that standard?  As regards the area of stop and search, the \nspecial powers under s.44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 have received approval in \nprinciple (though not necessarily in relation to the manner of their use in particular \ncases) by the House of Lords in R(Gillan) v Commissioner of Police for the \nMetropolis. It does seem that it may be necessary in some situations to allow police \nofficers to stop and search people without needing to base their actions on \u201creasonable \nsuspicion\u201d. It is acceptable, for instance, that those wishing to use public transport \nmay in some cases be asked to allow their bags to be searched in a routine manner. \nWe already accept this in relation to air travel; the principles are no different in \nrelation to buses, trains, or underground systems.  It is up to the police, however, to \nensure that they do only make use of these powers in situations where it is necessary \nto do so. The circumstances that arose in Gillan suggest that this has not always been \nthe case.  \n In relation to arrest, the nature of terrorist activities is used to justify allowing \narrest on the basis of broader suspicion, and at an earlier stage in the process, than is \nthe case with other crime. Once again, the arguments of principle are persuasive \u2013 the \nproblems lie in the lack of safeguards to ensure that these powers are only used when \nreally necessary. As with stop and search, much depends on the individual police \nofficers taking the decision. The same is true to a large extent in relation to the use of \nlethal force. Here, however, as we have seen, there is no justification for a \u201cshoot-to-\nkill\u201d policy, though lethal force may be justified by particular situations. It is only \nwhere the circumstances mean that killing the suspect is the only way of averting a \nthreat that such force can be regarded as necessary. Moreover, the way in which the \ncourts deal with the defence of prevention of crime may need to be modified in order \nto make it compliant with the European Convention case law on Article 2. Doing so \nwill make the law operate slightly less favourably towards the officers exercising the \npower. \n Detention before charge is the area where the recent changes to the law in the UK \nappear to have least justification. While the arguments put to the Joint Committee on \nHuman Rights may well be sufficient to justify a longer period of pre-charge \ndetention for terrorist suspects, the case for the extension beyond 14 days has not been \nmade out with any strength.  Despite the requirement of regular judicial supervision, \nwhich provides some protection for the detainee, it cannot be said that this extension \nof powers meets the \u201cnecessity\u201d criterion.  \n It is understandable that the government has taken steps in relation to various \naspects of police powers to increase their scope in situations involving terrorism. In \ndoing so, however, it is often placing a very heavy responsibility on the individual \npolice officer. There is little evidence that there is adequate training and support \navailable to ensure that the officer uses the powers only where they are necessary, and \nnot merely because they are convenient, or even reasonable.  As regards detention \nbefore charge, the criticism goes further; the length of detention itself is open to \nchallenge, and not simply the use that may be made of it in particular cases.  \n In all these areas, once the immediate terrorist threat has become less pressing, \nreconsideration should be given as to the extent to which they are \u201cnecessary in a \ndemocratic society\u201d \u2013 it is to be hoped, though without much confidence, that a \ngovernment will feel able to amend or repeal some of them without the fear of \nseeming to be \u201cweak on terrorism\u201d. A strong government makes sure that it protects \nits citizen\u2019s fundamental rights, even when it is facing new and challenging threats, \nsuch as those posed by terrorism in the early 21st Century.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n1 The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has used this metaphor to justify measures \nwhich restrict civil liberties: Press Conference, 5 August 2005, accessible at \nhttp:\/\/www.number10.gov.uk\/output\/Page8041.asp. \n2 See, eg, Hillyard, P.
