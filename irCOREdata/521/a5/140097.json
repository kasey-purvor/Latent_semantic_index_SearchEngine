Findings from a study of UK boards\nreveal that women are significantly more likely to bring international diversity to their boards and to\npossess an MBA degree. New male directors are significantly more likely to have corporate board\nexperience, including CEO\/COO roles, while new female appointees are significantly more likely to\nhave experience as directors on boards of smaller firms. Our evidence contradicts the view reported\nby some chairmen that women lack adequate human capital for boardroom positions.\nKeywords\nCareers; Corporate boards; Corporate governance; Diversity; Female directors; FTSE 100; Gender;\nGlass ceiling; Human capital; Top management teams\nIntroduction\nRecent major corporate scandals such as Enron have turned public attention to the composition of\ncorporate boards of directors who are responsible for firm governance. One key issue in\ncorporate governance is the gender composition of corporate boards, highlighting the scant\nrepresentation of women, despite women making up half of the potential employee, customer and\nother stakeholder bases (Catalyst, 2004; Daily et al., 1999; Singh et al., 2007). New governance\nguidelines following the Cadbury Report (Cadbury, 1999) and the Higgs Review (Higgs, 2003) in\nthe UK called attention to the importance of diversity, including gender diversity, and the need to\nselect directors from a wider talent pool.\nSurveys of chief executives and chairmen in several countries in the 1990s reveal that women are\ngenerally perceived to lack the qualifications and experience required from directors (Ragins et\nal., 1998; Catalyst\/Opportunity Now, 2000). Women often report anecdotally that they have to be\ntwice as good as the men (e.g. American Novelist Fannie Hurst\u2019s famous quote, \u201cA woman has to\nbe twice as good as a man to go half as far\u201d (Quotedb, 2006), and unpublished quotes from\nour own studies; a female divisional board director of a FTSE 100 telecommunications firms\ncommented: \u201cIf I had been a man, I would be on the main board now\u201d, and a female\nengineering director shared, \u201cI\u2019ve always had a feeling that you have to be much better and more\ncommitted to be there as a woman.\u201d). Females aspiring to corporate boards therefore may be\ndriven to acquire more extensive human capital than their male counterparts in order to\novercome \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 barriers and to attract the attention of director selectors. However, the\ninterrupted nature of women\u2019s careers disadvantages women\u2019s human capital acquisition in\nterms of fewer chances to gain new job skills, management and work experience (Van Velsor and\nHughes, 1990).\nThe contribution of this paper is to examine the human capital of newly appointed directors in the\nUK and to establish that women directors do bring considerable and diverse human capital to\ntheir boards. We examine board human capital in an extreme gendered context, the UK\u2019s FTSE\n1002 firms, where the long-standing privilege of the old boy\u2019s network of directors stands in\nrange of the new calls for diversity in corporate governance. This paper argues that just as\nhuman capital theory is useful in describing why women have historically been absent from the\nboardroom, given the views traditionally held by chief executives and chairmen (whether or not\nthe women lacked human capital in reality), this theory is relevant in explaining recent\nappointments of new female as well as new male directors. Furthermore, as previous studies\nexamined the human capital of entire boards or of existing directors and as turnover of directors\nis a fairly slow process, we have little knowledge about the human capital introduced by new\nappointments.\nThis paper uses human capital theory to evaluate the profiles of 144 new men and women\nappointees to FTSE 100 corporate boards from 2001\u20134, and explores gender differences (here\nreferring to biological sex). In contrast to earlier studies (e.g. Hillman et al., 2002), we provide a\nrecent profile of new directors and in a unique country environment, the UK. This paper proceeds\nas follows. First, we highlight the increasing interest in director diversity, and review the extant\nliterature on human capital of directors of corporate boards. Based on human capital theory we\nsuggest five hypotheses to be examined, drawing on previous work that indicates where gender\ndifferences are likely. We then describe our sample and methods, and present our empirical\nresults. We conclude with a discussion of the contribution of the paper, some limitations,\nsuggestions for further research and implications for practice.\nDiversity on corporate boards\nLarge corporate boards in the US, UK and elsewhere have traditionally been composed almost\nentirely of males from similar backgrounds, forming an \u201cold boys club\u201d in and across the\nboardrooms of the private sector (Howe and McRae, 1991; Fondas and Sassalos, 2000). However,\nfollowing a wave of scandals, new governance codes (in the US, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and in the\nUK, the Combined Code) emerged, concerning the structures and processes of company boards and\nthe roles and responsibilities of independent directors (Aguilera, 2005). In the UK, there is strong\nconcern about the continuing strength and privilege of the \u2018old boys club\u2019 across FTSE 100 firms, in\nrelation to director appointments. The vast majority of non-executive director (NED) appointments\nwere made without formal advertisement, application or interviews. Hence the Higgs Review\n(2003) into the role of non-executive directors (NEDs; also referred to as \u2018outside directors\u2019) and the\nsubsequent Tyson Report (Tyson, 2003) called for greater transparency in director appointments\nand strongly recommended increased diversity in the pools of talent from which directors are\nrecruited.\nDiversity can take any number of forms, including personal demographics such as gender, race,\nethnicity and nationality (Erhardt et al., 2003). Diversity brings a number of benefits to boards,\nincluding new ideas and better communication (Milliken and Martins, 1996), debate (Fondas and\nSassalos, 2000; Pearce and Zahra, 1991) and corporate governance processes. Women display\ntransformational leadership styles (Rosener, 1990) and female board directors bring knowledge\nof female market segmentation (Daily et al., 1999). Female board members also serve as role\nmodels for younger women and symbolise career possibilities to prospective recruits (Bilimoria,\n2000). Roberts et al. (2005) report that non-executive directors value the openness and the\ninterplay of different perspectives and skills that diversity brought to the board. This business case\nleads us to expect that more diverse candidates would be welcomed onto corporate boards.\nHowever, women possess few insider director seats. As Table 1 indicates, the number of female\ndirectors on FTSE 100 boards has increased considerably over the past six years, other than as\n\u2018insider\u2019 executive directors, where women hold just 3.4% of seats. Women accounted for\n10.4% of all directors and 13% of all new appointments in 2006 (Authors, 2006).\nHuman capital of directors\nHuman capital theory (Becker, 1964) provides a convenient basis for understanding inequalities, and\nwe apply it here to explain the continued exclusion of women from corporate boardrooms. Human\ncapital can be linked with resource dependency theory (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978) which suggests\nthat, given an increasingly uncertain business environment, boards should be composed of\nindividuals who can provide access to a breadth of resources. Human capital theory is concerned\nwith how an individual\u2019s investments in education, knowledge, skills and experiences enhance\ncognitive and productive capabilities for the benefit of the individual and the firm (Becker, 1964;\nWestphal and Zajac, 1995). Just as with financial capital, investments in human capital produce\nrents for the individual, often in the form of higher and sustained pay levels and promotion\n(Tharenou et al., 1994). The rents are cumulative, so that by the time an individual seeks a\nboardroom appointment, he or she will usually have acquired substantial human capital over a\nnumber of years.\nTable 1 FTSE 100 Directorships and New Appointments\nFTSE 100 Directorships 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001\nNumber of Female-Held\nDirectorships\n117 121 110 101 84 75\n% of all Directorships 10.4% 10.5% 9.7% 8.6% 7.2% 6.4%\nNumber of Female Executive\nDirectors\n15 14 17 17 15 10\n% of all Executive Directorship 3.8% 3.4% 4.1% 3.7% 3.0% 2.0%\nFemale held Non Executive\nDirectorships\n102 107 93 84 69 65\n% of all Non-Executive Directorship 13.7% 14.5% 13.1% 11.8% 10.0% 9.6%\nTotal New Appointments 181 179 141 149 124 128\nNew Female Appointments 23 30 24 20 13 15\nNew Male Appointments 158 149 117 129 111 113\nFemale % of New Appointments 12.7% 16.8% 17.0% 13.4% 10.5% 11.7%\nAs each director brings a unique set of human capital resources to the board (Kesner, 1988), those\nwho select new board members may be interested in attracting individuals with particular human\ncapital resources to complement the board\u2019s existing capabilities. Characteristics of boards of\ndirectors receive increased scholarly attention (Johnson et al., 1996), but hitherto, research on\ndirectors and those in the upper echelons has focused on functional, age and educational\ndiversity, usually ignoring gender (e.g. Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Jensen and Zajac, 2004). In\nan increasingly globalised world, international experience provides firms with competitive advantage\n(Carpenter et al., 2001). Other extant research on human capital of board members is limited to\na small number of demographic variables (e.g. Burke, 1997) or to female-only studies (e.g. Burgess\nand Tharenou, 2000). A notable exception is Hillman et al. (2002) who draw on resource\ndependency theory and Hillman et al. (2000) taxonomy of director roles (insiders, business\nexperts, support specialists and community influentials) as human capital resources, thereby\nexpanding the usual binary view of inside and outside director roles. They examine patterns of\noccupational and educational differences amongst white and African-American men and women\ndirectors on Fortune 500 boards. Their study highlights the human capital of the whole\ncomplement of directors. Our study examines the human capital of the most recent cohort of\nnewly appointed directors, to identify the human capital currently being sought and acquired by\nFTSE 100 firms. The UK is an extreme and persistent gendered context. From the literature, a\nnumber of hypotheses are suggested that will allow us to consider how the human capital of\nthe new cohort of women and men directors may differ.\nDirector Education and Experience\nA consistent finding in previous research is that female directors have high levels of education\n(Burgess and Tharenou, 2002). Human capital investment in education, and particularly advanced\neducation, is a starting point for development of independent thinking, a key facet of role\nrequirements for non-executive directors, according to Roberts et al. (2005). Hillman et al.\n(2002) comment that minority groups can gain public and objective credentials through education,\nparticularly postgraduate qualifications, thereby levelling the playing field and compensating for the\neffects of any discrimination and subjective bias in selection and promotion. Educational qualifications\nare valued by the public and employers can then benefit from the expertise and credibility of the\neducational human capital of their staff and directors. An increasing number of women obtain\nhigher degrees, with female graduates now outnumbering their male counterparts in the US, UK and\nelsewhere (HESA, 2003). Becker (1962) suggests that individuals who are more able tend to invest\nmore in human capital such as education. Given that new women directors have successfully\nbroken through the glass ceiling, they could be said to visibly represent the more able of their\nfemale peers by dint of their top company director appointments. Furthermore, given that\ninvestment in advanced education can compensate for the effects of discrimination, we expect\nnew women directors to report more educational capital than will men.\nHypothesis 1: New women directors will be more likely to have higher educational\nqualifications than will new men directors.\nReputation is associated with human capital derived from investments in education and other\nvisible individual attributes that stand as proxies for the actual capabilities of the person (Hall et\nal., 2004). Individuals gaining directorships are likely to have acquired reputational capital that\nsignals competence and reduced risk to the beholders who use their social networks to select and\nappoint new directors. A noticeable factor in the profile of female directors in the FTSE 100 since\nthe 1980s is that significantly more women than men have titles, whether academic (Dr. or\nProfessor), aristocratic (Lady, Honourable), civic (Dame, Baroness), or political (Dame or\nBaroness), or Lady as consort title of an honoured man (Howe and McRae, 1991; Hypothesis 1:\nNew women directors will be more likely to have higher educational qualifications than will new\nmen directors. Authors, 2007). Mattis (2000) also describes a preference in the US for \u201cbranded\nwomen\u201d directors, including those with a degree from Ivy League universities, which signals\nupper-class status to senior managers (Zweigenhaft and Domhoff, 1998). The same could be said\nfor the reputational capital value of degrees from Oxford and Cambridge universities in the UK, which\nare well represented in the higher echelons of business and government.\nAnother facet of reputational capital is the extent to which directors appear in the press, and in\ndirectories of well-known people. As role models, these high profile women often make speeches\nor are featured in the press, so their names are likely to be picked up by internet search engines\nsuch as Google. We would suggest that the scarcity of such women may lead to higher levels of\nopportunities to engage in role modelling activities and more publicity than their male peers.\nHypothesis 2: New women directors will be more likely to have higher levels of reputational\ncapital than will new men directors.\nBecker (1962) emphasises the importance of on-the-job experience and training that raise the\nfuture productivity of the individual and his Nobel lecture (Becker, 1993) describes how earlier\ninequalities in the workplace can be explained by human capital theory. Previously, women were\nmore likely to work part-time or to settle for lower paid but convenient jobs, and hence would be\nless likely to participate in on-the-job training for more senior roles, as neither they nor their\nemployers would gain a reasonable return on the investment in training. But in recent times, women\nhave invested in education, and adopted a lifetime work pattern more similar to that of men. So\ntoday\u2019s female labour force are acquiring more senior level experience than did previous generations,\nand inequalities such as the gender pay gap are reducing, albeit slowly. However, very few women\nhave reached corporate board level positions in the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 firms.\nResearch into chief executives\u2019 views on the lack of women directors has, for many years, shown\nthat CEOs believe that there are not enough women with appropriate business experience (Burke,\n1997). This \u2018experience-based-bias\u2019 argument (see Bilimoria and Piderit, 1994) describes\nwomen\u2019s under-representation in leadership roles as based on a perceived lack of experience.\nCatalyst\u2019s 1995 survey of CEOs of US firms reports that the most frequently cited reasons for\nwomen\u2019s low representation on boards are the small number of women with appropriate business\nexperience (stated by 87% of manufacturing CEOs and 78% of services CEOs) and the view that\nwomen have not been in the pipeline long enough (Mattis, 2000). A UK study identifies similar\narguments, reporting 40% of CEOs believe that women had not been in the pipeline long enough,\ncompared to only 28% of senior women; a fifth of CEOs identify women\u2019s lack of significant general\nmanagement experience to be a major barrier (Catalyst\/Opportunity Now, 2000). If board\nexperience is an essential requirement for appointment, then the pool of talent with that\nparticular human capital is very small, and hence we expect that women in this cohort would\nhave less experience than their male peers.\nHypothesis 3a: New women directors will be less likely to have previous board experience than\nwill new men directors.\nIt is not just human capital acquisition of board experience that is valued, but board interlock\nresearch shows that executive experience is most sought in new director appointments, with\nthe expectation of rents for the hiring board in terms of competitive information and advantage\nderiving from those executive roles (Pearce and Zahra, 1992). Such knowledge and experience\ncontribute to the board\u2019s strategic role, enhancing the firm\u2019s competitiveness and returning value\nto the shareholders. Given that there are so few women in executive director roles such as chief\nexecutive, chief finance officer and chief operating officer, with a rise from 2.0% in 2000 to almost\n3.4% in 2006 in the proportion of women of all executive directors in FTSE 100 firms, and as\nwomen directors tend to be younger on average than their male peers by about three years\n(Authors, 2006), we anticipate that the new women directors have not yet acquired as much\nexecutive experience as the new men directors.\nHypothesis 3b: New women directors will be less likely to have top management team\nexperience than will new men directors.\nBoards of publicly-traded firms have a stewardship duty to appoint candidates who are well\nqualified for their director roles in order to secure the desired resources for the future of the\ncompany and its stakeholders, and to protect and develop firm assets (Aguilera, 2005). Hence\nall new directors are expected to have successful and relevant career experiences in their\nsectors and professions before their appointment. However, given that women are often more\nattracted to public and not-for-profit sector careers, we expect that women directors\u2019 work\nexperience human capital would be biased in favour of those sectors, in contrast to their male\npeers. We also expect women directors to have human capital which is different from their male\npeers in terms of professional background, with more male directors with career experience in\ntraditional \u201cmasculine-typed sectors\u201d where men comprise the majority of those employed, such as\nengineering and science.\nHypothesis 4a: New women directors will be more likely to have previous career experience in the\npublic and not-for-profit sectors than will new men directors.\nHypothesis 4b: New women directors will be less likely to have previous career experience in the\nmasculine-typed professions than will new men directors.\nGiven recent trends in globalisation and the increasing numbers of cross-national mergers and\nacquisitions of many large corporations, we expect that international experience will play an\nincreasingly important role as directors are being asked to monitor, govern and advise on corporate\nactivities and opportunities across a range of countries and different national and business cultures.\nInternational experience is regarded as highly developmental as it builds on and integrates other\nrelated human capital management experience acquired in the home environment. Indeed, Carpenter\net al. (2001) suggest that whilst this kind of human capital is rare even among chief executives, it is\nparticularly valuable for multinational firms where that experience is bundled with other potential\nresources (such as expanded personal and work social networks) to contribute to the firm\u2019s\ncompetitive advantage. Most FTSE 100 companies have value-added activities in several countries and\nare classified as multinationals. Daily et al. (2000) suggest that having international experience in\none\u2019s career portfolio may enhance the likelihood of achieving top executive positions in other\ncompanies, given that there is a positive relationship between outside CEO successors with\ninternational experience and performance. Interviews with forty FTSE 100 chairmen by Russell\nReynolds (2002) reveal that chairmen value international experience over gender and ethnic\ndiversity. However, it may be more difficult or less attractive for women to acquire this form of\nhuman capital. As Traditionally males are more internationally geographically mobile than females\n(Lyness and Thompson, 1997). Females are often the secondary earners in dual career relationships.\nFurthermore, international career experience represents a risk with uncertain returns on considerable\npersonal investment (Bolino, 2007). Based on the above reasoning, we expect that the new men\ndirectors would have acquired more human capital in the form of international experience than will\ntheir female peers.\nHypothesis 5: New women directors will be less likely to have international work experience than\nwill new men directors.\nMethodology\nData gathering\nWe downloaded the names of FTSE 1003 directors from the FAME and Hemscott databases on 1st\nOctober 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. This data was verified using past surveys of boards of directors\nand information available from the firms\u2019 investor relations\u2019 websites. This resulted in a list of 72 new\nfemale board appointees over the four-year period. A random sample of 72 new male appointees out of\n470 from the same time period was identified using an excel spreadsheet and random number\ngeneration. We tested to ensure there were no significant differences between this sample and the\nrest of the population. Using publicly available biographical information from annual reports, Who\u2019s\nWho, Debrett\u2019s People of Today and internet searches, we categorised the experience that the new\ndirectors brought to their boards. Individuals across the four years were treated as one group as\nthere were no significant between-year differences.\nVariables\nDemographics\nWe collected the Age, Gender and Ethnicity data for all respondents. Ethnicity (White or Non-\nWhite) was recorded on the basis of biographical details and photographs indicating a non-white\nbackground, with careful checking from press cuttings archives and other organisational websites,\ne.g. where individuals were directors or trustees or had made speeches at events identifying\nthemselves as having a non-white background.\nDirector Type\nWe recorded whether directors were inside\/executive or outside\/non-executive.\nEducation\nBiographies were examined for evidence of educational qualifications, including PhD, MBA, other\ndegrees and accounting qualifications. Note was also taken of degrees from elite institutions.\nNationality\nThe nationality of the new directors was recorded in the following categories: British, US\/Canadian,\nOther European, and Other. Nationality information is not always provided in biographical data,\nbut again further efforts were made to identify nationality from other sources than the official\nbiographies.\nReputation and Status\nWe captured the following variables: Title, Honour, Listing in Who\u2019s Who and Debrett\u2019s People of\nToday, Google hits by \u2018name\u2019 and \u2018director\u2019 (three distinct categories emerged: under 50 = low;\n50\u2013100 = medium, 100 + = high) and Oxbridge\/Ivy connections (not just degrees). This\nrequired checking for erroneous items, most of which were excluded by the introduction of \u201cdirector\u201d\nor \u201cboard\u201d into the search string. We have not seen other academic research apply Google hits\nbefore, but the major executive search consultancies in the UK increasingly use the number of\nsearch engine references as an indicator of reputation. We sought advice from expert search\nconsultants about the breakpoints for high, medium and low categories.\nBoard Experience\nWe recorded experience on other FTSE 100 boards, FTSE 101\u2013350 and Minor boards. We also\nrecorded experience on international boards outside the UK.\nTop Management Team Experience\nThe following five variables captured concurrent or past top management team experience: CEO, CFO,\nChief Operating Officer (COO) or General Manager (GM) or Managing Director (MD) experience, Chair\nexperience and Partner experience in consulting, law or accounting firms.\nCareer Experience\nSectoral experience was categorised as International, Financial Institutions, Management\nConsultancy, Public Sector, Voluntary\/Charity Sector, Other Government (membership on a\ngovernment advisory board, executive of a professional\/arts organisation). Professional experience\ncategories were Accounting, Law, Politics, Engineering, and Academia. We consider masculine-\ntyped career experience to be in industries where the majority of those employed are male, e.g.\nengineering institutions. Feminine-typed career experience is classified as experience in those\nindustries where there is a large female employment base, e.g. public sector.\nDirector Expertise Profiles\nWe drew on the categorisation of directors\u2019 human capital roles applied in earlier research by\nHillman et al. (2000, 2002) as the basis for human capital work experience variables. Two of the\nauthors placed each director into one of the four Hillman et al. (2000) categories (Insiders,\nBusiness Experts, Business Support Specialists and Community Influentials), and adjusted any\ndisagreements in discussion with the third author. It became clear that the business experts\ncategory masked some valuable public sector experience found in that group, particularly of the\nwomen. We therefore split that group into two. A fifth category, Business Experts AND Community\nInfluentials, was created to capture business experts with a \u2018portfolio\u2019 career of both business and\npublic experience.\nWe examined the differences between male and female directors. Findings are reported in cross-\ntabulation tables, and with t-tests and chi-square tests for significance.\nResults\nTable 1 reveals that in 2004 and 2005, women take around 17% of all new appointments, much\nhigher than the 10.5% female representation across all FTSE 100 directorships. However in 2006,\nwomen took only 13% of new appointments. The sample for this study includes all the new\nwomen and a random sample of the new men appointees from 2001 to 2004.\nTable 2 reports levels of education as revealed in the biographies. This group of recently\nappointed directors is very highly qualified, with a fifth of the men and a sixth of the women\nachieving doctoral qualifications. Interestingly, a fifth of the women have MBA degrees. Around\na third of the sample holds accounting qualifications, often not reporting a degree. A fifth of the\nwomen possess elite degrees compared to only a tenth of the men. Our Hypothesis 1 that new\nwomen appointees would hold higher educational qualifications than men is supported on one\nimportant dimension \u2013 the MBA. In our sample, females are significantly more likely to hold a MBA\ndegree (p < .03).\nTable 2 also shows that the new male directors are slightly more likely to hold a title. However,\nthe new women are more likely than the new men to be mentioned in Who\u2019s Who or Debrett\u2019s People\nof Today. There are no significant differences in Google reputations. Results indicate that female\ndirectors are no more likely than their male peers to have connections to Oxford or Cambridge or\nto an Ivy League university in the US. The similarities in the reputational capital of the new men and\nwomen entail that Hypothesis 2 is not supported.\nWe expected women to have less previous board experience than their male counterparts. Table 3\nreveals that almost half of the men have previous FTSE 100 director experience, but so did\nnearly a quarter of the women, and slightly more women than men have FTSE 101\u2013350 experience.\nHowever, women have significantly more minor board experience than the men, and somewhat\nmore experience on international boards. As so many of the new women appointees have\nprevious board experience, including on FTSE 100 boards, Hypothesis 3a is not supported except\nfor FTSE 100 experience, which is significant at the p = .006 level.\nTurning to previous top management team experience, results indicate that men are somewhat\nmore likely to have experience as a CEO (p = .08) and COO or GM or MD (p = .013). Hypothesis\n3b is therefore weakly supported. In addition, new male directors are significantly more likely\nthan females to have experience as chair of a board (p = .01 3).\nTable 2 New Director Appointments: Demographics, Education and Reputation\nMale\n(n = 72)\nFemale\n(n = 72)\nChi-square p Value\nEthnicity 98.6% white 9 5.8% white 0.620 1.029\nNationality 72% UK 61% UK 0.001 17.238\n7% USA\/Canada 32% USA\/Canada\n17% Other\nEuropean\n6% Other\nEuropean\n4% Other 1% Other\nEducation\nPhD 21% 16% 0.522 0.410\nMBA 7% 19% 0.027 4.911\nOther degree 30% 16% 0.074 3.184\nAccounting qualifications 30% 35% 0.475 0.511\nElite university degree 12% 21% 0.111 2.535\nNo information 40% 40%\nReputation\nTitle 23.6% 18.1% 0.539 0.674\nCivic Honour 16.7% 15.3% 1.000 0.052\nWho\u2019s Who\/Debrett 20.8% 31.9% 0.130 2.288\nGoogle UK mentions 25.0% Low 29.2% Low 0.134 4.027\n29.2% Medium 15.3% Medium\n45.8% High 55.6% High\nOxbridge\/Ivy League\nconnections\n20.8% 22.2% 0.839 0.041\nTable 3 New Director Appointments: Previous Board Experience\nPrevious Board\nExperience\nMale\n(n = 72)\nFemale\n(n = 72)\nChi-square test of\nsig p Value\nFTSE 100 45.8% 22.2% 0.006 10.303\nFTSE 101\u2013350 12.5% 16.7% 0.639 0.895\nMinor Board 38.9% 62.5% 0.005 8.029\nInternational Board 36.1% 43.1% 0.444 1.625\nPrevious Executive Director Experience\nPast CEO 41.7% 27.8% 0.080 3.064\nPast CFO 26.4% 25.0% 0.849 0.036\nPast COO\/GM\/MD 52.8% 37.5% 0.065 3.393\nPast Chair Experience 43.1% 23.6% 0.013 6.125\nPartner Experience 6.9% 12.5% 0.261 1.266\nTable 4 shows a number of significant results regarding previous career experiences. There are\nsectoral differences, with females significantly more likely to have a background in management\nconsultancy and the public and voluntary sectors, supporting Hypothesis 4a. There are also\nprofessional differences, with males significantly more likely to report a background in\nengineering, and females somewhat more likely to have been in financial institutions and the legal\nprofession. These findings also support Hypothesis 4b. About one in five new directors are\naccountants. Norburn (1984) reports that accountants are three times more likely to be\npromoted to a board than are production or manufacturing managers. Women in this sample with\naccounting qualifications find their way onto the top corporate boards in a similar proportion to their\nmale peers. Overall, these findings indicate that women are rather more likely to have a portfolio of\nexperiences in their career.\nHypothesis 5 predicted that women would have less international experience than women. Table 4\nreveals that this was only marginally the case, with 67% of male directors having this career\ncapital in their portfolio compared to 57% of their female peers. Only one new male director\ncomes from a non-white background (a black South African), compared to three females (one UK\nAsian and two African-Americans). We find that new male directors are more likely than female\ndirectors to hold British or other European citizenship, and new female directors are more likely to\nbe US or Canadian citizens. New female directors are significantly more likely than new males to\nhave non-UK citizenship.\nDirectors\u2019 human capital profiles\nWe next reviewed the above findings to examine human capital profiles and explore gender\ndifferences. For our analytical framework, we drew on the categories developed by Hillman et al.\n(2000, 2002) to group the directors by their human capital work experience. We find that the\nexpertise profile of the males and females was significantly different. Consistent with prior research,\nfemales were significantly less likely to be Executive Directors, but were no less likely than males to\nbe business experts. Women were, however, more likely to be business support specialists. More\nwomen than men fell into the community influential category, and over a quarter of the women in\nthe business expert category were additionally community influentials.

Women have been\npresent in the full-time workforce for many years. So why are women absent from a quarter of FTSE\n100 boardrooms and in token numbers in most of the others? Have women failed to accumulate\nsufficient relevant human capital? What role does human capital play in selection an appointment?\nPrevious research reports that chief executives and chairmen want women board members with\nprior board experience (Mattis, 2000), but there is still a perception that women with the \u2018right\u2019\nexperience are hard to find (Russell Reynolds, 2002).\nOur findings belie some of the myths about female directors not having sufficient experience,\nalthough female directors appear to have spent time on a wider variety of boards than have their\nmale peers. A somewhat unexpected finding is that almost a quarter of new female directors ap-\npointed between 2001 and 2004 already have FTSE 100 board experience. These women served\non top boards before retiring and then gaining appointments to different FTSE 100 boards, or\nacquiring concurrent directorships, as do five women (but only one man) in this sample. As the\nHiggs Review (2003) recommended that directors should not serve for more than two terms,\nthere may be increased director turnover. Hence, it is likely that the \u2018recycling\u2019 of a small group of\nexperienced directors will become a regular feature of female directorships as is the case for men.\nAs women are more likely than men to have experience on FTSE 101\u2013350 and minor boards,\nsmaller boards constitute an incubator talent pool for female FTSE 100 directors. Almost half of\nthe women have previous experience in financial institutions, a third have experience of senior\npositions in the public sector, and nearly a quarter have voluntary and charity organisations\nleadership experience. Many sat on government advisory bodies, and boards of arts and other\norganisations. These profiles follow Higgs\u2019 recommendation that boards extend the talent pool for\nboard appointments beyond directors with FTSE 100 experience.\nTable 5 New Director Appointments: Expertise Profiles\nExpertise Profiles Male\n(n = 72)\nFemale\n(n = 72)\nChi-square test\nof sig p\nValue\nBusiness Experts 54.2% 48.6% .738 .251\nComprised of:\nBusiness Experts with Community\nInfluential Expertise\n18.1% 26.4% .316 1.446\nBusiness Experts, no Community Expertise\nListed 36.1% 22.2% .281 1.584\nBusiness Support Specialists 8.3% 20.8% .057 4.516\nCommunity Influentials 4.2% 11.1% .208 .117\nExecutive (Inside) Directors 33.3% 19.4% .088 3.575\nIt is interesting that two thirds of males and well over half of the females in this study report\ninternational experience, and many women and men sat on boards in other countries. In 1984,\nNorburn reported that 65% of British executive directors had never worked outside the UK, and\nonly half of them thought that an overseas posting would be useful to further their career. Our\ncohort of directors represents diversity in terms of nationality, international work experience and\nboard experience, supporting the comments made by chairmen in the Russell Reynolds (2002)\nstudy that international diversity is very important in adding value to the board. Indeed, the women\nbring considerably different international diversity to their male peers. Women directors\u2019 human capital\nsymbolises an outward-looking and international capability of FTSE 100 boards.\nWe found the Hillman et al. (2000) taxonomy of four categories of directors (business experts,\nbusiness support specialists, community influentials and insiders) to be a useful way of examining\ndirector\u2019s biographies for evidence of human capital, but the category of business experts masks the\nadditional diversity that some female directors bring to the boardroom in terms of significant\nexperience from more than one major domain. We find that female business experts are more\nlikely than their male counterparts to have both business and community expertise. If we had\nkept the four category taxonomy, our business experts group would contain 54% of the males\n(compared to 89% found by Hillman et al., 2002), and 49% of the females (compared to 35%\nfound by Hillman et al., 2002). The women in the FTSE 100 study have more large corporate\nbusiness expertise than the Fortune 1000 women in the Hillman et al. (2002) study. This\nevidence refutes the view that women lack the \u2018right\u2019 human capital for directorships \u2013 women\ndirectors\u2019 balance of human capital assets may be different from the traditional male accumulation\nof knowledge, skills and experience, but that is the added value of diversity on corporate boards.\nAnother interesting finding is that female inside directors may also play a part in public sector\nbodies, as is the case of the HR director of Whitbread sitting on the UK government\u2019s Low Pay\nCommission. It would be useful to explore, in a larger sample, whether the Insider category might be\nsplit into two: Insiders and Insiders with Public Sector Experience. Directors falling into this second\ncategory should be very attractive to those seeking future outside directors. If there are gender\ndifferences, is it the result of women managing their career portfolios, or are women inside\ndirectors offered more opportunities by government agencies as scarce resources for public\nservice?\nWe acknowledge several limitations of our study. First, we gathered data only from publicly\navailable information. Self-reports of directors\u2019 experience would be more revealing, but are difficult\nto obtain from a complete set of 144 individuals. Hence we opted for public biographies that varied\nin information quality, supplementing our data from other public sources. Second, there is\nresearcher-induced bias from coding structures and decisions. Our categorization of the director\nroles masks large differences in experience, for example, in the business expert category, where\nsome directors have been chairman and\/or chief executives of similar large firms, whilst others have\nsat as non-executive directors in a more advisory role, and sometimes only on one corporate board\nrather than on several boards. Third, our study uses new directors as the base unit of analysis,\nbut one man and five women were appointed to multiple boards, resulting in an over-sampling of\nthose individuals. Fourth, there may be bias due to the random sampling of the male cohort\nstudied; however we did not identify any significant differences between our sample and the rest of\nthe population of new male directors. Fifth, our study is limited to directors and human capital in\nlarge, publicly-traded firms listed on the London Stock Exchange. Finally, in revealing the human\ncapital of these directors, we have not identified the value of the various aspects of that capital to\nthe board.\nConclusion\nDrawing on human capital theory, this paper explores whether the human capital of new\ndirectors differs by gender, in the context of the frequently reported view that women do not have\nthe right kind of skills and experience for directorships of large companies. Evidence from this study\nsuggests otherwise: in general, new women directors have fairly similar and sometimes additional\nhuman capital to their male peers.\nThe contribution of this study is fivefold. First, it examines the human capital of newly appointed\ndirectors, rather than of existing directors with a variety of tenure. Second, it provides empirical\nevidence that human capital theory has credence in explaining why this particular cohort of women\nhas been appointed. We find that new board appointees in the top 100 UK companies from 2001\u2013\n2004 possess a rich diversity of previous experience. Third, we identify that, compared to men\ndirectors, women directors bring a very different international profile to their boards. Fourth, we\nshow that the Hillman et al. (2000, 2002) taxonomy can mask the added value of human\ncapital from women who have experience as business experts both in large for-profit firms and the\npublic sector, and hence we suggest a five category taxonomy to capture this important element.\nFinally, this paper provides a new UK perspective on this issue, important because of the strength\nand privilege of the \u2018old boys culture\u2019 and the current pressures for diversity. Challenging the myth\nthat women do not have the right kinds of experiences is difficult, as such gendered mindsets are\nresistant to change, and are reinforced by the present masculine profile of FTSE 100 directors,\nresulting in gendered selection and assessment processes (Acker, 1990).\nThis study shows that this new cohort of women directors has accumulated human capital fairly\nsimilar to their male peers in terms of education, reputation, board experience and career\nexperience, albeit at a slightly younger age to the men. Importantly, in capturing the return on\ntheir investments by gaining their directorships, these women are then in a position to\ncontribute the benefits of their higher levels of international diversity, public sector, government\nboard and major management consulting firm experience. Hence if this female cohort\u2019s human\ncapital is typical of new directors for the next decade, then increasing the number and proportion\nof women in the boardroom will provide the potential for a more diverse set of human capital\nexperiences to be utilised by top firms.\nA number of avenues are suggested for further research. An investigation into the director\nappointment process could reveal what type of human capital is most likely to result in an invitation\nto board membership. Such information would be useful in preparing senior executives for future\nboard positions. Other directions could include an examination of the legitimizing processes of\naccess to boards. Future researchers might also consider a broader study examining\ndifferences in human capital profiles between new appointees and the existing board, to identify\nmore specifically how the new director\u2019s human capital complements that of the whole board. A\nqualitative study of newly appointed directors could reveal how directors draw on previous experience\nin the various sectors to make a contribution to board performance during the first term of\ndirectorship. In addition, it would be interesting to obtain the views of chairmen and other\nboard members about the relative usefulness of the various human capital resources of\nincoming directors once they have been integrated into the board. A study exploring the links\nbetween diversity (or change in diversity) and performance in different environments would enable\na better understanding of the institutions of corporate governance. As this study provides a\nbaseline with the human capital of the cohort from 2001-4, future studies could monitor changes\nover time with new cohorts of directors. Finally, our results could be replicated in other country\nenvironments.\nOur findings suggest that individuals seeking board positions need to identify what human capital\nresources they require in order to be considered for director appointments, and to manage their\ncareers so as to build an appropriate portfolio of experiences, knowledge and skills. Those who\nmentor aspiring directors can also benefit from these findings. There are also implications for board\nnomination committees and search consultants tasked with identifying appropriate talent for\nnew directorships, recognising the variety of backgrounds that other boards have found attractive.\nIf the Higgs Review recommendations for increased diversity are taken into account, then the\nfact that the women directors in this study have such a wealth of experiences should augur well for\nwomen\u2019s future access to the boardroom.\n1 Tel: +44(0)1234 751122.
