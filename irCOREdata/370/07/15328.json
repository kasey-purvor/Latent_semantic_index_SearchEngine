INTRODUCTION \nThe THz gap (300 GHz to 10 THz) forms the interface between microwaves and the near infrared (see Fig. 1). Until \nrecently it has been relatively unexplored, but considerable advances have now been made in the effective generation and \ndetection of broadband THz signals [1]. The fundamental advantage over existing techniques, such as X-ray analysis, is \nthe ability of THz to penetrate through materials, such as clothing, whilst simultaneously providing detailed \nspectroscopic information. These spectroscopic signatures can be used, for example, to identify concealed explosives [2].  \n \n \nFig. 1.

These \nsystems have many applications in medical imaging, security and biotechnology. In particular, pulsed systems provide \ndepth profile information alongside the spectroscopic data.  \nTHz microscopes are also being developed [4], but are still in their infancy. These have the potential to further enhance \nthe understanding of the fundamental properties of living cells, polymers and semiconductor devices. However, in order \nto fully exploit this technology it is imperative that new types of lenses and filters are developed for THz operation. The \nfundamental aim of the THz microscope is to enable the analysis of materials which are often physically smaller than the \nincident wavelength. The new elements will need to provide a route to sub-wavelength resolution. \n2.  SURFACE PLASMON BASED METAMATERIALS \n \nMetamaterials have specifically engineered properties which may be unavailable in nature, such as a negative refractive \nindex for perfect lenses [5] or specific transmission properties for filters [6]. Furthermore, additional problems such as \nthe high attenuation coefficient of water at THz frequencies have the potential to be addressed through the propagation \nmechanisms of these new materials. This could then lead to a new ability to study samples with a high water content. \nIn 1998, Ebbesen et al [7] reported the enhanced transmission of light through sub-wavelength apertures in an optically \nopaque metallic film. The apertures were arranged in a periodic 2D array. The enhanced transmission, which can be \nseveral orders of magnitude above classical predictions, is frequency specific and therefore well suited to filter type \napplications. Fig. 2 shows a periodic array of holes fabricated using bulk micromachined silicon which is suitable for \nTHz operation. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Bulk micromachined hole array for THz filtering applications. \nSubsequently, numerous papers have been published both experimentally and theoretically on this phenomenon, and it is \nnow widely accepted that the enhanced transmission is caused by surface plasmon effects [8]. \nSurface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are generated for specific frequencies of incident radiation. These can be formed on \nthe incident face, from where they tunnel through the apertures along the surface and can be reemitted as radiation on the \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6323  632316-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 17 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.65.

The periodicity can be achieved \nthrough 2D arrays of apertures or single apertures surrounded by grooves [10]. A route to further enhancement was \nproposed by Baida et al [10]. This uses apertures with a central conductor, forming a coaxial type structure. The coaxial \nstructure itself can only support particular frequencies. For microwave operation, Caglayan et al [11] demonstrated that \nthis can be coupled with SPP based effects through the inclusion of periodic, concentric grooves.  \nIn general it can be shown that the periodicity of apertures or grooves equates approximately to a resonant excitation \nwavelength. Therefore, for optical excitation, nanometre scale processing techniques such as e-beam writing, focused ion \nbeam (FIB) etching or nanoimprint lithography are required. For microwave devices, conventional printed circuit board \n(PCB) millimetre scale techniques can be used. At THz wavelengths, (1 THz = 300\u00b5m) micromachining techniques are \nideally suited.  \nSurface micromachining uses conventional integrated circuit techniques such as thin film deposition, photolithography \nand electroplating to produce three dimensional structures layer\u2013by\u2013layer.  Fig. 3 shows an example of a surface \nmicromachined device. Electroformed copper has been used to form a sub-wavelength slit and is surrounded by periodic \ngrooves. This is a free space example where the incident radiation can pass directly through the slit without substrate \nassociated attenuation and reflections. \n \n \nFig. 3. Surface micromachined slit surrounded by copper with periodic grooves. \n \nHowever, the structure presented in this paper is a coaxial aperture surrounded by periodic concentric grooves (see Fig. \n4). The central electrode of the coax needs to be held in place. This is achieved using copper electroforming on a thin \nSU8 membrane and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first implementation for THz applications.  \n \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6323  632316-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 17 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.65.

Coaxial apertures surrounded by periodic grooves.  \n \nThe transmission characteristics of surface plasmon based structures are highly sensitive to any materials on their output \nface [13]. However, in order to exploit, for example, the hole arrays as sensors then either a large area of the output face \nor many holes need to be filled with the sample under test. The coaxial aperture is interesting because only a single \napplication of a small volume of material is required. The device demonstrated in this work could form the basis for such \na sensor for biological analysis [14].  \n3.  FABRICATION \n \nComplete free space operation of the coaxial structures (as in the previous section) is not possible since the central \nconductor needs to be supported. However, even low loss THz transparent substrates such as quartz and high resistivity \nsilicon introduce additional, unwanted, reflected pulses into the THz time domain signal. As an alternative we have \nchosen the negative epoxy-based resist SU8-10, deposited to a thickness of 20 \u00b5m, as a supporting substrate for the \ncentral conductor. Such a thin substrate minimises the effects of reflections and absorption. \nInitial trials fabricated the structures using SU8 combined with thick gold electroforming on a silicon wafer. The wafer \nwas etched using a XeF2 dry etch. However, due to the high associated costs and commercial considerations this has \nbeen superseded by the copper-based process flow shown in Fig. 5. \nThe silicon substrate acts a mechanical support throughout the processing steps. First, S1813 photoresist is deposited \nonto the wafer, soft baked at 95 \u02daC (2 mins), hard baked at 125 \u02daC for (5 mins) and then coated with 650 \u00c5 of evaporated \ncopper. This is then electroplated with a further 2 \u00b5m of copper in order to ensure stability of the layer throughout \nsubsequent thermal processing. This has the added advantage of providing a relatively thick low resistance seed for the \nelectroplating. The concentric ring structures have been found to be highly susceptible to electroforming current density \nissues such as preferential plating for the outer ring and relatively poor plating in the central rings.  \nAZ4562 resist is spun to a thickness of 20 \u00b5m and copper is electroformed to define the first set of grooves and the \ncentral conductor. The AZ4562 is removed and replaced with 20 \u00b5m thick SU8-10. This process order ensures that the \ncentral conductor is essentially glued to the SU8.  \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6323  632316-4\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 17 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.65.

It is important to ensure that this metal effectively bridges the \nelectroplated metal rings to the SU8. If this does not occur then the next layer of structural copper does not electroplate \nonto the SU8 surfaces and at the final etch back stages these become cleared therefore rendering the device inoperable. \nThis combined with the preferential plating issues presents an important yield issue. \nAZ4562 is used to cover the coaxial gap and the copper is electroformed over the rest of the wafer to a thickness of \n14 \u00b5m. This layer provides the main structural integrity to the device. Finally, the second set of grooves is defined by \nfurther copper electroforming to a thickness of 20 \u00b5m.  \n \n \n \nFig. 5. Fabrication flow for the coaxial apertures surrounded by periodic grooves. \n \nAfter fabrication, the entire Cu\/SU8 membrane can be peeled away from the Si\/S1813 substrate. The remaining Cu\/Cr \nseeds are then wet etched away to reveal bare SU8 at the coaxial gap. A series of completed devices is shown in Fig. 6. \n \n \nFig. 6.

THZ TESTING \nA broadband THz \u2013 TDS (time domain spectroscopy) system is used to measure the relative transmission of the filters. \nThis is shown in Fig. 7. The available bandwidth of the system is approximately 3 THz. The spot size can typically be \nfocused to less than 1 mm diameter. \nThe Ti:sapphire laser produces a 600 mW pulse of 20 fs duration with a repetition rate of 76 MHz. This is separated into \na THz generating and a gating beam with a 70:30 beam splitter. The generating beam is focused onto an LT-GaAs \nphotoconductive strip-line emitter which is dc biased to 250V. Parabolic mirrors are used to focus the THz signal onto \nthe sample.  \nThe gating and the THz beam are focused onto a 1 mm thick ZnTe electrooptic crystal. This, in conjunction with a \nbalanced detector is use to detect the transmitted THz [1]. A delay line on the generation signal allows the electric field \nof the THz pulse to be scanned in the time domain. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is then used to obtain a frequency \nspectrum.  \nFor relative transmission measurements, the sample scan is divided by a free space scan in the frequency domain. This \neffectively deconvolves any reflected signals associated with the measurement setup. In this paper, the samples are \nplaced perpendicularly to the incident THz beam. \n \nOptical delay line\nChopper\nPhotoconductive\nTHz emitter\nDry N2 purge box\nZnTe EOS crystal\n\u03bb\/4 plate\nWollaston prism\nBalanced detection\nSample\nCoherent Mira Seed\n600mW, 76MHz, ~20fs\n \n \nFig. 7.

The coaxial waveguide in \ntheory should support a propagating mode in the region of 1.4 THz. This has a central copper diameter of 120\uf020 \u00b5m in an \naperture with a diameter of 160 \u00b5m. \nFig. 8 shows the relative transmission characteristic for the coaxial aperture both with and without concentric grooves. \nUp to a 12 fold enhancement is observed with the inclusion of the grooves. The peak transmission at the coupled \nresonance is 16%.  \nFurther work is being undertaken to optimise the resonant peak. Agrawal et al have reported that the SPP enhancement \nincreases with deeper grooves [15] on bare aperture structures. The copper process flow can be adapted to allow for this. \nHowever, this is not a trivial change because on the output face it would require the use of thicker SU8 which would \ntherefore increase the substrate associated attenuation. However, as it stands, this result represents the first reported \ndemonstration of a coaxial aperture with concentric periodic grooves functioning in the THz region. \n0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n Coaxial aperture\n Coaxial aperture\n         with periodic grooves\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\nFreq (THz)\n \nFig. 8.

CONCLUSIONS \nA surface micromachined copper electroplated process has been developed which enables the fabrication of coaxial \napertures surrounded by concentric grooves. We have demonstrated that this structure can achieve up to 12 fold \nenhancement when compared to a bare coaxial aperture of the same dimensions. Further work is underway to optimise \nthe performance of the structure which could eventually form the basis of a highly sensitive THz biosensor for microlitre \nbioanalysis. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis project has been funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
