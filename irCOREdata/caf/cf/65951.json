Edgar \n \n \n \nABSTRACT: This article uses a wide variety of examples to argue that the experience of the true dream (ruya) is a \nfundamental, inspirational, and even strategic, part of the contemporary militant jihadist movement in the Middle East \nand elsewhere. Dream narratives are contextualized through a consideration of the historical role of the perceived \nrevelatory power of the night dream in Islam. This article further explores some key aspects of Islamic dream theory \nand interpretation, and offers examples and analysis of the inspirational guidance claimed by many of the best known \nal-Qaeda and Taliban leaders and jihadists.  \n \n \n \nThis article argues that the experience of the true dream (ruya) is a fundamental, inspirational, and even \nstrategic, part of the contemporary militant jihadist movement, in the Middle East and elsewhere, by contextualizing \ndream narrative data through a consideration of the historical role of the perceived revelatory power of the night \ndream in Islam. \nIslam is probably the largest night dream culture in the world today. In Islam, the night dream is thought to offer \na way to metaphysical and divinatory knowledge, to be a practical, alternative, and potentially accessible source of \nimaginative inspiration and guidance, and to offer ethical clarity concerning action in this world. Yet dreams, even \npurportedly true dreams, are notoriously difficult to validate and, sometimes, to interpret. This article explores some \nkey aspects of Islamic dream theory and interpretation, and considers many examples of the inspirational guidance \nclaimed by many of the best known al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders and jihadist activists. I thematically analyze these \ndream narratives. \n \nDREAMS AS  PERCEIVED METAPHYSICAL AND DIVINATORY KNOWLEDGE \n \nIslam was both born in, and gave birth to, spiritual dreamtime. The Prophet Muhammad is said to have received \nruan\n1\n (the plural of ruya) or \u2015true dreams\u2016 from God for six months before the beginning of the revelation of the \nQuran. Bukhari,\n2\n compiler of the best-known hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) reports the \nwords of Muhammad\u2018s wife, Aisha, that the \u2015commencement of the divine inspiration was in the form of good \nrighteous [true] dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day of light.\u2016 Indeed, it is \nsaid that 1\/46\nth\n of the Quran was given to Muhammad in dreams.\n3\n \nSara Sviri sets out the consequences of this for the role of dreaming in medieval Islam: \u2015While prophecy has \nceased, Muhammad being the seal of the Prophets, messages of divine origin can still be communicated through \ndreams, albeit on a smaller scale than prophecy.\u20164 The same point is made in a hadith included in Bukhari: \u2015Nothing \nis left of prophetism except Al-Mubashshirat,\u2016 which the Prophet explained as being \u2015the true good dreams that \nconvey glad tidings.\u20165 In mainstream Islam, then, there is no future revelation to come other than through the \noneiocratic vehicle of true dreams. This gives such dreams a special charisma, power and authority, and means \nthat\u2014for all Muslims, and particularly for those followers of Islam with a mystical facility\u2014the dream is a potential \npathway to the divine. In sleep or in deep contemplation, the mystically attuned have access to the noumenal, not \njust the surreal. \nThe Islamic philosopher Ibn Ishaq al-Kindi (d. ca. 866), in his Epistle on the Nature of Sleep and Dreams,\n6\n \nargues that whilst asleep the psyche is liberated from the senses and the sensible (al-hissiyya), and has direct access \nto \u2015the form-creating faculty\u2016 (al-quwwa al-musawwira). In general, the truth (al-Haq) can only be discerned by the \npure heart once the many veils covering it have been removed by spiritual and religious practice. In dreams, \nhowever, the liberated soul has potential access to the truth as the material world with its many desires is dormant.  \nThree kinds of dreams are recognized, first by the Prophet and then by later dream writers such as Ibn Sirin, the \neighth-century dream interpreter from Basra whose book Dreams and their Interpretation remains the most popular \n 2 \ndream interpretation manual in many Islamic countries today.\n7\n First come true spiritual dreams, ruan inspired by \nGod; second come dreams inspired by the devil; third come \u2015dreams emanating from the nafs or earthly spirit that \ndwells in the dreamer\u2018s body (as this word in Arabic means \u2017running, hot blood\u2018) and is distinct from the soul, and \nwhat this nafs or innermost heart\u2026ardently desires.\u20168 This third kind of dream could be caused by what had been \neaten and by what was desired by the dreamer, so producing \u2015a medley of dreams, muddled, jumbled dreams, mere \nhallucinations, and nightmares.\u20169 \nTrue dreams are most likely to be experienced by the pious and the righteous, those who have already stripped \naway some of the veils of materialism from their hearts. From West Africa to the Philippines, however, the tri-\npartite schematization of dreams explained above is part of the worldview of the majority of Muslims, not just the \nespecially pious. Muhammad Amanullah studied a dozen staff in the religious studies department of a Malaysian \nuniversity: the majority reported true dreams, and fifty percent believed that they had seen the Prophet in a dream.\n10\n \nA recent anthropological study of female adult conversion to Islam in the U.S. confirms the crucial significance of \nnight dreams in the conversion process.\n11\n \nFieldwork in the U.K., Turkey, Northern Cyprus, and Pakistan between 2004 and 2005\n12\n  confirmed this using \nextensive and random\u2014serendipitous\u2014interviewing of people from all walks of life.13 Ask a Muslim about dreams, \nand usually you will be told of a significant dream that has influenced their life through focusing their attention on a \npossibility not previously recognized by their conscious mind. Sufis, followers of the mystical branch of Islam, are \nespecially steeped in the power and extraordinary value of dreaming. Several Sufis in Sheffield, U.K., told me about \ndreams they had had of their shaykh in which they received valuable teachings about their spiritual development or \nabout their core life issues. These Sufis regarded dreams of their shaykh as true dreams.\n14\n A Muslim drycleaner in \nthe U.K. told of his mother, who had dreams in which the Prophet advised her about how to pray.\n15\n A textile seller \nin Peshawar, Pakistan, told how the Prophet had appeared in a dream and shown him the way to slake the continual \nthirst he had experienced in his dream, through praying five times a day.\n16\n Thereafter he had been happy. A fifteen- \nyear-old-boy from Birmingham, U.K., whom I met in a madrasa in Peshawar, told how he had moved to Pakistan to \nstudy to become an imam partly through a dream.\n17\n  \nThe appearance of the Prophet Muhammad in a dream is of particular importance. The hadiths say that if the \nProphet appears in a dream, then it is a true dream.\n18\n Many people I spoke to confirmed this. For non-Muslims, the \nconviction that to dream of the Prophet is to have received a true guidance from God could be seen as opening a \nPandora\u2018s Box of new revelations, but there are safeguards. The Prophet must be complete in his shape,19 and no \ntrue dream can advocate behavior contrary to the teachings of the Quran and the hadiths. An imam in Peshawar gave \ntwo examples of this from his own experience. The first involved a lawyer who went to him for help in interpreting \na dream of the Prophet rolled up in a carpet. The imam responded by saying \u2015you are a corrupt lawyer,\u2016 presumably \nas the body and energy of the Prophet were circumscribed. The second example was of a man who had a dream in \nwhich the Prophet had said he could drink alcohol. The imam asked him if he was a drinker and the man said \u2015yes,\u2016 \nto which the imam replied that it was not the Prophet he had seen, but a self-justification for his drinking alcohol.  \nDream interpretation in Islam, even given the apparently simple classificatory system, is extremely \nsophisticated, and takes into account factors that include the piety and spiritual rank of the dreamer, their social \nposition, the time of night of the dream, and the time of year. Islamic dream dictionaries, unlike their Western \ncounterparts, may contain many interpretations for the same symbol.\n20\n For example, if a poor person dreams of \nhoney, this can be a sign of illness as only then will poor people buy honey, whereas for a rich person to dream of \nhoney is a favorable sign. I was told by religious scholars that only a prophet can definitively distinguish a true from \na false dream; even spiritual leaders such as shaykhs may disagree about interpretations.  \nAnyone, then, may have a true dream, though it is more likely to be experienced by a pious person, or by one \nwho is perhaps going to become more pious on account of the dream. In this sense, Islamic dream theory and \npractice enshrines the possibility of every believer having true dreams, and indeed in Islamic eschatology all \nbelievers will receive true dreams prior to the End Time. \nDreams can facilitate conversions, either into Islam or into militant jihadism. An example of the first type of \nconversion is a Chilean man whom I met in Islamabad, who had previously been a TV shop owner in Chile.\n21\n He \ntold me he became Muslim following a dream in which he saw the first words of the Quran written in the skies. He \nmoved to Pakistan with his family and was studying Islam in a Karachi madrasa. His mother had married a Muslim \npreacher, and his son had trained as a hafiz (one who can recite all the Quran). An example of the second type of \nconversion is the dream of the sister of Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which is said \nto have been one of two reasons why he converted to Jihadism. This dream is discussed below. \n \nTHE PATTERNS AND THREADS RUNNING THROUGH \nJIHADIST DREAM INTERPRETATION \n 3 \n \nCertain patterns inform jihadist dream interpretive narratives. First, jihadists are reported to receive divine \ninspiration, guidance and divinatory news of future events in this world and the world hereafter. Second, dream \nnarratives in part legitimate jihadist actions for the dreamers themselves, for their followers, and for the Islamic \nnation, the umma. Third, dream visions connect the dreamers with the mythically real past of the Prophet \nMuhammad and his companions, the golden age of Islam. In addition, dreams actually introduce this glorious past \ninto the present: the visionary and revelatory world of Islam is reborn today, as dreamers base their inspired jihad \nupon the \u2015glad tidings\u2016 that Muhammad said would come through true dreams. Fourth, there is often a marked \nreliance on the manifest content of the dream symbolism: sacred figures from the visionary history of Islam \n(particularly the Prophet, his companions, and Hasan and Hussein) communicate, usually through the spoken word, \ndirectly to the dreamer as in a revelation, announcing and instructing the dreamer. Dreams of heavenly spaces and \nthe glorious reception of the martyrs are reported; dead friends appear with metaphysical information. \nAs in all dream cultures, jihadists both dream and interpret their dreams within their own culturally-specific \nworldview, in this case that of Islam, according to which this material world is not our final destination, but rather a \nseries of lessons and tests and a preparation for the hereafter and the time of judgment at death. The more real world \nof the hereafter does, however, occasionally intersect with this material world through night dreams, and, more \nrarely, through waking visions. Such hyperlucid experiences can define actions and events in this world. This \ninterrelationship between dreams and events positions dreaming as potentially related to the future rather than to the \npast, as is the case in most Western psychoanalytic theories of dreaming, such as that of Freud.\n22\n In Islam, dreams \nand future events in this world can be clearly related, unlike in the West. The Joseph sura in the Quran makes this \nespecially clear as Joseph, through his interpretation of the seven fat and thin cows dream of the Egyptian pharaoh, \nenables the pharaoh to plan ahead for a succession of bad harvests. Specifically, through the Prophetic example of \nMuhammad, dreams can be related to success in warfare. Muhammad dreams before the battle of Badr that the \nenemy forces are smaller than they actually are, giving him and his army confidence in victory.\n23\n  \n \nTHE DREAMS OF AL-QAEDA MEMBERS \n \nThere are many reports on the power and significance of true dreams of many of the best known jihadist \ncommanders and followers, some of which now follow. These accounts come from secondary sources such as \nwebsites and newspaper articles. However, I gathered the data concerning Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, directly. \nOverall, I suggest that\u2014whatever veracity issues there may be concerning particular individual dream narratives\u2014\nthere are definitely thematic patterns, as outlined above, in these dream narratives and in their legitimacy claims \nwhich are fully consistent with Islamic night dream teachings and practices. \nAll the reported dreams in this paper, often involving a divinatory or precognitive claim, are still reported after \nthe events that the dreams claim to refer to. In the conclusion, I discuss the possibility that all the dream narratives in \nthis paper are fabricated and propagandist in intent, and argue that this is both unlikely and, in one sense, beside the \npoint. \n \nOsama bin Laden \n \nOsama bin Laden, the well-known leader of al-Qaeda, does seem to relate to night dreams. Following the 9\/11 \nattack in New York, many newspapers reported a transcript of a video apparently showing bin Laden referring to the \nanticipatory dreams of some of his followers.\n24\n These followers apparently did not know of the planned attacks, and \nbin Laden speaks of his concern that \u2015the secret [of the attacks] would be revealed if everyone starts seeing it in their \ndreams.\u201625 Early in the video bin Laden says, \n \nAbu\u2018l-Hassan al-Masri told me a year ago: \u2015I saw in a dream, we were playing a soccer game against the Americans. \nWhen our team showed up in the field, they were all pilots!\u2016 He [Al-Masri] didn\u2018t know anything about the operation \nuntil he heard it on the radio. He said the game went on and we defeated them. That was a good omen for us.26  \n \nThe use of the term omen indicates a belief that dreams are a potential source of divination, especially for pious and \nspiritually-oriented Muslims. Moreover, whilst the military contest is disguised as a football match, the victory over \nthe Americans by the jihadist pilots is made manifest in the dream symbolism. Future victory is clearly symbolized. \nYosri Fouda was the Al-Jazeera journalist who in 2002 interviewed in Karachi, Pakistan, two of the Al-Qaeda \nplanners for the 9\/11 attack: Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad. He wrote about the role of \ndreaming for the 9\/11 attackers: \n 4 \n \nDreams and visions and their interpretations are also an integral part of these spiritual beliefs. They mean that the \nMujahideen are close to the Prophet, for whatever the Prophet dreams will come true. In a videotape recorded shortly \nafter 11 September, al-Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith is seen and heard speaking in the company of bin \nLaden, who was playing host to a visitor from Mecca: \u2015I saw in my dreams that I was sitting in a room with the Sheikh \n[Bin Laden], and all of a sudden there was breaking news on TV. It showed an Egyptian family going about its \nbusiness and a rotating strap that said: \u2017In revenge for the sons of Al-Aqsa [that is, the Palestinians], Osama bin Laden \nexecutes strikes against the Americans.\u2018\u2016 That was before the event. \n \nBin Laden then interprets: \u2015The Egyptian family symbolises Muhammad Atta, may Allah have mercy on his soul. He \nwas in charge of the group.\u2016 \n \nRamzi Binalshibh would later tell Fouda long stories about the many dreams and visions of the \u2015brothers\u2016 in the run-up \nto 11 September. He would speak of the Prophet and his close companions as if he had actually met them . . . Atta . . . \nalso told Ramzi a little anecdote about \u2015brother\u2016 Marwan (al-Shehdi) that he knew would please him.27 \u2015Muhammad \n(Atta) told me that Marwan had a beautiful dream that he was [physically] flying high in the sky surrounded by green \nbirds not from our world, and that he was crashing into things, and that he felt so happy.\u2016 \n \n\u2015What things?\u2016 Fouda asked. \n \n\u2015Just things,\u2016 answered Ramzi. \n \nGreen birds are often given significance in these dreams. 28 \n \nWhilst Ramzi is cautious about analyzing this dream, it is likely that the \u2015green birds not from our world\u2016 would be \ninterpreted as a heavenly symbol: green is a spiritual color in Islam, and flying birds are a common symbol of \nheaven. Marwan reporting that he was flying high in a symbolically-constituted heavenly realm and also crashing \ninto things could easily be interpreted as another \u2015good\u2016 omen for the 9\/11 jihadists. Whilst the rotating strap that \nspeaks is surreal, its message is plain: that the basic political cause fueling the jihad is the continual oppression of \nthe Palestinian people by Israel, the U.S. and its allies. Revenge is indeed in the air, and success against the \nAmericans is foretold through the medium of the television, a medium that later presented the 9\/11 attack so \ngraphically. \nBy defining the meaning of the dream in relating the Egyptian family image to the person of Atta, bin Laden is \ntaking on part of the traditional spiritually authoritative role of a shaykh, a spiritual master, as an interpreter of \ndreams. Binalshibh speaks of the Prophet and his companions as if he had actually met them in his visions and \ndreams, thereby showing his apparent familiarity with, and connection to, the early days of Islam. His mindset is \ntuned into an eternally enduring hyper\u2013reality, in which linear temporality is confounded and the glorious Islamist \npast is evoked in an ongoing intimacy and immediacy. The days of revelation are indeed present today.\n29\n \nRobert Fisk, the Middle East correspondent for the Independent, reports that during one of his three meetings \nwith bin Laden, bin Laden said: \u2015Mr Robert\u2026one of our brothers had a dream. He dreamt that you came to us one \nday on a horse, that you had a beard and that you were a spiritual person. You wore a robe like us. This means you \nare a true Moslem.\u2016 This terrifies Fisk, who fears he is meant to \u2015accept this \u2017dream\u2018 as a prophecy and a divine \ninstruction.\u2016 Fisk says \u2015I am not a Moslem, I am a journalist.\u2016 Osama replies, \u2015if you tell the truth, that means you \nare a good Moslem.\u2016 The moment passes. 30 \nOne view of this could be that bin Laden is using the dream trope as a way of challenging Fisk, or as a device to \ninfluence his followers. However, since it is considered wrong to lie about a dream in the Islamic tradition, it is more \nlikely that this provides further evidence that bin Laden considers dreams a potentially divinatory form of \ncommunication. The beard is a sign of a devout Muslim and the horse is traditionally interpreted in Islamic dream \ndictionaries as symbolizing a \u2015person\u2018s status, rank, honor, dignity, power and glory.\u201631 Again, we see bin Laden \nacting as a spiritual master, defining the meaning of this dream, and reframing Fisk\u2018s reply to confirm his, bin \nLaden\u2018s, interpretation of the dream. Bin Laden utilizes his companion\u2018s dream as a source of spiritual certainty in \nthe Prophetic tradition.  \n \n \nZacarias Moussaoui \n \nZacarias Moussaoui has often been described as the twentieth member of the 9\/11 attack team. A French citizen \nof Moroccan origin, he was an al-Qaeda member who attended flight training school before 9\/11. He was tried in \n 5 \n2006 and found guilty of conspiring to kill Americans in the 9\/11 attack. His reported night dream of flying a plane \ninto a tall building was a significant issue in his trial. There was debate as to whether such a dream was evidence of \nschizophrenia, or was an aspect of his fundamentalist Islamic belief.\n32\n Again, the dream is interpreted manifestly and \nas being divinatory. Bin Laden was reported at the trial as having advised him \u2015to follow his dream.\u2016  \n \n \nRichard Reid \n \nRichard Reid is the British al-Qaeda sympathizer sentenced to life imprisonment for attempting to blow up an \nAmerican Airlines airplane flying from France to the U.S. in December 2001. He was found to be carrying \nexplosives in his shoes. He is reported as divining special meaning about his role as an Islamic militant from his \ndreams, which he refers to in one of his final three emails.\n33\n I have been unable to obtain a copy of these emails, but \nthe dream is referred to in Moussaoui\u2018s 2006 trial. According to the transcript: \n \nIn the dream, Reid was waiting for a ride, but when the ride (a pick-up truck) came, it was full and Reid could not go. \nHe was upset and had to go later in a smaller car. Reid explained the meaning of the dream as follows: \u2015I now believe \nthat the pickup that came first was 9\/11 as it\u2018s true that I was upset at not being sent.\u2016 34 \n \nThere is little evidence here of how Reid interpreted this dream. However, this narrative does show his perception of \nits veracity and potential guidance. In Reid\u2018s interpretation there is an interpretive translation from the symbolism of \nthe pickup truck to that of the airplane; both are forms of group conveyance. Being upset in the dream connects his \ndream with his real-world loss of the 9\/11 attack opportunity. \n \n \nAbu Mussab al-Zarqawi and Other Iraqi Martyrs \n \nAbu Mussab al-Zarqawi was the Jordanian leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq until his death in June 2006. He is \nreported on a website by one of his Jordanian jailmates to have converted to radical Islam partly through his sister\u2018s \ndream of a sword with the word \u2015Jihad\u2016 on the one side and the Quranic verse: \u2015God will never abandon you and \nwill never forget you\u2016 on the other side.35 The sacred communication is manifest; divine instructions are perceived \nas having been received. Jihad is authorized and a spiritual promise made. Unfortunately, no more details of his \ndreams are known. \nAnother website carries Islamic martyrs\u2018 biographies.36 The following extracts concerning two Saudi Arabian \nmartyrs (April 2006) refer to dream narratives as significant. The first is that of Abu Bakr al-Qasimi, from the city of \nAl-Haboob in the Qassem region, who was killed in Iraq. This dream refers to the idea that holy warriors will be \nwelcomed and attended in heaven by beautiful maidens: \n \nAbu Bakr would stay up at night for prayer\u2026the martyr, may God have mercy on his soul, saw the beautiful black-\neyed women in paradise [in dreams] more than once [in fact three times], and he became increasingly passionate about \nmeeting blessed God.37 \n \nThe dream imagery is understood as referring to an actual paradisical other world and Abu Bakr is increasingly \ndrawn to this envisioned world and its consummate promise. \nThe second is that of Abu Uthman al-Yamani, from Yemen, who appeared, following his martyrdom in Iraq, in \none of the dreams of Ab\u2018ul-Harith al-Dusari: \n \nOne of Abu Uthman\u2018s brothers saw him in his dream. He dreamt that someone called out to him and told him that Abu \nUthman had managed to secure a place in one of the best gardens of paradise\u2014a dream that I interpret as a sign that he \nindeed became a martyr, though only God knows. One of his brothers from the peninsula of blessed Muhammad [Saudi \nArabia] made him swear that he would appear in his dreams if God allowed him to join the ranks of martyrs. And, \nindeed, this is exactly what happened, and Abu Uthman appeared in his dreams urging him to come and join him in \nparadise. Farewell, Abu Uthman, and may God have mercy upon your soul. 38 \n \nThe interpretation is explicit to the dreamer, a sign to be read just as it is, a message from another more\u2014and \ndifferently\u2014real world. The dream communication beckons the dreamer to follow him to paradise. There is no \nphantasmagoric or surreal incomprehensibility to unravel. The dream is its own interpretation.\n39\n \n \n 6 \nTHE DREAMS OF OTHER JIHADISTS \n \nThe patterns that have been noted above in the cases of members of al-Qaeda are repeated with other jihadists. \n \nMullah Omar \n \nMullah Muhammad Omar led the Taliban movement in Afghanistan and was effectively Afghanistan\u2018s ruler \nfrom 1996 to 2001. After the 9\/11 attacks there were several media and Internet notices of his visionary dreams, \nreferring to his legitimizing the founding of the Taliban by claiming divine guidance and instruction in his dreams.\n40\n \nI was told that it was common knowledge in Afghanistan that Mullah Omar had been inspired by a holy dream.\n41\n \nIn 2005 I interviewed Rahimullah Yusufzai, the BBC correspondent in Peshawar. He was one of very few \nreporters to have met Omar frequently, and was Omar\u2019s main outlet to the Western media.42 According to Yusufzai, \nOmar trusted him because: \n \nThe BBC is very powerful in Afghanistan; they [the Taliban] wanted to have good relations with the BBC and I was \nthe first one to reach Kandahar and report about the emerging Taliban. Mullah Omar was grateful to me; that\u2018s why he \nwill call me up; I spoke the same language Pashto and I was a Muslim, I was a Pakistani, I was someone he could \ntrust.43 \n \nYusufzai described how Omar derived charismatic authority from his reported dreams: \n \nThe story I was being told everywhere was that because of his courage, because of his very timely decision to fight the \nMujahideen that had made him very popular and the Taliban flocked to his banner as they thought he has this vision, \nthis dream, he has challenged the Mujahideen and because he has been instructed to fight the Mujahideen they thought \nhe was going to succeed\u2026The whole project was maybe built on this dream, he had this task or duty to perform and he \nmust lead his Taliban, his fighters, and he must restore order and peace and enforce Sharia, Islamic law\u2026I was told by \nso many Taliban leaders, commanders, fighters: \u2015Look, you know, Mullah Omar is a holy man and he gets instructions \nin his dream and he follows them up.\u2016 The genesis of the Taliban Islamic movement was this vision, this night dream \nthat Mullah Omar had. \n \nOmar\u2018s reputed talent for true dreams was not confined to a single dream. Yusufzai related how such dreams \nbecame a source of strategic military action and decision-making: \u2015I kept hearing these stories, no big military \noperation can happen unless he gets his instructions in his dreams; he was a big believer in dreams.\u2016 \nYusufzai told me that on one occasion Omar had telephoned him and had asked him about a dream that his \n(Omar\u2018s) brother had had: \n \n[He] asked me if I had been to the White House and I said yes; \u2015can you tell me about it?\u2016 and I said, yes, and I told \nhim about the White House in Washington [Mullah Omar already knew that Yusufzai had formally visited the White \nHouse before as part of an invited group of journalists] and Omar said in Pashto \u2015white house, white palace, look my \nyounger brother had a dream and he was telling me that a white palace somewhere is on fire\u2026I have a belief in dreams \nand this is what my dreams are saying and if you have been there then this description by my brother of a white \npalace\/house means it will catch fire\u2016 and this was before 9\/11. I am convinced that Mullah Omar was not aware of \nOsama bin Laden\u2018s plans to attack on 9\/11.  \n \nThese reports contain what are now familiar threads: divinatory communication from sacred figures; followers\u2018 \nbelief in true dreams as indicating holiness; and the relationship between dreams and events as in Omar\u2018s brother\u2018s \n\u2015white house\u2016 dream. Direct guidance as to military action is claimed. Omar is called to implement sharia and the \ntrue Islamic state. \n \nPakistani Relations \n \nDreaming also plays a role in the process of becoming a jihadist in the Pakistani-based movement against the \nIndian occupation of a large part of Kashmir. Before a young man can go on a martyrdom operation in Indian-held \nKashmir, he has to obtain parental permission, which may finally be given following a dream by a mother or \nmaternal uncle:  \n \n 7 \nIn many cases, a few days before the boy \u2015drinks the cup of martyrdom\u2016 [jam-e shahadat nush karna] mothers and \noften maternal uncles see him in Paradise, wearing beautiful white clothes, smiling, surrounded by trees and flowers \nand drinking milk.44 \n \nHere, paradisiacal imagery from the Quran justifies martyrdom. The mythical world of Islam is seen, recognized, \nmade present and manifest. \nSuch dreams are also to be found among radical Muslims in Europe, as in the case of Amir Cheema, a 28-year-\nold Pakistani textile-engineering student who died in 2006 in a German prison while awaiting trial for entering the \noffices of the German newspaper Die Welt with a large knife, intending to kill the editor for reprinting the Danish \ncartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Fifty thousand people later attended his funeral in Pakistan.\n45\n The following \ndream narrative by Cheema\u2018s father was published in the Urdu press and then reprinted in English in the weekly \nFriday Times in Pakistan:  \n \nFountains of light [noor] had burst forth in all directions as the sacred gathering became visible. It was announced that \nthe companions (of the Prophet) had arrived. Then it was declared that the Prophet PBUH himself was seated in the \nvicinity but his face could not be seen. Then the voice of the Prophet PBUH was heard saying Amir Cheema is coming! \n[Amir aa raha hai]. The companions stood up in respect and started looking in one direction. Then the voice of the \nProphet PBUH said: \u2015Hasan and Husain, look who I am sending to you, look after him.\u2016 46 \n \nHasan and Hussein were the sons of Ali and Fatima, and so the grandsons of the Prophet Muhammad. The dream \nannounces the elevated spiritual status of Amir Cheema through the word of the Prophet Muhammad, attended by \nhis companions. We again find the themes of sacred light, and of the clear communication of the spiritually elevated \nstatus of the martyr.  \n \nGuantanamo Bay \n \nMany of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay were from Pakistan. In May 2005 the following dream narrative was \npublished by a Pakistani newspaper: \n \nA Guantanamo ex-prisoner named Qari Badruzzaman Badr said in an interview that at Guantanamo many Arabs had \ndreams in which the Holy Prophet (PBUH) personally gave them news of their freedom and called them the People of \nBadr.47 The Prophet said that Christ will soon arrive. One Arab saw Jesus who took his hand and told him that \nChristians were now misled. Later the other prisoners could smell the sweet smell of Jesus from his hand. His hand was \nrubbed on all the prisoners.48 \n \nAgain, the dream message is explicit. It is Jesus, a major prophet in Islam, who informs them that the Christian \nnation, the Crusaders that imprison them, are misled: what a transcendence of their oppression this dream message \nmust have seemed! It is immediately communicated, not only by word of mouth but also by touch, presumably to \ntransfer the baraka (blessing) from the dream.\n49\n \nNot only the jihadist leaders but also the foot soldiers in Guantanamo see dreams that they interpret as true \nthrough the sacred iconography of their content and the relationship with future events. Jaram al-Harath, a detainee \nfrom the U.K., reported that he was told in a dream that he would be released in two years\u2014which apparently he \nwas.\n50\n Likewise Ibrahim Sen, a Turkish detainee, has written about how inmates experienced dreams of the Prophet \nMuhammad and the angels that watched over them.\n51\n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nFor Islamic militant jihadists, in al-Qaeda or not, dreams and visions are a key way of confirming and \nlegitimating to others their ideological worldview and the path to becoming a shahid, a holy martyr. Whatever the \nveracity of individual dream narratives reported in this article, there is a clear overall pattern of reliance on \ndivinatory dreams for inspiration and guidance within the Islamic dreaming tradition begun by the Prophet \nMuhammad. The true dream experience is consistently utilized as a powerful legitimating device within the context \nof the Islamic theological exegesis of the potential, if very occasional, noumenal power and authority of the night \ndream. The assertions that jihadists are inspired by night dreams and, secondly, legitimate their actions partly on the \nbasis of night dreams constitute the first and second analytic threads of my argument. \nI have previously considered the role of dreams in politics\n52\n and the problematic issues of using and validating \ndreams as data in general in a book on imagination-based research methods.\n53\n While we cannot ever know directly \n 8 \nanother person\u2018s dream,54 we can, as social scientists, study the worldly usage and the politically legitimating \nfunction of dreams: how they inspire and evoke emotion and sometimes apparent novel insight, and how and when \npeople believe them to be true dreams from God. Night dreams can be seen as a technology of the sacred. It might \nbe argued, however, that such dream narratives are cynically adopted by jihadist leaders and some followers for \npropaganda purposes in the knowledge that faithful Muslims believe in the possibility of such divinely-inspired \nnight dreams. Whilst this may be the case in some of my examples, I would contend that the range and number of \nsuch reported dream narratives presented in this article strongly militate against such an argument. Indeed, even if it \nis the case that all my reported jihadist dream narratives are fabricated, the fact that Muslims often believe them and \nare mobilized to jihad partly on their account, as in the example of Mullah Omar\u2018s dream narratives, is of \nsignificance. \nWhile dreams are experienced by the ego, they are not generally generated or controlled by the ego, unless the \ndreamer is an experienced lucid dreamer or a student of Tibetan dream yoga.\n55\n Social scientists can, through studies \nof Islamic dreaming, show how particular dream motifs (such as the Prophet and his companions) are part of a \nshared visionary world which can connect present-day believers with the mythically real past, and especially with \nthe imagined early glorious days of Islam, the time of the Prophet himself. Moreover, such true dreams appear to \nfacilitate the re-enactment of this past in the present. This merging of mythical dream reality and mundane reality \nconstitutes the third thread of my argument, and this is shown, for instance, in the quotation from Fouda concerning \nBinalshibh, who \u2015speaks of the Prophet and his close companions as if he had actually met them.\u2016 The dreamworld \nis experienced as more real than this world, and reality becomes more dreamlike, a veil over the sublime glory of \nhidden paradisiacal worlds. Dreams can be tastes, divinations, of possible welcome futures. Sacred figures are to be \nemulated and even identified with, and certainly their words are perceived as divine instruction. We see bin Laden \nclearly interpreting dreams as a spiritual leader.  \nThe fourth thread of my argument is that militant Jihadism can apparently be directly authorized by dream \ncontent. The classical Freudian distinction between the manifest and latent meanings of a dream is changed. The \nclearer the manifest communication, the closer to God the dreamer is, as we have seen in many of the dream \nnarratives reported in this article. Mullah Omar is given \u2015instructions\u2016 in his dreams as to his military strategy, the \nU.S. \u2015white house\u2016 burns, bin Laden is said to have \u2015executed\u2016 9\/11 to avenge the Palestinians; Moussaoui dreams \nof flying a plane into a tall building; Abu Cheema is welcomed into paradise and the Prophet is heard speaking \nclearly; the words of Jesus are heard by a Guantanamo Bay inmate; another is told he will be released in two years. \nHowever, not all the dream narratives are understood solely through reliance on their obvious meaning. Reid\u2018s \ninterpretation of the full pickup truck passing him by as referring to his missing the 9\/11 attack is an interpretation \nfrom a manifest to a supposed latent meaning, as is bin Laden\u2018s claiming that his soccer team being dressed as pilots \nand winning against the American team is a good omen, or his interpretation of the Egyptian family going about its \nbusiness as a reference to Atta. \nThese narratives clearly show that jihadists understand their dreams within the context of an Islamic worldview. \nDreamt sacred figures, for example, are not unreal projections of the unconscious or deeply encoded manifestations \nof earlier dysfunctional familial experiences, but figures that inhabit the supernaturally real world of Islam, and \nreassert the eternal truths of the Quran and the hadiths. \nThe relationship between dreams and events is another analytic thread running through the narratives. Mullah \nOmar is called to save his country and introduce sharia, and for a while the Taliban did achieve extraordinary \nsuccess, thereby seeming to confirm to his followers his dreamt inspiration.\n56\n A final thread\u2014that of the Prophetic \nexample of Muhammad\u2018s advisory dream before the battle of Badr\u2014is again shown in the dream narratives \nattributed to Mullah Omar, whose followers appear to have believed that he was strategically guided in warfare by \nhis night dreams. Likewise, bin Laden interprets the successful football match by his pilot team against the \nAmericans as a good omen for his jihadist team. \nDreams can then be offered by such charismatic leaders as Mullah Omar as a self-justifying and legitimating \ndevice, claiming them to be revelations from beyond this world and containing authorization for radical human \naction in this world. Reported dreams have, potentially, a special legitimating role precisely because they are \nunverifiable, ontologically derived, and numinous. Burridge confirms the powerful role of night dreams in his study \nof charisma: \n \nAt the start the personal qualities of the prophet seem to matter little. What is important is that his message should \nappear to come from a source beyond commonsense experience. It must be a revelation. Usually the message is \nclaimed, or presumed, to have been revealed in a dream or a vision or some other mystical experience.  Whatever the \ncultural idiom, the message is taken to be beyond man\u2018s wit to devise.  It is a divine revelation. It transcends the \ncapacities of a man acting alone.57 \n 9 \n  \nI have aimed in this article to show through a wide variety of mainly secondary source examples that the \nexperience of the true dream in Islam is a core revelatory narrative that can be understood to inspire, and certainly \nlegitimate, aspects of the contemporary Islamic militant jihadist movement in the Middle East and elsewhere. As \nsuch, perceived, reported and interpreted dreams are a powerful element of charismatic religious and political \nleadership, and such dream narratives still contribute today, as they have throughout history, to the generation of \nexistential, political and militant realities.  \n \nI am particularly grateful to Mariam Abou Zahab for facilitating key contacts in Pakistan and for sending me many \nof the dream narratives quoted in this article; also to Dr. Steve Lyon, Anthropology Department, Durham \nUniversity, U.K., for his facilitating key contacts for me in Turkey and Pakistan, and for his continual and multi-\nfaceted support. \n \nENDNOTES \n \n1 Ruya in Arabic can refer to either day vision or true night dreams from God.
