(Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2009;29:1316-1321.)\nKey Words: gene \u0001 genetics \u0001 LDL-cholesterol \u0001 lipids \u0001 association\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the mostpowerful independent predictor of death from cardiovas-\ncular disease.1 The association between circulating concen-\ntrations of LDL-C and death from coronary artery disease\n(CAD) is continuous across a wide spectrum of cardiovascu-\nlar risk.2 Similarly, there is a linear relationship between\nLDL-C lowering and the attenuation in risk of death from\ncardiovascular disease\u2014 each 1%-reduction in LDL-C\nplasma levels correlates with a 1%-decrease in CAD mortal-\nity.3 LDL-C shows \u000350% heritability4 and correlates with\nfamilial predisposition to CAD even in young apparently\nhealthy subjects.5\u20136 The recent genome-wide association\nscans (GWAs) and the subsequent replication studies have\nidentified several common polymorphic variants with very\nsignificant impact on LDL-C levels.7\u20138 However, the collec-\ntive contribution of the variants identified through GWAs to\nthe overall interindividual variation in LDL-C is modest and\ndoes not fully explain its entire heritability.8 Clearly, addi-\ntional strategies are needed to identify the remaining genetic\ncontributors to human hyperlipidemia. One of the potential\napproaches to uncover these loci is a systematic analysis of\ncommon alleles in genes responsible for rare monogenic\nsyndromes of human cardiovascular disorders. Using this\nconceptual strategy in relation to genes underlying mono-\ngenic forms of hypertension and hypotension, we have\nrecently revealed that common alleles within the locus\nresponsible for type 2 Bartter syndrome (KCNJ1) are asso-\nciated with blood pressure in the general population.9 Low-\ndensity lipoprotein receptor\u2013related protein 6 gene (LRP6)\u2014\nresponsible for monogenic form of CAD10\u2014is an excellent\nmodel locus for investigations on LDL-C. Indeed, rare\nmissense mutation in LRP6 was implicated as the primary\nmolecular driver of LDL-C elevation and subsequent prema-\nture CAD in a pedigree of Asian origin.10 Compared to\nReceived July 25, 2008; revision accepted June 15, 2009.\nFrom the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences (M.T., T.B., W.R., A.H.G., N.J.S.), University of Leicester, UK; the School of Science and\nEngineering (F.J.C.), University of Ballarat, Australia; and the Department of Internal Medicine, Diabetology, and Nephrology (M.G.-K., E.P., W.G.,\nE.Z.-S.) and the First Department of Cardiology (A.S., J.K., Z.K.), Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.\nCorrespondence to Dr Maciej Tomaszewski, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, Clinical Sciences Wing, Glenfield\nHospital, Leicester, LE3 9QP, UK.

All subjects (Polish white) were recruited in 3\nreference centers for cardiovascular diseases in the south of Poland.\nThe recruitment was conducted through probands\u2014index patients\nwith high cardiovascular risk, defined as (1) coexistence of CAD and\nhypertension or (2) one cardiovascular disease (CAD or hyperten-\nsion) accompanied by at least 2 cardiovascular risk factors (smoking,\nwaist circumference \u0003102 cm [men] or \u000388 cm [women], clinically\ndocumented history of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, or lipid-\nlowering medication, parental history of CAD, or hypertension) or\n(3) clustering of at least 3 cardiovascular risk factors.\n213 families (703 subjects) along with 435 biologically unrelated\nindividuals (an independent sample for replication analysis\u2013replica-\ntion panel) were recruited into this study. Each subject underwent\nthorough clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical phenotyping\n(under fasting conditions) according to the previously described\nprotocols and methods.5,13\u201315 Total cholesterol (TC), HDL-choles-\nterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were measured using colorimetric-\nenzymatic methods on a Cobas Bio-Autoanalyzer, as reported\nbefore.5 In eligible subjects (those with triglycerides \u00044.5 mmol\/L)\nLDL-C levels were calculated based on the Friedewald formula.\nGiven that almost 20% of subjects in our pedigrees were on\nlipid-lowering medication, we used categorized LDL-C as the\nprimary phenotype of interest in the family-based association anal-\nyses. We classified subjects as affected if they were on pharmaco-\nlogical lipid-lowering medication or if their fasting LDL-C was \u0001\nthe lower threshold of borderline-high elevation, defined as:\na. For adults (subjects aged \u000319 years)\u20143.37 mmol\/L (as per\nNCEP ATP III Classification)1;\nb. For adolescents\u2014age- and gender-specific LDL-C cut-off\npoints (according to the newly developed clinical classification\nof elevated lipoprotein levels that is linked to the adult NCEP\nATP III values).16\nMoreover, phenotypic information from subjects who were not on\nlipid-lowering treatment was used to examine whether the findings\nfrom the analysis based on the categorized phenotype translate into\nsignificant genetic effects on circulating concentrations of LDL-C\n(continuous trait).\nGeneral clinical characteristics of all recruited SCS subjects are\npresented in Table 1. Further details of phenotyping were in-\ncluded in the supplement material (available online at\nhttp:\/\/atvb.ahajournals.org).\nYoung Men Cardiovascular Association Study (YMCA)\nA demographically and clinically homogenous population of 1157\nyoung (mean age, 19 years), apparently healthy men from the\nYMCA cohort5 was used to quantify effects of LRP6 alleles on\ncirculating concentrations of LDL-C.

All patients were nonsmokers, had normal full\nblood count, C-reactive protein \u000410 mg\/L, and plasma blood\nglucose \u00047.0 mmol\/L.\nThe investigations were approved by the local Bioethical Com-\nmittees and each subject gave a written informed consent to\nparticipate.\nGenotyping\nGenetic Markers\nEleven common (minor allele frequency \u00010.1 in CEU) tagging\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs11609634, rs12313200,\nrs207524, rs7980903, rs11054738, rs2417085, rs10492120,\nrs10743980, rs11054704, rs10845493, rs17302049) within LRP6\nwere selected from the HapMap under the threshold of r2\u00010.8. In\naddition, a common potentially functional nonsynonymous poly-\nmorphism (rs2302685) was added to the array of genotyped SNPs at\nthe preexperimental stage.17 The selected set of tags provides\napproximately 96% genetic coverage for LRP6 locus (captures 96%\nof the ungenotyped common LRP6 alleles in the reference CEU\npanel).18\nDNA Analysis\nDNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes. Genotyping in SCS\nwas conducted using the iPLEX assays on Sequenom MassARRAY\nsystem (Sequenom Inc), according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols.\nAnalysis of genotypes was carried out using Typer software (version\n3.4). Additional genotyping of 2 polymorphisms (rs12313200 and\nrs11054704) that failed on the MassARRAY platform in SCS along\nwith typing of rs10845493 in the YMCA cohort, and Monocyte\nProfiling Study was conducted using commercially available Taq-\nMan assays on ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System\n(Applied Biosystems).\nMonocyte Isolation and RNA Analysis\nBlood was collected into EDTA vacutainer tubes. Within 20 minutes\nof collection monocytes were isolated from whole blood by positive\nselection with CD14 magnetic beads using an AutoMACS system\n(Miltenyi Biotech). Cell purity was confirmed by flow cytometry and\nin all samples \u000390% of the cells were CD14\u0005ve monocytes. RNA\nwas extracted immediately, using Trizol, followed by clean-up using\nRNeasy columns (Qiagen) and DNase. Purified RNA was amplified\nand labeled using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit\n(Applera). Biotinylated cRNA was applied to Illumina-HG 6v3\nwhole-genome expression microarrays, and LRP6 expression was\ndetermined from normalized data from the ILMN 1732912 probe.\nStatistical Analysis\nDeviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was evaluated on the\ndata from biologically unrelated individuals (parental generation in\nSCS families, subjects from the replication panel, the YMCA, and\nMonocyte Profiling Study) using the \u00032 test and the threshold of\nP\u00040.01.13\nGenotypes of the SCS families were tested for Mendelian incon-\nsistencies using family-based association test (FBAT) software\n(http:\/\/www.biostat.harvard.edu\/\u0006fbat\/fbat.htm). Associations be-\ntween LRP6 SNPs and categorized LDL-C (primary hypothesis) as\nwell as other lipid traits (secondary analyses) in families were\nexamined using FBAT19 under null hypothesis of no linkage and no\nassociation. The tests were executed under additive model of\ninheritance13 with an equal-weight offset option that allows for\nextraction of information from both affected and unaffected off-\nspring.20 To correct for multiple testing in single locus family-based\nassociation analysis we used a spectral decomposition of linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) matrices generated for each pair of genotyped\nmarkers as proposed by Nyholt21 and Li.22 In brief, the calculation\nwas based on estimation of the effective number of independent\ngenotyped markers (after dissection of their linkage disequilibria)\nalong with the corresponding threshold of statistical significance\nrequired to keep type I error rate at 5%. In the current analysis, the\nnumber of nonredundant markers and the corrected experiment-wide\nsignificance threshold were estimated at 6 and P\u00010.0085, respec-\ntively. The 6 nonredundant SNPs (rs12313200, rs2075241,\nrs7980903, rs2417085, rs10845493, and rs17302049) identified as\nthe major contributors to \u000390% variance in SCS data (through\ninspection of principal component coefficients for varimax-rotated\nmatrix) were included in haplotype analysis. This multi-marker\ntesting was executed under additive model of inheritance using\nfamily-based haplotype analysis23 combined with multiple (10 000)\npermutations.\nTo provide a quantitative estimate of the effect of LRP6 alleles on\nage-, sex-, and BMI-adjusted LDL-C (as a continuous trait) in SCS\nfamilies, we analyzed data from subjects who were not on lipid-\nlowering medication using additive model of inheritance and within-\nonly option of family-based association test for quantitative traits\n(QFAM available in PLINK).24,25\nAssociations between LRP6 SNP and circulating levels of LDL-C\namong biologically unrelated subjects from SCS replication panel\nand YMCA cohort were assessed by linear regression after adjust-\nment for age, BMI, and sex (where appropriate). The regression\nmodels were fitted in PLINK under additive model of inheritance.\nAdditional exploratory analyses were also conducted under dominant\nand recessive model of inheritance. Beta-coefficients (along with\nstandard errors [SEs]) were used as robust estimates of genetic\neffects.\nInverse variance weighted averages of \u0004-coefficients and SEs\nfrom all populations (SCS families, SCS replication panel, and\nYMCA cohort) were then combined together in fixed effects\nmeta-analysis. A summary effect size and overall probability value\nwere calculated for the combined sample under additive model of\ninheritance using METAL software (http:\/\/www.sph.umich.edu\/csg\/\nabecasis\/metal\/index.html). The between-study heterogeneity was\nevaluated using \u00032 test.\nAll analyses on LDL-C as a quantitative trait were carried out\nusing data from subjects who were not on lipid-lowering treatment.\nBaseline descriptive analysis of other phenotypes across LRP6\ngenotypes was based on Student\u2019s t test, Mann\u2013Whitney test,\nKruskal\u2013Wallis test, Fisher exact test, and \u00032 test for trend dependent\non the type of variable (qualitative or quantitative) and distribution.\nPBAT-based26 calculations showed that for the majority of com-\nmon alleles (0.1 to 0.5) and under additive model of inheritance, the\nfamily-based study had from moderate to good power (0.4 to 1.0) to\ndetect SNP-elevated LDL-C associations of larger magnitude (allelic\nodds ratio range of 1.6 to 1.9) but only modest power (0.1 to 0.4) to\ndetect smaller effect sizes (allelic odds ratio \u00021.3).\nResults\nLDL-C and Genetic Variation Within LRP6 \u2013\nFamily-Based Association Analysis\nNone of the genotyped LRP6 SNPs violated the HWE\n(supplemental Table I). Of 12 LRP6 biallelic polymorphisms,\n1 (rs10845493) was associated with LDL-C (Figure and\nextended description of the Figure legend in supplemental\nmaterial). Specifically, under additive model of inheritance\nthe minor allele of rs10845493 clustered with elevated\nLDL-C in offspring more frequently than expected by chance\n(P\u00010.0053, Figure; supplemental Table I). This association\nretained its statistical significance even after using a threshold\n1318 Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol September 2009\n at University of Leicester (lei) \/ England on May 4, 2010 atvb.ahajournals.orgDownloaded from \nreflecting the correction for multiple testing (P\u00010.0085,\nFigure and extended description of the Figure legend in the\nsupplemental material).\nNone of 15 6-allelic LRP6 haplotypes identified in SCS\nfamilies were associated with LDL-C (supplemental Table\nII). Using a smaller sliding window of 5, 4, 3, and 2\nconsecutive alleles did not have any effect on the results of\nthe haplotype analysis (data not shown).\nGiven that LDL-C is a by-product of TC, HDL-C, and\ntriglycerides, we also examined the associations of these lipid\nfractions with LRP6 SNPs in the secondary analyses. LRP6\nSNPs were not associated with either HDL-C or triglycerides,\nwhereas rs10845493 showed a consistent significant association\nwith TC but of lesser magnitude than LDL-C (data not shown).\nEstimation of rs10845493 Effect on Circulating\nConcentrations of LDL-C in Families \u2013\nFamily-Based Association Tests for Quantitative\nTraits (QFAM)\nThe quantitative analysis restricted to subjects with no history\nof lipid-lowering treatment confirmed the association be-\ntween rs10845493 and age-, sex-, and BMI-adjusted circulat-\ning levels of LDL-C in families\u2014the effect of each extra\nminor allele copy of rs10845493 on age-, sex-, and BMI-\nadjusted LDL-C was estimated at approximately 0.4 mmol\/L\n(SE\u00010.20, P\u00010.0268).\nEstimation of rs10845493 Effect on Circulating\nConcentrations of LDL-C in Unrelated Subjects\nFrom SCS Replication Panel and YMCA Cohort\nAfter exclusion of subjects on lipid-lowering medication and\nthose with missing genotypes\/phenotypes 218 individuals\nfrom the SCS panel and 1138 men from YMCA cohorts were\nincluded in the quantitative analysis. Distribution of\nrs10845493 genotypes was in agreement with Hardy\u2013Wein-\nberg equilibrium in both populations (P\u00010.253 and P\u00010.765,\nrespectively). Minor allele frequency of rs10845493 was\ncalculated at 12.4% and 14.5% in the replication panel and\nthe YMCA, respectively. Mean LDL-C levels stratified on\nrs10845493 genotypes are presented in supplemental Tables\nIII (SCS replication panel) and IV (YMCA cohort). Other\nclinical characteristics of both populations (after stratification\nbased on rs10845493 genotypes) are included in supplemen-\ntal Tables V and VI.\nUnder additive model of inheritance and after adjustment\nfor age, sex, and BMI each minor allele copy of rs10845493\nwas associated with 0.31 mmol\/L increase in LDL-C\n(SE\u00010.15, P\u00010.0476) in SCS replication panel. The associ-\nation between rs10845493 and circulating concentrations of\nLDL-C was also apparent among YMCA individuals\u2014under\nthe same model of inheritance each minor allele copy of\nrs10845493 increased age- and BMI-adjusted LDL-C by\n0.10 mmol\/L (SE\u00010.05, P\u00010.0472).\nSecondary exploratory analyses showed that neither dom-\ninant nor recessive model of inheritance offered a significant\nadvantage over the additive one in examination of association\nbetween rs10845493 and LDL-C in SCS replication and\nYMCA cohort (supplemental Tables VII and VIII).\nrs10845493 and LDL-C in SCS Families, SCS\nReplication Panel, and YMCA Cohort \u2013 Inverse\nVariance Fixed Effects Meta-Analysis\nIn the combined meta-analysis of the data from 1658\ninformative subjects each minor allele copy of rs10845493\nwas associated with 0.14 (0.05) mmol\/L increase in LDL-C\nafter adjustment for age, BMI, and sex (where appropriate)\n(SE\u00010.05, P\u00010.0038, Table 2). There was no evidence of\nheterogeneity in effect sizes across 3 populations included\nin the meta-analysis (P\u00010.1941).\nAnalysis of Correlation Between rs10845493 and\nLRP6 mRNA Expression in Monocytes\nGenotypes of rs10845493 in 161 subjects from Monocyte\nProfiling Study were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium\n(P\u00010.993). There were no significant differences in normal-\nized LRP6 mRNA expression in monocytes between subjects\nwith CC genotype and carriers of T-allele of rs10845493\n(6.298\u00070.184 versus 6.317\u00070.188, respectively; P\u00010.5916).\nCT and TT genotypes of rs10845493 were analyzed together\nFigure.

This association was apparent in 3 indepen-\ndent population samples of subjects irrespective of the type of\nstatistical approach (family-based studies and analysis of\nbiologically unrelated subjects) or the phenotype definition\n(categorised and continuous trait). The direction of the allelic\nassociation was identical in all investigations\u2014the minor\nallele (T) of rs10845493 promoted LDL-C elevation. The\nmagnitude of the genetic effect of rs10845493 on LDL-C (as\nshown in the meta-analysis) is clinically modest but corre-\nsponds well with anticipated contribution of a single allele to\ninterindividual variation in a trait regulated by multiple genes\nand environmental factors.\nThe most significant association signal between LDL-C\nand LRP6 was mapped to rs10845493 in intron 7, only 546\nbase pairs from the exon\u2013intron junction. Our transcriptomic\nanalysis did not lend support to a functional role of\nrs10845493 in regulation of LRP6 expression. Therefore, we\nsuspect that other statistically similar (in LD with\nrs10845493) and possibly yet unidentified functional vari-\nant(s) of LRP6 drive(s) the detected association. In-depth\nsequencing analysis of LRP6 followed by genotyping in large\npopulation samples will be needed to reveal the causative\ngenetic allele. Given that LRP6 functions as a receptor for\ncellular uptake of LDL-C particles,27 reduced clearance and\nsubsequent increase in circulating concentrations of LDL-C\nmay be the most likely functional consequence of the iden-\ntified genetic association. Indeed, LRP6 belongs to a family\nof ubiquitously expressed multifunctional cell surface recep-\ntors28 integrated into signal transmission within Wnt\/\u0004-\ncatenin pathway\u2014a novel regulatory system of lipid and\nglucose metabolism.29 Future experiments based on cellular\nmodels of LDL-C uptake\/internalization are warranted to\nelucidate the precise mechanisms of our findings. However, it\nwould be fair to acknowledge that rs10845493 maps not only\nto LRP6 but also to an overlapping gene BCL2L14\u2014a\nmember of BCL2 protein family that has been shown to\nfacilitate apoptosis and tumorigenesis.30 In contrast to the\ncausal role of LRP6 variants in human monogenic hyperlip-\nidemia10 and LDL-C clearance,27 there is no data (either in\nvitro or in vivo) in support of a contribution of BCL2L14 to\ncholesterol regulation. Thus, the existing level of functional\nevidence strongly favors LRP6 as the more likely driver of\nthe association between the chromosome 12 locus and\nLDL-C.\nWe recognize that our association findings are based only\non subjects recruited in the south of Poland. Replication\nanalysis in samples from other regions will be needed to\nprovide evidence that our association is not population-\nspecific. Larger samples will be necessary in examination\nof genetic interactions between LRP6 and other loci that\nregulate LDL-C metabolism (such as low-density lipopro-\ntein receptor gene) and in detection of more subtle genetic\neffects.\nNevertheless, within highlighted interpretational limita-\ntions, our study shows that common genetic variation within\nLRP6 impacts on the risk of elevated LDL-C. These data also\nimplicate LRP6 as a potential molecular regulator of lipid\nmetabolism and a novel target for pharmacological interven-\ntions. Most importantly, the demonstrated associations indi-\ncate that common alleles in loci responsible for rare mono-\ngenic syndromes may indeed contribute to polygenic forms of\ncardiovascular disease.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are very grateful to physicians, research technicians, nurses, and\nstudents involved in the recruitment of subjects in the Silesian\nCardiovascular Study.\nSources of Funding\nThis study was supported by NIH Fogarty International Research\nCollaboration Award (R03 TW007165; to M.T.).
