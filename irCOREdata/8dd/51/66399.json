In each case we compute\nthe probability that the rapidity gaps, which occur on either side of the produced system,\nsurvive the effects of soft rescattering and QCD bremsstrahlung effects. We calculate both\nthe luminosity for different production mechanisms, and a wide variety of subprocess cross\nsections. The results allow numerical predictions to be readily made for the cross sections\nof all these processes at the LHC and the Tevatron collider. For example, we predict that\nthe cross section for the exclusive double-diffractive production of a 120 GeV Higgs boson\nat the LHC is about 3 fb, and that the QCD background in the bb\u00af decay mode is about 4\ntimes smaller than the Higgs signal if the experimental missing-mass resolution is 1 GeV.\nFor completeness we also discuss production via \u03b3\u03b3 or WW fusion.\n1 Introduction\nDouble-diffractive processes of the type\npp \u2192 X +M + Y, (1)\ncan significantly extend the physics programme at high energy proton colliders. Here M rep-\nresents a system of invariant mass M , and the + signs denote the presence of rapidity gaps\nwhich separate the system M from the products X and Y of proton diffractive dissociation.\nSuch processes allow both novel studies of QCD at very high energies and searches for New\nPhysics. From a theoretical point of view, hadronic processes containing rapidity gaps play\na crucial role in determining the asymptotic behaviour of the cross section at high energies.\nFrom an experimental viewpoint, the presence of rapidity gaps provides a clean environment\nfor the identification of a signal. In such events we produce a colour-singlet state M which is\npractically free from soft secondary particles.\nDouble-diffractive exclusive processes of the type\npp \u2192 p + M + p, (2)\nwhere the protons remain intact, are even better. They allow the reconstruction of the \u201cmissing\u201d\nmass M with good resolution, and so provide an ideal way to search for new resonances and\nthreshold behaviour phenomena. Moreover, in exclusive processes with forward protons, as\nshown in Fig. 1(a), the incoming gg state satisfies special selection rules, namely it has Jz = 0,\nand positive C and P parity. Hence only a subset of resonant states M can be produced,\nin particular 0++ (but not, for example, 1++). Furthermore, the selection rules control the\nthreshold behaviour of the production of a pair of heavy particles. For example, the Born cross\nsection for the production of a fermion-antifermion pair is proportional to \u03b23, where \u03b2 is the\nfermion velocity, while for scalar particles the threshold behaviour is just \u03b2. Thus, for instance,\nin this way we can distinguish between scalar quark, q\u02dc, and gluino, g\u02dc, pair production. Also, the\nselection rules are of crucial importance in suppressing the bb\u00af QCD background when searching\nfor the H \u2192 bb\u00af signal [1, 2].\nWe may write the cross sections for processes (1) and (2) in the factorized form\n\u03c3 = L(M2, y) \u03c3\u02c6(M2), (3)\nwhere \u03c3\u02c6 is the cross section for the hard subprocess which produces the system of mass M ,\nand L is the effective luminosity for production at rapidity y. The luminosity L may refer to\nany colourless t-channel states which transfer energy across the rapidity gaps without radiating\nsecondary particles. For example, the colourless exchange may be a two-gluon \u2018hard Pomeron\u2019\nstate, or a phenomenological \u2018soft\u2019 Pomeron, or even a \u03b3 or W boson.\nThe aim of the present paper is to provide a comprehensive way to estimate the numerical\nsize of the cross sections for all these double-diffractive mechanisms for producing a wide range\n1\nof heavy systems M (for example, Higgs, dijet, tt\u00af and SUSY particles). First, in Section 2\nwe determine the luminosity for the different double-diffractive production mechanisms. We\npresent plots which readily give the luminosity as a function of the massM and rapidity y of the\nheavy system, for pp(p\u00afp) collider energies\n\u221a\ns = 2, 8 and 14 TeV. Then in Section 3 we give the\nformulae for, and numerical estimates of, the hard subprocess cross section \u03c3\u02c6 for the different\nheavy systems M . Armed with this numerical information of L and \u03c3\u02c6, we can immediately\nestimate the observable cross sections \u03c3 of a wide variety of different double-diffractive processes\nat the LHC and the Tevatron, see (3).\nWe consider the following double-diffractive mechanisms. Production of the heavy system\n(a) via the exclusive process pp\u2192 p+M + p, shown in (2),\n(b) via the inclusive process pp\u2192 X +M + Y , shown in (1),\n(c) via the inelastic collision of two Pomerons.\nThe three different mechanisms are shown in Fig. 1. Since we are considering the production\nof a massive system M at high collider energy, the luminosity of the first two mechanisms\nmay be calculated from perturbative QCD, using the known parton distributions of the proton.\nAlthough the cross section \u03c3\u02c6 for the hard subprocess is factored off, recall that there may exist\nspecific selection rules for the different configurations. In particular in the case of exclusive\nproduction only the projection with Jz = 0 and P = +1 contributes to \u03c3\u02c6.\n(a) exclusive\np p\np p\nQ M\nx2\nx1x1\u2032\nx2\u2032\n(b) inclusive\nQ M\nk2\nk1BFKL\nBFKL\n\u2206\u03b72\n\u2206\u03b71\nX\nY\n(c) inelastic I  IP P\np\np\n\u03b4\u03b7\n1- x2\n1- x1\nIP\nIP\nFigure 1: Different mechanisms for the double-diffractive production of a system of mass M in\nhigh energy proton-proton collisions.\nWe need to be careful in interpreting the cross section \u03c3\u02c6 for the subprocess producing the\nmassive system, gg \u2192 M . It corresponds to colour singlet production. That is the subprocess\n2\namplitude is averaged over the colour indices of the incoming gluons\nM = 1\nN2C \u2212 1\n\u2211\na,b\nMab \u03b4ab, (4)\nwhere NC = 3 andMab is the amplitude for the fusion subprocess gagb \u2192M . All other colour\nfactors are included in the luminosity. Moreover, in the case of exclusive double-diffractive\nproduction, the amplitudes (rather than the cross sections) are averaged over the two transverse\npolarisations of the incoming gluons\nM = 1\n2\n\u2211\n\u03b51,\u03b52\nM\u03b51,\u03b52 \u03b4\u03b51\u03b52 . (5)\nAs a consequence, at leading order, we have only Jz = 0 production. On the contrary, for\ninclusive production, the subprocess cross section is averaged over all polarisation states of the\nincoming gluons, as usual. Finally note that for production via soft Pomeron-Pomeron fusion,\nthe cross section \u03c3\u02c6 includes the convolution with the parton distributions of the Pomeron.\n2 Luminosities for double-diffractive processes\nIn this section we collect together the formulae necessary to compute the luminosity functions\nfor the processes shown in Fig. 1. We write the effective1 luminosities, for producing a system\nof mass M and rapidity y, in the form\nM2\n\u2202L(i)\n\u2202y \u2202M2\n= S\u02c62(i) L(i), (6)\nwith i = a, b, c corresponding to the processes shown in Fig. 1. Here we have integrated\nover the transverse momenta of the outgoing protons or outgoing proton dissociated systems,\naccording to whether we are considering exclusive or inclusive double diffractive production.\nAn important ingredient in the calculation of the luminosity is the inclusion of the survival\nprobability of the rapidity gaps to, first, soft rescattering of the interacting protons and, second,\nto QCD radiation. The latter, which results in a Sudakov-like suppression, is included in the\nexpressions for L(i) below. The soft rescattering effects are symbolically denoted by a factor\nS\u02c62 in (6). In practice, we calculate the effects using a two-channel eikonal. As a consequence\n(6) does not have a factorized form, and S\u02c62 should be viewed as the soft survival probability\nappropriately averaged over the channels [3, 4]. The value of the survival factor S\u02c62 depends on\nthe particular double-diffractive production mechanism, and may be a function of y and M2.\n1The Pomeron should be regarded as including all multi-Pomeron effects.\n3\n2.1 Exclusive double-diffractive production\nFor the exclusive process shown in Fig. 1(a) we have, to single log accuracy, [5]\nLexcl =\n(\npi\n(N2C \u2212 1)b\n\u222b\ndQ2t\nQ4t\nfg(x1, x\n\u2032\n1, Q\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2) fg(x2, x\n\u2032\n2, Q\n2\nt , \u00b5\n2)\n)2\n, (7)\nwhere b is the t-slope corresponding to the momentum transfer distributions of the colliding\nprotons\nd2\u03c3\ndt1dt2\n\u221d eb(t1+t2), (8)\nwhere we take2 b = 4 GeV\u22122. The quantities fg(x, x\n\u2032, Q2t , \u00b5\n2) are the generalised (skewed)\nunintegrated gluon densities of the protons. The skewed effect arises because the screening\ngluon (Qt) carries a much smaller momentum fraction x\n\u2032 \u226a x. For small |x \u2212 x\u2032| the skewed\nunintegrated density can be calculated from the conventional integrated gluon g(x,Q2t ) [7].\nHowever the full prescription is rather complicated. For this reason it is often convenient to\nuse the simplified form [5]\nfg(x, x\n\u2032, Q2t , \u00b5\n2) = Rg\n\u2202\n\u2202 lnQ2t\n[\u221a\nT (Qt, \u00b5) xg(x,Q\n2\nt )\n]\n, (9)\nwhich holds to 10\u201320% accuracy. The factor Rg accounts for the single logQ\n2 skewed effect [8].\nIt is found to be about 1.2 at the LHC energy, and 1.4 at the Tevatron energy. The Sudakov\nfactor T (Qt, \u00b5) is the survival probability that a gluon with transverse momentum Qt remains\nuntouched in the evolution up to the hard scale \u00b5 =M\/2\nT (Qt, \u00b5) = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u00b52\nQ2t\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nt )\n2pi\ndk2t\nk2t\n\u222b 1\u2212\u2206\n0\n[\nzPgg(z) +\n\u2211\nq\nPqg(z)\n]\ndz\n)\n, (10)\nwith \u2206 = kt\/(\u00b5 + kt). The square root arises in (9) because the survival probability is only\nrelevant to the hard gluon. It is the presence of this Sudakov factor which makes the integration\nin (7) infrared stable, and perturbative QCD applicable.\nThe luminositiesM2dL\/dydM2 calculated from (7) and (6) for the exclusive double-diffractive\nproduction of a system of invariant mass M and rapidity y are shown by the solid continuous\ncurves, denoted excl, in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the luminosity on\nM at y = 0, and Figs. 3 and 4 show the dependence on y for produced masses of M = 120\nand M = 500 GeV respectively, at various pp (or pp\u00af) collider energies. We use the MRST99\n2If we were to adopt a Regge interpretation, then the \u2018Pomeron\u2019 would be represented in (7) by an uninte-\ngrated gluon distribution fg which, for a large hard scale \u00b5, is described by DGLAP evolution. As a consequence\nof the strong kt ordering, the position of the gluons in impact parameter space is frozen, and hence there is\nno shrinkage of the diffraction cone. This would mean that the corresponding Pomeron trajectory would have\nzero slope, \u03b1\u2032 = 0. Therefore we choose a constant t-slope, b, which characterises the t dependence of the\nPomeron-proton vertex. The value b = 4 GeV\u22122 is taken from the fit to the soft hadronic data of Ref. [3]. This\nvalue is consistent with that observed in J\/\u03c8 diffractive production at HERA [6].\n4\nM2(dLum.\/dydM2)\n\u221as=2 TeV\ny=0\nM (GeV)\nggPP\nsoft PP\n\u03b3\u03b3\nexcl.\nincl. \u2206\u03b7=2\nC-inel. \u03b4\u03b7=4\nincl. \u2206\u03b7=3C-inel. \u03b4\u03b7=2\nM2(dLum.\/dydM2)\n\u221as=8 TeV\ny=0\nM (GeV)\nggPP\nsoft PP\nexcl.\nincl. \u2206\u03b7=2\nC-inel. \u03b4\u03b7=4\nincl. \u2206\u03b7=3\nC-inel. \u03b4\u03b7=2\n\u03b3\u03b3\nM2(dLum. \/dydM2)\n\u221as=14 TeV\ny=0\nM (GeV)\nggPP\nsoft PP\nexcl.\nincl. \u2206\u03b7=2\nC-inel. \u03b4\u03b7=4\nincl. \u2206\u03b7=3\nC-inel. \u03b4\u03b7=2\n\u03b3\u03b3\nFigure 2: The luminosity M2\u2202L\/\u2202y\u2202M2 versus M , for the double-diffractive production of a\nheavy system of massM with rapidity y = 0.

In Figs. 2 and 3 we denote it as ggPP to indicate that the hard gluons, which interact\nto form the system M , originate within overall colourless (hard Pomeron) t-channel exchanges,\nsee Fig. 1(a). This is precisely the quantity which must be multiplied by the cross section \u03c3\u02c6 of\nthe Jz = 0, colour-singlet hard subprocess gg \u2192 M , to form the double-diffractive cross section\n\u03c3 of (3).\nAs can be seen from Fig. 2 the luminosity decreases with increasing M , but grows with the\ncollider energy\n\u221a\ns. The reason is that there is an increasing number of gluons as x becomes\nsmaller, and because for larger M the double-logarithmic Sudakov suppression (10) is stronger\ndue to the higher scale \u00b5 =M\/2.\n2.2 Inclusive double-diffractive production\nExclusive production has by far the cleanest signal. Unfortunately, the luminosity, and hence\nthe predicted event rate, are small. For this reason we consider inclusive double diffractive\nproduction, process (1), with less restrictive kinematics due to the dissociation of the incoming\nprotons, see Fig. 1(b). The cross section can be expressed as exclusive production at the\nparton-parton level\na1a2 \u2192 a1 + M + a2, (11)\n7\nG(x1) x1\nG(x2) x2\nQ\nBFKL\nBFKL\n { \n { \nk2T\nk1T\n\u2206\u03b72\n\u2206\u03b71\nM Q\u2032\nBFKL\nBFKL\nk2T\u2032\nk1T\u2032\nFigure 5: The amplitude of Fig. 1(b) multiplied by its complex conjugate, which gives the cross\nsection for the inclusive double-diffractive production of a system M . The effective parton\ndensities, G(xi) of (19), are to be evaluated at scales k\n2\nit.\nconvoluted with the probabilities to find partons a1, a2 in the incoming protons. The process\nis shown in Fig. 5, where the probabilities are denoted by the effective parton densities G(xi).\nAt the parton-parton level, (11), the unintegrated gluon distributions in partons a1, a2 may be\ncalculated perturbatively in terms of the non-forward BFKL amplitudes A1, A2. This means\nthat we must replace the densities fg in (7) by Ai\n\u221a\nTi, where Ti \u2261 T (kit, \u00b5) is given by (10).\nThe non-forward BFKL amplitudes Ai are of the form [11]\nAi = exp(\u2212ni\/2) \u03a6(Yi), (12)\nwhere ni is the mean number of gluons emitted, with transverse momenta in the range (Qt, kit)\nand rapidities in the interval \u2206\u03b7i\nni =\n3\u03b1S\npi\n\u2206\u03b7i ln\n(\nk2it\nQ2t\n)\n. (13)\nThe remaining factor \u03a6(Yi) accounts for the usual BFKL (single) logarithms. For rapidity gaps\n\u2206\u03b7i < 4 we have\nYi \u2261 3\u03b1S\n2pi\n\u2206\u03b7i <\u223c 0.4, (14)\nand, for Q2t \u226a k2it, it is sufficient to retain only the O(Yi) term, which gives [11]\n\u03a6(Yi) \u2243 1 + Yi Q\n2\nt\nk2it\n\u2243 1.1 \u00b1 0.1. (15)\nWe use this value in our numerical predictions. Note that the BFKL amplitudes, which describe\nelastic parton-parton scattering, already contain the double-logarithmic Sudakov suppression\n8\nwhich reflects the absence of secondary gluon emission with transverse momenta pt up to the\nmomentum transfer kti. The remainder of the hard suppression factor, which accounts for the\nabsence of emission in the interval (kti, \u00b5), has been incorporated separately in terms of the\nsurvival factors Ti.\nThe dominant (leading log) contribution to the inclusive amplitude of Fig. 1(b) comes from\nthe asymmetric configuration Q2t \u226a k2it. Thus the transverse momenta of the two hard active\ngluons can no longer be approximated by kit \u2248 Qt, as they were in the exclusive case in (7)\n[5]. As a consequence each hard gluon propagator, together with its polarization factor, can\nno longer be written as Qt\/Q\n2\nt , but must remain kit\/k\n2\nit. Therefore, the factor 1\/Q\n4\nt in the\namplitude in (7) now becomes 1\/(Q2tk1tk2t). Moreover, in the limit Q\n2\nt \u226a k2it we have kit \u2243 k\u2032it.\nThus, instead of the factor 1\/b, which came from the ti integral limited by the proton form\nfactor as in (7) and (8), we now obtain the logarithmic dk2it\/k\n2\nit integrals. Here we have used\nti = (Q\u2212 ki)2 \u2243 \u2212k2it \u2243 \u2212k\u20322it . (16)\nThus, to compute Fig. 5 we must evaluate\nI =\n\u222b\ndQ2t\nQ2t\ndQ\u20322t\nQ\u20322t\ndk21t\nk21t\ndk22t\nk22t\n(A1A2A\n\u2032\n1A\n\u2032\n2)\n\u221a\nT1T\n\u2032\n1T2T\n\u2032\n2. (17)\nIn this way, we find the luminosity, (6), for the inclusive process of Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 5, in\nwhich the initial protons dissociate and the system M is produced with rapidity gaps \u2206\u03b71 and\n\u2206\u03b72 on either side, is, to leading log accuracy, expressed in the form [10]\nLincl =\n\u222b 1\nxmin\n1\nG(x1)\ndx1\nx1\n\u222b 1\nxmin\n2\nG(x2)\ndx2\nx2\n\u03b14S\npi2\n(\nN2C\nN2C \u2212 1\n)2\nI, (18)\nwith NC = 3. The primed quantities arise because the luminosity is obtained by multiplying\nthe inclusive amplitude by its complex conjugate, as in Fig. 5. The effective parton densities,\nG(xi) = xig(xi, k\n2\nit) +\n16\n81\n\u2211\nq\nxi\n(\nq(xi, k\n2\nit) + q\u00af(xi, k\n2\nit)\n)\n, (19)\nare integrated from\nxmini =\nM\u221a\ns\ney +\nkit\u221a\ns\ne(y+\u2206\u03b7i) (20)\nup to 1. These limits ensure that no recoil jets in the dissociated states X and Y lie within the\nrapidity gap intervals \u2206\u03b71 and \u2206\u03b72 respectively.\nDue to the asymmetric configurations of the t-channel gluons, Qt \u226a kit, we have, besides\n\u2206\u03b7i, a second logarithm ln(k\n2\nit\/Q\n2\nt ) in the BFKL evolution. Using this double log result (that\nis setting \u03a6(Yi) = 1 in (12)), we may simplify expression (17) for I. Then we perform the Q2t\nand Q\u20322t integrations and find\nI = 1\n(Y1 + Y2)2\n\u222b\ndt1\nt1\ndt2\nt2\nexp\n(\n\u2212 3\u03b1S\npi\n\u2206\u03b7\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223ln t1t2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n)\nT\n(\u221a\n|t1|, \u00b5\n)\nT\n(\u221a\n|t2|, \u00b5\n)\n, (21)\n9\nwhere \u2206\u03b7 equals \u2206\u03b71 if |t1| > |t2|, but equals \u2206\u03b72 when |t1| < |t2|.\nThe luminosity M2dL\/dydM2 calculated from (18) and (6) for inclusive double-diffractive\nproduction of a system of mass M and rapidity y is shown in Figs. 2 and 3, by the thin\ncontinuous curves corresponding to two choices of rapidity gaps, namely \u2206\u03b71 = \u2206\u03b72 = 2 and,\n\u2206\u03b71 = \u2206\u03b72 = 3 in Fig. 1(b). Again we use MRST99 partons [9], to calculate (19). Since we\nare working at the partonic level, a Monte Carlo simulation would be required to obtain the\nprecise experimental prediction. Unfortunately, the lower curve for \u2206\u03b7 = 3 is more relevant, as\nafter hadronization the smaller rapidity gaps with \u2206\u03b7 = 2 may be hard to identify.\nThe effective luminosity, that is the number of gg collisions, is larger for inclusive than ex-\nclusive production due to the larger available phase space, since now the transverse momentum\nof the heavy system M is no longer limited by the proton form factor. Moreover partons of\nlarger kti tend to have large momentum fractions xi, see (20). For partons of relatively large xi\nwe sample mainly the smaller size component of the proton wave function, which in turn has\nthe smaller absorption cross section [4]. This leads to a larger \u2018soft\u2019 survival probability S\u02c62. To\nbe precise we use model II of Ref. [4] to calculate S\u02c62. For inclusive production, the survival\nfactor S\u02c62 depends on the values of M2 and \u2206\u03b7, since these alter the values of xi sampled.\n2.3 Production via Pomeron-Pomeron fusion\nThe inclusive process studied in the previous subsection allowed secondary particles in the\nproton fragmentation regions, see Fig. 1(b). An alternative possibility is to detect both elasti-\ncally scattered protons, but to permit secondaries in the central rapidity interval \u03b4\u03b7 containing\nthe heavy system, as schematically sketched in Fig. 1(c). In lowest order perturbative QCD,\nthis process is described by Fig. 6(a), which is similar to Fig. 1(a) for exclusive production.\nThe only difference is that now we have bremsstrahlung associated with the hard subprocess\nggPP \u2192 M . Therefore we can compute the cross section from the same formula (7), except\nthat the Sudakov-like suppression is weaker. Now the 1\u2212\u2206 upper limit in the z integration in\n(10) is specified by\n\u2206 =\n(\nkt\n\u00b5+ kt\n)\ncosh\n(\n\u03b4\u03b7\n2\n)\n. (22)\nClearly the luminosity is larger and increases with \u03b4\u03b7, as is seen from the dashed curves in\nFigs. 2, 3 and 4. We label the curves3 C-inel. to indicate central-inelastic double-diffractive\nproduction of the heavy system, see Fig. 6(a). As can be seen from the figures, we do not gain\nmuch luminosity by allowing extra emission in the central region with \u03b4\u03b7 = 2. If we enlarge \u03b4\u03b7\nup to 4 we enhance the luminosity by an order of magnitude, but at a great price, as will now\nbe discussed.\n3Actually we have included the luminosity of the exclusive process of Fig. 1(a) in the C-inel. results. Strictly\nspeaking, therefore, a more precise notation might have been C-total, to indicate that the \u2018elastic\u2019 contribution\nis included.\n10\n(a) Central-inelastic (b) soft I  IP P\nIP\nIP\n=\n(c) Low-Nussinov\nFigure 6: Double-diffractive production of a heavy system, shown by the bold central arrow,\naccompanied by secondaries in the central region, with forward going protons.\nFirst, it is important to note that for processes of the type of Fig. 1(c), the mass M\ndetermined by detection of the forward protons is no longer equal to the mass of the heavy\nsystem. In this subsection we denote the former mass by MPP and the latter by MH . We see\nthat MPP > MH due to the presence of secondaries in the central region. This clearly applies\nto the process of Fig. 6(a) which we have just discussed, but also to the soft IPIP fusion process\nof Fig. 6(b). For these inelastic IPIP processes we loose all the advantages of the exclusive\nprocess. The clean central environment of the heavy system is now populated by secondaries.\nThe mass MH can therefore no longer be measured by the missing-mass method. Moreover,\nthere is no Jz = 0 selection rule to suppress the QCD background.\nSince the soft Pomeron-Pomeron fusion process of Fig. 6(b) is at present frequently discussed\n[12, 13], we study it in more detail to confirm that it is indeed not a viable search mechanism.\nIn terms of Feynman graphs, Fig. 6(b) corresponds to Fig. 6(c) in which the soft Pomerons have\nbeen replaced by two-gluon exchange, as originally considered by Low [14] and Nussinov [15].\nInterestingly, we see that the cross section for the process in Fig. 6(c) is suppressed by a factor \u03b12S\nin comparison to that of Fig. 6(a). In the cross section for Fig. 6(b) where, following Ref. [16],\nthe Pomerons are treated as real particles with their own parton distributions, the factor is\nreflected in the small values of the effective Pomeron structure functions which are determined\nphenomenologically from diffractive data. It therefore may not be quite so surprising when\nwe show below that the soft Pomeron-Pomeron fusion process of Fig. 6(b) has a smaller cross\nsection than exclusive double-diffractive production of Fig. 1(a). The cross section4 for soft\nPomeron-Pomeron fusion was also recently discussed in Ref. [12].\n4The cross section was also calculated in [13], where a larger value was found, which we cannot reproduce.\n11\nThe luminosity factor for the soft Pomeron-Pomeron fusion process, shown in Fig. 6(b), is\nLsoft =\n(\n\u03c30\n16pi2\n)2 \u222b\ndt1dt2 F\n2\nN(t1) F\n2\nN(t2)\n(\n1\nx1\n)2(\u03b1(t1)\u22121) ( 1\nx2\n)2(\u03b1(t2)\u22121)\n, (23)\nwhere we assume the Donnachie-Landshoff parametrization of the elastic pp amplitude [17]\nApp(s, t) = i\u03c30 F\n2\nN (t) s\n\u03b1(t)\nIm A(s, t = 0) = s \u03c3tot(s) (24)\n\u03b1(t) = 1.08 + 0.25 t\nwith s and t in units of GeV2. FN is the proton form factor and \u03c30 = 21.7 mb. The mass and\nrapidity of the produced system are given by\nM2PP = x1 x2 s, y =\n1\n2\nln\n(\nx1\nx2\n)\n. (25)\nFor this production mechanism the cross section \u03c3\u02c6 in (3), which multiplies the luminosity,\nis the standard inelastic cross section given by the convolution of the parton distributions (of\nthe Pomerons) aIPi with the cross section for the a1a2 \u2192 M hard subprocess\n\u03c3\u02c6 =\n\u2211\na1,a2\n\u222b\ndz1\nz1\n\u222b\ndz2\nz2\nz1a\nIP\n1 (z1) z2a\nIP\n2 (z2) \u03c3(a1a2 \u2192M), (26)\nwith a = g, q. To estimate \u03c3\u02c6 we assume gluon dominance and that zgIP (z) \u2243 0.7 for our\nkinematic domain, which is consistent with the distribution obtained by the H1 collaboration\nfrom the analysis of their diffractive data [18]. Then (26) gives\n\u03c3\u02c6 \u2243 (0.7)2 \u03c3(gg \u2192 M)\n\u222b dz1\nz1\n\u222b dz2\nz2\n(27)\n\u2243 (0.7)2 \u03c3(gg \u2192 M) (\u03b4y)2\/2,\nwhere\n\u03b4y = ln(M2PP\/M\n2\nH). (28)\nHere, to be definite, we have assumed that the heavy system M is a Higgs boson of mass\nMH . Next, it is important to note that \u03c3(gg \u2192 H) for the inelastic subprocess within the soft\nIPIP fusion mechanism of Fig. 6(b) is a factor 1\/2(N2C \u2212 1) smaller than the corresponding\n\u03c3(gg \u2192 H) for the exclusive process of Fig. 1(a). Recall that this factor arises because the\nexclusive process proceeds via the coherent fusion of gluons of different spin and colour, which\nleads to an enhancement of 2(N2C \u2212 1) in comparison with the inclusive process of Fig. 6(b),\nsee (4) and (5).\n12\nIn addition, at Tevatron energies, after observing the leading outgoing proton and antipro-\nton, the available phase space \u03b4y becomes rather small, \u03b4y \u223c 1. In summary, the cross section\n\u03c3\u02c6 multiplying the luminosity in (3) is a factor of about\n(0.7)2\n1\n2(N2C \u2212 1)\n(\u03b4y)2\n2\n\u2243 1\n64\n(29)\nsmaller for production via soft IPIP fusion (Fig. 6(b)) than via the \u2018clean\u2019 exclusive process\nof Fig. 1(a). Now from Fig. 3, we see that, for the production of a Higgs boson of mass\nMH = 120 GeV, the soft IPIP luminosity calculated from (23) is only a factor of about 10\nlarger than the luminosity for exclusive production. In both processes we use the same survival\nfactor5 S\u02c62, which was given at the end of subsection 2.1. Thus we obtain our advertised\nresult: the expected rate of double-diffractive Higgs production at the Tevatron in the \u2018dirty\u2019\nenvironment of inelastic IPIP fusion (Fig. 6(b)) is in fact smaller6 than the rate for production\nby the \u2018clean\u2019 exclusive process of Fig. 1(a).\nOf course, at LHC energies the available phase space \u03b4y is larger. Recall, from (27), \u03c3\u02c6 grows\nas (\u03b4y)2. On the other hand, in going from Tevatron to LHC energies, the ratio of the exclusive\nto soft IPIP luminosities increases by more than an order of magnitude (see Fig. 2), due to the\ngrowth of gluons at small x. We conclude that there is nothing to be gained by studying the\nsoft IPIP fusion mechanism, at least from the point of view of Higgs searches.\n2.4 Production via \u03b3\u03b3 and WW fusion\nFor completeness we give the luminosity factors assuming that the rapidity gaps are due to the\nproduction of the (M, y) system via \u03b3\u03b3 and WW fusion. We have\nL\u03b3\u03b3 =\n(\n\u03b1\npi\n)2 \u222b\nt1, min\ndt1\n(t1 \u2212 t1,min)\nt21\n(F em(t1))\n2\n\u222b\nt2, min\ndt2\n(t2 \u2212 t2,min)\nt22\n(F em(t2))\n2 , (30)\nwhere |ti,min| = x2im2N , mN is the proton mass and \u03b1 = 1\/137. As the dominant (logarithmically\nenhanced) contribution comes from very small |ti|, that is large impact parameters, here we\nwould expect the survival factor S\u02c62 to be close to 1 [5]. Indeed, we find this to be the case,\nas illustrated by the values of S\u02c62 that are given in Section 3.1.3 for Higgs production via \u03b3\u03b3\nfusion. The \u03b3\u03b3 luminosity, (6), shown in Fig. 2 is calculated7 from L\u03b3\u03b3 , and includes the gap\nsurvival factor S\u02c62.\n5Another way to estimate S\u02c62 is to compare the data with the theoretical prediction which does not account\nfor the soft rescattering effects. Special care should be taken if this method is used. If the \u2018bare\u2019 theoretical\ncross section is calculated using, for example, only the mechanism of Fig. 6(b) and does not include the more\nimportant central inelastic production mechanism of Fig. 6(a), then S\u02c62 = data\/theory will be overestimated.\n6This estimate of the soft Pomeron-Pomeron contribution is in reasonable agreement with that of Ref. [12].\n7Besides the proton form factor F em\n1\n, we also include the small contribution from F em\n2\n, when we evaluate\nF em(t) in (30).\n13\nThe effective luminosity for producing the (M, y) system by WW fusion is given by\nLWW =\n[\u222b 1\nxmin\n1\nU(x1)\ndx1\nx1\n\u222b 1\nxmin\n2\nD(x2)\ndx2\nx2\n+\n\u222b 1\nxmin\n1\nD(x1)\ndx1\nx1\n\u222b 1\nxmin\n2\nU(x2)\ndx2\nx2\n]\n(31)\n\u00d7\n(\ng2\n16pi2\n)2 \u222b\ndt1M\n2\nW\n(M2W \u2212 t1)2\ndt2M\n2\nW\n(M2W \u2212 t2)2\n,\nwhere g2 = 8M2WGF\/\n\u221a\n2 and MW is the mass of the W boson. The lower limits of the\nintegrations are given by (20). The effective parton densities, U(xi, k\n2\nit) and D(xi, k\n2\nit) are\nU(x) = xu + xd\u00af + xs\u00af + xc\n(32)\nD(x) = xu\u00af + xd + xs + xc\u00af.\nThe survival factor S\u02c62 is calculated using the two-channel eikonal approach described in Ref. [4].\nWe use the more realistic model II [4], as in Section 2.2.\nPredictions for the WW luminosity are shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 7. Since WW fusion can\nonly mediate inclusive production, the missing mass technique cannot be used. However, here,\nthe enlargement of the rapidity gaps does not reduce the luminosity as much as it did for gg\nfusion. Fig. 7 shows the WW luminosity for \u2206\u03b7 = 2 and \u2206\u03b7 = 3, in comparison with that for\nconventional inelastic production via WW fusion for which \u2206\u03b7 = 0. These results should be\ncompared with the results for gg fusion in Figs. 3 and 4. The upper (dotted) curve shows the\ninelastic luminosity (\u2206\u03b7 = 0) assuming that the gg pair are in a colour singlet state. If this\nluminosity is compared with the inclusive luminosity for the production of a M = 120 GeV\nsystem with rapidity gaps of \u2206\u03b7 = 3 on either side, then we loose a factor of 10\u22123 at LHC\nenergies, while the corresponding ratio for production via WW fusion is only 0.02. Production\nby WW fusion is less suppressed with increasing \u2206\u03b7 for two reasons. First, since theW bosons\noriginate mainly from valence quarks, that is the component of the proton wave function with\nthe smaller absorption cross section, the soft survival probability of the rapidity gaps, S\u02c62, is\nlarger. Secondly, as the W boson is a colourless object, there is no Sudakov suppression due to\nQCD bremsstrahlung.\n3 Cross sections for the hard subprocesses and for double-\ndiffractive production\nSelecting double-diffractive events means essentially that we are working with a gluon-gluon\ncollider8. Indeed, the luminosities presented in Section 2 were given in terms of the numbers\n8For completeness, we also consider production mechanisms where the rapidity gaps are associated with \u03b3\u03b3\nand WW fusion processes.\n14\nM2(dLum.\/dydM2)\n\u221as=2 TeV\ny=0\nM (GeV)\nWW\n\u2206\u03b7=0 (inel.)\n\u2206\u03b7=2\n\u2206\u03b7=3\nM2(dLum.\/dydM2)\n\u221as=8 TeV\ny=0\nM (GeV)\nWW \u2206\u03b7=0 (inel.)\n\u2206\u03b7=2\n\u2206\u03b7=3\nM2(dLum.\/dydM2)\n\u221as =14 TeV\ny=0\nM (GeV)\nWW\n\u2206\u03b7=0 (inel.)\n\u2206\u03b7=2\n\u2206\u03b7=3\nFigure 7: The luminosity M2\u2202L\/\u2202y\u2202M2 versus M for the production of a heavy system at\ny = 0 by WW fusion, with a rapidity gap of size \u2206\u03b7 on either side, at pp or pp\u00af collider energies\nof\n\u221a\ns = 2, 8 and 14 TeV.\nof gg collisions per proton-proton interaction. As emphasized before, there is an important\ndistinction between exclusive and inclusive double-diffractive production of a heavy system M .\nIn exclusive events the forward protons select a colour singlet, Jz = 0 incoming gg state. In\ninclusive events the Jz = 0 selection rule is absent. Therefore, to predict the cross section\n15\n(or event rate at the collider) we have to be careful to ensure that we multiply the relevant\nluminosity by the appropriate ggPP \u2192 M subprocess cross section. Recall that the PP super-\nscript was to indicate that the gluons are mediating a double-diffractive process (loosely called\nPomeron-Pomeron production).\nIn this section we give the subprocess cross sections d\u03c3\u02c6\/d\u2126 which are relevant to the double-\ndiffractive production of various heavy systems M . The differential form is symbolic. For\nexample, for the production of a dijet system, with a rapidity gap on either side, we study\nd\u03c3\u02c6\/dE2T , where ET is the transverse energy of the jets. In this way we can readily predict the\ncross sections for double-diffractive production at various collider energies, using\nM2\nd\u03c3(i)\ndydM2d\u2126\n=\n(\nM2\ndL(i)\ndydM2\n)\nd\u03c3\u02c6(i)(M2)\nd\u2126\n, (33)\nsee (3). The expression in brackets is the luminosity calculated in Section 2, which is to be\nmultiplied by the appropriate subprocess cross section, which we enumerate below. We study\nin turn, resonance production (e.g. Higgs, \u03c7b), dijet production, \u03b3\u03b3 production, tt\u00af production,\nthe production of SUSY particles (e.g. g\u02dcg\u02dc, q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq), and various soft phenomena.\n3.1 Resonance production\nThe subprocess cross section for the double-diffractive production of a 0++ resonance R may\nbe written in terms of its two-gluon partial width\n\u03c3\u02c6excl(ggPP \u2192 R) = 2pi\n2\u0393\u02dc(R\u2192 gg)\nM3R\n\u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2R\n)\n, (34)\n\u03c3\u02c6incl =\n1\n2\n\u03c3\u02c6excl. (35)\nThe extra factor of 1\n2\narises in inclusive double-diffractive production due to the absence of\nthe Jz = 0 selection rule in this case. It reflects the spin coherence of the exclusive process\nwhere the incoming gluon polarisations are correlated, whereas for inclusive production, the\ncross section is averaged over the incoming spins in the usual way, that is\n\u03c3\u02c6excl \u223c |M|2, \u03c3\u02c6incl \u223c |M|2. (36)\n3.1.1 Higgs production\nIn the Born approximation, the width \u0393\u02dc in (34) is just the lowest order R \u2192 gg decay width\n\u03930. For Higgs production we include the NLO correction to \u03c3\u02c6(gg \u2192 H), using\n\u0393\u02dc(H \u2192 gg) = \u03930(H \u2192 gg)\n(\n1 +\n\u03b1S(MH)\npi\n(\npi2 +\n11\n2\n))\n(37)\n\u2243 1.5 \u03930(H \u2192 gg).\n16\nNote that (37) is not the complete NLO correction to the H \u2192 gg partial width, since it does\nnot include the contribution from the emission of QCD radiation, see, for example, [19, 20].\nFor a Higgs boson of mass MH = 120 GeV, we obtain from (34) and (37)\n\u03c3\u02c6excl \u2243 \u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2H\n)\n1.1 pb. (38)\nIn the intermediate mass range of the Higgs, \u03c3\u02c6 depends weakly on MH , as \u03930 \u223c M3H\u03b12S(MH)\nlargely cancels the M\u22123H factor in (34).\nGiven the subprocess cross section (38) and the luminosities of Figs. 2, 3 and 4, we can\nreadily predict the cross section for double-diffractive Higgs production at the LHC and the\nTevatron. To be specific let us take MH = 120 GeV. Then from Fig. 3 we have\ndL\ndy\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\ny=0\n\u2243 0.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 (LHC)\n(39)\n\u2243 0.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 (Tevatron).\nAlso we see that for Higgs production \u2206y \u2243 5 (LHC) or 2 (Tevatron) will allow a quick estimate\nof the y integration. Finally multiplying by \u03c3\u02c6 of (38) (which takes care of the M2 integration),\nwe obtain\n\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+H + p) \u2243 3 fb (LHC)\n(40)\n\u03c3(pp\u00af\u2192 p+H + p\u00af) \u2243 0.2 fb (Tevatron).\nThese predictions are consistent with our previous estimates [5]. The background to this signal\nfor the Higgs boson is discussed in Section 3.2.3.\n3.1.2 \u03c7b production\nAnother interesting example is \u03c7b(0\n++) resonance production, see, for example, [21, 2, 22].\nAgain \u03c3\u02c6 is given by (34), with [23]\n\u0393\u02dc(\u03c7b \u2192 gg) = \u03930(\u03c7b \u2192 gg)\n(\n1 + 9.8\n\u03b1S\npi\n)\n= 550 keV, (41)\nwhere we have used the lattice result \u03930 = 354 keV [24]. This gives\n\u03c3\u02c6excl \u2243 \u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2\u03c7\n)\n3.8 nb. (42)\nAs an example, consider \u03c7b production at the Tevatron. From Fig. 2 we have\ndL\ndy\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\ny=0\n\u2243 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22122, \u2206y \u2243 2, (43)\nwhich combined with (42) gives\n\u03c3(pp\u00af\u2192 p+ \u03c7b + p\u00af) \u2243 120 pb, (44)\nconsistent with the predictions of Ref. [2].\n17\n3.1.3 Higgs production via \u03b3\u03b3 and WW fusion\nFor completeness we estimate Higgs production by \u03b3\u03b3 and WW fusion. For \u03b3\u03b3 fusion, (34) is\nreplaced by\n\u03c3\u02c6(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H) = 8pi\n2\u0393\u02dc(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\nM3H\n\u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2H\n)\n. (45)\nThe factor of 8, in place of 2, arises because for coloured gluons there was an extra factor\nof (N2C \u2212 1)\u22121 due to colour averaging and the absence of the Jz = 0 selection rule. For\nMH = 120 GeV we have \u0393\u02dc(H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) \u2243 7.9 keV, and so\n\u03c3\u02c6(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H) \u2243 \u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2H\n)\n0.1 pb. (46)\nThe \u03b3\u03b3 luminosity, integrated over y, is 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 at the Tevatron and LHC\nrespectively, which leads to the cross sections\n\u03c3(pp\u00af\u2192 p+H + p\u00af)\u03b3\u03b3 \u2243 0.01 fb (Tevatron)\n(47)\n\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+H + p)\u03b3\u03b3 \u2243 0.1 fb (LHC).\nRecall that the \u03b3\u03b3 luminosity includes the gap survival factor S\u02c62, which we calculate to be\n0.75 and 0.9 at Tevatron and LHC energies respectively for the production of a Higgs of mass\nMH = 120 GeV. The cross sections (47) of the present, more detailed, calculation are lower than\nprevious results which were derived in the leading log approximation with S\u02c62 = 1 [25, 5, 26].\nNote that the strong and electromagnetic contributions to exclusive Higgs production (with\nrapidity gaps) have negligible interference, because they occur at quite different values of the\nimpact parameter. Also, it is worth mentioning that the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 H fusion mechanism provides a\nnatural lower limit for the Higgs exclusive production rate.\nFor Higgs production via WW fusion\n\u03c3\u02c6incl(WW \u2192 H) = pig\n2M2W\nM4H\n\u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2H\n)\n(48)\n\u2243 \u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2H\n)\n16 nb\nfor MH = 120 GeV. The coupling g\n2 = 8M2WGF\/\n\u221a\n2.\nOf course, WW fusion only mediates inclusive Higgs production. Note that there is almost\nno interference between the WW and ggPP fusion mechanisms. Recall that the former process\nproduces Higgs with high transverse momentum, and as such may give a viable signal [27, 28,\n29]. Moreover, if we select events with rapidity gaps we suppress the QCD bb\u00af background, while\npaying less price for the gaps in WW fusion as compared to those in gg fusion (as discussed at\nthe end of Section 2.4).\n18\n3.2 Dijet production\nThe Born cross sections, for colour-singlet production of a dijet system of mass M , are (see, for\nexample, [30, 31, 32, 10])\nd\u03c3\u02c6excl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 gg) = 9\n4\npi\u03b12S\nE4T\n, (49)\nd\u03c3\u02c6excl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 qq\u00af) = pi\u03b1\n2\nS\n6E4T\nm2q\nM2\n\u03b22, (50)\nd\u03c3\u02c6incl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 gg) = 9\n2\npi\u03b12S\nE4T\n(\n1 \u2212 E\n2\nT\nM2\n)2\n, (51)\nd\u03c3\u02c6incl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 qq\u00af) = pi\u03b1\n2\nS\nE2TM\n2\n1\n6\n[(\n1 \u2212 2E\n2\nT\nM2\n)(\n1 \u2212 2m\n2\nq\nE2T\n)\n+\nm2q\nE2T\n(1 + \u03b22)\n]\n, (52)\nwhere ET is the transverse energy of the jets and \u03b2 =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 4m2q\/M2. We choose the scale of \u03b1S\nto be M\/2 to be consistent with the convention we have used for the luminosities in Section 2.\nForM2 \u226b E2T we see, that contrary to 0++ resonance production (35), gg production is a factor\n2 larger in the inclusive as compared to the exclusive process. This is the result of averaging\nover the polarisations of the incoming gluons, (5). Moreover we see that the Born cross section\n(50) for exclusive ggPP \u2192 qq\u00af production vanishes as mq \u2192 0 [32, 33], which is a consequence\nof the Jz = 0 selection rule for the gluon polarizations [2, 10].\nRather than working in terms of the subprocess variables M2 and t, it is often convenient\nto use E2T and \u03b4\u03b7j, where \u03b4\u03b7j = \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 is the difference in rapidities of the two outgoing jets.\nIt turns out that factors in the Jacobian cancel, so that we obtain the relatively simple relation\n[10]\nd\u03c3\u02c6\ndt\n\/\ndM2\nM2\n=\nd\u03c3\u02c6\ndE2T\n\/\nd(\u03b4\u03b7j). (53)\nThus the product of the luminosity (shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4) and d\u03c3\u02c6\/dt, will give an evaluation\nof the differential cross section d\u03c3\/dyd(\u03b4\u03b7j)dE\n2\nT .\nThe large cross section for exclusive dijet production provides the first opportunity of ex-\nperiment to check the double-diffractive predictions, already at the Tevatron. For example, let\nus calculate the event rate for jets in the domain defined by the intervals 25 < ET < 35 GeV\nand \u03b4\u03b7j < 2. If we integrate (49) over these intervals, and multiply by the luminosity \u2202L\/\u2202y \u2243\n3\u00d7 10\u22124 appropriate to M = 2ET cosh(\u03b4\u03b7j\/2) \u2243 70 GeV, then we obtain\n\u2206\u03c3(pp\u00af\u2192 p+ jj + p\u00af) \u2243 60 pb (54)\ncorresponding to jets with 25 < ET < 35 GeV and |\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72| < 2, which is in qualitative\nagreement with previous results [10, 5]. Thus even for a Tevatron luminosity of 1 fb\u22121, we\nestimate there should be 60,000 exclusive events in this particular domain.\n19\n3.2.1 Dijets as a luminosity monitor\nThere are, of course, uncertainties in our estimates of the cross sections for double-diffractive\nprocesses. First, the calculation of the soft survival factor S\u02c62 is based on a simplified two-\nchannel eikonal model [3, 4]. With the presently available soft diffractive data, these estimates\nof S\u02c62 are as good as possible, but it is hard to guarantee the precision of predictions which rely\non soft physics. Secondly recall, from Section 2, that the luminosity was calculated in terms\nof the unintegrated, skewed gluon distribution fg, and that L \u221d f 4g . Thus a 20% uncertainty\nin fg results in a factor of 2 uncertainty in the luminosity. We calculated fg in terms of the\nconventional gluon distribution obtained from the results of a global parton analysis of deep\ninelastic and related hard scattering data [9]. However the prescription is only justified at\nleading order and for small x [8, 7]. In the present paper we use an improved formula for fg [7],\nand as a result the double-diffractive luminosity at Tevatron energies become a factor of two\nlarger than in Ref. [5]9. However the same luminosity determines the cross sections for different\ndouble-diffractive processes. Thus dijet production, where the cross section is largest, offers an\nexcellent way to monitor the ggPP luminosity [5].\n3.2.2 Dijets as a gluon factory\nAnother application of the large rate of exclusive dijet production is as a gluon factory. The\nremarkable purity of the colour-singlet, Jz = 0, di-gluon system provides a unique environment\nto study high energy gluon jets [2].\n3.2.3 Dijets as a background to the Higgs signal\nThe large dijet production rate may produce a huge background to the Higgs H \u2192 bb\u00af signal.\nRecall that the cross section for exclusive double-diffractive Higgs production was calculated in\nSection 3.1.1.\nIn fact, for any 0++ resonance the ratio of the exclusive R\u2192 gg signal to the gg background\nis\nSgg\nBgg\n=\n4pi\n9(9.7) \u03b12S \u2206M\n\u0393\n(\nR\u2192 ggJz=0\n)\n, (55)\nwhere \u2206M is the experimental missing-mass resolution, the scale of \u03b1S is M\/2 and the factor\n9.7 comes from imposing a cut 60\u25e6 < \u03b8\u2217 < 120\u25e6 in order to improve the signal-to-background\nratio. \u03b8\u2217 is the decay angle in the dijet rest frame. Note that the major part of NLO effects\nand uncertainties in the luminosity cancel in ratio (55).\n9The unintegrated skewed gluon distribution fg(x, x\n\u2032, Q2t , \u00b5\n2) has been tested, both by providing a successful\ndescription of the data on diffractive vector meson production at HERA [34] and by agreement with the upper\nbound on diffractive dijet production at the Tevatron [35, 1]. However in both cases a much lower scale is\nprobed and we did not need precision better than 20\u201330%.\n20\nFor H \u2192 bb\u00af, the signal-to-QCD background ratio is\nS(ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af)\nB(ggPP \u2192 gg) \u2243 4.3\u00d7 10\n\u22123 Br(H \u2192 bb\u00af)\n(\nM\n100 GeV\n)3 (250 MeV\n\u2206M\n)\n, (56)\nwhich is very small [2]. Fortunately, if we tag the b and b\u00af jets to reject the gg events, we can\nstrongly suppress the QCD background. Recall that the ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af QCD background process\nis suppressed by colour and spin factors, and by the Jz = 0 selection rule. In this way the\nbackground is suppressed by an extra factor\nm2b\nM2H\n1\n4\n1\n27\n<\u223c 2\u00d7 10\u22125. (57)\nHowever the full suppression is only true in the Born approximation. Recall that large angle\ngluon radiation in the final state violates the Jz = 0 selection rule [36], so in the bb\u00af QCD\nbackground the suppression factor m2b\/M\n2\nH is replaced by \u03b1S\/pi. The final result for the H \u2192 bb\u00af\nsignal-to-background ratio is therefore\nS(ggPP \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u00af)\nB(ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af)\n>\u223c 15\n(\n250 MeV\n\u2206M\n)\n, (58)\nfor a Higgs boson of mass MH = 120 GeV.\n3.3 Double-diffractive \u03b3\u03b3 production\nAt first sight, the subprocess ggPP \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 appears attractive to serve as an alternative ggPP\nluminosity monitor for the exclusive double-diffractive processes10. However it turns out that\nthe event rate is too small. Using the known results11 for the QED \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 helicity amplitudes\n[37], we calculate the Jz = 0, parity P = +1 subprocess cross section to be\n\u03c3\u02c6(30\u25e6 < \u03b8\u2217\u03b3 < 150\n\u25e6) \u2243 0.3(0.04) pb (59)\nfor M\u03b3\u03b3 \u223c 50(120) GeV. When multiplied by the luminosity at the Tevatron of 1.8\u00d7 10\u22123(2\u00d7\n10\u22124), we obtain, assuming\n\u222b\ndM2\/M2 \u2243 1,\n\u03c3(pp\u00af\u2192 p+ \u03b3\u03b3 + p\u00af) \u2243 0.5 fb (0.008 fb). (60)\nOn the other hand, for the LHC for M\u03b3\u03b3 \u2243 120 GeV we expect\n\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+ \u03b3\u03b3 + p) \u2243 0.12 fb. (61)\nNote that for M\u03b3\u03b3 \u2243 120 GeV the observable rate of Standard Model exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 events is\nexpected to be much less than even Higgs \u2192 bb\u00af signal. In comparison to exclusive ggPP \u2192 gg\nsubprocess, the ggPP \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 rate is smaller by a factor of 106 for ETg \u2243 ET\u03b3 .\n10We are grateful to Mike Albrow and Beate Heinemann for discussions on this proposal.\n11We thank Andrei Shuvaev for checking various formulae for \u03b3\u03b3 production.\n21\nThis obvious disadvantage of the Standard Model exclusive diphoton production can be\nturned into an attractive advantage for searches at hadronic colliders of signs of the existence\nof extra dimensions, which for instance appear in theories of low-scale gravity [38]. The small\nbackground rate, induced by the conventional box diagram contribution, may allow a very\nsensitive high-mass diphoton probe of the effective scale of quantum gravity effects, MS (see,\nfor example, [39, 40]). To illustrate the level of the possible signal we follow the estimates of\nRef. [39] with effective scale MS = 1.5 TeV. At M\u03b3\u03b3 \u223c 500 GeV one then would expect, for\n30\u25e6 < \u03b8\u2217\u03b3 < 150\n\u25e6,\n\u03c3\u02c6inclextra dim. \u223c F 2\n(\u222b dM2\nM2\n)\n50 fb, (62)\nwhere the factor F is given by (see, for example, [39])\nF = 2\/(n\u2212 2) for n > 2, (63)\nwhere n is the number of extra (compactified) dimensions. We consider here the inclusive\nconfiguration of Fig. 1(b), since for exclusive LO kinematics there is no Jz = 0 point-like\ngluon-gluon coupling to a 2+ \u201cgraviton\u201d.\nTaking\n\u222b\ndM2\/M2 \u223c 1, after multiplying by the double-diffractive inclusive luminosity of\n2\u00d7 10\u22123 (for \u2206\u03b7 = 3), we would expect at the LHC\n\u2206\u03c3extra dim.(pp\u2192 X + \u03b3\u03b3 + Y ) \u223c 0.1F 2 fb, (64)\nwhich, assuming that F 2 is of order 1, should yield about 10 events, for an integrated luminosity\nof L = 100 fb\u22121. It is quite possible that future Tevatron results may increase the existing lower\nlimit on MS, and hence make a diphoton signature for extra dimensions invisible.\nOf course, in the inclusive configuration, there may be some additional background induced\nby \u03b3\u03b3 emission off the quark lines in the process where the rapidity gaps are created by colourless\nqq\u00af t-channel exchange. However for gaps with \u2206\u03b7 = 3, a preliminary estimate12 shows that\nthis quark contribution does not exceed the background contribution coming from the gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\nbox diagram. Thus the total background should not be greater than about 5\u201310%.\n3.4 tt\u00af production\nThe exclusive double-diffractive production of tt\u00af pairs may provide new opportunities for study-\ning top quark physics. In particular, it offers a novel probe of the QCD dynamics in the tt\u00af\nsystem. The Born cross section is given by (50). Due to parity conservation, the tt\u00af pair is\nproduced in a P -wave state, and so the threshold behaviour goes as \u03b23, where \u03b2 is the quark\nvelocity in the tt\u00af rest frame. Of course, the Born cross section is modified by Coulomb and\ntop-quark width effects [41, 42], but for illustration it is sufficient to neglect these, see our\nestimates at the end of subsection 3.5.2.\nNote that the observation of tt\u00af exclusive production can be used as a template of the ability\nof the missing mass method to find signals of New Physics.\n12We plan to study qq\u00af exchange in more detail in the future.\n22\n3.5 SUSY particle production\nDouble-diffractive exclusive processes, in principle, provide a unique opportunity to investigate\nthe whole of the strong interaction sector of physics beyond the Standard Model. As an example,\nwe consider supersymmetry, which is a front-runner in searches for New Physics. Here we ignore\nthe current theoretical SUSY prejudices and assume for illustration, first, that the gluino is the\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The second scenario that we consider is that unstable\ngluinos and squarks exist with masses close to the current experimental limits. Note that it\nis difficult to separate gluinos and squarks produced in standard inelastic hadronic collisions.\nMoreover, gluino studies appear especially promising in gg collisions since these cannot be easily\nachieved at linear e+e\u2212 colliders.\n3.5.1 Gluinoball production\nIn recent publications [43] an interesting possibility is discussed that a gluino g\u02dc is the LSP (or\nnext-to-LSP) or, to be specific, that it does not decay within the detector. The allowed mass\nwindow is claimed to be 25\u201335 GeV. Within such a scenario there should exist a spectrum\nof g\u02dcg\u02dc bound states (gluinoballs or gluinonia), which may reveal themselves in gluon-gluon\ncollisions. The orbital angular momentum L must be odd in such ggPP collisions, due to parity\nconservation. Therefore the lowest lying colourless bound states is the 0++(3P0) state, which we\ndenote G\u02dc, with principal quantum number n = 2. Relative to the 2mg\u02dc threshold, the energies\nof such P -wave g\u02dcg\u02dc bound states are\nEn = \u2212 9\n4\nmg\u02dc\n\u03b12S\nn2\n(65)\nwith n \u2265 2, where \u03b1S is to be evaluated at the Coulombic scale kG = 3\u03b1Smg\u02dc\/2 (see, for\nexample, [44, 45]). We may estimate the partial width of the G\u02dc\u2192 gg decay using the Coulombic\napproximation. The old results of the two-photon decay of P -wave positronium [46] may be\napplied (see, for example, [44, 45]), which gives\n\u0393(G\u02dc\u2192 gg) = 6.4 \u03b12S(mg\u02dc) \u03b15S(kG)MG\u02dc\n(66)\n\u2243\n[\nMG\u02dc\n60 GeV\n]\n0.2 MeV,\nwhere MG\u02dc \u2248 2mg\u02dc. Then, on using (34), we obtain\n\u03c3\u02c6excl(ggPP \u2192 G\u02dc) = \u03b4\n(\n1 \u2212 M\n2\nM2\nG\u02dc\n)\n18 pb. (67)\nThe anticipated cross section for the signal is quite sizeable. For example, for MG\u02dc = 60 GeV,\n\u03c3(pp\u2192 p + G\u02dc+ p) \u2243 0.4 pb (LHC),\n(68)\n\u03c3(pp\u00af\u2192 p + G\u02dc+ p\u00af) \u2243 20 fb (Tevatron).\n23\nHowever the signal-to-background ratio is\nS(ggPP \u2192 G\u02dc\u2192 gg)\nB(ggPP \u2192 gg) = 0.6\u00d7 10\n\u22122\n(\n250 MeV\n\u2206M\n)(\nMG\u02dc\n60 GeV\n)\n, (69)\nwhich makes detection difficult, even with angular cuts. Some words of caution are in order\nhere. Our estimates are based simply on the lowest-order Coulombic formula, (66). More\nrefined calculations of \u0393(G\u02dc \u2192 gg) are certainly needed. Secondly, we have neglected the\npossible interference between the signal and the background.\nThe threshold production of (quasi) stable gluino pairs may be strongly affected by QCD\nfinal-state interactions, in analogy to the celebrated Coulomb threshold phenomena in QED\n[47]. As follows from the results of Refs. [42, 45], in the zero-width approximation the P -wave\nthreshold cross section, d\u03c3P (g\u02dcg\u02dc;M), is\nd\u03c3P (g\u02dcg\u02dc;M) = d\u03c3\n(0)\nP (g\u02dcg\u02dc;M) |\u03c8g\u02dc(0)|2\n(\n1 +\nZ2g\n4pi2\n)\n, (70)\nwhere d\u03c3\n(0)\nP (g\u02dcg\u02dc,M) denotes the Born cross section at cm energyM \u2265 2mg\u02dc. \u03c8g\u02dc(0) is the Coulom-\nbic wave function of a colour-singlet g\u02dcg\u02dc S-wave state evaluated at the origin (c.f. Refs. [47, 48]).\n|\u03c8g\u02dc(0)|2 = Zg\n1\u2212 exp(\u2212Zg) (71)\nwith\nZg =\n3pi\u03b1S(pC)\n\u03b2g\u02dc\n, (72)\nwhere \u03b2g\u02dc =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 4m2g\u02dc\/M2 is the velocity of the g\u02dc. It looks natural to choose the scale of \u03b1S\nin (72) to be pC = max\n{\n(mg\u02dc(M \u2212 2mg\u02dc))1\/2 , (mg\u02dc\u2206M)1\/2\n}\n.\nSince Zg >\u223c 1, QCD Coulombic effects drastically modify the g\u02dcg\u02dc excitation curve, strongly\nenhancing the production rate at or near threshold. According to (70), for Z2g < 4pi\n2 the\nthreshold cross section rises with increasing \u03b2g\u02dc approximately as \u03b2\n2\ng\u02dc , rather than \u03b2\n3\ng\u02dc as one\nwould expect from the Born result. Moreover, for Z2g \u226b 4pi2, the colour Coulombic exchanges\nin the final state completely compensate the kinematical \u03b23g\u02dc threshold factor contained in the\nBorn cross section [42, 45]\n\u03b23g\u02dc\nd\u03c3P (g\u02dcg\u02dc;M)\nd\u03c3\n(0)\nP (g\u02dcg\u02dc;M)\n\u2192 27pi\n4\n\u03b13S(pC) \u2243 0.14, (73)\nfor pC \u2243 8 GeV which corresponds to \u2206M \u2243 1 GeV. This is a dramatic effect relative to the\nlowest-order expectation. The (LSP) gluino-pair production process would lead to distinctive\nsignatures in hadronic collisions, in particular to events with jets accompanied by missing pT ,\nsee, for details, Ref. [43, 49].\nDespite all the attractive features of the gluino-LSP scenario [43], it is possible that direct\nexperimental studies at the Tevatron will close this window.\n24\n3.5.2 Gluino and squark production\nA more plausible scenario is to search for massive unstable gluinos g\u02dc or squarks q\u02dc, which will\nreveal themselves as multijet final states with missing energy and\/or leptons13. As noted above\nthe advantage of exclusive double-diffractive studies is that gluinos and squarks can be separated\nby their respective \u03b23 and \u03b2 threshold behaviour. The Born subprocess cross sections are\nd\u03c3\u02c6excl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 g\u02dcg\u02dc) = 27\n2\n1\n2\npi\u03b12S\n6E4T\nm2g\u02dc\nM2\n\u03b22g\u02dc , (74)\nd\u03c3\u02c6incl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 g\u02dcg\u02dc) = 27\n2\n1\n2\npi\u03b12S\n6E2TM\n2\n[(\n1\u2212 2E\n2\nT\nM2\n)(\n1\u2212 2m\n2\ng\u02dc\nE2T\n)\n+\nm2g\u02dc\nE2T\n(\n1 + \u03b22g\u02dc\n)]\n, (75)\nd\u03c3\u02c6excl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq) = 4pi\u03b1\n2\nS\n12M4\nm4q\u02dc\nE4T\n, (76)\nd\u03c3\u02c6incl\ndt\n(ggPP \u2192 q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq) = 2pi\u03b1\n2\nS\n12M4\n(\n1 \u2212 2m\n2\nq\u02dc\nE2T\n+\n2m4q\u02dc\nE4T\n)\n. (77)\nNote that (74) and (75) are the same as (50) and (52) for colour-singlet gg \u2192 qq\u00af, except for\nthe colour-factor 27\/2, and a factor 1\/2 which reflects the Majorana nature of the two gluinos.\nThe \u03b23 behaviour of exclusive gluino-pair production arises from \u03b22 of the last factor of (74)\nand \u03b2 from the integration over t. The cross sections shown in (76) and (77) are written for\none flavour and one type (L or R) of squark q\u02dc.\nNear threshold the formula have to be modified to account for sparticle widths and the QCD\nCoulomb interaction [41, 42]. Unfortunately the cross sections are very small near threshold.\nFor example, if we take sparticle masses of 250 GeV and integrate from threshold (500 GeV)\nup to 625 GeV, then we find\n\u2206\u03c3\u02c6excl(g\u02dcg\u02dc) \u2243 6.5 pb, \u2206\u03c3\u02c6excl(q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq) \u2243 1.8 pb. (78)\nFor comparison the tt\u00af cross section, integrated from threshold up to 437 GeV, corresponding\nto the same value of \u03b2 = 0.6, is\n\u2206\u03c3\u02c6excl(tt\u00af) \u2243 2.2 pb. (79)\nAfter multiplying by the double-diffractive luminosities of 2\u00d7 10\u22125 for g\u02dcg\u02dc and 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 for tt\u00af\nwe have\n\u2206\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+ g\u02dcg\u02dc + p) \u2243 0.15 fb (80)\n\u2206\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+ q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq + p) \u2243 0.04 fb (81)\n\u2206\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+ tt\u00af+ p) \u2243 0.1 fb (82)\n13At the moment we have no clear understanding which of these sparticles is the lightest, but the conventional\nbelief is that the stop t\u02dc is the lightest squark.\n25\nfor \u2018near\u2019 threshold production at the LHC. It is quite plausible that the masses of the light\nsquark flavours are nearly degenerate, as are the masses of q\u02dcL and q\u02dcR. This may allow a higher\nrate of q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq events.\nAnother possibility to increase the yield of SUSY production is to consider the inclusive\nconfiguration of Fig. 1(b). Then the effective luminosity (\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22123) is much larger. The\ncorresponding subprocess cross sections, integrated from threshold (500 GeV) up to 625 GeV,\nare\n\u2206\u03c3\u02c6incl(g\u02dcg\u02dc) \u2243 24 pb, \u2206\u03c3\u02c6incl(q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq) \u2243 1 pb, (83)\nleading to\n\u2206\u03c3(pp \u2192 X + g\u02dcg\u02dc + Y ) \u2243 50 fb, (84)\n\u2206\u03c3(pp \u2192 X + q\u02dc\u02dc\u00afq + Y ) \u2243 2 fb. (85)\n3.6 Soft Phenomena\nFinally, we discuss the possibility to study soft strong interactions in diffractive events with two\n(or more) rapidity gaps (see, for example, [50, 51]). The (total) cross section of the Pomeron-\nPomeron interaction is proportional to the square of the triple Pomeron coupling g3IP . If we\ntake the parameters from the analysis of Ref. [3] then we obtain the subprocess cross section\n\u03c3\u02c6t(IPIP ) \u2243 1.2 mb. (86)\nWhen we multiply by the \u201csoft IPIP\u201d luminosity of Section 2.3, shown in Fig. 2, we predict a\ntwo rapidity gap cross section\n\u03c32 \u223c 1\u2212 10 \u00b5b, (87)\ndepending on the gap size. For the LHC it gives a very large event rate, which may be measured\nin a low luminosity (high \u03b2 optics) run.\nSuch events offer an excellent opportunity to answer the many outstanding, interesting\nquestions which remain from the intensive studies of soft physics of 25 or more years ago (see,\nfor example, [51, 52]). A key problem is that the cross section of events containing n rapidity\ngaps is of the form\n\u03c3n \u223c (g3IP ln s)2n\/(2n)!, (88)\nwhich grows with energy. On summing, we have a cross section \u03c3 \u223c (s)g3IP , which appears to\nviolate unitarity. We must find a mechanism to suppress this huge cross section. We recall the\nscenarios which were considered long ago.\n(i) To obtain a self consistent asymptotic theory it was proposed that the triple Pomeron\ncoupling vanishes when the momentum transferred through the Pomeron goes to zero,\ng3IP (t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 0. (89)\n26\nThe diffractive data do not confirm this proposal, although in the presence of strong\nIP -cuts it is still an open question. The study of double-Pomeron-exchange processes in\nlow luminosity LHC runs, where the small t region becomes accessible, would clarify the\nsituation (see [52] and references therein).\n(ii) It was suggested that the soft survival probability S\u02c62 becomes much smaller for events\nwith many gaps. The available CDF data [53], on double and single diffractive production,\nindicate otherwise, but again it should be checked at LHC energies.\n(iii) It is more natural to expect S\u02c62 does not depend strongly on the number of gaps, but rather\nto propose that S\u02c62 decreases rapidly with increasing energy. In this scenario, rapidity gap\nevents only occur in peripheral (large impact parameter) collisions where the opacity \u2126(b)\nis still small. It follows that mean transverse momentum of the secondaries \u3008kt\u3009 created\nin the central IPIP collisions of Fig. 1(c) will be smaller than \u3008kt\u3009 for the usual inelastic\ninteraction at an equivalent energy,\n\u221a\nsinel =M [54]. This prediction could be checked at\nthe LHC.\nWe emphasize that processes with 3 or more rapidity gaps have not yet been seen. It is\nclearly crucial to detect such events. To estimate \u03c33, \u03c34, . . ., we assume factorization, and the\nsame survival factor S\u02c62 for \u03c31, \u03c32, \u03c33, . . .. Then the probability to observe an additional rapidity\ngap will be\n\u03c9gap =\n(\n\u03c3DD\n\u03c3inelS\u02c62\n)\n, (90)\nwhere we cancel the factor S\u02c62 in the empirical double-diffractive cross section \u03c3DD, since the\nsurvival factor S\u02c62 is the same for all \u03c3n. Of course, we have to account for the phase space\navailable for each gap. To make a phenomenological estimate, we start with the two-gap process\nof Fig. 1(c) and evaluate the probability to observe a third gap at the Pomeron-Pomeron energy\u221a\nsIPIP =M . For the LHC it corresponds to\n\u221a\nsIPIP \u223c 300 GeV. Using the existing data in the\nISR to Tevatron energy range, together with the S\u02c62 calculations of Ref. [3], we find\n\u03c9gap \u2243 0.2\u2212 0.4 (91)\nand\n\u03c33 \u2243 \u03c9gap\u03c32 \u223c 0.3\u2212 3 \u00b5b. (92)\nAnother possible soft phenomenon which is worth investigation is the \u201celastic\u201d Pomeron-\nPomeron scattering process\nIPIP \u2192 XGY G, (93)\nwhere XG and Y G are glueball states. We call it elastic as the glueballs may lie on the Pomeron\ntrajectory. That is there may exist a glueball dominance model of the Pomeron, in analogy to\nthe vector meson dominance model of the photon.\n27\n4 Conclusions\nIn this paper we summarize, and extend, the results of our previous studies of double-diffractive\nprocesses with a rapidity gap on either side of a centrally produced heavy system. We have\nattempted to present the results in a unified, and user-friendly, form so that the expected cross\nsections at the Tevatron and the LHC can be readily estimated, simply by multiplying the\nappropriate luminosity of Section 2 with the relevant subprocess cross section \u03c3\u02c6 of Section 3.\nWe hope that it provides a useful framework to study double-diffractive phenomena, not only\nin their own right but also as a tool to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. Although\nmany cross sections are predicted to be small, there are several interesting processes with viable\nsignals. In particular, the exclusive double-diffractive production of an intermediate mass Higgs\nboson at the LHC, and the possibility of using the Tevatron and the LHC as a \u2018pure\u2019 gluon\nfactory. For example, for the production of a Higgs boson of mass MH = 120 GeV at the LHC\nwe predict a cross section\n\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+H + p) \u2243 3 fb, (94)\nwith a signal-to-QCD background ratio of\nS(H \u2192 bb\u00af)\nB(bb\u00af)\n>\u223c 15\n(\n250 MeV\n\u2206M\n)\n, (95)\nwhere \u2206M is the experimental missing-mass resolution.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Mike Albrow, Brian Cox, Gian Giudice, Dino Goulianos, Beate Heinemann, Aliosha\nKaidalov, Risto Orava, Robi Peschanski, Krzysztof Piotrzkowski, Stuart Raby, Albert de Roeck,\nAndrei Shuvaev, Stefan Tapprogge and Georg Weiglein for interesting discussions.
