We analysed and compared \nnational education systems and principals\u2019 selection and training using documents, \nfocus groups, principals\u2019 interviews and an international seminar. The most \ncentralised systems of Greece and Cyprus had less principal preparation, and more \ngovernment involvement in principal selection, than the less centralised Sweden and \nEngland. The extent of training was perceived to matter less in successful \nprincipalship than selecting the right people although  it was felt that even a good \nleader can be improved through training and principals were concerned about their \nlack of formal training.  \n \n \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?2  \nKEY WORDS  \nLeadership training; England; Cyprus; Sweden; Greece. \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?3  \nSchool Principal Preparation In Europe \nIntroduction \n            This article reports part of a 2001-2002 European Union (EU) funded study of \nschool principals' preparation in England1, Greece, Cyprus2 and Sweden, led by  xxx \n(name deleted for blind review process0. This initiative is part of many movements to \nEuropean integration, described in the first part of this article concerning our research \nprovenance. Our research techniques, discussed in the article\u2019s second section, were \nexploratory because conceptual frameworks for cross-cultural studies in education \nleadership are only in their infancy (Dimmock and Walker, 1998; Richmon and \nAllison, 2003) and because comparative research on which we might model our \nproject, is rare though examples are now emerging (International Studies in \nEducational Administration,  31 [2] passim). \n The subsequent sections of this article are from material collected for the \nfunded research whose outcome had to be distance learning materials for school \nleaders\u2019 preparation. Creating such transnational  resources is regarded as very \nchallenging (Van den Brandon and Lambert, 1999). To cope with this, we decided to \nfocus our group investigations on assessing how far our attitudes were similar on \nvarious major topics of educational leadership issues. These eventually became the \ntopics in the CD-ROM masters degree module for school principals in any European \ncountry3 which we designed as the outcome of this project.  \nThis article concentrates on one of these topics, principal preparation systems. \nWe began by investigating what similarities there were in our national education \nsystems to see if there is sufficient in common amongst our schools\u2019 needs to make \nfeasible any common training for leaders and to ascertain what leaders might find \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?4  \nuseful to help them to cope with individual national circumstances. The outcome of \nthis comparative review of our four countries\u2019 education systems is summarised in the \nthird section of this article.  \nFollowing this, we reviewed what training principals currently receive in our \ncountries and interviewed principals to find out their views on how  they had been \nselected and trained for principalship. This is reported in sections four and five of this \narticle.  \nOur reflections on how to train leaders inevitably raised questions for us about \nthe roles of leaders which led to a section in the CD ROM on Successful Leadership. \nMoving on from this led us to develop a new concept of Mediated Leadership as a \ncompromise amongst differing attitudes to democracy and hierarchy in school \norganisation. Finally, throughout the project, we discussed, reflected and analysed the \nCD ROM topic, European education leadership \u2013 towards consensus on a definition. \nWe conclude this article with a brief flavour of this elusive topic.  \nReaders from outside of Europe will find it valuable to compare and contrast \ntheir leadership preparation systems with ours. In the four countries in this study, what \nis offered to putative principals extends along a continuum from very little at one end, \nto what could almost be described as 'overkill' at the other. Similarly, our education \nsystems range through extensive, moderate and slight centralisation. One of these \ntypes should offer some similarities to your own states, countries or provinces and \nthus offer you insights for transferable ideas or for approaches you might want to \navoid. The authors welcome your reactions. Our team had a fascinating journey  \nlearning about each other\u2019s systems; we anticipate that you too will enjoy the travel. \n \n \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?5  \n \nResearch provenance: European integration \nThere is extensive literature on school principalship preparation but this is \nlargely dominated by texts from, and about, North America, Australasia and the \nUnited Kingdom or is related to each of the four  countries separately (Pashiardis, \n1995, 1997; Pashiardis and Orphanou, 1999). In Europe, there have been scattered \nefforts to develop the field but no attempt to explore a possible European alliance, or \njoint approach to leadership selection and training. The prospects seemed gloomy in \nthe light of experiences in other education professions (see Budge\u2019s views on the \ninspectorate for example, 1999) but important  as the EU expands into a possible \nUnited States of Europe.    \nThe project began as ten of the EU countries launched a joint currency  in \n2002 and concluded as first drafts of a European Constitution were being prepared in \n2003. This article is contemporaneous with the EU\u2019s expansion with ten more \nmembers. All these developments were part of an integration which began in 1947 \nwhen the USA's Marshall Plan offered aid to rebuild a war-destroyed European \neconomy provided that the nations of Europe collaborated to decide how to use that \naid. From that impetus six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community \n(ECSC), the European Atomic Community (EURATOM) and the European \nEconomic Community (EEC) in the 1950s. \nThe four countries in this research have been active in European integration4 \nbut not in those first movements towards the European Union of today of which all \nare now members (England, 1973; Greece, 1981; Sweden, 1995; Cyprus, 2004). As \nEuropean integration proceeded, groups from many different professions began to \nmeet at governmental levels to produce common policies, standards, qualifications \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?6  \nand processes. Everything seems to have been included in these integration efforts \nfrom the sizes of fish tins, meat tins and little metal bottle tops, to medical degrees, \ntractor tyres, human rights, clothing sizes, legal sovereignties and the terminology for \nchocolate bars. Almost everything that is, except for education and schooling systems. \nEducation remains one of the responsibilities and rights reserved to the nation \nstates in the EU but the EU has gradually found a way into some aspects of education \nthrough its social policy duties5. To encourage such education developments by \nlearning from each other's educational practices, non-governmental organisations of \nenthusiasts have brought together educational leaders and researchers as in the British \nEducation Leadership, Management and Administration Society (BELMAS), the \nCyprus Educational Administration Society (CEAS) (both starting in the 1970s) and \nthe European  Forum on Educational Administration (EFEA) (Lafond, 1995). Such \norganisations have encouraged a focus on principals\u2019 preparation. Thus developments \nin our own field and in wider European integration motivated this research project.    \n \nResearch Techniques \n The spine of the project was four focussed discussion groups, two day \nmeetings of four university researchers, one from each nation6. These occurred  at \nthree month intervals over twelve months, each in a different country.  Between \nmeetings, researchers collated primary and secondary documentary data on their \nnational preparation systems according to frameworks negotiated at the early \nmeetings, exchanged this through email and conducted semi-structured interviews \nwith principals in each country to obtain practitioner perspectives. The project \nculminated with a seminar at an international conference when delegates from North \nAmerica and from many European countries discussed the results.  \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?7  \nPart of the first group meeting in Sweden in 2001 was tape recorded and later \ntranscribed verbatim, edited, analysed and reviewed at subsequent meetings.  To \naccord with European traditions, the final 2003 seminar was arranged as a Romano-\nGreek  symposium, accompanied by wine and grapes. This, and the excellent \nchairmanship of Professor Paul Bredeson,  may account for the enthusiastic \nparticipation of the audience. This session was videoed, transcribed verbatim, edited \nand analysed.  \nPan-European educational leadership research is so exploratory that there was \nno earlier research on which we might model our processes. We were not even sure \nthat we had common words through which we might consult others through, for \nexample, surveys. We needed to develop both our ideas and the semantics for our \nfield of study.  We had not worked as a group before and each of us had not \npreviously met at least some of the other participants so we needed time to get to \nknow each other. The joint development of ideas through four consecutive focussed \ngroups seemed an ideal way to do this. Fuelled with coffee and chocolates, the talk \nflowed readily and maintained a tight orientation. The conversations provided,  \n\u2018individual perspectives in an environment where judgements are not \nautomatically expressed ... a relational and participatory way of \nthinking ... Each participant ... .has the responsibility to push the \nunderstandings and learnings of a group ... to a shared basic perception, \nto a greater sensitivity in perceiving subtle meanings around us\u2019 \n(Ackerman, 1998, 19). \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?8  \nThese discussions certainly met Morgan\u2019s (1988) conditions for focus groups \nthat \u2018participants have something to say and feel comfortable enough to say it\u2019 \n(cited in Cohen, Manion and Morrison, 2000:288).   \nWe deviated from Kreuger\u2019s criteria for focus groups (1998) since we were \nfive (later four) rather than six participants but Morgan (1988) sees the norm as any \nnumber between four and twelve. We did not use a single facilitator as Kreuger \nrecommends (op cit); instead we all operated as participant facilitators. This was ideal \nin these circumstances where we had no previously prescribed topics to cover and it \nwas from the group\u2019s interactions that the subjects emerged. It is such interactions that \nare the heart of focussed group research and which keep \u2018the meeting open ended but \nto the point\u2019 (Cohen et al, 2000:288)  \nSemi-structured interviews were conducted by this articles\u2019 authors, with an \nopportunity sample of two principals from state (public) primary (elementary) and \nsecondary schools in each country (one in Sweden) in early 2002. It was not possible \nto obtain exactly comparable samples and interview methods but the data did provide \nvital practitioner insights. The team records its most grateful thanks to the principals \nwho agreed to be interviewed. Some wished to remain anonymous; others did not. We \nrespected their respective wishes in our reports below.  It is possible that their wishes \nwere a reflection of their education systems: English and Swedish  whose \u2018success\u2019 \nmight be deemed  relative to their  individual  schools,  did not request anonymity; \nGreek and Cypriot principals whose \u2018success\u2019 could be seen as fitting in with a \ncentralized system,  did request anonymity. \nThe principals were first contacted by telephone, email or letter.  Once an \ninitial and positive contact had been made this was followed up as soon as possible by \nan outline of the questions and the purpose for the interviews. Five interviews took \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?9  \nplace in the principals' offices though the English interviews were by telephone. The \nSwedish interview was by email. The school library housed one of the Greek \ninterviews.  All interviews were semi-structured around the same themes but we \nfound that different national experiences and languages meant that we did not always \nobtain comparable data. What was important in one country, did not gain a mention in \nanother. Interviewees were assured that they could raise additional issues and could \nexpress plainly his\/her opinions and feelings. In England and Greece, each interview \nlasted about one hour, in Cyprus, ninety minutes.  The timings were by mutual \nagreement between interviewees and interviewer. \nThe Cypriot and Greek conversations were taped and transcribed. The English \ninterviewer typed the notes to a word processor while the telephone interview was in \nprogress using a hands free, loud speaker telephone. There was some clipping of \nwords and the noise of the word processor keys sometimes inhibited hearing. Edited \ntranscripts were made available to the principals involved for such revisions, additions \nor excisions as they might wish to make.  The email interview exchanges with \nSweden were automatically checked by the interviewee in the exchange of  emails.  \n \nOur national education systems    \n          In seeking to understand how far the roles of principals varied amongst our four \ncountries, we focussed particularly on the extent of their autonomy because European \neducational systems since the 1970s, have experimented with various forms of school \nself-government. Greece and Cyprus are very centralised systems in all aspects. All \nEngland's schools are self-managing businesses but with strong central government \ncurricular control. Sweden comes between these two extremes with less extensive self \nmanagement than that in England, less extensive centralisation than that in Greece and \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?10  \nCyprus but greater local government responsibilities for education than in the other \nthree countries.  \n         In all four countries, school leadership has become more complex and \ndemanding as curricular demands have grown, parental, government expectations and \ndemands for greater school effectiveness have been raised and there have been \nchanges in attitudes to how children and adults learn. For Sweden\u2019s and England\u2019s \nprincipals, accountability and competition have extended: local site-based \nmanagement has made principals directly responsible for school quality and \nperformance and parents and community leaders in both Sweden and England have \nbecome more powerful on school councils and governing bodies.  \n          All four countries have national curricula for compulsory schooling (nine years \nin Sweden and Greece, ten in Cyprus, eleven in England).  This is least prescriptive in \nSweden but the principals\u2019 roles in all four countries can be described as they are in \nSweden.  First, principals guarantee a nationally equivalent education; every school is \nrequired to meet the national standards, regardless of where it is located and its \nworking conditions. Secondly, principals guarantee pupils\u2019 and parents\u2019 rights and \nthat their schools\u2019 education meets national quality standards. Thirdly, principals \ndevelop the educational activities at their  schools.  \n          In Cyprus, Greece and England the dominance of the national curriculum is \nreinforced by state-set examinations and, in Greece and Cyprus, by state required \ntextbooks. The examinations are most extensive in England with national standards \nand tests of these at 7, 11 and 13; public examinations at 16 and 18 are set by national, \nbut independent, examination boards. Cypriot and Greek schools set their own \nexaminations until the national tests at the end of secondary education. England\u2019s \nprincipals are particularly concerned about their schools\u2019 examination results as these \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?11  \nare published in the media with schools ranked in national league tables. School \ninspectors have great powers in England where their reports can close down schools \ndeemed to be failing their pupils. In Cyprus, inspectors grade principals which then \ndetermines their promotion to inspector. Greece and Sweden have a more advisory \napproach in their school inspections.  \n           In running the business of the school, England\u2019s principals are far more \nautonomous than their counterparts in the other three countries. This is encouraged \nthrough the appointment system; England\u2019s principals are chosen, employed and can \nbe dismissed by the individual governing bodies of their schools. Sweden\u2019s principals \nowe allegiance to their appointing municipalities while Greek and Cypriot principals \nare centrally appointed. Further, England\u2019s schools are each financially autonomous \nand principals must manage their own budgets.   This does not apply in any of the \nother three countries although finance for all our countries\u2019 schools is state provided \n(through various combinations of local and central governments).  \n            Principals have to respond to their staff as well as to governments. Traditions \nof teacher autonomy are strong in Sweden so that the principals can often be pressed \nbetween the rocks of central and local government demands and those of the teachers. \nIn Cyprus, it is the teacher\u2019s union which provides the countervailing force. In Greece \nand England, teachers are less powerful but in England, it is the principal who \nappoints, promotes and disciplines the teachers for his\/her school; in the other three \ncountries, central or local governments hold these responsibilities. Teacher \ncertification is regulated by state agencies in all four countries as is the content of pre-\nservice teacher training.  Principals are responsible for appraising their staff though \nthis ranges from a regulated annual system in England to a much less organised one in \nCyprus.  \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?12  \nLeadership preparation overview \n         The differing degrees of centralisation in our respective systems seem reflected \nin leadership preparation provision. Countries in which principals\u2019 roles are mainly to \nadminister state policies, with little autonomy allowed, have less training for \nprincipalship than those where leaders have to manage their schools more \nindividually. Hence, only as recently as the late 1990s, have Greek principals been \noffered optional short, in-service training courses, run by the Ministry of Education. \nIn addition some principals have chosen voluntarily to attend relevant courses \nprovided by the National School of Public Administration. Cyprus has no leadership \npreparation programmes though the Ministry of Education provides one-year \nmanagement courses. Cyprus has university courses in educational administration but \nthose opting to take them are unlikely to become principals until many years after \ncourse completion because of the seniority of service rules. Sweden provides regional \npreparation once principals have been selected and educational administration can be \ntaken as a component of university degrees. England's principals have a national \ncollege, national pre-service, induction and in-service courses and qualifications and \npre-service national principal assessment processes; for almost forty years there have \nbeen university educational administration degrees and school district short courses \nfor both pre-service and in-service principals. In none of the four countries is formal \npreparation compulsory though it is likely that the state's national certification will \nsoon be compulsory in England.   \n          The varying extents of formal preparation are reflected in the requirements for \nprincipals\u2019 activities. The duties and responsibilities of Cypriot school principals are \nprescribed by the Ministry of Education and Culture and of Greek principals by \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?13  \neducation law. England has an extensive list of nationally agreed principals\u2019 \ncompetency descriptors. Sweden has a short list of agreed roles.  \n             Our first focussed discussion group in 2001 showed how much our views \nabout the extent of training needed by principals were influenced by our own systems \neven where we were critical of these.  You will, however, sense, in the extracts from \nthe discussions below, a tentative consensus emerging about the respective values of \ntraining, experience and personality in the effective preparation of leaders.  \nSpeakers  In the following transcript, identified as \n1,2,3,4  - will be identified after \nblind review  \n \n  \n  \n  \n2: Of course excellency in principalship is not a matter of mere training.   \n3:  [But] the good leaders that I have seen in Cyprus ... had no training \nwhatsoever in educational administration.  I don\u2019t think I would argue, \nhowever. that they were \u2018born to lead\u2019.  All I am saying is that they can \nexist.. \n2: They have a strong educational philosophy ... Highly important is their \ntheoretical and political thinking which means how they envisage the \nnext generation as citizens of the twenty first century ...  they can \ninspire people. \n3: And they are good observers of behaviour.  When I asked school \nprincipals in Cyprus about their preparation ... [they] ... said, \u201cWell I \nlearnt through the mistakes of others, that is not to repeat them\u201d when \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?14  \nthey were teachers and watching their own principals.  Some said  \u201cI \nwas inspired by an excellent principal I had and I\u2019m complimenting that \nand taking it a bit further.\u201d  None of those I interviewed had any formal \ntraining. \n4: It seems to me that in Cyprus and Greece, you are where England was \nin the 1970s, when we could say there were good leaders in schools but \nthere wasn\u2019t any training then.  Training began with various, non-\naccredited short courses during the 1970s. Gradually, this expanded to \npost-graduate degree programmes, mentoring and post-appointment \ntraining courses in the 1980s and early 1990s. By the end of the 1990s, \nthere was national preparation, post-appointment and professional \ndevelopment ... .So ... do we really need this training?  It\u2019s a very \npertinent question since obviously you are currently developing training \nfor educational leaders in Greece and Cyprus, and we\u2019ve come together \nas a group specifically to develop our various national approaches into \npotentially Europeanised and European-wide training. Sweden and \nEngland have ever  growing provision. Are we just assuming that all \nthis training is really needed? We all appeared to  agree  that there is  a \n\u2018something\u2019 in leadership that can\u2019t be put in by training.   \n3: Perhaps we need training because we have a thousand principals and \nmaybe only ten of them spontaneously have the visioning abilities we  \ndescribed above as necessary for good educational organisations? ...   \n2: Yes but how can one person acquire all of this educational philosophy \n... ? It is a long term process. It cannot be acquired in six months \ntraining or one year ...  \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?15  \n 1:  ... we have had a strong tradition in Sweden for the last twenty years \nthat we learn from our practice.  Basically ... those in ...  leadership \npositions, come together to reflect and  think about what they have done  \nand what can be learnt from this ... [but] there will be a limit to the \nlearning we can acquire from our practice ... There is another arena ... \n[of] philosophies and models for education [and a] third ... - research \nwhich involves studying the practices of others as well as our own ... \nFrom these three arenas combined  comes  new knowledge ...  Good \neducational leaders realise this because they are learners themselves.. \n 4: I\u2019d agree with that absolutely.  In England we have strong traditions  \n            of practitioner research which have largely emerged from action  \n            research methodology. From the late 1990s, our government supported  \n            practitioner research financially. School principals can obtain from the  \n            Department for Education and Skills, a \u2018best practice\u2019 grant to do some  \n            studies in their own schools and to go and research comparisons in  \n            other schools in England and abroad ... \n  \n Principal preparation systems in Cyprus, England, Greece and Sweden. \nOur next task was to open our minds to possibilities from each other's \ncountry's principal preparation systems. A summary of the information we gathered is \ngiven below. All four systems showed different ways of tackling the dilemma of \nensuring that principals adhere to their central governments' expectations of schooling \nwhile recognising that principalship is essentially a role in which the incumbent must \nbe able to operate effectively alone.  \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?16  \nIn Cyprus, principals, deputy principals and heads of departments at primary \nand secondary level receive compulsory one-year, weekly, in-service training \nprovided by the Pedagogical Institute. These courses concern management  duties and \nresponsibilities which the Ministry of Education and Culture deems important for \nschool administration. In general, there is no requirement for any certificated external \neducation (e.g. Masters Degrees) in order for someone to be appointed to any \nadministrative position and there are no short courses run by consultants or local \neducation authorities. The assumption underlying these practices in Cyprus, is that \ngood teachers should become good managerial principals  and do not need leadership \npreparation (Pashiardis, 1997). \nDecisions on promotion to principal are made by the Cypriot Educational \nService Commission which supposedly has regard to years of service, worth and \nexcellence as a teacher and diplomas, degrees or other academic credentials in order \nto create the list from which it chooses new assistant principals and principals. \nHowever, since all candidates have much the same academic qualifications and \nbecause almost everybody is regarded as an excellent teacher, the only significant \ndifferentiation comes from counting years in service - the seniority system which \ntakes little account of competency or suitability for principalship.  There is also \nevidence that those appointed as principals belong to a particular political party and  \nprincipals, academics and UNESCO have criticised this system for producing a \ndemoralised profession and stagnating schools (Drake et al, 1997, pp.26, 56-58; \nPashiardis and Ribbins, 2000). This results in a system where the average age of \nprincipals on first appointment is around 55 years.  They are then faced with the \nprospect of compulsory retirement at age 60.  \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?17  \nAnd how is the appointment made? A few years ago, once a candidate had the \nnecessary points his\/her name appeared on the list to be promoted without applying. \nNow candidates must apply and face an interview conducted by the Education Service \nCommission. The candidate is informed of the school to which he\/she is appointed \nonly very shortly before taking up post so there is no time to prepare.  \nOnce appointed, Cypriot principals essentially sink or swim alone. The \nMinistry of Education offers a few induction seminars but these are not found helpful. \nTypically new principals are sent to a rural school for a period of two years before \nbeing brought into one of the towns. They usually stay in a specific school for \nbetween two and four years, depending upon the length of time they have until \nretirement. \nEngland's school principals  are likely to be veterans of specialist \nqualifications in educational leadership, from a university post-graduate Masters or \nDoctoral programme, and\/or central government\u2019s accredited preparation (National \nProfessional Qualification for Principals - NPQH) or in-service courses and from \nmany non-award bearing courses from business or local education authority (LEA) \nspecialists (Tomlinson et al, 1999; Brundett, 2001). All but a very few7 primary and \nsecondary school principals will have had extensive previous experience as teachers \nwho have progressed through various levels of leadership responsibilities, invariably \nspending time as a middle manager (e.g. Key Stage Co-ordinator in primary schools, a \nHead of Department or Year in secondary schools) and then in a school's Senior \nManagement Team as a Deputy or Acting Head before gaining a principalship.  \nA National College for School Leaders was inaugurated in 2000 thus forming \nthe apex of a hierarchy of national competency organised tests and standards for \neducationalists\u2019 accreditation (TTA, 1997) through which the majority of principals \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?18  \nnow pass.  This comes after around twenty years of a slow movement to nationalised, \ncompulsory, competency-led and accredited training schemes for potential and \nprincipals (Thody, 1997; Brundrett, 1999) which accelerated suddenly after 1997. This \nfitted in with the both needs of principals running competent businesses within central \nguidelines and with comparable competency based training developments in other \nprofessions.  \nUniversities developed postgraduate programmes in educational leadership \nfrom the mid-1970s onwards, beginning with MSc degrees in education management \nand then extending to MBAs as the business orientation of school leadership grew. \nDoctorates in educational leadership commenced in the early 1990s. These courses \nare not standardised across the country. University degrees remain a significant, but \nminority pursuit as preparation for headship.  \n         All these degrees offer a wide education in both the theories and practices of \nleadership in order to produce reflective practitioners (Schon, 1987) through action \nlearning and a research orientation. Most are course-work assessed and this course \nwork is self-selected topics of relevance to a participant\u2019s own needs in education.  \nThose commencing the road to headship since 2002 will almost certainly \nundertake the NPQH. This includes a period at an assessment centre when experts test \ntheir abilities and advise on suitability for headship. If  approved, putative heads will \nundertake the NPQH  which concerns management competencies and skills in \nstrategic direction and accountability, modules on learning and teaching, people and \nrelationships and effective management of financial and physical resources (Bush, \n1998).  Its aim is to create accountable principals capable of improving pupils\u2019 \nachievements. \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?19  \nAfter finishing, or during completion of. the NPQH, candidates apply for \nheadships advertised in the national press.  Each school's governing body8 selects, \ninterviews and appoints the principal. Neither local (school district) nor central, \ngovernments have any power over who is appointed to a school headship.  \nOnce appointed, all new heads receive a funds allocation to spend on their \ntraining over two years as each principal deems best for his\/her own needs, e.g. on \nshort or degree courses, on mentoring or consultancy.  LEAS also provide induction \ntraining so it is available nationally but its content will vary in different areas.   \nIn the late 1990s, a national refresher programme for experienced principals \nwas established, the  Leadership Programme for Serving Principals (TTA, 1998). This \nbegins with appraisal of the principal\u2019s competency by assessors, the principal and by \nstaff and governors of the principal\u2019s school. LPSH then concentrates on \nindividualised development but there is central direction and control through a pre-set \ncurriculum, centrally produced training materials, standardised assessment criteria for \nentrants, standardised training materials and common training for trainers. \n           In Greece, at the time of writing, there are no national plans to establish \nsystematic education and training for putative, newly appointed, or long serving, \nprincipals; the majority of the school leaders today do not receive any specific training \n(Mavroskoufis, 1992, Papanaoum 1995, Saitis, Tsiamassi & Chatzi 1997).  They \nperform their role based more on their experience and intuition than on systematic \ntraining. (Saitis and Gounaropoulos, 2001, p. 87). Since the late 1990s,however,  \nmany principals have been offered optional short, in-service training courses, run by \nthe Ministry of Education and some have chosen voluntarily to attend relevant courses \nprovided by the National School of Public Administration. \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?20  \nSchool leaders are selected on the basis of their seniority in the profession and \nnot according to their managerial abilities, as two basic elements are absent: job \ndescription and job specialization (Saitis et al, 1997, 67). Since the early 1990s, \ndditional criteria for the selection of school leaders have been considered, such as \neducation and training in general and training in Educational Administration and \nManagement.  The latter has a deeply legislative, rather than leadership, orientation. \nTeacher training includes modules relevant to educational administration and \nmanagement or to the educational legislative framework, where a full description of \nthe educational system of administration is made and issues of educational school \nmanagement similar to those offered in many European countries (Lainas, 2000, p. \n32). \nThe problem is that there is not an holistic and long term plan for the training \nof educational leaders. It seems reasonable to establish a National School of \nEducational Administration, which could coordinate the training provisions all over \nthe country and guarantee the quality of the qualifications. Besides it is necessary to \nestablish a new selection system and determine a clear framework of authority and \nresponsibility (Saitis, 1997) \nIn Sweden, principals\u2019 leadership preparation has been running for over twenty-\nfive years, with some revisions from 2002 after a long period slowly adopting a new \nattitude to the principalship (Nygren and Johansson, 2000).   Principals are educated \nto meet the brief national standards for principalship9 under the National Training \nProgramme for Head-Teachers (Heimer, 1998): \n\u00be The recruitment training programme for persons who want to become principals \nand the introduction training programme are to help new principals with practical \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?21  \nadministration but also to emphasise that the principal's role is as the pedagogical \nleader. Courses vary amongst different municipalities.  \n\u00be The National Principals'  Training Programme is offered at universities, to all \nprincipals after about two years in office. This two-year  programme comprises \naround thirty seminar days to deepen principals\u2019 knowledge and understanding of \nthe national school system, the national goals for the school and the role of the \nschool in society and the local community. It is well-funded and run by the central \nNational Agency for Education. It is based on an holistic view of the school and \nits relationship with the local community. The training emphasises reflective \nleadership. \n\u00be The continuation school leader programme is university courses for school \nleaders but these have not been popular. \nAdmission to the training takes place in consultation with the school board for the \nschool to which the head teacher belongs. Each board is responsible for each \nparticipant being offered reasonable time for his\/her own studies and adequate \nfinancial reimbursement.  \n    The aim of the Swedish training is that head teachers should develop and use a \ndemocratic, learning and communicative form of leadership. This is similar to the \nemphasis placed on team work and communication skills for leaders of England\u2019s \nschools. Swedish training also emphasises pupils' goal achievement and development \nas independent learners while being able to explain and argue in support of the \nschool\u2019s national and local government goals. The content  and format of the courses \nwill vary amongst the providing universities but will emphasise case study practice \nand will include some elements similar to the USA internship.  \n \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?22  \nPrincipals' reflections on  their preparation \nOur next step was to find out from interviews how principals viewed the \nsystems outlined above. All expressed views that formal preparation was \"essential \nand crucial\"  (G2) because \"today\u2019s society and parents are very well educated and \nthey have increasing demands from their school principal to be a match for them\" \n(C1).  Only the Swede, however, had been prepared for principalship at a time when \nfull, formal, government sponsored training had been in existence. English formal \npreparation experiences for the principals interviewed had been extensive but patchy \nand not necessarily related to management. Greek and Cypriot respondents had \nreceived virtually no formal preparation. What was noticeable overall was how few \ncomments were made on this topic by the Swede though how to interpret this is not \neasy.  \nAll the interviews took place in 2002 with the following principals. \nPerson Phase Country Identifier \n* Mr Chatzios Secondary (11-18) Cyprus  C1 \n* Mr Georgiou Secondary (11-18) Cyprus C2 \nDr Daley Junior (7-11) England E1 \nMr Lyng Secondary (11-18) England E2 \nMrs Arlestig Centre for Principal Development Sweden S1 \n* Mr Vassilis Ch. Primary and secondary Greece G1 \n* Mrs Anna  P. Primary (6-12) Greece G2 \n* Anonymity requested so names are fully or partially changed \n  \n \n \n \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?23  \nSelection for principalship \nAll four countries\u2019 principals had lengthy experience as teachers, and usually \nas deputy principals, before promotion to headship  (slightly shorter for the English \nprincipals than for those in the other countries). All had taught in several schools.  \nG1 had been teaching for twenty-five years, almost four of these as a vice principal. \nG2 been working in her school for twelve years. Formerly she had been a teacher in a \nschool abroad for Greek immigrants for five years and for another five years in a \nschool for handicapped children. At the starting point of her career, she used to teach \nin a German school.One English and both Greek principals, had been appointed \nprincipal in schools in which they were already deputy, or acting, principal. All of \nthem had continued to teach during their deputy-principalships though only one was \nstill teaching regularly while a principal. Cypriot principals have to have served as \ndeputies.  \nThe value of such apprenticeship for leadership,  \n was that I discovered that I had the capacity to think and that others \nresponded to my ideas, Therefore I gained the confidence to move on \u2013 \nit gave me self-belief. It was not because of training courses (E1).  \nThe English and Swedish interviewees gained more leadership familiarity before \npromotion to deputy principalship than had their Greek and Cypriot counterparts \nbecause management powers are devolved and dispersed more widely in English and \nSwedish schools.  \nOur interviewees' differences became more pronounced as they \nproceeded to principalship. For the Cypriots, progress was: \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?24  \n kind of automatic. When you had a good grade from your inspectors as \na teacher, then automatically they would invite you at the Educational \nService Commission to be promoted (C1).  \nA principal needs the right number of points: \n to be on the list, you had to be high up.  The first time I was number 43 \nout of 50 and had no chance.  I was interviewed twice.  The second time I \nwas quite high on the list (C2).  \nUsually it is not possible to accumulate sufficient points for listing until a candidate \nreaches the late 50s but one of our interviewees was pleased to report his \"luck at \nbeing appointed in my early fifties\" (C2).  \nThe points are still needed in Cyprus but there is no longer automatic listing;  \nthose interested must now apply for posts as is customary English practice, where \napplicants must meet open competition. Both our English interviewees responded to \nadvertisements in the national, weekly, newspaper for teachers. E2, for example, was \nselected to be interviewed for five different jobs before finally getting a principalship.  \nThe English schools' governing bodies interviewed and appointed them, \nhaving taken up their references and shortlisted them. Cypriot applicants too face an \ninterview which they perceive as particularly daunting since it will be their first \nexperience of this type of dialogue:  \nThe interview was terrible.  I was shocked.  You enter a huge room.  \nThere is nothing in it but a table and some chairs and about several \npeople all looking at you.  My interview was 25 minutes long.  Some \nstayed for only 5 minutes.  I don\u2019t know why there is a difference (C2). \nIn England, interviews are longer than in Cyprus; candidates must also make a \npresentation and often take part in role plays and in-tray exercises. It will still \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?25  \nbe daunting but at least they will have done it before; every promotion on their \ncareer ladders requires an interview. The process can be valued because \n I soon realised that ...  the governors were of the same mind as me \u2013 the \ngovernors were creative as is the whole environment in this area (E1).  \nThus in England, the interview enables the candidate to find out if they want to \nlead a particular school as well as enabling the school to find out if the \ncandidate suits them.             \nDespite these differences, the questions faced by candidates sound like those \nexperienced by applicants everywhere as these examples from Cyprus show: \nThe questions they asked were 'What are you going to do to have your \nname remembered in the school to which you are first appointed?', 'What \nmust a principal do to have a well organised school?' (C2) \nPreparation for principalship \nInitially, there seemed little comfort for us as academics providing leadership \neducation; all four countries' respondents stressed how they had learnt from \nexperience, watching their principals and then deciding what they would emulate or \navoid on becoming principals themselves:  \n[my] training was almost accidental. As I developed through my career I \nwas lucky in having principals who guided me. Before becoming a \nteacher I was in the army education corps \u2013 which gave me a particular \ntype of leadership and management training. [Preparation for my \nheadship has been] mainly on the job learning (E2).   \n \nI had no training before I got the job ... I had good learning experiences \n... [from] my principal ... learning how he works and thinks, how he \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?26  \ncontrols things, how he managed things like meetings ... He ... talk[ed] to \nme about his inner thoughts ... Whatever I have learnt about being a \nprincipal I have learnt from him (C2). \nSelf-directed learning supplemented this: G2 \"got used to being informed on my own\" \nand S1 stressed that to succeed you need to take responsibility for your own learning \nas had C1: \n  I really prepared alone.  Through my involvement in the unions and \nunionism I learnt a lot and I feel that I was prepared ... I kept reading \non my own and talking and exchanging views with other colleagues \nand nothing else .  \n  Both English interviewees had Masters degrees but in subjects other \nthan management, as did one of the Greek principals who also had a non-\nrelated PhD. As was common practice in Greece, neither G1 nor G2  had \nany formal administrative training but G1 attended one preparatory seminar \non School-centered Staff Development organised by the University.  G2 \nattended seminars too but on pedagogics. E2  \"did a whole range of short \nmanagement courses, such as personnel, finance, curriculum assessment\" \nnot unlike the short courses in management attended by the Cypriot \nrespondees at the Pedgogical Institute. In contrast, E1 did  \"a diploma course \nin drama. Drama is a great boost to self esteem \u2013 it makes you feel ready to \nhave a go [at anything]\u201d. Cypriot principals will have gained points towards \npromotion through obtaining Masters degrees though, as yet, no teachers \nwith Masters degrees in educational administration are old enough to have \nacquired enough other points to become principals.  Swedish principals are \ntrained after appointment. They do not have pre-service training as it is felt \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?27  \nimportant to select people who will make good leaders before giving them \nprincipalship training.  \nTraining on the job  \nThe importance of this was stressed by all the respondents though there were \nvariations for individual circumstances. For S1, \" It was trial and error\". Expanding on \nthis, G1 stated that: \nThe passing from the role of the teacher to the role of a principal was \nhard ... I had to tackle my colleagues\u2019 reluctance to [accept] the change \n[in] the balance of power in the school [he had been vice principal] as \nwell as with my own doubts about how competent I was for such a duty. \n         To increase confidence, there were various types of induction training. The \nEnglish principals both had about ten days of local government provided short courses \non practicalities in their first year after appointment, on \"budgeting, curriculum \nplanning, personnel, IT - even how to turn on the computer (which you don\u2019t have to \ndo as the principal!)\u201d (E1).  Once through such induction, English principals have to \nagree targets each year with their governing bodies and decide on the training needed \nto achieve these.  E2 reported how supportive his governors had been with this. Both \nalso can acquire experiences from other principals at local conferences but  \u201cI hate \nthose ... they are so depressing \u2013 everyone sits around moaning\u201d (E1). Both of them \nhad taken, or were taking, a doctorate in leadership to give themselves: \n wider horizons and it helped with my stress management too\u2026meeting \nwith outsiders that took me out of this. It was the best way of getting me \ninto a thinking zone \u2013 it gave me refreshment and raised my self-esteem \n(E1),   \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?28  \nwhile E2 was interested in \"how leadership develops teaching and learning\".  The \nSwedish experience was the most extensive: \"I have gone through the national \nprogram for principals and lots of shorter municipal in-service training\" (S1).   \nLeadership professional development was not all contained in external \ncourses. During the last twenty years, the concept of the practitioner researcher has \nbecome accepted in England. E2 is developing his own work on teaching and learning \nfor local universities' teacher training courses. This is quite common and from the late \n1990s, the Department for Education and Skills began offering grants to principals to \nfacilitate their personal studies, research visits in England and internationally and \nfunds to disseminate outcomes.  \nIdeas for improving preparation \nThe Cypriot principals had the most suggestions for changing their training.  \nThose from England and Sweden felt that the current alterations in their nation's \nprogrammes had already improved on the preparation they had received but S1 added \nthat training needed to inculcate, \n the need for high expectations of our followers, pupils and results ... \npupils' involvement, responsibility and influence. To communicate so \nstakeholders understand what, how and why we do as we do.   \nCypriot colleagues wanted both in-service and degree courses which should,  \n include human relations and ways of communication with the staff and \nparents [because] If you don\u2019t cooperate correctly with your staff and \nstudents, then you don\u2019t have the whole picture for the school (C2).  \nIn more detail: \nThe principal needs to know the duties of his position, disciplinary \nmatters, rules about personnel, rules about students, all those are the \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?29  \nAlpha and the Omega of his position because he always has to face them \non a daily basis.  Then, he needs psychology and pedagogy, he needs to \nknow about parents, society, correspondence with the Ministry, he needs \nto have public speaking skills because very often he will speak in public  \n(C1).  \nConclusion \n          This last comment indicates the extent to which school principals must \ntake note of the demos of  their schools, an approach fostered  (and enforced) \nthrough state legislation in our countries. This aspect of democratic \naccountability was found in all our four systems and seemed to offer a clue \ntowards finding a common philosophy of education leadership which we might \nterm, \u2018Europeaness\u2019.  At our final seminar we considered if this had different \nfeatures from American democracy.  \nSpeaker 1:  ... the USA talks about the rights people have.  [In Europe] ...  its \nabout the way we will create a common society. So it\u2019s more ... collective [for \nus] ...  in North America, it\u2019s ...  individual10. \nSpeaker 3:  ... in America ... through this individual achievement there will \nbe some \u2018spill over\u2019 ...  into the collective good ... in most European societies it \nis the collective that is the prime and this [will have]  \u2018spill over\u2019 effect for \nindividuals ... the foundation will be democratic. \nSadly, there is no space here to develop these putative ideas but readers are invited to \nengage the authors in further debate or to consult our CD-ROM. .  \nReflecting on the issues in this article, we found that the more centralised \nsystems had less principal preparation than the less centralised ones. We found \nconsensus that getting the right people into principalship matters as much as how you \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?30  \ntrain them but that even a good leader can be improved through training. All the \nprincipals had evinced concern about their lack of formal preparation but had coped \nthrough in-service training and the lessons of experience. The less preparation they \nhad received, however, the greater appeared to be their apprehensions on taking \noffice.  \n \nPrincipal preparation in Europe - consensus?31  \nReferences \n \nAckerman,  R.H.

The government has indicated that it \nwould like to encourage this.   \n8     Each school in England and Wales has a part-elected, part appointed Governing \nBody (of teachers, parents, political party and community representatives, local \ngovernment representatives and those chosen by the school's founding authority) to \nadvise the head; the Body is legally the leader of the school. A Governing Body \nusually meets termly and usually has Committees for particular aspects of school \nbusiness such as Finance or the Curriculum or Standards. Governors are responsible \nfor setting principals\u2019 performance management targets, for their appraisals and for \ndetermining their salaries.  \n9     Curriculum for the Compulsory School, Lpo 94, Lpf 94. \n10   The theoretical origins of these differences can be seen in the works of such \nwriters as the American, Thomas Paine and the European Jean Jacques Rousseau.  \n \n"}
