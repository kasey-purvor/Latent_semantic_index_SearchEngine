In its more strategic guise, however, HRM \nis conceptualised in terms of carefully designed combinations of such practices geared toward improving \norganisational effectiveness and hence better performance outcomes, as with Wright and McMahan\u2019s \ndefinition (1992: 298): \u2018the planned HR deployments and activities intended to enable [an organisation] \nto achieve its goals\u2019 (see also Delery and Doty, 1996: 805). This latter conceptualisation is our interest \nhere. \n \nThe nature of the interaction between HRM and performance, and particularly the search for conclusive \nevidence of the decisive positive impact of the former on the latter, is for many the whole subject area\u2019s \n\u2018Holy Grail\u2019. Yet, despite the substantial empirical evidence that has been amassed worldwide in the ten \nyears since the pioneering studies into this relationship (Arthur, 1994; Guest and Hoque, 1994; Huselid, \n1995; Kalleberg and Moody, 1994; MacDuffie, 1995; Snell and Youndt, 1995), a memorable summation \nof the state of play in 1997 remains apposite. Researchers in the field still require \u2018a theory about HRM, a \ntheory about performance, and a theory about how they are linked\u2019 (Guest, 1997: 263). A review of \nprogress is therefore timely.  \n \nPrevious \u2018research on research\u2019 articles on HRM have tended to focus on one of two chief concerns. The \nfirst has been to examine the theoretical foundations of the study of HRM, with a view to revealing its \nunderlying assumptions and to generating new hypotheses to be tested (e.g. Ferris et al., 1999; Guest, \n1997; Wood, 1999). The second concern has been with issues related to methodological validity, such as \nthe research techniques used (e.g. Gerhart, 1999; Gerhart et al., 2000a and 2000b; Rogers and Wright, \n1998; Wright et al., 2001b). The starting point for our \u2018research on research\u2019 analysis was to combine \nobjectives from both previous strands - theory and method. We set out to identify how the key concepts \ninvolved in the HRM-performance debate have been formulated in empirical studies to date, why these \nconceptualisations have been favoured over others, and how each component has been operationalised.   \n \nFigure  1 HRM activities, HRM outcomes and performance (Paauwe and Richardson, 1997) i \n \n                 reversed causality \n                        +ve \n \n  \n \n          \n                    +ve \n \n \n                          +ve           +ve   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHRM activities \n \n\u2022 Recruitment\/ selection \n\u2022 HR planning \n\u2022 Rewards  \n\u2022 Participation\/ consultation \n\u2022 De-centralization \n\u2022 Training \n\u2022 Opportunity for internal promotion \n\u2022 More autonomy \n\u2022 Formal procedures \n\u2022 Coaching \n \n\u2022 Internally consistent HR \u2018bundles\u2019 \nHRM outcomes \n \n\u2022 Employee satisfaction \n\u2022 Employee motivation \n\u2022 Employee retention \n(obverse of turnover) \n\u2022 Employee presence \n(obverse of absenteeism) \n\u2022 \u2018Social climate\u2019 between \nworkers and management \n\u2022 Employee involvement \n\u2022 Trust \n\u2022 Loyalty\/ commitment \nContingency and\/ or control variables: \n \nOrganisational level: age, size, technology, capital intensity, degree of unionisation, industry\/ sector, etc. \n \nIndividual employee level: age, gender, education level, job experience, nationality, etc. \nPerformance \n \n\u2022 Profit \n\u2022 Market value  \n\u2022 Market share \n\u2022 Increase in sales \n\u2022 Productivity \n\u2022 Product\/ service \nquality \n\u2022 Customer satisfaction \n\u2022 Development of \nproducts\/ services \n\u2022 Future investments \n 2\nThe representation of the HRM-performance relationship put forward by Paauwe and Richardson (1997) - \ndepicted in Figure 1 - serves as a useful visual representation of the key issues involved.  It lays out a \ncomprehensive set of options for each \u2018box\u2019 for researchers to contemplate. From this we derived six \nresearch questions for our analysis:  \n1. How was the study conducted? In particular, what was the primary level of analysis? Who were \nthe respondents?  \n2. What was the dominant theoretical framework informing the research design?  \n3. What was the conceptualisation and operationalisation of \u2018HRM\u2019? In particular, was HRM \nviewed as a set of unconnected practices, or as a mutually reinforcing \u2018system\u2019? \n4. What was the conceptualisation and operationalisation of \u2018performance\u2019 (i.e. the outcomes of the \nHRM intervention)? \n5. Which external variables were incorporated into the research design, whether as controls or as \ncontingent moderating variables? \n6. What was understood to take place in the \u2018black box\u2019 stage between HRM and performance?  \n \nThe paper is set out as follows. The next section describes our methodology, including a profile of the \nsample of articles examined. Separate sections then summarise the treatment of each of the six questions \nin the sample. In the final sections we discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice in \nlinking HRM with performance.  \n \nMethodology \nTo render the task manageable, and to provide a credible guarantee of quality, we restricted our search \nonly to articles that have appeared in pre-eminent, international, refereed journals. This decision meant \nthat we had to exclude valuable work published in books (e.g. Lawler, Mohrman and Ledford, 1995; \nAppelbaum et al., 2000), reports (e.g. Patterson et al., 1997; Purcell et al., 2003; Watson Wyatt, 2003), \nunpublished papers and dissertations. This criterion also excluded research published in non-English-\nlanguage journals with predominantly national readerships. \n \nFollowing a similar approach used by Wright and Boswell (2002), we focussed on journals with which \nreaders of Human Resource Management Journal were likely to be familiar. Hence, our review covered \nall of the other major international journals known for their explicit HR focus (e.g. Human Resource \nManagement, International Journal of Human Resource Management, Personnel Psychology and \nPersonnel Review), and journals where HRM-related articles were more likely to be found, such as the \ngeneral management journals (e.g. Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, \nJournal of Management, Journal of Management Studies, British Journal of Management, Organisation \nStudies and Strategic Management Journal), and industrial relations journals (e.g. (Industrial Relations, \nBritish Journal of Industrial Relations, and Industrial and Labor Relations Review). We also included \noften-cited articles from less explicitly HRM-related journals, such as Kalleberg and Moody (1994) in \nAmerican Behavioral Scientist, and Ichniowski et al (1997) in American Economic Review. We did not \nhowever look through every edition of these latter journals, and other not obviously relevant journals.  \n \nWe bookended our review with the milestone studies from 1994-95, and the final journal editions of \n2003. Only articles that presented empirical research were selected. A further criterion was that each \nstudy should have reported research into the impact of multiple HRM-style practices on some measure of \nperformance, in keeping with our understanding of strategic HRM detailed above and the future research \nagenda urged by Wright and Boswell (2002). This meant our search did not include \u2018OB\u2019 (organisational \nbehaviour) journals, whose research tends to focus on the impact of single HR practices on attitudinal \nand\/or behavioural outcomes. This explains the absence of the likes of the Journal of Applied Psychology \nand the Journal of Organizational Behavior. We are not aware of any article published in either of these \njournals in the time-period that might have complied with our criterion for inclusion. As a final check we \ncompared our eventual sample against the list produced by Mark Huselid (http:\/\/www.markhuselid.com\/) \nand found no omissions.  \n \nIn total our overview draws on a comprehensive sample of 104 articles, indicated with an * in the \nReferences list. (Due to space limitations, the full list and all of our Analysis Tables can be downloaded \nfrom www.tilburguniversity.nl\/faculties\/fsw\/departments\/HRS\/research\/themes\/.) The articles were \nsourced from a wide variety of journals (Appendix 1). We are confident that we have included every \n 3\narticle in the journals searched, and every significant other study (in terms of frequent citations). In terms \nof both the number of articles reviewed and the time-period covered our review significantly extends \nthose previously produced by Ichniowski et al (1996), Guest (1997), Wood (1999), and Wright and \nBoswell (2002).ii \n \nWe went through each edition of the journals online, identified articles from their titles and abstracts that \nseemed to match our criteria, and divided our initial sample equally between the three authors. In a \nstepwise approach, each researcher content-analysed their allotted articles according to a pro-forma of \nbroad categories based on our six research questions (see Appendix 2). Upon completion, we met to settle \nupon a final sample and to resolve any issues of confusion and uncertain classifications in our respective \nanalyses.iii This careful, triangular cross-checking ensured consistency and will have reduced the \nlikelihood of error, but ultimately our analysis is an inherently subjective product of our collective \njudgement. (Moreover, all errors of interpretation are our own.) Once all the analyses had been completed \nsatisfactorily we collated the findings presented here. For ease of presentation we give only the \nfrequencies for each variable. Throughout, we compare our study with the findings and commentary from \nthese previous reviews. \n \nThe structure of the studies.  \nMuch the most common research design was the quantitative survey method. Despite Purcell\u2019s (1999) \ncall for more use of qualitative methods to examine this relationship, we found only a few wholly \nqualitative studies (e.g. Boxall and Steeneveld, 1999; Cheng and Brown, 1998; Gratton et al., 1999; \nSheppeck and Millitello, 2000), and even fewer that presented mixed-method results (e.g. Bacon and \nBlyton, 2001; Truss, 2001).  \n \nWe classified all articles by the primary level of analysis (see Appendix 2) because different aspects of \nboth HRM and performance are created, and operate, at different levels (e.g. teamworking takes place, by \ndefinition, at the group level, but HR planning takes place at the level of the organisation; job satisfaction \nis an individual-level measure, but profits and turnover apply at the organisational level). Thus, studies \nwould be expected to vary in design, depending upon the level of analysis. 62 studies were conducted at \nthe organisational level, 30 at the establishment level, and 17 at the individual level. We found just one \nindustry-level study (Bailey et al., 2001). We found seven explicitly multi-level studies (Bailey et al., \n2001; Gratton et al., 1999; Guest, 2001; Ramsay et al., 2000; Truss, 2001; Tsui et al., 1997; Whitener, \n2001). \n \nWe also recorded the identity of the respondent(s), noting concerns about the questionable reliability \nratings from using single-source respondents, whose perceptions are particularly prone to \u2018noise\u2019 and bias \n(Gerhart et al., 2000b; Ichniowski et al., 1996; Purcell, 1999). 63 articles used single raters, of which 26 \nused a single HR respondent, a matter of some consternation to Osterman (1994: 174) who expressed his \nscepticism about the level of awareness and impartiality of the typical HR manager as to her\/his \norganisation\u2019s people management processes (also found by West et al., 2002: 1307). 41 articles used \nmulti-raters (i.e. several respondents per unit of analysis from within a certain sub-population, such as \ndifferent managers \u2013 e.g. Batt, 1999). 32 articles used multi-actors (i.e. respondents from different sub-\npopulations per unit of analysis, such as a manager and an employee representative - e.g. Guest and \nPeccei, 2001). Gerhart and colleagues\u2019 recommendations (2000a) are at least four raters per unit of \nanalysis for HRM indicators, and at least three for performance indicators. Further, several authors \nrecommend selecting respondents according to the research question, hence overall HR effectiveness is \nbest appraised by senior Executives (Wright et al., 2001c), but the effectiveness of individual HR \npractices is best studied by asking the intended recipients, the employees (Paul and Anantharaman, 2003).   \n \nThe dominant theoretical framework(s): Table 1 on the website. \nIdentifying the theoretical framework used by authors for their research provides valuable information on \nthe epistemological and ontological assumptions they have about the subject that they bring with them to \ntheir research. These include how the subject is best conceptualised and defined; which relationships are \nimportant and worth studying, and how these may be explained in a generalisable sense, as well as what \noutcomes might be anticipated and hence tested. Moreover, authors\u2019 theoretical framework(s) might be \nexpected to require the selection of particular HR practices and performance outcomes, in keeping with \nany propositions derived from the framework.  \n 4\n \nDrawing on Wright and McMahan\u2019s (1992) anticipated list of likely theoretical frameworks, we tried to \nidentify for each article which theory seemed to inform the research. However, this proved far from \nobvious in many of the articles. Theoretical frameworks tended to be presented as part of a general \nrationale for the study, or they were deployed to explain the study\u2019s findings. We found very few studies \nthat had derived from a theory an explicit set of propositions, and then tested these in the research design. \nThis is an important distinction to bear in mind with our findings since, rather than confine this part of our \nanalysis to the handful of articles that tested a theory, we counted all significant mentions of theories in \nthe text (for a fuller discussion on the nature of theory in organisation and management research see \nBacharach, 1989; Sutton and Shaw, 1995).  \n \nGiven the multi-disciplinary nature of research into HRM an eclectic range of possible focal points for \ninterest, assumptions, conceptualisations, and analytical methods was to be expected. So we interpret as a \nwelcome trend the dominance of contingent frameworks (e.g. HRM in relation to the external \nenvironment, or to organisational strategy), and the resource-based view of the firm (cf. Barney, 1991; \nWright et al., 2001a). Indeed, in many authors\u2019 work there is an overlap between the two. Together, they \nreflect the central assumptions behind the (positive) conceptualisation of what HRM is and does: namely, \nthat it responds accurately and effectively to the organisation\u2019s environment and complements other \norganisational systems (cf. contingency theory) and that it delivers \u2018added value\u2019 through the strategic \ndevelopment of the organisation\u2019s rare, inimitable and non-substitutable internal resources, embodied \u2013 \nliterally \u2013 in its staff (cf. the resource-based view). Note that organisations\u2019 HRM practices are not \nconsidered strategic resources since they are easily copied (Wright et al., 1994: 318). Rather, it is the \nhuman and social capital held by the organisation\u2019s workforce that matters: \u2018The role that HR practices \nmay play is that of building the human capital pool and stimulating the kinds of human behaviour that \nactually constitute an advantage\u2019 (Boxall and Steeneveld, 1999: 445). With this in mind, the relatively \nmodest presence of employee-focused behavioural theories is a surprising finding, given the presumed \ncentrality to HRM\u2019s \u2018implicit theory\u2019 of employees\u2019 direct contribution to performance (Guest, 1997: \n268).  \n \nWe clustered the various interpretations of high-performance, or high-involvement, work systems \ntogether with the so-called \u2018AMO\u2019 theory proposed by Appelbaum et al (2000), and by Bailey et al \n(2001) in our sample, since the two are regularly conflated as offering a specific focus to a strategic HRM \nintervention (see Boxall and Purcell, 2003: 20). The essence of the two models is distilled in the basic \nequation of the latter:  \n \nPerformance = f (employees\u2019 Ability, Motivation, and Opportunity to participate). \n \nThe model argues that organisational interests are best served by an HR system that attends to employees\u2019 \ninterests, namely their skill requirements, motivations, and the quality of their job. A preliminary trend \nanalysis of citations for \u2018AMO\u2019 since its emergence in 2000 found 27 incidences (out of its total of 42), \nmore than any other theory during that period. We return to its potential for enhancing our theoretical \nunderstanding of HRM in our concluding remarks.  \n \nThough these three theories dominate the field, the contributions from less prevalent theoretical \nframeworks remain essential, both for the alternative perspective and insights they offer (e.g. population \necology, evolutionary economics, job characteristics theory) but also, in the case of new institutionalism \nso that studies are not conducted in an de-contextualised vacuum (see Boselie et al., 2003), and in the \ncases of stakeholder approaches and the labour process critique, so that issues related to HRM\u2019s \nlegitimacy and ethicality continue to be articulated and explored (Legge, 2005). Strikingly, we found no \nexamples of either transaction cost economics or of agency theory, both anticipated in Wright and \nMacMahan (1992). In the light of the late Sumantra Ghoshal\u2019s (2005) recent attack on the pernicious \neffects of both in business school teaching this too may be considered a welcome finding.   \n \nConcepts of human resource management: Table 2 on the website. \nFor each article we identified the policies, practices and interventions deemed to constitute \u2018HRM\u2019 in the \norganisations studied, and how this was operationalised and measured. For the most part, we found HRM \nunderstood as a set of \u2018employee management activities\u2019 and we focus on these studies in our analysis \n 5\nbelow. However, a few studies viewed HRM as an organisational \u2018orientation\u2019 toward managing \nemployees (e.g. Panayotopoulou et al., 2003), and several made an assessment of the effectiveness of the \nHR function (e.g. Huselid et al., 1997; Richard and Johnson, 2001; Teo, 2002; Wright et al., 2001c). \n \nStill no consensus has emerged on what employee management activities should be in a comprehensive \n\u2018HRM checklist\u2019, since no widely accepted theoretical rationale exists for selecting practices as \ndefinitively essential to HRM. Rather than attempt to construct our own list a priori (in the manner of \nPaauwe and Richardson, 1997, in Figure 1 \u2013 see also the list produced by Pfeffer, 1998), we allowed ours \nto emerge in an iterative process during our analysis of the 104 articles.  \n \nEmployee management activities can be sub-divided into practices, or techniques (Guest et al., 2004). For \nexample, selection (a \u2018practice\u2019) can involve psychometric testing, interviews, assessment centres, etc \n(techniques); contingent pay systems (a \u2018practice\u2019) can include profit-sharing, gainsharing, and \nperformance-related pay (techniques).  To avoid too great a variety, we opted for categorisation at the \n\u2018practices\u2019 level, which meant assigning particular HR techniques to one of our 26 general categories of \npractice (Appendix 2). As a consequence, the eclectic findings reported below mask an even richer \ndiversity of possible interpretations of HRM. That said, our particular definition of HRM, and our set of \npractice-level categories, mean that we depart from some authors\u2019 narrower definitions of HRM as having \nnothing to do with, for example job design, industrial relations frameworks or quality systems.   \n \nThe top four, in order, were training and development, contingent pay and reward schemes, performance \nmanagement (including appraisal), and careful recruitment and selection. These might be seen to reflect \nthe main objectives of most conceptualisations of a \u2018strategic\u2019 HRM programme (e.g. Batt, 2002: 587): \nnamely, to identify and recruit strong performers, provide them with the abilities and confidence to work \neffectively, monitor their progress toward the required performance targets, and reward them well for \nmeeting or exceeding them. Interestingly, some of the often-cited core elements of \u2018strategic\u2019 HRM that \nare also likely to be of benefit to employees seem to feature rather less in empirical research, notably good \npay, discretion over work tasks, employment security, diversity and work-life balance. Additionally, very \nfew studies examined practices associated with the \u2018exit\u2019 phase of the employment relationship (e.g. \nredundancy management). This remains a neglected area of HRM - perhaps because it is one of the \nsubject\u2019s, and the function\u2019s, \u2018darker\u2019 sides (Redman and Wilkinson, 2001).  In sum, the dominant \nimpression of authors\u2019 selections for HRM items is of a highly management-centric standpoint.  \n \nHR practices or HR systems? \nAn organisation\u2019s \u2018HRM\u2019 can be viewed as a collection of multiple, discrete practices with no explicit or \ndiscernible link between them, or the more strategically-minded system approach views HRM as an \nintegrated and coherent \u2018bundle\u2019 of mutually reinforcing practices. Research using the former approach \ntends to generate an index of possible HR practices, and investigates how many are used by the sample, \nwhile the \u2018systems\u2019 approach has researchers constructing \u2018clusters\u2019 of inter-related HR activities, and \nlinking this group as a synergistic whole to performance. We used the five methods described by Guest \nand colleagues (2004) to identify a systems approach, namely a straightforward measure of reliability \n(e.g. Cronbach\u2019s alpha), factor analysis (e.g. principal component analysis, or confirmatory analysis), \ncluster analysis, regression analysis with interaction variables, and sequential tree analysis. \n \n58 of the articles applied a \u2018practices\u2019 approach (e.g. Guest and Hoque, 1994; Huang, 1997). The \nremaining 46 articles explicitly corresponded to the systems approach (e.g. Ahmad and Schroeder, 2003; \nArthur, 1994; Delaney and Huselid, 1996; Koch and McGrath, 1996; Tsui et al., 1997). On this point, \nCappelli and Neumark (2001) made a point of pre-specifying their \u2018bundles\u2019 as a way of resisting the \ntemptation to mine the data post-hoc in search of bundles, with no theoretical justification for so linking \nthem (see too Van den Berg et al., 1999).  \n \nThe matter of which HR practices should be bundled together to form an HRM \u2018system\u2019 appears \nunresolved, as well (Lepak and Snell, 2002). No accepted theory exists that might classify different \npractices into \u2018obligatory\u2019 and \u2018optional\u2019, \u2018hygiene\u2019 factors and \u2018motivators\u2019. Cappelli (1995) makes this \npoint about the purpose of contingent pay: is it a \u2018control\u2019 or a \u2018motivator\u2019? Is job flexibility evidence of a \n\u2018utilitarian instrumentalist\u2019 approach, or a \u2018developmental humanist\u2019 HRM strategy, as with Delery and \nDoty\u2019s (1996) \u2018market\u2019 versus \u2018internal\u2019 models respectively? Nor is there agreement on whether those \n 6\norganisational practices designed to manage workplace conflict (e.g. due process and grievance \narrangements) are \u2018positive\u2019 HRM interventions in terms of ensuring procedural justice, or indications of \na kind of \u2018anti-HRM\u2019, \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 approach to managing employees. The very different focal points \nfor the different models further illustrate the malleability of the concept.iv As a consequence, no two \nsystems are identical (e.g. the eight-item lists produced by Delery and Doty, 1996, and by Ichniowski et \nal., 1997 share only four).  \n \nUntil consensus is achieved on conceptual matters, and perhaps even then, it would seem that HRM can \nconsist of whatever researchers wish, or perhaps what their samples and data sets, dictate. However, to \nour mind, this elasticity underscores the importance of researchers deriving their operationalisation of \nHRM from a theoretical framework \u2013 or at least acknowledging how and why their operationalisation \ntakes the form that it does (on this see Guest, 1997). The studies by Arthur (1994) and Bailey et al (2001) \nare good examples of HRM items specifically selected to reflect the central tenets of the authors\u2019 \ntheoretical framework.  \n \nMeasuring HR practices. \nIn measuring HRM, it is vital to distinguish between policies and practices (Wright and Boswell, 2002: \n263). The former is the organisation\u2019s stated intentions regarding its various \u2018employee management \nactivities\u2019, whereas the latter are the actual, functioning, observable activities, as experienced by \nemployees. As Van den Berg and colleagues note (1999: 302), \u2018an organisation may have an abundance \nof written policies concerning [HRM], and top management may even believe it is practised, but these \npolicies and beliefs are meaningless until the individual perceives them as something important to her or \nhis organisational well-being\u2019. Thus, researchers need to make sure that they do not confuse the two. \nMeasuring functioning HR practices, meanwhile, goes some way to addressing Legge\u2019s (2005) famous \njuxtaposition of HRM \u2018rhetoric\u2019 with organisational \u2018reality\u2019. \n \nAn HRM practice can be measured in three different ways: by its presence (i.e. a dichotomous scale for \nwhether it is actually in effect, \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019), by its coverage (i.e. a continuous scale for the proportion of \nthe workforce covered by it), or by its intensity (i.e. a continuous scale for the degree to which an \nindividual employee is exposed to the practice or policy). The overwhelming majority relied only on \nmeasures of presence. These are readily attainable and comparatively easy to analyse, but managers and \nemployee representatives often disagree considerably on the presence or otherwise of workplace \npractices, let alone their effectiveness (Ichniowski et al. 1996). Huselid\u2019s study (1995) and Guest et al \n(2003) are rare examples of use of coverage measures. We found rather fewer measures reflecting \nintensity, an exception being Truss (2001: 1135) who asked employees whether, for example, they \nreceived sufficient training to do their job. We found little attention paid to the quality of the \nimplementation of HRM as a necessary condition for its effectiveness. Although a handful of studies have \nnow examined the role of the HR function itself in terms of leadership and change delivery, the role of the \nimmediate line manager or supervisor in the actual enactment process (Purcell et al., 2003) is an \nunderdeveloped area.  \n \nConcepts of performance\/ outcomes: Table 3 on the website. \nGuest (1997) argues that it is more sensible to use the term \u2018outcomes\u2019 instead of \u2018performance\u2019 per se, as \nthe former reflects better the broad range of dependent variables used in studies. We draw a distinction, \nadapted from Dyer and Reeves (1995), between: \n1. Financial outcomes (e.g. profits; sales; market share; Tobin\u2019s q; GRATE) \n2. Organisational outcomes (e.g. output measures such as productivity; quality; efficiencies) \n3. HR-related outcomes (e.g. attitudinal and behavioural impacts among employees, such as \nsatisfaction, commitment, and intention to quit) \n \nA tacit recognition in many studies is that financial measures are the best indicators of organisational \nsuccess and sustainability, even the only indicators worth considering, given their value for company \nExecutives, shareholders and \u2018the market\u2019 (Ichniowski et al., 1996). We found financial measures in \nexactly half of the articles, with profits being the most common followed by various measures for sales.  \n \nGuest (1997) and several others have raised persuasive doubts about the problem of \u2018causal distance\u2019 \nbetween an HRM input and such outputs based on financial performance. Put simply, so many other \n 7\nvariables and \u2018events\u2019, both internal and external to organisations, can and do intervene that this direct \nlinkage rather strains credibility.v Use of more \u2018proximal\u2019 outcome indicators, particularly those over \nwhich the workforce might enjoy some influence, is both theoretically more plausible (given how HRM \nseeks to enhance employees\u2019 direct contribution to performance), and methodologically easier to link. Of \nthese organisational and HR-related outcomes, productivityvi proved the most popular outcome variable \noverall (e.g. Chang and Chen, 2002; Huselid, 1995; Ichniowski and Shaw, 1999; Kato and Morishima, \n2002). Another common output measure was product or service quality (e.g. MacDuffie, 1995; Jayaram \net al., 1999). A frustration is that there can be no uniform definition or standard measure of either \nproductivity or quality, since what constitutes either varies among different sectors. However, while some \ncommentators\u2019 dismay at being consequently unable to compare outcomes across studies is a valid \nobservation, it is also surely unresolveable. Looked at another way, the use of industry-specific dependent \nvariables provides researchers and practitioners alike with targeted outcome results for particular \nindustries.  \n \nA simple but important caveat should be attached to investigations into productivity and quality \nimprovements through HR investments in employees, which is that the improved outcomes may come at \nthe expense of an increase in unit labour costs, effectively canceling out the benefits gained (Cappelli and \nNeumark, 2001). It is prudent therefore for researchers to gauge the extent of this potential side-effect in \ntheir selection of measures. We found only a handful of studies other than Cappelli and Neumark\u2019s that \nexplicitly used the impact on unit labour costs as an outcome measure (e.g. Cooke, 1994; Guest, 2001). \n \nOddly, given how HRM\u2019s impact on performance is typically depicted as being refracted through changes \nin employee attitudes and behaviours, measures of employees\u2019 experience proved somewhat rare (26 in \ntotal). The most popular indicators were hard measures such as employee turnover or quit rates (e.g. Batt, \n2002; Huang, 1997; Shaw et al., 1998) and absenteeism (e.g. Lowe et al., 1997). Subjective attitudinal \nindicators included job satisfaction (e.g. Guest, 1999; Hoque, 1999), commitment (e.g. Tsui et al., 1997), \nand trust-in-management (e.g. Whitener, 2001). These are all positive employee outcomes, yet important \nstudies have looked into possible negative effects of HRM on employees. Ramsay and colleagues\u2019 study \n(2000) measured employees\u2019 stress levels and perceptions of work intensification. White et al (2003) \nexamined certain HR practices\u2019 impact on \u2018job-home spillover\u2019, a form of work-life balance. Godard \n(2001b: 789) found that moderate take-up of \u2018HRM-style\u2019 practices had positive outcomes for employees, \nbut intensive adoption heightened stress levels. MacDuffie (1995: 218) also acknowledged concerns that \n\u2018flexible production\u2019 equated to \u2018management by stress\u2019, but with no measure for the pace of work his \nstudy could not address the distinction directly. \n \nOutcomes from the perspective of stakeholders other than shareholders and managers proved rather less \nprevalent. In particular, given HRM\u2019s supposed business-driven focus, it was surprising to find outcomes \nfrom customers\u2019 point of view very much a minority concern, featuring in just two articles (Gelade and \nIvery, 2003; Rogg et al., 2001) \u2013 though this may be due to difficulties in securing access to such data. \nOther relevant stakeholders barely registered, particularly works council representatives and trade unions \n(exceptions include Bacon and Blyton, 2001; Guest and Peccei, 2001).  \n \nA final point on performance measures: very many of the studies had to rely on managers\u2019 perceptual \nestimates. Although Wall et al (2004) found that subjective self-reports compared favourably with \n\u2018objective\u2019vii measures in terms of reliability, the potential for social desirability bias (presenting one\u2019s \nemployer in a positive light) is nevertheless strong (see Gerhart et al., 2000b), while assessments asking \nfor a comparison relative to the organisation\u2019s rivals introduce yet more possibility of error. Objective \nperformance data, though more difficult to secure, is preferable to subjective judgement calls from \nrespondents. \n \nContingent\/control variables: Table 4 on the website. \nThe context within which organisations operate - both \u2018internal\u2019 and \u2018external\u2019 (Hendry and Pettigrew, \n1990) - holds critical information for researchers attempting to isolate the impact on performance of HRM \nspecifically, rather than other candidates. Without the careful incorporation into research designs of \npertinent contingency variables as moderators, and appropriate controls, authors may report results that \nmight either be explained away by the influence of these factors or, worse, may fail to hold once certain \nvariables are added to the analysis. In his overview, Wood (1999) further stresses the importance of \n 8\ncontingencies in terms of testing the importance of various HRM \u2018fits\u2019: with the organisation\u2019s \nenvironment, with its strategy, with its other systems, and internally as an HR system. Space does not \npermit a detailed breakdown of all of the controls and contingencies found in the 104 articles, since \nselections are in part dependent on the type of research being carried out, with the context and level of \nanalysis especially influential. We summarise here key findings to highlight candidates that might get \noverlooked.  \n \nControls serve to isolate the impact of the main independent variable (i.e. typically, though not always, in \nthese articles, \u2018HRM\u2019). Some research projects include certain controls by their very design (e.g. single-\ncountry studies effectively controlling for institutional frameworks and labour market pressures \u2013 e.g. \nNgo et al., 1998). Others must be built in. We found organisation size (typically defined by the number of \nemployees) and age used to offset the often-observed impact of economies of scale and HR experience \nenjoyed by large and established resource-rich firms. In this respect, size in particular does matter \n(controlled for in 64 studies); age less so (25 studies). \u2018Trade union influence\u2019 featured in 32 studies. We \nalso found the type of industry or sector controlled for in multiple-sector studies (e.g. Kalleberg and \nMoody, 1994; Chandler and McEvoy, 2000), while several single-industry studies controlled for intra-\nindustry segments (e.g. Appleyard and Brown, 2001; Batt, 2002) and highly specific variables reflecting \ndifferent sectors\u2019 idiosyncratic character, such as Sherer\u2019s (1995) study of US law firms controlling for \nthose based in New York City. As well as helping bolster methodological rigour, such details offer due \nsensitivity to context, which adds nuance and flavour to studies. Individual-level studies tended to control \nfor a standard range of appropriate personal characteristics such as age, gender, tenure, and educational \nattainment.  \n \nAs to contingency influences, 21 studies made explicit use of moderating interaction effects to test \nhypotheses about certain variables\u2019 impact on the relationship between the main independent and \ndependent variables. A striking finding for the notion of HRM as a strategic contribution is that only a \nfew articles used strategy as a moderator of the relationship between HRM and performance (e.g. Arthur, \n1994; Hoque, 1999; Huselid, 1995; Lee and Miller, 1999). That said, these relatively low figures may \nreflect the methodological difficulties of categorising accurately different business strategies (Wood, \n1999), of organisations\u2019 strategies changing over time (Ferris et al., 1999), and of prevailing typologies \n(cf. Schuler and Jackson, 1987; Miles and Snow, 1984) no longer being considered suitable.  \n \nLinking HRM and performance: Table 5 on the website. \nBetween the input (i.e. some form of HRM intervention) and output (i.e. some indicator of performance) - \nmoderated possibly by intervening variables (e.g. degree of institutionalism - Boselie et al., 2003) - lies \nwhat HRM does to improve performance, how, and why. This stage is popularly referred to as the \u2018black \nbox\u2019: so-called because we know little of what happens in this stage, and hence its contents remain \nsomewhat mysterious (see Wright and Gardner, 2003). Our analysis of the 104 articles confirms the \nimpression that the \u2018linking mechanisms\u2019 between HRM and performance (Wood, 1999: 408), and the \nmediating effects of key variables (Batt, 2002: 587), are largely disregarded. Indeed, while we found \nplenty of acknowledgements of the existence of the \u2018black box\u2019, and some speculation as to its possible \ncontents, few studies tried to look inside. It is surprisingly rare to find a detailed exposition of the \nconceptual model being used to link HRM with performance, still less a diagram. In most cases the \npossible content of the \u2018black box\u2019 has to be inferred from the brief descriptions of the research design, \nextrapolated from the methodology, or gleaned from the reported statistical analysis. To ascertain whether \na study dealt explicitly with the \u2018black box\u2019 we looked in the Tables of findings for the presence of \nidentifiable mediating effects, evidenced by such methods as stepwise analysis, structural equation \nmodelling and hierarchical linear modelling.  \n \nWe found 20 examples, including Ahmad and Schroeder (2003 - commitment); Gelade and Ivery (2003 \u2013 \nclimate); Park et al (2003 \u2013 increases in employees\u2019 skills and attitudes, and motivation); Rogg et al \n(2001 \u2013 climate); and van den Berg et al (1999 \u2013 morale and then employee involvement). Overall, then, \n\u2018black box\u2019 studies conceptualise employees\u2019 perceptions and experience as the primary mediating \nvariable, and the \u2018signalling\u2019 effects of HRM are understood to forge a psychological contract between \nthe employer and employees that shapes these perceptions and experience (Wright and Boswell, 2002: \n261; Ostroff and Bowen, 2000). We welcome this model as it has the merit of restoring to a central \nposition the effects that HRM has on an organisation\u2019s staff \u2013 something for which this predominantly \n 9\npositivist and functionalistic literature is often accused of neglecting. In other words, understanding how \nto secure a mutually benefical \u2018employee-organisation fit\u2019 is the enduring challenge for HRM researchers \nand practitioners alike (Boxall and Steeneveld, 1999: 460).  \n \nLimitations of this study \nThe first limitation is that this overview, while covering 104 major articles, cannot claim to be a definitive \nreview of every study published in this field between 1994 and 2003, given our self-imposed restrictions \non the sample. An associated limitation is that we had to stop our search at some stage at either end. A \nnumber of important articles pre-date our starting point (e.g. Krackhardt et al., 1981), and new articles \ncontinue to appear (e.g. the special edition of Industrial Relations, 2004: 43:1; Datta et al., 2005; Den \nHartog and Verburg, 2004).  \n \nSecondly, this study is necessarily descriptive by nature. The twin issues of which conceptualisations are \n\u2018best\u2019, and which research designs are \u2018more appropriate\u2019, are not resolved here - if such judgments can \nbe made, or even are desirable. However, we do suggest some implications of our findings in the section \nthat follows.  \n \nFinally, we have not had the space to address in sufficient detail the sceptical analyses of the HRM-\nperformance literature from scholars from the \u2018critical management\u2019\/ post-modernist tradition (e.g. \nLegge, 2005), though again we offer some brief comment in our conclusion.  \n \nDiscussion \nOur review of 104 major studies of the HRM-performance relationship reveals a number of hidden \nassumptions harboured by most conceptual models and much of the empirical research. As well as those \npertaining to the nature of each variable (discussed above), we would highlight the following concerns. \n \nThere are several issues surrounding causality. The common, though often only implicit, assumption in \nboth the theoretical and empirical literatures is of a relatively smooth sequential progress as depicted in \nFigure 2.  \n \nFigure 2. The standard causal model for the relationship between HRM and performance. \n \n     The unmediated HRM effect? \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \n \n                       Reversed causality \n \nHR \npractices \nHRM \noutcomes \n(Improved) \ninternal \nperformance \n(Improved)  financial \nperformance \nHR \nstrategy \nOverall \nstrategy \nThe first assumption in this model is that the organisation\u2019s strategic objectives either proscribe the HRM \ninput, or HRM is developed in response to these objectives. Either way, \u2018HRM\u2019 follows \u2018downstream\u2019 \nfrom the overall organisational strategy. Yet this sequence may not always hold true. Indeed, a genuinely \nstrategic HR function would expect to be involved in strategic decision-making, or at least to have \u2018HR\u2019 \nconsequences factored in to such decisions. The resource-based view even carries the strong suggestion \nthat HRM strategy be \u2018upstream\u2019 of the product market strategy (Wood, 1999: 376). Alas, little is \npresently known about the impact of HRM on strategic decision-making (see Golden and Ramanujam, \n1985; Harris and Ogbonna, 2001).  \n \nHRM interventions, derived from an HR strategy, are then understood to give rise to HRM-related \noutcomes, typically manifested in shifts in employee attitudes and behaviours (as with Figure 1). But as \nwe have seen, how this takes place - if, indeed, it does - remains somewhat neglected in empirical studies. \nWhat does seem clear is that the mere presence of such practices is unlikely to be sufficient. The quality \nof implementation \u2013 in terms of effectiveness, procedural justice, etc \u2013 is a vital determinant of the \n 10\nsuccess or otherwise of an organisation\u2019s HRM programme. Moreover, as Ramsay et al (2000), and the \nhandful of other studies documenting the negative consequences of HRM attest, some changes in \nemployees\u2019 attitudes and behaviours may not be what the HR strategy intended.  \n \nIn the model, \u2018better\u2019 employee attitudes and behaviours then contribute to delivering improved internal \nperformance (such as through increased productivity and quality). It may however be the case that HRM \ninfluences these organisational outcomes directly (the upper arrow in Figure 2), unmediated by any \nHRM-related outcomes. For example, interventions in training, job design and performance management \nmay improve employees\u2019 effectiveness - whether through simply removing task-related obstacles to better \nperformanceviii or through enhancing employees\u2019 technical knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) - while \nleaving their HRM-related attitudes and behaviours unchanged (such as motivation and intention to quit). \nThis illustrates the importance of a \u2018black box\u2019 mediating stage. Indeed, the elegance of the \u2018AMO\u2019 \ntheoretical framework is that it encompasses mediating changes in employees\u2019 abilities (A), motivations \n(M) and opportunities to participate (O). Motivation is the explicitly \u2018HR-related\u2019 mediator here; the other \ntwo may be considered \u2018direct\u2019 influences on performance.  \n \nFrom these organisational improvements stem firms\u2019 financial reward (e.g. higher sales and profits, \ngrowth and improved market value). One recognised problem in this respect is time-lag: the effect of an \nHRM intervention may not be fully realised for several years (Huselid and Becker, 1996; Kato and \nMorishima, 2002), and performance may even dip immediately following a change in HRM as the \norganisation adapts (see Pil and MacDuffie, 1996). Thus, studies measuring HRM and performance at the \nsame time-point are problematic. Indeed, most studies are cross-sectional and tend to offer merely \ncorrelations rather than causal inferences.  Addiitonally, most studies overlook the reverse causality \nexplanation (the bottom arrow), whereby any significant positive relationship between HRM and financial \nperformance may only be evidence of high-performing, resource-rich organisations proving more willing \nand able to invest in HRM than low-performing organisations (Hiltrop, 1999). Schneider and colleagues\u2019 \ncontroversial recent study (2003) has even extended the reverse causality thesis back to employees\u2019 \nattitudes. First, they found \u2018no consistent patterns\u2019 linking market and financial outcomes with either \nemployees\u2019 satisfaction with empowerment or job fulfilment, and they argue that these attitudes \u2018may be \ntoo far removed\u2019 from such ultimate outcomes for a direct link to be made (2003: 848). But the more \nimportant finding is that overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with [job] security appeared to be \u2018more \nstrongly caused by market and financial performance than the reverse\u2019 (2003: 845). In their conclusion \nthey criticise models featuring causal arrows stemming from employee attitudes to performance at the \norganisational level of analysis as \u2018at best too simplistic and at worse wrong\u2019 (op cit: 846). Longitudinal \nresearch designs might solve many of these problems \u2013 we found 15 examples in total, including Cappelli \nand Neumark (2001), and Pil and MacDuffie (1996) - but such designs can also be prone to larger \nmeasurement errors (Ichniowski et al., 1996). \n \nThese concerns lead us to reiterate our earlier scepticism about the methodological validity of isolating \nthe impact of an organisation\u2019s HRM from all the other variables that might part-determine financial \nsuccess. Moreover, recent corporate scandals (e.g. Enron and WorldCom in the United States; Marconi \nand Railtrack in the UK; Ahold in The Netherlands; Parmalat in Italy) ought to have engendered \nscepticism about the veracity of short-term financial performance measures as credible indicators of \norganisational success. Outcomes other than sales, profits and market value are important in the process \nof evaluating the ultimate need for almost all organisations, long-term sustainability (Boxall and Purcell, \n2003). Indeed, the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991) \u2013 found in almost a third of our sample \n\u2013 strongly implies the use of sustainability-oriented outcomes.  \n \nLegitimacy is another essential pre-requisite (Paauwe, 2004). Yet, as we have seen, the predominant \nshareholder approach tends not to acknowledge that other constituencies have a direct and often pressing \ninterest in the content of the organisation\u2019s HRM program and its overall performance, especially \nemployees. Taking a stakeholder approach (Freeman, 1985), such as the \u2018balanced scorecard\u2019 (Kaplan \nand Norton, 1992), necessitates a multi-dimensional research framework for HRM, with multiple actors \nrating multiple indicators of organisational sustainability. So, alongside managerial imperatives, measures \nfor employees\u2019 interests (e.g. good working conditions, job satisfaction, commitment, trust, etc); those of \ncustomers and suppliers (e.g. satisfaction with product and service quality), and - where present - trade \nunions (e.g. increased membership and procedural gains) would deepen studies. As Truss\u2019 study inside a \n 11\ndivision of Hewlett-Packard illustrates vividly, multiple outcome measures from multiple actors often \nproduce \u2018seemingly paradoxical and incompatible conclusions\u2019 (Truss, 2001: 1144). Addressing, rather \nthan ignoring, these contradictions is critical for our understanding of this complex relationship to evolve. \n \nHence, we would reiterate our earlier endorsement of more \u2018proximal\u2019 outcome indicators. We see \nproductivity and quality, acting in symbiosis, providing a mediating \u2018bridge\u2019 between the often labeled \n\u2018soft\u2019 HRM outcomes (e.g. employee satisfaction, commitment and trust) and \u2018hard\u2019 financial outcomes \n(e.g. sales, profits, ROI). This is important since, as Guest has argued (1997: 269), we should \u2018expect the \nimpact of HRM to become progressively weaker as other factors intervene\u2019. Regardless, if HRM is shown \nto make organisations produce goods or deliver services more effectively this is surely a valuable enough \nfinding, without then seeking tenuous direct links with financial performance. \n \nA final reason for focussing more explicitly on employee-derived outcomes comes from Lepak and \nSnell\u2019s \u2018HR architecture\u2019 model (1999). This strongly implies that an organisation\u2019s HRM system may \n(should?) vary according to the type of employee involved, implying a more targeted focus on those \nemployees whose unique capabilities add value, and are rare. That said, future research projects might \ndifferentiate between the HR practices implemented for these \u2018core\u2019 and those applied to \u2018peripheral\u2019 \nworkers, testing the outcomes for each.  \n \nImplications for Practitioners  \nEmpirical studies of HRM do seem to be consolidating attention on certain broad areas of policy (see \nTable 2), namely careful investment in recruitment and selection; provisions for training and employee \ndevelopment; flexible job designs (particularly in terms of de-centralised decision-making, teamworking \nand employee participation), performance management and appraisal, and appropriate payment systems \nincluding some form of incentive bonus component. These may be akin to Becker and Gerhart\u2019s core, \nuniversalistic \u2018HR principles\u2019 (1996: 786). However, each element is still \u2018contestable terrain\u2019 in the \nmanagerial pursuit of \u2018employee-organisation fit\u2019: performance management and individualised forms of \nPRP are particularly contentious policy domains, whose effects on employees are the subject of long-\nstanding controversy (see Townley et al., 2003, and Marsden and Richardson, 1994 respectively). \nAdditionally, in noting the popularity of these HR practices in research designs, we are certainly not \nadvocating the marginalisation of other practices, such as employment security, diversity and work-life \nbalance policies. Though they feature less frequently in research studies, these may have a significant \ninfluence on HRM\u2019s impact on performance. In other words, HR professionals, and other managers \nengaged directly in co-ordinating employees\u2019 efforts, need to reflect upon the totality of effects from their \nHR system, and should aim to shape all elements toward reconciling the \u2018employee-organisation\u2019 fit \nchallenge (i.e. internal \u2018fit\u2019). \n \nThe second point concerns the question of responsibility for ensuring the delivery of effective outcomes \nfrom HR interventions. The HR department might be responsible for the design and evaluation of \nemployee management policy and practices, but in many cases, and certainly many normative models of \nstrategic HRM, implementation is left to direct supervisors and front-line managers (Purcell et al., 2003). \nFor HR professionals, this means that the quality of what Boselie and Paauwe (forthcoming) call \u2018HR \ndelivery\u2019 is vital to success: aligning HR strategy with the overall business strategy (\u2018strategic \ncontribution\u2019), convincing line managers of the value of the organisation\u2019s HR practices (\u2018personal \ncredibility\u2019), and at the same time co-ordinating the implementation effectively (being an \u2018administrative \nexpert\u2019), including proper training, coaching and support for immediate line managers. At the same time, \nwe would stress to practitioners the importance of considering different stakeholders\u2019 interests in \norganisational strategic decision-making and the design of HR systems, particularly those of employees, \nlest what organisations intend for their workforce to experience fails to materialise (evidenced by those \nstudies reporting \u2018counter-productive\u2019 effects on employees). In an empirical study of changing HR roles, \nFrancis et al (2005) argue that in the pursuit of greater strategic influence, there is a risk that the \n\u2018employee champion\u2019 aspect of the HR role may become downgraded and employee well-being \nmarginalised (see too Caldwell, 2003; Renwick, 2003). Our analysis of 104 empirical studies has shown \nwhat a \u2018balanced scorecard\u2019 perspective for the design of HRM can offer. This might be called the \n\u2018indirect\u2019 shareholder approach where, in order to satisfy the needs of the owners, the organisation sets \nout to satisfy the needs of its employees and customers, as well. Such a re-orientation would also restore \nto HRM the spirit of Beer and colleagues\u2019 original model (1984). \n 12\n \nConclusion \nThe primary objective of this paper was to see whether there might be commonalities and widely \naccepted trends in the theoretical perspectives, conceptualisations and methodologies used in the field of \nHRM and performance research. Details of our findings are summarised in each of the sections above.  \n \nA steady body of empirical evidence has been accumulated since the pioneering studies in the mid-1990s, \nyet it remains the case that no consistent picture exists on what HRM is, or even what it is supposed to do. \nKeenoy (1999, cited in Harley and Hardy, 2004) may be reassured that its precise nature, even in the \noverwhelmingly positivistic research reviewed here, is still contested.  \n \nAs for its much-vaunted impact on performance, in much - by no means all - of the empirical research \nHRM in its 'system' form have been found to \u2018matter\u2019 (in a positive sense) for organisational performance \n(Ichniowski et al., 1996; Guest, 1997). However, because of the sheer variety of methods used for \nmeasuring HRM, performance, and the relationship between these two, it is not possible to compare \nresults from different studies. What can be concluded definitively from this collection of studies is still \nunclear. Moreover, all findings come with serious caveats attached and concessions concerning \nmethodological limitations, whether because potentially decisive variables have been omitted, or causality \ncannot properly be inferred, most studies being cross-sectional and confined to correlations (see Wood, \n1999). The disparity of research designs, and enduring uncertainties, suggest that we - still - need Guest\u2019s \nthree theories (1997): for HRM, for performance and for the linking stages between the two.  \n \nTo this end, we would venture the following propositions on theoretical clarity. We found in our analysis \nthat authors are increasingly blending insights from the \u2018Big Three\u2019 theories \u2013 contingency, the resource-\nbased view and \u2018AMO\u2019 \u2013 into a formative overall theory of HRM. Bae and Lawler (2000) and Huselid \n(1995) cite all three; Batt (2002) draws upon AMO & RBV. The three do seem to offer complementary \nframeworks: AMO\u2019s attention to employee\u2019s skills, motivations and opportunities to participate acts as a \ntheory for HRM; RBV has as its fundamental starting point a belief in the value of employees' input into \nperformance (i.e. that their input is potentially decisive), while contingency approaches offer a lens on the \npossible link between these two, emphasising in particular the vital importance of examining the impact \nof contextual factors from the external environment. Organisational strategy is an obvious candidate here. \nBut greater attention to context also points to researchers needing to be more sensitive to insights drawn \nfrom new institutionalism theory (cf. DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Boselie et al., 2003; Legge, 2005). \nHowever, as we have seen, these theories have not been \u2018translated\u2019 into a consensus with regard to the \noperationalisations of the key variables. They remain only a starting point. \n \nThese theories are not the full answer to Guest\u2019s quest (1997). We agree with Wright and Boswell (2002) \nthat researchers now need to extend the field\u2019s theoretical development beyond these dominant \u2018macro\u2019 \napproaches to accommodate insights from OB-type \u2018micro\u2019 theories (e.g. expectancy theory, goal setting \ntheory) and hence to explore in much greater depth employee\u2019s actual experience of HRM. Here, \n\u2018climate\u2019 suggests itself as a potentially useful \u2018black box\u2019 (Ostroff and Bowen, 2000). This anticipates \nthe growing use of multi-level methods, which have been advocated powerfully as a method for truly \nunderstanding the nature of organisations (Klein and Koslowski, 2000), and the impact of HRM in \nparticular (Ostroff and Bowen, 2000). These would match employee-level antecedents with \norganisational-level outcomes (\u2018micro\u2019 with \u2018macro\u2019). As we have argued throughout this paper, this \nwould also restore employees\u2019 experience of work to the heart of HRM research and practice.  \n \nDuring the course of this review we recognised ourselves in Ferris et al.\u2019s self-description (1998: 236): \n\u2018simultaneously excited and troubled, frustrated yet optimistic, and encouraged but cautious\u2019. The \u2018Holy \nGrail\u2019 of decisive proof remains elusive, ten years on. It is hoped that, by summarising the \nconceptualisations and operationalisations of the different variables in the existing empirical literature, \nthis paper might help break through the dispersion of research approaches, settle on commonalities and \n\u2018best practice\u2019, and inaugurate a fresh agenda for optimal research designs for the future. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the editor and the two anonymous reviewers, as well as Tom Redman, for \ninsightful and constructive criticisms of earlier versions of this paper. \n 13\nREFERENCES (* denotes that the study was included in the analysis.) \n \n*Addison, J. and Belfield, C.R.

These include the absence of \nemployment security, diversity and work-life balance in the \u2018HR activities\u2019 \u2013 though these absences may be \nindicative of changing agendas in HRM since these issues entered the popular consciousness fully after 1997. Other \nomissions are organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) from the \u2018HRM outcomes\u2019 box, and \u2018strategy\u2019 from the \ncontrols\/ contingency variables. Yet to adapt this diagram ourselves we would have compounded the enduring \nproblem in the literature of authors adding new dimensions and content, with little or no theoretical justification for \nso doing\u2026 \n \nii Briefly summarising each, Ichniowski and colleagues give a broad overview covering articles from 1990-1996 in \nwhich they discuss familiar terrain to reviews of this kind: the nature of \u2018workplace innovations\u2019 (i.e. HRM for our \npurposes), different methodological design issues (e.g. type of study, variables for inclusion, measurement \nchallenges), the nature of HRM \u2018bundles\u2019, and some evidence as to performance. Guest\u2019s own overview, mainly \ncovering articles from 1994-1996, examines the theoretical foundations of the research, and deals expansively with \nthe notion of \u2018fit\u2019: external, internal and configurational. He too discusses issues surrounding measurement of both \nHRM and performance. Wood\u2019s analysis is purposefully confined to 15 specially selected empirical papers from \n1994-1999 that focused on HR systems, and four different hypotheses on the HRM-performance link: the general \nrelationship between HRM systems and performance, and its moderation by strategy, lean production, and by \nHRM\u2019s integration with the overall organisation. Finally, most recent is Wright and Boswell\u2019s review, which \nfocuses on articles published between 1998-2000, but extends on occasion before and after. They blend both \nmethodological and conceptual concerns to categorise their selected papers according to a 2x2 typology of four \ndifferent types of research, based on level of analysis (individual vs organisational) and the number of HR practices \nmeasured (single vs multiple). They then review recent studies in each quadrant, and offer several excellent \nrecommendations for future research designs. \n \niii For example, should West et al\u2019s (2002) use of hospital death rates as a performance indicator be classified under \n\u2018quality\u2019, or under \u2018customer satisfaction\u2019 (reverse-coded)? \n \niv In models in which HRM is understood as \u2018human resource management\u2019, the implied focus is exclusively on \n\u2018management\u2019 processes, and management interventions (i.e. as a means of coordinating tasks and people more \nefficiently). However, alternative models see HRM as \u2018high-involvement work practices\u2019, with a focus on involving \nemployees more effectively in organisational decision-making. Still other models understand HRM as \u2018high-\ncommitment management\u2019, with its core objective being to generate among employees a psychological bond to the \norganization. Finally, there are models whose advocates concentrate on \u2018performance\u2019, in which HRM is \nunderstood as a set of \u2018high-performance work practices\u2019 offering a means of delivering better outcomes. For \nadditional commentary on this see Wood (1999). \n \nv Within organisations, variables such as the use of new technology or production methods, marketing campaigns, \nmergers and acquisitions, public relations catastrophes, short-term calculative moves to boost share price, etc, will \nall contribute. From beyond the organisation, there are almost innumerable possible influences, often wholly \nunrelated to the organisation itself, such as the price of oil, random market fluctuations generated by the whims and \nherd-like behaviours of investors, changes to legislation, even global political conflict (witness the aftermath of \nSeptember 11th for most major airlines). \n \nvi A \u2018pure\u2019 productivity measure should only capture some measure of output (e.g. units produced) per effort exerted \n(e.g. employee working hours), or number of employees. However, we found in several studies a \u2018productivity\u2019 \nmeasure referring to sales (as in \u2018sales per employee\u2019). This is problematic since sales levels are affected by non-\nproduction factors such as price, marketing and logistics. These are instead implicit financial outcome measures. \nHowever, the \u2018sales per employee\u2019 variant was probably used because of data availability. \n \nvii Of course, apparently objective publicly available measures, such as on turnover, may only be indirect and \nsubjective data provided by someone within the participating organisation. \n \nviii Herzberg\u2019s (1968) famous motivation experiments were criticised for overlooking this explanation. \n \n 26\n"}
