INTRODUCTION \nThere has been a downward trend in satellite design and \nmanufacture over the last few years. This is a reverse from \nthe mid space history, where after the heydays of Apollo, \ntimescales went only up. In the early days of space \ndevelopment, late 1950s and early 1960s, there were no \nstandards, and as time was the only yardstick to measure \nprogress by, scientific and engineering development \nspacecraft were built and launched in quick succession. \nSpace development ended up going to larger and costlier \nspacecraft, with increasingly longer timescales and higher \ncost. For commercial telecommunications missions, that can \nbe planned and executed over long timescales, this is no \nproblem. There have been developments to shorten the \ntimescales of development of satellite missions, and every \nonce in a while there is some proud statement announcing \nthat a certain satellite has been designed and readied for \nlaunch in only eighteen months. It is easy, however, to \nimagine a mission that would be able to take advantage of a \nmission design-and-build period of only a few days. This \napproach would allow investigation of newly discovered \nphenomena, or would allow observation satellites to \nrespond quickly to developing military or natural situations. \nInstead of having to reply on the standard LandSat type \nimagery, one can quickly configure an imager for the \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The imager can then be \nlaunched into an orbit that is optimized for the required \nviewing, including local weather patterns, for instance late \nafternoon Sun-synchronous.  \nA typical spacecraft launcher integration campaign will take \nat least a month from shipping the satellite to the launch site \nto separation in orbit, and this section of the mission must \nbe reduced as much as the satellite design, build and test \ntime. Apart from technical issues that must be solved, the \nprocess requires buy-in from customers and launch \nproviders. \nAn initial design [1] study had led to the initial development \nof a satellite bus, which was then further developed for a \nspecific mission proposal that came along shortly \nafterwards. The outcome of the mission design was a \nversatile platform well suited to the mission turnaround \nrequired for quick missions. The UK TOPSat mission has \nsince used a derivative of this platform, and the RapidEye \nconstellation is about to use it for five spacecraft. \n2. SPACE ACCESS TRANSFORMATION \nMany mission ideas never go beyond the back of the \nenvelope, or the end-user\u2019s desk, because the timescales \ninvolved would not allow the mission to be completed, or \neven started in orbit, before the subject of the mission is no \nlonger available, or before the information would be out of \ndate, or otherwise of no use anymore. If one could imagine \na mission that could be in orbit within a day, not only could \nnew missions be thought up, but satellites could be kept \nready on the ground to quickly increase capacity or modify \ncapability when required. This approach would obviate the \nneed for large in-orbit capability that ties up capital and \noperational cost. \nThe space launch industry has developed from a joint \nmissile history, but whereas missiles can be launched in an \ninstance with little or no final preparation required, orbital \nlaunchers require lengthy procedures to be completed \nbefore every launch. With the timescales involved in typical \nspace missions, there is no need for launches to happen \nquicker than at present: as long as the rocket preparation \ntime is shorter than what is required for the satellite \ndevelopment there is no pressure. \nThere are therefore two prongs to the development of a \nspace capability that allows true quick response: the \ndevelopment of a satellite that can be configured in a very \nshort time, and the development of a quick-response \nlauncher, either a new one or a different way of treating and \nprocessing current launchers to make them respond to \nopportunities faster. \n3. SPLITTING THE PROBLEM \nSpace missions start as two separate problems: the \nspacecraft and the launch vehicle. At some point they \nbecome interlinked, through various mechanical, electrical, \nand other interfaces. Coupled-loads analysis is performed to \nensure that the combined structure will not exhibit any \nundesirable vibration characteristics, and any changes on \neither side must be carefully controlled. The satellite will go \nthrough a fit-check exercise long before launch to ensure \nthat there will be no integration problems at the launch site. \nIf a satellite can be designed with fixed mechanical \nparameters, it could be pre-qualified, and no coupled-loads \nanalysis would have to take place for every mission. There \nwould be no need for a fit-check meeting either. The launch \nagency could manufacture and provide the spacecraft half of \nthe separation system, with all cables already attached, \nensuring that the spacecraft integrates to the launcher \nwithout any possibility of a mismatch. \nLauncher standardization \nNot many launch vehicles are in current use, especially \ncompared to the number of different spacecraft that have \nbeen launched. Changing a launch vehicle or designing a \nnew one is a long and expensive process; therefore it is \nlikely that it would be simpler to assess what launchers are \navailable, and use that information as the starting point for \nspacecraft platform design. \nSatellite standardization \nTo provide for a standard spacecraft, either both platform \nand payload must always be the same, or the platform must \nbe able to compensate for any differences between \npayloads. Clearly the latter will make it simpler for payload \ndevelopment, but it requires ingenuity and larger margins \nfor the platform design. \nThis spacecraft standardization can be compared with a \ntypical desktop PC. Whatever the actual hardware that is \nselected at the point of purchase; whether a larger hard disk, \nmore memory or a faster processor: the box will remain the \nsame size, it will fit in the same spot that the previous PC \noccupied on the desk, and it will plug into the same mains \noutlet. There is no need for the office layout manager to \ntake the actual specification of the computers into account \nwhen buying desks. \nOne of the critical design inputs here is directed \noptimization: look at standards rather than optimize for size. \nThe same could apply to satellites: rather than try to shave \noff every last gram of mass and shrink every subsystem into \nthe smallest volume, make the satellite standard and cheap. \nThis will make it simpler to reuse, as unused margins may \nwell come in handy when a satellite platform is used for the \nnext-generation avionics. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS \nA satellite platform for standardized space access will have \nto be carefully designed for reconfigurability, ease of \nassembly and test, and ease of launcher integration. \nFew, if any, of the current platforms in use result in truly \nstandard satellites across missions. Obviously, in the case of \nmissions like Iridium, all satellites are the same, but that is \nnot the same as having a satellite supporting different \npayloads in different orbits without having to completely \nrequalify the entire technical path from design to orbital \noperations. \nThe platform must be able to accept a ready-built payload \nwith a minimum number of integration steps, with simple \nand inspectable interfaces. This means that the bolted joints \nand connectors have to be external in easy accessible places, \neven if this means a heavier or larger design. It also needs \nquickly reconfigurable attitude sensors and actuators, and \nwith a thermal and power system that can cope with any \norbital inclination and hour angle. \nThe payload accommodation can be clearly defined, so it \nwould be easy for designers to have units ready, or very \nquickly design or modify a payload for the mission. The \ncurrent interface specification includes a dual CAN bus for \ncommand and housekeeping telemetry, switched power at \n28 V, and LVDS serial data link. The structure includes a \nnumber of standard mounting points, each having four M4 \nthreaded holes in a 100 mm square configuration. Individual \nsensors and antennas can either be directly compatible, or \nuse an interface plate. The CAN-bus and the 100mm-square \nmounting were used successfully in the past on the UoSAT-\n12 satellite, where it allowed the system qualification to \nprogress independent from the design of individual \nsubsystems. \nPre-manufacturing \nTypical lead times for space components is many months, \nso the satellite must consist of pre-manufactured elements \nthat can be assembled without requiring lengthy procedures \nor tests. A selection of basic satellite parts can be kept in \nstorage ready to be assembled quickly when required. With \nsuch interchangeable parts it may be possible to define open \nstandards to allow third-party developments to be included. \nThe subsystems may be cheaper to make as they do not \nhave to be individually optimized for each mission and this \nmay offset the investment required for the manufacture of \ncomponents that may not be used for a while. \n5. DESIGN EXCERCISE \nSea-surface radar mission \nThat mission calls for a number of spacecraft for regular \nworldwide measurement of the state of the sea surface. The \nconstellation of satellites covers the entire Earth, meaning \nthey will be operating in different thermal and sunlight \nenvironments. When optimizing the system for Sea \ncoverage, the best orbit turned out not to be polar, but \nslightly lower at 72 degrees. This produced the best \ncoverage of shipping lanes. It is of course a non-Sun-\nsynchronous orbit, and meaning that the Sun hour angle \nchanges continually for each individual satellite, requiring a \nspacecraft design that is insensitive to the thermal and \npower issues related to this.  \n \nMission Requirements \nThe satellite design\u2019s main requirements were to provide a \n1-metre-diameter nadir pointing dish antenna, 50 W of \norbit-average power, and all Sun angle power generation. \nThe satellite needs some on-board propulsion to acquire and \nmaintain position in the constellation. Each spacecraft \nshould also be cheap to build and launch, as the \nconstellation would consist of 16 satellites, and it was \nplanned for a commercial business need, which placed strict \nfinancial limits on the program. \nCost and volume restrictions meant that there was no option \nof providing full redundancy for every subsystem; however, \nthe constellation will have to keep working for a seven-year \nperiod minimum to meet the business plan. The propellant \nusage, battery life, radiation degradation of solar panels and \nother predictable lifetime effects can be taken into account \nby suitable sizing of the designs, but random failures are \nmore difficult to cope with. This reliability required some \ncreative strategies to be developed for dealing with various \nfailure scenarios. \nSatellite design \nInitially the satellite was to be based on an existing \nplatform, as that was deemed the cheapest solution, \napparently requiring little design work. The selected \nplatform was a 100-kg, 50-cm square by 80-cm tall cuboid, \nwith a gravity-gradient boom for attitude control and solar \npanels on four sides.  \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on March 17,2010 at 10:26:47 EDT from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n 4\n \n \nThis design looked fine until the various system budgets \nwere calculated. There was not enough power to support the \npayload, and the antenna was too small to maintain the link \nrequired to detect the return signal from the sea surface. It \ndid not have propulsion, and the cost modifications needed \nto meet even the basic requirements would be prohibitive, if \nat all possible. The platform design was subsequently \ndiscarded for this mission. \nA new and creative design was going to be needed to meet \nthe requirements, and this time the electrical power for the \nmission and the payload antenna size were going to be \naddressed first. \n \nThe solar panels were canted out at 30 degrees, which \nprovided more solar cell area, as filling out of the corners \nincreased the panels in size. The new angle increases the \npower that is generated from the Sun per surface area on top \nof that, as they are more efficiently pointing at the Sun, \nkeeping the Earth out of their field of view.  \n \nThe graph shows the relatively even power generation \nduring the Sunlit portion of one orbit. \nThis new layout also provides a 1-metre square Nadir facing \nfacet to mount the antenna on, allowing the inclusion of a \nsuitable dish or phased-array antenna. \nThe internal volume increased significantly: this allows an \neasy layout of the avionics, payload modules, propulsion \nand harness, easy access for assembly and test, and simple \nadjustment options for center-of-gravity adjustments. \nAttitude control \nThe spacecraft initially had a gravity-gradient boom for \nattitude control. With the magnetorquers this would provide \nabout 1 degree of pointing accuracy, not enough for this \nmission, so it was replaced by a pitch momentum wheel. \nThis wheel represents a serious single-point failure mode, \nso a second wheel is added to the satellite. In order to \nprovide additional redundancy in the solar panels, the \nsecond wheel is mounted with its spin axis 90 degrees \nrotated from the first one. If the first wheel fails, the \nspacecraft can be rotated 90 degrees, and the mission can \nproceed as before. If a solar panels fails, the spacecraft can \nbe rotated and run of whichever wheel is required to keep \nthe particular panel out of sunlight, thereby providing full \npower to the spacecraft again, and without having to include \noversize or additional solar panels. As orbits precess, the \norientation can be changed every few months as required to \nkeep the mission fully functional  \nFor attitude measurement the satellite has three horizon \nsensors on board, with their operational axis 120 degrees \napart. \nOrbit control \nThe internal design of the structure allows a simple interface \nto the propulsion system. As the propulsion is used for \norbital corrections only, and not for attitude control, only a \nsingle thruster is needed. This thruster can be directed \nstraight up through the attach fitting. If a station keeping \nmaneuver is required, the spacecraft simply performs a 90-\ndegree pitch, burns the engine for a while, and returns to \nnormal attitude a few seconds later. \n \nThis layout does not only allow the pitch maneuver to be \nperformed by either wheel, but it also keeps the firing \ndirection through the spacecraft\u2019s center of gravity as the \ntank depletes. As this satellite monitors the oceans, it can \nperform the maneuver over land, without affecting the \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

For other payloads appropriate portions of the orbit \nor operational schedule can usually be found, for instance at \nthe night side of the orbit. \nThe propulsion system can be integrated at the launch site, \nallowing the pre-integrated tank, valves and thrusters to be \nassembled elsewhere, and it can be pre-filled away from the \nspacecraft. It can be replaced with different systems to \nprovide for different mission requirements at a late stage \ntoo, for instance to cope with a late change of launch \nvehicle, or orbital requirements, or if a secondary launch \nopportunity into a non-optimal orbit suddenly becomes \navailable. \n \nAs the diagrams above show, a range of systems can be \nprovided without any change to the spacecraft. The only \nphysical interface consists of a few electrical connectors and \na few bolts. \nMany constellations do not require individual satellite \norbital slot keeping, rather they require that the satellites be \nkept a certain distance from one another. This means that if \nthe propulsion system of one satellite fails, the rest of the \nsatellites in the constellation can be maneuvered to keep up \nwith the failed one to keep the mission fully operational. \nThe propulsion system is a specific system that by virtue of \nits size is difficult to duplicate, and having a duplicate \nsystem would require both being larger than the original one \nin order to cope with having to move the additional mass of \nthe second system. It does however have multiple failure \nmodes, as it has moving parts and flowing gasses in it, with \nchanging stresses after launch due to pressure changes. \nThe internal structure of the satellite consists of two crossed \nstructural aluminum honeycomb sheets. For ease of \nintegration this structure is built up from one main member, \nand two half members that connect to it.  \n \nThe spacecraft avionics other than orientation-sensitive \nattitude sensors and actuators are mounted only on the main \nsheet. The advantage of this mounting is that the satellite \ncan be assembled and partially tested in a flat-sheet mode, \nwith easy access to all units, and taking very little space \nwhile in the cleanroom. See the difference floor space \nrequired between 1-metre square satellites and the single \npanels mounted two per stand. \n \nThe assembled sheets can be stored in a very small space, \nwhich allows a number of satellites to be assembled \nconcurrently in a fairly small facility. It is only at the final \nstage of assembly that the two cross members are attached \nand that the payload frame is attached to the top of the \nframes. The launch vehicle attach frame is mounted to the \nbottom of the cross-frame, and four solar panels fill out the \ncomplete structure. This final assembly could be completed \nat the launch site, leading to substantially lower shipping \ncosts. \nBy keeping all payload components on the large top plate, it \nis possible to assemble those plates separately, possibly at \nthe payload provider\u2019s facility. Attitude sensors and \nactuators are also mounted on this plate, allowing them to \nbe appropriate to the payload rather than to the bus, and any \nalignment and calibration can be accomplished as an \nintegrated unit. The direct physical connection between the \npayload and the attitude subsystem makes for an \nintrinsically stable design that is most likely to withstand \nlaunch vibration without introducing errors through shift or \nrotation. A selection of plates can be held ready for any \npayloads to be mounted on. The payload plate includes a \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on March 17,2010 at 10:26:47 EDT from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n 6\nseries of standard mounting interfaces. The use of such \nstandard interfaces allows the manufacture of the plates to \nbe independent of the development of payload units, and of \nplatform units such as antennas and sensors. \nThe individual parts of the structure, including mounted \navionics, payloads, and other subsystems, will have been \ntested for compliance with their design requirements, which \nmeans that the final assembly can be done just before \nlaunch and not require additional vibration testing. The \nstructural risk of not subjecting the final satellite to a \ncomplete vibration test is similar to that of the final \nassembly of the satellite to the launcher, the assembly of the \nrocket stages, and the mounting of the fairing. None of these \ntypical launcher assembly tasks are verified by vibration, \nyet they are acceptable for launch. \n6. FURTHER USE \nThe bus design as shown above has been proposed for \nseveral missions, and derivatives of it have been launched. \nThey did not use all the quick-modification possibilities, but \none of them, TOPSAT, launched just recently in late 2005, \nwas able to use a different orbit than initially planned for \nand it perform its mission. \nMany other missions have been proposed, showing the \nversatility of the design. \n \nAbove are versions for optical Earth observation, \natmospheric sounding using GPS signals, and a horizon-\nscanning payload. Below various radar antennas, and ocean \ncolor analyzer and a dual hyperspectral imager. \n \n7. LAUNCH \nThe satellite layout allows them to be efficiently packed into \na cylindrical volume. This layout allows for instance 8 such \nspacecraft to be launched on a single Dnepr launcher, as \nshown in the sketch below. With a selection of payloads, the \ncost can be shared amongst many customers, and the \nlauncher can be pre-booked without knowing the details \nabout the payloads to be included. With a typical launch \ncapability of three tons to Low Earth Orbit, there is enough \nmass margin for a strong central tube to carry the eight 100-\nkg spacecraft, even allowing the spacecraft to grow to 150 \nor 200 kg with a heavy payload. \n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The plates can be selected from a \npre-manufactured set, or a late-breaking payload can be \nquickly added to an existing blank panel for final-moment \ninstallation on the satellite body. The whole assembly of \ncentral column with assembled spacecraft can then be \nmounted on the Dnepr, as per usual operation for this \nvehicle, and launched quickly thereafter. The dual payload \nfloor of the Dnepr can be used to provide two individual \nsets of spacecraft for different customers. \n \n8. CONCLUSION \nThe Constella platform design developed at SSTL has a \nnumber of features that allow it to be pre-manufactured and \ntested, ready for last-minute customization and quick \nlaunch. The design makes for inherent cost savings in both \nthe satellite itself and the required facilities while providing \noperational redundancy and compatibility with any low \nEarth orbit. The availability of this platform will enable a \nvery quick response mission that can take advantage of new \ntechnology, or to investigate a new cosmic or Earth-bound \nphenomenon that may be changing or disappearing. \nTraditional satellites, and even current so called quick \nturnaround missions that still take a year or more could not \ncontemplate such missions and simply changing procedures \nto speed things up will not make the fundamental step \nincreases in performance that this design offers. \n9.
