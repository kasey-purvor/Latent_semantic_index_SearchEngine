Introduction \nThe unique characteristics of lasers provides them with the capability for the non-contact processing \nof materials which are otherwise difficult to process. Concrete is one such material since it is a \ncomposite, consisting of an array of fine and coarse aggregate pieces embedded within an ordinary \nPortland cement (OPC) matrix. Consequently the processing and surface treatment of concrete can be \na difficult undertaking. This present work describes the use of high power diode laser (HPDL) \nradiation to enhance the wettability characteristics of the \u2018as-cast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete and the \neffects thereof on the characteristics of a subsequently HPDL fired enamel glaze. The value of such \nan investigation would be to elucidate the reasons behind the successful generation of a durable and \nlong-lasting surface seal on the OPC surface of the concrete, which has been shown by Lawrence and \nLi to be viable means of extending the life and applications base of the concrete [1]. It is a distinct \npossibility that such developments may yield significant economic benefits. \nThe laser processing of concrete is a field of ongoing research, with many studies having been carried \nout to investigate the technique itself and the associated phenomena. Most of the research, however, \nhas concentrated on the laser cutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using high power CO2 \nlasers, most prominently with regard to nuclear reactor decommissioning [2-4]. Also, as part of \nnuclear plant decommissioning, Li et al. [5-8] conducted research to determine the workability of \nseveral laser techniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete surfaces. Such \ntechniques experimented with were: direct glazing of the concrete, single and multiple layer fusion \ncladding and combined chemical\/fusion cladding. Work by Sugimoto et al. [9] focused upon \nmodifying the surface appearance and surface properties of cement based materials using a high \npower CO2 laser. The laser treatment produced novel surfaces, with surface textures, properties and \nappearance unique to laser treatment. The resultant physical characteristics and mechanical behaviour \nof the post-process cement based materials was later fully characterised by Wignarajah et al. [10]. \nBorodina et al. [11] has carried out investigations into the structural changes within the composition \nof zirconia concrete caused by surface exposure to CO2 laser radiation, detailing microstructural \nchanges, phase changes and the absorptivity characteristics. In all of these studies, spallation and \nexcessive cracking and porosity formation were found to be major problems undermining the \nperformance of the laser treated surface layer. However, Lawrence and Li [12-15] have treated the \nOPC surface of concrete with both CO2 and HPDLs. The HPDL generated OPC glaze was shown to \n 4 \nbe more than an effective surface modification insofar as it provided superior mechanical, physical \nand chemical characteristics over an untreated or CO2 laser treated OPC surface. \nTo date, very little published work exists pertaining to the use of lasers for altering the surface \nproperties of materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. Notwithstanding this, it is \nrecognised within the currently published work that laser irradiation of a metal surface can bring \nabout changes in the metal\u2019s wettability characteristics. Previously Zhou et al. [16, 17] carried out \nwork on the laser coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on \nthe well documented fact that generated oxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting. Further, \nHeitz et al. [18], Henari et al. [19] and Olfert et al. [20] have found that excimer laser treatment of \nmetals results in improved coating adhesion. The improvements in adhesion were attributed to the \nfact that the excimer laser treatment resulted in a smoother surface and as such enhanced the action of \nwetting. Yet the reasons for these changes with regard to changes in the material\u2019s surface \nmorphology, surface composition and surface energy are not reported. However, in a number of more \ncomprehensive investigations by Lawrence et al., which compared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, \nexcimer and HPDL radiation on the wettability characteristics of a mild steel [21, 22] and a \nSiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic material [23] it was found that changes in the wettability characteristics of \nthe steel varied depending upon the laser type. Furthermore, Lawrence et al. have conducted \nnumerous studies to investigate the feasibility and characteristics of laser enamelling ceramic \nmaterials [24-27] and steels [28, 29]. \n2. Theoretical background \n2.1. Contact angle and wettability \nWhen a drop of liquid is placed on a solid surface it may remain as a spherical drop, or spread to \ncover (wet) the solid surface [30]. The angle with which the liquid subtends the solid is known as the \ncontact angle. In practice, for wetting to occur the contact angle is less than 90\n0\n. If the contact angle \nis greater than 90\n0\n then the liquid does not wet the solid and no adhesion occurs [30]. Once irradiated \nby the HPDL beam the enamel powder melts, transforming to a liquid phase. As such, the process of \nthe bonding of the enamel to the HPDL treated OPC substrate is determined by the wettability of the \ntwo component parts. When a drop of liquid is brought into contact with a flat solid surface, the final \nshape taken by the drop, and thus whether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative \n 5 \nmagnitudes of the molecular forces that exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between  the liquid and \nthe solid (adhesive) [30]. The index of this effect is the contact angle, \u03b8, which the liquid subtends \nwith the solid. \u03b8 is related to the solid and liquid surface energies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and the solid-liquid \ninterfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the principle of virtual work expressed by the rearranged Young\u2019s \nequation: \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (1) \nClearly, to achieve wetting \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a \nlower surface tension will always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to \nreduce the total free-energy of the system [31]. This is due to fact that the molecular adhesion \nbetween solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion between the molecules of the liquid [30]. \nThe adhesion energy of a liquid to a solid surface (the work of adhesion) Wad, is given by the Young-\nDupre equation: \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (2) \nIt is important to consider also the influence of the substrate surface roughness on the wetting contact \nangle. Rough grooves on a surface, which may contribute to the influence of contact angles, can be \ncategorised as either radial or circular grooves. Any practical rough surface can be represented by a \ncombination of these two cases [32]. In fact two roughness parameters can be defined: the Wenzel \ntype, DR [33] and the Cassie\/Baxter type, FR [34]. In the case that wetting spreads radially, as is the \nlikely case with the OPC surface of concrete, then the resulting radial contact angle, \u03b8rad, is related to \nthe theoretical contact angle, \u03b8th, by \n ( )cos cos\u03b8 \u03b8rad R R th RD F F= \u2212 \u22121  (3) \nAccording to Neumann [35], only if FR is equal to zero, then a model similar to that for heterogeneous \nsolid surfaces can be developed in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by \nWenzel\u2019s equation: \n ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (4) \n 6 \nwhere r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is the \ncontact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s treatment is \nonly effective at the position of wetting triple line [32]. Nevertheless, it is clear from Eq. (4) that the \ninfluence of surface roughness on the contact angle is to cause an increase in the contact angle. Thus, \nthe smoother the contact surface is, then the smaller the contact angle will be. \n2.2. Surface energy and the polar\/dispersive characteristics \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [36]. The majority of \nthese forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total \nsurface energy comprises of \u03b3\np\n (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3\nd\n (dispersive component; \nsince van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their chemical nature). Therefore, \nthe surface energy of any system can be described by [36] \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (5) \nSimilarly, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface [36]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (6) \nBy equating Eq. (6) with Eq. (2), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to the \nsurface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (7) \n3. Experimental procedures \n3.1. Materials \nThe concrete studied in the experiments was the ubiquitous OPC based concrete. For the purpose of \nexperimental convenience the as-received concrete blocks were sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x \n 7 \n20 mm\n3\n) prior to HPDL treatment. The composition by volume of the concrete is as follows: 20 mm \nlimestone aggregate (40%), 10 mm limestone aggregate (14%), zone M sand (28.5%), OPC (10.5%) \nand particulate fine aggregate (7%). In order to obtain results of a practical and useful nature, the area \nof the concrete irradiated during the experiments was the naturally occurring \u2018as cast\u2019 OPC surface of \nconcrete. In this case the OPC surface of the concrete had a thickness of 2.5 mm. The composition by \nvolume of the OPC is as follows: CaO (63.9%), SiO2 (21.9%), Al2O3 (5.7%), Fe2O3 (2.8%), SO3 \n(2.7%), MgO (2.2%), K2O (0.7%) and Na2O (0.1%).  \nThe enamel used was a commercially available enamel frit (Ferro Group) which, in order to form a \nmanageable paste, was mixed with 20wt% white spirit. The composition of the enamel consisted \nmainly of the following: SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn and small quantities of Pb, Ba, MgO, Al2O3 and Ni, \nwhilst the powder size was less than 25 \u00b5m medium size. \n3.2. Laser processing procedure \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed, Inc.), emitting at 810\u00b120 nm and \noperating in the continuous wave (CW) mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-120 W. The \nHPDL beam was delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical \nfibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-\naxis CNC gantry table. The concrete sample blocks and the enamel frit were irradiated using the \ndefocused high order mode HPDL beam with a beam spot diameter of 2-5 mm and laser powers \n(measured at the workpiece using a Power Wizard power meter) of 20-100 W. The defocused HPDL \nbeam was fired across the surfaces of the concrete samples by traversing the samples beneath the \nbeam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from 60-600 mm min\n-1\n. The \nlaser optics were protected by means of a coaxially blown O2 shield gas jet a rate of 5 l min\n-1\n.  \n3.3. Wetting and surface energy analysis procedures \nIn order to analyse the HPDL treated specimens, they were sectioned with a Struers cutting machine \nusing a diamond rimmed cutting blade, and then polished using cloths and diamond suspension pastes \ndown to 3 \u00b5m. The sectioned samples were then examined using optical microscopy, scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) \ntechniques and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). \n 8 \nTo examine the wetting and surface energy characteristics of the HPDL treated OPC surface two sets \nof wetting experiments were conducted. The first set of experiments were to simply determine the \ncontact angle between the enamel and the OPC surface before and after HPDL treatment. The second \nset of experiments were control experiments carried out using a variety of liquids with known surface \nenergy properties in order to quantify any surface energy changes in the OPC surface resulting from \nHPDL irradiation. \nThe enamel-HPDL treated OPC surface wetting experiments were carried out in atmospheric \nconditions with molten droplets of the enamel (600\n0\nC). The temperature of the enamel throughout the \nexperiments was measured using a Cyclops infrared pyrometer. The droplets were released in a \ncontrolled manner onto the surface of the OPC surface (treated and untreated) from the tip of a \nmicropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being approximately 15 x 10\n-3\n cm\n3\n. Profile \nphotographs of the sessile enamel drop were obtained for every 60\n0\nC fall in temperature of the molten \nenamel drop, with the contact angle subsequently being measured. \nThe control experiments were carried out using: human blood, human blood plasma, glycerol and            \n4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as well as the dispersive (\u03b3 lv\nd\n) \nand polar (\u03b3 lv\np\n) components, are detailed in Table 1. The experiments were conducted in atmospheric \nconditions at a temperature of 20\n0\nC with the temperature of the liquids themselves throughout the \nexperiments also being maintained at 20\n0\nC. The droplets were released in a controlled manner onto \nthe surface of the test substrate materials (treated and untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with \nthe resultant volume of the drops being approximately 6 x 10\n-3\n cm\n3\n. Each experiment lasted for three \nminutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops being obtained every minute, with the contact \nangle subsequently being measured. \n4. Effects of high power diode laser radiation on ordinary Portland cement \nThe typical surface morphology of the glaze generated on the OPC surface of concrete when using \nthe HPDL is shown in Fig. 1. As is evident from Fig. 1, crack and porosity formation were common \nfeatures of the HPDL glaze.  \nThe complex chemistry of the OPC surface of concrete and the hydration of its various constituents \nare a complex issue. Nonetheless, it is known that the constituents of OPC are minerals which exist \n 9 \nas multi-component solid solution chemical compounds. Of particular importance with regards this \nstudy, OPC contains in relatively large proportions a number of basic glass network formers and \nmodifiers: SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3. Consequently the intense local heating brought about by the \nincident HPDL beam results in melting of these compounds at around 1283\n0\nC, thereby causing the \nmaterials to lose the retained water and form an amorphous glassy material consisting of various \ncalcium-silicate-alumina compounds [4]. Furthermore, the fracture section of the HPDL glaze \ngenerated on the OPC surface of concrete is shown in Fig. 2. As one can see from Fig. 2, the \nmicrostructure of the HPDL generated glaze has no discernible structure and appears to be fully \namorphous. Indeed, the amorphous nature of this glaze was verified by XRD analysis results shown \nin Fig. 3. \nIn addition, distinct changes in the colour of the OPC surface were observed after HPDL treatment. \nTypically the OPC surface changed colour from grey to green. These changes are due to the resultant \nphase transitions and also, the presence in small concentrations of metal transition ions in various \noxidation states within the OPC composition, in particular, ferric ions in the Fe\n3+\n and Fe\n2+\n oxidation \nstate. Fe\n3+\n and Fe\n2+\n ions are known to give rise to green and blue colours respectively when subjected \nto intense heating [37, 38]. However, if both phases are present within the composition, then the \ncolour is determined by the Fe\n3+\n\/Fe\n2+\n ion ratio, resulting in dark blue or black colours [37, 38]. Since \nthe surface produced after HPDL treatment was green, then it is reasonable to assume that both \nphases were not present within the OPC. \nPetzold et al. [39] have determined from differential thermal analysis (DTA) results that up to \napproximately 420\n0\nC, OPC remains relatively stable. Notwithstanding this, some dehydration does \noccur and water is also lost from the pores of the cement. This is, however, far outweighed by the \ndehydration of Ca(OH)2 which follows shortly after 420\n0\nC is exceeded in accordance with \n  Ca(OH)2 \u2192 CaO+H2O  (8) \nFurthermore, the dehydration of the Ca(OH)2 promotes the development of microcracks which begin \ninitially around the Ca(OH)2 [40]. Moreover, this dehydration results in unslaked lime (CaO), which \nis effectively the generated HAZ; since the temperature of the surface of the OPC during interaction \nwith the HPDL during glazing was measured to be well in excess of 420\n0\nC. This generated CaO HAZ \nwas observed located either below the glazed surface layer or around the edges of the glazes. Indeed, \nby using a phenolphthalein indicator followed by water misting, it was possible to clearly discern the \n 10 \nHAZ around the HPDL treated zone on the OPC surface of the concrete, since phenolphthalein is an \nindicator which is colourless in CaO, turning violet-red in the presence of Ca(OH)2 due to the change \nin pH. \n5. High power diode laser fired enamel glaze characteristics \nIt was observed that, prior to HPDL irradiation, it was not possible to fire the enamel onto the OPC \nsurface of concrete. Indeed, HPDL interaction with the enamel when placed on the untreated OPC \nsurface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the enamel (the formation of small spheres approximately \nthe diameter of the laser beam itself). Such observations are in accord with those of Bourell et al. [41] \nand Agarwala et al. [42], who noted the balling phenomena during laser sintering work of silica based \nmaterials. After HPDL surface treatment of the OPC surface, however, it was possible to fire the \nenamel directly onto the OPC surface. The mechanism of this phenomena is based entirely on the \nwettability characteristics of the OPC surface.  \nThe typical surface morphology of the HPDL fired enamel glaze produced on the HPDL treated OPC \nsurface of concrete is shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from Fig. 4, neither crack nor porosity \nformation were discernible on the enamel glaze. An XRD analysis of the HPDL fired enamel glaze \nrevealed it to be fully amorphous. \nThe typical cross-sectional view of the HPDL fired enamel glaze produced on the HPDL treated OPC \nsurface of concrete is shown in Fig. 5. As one can see from Fig. 5, the enamel glaze appears to be \nwell bonded to the HPDL treated OPC surface of concrete. \n6. Wettability and surface energy characteristics \n6.1 Contact angle and wettability \nAs was mentioned earlier, it proved impossible to fire the enamel glaze directly onto the OPC surface \nwithout prior HPDL treatment. An optical micrograph of a sessile drop of enamel (200C) placed on \nthe surface of the OPC before (a) and after (b) HPDL irradiation with the contact angle superimposed \nis shown in Fig. 6. The experimental results showed that throughout the period of cooling of the \nenamel, from the molten state at 6000C to the solid state at room temperature, no discernible change \nin the magnitude of the of the contact angle took place during the time of the experiments. This \n 11 \nindicates that thermodynamic equilibrium was established at the solid-liquid interface at the outset of \nthe experiment [43]. Fig. 6 shows clearly that prior to HPDL treatment it was not possible to fire the \nenamel onto the surface of the OPC since the contact angle was measured as 1090, and as such would \nprevent the enamel from wetting the OPC surface.  \nOne explanation for the fact that HPDL treatment of the OPC is necessary so that the enamel \ncompletely wets and adheres to the surface is that the surface resulting from the HPDL treatment is \nsomewhat smoother, with an Ra value of 2.88 \u00b5m compared with 21.91 \u00b5m, and, according to Eq. \n(4), will intrinsically effect a reduction in the contact angle. Also, wetting will have certainly been \ninfluenced by the increase in the O2 content of the OPC surface as a result of the HPDL treatment, \nsince this is known to increase the likelihood of wetting [43, 44]. Wetting is governed by the first \natomic layers of the surface of a material. Thus, in order to determine element content of O2 at the \nsurface of the OPC, it was necessary to examine the surface using XPS analysis. A difference in the \nsurface O2 content of the OPC before and after HPDL treatment was observed, increasing from an \ninitial value of 44.7at.% to 49.2at%.  \n6.2. Ordinary Portland cement surface energy and its dispersive\/polar character \nIn accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [36] and Agathopoulos [43], it is possible to \nestimate reasonably accurately the dispersive component of the OPC surface energy,\u03b3 sv\nd\n, by plotting \nthe graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv in accordance with Eq. (7) [36], with the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n being \nestimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the \nintercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the \nabscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1. Fig. 7 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv for the untreated and \nHPDL treated OPC-experimental control liquids system.  \nComparing the ordinate intercept points of the untreated and HPDL treated OPC-liquid systems, it \ncan be seen clearly from Fig. 7 that for the untreated OPC-liquid systems the best-fit straight line \nintercepts the ordinate closer to the origin. This indicates that, in principle, dispersion forces act \nmainly at the OPC-liquid interfaces resulting in poor adhesion [36, 47]. In contrast, Fig. 7 shows that \nthe best-fit straight line for the HPDL treated OPC-liquid systems intercepts the ordinate considerably \nhigher above the origin. This is indicative of the action of polar forces across the interface, in \naddition to dispersion forces, hence improved wettability and adhesion is promoted [36, 46]. \n 12 \nAgain, in accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [36] and Agathopoulos et al. [43], it is not \npossible to determine the value of the polar component of the OPC\u2019s surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n directly \nfrom Fig. 7. This is because the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) is at \n( )2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3sv\np\nlv\np\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and not the control liquid system. \nHowever, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface energies due to dispersion \nforces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability performance [36, 47]. Thus it is \npossible to calculate the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n from Eq. (6). The results \nreveal that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and HPDL treated \nOPC surfaces, Wad  can be correlated with Wad\nd\n by the relationship \n W aW bad ad\nd= +  (9) \nwhere a and b are constants unique to each control liquid system. Also, for the control test liquids \nused, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar components of the control test liquids \nsurface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n  ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n13 115\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (10) \nBy introducing Eq. (9) into Eq. (6) and rearranging, then \n  ( )W a W bad\np\nad\nd= \u2212 +1  (11) \nBy introducing Eq. (10) into Eq. (11) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, then the following \ncan be derived: \n  ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (12) \nFrom a plot of Eq. (9), a can be determined for the untreated and HPDL treated OPC (1.3 and 1.6 \nrespectively). Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the untreated and HPDL treated OPC from \nFig. 7, then it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and HPDL treated OPC using Eq. (12). \n 13 \nTable 2 details the values determined for \u03b3 sv\nd\n and \u03b3 sv\np\n for both the untreated and HPDL treated OPC. \nClearly the HPDL treatment of the surface of the OPC leads to a reduction in the total surface energy \n\u03b3sv, whilst increasing the polar component of the surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n, thus improving the action of \nwetting and adhesion. Such changes in the surface energy of the OPC after HPDL treatment are due \nto the fact that HPDL treatment of the surface of the OPC results in partial vitrification of the surface; \na transition that is known to effect a reduction in  \u03b3sv  and an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n [43]. \nIt is important to note that because of the long range ionic interactions in the OPC and the composite \nnature of the interfaces between the OPC and the liquids, it is highly likely that the \nthermodynamically defined total solid surface energy, \u03b3, as defined in Eq. (5), will be higher than the \nsum of the dispersive, \u03b3\nd\n, and the polar, \u03b3\np\n, components of the surface energy. Although the increase \nin (excess) surface free energy will probably be less then the increase in the total lattice energy. On \nthe other hand an absorbed liquid layer may shield the ionic fields substantially. As such, all the data \nderived from Eq. (6) - (7) and Eq. (9) - (12) should be considered as being semi-empirical. \nNevertheless, as the studies by Gutowski et al. [48] and Agathopoulos et al. [43] found, it is \nreasonable to conclude from the data obtained from Eq. (6) - (7) and Eq. (9) - (12) that HPDL \ntreatment of the OPC surface has effected an increase in \u03b3\np\n. \n7. Conclusions \nContact angle measurements revealed that, because of the wettability characteristics of the OPC, \nHPDL surface treatment was necessary in order to allow the enamel to wet and adhere to the OPC \nsurface. As such, the HPDL treatment of the OPC surface resulted in the contact angle decreasing \nfrom 1090 to 310. Wetting, and the subsequent bonding, of the enamel to the OPC surface after HPDL \ntreatment was identified as being due to: \n1. The HPDL vitrification of the OPC surface reducing the surface roughness from an Ra value \nof 21.91 \u00b5m before HPDL treatment, to 2.88 \u00b5m after HPDL treatment, thus directly \nreducing the contact angle \u03b8. \n2. The increase in the polar component of the surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, (3.46 mJm-2 to 15.56 mJm-2) \nafter HPDL treatment as a result of the laser vitrification of the glass forming elements \nwithin the OPC composition, thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. \n 14 \n3. The increase in the surface O2 content of the OPC from 44.7at% to 49.2at% resulting from \nHPDL treatment was identified as further promoting the action of wetting. \nThis work demonstrates that it is possible to alter the wetting characteristics of the OPC using the \nHPDL to facilitate the firing of a vitreous enamel onto the OPC surface, an achievement not possible \nwithout HPDL treatment. But, moreover, the findings of this work show that with the use of laser \nradiation it is a distinct possibility that the wetting characteristics of many other materials could be \naltered. \n 15 \nReferences \n1.
