The role of\ntriaxial deformation is discussed, in particular in a description of the observed two I\u03c0 = 8+ states.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.72.057304 PACS number(s): 21.60.\u2212n, 21.10.Re, 27.30.+t\n24\n12Mg has been well studied as a typical case of a well-\ndeformed light-mass nuclear system. After self-consistent mi-\ncroscopic calculations of the nonrelativistic [1] and relativistic\nmethods [2] in the late 1980s, the nucleus is believed to\nhave an axially symmetric and prolate shape in the ground\nstate. Assuming the core of 16O, the ground-state configura-\ntion is supposed to have eight valence particles occupying\nthe d5\/2 orbits (four neutrons and four protons). Because\nthe Fermi level of this nucleus is in the beginning of the\nsd shell (corresponding to the N = 2 harmonic-oscillator\nshell), there are many open valence orbitals above the Fermi\nlevel, which may induce deformation and consequently a\ncollective rotation. Such a rotational band has been already\nidentified in experiments (for instance, see Refs. [3,4]). A\nparticular interest is the existence of the two I\u03c0 = 8+ states\nobserved in experiment. These two states are energetically\nclose to each other (the difference is about 2 MeV). After\nthe study of Sheline et al. [5], it is believed that the second\n8+ belongs to the ground-state rotational band (g band). Valor\net al. analyzed the g band with the cranked Skyrme HF + BCS\napproach as well as the configuration mixing approach based\non the generator coordinate method (GCM) [6]. However,\ntheir calculations assume axial symmetry for descriptions of\nintrinsic states. Up to I\u03c0 = 4+, they were able to reproduce\nthe experimental data very well. The cranked mean-field\ncalculation gave a fairly good agreement for I\u03c0 = 6+, while\nthe configuration mixing approaches returned larger energies\nfor the state. This is simply because these states at high spin\nwere projected out from the noncranked mean-field state.\nInterestingly, the cranked mean-field calculation for I\u03c0 = 8+\nmatches the observed energy of the first 8+ state, but the\nauthors dismissed the agreement on the basis of the analysis\nof Sheline et al. [5], and they speculated that the disagreement\nmight mainly come from the triaxial effects at high spin\ninduced by the disappearance of the pairing correlation in\ntheir calculation.\nInspired by the study by Valor et al. [6], I performed the self-\nconsistent cranking calculation, allowing triaxial deformation\nin a self-consistent manner. As a new aspect in my study,\nnot only 1D-cranking but also 3D-cranking calculations were\ncarried out. An advantage of the 3D-cranking model is that\nlow- and high-K intrinsic structures can be systematically\nstudied [7].\nThe Hamiltonian used in my study reads\n\u02c6H = \u02c6H0 + \u02c6V , (1)\nwhere the first term describes the one-body part, which\nis the spherical Nilsson Hamiltonian in this study, and\nthe second part is the two-body interaction, which is the\npairing-plus-quadrupole force (the so-called P+QQ force).\nThe model space (valence space) to diagonalize the two-body\npart contains two major shells (N = 2, 3) in the spherical\nNilsson model, in accordance with the Kummar-Baranger\ncriteria for the P+QQ force [8]. The variational state is the\nHF-Bogoliubov (HFB) ansatz, which is a generalized product\nstate. With quasiparticle annihilation operators \u03b2q , the ansatz\nis expressed as\n|HFB\u3009 =\n\u220f\nq\n\u03b2q |0\u3009, (2)\nwhere |0\u3009 is the vacuum for the canonical bases am and a\u2020m.\n(In my case, the canonical basis corresponds to the spherical\nNilsson basis.) The canonical basis and the quasiparticle basis\nare connected by a unitary transformation called the general\nBogoliubov transformation [9]. The variational equation is\nderived for\n\u03b4\u3008HFB| \u02c6H \u2212\n3\u2211\ni=1\n(\u03c9i \u02c6Ji + \u00b5i \u02c6Bi) \u2212\n\u2211\n\u03c4=p,n\n\u03bb\u03c4 \u02c6N\u03c4 |HFB\u3009 = 0. (3)\nIn the above equation, \u02c6Ji is the ith component of the\nangular-momentum operator (the index i takes i = 1, 2, 3),\nand \u02c6N\u03c4 describes the number operator for protons (\u03c4 = p)\nand neutrons (\u03c4 = n). \u02c6Bi is an off-diagonal component of the\nquadrupole operator, defined as\n\u02c6Bi = 12 ( \u02c6Qjk + \u02c6Qkj ), (4)\nwhere the indices (i, j, k) should be placed in a cyclic\nmanner. Each term with the Lagrange multipliers (\u03c9i, \u00b5i , and\n\u03bb\u03c4 ) is necessary to put constraints in intrinsic states: (\u3008 \u02c6J1\u3009,\n\u3008 \u02c6J2\u3009, \u3008 \u02c6J3\u3009) = (J cos\u03b8,J sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, J sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6); \u3008 \u02c6N\u03c4 \u3009 = N\u03c4 ;\n\u3008 \u02c6Bi\u3009 = 0. The last constraint is necessary so as to keep\nthe orientation of the angular-momentum vector against the\nintrinsic coordinate axes [9]. The variational equation is\nsolved by means of the method of steepest descent. Details of\nthe method are presented in Ref. [9]. A deformed Nilsson +\nBCS state is used for an initial trial state at J = 0.\nDeformation parameters and gap energies for the trial state\nare determined by reference to the calculations of the\nliquid-drop model by the Mo\u00a8ller et al. [10]. In the present\nstudy, the deformation parameters for the ground state are\nchosen to be (\u03b2, \u03b3 ) = (0.347, 0.0\u25e6) and the pairing gap\n0556-2813\/2005\/72(5)\/057304(4)\/$23.00 057304-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 72, 057304 (2005)\nTABLE I.

Despite the use of a simple separable interaction,\nthe ground-state rotational spectra are reproduced reasonably\nwell (Fig. 1). As Valor et al. commented in Ref. [6], the\ngap energies disappear for both protons and neutrons before\nJ = 6h\u00af (Fig.1). Triaxial deformation gradually decreases from\n\u03b3 = 0\u25e6. However, in J \u0001 4h\u00af, triaxial deformation can still be\nregarded as negligible. In other words, axial symmetry is\nkept fairly well and large (see Table I). On the other hand,\nat high spin (J = 8, 10h\u00af), substantial triaxial deformation is\nformed (\u03b3 >\u223c \u221210\u25e6), and axial symmetry is clearly broken. It\nshould be noted here that the convention for the quadrupole\ndeformation parameters (\u03b2, \u03b3 ) in this study follows the Hill-\nWheeler coordinates, which give the opposite sign in \u03b3 to\nthe so-called Lund convention.

Energy surface of the J = 8h\u00af state, calculated by means\nof the 3D-cranked HFB method. There are two minima as intrinsic\nstates, which are seen at (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (0\u25e6, 0\u25e6) and = (90\u25e6, 0\u25e6).\nwhere \u03c1 is the density matrix and ji is the single-particle\nangular-momentum operator. The indices m and n are for\nthe canonical bases, and the index i is for the coordinate\naxes, that is, i = 1, 2, 3. Using this information of angular\nmomentum, we can discuss a nuclear structure with single-\nparticle spins. Table II gives the calculated main components\nof single-particle spins for different total spins J. The result\nreflects a fact that 24Mg is a N = Z nucleus, that is, the ways\nof single-particle excitations are the same for both protons and\nneutrons. For low-spin members in the rotational band, the\ntotal spin consists mainly of d5\/2. The higher the total spin, the\nmore the d3\/2 orbit is occupied. Therefore the \u201ccollectivity\u201d\nin this nucleus is attributed to gradual excitations into the\nd3\/2 orbit.\nNext, the results of the 3D-cranking calculations are\npresented. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of the\nJ\u03c0 = 8+ state, in which its triaxial deformation becomes\nsubstantial (\u03b3 \u0005 \u221210\u25e6) in the 1D-cranking calculation.\nObviously from Fig. 2, two configurations compete with\neach other. This competition can be considered as a kind\nof \u201clevel crossing\u201d between two different states (or config-\nurations), but in the 3D-cranking calculation each \u201clevel\u201d\nis represented by a curved surface. There are mainly two\nminima in the energy surface for the J = 8h\u00af state (Fig.2):\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (0\u25e6, 0\u25e6) and = (90\u25e6, 0\u25e6), and they characterize the\ntwo configurations. The former minimum corresponds to the\n1D-cranking solution in which triaxiality is calculated to be\n\u03b3 \u0005 \u221210\u25e6. The rotation axis is found to be along the shortest\naxis, and the corresponding state is expected be of low-K\ncharacter. The latter minimum is the energetically lowest state\n(yrast state) at this spin, which is about 2.5 MeV lower than\nthe 1D-cranking solution. This yrast state at J\u03c0 = 8+ is found\nto be axially symmetric because the triaxiality is calculated to\nbe \u03b3 \u0005 0\u25e6 (\u03b2 \u0005 0.24).

As a result, the\nmajor components of the state should be of high-K characters.\nStudying in detail the microscopic structure, we find the total\nspin to be constructed almost purely by the d5\/2 orbits (in\nboth protons and neutrons): 3.97h\u00af each by the d5\/2 orbits\nof protons and neutrons. In addition to the difference in the\ndeformation, a lack of the d3\/2 component in the first 8+ state\nimplies that the yrast state is surely different from rotational\nmembers of the g band from a microscopic point of view. The\nshell-model calculation by Wiedenhover et al. [4] says that\nsuch a configuration, that is, (d5\/2)8, corresponds to the first\n8+ state (which does not belong to the g band) observed in\nexperiment. Therefore my result is consistent with that of the\nshell-model calculation too.\nFrom this result, we can conclude that the yrast state found\nin our calculation at J = 8h\u00af is a high-K state with K\u03c0 = 8+.\nIt was experimentally observed to be energetically lower than\nthe second 8+ state by about 2 MeV.\nIn the right-hand panel of Fig. 3, the triaxial deformation\nis seen to have \u03b3 \u0005 120\u25e6 at 20\u25e6 <\u223c \u03b8 <\u223c 45\u25e6. Because the level\ncrossing happens at \u03b8 \u0005 20\u25e6, we cannot exactly see how the\ngraph continues toward \u03b8 \u2192 0. However, from the trend of the\ngraph, it is possible to guess that the graph forms a symmetric\nshape with respect to \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 in the left-hand panel of\nFig. 3, and that \u03b3 \u2192 120\u25e6 for \u03b8 \u2192 0\u25e6 in the right-hand panel\nof Fig. 3. This reflection symmetry around \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 indicates\nthat the state in 0\u25e6 \u0001 \u03b8 \u0001 45\u25e6 and the state in 45\u25e6 \u0001 \u03b8 \u0001 90\u25e6\nhave the same intrinsic structure. (The calculated \u03b2 values are\nshown in Table III.)\nThe ground-state rotational band was studied with the\nself-consistent 1D-cranking calculation. It was confirmed\nin this study that an effect of triaxiality on the nature of\nthe rotational band is important at high spin, as previously\nanticipated by Valor et al. In addition, two high-spin states\nat J = 8+ observed in experiment were analyzed by means\nof the self-consistent 3D-cranking calculation. It concludes\n(in a qualitative manner) that the yrast 8+ state is an axially\nsymmetric high-K state created by the deformation-aligned\nprotons and neutrons in the d5\/2 orbitals whereas the second\nTABLE III.
