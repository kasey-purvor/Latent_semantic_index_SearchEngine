This paper explores the nature and extent of\nairline fuel hedging and asks why airlines hedge. A policy of permanent hedging of\nfuel costs should leave expected long-run profits unchanged. If it damps out profit\nvolatility, it should do so in a way that the market would not value. However, it may\nnot damp out volatility, after all. Oil prices and air travel demand cycles are linked\nwhen oil supply reductions drive GDP declines. But oil and travel are negatively\ncorrelated when GDP demand surges drive oil price increases. So oil prices can\neither increase or decrease airline profit cycles, depending on the time period\nsampled. A fuel price hedge would create exceptional value when an airline is on the\nedge of bankruptcy. However, when on the verge of bankruptcy, an airline does not\nhave the liquidity to buy oil futures. And variable levels of hedging can be useful in\ntransferring profits from one quarter to another. Finally, hedging may be a zero-cost\nsignal to investors that management is technically alert. Perhaps this is the most\ncompelling argument for airline hedging.

Hedging\nbroadly means locking in the cost of future fuel purchases. This protects against\nsudden losses from rising fuel prices. Locking in fuel prices also prevents sudden\ngains from decreasing fuel prices. So airlines hedge fuel to stabilize fuel costs. Fuel\nis about 15% of the airlines\u2019 costs. Other costs are less volatile than fuel prices, so\nhedging fuel stabilizes overall airline costs. More stable costs also mean more stable\nprofits.\nConceptual hedge transaction\nMost fuel hedges are purchases of an oil future. A future is a contract to pay a stated\nprice for an amount of oil on a particular date. If the airline buys a future at $22 per\nbarrel and oil goes up to $33, that contract protects $22 worth of jet fuel purchases\nfrom the expected 50% increase in price. Section 3 examines futures and derivative\ninstruments in some detail. Airlines typically hedge between one and two thirds of\ntheir expected fuel costs. Most airlines look forward six months in their hedging.\nFew hedges are forward more that a year out.\nWhat hedging does\nWhy airlines hedge is the topic of this paper. The commonly stated reason is that\nhedging stabilize fuel prices and therefore overall costs, cash flows, and profits. The\nimplication is that the market will respond to reduced volatility in profits with a\nhigher price for the airline\u2019s stock. This implication is deduced from the correct\nobservation that risk has a cost in the investment marketplace.\n3Airline profits are volatile for two reasons. First, travel demand is sensitive to\nconsumer confidence, which itself is correlated with stock market performance. And\nsecond, airlines themselves are highly leveraged, in the sense that the total value of\noutstanding stock is a small fraction of annual incomes. Small changes in profits as a\nfraction of revenues make for large changes in the return to stock shares.\nThe theory behind airline fuel hedges is to reduce a major source of swings in profits,\nand thus higher prices for the airlines\u2019 stocks. This theory is confirmed by analysts\nwho forecast airline stock prices. They observe and comment on the degree to which\nan airline might be hedged, whenever fuel prices themselves are uncertain.\nMost traded airlines today hedge fuel costs. This has not always been the case. As\nrecently as 15 years ago, fuel hedging was rare. European flag carriers used currency\nhedges long before fuel price hedges became common.\nLogic of hedging\nThe theoretical justification for hedging fuel costs is weak. Classical investment\ntheory holds that investors reward stocks for their performance as part of a larger\nportfolio. And portfolio investors can hedge oil to balance their returns at their own\ndiscretion. As we shall see later, there are conditions where hedging does help.\nHowever, the baseline case of using hedging to reduce airline profit swings is weak.\nThere are even market reasons to avoid hedging.\n42 Economic fundamentals\nExpected value is zero\nThe first inescapable market fundamental is that the expected value of a fuel hedge is\nzero. Airlines that \u2018make money\u2019 hedging fuel and can rely on doing so in the future\nought to open a separate division for speculating in oil prices (at least one did: United\nAirlines). Otherwise, the betting on oil is evenly balanced between sellers and\nbuyers. The markets are deep, meaning they are heavily traded, liquid, and attract the\nattention of lots of professional traders: oil suppliers and portfolio investors alike.\nAirline purchases are small, and do not change the market prices. So airlines are\ngetting the market price. And that market price represents a well-examined\nconsensus. The expected value of such a bet is zero. If the airlines\u2019 expect\notherwise, they are no longer hedging. They are speculating in oil. Nor do ex-post\nexamples of profitable hedging justify hedging as a general practice.\nThe idea that the airlines profit only by chance from long-term hedging\npractices does not interfere with the reasoning behind hedging. Airlines are not\nhedging to improve profits. They are hedging to reduce the swings in profits. That is\nto say, they are hedging to make profits stay closer to average.\nInvestors should not value market hedges\nThe second market fundamental is that investors should not reward reduced profit\nvolatility with higher stock prices if that reduction is effected by hedging with market\ninstruments. The common benchmark for this kind of statement is the CAPM theory\nof investments (see Sharpe, 1964). CAPM says that investors average away firm-\nspecific risk by owning a portfolio of stocks. Investors only pay for reductions in\n5market risk. That is, they expect higher returns for stocks with high correlations with\nmarket moves, and lower returns for stocks with lower \u2018beta\u2019. But they do not\nrequire higher returns for stocks whose profits swing a lot if those swings are\nindependent of the general market.\nIt would seem if forward oil price moves were negatively correlated with\nmarket prices, then oil hedging would reduce an airline\u2019s beta. Let us assume for\ndiscussion that oil prices can counter-balance stock market moves in general. If that\nis the case, that value goes to the oil forward contract, and not to the airline. That is,\nif oil futures counterbalance market risk, they will have a price that reflects the value\nof that counterbalance.1 After all, if investors are clever enough to measure reduced\nairline beta, they are clever enough to discover oil futures on their own.2 As the\nairlines take the oil future risk with their own funds, the investor should find the\ncombined package no more valuable than before. That is, the reduction in risk for the\nairline investment is exactly worth the oil contract\u2019s cost.\nHedging near bankruptcy\nThere is one exception to the efficient market principles. When an airline is near\nbankruptcy, hedging fuel prices may make sense. Bankruptcy brings with it\nadditional losses, as the airline is either sold in pieces, or operated on a cash basis\nunder expensive supervision. An airline near bankruptcy would like to protect itself\nfrom excursion into losses and a thus the expenses of becoming bankrupt. In this\nsituation it pays to insure against sudden fuel price increases that would cause failure.\nUnfortunately, it is at this very moment that acquiring oil price forward contracts is\nimpossible. Contracting future prices requires a guarantee that the company can pay\nthe losses if the contract goes against the airline. No one wants a bet with someone\n6who cannot pay off if they loose. An airline near bankruptcy cannot come up with the\nmargin requirements to back futures commitments. They cannot post a credible bond.\nThe authors have knowledge of several airline bankruptcies and in every case,\nfinancial officers recognized the advantage of a hedge, and understood that they were\nnot in a position to make the appropriate trades.\nThere is a way to hedge that does not require a margin. Airlines can buy a\n\u2018call\u2019 option that pays off above some upper bound on oil prices. However, these\noptions cost cash. In the one case where this was explored, the airline at risk could\nnot make their business plan work if they had to pay for the oil price options. In\nshort, by the time oil price risk is more costly to the airline than to the oil market, the\nairline cannot fund removing the risk.\nThe practice of fuel price hedging\nHedging instruments available\nUp to now the discussion has assumed fuel hedging used futures contracts. In\npractice, fuel price risk can be managed in a number of ways:\n\uf0b7 Forward contracts\n\uf0b7 Futures contracts\n\uf0b7 Options, collars, swaps etc\nForward contracts are \u2018over the counter\u2019 agreements between two parties whereby one\npurchases a fixed amount of fuel from the other at a fixed price at some future date.\nAirline fuel suppliers such as BP Air enter into such agreements, but their tailor-made\n7nature is not a convenient instrument for third parties or speculators. The purchaser\nalso has full counter-party risk.\nFutures are better suited to both hedging and trading, since they are usually\nthrough exchanges that set standard contracts. One party to the contract agrees to\ndeliver to another a standardised quantity of oil at an agreed price (the \u2018strike\u2019 price)\non an agreed date in the future. These can be easily reversed before due date so that\nno physical delivery need take place. In fact, according to NYMEX, less than 1% of\ntrades actually result in the delivery of the underlying commodity, in this case crude\noil and related products.\nThe main exchanges offering these contracts are the International Petroleum\nExchange (IPE) in London and NYMEX in New York. The former\u2019s future is in\nBrent crude oil, one contract being for 1,000 barrels. The quality of the oil is assured,\nand contracts can be fixed for each month up to two years ahead, and then half-yearly\nto three years out. The liquidity for contracts beyond one year forward declines\nsignificantly. There is a Clearing House that guarantees the financial performance of\ncontracts with the help of margin requirements.\nOptions are available in both Brent gas oil and crude at IPE. They are based\non the underlying futures and if exercised (there no obligation to do so) will result in a\ncorresponding futures position. Options offer added flexibility over futures, giving\nholders the possibility to protect themselves against adverse price movements, while\nat the same time giving them the opportunity to participate in favourable movements.\nOptions (and swaps) can also be taken out with other parties (e.g. approved counter-\nparties such as banks) in aviation fuel.\n8Jet fuel is rarely traded on any exchanges and thus must be \u2018over the counter\u2019.\nThese involve counter-party risk for both sides, and thus financially weak airlines\nwould find it hard to find others willing to take this risk.\nMore recently airlines have moved toward using combinations of a call and a\nput option called a collar. The call protects the holder from adverse price increases\nabove its strike price, at a cost of the option premium that must be paid in any event.\nThe holder of this call also writes a put option that limits the advantage it can take of\nprice reductions below its strike price. The total cost of taking the two options is the\ncall option premium paid less the put option premium received. This is popular with\nairlines since it locks in the price that will be paid for fuel between two known values.\nA collar limits the speculative risk to a small range of price moves.\nSwaps are tailor-made futures contracts whereby an airline exchanges\npayments at a future date (which can be in jet aviation fuel and could be further into\nthe future than possible through commodity exchanges), based on the fuel or oil price.\nThese could be arranged with a supplier such as Air BP. The airline would buy a\nswap for a period of, say, one year at a certain strike price for a specified amount of\njet fuel per month. The average price for that month is then compared with the strike\nprice, and if it exceeds it the counter-party would pay the airline the difference times\nthe amount of fuel. However, if it were lower, then the airline would pay the\ndifference. They lock in a given price, as with forward contracts.\nIn summary, aviation fuel itself can only be hedged through over-the-counter\narrangements with the additional counter-party risk. Hedging oil on exchanges such\nas NYMEX or SIMEX that regulate standardised contracts eliminates counter-party\nrisk. These also are more liquid, and allow an airline to sell before due date. For\n9longer periods into the future only crude oil instruments have good liquidity. Jet fuel\ncontracts only have liquidity for shorter periods.\nHedging instrument suitability\nHedging using jet kerosene clearly fully reflects price movements in the commodity\nthat the airline actually needs to operate its aircraft.3 Apart from a little-traded\nJapanese market, there are no exchange-traded futures available in aviation fuel,\nalthough over-the-counter contracts can be arranged.\nThe most liquid market available for the most closely related product is crude\noil, with contracts available in both Brent and US WTI crudes. No markets exist for\nOPEC produced oil products, although the market prices for these track very closely\nthe above two supplies.\nInsert figure 1 about here\nFigure 1 shows trends in both jet kerosene and crude prices between 1989 and 2003.\nThe premium for jet kerosene varies from around 5 cents to 15 cents. The wider\ndivergence of jet aviation fuel prices from crude prices tends to occur at times of\ngreater volatility in crude prices. This is especially when the original cause of the\nvolatility was war or threat of war. This leads to greater military use of diesel and\ngasoline and a switch of production to these fractions (which might also be\nstockpiled). At the same time there might be a significantly greater demand for jet\nfuel from the military. This means that crude and heating oil are not always an ideal\nhedge against jet aviation price increases.\n10\nAviation fuel is almost always priced in US dollars, as are oil derivative\ncontracts.4 Airlines are thus faced with the risk of exchange rate movements, where\nthey do not have adequate natural hedge cover. Few airlines outside the US have\nsufficient revenues in US dollars to provide such cover. However, it is sometimes the\ncase that exchange rates move in such a way as to mitigate increases in fuel prices.\nThis was the case in 2004 for many EU carriers, when the weaker dollar offset some\nof the dollar fuel price increase. Most of the larger airlines have hedged foreign\nexchange risks for many years.\nWho hedges?\nAirline approaches to fuel price volatility\nAirlines do not have long-term contracts with fuel suppliers, and are thus faced with\nvolatile input prices. Their contracts are usually linked to the monthly price quoted\nby Platts, and are usually for no longer than one year. Every 10% increase in fuel\nprices can reduce operating margins by 1.7% for American Airlines.\nHow can airlines address this problem?\n\uf0b7 Increase fuel efficiency\n\uf0b7 Pass on increases to their customers\n\uf0b7 Hedge future fuel requirements using physical and derivative markets\nIncreasing fuel efficiency in the short-term relies on changing operating\nprocedures (e.g. cruise speed) or tankering policies. Most of these are already\nexhausted, and there are limits to how much can be achieved, given safety\n11\nrequirements. Replacing existing aircraft with more fuel efficient ones can take place\ngradually. This has the same effect as a permanent policy of hedging fuel. It reduces\nprofit volatility due to fuel price moves.\nAirlines have passed fuel increases on to customers on the cargo side of the\nbusiness for many years. Lufthansa and others publish an index of fuel prices, and the\ntrigger points and resulting surcharge amounts. FedEx does not hedge fuel at all since\nit can rely largely on these surcharges.\nOn the passenger side, surcharges are more rare, but recently most of the major\nEU airlines have done this with some success. On the other hand, US airlines\noperating within the US seldom make such increases stick. Low cost airlines there\nnow account for near one third of capacity, and the competitive situation is more\nintense than in other parts of the world.\nIt is also the norm in many other industries to pass on increases in input prices\nin the short term, while investing in more fuel-efficient systems in the longer term.\nTable 1 shows that many European airlines differentiated their surcharges between\nshort and long-haul trips. Interestingly, KLM\u2019s approach was very different to that of\ntheir new owner, Air France. In Asia, there was a larger variation in surcharge\namounts, while only one US airline had introduced surcharges on international flights\nby August 2004.\nTable 2 shows typical market (end-user) prices faced by American since 1989,\nand the average price they actually accounted for each year, after paying tax and\noffsetting any gain or loss from hedging.\nInsert table 1 about here\n12\nSince 2000, AMR have also reported the gains they made on fuel hedging, and\nso for these years it was possible to calculate their pre-hedging price. They also give\nthe percentage of each year\u2019s projected fuel consumption that was hedged on 31\nDecember of previous year. It can be seen that they were most successful in 2000,\nwhen end-user prices rose by 66% compared to 1999, but AMR\u2019s average price (after\na gain of $545 million on hedging operations) only increased by 42%. In the\nfollowing year (2001) they did not do so well, but reported a gain of $29 million on\nhedging when the market price declined by 14%. However, most of the drop was in\nthe second half of the year, when AMR might have been less covered, and thus able to\nenjoy some of the downside.\nBritish Airways also reported a large gain of nearly \u00a3300 million (around\nUS$400m) on fuel hedging for their financial year ended 31 March 2001, but reported\na loss of \u00a375 million (US$108m) for the following year (British Airways, 2005).\nSingapore Airlines also reported a fuel hedging loss of S$212 million (US$117m) for\nthe same financial year 2001\/02, after smaller profits for the previous year.\nAMR reported that they were only 12% covered at the end of 2003 for 2004\nconsumption (at an equivalent price of just under $28 a barrel). This low level was\npresumably because they thought that the price levels towards the end of 2003 could\nnot be sustained, but also because they could not afford to use scarce cash for swap\ncollateral.\nInsert table 2 about here\n13\nFor example, in October 2003, Brent Crude 3 month futures were trading at a\ndiscount of 5-6% to spot physicals, showing that the market was expecting a fall in\n2004. This was generally the case, apart from over June 2004 and very briefly in\nDecember 2003 (figure 2).\nInsert figure 2 about here\nWhich airlines hedge\nMost major passenger airlines now hedge at least part of their future fuel needs. A\nsurvey of treasurers from 25 of the world\u2019s largest airlines in 1991 revealed that 13\nengaged in fuel futures transactions, managing exposures six months to two years into\nthe future (KPMG\/IATA, 1992). Some state owned airlines such as Air India were\nonly given permission by their central bank to hedge more recently in 2003.\nThree of the eight largest US majors were not hedged for 2004, and one was\nonly hedged for six months of that year.\nInsert table 3 about here\nAll the major European network airlines had hedged a significant part of their\n2005\/05 fuel needs at the date of publication of their latest annual report. British\nAirways were somewhat under-covered, but subsequently increased their hedging\nactivity (table 4).\nInsert table 4 about here\n14\nLess information was available from the annual reports of Asian airlines.\nHowever, in general, less hedging seems to have been undertaken by the still\npredominately state owned airlines. Both Thai Airways and Malyasian reported an\nupper limit of 50% on the volume of expected fuel uplift that could be hedged, with\nAll Nippon also reporting an unspecified limit.\nKorean Airlines reported a gain of Won 282 million from a forward fuel\ncontract in FY2003, reducing their average fuel price paid by 34%. Qantas offset\n73% of their 2003\/04 increased fuel price paid through various unspecified hedging\nactivities. Singapore Airlines were able to offset almost all the price element of their\n2002\/03 increase in fuel costs by hedging, and in the following financial year a\nS$135m fuel cost increase from higher prices was made S$1m worse by hedging\nlosses.\nThe major Chinese airlines (e.g. China Southern, China Eastern and Air\nChina) were (as at end 2004) obliged to purchase their domestic fuel needs from the\nstate oil company at PRC spot prices. They were also not permitted to hedge fuel (or\nforeign exchange) price risk.\nWhich hedging instruments airlines use\nAs discussed in 3.2 above, futures are used by some airlines, but the most popular\nforms of fuel price hedging are options, swaps and collars. The latter are seen as\nbeing less speculative. Crude and heating oil contracts are more widely used than jet\nkerosene, since they can be traded on an exchange. Airlines rarely cover more than\n18 months to 2 years into the future, with most treasurers looking to cover a part of\nrequirements over the next budget or financial year.\n15\nMany airlines are finding it increasingly difficult and expensive to access\ncredit for fuel hedging purposes. To alleviate this problem and to reduce the costs\nassociated with risk premiums IATA is working with leading banks worldwide to use\nthe IATA Clearing House for the settlement of hedging transactions.\nTests in literature\nHedging tests: foreign exchange\nPrevious studies have tended to focus more on foreign currency risk than fuel price\nrisk. Their starting point has been the CAPM assertion that risk management is\nirrelevant to firm value since shareholders are better placed to do this themselves.\nThe counter argument is that in the real world the CAPM theory does not hold\nbecause of factors such as taxation, access to information and economies of scale in\nhedging operations.\nAllayanis and Weston (2001) examined foreign currency derivative users in a\nlarge sample of non-financial US firms between 1990 and 1995. They found that\nthose that used currency hedging had, on average, a 4.87% higher firm value\n(measured as Tobin\u2019s Q) than firms that did not. Their model explained variations in\nQ using a number of different factors in addition to hedging. A dummy variable was\nused to distinguish those firms that did hedge from those that did not. This was\nbecause of the lack of more detailed data on hedging; the period they chose was\ndictated by the lack of any data prior to 1990. Thus the research was not able to take\ninto account the difference between those firms that might have hedged 100% of their\ncurrency needs one year ahead, and those that only hedged 20% of needs; and second,\nbetween those that hedged three months out and those that hedged two years out.\n16\nHedging tests: oil\nCarter et al. (2003) essentially applied the Allayanis and Weston (2001) methodology\nto airline fuel price hedging. They reach similar conclusions: airlines that employ\nhedging trade at a premium. They also assert that this allows them to conserve cash at\ntimes of industry downturn (which coincides with fuel price spikes), giving them the\npossibility to buy assets at distressed prices. This does not seem to be supported by\nevidence, and indeed larger airlines that are hedging are also usually cutting back on\nnew capital investment following a major downturn.\nCobbs and Wolf (2004) repeat the Carter results above as a rebuttal to the\nBritish Airways CEO Rod Eddington\u2019s statement that \u2018a lot is said about hedging\nstrategy, most of it well wide of the mark. I don\u2019t think any sensible airline believes\nthat by hedging it saves on its fuel bills. You just flatten out the bumps and remove\nthe spikes\u2019.5\nRao (1999) takes a different approach by estimating how much better off an\nairline would be if it had bought different heating oil futures at different periods of\ntime. He concluded that quarterly income volatility would have declined by 23% on\nthe basis of following his assumed hedging policy. The author admits that the use of\na fictional airline may have inflated the advantage of hedging. He also assumes that\nthe purchase of futures is costless and the marking to market requirement of some\naccounting requirements ignored.\nMarking to market means accounting for gains or losses in any outstanding\nunrealised derivatives position at the end of each financial reporting period (quarter).\nThis may introduce a new source of volatility in earnings. The latest accounting\nstandards recommend making these value adjustments only on the balance sheet,\n17\nwhere the hedge is expected to be effective throughout its life. Where it is not and its\nprice movements are not perfectly correlated with jet fuel prices, adjustments will\nhave to be made to reported profits.\nMuch research has been undertaken in examining the relationship between oil\nprice movements (and shocks) and both economic activity and corporate profitability\n(and stock prices). Indirectly, this becomes an exploration of whether oil futures have\na beta, as discussed in section 6. Contrasting results were reported for the impact on\nstock prices: Jones and Kaul (1996) found that oil prices do have an effect on\naggregate stock returns, while Huang et al. (1996) found no evidence of any\ncorrelation between oil price future returns and aggregate stock returns. Sadorsky\n(1999) found that positive shocks to oil prices tend to depress real stock returns,\nwhich in turn effect interest rates and industrial production (and thus economic\ngrowth). J P Morgan (2001) found \u2018little correlation between the price of jet fuel and\nairlines\u2019 relative performance on the stock market\u2019.\nDiscussion\nOil prices sometimes move counter to travel demand\nFuel hedges can either decrease or increase volatility. Profit swings will be damped\nwhen fuel prices surge at the same time travel demand falters. Most hedging is said to\nbe aimed at protecting profits against a sudden up-turn in fuel prices. The cases\nuppermost in peoples\u2019 minds seem to be the rise of oil prices caused by warfare in the\nMiddle East. Supply limitations can come from OPEC succeeding at rationing\nproduction, from political actions with secondary suppliers such as Venezuela or\n18\nNigeria, from military action such as the invasion of Kuwait, or from vandalism by\ninternational terrorists. The decrease in oil supply is usually accompanied by losses in\nconsumer and business confidence. Acting together, higher oil prices and lower\nconfidence slow economic activity. And slowed economies and lower confidence\nboth reduce air travel. So the profits from having purchased oil futures at lower prices\ncounterbalance the losses from lower travel revenues and higher jet fuel expenses. An\nairline could contemplate hedging more than 100% of its jet fuel, if it expected a fall\nin revenues to happen at the same time as a rise in fuel prices.\nOil prices sometimes move with travel demand\nHedging increases volatility, in the alternative scenario for oil price increases. The\nsecond driver of fuel price swings is demand. That is, when the economy grows fast,\noil demand rises. This drives prices up. Oil producers imperfectly balance the ups\nand downs of demand for oil with increases or decreases in production. And when\nhigher demand makes supply tight, OPEC finds it easier to establish production limits.\nOn the other hand, when demand drops below production plans, market prices\nbecome more competitive. The collusive actions of OPEC add to the cost-based\nsupply curve in moving oil prices in parallel with economic growth. Add on, air\ntravel also responds to economic cycles. Travel grows once as a fundamental with\neconomic activity levels, and once again with cycles of consumer and producer\nconfidence. When world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is driving oil prices, the\nvalue of oil forward contracts will be high at the same time that air travel demand is\nhigh, and low when air travel demand is low. In these situations, profits from\nhedging coincide with high airline operating profits, and hedging adds to airline\n19\noperating losses when air travel is less profitable. The economic cycle is made worse\nby hedging, not better, when oil price moves are demand- rather than supply-driven.\nResults depend on time period studied\nWhether hedging on average smoothes or exacerbates airline profit cycles depends on\nwhat time period is used to measure the correlation of fuel price changes and airline\noperating results. The selection of periods that cover major Middle Eastern events\nwill demonstrate that hedging reduces volatility. By selecting periods where Middle\nEastern politics were calm, one finds that hedging increases volatility. Figure 3\ncompares oil spot prices with detrended US stock market moves. Figure 4 shows that\nthe correlation of oil and stock market moves back and forth from positive to\nnegative. The particular correlation shown in figure 4 is a centered, moving, 3-year\nwindow.\nInsert figure 3 about here\nThus the answer to \u2018does hedging reduce volatility?\u2019 is \u2018sometimes\u2019. Airlines that\nhedge in anticipation of political uncertainty in major oil-producing regions but do not\nhedge when such activity is unlikely could be reducing volatility. However, that\nsimply says that airlines that make money in the long run with their fuel hedges also\nreduce their profit volatilities. And airlines that can predictably make money\nspeculating in oil prices will always do better than airlines without this exceptional\nability, or luck.\n20\nHedging can alter the timing of profits\nHowever, the real reason for airlines hedging fuel prices may not be economic. The\ndiscussion has focused on the pure case of an airline that consistently hedges, gets no\nlong-run profits from hedging itself, and seeks merely to damp the swings in\ncorporate profits. Airlines may hedge intermittently, and for reasons not associated\nwith the expected profitability of the hedges.\nAirlines can move profits forward or backwards by timing the sale of their oil\nfutures. If profits are falling, but oil futures are in the money, the contracts can be\nsold before their closing date for immediate profits. This moves cash flow to an\nearlier quarter, since the degree and timing of hedging is not public until well after the\nfact. This means an airline can \u2018show\u2019 profits or cover losses in quarterly reports at\nthe expense of lower profits in the later quarter, when the hedges were due. Recently,\nmost of the unrealised value changes are required to be shown on the balance sheet,\nbut not in the income statement. This means airlines can still move profits around by\ntimely sales of profitable contracts before their expiry dates.\nIn practice, cash-strapped airlines do this. In the search for liquidity, they sell\nthe profitable oil contracts early. Delta Air Lines settled all their fuel hedge contracts\nprior to their maturity in February 2004, receiving proceeds of US$83 million almost\nall of which added to profits (Delta Air Lines, 2005, F-22). In the absence of\nliquidity, the very same airlines are unable to raise the margin requirements for\nmaking further oil forward contracts in the more distant future. So they reduce their\nlevel of fuel hedging in the face of short-term profit downswings. Investors see\nimmediate reports that understate the degree of immediate losses, and they do not see\nthe reduced hedging further ahead.\nDeleted: . S\nDeleted: \u00b6\n21\nDuring labour contract negotiations airlines may wish to delay reporting\nprofits. This would mislead the long-term stakeholders (the employees and their\nunion leaders) at the expense of also misleading short-term stakeholders (the stock\nholders). Of course the justification is that the labour contracts could be more\nfavourable to the stockholders than otherwise. The authors are not aware of hedging\nused in this manner, but have frequently seen manipulation of fleet sales and other\nexpressions of the desire to alter the timing of profits.\nVariable hedging might lower stock values by confusing profit signals\nAirlines that change the amounts of their hedging increase the uncertainty of their\nstock, as an investment in the longer term. If quarterly profits are masked by\nchanging fuel hedging levels, then the quarterly profit information becomes less\nuseful in predicting how well the fundamental airline activity is doing. Investors\nvalue predictability. So this could reduce stock values. At least in theory.\nAirlines that move profits may be doing themselves a disservice in that they\ndecrease the visibility of the performance of their basic business. However, in\npractice such moves are made only as bankruptcy approaches. In these cases, hedging\nis only one of many changes in the face of needs for immediate cash. Airlines will\nalso run advance-purchase sales to collect current revenues against future\ntransportation liabilities, and eliminate investments in personnel, relationships,\nequipment, and inventories at the expense of future higher costs or lower revenues.\nMany of these moves are far more distortionary than variable hedging.\n22\nHedging as a signal of management competence\nMarket fundamentals claim hedging is without excess profit, and that any reduction in\nprofit volatility is not valued by the marketplace. If this is true, why do so many\nairlines hedge, and why do stock analysts comment on it?\nHedging could be a fashion statement. If hedging is of no economic value, it\nis also of no economic cost. If industry analysts consider hedging as a sign of\ncompetent management, then management is motivated to accommodate the fashion,\nand the stock price is suitably rewarded. It could even be that early analyst comments\non hedging were intended merely to indicate the need for adjustments when\ncomparing the profit streams of different airlines through economic cycles. At some\npoint the observations suggested market interest in hedging, possibly implying\napproval. And once hedging sends the market signal that an airline is well-managed,\nit becomes sensible to hedge. This would be reinforced by the reverse-causality that\nairlines near bankruptcy cannot hedge. So airlines that hedge collectively outperform\nthose that do not.\nIt is true today that both industry and supplier managers believe hedging is a\nsign of competent airline management. Many of these managers have skills and\neducation in areas other than finance. Indeed, chief financial officers and the treasury\ndepartments of suppliers seem less fascinated by hedging than management in\ngeneral. The idea that hedging is merely an external sign of alert management, and\nnot a fundamental economic benefit, is difficult to test. However, markets themselves\nare susceptible to \u2018bubbles\u2019 of confidence. This could turn out to be one.\nConclusions\n23\nMost of the major airlines are hedging fuel using jet fuel, gas oil and crude\nderivatives. Few cover more than 12 months\u2019 expected consumption, and it is rare to\nfind more than 80% of future needs hedged beyond three months ahead. Crude oil\nprovides more liquidity and flexibility for hedging, but the spread between crude and\njet aviation fuel had tended to widen at times of market instability. Not many airlines\nreport gains and losses from fuel hedging activity, but many are now required to\nreport the market value of unexpired contracts on their balance sheets.\nThere seems to be no reason to contradict the economic fundamentals of\nhedging. A policy of permanent hedging of fuel costs should leave expected long-run\nprofits unchanged. If it damps out profit volatility, it should do so in a way that the\nmarket would not value. Data suggests it may not damp out volatility, after all. Oil\nprices and air travel demand cycles are correlated when oil supply reductions drive\nGDP declines. But oil and travel are negatively correlated when GDP demand surges\ndrive oil price increases. So oil prices can be observed to either increase or decrease\nairline profit cycles, depending on the time period sampled.\nA fuel price hedge would create exceptional value is when an airline is on the\nedge of bankruptcy. However, when on the verge of bankruptcy, an airline does not\nhave the liquidity to buy oil futures. On the other hand, foreign exchange hedges\nprobably did make sense, when airlines were state-supported. And variable levels of\nhedging can be useful in transferring profits from one quarter to another.\nFinally, hedging may be a zero-cost signal to investors that management is\ntechnically alert. Perhaps this is the most compelling argument for airline hedging.\nHowever, it lies more in the realm of the psychology of markets than the mathematics\nof economics.\n24\nNotes\n1. Indeed, if oil futures have a negative beta, the value will appear as a premium in\nthe future price over the expected value of oil. The expected loss would be the\nmarket\u2019s payment for the value of the negative beta risk. This as been offered as a\npossible explanation for six-year futures in 2005 being above the inflation-\nadjusted cost of new long-run alternative fuel sources, such as Canadian oil shale.\n2. The original version of CAPM defined the \u2018market\u2019 as only stocks. A broader\nCAPM theory includes all investment vehicles\u2014bonds, real estate, commodities,\nand futures including oil\u2014in the total market and its beta.\n3. Leaving aside the aviation gasoline that airlines operating small piston-engined\naircraft require.\n4. There are rare occasions when prices are quoted in local currency, and some\nairlines ask for the transport element in fuel prices to be charged separately in\nlocal currency (since this cost is incurred in local currency).\n5.
