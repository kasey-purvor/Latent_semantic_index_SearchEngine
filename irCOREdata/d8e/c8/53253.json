Introduction \nComparisons of the differences in the beam interaction characteristics with various materials of the \npredominant materials processing lasers, the CO2, the Nd:YAG and the excimer laser, are few. Previously \nthe fundamental differences resulting from wavelength variations of CO, CO2, Nd:YAG and excimer \nlasers for a number of materials processing applications have been given [1-4]. Likewise, such practical \ncomparisons between these traditional materials processing lasers and the more contemporary high power \ndiode laser (HPDL) are even fewer in number. Previously Schmidt et al. [5] compared the performance of \nCO2, excimer and HPDL in the removal of chlorinated rubber coatings from concrete surfaces, noting the \nwavelength dependent differences in the process performance. Additionally, Bradley et al. [6] compared \nthe CO2 and HPDL for the treatment of Al2O3-based refractory materials in terms of microstructure, \nobserving differing wavelength dependent microstructural characteristics for each laser. In comprehensive \ninvestigations, Lawrence et al. [7, 8] compared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and HPDL radiation \non the wettability characteristics of an Al2O3\/SiO2 based ceramic, noting that changes in the wettability \ncharacteristics of the material varied depending upon the laser type. \nThe interfacial phenomena of wetting is often the primary factor governing whether a coating will adhere \nand bond to a substrate in practical applications such as enamelling. At present, very little work has been \npublished with regard to the use of lasers for altering the surface properties of materials in order to \nimprove their wettability characteristics. Notwithstanding this, it is recognised within the currently \npublished work that laser irradiation of material surfaces can effect its wettability characteristics. \nPreviously Zhou et al [9, 10] have carried out work on laser coating of aluminium alloys with ceramic \nmaterials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on the well documented fact that generated oxide layers often \npromote metal\/oxide wetting. Furthermore, Heitz et al. [11], Henari et al. [12] and Olfert et al. [13] have \n 3 \nfound that excimer laser treatment of metals results in improved coating adhesion. The improvements in \nadhesion were attributed to the fact that the excimer laser treatment resulted in a smoother surface and as \nsuch enhanced the action of wetting. However, the reasons for these changes with regard to changes in the \nmaterial\u2019s surface morphology, surface composition and surface energy were not reported. \nNotwithstanding this, work on HPDL modification of the wettability characteristics of a number of \ndifferent ceramic materials [14] has shown that the wettability performance is affected by changes in the \nsurface roughness, the surface O2 content and the surface energy.  \nThis present work describes the beam interaction characteristics of several industrial lasers: 1 kW CO2 \nlaser, 400 W Nd:YAG laser, 5 W KrF excimer laser and 1.2 kW HPDL with a common mild steel in \nterms of the wettability characteristics. These incorporate chiefly: contact angle variations, differences in \nmorphological features, surface composition, and surface energy changes. \n2. Theoretical background \nWhen a drop of liquid is in contact with a solid surface, the final shape taken by the drop, and thus \nwhether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative magnitudes of the molecular forces that \nexist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and the solid (adhesive) [15]. The index of this \neffect is the contact angle, \u03b8, which the liquid subtends with the solid. The adhesion intensity of a liquid \nto a solid surface is known as the work of adhesion, Wad, and is related to the liquid surface energy, \u03b3lv, by \nthe Young-Dupre equation: \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (1) \nThe influence of the substrate surface roughness on the wetting contact angle is also of great importance, \nbeing described by Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (2) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas, \u03b3sv is the solid \nsurface energy, \u03b3sl is the solid-liquid surface energy and \u03b8w is the contact angle for the wetting of a rough \nsurface. Clearly, as Equation (2) shows, the influence of surface roughness on the contact angle is to \naffect an increase in the contact angle. Thus, the smoother the contact surface is, the smaller the contact \nangle will be. \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [16]. The majority of these \nforces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total surface \nenergy (\u03b3) comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component). As such, \nWad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the interface [16]: \n 4 \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (3) \nBy equating Equation (3) with Equation (1), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to \nthe surface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n     \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (4) \nIn accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [16] and Agathopoulos et al. [17], it is possible                    \nto reasonably estimate the dispersive component of the mild steel surface energy,\u03b3 sv\nd\n, by plotting the \ngraph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv in accordance with Equation (4) [16]. The value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is then \nestimated from the gradient of the line which connects the origin with the intercept point of the straight \nline correlating the data point with the abscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1.  \nAs affirmed by the work of Fowkes [16] and Agathopoulos et al. [17], it is not possible to determine the \nvalue of the polar component of the mild steel surface energy,\u03b3 sv\np\n, directly. This is because the intercept \nof the straight line only refers to individual control liquids and not the control liquid system as a whole. \nHowever, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface energies due to dispersion forces \neither of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability performance [16, 18]. It is therefore possible \nto calculate the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n, from Equation (3). Indeed, for each \nparticular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and laser treated mild steel surfaces, Wad  has \nbeen correlated with Wad\nd\n by a linear relationship. Thus the following can be derived [8]: \n  ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (5) \nFrom a plot of the linear relationship between Wad and Wad\nd\n, a (the gradient of the relationship \nbetweenWad and Wad\nd\n) can be determined for the untreated and laser treated mild steel.  \n3. Experimental procedures \nThe general operating characteristics of the lasers used in the study are detailed in Table 1. For all \nexperiments the assist gas used was O2. Both pulsed and CW lasers were employed, therefore, both the \naverage power and the peak power of each laser will differ. Thus the laser energy density (fluence) of \neach laser beam was set such that the laser power densities, interaction times and traverse speeds of each \nlaser was 159 J\/cm2. \n 5 \nThe liquids used for the wetting experiments were human blood, human blood plasma, glycerol and 4-\noctanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as well as the dispersive ( \u03b3 2\nd ) and \npolar ( \u03b3 2\np ) components, are detailed elsewhere [14]. The solid materials used as substrates in the wetting \nexperiments were rectangular billets (50 x 100mm with a thickness of 3mm) of common engineering low \ncarbon mild steel (EN8). The contact surfaces of the materials were used as-received in the experiments.  \nThe wetting experiments were carried out in atmospheric conditions at room temperature.                      \nThe droplets were released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the test substrate materials  (treated \nand untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of each drop being approximately \n6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops taken \nat minute intervals, with the contact angle subsequently being measured. The experimental results showed \nthat throughout the period of the tests no discernible change in the magnitude of the contact angle \noccurred.  \nSurface analysis of the samples after laser treatment was conducted using scanning electron \nmicroscopy (SEM) and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), with surface roughness measurements \nbeing obtained using a Taylor-Hobson (Surtronic 3+) profileometer.   \n4. Results \nAs one can see from Table 2, laser irradiation of the surfaces of the mild steel samples resulted in changes \nin the contact angle depending upon the laser used. One possible reason for this is that the surfaces \nobtained after laser treatment are altered considerably; being smoother than the original untreated surface \n(1.46\u00b5m), in the case of the HPDL (1.12\u00b5m and the Nd:YAG laser (1.25\u00b5m), and rougher in the case of \nthe CO2 (2.58\u00b5m) and excimer lasers (2.12\u00b5m). As Equation (2) shows, if the roughness factor, r, is large, \nthat is the solid surface is smooth, then \u03b3sl will become small, thus, a reduction in the contact angle will be \ninherently realised by the liquid if \u03b8<900 [16].  \nFigure 2 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv for the untreated and laser treated mild              \nsteel-experimental control liquids system. As discussed above, it is possible to determine directly from \nFigure 2 the dispersive component of the mild steel surface energy,\u03b3 sv\nd\n. The values subsequently obtained \nfor\u03b3 sv\nd\n, as well as those calculated for\u03b3 sv\np\nusing Equation (5) are shown in Table 2.  \nThe O2 content of a material\u2019s surface is another influential factor in the wetting performance of the \nmaterial [19, 20]. Wetting is governed by the first atomic layers of the surface of a material. Thus, in \norder to determine the content of O2 on the surface of the mild steel XPS analysis was used. The surface \nO2 content was found to increase after interaction with the CO2, Nd:YAG and HPDL beams from an \n 6 \ninitial value of 34.2% to 41.5%, 35.7% and 40.1% respectively. Conversely, interaction of the mild steel \nwith excimer laser radiation resulted in the surface O2 content decreasing to 32.8%. \n \n \n5. Discussion \nIn the instances where the surface of the mild steel has become roughened as a consequence of laser \ninteraction, it is thought that the roughening is occasioned as a result of excess energy being absorbed by \nthe surface of the mild steel, leading therefore to a high level of surface melting. As was observed from a \nSEM analysis, this in turn caused micro-porosities and a generally rough surface profile. In the case of the \nexcimer laser, singularly, the laser radiation did not cause melting of the surface, but instead induced \nsurface ablation which consequently resulted in a rough surface. Kokai et al. [21] have concluded that \nwith excimer laser parameters which are conducive to the production of plasma, as was the case with the \nmild steel, then the surface roughness is increased as a result of plasma induced debris redepositing on the \nsurface and excessive thermally induced surface fractures and porosities. Since plasma generation was \nobserved, then surface roughening after excimer laser irradiation was perhaps to be expected.  \nIn contrast, the surface smoothing of the mild steel after HPDL interaction is caused as a result of the \nsurface absorbing a level of energy such that an adequate degree of surface melting occurs. Accordingly, \na minimum surface roughness, and thus contact angle, is achieved. Similar laser induced surface \nsmoothing effects were obtained by Nicolas et al. [22] and Henari et al. [12], who observed that excimer \nlaser treatment of ceramics and metals could result in the generation of a smoother surface. Olfert et al. \n[13] found also that excimer laser treatment of steel surfaces greatly improved the adhesion of a zinc \ncoating. They asserted that laser treatment occasioned the smoothing of many of the high frequency \nsurface features, resulting in more complete wetting by the zinc. \nA comparison of the ordinate intercept points of the untreated and laser treated mild steel-liquid systems \nin Figure 2 shows that for the mild steel-liquid systems of the HPDL and Nd:YAG laser treated mild steel \nsamples the ordinate intercept is higher above the origin than those of the untreated, CO2 and excimer \nlaser treated mild steel samples. This is indicative of the increased action of polar forces across the \ninterface, in addition to dispersion forces, in the HPDL and Nd:YAG laser treated mild steel. Hence \nimproved wettability and adhesion is promoted [16, 23]. Furthermore, because none of the best-fit straight \nlines intercept below the origin, then it can be said that the development of an equilibrium film pressure \nof adsorbed vapour on the mild steel surface (untreated and laser treated) did not occur [16, 23]. \n6. Conclusion \n 7 \nInteraction of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and high power diode laser (HPDL) radiation with the surface of \nthe mild steel was found to effect changes in the wettability characteristics of the material. Such changes \nwere identified as being primarily due to: modifications to the surface roughness, changes in the surface \noxygen content and changes in the surface energy of the mild steel. A wavelength dependence of the \nchange of the wetting properties can be deduced from the findings of this work.  \nReferences \n1. F.
