Comparisons between bistatic scatter measure-\nments and simulation results during the Troms\u00f8 HF pumping\nexperiment on 16 February 1996 are made. Doppler mea-\nsurements of an HF diagnostic signal scattered from the field-\naligned irregularities (FAIs) in the auroral E-region were car-\nried out on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path at\n9410 kHz from 21:00 to 22:00 UT. The scattered signals were\nobserved both from natural and artificial ionospheric irregu-\nlarities located in the vicinity of Troms\u00f8. To simulate the\nDoppler frequency shifts, fd , of scattered signals, a radio\nchannel model, named CONE, was developed. The model\nallows for ray tracing, group and phase paths, and Doppler\nfrequency shift calculations. The calculated Doppler shifts\nwere analyzed for dependence on the magnitude and direc-\ntion of plasma velocities in the scattering volume. It was\nfound that the velocity components in the north-south direc-\ntion are crucial for explaining the Doppler frequency shifts of\nthe scattered diagnostic signals. To simulate fd , real veloc-\nities obtained from the EISCAT UHF radar at an altitude of\n278 km and from the digital all-sky imager during the exper-\niment were employed. The simulation results of Doppler fre-\nquency shift variations with time are in reasonable agreement\nwith the experimental Doppler shifts of scattered signals on\nthe London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path.\nKey words. Ionosphere (active experiments; ionospheric ir-\nregularities) Radio science (ionospheric propagation)\n1 Introduction\nModification experiments in which the nightside auroral\nionosphere is irradiated by powerful HF radio waves have\nrevealed a multitude of nonlinear phenomena caused by the\ninteraction of the HF pump wave and ionospheric plasma\n(Djuth et al., 1985; Noble et al., 1987; Blagoveshchenskaya\net al., 1998a, 1999, 2001; Brandstro\u00a8m et al., 1999). One\nCorrespondence to: N. F. Blagoveshchenskaya\n(nataly@aari.nw.ru)\nof the prominent phenomena from HF modification experi-\nments is the generation of artificial field-aligned irregularities\n(AFAIs) with scale sizes of the order of a few meters across\nthe magnetic field lines. At high-latitudes AFAIs can be ex-\ncited not only in the F-region, but in the auroral E-region as\nwell. Recent studies of these heater-induced irregularities in\nthe F2-layer of the ionosphere showed that their motion was\nconsistent with the background plasma drift (Eglitis et al.,\n1998).\nIn an earlier publication, Blagoveshchenskaya et al. (2001)\nexamined the experimental results from Troms\u00f8 HF pumping\nexperiments in the nightside auroral E-region. Bistatic scat-\nter measurements were carried out on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8\n\u2013 St. Petersburg path using the Doppler spectral method from\nSt. Petersburg at a distance of about 1200 km from Troms\u00f8.\nIt was shown that the scattered signals were observed both\nfrom natural and artificial ionospheric irregularities during\nthe HF pumping experiment on 16 February 1996.\nThe present paper concentrates on the simulation of di-\nagnostic HF scattered signals on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013\nSt. Petersburg path during the Troms\u00f8 HF pumping experi-\nment on 16 February 1996. The goal is to compare the sim-\nulated and observed Doppler frequency shifts fd of the di-\nagnostic HF signals scattered from field-aligned small-scale\nirregularities. To simulate fd , plasma velocities in the scat-\ntering volume obtained from EISCAT UHF radar (Rishbeth\nand van Eyken, 1993) measurements, as well as from digital\nall-sky imager (DASI) (Kosch et al., 1998) observations were\nemployed. DASI is located at Skibotn, about 50 km from the\nEISCAT HF pump facility.\n2 Observational results\nBistatic scatter measurements of HF diagnostic signals were\ncarried out on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path\nat 9410 kHz. Ionospheric modification was produced by the\nEISCAT HF heating facility (Rietveld et al., 1993) located\nnear Troms\u00f8 (geographical coordinates 69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E,\n1480 T. D. Borisova et al.: Doppler shift simulation of scattered HF signals\nFig. 1. Dynamic Doppler spectra (sonogram) of HF diagnostic signals on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8\u2013 St. Petersburg path at 9410 kHz during the\nTroms\u00f8 HF pumping experiment on 16 February 1996. Direct signal propagating from the transmitter to the receiver along a great circle path\ncorresponds to 0 Hz Doppler frequency. The intervals when the Troms heater was turned on are marked by bars on the time axis: (a) raw\ndynamic Doppler spectra; (b) dynamic Doppler spectra with five types of Doppler tracks displayed on the sonogram. The following Doppler\ntracks can be recognized from the sonogram: (1) the long-lived track from 21:10 to 21:26 UT with Doppler frequency shifts changing from\npositive to negative values; (2) the negative tracks of 21:20\u201321:22 UT, 21:22\u201321:23 UT and 21:24\u201321:28 UT with increasing negative values\nof Doppler frequency shift; (3) the wave-like track with periods of about 100\u2013120 s observed from 21:23:30 to 21:30:30 UT; (4) burst-like\nDoppler tracks closely related to the points in time at which the Troms\u00f8 HF heating facility is turned on or off; (5) wave-like tracks closely\nrelated to the heater-on periods of 21:10\u201321:14 and 21:20\u201321:24 UT.\nL = 6.2, magnetic dip angle I = 78\u25e6). The exper-\niment was conducted on 16 February 1996 from 21:00\nto 23:00 UT. The main parameters of the Troms\u00f8 heater\nwere the following: heater frequency = 4040 kHz; polariza-\ntion = O-mode; effective radiated power (ERP) = 150 MW;\ntransmission scheme = 4 min on \/6 min off. The antenna\nbeam was tilted 6\u25e6 to the south, allowing for HF pumping\nin a near field-aligned direction. The diagnostic HF trans-\nmitter is located near London (52\u25e6 N, 0\u25e6 E). The reception of\ndiagnostic waves, scattered from field-aligned irregularities\n(FAIs) above Troms\u00f8, was made using the Doppler spectral\nmethod from St. Petersburg (60\u25e6 N, 30.5\u25e6 E).\nDuring the experiment the Troms\u00f8 dynasonde showed the\npresence of a sporadic Es layer. However, foEs remained\nless than the heater frequency fH during the first two heater-\non periods (21:00\u201321:04 UT and 21:10\u201321:14 UT). Hence,\nthe pump wave was not reflected from Es layer. Since the\nelectron density was low in the F2-layer as well, the HF\npump wave was not reflected from the ionosphere at all. In\nthe following, heater-on periods foEs exceeded fH , result-\ning in reflection of the powerful HF radio wave from the spo-\nradic Es layer.\nFigure 1 shows the dynamic Doppler spectra on the Lon-\ndon \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path obtained on 16 Febru-\nary 1996 from 21:08 to 21:40 UT. Figure 1a shows the raw\ndynamic Doppler spectra. The spectral structure of the HF\nsignals scattered from FAIs is quite complicated. However,\nanalysis of the dynamic Doppler spectra allows for five dif-\nferent types of Doppler tracks to be identified, as shown in\nFig. 1b.\nThe first type of track (track 1) was observed continu-\nously from 21:15 to 21:26 UT, irrespective of whether the\nHF heater was turned on or off. The distinctive feature of this\ntrack is the change in sign of the Doppler frequency shifts fd\nfrom positive to negative, that takes place at 21:20 UT. Upon\nreaching the maximum negative value of fd at 21:23 UT,\ntrack 1 turns back towards a zero Doppler frequency shift.\nTracks 2 are negative with increasing negative values\nof Doppler frequency shift from 21:20\u201321:22 UT, 21:22\u2013\n21:23 UT, and 21:24\u201321:28 UT.\nA very intense wave-like track (track 3) with a period\nof about 100\u2013120 s appeared at 21:23:30 UT at the end of\nthe heater-on period of 21:20\u201321:24 UT. Its duration was\nabout 7 min. It was found that variations of Doppler fre-\nquency shift with time are in a good agreement with electron\ndensity changes over Troms\u00f8. A comparison between fd\nT. D. Borisova et al.: Doppler shift simulation of scattered HF signals 1481\nFig. 2. Temporal variations of electron density Ne at 150 km alti-\ntude from Troms\u00f8 EISCAT UHF radar measurements and Doppler\nfrequency variations fd characterizing track 3 on 16 February 1996.\nvariations characterizing track 3 and Ne changes at an alti-\ntude of 150 km from EISCAT UHF radar measurements at\nTroms\u00f8 is shown in Fig. 2.\nAn interesting feature of the HF pumping experiment on\n16 February 1996 is exhibited by the fourth type of track\n(track 4). These burst-like tracks are closely related to the\npoint in time at which the Troms\u00f8 heater is turned on and\noff. The duration of the burst-like tracks is about 10\u201315 s.\nWhen turning on the Troms\u00f8 HF heater, a burst in fd to\n\u221210 Hz occurs in the negative part of the Doppler sonogram.\nHF heater turn off leads to the appearance of a fd burst to\n+8 Hz in the positive part of sonogram. The most pronounced\nburst-like tracks were observed in the heater-on periods of\n21:10\u201321:14 UT and 21:30\u201321:34 UT. It is interesting to\nnote that similar negative burst-like Doppler tracks were ob-\nserved from bistatic scatter measurements when turning on\nthe SURA heating facility (see Fig. 6 of Blagoveshchenskaya\net al., 1998b).\nDuring the pump cycle of 21:10\u201321:14 UT the powerful\nHF radio wave was not reflected from the ionosphere due to\nfH exceeding foEs (fH > foEs). In addition, the heater\nfrequency fH was equal to the upper hybrid frequency fUH ,\ni.e. f 2H = f 2UH = f 2o Es + f 2c , where foEs is the maximum\nfrequency of the sporadic Es layer and fc is the cyclotron\nfrequency. Note that the excitation of artificial field-aligned\nirregularities in the auroral Es layer is possible with the con-\nstraint fH > foEs , but f 2H = f 2o Es + f 2c , as described by\nDjuth et al. (1985).\nThe fifth type of track is closely related to the heater-on pe-\nriods of 21:10\u201321:14 UT and 21:20\u201321:24 UT. These wave-\nlike tracks, with periods of about 80\u2013120 s, are displayed in\nthe positive part of the Doppler sonogram. During the HF\npumping cycle of 21:10\u201321:14 UT the appearance and dis-\nappearance of the fifth type of track coincides in time with\nthe burst-like heater-induced tracks of the fourth type. As a\nresult, it is believed that this track was produced by HF diag-\nnostic signals scattered from artificial field-aligned irregular-\nities.\nIt is of interest to compare the observed wavy tracks with\nthe behaviour of the X and Y components of the magnetic\nfield variations at Troms\u00f8. In order to do this, the spectral\ncomponents of fd , X and Y were computed. The compari-\nson showed an absence of correlation between the Doppler\nfrequency shift variations and magnetic field variations.\nThe Doppler tracks shown in Fig. 1b suggest that the scat-\ntered signals were observed both from natural (first, second\nand third types) and artificial (the fourth and fifth types) field-\naligned irregularities.\n3 Modelling\nThe problem of HF radio-wave propagation in an inhomo-\ngeneous anisotropic (magnetoactive) ionosphere was solved\nwithin the framework of the geometric optics method. In this\ncontext, the solution of the wave equation and determination\nof the ray path is an Eikonal function solution. The solution\nof the Eikonal function is equivalent to finding the depen-\ndence of \u03c9 = \u03c9(k), where \u03c9 is the wave (angular) frequency\n(\u03c9 = 2pif ), and k is the wave vector.

Signs\n\u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2013\u201d in Doppler frequency shift are in accordance with the\nmovements of FAIs in the direction of the receiver (+fd ) and from\nthe receiver (\u2212fd ).\ntraces, as well as the group and phase paths to be calculated.\nThe numerical solution of equation system (1) is performed\nin the standard way (Haslegrove, 1955) as the solution of the\ndifferential equations of radio-wave propagation in a mag-\nnetoactive plasma using Runge-Kutta methods in spherical\ncoordinates.\nThe propagation direction of the HF diagnostic wave on\nthe London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path is given by two\ngreat circle paths as follows: the first path is from the diag-\nnostic transmitter (London) to the scattering volume above\nTroms\u00f8 and the second one is from the scattering volume\nto the receiver (St. Petersburg). The boundary condition for\nlinking the solutions for the two propagation paths is the FAI-\ninduced scattering cone, given by\n(ko \u00b7H ) = (ks \u00b7H ) , (3)\nwhere ko and ks are the wave vectors of the incident and\nscattered wave, correspondingly, and H is the vector of the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field. The simulation of the geometry of\nthe diagnostic HF signals scattered from FAIs in the auroral\nE-region on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path was\nconsidered by Blagoveshchenskaya et al. (1999).\nThe CONE program also calculates the Doppler shift of\nscattered signals. To do this, we have taken into account not\nonly the spatial-temporal electron density changes, but also\nthe movements of the ionospheric plasma in the scattering\nvolume. The latter is simply solved by the use of the local-\nity principle for the phases (\u03c6) on the moving boundary A\n(Kravtzov, 1980), written as\n\u03c6inc\n\u2223\u2223\nA\n= \u03c6scat\n\u2223\u2223\nA\n.

Bulk movement of\nthe FAIs in the direction of the receiver (St. Petersburg) leads\nto a positive fd in the HF diagnostic signals scattered from\nthese FAIs. When the FAIs are moving in a direction oppo-\nsite to the receiver, the scattered signals have negative val-\nues of Doppler frequency shift (\u2013fd ). Figure 4 presents the\nscheme of the CONE radio channel model algorithm.\nA global ionospheric model was used in the calculations,\ncombining well-known models of the E-, F1- and F2-layers\n(Anufrieva and Shapiro, 1976; Chernyshov and Vasil\u2019eva,\n1975; Bilitza et al., 1992). The input parameter to the iono-\nspheric model is an effective analog of the Wolf numberWeff,\nwhich takes into account not only the solar activity, but the\nmagnetic activity as well (Blagoveshchensky and Borisova,\n1989). The ionospheric model was corrected using real iono-\nspheric data obtained from the EISCAT UHF radar at Troms\u00f8\nand vertical ionospheric sounders located at Kiruna (67.8\u25e6 N;\nT. D.

The spatial resolution\nis 2 degrees in latitude and longitude and 5 km in altitude\nthroughout the ionosphere. The electron density for any co-\nordinates is found using third order spline-functions. The so-\nlution for two-point HF propagation on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8\npath was found by testing exhaustively all elevation and az-\nimuth angles with a resolution of 0.01\u20130.05\u25e6 and 0.1\u20130.5\u25e6,\nrespectively.\nFigure 5 displays an example of the simulation of the ray\ngeometry of diagnostic HF radio-waves scattered from field-\naligned irregularities in the auroral E-region on the London \u2013\nTroms\u00f8 \u2013 St.Petersburg path at 9410 kHz for the geophysical\nconditions on 16 February 1996 at 21:20 UT (Weff = 80).\nFrom Fig. 5 one can see two modes of radio-wave propa-\ngation from London to Troms\u00f8. The first one corresponds\nto one-hop propagation when a diagnostic wave is incident\non the scattering volume over Troms\u00f8 from above. The sec-\nond one is for the radio wave, which comes to the scatter-\ning volume from below after reflection from the F2-layer\nand Earth\u2019s surface. Propagation of the scattered waves from\nTroms\u00f8 to St. Petersburg is also possible on two paths. One\nof them is direct propagation and the other one is propagation\nafter reflection from the ionospheric F2-layer.\nUsing the CONE model, calculations of the Doppler fre-\nquency shifts of scattered signals on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8\n\u2013 St. Petersburg path were performed depending on the di-\nrection of the plasma velocities in the scattering volume for\ndifferent magnitudes of velocity. These results are shown\nin Fig. 6. It is found that the velocity components in the\nnorth-south direction are crucial in determining the Doppler\nfrequency shift values of the scattered signals (see Fig. 6).\nFig. 6. Calculated values of Doppler frequency shift fd versus di-\nrection of plasma velocity for velocities in the range from 200 to\n1000 m\/s on the London - Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path. Calcula-\ntions are made for 9410 kHz and an electron density in the scattering\nvolume in the auroral E-region corresponding to f0Es = 4700 kHz.\n4 Simulation results with moving FAIs\nTo simulate the Doppler frequency shifts of diagnostic HF\nsignals scattered from FAIs in the vicinity of Troms\u00f8 during\nthe experiment on 16 February 1996, real ionospheric move-\nment data were employed. Velocities obtained from EISCAT\nUHF radar measurements and from the digital all-sky imager\n(DASI) at Skibotn have been used.\n4.1 Velocities from EISCAT UHF radar observations\nThe ionospheric plasma velocities from the EISCAT UHF\nradar were observed at an altitude of 278 km with 2-min tem-\nporal resolution. It is assumed that the coupling between\nthe F- and E-regions through the magnetic field lines is per-\nfect, on average (Hanuise et al., 1986). Hence, plasma ve-\nlocities obtained in the F-region may be employed in the\nE-region of the ionosphere. Figure 7 illustrates the simu-\nlation results of Doppler frequency shifts on the London \u2013\nTroms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path for the geophysical conditions\ncorresponding to the experiment on 16 February 1996. The\nplasma velocity vectors, from EISCAT UHF radar measure-\nments on 16 February 1996, between 21:08 and 21:36 UT,\nare shown in Fig. 7a. The calculated Doppler frequency shift\nvalues between 21:08 and 21:36 UT, taking into account only\nelectron density changes in the scattering volume with 2-min\ntemporal resolution, are shown in Fig. 7b. Figure 7c presents\nthe calculated Doppler frequency shifts of the diagnostic HF\nsignals scattered from FAIs in the auroral E-region, taking\ninto consideration plasma velocities from the EISCAT UHF\nradar, as well as electron density changes in the scattering\nvolume.\n1484 T.

Simulation results of Doppler frequency shifts on the Lon-\ndon \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path at 9410 kHz for the geophys-\nical conditions on 16 February 1996, taking into account the real\nionospheric data from EISCAT UHF radar measurements with 2-\nmin temporal resolution: (a) plasma velocity vectors from EISCAT\nUHF radar measurements during the HF pumping experiment on\n16 February 1996; (b) Doppler frequency shifts versus time, tak-\ning into account only electron density changes in the scattering vol-\nume; (c) Doppler frequency shifts versus time, taking into account\nthe plasma velocities given in panel \u201ca\u201d, as well as electron density\nchanges in the scattering volume.\n4.2 Velocities from optical measurements\nIt can be assumed that the movement of FAIs in the scat-\ntering volume at auroral E-region altitudes above Troms\u00f8 is\nconsistent with the movement of the visible aurora. Based on\nthis assumption, a method was developed for finding veloci-\nties from optical data which were then used to calculate the\nDoppler frequency shifts of HF diagnostic signals scattered\nfrom FAIs on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path.\nSimulation results of Doppler frequency shifts (see Fig. 6)\nhave shown that the north\u2013south component of the FAI ve-\nlocities is crucial for bistatic HF scatter measurements on the\nLondon \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path. It is possible to find\nthe north\u2013south component of the FAI velocities from auro-\nral optical data based on DASI keogram data (latitude-time\nplot) shown in Fig. 8a, which shows the luminosity intensity\nat a fixed longitude (19.25\u25e6 E) using geographic latitude-time\nFig. 8.

Initially, smoothed iso-\nlines of equal luminosity were determined. Then the velocity\nwas calculated as a time derivative 1y\/1t , where 1y is the\nchange of latitude (in km) for the same isoline. Figure 8b\npresents the north\u2013south component of velocities obtained\nfrom the DASI keogram. The velocities obtained were in-\ncluded in the calculation of Doppler frequency shift fd on\nthe London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path, which are shown\nin Fig. 8c. There are five Doppler tracks corresponding to\nfive different auroral movements in the DASI keogram dur-\ning the experiment on 16 February 1996 between 21:10 and\n21:35 UT.

The Doppler frequency shift simulation on the Lon-\ndon \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path takes into account not\nonly velocities from the DASI keogram, but also electron\ndensity changes in the scattering volume above Troms\u00f8 as\nwell (Fig. 2).\n5 Comparison between simulation and observations\nFigure 9 shows the comparison between the simulated\nDoppler frequency shifts and experimental dynamic Doppler\nspectra at 9410 kHz on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg\npath during the experiment on 16 February 1996. Doppler\nfrequency shifts calculated on the basis of real velocities ob-\ntained from the EISCAT UHF radar (white solid line), as well\nas from the DASI keogram data (black solid tracks) are over-\nlaid on the experimental observations. Prior to 21:15 UT,\nthere was no similarity between simulated and experimen-\ntal Doppler frequency shifts (see Figs. 1b, 7c and 8c); hence\nthese simulation data are not shown. Figure 9 shows that the\nobserved and simulated results are in satisfactory agreement\nfrom 21:16 to 21:33 UT.\nThe use of ionospheric plasma velocities from the EIS-\nCAT UHF radar at an altitude of 278 km, obtained with 2 min\ntemporal resolution, replicates on the whole the behaviour of\nthe Doppler frequency shifts of the HF diagnostic wave scat-\ntered from FAIs in the E-region, as described by the long-\nlived track (track 1 in Fig. 1b). The best agreement be-\ntween the simulated and observed fd took place from 21:16\nto 21:23 UT. This time interval is characterized by agreement\nnot only in a qualitative sense, but in a quantitative sense as\nwell. Moreover, through that time, the calculated Doppler\nshifts, taking into account the velocities of FAIs obtained by\ntwo different methods, including the EISCAT UHF radar and\nDASI, correspond closely to one another.\nThe velocities in the auroral E-region from the DASI\nkeogram with 10 s resolution adequately describes not only\nthe fine structure of long-lived track 1, but the tracks with\nincreasing negative values of fd during 21:20\u201321:22 UT,\n21:22\u201321:23 UT, and 21:24\u201321:28 UT (tracks 2) as well.\nTrack 2 is in close agreement with the poleward movement\nof the visible auroral forms (see Fig. 8). However, the very\nintense wave-like track (track 3) cannot be explained by the\nDASI velocities. Although the simulated track 3 has wavy fd\nvariations, they are inconsistent with the experimental data of\nDoppler shifts both in phase and amplitude.\nThe heater-induced tracks on the Doppler sonogram\n(tracks 4 and 5) cannot be explained by the CONE model.\nThe burst-like tracks (track 4), appearing when the Troms\u00f8\nHF heater is turned on or off, may be related to the parametric\ndecay instability. Since the CONE model does not take into\naccount effects produced by the gradients of the HF pump\nwave electric field, it cannot explain tracks 4. Likewise,\nheater-induced track 5 also cannot be explained by the CONE\nmodel. There are some grounds to believe that the motion\nof the heater-induced small-scale irregularities in the auro-\nral E-region is not always consistent with the background\nplasma drift. Supporting evidence includes a similar Troms\u00f8\nHF pumping experiment carried out on 17 February 1996 in\nthe nightside auroral ionosphere (Blagoveshchenskaya et al.,\n1998a). During this experiment on the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013\nSt. Petersburg path, the pump wave reflected from a sporadic\nEs layer and well-defined heater-induced Doppler tracks\nwere observed. They were registered only during heater-on\nperiods with small constant Doppler shifts, in spite of the\nfact that the EISCAT UHF radar observations showed large\nvelocities of the background plasma from 500 to 1000 m\/s\nin the north\u2013south direction. This observation provides evi-\ndence that the motion of the heater-induced irregularities in\nthe nightside auroral ionosphere is not always the same as\nthe motion of the background plasma.\nAfter 21:30 UT, scattered diagnostic signals on the\nDoppler sonogram are not observed. A possible reason is that\nthe correct geometry of diagnostic HF radio waves scattered\nfrom FAIs in the auroral E-region is no longer valid. This\ncould be due to a lowering of the FAI altitude from 120 to\n100 km that would lead to the absence of scattered signal re-\nception at St. Petersburg.\n1486 T. D. Borisova et al.: Doppler shift simulation of scattered HF signals\n6 Conclusions\nA model for calculations of parameters of HF radio waves\nscattered from field-aligned small-scale ionospheric irreg-\nularities has been developed. It allows for ray tracing,\ngroup and phase paths, and Doppler frequency shift calcu-\nlations. Comparisons between bistatic scatter measurements\non the London \u2013 Troms\u00f8 \u2013 St. Petersburg path and simula-\ntion results during the Troms\u00f8 HF pumping experiment on\n16 February 1996 from 21:00 to 22:00 UT are made. Doppler\nfrequency shift fd is calculated on the basis of real velocities\nobtained from the EISCAT UHF radar measurements at an\naltitude of 278 km with 2-min temporal resolution, as well as\nfrom the DASI keogram using 10 s resolution data.\nIt was found that the observed and simulated results are\nin satisfactory agreement from 21:16 to 21:33 UT. The best\nagreement took place from 21:16 to 21:33 UT, when the cal-\nculated fd , taking into account velocities obtained from the\nEISCAT UHF radar and DASI keogram, correspond closely\nto one another. The velocities in the auroral E-region from\noptical measurements also describes adequately experimen-\ntal Doppler tracks with increasing negative values of fd as-\nsociated with the poleward movement of the visible auroral\nforms.\nThe developed model cannot explain the heater-induced\nDoppler tracks. On the one hand, it is induced by the fact that\nthe gradients of the HF pump wave electric field are ignored.\nOn the other hand, it may be suggested that the motion of\nthe heater-induced irregularities in the auroral E-region is not\nalways consistent with the background plasma drift.\nIt is planned in future to take proper account of the pump\nwave electric field, the possibility of the excitation of pump-\ninduced Alfve\u00b4n waves and other factors.\nAcknowledgements.
