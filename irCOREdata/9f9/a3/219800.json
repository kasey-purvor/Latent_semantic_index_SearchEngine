The ability of medical teams to develop and maintain team situation awareness \n(team SA) is crucial for patient safety. Limited research has investigated team SA within \nclinical environments. This study reports the development of a method for investigating team \nSA during the ICU round, and describes the results. \nMethods. In one ICU, a sample of doctors and nurses (n=44, who combined to form 37 \ndifferent teams) were observed during 34 morning ward rounds. Following the clinical review \nof each patient (n=105), team members individually recorded their anticipations for expected \npatient developments over 48 hours. Patient outcome data was collected to determine the \naccuracy of anticipations. Anticipations were compared amongst ICU team members, and the \ndegree of consensus was used as a proxy measure of team SA. Self-report and observational \ndata measured team member involvement and communication during patient reviews.  \nResults. For over half of 105 patients, ICU team members formed conflicting anticipations as to \nwhether patients would deteriorate within 48 hours. Senior doctors were most accurate in their \npredictions. Exploratory analysis found that team processes did not predict team SA. However, \nthe involvement of junior and senior trainee doctors in the patient decision-making process \npredicted the extent to which those team members formed team SA with senior doctors.  \nConclusions. A new method for measuring team SA during the ICU round was successfully \nemployed. A number of areas for future research were identified, including refinement of the \nsituation awareness and teamwork measures. \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n3 \nSituation awareness (SA) refers to an individual\u2019s perception of the information within a task \nenvironment, comprehension of its meaning, and anticipation of potential future states 1. When \nmedical and nursing staff perform clinical work together, the development of shared and \naccurate SA between team members (termed team situation awareness) is important for patient \nsafety 2 3. Team SA has been identified as especially important for the ICU due to its reliance on \nmultidisciplinary teamwork and complex patient populations 3-5. In particular, Team SA is \nimportant during daily rounds, a task where ICU teams collaborate to review patients and share \ninformation pertinent to specific roles and care tasks (e.g. daily goals) 6 7. The SA developed \nduring daily rounds will likely influence how team members monitor the patient, prioritise \ntasks, and anticipate urgent events. Teams with mismatching SA for a patient\u2019s condition or \nexpected development are susceptible to enacting uncoordinated and erroneous activities.  \n \nTeam processes related to team members sharing information and perspectives underpin the \ndevelopment of team SA 8-13. Such processes are central to daily rounds; senior doctors lead \ndecision-making through communicating and performing \u201csensemaking\u201d activities to collect \ninformation, diagnose illnesses, and understand potential developments 14-16. Open \ncommunication is important for developing a shared understanding of patient care plans, and \nsenior doctors influence trainee and nursing staff behaviour during the round 7 17-19. This \nresonates with aviation research showing teams with sub-optimal SA to be characterised by \npoor information sharing, and the rejection of junior crew member contributions 9 10 20. Daily \nrounds may support the development of team SA through i) team members perceiving and \nsharing patient information (e.g. diagnosis, physiological data, team member opinions), and ii) \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n4 \nteam members interpreting information to understand patient conditions (influenced by team, \nexperience\/expertise, prior knowledge of patient), and anticipate progression.  \n \nThis article describes the development and trial of a measure of team SA for the ICU round. \nAlthough team SA appears important for patient safety 2 3 21 , real-life healthcare research on \nthis topic is minimal, with team SA being assessed through team observations 22-23. Although \nsuch methods have acknowledged limitations 24, developing non-observational measures of \nteam SA for live environments is highly complex 25. Measurement tools should capture SA as \nteams perform taskwork (without disrupting performance), and then compare SA between team \nmembers. Ideally, SA should be measured against objective situational measures 26. We report \non the results of a feasibility study to test the validity and potential utility of an ICU round-\nspecific team SA measure. Furthermore, we explore team SA theory through investigating the \nrelationship between team processes and team SA during patient reviews.  \n \nMETHOD \n \nSetting and Participants  \nThe study was based in a 16-bed ICU in a UK teaching hospital treating 800 patients per year \n(mean stay 4.8 days), and a 21% ICU mortality rate. A convenience sample of 44 ICU \ncaregivers volunteered to participate, consisting of 7 senior doctors (consultants), 6 senior \ntrainee doctors (specialist registrars), 23 junior trainee doctors (basic speciality trainees), and 8 \nsenior nurses. No demographic information was collected. Data were collected over 3 months. \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n5 \nDue to shift patterns, the 44 participants combined to form 37 different teams (with overlapping \npersonnel). Ethical approval was given by an NHS research ethics committee.   \n \nProcedure \n \nDeveloping a measure of Team SA  \nThe team SA measure was developed with ICU senior physicians and senior nurses and was \nintended to be used immediately after the discussion of a patient during the round. The measure \nassesses team member anticipations for the following four events on a likelihood scale of 0-100 \n27: i) the patient being discharged from the ICU during the next 48hrs (Discharge likelihood); ii) \nthe patient deteriorating during the next 48hrs (Deterioration likelihood); iii) the patient \nremaining on (or requiring) ventilator support during the next 48hrs (Ventilation likelihood), \nand iv) the patient surviving (Survival likelihood). Each anticipated event was designed to be \ncomparable with objective patient outcomes, in order that the ability of team members to \nanticipate future events could be assessed against objective data. For example, discharge, \nventilation and survival likelihood were retrospectively verifiable from ICU clinical audit \nsystems. Deterioration likelihood was determined through the sequential organ failure \nassessment (SOFA) calculation, which is used to track illness severity trajectory 28-31. Compared \nto much of the SA literature, the focus upon anticipations was unusual, but not unique 21 32-35. \nAnticipations were investigated in order to i) develop a standardised SA scale (irrespective of \nspecific pathologies) that allows accuracy to be easily assessed (i.e. by evidence of change), ii) \nmake standardised comparisons between team members\u2019 SA, and iii) avoid priming participant \nattention\/SA by asking them to focus on specific data\/illnesses. In addition, anticipating patient \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n6 \noutcomes is considered important for ICU decision-making, with an established literature \nmeasuring clinical and nursing predictive accuracy 27 36-39.  \n \nSA Data collection \nDuring the daily round, team member SA for each patient was measured immediately at the end \nof the discussion for that patient. Participants recorded their anticipations (using a PDA device \nissued to each team member) for Discharge likelihood, Deterioration likelihood, Ventilation \nlikelihood, and Survival likelihood, alongside their perceived involvement in the patient \ndecision-making process. Structured observations also noted communication events during \npatient reviews, and patient outcome data were collected. Figure 1 outlines the full study \nprocedure, and the section below describes the team observational measures and involvement \nquestion item in greater detail.  \n \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n7 \nMeasuring team process \nAn observational protocol was designed to measure team communication events during each \npatient review (see table 1). Firstly, the number of verbal communications by senior trainee \ndoctors, junior trainee doctors, and senior nurses was noted. Trainee and nursing \ncommunications during ICU rounds often focus on information provision and sharing 18 40 41, \nand higher numbers of verbal communications were expected to indicate greater information \nsharing between team members (potentially enhancing team SA). Secondly, the number of \nprompts by senior doctors for contributions from trainees and nursing staff was noted. These \nwere expected to be significant for developing team SA (e.g. promoting knowledge sharing, \nhighlighting knowledge gaps), and are considered important for developing patient treatment \nplans 42. Communication frequencies (and not content) were noted in order to limit the \nworkload associated with managing both the SA and team data collection process.  \n \nIn addition to the team observations, participants reported their perceived involvement (on a 0-\n100 scale) in the patient decision-making process (involvement). Participants answered the \nquestion using the PDA device immediately after recording their anticipations of patient \ndevelopment. During the round, senior doctors are usually the main decision-makers, and they \ninvolve team members in the decision-making process in order to gather information on patients \n(e.g. from trainees monitoring patients), to share information (e.g. goals), and to educate \ntrainees 7 42 43. Therefore, trainee and nursing involvement during patient reviews may facilitate \nteam SA through i) increasing levels of perspective and information sharing by trainees and \nnursing staff, ii) helping trainees and nursing staff to understand the senior doctor\u2019s goals and \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n8 \ninterpretation of information, and iii) allowing senior doctors to identify and resolve gaps in the \nknowledge\/understanding of team members.  \n \nLastly, observations also noted a number of control variables that might be found to influence \nteam processes or team SA (please see table 1). These included, i) the length of patient review \n(shorter reviews may indicate lower levels of patient complexity, or provide less opportunity for \ninformation sharing), ii) the number of team members attending each patient review (bigger \nteams may reduce opportunities for interactions between team members), iii) the senior doctor \nleading the patient review (senior doctors may have different preferences for involving trainees \nand nurses) 44, and iv) the number of times patient reviews were interrupted (potentially \ndisrupting the flow of conversations and understanding being developed by teams) 45.  \n \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nTeam SA.  \nThe validity and sensitivity of the individual SA measures were assessed in order to consider \ntheir potential for further analysis and development. Firstly, it was expected that the anticipatory \nmeasures would regularly detect instances of shared and divergent team SA (and therefore \ndemonstrate variance). Secondly, it was expected that the measures would be sensitive to \nexpertise, with senior doctors being most accurate in anticipating patient outcomes. Lastly, it \nwas expected that where SA diverged, the anticipations of the majority would be more accurate \nTable 1 \nObservational categories of data collected during patient reviews \nCoding category Definition for observational coding Purpose of measurement \nVerbal communications \nduring the patient review by \nthe senior trainee doctor, \njunior trainee doctor, or \nsenior nurse  \n \n \nThe number of times the senior trainee, junior \ntrainee, or senior nurse  verbally communicated \nduring (and relating to) the patient review.

(In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n10 \nthan the minority. To assess the formation of shared and accurate SA during patient reviews, \ndirections of team member anticipations were compared 46. Where respondents indicated an \nanticipation to be more than 55% likely, the response was classified \u2018likely\u2019. Items rated as less \nthan 45% likely were classified \u2018unlikely\u2019 (This margin was introduced after post-study \ndebriefings found a small number of participants to use the 45-55% range as proxy for \n\u2018uncertain either way\u2019). A team was assessed to have developed shared SA for a patient if all \nteam member\u2019 anticipations for the SA measure were the same (i.e. all \u2018likely\u2019 or \u2018unlikely\u2019). \nTo test SA accuracy, the anticipations of teams and individuals were compared to actual patient \nevents and progress.   \n \nTeam process data. The analysis assessed whether the team process data reflected findings from \nthe ICU team literature showing team member roles and group hierarchies to influence \nteamwork 17 19 44 47. Firstly, it was expected that trainees and nursing staff would report lower \nlevels of involvement in patient decision-making than senior doctors. Secondly, it was expected \nthat when team members were more involved in patient reviews, this would be associated with \nincreased communication events. Finally, it was expected that higher numbers of senior doctor \nprompts for information would be associated with increased team member communications.  \n \nTeam SA and Team Processes. Finally, for the appropriate measures, exploratory analyses \ninvestigate whether team processes measured during the patient review predict the strength of \nteam SA convergence. To measure convergence, we emulated previous team cognition research \n48 49\n and calculated the average squared Euclidian space between team member anticipations of \nlikely patient progression (on the 0-100 scale). Based on the distances between team member \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n11 \nanticipations, a team SA index was calculated. To explore team SA theory on the relationship \nbetween team processes and team SA 2 regression analyses investigate the relationship between \nteam processes and team SA within the ICU team. It is hypothesised that higher levels \ninvolvement, communication, and prompts for information will predict strength of team SA \nconvergence. Furthermore, considering the structure of ICU teams (with senior doctors as \ndecision-makers who share information and delegate tasks\/goals to specific team members 42), a \ndyadic analysis using regression investigates whether the involvement and communication \nbehaviours of trainees and senior nurses predict the degree to which they share SA with the \nsenior doctor (termed sub-team SA).  \n \n \nRESULTS \nA total of 37 ICU teams provided data on 105 patients. Of the patients, 70% survived, 53% \nwere not on ventilation after 48 hours, 36% were discharged after 48 hours, and 47% showed a \ndeterioration in condition within 48 hours. \n \ni) Team SA \nFor each SA item, table 2 shows the percentage of patients for which team members formed \nshared anticipations. Binomial tests found teams to form shared SA more often than chance (all \np < 0.05) for all individual items except deterioration likelihood, which showed greater \nvariance. In addition, Pearson chi-square tests found senior doctors to be more accurate in \nanticipating deterioration likelihood than junior trainees (p < 0.05, with a moderately strong \nCramer\u2019s V effect size of 0.26) and senior nurses (p < 0.05, with a moderate Cramer\u2019s V effect \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.

For items where all team members formed shared SA (n=252), anticipations were \ncorrect for 71% of items. For items where team members did not form shared SA, 77% had a \nsingle team member diverging from the group (senior nurses 31%, senior doctors 27%, junior \ntrainees 25%, and senior trainees 17%). In these cases, the majority grouping was more likely to \nbe correct in their predictions (p < 0.01). When in a minority, senior doctor anticipations were \nincorrect for 58% of items.  \n \nTable 2 \nProportion of patients for which the ICU team formed shared \nanticipations of patient progression, and the accuracy of anticipations \nfor predicting patient outcomes.  \n \nSituation awareness item \n% of patients for which the \nteam formed shared \nanticipations \n% of anticipations accurate for predicting \npatient outcomes (by team member)  \n \n Team member \n \n Senior \nDoctor \nSenior \nTrainee \nJunior \nTrainee \nSenior \nNurse \nDischarge likelihood 64 65 77* 61* 66 \nDeterioration likelihood 45 75* 70 59* 60* \nVentilation likelihood 64 70 67 69 69 \nSurvival likelihood 65 67 65 65 63 \n \n* Significantly different at p < 0.05 \nN \u2264 105 patients \n \nii) Team process data \nA one-way ANOVA found trainees and nursing staff to report lower levels of involvement than \nsenior doctors (p<0.001).

Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n15 \nDISCUSSION \n \nThis study tested a method for measuring team SA during the ICU round, and a number of \ncomments can be made on the results.  \n \nMeasurement of team SA \nThe study measured team SA though focussing upon shared anticipations for aspects of patient \nprogression. More often than chance, ICU teams were found to develop shared anticipations of \ndischarge, ventilation, and survival likelihood. When teams did not form shared SA, a majority \nview was most accurate for predicting patient outcomes. Teams formed shared anticipations of \ndeterioration likelihood for less than half of patients, with senior doctor\u2019 predictions most \naccurate. On reflection, the measures of discharge, ventilation, and survival likelihood had clear \nphysical\/visible outcomes or were dependent upon system factors (e.g. discharge), and were \ntherefore reasonably predictable (e.g. most patients survive ICU). Patient deteriorations may \nhave required greater expertise to predict (and therefore be a more effective measure of SA) as \nthey are subtle (e.g. not physically obvious), measured by a variety of clinical data, can occur \nearly during a patient stay, and are caused by a variety and combination of illness and treatment \nfactors 28-30.  \n \nThe handheld computers were efficient for measuring team SA during the round, and could be \nadapted to handovers processes or pre-operative checks, or focus on anticipations of specific \npatient developments (e.g. sepsis). Notably, despite team members being present during patient \ndiscussions, teams frequently formed different anticipations for patient progression. We cannot \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n16 \nestablish whether this was due to differences in the information perceived (or comprehended) \nduring patient reviews, however it may indicate anticipations to be an alternative diagnostic of \nSA for teams where members have differing roles, knowledge and expertise. Furthermore, it is \nnot possible to demonstrate that team members understood and answered the SA questions \nconsistently. For example, the implications of team members being uncertain or having \nanticipations that agree, but vary in strength, is unclear. This reflects debate on the \nmeaningfulness of comparing team member cognitions 50. The study also found examples of \nteams forming shared and incorrect anticipations of patient progression. This could arise from a \ndominant senior doctor leading opinion, yet it was also notable that senior doctor\u2019 anticipations \nwere incorrect for approximately half of items where they were found to hold divergent \nanticipations to the team. This may highlight the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration \nfor forming accurate shared SA during patient reviews, whilst also pointing towards the \nlimitations of using anticipations of highly complex and uncertain patients to measure team SA.  \n \nTeam processes and team SA \nTeam processes were only found to predict sub-team SA at the dyadic level (between senior \ndoctors and trainees) for deterioration likelihood. Trainee involvement during patient decision-\nmaking processes may help develop sub-team SA through, i) promoting information sharing by  \ntrainees, ii) helping trainees to understand the senior doctor\u2019s goals and to interpret information \nusing the senior doctors expertise, and iii) allowing senior doctors to identify and remedy gaps \nin trainee\u2019 knowledge and understanding. This is consistent with team SA theory in healthcare 2, \nwith strong team SA emerging when team members share information pertinent to roles and \ntasks. Senior doctors report the engagement of trainees as particularly important when \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n17 \ndistributing tasks during the round 42. However, interpretation of the results is restricted due to \nlimitations in the data analysis. The analysis aggregated perceptions of SA to the group level, \nwith each patient treated as an individual data point. Data were collected from 37 unique teams \nwith overlapping team members (e.g. senior doctors and junior trainees), and the non-\nuniformity of data excluded hierarchical linear modelling. Thus, the regression analysis does \nnot test whether certain combinations of team members are particularly proficient at forming \nshared SA. In addition, extraneous variables may have influenced the study, including audibility \nof discussions and underlying patient complexity. These limitations reflect complexities in the \ncollection of team SA data within live healthcare environments. Even within the (relatively) \ncontrolled environment of an ICU ward round, the structure and nature of changing ICU teams, \ncomplex patient profiles, and environmental constraints influence how team SA can be \ncollected and analysed.   \n \nThe team process data reflected findings from the ICU team performance literature 16, with team \nmember involvement during decision-making being influenced by role. Informal post-study \ndiscussions found nurses to report a lack of opportunity\/need to contribute to decision-making, \nand difficulties in finding physical space to be involved. Junior trainees reported feeling \ninvolved when presenting patients, contributing opinions\/information to the decision-making \nprocesses, or participating in the diagnosis of new patients. In addition, junior trainees and \nnursing staff reported \u2018confirming\u2019 patient review outcomes with senior trainees after the round \nif they were unclear on an aspect of patient management. To encourage involvement, senior \ndoctors reported using eye contact, requests for information\/contributions, and temporary \ndelegation of decision-making to senior trainees (who reported high levels of involvement). \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n18 \nWhilst team members agreed their involvement in patient decision-making was important for \nbuilding shared SA, they acknowledged that this was not always possible (e.g. during very high \nworkloads).  \n \nFuture research will use structured qualitative observations to measure team processes, with a \nfocus on specific processes identified as important for team performance. The current study \nfound trainee involvement to contribute to the development of sub-team SA. This was not the \ncase for senior nurses, who reported being the least involved in rounds, and were observed to \nmake limited verbal contributions. Yet, monitoring and anticipatory skills are important for \nnursing practice in both surgical and intensive care teams 21 51 52, and future research should \ninvestigate why team members do not become involved in patient decision-making, and identify \nthe leadership behaviours and team skills that might increase participation. Future SA research \nmay also wish to further identify the shared information requirements of teams, and dyads of \nteam members, for different tasks\/scenarios (i.e. to understand optimal team SA). It may also \ninvestigate why teams develop shared but inaccurate SA during the round, alongside the \nimplications for performance, and methods for re-establishing and maintaining accurate SA. \nThis will allow future studies to explore whether there is a predictive relationship between team \nSA and patient outcomes, and to use team SA as a measure of team performance during the \nround.  \n \nConclusions \n \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B. (In Press). Team situation awareness and the anticipation of patient progress during ICU rounds. BMJ Quality and Safety. \n \n19 \nThis study successfully piloted an experimental method for measuring team SA during the ICU \nround. Further development is required to refine the SA measures, with potential applications to \na number of domains. Furthermore, the research may indicate a need to develop concepts of \nteam SA within healthcare, and to link them with patient outcomes. Research needs to reflect \nthe nature of developing shared SA in hierarchical multidisciplinary teams where training is \nongoing, and team members have different responsibilities, knowledge and experience.  \nReader, T., Flin, R., Mearns, K., & Cuthbertson, B.
