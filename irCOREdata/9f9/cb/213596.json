Hairs may be split in dealing\nwith possible ambiguities, the confusions of conflation, or with potentially illuminating\ndistinctions embodied in all three adjectives.1 Nevertheless historians who have committed\n(albeit as conscripts or collaborators) to this cosmopolitan enterprise in teaching and\nwriting, as well as professional volunteers, find themselves at an intellectual frontier\nunbounded by geographies, hemispheres and continents, let alone national borders and\nparish boundaries. Against the grain of research paradigms established by Von Ranke for\ntheir subject, they are opting to become as resolutely unfettered as modern archaeology\nby disciplinary boundaries, established chronologies and textual traditions for the construc-\ntion of European, American, Indian, Japanese, Chinese or other national histories.2 Their\nconfidence to commit to a contemporary battle between \u2018ancients and moderns\u2019 may be\nreinforced by the existence of a venerable historiographical tradition in the writing of global\nhistory. They might also be reassured by flows of monographs and textbooks, as well as\nseveral professional journals, testifying to the revival of a classical genre that is now clearly\nunderway, and set to continue in the humanities and social sciences. My prolegomenon\nattempts to meet the wishes of the Editors of this journal for some historiographical\nelaboration upon the traditions of an ostensibly, but far from, modern field of history,\nwhich is now expanding in two main directions to meet demands for educated perspectives\non accelerating trends towards the globalization of polities, economies and cultures.\nFirst, and long established for several areas of history and for archaeology, is the model\nof connexions as a traditional and (persistently) persuasive way of writing global history\nthat can be exemplified with reference to the writings of William McNeill. His seminal\nwork has inspired recent programmes of historical investigation into webs of connexions\nacross continents, oceans and countries over very long spans of time. McNeill\u2019s assumption\nis that \u2018encounters\u2019, \u2018contacts\u2019 and above all \u2018connexions\u2019 with \u2018outsiders\u2019 can be represented\nas the origins and engine of most economic, social, political, military, cultural, religious,\ntechnological and other conceivable types of change studied by historians.3 Pursued with\nscholarly detachment, and a proper appreciation of the long chronologies required to\nconstruct histories that aim to select and analyse major forces at work in the evolution of\nhumanity by following McNeill\u2019s recommendations to explore connexions across the gamut\nof political frontiers, spatial units and geographical boundaries of all kinds, historians will\navoid the condescension of cultures, the restrictions of time and the arrogance of nations\n1 Manfred Kossok, \u2018From universal history to global history\u2019, and Bruce Mazlish, \u2018An introduction to global\nhistory\u2019, in Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, eds., Conceptualising global history, Boulder: Westview,\n1993, pp. 1\u201324 and 96\u2013111.\n2 Andrew Sherratt, \u2018Reviving the grand narrative: archaeology and long term change\u2019, Journal of European\nArchaeology, 3, 1, 1995, pp. 139\u201353.\n3 McNeill\u2019s credo is enunciated in William McNeill, \u2018The rise of the West after twenty-five years\u2019, Journal of\nWorld History, 1, 1, 1990, pp. 1\u201321, but see his latest book: John McNeill and William McNeill, The\nhuman web. A bird\u2019s-eye view of world history, New York: Norton, 2004.\n4 j\nj\nP A T R I C K O \u2019 B R I E N\nbuilt into currently dominant styles of history, as well as post-modern incredulities towards\nmeta-narratives of all kinds.4 \u2018Interactions\u2019 could never be simply or even mainly benign.\nFor example, the spread of plagues, diseases and parasites; waves of destructive invasions\nby nomads; wars of conquest, plunder and imperial expansion; forcible conversions to\nalien systems of religious belief; the subversion of indigenous cultures, societies and\ncommunities by strangers, were equally significant, but deplorable, as episodes in global\nhistories of \u2018connexions\u2019.5\nMcNeill\u2019s general approach has clearly been disaggregated into well-specified types of\nconnexion, investigated over long periods of contact maturing into transformations. The\ntaxonomical divisions embodied under that label include: trade, investment, warfare,\nreligion, migrations, diffusions of useful knowledge, botanical exchanges, and the spread\nof diseases. Proper attention has been accorded to the means of transportation and modes\nof communication that secured, facilitated and cheapened contacts by rivers, seas, and\nland, and latterly by air. Once relevant webs of major connexions are traced, understood\nand their significance evaluated, global history will broaden our education. It will provide\nthe spatial and chronological perspectives required for the appreciation of the histories of\nnations, peoples, localities, groups and other factors that the majority of scholars study in\ngreater depth and sophistication, but alas too often detached from potentially illuminating\ncontexts with universal appeal.\nDefined concisely, the second approach to global history extends geographical catch-\nment areas (from the local to more encompassing units) for comparative histories of topics\nthat might be the subject of a study across parish, regional and national boundaries and\nwell as continents, oceans and separable cultures. Although linguistic and scholarly\ncredentials for research in this style of history are extremely difficult to acquire, and the\nskills needed to \u2018make sense\u2019 of contrasts discovered is formidable, the methodological pro-\nblems involved are familiar and similar to those encountered for exercises in comparative\nhistory, conducted within continental, imperial, national or regional frameworks.6\nComparative history helps to surmount the complexity and tyranny of local detail, looks\ninto at least two mirrors, and seeks to offer persuasive answers to the great variety of\nquestions selected for investigation. The inferences derived from the method tend to be\nilluminating when historians concentrate upon well-defined artefacts, institutions,\norganizations, social practices, attitudes and beliefs, which are found in dispersed places,\nand which have already been studied in some depth for particular locations, and which\nexhibit comparable, but, more importantly, dissimilar geographical, economic, political\nand social features in other places. Then, as Marc Bloch anticipated, the \u2018comparative\nmethod can elicit from the chaotic multiplicity of circumstances those contrasts which\nwere generally effective\u2019, or as Ka\u00a8ren Wigen recently observed: \u2018Only in a dialogue with\n4 Jerry Bentley, \u2018Myths, wagers and some moral implications of world history\u2019, Journal of World History, 16,\n1, 2005, pp. 51\u201382.\n5 Alfred Crosby, Ecological imperialism: the biological expansion of Europe, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1986, and Patrick Manning, \u2018The problem of interactions in world history\u2019, American\nHistorical Review, 101, 3, 1996, pp. 771\u201383.\n6 Charles Ragin, The comparative method: moving beyond qualitative and quantitative strategies, Berkeley:\nUniversity of California Press, 1987; Charles Tilly, Big structures, large processes, huge comparisons, New\nYork: Russell Sage Foundation, 1984; R.

It has already generated a bibliography of global histories concerned with:\neconomic development, gender, the family, youth, marriage, diet, housing, health, military\norganization, government, slavery, human rights, parliaments, nationalism, religions,\nfundamentalism, revolutions, and so forth.10\nAs exemplars of comparative histories in printed form multiply it seems difficult to\nconceive of any theme that currently attracts attention from scholars engaged in writing\nnational and local histories that could not be repositioned within wider geographies and\nlonger temporal periods. My claim requires no emphasis for historians confronting the\nvariety of biospheres and ecologies around the globe, which form essential prefaces for\nany analysis of contrasts in the histories of political institutions, social arrangements,\ncultures, demographic change and material progress observed for the enlarged areas of\nthe world now under investigation. Attention to environments is promoting a reunification\nof history with geography, simply because variations in ecological conditions often turn\nout to be such a fundamental part of any persuasive explanation for contrasts in ways\nand in standards of living, both between and within the West and the Rest.11 Tendencies\nendemic to academic specialization to treat the natural world either as a mere preface, or\nof negligible significance for the political, social, economic and cultural histories of nations,\nnow seem truncated and myopic. Fortunately, renewed concern with the evolution of\nhuman interactions with nature attracts biologists, geologists, botanists, climatologists,\npalaeontologists and epidemiologists into history. Their deeper comprehension and, latterly,\nthe modern modes they have adopted for the lucid communication of scientific knowledge\npertaining to these all-important connexions, are being fed back into history.

That is why the integration of its empirically validated theories\nand insights into long-neglected connexions between human and natural histories has\nbecome widely accepted as a necessary basis for comparative history on global and more\nlocal scales.13\nComparisons and connexions have dominated the flow of publications that have marked\nthe restoration of global history to university and school curricula in humanities and\nthe social sciences. Pursued with sensitivity both styles should deepen understanding of dif-\nference and diversity; meet the demand for perspective from those trying to comprehend\naccelerated trends towards interdependence and integration on a global scale and above\nall, allow for less ethnocentric appreciations of the manifold achievements of more peoples,\ncommunities and cultures over long spans of human history.14 As this survey shows, that\naspiration has some way to go, after centuries of Eurocentric, Sinocentric and Islamocentric\ntraditions traced by historiographers.\nEurope\u2019s historiographical traditions\nGlobal histories have been written since Herodotus (495\u2013425 BCE), whose cosmopolitan\nconcerns were commended by Cicero. However, Thucydides (471\u2013400 BCE) thought\nGreeks had no business investigating alien mythologies, religions, customs and traditions.\nHistory writing, he suggested, should be modelled upon his own study of the\nPeloponnesian War\u2014sharper in focus, shorter in time horizons, based upon verified facts\nand prescriptive rather than descriptive in its purposes.15 Fortunately Herodotus had\nignored such \u2018Eurocentric\u2019 concerns, and had ranged widely beyond the Hellenic world to\ninclude Egypt, India, Babylonia, Arabia and Persia in his histories in order, as he put it,\nto \u2018preserve the memory of the past by placing on record the astonishing achievements of\nboth our own and of the Asiatic peoples\u2019.16 Herodotus used oral testimony and\narchaeological remains, as well as written sources. He made serious attempts to impose\nsome chronology and order on streams of events that had occurred on three continents\nover long spans of time. His (still popular) book ends in \u2018European triumphalism\u2019 and\nturns into a celebration of the victories of the Greek polis (led by Athens) over the Persian\nEmpire, which Herodotus (with appropriate irony) represented as a conflict between\nOccident and Orient, freedom and despotism, civilization and barbarism.17 Global\nhistorians will applaud Herodotus for the scale, scope and empathy of his histories; his\nreflexive interest in barbarian virtues as well as Greek vices; and regret the long hiatus\n12 Robert Denemark, ed., World system history.

However, many Christian chroniclers\nconsidered that \u2018pagan\u2019 events mattered only because they hinted at something more\nmeaningful in the future, so that events unconnected by earthly cause and effect were\nlinked by God\u2019s plan in a kind of \u2018figural\u2019 history.26 In 1158 Bishop Otto of Freising\n18 Ken Pomeranz suggested that \u2018one can read Herodotus in a less triumphalist vein (which would make him\neven more the father of global history)\u2019.

Turkish armies crossed into the Balkans in 1350, took Constantinople in\n1453 and menaced Vienna as late as 1683.32 For nearly a thousand years after the fall of\nRome, Christendom braced its defences, imported useful knowledge and shaped its collec-\ntive identity with help from historians, who composed ideologically charged narratives in\ncontexts of conflicts (and encounters) with the powerful civilization of Islam on all its fron-\ntiers.33 Memoirs, travelogues, diplomatic correspondence and investigations into Arabic\nmedicine, astronomy and mathematics, together with commercial intelligence on societies\nunder Ottoman dominion, flowed from east to west. Much of this information came\nthrough Genoa, Florence and Venice, along with spices, herbs, sugar, botanical drugs, jew-\nels, chinaware, silks, cottons and elaborated metal goods, imported through the Middle\nEast, from India, Southeast Asia and China.34 However, the increasing knowledge of other\nplaces rarely entailed investigations into their histories.\nFor centuries before the symbolic date of 1492, the expense of procuring exotic and\ndesirable luxuries, moving slowly overland and subject to tolls and extortionate charges\nfor protection along the way, prompted Europeans to try to surmount the barriers to direct\ncommerce with South Asia and the Far East maintained by their Islamic enemies. Following\nthe Portuguese conquest of Ceuta in 1415, and subsequent expeditions in search of gold\nand slaves down the coast of Africa, came the voyages of discovery. Europeans at last\nbroke out of their political, economic and mental encirclement by Islam, moving into the\nlong-connected maritime world of Afro-Asian commerce across the Indian Ocean and into\n27 Beryl Smalley, Studies in medieval thought and learning, London: Hambledon Press, 1981, p. 53, and Chris\nGiven-Wilson, Chronicles.

European histories of the world became not only wider and deeper, but also\nmore reflexive, as scholarship took over space from propaganda, sycophancy, fantasy,\nreligion and dynastic ideologies.39\nFor something like half a century before the French Revolution and the colonization\nof South and Southeast Asia, European historians published narratives of enlighten-\nment that resituated Europe\u2019s and Christendom\u2019s place in world history by including ancient\nand classical Mediterranean civilizations, and by widening their gaze to take in China,\nIndia, Japan and Islamdom, as well as the recently rediscovered Americas. Europe\u2019s promis-\ning \u2018school\u2019 of world historians, which reached its apogee at Go\u00a8ttingen in the early years of\nthe nineteenth century, also dealt with the natural histories, the religions and above all the\nethnographies of most parts of an increasingly interrelated universe.40\n35 Kirti Chaudhuri, Asia before Europe.

Bernier, Montesquieu, Defoe,\nWinckelman and Hume, among others, remained resolutely unimpressed with Chinese\ncivilization.41 Nevertheless historians of that era covered cultures, geographies and spans\nof time that their modern counterparts can only envy, confronted as they are with a much\ngreater volume of professional knowledge and interpretation than anything included in\nearlier reports conveyed by missionaries, mariners and merchants.\nAlas, the ironic reflexion and serious debate that historians of the Enlightenment period\nbrought to the task of repositioning Europe in a secular history of the world came to\nbe overshadowed by two centuries of Western triumphalism. In the aftermath of the\nRevolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1789\u20131815, Europeans acquired massive additions\nto the populations, territories and natural resources in Asia, the Pacific and Africa under\ntheir direct or informal control. During an \u2018imperial meridian\u2019 European naval and\nmilitary superiority over the states and societies of other continents emerged as virtually\nirresistible.42 European settlers escaped from earlier metropolitan restraints upon the\npursuit of wealth in new worlds, and were free to exploit natural resources and native\nworkforces in other continents under rules of their own making, tempered only by\nreligion and the paternalism of some colonial regimes.43 Around the same time, Western\nEurope moved clearly onto a trajectory for sustained and accelerated economic growth,\nwhich led to widening divergences in levels of technology, productivity, living standards\nand military prowess between East and West, North and South.44\nAt this conjuncture in world history a majority of European intellectuals returned to the\nintrospective attitude of Rome. Those who looked beyond Europe either wrote imperial\nhistories, or displayed versions of cultural arrogance exemplified by the views of\nHegel. He maintained that only peoples who \u2018form a state\u2019 or have \u2018reached a certain level\nof spiritual development have a history\u2019, and that \u2018the history of the world travels from East\nto West, for Europe is absolutely the end of history, and Asia the beginning\u2019.45 \u2018Eurocentric\u2019\ntraditions in the construction of global histories intersected with theories of social develop-\nment that followed from the American, French and Industrial Revolutions. They clarified,\nand purported to explain, Europe\u2019s geopolitical, technological and economic hegemony\nover the rest of the world.46 Teleological conceptions of human progress and stages of\nhistory were venerable. They were latent in Christian concepts of time and change,\nand had been immanent in the writings of Montesquieu, Leibniz and Condorcet and\nothers before Hegel.

Theories formulated by this famous line of intellectuals exemplify a tradition in the\nhistory of European thought that posits that social evolution is natural and immanent in a\ncivilization, country, region, society or other unit under consideration, even when it may\nbe punctuated by recognized interludes of stasis or regression.48 History exhibits\ntrends that are directional and necessary for the realization of some pre-selected\noverarching goal: equilibrium rates of population growth in the anxieties of Malthus; the\nspirit of universal freedom embraced by Hegel; democratic institutions seen (however\nambivalently) as the wave of the future by Tocqueville; Saint Simon\u2019s technocracy;\nuniversal scientific knowledge in the vision of Comte; individual liberty as extolled by\nMill; the classless society predicted by Marx; and the rationalities detected by Weber in his\ncomparisons across civilizations.\nAll generalizations about the history of the Orient were, however, based on scanty\ninformation. Malthus had virtually no access to censuses of population from anywhere in\nthe East.49 Saint Simon knew as much about Chinese technology as Comte did about\nthe empire\u2019s scientific traditions. For what they were worth, Hegel, Tocqueville and\nMill probably took their cues about the origins and nature of oriental despotism from Jesuit\nmissionaries, or second-hand from Montesquieu and Hume.50 Marx and Engels invented an\nAsiatic mode of production.51 Spencer bowdlerized Darwin and unwittingly provided\nracists with that infamous pseudo-scientific label \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019.52 Weber tried to\nanalyse the Geist animating the evolution of European, Hindu and Chinese civilizations, a\ntask that turned out to be way beyond the capacities of a single scholar, even a man with\nhis awesome erudition.53 All of them came up with reasons why interludes of progressive\nchange outside the West degenerated into stasis.\nEndeavouring to comprehend the motors and forces making for such change, most\nhistorians retained antipathies to over-generalized explanations, but at the same time they\nimported (some say internalized) vocabularies, taxonomies and theories from philosophy,\n47 Robert Nisbet, Social change and history.

They worked with varying degrees of detachment (most implicitly, but\nsome formally employed) in the service of nation states.55 By the late nineteenth century,\nEuropean scholars (including Ranke, Lavisse, Acton, and Beer) began to construct multi-\nvolume histories of the world. Alas Acton\u2019s Cambridge modern history remained infused\nwith the assumptions, metaphors, taxonomies and theories of European social science.56\nErnest Lavisse and Alfred Rambaud edited a twelve-volume Histoire Ge\u00b4ne\u00b4rale (1893\u2013\n1901) that devoted only a tenth of its pages to the non-Western world.57 Henry Buckle\nwrote a three-volume history of \u2018civilization\u2019 with reference to England and was entirely\nfrank about his assumption that civilization could be \u2018broken into two vast divisions\u2019: the\nEuropean division in which \u2018Man is more powerful than Nature and the non-European\ndivision, in which Nature is more powerful than Man\u2019.58\nThe controversy over Lamprecht\u2019s ambition to write less Eurocentric and more\nuniversal cultural histories shows that his programme aroused the kind of ire from his\nhighly professional colleagues in Germany that Thucydides had directed at Herodotus\nmany centuries before.59 Apart from the exemplary endeavours of Lamprecht and Weber,\naspirations to write cosmopolitan, secular and truly universal histories only survived\namong a handful of isolated and now forgotten European scholars who eschewed the con-\ndescensions embodied in Western science, technology, social science, liberalism, colonialism\nand religion. They continued to write outside the encompassing national and imperial\nframeworks associated with the geopolitical hegemony of Europe.60\nMost European historians left the detailed study of spaces, populations, polities\nand societies constituting most of the world to colonial administrators, missionaries,\nphilologists, geographers and anthropologists, who, to their credit, produced volumes of\nuseful evidence that is now being reconfigured into modern global history.61 Groups of\neminent historians from the universities of imperial powers limited themselves to\n54 Arif Dirlik, \u2018History without a center?

He also drew attention \u2018to\nthe remarkable dearth of historical writing in the period down to the first millennium\nA.D\u2019.79 Hindu kingdoms did, nevertheless, maintain elaborate records and genealogies.\nMoreover, annals and a wide range of Indo-Islamic historical writing, drawing upon Arab\nand Persian models, developed under the patronage of Mughal courts.80 Despite their\nlocation at the centre of an ancient Afro-Asian trans-oceanic system of commerce and the\nlocus of a universal religion (Buddhism) before the intrusion of Europeans, \u2018Indians,\nespecially Hindus, never displayed a deep interest in writing historically, nor until it could\nbe used as propaganda against their British imperial rulers did they find hard history to be\na reliable, ethical or reasonable way of constructing the past\u2019.81 Here Nandy neglects\nPersian and Islamic traditions in writing histories of the sub-continent. His statement may\n(as the Arab geographer, al-Biruni, suggested as long ago as the year 1000) reflect feelings\namong Indians that they had no need to refer to history (or to geography and travelogues)\nto retain possession of superior knowledge about themselves and the rest of an Asian\nuniverse that they knew so well.82 Perhaps they lacked curiosity about their origins and\nhow their sophisticated civilization changed over time.83 Yet even before the collapse of the\nMughal Empire and its takeover by Britain at the end of the eighteenth century, Hindu and\nMuslim intellectuals had begun to historicize and explain the decadence of that Empire.84\nThe observation by a Hindu poet in 1888 that \u2018no moon of history is to be seen\nin the pure sky of India\u2019 seems to be hyperbole.85 Although that notion originated from\n77 David Birmingham, \u2018History in Africa\u2019, in Bentley, Companion to historiography, pp. 692\u2013708.

Thus whole libraries of books, largely\nuntranslated, include: chronicles, annals, genealogies, biographies of rulers, officials, scho-\nlars, military men, virtuous women and collections of statues, edicts, and other official\ndocuments, as well as a smaller range of scholarly monographs on such topics as calendars,\nastronomy, geography and economic life.91\nThough history and biography were supposed to aid in making moral and political judg-\nments, scholars writing Chinese and Japanese history could be punished by their rulers for\nthe insertion of \u2018politically incorrect\u2019 assessments.92 Dynastic and other cycles, rather than\nanticipations of progress, dominated the ordering of time and chronologies in East Asian\nthought.93 By the seventh century Chinese history had acquired an official status below\nthe classics and above non-canonical philosophical texts and literature. Historians served\nthe purposes of the empire in three ways. Firstly they provided precedents for policies\npromoted by emperors and shoguns. Secondly, the records and annals of governance that\nthey edited contained lessons in statecraft (jingshi) for officials.94 Thirdly, they compiled\nstylized biographies of the great, the good and the bad that inculcated morality (baobian)\namong the emperors, officials and, above all, their subjects, so that \u2018the writing of history\n86 Ibid. p. 277.\n87 Dipesh Chakrabarty, Provincializing Europe.

How to incorporate\nthese peoples into their sense of identity and history was among the early problems con-\nfronted by Han Chinese rulers. With difficulty, that was accomplished by redefining subju-\ngated societies as Chinese, and also by affirming that nomadic dynasties from Mongolia and\nManchuria that had conquered the empire had thereby secured mandates to become rulers\nof China. Provided that conquering aliens recognized Chinese culture and codes of beha-\nviour as superior to their own indigenous, political, social, religious, and moral beliefs,\nthey could be assimilated into the Celestial Empire. In short, China was constructed,\nextended, sustained and ruled for some centuries on the basis of a cultural and not an ethnic\ndefinition of its core identity.96\nThat basic belief in acculturation gradually permeated the views of Chinese intellectuals\nwho investigated and wrote about the geographies, ethnographies and histories of all other\ncommunities and polities located beyond the borders of the Empire.97 In so far as Chinese\nhistorians considered states and societies outside China, until well into the nineteenth cen-\ntury they conceived of a world hierarchically ordered in sinocentric terms. They invariably\nassumed that, by virtue of its superior civilization, China stood at the centre and apex of the\nuniverse, and that its emperor enjoyed a mandate from heaven not only to rule the empire,\nbut also to exact deference and tribute from all other peoples known and unknown to the\nChinese.98 Over the centuries, by way of military conquest, commerce and exploration,\nthe Chinese maintained an extensive web of contacts and connexions initially with peoples\nlocated close to the frontiers of the empire (Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, Mongols,\nManchus, Turks and Tibetans), and, long before the establishment of regular trading links\nwith Iberian merchants in the sixteenth century, with Indonesia, Thailand, India, Burma\nand societies as far away as East Africa and West Asia.99 Along with their Greek,\nRoman, Christian and Islamic counterparts, Chinese ethnographers and historians classified\npopulations outside their \u2018Middle Kingdom\u2019 as \u2018barbarians\u2019. Nevertheless, their own imper-\nial tradition of acculturation led to a politically expedient recognition that some peoples\ncould be more civilized, or less barbaric, than others. Predictably that recognition was\nmore readily accorded to an inner zone of neighbouring polities and peoples (Japan, Korea,\n95 Ku, Baobian and Jingshi, p. 339.\n96 Alastair Johnston, Cultural realism, strategic culture and grand strategy in Chinese history, Princeton:\nPrinceton University Press, 1995.

In that case they have\na Chinese heart and mind\u2019.102 In Japan, an autonomous Asian kingdom with a sinicized\nculture, this sinocentric Weltanschauung continued to be accepted by most scholars until\nthe late eighteenth century. Tokugawa historians then began to construct a mythical past\nand discover Japanese sages, in order to help Japan to effect the transformation from\nbarbarian satellite to divine realm, replacing China at the apex of a hierarchy of Asian\nstates. This status Japan eventually, albeit briefly, attained by invading China in 1937 and\nchallenging the West to a disastrous military conflict.103\nThe most significant other historiographical tradition to interrogate is Islamic. No statis-\ntician has added up the cumulating stock of pages devoted to history through time and\nacross cultures before the era of Voltaire. However, the amount, range and depth of litera-\nture that could be represented as historical, written by Muslims for Muslims in Arabic, Per-\nsian and Ottoman, may well have exceeded the total amount available to Europeans in\nLatin and secular languages, or to East Asians in Chinese.104 Indeed, it is prima facie sur-\nprising that Islam\u2019s tradition in writing history did not evolve in more ecumenical directions,\ngiven the vast expanse of territory and the sheer scale and variety of populations conquered\nby Islamic armies. An extensive range of ethnic communities, traditional societies and poli-\ntical systems were converted to Islam\u2019s religious and moral codes and living under its insti-\ntutions. More than a millennium of connexions with other civilizations occurred, whether\nthrough commerce and warfare, or through the intermediation of Jewish, Christian and\nother minorities under Islamic rule.105\nConsidered as a store of written records that continues to provide a great deal of reliable\nevidence and contemporary opinion, that tradition seems in form and scale as impressive as\nanything produced by European, Chinese or Japanese scholars. For example, it includes all\nthe familiar genres styles and epistemologies: annals, court chronicles, accounts of battles,\nbiographies of Caliphs and other rulers, and prosopographies of ulama, lawyers, teachers\nand other people. It also contains documents and records pertaining to the histories of\nseparable provinces, cities and localities included within an expanding civilization defined\nby adherence (or deference) to a universal religion.106\nAlthough there is some history from below and a sprinkling of thematic monographs,\nIslamic historiography is dominated by narratives of its classical period, by the words and\n100 Richard Smith, Chinese maps: images of all under heaven, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996.\n101 Masayuki Sato, \u2018Imagined peripheries.

They established critical methods to ascertain validity for the hadith (the deeds\nand sayings of the Prophet and his companions), and by extension, the plausibility of evi-\ndence required to reconstruct more secular and political pasts as accurately as possible,\nbut always within the constraints allowed by religious and political orthodoxies of their\ntimes and locations.108\nFor centuries, the writing of Islamic history for every part of the world fell under the\ncontrol (or regulation) of ecclesiastical and political authorities. In the Dar al-Islam\n\u2018historiography and historians held a place within a cultural establishment designed by\nand for lawyers\u2019.109 Guardians of sacred texts and legal precedents, the ulama (jurists), as\nwell as political authorities preferred histories that concentrated on the classical and\nglorious era of foundation, imperial expansion, and the Caliphates, providing cases for\nstatecraft and drawing moral lessons (adab) from the lives of celebrated caliphs, warriors,\nclerics, lawyers and scholars.110 Except briefly under the first caliphs, Islam was neither a\nplace nor a polity, but a widespread ecumenical community marked off from the rest of\nthe world by a religion, by adherence to moral and legal codes and to similar frameworks\nof political, legal, social and economic institutions, inspired by principles set out in a\nsacred book.\nFor roughly a thousand years between the times of Muhammad and the siege of Vienna\nin 1683, Islamdom (which included Arab, Persian, Turkic and other empires) expanded its\ninfluence and power through conquest and conversion. Despite setbacks, vicissitudes and\ncycles of contraction, it extended its hold over territories, societies and populations in\nAfrica, the Balkans, Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. It even penetrated\nthroughout China, although its military victories there were early, fleeting and periph-\neral.111 While the Pyrenees stood for centuries as Islam\u2019s notional frontier with Western\nEurope, the location, direct connexions and contacts with the rest of the world maintained\nfor centuries by Muslims placed their intellectuals (including converts from other cultures)\nin a unique position to acquire geographic, ethnographic, cultural, political, technological\nand economic knowledge about the rest of the known world, and to construct universal his-\ntories, long before Christians embarked on their voyages of discovery and process of imper-\nial expansion.112\n107 Chase Robinson, Islamic historiography, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.\n108 Tarif Khalidi, Arabic historical thought in the classical period, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1994.\n109 Bernard Lewis, \u2018The use by Muslim historians of non-Muslim sources\u2019, in Bernard Lewis and Peter Holt,\neds., Historians of the Middle East, London: Oxford University Press, 1961, pp. 180\u201391.\n110 Robinson, Islamic historiography, pp. 180\u201391.\n111 Marshall Hodgson, The venture of Islam: conscience and history in a world civilization, 3 vols., Chicago:\nChicago University Press, 1974.\n112 Richard Eaton, \u2018Islamic history as global history\u2019, pp. 1\u201336.\n20 j\nj\nP A T R I C K O \u2019 B R I E N\nIn the event, there is a rather short list of books by Muslim authors who should appear\nin any historiographical survey of global history.113 That list would begin with a Persian his-\ntorian, Tabari (839\u2013923), whose History of Prophets and Kings starts with Adam, moves\nthrough thirteen volumes of annals, across several ancient civilizations, to the times of the\nProphet.114 His contemporary Ya\u2019qubi (an Armenian bureaucrat working for the ruler of\nIran) commences his world history with \u2018Iraq because it is the centre of the world, the\nnavel of the earth\u2019.115 Ya\u2019qubi\u2019s erudite combination of geographical and ethnographic\ndetail recognized several great pre-Islamic civilizations (China, India, Black Africa, the\nBerbers, Byzantium and Persia), a diversity of God\u2019s peoples and regions interacting from\nbiblical times to diffuse their particular contributions to civilization to produce, at the end\nof history, the Abbasid Caliphate.116\nSix decades later the forerunner of the more famous Ibn Khaldun, Mas\u2019udi, wrote his\nMeadows of Gold and other books of \u2018panoramic sweep\u2019, exemplifying a \u2018sustained interest\nin philosophy, theology, geography, medicine, astronomy, meteorology and zoology\u2019. As a\n\u2018preamble to the study of history\u2019 (for which he makes precocious and heartwarming\ncosmopolitan claims), Mas\u2019udi was \u2018the first Arab Muslim historian to apply principles of\nscientific methods and philosophic reasoning to the study of history\u2019. He accorded\nserious attention to civilizations that preceded Islam and even recognized the virtues of\nFranks and Slavs. His reasons for the decline of kingdoms, nations and cultures were blind\nimitation, the neglect of research and inquiry, political fragmentation, and persistent\nrelapses into errors and obscurantism that he feared might overtake his own religion and\nculture.117\nMas\u2019udi did not inaugurate an intellectual tradition of world history, but his aspirations\nwere certainly followed by two other great Muslim historians, Rashid ad Din (1247\u20131318)\nand Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406). Rashid, a Jewish convert to Islam, wrote a history of the\npeoples conquered by or in contact with the Mongols (for the then Mongol ruler of\nPersia). He consulted Chinese scholars about their empire, a Buddhist hermit from\nKashmir on India, and an Italian nuncio concerning the \u2018barbarians\u2019 of Western Europe.\nHe also made good use of the extant bibliography in Persian and Arabic. Although his\naccount of the West is regarded as \u2018flimsy and superficial\u2019 in scope and method, compared\nwith the sections on Islam, India and China, this work, written for Mongol, Persian and\nArab readers, deserves the degree of attention that has been accorded to Ibn Khaldun,\nwhose Muqaddima explaining the long-term causes of social change has become classic in\nhistorical sociology.118 Ibn Khaldun included a geographical survey of Western Europe,\nand recognized that God had allowed the Franks to engage with science and learning as\nwell as futile Crusades against Islam.

Like their Christian foes,\nMuslim historians concentrated overwhelmingly on the construction of histories for and\nabout the Islamic umma (community), and especially its ruling elites. Outside Islam they\nobserved lands and peoples (infidels in the Dar al-Harb, the land of war) whose interest\nto them, their patrons and the faithful were in large part as settings for conquest and\nconversion.121 \u2018At the level of narrative, pre-Islamic history is recast in Islamic terms and\nIslamic history is patterned upon monotheistic history. What happened outside the\nCaliphate (and by extension the umma) might have been of some interest to the curious,\nbut information was necessarily scarce. Besides, why should it have a sure place in the\nhistoriographical vision if God had not made it part of His order by sending successful\narmies to conquer it?\u2019122\nIt would be difficult to maintain that Muslim historians displayed any singular lack of\ncuriosity about, or contempt for, the world outside Dar-al-Islam. For several centuries,\nMuslim intellectuals seem to have been understandably more interested in China, India,\nPersia, and Byzantium than in Western Europe, despite the range and strength of\nconnexions with their Catholic foes. Their weak knowledge of European languages\nrepresented a barrier to understanding. They largely relied on indigenous minorities,\nrenegades and converted slaves to act as intermediaries for commercial and diplomatic\ntransactions. These people also translated the necessary military, technical and scientific\nknowledge, and supplied materials for the historical myths and distorted Christian\ntheology that was deployed in diatribes across the divides between two virulently hostile\nand mutually antagonistic religions.123\nExchanges of geographical, ethnographic, commercial, political and historical knowl-\nedge between Islam and Christendom improved after the fall of Constantinople, which led\nto the consolidation of Ottoman power on Europe\u2019s frontiers. According to Bernard Lewis,\nwho has reviewed both literatures, the knowledge (including historical knowledge) about\nMuslim culture in general, and the Ottoman Empire in particular, that was available\nand accessible to initially anxious, and by the late seventeenth century more militant and\nself-interested, Europeans, became markedly superior to anything available to their Arab\nand Turkish rivals for religious, economic and geopolitical hegemony.

Au contraire, a case could be made for periods and exam-\nples of Western enlightenment that might be represented as less \u2018centric\u2019 than anything\nfound in histories either from Islam or, less surprisingly, from China.\nIt was only after that profound conjuncture in world history from 1783\u20131825 that\nhistoriographies from all parts of the world, in interestingly different ways and degrees,\nbecame preoccupied with the geopolitical, technological and political rise of the West,\nand with occasionally using comparative studies to see how to escape from its all-\npowerful embrace.125 This truly massive disturbance to what had been for millennia\nmulti-polar balances of wealth, political power and claims to cultural superiority, came to\nmaturity rather abruptly. It intensified decade after decade, and influenced not only the\nthemes and problems selected for investigation by scholars engaged in writing histories\nfrom all parts of a globalizing world, but conditioned their methods and epistemological\nassumptions as well.126\nParadoxically historians from Western Europe, entranced with a sense of modernity,\nprogress and superiority over the rest of the world, became better informed, but at the\nsame time more introverted and less curious about other cultures and traditions than they\nhad been when Ottoman armies threatened the integrity of Christendom, and when\nEuropean merchants lacked the naval power and competitive advantages required to shift\nthe gains from commerce with the Middle East, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, China and\nJapan in their favour.127 Of course, very few historians had ever detached their writings\nfrom the epistemes of their times. If anything, European positions became more situated\nduring an age of progress when influential reflexions from prestigious intellectuals upon\nthe contexts for the emergence and achievements of science, technology, philosophy, forms\nof governance, institutions, social science, law, art, architecture\u2014even languages for\ncommunication and clarification\u2014came to be represented as quintessentially Western.\n124 Lewis, Muslim discovery of Europe, pp. 142 and 184.\n125 Christopher Bayly, The birth of the modern world, Oxford: Blackwell, 2004.\n126 Fuchs and Stuchtey, eds., Across cultural borders.\n127 Ju\u00a8rgen Osterhammel, \u2018Peoples without history\u2019, and Kirti Chaudhuri, Asia before Europe.\nT H E R E S T O R A T I O N O F G L O B A L H I S T O R Y j\nj\n23\nMost made scant references to prior contributions from peoples living outside a hitherto\nunremarkable promontory on the edge of Eurasia.\nFor many fields of intellectual enquiry in the physical and social sciences which are \u2018a\u2019\n(if not \u2018anti\u2019) historical, a provincial and foreshortened approach to the comprehension of\nnature and society is explicable, but for historians proclaiming it to be their distinctive\nmission to supply wider and longer perspectives, such myopia can be denigrated as\nEurocentric.128 Yet generations of otherwise erudite scholars failed to question the epistemic\ncultural assumptions of their age and concentrated upon investigations into the origins\nof their own \u2018constructed\u2019 civilization, supposedly unique and homogeneous. Despite\nan overwhelming flow of information and evidence about the rest of the world from\ncolonial, diplomatic, commercial and academic sources (largely of an ethnographical,\nanthropological and archaeological kind), the spatial parameters for historical investigations\ninto webs of connexions and for illumination derivable from cross-cultural or international\ncomparisons, histories of the world continued to be contained within the boundaries of\na premier league of European nations\u2014evolving, under the umbrella of American\nhegemony and power, into the West.129\nOf course, the minority of historians who did engage with European expansion, empires\noverseas, and with area studies, could hardly avoid widening their spatial horizons and\ndeepening the chronological time spans to include Islamdom, South and Southeast Asia\nand eventually Africa.130 Western and imperial historians who wrote \u2018scientific\u2019 histories\nof Indian, Chinese, Arab, Ottoman, Japanese and African pasts, specified the questions,\ninterrogated the sources, and offered interpretations in large measure predicated upon\nthe theories, methods, taxonomies, vocabularies (even the vernacular and mathematical\nlanguages) established for European social sciences.131\nThey taught students from overseas\u2014many native to metropolitan colonies\u2014how to\nresearch and write histories about \u2018peoples without a history\u2019.132 The education on offer\nsuppressed indigenous ways of knowing the past and invariably included as the standard\nfor reference a mythical construction of Europe\u2019s own evolution from the continent\u2019s\nHellenistic origins, through Rome to Western Christendom, and on through Renaissance,\nReformation and Enlightenment to the nineteenth century. By then, Europe had\nclearly achieved the range of military, political, organizational, scientific, technological,\ncommercial, economic, and (by assertion) moral and cultural modernities exhibited on\nurban sites in every part of the world.133\nChristians had traditionally proclaimed their moral superiority over Islam, Hinduism,\nBuddhism, Confucianism and other systems of thought for centuries, but a secularized\nChristianity, allied with advanced technologies and power, turned out to be impossible to\n128 Amin, Eurocentrism, and Blaut, Colonizer\u2019s model of the world.\n129 Michael Bentley, \u2018Approaches to modernity: western historiography since the Enlightenment\u2019, in\nBentley, ed., Companion to historiography, pp. 395\u2013508.\n130 I am indebted to my colleague Gareth Austin for drawing John Phillips, Writing African history, Rochester:\nRochester University Press, 2005, to my attention.\n131 Stuchtey and Fuchs, eds., Writing world history.\n132 Eric Wolf, Europe and the people without history, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997.\n133 Federici, \u2018The God that never failed: the origins and crises of Western civilization\u2019, in Federici, ed.,\nEnduring civilization, pp. 63\u201391, and Linda Smith, Decolonizing methodologies, London: Zed Books,\n1999.\n24 j\nj\nP A T R I C K O \u2019 B R I E N\ndisdain. Through encounters, contacts and colonization, the West intruded deeply into the\nautonomies of other cultures, and permeated the writing of their histories, which became,\nin large measure, dominated by responses, rejections, celebrations or subtle assimilations\nof its achievements. This occurred even for Animist African and Hindu societies, who\ntook up and developed the writing of histories as ideological weapons against colonial\nrule.134 Marshall Hodgson recognized that \u2018once Western transmutation got underway it\ncould neither be paralleled independently nor borrowed wholesale\u2019.135 Thus the writing of\nIslamic, Chinese, Indian, African and even Japanese history has continued to reflect\nwell-documented tensions between traditions and universal desires for modernity with\nautonomy. Such tensions could only, moreover, remain more acute outside the West,\nwhere change could more easily be welcomed as indigenous and imminent, and as a\nfelicitous congruence of tradition with progress.\nMeanwhile the writing of histories emanating from non-Western cultures (including\nthose of recent origin out of Africa and Hindu India) displayed diversities over time, but\nfor the purposes of this simplified exposition can be located on a spectrum between\nhistoriographies that either embraced, rejected or, in varying ways, attempted to include\nand assimilate examples and methods from Europe into their own ways of writing history.136\nPerhaps nowhere else has the tension over the reconstruction of the past remained more\nacute than among Muslims. A minority explored pre-Islamic traditions, most notably in\nEgypt, Persia, and Turkey, and thereby served the interests of state formation, national\nidentities and independence.137 Confronted with a stance of triumphant arrogance,\nmost Muslim intellectuals rejected Western claims to moral, cultural and spiritual\nsuperiority.138 Ultra-conservative historians proceeded to reinforce myths of a lost golden\nage of Islamic civilization and power based (in their interpretations) upon the adherence\nof the umma, and above all Muslim elites, to eternal principles for all areas of personal,\nsocial and political life set out in the Qu\u2019ran.139 Reformers sought to acculturate Western\nmodernities, particularly science, technology and economic organization, but also the\nreconstruction of history, to Islamic values and traditions. In rewriting the rich and\ncomplex histories of the Caliphate, and of the Mughal, Safavid and Ottoman empires,\nMuslim historians have, however, confronted serious opposition from projects linked to\nalternative histories of Islamdom, written to sustain the authority of a sacred book.140\nSuch histories implicitly denigrate the contributions made by Muslims to the\naccumulation of secular knowledge that modern global history seeks to commend.141\n134 Philips, Historians of India.\n135 Hodgson, Rethinking world history, p. 215.\n136 Fuchs and Stuchtey, eds., Across cultural borders.\n137 Gamal Din El Shayal, \u2018Historiography of Egypt in the nineteenth century\u2019, Firuz Kazemzadeh, \u2018Iranian\nhistoriography\u2019, and Ercument Kuran, \u2018Ottoman historiography\u2019, in Lewis and Holt, eds., Historians of the\nMiddle East, pp. 405\u201337, and Brian Turner, Orientialism, postmodernism and globalism, London:\nRoutledge, 1994.\n138 Albert Hourani, Arabic thought in the liberal age 1798\u20131939, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1993.\n139 Pervez Hoodbhoy, Islam and science: religious orthodoxy and the battle for rationality, London: Zed\nBooks, 1990.\n140 Ira Lapidus, \u2018Islamic revivals and modernity: the contemporary movements and historical paradigms\u2019,\nJournal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 40, 4, 1997, pp. 444\u201356, and Lewis, Islam and\nthe West.\n141 Albert Hourani, A history of the Arab peoples, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1991.\nT H E R E S T O R A T I O N O F G L O B A L H I S T O R Y j\nj\n25\nChinese intellectuals did not have to contend with traditions based upon a divinely\ninspired book as they too grappled for more than two centuries with the artefacts and\nknowledge on offer through commerce and geopolitical conflicts with the West and Japan\non the one hand, and their own institutions and culture on the other.142 Rozman argues\nthat, \u2018perhaps in no other society of comparable complexity and development did a single\nintellectual framework establish such an encompassing hold over thinking about social\nbehaviour.\u2019143 Nevertheless, Confucian cultures never became as inflexible and dogmatic\nas their Islamic or Christian counterparts, and Confucianism continued as a vital intellectual\ntradition. Even so, it took Chinese savants several decades to extend, modify and recon-\nstruct the writing of China\u2019s history in ways that might conceivably have helped the Qing\nand Republican regimes to deal with a serious sequence of challenges to the external security\nand internal order of an empire becoming increasingly vulnerable to disintegration and\ntakeover.144\nFor example, one immediate (no doubt practical) response to humiliating defeat by\nBritain in the First Opium War in 1839\u201342, was to investigate the technical scope, scale,\nstrengths and weaknesses of the Royal Navy, as well as its history, in order to contain\nand fend off further penetration into the empire by maritime powers. The Chinese soon\nrecognized that the West had over time acquired functional knowledge that their state\ncould and should import to strengthen its defences. But, until compelled to do so, very\nfew intellectuals considered that the empire\u2019s foundational knowledge (including\nestablished views of the past upon which the state and its institutions rested) also required\nserious reform. Instead historians produced consoling and potentially instructive histories\nof military successes by Qing armies.145 Until late in the nineteenth century, they offered\nlittle to challenge the dominant genre of dynastic history that implicitly supported a\ncomplacent view that for millennia the governance of the empire had evolved (with\noccasional changes of regime) through cycles of chaos and instability, followed by\ndifficult periods of \u2018restoration\u2019, which sooner or later reproduced the security, good\norder and equilibrium of their own superior civilization.146\nElman\u2019s remark that \u2018it would be a historiographical mistake to underestimate Chinese\nefforts to master on their own terms what they called Western learning\u2019 is, however, well\ntaken.147 Modern historians have attempted to summarize and comprehend the voluminous\nliteratures composed by Chinese historians (and other intellectuals) concerned with their\ncountry\u2019s visible loss of power, the disintegration of traditional values, and erosion of\nself-respect.148 With sympathy, they have conveyed the laudable attempts made by a lineage\nof distinguished historians to acquire Europe\u2019s supposedly \u2018scientific\u2019 modes of writing\n142 John Gregory, The West and China since 1500, Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2003.\n143 Gil Rozman, The East Asian region.

Many supported the\n\u2018back to basics\u2019 policies followed by the state in the wake of the highly destructive\nTaiping Rebellion, and reposited their faith in China\u2019s great traditions, as portrayed in\nMary Wright\u2019s Last Stand of Chinese Conservatism.151 However this attitude lost steam\nafter 1870.\nTheir opponents promoted modernization that eventually ran into the intellectual cage\nof Sovietized Marxism. Meanwhile they studied Western ways of writing history, as well\nas the example closer to home set by Japan\u2019s Meiji Restoration, and engaged with the\ncomplex task of reconfiguring China\u2019s heritage in ways that could reconcile tradition with\nmodernity.152 They did so by subjecting canonical Confucian texts to rigorous criticism,\nrediscovering neglected sources, and above all selecting and emphasizing historical examples\nfrom the Empire\u2019s long complex and multiple traditions, in order to offer reinterpretations\nthat could not be dismissed as attacks on China\u2019s past or the integrity of the nation\u2019s\nidentity.153 They deconstructed and historicized views of the past, became trans-national\nin their methods and epistemologies, and negotiated between tradition and present needs\nin order to revive pride and patriotism in a nation and polity that almost disappeared\nalong with the Ottoman, Romanov and Habsburg empires during the upheavals of\nthe twentieth century.154 Ironically, they also constructed historical narratives that\n\u2018naturalized\u2019 Qing conquests in the far west of the Empire.\nUnfortunately as Paul Ricoeur has observed, \u2018before the coherence of the text comes the\ncoherence of history.\u2019 The turmoil of Japanese invasion and civil war produced conditions\nfor the foundation of a Peoples\u2019 Republic, twenty-five years of isolation from external\ninfluences, and the oppression associated with an all-pervasive ideology of Sovietized\nMarxism, mutating into Maoism.155 In a sense, decades of endeavours by several\ngenerations of Chinese historians before 1949 to reconfigure their national past paved the\nway for the acceptance of Marxism, particularly its teleological view of history,\n149 Mak, \u2018The middle kingdom\u2019, pp. 291\u2013308.\n150 Edward Wang, Inventing China through history, Albany: State University of New York, 2001.\n151 Wright, The last stand of Chinese conservatism.\n152 Pamela Crossley, A translucent mirror: history and identity in Qing imperial ideology, Berkeley: University\nof California Press, 1999.\n153 Paul Cohen, Between tradition and modernity: Wang Tao and reforms in late Ching China, Cambridge,\nMA: Harvard University Press, 1974.\n154 Wang, Inventing China.

They rejected orthodox views of stasis correlated with Asiatic\nmodes of production, and linear connexions, posited by Stalinists, between peasant sub-\nstructures and China\u2019s imperial superstructures of oriental despotism. They preferred to\nconcentrate upon the revolutionary potential of Asia\u2019s agrarian masses and struggles\nagainst Western imperialism.157 Marxism turned China\u2019s historians in universalizing\ndirections. Even before the death of Mao and the opening to the West in the 1980s, they\nbegan to discover \u2018sprouts of capitalism\u2019 and autonomous trajectories towards modernity\nin their own history, as far back as the Sung dynasty.158 Much of the impetus for this\ncame from Japanese sinologists, many of them Marxists.\nMy reading of historiographical surveys suggests that over the last three decades China\u2019s\nhistorians have moved back onto a trend that virtually continues with the project (inter-\nrupted by an interlude of oppressive ideological orthodoxy from 1949\u201376) of reconciling\ntheir traditions with the changes required for their own specific transition to a successful\nindustrial market economy. Recent reconfigurations leave almost no space for crude stage\ntheories derived from Marx, let alone Stalin, or for modernization theories, pace Rostow\nor Black. They concentrate upon China\u2019s historical contributions to science, technology,\nurbanization, commercialization and the formation of markets. For example, historians\nnow laud historical examples of Chinese entrepreneurship.159 In the writings of Sun\nYatsen, they find support for partnerships between the state and private enterprise, and\npositive views towards the import of foreign capital, expertise and enterprise.160 Edward\nWang observed: \u2018while every great culture has its perpetual value, this value is valuable\nnot because it becomes a tradition but because people can reflect, rediscover and\nrecreate it.\u2019161 Chinese history has become trans-national in its epistemology, but is only\njust becoming global in scope and vision. Nevertheless, the century-long preoccupation of\nChina\u2019s historians with the reconciliation of their tradition with Western modernity may\nserve better than any forays into micro-histories, biographies and other post-modern\ntropes to construct meta-narratives in world history to \u2018provincialize\u2019 the West.\nFurthermore, Chinese historians have resumed the programme marked by the publication\n156 Dorothea Martin, \u2018The making of a Sino-Marxist world view: perceptions and interpretations of world\nhistory\u2019, in The People\u2019s Republic of China, Armonk: M.E.

Under the Tokugawa regime, and supported by histor-\nicized interpretations from the islands\u2019 own sages and savants, historical texts were in place\nwhich separated Japanese from Chinese traditions, legitimizing a succession of Shoguns rul-\ning in the name of a quasi-divine line of Emperors going back to Japan\u2019s mythical age.164\nWhen the Meiji Restoration replaced the Bakufu (which had failed to protect Japan\nfrom encroachments and possible takeover by imperialist powers), the new regime also\nencountered less effective resistance than rulers of China to opening the country to imports\nof Western commodities, scientific and technical knowledge and even religious missionary\nactivity.165 Like their Tokugawa predecessors, the new aristocratic regime immediately\ninstructed historians to produce textually validated justifications for their takeover of\npower, and strategies to restore traditional practices and expectations concerning relations\nbetween the emperor and his obedient subjects.166 Its edict is worth paraphrasing: \u2018Histor-\niography is forever an immortal state ritual. Now the evil of misrule . . . has been overcome\nand imperial rule restored . . . we wish that an office of historiography be established, that\nthe good custom of our ancestors be resumed and that knowledge and education be spread\nthroughout the land. . . . Let us set right relations between monarch and subject, distinguish\nclearly between alien and proper and implant virtue throughout our land.\u2019 As Margaret\nMehl underlines, \u2018the wording . . . suggests the reinstation and stabilization of a previous\norder which assigned everyone to their place in the state and Japan to its place in the\nworld\u2019.167 \u2018Historians responded to the challenge and set about legitimising the restoration,\nelevating the quasi-divine and mythical status of imperial rule and elaborating on the duties\nand loyalties from subjects with reference to dynastic records and annals of a ruling house\nthat could trace its ancestry back for more than two millennia; and in particular to\nmodels of the Nara and Heian period of imperial rule.\u2019168\nIn their endeavours to restore and reinvent tradition, they found no difficulty in\nembracing the philological methods, verification of sources, validation of interpretations,\n162 I am indebted to my colleague Kent Deng for references in Chinese to Zhou Gucheng, ShijieTonshi,\nShanghai: Commercial Press, 1949, and to Wu Yugin and Qi Shirong, eds., Shijie Shi, Beijing: Beijing\nUniversity Press, 1991\u201394.

Adapted scientific methods reinforced Japanese traditions and matured into an\nenduring canon for academic history.169 Although \u2018the passion\u2019 for accuracy was not\nmatched by any attempts to analyse, explain and interpret the nation\u2019s past, popular his-\ntories from the pens of Fukuzawa Yukichi, Tajuchi Ukrichi, and Yamaji Gizan (influenced\nby Western social science and narratives of progress) satisfied the hunger for more popular\nhistories locating Japan\u2019s place in the world.170\nWithin a quarter of a century of the Restoration, the Japanese state developed into\na successful maritime and imperial power, and Japan\u2019s status in the hierarchy of world\npowers began to be represented by intellectuals, (impatient with Western, including\nMarxist, teleologies of stages) in modified vocabularies drawn from Social Darwinism.171\nCoupled with claims that they had to lead other Asian powers (including China) to resist\nWestern imperialism, these arguments encountered virtually no resistance from academic\nhistorians immersed in the details of scientific research, whose scholarly texts had contrib-\nuted to solidify obedience and loyalty to the emperor system into the hallmarks of Japan\u2019s\nnational identity.172\nThat particular mission for a land of the Gods with a divine emperor was shattered by\ndefeat and the terrible destruction of the Pacific War. Under American occupation Japanese\nintellectuals rediscovered a place for their own past within universal trajectories, mapped\nout by Western social science that could be derived either from Modernization theory173\nor Marxism. The latter had remained as a powerful current of thought among Japanese his-\ntorians of the 1920s and 1930s, even if it had been progressively forced underground. When\nthe economy converged rapidly towards the high standards of material welfare achieved by\nthe West, most historians passively accepted a representation of their nation\u2019s success as an\nisland of European modernity off the coast of Asia. Latterly a younger generation (but with-\nout chauvinism) are beginning to reconfigure Japan\u2019s trajectory into yet another example of\nmultiple modernities, promoted by its own traditions, and (what is more significant for the\nconstruction of meta-narratives in global history) they have relocated it within the contexts\nthat illuminate Asian contributions to global development.174\nIn a sense the weakness of indigenous historiographical traditions, epistemological con-\nventions and institutionalized frameworks for the writing of history released Indian (parti-\ncularly Hindu) intellectuals to construct a past that could support the formation of a\nmodern nation state, and at the same time reposition the profound contributions made by\nthe peoples of South Asia to world history.175 The first task required inordinate attention\n169 Julia Thomas, \u2018High anxiety: world history\u2019, pp. 309\u201326.\n170 Stefan Tanaka, \u2018Alternative national histories in Japan: Yamaji Aizan and academic historiography\u2019, in\nFuchs and Stuchtey, eds., Across cultural borders, pp. 119\u201340.\n171 Thomas, \u2018High anxiety: world history\u2019, pp. 309\u201326.\n172 Stefan Tanaka, \u2018Alternative national histories\u2019, pp. 119\u201340.\n173 Sebastian Conrad, \u2018The opened and closed country: conflicting views of Japan\u2019s position in the world\u2019, in\nStuchtey and Fuchs, eds., Writing world history, pp. 327\u201352.\n174 Yoshino Kosaku, Cultural nationalism in contemporary Japan, London: Routledge, 1992, and Kaoru\nSugihara, \u2018The East Asian path of economic development: a long-term perspective\u2019, in Arrighi et al., eds.,\nThe resurgence of East Asia, London: Routledge, 2003, pp. 78\u2013123.\n175 Michael Gottlieb, \u2018India\u2019s connection to history: the discipline and the relation between center and\nperiphery\u2019, in Fuchs and Stuchtey, eds., Across cultural borders, pp. 75\u201398.\n30 j\nj\nP A T R I C K O \u2019 B R I E N\nbecause for more than two centuries Indian historians (Hindu and Muslim alike) had\nresearched, written and taught history in the context of colonial and post-colonial rule.176\nBeginning in 1765, first the East India Company and later the Raj promoted the diffusion\nof histories that provided ideological justifications for the takeover of India, and support\nfor the reconstruction of its political, economic and social institutions along metropolitan\nlines. For that mission the British found willing collaborators among the Indian middle\nclass for their projects to bring Western technologies, education, property rights and other\ninstitutions to the sub-continent. Indians recognized the cultural and political purposes of\nwriting history in \u2018scientific ways\u2019, but there was, declaimed Ranajit Guha, \u2018one Indian\nbattle that Britain never won. It was a battle for appropriation of an Indian past.\u2019177\nWithin decades of the takeover of Bengal by the East India Company, in schools and\ncolleges established by the imperial power, Indians began to write histories modelled\nalong European lines in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi and Urdu.178 Their histories,\nmaturing in scope and scale to lend valuable ideological support to nationalist movements\nfor self-government, independence and unity contested all misrepresentations of \u2018their\u2019\npast by foreigners, claimed a distinct and distinguished position in world history for their\nancient civilization and entered into controversies with rival English interpretations over\nseminal episodes in the history of European colonization, including the tyranny and\ndecadence of the Mughal empire, the conquest of Bengal, the highly sensitive \u2018mutiny\u2019 of\n1857, and the Amritsar massacre of 1919.179\nThe long and sustained struggle against British occupation generated a large and sophis-\nticated volume of scholarship on both sides of the argument. India\u2019s historiographical tradi-\ntion is marked by libraries of books that are situated, contextualized and analysed as\nresponses and reactions to colonial rule. From the standpoint of modern global history,\nSouth Asian history looks unbalanced by a truncated concentration upon the last three cen-\nturies, and by a restriction of focus to the public sphere.180 However, post-independence\nscholarship is now productively engaged in reclaiming major areas of history from the\npreoccupation with politics and state formation. Once that has been accomplished, the\nspecificities of Indian private and communal life, the long-term growth of the economy,\ncultural developments, gender, caste, the peasantry and the fraught histories of relations\nbetween Hindus and Muslims can be properly historicized and resituated into global\ncontexts and concerns where, at present, China and the West loom large compared to\nIndia and Africa.181\nTo sum up: conditions for the rise of universal history embracing every region and\nsociety of the Afro-Eurasian Oikumene emerged as celebrations, reactions and responses\n176 Ranajit Guha, An Indian historiography of India, Calcutta: K.P.

In contrast to\nJapan, Islamdom appears to have experienced severe difficulties in reordering its culture\n(including the reconstruction of histories) to assimilate a package of modernities on offer\nthrough connexions, commerce and conflicts with an intrusive West. South Asian\nintellectuals, after the British takeover of Bengal, had no choice but to take up the\nchallenge posed by the attempts of their new rulers and mentors to appropriate their\nneglected history, in the interests of securing compliance with colonial governance.\nTelescoped into resistance, with some loss of scope and depth, South Asian history\nmatured into a formidable ideological weapon for the formation of Hindu, Muslim\nand secular nationalist consciousness required to support the long struggle for the\nindependence of India and Pakistan.182 Finally, China\u2019s Confucian cosmology and\nepistemological conventions for the construction of history turned out to be plastic\nenough to help an ancient empire survive formidable external and internal threats to its\nintegrity and to reorder the nation\u2019s culture in order to reconcile tradition with modernity.\nImperatives and prospects for global history\nAs an outcome of some three centuries of sustained and latterly intensified connexions\nacross the Afro-Asian Oikumene, flows of information (including historical scholarship\ndealing with every corner of the modern world) have cumulated and diffused on an\nunprecedented scale. Histories are also now filtered, classified and fed into more useable\nand universal theories of economic, social and cultural change than anything available to\ncanonical traditions in social science from Montesquieu to Weber. After centuries of\nconflict and controversy over religion and national identities, which have conditioned the\nwriting of history since the Reformation, prospects for the construction of cosmopolitan\nmeta-narratives in global history (recognized as disciplined and accepted everywhere as\nheuristic for scholarly debate) look better than at any time since Voltaire.\nUnless retrogressions towards fundamentalisms resurge, meta-narratives for the twenty-\nfirst century will, hopefully, leave behind more than two millennia of historical writing\ndesigned to proclaim and validate the spiritual, moral and cultural superiorities of\nEgyptian, Hellenistic, Christian, Byzantine, Islamic, Confucian, Hindu, African and other\ncivilizations.183 Alas, it will take more time and scholarly debate to move on from\ncelebrations and repudiations of a tradition of chronologically foreshortened and spatially\nconfined narratives preoccupied with praising, adapting (and denigrating) Western\nachievements in science, technology, economic organization and warfare that have\npervaded and continue to inform two centuries of historical writing from all quarters of\nthe world.184\nMeanwhile two strands of current historiographical debates over the future of global\nhistory seem subject to decreasing intellectual returns.

Historians need to craft new, more\ninclusive and persuasive general narratives that might hold together without the fishy glue\nof Eurocentrism.\nFrom the time of the Reformation onwards, Anglo-, Franco-, Hispano-, Germano- and\nother \u2018centric\u2019 histories became and have remained dominant in the historiography of\nevery European nation.188 Claims to cultural, moral, spiritual, even ethnic superiority are\nit seems endemic to nationalisms of all kinds, and are not a monopoly of the West. How\nmany intellectuals writing after 1789 proclaimed that the possession of scientific,\ntechnical, economic and military knowledge carried moral power?189 After all, narratives\nof enlightenment, as constructed by Voltaire and his generation, did at least try to break\nout of the cosmological constraints, nationalistic ideologies and mercantilist assumptions\nof the Ancien Re\u00b4gime.190 And more than a century later, in a climate of pessimism and\nbreakdown of the liberal consensus that followed from the awesome destruction of the\nGreat European Civil War of 1914 to 1918, another small group of erudite scholars\n(Spengler, Toynbee, Sorokin, Mumford, Wells and Dawson) wrote universal histories of\nmankind to help us comprehend the \u2018decline of the West\u2019.191 Their scholarship and\naspiration to explain the demise of Christianity and rationality (anticipated by Nietzsche)\nare inspiring.

They are right to be apprehensive. Cultures are\nbeing more visibly re-ordered by advertising, fashion, and the popular arts, especially\nmusic. The means and media of modern transportation and communications (now cheaper\nand more accessible than ever to the masses) are opening up discourses (usually in English)\nthat are reshaping national identities and personal behaviour around the world, especially\namong younger generations.198 In the West anxieties (exaggerated by \u2018official\u2019\nintellectuals) have, moreover, been compounded by the technological and economic\nachievements of several Asian societies\u2014first, Japan and the \u2018Tigers\u2019, and latterly China\nand India.199 As the rest, as they have for millennia of recorded history, proceed to\nconverge on the front runners, modern \u2018mercantilists\u2019, who conceive of the world in terms\nof winners and losers, worry how best to deal with a rather gradual decline of European\nand American hegemony.200 Pressures to construct, write and to teach histories that might\n193 Gilbert Allardyce, \u2018Towards world history.

This looks set to\ncontinue and should be welcomed as a return to the ecumenical missions of Herodotus,\nSima Qian, Mas\u2019udi, Ibn Khaldun, Vico, Voltaire, Leibniz, Lamprecht, Weber, Toynbee,\nSpengler, Wells, Nehru and DuBois, as well as responses to eloquent calls from the Mid-\nWest from our modern Godfathers, Stavrianos, McNeill and Hodgson.201\nVenerable and contemporary arguments for resituating local and national histories into\nconceptual frameworks that might address the problems of a new millennium have been\npersuasively restored and rehearsed by proselytizers for global history since Marshall Hodg-\nson published his seminal essays in the 1950s and 1960s.202 Nevertheless it is the rejection\nof the whole project, and recommendations that historians concentrate attention upon\nmicro-histories of difference, diversity, locality, biography, adopting a stance of\nepistemological humility towards the complex histories of unknowable and hitherto\nexcluded \u2018others\u2019, that seems to have produced some of the best and most provocative\nhistoriographical writing in recent years.203\nOne eminent Indian philosopher, Ashish Nandy, has called for \u2018the abandonment of his-\ntory\u2019 as \u2018maybe the only heresy left to us\u2019, while the dangers of reviving long-forgotten\nhistories have been eloquently elaborated by Vinay Lal.204 His rejection of secular history\nbased upon epistemological categories and concepts derived from the Enlightenment and\nWestern social science is treated seriously by many post-modern historians.205 Arif Dirlik\nhas reminded us that \u2018Euro-Americans conquered the world; renamed places; rearranged\neconomies, societies and polities; erased or drove to the margins pre-modern ways of\nknowing space, time and many other things\u2019.206 Similarly Linda Smith rejects European\nways of knowing and representing the past because \u2018colonialism meant not only the\nimposition of Western authority over indigenous lands, modes of production and\nindigenous laws and government, but the imposition of Western authority over all aspects\nof indigenous knowledge, languages and cultures\u2019.207 Following Foucault, this version of\nthe \u2018linguistic turn\u2019 asserts that \u2018real power lies with those who design the tools\u2019, and\nanticipates that emancipation from the malign cultural impact of the West involves a\nrepudiation of its foundational categories, including a conscious intellectual endeavour to\nreclaim indigenous ways of comprehending and representing the past.208\n201 William McNeill, \u2018The rise of the West after twenty five years\u2019, Journal of World History, 1, 1, 1990,\npp. 1\u201320.\n202 Marshall Hodgson, Rethinking history; Pomper et al., World History, and see the articles published by\nAllardyce, Brooks, Christian, Curtin, Frank and Green in the Journal of World History referenced in the\nbibliography of Manning\u2019s Navigating world history.\n203 Well-referenced surveys of the case against global history by Arif Dirlik and Vinay Lal are included in two\ncollections edited by Fuchs and Stuchtey, Across cultural borders and Stuchtey and Fuchs, Writing world\nhistory.\n204 Ashish Nandy, \u2018History\u2019s forgotten doubles\u2019, History and Theory, 34, 2, 1995, p. 46, and Vinay Lal, The\nhistory of history; politics and scholarship in modern India, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2005.\n205 Amartya Sen, \u2018The threats to secular India\u2019, New York Review of Books, 8 April 1993.\n206 Dirlik, \u2018Reflections on eurocentrism\u2019, p. 260.\n207 Smith, Decolonizing methodologies, p. 64.\n208 Gyan Prakash, \u2018Writing post-orientalist histories of the third world.

Yes, Europeans claimed, and continue to claim, exclu-\nsive property rights over ways of comprehending the world including its history. Europeans\nposed the questions, specified codes for the practice of \u2018scientific\u2019 styles of research,\nestablished rules for validation and debate, and marshalled theories, taxonomies, and cate-\ngories derived from Western social science, to facilitate the selection, arrangement and\nchains of inferences drawn from historical evidence.209 Under colonial or neo-colonial\nconditions, which operated to exclude, ridicule or silence alternative ways of recording and\nusing a more inclusive past, history could become repressive and promote imperial\ndominion and domination.210 Equally, as any survey of historiographies from India,\nChina, Japan, South Asia and Islamdom reveals, histories could also be written to preserve\nindigenous traditions and to resist assimilation.211 Furthermore our colleagues have not\nmade it clear how the reclamation of traditional ways of knowing and representing\nIslamic, Hindu, Christian, Confucian, Amerindian, African or any versions of the past\nwould serve the needs of the present any better than the portfolio of methods and\napproaches that are now the hallmarks of modern history.212 Their programmes might just\nregress into deplorable varieties of myths supporting chauvinism and ancient \u2018centrisms\u2019.213\nAnxieties about agendas for the revival of global history remain, and scholars are under-\nstandably concerned that any restoration of the genre will continue to celebrate triumphs of\nthe West. Alas, they are not misconceived, because recent publications offering overviews of\nworld history, mainly by journalists, but too often by professional historians, seem trun-\ncated in chronology, confined in space, devoid of references to environments and selective\nin areas of human endeavour that qualify for recognition as universal achievements.214\nAs serious humanistic scholarship, global history aims to mature into a renaissance, leav-\ning behind the arrogance of Rome, aspirations for a universal Caliphate, the moral preten-\nsions of doctrinal Confucianism, claims for spiritual superiority associated with Hinduism,\nBuddhism and Christianity, as well as the scientific and technological triumphalism of the\nWest.215 After all, history today is nothing if not a capaciously catholic subject. Admission\ninto world history is no longer a problem. The subject clearly takes all kinds of hitherto\nmyopic exclusions into its narratives. It repositions validated knowledge of the past into\nrelevant geographies, a plurality of chronologies, and an evolving body of theory drawn\nfrom both natural and social sciences. It includes global histories of commodities (sugar,\ntea, coffee, silver, opium, cotton, silk, etc.); economic activities (such as banking, mining\nand transportation); socially gendered and interpersonal relations; as well as topics of uni-\nversal concern like politics, warfare and science. Everything has its history, and nearly\n209 Young, White mythologies.\n210 Guha, Dominance without hegemony.\n211 For a telling example see David Kopf, \u2018A look at Nehru\u2019s world history from the dark side of modernity\u2019,\nJournal of World History, 2, 1, 1991, pp. 47\u201363, and Philip Curtin, The world and the West.

They must expect to debate their valid claims for more space, but will rarely confront\nresistance to endeavours to locate their scholarship within reconfigured narratives in global\nhistory. On the contrary, the publications of master narratives by Chinese, Japanese, Indian,\nAfrican and Middle Eastern historians is overdue, and would be a welcome addition to what\nis recognized as too much of a Western enterprise.\nFurthermore, the status of Western categories, taxonomies, concepts, theories and other\nways for understanding and writing history have become far less constricting. Modern\nsocial science written outside the West is often related to alternative epistemological tradi-\ntions of classifying and knowing the past. Today, when historians are offered such a\nplethora of competing approaches and models to work with, exhortations to reject repres-\nsions embodied in Western foundational categories become difficult to comprehend. To\nsome degree, Foucault\u2019s insights should remain in our minds. Yes, canonical social science\nfrom Smith through Marx to Weber created images, privileged vocabularies, reified statis-\ntics, and imposed teleological views of the past that could be repressive for those resisting\nthe political, economic and ideological power of the West.217 Nevertheless, as many Indian,\nChinese, Japanese, African and Muslim intellectuals confronted the challenge, they soon\nrealized Western knowledge could also be liberating and adapted for local purposes. Today\nwhen the range of categories, concepts, methods and theories on offer from the social\nsciences is heterodox and the property of many cultures, it seems like an abnegation of\nintellectual responsibility to pretend that enlightenment and emancipation could emerge\nby retreating into micro-histories, local vocabularies, provincializing the West, and\ndeconstructing the multiplicity of theories and categories now available for the writing of\nmeta-narratives in history. The latter could help societies everywhere with urgent tasks\nof reconciling their traditions with a proliferating variety of modernities, as well as\nreconciling local or national aspirations with those that are truly global, such as\nenvironmental degradation, malnutrition, human rights and other problems of universal\nconcern.218\nOf course, historians taking the risk of writing global histories should remain aware\nof the origins, provenance and relevance of the categories and theories that they use to\nreconstruct the past, and respond to the challenge to invent fresh vocabularies, categories\nand theories to incorporate not only new evidence, but also alternative perspectives on the\npast.219 Nevertheless, there must be something more than an ambition to research and\nteach histories that offer what Dipesh Chakrabarty calls, \u2018a loving grasp of detail in search\nof the diversity of human life worlds\u2019.220\nUnless such stoical engagements with the recovery of personal meanings through\nbiographies concentrated upon private lives, upon subalterns and other examples of\n216 O\u2019Brien, \u2018An engagement with post-modern foes\u2019, pp. 1\u201332.

Nevertheless,\nwithout categories, concepts, theories, aggregation and quantification, there is little\nprospect for changing a status quo, and every chance that meta-narratives for world (and\nalso for national) histories will be constructed along \u2018centric\u2019 lines. They will be conveyed\nto audiences and readerships around the world by patriotic gatekeepers, with privileged\naccess to media of mass communication, and will continue to serve the interests of the\nwealthy, the powerful and the \u2018West\u2019.\nToday more people than ever before, living in every part of an increasingly interrelated\nworld, need education from history and the social sciences to help them comprehend the\nenvironmental, human and cultural diversities of their times. Such education might teach\nus all how to avoid derogatory chauvinism, simplistic assimilations and romanticized per-\nceptions, as we interact with ever increasing intensity with people from other traditions\nand places.221\nHistory as memory has always been a vital part of our personal identities and\nremains, in the form of narratives, a powerful component of everyone\u2019s local and\nnational consciousness. How such narratives are best constructed has been a source of\npersistent controversy among historians since Thucydides.222 Our profession continues\nto be preoccupied not, as postmodernists assert, with truth, but with an aspiration to\nobjectivity and a measure of ironic detachment from the intractable evidence at its dispo-\nsal. Most would agree, however, with Nietzsche\u2019s claim that painfully acquired \u2018knowl-\nedge of the past has at all times been desired in the service of the future and the\npresent.\u2019223\nAs I read them, the commitments and agendas of modern global history are not to\nspurious claims to scientific objectivity and personal impartiality, but to moral purposes,\nconnected to the needs of a globalizing world. Those needs require a reordering of classical\nand established historiographies from all cultures to make space for histories that are\nattempting to disengage from national, regional, ethnic and religious traditions. Such\nhistories would become involved with the construction of meta-narratives that might,\nat one and the same time, deepen our understanding of diversities and scale up our\nconsciousness of a human condition that has for millennia included global influences, and\nintermingled with local elements in all its essential dimensions.224\nIf they succeed, global history promises to be useful by identifying, selecting and laying\nout an unfolding past of large-scale compelling happenings in contexts that might raise\nawareness of the lives, achievements and sufferings of humanity as a whole. As publicly\nfunded custodians of the past, historians are well placed to construct disciplined,\n221 Martha Nussbaum, Cultivating humanity.

Synoptic views,\nembodying perspectives from across ancient divides of nationalism, religions and cultures,\nwill not be easy to compose. They will be recognized, however, by the interrelated range\nof questions they raise, and not by their prior commitments to evidence that is\nunavoidably provisional, or to constricted chronologies and confined spatial parameters.\nThey will also become known for the plurality of theories and categories deployed to\nselect, arrange and represent the past in ways that will continue to constrain the form and\nstructures of all historical narratives.\nThe launch of this journal is surely timely. It will succeed because the articles published\nover years to come will be selected to help historians willing to take the epistemological and\nprofessional risks involved in writing or addressing meta-narratives for global history to\nforge improved foundational categories and theories, to select trustworthy scholarship,\nand to represent the past in ways that might promote cross-cultural conversations\nrecognized as useful for the future of mankind.
